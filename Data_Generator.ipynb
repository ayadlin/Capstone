expression of this pathway is frequently altered in breast cancer due to mutations at or aberrant expression of: HER2, ERalpha, BRCA1, BRCA2, EGFR1, PIK3CA, PTEN, TP53, RB as well as other oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.', 'In some breast cancer cases, mutations at certain components of this pathway (e.g., PIK3CA) are associated with a better prognosis than breast cancers lacking these mutations.', 'The expression of this pathway and upstream HER2 has been associated with breast cancer initiating cells (CICs) and in some cases resistance to treatment.', 'The anti-diabetes drug metformin can suppress the growth of breast CICs and herceptin-resistant HER2+ cells.', 'This review will discuss the importance of the EGFR PI3K PTEN Akt  mTORC1 GSK-3 pathway primarily in breast cancer but will also include relevant examples from other cancer types.', 'The targeting of the hormone receptor, HER2 and EGFR1 in breast cancer will be reviewed in association with suppression of the EGFR PI3K PTEN Akt mTORC1 GSK-3 pathway.', 'Mutations at or deregulation of certain genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, HER2, PIK3CA) and others play important roles in breast cancer [4-18].', 'Mutations or aberrant or deregulated expression of TP53, MDM2 and RB also can play roles in the therapeutic responses of breast cancer [19-26].', 'Restoration of functional TP53 activity can increase the sensitivity of some TP53 mutant cells to certain anticancer drugs [27].', 'Some breast cancers are due to hereditary mutations, namely those involving BRCA1 and BRCA2.', 'BRCA1 encodes breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein which is involved in DNA repair and is considered a caretaker gene.', 'The BRCA1 protein interacts with RNA polymerase II and also with histone deacetylase complexes [28].', 'BRCA1 plays key roles in transcription, repair of breaks in double stranded DNA as well as ubiquitination.', 'The BRCA1 protein also combines with other proteins which detect DNA damage and other cell signals and forms a multi-subunit protein complex known as the BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex (BASC) [29].', 'BRCA2 is also involved in the repair of DNA double strand breaks [30].', 'BRCA2 binds single stranded DNA.', 'For RAD51 to bind the DNA double-strand breaks, a complex of BRCA1 partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2) BRCA2 is required [31].', 'The risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer www.impactjournals.com oncotarget 4604  in individuals with certain cancer-associated BRCA1  BRCA2 alleles is 60-80% for breast cancer and 2040% for ovarian cancer.', 'In addition, other genes involved in DNA repair and signaling are implicated in breast cancer including: Fanconi anemia (FA) genes (FANCD2, FANCA and FANCC), mismatch repair genes (MutL homolog 1 [MLH1], MutS protein homolog 2 [MSH2], PMS1 protein homolog 1 [PMS1], mutS homolog 6 [MSH6]), mismatch repair endonuclease PMS2 [PMS2] and DNA repair genes (Ataxia telangiectasia mutated [ATM], Ataxia

phosphatase and tensin homolog [PTEN]) and protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) [32-44].', 'In an important study with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients, the frequency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and survival was examined [45].', 'DNA was isolated from tumor samples as well as normal tissues from 77 TNBC patients and the genetic sequence of the BRCA1 2 exons and flanking regions determined.', '19.5% of the TNBC patients had BRCA mutations, 15.6% were mutant at BRCA1, and 3.9% were mutant at BRCA2.', 'BRCA1 and BRCA2 are also mutated in patients with ovarian cancer [46].', 'BRCA1 2 mutations are present in approximately 11 to 15% of unselected ovarian cancer patients.', 'BRCA1 mutations were positively associated with TP53 mutations.', 'The presence of BRCA1 2 mutations after platinum chemotherapy were associated with improved progression free survival.', 'Deregulation of BRCA1 expression has been implicated in sporadic breast cancer.', 'The trinucleotideOncotarget  \\x0crepeat-containing 9 (TNRC9) gene has been shown to downregulate BRCA1 expression which results in breast cancer aggressiveness.', 'This group also determined that ectopic expression of TNRC9 affected breast cancer cell survival.', 'TNRC9 and BRCA1 protein expression were inversely correlated in large data sets of breast and ovarian cancer samples.', 'Interesting this group determined that TNRC9 bound to both the BRCA1 promoter and the cAMPresponsive element-binding protein (CREB) complex.', 'CREB is a regulator of BRCA1 transcription.', 'Finally TNRC9 expression suppressed BRCA1 expression by altering the methylation status of the BRCA1 promoter region.', 'Germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 are present in approximately 18% of hereditary ovarian cancers.', 'In this study, the prevalence of BRCA1 mutations in 106 familial Greek ovarian cancer patients who had a strong family history of ovarian cancer or metachronous breast cancer.', 'In addition, the prevalence of BRCA1 mutations were examined in 592 sporadic Greek ovarian cancer patients.', 'In Greece, it had been previously determined that there were 6 types of BRCA1 mutations that accounted for 63% of all the mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.', 'Deleterious BRCA1 mutations were observed in 40.6% of familial ovarian cancer cases and 4.6% of sporadic ovarian cases.', 'This study determined that 71.2% of the BRCA1 carriers presented a high-grade serous phenotype.', 'Hereditary breast cancer often results from disruption of the normal functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2.', 'In contrast BRCA1 BRCA2 are not necessarily mutated in sporadic breast cancer, but there may be mutations in TP53 and epigenetic alterations which change the expression of other genes.', 'These changes result in breast cancer cells which may be wild WT at BRCA1 and BRCA2 but have defects in DNA repair.', 'In addition certain sporadic breast cancers may have hypermethylation of the BRCA1, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and other genes which prevents or lowers their expression.', 'In one study, the frequencies of methylation in the www.impactjournals.com oncotarget 4605  BRCA1 promoter region were examined in 96 sporadic invasive breast carcinomas and 43 sporadic ovarian carcinomas.', 'Methylation of the BRCA1 promoter was linked with lack of ER and PR expression in these tumors [65].', 'High-penetrance genes include: BRCA1, BRCA2, PTEN and TP53, which in many cases are responsible at least in part for the familiar breast cancer.', 'The genetic structures of the TP53, BRCA1, ATM, and PIK3CA genes were examined in 145 Bulgarian patients with sporadic breast cancer.', 'The expression of HER2 was examined by immunohistochemistry and chromogenic hybridization in situ (CISH) [67].', 'In this study, mutations were observed: at TP53 in 22.07% of the patients, at BRCA1 in 0.69% of the patients, at ATM in 7.59% of the patients, and in 31.25% of the patients at PIK3CA.', 'Overexpression of HER2 was observed in 21.21% of the patients.', 'Mutations at TP53 were associated with both tumor size and grade of malignancy.', 'Mutations at PIK3CA were associated with PR+ tumors.', 'HER2 overexpression was correlated with the age of the patient when diagnosed with breast cancer, tumor size and ER+.', 'This important study documented that TP53 mutations were an indicator for poorer outcome.', 'Chk2 is involved both in TP53 and cell-cycle pathways.', 'In some Li-Fraumeni syndrome families, which have germline mutations at TP53, mutations at CHK2 have also be observed.', 'Elevated c-Myc expression leads to a poor prognosis in sporadic breast cancer patients that are BRCA1-deficient [69].', 'In this important study, the presence of BRCA1 gene expression was examined in 374 sporadic breast cancer patients.', 'BRCA1 expression was lacking in 60.4% of the breast cancer patients.', 'Patients that lost BRCA1 expression often had more advanced breast cancer and were tumor node metastasis stage III positive, lymph node positive and overexpressed c-Myc.', 'The presence of hypermethylation of the BRCA1 promoter region was examined.', 'BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation was observed in 16.4% of the breast cancer patients examined and was associated with BRCA1-, ER- , c-Myc overexpression, and the triple-negative phenotype.', 'Thus loss of functional BRCA1 expression combined with increased expression of c-Myc was associated with a poor prognosis.', 'Alteration of TP53 in Breast Cancer.', 'Dysregulation of the TP53 gene also occurs in sporadic breast cancer [70].', 'The genetic structure of the TP53 gene was examined in 136 unselected sporadic breast cancer patients tumors.', 'Approximately 40% of the tumor samples had TP53 mutations.', 'Moreover, this group postulated that these mutations were due to exposure of the breast cancer patients to environmental mutagens based on the frequency of G-T transversions and the incidence of guanosine mutations on the non-transcribed DNA strand of the TP53 gene.', 'Polymorphisms of the TP53 gene have been observed to have prognostic and predictive values in cancer therapy.', 'The presence of two TP53 gene polymorphisms, Arg72Pro and PIN3 (+16 bp) was observed in ninety-four women with sporadic breast cancer who were followed for a mean of 67.9 months after therapy [71].', 'However, this study observed that the patients which www.impactjournals.com oncotarget 4606  Expression of EGFR Family Members in Breast Cancer Patients.', 'The EGFR family consists of four members.', 'For the sake clarity in this review, we will refer to them as EGFR1 (a.k.a., EGFR, HER1, c-erbB1), HER2 (a.k.a., EGFR2, c-erbB2), EGFR3 (a.k.a., c-erbB3, HER3) and EGFR4 (a.k.a., c-erbB4, HER4).', 'The expression of the EGFR1, HER2, EGFR3 and EGFR4 were examined by immunohistochemistry in 220 breast cancer carcinomas [75].', 'Increased expression of EGFR1 was detected in Oncotarget  \\x0c16.4% of the tumors, increased expression of HER2 was observed in 22.8% of the tumors, increased expression of EGFR3 was detected in 17.5% of the tumors, and increased expression of EGFR4 was observed in 11.9% of tumors.', 'Breast cancer patients with tumors that overexpressed EGFR1, HER2 or EGFR3 had reduced survival.', 'In contrast, those breast cancer patients whose tumors displayed elevated levels EGFR4 had better survival than the breast cancer patient that expressed EGFR1, HER2 or EGFR3.', 'Thus overexpression of EGFR1, HER2 and EGFR3 was association with a poor prognosis in breast cancer patients.', 'In addition, this group investigated the association of ER expression with the different EGFR molecules.', 'Expression of EGFR1, HER2 and EGFR3 was associated with ER negativity in the breast cancer patients.', 'Moreover those breast cancer patients that were ER+ and also EGFR1+, HER2+ or EGFR3+ had poorer survival than those breast cancer patients which were either ER+ and HER2+ or EGFR4+.', 'Additional studies were performed by the same group on the proliferative potential of the different types of EGFR-expressing cells [76].', 'These important studies suggest that EGFR1, HER2 and EGFR3 are linked with tumor proliferation, while EGFR4 did not appear to drive proliferation but may even play protective roles.', '59% of ERtumors, 63% of lymph node+ tumors and 63% of HER2 tumors were positive for EGFR3 expression.', '67% of EGFR1+, 67% of HER2+ (67%), 75% TP53+ and 60% of cathepsin-D+ DCIS were positive for EGFR3 expression.', 'The expression of EGFR1, HER2, EGFR3 and EGFR4 was examined in 100 breast cancer patients [78].', 'By using immunohistochemistry techniques, 36% of the breast cancer samples were positive for EGFR1, 27%, of the breast cancer samples were positive of HER2, 26% of the breast cancer samples were positive for EGFR3 and 82% of the breast cancer samples were positive for EGFR4.', 'An association between decreased disease-free survival and expression of HER2 was observed.', 'Co-expression of EGFR1 and HER2 was associated with a worse prognosis.', 'EGFR4 expression appeared to antagonize the effects on HER2 on clinical outcome in the breast cancer patients which expressed both.', 'The luminal breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and T47D cells expressed both ER-alpha and EGFR4.', 'The expression patterns of EGFR1, HER2, EGFR3 and EGFR4 were examined by real-time RT-PCR in 365 unselected primary breast cancers [80].', 'EGFR1 and HER2 were negatively associated with ER+ and PR+ breast cancers.', 'In a subsequent study with the ER-alpha+ breast cancer cell line MCF-7, beta-estradiol down regulated the expression of all four EGFR family member receptors as determined by RT-PCR.', 'In contrast, the ER antagonist 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4HT) inhibited the downregulation induced by beta-estradiol [81].', 'Gatekeeper Mutations in HER2.', 'The T798M mutation in HER2 is considered a gatekeeper mutation as it affects the ability of small molecule inhibitors such as lapatinib to bind the ATPbinding pocket and the mutation confers resistance to the inhibitor [82].', 'In studies by a different research group which were aimed at determining the mechanism of resistance of breast cancer cells containing the HER2 T798M mutation to lapatinib, it was shown that the cells overexpressed EGFR ligands [83].', 'In BT474 and MCF10A breast cancer cells transfected with the construct encoding HER2-T798M mutation, elevated HER2 kinase activity was detected and lapatinib did not block phosphorylation of HER2, EGFR3 or downstream Akt and ERK1 2.', 'Increased levels of EGFR2 associated with PI3Kp85 were detected in the transfected cells and the BT474 HER2T798M cells were also resistant to Herceptin.', 'However these cells were sensitive to the pan-phosphoinositol-3kinase (PI3K) inhibitors BKM120 and XL147 but not the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase1 2 (MEK1 2) inhibitor CI-1040.', 'The BT474 HER2-T798M transfected cells expressed elevated levels of the EGFR ligands EGF, TGF-alpha, amphiregulin (AR), and heparin binding EGF (HB-EGF).', 'Thus targeting breast cancers with both HER2 inhibitors and PI3K inhibitors may be an appropriate technique to treat those breast cancer patients with HER2T798M mutations [84].', 'Other growth factors also bind the EGFR family of receptors including: EGF, schwannomaderived growth factor (SDGF), vaccinia growth factor (VGF), Neu differentiation factor (NDF) or neuregulins, Oncotarget  \\x0cand heregulin.', 'A diagram of EGFR family members is presented in Figure 1.', 'Mutations at the EGFR Gene Family in Breast Cancer.', 'HER2 is amplified in 20-25% of breast cancers.', 'However, the roles of mutations amplifications of other EGFR family members are not so clear.', 'A diagram illustrating some of the effects of mutations amplifications in EGFR1 HER2 and other genes in breast and other cancers on signal transduction pathways is presented in Figure 2.', 'The presence of EGFR1 or HER2 gene amplification or overexpression was investigated in a series of metaplastic breast carcinomas (MBC) [89].', 'MBC are basal like tumors that account for less than 1% of all invasive mammary carcinomas.', 'Nineteen of the 25 (76%) MBC examined overexpressed EGFR1.', 'In contrast, only one case exhibited HER2 overexpression but HER2 gene amplification was not detected in this study of MBC.', 'In a subsequent study by the same group, the presence of EGFR1 amplification and activating mutations was examined in 47 MBC [90].', 'Within the subset that had EGFR overexpression, 34% had EGFR1 gene amplification.', 'This group examined these MBC samples for the presence of activating mutations in exons 18, 19, 20, and 21 of the EGFR1 gene.', 'No activating mutations of EGFR1 in exons 18, 19, 20 and 21 were detected in these MBC patient samples.', '4608 Oncotarget  Roles of Aberrant mRNA Splicing in Sensitivity to Herceptin.', 'This missplicing results in resistance to Herceptin.', 'In contrast, retention of intron 8 of the HER2 gene after mRNA splicing results in the creation of herstatin which inhibits tumor cell proliferation.', 'Likewise retention of intron 15 during splicing of HER2 results in the p100 protein which also suppresses tumor cell proliferation [85].', 'Conserved domains of the four different EGFR family members are indicated by similar shading.', 'HER2 does not bind a ligand.', 'Epidermal growth factor (EGF), vaccinia growth factor (VGF), amphiregulin (AR), heparin binding-EGF (HB-EGF), schwannoma-derived growth

'www.impactjournals.com oncotarget  \\x0cIntroduction of a construct encoding EGFRvIII into MCF-7 breast cancer cells resulted in HER2 phosphorylation, which the authors suggested occurred through heterodimerization and cross-talk [91].', 'Thus there was co-expression of EGFRvIII and EGFR WT in some human invasive breast cancer tissue but not in normal breast samples.', 'It must be pointed out that other studies consisting of 55 breast cancer cell lines and 170 primary breast cancer did not observe similar results and the authors concluded that expression of EGFRvIII is extremely rare in breast cancer [93].', 'Interesting in the low risk, early stage patients, EGFRvIII expression was associated with ER- or HER2+.', '48% of the patients displayed EGFR1, 54% of the patients were positive for phospho-EGFR, and 4% of the patients were positive for EGFRvIII.', 'EGFR1 expression correlated with negative hormone receptor status, worse relapse-free survival and overall survival than those patients with did not express detectable EGFR1 [95].', 'This study indicated that prognostic value of EGFR1 expression was most important in the HER2+ and the ER-  PR- subgroups.', 'These tumors are ER+ but are characterized as having an aggressive behavior which is 4HT resistant.', 'This subset of breast cancers displays increased EGFR1, HER2 and downstream PI3K PTEN Akt mTORC1 pathway activation [96,97].', 'www.impactjournals.com oncotarget 4609  EGFRvIII interacts with HER2 [98] and chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) [99,100] to activate signaling pathways important in migration, invasion and tumorigenesis.', 'These interactions between EGFRvIII and HER2 and CXCR4 may be prolonged in comparison to interactions between EGFR1 and HER2 and CXCR4 as it is more difficult to down regulate the constitutive nature of EGFRvIII.', 'HER2 normally has to heterodimerize with another EGFR family member for activity.', 'However, if the HER2 gene is amplified, HER2 activity is induced and the abnormal breast tumor growth is dependent on HER2 activity for growth [104].', 'An activating mutation has been detected in HER2+ lung cancer patients in the germline from a Japanese cancer patient with a familiar history of lung cancer as well as sporadic cancer patients [105].', 'This mutation activated downstream HER2 signaling molecules including Akt and p38MAPK.', 'Somatic mutations in the kinase domain of the HER2 gene, which result in its activation have been detected in lung cancer patients [106].', 'In a study involving non small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), HER2 mutations were detected in 1.6% (11 of 671) of NSCLC cancer specimens examined but were absent in other types of cancers.', 'The HER2 mutations were in-frame insertions in exon 20 corresponding to a similar region as in the EGFR gene where insertions were detected in NSCLC patients.', 'Interestingly the HER2 mutations were more frequent in the lung cancer patients that never smoked.', 'HER2 mutations were detected more frequently in patients of Oriental ethnicity than other ethnicities.', 'Recently mutations in HER2 have been detected in breast cancer patient samples which lack HER2 gene amplification.', 'Thirteen HER2 mutations were characterized from twenty-five patient samples which had HER2 mutations but lacked HER2 gene amplification.', 'Some mutations (L755S) resulted in lapatinib resistance; however this was not an activating mutation.', 'All of the cells containing the HER2 mutations were sensitive to the irreversible HER2 kinase inhibitor, neratinib [107].', 'Loss of HER2 activity also results in loss of phosphorylated EGFR3.', 'It has been shown that HER2 Oncotarget  \\x0ccan dimerize with EGFR3 to drive breast cancer proliferation [104].', 'Loss of EGFR3 activity in HER2+ breast cancer cells inhibited their growth.', 'This growth inhibition mediated by loss of HER2 or EGFR3 and could be overcome by introduction of a construct encoding activated Akt.', 'Importantly this group demonstrated that a key function of EGFR3 was to couple the response of HER2 to the PI3K PTEN Akt mTORC pathway.', 'However it interacts with the EGFR family members and serves to transduce signals to the PI3K PTEN Akt  mTORC1 pathway.', 'However, it is still important and it can serve in pathways responsible for drug resistance [109].', 'Ligand binding to EGFR4 stimulates either homodimerization or heterodimerization of EGFR4 with another EGFR family member.', 'The EGFR4 Q646C mutant results in an EGFR4 protein which undergoes ligand-independent homodimerization and tyrosine phosphorylation which interestingly suppresses colony formation of breast, pancreatic and prostate cell lines [110, 119-121].', 'Introduction of the constitutively active EGFR4 I658Q mutant into breast, ovarian and prostate cell lines induces apoptosis [122].', 'However, in some cell types and biological situations EGFR4 has oncogenic activities [120].', 'Furthermore, overexpression of HER2, EGFR4, and the EGFR4 ligand NRG1-beta in medulloblastoma results in increased metastasis [124].', 'Likewise over-expression of EGFR4 in conjunction with EGFR1 and HER2 results in breast cancers correlates with poor prognosis [125].', 'Silencing endogenous EGFR4 expression in ER+ MCF7 and T47D breast tumor cell lines reduces anchorage-independent proliferation stimulated by an EGFR4 ligand such as neuregulin-2beta [110, 126].', 'HER2 tyrosine kinase activity, rather than EGFR4 tyrosine kinase activity was required for neuregulin-2beta to stimulate cell proliferation [110].', 'Interesting the sites of EGFR4 tyrosine phosphorylation, but not the sites of HER2 phosphorylation, were required for neuregulin2beta to regulate cell proliferation [110].', 'Thus the roles of EGFR4 in cancer remain complex and are influenced by the expression of other EGFR family members.', 'Neurofibromin 1 (NF1) is a tumor suppressor gene.', 'The tumor suppressor NF1 has been implicated in sporadic breast cancer.', 'Recent studies have suggested that NF1 is a breast cancer driver gene.', 'NF1 is deleted or mutated in 27.7% of all breast carcinomas [127].', 'In a study of inbred Chaos3 mice, investigators noted high levels of genetic instability which can lead to mammary tumors.', 'The genomically-characterized mammary adenocarcinomas from these mice displayed deletions of certain genes, and the NF1 gene was deleted in the vast majority of the mouse mammary adenocarcinomas.', 'These mammary adenocarcinomas exhibited constitutive Ras hyperactivation and sensitivity to Ras pathway inhibitors.', 'Also alternative mRNA splicing events can give rise to different NF1 isoforms.', 'NF1 and Ras expression were examined in 22 sporadic breast cancers, 18 benign lesions and 6 normal breast tissues by tissue microarrays.', 'NF1 and CELF3-6 RNA expression was examined by RT-PCR in the breast samples.', 'NF1 and Ras expression displayed

to therapy resistance.', 'ROS can induce the calcium calmodulin kinase (CaM-K) cascade which can induce Ras which can subsequently activate both the Raf MEK ERK and PI3K  PTEN Akt mTOR cascades (most components of the two cascades which promote signaling are show in green ovals, transcription factors activated by events are shown in yellow diamonds, transcription factors inactivated by events shown in black diamonds).', 'Induction of the Ras Raf MEK ERK and PI3K PTEN Akt mTOR pathways can result in the activation of many survival pathways, and regulate both cell cycle progression as well as protein translation.', 'Some of the phosphorylation events mediated by Akt actually serve to inhibit the activities of key proteins such as the Foxo transcription factors and the murine double minute (MDM2) ubiquitin ligase (depicted in black ovals).', 'MDM2 serves to regulate p53 protein stability by ubiquitination, however when it is phosphorylated by Akt it is inactivated.', 'Moreover chemotherapeutic drugs and radiotherapy can induce the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein shown in a black oval, which can in turn phosphorylate and regulate p53.', 'p53 can have complex positive and negative effects on cell growth (depicted in yellow diamond), it can regulate the expression of p21 cyclin dependent kinase inhibitory protein-1 (p21Cip1) which controls cell cycle progression.', 'p53 can also control the transcription of genes such as Puma, Noxa and Bax which are involved in apoptosis (all of these molecules are shown in black ovals, as they tend to inhibit cell cycle progression or promote apoptosis).', 'Both Akt and ERK can phosphorylate p21Cip1 which alters its activity and ability to inhibit cell growth (shown as black phosphorylation sites) and subsequently influence cell growth and therapy resistance.', 'p27Kip1 can also be phosphorylated by both Akt and ERK, however the effects of these phosphorylation events are unclear.', 'Akt phosphorylation of p27Kip1 may result in its cytoplasmic localization, while ERK phosphorylation of p27Kip1 may result in elevated levels of the protein.', 'Hence phosphorylation of proteins by ERK and Akt can have dramatic effects on cell proliferation and contribute to the therapy resistance.', 'In the presence of functional BRCA1 and BRCA2 (indicated in yellow ovals) these breaks may be repaired and normal gene transcription can occur.', 'However when BRCA1 or BRCA2 are mutated, the repair of these genes may not occur and proper gene transcription might not occur.', 'This figure serves as an introduction as to how activation of these pathways by chemotherapy and radiotherapy may contribute to therapeutic resistance.', 'www.impactjournals.com oncotarget 4631 Oncotarget

correlation between ERa and SIRT1 expressions (Fig.', 'ERa-positive tumors and cancer cell lines expressed high levels of SIRT1 than ERa-negative tumors and cancer cell lines.', 'Similarly, both ERa and SIRT1 proteins are overexpressed in breast tumor tissues compared with normal mammary tissues (Supplementary Fig.', 'To confirm this positive association further, we treated ZR75.1 cells with E2 in the presence and absence of antiestrogens and monitored the expression levels of SIRT1.', 'E2 significantly induced SIRT1 expression, and the effect was markedly blunted in the presence of antiestrogens (Fig.', 'Similarly, when ZR75.1 cells were passaged several times in estrogen-free culture medium, ERa disappeared in these cells as did SIRT1 at passage numbers greater than 10 (Fig.', 'These data showed that ligandoccupied ERa induces SIRT1 expression in mammary epithelial cells.', 'This was supported further by the findings that SIRT1 levels were higher in various tissues in female mice than in male mice (Supplementary Fig.', 'SIRT1 expression also correlated positively with E2 in various stages of mammary gland development (data not shown).', 'All these results suggest

'In these cells, both SIRT1 and ERa were colocalized in the nucleus (Fig.', 'This interaction and nuclear colocalization was also confirmed in ERa-negative cells (MCF10A and MB231) following ectopic expression of ERa (Fig.', 'There are 2 estrogen receptors, ERa and ERb, and 3 estrogen receptor-related proteins, ERRa, ERRb, and ERRg ; all these proteins share significant sequence homology (26).', 'Therefore, we examined the interaction of SIRT1 with both ERs and ERRs in ZR75.1 cells that endogenously express all these proteins.', 'These studies showed that SIRT1 interacts not only with ERa but also with ERRa (Supplementary Fig.', 'This was further confirmed in MCF7 cells and in 2 ER-negative human mammary epithelial cell lines, HMEC and HBL100 (data not shown).', 'To test whether ERa specifically interacts with SIRT1 or also with other sirtuins, we expressed Flag-tagged SIRT1-7 in ZR75.1 cells, and examined the presence of ERa in immunoprecipitates with  an anti-Flag antibody.', 'The interaction was evident only with SIRT1 (Supplementary Fig.', 'ERa ligands and catalytically active SIRT1 are required for the interaction between ERa and SIRT1 In the classical mechanism, E2 binds to ERa and the resultant complex interacts with the estrogen-response elements in E2 target genes, consequently promoting their transcription.', 'To examine whether the interaction between ERa and SIRT1 requires E2 and whether functional disruption of E2 ERa complex with antiestrogens affects the interaction, we cultured ZR75.1 cells in E2-free medium and then treated the cells with E2 and antiestrogens.', 'IP experiments using these cell lysates showed that SIRT1-ERa interaction requires E2 and that functional disruption of E2 ERa complex dramatically reduces the interaction (Fig.', 'Similarly, inhibition of the catalytic activity of SIRT1 with SIRT1 inhibitors also disrupted the interaction (Fig.', 'In contrast, inhibition of type I and type II histone deacetylase (HDAC) did not affect the interaction between ERa and SIRT1.', 'This suggests that active ERa and catalytically active SIRT1 are required for the interaction.', 'Furthermore, the requirement of a catalytically active SIRT1 suggests that the interaction between ERa and SIRT1 may be regulated by SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of ERa.', 'Therefore, we examined the acetylation status of ERa in the presence (SIRT1

(ERa-negative cells with endogenous SIRT1) and monitored the protein expression and acetylation status of ERa (Fig.', 'Silencing of SIRT1 did not change either the expression or the acetylation status
