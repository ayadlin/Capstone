BACKGROUND: Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVL) is characterized by lymphoma cell proliferation in the
lumina of small vessels in various organs. A high incidence of neurologic symptoms associated with the central nervous system has been reported, but peripheral nerve involvement (neurolymphomatosis [NL]) rarely has been
described. METHODS: The medical records from patients who were diagnosed with IVL over the past 4 years were
reviewed. A diagnosis of NL was made based on the combination of neurologic symptoms and their correspondence
with imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), and/or the histologic confirmation of lymphoma cells within the
peripheral nerves, nerve root/plexuses, or cranial nerves. RESULTS: Four patients with NL were identified among 11
patients who had IVL. All cases of NL occurred as relapsed disease during or shortly after the completion of chemotherapy. Although MRI studies of the brains and whole spines revealed nerve infiltration by gadolinium enhancement
in 2 patients, the technology was not sensitive enough to detect such infiltration in the remaining 2 patients. In contrast, FDG-PET/CT studies successfully revealed cranial or peripheral nerve lesions in all 4 patients and was useful for
evaluating therapeutic response. Patients received treatment with high-dose methotrexate with or without other systemic chemotherapy, which achieved varied success. Further studies will be needed to determine the optimal treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the rarity of IVL and NL, the current observations suggested that IVL may have a
predilection not only for the vessels but also for both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Cancer

Intravascular lymphoma (IVL) is a rare type of extranodal, large B-cell lymphoma that is characterized by the pref-

erential proliferation of neoplastic cells in the lumina of small vessels with no tendency to form tumors.1,2 The variety of
nonspecific clinical symptoms, including pyrexia, neurologic abnormalities, respiratory distress, and lack of lymphadenopathy, makes it difficult to diagnose lymphomas.3-5 However, recent recognition of the disease and the introduction of
various diagnostic modalities, including random skin biopsy,6,7 and 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) (PET/CT)8,9 have facilitated the in vivo diagnosis of IVL and
prompt initiation of chemotherapy. The use of rituximab in combination with standard cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CHOP)10 has resulted in a marked improvement in the survival rate of patients with
IVL.11

Neurolymphomatosis in IVLR2/Matsue et al

Neurolymphomatosis (NL) also is a rare manifestation of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in which lymphoma
cells infiltrate the peripheral nerves.12,13 NL is characterized clinically by a painful polyneuropathy or polyradiculopathy, cranial neuropathy, painless polyneuropathy, and
peripheral mononeuropathy. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of NL often is difficult and requires histologic confirmation of the affected nerve, which may not be feasible
and often is nondiagnostic.12,14 Enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful in diagnosing NL before
histopathologic confirmation by revealing the enlargement and enhancement of the affected nerve, although it
may not always provide optimal visualization of lymphomatous involvement.12,15 Several recent studies have
demonstrated the advantages of FDG-PET/CT in the diagnosis of NL.13,16-20
The clinical characteristics of IVL are extremely variable; however, a high incidence of neurologic symptoms
associated with central nervous system (CNS) involvement has been reported,3,21 although peripheral nerve
involvement in IVL rarely has been described. Here, we
report 4 patients with IVL who had cranial and/or peripheral neuropathy as a manifestation of recurrent IVL.
Imaging studies, including MRI and FDG-PET/CT, and
neurologic findings supported the diagnosis of NL in
these patients. The current observations suggest that IVL
may have a predilection not only for the vessels but also
for both the CNS and the peripheral nervous system.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We reviewed the medical records of patients who were
diagnosed with IVL over the past 4 years at Kameda
General Hospital, Kamogawa-shi, Japan. There were 11
patients with pathologically confirmed IVL. Nine of those
11 patients were diagnosed with IVL by random skin biopsy, and the remaining 2 patients were diagnosed by
bone marrow biopsy alone6,7 with immunohistochemistry. Diagnoses of IVL were made by an expert hematopathologist in accordance with the latest World Health
Organization classification.1,2 Upon admission, all
patients were examined by imaging modalities, including
whole-body CT and/or brain MRI and FDG-PET/CT, as
the initial evaluation of IVL in addition to routine
laboratory examinations. The diagnosis of NL required 1)
clinical symptoms and neurologic findings related to
peripheral neuropathy of the cranial or spinal nerves; and
either 2) CT/MRI-based demonstration of enhancement
and/or enlargement of peripheral nerve(s) or nerve roots
that also revealed accumulation of FDG by FDG-PET/

Case Reports
Patient 1

A man aged 74 years was admitted to our hospital
because of progressive dyspnea and unexplained fever.
Laboratory data were unremarkable except for the presence of elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
(1166 IU/L; normal level, 119-229 IU/L) and mild
thrombocytopenia (107  103/mm3). Chest radiograms
revealed ground-glass opacities in both lung fields. A histologic diagnosis of IVL was made on the basis of a random skin biopsy and a lung biopsy. The patient was
treated with R-CHOP and had rapid improvement of
clinical symptoms; however, after 3 courses of RCHOP, the patient developed progressive paresthesia
with pain in the upper and lower extremities, predominantly in the left leg. Neurologic examination indicated
the absence of tendon reflexes in the extremities and
glove-and-stocking type motor and sensory disturbances.
An examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed
slight pleocytosis (24/mm3) but was inconclusive for
lymphoma cell invasion. The findings on brain and
whole-spine MRI studies also were inconclusive.
Although FDG-PET/CT revealed hypermetabolic
lesions in the left iliopsoas and brachial plexus of both
arms (Fig. 1a), NL was not diagnosed at that time;
instead, a diagnosis of vincristine-induced peripheral
neuropathy was considered. Subsequently, CSF became
positive for cytology. The patient was treated with a
high-dose of methotrexate (MTX) (1.5 g/m2) combined
with weekly intrathecal MTX injections, which resulted
in a brief improvement of neurologic symptoms. However, the patient developed renal failure and pneumonia,
and his neurologic symptoms deteriorated during the
treatment of these complications. The patient and his
family refused further treatment. The patient died of
aspiration pneumonia 4 months after the onset of neurologic symptoms. An autopsy revealed disseminated lymphomatous lesions involving the perineurium of the
cauda equina, muscles, subcutaneous lesions, bone marrow, liver, adrenal gland, and testis, although no lymphomatous involvement was observed in the cerebral
parenchyma. Unfortunately, the autopsy did not focus
on the peripheral nerves, such as the brachial plexus or
the lumbar plexus, and only the cauda equina was examined. Figure 1b reveals the cauda equina, where the

phosphoprotein expressed on the surface of all mature Bcells). The loss of CD20 may have been caused by
rituximab.
Patient 2

A woman aged 64 years who previously was in good
health was referred to our hospital with a fever, consciousness disturbance, and elevated LDH (1210 IU/L). She
had anemia (hemoglobin 7.9 g/dL), thrombocytopenia
(34  109/mm3), and marked elevation of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL2R) (24,900 U/mL; normal level,
230-620 U/mL). A diagnosis of IVL was made on the ba-

4514

sis of a random skin biopsy. R-CHOP chemotherapy was
initiated with prompt recovery of hematologic and neurologic findings. The patient achieved complete remission
(CR) and was discharged with full recovery of neurologic
abnormalities after 8 courses of R-CHOP. Soon after discharge, the patient developed weakness and burning pain
in her lower legs. Neurologic examination revealed peripheral neuropathy with a glove-and-stocking distribution. Laboratory data, including results from a bone
marrow biopsy, did not support the recurrence of lymphoma. CSF was negative for malignant cells. Although
the results of both brain and whole-spine MRI and FDGPET/CT were negative for the recurrence of a lymphoma,
clinical signs and symptoms strongly suggested NL of the
sciatic nerve in this case. The patient received 8 cycles of
high-dose MTX (2.5 g/m2) every 2 weeks. This resulted
in a gradual improvement of her neurologic symptoms.

She then underwent autologous peripheral blood transplantation with high-dose cyclophosphamide (120 mg/

CR and was able to walk with the assistance of a frame for
3 years after the completion of treatment. A retrospective
reassessment of the FDG-PET/CT studies at the onset of
her neurologic symptoms revealed a linear uptake of FDG
along both sciatic nerves corresponding to her clinical
symptoms, which disappeared after treatment (Fig. 2a,b).

transient improvement of clinical symptoms and imaging
findings, she again developed right peroneal nerve palsy.
Repeat FDG-PET/CT examination revealed intense
uptake in the right peroneal nerve, but not in the trigeminal nerve. Subsequent CSF analysis was positive for cytology. Currently, she is being treated with irradiation (30
grays [Gy]) of the right peroneal nerve and intrathecal
MTX infusion.

Patient 3

Patient 4

A woman aged 74 years was admitted to our hospital
because of unexplained fever, hypoxia, splenomegaly, and
elevation of serum LDH (2620 IU/L). A diagnosis of IVL
was made based on a bone marrow biopsy. She achieved
CR and was discharged after 6 cycles of R-CHOP followed by 1 course of high-dose MTX (3.5 g/m2) as prophylaxis to prevent CNS relapse. She was readmitted 1.5
months after discharge because of left facial hypoesthesia
with pain, which was followed by right lower leg paralysis
over the next few days. Neurologic examination revealed
mononeuropathy multiplex of the left trigeminal nerve
and the right deep peroneal nerve. The results of hematologic examinations, including complete blood count,
bone marrow smear, and blood chemistry, all were within
the respective normal limits. The findings of CSF examination were unremarkable. An axial, T1-weighted brain
MRI revealed gadolinium enhancement of the thickened
left trigeminal nerve (Fig. 3a). An FDG-PET/CT study
revealed increased 18F-FDG uptake in the left Gasserian
ganglion of the trigeminal nerve (Fig. 3b, center of the
crossed red lines) and the right peroneal nerve (Fig. 3c,d),
which corresponded to the clinical symptoms of NL. The
patient responded well to salvage chemotherapy with ifosfamide, etoposide, cytarabine, and high-dose MTX22 fol-

A woman aged 84 years was referred to our hospital
with unexplained fever, confusion, progressive worsening
of renal function, and deterioration of her general condition. On examination, she had pancytopenia with a hemoglobin level of 6.5 g/dL, a white blood cell count of
1700/mm3, and a platelet count of 28,000/mm3. Blood
chemistry revealed marked elevation of LDH (1112 IU/
L) and sIL2R (19,558 U/mL). A whole-body CT scan
revealed pleural effusion, an adrenal mass, and mild
splenomegaly. No peripheral or central lymphadenopathy
was noted. A diagnosis of IVL was made by random skin
biopsy. The patient received 7 cycles of a 50% to 80%
dose of R-CHOP chemotherapy every 3 weeks and was
discharged 5 months after admission in CR. However, she
was readmitted because of weakness of the left lower leg 2
weeks after discharge. Neurologic examination revealed
peripheral nerve impairment from the third lumbar segment to the first sacral segment. The results of a laboratory
examination were unremarkable. An FDG-PET/CT
study revealed intense uptake of FDG in the left lumbar
plexus (Fig. 4b), which had not been observed at the time
of discharge (Fig. 4c). Thin-slice coronal MRI images of
the lumbar plexus revealed gadolinium enhancement of
the enlarged sciatic nerve (Fig. 4a), which confirmed the

presence of lymphomatous infiltration. Examination of
CSF revealed a slight increase in protein and positive cytology. She was treated with high-dose MTX (2.0 g/m2)
and weekly intrathecal MTX injection without benefit.
Therefore, she received irradiation of the left lumbosacral
lesion and had partial improvement. After irradiation, the
accumulation of FDG in the left lumbar plexus disappeared completely (Fig. 4c).

RESULTS
The clinical characteristics of the 4 patients with NL are
provided in Table 1. All NL developed as recurrent disease
during or shortly after R-CHOP chemotherapy. LDH
and sIL2R levels, both of which are sensitive tumor
markers for IVL, did not change remarkably when NL
occurred. CSF analyses revealed mild to moderate
increases in both cell count (>5 cells/mm3) and protein
concentrations in all 4 patients. Although only 1 patient
(Patient 4) had positive cytology when NL occurred, subsequent CSF analysis detected leptomeningeal spread in
an additional 2 patients (Patients 1 and 3).
The results of MRI and FDG-PET/CT studies in 4
patients with NL are provided in Figures 1 through 4 and
are summarized in Table 2. Peripheral nerve palsies of the
lower extremities were common in these patients. All
patients exhibited peripheral nerve neuropathy corresponding to the affected nerve or nerve root, as deterCancer

mined by FDG-PET/CT studies. Routine whole-spine
MRI in Patients 1 and 2 failed to detect NL lesions even
after FDG-PET/CT. In contrast, we successfully discovered NL lesion by thin-sliced coronal imaging in Patients
3 and 4 after detecting suspected NL lesions by FDGPET/CT. FDG-PET/CT studies indicated that NL
lesions disappeared or reappeared in response to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. There were no significant
differences between the patients with and without NL
with regard to age, sex, clinical presentation, laboratory
data (including anemia, thrombocytopenia, serum LDH,
and sIL2R), the presence or absence of hemophagocytic
histiocytosis, positivity of random skin biopsy, or CNS recurrence during the course of disease; although positivity
for CD5 tended to be related to the development of NL
(Table 3), this correlation was not statistically significant.
However, it should be noted that a comparison of the 2
groups of patients who had IVL with or without NL was
of limited value because of the small number of patients.

DISCUSSION
IVL represents an aggressive lymphoma with a rapid progression and a high incidence of systemic dissemination.
Among the involved organs, it has been demonstrated
that IVL has a predilection for CNS involvement at either
presentation or relapse; however, neurologic manifestations of IVL are extremely heterogeneous and can include

sensory and motor deficits as well as altered consciousness.
Neuroimaging findings vary widely and range from the
diffuse involvement of the deep white matter to infarctlike lesions,23 reflecting the heterogeneity of CNS involvement in terms of true lymphoma infiltration and vascular
occlusion. In addition, many patients with IVL have a
deteriorated performance status at diagnosis, and the diagnosis of CNS involvement often may be made by observing symptoms alone. Therefore, despite the frequency of
CNS involvement in previous studies, there may be heterogeneity in CNS involvement within patients who have
IVL. In addition, previous studies have not addressed peripheral nerve involvement in patients with IVL,3,4,21
although some case reports have described peripheral
nerve involvement.24-27
NL is a rare clinical entity that has been described
primarily in case reports and small case series. Given the
extreme rarity of both IVL and NL, the current study
highlights the high incidence of NL in patients with IVL.
The diagnosis of NL often is delayed or is not made at all
because of a lack of familiarity with the disease. In addition, NL mimics many other conditions; the diagnosis

4518

requires the exclusion of other causes of neuropathy and
positive imaging findings to detect neural involvement. If
the diagnosis remains in doubt, then histologic confirmation of the affected structure is necessary; otherwise,
autopsy findings may be required to make the final diagnosis.13 The diagnoses of NL in our patients were made
based on neurologic symptoms and identification of the
corresponding lesion(s) on imaging studies, including
MRI and FDG-PET/CT. Pathologic findings were
obtained in Patient 1, who had nerve fascicles surrounded
by tumor cell infiltrates. Intravascular lymphoma lesions
were not observed in the cauda equina but were observed
in other organs. There have been several reports indicating
direct lymphoma cell infiltration within the nerve fascicles
in patients with NL. Therefore, the pattern of lymphoma
cell infiltration may vary between patients.12,28 These differences may have implications regarding the clinical features and treatment responses in these patients.
The MRI radiographic characteristics of NL include
nerve enlargement and enhancement, which were
observed best on contrast-enhanced, thin-slice, T1weighted coronal images of the spine.12,29,30 However,

Cancer

Neurolymphomatosis in IVLR2/Matsue et al

MRI may not be a reliable and sensitive diagnostic
method, because NL lesions have a patchy distribution in
long peripheral nerves. In our series, routine whole-spine
MRI studies with 1.0-cm slice images failed to detect NL
lesions in Patients 1 and 2, but 0.5-cm, thin-slice images
detected nerve enlargement in Patients 3 and 4. In contrast, FDG-PET/CT studies detected NL lesions in all 4
patients and appeared to be more sensitive for the identification of NL, as reported previously.13 FDG-PET/CT
studies also provided information on the distribution of
the affected area(s) and treatment responses, as indicated
by nodular lymphomas. Despite the usefulness of FDGPET/CT studies in the diagnosis of NL, the number of
reported cases diagnosed by FDG-PET/CT remains
small, and a positive FDG-PET/CT study does not specifically suggest invasion of the lymphoma. The nonspecific
accumulation of FDG in muscles, adjunct soft tissue, and
vessels may mimic positivity. Biopsies of the affected
nerve(s) may be necessary for the definite diagnosis of NL,
but permanent defects in biopsied nerves and false-negative results often prevent this approach in the clinical setting. The concordance between neurologic findings and
MRI and/or FDG-PET/CT findings could indicate a diagnosis of NL, as suggested by Baehring et al12 and Grisariu et al.13 In the current series, MRI was useful for
confirming the FDG-PET/CT findings of cranial neuropathy and/or neuropathy because of spinal cord involvement, although a dedicated method for the disclosure of
the affected nerve(s), such as using thin-slice coronal
images and gadolinium enhancement, was necessary for
the diagnosis of NL. In addition to the imaging studies
and clinical symptoms, a high index of suspicion and familiarity with the clinical manifestations of NL are needed
to ensure its early diagnosis.
Positive CSF cytology was observed in only 1 of the
4 patients when NL occurred, although almost all patients
had variable increases in protein concentrations and
exhibited slight CSF pleocytosis. These findings were consistent with previous studies indicating that many of
patients with NL have negative CSF cytology at presentation.12 However, the use of multiparameter flow cytometry in addition to conventional cytology will improve the
identification of leptomeningeal disease in patients with
IVL, as reported recently in patients with aggressive nonHodgkin lymphoma.31,32
The most striking feature of recurrent NL is its timing. It is noteworthy that all 4 of our patients developed
NL during or shortly they completed chemotherapy. It is
possible that these patients had subclinical NL lesions at

Cancer

diagnosis although they had no clinical symptoms. Similar observations have been made in patients with CNS
relapse of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma.33,34
Recently, Gan et al35 reported 4 patients who had diffuse
large B-cell lymphomas that were complicated by the
presence of NL. It is noteworthy that all NL occurred as
recurrent disease during or shortly after those patients
completed chemotherapy, as observed in our patients.
These observations support the idea that chemotherapeutic agents, including rituximab, may not adequately penetrate the presumed blood-nerve barrier as well as the
blood-brain barrier.36
The multiple potential sites of involvement mean
that chemotherapy usually is treatment of choice in
patients with NL. Intravenous high-dose MTX, either
alone or in combination with other agents been used for
the treatment of NL.13 Various doses of MTX ranging
from 1.5 to 5.0 g/m2 with or without other systemic
chemotherapy were used in our patients, but severe renal
toxicity and pneumonia prevented further treatment in
Patient 1. In addition, high-dose MTX with intrathecal
MTX injection could not prevent or treat NL successfully,
as observed in Patients 3 and 4. These observations suggest that these treatments may be suboptimal or inadequate for NL, as also reported in patients with aggressive
B-cell lymphoma, in whom 5 of 9 patients who had flow
cytometry-positive CSF developed overt CNS disease
despite aggressive CNS-oriented treatment.34 Radiation
therapy was successful in Patients 3 and 4, who had highdose, MTX-resistant, peroneal, and lumbosacral involvement. These observations suggest that radiation therapy
with curative or palliative intent may be of value in
patients who have a high tumor burden or localized disease control.
In summary, we report 4 patients with IVL who
presented with NL, which developed either as an initial
manifestation or as recurrent disease. Their presenting
symptoms consisted of progressive peripheral and/or cranial neuropathy. Although brain MRI and whole-spine
MRI studies revealed nerve infiltration by demonstrating
enlargement and enhancement of the nerve or nerve root,
the sensitivity of this technology was limited by the patchy
distribution or small lesion size of NL. FDG-PET/CT
studies successfully revealed both cranial and peripheral
nerve involvement in all patients and allowed us to evaluate the distribution of involvement and the therapeutic
responses to chemotherapy. Considering the rarity of IVL
and NL, the current observations suggest that IVL may
have a predilection not only for the vessels but also for

both the CNS and the peripheral nervous system. Further
studies will be required to clarify the optimal dose and duration of treatment and to determine the long-term outcome of these patients.
