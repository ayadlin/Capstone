Neoadjuvant Combination Chemotherapy for Unresectable
Stage III Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer
Paul A. Bunn Jr, MD1; Laurie E. Gaspar, MD2; Michael J. Weyant, MD3; and John D. Mitchell, MD3

In this issue of Cancer, Ou and colleagues describe the results from a phase 2 trial of neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus bevacizumab delivered for 4 cycles in patients with “unresectable” stage III adenocarcinoma of the lung.1 The authors hypothesized that the addition of bevacizumab would increase response rates and thereby increase resectability rates and
subsequently improve survival. Their hypothesis was based on an assumption that the resectability rate in these patients
would be 40% with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy and would increase by 20% if the bevacizumab was efficacious.
The study was small (42 patients), included only a single arm, and had many nonstandard approaches. These nonstandard
approaches included the use of 4 cycles of chemotherapy (instead of 2 or 3 cycles), the use of prophylactic growth factors
(granulocyte-colony–stimulating factor), and the inclusion of N3 (supraclavicular) and bulky N2 disease. Details regarding the criteria used to determine whether a patient was deemed initially unresectable and what determined postchemotherapy/bevacizumab resectability are unfortunately not provided.
This study reported an objective response in 23 of 42 patients (55%) and a surgical resection rate of 74% including a
complete (R0) resection in 52% and an incomplete (R1) resection in 21%. The median event-free survival (EFS) was 15
months, and the 2-year EFS rate was about 35%. The median EFS was only 9 months in those who underwent R1 resection. The authors conclude that “neoadjuvant bevacizumab in combination with pemetrexed and carboplatin followed by
surgery is a feasible and safe treatment option for patients with unresectable stage III lung adenocarcinoma.”
The study is relatively well reported, but the median follow-up of just 14 months is quite short, and the data do not
yet justify the conclusion that such an experimental approach could be used on a routine basis. These patients have disease
that is potentially curable using concurrent chemoradiation, with a median survival in the range of 2 years in large cooperative group studies.2,3 Similar operability results with higher rates of lymph node response can be obtained using preoperative chemoradiation therapy.4
The results may justify further study with a larger randomized trial focusing on a single question, such as the role of
bevacizumab. However, considerable thought should be given to whether such a trial is warranted; and, if such a trial were
instituted, then the eligibility criteria should be well defined. Current chemotherapy regimens produce no complete pathologic responses, and it is likely that such responses would be necessary to have a major impact on cure rates. The addition
of bevacizumab to platinum doublet chemotherapy in advanced disease increased the response rate and prolonged
progression-free survival in randomized trials in the United States5 and in Europe.6 However, survival was prolonged only
in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 4599 trial, and that gain was modest. Furthermore, complete responses were
rare. Erlotinib alone provided a slight survival improvement in patients with advanced, refractory NSCLC; but response
rates were low, and there were no complete responses.7 In the adjuvant setting, results from recent, large, phase 3 randomized trials of erlotinib (RADIANT)8 and bevacizumab (E1505)9 combined with chemotherapy were reported. Both were
negative for any effect on survival. Thus, although both bevacizumab and erlotinib may prolong the survival of patients
with advanced NSCLC, neither prolonged survival in the adjuvant setting in those early stage adjuvant trials. Similarly,
bevacizumab failed to improved survival in adjuvant trials in other early stage cancers, even when there was some survival

prolongation in patients who had advanced disease.10,11
Certainly, the expense and toxicity of bevacizumab would
not justify its routine inclusion in the therapy for early
stage NSCLC unless a randomized trial could demonstrate a positive survival advantage.
The study by Ou et al raises some other important
issues. In their study, no preoperative radiation therapy
was included, although the patients often had T4 lesions
and bulky lymph node disease. There is some evidence
that radiotherapy may increase the rates of response and
complete response as well as survival in these settings.4
Thus, randomized trials should address the role of radiotherapy in this situation. Unfortunately, a large cooperative group study comparing chemotherapy versus
chemoradiation therapy before surgery for patients with
N2 disease had to close because of low accrual. Future
studies of preoperative chemoradiation with bevacizumab
will be problematic given the lack of safety data.12
Another difficult issue is whether incomplete resections
add value over chemoradiation alone. It is not clear that
these resections were beneficial in the study by Ou and
colleagues. Despite these issues, the authors report excellent surgical outcomes, with no surgical mortality even in
the 11 patients who underwent pneumonectomy, a group
that often is turned away from surgical resection. In addition, the patients who underwent R1 resection and
received postoperative radiation similarly seemed to tolerate it well.
Meta-analyses of randomized neoadjuvant trials
clearly indicate that there is a role for neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of stage III NSCLC,13 and evidence also suggests a role for radiation therapy combined
with chemotherapy.14 The role of surgery in bulky N2
disease is very controversial and a frequent topic of discussion at tumor boards around the country. Currently,
whether 4 cycles of chemotherapy are better than 2 or 3
cycles, whether bevacizumab adds to the value of chemotherapy, and whether incomplete resection and resection
of bulky N2 or N3 lymph nodes are of value are unproven
hypotheses.
In conclusion, the optimal approach to bimodality
and trimodality therapy for unresectable stage III lung
cancer remains undefined, and randomized trials addressing the issue of the best systemic therapy and the use of
chest radiotherapy and surgery are urgently needed.
