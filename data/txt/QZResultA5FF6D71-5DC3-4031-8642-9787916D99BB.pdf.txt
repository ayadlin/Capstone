Abstract
Cancer statistics show a disproportionately higher burden of
tumors in the old. Most of the studies evaluating vaccination
strategies have not taken into consideration the effect
that aging has on the immune system. For the first time, we
describe an animal tumor model in which self-tolerance and
aging are present at the same time. FVB-Her-2/neu mice which
are tolerant to neu antigens crossed with HLA-A2/Kb mice
(A2xneu) develop spontaneous tumors when they are more
than 22 months old. Analysis of CD8+ T-cell–specific responses
in A2xneu mice indicated that the priming activity of old
A2xneu mice to induce an immune response was diminished
compared with young animals. Following intratumoral injections of CpG-ODN, f30% of young A2xneu mice rejected the
tumor; however, no antitumor effect was observed in old
A2xneu mice. Analysis of T regulatory cells (Treg) indicated
that there are significantly more Tregs in old animals. After
CpG-ODN vaccination plus Treg depletion, 70% of young
A2xneu mice rejected the tumor. The same treatment
prolonged survival in old A2xneu mice, but none of the
animals rejected the tumor. Even though CpG-ODN injections
plus Treg depletion could rescue the antitumor responses
against self-tumor antigens in young tolerant mice, the same
therapy is not as effective in old tolerant hosts. Relevant
tumor models such as the A2xneu mice in which self-tolerance
and aging are present at the same time are critical to allow the
optimization of vaccination strategies to effectively stimulate
immune responses against self-tumor antigens in the young
and the old. [Cancer Res 2008;68(13):5423–31]

Introduction
There is statistical evidence indicating that the incidence of
cancer increases exponentially with advancing age (1, 2). The ageassociated increase in cancer may be due in part to a global
decrease in cell-mediated immunity (3, 4). Among the alterations
that diminish the immune function in aged individuals are
decreased proliferation of T cells (5), modifications in the
production and secretion of cytokines (6, 7), reduced cytotoxic
activity of CD8+ T-cells (8, 9), qualitative deficiency of B
lymphocytes with a reduced response to exogenous antigens (10),
and deficiencies in antigen-presenting cells (11, 12).
To understand the lack of immune responses against cancer and
to achieve tumor immunity, awareness of the concept of selfantigens versus non–self-antigens is critical (13). The principle of
the immune system is to tolerate self-antigens but develop vigorous

responses against foreign antigens (14). Therefore, to optimize a
vaccination strategy in order to stimulate an effective antitumor
immune response, it is essential to consider factors such as T-cell
tolerance (15) and expression of relevant tumor-associated
antigens (16, 17). Over the past 20 years, many groups have
described a multitude of immunotherapeutic strategies such as
increasing the immunogenicity of the tumor antigen or manipulation of the immune system to promote or enhance antitumor
responses. The majority of these studies have used young murine
models to test the efficacy of these strategies. However, very little
consideration has been paid to the effect that aging has on the
immune system and neither has the immunotherapeutic potential
of these strategies been investigated in elderly individuals.
Considering that the number of cancer cases are rising mainly
due to an increase in the elderly population, for any immune-based
cancer therapy to succeed, it is vital to take into account the agerelated changes in the activity of immune function.
The assessment of antitumor immune responses in animal
models is critical for evaluating the basic paradigms of tumor
immunology because these models provide all the immunecomponents which cannot be reproduced in vitro (18). We and
others have shown that the immune system of the old could be
manipulated and exploited for the induction of antitumor
responses (19–23). However, these studies do not deal with the
effect of self-tolerance or evaluate whether old hosts are able to
generate antitumor responses against self-tumor antigens. For the
first time, these studies describe an aged tumor model in which
self-tolerance and tumor progression are present simultaneously.
For the past several years, we have used the A2.1/Kb transgenic
mice (24) to identify A2.1/Her-2/neu epitopes (25) or to evaluate
immune responses against self-antigens in tolerant hosts by
crossing the A2.1/Kb transgenic mice with the FVB-neu transgenic
mice (26). Our results show that A2xneu mice contain only a lowavidity repertoire to neu antigens indicating that the repertoire of
A2xneu mice is tolerant to neu antigens (26–28). One of the
consequences of crossing the FVB-neu mice with the A2.1/Kb mice
is that spontaneous tumors appear in these animals when they are
22 to 27 months old. It is not well understood why these mice have
a delay in the appearance of spontaneous tumors (29). Therefore,
the A2xneu mouse model provides a unique opportunity to
evaluate antitumor immune responses against a self-antigen in
which aging and tolerance are present at the same time. In these
studies, we compared the antitumor responses in young and old
A2xneu mice. Our results indicate that the priming activity of old
A2xneu and A2xFVB mice to induce a T-cell response is much
weaker when compared with young animals. Interestingly, we
observed that one of the effects of aging is that old A2xFVB mice
lost their ability to reject tumors, in contrast with young A2xFVB
mice which were able to reject N202.A2 tumors. Analysis of
antitumor responses after CpG-ODN vaccination indicated that
100% of old A2xFVB mice rejected the N202.A2 cells, however, only

f30% of young A2xneu mice rejected the tumor and no antitumor
effect was observed in old A2xneu mice. We also observed that
naı̈ve old A2xFVB or A2xneu mice have a higher number of Tregs
when compared with young A2xFVB or A2xneu mice. Depletion of
Tregs plus CpG-ODN vaccination induced a strong antitumor
response in which 75% of young A2xneu mice rejected the tumor.
In contrast, the same therapy could not restore the antitumor
responses in old A2xneu mice. These results indicate that there are
drastic differences between young and old tolerant and nontolerant
hosts in responding to adjuvant therapy. Taken together, these
results indicate that the development of relevant tumor models,
such as the A2xneu mice in which self-tolerance and aging are
present at the same time, are critical because these models will
allow for the optimization of vaccination strategies to effectively
stimulate tumor immune responses against self-tumor antigens in
the young and the old.

Materials and Methods
Mice. The FVB-neu transgenic mice (line 202) were commercially
obtained from The Jackson Laboratory and maintained homozygously. The
FVB mice were purchased from Harlan. The HLA-A2.1/Kb transgenic mice
were kindly provided by Dr. Linda Sherman, from the Scripps Research
Institute, La Jolla, CA. The FVB-neu and FVB mice were mated with the
HLA-A2.1/Kb mice to generate A2xneu and A2xFVB mice.
Cell lines. The N202.A2 cell line was established from a spontaneous
tumor from A2xneu mice (26). The T2-A2.1/Kb cell line was also provided
by Dr. Linda Sherman. All cell lines were maintained in complete RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mmol/L of L-glutamine, 5  10 5 m 2-ME,
and 50 Ag/mL of gentamicin.
Analysis of A2.1-neu restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses in
young and old mice. Young (2 months old) and old (18 months old)
A2xFVB and A2xneu mice were immunized with the A2.1/Her-2/neu-p369–
377 (KIFGSLAFL) or A2.1/Her-2/neu-p773–782 (VMAGVGSPYV) peptides
as previously described (25). Briefly, animals were immunized with a
mixture of 100 Ag of the peptide with 120 Ag of the helper peptide (30) that
induces a strong CD4 T-cell response in 100 AL of incomplete Freud’s
adjuvant. Ten days after immunization, animals were sacrificed and spleens
were removed. For stimulation of cultures, T cells (106 cells/well) were
incubated with autologous irradiated (3,000 rad) lipopolysaccharide spleen
blasts (2  105 cells/well) that were pulsed with the p369–377 or p773–782
peptides in 24-well plates. After 5 days, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) were
assayed for lytic activity. The T2-A2.1/Kb cells pulsed with the peptides
were incubated with 150 ACi of 51Cr sodium chromate for 1 h at 37jC. Cells
were washed thrice and resuspended in complete RPMI medium. For the
cytotoxic assay, 51Cr-labeled target cells (104) were incubated with varying
concentrations of effector cells in a final volume of 200 AL in U-bottomed
96-well microtiter plates. Supernatants were recovered after 6 h of
incubation. To evaluate whether CpG-ODN vaccination and Treg depletion
enhances the T-cell’s responses, animals received five daily s.c. injections of
30 Ag CpG-ODN (1826, 5¶-TCCATGACGTTCCTGACGTT-3¶) or control-ODN
(1982, 5¶-TCCAGGACTTCTCTCAGGTT-3¶) on days 2, 1, 0, 1, and 2 prior
and post–peptide vaccination. On day 0, mice were immunized with the
peptide, as described above, near the site of the CpG-ODN injections. To
deplete Tregs, animals were injected with anti-GITR i.p. twice a week prior
to peptide immunization (300 Ag/injection).
ELISPOT analysis. For ELISPOT analysis of CTLs from young and old
A2xFVB and A2xneu mice, we followed the same protocol as we previously
reported (28).
Analysis of CD4+ Foxp3+ Tregs. The numbers of Tregs in young and old
A2xFVB and A2xneu mice were determined by analysis of CD4+Foxp3+ in
the spleen and lymph nodes. Spleen and lymph nodes from young and old
animals were first surface-stained with anti-CD4 (FITC) monoclonal
antibodies (eBioscience). Intracellular Foxp3 (PE) staining was performed
using a commercially available kit (eBioscience) following the manufacturer’s protocol.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

In vivo tumor studies. Young and old A2xFVB and A2xneu mice were
injected s.c. with 106 N202.A2 cells and monitored for tumor growth. To
evaluate the effect of vaccination with CpG-ODN, young A2xneu mice and
old A2xneu and A2xFVB mice were implanted with 106 N202.A2 cells and
tumors, and allowed to grow for 10 days before treatment was initiated.
On day 10 after tumor challenge (tumor size f200 mm3), animals were
randomly divided into groups of five to eight mice. Animals received
intratumoral (i.t.) injections of CpG-ODN and control-ODN. For the
treatments, animals were injected thrice a week for 3 weeks in a final
volume of 50 AL/injection. Animals injected with control-ODN served as
controls. The 30 Ag/injection dose was found to be an optimum dose
because at higher doses, toxicity or side effects were observed (data not
shown; ref. 31). To deplete Tregs, animals were injected with anti-GITR i.p.
once a week for 3 weeks on days 9, 16, and 23 (300 Ag/injection). To assess
whether peptide vaccination in combination with CpG-ODN plus anti-GITR
results in a stronger antitumor response, young and old A2xneu mice were
implanted with 106 N202.A2 cells. On day 9, animals began treatment with
anti-GITR, and on day 10, they were immunized with a mixture p773, p369,
and helper peptide as described above plus i.t. injections of CpG-ODN.
Peptide immunization was repeated every 10 days for a total of three times.
Tumor volume was expressed as (minor diameter)2  major diameter / 2.
Statistical analysis was determined by Student’s t test. Survival analysis used
the Breslow modification of the Kaplan-Meier test.

Results
Analysis of tumor growth in young and old A2xneu and
A2xFVB mice. We have observed that one of the consequences of
crossing FVB-neu mice with A2.1/Kb transgenic mice (A2xneu) is
that there is a delay in the appearance of spontaneous tumors in
A2xneu mice. Typically, spontaneous tumors appear at an age of
45 to 52 weeks in old naı̈ve FVB-neu mice (Fig. 1A). However,
spontaneous tumors appear in A2xneu mice when they are 104 to
116 weeks old (Fig. 1A). We have previously shown that N202.A2
cells grow in A2xneu as a consequence of immune-tolerance, but
are rejected by young A2xFVB mice. In order to evaluate whether
aging has an effect on the immune system altering the immune
responses, we tested whether there was a difference between young
and old mice in rejecting the N202.A2 cells. Young and old A2xFVB
and A2xneu mice were implanted s.c. with 106 N202.A2 cells and
tumor growth was evaluated. As expected, young A2xFVB mice
rejected the tumor; however, tumors grew in old A2xFVB mice
(Fig. 1B). N202.A2 cells formed tumors in young and old A2xneu
mice, as anticipated (Fig. 1B).
Analysis of T-cell responses in young and old A2xneu and
A2xFVB mice. We previously identified two immunodominant
A2.1/Her-2-neu epitopes using the A2.1/Kb transgenic mice (25).
Additionally, we have shown that A2xneu mice only have lowaffinity T-cells against the p369–377 and p773–782 epitopes, and
that these animals do not respond with the same efficacy to
peptide vaccination as A2xFVB mice (26–28). We evaluated the
priming ability of young and old A2xneu and A2xFVB mice to
induce a CTL response after immunization with the p369–377 and
p773–782 peptides. Our results indicate that the CTL activity from
young A2xFVB or A2xneu mice was stronger when compared with
the CTL activity of A2xFVB or A2xneu old mice (Fig. 2).
Interestingly, the CTL from old A2xFVB mice (nontolerant) had a
similar cytotoxic activity as the CTL from young A2xneu mice
(tolerant). A very weak CTL activity was detected in old A2xneu
mice. No cytotoxic activity against T2-A2/Kb cells pulsed with an
irrelevant peptide (HLA-A2.1/HIV-POL; ref. 25) was observed,
indicating that recognition of the p369 and p773 peptides is
specific (Fig. 2B and C). Taken together, these results clearly

Effect of Aging in the Activation of Immune Responses

Figure 1. Analysis of spontaneous tumor appearance
and tumor growth in young and old mice. A, the
appearance of spontaneous tumor was evaluated in
FVB-neu and A2xFVB-neu mice. Ten animals were
included per group. B, to evaluate whether aging has an
effect on the immune system altering its ability to reject
tumor, young and old A2xFVB and A2xneu mice were
implanted s.c. with 106 N202.A2 cells. Points, mean of

showed that aging severely compromises the immune system and
that old A2xneu mice did not have the same capacity to prime a
T-cell response as young mice.
Evaluation of antitumor responses in young and A2xFVB
and A2xneu mice. We have recently shown that CpG-ODN, but
not other TLR-ligands, induce an immune response in old BALB/c
mice (31). Here, we evaluated the effect of i.t. injections of CpGODN in inducing an antitumor response in young A2xneu and old
A2xFVB and A2xneu mice. I.t. injections of CpG-ODN induced an
antitumor response resulting in tumor rejection in 100% of old
A2xFVB mice (Fig. 3A). Only f30% of young A2xneu mice treated
with i.t. injections of CpG-ODN rejected the tumor (Fig. 3A) and
those animals that did not reject the tumor significantly prolonged
the survival of the animals when compared with control groups. In
contrast, no tumor rejection was observed in old A2xneu mice and
only a subtle delay in survival was observed in CpG-ODN–treated
old A2xneu mice when compared with control groups (Fig. 3A).
These results indicate that there are drastic differences between
tolerant (A2xneu) and nontolerant (A2xFVB) young and old hosts
as to how they respond to adjuvant stimulation and activate an
immune response. Old A2xFVB mice that rejected the tumor after
CpG-ODN treatment established a protective memory response
capable of rejecting the tumor challenge (Fig. 3B). In contrast,

www.aacrjournals.org

young A2xneu mice that rejected the tumor after CpG-ODN
treatment failed to further reject the tumor when challenged
70 days later (Fig. 3B), indicating the incapacity of tolerant mice to
develop memory responses against self tumor antigens.
Analysis of Tregs in young and old hosts. There is extensive
evidence indicating that Tregs can control and/or suppress
primary and memory immune responses (32–34). Very little is
known about Tregs in old mice. We evaluated whether there were
differences in the number of CD4+Foxp3+ from spleens in young
and old naı̈ve A2xFVB and A2xneu mice. We observed that the
number of Tregs in spleens from naı̈ve old A2xFVB and A2xneu
mice were almost double when compared with the number of
CD4+Foxp3+ cells in spleen from naı̈ve young A2xFVB and A2xneu
mice (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the excess of Tregs might
control the activation of immune responses in old and old tolerant
hosts in a more stringent manner (35).
Analysis of peptide-specific T-cell responses after CpG-ODN
treatment and Treg depletion. Our results indicate that CpGODN enhances the immune responses in old mice. Next, we
evaluated whether the priming of T-cell responses could be
enhanced in the presence of CpG-ODN and depletion of Tregs in
old mice. Young and old A2xFVB and A2xneu mice were
immunized with the p773–782 (Fig. 5) peptide in combination

with CpG-ODN and in the presence or absence of anti-GITR. Our
data indicated that CTL responses were not significantly altered in
young A2xFVB mice in the presence of CpG-ODN or after depletion
of Tregs with anti-GITR (Fig. 5A). However, an additive effect was
observed when old A2xFVB and young and old A2xneu mice were
treated with CpG-ODN plus anti-GITR resulting in an enhanced
cytotoxic activity (Fig. 5A). Our results also indicate that the killing
activity of CTLs from young and old A2xFVB (Fig. 5B) and A2xneu
(Fig. 5C) against the N202.A2 cells was enhanced in the presence of
CpG-ODN and anti-GITR. No killing was observed against N202
cells (Her-2/neu+/A2.1 ). Overall, these results indicate that the
CTL responses were restored in old A2xFVB mice almost to similar
levels as the young A2xFVB mice and the CTL responses were
significantly enhanced in young and old A2xneu mice. Next, we
evaluated whether the enhanced cytotoxic activity after CpG-ODN
plus anti-GITR treatment correlated with an increase in peptidespecific CTL frequency. The frequency of p773 peptide-specific
CTLs was evaluated by ELISPOT assay. As shown in Fig. 5D, old
A2xFVB and young A2xneu mice immunized with p773 in the
presence of CpG-ODN plus anti-GITR showed a f3-fold increase
in the frequency of p773 peptide–specifc CD8 T-cells when
compared with p773 peptide–immunized mice. Animals immunized with p773 peptide plus CpG-ODN or peptide plus anti-GITR
showed only a slight increase in the frequency of p773 peptide–
specifc CD8 T-cells, indicating that there is a cooperative effect
when CpG-ODN and anti-GITR is used at the same time. In the
presence of anti-Rat antibody, no improvements in the immune
responses were observed. These data suggest that the improvement
of the immune response in the presence of CpG-ODN plus antiGITR is due to a greater number of peptide-specific T cells that
were expanded after immunization. Taken together, these results
indicate that the incorporation of an adjuvant that induces a strong

proinflammatory response like CpG-ODN plus Treg depletion into
the immunization protocols could be critical to effectively prime a
T-cell response in young and old tolerant hosts.
Evaluation of CpG-ODN treatment and Treg depletion in
young and old A2xneu mice. Having shown that CpG-ODN
treatment and depletion of Tregs with anti-GITR has an additive
effect significantly enhancing the CTL responses, we evaluated
whether this treatment could induce an immune response capable
of controlling tumor growth in young and old A2xneu mice. The
combination of CpG-ODN plus anti-GITR induced the rejection of
the N202.A2 tumor in five of seven young A2xneu mice (Fig. 6A).
Treatment with anti-GITR monoclonal antibody alone has no
antitumor effect (data not shown). Treatment with CpG-ODN plus
anti-GITR significantly delayed the tumor growth in old A2xneu
mice (Fig. 6A) and prolonged the survival of the animals (Fig. 6C)
when compared with control animals. However, none of the
animals could reject or control the tumor growth. Young A2xneu
mice that rejected the primary tumor were challenged with a
second tumor and two of five animals rejected the tumor challenge
indicating that these animals could develop a memory response. To
assess whether the antitumor responses could be enhanced, young
and old A2xneu mice were immunized with a mixture of p369,
p773, and helper peptide in combination with i.t. injections of CpGODN plus anti-GITR. As shown in Fig. 5B, seven of seven young
A2xneu mice rejected the primary tumor and six of seven rejected
the tumor challenge. In old A2xneu mice, we observed that two of
seven animals rejected the primary tumor and those mice which
did not reject the tumor, had a significant delay in tumor growth
(Fig. 5B) and further prolonged the survival of the animals when
compared with animals treated with CpG-ODN and anti-GITR
alone (Fig. 5C). However, old A2xneu mice that rejected the tumor
did not develop memory responses (Fig. 5B). Peptide immunization

alone has a minimal effect in preventing tumor growth in young
A2xneu mice (26). These results indicate that although it was
possible to restore the primary and secondary antitumor immune
responses in young tolerant hosts, the same therapy was not as
effective in old tolerant hosts.

Discussion
Although many laboratories are evaluating a variety of
vaccination strategies to induce antitumor immune responses,
none of these laboratories have taken into consideration the effect
that aging has on the immune responses. Because the immune
system of the aged is different to that of the young, and is in a state
of hyporesponsiveness, the conclusions drawn from studies on
young animals cannot be extrapolated to represent the events
taking placed in aged individuals. Studies from our group (19, 20)
and other groups (21–23) indicate that the antitumor responses
can be exploited in old mice. However, all these studies rely on
tumor models that are immunogenic. As such, it will be very
difficult to translate the results from these immunogenic tumor

www.aacrjournals.org

models into a clinical setting for the treatment of tumors in the
old. There have been no reports, thus far, evaluating antitumor
immune responses in aged tumor models in which tolerance and
tumor progression are present simultaneously. Therefore, it is clear
that there is a need for relevant animal tumor models in which it
would be possible to evaluate immune and antitumor responses in
aged tolerant hosts.
We have previously shown that A2xneu mice are tolerant to neu
antigens (26). Our data indicate that one of the consequences of
crossing FVB-neu mice with A2.1/Kb mice (A2xneu) is that
spontaneous tumors appear in these animals when they are 22 to
27 months old. Therefore, the A2xneu mouse model represents a
unique model in which aging, tolerance, and tumor progression are
present simultaneously. The A2xneu mouse model closely reflects
human disease wherein the testing of immune responses,
vaccination, or immunologic strategies against self-tumor antigens
will have a higher chance of being relevant in the human situation.
Previous studies from our group indicate that N202.A2 cells are
rejected by young A2xFVB (nontolerant host) mice but are able to
grow in young A2xneu mice (tolerant host) due to tolerance

considerations (26). Following the injection of N202.A2 cells into
old A2xFVB mice, these animals lost the ability to reject the tumor
cells. This is an indication of decay in immune function in the old.
Also, the priming ability and cytotoxic responses in old A2xFVB
mice were significantly lower than young A2xFVB mice. The CTL
activity from old A2xFVB (nontolerant) mice was similar to the
cytotoxic activity of CTL from young A2xneu (tolerant) mice. Old
A2xneu mice generated a very weak CTL response when compared
with young A2xneu mice. Taken together, these results indicate
that aging compromises the ability to promote T-cell responses and
it is more difficult to prime an immune response against self-tumor
antigens in old tolerant hosts. These results have important clinical
implication considering that the majority of tumor antigens are
self-proteins (36) and that more than 50% of newly diagnosed
cancers are from the elderly (37).
Our results indicated that i.t. injections of CpG-ODN could
rescue the immune response and promote antitumor responses in
A2xFVB old mice. One hundred percent of old A2xFVB survived
and developed a protective memory response. However, only 30%
of young A2xneu survived but none of these animals were able to
develop a memory response. Young A2xneu mice that did not reject
tumors significantly survived for longer periods of time when
compared with control animals. In contrast, none of the old
A2xneu mice survived after CpG-ODN treatment, and a very subtle
delay in survival was observed when compared with the control
group. A possible explanation for why old A2xFVB mice rejected
the tumor whereas young or old A2xneu did not is in the type of
T-cell repertoire that exists against the self–tumor antigens present
in each host (38, 39). We have shown that A2xneu mice only
contain a low-affinity repertoire for neu antigens and it is more

difficult to activate and expand this population (26–28). Even
though the immune system of the old is diminished, old A2xFVB
mice might have high-affinity T-cells for neu antigens, and under
proper conditions, these cells could be activated and expanded
resulting in the activation of an effective antitumor response
(20, 21). There is strong evidence indicating that Tregs continuously suppress self-reactive T cells (40). We analyzed whether
young and old mice differ at the level of Tregs. Our results indicate
that old A2xFVB or A2xneu mice have double the amount of Tregs
when compared with young A2xFVB or A2xneu mice (35). This
could be an indication that the accumulation of Tregs might
influence or inhibit the activation of immune responses in the old
(41). Next, we evaluate the effect of CpG-ODN or CpG-ODN plus
Treg depletion with anti-GITR monoclonal antibody in enhancing
CTL responses. Our results show that treatment with CpG-ODN or
anti-GITR monoclonal antibody alone slightly enhances the
peptide-specific CTL responses in old A2xFVB or in young and
old A2xneu mice. However, when CpG-ODN and anti-GITR was
combined, an additive effect was observed and the CTL responses
were stronger in old A2xFVB or young and old A2xneu mice. The
CTLs from young and old A2xneu mice were capable of recognizing
N202.A2 targets, albeit at significantly lower levels than CTLs from
young and old A2xFVB mice. The stronger cytotoxic activity
against T2-A2/Kb peptide-pulsed cells or N202.A2 cells observed
after CpG-ODN and anti-GITR treatment in old A2xFVB and young
and old A2xneu mice correlate with the higher frequency of
peptide-specific CTLs. These data suggest that the improvement of
the immune response in the presence of CpG-ODN and anti-GITR
is most probably due to the greater number of tumor-specific T
cells that were expanded after immunization. Having demonstrated

Effect of Aging in the Activation of Immune Responses

Figure 5. Additive effect of CpG-ODN and Treg depletion in augmenting the CTL responses in old mice. Young and old A2xFVB and A2xneu mice were immunized
with the p773–783 peptide in the presence of CpG-ODN alone, anti-GITR alone, or the combination of CpG-ODN plus anti-GITR. Stimulated spleen cells were
assayed at a 30:1 E/T ratio for cytotoxicity activity. A, CTLs derived from young and old A2xFVB and A2xneu mice immunized with p773–783 peptide in combination
with CpG-ODN and anti-GITR were assayed against T2-A2/Kb target cells pulsed with p773–783 or HIV-POL peptide. The p773–783-CTLs derived from young and old
A2xFVB (B ) and A2xneu (C ) mice were assayed for specific killing activity of 51Cr-labeled N202.A2 (A2.1+/Her-2/neu+) and N202 (A2.1 /Her-2/neu+) cells. CTLs
derived from animals immunized with p773–783 peptide in combination with CpG-ODN and anti-GITR were assayed against N202 cells. D, analysis of the
frequency of p773–783-CTL in young and old A2xFVB and A2xneu after p773–783 peptide vaccination in the presence or absence of CpG-ODN and anti-GITR.
Lipopolysaccharide blast cells pulsed with no peptide were included to evaluate the background in the assay. An anti-Rat antibody was used as a control to evaluate the
specificity of the anti-GITR. Columns, mean of three individually analyzed mice per group representative of two independent experiments; bars, SE. A significant
P < 0.05 difference was found between mice injected with peptide plus control-ODN mice injected with peptide plus CpG-ODN plus anti-GITR.

that CpG-ODN and anti-GITR significantly enhance the CTL
responses in young and old A2xneu mice, we then tested the
effect of this combination therapy in activating an antitumor
response. Our results indicate that five of seven young A2xneu mice
treated with CpG-ODN plus anti-GITR induce the rejection of
tumors and two of five of the animals that rejected the primary
tumor developed a memory response. The same therapy delayed
the tumor growth and prolonged the survival of old A2xneu mice,
however, none of the animals rejected the tumor. The combination
of specific-peptide vaccination with CpG-ODN plus anti-GITR
resulted in 100% of the young A2xneu mice rejecting the primary
response, and six of seven animals developing a memory response.
Although this treatment significantly delayed tumor growth and
prolonged the survival of old A2xneu mice, none of the animals
developed a memory response. These results show that depletion
of Tregs in combination with CpG-ODN and peptide vaccination
induced an antitumor response capable of restoring the immune

response in young tolerant hosts. Although the same therapy
significantly enhanced the antitumor responses in old tolerant
hosts, it was not capable of restoring the immune responses in
these animals. These results raise the question as to why old
A2xneu mice could not mount an immune response capable of
rejecting the primary tumor or develop memory responses. New
preliminary data from our laboratory indicate that (a) the T-cell
receptor of old T cells is disengaged when compared with young T
cells, (b) more indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase is produced in old
mice when compared with young mice, and (c) there is a higher
accumulation of myeloid suppressor cells in old mice when
compared with young mice.1 Therefore, it is possible that the
accumulation of these defects further influence the immune

system, diminishing the activation of immune responses in old
mice. As such, the depletion of Tregs alone might not be sufficient
for the complete restoration of immune responses in old tolerant
hosts and perhaps it is necessary to use alternative strategies to
overcome an excess of immune-suppression and dysfunctional
alterations. Future studies are required to better understand the
immune function of old antigen-presenting cells and T cells, or
answer why there is an accumulation of Tregs or other immunesuppressor mechanisms in old mice which impinge the activation
of tumor-specific immune responses.
Although we might be able to develop immunotherapeutic
protocols that are effective in controlling tumor growth in young
A2xneu mice, we have to make sure that the same protocols are
also effective in old tolerant animals because cancer is primarily a

disease of aging individuals. Therefore, to optimize any immunotherapeutic therapy, it is important to consider the immune system
of the aged because it is associated with a dramatic reduction in
responsiveness as well as functional dysregulation (42, 43). The
A2xneu mice represent the first animal model in which it is now
possible to evaluate the antitumor immune responses in both old
and self-antigen–tolerant hosts. This model is invaluable and is of
great importance because the results derived from it will allow us
to optimize antitumor immune responses in the old. Our group is
currently evaluating the immune responses and strategies to
further enhance antitumor responses in old A2xneu mice. For
example, we have shown that there is a cooperative effect between
antiangiogenic therapy and immunotherapy (44). Perhaps for
complete tumor destruction in old tumor-bearing hosts, it might

combination with CpG-ODN plus depletion
of Tregs enhances antitumor responses in
young and old A2xneu mice. A, young and
old A2xneu mice were inoculated s.c. on
day 0 with 106 N202.A2 cells. On days 9,
16, and 23, animals were injected with
anti-GITR (300 Ag/injection). On day 10,
animals started i.t. injections of CpG-ODN
thrice a week for 3 wk (30 Ag/injection).
Young A2xneu mice that rejected the tumor
were challenged 70 d later with a 106 dose
of N202.A2 cells. Tumor volume was
measured every 3 to 5 d by caliper in two
dimensions. Control points, mean within
the group; bars, SE. Individual treated
young and old A2xneu mice are indicated.
B, young and old A2xneu mice were
implanted with N202.A2 tumors as
indicated above and immunized with a
mixture of p369–377, p773–783, and
helper peptide on day 10. Peptide
immunizations were repeated on days 20
and 30. CpG-ODN and anti-GITR was
applied as indicated above. Tumor
volume was measured every 3 to 5 d.
C, survival was monitored and the
percentage of survival of all treated mice
was determined. Seven animals were
included per group. A significant P < 0.001
and P < 0.05 difference was found
between control mice and young and old
A2xneu mice, respectively.

be necessary to use two forms of therapies to increase the
antitumor efficacy. The A2xneu mouse model will enable us to
uncover some of the cellular basis for the decline in immune
function in the elderly and determine the conditions and strategies
to augment the antitumor activity against self-tumor antigens in
the aged. The information generated from these animals will be
more comparable to the aging environment and the results
obtained from this animal tumor model would have a better
chance to be translated for the treatment of cancer in the old.
