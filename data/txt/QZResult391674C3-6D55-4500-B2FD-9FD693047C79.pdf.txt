ABSTRACT
We used the fluorescence ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (FUCCI) to
monitor cell cycle arrest after treatment of FUCCI-expressing HeLa cells (FUCCIHeLa) with a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) herbal mixture LQ, previously
shown to have anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activity in mouse models. Paclitaxel
was used as the positive control. In 2D monolayer culture, the untreated control
had approximately 45% of the cells in S/G2/M phase. In contrast, the LQ-treated
cells (9 mg/ml) were mostly in the G0/G1 (>90%) after 72 hours. After treatment
with paclitaxel (0.01 μm), for 72 hours, 95% of the cells were in S/G2/M. In 2.5D
Matrigel® culture, the colonies in the untreated control group had 40% of the cells
in S/G2/M. LQ arrested the cells in G0/G1 after 72 hours. Paclitaxel arrested almost
all the cells in S/G2/M after 72 hours. In 3D Gelfoam® culture, the untreated control
culture had approximately 45% of cells in G2/M. In contrast, the LQ-treated cells
were mostly in G0/G1 phase (>80%) after 72 hours treatment. Paclitaxel resulted
in 90% of the cells arrested in S/G2/M after 72 hours. The present report suggests
the non-toxic LQ has potential to maintain cancers in a quiescent state for long
periods of time.

lung cancer models, they caused significant weight loss
and organ toxicity. LQ also had anti-angiogenic activity
as observed in lung tumors growing in nestin-driven
green fluorescent protein (ND-GFP) transgenic nude
mice, which selectively express GFP in nascent blood
vessels. LQ also increased survival of tumor-bearing
mice, comparable to DOX. In vitro, lung cancer cells
were killed by LQ, comparable to cisplatinum. LQ
selectively killed cancer cell lines compared to normal
cell strains unlike cytotoxic drugs which killed both
similarly [1].

INTRODUCTION
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) composi­
tions usually comprise multiple herbs and many
components may be are necessary for efficacy. We
previously compared the efficacy of the TCM herbal
mixture LQ against lung cancer in mouse models with
doxorubicin (DOX) and cyclophosphamide (CTX).
LQ was effective against primary and metastatic lung
cancer without weight loss and organ toxicity. In
contrast, although CTX and DOX had efficacy in the

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In another previous study, LQ significantly
inhibited pancreatic cancer tumor growth and metastasis
in orthotopic models with no overt toxicity. LQ also
increased survival of tumor‐bearing mice. The antitumor
efficacy of LQ was comparable with gemcitabine (GEM),
but with less toxicity than GEM [2].
Sakaue-Sawano et al. [3] developed a fluorescence
ubiquitination-based cell-cycle indicator (FUCCI).
With FUCCI, G0/G1 cells express an orange-red
fluorescent protein and S/G2/M cells express a yellowgreen fluorescent protein. We previously determined
with FUCCI imaging the cell-cycle phase of invading
cancer cells [4] and the spatial-temporal cell-cycle phase
distribution of cancer cells within tumors before and after
chemotherapy [5].
The present report uses FUCCI imaging to demon­
strate the effect of LQ on the cell cycle arrest of HeLa
cells.

Effect of LQ or paclitaxel on the cell-cycle phase
distribution of FUCCI-HeLa cells growing in
2D culture
Untreated control HeLa-FUCCI cells exhibited
a combination of orange-red and yellow-green nuclei.
Approximately 60% of the cells were in S/G2/M and 40%
in G0/G1. The cultures were approaching confluence. After
treatment with LQ (9 mg/ml) for 72 hours, the HeLa-FUCCI
cells were almost all arrested in G0/G1. Only approximately
5% were in S/G2/M phases and the remainder in G0/G1.
After treatment with paclitaxel (0.01 μM), for 72 hours,
approximately 5% of the cells were in G0/G1 with the rest of
the cells arrested in S/G2/M. Almost all the paclitaxel-treated
cells fluoresced yellow-green, in contrast to LQ-treated cells,
which almost all fluoresced orange-red (Figure 1).

Figure 1: LQ or paclitaxel treatment of FUCCI-HeLa cells growing in 2D culture. G0/G1 arrest of HeLa FUCCI cells was

observed with LQ (9 mg/ml) treatment. Untreated control cells were distributed throughout the cell cycle. Paclitaxel was used as the
positive control and resulted in an S/G2/M block. Bar graphs show the distribution of the cell-cycle phases with each treatment or control.

Effect of LQ or paclitaxel on the cell-cycle phase
distribution of FUCCI-HeLa cells growing in
2.5D Matrigel culture

Effect of LQ or paclitaxel on the cell-cycle phase
distribution of FUCCI-HeLa cells growing in
Gelfoam® histoculture

The untreated control cells exhibited a combination
of orange-red and yellow-green nuclei with the cells
growing in colonies. Approximately 50% of the cells
were in S/G2/M and 50% in G0/G1. LQ (9 mg/ml) had a
similar effect in Matrigel as on plastic, with most of the
cells arresting in G0/G1 and only 10% in S/G2/M after 72
hours of treatment. Paclitaxel (0.01 μM) in 2.5 D Matrigel
culture, as in 2D culture, arrested the cells almost all in
S/G2/M after 72 hours treatment (Figure 2).

Control cells in Gelfoam® histoculture exhibited
a combination of orange-red and yellow-green nuclei.
Approximately 60% of the cells were in S/G2/M with almost
20% in M, a surprisingly large percentage. Treatment with
LQ (9 mg/M) for 72 hours resulted in over 80% of the
cells being arrested in G0/G1, similar to 2 D plastic culture
and 2.5 D Matrigel culture. Paclitaxel (0.01 μM) resulted
in 90% of the cells arrested in S/G2/M, as in 2D and 2.5D
culture, after 72 hours treatment (Figure 3).

Figure 2: LQ or paclitaxel treatment of FUCCI-HeLa cells growing in 2.5D Matrigel culture. G0/G1 arrest of HeLa-FUCCI

cells was observed with LQ (9 mg/ml) treatment. Untreated control cells were distributed throughout the cell cycle. Paclitaxel was used as
the positive control and resulted in an S/G2/M block. Bar graphs show the distribution of the cell-cycle phases. See Materials and Methods
for details.

Methionine deprivation, either by nutritional means
or recombinant methioninase (rMETase) treatment,
selectively trapped cancer cells in S/G2 [6, 7]. Excess
thymidine, or its analogs, arrested cancer cells in S-phase
[8–10]. The calcium-channel blocker mibefradil arrested
glioblastoma cells at the G1/S checkpoint [11]. Statins,
such as Lovastatin, can arrest cancer cells in G0/G1 [12,
13]. PDO332991, a pyridopyrimidine-selective inhibitor
of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, induced early-G0/G1
arrest in various cancer cell types, including melanoma and
breast cancer in vitro, and in cancer xenograft models. RO3306, also a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, reversibly
arrested 95% of treated cells in G2 phase [14–17]. Since LQ

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

has been shown to be non-toxic, it has potential to maintain
cancers in a quiescent state for long periods of time.
Previously-developed concepts and strategies
of highly-selective tumor targeting [18–29] can take
advantage of cell-cycle imaging of cancer cells and G0/G1
blockage by LQ, described in the present report.

Imaging of FUCCI-expressing HeLa cells

FUCCI-expressing HeLa cells were grown as
monolayer in 35 mm dishes in DMEM supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum.

Confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed
with the FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope
(Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan) with 2 laser diodes
(473 nm and 559 nm). A 4× (0.20 numerical aperture
immersion) objective lens and a 20× (0.95 numerical
aperture immersion) objective lens (Olympus) were
used. Scanning and image acquisition were controlled
by Fluoview software (Olympus). The tracing data were
imported to Velocity 6.0 version (Perkin Elmer), where all
3D analysis was performed [32].

Paclitaxel (Taxol) (Bedford Laboratories, Bedford,
OH) was prepared by diluting to 0.2 μM as a stock
solution.

Matrigel (2.5 D culture)
Matrigel (100 μl/chamber well) was pipetted into the
center of the well and then allowed to spread evenly for
15–30 minutes at 37°C in order for the Matrigel to solidify.
FUCCI-expressing HeLa cells (4 × 104) were grown for
4 days in Matrigel and DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum.

Preparation of crude extracts of chinese herbs

Author contributions

LQ consists of a mixture of the following
Chinese medicinal herbs: Sinapis alba, Atractylodes
macrocephala, Coix lacryma-jobi, and Polyporus adusta
(School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Traditional
Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, China) as previously
reported [30]. The ratio of the herbs used was (2:3:4:3).
Dried plant parts used were: Sinapis albe, seed;
Atractylodes macrocephala, root; Coix lacryma-jobi,
kernel; Polyporus adusta, whole mushroom. Each herb
was extracted in boiling water for 20 mins, the solution
was filtered and the residue extracted with 75% ethanol
when filtered. The water extract and ethanolic extract
were combined and concentrated by lyophilization.
The lyophilized powder was suspended in PBS and the
mixture was vortexed for 1 min and incubated at 80°c
for 30 min., cooled to room temperature, and was then
centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant
was collected at a final concentration to 90 mg/ml and
