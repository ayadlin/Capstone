ABSTRACT
Retinal degeneration (RD), including retinitis pigmentosa (RP), is an inherited
eye disease characterized by progressive degeneration of photoreceptors. Recently,
immune cells, including microglia, Müller cells and astrocytes, in degenerative retina
are demonstrated to play key roles in the development of RD and can be used as
potential therapeutic targets. Liver X receptors (LXRs) are important immunoinflammatory response transcription factors that have been reported to be a new
potential therapeutic drug target for neurodegenerative diseases. However, the
potential therapeutic utility of LXRs for RP has not been evaluated. In the present
study, Pde6β (rd1) mice received intraperitoneal injections of T0901317 (T0, 50 mg/
kg/d) or vehicle (2% DMSO) for 7 days with age-matched C57/BL6 mice as controls.
The effect of T0 was examined by quantitating photoreceptor apoptosis, microglial
density and the expression of inflammatory mediators; the underlying mechanisms
were then explored with a microarray assay. T0 markedly delayed apoptosis of the
photoreceptors, partially through suppressing the activation of microglia and the
gliosis of Müller cells, and decreased the expression levels of IL-6, iNOS, COX-2 and
ENG in rd1 mice; as a result, the visual function of T0-treated rd1 mice measured with
electroretinograms (ERG) was preserved for a longer time than that of vehicle-treated
rd1 mice. The microarray assay showed that the Janus kinase/Signal Transducer and
Activator of Transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway was significantly affected in
the retina of rd1 mice with T0 treatment. Our data suggested that T0 modulated the
immunologic function of glia cells in the degenerative retina through the JAK3/STAT
pathway and delayed the apoptosis of photoreceptors.

Recently, inflammation [5–9] is found to play a
fundamental role in photoreceptor degeneration in the
RP animal model and RP patients. Microglia are the only
resident innate immune cells in the retina, and activation
of microglia in the retina is considered a contributing
factor in early stages of RP [8], demonstrating that
microglia can be used as a potential therapeutic target
of RD [10]. Suppressing the activation of microglia has
been proven to reduce the apoptosis of photoreceptors
in rd10 mice [11]. During the development of retinal
degeneration, the Müller cell and astrocyte processes
usually become thickened and enlarged as a response to

INTRODUCTION
Inherited retinal degeneration (RD), including
retinitis pigmentosa (RP), is characterized by selective
retinal photoreceptor cell degeneration and apoptosis
[1] [2]. RP is one of the prevalent blinding diseases in
developed countries; currently, there is no comprehensive
treatment to cure RP [3, 4]. More than 100 genes have
been reported to cause RP [3]; therefore, it is necessary to
explore the broadly shared mechanisms of RP rather than
the individual mutations.

neuro-degeneration, usually causing reactive gliosis [12,
13] and preventing the regeneration of the retina.
Liver X receptors (LXRs) are a nuclear receptor
superfamily and a type of ligand-activated transcription
factor that include two isoforms, LXRα and LXRβ [14,
15]. In addition to being involved in the regulation of lipid
metabolism, LXRs have been reported to play important
roles in the modulation of inflammation [14]. Our previous
results demonstrate that activation of LXRs usually
downregulate pro-inflammatory signals in the central
nervous system (CNS) [14, 16]. Most recently, agonists
of LXRs T0901317 (T0) and GW3965 are reported to
induce the expression of genes coding for activators of
photoreceptor guanylate cyclase and the subunit of the
cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase complex (Pde6h) in
the neural retina of zebrafish [17], suggesting that LXRs
are involved in the development of the retina and may
be an important component of the retinal metabolism
necessary for the maintenance of visual function [18,
19]. It has been reported that activation of LXRs with the
synthetic agonist T0 could protect inner retinal damage
induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate [20] or alleviate ocular
inflammation in experimental autoimmune uveitis [21].
The Pde6β (rd1) mouse, the best-characterized
classical mouse model of human RP, carries a
mutation in cyclic guanidine monophosphate (cGMP)–
phosphodiesterase 6β (Pde6β) in the rod photoreceptors.
The dysfunction of Pde6β results in the accumulation of
cGMP and causes the degeneration and apoptosis of the
rod photoreceptors [14]. It is not clear whether T0 could
delay the degeneration process of photoreceptors in the
rd1 mouse model.
In the present study, we observed the effect of T0
on the activation of microglia and Müller cells in the
degenerative retina and its influence on the expression
of cytokines including IL-6, iNOS, COX-2 and ENG, as
well as the apoptosis of photoreceptors. The function of
the retina of rd1 mice was tested with electrophysiology
(ERG). A microarray analysis was used to test the gene
expression profiles of the retina with T0 treatment of rd1
mice. We aimed to explore the immunological function
of LXRs activation and its neuroprotective effects on
photoreceptors during the development of RD as well as
its underlying mechanisms.

(Figure 1A), while the LXRβ mRNA level in the retina
of both C57 and rd1 mice is increased in comparison with
those injected with vehicle (Figure 1B). The expression of
the target genes of LXRs ABCA1 and ABCG1 in C57 and
rd1 mice is upregulated by T0 treatment compared with
vehicle treatment (Figure 1C, 1D).
The rd1 mouse model is characterized by rapid
retinal degeneration and photoreceptor apoptosis in the
outer nuclear layer (ONL) beginning on P8 and usually
peaking on P14 [2, 23]. Apoptosis of cells in the retina of
P14 C57 and rd1 mice were tested with TUNEL staining.
There are sparsely scattered TUNEL-positive cells
distributed in the ONL of C57 mice treated with vehicle
or T0 (Figure 2A, 2B). There is no significant difference
in the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the ONL of C57
mice treated with vehicle or T0 (Figure 2E). As a result,
there is no significant difference in the thickness of the
ONL of C57 mice treated with vehicle or T0 (Figure 2F).
The number of TUNEL-positive cells in the ONL of rd1
mice at P14 treated with vehicle is markedly higher than
in age-matched C57 mice treated with vehicle (Figure 2C,
2E). As a result, the thickness of the ONL of rd1 mice
treated with vehicle is significantly thinner than that of
age-matched C57 mice treated with vehicle (Figure
2F). However, 7 successive days of treatment with T0
beginning on P7 markedly reduces the number of TUNELpositive cells in the ONL of rd1 mice (Figure 2D, 2E), and
the decrease in the thickness of the ONL is also markedly
attenuated (Figure 2F).

T0 reduces gliosis in the rd1 mouse model
It has previously been shown that glial fibrillary
acidic protein (GFAP) expression in the retina is
markedly increased, and the process of gliosis initiated
at an early stage in rd1 mice, as a result of retinal
injuries and degeneration [13]. In our present study
of rd1 mice, immunofluorescence staining shows that
GFAP was expressed in the retina of both C57 mice
and rd1 mice (Figure 3A-3H), and the percentage of the
immunofluorescence intensity per field in the comparable
fields of the C57 and rd1 mice treated with vehicle
or T0 was analyzed. The results show that the GFAP
immunofluorescence intensity is significantly higher in
the rd1 mice treated with vehicle than in the C57 mice
treated with vehicle (Figure 3G, 3I). Treatment with T0
significantly reduces the GFAP immunofluorescence
intensity in the rd1 mice compared with that in the vehicletreated rd1 mice (Figure 3H, 3I). Western blots confirm the
inhibitory effect of T0 on the GFAP level in the retina of
rd1 mice (Figure 3J, 3K).

RESULTS
T0 reduces photoreceptor apoptosis and delays
retinal degeneration in the rd1 mice
As previously reported [21, 22], both LXRα and
LXRβ are expressed in the retina of C57 mice at postnatal
day (P) 14. The mRNA level of LXRα was lower in the
retina of rd1 mice compared to C57 mice at P14 [22].
In present study, after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of
T0 for 7 successive days, the LXRα mRNA level in the
retina of rd1 mice is reduced compared to their controls

are mainly distributed in the inner nuclear layers (INL)
of P14 C57 mice treated with vehicle (Figure 4A), and
the morphology of the microglia remains ramified and
slender. Hardly any Iba-1-positive microglia are observed
in the ONL of C57 mice on P14 (Figure 4A). Treatment
with T0 does not influence the number, distribution or
morphology of microglia in the retina of C57 mice on P14
(Figure 4B, 4E).
The number of Iba-1-positive microglia increases
significantly in the retina, especially in the ONL of the
P14 rd1 mice treated with vehicle, and the morphology
of the microglia is changed to the activated amoeboid
shape with few processes (Figure 4C, 4E). Treatment with
T0 markedly decreases the number of microglia in the

ONL of the retina of rd1 mice on P14 (Figure 4D, 4E).
Western blot of Iba-1 confirms the trends of the number of
microglia in the retina of C57 mice and rd1 mice treated
with T0 (Figure 4F, 4G).

T0 improves the visual function of rd1 mice
To confirm the protective effect of T0 on the
degenerative retina of rd1 mice, scotopic ERGs were
tested on P14, just after one week of treatment with T0. As
the degeneration of rods progressed, the a-wave amplitude
and b-wave amplitude in rd1 mice are dramatically
decreased compared with that in the age-matched wildtype mice (Figure 5A-5F). However, T0 treatment rescues

does not influence these genes expression in the wild-type
mice (Figure 6A-6E).

Microarray analysis of T0- or vehicletreated rd1 mice

T0 regulates the inflammatory gene expression
and innate immunity in the retina of rd1 mice

To gain further insight into the mechanisms by
which T0 influences the retina of rd1 mice, RNA was
extracted for microarray analysis at P14. As represented
in the hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed
genes (DEGs) (Figure 7), a set of 2649 DEGs is identified
in retinas of rd1 mice, including 1851 up-regulated and
798 down-regulated genes, compared with that of controls.
The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway
(KEGG) enrichment and gene ontology (GO) analyses
were performed with the DEGs (Figure 8). The three
most significantly altered pathways highlighted by KEGG
analysis are basal cell carcinoma, neuroactive ligandreceptor interaction, and JAK-STAT signaling pathways
(Figure 8A). Promotion of transcription from RNA
polymerase II, positive regulation of the macromolecule
metabolic process and regulation of transcription are the
top 3 hits from the GO biological process analysis (Figure
8B). To locate the key gene of the JAK-STAT pathway, a
network analysis was performed (Figure 9). The results
show that JAK3 is the signal transmission mediation

Previous studies have demonstrated that LXRs are
important regulators of inflammatory gene expression
and innate immunity [14]. The activation of LXRs can
repress the expression of mediators, such as inducible
nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin (IL)-6, and
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) [14]. Nuclear orphan receptor
Rev-erb can regulate the inflammatory response of
murine macrophages through the suppression of IL-6
expression [24]. ENG (Endoglin/CD105), as a part of
the transforming growth factor (TGF) receptor complex
that binds several members of the TGF-β superfamily, is
a direct target of LXRα [25]. To investigate the effect of
the activation of LXRs by T0 on the retina of rd1 mice,
RT-qPCR of multiple genes were performed. IL-6, iNOS
and COX-2 expression are significantly lower in rd1 mice
treated with T0 than in vehicle-treated mice (Figure 6A6C). T0 treatment also decreases the expression of ENG
but not Rev-erb in rd1 mice compared those in vehicle-

center in the JAK-STAT pathway of the DEGs. RT-qPCR
of multiple genes was performed to confirm the result of
microarray and network analysis (Supplementary Table 1).
The expression level of JAK3, IL4Ra, IL6Ra (Figure 10A10C) is significantly increased after the treatment with T0
in rd1 mice retina, the expression of STAT3 (Figure 10D)
remains unchanged between two groups. SOCS1 (data not
show) is rarely expressed in the retina of rd1 mice while
SOCS3 (Figure 10E) expression is markedly decreased by
the treatment of T0.

T0 was observed to suppress gliosis in the degenerative
retina of mice, alleviate the activation of microglia and
decrease the level of pro-inflammatory factors. These
results suggested that the protection effect of T0 in rd1
mice was through the immunological modulation of
LXRs. The JAK-STAT pathway was involved in the effect
of T0 on the degenerative retina.
The synthetic non-subtype selective agonist
T0901317 activates both LXRα and LXRβ. As a result,
the expression of the target genes of LXRs ABCA1 and
ABCG1 are distinctly increased. Usually, the agonists
enhance the expression of LXRs after they bind to
their receptors, and it showed in present study that the
expression of LXRβ was markedly increased when the
mice received the administration of T0, however, the
expression of LXRα in the retina remained unchanged.
LXRα is considered to play a key role in cholesterol

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we found that activation of LXR
with the synthetic agonist T0 significantly reduced the
apoptosis of photoreceptors in the ONL of rd1 mice, thus
delaying the degeneration of the retina. At the same time,

homeostasis, while LXRβ is reported to modulate the
function of immune system and CNS. LXRβ is relatively
highly expressed than LXRα in CNS [14]. We speculated
that the unchanging of LXRα expression might be a result
of competitive inhibition of binding to the agonist between
LXRα and LXRβ in the retina. In the study of Zheng et al,
when the T0 was used to protect the inner retinal damage
induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate, they also found that the
expression of LXRα was not increased while the LXRβ
expression was markedly increased [20]. In future, as
the development of a more specific and potent subtype
selective LXR agonist, the underlying mechanisms of
LXRs and RD may be clarified.
As one of the most studied retinal degeneration
models, the rd1 mouse shows significant rod photoreceptor
apoptosis as early as P10 [2, 26] that peaks at P12–14 [1]
and is completed by P21 [27]. To observe the protective
effect of an LXR agonist on rod photoreceptors of rd1
mice, we injected T0 on P7, just before the initiation of
rod photoreceptor apoptosis. On P14, after 7 days of T0
treatment, the TUNEL-positive apoptosis cell number in
the ONL was markedly lower than that of the vehicletreated rd1 mice. As a result, the thickness of the ONL
in the center and peripheral retina of rd1 mice was
markedly larger in the T0 treatment group than that in
the vehicle-treated group, suggesting that activation of
LXRs protected the photoreceptor cells from apoptosis. A
similar effect of T0 is also observed in an acute model of

retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death induced by N-methylD-aspartic acid (NMDA), in which intravitreal injected T0
significantly rescues NMDA-induced cell loss as shown
with Hematoxylin and eosin staining, TUNEL staining
and NeuN staining [20]. Although the pathological
mechanisms of RP and NMDA-induced neurotoxicity
are substantially different, activation of LXRs seems to
produce a similar protective effect on the neural cells in
the retina.
The apoptosis of photoreceptors in the rd1 mouse
caused by the accumulation of cGMP results from the
impairment of Pde6β [26]. Treatment with LXR agonists,
including T0 and GW3965, increases the expression of
genes coding for activators of photoreceptor guanylate
cyclase and the Pde6h subunit in the neural retina of the
zebrafish [17], implying that LXR agonists temporarily
clear the accumulated cGMP in retina of rd1 mice.
However, LXR agonist treatment does not fundamentally
alter the apoptotic fate of photoreceptors since the
mutation of Pde6β has not been corrected in the rd1 mice.
In retinal degeneration, gliosis of Müller cells downregulates their cytoprotective function and contributes
to edema development, neuronal hyperexcitation and
glutamate toxicity, which is a major cause of neuronal
degeneration [28]. Increased immunoreactivity for GFAP
is a well-known marker for gliosis, especially in Müller
cells [29]. Our research indicated that T0 treatment
significantly reduced the expression of GFAP in the retina

of rd1 mice, which suggested that T0 alleviated gliosis
of Müller cells, thus resulting in protection of the retina.
Additionally, glial scars established by Müller cell gliosis
could inhibit regular tissue repair and the regeneration of
the retina [30]. T0 may become a new drug for improving
the microenvironment in retinal degeneration.
The resident microglia in the retina play a
surveillance role in maintaining the homeostasis of the
immune microenvironment through the presentation

of antigens, phagocytosis of debris, and the release of
neuroprotective factors and anti-inflammatory factors [31].
The apoptosis of photoreceptors during the development
of RD was reported to trigger the activation of resident
microglia [7, 11], and our previous results confirmed this
[2]. In the present study, we observed that T0 treatment
suppressed the activation of microglia in the degenerative
retina, which might prevent the degenerated or normal
photoreceptors from being phagocytosed. Since previous

studies have demonstrated that activation of LXRs is
effective in advanced basal cell carcinoma [32], which
may not be involved in retinal degeneration of rd1 mice.
The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)
and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) are regarded as the

two classical inflammatory pathways that are involved
in the neuroimmunomodulation of glia cells in the CNS.
Besides, recently Kim et al shows that JAK-STAT, a new
inflammatory pathway, is vital in activating inflammatory
response of microglia in the brain. JAK-STAT pathway

can be activated by LPS, IFNγ, which results in the
phosphorylation of STAT molecules, dimers formation
and inflammatory genes expression [47]. The JAK-STAT
pathway has been demonstrated to mediate the protection
of photoreceptors in rd1 mice [33] or light-induced retinal
degeneration [34] and be involved in the GFAP expression
of Müller cells [35] in the mouse model. The JAK-STAT
pathway can mediate the inhibition of inflammation during
mouse uveitis [36, 37] and is involved in the inflammatory
response in the human AMD eye [38], suggesting that the
JAK-STAT pathway plays an important role in visual
inflammation. Additionally, STAT signaling plays a central
role during retinal degeneration in the rd10 mouse model
[39]. A strong induction of JAK3 mRNA levels suggested
that JAK3 plays a prominent role in rd1 mouse retinal
degeneration [40]. In present study, we demonstrated that
JAK-STAT signaling pathway is among the three most
significantly altered pathways in the retina of rd1 mice,
which were treated with T0. It suggests that the JAKSTAT also plays a key role in the development of RD and
it could be modulated by other nuclear receptors (NRs)
besides glucocorticoid receptors (GRs).

Recently LXRs are also reported to produce antiinflammatory effects through transrepression of target
genes. It demonstrated that the SUMOylation of LXRs
resulted in the tethering of STAT1 to LXRs [45, 46]. By
activating with the natural and synthetic LXR agonists such
as T0901317 and GW3965, the LXRs are widely used in
the experimental treatment of a serial of neurodegenerative
diseases including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease,
Multiple Sclerosis and Huntington’s Disease [14]. Our
present study has shown that JAK-STAT signaling pathway
plays an important role in the protection of the retina of rd1
mice. JAK3, which is reported to be primarily expressed
in immune-cells, is prominently increased at P14 (5-fold)
of rd1 mice [40]; it suggests that JAK3 is involved in the
development of retina degeneration. The microarray data
showed that the expression of JAK3 in the retina of rd1
mice was markedly increased after T0 treatment. According
to the possible mechanism of LXRs modulating the JAKSTAT pathway [46], we hypothesized that the increase
of JAK3 expression was a result of feedback inhibition
receding. To test this, the expression of JAK3, STAT3 and
their downstream genes SOCS1 and SOCS3 were analyzed

with RT-qPCR. It showed that the expression of JAK3 in
the retina of rd1 mice treated with T0 was significantly
increased compared with those treated with vehicle, while
the SOCS3 expression was decreased markedly. The
expression of STAT3 was unchanged between the two
groups. It is consistent with previous report [40, 46].

In conclusion, JAK3-STAT pathway played a crucial
role during the retina degeneration process of rd1 mice; the
activation of LXRs protected rd1 mouse retina and rescued
visual function by suppressing the immune inflammation
mediated by JAK3-STAT pathway. LXRs agonist might
become new therapeutic agents for RP.

All staining (immunofluorescence and TUNEL
assay) was viewed and photographed with a Leica TCS
SP50 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems). The
thickness of the ONL was analyzed from six locations
from the optic nerve head in five retinal sections of five
rd1 mice using Photoshop CS5 (Adobe Systems).
The number of Iba-1-positive cells or TUNELpositive cells in the retina was analyzed using stereological
principles on serially cut sections of retina. For every
retina sample, all Iba-1-positive cells or TUNEL-positive
cells were counted in every 20th section, resulting in the
analysis of 15–20 sections. The total number of cells
was obtained by multiplying the number of cells by the
sampling fractions [42]. For each cell slide analysis, at
least seven fields amplified by 400 × were chosen to count.

Animals
Rd1 and C57/BL6 mice were purchased from the
Third Military Medical University (TMMU) and housed
with a 12-h light/dark cycle and ad libitum access to water
and food. All experimental procedures were approved by
the Animal Care and Use Committee of the TMMU and
carried out in accordance with the guidelines for laboratory
animal care and use issued by the Chinese Council on
Animal Research and the Guidelines of Association for
Research in Vision and Ophthalmology.

Drug treatment
T0901317 (Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) was
dissolved in 100% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at 1 g/ml
and was stored in aliquots at -20°C. Before administration
to mice, the DMSO was diluted with PBS to a final
concentration of 2% [13, 14].
The day of birth was designated as postnatal day
0 (P0). On P7, pups were randomly divided into four
groups: T0-treated rd1 group, vehicle-treated rd1 group
(2% DMSO in PBS), T0-treated C57 group and vehicletreated C57 group. An i.p. injection of T0 (50 mg/kg/d)
was given for 7 successive days; control mice received the
same volume of vehicle (Supplementary Figure 1).

Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed according to
our previous methods [43]. After eyes were enucleated
from sacrificed mice, the retinas were isolated from the
globe and mixed in ice-cold tissue lysis buffer (1% PSMF
+ 99% RIPA). The mix was milled using a glass-stirring rod
for 5 min to fully lyse the tissue. The lysates were cleared
by centrifugation at 2000 g at 4°C for 30 min, and then the
protein concentration of the supernatants was determined
using a bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) (Beyotime, China).
As previously reported [2], 30 μg of protein sample from
each group was separated using a 15% sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Bio-Rad).
After blocking with 5% nonfat milk in tris-buffered saline/
Tween (TBST), the membranes were incubated with antiGFAP (1:500; Abcam), anti-Iba-1 (1:500; Wako) and antiglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
(1:1000; CWbio, China) overnight at 4°C. The next day, the
membranes were washed with TBST three times and then
incubated with peroxidase-conjugated immunoglobulin G
(1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as secondary antibodies.
Finally, the protein bands were scanned with the Odyssey
infrared imager system. Staining was then quantified and
analyzed by image lab software using GAPDH as an internal
control.

Histologic processing
Mice were sacrificed at P14. Eyeballs were
enucleated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at
room temperature for 30 min. The anterior segments were
then removed microscopically and fixed in 4% PFA for
another 1.5 h. Then, the eyes were infiltrated with 30%
sucrose overnight at 4°C and embedded at optimal cutting
temperature (OCT) (Sakura) for cryosection preparation.
Using a freezing microtome (Thermo), 10-μm-thick
sections were cut in a sagittal plane as described
previously [41]. Serial sections were collected through the
pupillary-optic nerve axis.
The immunofluorescence of sections was analyzed
as described previously [2]. Sections were incubated
in 0.3% Triton X-100 and 3% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) at room temperature for 30 min. Subsequently,
the sections were incubated with the primary antibody
anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (1:500; Abcam,
Cambridge, UK) or anti-Ionized calcium binding adaptor
molecule 1 (Iba-1) (1:500; Wako, Japan) in 1% BSA
at 4°C overnight. Then, sections were incubated with
488- or cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200;
Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) for
1 h at 37°C. Before examination with a confocal laser
scanning microscope (CLSM, Leica Germany), sections
were counterstained with 4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole

Real-time quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (RT-qPCR)
The RT-qPCR experiment was performed as
previously described [18]. In brief, total RNA was

extracted using TRIZOL (Sigma Aldrich) according to the
instructions of the manufacturer. The concentration of the
RNA was measured using a spectrophotometric instrument
(NanoDrop). Total RNA (approximately 1-2 μg per 20 μl
reaction) was reverse transcribed using a PrimeScript RT
Reagent Kit (Takara). qPCR was performed with a CFX96
Real-Time PCR system (Bio-Rad) using a SYBR Green
qPCR Mix (Takara) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Relative expression levels were normalized
to cyclophilin-A and were calculated using the 2-ΔΔC (t)
method. All of the primers were purchased from Sangon
Biotech (Supplementary Table 1) The PCR cycling was
designed as follows: 5 min at 94°C, 35 cycles of 30 s at
94°C, 30 s at 65°C, 30 s at 72°C, 10 min at 72°C and
storage at 4°C.

Statistical analysis
The data are presented as the mean ± SEM. Data
were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by
Fisher's protected least-significant difference post hoc
tests in RT-qPCR, histologic analysis, ERG analysis and
Western blot analysis with the SPSS 21.0 software. For
all comparisons, the significance level was set at P < 0.05.

Electroretinograms (ERG)
Visual electrophysiological tests were performed
as described previously [41, 43]. Before the test, mice
at P14 were dark-adapted for nearly 12 h. Intramuscular
injections of amine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (12 mg/
kg) were performed for anesthesia. Pupils were dilated
with one-drop tropicamide and phenylephrine. Gold wire
loops were used as recording electrodes for cornea ERG
recordings, and 0.9% saline was frequently applied on the
cornea to prevent dehydration and allow electrical contact.
Two stainless steel needles inserted under the scleral
conjunctiva around the equator of the eyes served as the
reference electrodes, and another needle placed in the tail
served as the ground. Then, the mice were subjected to
sequences of scotopic flashes of -20 and 0 db; the flash
interval was set at 60-120 s to avoid any adapting effect
from the previous flash. Data were acquired by the Retiscan system (Roland, Germany) and processed by Igor.
