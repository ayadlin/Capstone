Abstract:

It is well established that the PI3K pathway plays a central role in various
cellular processes that can contribute to the malignant phenotype. Accordingly,
pharmacological inhibition of key nodes in this signaling cascade has been
a focus in developmental therapeutics. To date, agents targeting upstream
receptor tyrosine kinases are best studied and have achieved greatest clinical
success. Further downstream, despite efficacy in certain tumor types, the
rapalogs have been somewhat disappointing in the clinic. Novel inhibitors of
PI3K, Akt, and mTORC1 and 2 are now passing through early phase clinical
trials. It is hoped that these agents will circumvent some of the shortcomings
of the rapalogs and lead to meaningful benefits for cancer patients.

INTRODUCTION

(I-III) of PI3K are described that vary in structure and
substrate preference. The heterodimers that make up class
I PI3Ks consist of a regulatory and a catalytic subunit. In
the class IA group, these are p85 and p110 (α, β and δ),
respectively, whereas the class IB PI3K consists of p101
and p110γ [2]. Class II PI3Ks are monomeric catalytic
isoforms, and the sole class III member is Vps34.
Isoform-specific functions of the class I PI3Ks are
described, albeit with some redundancy, with potential
implications for toxicity and efficacy of novel inhibitors of
this class [3]. In broad terms, the ubiquitously expressed
p110α and p110β influence cellular proliferation and
insulin signaling, whereas p110γ and p110δ, primarily
expressed in leukocytes, appear involved in immune
function and inflammation. Class II PI3Ks assist in the
regulation of membrane trafficking and the class III
PI3K is involved in autophagy [4]. Class IA PI3Ks are
implicated in human cancer.
Upstream receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that feed
into the PI3K pathway include members of the human
epidermal growth factor receptor family (EGFR and
HER2), platelet derived growth factor receptor, and the
insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptors.
Engagement of a growth factor with its RTK is the typical
initiating event for activation of class IA PI3Ks, where
RTK stimulation leads to an interaction with p85 in the
tyrosine kinase domain. This can occur either directly

The PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) pathway
is a signal transduction cascade that is central to a variety
of important physiological functions, including cell cycle,
cell survival, protein synthesis and growth, metabolism,
motility and angiogenesis. Constitutive pathway
activation, which occurs in human cancer at considerable
frequency due to a variety of genetic aberrations, can
induce a malignant phenotype by contributing to the
hallmarks of cancer. Many small molecule inhibitors
targeting key nodes in the pathway – PI3K, Akt and mTOR
(mammalian target of rapamycin) – are at various stages
of clinical development. Clinical experience is adding to
the preclinical knowledge base regarding these agents,
broadening not only the understanding of the similarities
and differences between the compounds, but also of the
machinations of the pathway itself. In this review we will
focus on the development of those inhibitors that have
reached clinical evaluation and how their future use may
evolve.

THE PI3K/Akt/mTOR PATHWAY
The PI3Ks are a family of lipid kinases that share
the primary biochemical function to phosphorylate the
3-hydroxyl group of phosphoinositides [1]. Three classes

(such as with HER3) or indirectly via adaptor molecules
(such as the insulin receptor substrate 1, IRS1). Binding
removes the inhibitory effect of p85 on p110, resulting in
full activation of PI3K. The activated kinase converts its
substrate phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate – PI(4,5)
P2 – into PI(3,4,5)P3. PI(3,4,5)P3 (or PIP3) acts as a
docking site bringing Akt and PDK1 into close proximity,
allowing the latter to phosphorylate Akt at threonine-308 in
its kinase domain. The mTOR-rictor complex (mTORC2)
also contributes a phosphate group to Akt, at serine-473 in
its helical domain. Both events are necessary for full Akt
activity [5].
Akt, a serine/threonine kinase, is the central mediator
of the PI3K pathway with multiple downstream effectors
that influence key cellular processes (see figure 1). Akt
stimulates protein synthesis and cell growth by activating
mTOR (as part of the mTOR-raptor or mTORC1 complex)

through effects on the intermediary tuberous sclerosis
(TSC) 1/2 complex. It influences cellular proliferation
by inactivating cell cycle inhibitors (p27 and p21) and
promoting cell cycle proteins (c-Myc and cyclin D1) [6,7].
Akt mediated inhibition of pro-apoptotic genes (BAD and
BIM) and degradation of the tumor suppressor protein p53
limits programmed cell death and enhances cell survival
[4]. PI3K also features in cellular metabolism and insulin
signaling through actions on GSK3 [8].
PI3K pathway activity can be switched off through
the action of various proteins. The SHIP phosphatases
abrogate signaling by converting PIP3 into the alternate
PI(3,4)P2. A second mechanism involves the PTEN
(phosphate and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome
ten) tumor suppressor, a dual specificity phosphatase
that dephosphorylates both protein and lipid substrates.
Importantly, PTEN antagonizes PI3K function and

Figure 1. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and associated inhibitors. A ligand engaged RTK binds PI3K, either directly or
indirectly via adaptor molecules such as IRS1, removing the inhibitory action of the p85 regulatory subunit on the catalytic p110 subunit. The
active kinase generates PIP3 at the lipid membrane. PIP3 facilitates the phosphorylation of Akt by PDK1, while the mTOR-rictor complex
contributes a second phosphate residue to Akt. As the central effector of the PI3K pathway, Akt transmits signal to a host of downstream
substrates, thus influencing a variety of key cellular functions. Pathway activity is negatively regulated by PTEN and the S6K-IRS1 feedback
loop. Pharmacological inhibition of the pathway is achieved through a variety of compounds in clinical use at various points along the pathway
that are indicated by the red ⊣.

first identified microRNA that represses PTEN expression
[18]. Finally, rare germline mutations at the PTEN locus
result in a number of overlapping clinical conditions,
including the autosomal dominant Cowden’s syndrome,
characterized by the presence of hamartomas and a
susceptibility to cancer, especially those of the breast,
thyroid and endometrium [19].
Genetic aberrations of PIK3CA, located on
chromosome 3, are also commonly found in human
cancer. Whereas mutations are most commonly described
in breast, colorectal and endometrial cancers, as well as
glioblastomas, gene amplification tends to occur with
greatest frequency in cervical, gastric, lung, head and
neck, and ovarian cancers [20]. The majority of mutations
cluster in two hot spot regions in exon 9 (encoding the
helical domain of p110α) and exon 20 (encoding the
catalytic domain of p110α). Such hot spot changes have
been shown to upregulate Akt and promote oncogenic
transformation in vitro and in vivo [21,22]. The exon
9 mutations result in E545K and E542K amino acid
substitutions and may affect interactions with regulatory
proteins, including p85. On the other hand, the exon 20
mutation causes a H1047R alteration and may affect
specificity or affinity of p110α towards its substrates [23].
It has been shown that to induce transformation, H1047R
mutants depend on p85 binding whereas E545K and
E542K mutants depend on RAS binding [24]. Precisely
how PIK3CA amplifications affect PI3K activation is less
clear.
Mutual exclusivity between mutations of PTEN
and RAS, PI3K and RAS, and PTEN and p53 has been
demonstrated in certain tumors [25-28]. In contrast,
studies suggest functional PTEN loss and PIK3CA
mutations can coexist in breast, endometrial and colon
cancer, implying a level of non-redundancy, despite
their opposing functions on phosphoinositides [29,30].
However, this is perhaps not so surprising given PTEN has
non-PI3K dependent functions and that PIK3CA codes for
only one isoform of p110, suggesting other isoforms may
influence signaling. Indeed, there is a growing body of
literature relating to the other isoforms. p110β and p110δ
(class IA), and p110γ (class IB) have not been found to
possess oncogenic mutations in human cancer. However,
overexpression of the wild-type protein of these variants
is transforming in cell culture, unlike their p110α cousin
[31]. Further, those isoforms with predominant expression
on white blood cells (p110δ and p110γ) appear to be
important in hematological malignancies [32]. Another
recently described finding of interest is that p110β drives
tumorigenesis in certain cell-based models of PTEN loss
[33].
Other elements of the PI3K pathway are also
mutated in human cancer, albeit with lower frequency than
PIK3CA mutation or PTEN loss. Mutations in PIK3R1,
coding for the p85 regulatory subunit, are observed in a
small proportion of colorectal and ovarian cancers. These

negatively regulates Akt activities by stripping a phosphate
off PIP3 thereby returning it to its original PI(4,5)P2 form.
Finally, S6K (one of the key effectors of mTOR)
can feedback to downregulate IRS1, the adaptor molecule
linking the IGF-1 receptor and PI3K. This effect appears
to be direct and to impede the ability of IRS1 to associate
with the insulin receptor. The outcome is to dampen
further input into the PI3K pathway in the presence of
ongoing stimulation of the insulin/IGF-1 receptors [9].
In addition to the complexity of the PI3K pathway,
extensive crosstalk exists with other cellular signaling
networks. For example, mTOR exerts influence on
PI3K signaling via the S6K-IRS1 feedback loop and via
mTORC2 mediated Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation [5,10].
Activation of the tumor suppressor p53 causes both
increased PTEN and decreased p110 expression. Further,
p53 degradation is reduced indirectly by PTEN via its
antagonism of PI3K [11,12]. These actions safeguard the
cell in times of genotoxic strain against ongoing DNA
replication, though the interplay between p53 and PTEN
requires further elucidation. Finally, activated GTPbound RAS proteins are capable of activating the PI3K
pathway by binding directly to p110 [13]. Downstream
of RAS, in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
pathway, ERK has been shown to negatively regulate
TSC2 [14]. Additionally, MAPK pathway activation has
been identified as a consequence of mTORC1 inhibition,
further intercalating these two important cascades [15].

GENETIC ALTERATIONS IN THE PI3K
PATHWAY IN CANCER
Deregulation of several elements of the PI3K
signaling cascade is recognized in human cancer, the
occurrence of which promotes pathway activation. The
most prevalent are those affecting PIK3CA (the gene
coding for p110α) and PTEN, as well as those affecting
upstream RTKs. This latter group has been extensively
reviewed previously and will not be discussed here.
Derangements in PTEN were the first described and
are the most common abnormalities linked with PI3K
signaling in human cancer. The PTEN gene maps to
chromosome 10q23. Functional loss of PTEN impairs its
lipid phosphatase activity, which is critical for its tumor
suppressor function [16]. Reduced PTEN expression is
found most commonly in endometrial, prostate, breast
and ovarian cancers, as well as glioblastomas and
melanomas. The somatic aberrations that affect PTEN
(reviewed in [17]) can occur through allelic losses leading
to either complete deletion of the PTEN locus, or point
or truncating PTEN mutations resulting in functional
inactivation. Epigenetic phenomena such as promoter
methylation can also lead to gene silencing. Further, there
are various regulators of PTEN transcription that can
both upregulate (such as Myc and p53) and downregulate
(such as NFκB) protein production, and miR-21 is the

as monotherapy in renal cell cancer (RCC) and mantle cell
lymphoma.
In RCC, a phase III trial investigated temsirolimus,
interferon or the combination of both in previously
untreated poor-prognosis patients. Those randomized to
receive the rapalog as monotherapy had a response rate
(RR) of 8.6% and a significantly longer overall survival
(OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to
the other two study arms, leading to US Food and Drug
Administration approval for this indication [40]. A further
phase III study of everolimus versus placebo in RCC where
patients had progressed on vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) receptor TKIs (sunitinib or sorafenib) was
also positive for PFS in favor of the rapalog [41]. There
was no OS benefit, however 80% of patients who initially
received placebo subsequently crossed-over to everolimus
treatment, diluting any potential effect. Additionally,
although the RR was low (1.8%), an impressive 25%
of patients remained progression free for 10 months or
greater. Temsirolimus has also been investigated in a
phase III trial of refractory mantle cell lymphoma, where
it demonstrated superior RR and PFS compared with the
control arm (investigator’s choice of therapy) [42]. The
rapalogs have been investigated as monotherapy in a host
of other phase II studies in diverse tumor types, including
neuroendocrine tumors, breast cancer, endometrial cancer
and sarcomas [43]. Encouraging single agent clinical
efficacy was observed with the use of everolimus in
pretreated patients with recurrent endometrial cancer,
where loss of PTEN expression was predictive of clinical
benefit [44].
Overall, the activity of rapalogs in a host of tumor
types where the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is frequently
activated has been disappointing. As a general rule, these
agents only inhibit the mTORC1 complex (although there
are some cellular models where disruption of mTORC2
also occurs) [10]. Therefore, there have been legitimate
concerns that there efficacy may be partly limited by a
failure to stop mTORC2 mediated phosphorylation
and activation of Akt. In addition, inhibiting mTORC1
releases the feedback inhibition mediated by the S6KIRS1-PI3K loop that normally acts to moderate pathway
activity. This can lead to a paradoxical increase in Akt
activity that can have both biological and therapeutic
implications. Indeed, increased phosphorylated Akt has
been detected in tumor biopsies from patients treated with
rapalogs [45]. Altogether, these data suggest that pathway
activation and reactivation could be avoided by PI3K, Akt
or concomitant PI3K and mTOR catalytic inhibition (that
would target both mTORC1 and mTORC2).

mutations appear to relieve the inhibitory effect that p85
has on p110, resulting in overactivity of PI3K signaling
[34,35]. Amplification of AKT is observed in a proportion
of head and neck, gastric, pancreatic and ovarian tumors,
whereas a missense mutation in the pleckstrin homology
domain of AKT1 has recently been described at low
frequency in breast, colorectal and ovarian cancers [3638].

INHIBITORS OF THE PI3K/Akt/mTOR
PATHWAY
Agents inhibiting the upstream RTKs are amongst
the most established targeted therapies in oncology. This
is particularly true for monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
directed against EGFR and HER2, both of which are
RTKs that transduce signal at least in part through PI3K.
Cetuximab (IgG1 chimeric mAb) and panitumumab
(IgG2 fully human mAb) both target the extracellular
domain of EGFR. Both are approved for use in colorectal
cancer; cetuximab is also approved in head and neck
cancers. Trastuzumab, a humanized IgG1 mAb that
inhibits HER2, is used widely in the treatment of women
with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer in both adjuvant
and metastatic settings. Small molecule tyrosine kinase
inhibitors against EGFR (gefitinib and erlotinib) and
HER2 (lapatinib, which also targets EGFR) are also
working their way into clinical use. However, here we will
focus on the evolution of inhibitors that target elements
further downstream of the RTKs in the PI3K pathway.

mTOR inhibitors – the rapalogs
As part of the mTORC1 complex, mTOR stimulates
cell growth and protein synthesis through effects on
mRNA translation and ribosome biogenesis (reviewed
in [10]). Rapamycin is a macrolide antibiotic originally
derived from Streptomyces hygroscopicus found in
the soil on the island of Rapa Nui. Rapamycin (and its
analogues, also known as rapalogs) acts by binding to
the FKBP12 binding protein, which in turn interacts with
the mTORC1 complex, inhibiting downstream signaling
[39]. Though the rapalogs trace their history back to use
as immunosuppressant drugs used in transplant medicine,
their antiproliferative effects led to investigation of their
use as anti-cancer agents. The other rapalogs, synthetic
derivatives of rapamycin with improved properties,
are temsirolimus (CCI-779; Wyeth, Madison, NJ, US),
everolimus (RAD001; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) and
ridaforolimus (AP23573, formerly known as deforolimus;
Merck & Co., Whitehouse Station, NJ, US).
Despite the high expectation for their application in
oncology based on sound rationale related to the presumed
mechanism-of-action, the rapalogs have only met with
modest success. Most notable is the utility of these agents

PI3K inhibitors
A series of compounds are currently passing through
the early phases of clinical development (summarized
in table 1). ‘Pure’ PI3K inhibitors target only p110;
533

Oncotarget 2010; 1: 530 - 543

both pan-p110 inhibitors and isoform-specific inhibitors
exist. As the catalytic domains of the p110 subunits and
mTOR are structurally similar, dual inhibitors of both
PI3K and mTOR and are also emerging. These dual
inhibitors suppress mTOR in both the mTORC1 and
mTORC2 complexes, distinct from the rapalogs. With
few exceptions, these agents act in an ATP-competitive
and reversible manner.
The first generation PI3K inhibitors were
Wortmannin and LY294002. Wortmannin is a fungal
metabolite initially isolated from Penicillium wortmanni
in 1957. LY294002, about 500 times less potent and first
produced about 25 years ago, is a synthetic compound

derived from quercetin, a broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor
[46]. Both agents achieve significant growth inhibition
across a broad spectrum of cancer cell lines especially in
circumstances of excess PI3K activity. However, neither
Wortmannin nor LY294002 have progressed to clinical
trials due to unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties,
poor selectivity and toxicity concerns [47]. Regardless,
their use has led to a greater understanding of the PI3K
pathway and has spawned a new generation of inhibitors
that overcome some of the failings of these compounds
(summarized in table 1).

Dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitors

demonstrated stable disease in 12 patients for 16 weeks or
more and in 7 patients for 24 weeks or more (of a total of
83 enrolled patients) [54]. The most frequently observed
toxicities involved elevated liver enzymes, gastrointestinal
complaints and rash. The MTD has been defined as 50mg
twice daily or 90mg daily.
GDC-0980 (Genetech, South San Francisco, CA,
USA), also a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, is under evaluation in
a phase I clinical study of patients with solid tumors [55].
Though the study is in its earlier stages compared to those
above, initial results show it to be well tolerated with no
DLTs, and some suggestions of anti-tumor activity.
Other dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitors in clinical
development include the orally administered PF04691502 (Pfizer, New York, NY, US), and an intravenous
agent, PKI-587 or PF-05212384 (Pfizer, New York, NY,
US). Based on preclinical studies, phase I clinical trials
are underway to assess safety and tolerability of these
drugs in cancer patients with solid tumors [56,57].

As mentioned, agents of this class target all catalytic
isoforms of PI3K together with mTORC1 and mTORC2.
This has the theoretical advantage of more completely
shutting down the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway but also the
possible drawback of greater toxicity.
SF1126 (Semafore Pharmaceuticals, Indianapolis,
IN, US) is a small molecule prodrug of LY294002 that
is conjugated to an integrin-binding component. This
design enhances delivery to the tumor and its associated
vasculature where cleavage leads to release of the active
drug. It has shown significant anti-tumor effects in
xenograft models of solid tumors including glioblastoma,
breast and prostate cancer, and potent anti-angiogenic
activity has also been observed, felt partly to be related
to a reduction in HIF-1α levels [48]. A phase I trial of
patients with solid tumors is ongoing. No maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) has been found, but the maximum
administered dose (MAD) has been declared at 1110mg/
m2 as intravenous administration. The most frequent
adverse events were gastrointestinal complaints, fever
and fatigue; there were no clinically significant effects on
glucose or insulin levels. No responses were observed, but
19 of 38 evaluable patients (50%) showed stable disease
as best response, for a median of 13 weeks and a mean of
18 weeks [49].
Two dual inhibitors are under investigation by
Novartis (Basel, Switzerland) – NVP-BEZ235 and NVPBGT226 (there is currently no presented or published
data relating to NVP-BGT226). NVP-BEZ235 is
an orally available product belonging to the class of
imidazoquinolines [50]. Preclinical studies demonstrated
anti-proliferative activity against a wide range of cancer
cell lines, including HER2-overexpressing breast cancer
models of trastuzumab and lapatinib resistance [51,52].
Further, tumor growth suppression has been shown in
PI3K mutated xenograft models of human cancer. First
data from the phase I clinical trial of NVP-BEZ235
was presented at the 46th American Society of Clinical
Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting (2010) [53]. No DLTs
have been observed in the first 59 treated patients. Of the
51 evaluable patients, two achieved a partial response –
an estrogen receptor (ER) positive, HER2 negative breast
cancer patient with unknown PI3K pathway status; and
a patient with Cowden’s syndrome (germline PTEN
mutation) who had developed lung cancer. A further 14
patients (27%) achieved stable disease for 4 months or
greater.
XL765 (Exelixis, South San Francisco, CA, US),
also known as SAR245409, is another dual inhibitor.
Tumor stabilization or shrinkage has been observed
with XL765 in a variety of mouse xenograft models of
human cancer, including breast, ovary, lung, prostate
and brain cancers. Updated clinical data from the phase
I monotherapy study in patients with solid tumors has

Pure PI3K inhibitors
The majority of compounds described as pure PI3K
inhibitors are pan-p110 inhibitors. However, at least one
isoform-specific inhibitor (CAL-101) has had preliminary
results presented.
NVP-BKM120 (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) is
one such agent, and preclinical data showed anti-tumor
activity in xenograft models of human cancer both with
and without PI3K/PTEN mutations [58,59]. Preliminary
results from the phase I study of NVP-BKM120 in patients
with solid tumors were also presented at the 46th ASCO
annual meeting [60]. Interestingly, though hyperglycemia
has been an anticipated adverse event when using agents
that inhibit the PI3K pathway due to its influence on
cellular metabolism and insulin/glucose regulation,
NVP-BKM120 is the only inhibitor in clinical trials that
has encountered clinically relevant elevations in plasma
glucose. Indeed, hyperglycemia was a DLT, as was mood
alteration and rash. The MTD was identified as 100mg
daily. Of the 31 evaluable patients, there were two partial
responses. Both were in women with breast cancer – one
had a triple negative breast cancer (ER and progesterone
receptor (PR) negative, HER2 negative) that was PIK3CA
wild type, without PTEN loss and KRAS mutant; and the
other had a ER/PR positive, HER2 negative tumor with a
confirmed PIK3CA mutation (E545K). Additionally, 20%
of patients remained on study for at least 8 months.
XL147 (Exelixis, South San Francisco, CA, US),
also known as SAR245408, is another pan-p110 inhibitor.
It has shown preclinical activity in a variety of xenograft
models of human cancer, including those of breast, lung
and prostate cancer. Initial data from the first 60 patients
treated with this agent as monotherapy in a phase I study
was presented at the same ASCO meeting [61]. Rash
was the DLT, setting the MTD at 600mg on either an

intermittent (21 out of 28 days) or continuous daily dosing
schedules, with fatigue, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea
also attributable to the drug. Of the patients evaluable
for response, there was a partial response in a non-PI3K/
PTEN mutated non-small cell lung cancer patient, and
19% of patients continued on treatment for a minimum
of 16 weeks.
The semisynthetic wortmannin derivative PX-866
(Oncothyreon, Seattle, WA, US), also a pan-isoform
inhibitor of class I PI3Ks, differs from other agents
targeting PI3K in that it covalently binds to the ATPbinding site of p110 and is thus irreversible. In vivo studies
demonstrate that PIK3CA mutant or PTEN null xenografts
were sensitive to treatment with PX-866 [62]. Final results
from 60 patients treated on the phase I study of PX-866
have been presented [63]. The MTD was defined as 8mg
and 12mg on the continuous and intermittent schedules,
respectively, with DLTs of diarrhea and elevated liver
enzymes. Nausea, vomiting and fatigue were also amongst
the more common adverse events seen. No responses were
seen amongst the 53 evaluable patients, but 25% of these
heavily pretreated patients achieved stable disease for a
median of 57 days.
PI103 was one of the earlier new generation PI3K
inhibitors that showed proof-of-concept whereby targeting
members of the PI3K family with high selectivity was
able to achieve target modulation with resultant in vivo
antitumor activity [64]. Its rapid metabolism precluded
clinical development, but proved a valuable tool that
ultimately led to development of GDC-0941 (Piramed/
Genentech, Slough, United Kingdom/South San Francisco,
CA, US) another pan-isoform class I PI3K inhibitor. This
derivative of thieno[3,2-d]pyrimidine has demonstrated
tumor growth inhibition in xenograft models including
those harboring mutations in PI3K or PTEN [65]. In a
phase I study of GDC-0941 administered as monotherapy,
the most frequently reported drug-related adverse events
were mild or moderate nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, and
dysgeusia [66]. The three DLTs reported were headache,
pleural effusion and decreased lung diffusion capacity.
One partial response has been observed in a breast cancer
patient, and encouraging activity has also been seen in
patients with ovarian cancer.
Finally, there has been interest in developing isoformspecific inhibitors as it may permit more complete target
inhibition with a more tolerable adverse effect profile.
The most advanced is a p110δ-specific inhibitor – CAL101 (Calistoga Pharmaceuticals, Seattle, WA, US). The
p110δ isoform is expressed predominantly in leukocytes,
and preclinical work showed it to be efficacious in
lymphoma and leukemia cells and promoted apoptosis
[67]. Accordingly, 106 patients with chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL), different types of non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma (NHL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and
multiple myeloma (MM) have been enrolled thus far into
a phase I study of CAL-101 [68]. Reversible increases
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in liver enzymes and pneumonia have been the most
frequent treatment emergent adverse events, although
there was minimal hematological toxicity. Impressively,
partial responses have been seen in 13 of 23 patients
(57%) with indolent forms of NHL, 8 of 12 patients (67%)
with mantle cell lymphoma and 10 of 30 patients (33%)
with CLL.

Akt inhibitors
Direct inhibition of the serine/threonine kinase Akt
provides another avenue to pharmacologically regulate
activity of the PI3K pathway. The two strategies being
explored involves agents that compete for the ATPbinding site (ATP mimetics) and those that act away
from this catalytic site (allosteric inhibitors). As is the
case with PI3K inhibitors, there is some expectation that
tumors harboring mutations or amplifications of Akt, or
increased pathway activity, will show greater sensitivity
to Akt inhibitors. However, as with the rapalogs, the
release of feedback inhibition consequent to targeting Akt
may enhance the activity of non-Akt effectors of PI3K
signaling. Further, these non-Akt dependent effectors of
PI3K signaling, such as SGK3, can promote cancer in
the presence of PIK3CA mutations [69]. Despite these
findings, a recent study demonstrated that a noncatalytic
site Akt inhibitor was effective against breast cancer cell
lines with PIK3CA mutations and HER2 amplifications
[70]. In addition, another study demonstrated that tumors
with PIK3CA mutations were the most sensitive to an Akt
plekstrin homology (PH) domain inhibitor, and KRAS
mutant tumors were the least sensitive [71].
Perifosine (Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, New York,
NY, US) is an allosteric inhibitor that targets the PH
domain of Akt, thereby preventing its translocation to the
plasma membrane required for activation [72]. It exerts
Akt-dependent and Akt-independent effects, and although
many preclinical studies have documented Akt inhibition
by perifosine, clinical validation of these findings is
lacking [73]. Perifosine has been evaluated in a host of
phase I/II clinical trials both as monotherapy and in
combination with various other agents. The most common
adverse reactions are fatigue and gastrointestinal toxicity.
The latter led to frequent treatment discontinuation;
alterations to the dosing schedule helped rectify this
problem [74]. Single-agent activity with perifosine has
generally been disappointing, although activity has been
observed in patients with sarcoma and Waldenström’s
macroglobulinemia [75,76].
MK-2206 (Merck & Co., Whitehouse Station, NJ,
US) is another allosteric Akt inhibitor. In preclinical
studies, synergism has been demonstrated when MK2206 has been used in combination with other targeted
therapies (erlotinib, lapatinib) or a host of cytotoxic agents
[77]. Preliminary results of a phase I study in solid tumors
have been presented [78]. The MTD has been defined
536

as 60mg and 200mg on the daily and weekly schedules,
respectively. DLT was rash, with other common side effects
being fatigue and gastrointestinal complaints. No patient
achieved a partial response, although tumor shrinkage
of up to 23% was seen in several patients, especially
those with pancreatic cancer (both adenocarcinoma and
neuroendocrine histologies).
GSK690693 (GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, UK) is a
potent ATP-competitive Akt inhibitor that also inhibits the

phosphorylation of the downstream target GSK3 in cells.
It is currently in clinical development as an intravenous
agent for use in patients with solid tumors or hematological
malignancies.

phase I first-in-human trials in cancer patients include

preliminary PD outcomes have been reported, diminution
in pathway readouts has been observed, giving reassurance
that the target is being hit. For example, the XL765 and
XL147 studies had an extensive biomarker component.
Results have shown reduced activation of key pathway
nodes in the order of 50-90% in both tumor and nontumor tissue [54,61]. However, this does not necessarily
equate with meaningful clinical benefits. Regardless,
translational research requires biomarker studies to
further knowledge and to assist in finding solutions to
clinical problems or disappointments, and often raises
new questions of interest. Indeed, the reduction in pERK
(a marker of MAPK pathway activity) noted in tumors of
patients treated with XL765 and XL147 was unexpected,
raising the possibility of hitherto unrecognized crosstalk
between the PI3K and MAPK pathways [54,61].
At present, an important concern is that many
biomarker assays have been neither standardized nor
validated. They add to the cost of the trial and may involve
invasive procedures that carry a degree of risk to the
patient. Evaluation of PTEN status is a prime example.
Because functional PTEN loss can occur through a variety
of mechanisms, detection of PTEN protein expression by
immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tumor samples is the
preferred method. However, the antibodies used to stain
samples are not uniform between laboratories, nor has
a definitive cut-off been defined below which PTEN is
considered to be lost. Further, the adequacy of archival
compared to fresh tissue has not been delineated. And
given that tumor samples are often small and difficult to
obtain, how biomarker studies ought to be prioritized is
not clear.
One solution is to find adequate surrogate markers.
Imaging modalities provide an option. Patients on the
NVP-BKM120 trial underwent FDG-PET scans. Reduced
PET avidity in was seen in lesions of most patients [60].
This seems encouraging, but whether it represents true anticancer activity or merely the impact that PI3K inhibition
has on glucose homeostasis remains to be seen. Biomarkers
detectable in peripheral blood have the advantage of being
minimally invasive and accessible for repeat samples.
Mechanism-based toxicities of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors
that could potentially be used as PD biomarkers include
hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia [83]. The NVPBZ235 and BKM-120 trials found an increase in plasma
C-peptide levels following treatment as a surrogate for
the insulin resistance anticipated from pathway inhibition
[53,60]. Also, a reduction in pAkt was seen in platelet-rich
plasma obtained from patients treated with GDC-0980
[55]. These are promising examples, but require further
analysis. Regardless, provided biomarker studies are
employed with careful forethought and selectivity, their
place in clinical trials is justified.

CA, US), and LY2780301 (Eli Lilly and Company,
Indianapolis, IN, US).

mTOR kinase inhibitors
A new variety of mTOR inhibitor has recently
emerged. They are ATP-competitive inhibitors and thus
target the kinase domain of mTOR, repressing both
mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity. Therefore, they share
more in common with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors
than the rapalogs in terms of their mechanism-of-action. In
turn, this should mitigate the paradoxical PI3K activation
consequent to de-repression of the negative feedback
seen with rapalogs. Despite this advantage, interesting
preclinical data of two such agents (PP242 and PP30)
suggests that they have more substantial antiproliferative
actions than rapamycin not because of the mTORC2
effects but rather because they are more effective in
suppressing mTORC1 [79]. Other agents in this group
include WAY-600, WYE-687, and WYE-354, the latter of
which has displayed robust antitumor activity in PTENnull tumor xenografts [80].
AZD8055 (Astra Zeneca, London, UK), OSI-027
(OSI Pharmaceuticals, Melville, NY, US) and INK128
(Intellikine, La Jolla, CA, US) are the first mTOR kinase
inhibitors to enter clinical trials [81]. Preliminary data
from a phase I trial of OSI-027 was presented at the 46th
ASCO annual meeting [82]. Only 43 patients have been
treated across 3 dosing schedules thus far. DLTs of fatigue
and a decrease in cardiac left ventricular ejection fraction
have been noted, but the most common side effects have
been fatigue, anorexia and nausea. Stable disease has been
the best response to date, although tumor shrinkage has
been seen in a patient with colorectal cancer and another
with a parotid adenoidcystic cancer.

BIOMARKERS
Biomarker studies are becoming increasingly
incorporated into early phase clinical trials. This is
largely true for the phase I trials of PI3K pathway
inhibitors described above where various predictive
and pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers have been
explored. PD biomarkers are markers of drug effect that
assess for target inhibition and pathway downregulation.
They necessitate assessment prior to and following an
intervention to detect a change from baseline; a correlation
with clinical activity is not implied but is desirable. A
number of different biological tissues have been acquired
from patients on these trials in order to perform these
biomarker studies (summarized in table 2). Predictive
biomarkers predict the efficacy (or lack thereof) of a
particular treatment in a given clinical scenario (discussed
below).
In the clinical trials of PI3K inhibitors where

The preliminary clinical data from phase I trials
presented to date have not demonstrated significant
response rates with any of the inhibitors when employed
as single agent therapy. The potential reasons for this
finding include poor patient selection, inadequate dosing
schedules, and resistance mechanisms.
Regarding patient selection, strong preclinical
work has suggested that those patients whose tumors
harbor genetic aberrations that result in increased PI3K
pathway activity should be most sensitive to these agents
[52,62,70,84]. Indeed, many of the clinical studies have
retrospectively analyzed pathway genetics sourced from
archival or fresh tumor tissue (in particular, but not
restricted to, PTEN and PIK3CA status). However, the

mutations have not responded to monotherapy. In addition,
the few confirmed clinical responses seen have occurred
in both those with and those without PI3K pathway
activating mutations. Nonetheless, it seems a reasonable
strategy to enrich patient populations with those harboring
such genetic changes and prospective analysis of these
potential predictive biomarkers should be employed.
A second area of contention relates to dosing
schedules. PD biomarker studies have shown robust PI3K
pathway inhibition following treatment but complete
pathway shutdown is not achieved. There is ongoing
discussion regarding whether this is an inadequate
strategy. Intermittent dosing schedules employing higher
doses for shorter durations (thus potentially minimizing
the risk of cumulative toxicity) may boost the clinical

mutations of PI3K. Irrespective, investigators are devising
and employing new strategies to enhance outcomes, in
particular by enriching patient populations and testing a
multitude of drug combinations based on sound rationale.
In addition, agents targeting other components of the
pathway are under development. These include PDK1
inhibitors (to prevent AktT308 phosphorylation and nonPI3K dependent phosphorylation of other kinases that can
promote cancer progression), SHIP agonists (to promote
PIP3 degradation), and heat shock protein inhibitors (Akt
is a client protein of the molecular chaperone). Given
the importance of the PI3K pathway in the malignant
phenotype, further optimization of the clinical use of
these new compounds in the coming years is warranted
and should lead to better patient outcomes.

outcomes if 100% pathway inhibition can be attained.
A third strategy that is well underway is the use of
drug combinations. Signaling pathways in human cancer
are complex. Frequent cross-talk and feedback loops
add to complexity and promote avenues for resistance.
Except for the relatively uncommon scenario of genuine
oncogenic addiction, it seems unlikely that blocking a
single pathway will be sufficient to switch off the drive
for malignant growth and progression in a tumor. There
is much optimism that use of rationale drug combinations
should overcome some of these deficiencies. This
could imply any of the drug classes described here coadministered with either targeted therapies against RTKs,
key nodes in parallel pathways, or cytotoxic agents.
The rapalogs have shown early encouraging data.
PI3K pathway activation has been found to lead to
resistance to trastuzumab in HER2-overexpressing breast
cancer [52]. Accordingly, studies have investigated adding
everolimus to trastuzumab and paclitaxel in women
with prior resistance to the latter two agents. Confirmed
partial responses were seen in 20% of subjects and
stable disease in a further 56% in a phase II study [85].
The same strategy has been evaluated in a phase I trial
of everolimus, trastuzumab and vinorelbine, achieving a
disease control rate of 80% (37 of 46 evaluable patients)
[86]. The combination of a rapalog (ridaforolimus)
and a monoclonal antibody targeting the IGF1-R
(dalotuzumab, MK-0646) has been studied in a phase I
trial of patients with solid tumors [87]. Stomatitis was the
DLT. Importantly, partial responses were seen in 6 of 62
patients (10%), despite the relatively poor response rates
of either agent as monotherapy, supporting the notion
that combinations can lead to better outcomes. There are
many more combinations with rapalogs currently under
evaluation.
Amongst the PI3K pathway inhibitors, a host of
phase I studies evaluating combination strategies are
underway. As seen in table 3, co-administration with
either molecular targeted therapies, as well as cytotoxic
agents, is being evaluated. Finally, there is some evidence
showing that inhibition of the PI3K pathway can lead
to hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway, and hence
combinations of PI3K inhibitors and MEK inhibitors may
be a promising therapeutic strategy.
