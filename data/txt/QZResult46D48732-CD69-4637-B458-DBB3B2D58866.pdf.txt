Abstract
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) has long been recognized
as the major proliferative and functional stimulus for thyroid
follicular cells. TSH receptor (TSHR) engagement stimulates
the production of cyclic AMP and the subsequent activation of
downstream effector molecules, including protein kinase A,
S6K1, and Rap1, whereas the role of the RAS and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase signaling cascades downstream of TSHR
is still controversial. Despite the abundance of candidates, it is
still unclear which of these pathways represent(s) the key
mitogenic output of TSH-initiated signaling. We have used an
in vivo model of goitrogenesis to dissect the contribution of
these pathways to TSH-induced thyrocyte proliferation and
thyroid hyperplasia. We show that the in vivo proliferative
response to chronic TSHR stimulation relies heavily on the
activation of the mTOR/S6K1 axis, and that mTOR inhibition
during goitrogenic stimulation abrogates the hyperplastic but
not the hypertrophic thyrocyte responses to TSH, thus
functionally uncoupling these two processes. Strikingly,
goitrogenesis was not associated with an increase in AKT
phosphorylation levels, underlining the existence of an AKTindependent pathway leading to mTOR activation upon TSH
stimulation. [Cancer Res 2007;67(17):8002–6]

Introduction
Thyroid function and proliferation are primarily induced by the
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH is secreted by the
pituitary and its levels are regulated by the thyroid hormones
through a negative feedback mechanism. TSH binding to its
receptor (TSHR) activates the Gas/adenylate cyclase/cyclic AMP
(cAMP) cascade, leading to both the induction of cell cycle
progression and the expression of differentiation markers (1).
Identification of the crucial nodes of the signaling cascades
involved in thyrocyte proliferation is essential to understand the
pathogenetic mechanisms of thyroid proliferative disorders, from
simple goiter to thyroid carcinoma. Most data on the mitogenic
pathways activated by TSH have been obtained in cell cultures
from rat, dog, and human thyroids. In addition to some common
themes, however, a number of contrasting results have been
obtained, so that several open questions still remain (2).
The notion that TSH mitogenic signals are funneled through the
cAMP pathway is supported by the fact that cAMP enhancers such
as forskolin and cholera toxin reproduce the effects of TSH on cell

proliferation in dog primary thyrocytes (3), and by mouse models
based on the activation of the TSHR/cAMP cascade (4), suggesting
that the activity of protein kinase A (PKA) is absolutely required for
the mitogenic stimulation by TSH. Likely candidates to transduce
these mitogenic signals include the cAMP-responsive element
binding protein (CREB; ref. 5), p70S6K (6), and the small GTPase
Rap1 (7). However, microinjection of Rap1 failed to induce
proliferation of dog thyrocytes, showing that Rap1 alone is not
sufficient to trigger thyroid cell growth (8).
The role of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) in the TSHinduced mitogenic cascade is still unclear: whereas rat thyroid cells
in culture seem to require PI3K activation downstream of TSH
stimulation for proliferation (2), cAMP and PKA cannot activate
PI3K or AKT in dog primary thyrocytes, a system in which the
PI3K/AKT pathway does not seem to be involved in TSH-mediated
thyrocyte proliferation (9). We have recently shown that constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt cascade conveys a major
proliferative signal in vivo in thyroid follicular cells (10). However,
the relationship between this cascade and the signaling events
downstream of TSHR activation still needs to be defined.
To elucidate the in vivo pathways that are activated by TSH
during the induction of thyroid proliferation, we have used a wellestablished mouse model of chronic TSH stimulation. We provide
strong evidence that the major TSH-generated mitogenic stimulus
is conveyed through the mTOR kinase, but does not require AKT
activation.

Materials and Methods
Animals and treatments. 129Sv mice were bred in the Fox Chase
Cancer Center Laboratory Animal Facility. Hypothyroidism was induced at
4 to 6 weeks of age by the administration of 0.5% sodium perchlorate and
0.05% methimazole (both from Sigma), given in the drinking water for
5 days or 2 weeks. RAD001 [Everolimus; kindly provided by Dr. Heidi Lane
(Novartis, Basel, Switzerland)], was administered daily by oral gavage at a
dose of 10 mg/kg body weight. At the end of experiments, mice were
euthanized and weighed. The thyroid was dissected and weighed; one lobe
was fixed for pathologic analysis, and the other was frozen in liquid
nitrogen for protein extraction. Experiments were repeated thrice.
Primary thyrocyte culture. Thyroids were dissected from 8-week-old
mice and collected in 1 mL of Ham’s F12 with 100 units/mL of type I
collagenase (Sigma) and 1 unit/mL of dispase (Roche). Enzymatic digestion
was carried out for 90 min at 37jC. After digestion, isolated follicles were
washed thrice with culture medium (Ham’s F12 containing 40% Nu-Serum
IV; Collaborative Biomedical), seeded in a 12-well plate, and grown for
4 days. At day 4, the cells were switched to 4% Nu-Serum IV for 2 days. At
day 6, cells were pretreated with vehicle or 20 Amol/L of RAD001 for 20 min
and then stimulated with 2 mU/mL of TSH (Sigma) for 20 min, washed and
lysed for Western blot analysis.
Immunohistochemical analysis. The following antibodies were used:
rabbit polyclonal against Ki-67 (Vector Laboratories), rabbit monoclonal
(immunohistochemistry-specific) against pAKT (Ser473) and pS6 (Ser235/236;

Chronic TSH stimulation activates S6K1 in vivo. To identify
the pathways that are effectively involved in the control of
thyrocyte proliferation during prolonged TSH stimulation, we
analyzed the activation status of candidate targets in the thyroids
of age- and sex-matched wild-type mice that had been treated for
2 weeks with the goitrogenic compounds methimazole and sodium
perchlorate (10).
The phosphorylation (and thus activation) of p44/42 mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) was not altered by TSH
stimulation, whereas, unexpectedly, the phosphorylation of CREB,
an important downstream target of PKA, was severely reduced in
goitrogen-treated mice, suggesting that proliferation upon chronic
TSH exposure does not rely on signaling through these molecules
(Fig. 1A). On the contrary, S6K1 phosphorylation was increased in
TSH-exposed thyroids, and its functional activation was confirmed
by the massive phosphorylation of one of its targets, ribosomal
protein S6, as detected by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1A and B).
Thus, S6K1 might play an active role in the proliferation of thyroid
follicular cells upon prolonged TSH stimulation.
TSH-induced hyperplasia is mediated by mTOR. Because
S6K1 activation is primarily dependent on the mTOR kinase, we
hypothesized that TSHR engagement might induce proliferation
through the activation of the mTOR/S6K1 cascade.

of phosphorylated, active forms of AKT and S6 in the four treatment groups. Inset, a positive control for pAKT, represented by thyroid follicles with tissue-specific
Pten inactivation.

To address this possibility, we treated cohorts of 6-week-old mice
(n = 5–7) with goitrogens alone or in combination with the
rapamycin derivative RAD001 (Everolimus), a specific inhibitor of
mTOR, for 5 and 14 days. As expected, the thyroid weight of
goitrogen-treated mice doubled over the 2-week treatment period.
Histologic analysis revealed that the thyrocytes had lost their flat
morphology and acquired hypertrophic, columnar features (Fig. 2A
and B). RAD001 treatment alone, on the other hand, did not have
any obvious effect on the thyroid size or histologic features (Fig. 2A
and B). Combined treatment with goitrogens and RAD001 resulted
in only a minor reduction of the thyroid weight, and the
morphologic features of the glands were indistinguishable from
those of mice treated only with goitrogens, suggesting that the
TSH-induced hypertrophy does not rely on mTOR activation
(Fig. 2A and B).
We then used Ki-67 immunostaining to measure the proliferation of the thyroid follicular cells. Control thyrocytes were
characterized, as expected, by an extremely low proliferative index,
which was not altered by RAD001 treatment (Fig. 2C). Goitrogenic
treatment significantly and progressively increased the number of
proliferating thyrocytes (>13-fold increase at 14 days). Strikingly,
the combined treatment with goitrogens and RAD001 drastically
reduced the proliferative index, almost to control levels, at both
time points. These results strongly suggest that a large part of the
TSH-induced mitogenic signal is funneled through the mTOR
pathway.
mTOR activation occurs independent of AKT. Activation of
mTOR upon mitogenic stimuli is usually thought to be mediated by
the AKT-dependent inhibition of TSC1/TSC2 complexes, and the
subsequent activation of Rheb. In fact, TSH-dependent AKT
activation has been shown in some (but not all) cell culture
models of thyroid proliferation (9, 11, 12). At the same time, mTOR
activation results in the phosphorylation of the S6 ribosomal
protein, through the ability of mTOR to directly activate S6K1.
Therefore, we used immunohistochemistry on thyroid sections
from the four cohorts of mice to detect AKT phosphorylation on
Ser473 and S6 phosphorylation on Ser235/236. S6 was heavily
phosphorylated upon goitrogen exposure, thus further proving
the direct involvement of the mTOR cascade downstream of TSH,

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (17). September 1, 2007

and RAD001 treatment completely reverted S6 phosphorylation
(Fig. 3). However, and rather surprisingly, no change was detected
in the activation of AKT (Fig. 3).
To further analyze this proliferation-inducing signaling cascade
activated by chronic TSH stimulation in vivo in the thyroid gland,
we did Western blot analysis using antibodies against specific
phosphorylation sites of relevant proteins in the AKT/mTOR/S6K
pathway. mTOR activation upon in vivo TSH stimulation was once
again shown by the phosphorylation of S6K1 on Thr389 and Thr421/
Ser424 upon goitrogen treatment, which was totally abrogated by
simultaneous RAD001 administration (Fig. 4A). Along the same
line, ribosomal protein S6 was phosphorylated on Ser235/236 in
goitrogen-treated thyroid extracts, but not in extracts from
goitrogen plus RAD001-treated mice. However, phosphorylation
of TSC2 on Thr1462 (an AKT target site), of AKT on Ser473 and
Thr308, and of ERK1/2 on Thr202 and Tyr204, did not change upon
any treatment, strongly suggesting that mTOR activation takes
place independent of AKT or MAPK activation (Fig. 4A).
Finally, we did Western blot analysis on primary cultures from
8-week-old mice grown in reduced serum for 48 h and stimulated
with TSH for 20 min (Fig. 4B). As in the in vivo system, TSH
induced the phosphorylation of S6K1 on Thr421/Ser424, which was
abolished by pretreatment with RAD001, but not the activation of
AKT, as measured by the phosphorylation on Ser473. These data
fully support our hypothesis that mTOR activation upon TSHR
engagement is independent of AKT activation.

Discussion
The relative contribution of the different TSH-initiated cascades
to the various aspects of thyroid physiology, differentiation, and
growth is still largely unknown. Our data, obtained in vivo in a
relevant model of thyroid proliferation under sustained TSH
stimulation, support a novel picture in which the proliferative
input upon TSH signaling is conveyed through the mTOR kinase. In
fact, we show that continuous TSH stimulation, during a time
window known to result in simultaneous continuous thyrocyte
proliferation and gland hypertrophy (13), does not lead to MAPK
activation or to activation of the CREB transcription factor, but

rather results in CREB down-regulation. This latter finding is
similar to the differential response of CREB phosphorylation in the
mouse nucleus accumbens upon acute and chronic nicotine
exposure (14), and might reflect a negative feedback mechanism
consequent to chronic TSHR/PKA stimulation, as previously shown
in human toxic adenomas (15).
Strikingly, our data show that it is the mTOR/S6K1/S6 axis that
becomes hyperactive during chronic TSH stimulation, as detected
using phosphorylation-specific antibodies. Furthermore, specific
inhibition of mTOR activity through the rapamycin analogue
RAD001 abolishes the phosphorylation of both S6K1 and its target
ribosomal protein S6, simultaneously restoring virtually normal
proliferation levels. These data unequivocally show the key role of
mTOR in inducing thyrocyte proliferation downstream of TSHR.
The involvement of S6K1 in TSH-dependent proliferation had been
previously suggested by studies in dog and rat thyrocytes (6, 9),
although the mechanisms of S6K1 activation downstream of TSH
had not been defined.
Our data not only uncovers, for the first time, the essential role
this cascade plays in thyroid proliferation in vivo, but also allows
the uncoupling of two major TSH effects, the hypertrophic
response of the thyroid follicles, and the burst of thyrocyte
proliferation. Although the latter is almost completely under the
control of mTOR signaling, likely through the increased translation
of molecules such as cyclin D1 (16) and cyclin D3 (17), the
hypertrophic response to TSH, in terms of both thyroid weight and
cellular morphology, is virtually unchanged upon RAD001 treatment, strongly suggesting that pathways different from the mTOR
cascade are responsible for the thyrocyte shape and size changes.
This view is also supported by the notion that the hyperproliferative effects of chronic TSH exposure, in vivo, fade away
after 2 to 3 weeks, whereas the hypertrophy persists for at least
14 weeks (13).
The major open question stemming from our findings, however,
relates to the mechanisms involved in the TSH-dependent mTOR
activation. The ‘‘classic’’ mechanism of mTOR activation upon
growth factor receptor signaling relies on the AKT-mediated
inhibition of TSC1/TSC2, which in turn, allows Rheb to activate
mTOR. Our data, quite surprisingly, shows that AKT is not part of
this pathway during chronic TSH exposure. We could not, in fact,
show any changes in AKT phosphorylation at the two canonical

www.aacrjournals.org

activation sites under goitrogen exposure and under RAD001mediated mTOR inhibition. These in vivo data support previous
findings from in vitro models, in which TSH was not able to induce
AKT phosphorylation in dog primary thyrocytes (9) and in rat
FRTL-5 cells (12), but are in sharp contrast with the rat WRT cell
model, in which AKT phosphorylation is induced by TSH exposure
(11). Although species-specific differences have often been invoked
to justify these discrepancies, we cannot exclude the possibility
that some molecular characteristics of the in vitro systems may not
faithfully reproduce the physiology of the thyroid response to TSH
in vivo.
AKT-independent activation of mTOR is becoming increasingly
recognized as a mechanism of control of cell proliferation. For
example, it has been recently shown that prostaglandin F2a
activates mTOR via MAPK, but not via AKT in luteal cells (18),
whereas mTOR activation, independent of both AKT and MAPK,
has been detected in B lymphocytes (19) and endometrial stromal
cells (20). The dissection of the specific mechanisms involved in the
TSH-dependent activation of mTOR is tightly linked to the
identification of the key players downstream of TSHR, and those
upstream of mTOR. The major limitation of our in vivo approach is
represented by the impossibility to directly measure Rheb
activation, thus precluding the identification of the exact point at
which the TSHR signaling cascade intersects the mTOR-activating
pathway. Primary ex vivo thyrocyte culture systems will be
necessary to work out the details of the connection between TSHR
engagement and mTOR activation.
In summary, our studies have defined the mTOR kinase as a
critical effector of the proliferative signals initiated by TSH,
through a mechanism that does not require activation of AKT
and is independent of the hypertrophic effects of TSH in the
thyroid follicular cells.
