Abstract

Author Manuscript

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a phosphoinositide 3-kinase related protein kinase,
controls cell growth in response to nutrients and growth factors and is frequently deregulated in
cancer. Here we report co-crystal structures of a truncated mTOR-mLST8 complex with an ATP
transition state mimic and with ATP-site inhibitors. The structures reveal an intrinsically active
kinase conformation, with catalytic residues and mechanism remarkably similar to canonical
protein kinases. The active site is highly recessed due to the FKBP12-Rapamycin binding (FRB)
domain and an inhibitory helix protruding from the catalytic cleft. mTOR activating mutations
map to the structural framework that holds these elements in place, indicating the kinase is
controlled by restricted access. In vitro biochemistry indicates that the FRB domain acts as a
gatekeeper, with its rapamycin-binding site interacting with substrates to grant them access to the
restricted active site. FKBP12-rapamycin inhibits by directly blocking substrate recruitment and
by further restricting active site access. The structures also reveal active site residues and
conformational changes that underlie inhibitor potency and specificity.

The mTOR pathway controls cell growth in response to energy, nutrients, growth factors
and other environmental cues, and it figures prominently in cancer1,2. Central to the pathway
is the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein that belongs to the phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K)-related protein kinase (PIKK) family3. mTOR assembles into two
complexes with distinct inputs and downstream effects. mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) is
defined by its RAPTOR subunit4-6, which is replaced by RICTOR in mTORC26,7. Both

subunits that interact with RAPTOR or RICTOR1.

mTORC1 regulates cell growth by promoting translation, ribosome biogenesis and
autophagy1,4,5. Its activation requires nutrients and amino acids, which result in the
RAPTOR-mediated recruitment of mTORC1 to lysosomes and late endosomes10,11, and colocalization with its activator, the small GTPase RHEB12,13. Proposed mechanisms of
RHEB action include binding to and activating the mTOR kinase domain14, and the
displacement of the mTORC1 inhibitor PRAS40 from RAPTOR15,16. RHEB in turn is
negatively-regulated by the GTPase-activating domain of the TSC2 tumor suppressor, which
relays signals from multiple growth factor and stress pathways17. mTORC1 substrates
include the eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) and ribosomal S6 kinases (S6K), which
control cap-dependent translation initiation and elongation, respectively18. Phosphorylation
of 4EBP1 and S6K1 is dependent on their Tor Signaling Sequence (TOS) motif19,20 that
binds to RAPTOR, and which is also present in the negative regulator PRAS4021,22.
mTORC2 responds primarily to growth factors, promoting cell-cycle entry, cell survival,
actin cytoskeleton polarization, and anabolic output6,7,23. Its substrates include the Ser/Thr
protein kinases AKT, SGK and PKC, which share the hydrophobic motif (HM)
phosphorylation site with S6K11,2.

Rapamycin, which forms a ternary complex with the FK506-binding protein12 (FKBP12)
and the FRB (FKBP12-Rapamycin-Binding) domain of mTOR, is thought to be an allosteric
inhibitor24,25. Rapamycin-FKBP12 inhibits mTORC1 to a variable extent that is substrate
and phosphorylation-site dependent25, and it does not bind to mTORC223. To overcome
these limitations, ATP-competitive inhibitors that potently and uniformly inhibit both
mTORC1 and mTORC2 are being developed as anti-cancer agents26.
The six mammalian PIKKs regulate diverse cellular processes27. They share three regions of
homology consisting of a ~600 residue FAT domain (FRAP, ATM, TRRAP), a ~300 residue
PI3K-related protein kinase catalytic domain, and a ~35 residue FATC domain at the Cterminus28. In mTOR, the ~100 residue FRB domain is thought to occur in-between the
FAT and catalytic domains, and the region N-terminal to the FAT domain is required for
binding to RAPTOR and RICTOR1.

Author Manuscript

Here we present the 3.2 Å crystal structure of a ~1500 amino acid mTOR-mLST8 complex
containing the FAT, FRB, kinase and FATC domains, as well as the structures of this
complex bound to an ATP transition state analog and to ATP-competitive inhibitors. We
discuss their implications for understanding mTOR function, regulation and inhibition by
rapamycin and ATP-competitive compounds.

Overall structure of mTORΔN–mLST8
Crystals were grown using an N-terminally truncated human mTOR (residues 1376 to 2549;
thereafter mTORΔN) bound to full-length human mLST8 (Supplementary Table 1). The
complex was produced in an HEK293-F cell line that was stably-transfected sequentially by
FLAG-tagged mLST8 and FLAG-tagged mTORΔN vectors. The kinase activity of

mTORΔN-mLST8 is overall comparable to that of mTORC1 (Supplementary Fig. 1).
mTORC1 is more active towards low-micromolar concentrations of S6K1ki (kinase-inactive
mutant) and 4EBP1, consistent with RAPTOR recruiting these substrates through their TOS
motifs, whereas mTORΔN-mLST8 is more active at higher substrate concentrations.
The mTORΔN-mLST8 structure has a compact shape (Fig. 1). The FAT domain, which
consists of α–α helical repeats, forms a “C” shaped α solenoid that wraps halfway around
the kinase domain and clamps onto it. mLST8 and the FRB domain protrude from the kinase
domain, on opposite sides of the catalytic cleft. The FATC is integral to the kinase domain
structure.

Author Manuscript

The ~550-residue mTOR kinase domain (KD) adopts the two-lobe structure that is
characteristic of both the PI3K and canonical protein kinase families29. It consists of an Nterminal lobe (N lobe), a larger C-terminal lobe (C lobe), and a cleft in-between the two that
binds to ATP. The mTOR KD contains the core PI3K KD fold, but with substantial
differences. While PI3K KD structures superimpose essentially across their entire ~350
residues, only ~250 residues of the mTOR KD superimpose on PI3Ks (Supplementary Table
2). In addition, the mTOR KD contains ~200 additional residues of insertions that decorate
the common fold. The largest of these is the FRB domain (residues 2021 to 2118) that is
inserted within the kinase N lobe (Fig. 1). There is also a ~40-residue insertion in the C lobe
that forms the binding site for mLST8 (residues 2258 to 2296; thereafter LBE).

Kinase domain structure

Author Manuscript

The mTOR KD structure starts prior to the FRB domain, with the long kα1 helix that is
present in PI3Ks as well (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2a). The kα1 helix is integral to
the structure of the N lobe, as it packs in the concave surface of the N lobe β sheet in both
mTOR and PI3Ks29. The FRB insertion occurs immediately after kα1. It is followed by a β
strand and two short helices that pack with the base of the FRB, and which replace the kα2
helix of the PI3K KD fold. Thereafter, the mTOR and PI3K N lobes share a similar
structure.

Author Manuscript

The mTOR structure indicates that the kα1 helix is present in all PIKKs (Supplementary
Fig. 3a). The SMG1, DNAPKcs and TRRAP PIKKs also appear to have an FRB-like
domain, as they contain insertions of 128, 95 and 128 residues, respectively, that are
predicted to be alpha-helical. This is supported by the 6.6 Å x-ray diffraction data of
DNAPKcs reported recently30. Although the deposited DNAPKcs model, which contains a
PI3K-derived KD, lacks the FRB insertion, a reinterpretation of the data using the mTOR
structure reveals electron density indicative of an FRB-like four-helix bundle
(Supplementary Fig. 3b). ATM and ATR appear to lack a comparable insertion.
In the C lobe, the vicinity of the catalytic cleft contains four structural insertions compared
to PI3Ks (LBE, kαAL, kα9b and FATC; Fig. 2a). These form a spine of interactions
centered on the activation loop, which is a ~30 residue segment with a central role in the
function and regulation of canonical protein kinases. It forms part of the polypeptide binding
site, provides an active site residue, and also undergoes a conformational change, typically
disorder-to-order transition, upon kinase activation31. The activation loop is thought to have

an analogous role in PI3Ks, among which only in the class 3 PIK3C3/Vps34 structures it is
ordered32. In the mTOR structure the entire activation loop is well ordered (Supplementary
Fig. 2b), and its middle portion contains the kαAL helix insertion. One side of the activation
loop packs with the kα9b insertion, and the other side with the FATC (Fig. 2a). The FATC
is not unique to PIKKs in its entirety, as its N-terminal half forms a helix (kα11) that is also
present in PI3K structures29,32. Its C-terminal half, which is absent from PI3Ks, forms three
short helices that pack with the activation loop on one side and the LBE on the other (Fig.
2a).

Author Manuscript

The interactions the FATC makes with the activation loop suggest that it may have a role in
stabilizing the activation loop structure, and the LBE, through its interactions with the
FATC, may contribute to this indirectly (Supplementary Fig. 4a). The FATC and activation
loop sequences are highly conserved among PIKKs. While the LBE is not conserved, all
PIKK family members contain an LBE-like insertion that may similarly pack with FATC
(Supplementary Fig. 3a).
The kα9b insertion (residues 2425 to 2436) plugs one end of the catalytic cleft (Fig. 2a). It
partially overlaps with a segment, termed negative regulatory domain (residues 2430 to
2450), whose deletion activates mTOR in vitro33 and in vivo34,35. After kα9b, there is a 55
residue unstructured segment (2437 to 2491) that is not conserved and has variable length in
mTOR orthologs (Supplementary Fig. 2a).

Active site conformation

Author Manuscript

To assess the activation state of the KD structure and investigate the mechanism of
phosphotransfer, we co-crystallized mTORΔN-mLST8 with ADP, Mg2+ and MgF3−, a
mimic of the γ-phosphate group of ATP in the transition state (TS)36 (Supplementary Table
1). The 3.5 Å Fo-Fc map of these crystals shows strong electron density extending from the
β-phosphate group of ADP, consistent with a bound MgF3− group (Fig. 2b). The presence of
two additional Mg2+ ions is supported by the anomalous dispersion maps of apo-crystals
soaked in AMPPNP-Mn2+ (Supplementary Fig. 4b).

Author Manuscript

A superposition with the protein kinase CDK2 bound to the same ATP TS mimic36 reveals
that the arrangement of key active site residues and MgF3− is remarkably conserved in
mTOR (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 4c). These include the C lobe Asn2343 and
Asp2357, which in both mTOR and protein kinases serve as metal ligands, and Asp2338,
which in protein kinases plays a key catalytic role in orienting and activating the substrate
hydroxyl group for nucleophilic attack36,37. The mTOR-CDK2 superposition also reveals a
coincidence of the mTOR His2340 and CDK2 Lys129 side chains (Fig. 2c). In protein
kinases, a basic residue at this position interacts with both the substrate hydroxyl group and
the γ-phosphate TS mimic, and is postulated to stabilize the buildup of charge at the
transition state36,37. Consistent with a similar role, we find that the kinase activity of the
H2340A mTORΔN-mLST8 mutant is barely detectable, and comparable to the D2338A
mutant previously shown to be inactive38 (Supplementary Fig. 4d).
These findings strongly suggest that the crystallized mTORΔN-mLST8 complex is
intrinsically active in the absence of any additional regulatory subunits. They also indicate

that PIKKs, and most likely PI3Ks, employ the same catalytic mechanism as canonical
protein kinases, in contrast to a recently proposed PI3K mechanism32 (see legend of
Supplementary Fig. 4c).

Substrate-binding site
The MgF3− γ-phosphate mimic points to an extended C lobe groove that is highly conserved
and is the likely site of substrate binding. Figure 2d illustrates this with a CDK2-bound
substrate peptide docked by superposing the mTOR and CDK2 TS36 complexes. The groove
consists of the activation loop, as in protein kinases, but also of portions of the FATC and
LBE.

Author Manuscript

In the (+) direction (C-terminal to phosphorylation site), the groove extends only to the +1
position, abruptly terminating with the kα9b helix that plugs this end of the cleft (Fig. 2d).
Thereafter, the peptide can exit along the C lobe towards mLST8, or along the N lobe
towards the FRB. The +1 portion of the groove has a pronounced pocket lined with three
aromatic residues, consistent with the two classes of mTOR substrates, exemplified by
4EBP1 and S6K1, having a proline and tyrosine residue, respectively, at +1 (Supplementary
Figs 5a and 5b). The groove extends substantially more in the (-) direction, and it may
account for the low-level sequence preference at -4 and -5 suggested by a positional
scanning peptide array39.

Restricted access to the active site

Author Manuscript

The four-helix FRB substantially extends the N lobe side of the catalytic cleft, while the
LBE and mLST8 extend the C lobe side. This gives the cleft a deep, “V”-shaped crosssection, restricting access to the substrate-binding site at the bottom of the cleft (Fig. 3a).
Substrate access is further hindered by one end of the cleft being plugged by kα9b and the
following 55-residue unstructured segment. Portions of kα9b and the unstructured segment
form the negative regulatory region33-35, suggesting that restricted access to the active site
negatively regulates mTOR. Kα9b is likely the key element because deleting the bulk of the
unstructured segment (residues 2443-2486) does not activate mTOR (Supplementary Fig. 6).

Author Manuscript

The end of the cleft opposite kα9b is unencumbered in the mTORΔN-mLST8 structure.
However, it is near the FAT N-terminus, and the region deleted from the crystallized
mTORΔN may restrict cleft access directly and/or through its associated RAPTOR or
RICTOR proteins. In support, we find that towards TOS-mutant 4EBP1 and S6K1ki
substrates, mTORΔN-mLST8 is more active than mTOR-mLST8, which in turn is more
active than mTOR-mLST8-RAPTOR (Supplementary Fig. 6). A restricted active site would
reduce the probability of substrates hitting the active site by random diffusion, and could
thus be important in allowing for the regulation of phosphorylation by substrate-recruitment.

Inhibition by rapamycin-FKBP12
In a model constructed by superposing the FRB domains of the FRB-rapamycin-FKBP1224
and mTORΔN-mLST8 structures, FKBP12 extends from the FRB towards mLST8 on the C
lobe, nearly capping the catalytic cleft (Fig. 3b). At their closest approach, FKBP12 and

mLST8 are only 8 Å apart, with the catalytic center recessed by 37 Å. The model suggests
that rapamycin-FKBP12 inhibits in part by drastically reducing the accessibility of the
already constricted catalytic cleft. This is consistent with the extent of mTORC1 inhibition
being substrate and phosphorylation site dependent25 (additional discussion in
Supplementary Fig. 6 legend).

FRB recruits S6K1 to active site

Author Manuscript

The rapamycin-binding site maps to the FRB surface closest to the active site, in the midst
of a hotspot of highly conserved residues (Fig. 4a). Four of these residues are invariant in 22
mTOR orthologs from yeast to man, and another four in 21 orthologs, in stark contrast to the
FRB surface opposite from the active site (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 7). This raises the
possibility that the rapamycin-binding site interacts with substrates to facilitate their entry to
the recessed active site.

Author Manuscript

This model is supported by the observation that mutation of Ser2035, a rapamycin
contact38,40 at the centre of the conservation hotspot, reduces phosphorylation of S6K1 and
4EBP133. It can also explain inhibition of mTORC1 and mTORC2 by rapamycin in the
absence of FKBP12, albeit at ~100-fold higher concentrations reflecting the weaker
rapamycin-FRB binary interaction41. However, these observations can also be explained by
the rapamycin-binding site interacting with other parts of mTOR, or with associated
proteins, especially since rapamycin was thought to be an allosteric inhibitor25. To rule this
out, we assayed mTORΔN-mLST8, and found that rapamycin but not the closely-related
FK506 macrolide inhibits S6K1ki overall phosphorylation, as measured by 32P incorporation
(Fig. 4b). Inhibition reaches ~45 % at the 20 μM solubility limit of rapamycin, close to the
free rapamycin-FRB Kd. Phosphorylation of the key Thr389 site of the S6K1 HM motif,
measured by a phosphoT389-specific antibody, is inhibited by ~80 % (Fig. 4b).
In a complementary approach, we tested whether the isolated FRB domain inhibits
phosphorylation in trans. Figure 4c shows that wild type but not the S2035I FRB
mutant38,40 inhibits overall S6K1ki phosphorylation by ~50 % and Thr389 phosphorylation
by ~75 % at the highest concentration tested.

Author Manuscript

To map the region of S6K1 involved in FRB interactions, we reasoned that its deletion
should reduce Thr389 phosphorylation and also render any residual phosphorylation
insensitive to rapamycin. By testing successively truncated polypeptides from the S6K1 tail,
we found that both criteria are met by residues 393 to 398 (Fig. 4d). In addition, residues
399 to 402 and 403 to 410 likely contribute to FRB interactions, as their truncation
progressively reduces phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 8). N-terminal truncations up to
residue 381 have no significant effect.
Together, these data indicate that the FRB provides a secondary substrate-recruitment site
near the entrance of the catalytic cleft. We presume that while the TOS and possibly other
motifs are the primary means of substrate recruitment, the secondary site may facilitate
substrate entry into the otherwise restricted active site, and it may also provide an additional
level of specificity, at least for a subset of substrates.

A bi-partite substrate-recruitment mechanism is analogous to what has been proposed for the
calcineurin phosphatase, the target of FK506-FKBP12. Most calcineurin substrates require
both a primary and a secondary recruitment motif for efficient dephosphorylation, and
FK506-FKBP12 inhibits by binding to the secondary recruitment motif site42.

FAT domain

Author Manuscript

The FAT domain contains 28 α helices arranged as α–α helical repeats. Helices α1 to α22
belong to the TPR repeat family and form three discontinuous domains (TRD1, TRD2 and
TRD3). Helices α23 to α28 belong to the HEAT family and form a single domain (HRD).
The four domains pack sequentially to form a C-shaped α solenoid that clamps onto the KD
(Supplementary Figs 9a and 9b). TRD1 interacts with the C lobe on one side of the KD, and
after TRD2-TRD3 traverse to the other side, the HRD interacts with both the N and C lobes
of the KD (Supplementary Figs 9c and 9d).
Both the TRD1-KD and HRD-KD contacts involve conserved residues, consistent with the
two interfaces being important for the structure and function of mTOR. For example, a set of
buried hydrogen bond contacts at the TRD1-KD interface (Glu1401-Arg2317) and at the
HRD-KD interface (Arg1905-Glu2419 and Gln1941- Gln2200) involves residues invariant
in 22 mTOR orthologs (Supplementary Figs 9c and 9d).
The TRD1 and HRD segments correspond to the FAT segments best conserved among
PIKK family members28 as well, suggesting that the FAT domain clamping onto the KD is a
common feature of this family. In addition, PI3Ks contain a HEAT-repeat domain analogous
to the HRD in its structure and interactions with the KD, although they lack the rest of the
FAT domain (Supplementary Fig. 9e).

Author Manuscript

mLST8
mLST8 consists of seven WD40 repeats. At the narrow end of the mLST8 β propeller
structure, a surface that extends across six WD40 repeats binds to both helices and
intervening loop of the LBE helix-loop-helix structure. The interface involves mostly polar
LBE residues and polar/aromatic mLST8 residues, and it is dominated by hydrogen bonds
(Supplementary Fig. 10).

Author Manuscript

mLST8 is thought to be a requisite activating subunit of mTOR complexes8,9. The structure
suggests the extended interaction surface of mLST8 may directly stabilize the LBE
structure, and indirectly influence the organization of the active site through the LBEFATC-catalytic loop spine of interactions (Supplementary Fig. 4a). In support, we note that
lack of mLST8 results in the association of mTOR with heat shock proteins9, and we find
that the solubility of overexpressed mTOR is highly dependent on mLST8 co-expression
(not shown). In addition, the growth-suppression phenotype of a temperature-sensitive yeast
Lst8 allele can be rescued by mutations43 either at the LBE hydrophobic core (A2290V) or
at the following kα5 helix (L2302Q), and the structure is consistent with these mutations
stabilizing the local LBE structure.

Control of mTOR kinase activity
The model that active site restriction is a negative regulatory mechanism is supported by
hyper-activating mutations43-45, most of which map to structural elements involved in
limiting active site access. A large number of mutations cluster at the end of the catalytic
cleft that is plugged by kα9b (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 11). They map to the kα3, kα9,
kα9b and kα10 helices that pack extensively with each other, and to the FAT HRD portion
that packs with kα3 and kα9. These mutations are likely to loosen the kα9b-centered
structural framework that restricts access from this end of the cleft, presumably without
destabilizing the entire active site structure. The role of the FAT clamp is highlighted by the
widely studied E2419K activating mutation, which eliminates the Glu2419-Arg1905 salt
bridge at the kα9-HRD interface (Supplementary Figs 9c and 11).

Author Manuscript

Two other hyper-activating mutations map to a portion of the kα1 helix that is sandwiched
between the FRB base and the N lobe β sheet43,44. These mutations (I2017V and A2020V)
are unlikely to unfold the FRB, because an FRB hydrophobic core mutation (W2027F)
abolishes kinase activity40. The structure suggests that these mutations may loosen the rigid
coupling of the FRB the catalytic cleft, increasing access to the active site.
A third cluster of mutations43 maps to the N-terminal portion of the FAT domain, to
structural residues of TRD1 and of the TRD1-proximal portion of TRD2. These mutations
would likely destabilize TRD1-KD interactions through loss of structural integrity. They
may also destabilize the HRD-KD interactions, since the structural coupling of TRD1 and
HRD would thermodynamically couple their KD contacts. In addition, the disposition of the
N-terminal mTOR segment and its associated RAPTOR could change or become more
flexible relative to the KD.

Inhibitors of the ATP-binding site
To explore the determinants of inhibitor potency and specificity, we determined the
structures of mTORΔN-mLST8 bound to Torin2 and PP242, which are highly specific for
mTOR, and to PI-103, which has dual specificity for mTOR and Class I PI3Ks
(Supplementary Table 3).

Author Manuscript

The overall orientation of Torin2 in the ATP site is as predicted 46 (Fig. 6a and
Supplementary Fig. 12a). The tricyclic benzonapththyridine ring binds to the adenine site
and makes a hydrogen bond to the N-C lobe “hinge”, analogous to one of two backbone
hydrogen bonds made by ATP and diverse PI3/protein kinase inhibitors. The amino-pyridine
group reaches into the “inner hydrophobic pocket”, an area in the back of the cleft that many
kinase inhibitors contact. However, it does not make the three predicted hydrogen bonds (to
Asp2195, Asp2357 and Tyr2225)46. Rather, the structure reveals that a key interaction is the
extensive stacking of the tricyclic benzonapththyridine ring with the indole group of
Trp2239 from the “hinge” (Fig. 6a). In the ATPγS complex, Trp2239 stacks partially with a
three-atom portion of the adenine. In the Torin2 complex, by contrast, Trp2239 stacks with a
ten-atom portion of the tricyclic Troin2 ring. This likely makes a substantial contribution to
the sub-nanomolar potency46 of Torin2. In addition, because Trp2239 is not present in
canonical protein kinases or in PI3Ks, it would also contribute to Torin2’s ~800-fold

specificity for mTOR over PI3Ks46. The structure also reveals that the Torin2
trifluoromethyl group packs into an N lobe pocket (Ile2163, Pro2169 and Leu2185; Fig. 6a).
These contacts are less extensive than those made to Trp2239, and only Leu2185 is variable
across the PIKK and PI3K families. They may contribute to Torin2-mTOR specificity,
however, as this portion of the N lobe β sheet exhibits considerable variation in its relative
orientation in PI3K structures.

Author Manuscript

PP242 consists of the adenine-mimetic pyrazolopyrimidine scaffold common to PI3/tyrosine
kinase inhibitors, with a hydroxyindole substituent at a position that often points to the inner
hydrophobic pocket47. In mTOR, this pocket is lined with residues conserved across the
PI3K and PIKK families, and the selectivity of PP242 for mTOR was unexpected47. The
structure reveals that while these two PP242 groups are generally positioned as predicted47,
mTOR undergoes a conformational change that expands and deepens the inner hydrophobic
pocket, with the PP242 hydroxyindole group reaching deep into the new space (Fig. 6b and
Supplementary Fig. 12b). The conformational change involves the Tyr2225 side chain at the
back of the pocket swinging (Δχ1 = 108°) out of the way of the hydroxyindole group (Fig. 6c
and Supplementary Fig. 12c). Because Tyr2225 is part of the local hydrophobic core
between the N and C lobes, this necessitates additional concerted changes. The Leu2354
side chain rotates (Δχ1 = 166°) away from the incoming Tyr2225, the Gln2223 side chain
moves in to plug a resulting gap, and a 3-residue main chain stretch (residues 2223 to 2225)
shifts by ~1 Å. In PI3Ks, Leu2354 is replaced by a conserved phenylalanine that cannot
undergo a similar conformational change, at least without an even more extensive repacking
of the local hydrophobic core. Leu2354 is thus likely to be a major, though indirect,
determinant of the selectivity of PP242 for mTOR over PI3Ks and other kinases.

Author Manuscript

The multi-targeted PI-10348 does not take advantage of any of the aforementioned mTORspecific features. The morpholine ring binds to the adenine pocket and makes two hydrogen
bonds to the “hinge”, while the m-phenol group binds to the inner pocket and makes two
hydrogen bonds to the Tyr2225 and Asp2195 side chains at the back of the cleft (Fig. 6d and
Supplementary Fig. 12d). These hydrogen bonds are likely to be important for the high
affinity of PI-103 for mTOR and, presumably, for Class I PI3Ks where the relevant protein
groups are similarly positioned. In support, we note that the ~500-fold weaker affinity48
Class III PI3K–PI-103 complex lacks both m-phenol hydrogen bonds and one of the “hinge”
hydrogen bonds32.

Conclusions
Author Manuscript

The mTORΔN structure reveals an intrinsically active but otherwise highly restricted
catalytic centre, and together with activating mutations points to substrate recruitment as a
major mechanism controlling the kinase activity. Our biochemical data on S6K1 indicates
that in addition to a primary recruitment motif, a secondary recruitment motif proximal to
the phosphorylation site is needed for efficient phosphorylation. The FRB acts as a
gatekeeper by restricting access to the active site while also granting privileged substrates
access through its binding site for the secondary motif. Co-crystal structures of ATPcompetitive inhibitors reveal multiple determinants of mTOR specificity, including a
conformational change deep inside the catalytic cleft.

Protein expression and purification

Author Manuscript

The boundary of the crystallized human mTORΔN (residues 1376-2549) was identified by
screening successive N-terminal truncations of mTOR, produced by transient transfection in
HEK293-F cells, for expression levels, solubility and size exclusion chromatography profile
(not shown). For large-scale production of mTORΔN–mLST8, we generated an HEK 293-F
cell line that was stably-transfected sequentially by modified pcDNA3.1 vectors encoding
FLAG-tagged mLST8 and FLAG-tagged mTORΔN. In the absence of mLST8 coexpression, the level of soluble mTORΔN was substantially lower, and it co-purified with
endogenous mLST8 (not shown). The mTORΔNΔ–2486-mLST8, full-length human mTORmLST8 and human mTORC1 (mTOR-mLST8-RAPTOR) complexes were similarly
produced in HEK 293-F cell lines that were stably transfected with the FLAG-tagged
versions of the proteins. Cells were grown as monolayers in 15 centimeter plates. They were
lysed in 50mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mM KCl, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA,
10 % (v/v) glycerol, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and protease inhibitors using French Press.
After centrifugation, the FLAG-tagged proteins were affinity purified using anti-FLAG M2
agarose beads (Sigma). Following cleavage of the FLAG-tags by tobacco etch virus (TEV)
protease, they were purified by ion exchange (MonoQ) and gel-filtration chromatography.
The purified complex was concentrated to 5 mg ml-1 by ultrafiltration in 20 mM Tris-Cl,
500 mM NaCl, 10 mM DTT, pH 8.0 and was used for crystallization immediately. For
kinase assays, 10% (v/v) glycerol was added to protein aliquots for storage at -80 °C.

Human S6K1αIIki protein, which contains the kinase-inactivating K100R mutation, was
produced by infecting High Five insect cells with a pFastBac1 baculovirus expressing the
FLAG-tagged protein. It was purified by affinity chromatography with anti-FLAG M2
agarose beads. The protein was concentrated to 8 mg ml-1 in 50 mM Tris-Cl, 400 mM NaCl,
1mM EDTA, 1mM EGTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mM DTT, 1 mM Pefabloc, pH 8.0, and it
was stored at -80 °C.
Human 4EBP1 was overexpressed in the E. Coli strain BL21(DE3) from a modified
pGEX4T3 vector, and was purified by glutathione affinity chromatography, cleavage of the
GST tag with TEV protease, fractionation on MonoQ column, removal of free GST by
glutathione affinity, and finally gel filtration (Superdex75) chromatography. The peak
fractions were concentrated to 20 mg ml-1 in 20 mM Tris-Cl, 200 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v)
glycerol, 10 mM DTT, pH 8.0.
Crystallization and data collection

Author Manuscript

Crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapour diffusion method at 4 °C. Apo-crystals of
the mTORΔN–mLST8 complex were grown from 100 mM Tris-Cl, 6-8% (w/v) polyethylene
glycol (PEG) 8000, 500 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mM DTT, pH 8.5. Crystals of the
mTORΔN-mLST8 bound to ADP-MgF3-Mg2 were grown similarly, except the well-buffer
contained 10 mM MgCl2, 3 mM ADP, and 20 mM NaF. The mTORΔN-mLST8-ATPγS-Mg2
complex was prepared by soaking apo-crystals for one hour in a stabilization buffer of 50
mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 10 mM Tris-Cl, 8.0, 10% PEG8000, 0.1 M NaCl, 6% glycerol,

supplemented with 5 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM ATPγS. The mTORΔN-mLST8-AMPPNP-Mn2
complex was prepared by soaking apo-crystals similarly, except the stabilization buffer had
a pH of 7.5 and it was supplemented with 1 mM AMPPNP and 2 mM MnCl2, and the data
was collected at the Manganese absorption edge. Crystals of mTORΔN-mLST8-Torin2 and
mTORΔN-mLST8-PI-103 were prepared by mixing 1 mM of the inhibitors with the protein.
Co-crystals appeared from the same condition as the apo-crystals. Crystals of mTORΔNmLST8-PP242 were prepared by soaking apo-crystals for 2.5 hours in the stabilization
buffer supplemented with 0.2 mM PP242. Apo-crystals were harvested in stabilization
buffer, transferred to 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.1 M NaCl, 14%
(w/v) PEG8000, 22% (v/v) glycerol, and were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Crystals with
ADP-MgF3-Mg2, ATPγS-Mg2, Torin2, PI103 and PP242 were flash-frozen similarly, except
for the presence of the corresponding cofactors or inhibitors (0.1 mM) in the buffers.
Diffraction data were collected at -170 °C at the ID24C and ID24E beamlines of the
Advanced Photon Source, and they were processed with the HKL suite49.
Structure determination and refinement

Author Manuscript

Initial phases were obtained from isomorphous and anomalous differences of two heavy
atom derivatives, prepared by soaking crystals in stabilization buffer lacking DTT and
supplemented with 1 mM uranyl acetate (1 hour), or with 0.4 mM potassium-gold cyanide
(75 min.) at at 4° C. Initial phases, calculated with the program SHARP50 had a mean figure
of merit of 0.35 (35.0 to 4.5 Å). The uranyl derivative had a dispersive phasing power (Pp)
of 0.89 and anomalous Pp of 0.60, with a dispersive Rcullis of 0.79 and anomalous Rcullis of
0.95. The gold derivative had a dispersive Pp of 0.80 and anomalous Pp of 0.29, with a
dispersive Rcullis of 0.66 and anomalous Rcullis of 0.98. The phases were improved using
solvent flattening and two-fold ncs averaging with multiple masks with the program DM51.
The model was built using O52 and refined first with REFMAC551 and then with
PHENIX53, using tight ncs restraints on atom positions. The final model contains residues
1385 to 2549 of human mTOR, and 8 to 324 of human mLST8. mTORΔN residues
1376-1384 at the N-terminus, residues 1815-1866 in the FAT domain, and residues
2437-2491 between kα9b and kα10 in the KD are disordered. mLST8 residues 1-7 and
325-326 from the N- and C-termini are disordered. The Ramachandran plot, calculated by
PROCHECK, has 88.5, 11.0 and 0.5 % of the residues in the most favored, additionally
allowed, and generously allowed regions, respectively. There are no residues in disallowed
regions. The Rfree test set of the Native data contains 1699 reflections.
In vitro kinase assays

Author Manuscript

All kinase assays were performed in a buffer of 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 10
mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 3 % (v/v) glycerol, for 30 minutes at 30° C, in a final volume of 15
μl. For a typical reaction, the indicated amount of enzymes, substrates, and competitors were
incubated together for 10 minutes on ice in the kinase buffer in a final volume of 13.5 μl.
Reactions were started by the addition of 1.5 μl of cold ATP (0.5 mM final concentration)
including 2 μCi of [γ-32P] ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, Perkin-Elmer). In assays with rapamycin,
all reactions in a titration contained a constant level of 3.3 % DMSO. Reactions were
stopped by the addition of 15 μl of 2X NuPAGE LDS sample buffer and boiling for 3
minutes, and were resolved in a 4-12 % NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel. Where applicable, each
