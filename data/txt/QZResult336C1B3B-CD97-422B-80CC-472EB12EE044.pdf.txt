ABSTRACT
TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which is a member of the TNF
superfamily, can induce tumor cell apoptosis. However, multiple types of tumor,
including hepatocellular carcinoma, show tolerance to TRAIL. Previous studies have
demonstrated that tumor cells usually change their expression profile of microRNA
(miRNA) to obtain the ability of tolerance to drugs. However, whether such change
of miRNA on TRAIL sensitivity is seen in hepatocellular carcinoma still needs to be
explored. In this study, we observed overexpression of miR-106b in both HCC patients’
tumor tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of miR-106b
is associated with the sensitivity of TRAIL to HCC. Silencing of miR-106b with antisense
oligonucleotide (anti-miR-106b) is proved to enhance the TRAIL-induced apoptosis and
reduce the acquired drug resistance to TRAIL in HCC. Mechanically, we didn’t observe
the obvious change of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and Bid) and anti-apoptotic proteins
(Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and Bcl-xl) after treatment of anti-miR-106b. However, we used the
methods of bioinformatics, flow cytometry, cellular and molecular methods to prove that
miR-106b directly targeted to death receptor 4 (DR4) 3′-UTR (3′-Untranslated Regions).
MiR-106b inhibitors induced increase of DR4 expression and therefore enhancing TRAILmediated apoptosis in HCC. In summary, these results suggest the application of miR106b inhibitors in HCC treatment. Combination with miR-106b inhibitors and TRAIL may
be a novel clinical treatment method on HCC treatment in the future.

INTRODUCTION

despite advances in treatment strategies, the rate of 5-year
survival remains very low, because HCC exhibits poor
response to various kinds of treatments [4, 5]. Given this,
it’s urgent to explore novel and efficient approaches to raise
the response of HCC cells to drugs.
TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is
a member of the TNF superfamily. In TRAIL pathway,
death receptors 4/5 (DR4/5) is able to bind with it to form
the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) followed by

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading
causes of cancer deaths worldwide due to the late diagnosis
and poor prognosis [1]. Although the surgery is the most
effective treatment for early stage HCC patients, the
cancer is unresectable for the patients with advanced HCC.
Therefore, systemic chemotherapy and immunotherapy are
considered as the alternative option [2, 3]. Unfortunately,

activating caspase-8-dependent apoptosis [6–8]. Previous
reports have demonstrated that multiple types of cancer
show high sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis both
in vitro and in vivo. In addition, TRAIL treatment is
harmless to normal cells. Thus, TRAIL has been tested as a
promising new candidate for use in the treatment of cancer
[9–11]. However, some cancer cells, including HCC, show
tolerance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis [12]. Therefore,
increasing the sensitivity of TRAIL will be of great help
to explore the clinical application of it in cancer therapy.
Recent researches have emphasized close
connection between microRNAs (miRNAs) and cancers.
miRNAs are a class of endogenous, small, and non-coding
RNAs that suppress the expression of target genes by
binding to the complementary sequences of target mRNA
3ʹ UTR at the seed site [13, 14]. As miRNAs regulate
numerous genes in cancer cells, they participate in a wide
array of biological processes such as cell proliferation,
differentiation, metabolism and apoptosis [15, 16]. In
HCC, studies have demonstrated that miRNAs are usually
dysregulated. Furthermore, ectopic expression of miRNAs
induces chemoresistance, which causes low response of
HCC cells to anti-tumor drugs [17–19]. In this study, we
aim to investigate the relationship between miR-106b and
sensitivity of HCC cells to TRAIL.

anti-miR-106b in TRAIL-induced apoptosis in Huh7 and
HepG2. As expected, more apoptotic cells were observed in
the group that treated with the combination with anti-miR106b and TRAIL rather than the TRAIL single treatment
group (Figure 2B). We therefore demonstrated that miR106b inhibitors are able to enhance the anti-tumor effect of
TRAIL on HCC through the apoptotic pathway.

MiR-106b inhibitors increase the expression of
DR4 in HCC cell lines
To explore the potential mechanisms by which
anti-miR-106b increases the sensitivity of HCC cells to
TRAIL, we performed western blot assays to detect the
expression of c-FLIP and Bcl-2 family proteins which
are master regulators of cell survival and apoptosis [20].
However, transfection with anti-miR-106b didn’t induce
obvious change of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and Bid)
and anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bcl-xl and
c-FLIP) (Figure 3A). Since TRAIL signaling induces
apoptosis by binding to DR4 and DR5 [21], we next
investigated whether miR-106b inhibitors changed the
expression of DR4/5. We found that the expression of
DR4 but not the DR5 was significantly increased due to
the anti-miR-106b treatment (Figure 3A). Furthermore,
the results of flow cytometry analysis showed that antimiR-106b obviously increased the number of DR4 on the
surface of Huh7 and HepG2, but didn’t influence the DR5
(Figure 3B). These results demonstrated that miR-106b
inhibitors have the ability to increase the number of DR4
to enhance the TRAIL pathway in HCC.

RESULTS
Expression of miR-106b is increased in HCC
tissues and cell lines
To explore the potential role of miR-106b in HCC, we
detected the expression of miR-106b in thirty HCC patients’
samples. As shown in Figure 1A, expression of miR-106b
was significantly increased in HCC tissues compared to their
adjacent normal tissues. Furthermore, we observed that both
the cultured HCC cell lines Huh7 and HepG2 expressed
higher levels of miR-106b compared to the normal embryo
liver cell line LO2 (Figure 1B). These results indicated that
miR-106b may be a potential promoter in HCC.

DR4 is the target of miR-106b in HCC
Preceding results indicated that miR-106b inhibitors
increased the DR4 expression. So we tried to explore the
molecular mechanisms responsible for the function of antimiR-106b that was observed above. After searching the
potential targets of miR-106b on the public miRNA database of
TargetScan, we found that the 3ʹ UTR of DR4 mRNA contained
complementary pairing site at the position of 127–134 (Figure
4A). To confirm that miR-106 b directly interacts with DR4
3ʹ UTR, we cloned the corresponding 3ʹ-UTR fragment of
DR4 into the pMIR reporters and subsequently performed
the luciferase assays. As shown in Figure 4B, transfection
with miR-106b mimics significantly decreased the luciferase
activities of the pMIR reporters contained wildtype but not the
mutant 3ʹ-UTR of DR4. In contrast, anti-miR-106b significantly
increased the luciferase activities of the wildtype pMIR reporters.
These results proved that DR4 is the target of miR-106b in HCC.

MiR-106b inhibitors enhance the anti-tumor
effect of TRAIL in HCC cell lines
To explore the potential role of miR-106b in TRAILsensitivity to HCC, we performed CCK-8 cell viability
assays and gain-and-loss experiments of miR-106b. We
found that miR-106b mimics increased the cytotoxicity of
TRAIL to HCC cell lines slightly. However, we observed
that the miR-106b inhibitors (anti-miR-106b) dramatically
enhanced the TRAIL-induced cell death of Huh7 and
HepG2 cells. IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration)
of TRAIL to miR-control transfected Huh7 and HepG2
cells was 1.82 and 2.14 fold higher than the anti-miR-106b
transfected Huh7 and HepG2 cells, respectively (Figure 2A).
As the TRAIL functions as an anti-tumor drug by inducing
apoptosis in cancer cells, we next investigated the role of

apoptosis. We next investigated the role of anti-miR-106b
in TRAIL signaling pathway. As TRAIL-DR4 signaling
initiates caspase-8-dependent apoptosis (8), we first
detected the activation of caspase-8 in HCC cells treated
with anti-miR-106b and TRAIL. As shown in Figure 5A,
anti-miR-106b significantly enhanced the activation of
caspase-8 induced by TRAIL. In addition, knockdown
of DR4 by specific siRNA was observed to abolish the
effect of anti-miR-106b. It indicated that anti-miR-106b
promoted activation of caspase-8 is dependent on the
increase of DR4. Bid is the substrate of caspase-8, which
can be cleaved by caspase-8 as tBid and translocated
to mitochondria (22). As expected, we found that antimiR-106b was able to promote the translocation of
tBid to mitochondria in TRAIL pathway (Figure 5B).
Researches have demonstrated that accumulation of
tBid on mitochondria membranes induces mitochondrial
apoptosis cells (23). According to our results of flow
cytometry, we found that combination with anti-miR-106b

and TRAIL induced significant decrease of mitochondrial
membrane potential (MMP), despite DR4 siRNA
inhibited the collapse of mitochondria (Figure 5C). It’s
indicated that miR-106b inhibitors are able to enhance
the mitochondrial apoptosis induced by TRAIL signaling
through upregulating the expression of DR4. As the results,
caspase-9 and caspase-3 was activated, and PARP which
is the substrate of caspase-3 was cleaved (Figure 5D). In
the final step, combination with anti-miR-106a and TRAIL
induced significant apoptosis in Huh7 and HepG2 cells
(Figure 5E). Taken together, we demonstrated that miR106b inhibitors enhance the TRAIL-dependent apoptosis
by increasing the expression of DR4 in HCC cell lines.

TRAIL in vivo
To investigate whether miR-106b inhibitors increased
the anti-tumor effect of TRAIL in vivo, we established

the in vivo model of HCC by using lentivirus transfected
HepG2 cells (LT-control transfected HepG2 or LT-antimiR-106b transfected HepG2). We didn’t observe obvious
difference of tumor sizes between LT-control group and
LT-anti-miR-106b group. However, inhibition of miR-106b
significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effect of TRAIL in
HCC in vivo model (Figure 6A and 6B). After analyzing the
expression of miR-106b and DR4 in tumor tissues derived
from HepG2 in vivo model, we observed low expression
level of miR-106b and high expression level of DR4 in
LT-anti-miR-106b transfected HepG2 cells (Figure 6C and
6D). These results demonstrated that miR-106b inhibitors
enhanced the anti-tumor effect of TRAIL by increasing the
expression of DR4 on HCC in vivo model.

TRAIL-R-HepG2 via suppressing the expression of DR4
(Figure 7B). In addition, results of flow cytometry showed
that transfection with anti-miR-106b was able to increase the
apoptosis of TRAIL-R-Huh7 and TRAIL-R-HepG2 cells
which were treated with TRAIL (Figure 7C). These results
demonstrated that MiR-106b inhibitors are able to reverse
the drug-resistance of HCC to TRAIL.

DISCUSSION
Accumulating evidences have demonstrated that
aberrant expression of miRNAs induces drug-resistance
in cancers, and lead to low response to cancer therapy
[25, 26]. Among these dysregulated miRNAs, miR-106b is
reported to promote cancer development, proliferation and
metastasis in multiple tumors including HCC. It has been
reported that overexpression of miR-106b activates the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process of HCC
to promote cell migration and metastasis [27]. Knockdown
of miR-106b resulted in reduction of cell proliferation
in renal cell carcinoma and HCC [28, 29]. These studies
indicate that miR-106b acts as a potential oncogene.
TRAIL is an anti-tumor cytokine, which selectively
kills cancer cells through apoptotic pathway without
damaging normal cells. However, low sensitivity to TRAIL
becomes a big obstacle for the use of it in some cancer types
[30]. In the present study, we observed the overexpression
of miR-106b in HCC. Moreover, our results demonstrated

MiR-106b inhibitors reverse the drug-resistance
of HCC to TRAIL
TRAIL has yet to be successfully used in clinical
predominantly because of the rapid onset of TRAIL resistance
(24). We therefore established the TRAIL-resistant Huh7 and
HepG2 models to investigate the relationship between miR106b inhibitors and TRAIL-resistance in HCC. As shown
in Figure 7A, TRAIL resistant Huh7 (TRAIL-R-Huh7)
and TRAIL resistant HepG2 (TRAIL-R-HepG2) exhibited
significant low response to TRAIL treatment. However, we
observed that transfection with anti-miR-106b obviously
increased the cytotoxicity of TRAIL to TRAIL-R-Huh7 and

that miR-106b was associated with sensitivity of HCC
cells to TRAIL. Knockdown of miR-106b by its antisense
oligodeoxynucleotides was able to elevate the response of
HCC cells to the apoptosis induced by the TRAIL signaling.

In TRAIL signaling pathway, cleavage of
caspase-8 is the incidence followed by the coupling of
the TRAIL with its receptor of DR4 and DR5. As the
results of caspase-8 activation, Bid, which is one pro-

apoptotic protein, is subsequently triggered as truncated
Bid (tBid) [31, 32]. tBid targets to mitochondrial outer
membrane to induce the collapse of mitochondrial
membrane potential (MMP) in the presence of Bax and
Bak to induce the mitochondria apoptosis [33, 34]. In
this study, we aim to explore the mechanisms by which
miR-106b inhibitors increased the cytotoxicity of TRAIL
to HCC. Our data showed that miR-106b inhibitors
didn’t change the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins
but increase the amount of DR4 on the HCC cell surface.
Indeed, the TRAIL signaling was augmented due to
increase of DR4 expression. Subsequently, we found that
miR-106b inhibitors enhanced the cleavage of caspase-8,
-9, -3 and mitochondrial apoptosis which was TRAILdependent. In general, our evidences demonstrate that
miR-106b inhibitors have the ability to strengthen the
TRAIL apoptotic signaling through increasing the
expression of DR4.
Previous studies have pointed out that rapid
tolerance of TRAIL often happens in cancer therapy, and
it is a problem needs to be solved urgently [35, 36]. In
the present study, we established the TRAIL-resistant
HCC models to study the role of miR-106b in the
acquired resistance to TRAIL. Interestingly, our results
demonstrate that miR-106b inhibitors are able to weaken
the TRAIL-resistance and increase the cytotoxicity of
TRAIL in HCC models.
In summary, this study suggests the application of
miR-106b inhibitors in TRAIL treatment. Combination with
miR-106b inhibitors may be a novel strategy to overcome
the rapid tolerance of TRAIL in HCC treatment in the future.

Cell lines and tissue samples
Human HCC cell lines (Huh7 and HepG2) and
human normal embryo liver cell line (LO2) were obtained
from the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology,
Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Cell
lines were cultured in DMEM basic medium (Gibco,
USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, USA)
at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. A total
of 30 primary hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and their
adjacent normal tissues were obtained from patients who
underwent tumor resection in The Second Affiliated
Hospital & Yuying Children’s Hospital of Wenzhou
Medical University from 5/2014 to 11/2016. Use of tumor
samples in the present study was approved by the ethics
committee of The Second Affiliated Hospital & Yuying

Measurement of cell viability

Detection System (Applied Biosystems, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Quantization of U6 snRNA
was used to normalize the expression level of miR-106b.

Huh7 and HepG2 cells were seeded in 96-well
plates overnight at the density of 5 × 103 per well. Cells
were transfected with RNA oligoribonucleotides before
treatment with different concentrations of TRAIL (R&D
system, USA). After incubation with TRAIL for 48 h,
cell viability was measured by using CCK-8 detection kit
(Sigma-Aldrich, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) of
TRAIL to Huh7 and HepG2 cells was calculated acoording
to the results of CCK-8 cell viability assays.

RNA oligoribonucleotides and transfection
All of the RNA oligoribonucleotides [miR106b mimics, miR-106b inhibitor (anti-miR-106b),
miR-control and DR4 siRNA] were purchased from
Genechem Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). Anti-miR-106b
is 2ʹ-O-methyl-modified RNA oligoribonucleotides with
the sequences complementary to the mature miR-106b.
The negative control RNA duplex (miR-control) for
miR-106b mimic, anti-miR-106b and the DR4 siRNA
was nonhomologous to any human genome sequences.
For transfection, RNA oligoribonucleotides (50 pmol/
ml) were transiently transfected into the HCC cells with
Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Luciferase assays
Human DR4 mRNA 3ʹ UTR sequences were
amplified and inserted into pMIR Firefly luciferase
reporters (Ambion, USA). Reporters contained mutant
DR4 mRNA 3ʹ UTR were created by using the site-

were cultured in TRAIL-free medium for 2 weeks to
eliminate the effect of remanent TRAIL.

Animal models and treatment
Animal experiments were carried out in four-weekold female immunodefcient nude BALB/c mice were
purchased from Shanghai Super-B&K Laboratory Animal
Corp., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). For xenograft, HepG2 cells
were transfected with 5 × 105 transducing units of empty
lentivirus (LT-control) or recombinant lentivirus contained
miR-106b antisense nucleotide sequences (LT-anti-miR106b) (Genechem Co., Ltd). 5 × 106 transfected HepG2
were injected into animals to establish a subcutaneous
tumor model. After 7 days, the animals were randomized
into 4 treatment groups and received intraperitoneal
(i.p.) injections of 40 µg/kg TRAIL per two days. Tumor
volume was assessed every three days for a total of 28
days post-injection. The animal care and experimental
protocols were approved by the Animal Care Committee
of The Second Affiliated Hospital & Yuying Children’s
Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University.

Separation of mitochondria and western blot
analysis
To separate mitochondria from cytoplasm in
Huh7 and HepG2 cells, mitochondria/Cytosol Fraction
Kit (BioVision, USA) was used according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Mitochondria -derived proteins
or total proteins in Huh7 and HepG2 were extracted
by using radio immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA)
lysis buffer (Cell Signaling, USA). Concentrations of
each protein sample were determined by BCA Assay
Kit (Pierce, USA). Equal amounts of proteins in each
sample were separated by 12.5% sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and
transferred to polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes
(Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Membranes were then
probed with primary antibodies (anti-Bcl-2, anti-Mcl-1,
anti-Bcl-xl, anti-Bax, anti-Bid, anti-c-FLIP, anti-DR5,
anti-DR4, anti-cleaved caspase-8, anti-cleaved caspase-9,
anti-cleaved caspase-3, anti-cleaved PARP, anti-Cox Ⅳ
and anti-β-actin, Cell Signaling) overnight. Subsequently,
the Membranes were incubated with suitable horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h. Blots
were visualized by using enhanced chemilu-minescence
detection kit (Pierce).

Statistical analysis
Data are represented as mean ± SD and analyzed by
using SPSS 15.0 software. Student’s t test and ANOVA
analysis were used to compare mean values. A P < 0.05
was considered to be statistically significant. All the
experiments were independently repeated at least 3 times.
