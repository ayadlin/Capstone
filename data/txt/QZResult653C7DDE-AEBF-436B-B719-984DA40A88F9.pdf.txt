SUMMARY
Author Manuscript

Brain metastasis represents a substantial source of morbidity and mortality in various cancers, and
is characterized by high resistance to chemotherapy. Here we define the role of the most abundant
cell type in the brain, the astrocyte, in promoting brain metastasis. Breast and lung cancer cells
express protocadherin 7 (PCDH7) to favor the assembly of carcinoma-astrocyte gap junctions
composed of connexin 43 (Cx43). Once engaged with the astrocyte gap-junctional network, brain
metastatic cancer cells employ these channels to transfer the second messenger cGAMP to
astrocytes, activating the STING pathway and production of inflammatory cytokines IFNα and
TNFα. As paracrine signals, these factors activate the STAT1 and NF-κB pathways in brain
metastatic cells, which support tumour growth and chemoresistance. The orally bioavailable
modulators of gap junctions meclofenamate and tonabersat break this paracrine loop, and we

provide proof-of-principle for the applicability of this therapeutic strategy to treat established brain
metastasis.

Brain metastases occur in 20-40% of advanced stage cancers and represent the most
prevalent adult intracranial malignancy1. Current clinical management of brain metastases
affords limited disease control and most patients succumb to tumour progression less than
twelve months after diagnosis1,2; better therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Recent
work has begun to describe the cellular and molecular interactions responsible for brain
metastasis. Circulating cancer cells first traverse the blood-brain barrier (BBB)3,4 to enter
the parenchyma where they co-opt the microvasculature5,6. However, the vast majority of
cancer cells that infiltrate the brain perish, rejected by astrocytes6. The astrocyte network
serves a protective role in the CNS7,8. In brain metastasis, reactive astrocytes generate the
protease plasmin and cytotoxic cytokines. Brain metastatic cells counter this defense with
serpin inhibitors of plasminogen activator6. Yet, astrocyte-cancer cell interactions may not
be uniformly antagonistic: brain metastases contain abundant reactive astrocytes8, and
astrocytes can exert a beneficial effect on cancer cell co-cultures9.
Here, we show that brain metastatic cells selectively establish Cx43 gap junctions with
astrocytes by means of protocadherin 7 (PCDH7). These channels allow for passage of
cGAMP from cancer cells to astrocytes to activate STING, an innate immune response
pathway to cytosolic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)10. The resulting astrocyte production
of interferon (IFN)-α and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α supports growth and
chemoresistance in brain metastatic cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of these gap junctions in
mice suppresses brain metastasis.

Brain metastasis linked to Cx43 gap junctions

Author Manuscript

GFAP-positive reactive astrocytosis is a hallmark of brain metastasis (Fig. 1a). Astrocytes
interact in a gap-junction network with connexin 43 (Cx43) one of the principal gap junction
proteins in these cells11. Cx43 is present in brain metastases, including cancer cell-astrocyte
interfaces (Fig 1a). In triple-negative breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
we found a higher level of Cx43 staining in brain metastases than in primary tumours or
normal tissues (Figure 1b, Extended Data Figure 1a). To characterize these cancer cellastrocyte interactions, we employed five brain metastatic models derived from mammary
(MDA231-BrM2, ErbB2-BrM) or lung adenocarcinomas (H2030-BrM3, 393N1, LLCBrM), of human or murine origin (Extended Data Fig. 1b)3,6,12,13. These lesions display
Cx43 expression at the cancer cell-astrocyte interface (Fig. 1c). In each of these models, coculture with astrocytes protected cancer cells from chemotherapy and the pro-apoptotic
cytokine FasL (Extended Data Fig. 1c), congruent with previous in vitro findings9 and
suggesting a dual role for astrocytes in brain metastasis.
Gap junctions are formed by hexameric connexin hemi-channels and allow for passage of
cytoplasmic molecules between cells14. We observed time-dependent transfer of calcein
from brain metastatic cells to astrocytes by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1d;
Supplementary Information Video S1), and from astrocytes to metastatic cells by flow
cytometry (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Fig. 1d). Astrocyte calcein transfer occurred more readily

with brain metastatic cells than with their parental counterparts (Fig. 1e). This phenotype
was not fully explained by brain metastatic cell expression of Cx43 (Fig. 1f, Extended Data
Fig. 2a,b) or other astrocytic connexins (Cx26, Cx30) (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Cx43
expression was higher in astrocytes than the brain metastatic cells (Fig. 1g, Extended Data
Fig. 2d).

Author Manuscript

Reasoning that cancer cells must use another component besides Cx43 to engage astrocytes,
we investigated PCDH7, one of a small group of genes upregulated in brain metastatic cells
from both breast and lung tumours3,6,12. Protocadherins are integral membrane proteins that
direct cell-cell contacts by homophilic interaction. PCDH7 (cadherin-related neuronal
receptor) is the sole protocadherin expressed predominantly in the brain15,16. PCDH7 levels
were higher in brain metastatic derivatives than in parental cell lines (Fig. 1f, Extended Data
Fig. 2a,b) or in matched derivatives highly metastatic to bone or lung but not brain (Fig. 1h;
refer to Extended Data Fig. 1b). The PCDH7 level in brain metastatic cells was higher than
in astrocytes, microglia or endothelial cells (Fig. 1g, Extended Data Fig. 2d).
In clinical cohorts of triple-negative breast cancer, expression of PCDH7 and Cx43 in
primary tumours was associated with brain, but not bone or lung metastasis (Fig. 1i). Up to
70% of relapses in patients with NSCLC include brain metastases17; contributing
disproportionately to survival18. Cx43 and PCDH7 expression was associated with
decreased metastasis-free survival of NSCLC patients in three cohorts (Fig. 1j, Extended
Data Fig. 2e). These results all support the relevance of PCDH7 and Cx43 in brain
metastasis.

PCDH7 directs carcinoma-astrocyte gap junctions
Author Manuscript

Brain-metastatic cells depleted of either PCDH7 or Cx43 with short hairpin RNAs (shRNA)
(Extended Data Fig. 2f,g) showed reduced capacity for dye transfer to astrocytes (Fig 2a,
Extended Data Fig. 3a), on par with the pan-connexin inhibitor, carbenoloxone (Extended
Data Fig 3b). Cadherins may establish homophilic binding between adjacent cells19. We
hypothesized that astrocyte PCDH7 might participate in the formation of gap junctions with
brain metastatic cancer cells, similar to gap junctions between astrocytomas and neighboring
astrocytes20,21. Indeed, PCDH7 depletion in astrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 3c) inhibited
dye transfer from MDA231-BrM2 cells (Extended Data Fig. 3d).

Author Manuscript

Human brain microvascular endothelilal cells (HBMECs) have no detectable PCDH7
expression and express low levels of Cx43 (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Despite low gap
junction communication between cancer cells and HBMECs (Extended Data Fig. 3e), dye
transfer between cancer cell and astrocyte was favored over dye transfer between cancer cell
and HBMEC (Extended Data Fig 3f). Primary microglia cells expressed very low levels of
Cx43 and PCDH7 and did not accept calcein from cancer cells (Extended Data Fig 3g).
Thus, PCDH7 directs cancer cells to preferentially form Cx43 gap junctions with astrocytes.
To detect CX43-PCDH7 interactions in live cells, we employed a split luciferase
complementation assay22. Constructs encoding PDCH7 and Cx43 fused to the N-terminal
(NLuc) and C-terminal (CLuc) halves of firefly luciferase were expressed in non-GFP-

luciferase labeled parental cells. When NLuc and CLuc cytoplasmic domains come into
proximity, luciferase activity is reconstituted (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Cx43 self-assembly
served as positive control. We detected specific luciferase activity in cells expressing both
Cx43-CLuc and PCDH7-NLuc (Extended Data Fig 4b), consistent with Cx43 and PCDH7
interaction within the same cell. The expression level of PCDH7 and Cx43 luciferase
chimeras was comparable to endogenous levels (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Astrocytes
increased luciferase signal in cancer cells after co-culture (Extended Data Fig. 4d)
suggesting that astrocyte Cx43 and PCDH7 induce further clustering of cancer cell Cx43CLuc and PCDH7-NLuc. No interaction was detected between Cx43-CLuc and N-cadherin
or E-cadherin fused with NLuc (Extended Data Fig. 4e-g).

Cx43 and PCDH7 mediate brain metastasis
Author Manuscript

shRNA-mediated depletion of either Cx43 or PCDH7 in breast cancer and lung cancer cells
inhibited brain metastases growth in both immunocompetent (Fig. 2b) and xenograft models,
(Fig 2c,d, Extended Data Figure 5a,b); this did not affect the formation of lung lesions
(Extended Data Fig. 5c).
The Cx43(T154A) mutant assembles hemichannels but lacks channel function23.
Cx43(T154A) re-expressed in Cx43-depleted brain metastatic cancer cells (Extended Data
Fig. 5d) was unable to mediate calcein transfer from astrocyte to MDA231-BrM cells (Fig.
2f). Wild-type Cx43 rescued brain metastatic activity in Cx43-depleted MDA231-BrM and
H2030-BrM cells, whereas Cx43(T154A) did not (Fig. 2g, Extended Data Fig. 5e). These
observations support a model whereby PCDH7 directly interacts with Cx43 to assemble
functional gap junctions between cancer cells and astrocytes (Fig. 2h).

Author Manuscript

We defined the stage at which PCDH7 and Cx43 contribute to the formation of brain
metastases using short-term metastasis assays with MDA231-BrM2 cells. In this model,
extravasation across the BBB is complete 7 days post-inoculation, vascular cooption and
overt outgrowth occur by day 146. Cx43 or PCDH7 depletion in the cancer cells did not
significantly diminish the number of GFP+ cancer cells in the brain parenchyma at day 7
(Extended Data Fig. 6a). Fourteen days after inoculation, micrometastases resulting from
Cx43- or PCDH7-depleted cells showed decreased proliferation (Extended Data Fig. 6b). In
ex-vivo brain slice assay6, Cx43- or PCDH7-depleted cells displayed increased cleaved
caspase 3 staining (Extended Data Fig. 6c) and maintained vascular contacts (Extended Data
Fig. 6d). Thus, cancer cell-astrocyte gap junction channels support brain metastasis growth
after extravasation and vascular cooption.

Cancer cells trigger astrocyte cytokine release
To determine the mechanism behind Cx43-mediated brain metastatic growth, we assayed
cancer cell gene expression by translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP)24
(Extended Data Fig 7a). We expressed the eGFP-tagged L10a ribosomal subunit in
MDA231-BrM2 cells with either basal or reduced Cx43 expression. After cancer cellastrocyte co-culture, we immunoprecipitated eGFP-tagged polysomes and sequenced the
associated mRNA (Extended Data Fig 7b-c). The gene expression patterns revealed that

interferon (IFN) and NF-κB pathways in brain metastatic cells were activated after astrocyte
co-culture in a Cx43-dependent manner (Fig. 3a). Conditioned media from the co-cultures
was sufficient to activate the IFN and NF-κB signaling in the cancer cells, as determined by
phosphorylation of STAT1 and NF-κB p65 (Fig. 3b, Extended Data Fig. 7d). Cx43 channel
function was required for this effect (Fig. 3c).

Author Manuscript

IFNα, TNFα and TGFα accumulated in conditioned media from MDA231-BrM2-astrocyte
co-cultures in a gap junction dependent manner (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 8a-b).
MDA231-BrM2, either alone or co-cultured with astrocytes, did not express these cytokines
by TRAP-RNAseq (data not shown). Upregulation of TNFα and TGFα mRNA was detected
in astrocytes re-isolated after co-culture (Extended Data Fig 8b). Addition of IFNα or TNFα
inhibited brain metastatic cancer cell apoptosis in response to chemotherapy (Extended Data
Fig. 8c). In two syngeneic mouse models, knock down of STAT1 in brain metastatic cells
(Extended Data Fig. 8d) reduced brain metastasis (Fig. 3e, Extended Data Fig. 8e).
Inhibition of NF-κB by overexpression of IκBα super suppressor (SR-IκBα)25 in brain
metastatic cells (Extended Data Fig. 8f) also suppressed brain metastasis (Fig. 3f). These
results suggest that heterocellular gap junction communication elicits production of IFNα
and TNFα in astrocytes, triggering STAT1 and NF-κB survival signals in cancer cells.

Cancer cells transfer cGAMP to astrocytes

Author Manuscript

Upregulation of both IFNα and TNFα was reminiscent of a cellular response to dsDNA26.
Cytosolic dsDNA triggers the cGAS-STING pathway, an innate immune response against
viral infection27, in which cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) senses cytosolic dsDNA and
synthesizes the second messenger 2’3’-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). cGAMP binding to
STING triggers phosphorylation and activation of TBK1 and IRF3, nuclear accumulation of
IRF3, and transcriptional activation of IRF3 target genes IFNA and TNFA10.
Co-incubation of MDA231-BrM2 cells and astrocytes triggered Cx43-dependent
phosphorylation of TBK1 and IRF3 (Fig 4a, Extended Data Fig. 9a). Nuclear accumulation
of IRF3 occurred only in co-cultured astrocytes, and not in either cell type alone (Fig. 4b).
STING knock down in mouse astrocytes (Extended Data Fig. 9b) inhibited their ability to
respond to mouse LLC-BrM cells with IRF3 phosphorylation (Fig. 4c), or IFNα and TNFα
production (Extended Data 9c), indicating the need for STING activity in astrocytes. We
inoculated LLC-BrM cells into syngeneic STING-mutant or wild-type C57Bl6 mice and
found that host STING inactivation suppressed brain metastasis by these cells (Fig. 4d,
Extended Data 9d).

Author Manuscript

We next investigated the source of astrocyte STING activation. Subcellular fractionation
(Extended Data Fig. 9e,f) and immunofluorsence (Extended Data Fig. 9g) showed cytosolic
dsDNA in human cancer cell lines and not in astrocytes and other non-neoplastic human
cells. We detected cGAMP by LC-MS/MS in MDA231-BrM2 cells, but not in astrocytes
(Fig. 4e, Extended Data Fig. 9h). Co-culture of MDA231-BrM2 cells with astrocytes further
increased cGAMP level in a Cx43-dependent manner (Fig. 4f). Given the presence of both
cytosolic dsDNA and cGAMP in cancer cells, we next identified which molecule was
responsible for astrocyte STING pathway activation. cGAS knockdown cancer cells

(Extended Data Fig. 9k) did not induce significant IRF3 phosphorylation (Fig 4g), TNFα or
IFNα production (Extended Data Fig 9l) in co-cultured astrocytes. Moreover, cGASdepletion in cancer cells led to reduced brain metastasis (Extended Data Fig. 9m).
Together, these results support a model whereby brain metastatic cancer cells contain
cytosolic dsDNA and cGAMP and engage astrocytes in Cx43-based gap junctions. The gap
junctions allow passage of cGAMP from cancer cells into astrocytes to trigger TBK1 and
IRF3 activation and production of IFNα and TNFα. These cytokines activate STAT1 and
NF-κB signaling in cancer cells to support cancer cell growth and survival under
microenvironmental and chemotherapeutic stresses (Fig. 4h).

Gap junction directed therapy
Author Manuscript

Genetic evidence that inhibition of gap junction signaling decreases brain metastasis
prompted testing pharmacologic suppressors of gap junction activity. In addition to antiinflammatory activity, meclofenamate inhibits Cx43 gap junction gating28 and inhibits
epileptogenesis in animal models.29 Tonabersat is a benzopyran derivative that binds to a
unique stereoselective binding site in astrocytes30,31 and inhibits gap-junction-mediated
processes including cortical spreading depression32 and trigeminal ganglion neuronalsatellite cell signaling.33 Both tonabersat and meclofenamate inhibited dye transfer from
astrocytes to cancer cells (Fig. 5a) and release of IFNα and TNFα in astrocyte cancer cell
co-cultures (Fig. 5b). Treatment with either compound inhibited brain metastases in
xenograft and immunecompetent models (Fig. 5c, Extended Data Fig. 10a-b, but did not
restrict lung metastasis (Extended Data Fig. 10c-d). Neither drug altered the astrocyte
response to cGAMP (Extended Data Fig 10e).

Author Manuscript

To test the effect of Cx43 or PCDH7 depletion in established metastases, we transduced
MDA231-BrM2 cells with doxycycline-inducible shRNA expression vectors (Fig. 5e,
Extended Data Fig. 10g). Red fluorescence protein (RFP) under the control of the same
promoter provided a marker of hairpin expression (Extended Data Fig. 10f). Doxycycline
treatment began fourteen days after inoculation (Extended Data Fig. 10h, Fig. 5d)3,6, and
reduced brain metastatic burden three weeks later (Fig. 5e,f).

Author Manuscript

Brain metastases show pronounced resistance to chemotherapy34. Carboplatin crosses the
BBB35, modestly improving overall survival in patients with brain metastases from breast36
or lung cancer37. Carboplatin alone (50 mg/kg/5 days) starting on day 14 inhibited brain
metastasis to a similar extent as Cx43 or PCDH7 depletion (Fig. 5e,f); combination
carboplatin and Cx43- or PCDH7-depletion further reduced metastatic burden (Fig. 5e,f).
Treatment with either tonabersat (10 mg/kg) or meclofenamate (20 mg/kg) as single agents
(Fig. 5g) significantly inhibited progression of metastatic lesions. Addition of carboplatin to
either agent profoundly inhibited brain metastasis (Fig. 5g).

Discussion
The brain represents a formidable metastatic target; astrocytes are a predominant feature. We
find that cancer cells employ PCDH7 to selectively engage astrocytes in vital Cx43 gap
junctions. Cadherins mediate cell-cell communication in development and tissue

homeostasis19, particularly in the nervous system38. Remarkably, brain metastatic cells
adopt a cadherin whose normal expression is largely confined to the brain15. PCDH7 joins
ST6GALNAC53, and neuroserpin6 as brain-restricted components that metastatic cells from
breast and lung carcinomas selectively express to colonize the brain. Functional Cx43-based
gap junctions between cancer cells and astrocytes allow cancer cells to disseminate cGAMP
to astrocytes. This activates the astrocytic cGAS-STING pathway and release of cytokines
including IFNα and TNFα, which provide a growth advantage for brain metastatic cells by
protecting against physiologic and chemotherapeutic stresses.

Author Manuscript

cGAMP transfer from cancer cell to astrocyte is reminiscent of cGAMP spread to adjacent
cells in the anti-viral context39,40 However, unlike homotypic transfer of cGAMP to
bystander cells to intensify immune response, brain metastatic cells shunt cGAMP into
neighboring host astrocytes to trigger downstream signaling that supports metastatic
outgrowth. This prometastatic process contrasts with previous reports of tumor STING
activation and subsequent host immune cell extracranial anti-tumor response41,42 and
highlights the profound impact of stromal context.
Brain metastases are a major contributor to cancer mortality, with few therapeutic options
available. Cancer cell dependency on Cx43/PCDH7 gap junctions for survival and outgrowth
of metastatic lesions suggests a therapeutic opportunity. Our pre-clinical results using
combinations of chemotherapy and gap junction modulators provide proof-of-principle for
the therapeutic potential of these interventions against brain metastasis.

METHODS
Cell culture

Author Manuscript

Human MDA-MB-231 (MDA231), murine MMTV-neu, murine LLC their metastatic
derivatives, and murine 373N1, 393N1, 482N1, 2691N1 cell lines were cultured in DMEM
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM L-Glutamine. Human H2030 cells and
metastatic derivatives were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS
and 2 mM LGlutamine. For lentivirus production, 293T cells were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM L-glutamine. Human primary
astrocytes, mouse primary astrocytes, brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC), adult
dermal fibroblasts, and microglia were cultured in media specified by the supplier
(ScienCell), and used between passages 2-6. All cells tested negative for micoplasma.
Animal studies

All experiments using animals were performed in accordance with protocols approved by
the MSKCC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Athymic NCR nu/nu mice
(NCI-Frederick), Cr:NIH bg-nu-xid mice (NCI-Frederick), B6129SF1/J, C57BL/6JTmem173gt/J43 “Golden Ticket”, and C57/Bl/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory) were used at
5-6 weeks of age. For long-term brain metastasis assays we followed previously described
procedures3. In brief, 1 × 104 MDA231-BrM2 cells, 5 × 104 H2030-BrM3 cells, 5 × 104
LLC-BrM or 1 × 105 393N1 cells suspended in 100 μl of PBS were injected into the left

xylazine 10 mg/kg) were injected retro-orbitally with D-luciferin (150mg/kg), prior to
euthanasia, dissection of brain and quantified by ex vivo Bio-luminescent imaging (BLI).
For short-term (7-day and 14-day) brain metastasis experiments, we introduced 5x105 cells.
Where relevant, TRITC dextran (70 KD) (Life Technologies) was intravenously injected to
stain vascular structures prior to dissection. For lung colonization assays, 2 × 105 MDA231BrM2 cells in 100 μL PBS were injected into the lateral tail vein. For orthotopic tumour
implantation, 5 × 103 cells in 50 μL of 1:1 mix of PBS/growth factor reduced matrigel (BD
Biosciences) were injected into the 4th right mammary fat pad of female mice. For inducible
knockdown experiments, mice were given doxycycline hyclate (Sigma-Aldrich) in the
drinking water (2 mg/mL) and the diet (Harlan) 14 days after injection of cancer cells. For
drug treatment experiments, mice were intraperitoneally injected with carboplatin (Hospira)
(50 mg/kg/5days), Tonabersat (MedChem Express)(10 mg/kg/day), or meclofenamic acid
sodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich) (20 mg/kg/day). Vehicle (10% DMSO in Polyethylene glycol
400) was used in control mice. Quantification of tumor burden was wuth bioluminescent
imaging (BLI). BLI was performed using an IVIS Spectrum Xenogen instrument (Caliper
Life Sciences) and analyzed using Living Image software, v. 2.50. Please refer to Source
Data file. A priori sample size determination for animal experiments was determined by
Mead's Resource Equation: 10 animals per treatment group in an experimental design of
three groups, without further stratification, gives 28 degrees of freedom, an adequate sample
size. Eight animals per treatment group gives 24 degrees of freedom, also acceptable.
Therefore, for brain metastasis assays, 8-10 mice were used in each group; exact numbers
for each experimental series are included in the relevant figure legends. For drug treatment
experiments, mice were inoculated with cancer cells and randomly assigned to treatment
groups. Mice dying less than 24 h after tumor inoculation were excluded from analysis. Gap
junction modulators and chemotherapeutic agents were blindly administered in the MSKCC
Antitumour Assessment Core.
Immunohistochemical staining

Author Manuscript

Mouse brains were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, sectioned by vibratome (Leica) or
cryostat (Leica) and stained following established protocols6. For brain slice assays6, 250
μm thick slices of adult mouse brain were prepared with a vibratome (Leica) and placed on
top of 0.8 μm pore membranes (Millipore) in brain slice culture medium (DMEM, complete
HBSS, 5% FBS, 1mM L-glutamine, 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin). 3 ×
105 cancer cells were placed on the surface of the slice. After 48 h of incubation, brain slices
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and stained. For immunostaining in chamber slide
cultures, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained. Antibodies used for
immunochemical staining are listed in Supplementary Information. Images were acquired
with Zeiss Axio Imager Z1 microscope or Leica SP5 upright confocal microscope, and
analyzed with ImageJ, Imaris and Metamorph softwares. Antibodies used for
immunostaining are listed in Supplementary Information.
Knockdown and overexpression constructs
For stable knockdown of Cx43, PCDH7, cGAS and STING, we used shRNAs in GiPZ
lentiviral vector. For inducible knockdown, shRNAs in TRIPZ lentivial vector were used. 1
μg/mL doxycycline hyclate (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to induce the expression of shRNA.

mRNA and protein detection

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was extracted using the PrepEase RNA spin kit (USB). To prepare cDNA, 1 μg
of total RNA was treated using the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche).
Cx43, Cx30 and Cx 26 expression was quantified by Taqman gene expression assay primers:
(Cx 43: Hs00748445_s1, Mm00439105_m1; Cx30: Hs00922742_s1, Mm00433661_s1;
Cx26: Hs00269615_s1, Mm00433643_s1; Applied Biosystems). Relative gene expression
was normalized relative to β2-microglobulin (Hs99999907_m1, Mm00437762_m1). The
PCDH7 primer pair was designed to detect all PCDH7 isoforms: 5’-agttcaacgtggtcatcgtg-3’
(sense), 5’-acaatcagggagttgttgctc-3’(antisense). Reactions were performed using SYBR
Green I Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative expression data were analyzed
using an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). For western
immunoblotting, cell pellets were lysed with RIPA buffer and protein concentrations
determined by BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Protein lysates of primary human astrocytes,
microglia and HBMEC were purchased from ScienCell. Proteins were separated by SDSPAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad). Antibodies used for western

Monolayers of cancer cells or astrocytes were labeled with 2.5 μg/ml calcein Red-Orange
AM dye (Life Technologies) at 37°C for 30 min. Single cell suspensions were mixed at a
ratio of 2:1 labeled:unlabeled cells for 6 h. Certain experiments used a mix of three cell
populations, MDA231-BrM2 (GFP+), HBMEC (pre-labeled with Cell Proliferating Dye
Fluor@670, eBioscience), and unlabeled astrocytes. Dye transfer was visualized by Zeiss
LSM 5 Live confocal microscopy (20-min time-lapse) or quantified by FACSCalibur flow
cytometry (BD Biosciences).
Cancer cell and astrocyte co-culture experiments

Author Manuscript

Astrocytes and cancer cells were mixed at ratio of 1:1. For apoptosis assays, overnight cocultures were treated with 500 ng/ml sFasL (Peprotech) in serum free media, 500 nM
carboplatin (Sigma-Aldrich) or 25 nM Paclitaxel (Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h. Single cell
suspensions were stained with APC-conjugated cleaved caspase 3 antibody (Cell Signaling),
apoptotic GFP+ cancer cells were detected by flow cytometery. For conditioned media
analysis, media were collected after 24 h, and cytokines in the conditioned media were either
identified using Human Cytokine Array (R&D systems) or measured by human or mouse
IFNα or TNFα ELISA kits (R&D systems) as relevant. To detect the activity of IFNα or
TNFα in the collected conditioned media, cancer cells were treated with the collected
conditioned media for 2 h and phosphorylation status of STAT1 or NF-κB p65 was
determined by western blotting. For cGAMP and TBI-IRF3 activation experiments, cancer
cells and astrocytes were co-cultured for 18 h. To stimulate astrocytes without co-culture,
astrocytes were transfected with cGAMP (4 μg/ml) with Lipofectamine 2000, according to
the manufacturer's protocol, as previously described.43 The phosphorylation status of TBK1,

IRF3 was determined by western immunoblotting. Nuclear translocation of IRF3 was
determined by immunofluorescence staining with Zeiss LSM 5 Live confocal microscopy.
cGAMP levels were determined by LC-MS/MS; Detailed methods for cGAMP detection
and quantification are described in Supplementary Information.
Translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP)
EGFP-L10a expressing cancer cells were co-cultured with astrocytes for 24 h. Following
previously published protocols,24,44 mRNA purified from cancer cells was used for library
construction with TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina) following the manufacturer's
instructions. Samples were barcoded and run on a Hiseq 2000 platform in a 50bp/50bp
paired-end run, using the TruSeq SBS Kit v3 (Illumina). An average of 50 million paired
reads were generated per sample. The data are deposited in NCBI GEO: GSE79256.

Cytokine treatment and pathway reporter assays
Cancer cells were treated with 10 units/ml (39 u/ng) recombinant IFNαA (R&D Systems) or
10 pg/ml recombinant TNFα (R&D Systems) in combination with carboplatin or Taxol
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h. Apoptosis was quantified by Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega).
For NFκB reporter assays, the NF-κB responsive sequence from the pHAGE NFKB-TALUC-UBC-dTomato-W construct (Addgene)45 was cloned into a pGL4.82 Renilla luciferase
reporter (Promega). Cancer cells were co-transfected with this vector and a LeGO-C2
mCherry vector (Addgene). Renilla luciferase activity was determined using RenillaGlo
Luciferase system (Promega). Red fluorescence signal was used to normalize transfection
efficiency.
Split luciferase assay

Author Manuscript

Fusion cDNAs were generated by deleting the stop codon in human Cx43 (Origene),
PCDH7 (Origene), E-cadherin (Addgene) or N-cadherin (Addgene) cDNAs and splicing the
N-terminal or C-terminal fragment of firefly luciferase22. (Addgene). Constructs were
cloned into pLVX lentiviral expression vector and transduced into non-GFP-luciferaselabeled parental MDA-MB-231 or H2030 cells. To detect luciferase activity, 7.5 mg/ml Dluciferin potassium salt was added in the culture media. BLI was performed by IVIS
Spectrum Xenogen instrument, using Living Image software v.2.50.
Cytosolic dsDNA detection

Author Manuscript

For visualization of dsDNA, cells were immunostained with anti-dsDNA antibody. AntiGFP staining was used to delineate cancer cell bodies, DAPI to distinguish nuclei, and antiCoxIV antibody (a mitochondrial marker) to distinguish mitochondria. Phalloidin staining
(Molecular Probe) was used to delineate astrocyte cell bodies. For quantification of dsDNA,
nuclear, cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were prepared using a mitochondria isolation
kit (Thermo Scientific). DNA from all subcellular fractions was purified by QIAamp DNA
mini kit (Qiagen) and quantified by QuantoFluor dsDNA system (Promega).

Bioinformatic and statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

Bioinformatic analysis was performed in R (ver. 3.1.2) unless otherwise noted. The data
were analyzed using the TopHat2-HTSeq-DESeq2 pipeline46-48. Differential gene
expression was compared with cooksCutoff and independentFiltering turned off. Scatter plot
showing fold changes was produced using the ggplot2 package. Principal component
analysis (PCA) was performed using prcomp. Pathway gene response signatures were
analyzed and scored by the sum of z-score method 44, as previously described12,49. Multiple
hypothesis testing was adjusted using the Benjamini & Hochberg false-discovery-rate
method. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad software (Prism) and Student's ttest (two-tailed). P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Values are averages
± standard error of the mean (S.E.M.).
Clinical sample analysis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

All tissues were obtained from the MSKCC Department of Pathology in compliance with
the MSKCC Institutional Review Board under Biospecimen Research Protocol 15-204.
Informed consent was obtained from all subjects. CX43 and PCDH7 transcript levels were
analyzed in the microarray data of primary breast cancer (EMC-MSK) and adenocarcinoma
datasets (MSKCC set2, GSE3141 and GSE8893). Multiple probes mapping to the same
gene were combined by selecting the probe with maximal variance across samples. Triplenegative breast cancer subtypes were identified either based on clinical annotation of the
data set or on ESR1 and ERBB2 transcript levels. The hazard ratio of the CX43 and PCDH7
values was computed based on Cox proportional hazards model, as implemented by the
“coxph” command in R. P values were calculated from a Cox proportional hazard model,
with CX43 and PCDH7 expression treated as a continuous variable. For Cx43
immunohistochemistry, normal lung tissue array (75 cases), primary triple negative breast
cancer tissue array (98 cases) and primary non-small cell lung carcinoma tissue array (138
cases) were purchased from US Biomax. Paraffin embedded tissue microarrays from brain
metastases (117 case of triple-negative breast cancer, 91 cases of non-small cell lung
carcinoma) were obtained from the MSKCC Department of Pathology.
Immunohistochemical staining for Cx43 was performed by the MSKCC Pathology Core
Facility using standardized, automated protocols. For matched primary-brain metastatic
lesions, Cx43 staining was quantified by positive staining area (Metamorph software).
