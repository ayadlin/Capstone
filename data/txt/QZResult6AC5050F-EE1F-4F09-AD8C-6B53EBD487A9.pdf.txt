ABSTRACT
Recent research has shown that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B-cells
display a strong tendency to differentiate into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) and thus
may be amenable to differentiation therapy. However, the effect of this differentiation
on factors associated with CLL pathogenesis has not been reported. In the present
study, purified CLL B-cells were stimulated to differentiate into ASCs by phorbol
myristate acetate or CpG oligodeoxynucleotide, in combination with CD40 ligand and
cytokines in a two-step, seven-day culture system. We investigated (i) changes in
the immunophenotypic, molecular, functional, morphological features associated
with terminal differentiation into ASCs, (ii) the expression of factors involved in
CLL pathogenesis, and (iii) the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins in
the differentiated cells. Our results show that differentiated CLL B-cells are able to
display the transcriptional program of ASCs. Differentiation leads to depletion of the
malignant program and deregulation of the apoptosis/survival balance. Analysis of
apoptosis and the cell cycle showed that differentiation is associated with low cell
viability and a low rate of cell cycle entry. Our findings shed new light on the potential
for differentiation therapy as a part of treatment strategies for CLL.

treatment strategies for combination with these agents are still
needed for CLL.
Gene expression profiling has been used to
characterize CLL-cells and identified several genes whose
expression differs between CLL B-cells and normal B-cells
including lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1),
receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1),
fibromodulin (FMOD), T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1
(TCL1), Ataxin (ATXN1), early B-cell factor 1 (EBF1)
and p27 [5–10] (see also the open web ATLAS (http://
amazonia.transcriptome.eu/index.php?zone=HematologyCLL). LEF1 plays an important role in early normal B-cell
differentiation, and is normally expressed in pro-B-cells but

INTRODUCTION
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a hetero­
geneous disease characterized by clonal proliferation and
the accumulation of mature CD5+ B-cells in lymphoid
tissues, bone marrow, and peripheral blood. The standard
treatment approach is chemoimmunotherapy that leads to
significant toxicity and life-threatening immunosuppression,
and most patients will relapse [1, 2]. A number of targeted
therapies appear to have promise in treating CLL (such as
Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) and the delta isoform of
phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3Kδ) inhibitors [1, 2] and BCL2
family inhibitors [3, 4]). Nevertheless, novel, effective, safe

not in mature B-cells and plasma cell [11, 12]. LEF1 and
ROR1 are expressed in the preleukemic state of monoclonal
B-cell lymphocytosis [12, 13] and highly upregulated in
CLL B-cells but not normal B-cells and promote leukemic
cells growth and survival [12, 14]. TCL1 expression is
high in naïve B-cells and absent in memory B-cells and
plasma cells [15]. TCL1 was shown to be directly involved
in the pathogenesis of CLL and to interact with ROR1
and accelerates development and progression of CLL
[13, 16,  17]. FMOD has been found to be highly
overexpressed in CLL [6, 18] and its expression is
associated with the presence of risk factors [19].
Importantly, it has been shown that LEF1 [11, 12],
ROR1 or FMOD knockdown by small interfering RNA
induces apoptosis in CLL B-cells [20]. The Cdk inhibitor
p27 (a negative regulator of cell cycle progression) is
overexpressed in CLL-cells and confers resistance to cell
death [21, 22]. Transmembrane activator and calcium
modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI)
(encoded by TNFRSF13B) has an important role in B-cell
survival, activation, and differentiation [23]. Very recently,
it was shown that the prosurvival effect mediated by a
proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) in CLL B-cells
depends on TACI and that the APRIL/TACI interaction
significantly accelerates the development of CLL in TCL1
transgenic mice [13, 23]. In CLL, but not in other B-cell
malignancies, the BCR was shown to signal autonomously
[24]. Pre-existing BCR signaling pathways are critical in
the pathogenesis of CLL and have an important role by
promoting CLL B-cells survival and proliferation [1, 22,
25, 26]. Furthermore, targeting BCR signaling pathways
by siRNA molecules or kinases inhibitors in vitro induces
downregulation of anti-apoptotic protein myeloid cell
leukemia 1 (MCL1) and consequently CLL B-cells
apoptosis [26–28]. All these molecules are involved in the
pathogenesis of CLL and constitute a part of the malignant
program of CLL B-cells [5–10].
The “differentiation therapy” concept for cancer in
general requires the development of systems that remove
the molecular blocks that prevent malignant cells from
maturing into differentiated or normal cells, which no
longer grow uncontrollably [29–32]. Thus, reprograming
cancer cells to undergo terminal differentiation will result
in the loss of proliferative capacity and/or induction
of apoptosis [29–32]. Hence, differentiation therapy
has been mentioned as a potentially promising way
of treating CLL [14, 29, 33–36]. This type of targeted
therapy might restore the terminal differentiation program
in CLL B-cells and thus avoid the cytotoxicity and
complications associated with chemotherapy. Indeed,
differentiation therapy has been used successfully in
the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia [31, 37].
However, successful differentiation therapies for CLL
have yet to enter the clinic, despite encouraging results
in relatively few preclinical studies [29, 38, 39]. The
terminal differentiation of B-cells into antibody-secreting
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

plasma cells is a highly regulated differentiation process
that involves profound changes in the B-cells’ gene
expression profile [40–44] (http://amazonia.transcriptome.
eu/index.php?zone=PlasmaCell). We hypothesized that
differentiation of CLL B-cells into antibody-secreting cells
(ASCs) would be associated with the downregulation of
genes involved in the physiopathology of CLL and are
expressed (or not) in mature B-cells (e.g. LEF1 and TCL1)
but are poorly expressed or not expressed in ASCs.
CLL B-cells are thought to have an arrested B-cell
differentiation program. However, there is now renewed
interest in studying the differentiation capacity of CLL B-cells
[14, 33–36]. Recent research has shown that CLL B-cells
display a strong tendency to differentiate into ASCs and may
thus be amenable to differentiation therapy [14, 29, 33–35].
In a two-step, 7-day culture system, our laboratory recently
demonstrated that phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and CpG
oligodeoxynucleotide induces differentiation of CLL B-cells
to an intermediate stage in the plasma cell differentiation
process [34, 35]. Using a similar culture systems, in
this study we sought to investigate the impact of B-cell
differentiation on the expression of factors that contribute
to the physiopathology of CLL and/or are known to be
deregulated in CLL B-cells (including LEF1, TCL1, ROR1,
FMOD, TACI, PI3K, BTK and p27). We also investigated
changes in the expression of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins
in ASCs, including MCL1, p53-upregulated modulator of
apoptosis (PUMA), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein
(XIAP), B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and B-cell lymphomaextra-large (BCLxL).

RESULTS
1- Morphologic, immunophenotypic and
functional characterization of the resulting ASCs
from CLL B-cells synergistically stimulated with
PMA and CD40L (PMA/CD40L/c system)
In our previous work, we have characterized
in a similar two-step, seven-day culture model the
differentiation of CLL B-cells stimulated separately by
PMA and CD40L [34]. As CD40L-CD40 interactions
and cytokines are important components of the CLL
microenvironment, in the present study, we studied
the CLL B-cells’ ability to differentiate into antibodysecreting plasma cells after stimulation with PMA at the
same time as with CD40L. On D0, CLL B-cells were
stimulated with PMA and CD40L, in combination with
the cytokines IL-2, IL-10 and IL-15. On D4, cells were
harvested and incubated with IL-2, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-15
for 3 days. We first investigated the morphological and
functional features of the generated ASCs. After seven
days of culture in our system, the CLL B-cells acquired
an ASC-like morphology, characterized by an eccentric
nucleus and well-developed cytoplasm (Figure 1A). These
morphological changes were associated with the secretion

of large amounts of IgM into the culture supernatant
(Figure 1B). IgA and IgG were also detected, albeit at
relatively low levels (Figure 1B). These data indicate that
CLL B-cells had differentiated into ASCs.
We next looked at changes in the cell phenotype
at D7 (Figure 2A). Consistent with classical plasma cell
phenotype, the surface expression of CD19, CD20, CD5
and CD45 was lower for the generated cells than for
D0 CLL B-cells (5.4-, 8-, 3.2- and 6-fold, respectively).
Plasma cells are characterized by a downregulation or
lack of CD20 expression. On D7, 53 ± 22% of ASCs were
CD20-negative. The expression of CD27 and CD184
was significantly downregulated (7.2- and 9.6-fold,
respectively), whereas the expression of HLADR was
significantly upregulated (1.6-fold). The expression of
CD38 was not significantly upregulated (2-fold). However,
significant upregulation of surface and cytoplasmic
IgM expression was observed on D7 (6.4- and 2.6-fold,
respectively) (Figure 2A). Furthermore, the cells showed
significantly upregulated transcription of the plasma cell
marker genes [43] Gas6 (800-fold) and CD138 (5.2-fold)
on D7 (Figure 2B). CD138 expression was also studied
by flow cytometry. However, CD138 was not detected on
the cell surface (data not shown). Nevertheless, there were
no statistically significant differences between mutated
and unmutated CLL samples in terms of morphological
features, IgM secretion, immunophenotype and Gas6 and
CD138 gene expression changes. The fragment analysis
and sequencing of the complementarity-determining
region 3 of IgH and IgL gene rearrangements (performed
on D0 and D7) showed that cells were still clonal after
differentiation (Supplementary Figure 1).

expansion of the ER, the increase in protein synthesis and
the upregulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR)
[41, 43]. These changes are required for high levels
of antibody production and secretion. Recently, it was
shown that IRF4 assembles cooperatively with BATF and
coordinates the transcriptional program required for the
differentiation of peripheral B-cells into ASCs [45, 46]. In
our cells, BATF expression was significantly upregulated
(15-fold) (Figure 3A).
The second step of our differentiation system
includes stimulation with cytokines such as IL-6 and IL10 known to be involved in human ASC differentiation
[41, 47, 48]. These cytokines induce the expression of
the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) [49], BATF [50] and
the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
(STAT3), and are also involved in STAT3 activation [51].
The expression of STAT3 and HSP90 is critical for the
differentiation and function of ASCs [47, 51, 52]. STAT3
induces BLIMP1 expression [47], which represses the
expression of PAX5, BCL6 and c-MYC [47, 51, 53].
STAT3 can bind to the HSP90 promoter and induces its
expression [49]. At D7, the expression of STAT3 and its
activating tyrosine kinase TYK2 [54] and HSP90 was
clearly upregulated in generated-ASC (2.2-, 7.6- and
1.9-fold, respectively) whereas the expression of c-MYC
was clearly downregulated (4.5-fold) (Figure 3B). Thus,
by analogy with the terminal differentiation program of
normal B-cells into plasma cells, CLL B-cells increased
their STAT3, IRF4, XBP1s and BLIMP1 expression and
decreased their c-MYC, PAX5, BCL6, IRF8 and BACH2
expression. These findings correlates with our previous
results and other literature data [14, 33–36], suggesting
that CLL B-cells (i) are able to restore the transcriptional
program associated with plasma cell differentiation if
appropriate stimulation is provided [34–36] and (ii)
display relevant ASC features, including morphological
changes, UPR induction [34] and initiation of secretory
function.

2- ASCs generated from CLL B-cells display the
classical plasma cell transcription program
We next analyzed the molecular mechanisms
involved in the terminal differentiation of B-cells into
plasma cells in PMA/CD40L/c system. Cells were
monitored at D0 and D7 by studying mRNA expression
of the B-cell transcription factors PAX5, BCL6, IRF8 and
BACH2 (Figure 3A) and the plasma cell transcription
factors IRF4, Basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATFlike (BATF), PRDM1/BLIMP1 and XBP1s, by quantitative
RT-PCR (Figure 3A). On D7, the transcriptional
expression of PAX5, BCL6, IRF8 and BACH2 was
significantly downregulated (6.5-, 5.5-, 7.3- and 9-fold
respectively), whereas, the transcriptional expression of
IRF4, PRDM1, and XBP1s were significantly upregulated
(13-, 18- and 5.3-fold respectively) (Figure 3A). The
increase in BLIMP1 expression (15.6-fold) (Figure 3B)
was confirmed by Western blotting and that of IRF4 (7.4fold) was confirmed by Western blotting (Figure 3B)
and flow cytometry (Supplementary Figure 2). BLIMP1
(the master regulator of plasma cell differentiation) and
the spliced form of XBP1 (XBP1s) are involved in the

3- Differentiation of CLL B-cells induces changes
in the expression of CLL-pathogenesis-associated
factors
We next investigated the effect of CLL B-cell
differentiation in PMA/CD40L/c system on the expression
of factors associated with CLL pathogenesis, including
LEF1, TCL1, ROR1, FMOD, TNFRSF13B/TACI, BIRC5/
survivin [55], p27, PI3K and BTK. Furthermore, we also
measured expression of factors that are deregulated in
CLL but that are not known to be directly involved in
the pathogenesis of CLL (including Ataxin (ATXN1)
[6, 7], FCER2/CD23 [6, 7], early B-cell factor 1 (EBF1)
[7], myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate
(MARCKS) [8] and Ly9/CD229 [56].
Quantitative RT-PCRs showed that differentiation of
CLL B-cells into ASCs induces significant downregulation

of LEF1 (7.4-fold), TCL1 (8.2-fold), ROR1 (8-fold),
TNFRSF13B/TACI (9.8-fold) and FMOD (8.1-fold)
(Figure 4A). In contrast, BIRC5/survivin expression was
significantly induced (21-fold) (Figure 4A). However,
there was no significant effect on the expression of
FCER2, Ly9/CD229 and EBF1 (Figure 4A). Immunoblot
results confirmed the qRT-PCR data for downregulation
of LEF1 (8.6-fold), ROR1 (6.3-fold), FMOD (5.5-fold),
and upregulation of survivin (14-fold), and evidenced
downregulation of p27 (8.5-fold), PI3K (9.9-fold) and
BTK (5.4-fold) (Figure 4B). These observations suggest
that the differentiation of CLL B-cells into ASCs is
associated with downregulated expression of CLLpathogenesis-associated proteins, including LEF1, TCL1,
ROR1, FMOD, TNFRSF13B, PI3K, BTK and p27.

BCLxL, MCL1, XIAP and PUMA in the generated ASCs.
As shown in Figure 5B, no changes in the expression
of BCL2 were detected, whereas downregulation of
MCL1 and XIAP (7.4-fold and 4.3-fold, respectively)
and upregulation of BCLxL and PUMA (4-fold and 13fold, respectively) were observed. In order to determine
whether the changes in expression of BCLxL and PUMA
were specifically related to the differentiation process,
we investigated their expression in non-stimulated cells
(i.e. medium only). In contrast to differentiated cells, we
observed clear downregulation of BCLxL expression and
slight upregulation of PUMA expression in non-stimulated
cells (Supplementary Figure 3).
Importantly, PUMA was recently shown to be
involved in ER-stress induced apoptosis and to regulate
the maintenance of XBP1 mRNA splicing [58]. Indeed,
the downregulation of MCL1 and XIAP and the
upregulation of PUMA in the generated-ASCs suggest
that cell death is associated with the differentiation of
CLL B-cells. Nevertheless, recent studies suggest that
BCLxL promotes the survival of recently generated/shortlived ASCs [4, 57], whereas high expression of MCL1
is needed to promote the survival of long-lived ASCs
[43, 48, 57]. Furthermore, ASCs generated in this work,
dramatically reduced the expression of TNFRSF13B/TACI
and CXCR4/CD184 (Figure 2A and Figure 4A) that are
critical for the survival of human long-lived ASCs [48,
57]. On this basis, we conclude that the ASCs generated
in our culture system are short-lived ASC. However, the
downregulation of MCL1 could also be explained by the
decreased expression of Wnt pathway molecules (LEF1
and ROR1), TCL1, BCR signaling molecules (PI3K and
BTK) and c-MYC that were shown to positively regulate
MCL1 expression to promote CLL B-cells survival [11,
14, 28].
In contrast to the majority of human tumors,
CLL B-cells are arrested in the G0-G1 phase of the
cell cycle [21]. We therefore examined the in vitro
cell cycle distribution of the generated ASCs and the
expression of Ki67. Our analysis revealed a significant
increase in cycling cells between D0 and D7, however,
the mean percentage of cycling cells on D7 itself was
remarkably low (3 ± 1.2%) (Figure 6A). These results
correlated with those obtained with Ki67 staining that
show a percentage of 8 ± 3% of Ki67-positive cells
at D7 (Figure 6B). These cycling cells might have
downregulated p27 and upregulated survivin [22, 40,
48]. However, this low percentage of cycling cells on
D7 could be explained by (i) the repression by BLIMP1
of factors associated with cell cycle and BCR signaling,
such as BCL6, c-MYC and BTK [40, 41, 53] and (ii)
the fact that cell cycle entry is rendered irrelevant by
cell death due to the differentiation. Nevertheless, cell
death and proliferation were also assessed in a trypan
blue assay at D0, D4 and D7. As shown in Figure

4- Differentiation of CLL B-cells into ASCs
in PMA/CD40L/c system is associated with
incidence of apoptosis but not with exaggerated
cell proliferation
We next examined the cell cycle distribution
and apoptosis of cells in vitro. Indeed, normal B-cell
differentiation gives rise to both short-lived and longlived ASCs [42, 44, 53]. Long-lived ASCs reside in the
bone marrow, where survival signals are provided by the
environment and maintain long-term antibody production.
Short-lived ASCs are rapidly formed from extrafollicular
foci in secondary lymphoid organs, where they undergo
apoptosis after a few days of intensive antibody secretion
(mainly of low-affinity IgM Abs but also isotypeswitched Abs). During plasma cell differentiation, the
accumulation of misfolded proteins (due to the synthesis
of large amounts of antibodies) leads to increase in ER
stress. Failure of the UPR to reduce the load of unfolded
proteins leads to excessive ER stress followed by cell
death. Furthermore, plasma cell differentiation requires the
regulation of proliferation and is probably associated with
irrevocable cell cycle exit [47, 51, 53]. Indeed, short-lived
ASCs die soon after completing differentiation and exiting
cell cycle [44, 53, 57].
On D7, an Annexin-V/7AAD survival assay
revealed apoptosis among the generated ASCs (53 ±
24% of the cells had survived, on average; Figure 5A).
Importantly, it was shown very recently that the balance
between pro-survival and pro-apoptotic proteins is
perturbed during ASC differentiation [4, 40]. Specifically,
expression of anti-apoptotic proteins (including BCL2
and MCL1) is downregulated, and expression of proapoptotic proteins is upregulated [4]. These changes
lead to a reduction in the cell’s apoptotic threshold [4].
However, the researchers also showed that during ASC
differentiation, cells are saved from differentiationassociated death signals by BCLxL upregulation [4,
40]. We therefore examined the expression of BCL2,

6C, differentiation was associated with a decrease in
the viable cell count and an increase in the dead cell
count. Taken as a whole, our findings suggest that the
differentiation of CLL B-cells into ASCs is associated
with incidence of apoptosis but not exaggerated cell
proliferation.

by CpG oligodeoxynucleotide. Quantitative RT-PCRs
showed that the differentiation of CLL B-cells into ASCs
induced significant downregulation of LEF1 (5.3-fold),
TCL1 (8.2-fold), ROR1 (7-fold), TNFRSF13B/TACI (8fold) and FMOD (3.9-fold) (Figure 7A), and significant

differentiation.

DISCUSSION

of these factors - suggesting that restoring the terminal
differentiation program in CLL B-cells may lead to the
suppression of their malignant program. The resulting
ASCs might be less malignant or non-malignant, and
would thus fail to sustain malignant growth. Importantly,
differentiation of CLL B-cells into ASCs was associated
with a decrease in cell survival but not with massive
cell proliferation - suggesting that differentiation
might be an effective therapy for this mature B-cell
malignancy. However, future research should focus on the
leukemogenicity and pathogenicity of the generated ASCs
in animal models and should establish whether these cells
are no longer able to cause disease.
In addition to differentiation-dependent apoptosis,
differentiation therapy in CLL could potentially be
combined with other targeted therapies or immunotherapy

The concept whereby malignant B-cells are induced
to differentiate into a more mature, non-malignant or
less malignant state is clinically plausible and can be a
promising strategy as differentiation therapy in CLL [14,
29, 33–35]. To the best of our knowledge, the present
report is the first to demonstrate the modulatory effects
of differentiation on factors that have an important role in
physiopathology of CLL, including LEF1, TCL1, ROR1,
FMOD, TNFRSF13B, PI3K, BTK, p27, BCL2, BCLXL,
PUMA and MCL1. Many of these factors distinguish
CLL B-cells from normal mature B-cells and represent
a significant proportion of the malignant program in
CLL B-cells. Here, we showed that differentiation of
CLL B-cells into ASCs leads to decreased expression

[35]. Indeed, terminal differentiation confers exquisite
apoptotic sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors, inhibitors
of the ER stress-associated pathway (IRE1/XBP1) [59,
60], inhibitors of HSP90 [61], BCL2, BCLxL (e.g. ABT199 and ABT-737) [3, 4] and survivin [55]. As we have
shown here and in recent work [34], levels of these targets
(e.g. BCLxL and survivin) are exacerbated by terminal
differentiation of leukemic cells; indeed, a number of
the corresponding inhibitors appear to have potential as
treatments for CLL [3, 4, 55, 59–61]. It may be of value
to target the disruption of the fragile balance between
pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins that occurs during
differentiation. Given the central role of BCLxL in this
balance, we speculate that differentiation will sensitize
cells to BCLxL inhibitors [4, 57]. Furthermore, the
cellular and molecular microenvironment (manipulated by
leukemic cells themselves) confers a selective advantage
on CLL B-cells and enables disease progression. CLL
pathogenesis, survival, progression and resistance to
therapy are influenced by microenvironmental stimuli
such as BCR ligation, cell-cell interaction and soluble
factor [22, 25, 62]. The changes in intra- and extracellular
signaling pathways induced by differentiation of CLL
B-cells might restrict the latter’s dependency on their
microenvironment and deprive them of survival and
growth stimuli. Thus, the downregulation of CXCR4
and TACI induced by differentiation of CLL B-cells may
deprive the cells of survival mediators including the TACI
ligands BAFF and APRIL and the CXCR4 ligand CXCL12
[48, 57]. We speculate that in CLL, differentiation therapy
would have the advantage of inducing direct changes
in CLL B-cells; this would increase their sensitivity
to death signals, render them less dependent on their
microenvironment and enhance their sensitivity to targeted
or immuno-therapies.
Proliferation and apoptosis process are involved
in the differentiation of B-cells into ASCs [63]. Plasma
cell differentiation requires the regulation of proliferation
and is probably associated with irrevocable cell cycle
exit [53]. Indeed, it is questionable whether plasma cell
differentiation can occur in the absence of cell division
[53]. We think that cells may need to divide at least once
before they can differentiate into ASCs. Passage through
the cell cycle will probably enable the molecular and
epigenetic modifications required for differentiation [53,
63]. Indeed, cell cycle entry in our culture (3 ± 1.2%
for PMA/CD40L/c system, 5 ± 3.6% for CpG/CD40L/c
system) is very low in comparison with that observed
for differentiating cells in a normal human B-cell
differentiation system (between 15% and 35% in S-phase)
[41, 64–67]. However, as pointed out above, it will be
important to study the leukemogenicity and pathogenicity
of these cells in an animal model.
Our culture system is not optimized for clinical
use. In particular, our culture method is constrained

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

by its two-step configuration and the varied number of
cytokines used. We are in an in vitro context; we were
mainly concerning about finding optimal differentiation
conditions. Our differentiation model was based on
terminal differentiation culture systems for normal B-cells
guaranteeing optimal differentiation conditions [41, 64–
68]. Nevertheless, the CLL microenvironment includes
CD40L (from activated T-cells) and microenvironmentderived cytokines (secreted by dendritic cells, T-cells,
stroma cells and nurse-like cells) [69, 70]. Moreover, the
differentiation of CLL cells into ACSs has been shown
to occur spontaneously in vivo [71–74]. Furthermore,
stimulation of CLL B-cells with CpG was shown to induce
autocrine IL-6 and IL-10 production [75]. Exposure
to these factors and a differentiation-promoting agent
might create a favorable environment for the terminal
differentiation of CLL B-cells in vivo. Recent studies
have identified critical role for IL-21 in terminal human
B-cells differentiation into ASC. The effect of IL-21 on
terminal B-cell differentiation was found to exceed that
of IL-2, IL-4, IL-13, and IL-10 by up to 100-fold [76].
However, the effect of IL-21 could be potentiated by these
cytokines [76]. Moreover, very recently it was shown that
CpG and IL-21 are interesting differentiation-promoting
agents in CLL cells [14, 33]. There is a large body of
research in favor of TLR9-targeted therapy for CLL [77,
78]. The TRL9-ligand CpG induces the differentiation
and apoptosis of CLL B-cells [14, 33, 35, 75]. Indeed, in
agreement with our results, Gutierrez [14] have shown
that CLL B-cells induced to differentiate into ASCs by
CpG show low levels of LEF1 expression and decreased
activation of Wnt pathway. LEF1 and ROR1 are important
effectors of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway that
controls cell growth, survival and differentiation [11,
16]. Indeed, LEF1 and ROR1 are expressed by a variety
of human cancers including melanoma, colorectal
cancer, pancreatic cancer and lung cancer [11, 12, 79].
Importantly, we and others [35, 78, 80] have shown that
CpG treatment of CLL B-cells induces the upregulation
of CD20 expression. We speculate that CpG treatment
can increase the sensitivity of CLL cells to anti-CD20
therapy. Sagiv-Barfi et al [81] very recently developed
an interesting approach for treating lymphoma in mouse
model by combining active immunotherapy and targeted
kinase inhibition. Injection of intratumoral CpG and
systemic treatment with ibrutinib resulted in the full,
permanent regression of both local and distant tumors.
Phorbol myristate acetate is a polyclonal activator of
normal B-cells and CLL B-cells [34, 82]. Our unpublished
data and previously published data [82] show that PMA
has a specific differentiation effect on CLL B-cells and
has no effect on other B-cell malignancies. PMA activates
the PKC pathway by mimicking diacylglycerol (a natural
PKC ligand and activator) [83, 84]. The mediation, by
PKC, of the PMA-dependent activation and differentiation

Figure 8: Differentiation therapy would have the advantage of inducing direct changes in CLL B-cells. Differentiation
of CLL B-cells into antibody-secreting cells leads to depletion of malignant program and deregulation of the apoptosis/survival balance.
Differentiation of CLL B-cells may facilitate sensitivity towards targeted therapy such as BCL2 family inhibitors (ABT-737 and ABT-199),
survivin inhibitors (YM155) and heat shock protein (HSP) inhibitors.

of B-cells has been demonstrated in experiments using an
inhibitor of PKC [85, 86]. Phorbol ester has been proposed
and tested as potential therapeutic agent in pre-clinical
and clinical models [32, 84, 87, 88]. Indeed, studies in
patients with hematological malignancies evidenced the
feasibility of PMA administration resulting in therapeutic
responses [32, 88]. The role of PKC in inducing CLL
B-cells differentiation was also demonstrated with another
activator of the PKC pathway “bryostatin” which lack
carcinogenic potential [39, 89]. Clinical trials have shown
that bryostatin has moderate activity as a single agent
or when combined with fludarabine in the treatment of
CLL [39, 90]. Given that levels of some target molecules
(BCL-XL, survivin, and factors in the ER stress-associated
pathway) increase during the differentiation process
of CLL B-cells, we speculate that bryostatin might be
usefully combined with the corresponding inhibitors
of these molecules (ABT-737 [3], YM155 [55] and
B-I09 [59]).

CLL is characterized by an important immunological
dysfunction including immunoglobulin production. Over
60% of patients develop hypogammaglobulinaemia
during the course of CLL, leading to recurrent infections
(the most common cause of death in this disease) [91].
Moreover, low levels of immunoglobulin and complement
may decrease the clearance of auto antigens (apoptotic
antigens), with the subsequently increased risk of
autoimmunity. Indeed, in nine out of eleven patients,
serum IgM levels were below the normal range (Table 1).
One can reasonably hypothesize that differentiation of
CLL B-cells into ASCs will be a useful way of restoring
levels of Ig (IgM, at least) in CLL. However, as we and
other have shown [34, 35, 92], in some cases of CLL,
the IgMs produced may display auto/polyreactivity
and thus may induce autoimmune disease. Importantly,
pathogenic autoantibodies in CLL are polyclonal and
seem to be produced by residual nonmalignant B-cells
[93]. Nevertheless, the affinity of antibodies might be

MATERIALS AND METHODS

too low to trigger an autoimmune response; rather, the
antibodies produced might bind to invading pathogens and
provide a first line of humoral defense against infection
and/or might be involved in various homeostatic functions
(clearance of apoptotic cells and tumor cells), acting as
natural antibodies [92, 94]. Indeed, it has been shown that
CLL BCRs bind to apoptotic antigens as well as antigenic
determinants of bacterial capsules and toxins or viral coats
and fungi [92, 94–96].
Lastly, the suppression of expression of the malignant
program and the deregulation of the apoptosis/survival
balance observed during the terminal differentiation of
CLL B-cells emphasizes that differentiation therapy might
be effective in CLL (Figure 8). Furthermore, analysis of the
molecular mechanisms during CLL B-cells differentiation
might provide selective and targeted molecules for novel
treatment strategies (Figure 8). Our findings [34, 35] and
those of others [14, 33, 36] form a rational basis for the
further development of differentiation therapy in CLL.
This approach should be facilitated by the availability of
interesting agents (such as CpG) [14, 35] but above all by
(i) the identification of novel and safe agents promoting
B-cell differentiating (e.g. epigenetic modifiers [33]), (ii)
the development of technologies and strategies allowing
selective targeting of leukemic cells [97] and (iii) the
development of an in vivo animal model.

Patients
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia B-cells were
obtained from the peripheral blood of 11 untreated patients
having been diagnosed in accordance with international
guidelines (Table 1). All patients provided their written,
informed consent to participate in the study. All procedures
involving samples from patients were approved by the
local institutional review board (Comité de Protection des
Personnes Nord-Ouest, Amiens, France).

Immunophenotypic analysis
Cells were stained with the appropriate combi­
nations of fluorochrome-conjugated Abs, in a three- to
five-color direct immunofluorescence staining protocol.
All antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences
(Le Pont de Claix, France). The Cytofix/Cytoperm kit
(BD Biosciences) was used for the intracellular staining
of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Ki67, according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations. Flow cytometry
analysis was performed with a FACSCantoII flow

anti-survivin antibody used in our work does not detect
survivin splicing forms. The results were visualized on a
ChemiDocTM MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad, Marnesla-Coquette, France). Densitometric quantification was
performed with ImageJ analysis software (NIH) (http://
rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/).

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated
by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation of heparinized
venous blood samples from CLL patients. CD19+CD5+
CLL B-cells were purified by negative selection using
magnetic bead-activated cell sorting (MACS), with a
B cell (B-CLL) isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec). The purity
of all preparations was around 98% and the cells coexpressed CD19 and CD5 at their surface (as assessed by
flow cytometry). Direct labeling with anti-CD2, CD14 and
CD56 antibodies was always used to check that purified
CLL B-cells were not contaminated by other immune
cells. On day (D) 0, purified CLL B-cells were seeded
at a concentration of 2 × 106/ml and stimulated for four
days with PMA (1 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Heidelberg, Germany) or with phosphorothioate CpG
oligodeoxynucleotide 2006 (10 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich)
in association with histidine-tagged soluble recombinant
human CD40L (50 ng/ml), anti-polyhistidine monoclonal
antibody (mAb) (5 μg/ml; R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK)
and interleukins (IL)-2 (50 ng/ml), IL-10 (50 ng/ml) and
IL-15 (10 ng/ml). The cells were cultured in 5 ml wells
in six-well, flat-bottomed culture plates. On D4, the cells
were harvested, washed and seeded at a concentration of
106/ml in the presence of IL-2 (50 ng/ml), IL-6 (50 ng/
ml), IL-10 (50 ng/ml), and IL-15 (10 ng/ml) for 3 days. On
D7, cells were harvested, washed and analyzed. All human
recombinant cytokines were purchased from PeproTech
EC (Neuilly-Sur-Seine, France).

Cell viability and cell cycle analysis
Cell viability was measured by flow cytometry using
annexin-V-phycoerythrin (PE) and 7-amino-actinomycin
(7-AAD) staining kit (BD Biosciences) according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. Cell cycle status was
assessed using Vybrant DyeCycle Violet stain (Invitrogen,
Courtaboeuf, France), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, 3 × 105 cells were suspended in
complete medium containing 0.5 μl of Vybrant DyeCycle
Violet stain for 30 minutes at 37°C.
Cells were analyzed with a FACSCanto flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences) and data analysis was
performed by FlowJo software (Tree Star).

Analysis of IgM, IgG and IgA secretion
The levels of human IgM, IgG, and IgA in the culture
supernatants were quantified with the corresponding
ELISA kit (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA).
