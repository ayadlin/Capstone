Abstract

Author Manuscript

Genetic alterations in human cancers and murine models indicate that Rb and p53 have critical
tumor suppressive functions in retinoblastoma, a tumor of neural origin, and neuroendocrine
tumors including small cell lung cancer and medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Rb inactivation is
the initiating lesion in retinoblastoma and current models propose that induction of apoptosis is a
key p53 tumor suppressive function. Genetic studies in mice, however, indicate that other
undefined p53 tumor suppressive functions are operative in vivo. How p53 loss cooperates with
Rb inactivation to promote carcinogenesis is also not fully understood. In the current study,
genetically engineered mice were generated to determine the role of Rb and p53 in MTC
pathogenesis and test the hypothesis that p53 suppresses carcinogenesis by inhibiting mTOR
signaling. Conditional Rb ablation resulted in thyroid tumors mimicking human MTC, and
additional p53 loss led to rapid tumor progression. p53 suppressed tumorigenesis by inhibiting cell
cycle progression, but did not induce apoptosis. On the contrary, p53 loss led to increased
apoptosis that had to be overcome for tumor progression. mTOR activity was markedly increased
in p53 deficient tumors and rapamycin treatment suppressed tumor cell growth identifying mTOR
inhibition as a critical p53 tumor suppressive function. Rapamycin treatment did not result in
AKT/MAPK activation providing evidence that this feedback mechanism operative in other
cancers is not a general response to mTORC1 inhibition. Together, these studies provide
mechanistic links between genetic alterations and aberrant signaling pathways critical in
carcinogenesis, and identify essential Rb and p53 tumor suppressive functions in vivo.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

The tumor suppressive pathways centered on p53 and the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein are
deregulated in the vast majority of human cancers providing strong evidence that Rb and
p53 cooperate to suppress carcinogenesis. p53 mutations are the most common genetic event
in human cancer but the critical p53 tumor suppressive functions operative in vivo are still
not entirely defined (1). Additionally, how p53 loss cooperates with Rb inactivation to
promote carcinogenesis is not fully understood. Activation of p53 occurs in response to a
wide variety of stress signals and drives several potential cellular outcomes including cell
cycle arrest, senescence, differentiation and apoptosis (2, 3). Current models propose that
apoptosis is a key mechanism by which p53 eliminates cancer cells. Challenging this notion
is the observation that mice expressing p53 mutant proteins deficient in driving apoptosis are
protected from tumor development, indicating that p53 has other in vivo functions critical
for suppressing tumorigenesis (4). Studies in cultured cells demonstrate that p53 is capable
of inhibiting mTOR signaling to shut down growth of cells under stress, thus identifying
mTOR inhibition as a potential novel mechanism by which p53 suppresses cancer (5, 6).

Genetic alterations in human cancers and murine models indicate that Rb and p53 have
critical roles in suppressing retinoblastoma, a tumor of neural origin, and the neuroendocrine
tumors small cell lung cancers (SCLC) and medullary thyroid cancers (MTC). Rb
inactivation is the initiating genetic lesion in human retinoblastoma and p53 suppresses
retinoblastoma development in mice (7, 8). Although the p53 gene is intact in human
retinoblastomas, molecular studies reveal that the p53 tumor surveillance pathway is
activated in human retinogenesis after Rb loss leading to apoptosis and cell cycle exit (7, 8).
This p53 dependent response is suppressed during retinoblastoma progression by several
mechanisms including CDKN2A gene deletions and increased MDM2 or MDMX
expression. Strong evidence supporting cooperative roles for Rb and p53 in suppressing
SCLC also exists in both mice and humans. Rb and p53 gene mutations are detected in
>80% of human SCLC providing evidence that loss of these tumor suppressors is critical, if
not essential, for SCLC development (9). Moreover, persons with Rb germline mutations
have a 15 fold increased risk for developing SCLC. In mice, combined Rb and p53 loss
targeted to the lung epithelium results in metastatic SCLC (10). Finally, genetic Rb ablation
in multiple murine models results in MTC. It remains unclear, however, if p53 cooperates
with Rb to suppress MTC pathogenesis (11-13). p53 loss was reported to cooperate with Rb
loss in MTC development based upon increased MTC incidence in combined germline
Rb+/−/p53+/− as compared to Rb+/− mice (11). In contrast, Williams, et al. reported no
additional effect of germline p53 loss on MTC development in Rb+/− mice (13). Genetic
backgrounds were similar in the two studies and therefore strain does not account for the
differing results.
MTC are aggressive radiation and chemotherapy resistant neuroendocrine tumors (14-17).
Surgery offers the only curative approach and no effective therapy exists for distant
metastatic disease. The observed poor outcomes in this disease are thus largely due to
frequent presentation with metastatic disease and persistent or relapsing disease after surgery
(15, 16). The tyrosine kinase inhibitor, vandetanib, was recently shown to prolong

progression free survival in progressive MTC (18). Despite this advancement, no treatment
has been shown to improve overall survival, stressing the need for novel therapies. The
discovery of vandetanib as an effective targeted therapy provides proof of principle that
defining molecular mechanisms driving MTC pathogenesis holds promise for developing
effective treatments. Determining cause-effect relationships between genetic alterations and
aberrant molecular signaling also hold promise for developing biomarkers and patient
stratification algorithms to optimize therapy response.

Germline oncogenic RET mutations occur in nearly all patients with hereditary MTC;
however, tumors in these patients are monoclonal suggesting that additional somatic
alterations are required to promote tumorigenesis (14). In support of this notion, expression
of the frequently detected RET M918T mutation in murine models leads to C-cell
hyperplasia but not MTC indicating that RET deregulation is not sufficient for MTC
development (19). The secondary events and the genetic alterations promoting sporadic
MTC that comprise ~75% of cases remain unknown. The incidence of RET mutations in
sporadic MTC varies greatly among reported series leaving the pathogenesis of up to two
thirds of cases unclear (14-18, 20). Studies exploring other molecules in the RET signaling
cascade have likewise yielded varying mutation rates further highlighting the need to
identify causative genetic events in MTC (14, 20-22). Despite the knowledge void in MTC
genetics, it is of clinical significance that mTOR signaling is functionally activated in
50-100% of cases (21, 23, 24). Oncogenic RET can induce mTOR activation explaining the
positive correlation between RET mutations and mTOR activation in hereditary MTC.
mTOR activation however is also detected in sporadic MTC lacking RET mutations
indicating alternate, as yet undefined, mechanisms to induce mTOR signaling. In the current
study, mouse models were used to demonstrate that Rb and p53 have distinct and
cooperative roles in MTC pathogenesis. Mechanistic studies reveal that p53 suppresses
MTC progression by inhibiting cell cycle progression and mTOR activation. Surprisingly,
p53 loss resulted in increased apoptosis that needed to be overcome for tumor progression.
Pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 signaling decreased MTC cell growth in the
absence of feedback AKT or MAPK activation shown to limit rapamycin effectiveness in
other cancers (25) providing rationale for exploring mTOR pathway inhibition as a
therapeutic strategy for MTC.

RESULTS

Rb ablation targeted to the thyroid results in a uniformly penetrant model of human MTC

Author Manuscript

A genetically engineered mouse model was developed to target Cre recombinase mediated
Rb gene ablation under control of the surfactant protein C (SPC) promoted reverse
tetracycline transactivator (Fig. 1a; (26)). Treatment with doxycycline throughout gestation
resulted in Rb ablation throughout the lung epithelium as well as in a subset of thymic and
thyroid cells, consistent with previous reports (27). Double transgenic mice homozygous for
floxed Rb alleles (designated Rb ablated) developed pulmonary neuroendocrine hyperplasia
as previously described and uniformly developed thyroid tumors (Fig. 1b, n=29) (26). No
thyroid tumors were detected in littermate controls lacking the Cre transgene (designated
control; n=11) indicating that Rb loss was required for thyroid tumor initiation. Epithelial

cell hyperplasia and/or microscopic nodules were detected in all Rb ablated thyroids
analyzed at 4 months of age (n=10) with subsequent growth resulting in tumors with an
average maximum dimension of 6.0 mm by 7-10 months of age (n=22; Fig. 2e). The thyroid
tumors were phenotypically indistinguishable from human MTC being comprised of
malignant cells with fine to moderately coarse nuclear chromatin; a characteristic and
diagnostic feature of neuroendocrine tumors (Fig. 1b). The tumors expressed calcitonin
similar to that seen in human MTC (Fig. 1b). Rb gene recombination was confirmed
demonstrating that the tumors arose from Rb deficient cells (Fig. 1c). These studies
demonstrate that Rb loss is sufficient to induce thyroid tumors that phenotypically mimic
human MTC. Moreover, the thyroid phenotype is fully penetrant by four months of age
making this a valuable model to study Rb mediated tumorigenesis.
p53 loss promotes Rb deficient tumor progression

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Activated p53 was detected in Rb deficient thyroid tumors leading to the hypothesis that the
oncogenic stimulus induced by Rb loss leads to a p53 response that suppresses carcinoma
progression (Figs. 1d and 2c). To directly test this hypothesis, p53 was conditionally ablated
in Rb deficient thyroids by generating double transgenic mice with floxed Rb and p53
alleles (designated Rb/p53 ablated). Tumors were detected in 15/16 (93%) Rb/p53 ablated
thyroids but not in littermate controls lacking the Cre transgene (n=13). The mice also
developed pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinomas (data not shown). p53 ablation in Rb
deficient thyroid tumors resulted in dramatic MTC progression and a median survival of 4
months (Fig. 2a, c). The tumor promoting effect of p53 loss was evident by 9 weeks of age
(Fig. 2d) with the effect being even more dramatic at 4 months when Rb/p53 deficient
thyroids were five times larger than Rb deficient thyroids (Fig. 2e). Rb/p53 ablated tumors
were comprised of cells with recombined Rb and p53 alleles, and were phenotypically
similar to Rb deficient MTC including staining positive for calcitonin and no identifiable
histopathologic evidence of differences in tumor grade (Fig. 2b-c). These data directly
demonstrate that although p53 loss is not sufficient to initiate neuroendocrine tumorigenesis,
p53 plays a critical role in suppressing Rb deficient cancer progression.
p53 loss enhances Rb deficient tumor progression by promoting cell growth despite
increased cell death

Author Manuscript

Cell proliferation and death were compared between Rb and Rb/p53 ablated thyroid tumors
to determine mechanisms accounting for the dramatic p53 dependent suppression of MTC
progression. p53 loss resulted in a significant increase in cell cycle progression (Fig 3a).
Notably, p53 loss did not promote cell survival but rather led to increased apoptotic cell
death as indicated by a significant increase in cleaved caspase-3 positive tumor cells in
Rb/p53 as compared to Rb ablated tumors (Fig. 3b). Additionally, cleaved PARP levels
were higher in combined Rb/p53 deficient tumors as compared to Rb loss alone (Fig. 3c).
These data identify enhanced cellular proliferation as an underlying mechanism promoting
MTC progression after p53 loss. Moreover, the data directly demonstrate that the established
apoptotic function of p53 is not responsible for p53 mediated suppression of MTC
progression. In contrast, increased cell death resulting from p53 loss must be overcome to
result in the dramatic p53 dependent tumor progression seen in Rb deficient tumors.

p53 loss results in mTOR pathway activation

Author Manuscript

p53 mediated suppression of the IGF-1/AKT/mTOR pathway was recently identified as a
novel mechanism to negatively regulate cell growth in culture (5, 6). To determine whether
p53 suppressed this growth stimulatory pathway in vivo, expression of activated signaling
molecules was determined in Rb and Rb/p53 ablated thyroid tumors. p53 loss resulted in
marked mTOR pathway activation as indicated by increased expression of the downstream
mTORC1 target, phosphorylated S6 kinase (p-S6K) (Fig. 4a). In contrast, phosphorylated
AKT (p-AKT) levels were similar in Rb and Rb/p53 ablated tumors and p53 loss resulted in
decreased phosphorylated MEK (p-MEK) levels (Fig. 4b-c). These data demonstrate that
p53 loss results in mTOR pathway activation during tumor progression in vivo in the
absence of increased AKT signaling and coincident with downregulated MAPK signaling.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

p53 transcriptionally induces multiple genes that repress IGF-1/AKT/mTOR pathway
signaling (Fig. 4d) (5, 28). Examination of these p53 targets in Rb and Rb/p53 deficient
MTC revealed that p53 loss was associated with decreased expression of the mTOR
pathway inhibitors, sestrin 2 (Sesn2), tuberous sclerosis 2 (Tsc2), polo-like kinase 2 (Plk2),
insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (Igfbp3) and phosphatase and tensin homolog
(Pten) (Fig. 4d). In contrast, the p53 target genes DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4
(Ddit4) and protein kinase AMP-activated, beta 1 non-catalytic subunit (Prkab1) were not
significantly changed in Rb/p53 as compared to Rb ablated tumors demonstrating that p53
loss led to selective downregulation of a subset of p53 target genes. mTOR activation in
Rb/p53 deficient MTC was present in the absence of AKT activation indicating that
physiologically relevant p53 targets critical for suppressing MTC progression are likely
downstream of AKT. Sestrin 2, TSC2 and PLK2 inhibit mTOR signaling downstream of
AKT identifying these molecules as potential mediators of p53 dependent tumor suppression
in vivo. These data provide evidence that p53 positively regulates mTOR pathway inhibitors
in vivo, and directly demonstrate that p53 suppresses mTOR pathway signaling in the
context of tumor progression.
p53 loss is required for establishing Rb deficient MTC cells in culture and p53 expression
in Rb/p53 deficient MTC cells suppresses cell growth and mTOR pathway activity

Author Manuscript

Rb and Rb/p53 ablated thyroid tumors were explanted to propagate tumor cells in culture
(Supplemental Table and Fig. S1). MTC cell cultures were efficiently established from
Rb/p53 ablated explanted tumors after 1.5-2.3 months in culture. Rb and p53 gene
recombination was detected in all cell cultures demonstrating that the cultured cells were
derived from MTC (Fig. S1). In contrast to Rb/p53 ablated tumors, only one of 13 Rb
ablated explanted tumors resulted in an established MTC cell culture and this occurred after
an extended culture period of 9.4 months. Cells grew from four additional Rb ablated tumors
after 8-11 months in culture but no or partial Rb gene recombination was detected in the
resultant cells despite uniform Rb recombination in the original explanted tumors indicating
that the cultures were not pure MTC tumor cells (Supplemental Table and Fig. S1).
Interestingly, cells established from the one Rb ablated tumor had p53 allelic loss (Fig. S2).
These data provide evidence that p53 loss is required for establishing Rb deficient MTC cell
cultures and support the in vivo results showing that p53 loss in Rb deficient tumors results
in a more aggressive phenotype.

Rb and p53 are established regulators of cellular differentiation, and differentiation control
was identified as a key p53 family tumor suppressor activity (2). Thus, the effects of Rb and
combined Rb/p53 loss on MTC differentiation were assessed in thyroid tumors and cultured
cells. High calcitonin and synaptophysin expression was detected in Rb deficient tumors
(Fig. S1). Additional loss of p53 was associated with a significant decrease in calcitonin
expression but no change in expression of the more general neuroendocrine marker,
synaptophysin. Minimal or no calcitonin and synaptophysin expression was detected in
combined Rb/p53 deficient MTC cultured cells. These data indicate that MTC propagation
in culture and p53 loss is associated with decreased cellular differentiation.

Author Manuscript

Expression of p53 in three independently derived Rb/p53 deficient MTC cell cultures from
tumors that developed in three different mice inhibited cell growth (Fig. 5a). Moreover, p53
expression suppressed mTOR pathway activation and resulted in increased expression of
mTOR pathway inhibitors, including Sesn2, Plk2 and Pten identified as candidate mediators
linking p53 and mTOR in vivo (Figs. 5b-c and 4d). These data provide further evidence that
p53 suppression of mTOR signaling is critical for inhibiting tumor cell growth.
mTOR pathway inhibition by rapamycin suppresses Rb/p53 deficient tumor cell growth

Author Manuscript

Rapamycin treatment of MTC cells resulted in dramatic inhibition of p-S6K and inhibited
cell growth in a dose-dependent manner in all three independently derived Rb/p53 deficient
MTC cell cultures (Fig. 6a-b). Time course experiments demonstrated statistically
significant decreases in cell growth by 48 and 72 hours after rapamycin treatment in all three
cell cultures by both cell counts and WST-1 assays (Fig. 6c and data not shown). No
evidence of rapamycin induced apoptosis was detected by cleaved-PARP expression (Fig.
6d). These studies demonstrate that mTOR pathway activation resulting from p53 loss
functions to stimulate tumor cell growth. Moreover, rapamycin is effective in suppressing
p53 dependent mTOR pathway activation resulting in decreased tumor cell growth.
mTOR pathway inhibition in MTC tumor cells does not induce MAPK or AKT pathway
activation

Author Manuscript

mTORC1 inhibition was previously shown to induce MAPK pathway activation leading to
the conclusion that tumor cells evade a therapeutic response to rapamycin by upregulating
AKT and MAPK signaling (25). To determine whether feedback induction of kinase
pathway signaling is tumor type specific or represents a general response, rapamycin treated
MTC cells were assessed for MAPK and AKT pathway activation. In contrast to prior
reports, MAPK activation was not detected in MTC cells as assessed by p-ERK levels (Fig.
7). In fact, rapamycin treatment resulted in a significant decrease in MAPK signaling in all
three cell cultures. AKT pathway signaling was more variable with one culture showing a
significant decrease in p-AKT levels and the other two cultures showing no significant
change (Fig. 7). Importantly, however, AKT activation was not increased after rapamycin
treatment in any of the three independently derived cell cultures. Thus, rapamycin treatment
of MTC tumor cells is not associated with MAPK or AKT pathway activation. Instead,
inhibition of mTORC1 pathway signaling led to MAPK downregulation. These data indicate
that MAPK pathway activation after mTORC1 inhibition is tumor cell type specific and
does not represent a general tumor response.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Rb and p53 have distinct and cooperative evolutionarily conserved roles in suppressing
carcinogenesis in mice and humans. The critical role for Rb in neuroendocrine cell function
and tumorigenesis is striking. A major defect in germline Rb-/- mice is ectopic cell
proliferation and death in neural tissues. In addition, Rb+/− and conditional Rb ablated mice
develop a remarkable spectrum of neuroendocrine tumors in multiple organs (11-13). The
neuroendocrine tumor spectrum is extended to additional organs with combined Rb/p53 loss
(11, 13). The current studies extend these reports by demonstrating that Rb loss induces a
p53 dependent response critical for suppressing tumor progression. Rb ablation resulted in
consistent MTC development with uniform latency providing evidence that Rb loss is
sufficient for tumor initiation. In contrast, p53 loss is not sufficient for tumor initiation ((13)
and data not shown) but data herein directly demonstrate that p53 plays a critical and
prominent role in suppressing tumor progression by inhibiting cell cycle progression and
suppressing mTORC1 activity. The critical and selective role for Rb and p53 in suppressing
neuroendocrine carcinogenesis is further demonstrated in the lung epithelium which is
comprised of neuroendocrine as well as multiple non-neuroendocrine cell types. Rb loss is
sufficient to selectively induce neuroendocrine hyperplasia and additional loss of p53 results
in highly aggressive SCLC (10, 26, 29). These findings in mice recapitulate the genetics in
human disease. Together, these data provide robust evidence that Rb and p53 play critical
evolutionally conserved roles in suppressing neuroendocrine carcinogenesis.

The data presented herein directly demonstrate that Rb and p53 cooperate to suppress the
aggressive neuroendocrine thyroid carcinoma, MTC. The prevalence of Rb and p53
alterations in human MTC is unclear. The Rb gene has not been directly assessed in MTC;
however comparative genomic hybridization detected losses of chromosome 13q wherein
the Rb gene resides (30-32). Immunohistochemical analyses resulted in varying results.
Holm, et al. detected Rb expression in 46 MTC whereas more recent smaller case series
reported loss of Rb staining in 20-50% of cases (33-35). Genetic assessment of the p53 gene
in MTC resulted in no detected mutations in earlier reports (36-38), whereas more recent
studies report p53 mutations and deletions in up to 44% of cases (39, 40). Given the
differing published results, a systematic analysis of Rb and p53 status in MTC is necessary
to clarify their role in human MTC. Regardless of the genetic alteration, however, the
mTOR pathway is functionally activated in the vast majority of cases (21, 23, 24). mTOR
pathway activation drives cancer growth by activating lipid and protein biosynthesis needed
for robust tumor expansion (41). mTOR is a serine/threonine protein kinase that functions in
two distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, that regulate discrete sets of cellular
responses. Protein synthesis is the best characterized process controlled by mTORC1 (42).
Phosphorylated S6, a primary mTORC1 effector, was detected in 49/51 (96%) of human
MTC (24). Some of the pS6 positive tumors did not express p-AKT and did not have RET
mutations indicating that mTOR activation was induced by other mechanisms (21, 24). The
current studies identify p53 loss as an alternate mechanism to activate mTOR signaling in
vivo. Moreover, the data demonstrate that p53 loss and mTOR activation are associated with
dramatic tumor progression. Interesting, pS6 was upregulated in 22/23 (96%) lymph node

metastases as compared with autologous matched primary MTC supporting a similar role for
mTOR activation in human MTC progression (24).
p53 suppresses tumor progression by inhibiting cellular proliferation and mTOR pathway
signaling. Mechanistic studies underlying p53 dependent phenotypes in the current studies
reveal that p53 suppresses MTC progression by inhibiting cell cycle progression. Similarly,
p53 loss results in increased proliferation in murine models of retinoblastoma and activation
of the p53 tumor surveillance pathway in human retinogenesis after Rb loss leads to cell
cycle exit (7, 8). Surprisingly, p53 induction did not induce an apoptotic response in the
current studies but rather p53 loss was associated with increased apoptosis. This finding is in
contrast to the lack of effect of p53 loss on apoptosis in murine retinoblastoma and the
promotion of apoptosis induced by activation of the p53 tumor surveillance pathway in
human retinogenesis (7, 8).

The discovery that p53 loss promotes tumor cell growth by enhancing mTOR pathway
signaling has therapeutic implications. Reactivation of wild type p53 in p53 null or mutant
tumors is sufficient to induce tumor stasis or regression: however, targeting p53
therapeutically has been challenging and has not yet impacted patient care (43). An alternate
approach is to identify mechanisms by which p53 loss promotes tumor growth and target
these downstream pathways. The mTOR pathway represents one such downstream pathway.
The current studies demonstrate that targeting mTORC1 in p53 deficient MTC suppresses
tumor cell growth. Similarly, inhibition of mTOR signaling in human MTC cell lines
suppresses proliferation, motility and tumorigenicity (21, 24, 44, 45). Moreover, tumor
responses were seen in two patients with progressive metastatic MTC treated with the
mTOR inhibitor, everolimus (44). Tumor cell growth was suppressed by cell cycle
inhibition in the absence of apoptosis consistent with mTORC1 inhibitors being primarily
cytostatic, rather than cytotoxic, and thus inducing disease stabilization as opposed to
regression (24, 41, 44, 45). Clinical successes resulting from mTORC1 targeting drugs
include substantial benefit in treatment of renal cell carcinoma, mantle cell lymphoma,
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and benign tumors arising from TSC1 and TSC2
mutations (41, 46). In other instances, rapalogs have shown only modest efficacy in tumors
wherein benefits were expected based upon insights into mTOR pathway signaling. The
effectiveness of rapamycin treatment was shown to be impaired by the unintended activation
of feedback loops that drive mitogenic signaling through AKT, RAS/MAPK and mTORC2
activation (41, 42). This discovery provided rationale for ongoing clinical trials combining
mTOR, PI3K, AKT and MEK inhibitors (47). Interestingly, mTORC1 inhibition by
rapamycin in the current studies did not result in feedback activation of AKT or MAPK
signaling. These results highlight the need to carefully consider tumor specific crosstalk
interactions in the mTOR pathway in order to design the most effective combination
therapies while avoiding unnecessary toxicities.
In summary, the current studies demonstrate that Rb and p53 have distinct roles in
suppressing MTC. Conditional Rb, but not p53, loss in the thyroid is sufficient for tumor
initiation with a long latency, whereas combined Rb and p53 ablation results in highly
penetrant MTC with consistent, rapid tumor progression. The oncogenic stimulus provided
by Rb loss leads to a p53 tumor suppressive response that inhibits cellular proliferation and

mTOR dependent cell growth. Inhibition of mTORC1 signaling suppressed tumor cell
growth demonstrating that mTOR pathway inhibition is a critical p53 tumor suppressive
function. Notably, rapamycin induced mTORC1 inhibition did not result in MAPK or AKT
pathway activation as was seen in other carcinomas providing evidence that this feedback
mechanism is tumor type specific and not a general response to blocking mTORC1
signaling. Together, these studies provide mechanistic links between genetic alterations and
aberrant signaling pathways critical in Rb and p53 dependent cancer initiation and
progression in vivo. The established role for Rb and p53 pathways in suppressing
neuroendocrine carcinomas coupled with the growth inhibitory response of drugs targeting
mTOR signaling in human pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors support common regulatory
mechanisms operative in mice and humans (46). Thus, in addition to providing mechanistic
insights, the generated mouse models provide robust preclinical platforms to explore novel
therapeutic strategies as well as define mechanisms underlying treatment response and
resistance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mouse strains and genotyping
Surfactant protein C (SPC)-rtTA; tet-Cre mice with floxed Rb or Rb and p53 (FVB;129Trp53tm1Brn obtained from NCI Mouse Repository) alleles were treated with doxycycline
throughout gestation (26, 48). Genotypes were determined by PCR analysis of tail DNA
using previously established primers (NCI Mouse Repository and (26)).
Establishment of MTC cell cultures and culture conditions

Author Manuscript

Thyroid tumors were minced and cultured in HITES medium supplemented with 2% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin (49). All explanted tumors were
morphologically confirmed as MTC. NIH3T3 cells were obtained from ATCC and
maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium supplemented with 10% FBS and
penicillin/streptomycin.
PCR analysis for Rb and p53 gene recombination
Genomic DNA was subjected to 30 PCR cycles (30 sec at 94 °C, 30 sec at 58 °C, and 30 sec
at 72 °C) using the Rb primers Rb212, Rb18 and Rb19E (29) and p53 primers p53-T008 (5’CACAAAAACAGGTTAAACCCA-3’) and p53-T011 (5’-GAAGACAGAAAAGGG-3’).
Histology and immunohistochemistry

Author Manuscript

Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin, paraffin embedded and analyzed on hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E) stained sections. Immunohistochemistry was performed using Vectastain Elite
ABC and DAB Substrate kits (Vector Laboratories). Methanol/hydrogen peroxide
pretreatment, microwave 10 mmol/L citrate antigen retrieval, and serum blocking was
performed. Antibodies were incubated at 4°C overnight: Calcitonin (1:8000; Bachem), p53
(1:500; (CM5) Leica Microsystems), phosphorylated histone H3 (1:1000; US Biological)
and cleaved caspase-3 (Asp 175) (1:150, Cell Signaling). Slides were counterstained with
nuclear fast red. Cell proliferation and apoptosis was quantified by determining percentage
positive cells with 303-534 cells analyzed per group.

Adenovirus infection, rapamycin treatment and cell growth assays

Author Manuscript

Cells were seeded into 96-well plates and were infected after media change the following
day with Ad-p53-GFP or control Ad-GFP adenoviruses generously provided by Susanne I.
Wells (50) Infection efficiency for p53 and control virus were similar as determined by GFP
positive cells, ranging between 13-39% for the three MTC cell cultures. Cell growth was
determined by WST-1 assays (Millipore). For rapamycin treatments, cells were seeded in
12-well plates at 1×105 cells/well for cell counting or 96-well plates at 5×103 cells/well for
WST-1 assays and treated the following day with 1, 10, 20 and 50nM rapamycin for 72
hours or 20 nM rapamycin for 24, 48 and 72 hours. Cells treated with DMSO vehicle served
as controls. Cell growth was determined by hemocytometer cell counts and WST-1 assays.
Data is representative of triplicate or sextuplicate samples and two or three independent
experiments.

Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

GraphPad Prism (ver. 5.0d) was used for all statistical analyses. Symptom free survival was
analyzed by the Kaplan Meier log-rank test. One-way Anova followed by Tukey’s multiple
comparison was used to analyze thyroid/body weight and thyroid tumor size, and
Bonferroni’s multiple comparison to analyze calcitonin and synaptophysin expression. p53
target gene expression and protein expression was analyzed using unpaired Student's t-tests
assuming equal or unequal variance. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.

Figure 1. Conditional Rb ablation in the thyroid results in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC)

Author Manuscript

(a) Rb ablation was targeted to the lung and a subset of thyroid cells by generating mice
containing 1) the reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) under control of the human
surfactant protein C (SPC) promoter, 2) Cre recombinase under control of the tet operator
and minimal CMV promoter, and 3) floxed (LoxP) Rb alleles. Doxycycline treatment
(circles) activates rtTA (arches) which induces Cre recombinase expression resulting in
floxed Rb gene recombination. (b) Mice with conditional Rb ablation developed thyroid
tumors (T) that mimic human MTC by morphology (H&E staining) and calcitonin
expression as assessed by immunohistochemistry. An arrow indicates normal thyroid tissue
surrounding the tumor. Representative images from 8-9 month old Rb ablated mice. (c) Rb
recombination (RbRec) was detected in MTC derived DNA by PCR analysis. Floxed
(RbLoxP), RbRec and wild type Rb (RbWt) bands are indicated. C and Ø represent positive
and negative no DNA controls, respectively. (d) Activated, phosphorylated p53 and total
p53 protein were detected in Rb ablated tumors by Western blot analysis. Blots were
reprobed for actin as a loading control.

(a) p53 loss was associated with a marked reduction in symptom free survival of Rb ablated
mice as indicated by curves showing the percentage of Rb ablated and Rb/p53 ablated mice
that had MTC at the time of death, when moribund, or after losing ≥ 10% body weight.
Median survival for Rb and Rb/p53 ablated mice was 9.6 and 4.1 months, respectively. (b)
Rb (RbRec) and p53 (p53Rec) recombination was detected in MTC derived DNA by PCR
analysis. RbLoxP, RbRec. RbWt and p53Rec bands are indicated. C and Ø represent positive
and negative no DNA controls, respectively. (c) Mice with combined Rb/p53 ablated
thyroids developed tumors similar to that seen after Rb ablation alone. The thyroid tumors
mimicked human MTC by morphology (H&E stained low and high power images are
shown) and calcitonin expression as assessed by immunohistochemistry. p53 was detected
by immunohistochemistry in all Rb ablated tumors tested (n=3 and 16 at 4 and 7-9 months,
respectively) with variable numbers of p53 positive cells in individual tumors. No p53 was
detected in Rb/p53 ablated tumors (n=5). Arrows indicate tumors. (d) Thyroid to body
weight ratios in 9 week old mice were significantly increased after combined Rb/p53
ablation as compared to Rb ablation alone and Rb/p53 proficient controls. (e) Rb/p53
ablated tumors were significantly larger than Rb ablated tumors in mice at 4 months and
7-10 months of age. Data are represented as mean ± SD. ***p<0.001.

Figure 3. p53 loss stimulates MTC cell proliferation and apoptosis

Author Manuscript

(a) Cell proliferation was determined by percentage of tumor cells positive for the mitotic
marker, phosphorylated histone H3 (p-HH3) by immunohistochemistry. The percentage of
p-HH3 positive cells was significantly increased in Rb/p53 as compared to Rb ablated
tumors. Apoptotic cell death was assessed by immunohistchemistry for cleaved caspase-3
(CC3) (b) and Western blot analysis for cleaved PARP (c). Both CC3 positive cells and
cleaved PARP were significantly increased in Rb/p53 compared to Rb ablated tumors.
Western blots were reprobed for actin as a loading control. Quantification of cleaved PARP
is represented as relative densitometric values of cleaved PARP normalized to actin. Data
are represented as mean ± SD. *p<0.05, **p<0.01 and ***p<0.001.

Figure 4. p53 loss results in mTOR pathway activation in Rb deficient MTC

Author Manuscript

Activated, phosphorylated forms of S6 kinase (p-S6K), AKT (p-AKT) and MEK (pMEK1/2) as well as corresponding total protein levels (S6K, AKT and MEK-1) were
compared between Rb and Rb/p53 ablated thyroid tumors by Western blot analysis. (a) pS6K was significantly increased in Rb/p53 as compared to Rb ablated tumors despite similar
total S6K levels. (b) p-AKT and total AKT levels were similar in Rb and Rb/p53 ablated
tumors. (c) p-MEK was significantly decreased in Rb/p53 as compared to Rb ablated tumors
despite similar total MEK levels. Quantification is represented as relative densitometric
values of phosphorylated:total protein ratios. (d) p53 loss in Rb deficient MTC results in
decreased expression of mTOR pathway inhibitors. Schematic diagram illustrating
previously identified p53 target genes (blue outlined boxes) known to repress mTOR
signaling. Activation is indicated in blue and suppression in red. Quantitative RT-PCR
showed significantly reduced expression of Sesn2, Tsc2, Plk2, Igfbp3 and Pten (blue shaded

p53 expression inhibits cell growth and decreases mTOR pathway activity in Rb/p53
deficient MTC cells
(a) Cell growth was significantly decreased by 24 hours and sustained to 72 hours after
infection with p53 adenovirus (Ad-p53) as compared to control virus in three independently
derived MTC cell cultures (#1, #2, #3) derived from three different mice as assessed by
WST-1 assays. Results are representative of two independent experiments. Data are
represented as mean ± SD (n=4 wells/group). (b) Expression of activated p53
phosphorylated at serine 15 (p-p53) and total p53 (p53) protein was associated with
decreased p-S6K protein levels as compared to cells infected with control adenovirus (C) 24
hours after infection of cell culture #2. No change was detected in total S6K levels. Blots
were reprobed for actin or GAPDH as loading controls. Results are representative of two
independent experiments. (c) p53 expression in Rb/p53 deficient MTC cells resulted in
increased expression of mTOR pathway inhibitors. Quantitative RT-PCR showed
significantly increased expression of Sesn2, Plk2, Pten and Ddit4, no change in Tsc2 and
Prkab1 expression, and decreased expression of Igfbp3 in p53 expressing MTC culture #2
cells as compared to cells infected with control virus (C). Data are represented as mean ± SD
(n=3 wells/group). *p<0.05, **p<0.01 and ***p<0.001.

Figure 6. mTOR pathway inhibition by rapamycin suppresses Rb/p53 deficient MTC cell growth

The effect of rapamycin on Rb/p53 deficient MTC cell growth was assessed in three
independently derived MTC cell cultures (#1, #2 and #3) generated from three different
mice. (a) Western blot analysis for S6K phosphorylation demonstrated dramatic mTOR
signaling inhibition by 0.5 hours (h) after 20 nM rapamycin treatment that was sustained at
24 hours in all three cell cultures. Total S6K levels were similar at all time points. Blots
were reprobed for actin as a loading control. Results are representative of three independent
experiments. (b) MTC cell cultures were inhibited by rapamycin in a dose dependent
manner as assessed by WST-1 assays performed after 72 hours of rapamycin treatment.
Results are representative of three independent experiments. Data are represented as mean ±
SD (n=6 wells/group). (c) MTC cell growth was significantly decreased by 48 hours after
treatment with 20 nM rapamycin (20 nM) as compared to vehicle controls (0 nM) in all
three cell cultures as assessed by cell counts in time-course experiments. Results are
representative of two independent experiments. Data are represented as mean ± SD (n=3
wells/group). (d) Cleaved PARP levels were similar in cultured MTC cells treated for 24
hours with 20 nM rapamycin and vehicle controls by Western blot analysis. Results are
representative of three independent experiments. Quantification of cleaved PARP is
represented as relative densitometric values of cleaved PARP normalized to actin. Data are
represented as mean ± SD. *p<0.05, **p<0.01 and ***p<0.001.

to MAPK or AKT pathway activation

p-AKT was decreased or unchanged in three independently derived MTC cell cultures
treated with 20 nM rapamycin (20 nM) for 24 hours compared to vehicle controls (0 nM) as
assessed by Western blot analysis. p-ERK1/2 levels were significantly decreased in all three
cell cultures. Total AKT (AKT) and ERK (ERK1/2) levels were similar in rapamycin treated
and controls. Western blots were reprobed with tubulin as a loading control. Quantification
is represented as relative densitometric values of phosphorylated:total protein ratios. Results
are representative of three independent experiments. Data are represented as mean ± SD.
