Abstract
Estrogen signaling is critical in the progression of tumors that
bear estrogen receptors. In most patients with breast cancer,
inhibitors that block interactions of estrogen with its
receptors or suppress the production of endogenous estrogens
are important interventions in the clinic. Recent evidence now
suggests that estrogen also contributes to the pathogenesis of
non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We used a human lung
cancer xenograph model system to analyze the effect of
aromatase or estradiol on tumor growth. We further examined
the level of protein expression of aromatase in 422 patients
with NSCLC using a high-density tissue microarray. Results
were confirmed and validated on an independent patient
cohort (n = 337). Lower levels of aromatase predicted a
greater chance of survival in women 65 years and older.
Within this population, the prognostic value of aromatase was
greatest in earlier stage lung cancer (stage I/II). In addition,
for women with no history of smoking, lower aromatase levels
were a strong predictor of survival. Our findings implicate
aromatase as an early-stage predictor of survival in some
women with NSCLC. We predict that women whose lung
cancers have higher levels of aromatase might be good
candidates for targeted treatment with aromatase inhibitors.

Introduction

Materials and Methods

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths
for both men and women (1). In the United States alone, an
estimated 213,380 new cases of lung cancer will be diagnosed in
2007 and f160,390 individuals will die due to this disease (1). Very
little is understood about the underlying mechanisms of development and progression of these neoplasms. Moreover, the search for
effective therapeutic modalities continues to be elusive. Interestingly, the incidence of lung cancer in men has somewhat declined
over the last decade whereas the reported cases in women has
steadily increased. A primary factor for this is the increased level of
smoking by women; however, this does not seem to be the only
determinant as nonsmokers who develop lung cancer are
predominantly women. Recent evidence suggests that estrogen
may play a role in normal lung function as well as in the

development of lung cancer (2–11). Estrogen receptors (ER) a and
h are expressed in normal lung and many non–small cell lung
cancers (NSCLC). In both in vitro and in vivo models, 17h-estradiol
is mitogenic for NSCLC cells and stimulates gene transcription
(2, 3, 5). These effects are inhibited by the ER antagonist, Faslodex
( fulvestrant), as is tumor formation in a human NSCLC xenograph
model in vivo (2).
A key enzyme in estrogen biosynthesis is aromatase (CYP19;
ref. 12–14). Aromatase, a member of the cytochrome P450 family,
converts the androgens androstenedione and testosterone to
estrone and estradiol, respectively. In addition to its expression in
the ovary and placenta, aromatase is present in male and female
extragonadal tissues including breast, lung, brain, and liver (15).
Aromatase expression is elevated in certain malignancies, such as
breast and endometrial carcinomas, prompting the theory that
the tumor-promoting properties caused by the stimulation of ER
pathways could be enhanced by circulating estrogen as well as by
localized autocrine or paracrine production of the steroid hormone.
This rationale led to several clinical studies that confirmed the antitumor efficacy of aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer (13, 16–18).
Here, we examined on a population basis whether changes in the
expression levels of aromatase were diagnostic for NSCLC and/or
predictive of disease outcome. We observed that relatively high
aromatase levels correlated with a worse prognosis of disease
outcome, especially in women >65 years with early-stage NSCLC.

Tumor xenograph studies. The protocol used for implantation of human
lung tumor xenografts in nude mice was described previously (6, 19). Fifteen
6-week-old ovariectomized athymic female mice were injected s.c. with A549
cells (2  108 cells/mouse) and subsequently treated with daily s.c. injections
with androstenedione, estradiol, or buffer control ( five mice per group) as
previously described (6, 19).
Aromatase activity. NSCLC specimens were procured under an
Institutional Review Board–approved protocol from seven males and five
females. Half of each specimen was snap-frozen at 70jC and half was
formalin-fixed, processed, and embedded in paraffin. Aromatase activity
was assessed on the frozen aliquots by radioassay and immunohistochemistry was done on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections (see below).
The activity of the enzyme was measured using the radiolabeled substrate
[1h-3H]androst-4-ene-3,17-dione (Perkin-Elmer) as previously reported (6).
Aromatase activity was then correlated with protein expression by
immunohistochemistry using linear regression analysis (6).
Lung tissue microarray. A lung tissue microarray (TMA) was
constructed under appropriate Institutional Review Board and Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act regulations, using archival
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue samples from the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the University of California
at Los Angeles Medical Center as previously described (8). The TMA
contained tissue from 696 surgical specimens from 671 patients. Of these
samples, 422 were marker-informative cases linked to outcome information

Aromatase Levels Predict Lung Cancer Survival
(survival versus death due to disease) for individuals with NSCLC. Sampled
tissues included primary lung tumor, matched nonneoplastic lung
parenchyma, and metastatic lung carcinoma to lymph nodes and distant
sites. Sections of all blocks that were used were reviewed by a boardcertified pathologist to confirm the diagnosis. At least three core tissue
biopsies, each 0.6 mm in diameter, were taken from select, morphologically
representative regions of each paraffin-embedded lung tumor and precisely
arrayed using a custom-built instrument, as previously described (8, 20–22).
Supplementary Table S1 summarizes the patient cohort used in this study.
The demographics, histopathologic distribution, grade, stage, clinical
variables, smoking history, and outcome (survival and death due to disease)
of the population studied here were similar to those reported in the United
States (ref. 23; American Cancer Society. Cancer Facts & Figures 2006;
American Lung Association, Trends in Lung Cancer Morbidity and
Mortality, May 2005; National Cancer Institute, SEER Cancer Statistics
Review, 1975–2003). Individuals who were classified as ‘‘nonsmokers’’ had
no history of ever smoking cigarettes. Individuals classified as ‘‘smokers’’
had all smoked >100 cigarettes at one point in their life.
Immunohistochemistry. Lung TMA blocks were sectioned immediately
prior to being stained. The protocol for slide preparation and section
staining has previously been described (6, 21) Goat anti-human aromatase
(CYP19A) antibody C-16 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
The entire lung TMA was stained using a standard two-step indirect
immunohistochemistry protocol (6). Briefly, TMA sections were incubated
in 0.01 mol/L of sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 95jC for 30 min for
antigen retrieval. Endogenous peroxidases were quenched using 3%
hydrogen peroxide, and nonspecific binding was blocked with Background
Sniper (Biocare Medical) for 5 min. After rinsing, slides were incubated with
anti-aromatase antibody (1:100 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature.
Antibody binding was detected using the Dako Envision System with
diaminobenzidine. The sections were counterstained with Harris’ hematoxylin. Negative controls were done on identical TMA sections using the
same protocol as above except with nonimmune goat IgG replacing the
primary antibody. A semiquantitative analysis of the aromatase-stained
lung TMA was done on relevant malignant cells or normal lung epithelium
by a board-certified pathologist (V. Mah) blinded to clinical information,
and spot-checked by a second pathologist (D.B. Seligson). Cytoplasmic
aromatase staining per array spot was determined based on staining
intensity (0, below the level of detection; 1, weak; 2, moderate; and 3, strong)
and the percentage of cells staining at each intensity level (0–100%; ref. 20).
A final integrated value of intensity and frequency was derived using the
following formula: [(3x) + (2y) + (1z)] / 100, where x, y, and z are the
percentages of staining at intensity 3, 2, and 1, respectively. This value was
then used to compare tissue staining.
Statistical analysis. Analyses were done using R software6 (including
survival and rpart packages), which are available for free. Pooling criteria
are discussed in the Supplementary Materials. Aromatase expression
differences among various subgroups were determined using the Wilcoxon
signed rank test or Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum test. For dichotomized (high
versus low) aromatase expression, the Fisher exact test or Pearson m2 test
was used for analysis with categorical variables such as stage, grade, and
smoking history. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier
method and comparisons were done using the log-rank test. The Cox
proportional hazards model (univariate and multivariate) was used to
determine the significance of various factors related to survival. The
proportional hazards assumption was verified using Schoenfeld, martingale,
and dfbeta residuals. Log-rank and Fisher exact P values were two-sided
and a P < 0.05 was considered significant.
The midpoint and median intensity of 1.5 was used to define low and high
aromatase expression. This represents a conservative, nonbiased decision
which was used in order to prevent any artificial overfitting of the data.
However, in addition to this, using recursive partitioning, regression trees
(rpart package), and plotting log-rank P values versus hazard ratios, we
independently determined the cut-point that gave optimal results for the

relevant subpopulations discussed here. This value (1.3) is close to the
midpoint value used here; relevant results and a discussion of this cut-point
determination is presented in the Supplementary Materials. Internal validation to protect against overfitting of data was done as described (24, 25).

Results
Previous results suggest that increased local estrogen levels and/
or enhanced stimulation of the ER signaling pathway might play a
role in lung cancer progression (2–4, 6). In this study, we examined
aromatase, a key enzyme in the estrogen synthesis pathway. We
hypothesized that expression of aromatase in lung cancer cells
could result in a focal increase in estrogen levels and serve to
promote tumor development and/or progression. Recently, we have
shown that aromatase is expressed and is active in human lung
cells (6). An aromatase inhibitor reduces cell growth in vitro and
lung tumor xenograph growth in nude mice (6). To further assess
estrogen signaling in NSCLC in vivo, we implanted A549 lung
tumor cells which express endogenous aromatase in ovariectomized female athymic mice. As shown in Fig. 1, mice treated with
androstenedione, an aromatase substrate, showed significantly
enhanced tumor growth compared with untreated control animals
(P < 0.001). Moreover, treatment with estradiol, the ligand for ER,
showed a similar effect on enhancing lung tumor growth (Fig. 1).
Based on the results above, as well as earlier studies showing
enhanced levels of aromatase expression and activity in NSCLC cell
lines and human tumor samples (6), we initiated a study to
examine the in situ expression of aromatase on a population basis
using a high-density lung TMA consisting of malignant and benign
clinical samples (the clinical and pathologic patient categories of
the TMA are shown in Supplementary Table S1). Protein expression
levels were determined by immunohistochemical staining. In this
study, 1,681 TMA spots were stained representing 422 surgical

Figure 1. Growth-promoting effects of estrogen and aromatase substrate on
non–small cell lung tumor xenografts in vivo . A549 lung tumor cells which
express endogenous aromatase were implanted as subcutaneous xenografts in
ovariectomized female athymic mice. Mice were then divided into three groups
(five animals per group). n, animals were given daily s.c. treatments of the
aromatase substrate androstenedione as previously described (6). ., animals
were given daily s.c. treatments of estradiol in a biodegradable binder as
previously described (19). E, control animals were supplemented with s.c.
injection of vehicle alone. Growth of A549 tumors was significantly increased in
mice treated with androstenedione and estradiol as compared with control
animals (P < 0.001 for both).

cases. Aromatase displayed a cytoplasmic localization with
patterns ranging from below the level of detection (score of 0.0)
to abundant (score of 3.0; Fig. 2A–G). Moreover, aromatase staining
intensity as determined by immunohistochemistry, correlated well
with aromatase enzyme activity as assessed by a radioassay (Fig. 3).
Aromatase staining was observed in all tumor subtypes as well as
nonneoplastic bronchial/bronchiolar epithelium. On a per-spot
basis, mean integrated staining intensities (a measure of intensity
and cellular frequency; see Materials and Methods) were similar
among adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, large cell
carcinomas, and nonneoplastic bronchial epithelium (Fig. 2H).
Aromatase expression predicts disease outcome in women.
Despite the lack of significant differences of aromatase staining on
a per-spot basis, there was patient-to-patient diversity in the
staining pattern. Therefore, we examined whether aromatase
expression levels offered any predictive value for patient survival
from disease-related death. We first examined aromatase expression
as a continuous variable. Using the univariate Cox proportional
hazards model, aromatase expression approached significance as a
predictor of survival (P = 0.056; hazard ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence
level, 0.994–1.65). To consider whether aromatase expression was
predictive for a subset of the population, we next studied a dichotomized population. We initially chose the midpoint-integrated
intensity (1.5 on a scale of 0.0–3.0) to define ‘‘higher’’ and ‘‘lower’’
expression of aromatase (see Materials and Methods). Coincidentally, 1.5 was also the median value for aromatase-integrated

immunohistochemistry as described in Materials and Methods. The correlation
between immunohistochemistry and aromatase activity was then assessed
by linear regression analysis with the correlation coefficient r = 0.95.

expression in the patient population. As shown in Fig. 4A, there was
a slight survival advantage for individuals with lower levels of
aromatase expression compared with individuals with higher levels
(P = 0.008). Significantly, upon dividing the population by gender, a
predictive value for aromatase expression was observed for women
(Fig. 4B; P = 0.009) but not for men (Fig. 4C; P = 0.182). This
observation did not seem to be due to differences in the cellular
expression or activity of aromatase in the lungs in women compared
with men (ref. 6; Supplementary Table S2).
We further stratified the female population according to age
(e.g., age cutoffs of 50, 55, 60, 65, and 70 years) and examined the

predictive capability of aromatase expression in each age group.
Aromatase levels were not predictive of disease outcome in women
younger than 65 years of age with lung cancer. However, as shown
in Fig. 4D, women 65 years and older had a striking survival
advantage if they expressed lower levels of aromatase (P = 0.006),
with 79% of these women surviving 5 years post-surgery compared
with only 49% survival in the population of women with higher
aromatase.
Aromatase expression is an early-stage predictive tumor
marker. We next subdivided the population based on disease
stage. For individuals with stage III or IV NSCLC, aromatase

65 years and older and had lower aromatase expression were found to have an increased probability of survival compared with those with higher tumor aromatase
expression (P = 0.0061).

expression levels did not display any significant associations with
disease outcome (data not shown). In contrast, for patients of all
genders with earlier stage lung cancer (stage I and II), lower levels
of aromatase predicted greater survival (Fig. 5A; P = 0.005).
Furthermore, this predictive value was gender-specific with low
aromatase predicting greater survival probability in women
(Fig. 5B; P = 0.010) but not men (Fig. 5C; P = 0.152) with stage
I/II disease. Of the 157 cases of women who were afflicted with
stage I and II NSCLC, the 5-year survival among the population
with lower aromatase (n = 81) was 81%, whereas the survival

far more pronounced in women 65 years and older (Fig. 5D; P =

validation of survival predictions, done as described using 400

This set consisted of 337 patients with a breakdown of 183 women
(104 women ages 65 or over, 79 women under the age of 65) and
154 men. The median staining intensity was used to divide the
patient groups as described above. Significantly, an identical pattern
was identified for the predictive power of aromatase levels
and survival in women z65 years old with early-stage NSCLC
completely consistent with results from the University of California
at Los Angeles patient cohort (P = 0.005; Supplementary Fig. S2).
Aromatase expression and NSCLC in women with no
smoking history. The population of women with NSCLC was
further analyzed in order to identify any associations based on
smoking history. Women were dichotomized into those who had
smoked >100 cigarettes at any point in their lifetime (smokers), and
those who had never smoked (nonsmokers; see Materials and
Methods). Within the population of women (all ages) who had
smoked during their lifetime, there was a slightly reduced—albeit
not statistically significant—predicted survival advantage with
lower levels of aromatase (Fig. 6A; P = 0.063). Although in this
particular patient cohort, the subset of women who had no
smoking history, yet developed NSCLC, was relatively small, there
was still a highly significant predictive value for survival with lower
tumor aromatase levels (Fig. 6B; P = 0.022) with a 5-year survival
percentage of 92% (n = 20) compared with a 49% survival
percentage for women with higher tumor aromatase (n = 15).
Finally, we addressed whether aromatase expression had
predictive information beyond other known NSCLC prognostic
indicators such as tumor stage, tumor grade, and patient age. In
multivariate Cox proportional hazards models, aromatase as either
a continuous (P = 0.0015; Table 1) or dichotomized (P = 0.0042)
variable was a significant independent predictor of survival for
women ages 65 and older.

Discussion
In this study, we have identified aromatase expression levels as
an early-stage predictive biomarker of lung cancer survival.
Specifically, lower relative levels of aromatase predict a higher
probability of survival in women with NSCLC who are 65 years of
age and older. The predictive power of aromatase expression was
particularly informative at earlier stages of lung cancer (stage I and
II). In contrast, women with higher aromatase expression have a
worse prognosis.
For malignancies such as breast cancer, stimulation of the ER
pathway contributes to the pathogenesis of this disease (26). The
pathogenic effect of estrogen is thought to be a by-product of
estrogen metabolism and/or estrogen-induced gene transcription
promoting the proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis (26). It is
now appreciated that the normal lung is also responsive to
estrogen for regulating differentiation and development (2). We
and others have hypothesized that increased local estrogen levels
and/or enhanced stimulation of the ER signaling pathway also
plays a role in lung cancer progression (2–4, 6). As part of this

concept, we predict that lung cancer cells may adopt one or more
strategies to maintain or enhance the ER signaling pathway,
including the local production of estrogens via aromatasecatalyzed biosynthesis.
It is intriguing that aromatase expression levels are most
predictive in a later age in women. That this is purely due to
diminishing levels of circulating estrogen in postmenopausal
women is unlikely because the median age for menopause is
f51 years. However, circulating levels of androgens (e.g., androstenedione and testosterone), the substrate for aromatase, remain
relatively constant in women throughout menopausal changes, and
gradually decrease after age 65 (27–31). Therefore, we predict that in
such situations in which systemic levels of estrogen are relatively
decreased due to declined estrogen produced by the ovaries (32)
and androgen levels are decreasing, tumor cells and/or neighboring
host cells might compensate by increasing the endogenous
production of estrogen through aromatase. Growth factor receptor
signaling pathways may also contribute to the increased expression
and activity of aromatase, thereby further stimulating estrogen
biosynthesis in NSCLC cells (33). In contrast to these results,
we observed no predictive value for aromatase expression levels in
men of any age. Of note, estrogen levels in men stay relatively
constant with age (34). Thus, it is possible that in men with lung
cancer, an alternate strategy is employed to enhance ER pathway
signaling.
An interesting yet surprising finding was the association
between aromatase levels and survival differences in women with
NSCLC and no smoking history. In this subpopulation, >90% of
women who had lower aromatase expression survived beyond
5 years. As a cautionary note, although these latter results are

statistically significant, the population size was very small (n = 20);
it will be important to verify this finding in a larger study.
It is intriguing to consider that in addition to allowing a
predictive stratification of NSCLC patients, these results may also
suggest novel therapeutic approaches to treat NSCLC using
currently available aromatase inhibitors. Aromatase inhibitors are
showing promising results in malignancies such as breast cancer
(16–18). Of note, a recent trial was conducted in which
postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer either
remained on tamoxifen or were switched to a third-generation
aromatase inhibitor, exemestane (17). Significantly, there was a
reduction in the subsequent development of primary lung cancer
in the cohort on exemestane compared with those women
maintained on tamoxifen (17). Thus, a compelling prediction of
the current study is that aromatase inhibitors may be a beneficial
addition to the armamentarium of compounds currently being
used to treat and possibly prevent lung cancer.
