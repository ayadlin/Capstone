ABSTRACT
The aim of this study was to explore the role of long non-coding RNA UCA1
(urothelial cancer-associated 1) in acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor
receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC). In our study, UCA1 expression was significantly increased in lung
cancer cells and patients with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Over-expression
of UCA1 was significantly associated with a shorter progression-free survival (PFS)
[13.0 vs. 8.5 months, P < 0.01] in tumors with respond to EGFR-TKIs. The significant
relationship was not observed in patients with T790M mutation (10.5 vs. 12.0 months,
P = 0.778), but in patients with non-T790M (19.0 vs. 9.0 months, P = 0.023). UCA1
knockdown restored gefitinib sensitivity in acquired resistant cells with non-T790M
and inhibited the activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT). The mTOR inhibitor was effective in UCA1-expressing cell PC9/R.
Inhibiting mTOR could change the expression of UCA1, although there was no
significant difference. In conclusion, the influence of over-expression of UCA1 on
PFS for patients with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs was from the subgroup with
non-T790M mutation. UCA1 may induce non-T790M acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs
by activating the AKT/mTOR pathway and EMT.

INTRODUCTION

develops, and the majority of EGFR-mutated NSCLCs
that respond to EGFR-TKIs develop acquired resistance
after approximately 12 months [5, 6]. The most common
mechanism whereby acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs
develops is a secondary T790M mutation [7]. As well as
this mechanism, c-MET amplification(5-10%), PIK3CA
mutations(~5%), BRAF mutations(~1%) and small-cell
lung cancer transformation(~5%) are also associated
with acquired resistance to TKIs [8-10]. However, the
mechanisms responsible for about 30% of cases of

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) such as gefitinib and
erlotinib are first-line treatments for advanced non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR-activating
mutations, and have been reported to improve the
clinical outcome and quality-of-life of patients with this
malignancy [1-4]. However, acquired resistance invariably

acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs are still unknown [10].
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a group
of non-coding transcripts of more than 200 nt that are
involved in cell apoptosis, tumor invasion, metastasis, and
drug resistance [11, 12]. Multiple studies have indicated
that lncRNAs, including H19 [13], CUDR [14], and
AK126698 [15] are related to chemotherapy resistance.
In a previous study [16], we compared the expression
of lncRNAs in gefitinib-sensitive and gefitinib-resistant
human lung cancer cells by lncRNA microarray analysis,
and found that some lncRNAs, including UCA1 (urothelial
cancer-associated 1), were up-regulated in resistant cells.
In an effort to overcome resistance, we have
investigated the molecular mechanisms of acquired
resistance in epigenetic genetics. In the present study,
we sought to determine whether the lncRNA UCA1
can induce acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs via cell
apoptosis and activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
in EGFR-mutant lung cancer.

patients with primary resistance(0.072 ± 0.013 vs 0.21
± 0.05, P = 0.0068; Figure 1D). On the basis of the
UCA1 expression before treatment with EGFR-TKIs, the
patients were divided into a high expression group (n =
20) and a low expression group (n = 32), depending on
whether they were above or below the cut-off value 2-ΔCt =
0.068 (Supplementary Table S1). When progression free
survival(PFS) was assessed, patients in the high UCA1
expression group had a significantly poorer prognosis
than those in the low expression group (median PFS
8.5m vs 13.0m, P = 0.0068; Figure 1E). The objective
response rate (ORR) in the high UCA1 expression group
was significantly lower than in the low expression group
(52.94% vs 84.21%, P = 0.014; Figure 1F). Univariate
analysis of PFS revealed that the expression level of
UCA1 and age were prognostic indicators (Table 3), while
multivariate analysis indicated that the UCA1 expression
level and age were independent prognostic factors for PFS
in patients with EGFR-TKI-sensitive NSCLC. Therefore,
we hypothesized that UCA1 may play an important role
in acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs and influence the
efficacy of EGFR-TKIs.

RESULTS

The impact of over-expression of UCA1 on PFS
for patients with acquired resistance to EGFRTKIs was from T790M-negative subgroup

Over-expression of UCA1 was correlated with
acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs
To identify the mechanisms of acquired resistance
to EGFR-TKIs, we conducted microarray expression
profiling of lncRNAs/mRNA for PC9 and PC9/R cells.
UCA1 was found to have a high expression level in PC9/R
cells with acquired resistance to gefitinib[16]. To validate
the analysis of lncRNAs profiles, we assessed the mRNA
expression of UCA1 by RT-PCR in lung cancer cell lines
and patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC. A total of 89
patients were enrolled in this study. Of them, the clinical
characteristics of the 84 patients with EGFR-mutant
NSCLC who had enough samples obtained from either
before EGFR-TKIs treatment or after development of
acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs were shown in Table 1
and that of the other 5 patients who had matched samples
were shown in Table 2.
Over-expression of UCA1 was observed in lung
cancer cells with acquired resistance (PC9/R and H1975)
[P < 0.01] (Figure 1A). And UCA1 mRNA expression
level in patients who developed acquired resistance
to EGFR-TKIs was significantly higher than in the
baseline group with EGFR-TKI-sensitive NSCLC (0.58
± 0.05 vs 0.21 ± 0.05, P = 0.0024; Figure 1B). We also
measured the mRNA expression of UCA1 by RT-PCR in
5 matched EGFR-mutant NSCLC specimens, including
2 with T790M and 3 without T790M(Table 2) [Figure
1C], both before treatment (BT) with EGFR-TKIs and
after the development of resistance to TKIs, and found
that UCA1 expression was up-regulated in patients with
acquired resistance. Whereas it was down-regulated in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We observed the expression level of UCA1 was
significantly higher in patients with acquired resistance to
EGFR-TKIs regardless of the status of T790M mutation
than in BT group (subgroup without T790M, 0.57 ± 0.24
vs 0.21 ± 0.05, P = 0.036; Figure 2A) (subgroup with
T790M, 0.64 ± 0.18 vs 0.21 ± 0.05, P = 0.0028; Figure
2C). However, the expression of UCA1 was significantly
associated with PFS in only patients without T790M
mutations (P = 0.023; Figure 2B). The relationship was not
observed in patients with T790M mutations (P = 0.778;
Figure 2D). Therefore, we hypothesized that UCA1 may
play an important role in acquired resistance to EGFRTKIs in patients without T790M mutations.

UCA1 inhibition restored gefitinib sensitivity in
acquired resistant cell lines without T790M in
vitro and in vivo
To assess the role of UCA1 in acquired resistance
to EGFR-TKIs, the effect of UCA1 on cell proliferation
and apoptosis was investigated. The silencing capacity of
si-UCA1 was evaluated by using qRT-PCR. Si-UCA1-1
showed an optimal effect in comparison with si-UCA1-2
and the negative control (NC) [Figures 3A, 3C]. After
inhibiting the UCA1 gene, the sensitivity to gefitinib was
partly restored in PC9/R cells, but this effect was not
observed in H1975 cells (Figures 3B, 3D).

UCA1 may promote activation of the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway and EMT

TKI-resistant NSCLC cells in vivo, we established a
gefitinib-resistant PC9/R model. Consistent with previous
observations, we found that gefitinib plus si-UCA1
treatment inhibited tumor growth, but these changes were
not observed in blank control and gefitinib plus negative
control (NC)-treated tumors (Figure 3E, 3F). These
results were consistent with our clinical data and further
confirmed our hypothesis.
As refractoriness to apoptosis induced by EGFRTKIs is one of the major features of resistance to targeted
therapy in NSCLC, the effect of UCA1 on cell apoptosis
was examined. We observed that caspase 3 and caspase 8
(the activation of which may be involved in cell apoptosis)
were both increased by transfecting si-UCA1 (Figure 3G).
A significantly higher percentage of apoptotic cells were
found in si-UCA1-treated cells (26.8%) in comparison
with those transfected with the negative control (7.9%)
[Figure 3H]. Taken together, these results indicate that
inhibition of UCA1 induces apoptosis in cells resistant to
EGFR-TKIs.

Based on the latest KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes) database, a pathway analysis was
performed for differentially expressed mRNAs in both
PC9 and PC9/R cell lines before UCA1 knockdown.
Among these, enriched pathways relating to mTOR
signaling suggested a role in acquired resistance to
EGFR-TKIs (Figure 4A). PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK
are two crucial downstream signaling pathways for EGFR
[17]. Therefore, to explore the underlying molecular
mechanisms of EGFR-TKI resistance, we assessed
whether UCA1 affects the expression of crucial proteins
in these signaling pathways. Western blot analysis
showed that the expressions of phospho-EGFR (pEGFR),
phospho-AKT (pAKT), phospho-ERK (pERK), and
phospho-mTOR (pmTOR) were positively correlated
with the expressions of UCA1 among si-UCA1-treated
PC9/R cells and negative control (NC)- treated PC9/R

EGFR-TKIs [22, 23]. However, lncRNAs can connect
to transcription sites and regulate both the expression of
alleles and a long fragment, whereas coding genes and
micro-RNAs have no such functions, which suggests
that lncRNAs may be better epigenetic regulators in
controlling performance [24]. Moreover, the function of
lncRNAs in the development of acquired resistance to
EGFR-TKIs is still unknown. Therefore, we explored the
role and possible molecular mechanism of lncRNAs in
acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC.
To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms
of EGFR-TKI resistance, we compared the expression
profile of lncRNAs between gefitinib-sensitive and
gefitinib-resistant human lung cancer cells by lncRNA
microarray and found that thousands of lncRNAs were
up-regulated in gefitinib-resistant cells [16]. In addition,
through bioinformatic analysis, we identified that the
lncRNA-UCA1 is related to cell apoptosis, proliferation,
and chemoresistance. UCA1 was first identified in bladder
cancer cells and is involved in bladder cancer invasion
and progression [25]. As it was observed that UCA1 is upregulated in liver, colon and stomach cancers, it may be a
biomarker for the diagnosis of these cancers [26, 27]. Of
note, UCA1 has been shown to be up-regulated in lung
cancer and induce chemoresistance [27].
One of important findings of this study was that
over-expression of UCA1 in lung cancer cells and patients
with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Our clinical
data demonstrated that UCA1 expression levels were
significantly higher in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who
developed acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs compared
with before treatment levels, suggesting that high
expression of UCA1 may be a mechanism of resistance
to EGFR-TKIs. Meanwhile, the high expression of UCA1
was correlated with the poorer prognosis than those in
the low expression group. Univariate and multivariate
analysis of PFS revealed that UCA1 and age were
independent prognostic factors. However, we found that
over-expression UCA1 was not significantly associated
with PFS for patients with T790M acquired resistance

impact on mTOR pathway(Supplementary Figure S4).
To confirm that si-UCA1 can inhibit PI3K/AKT
and ERK signaling pathways in vivo, we assessed the
expression of EGFR, pEGFR, AKT, pAKT, ERK, and
pERK. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed that the
expression levels of pEGFR, pAKT and pERK were
significantly higher in blank control and gefitinib plus
NC-treated tumors than in gefitinib plus si-UCA1-treated
tumors (Figure 4D) [Supplementary Figure S1]. Thus,
these in vivo data complemented the functional studies
of UCA1 in vitro in demonstrating that UCA1 is capable
of promoting EGFR-TKI resistance in vivo. Accordingly,
si-UCA1 may overcome gefitinib resistance which is not
caused by T790M.
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a
critical role in resistance to EGFR-TKIs, with a decrease
of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and an increase
of mesenchymal markers such as vimentin [18, 19].
An association between UCA1 and markers of EMT
was observed. The results indicated that knockdown of
UCA1 enhanced the expression of E-cadherin, whereas
the expression of vimentin, Snail, and N-cadherin were
attenuated (Figure 4B).
Taken together, these findings indicate that the
expression of UCA1 is positively correlated with pEGFR,
pAKT, pERK and pmTOR, but is not related to MET.
Thus, UCA1 may activate AKT/mTOR, ERK pathways
and EMT to promote resistance to gefitinib.

DISCUSSION
The majority of patients with EGFR-mutant lung
cancers eventually develop acquired resistance to EGFRTKIs [5, 6]. However, the mechanisms responsible for
most patients with non-T790M acquired resistance to
EGFR-TKIs are still unknown [10]. It is known that
epigenetics especial non-coding RNAs play a key role in
EGFR-TKIs resistance [20, 21]. In previous studies, we
reported that miR-21, miR-214 and miR-200 are involved
in both acquired resistance and primary resistance to

to EGFR-TKIs, although the significant high expression
level of UCA1 in NSCLC with acquired resistance
regardless of T790M status was observed. We therefore
hypothesized that high expression of UCA1 may be one of
the mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in
EGFR-mutant NSCLC without T790M. We also validated
the effect of UCA1 on EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC

cells in vitro and in vivo.
In vitro, we observed that UCA1 knockdown can
partly restore the sensitivity of PC9/R cells (19DEL,
without T790M and MET amplification), but this change
was not observed in H1975 cells (L858R/T790M). In vivo,
we also found that gefitinib in combination with si-UCA1
inhibited tumor growth in gefitinib-resistant PC9/R model.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The data were consistent with the cell experiments and
further confirmed our hypothesis.
Our study also showed that UCA1-mediated
acquired resistance to gefitinib may occur through
activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway and EMT. Previous
studies have implicated activation of the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR and ERK pathways as well as EMT in resistance
to EGFR-TKIs [28-30]. Subsequently, other studies have
reported that UCA1 can promote cell proliferation and
invasiveness by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway [3133]. These studies confirm the validity of our results. In
addition, the effects of UCA1 on cell proliferation and
invasiveness in our study were similar to those of Nodal
in breast cancer. Nodal has been demonstrated to promote
invasiveness and metastasis in breast cancer cells via EMT
and ERK pathway activation [34]. Besides, Li ZK et al.
have reported that UCA1 promotes glycolysis through the
mTOR pathway. They considered UCA1 was associated
with the mTOR pathway [35]. Therefore, base on our data,
we considered UCA1 may be associated with AKT/mTOR
and ERK pathways and EMT. Further investigations will
be required to elucidate the mechanisms by which UCA1
regulates the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and EMT.
We therefore hypothesized that UCA1-mediated acquired
resistance in the absence of T790M mutations is likely
to be related to activation of the AKT/mTOR and ERK
pathways.
Recently, new generation EGFR-TKIs such as CO1686 and AZD9291 have been found to be irreversible
inhibitors that can overcome acquired resistance caused by
T790M [36-39]. To date, however, patients without T790M
mutations who develop acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs
have no effective treatment, as the mechanisms of acquired
resistance remain unclear. Some studies have reported that
the histone lysine-specific demethylase 1(LSD1) enzyme
EZH2 may be a new “druggable” epigenetic target [4042]. Therefore, we consider that UCA1 may play a key
role in overcoming non-T790M acquired resistance to
EGFR-TKIs by functioning as a new epigenetic regulator
in NSCLC.
In conclusion, we have identified that UCA1 overexpression was significantly associated with poor outcome
of NSCLC patients with acquired resistance to EGFRTKIs and the impact of over-expression of UCA1 on PFS
for patients with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs was
from non-T790M subgroup. We consider over-expression
of UCA1 as a novel mechanism by which acquired
resistance to EGFR-TKIs can develop in EGFR-mutant
NSCLC patients without T790M mutations. UCA1 may
regulate resistance to gefitinib through activation of the
AKT/mTOR pathway and EMT. Further studies will be
required to elucidate the precise mechanisms of UCA1mediated acquired resistance.

were collected from NSCLC patients who had either an
exon 19 deletion (19DEL) or an exon 21 point mutation
(L858R) in their EGFRs, and were treated with either
gefitinib or erlotinib between January 2012 and December
2013, with the written consent of the patients involved
and the approval of the Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital
Ethics Committee. All patients had either prolonged stable
disease (SD) of more than 6 months or a partial response
(PR) to EGFR-TKIs therapy and 42 of 89 patients met
the established clinical definition of acquired resistance
to EGFR-TKIs [5]. Five of these 42 patients had available
samples obtained before EGFR-TKIs treatment and
after acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs. Efficacy data
were monitored until the end of June 2014. Of these 94
collected samples, 42 were collected from patients after
they developed acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs(defined
as AR group), other 52 were collected from patients before
EGFR-TKIs treatment(defined as BT group). Of note,
there were 5 matched EGFR-mutant NSCLC samples.
We also collected fourty-six primary resistant
patients. Primary resistance to EGFR-TKI was defined
as progression on the first imaging evaluation or SD <
6 months after EGFR-TKI treatment in the first setting
for patients with NSCLC harboring an activating EGFR
mutation.

Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction(qRT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from the lung cancer
cell lines using TRIzol reagent (TaKaRa, Japan) or from
tissue samples using an RNeasy Mini Kit(QIAGEN).
The expression of UCA1 in lung cancer cell lines and
tissues was measured by qPCR methodology using SYBR
Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa) and an MX3000P instrument.
UCA1 primers were designed by Sangon Biotech (China).
Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase(GAPDH)
was used as a control. All experiments were performed in

were purchased from Abcam(Cambridge, UK).

Xenograft study

PC9/R and H1975 lung cancer cells (2×105) were
seeded into each well of 6-well plates and incubated
overnight, and then transfected with 100nmol/L of smallinterfering (si)-UCA1-1 or si-UCA1-2 and a negative
control (NC) purchased from RiboBio (Guangzhou,
China) that consisted of Lipofectamine 2000 transfection
reagent (Invitrogen, USA). The target sequence for siUCA1-1 was as follows:
sense
strand,
5’-GCCACCUACAUUAAAGCUAdTdT-3’, antisense
strand, 3‘-dTdT CGGUGGAUGUAAUUUCGAU-5’.
Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were
harvested for real-time PCR or western blot analysis.

For this part of the study, 5-week-old female specific
pathogen-free (SPF) nude mice were used. The animal
studies were approved by our Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee, and were performed according to
institutional guidelines. PC9/R cells were injected into
the right flanks of the mice, and gefitinib treatment was
started 10 days after the tumor cell inoculation. Gefitinib
was administered by oral gavage on 5 days per week at a
dosage of 25mg/kg in 1% Tween 80 (Sigma). Si-UCA-1
or the negative control was administered as intratumoral
injections.
Tumor sizes were assessed three times per week by
a digital caliper. The tumor volumes were determined by
measuring their length (l) and width (w) and calculating
the volume (V) as follows: V = lw2/2. After 30 days, the
mice were killed and paraffin-embedded tissues were
prepared for immunohistochemical (IHC) staining.

Cell proliferation and apoptosis assays

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)

After transfection, the cells were seeded overnight
at a density of 5×103 cells in 96-well plates in DMEM
containing 10% FBS, and then exposed to various
concentrations of gefitinib for 72hours. 10μLof CCK8 reagent (Dojingdo Molecular Technology, Japan) was
added to the cells for 1hour at 37°C, and the absorbance in
each well was measured at 450 nm by an enzyme-labeled
instrument.
The PC9/R cells were seeded in 6-well plates for
24hours and then transfected with si-UCA1-1 and the
negative control. After gefitinib treatment for 72hours,
the cells were trypsinized, washed twice with PBS, and
resuspended in binding buffer. They were then stained
with Annexin V/PI (Invitrogen, USA) for 15min in the
dark at room temperature, and the cell populations were
analyzed by a flow cytometer.

Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded xenograft
tumors 4µm thick were dewaxed in xylene, hydrated in
graded alcohols, and washed with PBS. After blocking
endogenous peroxidase activity with 3% H2O2 aqueous
solution for 10 min, the sections were incubated with
primary antibodies overnight. After washing with PBS,
they were then incubated with general-type IgG-HRP
Polymer (Beijing CoWin Biotech Co) for 10min, followed
by 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) for about 2 to 5min.
Finally, the sections were restained with hematoxylin for
1 min and then dehydrated in graded alcohols, cleared
in xylene, and covered with coverslips. We adopted the
H-score system developed by Hirsch et al. and used by
Pirker et al. in the FLEX study [44, 45] to calculate a score
of intensity multiplied by the percentage of stained tumor
cells. We used rabbit polyclonal to EGFR (1:100), pEGFR
[pY1068](1:300), AKT (1:2000), pAKT [pS473](1:200),
ERK (1:200), pERK [Thr202/Tyr204](1:400) as primary
antibodies.

Si-RNA transfection

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed using RIPA protein extraction
reagent (Beyotime, Beijing, China) supplemented with
phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) [Riche, CA,
USA]. Approximately 25µg of protein extracts were
separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred onto
nitrocellulose membranes (Sigma), and incubated with
specific antibodies. An enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL)
chromogenic substrate was used to visualize the bands.
The blots were developed with a chemiluminescence
system, and GAPDH was used as a control. All antibodies

Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS version 17.0 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA). Results were presented as the means ±standard
deviation (SD) or Standard Error of Mean (SEM) of 3
separate assays. Differences between the different groups
were assessed using a t-test (two-tailed). Cumulative
survival was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method,
and differences were assessed using the log-rank test.
