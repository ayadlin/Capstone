Abstract
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is driven by cancer-initiating cells (CIC), but their
maintenance mechanisms are obscure. For hematopoietic stem cells, low levels of intracellular reactive
oxygen species (ROSLow) is known to help sustain stemness properties. In this report, we evaluated
the hypothesis that ROSLow character conferred CIC properties in HNSCC. Sphere cultures deﬁne CIC in
HNSCC cell populations (HN-CIC). We found that ROSLow cells in HN-CIC deﬁned in this manner were
more numerous than in parental HNSCC cells. Further, ROSLow cells frequently coexpressed CIC surface
markers such as memGrp78 and Glut3. Exploiting ﬂow cytometry to sort cells on the basis of their ROS level,
we found that isolated ROSLow cells displayed relatively more CIC properties, including quiescence,
chemoresistance, in vitro malignant properties, and tumorigenicity. Pharmacological depletion of ROS
modulators in cisplatin-treated HN-CIC reduced CIC properties, enhancing cell differentiation and
enhancing cisplatin-induced cell death. Overall, our work deﬁned cell subpopulations in HNSCC on the
basis of differential intracellular ROS levels, which associated with stemness and chemoresistance
properties. On the basis of our ﬁndings, we suggest that strategies to promote intracellular ROS levels
may heighten the efﬁcacy of conventional chemotherapy used for HNSCC treatment. Cancer Res; 74(21);

cells (CSC)], in that, each tumor formation is generated from
a distinct subset of cells with characteristics of self-renewal
and differentiation capacity (1). Clinically, conventional
chemotherapeutics generally affect proliferative cells, potentially eliminate proliferating cancer cells but do not target
slow dividing cells (2). Like normal tissue stem cells, CICs
also exhibit quiescent slow-cycling phenotype (3). In addition, CICs have been shown to be involved in tumor progression, cancer recurrence, and metastasis because of their
therapeutic resistance (4, 5). Therefore, to uncover the
regulatory physiologic mechanisms that sustain the slowgrowing CICs warrants an important study for future therapy development.
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) ranks the
sixth most common cancer worldwide (6). Previously, we have
enriched and identiﬁed the existence of a subpopulation of
head and neck CICs (HN-CIC) from sphere cells. The enriched
HN-CICs from HNSCC cells display both the enhanced properties of stemness and malignancy (7). In addition, the cell
surface markers such as CD133 (8) and cell membrane anchoring GRP78 (memGRP78; ref. 9) for identifying the HN-CICs have
also been reported in our previous studies. However, the
unique physiology and regulatory mechanisms that mediate
the HN-CIC properties of clinical refraction remain elusive.
Therefore, the studies on targeting the mechanism(s) in

HN-CICs to contribute to the therapeutic resistance of
HNSCC would beneﬁt future HNSCC therapy.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide (O2 ),
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the hydroxyl radical (HO ), play
a major role to cellular proliferation, differentiation, and
survival (10). It has recently been shown that stem cells have
a unique mechanism, which is important to cope with the
accumulated ROS, to increase antioxidant defenses and to play
a crucial redox regulator on self-renewal and differentiation,
(11–13). For instance, hematopoietic stem cells maintain a low
intracellular ROS status that in turn facilitates quiescence,
whereas a higher ROS state activates cell proliferation and
differentiation but exhausts self-renewal in these cells (14).
Achuthan and colleagues (15) demonstrate that drug-induced
senescence generates chemoresistant stem-like cells with low
ROS in breast cancer. In addition, a lower level of intracellular
ROS is also present in breast CSCs, which may contribute to
radioresistance (16). Overall, these studies have led to the
hypothesis that the maintenance of low ROS levels within the
CICs is important for regulating chemoresistance and quiescent state.
Cancer cells are capable of maintained at an oxidation-reduction reactions (redox) homeostasis state by upregulating ROSscavenging enzymes, which can confer drug resistance (17).
Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase,
and peroxiredoxin are major intracellular ROS-scavenging
enzymes (17). Furthermore, accumulating evidence supports
that elevated activity of SOD and catalase is associated with
promoting cancer cell resistance to anticancer agents (15, 18, 19).
In this study, we determined the tumorigenic potential and
stemness properties of subpopulation cells with the differential
intracellular level of ROS in HNSCCs and HN-CICs. We showed
that the HN-CICs possessed more ROSLow cells than HNSCCs
did. Then, we demonstrated the cells of low level of ROS highly
coexpressed the stem cell markers (CD133, memGrp78, and
Glut3) and the subpopulation of ROSLow cells was expanded in
ALDHþ cells than in ALDH cells. Furthermore, three types of
cells with differential level of ROS: the high, middle, and low
level of ROS (termed "ROSHigh," "ROSMedi," and "ROSLow") were
isolated, respectively. The isolated ROSLow cells displayed CIC
properties and possessed high tumorigenicity. Lower ROS level
in CICs was also associated with chemoresistance, and pharmacologic depletion of ROS scavengers enhanced the chemosensitivity but diminished the clonogenicity of HN-CICs. In
summary, our studies suggest that distinct subpopulation of
cells with differential ROS level exerted diverse stemness
properties, chemoresistance, and tumorigenicity in HNSCC,
and eliminating ROSLow cells should be considered for further
exploration on therapeutic development for HNSCC.
Together, abrogation of drug-resistant mechanisms by
depletion of ROS scavengers in CICs could have signiﬁcant
therapeutic implications in the future.

sources (20) were cultured in DMEM medium with 10% FBS.
Human gingival squamous carcinoma cells (OECM-1) were
provided from Dr. C.L. Meng (National Defense Medical
College, Taipei, Taiwan) and grown in RPMI supplemented
with 10% FBS. Cells were cultured at 37 C containing 5%
CO2.
Establishment of the primary cells from patients with
HNSCC
This research follows the tenets of the Declaration of
Helsinki and all samples were obtained after informed
consent from the patients. The clinical samples were
approved and in accordance with the Institutional Review
Board (IRB no., 2012-07-035BCY), Taipei Veterans General
Hospital. Primary HN-CICs were established from patients
with HNSCC that derived from specimens of oral surgical
resection. The primary HN-CICs were cultured in serum-free
DMEM/F12 medium (GIBCO), N2 supplement (GIBCO), 10
ng/mL EGF, and 10 ng/mL human recombinant basic ﬁbroblast growth factor-basic (bFGF; R&D Systems). Otherwise,
the primary HNSCCs were cultured in RPMI supplemented
with 10% FBS.
Cell lines cultivation and enrichment of HN-CICs
The two cell lines SAS and OECM1 were plated at a density of
7.5  104 live cells per 10-mm dish, then cultured in tumor
sphere medium consisting of serum-free DMEM/F12 medium
(GIBCO), N2 supplement (GIBCO), 10 ng/mL human recombinant bFGF-basic, and 10 ng/mL EGF (R&D Systems). The
medium was changed every other day until the tumor sphere
formation was achieved to enrich the SAS-HN-CICs or OECM1HN-CICs in about 4 weeks (7).
Establishment of cisplatin-resistant cell line
The cisplatin-resistant (SAS-cisPtR) cells were generated by
serially fractionated exposure of the parental SAS cell lines to
cisplatin over a time period of 3 months. At 5 mmol/L of
cisplatin killed more than 50% of cells for 48 hours, cells were
allowed to recover over 20 days with fresh medium and
repeated three times. The cisplatin-resistant (SAS-cisPtR) cells
were for further experiments (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Cell viability and chemoresistance assay
Cells were seeded onto 24-well culture plates at 1  104 cells
per well for 24 hours. Then the test drugs were added to the
culture medium for 72 hours. Subsequently, 5 mL of MTT
solution (4 mg MTT/mL PBS) was added to each well and the
cells were further incubated at 37 C for 3 hours until a purple
Formazan was visible. The staining solution was removed and
100 mL DMSO was added at room temperature in the dark for
30 minutes. The absorbance of DMSO solution was detected
with a microtiter plate reader at 560 nm. The cell viability ratio
is calculated as OD560 of experimental groups/OD560 of
control groups.

mmol/L CellROX Deep Red, or 5 mmol/L Carboxy-DCFDA
(Invitrogen) at 37 C for 30 minutes, respectively. Cells were
washed and resuspended in 10 mmol/L propidium iodide (PI)
solution for analysis or sorting by using FACSAria cell sorter
(Becton Dickinson). For all FACS experiments, the dead cells
were excluded by PI staining.
Anchorage-independent growth assay
Each well (35 mm) of a 6-well culture dish was coated
with 2 mL bottom agar (Sigma-Aldrich) mixture [DMEM,
10% (v/v) FBS, 0.6% (w/v) agar]. After the bottom layer was
solidiﬁed, sorted cells were cultured in 2 mL top agar
medium mixture [DMEM, 10% (v/v) FBS, 0.3% (w/v) agar],
and the dishes were incubated for 2 weeks at 37 C. Subsequently, plates were stained with 0.005% Crystal Violet then
the colonies were counted. The number of total colonies was
counted over ﬁve ﬁelds per well for a total of 15 ﬁelds in
triplicate experiments.
In vivo tumorigenic assay
All animal studies were approved and in accordance with the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of
National Yang-Ming University (Taipei, Taiwan; IACUC
approval no., 1001223). Equal volume of cells and Matrigel

nude mice (6–8 weeks). Tumor volume was calculated using
the following formula: (Length  Width2)/2.

Results
Quantiﬁcation of intracellular ROS level and
coexpression of CIC surface markers in parental HNSCCs
cells, sphere cells, and primary cells established from
HNSCC tumor tissue
It has been demonstrated that cells with low intracellular
ROS concentration are more likely to maintain their stem
properties in hematopoietic stem cells (14). In addition, the
association of low ROS level and radioresistance in breast
CSCs has been reported (16). Previously, we have successfully enriched a subpopulation of HN-CICs derived from
both SAS and OECM1 HNSCCs (7, 9). Herein, we ﬁrst aim to
understand whether the intracellular level of ROS is relatively lower in HN-CICs. To measure the intracellular ROS
level of HN-CICs, the cells were stained with oxidation
sensitive ﬂuorescent probe (DCFDA, CM-DCFDA, or CellROX Deep Red, respectively) followed by ﬂow-cytometry
analysis (14, 16). Compared with parental HNSCCs, we
observed that a subpopulation of cells with low intracellular
level of ROS was signiﬁcantly increased in HN-CICs (for both
SAS-S and OECM1-S; Fig. 1A and B and Supplementary Fig.
S2A). In addition, primary cells (primary-S) freshly established from HNSCC patient tumor tissue grown in deﬁned
serum-free medium with bFGF and EGF growth factors (the
medium to grow the SAS-S and OECM1-S cells) also displayed more cells with low ROS content in comparison with
the same cells cultivated in medium supplied with 10% FBS
(primary-P; the medium to grow the SAS-P and OECM1-P

cells; primary-S, 12.2% vs. primary-P, 4.3%; Fig. 1A). We next
sought to determine whether the ﬂuorescence change were
attributable to be altered by the dye oxidation and not
altered by uptake, ester cleavage, or efﬂux of the probe. As
shown in Supplementary Fig. S2B, these results demonstrated that no signiﬁcant difference of SAS-P and SAS-S cells on
staining of the oxidation-insensitive analog of CarboxyDCFDA as the negative control (Supplementary Fig. S2B;
ref. 21).
Our previous data demonstrate that both memGRP78 and
CD133 could be used as a surface marker for enrichment of
HN-CICs (8, 9). Next, we wanted to determine whether there
was a positive correlation between the lower level of ROS
and the abovementioned CIC surface markers of HN-CICs.
Examined by FACS analyses, the HN-CICs showed elevated
coexpression of either memGRP78 or CD133 with lower level
of ROS in comparison with the parental HNSCCs (Fig. 1C
and D). Furthermore, the expression of Glut3, a recently
identiﬁed cell surface marker of brain tumor stem cells (22),
was also highly correlated with the cells containing low
intracellular ROS amount (Fig. 1E). Finally, it has been
shown that cells harboring higher aldehyde dehydrogenase
(ALDH) activity display the characteristics of CSCs (23).
As expected, the sorted ALDHþ cells also displayed more
low ROS cells than the sorted ALDH cells in HNSCCs
(Fig. 1F). To further clarify the correlation between ALDH
activity and representative CIC markers of cells, SAS sphere
cells or cisplatin-resistant SAS cells (SAS-cisPtR) were selectively double stained with CD133/Glut3 or Grp78/Glut3.
The ALDH activity of the double-stained cells was also
examined by ALDEFLUOR assay. Interestingly, we found
that cell subpopulation positively double stained with
the selected CIC markers (such as the CD133þGlut3þ or
mem
Grp78þGlut3þ subpopulation) also contained the
highest level of ALDH activity in comparison with the
rest individual subpopulations (Supplementary Fig. S1).
The abovementioned observation suggests that the
ALDHþ subpopulation cells mainly overlap with the same
subpopulation of cells that are Grp78þCD133þGlut3þ in
HNSCC cells. Collectively, these results suggest that lower
level of ROS is closely related to cancer stemness properties
in HN-CICs.
Interestingly, we also observed a subpopulation of cells
containing higher level of endogenous ROS in HN-CICs (Fig.
1G). The high ROS level may be reﬂective of an "activated" state
to mimic the proliferative activity of progenitor cells in neural
stem cells (24). Characterization of the ROSHigh cells was
further examined (see text later).
ROSLow cells display CIC properties
To characterize the CIC properties of cells with differential
level of intracellular ROS amount, we stained the HN-CICs with
ROS-indicator dye DCFDA to separate cells into ROSLow,
ROSMedi, and ROSHigh subpopulations followed by ﬂow cytometry (Fig. 2A), and the stemness properties of the three
isolated cell subpopulations were further assessed. Initially,
we observed that the ROSLow cells maintained a spheroidgrowing phenotype; however, both the ROSMedi and ROSHigh

keratinocyte maturation (28). We therefore analyzed cell size of
ROSLow, ROSMedi, and ROSHigh cells by physical parameters
forward and side scatter (FSC, cell size and SSC, cell granularity). As shown in Fig. 3D, the size of ROSLow cells was smaller
than that of ROSMedi and ROSHigh cells.
A low endogenous ROS status of HNSCCs maintains the
quiescent state of CICs
Stem cells are present in a quiescent state but are able to exit
quiescence by ROS activation; in addition, the quiescent state
appears to be necessary for retaining the self-renewal of stem
cells, and is a critical factor in the resistance of CICs to
chemotherapy and targeted therapies (29). Next, we sought
to determine whether the sorted ROSLow cells possess the
abovementioned stem cell perspectives. To assess the quiescent state of cells, we performed cell-cycle analysis by double
staining the cells with proliferative marker Ki-67 and PI for
DNA content. As expected, we found that the sorted ROSLow
cells were present in a relatively quiescent state (Ki-67þ/PIþ,
2.5%), whereas the sorted ROSHigh cells displayed the highest
percentage of proliferative activity (Ki-67þ/PIþ, 49.5%; Fig. 3E).
The above observation was further conﬁrmed by immunobloting with the cell-cycle exit index [BrdUrd (bromodeoxyuridine)
and Ki67]. As shown in Fig. 3F, we discovered that the sphere
cells expressing high oxidative state (yellow arrows) exhibited a
signiﬁcantly higher proliferative activity in comparison with
the cells expressing lower oxidative state (white arrows). We
next sought to determine whether increasing of intracellular
superoxide level by NADPH oxidase activation could trigger
cell-cycle entry of the quiescent ROSLow cells, which were
largely resided in sphere cells? Strikingly, the sphere cells
treated with NADPH oxidase activator H2O2 (30) or arsenic
(31) displayed more adhesive cells but less sphere cells under
microscopic observation (Supplementary Fig. S3B). These data
indicate that the low ROS state is associated with the quiescent
state of stem cells; on the contrary, the high ROS state is
correlated with proliferative activity in HNSCCs.
ROSLow cells show enhanced malignant potentials in
vitro and in vivo
To evaluate the differential malignancy among ROSLow,
ROSMedi, and ROSHigh cells, the in vitro anchorage-independent
growth ability and the in vivo xenografts assay were performed.
The sorted ROSLow cells signiﬁcantly grew larger and more
colonies than the ROSMedi cells and ROSHigh cells did in soft
agar (Fig. 4A). In vivo, the ROSLow cells also showed the best
tumor-initiating ability, being able to form tumor with only 500
inoculated cells, whereas the ROSHigh cells needed at least 1 
104 cells to grow the tumors, which concludes that the ROSLow

Low

cell is 20-fold more tumorigenic than the ROSHigh cells. Nevertheless, the ROSMedi cells did not generate any tumors under
the examined conditions (from 5  102 to 1  104 cells; Fig. 4B
and C).
To further verify the hypothesis that low level of ROS is
pivotal for maintenance of cancer stemness properties and
responsible for tumor growth in nude mice, the stemness
properties within the newly established primary cells derived
from ROSLow- and ROSHigh-generated tumors were further
analyzed, respectively (see Materials and Methods for establishment of primary cells from xenografted tumors). In the
beginning, the newly established primary culture cells derived
from ROSLow-generated tumor formed spheroids promptly.
Empirically, after 3 days of cultivation, the sphere cells became
adherent when the nonserum culture condition was switched
to DMEM medium containing 10% serum (Fig. 4D). However,
we did not observe any spheroid formation from the primary
culture cells, which were derived from tumors generated by
ROSHigh cells. Interestingly, the primary culture cells established from ROSLow-derived tumors kept more ROSLow cells
(11.5%) than the cells established from ROSHigh-derived tumors
did (7.3%; Fig. 4E). In addition, we observed more memGRP78positive cells in primary culture cells established from ROSLow
-derived tumors (10.0%) than the cells established from
ROSHigh-derived tumors (5.5%; Fig. 4F).
Collectively, these results suggest that the sorted ROSLow
cells are more tumorigenic and possess CIC properties in
comparison with the ROSHigh and ROSMedi cells.
HN-CICs are more chemoresistant and cisplatin
treatment enriches the ROSLow cells
To further understand whether HN-CICs are more chemoresistant than the HNSCC cells, we examined the cytotoxic effect
of cisplatin treatment on both HNSCC and sphere cells with
enriched HN-CICs. Being treated with cisplatin for 72 hours,
both the parental SAS and OECM1 cells gave an IC50 value of
around 7.5 mmol/L; however, the SAS sphere cells or
OECM1 sphere cells showed a similar IC50 value of more than
20 mmol/L to the cisplatin treatment (Fig. 5A). Furthermore,
the SAS sphere cells displayed an enhancement of ROSLow cells
in a dose-dependent manner under cisplatin treatment (Fig.
5B). In addition, we found an approximately 4-fold reduction in
the percentage of ROSHigh cells in the cisplatin treatment group
versus the untreated group (Fig. 5C; untreated: 20% vs. cisplatin
treated: 5%), suggesting that ROSHigh cells are relatively chemosensitive in comparison with ROSLow cells, in SAS sphere
cells.
Cancer stem properties are enhanced during the selection of
cisplatin resistance in HNSCC (32). To further evaluate the

ROSlow Cells with CIC Property and Chemoresistance

correlation between low ROS level and cancer stemness properties, we established a cisplatin-resistant HNSCC cell line
(SAS-cisPtR) from SAS cells by progressive cisplatin treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S4; and see details from Materials and
Methods). Obviously, the cell subpopulation with low level of
ROS was signiﬁcantly enhanced in cisplatin-resistant HNSCCs
(SAS-cisPtR; Fig. 5D). It has also been shown that cells harboring higher ALDH activity display the characteristics of CSCs
(23). Therefore, we wanted to understand the relationship
between ALDH activity and cisplatin resistance in HNSCCs.
Empirically, we found that SAS-cisPtR cells increased the
percentage of ALDH-positive (ALDHþ) cells (Fig. 5E).
ROS scavenging and pharmacologic modulation of ROS
level affect the chemosensitivity of HN-CICs
In light of recent ﬁndings that conventional chemotherapy
may not be in sufﬁcient effect, in which the increased expression of ROS defense genes is accompanied within CICs
(16, 33, 34). Given our observations of HN-CICs containing
more ROSLow cells, we proposed that these cells may possess
elevated level of ROS-scavenging enzymes compared with
HNSCCs. Therefore, we compared the expression proﬁle of
ROS scavenger genes of the enriched HN-CICs (from SAS to
OECM1) with that of parental cells (SAS and OECM1) by
Affymetrix microarray analyses. As noticed, the transcripts of
some ROS scavenger genes were upregulated in enriched HNCICs (Fig. 5F and Supplementary Fig. S5). Furthermore, this
Affymetrix microarray analysis showed signiﬁcant increasing
trend of superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), catalase (CAT), and
peroxiredoxin 3 (PRDX3) in the enriched HN-CICs (Fig. 5F).
Both SOD2 and CAT are antioxidant enzymes, and are associated with regulation of cellular ROS and the acquired drug
resistance in cancer (15, 17, 35). Consistent with microarray
results, RT-PCR analyses showed that the expression of SOD2
and CAT transcript was increased in enriched HN-CICs than
that in parental HNSCCs (Fig. 5G). Furthermore, the catalase
enzymatic activity of HNSCC and HN-CICs was measured by
catalase activity assay. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S6, HNCICs exhibited a higher catalase activity as compared with
HNSCC. However, we did not see signiﬁcant difference of the
PRDX3 transcript among the HN-CICs and HNSCCs (Fig. 5G).
We observed that low ROS level was in association with
upregulation of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD2 and CAT
in HN-CICs (Fig. 5G). Next, we aimed to pharmacologically
inhibit or genetically diminish the activity of ROS scavenger
enzymes, then to abrogate the chemoresistance and stemness
properties of CICs. Pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of

SOD2 or catalase, respectively, both reduced the ROSLow subpopulation cells in SAS sphere cells (Fig. 5H; around 8%;
Supplementary Fig. S7A and S8A). In opposite, single cisplatin
treatment enhanced the ROSLow cell subpopulation in HNCICs (Fig. 5H; 22% and Supplementary Fig. S7A). However,
combined treatment with cisplatin plus 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME) or 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3AT) signiﬁcantly lowered the
ROSLow cell subpopulation compared with single treatment
with cisplatin in HN-CICs (Fig. 5H; and Supplementary Fig.
S7A). Furthermore, triple treatment with 2-ME, 3-AT plus
cisplatin showed the most signiﬁcant effect on reducing the
ROSLow cell subpopulation in HN-CICs (Fig. 5H; around 2% and
Supplementary Fig. S7A). Next, we wanted to address whether
SOD2 and/or CAT inhibition in combination with/without
cisplatin treatment would reduce the cell viability in HN-CICs.
As shown in Fig. 6A, the cell viability of CICs singly or combinatorially treated with 2-ME, 3-AT, and/or cisplatin was analyzed by MTT assay. Along with the reduction of ROSLow cell
subpopulation in HN-CICs under triple treatment of 2-ME,
3-AT plus cisplatin (Fig. 5H), we also observed that the cell
viability of the triple-treated HN-CICs was the most signiﬁcantly
diminished (left with around 35%) by MTT assay (Fig. 6A).
Finally, to further examine whether pharmacologic modulation of ROS levels contributed to cell death in HN-CICs, SAS
sphere cells were singly or combinatorially treated with 2-ME,
3-AT, or cisplatin. The treated cells undergoing cell death was
determined by costained with Annexin V and PI and examined
by ﬂow cytometry. Single treatment of 2-ME or 3-AT caused a
slight increase in cell death of HN-CICs. In addition, combined
treatment with 2-ME or 3-AT sensitized the cytotoxicity of
cisplatin treatment in HN-CICs. Moreover, triple treatment
with 2-ME and 3-AT plus cisplatin was the most effective and
induced around 45% of the cell population undergoing cell
death (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Fig. S7B). Together, these
data demonstrate the importance of antioxidant defense to
maintain the low ROS level, cell viability, and chemosensitivity
of HN-CICs
Antioxidant ability is required to maintain the stemness
properties and malignancy of HN-CICs
To further evaluate whether the antioxidant ability is important to sustain the stemness properties of HN-CICs, the SAS
sphere cells were treated with 2-ME, 3-AT, or cisplatin alone or
in combination. As shown in Fig. 6C, the sphere cell singly
treated with 2-ME or 3-AT displayed decreased expression of
"cancer stemness" proteins (Oct-4 and Nanog). In opposite, we
observed that sphere cell singly treated with cisplatin showed

ROSlow Cells with CIC Property and Chemoresistance

higher protein levels of Oct-4 and Nanog but did not affect the
expression of epithelial differentiation marker, cytokeratin 18
(CK-18) and Involucrin (Fig. 6C–E and Supplementary Fig.
S7C). However, pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of SOD2
or catalase caused the increase of CK18þ subpopulation cells
but the decreased expression of CIC marker CD44 in HN-CICs
(Fig. 6D, Supplementary Fig. S8B and S8C). In addition, the
sphere/anchorage-independent colony formation abilities of
HN-CICs under genetic inhibition of SOD2 or catalase were
also signiﬁcantly abolished (Supplementary Fig. S8D and S8E).
Interestingly, HN-CICs undergoing pharmacologic or genetic
inhibition of catalase rather than inhibition of SOD2 displayed
a more potent efﬁciency to cause the cell differentiation (Fig.
6D; 3-AT, 40%; 2-ME, 20%; Fig. 6E and Supplementary Fig. S8B).
Nevertheless, the triple treatment of 3-AT, 2-ME plus cisplatin
showed the most potential to enhance the CK18-positive cells
(Fig. 6D; around 56% and Fig. 6E). In the mean times, triple
treatment of 3-AT, 2-ME plus cisplatin signiﬁcantly inhibited
the sphere formation ability of HN-CICs, whereas relatively
larger size spheres were observed from single cisplatin-treated
HN-CICs (Fig. 6F).
We next sought to determine whether inhibition of the
activity of ROS scavenger enzymes could attenuate the
malignancy of HN-CICs both in vitro and in vivo. As shown
in Fig. 6G, the anchorage-independent growth abilities of
SAS sphere cells under triple treatment were signiﬁcantly
abolished. In addition, triple treatment of 3-AT, 2-ME plus
cisplatin to SAS sphere cells or SAS-cisPtR cells signiﬁcantly
reduced the tumor volumes by xenograft transplantation
assay (Fig. 6H and I). Overall, combined treatment with 2-ME
and 3-AT reduced the self-renewal ability of HN-CICs, and
sensitized the in vitro cytotoxicity mediated by cisplatin
treatment on HN-CICs.
Catalase has been reported to be highly correlated with
tumor malignant grade (36). We therefore proceeded to evaluate whether overexpression of catalase could enhance stemness properties. Treatment of SAS sphere cells with PEG-CAT
displayed not only elevated expression of catalase activity but
also the increased percentage of ROSLow cells (Supplementary
Fig. S9A and S9B). Furthermore, we demonstrated that catalase
overexpression also resulted in increased expression of CIC
markers (memGrp78, CD44, and ALDH activity). (Supplementary Figs. S9C, S9D, and S10A). To further understand whether
treatment of cisplatin, 3-AT or 2-ME can cause signiﬁcant
cytotoxicity to normal stem cells, the hematopoietic stem cells

(HSC) were ﬁrst treated with the above drugs and subjected to
MTT assay, respectively. We observed that single treatment of
cisplatin or 2-ME decreased the cell viability of HSC cells.
However, there was no signiﬁcant inhibition of cell viability on
3-AT–treated HSC cells (Supplementary Fig. S11).

Discussion
Patients with HNSCC are still very likely to relapse within
months after therapy (37) that may be because conventional
treatments cannot efﬁciently eliminate CICs, which are
involved in the tumor progression, metastasis, and chemo/
radio resistance (2). Most of the anticancer drugs kill cancer
cells by induced ROS generation, but prolonged treatment with
the drugs results in reduced ROS level as a result of therapy
resistance (38, 39). Caraglia and colleagues (40) provide evidence that the determination of oxidative stress status could
be a marker of drug efﬁcacy in patients with cancer. Thus, we
hypothesized CICs are resistant to therapies due to their lower
intracellular ROS content compared with the differentiated
cancer cells. Moreover, understanding the relationships
between ROS and drug resistance of CICs is important to
improving the efﬁcacy for future chemotherapies.
In the present study, we show that HN-CICs contain lower
concentrations of ROS than parental cancer cells. Consequently, cell subpopulations, including ROSLow, ROSMedi, and
ROSHigh with differential ROS level, were isolated. Notably,
ROSLow cancer cells are closely associated with CD133,
mem
Grp78, Glut3, and ALDHþ cells (Fig. 1). We observed that
the ROSLow cells displayed a sphere-growing phenotype; in
contrast, both the ROSMedi and ROSHigh cells grew as an
adherent phenotype under the same culture condition (Fig.
2). Furthermore, ROSLow HN-CIC cells displayed CIC properties
in comparison with ROSMedi and ROSHigh subpopulation cells.
Furthermore, cell-cycle studies indicated that ROSLow cells
existed in lower Ki-67 activity (Fig. 3). Importantly, an in vivo
nude mice model demonstrates that ROSLow population possessed high tumorigenic potential (Fig. 4). In addition, HNCICs seem able to regulate ROS to exhibit chemoresistance by
increasing production of antioxidant genes (Fig. 5). Pharmacologic depletion of ROS scavengers in CICs reduced their
clonogenicity and resulted in chemosensitization to cisplatin
both in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 6). Collectively, our data ﬁrst
demonstrated the crucial role of low ROS level for the tumorigenicity and chemoresistance of HN-CICs. In addition, distinct

Chemoresistance

subpopulation of cells with differential intracellular ROS level
in HNSCC exhibit diverse proliferative activity, CIC properties
and chemoresistance.
Cells containing ROS-mediated high chemically reactive
byproducts are implicated in stress and disease (41). Increasing
evidence suggests that low levels of ROS are critical for maintaining the self-renewal and stemness, whereas high levels of
ROS effectively shut down self-renewal and confer potent
capacity for stem cell differentiation (12, 42). In addition, CICs
have similar redox properties as normal stem cell (43). Diehn
and colleagues FoxO1 (16) have reported that CD44þCD24
breast CICs have a unique mechanism that protects themselves from ROS through increased antioxidant defenses and
unique redox-dependent effects on tumor radioresistance.
They also found that the breast CIC-enriched population is
associated with genes involved in glutathione synthesis,

including Gclm, Gss, and FoxO1. For glioblastoma, it has been
reported that glioblastoma stem cells are assumed to constitute a radio-resistant fraction by HIF2a-mediated ROS status
(33, 44). However, a relationship between ROS and chemoresistance property in HN-CICs remains elusive. In the present
study, we demonstrated that lower ROS levels in HN-CIC–
enriched population are associated with increased expression
of ROS scavenger such as catalase and SOD2. Pharmacologic
depletion of ROS scavengers (SOD2 and/or catalase) in CICs
markedly enhanced the cytotoxicity of cisplatin (Fig. 6). Notably, it is evident that catalase and SOD2 has been implicated in
chemotherapy resistance of cancer cells (15, 45). On the basis of
these ﬁndings, we proposed that different CSCs in diverse
antioxidant systems have conserved this attribute, which
probably helps protect their genomes from ROS-mediated
damage. Previous studies also show that signaling molecules

suspension of SAS sphere cells was treated with cisplatin or cotreated with ROS scavenger inhibitors (2-ME and/or 3-AT) for 72 hours, and the sphere

such as FoxOs, APE1/Ref-1, Nrf2, ATM, HIFs, p38, and p53 are
involved in the regulation of stem cell self-renewal and differentiation through modulation in antioxidant enzyme systems
(11). Therefore, future research delineating the details of what
ROS signaling molecules are essential to maintaining stemness
properties of CICs in these different cell types are remained to
be determined.
CICs in colon, breast, and ovaries have been shown to
demonstrate the ability to maintain a quiescent state to evade
therapy (46–48). In addition, Dey-Guha and colleagues (49)
report that rapidly proliferating cancer cells can produce "G0like" progeny through asymmetric division, which are enriched
following chemotherapy in breast cancer. These G0 phase cells
show lower intracellular ROS level and exhibit suppressing
AKT expression. Herein, we also found that low endogenous
ROS status of HNSCCs maintains the quiescent state of CICs.
Surprisingly, we observed ROSHigh cells exhibit the high proliferation index (Fig. 3E and F). Recently, many reports demonstrate that higher ROS state is essential for proliferation of
stem/progenitor cells (14, 50). For example, ROS can play roles
as second messengers in tightly neural stem cell proliferation
and survival by driving PI3K/AKT signaling (24). In addition, it
is evident that ROS generation is essential for K-ras–mediated
cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in lung cancer (51). On the
basis of these ﬁndings, we proposed that CIC-enriched populations are partially differentiated due to persistent ROS redox
stress on the basis of tumor microenvironment changes, which
lead to a heterogeneous mixture of CICs and non-CICs in the
tumor. It would be of interest to determine the regulations of
these signaling pathways of ROSLow and ROSHigh HN-CICs,
respectively. These studies also suggest that combination of
inhibitors for ROSLow and ROSHigh regulator of the signaling
pathway might be more effective compared with blockade of
single regulating HN-CICs.
Most conventional anticancer drugs such as cisplatin and 5ﬂuorouracil are preferentially toxic to proliferating cells,
decreases tumor size (52). Herein, we have also conﬁrmed
that long-term treatment of cisplatin can enhance the ROSLow
cells of CIC properties, and make them prone to survive (Fig. 5D
and E). Furthermore, combinatorial treatment of scavenger
inhibitors for ROSLow and conventional anticancer drugs
reduced the self-renewal ability and survival in HN-CICs (Fig.

5 and 6). In the mean times, it is effective to target the
proliferative ROSHigh cells by long-term treatment of cisplatin
(Fig. 5C). Therefore, it will be reasonable that cotreatment with
an ROSLow inhibitor along with an ROSHigh inhibitor as a
chemotherapeutic regimen may improve the future treatment
of HNSCCs.
Together, this research shows that HN-CICs contain distinct
subpopulation cells, and the elevated ROSLow cells in HN-CICs
mainly contribute to tumor progression and chemoresistance
(Fig. 7). Clinical therapies could perhaps be optimized by
overcoming low ROS levels, and identiﬁcation of regulatory
ROS level mechanisms in CICs may be a useful prognostic
factor for patients with HNSCC.
