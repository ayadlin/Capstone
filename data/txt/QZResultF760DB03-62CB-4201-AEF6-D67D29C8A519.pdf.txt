Abstract
Agents, such as b-lapachone, that target the redox enzyme, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), to
induce programmed necrosis in solid tumors have shown great promise, but more potent tumor-selective
compounds are needed. Here, we report that deoxynyboquinone kills a wide spectrum of cancer cells in an NQO1dependent manner with greater potency than b-lapachone. Deoxynyboquinone lethality relies on NQO1dependent futile redox cycling that consumes oxygen and generates extensive reactive oxygen species (ROS).
Elevated ROS levels cause extensive DNA lesions, PARP1 hyperactivation, and severe NADþ/ATP depletion that
stimulate Ca2þ–dependent programmed necrosis, unique to this new class of NQO1 "bioactivated" drugs. Shortterm exposure of NQO1þ cells to deoxynyboquinone was sufﬁcient to trigger cell death, although genetically
matched NQO1 cells were unaffected. Moreover, siRNA-mediated NQO1 or PARP1 knockdown spared NQO1þ
cells from short-term lethality. Pretreatment of cells with BAPTA-AM (a cytosolic Ca2þ chelator) or catalase
(enzymatic H2O2 scavenger) was sufﬁcient to rescue deoxynyboquinone-induced lethality, as noted with
b-lapachone. Investigations in vivo showed equivalent antitumor efﬁcacy of deoxynyboquinone to b-lapachone,
but at a 6-fold greater potency. PARP1 hyperactivation and dramatic ATP loss were noted in the tumor, but not
in the associated normal lung tissue. Our ﬁndings offer preclinical proof-of-concept for deoxynyboquinone as a
potent chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of a wide spectrum of therapeutically challenging solid tumors,
such as pancreatic and lung cancers. Cancer Res; 72(12); 3038–47. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Lack of selectivity of most cancer chemotherapeutics remains a major limiting factor (1). We have focused on exploiting elevated NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1, EC
1.6.99.2) levels in most solid tumors, particularly in non–small
cell lung (NSCLC), prostate, pancreatic, and breast (2–4),
for drug development. NQO1 is an inducible phase II detoxifying 2-electron oxidoreductase capable of reducing most quinones, forming stable hydroquinones. Glutathione S-transferase

then detoxiﬁes hydroquinones, conjugating them with glutathione for secretion (5).
Certain rare compounds, however, may undergo NQO1mediated bioreduction for antitumor activity. Rather than
detoxifying, NQO1 converts speciﬁc quinones into highly cytotoxic species. Most antitumor quinones dependent on NQO1
are DNA alkylators: mitomycin C (6, 7), RH1 (8), E09 (7), and
AZQ (9). Use of these agents is limited because they are subject
to detoxiﬁcation pathways, efﬁcient substrates for ubiquitously expressed one-electron oxidoreductases that cause normal
tissue toxicity, and subject to emergent drug resistance from
various DNA repair pathways.
b-Lapachone (Fig. 1A) kills cancer cells and murine xenograft
and orthotopic human or mouse tumor models in vivo in
an NQO1-dependent manner (3, 10). b-Lapachone induces
cell death by NQO1-dependent reactive oxygen species
(ROS) formation and oxidative stress (2–4). NQO1 metabolizes
b-lapachone into an unstable hydroquinone that spontaneously
oxidizes, by 2 dioxygen equivalents, generating superoxide
(10, 11). Elevated long-lived hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) causes
extensive DNA base and single-strand break (SSB) lesions that
are normally easily and rapidly repaired. However, extensive
NQO1-dependent SSBs cause poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1
(PARP1) hyperactivation, inhibiting the essential base and SSB
repair functions. PARP1 hyperactivation causes dramatic
NADþ/ATP pool losses due to ADP ribosylation, resulting in
extensive energy depletion and cell death (2–4). Thus,

b-lapachone kills NQO1þ cancer cells by programmed necrosis
that is independent of caspase activation or p53 status, independent of bcl-2 levels, not affected by BAX/BAK deﬁciencies,
independent of EGF receptor, Ras, or other constitutive signal
transduction activation, and/or not dependent on proliferation.
b-Lapachone is, therefore, an attractive experimental drug, and
various b-lapachone formulations have been, or are in, phase I/II
clinical trials.
However, b-lapachone has a modest potency (LD50: 2–
10 mmol/L) in vitro, with limited aqueous solubility that
complicates formulation and delivery. Although nanoparticle
strategies for b-lapachone delivery solved formulation issues,
resulting in dramatic antitumor efﬁcacy (12), there is a clear
need for higher potency drugs.
Deoxynyboquinone (Fig. 1A) is a promising antineoplastic
agent whose mechanism of action has not been elucidated.
Deoxynyboquinone killed cancer cells through oxidative stress
and ROS formation (13, 14), and N-acetyl cysteine, a global free
radical scavenger (13), partially blocked lethality. Here, we

show that deoxynyboquinone undergoes an NQO1-dependent
futile cycle similar to b-lapachone, in which O2 is consumed,
ROS is formed, and extensive DNA damage triggers PARP1
hyperactivation. Dramatic NADþ/ATP pool decreases caused
programmed necrosis. Deoxynyboquinone is 20- to 100-fold
more potent than b-lapachone, with a signiﬁcantly enhanced
therapeutic window in human breast, prostate, and pancreatic
cancer models in vitro. NQO1 processes deoxynyboquinone
in vitro more efﬁciently than b-lapachone, suggesting that
increased usage accounts for its enhanced potency. Signiﬁcant
efﬁcacy of deoxynyboquinone at 6-fold greater potency versus
b-lapachone against orthotopic Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) is
shown.

dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Dihydroethidium
(DHE, 5 mmol/L in DMSO) was purchased from Invitrogen
Life Technologies. RH1 and a-human NQO1 antibody were
provided by Dr. David Ross (University of Colorado Health
Science Center, Denver, CO) and used at a 1:5,000 dilution
overnight, 4 C. a-PAR (BD Pharmingen), which detects poly
(ADP-ribosyl)ated (PAR) proteins (typically ADP-ribosylated
PARP1), and a-PARP1 (sc-8007, Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
antibodies were used at 1:4,000 and 1:2,000 dilutions, respectively. a-Tubulin was monitored for loading (15).
NQO1 enzyme assays
Deoxynyboquinone, b-lapachone, or other quinones (see
Supplementary Fig. S1 for structures) were monitored as NQO1
substrates using an NADH (400 mmol/L) recycling assay and
recombinant NQO1 (Sigma; ref. 10), in which NADH oxidation to
NADþ was monitored by absorbance (A340 nm) and data
recorded at 2 second intervals for 5 minutes. NADH oxidation
rates were compared with reactions lacking b-lapachone or
deoxynyboquinone, or containing dicoumarol (10 mmol/L).
Initial velocities were calculated and data expressed as dicoumarol-inhibited relative units (mmol NADH oxidized/min/mmol
protein; ref. 10).
O2 consumption rates
Assays were carried out using Seahorse 24-well dishes in
conjunction with an XF24 sensor cartridge and a XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Brieﬂy, 30,000 cells per well were
seeded using a 2-step process, and cells grown as above with
unseeded background correction wells. O2 consumption rates
(OCR) and proton production rates were measured using
the XF24 Analyzer and Assay Wizard software. Data represent means, %treated/control (T/C,%) SE from quadruplet
assessments.
Nucleotide analyses
Changes in intracellular NADþ pools were measured using
Fluorescent NAD/NADH Detection Kits (Cell Technology, Inc.;
ref. 2). NADþ/NADH levels were graphed as means, SE from
at least 3 independent experiments carried out in sextuplets
each. Changes in ATP in vivo were measured as described (2–4)
and using a colorimetric/ﬂuorometric assay (BioVision).
Immunoblotting, ROS formation
Western blots were carried out as described (3). ROS (superoxide) formation was monitored by DHE staining and microscopy. Quantitative data were analyzed using NIH ImageJ
software, in which data are means, SE of 100 cells and
duplicate experiments conducted in triplicate.
PAR formation
PAR formation in vivo was assessed by Western blotting
controlled for a-tubulin (2–4). Chemiluminescence ELISA
assays, to quantify PAR formation, were carried out by HT
PARP in vivo Pharmacodynamic II Assays (Trevigen, Inc.).

in triplicate.
Cell lines and culture
Endogenous NQO1 overexpressing human A549 NSCLC,
MCF-7 breast, MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic, PC-3 prostate, and
HT1080 sarcoma cancer cells were obtained (3, 4, 16), MAP
tested and DNA ﬁngerprinted (ATC). NQO1  2 polymorphic
human H596 NSCLC or MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast,
and genetically matched NQO1þ, cancer cells were generated by us (2, 4). NQO1þ human PC-3 and genetically
matched stable lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-NQO1
knockdown, prostate cancer cells were generated by us (16).
Cancer cells were grown in DMEM with 5% FBS. MDA-MB231 cells were grown in RPMI 1640. Cells were cultured at
37 C in a 5% CO2 95% air humidiﬁed atmosphere and were
Mycoplasma free.
PARP1 siRNA knockdown
siRNA speciﬁc to the open reading frame of PARP1, 50 CCAAAGGAATTCCGAGAAA-30 (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc)

Relative survival assays were assessed as described (3) and
correlated well with colony forming assays (15). Results were
reported as means, SE from sextuplate repeats. Experiments
were independently repeated 3 times.
Hepatocyte metabolic stability and pharmacokinetic
assessments
During initial maximum-tolerated dose evaluations for
deoxynyboquinone (10 mg/kg), pharmacokinetics for deoxynyboquinone was assessed and compared with prior b-lapachone (30 mg/kg) pharmacokinetic data (12) as described in
Supplementary Material and Methods. The metabolic stability
of deoxynyboquinone versus b-lapachone was examined in a
standard in vitro hepatocyte assay (Supplementary Materials

Results
Deoxynyboquinone kills cancer cells in an NQO1dependent manner
We examined the lethality of deoxynyboquinone with or
without dicoumarol, an NQO1 inhibitor, using 2 cancer cell
lines, MCF-7 (breast) and A549 (NSCLC), that endogenously
express elevated NQO1 levels (Fig. 1). Deoxynyboquinoneinduced lethality was compared with b-lapachone and menadione (Fig. 1A); dicoumarol prevented b-lapachone, but
potentiated menadione lethality in NQO1þ cells (10, 17). Dicoumarol spared deoxynyboquinone lethality in both cells (Fig.
1B). However, deoxynyboquinone was approximately 20-fold
more potent than b-lapachone (compare Fig. 1B and C). As
with b-lapachone (5 mmol/L), a minimum 2-hour exposure of
A549 cells to deoxynyboquinone (0.25 mmol/L) was required for
complete lethality (Supplementary Fig. S2A) and extensive
DNA base damage and SSBs (Supplementary Fig. S2B). This
dose was used in all subsequent studies.
Deoxynyboquinone was processed in vitro at a signiﬁcantly
increased rate relative to b-lapachone, or other quinones
(streptonigrin, menadione, RH1, and mitomycin C). At
1 mmol/L, deoxynyboquinone was reduced by NQO1 approximately 13-fold more efﬁciently than other quinones (Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Fig. S1). Importantly, at
LD100 levels (0.25 mmol/L for deoxynyboquinone, 5 mmol/L for
b-lapachone) in A549 cells, the NQO1 NADH recycling activities in vitro using deoxynyboquinone or b-lapachone were
essentially identical (Supplementary Table S2), suggesting
that the catalytic efﬁciency of NQO1 for deoxynyboquinone
was at least 20-fold greater than for b-lapachone. Menadione
was a signiﬁcantly (>20-fold) less efﬁcient substrate in vitro
for NQO1 at its LD90, as reported (10). Dicoumarol potentiated menadione lethality in MCF-7 cells, but not in A549 cells
(Fig. 1D).

Deoxynyboquinone efﬁciently kills a wide spectrum of
cancer cells in an NQO1-dependent manner
Deoxynyboquinone efﬁciently killed human MIA PaCa-2
pancreatic (Fig. 2A) and HT1080 sarcoma cancer cells (Fig.
2B) with LD50 values of 48 and 178 nmol/L, respectively;
deoxynyboquinone showed greater potency in pancreatic cells,
in general. Dicoumarol protected both cells. We then treated
genetically matched NQO1þ versus NQO1 human H596
NSCLC or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with deoxynyboquinone;  2 NQO1 polymorphic H596 and MDA-MB-231 cells
were separately corrected for NQO1 expression as clones or
pooled populations (4, 10). Deoxynyboquinone killed all
NQO1þ clones and pooled populations, but not genetically
matched NQO1 cells (Fig. 2C and D). Similarly, human PC-3
cells stably knocked down for NQO1 expression (shNQ) were
spared versus NQO1þ PC-3 cells expressing nonsilencing
shRNA (Fig. 2E). Deoxynyboquinone-induced cytotoxicity in
nonsilenced NQO1þ PC-3 cells was prevented by dicoumarol
(Fig. 2E), as in parental PC-3 cells. PC-3 cells treated with
dicoumarol were similarly spared from deoxynyboquinone
lethality as were stable NQO1 knockdown shNQ PC-3 cells
(Fig. 2E). Colony forming assays conﬁrmed the NQO1 dependency of deoxynyboquinone (Fig. 2F). LD50 values for deoxynyboquinone versus b-lapachone cytotoxicities in various
cancers are listed in Supplementary Table S3, highlighting the
NQO1-dependent potency of deoxynyboquinone.
Deoxynyboquinone NQO1-dependent lethality involves a
futile cycle generating ROS
b-Lapachone-induced lethality involves a futile cycle mediated by NQO1, in which approximately 60 moles of NAD(P)H
are used, forming approximately 120 moles superoxide (O2)
per mole b-lapachone in 2 minutes (10). We compared OCR in
A549 NSCLC cells after deoxynyboquinone versus b-lapachone
treatments. As with b-lapachone (Fig. 3A), deoxynyboquinonetreated A549 cells (Fig. 3B) showed dramatic OCR increases
that were dose dependent and reached peak levels in 30
minutes at LD50 levels (Fig. 3C and D). Minimal differences
between b-lapachone and deoxynyboquinone were noted,
except that signiﬁcantly lower deoxynyboquinone doses were
needed (Fig. 3B). Dicoumarol blocked OCR from either deoxynyboquinone- or b-lapachone-treated cells, strongly suggesting that O2 consumption was NQO1 mediated. Similar OCR
increases were noted in NQO1þ, but not in NQO1, H596 cells
(Supplementary Fig. 3A and B). Low, but detectable, O2 consumption in NQO1þ A549 cells after cotreatment of b-lapachone and dicoumarol (Fig. 3A and C) may be due to oneelectron oxidoreductases (b5R and p450R) metabolizing
b-lapachone. Interestingly, such OCRs with dicoumarol were
not noted with deoxynyboquinone, suggesting that deoxynyboquinone was not as good a substrate for one-electron
oxidoreductases (Fig. 3B and D).
We then monitored superoxide (O2) formation using DHE
staining. Deoxynyboquinone (0.25 mmol/L) induced dramatic
ROS formation in 60 minutes in A549 cells that was prevented
by dicoumarol (Fig. 3E). Exogenous catalase (CAT, 1,000 U)
partially rescued deoxynyboquinone cytotoxicity (Fig. 3F).
Thus, NQO1-dependent deoxynyboquinone metabolism

resulted in extensive OCR, O2 formation, and long-lived H2O2
production similar to b-lapachone (2), but at 20-fold lower
concentrations.
Deoxynyboquinone induces PARP1 hyperactivation, loss
of essential nucleotides
Deoxynyboquinone-treated A549 cells were examined for
poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated protein (PAR) formation using an ELISA
method, in which peak levels were noted at approximately 10
minutes (Fig. 4A). PAR-PARP1 (PAR) formation was conﬁrmed
by Western blot analyses with similar kinetics, lasting approximately 20 minutes (Fig. 4B). Dicoumarol effectively suppressed PAR formation and blocked PARP1 hyperactivation
in deoxynyboquinone-treated A549 cells (Fig. 4A). PARP1
hyperactivation induced by deoxynyboquinone in A549 cells
was accompanied by dramatic NADþ and ATP losses. Both
dose–response and time–course studies showed that NADþ
and ATP were rapidly and extensively depleted (Figs. 4C–F),
and a 2-hour exposure was sufﬁcient for near complete NADþ
loss in deoxynyboquinone-exposed cells (0.25 mmol/L, 2
hours, Fig. 4C and E). Dramatic ATP loss followed NADþ
depletion in both dose- and time-dependent manners
(Fig. 4D and F) that were prevented by dicoumarol. Deoxynyboquinone-induced ATP losses occurred in an NQO1-depen-

dent manner in NQO1þ, but not in NQO1, H596 cells (Supplementary Fig. 4A and B).
Both PARP1 and Ca2þ play pivotal roles in
deoxynyboquinone-induced cell death
We then transiently knocked down PARP1 using speciﬁc
siRNA, which did not affect NQO1 expression (Fig. 5A). PARP1
knockdown signiﬁcantly prevented NADþ (Fig. 5B) and ATP
losses (Supplementary Fig. S5) in deoxynyboquinone-exposed
A549 cells versus parental or nontargeting siRNA-treated
(siNT) cells. Transient PARP1 knockdown signiﬁcantly
decreased programmed necrosis (TUNELþ) 24 hours after
treatment with either LD50 (0.125 mmol/L) or lethal (0.25
mmol/L) deoxynyboquinone doses (Fig. 5C and D), similar to
effects noted with b-lapachone (2). Dicoumarol spared parental and PARP1 knockdown cells (Fig. 5D).
PARP1 hyperactivation required endoplasmic reticulum
Ca2þ release as BAPTA-AM, an endogenous cytosolic Ca2þ
chelator, spared b-lapachone-induced lethality (2). BAPTA-AM
pretreatment signiﬁcantly spared deoxynyboquinone-induced
lethality in NQO1þ A549 or H596 NSCLC cells using long-term
survival assays (Fig. 5E, Supplementary Fig. S6), and signiﬁcantly suppressed PARP1 hyperactivation, noted by abrogation
of NADþ depletion (no addition vs. BAPTA-AM, Fig. 5F).

predicted its antitumor efﬁcacy in vivo (3, 16). A549 cells were
exposed to various deoxynyboquinone doses, with or without
dicoumarol (40 mmol/L), at various times to assess the longterm survival "potential therapeutic window," as done with
b-lapachone in NSCLC, pancreatic, and prostate cancers
(3, 12, 16). In A549 cells, deoxynyboquinone exhibited a much
broader therapeutic window than b-lapachone (compare
Figs. 6A–J to those in ref. 4). Deoxynyboquinone-treated
(0.25 mmol/L) A549 cells were rescued by dicoumarol (Fig.
6A–H). However, as the length of deoxynyboquinone exposure
was increased to more than 24 hours, only approximately 70%
of the cells were spared by dicoumarol (Fig. 6I). Lethality was
further increased after more than 48 hours of deoxynyboquinone exposure in cells treated with dicoumarol (Fig. 6J),
with limited lethality increases in parental NQO1þ cells (compare solid square lines at 2 vs. 24 hours, Fig. 6C and H,

respectively). Similar responses were noted in NQO1þ vs.
NQO1 H596 cells (Supplementary Fig. S7A–C).
Deoxynyboquinone antitumor efﬁcacy
Using an extremely aggressive orthotopic LLC model in
athymic mice, we examined the antitumor efﬁcacy of deoxynyboquinone (Fig. 7); murine LLC tumors have approximately
80 U of NQO1 activity versus less than 100 U in mouse normal
lungs. Mice were treated every other day for 5 injections with
HPbCD alone, deoxynyboquinone (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg) or
b-lapachone (30 mg/kg). Later (18 days), lungs were removed,
weighed, and visually scored for tumor nodules (Fig. 7A and B).
DNQ-HPbCD (5 and 10 mg/kg) or b-Lap-HPbCD–treated mice
showed signiﬁcant tumor growth reductions, conﬁrmed by
decreases in tumor nodule formation and histology (Fig. 7A
and B). No long-term pathologic effects (monitored 18 days
after one regimen) of deoxynyboquinone or b-lapachone were
noted in liver (Fig. 7C), lung, bone marrow, spleen, or thymus;
unlike humans, mice have relatively high liver NQO1 levels.
Overall survival conﬁrmed signiﬁcant antitumor efﬁcacy of
deoxynyboquinone (at 5 mg/kg; P  0.04), at a 6-fold lower dose

than b-lapachone (30 mg/kg; Fig. 7D). Finally, PAR formation
and energy (ATP) losses in LLC tumors after deoxynyboquinone or b-lapachone exposures conﬁrmed their PARP1 hyperactivation-mediated programmed necrotic mechanism (Fig.
7E and F); tumor-speciﬁc ATP losses were conﬁrmed by LC/
MS/MS analyses. In contrast, associated normal lung tissue
was unaffected, showing no PARP1 hyperactivation or ATP loss
(Fig. 7E and F).
Metabolic stability measurements using murine hepatocytes and plasma pharmacokinetic analyses revealed greater
metabolic stability and prolonged plasma half-life of deoxynyboquinone versus b-lapachone (Supplementary Fig. S8A and
B and Supplementary Table S4).

Discussion
Identifying exploitable differences between cancerous and
healthy tissue is critical for development of next-generation
cancer treatments. NQO1 is overexpressed in a majority of solid
tumors, in angiogenic and bone marrow endothelial cells (18,
19), and is induced by exposure to certain quinones (20) or
ionizing radiation (21, 22). NQO1 overexpression in solid tumor

3044

Cancer Res; 72(12) June 15, 2012

versus associated normal tissue was reported in approximately
80% NSCLC tumors at 20- to 40-fold (4), approximately 70%
breast tumors at 10- to 20-fold (23), approximately 90% pancreatic tumors at 20- to 30-fold (24), approximately 60%
prostate tumors at 10- to 20-fold (3), and approximately
60% colon tumors at 5- to 10-fold (25). Thus, compounds
"bioactivated" by NQO1 have potential for "personalized" anticancer therapy.
b-Lapachone and deoxynyboquinone kill cancer cells through
the same NQO1-dependent programmed necrotic (necroptosis)
pathway. At minimally lethal doses of each agent (0.25 mmol/L
for deoxynyboquinone, 5 mmol/L for b-lapachone), a minimum
exposure time (2 hours) was noted for 100% lethality in vitro;
H2O2 was the apparent obligatory ROS intermediate required
for PARP1 hyperactivation and lethality, as catalase prevented
both; Ca2þ release (2, 26) for PARP1 hyperactivation and lethality was required, as BAPTA-AM prevented both; PARP1 hyperactivation caused dramatic ATP and NADþ losses; and cells
were killed in the same time frame and with unique proteolysis (e.g., atypical PARP1 and p53 cleavage). Understanding this
mechanism will lead to further improvement in their efﬁcacy.

PARP1 Hyperactivation Mediates Tumor-Speciﬁc DNQ Killing

The potency and NQO1-dependent therapeutic window
(Fig. 6) of deoxynyboquinone and its apparent reduced metabolism by one-electron oxidoreductases, make this drug
(or derivatives) very promising. We elucidated its mechanism
of action in various cancer cells, showing that it induced
programmed necrosis identical to b-lapachone, but with
approximately 20-fold increased potency. NQO1þ cells were
selectively hypersensitive to deoxynyboquinone, whereas
genetically matched NQO1 cells were resistant. NQO1þ cells
were rescued from deoxynyboquinone-induced cytotoxicity by
NQO1 knockdown or by chemical inhibition (via DIC) of NQO1.
Exposure of NQO1þ cancer cells to deoxynyboquinone elicited
elevated superoxide levels, with concomitant and signiﬁcant
OCR. Downstream, deoxynyboquinone stimulated PARP1

Figure 6. Deoxynyboquinone shows a broad NQO1-dependent
therapeutic window. Relative survival was monitored in A549 cells
treated with various deoxynyboquinone concentrations (mmol/L) 
dicoumarol (40 mmol/L) for 30 minutes (A), 1 hour (B), 2 hours (C),
4 hours (D), 6 hours (E), 8 hours (F), 12 hours (G), 24 hours (H), 48 hours
(I), and 72 hours (J). Graphed are means, SE of duplicate
experiments, repeated in sextuplets. DNQ, deoxynyboquinone.

(siPARP1) or nontargeted siRNA (siNT) cells 48 hours posttransfection.
Loading was monitored by a-tubulin levels. B, PARP1 is essential for NADþ

mmol/L) NQO1þ A549 cells. P values compare NADþ levels in PARP1
knockdown versus parental or siNT A549 cells. C, micrographs of

hyperactivation in a mechanism essentially identical to b-lapachone, which correlated well with NADþ/ATP losses, and
NADH recycling assays conﬁrmed futile cycling of deoxynyboquinone by NQO1.
Deoxynyboquinone has an apparently broader NQO1-dependent therapeutic window in vitro (Fig. 6) than b-lapachone (4)
using A549 cells as a surrogate. Similar data were obtained using
NQO1þ versus NQO1 H596 cells (Supplementary Fig. S7). Thus,
deoxynyboquinone may not be as good a substrate as b-lapachone for p450R and b5R, as b-lapachone-treated cells consumed low, but detectable O2 even with DIC, whereas OCR was
blocked in deoxynyboquinone-treated cells (Figs. 3C and D).
Antitumor (Fig. 7), pharmacokinetic and metabolic stability
(Supplementary Material, Table S4 and Supplementary Fig.
S8A and B) data support a strong antitumor efﬁcacy potential
for deoxynyboquinone, with increased metabolic stability in
intact hepatocytes in vitro and a longer half-life than b-lapachone. The increased metabolic stability of deoxynyboquinone

Figure 7. Deoxynyboquinone shows equivalent efﬁcacy to b-lapachone at a 6-fold lower dose. In A–C, mice bearing visible tumors were treated
once every other day for 5 injections as in the text, and average wet weight tumor volumes assessed (A and B). Tumor nodules were conﬁrmed
visually (A) and histologically (not shown), and average wet weights calculated (B). DNQ-HPbCD (5 or 10 mg/kg) or b-Lap-HPbCD (30 mg/kg)
caused tumor weight decreases that were equivalent (P > 0.6). Normal tissues were assessed with no long-term pathologic injury noted; see
H&E-stained livers (C). D, Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed signiﬁcant (P  0.04) survival advantages of deoxynyboquinone (5 mg/kg) or
b-lapachone-treated (30 mg/kg) groups. Groups were HPbCD alone (1,000 mg/kg), deoxynyboquinone (2.5, 5.0 mg/kg), or b-lapachone (30 mg/kg)

is consistent with a lower afﬁnity for one-electron oxidoreductases (i.e., b5R and P450R), as these enzymes are elevated in
mouse liver. Deoxynyboquinone showed equivalent antitumor
activity, suppressed tumor growth, and increased survival of
tumor-bearing mice as b-lapachone, but at 6-fold lower doses
(Fig. 7), consistent with its therapeutic window in vitro (Fig. 6).
However, our studies in vivo are in no way an optimization of
deoxynyboquinone delivery. Signiﬁcant dose-limiting methemaglobinemia was noted in deoxynyboquinone-treated mice, and
much less with b-lapachone (12). Such blood-borne toxicity can
be easily resolved, however, as methemaglobinemia was
completely prevented using b-lapachone "stealth" micellar delivery (12). In addition, novel deoxynyboquinone analogs that we
believe will avoid such limiting toxicities are currently being
tested using orthotopic breast, lung, prostate, and pancreatic
tumor models.
Our comparison of deoxynyboquinone to various quinones
as NQO1 substrates in vitro using NADH reutilization assays
(10) may explain its increased potency. At 1 mmol/L, NQO1
processed deoxynyboquinone approximately 13-fold more
efﬁciently than b-lapachone (1,400  80 vs. 110  20 relative
units, Supplementary Table S1). At equitoxic (LD100) levels,
similar NQO1 enzymatic activities (680  110 vs. 530  60

3046

Cancer Res; 72(12) June 15, 2012

relative units for 5 mmol/L b-lapachone vs. 0.25 mmol/L deoxynyboquinone, respectively, Supplementary Table S2) were
noted. The potential therapeutic window of deoxynyboquinone seems superior to b-lapachone, making deoxynyboquinone a potentially safer candidate for use as a chemotherapeutic drug, although increased potency may translate into
greater normal tissue toxicity. Thus, our studies strongly
suggest that deoxynyboquinone and future more soluble
derivatives and/or stealth polymeric nanoparticles will be
very promising anticancer therapeutics for the treatment of
NSCLC, pancreatic, and breast cancers.
