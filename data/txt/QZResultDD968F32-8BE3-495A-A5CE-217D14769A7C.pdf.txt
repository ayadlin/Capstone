ABSTRACT
Anti-angiogenesis targeting VEGFR2 has been an attractive strategy for cancer
therapy for its role in promoting cancer growth and metastasis. However, the currently
available drugs have unexpected side effects. Therefore, development of novel VEGFR2
inhibitors with less toxicity would be of great value. In this study, we describe a novel
and safely VEGFR2 inhibitor, Salinomycin (Sal), which was screened from the drug
libraries of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and prohibited the binding of the ATP
at its binding pocket of VEGFR2 using molecular docking model. Sal could interfere
a series of VEGF-induced angiogenesis processes including proliferation, migration,
and tube formation in HUVECS in vitro. Matrigel plug model demonstrated Sal strongly
inhibited angiogenesis in vivo. We found that Sal significantly decreased VEGF-induced
phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and its downstream STAT3 in dose- and time-dependent
manner in HUVECs. Besides, Sal could directly reduce the cell viability and induce
apoptosis in SGC-7901 cancer cells in vitro. Sal inhibited constitutive STAT3 activation
by blocking its DNA binding and reduced various gene products including Bcl-2, BclxL and VEGF both at mRNA and protein levels. Intra-peritoneal injection of Sal at
doses of 3 and 5 mg/kg/day markedly suppressed human gastric cancer xenografts
angiogenesis and growth without causing obvious toxicities. Taken together, Sal
inhibits tumor angiogenesis and growth of gastric cancer; our results reveal unique
characteristics of Sal as a promising anticancer drug candidate.

INTRODUCTION

mechanisms of tumor angiogenesis has recently allowed
successful translation into clinical applications. When
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a proangiogenic cytokine, specifically binds to distinct receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTKs) like VEGFR1 (Flt-1), VEGFR2
(KDR/ Flk-1), and VEGFR3, it can exhibit its biological
functions [4, 6]. Out of these kinases, VEGFR2 plays
a major role in transducing angiogenic signals [7]. The
autophosphorylation of Tyr1175 on VEGFR2 results in the
activation of downstream signaling events. Amongst the
endothelial cell signaling cascades, signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is frequently associated

Gastric cancer is one of the most common
digestive malignant neoplasms worldwide [1, 2]. Despite
considerable improvements that have been achieved
through systemic therapy, the mortality rate of gastric
cancer remains extremely high, and relapse and metastases
occur in most cases [3]. Therefore, safer and more
effective approaches are needed in gastric cancer therapy.
It is now well accepted that angiogenesis is a ratelimiting step in tumor progression, and provides a route
for tumor metastasis [4, 5]. Deciphering the molecular

Phe1047, Glu917 and Ala866 interacted with the protein
through the hydrophobic interaction (Figure 1B). And
the amino residues Glu885, Ile1025, Ile1044, Val898,
Cys1045 and Val916 interacted with the protein through
hydrophilic interaction (Figure 1B). Among them, the
residues of K868, V916, L840, L1035, V899, C1045 and
D1046 could interact with both of adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) and Sal compound by different interactions
(Figure 1C). Such binding pattern of Sal with VEGFR2 may
prohibit the binding of the ATP at its binding pocket.

with the transformation and progression of various human
malignancies. The activated STAT3 forms homodimers
and is then translocated into the nucleus to regulate the
expression of target genes involved in cell proliferation
(e.g., cyclinD1), survival (e.g., BCL-2, BCL-xl), invasion
(e.g., matrix metalloproteinase-9), and angiogenesis
(VEGF) [8]. Aberrant activation in the VEGFR2 signaling
pathway contributes to cell differentiation, proliferation,
metastasis, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and inflammation [9].
At present, several targeting VEGFR2 compounds have
been used in clinic, including FDA approved drugs such as
sorafenib, sunitinib, and vandetanib. Moreover, numerous
small molecule VEGFR2 inhibitors are under clinical and
preclinical evaluation, such as YLT192 [10] and SKLB261
[11]. However, adverse effects have been observed,
indicating that development of much more safer VEGFR2
inhibitors is still needed.
Salinomycin (Sal) (Figure 1A), a carboxylic
polyether ionophore isolated from Streptomyces albus,
has been used extensively as an agricultural antibiotic to
prevent coccidiosis in poultry [12]. Recent studies have
shown that Sal displays potent anti-tumor activities in
different types of human cancer stem cells (CSCs) [13, 14],
including colorectal-[15], lung-[16], gastric-[17],
pancreatic-[18], and osteosarcoma CSCs [19]. It also can
kill cancer cells, including those of colorectal-, prostate-,
breast-, ovarian-, hepatocellular- and chemotherapyresistant cancer cells and so on [20–29]. Sal kills these
cells most likely by increasing DNA damage [30, 31],
up-regulation of death receptor-5 [27], restoring
normal drug sensitivity in cancer cells [32], affecting
the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and activating
autophagy, mitophagy and mitochondrial polarity [33–
35] through activating AMP-activated protein kinase
[36], or inhibiting β-catenin/TCF complex association
via FOXO3a activation [37], Wnt/β-catenin [38–40],
STAT3/Skp2 [41], Akt/NF-κB/mTOR [42, 43] signaling
pathways. However, the role of Sal in tumor angiogenesis
and the related molecular action have not been clearly
elucidated. In this article, we evaluated the anti-angiogenic
and anti-tumorigenic activities of Sal in gastric cancer and
the involved molecular mechanism in vitro and vivo.

Salinomycin inhibited endothelial cell viability
Cell viability was examined using MTS assay.
As showed in Figure 2A and 2B, the proliferation of
endothelial cells induced by VEGF was decreased in a
dose-dependent manner after Sal or Regorafenib treatment
in the range of 0.5–5 μM for 72 h, indicating the inhibitory
effects of these two inhibitors dependent on VEGFinduced HUVECs proliferation. Especially, both of them
showed similar activity, with the half maximal inhibition
concentration (IC50) of 2.5 μM. To further examine whether
Sal would result in toxic effects in HUVECs, lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxic assays were carried out.
As shown in Figure 2C, at the effective concentration of
0.5–5 μM, Sal caused minimal toxicity in HUVECs.

Salinomycin inhibited VEGF-induced
endothelial cell migration and tube formation
in HUVECs
Cell migration is an essential step in angiogenesis.
Thus, we investigated the effects of Sal vis-a-vis
Regorafenib on the chemotactic motility of endothelial
cells using a wound-healing assay. The results showed
that Sal and Regorafenib concentrations ranging from
0.5–5 μM, significantly inhibited the migration of
VEGF-induced HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 3A). The inhibitory efficacy of Sal was similar with
that of Regorafenib. Then, we tested the effect of Sal and
Regorafenib on capillary-like tube formation in HUVECs.
When HUVECs were seeded on Matrigel, robust tubularlike structures were formed in the vehicle group within
8–10 h (Figure 3B). As shown in Figure 3B, almost 80%
of the tube network was destroyed when HUVECs were
incubated with either Sal or Regorafenib at 5 μM.

RESULTS
Salinomycin was located at the ATP-binding sites
of the VEGFR2 kinase domain

Salinomycin inhibited neovascularization in vivo
Using molecular docking analysis, a drug named
salinomycin (Figure 1A), which targeted the VEGFR2
protein, was screened from the drug libraries of FDA.
We assessed the binding pattern between the x-ray crystal
structure of VEGFR2 and Sal. Through analysis of the
Sal docking results, the results showed that Sal could
occupy the activity pocket. The amino residues Leu 840,

We further measured the in vivo anti-angiogenic
activity of Sal by a Matrigel plug assay. As shown in
Figure 4A, Matrigel plugs containing VEGF alone
appeared dark red, indicating that functional vasculatures
had formed inside the Matrigel via angiogenesis triggered
by VEGF. In contrast, the addition of different amounts of
Sal (15 or 30 mg per plug) to the Matrigel plugs containing
VEGF dramatically inhibited vascularization, as shown in
26581

Figure 4A. These plugs displayed a much paler appearance
(Figure 4B). Immunohistochemical staining indicated that
a large number of CD31-positive endothelial cells existed
inside the plugs with VEGF alone, whereas the number
of CD31-positive endothelial cells in Sal-treated groups
decreased dramatically (Figure 4C). These results indicated
that Sal inhibited VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vivo.

VEGFR1 activity. We found that Sal had little effect on
the constitutive phosphorylation of VEGFR1 under the
same conditions (Supplementary Figure 3). After being
activated by VEGF, activated STAT3 forms homodimers
or heterodimers, then translocates into the nucleus to result
specific DNA binding to the promoters of target genes and
thereby induced unique gene expression programs. The
result of an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
confirmed that treatment with Sal dramatically blocked
this process and led to the dose-dependent inhibition of
STAT3 DNA binding activity in HUVECs (Figure 5C).
These data indicated that in addition to the blockade of
constitutive STAT3 activation, Sal also exerted inhibitory
effects on irreducible STAT3 activity.

Salinomycin attenuated VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase
activity and VEGFR2-mediated STAT3 signaling
pathways in endothelial cells
It is known that VEGF signaling events relevant
to tumor angiogenesis are mainly mediated by VEGFR2
phosphorylation. The binding of VEGF to VEGFR2
leads to the activation of various downstream signaling
molecules responsible for endothelial cell proliferation,
migration, tube formation, and survival. In present studies,
we found that Sal, at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to
5 μM, inhibited the phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and
downstream STAT3 in HUVECs in a dose- (Figure 5B1)
and time- (Figure 5B2) dependent manner. In contrast,
total levels of VEGFR2 and STAT3 were not affected
by Sal treatment. Additionally, we performed additional
experiments and investigated whether Sal affected

Salinomycin inhibited STAT3 signaling in
SGC-7901 cells
Our study demonstrated that Sal exerts antiangiogenic
activity in vitro and in vivo through blocking VEGFR2/
STAT3 pathway in endothelial cells, suggesting that STAT3
is a potential target of Sal in gastric cancer cells. To address
such a possibility, we examined the inhibitory effect of Sal
on STAT3 in human gastric cancer SGC-7901 cells. The
results showed that Sal decreased the phosphorylation of

the STAT3 protein (at Y705) (Supplementary Figure 1A),
blocked DNA binding ability of STAT3 (Supplementary
Figure 1B) and modulated the expression of the antiapoptotic genes (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) and the angiogenic
gene product (VEGF) (Supplementary Figure 1C). The
mechanism was reportedly regulated by STAT3, at much
higher effective concentration ranging from 10 to 15 μmol/L.
Similarly, we also observed that secreted VEGF by SGC7901 was also dose-dependently inhibited by Sal analyzed
by Elisa assay (Supplementary Figure 1D).

in accompany with an increased expression of cleaved
caspase-3 in treatment of SGC-7901 cells 72 hours later
(Supplementary Figure 2C). In addition, we further
investigated the cytotoxicity of Sal on normal gastric
epithelial cells (GES-1). Our results showed that Sal
inhibited the proliferation of GES-1 cell with an IC50 over
20 μmol/L (Supplementary Figure 2A), which is much
higher than that observed in gastric cancer cells. Together,
these data suggested that Sal could induce apoptosis in
gastric tumor cells with low side effect.

Since Sal suppressed the activation of STAT3
and STAT3-regulated proliferative gene products, we
further explored the antiproliferative activity of Sal, a
broad of gastric cancer cell lines were treated with serial
concentrations of Sal by the MTS assay. Following 72 h
exposure to Sal, a dose-dependent growth suppression was
observed in all cancer cells, with an IC50 value ranging
between 10 and 15 μmol/L (Supplementary Figure 2A).
Similar findings also were confirmed by Annexin V/

Further, we evaluated the in vivo anti-angiogenic and
anti-tumorigenic activities of Sal using a xenograft model.
Once a tumor size of 120 mm3 was achieved, mice were
injected with vehicle (control), or vehicle with Sal. The used
dosage of Sal was chosen according to published literature
[44, 45]. As shown, intraperitoneal administration of Sal

(3 and 5 mg/kg/d, 28 days) significantly reduced tumor
volume (Figure 6A1) and tumor weight (Figure 6A2).
The percent of tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of Sal was
51.3% and 66.3% at 3 and 5 mg/kg/d groups. Furthermore,
Sal treatment was well tolerated, and there was no
significant difference in weight loss in all groups during
Sal treatment periods (Figure 6A3). Moreover, when the
skin of each mouse was pulled back to expose an intact
tumor, we found that Sal-mediated suppression of tumor
growth was well correlated with angiogenesis inhibition,
as shown in the representative image from each group
(Figure 6B1 and 6B2). Additionally, we assessed whether
Sal treatment would prolong the life span of mice. As a
surrogate of survival, mice were sacrificed when tumor
reach approximately 1,500 mm3 in any one dimension. A
Kaplan-Meier plot for the time course of survival showed
that Sal-treated mice survived for up to 80 days compared
to the normal group (Figure 6C).

To better understand the mechanism of
antitumor activities in vivo, we further carried out
immunohistochemical analysis using tumors tissues
at the end of the treatment. As shown in Figure 7,
Sal dramatically regulated the protein expressions of
markers for both cell proliferation (Ki67 staining) and
apoptosis (caspase-3 staining) in the treatment groups
as compared with the controls. To further investigate
whether Sal inhibited tumor growth by suppressing
tumor angiogenesis, immunostaining for specific
proteins was performed. Our results showed that the
number of CD31-positive endothelial cells and the
expression levels of VEGF, p-VEGFR2, and p-STAT3
were all significantly decreased. Collectively, these
results indicated that Sal-mediated suppression of SGC7901 xenograft growth in vivo was associated with
decreased neovascularization and proliferation as well
as increased apoptosis index.

DISCUSSION

inhibited neovascularization by matrigel plug assay
in vivo in a dose-dependent manner. Previous studies have
suggested that phosphorylation of VEGFR2 is critical for
VEGF-mediated neovascularization [5]. Here, we found
that Sal affects the multiple facets of vascular endothelial
angiogenic signaling through VEGFR2, via prohibiting
the binding of the ATP at its binding pocket of VEGFR2
using molecular docking assay and decreasing VEGFinduced phosphorylation of VEGFR2 (Tyr1,175) expression
without affecting the activation of VEGFR1 as observed
by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The results
suggested the possibility that Sal exerts its anti-angiogenic
effect preferentially via VEGFR2 signaling pathway. Many
kinase inhibitors could exert their inhibitory effects through
purely or partially competing against ATP and subsequently
suppressing the receptor autophosphorylation [47, 48].
They were acting as ATP minetics that bound to this site
and competed with cellular ATP. Using computational
modeling, we found that Sal may directly bind to VEGFR2
domain and could stably locate at the ATP-binding pocket.
There are seven amino acids at the ATP pocket, which

Angiogenesis inhibition has become an important
strategy for cancer therapy. More and more angiogenesis
inhibitors have been used in the clinic. These include
monoclonal antibody agents or small-molecule drugs,
which target VEGF ligands or VEGFR. However, their
success is insufficient and several issues have arisen from
their applications. They elicit some side effects, even
increase metastasis, and possibly develope treatment
resistance [46]. Hence, there is an urgent need to find new
anti-angiogenic inhibitors that can be more efficacious
and less toxic for cancer therapy, particularly agents that
exhibit activity against drug resistance and/or metastasis.
In this study, we report a significant finding that
Sal, a widely used agricultural antibiotic drug approved
by FDA, can directly act on both tumor endothelial cells
and tumor cells. We clearly demonstrated Sal inhibited
various aspects of angiogenesis including endothelial cell
proliferation, migration and capillary structure formation
in vitro at relatively lower concentration. Sal significantly

were essential for the stable conformation of VEGFR2/Sal
complex. Rest amino acids can interact with the protein
through the hydrophobic or hydrophilic interactions. All the
unique binding modes largely promoted the conformational
stability of the Sal/VEGFR2 complex, which interfered the
binding of VEGF to VEGFR2. Additionally, we found that
Sal also could indirectly reduce the paracrine secretion of
VEGF from tumor cells, which further strengthens its antiangiogenic activity.

Apart from the here described newly discovered
anti-angiogenic effect, our observation also showed
Sal had anti-tumorigenic effects. In current study, we
confirmed that Sal caused the inhibition of proliferation,
and induced substantial apoptosis in tumor cells by
prohibiting constitutive STAT3 activation in SGC-7901
cells and thereby its DNA binding ability. Sal further
reduced the expressions of STAT3-modulated Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL both at mRNA and protein levels, and increased

the levels of pro-caspase-3 all known to promote tumor
survival and tumor growth. Previous studies showed that
Sal is one ionophore with specificity for K+ ions and can
promote hyperpolarization of mitochondria [12]. These
effects on mitochondrial polarity leading to altered
metabolic dependence of cancer cells could be one reason
for additive cell death effect of Sal. On the other hand,
several reports demonstrated that autophagy is clearly
linked to cell death [49]. Sal can induce autophagy in
breast and colon cancer cell lines [33, 34], concomitant
to the induction of reactive oxygen species, which may be
another potential mechanism of caspase-independent cell
death caused by Sal.
Recently, Sal gained substantial attention when it
was first identified as a drug preferentially killing cancer
stem cells. Sal has been shown to overcome apoptosisresistance in several types of cancer cells with far less side
effects, and inhibits tumor metastasis and recurrence by
disruption TGF-β1-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and/or other signaling pathways
[50, 51], which might help to prevent and/or delay
treatment resistance in anti-angiogenic therapy. All these
characteristics could be reasonable to make Sal distinct
from present angiogenesis inhibitors; especially those
used in the clinic, and become a promising anticancer drug
candidate. However, further studies are needed to improve
its biological activity and physicochemical properties.

China Normal University, Shanghai, China) and cultured
in endothelial cell culture medium (ECM) as described
previously [52]. Both AGS, a human gastric cancer cell
line and GES1, a normal gastric epithelia cell line were
purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Other
SGC-7901, MGC-803, and BGC-823 cancer cell lines
were obtained from the China Center for Type Culture
Collection. All these cells were cultured in RPMI-1640
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells
were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C with
5% CO2 and the medium was replaced every 48 h.

Molecular docking
The docking essay was carried out to assess the
binding pattern between VEGFR2 receptor and Sal by
using Autodock 4.2 [53]. The ligands were drawn by using
Chemoffice and transported to 3D structure by using
Openbabel without structure optimization [54]. The
receptor and ligands were prepared for docking by using
the MGLTools1.5.6 [53], with adding Gasteiger Charges
and polar hydrogen. The protein structure was obtained
from Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org), and the
water and salt ions were removed for the next step. For the
docking parameters, the size of grid box was 56Å * 40Å *
40Å and the center of box was (−27.76, −0.681, −8.054).
The graphics of molecule-protein interaction was showed

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell viability assay

Chemicals and reagents

HUVECs or gastric cancer cell lines were seeded
at 4.5 × 103 to 5.5 × 103 cells per well in 96-well culture
plates and treated with or without VEGF (10 ng/mL) or
increasing serial dosages of Sal (0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, and
15 μM) for 72 h. Regorafenib served as a positive control.
Cell viability was determined using the MTS assay as
described previously [52]. After 2 h of incubation, the
absorbance was measured at 490 nm with a microplate
reader (Bio-Red, USA). Three independent experiments
were performed.

Reagents of Salinomycin (Sal) and Regorafenib
(Reg) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA)
and Selleck Chemicals (Shanghai, China), respectively.
Both of them was dissolved in 100% DMSO to form a
20 mM solution and stored at −80°C in small aliquots until
needed. Growth factor-reduced Matrigel was purchased
from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Antibodies against
VEGFR2 (2479#), STAT3 (9139#), Bcl2 (#2872), BCL-xl
(#2764), Caspase-3(#9664), and phosphor-specific antiVEGFR2 (Tyr1,175) (#2478) and anti-STAT3 (Tyr705) (#9145)
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers,
MA, USA). Anti-CD31 (#ab28364), anti-Ki67 (#ab66155),
anti-VEGFR1 (ab32152#) and phosphor-specific antiVEGFR1 (Y1213) (ab195762#) were provided by Abcam
(UK). Recombinant human VEGF (VEGF165) (#293-VE010) and VEGF ELISA kits (#DVE00) were purchased
from R&D Systems (MN, USA). All other reagents were
acquired from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA).

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) toxicity assay
The LDH release assay was performed using a
cytotoxicity detection kit plus (LDH) (Roche Diagnostics)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief,
HUVECs were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density
of 5 × 103 cells per well. After incubation with various
concentrations of Sal for 72 h, cell supernatants were collected
and analyzed. The absorbance of formed formazan was read
at 490 nm with a microplate reader (Biorad, USA). The
LDH content of each sample was calculated according to the
following formula: Cytotoxicity (%) = (experimental value −
low control)/ (high control − low control) × 100. The assay
was independently repeated three times.

cells were directly treated with indicated dilutions of Sal
for 12 h. Whole cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer
supplemented with PMSF and proteinase inhibitor before
use. Proteins were separated by 6–10% SDS PAGE and
transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes.
Membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies
as described before [52]. Immunoreactive bands were then
visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)
detection system.

HUVECs (5 × 104 cells per well) were allowed to
grow to full confluence in 6-well plates pre-coated with
0.1% gelatin and then starved with basic ECM overnight.
Thereafter, cells were wounded by scratching with pipette
tips and washed with PBS. ECM supplemented with 0.5%
FBS and different concentrations of Sal was added into
the 6-well culture dishes. Regorafenib served as a positive
control. Images of cells were taken using an inverted
microscope (TE2000, Nikon, Japan) at 100× magnification
after 7–9 h of incubation. The migrated cells were observed
from three randomly selected fields and quantified by
manual counting. Cells receiving only medium served as
a vehicle control. Inhibition percentage was expressed as
a percentage of the vehicle control (100%). The assay was
independently repeated three times.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
The concentrations of VEGF in Sal-treated SGC7901 culture medium were measured using a Human
VEGF ELISA kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN USA).

RNA isolation and reverse transcription PCR
Endothelial cell capillary-like tube formation
assay

Total RNA from SGC-7901 cancer cells treated
with different concentration of Sal for 72 h was extracted
with the TRIzol reagent and converted to cDNA using
a reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) kit (Thermo).
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
was used as a loading control.

The tube formation assay was conducted as described
previously [52]. After Matrigel polymerisation at 37°C for
1 h, HUVECs (8 × 104 cells per well) were suspended in
ECM and pre-treated with different concentrations of Sal or
Regorafenib for 30 min, and then seeded onto the Matrigel.
After 8–10 h of incubation, the network-like structures
of endothelial cells were examined under an inverted
microscope (TE2000, Nikon, Japan) at 100× magnification.
Branching points in three random fields per well were
quantified by manual counting. Cells receiving only ECM
served as a vehicle control. Inhibition percentage was
expressed as a percentage of the vehicle control (100%).
The assay was independently repeated three times.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay
The DNA binding activity of STAT3 was examined
by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using IRDye700
an infrared dye-labelled oligonucleotide probe (LI-COR,
Biosciences) and analyzed in both HUVECs and SGC7901 cells based on conditions defined by procedures from
LI-COR.

Matrigel plug assay

Annexin V/propidium iodide staining assay

As described previously [52], 0.5 mL of Matrigel
in the presence or absence of 100 ng of VEGF, 20 units
of heparin, and the indicated amount of Sal (15 and
30 μg) was subcutaneously injected into the ventral area of
C57BL/6 mice (n = 3). Seven days after the implantation,
intact Matrigel plugs were carefully removed. Those plugs
were then fixed and embedded in paraffin. Specific blood
vessel staining with CD31 antibody was carried out on 5
μm sections according to the protocol. Microphotographs
were taken using an OLYMPUS BX41 photomicroscope
(magnification at 400×).

Sal-mediated cell apoptosis was assayed by Annexin
V/fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide staining
(ApopNexin Annexin V FITC apoptosis kit; Millipore) as
described in the instructions. Microphotographs were taken
by an OLYMPUS BX41 photomicroscope (magnification
at 200×).

In vivo anti-tumour activity
Briefly, SGC-7901 cells (3.5 × 106 cell per mouse)
were subcutaneously implanted into the flanks of 6-weekold BALB/cA nude mice. When tumors grew to about 120
mm3, the mice were randomly divided into three groups
(n = 9). They were then intraperitoneally treated with or
without Sal (3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg) every other day. The
tumor volume was measured using a vernier caliper and
calculated according to the modified ellipsoid formula:
Tumor volume (mm3) = (length) × (width) 2 × 0.52. After
80 days of treatment, the mice were sacrificed and whole
tumor tissues were harvested, weighed, and photographed.

Western blotting analysis
To determine the effects of Sal on VEGFR2-mediated
signaling cascades, HUVECs were first starved overnight
in basic ECM. After being washed with fresh medium,
cells were treated with Sal (0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 10 and 5 μM) for
2–4 h, followed by stimulation with 50 ng/mL of VEGF for
10–15 min. Normal cultures of SGC-7901 gastric cancer

Excised tumors were fixed in 10% formaldehyde and
embedded in paraffin for immunohistochemical observation.
Sections with a thickness of 5 μm were stained with
antibodies against CD31, VEGF, p-VEGFR2, p-STAT3,
and caspase-3. Microvessel density was calculated using
ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Survival was
evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Microphotographs
were taken using an OLYMPUS BX41 photomicroscope
(magnification at 400×). All procedures used for animal
experimentation were approved by the Institutional Animal
Ethics Committee.
