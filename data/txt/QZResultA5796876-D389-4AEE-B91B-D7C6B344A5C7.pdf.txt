ABSTRACT
Chemoresistance to anti-cancer drugs substantially reduces survival in
epithelial ovarian cancer. In this study, we showed that chemoresistance to
cisplatin and paclitaxel induced the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and a
stem cell phenotype in ovarian cancer cells. Chemoresistance was associated with
the downregulation of epithelial markers and the upregulation of mesenchymal
markers, EMT-related transcription factors, and cancer stem cell markers, which
enhanced invasion and sphere formation ability. Overexpression of FOXM1 increased
cisplatin-resistance and sphere formation in cisplatin-sensitive and low FOXM1expressing ovarian cancer cells. Conversely, depletion of FOXM1 via RNA interference
reduced cisplatin resistance and sphere formation in cisplatin-resistant and high
FOXM1-expressing cells. Overexpression of FOXM1 also increased the expression,
nuclear accumulation, and activity of β-CATENIN in chemoresistant cells, whereas
downregulation of FOXM1 suppressed these events. The combination of cisplatin and
the FOXM1 inhibitor thiostrepton inhibited the expression of stem cell markers in
chemoresistant cells and subcutaneous ovarian tumor growth in mouse xenografts.
In an analysis of 106 ovarian cancer patients, high FOXM1 levels in tumors were
associated with cancer progression and short progression-free intervals. Collectively,
our findings highlight the importance of FOXM1 in chemoresistance and suggest that
FOXM1 inhibitors may be useful for treatment of ovarian cancer.

INTRODUCTION

gynecological malignancy and a major contributor
to death from cancer in women [1]. While the initial
response to first-line therapy (cytoreductive surgery and
combined platinum-paclitaxel chemotherapy) is usually
effective, most cancers recur, are chemotherapy-resistant,
and result in the death of the patient. The mechanism
responsible for chemoresistance in epithelial ovarian
cancer (EOC) remains little understood, and overcoming

β-CATENIN-mediated
stemness and tumorigenesis

chemoresistance is an important goal in cancer therapy [2].

Chemoresistance of cancer stem cells is critical for
cancer therapy

The WNT network influences a wide range of
biological processes including developmental cell fate,
cell polarity and adhesion, tumorigenesis, and apoptosis.
Numerous studies suggest that it promotes tumorigenesis
by maintaining stem and CSC populations [24, 25]. The
key feature of WNT signaling activation is β-CATENIN
nuclear localization. Reciprocal regulation of the WNT/
β-CATENIN pathway and FOXM1 has been reported
recently. Mirza et al. showed that FOXM1 directly binds
the human β-CATENIN promoter and upregulates its
expression in endothelial cells [26]. On the other hand,
Zhang et al. found that WNT3A increases the abundance
of nuclear FOXM1, which interacts with and promotes
the nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity of
β-CATENIN in tumor cells [27]. Moreover, both proteins
formed a complex with the TCF transcription factors on
the promoters of WNT/β-CATENIN target genes. These
findings show that FOXM1 controls the expression of
WNT target genes by interacting with β-CATENIN or its
promoter.

Accumulated evidence has led to the hypothesis that
solid tumors contain a small subpopulation of cancer stem
cells (CSCs), which are self-renewing and responsible for
tumor maintenance, metastasis, and possibly resistance
to chemotherapy and radiotherapy [3, 4]. CSCs are
enriched in tumors and cultured cancer cells treated with
chemotherapeutic drugs and, therefore, are resistant to
chemotherapy. In clinical practice, optimal chemotherapy
kills most of the cells in solid tumors. However, CSCs
acquire changes that confer drug resistance and hence
a selection advantage, eventually generating a new
population of chemoresistant cancer cells [5, 6]. Such
changes include cell quiescence and expression of
membrane transporters that pump drugs out of cells [7].
As a result, CSCs survive chemotherapy and regenerate
the tumor. Targeting treatments to CSCs would thus
be a logical way of overcoming chemoresistance and
improving the outcome of cancer treatment. However,
the mechanisms involved in CSC chemoresistance are
complex and not clearly defined.

FOXM1 inhibitors are effective against tumors

FOXM1 regulates stemness and chemoresistance
in cancers

FOXM1 is an attractive molecular target for
anticancer therapies because it interacts with numerous
signaling pathways and it is expressed by many solid
tumors. FOXM1 inhibitors such as the thiazole antibiotics
siomycin A and thiostrepton [28, 29], induce the apoptosis
of many types of cancer cells and have been approved
by the Federal Drug Administration for animal use.
Treatment of human cancer cell lines with siomycin A or
thiostrepton not only inhibits FOXM1 activity but also
its expression [30]. Importantly, FOXM1 inhibitors have
no effect on FOXM1 expression in or the proliferation of
nontransformed cells and exert minimal toxicity against
noncancer cells.
In the present study, we show that FOXM1 is a
critical regulator of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT), stemness, and chemoresistance in ovarian cancer
cells. WNT/β-CATENIN signaling required FOXMI, as
did the growth of ovarian cancers. A clinical investigation
established a relationship between FOXM1 expression and
unfavorable outcomes in EOC patients, thus validating our
in vitro findings.

FOXM1, a member of the forkhead transcription
factor family [8], is required for cell cycle progression [911], apoptosis [12], angiogenesis [13], and DNA damage
repair [14]. In addition, aberrant expression of FOXM1 is
linked to tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. A systemic
analysis of gene expression profiles in microarrays showed
that FOXM1 mRNA was overexpressed in nearly every
tumor analyzed, including ovarian tumors [15]. Other
studies showed that FOXM1 and its downstream DNA
damage repair targets BRCA1, BRCA2, and XRCC1
increased cisplatin resistance in different types of
cancer cells [16-18], as well as herceptin and paclitaxel
[19] resistance in breast cancer cells. FOXM1 is highly
expressed in multipotent progenitor cells and inhibits their
differentiation [20, 21] and, as more recently reported,
upregulates the expression of the pluripotent genes OCT4, NANOG, and SOX-2 when overexpressed [22]. FOXM1
also participates in an early oncogenic pathway that
predisposes cells to tumorigenesis by expanding the stem/
progenitor cell compartment [23]. These findings suggest
a critical involvement of FOXM1 in the maintenance of
stem cell pluripotency.

established. As shown in Fig. 1A, the IGROV1 sublines
CP1 and CP2 were more resistant to cisplatin than
parental cells (IC50 values were 5.88, 12.57, and 2.78 µM,
respectively; P = 0.002, Kruskal-Wallis test). Similarly,
the IGROV1 subline TX0.005 was more resistant to
paclitaxel than parental cells (IC50 values were 0.60 µg/mL
and 0.02 µg/mL, respectively; P = 0.002). Compared with
parental cells, the drug resistant cells had an elongated
mesenchymal-like morphology and fewer cell-cell
junctions (Fig. 1B).

Chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells have an EMT
phenotype and high invasion ability

that chemoresistant cells formed non-adherent spheres,
whereas parental cells did not. Cisplatin-resistant cells
formed more spheres than paclitaxel-resistant cells (Fig.
2B), and cells selected with a higher dose of cisplatin
(CP2) formed larger spheres (> 50 µm) than cells
selected with a lower dose of cisplatin (CP1) (Fig. S1).
Chemoresistant cells expressed higher amounts of the
stem cell markers BMI1, CD44, NANOG, SOX-2, and
MYD88 than parental cells (Fig. 2C). We also examined
the expression of stem cell markers in the canonical
cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer
cell limes A2780 (IC50 = 5.70 µM) and A2780CP70 (IC50 =
30.66 µM) (Fig. 3A). Our results showed that A2780CP70
cells overexpressed several stem cells markers as well as
FOXM1 (Fig. 4A).

Mesenchymal
markers
(VIMENTIN,
FIBRONECTIN, and N-CADHERIN) and EMTassociated transcription factors (SNAIL1, SLUG, and
TWIST) were upregulated in chemoresistant cells
compared with parental cells, whereas epithelial markers
(E-CADHERIN, γ-CATENIN, and ZO-1) were downregulated (Fig. 1C). In addition, FOXM1 expression
was markedly increased in chemoresistant cells.
Immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 1D) confirmed the
changes in VIMENTIN and E-CADHERIN expression
observed in western blots and showed that VIMENTIN
was expressed in the cytoplasm and E-CADHERIN
primarily in cell-cell junctions. Chemoresistant IGROV1
cells exhibited abundant VIMENTIN staining in the
cytoplasm and scarce expression of E-CADHERIN. In
vitro transwell invasion assays showed that chemoresistant
IGROV1 cells were more invasive than parental cells
(Fig. 1E). Collectively, these data indicate that the
chemoresistant cells acquired an EMT phenotype and
invasive ability.

FOXM1 enhances cisplatin resistance and sphere
formation in ovarian cancer cells
The higher expression of FOXM1 in chemoresistant
cells than parental cells (Figs. 1C and 4A) suggests that
FOXM1 may contribute to chemoresistance. To test
this premise, we examined FOXM1 expression in two
additional ovarian cancer cell lines. BG-1 cells expressed
less FOXM1 than SKOV-3 cells (Fig. 3B) and were less
resistant to cisplatin (IC50 of SKOV-3 = 7.31 µM, IC50 of
BG-1 = 3.13 µM) (Fig. 3B). We then established three
BG-1 stable clones that overexpressed FOXM1 and three
stable SKOV-3 clones that expressed FOXM1 shRNA. As
shown in Fig. 5A, FOXM1-overexpressing cells (#a, #b,
and #c) exhibited higher cisplatin resistance than vector-

Chemoresistance contributes to the stemness of
ovarian cancer cells
We examined sphere formation and the expression
of stem cell markers in cisplatin-resistant and
paclitaxel-resistant IGROV1 cells. Figure 2A shows

ANOVA) and sphere formation (Figs. 4B and 5C). In
contrast, FOXM1 silencing in A2780CP70 cells decreased
cisplatin resistance compared with the vector control (IC50
values were 10.89, 21.39, and 26.07 µM, respectively; P
< 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test) and sphere formation (Figs.
4B and 5D). Of note, the effects of FOXM1 on these
responses were dose-dependent. We also determined
whether FOXM1 affects the expression of human copper
transporter 1 (hCTR1), which transports cisplatin into cells
to elicit a cytotoxic effect. Overexpression of FOXM1
in the human embryonic kidney Ad293 cells decreased

transfected cells (IC50 values were 6.90, 4.83, 4.36, and
1.95 µM, respectively; P = 0.016, one-way ANOVA)
and higher sphere formation ability. Conversely, SKOV3 cells depleted of FOXM1 (#a, #b, and #c) were less
resistant to cisplatin than vector-transfected cells (IC50
values were 3.14, 4.68, 6.01, and 8.82 µM, respectively;
P < 0.001, one-way ANOVA) and had lower sphere
formation ability (Fig. 5B). The effect of FOXM1 on
chemoresistance and stemness was also investigated in
A2780 and A2780CP70 cells. Overexpression of FOXM1
in A2780 cells (#a and #b) enhanced cisplatin resistance
compared with the vector control (IC50 values were 12.44,

FOXM1 promotes β-CATENIN expression,
activation, and nuclear localization in
chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells

The frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs) are secreted
signaling molecules that antagonize WNT/β-CATENIN
signaling. We examined the effects of SFRP5 and an
activator of WNT/β-CATENIN signaling (WNT3A) on
FOXM1 expression in A2780CP70 cells. When added
to the culture medium, WNT3A increased FOXM1
expression, and SFRP5 decreased FOXM1 expression,
in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 9A). Overexpression
of SFRP5 inhibited the activity of the FOXM1 promoter
in a dose-dependent manner, whereas SFRP5 silencing
increased FOXM1 expression (Fig. 9B, C). In addition,
SFRP5 expression inversely correlated with FOXM1
expression in ES-2 and TOV-21G ovarian cancer cells
(Fig. 9D).

WNT/β-CATENIN signaling upregulates the
expression of FOXM1

Total β-CATENIN expression and activation
(indicated by β-CATENIN dephosphorylation) were higher
in both cisplatin-resistant and paclitaxel-resistant IGROV1
cells than parental cells, as was expression of c-MYC,
which is encoded by a β-CATENIN target gene (Fig. 7A)
Chemoresistant cells had higher nuclear levels of FOXM1
and β-CATENIN than parental cells. Immunofluorescence
staining revealed that β-CATENIN was located in the
plasma membrane between cell-cell junctions (where it
mediates adherence) in parental cells. In chemoresistant
cells, it was mostly cytoplasmic or nuclear (Fig. 7B), and
nuclear β-CATENIN co-localized with FOXM1 (Fig. 7C).
Knockdown of FOXM1 impaired nuclear localization and
accumulation of β-CATENIN in both cisplatin-resistant

cisplatin

mouse xenografts compared with the vehicle control,
and the combination of cisplatin and thiostrepton was
more effective than either alone (Fig. 10B, C; P = 0.004,
Kruskal-Wallis test).

Our findings suggest that FOXM1 promotes the
formation of CSCs and chemoresistance. We asked
whether inhibiting FOXM1 activity could be an effective
therapeutic strategy in chemoresistant ovarian cancer.
As shown in Figs. 10A and S2, the FOXM1 inhibitor
thiostrepton decreased the expression of FOXM1 and stem
cell markers in a dose-dependent manner in A2780CP70
cells. Pretreatment of cells with thiostrepton sensitized
cisplatin-resistant A2780CP70 cells to cisplatin (Fig.

cisplatin inhibited the growth of A2780CP70 cells in

Among 141 EOC samples in tissue microarrays
(TMAs) (Table 1), FOXM1 expression determined via
immunohistochemistry (IHC) was higher in the serous and
endometrioid subtypes and lower in the mucinous subtype
and normal ovarian tissue. The relationship between
FOXM1 expression in TMA and clinical demographics
was examined (Table 2). Higher FOXM1 expression was
significantly associated with serous histology (P = 0.011;
Table 2). The association between FOXM1 expression and
clinical outcome was analyzed in 106 newly diagnosed
EOC patients at our hospital (Table 3). The patients ranged
in age from 27 to 80 years (median, 53 years). Thirty-five
(33.0%) patients had FIGO stage I disease, 10 (9.4%)
had stage II disease, 55 (51.9%) had stage III disease,
and 6 (5.7%) had stage IV disease. Serous, endometrioid,
clear cell, and mucinous type histology were found in 52
(49.1%), 15 (14.2%), 28 (26.4%), and 11 (10.4%) patients,
respectively. There were 10 (9.4%) well differentiated, 26
(24.5%) moderately differentiated, and 70 (66.0%) poorly
differentiated tumors. Optimal cytoreductive surgery was
performed in 87 (82.1%) patients. First-line platinumbased regimens included paclitaxel plus carboplatin
(n = 88, 83.0%) or cisplatin plus cyclophosphamide
(n = 18, 17.0%). Furthermore, 69 patients (65.1%) had

DISCUSSION

ability than paclitaxel-resistant IGROV1 cells, perhaps
because paclitaxel-mediated microtubule polymerization
limits the acquisition of the EMT phenotype and
invasiveness. Altogether, our findings provide an
explanation for the high recurrence rate following firstline cisplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy, and this should
be noted by clinicians.
The cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents in
cancer cells is dependent on their uptake and extrusion.
Copious clinical data associate the multi-drug resistance
(MDR) phenotype in tumors with the overexpression
of certain ABC transporters termed MDR proteins
[34]. FOXM1 and its downstream DNA damage
repair targets RAD51 [35], NBS1 [36], BRIP1 [37],
BRCA2, and XRCC1 have been shown to render cells
resistant to cisplatin [18], epirubicin [37], herceptin, and
paclitaxel [19]. How FOXM1 regulates the transport
of chemotherapeutic agents into and out of cancer cells
via plasma membrane transporters is, however, unclear.
hCTR1 is a transmembrane protein that transports copper
and cisplatin into mammalian cells. Our data suggest that
FOXM1 may confer cisplatin resistance, at least in part,
by inhibiting hCTR1 expression (Fig. 6). This is the first
study to demonstrate a direct link between FOXM1 and
cisplatin uptake.
The EMT phenotype and CSCs play critical roles
in chemoresistance [38, 39]. It has been suggested that
the WNT/β-CATENIN and transforming growth factor
(TGF-β)/SMAD signaling pathways, acting downstream
of FOXM1 targets, drive cancer progression by inducing
the EMT. WNT/β-CATENIN target genes can be divided
into a stemness/proliferation group and an EMT/
dissemination group. β-CATENIN has been shown to
activate LEF-1 transcription in regulating the expression
of several EMT-related genes during the EMT [40], and
FOXM1 has been shown to maintain the nuclear SMAD3/
SMAD4 complex [41].
Both FOXM1 and β-CATENIN are potent
transcription factors that regulate many aspects
of tumorigenesis. The reciprocity of FOXM1 and
β-CATENIN signaling may amplify both pathways, which
have been shown to exert multiple functions related to
drug resistance, EMT, stemness, and migration/invasion.
Ovarian cancer cells that gain EMT-related functions and
stemness during the development of drug resistance can
contribute to cancer recurrence. In this study, we found
that upregulation of FOXM1 promoted β-CATENIN
nuclear translocation and activation. Conversely, FOXM1
was a downstream target of β-CATENIN. FOXM1 may
be a useful target for overcoming the chemoresistance of
ovarian cancer cells because it is upstream of multiple
cancer-related signaling pathways and amplifies
β-CATENIN signaling.
CSCs have emerged as new targets for anti-cancer
therapy in addition to non-CSC tumor cells. Elimination
of CSCs, which play a major role in drug resistance

FOXM1 is a proto-oncoprotein that is overexpressed
in various types of cancer. Because it modulates tumor
growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, apoptosis, DNA
damage repair, and tissue regeneration in different types
of cancer cells, it may play diverse roles in tumorigenesis.
FOXM1 is frequently upregulated in ovarian cancers,
most notably (and significantly) in high-grade tumors
with aggressive behavior, such as metastasized lymph
nodes. Ectopic expression of FOXM1 markedly enhances
cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in ovarian
cancer cells, and it is antagonized by p53 [31]. Recent
analysis of 489 high-grade serous ovarian cancers by the
Cancer Genome Atlas consortium indicates that FOXM1
overexpression may be a key, early event driving the
growth of epithelial ovarian cancers, especially those
with serous pathophysiology. Pathway analyses suggest
that NOTCH and FOXM1 signaling contribute to serous
ovarian cancer pathophysiology [32]. Moreover, FOXM1
hyperactivity is a consistent feature of epithelial ovarian
cancer and contributes to ovarian cancer metastasis as well
as proliferation [33].
We identified FOXM1 as a candidate biomarker
of chemoresistance and poor outcome in ovarian cancer.
The principal findings of our study are that FOXM1
reduces the sensitivity of cells to anti-cancer drugs such
as cisplatin and paclitaxel in vitro and that FOXM1
overexpression in tumors predicts cancer progression
and unfavorable prognosis, especially in young EOC
patients, patients with serous histology, and patients
receiving platinum-paclitaxel combination chemotherapy.
Our results also suggest that chemoresistance induces the
EMT and stem cell phenotypes in ovarian cancer cells and
thereby enhances invasion and sphere formation ability.
Chemoresistance may be induced after exposure to
cisplatin and paclitaxel via reciprocal interaction between
FOXM1 and the WNT/β-CATENIN signaling pathway,
and FOXM1 is a major inducer of the expression, nuclear
translocation, and activation of β-CATENIN, as well as a
possible inhibitor of hCTR1-mediated cellular import of
cisplatin.
Chemotherapy is an important therapeutic strategy
for most patients with cancer. An understanding of the
molecular mechanisms underlying chemoresistance in
patients with aggressive cancers, such as EOC, might
aid the design of new treatment strategies. In our study,
ovarian cancer cells resistant to cisplatin or paclitaxel
showed similar molecular changes, including the
upregulation of mesenchymal markers, EMT-associated
transcription factors, and stem cell markers and the
downregulation of epithelial markers. Moreover, our
unpublished findings suggest the possibility of crossresistance between cisplatin and paclitaxel in a cell-based
model. Cisplatin-resistant IGROV1 cells exhibited more
pronounced changes in cell morphology and invasive

and disease recurrence, is critical to improving cancer
treatment outcomes. Both FOXM1 and β-CATENIN,
whose expression was FOXM1-dependent, are CSC
markers. Our study demonstrates that the combination
of thiostrepton, a FOXM1 inhibitor, and cisplatin
significantly decreases the expression of stem cell markers
and suppresses tumor formation in vivo. It also suggests
that inclusion of FOXM1 inhibitors in chemotherapy
regimens can help eradicate ovarian CSCs, as well as nonCSC ovarian tumor cells, by overcoming drug resistance.
The development of platinum resistance is a
complex molecular process. Predictors of platinum
resistance would help identify subgroups at high risk
during early cancer progression, and patients should be
individually assessed to determine the optimal therapy in
terms of tumor recurrence and platinum sensitivity. Our
observations that FOXM1 is highly expressed in platinumresistant cell lines and that FOXM1 overexpression is
associated with the progression of serous type EOCs
are consistent. They also agree with previous findings
linking FOXM1 signaling to serous ovarian cancer
pathophysiology [32]. High FOXM1 expression at
diagnosis may predict unfavorable PFIs and PFS.
Individualized therapies, such as dose-dense first-line
chemotherapy [42], paclitaxel maintenance chemotherapy
[43], and combination chemotherapy with an antiangiogenic agent as first-line or maintenance therapy [44],
could be implemented to prolong PFIs and improve longterm prognosis. Future clinical trials should be designed to
evaluate the usefulness of FOXM1 inhibitors in platinumbased chemotherapy.

cycles. After the completion of three cycles at the initial
concentration, the dose of cisplatin or paclitaxel was
doubled and the procedure repeated until the noted drug
levels with significant cell death were achieved. The IC50
values of the chemoresistant sublines were determined via
MTT assays.

Plasmids, shRNA, siRNA, and transfection
The full-length cDNAs for FOXM1 and
SFRP5 and the shRNA sequences for FOXM1 and
SFRP5 were described previously [45-47]. The
sequence of the FOXM1 siRNA (siFOXM1) was
5’-CCUUUCCCUGCACGACAUGtt-3’
(Qiagen).
Plasmids, shRNAs, and siRNAs were transfected
into ovarian cancer cells using LipofectamineTM 2000
(Invitrogen), and stable clones were selected with G418
or hygromycin.

MTT assays
Ovarian cancer cells were seeded at a density of 3
× 103 cells per well in 96-well plates. The following day,
the cells received various doses of cisplatin, paclitaxel,
or thiostrepton. After treatment, MTT (20 µL, 5 mg/mL;
Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each well, and the plates
were stored at 37°C for 4 hours. Dimethylsulfoxide (100
µL) was added to each well to lyse the cells. Absorbance
was measured at 570 nm.

Immunofluorescence
staining,
microscopy, and image analysis

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Ovarian cancer cells were grown in glass-bottom
dishes overnight, fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde
for 20 minutes, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100
for 10 minutes, and blocked with SuperBlock Blocking
Buffer (Thermo) for 1 hour at room temperature. Cells
were then incubated overnight at 4°C with anti-FOXM1
(Santa Cruz), anti-β-CATENIN, anti-E-CADHERIN, or
anti-VIMENTIN (BD) primary antibody and subsequently
with Alexa 488 or 543-conjugated secondary antibody
(Invitrogen) and the DNA dye Hoechst 33258 (10 mg/
mL) for 1 hour at room temperature. Immunofluorescence
images were taken on a laser scanning confocal
microscope (Olympus FLUOVIEW FV1000) using a 405
nm, 488 nm, or 543 nm laser.

Cell lines and reagents
Cells were maintained as adherent monolayers in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Ad293
cells), McCoy’s 5A medium (ES-2 cells), 1:1 MCDB105/
M199 medium (TOV-21G cells), RPMI 1640 medium
(IGROV1, A2780, and A2780CP70 cells), or DMEM/
F12 medium (SKOV-3 and BG-1 cells) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum under 5% CO2 at 37°C.
Recombinant human SFRP5 and WNT3a peptides were
purchased from R&D Systems.

Selection of drug-resistant ovarian cancer sublines

Western blots

Chemoresistant sublines were obtained by
exposing ovarian cancer cells to stepwise increases
in cisplatin (Sigma-Aldrich) or paclitaxel (SigmaAldrich) concentrations. The cells received cisplatin or

the right scapular region of pathogen-free female NOD/
SCID mice. The length (L) and width (W) of the resulting
tumors were measured using calipers, and tumor size was
calculated as W2 × L/2.

Drug preparation and administration
Cisplatin was diluted in normal saline, and
thiostrepton was dissolved in N,N-dimethylacetamide,
polyethylene glycol 400, and Tween 80 at a 2:7:1 v/v/v
ratio. Cisplatin and thiostrepton were intravenously
injected into mice seven days after tumor cell inoculation
at 3 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg mouse body weight, respectively.
Cisplatin was injected every three days, and thiostrepton
was injected daily.

Dual luciferase assay
The FOXM1 luciferase reporter construct (pLucFOXM1) was described previously [8]. Cells were cotransfected with pLuc-FOXM1 or other gene-specific
expression plasmids, and, for normalization of transfection
efficiency, pβ-ACTIN-RL, which contains the Renilla
luciferase gene under the control of the human β-ACTIN
promoter, was used. Luciferase activity was quantified
using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega
Corporation).

TMAs
Formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded TMA slides
of primary ovarian carcinoma and normal ovarian tissues
[TMA-OV2085 (208 cores/104 cases) and TMA-OV809
(80 cores/80 cases)] were purchased from US Biomax,
Inc. EOC patients and 20 subjects with normal ovarian
epithelia were included in the early stage of our analyses.
FOXM1 expression determined via IHC was compared
in the various groups based on the provided patient
characteristics.

Sphere formation assay
Cells were cultured in ultra-low attached plates
in serum-free medium containing 5 µg/mL insulin,
0.4% bovine serum albumin, 10 ng/mL basic fibroblast
growth factor, and 20 ng/mL human recombinant
epidermal growth factor for seven days. The spheres in
the suspension cultures were counted on a widefield light
microscope.

EOC patients and tissue samples
Consecutive patients diagnosed with EOC
between April 1993 and October 2010 at National
Cheng Kung University Hospital were included in our
study. These patients underwent comprehensive staging
or cytoreductive surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy
consisting of platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents.
Patients who received primary surgery elsewhere or
who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy or did not
provide written informed consent were excluded. Cancer
progression was defined according to the objective
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
version 1.1 or the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup
definition for CA125 progression. EOC patients were
clinically defined as “resistant,” “partially sensitive,” and
“sensitive” to platinum on the basis of their PFIs (< 6,
6–12, and > 12 months, respectively) [48, 49]. Both PFS
and OS were calculated from the date of diagnosis. OS
was measured to the date of death from any cause; data
on survivors were censored on the date they were last
known to be alive. PFS was measured to the date of first
clinical progression or death from any cause, unless the
patient was progression-free at the time of last contact, in
which case PFI was measured to the date of last contact.
All participants were followed up after treatment, and the

In vitro transwell invasion assays
The transwell chambers used for invasion assays
contained polycarbonate filters (8-µm pore size; BD
Biosciences) whose upper surfaces were coated with
a growth factor-reduced Matrigel matrix. Medium
containing 10% fetal bovine serum was placed in the
lower chambers to act as a chemoattractant. Cells (2 × 104
in 500 µL serum-free medium) were placed in the upper
chamber and incubated at 37°C for 20 hours. The cells
that penetrated the Matrigel-coated filter were counted
in 15 randomly selected fields, and the mean number of
cells per field was recorded. Each assay was performed on
duplicate filters, and each experiment was repeated twice.

IHC and grading of FOXM1 expression levels

CONFLICT OF INTEREST

FOXM1 protein expression was assessed via IHC
as previously described [27]. Briefly, IHC was performed
on formaldehyde-fixed, deparaffinized tissue sections
after microwave-enhanced epitope retrieval according
to the standard automated IHC procedure (Ventana
XT autostainer). Sections were incubated with mouse
monoclonal anti-FOXM1 antibody (Abnova Corporation)
was applied at a dilution of 1:50 phosphate-buffered saline
(negative control). Staining was scored by an investigator
unaware of the corresponding clinical outcome as follows:
grade 0 = negative; grade 1 = weak; grade 2 = moderate;
and grade 3 = strong (Fig. 11A). Grades 1-3 were
considered “positive” for expression, while grade 0 was
considered “negative”.
