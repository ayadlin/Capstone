BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to explore the relationship between icotinib hydrochloride exposure and therapeutic effects in Chinese patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were treated with icotinib hydrochloride.
METHODS: A total of 30 patients with NSCLC who were treated with icotinib hydrochloride were chosen from a single-center, openlabel, phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial. Different doses of icotinib hydrochloride were administered orally for 28 consecutive days
in different groups until disease progression or unacceptable toxicities occurred. Blood samples were collected during the first treatment cycle (day 1-28) for the pharmacokinetic analysis. Tumor responses were assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). The plasma concentrations of icotinib hydrochloride were assessed by liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry. RESULTS: Thirty patients with a median age of 56 years old (50% of whom were female) were enrolled. For singledose treatment, the plasma pharmacokinetics demonstrated a median time to maximum concentration of 0.5 to 4 hours and a mean
terminal elimination half-life of 6.2163.44 hours at the 150-mg dose and 10.1612.18 hours at the 200-mg dose. For multiple-dose treatment, the last measurable concentration (Clast) was 7086368.67 ng/mL at the 150-mg every 12 hours, 782.736618.18 ng/mL at the
200-mg every 12 hours, and 11626658.44 ng/mL at the 125-mg every 8 hours; the under the concentration curve from time 0 to Clast
was 14.562.43 hour*mg/mL, 13.262.5 hour*mg/mL, and 12.1962.47 hour*mg/mL, respectively. At the dose of 150 mg every 12 hours, 1
patient with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletion achieved a complete response for 10 months; another
patient who carried the EGFR exon 19 deletion achieved stable disease for 6 months. Univariate analysis demonstrated that the time
to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) after a single dose of icotinib hydrochloride was significantly correlated with the overall survival (OS) (Spearman correlation coefficient, 0.441; P 5 .012). The disease control rate was correlated with Tmax after a single dose
(Spearman correlation coefficient, 0.518; P 5 .011). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the area under the concentration-time
curve from 0 to last determination time and the area under the curve from 0 to infinite time after a single dose of icotinib hydrochloride were correlated with OS (P 5 .037 and .042, respectively). The Clast was found to affect progression-free survival (P 5 .016). Stratification of these patients according to smoking status indicated significant correlation between OS and the area under the
concentration-time curve from 0 to last determination time (Spearman correlation coefficient, -0.709; P 5 .015). CONCLUSIONS:
Patients with a longer Tmax and higher exposure might experience longer OS and a higher disease control rate. In addition, the
increased Clast might prolong the progressive-free survival of patients. However, the relationships between EGFR mutation, pharmacoC 2015 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Icotinib hydrochloride (4-[(3-ethynylphenyl] amino]-6,7-benzo-12-crown-4-quinazoline hydrochloride) (Fig. 1)1,2 is a
novel, orally administered, reversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitor and is the first
homegrown anticancer drug designed, synthesized, and screened by Beta Pharma (Zhejiang, China).2,3 It was found to inhibit the growth of human tumor cell lines that overexpress EGFR4 (half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] of
1 lmol/L for A431 cells) and the growth of A431 (human epithelial carcinomas) in a nude mouse xenograft model (inhibition rate of 60.1% at a dose level of 60 mg/kg). In preclinical trials,3,5 the IC50 of icotinib hydrochloride inhibiting
EGFR was 0.5 nM, and the agent only inhibited EGFR and its mutants among 88 kinases. In a phase 1/2a trial,3 oral icotinib hydrochloride was generally well tolerated, with slight and reversible adverse events, and demonstrated positive clinical antitumor activities in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study institution6 also
published a report indicating that doses of oral icotinib hydrochloride of 125 mg every 8 hours, 150 mg every 12 hours,

and 200 mg every 12 hours were all safe. A head-to-head
phase 3 clinical trial1 comparing the roles of icotinib
hydrochloride (at a dose of 125 mg every 8 hours) and
gefitinib (at a dose of 250 mg every day) in the treatment
of patients with NSCLC in China has suggested that icotinib hydrochloride has efficacy similar to that of gefitinib,
with much better safety profiles. Furthermore, it is superior to gefitinib in terms of treatment cost. Recently, a retrospective
study7
demonstrated
that
icotinib
hydrochloride is active in the treatment of patients with
NSCLC both in the first-line or second-line and/or thirdline setting. Because of its pharmacological effects, icotinib hydrochloride was approved in June 2011 by the
China Food and Drug Administration for the treatment
of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC
who failed to respond to at least 1 previous chemotherapy
regimen. The recommended dose1,3 of icotinib hydrochloride was 625 mg/day (125 mg every 8 hours), and the
therapeutic window8 was reported to be between 100 mg
and 600 mg (without any adverse effects reported).
To date, although icotinib hydrochloride has completed phase 1 trials3,6 and full pharmacokinetic parameter profiles3,6 have been published, the question of
whether exposure to icotinib hydrochloride would influence the therapeutic effects remain unknown. In the current study, using analysis of data from a single-center,
open-label, phase 1 clinical trial conducted in the study
institution from August 2007 to April 2009, we explored
the relationship between icotinib hydrochloride exposure
and clinical outcomes of a single dose or the administration for 28 consecutive days among 30 Chinese patients
with NSCLC.

single-center, open-label, phase 1 dose escalation clinical
trial in the study center comprised the current study. The
clinical trial was approved by the Ethics Committee at
Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) (No.
2006L01414). All patients provided written informed
consent before participation in the study. Patients were eligible for enrollment if they had histologically confirmed,
locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic NSCLC and if
they had received cytotoxic chemotherapy for advanced
disease. The last chemotherapy administration must have
ended at least 3 weeks before enrollment on the current
study and the patient must have recovered from any chemotherapeutically toxic effects. Other inclusion criteria
included 1 measurable lesion as assessed according to the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST;
version 1.1)9; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status (ECOG PS)10 of 0 or 1; an estimated
life expectancy of 12 weeks; age 18 years; and
adequate bone marrow function (an absolute neutrophil
count 1.53109/L, platelet count 903109/L, and hemoglobin 9 g/dL), hepatic function (bilirubin 1.5
times the upper limit of normal and aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase 3.0 times the upper
limits of normal [aspartate aminotransferase and alanine
aminotransferase were permitted to be 5 times the upper
limit of normal in the presence of liver metastasis]), and
renal function (endogenous creatinine clearance rate 60
mL/minute based on the standard Cockcroft-Gault formula or serum creatinine 1.5 times the upper limit of
normal); and no malabsorption or other gastrointestinal
disorders or any biliary tract diseases that may affect drug
absorption. Patients were excluded if they had received
any previous human epidermal growth factor receptor/
EGFR inhibitors or other molecular target drugs and if
they had serious or severe hypersensitivity reactions to icotinib hydrochloride or any of its excipients. Other exclusion criteria included the use of phenytoin sodium,
carbamazepine, rifampicin, phenobarbital, or St John’s
wort and any unapproved drugs taken within 30 days
before enrolling on the current study; central nervous system metastasis or spinal cord compression; a history of interstitial lung disease, drug-induced interstitial lung
disease, radiation pneumonitis, or idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis; and women who were pregnant or lactating.
Patients could withdraw from the trial if they experienced
clinical or radiographic tumor progression or if they
developed other diseases that affected the evaluation of efficacy and toxicities or if they were required to terminate
this trial. Other withdrawal criteria included a serious or

Study Design and Patients Selection

A dose escalation method was used in this single-center,
open-label phase 1 clinical trial. Six dosing groups were
designed: 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg, 250 mg, 300 mg,
and 400 mg administered twice daily. A dose level of 125
mg given 3 times a day was added on the basis of another
phase 1 trial,4 which was performed in another clinical
institute. A total of 12 patients were expected within each
group, and it was expected that 8 patients would complete
the trial. Ten to 15 patients were wanted for the plus dose
level of 125 mg 3 times a day.
At the beginning of this trial, using a parallel randomization method, we set the group of patients receiving 150
mg every 12 hours6 as the starting-dose group. In this
group, when the number of patients who dropped out due
to safety concerns was >30% of the total number of the enrolled patients (12 patients), a group of patients receiving
100 mg every 12 hours was used; if the number of the dropout patients due to safety concerns was >30% of the total
number of the enrolled patients (12 patients), a group of
patients receiving 200 mg every 12 hours was used instead.
Thus, the dose was escalated to 400 mg every 12 hours, or
until reaching the dosing group in which the number of the
dropout patients was >30% due to a certain reason.
Each patients received oral administration of a single
dose of the drug under fasting conditions on day 1. Blood
samples were collected within 72 hours to obtain plasma
pharmacokinetics data. From day 4 to day 31, a morning
dose and a second dose approximately 12 hours later in
the evening were administered, 2 hours after a meal or 1
hour before eating, twice per day. In the group receiving a
dose of 125 mg, patients received icotinib hydrochloride
3 times per day on an empty stomach. Patients continued
to receive treatment at the same dose level as long as icotinib hydrochloride was tolerated and there was no evidence
of disease progression.
Toxicities were graded based on the National Cancer
Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0). A
dose-limiting toxicity was defined as icotinib
hydrochloride-related grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity. At the scrutiny of the investigator, the patients
decreased the dose due to safety concerns. If >30% of
patients in one dosing group experienced a toxicity of
grade 3, this dose level was deemed intolerable and the
dose escalation was stopped immediately. The treatment
had to be stopped, and corresponding symptomatic management provided.

Study Drug and Its Specifications, Batch
Number, and Administration Method

The study drug is icotinib hydrochloride, which is administered as pink and biconvex tablets (125 mg, 150 mg, and
200 mg) for oral administration. Its shelf life is 2 years.
The manufacturer is Beta Pharm Ltd, Zhejiang Province,
China. The drug is stored at room temperature. Its specifications and batch number are shown in Table 1.
Icotinib hydrochloride tablets at a dose of every 12
hours or every 8 hours were orally administered before
meals for 28 consecutive days, with an interval of approximately 12 hours between 2 doses or an interval of approximately 8 hours between 3 doses. The drug had to be
administered under fasting conditions (ie, the patients
must have fasted 2 hours before and 1 hour after drug
administration).
Collection of Biological Samples

Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed during cycle 1
(day 1-28). Several blood samples were collected to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters in each dosing
group. On day 1, blood samples were collected before
drug administration and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60,
and 72 hours after drug administration. On days 11, 18,
and 26, blood samples were collected before drug administration. On day 31, blood samples were collected before
drug administration and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 12 hours after
the first dosing. A venous blood sample (3 mL each time)
was obtained from a vein in the forearm and then stored
in heparinized evacuated tubes. The sample was then centrifuged at 3000 revolutions per minute for 10 minutes.
The harvested plasma fraction was equally divided into 2
parts and stored at -708C for further determination. Each
tube was labeled with the study name, contents, patient
number, and sample number. Sample analysis was performed in the laboratory of the Clinical Pharmacology
Center at PUMCH in strict accordance with its standard
operating procedures. The plasma concentrations of

time (AUC0-last), and area under the concentration-time
curve from 0 to infinite time (AUC0-1) were evaluated.
Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using a noncompartmental model with the Phoenix WinNonlin software (version 6.3; Pharsight Corporation, Cary, NC). Data
were mainly analyzed using descriptive statistics.
Statistical Analysis

Efficacy Evaluation

Tumor assessment was performed during screening (within
28 days before study entry as the baseline), and subsequently every 4 weeks for the first 2 cycles (8 weeks) and
then at the posttreatment follow-up visits (which were
scheduled every 8 weeks) until RECIST-defined PD. In all
patients, brain and bone screening were repeated every 12
weeks to monitor for new lesions. All examinations had to
be completed in PUMCH on an inpatient or outpatient
basis. The primary efficacy endpoint was the overall
response rate (ORR, which included complete response
[CR] and partial response [PR]) and disease control rate
(DCR, which included CR, PR, and stable disease [SD]) at
the first 2 cycles (8 weeks). The progression-free survival
(PFS), which was defined as the time from the first administration until PD or death, and the overall survival (OS),
which was defined as the time from the first administration
until death, were also assessed. Tumor measurements were
evaluated using RECIST criteria (version 3.0) for CR, PR,
SD, and PD. CR and PR required confirmation 4 weeks
after the initial response observation.
Safety and tolerability evaluations were performed
during each cycle. All patients receiving at least 1 dose of
icotinib hydrochloride were considered assessable for
safety and tolerability. Before therapy and on days 8, 15,
and 22 and every 4 weeks, a complete history was taken,
physical examination performed, and the ECOG PS evaluated. A full blood cell count, urinalysis, serum biochemistry, coagulation screen, bleeding time, creatine kinase
level, lactate dehydrogenase level, and electrocardiogram
were assessed.
After 2 treatment cycles (8 weeks), if the patients
were found to have benefited from treatment, icotinib
hydrochloride was administered until PD.
Analysis of the Pharmacokinetic Data

The following pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated in the current study: maximum (peak) plasma
concentration (Cmax), time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax), and last measurable concentration (Clast).
In all the dosing groups, the Tmax, Cmax, Clast, area under

Quantitative indicators were compared using the Student t test between 2 groups and the chi-square test
among 3 groups. The Fisher exact test was used for the
comparison of nominal category data among groups,
and the rank sum test was used for the comparison of ordered category data. The Spearman rank correlation
coefficient was applied to analyze the nonparametric correlation between 2 variables. The median PFS and median OS were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier
method, and the survival curves were drawn. Univariate
analysis and multivariate analysis of the PFS were conducted using the log-rank test and Cox regression analysis. A 2-tailed P value <.05 was considered statistically
significant. All statistical analysis was performed using
SPSS statistical software (version 21.0; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY).
RESULTS
Demographic Data

A total of 30 patients with NSCLC were enrolled from
August 2007 to April 2009. The main characteristics of
the 30 patients are reported in Table 2. EGFR and K-ras
gene status was assessed in 8 patients (27%) and 9
patients (30%), respectively, due to insufficient amounts
of tumor cells or poor-quality DNA in the remaining
specimens. Five patients (16.7%) had sensitive mutations
(3 cases of exon 19 deletion and 2 cases of exon 21 L858R
mutation). No drug resistance mutation was detected.
One patient (11.1%) was found to be positive for the Kras mutation.
All 30 patients had received at least 1 prior regimen
of chemotherapy.
Grouping

During the first treatment cycle, 1 patient in group B
developed drug-related interstitial lung disease (grade 5).
Thus, the investigator decided to end the dose escalation
and a dose of 200 mg every 12 hours was regarded as the
largest dose in this trial. As per the protocol, 3 dose levels
were evaluated. Thirty patients were assigned into 3 dose
level groups: group A received 150 mg every 12 hours,
group B received 200 mg every 12 hours, and group C

of the clinical trial in each group are shown in Table 3. No
patients withdrew because of adverse events after the first treatment period of 4 weeks. No dose reductions were required
because of dose-related adverse events. Thus, among the 30 enrolled patients, all completed the icotinib hydrochloride monotherapy pharmacokinetic trial (day 1) and received the efficacy

hydrochloride ranged from 6 hours to 10 hours across the
dose cohorts. The clearance/bioavailability of icotinib
hydrochloride demonstrated moderate interindividual variability and the mean standard deviation of clearance/bioavailability on day 1 for icotinib hydrochloride doses of 150
mg/day and 200 mg/day were 13.364.78 and 19.969.92,
respectively.
Multiple-dose pharmacokinetic data at steady state
were analyzed at cycle 1 (day 4-31) (Table 4). Steady-state
plasma levels were achieved after 7 to 11 days of drug
administration. For all cohorts, the Cmax increased approximately in dose proportionately up to the 400-mg daily (200
mg every 12 hours) dose levels. For twice-a-day cohorts, the
Clast AUC0-last was similar for the groups receiving 150 mg
every 12 hours and 200 mg every 12 hours, whereas for the
cohort receiving the dose 3 times a day, the Clast was higher
than that noted among the twice-per-day cohorts. Multipledose exposure was found to be no more than 2-fold greater
than single-dose exposure across the entire dose range,
which suggested that there was no major accumulation of
icotinib hydrochloride after repeated daily administration.
The mean plasma concentration-time curves after the
administration of a single dose and of the steady state are
shown in Figures 2 and 3. The more detailed pharmacokinetic data are presented in Table 4.

Clinical Efficacy

No patients were still alive as of May 1, 2012. The median
follow-up was 14.3 months. The primary efficacy endpoint of ORR (including CR and PR) lasting >8 weeks
was 26.7% (8 of 30 patients), and the DCR (including
CR, PR, and SD) lasting >8 weeks was 73.3% (22 of 30
patients). One patient who achieved a CR was treated
with 150 mg every 12 hours. One of the 7 patients who

Original Article

achieved a PR was treated with the dose of 200 mg every
12 hours, 2 patients were treated with the dose of 125 mg
every 8 hours, and the remaining 4 patients were treated
with 150 mg every 12 hours.
The median PFS for all patients was 6.0 months
(95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.5-9.5 months) and
the median OS was 14.0 months (95% CI, 8.3-19.8
months). The PFS and OS demonstrated no significant
difference among these 3 dosing groups (P 5 .266 and
P 5 .365, respectively). Both the antitumor activity
(including ORR and DCR) and survival (including PFS
and OS) are shown in Table 5 and Figure 4.

and day 30 administration of icotinib hydrochloride in the
plasma of patients after multiple doses of 150 mg every 12
hours (group A; 10 patients), 200 mg every 12 hours (group B;
8 patients), and 125 mg every 8 hours (group C; 8 patients).
Concentrations were expressed as ng/mL in the plasma.

The relationship between icotinib hydrochloride exposure
and therapeutic effects was assessed. On univariate analysis, the tumor response (ORR and DCR) and survival
(PFS and OS) were not found to be affected by sex, age,
stage of disease (according to the 7th edition of American
Joint Committee on Cancer, AJCC), pathological type,
ECOG PS, or smoking history (all P >.05). On univariate analysis, the longer Tmax in steady state after the
administration of icotinib hydrochloride predicted better
disease control (Spearman correlation coefficient, 0.518;
P 5 .011) (Table 6). Four patients experienced 4 hours to
Cmax, which was the longest Tmax across all cohorts; all
achieved disease control lasting >8 weeks. On the contrary, those patients who experienced the shortest Tmax
(0.5 hours) demonstrated PD within 4 weeks. On Cox
regression analysis, patients who had a higher Clast of
single-dose icotinib hydrochloride were found to have a
longer PFS (P 5 .016). In addition, patients who had a

EGFR Gene Mutations and Pharmacokinetics

The results of previous trials demonstrated that the therapeutic effects of icotinib hydrochloride were highly dependent on EGFR gene mutations, which represent the
main predictors of tyrosine kinase inhibitor efficacy.
Therefore, we analyzed the current study data according
to EGFR mutational status.
Three of the 30 patients in the current study (10%)
carried an exon 19 deletion point mutation. The ORR
was 33.3% (1 of 3 patients) and the DCR was 100%. The
median PFS was 6.0 months (95% CI, 3.9-8.2 months)
and the median OS was 14.5 months (95% CI, 12.8-16.1
months). Two of the 30 patients (6.7%) were found to
carry an exon 21 L858R mutation. One of these patients
(50%) achieved a PR, with a PFS of 12.9 months and an
OS of 27.1 months. The other patient died of PD at 4
weeks after the first day of icotinib hydrochloride
administration.
On univariate analysis, the gene mutations demonstrated no significant correlation with the pharmacokinetic parameters (including Tmax, Cmax, Clast, and AUC)

DISCUSSION
After previous clinical trials5,8 proved that icotinib hydrochloride had a dose-dependent antitumor effect, the
results of the current study further elucidated that the
pharmacokinetic variability of icotinib hydrochloride
might account for the different outcomes noted after
treatment among patients with NSCLC. Icotinib hydrochloride was reported to demonstrate poor solubility in
water, and was highly permeable into tissue, so that it can
easily pass through the cell membrane and blood-brain
barrier.11 The delayed time to Cmax noted previously12
might be caused by a slight saturated absorption rate,
thereby prolonging the drug concentration entering into
cell, which predicts a high dose of icotinib hydrochloride
in tumor cells. More icotinib hydrochloride entering into
the tumor cells could increase the patients’ lifespan and
cause a rise in the antitumor activity. In the current study,
patients with a longer time to Cmax and higher exposure
might have experienced a longer OS and higher DCR.
Meanwhile, the Clast appeared to increase dose proportionally in the dose range of 125 to 200 mg, leading to the
belief that an increased Clast might prolong the PFS of
patients. Similarly, a case report13 described a 46-year-old
nonsmoking man who achieved a dramatic and durable
response to high-dose icotinib hydrochloride (375 mg
administered 3 times daily for 6 months! 500 mg every
8 hours!625 mg every 8 hours for 1 month). The treatment extended the life of the patient for 1 additional year.
Icotinib hydrochloride is similar to erlotinib and gefitinib
with regard to its chemical structure and mechanisms of
action. In 2011, Zhao et al14 found that the minimum
steady-state plasma gefitinib concentration of 200 ng/
mL was significantly correlated with the efficacy in
patients with advanced NSCLC (P 5 .009); multivariate
3154

Cox regression analysis demonstrated that the level of
minimum steady-state plasma gefitinib concentration was
an independent prognostic factor of OS (P 5 .007). In
2014, Tiseo et al15 found significant correlations between
blood erlotinib concentrations on day 7 and the antitumor efficacy of this drug. Other studies16-18 also have confirmed that the plasma gefitinib and erlotinib exposures
were significantly correlated with clinical efficacies. The
pharmacokinetic data may predict the therapeutic exposure, to some extent prolonging survival and increasing
antitumor activity. The special pharmacokinetics model
deserves to be developed in future clinical trials.
The clinical benefit of icotinib hydrochloride was
deemed to occur over the dose range from 100 mg to 600
mg per day.3,5,19 The preclinical animal efficacy data5
suggested that the dose of 150 mg twice a day would be an
appropriate dose that should provide good antitumor activity, and therefore we selected the dose of 150 mg every
12 hours as the initial dose level. In the current study, a
single dose of oral icotinib hydrochloride was absorbed
swiftly: the mean Tmax was 2 hours (range, 0.5-4 hours)
and the terminal half-life ranged from 6 to 12 hours,
which is consistent with the results of another phase 1
trial3 performed in another clinical institute. It is suggested that oral icotinib hydrochloride is appropriately
administered 2 or 3 times a day.
According to the assessment at 8 weeks of treatment,
1 patient achieved a CR and the ORR was 26.7%. SD was
noted in 14 patients, and the DCR was 73.3%. The clinical outcome results of the current study are similar to
those of the phase 3 ICOGEN trial, in which the ORR
and DCR were 27.6% and 75.4%, respectively.1 In the
ICOGEN trial, the median PFS was 4.6 months and the
median OS was 13.3 months.1 However, in the current
trial, the PFS and OS were longer than those reported in
the ICOGEN trial,1 which may have resulted in the good
ECOG PS of 0 to 1 noted in the current study patients. In
addition, we believed that there might be some deviations
in the current trial due to the relatively small sample.
In never-smoking patients, the incidence of EGFR
mutations was nearly 50%,20,21 which many investigators
view as a surrogate marker for erlotinib and gefitinib.20,2224
In addition, some trials25,26 elucidated that smoking
status is a predictor of survival. The stratification of
patients in the current study according to smoking status
indicated significant correlation between AUC0-last and
OS (Spearman correlation coefficient, -0.709; P 5 .015).
Among the smokers, patients with smaller AUC0-last values were found to have longer OS. Because AUC reflects
the amount of drug entering the blood circulation, we

currently are not able to rule out the possibility that smoking affects the absorption and distribution of a drug in the
human body and thus affects the final results.
After screening the 30 patients, EGFR mutations
were detected in 16.7% of all patients, a finding that was
limited by the small tumor samples and smoking history,
and obviously lower than the reported data in Asian individuals (30%-40%).1,27 Exposure of icotinib hydrochloride did not appear to be significantly different between
patients carried EGFR mutations or not. Although it was
previously reported that patients with sensitive EGFR
mutations are likely to have better responses, especially
those with an exon 19 deletion,28,29 in the current study
data, the tumor response of patients with the exon 19 deletion was found to be no better than that of those with
the L858R mutation (P>.05). Considering the small
sample size of the current study, in which only 5 patients
were found to have an EGFR mutation and only 2
patients carried the EGFR L858R mutation, further studies are necessary to explore this finding.
Although we tried to discover the relationship
between icotinib hydrochloride exposure and clinical outcome, there were several limitations to the current study.
First, the sample size was too small, which may have some
influence on the assessment of survival and antitumor activity. The small number of patients treated at each dose
level and the limitation of the maximum level of hydrochloride dose both imposed restrictions on the pharmacokinetics. Second, data regarding EGFR were not able to
be fully obtained because of clinical limits, thereby leading
us to inappropriately analyze the relationship between
EGFR mutation, exposure, and therapeutic effects. In the
future, we will attempt to establish a pharmacokinetics/
pharmacodynamic model and determine more potential
uses of icotinib hydrochloride, which is of benefit for both
its development and clinical use. Third, according to
Ruan et al,30 CYP2C19 polymorphism, the mainly metabolic enzyme of icotinib hydrochloride, can have an influence on biotransformation from icotinib hydrochloride to
M24 and M26. However, all information and clinical
data in this trial were obtained from the medical records,
and we were unable to obtain information regarding the
genetic polymorphism of CYP2C19.
The results of the current study illustrated that
patients with a longer time to Cmax and higher exposure
might have longer OS and a higher DCR. In addition, the
increased Clast might prolong the PFS of patients. However, the relationships between EGFR mutation, pharmacokinetics, and clinical outcomes require further research.
