Abstract
The effect of the antidiabetic drug metformin on tumor
growth was investigated using the paired isogenic colon
cancer cell lines HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53 / . Treatment with metformin selectively suppressed the tumor growth
of HCT116 p53 / xenografts. Following treatment with
metformin, we detected increased apoptosis in p53 / tumor
sections and an enhanced susceptibility of p53 / cells to
undergo apoptosis in vitro when subject to nutrient deprivation. Metformin is proposed to function in diabetes treatment as an indirect activator of AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK). Treatment with AICAR, another AMPK activator,
also showed a selective ability to inhibit p53 / tumor growth
in vivo. In the presence of either of the two drugs, HCT116
p53+/+ cells, but not HCT116 p53 / cells, activated autophagy.
A similar p53-dependent induction of autophagy was observed
when nontransformed mouse embryo fibroblasts were treated.
Treatment with either metformin or AICAR also led to
enhanced fatty acid B-oxidation in p53+/+ MEFs, but not in
p53 / MEFs. However, the magnitude of induction was
significantly lower in metformin-treated cells, as metformin
treatment also suppressed mitochondrial electron transport.
Metformin-treated cells compensated for this suppression
of oxidative phosphorylation by increasing their rate of
glycolysis in a p53-dependent manner. Together, these data
suggest that metformin treatment forces a metabolic conversion that p53 / cells are unable to execute. Thus, metformin is selectively toxic to p53-deficient cells and provides a
potential mechanism for the reduced incidence of tumors
observed in patients being treated with metformin. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The biguanide metformin is the most widely used drug for
treatment of type 2 diabetes (1, 2). The primary systemic effect of
metformin is the lowering of blood glucose levels. The effects of
metformin on blood glucose has been explained through reduced
hepatic gluconeogenesis and increased glucose uptake in skeletal
muscles (3, 4). Metformin treatment leads to activation of AMP-

activated protein kinase (AMPK) in vitro and in vivo (5–7). The
molecular mechanisms by which metformin leads to AMPK
activation are poorly understood. Nevertheless, through activation
of AMPK, metformin treatment decreases the expression of gluconeogenic genes and increases fatty acid oxidation in hepatocytes
(7–9). In addition, studies in mice lacking expression of LKB1 in
the liver show that the glucose-lowering effect of metformin is
dependent on the LKB1/AMPK pathway (10).
Beyond the reported effects of metformin on insulin-responsive
tissues, little is known about the effects of metformin on other cell
types. However, AMPK is a intracellular fuel sensor that regulates
cellular homeostasis in response to energy stress in all eukaryotic
cells (11). Physiologically, AMPK is activated upon increase in the
AMP/ATP ratio within the cell and induces a cellular response characterized by an up-regulation of catabolic pathways that generate ATP and by a down-regulation of ATP-consuming processes.
The ability of cells to maintain a proper supply of ATP and intracellular metabolites is critical for survival. It has been suggested
that AMPK activation promotes the survival of bioenergetically
stressed stromal cells in part through p53 activation (12). Recent
reports have linked p53 to metabolic regulation. Matoba et al.
identified p53 as a regulator of SCO2 (synthesis of cytochrome c
oxidase 2). Loss of p53 decreases SCO2 activity and reduces the
coupling efficiency of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
(13–15). In addition, TIGAR (TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis
regulator) has been identified as a target of p53. By lowering the
level of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, TIGAR redirects glucose into
the pentose phosphate pathway, thus enhancing NADPH production and increasing the capacity of cells to handle redox stress
(13). p53 induction leads to activation of the autophagy pathway
through DRAM (damage-regulated autophagy modulator), a
lysosomal protein required for fusion of autophagosomes (16). In
turn, autophagy has been shown to be required for cells to survive
growth factors withdrawal and/or nutrient deprivation (17). The
ability of p53 to induce autophagy has been reported to depend on
AMPK (18).
Recently, two reports link the treatment of metformin with a
lower risk of cancer in patients. Evans et al. (19) did a pilot observational study reporting that among patients with type 2 diabetes,
those treated with metformin have a lower incidence of cancer
compared with those untreated. In an independent study, using
administrative databases of a population-based cohort, Bowker
et al. (20) reported that type 2 diabetes patients who use metformin
have a lower cancer-related mortality compared with those that
use sulfonylureas or insulin. Despite the wide use of metformin in
patients and the link between cellular metabolism and cancer,
there is no clear understanding of the role of metformin on tumor
growth. This observation, together with the increasing evidence

of the role of p53 in regulation of cellular metabolism, prompt
us to investigate the effects of metformin in correlation with the
tumor-suppressor p53 on both cellular metabolism and tumor
growth.
Here, we report that treatment with either AMPK activators
metformin or AICAR selectively inhibits tumor growth of p53deficient colon cancer cells in vivo. We show that cells treated with
metformin or AICAR activate a p53-dependent metabolic response
that contributes to continued in vivo and in vitro cell survival.
These findings highlight p53 as a required component of an adaptive metabolic response that promotes cell survival after systemic
treatment with metformin or AICAR.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and cell culture. The colon cancer HCT116 p53+/+ and p53 /
cell lines have been described previously. HCT116 cell lines were maintained in McCoy’s 5A supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
100 units/mL penicillin, 100 Ag/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 2 mmol/L
+/+
L-glutamine. MEF AMPKa
and AMPKa / cells were described previously
+/+
(21). MEF AMPKa
and AMPKa / cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 Ag/mL streptomycin,
and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine. Cell concentration was determined with a
Coulter Z2 particle analyzer. Cell viability was determined by the exclusion of 2 Ag/mL propidium iodide (Invitrogen) by a LSR flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences).
Reagents. AICAR was obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc.
Metformin, fatty acid–free bovine serum albumin (BSA), [9,10-3H]palmitate,
etomoxir, and Dowex 1 8-200 ion exchange resin were obtained from
Sigma. Rapamycin was purchased from Calbiochem.
Mice xenografts. Early-passage HCT116 cells were harvested, washed
twice in PBS, and resuspended in 200 AL PBS before being inoculated s.c. at
both flanks (p53+/+ cells on the left flank and p53 / cells on the right
flanks) of nude mice (6- to 8-week-old females; Charles River). Metformin
(250 mg  kg body weight) or AICAR (500 mg  kg body weight) was
dissolved in 200 AL PBS and administered daily with i.p. injections. The
control group received vehicle only (200 AL PBS). Tumor volume (mm3) was
measured twice a week and estimated from caliper measurements using
the formula p/6  A  B 2 (A is larger diameter, B is smaller diameter). For
the experiment in Figs. 1 and 2, samples are as follows: for metformintreated mice, n = 6; for AICAR-treated mice, n = 5; and for PBS treated mice,
n = 4. The experiment was repeated four times with a total of n = 29 for
metformin-treated mice, n = 24 for AICAR-treated mice, and n = 28 for
PBS-treated mice. Statistical analysis was done using paired two-tailed
Student’s t test. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania.
Infections. The pEGFP-LC3 construct (kindly provided by Tamotsu
Toshimori, National Institute of Genetics, Mashima-Shizuoka, Japan) was
previously described. The p53+/+GFP-LC3 and p53 / GFP-LC3 mouse
embryonic fibroblast cell lines were created by retroviral transduction of
parental cell lines with MIGR1-GFP-LC3 and selected for green fluorescent
protein (GFP)–positive clones by MoFlow.
Western blot analysis. Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation
assay buffer containing protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Applied
Science) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails I and II (Sigma). Protein
concentrations were determined using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce
Biotechnology). Equal amounts of total protein (15 Ag) were resolved on
4% to 12% NuPage Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Nitrocellulose
membranes were blocked in PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk and
0.1% Tween 20 with the following antibodies: anti–phospho-Ser79 Acetyl
CoA Carboxylase (Upstate), anti–phospho-Ser15 p53 (Cell Signaling
Technology), or anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Anti-LC3 antibody
was raised in rabbits against the peptide MPSEKTFKQRRTFEQRVC (Quality
Control Biochemicals). Bands were detected using horseradish peroxidase–
labeled secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence detection
kit (Amersham).

Fatty acid oxidation assay. To measure fatty acid oxidation, we
modified an assay in which oxidation of [9,10-3H]palmitate results in
formation of 3H2O. Briefly, cells were seeded in six-well plates at 3  105 per
well in triplicate and incubated overnight in 1 mL medium containing
3 ACi/mL [9,10-3H]palmitate (70 nmol/L), bound to 10 Amol/L BSA, in the
presence or absence of 2 mmol/L metformin or 1 mmol/L AICAR. Tritiated
water was recovered by ion exchange treatment on Dowex 1 8-200
columns. Supernatants were applied to 3 mL Dowex 1 8-200 columns and
eluted with 2 mL water. 3H2O was quantified by liquid scintillation
counting. Fatty acid oxidation rates are shown as CPT-1–dependent
oxidation. Counts due to nonspecific oxidation, as shown by inability to
be inhibited by 60 Amol/L etomoxir, were subtracted from total counts.
Data are normalized to cell number (22).
Rate of oxygen consumption in intact cells. Measurements of oxygen
consumption of whole cells were done as described previously (23). Briefly,
HCT116 p53+/+ and p53 / cells were incubated in medium with or without 2 mmol/L metformin for 20 h. Following incubation, 4  106 cells were
resuspended in 200 AL medium with or without metformin and analyzed by
using a water-jacketed, airtight 3-mL chamber with a polarographic oxygen
electrode. Measurements were made at 37jC with constant stirring.
Immunofluorescence. Cells were cultured on glass coverslips in sixwell plates, washed once with PBS, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for
30 min. Coverslips were mounted using Immu-Mount (Thermo Shandon)
and images were captured using a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope. For
quantification of autophagic cells, cells with >10 GFP-LC3 punctuate dots
were considered positive. Data obtained from counting triplicates of
100 cells was average (mean F SD).
Electron microscopy. Tumors were resected from mice on day 14 after
initiation of treatment. Tumors were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde/2%
formaldehyde with 0.1 mol/L sodium cacodylate and stored at 4jC until
embedding. Tumor samples were postfixed with 2% osmium tetroxide
followed by an increasing gradient dehydration step using ethanol and
propylene oxide. Tumors were then embedded in LX-112 medium (Ladd)
and sections were cut ultrathin (90 nm), placed on uncoated copper grids,
and stained with 0.2% lead citrate and 1% uranyl acetate. Images were
examined with JEOL-1010 electron microscope (JEOL) at 80 kV. For
quantification of autophagic cells, positive cells were counted from a
minimum of 30 independent cells.
Glucose and lactate assays. p53+/+ and p53 / cell lines were cultured
in complete medium 10% FCS in the absence or presence of different
concentration of metformin. After 48 h, media from samples were collected
and analyzed for glucose and lactate concentration using colorimetric kits
according to manufacturer’s instructions (CMA/Microdialysis).
Terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase–mediated nick-end
labeling assay. Tumors were excised at day 6 of treatments, formalin fixed,
and embedded in paraffin. Sections were cut at 5 Am and deparaffinized and
dehydrated before treatment. The assay was done using the terminal
deoxyribonucleotide transferase (TdT)–mediated nick-end labeling (TUNEL)
method (Biotin-16-dUTP, Boehringer-Mannheim; TdT, Amersham).

Results
Metformin and AICAR treatment inhibits growth of HCT116
p53 / xenografts in nude mice. To investigate whether the
antidiabetic drug metformin affects tumor growth, we used the
paired isogenic human colon carcinoma cell lines, HCT116 p53+/+
and p53 / . Nude mice were injected in the lateral side of the left
flank with HCT116 p53+/+ and of the right flank with p53 / cells.
Four days after injection, animals were treated with daily i.p.
injections of either metformin (250 mg  kg body weight) or
an equal volume of saline solution. Tumor progression was followed by measurements of tumor volume over time. As previously
reported, loss of wild-type p53 in a p53 / derivative of HCT116
accelerates tumorigenesis in untreated animals (Fig. 1A). However,
in mice treated with metformin, we measured a significant
reduction of growth of tumors from HCT116 p53 / cells when

Tumor Growth

Figure 1. Systemic treatment with the antidiabetic drug metformin selectively inhibits growth of human colon HCT116 p53 / tumor xenografts in nude mice. Each
nude mouse was s.c. injected with 3  106 HCT116 p53+/+ cells (on the left flank) and with 3  106 HCT116 p53 / cells (on the right flank). Mice bearing tumors
were treated daily with i.p. injections of metformin (250 mg  kg body weight; MET). The control group received equal volume (200 AL) of vehicle only (PBS ).
Treatment started 4 d after implantation (arrow ). Tumor volume was measured, at indicated time points, from xenografts derived from (A) p53 / or p53+/+ cells of
vehicle-treated mice, (B ) p53+/+ cells, and (C ) p53 / cells of mice treated with metformin or PBS. Tumor volumes were measured as indicated in Materials and
Methods. Points, mean; bars, SE. Data are representative of three independent experiments.

compared with the growth of the tumors from p53+/+ cells in the
opposite flank. After 1 month of treatment with metformin, the
average tumor volume of p53 / xenografts was >50% smaller than
p53 / xenografts from mice treated with vehicle control (Fig. 1C;
P < 0.01). Although a systemic effect of metformin on cell growth
was observed in p53 / xenografts, no significant difference in
tumor volumes were observed between metformin and controltreated mice bearing p53+/+ tumors (Fig. 1B).

Because the antidiabetic effects of metformin are AMPK
dependent (7), we next tested whether AICAR, a widely used
AMPK activator, could recapitulate these results. Similar results
were obtained when mice were injected daily with 500 mg  kg
of AICAR. Mice bearing HCT116 tumor xenografts were treated
with AICAR or PBS and tumor volume was measured over a period
of 35 days. Following AICAR treatment, average tumor volume was
reduced by 50% compared with vehicle-treated tumors in p53 /

xenografts (Fig. 2B). AICAR treatment resulted in no inhibition of
tumor growth in p53+/+ xenografts compared with vehicle
treatment (Fig. 2A). Although daily AICAR treatment had
significantly reduced tumor volume selectively in p53-deficient
tumors, no observable systemic toxicity was noted in p53+/+ tumors
of mice treated for 30 to 35 days (Fig. 2C).
Metformin induces cell death in p53-deficient HCT116 cells
under nutrient limitation. Tissue sections taken from the
xenografts at day 6 of treatment were next subjected to histologic
analysis. Apoptotic cells were observed in clusters in the p53 /
tumors treated with metformin, but were not observed in either the
PBS-treated p53 / tumors or in the p53+/+ tumors from either
PBS- or metformin-treated animals. TUNEL assay of the tumor
sections of xenografted regions of HCT116 p53 / cells showed
that these regions were composed of apoptotic cells and infiltrating
macrophages containing apoptotic nuclei. Only scattered TUNELpositive cells were seen in the PBS-treated tumors (Fig. 3A).
The fact that the cell death observed in the tumors was regional
suggested that this cell death might result from areas, which were
underperfused or at the border between vascularized zones. Tumor
cells in such regions might be either hypoxic and/or nutrient
deficient. To determine if the cell death correlated with such a
bioenergetic compromise, the ability of HCT116 p53+/+ and p53 /
cells to survive under nutrient deprivation was examined in vitro.
HCT116 cells were incubated in glucose-deficient medium or in
medium containing full glucose (25 mmol/L) and cell viability
was measured after 24 h of metformin treatment. The viability of
p53 / cells was significantly decreased compared with that of
p53+/+ cells when treated with metformin in the absence of glucose (Fig. 3B). There was no significant difference in the viability
of p53+/+ and p53 / cells treated with metformin when grown in
the presence of glucose.
Previously, we reported that cancer cells can maintain their
viability by switching from glucose catabolism to alternative energy
sources such as oxidation of fatty acids in response to glucose
limitation (24). We then tested whether during glucose deprivation
and metformin treatment, p53+/+ cells were relying on fatty acid

oxidation as their main fuel source for survival. We measured
viability of HCT116 p53+/+ and p53 / cells treated with metformin
during glucose deprivation when fatty acid oxidation was inhibited
by etomoxir, an inhibitor of CPT-1 (25). The addition of etomoxir
only slightly decreased the cell survival of both p53+/+ and p53 /
in cells treated with metformin in the absence of glucose,
suggesting that the catabolism of additional substrates such as
amino acids contributes to promoting cell survival in the absence
of glucose. There was no toxicity induced by etomoxir treatment in
cells grown in the presence of glucose (Fig. 3B).
Analysis of autophagic markers in p53+/+ and p53 / cells
after treatment with metformin or AICAR. In the absence of
growth factors or nutrient availability, autophagy is an essential
pathway for cell survival (26–28). To determine the level of
autophagy in the HCT116 xenografts, ultrathin sections of the
tumors resected from nude mice after 14 days of metformin
treatment were analyzed by electron microscopy. Photomicrographs show the presence of increased number of autophagosomes
in p53+/+ xenografts from metformin-treated animals compared
with p53+/+ tumors of control-treated mice (Fig. 4A). A significant
increase in the percentage of autophagosome-positive cells was
observe in p53+/+ tumors from mice treated with metformin
(Fig. 4B). In contrast, the percentage of autophagosome-positive
cells in p53-deficient xenografts from metformin-treated mice did
not differ from the percentage of autophagosome-positive cells
observed in control mice.
During autophagy, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3
(LC3) is specifically processed from a cytosolic full-length form
(LC3-I) to a cleaved membrane-bound form (LC3-II; ref. 29). As
an independent method to detect activation of autophagy, we
analyzed the appearance of LC3-II form in HCT116 p53+/+ and
p53 / cells by Western blot analysis. The conversion from the
LC3-I to the LC3-II form was markedly increased in p53+/+ cells
when compared with p53 / cells after treatment either with
metformin or AICAR (Fig. 4C), recapitulating the results observed
in vivo. It was recently reported that p53 is an AMPK target and
that activation of p53 induces autophagy in an AMPK-dependent

manner (18, 30). Therefore, we examined whether increased LC3-II
accumulation was associated with p53 activation. Coincident with
the appearance of the LC3-II form, metformin or AICAR treatment
induced p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 in p53+/+ cells (Fig. 4C).
Similar results were obtained in untransformed mouse embryo
fibroblasts (MEF). During autophagy, LC3 redistributes from the
cytoplasm to autophagic vesicles (27). The intracellular localization
of LC3 in p53+/+ and p53 / MEFs transduced with a GFP-LC3
construct was examined by fluorescence microscopy. Following
treatment with metformin or AICAR, LC3 redistributed from a
diffuse cytoplasmic staining to punctate structures only in p53+/+
cells, whereas in p53 / cells GFP-LC3 fluorescence remained
diffusely cytoplasmic (Fig. 5A and B). The accumulation of
punctate GFP-LC3 fluorescence in p53+/+ cells after metformin or
AICAR treatment was comparable with LC3 relocalization observed
after rapamycin treatment, a known inducer of autophagy (Fig. 5C).
Although GFP-LC3 fluorescence remained diffusely cytoplasmic in
p53 / cells after treatments with metformin or AICAR, punctate
GFP-LC3 relocalization was observed after rapamycin treatment
(Fig. 5B and C).
To investigate whether AMPK is necessary for metformininduced autophagy, MEF AMPK+/+ and AMPK / cells were transiently transfected with the GFP-LC3 construct and analyzed for
autophagic structures by fluorescence microscopy. Metformin
treatment induced relocalization of LC3 in AMPK+/+ cells, whereas
there was no significant change in the AMPK / cells (Fig. 5D).
Metformin and AICAR activate fatty acid B-oxidation in a
p53-dependent manner. The induction of fatty acid h-oxidation
has been reported as a marker of metabolic reprogramming in

www.aacrjournals.org

response to glucose deprivation (24). We therefore tested whether
either MEF p53+/+ or p53 / cells activate h-oxidation after
treatment with metformin or AICAR. AICAR markedly increased
the rate of fatty acid h-oxidation in p53+/+ cells, but not in p53 /
cells. Compared with AICAR, metformin modestly stimulated
h-oxidation, but the effects of metformin on h-oxidation were still
p53 dependent (Fig. 6A). Because treatment with metformin has
been reported to inhibit respiratory chain complex I in hepatocytes
(31, 32), the rate of oxygen consumption in intact cells after
treatment with metformin was measured. As shown in Fig. 6B,
metformin blocked mitochondrial respiratory activity by >70% in
all cell lines. Similar effects of AICAR or metformin on fatty acid
oxidation and oxygen consumption were also observed in HCT116
p53+/+ and p53 / cells (Supplementary Fig. S1 and S2A).
Metformin stimulates glycolysis in a p53-dependent manner.
If mitochondrial respiration is impaired, cells can compensate
through an enhanced rate of glycolysis to improve bioenergetics.
Glucose consumption and lactate production were measured in the
MEF p53+/+ and p53 / cell lines after treatment with metformin.
Metformin induced glucose consumption as well as lactate production in a dose-response manner in p53+/+ cells (Fig. 6C). No
significant stimulation of glucose consumption or lactate production was detected in cells lacking p53. We observed the same
p53 dependency on the effect of metformin on glucose consumption
and lactate production in HCT116 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B
and S2C). To address whether the effects of metformin on
glucose metabolism were dependent on AMPK, MEF AMPK+/+
and AMPK / cells were analyzed. As shown in Fig. 6D, the rate of
glucose consumption and lactate production were highly induced

any significant change, indicating that AMPK is required for
metformin-induced glycolysis.

Discussion
Recent population-based studies of type 2 diabetes patients have
reported that metformin treatment is associated with a reduced
cancer incidence and mortality (19, 20). Here, we investigated
whether metformin has a direct effect on growth of HCT116 colon
cancer cells in vivo. We report that treatment with either
metformin or AICAR, two known activators of AMPK, reduces
tumor growth in xenografts of HCT116 cells deficient for p53. In
contrast, metformin and AICAR have little to no effect on the
growth of xenografts of HCT116 p53+/+ cells. This selectivity
correlated with the ability of HCT116 and untransformed MEFs to
engage in a p53-dependent metabolic response that promoted cell
survival.
p53 is a tumor suppressor that is often mutated in cancer. In
response to genotoxic stresses, p53 induces a transcriptional
response that can result in cell cycle arrest, senescence, or
apoptosis. However, a recent study revealed a prosurvival role for
p53 in cells metabolically impaired by glucose limitation (12).
Activation of p53 allows cells to respond to glucose deprivation by

arresting their proliferation until glucose is restored. The ability of
glucose deprivation to induce p53 was found to be AMPK
dependent. AMPK activation promotes cell survival in response
to glucose deprivation by activating the catabolism of fatty acids
through h-oxidation and by enhancing the efficiency of the ability
to take up and capture remaining extracellular glucose. The data
presented here suggest that the ability of cells to engage in a
metabolic response to pharmacologic AMPK activators is p53
dependent. p53 is required to redirect the cell available nutrients
into catabolic pathways that can supply ATP production and cell
survival.
Metabolic adaptations are critical to maintain survival during
conditions of energetic stress. Autophagy is a survival pathway that
allows cells to degrade and metabolize part of the cytoplasm when
access to extracellular nutrients is limited (17). Autophagy has been
reported to be especially important for the survival of tumor cells
in the center of tumors (33). The data presented here support a role
for p53 in the induction of autophagy in response to metformin or
AICAR. The fact that p53-deficient cells induce autophagy by
rapamycin treatment suggest that p53 is not necessary for
autophagy in general. However, p53 seems to be required for
autophagy induced after treatment with metformin or AICAR.
Fang et al. (34) have reported that p53 activates autophagy in
response to etoposide treatment through inhibition of mammalian

target of rapamycin activity and showed that AMPK is involved
in this pathway. The present work shows that p53 is also required
for the induction of autophagy by pharmacologic activators of
AMPK and we genetically determined that the mechanism of this
metformin-mediated p53-dependent autophagy is dependent on
AMPK.
AMPK signaling pathway is an evolutionary conserved mechanism that allows eukaryotic cells to coordinate the way that
nutrients are used to generate ATP during conditions of
bioenergetic impairment. In a previous work, the AMPK-dependent
activation of fatty acid oxidation was shown to enhance the ability
of glioblastoma cancer cells to survive under conditions of glucose
deprivation (24). Here, we show that the cellular AMPK activators
metformin and AICAR stimulate fatty acid oxidation in both
HCT116 and MEF cells and that p53 is required for this effect.
Under conditions of glucose limitation, p53-deficient cells showed
an impaired ability to survive when treated with metformin
compared with p53+/+ cells. However, pharmacologic inhibition of
fatty acid oxidation only slightly abrogated the p53-dependent cell
survival of these cells, suggesting that catabolism of other nutrients
such as amino acids may contribute to ATP production upon
glucose deprivation. A recent work highlights the prosurvival role
of autophagy in cancer cells (35). Amaravadi et al. showed that
inhibition of autophagy enhances p53-induced apoptosis, providing
evidence that autophagy can be an adaptive mechanism of survival
in tumor recurrence after p53 activation of Myc/p53ERTAM
lymphomas. AMPK-dependent induction of autophagy may provide
an alternative strategy for p53-dependent tumor survival under
conditions of metabolic stress.

Tumor Growth

The mechanisms by which metformin activates AMPK is indirect
and poorly understood. Metformin has been previously described
as a complex I inhibitor in hepatocytes. Therefore, metformin
could activate AMPK by compromising oxidative phosphorylation.
Consistent with this, treatment with metformin strongly blocked
oxygen consumption in MEFs. Complex I inhibition also resulted
in suppression of h-oxidation of fatty acids due to the inhibition
of NADH oxidation. One rate-limiting step in mitochondrial
h-oxidation is catalyzed by L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase,
which requires NAD+ as a cofactor. NADH generated by this step is
then reoxidized by complex I of the respiratory chain. Severe
impairment of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation increases
mitochondrial NADH/NAD+ ratio, which may explain the limited
activation of h-oxidation observed in metformin-treated cells. To
compensate for the metformin-dependent inhibition of oxidative
phosphorylation, we found that p53+/+ cells but not p53 / cells
enhance their rate of glycolysis. In addition, we showed that AMPK
is required for this metabolic switch because the effects of
metformin on glycolysis were completely abrogated in AMPK /
fibroblasts. These data suggest that p53 is a regulator of multiple
adaptive metabolic responses that compensate for bioenergetic
compromise and not simply an activation of mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation as previously suggested (14).
Metabolic alterations are hallmarks in the pathogenesis of cancer.
Cancer cells are often under a variety of stress stimuli, such as
hypoxia and lack of nutrients. To successfully overcome these stress
stimuli and meet their high metabolic demand, it is crucial that
cancer cells engage proper adaptive responses to provide sufficient
ATP supply and support survival. Although loss of p53 confers a

Figure 6. Metformin or AICAR treatment activates a p53-dependent metabolic response. A, fatty acid oxidation was determined by measuring 3H2O produced by
MEF cells after incubation with [9,10-3H]palmitate. MEF p53+/+ and p53 / cells were incubated in medium containing 2 mmol/L metformin, 1 mmol/L AICAR, or without
any drug (Control ). B, mitochondrial respiratory activity of MEF p53+/+ and p53 / cells was measured by an oxygen consumption assay. Cells were incubated in
medium in the presence or absence of 2 mmol/L metformin for 20 h. Cells (4  106) were resuspended in 200 AL conditioned medium with or without 2 mmol/L
metformin and analyzed. C, glucose consumption and lactate production were measured after incubation of MEF p53+/+ and p53 / cells or (D ) MEF AMPKa+/+ and
AMPKa / cells with or without indicated amounts of metformin for 48 h. Columns, mean of triplicate samples; bars, SD. Representative of three independent

selective growth advantage to cancer cells, loss of p53 impairs the
ability of cancer cells to respond to metabolic changes induced by
metformin or AICAR and to survive under conditions of nutrient
deprivation. In fact, we observed increased apoptosis in vivo and an
impaired ability to survive under conditions of glucose limitation
in vitro when p53-deficient tumor cells were treated with metformin.
These findings suggest a potential benefit of metformin use
in patients harboring p53-deficient tumors, which are often resistant
to existing forms of chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
