Blockade to Reject Preimplanted Tumors

Abstract
The transformation of a healthy cell into a malignant neoplasm
involves numerous genetic mutations and aberrations in gene
expression. As few of these changes are shared between
individuals or types of cancer, the best source for eliciting
broad-spectrum tumor immunity remains each patient’s own
tumor. Previously, we have shown that combining blockade of
the T-cell–negative costimulatory molecule CTL-associated
antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and vaccination with irradiated B16 tumor
expressing granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF; Gvax) promotes rejection of established murine
melanomas. Here we show that, like GM-CSF, the cytokine Flt3
ligand (Flt3L) expressed in B16 and coupled with CTLA-4
blockade promotes both prophylactic and therapeutic rejection of B16. When administered at the site of growing tumor,
Gvax fails to prevent tumor outgrowth in any mice, whereas the
B16-Flt3L vaccine (Fl3vax) induces the rejection of 75% of
melanomas implanted 3 days before vaccination. Relative to
Gvax, Fl3vax promotes greater infiltration of both the vaccine
site and the tumor site by CD8+ T cells and ‘‘sentinel’’ and
plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Gvax and Fl3vax did not synergize
when used in combination in treating B16 melanoma even in
the context of CD25+ regulatory T-cell depletion. Further, we
show that a combination of Flt3L expression and CTLA-4
blockade can also promote the rejection of established TRAMP
prostate adenocarcinomas, proving that the utility of this
treatment extends beyond melanoma. Engineering Flt3L to be
constitutively secreted and attaching an IgG2a tail yielded a
B16 vaccine that, when combined with CTLA-4 blockade,
prevented the outgrowth of significantly more 5-day implanted
B16-BL6 tumors than did Gvax. [Cancer Res 2009;69(19):7747–55]

Introduction
Irradiated tumor cells can be reintroduced as a vaccine;
however, the induced antitumor responses are ineffective due to
lack of immune costimulation (1). Granulocyte macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has proved the most capable
adjuvant for transforming irradiated tumor vaccines into mediators
of tumor protection and sometimes rejection (2). Cellular tumor
vaccines rely on cross-presentation of tumor antigens by professional antigen-presenting cells (APC; ref. 3). GM-CSF enhances this
process both by inducing differentiation and maturation of APCs

such as dendritic cells (DC) and by chemoattracting granulocytes,
macrophages, and lymphocytes to the vaccine site (4).
We sought to determine whether other molecules that may
enhance cross-presentation could substitute for GM-CSF in
converting irradiated tumor into an effective vaccine. The cytokine
Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) supports the survival,
proliferation, and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors (5)
and both induces and chemoattracts DCs (6, 7). Recombinant Flt3L
promotes tumor regression in some tumor models (8), but alone
cannot reject preimplanted poorly immunogenic tumors like B16
melanoma. The chemokine IP10/CXCL10 is known both to chemoattract monocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and TH1 lymphocytes (9)
and to have antiangiogenic properties (10). IP10 can function in
immunotherapy and has been associated with graft rejection and
GvHD in transplantation (11–13). The chemokine MCP-3/CCL7
potently attracts lymphoid and myeloid cells (14–17). MCP-3
can also promote antitumor responses and has been implicated in
graft rejection and GvHD (18–20). The adjuvant activity of GM-CSF
for tumor vaccination has been best characterized in the B16
melanoma model; thus, we compared these candidate adjuvants in
this setting.
Vaccination with irradiated B16 expressing GM-CSF can protect
mice against subsequent tumor challenge and can slow the growth
of, but not reject, preimplanted tumors (2). To reject established
melanomas, B16-GMCSF (Gvax) vaccination must be combined with
antibody blockade of the T-cell–negative costimulatory receptor
CTL-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4; ref. 21). Blockade of CTLA-4/B7
binding using antibodies exerts a powerful adjuvant effect on T cells
and can induce the rejection of many transplantable tumors. In the
case of less immunogenic tumors such as B16 melanoma or TRAMP
prostate adenocarcinomas, CTLA-4 blockade alone may slow the
growth of, but cannot reject, preimplanted tumors (22–24). The
combination of CTLA-4 blockade and Gvax vaccination, however,
synergizes to induce rejection of established tumors in these models
(21, 25, 26) and in some clinical trials (27, 28).
Using retroviral vectors, we created B16 cell lines expressing
GM-CSF (Gvax), Flt3L (FL3vax), IP10, or MCP-3. We measured the
efficacy of these vaccines in prophylaxis and treatment in combination with CTLA-4 blockade. We next compared the relative efficacy of each vaccine when administered at the tumor site versus on
the opposite flank. These experiments revealed distinct treatment
profiles for GM-CSF–, Flt3L-, and IP10–expressing vaccines and
strongly validated Flt3L as a cellular tumor adjuvant. We found that
Fl3vax and Gvax did not synergize when used for combination
treatment of B16 melanomas or TRAMP adenocarcinomas. We
thoroughly characterized the lymphocytic infiltrates of both the
vaccine sites and tumors of mice receiving Gvax, Fl3vax, or the combination in the context of CTLA-4 blockade. In addition, we sought
to determine the utility of Flt3L as a cellular tumor adjuvant outside
of the B16 system by comparing it to GM-CSF for the treatment
of established TRAMP tumors. Finally, we reengineered our FL3vax

to optimize the bioactivity of Flt3L and compared the enhanced
vaccine to Gvax in treating 5-day established B16 melanomas.

Materials and Methods
Mice. C57BL/6 mice (4–6 wk old males, The Jackson Laboratory) were
cared for in accordance with the NIH and Association for Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care regulations. Experiments were all
approved by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee.
Antibodies. Mouse a-CTLA-4 (9D9), hamster a-CTLA-4 (9H10), a-CD25
(PC61), a-CD4 (GK1.5), a-CD8 (2.43), and a-NK1.1 (PK136) were purified at
the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center antibody facility. Antibodies
and gating for 9-color flow cytometry are outlined in Supplementary
Table S2.
Cell lines. B16/BL6 cells were used for tumor challenge and for the
creation of all vaccine lines and were maintained as described (21). TRAMPC2 cells were used in all prostate cancer experiments and for creation of
TRAMP-GMCSF and TRAMP-Flt3L and grown as described (29).
Retroviral vectors and virus production. Murine GM-CSF, Flt3L, IP10,
and MCP-3 cDNAs were cloned into the pMG-Lyt2 retroviral vector. This
vector resembles pGC-IRES except that a truncated form of murine CD8a is
used for selection (30). Recombinant virus production and infection were
done as described, except that vesicular stomatitis virus-G and 10A1
envelope proteins were used (31).

Tumor Challenge and Treatment Experiments
B16 tumor treatment. Mice were injected in the flank intradermally
(i.d.) at day 0 with the indicated number of B16-BL6 cells and treated
on days 3, 6, and 9 (5, 8, and 11 for Figs. 3 and 6) with 1  106 irradiated
(150 Gy) gene-modified B16 cells on the contralateral flank and 100-Ag
a-CTLA-4 (9D9) i.p. All vaccinations were on the opposite flank from
tumor except in Fig. 3, with ‘‘local’’ groups receiving their vaccinations
on the same flank as the tumor challenge. For FL3vax/Gvax combination vaccines, all were normalized to a total dose of 2  106 B16 cells
per vaccine by addition of B16-Lyt2 cells. Where indicated, regulatory
T-cell (Treg) depletion was achieved by a single 400-Ag injection of
a-CD25 on day 4.

TRAMP-C2 Tumor Treatment

Mice were injected in the flank i.d. at day 0 with 1  106 TRAMP-C2
prostatic adenocarcinoma cells and treated on days 2, 5, and 8 with 1  106
irradiated (120 Gy) gene-modified TRAMP-C2 cells on the contralateral
flank and 100-Ag a-CTLA-4 (9H10) i.p.

Vaccine Site Infiltration Analysis
Mice received two gene-modified B16 vaccines i.d., 4 d apart, in 30%
collagen matrix (Matrigel, BD) coupled with 100 Ag of a-CTLA-4 i.p. Gvax,
Fl3vax, and Gvax/Fl3vax vaccines were formulated as described above. One
day after the second vaccination, mice were euthanized, the vaccine site
was excised, and infiltrating lymphocytes were obtained after disruption

and Ficoll purification. Infiltrating cells were stained with fluorophoreconjugated monoclonal antibodies and analyzed by nine-color flow
cytometry on a Cyan flow cytometer (Dako; Supplementary Table S2).

Tumor Infiltration Analysis
Mice were injected in the flank i.d. at day 0 with 10,000 B16/BL6 cells in
30% collagen matrix (Matrigel, BD). Mice were vaccinated as described for
day 3 tumor treatment. Thirteen to 15 d after tumor challenge, mice were
sacrificed, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were obtained from
tumors and purified and stained as described earlier for intra-vaccine
lymphocytes.

Results
We compared the adjuvant efficacy of two chemokines, MCP-3
and IP10, and the cytokine Flt3L to the established adjuvant
cytokine GM-CSF (Supplementary Table S1). Retroviral vectors
were constructed with a marker gene directly linked to the
adjuvant gene, ensuring that the levels of the two genes were
proportional (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Cell lines were normalized
by cell sorting to equivalent high levels of marker gene expression
(Supplementary Fig. S1B and C) and then expression of the
adjuvant gene was confirmed by intracellular cytokine staining
(Supplementary Fig. S1D). This system allowed rapid generation
of vaccine cell lines expressing levels of all adjuvant genes within
or exceeding the known ED50 ranges by ELISA (Supplementary
Table S1).
Flt3L and IP10 are effective adjuvants for B16 prophylactic
vaccination. Mice were vaccinated twice with irradiated tumor
cells before being challenged with B16-BL6 melanoma cells on the
opposite flank. Compared with B16-YFP, B16-GMCSF (Gvax), B16Flt3L (FL3vax), and B16-IP10 all showed statistically significant
activity in preventing tumor growth (Fig. 1A). Although MCP-3
protected more mice than B16-YFP alone, its effect was not
significant.
The YFP marker created high variability in the B16-YFP control
(Fig. 1A) and was difficult to normalize in expression between lines
(Supplementary Fig. S1B); thus, for all subsequent experiments, a
nonimmunogenic truncated Lyt2 marker was used instead. These
Lyt2 vectors yielded similar prophylactic data to the YFP vectors
(Supplementary Fig. S2) but were easier to normalize (Supplementary Fig. S1C) and lacked the potentially confounding immunogenicity of YFP. Compared with B16 alone, B16-Lyt2 grew at the same
rate in untreated mice (data not shown).
B16-Flt3L is as effective as B16-GMCSF in treating 3-day
implanted B16 melanomas when combined with antibody
blockade of CTLA-4. To compare our adjuvant genes to GM-CSF,
we tested their ability to synergize with CTLA-4 antibody blockade
to treat 1  104 B16 melanoma cells implanted 3 days earlier.
Individually, neither any of the cellular vaccines nor CTLA-4
blockade alone slows tumor growth (Fig. 1B) or is curative. When
coupled with CTLA-4 blockade, treatment with Gvax or Fl3vax
resulted in 63% and 60% tumor-free mice (Fig. 1C). By comparison,
IP10 and MCP-3 showed much less capacity to prolong the survival
of B16-bearing mice. Gvax and Fl3vax were also most effective in
slowing tumor growth (Fig. 1D), whereas B16-MCP3 had no effect
on tumor growth and was not studied further.
FL3vax and B16-IP10 increase in effectiveness when
administered at the tumor site, whereas Gvax fails to prevent
tumor outgrowth in any mice. As melanoma lesions can
sometimes be directly accessed for treatment, we tested the
efficacy of Gvax, Fl3vax, and B16-IP10 both locally (at the tumor

mice when given at the tumor site where Gvax proves ineffective, whereas
B16-IP10 is effective locally but not distally. A, percent tumor-free mice following
vaccination on days 3, 6, and 9 (n = 2, 10 mice per group, except PBS
vaccination was only distal to 5 mice per group). B, mean tumor size at the

site) and distally (on the opposite flank) in combination with
CTLA-4 blockade.
Surprisingly, Gvax showed vastly diminished efficacy in treating
mice that had been challenged with 2  104 B16 cells 3 days prior,
when administered locally versus distally in terms of both tumorfree survival (Fig. 2A) and tumor size at first measurement (Fig. 2B).
No tumor growth curve is provided because granulomas evoked
by the vaccine at the tumor site cannot be distinguished from tumor
for 3 to 4 weeks. Unlike Gvax, Fl3vax was significantly more
effective when administered at the tumor site versus the opposite
flank, resulting in 75% tumor-free mice. B16-IP10, which showed
little effect distally, proved to be effective when given at the
tumor site.
Gvax can induce myeloid suppressor cells under certain
conditions, suggesting that the failure of Gvax proximal to tumor
may be due to the interaction of the myeloid cells evoked by the
vaccine and the tumor microenvironment (32, 33). Our Gvax line
produces 360 ng/1  106 cells/24 hours of GM-CSF, which is within
the optimal immunogenicity range and well below the levels that
have been described as inherently suppressive (32, 34). These data
indicated that there were likely to be significant differences in the

cellular subsets evoked by each vaccine; therefore, we sought to
determine if Gvax and Fl3vax would cooperate in eradicating B16
melanomas.
Combination treatment with Fl3vax and Gvax is no more
effective than using either vaccine alone. To test the potential
for Fl3vax and Gvax to synergize in rejecting B16 melanomas, we
waited until 5 days following tumor challenge to begin treatment.
Gvax and FL3vax showed similar efficacy; however, combination
treatment with both vaccines prevented tumor outgrowth in equal
or fewer mice compared with either alone (Fig. 3A). In addition,
tumors in mice receiving the dual cytokine vaccine grew at similar
or faster rates compared with tumors in mice receiving either
vaccine alone (Fig. 3B).
Both B16-Flt3L and B16-GMCSF vaccinations are known to elicit
Tregs that dampen antitumor responses (35, 36). To determine if
these two cytokines would synergize in the absence of Tregs, we
repeated the above experiments in mice that had been predepleted of CD25+ cells. Once again, the combination of Gvax and
Fl3vax was clearly no more effective than either vaccine alone
(Fig. 3C), although the potency of all vaccines was enhanced by
Treg pre-depletion. Tumors in mice vaccinated with both B16-Flt3L
and B16-GMCSF, although small, grew at similar or faster rates
compared with tumors in mice receiving either vaccine alone
(Fig. 3D). To further understand the mechanisms of action of each
these vaccines, we examined the cells infiltrating both the vaccine
and tumor sites for each.

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (19). October 1, 2009

Fl3vax treatment relies on CD8+ T cells, NK1.1+ cells, and
CD4+ cells and is opposed by the action of CD4+CD25+ Tregs.
Published analysis for Gvax indicated that CD8+ T cells and NK1.1+
cells were the critical populations for rejecting B16 tumors (26). We
found that in mice depleted of CD8+ cells or NK1.1+ cells, Fl3vax +
a-CTLA-4 vaccination lost virtually all capacity to promote rejection of tumors implanted 3 days earlier (Supplementary Fig. S3A),
and tumors grew at rates similar to those in untreated mice
(Supplementary Fig. S3B). In addition, a much higher percentage of
CD4-depleted mice developed tumors, and those tumors grew
faster than the tumors in mice pre-depleted of Tregs (which are
also depleted by a-CD4). Thus, we found that CD8+ T cells, CD4+
T cells, and NK1.1+ cells all play important roles in rejecting tumors
following Fl3vax vaccination with CTLA-4 blockade. We hoped that
a more detailed study of the vaccine and TIL populations evoked by
each vaccine would further clarify the adjuvant mechanics of each,
and perhaps suggest reasons for their lack of synergy.
Relative to Gvax, Fl3vax vaccination sites contain a higher
percentage of CD8+ T cells, NK cells, plasmacytoid DCs, and
CD11b /lo DCs. Mice were given two vaccinations with Gvax,
FL3vax, or a combination of both with a-CTLA-4 antibody, and
24 hours later, the lymphocytes infiltrating the vaccine site were
isolated and typed (Supplementary Table S2). For both Gvax and
Fl3vax, the vaccination site infiltrate was dominated by granulocytes and macrophages (Fig. 4A). Despite this similarity, the B16Flt3L site contained a 2- to 3-fold higher fraction of B cells, NK

cells, and CD11b /lo DCs relative to the B16-GMCSF site. Most
strikingly, plasmacytoid DCs (pDC) and CD8+ T cells comprised 5.5fold and 8.5-fold higher fractions of the Fl3vax site compared with
that of Gvax. Tregs, granulocytes, and monocytes/CD11bmed/hi DCs

were more abundant in the B16-GMCSF site. The CD11b /lo DC
population favored by Flt3L consists primarily of ‘‘sentinel’’ DCs
and pDCs, whereas the CD11c+CD11bmed/hi population elicited by
GM-CSF is a mixture of monocytes and ‘‘inflammatory’’ DCs (37).

The most striking difference between the Gvax/Fl3vax combination
and either vaccine alone was the relative lack of NK cells and
T cells, especially CD8+ T cells.
We next decided to investigate how the differences observed in
the composition of the vaccine sites would affect the profile of the
lymphocytes infiltrating the tumor.
Fl3vax induces higher percentages of CD8+ T cells, Tregs,
sentinel DCs, and pDCs and fewer CD11b+GR1+ cells in tumors
relative to those of mice receiving Gvax. To dissect the
differential effects of Gvax, Fl3vax, and combination vaccination
in treating B16, we undertook a more comprehensive analysis of
the TIL population. Following tumor implantation and three
vaccinations, TIL were isolated and characterized (Fig. 4B). We
found that overall TIL frequency (i.e., the extent of infiltration) in
mice receiving the Gvax, Fl3vax, and Gvax/Fl3vax vaccines with
CTLA-4 blockade was similar and substantially higher than in
untreated mice (Supplementary Fig. S4). Similar to the vaccine site
infiltrate, TIL from Fl3vax-treated mice contained higher proportions of sentinel DCs, pDCs, NKDCs, and CD8+ T cells and
lower levels of inflammatory DCs relative to TIL from mice receiving
Gvax. Unlike the vaccine site, FL3vax-inoculated mice also had
higher levels of Tregs in their tumors. Despite having large
numbers of granulocytes, macrophages, and DCs, TIL from the
combination vaccinated mice contained the lowest percentage of
CD8+ T cells.
Tregs suppress cytotoxic T cells, and in the case of B16, elevated
ratios of CD8+ T cells to FoxP3+ Tregs within the tumor correlate
with successful treatment (35). Both Gvax and Fl3vax increase the
ratio of CD8+ T cells to Tregs within the tumor, especially in
conjunction with a-CTLA-4 antibody (Fig. 4C). Of the mice
receiving CTLA-4 blockade, this ratio is lowest in the combination-vaccine group but not to an extent, which explains its reduced
immunogenicity. Although Tregs do make up a larger percentage of
the TIL elicited by Fl3vax relative to Gvax, the even higher level of
CD8+ T cells also elicited by Fl3vax yielded the highest CD8/Treg
ratios in TIL.
As CD11b+,GR1+ candidate myeloid suppressor cells can be
classified as either macrophages or granulocytes in our typing
system depending on the other markers they express, we decided
to analyze their relative enrichment in the tumors of vaccinated
mice as a separate population. We find that vaccination with Gvax,
with or without CTLA-4 blockade, results in significantly higher
percentages of CD11b+,GR1+ cells in TIL compared with mice
receiving FL3vax or compared with untreated mice (Fig. 4D). This
enhanced infiltration by myeloid suppressor cells may explain the
failure of Gvax to cure tumors when given at the tumor site where
much higher concentrations of GM-CSF would be present around
the tumor.
Having shown the efficacy of Fl3vax for treating preimplanted
B16 melanomas in conjunction with CTLA-4 blockade, we sought
to determine whether it would also have utility for the treatment of
other poorly immunogenic tumors.
Flt3L expression synergizes with CTLA-4 blockade in
rendering irradiated autologous TRAMP-C2 cells capable of
preventing the outgrowth of 2-day implanted TRAMP-C2
prostate adenocarcinomas. We used retroviral vectors to create
GM-CSF– and Flt3L-expressing vaccines derived from the TRAMPC2 prostate adenocarcinoma. The majority of TRAMP-C2 tumors
cannot be cured by either Gvax or CTLA-4 blockade alone, but are
susceptible to combination therapy. We found that both TRAMPGMCSF and TRAMP-Flt3L could protect 100% of mice from

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (19). October 1, 2009

outgrowth of 1-day preimplanted low-dose (5  105 cells) TRAMPC2 tumors when combined with CTLA-4 blockade (data not
shown). For this reason, we sought to block the outgrowth of a
higher TRAMP-C2 challenge (1  106 cells) with vaccination on
days 2, 5, and 8.
Treatment with TRAMP-GMCSF, TRAMP-Flt3L, and a combination of both resulted in similar percentages of tumor-free mice
when combined with CTLA-4 blockade (Fig. 5A). The overall tumor
growth rate was also not significantly different between mice
receiving either vaccine (Fig. 5B). As with B16, combination therapy
with TRAMP-GMCSF and TRAMP-Flt3L failed to show any efficacy
beyond that of either treatment alone. These data show that the
adjuvant utility of Flt3L extends beyond the B16 melanoma system.
An improved FL3vax synergizes with CTLA-4 blockade and
protects more mice from outgrowth of B16 melanoma
implanted 5 days before treatment than does Gvax. Whereas
GM-CSF has been shown to plateau in adjuvant efficacy at a
relatively modest level (34), we wondered if the efficacy of Flt3L
might increase with higher levels of expression. A preliminary study
suggested that Gvax decreased in efficacy with increasing dose,
whereas FL3vax maintained or slightly increased its effect at higher
doses (Supplementary Fig. S5). This system suffered from many
limitations, however, including veterinary complications due to the
large vaccine dose (5  106 per injection), as well as the potential to

saturate the amount of serum protease available to release Flt3L
from the cell membrane in its bioactive form. We decided instead
to create two new vaccines that constitutively secrete Flt3L. One of
these is truncated at the site where membrane cleavage occurs in
the wild-type form (secFL3vax), and the other is truncated at the
same site and joined to a mouse IgG2a constant region for
increased stability and to enable dimerization (sFL3vaxIg). Each of
these lines was normalized to the same Lyt2 expression level as
FL3vax and found to produce between 900 and 1,000 ng/1  106 cells/
24 hours of Flt3L in vitro.
To compare these new vaccines to the original FL3vax and
Gvax, we tested their ability to synergize with CTLA-4 blockade to
block outgrowth of B16 melanoma cells injected 5 days before
treatment. In this setting, sFL3vaxIg cured a significantly higher
percentage of mice than did Gvax or any of the other Flt3L-based
vaccines (Fig. 6A). The tumors of mice receiving the sFL3vaxIg
vaccine with CTLA-4 blockade also grew at a significantly slower
rate than those of any other treatment group in each of three
individual experiments (Fig. 6B). These experiments showed
that this enhanced Flt3L-expressing B16 vaccine was superior to
Gvax for use in treating B16 melanoma in conjunction with
CTLA-4 blockade.

Discussion
We pursued a rational approach to determine if molecules
designed to enhance infiltration of a vaccine site by APCs could
substitute for GM-CSF in rendering autologous tumor immunogenic. In our hands, Flt3L and IP10 function effectively as adjuvants
for B16 melanoma vaccination, as they protected mice from
subsequent tumor challenge when used prophylactically (Fig. 1A),
and were capable of effectively treating preimplanted B16 tumors
when combined with CTLA-4 blockade (Fig. 1C). Most impressively,
Fl3vax, like Gvax, proved capable of synergizing with a-CTLA-4
treatment to completely prevent the outgrowth of a majority of
3-day established B16 melanomas (Fig. 1C and D).
As we investigated the application and mechanics of FL3vax
further, we found that in some settings, its efficacy exceeded
that of Gvax. One of the most striking findings we report is the
inability of Gvax + a-CTLA-4 therapy to prevent tumor growth
in any mice bearing 3-day preimplanted B16 melanomas when
given at the tumor site versus on the opposite flank (Fig. 2).
In contrast, Fl3vax showed similar efficacy to Gvax when given on
the opposite flank, but resulted in 75% of mice being tumor-free
when given locally. As further evidence for the lack of local
immunogenicity of Gvax, we and others have found little or no
reduced growth of B16-GMCSF cells in vivo relative to untransduced B16 cells (38). Most interestingly, the Fl3vax-elicited
infiltrate seems to be resistant to co-optation by the tumor
microenvironment and likely benefits from reduced trafficking
requirements and sustained antigen availability. Relevantly, we
later found that even distal Gvax inoculation increases the
percentage of CD11b+GR1+ candidate myeloid suppressor cells in
B16 tumors relative to FL3vax-treated or untreated mice (Fig. 4D).
For malignancies such as melanoma in which tumor sites are
accessible to direct injection, these data provide a compelling
rationale for clinical evaluation of Fl3vax in conjunction with
CTLA-4 blockade.
The differences in local versus distal efficacy between Fl3vax and
Gvax suggested that there were distinct mechanisms underlying

blockade and more effectively treats mice of 5-d preimplanted B16 melanomas
than does Gvax. A, percent tumor-free mice following vaccination on days 5, 8,

their immunogenicity, and we hoped that they might synergize
when used in combination. In both the B16 and TRAMP tumor
models, however, Gvax and FL3vax failed to cooperate when used
in combination even in the context of Treg depletion (Figs. 3 and
5). To better understand this observation as well as the underlying
differences between Fl3vax and Gvax, we isolated and characterized the lymphocytes infiltrating both the vaccine site and tumor in
response to each vaccine.
Compared with vaccines expressing GM-CSF, we find a higher
percentage of CD11b /lo DCs and much higher proportion of pDCs
and CD8+ T cells infiltrating the Flt3L site (Fig. 4A). CD4+FoxP3+
Tregs are known to suppress the activity both of CD8+ T cells and
DCs (39, 40), and we have reported that higher CD8/Treg ratios
within tumors are indicative of effective vaccination (35). Within
the Fl3vax vaccination site there are few Tregs, suggesting a
favorable environment for immune priming. Compared with either
vaccine alone, the combination-vaccine site contains very low
levels of T and NK cells, suggesting a possible qualitative defect in
the APCs generated by FL3vax + Gvax.
The TIL evoked by FL3vax + a-CTLA-4 contain the highest levels
of CD8+ T cells, pDCs, and CD11b /lo DCs we observed (Fig. 4B and
C) and the lowest levels of CD11b+GR1+ cells (Fig. 4D). The tumors
of FL3vax recipient mice are substantially infiltrated by Tregs;
however, the increase in CD8+ T cells exceeds that of Tregs and

preserves a highly advantageous CD8+ T-cell/Treg ratio. The
synergy we observed between Treg depletion and Fl3vax combination therapy may be due to the removal of suppression from these
large numbers of CD8+ T cells and DCs (Supplementary Fig. S3).
A prior publication reported that B16-GMCSF was more effective
preventively compared with B16-Flt3L, and that GM-CSF elicited,
based on higher B7-1 expression, a qualitatively and quantitatively
superior DC infiltration of the vaccine (38). We found that the levels
of Flt3L produced by their vaccine are substantially lower than ours
by both ELISA (290 versus 950 ng/1  106 cells/24 hours) and flow
cytometry (Supplementary Fig. S6), which we believe may explain
the disparity between our results. Also the differences in our B16
systems (BL6 versus F10) or in the timing of our prophylactic
vaccinations could be relevant. Besides our own observations, a
wealth of data now exists, which suggests not only that Flt3L
potently generates highly stimulatory DCs (7, 8, 41) but also that
those DCs, despite lower expression of B7-1, may be superior for
T-cell priming compared with those generated by GM-CSF (42, 43).
We observed that the efficacy of Flt3L seemed to increase with
higher doses (Supplementary Fig. S5), whereas it is known that the
adjuvant activity of GM-CSF decreases at higher expression levels

(32). To increase the bioactivity of our Flt3L transgene, we fused the
extracellular domain to a mouse immunoglobulin constant region,
creating an enhanced vaccine termed sFL3vaxIg. Compared with
Gvax, sFL3vaxIg was able to prevent outgrowth of more 5-day
preimplanted B16-BL6 tumors in conjunction with CTLA-4
blockade (Fig. 6). Taken together, these observations suggest that
Fl3vax may be a broadly useful vaccine for the treatment of human
malignancies especially in conjunction with CTLA-4 blockade.
