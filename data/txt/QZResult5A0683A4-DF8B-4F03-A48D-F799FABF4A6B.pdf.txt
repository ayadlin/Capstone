Abstract
The selective ubiquitination of proteins by ubiquitin E3 ligases
plays an important regulatory role in control of cell
differentiation, growth, and transformation and their dysregulation is often associated with pathologic outcomes,
including tumorigenesis. RNF5 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that
has been implicated in motility and endoplasmic reticulum
stress response. Here, we show that RNF5 expression is upregulated in breast cancer tumors and related cell lines.
Elevated expression of RNF5 was seen in breast cancer cell
lines that became more sensitive to cytochalasin D– and
paclitaxel-induced apoptosis following its knockdown with
specific short interfering RNA. Inhibition of RNF5 expression
markedly decreased cell proliferation and caused a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in response to stress in MCF-7
but not in p53 mutant breast cancer cells, suggesting a p53dependent function. Significantly, high levels of RNF5 were
associated with decreased survival in human breast cancer
specimens. Similarly, RNF5 levels were higher in metastatic
melanoma specimens and in melanoma, leukemia, ovarian,
and renal tumor-derived cell lines, suggesting that increased
RNF5 expression may be a common event during tumor
progression. These results indicate that RNF5 is a novel
regulator of breast cancer progression through its effect on
actin cytoskeletal alterations, which also affect sensitivity of
breast cancer cells to cytoskeletal targeting antineoplastic
agents. [Cancer Res 2007;67(17):8172–9]

Introduction
Ubiquitin E3 ligases regulate a vast number of cellular
processes, including development, proliferation, cell cycle control,
transcription, apoptosis, and DNA repair (1–3). It is evident that
many really interesting new gene (RING) finger proteins, which
have been implicated in cell growth and development, possess E3
ligase activity and mediate the ubiquitination of their substrates
(4). A growing number of RING E3 ligases are aberrantly expressed
or regulated during tumorigenesis (4, 5). Depending on the
specific substrate, an E3 ligase can either promote or inhibit

cancer development. For example, the MDM2 oncogene, which
targets p53 for ubiquitination-dependent degradation, is overexpressed in human tumors (6). In contrast, the tumor suppressors
BRCA1 and BRCA2 and von Hippel-Lindau are frequently mutated
or deleted in human tumors (7, 8). RNF5 is an 18-kDa RING
finger E3 ligase that is important for development in Caenorhabditis elegans by regulating proper formation of muscle
attachment sites (9). In mammalian cells, RNF5 regulates cell
motility by ubiquitinating the focal adhesion protein paxillin (10),
which triggers the exclusion of paxillin from the focal adhesions.
RNF5 (a.k.a. RMA1) was also shown to serve as a quality control
protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, through which it contributes to the clearance of malfolded proteins, including mutant
CFTR (D108; ref. 11). RNF5/RMA1 was also shown to affect the
Salmonella protein SOP-A by ubiquitination that facilitates its
trafficking from the endosomes/vacuoles to the cytosol (12),
further substantiating the role of this ligase in control of protein
localization in the cell. In this study, we show that RNF5
modulates breast cancer cell sensitivity to cytoskeletal-targeting
anticancer agents and that RNF5 expression inversely correlates
with survival of breast cancer patients. Our findings suggest that
through the dynamic rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and
increased cell proliferation, RNF5 plays an important role in
neoplastic progression of breast cancer and possibly other human
tumors.

Materials and Methods
Tumor tissue mRNA array. The BioChain Human Adult Tumor/Normal
Tissues mRNA Array (BioChain Institute, Inc.) was used to analyze RNF5
expression. This array contains equal amounts of mRNA from 47 tumor
tissues and their corresponding normal tissues. Biotinylated DNA probes
recognizing either RNF5 or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) transcripts were generated by random labeling using the NEBlot
Phototope kit (New England Biolabs). Hybridization was carried out
overnight using FastHyb-Hybridization Solution (BioChain Institute)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Levels of RNF5 or GAPDH
mRNA were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) using the
Phototope-Star detection kit (New England Biolabs) and analyzed on a
Bio-Rad GS800 scanning densitometer. The RNF5 expression level for each
tumor and corresponding normal tissue was normalized to GAPDH and
then compared.
Cell lines and cell culture. Breast carcinoma MCF-7, SKBR3, BT-24,
BT-474, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, and ZR-75-1 cells were cultured in
growth medium [DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and supplemented with 100 units penicillin/mL and 100 units streptomycin/mL].
Human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) were cultured in MEGM
mammary epithelial cell medium supplemented with singlequots (Clonetics).
RNA isolation and reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Total RNA was
purified with the Qiagen RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. cDNA synthesis was done with the Moloney murine leukemia

virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using 2 Ag RNA and a polydeoxythymidine oligonucleotide as a template. Semiquantitative PCR was
carried out for 20 cycles using [a-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) and
10 ng cDNA. Reaction products were resolved by 5% PAGE and visualized
and quantified on a Bio-Rad FX Molecular Imager.
Western blot. Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay
(RIPA) buffer (PBS, 1% NP40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmol/L EDTA)
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Western blotting
was done using standard procedures with antibodies directed against RNF5
and visualized by ECL. Antibodies directed against h-actin and a-tubulin
were used as loading controls.
National Cancer Institute 60-tumor cell line panel microarray.
Established tumor cell lines were cultured as described previously (13),
harvested after fixation, and embedded in paraffin to be spotted onto a
tissue microarray block for immunohistochemical screening. The cell lines
included the National Cancer Institute (NCI) 60-tumor cell line panel (14).

Immunohistochemistry of dewaxed tissue sections was done as described
previously (15). Antisera specific for RNF5 were applied followed by a goat
anti-rabbit secondary antibody (16). The immunostaining was scored as
per Krajewska et al. (17). The immunoscore was determined by visual
inspection (intensity X% = 300 as a maximal score translated as 3+ intensity
in 100% of cells).
RNF5 short interfering RNA and retroviral infections. The pSUPER.
retro vector was used to introduce short interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting
RNF5 and its corresponding scramble control into MCF-7, MDA-MB-231,
MDA-MB-435, and BT-474 cells. pSUPER.retro.shRnf5 or pSUPER.retro.
scramble infectious retroviral stock was generated in human 293T cells. The
above indicated cells were infected for 6 h with the addition of 5 Ag/mL
polybrene. After 48 h, cells stably expressing RNF5 siRNA were selected by
treatment with 2 Ag/mL puromycin. Alternatively, MCF-7 cells were
transfected with an oligonucleotide siRNA targeting RNF5 or a scramble
siRNA (Ambion) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM.

The histogram depicts percentage of RNF5 immunopositivity in these cell lines, as evaluated by visual inspection done by two independent readers, as detailed in
Materials and Methods and ref. 17. Inset, positive RNF5 staining for the OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cell line.

Three oligonucleotides targeting different sequences in the RNF5 gene were
used. The medium was changed 6 h after transfection and experiments were
done 48 h after transfection.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting cell cycle analysis. Cells at
approximately 50% to 60% confluence were treated for 24 h with DMSO,
5 Amol/L cytochalasin D, or 1 Amol/L paclitaxel (Sigma) for 24 h. Cells were
harvested, washed twice in PBS, and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol overnight
at 4jC. Cells were washed twice in PBS and then labeled with propidium
iodide solution (50 Ag/mL propidium iodide, 10 Ag/mL RNase A, 0.1%
sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 30 min at room temperature.
Fluorescent-stained cells were then transferred to polystyrene tubes with
cell strainer caps (BD Falcon) and subjected to fluorescence-activated cell
sorting using a Becton Dickinson FACScan. Acquisition and analysis of
cells containing sub-G1 DNA content (apoptotic cells) were done using
CellQuest 3.2 software (Becton Dickinson).
Cell proliferation. MCF-7 cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density
of 5,000 cells per well. After an overnight incubation, cells were treated with
20 AL CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Reagent (Promega). The cells were
further incubated at 37jC for 1 h and cell growth was quantified at an
absorbance of 480 nm on an Envision 2101 multilabel reader (Perkin-Elmer).
Confocal microscopy. MCF-7 cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed,
and permeabilized according to the protocol of Didier et al. (10). After
blocking in 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min, cells were incubated
with 100 AL of monoclonal antibodies directed against paxillin (Upstate) or

a-tubulin (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature followed by washing and
further incubation with a goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568–conjugated
secondary antibody and Alex Fluor 488–phalloidin (Invitrogen) for 1 h.
The coverslips were mounted on glass slides in ProLong Gold (Invitrogen)
and images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope
at 63 magnification.
Tissue microarrays. The breast cancer and melanoma tissue microarrays were constructed as described previously (18). Immunohistochemical
staining of the arrays with polyclonal antibodies against RNF5 was carried
according to the protocol of Chung et al. (19). The regions of most intense
staining were scored by eye for each spot. The staining was graded using the
following scale: 0, no staining; 1, weak staining; 2, moderate staining; and
3, intense staining. See Supplementary Materials and Methods for tissue
microarray construction and details.

Results
RNF5 expression is elevated in human cancers. A growing
number of ubiquitin ligases that are important regulators of
development and cell growth are found to be aberrantly expressed
in human tumors. To evaluate the expression pattern of RNF5 in
human tumors, we used a mRNA array that contained mRNA from
47 different tumors and their corresponding normal tissues

(Fig. 1A). For each tumor, the mRNA was spotted in duplicate. After
probing the array for RNF5 expression, the two duplicate spots
were averaged and then normalized to the expression levels of
the housekeeping gene GAPDH. As seen in Fig. 1B, seven different
tumors displayed at least a 2.5-fold increase in RNF5 mRNA levels.
RNF5 expression was markedly increased in several breast cancers,
with an f10-fold increase in breast intraductal carcinoma and an
f3-fold increase in breast adenocarcinoma. Marked increases in
RNF5 expression were also observed in lung cancer (f5-fold) and
esophageal cancer (f4-fold).
Next, we sought to confirm the results of the mRNA array by
examining RNF5 expression in breast cancer cell lines by reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis. As shown in Fig. 1C, RNF5
mRNA levels were increased f3.5-fold in several breast cancer cell
lines compared with HMECs, including MCF-7, BT-20, and BT-474
cells. These results were confirmed on the protein level via Western
blotting with antibodies directed against endogenous RNF5
(Fig. 1D). To confirm RNF5 protein expression in other cancers,
we generated and probed a cell microarray of the NCI 60-tumor cell
line panel. Consistent with the mRNA tumor array, strong RNF5
expression was seen in breast, colon, and lung cancer cell lines
(Fig. 2). In addition, RNF5 was strongly expressed in several
ovarian, renal, melanoma, and leukemia cell lines. Taken together,
these findings indicate that RNF5 is strongly expressed in many
different cancers and that RNF5 is up-regulated on the transcriptional level in several human breast cancers.
RNF5 siRNA enhances breast cancer cell apoptosis. To
examine the role of RNF5 in breast tumorigenesis, siRNA was used

to knock down RNF5 expression in several breast cancer cell lines,
including MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, and BT-474 cells.
The efficiency of siRNA targeting RNF5 was >80%, which was
confirmed in each experiment by Western blot (Fig. 3A and B).
Because RNF5 has been shown to regulate cell motility (10), we
assessed whether RNF5 altered breast cancer cell migration using
a pipette scratch assay. RNF5 siRNA did not have a significant
effect on the migratory capacity of any of the cell lines compared
with scramble siRNA (Supplementary Fig. S1; data not shown).
Consistent with this result, RNF5 knockdown did not affect paxillin
localization in MCF-7 cells (data not shown). These data suggest
that unlike nontransformed cultures, RNF5 does not affect paxillin
or cell migration in the breast cancer cells. Next, we examined
whether loss of RNF5 expression altered breast cancer cell death.
Knockdown of RNF5 expression did not induce apoptosis in
MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, or BT-474 cells (data not
shown). However, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and BT-474 cells expressing RNF5 siRNA displayed increased apoptosis on treatment with
the actin-disrupting agent cytochalasin D compared with scrambleexpressing cells (Fig. 3C). A similar enhancement of cytochalasin
D–induced apoptosis was observed for MCF-7 cells transfected
with three other siRNAs targeting different RNF5 sequences
(Supplementary Fig. S2). In addition, MDA-MB-435 cells expressing
RNF5 siRNA, which were less affected by cytochalasin, exhibited
greater sensitivity to treatment with the microtubule-targeting
drug paclitaxel compared with scrambled siRNA-expressing cells
(Fig. 3D). RNF5 siRNA also sensitized BT-474 cells, albeit to a lesser
degree, to paclitaxel treatment (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that

iodide, and DNA content was analyzed with a fluorescent-activated cell sorter. The sub-G1 DNA content indicates apoptotic cells. Error bars, SE of two to three

RNF5 contributes to the degree of sensitivity of breast cancer cells
to cytoskeletal-targeting anticancer agents.
Loss of RNF5 causes rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and decreased cell proliferation in MCF-7 cells. Because
loss of RNF5 expression sensitized breast cancer cells to
cytoskeletal-targeting agents, we examined the actin and microtubule architecture of breast cancer cells expressing scramble or
RNF5 siRNA. For MCF-7 cells growing asynchronously, no differences between the two cell lines were observed in the actin
cytoskeleton (Fig. 4A) or paxillin (data not shown) localization.
However, marked differences in the organization of actin
cytoskeleton were observed after serum starvation. Approximately
55% of scrambled siRNA-expressing MCF-7 cells retained their
network of actin fibers (Fig. 4A and B). In contrast, only 21% of
RNF5 siRNA-expressing MCF-7 cells were able to maintain their
actin cytoskeleton and displayed mainly peripheral actin staining
(Fig. 4A and B). After 2-h recovery in serum, both cell types began
to elongate back to their original morphology and RNF5 siRNA
cells were able to reestablish their actin cytoskeletal architecture.
Similar results were observed for MCF-7 cells transfected with
three other siRNAs targeting different RNF5 sequences (Supplementary Fig. S3). RNF5 siRNA did not affect MCF-7 cell

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (17). September 1, 2007

microtubule cytoskeletal organization under the above conditions
(Supplementary Fig. S3; data not shown). Of interest, analysis of
cytoskeletal proteins in melanoma cells that were subjected to
elevated RNF5 expression also revealed altered pattern of actin
expression (Supplementary Fig. S4), further noting the effect on
RNF5 on select cytoskeletal proteins. These data suggest that RNF5
contributes to cytoskeletal organization in MCF-7 cells.
To examine the effect of RNF5 on MCF-7 cell proliferation,
we used a colorimetric 3-(4-5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt (MTS) assay.
As shown in Fig. 4C, siRNA of RNF5 markedly decreased MCF-7 cell
proliferation compared with scrambled siRNA in both low (2%
FBS) and high (10% FBS) serum. Knockdown of RNF5 in MCF-7
cells transfected with three other siRNAs targeting different RNF5
sequences also decreased cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S5).
In contrast to these results in MCF-7 cells, RNF5 siRNA did not
affect the actin cytoskeletal architecture or cell proliferation of
MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, or BT-474 cells (Supplementary
Figs. S6 and S7). However, consistent with the increased apoptosis
in MDA-MB-435 cells induced by paclitaxel, MDA-MB-435 cells
displayed a reorganization of the microtubule architecture in asynchronously growing cells (Supplementary Fig. S6B). No differences

in microtubule architecture were observed for MDA-MB-231 or
BT-474 cells (Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6C). The differences
between cell lines may be due to the fact that MCF-7 cells express
wild-type p53 and MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, or BT-474 cells
either have mutations in or do not express p53 (20, 21).
To test the possibility that functional p53 is required for RNF5dependent effect on cytoskeletal architecture, we have inactivated
p53 in the MCF-7 cells and tested whether the changes seen above
would be attenuated. To this end, we have expressed the human
papilloma virus E6 protein, which is among the potent ligases for
p53. Knockdown of RNF5 in MCF-7 caused an increase in p53 levels

and expression of E6 in these cells caused efficient decrease in
p53 levels (Fig. 5A). Decrease of p53 levels in the MCF-7 cells
ameliorated the effects of RNF5 siRNA on MCF-7 cell proliferation
and actin cytoskeletal architecture (Fig. 5B and C). These data
suggest that RNF5 contributes to cytoskeletal organization and
affects cell proliferation in part via functional p53.
Decreased survival in breast cancers expressing RNF5. To
further investigate the significance of dysregulated RNF5 in human
cancers, we evaluated RNF5 expression in human breast cancer
specimens. Of the 655 breast cancer tumors on the tissue
microarrays, 479 (73%) were interpretable for cytoplasmic RNF5

In the melanoma arrays, high RNF5 expression was seen more
frequently in metastatic than in primary specimens (m2 = 5.7;
P = 0.017). No association was found with survival or other clinical
variables.

staining. Spots that were deemed uninterpretable had insufficient
tumor cells in the spot, loss of tissue in the spot, or an abundance
of necrotic tissue. Survival information was available for 424 (90%)
tumor cores. Examples of scores of positive and negative spots
are shown in Fig. 6A. High RNF5 staining was associated with
decreased survival (P = 0.0286). Kaplan-Meier survival curves,
using 20-year follow-up, are shown in Fig. 6B. Using the Cox
proportional hazards model, we did multivariate analyses. The
prognostic variables used included tumor size, nodal status,
estrogen receptor staining, progesterone receptor staining, Her2/
neu staining, nuclear grade, and patient age at diagnosis. RNF5 was
not an independent predictor of survival, and the only three
independent predictors of survival were nodal status, nuclear
grade, and tumor size.
Correlation between clinicopathologic variables and RNF5
staining was further examined. RNF5 staining was associated with
a nuclear grade of 2 or 3. Strong RNF5 staining was found in 66%
of high nuclear grade and 42% of low nuclear grade specimens
(m2 = 13; P = 0.0003) and had no significant associations with the
other variables.

In the current study, we show that the RING finger E3 ligase
RNF5 is up-regulated on the transcription level in breast cancer
and that loss of RNF5 expression sensitizes breast cancer cells to
cytochalasin D– and paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. RNF5 siRNA
also causes a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in response
to stress and a marked inhibition of cell proliferation in MCF-7
cells. Moreover, increased RNF5 expression in human breast cancer
specimens is associated with decreased survival. It is of interest
to note that noninvasive breast cancer (intraductal) has higher
RNF5 expression than invasive breast cancer, suggesting changes in
RNF5 expression (and likely activity) during select stages of breast
cancer development. These results suggest that RNF5 is a novel
regulator of breast cancer development and suggest that increased
expression of RNF5 may contribute to breast tumor progression.
Previously, we have shown that expression of RNF5 in nontransformed mouse fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells excludes paxillin from
the focal adhesions and inhibits cell migration (10). Here, we show
that RNF5 can modulate breast cancer apoptosis and plays a role
in promoting breast cancer progression. Whereas RNF5 is involved
in organization of the actin cytoskeleton, it does not seem to affect
cell migration or paxillin localization in the breast cancer cell
lines. Thus, RNF5 substrate(s) in the breast cancer and possibly
other tumor cells are different than those identified in the
nontransformed cells. The latter could be explained by different
post-translational modification of paxillin in the tumor cells or the
modification and activity of RNF5, aspects that deserve further
studies. In addition to the tumors with increased RNF5 expression
(Fig. 1B), we have identified several other tumors with decreased
RNF5 expression, which we are presently studying. In this manner,
RNF5 is expected to affect different cellular targets, which play an
important role in cytoskeletal organization and function. Because
RNF5 was also implicated in the clearance of malfolded proteins,
it is likely that RNF5 affects other targets in breast cancer cells
than those studied thus far.
It is important to delineate the mechanisms by which RNF5
modulates drug-induced apoptosis and regulates the actin
cytoskeleton and cell proliferation to promote tumor progression.
To this end, RNF5 may function somewhat similar to TRIM 32,
which has been shown to interact with myosin and to ubiquitinate
actin (22). Alternatively, RNF5 activity may affect Rho family of
GTPases, which are among key regulators of actin and microtubule
cytoskeleton (23) and which are often overexpressed or hyperactive
in human breast cancers (24). Along these lines, the ubiquitin E3
ligase Smurf1 targets RhoA for degradation at lamellipodia and
filopodia and is required for the morphology of transformed 293T
cells (25).
The tyrosine kinase Src also can alter cell morphology and the
actin cytoskeleton during tumorigenesis. A previous study has
shown that the ubiquitin E3 ligase Hakai ubiquitinates E-cadherin
and disrupts cell-cell contacts in epithelial cells in response to
Src activation (26). A recent study has also indicated that Src can
modulate sensitivity to paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity by phosphorylating caveolin-1 (27). Whether RNF5 is a regulator or an effector
of a Rho GTPase or a Src signaling network that reorganizes

RNF5 in Breast Cancer Progression

cytoskeletal architecture and enhances cell proliferation during
tumorigenesis remains to be determined.
The loss of RNF5 expression in MCF-7 cells led to a decrease in
cell proliferation and alterations in actin cytoskeleton in response
to stress but did not affect in either MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435,
or BT-474 cells. This may be attributable to the differences in p53
status in these cell lines, as only MCF-7 cells express a functional
p53 (20, 21). Further supporting this hypothesis was the finding
that reducing p53 levels in MCF-7 cells by the expression of E6
attenuated the effects of RNF5 siRNA on actin cytoskeleton and cell
proliferation. MCF-7 cells were also the most sensitized cell line to
cytochalasin D–induced apoptosis of the RNF5 siRNA-expressing
cells. Similar to this effect in breast cancer, p53 status can
modulate the sensitivity of non–small cell lung cancer cells to
gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (28). RNF5 may signal through the above-mentioned Rho
GTPase or Src networks or ERAD to inhibit p53, as loss of RNF5
expression also increased p53 expression in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5A).

Because RNF5 was strongly expressed in several different cancers
and RNF5 levels were higher in metastatic melanoma specimens
than primary tumors, increased RNF5 expression may be a
common event during tumor progression. Given its role in
modulating anticancer drug-induced apoptosis and its association
with clinical prognosis, RNF5 should be further assessed as a
marker and possible drug target in breast cancer.
