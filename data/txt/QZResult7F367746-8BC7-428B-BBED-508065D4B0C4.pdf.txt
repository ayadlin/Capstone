ABSTRACT
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have recently been shown to home to tumors
and contribute to the formation of the tumor-associated stroma. In addition,
MSCs can secrete paracrine factors to facilitate tumor progression. However, the
involvement of MSC-derived cytokines in colorectal cancer (CRC) angiogenesis and
growth has not been clearly addressed. In this study, we report that interleukin-8
(IL-8) was the most highly upregulated pro-angiogenic factor in MSCs co-cultured
with CRC cells and was expressed at substantially higher levels in MSCs than CRC
cells. To evaluate the effect of MSC-derived IL-8 on CRC angiogenesis and growth,
we used MSCs that expressed small hairpin (interfering) RNAs (shRNA) targeting
IL-8 (shIL-8-MSCs). We found that MSC-secreted IL-8 promoted human umbilical
vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation and migration, tube-formation ability
and CRC cell proliferation. Additionally, in vivo studies showed that MSCs promoted
tumor angiogenesis partially through IL-8. Taken together, these findings suggest
that IL-8 secreted by MSCs promotes CRC angiogenesis and growth and can therefore
serve as a potential novel therapeutic target.

tumor growth and metastasis, inhibiting tumor angiogenesis
is a promising strategy for limiting cancer progression [3].
Angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel
formation from pre-existing vessels, is vital to growth and
development [4]. During tumor progression, angiogenesis
is an essential pathologic feature of cancer, owing to its
important function in ensuring the delivery of oxygen
and nutrients to growing tumors [5]. Without an adequate

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the three most
common cancers worldwide, with more than 1.2 million new
cases, causing approximately 0.6 million deaths per year [1].
The 5-year-survival rate among early-stage CRC patients is
approximately 90%, a rate that drops to ~10% in patients with
distant metastases [2]. Because angiogenesis is necessary for

blood supply, a tumor cannot grow beyond 2–3 mm3 [6].
Recent research has identified a variety of cytokines that
are capable of regulating tumor angiogenesis, including
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast
growth factor (FGF), transforming growth factor beta
(TGF-β) and some CXC chemokines [7, 8].
Interleukin-8 (IL-8), also known as CXCL8 or
neutrophil-activating protein 1 (NAP-1), is a member of
the CXC chemokine family. The basic biological effect of
IL-8 is attracting and activating neutrophils [9]. IL-8 in the
tumor microenvironment has also recently been implicated
in promoting tumor progression. A number of studies have
demonstrated that IL-8 participates in cancer cell survival,
proliferation and invasion, as well as angiogenesis [9–12].
Endogenously produced IL-8 acts in an autocrine manner
to increase the growth of nasopharyngeal tumor spheres
and human melanoma cells [10, 11] and also participates
in the regulation of patient-derived breast cancer stem
cell activity [12]. IL-8 is the first chemokine described to
have pro-angiogenic properties, a function that has been
confirmed in a variety of tumor types, including ovarian
cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, and CRC
[8, 13–15].
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent
stromal cells that exhibit self-renewal ability and
multipotent differentiation potential [16]. MSCs,
which have been the subject of intense investigation,
participate in tumor pathogenesis [17]. Accumulating
evidence suggests that tumor progression partly depends
on interactions between cancer cells and stromal cells
[18]. Notably, in this context, bone marrow-derived
MSCs can be recruited to tumors, where they become
tumor-associated fibroblasts and constitute tumor stroma
[19, 20]. It has been established that paracrine signals from
cancer-associated stroma have a significant influence on
cancer cell behavior [18, 21, 22]. Additionally, MSCs
can secrete hundreds of factors, some of which stimulate
angiogenesis, such as VEGF, angiopoietin-2, IL-8 and
bFGF [23]. However, the mechanism underlying the proangiogenic effect of MSCs is still not fully understood.
As noted above, CRC cells can secrete IL-8, but
MSCs are also a source of IL-8. Therefore, which source
plays a dominant role in tumor progression is an important
open question. In this study, we examined the expression
of IL-8 in MSCs and CRC cell lines. We found that IL-8
expression in MSCs was substantially higher than in CRC
cell lines. Using IL-8-knockdown MSCs to explore the
functions of IL-8 secreted by MSCs, we further found that
IL-8 secreted by MSCs stimulates CRC angiogenesis and
growth in vitro and in vivo.

IL-8 expression is induced in MSCs following
interaction with CRC cells
Inflammation is a characteristic feature of the tumor
microenvironment [24]; accordingly, we first investigated
the influence of inflammatory cytokines on MSCs. To this
end, we performed genome-wide RNA-seq to assess the
changes in the expression of pro-angiogenic genes related
to the angiogenesis of MSCs treated with recombinant
IL-1β (30 ng/mL) and TNF-α (20 ng/mL; the global
transcriptional profiling data to be published elsewhere).
As shown in Figure 1A, MSCs from three different
donors expressed a series of angiogenesis-related factors,
including CCL2, CXCL12, TGFB1, CYR61, GREM1,
B4GALT1, VEGFA and FGF2. Among these genes, the
levels of IL-8 expression were increased 106.0-fold and
84.6-fold in MSCs stimulated with recombinant IL-1β and
TNF-α, respectively, compared with control cells. Because
IL-8 is a chemokine that promotes tumor angiogenesis,
we further analyzed the levels of secreted IL-8 protein
in MSCs treated with recombinant IL-1β (30 ng/mL)
and TNF-α (20 ng/mL) using ELISA. We observed an
8.02-fold and 6.44-fold promotion of IL-8 secretion,
respectively (Figure 1B).
Next, we studied the interactions in culture of
SW480, LS174T and HT29 human colorectal carcinoma
cells with MSCs. As shown in Figure 1C, IL-8 expression
was unchanged when CRC cells were co-cultured with
MSCs for 36 h. In contrast, IL-8 expression increased in
MSCs after co-culture. Notably, IL-8 mRNA expression,
normalized to β-actin mRNA, was dramatically different
between MSCs and CRC cells, with IL-8 mRNA levels
being 21.1–212.2-fold higher in MSCs than in CRC
cells. The higher and upregulated IL-8 mRNA levels in
MSCs supported the conclusion that MSCs were the main
source of IL-8. Furthermore, we measured the secretion
of IL-8 in the culture media from CRC cells and MSCs
separately. Minimal IL-8 production was observed in
the media from pure CRC cells, and markedly higher
IL-8 production was observed in the media from pure
MSCs. After 36 h of co-culture separated by a transwell
membrane, which allows the exchange of soluble factors
but prevents direct cell-cell contact, IL-8 levels increased
3.4–4.3-fold compared with untreated MSCs (Figure 1D).
Thus, IL-8 was induced in MSCs following interaction
with CRC cells, and the secretion of IL-8 in MSCs was
substantially higher than in CRC cells. Moreover, to
determine whether direct contact had an effect on CRC
cell-induced upregulation of IL-8 expression in MSCs,
we co-cultured GFP-expressing MSCs with CRC cells
in a direct co-culture system or a transwell system. After
36 h of co-culture, GFP-expressing MSCs in the direct
contact system were sorted by flow cytometry. Then,
the IL-8 expression of each group was determined by

quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (qRT-PCR). There was no increase in IL-8
expression in CRC cells after 36 h of co-culture in a
direct contact system. In contrast, IL-8 expression in
MSCs increased after co-culture in the direct contact
system. Notably, compared with the direct contact system,
the IL-8 expression levels of CRC cells and MSCs were
induced equally in the transwell system (Figure 1E). In
addition, ELISAs revealed no marked differences in IL-8
secretion of culture media between the transwell system
and the direct contact system (Figure 1F).

To address the influence of IL-8 on angiogenesis
in CRC, we further investigated the effect of IL-8
knockdown on cultured MSCs. Western blotting and
qRT-PCR assays indicated that IL-8 protein and mRNA
levels were decreased in MSCs transfected with a vector
expressing a short hairpin (inhibitory) RNA (shRNA)
targeting IL-8 (shIL-8-MSCs), respectively (data not
shown).

To ascertain whether IL-8 secreted by MSCs was
involved in CRC angiogenesis, we explored the effect of
IL-8 knockdown in MSCs on the proliferation, migration,
and tube-formation ability of human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVECs). To test cell proliferation, we
cultured HUVECs in the presence of conditioned medium
from CRC cells alone, CRC cell/MSC co-cultures, or
CRC cell/shIL-8-MSC co-cultures. Conditioned medium
from CRC cells had little stimulatory effect on HUVEC
proliferation, whereas conditioned medium from CRC
cell/MSC co-cultures effectively increased HUVEC
numbers. Notably, conditioned medium from CRC cell/
shIL-8-MSC co-cultures promoted a substantially smaller
increase in cell numbers compared with the CRC cell/
MSC co-cultures (Figure 2A). The mRNA levels of the

proliferation marker Ki-67 were consistent with the cell
count results (Figure 2B), as were the results obtained
using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays (Supplementary
Figure S2A & S2B).

MSC-secreted IL-8 induces HUVEC migration
and tube formation
To determine whether paracrine factors in
conditioned medium from CRC cell/MSC co-cultures
promoted HUVEC migration, we performed transwell
migration assays. These assays revealed that conditioned
medium from CRC cells alone promoted the migration of
only a small number of HUVECs. Compared with CRC
cells alone, conditioned medium from the co-culture groups

had a substantially greater effect on HUVEC migration.
However, the migration-stimulating effect of conditioned
medium from CRC cell/shIL-8-MSC co-cultures was
significantly less than that of conditioned medium from
CRC cell/MSC co-cultures (Figure 2C & 2D).
To confirm the angiogenesis-promotion function of
IL-8, we stimulated HUVECs with recombinant human
IL-8 (rhIL-8). As expected, rhIL-8 significantly induced
HUVEC proliferation, as assessed by CCK-8 and cell
count assays (Supplementary Figure S3A–S3C), and
stimulated a remarkable increase in HUVEC migration
(Supplementary Figure S3D).
Next, we investigated HUVEC tube-formation
ability, a functional property of endothelial cells. To this
end, we cultured HUVECs on Matrigel in the presence

of conditioned medium from CRC cells, CRC cell/
MSC co-cultures or CRC cell/shIL-8-MSC co-cultures.
Tube formation after a 4 h incubation, imaged by phasecontrast microscopy, is shown in Figure 3A. These assays
revealed that conditioned medium of CRC cell/MSC cocultures enhanced the tube-formation ability of HUVECs,
as measured by both the numbers and lengths of tubes
formed. Notably, tube-formation ability was decreased
using conditioned medium from CRC cell/shIL-8-MSC
co-cultures (Figure 3B). In addition, we detected the tubeformation ability of HUVECs after rhIL-8 stimulation.
Compared with the control group, the tube-formation ability
was increased after rhIL-8 stimulation (Supplementary
Figure S3E). Collectively, these results indicate that IL-8
secreted by MSCs stimulates tumor angiogenesis.

IL-8 secreted by MSCs promotes tumor cell
proliferation

yielded similar results (Figure 4B & 4C). In addition,
CRC cells grew faster after stimulation with recombinant
human IL-8 (Supplementary Figure S5A–S5C). These
results indicate that MSC-secreted IL-8 promotes CRC
cell proliferation in vitro.

In addition to assessing tumor angiogenesis, we
evaluated the influence of MSCs on CRC cell growth.
As shown in Figure 4A, MSCs promoted CRC cell
proliferation, as verified by CCK-8 assays (Supplementary
Figure S4A & S4B). The expression of proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Ki-67, markers of cell
proliferation, was elevated in CRC cells co-cultured with
MSCs but was little changed in CRC cells co-cultured with
shIL-8-MSCs (Supplementary Figure S4C). Consistent
with Ki-67 mRNA expression, immunostaining for Ki-67

To further test whether MSCs display enhanced
tumor angiogenic activity in vivo, we subcutaneously
injected 2 × 106 CRC cells or a mixture of 2 × 106 CRC
cells and 2 × 106 MSCs (parental or shIL-8–expressing)

into nude mice. After 4 weeks, the tumors obtained from
nude mice were further evaluated for vessel numbers
and microvessel density (MVD), determined by staining
for the endothelial marker CD31 (Figure 5A). As shown
in Figure 5B, there was an increase in MVD and vessel
numbers in tumors formed from CRC cell/MSC–derived
tumors compared with CRC cell–derived tumors.

In addition, both MVD and vessel numbers were decreased
in CRC cell/shIL-8-MSC–derived tumors compared with
CRC cell/ MSC–derived tumors. To further investigate
the change in IL-8 and other angiogenesis-related factors
participating in this process, we detected the mRNA
expression of IL-8, bFGF, VEGF and PDGF-BB in
tumor slides. We found that the mRNA levels of these

after 4 weeks and sectioned. The slides were stained with an anti-CD31 antibody for evaluating vessel morphology. Scale bar, 100 μm.
B. MVD was determined by measuring the percentage of each field occupied by a CD31-positive signal. The vessel numbers per field were
also counted. For each group, four randomly chosen high power fields per tumor (n = 5) were analyzed (*, p < 0.05). C. Total mRNA from

and weighed after sacrifice (*, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.01). F. Paraffin-embedded tumor tissue sections from xenografts were analyzed by

angiogenesis-related factors increased in CRC cell/MSC–
derived tumors compared with CRC cell–derived tumors.
Meanwhile, the mRNA levels of these angiogenesisrelated factors were decreased in CRC cell/shIL-8-MSC–
derived tumors compared with CRC cell/MSC–derived
tumors (Figure 5C). These results demonstrate that IL-8
knockdown results in a decrease in the pro-angiogenic
function of MSCs.
To evaluate tumor growth, tumors were measured
every week for 4 weeks (Figure 5D), and tumor
weights were measured after the mice were euthanized
(Figure 5E). Tumors formed from CRC cells coinjected with MSCs were clearly substantially larger
than those formed from CRC cells alone, whereas the
effect of shIL-8-MSCs on tumor growth was weaker
than that of parental MSCs. Furthermore, tumor
sections were examined for the expression of Ki-67 by
immunohistochemical staining. Representative sections
indicated a decrease in the number of Ki-67-positive
nuclei (brown stain) in CRC cell/shIL-8-MSC–derived
tumors compared with CRC cell/ MSC–derived tumors
(Figure 5F). Quantification of Ki-67-positive nuclei
across all sections revealed that, compared with the CRC
cell/shIL-8-MSC–derived tumors, IL-8 knockdown
caused a decrease in the number of Ki-67-positive cells
in the CRC cell/ MSC–derived tumors (Figure 5G).
These results suggest that IL-8 secreted by MSCs is an
important contributor to tumor growth.

also been suggested to correlate with the anti-angiogenic
process. In a mouse model of human glioma, MSCs have
been reported to downregulate the platelet-derived growth
factor (PDGF)/PDGF receptor axis in endothelial cells,
thereby inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and suppressing
tumor growth [31]. It has also been reported that high
numbers of MSCs are cytotoxic to endothelial cells,
suggesting a context in which MSCs might be an effective
anti-angiogenic therapy [32].
It has been well documented that tumors
are usually infiltrated by inflammatory cells and
inflammatory factors. IL-1β and TNF-α are the most
important inflammatory molecules involved in cancerrelated inflammation [33]. According to related studies,
recombinant IL-1β could induce approximately 100fold increases of IL-8 expression in MSCs that had been
treated for 48 h [34]. In addition, in the conditioned
medium of TNF-α-stimulated MSCs, secreted IL-8
was significantly increased approximately 50-fold
compared with pure MSCs [35]. In our model of MSCCRC cell interactions, our focus was on the primary
source of IL-8, an issue not specifically addressed
in other studies. For this purpose, we evaluated IL-8
mRNA and protein levels in MSCs and CRC cells
before and after co-culture. Our data showed that coculture increased IL-8 mRNA levels in MSCs, but had
virtually no effect on IL-8 mRNA levels in CRC cells.
In keeping with this, β-actin–normalized IL-8 levels in
MSCs were substantially higher than those in CRC cells.
ELISAs showed that pure CRC cells secreted minimal
IL-8, and pure MSCs secreted substantially more IL-8,
indicating that IL-8 secreted by MSCs is dominant in the
tumor microenvironment. These findings were further
confirmed by knocking down IL-8 in MSCs using a GFPshRNA construct that interferes with IL-8, which reduced
the pro-angiogenic ability of MSCs. Proliferation assays
further revealed that conditioned medium from CRC cell/
shIL-8-MSC co-cultures was less effective in promoting
HUVEC proliferation than conditioned medium from
CRC cell/MSC co-cultures. IL-8 knockdown in MSCs
similarly reduced the ability of conditioned medium
from co-culture to promote the migration and tubeformation ability of HUVECs. We also confirmed that
IL-8 is sufficient to produce these effects, showing that
stimulation with rhIL-8 induced HUVEC proliferation,
migration, and tube formation. To extend these results
to an in vivo setting, we injected nude mice with CRC
cells and MSCs or shIL-8-MSCs and evaluated the
angiogenesis features of the subsequently formed
tumors. We found that tumor MVD was substantially
higher in the CRC cell/MSC group. In conclusion, we
demonstrated that in co-culture of MSCs and CRC
cells, IL-8 secreted by MSCs is principally involved in
promoting angiogenesis in CRC.
Recent cancer therapy studies have suggested that
disturbing tumor-stroma interactions may help improve

DISCUSSION
Recent decades have witnessed a growing
appreciation of the importance of the contribution of
MSCs to the tumor microenvironment [25]. MSCs
can modulate immune responses, tumor angiogenesis,
metastasis and drug resistance, thereby affecting tumor
progression [26]. In CRC, it is well accepted that MSCs
can integrate into the tumor architecture, potentially
as carcinoma-associated fibroblasts [22]. However, the
mechanisms underlying the relationship between CRC
cells and MSCs have remained unclear. Our findings
provide the first demonstration that MSC-secreted IL-8,
rather than that secreted by CRC cells, is mainly involved
in stimulating tumor angiogenesis.
Studies have demonstrated that numerous cytokines
secreted by MSCs can induce angiogenesis during tumor
progression [27–29]. For example, bone marrow-derived
MSCs have been shown to migrate towards pancreatic
tumor cells and increase the sprouting of HUVECs,
a process mainly governed by the pro-angiogenic factor
VEGF [28]. In addition, MSC-secreted IL-6 increases
cancer cell secretion of endothelin-1 (ET-1), which then
stimulates endothelial cells to form new blood vessels
[30]. Our in vivo data clearly show that MSCs facilitate
tumor growth by enhancing angiogenesis via a mechanism
that depends on IL-8 secretion. However, MSCs have

treatment efficacy [36]. The idea of blocking tumor
angiogenesis as a cancer therapy strategy has achieved
prominence in recent decades. In physiological contexts,
such as development, wound healing and pregnancy,
normal vascular remodeling is sustained by a balance of
pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic signals. However,
under pathological conditions, such as cancer, the tumor
environment tilts toward to pro-angiogenic signals to
sustain an adequate blood supply [3]. Tumor angiogenesis
is influenced by numerous signaling molecules in the
tumor microenvironment [37]. Several anti-angiogenic
therapies directed at these molecules have been approved
by the Food and Drug Administration for treating cancer,
such as the humanized antibody Avastin (bevacizumab),
which targets VEGF-A, and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor
sorafenib, which targets Raf and VEGF and PDGF
receptors [38, 39]. However, clinical trials of these drugs
have not met early expectations, possibly reflecting the
fact that tumor angiogenesis is controlled by multiple
factors, some of which likely remain unidentified [40].
IL-8, which is also a pro-angiogenic factor, has only
recently come to be considered a therapeutic target.
IL-8 levels can also be a prognostic factor, reflecting
adenoma-carcinoma transition and metastatic potential
[41, 42]. Considerable evidence supports the hypothesis
that IL-8 promotes CRC progression [43, 44], and IL-8
pathways in cancer cells have been well documented
[9]. Accordingly, inhibiting IL-8 signaling in tumor
cells could have therapeutic potential in modulating
disease progression [45]. For example, SCH-527123,
a CXCR2 antagonist, blocks tumor angiogenesis and
proliferation and sensitizes tumor cells to chemotherapy
[46]. These observations suggest that new therapeutic
approaches directed towards IL-8 will likely have their
greatest curative effect if used in conjunction with other
monoclonal antibodies [45].
In summary, our results show that MSCs can
stimulate CRC angiogenesis and proliferation. This proangiogenic effect is likely primarily increased by IL-8,
and the paracrine action of MSC-derived IL-8 is dominant
compared with the autocrine action of CRC cell-produced
IL-8. Moreover, the rapid growth of tumors in nude mice
models is likely due, at least in part, to IL-8 secreted by
MSCs. Thus, by disrupting tumor-stroma interactions,
suppressing the secretion of IL-8 by MSCs may provide a
novel approach for CRC treatment.

MSCs were isolated from bone marrow aspirates
of healthy volunteers after receiving ethics approval and
informed consent. To demonstrate the multipotency of
shIL-8-MSCs, we cultured cells under conditions that
promote differentiation into osteogenic or adipogenic
lineages. Culturing in osteogenic medium for 2 weeks
induced the differentiation of MSCs into osteoblasts, as
confirmed by strong Alizarin Red S staining. Similarly,
Oil Red O staining revealed the presence of lipid
droplets in the cytoplasm of differentiated MSCs on
day 21 of adipogenic differentiation. In addition, PCR
results confirmed that shIL-8-MSCs had the ability
to differentiate into chondrocytes and adipocytes

and cultured in Endothelial Growth Medium-2 (EGM-2;
Lonza, USA). HUVECs were assayed at passages 4–6.
Human CRC cell lines (SW480, LS174T and HT29)
were obtained from ATCC and grown in high-glucose
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.

RNAi transfection
IL-8 expression was knocked down in MSCs by
transduction of a lentiviral vector expressing an shRNA
with the sequence 5′-CAAGAGAATATCCGAACTTTA-3′.
Lentiviruses were obtained by transfection of 293T cells.
MSCs at passage 2 or 3 were seeded into 6-well plates and
transfected with IL-8 shRNA using X-tremeGENE HP
reagent (Roche). Before experiments, GFP-positive cells
were purified by flow cytometry.

RNA sequencing
MSCs were treated with recombinant IL-1β
(30 ng/mL) and TNF-α (20 ng/mL) for 12 h (n = 3).
Then, RNA library preparation and sequencing were
performed as recommended by the manufacturer
(Genome Analyzer IIx; Illumina). Sequencing data were
processed using Consensus Assessment of Sequence and
Variation (CASAVA, version 1.8.2; Illumina) using the
default settings. In brief, clusters were located using the
raw images; cluster intensity and position parameters
were obtained as output; and the noise for each cluster

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents and antibodies
IL-8 was purchased from Prospec (USA). The
DyNAmo ColorFlash SYBR Green qRT-PCR kit was
purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Rutherford,
NJ, USA). qRT-PCR primers were designed using Oligo 7
and synthesized by Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA).

was estimated. The program determines the base
sequences read from each cluster, the confidence level
for each base, and whether the read passed filtering.
The resulting bcl files were converted into fastq.gz files.
Sequence reads were mapped to transcripts annotated
in the National Center for Biotechnology Information
database and used to calculate overall gene expression
in terms of RPKM (reads per kilobase of exon per
million mapped reads).

After trypsinization, cells were collected by centrifugation,
washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and
resuspended in 200 μL of PBS. Cells were then stained
with an equal volume of 0.4% trypan blue for 5 minutes at
room temperature. Viable cells (unstained) were counted
using a hemocytometer.

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was determined using a Cell
Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay kit. CRC cells were
plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/mL on 96-well plates
in culture medium (100 μL/well). After 4 h, 10 μL of
CCK-8 solution was added to the cells in 96-well plates
and incubated at 37°C for 0.5–4 h. The absorbance in
each well was quantified at 450 nm using a microplate
reader (Tecan Trading AG, Switzerland). Cell viability
was calculated according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. At least three experiments were performed,
each tested in triplicate.

qRT-PCR analyses
Total mRNA from tumor tissues or cells was
extracted using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and
complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using a
Quantitect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen) according
to the manufacturers’ protocols. Target mRNA levels
were quantified by performing qRT-PCR with a DyNAmo
ColorFlash SYBR Green qRT-PCR kit, as described by
the manufacturer, using the following primer pairs: human
IL-8, 5′-CTG GCC GTG GCT CTC TTG-3′ (forward)
and 5′-CCT TGG CAA AAC TGC ACC TT-3′ (reverse);
human Ki-67, 5′-CTT CCA GCA GCA AAT CTC A-3′
(forward) and 5′-ACA ATC AGA TTT GCT TCC GA-3′
(reverse); human PCNA, 5′-AGG CAC TCA AGG ACC
TCA TCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAG TCC ATG CTC TGC
AGG TTT-3′ (reverse); human bFGF, 5′- AGG GCA GAA
TCA TCA CGA AGT-3′ (forward) and 5′- AGG GTC TCG
ATT GGA TGG CA-3′ (reverse); human VEGF, 5′- CTC
GAT CCG CTC CTT TGA TGA-3′ (forward) and 5′- CGT
TGG TGC GGT CTA TGA G-3′ (reverse); and human
PDGF-BB, 5′- AGA AGA GCG ACC CTC ACA TCA-3′
(forward) and 5′- CGG TTA GCA CAC ACT CCT TTG-3′
(reverse). The thermocycling protocol for all experiments
was 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 10 s, annealing
at 60°C for 10 s, and extension at 72°C for 30 s. Target
mRNA levels were normalized to those of β-actin.

Cell migration assay
The migration ability of HUVECs was determined
using 24-well transwell chambers (8-μm-pore
membrane filters; Millipore) [47]. After rehydration of
the extracellular matrix (ECM) layer of the chambers
by incubating in serum-free media for 2 h, a 300-μL
suspension of HUVECs (1 × 105 cells/mL) in serum-free
medium was plated into the upper chamber. Then, the
lower chamber of the transwell chamber was filled with
500 μL of conditioned medium from CRC cells only,
CRC cell/MSC co-cultures, or CRC cell/shIL-8-MSC
co-cultures. After incubating the plates for 6 h, HUVECs
that had not migrated were gently removed from the
upper surface of the filters with a cotton-tipped swab, and
HUVECs that had migrated through to the lower chamber
were stained using the polyanionic dye Calcein AM from
the LIVE/DEAD Cell Viability Assay (Invitrogen), which
produces a green fluorescence in live cells. Images were
acquired under a fluorescence microscope. Cell counts are
expressed as the mean number of cells per field of view.
The counts of migrated cells were quantified from at least
five randomly selected fields from three independent
experiments at 200 x magnification by three independent
observers.

ELISA
Commercially available ELISA kits were used
for measuring IL-8 secretion in the culture media.
Cells were plated in 6-well plates and incubated at
37°C for 36 h. Then, equal volumes of cell culture
supernatants were collected. The quantification of
IL-8 protein was determined using the Quantikine IL-8
ELISA kit Neobioscience Technology Co, Ltd (Beijing,
China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The
concentration of IL-8 in culture media was determined
at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Tecan Trading AG,
Switzerland).

In vitro tube-formation assay
HUVEC tube-formation assays were performed
as previously described [48]. Briefly, 200 μL of growth
factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences), diluted 1:1 on
ice with cold DMEM, was loaded into each well of a 24well plate and allowed to polymerize for 30 minutes at
37°C. After culturing HUVECs with conditioned media
for 24 h, 5 × 104 cells were added to each well, and the

Cell counts

incubation at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 4 h. Tube formation
was evaluated by quantifying tube lengths and numbers
using the Angiogenesis Analyzer module in the ImageJ
toolkit.

followed by incubation at 4°C overnight with respective
primary antibodies. The slides were incubated for
10 minutes at room temperature with biotin-conjugated
secondary antibodies, followed by incubation with
streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase working solution for
10 minutes. Subsequently, sections were stained for 3 to 5
minutes with 3, 39-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride,
counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin, dehydrated, and
mounted.

Xenograft studies
The effect of MSCs on CRC growth and
angiogenesis in vivo was evaluated using a subcutaneous
xenograft tumor model, established by injecting the
flanks of 4-week-old male nude athymic mice with
CRC cells (2 × 106) mixed with or without MSCs or
shIL-8-MSCs (1:1, 2 × 106 each). Five mice were used
in each group. Tumor volumes were calculated using
the formula: tumor volume (mm3) = 0.5 × width2 ×
length. After 4 weeks, the mice were euthanized, and
tumors were excised for weighing and subsequent
experimentation. All animal studies were performed
according to the guidelines of the Sun Yat-sen University
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Statistical analyses
All experiments were performed at least three
separate times. Outcome measures were expressed as the
mean ± SEM. Comparisons among/between groups were
performed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
or Student’s t-test. CCK-8 and tumor growth curves were
tested using repeated ANOVA followed by post-hoc test.
P-values < 0.05 were considered significant.
