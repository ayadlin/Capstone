Abstract
Continued androgen receptor (AR) signaling is an established mechanism underlying castration-resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC), and suppression of androgen receptor signaling remains a therapeutic goal of CRPC
therapy. Constitutively active androgen receptor splice variants (AR-Vs) lack the androgen receptor ligandbinding domain (AR-LBD), the intended target of androgen deprivation therapies including CRPC therapies
such as abiraterone and MDV3100. While the canonical full-length androgen receptor (AR-FL) and AR-Vs
are both increased in CRPCs, their expression regulation, associated transcriptional programs, and
functional relationships have not been dissected. In this study, we show that suppression of ligandmediated AR-FL signaling by targeting AR-LBD leads to increased AR-V expression in two cell line models of
CRPCs. Importantly, treatment-induced AR-Vs activated a distinct expression signature enriched for cellcycle genes without requiring the presence of AR-FL. Conversely, activation of AR-FL signaling suppressed
the AR-Vs signature and activated expression programs mainly associated with macromolecular synthesis,
metabolism, and differentiation. In prostate cancer cells and CRPC xenografts treated with MDV3100 or
abiraterone, increased expression of two constitutively active AR-Vs, AR-V7 and ARV567ES, but not AR-FL,
paralleled increased expression of the androgen receptor–driven cell-cycle gene UBE2C. Expression of ARV7, but not AR-FL, was positively correlated with UBE2C in clinical CRPC specimens. Together, our ﬁndings
support an adaptive shift toward AR-V–mediated signaling in a subset of CRPC tumors as the AR-LBD is
rendered inactive, suggesting an important mechanism contributing to drug resistance to CRPC therapy.

Introduction
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for advanced prostate
cancer is designed to disrupt the androgen receptor (AR)
pathway (1). The intended therapeutic target is the full-length
androgen receptor (AR-FL), complete with an intact ligandbinding domain (LBD). Prostate tumors that progress despite

ﬁrst-line ADT (e.g., LHRH analogues), generally termed castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), frequently show
continued androgen receptor signaling driven by intratumoral
androgens as well as elevated levels of AR-FL (2, 3). In support
of the importance of ligand-driven AR-FL signaling in CRPCs, a
number of clinically effective endocrine therapies targeting
AR-LBD were recently developed to treat patients with CRPCs
(e.g., abiraterone, MDV3100; refs. 4, 5). Nevertheless, the majority of patients progress shortly after treatment, again with
reactivated androgen receptor signaling (4, 5).
Androgen receptor splice variants that lack the functional
LBD (AR-Vs) were recently decoded and characterized (6–11),
with some (e.g., AR-V7, ARV567ES; refs. 7, 9, 10) but not all (8)
facilitating ligand-independent androgen receptor signaling in
CRPCs. AR-Vs originate from androgen receptor transcripts
with insertions of cryptic exons downstream of the coding
sequences for androgen receptor DNA-binding domain (DBD;
refs. 6, 9–11), or with deletions of exons coding for AR-LBD (7,
8). These alterations in androgen receptor transcripts disrupt
the androgen receptor open reading frame, leading to truncated androgen receptor proteins with the intact N-terminal
domain (NTD), AR-DBD, and a short variant-speciﬁc peptide
replacing the functional AR-LBD. AR-Vs are capable of

activating canonical AR-FL–regulated genes (e.g., KLK3,
TMPRSS2, NKX3.1) in the absence of AR-FL signaling (6–11),
raising the possibility that AR-Vs and AR-FL may direct a
similar transcriptional program and that elevated AR-Vs in
CRPC may compensate for AR-FL signaling. However, previous
studies also suggest that AR-Vs are not as potent as AR-FL in
inducing the expression of AR-FL genes (9). Because AR-FL and
AR-Vs are both overexpressed in CRPCs and AR-Vs are less
abundant than AR-FL (6, 9), the role of ligand-independent
androgen receptor signaling in the context of suppressed, yet
still active, AR-FL signaling is not clear. In addition, regulation
of expression of endogenous AR-Vs and their functional relationships with AR-FL signaling have not been discerned in the
context of ADTs. In this study, we used a set of detection and
targeting tools that differentiate the AR-FL and AR-Vs to
investigate the functional interplay and distinctions between
AR-FL and AR-V. The cumulative in vitro and in vivo evidence
supports the importance of AR-V–mediated signaling in mediating responses to CRPC therapies targeting AR-LBD.

Materials and Methods
Cell line models and treatments
LNCaP, CWR22Rv1, and VCaP human prostate cancer cell
lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Early-passage cells were used in all experiments. LNCaP95
is an androgen-independent cell line derived from the parental
LNCaP cells (provided by Dr. Alan K. Meeker, Johns Hopkins

3458

Cancer Res; 72(14) July 15, 2012

University, Baltimore, MD). LNCaP95 cells and the parental
LNCaP cells show qualitatively similar androgen receptor
transcriptional responses (Supplementary Fig. S1). Previous
studies have evaluated and established the expression status
for both AR-FL and AR-V in these 4 cell lines (9). Stable clones
of AR-FL–positive and -negative LNCaP cells were developed
by E. Bluemn (Supplementary Methods). In all comparisons
involving the treatment of cells with or without R1881 (NEN),
cells were cultured for indicated time periods in culture media
without phenol red (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS (CSS; Invitrogen) with or without 1 nmol/L
R1881 (NEN). For siRNA treatment, cells reaching approximately 70% conﬂuence were treated with siRNA for 24 hours
and then cultured for 48 hours with or without 1 nmol/L R1881.
Target sequences for speciﬁc knockdown of different androgen
receptor molecules were described previously (9). MDV3100
was obtained from Medivation. VCaP and LNCaP95 cells were
treated with MDV3100 dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
at the indicated concentrations for 24 hours with or without 1
nmol/L R1881 (NEN). Transient transfection with AR-Vs was
conducted as described previously (7–9).
Western blot analysis
Antibodies used in this study include anti-AR N20 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology); anti-AR-V7 and anti-PSA (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology); anti-ERG (C-17, Santa Cruz Biotechnology);
anti-UBE2C (Boston Biochem); and anti-b-actin (SigmaAldrich). The anti-AR-V7 antibody is a mouse monoclonal

CRPC xenografts
Abiraterone-treated xenograft tumor samples derived from
the LuCaP35CR xenograft line was obtained from E.A. Mostaghel. Detailed methods for treatment, tumor collection, and
mRNA analysis were fully described previously (13).
Tissue microarray analysis
CRPC tissues on the tissue microarray (TMA) were procured
as previously described (14). Immunohistochemical staining
for AR-V7, AR-FL, and UBE2C was optimized and conducted
by J. Edwards. Deparafﬁnized TMA slides were placed in
10 mmol/L Tris, 1 mmol/L EDTA (pH 9.0) and steamed for
40 minutes for antigen retrieval. The primary antibodies were
incubated with each slide for 1 hour at room temperature. The
EnVision reagent (DAKO Corp.) was used for color development. Protein expression levels were scored by a semi-automated method as previously described (15). Scoring data were
analyzed using SPSS (SPSS Inc.) and GraphPad (GraphPad
Software, Inc.).

Results and Discussion
Regulation of AR-V expression by AR-FL
AR-FL and AR-V are both overexpressed in clinical CRPC
specimens (9) and induced in castrate conditions in CRPC
xenografts (6), suggesting that increased AR-V levels may be
coupled with enhanced transcription of the androgen receptor
gene and that AR-V function may require the presence of ARFL (6). Because individual AR-V levels are typically lower than

3460

Cancer Res; 72(14) July 15, 2012

AR-FL (6, 8, 9), we used 2 cell lines, LNCaP95 and VCaP, that
recapitulate the relative expression levels of AR-FL and ARVs in clinical CRPC specimens, that is, detectable but lower
levels of AR-Vs than AR-FL (9). AR-FL signaling in the
presence of R1881 was suppressed (Fig. 1A) by siRNA targeting the AR-LBD (AR-LBD siRNA), by ligand depletion
(R1881–), or by MDV3100, a potent anti-androgen that
targets the AR-LBD (4). We show that suppression of
ligand-mediated AR-FL signaling by all 3 of these AR-LBD
targeting strategies leads to an increase of the aggregate ARV signal (AR-Vs; Fig. 1A). Increased AR-V protein expression
following suppression of AR-LBD was conﬁrmed by an
increase in AR-V7, as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig.
1A) and immunoﬂuorescent staining (Fig. 1B) using a variant-speciﬁc monoclonal antibody (Supplementary Fig. S2).
We conclude that AR-V protein expression may not parallel
expression of AR-FL following suppression of AR-FL signaling (Fig. 1A). Instead, AR-V protein levels are negatively
regulated by ligand-mediated AR-FL signaling irrespective of
the AR-FL protein levels, suggesting an adaptive shift toward
AR-V–mediated signaling after therapy targeting AR-LBD.
Distinctive transcriptional programs mediated by AR-FL
and AR-Vs
To dissect the transcriptional programs induced by AR-V–
mediated signaling, we took 2 approaches: ﬁrst, we examined
transcriptional changes driven by forced expression of AR-Vs
in the presence or absence of AR-FL signaling by Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis (12). Transient expression of exogenous
AR-V7 in parental LNCaP cells (Supplementary Fig. S3)
induced expression of cell-cycle genes, under both androgen-depleted and -stimulated conditions (Supplementary
Fig. S4). On the other hand, top gene sets increased by

Transcriptional Programs Mediated by AR-V

Correlation between AR-V and UBE2C after treatment
with MDV3100 and abiraterone
The AR-V7 UP gene set included UBE2C (Fig. 2). Previous
studies established a direct regulation of UBE2C expression by
androgen receptor in LNCaP-abl cells under androgendeprived conditions (16). Our ﬁndings (Fig. 2) suggest that
UBE2C expression in our CRPC models may be driven by AR-Vs
but not by AR-FL. To validate the relationship between UBE2C
and AR-V expression following suppression of AR-FL signaling,
we ﬁrst show that in LNCaP95 cells treated with MDV3100,
the expression of UBE2C parallels that of AR-Vs but not AR-FL
(Fig. 3A). Both AR-FL and constitutively active AR-Vs are
elevated in the LuCaP35CR xenografts following treatment
with abiraterone (13). We further show that in those abiraterone-treated xenografts, AR-Vs, but not AR-FL, are signiﬁcantly
correlated with UBE2C and other cell-cycle genes at mRNA
levels (Fig. 3B and 3C; Supplementary Table SI). From these

ligand-dependent AR-FL are dominated by those related to
biosynthesis, metabolism, and secretion (Supplementary Fig.
S5). For illustration, we generated 2 gene sets, AR-V7 UP and
AR-FL UP, each containing 25 probes that contributed to the
core enrichment of top ranked gene sets driven by AR-V7 and
AR-FL. The 2 representative gene sets show clearly independent expression patterns (Fig. 2A). Other canonical AR-FL–
regulated genes (KLK3, TMPRSS2, NKX3.1) follow the same
pattern as those in the AR-FL UP gene set (not shown). To
further determine whether expression of the AR-V genes
requires the presence of endogenous AR-FL, we generated
stable LNCaP clones with or without endogenous AR-FL
protein (Supplementary Methods), and transiently transfected
these clones with AR-V7 or ARV567ES in androgen-deprived
conditions (Supplementary Figs. S6 and S7). In this independent series of expression proﬁles (Fig. 2B), the AR-V7 UP gene
set remains as the top-ranked gene set induced by ARV567ES
or AR-V7 (not shown), and the absence of endogenous AR-FL
did not attenuate induction of the AR-V7 UP signature (Fig. 2B;
Supplementary Fig. S8). Thus, the presence of AR-FL is not
required for induction of cell-cycle genes by constitutively
active AR-V7 and AR-V567ES.
As a second approach to further corroborate the functional
distinctions between AR-FL and AR-Vs, we analyzed gene
expression correlates of endogenous AR-Vs following suppression of canonical AR-FL signaling only or suppression of both
AR-FL and AR-Vs (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Figs. S9–S12). In
LNCaP95 cells, the AR-V7 UP signature is again the top gene
set enriched for upregulation following an increase of endogenous AR-V7 induced by AR-FL suppression (Supplementary
Fig. S11). Knockdown of both AR-FL and AR-Vs abrogated
expression of the AR-V7 UP gene set (Fig. 2C), conﬁrming the
essential role of AR-Vs. In contrast, the canonical AR-FL target
genes showed a change of direction opposite to those driven
by AR-V, with the AR-FL UP gene set as the top-ranked gene
set enriched for downregulation following suppression of
AR-FL (Supplementary Fig. S11). Increased expression of the
AR-V7 UP gene set was further conﬁrmed in VCaP cells
following suppression of AR-FL signaling by either AR-LBD
siRNA or MDV3100 (Supplementary Fig. S12).

ﬁndings (Figs. 1–3), we reason that an adaptive shift toward
AR-V–mediated signaling may contribute to resistance to
MDV3100 and abiraterone.
In vivo correlation between AR-V and UBE2C in CRPC
Suppression of AR-FL does not induce AR-V expression in
the parental LNCaP and CWR22RV1 cells (Supplementary Fig.
S13), in which high levels of AR-V7 may be caused by genomic
alterations not frequently seen in clinical specimens (17).
Consistent with the role of AR-V, we did not observe increased
cell-cycle gene expression after suppression of AR-FL signaling
in these 2 cell lines (not shown). Thus, cell-type–speciﬁc
regulation of endogenous AR-V expression may explain why
suppression of AR-FL inhibits tumor growth in some models of
CRPC but not the others (6). Our results nevertheless suggest
that AR-Vs, rather than AR-FL, may play a key role in supporting castration-resistant growth in at least a subset of CRPC. We
investigated the relative importance of AR-FL and AR-V in vivo
by immunohistochemistry analyzing the correlation between
AR-FL and UBE2C, and between AR-V7 and UBE2C, in

transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) specimens
derived from patients who developed obstructive urinary
symptoms after hormone therapy (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig.
S14 and Supplementary Table SII). AR-V7, but not AR-FL, is
signiﬁcantly correlated with UBE2C (Fig. 4B and C), further
supporting that AR-Vs, rather than AR-FL, mediate cell-cycle
gene expression in at least a subset of CRPC specimens. This
protein expression data are consistent with ﬁndings from an
mRNA-based study showing elevated cell-cycle gene expression that are detected in bone metastasis express high levels of
AR-Vs (18).
In summary, this study reveals the functional interplay
between AR-FL and AR-Vs when AR-LBD is rendered inactive
by ADTs. Importantly, the combined in vitro and in vivo data
predict an adaptive shift toward AR-V–mediated signaling
with effective CRPC therapies targeting AR-LBD. These studies
indicate that therapeutic efﬁcacy of agents targeting AR-LBD
may be compromised as a consequence of this adaptive shift
and that early detection of this shift may be used to guide
treatment decisions. In addition, novel agents for CRPCs (19)
may be designed to suppress the activation of transcriptional
programs directed by the AR-Vs. Overall, given the recently
expanded therapeutic options for metastatic CRPCs (20), the
present ﬁndings may stimulate efforts to target adaptive AR-V
signaling for treatment selection and to overcome resistance to
CRPC therapy.
