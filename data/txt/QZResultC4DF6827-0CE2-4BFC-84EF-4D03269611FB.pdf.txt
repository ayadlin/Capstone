BACKGROUND: Endothelin-1 and the endothelin A (ETA) receptor have been implicated in prostate cancer progression in bone. This
study aimed to determine whether the specific ETA receptor antagonist, zibotentan, prolonged overall survival (OS) in patients with
castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases who were pain-free or mildly symptomatic for pain. METHODS: Patients
were randomized 1:1 to zibotentan 10 mg/day or placebo, plus standard prostate cancer treatment. The primary endpoint was OS.
Secondary endpoints included times to pain progression, chemotherapy use, new bone metastases, and safety. Efficacy endpoints
were analyzed using a log-rank test. RESULTS: A total of 594 patients were randomized (zibotentan, n ¼ 299; placebo, n ¼ 295).
Median OS was 24.5 months in zibotentan-treated patients versus 22.5 months for placebo, but the difference did not reach statistical
significance (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95.2% confidence interval, 0.69-1.10; P ¼ .240). No statistically significant differences were observed
for any secondary efficacy endpoints. Peripheral edema (44%) and headache (31%) were the most commonly reported adverse
events in the zibotentan group. Cardiac failure events were higher in the zibotentan group than placebo (any grade, 5.7% and 1.7%;
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3, 3.0% and 1.0%, respectively); these were manageable and reversible.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial, treatment with zibotentan 10 mg/day did not lead to a
statistically significant improvement in OS in this patient population. Zibotentan had an acceptable safety profile. Cancer

Prostate cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide and accounts for almost 10% of all male cancer
deaths in the developed world.1 Although death rates for patients with prostate cancer have been decreasing in many developed countries, in part because of improved early detection and treatment options,1 patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) have a poor prognosis with limited therapeutic options.2 The disease state is defined by evidence of
prostate cancer progression, despite serum testosterone being controlled below a castrate level.2
The potent vasoconstrictor, endothelin-1 (ET-1) appears to contribute to prostate cancer progression, particularly
in bone.3 ET-1 has been detected in nearly every primary and metastatic prostate cancer, independent of the hormonal milieu.4 Acting through the endothelin A (ETA) receptor, ET-1 is causal in the osteoblastic response of bone, contributing to
the vicious cycle of cancer progression.5 Neutral endopeptidase, the enzyme responsible for local clearance of bioactive
peptides such as ET-1, is significantly decreased with androgen deprivation,6 adding to the pathologic effects of ectopic
ET-1 secretion in CRPC. Acting through the ETA receptor, ET-1 is an inhibitor of apoptosis in a variety of cell types,
including prostate cancer.7 Resistance to androgen deprivation–induced apoptosis is the distinguishing feature of CRPC.
Collectively, these observations support the rationale for specific inhibition of the ETA receptor for the treatment of
patients with CRPC.
Zibotentan (ZD4054), an oral-specific ETA receptor antagonist, was studied in a phase 2 study of patients with
CRPC and bone metastases who were pain-free or mildly symptomatic for pain.8,9 The primary endpoint, time to disease
progression, was not met, but a signal for prolonged overall survival (OS) was observed in patients receiving zibotentan
compared with placebo. The aim of this phase 3 study was to determine the efficacy and safety of zibotentan in a similar
but larger population of patients with metastatic CRPC (clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT00554229). This study was part

of the large international phase 3 ENTHUSE (EndoTHelin A USE) program, which also included studies of zibotentan in combination with docetaxel in metastatic
CRPC and as monotherapy in patients with nonmetastatic CRPC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Eligible patients had pathologically-confirmed prostate
cancer who had undergone surgical or continuous medical
castration (gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues,
luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues, or
estramustine) with serum testosterone 2.4 nmol/L (70
ng/dL; lower limit of quantification in many centers taking part in this trial) and had metastatic disease with documented
biochemical
progression.
Biochemical
progression was defined as 2 stepwise increases in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels over a period of 1
month with 14 days between each measurement; the
last PSA measurement had to be an increase of 50% or
an absolute increase of 10 ng/mL over the initial PSA
value. The final PSA value had to be 1.2 ng/mL in
patients who had undergone a radical prostatectomy and
5 ng/mL in all other patients. Other inclusion criteria
were evidence of bone metastases on radionuclide bone
scan (disease involvement <75% of the spine, pelvis, and
ribs; confirmation by computed tomography, magnetic
resonance imaging scan, or x-ray was required for 3
lesions), asymptomatic/mild pain from prostate cancer
(defined as a score of 2 in the ‘‘worst pain’’ item of the
Brief Pain Inventory [BPI]), World Health Organization
performance status of 0/1, and adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function. Patients were ineligible if they
had received any of the following therapies: cytotoxic
chemotherapy for recurrent prostate cancer; targeted anticancer therapies; endothelin receptor antagonists; systemic retinoids or potent cytochrome P450 inducers
within 2 weeks of starting study treatment; radiotherapy
to bone lesions or prostatic bed, or any anticancer investigational drug within 4 weeks of starting study treatment;
radionuclide therapy within 12 weeks of starting study
treatment. Additional exclusion criteria were evidence of
impending spinal cord compression, known/suspected
central nervous system metastases, cardiac failure (New
York Heart Association class II) or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, hemoglobin <9 g/dL, or
creatinine clearance <50 mL/minute.
All patients provided written informed consent. The
institutional review boards or independent ethics committees of all investigational sites approved the protocol.

Study Design

Patients were stratified by center and randomized 1:1,
using an interactive voice response system, to receive zibotentan 10 mg/day po (by mouth) or placebo (Fig. 1).
Study treatment was blinded using the unique code generated during randomization. Patients could receive the following standard supportive/palliative care: regular followup; chemotherapy; symptomatic therapy for pain control;
steroids; bisphosphonates and second-line hormonal
manipulations including anti-androgens, estramustine,
ketoconazole, megestrol, and estradiol. Other experimental agents were not permitted. Patients continued
randomized treatment until a withdrawal criterion was
met.

Study Endpoints and Evaluations

The primary endpoint was OS, defined as time to death
from any cause. Key secondary efficacy endpoints
included time to pain progression (time to change in pain
due to metastases [defined as an increase from baseline to
a minimum worst pain BPI score of 5 with no decrease in
analgesic use] or death); time to opiate use (opiate use for
1 week for pain due to prostate cancer metastasis); skeletal-related events (pathological fracture; vertebral compression fracture not related to trauma; prophylactic
surgery or radiation for impending fracture or spinal cord
compression; spinal cord compression); time to chemotherapy use, or death; time to new bone metastases (time
to appearance of 4 new bony lesions confirmed by bone
scan or death); progression-free survival (PFS; time from
randomization until clinical progression of disease
[defined as any of the following: increased pain, as defined
above; skeletal-related event; objective progression of visceral or nodal disease (modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.0); 4 new
bony lesions confirmed by bone scan; or death from any
cause in the absence of progression]); and time to PSA
progression (time to the first PSA value 50% from baseline, seen in 2 consecutive PSA values). Health-related
quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed according to the
functional well-being domain of Functional Assessment
of Cancer Therapy for Prostate cancer (FACT-P) and
total FACT-P score. Symptoms were assessed using the 8item FACT-P symptom index (FAPSI-8). Adverse events
(AEs) were monitored throughout the study and were
graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3.0. Safety data were
reviewed regularly by an independent data monitoring
committee (IDMC).

Statistical Analysis

Recruitment of 580 patients was planned; 263 deaths
were required for formal analysis. Based on a recruitment
period of 18 months and a predicted median OS for the
placebo group of approximately 19 months, 263 deaths
were estimated to occur approximately 30 months after
the first patient had entered the study. If the true hazard
ratio (HR) for zibotentan versus placebo was 0.67, the
analysis would have 90% power to demonstrate a statistiCancer

cally significant effect in OS at the 5% level. For the primary endpoint of OS, the nominal significance level of
5% was adjusted to 4.8% to allow for a single interim
analysis.
The efficacy and HRQoL analyses included all
patients randomized and the safety analyses included
all patients who received 1 dose of study medication. Efficacy endpoints were analyzed using a logrank test.

HRQoL

There were no statistically significant differences in time
to deterioration of either HRQoL (FACT-P; HR, 1.01;
95% CI, 0.85-1.21; P ¼ .890) or symptoms (FAPSI-8;
HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.86-1.24; P ¼ .707) between treatment groups.

Safety

Zibotentan treatment was generally well tolerated; the
median duration of treatment exposure was 9.5 (range,
0.1-30.6) months for zibotentan and 11.0 (range, 0.129.0) months for placebo.
Common AEs that occurred more frequently in the
zibotentan arm included peripheral edema (44.3% versus
19.0%), headache (31.2% versus 12.5%) and nasal congestion (16.1% versus 3.1%; Table 3). Both arms showed
a similar incidence of grade 3 events (42.3% zibotentan,
40.7% placebo; Table 4). The most common grade 3
events were anemia (5.4% zibotentan, 2.7% placebo) and
neutropenia (3.4% zibotentan, 4.4% placebo). Neutropenia events were generally reported in patients receiving
chemotherapy. Overall, 32.9% and 35.6% of patients in
the zibotentan and placebo groups, respectively, had serious AEs (SAEs); the most frequently reported in the zibotentan group were pneumonia, cardiac failure, and
anemia (2.0% of patients each), and pulmonary embolism
(1.7%). There were 14 deaths due to AEs in the zibotentan group versus 26 with placebo. AEs leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in 23.2% of patients
receiving zibotentan and 12.9% receiving placebo (Table
5); this difference primarily reflects the higher rates of peripheral edema and nasal congestion leading to discontinuation in the zibotentan arm.
Cardiac failure events were higher in the zibotentan
group (any grade, 5.7%; grade 3, 3.0%) than placebo
(any grade, 1.7%; grade 3, 1.0%). In the zibotentan
group, of the 17 patients with cardiac failure events, all
but 1 patient received treatment and most events (14)
resolved either without interrupting treatment (n ¼ 4), or
after temporary or permanent discontinuation (n ¼ 4 and
6, respectively); 8 of 17 events were considered to be
SAEs. There was a sustained 5 mm Hg greater reduction
in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the zibotentan group compared with placebo, but no increase in
pulse or weight. Generally, there were no differences in
hematology laboratory parameters between the treatment
arms. However, a sustained decrease in mean hemoglobin
levels of 1.0 to 1.5 g/dL was reported in the zibotentan
group.

DISCUSSION
The addition of zibotentan 10 mg/day to best supportive
care did not result in a significant improvement in OS in
this study of patients with CRPC and bone metastases
who were pain-free or mildly symptomatic for pain (HR,
0.87; CI, 0.69-1.10; P ¼ .24; median OS, 24.5 months vs

22.5 months). These data are disappointing, and confound the promising OS signal observed in a randomized
phase 2 study of zibotentan in a similar patient population.9 There are, however, notable differences between the
phase 2 and phase 3 trials, which should be considered
when designing and conducting future clinical trials in
CRPC.
First, the primary endpoint in the phase 2 study was
time to progression, not OS.8 After observing an increased
OS at the primary analysis, two additional analyses were

planned for the times at which a minimum of 110 (data
cutoff February 2007) and 200 (data cutoff December
2008) deaths had occurred.8,9 This phase 3 study was
designed and initiated, based on the outcome of the second analysis (110 deaths), where median OS was 17.3
months for placebo and 24.5 months for zibotentan 10
mg. At the final analysis (200 deaths), the difference in
median OS had narrowed: 19.9 months for placebo, 23.5
months for zibotentan 10 mg.9 In hindsight, the phase 2
study would have benefited from an OS primary endpoint
and a more complete follow-up; the phase 3 study may
also provide a good example of regression to the mean.

appropriate when designing a pivotal trial with a previously untested primary endpoint. A much larger study
would have been required to demonstrate significance
and, even in that setting, it is reasonable to question
whether a 2-month OS difference is clinically meaningful
in CRPC.
Second, the placebo group in the phase 3 study
survived longer than expected. The trial was designed
based on the published median OS for patients with
metastatic CRPC of approximately 19 months.10 The
better survival is consistent with other, more recent,
data from phase 3 trials in CRPC: in a sipuleucel-T
study, median OS for placebo was 21.7 months.11 As
defined—CRPC patients with bone metastases who
were pain-free or mildly symptomatic for pain—the
inclusion criteria may have been too broad to select a
5715

homogeneous population for study. Future trial
designs will benefit from an improved understanding
of CRPC disease progression.
Third, median drug exposure in the phase 2 study
was shorter (3.7 months for placebo, 4.3 months for zibotentan 10 mg) and data about subsequent systemic anticancer therapy usage were available for less than half of
patients.8,9 Subsequent use of anticancer therapy following start of study treatment in the phase 2 trial was balanced between arms (placebo, 44.9%; zibotentan 10 mg,
52.3%) and was lower than in this phase 3 trial (72.9%,
both arms). In our study, similar proportions of patients
received subsequent anticancer therapy, including chemotherapy (placebo, 26.8%; zibotentan, 24.4%), radiotherapy (22.0%; 21.4%), hormonal therapy (85.8%; 87.6%),
and immunotherapy (1.0%; 0.3%), with no apparent
effect on the overall outcome of this study. It is not possible to determine the effects of exposure, nature and timing
of chemotherapy between the 2 studies, but emphasizes
the challenge in designing clinical trials with primary OS
endpoints in CRPC. This is particularly true now that
there are 6 agents (docetaxel,12 sipuleucel-T,11 cabazitaxel,13 abiraterone,14 MDV3100,15 and radium-223
chloride16) approved and/or reporting improvements in
OS in CRPC.
Fourth, there were demographic differences between
the studies. The phase 3 trial included East Asian patients
(from China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South
Korea, and Taiwan) and the prespecified subgroup analysis of overall survival showed the treatment effect hazard
ratio was numerically worse in the overall Asian population compared with patients of other ethnic (predominantly Caucasian) backgrounds. However, this
observation should be interpreted with caution, given the
wide and overlapping confidence intervals, and the absence of data on the substratified Asian population. Interestingly, epidemiological studies have shown Asian
populations with prostate cancer, whether residing in Asia
or in the United States, to have better OS rates than Caucasian patient populations located in the same geographical region, which could indicate a genetic rather than
geographical basis for these differences.17,18 The influence
of genetic background on CRPC progression and
response to therapy remains an unquantifiable variable in
clinical trial design and holds the greatest promise for
understanding the disease. Collectively, these differences
highlight the need for new and class-specific endpoints,
more reflective of mechanisms of action, to better facilitate the design of clinical trials and inform treatment
decisions.19

Despite dramatic effects on cancer-bone interactions
in preclinical models,5 ETA receptor antagonists have had
disappointing results in patients with CRPC in the phase 3
setting. Every study of an ETA receptor antagonist in
CRPC has been consistent in demonstrating a modest but
nonsignificant effect favoring the agent. The selective ETA
receptor antagonist atrasentan, which also reported positive
results in a number of phase 2 studies,20-23 failed to significantly impact disease progression in phase 3 studies in
patients with either metastatic or nonmetastatic
CRPC.24,25 The atrasentan studies also demonstrated the
difficulty of conducting trials in this disease state. For
example, both trials were underpowered to demonstrate a
difference. Asymptomatic radiographic progression in metastatic CRPC was unexpectedly rapid and median progression was reached at the first 3-month assessment.24 In
nonmetastatic CRPC, progression to metastases is protracted, and premature discontinuation, particularly in the
United States, was unexpectedly high; this appeared to be
largely driven by anxiety about PSA-only progression.25
The failure of the metastatic atrasentan study informed the
recommendations developed by the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG2), where confirmatory
scans are recommended for new bone lesions.26
Zibotentan had an acceptable safety profile and no
new concerns were identified. The most commonly
reported AEs were peripheral edema and headache, which
are consistent with the vasodilator properties of ETA receptor antagonists. Congestive heart failure is a common
comorbidity in elderly patients with prostate cancer, present in approximately 10% of patients 12 months before
diagnosis of prostate cancer.27 Cardiac failure events,
actively solicited due to a signal in the phase 2 study,9
although more commonly reported in zibotentan-treated
patients, were manageable and nonfatal, with patients
making full recoveries in most cases. The incidence of cardiac failure in the current study was similar to that
observed in both the earlier phase 2 study of zibotentan
and the atrasentan phase 3 study in a similar patient
population.9,24
Several emerging treatment approaches, including
novel targeted agents, hormonal therapies, bone-targeted
agents, and immune modulators, are currently in
advanced development or have received regulatory approval for patients with metastatic CRPC.28 The autologous vaccine sipuleucel-T has been approved to treat
asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic
CRPC.11 The CYP17 inhibitor abiraterone acetate14 and
the tubulin-binding taxane cabazitaxel13 have been
approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic

CRPC in the postdocetaxel setting. Denosumab, a RANK
ligand inhibitor, has been approved for the prevention of
skeletal-related events in metastatic CRPC.29 Radium223 chloride and MDV3100 have not yet received regulatory approval, but the ALSYMPCA (radium 223)16 and
AFFIRM (MDV3100)15 phase 3 trials in the advanced
disease setting were stopped early based on the results of
preplanned interim analyses, demonstrating significant
survival benefit over the comparator arm in each case.
Numerous other phase 3 studies are ongoing with a variety of treatment modalities, including MDV3100 and
abiraterone in chemotherapy-naive patients and orteronel
(endocrine therapies), aflibercept and tasquinimod (antiangiogenic), dasatinib (Src inhibitor), ipilimumab
(CTLA-4 inhibitor), and OGX-011 (clusterin inhibitor).28,30-35 The development of all these new agents is the
result of an increased understanding of molecular mechanisms associated with disease progression. To ensure the
success of future phase 3 trials in CRPC, efforts should be
made to optimize individual assessment of predictive biomarkers of drug efficacy and to better select patients most
likely to benefit from treatment.
In conclusion, zibotentan 10 mg/day plus standard
of care did not result in a significant improvement in OS
in patients with CRPC and bone metastases who were
pain-free or mildly symptomatic for pain and had not
received chemotherapy for metastatic disease. More
recently, the 2 additional phase 3 studies in the zibotentan
ENTHUSE program have also ended. The study investigating zibotentan as a monotherapy in patients with nonmetastatic CRPC (NCT00626548) was stopped
following an interim efficacy review by the IDMC, and
the study of zibotentan in combination with docetaxel in
patients with metastatic CRPC (NCT00617669) failed to
reach its primary endpoint of OS. As a result, zibotentan
is no longer being investigated as a potential treatment for
patients with prostate cancer.
