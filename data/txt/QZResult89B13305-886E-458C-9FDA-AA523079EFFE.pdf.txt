ABSTRACT:

A major challenge in advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is prediction
of chemoresistant relapse. Our aim was to identify a microRNA (miRNA) signature
associated with early relapse in advanced-stage EOC patients. miRNA expression
was assessed by microarray profiling in training (n = 55) and test (n = 30) sets
selected on the basis of time to relapse (TTR), followed by internal quantitative
reverse transcriptase-PCR validation on a set of 45 consecutive cases unselected
for clinical response and external in silico validation on publicly available datasets.
Thirty-two differentially expressed miRNAs in early vs. late relapsing patients
were identified in the training set. In the test set, 8 of these, belonging to a cluster
located on chrXq27.3, were down-modulated in early relapsing patients. Hierarchical
clustering of the internal validation set according to chrXq27.3 miRNA expression
associated low miRNA expression with shorter TTR (log-rank P=0.00074, HR 2.44).
The cluster was an independent prognostic factor in both internal and external
validation sets. Forced expression of chrXq27.3-cluster selected miRNAs in human
EOC cellular models was associated to reduction of cell proliferation and increased
sensitivity to cisplatin. The role of down-modulation of the chrXq27.3 miRNA
cluster in early relapse of advanced-stage EOC patients and its association to a
reduced sensitivity to chemotherapeutic treatments warrant further investigation.

INTRODUCTION

is approximately 30% [1]. Standard treatment for
advanced‑stage EOC is aggressive surgery followed
by platinum‑taxane chemotherapy, with response
rates of over 80% [3]. However, most of these patients
will eventually relapse, with a median time to relapse
(TTR) of 18 months. Several drugs are available to treat
relapsing patients, although clinical responses remain
short‑lived and lead to only marginal improvements in
survival of patients with platinum‑resistant disease [4].
Therefore, there is a critical need for early identification

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains one of
the most challenging areas of cancer research. Despite
ongoing efforts to develop an effective screening
strategy [1] and years of research into new treatments,
the survival rate from EOC remains one of the lowest of
all cancers [2]. The poor ratio of survival to incidence in
EOC is a result of the high percentage of cases presenting
at an advanced‑stage; the overall 5‑year survival rate

of patients with drug‑resistant cancers so that alternative
therapeutic modalities can be offered.
Normal human cells express thousands of
non‑coding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs),
whose regulatory activity and alterations in expression
contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of several
human malignancies [5‑7]. As recently reviewed [8],
a general down‑modulation of miRNA expression is
observed in EOC compared to normal tissue, and the
most frequently deregulated miRNAs are members of the
let‑7 and miR‑200 families; the latter is involved in the
epithelial mesenchymal transition and has been found to
be de‑regulated in both early‑ and advanced‑stage EOC
[9, 10]. Nonetheless, clear consensus miRNA signatures
associated with EOC prognosis or prediction of response
to conventional therapy have not yet described [8].
Recently, the results of an integrated genomic
analyses of a large cohort of advanced‑stage, high‑grade
serous ovarian cancer has become publicly available [11];
in this Cancer Genome Atlas study, clustering of miRNA
expression data identified three subtypes of tumors but
no data of association with early relapse are at present
available.
With the objective of identifying a miRNA signature

of EOC early relapse, a training set of samples from
advanced‑stage EOC patients, selected for different
residual disease and TTR, and profiled by miRNA
microarray analysis, has been characterized by a miRNA
signature comprising a miRNA cluster located on
Chromosome X and down modulated in early relapsing
patients. A test set with similar clinical characteristics
challenged with the identified miRNA signature confirmed
that low expression levels of chrXq27.3 miRNAs
cluster associated with an early relapse. Validation
by quantitative reverse transcriptase‑PCR (qRT‑PCR)
showed that expression of the chrXq27.3 miRNA
cluster correlated with clinical outcome in a cohort of
consecutively collected samples. The association of low
expression of chrXq27.3 miRNA cluster with a shorter
TTR was confirmed by in silico analysis of publicly
available datasets of advanced stage EOC patients with
known clinical history. Finally, the functional role of three
miRNAs was investigated using two human EOC cell
lines, in which reduced cell proliferation and increased
sensitivity to cisplatin (DDP) treatment was demonstrated
after forced miRNAs expression.

and imposing a FDR<10%, no significant modulation of
miRNA was detected between stage III and IV lesions,

undifferentiated tumors, or optimally debulked (OD)

A test set (13 and 17 patients with early and late
relapse, respectively), selected in agreement with
debulking status and TTR criteria adopted for the training
set, was used to validate the microarray data obtained
with the training set. As listed in Table 1, there were no
differences in age, stage, grade, histology, or debulking
status of patients between the training and test sets,
and only the median follow‑up period was longer in
the latter (49 versus 64 months, respectively). Profiling
of the test set detected 741 miRNAs, including 28/32

on the miRNA signature identified in the training set,
correctly classified test set patients according to relapse in
90% of cases (27/30) (Figure 1B). Ten of these miRNAs
showed significant differential expression (P <0.01),
and all but one were down‑regulated in patients with
early relapse (Table 2). Among these, eight were located
in chrXq27.3, representing a highly correlated and
co‑expressed miRNA cluster. The fold change of the 10
differentially expressed miRNAs between patients with
early and late relapse was highly correlated (R2= 0.838)
in the two clinical sets (Figure 1C).
Thirty‑nine samples belonging to training set and 24

to chrXq27.3 was detected. Unsupervised analysis
on the miRNome profile provided evidence that the
miRNAs located on chrXq27.3 are members of a highly
correlated and co‑expressed miRNA cluster. In particular

Over‑expression of cluster chrXq27.3 miRNAs in
EOC cell lines: effects on survival and platinum
sensitivity

six out of eight chrXq27.3 miRNAs (miR‑506, miR‑507,
miR‑508‑3p, miR‑509‑3p, miR‑509‑5p and miR‑514)
showed Pearson’s correlation greater than 0.95 (Figure
4A). Principal component analysis was applied on the
expression of the 8 chrXq27.3 miRNAs and the first
component (PC1) covering 74% of total variation in
the data was used for survival analysis. Based on PC1,
patients were split in quartiles and we considered two
groups with low and high expression intensities of
chrXq27.3 miRNA cluster corresponding to the first
(n=90) and the fourth (n=90) quartile, respectively.
The two groups represent patients with well‑defined
expression pattern as highlighted by MDS analysis
(Figure 4B). Kaplan‑Meier analysis confirmed that
patients with low expression of chrXq27.3 miRNA cluster
experienced shorter progression free survival (log‑rank,
P=0.0092; HR= 1.57, 95%CI: 1.12‑2.22). The median
TTP was 14 and 19 months for patients with low and high
chrXq27.3 miRNA expression, respectively (Figure 4C).
Using miRNA cluster expression and surgical debulking
as covariates, a bivariable Cox regression analysis
indicated down‑regulation of chrXq27.3 miRNAs as a
possible independent prognostic indicator of early relapse
(HR = 1.85; 95% CI: 1.28‑2.66, P = 0.001).

The association of chrXq27.3 miRNA cluster
lower expression with shorter TTR, suggested a possible
involvement of these miRNAs in cell growth and
response to therapy.
Three miRNAs belonging to the chrXq27.3 cluster,
miR‑513b, miR‑506 and miR‑513a‑5p, were selected
according to their different fold change expression
observed by microarray and class comparison analysis
on EOC samples (see Table 2) and their expression
was forced by transient transfection in two EOC cell
lines, SKOV3 and OAW42. The miRNAs increased
expression level upon transfection and its specificity
was demonstrated by qRT‑PCR (supplementary Figure
1). Forced expression of miR‑506 induced a significant
reduction of cell proliferation in both cell lines (39±3%
and 57±7%, relative to control cells transfected with the
scrambled miRNA, in SKOV3 and OAW42 respectively),
whereas miR-513a-5p and miR‑513b showed a less
intense, albeit significant anti proliferative effect (37±5%
and 17±6% of reduction respectively) on OAW42 cells
only (Figure 5A).
A relevant increase of cells blocked in the G1 phase
in both cell lines (increase range 16% ‑ 30% compare to
control in three independent experiments) was observed
upon forced expression of miR‑506, while increase of

cell death, evaluated as cellular debris, was observed in
OAW42 cells only (Figure 5B). Forced expression of
the other two miRNAs in SKOV3 cells, mirroring the
marginal effects on cell proliferation, did not substantially
affect cell cycle dynamics. In miR‑513a‑5p‑transfected
OAW42 cells, accumulation of cells in the G1‑phase was
evident and was accompanied with a slight increase (8%)
of cells blocked in the G2‑M phase. In agreement with the
weaker anti‑proliferative effect obtained on OAW42 cells
after miR‑513b‑transfection, only a marginal increase
(5%) of G1‑phase and a 10% increase of cells blocked in
G2‑M phase was observed as compared to the other two
miRNAs (Figure 5B).
Based on these data, OAW42 cell line was
selected to assess the effect of the forced expression
of the three miRNAs on response to DDP treatment. A
growth inhibition of 58±8% (Figure 6A) was observed
in scrambled miR‑transfected (control) cells exposed
to a DDP concentration that, according to our previous
knowledge, corresponds to IC50 in parental cells. DDP
sensitivity at concentration ranging from 10x10‑6 to
0.03x10‑6 M was significantly increased (P=0.001) as
assessed by sulphorodamine‑B (SRB) assay following
forced expression of miR‑506 (Figure 6B). Also
miR‑513a‑5p and miR‑513b caused a significantly
increased DDP sensitivity. At a DDP concentration
corresponding to the IC50 in scramble‑transfected cells,
cell growth was further inhibited following 54±5%
following miR‑513a‑5p and 66±14% by miR-513b

transfection (Figure 6C).
In miRNA‑transfected‑DDP‑treated cells, the effects
on cell cycle resulted more variable and less informative.
As a general observation, all the three miRNAs induced,
although at different extent, an accumulation of cells in
G1‑phase (figure 6D). Forced expression of miR‑513b
caused a higher accumulation of cells in G2‑M phase
as compared to miR‑506 and miR‑513a‑5p whereas
forced expression of miR513a induced a more consistent
increase of cell debris as compared to the other two
miRNAs.

DISCUSSION
Therapeutic decisions in EOC after first‑line
chemotherapy should be based on the risk of tumor
relapse. Although for solid tumors such as breast and
prostate cancer, molecular profiling of primary tumors
can help in defining risk of relapse, prediction of drug
response, and time to relapse [12, 13], the heterogeneous
clinical and pathological characteristics of advanced‑stage
EOC patients make it difficult to exploit genome‑wide
information to stratify patients according to prognosis
[14]. However, there is accumulating evidence that
miRNAs may be of higher utility than mRNA expression
due to their master regulatory role, and examples of
their utility as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets
have been reported for other solid tumors [15]. To our
knowledge, this is the first study to date specifically

designed to identify miRNAs as markers of early
relapse in advanced‑stage EOC. Using 2 independent
cohorts and microarray analysis we identified a cluster
of miRNAs, located at chrXq27.3 in a region <0.5 Mb,
that are always down‑modulated or almost switched‑off
in patients that experience early relapse. Validation of
this result by qRT‑PCR in a set of consecutively collected
cases highlighted a significant correlation between low
expression of chrXq27.3 miRNAs and clinical outcome.
Our
cohorts
of
patients,
which
were
well‑characterized for clinical and pathological
characteristics, came from a single institution; therefore,
efforts were focused in reducing the potential over‑fitting
of data [16]. Training and test sets, selected with the same
criteria and analyzed on the same miRNA microarray,
were independently obtained from institutional tissue
bank and archival pathologic repository, respectively. Due
to the fact that the quality of RNA extracted from FFPE
tissues (test set) was not as high as that of RNA extracted
from frozen tissues (training set), the number of samples
in the test set was quite limited; however, both sets were
equally reliable when used for qRT‑PCR measurements.
For validation of chrXq27.3 miRNA cluster, we used
a third cohort of consecutive frozen samples from
advanced‑stage EOC and qRT‑PCR as detection assay.
Our criteria for case selection only partially
overlap those adopted in the Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) project for EOC which considered only
clinically annotated stage II‑IV high‑grade serous ovary
cancers [11]. In our analysis, the selection was driven
by different TTR in stage III‑IV cases without prior
selection by grade and histotype. However, taking into
account the significant progress in the histopathological
sub‑classification of EOC [17], the majority of our cases
could be classified as so‑called type II tumors (grade
2‑3; subtype: serous, undifferentiated and endometrioid),
characterized by very aggressive behavior [18]. Indeed,
only 1/130 cases was grade 1, 5/130 were clear cells and
1/130 was mucinous. In the case of the validation set,
unselected for response to therapy, bivariate analysis
with miRNA cluster expression and surgical debulking
as covariates identified the chrXq27.3 miRNA cluster as
a potential independent predictor of early relapse in type
II EOC tumors (40/45 cases). This result was in silico
validated on the TGCA miRNA profile [11] although
the two platforms used for the analysis were different
and a clear standardization in platform fabrication, assay
protocol, and analysis methods is still lacking.
The finding that a lower expression of the miRNA
cluster chrXq27.3 is consistently associated with shorter
TTR also when the signature was challenged on a wider
and independent publicly available dataset suggested a
possible involvement of these miRNAs in cell growth
and response to therapy. Members of this cluster have
been previously identified as down‑modulated in
advanced‑stage and/or high grade lesions [19], and one
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

miRNA belonging to the cluster (miR‑509) was found to
be down‑modulated in chemoresistant advanced‑stage
EOC [20], supporting the relevance of our results.
Our in vitro data essentially support the proposed
antiproliferative role for these miRNA although a quite
heterogeneous effect in terms of efficacy and efficiency
has been observed when considered individually. In
particular a role for miR‑506 in favoring blockade of cell
cycle in G1 phase and inducing cell death is suggested
by our data. The role of miR‑506 in tumor cells has not
yet clearly defined and probably, as already described
for other miRNAs, its effect could be cell and tumor
type dependent. Indeed recent literature, in accordance
with our observations, suggests a putative role as an
anti‑oncogenic miRNA in human bronchial epithelial
cells where miR‑506 expression regulates cell growth and
proliferation [21] but also its over expression has been
recently related to hydroxycamptothecin resistance in a
colon cancer cell line by direct inhibiting expression of
Peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptors (PPARs) [22].
The other two miRNAs (miR‑513a‑5p and miR‑513b)
were selected among the other miRNAs belonging to
the cluster on the basis of their differential fold change
expression. However, their forced expression only
partially reflects the effects observed with miR‑506. Of
note, two different analysis both performed on available
unselected EOC samples (validation set and TCGA data)
indicate that miR‑513a‑5p and miR‑513b form a separate
subcluster within the Xq.27.3 cluster. Taken together,
expression and biological data suggest that within
the identified cluster, the individual miRNAs could
contribute to the overall cell behavior with only partially
common mechanisms of regulation. The identification
and validation of target genes of each individual members
of the cluster could clarify this aspect and thus deserve
further and specific investigation.
Eight out of 10 miRNAs, whose expression is
down‑regulated in patients with adverse outcome,
localized in a less than 0.5Mb cluster on chrX. A variety
of mechanisms including amplification, deletion or
mutation may contribute to the deregulation of miRNA
expression (reviewed in [23]). The primary regulatory
mechanism of miRNA expression however, seems to be
a transcriptional control essentially exerted by epigenetic
silencing (reviewed in [24]). The availability of TGCA
data prompted us to analyze in silico the methylation
pattern of ChrX. Despite the continuous update of the
platforms and the increase in the specific probes, still
the coverage of our region of interest, i.e Xq27.3, is
limited. However, we observed that the region Xq27‑
Xq28 was among the most frequently ipermethylated
(Supplementary Figure 2). Although further analysis is
needed, it seems likely that methylation play some role in
the observed downregulation of miRNA cluster.
Due to the stringent criteria adopted for selection
of training and test sets, we cannot exclude that, in
1274

Oncotarget 2011; 2: 1265 - 1278

addition to the validated miRNA cluster, other miRNAs
are involved in drug response. Further studies using
completely independent cohorts of patients from other
institutions are clearly needed. In this context, the miRNA
profiling of samples from a randomized clinical trial [25]
is currently under investigation.
Taken together, the present data open the possibility
of a new mechanistic hypothesis of gene regulation
exerted by the chrXq27.3 miRNA cluster in EOC. The
identified miRNA cluster, hopefully associated with other
newly discovered miRNAs, may be applied in the context
of clinical trials, as a potential marker of drug response in
advanced‑stage EOC patients.

Samples from training and validation sets were collected
at the time of primary surgery and immediately frozen,
samples from the test set were FFPE. Tumor content of
all specimens was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin
staining and all samples selected for miRNA analysis had
>70% tumor cellularity and <20% necrosis. Patients from
training (55 samples) and test (30 samples) sets were
selected on the basis of residual disease after primary
surgery [26]. To explore miRNA expression association
with chemotherapy response, patients were also selected
according to TTR as: patients with early relapse when
the TTR was shorter than 12 (OD) or 6 (sub‑OD)
months; patients with late relapse when TTR was equal
or longer than 36 (OD) or 12 (sub‑OD) months. Patients
in the validation set (45 samples) were selected from a
consecutive case material on the basis of availability of
both biological samples and clinical data without clinical
restriction, but at an advanced‑stage; patients reflected the
age at diagnosis, stage, tumor grade, and surgical outcome
of individuals typically diagnosed with advanced‑stage
EOC with a median TTR of 16 months [27]. Table 1
summarizes the clinical and pathologic characteristics of
patients. Taking into account the new EOC classification
[28], our case materials were mainly composed by Type
II tumoros, indeed Type I tumors represented less than
10% in each set, being: 3 cases (1 low‑grade serous
and 2 clear cell tumors) present in training set; one low
grade endometrioid tumor present in test set; and 4 cases
(3 clear cell and 1 mucinous) in validation set. All these
tumors were at stage III.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and biological materials
A total of 130 patients with advanced‑stage
EOC were included in the study. All these patients
underwent primary surgery at the Fondazione IRCCS
Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori (INT) and had biological
material available for molecular analysis, as well as
complete clinical data and follow‑up information. The
Institutional Review Board approved the use of surgical
specimens (immediately snap‑frozen after surgery and
stored at ‑80°C), formalin‑fixed paraffin‑embedded
(FFPE) tissue blocks, and clinical data. The study was
performed on tumor samples collected at surgery before
chemotherapeutic treatment from three independent
patient cohorts (training, test and validation sets)
undergoing primary surgery between 1990 and 2008 and
matched for time of diagnosis. All patients underwent
exploratory laparotomy for diagnosis, staging, and
debulking, and based on the extent of residual disease,
patients were divided into three groups: no evident
disease (NED); minimal residual disease (mRD,
residual tumor <1 cm) and gross residual disease (GRD,
residual tumor ≥1 cm). Patients NED or with mRD were
considered optimally debulked (OD). Tumor staging
was in accordance with the criteria of the International
Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO).
After surgery, patients received treatment with standard
platinum‑based therapeutic schedules (platinum without
taxanes; platinum and paclitaxel) according to the time of
accrual. Time to relapse (TTR) was the time in months
from completion of chemotherapy until first evidence
(clinical, instrumental or biological) of disease recurrence
(if a complete response was achieved) or progression.
Standard post‑chemotherapy surveillance included
routine physical examinations, serum CA‑125 levels, and
computed tomography scanning as clinically indicated.
Follow‑up time was the interval between diagnosis and
date of death or the last information in medical records.

miRNA analysis
RNA extraction from frozen or FFPE tissues,
quality assessment, miRNA hybridization conditions,
preprocessing, and miRNA data analysis were performed
as detailed in the Supplementary material. Mature
miRNAs were amplified [29] and labeled probes were
hybridized on Illumina miRNA BeadChips Array.
The microarray dataset and clinical information were
deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database
(experiment number GSE25204) according to MIAME
(minimum information about a microarray experiment)
guidelines. TaqMan microRNA assays from Applied
Biosystems and Exiqon were used to quantify mature
miRNAs. qRT‑PCR validation and Taqman Assays are
described in the Supplementary material.

EOC cell lines and miRNA transfection
The OAW42 cell line (serous histotype, kindly
provided by Dr. A. Ullrich, Max‑Planck Institute,
Germany, and verified in house for identity by
microsatellite analysis) was maintained in MEM
supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mmol/L
1275

Oncotarget 2011; 2: 1265 - 1278

Bioinformatic analyses

L‑glutamine (Sigma) and 1% non‑essential amino
acids (100X stock; Euroclone, Italy) in a humidified
chamber (5% CO2, 37°C). The SKOV3 cell line, (serous
histotype, from ATCC and verified in house for identity
by microsatellite analysis) was maintained in RPMI
1640 (Sigma Aldrich) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS)
(Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 2 mmol/L glutamine in a
5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37°C. Cells were
confirmed to be mycoplasma‑free. Ectopic expression of
miR‑506, miR‑513a‑5p and miR‑513b was pursued by
exposing EOC cell lines to 20 nM miRNA precursors,
purchased as a pre‑miR molecule (Ambion, Austin,TX).
Scrambled Pre‑miR molecules (Pre‑miR Negative
Controls; Ambion) were used as a control. Transfection
was carried out using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen),
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The effect of
ectopically expressed miRNAs was evaluated at day 3
after 4‑h of transfection by assessing miRNAs levels by
qRT‑PCR.

Two publicly‑available datasets reporting miRNA
expression and clinical annotated data were identified at
the best of our knowledge and downloaded from the web:
GSE27290 (available on GEO repository, [31]) and the
Cancer Genomics Atlas (TGCA, [11]) study available at
http://tcga‑data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/ov_2011/.
The former data set consists of 62 diagnosed patients
with stage III or IV serous ovarian cancer, while the latter
reports the profiling of 489 high‑grade serous EOCs.
Although both studies were generated using the Agilent
platform, GSE27290 was profiled on a pre‑commercial
version of miRNA chips (GPL7341) designed on
miRBase 9.1. Due to the incomplete presence of miRNAs
belonging to the chrXq27.3 cluster of our interest and the
differences in miRBase annotation between GPL7341
and our Illumina platform, GSE27290 was not considered
for further analyses. TGCA profiling was performed
on 8x15Kv2 chip designed on miRBase10.1. Time to
progression (defined as the interval from the date of
initial surgical resection to the date of progression, date
of recurrence, or date of last known contact if the patient
was alive and has not recurred) was used as the primary
end point.

Proliferation assay and drug treatment
The day after miRNAs transfection, OAW42 cells
were exposed for 7h to cis‑platinum (DDP) (TEVA Italia
s.r.l) at serial dilution starting from 10x10‑6 to 0.03x10‑6
M for Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay and at 1x10‑6 M,
corresponding to inhibiting concentration 50 (IC50)
according to our previous experience [30], for other drug
treatment assays. The effects of miRNA transfection and
DDP treatment on cell proliferation were assessed 72h
after transfection by Trypan Blue exclusion assay or by
SRB assay. For SRB assay cells were seeded in 96‑well
flat‑bottom plates at an initial concentration of 5,000
cells per well in complete medium. Without removing the
cell culture supernatant, cells were fixed by incubation
for 1 h at 4°C with trichloroacetic acid (TCA) at the
final concentration 10% (w/vol). Following extensive
washing in water, cells were stained for 30 min with
0.4% (w/v) SRB dissolved in 1% acetic acid. Wells were
rinsed with 1% acetic acid and air dried. Bound dye was
solubilized with 10 mM Tris base (pH 10.5) in a shaker.
The OD was measured at 550 nm in a microplate reader
(BIORAD,model 550).

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Class
comparison,
hierarchical
clustering,
muldimensional scaling (MDS), global test of clustering,
and heat map analyses were performed using BrB
ArrayTools_v4.1.0‑stable release (Simon, R. and Lam,
AP;
http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB‑ArrayTools.html).
Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using
the open‑source PCA module of MeV (MultiExperiment
Viewer, v4.6; http://mev.tm4.org), developed at The
Institute for Genomic Research. The clinical and
pathological characteristics of the three sets of patients
were compared by Fisher’s exact test. Levels of miRNA
and gene expression were compared by a Student’s t test.
The linear relationship between variables was estimated
by Pearson’s coefficient of correlation (r) and R2
coefficient of determination. We assessed the association
of miRNA expression with TTR.
TTR curves were generated by the Kaplan Meyer
method and differences between curves were compared
using a non‑parametric (log‑rank) test and hazard ratios
and 95% confidence intervals were also computed. A
bivariable Cox regression model was used to evaluate
the prognostic impact of miRNAs expression taking
into account the effect of surgical debulking. A two level
classification was used for both miRNAs expression and
surgical debulking. P values of all statistical tests were
two sided. GraphPadPrism v5 (GraphPad software, La
