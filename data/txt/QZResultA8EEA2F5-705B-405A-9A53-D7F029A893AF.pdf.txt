ABSTRACT
The effectiveness of Hsp90 inhibitors as anticancer agents was limited in
multidrug-resistant (MDR) human cancer cells due to induction of heat shock
proteins (Hsps) such as Hsp70/Hsp27 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated efflux.
In the present study, we showed that resistance to Hsp90 inhibitors of MDR human
cancer cells could be overcome with SIRT1 inhibition. SIRT1 knock-down or SIRT1
inhibitors (amurensin G and EX527) effectively suppressed the resistance to Hsp90
inhibitors (17-AAG and AUY922) in several MDR variants of human lymphoblastic
leukemia and human breast cancer cell lines. SIRT1 inhibition down-regulated the
expression of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and subsequently Hsps and facilitated Hsp90
multichaperone complex disruption via hyperacetylation of Hsp90/Hsp70. These
findings were followed by acceleration of ubiquitin ligase CHIP-mediated mutant
p53 (mut p53) degradation and subsequent down-regulation of P-gp in 17-AAGtreated MDR cancer cells expressing P-gp and mut p53 after inhibition of SIRT1.
Therefore, combined treatment with Hsp90 inhibitor and SIRT1 inhibitor could be a
more effective therapeutic approach for Hsp90 inhibitor-resistant MDR cells via downregulation of HSF1/Hsps, mut p53 and P-gp.

activation of the heat shock factor (HSF1), which causes
transcriptional induction of Hsp70/Hsp27 that protect
cancer cells from apoptosis and induce drug resistance
[6, 7], offsetting their own anticancer activities. Although
17-AAG and AUY922 inhibit the function of Hsp90, they
usually increase the heat shock proteins (Hsps) such as
Hsp70/Hsp27, which reduce the Hsp90-targeted drug
efficacy by inhibiting apoptosis signaling [8–10]. Indeed,
resistance to 17-AAG is linked to the induction of Hsp70/
Hsp27 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated efflux [11–15].
The 17-AAG sensitivity was significantly increased by
transfection of Hsp27 and/or Hsp70 siRNA in 17-AAGresistant cells [14]. HSF1 also appears to regulate multiple
pathways involved in expression of multidrug-resistant

INTRODUCTION
Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular
chaperone whose association is required for the stability
and function of numerous oncoproteins that promote the
growth and/or survival of cancer cells, and therefore may
serve as a therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer
[1]. Several Hsp90 inhibitors such as 17-allylamino17-demethoxy-geldanamycin (17-AAG), an ansamycin
Hsp90 inhibitor, and NVP-AUY922 (hereafter called
AUY922), a non-ansamycin Hsp90 inhibitor, have shown
potent antitumor activity in a wide-range of malignancies
[2–5]. However, it is known that treatment with Hsp90
inhibitors leads, through a negative feedback loop, to

(MDR) phenotype in addition to induction of Hsps that
leads to escape from chemotherapy-mediated cell killing.
MDR1 gene that encodes P-gp is known to contain heat
shock elements in the promoter region, and HSF1 can
activate MDR1 expression in a stress-independent manner
[16]. Therefore, silencing HSF1/Hsps could cause an
increased sensitivity of MDR cells to Hsp90 inhibitor
possibly by down-regulation of P-gp. HSF1 can also
control the stability of mut p53 protein in human cancer
cells. It has been known that naturally unfolded mutant
p53 (mut p53) is an Hsp90 client protein and forms
stable complex with Hsp90 multichaperone machinery
[17]. Knockdown of HSF1 in mut p53 (+) cancer cells,
which leads to down-regulation of Hsps, induces rapid
destabilization of mut p53 [18]. As an oncoprotein,
mut p53, a hallmark of almost 50% of human tumors,
up-regulates the expression of MDR1 gene and may
confer upon tumor cells a selective survival advantage
during chemotherapy [19]. Therefore, it is necessary to
develop new therapeutics that can induce mut p53 protein
degradation. It has been demonstrated that in the absence
of Hsp90 activity, the less stable unfolded mut p53 protein
preferentially associate in a complex with Hsp70 and
CHIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein)
ubiquitin ligase [17], which has a major role for in the
degradation of unfolded mut p53, with little or no roles
for CHIP in degrading wild-type p53 protein [20]. This
CHIP-mediated degradation of mut p53 would suppress
the expression of MDR1/P-gp in MDR cells.
Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a class III histone deacetylase
(HDAC), is required for the activation and stability of
HSF1, which in turn is responsible for Hsp70 induction
[21]. Down-regulation of SIRT1 resulted in a release of
the acetylated HSF1 from its cognate promoter elements
[22]. However, it is not known whether SIRT1 inhibition
may modulate the effect of Hsp90 inhibitors, which offset
their own effect on anticancer activity through suppression
of HSF1/Hsps and degradation of mut p53.
In the present study, we demonstrated that SIRT1
inhibitor sensitized MDR cells to Hsp90 inhibitors
via down-regulation of HSF1/Hsps, mut p53 and P-gp
consequently overcoming resistance of MDR cells to
Hsp90 inhibitors.

or another structurally unrelated AUY922, and then
the cytotoxicity was determined by MTT assay. CEM/
VLB55–8 and CEM/VLB100, MDR variants of CEM cells,
expressing moderate and high levels of P-gp, respectively,
exhibited a marked resistance to 17-AAG compared with
their parental CEM cells. Similar results were observed
in between MCF7-MDR, a MDR variant of MCF-7,
with high level of P-gp and their parental MCF-7 cells
(Figure 1A and 1B). In addition, HeyA8-MDR, a MDR
variant of HeyA8, and CEM/VLB100 cells were highly
resistant to AUY922 when compared to their parental
counterparts (Figure 1C). MCF7-MDR cells also were
highly resistant to AUY922 (data not shown). These results
suggest that P-gp expression might contribute to resistance
of MDR cells to Hsp90 inhibitors. To determine whether
the resistance to Hsp90 inhibitors is dependent on the
P-gp in MDR cells, MCF7-MDR and CEM/VLB100 cells
were treated with 17-AAG in the presence of verapamil, a
pharmacologic inhibitor of P-gp. The susceptibility of both
MDR cells to 17-AAG was increased by treatment with
verapamil dose-dependently (Figure 2A). Similar results
were obtained in AUY922-treated MDR cells. Verapamil
potentiated the cytotoxicity of AUY922 on MCF7-MDR
and CEM/VLB100 cells (Figure 2B). Therefore, it could be
suggested that P-gp expression might contribute at least
in part to the resistance of MDR cells to Hsp90 inhibitors.

Involvement of 17-AAG-mediated activation of
HSF1 in resistance of MDR cells to 17-AAG
It has been shown that inhibition of Hsp90 function
shifts the chaperone association of client proteins such
as mut p53 from Hsp90 to Hsp70, resulting in their
proteasomal degradation [23], and dissociates the
Hsp90-HSF1 complex, causing the activation of HSF1
and consequently HSF1-mediated induction of Hsps
[6]. To demonstrate the involvement of HSF1-mediated
induction of Hsps in resistance of MDR cells to Hsp90
inhibitor, activation of HSF1 and the levels of Hsps
were determined after treatment of MCF-7 MDR cells
with 17-AAG. The activation of HSF1 evidenced by
an electrophoretic mobility shift and levels of Hsp70/
Hsp27 were increased by treatment with 17-AAG, dosedependently. These results were accompanied with the
dissociation of mut p53 and Hsp90, and subsequent
association of mut p53 with Hsp70 and ubiquitin ligase
CHIP, which resulted in a decrease in mut p53 level
(Figure 3A), indicating the HSF1-mediated induction
of Hsps and decrease of mut p53 possibly through
formation of complex with Hsp70 and CHIP after
treatment with Hsp90 inhibitor. Interestingly, this reverse
correlation between the levels of mut p53 and CHIP
was demonstrated in various MDR variants, including
MCF7-MDR, CEM/VLB55–8 and CEM/VLB100, in which
expression of mut p53 protein was increased, and the

with the level of mut p53 when compared with their

After knockdown of HSF1 with siRNA in MCF7-MDR

significantly increased in both MDR cells (Figure 3C).
These results suggest that inhibition of HSF1 activity as
well as P-gp may be useful to suppress the resistance of
MDR cells to HSP90 inhibitors.

Since it has been shown that up-regulation
of SIRT1 is correlated with P-gp-mediated MDR

accelerated the attenuation of the heat shock response
by inactivation of HSF1 through increased acetylation
[21], we first examined the level of SIRT1 in MDR
cells. Up-regulation of SIRT1 was observed in MCF7MDR, CEM/VLB100 and HeyA8-MDR cells compared

determined whether inhibition of SIRT1 could suppress
HSF1-dependent pathways in MDR cells (Figure 4B).
When SIRT1 was knock-downed in MCF7-MDR cells
with increasing amounts of SIRT1 siRNA, the levels of
HSF1 and Hsps were down-regulated in the MDR cells.
In addition, the acetylation of Hsp90 and Hsp70, which

by knockdown of SIRT1. This result was followed by
hyperacetylation and decrease of mut p53 and increase
of CHIP. Similar results were observed in MCF7MDR cells treated with gradual doses of amurensin G,
a natural SIRT1 inhibitor (Figure 4C, upper panels).

western blot analysis was performed to monitor protein levels of HSF1, Hsps, CHIP and total and acetylated mut p53. For determination of
acetylated Hsp90 (Ac-Hsp90*) or Hsp70 (Ac-Hsp70*), cell lysates from (A) or (B) were immunoprecipitated with anti-pan-AcK antibody
and immunoblotted with anti-Hsp90 or Hsp70 antibody. In addition, cell lysates treated with AG were immunoprecipitated with anti-p23
antibody and immunoblotted with anti-Hsp90 or -SIRT1 antibody (B, lower panels). The level of IgG was used as a loading control.

Suppression of 17-AAG-mediated activation of
HSF1-dependent pathway and enhancement of
17-AAG-induced apoptosis by SIRT1 inhibition

HSF1 through hyperacetylation [21], and mut p53 can
activate HSF1 directly and indirectly [26], our results
suggest the possibility that depletion of SIRT1 lead
to inhibition of HSF1-dependent pathway through
hyperacetylation of Hsp90/Hsp70 and mut p53.
In addition, treatment of MCF-7/MDR cells with
amurensin G led to a decreased binding of cochaperone
p23 to Hsp90 and SIRT1 (Figure 4B, lower panels).
Since the p23 locks Hsp90 in a conformational state
with a high affinity for client proteins, promoting the
folding and stabilization of client proteins [27], our
results suggest that SIRT1 inhibition may promote
degradation of Hsp90 client protein such as mut p53
through the decreased formation of Hsp90/SIRT1/p23
complex.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Since it has been reported that HSF1-dependent
induction of Hsps occurs frequently in response to Hsp90
inhibitor, and it attenuates Hsp90 inhibitor-induced
cytotoxicity [11], and our data showed that depletion of
SIRT1 lead to inhibition of HSF1-dependent pathway, we
determined whether inhibition of SIRT1 could suppress
17-AAG-mediated activation of HSF1-dependent
pathway in MCF7-MDR and CEM/VBL100 cells. SIRT1
knockdown attenuated 17-AAG-mediated induction of
Hsp70/Hsp27, and reinforced down-regulation of mut
p53 and up-regulation of CHIP in both MDR cells. In
36207

addition, the level of P-gp was remarkably down-regulated
after knockdown of SIRT1 in the presence of 17-AAG
(Figure 5A and 5B). We further investigated the interaction
of mut p53 with Hsp90/Hsp70 and CHIP in 17-AAGtreated MCF7-MDR cells after knockdown of SIRT1 using
co-immunoprecipitation assay. The 17-AAG-mediated
dissociation of mut p53 and Hsp90, and association of
mut p53 with Hsp70 and CHIP were reinforced by SIRT1
knockdown (Figure 5A, lower panels) or by amurensin G
in MCF7-MDR cells (Figure 5C, upper panels). When the
reverse co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed with
an anti-Hsp90, binding of Hsp90 to mut p53 and SIRT1
was significantly reduced by co-treatment of MCF7MDR cells with 17-AAG and amurensin G than with
17-AAG alone (Figure 5C, lower panels). To determine
whether amurensin G down-regulated mut p53 at the
posttranslational level, the level of mut p53 protein in
the both MDR cells was determined in the presence of
cycloheximide (CHX), a protein synthesis inhibitor after
treatment with amurensin G (Figure 5D). We found that
mut p53 protein started to decrease at 4 h after treatment
with CHX alone but markedly decreased at 2 h after cotreatment of both MDR cells with CHX and amurensin G,
suggesting that SIRT1 inhibition reduced the half-life
of mut p53 possibly through degradation of the protein.
We observed consistent results with amurensin G in both
MDR cells, including MCF7-MDR and CEM/VBL100
cells, in comparison with siSIRT1 (Figure 6A and 6C).
In addition, treatment with amurensin G reinforced downregulation of Bcl-2, up-regulation of Bax, and activation of
caspase-3-mediated PARP cleavage in MCF7-MDR cells
in the presence of 17-AAG (Figure 6B). Similarly, EX527,
a SIRT1-specific inhibitor, suppressed 17-AAG-induced
Hsp70/Hsp27 expression and accelerated 17-AAGinduced down-regulation of mut p53 and P-gp and upregulation of CHIP in CEM/VBL100 cells (Figure 6D). We
therefore determined whether amurensin G can enhance
susceptibility of MDR cells to 17-AAG-induced apoptosis.
Co-treatment with amurensin G enhanced 17-AAGinduced apoptosis in both MCF7-MDR and CEM/VBL100
cells (Figure 7). Similarly, potentiation of 17-AAGinduced apoptosis by amurensin G was observed in
HeyA8-MDR cells (data not shown). These results suggest
that SIRT1 inhibition would be used to sensitize MDR
cells to 17-AAG-induced apoptosis through suppression
of activation of HSF1-dependent pathway and downregulation of P-gp expression.

cytometric functional efflux assay based on the extrusion
of rhodamine 123 (Rho 123), a fluorescent substrate for
P-gp. Amurensin G or EX527 significantly suppressed
efflux of Rho 123 and consequently increased the
intracellular level of fluorescence, and combined treatment
of amurensin G or EX527 with 17-AAG suppressed
further the efflux of Rho 123 in MCF7-MDR and CEM/
VBL100 cells, meanwhile 17-AAG, a substrate of P-gp, did
not show any effect on Rho 123 efflux at a concentration
used (Figure 8A). These results were consistent with
the decreased level of P-gp after combined treatment
of amurensin G with 17-AAG in both MDR cells. In
addition, we observed also very similar results with other
set of Hsp90 inhibitor, AUY922, and SIRT1 inhibitor,
EX527, in both MDR cells (Figure 8B). EX527 also
suppressed efflux of Rho 123 and consequently increased
the intracellular level of fluorescence, and combined
treatment of EX527 and AUY922 suppressed further the
efflux of Rho 123 in MCF7-MDR and CEM/VBL100 cells,
while AUY922 did not show any effect on Rho 123 efflux
at a concentration used, indicating that SIRT1 inhibition
could suppress the resistance of MDR cancer cells to
AUY922 as well as 17-AAG through suppression of
P-gp-mediated efflux. Therefore, these results suggest that
SIRT1 inhibitor is highly effective to increase an efficacy
of Hsp90 inhibitors through down-regulation of P-gp and
consequently to sensitize MDR cells to Hsp90 inhibitors.

Sensitization of MDR cells to 17-AAG by SIRT1
inhibition
Since SIRT1 inhibition suppressed activation of
HSF1-dependent pathway and P-gp-mediated efflux activity
sin 17-AAG-treated MDR cells, it was determined if SIRT1
inhibition could sensitize MDR cells to 17-AAG. When
MCF7-MDR and CEM/VLB100 cells were treated with 17AAG after SIRT1 knock-down, the sensitivity of the MDR
cells to 17-AAG was significantly enhanced (Figure 9A
and 9B). These results indicate that SIRT1 inhibition can
enhance the susceptibility of MDR cells to 17-AAG. To
examine further the potential relationship between SIRT1
activity and sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibitor in MDR cells, we
tested the combination effect of Hsp90 inhibitor with SIRT1
inhibitors in MCF7-MDR cells. SIRT1 inhibitors including
EX527 and amurensin G could increase the susceptibility of
MCF7-MDR cells to Hsp90 inhibitors including 17-AAG
and AUY922 (Figure 10A and 10B). The CI values were
lower than 0.5 at all concentrations, indicating a synergistic
effect of combination of both agents. The combination
effect of Hsp90 inhibitor and SIRT1 inhibitor was also
observed in MDR variants of CEM cells, including CEM/
VLB55–8 and CEM/VLB100 cells (Figure 11). When CEM/
VLB55–8 and CEM/VLB100 cells were co-treated with EX527
or amurensin G with 17-AAG, SIRT1 inhibitors enhanced
cytotoxicity of 17-AAG synergistically in both MDR

of P-gp by combined treatment with Hsp90 inhibitor
and SIRT1 inhibitor would lead to the reduction of

mediate an evasion of apoptosis [15]. Subsequently, it
is becoming increasingly evident that the combinatorial
targeting of Hsps could be a more effective therapeutic
approach. In addition, P-gp-mediated efflux of Hsp90

inhibition of SIRT1 enhanced susceptibility of various

HSF1 may play an important role in tumor initiation, development and maintenance, and activation
of HSF1 contributes to resistance to Hsp90 inhibitors
[15]. Inhibition of Hsp90 leads to disruption of regulatory complexes of Hsp90 with HSF1, thereby causing
HSF1-mediated induction of cytoprotective Hsp70/Hsp27.
Activation of HSF1 also induces expression of MDR1

gene and induces a MDR phenotype that allows escape
of cancer cells from chemotherapy-mediated cell killing [16]. It has been demonstrated that both activity and
level of HSF1 are positively regulated by SIRT1 [21, 28]
and mut p53 [26]. In our study, mut p53 level was decreased by SIRT1 inhibition. Therefore, we suggest that
SIRT1 inhibition down-regulate the activity and level of
HSF1 and subsequently Hsps, and facilitated Hsp90 multichaperone complex disruption via hyperacetylation of
Hsp90/Hsp70 as well. Actually, the sensitivity of 17-AAG

was significantly increased after knockdown of HSF1 in
Figure 3. Therefore, it is plausible that down-regulation
of SIRT1 would prevent 17-AAG-mediated induction of
HSF1, Hsp70 and P-gp, and consequently sensitize cancer
cells to 17-AAG. Our results showed that SIRT1 inhibition resulted in suppression of 17-AAG-mediated HSF1
activation and Hsp70/Hsp27 induction in MDR cells, and
this might be one of the mechanisms of the combination
effect of Hsp90 inhibitor and SIRT1 inhibitor. Hsp90 is
also responsible for the stability and function of mut p53
[17], which can up-regulate MDR1 gene expression [19].
In addition, ubiquitin ligase CHIP is involved in degradation of mut p53, and the functional inactivation of CHIP
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

is a cause of aberrant stabilization of mut p53 in cancer
[20]. These relationships were demonstrated in various
MDR cells, in which mut p53 was up-regulated, and CHIP
down-regulated. These results might be responsible for an
increased level of P-gp in MDR cells. The increased level
of P-gp seemed to be associated at least in part with resistance to Hsp90 inhibitors.
It has been known that Hsp90 chaperone activity
is regulated by its acetylation status through modulation
of the HDAC6-Hsp90 chaperone axis, and acetylation of
Hsp90 has been shown to impair the chaperone function of
Hsp90 and target its client proteins for degradation [29, 30].
Hsp70 is also an important cochaperone protein of Hsp90

and is required for the assembly of Hsp90-client protein
complexes, and acetylation of Hsp70 impaired Hsp90
chaperone activity [25]. In the present study, we found
that SIRT1 inhibition promoted the degradation of mut
p53 in MDR cells possibly through hyperacetylation of
Hsp90/Hsp70 and up-regulation of CHIP in the presence
of 17-AAG. Amurensin G also promoted the disruption
of Hsp90-p23 interaction. It has been shown that SAHA’s
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibition of HDAC6, an essential positive regulator of
HSP90, releases mutp53 and enables its MDM2- and
CHIP-mediated degradation [31]. Therefore, SIRT1
inhibition appeared to facilitate disruption of Hsp90
chaperone complexes, and increase binding of mut p53 to
CHIP. In addition, hyperacetylation of mut p53 by SIRT1
inhibition could contribute to down-regulation of P-gp, since
acetylation prevents mut p53 function [32].

It has been reported that P-gp expression in tumor
cells may participate in the efflux of Hsp90-directed
agents such as 17-AAG, and cause resistance to 17-AAGmediated anticancer effects [15]. We found that SIRT1
inhibitors inhibited P-gp-mediated efflux in MCF-7/
MDR and CEM/VBL100 cells via down-regulation of
P-gp, suggesting that SIRT1 inhibitor might be effective
to increase an efficacy of Hsp90 inhibitors through downregulation of P-gp and consequently to sensitize MDR cells
to Hsp90 inhibitors. Since inhibition of SIRT1 could downregulate Hsp70/Hsp27 as well as P-gp in various human
MDR cancer cells, combinatorial targeting of HSF1/Hsps
and P-gp by combined treatment with Hsp90 inhibitor
and SIRT1 inhibitor could be a more effective therapeutic
approach for Hsp90 inhibitor-resistant MDR cells.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Taken together, the present study suggests that
SIRT1 inhibitors would be used to sensitize MDR cells
to Hsp90 inhibitors, possibly through suppression of
activation of HSF1-dependent pathway and P-gp-mediated
efflux activity.

Korea). In brief, MCF7-MDR (or CEM/VLB100) cells
(2×105 cells/ml) were seeded on 6-well plates and
transfected with indicated concentration of SIRT1siRNA
or control siRNA using oligofectamine reagent. After 48
h, cells were treated with 17-AAG for an additional 24 h
and collected for western blotting to determine the levels
of indicated proteins.

Cell proliferation assay

MDR cells (2 × 105 cells/ml) were treated with
17-AAG (1 or 10 μM) in the presence or absence
of amurensin G (5 μg/ml) for 24 h. Then cells were
centrifuged and resuspended in 100 μl of the staining
solution containing Annexin V-fluorescein (FITC
Apoptosis detection kit; BD ParMingen San Diego,
CA,USA) and propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) in in a Hepes buffer. After incubation
at room temperature for 20 min, the percentage of early
and late apoptotic cells was quantified by FACS for
Annexin-V and PI staining.

Apoptosis assessment by annexin v staining

Cell proliferation was measured by using
the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bro­
mide (MTT) assay. Exponentially growing cells
(2 × 104 cells/well) were plated in plated in a 96-well
plate and incubated in growth medium containing the
indicated concentrations of 17-AAG (or AUY922) and/
or amurensin G (or EX527) at 37°C for 96 h. Inhibition
of cell proliferation was expressed as percentages of
untreated control cell growth. At least two separate
experiments were performed in triplicate. Interaction
between 17-AAG (or AUY922) and amurensin G (or
EX527) was assessed using Compu-Syn Software
(ComboSyn, Paramus, NJ, USA). A combination index
(CI) < 0.9 represents drug synergism, 0.9 < CI < 1.1
implies nearly additive interactions, and CI > 1.1
indicates antagonism. All experiments were carried out
in triplicate.

Flow-cytometric dye-efflux assay
Cell suspension (500 μl) of MCF7-MDR (or CEM/
VLB100) cells treated with 17-AAG (AUY922) and/or
amurensin G (EX527) for 24 h incubated with 0.5 μg/ml
rhodamine 123 (Rho123), a fluorescent substrate of P-gp,
at 37°C for 30 min. After incubation, the cells were
washed with ice-cold PBS and further incubated at 37°C
for 3 h to allow P-gp-mediated drug efflux. Cells were
pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g and resuspended in
PBS. Cellular fluorescence was analyzed immediately
by using a FACS flow cytometer (FACScalibur, BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA).

Western blot and co-immunoprecipitation
analysis
Western blot analysis was performed with specific
primary antibodies against SIRT1 and CHIP (Cell
Signaling Technology, MA, USA), Hsp27 (Epitomics,
CA, USA), p53, caspase-3, PARP, Bcl-2, Bax, HSF1,
p23, P-gp and pan-acetylated lysine (pan-AcK) (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA), Hsp70 and Hsp90
(Enzo Life Sciences, Inc.), and β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA). For co-immunoprecipitation,
whole cell extracts from MCF7-MDR cells exposed
to 17-AAG or/and amurensin G were incubated
with indicated antibody overnight at 4°C. Protein
G-Sepharose beads with immunocomplexes were boiled,
electrophoresed on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and
analyzed by western blotting was performed using
indicated antibody.

Statistical analysis
The results obtained were expressed as the mean ±
S.E. of at least three independent experiments. A Student’s
t-test was used to calculate the statistical significance of
the experimental data and the level of significance was set
as *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001.
