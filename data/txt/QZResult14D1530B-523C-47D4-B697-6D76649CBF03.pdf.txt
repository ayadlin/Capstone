Abstract
Resistance to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) blockade in breast cancer is often mediated by activation of
bypass pathways that sustain growth. Src and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) are two intrinsic targets
that are downstream of most RTKs. To date, limited clinical efﬁcacy has been observed with either Src or mTOR
inhibitors when used as single agents. Resistance to mTOR inhibitors is associated with loss of negative feedback
regulation, resulting in phosphorylation and activation of AKT. Herein, we describe a novel role for Src in
contributing to rapalog-induced AKT activation. We found that dual activation of Src and the mTOR pathway
occurs in nearly half of all breast cancers, suggesting potential cross-talk. As expected, rapamycin inhibition of
mTOR results in feedback activation of AKT in breast cancer cell lines. Addition of the Src/c-Abl inhibitor,
dasatinib, completely blocks this feedback activation, conﬁrming convergence between Src and the mTOR
pathway. Analysis in vivo revealed that dual Src and mTOR inhibition is highly effective in two mouse models of
breast cancer. In a luminal disease model, combined dasatinib and rapamycin is more effective at inducing
regression than either single agent. Furthermore, the combination of dasatinib and rapamycin delays tumor
recurrence following the cessation of treatment. In a model of human EGFR-2–positive (HER2þ) disease,
dasatinib alone is ineffective, but potentiates the efﬁcacy of rapamycin. These data suggest that combining mTOR
and Src inhibitors may provide a new approach for treating multiple breast cancer subtypes that may circumvent
resistance to targeted RTK therapies. Cancer Res; 74(17); 4762–71. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Breast cancers that respond to receptor-targeted therapies
and phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) inhibition often
develop resistance and recur. This is because of feedback
activation of AKT, enhanced receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
signaling, or cross-talk with other growth-promoting pathways

(1–3). Growth factor signaling through PI3K/AKT results in
activation of mTOR (4), the catalytic subunit of both the mTOR
complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). These
complexes activate downstream substrates such as the ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K), to regulate cellular metabolism,
proliferation, and motility (5). S6K also has a negative feedback
function, whereby it phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate
1 and 2 (IRS1/2) and uncouples PI3K from RTKs. This results in
decreased AKT activity (6). S6K also directly phosphorylates
the mTORC2 complex, an activating kinase for AKT, further
inhibiting AKT phosphorylation and mTOR signaling (7).
Consequently, inhibiting mTORC1 with rapamycin or its analogs (rapalogs) causes loss of negative feedback pathways,
resulting in sustained AKT activation. This has provided a
molecular rationale for the development and use of dual
mTORC1/2 inhibitors, however, these second generation inhibitors initiate an RTK-driven feedback loop that leads to a new
steady state, with rebound accumulation of activated AKT (8).
It has also been proposed that combined mTOR/PI3K inhibitors would block rapalog-induced feedback activation of this
pathway; however, one such inhibitor (BEZ235) has already
been reported to increase signaling from the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) family, resulting in ERK activation (9).
Thus, it is unlikely that restricted focus on the AKT/mTOR
pathway will be sufﬁcient to produce sustained tumor
regression.

Efﬁcacy of Dual SFK and mTOR Inhibition in Breast Cancer

Growing evidence suggests that the non-RTK Src, and other
Src-family kinases (SFK) may potentiate PI3K/AKT/mTOR
signaling (10–12) to mediate cell-cycle progression and survival (13, 14). In breast cancer, Src is an important mediator of
the same RTKs that activate mTOR, including insulin-like
growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and the EGFR family, as well
as hormone receptors (15, 16). Src directly interacts with, and
activates AKT (17), the primary activator of mTOR. Src kinase
activity is also essential for the activity of the mTORC1
complex, independent of AKT activity (10). S6K activity and
localization can also be regulated by Src (18). Taken together,
the potential crosstalk between these pathways, in addition to
the established roles that both Src and mTOR play in breast
cancer, suggests that dual inhibition of Src and mTOR may
circumvent several mechanisms of resistance to singleagent therapies by intercepting multiple signaling/feedback
pathways.
Dasatinib, a selective Src/c-Abl, multikinase inhibitor, is
currently approved for second line treatment of CML and
Phþ ALL, and several other Src inhibitors are in clinical trials
for solid tumors, both as single agents or in combination, with
preliminary data demonstrating tolerability. However, dasatinib showed limited activity as a single agent in human EGFR2–positive (HER2þ) and/or hormone receptor–positive (HRþ;
ref. 19) and triple-negative (TN) breast cancer (TNBC; ref. 20) in
phase II trials. Given the high frequency of activation of each
pathway in breast cancer (21, 22), we hypothesized that dual
inhibition of Src and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling may overcome the limited clinical efﬁcacy when targeting either pathway alone.
In this study, we show that Src and mTOR are both active in
50% of human breast cancers representing all 4 receptordeﬁned tumor subtypes. Inhibition of SFKs with dasatinib
blocks the rebound activation of AKT that occurs with mTOR
inhibition in breast cancer cell lines representative of HRþ,
HER2þ, and TNBC. We further demonstrate a synergistic effect
on tumor regression when combining dasatinib with rapamycin in 2 mouse models of breast cancer. Finally, we show that
tumor regression is also accompanied by a reduction in
pulmonary metastasis as well as an increase in time to tumor
recurrence. These results support the use of dasatinib, in
combination with mTOR inhibition, as a rational approach
for enhancing the efﬁcacy of mTOR inhibitors in the treatment
of breast cancer. Moreover, these data provide a novel mechanism whereby Src cooperates with mTOR signaling to regulate breast cancer survival and growth.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
All cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) and authenticated by STR proﬁling (BDC
Molecular Biology Core Facility, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO). Cells were maintained at 37 C with 5% CO2. All lines
were propagated in respective media: MCF7 [Dulbeco's Modiﬁed Eagles Medium (DMEM)], BT474 (Hybri-Care Media,
ATCC), and MDA-MB-231 (RPMI-1640), supplemented with
10% FBS. BT474 also received 10 ng/mL human insulin
(Roche). Drug concentrations used for in vitro studies with

www.aacrjournals.org

dasatinib, rapamycin (LC Laboratories), and saracatinib (Selleckchem) were based on previously reported IC50 values in
breast cancer cell lines (23–26). Retroviral vectors for wild-type
Src and dasatinib-resistant Src (Addgene) were used to create
stable populations of MDA-MB-231 cells as previously
described (27).
Protein analysis
Cells and homogenized tissues were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer supplemented with complete protease inhibitors and PhosSTOP (Roche) and proteins were
processed for Western blot analyses as described (28). Immunoblots were probed with antibodies that recognize phosphorylated (Ser473)-AKT, total AKT, phosphorylated (Thr24/32)
FoxO1/3a, phosphorylated (Tyr-416)-Src, total Src, phosphorylated (Thr389) p70S6K, total p70S6K, phosphorylated
(Ser235/236)-S6, total S6 (all from Cell Signaling), and b-actin
(Sigma-Aldrich). Densitometry was performed using ImageJ
(NIH, rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/).
Cell-cycle and apoptosis analysis
Cell-cycle analysis was performed as previously described
(28). Annexin V staining for apoptotic cells was completed per
the manufacturer's protocol. Brieﬂy, cells were incubated with
FITC-conjugated Annexin V (Molecular Probes). Following
addition of propidium iodide (PI; Sigma), stained cells were
analyzed by ﬂow cytometry and percent apoptotic cells
(Annexin V–positive, PI-negative) quantiﬁed.
Animal and drug trials
All animal work was approved by the Case Western Reserve
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. FVB/
N-Tg(MMTV-PyVT)634Mul/J (MMTV-PyMT) mice, which
overexpress the Polyoma Virus Middle-T Antigen (PyMT), and
FVB-Tg(MMTV-Erbb2)NK1Mul/J (MMTV-NeuT) mice, which
express the activated rat neu (HER2) oncogene, were purchased
from the Jackson Laboratory and bred with FVB/N mice to
generate cohorts of tumor-bearing females. For the MMTVPyMT recurrence studies and the MMTV-NeuT cohort, established primary tumors were removed from transgenic mice and
a piece of tumor smaller than 1 mm3 in size was implanted into
the inguinal mammary fat pad of adult syngeneic FVB/N
females [genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM)–
derived allografts (GDA)]. Mice were palpated weekly for
tumor formation and monitored for toxicity by assessing
grooming and weight. Once tumor volumes reached 300
mm3 for all models, mice were randomized to receive vehicle,
dasatinib alone, rapamycin alone, or combined dasatinib and
rapamycin. Doses were identiﬁed based on previous in vivo
studies and the murine pharmacokinetics of dasatinib and
rapamycin (29–31). Dasatinib was suspended in 50% propylene
glycol/50% sterile water and administered by daily oral gavage
at 15 mg/kg. Rapamycin was reconstituted with 5.2% Tween80/
5.2% polyethylene glycol in 0.9% saline and injected i.p., every
other day, at 7.5 mg/kg. Tumor measurements were recorded
using calipers and volumes calculated using the formula
(length  width2/2). For the MMTV-PyMT cohort, tumors
from vehicle-treated mice were only measured at 4 and 15

days of treatment because the primary tumors were too large
to continue this cohort for 30 days. All other treatment groups
were analyzed for a period of 4, 15, or 30 days. Tumors from the
MMTV-NeuT cohort were analyzed after 15 days of treatment.
For the MMTV-PyMT recurrence study, single agent and
combination-treated mice were monitored for 14 and 28 days,
respectively, after last drug administration.
Response criteria
The percent change in tumor volume from baseline at 4, 15
and 30 days was used to quantify response. Progressive disease
(PD), stable disease (SD), partial response (PR), and complete
response (CR) were deﬁned according to RECIST criteria (32).
Ninety-ﬁve percent or greater decrease in tumor volume was
used to deﬁne CR. This cutoff, based on histological evaluation,
was chosen to account for the limited accuracy in caliper
measurements of small masses. Residual masses of less than
5% were ﬁbrotic tissue with little to no viable tumor.
Histology and immunohistochemistry
Mammary tumors and lungs were collected within 3 hours of
the last treatment and placed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS,
ﬁxed for 4 hours at room temperature, and transferred to 1
PBS before parafﬁn embedding and sectioning. Immunohistochemistry was performed utilizing the Dako Envision Plus
Rabbit HRP Kit. Antigen retrieval was achieved by incubating
slides in a decloaking chamber for 15 minutes at 125 C in
10 mmol/L citrate buffer (pH 6.0) or 10 mmol/L Tris/EDTA
(pH 8.0). Sections were blocked with peroxidase blocking
reagent along with 15 mL/mL normal goat serum (Jackson
ImmunoResearch) and then incubated with indicated primary
antibodies overnight at 4 C. Secondary antibody was applied
and detected by 3,30 -diaminobenzidine reaction. The sections
were counterstained with Gill's hematoxylin 3 (Fisher Scientiﬁc), dehydrated, cleared, and mounted with Permount
(Fisher Scientiﬁc).
Analysis of human breast tumors
Approval was obtained from the Case Western Reserve
University Cancer Institutional Review Board before initiating
these studies. De-identiﬁed, parafﬁn-embedded tissues were
collected from the University Hospitals Case Medical Center
Department of Pathology Archives. Samples were sectioned
and immunohistochemistry was performed as described for
mouse tissues. All samples were blindly scored by 2 independent pathologists. Scores were assigned based on 2 parameters;
percent of tumor that is positive (10% ¼ 1, 20% ¼ 2, 30% ¼ 3,
etc.) and staining intensity (1þ, 2þ, 3þ). The ﬁnal score was
calculated as the product of the intensity and percentage
scores with the highest value being 30 [3þ  10 (100%
stained)]. A section with a combined score  1 was deemed
to have positive staining for p-Src or p-S6.
Statistical analysis
Differences in expression of p-Src and p-S6 among human
breast tumors subtypes were compared using Fisher exact test.
Animal data were analyzed with SAS v9.2. For comparison of
tumor sizes, the log of the tumor sizes at each measured time

4764

point was used as the dependent variable. A generalized mixed
model incorporating repeated measures over 4 days, 2 weeks,
or 4 weeks of treatment was used to compare groups. The data
were adjusted for baseline tumor size at treatment initiation.
Each mouse was analyzed as a random effect. P values for body
weight differences associated with treatment effects and ﬁnal
tumor weights were calculated using 2-tailed Student t tests.
Poisson regression was used to ascertain differences in the
number of metastases between the treatment groups. There
was one extreme outlier in the MMTV-PyMT vehicle-treated
group, which did not allow appropriate ﬁtting of the model.
Hence, the data were analyzed omitting this outlier. The
direction of the ﬁndings was consistent with what would be
expected if the outlier were incorporated, making this a
conservative omission. Tumor regression and staining for
p-Src and p-S6 among treatment groups were compared using
Fisher exact test for both the MMTV-PyMT and MMTV-NeuT
models. P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically
signiﬁcant.

Results
Coactivation of Src and the mTOR pathway in human
breast tumors
To assess the potential for Src and mTOR pathway interactions in breast cancer, we examined the extent of their coactivation in 60 human tumors representing the four receptordeﬁned subtypes. Immunostaining for activated Src (p-Src)
and mTOR pathway activation (p-S6; Fig. 1A) revealed that
nearly 50% of breast tumors simultaneously activate these two
pathways, with HER2þ tumors having the highest frequency of
coactivation (Fig. 1B). However, the absolute levels of p-Src and
p-S6 are not correlated (Supplementary Fig. S1), suggesting
that, whereas these two proteins may converge on a common
signaling pathway, they do not depend on one another for basal
activation.
Dasatinib prevents rapamycin-induced feedback
activation of AKT through inhibition of SFKs
We next asked whether SFKs may impact the well-described
feedback activation of AKT that occurs with mTOR inhibitors
such as rapamycin (33). We ﬁrst conﬁrmed this feedback
activation in human breast cancer cell lines, representing
luminal (MCF7), HER2þ (BT474), and TN (MDA-MB-231)
subtypes. Escalating doses of rapamycin (1–100 nmol/L)
resulted in increased phosphorylation of AKT (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). This feedback activation was observed as early as 30
minutes in the BT474 cells, and peak phosphorylation occurred
in less than 24 hours in all lines (Supplementary Fig. S2B). To
examine the effect of SFK inhibition on rapaplog-induced
feedback activation, cells were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), dasatinib, rapamycin, or the combination of dasatinib
and rapamycin for 1, 24, and 48 hours (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S3). As expected, rapamycin increased the phosphorylation and activation of AKT. However, this feedback
activation was eradicated by addition of dasatinib. Although
rapamycin can induce Src activation in some cell lines (34), we
found no consistent induction of Src activation upon

rapamycin treatment in the 3 breast cancer cell lines tested
(Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). Of note, dasatinib inhibits
phosphorylation of S6 in both BT474 and MDA-MB-231 cells
(Fig. 2A), and the MCF7 cells in low serum conditions (data not
shown), consistent with the previous observation that S6K is a
Src substrate (18). Surprisingly, inhibition of AKT activity, with
the combination of dasatinib and rapamycin, did not increase
apoptosis to a greater extent than the most effective single
agent drug for each cell line (Supplementary Fig. S4).
These data suggest that Src potentiates PI3K/AKT signaling
downstream of mTOR, however, dasatinib inhibits a number of
additional kinases. To determine if another Src inhibitor has
the same effects as dasatinib, MDA-MB-231 cells were similarly
treated with saracatinib. This resulted in decreased phosphorylation of Src, and, like dasatinib, completely blocked the
feedback activation of AKT that occurs with rapamycin treatment (Fig. 2B). To further assess the impact of Src, MDA-MB231 cells were generated that stably express wild-type Src (Src
wt) or a dasatininb-resistant Src (Src DR; Fig. 2C). Rapamycin
still induced phosphorylation of AKT in the presence of either
Src (Fig. 2D). However, although dasatinib blocked AKT activation in the Src (wt) cells, it was not able to block this
induction in the Src (DR) cells. Thus, dasatinib prevents
rapalog feedback on AKT by inhibiting Src or another SFK.
Combined dasatinib and rapamycin treatment induces
tumor regression, inhibits metastasis, and delays
recurrence of PyMT-induced mammary tumors
To investigate the efﬁcacy of dual SFK and mTOR inhibition
in vivo, MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice (35) were treated with

vehicle, dasatinib, rapamycin, or combined dasatinib plus
rapamycin for up to 30 days. No evidence of toxicity was
observed (Supplementary Fig. S5A). We ﬁrst evaluated the
phosphorylation status of downstream signaling components
of both pathways in the MMTV-PyMT tumors after only 3
hours of treatment. Similar to the in vitro analysis of breast
cancer cell lines (Fig. 2), dasatinib not only blocks the increase
in AKT phosphorylation observed with rapamycin, but also
reduces p-AKT levels to below those of vehicle-treated control
(Fig. 3A).
Using a 4-day treatment paradigm, many tumors completely
regressed following combined drug treatment. In contrast,
tumor response in mice treated with either agent alone included growth, stasis, and partial regression (Supplementary Fig.
S6A). Indeed, representative magnetic resonance images demonstrated the disappearance of identiﬁable tumor mass in the
combination-treated group (Fig. 3B). By day 15 of treatment,
response rates of 25% and 63% (deﬁned by RECIST criteria)
were observed in dasatinib- and rapamycin-treated tumors,
respectively (Fig. 3C); however, few achieved CR (dasatinib,
28%; rapamycin, 10%). The remaining mice in these two
treatment groups displayed SD and PD, respectively. In contrast to the single agents, combining rapamycin with dasatinib
induced PRs or CRs in all mice, with the majority of tumors
(70%) regressing to below the limit of palpable detection (Fig.
3C and D and Supplementary Fig. S6B). Immunohistochemical
analyses conﬁrmed sustained inhibition of p-Src and p-S6 by
dasatinib and rapamycin, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S7).
Although dasatinib can inhibit the development of metastases in mouse models (36, 37), the data concerning the

A, dasatinib blocks rapamycin-induced activation of AKT (pAKT), in vivo. MMTV-PyMT mice bearing mammary tumors of 300 mm were treated
with vehicle, dasatinib, rapamycin, or the combination of dasatinib and rapamycin for 3 hours. Immunoblot analysis was performed on tumor lysates using
antibodies against the indicated phosphorylated (p-) or total (t-) proteins and b-actin. B, magnetic resonance images of tumor-bearing MMTV-PyMT
mice were obtained on day 1, just before treatment, and on day 4 of treatment with the indicated drug(s). Shown are representative coronal T2-weighted
images with tumors outlined in yellow dashes. Arrowheads in the day 4 image from the combination-treated mouse indicate the location of tumors at
day 1 that had completely regressed. Results are representative of three animals imaged per treatment group. C, waterfall plot of tumors from

role of SFKs in tumor progression and metastasis (40), and
single-agent rapamycin treatment had minimal effect (Supplementary Fig. S8). Addition of rapamycin to dasatinib
offered no beneﬁt over dasatinib alone, nor did it negatively
impact the efﬁcacy of dasatinib in reducing metastases.
It has been proposed that dasatinib targets the "cancerstem cell" or tumor-initiating cells responsible for metastasis
and recurrence (41). Thus, we hypothesized that the synergistic effects seen with combination of rapamycin and
dasatinib on primary tumor regression would translate into
a delay in time to recurrence. Mice bearing MMTV-PyMT
mammary tumors of 300 mm3 were treated with vehicle,
dasatinib, rapamycin, or the combined drugs for 2 weeks. At
the end of treatment, tumors were measured and monitored
for regrowth. Within 14 days after treatment cessation, most
tumors from single agent-treated mice were larger than the
initial tumor volume (Fig. 4), whereas tumors from combination-treated mice remained undetectable. By 28 days, 78%
of tumors treated with the combined drugs had recurred,
but only 33% were as large as the starting tumor. This
considerable delay in tumor recurrence suggests an added
beneﬁt of the combined drugs for extending recurrence-free
survival.

withdrawn at 2 weeks and mice were palpated biweekly for tumor
regrowth. The addition of dasatinib to rapamycin delayed recurrence
by greater than 2 weeks (14 days vs. 28 days) compared with single
agent–treated mice.

wherein 100% of the combination-treated animals displayed
PRs or CRs. In contrast, rapamycin alone resulted primarily in
PD and SD whereas all mice in the dasatinib-treated group
displayed PD, indistinguishable from the vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 5B). Thus, dasatinib was completely ineffective as a
single agent, yet clearly potentiated the efﬁcacy of rapamycin in
HER2-induced tumors.

Discussion
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease that has beneﬁted
from the development of subtype-speciﬁc–targeted treatment
paradigms. Single-agent hormone therapy and RTK-targeted
therapies have shown signiﬁcant efﬁcacy, increasing both
disease-free and overall survival. However, de novo and
acquired resistance is a common barrier to the use of receptor-targeted therapies. Furthermore, patients with TN disease
are left with limited treatment options other than systemic
chemotherapy. The extensive redundancy of RTK signaling,
coupled with an increased appreciation of the potential for
growth factor–driven resistance to kinase inhibitors (2),
requires the identiﬁcation of a novel approach to target cancer
cells. We have focused on the combinatorial blockade of two
critical downstream effectors frequently dysregulated in most
breast cancers. To date, Src and mTOR pathway coactivation in
human breast tumors has not been evaluated. Our analysis
revealed a high percentage of breast tumors with coactivation
of both pathways (Fig. 1B). Studies aimed at identifying molecular markers predictive of a "dasatinib-response" suggest that
the TN, or basal-like subtype is most sensitive to this agent (43).
Anbalagan and colleagues reported that total Src and p-Src are
increased in TNBC compared with ERþBC (21). Interestingly,
we found that the hormone receptor negative/HER2þ subtype
had the highest percent of tumors with Src and mTOR pathway
coactivation (Fig. 1B), suggesting that these tumors may be
particularly responsive to the combination of dasatinib and
mTOR inhibition.
A major obstacle to mTOR-targeted therapies is an increase
in the active, phosphorylated form of the prosurvival factor
AKT. This is because of the loss of negative feedback regulation
(see review; ref. 1 and Fig. 6). The ability of dasatinib to prevent
this feedback activation of AKT in breast cancer cell lines, as
well as PyMT tumors (Figs. 2A and 3A), suggests essential
crosstalk between SFKs and the mTOR pathway. Indeed, we
have shown that dual inhibition of SFKs and mTOR signaling
leads to signiﬁcant tumor regression in two highly credentialed, RTK-driven mouse models of mammary tumorigenesis,
further indicating the importance of the intersection between
the mTOR and SFK pathways. Multiple phase II and III clinical
trials are currently evaluating either Src or mTOR inhibitors as
single agents, or combined with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapies, as well as targeted therapies, for the treatment of
breast cancer and other malignancies. Recently, the ﬁrst phase
I trial for the combination of rapamycin plus dasatinib (for the
treatment of refractory neuroblastoma) was initiated (ClinicalTrials.gov) based on several in vitro studies showing a
synergistic effect on cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. However,
this is the ﬁrst preclinical in vivo evidence demonstrating a

mary tumor initiation by HER2 (44). Recently, Karim and
colleagues reported that dasatinib delays tumor onset in a
mouse model of HER2þ disease that also has chronically active
AKT through PTEN loss, but tumor growth was not inhibited
(45). Together, these data indicate that Src/SFKs may be
necessary for HER2-induced tumor initiation but not sustained
growth. Conversely, in the studies reported herein, addition of

We found that dasatinib alone is not sufﬁcient to induce

(Fig. 3D), and is completely ineffective in the model of HER2þ
disease (Fig. 5B). Our results mirror clinical studies where
dasatinib, as a single agent, is ineffective in multiple breast

Figure 6. Model of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and the effects of targeting mTOR and SFKs. A, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is tightly regulated by multiple
feedback loops (dashed lines) to control growth factor signaling. B, aberrant RTK signaling in tumor cells can override this regulation and addition of mTOR
inhibitors (C) can further increase activation of AKT. This occurs through multiple mechanisms, including derepression of the negative feedback loops,
whereby S6K induces degradation of IRS-1/2 (uncoupling RTK signaling to PI3K) and S6K inhibits the mTORC2 complex. D, we report that rapalog-induced
activation of AKT can be blocked with the dual Src/c-Abl inhibitor, dasatinib; however, the speciﬁc SFK(s) and directed downstream targets are unknown. As
both Src kinase and mTOR pathway activity are found to be increased in breast cancer, these ﬁndings suggest pathway convergence that promotes tumor
viability. This novel convergence reveals a potential vulnerability and supports the use of combinatorial agents that act downstream of RTKs.

These distinct outcomes are likely because of the fact that
mTOR inhibition has additional consequences other than
simply activating AKT, including loss of protein synthesis.
Thus, rapamycin-treated tumors are already compromised
and the blockade of AKT survival signaling by dasatinib
potentiates the effects of rapamycin.
In vitro, alterations in proliferation and/or apoptosis
between single-agent and combination treatment were not
signiﬁcant (data not shown and Supplementary Fig. S4), suggesting the in vivo synthetic lethality is likely the result of
combined extrinsic effects on the tumor microenvironment/
vasculature as well as signaling within the tumor. Indeed,
endothelial AKT signaling has been proposed as the ratelimiting event for rapamycin inhibition of PyMT mammary
tumor progression (46). We and others have shown that, in
several different mouse models of breast cancer, rapamycin
induces extensive coagulating necrosis, which may be attributed to inhibition of angiogenesis (29, 47–49). Although this is
sufﬁcient to induce cytostasis, it is not effective at eliminating
the tumor. In addition to the tumor cell–autonomous effects of
dasatinib, there is also evidence for extrinsic effects of this drug
on the tumor vasculature and stroma. In preclinical models of
multiple myeloma, dasatinib inhibits tumor vessel growth,
which correlates with combined targeting of platelet-derived
growth factor receptor b (PDGFRb) and vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor (VEGFR)/c-Src signaling pathways (50).
In lung carcinoma, dasatinib partially reverts cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts toward a phenotypically normal state, and this
is associated with reduced tumor cell proliferation (51). We
hypothesize that the combinatorial effect of both drugs
observed in vivo results from the ability of dasatinib to eliminate the remaining tumor cells that are compromised, but not
killed, by the effects of rapamycin, through effects on the tumor
and the microenvironment.
In summary, we have identiﬁed a novel therapeutic
approach for multiple subtypes of breast cancer that circumvents receptor targeting. The ability of dasatinib to signiﬁ-

cantly augment the effects of mTOR inhibition in vivo identiﬁes
an intrinsic vulnerability in breast cancer cells. Although it is
well established that mTOR inhibitors induce rebound activation of AKT, no studies have placed Src within this feedback
pathway. Our ﬁndings indicate that one or several SFKs
converge on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway to regulate tumor
viability. Identifying which SFK(s) modulate reactivation of
AKT in response to rapamycin will lend further insight into the
mechanism(s) of feedback regulation. The combined use of
dasatinib and mTOR inhibitors has not yet been evaluated in
patients for breast cancer and the results presented herein
provide a rationale for clinical assessment of the safety and
efﬁcacy of this approach.
