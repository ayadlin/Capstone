ABSTRACT
Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3) supports tumor
lymphangiogenesis. It was originally identified as a lymphangiogenic factor
expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells. VEGFR-3 was detected in advanced
human malignancies and correlated with poor prognosis. Our previous studies show
that activation of the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 axis promotes cancer metastasis and is
associated with clinical progression in patients with lung cancer, indicating that
VEGFR-3 is a potential target for cancer therapy. In this study, we developed eight
peptides targeting VEGFR-3. Two peptides strongly inhibited the kinase activity
of VEGFR-3 and suppressed VEGF-C-mediated invasion of cancer cells. Moreover,
these peptides abolished VEGF-C-induced drug resistance and tumor initiating cell
formation. This study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of VEGFR-3-targeting
peptides.

receptors are typically overexpressed in tumors relative
to normal tissues [1]. Although efforts to develop
small molecules, such as sunitinib and sorafenib,
are ongoing, most of these chemical agents have a
narrow therapeutic window because of serious toxicity

to normal tissues. Therapeutic peptides with low
toxicity and high specificity are therefore one of the
most promising options for cancer treatment because
of they are of low molecular weight and are easily
synthesized.
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) were the first
kinases to be linked to tumorigenesis and stand as
ideal targets for the development of targeted cancer
therapies. Agents targeting RTKs in cancer include
small molecules, therapeutic antibodies, and blocking
peptides. Monoclonal antibodies to VEGFR-1 block
tumor migration, invasion and colony formation in vitro
in VEGFR-1-expressing human colon cancer cells [2].
More recently, Wu et al. demonstrated that an antiVEGFR-1 monoclonal antibody abolished its signal
transduction and the subsequent growth of human
breast tumors [3]. Furthermore, a phase II clinical trial
suggested that treatment with bevacizumab attenuated
the activation of VEGFR-2 in human breast tumors [4].
These studies indicate that VEGFRs are ideal targets for
the development of therapeutic agents because they are
overexpressed and functional in tumor cells.
The VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 axis has been documented
as a gatekeeper signaling pathway for triggering
lymphangiogenesis, which is an important step in
tumor progression. The activation of VEGFR-3
induces the formation of lymphatic vessels within and
around tumors and enhances metastatic spread via the
lymphatics [2, 5, 6]. Similar to angiogenesis, a tumor
can induce its own network of lymphatics that connect
to the surrounding lymphatic vessels. Indeed, clinical
and pathological observations suggest that for many
carcinomas, the transport of tumor cells by lymphatics is
the most common pathway of initial dissemination, such
that cancers spread by afferent lymphatics that follow
natural routes of drainage [7]. In addition to its role in
lymphangiogenesis, the expression of VEGFR-3 has
been correlated with poor survival in colon cancer [8].
VEGFR-3 expression has also been correlated with
advanced stages of cervical carcinogenesis [9].
Moreover, the activation of the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 axis
was shown to protect leukemic cells from the apoptotic
effects of chemotherapeutic agents such as cytarabine,
doxorubicin and etoposide [10]. Our previous studies
provided evidence that the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 axis
enhances cancer cell mobility and invasiveness,
contributes to the promotion of cancer metastasis, and is
closely correlated with clinical metastasis and survival
in patients with lung cancer [11]. We also found that
blocking the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 axis dramatically
decreased cancer metastasis in an animal model [11].
These results strongly suggest that VEGFR-3 is a crucial
RTK and that its therapeutic potential strongly merits
further investigation.

Identification of peptide sequences that bind to
human VEGFR-3
Our previous studies [11, 12] suggested that the
identification of VEGFR-3-targeting peptides for cancer
treatment is important and highly feasible. To identify
peptides that bind VEGFR-3, we established a phage
display technique to screen a 7-mer random cyclic peptide
phage library. A random 7-mer peptide phage library
composed of 2 × 109 independent phage clones was
obtained from a biopanning screen against plate-bound
soluble VEGFR-3 (sR3). The VEGFR-3-bound phages
were recovered by elution with acidic buffer. For each
biopanning, the number of phages (pfu) in the inputs and
outputs were compared to determine the degree of selection.
Eight phage clones were identified for further studies based
on their VEGFR-3 binding affinity (Table 1). Supplemental
Figure S1 shows the structure and residues of each peptide.

VEGFR-3-targeting peptides block the
interaction between VEGF-C and VEGFR-3
and the inhibit kinase activity of VEGFR-3
To examine the ability and the affinity of
selected peptides to bind sVEGFR-3, an in vitro
competition assay was performed. These peptides were
added to sVEGFR-3-coated wells to compete with
VEGF-C binding, and bound VEGF-C was detected by
ELISA. The P4, P5 and P6 peptides reduced the levels
of bound VEGF-C in a significant and dose-dependent
manner, whereas no obvious change was found among
other peptides (Figure 1A). This result indicates that the
P4, P5 and P6 peptides block the binding of VEGF-C
to sVEGFR-3 and suggests that these VEGFR-3binding peptides may affect the activation of VEGFR-3.
To investigate the inhibitory effects of these candidate

peptides to pan-lab (Ricerca Lab) to measure VEGFR-3
kinase activity. The P5, P6, P7 and P8 peptides exhibited
the highest inhibitory effects on VEGFR-3 kinase
activity (82% for P5, 72% for P6, 69% for P7 and 49%
for P8) (Figure 1B). Moreover, we also analyzed the
effects of these peptides on VEGFR-3 activity by kinase
receptor activation enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (KIRA-ELISA) [13]. The candidate peptides were
pre-incubated with VEGF-C-treated H928 lung cancer
cells, and whole-cell lysates were harvested to determine
tyr-phosphorylated VEGFR-3 by KIRA-ELISA. The P5
and P6 peptides consistently showed the highest inhibitory

effects on the phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 (Figure 1C).
These results clearly show that the P5 and P6 peptides
bind to VEGFR-3 and reduce the activity of VEGFR-3.

It has been reported that tyrosine residues 1063
and 1068 (Tyr1063/1068) in VEGFR-3 enhance
VEGFR-3 activation and function [14, 15]. We further

peptides on VEGFR-3 phosphorylation. To test their

expression (293T/VEGFR-3) were treated with peptides
for 24 hours and then assayed to determine VEGF-Cinduced VEGFR-3 Tyr1063/1068 phosphorylation. Both
the P5 and P6 peptides exhibited dramatic suppressive
effects on VEGFR-3 phosphorylation in A549 and
human embryonic kidney 293T cells (Figure 2A and 2B).
In our previous study, we identified that the VEGF-C/

VEGFR-3 axis-mediated invasion of human cancer cells
required the activation of the Src-p38-C/EBP-dependent
pathway [11]. To investigate whether the peptides
inhibited the VEGFR-3-mediated signaling pathway,
we also determined the effects of these peptides on
Src phosphorylation. Consistent with the patterns of
phospho-VEGFR-3, decreased phospho-Src levels were
found in the P5 and P6 peptide-treated A549 and 293T/
VEGFR-3 cells (Figure 2A and 2B). Furthermore, a
dose-dependent decrease in phospho-VEGFR-3 and
3826

phospho-Src were also observed in cells that were
treated with increasing doses of the P5 and P6 peptides
(Figure 2C and 2D). These results confirm that the P5
and P6 peptides are the most effective candidates among
these peptides that can block VEGFR-3 activation and
suppress its downstream signaling pathway.

VEGFR-3-mediated chemoresistance, these rhVEGF-Ctreated cells were pre-incubated with the peptides and
then flow cytometry and trypan blue exclusion assays
were performed. Interestingly, the VEGFR-3-targeting
peptides significantly abolished rhVEGF-C-induced
drug resistance in A549 cells as measured by both
the flow cytometric and trypan blue exclusion assays
(Figure 3E-3H) and an MTT assay (Supplemental
Figure S3).

The P5 and P6 peptides suppress VEGF-Cinduced migration, invasion and drug
resistance in cancer cells

The P5 and P6 peptides decrease VEGF-C/
VEGFR-3 signaling, cell mobility and cancer
stemness

Previous studies indicated that VEGF-C promoted
cancer cell survival, proliferation and metastasis [11,
12, 16]. Because the P5 and P6 peptides showed a
stronger potential to inhibit VEGFR-3 activity, we next
focused on determining their effects on cancer cell
migration and invasion. A549 lung cancer cells and
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with endogenous
VEGFR-3/VEGF-C expression were treated with the
peptides and then evaluated for migration and invasion
abilities by using the Boyden chamber assay. Obvious
decreases in migration and invasion were observed in
the P5 and P6 peptide-treated A549 and MDA-MB-231
cells (Figure 3A-3D). This evidence suggests that the
P5 and P6 peptides not only suppressed VEGFR-3
activation but also subsequently diminished cancer
cell migration and invasion. It has been reported that
VEGF-C helps cancer cells to survive Taxol treatment
via downregulation of mTORC1 function in prostate
and pancreatic cancers [17]; additionally, VEGF-C was
shown to enhance cisplatin-resistance through NF-κB
activation in gastric cancer [18]. Moreover, VEGF-Cinduced Akt activation has been suggested to promote
prostate cancer cell survival [19]. Depletion of VEGF-C
has further been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and
cell invasion in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
[20]. VEGFR-3 overexpression or activation also confers
chemo-resistance to treatment in leukemia cancer by
enhancing Bcl-2 expression [10]. We further assessed
whether VEGFR-3-targeting peptides promote cancer
cell chemosensitization. First, recombinant human
VEGF-C (rhVEGF-C)-treated A549 cells were exposed
to Taxol or cisplatin to investigate the functional role of
VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 in drug resistance. We used DNA
flow cytometric assays, trypan blue exclusion and MTT
assays to detect the effects of VEGF-C on drug resistance
in A549 cells. The cell viability of Taxol and cisplatininduced cell death with different concentrations of
VEGF-C was therefore tested (Supplemental Figure S2).
Treatment with rh-VEGF-C significantly increased cell
survival in the presence of Taxol or cisplatin, which
indicated that the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 axis plays a
protective role when cancer cells are exposed to anticancer drugs (Supplemental Figure S2). To further
confirm whether these peptides could block VEGF-C/

The VEGF-C receptor VEGFR-3 (FLT-4) is
predominantly expressed by lymphatic endothelia in
normal adult human tissues [21]. VEGF-C has been
suggested to promote the proliferation of lymphatic
endothelia cells (LECs) and to be a molecular link
between tumor lymphangiogenesis and metastasis
[6]. We were therefore interested in studying whether
the P5 and P6 peptides inhibit VEGF-C/VEGFR-3
signaling and cell migration and proliferation in LECs.
Our data indicated that VEGF-C-induced VEGFR-3
phosphorylation, cell migration and proliferation
of LECs were abolished by the P5 and P6 peptides
(Figure 4A). We further determined whether the P5
and P6 peptides inhibited VEGFR-3 phosphorylation,
cell migration and invasion in various cancer cell
lines (breast cancer cell lines: MDA-MB-231, BT474,
HS578T, HBL100, MDA-MB-361, and MCF-7; lung
cancer cell lines: CL1-5, H460 and H322) (Figure 4B-4E
and Supplemental Figure S4). Our results indicated that
the P5 and P6 peptides significantly inhibited VEGFC-induced VEGFR-3 phosphorylation, cell migration
and invasion in various cancer cell lines. Moreover,
tumor-initiating cells (TICs) play important roles in
regulating tumorigenesis, metastasis, and resistance to
chemotherapy [22, 23]. It has been reported that downregulation of VEGF-C decreases the TIC features of
A549 cells [24]. Because VEGF-C was able to protect
cancer cells from chemotherapy and was also necessary
for maintaining TICs, we first investigated whether
VEGF-C expression could increase the population of
TICs. A549 and MCF-7 cells were incubated under
conditions that favor cancer stem cell growth and then
analyzed for their sphere-forming capacity representing
their tumor-initiating phenotypes. Our results showed
that rhVEGF-C treatment dramatically increased sphere
number and size, which suggests an increase of TICs
in both cell lines (Supplemental Figure S5). To further
determine whether VEGFR-3-targeting peptides could
abrogate VEGF-C-induced TIC formation, the P5
and P6 peptides were co-treated in the presence of
rhVEGF-C. The treatment of the P5 peptide decreased

expression of SOX2 (Supplemental Figure S6), which

has been documented as a molecular feature of TICs
[25, 26]. These data indicate another function of
the VEGFR-3-targeting peptides in regulating TIC
formation.

DISCUSSION

[12, 27]. VEGFR-3 is activated by its ligand VEGF-C,
which results in the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues.
Such phosphorylation events are known to regulate
receptor kinase activity and signal transduction in cancer
cells [14, 15, 28]. VEGFR-3 is therefore one of the most

Previous experimental and clinical studies have
demonstrated that VEGFR-3 plays critical roles in
lymphangiogenesis and in the metastatic spread of tumors

attractive targets for anticancer therapeutics that are
designed to restrict cancer progression. In this study, we
identified two novel small peptides that exhibit anti-tumor
effects, including the suppression of migration, invasion,
drug resistance, and TIC formation (Figure 5C). These
peptides may be potential candidate for controlling tumor
metastasis and chemotherapeutic resistance.
For several decades, the surface receptors of cancer
cells have been successfully used as molecular targets for
cancer therapy and diagnosis because of the overexpression
of these receptors in tumors relative to normal tissues.
Considering its key roles in tumor metastasis and
lymphangiogenesis, the targeting of VEGFR-3 will be
therapeutically significant for human tumors. The activation
of the VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 axis has been found to promote
the resistance of leukemic cells to chemotherapeutic drugs
such as cisplatin, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and etoposide
[10]. In this study, we not only identified a protective
effect of VRGFR-3 in solid tumor cells in response to drug
treatment but also confirmed the therapeutic effects of
VRGFR-3-targeting peptides in the sensitization of cancer
cells treated with Taxol and cisplatin. In addition, the
VEGFR-3/VEGF-C axis has been shown to maintain the
features of TICs that facilitate cancer cells to become more
resistant to drugs and have stronger metastatic abilities
[24, 29]. We found that the VEGFR-3-targeting peptides
decreased the number of VEGF-C/VEGFR-3-induced
TIC formation in lung and breast cancer cells. These data
suggest that VEGFR-3-targeting peptides have multiple
anticancer functions. Thus, the continued studies of
VEGFR-3-targeting agents will be essential for developing
new therapies that limit the spread of cancer.
Peptides are considered suitable for cancer
treatment because of their low molecular weight and easy
synthesis. Therapeutic peptides require high specificity,
bioavailability, and stability. However, the major
limitations of peptides that are used in the human body
include fast proteolytic cleavage, a short half-life, and low
bioavailability. Significant advances have been achieved
through the modification of synthesis strategies, which
include PEGylation, lipidization, and multimerization.
These modifications decrease renal clearance, enhance
water solubility, and improve delivery efficiency. These
modifications therefore greatly enhance the stability,
half-life, and bioavailability of the peptides, which make
them promising solutions for accelerating the translation
of peptides from biologically active agents to successful
clinical drugs. Recent studies of therapeutic peptides make
the peptide-based cancer therapy an attractive approach
because without problems with affinity, specificity and
safety, peptides may be superior to small molecules and
antibodies [30]. Thus, the targeting of surface receptors
that are overexpressed in tumor cells by peptides will be
one of the most promising approaches for cancer therapy
in the future. Currently, more than 70 therapeutic peptides

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

are on the market, and hundreds of peptides are in clinical
and preclinical trials. Many pharmaceutical companies
are working on the development of bioactive peptides.
With advances in modifications, peptides can target
cancer in a more ‘natural’ way that is comparable with
the endogenous system because it requires high selectivity
and potency combined with low toxicity of the peptides
themselves and their cleavage products. Accordingly,
peptide drugs are truly innovative in pharmaceutical
research for many applications. Here we identified novel
peptides with significant effects on blocking VEGFR-3,
which is important and valuable for further investigations
of novel therapeutic strategies in cancer patients.

of 3% H3PO4. Aliquots were removed and counted to
determine the amount of [32P] Poly(Glu:Tyr) that formed.
Compounds were screened at 10 μM. All peptides were
analyzed by Eurofins Panlabs Taiwan Ltd.

The procedure for screening the phage display library
was modified according to the manufacturer (New England
Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Culture dishes were coated with
human soluble VEGFR-3 (sVEGFR-3). sVEGFR-3 was
added at 100 ng/mL and incubated at 4°C for 24 hours
before blocking with phosphate buffer containing 1%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 hour at 37°C. The phage
library containing 2 × 109 clones was sequentially added to
non-bait-coated dishes for preabsorption. In each case, the
library was shaken gently at room temperature for 1 hour.
Finally, the preabsorbed library was applied to sVEGFR-3–
coated dishes for further screening. After thorough washing,
plate-bound phage clones were eluted with elution buffer
[0.22 mol/L glycine-HCl (pH 2.2)] and immediately
neutralized. Four rounds of selection were done, after which
individual plaques were picked at random and subjected to
analysis by phage ELISA and DNA sequencing following
amplification in E. coli ER2537.

Western blot analysis
Cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM/
F12 for 24 hours before treatment with or without
rhVEGF-C (100 ng/mL). Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer
[Tris-HCl (50 mM; pH 7.5), NaCl (120 mM), NP-40
(0.5%), Na3VO4 (200 mM), EDTA (100 mM), sodium
deoxycholate (0.5%), SDS (1%)] for 10 minutes on
ice. An equal quantity of protein from the cell lysates
was resuspended in gel sample buffer, resolved by 10%
SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane membranes (Millipore Corp., Milford,
MA). After blocking, membranes were incubated with
specific primary antibodies and corresponding secondary
antibodies. Immunoreaction signals were visualized
by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system
(PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Waltham MA).

Soluble VEGFR-3 (sVEGFR-3) (250 ng/mL) (AngioProteomie, Boston, MA) was immobilized on 96-well plates
and blocked with phosphate buffer containing 1% BSA for
1 hour at room temperature. In competition experiments,
peptides were incubated with the VEGFR-3-coated plates
for 6 hours at room temperature. After incubation, human
recombinant VEGF-C protein (rhVEGF-C, 300 ng/mL,
100 μL) was added directly to the wells without removal
of the peptides and then incubated at room temperature
for 6 hours. The plates were thoroughly washed with
0.1% BSA/PBS buffer (pH 8.5), and anti–VEGF-C Ab
was added at 4°C for 24 hours. Biotin-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit IgG antibody was added for 1 hour. HRPconjugated streptavidin was then added for 30 minutes. The
free streptavidin conjugate was washed away and freshly
prepared substrate solution (TMB) was then added to each
well. The reaction was allowed to stand for 15 minutes,
and the color development was stopped by the addition of
H3PO4 (1.0 mol/L). The absorbance at 450 nm was read
with a reference wavelength of 650 nm (A450/650).

H928 lung cancer cells (2×105) were cultured in
24-well plates and serum-starved for 24 hours. Cells
were pretreated with candidate peptide for 30 minutes
and then treated with rhVEGF-C for 15 minutes. Cells
were solubilized in RIPA lysis buffer for 60 minutes.
Another 85 μl of cell lysate was transferred to an ELISA
well that was coated with VEGFR-3 and incubated for
2 hours. After the plates were washed, biotinylated-4G10
antibody (500 ng/ml, 100 μl) was added and incubated for
2 hours. After the plates were washed, HRP-conjugated
streptavidin was then added for 30 minutes. The free
avidin conjugate was washed away and freshly prepared
substrate solution (TMB) was then added to each well.
The reactions were allowed to proceed for 10 minutes,
and the color development was stopped by the addition of
H3PO4 (1.0 mol/L). The absorbance at 450 nm was read
with a reference wavelength of 650 nm (A450/650).

Cell migration/invasion assay
Boyden chamber cell migration assays were
performed using uncoated transwells and matrigelcoated transwells with membranes (8 μm pore-size)
(Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). The chambers
were inserted into 24-well culture plates that contained
DMEM/F12 with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were
pretreated with peptide (100 μM) in serum-free DMEM/
F12 medium and were loaded into the transwells. After
24 hours, non-migrated cells were removed with a cotton
swab and the cells were fixed with methanol for 15 min
and stained with crystal violet. The migrated cells were

VEGFR-3-Kinase Assay
Kinase assays were performed as previously
described [32]. Briefly, human soluble protein kinase
VEGFR-3 (sVEGFR-3) that was expressed in insect cells
was used for the kinase assays. The candidate peptides
were preincubated with 0.1 μg/ml of enzyme in modified
HEPES buffer pH 7.4 for 15 minutes at 37°C. The reaction
was initiated by addition of 0.2 mg/ml poly(Glu:Tyr),
10 μM ATP and 0.25 μCi [γ32P]ATP for another 30 minute
incubation period and terminated by further addition

lower surface of the membrane from at least 10 fields per
chamber using a 20X objective. All migration and invasion
assays were normalized to the proliferation rate.

(Thermo Scientific, Brookfield, WI). The specific primers
for SOX2 were 5'-TACAACATGATGGAGACG-3' and
5'-GCGTGTACTTATCCTTCTTC-3'. The reaction was
cycled at 95°C for 40 seconds, then 56°C for 40 seconds,
and then 72°C for 30 seconds for 30 cycles followed by a
final extension of 72°C for 5 minutes.

Cell death by DNA flow cytometric assay
Briefly, cells were treated with 20 nM Taxol or
10μM cisplatin and incubated for 48 hours. Samples were
prepared and analyzed as previously described [33].

Animal Protocols
All animal work was performed in accordance with
protocols that were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the National Health Research
Institutes. All of the animal experiments were performed on
6- to 8-week-old CB-17 severe combined immunodeficient
(SCID) female mice (supplied by LASCO, Taiwan) with
eight animals per group. The control (P4), P5 and P6
peptides were pretreated with 8 μg/g body weight dissolved
in 50 μl PBS and i.v. injected into mice one day before
cancer cell injection. For experimental metastasis assays,
2.5 × 105 viable cells were resuspended in 0.1 mL of PBS
and introduced into the circulation via tail vein injection.
For the treatment, peptides were administered (8 μg/g body
weight) twice weekly for 8 weeks. The luciferase-based,
non-invasive bioluminescent imaging and analysis were
performed with the Xenogen IVIS-200 system (Xenogen,
Alameda, CA, USA).

Cell viability evaluation by trypan blue dye
exclusion assay
Briefly, cells were harvested using trypsin and
stained with 0.4% trypan blue dye (Sigma-Aldrich). Trypan
blue-positive and -negative cells were counted using a
hemacytometer (Hausser Scientific, Horsham, PA) under
a phase-contrast microscope (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh,
PA). The results of each assay were expressed in terms of
the percentage of dead cells relative to the total number of
cells. Individual experiments were performed in triplicate.

Cell viability by MTT assay
A549 lung cancer cells (3×103) were cultured in
96-well plates and serum-starved for 24 hours. Cells were
treated with the candidate peptides (200 μM) for 4 hours
and were treated with rhVEGF-C (100 ng/mL) for 6 hours
in serum-free medium. After 48 hours, MTT (5 mg/ml)
was added for 3 hours and the precipitates were dissolved
in DMSO. The absorbance at 570 nm was read with a
reference wavelength of 630 nm (A570/630).

Sphere-forming assay
A549 and MCF-7 cells were serum-starved for
24 hours. The cells were pretreated with candidate
peptides (200 μM) in the presence or absence of
rhVEGF-C for 24 hours. The cells were trypsinized and
mechanically dissociated to generate single cells that were
then seeded at a density of 1×103 cells/ml in serum-free
DMEM/F12 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) that
was freshly supplemented with epidermal growth factor
(20  ng/ml), basic fibroblast growth factor (20 ng/ml)
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), 1X B27 supplement,
1X N2 supplement (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in
the presence or absence of rhVEGF-C (200 ng/mL)
and candidate peptides (200 μM) in non-adherent plates
for 10  days. Quantification of sphere formation was
determined by measuring the percentage of 5000 spheres.
