BACKGROUND: Mutations in the tumor protein 53 (TP53) tumor suppressor gene are common in head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and correlate with radioresistance. Currently, there are no clinically available therapeutic approaches targeting p53 in HNSCC. In this report, the authors propose a strategy that uses TP53 mutational
status to individualize antimetabolic strategies for the potentiation of radiation toxicity in HNSCC cells. METHODS:
Glycolytic flux and mitochondrial respiration were evaluated in wild-type (wt) and mutant (mut) TP53 HNSCC cell
lines. Sensitivity to external-beam radiation (XRT) was measured using a clonogenic assay. RESULTS: HNSCC cells
that expressed mutTP53 demonstrated radioresistance compared with HNSCC cells that expressed wtTP53. Glycolytic inhibition potentiated radiation toxicity in mutTP53-expressing, but not wtTP53-expressing, HNSCC cells. The relative sensitivity of mutTP53 HNSCC cells to glycolytic inhibition was caused by a glycolytic dependence associated
with decreased mitochondrial complex II and IV activity. The wtTP53-expressing cells maintained mitochondrial
reserves and were relatively insensitive to glycolytic inhibition. Inhibition of respiration using metformin increased glycolytic dependence in wtTP53-expressing cells and potentiated the effects of glycolyic inhibition on radiation toxicity.
CONCLUSIONS: TP53 mutation in HNSCC cells was correlated with a metabolic shift away from mitochondrial respiration toward glycolysis, resulting in increased sensitivity to the potentiating effects of glycolytic inhibition on radiation toxicity. In contrast, wtTP53-expressing cells required inhibition of both mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis
to become sensitized to radiation. Therefore, the authors concluded that TP53 mutational status may be used as a
marker of altered tumor cell metabolism to individualize HNSCC treatment selection of specific, targeted metabolic

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with over

40,000 new cases per year.1 Despite advances in diagnostic modalities, a significant number of patients present with
advanced disease and require multimodality treatment combining surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy and externalbeam radiation (XRT).2 Mutations in tumor protein 53 (TP53) have been correlated with aggressive HNSCC disease and
relative radioresistance.3,4 Because of toxicity concerns, dose escalation often is not a viable option for patients who present
with TP53 mutations. Therefore, it is imperative to identify novel radiosensitizing approaches for patients with relatively
radioresistant, mutant TP53 (mutTP53) HNSCC.

Original Article

The role of p53 in tumor biology is complex, spanning effects on cell proliferation, death, and response to exogenous stress.5 Loss of p53 function through missense
mutation can disrupt cell cycle arrest and death in response
to DNA damage, resulting in resistance to cytotoxic treatments.6 It has been demonstrated that p53 plays a role in
metabolic homeostasis by balancing glycolytic activity and
mitochondrial respiration. Loss of wild-type p53 (wtp53)
function through deletion or mutation results in an unbalanced metabolic phenotype in which glycolytic activity predominates at the expense of adequate mitochondrial
function.7-11 We suggest that this phenomenon represents a
unique therapeutic opportunity to address mutTP53driven disease. Tumor cells that maintain a diversified metabolic profile are less likely to die from targeted inhibition
of specific metabolic pathways. Conversely, tumor cells that
become exclusively dependent on a single metabolic pathway through loss of wtp53 function may display increased
susceptibility to targeted metabolic agents.
Impaired mitochondrial function has been described
in HNSCC samples and shown to correlate with adverse
clinical outcomes.12-16 We previously demonstrated that
HNSCC cells predominantly catabolize glucose, resulting
in a generalized sensitivity to glycolytic inhibition. This sensitivity increased dramatically after loss of p53 function.17
On the basis of these data, we hypothesized that TP53 status could be used to select antimetabolic strategies aimed at
sensitizing HNSCC cells to XRT toxicity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals
2-Deoxyglucose, metformin, oligomycin, rotenone, antimycin A, N-acetyl cysteine, and carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo). D-glucose was
purchased from ICN Biomedical (Irvine, Calif).
Cells
The HNSCC cell lines used in this study were authenticated by short tandem-repeat profiling and were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium that
contained fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin,
glutamine, sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids,
and vitamins. Stable knock-downs of wtTP53 (HN30)
and mutTP53 (HN31) have been described previously.17
Expression Array Analysis
Total RNA was isolated with Tri Reagent (SigmaAldrich). Total RNA (100 ng) was analyzed with the Illu-

712

mina Whole Genome annealing, selection, extension, and
ligation (DASL) Assay (Illumina, San Diego, Calif);
hybridized to the HumanRef-8 v3 beadchip (Illumina);
and read on the Illumina BeadArray Reader. Raw data
exported from the Illumina BeadStudio software package
were background corrected, log transformed, and quantile
normalized in R (R Project for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria). Batch effects were removed by fitting
linear models for each gene. Class comparisons were performed using BRB Array Tools developed by Dr. Richard
Simon and the BRB-ArrayTools Development Team
(Biometrics Research Branch, National Cancer Institute,
Bethesda, Md).
Metabolic Studies
The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were assayed under basal
conditions (25 mM D-glucose, 1 mM pyruvate, 4 mM
glutamine, 0% serum) after the administration of various
drugs using a Seahorse Bioscience XF24 Extracellular
Flux Analyzer (Billerica, Mass), as described previously.18
Electron transport chain activity was assayed at 30 C
using a temperature-controlled spectrophotometer (Infinite 200; Tecan Systems Inc., Mannedorf, Switzerland).
The activities of complex I (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [NADH] dehydrogenase), complex II (succinate
dehydrogenase), total and rotenone sensitive complex I þ
III (NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome C oxidoreductase), complex II þ III (succinate dehydrogenase and
cytochrome C oxidoreductase), complex III (cytochrome
C reductase), complex IV (cytochrome C oxidase), and citrate synthase (CS) were measured using appropriate electron acceptors/donors. The increase or decrease in the
absorbance of cytochrome C at 550 nm was measured for
complex I þ III, complex II þ III, complex III, and complex IV. The activity of complex I was measured by oxidation of NADH at 340 nm. For complex II, the reduction
of 2,6-dichloroindophenol at 600 nm was measured.
Decylubiquinone, a more hydrophilic component, was
used in place of ubiquinone (or coenzyme Q10).19 CS was
assayed by measuring the rate of production coenzyme A
from oxaloacetate using Ellman reagent (5,50 -dithiobis[2-nitrobenzoic acid]). Enzyme activities were expressed
as nmol per minute per mg protein.19,20
Clonogenic Assay
HNSCC cells were irradiated using a high-dose-rate
137
Cs unit (4.5 gray per minute) to the indicated dose.
Cells were incubated for 10 to 14 days to allow for visible

colony development and then were fixed and stained
using a 1% formalin/crystal violet solution. Colonies were
counted and surviving fractions were determined based
on the plating efficiency of the nonirradiated control
group.
Reactive Oxygen Species Measurement
Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were
measured with 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-20 ,70 -dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA)
using a combination of 96-well spectrophotometric
analysis and flow cytometry, as described previously.21
Briefly, cells were loaded with dye for 30 to 60 minutes,
the excess dye was removed, and these cells were incubated
with various drugs before exposure to XRT. Fluorescence
was normalized to the control condition and cell number
as assayed by total DNA.22

RESULTS
Glycolytic Inhibition Potentiates Radiation
Toxicity in HNSCC Cell Lines Expressing
Mutant but Not Wild-Type TP53
By using an isogenic cell line pair divergent for TP53
mutational status, we demonstrated radioresistance associated with mutTP53 (HN31) cells compared with their
wild-type counterparts (HN30 cells) (Fig. 1A). These
results have been confirmed in a series of parallel studies
performed on multiple HNSCC cell lines (data not
shown). We previously reported that HN31 cells display
increased glycolytic dependence compared with their
HN30 counterparts.17 On the basis of those initial observations regarding differential radiosensitivity and metabolic profile, we set out to evaluate the ability of
metabolic targeting to potentiate the effects of radiation
in mutTP53-expressing HNSCC cell lines.
Treatment of HN31 cells with 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) resulted in significant potentiation of radiation toxicity at multiple radiation doses; in contrast, 2-DG failed
to induce significant potentiation of radiation toxicity in
HN30 cells (wtp53) (Fig. 1A). To determine whether this
effect was unique to the TP53 mutations expressed by
HN31 cells, we extended our analysis to 2 other cell lines
with TP53 missense mutations that stabilize the p53 protein (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Treatment with 2-DG
significantly decreased the surviving fraction at 2 gray
(SF2) in all 3 mutTP53-expressing cell lines, but not in
HN30 cells. Consistent effects across 3 cells lines that
express different TP53 mutations suggest that this

phenomenon is caused by the loss of wtTP53 function as
opposed to a specific gain of function for a particular
mutation. To further demonstrate this, we used a previously described, stable short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)
knockdown of wtTP53 in HN30 cells. Figure 1C indicates that stable knockdown of wtTP53 led to decreased
transcriptional activity, as demonstrated by decreased p21

activation in HN30 cells, which resulted in increased sensitivity to the potentiation of radiation toxicity by 2-DG.
2-DG Effects on Radiation Toxicity Are Driven
by Changes in Intracellular ROS Levels
The effects of 2-DG on tumor cells are complex and may
depend on tumor type.23 Here, we sought to determine
whether the effects of 2-DG on radiation toxicity are
mediated through intracellular ROS by measuring ROS
levels using CM-H2DCFDA.21 XRT increased intracellular ROS in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown).
This effect was potentiated by the addition of 2-DG and
was reversed by the free-radical scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (Fig. 2). The potentiation of XRT-driven intracellular
ROS levels by 2-DG was time-dependent (with respect to
the length of 2-DG exposure), suggesting that the relative
effectiveness of antiglycolytic strategies in the context of
conventional treatment will depend on the timing and

714

manner of administration (Fig. 2C). Reversal of increased
ROS using N-acetyl cysteine resulted in abrogation of the
effects of 2-DG (Fig. 2C,D).
TP53 Mutation Is Not Associated With
Differential Expression of Glucose
Transporters or Glycolytic Enzymes
TP53 is an important regulator of cellular metabolic homeostasis. After loss of p53 function through deletion or
mutation, a cell’s metabolism shifts away from mitochondrial respiration toward glycolysis.7 Our analysis of
HNSCC cell lines suggests that mutation of TP53 does
not result in increased glycolytic activity under baseline
conditions. We observed that glucose transporter 1
expression was similar across cell lines that expressed
wtTP53 or mutTP53 (Fig. 3A). A more detailed gene
array analysis of glucose transporter and glycolytic enzyme
expression indicated that there were no differences in

of glycolytic and mitochondrial activity (Fig. 4A). MCF-7
cells display robust mitochondrial respiration, functioning at subcapacity levels. Loss of mitochondrial adenosine
triphosphate (ATP)-generating capacity results in glycolytic compensation and increased lactic acid production.
These data were reproduced in the wtTP53-expressing
HN30 cells, but not in the mutTP53-expressing HN31
cells (Fig. 4B). After uncoupling of the proton gradient
using FCCP, HN30 cells displayed significant reserve mitochondrial capacity, whereas HN31 cells functioned at
maximal capacity under both coupled and uncoupled
conditions. It is noteworthy that baseline mitochondrial
activity expressed as a function of the OCR was similar
between the 2 cell lines. Oligomycin, an inhibitor of the
mitochondrial ATP synthase (F0 subunit), triggered a robust increase in lactic acid production, expressed as a function of the ECAR in both MCF-7 and HN30 cells, but
triggered a much smaller increase in HN31 cells.
This analysis was extended to 3 other HNSCC cell lines
that exhibit point mutations in TP53 and protein stabilization (data not shown). Figure 4D indicates that all 4 cell
lines expressing mutp53 had substantially lower respiratory capacity under uncoupled conditions as well as
decreased glycolytic compensation after oligomycin
inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. These data suggest that the metabolic defect observed in the HN30HN31 isogenic cell pair may be indicative of a larger metabolic phenotype associated with mutTP53 across
HNSCC cell lines. Decreased mitochondrial capacity was
correlated with an increased susceptibility of mutTP53expressing HN31 cells to glycolytic inhibition by 2-DG
(Fig. 4C).
Existing literature differs with regard to the manner
in which loss of wtTP53 alters mitochondrial function.7,10,11 Gene array analysis of all nuclear encoded mitochondrial related genes (including SCO cytochrome
oxidase-deficient homolog 1 [SCO1] and SCO2) demonstrated no significant differences between wtTP53expressing and mutTP53-expressing HNSCC cells (data
not shown). Staining of HNSCC cells with chloromethylX-rosamine dye (MiotoTracker CMXRos; Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, Calif) demonstrated no difference in the
amount of mitochondria between cells that expressed
wtTP53 and mutTP53 (Fig. 5A). A more detailed in vitro
analysis of individual complex activity in HN30 and
HN31 cells demonstrated decreased activity for mitochondrial membrane enzyme complexes II, II þ III, and
IV with similar activity for complex I and complex I þ III
in the mutTP53-bearing HN31 cells. Citrate synthase

alterations observed (data not shown). An analysis of electron transport chain complex activity in HN30, HN31,
CAL27, and TR146 cells demonstrated that all 3
mutTP53-expressing HNSCC cell lines exhibited similar
decreases in complex II, II þ III, and IV activity compared

Starvation Activates Catabolic Mechanisms
but Not p53 Stabilization in HNSCC Cells
Previous studies have reported that glucose starvation or
treatment with metabolic inhibitors (2-DG, metformin)
can result in increased p53 protein levels.24,32 Starvation
or treatment of HN30 cells with 2-DG failed to stabilize
p53 levels in contrast to the elevation of p53 levels
observed after treatment with the known DNA-damaging
agent 5-fluorouracil (Fig. 7). It is noteworthy that both
starvation and 2-DG decreased p53 levels at longer time
points in both wtTP53-expressing and mutTP53-expressing HNSCC cells (Fig. 7 and data not shown). This may
represent a specific degradation phenomenon, or it simply
may indicate increased protein turnover caused by energetic depletion. Lack of p53 stabilization in HN30 cells in
response to metabolic stress also was confirmed using
reverse phosphoprotein analysis, which failed to detect
p53 phosphorylation at serine 15 in response to either glucose starvation or 2-DG treatment (data not shown). Glucose starvation and 2-DG inhibition of glycolysis
triggered increased phosphorylation of 50 adenosine
monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key
intracellular energy sensor. Phosphorylation of AMPK
was more pronounced in HN31 cells compared with
HN30 cells, correlating with their respective sensitivity to
glucose starvation. Activation of catabolic pathways in
both cell lines was demonstrated further by increased
cleavage of the autophagy marker LC-3b (Fig. 7).
Metformin Potentiates the Effects of 2-DG by
Impairing Mitochondrial Respiration in Both
Wild-Type and Mutant TP53 HNSCC
Metformin is a commonly used antidiabetic drug with
demonstrated activity against mitochondrial respiration.25 The results illustrated in Figure 8A,C indicate that
metformin reduced the OCR in HN30 cells to levels consistent with the complete absence of mitochondrial activity. Both acute and prolonged exposure resulted in a
compensatory increase in glycolytic activity (Fig. 8B,D).
Consistent with its effects on altering mitochondrial activity, the addition of metformin significantly potentiated
intracellular ROS levels in response to XRT (Fig. 8E). In

combination with 2-DG, metformin resulted in the
potentiation of XRT toxicity despite minimal single-agent
effects (Fig. 8F). Although, in combination with 2-DG,
metformin triggered the phosphorylation of AMPK, as a
single-agent, metformin did not induce increased phosphorylated AMPK levels (Fig. 7).

DISCUSSION
Tumor cell metabolism has received increased scrutiny
over the last 2 decades as investigators have sought out
new biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Although specific
alterations in tumor cell metabolism, such as single gene
(isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 [IDH1]/IDH2) mutations are
encountered only in a select number of solid tumors, generalized disruption of normal metabolic homeostasis may
occur to some degree in all solid tumors.26 Chief among
recorded metabolic perturbations is a shift away from mitochondrial respiration toward aerobic glycolysis.27
Although the precise sequence of events and driving forces
that push tumor cells toward this metabolic phenotype
remain in dispute, it is evident that multiple oncogenic
events can play key roles in this metabolic shift.28 One oncogenic event that contributes to this metabolic shift is

increased dependence on aerobic glycolysis. Here, we provide evidence for a therapeutic strategy designed to

clinically available treatment strategies designed to specifically address mutTP53 disease and the associated radioresistance. Here, we propose a therapeutic approach that
uses TP53 status to improve the therapeutic efficacy of
specific antimetabolic strategies.
Our previous analysis of HNSCC cell lines revealed
a generalized sensitivity to antiglycolytic agents, although
significant heterogeneity was observed in the relative
response of HNSCC cell lines.17 Because relative resistance and sensitivity can be driven by changes in the functionality of a single transporter or enzyme, we chose 2 cell
lines derived from the same patient with an isogenic background. Our initial analysis demonstrated that HNSCC
cells expressing wtTP53 possess improved resistance to
glucose withdrawal and relative resistance to 2-DG.17 In
the current study, we have demonstrated a difference in
mitochondrial respiratory capacity between these 2 isogenic HNSCC cell lines that depends on TP53 status.
Specifically, although baseline respiration appears to be
similar, the reserve mitochondrial capacity of HNSCC
cells expressing mutTP53 is diminished, suggesting that,
under baseline conditions, they function at maximal mitochondrial capacity. This is in stark contrast with
HNSCC cells that express wtTP53, which possess significant reserve respiratory capacity. It is noteworthy that the
glycolytic compensation of HNSCC cells without
wtTP53 also was blunted in the acute setting, suggesting a
globalized loss of metabolic flexibility because of the maximal use of available pathways. It is important to note that
these effects were measured under baseline conditions and
did not take into account potential adaptation through
the up-regulation of glucose transporters or glycolytic
enzymes that may take place during chronic conditions
of metabolic stress. The relative sensitivity to 2-DG
inhibition of glycolytic flux previously described was
further validated in real time, suggesting increased
reliance on glycolytic flux among HNSCC cells without
functional p53.
The discussed TP53-driven metabolic differences
are important for 2 reasons. First, they suggest that TP53driven metabolic perturbations may play an important
role in HNSCC pathogenesis. Second, they point to an
opportunity for antimetabolic strategies tailored to the
underlying metabolic phenotype. Therefore, we investigated the potential of metformin to potentiate the cytotoxic effects of radiation in HNSCC cell lines. Although
more specific mitochondrial inhibitors, such as rotenone
and cyanide, are available, their generalized toxicity makes

720

them unlikely therapeutic options. It has been demonstrated that metformin, a commonly used antidiabetic
drug, inhibits respiration and potentiates the effects of 2DG.25,31,32 Here, we demonstrate that acute exposure to
metformin can abrogate mitochondrial respiration,
increase intracellular ROS in response to 2-DG and XRT,
and potentiate the toxicity of XRT in combination with
2-DG. This is an important proof of principle that, in
cells maintaining high rates of both glycolytic activity and
robust respiration, a dual-targeted antimetabolic strategy
can be effective in potentiating radiation toxicity. The
effects of metformin on intracellular ROS and radiation
toxicity are particularly intriguing insofar as they may represent a novel explanation for TP53-driven radiosensitivity in HNSCC. It has been demonstrated that altered
mitochondrial respiration has an impact on sensitivity to
XRT through changes in intracellular ROS.33-35 It is possible that the relative radiosensitivity and resistance
observed among HNSCC cell lines may be driven at least
in part by differential mitochondrial activity. Decreased
mitochondrial activity and increased dependence on aerobic glycolysis suggests that, in the setting of mutTP53,
HNSCC cells may be particularly susceptible to the effects
of antiglycolytic agents like 2-DG on the intracellular
energy state and ROS generation.
Therapeutic strategies generally are predicated on a
significant therapeutic index of the chosen agent or combination of agents. Although antimetabolic strategies have
demonstrated significant potential in the preclinical setting, clinical results have been disappointing. Targeted
agents like 2-DG, which has been under investigation for
nearly half a century, have not demonstrated a consistent
response in solid tumors even when combined with conventional treatment.36,37 One possible explanation for
this phenomenon is the lack of available predictors to
define patient populations for existing and developing
drugs. We suggest that, in HNSCC tumors that do not
express wtTP53, glycolytic inhibition could result in significant radiosensitization, favorably impacting as much
as 40% to 60% of HNSCC tumors. HNSCC cells that
express wtTP53 are likely to be resistant to this approach.
Therefore, in these cells, the addition of mitochondrial inhibition using metformin may provide an appropriate alternative approach. The effectiveness of these strategies
will require extensive testing in a preclinical in vivo model
to further validate these in vitro results. Nevertheless, we
suggest a novel approach to the treatment of HNSCC
that takes into account TP53 mutational status in determining a choice of radiosensitizing antimetabolic agents.
