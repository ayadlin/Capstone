ABSTRACT
The AXL receptor tyrosine kinase and its major ligand, GAS6 have been
demonstrated to be overexpressed and activated in many human cancers (such as
lung, breast, and pancreatic cancer) and have been correlated with poor prognosis,
promotion of increased invasiveness/metastasis, the EMT phenotype and drug
resistance. Targeting AXL in different model systems with specific small molecule
kinase inhibitors or antibodies alone or in combination with other drugs can lead
to inactivation of AXL-mediated signaling pathways and can lead to regained drug
sensitivity and improved therapeutic efficacy, defining AXL as a promising novel target
for cancer therapeutics. This review highlights the data supporting AXL as a novel
treatment candidate in a variety of cancers as well as the current status of drug
development targeting the AXL/GAS6 axis and future perspectives in this emerging
field.

Introduction to the TAM tyrosine kinase
receptor family

on chromosome 19q13.2 and encodes 20 exons [5]. The
MER and TYRO-3 genes are located on chromosome
2q 14.1 and chromosome 15q15, respectively. The
TAM family is characterized by a combination of two
immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains and dual fibronectin
type III (FNIII) repeat domains in the extracellular region,
a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tyrosine
kinase domain (Figure 1A) [2, 6].

The tyrosine kinase family of proteins is composed
of two major groups, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)
and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs). RTKs are
well known to be involved in tumorigenesis and many
of these serve as actionable targets for cancer therapy.
The TAM group of RTKs is a recently identified class of
the RTK subfamily that transduces crucial extracellular
signals to the inside of the cell [1]. The small family of
TAM receptor kinases include TYRO-3 (also known
as Brt, Dtk, Rse, Sky and Tif), AXL (also known as
Ark, Tyro7 and Ufo), and MER (also known as Eyk,
Nym and Tyro12) [2, 3]. The transforming gene, AXL
(derived from the Greek word “anexelekto”, meaning
uncontrolled) was originally isolated from chronic
myelogenous leukemia cells [4]. The AXL gene is located

AXL ligands
The TAM family kinases were initially considered
to be orphan receptors [4, 7] but now it is understood
that there are diverse ligands for this family of receptors.
Growth arrest specific gene 6 (Gas6), protein S, Tubby,
Tubby-like protein 1 (Tulp-1) and Galectin-3 are known
ligands for TAM family members. Gas6 and protein S
are members of the vitamin K-dependent protein family

[8–10]. Gas6 cDNA shows significant homology to protein
S [9, 11] and both are secreted proteins and mediate their
action through binding to and activating AXL, Tyro3 and
Mer [12]. Gas6 and protein S have different receptorbinding specificity. Gas6 binds to all three TAM RTKs
(AXL>TYRO-3>MER), whereas protein S interacts only
with MER and TYRO-3 but not AXL [13–17]. Gas6 has
3- to 10-fold higher affinity for AXL than MER. In addition,
several reports suggest that Tubby, Tulp-1 and Galectin -3
are also novel ligands for TAM receptors. Similar to Gas6
and protein S, tubby and tulp-1 have distinct binding

specificities to TAM RTKs. Tulp-1 bind to all three RTKs,
whereas Tubby only recognizes MER [18, 19].

AXL signaling: activation and regulation
AXL can be activated through a number of
different mechanisms: ligand-dependent dimerization
(principally driven by Gas-6), ligand-independent
dimerization, interaction between two monomers
on neighboring cells and heteromeric dimerization
with a non-TAM receptor (Figure 1B) [3, 12, 13, 20].

and dual fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeat domains and a kinase domain. Gas6 contains a γ-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain, a loop
region, four EGF-like repeats and two C-terminal globular laminin G-like (LG) domains. (B) AXL can be activated by ligand-dependent
dimerization, ligand-independent dimerization, and interaction between two monomers on neighboring cells and heteromeric dimerization

Gas6-mediated AXL dimerization is likely to occur in
two steps, with a high-affinity 1:1 Gas6/AXL complex
forming first, then lateral diffusion of such complexes
leading to the formation of a dimeric signaling
complex [6]. Gas6 binding to the extracellular domain
of AXL leads to autophosphorylation of tyrosine
residues on the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of
AXL, including Y779, Y821, Y866 (Figure 1C) [21].
Gas6/AXL signaling plays diverse roles in numerous
cellular activities [22]. These effects are mainly
mediated by Gas6/AXL-induced activation of MAPK/
ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. C1-TEN and
SOCS-1 have been identified as negative regulators of
AXL signaling. In particular, C1-TEN can negatively
regulate AXL-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling and
thereby reduces cell survival, proliferation, and
migration of HEK293 cells (Figure 1C) [23, 24]. In
murine and human plasma, soluble forms of AXL
(sAXL) are produced by proteolytic cleavage and sAXL
binds to Gas6 thereby inhibiting cellular activation of
AXL [25].

sites within specific Sp1 motifs of the promoter can also
modulate AXL gene expression [36]. Myeloid zinc finger
1 (MZF1), a SCAN domain family transcription factor,
can also bind to the AXL promoter and transactivate its
expression [37]. In addition, specific miRs (microRNAs)
that target the 3’-UTR of the AXL gene have been identified
in several cancer cell lines. AXL receptor expression can
specifically be regulated by miR-34a and miR-199a/b,
which are suppressed by promoter methylation in a number
of solid tumors (such as non-small cell lung cancer, breast
cancer, colorectal cancer) [38].

AXL overexpression in lung cancer
Overexpression of AXL has been observed in
approximately 60% of NSCLC cell lines, and AXL is
also highly expressed in a significant fraction of primary
lung cancers [40, 74]. It has been shown that in the H1299
lung cancer cell line expressing different mutant forms of
p53, AXL is upregulated upon p53 loss and at least in part
gain-of-function activities of mutant p53 were mediated
through AXL overexpression as knockdown of AXL by
AXL-specific siRNA reduced cell growth and motility
[75]. Rac1 has been identified as a downstream effector
of AXL via the PI3K/AKT pathway promoting reactive
oxygen species (ROS) production and cell migration.
Excessive ROS may in turn lead to AXL phosphorylation
and Akt1 and Rac1 activation may play important
roles in cell migration under oxidative stress[76].
Depletion of Rac1 in NSCLC cells was found to result
in decreased anticancer drug resistance and inhibited
rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton that attenuated
cell migration [77, 78]. Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1)
is a nuclear effector of the Hippo pathway that plays an
important role in tumorigenesis and progression in lung
adenocarcinomas. Compared to normal lung tissue, YAP1
was shown overexpressed in lung adenocarcinomas,
and knockdown of YAP1 markedly downregulated the
expression of AXL and inhibited the proliferation and
invasion of lung adenocarcinomas suggesting that AXL is
a mediator of the oncogenic function of YAP1 [79].

Physiological roles of TAM receptors
The TAM family of RTKs regulates an intriguing
mix of physiological processes, including cell
proliferation, survival, cell adhesion and migration, blood
clot stabilization, and regulation of inflammatory cytokine
release. Although expression of TAM receptor mRNAs is
observed in embryonic tissues [26–28], single, double, and
even triple knockouts are viable without any obvious signs
of developmental defects at birth [29–31], suggesting that
the TAM RTKs are nonessential for embryogenesis[32].
Conversely, adult TAM knockout mice develop diverse
phenotypes in a wide range of tissues revealing prominent
cellular functions for TAM receptors. In adult tissues,
TYRO-3, AXL, and MER exhibit widespread distribution
with overlapping but unique expression profiles. In adult
tissues, AXL is expressed ubiquitously[4], with high
levels found in hippocampus and cerebellum, platelets,
monocytes/macrophages, endothelial cells, skeletal
muscle, heart, kidney, testes, liver, as well as in different
cell lines of mesenchymal, epithelial and hematopoietic
origin [10, 33–35].

AXL in breast cancer
AXL is overexpressed in highly invasive
breast cancer cell lines (such as Hs578T, BT549,
MDA-MB-435s, MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-436, and
MDA-MB-231); in contrast, weakly invasive breast cancer
cell lines do not or only weakly express AXL. It has also
been demonstrated that AXL expression correlates with
motility and invasiveness in breast cancer cells [42]. The
miR-34a/AXL interaction was functionally characterized
through ectopic overexpression experiments with a
miR-34a mimic in two independent triple-negative
breast cancer cell lines. MiR-34a was found to bind to
its putative target site within the AXL 3′-UTR to regulate

AXL expression in cancer
AXL has been reported to be overexpressed or
ectopically expressed in a multitude of cancers (Table 1).
While overexpression in general is defined as expression
higher than normal tissue counterparts, it needs to be
highlighted that the listed manuscripts vary greatly in their
approach as to this definition and there is a need for the
development of a validated, reliable assay to measure AXL
expression. AXL gene expression is regulated by Sp1/
Sp3 transcription factors. In addition, methylation of CpG

AXL expression and impair its functions [38, 80]. Studies
suggest that the estrogen receptor can induce AXL
expression and this interaction could play an important
role in the proliferation, differentiation and apoptotic
cell death in human breast epithelium [81]. Gas6 has
been demonstrated to be upregulated more than 20-fold
through the progesterone receptor B (PRB) [82], and
Her-2 is also reported to trigger AXL activation, suggesting
crosstalk with this clinically important pathway [83].
Tazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) is highly expressed
in inflammatory breast cancer, promoting tumor growth
and invasion. It appears that TIG1 physically associates
with and stabilizes AXL protein in vivo by inhibiting its
proteasomal degradation. These data also strongly suggest
that AXL might be an important therapeutic target in
inflammatory breast cancer [43].

AXL inhibition with the small molecule inhibitor, BGB324
is able to overcome this mechanism and can synergize with
chemotherapy. In this study, 57% of AML patient samples
showed AXL expression and overall outcome in this subset
was worse. 90% of samples showed Gas6 expression,
however further analysis showed that this expression was
predominantly related to stromal expression [44].

AXL in AML

AXL as a potential oncogenic gene involved
in EMT and metastasis/invasion

AXL in prostate and pancreatic cancer
Increased AXL expression was demonstrated
to promote migration and invasion of prostate cancer
cells in vitro [56, 57, 84], and is also associated
with a higher frequency of distant metastasis after
pancreaticoduodenectomy in patients with pancreatic
adenocarcinoma [59, 60, 85].

AXL was found to be an independent prognostic
marker and therapeutic target in acute myeloid leukemia
(AML). It appears that AML cells can induce expression
and secretion of Gas6 from bone marrow derived stromal
cells and Gas6 in turn mediates proliferation, survival
and chemoresistance of AXL expressing AML cells. This
paracrine axis creates a chemoprotective tumor cell niche.

AXL and drug resistance

to the invasive and metastatic properties of carcinomas
[86, 87]. In a number of cancers, development of acquired
resistance correlates with EMT traits, such as metastatic
potential, invasiveness and mesenchymal-like traits. For
example, our group was the first to demonstrate that
EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC cells not only gained AXL
upregulation, but also demonstrated a concomitant EMT
phenotype [41]. Other recent studies also showed that
AXL expression was associated with EMT and therapeutic
resistance may be associated with histological changes
[88, 89]. EMT-associated up-regulation of AXL can drive
autocrine interactions with Gas6 produced by endothelial
cells, suggesting that autocrine AXL signaling might be
a frequent consequence of EMT in many tumor types
[90, 91]. Further cell line models have demonstrated that
AXL mRNA is induced in HCC4006, HCC2279, H1650,
and H1975 cells following the development of acquired
resistance to EGFR-specific TKIs and this was again noted
to be associated with an EMT program switch [92, 93].
Furthermore, two studies show that AXL is activated in
breast cancer stem cells (BCSC) and AXL expression
induces EMT through direct regulation of the expression
of E- cadherin, N-cadherin, Slug and Snail. AXL-driven
EMT induction regulates BCSC invasion, migration
and chemoresistance. Treatment with the AXL inhibitor
MP470 (Amuvatinib) reversed EMT and thereby reduced
tumor growth, downregulated NF-kB pathway activity and
led to restoration of chemosensitivity in murine BCSCs
and mesenchymal normal human mammary epithelial
cells [94, 95].
In order to reveal the actual mechanisms underlying
the association of AXL and EMT, many factors related
to EMT have been explored. For example, vimentin
expression was shown to be required for the induction
of AXL expression and such regulation functionally
contributed to the EMT phenotype in breast cancer cells
and accordingly silencing of vimentin decreased AXL
levels significantly [89]. MZF1 was demonstrated to bind
to the AXL promoter and induced invasion and metastasis
in colorectal and cervical cancer cells, at least in part by
regulating AXL gene expression [37]. TAZWW domain
containing transcription regulator 1(TAZ) promotes EMTmediated cancer progression [96–98] and TAZ-AXLCTGF overexpression was associated with increased
expression of genes that were associated with colon cancer
progression, potentially serving as a novel prognostic
indicator for colon cancer progression [99]. Recently, AXL
has been demonstrated as a key regulator of inherent and
chemotherapy-induced invasion in invasive or migratory
CRC cell subpopulations with an EMT-like phenotype and
increased AXL levels predict a poor clinical outcome in
early stage colon cancer[100]. The important role of AXL
in EMT might seem contradictory in face of the lack of an
embryonic phenotype and this might possibly be explained
by compensatory mechanisms that might specifically exist
in embryonic tissues.

Several studies suggest that overexpression of
AXL may result in resistance to both targeted therapies
and conventional chemotherapy in different models,
such as lung cancer [41], breast cancer [101], esophageal
carcinoma [49], gastrointestinal stromal tumors [102],
and AML [103]. In our recent study, we independently
established new cellular models of acquired resistance
to the EGFR TKI erlotinib in EGFR-mutated lung
adenocarcinoma by using the erlotinib-sensitive, EGFRmutated NSCLC cell line HCC827, and revealed that
increased activation of AXL and induction of an EMT-like
state was associated with acquired resistance to erlotinib
in vitro and in vivo, identifying AXL as a promising
therapeutic target to prevent or overcome resistance. AXL
inhibition via AXL knockdown studies or through the
use of AXL tyrosine kinase inhibitors was able to reverse
acquired resistance and 20% of primary tumor samples
demonstrated significant upregulation of AXL upon the
development of in vivo resistance as compared to pretreatment samples [41, 104]. Another study looked at
a uniform group of 26 patients from one referral center
in Korea for mechanisms of acquired resistance and
similarly found a 19% frequency of AXL overexpression
upon acquired resistance to gefitinib (5/26). In one of
these patients the tumor also harbored an EGFR-T790M
resistance mutation [105]. More recently, a novel MET and
AXL inhibitor NPS-1034 was reported to exert efficacy
against NSCLC cells resistant to EGFR-TKIs due to MET
or AXL activation [106]. While the mechanism of AXL
overexpression upon acquired resistance remains unclear
in vivo, one study suggests that hypomethylation of the
AXL promoter may play a role in AXL overexpression
in ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells upon acquisition of
resistance to the ErbB2 inhibitor, lapatinib. In addition, the
multikinase inhibitor GSK1363089 that also targets AXL
can restore lapatinib sensitivity in HER2-positive breast
cancer cells that overexpress AXL [101]. Analogous to our
findings with erlotinib resistance, at least in vitro crizotinib
resistance in ALK-translocation positive lung cancer
models also appears to be mediated by an EMT transition
accompanied by AXL overexpression. However, in this
model AXL inhibition could not overcome resistance to
crizotinib but cellular migration and invasion were both
reduced [107]. Furthermore, AXL and its ligand Gas6
were similarly observed to be upregulated along with
vimentin upregulation and E-cadherin loss in the COR
cell clones resistant to the EGFR T790M-targeting drug,
CO-1686 in EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma [108].
Further corroborating data suggesting the importance of
AXL as a resistance marker came from a recent study
[93] that identified a 76 gene expression signature of
EMT that can classify NSCLCs either as epithelial or
mesenchymal. This signature with AXL expression as its
prime marker was found to be a biomarker of response

to targeted therapies, such as erlotinib or PI3kinase
inhibitor therapy. Pharmacological inhibition of AXL
in some of the models demonstrated synergistic effects
with erlotinib. This was then clinically validated by using
samples from the so-called BATTLE study. These data
suggest that AXL inhibition might enhance responses to
erlotinib in some NSCLC patients with wild-type EGFR
as well. Prospective clinical studies incorporating AXL
expression as a predictive biomarker of drug response and
a novel therapeutic target are warranted. These data also
suggest that inhibiting AXL signaling in NSCLC with a
mesenchymal phenotype might have therapeutic value.
Recently, expression of AXL has been identified as a
predictor for lack of response to EGFR–targeted inhibitors
in triple-negative breast cancer cells[109]. In this very
interesting study a unique machine learning analysis of
the CCLE database was performed and elevated AXL
gene expression was found to be exceptionally predictive
of lack of response to ErbB family inhibitors, such as
lapatinib and erlotinib. It was also found that EGFR
signaling transactivates AXL and this ligand-independent
AXL activity could then diversify downstream signaling
pathways beyond those triggered by EGFR alone.
Co-IP studies also showed that AXL physically associates
with EGFR, other ErbB members as well as MET and
PDGFR. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell
lines that overexpress both EGFR and AXL appear to
be more sensitive to AXL than EGFR inhibition. This
is particularly relevant as TBNs are known to have high
expression of EGFR; still EGFR inhibitors have not
demonstrated sufficient activity by themselves in this
highly aggressive histotype. Interestingly, combined
inhibition of EGFR and AXL was subadditive and this
might be explained by the fact that they utilize shared
downstream pathway components[95]. Indeed, activation
of EGFR by EGF stimulation of MDA-MB-231 cells
led to both MET and AXL phosphorylation but not vice
versa. EGFR-mediated AXL activation led to widespread
downstream signaling changes blocked by AXL siRNA,
while Gas6 stimulation had lesser effects. This pivotal
study overall suggests that AXL can serve as an amplifier
of EGFR signaling – at least when it comes to AKT
activation. In addition, AXL can activate a set of distinct
signals that are important for cell migration in response to
stimuli and RTK/AXL co-localization can predict RTKmediated AXL transactivation leading to downstream
pathway output amplification. Based on this and other
studies it appears that ErbB, MET and AXL receptors
can co-exist in local clusters on the plasma membrane
leading to subsequent activation-dependent enhancement
of interactions after stimulation. It might be anticipated
that drugs disrupting this complex interaction may be
efficacious in counteracting such signal diversification.
Overexpression of AXL in esophageal carcinoma
has been shown to promote cisplatin resistance through
regulation of c-ABL/p73 signaling [49]. In AML, AXL has
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

been shown to be induced by various chemotherapeutic
drugs [103], suggesting that a combination of AXL
inhibition with chemotherapy may be a novel therapeutic
approach in AML [44, 110]. AXL overexpression and/or
activation have also been linked to Nilotinib resistance
in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells, and AXL
expression could be a clinically relevant prognostic marker
for resistance to TKI therapy in CML cells [45, 46]. AXL
was also found to be highly expressed in cisplatin-resistant
ovarian cancer and was identified as an essential factor
and therapeutic target in metastatic ovarian cancer [53,
111, 112]. These results suggest that AXL can promote
resistance not only to tyrosine kinase inhibitors but more
broadly as well.

Interplay of AXL/MET and HER family
receptors
In addition to AXL overexpression, MET
overexpression and the expression of its ligand,
HGF have both been described as in vitro and in vivo
mechanisms of resistance to EGFR TKI therapy in
EGFR-mutated lung cancers[113]. The AXL and MET
kinases share a number of structural features and
similarly play important roles in cell migration, invasion
and metastasis. Recent elegant studies shed some light
on the biochemical interplay of these pathways [41, 114,
115]. In a study set out to define the spectrum and
mechanism of HGF/MET-mediated resistance, it was
noted that HGF-induced EGFR TK inhibition is a very
common mechanism in human cancers and in such cases
the kinase-inactive EGFR directly interacts with and
stabilizes several cancer-relevant proteins, including
AXL, EphA2 and the Cub domain containing protein
1. Overall, the model shows that HGF/MET activation
can uncouple the oncogenic activity of EGFR from its
tyrosine kinase activity, effectively allowing downstream
signaling activation via aggregation and transmitting
of EGFR activation to AXL and other receptor
kinases (Figure 2). In fact, HGF activity could block
phosphorylation of EGFR by ligand stimulation mediated
via HGF/MET activation of MEK: furthermore MEK
inhibitors can reverse this phenomenon. This observation
of an alternative mode of EGFR action may explain why
despite the continued inhibition of EGFR TK activity
by EGFR TKIs, downstream activation  of PI3K and
other pathways can persist in the presence of MET/AXL
co-expression. The binding capacity of the interacting
partners, AXL, CDCP1 and EphA2 were unaltered by
gefitinib treatment but binding was effectively abrogated
by MET TK inhibition and MET TK therapy led to
restoration of the anti-proliferative effects of gefitinib.
It remains to be defined whether AXL overexpression
alone in the above listed resistant models can “make
up” to some extent for the lack of HGF/MET activity
and provide a weaker alternative uncoupling of EGFR

activity [116]. However, these studies clearly define
MET and AXL as key targets in EGFR/ErbB2-resistance
and also highlight the potential for novel therapies
interfering with the complex interactions at the cell
membrane interface leading to aggregation of these
disparate receptors (Figure 2).

chronic inflammation raising some concerns about the
use of AXL inhibitors in cancer therapy. For example, in
many cells, some cytokine receptor signaling systems,
such as signaling via the type 1 interferon receptor, are
co-dependent on TAM family receptors [117]. AXL and
MER have indeed been demonstrated to be expressed
on multiple immune cells, such as dendritic cells and
macrophages and have an essential immune-suppressive
role via the abrogation of Toll-like receptor and cytokine
receptor signaling. In the inflammation-associated
colorectal cancer model by azoxymethane and dextran

and MER led to increased production of inflammatory
cytokines favoring a tumor-promoting environment
leading to the enhanced formation of colonic adenomatous
polyps [118]. Therefore, the potential for adverse
effects for tumor promotion through the use of systemic
anticancer therapies targeting AXL might be a concern
and this highlights the importance of more thorough
understanding of the tissue and cell-type specific functions
of AXL. The development of targeting strategies devoid
of pro-inflammatory adverse effects might be optimal for
future development. Therefore, treatment strategies that
spare the RTKs in the macrophage compartment will be
relevant – e.g. therapeutics targeting the unique interface
between AXL and EGFR/MET could provide such
selective advantages.
On the other hand, another recent study suggests a
reverse role for TAM receptors in the regulation of cancer
metastases by the modulation of NK cell activity. This
study found that mice with targeted inactivation of the
E3 ubiquitin ligase, Cbl-B demonstrate enhanced NK cell
activity against metastatic tumor models and this unique
activity was found to be related to the regulation of TAM
family receptors that were found to be ubiquitylation
substrates for Cbl-b. Indeed, further studies showed that a
small molecule TAM kinase inhibitor, LDC1267 confers
treatment potential through enhancing in vivo NK cell
activity and very interestingly, this activity is mimicked
by the anticoagulant warfarin which through its gammacarboxylase inhibitor activity leads to the generation
of deficient Gas6 unable to activate TAM receptors.
These key observations suggest that inhibition of TAM/
AXL activity could in fact have additional anti-cancer
activity through NK cell potentiation against metastatic
disease [119].

emerge as a promising target, studies are starting to emerge
with a specific focus on AXL. Some more relevant studies
are listed below. For example, LY2801653 is a type-II ATP
competitive multi kinase inhibitor of MET and AXL and
MST1R that has been shown to inhibit cellular functions
of MET, including cell migration and proliferation
and anti-tumor activities in multiple mouse xenograft
models [120] [121]. Phase I studies of LY2801653 are
being pursued in patients with advanced cancer. MP470
(Amuvatinib), another multi kinase inhibitor targeting
AXL is being developed actively and is being studied
specifically in gastrointestinal stromal tumors and breast
cancer [102]. Reduction in AXL specific invasiveness in
Hepatocellular carcinoma cells has been observed with
another multikinase inhibitor SKI606 (Bosutinib) [122].
SKI606 (Bosutinib) is now in Phase 1 and 2 clinical
trials for patients with advanced solid tumors including
metastatic breast cancer. Two other exciting compounds
with excellent potency against AXL, MGCD265 and
MGCD516 are in the initial phases of clinical development,
including in Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
[123–126]. ASP2215, which besides showing excellent
activity against FLT3, also is potent against AXL is in
phase 1/2 stages of clinical development in relapsed and
refractory AML patients[110]. XL184 (Cabozantinib),
another multi kinase inhibitor including AXL is in
phase 2 and 3 of clinical trials against many different
types of cancers, such as medullary thyroid, brain and
NSCLC cancers [127–130]. BMS-777607, another
selective small molecule kinase inhibitor against AXL,
Mer, Tyro3 and Met is in Phase 1 studies in subjects with
advanced or metastatic solid tumors [131]. GSK1363089,
also known as XL880 (Foretinib), an oral multikinase inhibitor targeting MET, RON, AXL has been
shown to restore sensitivity in lapatinib-resistant HER2
positive breast cancer cells with AXL overexpression
[101]. XL880 is currently in several clinical studies,
including a phase II, open label, uncontrolled, parallel,
multi-cohort, multicenter 2-stage study to assess the
safety and efficacy in NSCLC patients. Another highly
specific AXL inhibitor, SGI-7079 has led to decreased
malignant properties in inflammatory breast cancer in
preclinical studies. Combining SGI7079 with erlotinib
reversed the resistance in different model systems, such
as in mesenchymal cell lines and xenograft models of
mesenchymal NSCLC [43, 93]. Based on these studies
SGI7079 is now in phase 2 studies. S49076 is a novel
ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitor of MET, AXL/
MER, FGFR1/2/3 that can inhibit autophosphorylation of
these RTKs and their downstream signaling in vitro/vivo.
On the basis of preclinical activity in colon carcinoma, a
phase I trial of S49076 has been initiated in Europe [132].
R428 (BGB324) is another novel small-molecule inhibitor
that can potently block autophosphorylation of AXL on
the COOH-terminal multiple docking site Tyr821 and
consequent activation of AKT, SFK phosphorylation with

Inhibition of AXL as a cancer treatment strategy
As highlighted before, an overexpressed/
overactivated Gas6-AXL axis in a wide variety of
cancers can contribute to their progression, including
invasion, metastasis, and resistance both to chemo as
well as targeted anti-cancer therapies, indicating that
the Gas6/AXL pathway is a very promising target for
cancer therapy. Inhibition of this pathway can practically
be achieved through multiple means e.g. by using AXL
TKIs, drugs targeting the AXL/MET/EGFR interface,
and their downstream signaling effectors or by using
blocking antibodies against Gas6 and AXL. As shown in
Table 2 multiple drug companies are pursuing the clinical
development of a variety of inhibitors either specifically
against AXL or multi-targeted kinase inhibitors with good
potency against AXL as well.
Many of the ongoing clinical trials of such
multikinase drugs have been initiated without a current
focus on AXL as a main target. As early phase studies of
such compounds are completed and AXL continues to

low nanomolar affinity [21]. R428 has entered phase  I
clinical trials in 2013 [133]. In addition to the above
experimental drugs there are some more mentioned in the
table which on the basis of lab findings seem to be very
potent to enter into clinical trials sometime in future.
Other novel methods of inhibiting AXL receptor
specifically include an anti AXL monoclonal antibody,
YW327.6S2 which has shown highly specific activity in
preclinical models[134]. Another quite novel approach
is the development of the Nucleotide aptamer, GLT21.T
which binds to the extracellular domain of AXL and inhibits
its activity in cellular models of lung cancer [135, 136].
Another somewhat different route of targeting AXL
overexpression/activity might be through the inhibition
of key proteins involved in the regulation of protein
trafficking called chaperones, such as heat shock proteins
(HSP’s) involved in protein processing. Recently AXL
in fact was shown to be a client protein of the hsp90
chaperone. In an AXL-dependent thyroid cancer model
system, treatment with the hsp90 inhibitor, 17-AAG led
to a substantial reduction in AXL expression accompanied
by downregulation of AXL activation and downstream
signaling activity. Elegant studies demonstrated that this
activity is dependent on modulation of the trafficking of
the fully glycosylated, mature 140 kDA form of AXL
and this phenomenon appears independent of AXL
phosphorylation. Downregulation in the presence of
hsp90 inhibition is mediated by proteasomal degradation
as a result of polyubiquitination through binding of the
hsp70/CHIP E3 ligase. These data strongly suggest that
AXL overexpression and activity could be successfully
targeted in AXL-addicted tumors or in AXL-mediated
drug –resistant cancers via hsp90 inhibition [137].

appealing biomarker for clinical studies might be imaging
AXL expression in vivo using labeled probes. One study
showed successful labeling with the use of an anti-human
monoclonal AXL antibody radiolabelled with I125 via
SPECT/CT imaging in mice xenografted with AXL-high
and AXL-low pancreatic and prostate cancer cell lines and
uptake appeared to correlate closely with IHC findings.
As AXL expression can be variable within tumors and as
acquired drug resistance studies suggest that it can change
temporally, a biomarker that can image AXL expression
spatially as well as over time would be highly desirable
and with positron-emitting isotopes, such as 89ZR might be
amenable to immuno-PET imaging which could be readily
incorporated into AXL-targeting clinical studies [138].

Future perspectives
The last few years have seen tremendous advances
in our understanding of the wide relevance of AXL
activation in multiple aspects of oncogenesis, invasion,
metastasis and drug resistance. The field appears poised
to take on the next and most important task and define
the true translational potential of AXL inhibition in the
clinic. Key issues to address in the coming years include
the following relevant questions:
1.	 What is the mechanism of AXL overexpression/
activation in human cancers? Is AXL overexpression
mediated through genetic, epigenetic or other mechanisms
in different cancer subsets and could better understanding
of AXL regulation yield clinically useful biomarkers?
2.	 What is the correlation between AXL expression
and the elusive EMT phenomenon? Is AXL a driver or
an effector of EMT or is it just an epiphenomenon of the
EMT process?
3.	 How do the AXL/MET cell surface complexes
form in drug resistant tumors and could better
understanding of this key bypass pathway yield novel
therapeutics to affect drug resistance?
4.	 How does AXL inhibition impact cancer
immunity outside of its utility to block tumor metastasis,
invasion and reverse drug resistance? Can immune
deficiency be a major roadblock in the development
of AXL inhibitors or can it be bypassed through some
means? Alternatively, could inhibitors of the AXL/GAS6

Biomarker development for AXL-targeting
agents
One key issue for the development of AXLtargeted therapies for human use is the selection of
appropriate biomarkers for patient enrichment. As no
genetic changes have been reported so far correlating
with AXL overexpression, IHC appears to be the method
of choice and has been utilized in a number of in vitro
and animal studies successfully. Another potentially

activation?
5.	 Clinical studies of AXL inhibitors will need to
incorporate multiple potentially relevant biomarkers of
AXL activity/dependency as well as biomarkers of antitumor immunity to ensure that key signals from ongoing
studies are not missed in this area which currently lacks
a validated biomarker for appropriate patient selection.
In addition, given the very different contextual aspects of
AXLs role in carcinogenesis, invasion/metastasis/EMT
and drug resistance, clinical studies will need to assess
these carefully in each particular scenario.
