BACKGROUND: The authors exploited a large database to investigate the outcomes of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma in the
contemporary era. METHODS: All patients with high-risk neuroblastoma aged <12 years who were treated during induction at the
authors’ institution from 2000 through 2011 were studied, including 118 patients with MYCN-amplified [MYCN(1)] disease and 127
patients aged >18 months with MYCN-nonamplified [MYCN(2)] stage 4 disease. RESULTS: A complete response=very good partial
response (CR=VGPR) to induction was correlated with significantly superior event-free survival (EFS) (P <.001) and overall survival
(OS) (P <.001) compared with a partial response or less. Patients with MYCN(1) and MYCN(2) disease had similar rates of CR=VGPR
to induction (P 5.366), and those with MYCN(1) and MYCN(2) disease who attained a CR=VGPR had similar EFS (P 5.346) and OS
(P 5.542). In contrast, only MYCN(1) patients had progressive disease as a response to induction (P <.001), and early death from progressive disease (<366 days after diagnosis) was significantly more common (P <.001) among those with MYCN(1) disease. Overall,
among patients who had a partial response or less, MYCN(1) patients had significantly inferior EFS (P <.001) and OS (P <.001) compared with MYCN(2) patients, which accounted for the significantly worse EFS (P 5.008) and OS (P 5.002) for the entire MYCN(1)
cohort versus the MYCN(2) cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MYCN(2), high-risk neuroblastoma display a broad, continuous
spectrum with regard to response and outcome, whereas MYCN(1) patients either have an excellent response to induction associated
with good long-term outcome or develop early progressive disease with a poor outcome. This extreme dichotomy in the clinical
course of MYCN(1) patients points to underlying biologic differences with MYCN(1) neuroblastoma, the elucidation of which may
have far-reaching implications, including improved risk classification at diagnosis and the identification of targets for treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Population-based data1-3 and group studies through the 1990s4-11 demonstrated 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and
overall survival (OS) rates of 17% to 37% for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma (HR-NB) and little difference
between EFS and OS (see Table 1, Studies completed in the 1990s). In large studies that extended beyond the year 2000,
5-year EFS and OS rates improved to 35% to 64% (see Table 1, Studies completed in the 2000s).12-16 These results may
represent overestimations of survival, because subsequent analyses revealed a more limited definition of HR-NB. Those
studies included: 1) patients ages 12 to 18 months who had MYCN-nonamplified [MYCN(2)] stage 4 disease, which is
now recognized as intermediate-risk disease17,18; and 2) toddlers who had MYCN(2) stage 3 disease with unfavorable histology, which may be cured by limited therapy.19 Indeed, a group study conducted from 1999 to 2004 that focused on a
well recognized high-risk group—ie, MYCN-amplified [MYCN(1)] NB in infants—yielded 2-year EFS and OS rates of
29% and 30%, respectively,14 and an international experience that covered the years from 1997 to 2002 for patients aged
>18 months who had MYCN(1) stage 4 NB yielded an EFS rate of 18%.18
Better results have been expected with the recent adoption of therapies—many of which were developed in the
1990s—promising more effective induction (dose-dense or dose-intensive chemotherapy),8,20,21 consolidation (13-cisretinoic acid,10 local radiotherapy,22 anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody [MoAb]23,24), and salvage (131Imetaiodobenzylguanidine [MIBG] therapy,25 topoisomerase 1 inhibitors26-28). We used the large Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) database to investigate the outcome of HR-NB in the contemporary era, ie, since
2000. We took into account MYCN amplification, because large studies differ regarding whether this finding is4,6,10,13 or is

not5,8,12,15 prognostic in HR-NB (Table 1). We also
assessed response to induction vis-a-vis EFS and OS,
given differences in past studies regarding whether a
good response does8,10,13,14 or does not4,6,15 have
an impact on the survival of patients with HR-NB
(Table 1). The data revealed a striking dichotomy in the
clinical course of patients with MYCN(1) disease, a
scenario not observed in patients with MYCN(2)
HR-NB.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study subjects were identified from the NB patient registry of MSKCC. This source listed 1185 patients for the
period from 2000 to 2011. The current study was limited
to the 247 patients who were aged <12 years when diagnosed with HR-NB and who received treatment during
induction at MSKCC from the time of diagnosis or after
starting induction elsewhere. Excluded were patients who
came for consultation alone or only for surgery. The definition of HR-NB conformed with current criteria:
MYCN(1) stage 2, 3, 4S, or 4 disease in patients of any
age or MYCN(2) stage 4 disease diagnosed at age >18
months.17,18 MYCN amplification was defined by international criteria using fluorescence in situ hybridization.29
In accordance with rules of the MSKCC Institutional
Review Board, informed written consents for evaluations
and treatments were obtained from guardians; and, for
this exploratory study, as a retrospective review, a waiver
was obtained for examination and analysis of patient
records.
Disease status was defined according to widely
accepted international response criteria,6,8,11,14-16,30
including 123I-MIBG findings. Complete remission (CR)
was defined as no evidence of NB in soft tissue, bones, or
bone marrow (BM) and normal urine catecholamine levels. Very good partial remission (VGPR) was defined as a
primary mass reduced by 90%; no evidence of distant
disease in soft tissue, bones, or BM, including a negative
123
I-MIBG scan; and normal urine catecholamine levels.
A partial response (PR) indicated a decrease >50% in
measurable soft tissue disease and in the number of metastatic skeletal lesions on a 123I-MIBG scan and 1 positive BM site. A mixed response indicated a decrease
>50% in any lesion with a decrease <50% in any other
and a 123I-MIBG scan improved by a <50% decrease in
the number of positive sites. No response was defined as a
decrease <50% but an increase <25% in any existing
lesion and unchanged MIBG findings. Finally, progressive disease (PD) was defined as a new lesion or an increase
>25% in an existing lesion.
2052

A complete evaluation of disease status comprised
computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging
studies, a 123I-MIBG scan, urine catecholamine levels,
and BM histology (aspirates and biopsies from bilateral
posterior iliac crests and aspirates with or without biopsies
from bilateral anterior iliac crests). BM and imaging studies were read by MSKCC specialists outside the Department of Pediatrics who were unaware of treatment or
patient status. A complete evaluation was performed at
the end of induction. Patients who achieved CR=VGPR
underwent a complete evaluation at least every 3 months
for an additional 2 years and then had 123I-MIBG scans
with or without other staging studies every 3 months for 3
more years. Patients who achieved only a PR or less
(PR) with induction underwent a complete evaluation
every 1 to 3 months while on therapy; if they achieved
CR=VGPR, then a complete evaluation was repeated every 3 months for 3 more years.
The software package SPSS (version 11.0; SPSS
Inc., Chicago, Ill) was used for the statistical analyses of
survival, calculating from the first day of induction chemotherapy. Survival curves were generated according to the
Kaplan-Meier method, with point estimates that included
6 the standard error, and were compared using a 2-sided
log-rank test. EFS continued through the date of PD,
toxic death, or secondary cancer. OS was defined through
the date of death from any cause. The 2-tailed chi-square
test was used for comparisons of response rates to induction therapy.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

The total series of patients included 118 MYCN(1)
patients (1 patient with stage 2 disease, 13 patients with
stage 3 disease, 1 patient with stage 4S disease, and 103
patients with stage 4 disease), 127 MYCN(2) patients
with stage 4 disease diagnosed at age >18 months, and 2
patients with unknown MYCN status. The latter 2
patients were excluded from further analysis, leaving a
final total of 245 patients for the current study (Table 2).
Thirty-one patients were infants (ie, aged <18 months),
and all had MYCN(1) disease. MYCN(1) patients and
MYCN(2) patients received the same upfront and salvage
therapies. Thus, the initial (first-line) induction regimens
were all for HR-NB: 223 patients (91%) received Children’s Oncology Group16,21 (or similar MSKCC20) regimens, and 22 patients (9%) received other group-wide8,9
or single-institutional programs. Consolidation of
CR=VGPR included anti-GD2 MoAb with or without

second-line treatments for refractory or progressive disease
with induction included high-dose conventional chemotherapy31-34 or moderate-dose regimens28,35 using agents
with known anti-NB activity. Relapse also was treated
uniformly, including intrathecal radioimmunotherapy for

chemotherapy31-34 for disseminated or soft-tissue relapse,
and moderate-dose chemotherapy28,35 plus radiotherapy
for focal skeletal relapse. Patients who achieved second

Responses to Induction (Table 2)

CR=VGPR was achieved with first-line induction treatment in 127 of 245 patients (52%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 45%-58%), including 68 of 118 (58%; 95% CI,
48%-67%) MYCN(1) patients and 59 of 127 (46%;
95% CI, 38%-56%) MYCN(2) patients (P 5 .366). PR
rates also were similar between the MYCN(1) cohort
Cancer

July 1, 2014

(11%; 95% CI, 6%-18%) and the MYCN(2) cohort
(17%; 95% CI, 11%-25%; P 5 .2). In contrast, a PD
response to induction was limited to those with
MYCN(1) disease, occurring in 24 of 118 (20%; 95%
CI, 13%-29%) MYCN(1) patients compared with 0 of
127 MYCN(2) patients (P < .001).
EFS and OS Correlated With MYCN

For the entire cohort of 245 patients, the EFS rates at 3
years, 5 years, and 7 years were 44%, 37%, and 35%,
respectively; and the OS rates were 67%, 57%, and 53%,
respectively. MYCN(1) patients (n 5 118) had significantly inferior EFS and OS compared with MYCN(2)
patients (n 5 127) (Table 3, Fig. 1). Thus, at 3 years, 5
years, and 7 years, the EFS rates were 37%, 32%, and
32%, respectively, in MYCN(1) patients versus 49%,
41%, and 38%, respectively, in MYCN(2) patients
(P 5 .008); and the OS rates were 56%, 48%, and 46%
versus 77%, 66%, and 60%, respectively (P 5 .002).

were 34%, 34%, and 34%, respectively, in infants compared with 38%, 31%, and 31%, respectively, in children
(P 5 .828); and the corresponding OS rates were 55%,
55%, and 55%, respectively, in infants compared with
56%, 44%, and 42%, respectively, in children
(P 5 .664).
Correlation of EFS and OS With Response to
Induction

EFS and OS rates for the patients who achieved
CR=VGPR with initial induction therapy (n 5 127) were
significantly better than those for the patients who had
PR (n 5 118) (Table 3; Fig. 2). Thus, at 3 years, 5 years,
and 7 years, the EFS rates were 58%, 51%, and 50%,
respectively, for patients who achieved CR=VGPR versus
28%, 21%, and 19%, respectively, for those who had
<PR (P < .001); and the corresponding OS rates were
80%, 74%, and 70%, respectively, for patients who
achieved CR=VGPR versus 53%, 38%, and 35%, respectively, for those who had <PR (P < .001).
Among the patients who achieved CR=VGPR, the
EFS and OS rates were similar for the MYCN(1) patients
(n 5 68) and the MYCN(2) patients (n 5 59) (Table 2,
Fig. 3). Thus, at 3 years, 5 years, and 7 years, the EFS rates
were 54%, 48%, and 48%, respectively, for MYCN(1)
patients versus 63%, 54%, and 52%, respectively, for
MYCN(2) patients (P 5 .346); and the OS rates were
75%, 68%, and 68%, respectively, for MYCN(1)
patients versus 86%, 80%, and 72%, respectively, for
MYCN(2) patients (P 5 .542). These results indicate

that the long-term OS rates for MYCN(1) patients and
MYCN(2) patients who attained CR=VGPR after induction were approximately 20% greater than their respective
long-term EFS rates.
Among the patients who had PR to induction,
EFS and OS rates for MYCN(1) patients (n 5 50) were
significantly inferior to those for MYCN(2) patients
(n 5 68) (Table 3, Fig. 4). Thus, at 3 years, 5 years, and 7
years, the EFS rates were 14%, 9%, and 9%, respectively,
for MYCN(1) patients versus 37%, 30%, and 26%,
respectively, for MYCN(2) patients (P < .001); and the
OS rates were 29%, 18%, and 14%, respectively, for
MYCN(1) patients versus 70%, 53%, and 50%, respectively, for MYCN(2) patients (P < .001). These results
demonstrate that the long-term EFS and OS rates for the
MYCN(1) patients were similar, whereas the long-term
EFS and OS rates for the MYCN(2) patients differed by
approximately 20% to 30%.
DISCUSSION
Patients with MYCN(2) HR-NB display a broad, continuous spectrum with regard to response and survival,
whereas patients with MYCN(1) HR-NB either have an
excellent response to induction associated with a good
long-term outcome or develop early PD with a poor outcome. This extreme dichotomy in the clinical scenarios
of MYCN(1) patients may result from underlying, distinctive genetic features. The elucidation of these divergent biologic profiles may have far-reaching

implications, including improved risk classification at
diagnosis and the identification of targets for treatment.
Unfortunately, there are currently no known biologic
findings at diagnosis that can predict the outcome of
MYCN(1) patients, because virtually all MYCN(1)
NBs are associated with certain biomarkers (eg chromosome 17q gain and chromosome 1p deletion) and not
with others (eg chromosome 11q deletion and ATRX
gene mutations).
The MYCN(1) and MYCN(2) cohorts in the current study received the same induction, consolidative,
and salvage treatments (Table 2); this uniformity lends
validity to our comparison of outcomes. A key finding
was PD response to first-line induction with MYCN(1)
disease, before consolidation could start. With regard to
widely used postinduction treatments, among patients
who achieved CR=VGPR with first-line induction, early
death was rare, occurring in 2 of 66 MYCN(1) patients
consolidated with ASCT plus MoAb (n 5 26) or with
MoAb (n 5 40), and in 1 of 58 MYCN(2) patients consolidated with ASCT plus MoAb (n 5 24) or with
MoAb (n 5 34). Initial treatment of refractory disease or
PD involved chemotherapy with well recognized antiNB activity rather than investigative agents.
Patients with MYCN(1) and MYCN(2) NB have
equivalent CR=VGPR rates with induction (P 5 .366),
and MYCN is not prognostic for patients in CR=VGPR
at completion of induction. Thus, MYCN(1) and
MYCN(2) patients who achieve CR=VGPR with induc2056

tion have similar long-term EFS and OS (Table 3, Fig. 3).
In distinct contrast, PD response to induction is limited
to MYCN(1) patients (P < .001), and early PD is significantly associated with MYCN(1) disease (P < .001).
Early treatment failure not only adversely affects EFS but
contributes to a dismal OS, because PD of HR-NB during, or soon after completion of, induction responds
poorly to salvage therapy,31 and short time from diagnosis
to PD is a significant adverse factor for OS.37-41 Indeed,
MYCN(1) patients are significantly more likely than
MYCN(2) patients to die early from PD (P < .001), ie,
<366 days from diagnosis. Overall, among patients with
PR to induction, MYCN(1) disease is associated with
significantly inferior EFS (P < .001) and OS (P < .001);
these results account for the significantly worse long-term
EFS (P 5 .008) and OS (P 5 .002) of the entire
MYCN(1) cohort compared with the entire MYCN(2)
cohort (Table 3, Fig. 1). Age had no prognostic impact on
MYCN(1) disease: infants and children with this chromosomal aberration had similar long-term EFS and OS
(Table 3).
The PD findings, combined with the significantly
worse EFS and OS of MYCN(1) patients compared with
MYCN(2) patients who attain PR postinduction, suggest that a major response to upfront therapy is crucial for
a good outcome in MYCN(1) patients and is less crucial
in MYCN(2) patients. This point is supported by the absence of continued decline in EFS for MYCN(1) patients
over the long term, whereas EFS rates for MYCN(2)

patients decrease steadily beyond 3 years (Table 3, Fig. 1).
The findings reflect a paucity of late relapses among
patients who have MYCN(1) HR-NB compared with
those who have MYCN(2) HR-NB.
The paramount prognostic importance of initial
response for MYCN(1) patients, but not for MYCN(2)
patients, is also illustrated by the relation between EFS
and OS rates within subsets of patients. Thus, the
MYCN(1) patients who had PR to induction had longterm EFS and OS rates that approximated each other (Table 3, Fig. 4). This similarity between EFS and OS is consistent with a rapid demise of these patients after
PD=relapse and is attributable to the persistence of underlying chemoresistance as well as ineffective second-line
therapy (see below). In contrast, MYCN(1) patients who
achieved CR=VGPR with induction had a long-term OS
that was approximately 20% higher than their EFS: evidence of prolonged survival postrelapse attributable to
continued chemosensitivity (Table 3, Fig. 3). This difference between the outcomes of MYCN(1) patients in
PR versus those in CR=VGPR was not seen among the
patients with MYCN(2) HR-NB; indeed, all patients
with MYCN(2) HR-NB—those in CR=VGPR and those
with PR after induction—had long-term OS rates that,
like the MYCN(1) patients in CR=VGPR postinduction,
were approximately 20% higher than their EFS rates (Table 3, Figs. 3 and 4).
These large differences between long-term EFS and
OS during the period from 2000 to 2011 among all
Cancer

patients with MYCN(2) HR-NB and among the
MYCN(1) patients in CR=VGPR, but not among those
in PR postinduction, were not seen in the 1990s (Table
1).4-11 In that decade, EFS and OS were closely related,
which supported the view that PD=relapse of HR-NB was
synonymous with a subsequent rapid demise from PD or
from the toxicity of salvage therapy. Exceptions to this
scenario led to the initial reports of long-term survival in
children with HR-NB despite persistence or relapse of disease.38,42 This phenomenon of chronic NB was much less
common in MYCN(1) patients than in MYCN(2)
patients.37-42An underlying biologic factor for chronicity
may be mutations of the ATRX gene, which recently were
found to be significantly associated with MYCN(2) HRNB in older patients,43 in whom NB is often characterized
by an indolent and prolonged, although ultimately lethal,
course.44
Consistent with a low likelihood of prolonged survival after MYCN(1) PD=relapse, EFS and OS were poor
and virtually identical in the few reports that offered
details about MYCN(1) patients. Thus, in a multicenter
study of MYCN(1) infants from 1999 to 2004, the EFS
and OS rates at only 2 years were 29% and 30%, respectively, for all stages (the 2-year OS rate was 20% for
patients with stage 4 disease)14; reviews of an international
experience from 1990 to 2002 found that MYCN(1)
stage 4 and 4S disease in patients aged <18 months had
5-year EFS and OS rates of 28% and 34%, respectively,45
and that MYCN(1) stage 4 disease in patients aged >18

months had 5-year EFS and OS rates <25% each17; and a
group-wide study from 1991 to 1996 of patients with
MYCN(1) stage 3 disease (all ages) yielded 5-year EFS
and OS rates of 25% and 27%, respectively.11
One reason why the above-described clinical scenario, which was typical in the 1990s (ie, death soon after
PD=relapse), may no longer hold true is the availability of
novel, relatively nontoxic salvage (ie, second-line) therapies that lack cross-resistance with induction. Examples
include chemotherapy regimens (eg, irinotecan-temozolomide28), investigative agents (eg, fenretinide, ABT-751,
crizotinib),46 and targeted radiotherapy (131I-MIBG25
and 131I-monoclonal antibodies36). Another factor contributing to prolonged survival may be improved disease
surveillance. In the 1990s, MIBG scintigraphy often used
131
I and was not regularly performed (Table 2)5,8,10; subsequently, 123I-MIBG became widely adopted and proved
to be superior in detecting NB, especially relapse that is
asymptomatic (and presumably has lower tumor burden),
which may be more amenable to control than bulky metastatic relapse.47 Unfortunately, the welcome prospect that
the recent advances in therapy and surveillance might, after relapse, lead to a chronic course with long-term survival plus good quality of life, or even a cure, is not
relevant to patients who develop early PD—a subset of
patients associated significantly with MYCN(1) NB
(P < .001) (Table 3).
In conclusion, results from the 1970s through the
contemporary era indicate that better upfront, consolidative, and salvage therapies have improved the survival of
patients with HR-NB.1-3,12-15,18,23,24 Yet MYCN(1) NB
differs significantly from MYCN(2) HR-NB with regard
to 1) PD response to induction, and 2) extreme differences in outcome, ie, early death from disease or excellent
PFS and OS. The 2 sharply divergent clinical scenarios of
MYCN(1) patients merit investigation at the molecular=genetic level, analogous to other investigations into
the underlying biology of NB,43,46 to identify markers
predictive at diagnosis of good response=good outcome
versus poor response=early demise and to expand the
availability of targets for therapy.
