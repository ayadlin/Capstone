Abstract
Ethylene oxide (EO) is widely used in the chemical industry
and is also formed in humans through the metabolic oxidation of ethylene, generated during physiologic processes. EO
is classified as a human carcinogen and is a direct acting
alkylating agent, primarily forming N7-(2-hydroxyethyl)guanine (N7-HEG). To conduct accurate human risk assessments,
it is vital to ascertain the relative contribution of endogenously versus exogenously derived DNA damage and identify
the sources of background lesions. We have therefore defined
in vivo dose-response relationships over a concentration
range relevant to human EO exposures using a dual-isotope
approach. By combining liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatographyaccelerator mass spectrometry analysis, both the endogenous
and exogenous N7-HEG adducts were quantified in tissues of
[14C]EO-treated rats. Levels of [14C]N7-HEG induced in spleen,
liver, and stomach DNA increased in a linear manner from
0.002 to 4 adducts/108 nucleotides. More importantly, the
extent of damage arising through this route was insignificant
compared with the background abundance of N7-HEG
naturally present. However, at the two highest doses, [14C]EO
exposure caused a significant increase in endogenous N7-HEG
formation in liver and spleen, suggesting that EO can induce
physiologic pathways responsible for ethylene generation
in vivo and thereby indirectly promote N7-HEG production.
We present evidence for a novel mechanism of adduct formation to explain this phenomenon, involving oxidative stress
and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid as a potential biosynthetic precursor to ethylene in mammalian cells. Based on
the proposed pathway, N7-HEG may have potential as a biomarker of cellular oxidative stress. [Cancer Res 2009;69(7):3052–9]

Introduction
Ethylene oxide (EO) is a widely used industrial intermediate in
the manufacture of chemicals and is used as an agricultural
fumigant and sterilizing agent, particularly for medical equipment
and heat-sensitive goods (1). It is estimated that in the U.S. health
care sector, as many as 325,000 people are exposed directly or
incidentally to EO in the workplace (2). Whereas initial epidemiology studies suggested links between an elevated risk of leukemia

and stomach cancer and occupational exposure to EO (3–5), many
subsequent reports are inconclusive or contradictory about the
ability of EO to induce specific cancers or increase cancer-related
mortality (6–9). Despite the conflicting epidemiologic evidence, EO
is classified by the IARC as carcinogenic to humans, primarily
based on results from animal carcinogenicity studies, the fact that
it is a direct alkylating agent that elevates mutation frequencies in
rodent models, and evidence of chromosomal damage in peripheral
blood lymphocytes of exposed workers (10).
The mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of EO is attributed to
reaction with DNA, leading to the formation of multiple 2hydroxyethyl adducts (11, 12). The most abundant product, N7-(2hydroxyethyl)guanine (N7-HEG), readily depurinates, leaving
abasic sites with miscoding potential (13, 14). Measurement of
N7-HEG in animal or human cellular DNA can provide a valuable
biomarker of total EO exposure at the target site, vital information
for risk assessment purposes. A confounding factor in evaluating
the risks associated with EO inhalation is the fact that ethylene is
also generated in vivo during normal physiologic processes and can
be converted to the epoxide by cytochrome P450 2E1 (15). Humans
are therefore continually exposed to EO, as illustrated by detectable
N7-HEG at levels of f1 to 10/107 nucleotides in lymphocytes
isolated from people not knowingly in contact with EO (16–18).
Physiologic sources of ethylene are believed to include methionine
oxidation, lipid peroxidation, and the metabolizing activity of
intestinal bacteria (19–21); however, the mechanisms of formation
in mammalian systems have not been defined in any of these cases
and the origins of endogenous N7-HEG adducts have never been
directly shown.
For genotoxic carcinogens such as EO, the current regulatory
stance assumes that a linear relationship exists between exposure,
the formation of DNA lesions, and subsequent conversion into
mutations, although measurable increases in mutagenic events are
only associated with relatively high doses (22, 23). Consequently,
demonstration that a chemical is able to form DNA adducts at high
exposures is often taken as sufficient evidence for carcinogenic
potential at lower doses. However, nothing is actually known about
the dose-response relationships for occupational or environmentally generated EO at the low concentrations humans are exposed
to. Furthermore, this position fails to recognize that practical risk
thresholds may be apparent for certain genotoxic agents where high
levels of structurally identical endogenous adducts also exist (24).
To assess the true risk associated with inhaled EO, distinct from
that presented by ubiquitous background DNA damage caused by
endogenous EO, it is necessary to distinguish between the two
types of lesions and ascertain the relative contribution of damage
arising from the different sources. Sensitivity limitations and an
inability to differentiate identical adducts formed by multiple

Dose-Response Relationships for EO DNA Adducts

routes using conventional analysis methods have made this
difficult to achieve. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), a
technique traditionally used in the archaeological and geological
sciences, allows for the extremely sensitive and accurate tracing of
rare long-lived radioisotopes, such as 14C, in biological samples
(25). It is one of the most sensitive methods available for DNA
adduct quantification, capable of detecting as little as f1 to 10
adducts/1012 nucleotides. Exploiting the attomole sensitivity of
AMS, we have defined the in vivo dosimetry for EO over a
concentration range relevant to humans using a dual-isotope
approach, combining liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-AMS analysis for the quantification of endogenous
and exogenous N7-HEG adducts, respectively, in tissues of [14C]EOexposed rats. Results suggested a new mechanism of endogenous
ethylene production in mammalian cells, mediated by oxidative
stress and stimulated by EO administration. Further investigations revealed 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) as
a potential biosynthetic precursor to ethylene and subsequent
N7-HEG formation.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals. [U-14C]EO (52 mCi/mmol) was purchased from GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences. Solvents were acquired from Fisher and all other
chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated.
Animals and treatment. Male Fischer-344 rats (6–7 wk old) purchased
from Harlan were randomized into groups and acclimatized for 7 d in
standard cages. Dosing solutions were prepared by condensing 14C-labeled
EO gas on ice and producing a stock solution by addition of ice-cold PBS
(pH 7.0), which was then diluted as required. All solutions were prepared
fresh on a daily basis using a new ampoule of [14C]EO and were kept on ice
in sealed containers and then allowed to reach room temperature over
f10 min immediately before dosing. Rats (four per group) were administered [14C]EO or vehicle only at doses of 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, 0.001, 0.0005,
0.0001, or 0 mg/kg daily by i.p. injection for 3 consecutive days. Animals
were sacrificed 4 h after the last dose. Blood was obtained by cardiac
puncture after culling and specified tissues were removed. DNA was
extracted using a Qiagen 500 tip kit (Qiagen, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For the quantitation of adduct levels, samples from
only three animals per group were used due to the costs associated with
AMS analysis. For determination of tissue and blood concentrations of
[14C]EO equivalents, samples were analyzed from all four rats.
Liquid scintillation counting. Liquid scintillation counting (LSC) was
performed on a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation system (Beckman Coulter).
Hydrofluor scintillation fluid (6 mL; National Diagnostics) was added to
40 mg of tissue or 100 AL blood and samples were counted for 10 min. To
allow direct comparisons between tissue and blood, values were expressed
in terms of pg/mg on the basis that 1 mL blood has a mass of 1 g.
Isolation of N7-HEG by neutral thermal depurination. Typically, DNA
samples (100 Ag, 1 Ag/AL in water) were added to 1,000 fmol of the
[15N 5]N7-HEG internal standard and incubated at 100jC for 15 min. Icecold ethanol was added (80 AL) and the samples were centrifuged through a
Microcon filter (3,000 molecular weight cutoff) at 14,000 rpm (1 h, room
temperature). The filtrate was split in half, with one aliquot being used for
HPLC-AMS analysis and the remainder concentrated and redissolved in
100 AL of 40% methanol in 0.5% acetic acid for LC-MS/MS analysis. Both
14
C-labeled and endogenous N7-HEG adduct levels were determined in
three rats from each treatment group.
Determination of N7-HEG in DNA samples by LC-MS/MS. Unlabeled
N7-HEG adducts were quantified using our validated LC-MS/MS method as
described previously (26). Each sample of hydrolyzed DNA (50 Ag) was
injected onto a Zorbax 300SB C18 column (5 Am, 4.6  250 mm; Agilent),
attached to a KrudKatcher disposable precolumn (0.5 Am) filter (Phenomenex), and eluted using a gradient mobile phase of (A) 0.5% acetic acid and

(B) 100% methanol as follows: 95% A from 0 to 7 min, 95% to 70% A from 7
to 9 min, and then 70% to 95% A from 9 to 11 min with a flow rate of
0.85 mL/min. Samples were analyzed in the positive ionization mode using
selected reaction monitoring (SRM) for the transitions m/z 196!152 and
201!157 (26). Adduct values were corrected to take into account any
contribution from the unlabeled fraction of the [14C]EO dose administered
(16.7% or 91.7% at the two highest concentrations). For each sample, using
the [14C]N7-HEG value determined by AMS, the number of unlabeled
adducts formed by [14C]EO was calculated and then subtracted from the
N7-HEG level measured by LC-MS/MS.
HPLC isolation of [14C]N7-HEG adducts. The remaining half of the
filtrate from the neutral thermal hydrolysis was subjected to HPLC to
isolate the [14C]N7-HEG peak of interest. This was performed on a Jasco
instrument, comprising intelligent HPLC pumps (PY-1580), a dynamic mixer
(HG-1580-32), and an intelligent sampler (AS-1555). Samples were separated
using the same column type, flow rate, and gradient mobile phase used for
LC-MS/MS analysis described above. UV absorbance was monitored using a
multiwave detector at 254 nm. At least one blank run was performed
between samples to prevent cross-contamination. Typically, fractions were
collected at 15-s intervals for the run duration and then samples expected
to contain [14C]N7-HEG were processed for AMS analysis (27).
AMS analysis. AMS analysis was carried out at the Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory according to standard protocols (28, 29). Each HPLC
fraction was supplemented with 1 AL tributyrin, providing 615 Ag carbon.
Graphite samples were analyzed for radiocarbon content up to seven times
or until measurement variation was within F5%. Results were converted
from Fraction Modern into attomoles of 14C per fraction and the mean
background level of 14C, measured in fractions collected from a blank HPLC
run, was subtracted from each fraction. For each run, where individual
values were above the limit of detection (f1 attomole 14C/fraction), the 14C
content in fractions corresponding to the [14C]N7-HEG peak was summed
and converted into an adduct level/1012 nucleotides.
Detection of N7-HEG adducts in human colon cells. Human colon
adenocarcinoma HCA-7 cells obtained from the European Collection of Cell
Cultures were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS (Life
Technologies) at 37jC in 5% CO2. Cells were treated with H2O2 (50 and
100 Amol/L) or vehicle (water) for 4 or 24 h. In a separate study, cells were
incubated with ACC (1 mmol/L) or solvent (water) and added fresh each
day after replacing the medium for a period of 7 d. Adherent cells were
trypsinized and washed by centrifugation in PBS, and DNA was extracted
immediately using a DNeasy kit (Qiagen). N7-HEG adducts were quantified
by LC-MS/MS.
Western blotting. Whole-cell extracts were harvested in SDS/sample
buffer [40% glycerol, 0.24 mol/L Tris (pH 6.8), 8% SDS, 20% 2mercaptoethanol], and protein concentrations were measured by the
Bradford Assay (Bio-Rad). The Protein 3 Bio-Rad Western blotting system
was used with 100 Ag protein on a 10% gel. Human CYP2E1 Supersomes
(BD Gentest) were used as a positive control. Membranes were probed with
anti-human CYP2E1 IgG (30). The secondary antibody was anti-rabbit
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase.
LC-MS/MS analysis of ACC. Extracts of HCA-7 cells and rat liver
homogenates were prepared based on a published method (31). Typically,
200 mg tissue or 1  106 cells were homogenized in 100 AL of acetone/
methanol (1:4). After incubation (15 min, 37jC), the supernatant was
concentrated to dryness and reconstituted in mobile phase (100 AL).
Chromatographic separations were carried out on a Waters Atlantis C18
3 Am column (2.1  150 mm) with isocratic elution using 1.8 mmol/L
nonafluoropentanoic acid in water/methanol (90:10) at a flow rate of
0.19 mL/min. The column was coupled to a Micromass Quattro Ultima
mass spectrometer (Waters) equipped with an electrospray interface
operated in positive ion mode. ACC was detected using SRM for the
transition m/z 102!56, which results from loss of the -CHO2 moiety from
the protonated molecular ion.
Linear regression and statistical analysis. To examine the doseresponse relationship for [14C]N7-HEG adduct formation, all data were
square root transformed to give a distribution closer to normality. Linear
regression was then performed using the R function for modeling apparent

University of Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany).4 Having identified the best
fitting model, the first concentration of [14C]EO to yield a significant
increase (P < 0.05) in adduct levels over background was determined using
an approach devised and kindly provided by the BioStatistics Department
at Covance Laboratories. The control (group 0) was compared with the
lowest concentration of 0.0001 mg/kg (group 1) using a one-sided twosample t test. Groups 0 and 1 combined were then compared with the
0.0005 mg/kg dose (group 2) using the same test. Subsequently, each
concentration was compared with the previous three combined, after first
testing whether these were similar (equality of the means) using a one-way
ANOVA. The first significant value was defined as the concentration that
produced a statistically significant (P < 0.05) difference from the preceding
concentrations, with all higher concentrations having the same or greater
response. All other DNA adduct data were analyzed by the Student’s t test
using Microsoft Excel.

Results and Discussion
[14C]EO blood and tissue concentrations. Daily administration of [14C]EO to rats by i.p. injection for 3 days over a dose
range spanning 3 orders of magnitude resulted in a linear, dosedependent increase in both blood and liver concentrations of
[14C]EO equivalents (Fig. 1A). Tissue levels were higher than blood,
typically by a factor of f5, with maximum concentrations of
f175 pg/mg achieved following the 0.1 mg/kg dose. Blood levels
ranged from f0.1 to 36 pg/mg [14C]EO equivalents between the
0.0005 and 0.1 mg/kg doses. Despite environmental monitoring and
information on external exposures, there is a paucity of data on
internal exposure to EO in terms of blood or tissue concentrations in humans. A physiologic-based pharmacokinetic model
developed by Fennel and colleagues (32) and validated using data
from workers in a hospital sterilizing unit (33) describes blood
concentrations up to a maximum of f105 Ag/L (f105 pg/mg)
for EO air levels reaching f12.5 ppm. Moreover, exposures of
f1 ppm, the 8-hour time weighted average permissible exposure

NOTE: Values are the mean F SE for three rats per group. For the [14C]N7-HEG adducts only, formed by direct reaction of [14C]EO with DNA, the first

limit for airborne EO in the United States, were associated with
blood concentrations of <20 Ag/L (f20 pg/mg). Importantly, this
indicates that the blood concentrations attained in rats encompass
the range to which humans are subjected, with doses <0.05 mg/kg
approximating to exposures of <1 ppm.
Dose-response relationship for [14C]N7-HEG and N7-HEG
adducts. To define the dose-response relationship for adducts
formed as a direct consequence of exogenous EO exposure, the
levels of [14C]N7-HEG in rat tissues were quantified by HPLC-AMS.
A HPLC separation step was incorporated before AMS analysis,
rather than simply measuring radiocarbon in the total filtrate
produced from thermal depurination of DNA, to specifically isolate
the adduct of interest and remove any interfering lesions such as
N3-2-hydroxyethyladenine (N3-HEA), which would also be liberated under these conditions (11). Using the HPLC system employed
N3-HEA elutes before and is completely resolved from the N7-HEG
adduct (data not shown); therefore, it does not contribute to the
measured 14C level. AMS analysis of an entire HPLC run of the
thermal depurination products from spleen DNA of a treated rat
(0.1 mg/kg) revealed a single discrete peak of radioactivity eluting

around 3.5 to 4.5 minutes (Fig. 1B, top trace), which corresponds in
retention time to the authentic N7-HEG standard (Fig. 1B, bottom
trace). As expected, no peaks due to excess radiocarbon were
evident in the reconstructed chromatogram from a control rat that
did not receive [14C]EO (middle trace).
The amount of [14C]N7-HEG in each spleen, stomach, and liver
DNA sample was determined by summation of the 14C content in
individual HPLC fractions comprising the adduct peak (Table 1).
Importantly, exogenous adduct formation was dose dependent in
all tissues (Fig. 1C) and modeling of the data revealed that the
response was significant for a linear relationship (P < 0.05) in all
three tissues, as opposed to the alternative hypothesis of a hockey
stick model, which did not explain a significantly greater
proportion of the variation. However, it should be appreciated
that because this study was not specifically designed to test for
linearity and some of the adduct levels induced at lower [14C]EO
concentrations are below the limit of quantitation (f20–50
adducts/1012 nucleotides), they may not be sufficiently accurate
to allow unambiguous establishment of a linear dose response.
Confirmation, or indeed rejection, of the prediction presented here

may be achieved by including additional low doses at 0.00025,
0.00075, 0.0025, and 0.0075 mg/kg, which are spaced well below that
p
of a multiple of 10.
At the lowest dose of 0.0001 mg/kg, no adducts were observed in
stomach DNA, indicating they were either not formed or perhaps
more likely were present at levels below the limit of detection
(which ranged from 4 to 10 adducts/1012 nucleotides). Statistical
analysis showed that the first significant (P < 0.05) increases in 14Clabeled exogenous adducts above background levels of radiocarbon
detected in control rats occurred at 0.005, 0.001, and 0.0005 mg/kg
for the liver, spleen, and stomach, respectively; the fact that these
values do not equate to the lowest dose can probably be attributed
to the relatively large interindividual variation. The biological risks
associated with these adducts can only be evaluated if the data
are viewed in a wider context, taking into account background
levels of this lesion.
Using our established LC-MS/MS assay for N7-HEG, it was
possible to accurately quantify the background (unlabeled) adduct
level in rat tissues, distinct from those formed as a consequence of
[14C]EO reacting with DNA. It is clearly evident from Fig. 2, which
displays the relative proportion of endogenously derived N7-HEG
and exogenous [14C]N7-HEG in tissues, that exogenous adducts
comprise a relatively small fraction of the total damage, especially
at doses V0.005 mg/kg, where [14C]N7-HEG accounts for <2% of
the total adducts detected and can be considered negligible. The
maximum proportion of exogenous adducts (29%) occurs in the
stomach after dosing with 0.1 mg/kg [14C]EO. However, given
the inherent variation in endogenous adduct levels among rats, it
is important to recognize that the increase in adducts caused by
direct binding of [14C]EO to DNA is not significant at any dose,
with the single exception of hepatic tissue of rats that received
0.05 mg/kg (P < 0.05). The important implications of this finding
are that exogenous N7-HEG formation may not pose any additional risk over and above that presented by the ubiquitous background damage, a suggestion that is reinforced when the results are
translated to humans. At doses of 0.05 mg/kg, which yields blood
concentrations of [14C]EO equivalents in the order of 22 pg/mg,
making it relevant to human occupational exposures (33), the
extent of [14C]N7-HEG formation in rat tissues was around 10 to
20 adducts/109 nucleotides; this is 5- to 100-fold lower than the
endogenous level of these adducts reported in WBCs isolated from
unexposed humans (16–18).
Interestingly, EO treatment did affect the total numbers of N7HEG lesions formed through an indirect mechanism, a phenomenon that has never before been observed. The background
abundance of endogenous N7-HEG in control untreated animals
was 24.2 F 6.9, 37.3 F 5.1, and 23.3 F 7.3 adducts/109 nucleotides
(mean F SD) in spleen, stomach, and liver, respectively, which
agrees with previous values obtained in rats (Fig. 2; ref. 26). At
doses up to and including 0.01 mg/kg, [14C]EO administration
had no significant effect on the presence of endogenous lesions.
However, at the two highest doses, endogenous (unlabeled) N7HEG formation in the spleen and liver was significantly higher than
levels in control animals, reaching 91.0 F 30.5 and 160.2 F 59.2
adducts/109 nucleotides in the spleen and 57.8 F 1.3 and 153.2 F
73.6 in the liver at 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg [14C]EO, respectively. This
suggests that exposure to EO induces physiologic pathways
responsible for ethylene generation in vivo and, as a consequence,
indirectly increases N7-HEG adduct levels.

in mammalian systems have not been directly determined.
Pathways frequently cited to account for the presence of N7-HEG
in animals and humans include oxidation of methionine, lipid
peroxidation, and the metabolizing activity of intestinal bacteria;
however, the underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated.
Methionine is undeniably a precursor of ethylene in plant tissues,
where the gas acts as an important hormone to regulate growth,
development, and senescence (19). In model in vitro systems, ethylene is produced from methionine in a process mediated by H2O2
generated in a reaction between cuprous ions, hydrogen ions, and
oxygen. Furthermore, tracer studies with [14C]methionine revealed
that carbons 3 and 4 of the amino acid were converted to ethylene
(34). Evidence for the role of lipid peroxidation in ethylene and EO
production is less defined but stems from observations that the
2-hydroxyethylvaline content in hemoglobin is higher in mice
fed unsaturated lipids compared with animals on a standard diet
(20). In addition, ethylene can be generated from peroxidized
linolenate in model systems containing Cu2+, oxygen, and ascorbic
acid (19) and in cell-free apple extracts in the presence of oxygen
and ascorbic acid (35). Crucially, however, when U-14C–labeled
linolenate was used as a substrate in similar model systems
with cauliflower, apple, or tomato slices, the 14C label was not
incorporated into ethylene, showing that linolenic acid itself
does not supply the two-carbon fragment of ethylene (36).

Dose-Response Relationships for EO DNA Adducts

Although a mechanism through which EO exposure might
enhance cellular levels of oxidative stress has not yet been defined,
evidence supports the possibility. Repeated exposure to EO elevates
lipid peroxidation in the liver of rats, an effect that has been
attributed to glutathione depletion (37). Interestingly, administration of ethylene glycol, a metabolite of EO produced by enzymatic
and spontaneous hydrolysis (32), also promotes lipid peroxidation
in vivo (38). Moreover, ethylene glycol free radical formation has
been shown to occur in a rat model of acute poisoning and it has
been suggested that lipid hydroperoxide–derived radicals are also
formed as a consequence of hydrogen abstraction, mediated by
peroxyl radicals produced from the reaction of 1,2-dihydroxyethyl
radicals with molecular oxygen (39). These considerations prompted us to investigate whether increased oxidative stress might
indirectly account for the elevated levels of endogenous N7-HEG
detected in rat spleen and liver.
When human HCA-7 colon cells were incubated in the presence
of H2O2 (50 and 100 Amol/L) as a source of reactive oxygen species
(ROS), there was a significant dose-related elevation in N7-HEG
quantified in the extracted DNA compared with control cells
(Fig. 3A). This effect was observed 4 hours after treatment
commenced, when mean adduct levels were f2- and 8-fold higher
than the background damage for 50 and 100 Amol/L H2O2, respectively, and was still visible at 24 hours, although to a slightly lesser
extent. This is the first direct evidence that exposure to ROS, in the
form of H2O2, can stimulate N7-HEG formation, presumably as a
consequence of EO production.
ACC as a precursor to EO in rat tissues and human cells. The
mechanism of ethylene biosynthesis in plants is relatively well
established and involves ACC as the immediate precursor. ACC is
liberated from methionine via S-adenosylmethionine in a reaction
that is catalyzed by ACC synthase in plants (40). It then undergoes
ACC oxidase-mediated two-electron oxidation in the presence of
dioxygen and a reductant to yield ethylene, CO2, and HCN. This
second reaction is inhibited by free radical scavengers (41) and

can also occur nonenzymatically in the presence of pyridoxal
phosphate, H2O2, and manganese or when a Cu(II)-ACC complex is
incubated with H2O2 alone (42, 43). Of particular relevance to
the current study is the fact that oxidation of linoleic acid by
lipoxygenase in the presence of ACC generates ethylene (44). The
mechanism is believed to involve generation of linoleic hydroperoxide, which is cleaved reductively to an alkoxy radical that reacts
with ACC via hydride abstraction, affording an amine radical cation
intermediate (45). From here, the precise sequence of events
leading to the release of ethylene is still under investigation. We
hypothesized that an analogous mechanism, depicted in Fig. 4,
occurs in mammalian cells, in which fatty acid peroxidation
induces ethylene production by supplying the alkoxy radical
necessary for activation of ACC. Hence any increase in intracellular
ROS or the substrates for oxidation, ACC or fatty acids, may result
in higher background N7-HEG levels. This theory explains how EO
exposure causes increased endogenous N7-HEG formation in rat
tissues and why administration of unsaturated lipids to mice has
previously been shown to cause elevated levels of 2-hydroxethylvaline adducts in hemoglobin (20), although lipids are not a direct
ethylene precursor. This premise was supported by the illustration
that treatment of HCA-7 cells with 1 mmol/L ACC for a week
significantly increased endogenous N7-HEG formation from 24 F
2.9 to 43 F 1.6 adducts/109 nucleotides (P < 0.0005; Fig. 3B).
Furthermore, the occurrence of CYP2E1 protein, the enzyme
required for metabolic conversion of ethylene to EO in humans,
was shown in HCA-7 cells by Western blotting, which revealed a
band at 55 kDa (Fig. 3C, lane 3), consistent with the expected
molecular weight and the baculovirus-expressed recombinant
human CYP2E1 standard in Fig. 3C (lane 2).
The outstanding question remaining was whether the vital
component of this system, ACC, occurs naturally in mammalian
cells. To our knowledge, this has never previously been reported;
therefore, using an ion exchange LC-MS/MS method adapted from
a published assay for ACC in plant tissue (46), we analyzed extracts

of rat liver and HCA-7 cells for the presence of endogenous ACC
(Fig. 5). Peaks with the same retention time as an authentic ACC
standard were detected in both tissue and cells using SRM for the
characteristic transition m/z 102!56, which corresponds to loss of
formic acid from the protonated molecular ion. For comparison
and to assess any matrix effects, a separate liver sample spiked
with ACC was also analyzed and gave identical results. Product ion
spectra obtained for each sample (see insets, Fig. 5) by selecting
m/z 102 as the parent ion and scanning from m/z 40 to 105
provided further confirmation that the peaks were due to ACC, as
all afforded similar spectra.
In summary, by using a dual-isotope approach combining HPLCAMS with LC-MS/MS analysis, we have provided evidence
supporting a linear dose-response relationship for the major EO
DNA adduct after exposure to low occupationally relevant doses.
More importantly, we have proven that the extent of damage
arising through this route is insignificant compared with the
background level of N7-HEG naturally present. As a direct
consequence of the analytic strategy used, it was possible to
detect a specific increase in endogenously derived N7-HEG caused
by EO exposure at the higher doses and we propose a novel
mechanism of adduct formation to account for this effect,
involving oxidative stress. N7-HEG is only one of a variety of
DNA adducts induced by oxidative stress, including many that are
promutagenic. Such lesions are very likely to contribute to the
background mutations that are involved in carcinogenesis. These
findings therefore have implications for human risk assessments
and suggest that N7-HEG adduct levels may have potential as a
biomarker of cellular oxidative stress.
The default position for many regulators when assessing the risk
from genotoxic carcinogens is to assume that there is no threshold

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (7). April 1, 2009

in the dose-response relationship and that even very low doses
cause an incremental risk. However, as shown here, if the
compound is produced endogenously, low doses of exogenous
exposure may be overwhelmed by the background levels, leading to
no detectable statistically significant increase in risk due to the
external exposure. To assess the importance of this phenomenon
to the regulation of EO exposures, it will firstly be essential to
determine the variation of N7-HEG levels in ‘‘unexposed’’ control
human populations and to identify the modulating factors for this
background. Similar studies on populations exposed to low levels
of exogenous EO would then enable determination of whether a
practical threshold exists and if a dose range could be established
for this. The presence of background levels of EO, and possibly
induced cancer risk, must be borne in mind when interpreting past
and future epidemiologic studies.
