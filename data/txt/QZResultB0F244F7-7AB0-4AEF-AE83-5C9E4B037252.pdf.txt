ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) carries a poor prognosis and continues to lack
effective treatments. Glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) drive tumor formation, invasion,
and drug resistance and, as such, are the focus of studies to identify new therapies
for disease control. Here, we identify the involvement of IKK and NF-κB signaling in
the maintenance of GSCs. Inhibition of this pathway impairs self-renewal as analyzed
in tumorsphere formation and GBM expansion as analyzed in brain slice culture.
Interestingly, both the canonical and non-canonical branches of the NF-κB pathway
are shown to contribute to this phenotype. One source of NF-κB activation in GBM
involves the TGF-β/TAK1 signaling axis. Together, our results demonstrate a role
for the NF-κB pathway in GSCs and provide a mechanistic basis for its potential as a
therapeutic target in glioblastoma.

INTRODUCTION

NF-κB is a family of transcription factors consisting
of five members: p65 (RelA), RelB, c-Rel, p105/p50,
and p100/p52 that homo- and heterodimerize to regulate
transcription of target genes. In the canonical pathway
under basal conditions, p65-p50 dimers are bound to
IκBα in the cytoplasm. Stimuli such as TNF-α or IL-1
lead to activation of the IKK complex, which consists
of two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, as well as a
scaffolding subunit, IKKγ or NEMO. IKK phosphorylates
IκBα, leading to its ubiquitination and proteasomal
degradation, which allows NF-κB to accumulate in the
nucleus. The non-canonical pathway is activated by
stimuli crucial for lymphoid development such as BAFF
or CD40. Here, the precursor p100 acts as an IκB molecule
bound to RelB. Upon activation, IKKα phosphorylates
p100, leading to its cleavage to produce p52. The active
RelB-p52 dimer can then regulate transcription of
target genes [15, 16]. Originally identified for its role in
inflammatory signaling, the NF-κB pathway has since
been demonstrated to be activated in various forms of

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most
common primary brain tumor in adults, but despite
multimodal treatment combining surgery, radiation, and
chemotherapy, the median survival for patients remains
under 15 months [1]. Pathologically, GBM is described
as a heterogeneous tumor type with high levels of
angiogenesis and invasion [2]. Recent studies provide
evidence for a population of cancer stem cells (CSCs)
within GBM contributing to this heterogeneity [3, 4].
These cells (hereafter called GSCs) carry neural stem cell
markers such as CD133, self-renew over serial passages,
and differentiate into multiple lineages. As with tumorinitiating cells described in other cancers [5-10], GSCs
have been shown to be invasive and resistant to both
radiation and chemotherapy [11-14]. As such, there is
significant interest in understanding the biology of the
GSC population to identify potential novel therapeutic
targets to improve disease control.

Our findings indicate that NF-κB signaling is a key
therapeutic target controlling GSCs.

cancer and is thought to contribute to the malignant
phenotype through dysregulation of important biological
processes such as proliferation, angiogenesis, apoptosis,
and cell survival [16-19].
Within the nervous system, NF-κB is typically
considered to be inactive, but activated in cases of injury
or inflammation, consistent with its canonical function in
other tissues [20, 21]. In normal neural stem cells (NSCs),
TNFα has been shown to induce proliferation through
NF-κB [22]. Kaus et al. [23] have shown that as NSCs
acquire the ability to proliferate independent of exogenous
growth factors, these cells demonstrate increased NF-κB
activity. In GBM, NF-κB has been reported to regulate
survival, invasion, and resistance to both radiation
and chemotherapy [24-28]. PTEN deletion and EGFR
amplification and/or mutation are two of the most
common genetic alterations in GBM and both can lead to
increased NF-κB activation [28, 29]. Additionally, TGF-β
signaling has been demonstrated to contribute to GSC
maintenance through the upregulation of LIF, Sox2, and
Sox4 [30, 31]. While the TGF-β and NF-κB pathways are
thought to antagonize each other in some settings, there
is evidence of their cooperation within tumors, including
GBM [32, 33]. Others have identified alterations in the
NF-κB pathway itself, with a subset of GBMs harboring
monoallelic NFKBIA (gene name for IκBα) deletions and
others expressing high levels of miR-30e* which targets
IκBα [34, 35]. Consistent with the involvement of NFκB signaling in GBM, recent work demonstrated that
treatment with a NEMO-binding domain (NBD) peptide
that blocks interactions between NEMO and IKKα/β
slowed tumor growth in both a human glioma xenograft
and a genetic mouse model of glioma [36].
NF-κB activity has been associated with CSCs in
several cancer [37-42], and in GBM the NF-κB targets
IL-6 and A20 have been shown to contribute to the
maintenance of GSCs [43, 44]. When cells are grown in
CSC-permissive conditions instead of monolayers, there
is an upregulation of NF-κB activity as seen through
p65 phosphorylation and target gene expression [45].
Other data suggest that inducing differentiation of GSCs
increases NF-κB activity. However, NF-κB inhibition
accelerates differentiation, suggesting a role for this
pathway in maintaining the cells in a more stem-like state
[46].
In this study, we sought to investigate the role
of the NF-κB pathway in GSCs directly. We find that
phosphorylation of the p65 (RelA) subunit of NF-κB is
elevated in CD133+ GBM cells as compared to CD133cells. Targeting NF-κB signaling either genetically or
pharmacologically impairs self-renewal in primary
tumorsphere assays and in limiting dilution assays.
Interestingly, both canonical and non-canonical NF-κB
pathways contribute to the GSC phenotype. Our results
indicate that one source of NF-κB activation in GSCs is a
TGF-β signaling pathway acting through TAK1. Using an

RESULTS
NF-κB is preferentially activated in CD133+ cells
of GBM explants
Given that NF-κB is not highly active in normal
brain tissue, we first compared the growth of normal
neural stem cells and astrocytes to that of patient-derived
GBM explant cultures. We treated cells with DMSO or
with the selective IKKβ antagonist Compound A [47]
daily for 5 days and measured cell viability by MTS
assay (Figure 1A). Results demonstrate that growth was
impaired in the GBM explant cultures by NF-κB inhibition
but not in the normal neural stem cell or astrocyte cultures,
suggesting that NF-κB inhibition preferentially targets
tumor cells over normal brain cells. Since GBM was one
of the first solid tumors in which CSCs were identified
[3, 4] and based on our previous work implicating NFκB signaling in breast CSCs [39], we next asked if these
findings could be explained by a role for NF-κB signaling
in the growth of GSCs. To study the stem cell-like vs.
non-stem cell-like subpopulation of glioblastoma cells,
we isolated CD133+ and CD133- fractions from the
human glioblastoma explant cultures using magnetic
beads. Interestingly, the CD133+ cells exhibited elevated
levels of p65 phosphorylation, consistent with increased or
altered activity of the canonical NF-κB pathway (Figure
1B).

Inhibition of NF-κB reduces tumorsphere
formation
We next examined whether NF-κB was important
in tumorsphere formation, which is an in vitro test
for stem cell-like activity. After isolation, CD133+
cells were plated at a low density and allowed to form
spheroids for one week prior to quantification. Daily
treatment with Compound A abrogated tumorsphere
formation completely. Importantly, a single treatment
with Compound A at the beginning of the experiment was
sufficient to reduce tumorsphere formation, suggesting
that even transient loss of NF-κB activity could affect
stem-like activity (Figure 2A, 2B). In order to further
address the effects on self-renewal, primary tumorspheres
from the first week of growth were dissociated, re-plated,
and then subjected to the same treatments. Treatment
with Compound A also reduced secondary tumorsphere
formation, again consistent with a role for NF-κB activity
in the stem-cell fraction (Figure 2C). Finally, we assayed

tumorsphere formation by using a limiting dilution assay
with a range of cell concentrations from 1-100 cell(s)/well.
For both 7030 and GBM6 CD133+ cells, treatment with
Compound A significantly reduced the ability of GBM
stem cells to form tumorspheres (Figure 2D, 2E).
In order to validate the on-target activity of
Compound A in inhibiting IKK, we repeated these assays
using siRNA-mediated knockdown of IKKβ and/or p65.
Knockdown of either protein resulted in a decrease in p65
phosphorylation, as well as a decrease in tumorsphere
formation (Figure 3A-3C). The inhibitory effects of
p65 knockdown were confirmed in the limiting dilution
assay consistent with previous results (Figure 3D). Taken
together, these results strongly implicate a role for the NFκB pathway in GSC propagation and self-renewal.

sought to determine if the non-canonical NF-κB pathway,
driven by a RelB-p52 dimer, could be contributing to GSC
maintenance as well. Accordingly, GBM6 CD133+ cells
were transfected with siRNAs targeting p65, p100/p52,
or RelB. Each of these subunits produced a substantial
decrease in tumorsphere formation in a limiting dilution
assay (Figure 4A). Knockdown efficiency was confirmed
through qPCR (Figure 4B). These results suggest that
both the canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways
contribute to GSC maintenance.
Consistent with the literature, knockdown of p65
resulted in decreased transcription of both RelB and
p100 [48, 49]. We found that knockdown of p65 and
IKKβ decreased expression of the non-canonical subunits
at the protein level as well (Figure 4C). Interestingly,
knockdown of IKKβ but not IKKα significantly decreased
tumorsphere formation in a limiting dilution assay (Figure
4D, 4E). Under normal culture conditions, no NIK
expression was detected even with the addition of the
proteasome inhibitor MG132. Perhaps not surprisingly,
we did not see consistent results when attempting to
knockdown NIK and assay tumorsphere formation (data

not shown). It is possible that the residual IKKα following
siRNA knockdown is sufficient for p100 processing to p52
and that a more complete knockout would reveal a larger
effect for IKKα. Alternatively, p100 could be functioning
in a separate role rather than simply being the precursor to
p52, which is what is being observed in these experiments.
These possibilities are further explored in the discussion.
Nonetheless, these results suggest that transcriptional
regulation of the non-canonical subunits (RelB and p100)
by the canonical subunit (p65) could be a significant
aspect of non-canonical pathway regulation in GSCs.

Next, we examined an upstream activator of the
NF-κB pathway, transforming growth factor-β-activated
kinase 1 (TAK1), which is known to activate the IKK
complex following cytokine stimulation as well as in
some oncogenic settings [50-54]. We first showed that
use of two structurally distinct TAK1 inhibitors ((5Z)7-oxozeanol and NG-25) decreased the expression of an
NF-κB luciferase reporter in both GBM explant cultures

(Figure 5A). In tumorsphere formation assays, treatment
with either (5Z)-7-oxozeanol or NG-25 decreased
tumorsphere formation in GBM 7030 CD133+ cells with
a single treatment and to an even greater extent with daily

limiting dilution assays, finding that both siRNA against
TAK1 and the TAK1 inhibitors resulted in significant
decreases in tumorsphere formation (Figure 5C, 5D).

TGF-β and NF-κB in the setting of GBM. Studies showed
that treatment with exogenous TGF-β led to an increase
in Smad phosphorylation (as expected) and in p65
phosphorylation in GBM explant cultures (Figure 6A).
Conversely, addition of a TGF-βR1 inhibitor (SB431542)
led to a decrease in p65 phosphorylation (Figure 6B).
Additionally, the TGF-βR1 inhibitor induced a small but
consistent decrease in luciferase activity from an NF-κB
reporter in GBM explant cultures (Figure 6C). Together,
these results suggest an autocrine/paracrine role for TGF-β
in maintaining NF-κB signaling in these GBM explant
cultures. Use of the TGF-βR1 inhibitor in a tumorsphere
assay leads to a significant decrease in tumorsphere
formation in GBM6 CD133+ cells (Figure 6D). These
results suggest that TGF-β can activate NF-κB signaling
in these GBM explants. However, given the scale of these

were sectioned into 250 μm coronal slices, then plated
on top of an agar medium as previously described [57].
GBM6-GFP spheres were then engrafted onto the upper
surfaces of these these brain slice explants shortly after
slicing. A first round of imaging was then completed
within a few hours of plating to establish a baseline for
GBM tumor growth these brain slices. The brain slices
were then imaged daily for up to eight days and the GFPpositive areas were quantified for each slice and on each
day using ImageJ software. Representative images show
that implanted GBM tumorspheres progressively grow and
invade the surrounding brain tissues over the course of the
experiment (Figure 7A).

changes, it is likely only one of several sources of NF-κB
activation, consistent with the pleiotropic nature of this
pathway. Similarly, given the more drastic effects seen in
the tumorsphere assay with the TGF-βR1 inhibitor, it is
likely that the TGF-β pathway is also mediating additional
factors involved in GSC biology.

chemotherapy [3, 4, 11-14]. It is crucial to investigate
the signaling pathways responsible for these phenotypic
differences from the bulk of the tumor, both to establish
insight into mechanisms that promote these cells and
to potentially identify therapeutic targets for disease
control. In this study, we demonstrate the involvement
of the IKK/NF-κB pathway in the function of GSCs.
We identified a TGF-β/TAK1 axis as one source of NFκB activation in these cells. TAK1 is a well-established
activator of IKK and there is a precedent for cooperation
between the TGF-β and NF-κB pathways in GBM [32,
33]. Nonetheless, it is likely that other sources for NF-κB
activation exist, such as cytokines, which utilize TAK1
as a mediator of NF-κB activation. Indeed, common
genetic alterations seen in GBM (PTEN deletion, EGFR
amplification and mutation, and monoallelic NFKBIA
deletion) have all been connected to enhanced NF-κB
activation [28, 34, 58-63]. Our data from the ex vivo coculture experiments show greater effects following IKK

were transfected with either control or p65 siRNA twentyfour hours prior to tumorsphere formation and brain
slice implantation. Quantification of tumorsphere crosssectional areas indicated that transfection with p65 siRNA
significantly inhibited the growth rate of the implanted
GBM tumorspheres over the course of the experiment
(Figure 7B). Similarly, addition of the IKKβ inhibitor to
the implanted brain slice cultures also led to significant
inhibition of GBM tumorsphere growth (Figure 7C, 7D).

DISCUSSION
As with many other tumor types, glioblastoma
is characterized by a hierarchical organization of cells,
including a subpopulation of so-called cancer stem cells
(or tumor-initiating cells). These cells promote tumor
initiation and recurrence, drive invasion and metastasis,
and demonstrate increased resistance to radiation and

inhibition in the whole slice rather than just the cancer
cells. Given the extensive number of cytokines and
chemokines regulated by NF-κB, it is very likely that
this pathway impacts the interactions between the tumor,
microglia, and infiltrating immune cells, potentially
related to the finding that GSCs promote tumor evasion via
immunosuppression [64, 65]. Consistent with our studies
overall, Verma and colleagues showed that treatment with
an NBD peptide impaired tumor growth in both a human
glioma xenograft and a genetic mouse model of glioma
[36], focusing on inhibition of canonical NF-κB signaling
through disruption of the IKK complex. Thus, the effects
of IKK inhibition in GBM models may function, at least
partly, at the level of GSCs.
As a family of transcription factors, the NF-κB
pathway is likely mediating a variety of downstream
effects in GBM cells. We found that both the canonical
and non-canonical branches contribute to GSC biology.
Our results show larger effects of targeting RelB and
p100 compared to IKKα, as well as decreased expression

of the non-canonical subunits following knockdown of
p65. One possibility is that since siRNA knockdown is
incomplete, the remaining IKKα is still capable of driving
sufficient processing of p100 into p52 and that use of a
CRISPR knockout would produce a more substantial
phenotype. Alternatively, since p52 is generated from
p100 protein, knockdown at the gene level affects both
p100 and p52 levels. Thus, we could actually be observing
an independent effect of loss of p100 that is not dependent
on IKKα for processing into the active p52 subunit. For
example, a recent report demonstrated that p100 can
interact with ERK2 and inhibit its nuclear localization
[66], providing a precedent for p100-specific activities.
At this point, it is still unknown whether these two
pathways are acting on common or separate targets. The
dimerization and DNA binding patterns of NF-κB subunits
remain complex areas of study [67-72]. The non-canonical
pathway has been shown to have distinct functions in
oncogenesis, such as driving growth and invasion of
mesenchymal glioma and regulation of the mutant C250T

TERT promoter [73, 74]. Antagonism of p53 through
NF-κB regulation of Mdm2 expression has been wellestablished and can contribute to chemotherapy resistance
[75-77]. Additionally, NF-κB is known to regulate target
genes related to several GSC functions including survival
(BCL2, BCL2L1), invasion (IL6, IL8, CCL2, MMP2/3/9),
and resistance to therapy (MGMT, TNFAIP3, TRADD) [7885]. Gene expression analysis showed NF-κB regulation
of some of these targets, however neither the expression
nor the NF-κB-dependency was limited to the CD133+
population of cells. It is likely that the effects on GSCs
observed following NF-κB inhibition result from a
combination of these and other genes. Given its central
position in GSC signaling, the IKK/NF-κB pathway
is proposed as a target for therapeutic intervention in
glioblastoma.

Cell culture, CD133+ isolation, and reagents
The human glioblastoma explants (6969, 7030,
7063, and GBM6) were obtained from UCSF and
maintained in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen),
supplemented with B27 without Vitamin A, L-glutamine,
20ng/mL EGF, 40ng/mL FGF, and penicillin/streptomycin.
To dissociate tumorspheres, cells were incubated with
Accutase (Sigma) in a 37°C water bath for 10 minutes,
then plated as desired. To isolate CD133+ cells, cells were
dissociated with Accutase and passed over a pre-separation
filter to achieve single cell suspension. Dead cells were
removed using the Dead Cell Removal Kit according
to manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi). Remaining
cells were incubated with CD133 magnetic microbeads
(Miltenyi) for 30 minutes, resuspended in MACS buffer
and passed over two LS columns consecutively. Nonretained cells were saved for the CD133- fraction. After

(M-003473-02), IKBKB (M-003503-03), MAP3K7 (M003790-06), or control #3 (D001201-03) was purchased
from Thermo/Dharmafect. DharmaFECT reagent 1
was used to transfect siRNA into cells according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Six hours post-transfection,
the media was changed on the cells. Cells were harvested
48-72 hours post-transfection for analysis by quantitative
real-time PCR or Western blot.

3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2Htetrazolium cellular proliferation assay

Quantitative real-time PCR

Cells were seeded at 2000 or 3000 cells per
well in 96-well plates, then treated with DMSO or
Compound A daily as indicated. At each time point,
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium
(MTS)
compound (Promega) was added and absorbance was read
at 490 nm on a Versamax Microplate Reader (Molecular
Devices).

RNA extracts were obtained from cells using the
RNeasy Plus Kit (Qiagen). Two micrograms of RNA
were reverse transcribed using random primers and
MMLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR
was performed using Taqman Gene Expression Assay
primer-probe sets for GUSB (Hs99999908_m1), RELA
(Hs00153294_m1), RELB (Hs00232399_m1), NFKB2
(Hs01028901_g1), CHUK (Hs00989502_m1), and
IKBKB (Hs00233287_m1) and relative quantification was
determined using the ΔΔCt method.

Luciferase assay
Cells were transfected with 3x-κB luciferase reporter
plasmid [88] using FuGENE HD (Promega). Six hours
post-transfection, cells were separated into 12-well plates
and treated in duplicate with inhibitors as indicated for 24
hours. Cells were lysed in 150 μL of Passive Lysis Buffer,
then 20 μL of lysate was used for analysis in triplicate
using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Luciferase
signal was read on a Synergy2 plate reader (Biotek), and
then normalized to protein content of each well based on
a Bradford assay.

Tumorsphere and limiting dilution assays
For tumorsphere assays, cells were dissociated into
single cell suspension using Accutase. Cells were counted
and plated at 100 cells per well in 24-well tissue culture
plates. Cells were treated with inhibitors as indicated
(once or daily for the duration of the experiment): 5
μM Compound A, 2.5 μM (5Z)-7-oxozeanol (Tocris), 2
μM NG25 (MedChem Express), and 10 μM SB431542
(Tocris). Following one week of growth, tumorspheres
were viewed on the microscope and quantified. For
limiting dilution assays, cells were serially diluted to be
plated at 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2 or 1 cell(s)/well in 96-well
plates. After one week of growth, wells were scored for
the presence or absence of spheres. Extreme limiting
dilution analysis was performed as previously described
[89], using software available at http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/
software/elda/.

Western blotting
Whole cell extracts were prepared by collecting
cells, washing with cold PBS, then suspending in cold
lysis buffer (1% NP-40, 20 mM Tris, 138 mM NaCl,
2mM EDTA, 10% glycerol) on ice for 10 minutes,
followed by 10 minutes of centrifugation to remove
insoluble components. Protein was quantitated by
Bradford assay (Biorad). Equal amounts of lysate (2550 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked for 1 hour in
5% milk. Membranes were incubated with primary
antibody overnight at 4°C, then incubated with secondary
antibody for 1 hour at room temperature and developed
using ECL reagent (GE). Antibodies used were phosphoSmad2/3 (S465, 467/S423, 425), phospho-p65 (S536),
p65, IKKβ, RelB (Cell Signaling Technology), IKKα,
p100/p52 (Millipore), TAK1 and β-tubulin (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology).

Brain slice explantation and tumorsphere
implantation
Coronal brain slices (250 μm thick) from postnatal
day 10 Sprague-Dawley rat pups of either sex (Charles
River, Wilmington, MA) were prepared and explanted in
organotypic culture as previously described [57]. Animals
were sacrificed in accordance with NIH guidelines and
under Duke IACUC approval and oversight. Briefly, brain

tissues were sliced in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal
fluid and plated in interface configuration atop culture
medium (Neurobasal A medium supplemented with
15% heat-inactivated horse serum, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM
HEPES, 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 1 mM sodium
pyruvate, and 1 mM L-glutamine) semi-solidified in
0.5% reagent-grade agarose in 12-well plates. Brain slice
explants were incubated under 5% CO2 at 37 ºC for up to
8 days as indicated. Compound A or DMSO-only vehicle
was added to culture medium at the time of brain slice
explantation. Small groups of GBM tumorspheres were
implanted shortly thereafter by direct application to the
upper surfaces of each brain slice. An epifluorescence
stereomicroscope was used to obtain images through the
course of experiments. ImageJ was used to quantify the
area of GFP+ cells.
