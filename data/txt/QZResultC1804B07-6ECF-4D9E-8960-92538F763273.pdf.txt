BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to define the volumetric tumor growth rate in patients who had advanced nonsmall
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with sensitizing epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and had initially received treatment
with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy beyond progression. METHODS: The study included 58 patients with advanced
NSCLC who had sensitizing EGFR mutations treated with first-line gefitinib or erlotinib, had baseline computed tomography (CT)
scans available that revealed a measurable lung lesion, had at least 2 follow-up CT scans during TKI therapy, and had experienced volumetric tumor growth. The tumor volume (in mm3) of the dominant lung lesion was measured on baseline and follow-up CT scans
during therapy. In total, 405 volume measurements were analyzed in a linear mixed-effects model, fitting time as a random effect, to
define the growth rate of the logarithm of tumor volume (logeV). RESULTS: A linear mixed-effects model was fitted to predict the
growth of logeV, adjusting for time in months from baseline. LogeV was estimated as a function of time in months among patients
whose tumors started growing after the nadir: logeV 5 0.12*time 1 7.68. In this formula, the regression coefficient for time, 0.12=month,
represents the growth rate of logeV (standard error, 0.015=month; P <.001). When adjusted for baseline volume, logeV0, the growth
rate was also 0.12=month (standard error, 0.015=month; P <.001; logeV 5 0.12*months 1 0.72 logeV0 1 0.61). CONCLUSIONS: Tumor volume models defined volumetric tumor growth after the nadir in patients with EGFR-mutant, advanced NSCLC who were receiving
TKI, providing a reference value for the tumor growth rate in patients who progress after the nadir on TKI therapy. The results can be
studied further in additional cohorts to develop practical criteria to help identify patients who are slowly progressing and can safely

INTRODUCTION
The characterization of genomic abnormalities in lung cancers in the past decade has transformed the way oncologists
approach and treat patients with lung cancer. This is demonstrated best by the discovery and clinical application of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation testing in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is associated with a
dramatic radiographic response to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib.1-3 Patients
with NSCLC who harbor EGFR sensitizing mutations have response rates >70%, and their progression-free survival
ranges from 9.7 to 13.1 months when they receive EGFR-TKIs.4-10 However, virtually all patients who have an initial
response eventually progress because of the development of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs, and patients demonstrate
radiographic tumor growth during TKI therapy.11-15
Oncologists have used linear measurements defined according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) as a guide to define response and progression and to determine when to switch therapy or add another agent.16-18
However, recent clinical observations have indicated that the conventional RECIST-based assessment alone does not fully
characterize response and progression in genomically characterized patients who have specific tumor types, including

gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), melanoma, and
lung cancers treated with targeted therapies.19-22 New radiographic response criteria have been proposed, such as
Choi criteria for GISTs using computed tomography (CT)
density and immune-related response criteria for melanoma, in which a response may be observed after an initial
increase in tumor burden.19-22
Thoracic oncologists continue to allow patients who
have NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations to receive
EGFR-TKIs beyond RECIST progression, because their
tumors tend to grow slowly, and the patients remain
asymptomatic, suggesting that some tumor cells remain
sensitive to TKIs.23-25 Nishie et al demonstrated that continuous EGFR-TKI after progression was associated with
improved overall survival compared with switching to
chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio, 0.42).26 EGFR-TKIs
are associated with improved quality of life and less toxicity compared with chemotherapy.7-10 The benefit of
EGFR-TKIs should be maximized by adequately prolonging the duration of TKI therapy. A previous study by our
group examined patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR
mutations who had received a first-line TKI in which
88% of patients continued on TKI beyond RECIST progression, indicating that RECIST progression is not the
single determining factor for terminating TKI.25 There is
a clear need for additional radiographic criteria of tumor
growth beyond RECIST progression to better guide therapeutic decisions.
One of the major limitations of RECIST is the use
of the cutoff value of tumor size increase to define progression, which does not incorporate the changes in tumor burden over time or the tumor growth rate. Tumor
volume measurement using multidetector-row CT has
been studied to complement the limitations of RECIST.
Tumor volume measurements in NSCLC are feasible
with higher reproducibility than size measurements.27-31
We previously established a CT tumor volumetry technique in advanced NSCLC using US Food and Drug
Administration-approved software.31 The study demonstrated that tumor volume was more reproducible than
size, consistent with other studies.27-31 Volume assessment also has been used to predict outcome in patients
with NSCLC who received chemotherapy and chest
radiotherapy.32-34 In patients with advanced NSCLC
who had sensitizing EGFR mutations, a tumor volume
decrease at 8 weeks of EGFR-TKI therapy was associated
with longer survival.35 However, a detailed characterization of volumetric tumor growth rate in patients with
EGFR-mutant NSCLC after initial response to EGFRTKI therapy has not been systematically performed.

Tumor growth is based on a specific relation
between tumor volume and time, and comprehensive
equations of tumor growth have been pursued extensively
in past decades. One of the well studied models is the
Gompertzian model, which was described initially by
Gompertz in 1825 to deal with human mortality and,
unexpectedly, was identified later as useful for describing
biologic tumor growth.36-38 Tumor growth according to
the Gompertzian model has an exponential nature at the
early stage and subsequently saturates, approaching a plateau as tumor increases.37 Although the growth of most
untreated tumors has been well described by the Gompertzian equation, the growth of treated tumors presents
another investigational challenge.37-39 In the late 1970s,
Looney et al quantitatively evaluated tumor growth curves
in rat hepatoma during radiotherapy and chemotherapy,
attempting to more precisely evaluate therapeutic effects,
improve therapeutic scheduling, and better understand
tumor biology.40-42 Those studies, performed more than
3 decades ago, although technologically different, share
similar concepts with the current study, in that they
focused on the tumor growth rate during therapy to
improve response assessment and therapeutic decisions.
The objective of the current study was to analyze the volumetric tumor growth rate in patients with advanced
NSCLC who had sensitizing EGFR mutations after they
reached their volume nadir during EGFR-TKI therapy as
an initial step in developing radiographic criteria for slow
progression to aid in therapeutic decision making.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

The study population included 58 patients who had stage
IV NSCLC (according to the seventh edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Cancer Staging Manual) or
stage I through IIIA NSCLC with systemic relapse and sensitizing EGFR mutations and who received gefitinib or erlotinib as initial systemic therapy for advanced NSCLC
between February 2002 and May 2011 at the Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute. The patients had baseline CT scans that
demonstrated at least 1 measurable lung lesion (10 mm
in greatest diameter), at least 2 follow-up CT scans during
EGFR-TKI therapy, and experienced volumetric tumor
growth during TKI therapy. Patients provided informed
consent, and their records were retrospectively reviewed
with institutional review board approval.
Mutation Analysis

Tumor specimens were obtained from diagnostic or surgical procedures. Samples consisted of frozen tumor

specimens or paraffin-embedded material. EGFR exons
18 through 21 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and were analyzed bidirectionally by direct sequencing for the presence of somatic mutations.1,2 The
following EGFR mutations were considered sensitizing:
deletions, duplications, and deletion-insertions of
exon19, L858R point mutation, L861Q point mutation,
and G719 missense point mutations.25,43,44
Tumor Volume Measurements

Baseline and follow-up CT scans were performed to determine response to EGFR-TKI using the clinical chest CT
protocol.31 Follow-up CT scans were performed every 8
weeks for 33 patients who were enrolled on prospective
trials of EGFR-TKIs and at the discretion of the treating
providers for 25 patients who received treatment off protocol.5,25,45-47 A thoracic radiologist (M.N.) measured
the volume of a dominant, measurable lung lesion (1
lesion per patient) on baseline and all CT scans during
EGFR-TKI monotherapy using previously validated, US
Food and Drug Administration-approved volume analysis
software (Vitrea 2; Vital Images, Minnetonka, Minn).31
We used this technique based on our previously published
data indicating its high interobserver reproducibility, in
which tumor volume measurements were more reproducible than size measurements.31 The nadir (the smallest tumor volume recorded from baseline to TKI
termination=last follow-up) was determined for each
patient.
Statistical Analysis

In total, 405 volume measurements from the nadir to the
end of TKI therapy=last follow-up, with data closure on
June 1, 2012, were analyzed. Demographics and disease
characteristics were summarized with descriptive statistics.
A linear mixed-effects model, fitting time as a random
effect,48 was fitted to the repeated measures of volume
data to estimate the effect of time and other prognostic
factors on tumor growth. The tumor volume (mm3) was
transformed to the natural logarithm scale, and the logarithm of tumor volume (logeV) was used. The first model
was built adjusting only for time in months from baseline.
Because the baseline volume (logeV0; the tumor volume
measured on the baseline scan performed before the initiation of TKI therapy) may influence the tumor volume
and its growth rate, the second model was adjusted for
time and logeV0. The third model was adjusted for time,
for logeV0, and for the clinical characteristics listed in Table 1 to determine whether clinical variables had a significant effect on tumor growth.

RESULTS
Patients

Table 1 summarizes the patient and disease characteristics.
The median time on TKI monotherapy was 15.8 months.
The median number of follow-up scans was 7.5 (range, 235 scans). The median time from baseline to tumor volume nadir was 6.3 months.
Volumetric Tumor Growth Rate

Figure 1 illustrates the volumetric tumor growth of 58
patients from their nadir to the termination of therapy or
the last follow-up scan. A linear mixed-effects model was
fitted to predict the growth of logeV, adjusting for time
from baseline.
In the first model, logeV was estimated as a function
of the time from baseline, and the following equation was
obtained: logeV 5 0.12*time 1 7.68.
3763

Original Article

Figure 1. This spider plot represents volumetric tumor growth curves of the 58 patients after they reached their volume nadir.
LogeV indicates the logarithm of tumor volume.

In this equation, time represents the number of
months from baseline. The regression coefficient for time,
0.12=month, represents the growth rate of logeV (standard error, 0.015, P < 0.001).
The second model was adjusted for logeV0 as a fixed
effect, and logeV was estimated as follows:
logeV 5 0.12*time 1 0.72 logeV0 1 0.61.
LogeV0 was a significant predictor of the volume after nadir (P < .001), with a coefficient of 0.72. The
growth rate of logeV, obtained as a coefficient for time,
was 0.12=month (standard error, 0.015, P < 0.001) after
adjusting for logeV0. Therefore, the growth rate was
0.12=month for logeV, regardless of the baseline volume.
In the third model, which was adjusted for the clinical
variables and for logeV0, stage at diagnosis (stage IV vs
others), TKI (gefitinib or erlotinib), and smoking status
(current=former vs never smoker) were significant predictors of the volume after nadir, along with logeV0 (P < .001
for logeV0; P 5 .08 for stage; P 5 .04 for TKI; and P 5 .04
for smoking). The following equation was obtained:
logeV 5 0.12*time 1 0.64 logeV0 1 0.83; *stage 1 1.00*
TKI 1 0.54*smoking 1 0.34.
In this equation, stage was scored as 1 for stage
IV and 0 for stages I through III, TKI was scored
as 1 for gefitinib and 0 for erlotinib, and smoking
status was scored as 1 for current=former smokers
and 0 for never smokers. The growth rate of logeV
3764

again was 0.12=month (standard error, 0.01,
P < 0.001). Stage, TKI, and smoking status affected
the extent of tumor volume; however, the tumor
growth rate was 0.12=month for logeV regardless of
these clinical characteristics or the baseline volume.
Threshold for Volumetric Tumor Growth

To explore criteria for tumor growth that were appropriate for identifying which patients could safely continue to
receive an EGFR-TKI, the threshold of the growth rate of
logeV >0.15=month was proposed based on the rate
obtained from the equations (0.12=month) plus twice the
standard error, 0.015=month (0.12 1 0.015 3 250.15),
representing the upper 95% confidence interval for the
rate. We calculated the growth rate of logeV between 2
consecutive scans after nadir and investigated 2 consecutive occurrences of the growth rate of logeV
>0.15=month during EGFR-TKI therapy in all 58
patients.
Fourteen of 58 patients (24%) experienced a
growth rate of logeV >0.15=month on 2 consecutive
scans, which occurred after nadir in all patients (Figs.
2,3). The median time from baseline to the second scan
with a rate >0.15=month was 9.7 months (range, 3.120.7 months). The median time on TKI in these 14
patients was 11.7 months, compared with 17.9 months
in 44 patients who did not experience a rate

IV lung adenocarcinoma with fast tumor growth. (A) The baseline CT scan revealed a dominant mass in the right lower lobe
measuring 25,016 mm3. (B) The patient received treatment with erlotinib. At 4 months of therapy, the tumor volume significantly
decreased and reached the nadir, measuring 5288 mm3. (C) At 5 months, the tumor started to grow back and measured 7490

0.22 per month. (D) At 7 months, the tumor volume further increased, measuring 12,922 mm3. The growth rate of logeV based on
the previous scan was 0.33 per month. One week later, erlotinib was discontinued, and the patient subsequently received
platinum-based chemotherapy.

patients (43%), TKI monotherapy was terminated
within 1 month from the second scan, and there were
no further CT scans before therapy termination. The
other 8 patients (57%) remained on TKI monotherapy
beyond the second scan and had at least 1 additional
chest CT scan while receiving TKI.

DISCUSSION
The current study provided the volumetric tumor growth
rate after nadir in patients with EGFR-mutant, advanced
NSCLC who were receiving TKI therapy. The result provides a reference value for the tumor growth rate in
patients who progress on TKIs. This growth rate can be
studied further in additional cohorts and may help in the

development of practical criteria with which to identify
patients who can safely remain on EGFR-TKIs. To our
knowledge, this is the first report providing a reference
value of volumetric tumor growth in a genomically
defined cohort of patients with advanced NSCLC who
received targeted therapy.
The conventional RECIST-based assessment has
limitations in characterizing tumor response and guiding
therapeutic decisions in genomically selected cohorts of
patients receiving targeted therapy.19-24 One of the major
limitations of RECIST is that it does not take into
account tumor growth dynamics or the tumor growth
rate, which can be an important factor for characterizing
the anticancer activity of targeting agents.49
Characterizing tumor growth rates has been a challenging topic for cancer researchers. Since the 1970s, various studies have attempted to characterize tumor growth
dynamics of untreated and treated tumors to better understand solid tumor biology and improve therapeutic management.37-42 Recently, the concept of tumor growth rate
during anticancer treatment was studied in a trial of
patients with solid tumors to define the optimal trial endpoint.49,50 Gomez-Roca et al studied 76 patients with
solid tumors who were treated on phase 1 trials, including
patients with NSCLC (n 5 21), and used tumor volume
estimated from tumor size. In that study, the tumor
growth rate, obtained as log10(Vt=V0)=dt, decreased by
40% during treatment compared with the pretreatment
rate, suggesting that integration of the tumor growth rate
may improve the assessment of treatment efficacy.50
Others studied patients with renal cell carcinoma or prostate cancer and demonstrated that the growth rate constant, obtained as loge2=doubling time using tumor size,
was negatively correlated with overall survival.51,52
Those prior studies support the finding that the tumor growth rate adds potentially useful information for
assessing response and predicting outcome. The current
study focused on patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC
who were receiving TKI, because we believe that the tumor growth rate and its threshold for fast growth versus
slow growth are cohort-specific and therapy-specific. We
used CT tumor volume measurements rather than tumor
size. We chose this approach because we have demonstrated that tumor volume measurement is more reproducible than size measurement and detects smaller
changes more accurately.31 In addition, our group’s previous study demonstrated that a tumor volume decrease at 8
weeks of EGFR-TKI therapy was associated with longer
survival in patients with EGFR-mutant, advanced
NSCLC; whereas tumor size was not associated with sur3766

vival.35 To our knowledge, such an approach in this
highly specific, genomically defined cohort has never been
performed to address the issue of tumor growth rate.
The initial model adjusting for time from baseline
alone provided a growth rate of 0.12=month. The
growth rate adjusting for time and baseline volume also
was 0.12=month, indicating that the baseline volume
does influence tumor size at each time point after nadir,
although it does not have much effect on the pace of tumor growth; the tumors in our cohort grew at an overall
rate of 0.12=month for logeV after their nadir, regardless
of their baseline volume. This result is consistent with
our prior observation that baseline volume was not associated with survival in patients with EGFR-mutant
NSCLC who were receiving EGFR-TKIs.35 The growth
rate also was 0.12=month when the analysis was adjusted
for clinical variables, demonstrating the stability of the
model. The model and the consistency of the growth rate
of 0.12=month need to be validated in a larger, independent cohort of patients with sensitizing EGFR mutations who received TKIs to determine whether the
consistent results either are caused by an artifact of the
model fitting or truly reflect the biologically driven
behavior of EGFR-mutated tumor.
Our goal was to identify a cutoff value capable of
differentiating patients who are slowly progressing and
can safely remain on EGFR-TKI therapy. The upper
limit of the 95% confidence interval for the rate,
0.15=month, was used because it is often used to determine outliers in tumor volume studies and in growth
models.51 We investigated the occurrence of 2 consecutive observations of a rate >0.15=month; only 1 observation may be the result of measurement variability rather
than true tumor change, and clinicians tend to give the
“benefit of the doubt” and confirm observations on 1
more scan(s) before making decisions. The concept of
confirmation is well established in RECIST and is given
more emphasis in immune-related response criteria, in
which confirmation is required for progression.16-19
Two consecutive events of a growth rate
>0.15=month occurred after the volume nadir in all 14
patients, which is reassuring. The time on TKI was shorter
in these 14 patients than in the 44 patients who did not
have such events, indicating that the events did not happen by chance. Information about the tumor growth rate
was not available for the providers who treated these
patients. It is necessary to validate the model in an independent cohort to apply the threshold prospectively.
Limitations of the current study include a retrospective design and a small number of patients treated at a

single institution. Currently, we are planning to expand
the cohort and validate our results in an independent
cohort to establish practical criteria. The tumor volume
was measured in 1 dominant lung lesion per patient, and
smaller lung lesions or extrapulmonary lesions were not
included, which is another limitation. We designed the
study in this way because we believe tumor volume analysis should be additive to the evaluation of systemic tumor
burden by RECIST-based approach and by clinical assessment.20,35 An ongoing, multicenter, phase 2 trial
(National Clinical Trials identifier NCT01310036; the
ASPIRATION study) allows continuation of erlotinib
beyond RECIST-progressive disease (PD) at the investigator’s discretion. Scenarios in which erlotinib may be
continued include PD after >6 months of partial response=stable disease, asymptomatic minimal PD, or new
brain metastasis controlled locally. Scenarios in which
erlotinib should be discontinued are symptomatic extracranial PD, rapid PD and=or worsening of performance
status, or life-threatening complications.53 The objective
of our current analysis was to provide a quantitative reference value that can be used along with these clinical criteria to better aid therapeutic decisions and maximize the
benefits of effective targeted therapy.
In conclusion, the tumor volume analysis was able
to define volumetric tumor growth after the nadir in
patients with EGFR-mutant, advanced NSCLC who were
receiving EGFR-TKI. The study provided a reference
value for the tumor growth rate in patients who progress
after the nadir during TKI therapy. Further investigation
is warranted to validate these results and to develop practical radiographic criteria that can help identify patients as
slow progressors who can safely remain on EGFR-TKIs.
