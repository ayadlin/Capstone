BACKGROUND. The tumor suppressor gene PTEN is a major negative regulator of
the PI3K/Akt cellular survival pathway. Overexpression of PTEN by adenoviral
transfection increases doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Whereas doxorubicininduced apoptosis can be potentiated by the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA), the mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear.
The aim of this work was to investigate whether changes in PTEN expression are
involved in TSA/doxorubicin-induced apoptosis.

METHODS. We treated 293 T cells with TSA and doxorubicin, detected apoptosis

by using Hoechst 33342 staining, and examined changes of PTEN and Egr-1
expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Luciferase
reporter assay was used to evaluate the promoter activity of PTEN and Western
blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to confirm
changes in the expression of PTEN. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
assay was performed to estimate the acetylation level of PTEN promoter.

RESULTS. Doxorubicin-induced apoptosis was enhanced by TSA, whereas small
interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting PTEN inhibited TSA/doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Also, TSA promoted Egr-1 expression, which is the main transcription
factor of PTEN, and this resulted in up-regulation of PTEN expression, which
consequently potentiated apoptosis. Moreover, histone acetyltransferase p300
was able to synergistically activate PTEN transcription with Egr-1, implicating the
role of histone acetylation in the regulation of PTEN expression.

CONCLUSIONS. TSA promoted doxorubicin-induced apoptosis through a mechanism that involved the stimulation of Egr-1 expression, acetylation of core histones at the PTEN promoter, and consequently induction of PTEN transcription.

the overexpression of PTEN via adenoviral transfection (Ad.PTEN) together with doxorubicin brought
about a promoted therapeutic effect on prostate cancer.5 As a cancer chemotherapeutic agent used in
treatments of a variety of solid tumors, osteosarcomas, and soft-tissue sarcomas, doxorubicin can intercalate into DNA molecules and alter their helical
torsion resulting in DNA damage.6–8
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors such as
Trichostatin A (TSA) have emerged as accessory therapeutic agents for multiple human cancers. These
HDAC inhibitors can induce transcriptional activation of target genes through reducing HDAC activity
and hence affecting acetylation status of core histones. Studies revealed that HDAC inhibitors can
induce tumor growth arrest and promote differentiation or apoptosis in a variety of cell lines.9,10 It was
reported that treatment of cells with TSA before exposure to doxorubicin enhanced the sensitivity of apoptosis in K562 cells11 and in anaplastic thyroid
carcinoma (ATC).12
The immediate early growth response-1 (Egr-1)
gene encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that
binds to a GC-rich consensus sequence GCG(T/G)
GGGCG in promoters of a variety of target genes.13,14
In response to stimuli such as growth factors, cytokines, hormones, phorbol esters, irradiation, and
stresses the Egr-1 gene can be rapidly and transiently
induced. It appears that Egr-1 acts as a tumor suppressor in certain cells by initiating apoptosis upon
activation of PTEN15 and p53 expression.16 Moreover,
it was shown that treatment of C2C12 cells with TSA
induced Egr-1 expression.17
The regulation of PTEN has been extensively
studied. It was reported that PTEN expression was
regulated by p53,18 PPARg,19 Egr-1,15 NF-jB,20,21 and
TNF-b.22 However, whether histone acetylation modification is involved in PTEN transcriptional regulation has not been elucidated. Whereas the HDAC
inhibitor TSA can modulate cellular response to doxorubicin, the mechanism underlying this process is
unclear. Moreover, a recent study showed that treatment of C2C12 cells with TSA induced the expression
of Egr-1, which has been known to be the major
transcription factor of PTEN.17 It is therefore intriguing to speculate that TSA may up-regulate PTEN
expression by promoting histone acetylation at its
promoter and/or by inducing Egr-1 expression. The
aim of the present study was to clarify the functional
relations between the action of HDAC inhibitor TSA
and doxorubicin and to explore the mechanism by
which TSA increases the apoptosis induced by doxorubicin. We discovered that TSA was able to promote
the doxorubicin-induced apoptosis partly through

1677

up-regulating PTEN, during which Egr-1 played a
central role. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the
histone acetyltransferase p300 could cause the
hyperacetylation of histones at the PTEN promoter
to stimulate PTEN transcription through interacting
with Egr-1.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasmids
The human PTEN gene promoter luciferase reporter
construct was obtained by subcloning the 1978 basepair (bp) genomic DNA region upstream of the
human PTEN gene into the pGL-3basic-luc vector.15
The expression vectors containing the wildtype p300
(pCI-p300) and its HAT-deletion derivative (pCI-p300,
HATD1472–1522) were generously provided by Dr.
Joan Boyes (Institute of Cancer Research, UK).
Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) targeting PTEN
(50 -GAC TTG AAG GCG TAT ACA G-30 ),23 Egr-1
(50 -GCA AGT GGA TCT TGG TAT G-30 ),24 and p300
(50 -TGA CAC AGG CAG GCT TGA C-30 )25 genes were
synthesized according to published data. Oligonucleotides that represent these siRNAs were cloned
into the pSliencer2.0-U6 vector (Ambion, Austin, Tex)
between BamHI and HindIII restriction sites following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cell Culture
The 293T human embryonic kidney epithelial and
A549 type II alveolar adenocarcinoma cell lines were
purchased from the Institute of Cell Biology (Shanghai,
China). Cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum), 100 U/mL
penicillin, and 100 lg/mL streptomycin and kept in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.
Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay
For transient transfection, cells were seeded in 24well or 6-well plates and cultured for 18 hours before
being transfected using a standard calcium phosphate transfection method. Cells were then incubated at 378C for 4–6 hours before changing fresh
medium. After transfection, cells were cultured for 30
hours before harvested, then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in 30 lL lysis
buffer. Reporter gene expression was measured and
quantified using a dual Luciferase Reporter Assay
System (Promega, Madison, Wis). Relative luciferase
activity was analyzed by using a Turner Designs
TD20/20 Luminometer (Sunnyvale, Calif). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the activity of the
Renilla luciferase control.26 Extracts from at least 3

independent transfection experiments were assayed
in triplicate. The results are shown as means  SD.

Detection of Apoptosis
Cells were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured for
18 hours. After transient transfection or treatments
with TSA and doxorubicin, cells were cultured for 48
hours. Then cells were treated with 2% formaldehyde
for 10 minutes at 378C and washed with PBS. One
mL of 1% Triton X-100 and 4 lg/mL Hoechst33342
(Sigma, St. Louis, Mo) in PBS were slowly added and
the cells were incubated at room temperature for 15
minutes before replaced in 1 mL PBS. Cells with typical apoptotic nuclear morphology (nuclear shrinkage, condensation, and fragmentation) were identified
and counted within randomly selected fields. The apoptosis rates were calculated based on at least 300
cells from 3 independent experiments and are shown
as means  SD.
RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real-Time
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
Total RNA was extracted and reverse-transcribed to
cDNA using the RNA extraction and RT Systems
supplied by Promega. The resulting cDNA was
diluted 5-fold with RNase-free water. Quantitative
real-time PCR analysis was performed using an ABI
Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif). SYBR Green (TOYOBO,
Japan) was used as a double-stranded DNA-specific
fluorescent dye. b-Actin was used as a housekeeping
gene for standardizing PTEN and Egr-1 mRNA
expression. Amplification primers were 50 -GCG TGC
AGA TAA TGA C-30 and 50 -GAT TTG ACG GCT CCT-30
for PTEN gene; 50 -AGC CCT ACG AGC ACC TG-30 and
50 -CGG TGG GTT GGT CAT G-30 for Egr-1 gene; and
50 -GAC CCT CAG CTT TTA GGA ATC C-30 and 50 -TGC
CGT AGC AAC ACA GTG TCT-30 for p300 gene. Data
were analyzed by using the 2-DDCt method.27 All the
results represent means  SD of 3 independent
experiments.
Western Blot and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent
Assay (ELISA)
Cells were treated with TSA, incubated for 48 hours,
and then lysed in 50 lL luciferase lysis buffer. Cell
lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE in 12% gels and
then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and
subjected to Western blot analysis with rabbit polyclonal antibody against PTEN, and rabbit polyclonal
antibody against b-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, Calif ). Cell lysates were coated on a polystyrene plate for ELISA using polyclonal antibodies
against PTEN, b-actin, and p300 (Santa Cruz).

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
ChIP assays were carried out using a kit supplied by
Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) following
the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were plated at a
density of 1 3 105/mL in 24-well plate and cultured
for 48 hours. After transient transfection or TSA and
doxorubicin stimulation, cells were cross-linked with
2% formaldehyde for 10 minutes at 378C, then lysed
in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM
Tris, pH 8.1) with protease inhibitors. The sonicated
lysates were processed using a ChIP assay kit, essentially as described by the manufacturer (Upstate Biotechnology). Antibodies against Ac-H3 (cat. no. 06599) and Ac-H4 (cat. no. 06-866) were purchased
from Upstate Biotechnology and antibody against
p300 protein (sc-585) was purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology. Immunoprecipitated chromatin
was analyzed by quantitative PCR (ABI Prism 7000
Sequence Detection System Instrument) using SYBR
green dye with primers specific to sequences at the PTEN
promoter, i.e., 50 -AAA CGA GCC GAG TTA CCG-30
and 50 -GAC TGC ATT CGC TCT TTC CT-30 for RE I;
50 -CGG GCG GTG ATG TGG C-30 and 50 -GCC TCA
CAG CGG CTC AAC TCT-30 for RE II; and 50 -GTT
GGT CTC TCC CCT TCT A-30 and 50 -CGC AGC CGG
GTA ATG-30 for RE III.
Cellular Immunofluorescence
The 293T cells were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured for 18 hours, then transient transfected with
p300 expression plasmid or control empty vector.
The cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde in culture
medium for 10 minutes at 378C and permeabilized
with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 minutes at 48C.
The PTEN protein was detected with antibody against
PTEN and visualized with an FITC-conjugated antirabbit IgG secondary antibody (Zhongshan, China).
Photographs were taken with a Nikon microscope
with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter.
Statistical Analysis
A Student test was used to calculate the statistical
significance of the experimental results. The significance level was set as *P < .05 and **P < .01.

RESULTS
PTEN Participated in TSA/Doxorubicin-Induced Apoptosis
It was reported that the doxorubicin-induced apoptosis can be enhanced by TSA,11,12 and this has been
confirmed in our experimental system. As shown
in Figure 1A, no significant apoptosis was observed
in control cells. Treatments of TSA and doxorubicin
alone induced apoptosis rates of approximately 8%

PTEN played important roles in the TSA/doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. 293T cells were treated with 250 nM Trichostatin A (TSA) or 200 nM doxorubicin (DOXO) for 48 hours and the apoptosis was examined microscopically after Hoechst33342 staining.

and 20%, respectively. Meanwhile, a combination of
both TSA and doxorubicin resulted in an apoptosis
rate of as high as 76.9% (Fig. 1A). In the next experiments we endeavored to explore some of the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.
We first focused on the tumor suppressor gene
phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) because it was reported that
overexpression of PTEN promoted the therapeutic
effect of doxorubicin.5 To assess whether PTEN plays
a role in the TSA-induced apoptosis we constructed
an siRNA plasmid (PTENsiRNA) targeting the PTEN
gene and transiently transfected it into 293T cells.
We identified that knockdown of PTEN by siRNA partially inhibited the apoptosis induced by TSA and
doxorubicin (Fig. 1B). We also found that PTEN

expression was up-regulated by TSA and doxorubicin,
whereas siRNA targeting PTEN could reduce PTEN
expression (Fig. 1C). These findings implied that the
effect of TSA in enhancing the doxorubicin-induced
apoptosis was associated, at least in part, with the
expression of PTEN.

PTEN Participated in TSA/Doxorubicin-Induced
Apoptosis Through Up-regulation of Egr-1
We then intended to investigate whether any genes
upstream of PTEN are involved in this process. The
first gene we came across was the immediate early
growth response-1 (Egr-1) gene because it can induce
apoptosis by stimulating p53 and PTEN expression,
and there has been evidence that TSA induces Egr-1
expression.17

3% and 14%, respectively. Egr-1siRNA reduced the

whether Egr-1 is the target of TSA and doxorubicin
action, we transfected 293T cells with Egr-1siRNA
and treated the cells with TSA and doxorubicin. As
shown in Figure 2B, the Egr-1 mRNA level was elevated by 3.5-fold and 1.8-fold when the cells were
treated with TSA and doxorubicin, respectively,
whereas a nearly 8-fold increase was seen when the
cells were treated simultaneously with both TSA and
doxorubicin. Meanwhile, transfection of the Egr1siRNA expression vector markedly down-regulated
Egr-1 expression (Fig. 2B) and PTEN expression (Fig.
2C), even when treated with TSA and doxorubicin.
We presume that the expression of PTEN was
decreased because the transcription factor Egr-1 was
knocked down by Egr-1siRNA. These results suggested that both PTEN and Egr-1 participated in the
TSA/doxorubicin-induced apoptosis.

TSA Induced Histone Hyperacetylation and
Up-regulated PTEN Expression
We have shown above that TSA increased the doxorubicin-induced apoptosis through regulation of
PTEN and Egr-1 expression. As an HDAC inhibitor,
TSA is capable of stimulating transcription of
many genes by altering histone acetylation status
at the gene’s promoters. We then asked whether
TSA can directly stimulate PTEN transcription, or
indirectly via Egr-1 regulation. To assess this, we
first treated 293T cells with TSA and found that it
increased PTEN promoter activity (Fig. 3A, left).
This implied that histone acetylation might be
involved in PTEN regulation. Also, we treated 293T
cells and another tumor cell, A549, with TSA, and
as shown in Figure 3A (middle, right), the PTEN
mRNA level was increased by 8-fold in 293T cells
and by 2-fold in A549 cells, respectively, further
suggesting that TSA could activate PTEN transcription. Furthermore, our Western blot and ELISA
(Fig. 3B) data revealed that TSA could increase
PTEN protein expression.
We then cotransfected 293T cells with PTEN promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid with the 6 human
HDACs (HDAC1-6), and as can be seen in Figure 3C,
among the 6 HDACs tested, 5 (HDAC1, 3, 4, 5, and 6)
were able to inhibit the PTEN promoter activity, to
variable extents, providing further hints that TSA
may act on PTEN through inhibiting these HDACs.
However, the straight evidence for the action of TSA
on the PTEN gene regulation came from our chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments
using antibodies against Ac-H3 and Ac-H4. For a
quantitative estimation of the precipitated DNA, coordinates of primers relative to the translation start

site were designed as follows: RE I (1703/1477,
distant domain); RE II (920/784, major Egr-1
binding domain), and RE III (413/156, proximal
Egr-1 binding domain) (Fig. 3D, upper). The results
showed that TSA treatment of 293T cells increased
the acetylation level of histone H3 at the Egr-1 binding domains of the PTEN promoter, with the highest
increase up to 55-fold at the RE III region (Fig. 3D,
lower left), whereas the histone H4 acetylation level
was also significantly increased at the major Egr-1
binding domain (RE II), but it was decreased at RE
III (Fig. 3D, lower right). These results clearly indicated that TSA induced PTEN transcription by inhibiting HDAC activities that facilitated histone
hyperacetylation.

Histone Acetyltransferase p300 Promoted
PTEN Expression
Because the status of histone acetylation is balanced
by a coordinated function of both histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and HDACs, we were then curious to know if any HATs participate in this process.
Transcriptional coactivator p300 was the first HAT we
were interested in because it can regulate the activities of many transcription factors and it has a physical interaction with Egr-1.28 To determine whether
p300 plays a role in PTEN regulation, we transiently
transfected 293T cell with p300 expression plasmid
and the ectopic expression of p300 was confirmed by
both quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 4B, left) and
ELISA (Fig. 4B, right). The transfection results
demonstrated that both PTEN promoter activity (Fig.
4A, left) and endogenous mRNA level (Fig. 4A, right)
were increased by the overexpression of p300 in a
dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, the protein
level of PTEN was also enhanced accordingly after
p300 transfection (Fig. 4C). To further verify the
function of p300, we constructed an siRNA targeting
p300 gene (p300siRNA), transiently transfected 293T
cells with p300 and p300siRNA plasmid, followed by
ChIP assays with antibodies against Ac-H3, Ac-H4,
and p300. As shown in Figure 5A, acetylation levels
of histone H4 at all the PTEN promoter domains
were elevated, especially at the RE III region, when
transfected with p300 plasmid (Fig. 5A, upper left).
Conversely, the histone acetylation levels at these
sites were reduced when transfected with p300siRNA
(Fig. 5A, upper left). Moreover, our ChIP assays also
showed that transfection of p300 plasmid increased
the presence of p300 protein at the PTEN promoter,
especially at the RE II and RE III regions (Fig. 5A,
lower), suggesting that p300 was associated with the
PTEN promoter and increased histone H4 acetyla-

tion, but it had little effect on histone H3 (data not
shown).
To ascertain whether p300 synergistically activates PTEN promoter with Egr-1, we cotransfected
293T cells with p300 and Egr-1 plasmids and the
results showed that p300 or Egr-1 alone increased
PTEN promoter activity by nearly 3-fold (Fig. 5B),
whereas a simultaneous transfection of both p300
and Egr-1 caused a sharp increase in activation of
the promoter by over 17-fold (Fig. 5B). Next, we
cotransfected p300siRNA, wildtype p300, and HATdeletion p300 (p300 delat HAT) plasmids, and found
that knockdown of p300 by siRNA inhibited PTEN
promoter activity and prevented p300’s synergistic
activity with Egr-1 (Fig. 5C). To our surprise, the
p300 delat HAT had roughly the same effect on PTEN
promoter in contrast to the wildtype p300 (Fig. 5D),
implying that the HAT domain of p300 was not essential for PTEN activation, though it was necessary for
p300 and Egr-1 interaction (Fig. 5D). Together, these
findings suggested that p300 participated in Egr-1directed PTEN transcriptional activation.

TSA Enhanced the Synergistic Role of p300
and Egr-1 in Activating PTEN
In the following experiments we tested the effects of
the HDAC inhibitor on the action of p300 and Egr-1
in stimulating the PTEN gene. As shown in Figure
6A, p300 and Egr-1 were able to activate the PTEN
promoter synergistically, whereas treatment with the
HDAC inhibitor TSA increased this transcriptional
activity by around 1000-fold (Fig. 6A, the top bar).
Meanwhile, siRNAs targeting p300 and Egr-1 inhibited interaction of p300 with Egr-1, resulting in a
reduction of PTEN expression, with or without TSA
treatment (Fig. 6B). It is apparent that knockdown of
Egr-1 by siRNA had a more intense effect than
knockdown of p300 (Fig. 6B). Because there have
been reports that Egr-1 can regulate p300 expression,29 and Egr-1 can interact with p300,28 we deduce
that in our experimental system Egr-1 may also upregulate p300, interact with p300, and facilitate the
binding of p300 to the PTEN promoter to activate its
transcription.
Overall, data arising from this study support a
model that depicts the function of TSA in potentiating doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Briefly, TSA promotes apoptosis through up-regulation of PTEN in 2
ways. First, as an HDAC inhibitor TSA is able to
enhance the histone acetylation of the PTEN promoter that activates PTEN transcription (Fig. 3). In
addition, TSA may stimulate Egr-1 expression, which
in turn up-regulates PTEN (Fig. 2B). Conversely, the
histone acetyltransferase p300 participates in this

1685

regulatory process either by acetylating histone H4 at
the PTEN promoter to stimulate its transcription
(Fig. 5A, upper left) or by functioning synergistically
with Egr-1 to activate PTEN (Fig. 5B).

DISCUSSION
Previous studies revealed that TSA could promote apoptosis induced by doxorubicin.11,12 Also, it has been
well established that TSA induces cell differentiation,
cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis in numerous transformed cell lines and cancer cells.30 As a histone
deacetylase inhibitor, TSA is thought to exert its anticancer effects by causing the accumulation of acetylated histones, which consequently results in the
alteration of transcription of target genes, such as
transcription factors NF-jB, GATA1, E2F-1, and MyoD,
or components of the transcriptional machinery.31–33
Furthermore, it was proven that key regulators of apoptotic signaling cascades, such as Rb and p53, were
altered by HDAC inhibitors.34
The aim of this study was to explore whether the
tumor suppressor gene PTEN participated in the
TSA/doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. As shown in
Figure 1B, siRNA targeting the PTEN gene inhibited
TSA/doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, and the mRNA
level of PTEN was up-regulated by TSA and doxorubicin treatments (Fig. 1C). Moreover, we found that
TSA was able to activate PTEN gene expression at
the promoter activity, mRNA, and protein levels (Fig.
3). To gain further insight into this phenomenon, we
designed a series of ChIP primer pairs targeting the
Egr-1 binding domains (RE II and RE III) and an irrelevant domain (RE I) at the PTEN promoter for ChIP
experiments to detect the histone acetylation levels
at these domains, considering that Egr-1 is the main
transcription factor of PTEN. As can be seen in Figure 3D, there was little change in the acetylation
levels of both histone H3 and histone H4 at the RE I
domain when the cells were treated with TSA, suggesting that it was not a transcriptional active domain. It has been reported that there are 3 Egr-1
binding sites at the PTEN promoter region spanning
947 to 914 relative to the translation start site,15
and the RE II domain is located in this region. Data
from our ChIP assays showed that both histone H3
and histone H4 were hyperacetylated at the RE II
domain (Fig. 3D). Previous study has established that
the PTEN promoter from 551 to 220 is a transcriptional active domain, and there are 2 Egr-1
binding sites within this domain.35 Thus, these
results are suggestive of the TSA function in inducing
histone hyperacetylation and facilitating Egr-1 binding to PTEN promoter to stimulate its expression.

FIGURE 6. The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) enhanced the synergistic effect of p300 and Egr-1 in activating PTEN transcription.
(a) 293T cells were transiently transfected with p300 and Egr-1 expression vectors, treated with TSA for 30 hours, and the luciferase reporter activity was
determined (*P < .05, **P < .01). (b) 293T cells were cotransfected with p300, Egr-1, p300siRNA, and Egr-1siRNA vectors, and the PTEN expression was
examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (*P < .05, **P < .01).

TSA Up-regulated PTEN to Promote Apoptosis/Pan et al.

Apparently, PTEN may be 1 of the target genes functioning in the TSA/doxorubicin-induced apoptosis.
Egr-1 is the major transcription factor of PTEN: it
functions as a convergence point for many signaling
cascades and regulates the expression of many genes.
Here we show that Egr-1 is an intermediate regulator
involved in the TSA-induced PTEN activation. We
also show that TSA treatment could up-regulate Egr1 expression (Fig. 2B) and that transient transfection
of Egr-1 expression plasmid promoted the PTEN
transcription (Fig. 5B). In addition, we found that
treatment of cells with TSA significantly increased
the transcriptional activity of Egr-1 (Fig. 6B). These
findings implied that TSA activated PTEN expression
by up-regulating Egr-1 expression or promoting histone hyperacetylation of the PTEN promoter, thus
facilitating Egr-1 binding to the promoter.
A next reasonable assumption was that there
might be a histone acetylase involved in the PTEN
transcription regulation, considering that histone
acetylation is a coordinated reversible modification
process. Our data demonstrated that the histone
acetylase p300 played an important role in PTEN
regulation, as it could activate the PTEN promoter
and up-regulate PTEN expression at both the mRNA
and protein levels (Fig. 4). As a transcriptional coactivator and an HAT, p300 participates in gene transcriptional regulation through multiple mechanisms.
It may act as a protein bridge connecting different
sequence-specific transcription factors to the transcription apparatus.36,37 p300 may also provide a
protein scaffold for the assembly of a multicomponent transcriptional regulatory complex.37 However,
the key property of p300 is its HAT activity, being
able to catalyze histone acetylation. We have presented ChIP evidence that p300 could be associated
with the PTEN promoter to induce the hyperacetylation of histone H4 (Fig. 5A), although it had little
effect on histone H3. As shown in Figure 5D, the
HAT-deleted mutant of p300 did not significantly
affect its function in promoting the expression of
PTEN, but its synergistic function with Egr-1 was
markedly reduced (Fig. 5D). It appears that the HAT
activity of p300 was not indispensable nor the only
mechanism for PTEN regulation. Our results show
that knockdown of endogenous expression of p300
by specific siRNA reduced PTEN expression and
inhibited Egr-1 transcription (Fig. 5C). Because there
has been evidence that p300 can interact with Egr1,28 we deduce that p300 may participate in PTEN
transcriptional regulation mainly through its protein
bridge or scaffold mechanism. This assumption is
supported by the result that the HAT-deletion p300
also stimulated PTEN expression (Fig. 5D).

1687

Altogether, the experimental data presented in
this report suggest a molecular mechanism that TSA
potentiates the doxorubicin-induced apoptosis by
up-regulating PTEN expression, and the histone acetyltransferase p300 and the transcription factor Egr-1
participate in this process. This molecular model will
provide useful information for the development of a
combinatorial therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment involving HDAC inhibitors (such as TSA) and
doxorubicin.
