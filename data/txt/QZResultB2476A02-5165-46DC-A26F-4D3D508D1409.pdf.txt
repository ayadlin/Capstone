Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities
in Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Older
Women With Lymph Node-positive,
Operable Breast Cancer
Alessia Bhargava1 and Xianglin L. Du, MD, PhD2

BACKGROUND: Consistent with findings from clinical trials, a recent population-based study indicated that
adjuvant chemotherapy for lymph node-positive, operable breast cancer is effective at improving survival
in older women, specifically those ages 65 years to 69 years; however, to the authors’ knowledge, no conclusion has been reached about the relative benefit of chemotherapy for women aged 70 years, probably
because of small number of patients. However, little is known about racial and socioeconomic disparities in
adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer among older women. METHODS: This study included 14,177 white
women and 1277 black women aged 65 years who were diagnosed with operable breast cancer (stage IIIIIA) and positive lymph nodes between 1991 and 2002. These women were identified from the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results and Medicare-linked database. Multivariate logistic regression was used to
compute the odds ratios of receiving chemotherapy among black women compared with white women,
and the causal step approach was used to test whether census tract-level poverty mediated racial disparities. RESULTS: Interaction terms analyses indicated that regressions should be stratified by age group. In
the group ages 65 years to 69 years, the adjusted odds ratio of receiving chemotherapy were lower for
black women than for white women (odds ratio, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.57-0.97). Poverty mediated the association between chemotherapy and race in this age group. No racial or socioeconomic disparities were observed among women aged 70 years. CONCLUSIONS: This study documented racial
disparities in adjuvant chemotherapy that were mediated by poverty in women ages 65 years to 69 years,
an age group for which there is clear evidence for the efficacy of chemotherapy, but no disparities were
observed among women aged 70 years. The authors concluded that it is important to work toward reducC 2009 American Cancer

A disproportionate number of breast cancer deaths occur
1,2

in racial and ethnic minorities. In particular, AfricanAmerican women have greater breast cancer recurrence
rates and higher mortality rates than white women.3-5 The
causes for these disparities include a more advanced stage
of disease at diagnosis in African-American women, racial
differences in tumor characteristics and comorbid conditions,4 and racial differences in treatment.1-2,5-8 Several
studies have indicated that adjusting for tumor characteristics and treatment eliminated or greatly attenuated racial
differences in survival2,9,10; however, others observed a
persistent disadvantage in survival for African-American
women.11 In addition, several studies have investigated
racial differences in breast cancer treatment after controlling for disease severity, prognostic factors, and comorbidities.3,5-8 The findings about racial differences in adjuvant
therapy in women with early breast cancer are inconsistent, depending on the type of adjuvant therapy and the
stage at diagnosis.12-15 Several studies have indicated that,
even when African-American women received chemotherapy, they received suboptimal treatment.16-19
Older women are affected disproportionately by
breast cancer. Greater than 50% of breast cancer deaths
occur among women aged 65 years, and the median age
at diagnosis is 61 years.20 However, older women with
breast cancer are more likely to be under-treated. Increasing age is associated with not receiving effective cancer
therapies, even after controlling for comorbidity and
prognostic factors.13,21-23 Recent research using a population-based, observational cohort24 has demonstrated that
adjuvant chemotherapy for lymph node-positive, operable
breast cancer is effective at improving survival in older
women, specifically those ages 65 years to 69 years,
although no conclusion has been reached about the relative benefit of chemotherapy for women aged 70 years,
probably because of the small number of patients. These
results are consistent with findings from clinical trials.25
However, very little is known about racial disparities in
adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer treatment
among older women. Several studies have reported breast
cancer chemotherapy in older women,6,13,21 but few have
investigated racial disparities.12,22,26 Mandelblatt and colleagues12,26 observed that, among Medicare beneficiaries
aged 67 years with local breast carcinoma, African
Americans were less likely to receive radiotherapy after
breast-conservation surgery. In an article that focused on
3000

the relation between chemotherapy and age among Medicare breast cancer patients for all stages, Du and Goodwin22 noticed no racial differences in the use of
chemotherapy. A recent article also indicated that there
were no racial differences in the receipt of chemotherapy
among breast cancer patients ages 66 years to 85 years.27
Given the recent findings in support of the effectiveness of chemotherapy among older women ages 65 years
to 69 years with early (stage II and IIIA) breast cancer24
and the persistent disadvantage in breast cancer-specific
mortality among older African-American women with
early stage breast cancer compared with white women,2 it
is important to investigate further the racial disparities in
adjuvant chemotherapy among older women with early
stage breast cancer. In the current study, we investigated
racial disparities in the receipt adjuvant chemotherapy by
patients with lymph node-positive, operable breast cancer
in a much larger and recently updated, population-based
cohort of women aged 65 years from 1991 through
2002 who had up to 16 years of follow-up. We studied
this population because adjuvant chemotherapy is
strongly recommended based on guidelines for patients
with lymph node-positive, operable breast cancer ages 65
years to 69 years.28,29 The guidelines for chemotherapy in
women aged >70 years are less clear.28,29 Furthermore,
we investigated whether racial disparities were mediated
by socioeconomic status (SES). We used the National
Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results (SEER) cancer registry data linked to Medicare
data in the 16 areas that account for >25% of the total
US population. Because of the large sample size, we were
able to investigate racial differences in the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy among 4 subgroups of older women
ages 65 years to 69 years, 70 years to 74 years, 75 years to
79 years, and 80 years.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Sources
For the current study we used the SEER-Medicare linked
database, which is supported by the National Cancer
Institute and covers the 16 SEER areas. Because of the
small number of patients, we combined rural Georgia
with Atlanta and combined 4 registries in California (San
Francisco, Los Angeles, San Jose, and the rest of

California), making the 16 areas into 12 geographic areas.
The Medicare program provides payment for >97% of
medical care for individuals aged 65 years.
Study Population and Sample Size Needed
The study population consisted of 15,598 African-American and white women aged 65 years who were diagnosed with operable breast cancer (stage II or IIIA) and
who also had positive lymph nodes during the period
from 1991 to 2002. These women were identified from
the 12 SEER areas. Women in the study population had
full coverage with both Medicare Parts A and B and were
not enrolled with Health Maintenance Organizations during the year of diagnosis. The study population did not
include women who had other primary cancers. Women
who had missing SES variables were excluded; thus,
15,454 women (14,177 white women and 1277 AfricanAmerican women) were included in the final analyses. On
the basis of a sample-size equation for comparing 2 proportions,30 395 women would be needed in each racial
group to have 80% power to detect a prevalence difference
of 6% in receiving chemotherapy with a P value < .05.
Study Variables
Chemotherapy

Confirmation that chemotherapy was received
within 6 months of breast cancer diagnosis was obtained
from Medicare claims. The identification of chemotherapy through Medicare claims has been described previously described and reportedly is reliable.31
Comorbidity Index

Comorbidity was ascertained from Medicare claims
by identifying diagnoses made or procedures undergone 1
year before and 1 month after the diagnosis of breast cancer, including heart disease, diabetes, and dementia but
excluding any malignant tumor. Comorbid diseases
within 1 month of diagnosis were included because they
are likely to influence the choice of chemotherapy (as discussed in previous studies2,5).
Socioeconomic Status

SES was measured by poverty rate at the census tract
level from the 1990 Census and the 2000 Census available
Cancer

in the SEER-Medicare linked data. Data from the 1990
Census were linked to women who were diagnosed during
1991 through 1999, and data from the 2000 Census were
linked to women who were diagnosed in 2000 or later.
The census tract-level poverty rates, defined as the percentage of individuals living below the federal poverty
line, were categorized into quartiles.
Other Characteristics

Patient and tumor characteristics, such as age, race,
marital status, tumor stage, tumor size, tumor grade, hormone receptor status, surgery and radiation, geographic
area (12 SEER areas), and year of diagnosis, were available
from the SEER data. Age was categorized into 4 subgroups (ages 65-69 years, 70-74 years, 75-79 years, and
80 years).
Analyses
Differences in the distribution of baseline characteristics
between African-American women and white women
were tested using the chi-square statistic. Differences in
the receipt of chemotherapy by race stratified by age subgroup also were tested using the chi-square statistic. The
odds ratios (OR) of receiving chemotherapy for AfricanAmerican women compared with white women were generated from multivariate logistic regression analyses.
Three models with increasing numbers of covariates were
estimated. The first model included only race and age.
The second model was adjusted further for tumor biologic
factors and treatment (tumor stage, tumor size, tumor
grade, hormone receptor status, surgery, and radiation)
and other patient characteristics (marital status, comorbidity index, geographic area, and year of diagnosis). The
third model investigated whether poverty mediated
the relation between race and chemotherapy by adding
the poverty variable to all covariates from the second
model. Mediation was tested using the causal step
approach.32,33 The test of whether poverty mediated the
relation of race to chemotherapy included 3 steps: 1) a
regression of chemotherapy adjusted for race, 2) a regression of chemotherapy adjusted for race and poverty, and
3) a regression of race adjusted for poverty. The analysis
indicated that poverty mediated the association of race on
chemotherapy if, in the first regression, race was statistically significant; if, in the second regression, race was not

regression, poverty was significant.
We tested whether the associations between chemotherapy and race varied by age group by examining interactions between race and age. The statistical significance
of interaction terms that were added to the logistic regression of chemotherapy adjusted for race and age groups
indicated that separate regressions by age group were
appropriate. To investigate racial disparities in chemotherapy within the different age groups (ages 65-69 years,
70-74 years, 75-79 years, and 80 years), all multivariate
logistic regression analyses were repeated for stratifications
by age group. Parameter estimates were obtained using

RESULTS
Table 1 compares the use of chemotherapy, tumor biologic factors, and other patient characteristics between
white women and black women. When tumor, treatment,
and patient characteristics were not controlled for, white
women and black women had similar rates of chemotherapy. Racial differences were significant for all other characteristics except year of diagnosis. Compared with white
women, black women were more likely to be younger, less
likely to be married, and more likely to live in census tracts
with higher poverty rates. They were more likely have
stage IIIA (vs stage II) disease; they had larger tumors,
more positive lymph nodes, and less favorable tumor

grade; they were less likely to have positive hormone receptor status and to undergo breast-conserving surgery
with radiation; and they had higher comorbidity scores.
To investigate racial differences in the receipt of
chemotherapy by age, Table 2 compares chemotherapy in
white women and black women within age groups. Black
women were less likely to receive chemotherapy in the
group ages 65 years to 69 years, but there were no racial
differences in the older age groups. To further investigate
the relation between race and age in chemotherapy, we
estimated a logistic regression of chemotherapy based on
race and age group. The ORs for race (0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.97; P ¼ .02) were statistically
significant. Next, we investigated interactions between
race and age by adding interaction terms to the regression.
Interaction terms were significant (P ¼ .03; chi-square
test of joint significance), indicating that the associations
between chemotherapy and race varied by age group.
Therefore, we estimated logistic regressions stratified by
age group for chemotherapy adjusted for race while controlling for tumor, treatment, and patient characteristics
(Table 3).
3004

Two models are presented in Table 3. Model-1
presents the OR of receiving chemotherapy for black
women compared with white women adjusted for patient
and tumor characteristics except for SES. Model 2
presents the OR of receiving chemotherapy for black
women compared with white women by adding SES to
the model in addition to other factors from Model 1.
Model 2 also includes the effects of other factors on the
receipt of chemotherapy. After adjusting for patient and
tumor characteristics, black women were significantly less
likely than white women to receive chemotherapy in the
group ages 65 years to 69 years (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.520.90; P ¼ .01), and black women were marginally less
likely to receive chemotherapy in the group ages 70 years
to 74 years (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.56-1.00; P ¼ .05).
There were no racial differences in chemotherapy the
group ages 75 years to 79 years or in the group aged 80
years.
However, after also adjusting for SES (poverty variable) in the model, racial disparity in the receipt of chemotherapy no longer was significant in patients ages 65
years to 69 years, indicating that poverty may explain the
racial differences in chemotherapy for this age group and
is a candidate mediator between chemotherapy and race.
By using the causal step approach, we observed that poverty indeed mediated the correlation of race with chemotherapy, because: 1) race was significant in the regression
of chemotherapy adjusted for race (Model 1 in Table 3);
2) race was not significant and poverty was significant in
the regression of chemotherapy adjusted for both race and
poverty (Model 2 in Table 3); and 3) poverty was significant in the regression of race adjusted for poverty (P <
.05; chi-square test of significance for poverty quartiles).
In Table 3, among patients ages 70 years to 74 years, race
no longer was marginally significant after adding poverty
to the model, and poverty was not significant. In the
groups ages 75 years to79 years and aged 80 years, neither race nor poverty was significant. In addition, racial
disparity in the receipt of chemotherapy did not differ significantly in the early period (1991-1997) or in the later
period (1998-2002). In both periods, the ORs by race
were not significant in patients ages 65 years to 69 years
(OR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.54-1.32] vs 0.71 [95% CI, 0.471.06]) and patients aged 70 years (OR, 0.84 [95% CI,
0.60-1.17] vs 0.99 [95% CI, 0.78-1.24]), although the
magnitude differed slightly with overlapping confidence

intervals. However, this stratified analysis by period had
smaller numbers of patients, which made the estimates
relatively unstable and made the confidence intervals
wider. Although the sample size for comparison between
blacks and whites on the receipt of chemotherapy was sufficient overall (395 women for each group of blacks and
whites were required), subgroups analyses had smaller
numbers and less power to detect differences. Furthermore, we repeated all analyses with the population of
15,598 women, which included women who had missing
SES variables, and the magnitude and direction of the
findings were similar.
Model 2 in Table 3 also presents the effect of other
factors on the receipt of chemotherapy by age group. The
higher likelihood of receiving chemotherapy generally was
associated with married women, higher tumor stage, more
positive lymph nodes, poor tumor grade, negative hormone receptor status, and lower comorbidity scores
among women ages 65 years to 69 years. In the older age
groups, the general patterns were similar; however, the
results were less stable, because the numbers of patients
who received chemotherapy among older women (particularly those aged >80 years) were small.

DISCUSSION
In women who had lymph node-positive, operable breast
cancer, we observed racial differences in adjuvant chemotherapy in women ages 65 years to 69 years, marginal differences in women aged 70 years to 74 and no differences
in women aged over 74. Given the strong evidence about
the effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy and current
treatment guidelines recommending adjuvant chemotherapy in this population of women aged 65 years to 69, our
findings of racial differences in this age group are of concern. It is interesting that racial disparities narrowed with
age and that no racial differences were found in women
aged 75 and over for which the evidence of efficacy and
the treatment guidelines are less clear.25,29
Some previous studies failed to identify racial differences in the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy among
older women.12,22,27 However, none of those studies specifically investigated adjuvant chemotherapy in the group
ages 65 years to 69 years. Analyzing the receipt of adjuvant
chemotherapy among all women aged 65 years can be
misleading, because evidence of efficacy and treatment
3006

guidelines varies by age. Our results indicate that there are
interactions between race and age in the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy. It is well known that, as women age,
they are less likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy.13,2123
In fact, evidence of efficacy and treatment guidelines
are less clear for women aged 70 years, because there is a
lack of women in that age group who participate in clinical trials.25,29 However, the data from the current study
indicate that, although the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy decreased with age in this large nationwide, population-based cohort of women with lymph node-positive,
operable breast cancer, a substantial portion of older
women in the population did receive chemotherapy (47%
of women ages 70-74 years, 30% of women ages 75-79
years, and 10% of women aged 80 years). Therefore,
there is a need to improve enrollment of breast cancer
patients aged 70 years in clinical trials investigating the
effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy to develop clearer
guidelines for older women.
The relation between race and treatment may not be
explored fully without understanding the role of SES.11,35
Because of the strong correlation between minority status
and SES, race often is a surrogate measure for SES in
health studies. This leads some investigators to conclude
inappropriately that there are racial differences in outcomes.2 We observed that racial differences in the receipt
of adjuvant chemotherapy in the group ages 65 years to
69 years were mediated by census tract poverty rates.
These results demonstrate that socioeconomic factors like
poverty that are associated with race may be responsible
for the disparities between African-American women and
white women in the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy for
this age group. Even in our population of Medicareinsured women, poverty can influence treatment decisions
through access and cost of care because of the difficulty
poorer women may have in paying out-of-pocket costs
and copayments. Quality of care also may be worse in
poorer neighborhoods. Poverty has been associated with
limited access to care, limited treatment options, and difficulty with treatment compliance.36 Women living in
poorer neighborhoods also may be more likely to have
poorer health, more comorbid conditions, worse employment, and different health beliefs. In addition, married
women are more likely to receive chemotherapy, possibly
because of higher motivation for chemotherapy and more
family support, which includes transportation for visiting

outpatient clinics to receive chemotherapy every few
weeks for several months. All of these factors may have an
impact on the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy.15
Limitations of the current study include the availability of SES indicators only at the census tract level.
Although living in disadvantaged neighborhood is an independent predictor of healthcare behavior, the lack of
individual-level SES measures may introduce residual
confounding. Lack of information on provider characteristics, patient and physician treatment preferences,
and hospitals or sites of care is another limitation. In
addition, there was no information on whether the quality of claims for chemotherapy in Medicare data varies
by blacks and whites, which may have affected racial differences in the receipt of chemotherapy. However, this
was not supported by our previous study, which demonstrated that the quality of Medicare claims for radiation
therapy did not vary significantly between blacks and
whites.37 Furthermore, although sample size for comparing 2 proportions of chemotherapy between blacks
and whites were sufficient at 80% power with P < .05
overall or even in stratified analysis by ages 65 years to
69 years and 70 years, the sample size became smaller
in further stratifications by ages 70 years to 74 years, 75
years to 79 years, and 80 years. Therefore, the estimates from these subgroups may be interpreted with
caution.
In conclusion, the current study documents racial
disparities in the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy that
were mediated by census tract-level poverty in women
ages 65 years to 69 years with lymph node-positive, operable breast cancer, a group for which there is clear evidence
for the efficacy of chemotherapy. There were no racial or
socioeconomic disparities in receiving chemotherapy
among women aged 70 years, for whom there is no clear
evidence of the efficacy of chemotherapy. Disparities in
treatment may explain some of the racial disparities in
breast cancer outcomes.2 It is important to work toward
reducing these treatment disparities, especially in light of
evidence that there is no difference in response to adjuvant
chemotherapy between African-American women and
white women.38,39
