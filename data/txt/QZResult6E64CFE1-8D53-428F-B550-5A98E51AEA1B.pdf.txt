Abstract
The actin cytoskeleton is a potentially vulnerable property of cancer cells, yet chemotherapeutic targeting
attempts have been hampered by unacceptable toxicity. In this study, we have shown that it is possible to disrupt
speciﬁc actin ﬁlament populations by targeting isoforms of tropomyosin, a core component of actin ﬁlaments,
that are selectively upregulated in cancers. A novel class of anti-tropomyosin compounds has been developed
that preferentially disrupts the actin cytoskeleton of tumor cells, impairing both tumor cell motility and viability.
Our lead compound, TR100, is effective in vitro and in vivo in reducing tumor cell growth in neuroblastoma and
melanoma models. Importantly, TR100 shows no adverse impact on cardiac structure and function, which is the
major side effect of current anti-actin drugs. This proof-of-principle study shows that it is possible to target
speciﬁc actin ﬁlament populations fundamental to tumor cell viability based on their tropomyosin isoform
composition. This improvement in speciﬁcity provides a pathway to the development of a novel class of anti-actin
compounds for the potential treatment of a wide variety of cancers. Cancer Res; 73(16); 5169–82. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
The idea of targeting the actin cytoskeleton is not new, given
its role in cellular transformation and biologic processes such
as cell division and cell migration (1–4). It is therefore surprising that there are still no anti-actin compounds used in
current chemotherapy (5). The primary reason for this is the
inability of existing anti-actin agents to discriminate between

the actin cytoskeleton of tumor cells and the actin ﬁlaments of
the muscle sarcomere. Although actin-targeting drugs such as
cytochalasin D and jasplakinolide have shown great promise as
antiproliferative agents in vitro (6, 7), neither has made it
through to preclinical trials due to universal toxicity (8). This
has led to the development of agents that target actin regulatory proteins, which are more speciﬁcally expressed in the
specialized actin cytoskeleton of tumor cells (5).
The mammalian tropomyosins are a family of more than 40
coiled–coil proteins that are an integral component of actin
ﬁlaments (9). There is mounting evidence from systems as
diverse as yeast and mammals that individual tropomyosin
dimers form largely homopolymers along the length of actin
ﬁlaments and regulate the functional capacity of the ﬁlament
in an isoform-speciﬁc manner (10–15). This speciﬁcity of
tropomyosin isoform composition provides an opportunity to
target distinct actin ﬁlament populations both within a given
cell type and between cell types (9, 16).
We have developed a novel class of anti-tropomyosin (antiTm) compounds, which preferentially target cytoskeletal (nonmuscle) tropomyosin-containing ﬁlaments in cancer cells. The
lead compound, TR100, is effective against a panel of neural
crest-derived tumor cell lines in both two-dimensional (2D)
and three-dimensional (3D) cultures with minimal impact on
the contractile properties of isolated rat adult cardiomyocytes
(ACM). Using melanoma and neuroblastoma mouse xenograft
models, we have also shown that TR100 is effective in reducing
tumor cell growth in vivo without compromising cardiac
function. Showing that it is possible to selectively target actin
ﬁlaments required for tumor cell survival leads the way to

anti-actin compounds. Therefore, therapeutics based on this
novel class of anti-tropomyosin compounds would have the

24 hours later. Random regions of interest were imaged every 5
minutes for 24 hours following drug treatment using the Nikon
Biostation microscope equipped with a cell incubator regulating temperature and CO2 levels.

Materials and Methods

Western blotting
Tropomyosin expression proﬁles were analyzed via SDSPAGE as described previously (17). High-molecular weight
(HMW) tropomyosins, Tm2, Tm3, Tm6, and Tm1, were assessed
using a/9d (17) or 311 (Sigma) and low-molecular weight
Tm5NM1/2 and Tm4 using the g/9d and d/9d antibodies,
respectively (17). Sarcomeric tropomyosins were assessed using
the CH1 antibody (Sigma), which recognizes exon 1a of all
muscle tropomyosins. Cleaved PARP antibody was purchased
from AbCam, a-tubulin and C4 actin antibodies were purchased
from Sigma. Western blot analyses were scanned on a Biorad Gel
doc imaging system and quantiﬁed using ImageJ software.

Cells and cell culture
Mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF) were isolated and cultured as previously described (17). Melanocytes were isolated
from 3 independent donors and cultured as previously
described (18). SKN-AS, SKN-SH, SKN-Be2C, IMR-32, SH-EP,
B16/F10, and SK-MEL-28 cell lines were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) and 10% (volume for
volume; v/v) FBS or Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium
(EMEM) and 10% (v/v) FBS. The human melanoma cell lines
C8161, 451Lu, WM164, WM35, WM793, and 1205Lu were
grown as described (19, 20). Pediatric tumor cell lines STS26T,
S462, S462-TY, ST88-14, T265, CMTRL-100, A673, and CRL11226 were maintained in DMEM with 10% (v/v) FBS and 1%
(v/v) penicillin/streptomycin. All other lines were maintained
in RPMI with 10% (v/v) FBS and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin. The identity of all nonprimary lines were conﬁrmed by
short tandem repeat ﬁngerprinting and were tested within a
few passages of initial description or authentiﬁcation.
DNA and RNA transfection
MEFs were transfected with either pEYFP-C1/Tm5NM1 or
pEYFP-C1/Tm5NM5 constructs using the Amaxa nucleofector
apparatus (program A-023) and MEF nucleofector kit 1 (Lonza)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. For siRNA transfections, SH-EP cells were transiently transfected with nonsilencing control, Tm5NM1/2 and Tm4 siRNA (Qiagen), as
previously described (13, 21, 22).
Generation of stable NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblast cell lines
NIH3T3 cells were grown to 50% conﬂuency in a 6-well plate
and then transfected with 3.75 mg per well Tm5NM1 tagged with
mCherry or afastTm tagged with yellow ﬂuorescent protein
(YFP) using lipofectamine LTX þ PLUS reagent (Invitrogen).
Cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 800 mg/mL
geneticin (Invitrogen), and clones were selected manually with a
pipette 14 days later. Once stably transfected cells were established, cells were maintained in culture medium containing 400
mg/mL geneticin.
Live imaging
SKN-Be2C and ACMs. Cells (2  104) and freshly isolated
cardiomyocytes were plated onto glass 35 mm glass bottom
microwell dishes (MatTek Cultureware). Control or drug-treated cells were imaged every 2 minutes for 30 to 60 minutes from
randomly set stage positions on an Olympus IX81 microscope
equipped with an environmental chamber heated to 37 C.
Images and movies were analyzed and processed using ImageJ
software.

Modeling
Modeling was done by Qubist Molecular Design Pty Ltd. For
detailed modeling information see Supplementary Materials
and Methods.
Microﬁlament disruption assay
Cells were seeded (5  103/well) into 8-well chamber slides
(NUNC) and treated with 10 mmol/L TR100 for 0 to 8 hours or
with 0 to 10 mmol/L TR100 for 24 hours using DMSO as vehicle
control. Actin was visualized with Alexa 555 conjugated phalloidin (Molecular probes), and Tm5NM1/2 was visualized with
g\9d (17) followed by anti-mouse Alexa 488 or Alexa 555
secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Random ﬁelds were
imaged using an Olympus IX81 microscope. Cells (n  50) were
scored on the basis of positive ﬁlament staining from n ¼ 3
independent experiments.
Immunoﬂuorescent imaging
Cells were seeded and immunostained as previously
described (17). Cells (n  100) were scored from n ¼ 3
independent experiments.
Cytotoxic compounds
The anti-tropomyosin compound TR100 was designed and
synthesized by T.A. Hill and A. McCluskey (23). Cytochalasin D
was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Compounds were solubilized in DMSO to give stock concentrations of 50 mmol/L
(TR100) and 4 mmol/L (cytochalasin D).
Biochemical fractionation of globular and ﬁlamentous
actin
The ratio of globular (G-) to ﬁlamentous (F-) actin was
determined using the G/F-actin assay kit (BK037) according to
manufacture's instructions (Cytoskeleton Inc.,). Brieﬂy, SH-EP
or MEF cells, seeded at 2.0  105 cells/10 cm plate, were treated
with TR100 for 24 hours. Cells were harvested in F-actin
stabilization buffer (LAS2) and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for
5 minutes to remove unbroken cells. Lysates were centrifuged
at 100,000  g for 1 hour at 37 C. Pellets were resuspended in

were treated with 0 or 2 mmol/L TR100 for 48 hours. Neurons
were ﬁxed and cells were costained for synaptophysin as a
presynaptic marker and ﬂuorophore-tagged phalloidin (postsynaptic marker) to visualize synaptic connection.

Pyrene–actin depolymerization assay
Rates of actin depolymerization were determined from
the change in pyrene–actin ﬂuorescence (excitation 365 nm,
emission 407 nm) measured using a Spectra Max M3 plate
reader (Molecular Devices). Tm5NM1 (10 mmol/L) was preincubated with TR100 for 10 minutes, before mixing with Factin (6 mmol/L, 35% pyrene labeled). Depolymerization was
initiated by diluting ﬁlaments 12-fold with F-actin buffer [100
mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 2 mmol/L MgCl2,
1 mmol/L EGTA, 0.2 mmol/L ATP, 0.5 mmol/L dithiothreitol
(DTT)], and ﬂuorescence was recorded every 30 seconds over 2
hours. Initial rates of depolymerization (V0) were determined
from the ﬁrst 600 seconds of ﬂuorescence, ﬁtted to a linear
regression model.

Flow cytometric analysis
SK-MEL-28 cells were seeded (1.5  105 cells/well) in 6-well
plates and treated with TR100 (0–10 mmol/L) for 2 to 24 hours.
Adherent and ﬂoating cells were harvested and pelleted by
centrifugation (300 g/5 minutes) at room temperature.
DNA fragmentation by propidium iodide staining. Cells
were ﬁxed and permeabilized with 500 mL of cold (20 C) 70%
(v/v) ethanol and treated with propidium iodide (50 mg/mL;
Sigma) and RNase A (2 mg/mL; Sigma).
Mitochondrial membrane potential change (Dcm) by
TMRE staining. Recovered cells were resuspended in phenol
red-free DMEM and stained with 100 nmol/L tetramethylrhodamine 9-ethylester (TMRE; (Molecular Probes) for 15 to 20
minutes as per manufacturer's instructions. Cell cycle and
TMRE ﬂuorescence was measured using a FACS Calibur
(Becton Dickson) and quantitated using FlowJo software.

Cell viability assays
Cells (1  103/well) were plated (96-well) and treated (48
hour) with anti-tropomyosin drug and viability measured
using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenylterazolium bromide MTT. Cell viability was normalized to control (vehicle
alone) and dose–response curves, and half maximal effective
concentration (EC50) values were determined using Graph Pad
Prism 5 (nonlinear regression sigmoidal dose–response variable slope).

Isolation and functional analysis of adult rat
cardiomyocytes
ACMs isolation and functional analysis were conducted as
previously described (28). Brieﬂy, unloaded cells were paced
(MyoPacer, IonOptix) to contract at a frequency of 1 Hz,
whereas sarcomere length was recorded following a baseline,
drug treatment, and recovery phase.

Clonogenic assays
siRNA-transfected cells were seeded 48 hours posttransfection into 6-well plates (250 cells/well). Media was changed
every 3 days for 7 to 10 days until visible colonies formed.
Colonies were ﬁxed and stained and the surviving fraction was
determined as previously described (24).
Melanoma spheroid cultures
Melanoma spheroids were prepared using the liquid overlay method as described (25, 26). Spheroids were treated with
TR100 for 72 hours at the concentrations indicated. Spheroids were washed in PBS before live-dead staining with 4
mmol/L calcein-AM and 0.5 mg.mL1 40 , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen) for 1 hour at 37 C. Images were
then taken using a Leica SP5 inverted confocal microscope.
Cell migration assays
SH-EP cells were grown in a 6-well plate until conﬂuent.
Monolayer was scraped with a p200 pipette tip and cells treated
with sublethal concentrations of TR100 (2.5 mmol/L) or cytochalasin D (20 nmol/L). Images were acquired at 0 and 15
hours, and the area of the wound was measured using ImageJ
software.
Long-term hippocampal cultures
Low-density long-term hippocampal neurons were prepared as previously described (27). After 19 days, in vitro cells

Histology and heart hypertrophy measurements
B16/F10 animal hearts (n ¼ 15 from each condition) were
ﬁxed in 10% (v/v) neutral buffered formalin for 24 hours.
Transverse sections of the hearts were embedded in parafﬁn
and serial sections (5 mmol/L), Massons Trichrome stained,
and assessed (blinded) for the presence of necrosis and/or
ﬁbrosis. Intraventricular septum thickness (IVS) was measured (mmol/L) for control and 30 mg/kg1 TR100-treated
animals.
Troponin I measurements
Mice were bled via the retro orbital sinus, and levels of
circulating troponin I were detected using a mouse cardiacspeciﬁc troponin I enzyme immunoassay (CTnI Elisa-MP
BioMedical).

tropomyosin levels, which accompany cellular transformation
in primary, immortalized, and transformed BJ ﬁbroblasts (29).
Cellular immortalization and transformation of the primary BJ
ﬁbroblasts lead to signiﬁcant decreases in HMW tropomyosins
(Tm2, Tm3, and Tm1) and LMW tropomyosin (Tm4) expression (Fig. 1B and C). A signiﬁcant increase in the level of LMW
Tm5NM1/2 was observed (Fig. 1B and C) indicating that
Tm5NM1/2 is the predominant tropomyosin isoform of these
transformed cells.
Endogenous tropomyosin levels were analyzed in a panel of
neuroblastoma and melanoma cell lines. Representative neuroblastoma cell lines included both nonmalignant (SH-EP,
SKN-SH, and SKN-AS) and malignant (IMR-32 and SKN-Be2C)
tumor cells (30). Although there was variation in the levels of
expression of the HMW tropomyosins (Tm6, Tm1, Tm2, and
Tm3), all cell lines expressed the LMW-Tm4 and Tm5NM1/2
(Fig. 1D). A similar trend was observed for the melanoma cell
lines. The panel of melanoma cell lines included 6 human
(C8161, 451Lu, WM164, WM35, WM793, 1205Lu, and SK-MEL28) and one mouse (B16/F10) melanoma cell line. The human
melanoma cell lines were derived from primary (WM35
and WM793), lymph node metastatic (WM164), and distant
metastatic (C8161, 451Lu, and 1205Lu) disease (http://www.
wistar.org/lab/meenhard-herlyn-dvm-dsc/page/melanomacell-lines-0). Only WM793, 1205Lu, and B16/F10 expressed
HMW tropomyosins. In contrast, all melanoma cell lines
expressed the LMW Tm4 and Tm5NM1/2 (Fig. 1E).
Tm5NM1/2 promotes tumor cell growth and survival
The role of the LMW Tm5NM1/2 and Tm4 in tumor cell
growth was tested in SH-EP neuroblastoma cells using siRNA
knockdown. A speciﬁc reduction was observed in Tm5NM1/2
and Tm4 siRNA protein expression levels (>50%; Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1C) with no corresponding compensation
from the other tropomyosin isoforms (Supplementary Fig. S1B
and S1D). Knockdown of Tm4 in SH-EP neuroblastoma cells
did not impact cell survival in a clonogenic assay (Fig. 1F),
whereas knockdown of Tm5NM1/2 resulted in a signiﬁcant
decrease in cell survival (Fig. 1G). These data suggest that
Tm5NM1/2 containing actin ﬁlaments are required for tumor
cell survival, and targeting these speciﬁc actin ﬁlaments compromises tumor cell growth.
Tm5NM1/2 as a therapeutic target
In this novel approach, we have designed a series of compounds against the cytoskeletal Tm5NM1/2. To discriminate
between functionally distinct actin ﬁlament populations, we
took advantage of the C-terminus sequence divergence
between the cytoskeletal Tm5NM1/2 and the muscle tropomyosin (aTmfast; Fig. 2A). Using homology modeling and the
Molsoft CICM's pocketﬁnder software, we identiﬁed a number
of potential compound-binding pockets in both proteins (Fig.
2B and C). Binding pockets unique to the C-terminus of
Tm5NM1 (red pocket highlighted in Fig. 2C) were then used
to screen a chemical library from which we identiﬁed the lead
anti-tropomyosin compound, TR100 (Fig. 2D). In silico modeling shows the predicted interaction of TR100 to the C-terminus
(9d exon) of Tm5NM1 (Fig. 2D).

www.aacrjournals.org

One difﬁculty in screening for compounds, which target a
coiled–coil protein such as tropomyosin, is that it is a structural
protein rather than an enzyme, so developing a high-throughput assay with an appropriate readout of "activity" is challenging. To screen for anti-tropomyosin compound "activity," we
used both a biochemical and cell biology approach. To ascertain whether there was a direct interaction of TR100 with the
target protein Tm5NM1, we used puriﬁed proteins to assess the
impact of TR100 on actin ﬁlament kinetics using a pyrene
model of actin ﬁlament depolymerization. Kostyukova and
Hitchcock (31) have previously shown tropomyosin to have a
role in inhibiting F-actin depolymerization, a ﬁnding that can
now be extended to Tm5NM1. In the presence of saturating
amounts of Tm5NM1, F-actin depolymerization was reduced
by approximately 40% over the time course measured (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Using this model, we investigated the
impact of TR100 on actin ﬁlament dynamics. The difference in
the rate of ﬁlament depolymerization (V0) between F-actin and
Tm5NM1-coated F-actin is negated by TR100 (Supplementary
Fig. S2B and S2C). These data show a direct interaction
between TR100 and Tm5NM1 resulting in enhanced actin
ﬁlament depolymerization in vitro.
To conﬁrm whether this impact on actin ﬁlament stability
held true in a cell system, we assessed actin solubility in normal
and transformed cells treated with TR100. Normal (MEFs) and
transformed (neuroblastoma SH-EP) cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of TR100 for 24 hours, and soluble
(G) versus insoluble (F) actin was quantiﬁed using a G:F actin
assay (Fig. 2E). Although we observed a shift in the solubility of
actin upon treatment with TR100 in both the normal and
transformed cells, the transformed SH-EP cells showed a more
signiﬁcant sensitivity to TR100 at both 5 and 7.5 mmol/L (Fig.
2F). This increase in actin ﬁlament solubility was also observed
using immunoﬂuorescence studies. MEFs and SH-EP cells
were treated with increasing concentrations of TR100 for 24
hours, and total actin ﬁlament (Fig. 2G) or Tm5NM1/2 (Fig. 2H)
organization was evaluated using the well-established microﬁlament disruption assay (32). Although there was a slight
decrease in actin and Tm5NM1/2-containing ﬁlament staining
in MEF cells treated with TR100 (Fig. 2G and H, top), TR100
treatment of the transformed SH-EP cells resulted in a significant disruption of both actin and Tm5NM1/2-containing
ﬁlaments in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2G and H, bottom).
Taken together, our data suggest that TR100 is more effective
in disabling the actin cytoskeleton of transformed cells than
normal cells.
TR100 selectively disrupts cytoskeletal Tm5NM1/2
containing actin ﬁlaments
Although treatment with TR100 severely impacted both the
total actin organization (Fig. 2G) and the integrity of Tm5NM1/
2-containing ﬁlaments (Fig. 2H), no signiﬁcant impact on the
organization of the microtubules was observed suggesting that
this compound preferentially targeted the actin microﬁlaments (Supplementary Fig. S3).

increasing doses (0, 0.1, 1, and 10 mmol/L) or for increasing time
(10 mmol/L for 0, 1, 4, and 8 hours) with TR100 showed an initial
preferential loss of LMW Tm5NM1/2-containing ﬁlaments
compared with the HMW tropomyosins (Supplementary Fig.
S4A–S4L). However, at higher dose and longer exposure times
of TR100, we did observe an increase in the number of cells
displaying no stress ﬁbers (Supplementary Fig. S4M, S4N, and
S4I–S4L). Although the cytoskeletal tropomyosins differ in the
amino terminus exon choice, all contain the carboxyl terminal
exon 9d. Therefore, this lack of absolute speciﬁcity of TR100 is
most likely due to the high degree of sequence similarity
between the 9d exon of the different tropomyosin genes (9).

From a clinical perspective, it may not be critical that the
anti-tropomyosin compounds discriminate between HMW
and LMW cytoskeletal tropomyosins. It is essential, however,
that these compounds are able to discriminate between the
actin ﬁlaments involved in tumor cell progression and those
that are crucial for sarcomeric integrity and contractile function. Cytoskeletal and muscle tropomyosins differ at the Cterminus due to alternative splicing of exon 9 (Fig. 2A). Live cell
imaging analysis was conducted on NIH3T3 ﬁbroblast cells,
which stably expressed either the cytoskeletal mCherryTm5NM1 or the muscle YFP-aTmfast. Cells were treated with
2 mmol/L TR100 and imaged for 24 hours. Representative

images at 0, 15, 19, and 24 hours are shown (Fig. 3A). Cells
expressing the cytoskeletal Tm5NM1 were more sensitive to
TR100 treatment as measured by a marked reduction at 24
hours in actin ﬁlament organization compared with cells
expressing the muscle aTmfast (Fig. 3A). To determine whether TR100 could discriminate between the 9a and 9d terminus,
MEFs were transiently transfected with constructs expressing
either a ﬂuorescently-tagged Tm5NM1 (exon 9d) or Tm5NM5,
a modiﬁed Tm5NM1 containing the C-terminus of muscle Tm
(exon 9a). MEFs overexpressing the Tm5NM1 (9d) were signiﬁcantly more sensitive to TR100 than cells overexpressing
Tm5NM5 (9a; Fig. 3B and C), both in terms of ﬁlament stability
and cell size. These initial experiments show that it is possible
to discriminate between cytoskeletal and muscle actin ﬁlament populations and target distinct actin ﬁlaments based on
the tropomyosin composition.

TR100 has minimal impact on differentiated cells
The expression of Tm5NM1/2 was undetectable in isolated
rat ACMs (Fig. 4A); therefore, we predicted that TR100 would
have minimal impact on the contractile function of an ACM.
Cardiotoxic effects of TR100 were assessed using a specialized
IonOptix Corp system, which is routinely used to measure realtime changes in sarcomere shortening of a contracting isolated
rat ACM (28, 33). Shown are representative contraction curves
(Fig. 4B). Alterations in peak shortening of the ACM sarcomere
was used to assess changes in contractile function in the
presence and absence of TR100 and a known cytoskeleton
disrupting agent cytochalasin D.
To establish an effective TR100 concentration for the functional experiments, live imaging analysis was conducted on
SKN-Be2C neuroblastoma cells in parallel with ACMs. TR100 at
10 mmol/L had a profound impact on both SKN-Be2C cell

adherence and viability as early as 6 minutes posttreatment
(Fig. 4C and E). In contrast, ACMs seemed to be structurally
intact (Fig. 4D and F). In functional studies, ACMs perfused
with 10 mmol/L TR100 for 6 minutes showed little to no change
in the contractile properties, which is represented by 87% of the
cells contracting normally (Fig. 4G). High-dose exposure of 50
mmol/L TR100 revealed toxicity in ACMs that was displayed as
reduced peak shortening (14%) and cessation of contraction
(14%; RPS and CC, respectively; Fig. 4G). In contrast, more than
87% of ACMs exposed to the ubiquitous actin destabilizing
drug cytochalasin D showed a profound decrease in contractile
shortening. TR100, unlike other actin-targeting compounds
such as cytochalasin D, does not acutely impact the contractile
function of isolated ACMs. This shows that it is possible to
develop anti-tropomyosin compounds, which can discriminate between the cytoskeleton and the contractile apparatus of
cardiac muscle.
Because Tm5NM1/2 is also required for neuronal function
(34), neurotoxicity is a potential side effect of TR100. To
determine the effect of TR100 on neuronal integrity, long-term
cultures of terminally differentiated hippocampal neurons
were incubated with increasing concentrations of TR100 and
the synapses visualized by staining for synaptophysin (presynaptic), F-actin (using phalloidin, postsynaptic), and DAPI to
visualize the nucleus (Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). TR100,
at a dose that was effective against SKN-Be2C tumor cells, had
no overt effect on neuronal cell viability as determined by the
integrity of their nuclei and the presence of neuronal synapses

(Supplementary Fig. S5C). This result raises the possibility that
TR100 may impact dividing cells at doses that have minimal
impact on terminally differentiated cells such as ACMs and
hippocampal neurons.
TR100 is effective in 2D and 3D tumor cell cultures
A representative transformed melanoma cell line (SK-MEL28; Fig. 5A–D) and a primary human melanocyte cell line (Fig.
5E–H) were treated with either DMSO (Fig. 5A, C, E, and G) or 5
mmol/L TR100 (Fig. 5B, D, F, and H) and Tm5NM1/2-containing ﬁlament organization evaluated using a microﬁlament
disruption assay. As observed with the MEF and SH-EP comparison (Fig. 2E–H), TR100 had a more signiﬁcant impact on
actin ﬁlament integrity in the transformed SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells than the primary human melanocytes (Fig. 5C vs. D,
G vs. H, respectively). This correlated with differences in
sensitivity of these cell lines to TR100 in cytotoxicity assays
(Fig. 5I), suggesting a strong correlation between Tm5NM1/2
ﬁlament disruption and efﬁcacy. The calculated EC50 values for
TR100 against SK-MEL-28 and melanocytes cell lines were 1.9
 0.08 mmol/L and 4.1  0.07 mmol/L, respectively. In addition
to the shift in EC50, we also observed a signiﬁcant difference in
the maximal response in both these cell lines. TR100 had a
reduced "killing effect" on the melanocytes with approximately
40% of cells remaining viable at the highest concentration of
TR100 compared with approximately 0% with the transformed
SK-MEL-28 cells (Fig. 5I). This change in maximal response is
likely to mask any signiﬁcant changes in the relative EC50 as

this represents the "effective concentration that provokes a

cell motility in spheroids grown from C8161 and 1205Lu cells
(both derived from distant metastases) as shown by a
decrease in live cells invading the collagen matrix. The
WM164 cell line showed only little invasion, which was also
inhibited at 3 mmol/L TR100. Interestingly, the effect on
invasion was less on spheroids derived from the primary
melanoma cell line WM793. At 10 mmol/L and 30 mmol/L
TR100, we saw a marked increase in tumor cell death in
spheroids of all melanoma cell lines, regardless of their stage
or phenotype, as shown by an increase in cells staining
positively for DAPI (Fig. 5K). In wound-healing assays, we
were also able to show that TR100, at sublethal concentrations, signiﬁcantly impacted wound closure in SH-EP neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 5J). This was a similar effect to what
was observed with the actin-targeting drug cytochalasin D.
This shows that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with
TR100 impacts both tumor cell motility and viability in
melanoma and neuroblastoma cells.
TR100 induces apoptosis
Cell-cycle analysis of SK-MEL-28 cells treated with TR100
resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in the sub G1 or dead cell
population (Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B). This sub G1
population signiﬁcantly increased with exposure to 10 mmol/L
TR100. This also correlated with an increase in levels of
cleaved PARP (Supplementary Fig. S6C), a downstream target
of the executioner caspase, caspase-3, which is activated
during programmed cell death (39). We also observed a
time-dependent increase in mitochondrial membrane permeability in SK-MEL-28 cells treated with TR100 as measured by a decrease in TMRE perchlorate ﬂuorescence (Supplementary Fig. S6D). These data suggest that TR100 induces
cell death most likely through the mitochondrial apoptotic
pathway.
TR100 inhibits tumor growth in melanoma and
neuroblastoma models
The efﬁcacy of TR100 was assessed in vivo using 3 animal
models: The B16/F10 murine melanoma model, the 1205Lu
metastatic human melanoma xenograft model, and the
CHP134 neuroblastoma xenograft model. In pilot experiments,
the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of TR100 was determined
for each genetic background of the mouse strains used for the
tumor experiments. MTDs were 30 mg/kg1 for C57BL/6 mice,
25 mg/kg1 for BALB/c mice, and 20 mg/kg1 for NOD/SCID
mice. The dose of TR100 administered was selected on the
basis of the dose that showed minimal adverse effects (data not
shown). Treatment with TR100 resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in tumor growth (mm3) compared with the vehicle control
in all 3 models (Fig. 6A–C). On termination of the B16/F10
experiment, tumors from control (n ¼ 6) and 30 mg/kg1 (n ¼
4) TR100-treated animals were harvested and proﬁled for
tropomyosin expression. We observed a signiﬁcant decrease
in the levels of Tm5NM1/2 in the 30 mg/kg1 treated animals
compared with the control-treated group with no detectable
changes to the expression proﬁle of the HMW Tm2 (Fig. 6D),
suggesting that long-term exposure to TR100 impacts the
expression level of the target Tm5NM1/2.

TR100 does not compromise the liver or heart in vivo
Targeting the actin cytoskeleton has the potential to cause
both liver (40) and cardiac toxicity (41). Bloods were harvested
from control and TR100-treated 1205Lu mouse xenograft
model. TR100 treatment resulted in no changes in the levels
of liver damage biomarkers ALP, AST, and ALT (Supplementary Fig. S7A) or the level of total bilirubin (Supplementary Fig.
S7B). These data indicate that TR100 does not impact liver
function. Manipulation of tropomyosin isoform contribution
to the heart may result in compensatory hypertrophy of the
cardiac muscle (41). Hearts were harvested from control and
TR100-treated B16/F10 animals, and the structural integrity of
the cardiac muscle was analyzed. Animals treated with TR100
showed no evidence of increased ﬁbrosis in Massons Trichrome stained sections (Fig. 7A) or acute cardiomyocyte
damage as measured by circulating blood troponin I levels
(Fig. 7B). There were no overt signs of hypertrophy as measured
by IVS (Fig. 7A and C) or changes in heart weight (Fig. 7D).
TR100 is therefore able to inhibit tumor growth at doses that do
not compromise the heart.

Discussion
Tropomyosin is an important regulator of the actin cytoskeleton (9, 42) and a key component of the actin microﬁlaments in tumor cells (1, 43). In this study, we have shown that
tropomyosin is necessary to provide the cytoskeletal structure
required for tumor cell survival. This ﬁnding is in accordance
with the studies investigating tropomyosin knockout mouse
models. Single knockout of the TPM1 (44), TPM2 (45), or TPM3
(46) gene resulted in embryonic lethality, suggesting that at
least 3 of the tropomyosin genes are providing nonredundant
functions essential for embryo development. A question now
being addressed by many research groups is what is the
functional role of speciﬁc tropomyosin isoforms? Studies done
by Tojkander and colleagues showed that knockdown of
different single isoforms of tropomyosin can inhibit stress
ﬁber formation in osteosarcoma cells, indicating that each
isoform contributes a speciﬁc functional capacity (13). There is
also increasing evidence in the literature to suggest that
tropomyosins deﬁne functionally distinct actin ﬁlaments by
regulating the recruitment and association of actin-binding
proteins in an isoform-speciﬁc manner (13–15, 47, 48). This
functional and spatial regulation of actin ﬁlaments has been
shown to be conserved from yeast (14, 15) to mammals (12, 47)
and provides a unique opportunity to target distinct actin
ﬁlaments based on the tropomyosin composition. In this study,
we designed anti-tropomyosin compounds that targeted the
cytoskeletal tropomyosins, in particular, LMW Tm5NM1/2.
These Tm5NM1-containing ﬁlaments were attractive targets
in terms of disabling the ﬁlaments involved in tumor cell
survival.
Understanding the mechanism by which these anti-tropomyosin compounds initiate tumor cell death is necessary for
therapeutic application. The actin cytoskeleton is believed to
have a role as both an initiator of apoptosis due to its role in the
maintenance of cellular integrity and also as an integral
component of the morphologic changes, which are a hallmark

of apoptosis (49). Actin-targeting drugs such as the cytochalasins or jasplakinolide have been widely used to induce
apoptosis in a variety of cell types (50) for many years, yet the
role actin has in controlling the initiation of apoptosis is only
now becoming apparent. Studies have shown that manipulating the G-F actin ratio can trigger apoptosis, but this seems to
be largely dependent on cell type (51). Previous studies have
shown that altering the level of tropomyosin impacts actin
polymer accumulation (52) and F-actin solubility (53). One
possibility is the anti-tropomyosin compounds, by altering
the associated tropomyosin, are changing the G-F actin ratio
and thereby triggering cell death. Alternatively, Puthalakath
and colleagues showed that both the treatment of cells with
cytochalasin D and induction of anoikis caused the liberation
of Bmf, a BH3-only pro-apoptotic protein that is sequestered to

the actin cytoskeleton (54). Therefore, disrupting the actin
cytoskeleton with the anti-tropomyosin compounds may
result in the dissociation of Bmf and the initiation of cell death
via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Although we know
that the anti-tropomyosin compounds initiate cell death, the
exact mechanism is still being elucidated.
Tropomyosins are widely expressed in many cell types of the
body. Knockout of just Tm5NM1/2 leads to 50% embryonic
lethality (with respect to 100% for the whole TPM3 gene) in
multiple mouse backgrounds indicating that it is required for
normal embryonic development (55). Nevertheless, if knockout
animals survive embryogenesis they have a normal lifespan
and display no cardiac phenotype (55). In this study, we have
also shown that the anti-tropomyosin compound, TR100, did
not impact differentiated cells. Taken together, this suggests

that targeting of just Tm5NM1/2 would be unlikely to have
toxicity to any extent approaching that of anti-actin drugs. The
ﬁrst-in-class anti-tropomyosin compounds we studied do target a range of cytoskeletal tropomyosins with an evolutionarily
conserved C-terminus, which may account for the toxicity
observed in the MTD studies. We are currently reﬁning the
drug design to achieve greater isoform speciﬁcity. This novel
approach and the development of the new class of antitropomyosin compounds may be the key for disabling a long
sought after target, the actin cytoskeleton. Development of
such agents holds enormous implications for the treatment of
cancers beyond neuroblastoma and melanoma.

Correction: A Novel Class of Anticancer
Compounds Targets the Actin Cytoskeleton in
Tumor Cells
In this article (Cancer Res 2013;73:5169–82), which was published in the August 15,
2013, issue of Cancer Research (1), the "Cytotoxic compounds" section on page 5170
was missing a reference and should read as follows:
The anti-tropomyosin compound TR100 was designed and synthesized by T.A.
Hill and A. McCluskey (23). Cytochalasin D was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Compounds were solubilized in DMSO to give stock concentrations of 50 mmol/L
(TR100) and 4 mmol/L (cytochalasin D).
The new reference #23 is as follows:
23. Hill TA, Gordon CP, McGeachie AB, Venn-Brown B, Odell LR, Chau N, et al.
Inhibition of dynamin mediated endocytosis by the Dynoles—synthesis and functional activity of a family of indoles. J Med Chem 2009;52:3762–73.
The references in the article have been renumbered accordingly. The authors
regret this error. The online version of the article has been corrected and no longer
matches the print.
