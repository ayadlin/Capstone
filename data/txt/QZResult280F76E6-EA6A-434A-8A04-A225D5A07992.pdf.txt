ABSTRACT
Adverse reactions to capecitabine-based chemotherapy limit full administration
of cytotoxic agents. Likewise, genetic variations associated with capecitabine-related
adverse reactions are associated with controversial results and a low predictive value.
Thus, more evidence on the role of these variations is needed. We evaluated the
association between nine polymorphisms in MTHFR, CDA, TYMS, ABCB1, and ENOSF1
and adverse reactions, dose reductions, treatment delays, and overall toxicity in 239
colorectal cancer patients treated with capecitabine-based regimens. The ABCB1*1
haplotype was associated with a high risk of delay in administration or reduction
in the dose of capecitabine, diarrhea, and overall toxicity. CDA rs2072671 A was
associated with a high risk of overall toxicity. TYMS rs45445694 was associated
with a high risk of delay in administration or reduction in the dose of capecitabine,
HFS >1 and HFS >2. Finally, ENOSF1 rs2612091 was associated with HFS >1,
but was a poorer predictor than TYMS rs45445694. A score based on ABCB1-CDA
polymorphisms efficiently predicts patients at high risk of severe overall toxicity (PPV,
54%; sensitivity, 43%) in colorectal cancer patients treated with regimens containing
capecitabine. Polymorphisms in ABCB1, CDA, ENOSF1, and TYMS could help to predict
specific and overall severe adverse reactions to capecitabine.

INTRODUCTION

and incorporating drug metabolites into DNA and RNA,
thus blocking DNA synthesis [3].
Capecitabine-treated patients commonly experience
severe, even fatal, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) at
some point during their treatment. These reactions often
lead to dose reductions, delays in administration, and
discontinuation of treatment [4, 5]. Although capecitabine
is a prodrug of 5-FU, its toxicity profile is significantly
different. While hematologic toxicity is most often
associated with 5-FU, side effects such as diarrhea,
nausea, vomiting, and hand-foot syndrome (HFS) are
more commonly associated with capecitabine [6].

Capecitabine is an oral fluoropyrimidine that
delivers 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) to the tumor [1]. Both
alone and in combination with other chemotherapeutic
and biological agents, capecitabine is increasingly used
in adjuvant and metastatic settings because it is easier to
administer and has a more favorable toxicity profile than
5-FU [1]. Since their discovery in 1957, fluoropyrimidines
have been the mainstay of treatment of colorectal cancer
(CRC), a major cause of morbidity in developed countries
[2]. 5-FU acts by inhibiting thymidylate synthase (TYMS)

The toxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs is affected
by factors such as age, performance status, organ
dysfunction, and the presence of other co-morbidities.
Interindividual genetic variability can also play an
important role [7]. Many genes, nucleotides, antigens, and
enzymes are known to be involved in the metabolism and
efficacy of the drugs used in treatment of CRC. In addition,
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) lead to various
outcomes in clinical practice [8]. Pharmacogenetics
evaluates the effect of genetic variations on the individual
response to and tolerability of therapy. Predicting the
individual risk of toxicity for a particular drug could
improve the quality of care. High-risk patients could be
candidates for lower doses or alternative drugs in order to
avoid toxicity [7]. Numerous gene polymorphisms have
been associated with capecitabine-induced toxicity. For
instance, DPYD variants have been extensively studied,
and dosing guidelines have been suggested [9, 10] (http://
www.pharmgkb.org/gene/PA166109594). However, the
low frequency of toxicity-related alleles and the relatively
frequent occurrence of severe ADRs to capecitabine
indicate that other factors are involved in the risk of ADR.
Laboratory tests have been designed for commercial or
research purposes to predict the risk of fluoropyrimidineinduced toxicity. Nonetheless, they have all proven to be
insufficiently accurate, thus stressing the need for new
markers [11].
Various polymorphisms in CDA, ABCB1, MTHFR,
and TYMS have been associated with capecitabineinduced ADRs, although findings are controversial and
the evidence poor [7, 11-22]. The relationship between
some of these genes and the development of toxicity to
capecitabine is not clear. For instance, a meta-analysis
describing an ENOSF1 SNP in linkage disequilibrium
with TYMS variants identified ENOSF1 as a putative
causal genetic variant for capecitabine-related toxicity
[11]. However, the authors suggest that this finding needs
to be confirmed in new cohorts.
We performed a prospective/retrospective study
of a cohort of CRC patients treated with capecitabinecontaining regimens in order to evaluate possible
associations between severe ADRs to capecitabine and
genomic variations in CDA, ABCB1, ENOSF1, TYMS,
and MTHFR.

equal to 1 is often followed by a change in the treatment
settings; therefore, we evaluated moderate-severe HFS
(grade >1, 22.6%) and severe HFS (grade >2, 6.3%).
Other frequently observed ADRs included severe diarrhea
(grade >2, 10.9%) and severe hematological toxicity
(grade >2, 7.1%).
Nine polymorphisms in five genes were genotyped
for the 239 patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria. No
significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
were detected, except for the SNP rs1045642 in ABCB1
(P=0.01). Therefore, analyses of ABCB1 were performed
using haplotype *1 (rs1128503 C, rs2032582 G, and
rs1045642 C). Univariate analysis revealed significant
associations between multiple severe ADRs and the
polymorphisms CDA rs2072671, TYMs rs45445694 and
rs34489327, ENOSF1 rs2612091, and ABCB1*1 (Table 2).
MTHFR rs1801133 and rs1801131 showed no significant
associations in this preliminary analysis and were therefore
ruled out for subsequent testing. This analysis enabled us
to identify putative risk alleles or variants.
Given the inherent low statistical power of this kind
of analysis and in order to obtain more robust significant
associations, we performed a binary logistic regression
analysis for those genotypes that initially rendered a
statistically significant result. In the multivariate analysis,
the P value was adjusted for sex, tumor stage, and hospital.
CDA rs2072671 was associated with overall toxicity
(any ADR classed as grade 3 or higher). Homozygous AA
patients presented a higher risk of overall toxicity than
AC or CC patients (OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.06-3; P=0.029)
(Table 3). A tendency toward HFS >2 was also observed
for this SNP, although it was not statistically significant.
The ABCB1 CGC haplotype for the SNPs
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

rs1128503, rs2032582, and rs1045642 (ABCB1*1),
respectively, was associated with the following delays
in starting chemotherapy (any cycle), dose reduction, or
withdrawal of capecitabine; severe diarrhea; and severe
overall toxicity (Table 3). The association between
ABCB1*1 and severe overall toxicity was particularly
relevant (OR, 4.06; 95% CI, 1.97-8.38; P<0.001).
TYMS 2R (rs45445694) was significantly associated
with moderate-severe HFS (grade >1) and severe HFS
(grade >2) (Table 3). The TYMS 6ins allele was also
associated with a higher risk of HFS >1 (P=0.011) and
HFS >2 (P=0.003) in the univariate analysis (Table 2),
although these associations disappeared after adjusting for
sex, hospital, and type of cancer (Table 3).
Homozygous AA individuals harboring ENOSF1
rs2612091 showed a higher risk of HFS >1 in the
univariate analysis (P=0.041). This association remained
statistically significant in the adjusted analysis (OR, 2.28;
95% CI, 1.10-4.76; P=0.027).
Given that CDA rs2072671 and ABCB1 haplotypes
(rs2072671, rs1128503, rs2032582, and rs1045642)
were both significantly associated with severe overall
toxicity, a CDA-ABCB1 score was calculated based on the
number of risk alleles (from 0 to 8). A CDA-ABCB1 score
>5 predicted overall toxicity with a positive predictive
value of 54.05%, negative predictive value of 68.48%,
sensitivity of 43.47%, and specificity of 76.87%.

toxicity to cytarabine, which is also metabolized by CDA
[31, 32]. In contrast to our findings, those of other studies
did not show a connection between this SNP and toxicity
induced by capecitabine [11, 22] and fluoropyrimidines
[33]. The variables considered responsible for these
discrepant results include differences in study design,
sample size, criteria for establishing a cut-off for severe
ADRs, as well as variations in concomitant medication
[34].
ABCB1 is an ATP-dependent drug efflux transporter
for a huge variety of substrates [35]. Although capecitabine
has not been clearly identified as one of them, ABCB1
expression has been associated with resistance to 5-FU in
modified cell lines [36]. The authors showed associations
between the haplotype ABCB1*1 and an increased
probability of reducing the dose of capecitabine, delaying
initiation of therapy, or withdrawing the drug altogether,
as well as of diarrhea and overall toxicity. Nevertheless,
we were not able to reproduce the association with HFS
previously obtained in a smaller cohort [20].
A score covering several polymorphisms located
in at least two genes has been designed to predict
adverse reactions to fluoropyrimidines. Afzal et al
used polymorphisms in TYMS and MTHFR to predict
gastrointestinal toxicity in 5-FU-treated patients [19],
while Rosmarin et al developed a test to predict overall
toxicity with polymorphisms in TYMS and DPYD in
capecitabine-treated patients [11]. Jennings et al suggested
a predictive test for early adverse events by analyzing
TYMP and DPYD variants as a signature (sensitivity of
45.5% and a positive predictive value of 39.9%) [33].
Our results for predicting overall toxicity using the CDAABCB1 score are similar to those obtained in the studies,
although they do not take into consideration the main
factor contributing to toxicity in fluoropyrimidine-based
treatments, namely, DPYD variants. All other authors have
included DPYD variants in their scores. In our preliminary
analyses, we genotyped three SNPs in DPYD, namely,
rs67376798, rs55886062, and rs3918290. However,
we found only two patients who were heterozygous for
rs67376798, and they did not experience any relevant
toxicity. Given the low frequency of DPYD variants and
our limited sample size, we decided not to include DPYD
variants in our score. We suggest that using CDA and
ABCB1 polymorphisms could improve the performance
of existing predictors for capecitabine-induced toxicity.
Alternatively, the novel strategy of using gene-specific
scores for different ADRs could help to improve the
prediction of a specific ADR. Identifying patients with
a very high risk for developing ADRs could be useful
when investigating new strategies, such as decreasing
chemotherapy dosage in order to reduce toxicity without
decreasing efficacy.
In summary, polymorphisms in TYMS, CDA,
ENOSF1, and ABCB1 are associated with ADRs to
capecitabine-based chemotherapy in CRC patients.

investigated to decrease the side effects of chemotherapy
[23, 24]. However, to date, no valid approaches have
been implemented in clinical practice. Identification
and validation of genetic biomarkers with the aim of
preventing severe ADRs to chemotherapeutic drugs could
prove crucial in helping oncologists to select the best
treatment for their patients. Since capecitabine is one of
the most commonly used drugs in the treatment of CRC, a
specific tool that would make it possible to predict the risk
of toxicity for individual patients would be very useful.
All the polymorphisms analyzed in this study have been
associated with toxicity in the literature. However, current
evidence is insufficient to apply those results in clinical
practice. In this study, we demonstrated that functional
genetic variants in TYMS, ENOSF1, and ABCB1 were
associated with severe toxicity.
The genetic polymorphisms rs34489327 and
rs45445694 in TYMS have been studied extensively to
determine the patient’s response to fluoropyrimidinebased chemotherapy, although fewer studies have focused
on their association with toxicity. In this cohort of
capecitabine treated CRC patients we found a correlation
between the TYMS polymorphism rs45445694 and HFS
(grade >1 and grade >2). This result confirms previous
findings, thus suggesting a clear association that could
increase the level of evidence for using these biomarkers
in clinical practice [11, 25-27].
ENOSF1 was recently proposed as a regulator of
TYMS expression via antisense mechanisms because
the sequences of both genes are complementary [11].
In addition, an association was found between ENOSF1
rs2612091 and capecitabine-related severe toxicity, mainly
HFS. Therefore, a more relevant role has been suggested
for ENOSF1—as opposed to TYMS—in capecitabinerelated toxicity. We observed an increased risk of HFS
grade >1 in patients carrying the G variant in homozygosis
in ENOSF1 rs2612091. However, this association did not
remain statistically significant when HFS grade >2 was
analyzed. The results in our cohort suggest that TYMS
rs45445694 (OR, 3.63) is a better predictor of severe HFS
than ENOSF1 rs2612091 (OR, 2.53).
We did not find any significant associations
between capecitabine-related toxicity and the MTHFR
polymorphisms 677C>T and 1298A>C. It has been
suggested that the effects of MTHFR are masked in
cases of high serum levels of active folate [28]. Although
capecitabine is not combined with leucovorin, greater
folate intake has been related to a Mediterranean diet, and
higher folate levels may explain the lack of effect of the
MTHFR polymorphisms 677C>T and 1298A>C [29].
We also found that CDA 79A>C was linked to
overall toxicity and observed a trend toward severe
diarrhea. CDA plays an important role in the conversion of
capecitabine to 5-FU, and variants in this gene have been
related to capecitabine-induced toxicity [11, 22, 30]. CDA
79A>C has been associated with CDA activity and with

Polymorphisms in CDA and ABCB1 should be added
to current models to predict overall toxicity. Therefore,

METHODS
Patients
Samples from patients were provided by the
oncology departments of two tertiary teaching hospitals
(Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón and
Hospital Universitario Doce de Octubre) and by HGM
BioBank, which is a member of ReTBioH. Samples
were processed following current procedures and frozen
immediately on reception. 
The inclusion criteria were diagnosis of CRC (any
stage), a previous capecitabine-containing regimen in any
line of treatment, and age over 18 years. The exclusion
criteria were as follows: noncompliance with any of
the inclusion criteria, kidney or liver damage prior to
treatment, and less than 2 months of treatment, unless
higher-grade severe ADRs occurred (grade ≥2 for HFS
and grade≥3 for the rest).
The demographic and clinical data collected
included sex, age, colon or rectal cancer, disease stage,
World Health Organization Performance Status score,
treatment setting (adjuvant or metastatic), and other
drugs received as part of the chemotherapy regimen.
Capecitabine-related adverse reactions including nausea
and vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, hematological toxicity,
anorexia, asthenia, and HFS were recorded and graded
according to the Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE) of the National Cancer
Institute. All patients were genotyped for polymorphisms
in the following genes: MTHFR, TYMS, CDA, ABCB1,
and ENOSF1. Associations between the polymorphisms
and the ADRs were analyzed. This study was conducted
in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and was
approved by the ethics committees of Hospital General
Universitario Gregorio Marañón (CEIC-A1) and Hospital
Universitario Doce de Octubre (CEIC-A11). Informed
consent was obtained from all patients.

DNA isolation
Genomic DNA was isolated from 200 µl of whole
blood using the High Pure PCR template preparation
kit (Roche Applied Sciences, Penzberg, Germany). The
DNA concentration was measured using a NanoDrop
spectrophotometer
(ThermoScientific,
Waltham,

of HaeIII and 1 µL of restriction buffer at 37°C for 1 h.
After this period, the enzyme was inactivated by heating
at 65°C for 15 min. Finally, the amplification products and
the products resulting from the digestion were analyzed
using the 2100 Bioanalyzer DNA1000 and the reagents
kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA).
Thus, the amplification of the region containing two
repeats of 28 bp corresponds to a 214-bp band while 3
repeats would correspond to a 242-bp band.
ENOSF1 rs2612091 was genotyped using a
TaqMan probe in a StepOne Plus Real Time PCR system
(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California, USA). Allele
discrimination was performed using StepOne software
v2.3.
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was analyzed to detect
deviations in genotype frequency [37].

All data were analyzed using the Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences v.15 (SPSS, Inc). A linear-bylinear association chi-squared test was used to study the
univariate associations between polymorphisms and the
grade of adverse events. A P value <0.05 was considered
statistically significant. The odds ratio (OR) and 95%
confidence intervals (CI) were reported in the multivariate
logistic regression models for associations that were
statistically significant in the univariate analysis. For
ABCB1 variants, we performed a haplotype-based test.
The variables analyzed in the models included genotype,
sex, tumor stage, and hospital.
Based on the results of the multivariate analysis,
a score test was designed based on the number of risk
alleles for overall toxicity in ABCB1 and CDA. Negative
and positive predictive values, specificity, and sensitivity
were calculated.
