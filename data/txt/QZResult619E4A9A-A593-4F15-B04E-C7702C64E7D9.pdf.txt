ADAM10 and ADAM17: New Players in Trastuzumab Resistance
Michael J. Duffy, John Crown and Maeve Mullooly
conferring resistance to trastuzumab [6].
Taken together, these 2 reports [2,6] suggest that
inhibition of ADAM10, ADAM17 or preferably both
ADAMs is a potential new approach for minimizing
resistance to trastuzumab. Currently, several ADAM10/17
inhibitors are available and indeed some of these have
shown anti-cancer activity in preclinical systems [3,7].
To our knowledge, only one of these has undergone
investigations in a clinical trial, for potential anti-cancer
activity, i.e., the dual ADAM10/17 inhibitor, INCB7839
(Incyte) [8]. Preliminary results suggest that this drug is
generally well tolerated with no major musculoskeletal
side effects or anti-EGFR-related side effects such as
skin rash. Furthermore, there were no reports of druginduced increases in liver enzymes, bone marrow
toxicity or increase in cardiomyopathy [8]. Evidence of
target inhibition was the finding that administration of
INCB7839 decreased shedding of different HER ligands
as well as the extracellular domain of HER2.
The time has now come to further investigate
ADAM10/17 inhibitors in animal models for minimizing
resistance to trastuzumab. Hopefully, the preliminary
results of Kong and colleagues [2,6] can be confirmed
and that we can then move on to clinical trials using
ADAM10/17 inhibitors in combination with trastuzumab.

The availability of the anti-HER2 monoclonal
antibody, trastuzumab (Herceptin) has transformed the
outcome of a subgroup of patients with breast cancer that
previously had a poor prognosis, i.e., those with HER2positive disease [1]. Although HER2 gene amplification/
overexpression is necessary for breast cancer patients
to receive trastuzumab, more than 50% of patients
positive for this biomarker are intrinsically resistant
to the treatment. Furthermore, almost all patients who
initially respond, develop resistance which frequently
occurs within the first year of treatment. Using mostly
preclinical models, several different mechanisms have
been proposed for conferring resistance to trastuzumab.
These include hyperactivation of the PI3K pathway (due
to PI3K mutations or PTEN loss), activation of alternative
pathways (SRC, IGFR1), increased levels of EGFR/HER
ligands and presence of HER2 isoforms [1].
In this issue of Oncotarget, Feldinger et al [2]
describe a potential new mechanism of acquired resistance
to trastuzumab, i.e., increased expression of ADAM10.
ADAM10, together with the related ADAM17, are
responsible for the release of all the ligands that bind
to, and activate the EGFR/HER family of proteins [3].
Thus, ADAM17 is the primary sheddase for TGF-alpha,
amphiregulin, HB-EGF, and epiregulin, while ADAM10
is believed to be primarily responsible for the release of
EGF and betacellulin [3]. Previous evidence implicated
high levels of these ligands in conferring resistance to antiHER2 therapies, including trastuzumab [4,5].
Feldinger et al [2] now reports that trastuzumab
increases ADAM10 levels in cell culture, in an animal
xenograft model and importantly, also in patients.
Furthermore, knockdown of ADAM10 or treatment with
a selective low molecular weight ADAM10 inhibitor
(INCB8765; Incyte) increased trastuzumab response in
both naïve and trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive cell
lines. This enhanced response appeared to result from the
inhibition of betacellulin release and subsequent reduced
activation of EGFR, although this was not investigated in
detail.
Consistent with these preclinical findings, the
authors showed, using a small number of patients, that
pretreatment ADAM10 levels were associated with a
poor response and shorter relapse-free interval following
treatment with trastuzumab. Previous research by the
same group implicated increased levels of ADAM17 in
