BACKGROUND: Mucositis is a highly significant, and sometimes dose-limiting, toxicity of cancer therapy. The goal of this systematic review was to update the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer and International Society of Oral Oncology
(MASCC=ISOO) Clinical Practice Guidelines for mucositis. METHODS: A literature search was conducted to identify eligible published
articles, based on predefined inclusion=exclusion criteria. Each article was independently reviewed by 2 reviewers. Studies were rated
according to the presence of major and minor flaws as per previously published criteria. The body of evidence for each intervention,
in each treatment setting, was assigned a level of evidence, based on previously published criteria. Guidelines were developed based
on the level of evidence, with 3 possible guideline determinations: recommendation, suggestion, or no guideline possible. RESULTS:
The literature search identified 8279 papers, 1032 of which were retrieved for detailed evaluation based on titles and abstracts. Of
these, 570 qualified for final inclusion in the systematic reviews. Sixteen new guidelines were developed for or against the use of various interventions in specific treatment settings. In total, the MASCC=ISOO Mucositis Guidelines now include 32 guidelines: 22 for oral
mucositis and 10 for gastrointestinal mucositis. This article describes these updated guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: The updated
MASCC=ISOO Clinical Practice Guidelines for mucositis will help clinicians provide evidence-based management of mucositis secondC 2014 The Authors. Cancer published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of Ameriary to cancer therapy. Cancer 2014;120:1453–61. V

Disclaimer: The Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer and International Society of Oral Oncology (MASCC=ISOO) Mucositis Guidelines are developed to facilitate the evidence-based management of mucositis. However, clinicians should also use their own judgment in making treatment decisions for individual patients. The guideline authors and the MASCC=ISOO do not guarantee or take responsibility for clinical outcomes in individual patients.
These guidelines refer to the use of the listed agents for the specific indication listed (ie, the prevention or treatment of mucositis or related symptoms). These
guidelines do not apply to the use of the listed agents for other indications. For example, although it is suggested that chlorhexidine mouthwash not be used
to prevent oral mucositis in patients receiving head and neck radiation therapy, clinicians may choose to use this agent for other indications in this or other
populations.

Review Article

INTRODUCTION
Mucositis refers to mucosal damage secondary to cancer
therapy occurring in the oral cavity; pharyngeal, laryngeal,
and esophageal regions; and other areas of the gastrointestinal tract. Mucositis can be caused by chemotherapy
and=or radiation therapy. It occurs in approximately 20%
to 40% of patients receiving conventional chemotherapy,
80% of patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy as
conditioning for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(HSCT), and nearly all patients receiving head and neck
radiation therapy (H&NRT).1-3 Oral mucositis presents
as erythema and=or ulceration of the oral mucosa. In
addition, the pharyngeal, laryngeal, and esophageal mucosa are also at risk for mucositis, particularly in patients
undergoing H&NRT. It is typically very painful, requiring opioid analgesics, and impairs nutritional intake and
quality of life.4,5 Gastrointestinal mucositis presents with
debilitating symptoms such as pain, nausea=vomiting,
and diarrhea.6 Severe mucositis can necessitate a reduction
in the chemotherapy dose or a treatment break in RT,
which can negatively influence prognosis.7,8 In addition,
mucositis has a considerable economic impact, due to
costs associated with symptom management, nutritional
support, management of secondary infection, and hospitalization.7,9 Thus, mucositis is a highly significant, and
sometimes dose-limiting, toxicity of cancer therapy.
Although direct cell damage from chemotherapy
and=or RT initiates the process, evidence suggests that the
pathogenesis of mucositis is more complex.10 A 5-stage
model has been proposed.11 Reactive oxygen species, second messengers, proinflammatory cytokines and pathways,
and metabolic byproducts of colonizing microorganisms
are all believed to play a role in amplifying the tissue
injury.12 As a result, a large number of diverse interventions
have been tested for mucositis. Although many of these
interventions are available over the counter or for off-label
use or marketed as devices, to the best of our knowledge
only 1 agent to date has been approved by the US Food
and Drug Administration as a drug for mucositis, albeit in
a relatively restricted population. Studies of many interventions range widely in quality, sometimes with conflicting
results. Therefore, there is a need for evidence-based clinical
practice guidelines for mucositis to guide clinicians on
which interventions are truly effective.
In 2004, the Mucositis Study Group of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer and International Society of Oral Oncology (MASCC=ISOO)
published what to our knowledge were the first evidencebased clinical practice guidelines for mucositis.13,14 The
first update of these guidelines was published in Cancer in
1454

2007.15 Over the last decade, other organizations have also
published guidelines for mucositis. The guidelines published
by the European Society for Medical Oncology are a direct
adoption of the MASCC=ISOO guidelines.16 The guidelines published by the US National Comprehensive Cancer
Network are an adaptation of the MASCC=ISOO guidelines, combined with expert opinion.17 Thus, the
MASCC=ISOO mucositis guidelines are the leading clinical
practice guidelines for this toxicity. Due to the large volume
of additional literature published since the last update, we
undertook the second revision of these guidelines, which is
presented here.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Our methods and the underlying considerations have
been described in detail in 2 recent publications.18,19 In
brief, we developed evidence-based guidelines based on
systematic reviews of the evidence for various interventions. A research librarian constructed search strategies
and conducted literature searches through the OVID
interface to Medline. Inclusion criteria were English language publications reporting testing of an intervention for
mucositis in humans, published in a peer-reviewed journal, and indexed in Medline on or before December 31,
2010. We excluded articles that did not report the effects
of an intervention on mucositis or mucositis-related outcomes (such as pain), animal or in vitro studies, and literature reviews. Due to the large number and diverse range
of interventions, the reviewers and articles were organized
into 8 clinical sections. One section focused on gastrointestinal mucositis and 7 sections examined the following
classes of interventions for oral mucositis: 1) basic oral
care; 2) growth factors and cytokines; 3) antiinflammatory
agents; 4) antimicrobials, coating agents, anesthetics, and
analgesics; 5) laser and other light therapy; 6) cryotherapy;
and 7) natural and miscellaneous agents. Each of the 8 sections had a section head,  1 co-section heads, and 5 to
10 reviewers. All participants were calibrated to ensure
consistency in the application of the review criteria. In
addition, reviewers and section heads were provided with
role-specific written instructions and a manual detailing
the procedures. Each article was independently reviewed
by 2 reviewers. Each reviewer extracted and entered up to
66 fields of data per article into an electronic reviewer
form. The quality of the reviewed literature was assessed
by identifying major and minor flaws as per the criteria
published by Hadorn et al (see online supporting information).20 These criteria specify major and minor flaws
for 8 study design variables: selection of patients, allocation to groups, therapeutic regimen, study administration,

withdrawals, blinding, outcome measurement, and statistical analysis. The section heads finalized the reviews of
each article and adjudicated discrepancies between the 2
reviewers. Then the overall body of evidence for each
intervention, in each treatment setting, was evaluated and
assigned a level of evidence, based on criteria published by
Somerfield et al (Table 1).21 These criteria allocate levels
of evidence based on the type of study and according to
whether a study is well designed. To minimize subjectivity, we defined a “well-designed study” as a study with no
major flaws, as per the criteria of Hadorn et al.20 The level
of evidence for each intervention was then translated into
a provisional guideline, based on criteria published by
Somerfield et al (Table 2).21 There were 3 possible categories: “recommendation,” “suggestion,” or “no guideline
possible.” Level I or II evidence was required to support a
recommendation, which could only be achieved by  1
randomized controlled trials without any major flaws. A
suggestion was possible for lower-level evidence but only
with consistent evidence from multiple studies and panel
consensus on the interpretation of this evidence. When
adequate evidence demonstrated the lack of efficacy of an
agent, a guideline “against” the use of that agent was
developed. The provisional guidelines were discussed and
finalized at a full-day, in-person guidelines meeting
attended by > 60 members of the panel and 2 independent observers.
RESULTS
The literature search identified 8279 articles, 1032 of
which were retrieved for detailed evaluation based on titles
and abstracts; of these, 570 articles qualified for final
inclusion in the systematic reviews (see online supporting
information). Less than 5% of all studies reviewed were
determined to have no major flaws, as per the criteria of

treatment of mucositis and the specific patient population
it applies to). For more detailed results of each section,

Gastrointestinal Mucositis (Not Including the
Oral Cavity)

The previous version of the MASCC=ISOO guidelines
for gastrointestinal mucositis included guidelines in favor
of amifostine, octreotide, sucralfate enemas, and sulfasalazine in specific treatment settings (Table 3). In addition,
it included guidelines against the use of 5-acetyl salicylic
acid and related compounds and oral sucralfate. Based on
the present systematic review, these prior guidelines were
able to be continued with no changes. One previous
guideline, which was against the use of systemic glutamine
for the prevention of gastrointestinal mucositis in patients
receiving standard-dose and high-dose chemotherapy, was
changed to “No guideline possible,” based on the incorporation of newer evidence. In addition, 3 new guidelines
were developed:1) a suggestion in favor of hyperbaric oxygen to treat radiation-induced proctitis; 2) a suggestion
for probiotic agents containing Lactobacillus species for
the prevention of chemotherapy and radiation-induced
diarrhea in patients with pelvic malignancy; and 3) a recommendation against the use of misoprostol suppositories
for the prevention of acute radiation-induced proctitis
(Table 3).22 Due to inadequate and=or conflicting evidence, no guideline was possible for several agents
reviewed, including activated charcoal, balasalazide, budesonide, cefixime, celecoxib, cholestyramine=levofloxacin,
chrysin, circadian rhythm, formalin, heater probes, leucovorin, metronidazole, neomycin, palifermin, physical
activity, and sodium butyrate.

RECOMMENDATIONS IN FAVOR OF AN INTERVENTION (ie, strong evidence supports effectiveness in the treatment setting listed):
1. The panel recommends that intravenous amifostine be used, at a dose of 340 mg/m2, to prevent radiation proctitis in patients receiving radiation
therapy (II).
2. The panel recommends that octreotide, at a dose of 100 lg subcutaneously twice daily, be used to treat diarrhea induced by standard- or highdose chemotherapy associated with HSCT, if loperamide is ineffective (II).
SUGGESTIONS IN FAVOR OF AN INTERVENTION (ie, weaker evidence supports effectiveness in the treatment setting listed):
1. The panel suggests that intravenous amifostine be used to prevent esophagitis induced by concomitant chemotherapy and radiation therapy in
patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (III).
2. The panel suggests that sucralfate enemas be used to treat chronic radiation-induced proctitis in patients with rectal bleeding (III).
3. The panel suggests that systemic sulfasalazine, at a dose of 500 mg administered orally twice a day, be used to prevent radiation-induced enteropathy
in patients receiving radiation therapy to the pelvis (II).
4. The panel suggests that probiotics containing Lactobacillus species be used to prevent diarrhea in patients receiving chemotherapy and/or radiation
therapy for a pelvic malignancy (III).
5. The panel suggests that hyperbaric oxygen be used to treat radiation-induced proctitis in patients receiving radiation therapy for a solid tumor (IV).
RECOMMENDATIONS AGAINST AN INTERVENTION (ie, strong evidence indicates lack of effectiveness in the treatment setting listed):
1. The panel recommends that systemic sucralfate, administered orally, not be used to treat gastrointestinal mucositis in patients receiving radiation therapy for a solid tumor (I).
2. The panel recommends that 5-acetyl salicylic acid (ASA), and the related compounds mesalazine and olsalazine, administered orally, not be used to
prevent acute radiation-induced diarrhea in patients receiving radiation therapy for a pelvic malignancy (I).

Level of evidence for each guideline is in brackets following the guideline statement.

Oral Mucositis
Basic oral care

The results of the current systematic review indicated that
most studies examining the use of oral care protocols for the
prevention of oral mucositis reported a beneficial effect.
These protocols typically included a combination of toothbrushing, flossing, and  1 mouth rinses to maintain oral
hygiene. Although the evidence was not strong enough to
support a recommendation, there was adequate positive evidence to support a suggestion in favor of using oral care protocols for the prevention of oral mucositis across all cancer
treatment modalities (Table 4). The evidence also supported a suggestion against the use of chlorhexidine mouthwash for the prevention of oral mucositis in patients
receiving H&NRT. No guideline was possible regarding
the use of oral care protocols for the treatment of oral mucositis. In addition, no guideline was possible related to the
individual use of the following mouth rinses: saline, sodium
bicarbonate, mixed medication mouthwashes, calcium
phosphate, and chlorhexidine in patients receiving chemotherapy, due to inadequate and=or conflicting evidence.31
Growth factors and cytokines

To the best of our knowledge, palifermin (keratinocyte
growth factor-1) is the only agent that has been approved
as a drug by the US Food and Drug Administration and
the European Medicines Agency for oral mucositis. Evidence included a large, well-designed, randomized controlled trial and other supporting studies.32 The previous
1456

version of the MASCC=ISOO guidelines for oral mucositis included a recommendation in favor of this agent for
the prevention of oral mucositis in patients receiving
high-dose chemotherapy and total body irradiation followed by autologous stem cell transplantation for hematological malignancies. Based on the current systematic
review, this recommendation was continued with no
change in the target population (Table 4). The evidence
reviewed also continued to support a suggestion against the
use of granulocyte-macrophage–colony-stimulating factor
mouthwash for the prevention of oral mucositis in patients
undergoing autologous or allogeneic HSCT. Furthermore,
the use of granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor during
H&NRT has been associated with reduced local tumor control.33 Due to inadequate and=or conflicting evidence, no
guideline was possible for the following agents reviewed: palifermin and granulocyte-macrophage–colony-stimulating
factor in treatment settings other than that listed above,
fibroblast growth factor-20, keratinocyte growth factor-2,
granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor, transforming
growth factor-b, epidermal growth factor, milk-derived
growth factor extract, interleukin-11, ATL-104, and
recombinant human intestinal trefoil factor.23
Antiinflammatory agents

Benzydamine hydrochloride is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug that can inhibit the production of
proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis
factor-a and interleukin-1b. The previous version of

RECOMMENDATIONS IN FAVOR OF AN INTERVENTION (ie, strong evidence supports effectiveness in the treatment setting listed):
1. The panel recommends that 30 min of oral cryotherapy be used to prevent oral mucositis in patients receiving bolus 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy (II).
2. The panel recommends that recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor-1 (KGF-1/palifermin) be used to prevent oral mucositis (at a dose of 60
lg/kg per day for 3 days prior to conditioning treatment and for 3 days after transplant) in patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy and total body
irradiation, followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, for a hematological malignancy (II).
3. The panel recommends that low-level laser therapy (wavelength at 650 nm, power of 40 mW, and each square centimeter treated with the required
time to a tissue energy dose of 2 J/cm2), be used to prevent oral mucositis in patients receiving HSCT conditioned with high-dose chemotherapy, with
or without total body irradiation (II).
4. The panel recommends that patient-controlled analgesia with morphine be used to treat pain due to oral mucositis in patients undergoing HSCT (II).
5. The panel recommends that benzydamine mouthwash be used to prevent oral mucositis in patients with head and neck cancer receiving moderate
dose radiation therapy (up to 50 Gy), without concomitant chemotherapy (I).
SUGGESTIONS IN FAVOR OF AN INTERVENTION (ie, weaker evidence supports effectiveness in the treatment setting listed):
1. The panel suggests that oral care protocols be used to prevent oral mucositis in all age groups and across all cancer treatment modalities (III).
2. The panel suggests that oral cryotherapy be used to prevent oral mucositis in patients receiving high-dose melphalan, with or without total body irradiation, as conditioning for HSCT (III).

without concomitant chemotherapy, for head and neck cancer (III).
4. The panel suggests that transdermal fentanyl may be effective to treat pain due to oral mucositis in patients receiving conventional or high-dose
chemotherapy, with or without total body irradiation (III).
5. The panel suggests that 2% morphine mouthwash may be effective to treat pain due to oral mucositis in patients receiving chemoradiation for head
and neck cancer (III).
6. The panel suggests that 0.5% doxepin mouthwash may be effective to treat pain due to oral mucositis (IV).
7. The panel suggests that systemic zinc supplements administered orally may be of benefit to prevent oral mucositis in oral cancer patients receiving
radiation therapy or chemoradiation (III).
RECOMMENDATIONS AGAINST AN INTERVENTION (ie, strong evidence indicates lack of effectiveness in the treatment setting listed):
1. The panel recommends that PTA (polymyxin, tobramycin, amphotericin B) and BCoG (bacitracin, clotrimazole, gentamicin) antimicrobial lozenges and
PTA paste not be used to prevent oral mucositis in patients receiving radiation therapy for head and neck cancer (II).
2. The panel recommends that iseganan antimicrobial mouthwash not be used to prevent oral mucositis in patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy,
with or without total body irradiation, for HSCT (II), or in patients receiving radiation therapy or concomitant chemoradiation for head and neck cancer
(II).
3. The panel recommends that sucralfate mouthwash not be used to prevent oral mucositis in patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer (I), or in
patients receiving radiation therapy (I) or concomitant chemoradiation (II) for head and neck cancer.
4. The panel recommends that sucralfate mouthwash not be used to treat oral mucositis in patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer (I), or in patients
receiving radiation therapy (II) for head and neck cancer.

Review Article
Antimicrobials, coating agents, anesthetics, and
analgesics

Several topical antimicrobial agents have been examined
for the treatment of oral mucositis with either negative or
mixed results. The evidence reviewed supported the continuation of a recommendation against the use of lozenges
containing polymyxin, tobramycin, and amphotericin
and bacitracin, clotrimazole, and gentamicin as well as
polymyxin, tobramycin, and amphotericin paste for the
prevention of oral mucositis in patients receiving
H&NRT. A new recommendation was developed against
the use of iseganan mouthwash in patients receiving
HSCT or H&NRT. We reviewed 20 studies examining
the use of the mucosal coating agent sucralfate in various
settings. The evidence supported recommendations
against the use of sucralfate for the prevention or treatment of oral mucositis in patients receiving chemotherapy
and also in patients receiving H&NRT. No guideline was
possible for any anesthetic agent reviewed due to inadequate evidence. Guidelines were developed in favor of
the use of patient-controlled analgesia with morphine,
transdermal fentanyl, morphine mouth rinse, and doxepin mouth rinse for the management of oral mucositis
pain in specific treatment settings (Table 4). Agents for
which no guideline was possible included acyclovir, clarithromycin, nystatin, kefir, povidone-iodine, fluconazole,
sodium hyaluronate topical, tetracaine, dyclonine, MGI209 (with benzocaine), cocaine, amethocaine, capsaicin,
methadone, ketamine, nortryptyline, and gabapentin.26
Laser and other light therapy

We reviewed 24 studies evaluating the effects of laser or
other light therapy on oral mucositis. The evidence supported the development of 2 new guidelines: a recommendation in favor of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) for
the prevention of oral mucositis in patients receiving
high-dose chemotherapy for HSCT with or without
total body irradiation,34 and a suggestion for LLLT in
the prevention of oral mucositis in patients receiving
H&NRT without concomitant chemotherapy (Table
4).35 No guideline was possible related to the use of
LLLT in any other treatment setting, or related to the
use of other emerging light modalities such as lightemitting diodes and visible light.27
Cryotherapy

A total of 22 eligible studies examined the placement
of ice chips in the mouth during the delivery of chemotherapy. The evidence supported the continuation of
a recommendation for the use of cryotherapy for the
1458

prevention of oral mucositis in patients receiving bolus
dosing of 5-fluorouracil. A suggestion for the use of
cryotherapy in patients receiving high-dose melphalan
as conditioning for HSCT was revised to clarify that
this applies regardless of the use of concomitant total
body irradiation. No guidelines related to cryotherapy
were possible in other treatment settings due to inadequate evidence.28
Natural and miscellaneous agents

Zinc is an essential trace element that is required for some
tissue repair processes. Zinc also has an antioxidant effect.
We reviewed 3 discrete studies testing zinc supplementation in patients receiving H&NRT, all of which found a
positive effect. A new suggestion was developed in favor of
zinc in patients with oral cancer undergoing RT or chemoradiation.36,37 However, there is some evidence indicating that the use of antioxidants in smokers during
H&NRT may reduce the efficacy of the RT.38 The evidence reviewed supported the continuation of a recommendation against the use of intravenous glutamine for
the prevention of oral mucositis in patients receiving
high-dose chemotherapy for HSCT (Table 4). Due to
inadequate and=or conflicting evidence, no guideline was

reviewed, including glutamine in other treatment settings,

Pilocarpine is a cholinergic agonist that stimulates
salivary secretion. The present systematic review supported 2 new suggestions against the use of systemic pilocarpine specifically for the prevention of oral mucositis:
during H&NRT and in patients receiving high-dose
chemotherapy, with or without total body irradiation,
before HSCT (Table 4). It should be noted that these
guidelines apply only to the use of pilocarpine for the prevention of mucositis. Pilocarpine can be beneficial to
increase salivary flow, particularly in patients treated with
H&NRT who are experiencing hyposalivation. The evidence also supported the continuation of a suggestion
against the use of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor pentoxifylline for the prevention of oral mucositis in patients
undergoing bone marrow transplantation. Due to inadequate and=or conflicting evidence, no guideline was possible in relation to other miscellaneous agents=modalities
reviewed including allopurinol, midline mucosa-sparing
radiation blocks, payayor, timing of RT, bethanechol,
chewing gum, propantheline, and tetrachlorodecaoxide.30

MASCC=ISOO Mucositis Guidelines/Lalla et al

DISCUSSION
To ensure consistency in the application of review criteria
and guideline development, we reviewed the entire body
of evidence for each intervention, not just the new publications since the last guidelines update. Our methodology
provides confidence that the evaluation of the literature
and subsequent guidelines development across various
interventions are based on uniform and transparent criteria. The present systematic review resulted in the development of 16 new guidelines for or against the use of various
interventions in specific treatment settings. Thus, the clinical usefulness of these guidelines should continue to
increase. However, it is recognized that there are many
clinical situations faced by the practitioner that are not
addressed by these guidelines, due to inadequate and=or
conflicting evidence. This constitutes a limitation of such
strictly evidence-based guidelines. Therefore, symptom
management (such as pain control and nutritional support) continues to be an important part of any mucositis
management strategy.
An important new guideline developed in the present update is the new recommendation (based on level II
evidence) in favor of LLLT for the prevention of oral
mucositis in patients receiving HSCT conditioned with
high-dose chemotherapy. In addition, a new suggestion
(based on level III evidence) was developed in favor of
LLLT for the prevention of oral mucositis in patients
undergoing H&NRT, without concomitant chemotherapy. However, patients now typically receive H&NRT
with concomitant chemotherapy, and no guideline was
possible in that population due to inadequate evidence.
Although the majority of studies of LLLT demonstrate a
benefit, the variable quality of the studies and the wide
variation in laser parameters used complicates the evaluation of the evidence.27 Animal studies indicate that LLLT
promotes wound healing and has an antiinflammatory
effect.39,40 Barriers to the acceptance of this technology
include the cost of laser equipment and the laborintensiveness of this modality (because many regimens
involve the daily treatment of patients). In addition, a modality such as LLLT can only act on mucosa by direct contact. It will not be useful for areas such as pharyngeal,
laryngeal, or esophageal mucosa, which are also at risk of
mucositis in patients receiving H&NRT, but are difficult
to directly access.
Sucralfate is a generically available mucosal coating
agent. We reviewed 20 studies that clearly demonstrated a
lack of benefit for sucralfate in the prevention or treatment of oral mucositis secondary to chemotherapy or
RT.26 Although it appears theoretically feasible that such
Cancer

a protective coating can protect the exposed nerve endings
and thus reduce pain, the data regarding sucralfate did not
provide support for such a beneficial effect. Recently,
several proprietary mucosal coating agents have been marketed as devices for oral mucositis. Our literature search
identified only 1 eligible published study of one of these
agents, on the basis of which no guideline was possible.
The goal of such clinical practice guidelines is to
improve clinical outcomes by facilitating evidence-based
care. To achieve this, it is important for the guidelines to
be widely disseminated and, most importantly, adopted
into routine practice. Strategies to facilitate guidelines
uptake can include open-access publication of the
guidelines-related articles and translations into other languages, as well as online resources, including a version
suitable for viewing on a smartphone. MASCC=ISOO is
also in discussions with relevant organizations to determine
how we can work together to minimize duplication of
effort and promote the clinical use of supportive care guidelines. The motto of the MASCC=ISOO is “Supportive
care makes excellent cancer care possible.” In keeping with
this, MASCC=ISOO is committed to enhancing the supportive care of oncology patients, with the goal of improving the patient experience and allowing for the delivery of
optimal cancer treatment.
