ABSTRACT:
PKCβ and Plk1 are fascinating targets in cancer therapy. Therefore, we combined
Enzastaurin targeting PKCβ and SBE13 targeting Plk1 to test synergistic effects in
cells with different p53 status. We analyzed cell proliferation and apoptosis induction,
and did Western blot and FACScan analyses to examine the combined PKCβ and Plk1
inhibition. p53-wild-type cells are more resistant to the combinatorial treatment than
p53-deficient cells, which displayed a synergistic reduction of cell proliferation after
the combination. HeLa, MCF-7 and HCT116p53wt and HCT116p53-/- cells differed in their
cell cycle distribution after combinatorial treatment in dependence on a functional
p53-dependent G1/S checkpoint (p53-deficient cells showed an enrichment in S
and G2/M, p53-wild-type cells in G0/G1 phase). hTERT-RPE1 cells did not show the
synergistic effects of cancer cells.
Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that Plk1 inhibition using SBE13
enhances the effects of Enzastaurin in cancer cells. HCT116p53wt and HCT116p53-/- cells
confirmed the p53-dependence of different effects after Plk1 and PKCβ inhibition
observed in HeLa and MCF-7 cells. Obviously, p53 protects cells from the cytotoxicity
of Enzastaurin in combination with SBE13. For that reason this combination can be
useful to treat p53-deficient cancers, without displaying toxicity to normal cells, which
all have functional p53.

INTRODUCTION

[1]. The serine/threonine kinase GSK3β, a target of PKCβ,
is a key regulator of multiple signaling pathways [2] and
is also often activated in tumors. Phosphorylation of
GSK3β by PKCβ promotes cell proliferation by inhibiting
cell cycle regulators [3]. In addition, PKCβ suppresses
apoptosis by phosphorylating GSK3β on Serine 9 and
promotes (endothelial) cell proliferation [4,5]. The PKC
signaling pathway plays an important role in tumorinduced angiogenesis, tumor growth, differentiation,
cytokine secretion, migration and apoptosis.
Enzastaurin (LY317615.HCl) is an ATP-competitive
selective inhibitor for PKCβ [6,7]. It is known, that
Enzastaurin reduces cell proliferation by inhibition of the
PKCβ signaling pathway [7]. The activity of the serine/
threonine kinase AKT, which promotes cell proliferation

One of the main research fields in translational
cancer research is the search for new therapeutic strategies.
Many strategies target one or more cancer-related genes
and try to inhibit cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting
the expression or activity of these genes. One promising
strategy to achieve this goal is the use of small molecule
kinase inhibitors, which represent essential tools in basic
and translational research.
One cancer related gene family is the Protein Kinase
C family (PKC) and one crucial family member is PKCβ,
a component of the VEGF signaling pathway, which
promotes tumor angiogenesis. PKCβ over-expression and
elevated activity is observed in a variety of cancer types

by inhibiting cell cycle inhibitors [3], is reduced under
these circumstances via the inhibition of PKCβ [8].
Enzastaurin is used as a single agent or in combination with
chemotherapeutic agents, targeted therapies or irradiation
(combination with Pemetrexed [9], with Gemcitabine or
Cisplatin [10] or with irradiation [4,11,12]). There are
also successful trials in combination with other targeted
GSK3β inhibitors [13] or with anti-neoplastic agents [14].
Enzastaurin is currently investigated in clinical trials phase
I, II and III, because it is well-tolerated and first results
suggested it to serve as a good platform for combinational
drug therapies [15-17].
The second target gene, which attracts increasing
attention in the fields of signaling research and cancer
therapy, is the serine/threonine kinase Plk1 (polo-like
kinase 1) [18], because it shows elevated activity in
all human tumors [19-21]. Plk1 plays a pivotal role for
mitosis especially of cancer cells and thus as a measure
for the aggressiveness of a tumor [22]. Plk1 has pre­
dictive and prognostic value for patients with diverse
cancers [22,23]. The importance of Plk1 as a measure for
the aggressiveness of a tumor results from its important
role for the mitotic checkpoints of cancer cells [24-28].
Interfering with Plk1 activity and/or expres­sion with
dominant-negative mutants, antibody microinjection,
antisense oligonucleotides or small interfering RNAs leads
to dif­ferent mistakes in centrosomal maturation, mitotic
catastrophe, increased apoptosis and tumor inhibition in
cancer cells [23,27,29-38]. In addition to its role during
mitosis, Plk1 has multiple functions outside of mitosis.
Plk1 is for example necessary for checkpoint recovery
after DNA damage [23,39] and is required for G1/S phase
[40].
SBE13 is a selective type II Plk1 inhibitor which is
able to induce a delay in cell cycle progression, to reduce
cell proliferation and to induce apoptosis in a broad range
of human cancer cell lines [33,34]. SBE13 displayed
1,000-fold selectivity towards Plk family members with
only marginal reduced kinase activity of Plk2 and Plk3
and did not influence Aurora A activity. SBE13 displayed
a differential effect between cancer and primary cells [41],
confirming earlier studies using Plk1-specific siRNAs
[35,38]. The PKCβ inhibitor Enzastaurin also inhibits
tumor cell proliferation, but not of untransformed colonic
epithelial cells [42]. For that reason, the combination of
Plk1 and PKCβ inhibitors might be a promising tool in
cancer therapy.
The aim of the current study was to investigate
the effects of the combination of Enzastaurin with the
Plk1 inhibitor SBE13 on the induction of apoptosis, the
reduction of cancer cell proliferation, and on the cell cycle
distribution of cancer cells and one immortalized, but not
transformed cell line. Furthermore we analyzed the effects
of the combined PKCβ and Plk1 inhibition on the protein
expression of important target proteins. We used different
cancer cell lines including the isogenic HCT116p53wt and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

HCT116p53-/- cells and hTERT-RPE1 cells, because they
have a different p53 status.

RESULTS
PKCβ expression levels in HeLa and MCF-7 cells
PKCβ over-expression and elevated activity is
observed in a variety of human tumors. In first studies, we
did western blot analyses with untreated control lysates
to elucidate differences in PKCβ expression in HeLa
and MCF-7 cells, demonstrating higher PKCβ protein
expression in HeLa cells compared to MCF-7 cells (data
not shown). Next we investigated the effect of Enzastaurin
on PKCβ protein levels in HeLa cells to determine whether
the PKCβ inhibitor influences not only the activity, but
also the protein levels of PKCβ. As expected, total PKCβ
protein was not affected by the treatment with either
Enzastaurin alone or with the combination of Enzastaurin
and SBE13 (data not shown).

Reduced phosphorylation of GSK3β on S9 in
HeLa and MCF-7 cells
In untreated cells GSK3β is a target of PKCβ and
it is phosphorylated on serine 9 by PKCβ to prevent
apoptosis. To analyze whether Enzastaurin inhibits PKCβ
activity in HeLa and in MCF-7 cells, we determined
phospho-GSK3β protein after treatment with increasing
Enzastaurin concentrations and with the combination
of Enzastaurin with SBE13. We observed a reduction
of GSK3β phosphorylation in both cell lines (Figure 1).
Treatment of HeLa cells with Enzastaurin reduced the
phosphorylation of GSK3β 48 and 72 hours after treatment
(Figure 1A and data not shown). The combinatorial
treatment of HeLa cells with Enzastaurin and SBE13
had no additional effect on the inhibition of the GSK3β
phosphorylation 48 and 72 hours after treatment (Figure
1B and data not shown) compared to the treatment
with Enzastaurin alone. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with
Enzastaurin for 24, 48 and 72 hours resulted also in a
reduced phosphorylation of GSK3β in a time and dosedependent manner (Figure 1C and data not shown). As
observed in HeLa cells the combinatorial treatment with
the two inhibitors Enzastaurin and SBE13 did not improve
the reduced GSK3β phosphorylation (Figure 1D and data
not shown).
To confirm that the reduced levels of phosphoGSK3β in the Western blot analyses were due to reduced
phosphorylation and not based on reduced total GSK3β
protein, we determined the levels of GSK3β protein in
both cell lines after treatment with Enzastaurin. The
expression of non-phosphorylated GSK3β was not
influenced by the treatment with Enzastaurin 48 and 72

hours after treatment (data not shown).

Effects of Enzastaurin alone and in combination
with SBE13 on Plk1 expression in HeLa and
MCF-7 cells

We did FACScan analyses to determine the cell
cycle distribution of HeLa, MCF-7, hTERT-RPE1, and
HCT116p53wt and HCT116p53-/- cells to examine whether the
changes in Plk1 expression were associated with an arrest
in particular stages of the cell cycle and to analyze the
influence of PKCβ inhibition on cell cycle distribution. In
addition, we wanted to figure out whether the absence or
presence of functional p53 influences the cell cycle arrest.
First, we analyzed HeLa and MCF-7 cells and
observed crucial differences in their cell cycle distribution
72 hours after treatment with the two inhibitors (Figure
3A-D). We observed a G2/M arrest in HeLa cells: after 72
hours 14% of the cells treated with 5 µM Enzastaurin were
in G2/M-Phase and treatment with 10 µM Enzastaurin
increases the number of cells in G2/M phase up to 30%
compared to 8% of control cells in the G2/M phase (Figure
3A). In addition to the observed G2/M arrest, treatment
with 5 µM Enzastaurin also enhances the amount of cells
in S phase up to 43% (control cells: 31%). Cells treated
with the combination of Enzastaurin and SBE13 (Figure
3B) displayed a stronger arrest in S phase compared to
cells treated with Enzastaurin alone up to 60% with 5 µM
Enza + 1 µM SBE13 and up to 66% with 10 µM Enza + 1
µM SBE13. The combination of 10 µM Enzastaurin with
1 µM SBE13 enhances the number of cells in G2/M phase
compared to control cells, but reduces the number of cells

We did western blot analyses to determine the
Plk1 expression in both cell lines after treatment with
Enzastaurin and SBE13 (Figure 2).
In HeLa cells we observed an increase in Plk1
protein levels up to 151% with 10 µM Enzastaurin
compared to untreated control cells after 48 hours (Figure
2A). The combinatorial treatment did not influence the
Plk1 protein levels (Figure 2B) 48 hours after treatment
compared to untreated control cells and did not elevate
Plk1 protein compared to single Enzastaurin treatment.
In MCF-7 cells in contrast there was a strong
decrease in Plk1 protein levels detectable (Figure 2C, D).
Cells treated with increasing concentrations of Enzastaurin
showed reduced Plk1 expression levels down to 70% with
10 µM Enzastaurin compared to the control cells (Figure
2C). The combinatorial treatment with Enzastaurin and
SBE13 reduces Plk1 protein levels compared to cells
treated with Enzastaurin alone very strongly to 21% with
10 µM Enzastaurin in combination with 1 µM SBE13,
which corresponds to the observed G0/G1 arrest (see
below, Figure 2D).

in G2/M phase compared with the treatment with 10 µM
Enzastaurin alone (control cells 7% in G2/M, 10 µM Enza
+ 1 µM SBE13 21% cells in G2/M).
In MCF-7 cells we did not observe a G2/M arrest
after treatment with Enzastaurin and SBE13 in all analyzed
concentrations and combinations, instead we could detect
a G0/G1 enrichment 72 hours after treatment with 10
µM Enzastaurin alone and in combination with SBE13
(Figures 3C, D). Treatment with 10 µM Enzastaurin led
to an increase of cells in G0/G1 phase up to 66% (control
cells: 47% G0/G1) (Figure 3C). The combination of 10
µM Enzastaurin with 1 µM SBE13 enhances the amount
of cells in G0/G1 phase up to 61% (control cells. 51%)
(Figure 3D). This G0/G1 arrest was accompanied by a
dose-dependent decrease of cells in the G2/M phase, the
treatment with 10 µM Enzastaurin in combination with 1
µM SBE13 leads to the strongest decrease of cells down
to 5% in the G2/M phase compared to 23% control cells
in the G2/M phase and an increase of cells in S phase
(control cells: 25%, 10 µM Enzastaurin together with 1
µM SBE13: 34%).
Next we analyzed the immortalized, but not
transformed hTERT-RPE1 cells, to compare effects
in cancer cells with non-cancer cells. The cell cycle
distribution of hTERT-RPE1 cells was not altered after the
treatment with 1 µM SBE13, increasing concentrations of
Enzastaurin or the combination of both inhibitors (Figures
3E and 3F).
To further investigate the dependence of cell
cycle arrest on the p53 status of the cells, we did cell
cycle analyses in HCT116p53wt and HCT116p53-/- cells

after treatment with the inhibitors as single agents or in
combination, respectively. These cells nicely confirmed the
initial observation in MCF-7 vs. HeLa cells, showing an
increasing amount of cells in G0/G1 phase in HCT116p53wt
cells (Figures 3 G, H), and an increasing amount of cells
in S and G2/M phase in HCT116p53-/- cells (Figures 3 I, J).

Analysis of apoptosis induction in HeLa and
MCF-7 cells after treatment with Enzastaurin and
SBE13
We did caspase 3/7 assays, because a G2/M arrest
is often followed by apoptosis [43] and PKCβ is also
involved in apoptotic pathways [44].To analyze whether
the combination of Enzastaurin and SBE13 enhances the
induction of apoptosis, we did caspase 3/7 assays (Figure
4). The combination of the two inhibitors enhances
the induction of apoptosis in HeLa cells compared to
Enzastaurin alone (5 µM Enzastaurin: 227%, 10 µM
Enzastaurin: 260%, 5 µM Enzastaurin + 1 µM SBE13:
693%, 10 µM Enzastaurin + 1 µM SBE13: 342%).In
MCF-7 cells the increase in apoptosis induction was much
weaker than in HeLa cells. However the combination
of Enzastaurin with SBE13 led to a slightly elevated
activity of caspases 3/7 compared to the treatment with
Enzastaurin alone (10 µM Enzastaurin: 116%, 10 µM
Enzastaurin + 1 µM SBE13: 138%)

10 µM Enzastaurin + 1 µM SBE13 (p=0.025, CI=0.83,
Figure 5B).MCF-7 cells displayed a moderate reduction
of proliferation compared to the reduction in HeLa cells.
MCF-7 cells showed a reduction in cell proliferation to
77% with 5 µM Enzastaurin and to 32% with 10 µM
Enzastaurin (p=0.033) (Figure 5C). The combination with
SBE13 showed no additional effect on cell proliferation
(Figure 5D).
To determine, whether this effect was cancer cellspecific we analyzed the immortalized, but not transformed
hTERT-RPE1 cells. The cell proliferation of hTERT-RPE1
cells was not decreased after the treatment with SBE13,
Enzastaurin or the combination of both inhibitors (Figures
5E and 5F).

To investigate whether the cell cycle arrest
and induction of apoptosis causes a reduction of cell
proliferation, we analyzed the cell proliferation of the
various cell lines after treatment with Enzastaurin alone
and in combination with SBE13 (Figure 5).HeLa cells
showed a significant reduced cell proliferation to levels of
53% with 5 µM Enzastaurin (p=0.047) and 14% with 10
µM Enzastaurin (p=0.0036) (Figure 5A). In combination
with SBE13 we observed a synergistic reduction to 39%
with 5 µM Enzastaurin + 1 µM SBE13 and to 17% with

To investigate whether the observed effects are
due to the p53 status of the cells, we also examined
HCT116p53wt and HCT116p53-/- (Figure 6). Enzastaurin
alone reduces the cell proliferation of HCT116p53wt cells
with an EC50 of 7.2 µM, the combination with SBE13
lowers this EC50 to 4 µM (Figures 6A and 6B). This
enhanced reduction of cell proliferation was synergistic
(CI=0.82). The EC50 value of Enzastaurin in HCT116p53-/-

cells was comparable (7.4 µM), the combination reduces
the EC50 value much stronger than in the HCT116p53wt cells
(0.6 µM, CI=0.21, Figures 6C and 6D).
These results confirm the hypothesis that the
enhanced reduction in cell proliferation after treatment
with SBE13 and Enzastaurin is due to missing p53
function of the cells, because in contrast to the former
comparison of HeLa and MCF-7 cells the HCT116 cells

only differ in their p53 status.

with SBE13. This could be an indirect consequence of
the observed G2/M arrest, because the Plk1 expression
peaks at G2/M phase, or a direct effect on the cell cycle
regulation. In MCF-7 cells we could not observe an
increase in Plk1 protein levels, instead the Plk1 protein
level decreases. Thus, the observed changes of Plk1
protein levels after treatment with Enzastaurin and SBE13
alone and in combination are in concordance with our
FACScan analyses: MCF-7 cells do not arrest in G2/M
phase, but in G0/G1 phase.
So the different Plk1 expression levels directly
reflect the different cell cycle arrest of HeLa vs. MCF-7
cells giving a first hint that this might be p53-dependent.
This observation is in concordance with earlier studies
from other groups correlating the reaction of cancer and
primary cells after treatment with microtubule poisons to
their p53 status, where p53 wild-type cells were resistant
to the chemotherapy, but p53-deficient cells were sensitive
to the treatment [45-49]. In our study, the p53-deficient
HeLa and HCT116p53-/- cells for example showed a G2/M
arrest after Enzastaurin treatment alone and an additional
increase of cells in S-Phase after combination with SBE13.
A possible explanation could be that the p53-deficient cells
are not able to repair their DNA damage induced by the
Plk1 inhibition at the G1/S checkpoint because of their
loss of intact p53 function, so they are forced to begin

DISCUSSION
In the current study we analyzed for the first time
the effects of PKCβ inhibition using Enzastaurin in
combination with Plk1 inhibition using SBE13 on cell
cycle regulation and induction of apoptosis in different
cancer cell lines and in immortalized, but not transformed
hTERT-RPE1 cells.
For the first studies, we used HeLa and MCF-7
cells because they have different p53 status and showed
also differences in their PKCβ expression. In all analyses,
MCF-7 cells were less sensitive than HeLa cells to the
inhibitor treatments, suggesting the importance of an
intact p53 function. To analyze the influence of the two
inhibitors on cell cycle regulators, we did western blot
analyses. Treatment with Enzastaurin or SBE13 did not
influence the PKCβ or GSK3β expression in HeLa cells.
The phosphorylation of GSK3β on S9 by PKCβ could be
inhibited by treatment with Enzastaurin both in HeLa and
MCF-7. This is in concordance with the literature, because
Enzastaurin inhibits the PKCβ activity and thereby the
phosphorylation of GSK3β on S9 [5].
The Plk1 protein level in HeLa cells was elevated
after treatment with Enzastaurin alone and in combination

mitosis with unrepaired DNA damage, resulting in an
elevated number of cells in S and in G2/M phase. Cells
with intact p53 function (MCF-7 and HCT116p53wt) showed
an increased number of cells in G0/G1 phase, obviously
arresting at the G1/S transition. These observations are
in concordance with other studies, linking the reaction of
cells after DNA damage to their p53 status [50]. The first
study which showed how the p53 status affects the effects
of Plk1 inhibition revealed that normal non-transformed
MCF10A and hTERT-RPE1 cells tolerate depletion of Plk1
pretty well compared to different cancer cell lines, and that
co-depletion of p53 in MCF10A cells rendered them to be
extremely sensitive to Plk1 inhibition [51]. Later, it was
analyzed by the same group how Plk1 regulates p53. The
regulation of p53 by Plk1 was further established by the
identification of two p53 regulators, Topors and GTSE1,
as direct Plk1 substrates [52]. Plk1 phosphorylates
Topors promoting its E3 ubiquitination activity towards
p53, but inhibits its sumoylation activity towards p53,
thus contributing to p53 degradation. Moreover, Plk1
phosphorylates GTSE1 which then translocates p53 from
the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This leads to the exposure
of p53 to the proteasome degradation machinery [53].
Another approach could correlate epigenetic modulations
of the Plk family under oxidative stress to the p53 status
of cancer cells, indicating the importance of analyzing p53
before potential Plk1-specific therapies [54].
In addition to the cancer cells, we analyzed the
immortalized, but not transformed hTERT-RPE1 cells
to investigate, whether we observe a cancer cell-specific
effect and to analyze another p53 wild-type cell line.
The cell cycle distribution of hTERT-RPE1 cells was not
influenced by the treatment with 1 µM SBE13, increasing
concentrations of Enzastaurin or the combination of both
inhibitors. This is in concordance with our own studies,
because it is already known that 1 µM SBE13 does not
alter the cell cycle distribution of hTERT-RPE1 cells [41].
Enzastaurin is also a highly selective inhibitor, which
does not impair the cell proliferation of non-transformed
colonic epithelial cells [42].
The different types of cell cycle arrest could be
observed in other studies dealing with NEDD inhibitors
[55]. They observed that HCT116p53wt cells with functional
p53 arrested at the G1/S transition after NEDD inhibition
and the HCT116p53-/- cells without a functional p53dependent G1/S checkpoint arrested later in mitosis due
to the formation of monopolar spindles. Using BI2536
[56,57] the authors observed comparable results as with
NEDD inhibition.
Because a G2/M arrest is often followed by
apoptosis [43], we analyzed whether the G2/M arrest in
HeLa cells induced by the combinatorial treatment with
Enzastaurin and SBE13 is also followed by apoptosis
and how the p53-proficient MCF-7 cells acted, because
they showed no enrichment of cells in the G2/M phase.
As expected, HeLa cells showed strong induction of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

apoptosis, but MCF-7 cells with their functional G1/S
checkpoint did not undergo apoptosis, because they are
able to repair the DNA damage induced by Plk1 inhibition
and complete mitosis normally. These observations again
are in concordance with Tillement et al. [55]. In both cell
lines we observed an elevated induction of apoptosis
with the combination of the two inhibitors compared to
Enzastaurin treatment alone. Earlier studies could show
that Plk1 inhibition by siRNAs or ASOs elevates drug
sensitivity of cancer cells [35,58]. Thus we could confirm
the chemo-sensitizing effect of Plk1 inhibition using
SBE13, which sensitizes the cells to the Enzastaurin
treatment.
Enzastaurin and SBE13 are known to reduce
cell proliferation in different cancer cell lines. Thus, to
investigate whether the observed cell cycle arrest and
the induction of apoptosis caused a reduction of cell
proliferation we analyzed the effect of the combinatorial
treatment with Enzastaurin and SBE13 on cell
proliferation of HeLa, MCF-7 and hTERT-RPE1 cells and
HCT116p53wt and HCT116p53-/- cells. In HeLa cells SBE13
was able to enhance the effect of Enzastaurin in reducing
cell proliferation synergistically. In our earlier studies,
we could already show that inhibition of Plk1 sensitizes
cancer cells to anti-neoplastic drugs [35,58]. Now we
were able to show this sensitizing effect using a small
molecule inhibitor, SBE13, together with Enzastaurin. In
MCF-7 cells in contrast, there was no additional effect of
SBE13 treatment on cell proliferation reduction compared
to Enzastaurin alone. In addition, the reduction of cell
proliferation was much less pronounced than in HeLa
cells, which could be due to their functional p53 whereas
HeLa cells are forced to go further in the cell cycle and
to start mitosis with damaged DNA and arrest in G2/M
phase followed by apoptosis. As observed in the cell cycle
analyses hTERT-RPE1 cells are not influenced by the
treatment of SBE13 together with Enzastaurin, the cell
proliferation remains unchanged. The finding, that the
combination of a Plk1 and a PKCβ inhibition reduces the
cell proliferation of cancer but not of primary cells could
be of great importance for the development of future anticancer therapy strategies.
We also did experiments using HCT116p53wt and
HCT116p53-/- cells to ensure that the differences observed
after treatment of HeLa and MCF-7 cells with the
combination of Enzastaurin and SBE13 are due to the
different p53 status of the cells. The HCT116p53-/- cells
showed a stronger reduction of the cell proliferation after
the treatment with the two inhibitors than the HCT116p53wt
cells.
Apparently, a functional p53 protects cells from the
cytotoxic effects caused by the combinatorial treatment
with Enzastaurin and SBE13. Thus, this combination
can be very useful to treat p53-deficient cancers, while
it displays no toxicity to normal cells due to their
functional p53. A very interesting approach regarding the

Treatment and analysis of cancer cells

susceptibility of cancers to chemotherapeutics dependent
on their p53 status has been developed in earlier studies
by Blagosklonny et al. They describe the possibility to
pretreat cells with DNA-damaging agents before adding
microtubule drugs leading to selective killing of cells
with defective p53/p21-dependent checkpoint [45,46]. In
general, the induction of wild-type p53 protects normal
cells in culture from cytotoxicity caused by conventional
cancer therapeutics, especially together with S- or M-phase
poisons. This so called p53-dependent cyclotherapy using
p53 activators stops proliferation of normal cells / healthy
tissues via cell cycle arrest, while leaving the p53-deficient
tumor susceptible to the conventional chemotherapy
(DNA-damaging agents, microtubule poisons) [47-49].
Taken together, our experiments nicely confirmed
our hypothesis that the p53 status of cancer cells could
serve as a predictive marker, which can be used to select
patients who will profit from a combinatorial Plk1 and
PKCβ inhibition therapy, especially to treat the p53deficient cancers.

Cells were treated with SBE13 and Enzastaurin
alone or in combination one day after subculturing.
Cells were seeded onto 6-well-plates, or 75-cm2- flasks,
respectively. Control cells were incubated with normal
culture medium without antibiotics. Concentrations
of SBE13 ranged from 1 µM–10 µM, Enzastaurin
concentrations ranged from 0.1 µM–10 µM. The growth
rate of 1x105 cells per 6-well was determined by counting
cells at 24 to 72 hours after treatment. Cell culture studies
were performed in triplicate for each time point. Cells
were harvested 0-72 hours after treatment for further
analyses.

Western blot analysis
Total protein (50 µg) was separated on 10% BisTris-polyacrylamide gels and transferred (at 30 V for 1
hr) to ImmobilonTM-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford,
MA) according to the Invitrogen protocol (Karlsruhe,
Germany). Membranes were incubated for 1 hr in 5%
powdered nonfat milk in PBS with antibodies against
PKCβ (1:200 - 1:1,000), GSK3β (1:2,500), p-GSK3β
(1:1000), Plk1 (1:200), or β-actin (1:100,000) and for 30
min in 5% nonfat dry milk with goat anti-mouse or goat
anti-rabbit serum (1:2,000) and visualized as described
[38].
All protein expression levels were presented as
described [38], scanned and quantified with the freeware
ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, USA).

METHODS
Kinase inhibitors and antibodies
The Plk1 kinase inhibitor SBE13 was purchased
from the SPECS compound catalogue (Delft, Netherlands),
PKCβ kinase inhibitor Enzastaurin (LY317615.HCl) was
purchased from Selleck (Absource Diagnostics GmbH
München, Germany).
Monoclonal-anti-PKCβ, anti-GSK3β, monoclonal
anti-Plk1 antibodies, goat anti-mouse and goat antirabbit secondary antibodies were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc., (Heidelberg, Germany), antiphospho-GSK3β antibody was from Cell Signaling
(Frankfurt/Main, Germany) and monoclonal β-actinantibody from Sigma-Aldrich (Taufkirchen, Germany).

FACS analysis
Cell cycle distribution was analyzed using a
FACScalibur apparatus (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg,
Germany). Quantification was carried out using ModFit
LT 3.2 for MAC (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME).
For FACS analysis, cells were harvested at the indicated
time points, washed with PBS, fixed and stained as
described [58]. For each experiment, 30,000 cells were
analyzed in triplicate.

Cell culture
The cancer cell lines HeLa and MCF-7 were from
DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany), hTERT-RPE1 cells
were from Clontech (Saint-Germain-en Laye, France). All
cells were cultured according to the supplier’s instructions
without antibiotics. Fetal calf serum (FCS) was from PAA
Laboratories (Cölbe, Germany), DMEM, RPMI 1640,
phosphate buffered saline (PBS), glutamine, and trypsin
were from Invitrogen (Karlsruhe, Germany). HCT116p53+/+
and HCT116p53 cells were cultured as instructed.

Caspase Assay
We did Caspase-Glo® assays to detect activation of
Caspase 3/7 using the Caspase-Glo® 3/7 Assay System
(Promega, Mannheim, Germany). In brief, cells were
analyzed 24-72 hrs after treatment with Enzastaurin and
SBE13. 10 µg total protein were mixed with the CaspaseGlo® substrate, incubated for 30 min and analyzed using
a Victor™ 1420 multilabel counter (Perkin Elmer Wallac,
Freiburg, Germany). The emitted light is measured at 562
nm referred to as RLU (relative luminescence units).

All experiments were performed at least in triplicate.
All treatments were compared with untreated control cells.
Statistical analysis was performed with student´s t-test to
consider random effects as described [38]. EC50 values
were calculated from the cell proliferation experiments
assuming the cell number of control cells at the latest time
point as 100%.
The combination index was calculated using the
following equation: c.i. = (Am)50/(As)50 + (Bm)50/(Bs)50,
where (Am)50 is the concentration of drug A necessary to
achieve a 50% inhibitory effect (IC50) in the combination,
(As)50 is the concentration of the same drug that will
produce the identical level of effect alone, (Bm)50 is the
IC50 of drug B in the combination and (Bs)50 is the IC50
of drug B after single administration. Antagonism is
indicated when c.i.>1, c.i.=1 indicates an additive effect
and a c.i.<1 indicates synergy [59].
