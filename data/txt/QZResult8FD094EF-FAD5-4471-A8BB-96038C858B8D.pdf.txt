ABSTRACT
Little is known about biological significance of ELK1, a transcriptional factor that
activates downstream targets including c-fos proto-oncogene, in bladder cancer. Recent
preclinical evidence also suggests the involvement of androgen receptor (AR) signaling
in bladder cancer progression. In this study, we aim to investigate the functions of ELK1
in bladder cancer growth and their regulation by AR signals. Immunohistochemistry in
bladder tumor specimens showed that the levels of phospho-ELK1 (p-ELK1) expression
were significantly elevated in urothelial neoplasms, compared with non-neoplastic
urothelium tissues, and were also correlated with AR positivity. Patients with p-ELK1positive non-muscle-invasive and muscle-invasive tumors had significantly higher risks for
tumor recurrence and progression, respectively. In AR-positive bladder cancer cell lines,
dihydrotestosterone treatment increased ELK1 expression (mRNA, protein) and its nuclear
translocation, ELK1 transcriptional activity, and c-fos expression, which was restored
by an anti-androgen hydroxyflutamide. ELK1 silencing via short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
resulted in decreases in cell viability/colony formation, and cell migration/invasion as
well as an increase in apoptosis. Importantly, ELK1 appears to require activated AR to
regulate bladder cancer cell proliferation, but not cell migration. Androgen also failed to
significantly induce AR transactivation in ELK1-knockdown cells. In accordance with our
in vitro findings, ELK1-shRNA expression considerably retarded tumor formation as well
as its growth in xenograft-bearing male mice. Our results suggest that ELK1 plays an
important role in bladder tumorigenesis and cancer progression, which is further induced
by AR activation. Accordingly, ELK1 inhibition, together with AR inactivation, has the
potential of being a therapeutic approach for bladder cancer.

we and others have demonstrated the data indicating the
promotion of bladder cancer growth by androgen-mediated
androgen receptor (AR) activation [2–11]. Androgens have
also been shown to modulate the expression or activity of
some molecules related to cell proliferation and/or tumor

growth, such as β-catenin, CD24, epidermal growth factor
receptor, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK),
via the AR pathway. These available data thus support that
targeting androgens or AR provides effective therapeutic
approaches for advanced bladder cancer. However, the
underlying mechanisms of how AR signals regulate bladder
cancer growth remain far from fully understood.
As a transcription factor, ETS domain-containing
protein ELK1 regulates the expression of a variety of
genes, including a proto-oncogene c-fos [12]. ELK1 is
phosphorylated through activation of the MAPK/ERK
pathways and translocates to the nucleus, resulting in
activation of downstream targets [13, 14]. Of note is
that ELK1 regulates the activity of genes associated
with the actin cytoskeleton [15]. ELK1 has also been
shown to regulate the expression of molecules engaged
in the proteolysis of extracellular matrix, such as
matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 [16].
Consequently, ELK1 is able to control cell migration
and invasion [15–17]. The involvement of ELK1 signals
in cancer development, possibly via the regulation of
inflammatory responses, has also been documented [18].
Recently, in prostate cancer cells where the role of
AR signals had been extensively studied, AR was found to
function as a coactivator of ELK1 [19]. Indeed, significant
growth retardation was seen in androgen-sensitive, ARpositive prostate cancer LNCaP cells expressing ELK1short hairpin RNA (shRNA), compared with control cells,
cultured in the presence of androgen [19]. In the current
study, we investigated whether androgen could activate
ELK1, as a downstream target of AR, in bladder cancer cells
as well as whether ELK1 could affect their proliferation and
migration in the presence and absence of androgen.

increased the expression of two of the transcription factors,
ELK1 (3.7-fold) and ROR (2.9-fold), in control cells,
while others were marginally up-regulated (1.6–2.5-fold,
P > 0.05). In AR knockdown cells, DHT still significantly
induced ROR expression (3.3-fold), whereas it only
marginally increased ELK1 expression (1.2-fold). These
results suggested that androgens could up-regulate ELK1
expression through the AR pathway in bladder cancer cells.
We therefore decided to further study ELK1 as a potential
target of androgen/AR signals in bladder cancer.

Expression of ELK1 in human bladder cancer
We investigated the expression of ELK1 in human
urothelial carcinoma cell lines, UMUC3, TCCSUP,
647V, and 5637, as well as an immortalized human
normal urothelial cell line, SVHUC, by western blotting
(Figure 2A). ELK1 expression was found to be the strongest
in UMUC3 and the weakest in SVHUC. No significant
difference in ELK1 expression between UMUC3control-shRNA and UMUC3-AR-shRNA or between
647V-AR and 647V-control was seen (data not shown).
We also stained immunohistochemically for ELK1 and
phospho-ELK1 (p-ELK1) in 129 bladder urothelial neoplasm
specimens and corresponding 86 non-neoplastic bladder
tissues. Positive signals of ELK1 and p-ELK1 were detected
predominantly in the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively, of
benign/malignant urothelial cells (Figure 2B). Overall, ELK1/
p-ELK1 was positive in 100% (24.8% 2+, 75.2% 3+)/65.9%
(35.7% 1+, 14.7% 2+, 15.5% 3+) of tumors, which was
significantly higher than in benign urothelial tissues [100%
(8.1% 1+, 37.2% 2+, 54.7% 3+)/34.9% (20.9% 1+, 11.6% 2+,
2.3% 3+)] (Table 1). In tumors, the expression levels of ELK1
versus p-ELK1 were correlated (r2 = 0.465, P < 0.001). In
addition, correlations between expression of ELK1 versus AR
(r2 = 0.303, P < 0.001) as well as that of p-ELK1 versus
AR (r2 = 0.223, P = 0.011) were significant. Kaplan-Meier
and log-rank tests revealed that patients with p-ELK1positive non-muscle-invasive (Figure 2C) and muscleinvasive (Figure 2D) tumors had significantly higher risks
for tumor recurrence (P = 0.043) and disease progression
(P = 0.045)/cancer-specific mortality (P = 0.008), respec­
tively. In contrast, no significant associations between
ELK1 levels in tumors and patient outcomes were found
(data not shown). To determine whether p-ELK1 expression
was an independent prognosticator, multivariate analysis
was performed with Cox model (Table 2). In non-muscleinvasive tumors, p-ELK1 positivity and tumor recurrence
showed a trend toward significance [hazard ratio (HR) =
2.829, P = 0.056]. In muscle-invasive tumors, p-ELK1
positivity strongly correlated with cancer-specific survival
(HR = 2.693, P = 0.021), whereas positivity of AR (HR =
2.280, P = 0.042), but not that of p-ELK1, was identified as a
strong predictor for disease progression. These findings in our
immunohistochemistry (IHC) suggest that ELK1 activation
may involve bladder tumorigenesis and cancer progression.

RESULTS
Transcription factors up-regulated by androgen
in bladder cancer cells
We aimed to identify downstream targets of androgenmediated AR signaling in bladder cancer cells. Using a
profiling array kit, activities of 96 known transcription factors
were compared in AR-positive bladder cancer UMUC3 cells
with versus without a non-aromatizable synthetic androgen
methyltrienolone (R1881) treatment. Of the 96 transcription
factors, six were found to be induced (i.e. greater than 3.0fold increase) by the androgen. These included nuclear factor
of activated T-cells (NFAT; 6.3-fold), NKX2–5 (4.3-fold),
ELK1 (4.1-fold), RAR-related orphan receptor (ROR; 3.5fold), GLI1 (3.3-fold), and MyoD (3.2-fold). Additionally, in
this assay, R1881 up-regulated AR by 1.7-fold.
Changes in the expression levels of these six genes
up-regulated in the profiling assay were next examined in
UMUC3-control-shRNA (Figure 1A) and UMUC3-ARshRNA (Figure 1B) treated with 1 nM dihydrotestosterone
(DHT) for 24 hours. Androgen treatment significantly

of ELK1 was then examined in UMUC3 and 647V-AR
by western blotting: treatment with DHT resulted in
increases in nuclear ELK1 expression as well as decreases
in cytoplasmic ELK1 expression, and HF antagonized
the effects of DHT (Figure 3C). Promotion of nuclear
translocation of ELK1 by androgen was further confirmed

transcriptional activity was also determined in the cell
extracts with transfection of an ELK1 luciferase reporter

DHT considerably augmented ELK1 luciferase activity,
compared with mock treatment, and HF restored the
enhancement (Figure 3E). To confirm the up-regulation of
ELK1 activity by androgen, we measured the expression

levels of c-fos, a downstream target of ELK1 signals [12].
Significant increases in c-fos gene expression by DHT
were also seen in UMUC3-control-shRNA and 647V-AR,
but not in UMUC3-AR-shRNA and 647V-control, which
was inhibited by the addition of HF (Figure 3F). These
results indicate that androgen-mediated AR signals upregulate the expression and activity of ELK1 in bladder
cancer cells.

ELK1-shRNA-expressing lines versus control-shRNAexpressing lines. In both assays, ELK1 knockdown was
found to significantly induce apoptosis. However, it only
marginally changed the cell cycle (e.g. G0/G1 population)
(data not shown).

Role of ELK1 in bladder cancer cell proliferation

Cell migration and invasion are critical steps during
tumor progression and metastasis. To see if ELK1 is
involved in bladder cancer cell migration and invasion, we
performed a scratch wound healing assay and a transwell
invasion assay, respectively, in UMUC3 and 647V-AR
expressing either ELK1-shRNA or control-shRNA. In the
wound healing assay, silencing of ELK1, compared with
control cells, significantly delayed wound closure 24 hours
after wound generation (Figure 6A). Similarly, in the
transwell assay, knockdown of ELK1 demonstrated marked
decreases in cell invasion ability, compared with control
lines (Figure 6B). Less significant reduction in 647V-AR
cell migration/invasion, as well as cell proliferation, by the
ELK1-shRNA might be due to its transient transfection
(vs. stable expression in UMUC3 cells).
Using a quantitative RT-PCR method, we
then assessed the effects of ELK1 silencing on the
expression of MMPs that are known to play a critical
role in cancer cell migration/invasion, angiogenesis,
and resultant tumor progression and metastasis. ELK1shRNA reduced the levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9
expression, compared with control-shRNA, in two cell
lines (Figure 6C). We also determined the enzymatic
activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by gelatin zymography
that showed considerable decreases in their activity in
UMUC3-ELK1-shRNA cells, compared with UMUC3control-shRNA cells (Figure 6D).

Role of ELK1 on bladder cancer cell migration
and invasion

To further study the functional role of ELK1 in the
growth of bladder cancer, an ELK1-shRNA was stably
and transiently expressed in UMUC3 and 647V-AR cells,
respectively. As expected, the levels of ELK1 mRNA
(Figure 4A) and protein (Figure 4B) were substantially
lower in ELK1-shRNA-expressing lines than in respective
scrambled control-shRNA-expressing lines. ELK1
transcriptional activity was also diminished in UMUC3ELK1-shRNA, compared with UMUC3-control-shRNA
(Figure 4C).
To determine whether ELK1 down-regulation exerts
an influence on the proliferation of bladder cancer cells,
we compared cell viability [by methyl thiazolyl disphenyl
tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay] and colony formation
(by clonogenic assay) between ELK1-positive lines versus
their knockdown lines. In UMUC3 (34% decrease at
day 5) and 647V-AR (20% decrease at day 5) cells, the
expression of ELK1-shRNA strongly suppressed their
growth at days 2–5 (Figure 5A). Similarly, ELK1 silencing
resulted in significant decreases in the number and area of
colonies in these cells (Figure 5B).
To investigate how ELK1 regulates cell
proliferation, we performed terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
assay (Figure 5C) and flow cytometry (Figure 5D) in

with our previous observations [2, 20], 1  nM DHT

only marginally increased UMUC3-ELK1-shRNA cell

findings in LNCaP [19] or UMUC3 cultured with normal
fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Figure 5A), ELK1 silencing
in UMUC3 cells cultured with charcoal-stripped FBS
and 1 nM DHT significantly reduced their viability by
30% (lanes 2 vs. 4), whereas, in UMUC3 cells with

It has been demonstrated that ELK1-shRNA
expression in LNCaP prostate cancer cells does
not decrease, rather does increase modestly, their
proliferation in an androgen depleted condition and that
androgen does not significantly induce the proliferation
of LNCaP-ELK1-shRNA cells [19]. We therefore
investigated whether ELK1 could affect the viability
and migration of AR-positive bladder cancer cells in
the absence of androgens and whether androgen could

suggest that ELK1 silencing inhibits the development and
progression of bladder cancer.

Finally, we used mouse xenograft models to
investigate the role of ELK1 in bladder tumor outgrowth
in vivo. UMUC3-control-shRNA and UMUC3-ELK1shRNA cells were implanted subcutaneously into the
flanks of immunocompromised mice (Figure 8A),
and tumor development was monitored at the outset.
ELK1 knockdown strikingly delayed the formation of
xenograft tumors, compared with the control (Figure
8B). Following tumor formation (i.e. day 0 when the
estimated tumor volume reached 40 mm3), its size was
further monitored. As shown in Figure 8C, the inoculated
ELK1-shRNA tumors were smaller than control-shRNA
tumors, especially after day 5, although the differences in
tumor size between the two groups did not narrowly reach
statistical significance (P > 0.1 at days 1–8; P = 0.056 at

DISCUSSION
Androgen-induced AR activation has been
demonstrated to correlate with the promotion of bladder
cancer progression [2–9]. Nonetheless, classical androgenregulated genes, such as prostate-specific antigen and
NKX3-1, which are known to involve the outgrowth of
prostate cancer, do not significantly contribute to that of

of how androgens activate the AR pathway in bladder
cancer cells are to be further investigated. To identify

in bladder cancer cells, we first screened 96 known
transcription factors, using a profiling array kit. In UMUC3
cells with versus without R1881 treatment, the expression
of at least six transcription factors was found to be
significantly up-regulated. However, the stimulatory effect
of DHT was not significant in UMUC3-control-shRNA
cells (e.g. NFAT, NKX2–5, GLI1, MyoD) or remained
significant in UMUC3-AR-shRNA cells (e.g. ROR). We
thus narrowed down the candidate to ELK1 and further
investigated whether ELK1 could be activated by androgenmediated AR signaling in bladder cancer cells and thereby
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

affected tumor progression. Meanwhile, up-regulation of
ROR in AR knockdown cells may imply androgen action
via the non-AR pathway or the presence of the second AR
in bladder cancer cells, which requires further studies.
In accordance with the above findings, DHT
activated ELK1 in AR-positive bladder cancer cells.
However, some of our findings in bladder cancer were
inconsistent with those shown in prostate cancer [19].
For instance, androgens induced the expression of ELK1
and its downstream target c-fos in bladder cancer cells,
while they failed to alter their expression significantly

in prostate cancer cells. Instead, in prostate cancer cells,
AR was shown to function as a co-activator of ELK1 via
bypassing the classical mechanism of ELK1 activation by
phosphorylation. In AR-positive osteoblast cells, DHT
was shown to increase the phosphorylation of ELK1 [23].
Androgens could also activate a variety of target genes in
ELK1-dependent manners and enhanced ELK1 promoter
activity in prostate cancer cells [19]. We additionally
found in bladder cancer cells that androgens induced
nuclear translocation of ELK1 and its transactivation.
ELK1 is involved in a wide variety of functions,
including the regulation of cell proliferation, cell cycle
control, and apoptosis [24–26]. AR is also known
to induce MAPK signaling cascades, leading to cell
proliferation [27–29]. In prostate cancer, ELK1-shRNA
expression resulted in a significant decrease in the growth
of androgen-sensitive/AR-positive LNCaP cells cultured
with R1881, but not in that of LNCaP cultured without
androgens or that of AR-negative cells [19]. Consistent
with the findings in prostate cancer cells, we observed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

strong inhibition in the proliferation and colony formation
of AR-positive bladder cancer cells in the presence of
androgen (i.e. normal FBS, DHT treatment), but not in
the former of AR-positive cells in androgen-depleted
conditions or that of AR-negative cells, by ELK1
knockdown. Thus, AR activation is likely required for the
regulation of bladder cancer cell growth by ELK1. We
also demonstrated that androgens failed to significantly
increase the viability of bladder cancer cells expressing
ELK1-shRNA, suggesting ELK1-dependent effects of
androgens on cell proliferation. We additionally found
that ELK1 silencing induced apoptosis of bladder cancer
cells that possessed a functional AR and were cultured
with FBS containing androgens but did not modulate
the cell-cycle status. In contrast, in breast cancer MCF7 cells expressing an AR as well as estrogen receptors,
ELK1 overexpression reduced their colony formation [25].
Indeed, ELK1-shRNA modestly increased the cell growth
of AR-positive prostate cancer [19] as well as bladder
cancer (Figure 7A) in androgen-depleted conditions.

As aforementioned, ELK1 has been implicated in
cell migration and invasion via modulating the expression
of various genes/proteins important in them, including
MMP-2 and MMP-9. The role of ELK1 in promoting the
migration of mammary gland-derived cells [15, 17] as well
as gastric cancer cells [16] has indeed been confirmed. In
these studies [15–17], however, the status of AR expression
in the cell lines used and the effect of androgens on ELK1mediated cell migration were not investigated. Instead, in
cardiac fibroblast cells, estrogen was shown to modulate
MMP-2 promoter activity via phosphorylation of ELK1
[30]. In the current study, ELK1 silencing in AR-positive
bladder cancer lines cultured with androgen resulted in
significant decreases in cell migration and invasion as
well as the expression and enzymatic activity of MMP2/MMP-9. Importantly, the inhibitory effects of ELK1shRNA expression on cell migration were also seen in an
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

AR-positive line cultured in an androgen-depleted
condition as well as in an AR-negative line. Thus, in
contrast to its function in cell proliferation, ELK1 may
not require activated AR to regulate bladder cancer cell
migration. We observed similar findings in prostate cancer
lines: ELK1-shRNA strongly inhibited AR-negative
cell migration/invasion and MMP-2/MMP-9 expression
(unpublished data). Nonetheless, DHT more significantly
induced cell migration of UMUC3-control-shRNA,
compared with UMUC3-ELK1-shRNA, suggesting that
the effect of androgens could be mediated at least partially
through the ELK1 pathway.
Again, the interaction between AR and ELK1
signals has been studied in prostate cancer cells [19]. Our
data in bladder cancer cells indicate that androgen induces
the expression and activity of ELK1. Of note, activated
AR is necessary for ELK1 to promote bladder cancer cell
29871

proliferation, but not cell migration. Similarly, androgen
appears to require ELK1 to induce bladder cancer cell
proliferation, while it can still increase the migration
ability of ELK1-knockdown cells. In addition, androgen
does not significantly induce AR transcriptional activity
in the absence of ELK1, suggesting its necessity for AR
activation. Thus, ELK1 and AR signals appear to require
each other for their functions at least in bladder cancer cell
proliferation.
The expression of ETS-domain proteins has been
demonstrated in several types of malignancies, including
colon cancer, Ewing sarcoma, leukemias, breast cancer,
and cervical carcinoma [31]. Elevated expression of ELK1
or p-ELK1 has also been detected in tissue specimens
of breast cancer [32, 33], colonic adenocarcinoma [34],
and lung non-small cell carcinoma [35, 36]. Particularly
in breast cancer tissues, positive correlations between
p-ELK1 expression and AR [32] or estrogen receptor [33]
expression were noted. However, none of these studies
have assessed the prognostic value of ELK1 or p-ELK1
expression. On the other hand, the expression levels of
ELK1 [37] and p-ELK1 [38] have been determined in
bladder cancer cell lines. Our immunohistochemical
staining in bladder tissue microarrays (TMAs) showed
that, compared with non-neoplastic urothelium, significant
increases in the expression of ELK1 and p-ELK1 were
observed in bladder tumor. Furthermore, although
the levels of ELK1 and p-ELK1 expression were not
correlated with tumor grades or stages, p-ELK1 positivity
precisely predicted recurrence of non-muscle invasive
tumor in a univariate setting as well as a poor prognosis
of muscle-invasive tumor after radical cystectomy both
in univariate and multivariate settings. Thus, p-ELK1
may serve as a prognosticator especially in patients with
muscle-invasive bladder cancer. These results also suggest
that ELK1 activation promotes bladder cancer growth.
More interestingly, ELK1/p-ELK1 and AR expression in
bladder tumors was positively correlated.
In conclusion, ELK1 likely plays an important role
in bladder tumorigenesis and cancer progression. ELK1
is indeed activated in bladder cancer, which is further
induced by AR activation. It is thus possible that ELK1
and AR serve each other as transcriptional coactivators in
bladder cancer cells. Accordingly, not only AR or ELK1
signaling but also their interaction offers a therapeutic
target for bladder cancer.

core facility. SVHUC cells and other cell lines were
maintained in F-12K (Mediatech) and Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (Mediatech), respectively, all
supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 units/mL),
and streptomycin (100 units/mL) at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were cultured in phenol redfree medium supplemented with either 5% FBS or 5%
charcoal-stripped FBS (for androgen treatment) at least
24 hours before experimental treatment. We obtained
R1881 from PerkinElmer; and DHT and HF from Sigma.

Stable cell lines
A shRNA plasmid targeting human ELK1 (sc35290-SH; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a nonsilencing control shRNA plasmid (sc-108060; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) was transfected, using Lipofectamine®
2000 transfection reagent (Life Technologies). Selection
of stable clones was carried out with puromycin (Sigma)
treatment at a concentration of 6 μg/mL. UMUC3-ARshRNA and UMUC3-control-shRNA, using a retrovirus
vector pMSCV/U6, as well as 647V-AR expressing
a full-length wild-type human AR and its control line
(647V-vector), using a lentivirus vector (pWPI-AR or
pWPI-control) with psPAX2 envelope and pMD2.G
packaging plasmids, were established in our previous
studies [5, 39].

Transcription factor profiling assay
Nuclear extracts isolated from UMUC3 cells treated
with or without 1 nM R1881 for 24 hours were analyzed,
using an assay kit (TF Activation Profiling Plate Array II,
Signosis), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Chemiluminescence was measured by a multidetection
microplate reader.

Bladder TMA and IHC
We retrieved bladder tissue specimens obtained
by transurethral resection performed at the Johns
Hopkins Hospital. All the sections were reviewed for
confirmation of original diagnoses, according to the
2004 World Health Organization/International Society of
Urological Pathology classification system for urothelial
neoplasms. Appropriate approval from the institutional
review board was obtained before construction and use
of the TMA. Bladder TMAs, consisting of 129 cases of
urothelial neoplasm, were constructed from formalin fixed
paraffin embedded specimens, as described previously
[41, 42]. These patients included 98 men and 31 women
with a mean/median age of 65.7/69 years (range: 26–89).
The primary tumors included 11 papillary urothelial
neoplasms of low malignant potential (PUNLMPs),
40 non-invasive (pTa) low-grade urothelial carcinomas,
27 non-muscle-invasive (pTa or pT1) high-grade urothelial
carcinomas, and 51 muscle-invasive (≥pT2) high-grade

urothelial carcinomas. All 51 patients with muscle-invasive
tumor ultimately underwent cystectomy. None of the
patients had received therapy with radiation or anti-cancer
drugs prior to the collection of the tissues included in the
TMAs. All of these 129 cases were included in our prior
study analyzing 188 cases for the expression of AR [41].
IHC was performed on the sections (5 μm thick) from
the bladder TMAs, as described previously [5, 42]. Briefly,
after deparaffinization, hydration, and antigen retrieval,
samples were incubated overnight at 4°C with a primary
antibody to ELK1 (clone I-20; dilution 1:50; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) or p-ELK1 (clone B-4 phosphorylated at
serine 383; dilution 1:30; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then
with a broad spectrum secondary antibody (Invitrogen). All
stains were manually quantified by a single pathologist (H.M.)
blinded to sample identify. The German immunoreactive
scores calculated by multiplying the percentage of
immunoreactive cells (0% = 0; 1–10% = 1; 11–50% = 2; 51–
80% = 3; 81–100% = 4) by staining intensity (negative = 0;
weak = 1; moderate = 2; strong = 3) were considered negative
(0; 0–1), weakly positive (1+; 2–4), moderately positive
(2+; 6–8), and strongly positive (3+; 9–12).

binding was detected, using an anti-ELK1 antibody (clone
I-20; dilution 1:50), an anti-GAPDH antibody (clone 6C5;
dilution 1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or an antihistone H1 antibody (clone FL-219; dilution 1:1000; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), and a secondary antibody (mouse
IRDye 680LT or rabbit IRDye 800CW, LI-COR,), followed
by scanning with an infrared imaging system (Odyssey, LICOR).

Immunofluorescent staining
Cells plated onto 8-well chamber slides (NuncLabTek, Thermo Scientific) were cultured in medium
containing ethanol, DHT, and/or HF for 24 hours. At the
end of the drug treatment, the adherent cells were rinsed
and fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were then
blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 hour at
37°C, and a primary antibody (ELK1; clone I-20; dilution
1:50) was added and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C.
Fluorescence images were acquired with a fluorescence
microscopy (EVOS FL Auto, Life Technologies).

Reporter gene assay

RT and real-time PCR

Cells at a density of 50–70% confluence in 24-well
plates were co-transfected with 250 ng of pELK-Luc
reporter plasmid DNA (LR-2061, Signosis) and 2.5 ng of
pRL-TK plasmid DNA, using GeneJuice (Novagen). After
18 hours of transfection, the cells were cultured in the
presence or absence of DHT and/or HF for 24 hours. Cell
lysates were then assayed for luciferase activity determined
using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega) and
luminometer (FLUOstar Omega, BMG Labtech).

Total RNA (0.5 μg) isolated from cultured cells,
using TRIzol (Invitrogen), was reverse transcribed using
1 μM oligo (dT) primers and 4 units of Omniscript
reverse transcriptase (Qiagen) in a total volume of
20 μL. Real-time PCR was then performed, using SYBR
GreenER qPCR superMix (Bio-Rad) for iCycler (BioRad), as described previously [5, 8, 39]. The following
primer pairs were used for RT-PCR: ELK1 (forward,
5′-CAGCCAGAGGTGTCTGTTACC-3′; reverse, 5′-GAG
CGCATGTACTCGTTCC-3′), c-fos (forward 5′-CGAG
ATGGAGATCGGTATGGT-3′; reverse, 5′-GGGTCTTC
TTACCCGGCTTG-3′); MMP-2 (forward, 5′-TACAGGA
TCATTGGCTACACACC-3′; reverse, 5′-GGTCACATC
GCTCCAGACT-3′); and MMP-9 (forward, 5′-TGT
ACCGCTATGGTTACACTCG-3′; reverse, 5′-GGCA
GGGACAGTTGCTTCT-3′). GAPDH (forward, 5′-CTCCT
CCACCTTTGACGCTG-3′; reverse, 5′-CATACCAGG
AAATGAGCTTGACAA-3′) was used as an internal control.

Cell proliferation
We used MTT assay to assess cell viability, as
described previously [40]. Briefly, cells (0.5–1 × 103)
seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates were incubated for
up to 120 hours, and at the end of the culture 10 μL MTT
stock solution (5 mg/mL; Sigma) was added to each well
with 100 μL of medium for 4 hours at 37°C. The medium
was replaced with 100 μL dimethyl sulfoxide, followed
by incubation for 5 minutes at room temperature. The
absorbance was then measured at a wavelength of 570 nm
with background subtraction at 655 nm using luminometer
(FLUOstar Omega).

Western blotting
Protein extraction and western blotting were
performed, as described previously [40] with minor
modifications. We also used a nuclear and cytoplasmic
extraction reagent kit (NE-PER, Thermo Scientific) for
obtaining separate nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Equal
amounts of protein (30–50 μg) obtained from cell extracts
were separated in 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred
to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immun-Blot PVDF
Membrane, Bio-Rad) by electroblotting. Specific antibody

Colony formation
Cells (5 × 102) seeded in 12-well plates were
allowed to grow until colonies in the control well were
easily distinguishable. The cells were then fixed with
methanol and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The number
of colonies and their areas were quantitated using ImageJ
software (National Institutes of Health).

Apoptosis and cell cycle analysis

Mouse xenograft model

The TUNEL assay was performed on cellburdening coverslips, using the DeadEnd Fluorometric
TUNEL system (Promega), followed by counterstaining
for DNA with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).
Apoptotic index was determined in the cells visualized
by the fluorescence microscopy (EVOS FL Auto). For
cell cycle analysis, flow cytometry was performed
in cells (1 × 106/10-cm dish) cultured for 24 hours,
harvested with trypsin, fixed in 70% ethanol, and stained
with propidium iodide (PI) buffer (50 μg/mL) for 30
minutes. Cellular PI content was measured on a Guava
PCA-96 Base SystemTM flow cytometer (EMD Millipore)
equipped with a green laser at 532 nm wavelength. Data
were analyzed, using the Guava Cell Cycle software
(EMD Millipore).

Animal protocols in accordance with the National
Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of
Experimental Animals were approved at our institution.
Cells (5 × 105/100 μL/site) resuspended in Matrigel (BD
Biosciences) were subcutaneously injected into the flank
of 6-week-old male immunocompromised NOD-SCID
mice, as described previously [40, 43]. Serial caliper
measurements of perpendicular diameters were used to
calculate tumor volume by the following formula: (short
diameter)2 × (longest diameter) × 0.5.

Statistical analysis
The Fisher exact test or the χ2 test was used to
evaluate the associations between categorized variables.
The numerical data were compared by Student’s t-test.
Correlations between variables were determined by the
Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Survival rates in
patients were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and
comparison was made by log-rank test. These included
comparisons among patients with non-muscle-invasive
tumor or those with muscle-invasive tumor. Tumor
progression was defined as development of high-grade
or invasive carcinoma (initial PUNLMP or low-grade
carcinoma), muscle-invasive or metastatic tumor (initial
non-muscle-invasive high-grade carcinoma), or local
recurrence or metastatic tumor after radical cystectomy
(initial muscle-invasive tumor). In addition, the COX
proportional hazards model (stepwise regression) was
used to assess the prognostic indicators, including tumor
grade, pathologic pT stage, lymph node involvement
at cystectomy, lymphovascular invasion, concomitant
urothelial carcinoma in situ, AR expression, ELK1
expression, and p-ELK1 expression. P values less than
0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.

Cell migration
In order to evaluate the ability of cell migration, a
scratch wound healing assay was performed. Cells at a
density of 90–100% confluence in 12-well plates were
scratched manually with a sterile 200 μl plastic pipette tip,
cultured for 24 hours, fixed with methanol, and stained
with 0.1% crystal violet. The width of the wound area was
quantitated, using ImageJ.

Cell invasion
Cell invasiveness was determined, using a Matrigel
(60 μg; BD Biosciences)-coated transwell chamber (8.0
μm pore size polycarbonate filter with 6.5 mm diameter;
Corning), as described previously [40]. Briefly, cells
(5 × 104) in 100 μL of serum-free medium were added
to the upper chamber of the transwell, whereas 600 μL
of medium containing 5% FBS was added to the lower
chamber. After incubation for 16 hours at 37°C in a CO2
incubator, invaded cells were fixed, stained with 0.1%
crystal violet, and counted under a light microscope.

Gelatin zymography
The gelatinolytic activity of MMPs was determined
by SDS-PAGE gelatin zymography, as described
previously [43]. Briefly, the conditioned medium derived
from culture of cells at a density of 60–70% confluence
in 10-cm dish in a serum-free condition for 24 hours
was concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter
units (30 kDa, Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, followed by 10% SDS-PAGE in a gel
containing 0.1% gelatin (Sigma). After electrophoresis,
the gel was rinsed with a renaturing buffer (Bio-Rad) for
60 minutes, incubated overnight in a developing buffer
(Bio-Rad) at 37°C with shaking, and stained with 0.25%
Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad).
