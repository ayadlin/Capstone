Abstract
Previous studies indicate that oncogenic stress activates the ATR-Chk1 pathway. Here, we show that ATRChk1 pathway engagement is essential for limiting genomic instability following oncogenic Ras transformation.
ATR pathway inhibition in combination with oncogenic Ras expression synergistically increased genomic
instability, as quantified by chromatid breaks, sister chromatid exchanges, and H2AX phosphorylation. This level
of instability was significantly greater than that observed following ATR suppression in untransformed control
cells. In addition, consistent with a deficiency in long-term genome maintenance, hypomorphic ATR pathway
reduction to 16% of normal levels was synthetic lethal with oncogenic Ras expression in cultured cells. Notably,
elevated genomic instability and synthetic lethality following suppression of ATR were not due to accelerated
cycling rates in Ras-transformed cells, indicating that these synergistic effects were generated on a per-cell-cycle
basis. In contrast to the synthetic lethal effects of hypomorphic ATR suppression, subtle reduction of ATR
expression (haploinsufficiency) in combination with endogenous levels of K-rasG12D expression elevated the
incidence of lung adenocarcinoma, spindle cell sarcoma, and thymic lymphoma in p53 heterozygous mice.
K-rasG12D-induced tumorigenesis in ATRþ/p53þ/ mice was associated with intrachromosomal deletions
and loss of wild-type p53. These findings indicate that synergistic increases in genomic instability following ATR
reduction in oncogenic Ras-transformed cells can produce 2 distinct biological outcomes: synthetic lethality
upon significant suppression of ATR expression and tumor promotion in the context of ATR haploinsufficiency.
These results highlight the importance of the ATR pathway both as a barrier to malignant progression and as a
potential target for cancer treatment. Cancer Res; 70(23); 9693–702. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Hyperproliferative stimuli, oncogenic stress, and tumor
progression are associated with elevated genomic instability
and DNA damage checkpoint signaling (1–8). Checkpoint
signaling is regulated in large part by the ATR and ATM
protein kinases, which serve as initial responders to aberrant
replication fork progression and DNA double-strand breaks,
respectively (9, 10). Checkpoint activation in these contexts
has been proposed to function as a barrier to malignant
progression by both preventing proliferation and countering

the untoward effects of oncogenic stress on DNA metabolism
and integrity (2, 3, 8).
Activation of the ATR pathway by oncogenic stress has been
attributed to a variety of cellular changes, including premature
or redundant origin firing, changes in interorigin distance, and
increased oxidative DNA damage (4–12). In both yeast and
vertebrates, ATR signaling plays a critical role in maintaining
genome stability following irregularities in DNA replication
fork progression. Inhibition of polymerase processivity (e.g.,
reduced catalysis or encounters with damaged bases) and other
disruptions that uncouple DNA unwinding from nucleotide
incorporation activate ATR, which prevents replication
fork collapse into DNA double-strand breaks (9, 10, 13–22).
In accordance with this function, chromatid breaks at
common fragile sites and other difficult-to-replicate regions
of the genome are particularly increased when partial polymerase inhibition is combined with suppression of the ATRChk1 pathway (9, 17–19, 23). Notably, oncogenic stress alone
has also been shown to increase breakage at common fragile
sites (2, 3, 8), implying that suppression of the ATR-Chk1
pathway in this context may further elevate genomic instability
in a synergistic fashion.

Herein, we investigate the hypothesis that oncogenic transformation produces an increased reliance on the ATR-Chk1 pathway
to maintain genome stability. We show that ATR-Chk1 pathway
inhibition in combination with expression of oncogenic forms of
Ras elevates double-strand break formation and mitotic recombination on a per-cell-cycle basis. Importantly, oncogene-induced
dependence on the ATR pathway to maintain genome stability
leads to distinct effects following ATR suppression: either promoting oncogenic Ras-induced tumorigenesis when ATR is haploinsufficient or causing synthetic lethality when the ATR-Chk1
pathway is inhibited more substantially. These results show the
importance of the ATR-Chk1 pathway in maintaining genomic
stability under oncogenic stress and imply a key role for ATR
suppression in both cancer etiology and treatment.

Materials and Methods
Oncogenic Ras-transformed cell line generation
Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were immortalized via
lentiviral introduction of shRNAs targeting p16INK4A and
p19ARF (TRCN0000077813). Oncogenic Ras was expressed
either 1) by the treatment of K-rasG12D/þCre-ERT2þ MEFs
with 0.2 mmol/L of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT; Calbiochem)
for 48 hours (K-rasG12D endogenous levels) or 2) by infection of
NIH3T3 cells (clone 7) or immortalized MEFs with recombinant retrovirus expressing K-rasG12D or H-rasG12V. Control cell
lines were produced in parallel using retrovirus derived from
the corresponding empty vectors (pWZL-hygro or pBabepuro). Infected cells were selected in 2 mg/mL of puromycin
(pBABE-puro vectors) or 200 mg/mL of hygromycin (pWZLhygro vectors) for 4 to 7 days to enrich the transduced cells.
Cell culture and lentiviral infections
For all experiments, cells were cultured in defined growth
media [DMEM supplemented with bovine pancreatic insulin
(10 mg/mL, Sigma), transferrin (10 mg/mL, Calbiochem), HDL
(10 mg/mL, Lee Biosolutions), recombinant murine EGF
(50 ng/mL, Millipore), glutamine (2 mmol/L, Gibco), HEPES
pH 7.4 (10 mmol/L, Gibco), and 0.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Hyclone)] similar to previously described conditions (24, 25).
shATR- (H1UG1 vector) and other shRNA-expressing lentiviruses were produced and titered as described (21). For
shRNA lentivirus infections, 2.5  105 cells were plated on
10-cm plates and infected with concentrated virus at a multiplicity of infection of 10 to 20, typically yielding 95% to 98%
transduction. BrdU (Sigma) labeling (45 minutes) was used to
quantify the S-phase representation as described (21).
Immunoblotting
Whole-cell lysates in 1 sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) lysis
buffer (10% glycerol, 79 mmol/L of SDS, 62.5 mmol/L of Tris,
pH 6.8) were separated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% for H2AX; 10% for Chk1 and GAPDH) and
blotted onto 0.45-mm polyvinylidene difluoride membranes.
Blots were detected for phospho-S139 H2AX (Upstate; JBW301
clone), GAPDH (US Biological), ATR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-S345 Chk1 (Cell Signaling Technologies), and
total Chk1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) according to manufacturers’ instructions.

Mitotic spreads and detection of chromatid breaks and
sister chromatid exchange
Mitotic spreads were prepared as previously described
following a 3- to 4-hour treatment with 0.5 mmol/L of nocodazole (19, 21). To detect and quantify sister chromatid
exchanges (SCEs), cells were incubated with 10 mmol/L of
BrdU (Sigma) for 2 cell doublings and subsequently arrested in
mitosis via nocodazole treatment. Mitotic spreads were prepared, processed, stained with Giemsa, and photographed
using a 100 objective lens. Quantification of chromatid
breaks and SCEs were performed using double-blind methods.
Tumorigenesis in LSL-K-rasG12D mice and histologic
analysis
LSL-K-rasG12D (26, 27), Cre-ERT2þ (28), p53þ/(tm1Tyj), and
ATRþ/ (13) mice were intercrossed to produce the indicated
genotypes (background: 129SvEv/C57BL/6 mixed). Tamoxifen
(20 mg/mL in 98% corn oil:2% ethanol) was administered via a
single intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 0.3 mg (15 mL). Mice
were monitored until death or when euthanized in accordance
with IACUC endpoint criteria. Following necropsy, tissues were
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline at
4 C overnight, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. For gross
histologic examination of lung tissue, 5-mm serial sections were
generated and the 10th section of each series was mounted and
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histopathologic
evaluation. Classification of pulmonary lesions was performed
as described (29). Noted pathologies were tracked across
nearby stained sections (50-mm apart) and quantified per lung
by double-blind methods. Immunohistochemical detection of
p53 was carried out on fixed tumor samples following antigen
unmasking in 10.9 mmol/L of citric acid and inactivation of
endogenous peroxidases with hydrogen peroxide. Incubation
with anti-p53 antibodies (Novocastra; NCL-p53-CM5p, 1:100,
4 C overnight) was followed by detection with goat anti-rabbit
(1:100) HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1 hour at room
temperature) and 3,30 -diaminobenzidine staining. Slides were
washed and stained for 2 minutes with hematoxylin before
mounting and visualization.
Quantitative PCR
Applied Biosystems Primer Express Software 3.0 was utilized for design of quantitative PCR (qPCR) primer and minor
groove binder probe sets to detect the wild-type p53 and
unrecombined LSL-K-rasG12D alleles (Supplementary Table 1).
For p53 allele quantification, primer and probe sets detected
intronic sequences between exons 6 and 7 of wild-type p53, a
region deleted within the p53-null allele. For detection of
mosaic lox recombination of the LSL-K-rasG12D allele, primer
and probe sets (26) were used to amplify and detect sequences
in the transcriptional stop element and flanking a single lox P
site. qPCR was carried out with genomic DNA as a template;
amplification and detection were carried out using TaqMan
Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on an Applied
Biosystems 7900HT sequence detection system. Primer sets
for regional quantification of chromosome 11 (Supplemental
Table S1) were designed using the Primer3Plus program
(UCSC), and qPCR of tumor and tail genomic DNA was carried

out using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems).
Amplification of GAPDH was used as an endogenous control
for all DDCT analyses.
Array-based comparative genomic hybridization
Mouse comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) microarrays (180,000 oligos per array, 4 arrays per chip; Agilent
Technologies) were custom designed using eArray software
(Agilent Technologies), with genomic regions represented at
500-bp intervals within the p53 locus and at 50-kb intervals
throughout the remainder of the mouse genome. Genomic
DNA from tumor and tamoxifen-untreated tail tissue was
utilized for fluorescent probe generation (500 ng of DNA per
probe). Reciprocal labeling and hybridization of tumor and
normal DNA on 2 independent arrays per tumor sample were
carried out (dye-swap) using Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophors. Arrays
were scanned with Agilent Scanner Control software following
manufacture's instructions (Agilent Technologies). Scanned
images from CGH 2-color oligonucleotide arrays were analyzed
using the Partek Genomics Suite (Version 6.5; Partek Inc.).

Results
Oncogenic Ras transformation creates an increased
reliance on the ATR-Chk1 pathway to maintain
genome integrity
Engagement of the ATR-Chk1 pathway maintains genome
stability in response to irregularities in the progression of DNA
replication (9, 15–22). Because hyperactive growth factor signaling and oncogenic stress have each been shown to activate
the ATR-Chk1 pathway in human cells (2–7), we hypothesized
that ATR-Chk1 activation under these conditions may provide
an important genome-stabilizing function. To examine the
effect of ATR-Chk1 pathway inhibition in combination with
oncogene transformation, mouse embryonic fibroblast cell
lines expressing K-rasG12D or H-rasG12V were generated. Ras
expression led to phenotypes characteristic of transformation,
including increased ERK phosphorylation, morphologic
changes, loss of contact inhibition at confluence, and the ability
to produce tumors following transplantation into immunocompromised mice (data not shown).
The ability of oncogenic Ras expression to activate the ATRChk1 pathway in murine cells was confirmed by quantification
of Chk1 phosphorylation on S345, an ATR kinase substrate.
These studies were carried out under defined growth factor
conditions that have been previously shown to ameliorate the
genome destabilizing effects of cell culture and, in subconfluent cultures, cause cell cycling rates to be similar between
untransformed and oncogene-expressing cells (24, 25). In
agreement with previous reports (2–7), a significant increase
in Chk1 phosphorylation was observed in all oncogenic Rasexpressing cell lines in comparison with untransformed controls (Fig. 1A). Activation of Chk1 by Ras transformation
ranged from 150% of control levels under endogenous expression of K-rasG12D to a 3- to 10-fold increase following overexpression of K-rasG12D or H-rasG12V (Fig. 1A).
Because Chk1 phosphorylation by ATR is stimulated to low
levels during normal S-phase progression (9, 10; data not

www.aacrjournals.org

shown), it was conceivable that increased Chk1 phosphorylation in H-rasG12V–transformed cells was the product of a
proportionate increase of cells in S phase. However, arguing
against this possibility, the percentage of H-rasG12V–transformed cells in S phase was either similar to untransformed
controls or elevated insufficiently to account for the fold
increase in Chk1 phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). Notably, the level
of Chk1 phosphorylation observed in H-rasG12V–transformed
cells was similar to that stimulated by the treatment of control
cells with 0.23 mmol/L of aphidicolin (Fig. 1B and C), a
concentration of DNA polymerase inhibitor that only partially
impedes nucleotide incorporation (18). In aggregate, these
studies show that oncogenic Ras activates the ATR pathway in
a manner that is compatible with continued DNA synthesis
and is not the product of increased S-phase representation or
accelerated proliferation rates (Figs. 1 and 3A).
Irregularities in DNA synthesis have been previously shown
to cause an increased reliance on the ATR pathway to suppress double-strand break generation (9, 18, 19, 21, 22). We
reasoned that H-rasG12V–transformation might similarly create a dependence on ATR-Chk1 pathway activation to maintain genome integrity. To test this hypothesis, the effect of
inhibiting the ATR-Chk1 pathway on genome integrity in HrasG12V–transformed cells and untransformed controls was
quantified using 3 hallmarks of genomic instability: H2AX
phosphorylation, SCE, and chromatid breaks.
ATR deficiency in combination with exogenous DNA
polymerase inhibition (e.g., aphidicolin treatment) has previously been shown to stimulate ATM/DNA-PK–dependent
phosphorylation of H2AX in response to increased doublestrand break formation (19, 21). Similarly, ATR/Chk1 pathway inhibition in H-rasG12V expressing cells elevated H2AX
phosphorylation to significantly higher levels than in control
cells (Fig. 2A). Such synergistic increases were observed
using hypomorphic suppression of ATR expression to
15.7% of normal levels [3.8% standard error (SE)] and
following short-term inhibition of Chk1 kinase activity (3hour G€
o6976 treatment; Fig. 2A). These greater than additive
increases in H2AX phosphorylation were observed in multiple independent Ras-transformed cell lines following ATR
suppression (data not shown). Therefore, H-rasG12V expression increases reliance on the ATR-Chk1 pathway to prevent
H2AX phosphorylation during otherwise unperturbed cellcycle progression.
Consistent with an increase in double-strand breaks and
subsequent recombinatorial repair, SCE rates in ATR-suppressed, H-rasG12V–transformed cells were significantly elevated over those observed in control cells (Fig. 2B and D).
Importantly, because the SCE staining procedure measures
recombination frequencies precisely within 2 consecutive
rounds of replication, increased SCE rates in oncogenic
Ras-transformed cells cannot be due to elevated representation of S-phase or increased cell-cycling rates. The ability of
short-term Chk1 inhibition to induce H2AX phosphorylation
in Ras-transformed cells (Fig. 2A) is consistent with this
interpretation. These findings indicate that ATR-Chk1 pathway inhibition in combination with oncogenic stress leads to
an increased utilization of DNA repair responses and that such

blot relative to the levels observed in untransformed controls. GAPDH was additionally detected and quantified as a loading control. Flow cytometric
quantification of S-phase representation was performed in parallel by 45-minute BrdU incorporation and propidium iodide staining. B, Western blot detection

elevated rates of recombination are manifested within the
context of individual cell cycles.
We next examined whether the combination of ATR suppression with oncogenic stress was sufficient to overwhelm
compensatory DNA repair responses (Fig. 2A and B) and lead
to increased chromatid breaks in M phase. Chromosome
spreads were collected from H-rasG12V–transformed and control cells after shRNA-mediated ATR suppression. Remarkably, suppressed expression of ATR in oncogenic Rastransformed cells led to a highly synergistic increase in
chromatid breaks over that observed in control cells
(Fig. 2C and D). This synergistic effect may be produced both
by elevated double-strand break formation (Fig. 2A) and by
cell-cycle checkpoint deficiency, which allows increased transmission of breaks into M phase (19). Similar increases in
chromosome breaks were observed using a distinct shRNA
that targets ATR (Supplementary Fig. 2A and B). Notably, a
portion of these breaks was observed at the Fra14A2 and
Fra8E1 common fragile sites (FHIT and WWOX, respectively;
data not shown), consistent with activation of the ATR pathway serving an important role in suppressing common fragile
site breakage under oncogenic stress. In aggregate, these data
show that ATR pathway activation is relied upon to maintain
genome stability under conditions of oncogenic stress.

Increased chromatid breaks in M phase predict several
potential biological outcomes, depending on the level of
ATR reduction. Because genomic instability was synergistically elevated when ATR suppression was combined with
oncogenic stress (Fig. 2), significant suppression of ATR to
hypomorphic levels might drive genomic instability to intolerable levels in Ras-transformed cells while leaving untransformed counterparts relatively intact. Alternatively, ATR
deficiency might sufficiently compromise cell-cycle control
to permit continued proliferation of Ras-transformed cells,
despite increased genomic instability. Similarly, subtle reduction in ATR expression, such as haploinsufficiency, might
either be sufficient to suppress tumorigenesis initiated by
K-ras or accelerate malignant progression through a variety
of mechanisms, including increased genomic instability and
tumor suppressor gene loss. These distinct possibilities were
tested.
Hypomorphic ATR pathway suppression is synthetic
lethal with oncogenic Ras expression
As described earlier, significant reduction in ATR expression might either i) synergize with Ras-driven oncogenic stress
to generate a level of genomic instability that is incompatible
with continued cell proliferation (synthetic lethality) or ii)

ATR Suppression with Oncogenic Stress Increases Instability

phosphorylation upon ATR-Chk1 pathway suppression in combination with H-rasG12V transformation. ATR-Chk1 pathway was inhibited in H-rasG12V–

H-rasG12V–transformed] and were sufficient to limit Chk1 S345 phosphorylation in response to low-dose aphidicolin (Supplementary Fig. 1). B and C,

suppress cell-cycle checkpoint control and permit the continued proliferation of genetically unstable cells. To test these
hypotheses, shRNA-mediated targeting was used to reduce
ATR expression to 16% of normal levels in H-rasG12V–transformed cells and untransformed controls (Figs. 2 and 3) and
cell proliferation was measured. Within the first 4 days of
culture, hypomorphic ATR suppression did not significantly
affect the proliferation of Ras-transformed or control lines
(Fig. 3A and B), consistent with ineffectual cell-cycle checkpoint responses to the instability observed at day 2 (Fig. 2).
However, by 6 to 8 days, the proliferation of H-rasG12V–
transformed cells was potently suppressed by reduced ATR
expression, ultimately leading to diminished cell numbers
(Fig. 3A). The suppressed proliferation of H-rasG12V–transformed cells was at least partly due to an increased rate of
cell death, based on the elevated frequency of cells with sub-G1
DNA content (Fig. 3C and D). Importantly, although hypomorphic ATR suppression ultimately limited the proliferation
of both cell types (Fig. 3A–D), the antiproliferative effect of ATR

www.aacrjournals.org

reduction on H-rasG12V–transformed cells was significantly
greater than that observed on similarly treated untransformed
controls (Fig. 3A, P ¼ 0.03; Fig. 3D, P ¼ 0.01). This selective
effect was also observed using a distinct shRNA that targets
ATR expression (Supplementary Fig. 2C). Notably, under these
subconfluent conditions, Ras-transformed and untransformed
controls proliferated similarly when wild-type levels of ATR
were expressed (shCTRL-expressing cells; Fig. 3A). These data
indicate that the effect of ATR suppression on proliferation of
Ras-transformed cells is not simply the product of an increased
number of cell cycles in the absence of full ATR expression but,
rather, reflects increased instability on a per-cell-cycle basis.
ATR haploinsufficiency promotes K-rasG12D–induced
tumorigenesis and p53 loss of heterozygosity
Because ATR-Chk1 activation is increased in the presence of
oncogenic stress and during neoplastic transformation, it has
been proposed that ATR and other DNA damage response
genes may serve as barriers to oncogene-driven tumorigenesis

(2–8). Indeed, somatic mutations in ATR-Chk1 pathway components have been observed in human cancers and proposed
to act as driver mutations in lung adenocarcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, and other cancers (30–37). Many of the
mutations thus far characterized are predicted to result in
only partial ATR-Chk1 pathway reduction (28, 30–32, 35, 37).
However, according to our findings (Figs. 2 and 3), ATR
haploinsufficiency in combination with oncogenic stress might
either limit tumorigenesis via synthetic lethality or promote it
through a variety of mechanisms, including increased genomic
instability and accelerated tumor suppressor gene loss.
To test the effect of haploinsufficient ATR expression (13)
on oncogene-induced tumorigenesis, K-rasG12D expression
was induced to endogenous levels in wild-type, ATRþ/,
p53þ/, and ATRþ/p53þ/ mice (Fig. 4A). Induction of
K-rasG12D was accomplished by mosaic lox recombination
of LSL-K-rasG12D knock-in allele (27) in a broad range of
tissues through tamoxifen-mediated activation of a ubiquitously expressed Cre-ERT2 fusion protein (28). Using this
method, recombination of the lox-stop-lox element of KrasG12D knock-in allele ranged from 10% to 23% in analyzed
tissues, as determined by qPCR on genomic DNA, and was not
significantly affected by ATR haploinsufficiency (Fig. 4B).
Mouse survival following K-rasG12D expression was predominantly limited by oral papillomas, which forced euthanasia
due to decreased food intake, and by myeloproliferation

(Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. 3). These previously noted
phenotypes (38–40) were not affected by either ATR or p53
haploinsufficiency, leading to similar median survival times for
the genotypes analyzed (range, 54–81 days). However, upon
necropsy, additional tumor types were revealed and found to
occur at an increased frequency in ATRþ/p53þ/ mice
compared with p53þ/ mice (Fig. 4C and D). These tumors
included thymic lymphomas (CD4þ, CD8þ) and subcutaneous
spindle cell sarcomas (Fig. 4C), each of which was greater than
0.8 cm in diameter at the time of necropsy. Moreover, a
significant increase in the appearance of lung nodules was
observed in ATRþ/p53þ/ (Fig. 4C and D).
K-rasG12D expression has been shown to be sufficient to
stimulate the generation of lung hyperplasias and several
distinct varieties of lung adenoma; however, adenocarcinomas
are most strongly induced in the absence of p53 (26, 38, 41, 42).
To examine the effect of ATR haploinsufficiency on incidence
of these pathologies, lungs from ATRþ/p53þ/ and p53þ/
animals were serial sectioned and quantified for lung
adenomas and adenocarcinomas. Although the incidence of
several common adenoma subtypes was unchanged by ATR
heterozygosity, adenocarcinomas were observed exclusively in
ATRþ/p53þ/ animals, indicating that ATR haploinsufficiency promotes the generation of this malignant form of lung
cancer (Fig. 4E and Supplementary Fig. 4; data not shown).

ATR Suppression with Oncogenic Stress Increases Instability

preneoplasia (29), were also observed in ATRþ/p53þ/ and
not detected in p53þ/ controls (Fig. 4E). Together, these
results show that ATR haploinsufficiency can act as a modifier
of K-rasG12D–induced tumorigenesis in mice.
The increased tumorigenesis in ATRþ/p53þ/ mice in
comparison to p53þ/ controls suggested that ATR haploinsufficiency might drive tumorigenesis through p53 loss of
heterozygosity (LOH). To examine this possibility, 2 procedures were carried out: immunocytochemical detection of p53
protein (Fig. 5A) and real-time qPCR of the wild-type p53 allele
in isolated genomic DNA from tumors (Fig. 5B). As expected
on the basis of tumor incidence, oral papillomas and myelocyte hyperproliferation were not associated with p53 LOH.

However, the tumor types observed at increased incidence in
ATR heterozygous animals had a relatively high frequency of
p53 loss (Fig. 5B). This loss was generally characterized by
intrachromosomal deletions in mouse chromosome 11 that
encompassed the wild-type Trp53 locus at 69.4 Mb, as determined by array CGH and qPCR analysis (Fig. 5C and D). In
aggregate, these data indicate that ATR haploinsufficiency
promotes K-rasG12D–induced tumorigenesis in a manner that
correlates with increased intrachromosomal deletion of the
p53 tumor suppressor gene.

Discussion
Herein, we show that expression of oncogenic Ras in
combination with ATR suppression leads to synergistic
increases in genomic instability, which was not simply the
consequence of increased S-phase representation or elevated
cycling rates following Ras transformation but, rather, was
reflective of a greater dependence on the ATR pathway on a
per-cell-cycle basis (Figs. 1–3). Synergistic increases in genomic instability produced 2 distinct biological outcomes in the
context of oncogenic Ras expression: synthetic lethality upon
substantial reduction of ATR expression (>80%) and tumor
promotion in the context of ATR haploinsufficiency. These
findings indicate that although haploinsufficient loss of ATR
may subtly elevate genomic instability, and thus accelerate
oncogene-driven carcinogenesis, further inhibition of the
ATR-Chk1 pathway can drive genomic instability to intolerable levels and suppress proliferation.
The effect of ATR haploinsufficiency in promoting
K-rasG12D–induced tumorigenesis supports a growing body
of evidence indicating a functional role for mutations in ATR

Figure 4. ATR haploinsufficiency promotes K-rasG12D–induced
tumorigenesis. A, schematic for ubiquitous mosaic activation of the loxstop-lox (LSL) knock-in allele of K-rasG12D in ATR and p53 haploinsufficient
mice. Recombination of the LSL-K-rasG12D allele was achieved through
low-dose tamoxifen (TAM) activation of ubiquitously expressed Cre-ERT2
(28). B, quantification of mosaic lox recombination of the LSL-K-rasG12D
allele in various tissues. Real-time qPCR analysis of genomic DNA was
carried out on tissues isolated from LSL-K-rasG12D/þCre-ERT2þ mice
(ATRþ/þ, n ¼ 3; and ATRþ/, n ¼ 6) 5 days after low-dose TAM treatment.
Standard errors are indicated (bars). C, tumorigenesis in ATRþ/p53þ/ and
control mice following Cre-mediated mosaic expression of K-rasG12D. The
LSL-K-rasG12D/þCre-ERT2þ mice analyzed were ATRþ/þ (n ¼ 18), ATRþ/ (n
¼ 17), p53þ/ (n ¼ 20), and ATRþ/p53þ/ (n ¼ 14). Tumors were identified
upon necropsy or following IACUC-determined euthanasia endpoints, and
the percentages of affected mice are shown. D, average number of grossly
apparent lung nodules following mosaic activation of the LSL-K-rasG12D
allele in ATR and p53 haploinsufficient mice. Nodules were quantified on
fixed lungs isolated from low-dose TAM–treated LSL-K-rasG12D/þCreERT2þ mice with the indicated heterozygous deletions in ATR and p53
(n  13 mice per genotype). E, ATR haploinsufficiency promotes K-rasG12D–
induced lung adenocarcinoma in p53 heterozygous mice. Quantification of
adenoma subtypes and adenocarcinoma was carried out on lung tissue
isolated from low-dose TAM–treated LSL-K-rasG12D/þCre-ERT2þ mice
with the additional genotypes indicated. Blinded analysis of H&E-stained
serial sectioning (1 per 50 mm, 24–39 sections in total were analyzed per
lung) was carried out, and adenoma subtypes and adenocarcinoma were
classified as described (29). SEs (bars) were calculated from 3 or more
independent PCR reactions (B) or from nodules per lung (n  13 mice; D). P
value (E) was calculated by Fisher's exact test.

representation is shown relative to homozygous wild-type levels (p53þ/þ). SEs (bars) were calculated from technical replicates. Tumor samples in which the
wild-type p53 allele frequency was significantly reduced are indicated (red asterisks). Enrichment of K-rasG12D–expressing cells in tumor isolates was
determined by qPCR of LSL-K-rasG12D lox recombination (Supplementary Fig. 5). C, detection of intrachromosomal deletion of p53 by array CGH and qPCR

ATR Suppression with Oncogenic Stress Increases Instability

pathway components in human carcinogenesis. Somatic
mutations in ATR have been identified in colon, stomach,
and endometrial cancers (30–32, 35) and may influence lung
adenocarcinoma progression (33, 34). In addition, a variant of
Rad9, a component of the ATR-Chk1 pathway (9), has been
shown to be strongly associated with increased risk of non–
small cell lung cancer in humans (37). Mutations within a
similar region in an Saccharomyces cerevisiae orthologue of
human Rad9 (S. cerevisiae Ddc1) disrupts checkpoint signaling
in response to DNA damage, suggesting that the human Rad9
variant may be functionally compromised (43). Indeed, mutation or suppression of Chk1 has been noted in colon, stomach,
and endometrial cancers and select B-cell lymphomas (30, 31,
35). These genetic association studies in humans are consistent with findings indicating that suppression of ATR-Chk1
pathway components promotes tumorigenesis in select tumor
models (13, 44–46).
According to our studies, the stimulatory effect of ATRChk1 pathway haploinsufficiency on tumorigenesis may be
potently influenced by the increased reliance on ATR-Chk1
function produced by oncogenic stress (Figs. 1 and 2). Along
these lines, ATR-Chk1 pathway haploinsufficiency may drive
tumorigenesis either through subtle alleviation of cell-cycle
control or through increased genome destabilization (Fig. 2).
Notably, the expected low levels of genomic instability
caused by ATR haploinsufficiency seem to be sufficient to
promote the complete loss of tumor suppressor genes, such
as p53 (Fig. 5), which may ultimately abrogate checkpoint
function more effectively than ATR haploinsufficiency alone.
These findings may be useful in correlating tumor suppressor gene loss with candidate genetic modifiers in genomewide association studies of human cancers. Moreover, detection of ATR-Chk1 pathway mutations may provide relevant
prognostic indicators (47) and assist in choosing effective
cancer treatment strategies, which could include inhibition
of the ATR-Chk1 pathway, as discussed in the following text.
Chk1 has previously been proposed to be a potential target
for cancer treatment, most notably in combination with p53
deficiency (48). Indeed, Chk1 inhibitors are currently in phase I
and II clinical trials for the treatment of a variety of solid and
hematologic malignancies (36, 48, 49). The studies described
herein support the use of ATR-Chk1 pathway inhibition in
cancer therapy. Because ATR phosphorylates a variety of DNA
damage response intermediates in addition to Chk1 and selective Chk1 inhibition ultimately causes ATR activation (9, 10, 50),
it is not known whether ATR inhibition will be identical in
efficacy to Chk1 suppression in cancer treatment. Nevertheless,

each kinase plays an important role in replication fork stabilization (9, 10), which is potentially the key function required for
genome maintenance in the context of oncogenic stress and
other conditions. Given the deleterious effect of complete ATRChk1 pathway ablation on normal tissue homeostasis (28), a
critical determinant of the utility of this treatment will be
identifying the genetic characteristics of cancers that cause
selective sensitization to partial ATR-Chk1 inhibition.
Oncogenic Ras mutations are observed frequently in
human cancers and are associated with some of the currently least treatable malignancies including pancreatic,
lung, ovarian, and colon cancer. Thus, ATR-Chk1 pathway
inhibition may provide therapeutic opportunities for which
few alternatives are available. Many of the cancers associated with expression of oncogenic Ras also harbor mutations in p53, which as mentioned earlier is reported to
produce an increased sensitivity to ATR-Chk1 pathway
inhibition (36, 48, 49). Along these lines, the greatest effect
of ATR-Chk1 inhibition in cancer treatment may be achieved
through the combined effects of these genetic interactions
(e.g., p53 loss and oncogenic stress) and others, including
somatic mutations within the ATR-Chk1 pathway (30–37) or
other DNA damage response genes, for example, ATM and
H2AX (21, 34, 42). Thus, it is conceivable that malignancies
harboring such combined genetic characteristics may be
prime candidates for treatments utilizing ATR-Chk1 pathway inhibition.
