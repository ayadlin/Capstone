ABSTRACT
Brahma related gene product 1 (BRG1) is an ATPase that drives the catalytic
activity of a subset of the mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling enzymes. BRG1
is overexpressed in most human breast cancer tumors without evidence of mutation
and is required for breast cancer cell proliferation. We demonstrate that knockdown
of BRG1 sensitized triple negative breast cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs
used to treat breast cancer. An inhibitor of the BRG1 bromodomain had no effect on
breast cancer cell viability, but an inhibitory molecule that targets the BRG1 ATPase
activity recapitulated the increased drug efficacy observed in the presence of BRG1
knockdown. We further demonstrate that inhibition of BRG1 ATPase activity blocks
the induction of ABC transporter genes by these chemotherapeutic drugs and that
BRG1 binds to ABC transporter gene promoters. This inhibition increased intracellular
concentrations of the drugs, providing a likely mechanism for the increased
chemosensitivity. Since ABC transporters and their induction by chemotherapy drugs
are a major cause of chemoresistance and treatment failure, these results support
the idea that targeting the enzymatic activity of BRG1 would be an effective adjuvant
therapy for breast cancer.

INTRODUCTION

overcome by combinatorial treatment with drugs acting
via different mechanisms, but cancer cells often evolve
simultaneous resistance to different structurally and
functionally unrelated drugs, a phenomenon known
as multidrug resistance (MDR) [7, 8]. Resistance to
anticancer drugs arises by various mechanisms and
especially by the genetic instability of tumor cells driving
heterogeneity. While therapies have become more targeted
and effective, acquired resistance has remained the
principal basis for treatment failure [9, 10].
One common reason for resistance to multiple
anticancer drugs is the increased expression of one or
more energy-dependent transporters that result in efflux
of the drugs from cells [11, 12]. The first identification of
a molecular mechanism of multidrug resistance was the
identification of an energy-dependent drug efflux pump,
known as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or MDR1, the multidrug

Drugs that target genomically defined vulnerabilities
in human tumors have been effective cancer therapies
for decades [1]. The specificity of cancer drugs has
progressively improved, from general cytotoxic agents
such as nitrogen mustard in the 1940s [2] to naturalproduct anticancer drugs such as Vinca alkaloids and
anthracyclines in the 1960s [3], to specific monoclonal
antibodies [4], immunotoxins [5], and small molecules
targeting cell surface receptors and growth-promoting
signal transduction pathways [6]. Increased specificity
has improved patient response rates while reducing the
side effects of anticancer treatment. However, the rapid
acquisition of resistance to drug treatments remains
a substantial challenge to the clinical management of
advanced cancers. Resistance to single drugs can be

transporter [13, 14]. The product of the human MDR1
gene [15] and the products of two different but related
mouse genes, Mdr1a and Mdr1b [16, 17], were among
the first described members of a large family of ATPdependent transporters known as the ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) family [18]. From the 48 known ABC transporters
[19], members of three subfamilies are important for drug
efflux from cells: (i) MDR1 P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) from
the “B” subfamily, which was the first identified ABC
drug efflux transporter and has been the most completely
characterized [11]; (ii) several multidrug resistance related
protein (MRP) transporters from the “C” subfamily
(ABCC1, ABCC2, ABCC3, ABCC4, ABCC5, ABCC10,
ABCC11) [20-22] and (iii) ABCG2/BCRP from the “G”
subfamily [23].
The SWI/SNF enzymes control gene expression
through ATP-dependent remodeling of chromatin.
Mammalian SWI/SNF complexes contain mutually
exclusive ATPase subunits, either BRM (SMARCA2),
or BRG1 (SMARCA4) [24-26]. SWI/SNF complexes
containing BRG1 control cell proliferation, cell lineage
differentiation and maintain cell pluripotency during
early embryonic development [27-33]. A growing body
of evidence suggests that BRG1 exhibits both tumor
suppressing and tumor promoting functions, depending
on the type of cancer [32]. Results published by us and
by others demonstrate that the SWI/SNF ATPases BRG1
and BRM are up-regulated in primary breast cancer
and are required for cancer cell proliferation in vitro
and in vivo [27, 33]. These results suggest that BRG1,
as a driver of proliferation, could be a drugable target
in certain cancer types. In addition, BRG1 promotes
chemoresistance in lung cancer cells [34], where BRG1
wildtype tumors upregulate BRG1 in response to EZH2
inhibitor and become more resistant to TOPOII inhibitor.
In pancreatic tumors, BRG1 knockdown effectively
reverses chemoresistance to gemcitabine [35].
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women
and one of the leading causes of cancer death for women,
with triple negative breast cancer being the most invasive
and life threatening [36-39]. Triple negative breast cancer
has been shown to be highly glycolytic, metastatic, and
chemotherapy resistant; currently there are no standard
of care effective targeted therapies to combat triple
negative breast cancer. Therefore, both early stage
and advanced triple negative breast cancer tumors are
treated with predominantly cytotoxic chemotherapy. We
previously reported that reduction of BRG1 results in
slow proliferation in triple negative breast cancer cells in
vitro and in xenografts [33]. We report here that depletion
of BRG1 or an inhibitor targeting the BRG1 ATPase
domain sensitized triple negative breast cancer cells to
chemotherapeutic drugs. BRG1 inhibition prevented
chemotherapy drug-mediated induction of genes encoding
specific ABC transporter proteins. We conclude that
targeting the ATPase domain of BRG1, in combination

with other chemotherapy drugs, is a promising strategy
for breast cancer treatment.

RESULTS
Breast tumors are heterogeneous with subtypes
defined by pathology [40] and gene expression profiles
[41]. Since we were studying chemotherapy drug efflux,we
chose to focus on the subtype with the most resistance to
those drugs, the most treatment failures, and the worst
prognosis for patients [36]. These ‘triple negative’ tumors
lack estrogen receptor α, lack the progesterone receptor,
and do not have HER2 upregulation.

BRG1 depletion sensitized triple negative breast
cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs
We tested the efficacy of six chemotherapy drugs
on MDA-MB-231 cells expressing doxycyline-inducible
shRNA targeting BRG1. Doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU), gemcitabine, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and
paclitaxel are used clinically for treating breast cancer
patients. Doxorubicin induces DNA double-strand
breaks. 5-FU and gemcitabine are nucleoside analogs.
Cisplatin crosslinks DNA, while cyclophosphamide
alkylates and crosslinks DNA. Paclitaxel prevents normal
breakdown of microtubules during mitosis. These drugs
are structurally unrelated and have different mechanisms
of action. Reduction of BRG1 expression significantly
improved the efficacy of each of these drugs (Figure 1A1F, Supplemental Figure 1A) as judged by cell viability
in MTS assays [42]. The IC50 values were decreased 4
to 10 fold, supporting the concept that BRG1 reduction
or inhibition might be effective as an adjunct to currently
used chemotherapies.

A BRG1 ATPase domain inhibitor decreased
breast cancer cell proliferation
Only two BRG1 inhibitors have been reported. PFI3, or (2E)-1-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-3-[(1R,4R)-5-(pyridin-2yl)-2,5-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-yl]prop-2-en-1-one, a
small molecule inhibitor that specifically targets the bromo
domains of BRG1, BRM, and PB1, is a Pfizer/ Structural
Genomics Consortium candidate with in vitro potency
in isothermal titration calorimetry at < 100 nM dose
(http://www.thesgc.org/chemical-probes/PFI-3; [43, 44]).
Previously, we reported that depletion of BRG1 in triple
negative breast cancer cell lines reduced cell proliferation
[33]. We treated three triple negative breast cancer cell
lines, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and HDQ-P1, with
PFI-3 at different doses. No inhibition of cell proliferation
was observed, even at the 10 μM dose as measured by
MTT assay [45] (Figure 2A). This is consistent with
recent results demonstrating that PFI-3 did not affect the

ADAADiN treatment increased breast cancer cell
sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs

proliferation rate of other cancer cell lines [44].
The bacterial APH (3’)-III enzyme that encodes for
aminoglycoside resistance generates a minor product that
can be chromatographically separated from the known
3’-phosphoaminoglycoside product as well as from the
parental aminoglycoside. This product, named ADAADi
(Active DNA-dependent ATPase A Domain inhibitor),
inhibits the ATPase activity of the SWI2/SNF2 family
of ATPases [46, 47]. Enzymes from other families of
DNA-dependent ATPases showed no or greatly reduced
sensitivity to ADAADi, and DNA-independent or RNAdependent ATPases were not affected [47]. Prior studies
indicated that ADAADi inhibited BRG1 nucleosome
remodeling activity in vitro [47]. ADAADi derived
from different aminoglycosides behaves similarly in all
tested assays [46]; here we utilized ADAADi derived
from neomycin (ADAADiN). We tested the ADAADiN
inhibitor on three triple negative lines: MDA-MB-231,
MDA-MB-468 and HDQ-P1. ADAADiN significantly
decreased cell proliferation in these cell lines (Figure
2B-2E). However, ADAADiN failed to decrease cell
proliferation significantly in cells with reduced BRG1
expression (Figure 3A-3B; Supplemental Figure 1B).
This observation strongly suggests that ADAADiN
targeted BRG1 in these cells by interfering with its ATPase
function.
Brahma (BRM) is highly homologous to BRG1
[25, 48] and can also function as the catalytic subunit of
mammalian SWI/SNF enzymes in a manner mutually
exclusive of BRG1 [26]. ADAADiN decreased cell
proliferation to roughly the same extent as shRNA
mediated knockdown of BRM (Supplemental Figure 1 and
2). However, the combination of ADAADiN and shRNA
targeting BRM further decreased proliferation in a manner
that is statistically significant and additive (Supplemental
Figure 2). This finding is in contrast to the results obtained
for treatment of cells with a combination of ADAADiN
and shRNA targeting BRG1 (Figure 3) and suggests that
ADAADiN specifically targets BRG1 in these cells.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Since ADAADiN inhibited breast cancer cell
proliferation, we asked if it could also sensitize cells to
chemotherapeutic drugs, just as BRG1 knockdown does.
Following pretreatment with ADAADiN, cells were
exposed to different doses of the same chemotherapy
drugs, and cell viability was assayed by MTT assay.
ADAADiN significantly increased the chemotherapeutic
sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells
from 3- to well over 10-fold (Table 1). These data establish
the concept that chemical inhibition of the BRG1 ATPase
domain might be used to target BRG1 mediated prosurvival pathways in breast cancer cells.

ADAADiN blocked induction of drug transporter
gene expression in response to drug treatment
ABC transporters mediate the efflux of anti-cancer
drugs and are critically involved in multidrug resistance
[21, 49-51]; the expression of ABC transporters is upregulated in patients after neoadjuvant therapy [52]. We
first surveyed nine ABC transporter genes to determine
whether BRG1 contributed to their expression in MDAMB-231 cells. The results show that BRG1 contributed to
the endogenous level of transporter gene expression for
seven of the genes (Supplemental Figure 3).
Since ADAADiN sensitized breast cancer cells to
chemotherapeutic drugs, we hypothesized that ADAADiN
treatment might inhibit the transcriptional activation of
the transporter genes upon chemotherapy drug treatment.
From the literature, we identified six instances where
ABC transporter genes are transcriptionally activated in
response to one or more of the chemotherapeutic drugs
used in our study. Each of the triple negative breast cancer
cell lines were treated with vehicle alone or with one of
the chemotherapy drugs at the IC50, dose and specific
transporter mRNA levels were compared to levels present
in cells exposed to drug plus ADAADiN.
ABCC11 was previously identified as a 5-FU efflux
transporter that directly confers resistance to 5-FU [53,

54]. We observed up-regulation of ABCC11 expression in
each of the three triple negative cell lines when treated
with 5-FU, and this activation was attenuated in the
presence of ADAADiN (Figure 4A).
Minegaki et al [55] reported that ABCC2 mRNA
levels increased in a dose-dependent manner when treated
with 5-FU. ABCC2 expression was increased more than

2-fold in all three cell lines when treated with an IC50
dose of 5-FU. When co-treated with ADAADiN, ABCC2
mRNA levels were significantly decreased (Figure 4B).
ABCC2 also mediates cisplatin resistance and this is
correlated with clinical outcome [56, 57]. In our study,
cisplatin up-regulated ABCC2 expression by 4-fold in
MDA-MB-468 cells. Activation in MDA-MB-231 and

HDQ-P1 cells was less than 2-fold but was nevertheless
statistically significant. However, the up-regulation of
ABCC2 in each of the three cell lines was inhibited by
co-treatment with ADAADiN (Figure 4C).
The expression of ABCG1 is increased in breast
cancer patients during neoadjuvant therapy with
5-fluorouracil-doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide,
and
increased levels of ABCG1 predict poor prognosis [58].
ABCG1 expression increased in each of the cell lines
when treated with cyclophosphamide, while the presence
of ADAADiN suppressed ABCG1 up-regulation (Figure
4D).
Targeting ABCC2 by antisense RNA reduces the
doxorubicin IC50 value by 12-fold in hepatocellular
carcinoma cells, whereas overexpression of ABCC2 in
HEK293 cells enhances doxorubicin resistance around
8-fold [56, 59]. These results suggest that ABCC2 is
the efflux transporter for doxorubicin. When the three
triple negative breast cancer lines were treated with the
IC50 dose of doxorubicin, it caused a greater than 3-fold
induction of ABCC2 in MDA-MB-231 and HDQ-P1
cells, and a modest but statistically significant increase in
MDA-MB-468 cells. The addition of ADAADiN blocked
ABCC2 induction in each cell line (Figure 4E).
ABCB1 is overexpressed in gemcitabine resistant
pancreatic cells and in side population cells with high
gemcitabine efflux capacity [60, 61]. In non-small-cell
lung cancer cells, ABCB1 mRNA levels can predict
gemcitabine chemosensitivity [62]. Homology modeling
and docking of ABCB1 showed gemcitabine to be a highaffinity substrate [63]. In the three triple negative lines
tested, ABCB1 was strongly induced by gemcitabine
treatment, but ADAADiN treatment effectively blocked
its induction (Figure 4F).
EGFR-mediated overexpression of ABCG2 is
associated with paclitaxel resistance in drug resistant
MCF-7 cells [64]. Silencing ABCB1 and ABCG2 by
nanoparticle-facilitated siRNA in MCF-7 cells increases
chemosensitivity to paclitaxel [65, 66]. As shown in
Figure 4G-4H, the expression of ABCB1 and ABCG2
was up-regulated in each of the three cell lines treated
with paclitaxel. However, the presence of ADAADiN
significantly blocked the activation of these genes. In
summary, ADAADiN treatment blocked the transcriptional
induction of drug transporters by chemotherapeutic drugs,
which may contribute to the increase chemosensivity in
ADAADiN treated cells.

this study, we used only 14C-5-FU and 3H-paclitaxel to
test this hypothesis. The uptake of the radiolabeled drugs
was identical in cell cultures expressing control shRNA
or shRNA targeting BRG1 (Figure 5A-5B). Subsequent
analysis of cell cultures that were pulse-chased with
the drugs showed that BRG1 knockdown resulted in
increased intracellular retention of the drugs (Figure 5C5D). We conclude that BRG1-dependent induction of drug
transporter gene expression by 5-FU and Paclitaxel results
in increased intracellular concentrations of the drugs. This
may explain the increased chemosensitivity of cells that
express reduced levels of BRG1 or that are treated with a
BRG1 inhibitor.

Drug treatment increased BRG1 binding at drug
transporter promoters
SWI/SNF enzymes regulate gene expression
by altering chromatin structure, and BRG1 binds to
chromatin at many genes that are actively transcribed
[30, 32]. We asked whether BRG1 is directly involved in
the drug-induced transcriptional activation of the tested
transporters. Binding of BRG1 at transporter genes was
examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with vehicle or with
individual chemotherapeutic drugs at the IC50 dose, and
these results were compared to results from cells treated
with ADAADiN prior to and during induction with the
chemotherapeutic drug. BRG1 binding sites at transporter
genes promoters were predicted from BRG1 ChIP-seq
data deposited for HeLa and K562 cells [67, 68]. 5-FU
treatment enhanced BRG1 binding at ABCC2 by 3-fold
and ABCC11 by 2-fold, and ADAADiN had no effect on
BRG1 binding at these genes (Figure 6A). This result is
consistent with the idea that ADAADiN inhibits ATPase
activity but has no effect on the ability of the enzyme
to bind to chromatin [46]. Cisplatin increased BRG1
enrichment at ABCC2 more than 3-fold, and co-treatment
with ADAADiN did not change BRG1 binding (Figure
6B). Similar results were seen in cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicine, gemcitabine and paclitaxel treated cells,
where these drugs significantly increased BRG1 binding
at target drug transporter genes and ADAADiN showed
no effect on BRG1 binding (Figure 6C-6F). We were
unable to examine BRG1 binding at the ABCG2 locus in
paclitaxel treated cells, as there were no BRG1 binding
sites identified at this locus in reported ChIP-seq data sets
in different cell contexts. Overall, chemotherapeutic drugs
increased BRG1 binding to drug transporter genes, and
these binding events were not affected by the ADAADiN
BRG1 ATPase inhibitor.
PFI-3, a compound targeting the bromodomain of
BRG1, BRM, and PB1 [44] had no effect on proliferation
of any of the breast cancer cell lines tested (Figure
2A). This is consistent with recent work of others using

different cancer cell lines [44] showing that PFI-3 was
unable to dislodge BRM from chromatin, either globally or
at specific gene loci. We performed ChIP assays to address

whether BRG1 remained bound in the presence of PFI-3.
Eight transporter genes were examined for the binding of
BRG1 in proliferating MDA-MB-231 cells. Four of the

eight transporter genes tested had BRG1 binding. PFI-3
had no effect on the extent of BRG1 binding observed at
any of the loci (Supplemental Figure 4). These data are
consistent with the prior observation that PFI-3 could
not displace BRM from chromatin [44] and extend those
findings by showing that PFI-3 also cannot dislodge BRG1
from chromatin.

associated with poor prognosis (Figure 7). This result
provides independent corroboration of a prior study [27]
linking BRG1 levels with poor clinical outcomes of breast
cancer patients. That conclusion, like our analysis of
patient data here, was not limited to triple negative tumors,
which make up only about 15% of patient tumors. Future
studies will need to determine whether specific breast
tumor subtypes have a negative BRG1 level correlation
with prognosis.
Our results show that BRG1 knockdown or
inhibition increases chemosensitivity and decreases druginduced increases in ABC transporter gene expression.
This suggests that BRG1 overexpression that is normally
observed in primary breast tumors [27, 33] may result in
elevated ABC transporter gene expression and possible
chemoresistance. We might therefore expect that
transporter gene expression would correlate with BRG1
expression. The microarray datasets used for correlating
high BRG1 expression with decreased survival were
interrogated for expression levels of the transporter genes
that were stimulated by chemotherapeutic drugs in a
BRG1-dependent manner (Figure 4). Three of these genes
(ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCG2) showed increased levels of
expression that correlated with BRG1 expression, whereas
one of the genes (ABCG1) showed an inverse correlation
(Supplemental Figure 5). The fifth gene, ABCC11, was
not present in the microarray datasets. It is important to
remember, however, that levels of specific transporter gene
expression were generated from the combined dataset
representing patients with a spectrum of breast cancers and
that the majority of samples were isolated upon biopsy

BRG1 expression level correlated with breast
cancer patient survival
To determine the correlation between BRG1
expression and breast cancer patient survival, we
retrieved 7 microarray datasets of human breast cancer
(GSE1456, GSE2034, GSE2990, GSE3494, GSE12093,
GSE11121 and Chin et al., combined N = 1339) profiled
on Affymetrix HG-U133A platform [69-75] from Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/geo) and European Bioinformatics Institute (http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress for Chin et al, 2006 [75]).
We normalized these datasets using MAS 5.0 software
in GeneSpring 12.0 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
CA), scaled to a mean target intensity of 600, and log2
transformed. 88 samples from GSE2990 were also used in
GSE3494, and thus excluded from GSE2990. 23 samples
without survival information and 7 samples with distance
metastasis-free survival of 0 were excluded, which left

is linked to BRG1 expression.

by two experiments. First, the combination of ADAADiN
treatment and BRG1 knockdown resulted in an inhibition
of cell proliferation that was not statistically different
from either treatment alone. Second, whereas knockdown
of the BRG1 homologue BRM and ADAADiN treatment
provided similar inhibition of breast cancer cell
proliferation, the combination of the two resulted in an
apparent additive effect on proliferation. This suggests
that ADAADiN does not or minimally targets BRM
in these cells. Thus, one or more molecules that could
simultaneously target BRG1 and BRM might have greater
potential as a therapeutic agent. Furthermore, ADAADiN
treatment, like BRG1 knockdown, increased the sensitivity
of triple negative breast cancer cells to chemotherapeutic
drugs that are used clinically (Table 1). These results are
consistent with the observation that the ATPase domain of
BRG1 is required for GR-mediated transactivation [83]
and leukemia cell proliferation [82]. In addition, though
the chemotherapeutic agents used in this study have
diverse mechanisms of action, none directly target an
epigenetic regulator, suggesting that combining epigenetic
therapies with conventional chemotherapies has great
potential in combinatorial drug approaches to treating
cancer. Future work will be needed to further explore this
possibility. Xenografts and animal models could be used
to probe the efficacy of BRG1 inhibitors. Both in vitro and
in vivo approaches to understanding differences in BRG1
functions in normal compared to cancer cells will help
inform attempts to improve screening or design of new
inhibitors.
The work presented here supports for the idea that
targeting BRG1 in breast cancer and in other cancers
such as melanoma and colorectal, gastric, and prostate
cancer [84-88] could be therapeutic via mechanisms that
reduce cell proliferation and increase chemosensitivity.
Coupled with recent proposals on targeting the BRG1
homologue BRM in BRG1-deficient tumors [89-92], it
is apparent that strategies for targeting the human SWI/
SNF enzyme ATPases in context-dependent manners will
be an expanding area of focus. Indeed, these advances are
only part of a larger movement demonstrating that broad
classes of epigenetic regulatory proteins are viable targets
for novel cancer therapies [93].

DISCUSSION
Small molecule inhibition of the BRG1 ATPase
domain is a promising therapeutic strategy
Previous work by us and others indicates that BRG1
is overexpressed in most breast tumors regardless of
classification and that BRG1 knockdown in triple negative
breast cancer cells caused a slow proliferation phenotype
[27, 33]. Here we report that BRG1 knockdown cells have
increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs currently
used to treat breast cancer (Figure 1), suggesting that
targeting BRG1 may be a viable approach to augmenting
current therapeutic regimens.
Delivery to and continued expression of knockdown
vectors in most tissues and specifically in tumors
presents significant challenges [76]. Identification of
small molecule inhibitors, in contrast, has been an
effective therapeutic approach for decades. PFI-3 is a
cell-permeable small molecule inhibitor that specifically
targets the bromodomains of BRG1, BRM, and a third
mammalian SWI/SNF subunit, Polybromo (BAF180)
via tight interaction [44, 77]. Bromodomains bind to
acetylated chromatin and therefore have a targetable
molecular function [78-80]. A recent study showed that
PFI-3 treated embryonic stem cells lost stemness and
deregulated lineage specification. Exposure of trophoblast
stem cells to PFI-3 markedly enhanced differentiation
[43]. These results emphasize a key function of the BRG1
bromodomain in stem cell maintenance and differentiation.
However, PFI-3, unlike BRG1 knockdown, did not change
the proliferation rate of triple negative breast cancer cells
at any concentration (Figure 2A), nor did it displace
BRG1 from chromatin at specific gene loci (Supplemental
Figure 4). These results are consistent with a recent
study indicating that PFI-3 failed to alter proliferation in
multiple tumor cell types in which BRG1 or BRM was
mutated or deficient. In that report, the drug was unable
to displace endogenous BRM from chromatin, suggesting
at least one reason for its lack of effect [44]. The data are
also consistent with studies showing that the C-terminal
portion of BRG1, which includes the bromodomain, was
dispensable for glucocorticoid receptor-mediated gene
induction [81] and that the BRG1 ATPase domain, not the
bromo domain, is required for leukemia cell proliferation
[82].
In contrast, ADAADiN [46, 47] targets the BRG1
ATPase domain and in our study decreased breast cancer
cell proliferation (Figure 2B-2E). The specificity of
ADAADi for BRG1 in the cells tested was demonstrated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Regulation of ABC transporter genes by BRG1
Reduction of BRG1 levels or interference with
BRG1 catalytic function reduces breast cancer cell
proliferation, and yet these slow proliferating cells are
more sensitive to cytotoxic agents that preferentially
target rapidly growing cells. This paradox prompted us to
investigate BRG1 effects on the expression of transporters
responsible for drug trafficking in cancer cells. Our data
show that BRG1 is a regulator of ABC transporters that are
implicated as efflux transporters for chemotherapy drugs
[94]. ADAADiN inhibited drug-mediated up-regulation of
27169

specific transporter genes, indicating a functional role for
BRG1. Demonstration that BRG1 was bound to sequences
near each transporter gene’s transcription start site
indicates a direct role for BRG1 during therapeutic drug
mediated gene activation. Together these data suggest a
possible mechanism for the increased sensitivity of breast
cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs.
It has been shown that more than half of the ABC
transporters are involved in drug resistance using the
NCI60 cell line panel [95]. This redundancy in transporter
function has limited therapeutic approaches that target
specific transporters. For example, MDR1 inhibitors such
as zosuquidar and tariquidar failed in clinical trials despite
their high potency and specificity [96]. Our discovery that
catalytic activity of BRG1 is required for the up-regulation
of multiple ABC transporters in response to drug treatment
pioneers a new pan-transporter approach to combating
drug resistance by targeting BRG1.

Cells were plated and incubated overnight before
treatment with increasing doses of drugs for 72 hours
to determine the IC50 value. When combined with
ADAADiN treatment, cells were pre-treated with 2 μM
ADAADiN for 48 hours and then different drugs were
added to culture medium at the IC50 value incubated for
another 24 hours and collected for analysis.

Drug uptake and retention studies
MDA-MB-231 scram and shBRG1 cells were
treated with doxycycline to induce BRG1 knockdown as
described previously [33]. Cells were then treated with
0.1 μCi 3H-Paclitaxel or 14C-5-Fluorouracil for 1 hour or
6 hours, respectively. Uptake of radiolabeled drug was
measured after washing the cells repeatedly, cell counting,
and scintillation counting. For assessing drug retention,
labeled cells were washed 3 times with PBS to remove
residual labeling medium and replaced with growth
medium containing doxycycline and 100 μM paclitaxel
or 1 mM 5-FU for an additional 2 hours before harvest.
All cells, including any floating cells, were collected,
counted and lysed by addition of 0.5 N NaOH. Cell lysates
were analyzed by scintillation counting. Readouts were
normalized by cell number.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained from T. Guise
[97]. MDA-MB-468 cells were obtained from ATCC.
HDQ-P1 cells were purchased from DSMZ (Leibniz
Institute DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms
and Cell Culture, 38124 Braunschweig, Germany.
MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and HDQ-P1 cells
were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS and Penicillin/Streptomycin. BRG1 knockdown
by doxycycline-inducible shRNA expression in MDAMB-231 cells was performed as previously described
[33]. siRNA mediated knockdown of BRG1 in MDAMB-468 and HDQ-P1 cells was performed using
reagents and methods previously described [33, 98]. The
identities of all four triple negative breast tumor lines were
authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat profiling at the
Genetic Resources Core Facility, Johns Hopkins School
of Medicine, Institute of Genetic Medicine.

MTS assay
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5,000 cells/
well) overnight prior to drug treatment, and were then
maintained in the presence of vehicle or drug for 72
hours before addition of 20 μL CellTiter 96 AQueous One
Solution per well. Plates were incubated for 2 hours before
absorbances at 490 nm were measured with a Synergy H4
Hybrid microplate reader (Bio Tek, Winooski, VT).

MTT assay
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5,000 cells/
well) overnight prior to drug treatment, and were then
maintained in presence of vehicle or drug for 72 hours
before addition of MTT solution (5 ug/mL). Plates
were incubated for 4 hours in MTT solution, then the
media was removed and plates were air-dried. One
hundred microliters of DMSO were added to each well
and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes with
gentle shaking before the absorbances were measured as
described above.

Reagents
