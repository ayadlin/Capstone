Summary

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Growth of prostate cancer cells is dependent upon androgen stimulation of the androgen receptor
(AR). Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the most potent androgen, is usually synthesized in the prostate
from testosterone secreted by the testis. Following chemical or surgical castration, prostate cancers
usually shrink owing to testosterone deprivation. However, tumors often recur, forming castrationresistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Here, we show that CRPC sometimes expresses a gain-ofstability mutation leading to a gain-of-function in 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1
(3βHSD1), which catalyzes the initial rate-limiting step in the conversion of the adrenal-derived
steroid dehydroepiandrosterone to DHT. The mutation (N367T) does not affect catalytic function,
but it renders the enzyme resistant to ubiquitination and degradation, leading to profound
accumulation. Whereas dehydroepiandrosterone conversion to DHT is usually very limited,
expression of 367T accelerates this conversion and provides the DHT necessary to activate the
AR. We suggest that 3βHSD1 is a valid target for the treatment of CRPC.

Introduction
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The growth of cancerous prostate cells requires stimulation of the androgen receptor (AR)
by androgens, the most potent of which is dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Advanced prostate
cancer usually initially regresses with gonadal testosterone (T) deprivation therapy (i.e.,
medical or surgical castration), but it almost always eventually progresses as castrationresistant prostate cancer (CRPC) (Attard et al., 2009; Penning, 2010; Scher and Sawyers,
2005; Sharifi et al., 2005; Yuan and Balk, 2009). The CRPC phenotype is driven by a gainof-function in the androgen receptor (AR) that is usually accompanied by intratumoral DHT
concentrations of about 1 nM, which is sufficient to drive expression of AR-induced genes,
including the TMPRSS2-ETS fusion oncogene (Geller et al., 1978; Luu-The et al., 2008;
Montgomery et al., 2008; Sharifi, 2013; Titus et al., 2005; Tomlins et al., 2005). The
requirement for intratumoral androgen synthesis in driving CRPC progression is most
clearly demonstrated by the survival benefit conferred by abiraterone acetate, a drug which
blocks androgen synthesis by inhibiting 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17A1), and
enzalutamide, a potent AR antagonist that blocks DHT access to the AR ligand-binding
domain (Barrie et al., 1994; de Bono et al., 2011; Scher et al., 2012; Tran et al., 2009).
Intratumoral synthesis of DHT from precursors that are secreted from the adrenal gland
occurs through a pathway that circumvents T (Chang et al., 2011). This synthesis requires
three enzymes: 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD; encoded by HSD3B), steroid-5αreductase (SRD5A) and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17βHSD) isoenzymes (see Fig
1A) (Chang et al., 2011; Knudsen and Penning, 2010). Nonetheless, increased DHT
synthesis in CRPC has not yet been ascribed to any mutations in genes encoding
components of the steroidogenic machinery. 3βHSD oxidizes 3β-hydroxyl to 3-keto and
isomerizes Δ5 to Δ4 (see Fig 1A), reactions that together make this step practically
irreversible by an enzyme that is required for all possible pathways that lead to the synthesis
of DHT (Evaul et al., 2010). HSD3B1 encodes for the peripherally expressed isoenzyme
(3βHSD1) and has a germline single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position 1245 of
HSD3B1, converting A → C, which exchanges an asparagine (N) for a threonine (T) at
3βHSD1 amino acid position 367.

Here, we show that CRPC sometimes expresses the 367T form of 3βHSD1
(3βHSD1(367T)), which increases metabolic flux from dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) via
the 5α-androstanedione (5α-dione) pathway to DHT by protein resistance to ubiquitination
and degradation rather than increased catalytic activity. Selection for 3βHSD1(367T) is
evident from somatic mutation in human CRPC tumors, by loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) of
the wild-type copy in patients with germline heterozygous inheritance and from the
generation and expression of the same somatic mutation occurring in a mouse xenograft
model treated with abiraterone acetate.

Results
Cells with 3βHSD1(367T) have increased flux to DHT
Conversion of DHEA by 3βHSD1 to Δ4-androstenedione (AD) is a proximal step in
peripheral tissues for metabolism from adrenal precursors to DHT (Lorence et al., 1990;
Simard et al., 2005). Two cell lines derived from patients with CRPC have widely disparate
flux from DHEA to AD (Fig 1A), despite comparable expression of transcripts encoding
both 3βHSD1 and 3βHSD2 (Fig S1A). Under the same conditions, LNCaP cells metabolize
> 90% of [3H]-DHEA by 3βHSD enzymatic activity to AD after 48 hours, whereas LAPC4
cells metabolize only approximately 10% of [3H]-DHEA. In LAPC4 but not LNCaP,
apparent rate-limiting conversion of DHEA to AD en route to DHT via the dominant
pathway (DHEA → AD → 5α-dione → DHT) (Chang et al., 2011) is further evident by
limited accumulation of downstream metabolites and absence of DHEA concentrationCell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2014 August 29.

dependent increases in AR-regulated PSA and TMPRSS2 (Fig 1B). Sequencing the exons of
both HSD3B isoenzymes reveals a single nonsynonymous substitution (Fig 1C) at position
1245 of HSD3B1, converting A → C and exchanges an asparagine (N) for a threonine (T) at
3βHSD1 amino acid position 367 in LNCaP but not LAPC4. To further test the association
between HSD3B1 sequence and steroid metabolism, other human prostate cell lines were
investigated. Presence of wild-type (1245A) and variant (1245C) HSD3B1 sequence in other
prostate cancer and immortalized prostate cell lines is also concordant with “slow” and
“fast” flux from DHEA to AD, respectively (Fig S1B). The kinetic properties of
recombinant 3βHSD1(367N) and 3βHSD1(367T) proteins, however, do not explain the
differences in steroid metabolism between cells expressing each protein (Fig 1D). Western
blot was performed to determine if the allele encoding 3βHSD1(367T) is associated with a
greater amount of protein in these cells. Both models that encode for 3βHSD1(367T) have
increased 3βHSD1 protein compared with the models that have wild-type sequence (Fig
1E).
Androgen deprivation selects for HSD3B1 (1245C)

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The HSD3B1(1245C); 3βHSD1(367T) allele occurs as a germline SNP variant (rs1047303;
22% allele frequency) (Shimodaira et al., 2010) but might also occur as a somatic mutation
in prostate cancer. Although germline homozygous HSD3B1(1245C) inheritance cannot be
ruled out, the most likely scenarios accounting for the sole presence of the HSD3B1(1245C)
allele evident in both LNCaP and VCaP, given the low expected frequency of homozygous
HSD3B1(1245C) inheritance, are either germline heterozygous inheritance followed by lossof-heterozygosity (LOH) of the wild-type allele, or germline homozygous wild-type
inheritance followed by somatic mutation of 1245 A → C. To identify the existence of these
possible mechanisms of HSD3B1(1245C) selection in human tumors, matching germline
and tumor DNA were sequenced from men with CRPC. Genomic DNA was isolated from
CRPC and normal tissue from patients treated at the University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center (UTSW) and from the University of Washington (UW) rapid autopsy
program (Montgomery et al., 2008). Patient and tumor characteristics are available in Table
S1. Of 40 men with CRPC, the germline of 25, 11 and 4 individuals are homozygous wildtype HSD3B1(1245A), heterozygous and homozygous variant HSD3B1(1245C),
respectively. Three of 25 (12%) CRPC tumors with homozygous HSD3B1(1245A)
inheritance have acquired the HSD3B1(1245C) allele (Fig 2A). Expression of
HSD3B1(1245C) transcript was confirmed in the one available fresh-frozen tumor. It is
highly likely that the observation of 3 identical de novo mutations occurring in 25 patients is
due to selection rather than chance alone, with a high degree of statistical significance
(p=1.47 × 10−13), using the binomial method and assuming a mutation rate of 4 per
1,000,000 base pairs (Greenman et al., 2007). Of 11 CRPC tumors with heterozygous
inheritance, 3 (27%) have LOH of the HSD3B1(1245A) allele, resulting in the
HSD3B1(1245C) allele being predominantly detectable (Fig 2B). In these three tumors,
LOH of adjacent heterozygous SNPs further confirms loss of this region of chromosome 1.
In contrast, none of the 11 cases with heterozygous inheritance exhibited LOH of the
HSD3B1(1245C) allele (Fig S2A).
Two tumors (UW9 and UW25) with LOH of the HSD3B1(1245A) allele had tissue
remaining for additional studies. Consistent with the findings in LNCaP and VCaP that only
have the HSD3B1(1245C) allele, both of these tumors have abundant detectable 3βHSD1
protein (Fig 2C). In contrast, both tumors tested with heterozygous expression and
homozygous HSD3B1(1245A) expression have little or no detectable 3βHSD1. mRNA
quantitation by qPCR demonstrates that the increased 3βHSD1 protein abundance occurring
specifically in the tumors with LOH is not attributable to transcript overexpression (Fig

S2B). Both tumors with LOH robustly express AR and PSA, suggesting that flux to DHT
sustained by 3βHSD1 protein functions to elicit AR signaling (Fig 2C).

Abiraterone inhibits CYP17A1 and weakly inhibits 3βHSD, further decreasing intratumoral
androgen concentrations and extending survival in CRPC (de Bono et al., 2011; Li et al.,
2012); therefore, conversion to the HSD3B1(1245C) allele encoding 3βHSD1(367T) might
permit sustained androgen synthesis despite lower availability of precursors. To determine if
abiraterone treatment selects for the HSD3B1(1245C) allele, genomic DNA from LAPC4
xenograft tumors grown in orchiectomized mice treated with abiraterone or vehicle (n=8
mice per treatment) was isolated and sequenced (Li et al., 2012). The 1245C allele is
detectable in 2 of 8 tumors (Abi #1 and Abi #2) in the abiraterone treatment group and no
tumors in the vehicle group (Fig 2D). To confirm expression of the somatically acquired
mutation in the abiraterone group, cDNA clones were generated and sequenced. The mutant
HSD3B1(1245C) transcript encoding for 3βHSD1(367T) is confirmed in 12 of 21(57%)
cDNA clones sequenced from Abi #1 and 7 of 26 (27%) clones from Abi #2. In contrast, the
mutant transcript is not present in any of the 37 cDNA clones obtained from two vehicle
treated LAPC4 xenograft tumors.
Blocking 3βHSD1(367T) inhibits DHT synthesis, the AR-response and CRPC

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine the role of 3βHSD1(367T) expression in regulating flux from DHEA to DHT
and AR stimulation, endogenous expression was silenced in LNCaP using 2 independent
lentiviral shRNAs (Fig 3A). Blocking 3βHSD1 expression with both shRNAs inhibits flux
from DHEA to AD, resulting in little or no detectable conversion to downstream 5α-dione
and DHT (Fig 3B). Silencing mutant 3βHSD1 expression and blocking flux to DHT
impedes the expression of AR-regulated PSA and TMPRSS2 (Fig 3C), leading to inhibition
of cell proliferation in vitro (Fig 3D). In vivo, depletion of endogenously expressed mutant
3βHSD1 significantly hinders CRPC growth in surgically orchiectomized mice (Fig 3E).
CRPC tumors that eventually develop from cell lines initially expressing lentiviral shRNA
knockdown constructs regain 3βHSD1 protein, probably from selection for cells that have
lost the shRNA construct (Fig 3F).
3βHSD1(367T) is resistant to ubiquitination and degradation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Endogenous expression of 3βHSD1(367T) appears to engender increased protein abundance
compared to 3βHSD1(367N) expression (Fig 1E). To determine if the underlying
mechanism is due to an alteration in protein degradation, wild-type (HSD3B1(N)-HA) and
(HSD3B1(T)-HA) constructs were generated and transiently expressed, and protein levels
were compared following inhibition of translation with cycloheximide (CHX) treatment.
The 367 N → T mutation substantially increases protein half-life from 2.1 hours to 27 hours
(Fig 4A). Similar experiments with an alternative prostate cancer cell line (Fig S3A) and
with stable expression of lentiviral constructs confirm the longer half-life of 3βHSD1(367T)
(Fig S3B). To determine whether increased degradation of wild-type protein is reversible
with proteasome inhibition, cells were treated with MG132. Pharmacologic proteasome
inhibition increases endogenous wild-type 3βHSD1(367N) in LAPC4 but not
3βHSD1(367T) in LNCaP (Fig 4B) and polyubiquitinated endogenous 3βHSD1(367N)
accumulates with MG132 treatment in LAPC4 (Fig 4C). In contrast, polyubiquitinated
endogenous 3βHSD1(367T) is not increased in LNCaP with MG132 treatment (Fig S3C). A
direct comparison of ubiquitination between HA-tagged wild-type and mutant protein by Niagarose pull down demonstrates that 3βHSD1(367T) is resistant to polyubiquitination (Fig
4D), explaining decreased vulnerability to proteasome-mediated degradation and longer
protein half-life.

AMFR binds 3βHSD1(367N) and is required for ubiquitination

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We employed mass spectrometry to determine the lysine residue(s) ubiquitinated on
3βHSD1(367N). Ubiquitination is detectable on both K70 (Fig 5A) and K352 (Fig 5B) of
3βHSD1(367N). The effects of K352R and K70R single mutations and a double mutation on
ubiquitination were assessed by Ni-agarose pull down (Fig 5C). K352 appears to be a more
critical site of ubiquitination than K70, and mutation of both sites decreases ubiquitination
greater than either mutation alone. AMFR (autocrine mobility factor receptor, also known as
gp78) is a membrane-anchored ubiquitin ligase that functions through the endoplasmic
reticulum associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway (Song et al., 2005). Eeyarestatin
I (EerI) is a small molecule that inhibits protein degradation through the ERAD pathway
(Wang et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2009). Endogenous 3βHSD1(367N) protein increases in
LAPC4 cells with EerI treatment, suggesting that the ERAD pathway is required for
3βHSD1(367N) degradation (Fig 5D). Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture
(SILAC) coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry was employed to identify
candidate ubiquitin ligases in an unbiased manner that preferentially associate with
3βHSD1(367N) (Ong et al., 2002). In this experiment, cells expressing 3βHSD1(367T)-HA
and 3βHSD1(367N)-HA were grown in light and heavy media, respectively. AMFR was
detected with a normalized protein ratio of 1.67 (derived from peptide ratios varying ≤17%)
in a mixture of 3βHSD1(367N)-HA and 3βHSD1(367T)-HA immunoprecipitations mixed in
a 1:1 ratio, indicating preferential physical association with 3βHSD1(367N) protein.
Immunoprecipitation of 3βHSD1(367N)-HA and 3βHSD1(367T)-HA, followed by AMFR
immunoblot confirms a preferential physical association of AMFR with 3βHSD1(367N)
protein (Fig 5E). To assess the functional consequence of this interaction, AMFR was
silenced using siRNA (Fig 5F). AMFR knockdown increases the abundance of 3βHSD1
protein, demonstrating the requirement of AMFR for 3βHSD1 degradation through the
ERAD pathway. In contrast, silencing the alternative ubiquitin ligase SKP2 by siRNA has
no detectable effect on 3βHSD1.
3βHSD1(367T) increases DHT synthesis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine if resistance to protein ubiquitination and degradation ascribed to
3βHSD1(367T) confers increased synthesis of DHT from precursor steroids, we expressed
constructs that encode for 3βHSD1(367N), 3βHSD1(367T), or vector alone in LAPC4 cells,
and assessed metabolic flux from [3H]-DHEA to downstream steroids. LAPC4 cells
transiently transfected with the construct encoding for 3βHSD1(367T) exhibit increased flux
from DHEA → AD → 5α-dione → DHT (Fig 6A). Equivalent expression of both
transcripts was confirmed by qPCR (Fig 6B). Stable lentiviral expression of 3βHSD1(367T)
similarly confers increased flux from DHEA → AD → 5α-dione → DHT (Fig 6C) with
transcript expression comparable to wild-type (Fig 6D). Finally, we determined that the
3βHSD1(367T) phenotype that accelerates flux from DHEA to DHT amplifies the response
of androgen-regulated gene expression (Fig 6E) and hastens the time to the development of
CRPC xenograft tumors (Fig 6F) in orchiectomized mice supplemented with DHEA to
mimic human adrenal physiology. 3βHSD1(367T) tumors express higher levels of PSA
transcript compared to 3βHSD1(367N) tumors, suggesting the presence of higher sustained
DHT concentrations generated in 3βHSD1(367T) tumors (Fig 6G). Together, these findings
support a mechanism favoring genetic selection for the allele encoding 3βHSD1(367T) in
the setting of androgen depletion.

Discussion
A major mechanism of resistance to frontline gonadal T depletion (or castration) therapy is
an acquired metabolic capability, which allows CRPC tumors to sustain sufficient DHT
concentrations for AR stimulation and tumor progression. This study is the first to identify a

gain-of-function mutation in the steroidogenic machinery that increases flux to DHT.
Notably, whether utilizing the major adrenal pathway or possibly de novo steroidogenesis
from cholesterol, 3β-hydroxl oxidation to 3-keto and Δ5→4 isomerization by 3βHSD
enzymatic activity is required for all pathways culminating in T and/or DHT synthesis
(Evaul et al., 2010). Adrenal DHEA and DHEA-sulfate are typically present in abundant
concentrations in human serum. In the context of intratumoral 3βHSD1(367N) expression,
the clinical response to gonadal T depletion probably occurs in part due to the limited
contribution of adrenal precursors to intratumoral DHT. Augmented 3βHSD activity
occurring through increased protein abundance with 3βHSD1(367T) would therefore serve
to open the floodgates on a proximal and otherwise rate-limiting step for the synthesis of
DHT, resulting in the development of CRPC. Notably, in the setting of heterozygous
inheritance, 3βHSD1 protein expression is markedly higher in tumors that have lost the
wild-type HSD3B1(1245A) allele compared to tumors that retain the wild-type sequence
(Fig 2C). This finding might occur because expression and co-localization of the wild-type
3βHSD1(367N) protein reinstates mutant 3βHSD1(367T) ubiquitination and subsequent
degradation via dimerization or oligomerization. Nonetheless, engineered 3βHSD1(367T)
expression engenders increased flux to DHT and development of CRPC despite endogenous
3βHSD1(367N) expression (Fig 6). Therefore, the transition from sole 3βHSD1(367N)
expression to mixed expression to dominant 3βHSD1(367T) expression probably represents
a stepwise selection for an increased capacity for DHT synthesis.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The population frequency of the HSD3B1(1245C) allele is approximately 22% but appears
to vary widely by ethnicity (UCSC). Other studies suggest that the HSD3B1(1245C) allele
may raise aldosterone levels and increase the risk of essential hypertension (Shimodaira et
al., 2010). This is probably attributable to increased 3βHSD enzyme activity, which is
required for aldosterone synthesis, although aldosterone is generally thought to require
3βHSD2. Interestingly, this phenotype appears to be more severe with homozygous
HSD3B1(1245C). The observation of extremely high aldosterone with homozygous
HSD3B1(1245C) is consistent with higher enzymatic activity and stepwise selection for sole
3βHSD1(367T) expression that occurs in CRPC. HSD3B1(1245C) has no consistent effect
on risk of localized prostate cancer (Chang et al., 2002; Cunningham et al., 2007; Thomas et
al., 2008).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although abiraterone potently inhibits androgen synthesis, clinical studies of urinary
androgen metabolites in patients with CRPC treated with this drug have demonstrated that
the block is incomplete and that the synthesis of residual androgen precursors persists
(Attard et al., 2012). This finding raises the possibility that tumor mechanisms that augment
androgen synthesis from limited precursor steroids by increasing flux to DHT might
contribute to abiraterone resistance (Chang and Sharifi, 2012). Our data demonstrating the
selection and expression of 3βHSD1(367T) in a xenograft model of abiraterone resistance
suggest a genetic mechanism for clinical resistance to abiraterone and that pharmacologic
inhibition of 3βHSD1 might be a viable therapeutic strategy to overcome this resistance
against tumors expressing the mutant enzyme. Despite the potent activity of the AR
antagonist enzalutamide, its affinity for the ligand-binding domain of AR is lower than the
affinity of DHT (Tran et al., 2009). Increased metabolic flux from steroid precursors to DHT
by 3βHSD1(367T) may therefore conceivably tip the scales in the favor of DHT and lead to
enzalutamide resistance as well. The contribution of 3βHSD1(367T) in clinical resistance to
abiraterone and enzalutamide, however, remain to be determined.
The past decade has brought to the fore the development of molecularly targeted therapies
that are matched to specific disease-driving enzyme mutations present in a given patient.
These advances come mainly in the form of tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target gain-offunction mutations in these signaling enzymes. These include the examples of EGF receptor

inhibitors matched with tumors harboring mutant EGF receptor in non-small cell lung
cancer and BRAF inhibitors for melanomas that are driven by BRAF mutations (Chapman et
al., 2011; Kobayashi et al., 2005; Lynch et al., 2004). In contrast, no examples of drug
targeting based on enzyme mutations exist in the standard of care for metastatic CRPC.
While our demonstration is in a gain-of-function in a metabolic enzyme, rather than a
signaling enzyme, we believe the underlying principle is the same, and our findings expose
the opportunity for matching a mutant disease-driving enzyme biomarker with its cognate
pharmacologic inhibitor.

Experimental Procedures
Steroid Metabolism Experiments

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Steroid metabolism experiments were performed 12 hours after seeding cells by treatment
with 1 mL serum-free medium containing [3H]-labeled DHEA (100 nM, 300,000-600,000
cpm; PerkinElmer). Aliquots of medium were collected for up to 48 hours, treated with βglucuronidase (1000 units; Sigma-Aldrich) at 65°C for 4 hours. Deconjugated steroids were
extracted, evaporated under nitrogen stream, dissolved in 50% methanol, injected on a
Breeze 1525 system equipped with model 717 plus autoinjector (Waters Corp.) and steroid
metabolites were separated on a Luna 150 × 3 mm, 3.0 μM C18 reverse-phase column
(Phenomenex). The column effluent was mixed with Liquiscint scintillation cocktail
(National Diagnostics) and analyzed by a β-RAM model 3 in-line radioactivity detector (IN/
US Systems). Steroid metabolism experiments with transient enzyme expression were
performed with pCMV5-HSD3B1 (367N and 367T) constructs 24 hours after transfection
and 12 hours after treatment with 25 μM cycloheximide (CHX). Steroid metabolism
experiments with stable enzyme expression were performed after lentiviral infection with
pLVX-Tight-Puro vector. Human tissues were obtained using IRB approved protocols at UT
Southwestern and the University of Washington rapid autopsy program. Lentiviral
constructs were made from miR30-styled shRNA sequences and cloned into the pGIPZ
vector and infected cells expressing the constructs were selected with 2 μg/mL puromycin.
Gene expression was performed by qPCR using the iTaq SYBR Green Supermix with the
ROX kit (Bio-Rad) in an ABI-7500 Real-Time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems). Protein
half-life was determined after transient transfection with pCMX-HSD3B1-HA (367N and
367T) plasmids, followed in 24 hours with 25 μM CHX in serum-free medium containing
100 nM DHEA. Cells stably expressing HA-tagged HSD3B1 (367N and 367T) in pLVXTight-Puro were used to determine protein half-life 24 hours after induction of protein
expression with 2 ng/mL doxycycline and treatment with CHX.

The 3βHSD1(367T) protein encoded by mutant HSD3B1(1245C) increases flux from DHEA
to AD, which is otherwise rate-limiting, en route to DHT and expression of AR-responsive
genes. (A) Metabolic flux from [3H]-DHEA (100 nM) to AD and downstream to 5α-dione
and DHT is robust in LNCaP but limited in LAPC4. The metabolic pathway and steroid
structures are shown, indicating sites of modification by 3βHSD1 in converting DHEA to
AD. Steroids were quantitated at the indicated time points by HPLC. (B) DHEA induces
PSA and TMPRSS2 expression in a concentration-dependent manner in LNCaP but not
LAPC4. Expression was assessed by qPCR and normalized to RPLP0 and vehicle control.

Somatic selection for HSD3B1(1245C) encoding 3βHSD1(367T) occurs with resistance to
androgen deprivation. (A) Conversion from A → C in HSD3B1 occurs in 3 CRPC tumors
from patients with homozygous wild-type inheritance. Sequence of cDNA clones from a
fresh-frozen tumor (UTSW7) confirms expression of HSD3B1(1245C) transcript. (B) Three
CRPC tumors from patients with heterozygous inheritance exhibit LOH of the wild-type
HSD3B1(1245A) allele. Sequencing informative (heterozygous) adjacent 5’ (rs6203) and 3’
(rs34814922 and rs113096733) SNPs confirms LOH. (C) 3βHSD1 protein is abundant in
tumors with LOH of the HSD3B1(1245A) allele but not tumors with heterozygous

expression or homozygous HSD3B1(1245A) expression. Both tumors with LOH tested also
express AR and PSA (20 μg protein loaded per lane for each tumor). (D) Somatic mutation
converting A → C in HSD3B1 occurs in two LAPC4 xenograft tumors treated with
abiraterone acetate (Abi) after orchiectomy and expression of HSD3B1(1245C) transcript
encoding 3βHSD1(367T) is evidenced by sequencing cDNA clones from these tumors.
Genomic sequence from two representative control tumors (CTRL#1 and CTRL#2) treated
with orchiectomy alone is shown for comparison. All 37 cDNA clones from CTRL#1 and

Genetic silencing of 3βHSD1(367T) impedes conversion of DHEA to DHT, induction of
PSA and TMPRSS2 expression, and CRPC growth. (A) Stable lentiviral expression of two
independent shRNA constructs against HSD3B1 (shHSD3B1 #1 and shHSD3B1 #2)
silences 3βHSD1 protein expression in LNCaP. The 3βHSD1 protein was quantitated and
normalized to cells expressing nonsilencing lentiviral vector (shCTRL) and β-actin. (B)
Silencing 3βHSD1(367T) blocks flux from [3H]-DHEA (100 nM) to AD as well as further
downstream conversion to 5α-dione and DHT. Cells were treated with [3H]-DHEA in
triplicate and steroids were quantitated with HPLC at the designated time points. (C)

DHEA for 24 hours, and gene expression was assessed by qPCR and normalized to
shCTRL-infected cells treated with vehicle and the RPLP0 housekeeping gene. (D)
Silencing 3βHSD1(367T) inhibits in vitro growth. Cells were grown in the presence of 20
nM DHEA or vehicle and growth for each cell line is normalized to vehicle for each
designated day. (E) 3βHSD1(367T) depletion blocks CRPC growth in LNCaP xenografts.
Mice underwent surgical orchiectomy and DHEA pellet implantation concomitantly when
xenograft tumors reached a threshold volume of 100 mm3. Fifteen mice were initiated in
each cohort, 7, 8 and 10 mice in shCTRL, shHSD3B1 #1, and shHSD3B1 #2 groups,
respectively, achieved a tumor volume of 100 mm3 in eugonadal mice, underwent
orchiectomy and were included in the CRPC analysis. The number of days from
orchiectomy to tumor volume ≥ 600 mm3 is shown. In the comparisons of shCTRL vs
shHSD3B1 #1 and shHSD3B1 #2, P = 0.002 and 0.003, respectively, using a log rank test.
(F) 3βHSD1(367T) protein is regained in CRPC tumors that grow from LNCaP expressing
shHSD3B1 #1 and shHSD3B1 #2. Immunoblot for 3βHSD1 and β-actin were performed on
protein from the indicated LNCaP CRPC tumors. Error bars in B, C and D represent the SD
for experiments performed in triplicate.

Resistance to ubiquitination and proteosome-mediated degradation occurs with
3βHSD1(367T) which results in prolonged protein half-life. (A) 3βHSD1(367T) persists
after inhibition of protein translation. LAPC4 cells were transiently transfected with
constructs encoding for wild-type (N-HA) and (T-HA) protein and treated with
cycloheximide (CHX) for the designated incubation times. Western blot with anti-HA
antibody was performed, and signal was quantitated and normalized to time zero and βactin. (B) Treatment with MG132 (10 μM; 8 hours) reverses 3βHSD1(367N) protein loss in
LAPC4 and results in no 3βHSD1(367T) protein increase in LNCaP. (C) Proteosome
inhibition with MG132 (10 μM; 8 hours) results in an increase in polyubiquitinated
3βHSD1(367N) protein in LAPC4 as evidenced by immunoprecipitation with an antiubiquitin antibody. (D) Loss of 3βHSD1(367T) vulnerability to proteosome-mediated
degradation is explained by diminished susceptibility to ubiquitination. His-ubiquitin (Hisubi) was expressed with wild-type (N-HA) or (T-HA) protein in 293 cells, followed by pull
down with Ni-agarose beads and anti-HA immunoblot.

with His-ubi in 293 cells, followed by pull down with Ni-agarose beads and anti-HA
immunoblot. (D) Treatment with the ERAD inhibitor, Eeyarestatin I (EerI, 10μM), increases
endogenous 3βHSD1 protein in LAPC4. (E) AMFR preferentially physically associates with

3βHSD1(367T) increases metabolic flux from DHEA to DHT and elicits CRPC. (A)
Transient expression of 3βHSD1(367T) (T, blue bars) leads to increased conversion from
DHEA to AD and downstream steroids compared with 3βHSD1(367N) (N, red bars).
LAPC4 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid, treated with CHX, and cultured
with [3H]-DHEA (100 nM); steroids were extracted and measured by HPLC at the
designated time points (p-value = 0.023 for the difference in DHT synthesis by the N and T
forms using by Student's t-test). (B) Transient transfection results in equivalent expression
of both transcripts by qPCR. (C) Stable expression demonstrates increased activity of
3βHSD1(367T). Lentiviral constructs expressing luciferase (L), wild-type (N), or (T), were
stably expressed (without CHX treatment) and flux from [3H]-DHEA to DHT was assessed,
as described previously (p-value = 0.015 for the difference in DHT synthesis by the N and T
forms using Student's t-test). (D) Expression of both enzyme transcripts by qPCR is
comparable. (E) Increased flux from DHEA to DHT with stable expression of
3βHSD1(367T) leads to amplified expression of PSA in LAPC4. Cells stably expressing the
designated constructs were treated with the indicated steroids for 48 hours. PSA expression
induced by the DHT positive control is equivalent among the three cell populations. For B,
D and E, expression is normalized to RPLP0 and vector, luciferase, or vehicle controls.
Error bars represent the SD for experiments performed in triplicate. (F) Development of
CRPC occurs more rapidly in LAPC4 xenografts stably expressing 3βHSD1(367T) as
compared with 3βHSD1(367N). Time from subcutaneous injection of cells in each flank to
tumor size = 50 mm3 is shown for each tumor that developed in a mouse flank (n = 40
mouse flanks in each group). P=0.017 for the comparison using a log rank test. (G) PSA
