Abstract
The centrality of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) in cancer etiology is well established, but clinical
translation of PI3K inhibitors has been limited by feedback signaling, suboptimal intratumoral concentration,
and an insulin resistance "class effect." This study was designed to explore the use of supramolecular
nanochemistry for targeting PI3K to enhance antitumor efﬁcacy and potentially overcome these limitations.
PI3K inhibitor structures were rationally modiﬁed using a cholesterol-based derivative, facilitating supramolecular nanoassembly with L-a-phosphatidylcholine and DSPE-PEG [1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino(polythylene glycol)]. The supramolecular nanoparticles (SNP) that were assembled were physicochemically characterized and functionally evaluated in vitro. Antitumor efﬁcacy was
quantiﬁed in vivo using 4T1 breast cancer and K-RasLSL/þ/Ptenﬂ/ﬂ ovarian cancer models, with effects on
glucose homeostasis evaluated using an insulin sensitivity test. The use of PI103 and PI828 as surrogate
molecules to engineer the SNPs highlighted the need to keep design principles in perspective; speciﬁcally,
potency of the active molecule and the linker chemistry were critical principles for efﬁcacy, similar to
antibody–drug conjugates. We found that the SNPs exerted a temporally sustained inhibition of phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, S6K, and 4EBP in vivo. These effects were associated with increased antitumor efﬁcacy
and survival as compared with PI103 and PI828. Efﬁcacy was further increased by decorating the nanoparticle
surface with tumor-homing peptides. Notably, the use of SNPs abrogated the insulin resistance that has been
associated widely with other PI3K inhibitors. This study provides a preclinical foundation for the use of
supramolecular nanochemistry to overcome current challenges associated with PI3K inhibitors, offering a
paradigm for extension to other molecularly targeted therapeutics being explored for cancer treatment.

Introduction
According to the World Health Organization, mortality due
to cancer is expected to increase from 7.6 million in 2008 to 12
million deaths in 2030 (1). To address this growing problem,
two emerging paradigms driving the evolution of newer treatment strategies are as follows: (i) better understanding of
oncogenic drivers, leading to the development of molecularly
"targeted" therapeutics (2, 3), and (ii) the use of nanotechnology to deliver cytotoxic drugs speciﬁcally to the tumor, resulting in improved therapeutic index (4, 5). However, the interface
between these two paradigms, which can offer unique opportunities for improving chemotherapeutic outcomes, currently
remains largely underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate
the potential advantages of bringing these two paradigms
together through the rational design of supramolecular nanoparticles (SNP) that target the phosphoinositide-3-kinase
(PI3K) pathway.
The centrality of the PI3K family of lipid kinases in the
etiology of cancer is well established (6). Of the 3 classes of

PI3K, class IA PI3K is most implicated in driving human
cancers (7). PIK3CA and PIK3R1, which encode the p110a
catalytic subunit and the regulatory p85a subunit of PI3K,
respectively, are somatically mutated or ampliﬁed in multiple
primary cancers, including of breast and ovarian origins
(7). Similarly, the lipid phosphatase PTEN, an inhibitor of
PI3K signaling, is a commonly inactivated tumor suppressor
(8). Activation of this pathway can also occur upstream at the
level of mutated or ampliﬁed tyrosine receptor kinase or
downstream through mutations of AKT and RAS (7). Consequently, small-molecule inhibitors that target PI3K pathway have emerged as an exciting area of research, and several
molecules that either inhibit speciﬁc catalytic subunits (a, b,
d, and g) of p110 or act as pan-PI3K inhibitors are currently
in development (9). However, recent studies have implicated
p110a as also playing a predominant role in glucose homeostasis (10). Indeed, recent data from a phase I clinical study
with a pan-class I selective PI3K inhibitor (NVP-BKM120)
showed dose-dependent hyperglycemia, possibly an example
of a class effect consistent with PI3K inhibition (11). Furthermore, studies have reported that approximately 10-fold
higher concentration of PI3K inhibitors might be required
to block phosphorylation of downstream pathway proteins
(such as ribosomal protein S6) than that needed for inhibiting more proximal AKT phosphorylation (12). We rationalized that a natural approach to overcome these challenges
associated with targeting the PI3K pathway is through the
use of nanotechnology.
Nanovectors capitalize on the unique leaky angiogenic tumor vasculature to preferentially home to tumors,
which coupled with impaired lymphatic drainage results
in increased intratumoral drug concentrations (termed as
the enhanced permeation and retention or EPR effect;
ref. 13). However, traditional processes for nanoformulation are often incompatible with physicochemical properties of many chemotherapeutic agents, which can limit
the entrapment efﬁciency or introduce suboptimal release kinetics. Indeed, our early attempts in entrapping
LY294002, one of the earliest PI3K inhibitors, resulted in
suboptimal loading efﬁciency that prevented translation to
in vivo tumor efﬁcacy studies (14). Similarly, in a recent
study, wortmannin-encapsulated polymeric nanoparticles
were shown to act as a radiosensitizer (15), but such
formulations are limited by burst release, which complicate clinical translation. We rationalized that this can be
addressed using supramolecular nanochemistry (16), i.e.,
evolution of complex nanostructures from molecular
building blocks interacting via noncovalent intermolecular
force (17, 18). Indeed, supramolecular nanochemistry is an
emerging concept in cancer theranostics; for example, in a
recent study, gandolinium (III)-encapsulated SNPs were
used in diagnosis of cancer metastasis (19). Here, we report
that rational modiﬁcation of PI3K inhibitors facilitates
supramolecular assembly in the nanoscale dimension.
Such PI3K-targeting SNPs exhibit the desired pharmacodynamic proﬁle with enhanced antitumor efﬁcacy, and can
emerge as a new paradigm in targeted molecular therapeutics development.

H spectra were recorded on Bruker DPX 400 MHz spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported in d (ppm) units using
residual 1H signals from deuterated solvents as references.
Spectra were analyzed with Mest-Re-C Lite (Mestrelab
Research) and/or XWinPlot (Bruker Biospin) softwares. Electrospray ionization mass spectra were recorded on a Micromass Q Tof 2 (Waters) and data were analyzed with MassLynx
4.0 software (Waters). The, 4T1 and MDA-MB-231s cell lines
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and
used within 6 months of resuscitation of frozen stock.
Synthesis of PI103–cholesterol conjugate
Cholesterol (500 mg, 1.29 mmol) was dissolved in 5 mL of
anhydrous pyridine. Succinic anhydride (645 mg, 6.45 mmol)
and catalytic amount of DMAP was added to the reaction
mixture to form a clear solution. The reaction mixture was
stirred under argon atmosphere for 12 hours. Pyridine was then
removed under vacuum and the crude residue was diluted in
30 mL DCM. It was washed with 1N HCl (30 mL) and water
(30 mL), and the organic layer was separated and dried over
anhydrous sodium sulfate, ﬁltered, and concentrated in vacuo.
Completion of the reaction was conﬁrmed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) in 1:99 methanol:DCM solvent mixtures.
PI103 (25 mg, 0.072 mmol) was dissolved in 3 mL anhydrous
DCM followed by addition of cholesterol–succinic acid (0.216

mmol, 26 mg). The reaction mixture was stirred at room
temperature for 12 hours under argon. Upon completion of
reaction as monitored by TLC, the reaction mixture was diluted
with 10 mL DCM and washed with dilute HCl and water. The
organic layers were separated, combined, and dried over
anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated under
vacuum and the crude product was puriﬁed by using column

Synthesis and characterization of SNPs
Drug–cholesterol conjugates, L-a-phosphatidylcholine, and
DSPE-PEG2000 (at optimized weight ratios) were dissolved in
1.0 mL DCM. Resulting solutions were evaporated in a roundbottomed ﬂask with the help of a rotary evaporator and
thoroughly dried. The resulting thin ﬁlms were hydrated with
PBS with constant rotation at 55 C for 2 hours. Nanoparticles
were eluted through a Sephadex column and extruded through
200 nm pores. The size was checked using dynamic light
scattering (DLS), and drug loading was determined by spectroscopy. For release kinetics studies, the drug-loaded nanoparticles (1 mg drug/mL; 5 mL) were suspended in PBS buffer
(pH 7.4), 4T1 or 4306 cell lysates within a dialysis tube (MWCO
¼ 3,500 Da; Spectrum Lab). The dialysis tube was suspended in
1 L PBS pH 7.4 with gentle stirring to simulate inﬁnite sink tank
condition. A 100 mL portion of the aliquot was collected from
the sample at predetermined time intervals and replaced by
equal volume of PBS buffer, and the released drug was quantiﬁed by spectrometry. More details are available in Supplementary Data.
In vitro assays
The 4T1 and MDA MB 468 breast cancer cells were cultured in RPMI, whereas 4306 ovarian cancer cells were cultured
in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (supplemented with
10% FBS and 1% of antibiotic–antimycotic 100 solution).
Cells (4  103) were seeded into 96-well ﬂat-bottomed plates,
and incubated with free drug or drug-loaded nanoparticles
(normalized to equivalent amounts of free drug) for desired
time periods. Cell viability was quantiﬁed using the CellTiter
96 Aqueous One Solution assay (Promega). To study drug
internalization, 4T1 breast cancer cells were incubated with
free PI103 or PI103-SNPs (with equivalent amount of PI103) for
4 hours, then washed and incubated in fresh media. After
desired time of incubation, cells were lysed, and drug concentrations quantiﬁed using spectroscopy.
Murine 4T1 breast cancer model
The 4T1 breast cancer cells (1  106) were implanted subcutaneously in the ﬂanks of 4-week-old BALB/c mice. The drug
therapy was started on day 9. Animals were randomized into
the following treatment groups: (i) vehicle, (ii) free drug
(5 mg/kg), and (iii) SNPs (at dose equivalent to 5 mg/kg of
the PI3K inhibitor). In a separate experiment, we included
an additional group treated with iRGD-PI103-SNPs to test for

effect of active targeting on efﬁcacy. Animals were dosed every
48 hours. The tumors were measured regularly, tumor volume
(Vt) was calculated using the formula, L  B2 =2, and relative
tumor volume was calculated using the formula Vt =V0 (where
V0 was tumor volume at the time of ﬁrst injection). In a separate
study, we monitored survival of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice and
treatments were performed as described above. Animals (n ¼ 10
in each group) were sacriﬁced as soon as they reached moribund
state, which is attained before reaching tumor volume cutoff in
this model. All animal procedures were approved by the Harvard
Institutional Use and Care of Animals Committee.
Insulin tolerance test using PI103-SNPs
Random fed mice (with 4T1 breast cancer) were injected
with a single dose of empty nanoparticles (control), free PI103
or PI828 and PI828-SNP or PI103-SNPs (at doses equivalent to
5 mg/kg of the parent inhibitor molecule) via the tail vein. The
mice were injected with freshly prepared insulin solution (0.75
U/kg) in 0.1 mL 0.9% NaCl at deﬁned time points after drug
administration. Blood glucose levels were measured before and
45 minutes after insulin injections using a glucometer.
Efﬁcacy study of PI103-SNPs in murine ovarian cancer
tumor model
Ovarian adenocarcinomas were induced in genetically engineered K-rasLSL/þ/Ptenﬂ/ﬂ mice via intrabursal delivery of
adenovirus-carrying Cre recombinase (Adeno-Cre). Tumor
cells were engineered to express luciferase activated by
Adeno-Cre. Once mice developed medium to large tumors,
they were placed into one of four groups, and treated with
vehicle, free PI103, PI103-SNP, or iRGD-PI103-SNP at doses
equivalent to 5 mg/kg of PI103. Tumor imaging was performed
using an IVIS Lumina II Imaging System. Quantiﬁcation of
bioluminescence was achieved by using Living Image Software
3.1 (Caliper Life Sciences). Images were taken a day before
initial treatment (day 0, baseline image), and the day after three
or ﬁve cycles of treatments. The 4306-cell line was established
from these Cre-induced K-rasþ/Pten murine tumors in the
Dinulescu Laboratory, and genotyping was done periodically
by PCR analysis of DNA for characterization.
Western blot analysis
For in vitro studies, 5  104 cells were seeded in each well of a
6-well plate and incubated with free drug or SNPs (with equivalent amount of drug) for 24 hours. For in vivo studies, tumor
stored in 80 C was pulverized in a mortar and pestle using
liquid nitrogen. Proteins were extracted with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. Protein lysates were fractionated by
electrophoresis, transferred to membranes, which were incubated with antibodies against phosphorylated proteins, and probed
with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody.
Detection was done using a G-box (Syngene), and densitometric
quantiﬁcation was done by ImageJ software. Expression was
normalized to total expression of the speciﬁc protein or b-actin.
Tumor histocytochemistry
Tumor cryosections were directly imaged using a
Nikon TE2000 epiﬂuorescence microscope for studying the

Blood vessels were delineated using vonWillebrand factor
(vWF) immunostaining. For studying apoptosis, formalin-ﬁxed
tumor sections were stained with a standard TMR-red ﬂuorescent terminal deoxynucleotidyl tranferase–mediated dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) kit following the manufacturer's
protocol (the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit; TMR-Red;
Roche).

The statistical analysis was done using a two-tailed Student t test or one-way ANOVA followed by Newman–Keuls
post hoc test, with P < 0.05 as the threshold for signiﬁcance.

Results
Synthesis and characterization of PI3K-inhibiting SNPs
We used two different PI3K inhibitors, the pyridofuropyrimidine PI103, and PI828 (8-bromo-2-morpholin-4-yl-chromen-4-one) to engineer the SNPs. PI828 is a derivative of the
earlier generation and widely used PI3K inhibitor LY294002, in
which an amine linker has been inserted in 4-position hydrogen of the exocyclic phenyl substituent, enabling conjugation
to cholesterol via a carbamate bond (Fig. 1A). Previous studies
have demonstrated that conjugation via this linker maintains
afﬁnity for the catalytic site of PI3K class I isoforms (20).
However, PI828, like LY294002, is a weak inhibitor (20). We
therefore included, PI103, which has been reported to exhibit
excellent potency in the low nanomolar range and selectivity
for class IA PI3Ks as well as mTOR (12). However, PI103 was not
found suitable for clinical development as the planar tricyclic
structure resulted in limited aqueous solubility and the phenolic hydroxyl group is rapidly glucoronidated (12). These
limitations, however, made PI103 a suitable molecule to engineer the SNPs. As shown in Fig. 1B, the phenolic hydroxyl group
was conjugated via an ester linkage to cholesterol–succinate
complex. The intermediate and products were characterized
by 1H-NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (Supplementary Figs. S1–S3).
We engineered the SNPs from the cholesterol–PI828 or
cholesterol–PI103 conjugates, phosphatidylcholine and
DSPE-PEG2000 at optimized weight ratios using a lipid-ﬁlm
hydration self-assembly method (Fig. 1C; ref. 21). The incorporation efﬁciency for the cholesterol-PI828 SNPs was 43%,
and 60%  5% for PI103–cholesterol conjugate SNPs. As
shown in Fig. 1D, cholesterol–PI828 conjugates resulted
in the formation of SNPs with hydrodynamic diameter of
108  8.9 nm as determined by DLS (Fig. 1D). PI103 SNPs
showed a mean particle diameter of 172  1.8 nm (Fig. 1E).
Ultrastructure analysis using cryo-transmission electron
microscopy (cryo-TEM; Fig. 1F) revealed the formation of
predominantly unilamellar structures 100 nm or less in diameter. The size difference between TEM and DLS measurements can be attributed to the hydration sphere arising from
the PEG coating, which can facilitate the masking from the
reticuloendothelial system (22). In addition, aliquots of the
PI103-SNPs stored for a period of more than a month exhibited no changes in size and z potential, indicating that the

6990

Cancer Res; 73(23) December 1, 2013

formulations were stable (Fig. 1G). Temporal release kinetics
revealed a sustained release of active drug in cell lysate
(Fig. 1H and I), consistent with the cleavage of the linkers in
acidic and enzymatic (esterase) conditions. Interestingly, the
rate of release of PI828 was signiﬁcantly lower, consistent with
the more stable carbamate linker (cleaved by carboxyesterases). As a control experiment, we tried engineering nanoparticles using traditional approaches of nanoformulation,
in which we entrapped PI103 in the lipid bilayer (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Using the lipid ratio employed with the SNPs
resulted in minimal incorporation efﬁciency of 2% PI103,
which could be optimized by changing the compositional
ratio (Supplementary Fig. S4B). A sustained release of PI103
was observed from the formulation (Supplementary Fig. S4C),
resulting in similar effects on cell viability (Supplementary
Fig. S4D), and inhibition of Akt phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S4E). However, light scattering studies revealed a
temporal increase in the size of the nanoparticles (Supplementary Fig. S4F), leading to precipitation (instability; Supplementary Fig. S4G), consistent with the fact that currently
available strategies for nanoformulation are not be compatible
with many molecules, which has limited the repertoire of
nanomedicines.
In vitro efﬁcacy of SNPs
We evaluated the efﬁcacy of the SNPs in vitro using 4T1
(murine breast cancer), MDA-MB-468 (human breast cancer),
and a PI3K-overexpressing 4306 (ovarian cancer) cell lines (Fig.
2A–F). Temporal effect on cell viability and IC50 values are
shown in Fig. 2I. Although we observed a decrease in the
potency following conjugation of the active molecules to
cholesterol, this is consistent with a prodrug approach, in
which the construct requires activation to the parent molecule
for efﬁcacy. Western blot analysis showed that continuous
incubation with both the free drug as well the SNP (at equimolar concentrations of PI103) induced a sustained inhibition
of basal phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, on the
other hand, a transient exposure more than 4 hours resulted in
a rebound increase in phosphorylation of AKT in the case of
free PI103, whereas SNP-PI103 inhibited Akt phosphorylation
in a more sustained manner (Fig. 3B and C). Indeed, the
transient treatment resulted in an initial higher intracellular
concentration of PI103 in the cells treated with the free drug
compared with SNP-PI103. However, although the concentration remained elevated in the PI103-SNP–treated cells, only
traces of the drug were detected in the cells treated with the
free drug by 18 hours (Fig. 3D) in line with the need for
conversion to active drug in the case of SNPs. Consistent with
the above observations, PI828-SNPs and free PI828 exhibited
similar cytotoxic effect on the 4T1 cells (Fig. 2G) and 4306 cells
(Fig. 2H). The cells treated with PI103-SNPs and PI828-SNPs
exhibited similar inhibition of Akt phosphorylation after
36 hours of treatment (Fig. 3E).
Efﬁcacy of SNP in an in vivo 4T1 breast cancer model
We next investigated the antitumor efﬁcacy of PI103-SNPs in
the 4T1-cell line, which is negative for estrogen receptor and
progesterone receptor, and expresses a low level of the mouse

tumor growth inhibition over the study period. To test whether
targeting the nanoparticles to the tumor using "homing" peptides increases antitumor efﬁcacy, a separate group of tumorbearing mice were treated with PI103-SNPs that were surfacedecorated with iRGD peptide. As shown in Fig. 4A, such a
treatment resulted in greater tumor inhibition compared with
SNPs that accumulated via passive uptake. Indeed, previous
observations have shown that iRGD-coated nanostructures
exhibit increased extravasation and tissue penetration in a
tumor-speciﬁc and neuropilin-1–dependent manner (26). To
elucidate the mechanism underlying the increased in vivo
efﬁcacy, the tumors were excised after treatment, and processed for TUNEL as a marker for apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 4B
and C, treatment with PI103-SNPs resulted in greater apoptosis
than treatment with free PI103. Although we did observe an
enhanced antitumor efﬁcacy with iRGD-coated PI103-SNPs,
stereologic analysis of multiple tumor sections revealed a statistically insigniﬁcant increase in the level of apoptosis compared with PI103-SNP. Epiﬂuorescence imaging of tumor
cross-sections did reveal intratumoral localization of FAMlabeled iRGD-coated PI103-SNPs (Fig. 4D). We next studied the
effect of treatment on survival of 4T1-bearing mice. The 4T1
model is an aggressive form of breast tumor, and the animals
become moribund and have to be sacriﬁced before the tumor
reaching maximum tumor cutoffs. Hence, the 4T1 syngeneic
implants serves as an excellent model for generating Kaplan–
Meier survival curves. As shown in Fig. 4E, three cycles of PI103SNP signiﬁcantly increased the median survival by 2 days as
compared with free PI103 treatment (P < 0.05). Pharmacodynamic monitoring revealed that phosphorylation of Akt and
downstream signaling molecules mTOR and 4EBP were signiﬁcantly inhibited in the PI103-SNP–treated tumors than
in the PI103-treated tumors (P < 0.05, Student t test; Fig. 4 F

and G). Treatment with PI828-SNPs (5 mg/kg PI828 equivalent,
3 doses) also exerted an inhibitory effect on Akt phosphorylation in vivo translating into superior tumor growth inhibition
as compared with free PI828 (Supplementary Fig S5). However,
consistent with its low potency, the antitumor efﬁcacy of PI828
or PI828-SNP was signiﬁcantly lower than seen with PI103SNPs. However, given that the both PI103-SNPs and PI828SNPs did inhibit PI3K signaling, it is possible that the release
kinetics (rate of release) of the active agent plays a critical role
in efﬁcacy and needs to be considered in the design of SNPs.
Efﬁcacy of PI103-SNPs in an in vivo K-RasLSL/þ/Ptenﬂ/ﬂ
ovarian cancer model
We further evaluated the effect of PI103-SNP in a K-RasLSL/þ/
Ptenﬂ/ﬂ ovarian cancer model (27). We selected this model
because tumors that lack Pten have been reported to be
addicted to PI3K signaling (7). On the other hand, tumors
that present a mutated or activated Ras have been reported
to be less responsive to PI3K inhibitors (7). As shown in Fig.
5A–C, bioluminescence quantiﬁcation of tumor luciferase
signal indicates that free PI103, PI103-SNP, and iRGD-PI103SNP resulted in signiﬁcant tumor regression as compared
with vehicle control. The antitumor response to iRGD-PI103SNP was statistically signiﬁcantly superior to free PI103 after
three cycles of treatments as quantiﬁed by the bioluminescence signal. This distinction between free drug and PI103SNPs was attained only after ﬁve cycles of treatment, consistent with previous observations that iRGD facilitates
intratumoral penetrance and accumulation. No change in
body weight was observed in any treatment group (Fig. 5D).
The expression levels of PI3K/mTOR pathway markers, as
assessed by Western blot analysis of tumor samples from
different groups, showed a signiﬁcant decrease in the

and phospho4EBP1 in the PI103-SNP and the iRGD-PI103SNP–treated groups as compared with the free PI103-treated
tumors (Fig. 5E).
Effect of PI103-SNP on glucose homeostasis
PI3K plays a central role in mediating insulin signaling
that is conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution. We
therefore investigated the effect of PI103-SNPs on insulin
tolerance in a 4T1 breast cancer model. Consistent with
previous studies (28), mice injected with free PI103 exhibited
a transient tolerance to insulin compared with the signiﬁcant insulin-induced decrease in blood glucose level
observed in mice pretreated with PI103-SNP or with empty
nanoparticles as a control (Fig. 6A). The insulin response
was restored at later time points, consistent with previous
studies with PI103 (28), and can arise from the short half-life
of PI103. Interestingly, we did not observe any change in
glucose levels following PI103-SNP treatment compared
with vehicle-treated controls over the study period, suggesting that the sustained release of PI103 from the nanoparticles and the increased efﬁcacy did not manifest in a
delayed onset of insulin resistance. Treatment with free
PI828 or PI828-SNP did not affect glucose response to insulin
at the doses used (Fig. 6B), consistent with the low potency
of the active agent as compared with PI103. Furthermore, we

www.aacrjournals.org

analyzed tissue sections from liver, kidney, and spleen, three
organs that are implicated in clearance of nanoparticles. As
shown in Fig. 6C, TUNEL study revealed no distinctions
between the different treatments. This was validated using
Western blotting for monitoring the expression of phosphomTOR as well as cleaved caspase-3 and PARP (as markers of
induction of apoptosis), which revealed no differences
between free PI103- or PI103-SNP–treated animals (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
The challenges faced in clinical translation of PI3K inhibitors
have highlighted the need to overcome feedback signaling and
insulin resistance "class effect," and to achieve high intratumoral concentration of the drug (29). Here, we demonstrate
that the SNPs can induce a sustained inhibition of the PI3K,
resulting in potentially overcoming feedback signaling. Furthermore, this sustained inhibition of PI3K signaling results in
increased antitumor efﬁcacy without insulin resistance, indicating that the use of supramolecular nanochemistry can
emerge as a powerful strategy for overcoming the challenges
faced during clinical translation of PI3K inhibitors.
Indeed, our study demonstrates that an acute exposure to
the free drug (PI103) results in an increase in the phospho-Akt
levels at later time points. Such a rebound activation of the
pathway is consistent with previous reports (29, 30), arising

from a homeostatic feedback loop via the upregulation of
receptor tyrosine kinases (31). Interestingly, treatment with
the PI103-SNPs could potentially overcome this feedback loop
as evident from a sustained inhibition of the phospho-Akt
signal. This could arise from an increase in the intracellular
concentration of PI103 with time, achieved with SNPs. Indeed,
Western blot analysis of the in vivo tumor samples (extracted
72 hours of administration of dose) revealed a robust PI3K
signaling in tumors from animals that were treated with free
PI103. In contrast, treatment with PI103-SNP resulted in
complete shutdown of the pathway, as evident from decreased
levels of phosphorylated forms of Akt, S6K, 4E-BP1, or mTOR
in both tumor models (indeed PI828-NPs exerted a similar
sustained inhibition on phosphorylation of Akt in vitro and

in vivo as compared with free PI828, but it is unlikely that
PI828-SNP will emerge as a potential drug candidate for
reasons described later). Indeed, in a recent commentary,
Courtney and colleagues had posed the question whether
lack of efﬁcacy of PI3K inhibitors is due to inadequate inhibition of the target or because complete inhibition of the
target is not sufﬁcient to produce antitumor activity (31). The
current results indicate that in addition to the level of inhibition of the pathway, the temporality or kinetics of inhibition
may be a critical element in determining antitumor outcome.
Interestingly, a similar observation was made during the
evolution of a current clinical candidate GDC-0941 from PI103,
in which approximately 90% inhibition of Akt phosphorylation for several hours was seen as a requirement for antitumor

activity, establishing a link between pharmacokinetic exposure and pharmacodynamic biomarker changes (9). Indeed,
this is validated by the fact that free inhibitors were found to
be more potent that the SNPs in vitro under conditions of
sustained exposure (as the latter has to be activated into the
active moiety), whereas SNPs were more effective in vivo,
potentially arising from sustained intratumoral concentrations as compared with the free drug. An additional point to
note was that we did see a disconnect between the expression
levels of phosphorylated Akt and downstream phosphorylated
proteins, such as S6K, 4E-BP1, in which although p-Akt was
observed in some SNP-treated tumor tissues the downstream

www.aacrjournals.org

proteins were still inhibited. This captures the kinetics of
ﬂow of information through a signaling cascade, potentially
dissected because of the temporal inhibition attained with the
SNPs as opposed to an "all or none" inhibition seen with
free inhibitors. This also highlights the necessity to include
the distinct levels of PI3K signal transduction pathway, as
opposed to monitoring only phosphorylation of Akt, as biomarkers for efﬁcacy (32).
Clearly, the transient resistance to insulin observed with
PI103, together with its short half-life and its ability to inhibit
tumor growth, suggests that insulin resistance could possibly be
a Cmax-driven effect, whereas the antitumor efﬁcacy is a function

of sustained exposure (area under curve or AUC-driven effect).
This is supported by the results with PI828, which showed no
resistance to insulin at the dose used but did exert an inhibitory
effect on tumor growth. This could also explain why PI103-SNP
exerted a signiﬁcant intratumoral PI3K inhibition, resulting in
increased antitumor efﬁcacy (arising from a sustained release of
active drug), but did not induce insulin tolerance, indicating that
the SNPs approach can indeed overcome the current challenges
associated with PI3K inhibitors.
Indeed, the integration of supramolecular nanochemistry
with targeted therapeutics can open up new opportunities to
harness the full potential of targeted therapeutics by
enhancing the therapeutic index. As seen in the case of
PI103, it can potentially overcome limitations that had
prevented potent molecules from advancing further, and
can enable the rescue of "failed" drugs (12). Furthermore,
this study reveals that the supramolecular nanochemistry–
based approach can potentially enable the fabrication of
nanomedicines from drugs that are not compatible with
currently used techniques of nanoformulation. Indeed, in a
recent study, we had demonstrated that such SNPs of
cisplatin resulted in stable formulations, increased drug
loading efﬁciency and enhanced delivery to the tumors as
opposed to free cisplatin (16). However, the contrasts in the
outcomes with PI103- and PI828-SNPs also highlight the
need for keeping design principles in perspective when
engineering the SNPs. In some manner, this is similar to
the design principles for a successful antibody–drug conjugate (33), in which selection of a potent active agent and the

optimal linker chemistry is critical to efﬁcacy, with the
nanoparticle enabling a preferential delivery to the tumor.
In summary, several components of the current approach
can facilitate future therapy in humans. First, the ability of
nanoparticles to accumulate in tumors can lead to increased
efﬁcacy. Second, the sustained release resulting in prolonged
inhibition of the PI3K pathway and absence of the "feedback
loop" could be a critical determinant in clinical success.
Third, the absence of insulin resistance with the PI103-SNP
indicates that supramolecular nanochemistry can signiﬁcantly
impact the therapeutic index. We also demonstrate that the
efﬁcacy can be further improved by placing active targeting
moieties such as iRGD peptides on the nanoparticle surface.
Indeed, the fact that the nanoparticle assembles from unit
molecules offers an exquisite control over the stoichiometry
in terms of active agents as well as the valency of targeting
agents. This stoichiometric control also means that supramolecular nanochemistry platform can potentially be extended
to additional cytotoxics and molecularly targeted therapeutics
including enabling combination therapy from a single nanoparticle, thereby facilitating an integrative approach toward
cancer chemotherapy.
