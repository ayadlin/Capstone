Abstract
Interest in combining radiotherapy and immune checkpoint
therapy is growing rapidly. In this study, we explored a novel
combination of this type to augment antitumor immune
responses in preclinical murine models of melanoma, neuroblastoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Cooperative
effects were observed with local radiotherapy and intratumoral
injection of tumor-speciﬁc antibodies, arising in part from
enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
(ADCC). We could improve this response by combining radiation
with intratumoral injection of an IL2-linked tumor-speciﬁc antibody (termed here an immunocytokine), resulting in complete
regression of established tumors in most animals associated with
a tumor-speciﬁc memory T-cell response. Given the T-cell

response elicited by combined local radiation and intratumoral
immunocytokine, we tested the potential beneﬁt of adding this
treatment to immune checkpoint blockade. In mice bearing large
primary tumors or disseminated metastases, the triple-combination of intratumoral immunocytokine, radiation, and systemic
anti–CTLA-4 improved primary tumor response and animal
survival compared with combinations of any two of these three
interventions. Taken together, our results show how combining
radiation and intratumoral immunocytokine in murine tumor
models can eradicate large tumors and metastases, eliciting an in
situ vaccination effect that can be leveraged further by T-cell
checkpoint blockade, with immediate implications for clinical
evaluation. Cancer Res; 76(13); 3929–41. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

but may also initiate a tumor-directed immune response by
engaging Fcg receptors (FcgR) on innate immune cells (2). Upon
binding the Fc portion of mAb, these immune cells can destroy
mAb-bound tumor cells through the process of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Tumor-speciﬁc mAbs
bound to dying tumor cells can also interact with FcgR
on antigen-presenting cells, resulting in enhanced antigen presentation to the adaptive immune system, thereby augmenting
activation of a T-cell response (3).
We have been exploring approaches to enhance the immune
response induced by administration of mAb-based therapies that
are able to selectively bind to speciﬁc antigens on the surface of
tumor cells. Our focus has been on mAbs targeting disialoganglioside D2 (GD2), which is expressed in neuroblastoma and
melanoma (4). Antibodies targeting GD2 are thought to elicit
antitumor effects primarily through ADCC (5–7). Others and we
have been exploring how increased activation of ADCC effector
cells may augment this effect (8–11). We have investigated the
effect of cytokines that activate natural killer (NK) cells and
myeloid elements (12) and demonstrated that treatment with
anti-GD2 mAb, combined with IL2 and GM-CSF, improves overall survival in children with neuroblastoma (13). These studies
attest to the potential of combinatorial approaches to augment
immune response to tumor-speciﬁc mAbs.
Multiple studies of clinically relevant murine tumor models
indicate that the most immunogenic tumor antigens recognized
by T cells are "private antigens" derived from mutated proteins in
tumor cells (14, 15). In situ tumor vaccination is a therapeutic

Radiation and tumor-speciﬁc antibodies (mAbs) are frequently
used together in the treatment of human cancers. Nevertheless,
the potential interaction of radiation with the antitumor immune
effects induced by tumor-speciﬁc mAbs has not been well elucidated. Radiation elicits an antitumor effect through the induction
of DNA damage, yet may also affect tumor immune tolerance (1).
In rare instances, local radiation treatment can trigger a systemic or
"abscopal" immune response at nonradiated tumor sites in
patients with metastatic disease. Tumor-speciﬁc mAbs are commonly designed to antagonize a target molecule on tumor cells,

strategy aimed at taking advantage of these antigens by converting
a patient's tumor into a nidus for adaptive immunologic recognition (16). In this report, we test whether radiation might
augment the antitumor immune response induced by tumorspeciﬁc mAbs in multiple tumor-bearing mouse models. We
characterize a cooperative interaction between local radiation
and intratumoral (IT) delivery of tumor-speciﬁc mAb therapeutics
and demonstrate the capacity of this combined treatment to elicit
an in situ vaccination effect that may be leveraged to improve the
response to systemic T-cell checkpoint blockade.

Materials and Methods
Cells
B78-D14 (B78) melanoma is derived from B16 melanoma, as
previously described (17) and was obtained from Ralph Reisfeld
(Scripps Research Institute) in 2002. B16-F10 melanoma was
obtained from the ATCC in 2005 and the Panc02 pancreatic tumor
cells were obtained from the NCI in 2012. B78, B16, and Panc02
cells were grown in RPMI-1640 (Mediatech) supplemented
with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and
100 mg/mL streptomycin. NXS2 is a murine neuroblastoma hybrid
cell line obtained from Ralph Reisfeld (Scripps Research Institute)
in 1997 and grown as previously described (18). The acquired
cetuximab-resistant clone, SCC1-C, was derived from UM-SCC1
cells (Thomas Carey, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) in
2009 and cultured as previously described (19). Cell authentication was performed per ATCC guidelines using morphology,
growth curves, and Mycoplasma testing within 6 months of use.
Clonogenic and cytotoxicity assays
In vitro clonogenic (20) and 51chromium-release cytotoxicity
assays (21) were performed as previously described. For clonogenic assays, mAb, IC, or IgG were introduced at 1 mg/mL 30
minutes before radiation and maintained in media for the duration of experiments. For cytotoxicity assays, target cells were
labeled with 51chromium and incubated for 4 hours in the
presence of 1 mg/mL cetuximab or control IgG with or without
fresh peripheral blood mononuclear effector cells (21). ADCC
was measured using a beta counter (Packard Matrix 9600) to
quantify release of 51chromium.
Murine tumor models
Animals were housed and treated under an animal protocol
approved by the institutional animal care and use committee.
Female mice were purchased at age 6 to 8 weeks from Taconic
(C57BL/6 and Fcg receptor-deﬁcient C57BL/6.129P2-Fcer1gtm1Rav
N12), Harlan (NcR nude mice), and Jackson (A/J and FasLdeﬁcient C57BL/6 Smn.C3-Tnfsf6gld/J).
B78, B16, NXS2, and Panc02 tumors were engrafted by subcutaneous ﬂank injection of 2  106 tumor cells. For disseminated
disease models 3.5  105 B16 cells were IV injected. Engraftment
of SCC1-C was performed by subcutaneous ﬂank injection of 3 
106 cells ¼ in 2:1 PBS:Matrigel (BD Biosciences).
Tumor size was determined using calipers and volume approximated as (width2  length)/2. Mice were randomized immediately before treatment. The day of radiation was deﬁned as "day 1"
of treatment. IT injections were made by a single percutaneous
needle puncture followed by injection of a 100 mL volume with
needle redirection to distribute injected material around the
tumor. IT injections of 50 mg hu14.18K322A, cetuximab,

3930 Cancer Res; 76(13) July 1, 2016

hu14.18-IL2, or control IgG were delivered daily on days 6 to
10. Anti–CTLA-4 or control IgG was administered by 200 mg
intraperitoneal (IP) injection days 3, 6, and 9. For NK cell
depletion, IP injections of 500 mg NK1.1 mAb (clone PK136,
ATCC) were delivered days 1, 5, 10, and 15. Depletion of T cells
was performed as previously described (22).
Treatment began when tumors were well established (200
mm3), occurring approximately 5 weeks after tumor implantation
for B78 melanoma. For "large" B78 tumors (500 mm3), treatment began approximately 7 weeks after implantation. Animals
were sacriﬁced when tumors exceeded a pre-determined dimension. Mouse experiments were repeated in triplicate. Final replicates are presented for tumor response and aggregate data for
survival; number of animals (n) per group is indicated.
Radiation
Radiation of cells in vitro was performed using a cesium source
irradiator (JL Shepherd Model 109). Radiation was delivered to in
vivo tumors by an X-RAD 320 (Precision X-Ray, Inc.). Mice were
immobilized using custom lead jigs that exposed the dorsal right
ﬂank. For in vivo experiments radiation was delivered in one
fraction to a maximum dose of 12 Gy.
Antibodies and Immunocytokine
Hu14.18K322A was provided by Children's GMP, LLC (6). A
monovalent Fab-only fragment of this was generated using a
Pierce kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc, No. 44985). Cetuximab (Eli Lilly)
and Gammagard non-speciﬁc human IgG (Baxter) were obtained
through the University of Wisconsin pharmacy. Hu14.18-IL2 was
provided by Apeiron Biologics (23). Anti–CTLA-4 (clone 9D9)
was provided by Bristol Myers Squibb.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed on at least nine distinct
tumor sections from at least 3 mice for each treatment condition
to characterize and quantify tumor immune cell inﬁltrate on day
12 following radiation as previously described (24).
Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry was performed as previously described (25)
using a MacsQuant analyzer (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were labeled
as indicated using hu14.18 þ PE-conjugated anti-human mAb
(SAB1294; Open Biosystems), FITC-labeled anti-Fas/CD95
(15404D, BD Biosciences), respective isotype control (Human
IgG, Baxter; FITC-labeled Hamster IgG, Pharmingen), and/or
DAPI. FlowJo Software was used for analysis. Forward- and
side-scatter gating identiﬁed single cells and DAPI exclusion
identiﬁed live cells. For Fas-activation experiments, cells were
radiated with 12 Gy and 6 days later were incubated for 18 hours
with 1 mg/mL Fas-activating mAb (JO-2, BD Biosciences) or
control IgG in normal media at 37 C. Cells were stained with
propidium iodide without ﬁxation and apoptotic fraction was
deﬁned by the ratio of propidium-positive to total cells.
Quantiﬁcation of lung metastases
Animals injected IV with B16 melanoma were sacriﬁced 15 to
20 days after radiation. All animals within an experiment were
sacriﬁced on a pre-determined day or earlier if they became
moribund. Blinded quantiﬁcation of metastatic foci per lung was
performed (B16 tumors are black). The experiment was performed in triplicate and aggregate data are presented.

Morris et al.

To explore the generalizability of an interaction between radiation and tumor-speciﬁc mAb, we used nude mice engrafted with
the human head and neck cancer (HNC) tumor cell line, SCC1-C.
We have previously demonstrated that these cells express EGFR at
the plasma membrane, but are resistant to in vitro inhibition of
proliferation by the anti-EGFR mAb cetuximab (19). Unlike most
cetuximab-sensitive cells, we observed no intrinsic sensitization of
these "cetuximab-resistant" cells to radiation following treatment
with cetuximab in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S3A). On the other
hand, these cells remain sensitive to cetuximab-mediated ADCC
(Supplementary Fig. S3B). SCC1-C cells, therefore, represent a
tool for enabling interrogation of the interaction between radiation and ADCC response to cetuximab in the absence of confounding effects from EGFR inhibition on cell proliferation and
radiosensitivity. We treated mice bearing SCC1-C tumors with 12
Gy or sham radiation and 5 daily IT injections of cetuximab or
control IgG (50 mg/injection) on days 6 to 10 after radiation. We
observed modest tumor inhibition from cetuximab alone compared with control IgG and a strongly enhanced response to the
combination of cetuximab and radiation compared with radiation and control IgG (Fig. 1E and F). This suggested generalizability for the cooperative interaction of radiation and ADCC.

Statistical analyses
Tumor response and animal weight plots are displayed as
means  SE. Mixed effect models on log-transformed data were
used to estimate and compare the slopes of tumor response and
animal weight curves. Survival curves were generated using the
Kaplan–Meier method and compared using log-rank tests. Results
of immunohistochemistry, B16 metastasis, and IFN response
experiments were evaluated using ANOVA with post-testing done
using two-sample t tests. Clonogenic assays were evaluated by
two-tailed two-sample t tests comparing treatment groups at each
dose of radiation. Rates of complete response and tumor engraftment were compared between groups using c2 analysis. P values
less than 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant and are indicated in
ﬁgures as  , P < 0.001;  , P < 0.01;  , P < 0.05; NS, nonsigniﬁcant
(P  0.05). Analyses were performed using JMP and SAS software
(SAS Institute).

Results
Cooperative interaction of radiation and tumor-speciﬁc mAbs
To examine whether radiation may enhance the antitumor
immune response elicited by tumor-speciﬁc mAbs, we tested
combinations of radiation and the anti-GD2 mAb hu14.18K322A
in the treatment of macroscopic, syngeneic, GD-2–expressing
tumors (B78 melanoma and NXS2 neuroblastoma) in two distinct murine strains (C57BL/6 and A/J, respectively). Animals
were treated with either sham or single-fraction radiation (12
Gy) and 5 daily IT injections (50 mg/injection) of either anti-GD2
mAb or non-speciﬁc control IgG. Although hu14.18K322A alone
had no perceptible impact on tumor growth in these macroscopic
tumor models, treatment with this mAb following radiation
resulted in increased tumor response and delay of tumor regrowth
(Fig. 1A and B) and a trend toward, or signiﬁcantly improved
survival (Fig. 1C and D, respectively). Monitoring of animal
weights (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B) demonstrated no
added toxicity from combined IT-hu14.18K322A and radiation.
In prior preclinical studies, we have demonstrated enhanced local
and systemic anti-tumor immune response with IT as compared
with intravenous (i.v.) delivery of anti-GD2 antibody therapeutics
(24). Here, we conﬁrmed that even when following radiation, IT
injection of anti-GD2 mAb resulted in improved tumor response
compared with i.v. delivery (Supplementary Fig. S2).

NK cells are critical to the cooperative interaction of radiation
and tumor-speciﬁc mAb
We have previously demonstrated that hu14.18 mAb elicits
ADCC against both B78 and NXS2 cells (25, 27). The
hu14.18K322A mAb has been further engineered to abrogate
complement binding and is thought to primarily mediate a
therapeutic effect through ADCC (6). Importantly, the GD2
antigen is not known to have a functional role in cell survival,
proliferation, DNA damage response, or other cellular processes
known to interact with radiation. In support of this, we have
conﬁrmed that hu14.18K322A does not affect the intrinsic sensitivity of B78 or NXS2 cells to radiation using in vitro clonogenic
assays (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B). We have also conﬁrmed
that radiation does not increase the expression of GD2 in B78 or
NXS2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4C and S4D).
We evaluated whether the cooperative in vivo interaction of
hu14.18K322A and radiation (Fig. 1A–D) resulted from ADCC.
To conﬁrm that this interaction required the GD2 antigen, we
tested the combination of radiation and hu14.18K322A in a

which retains the ability to bind GD2 but is unable to engage
FcgR, did not affect tumor response when given following
radiation (Fig. 2A). In addition, the cooperative effect of
radiation and hu14.18K322A was not observed in FcgR-deﬁcient mice (Fig. 2B) or mice depleted of NK cells (Fig. 2C).
Collectively these results suggest that the in vivo interaction of
radiation and hu14.18K322A is mediated, at least in part, by
NK cells through ADCC.
Improved tumor control and survival with combined radiation
and tumor-speciﬁc immunocytokine
We next sought to investigate whether the cooperative interaction between radiation and the antitumor immune response
induced by administration of tumor-speciﬁc mAbs might be
improved by substituting mAb with immunocytokine (IC)—a
synthetic fusion protein consisting of a tumor-speciﬁc antibody

genetically linked to an immune-stimulating cytokine. ICs exert
antitumor effects by both targeting and stimulating the
immune system to selectively destroy cancer cells. Hu14.18IL2 IC consists of human IL2 genetically fused to each IgG
heavy chain of the GD2 mAb, hu14.18 (23). Prior studies have
demonstrated that this IC activates ADCC and additional
immune pathways (28), has greater in vivo antitumor activity
than equivalent mixtures of mAb and IL2 (29), and has clinical
antitumor activity (30). Importantly, administration of IT-IC is
clinically feasible with early studies suggesting promising therapeutic effects (31).
In our syngeneic B78 melanoma model, we treated mice with
12 Gy or sham radiation and 5 daily IT injections of hu14.18IL2 or control IgG (50 mg/injection) on days 6 to 10 after
radiation. The combination of radiation and hu14.18-IL2 did
not appear toxic as gauged by animal appearance and weight
(Supplementary Fig. S1C). We observed a strong cooperative
interaction between radiation and hu14.18-IL2, resulting in
enhanced tumor response and animal survival (Fig. 3A and B).
For this moderate-size tumor model (200 mm3 at the time of
radiation), we observed complete tumor regression and disease-free survival beyond 100 days in 71% (22/31) of animals
compared with 14% (3/21) of those treated with radiation and

Hu14.18-IL2 did not affect the intrinsic sensitivity of cells to
radiation in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S4G). As expected,
hu14.18-IL2 had no effect on tumor response or animal
survival following radiation in mice bearing GD2-deﬁcient
B16 melanoma (Supplementary Fig. S4E and S4F). The impact

of hu14.18-IL2 on tumor growth following radiation in FcgRdeﬁcient mice was modest, albeit signiﬁcant (Fig. 3C), yet did
not affect animal survival (Fig. 3D). This tumor-growth inhibition by IC (but not by mAb) in FcgR-deﬁcient mice may
reﬂect the capacity of hu14.18-IL2 to tether effector cells to
tumor cells via IL2 receptors, as previously reported (32).

Morris et al.

Combined radiation and IC triggers in situ vaccination and a
memory T-cell response
Using immunohistochemistry, we characterized tumor
immune cell inﬁltrates following treatment with sham or 12 Gy
radiation and hu14.18K322A, hu14.18-IL2, or non-speciﬁc
human IgG. We observed a signiﬁcant approximately 2-fold
increase in tumor inﬁltration by NK cells following treatment
with radiation (Fig. 4A, Supplementary Fig. S5A). This effect was
not signiﬁcantly affected by administration of hu14.18K322A.
Treatment with hu14.18-IL2 alone increased tumor inﬁltrating
NK cells, and this was not signiﬁcantly increased further
by combination with radiation. Neither radiation nor
hu14.18K322A alone or in combination consistently affected
tumor inﬁltration with CD8-positive T cells (Fig. 4B, Supplementary Fig. S5B). In contrast, IC alone modestly increased tumor
inﬁltration with CD8-positive T cells compared with mAb alone
whereas the combination of hu14.18-IL2 and radiation markedly
increased tumor inﬁltration by CD8-positive T cells (Fig. 4B). No
signiﬁcant changes were observed in CD4-positive T-cell tumor
inﬁltrate between the compared treatment regimens, although
there was a trend toward increased inﬁltrate with combined 12 Gy
and hu14.18-IL2 (P ¼ 0.14 vs. IgG alone, Fig. 4C, Supplementary
Fig. S5C).
To investigate the role of speciﬁc immune cell lineages in the
response to combined radiation and mAb or IC, we examined the
efﬁcacy of treatment in immunodeﬁcient mice. Depletion of NK
cells eliminated the synergistic interaction between radiation and
hu14.18K322A mAb (Fig. 2C) but did not prevent that of radiation and hu14.18-IL2 (Fig. 4D and E). On the other hand,
treatment in nude mice, which lack mature T cells, did not
preclude the cooperative interaction of hu14.18K322A with radiation but reduced the efﬁcacy of radiation and hu14.18-IL2 to a
level not signiﬁcantly different from that of radiation and
hu14.18K322A (Fig. 4F and G). This suggests that when combined with radiation in immunologically intact mice,
hu14.18K322A and hu14.18-IL2 both elicit ADCC whereas only
hu14.18-IL2 also generates a T-cell response that is independent
of NK cells.
We quantiﬁed this T-cell response using an ex vivo IFN response
assay. For CD8-positive T cells, we observed an increase in the
percentage of IFNg-positive cells with combined 12 Gy and
hu14.18-IL2 compared with all other treatments, a modest
increase with combined 12 Gy and hu14.18K322A compared
with radiation or mAb alone, and a modest increase with
hu14.18-IL2 compared with hu14.18K322A mAb or IgG (Fig.
5A). For CD4-positive T cells, we observed an increase in the
percentage of IFNg-positive cells with combined 12 Gy and
hu14.18-IL2 compared with all other treatments and a modest
increase with radiation alone compared with IgG (Fig. 5B).
Given this T-cell response, we tested whether the approximately
70% of animals rendered disease-free by combined treatment
with radiation and hu14.18-IL2 developed a memory T-cell
response. For this, we re-injected these animals with B78 melanoma 70 days (range, 73–105) after radiation. Nearly, all of
these animals rejected this second tumor [10% engraftment (2/
20), Fig. 5C] compared with 100% engraftment among agematched control mice (35/35) and 83% (5/6) engraftment
among mice rendered disease-free by surgical resection
(Fig. 5C). Of the few animals rendered disease-free by combined
treatment with radiation and hu14.18K322A mAb, 50% (1/2)
rejected re-engraftment with B78 cells. A subset of mice rendered

3936 Cancer Res; 76(13) July 1, 2016

disease-free following initial treatment with radiation and
hu14.18-IL2 was depleted of T cells and none rejected re-engraftment with B78 cells [100% engraftment (5/5), Fig. 5C].
These ﬁndings suggest a potent antitumor memory T-cell
response among animals rendered disease-free by radiation and
hu14.18-IL2. This memory response was tumor-speciﬁc and adaptive as 9 of 12 of mice remaining disease-free after B78 re-challenge
also rejected engraftment with GD2-deﬁcient B16 melanoma cells
(parental to B78; 25% engraftment, Fig. 5D). None of these mice
rejected simultaneous injection with the unrelated syngeneic
Panc02 pancreatic tumor cell line [100% engraftment (12/12), Fig.
5D]. No age-matched na€ve controls rejected engraftment with the
same B16 or Panc02 cells [100% engraftment (11/11), Fig. 5D].
These results demonstrate that most mice rendered disease-free by
combined radiation and hu14.18-IL2 developed tumor-speciﬁc
immunologic memory to antigen(s) shared by B78 and B16, and
thus distinct from GD2, consistent with an in situ vaccination effect.
Response to combined radiation and IT-IC is time-sensitive and
requires FasL
The timing we have used for administering IT-IC 6 days after
radiation is based on early studies we performed, which showed
that the interaction of radiation and hu14.18-IL2 was strongly
time dependent. IC treatment on days 6 to 10 after radiation was
more effective than treatment days 1 to 5 or 11 to 15 (Fig. 6A and
B). This appeared to be speciﬁc to the cooperative activity of
radiation and hu14.18-IL2; there was no difference in antitumor
effect when giving hu14.18K322A on days 1 to 5 versus 6 to 10
after radiation (Supplementary Fig. S6A). This suggests that the Tcell response generated by combined treatment with radiation
and IC may be dependent on a delayed effect of radiation.
Prior studies show that radiation-induced DNA damage triggers
a p53-dependent increase in Fas/CD95 expression (33, 34). Fas is
a death receptor capable of triggering the extrinsic apoptotic
pathway when engaged by its cognate ligand, FasL. Immune cell
lineages express FasL and tumor cell expression of Fas has been
shown to enhance antitumor ADCC (35) and T-cell responses
(36). We examined the expression of Fas on cultured B78 cells
surviving in vitro radiation and observed dose-dependent induction of expression (Supplementary Fig. S6B) that is quite timedependent (Fig. 6C) and less sensitive to fractionation of radiation (Supplementary Fig. S6C). This time-dependence mirrors the
time-sensitivity that we observe in the in vivo interaction between
radiation and IC (Fig. 6A and B). Using a Fas-activating mAb in
vitro, we determined that the degree of increased Fas expression
induced in B78 cells at 7 days following in vitro radiation with 12
Gy (Fig. 6C) was sufﬁcient to enhance the susceptibility of these
cells to Fas-mediated cytotoxicity (Fig. 6D). Importantly, when
B78 tumors were treated with the combination of radiation and
hu14.18-IL2 in mice lacking the cognate FasL ligand, we no longer
observed enhanced tumor response or animal survival compared
with radiation and control IgG (Fig. 6E and F). This suggests
necessity for the Fas/FasL pathway in the T-cell–dependent synergy of radiation and hu14.18-IL2, similar to the role of this
pathway in T-cell cytotoxicity in vitro (37).
Radiation combined with IC augments response to T-cell
checkpoint inhibition
Given the capacity of radiation and IT injection of hu14.18-IL2
to elicit a T-cell–dependent antitumor response, we hypothesized
that this combination might augment the local and systemic

B78 melanoma response to combined radiation and IC is time-sensitive and requires FasL. Hu14.18-IL2 administration on days 6 to 10 was more effective in
controlling B78 melanoma tumors in vivo than administration on days 1 to 5 or days 11 to 15 after radiation with respect to tumor response (A) and animal survival (B).
C, a similar time sensitivity is seen in the increased expression of Fas/CD95 on live B78 cells following in vitro radiation. Cells received 12 Gy the indicated
number of days before harvest. Fas expression on live single cells was evaluated using ﬂow cytometry. Results of triplicate experiments are expressed as
mean fold-change relative to non-radiated cells  SE. D, the degree of increased Fas/CD95 expression 7 days after in vitro radiation was sufﬁcient to
increase the apoptotic response to Fas-activating mAb. Cells were treated with 12 Gy or sham radiation, maintained in culture for 6 days, and then treated
with Fas-activating mAb or control IgG for 18 hours. The fraction of apoptotic cells was quantiﬁed by ﬂow cytometry. Results are displayed as mean fold-change
(relative to sham RT þ IgG)  standard error. E and F, in FasL-deﬁcient mice, in vivo treatment of B78 tumors with radiation and hu14.18-IL2 resulted in no signiﬁcant
impact on tumor response (P ¼ 0.362; E) or overall survival (P ¼ 0.466; F) compared radiation and IgG. Animals in A and E were engrafted and treated concurrently.

primary tumor (500 mm ), tumor response (A) and animal survival (B) were improved with combined radiation, IT-hu14.18-IL2, and anti–CTLA-4 as compared with
mono- or dual therapy combinations. In separate experiments, to test whether IT-IC adds to the distant antitumor effect of local radiation plus systemic anti–CTLA-4,
we administered B16 melanoma cells (GD2-deﬁcient, and thus resistant to hu14.18-IL2) by i.v. injection on the day of radiation in mice bearing a large B78
tumor. In these animals, the combination of primary tumor radiation, IT-hu14.18-IL2, and anti–CTLA-4 improved survival (C) and reduced the metastatic foci per lung

Radiation Enhances Immune Response to Antitumor Antibodies

compared with mono- or dual combinations. Complete tumor
regression was observed in 73% (8/11) of animals receiving this
triple combination versus 27% (3/11, P ¼ 0.03) with radiation
and hu14.18-IL2, 9% (1/11, P ¼ 0.002) with radiation and anti–
CTLA-4, and no animals in other groups.
Prior preclinical studies in murine models demonstrate an
enhanced local and distant antitumor response when anti–
CTLA-4 treatment is added to local radiation (38–40). On the
basis of the potent tumor-speciﬁc memory demonstrated when
IT-IC is added to local radiation (Fig. 5C and D), we hypothesized
that adding IT-IC to the combination of anti–CTLA-4 and local
radiation would further improve distant antitumor response. To
test this, we generated syngeneic mice bearing a large GD2expressing B78 melanoma "primary" tumor. To test for an adaptive immune response, these animals were given an i.v. injection
of B16 melanoma cells (GD2-deﬁcient, and thus not responsive to
hu14.18-IL2) on the day of radiation. Animals were treated with
combinations of single fraction (12 Gy) or sham radiation to the
primary tumor (day 1), IT injection of the primary tumor with
hu14.18-IL2 or control IgG (days 6–10), and IP anti–CTLA-4 or
control IgG (days 3, 6, and 9). We observed cooperative activity
with the combination of radiation, hu14.18-IL2, and anti–CTLA4 resulting in improved animal survival (Fig. 7C) and reduced
metastatic disease burden compared with animals treated with
radiation and anti–CTLA-4 (Fig. 7D and E).

Discussion
We demonstrate a cooperative interaction between ionizing
radiation and the immune response to tumor-speciﬁc mAbs delivered by IT injection. This effect seems to be generalizable, as we
conﬁrm similar ﬁndings in distinct syngeneic melanoma and
neuroblastoma murine tumor models in different mouse strains
and in a human HNC xenograft tumor model. Using our murine
melanoma model, we determine that this cooperative interaction is
enhanced by substituting tumor-speciﬁc mAb with an IC fusion
protein that genetically links the IgG heavy chain of this mAb with
IL2. This combination of radiation and IT-IC results in a potent Tcell response and adaptive tumor-speciﬁc immunologic memory,
consistent with an in situ vaccination effect. In our preclinical
models, this effect requires IC speciﬁcity for tumor cells and appears
to be mediated at least in part through ADCC. Interestingly, two
prior preclinical studies and a phase I clinical investigation suggest
that cooperative activity may also be elicited through combination
of radiation with ICs that exhibit speciﬁcity for tumor stromal
components and do not directly mediate ADCC (41–43).
As T-cell checkpoint inhibitors become established treatments
for a variety of malignancies, a persistent challenge will be to
increase the rate and degree of response to these agents. In situ
tumor vaccination approaches may be well suited to this task. A
recent study suggests that radiation alone may augment the
response to T-cell checkpoint inhibition by diversifying antigen
recognition in an adaptive immune response (40). In a model of
metastatic melanoma, we now demonstrate that delivery of radiation and IT-IC to a single tumor site may further augment both
local and distant control of disease beyond that achieved with
combined radiation and T-cell checkpoint inhibition. This effect is
observed even with distant disease that lacks the IC target antigen.
Such sites are resistant to direct treatment with radiation and IT-IC
and their elimination is indicative of an adaptive immune response
resulting from an in situ tumor vaccination effect.

Our results also suggest an opportunity for clinical investigations coordinating radiotherapy with the timing and route
of delivery for tumor-speciﬁc mAbs. The interaction of radiation and tumor-speciﬁc mAb has been investigated most
thoroughly in HNC. Preclinical studies demonstrate a role for
i.v. cetuximab in sensitizing tumor cells to ionizing radiation,
likely via the biologic effects of EGFR blockade (20, 44), and a
phase III clinical study demonstrated improved survival with
the addition of concurrent cetuximab to radiation in HNC
patients (45). In the absence of radiation, a dual therapeutic
mechanism has been proposed for EGFR-targeting antibodies
whereby these agents both antagonize EGFR signal pathways
and give rise to ADCC (46). Our results now suggest that
radiation may enhance the in vivo tumor sensitivity to ADCC.
Preclinical and clinical studies may be warranted to determine
whether delivery of these modalities may be optimized to
enhance antitumor immune response.
The interaction of radiation with mAb or IC is likely multifactorial. Following radiation, we observe a beneﬁt to delayed (days
6–10) versus immediate (day 1–5) IC administration. Continued
tumor growth during this interval indicates that radiation does
not merely enable an equivalent immune response against a
reduced tumor volume. Prior studies suggest that cells destined
to die following radiation undergo antigenic death (1) and this
may enhance T-cell response with delayed IC administration. In
addition, phenotypic changes such as increased expression of Fas/
CD95 on cells surviving radiation may enhance tumor immune
susceptibility and subsequent immunogenicity as an in situ vaccine. It remains to be seen whether such changes may be useful
markers for coordinating timing of radio- and immunotherapy in
other settings.
Additional studies are needed to optimize radiation dose and
fractionation for in situ vaccination. We chose a single 12 Gy
fraction, as this can be clinically administered and may induce a
functionally signiﬁcant upregulation in Fas expression (Fig. 6D,
Supplementary Fig. S6B). In the B78 melanoma model, following treatment with 12 Gy alone we do not see tumor
regression in vivo (Fig. 1) nor evidence of increased inﬁltration
or activation of tumor-speciﬁc CD8-positive T cells (Figs. 4B
and 5A). This suggests that the time dependency of IT-IC is not
merely reﬂecting kinetics of detectible tumor-speciﬁc T cells
following radiation.
Our data are consistent with a few intriguing hypotheses. First,
12 Gy radiation causes a modest level of direct in vivo tumor death
and increased susceptibility to effector-cell–mediated death (via
ADCC and T cells). Second, the strong adaptive response to IT-IC,
but not IT mAb, suggests that IC binding to radiated tumor cells
facilitates antigen presentation and augmented induction of
adaptive immunity. Third, this adaptive response can be expanded by anti–CTLA-4 treatment. Local depletion of regulatory T cells
by radiation and anti–CTLA-4 may also play a role in this in situ
vaccination effect. Similarly, radiation may exert a beneﬁcial effect
on immune response by interfering with myeloid-derived suppressor cells (47).
Prior clinical trials of i.v. hu14.18-IL2 in patients with
melanoma and neuroblastoma demonstrated acceptable toxicity and modest antitumor activity (30, 48, 49). On the basis of
the ﬁndings presented here, we are proposing clinical investigations of combined radiation, tumor-speciﬁc mAb or IC, and
T-cell checkpoint inhibition in patients with melanoma and
neuroblastoma.
