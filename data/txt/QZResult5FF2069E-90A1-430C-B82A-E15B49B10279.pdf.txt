Targeted Inhibition of Mammalian
Target of Rapamycin for the
Treatment of Advanced Renal
Cell Carcinoma
Anil Kapoor, MD1 and Robert A. Figlin, MD2

Clinical trials have validated the importance of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) as a targeted
mechanism in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Temsirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor that is
approved for treatment of advanced RCC, has demonstrated both overall survival benefits and progression-free survival benefits versus interferon-a as first-line treatment for patients with poor prognostic features. Exploratory subset analyses indicated that temsirolimus benefits patients with RCC regardless of
tumor histology or nephrectomy status. Everolimus, the second mTOR inhibitor to demonstrate activity in
RCC, improved progression-free survival versus placebo in patients whose disease progressed after treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sunitinib, sorafenib, or
both); benefit was observed for all risk groups. Deforolimus also exhibited antitumor activity against RCC
in early clinical studies. There is now compelling clinical evidence for the effectiveness of targeting mTOR

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) that is confined to the kidney often is treated effectively with surgical resection. However, metastatic disease develops in approximately 33% of patients with RCC, and most of these
patients respond poorly to chemotherapy. Historically, the main treatments for metastatic RCC were
recombinant interferon-a (IFN) and interleukin-2 either alone or in combination, but cytokine therapy
has substantial toxicity and rarely benefits patients who have extensive tumor burden or adverse risk factors.1 Recently, substantial improvements in treatment and outcomes have been realized with 2 classes of
novel targeted therapies for patients with advanced RCC. One class consists of the small-molecule antiangiogenic agents sunitinib and sorafenib, which inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
(VEGFR) tyrosine kinase and the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab when used in combination with IFN.2-4 The second mechanistic class consists of inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR). Clinical trials of the novel mTOR inhibitors temsirolimus and everolimus have demonstrated

benefits in patients with advanced RCC and, thus, have
validated mTOR as an important molecular mechanism
in the pathology of this disease.5,6 In this report, we review
the scientific rationale and evidence to date of the clinical
benefits provided by mTOR inhibitor therapy for patients
with advanced RCC.

mTOR in Tumor Biology
mTOR is a key component of the intracellular signaling
pathways involved in tumor cell proliferation, growth,
survival, and angiogenesis (Fig. 1).7-9 The mTOR serine/
threonine kinase was identified first in yeast (TOR) and
subsequently in mammalian cells (mTOR) as the cellular
target of rapamycin (sirolimus; Rapamune, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, Pa), which is a macrolide
antibiotic that exhibits potent antifungal and immunosuppressive activities.10 TOR and mTOR have an evolutionary conserved role in sensing growth factors and the
nutritional status of the cell and, through their regulatory
effects on messenger RNA (mRNA) translation, allow the
cell cycle to progress from G1 to S-phase.10 Treatment of
cells with rapamycin inhibits the mTOR kinase, resulting
in reduced translation of cell cycle regulator proteins and
an inability to progress from G1 to S-phase.11 The potential for mTOR inhibition as an antitumor drug target was
suggested by extensive work with rapamycin in various
preclinical tumor models.
Whereas the activity of mTOR is regulated tightly
in normal cells, mTOR is activated aberrantly in many
tumors.8 During tumorigenesis and malignant progression, mTOR activity may be increased by multiple signaling pathways, including the phosphoinositide 30
kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt), epidermal growth
factor, and Ras/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase
pathways, which are activated by overexpressed growth
factors or mutations in upstream signaling molecules.8,12-15 Activated mTOR phosphorylates the translation-regulating factors ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1)
and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1
(4EBP-1), enhancing the translation of proteins that
increase cell size, proliferation, and cell survival.16,17
Among the proteins affected by mTOR is hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1a), which is a transcription factor
that facilitates expression of genes needed for tumor cell

growth in a hypoxic microenvironment, including the
angiogenic molecule VEGF.18-20
Most RCC tumors exhibit dysfunctional signaling
pathways that either increase the activity of mTOR or
depend on mTOR activity for their pathology.21 The
Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene, which targets HIF-1a
for degradation by the proteosome, is mutated or silenced
in up to 75% of sporadic clear cell RCCs.22,23 In such
tumors, the increased level of HIF-1a plays a critical oncogenic role, including stimulation of VEGF transcription.18,24 Activated mTOR exacerbates the loss of VHL
function by further elevating HIF-1a through increased
translation. In a murine xenograft model, VHL-deficient
RCC tumors exhibited increased uptake of the positron
emission tomography tracer fluorodeoxyglucose in an
mTOR-dependent manner compared with wild-type
VHL tumors.25 This increased uptake presumably was
caused by increased levels of HIF-1a, which resulted in
increased synthesis of a glucose transport protein. In this
model, tumors with higher HIF-1a levels were more sensitive to mTOR inhibition than tumors with lower HIF1a levels. Because unregulated angiogenesis is a prominent feature of RCC, the inhibition of mTOR is relevant
clinically and may inhibit angiogenesis through a mechanistic approach that differs from that of VEGFR-targeted
agents.26
The loss or inactivation of phosphatase and tensin
homolog (PTEN), which stimulates mTOR through
enhancement of the PI3K/Akt pathway, also occurs frequently in RCC and is a prognostic indicator of poor survival.27,28 For patients with RCC who undergo
nephrectomy, a retrospective analysis of specific biomarkers of the mTOR pathway and disease-specific survival indicated that PTEN, p27, phosphorylated Akt
(phospho-Akt), and phospho-S6K1 ribosomal protein
may predict prognosis and serve as surrogate parameters
for the selection of candidates for treatment with mTOR
inhibitor therapy.29

Development of Novel mTOR Inhibitors
in Oncology
Although oral rapamycin was approved in 1999 for prophylaxis of organ rejection in renal transplantation recipients, formulation and stability issues, as well as its
immunosuppressive activity, prevented its development as
3619

FIGURE 1. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) network.7-9 mTOR is a central component of the phosphoinositide 30
kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway that mediates eukaryotic cell growth and proliferation. The mTOR kinase is
the catalytic component of 2 distinct multiprotein complexes called mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2. mTORC1 also
contains raptor, MLST8, and praline-rich Akt substrate 40 (PRAS40) (a repressor). In tumor cells, mTORC1 activity is aberrantly
elevated. Diverse positive and negative growth signals influence the activity level of mTORC1, many of which converge upon the
tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1)/TSC2 complex and Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb). PI3K receives activating signals
from growth factor receptors or it may be activated constitutively in some tumors. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)
reverses the action of PI3K and functions as a tumor suppressor. Akt also promotes mTORC1 activity by phosphorylating TSC1/
TSC2 and PRAS40, resulting in guanosine-50 -triphosphate (GTP) loading of Rheb and suppression of the PRAS40 repressor.
Downstream, mTORC1 phosphorylates the 70 kd ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) (activation) and eukaryotic translation
initiation factor 4E binding protein (4EBP-1) (inhibition of negative regulator) to increase messenger RNA translation of specific
proteins. mTOR-regulated proteins include D-type cyclins and c-Myc (which increase cell proliferation), hypoxia-inducible factor1a (HIF-1a) (which increases synthesis of the proangiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]), various glycolytic
enzymes, and growth factors (which can promote cell survival). Activation and inhibition induced by direct phosphorylation at
1 or more sites is indicated by a phosphate (P). The mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin, temsirolimus, everolimus, deforolimus) inhibit
mTORC1 by first binding to the intracellular protein FK506 binding protein 1A, 12 kDa (FKBP12); the resultant mTOR inhibitorFKBP12 complex then binds mTOR, blocking mTORC1 to inhibit its kinase activity. Through the specific inhibition of mTORC1
activity, the mTOR inhibitors display a multifunctional biologic activity profile, blocking cell proliferation, cell growth, cell survival,
and angiogenesis in preclinical tumor models. MAPK indicates mitogen-activated protein kinase; S6RP, S6 ribosomal protein.

a parenteral formulation, which was considered essential
for oncology indications at that time.30 Because of promising preclinical data with rapamycin in tumor cell models, several soluble ester analogs of rapamycin were
designed to have improved bioavailability and formulations for the treatment of cancer patients. Temsirolimus
(Torisel; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Philadelphia, Pa),
an intravenous (iv) mTOR inhibitor, is the first mTOR
inhibitor with an oncology indication and is approved for
treatment of patients with advanced RCC.31 Everolimus
(Afinitor; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ),
an oral mTOR inhibitor, initially was developed in the
organ transplantation setting, but appropriate dosing was
established for patients with RCC, and benefit recently
was demonstrated in patients with metastatic RCC whose
disease had progressed on VEGF-targeted therapy.6 A
third rapamycin analog, deforolimus (AP23573; Ariad
Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Mass) initially was developed as an iv formulation that exhibited antitumor activity in phase 1 and 2 trials in patients with advanced solid
and hematologic malignancies.32,33 An oral formulation
of deforolimus subsequently was developed, and an active
dose, which was defined in a phase 1 trial,34 is being evaluated further in the maintenance setting in a global phase
3 trial for patients with metastatic sarcoma.
Rapamycin and the rapamycin analogs inhibit
mTOR by binding to a 12-kilodalton (kDa) cytosolic
immunophilin receptor called FK506 binding protein
1A, 12 kDa (FKBP-12) (Fig. 1).7,9,10 The resulting drug,
FKBP-12 complex, then inhibits the serine/threonine kinase activity of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), which is
composed of mTOR and several regulatory proteins.
Emerging data indicate that malignant transformation
may induce cells to become hypersensitive to mTORC1
inhibition.7 Rapamycin, temsirolimus, everolimus, and
deforolimus are all highly specific, potent inhibitors of
mTORC1. A second mTOR complex, mTORC2, which
directly phosphorylates Akt and is insensitive to inhibition
by these agents, may represent a potential resistance
mechanism.7,10,35
Temsirolimus is a novel functional ester of sirolimus
(rapamycin). Although its major metabolite in humans is
sirolimus, temsirolimus is not a prodrug, because both
temsirolimus and sirolimus have inherent mTOR inhibitor activity. Intravenous temsirolimus results in high peak
exposures than can be attained after oral treatment, leadCancer

ing to a greater level of tumor penetration. The long halflife of sirolimus contributes to the sustained mTOR inhibitory activity observed with temsirolimus treatment. In
contrast, oral dosing with rapamycin or rapamycin analogs results in sustained but lower peak exposure levels.
Preclinical data indicate that inhibition of tumor growth
through mTOR inhibition is biphasic, with antitumor activity observed at both nanomolar and higher (micromolar) concentrations.36,37
mTOR Inhibitors in Advanced RCC: Clinical
Trial Review
Temsirolimus was the first mTOR inhibitor to demonstrate clinical benefit in patients with advanced RCC.5
Among previously untreated patients with poor-risk factors, treatment with temsirolimus resulted in a significant
improvement in overall survival (P Â¼ .008) and progression-free survival (P < .001) compared with IFN.5 It was
demonstrated recently that everolimus prolonged progression-free survival compared with placebo (P < .0001)
when it was given for disease progression after treatment
with VEGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors.6 A summary of
the completed and current phase 2 and 3 clinical trials
with mTOR inhibitors in patients with RCC is provided
in Table 1. Taken together, these studies provide clinical
validation for mTOR as an important pathway in the pathology of RCC and establish the value of mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of this disease in a variety of
settings. The versatility of mTOR inhibitors for RCC and
for multiple other tumor types is being investigated.
Temsirolimus

Phase 1 and pharmacokinetic studies of iv temsirolimus in patients with advanced malignancies have evaluated various schedules and doses, which initially were
adjusted for body surface area.38,39 In 1 of those studies,
iv temsirolimus was tested over a wide range of doses (7.5220 mg/m2) when given as a weekly, 30-minute infusion.38 The most frequent drug-related toxicities were
rash and mucositis. There was no evidence of immunosuppression. Pharmacokinetic evaluation indicated that
sirolimus was a major metabolite, and exposure was
deemed to be the sum of exposures to temsirolimus and
sirolimus. When exposure levels were analyzed, temsirolimus doses normalized for body surface area had variability

similar to flat dose levels.40 Therefore, flat dosing was
used for subsequent studies.
A phase 2 study of temsirolimus in patients with
cytokine-refractory RCC investigated the efficacy and
safety of 3 dose levels (25 mg, 75 mg, or 250 mg) given
once weekly as a 30-minute iv infusion.40 Promising antitumor activity was observed for all dose levels that were
tested, and neither efficacy nor toxicity was affected significantly by dose level. The 25-mg dose ultimately was
selected as the monotherapy dose for further study,
because it was the best tolerated and required the fewest
dose reductions and interruptions. Retrospective analysis
of overall survival in that study indicated that temsirolimus treatment was associated with a 1.6-fold to 1.7-fold
longer median overall survival for patients in the intermediate and poor Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
(MSKCC) prognostic groups41 relative to historic data
for patients who received first-line treatment with IFN.40
Although caution is needed when comparing different
patient populations with different treatment histories, the
analysis raised the possibility that mTOR inhibition may
be beneficial for patients with RCC and poor-risk features, a subset of patients for whom existing therapy
options, including IFN, were inadequate.
The phase 3 randomized global advanced RCC trial
compared IFN, temsirolimus, and the combination of
these agents in previously untreated patients with
advanced RCC who had at least 3 of 6 poor-prognostic
features (5 MSKCC poor-risk factors41 plus multiple
organ sites of metastasis).5 The doses of temsirolimus and
IFN used in the combination arm were determined in a
phase 1 dose-escalation study in patients with advanced
RCC. In the phase 1 study, the recommended dose had
an acceptable safety profile and antitumor activity.42
In the phase 3 trial, once-weekly, iv temsirolimus
25 mg prolonged the median overall survival of patients
with poor prognostic features by 49%, from 7.3 months
(95% confidence interval [95% CI], 6.1 months-8.8
months) in the IFN arm to 10.9 months (95% CI, 8.6
months-12.7 months) in the single-agent temsirolimus
arm (Fig. 2A).5 The hazard ratio for temsirolimus versus
IFN was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.58-0.92; P Â¼ .008), indicating
that temsirolimus treatment significantly reduced the risk
of death. Single-agent temsirolimus also extended median
progression-free survival by 77%, from 3.1 months (95%
CI, 2.2 months-3.8 months) in the IFN arm to 5.5

months (95% CI, 3.9 months-7.0 months; P < .001) in
the temsirolimus arm (Fig. 2B).5 The clinical benefit rate
(objective response or stable disease for at least 24 weeks)
was 32.1% in the temsirolimus group and 15.5% in the
IFN group (P < .001). Exploratory analyses indicated that
the overall and progression-free survival benefits of temsirolimus were observed regardless of tumor histology (clear
cell vs other histologies, defined as indeterminate [12%] or
nonclear cell [6%], including papillary and collecting duct)
or the patientâ€™s nephrectomy status (Table 2).43,44 The tumor histology analysis was based on primary cell type,
which was designated for 99% of patients in the phase 3
study.43 However, information on secondary cell types or
mixed components was not specifically collected.
Temsirolimus appears to be effective for both clear
cell and nonclear cell histologies and, thus, can be used for
the treatment of all types of RCC. Reasons for the pronounced activity of temsirolimus in tumors with histopathologies other than clear cell are not known but may be
explained, in part, by the finding that some nonclear cell
tumors exhibit highly activated mTOR pathways, even in
the presence of normal VHL function.29
For patients in the combination arm, the median
progression-free survival was prolonged by 52% compared with IFN. The median progression-free survival
for patients in the combination arm was 4.7 months
(95% CI, 3.9 months -5.8 months).5 The median overall
survival in the combination arm was 8.4 months (95%
CI, 6.6 months-10.3 months). However, a statistically
significant improvement in overall survival was not
obtained with the combination relative to IFN. This may
be because of the lower temsirolimus dose used (15 mg
compared with 25 mg for single-agent temsirolimus)
and/or the higher frequency of dose delays and dose
reductions required with the combination treatment.
Also, the lower dose of IFN in the combination arm may
have been suboptimal for patients in the intermediaterisk and poor-risk groups. Although dose dependence
was not observed in the phase 2 trial at temsirolimus
doses in the 25-mg to 250-mg range,40 dose dependence
is possible at doses <25 mg. Therefore, temsirolimus
doses in patients with RCC should not be reduced to levels <15 mg.31
The adverse events associated with iv temsirolimus
in patients with advanced RCC were consistent in the
phase 2 and phase 3 trials.5,40 Asthenia, mucositis,

Everolimus

Everolimus is an orally administered inhibitor of
mTOR that has significant immunosuppressant activity
and is approved for use in the organ transplantation setting. Recently this agent demonstrated promising antitumor activity in previously treated patients with
predominantly clear cell, metastatic RCC who had
received no more than 1 previous therapy.48 On the basis of recommended dosing for patients with advanced
cancers that was established in phase 1 studies,49-51
everolimus was administered orally at a dose of 10 mg
daily without interruption (28-day cycle) with dose
modifications allowed for toxicity. Among 37 evaluable
patients, 5 patients (14%) had a partial response, and
27 patients (73%) had stable disease for at least 3
months.48
Cancer

Results recently were reported from a randomized
phase 3 trial of everolimus 10 mg daily (n Â¼ 272) versus
placebo (n Â¼ 138) in patients who had metastatic RCC
with a clear cell component after progression on VEGFRtyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy (sunitinib, 45%; sorafenib, 29%; both sunitinib and sorafenib, 26%).6 That
study enrolled patients from all MSKCC risk groups, and
other prior systemic treatments included IFN (51%),
interleukin-2 (23%), chemotherapy (14%), and bevacizumab (9%). A planned interim analysis revealed that the
progression-free survival data met the prespecified criteria
for a positive trial, and the Independent Data Monitoring
Committee stopped the study to allow patients who
remained on placebo to cross over and receive everolimus.
Treatment with everolimus in patients with RCC after failure on VEGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy
resulted in a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival compared with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.22-0.40; P < .0001), as assessed by
independent review (Fig. 3).6 The median progressionfree interval was 4.0 months (95% CI, 3.7 months-5.5

pneumonitis (all 3% vs 0%).6 Of the 8 patients who had
grade 3 pneumonitis, 6 discontinued everolimus treatment. Complete clinical resolution was observed in
4 patients, and 3 patients had improvement to grade 2.
Therefore, it was established that everolimus had an acceptable and manageable safety profile for patients with
metastatic RCC after progression on VEGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.

In a dose-escalation phase 1 trial of deforolimus
administered as a 30-minute iv infusion once daily for
5 consecutive days every 2 weeks, encouraging antitumor
activity was observed across a broad range of advanced tumor types, including RCC and sarcoma.32 Among the
32 patients in that early study, all of the 7 patients who
had advanced RCC experienced a partial response, minimal response, or stable disease for 3 months. Reversible
mouth sores (78%) and rash (66%) were the most frequently encountered treatment-related adverse events,
there were no events suggestive of relevant immunosuppression, and pneumonitis developed in 5 patients.
Because of the promising antitumor activity and manageable safety profile, deforolimus is being developed further
in disease-focused clinical trials.

Continuing Evolution of mTOR Inhibitors
in RCC
The strong clinical data with mTOR inhibitors has
impacted evidence-based treatment guidelines for both
treatment-naive and previously treated patients with
RCC. Among patients who have not received previous
systemic treatment, the selection of treatment may be
guided by prognostic risk. The evidence recommends
temsirolimus 25 mg administered as a once-weekly, iv
infusion for those with poor-risk features, whereas either
sunitinib or bevacizumab plus IFN is recommended for
good-risk and intermediate-risk patients with clear cell
RCC.2,4,5 Among previously treated patients, the use of
oral everolimus 10 mg daily is supported by phase 3 data
in patients with RCC after failure of VEGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.6 Evidence-based treatment guidelines are being modified to incorporate these data. For
cytokine-refractory patients, sorafenib continues to be recommended.3 Currently, to our knowledge, there are no
pivotal data for the treatment of patients who develop
recurrent disease after receiving an mTOR inhibitor as
first-line therapy.
The benefits of mTOR inhibition in the second-line
setting are being explored further in an international
randomized phase 3 trial of temsirolimus compared with
sorafenib in sunitinib-refractory patients. In that trial, sorafenib is an active comparator rather than the placebo
comparator that was used in the everolimus phase 3 trial.

y Independent assessment.
z P values for subgroup analyses were based on unstratified log-rank tests.

Patients enrolled in the study are stratified according to
nephrectomy status, duration of response to sunitinib
therapy, tumor histology, and MSKCC risk group. Primary endpoints are progression-free survival and safety
and tolerability.
Various combination regimens that include mTOR
inhibitors also are being explored in patients with solid
tumors, including RCC. For example, results have been
reported for phase 1 dosing studies of temsirolimus or
everolimus in combination with sorafenib, bevacizumab,
erlotinib, gefitinib, or imatinib.52-57 Overall, acceptable
tolerability has been observed with mTOR inhibitors
combined with other agents. One exception was reported
in a phase 1 dose-escalation study of sunitinib plus temsirolimus, which indicated that this combination was
poorly tolerated in patients with advanced RCC, even at
the lowest dose level of temsirolimus.58 A large randomized phase 3 trial (Investigation of Torisel and Avastin
Combination Therapy; INTORACT) is evaluating the
efficacy and safety of the combination of temsirolimus
plus bevacizumab versus bevacizumab plus IFN as firstline treatment in patients with advanced RCC (Table 1).
That trial is being conducted at approximately 200 sites
worldwide and will enroll approximately 800 patients.
The primary endpoint is the comparison of independently assessed progression-free survival.
Studies of mTOR Inhibitors in Multiple
Tumor Types
Because mTOR is an important therapeutic target for
malignancies other than RCC, mTOR inhibitors are
Cancer

being studied in a variety of tumor types. Among hematologic malignancies, mantle cell lymphoma is characterized
by an 11;14 translocation that leads to the overexpression
of cyclin D1 mRNA. In 2 North Central Cancer Treatment Group phase 2 studies, temsirolimus had promising
activity in patients with recurrent/refractory mantle cell
lymphoma.59,60 A recent randomized phase 3 trial of iv
temsirolimus 175 mg administered once weekly for 3
weeks followed by 75 mg once weekly61 demonstrated significantly increased progression-free survival (P Â¼ .0009)
and objective response rates (P Â¼ .0019) in patients with
recurrent and/or refractory mantle cell lymphoma compared with the investigatorâ€™s choice of therapy from prospectively approved options. Antitumor activity was also
observed with temsirolimus in non-Hodgkin lymphoma
subtypes other than mantle cell lymphoma62 and in multiple myeloma.63 Everolimus and deforolimus have also
shown antitumor activity in various hematologic malignancies.33,64,65 Collectively, these results indicate potential for mTOR inhibition as a novel treatment strategy for
various hematologic malignancies.
Currently, there are more than 100 ongoing trials of
mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of various advanced
solid malignancies.66 Similar to RCC, the challenges for
these and future trials of mTOR inhibitors include understanding the best ways to use these novel targeted therapies within each tumor type and to identify which
patients are most likely to benefit from mTOR inhibitor
therapy.
In conclusion, the importance of mTOR as a novel
targeted mechanism in the treatment of advanced RCC
3627

Review Article

has been clearly validated in phase 3 clinical trials, both as
first-line treatment and as second-line treatment in
VEGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor failures. The mTOR
inhibitors temsirolimus and everolimus are tolerated reasonably well by patients with advanced RCC, and most
adverse events can be managed medically or with supportive measures; an exception is pneumonitis, which may
occur in patients who are treated with mTOR inhibitors.
Both agents commonly are associated with elevated blood
sugar and lipid levels, consistent with the roles of mTOR
in glucose and lipid metabolism. mTOR inhibitors continue to be investigated in RCC, mantle cell lymphoma,
and multiple other malignancies.
