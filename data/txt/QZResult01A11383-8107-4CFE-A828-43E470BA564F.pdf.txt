ABSTRACT:
Genetic alterations activating K-RAS and PI3K/AKT signaling are also known to
induce the activity of mTOR kinase through TORC1 and TORC2 complexes in human
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Here, we determined the effects of the dual
PI3K and mTOR inhibitor, NVP-BEZ235 (BEZ235), and the pan-histone deacetylase
inhibitor panobinostat (PS) against human PDAC cells. Treatment with BEZ235 or PS
inhibited cell cycle progression with induction of the cell cycle inhibitory proteins,
p21waf1 and p27kip1. BEZ235 and PS also dose dependently induced loss of cell viability
of the cultured PDAC cells, associated with depletion of phosphorylated (p) AKT, as
well as of the TORC1 substrates 4EBP1 and p70S6 kinase. While inhibiting p-AKT,
treatment with PS induced the levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins BIM and BAK.
Co-treatment with BEZ235 and PS synergistically induced apoptosis of the cultured
PDAC cells. This was accompanied by marked attenuation of the levels of p-AKT and
Bcl-xL but induction of BIM. Although in vivo treatment with BEZ235 or PS reduced
tumor growth, co-treatment with BEZ235 and PS was significantly more effective in
controlling the xenograft growth of Panc1 PDAC cells in the nude mice. Furthermore,
co-treatment with BEZ235 and PS more effectively blocked tumor growth of primary
PDAC heterotransplants (possessing K-RAS mutation and AKT2 amplification)
subcutaneously implanted in the nude mice than each agent alone. These findings
demonstrate superior activity and support further in vivo evaluation of combined
treatment with BEZ235 and PS against PDAC that possess heightened activity of RASRAF-ERK1/2 and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways.

INTRODUCTION

p16 (95%) and SMAD4 (50%) [3]. In addition, AKT2
(10-20%) amplification and mutations in PTEN, BRAF,
STK11 (LKB1) and BRCA2 have been reported in a
smaller percentage of PDAC [2, 3]. Activating mutation
in K-RAS increases RAS-RAF-ERK1/2 activity, which
is known to promote growth and survival of PDAC [2,
3]. K-RAS mutation may also cause aberrant activation
of other intracellular signaling pathways, including the
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT/mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway [4].

Advanced
exocrine
pancreatic
ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal disease with a
survival rate of less than 5% [1]. PDAC is a highly
aneuploid cancer, associated with not only significant
alterations in the copy numbers of several genes but
also with a successive accumulation of gene mutations
[2, 3]. Among the genes that are mutated in pancreatic
cancer are K-RAS (90%), TP53/p53 (50-75%), CDKN2A/

In addition, activating mutations in PI3K or AKT2
amplification, or the loss of PTEN phosphatase activity,
individually have been documented to augment PI3KAKT-mTOR activity, which also promotes the growth
and survival of PDAC [2-5]. Singly or in a combinatorial
manner, these genetic alterations may contribute to the
aggressive nature of the PDAC and confer resistance to
the conventional and targeted agents [2, 6, 7].
AKT is a serine/threonine protein kinase, which
is activated by phosphorylation at T308 by PI3K-PDK1
and at S473 residue by mTOR kinase associated with the
TORC2 complex [8, 9]. AKT is known to phosphorylate

FOXO3A, thereby inhibiting transcriptional activation of
the pro-apoptotic proteins BIM and p27 [9, 10]. AKT also
phosphorylates BAD, BIM and caspase-9, which leads
to inhibition of apoptosis [8]. Through crosstalk with
other signaling pathways, including, WNT, NFκB and
MAPK, AKT activity also promotes tumor cell growth
by up-regulating Myc and Cyclin D1 [4, 10]. AKT also
activates the serine/threonine kinase activity of mTOR
kinase, which is the active component of two multiprotein complexes, TORC1 and TORC2 [11, 12]. AKT
also phosphorylates the proline-rich AKT substrate of 40
kDa (PRAS40) causing its detachment from the TORC1

complex, which it inhibits. Thus, AKT activates TORC1
in a PRAS40-dependent manner [4,11]. In addition, AKTmediated phosphorylation also shuts down the GTPase
activating protein (GAP) activity of TSC2-TSC1 for
RHEB, whereby GTP-bound RHEB activates TORC1
[13]. Thus, AKT activity potentially activates TORC1 by
two separate mechanisms. TORC1 directly phosphorylates
the eukaryotic translational initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)binding protein (4EBP1) and S6 kinase1 (S6K1), which
promotes protein synthesis in PDAC cells [9, 11, 13].
TORC1-mediated phosphorylation of 4EBP1 inhibits its
binding to eIF4E, thereby allowing eIF4E to participate
in the formation of eIF4F complex. This complex enables
cap-dependent protein translation of pro-growth (Myc
and Cyclin D1) and pro-survival proteins (e.g., MCL1 and Bcl-xL) [4, 14, 15]. Loss of 4EBP1 was shown to

increase tumorigenesis due to p53 inactivation, whereas
an increase in 4EBP1 activity inhibited tumors driven by
co-expression of mutant KRAS and PI3K [16, 17]. This
created a compelling rationale to use mTOR inhibitors
such as rapamycin or related ‘rapalogs’ against PDAC
[18, 19]. Rapamycin and ‘rapalogs’ inhibit mTOR by
allosterically inhibiting TORC1 but not TORC2 [20,
21]. It is the TORC2 complex-associated mTOR that
phosphorylates AKT on the S473 residue, promoting its
activity, which is uninhibited by rapamycin [9, 11, 22]. In
addition, rapamycin has been shown to only incompletely
inhibit 4EBP1 phosphorylation, leaving the rapamycinresistant TORC1 mediated phosphorylation of 4EBP1 uninhibited [20, 22]. In addition, recent reports have shown
that several negative feedback loops limit the therapeutic
efficacy of ‘rapalogs’ [20, 22]. TORC1 either directly

or through activation of S6K1 phosphorylates IRS1,
which promotes its degradation, thereby reducing the
growth factor signaling downstream of receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs) mediated through the PI3K-PDK1-AKT
axis [11]. Recently, TORC1 was also shown to directly
phosphorylate and stabilize GRB10, which negatively
regulates the growth factor signaling through RTKs
and the PI3K-PDK1-AKT axis [23, 24]. Therefore, the
activity of rapamycin and related ‘rapalogs’ is impaired
by the negative feedback loop that activates AKT through
TORC1 inhibition, which promotes growth and survival
of PDAC [22, 25].
NVP-BEZ235 is an orally bioavailable

imidazoquinoline derivative that binds to the ATP-binding
clefts of the class I PI3K and mTOR kinase, leading to
inhibition of PI3K, as well as attenuation of TORC1 and
TORC2 activity [26, 27]. By inhibiting PI3K, and TORC2,
treatment with BEZ235 abrogates the feedback activation
of AKT, as well as mediates more complete inhibition of
4EBP1 phosphorylation [28]. Based on this, BEZ235 has
been documented to be active against transformed cells
with increased activity of PI3K-AKT-TORC1, which
results due to PIK3CA mutation, PIK3R1 mutation, PTEN
loss, RTK dependent activation or AKT amplification [10,
28]. BEZ235 has been shown to exert G0/G1 cell cycle
arrest and anti-proliferative responses in a variety of

cancer cell types [26-30]. Recently, it was reported that
treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)
with BEZ235 resulted in regression of PIK3CA-mutated
but not K-RAS-mutated tumors [31]. However, combined
administration of BEZ235 with MEK1 inhibitor resulted
in significant regression of K-RAS-mutated NSCLC
tumors [31]. Treatment with pan-histone deacetylase
inhibitors such as panobinostat (PS) has been documented
to induce hyperacetylation and inhibition of the chaperone
function of hsp90 [32]. This was shown to cause the
misfolding, polyubiquitylation and degradation of hsp90chaperoned client proteins, e.g., c-RAF, which inhibits the
downstream signaling through MEK-ERK1/2 [32, 33].
In addition, HDAC inhibitor treatment leads to inhibition
of cell cycle progression, as well as lowers the threshold
for apoptosis by inducing pro-death, e.g. BAX, BAK, and
BIM, and attenuating pro-survival proteins, e.g., Bcl-xL,
MCL-1 and XIAP, through multiple mechanisms [34-36].
PS has also been shown to exhibit in vitro and in vivo antiPDAC activity [37]. Therefore, collectively based on these
observations, in present studies, we determined the in
vitro and in vivo effects of BEZ235 and PS against human
PDAC cells expressing mutant K-RAS and exhibiting
increased activity of PI3K-AKT-mTOR axis. Our findings
show that as compared to treatment with each agent alone,
co-treatment with BEZ235 and PS synergistically induces
apoptosis of PDAC cells and exerts superior in vivo
activity in PDAC cell xenografts in the nude mice.

BEZ235 and PS in the cultured PDAC Panc1 cells. As
shown in Figure 1A, exposure to 250 nM of BEZ235 for
24 hours markedly increased the accumulation of Panc1
cells in the G0/G1 phase with decline in the % of cells
in the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle. No further
increase in this effect on cell cycle was observed at higher
concentrations of BEZ235 (data not shown). Treatment
with PS (50 nM for 24 hours) also increased the % of
cells in G0/G1 phase and mediated a decline in the G2/M
phase of the cell cycle (Figure 1A). The effects of PS and
BEZ235 on the cell cycle were associated with a marked
increase in the levels of the cell cycle inhibitory protein
p21waf but a more modest increase in p27kip1 levels in Panc1
cells (Figure 1B). Similar findings were also observed in
Hs766T cells (data not shown). Figure 1C shows that a 48
hour exposure to PS or BEZ235 dose-dependently reduced
the cell viability of each of the four cultured PDAC cell
types, with the greatest effect seen in MIA PaCa-2 and the
least effect in Hs766T cells.
Effects of BEZ235 and PS treatment on PI3K/
mTOR signaling in pancreatic cancer cells. We next
determined the effects of treatment with BEZ235 on
the key TORC1 and TORC2 substrates in Hs766T
and Panc1 cells. Exposure to 250 nM of BEZ235 for
24 hours markedly depleted the levels of the TORC1
substrates p-4EBP1 (Thr37/46) and p-p70S6K (Thr389)
and reduced the levels of the TORC2 substrate p-AKT
(Ser473) (Figure 2A). Lower concentrations of BEZ235
mediated less pronounced effects on TORC1 and TORC2
substrates. There was also no significant effect of BEZ235
on the levels of BAX, BAK, or MCL-1 in the PDAC cells
(Figure 2A). As previous studies have documented that
treatment with PS reduces the levels of p-AKT (Ser473)
and inhibits TORC1 activity in other tumor cell types

depleted TORC1 and TORC2 activity in PDAC cells. As

and class IIB (HDAC6) HDACs (Figure 2B). Treatment
with PS only modestly depleted the levels of p-4EBP1
(Thr37/46), p-p70S6K (Thr389) and p-AKT (Ser473) in
Panc1 and Hs766T cells (Figure 2B and Supplemental
Figure S2). PS treatment also induced BIM and BAK, but
reduced the levels of Bcl-xL and MCL-1, consistent with
its ability to induce apoptosis in PDAC cells (Figure 2B &
3A and Supplemental Figure S2).
Co-treatment with PS and BEZ235 synergistically
induces apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells. We next
determined the effects of combined treatment with
BEZ235 and PS in Hs766T and Panc1 cells. Figure 3A
shows that, compared to treatment with either agent alone,
co-treatment with BEZ235 and PS induced significantly
more apoptosis of Hs766T and Panc1 cells (p <0.05).
Furthermore, median dose effect and isobologram
analyses performed utilizing Calcusyn software showed
that co-treatment with BEZ235 and PS synergistically
induced apoptosis of Hs766T and Panc1 cells (Figure
3 B-C). We also compared the effects of combined
treatment with BEZ235 and PS to treatment with each
agent alone on AKT, TORC1 and TORC2 activity in
the cultured PDAC cells. As shown in Figure 4A, in
the PDAC cells, co-treatment with BEZ235 and PS was
more active in depleting the levels of p-AKT (Ser473),
p-p70S6K (Thr389), and p-4EBP1 (Thr37/46) than
treatment with each agent alone. Next, we determined
the effects of BEZ235 and PS on the levels of selective
apoptosis regulators in PDAC cells. Figure 4B shows that
co-treatment with BEZ235 and PS was more effective in
inducing BIMEL, BIML and BIMS in the PDAC cells. In
addition, following treatment with the combination of
BEZ235 and PS, a greater decline in Bcl-xL and c-Myc
levels was also observed (Figure 4B).
In vivo anti-tumor activity of BEZ235 and/or PS
against PDAC xenografts in mice. Next, we determined
the effect of treatment with BEZ235 and/or PS on the
growth of established (> 100 mm3) tumor xenografts of
Panc1 cells subcutaneously implanted in the flanks of
nude mice. As shown in Figure 5A, compared to control
treatment (vehicle alone), a three week treatment with
BEZ235 or PS alone significantly reduced tumor growth,
resulting in lower mean tumor volume of the Panc1 tumors
(p < 0.01). Notably, combined treatment with BEZ235
and PS completely abrogated the growth of Panc1 tumor
xenografts, an effect significantly superior to treatment
with BEZ235 or PS as a single agent (p< 0.05) (Figure 5A).
We also determined the anti-tumor activity of BEZ235
and/or PS against tumor growth of subcutaneously
implanted primary PDAC heterotransplants (possessing
K-RAS mutation and AKT2 amplification) in the nude
mice. As shown in Figure 5B, treatment with either
BEZ235 or PS significantly reduced tumor growth of the
heterotransplanted PDAC tumors (p < 0.01). BEZ235
exerted a slightly superior, but not statistically significant,
anti-tumor effect on the growth of the heterotransplants in

the nude mice (p > 0.05). Importantly, co-treatment with
the two agents was significantly more effective in reducing
the growth of the heterotransplanted tumors, resulting in
lower mean tumor volume, as compared to treatment with
either BEZ235 or PS (Figure 5B) (p < 0.05). At the doses
that were used in both models, neither single agent nor
the combination of BEZ235 and PS caused weight loss or
other toxicity to the mice.

PDAC cells, which was associated with reduced levels of
p-AKT and modest induction of BIM in the PDAC cells
[29, 30]. In contrast, treatment with PS alone induced
BIM and BAK, while simultaneously reducing MCL-1
and Bcl-xL levels in the PDAC cells. Collectively, these
effects of PS would lower the threshold for apoptosis
and provide an explanation for why co-treatment with
PS significantly enhanced BEZ235-induced apoptosis
of the PDAC cells. Recent reports have highlighted
superior anti-tumor activity of the combinations of
dual PI3K-AKT-mTOR inhibitors with MEK-ERK1/2
inhibitors against tumors that express mutant K-RAS and
exhibit increased activity of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway
(Figure 6) [31, 45]. In present study, treatment with PS
attenuated p-ERK1/2 levels (Supplemental Figure 2),
thereby effectively functioning as an inhibitor of MEKERK1/2. It is well documented that ERK1/2 activity
phosphorylates and reduces BIM levels, and inhibition of
ERK1/2 induces BIM and promotes apoptosis (Figure 6)
[46]. In the present studies, inhibition of AKT following
co-treatment with BEZ235 and PS may also be promoting
BIM induction by inhibiting phosphorylation of FOXO3A,
thereby increasing FOXO3A levels in the nucleus leading
to transcriptional up regulation of BIM and p27 (Figure
6) [47]. Induction of p27 due to PS treatment may also
explain synergistic anti-tumor effects of co-treatment with
PS and BEZ235; since a previous report has documented
that the levels of p27 positively correlate with and
sensitize cancer cells to BEZ235 treatment [48].
Co-treatment with BEZ235 and PS also caused
marked reduction in p-AKT (Ser473) levels, abolishing
the feedback activation of PI3K-AKT due to TORC1
inhibition, while maintaining marked attenuation of
p-S6K1 (Thr389) and p-4EBP1 (Thr37/46) levels caused
by depletion of TORC1 activity (Figure 6). TORC1mediated phosphorylation of 4EBP1, and the resulting
increased activity of eIF4E, appears to be a key regulator
of proliferation and survival of transformed cells by
causing up regulation of Myc, cyclin D1 and MCL1 (Figure 6) [9]. Consequently, marked depletion of
p-4EBP1 (Thr37/46) levels by combined treatment with
PS and BEZ235 would inhibit growth and survival of
PDAC cells, even of cells expressing mutant K-RAS
and high PI3K-AKT-mTOR activity. Conversely, it
is conceivable that MYC and eIF4E amplification in
tumors may confer resistance against a BEZ235-based
combination therapy [49].
Notably, a previous report showed that expression
of non-phosphorylatable, constitutively active 4EBP1
suppressed growth of tumors driven by mutations in
both PI3K and K-RAS [16]. This explains significantly
greater tumor growth delay in two separate in vivo PDAC
models utilized in present studies, i.e., the subcutaneously
implanted Panc1 xenografts and PDAC heterotransplants
in the nude mice [50]. It should also be noted that
inhibition of TORC1 activity as well as treatment with PS

DISCUSSION
A profiling of the genetic alterations in human PDAC
has shown that simultaneously increased activity of RASRAF-MEK-ERK1/2 and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways is
common [2, 3]. The two pathways interact to regulate each
other, and also co-regulate important downstream targets
(Figure 6) [4]. This promotes not only the growth, survival
and aggressive phenotype of PDAC cells, but also confers
therapeutic resistance to chemotherapeutic agents or even
single pathway-targeted agents [2, 4, 33, 39]. Consistent
with this, previous studies have shown that although there
is modest single agent activity of PI3K-AKT or MEKERK1/2 inhibitor, neither exhibits a meaningful in vivo
tumor regression nor improves survival in PDAC [4042]. Recently, the therapeutic role of targeting mTOR
has also been evaluated in vivo against PDAC xenografts
with increased activity of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway
from patients with advanced PDAC [19, 43]. Although
some xenografts showed tumor regression, in the clinic,
only 13% of patients exhibited stable disease and none
experienced an objective response [19]. In the present
studies we show that treatment with the dual PI3K-mTOR
inhibitor BEZ235 and pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor
PS, when administered alone, exert in vitro and in vivo
antitumor activity against PDAC cells. These findings
confirm other recent reports that have documented the
preclinical single agent activity of PS or BEZ235 against
PDAC cells [29, 37]. Importantly, our findings show,
for the first time, that co-treatment with the two agents
synergistically induces apoptosis and causes in vivo tumor
regression of Panc1 and freshly harvested human PDAC
implanted subcutaneously in the nude mice.
Our results also show that treatment with PS and
BEZ235 induced the expression of p21waf and p27kip1 which
was associated with cell cycle growth arrest of PDAC
cells. This is important because loss of function of p16
and ARF, which in turn can cause loss of p53 function,
is frequent in and promotes cell cycle progression and
growth of PDAC cells [2, 3]. The PDAC cells used here
(Panc1 and Hs766T) are also known to possess genetic
alterations leading to loss of function of p16 and p53
[44]. Consistent with previous reports, our findings also
show that treatment with BEZ235 alone induced cell cycle
growth arrest. This was associated with marked attenuation
of TORC1 and TORC2 activity. Treatment with BEZ235
alone was modestly effective in inducing apoptosis of

has been shown to induce autophagy [43, 51]. In tumors
expressing mutant RAS, autophagy has been shown to
serve as a pro-death mechanism, such that RAS-induced
autophagy led to caspase-independent cell death [52, 53].
Therefore, it is conceivable, although not specifically
evaluated here, that co-treatment with BEZ235 and PS
may lead to accentuated tumor cell stress and autophagy,
leading to the engagement of an autophagic cell death
mechanism and tumor growth inhibition. Furthermore,

TORC1 inhibition by BEZ235 treatment and PS has been
shown to inhibit tumor angiogenesis [29, 54]. Again,
co-treatment with BEZ235 and PS may accentuate this
mechanism and explain the superior in vivo antitumor
activity of the combination in our study. It is clear that
in the future more in depth studies would have to be
performed to determine the pharmacodynamics correlates
of the superior in vivo activity of this combination.

Figure 6: Activity of BEZ235 and PS against the mTOR signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer cells. (1), Upon growth

factor binding to a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), insulin receptor substrate (IRS1) is activated. This stimulates the PI3K and RAS signaling
pathways. (2), Activation of PI3K and RAS results in phosphorylation and increased activity of the effector kinases, AKT and ERK1/2. (3),
Activated AKT and ERK directly phosphorylate and inactivate the tuberous sclerosis (TSC) 1 /TSC2 complex and thus activate mTORC1.
(4), When the TSC1/ TSC2 complex is active, it negatively regulates mTORC1 by converting RAS homolog enriched in brain (RHEB)
from its active GTP-bound state to its inactive GDP-bound state. (5), Similar to AKT, the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein
kinase (AMPK) can directly block the activity of TORC1 by phosphorylation of Raptor, a TORC1 inhibitor, leading to allosteric inhibition
of TORC1. (6), The activated RTK can also directly activate TORC2 which phosphorylates AKT at Ser473 leading to inactivation of the
TSC1/TSC2 complex and activation of TORC1. (7), Activated AKT also signals TORC1 by phosphorylating and inactivating PRAS40.
Inactivating phosphorylation causes PRAS40 to disassociate from Raptor which releases inhibition on TORC1. (8), Activation of TORC1
leads to phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and S6K1 which in turn promote protein synthesis, ribosome biogenesis, cellular growth, proliferation
and survival. (9), When activated by TORC1, S6K1 directly phosphorylates IRS1 leading to degradation of IRS and dampening of growth
factor signaling. (10), In addition, growth factor receptor-bound protein 10 (GRB10) another substrate activated by TORC1 activity reduces
the expression of the growth factor receptors (RTKs). (11), Treatment with BEZ235 inhibits the activity of PI3K, TORC1, and TORC2
resulting in depletion of p-AKT, p-4EBP1, p-p70S6K and cap-dependent translation with concomitant induction of BIM, p27 and p21.
This leads to cell cycle growth inhibition and decreased cell proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells. PS treatment modestly inhibits TORC1
activity leading to depletion of p-4EBP1 and p-p70S6K. PS treatment also inhibits p-AKT leading to nuclear localization of FOXO3A,
which induces expression of p21, p27, and BIM. Combined treatment with BEZ235 and PS causes greater induction of BIM and increased
cell death of pancreatic cancer cells.

Cell viability

TORC1 and TORC2 inhibitor was shown to enhance the
pre-clinical anti-tumor efficacy of a pan-HDAC inhibitor
against primary xenograft models of hepatocellular
carcinoma [38]. Our preclinical in vivo findings presented
here support a compelling rationale for further evaluating
the combination of the dual PI3K-mTOR kinase inhibitor
BEZ235 and PS in the in vivo models of human PDAC
that express mutant K-RAS and increased activity of
PI3K-AKT-mTOR axis.

Cell viability was assayed using a Cell Counting
Kit-8 (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc.) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were treated
with the indicated concentrations of PS and BEZ235 for 48
hours. Water soluble tetrazolium salt (WST-8) was added
and incubated at 37°C for 2 hours and the absorbance was
measured at 450 nm. The percentages of viable cells are
expressed relative to the viability of the untreated control
cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell cycle analysis

Cell culture

The flow cytometric evaluation of cell-cycle status
and the percentage of cells in the G1, S, and G2–M phases
was performed according to a previously described method
[55]. Briefly, after the designated treatments, cells were
harvested and washed twice with 1X phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), then fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at -20°C.
The cells were washed twice with 1X PBS, incubated with
RNase A and propidium iodide for 15 min at 37°C in the
dark. Cell cycle data were collected on a BD Accuri C6
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with a 488 nm laser and
analyzed as previously described [55].

Human pancreatic cancer cell lines Panc1, Hs766T,
MIA PaCa-2 and AsPC-1 were obtained from American
Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were
thawed and cultured for 3-5 passages, then frozen in
aliquots in liquid nitrogen. All experiments with cell
lines were performed within 6 months after thawing or
obtaining from ATCC. Cell line characterization was
performed by ATCC. The ATCC utilizes short tandem
repeat (STR) profiling for characterization of cell lines.
Panc1 and Hs766T cells were maintained in DMEM
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin
streptomycin. MIA PaCa-2 cells were cultured in DMEM
with 10% FBS, 2.5% horse serum and 1% penicillin
streptomycin. AsPC-1 cells were cultured in RPMI with
10% FBS and 1% penicillin streptomycin. Cells were
passaged 2-3 times per week. Logarithmically growing
cells were used for all experiments detailed below. Cells
were washed free of the drugs prior to harvesting for
experimentation.

Cell lysis and protein quantitation
Untreated or drug-treated cells were centrifuged,
washed with 1X PBS and the cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μL lysis buffer and incubated on
ice for 30 minutes, as previously described [32, 55].
After centrifugation, the protein concentration was
quantified using a BCA reagent (Pierce), according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.

Reagents and antibodies

SDS-PAGE and Western blotting

Panobinostat (PS) and BEZ235 (Supplemental
Figure S1: chemical structures of BEZ235 and PS) were

anti-4EBP1, anti-p-p70S6K (Thr389), anti-p70S6K,
anti-p-ERK1/2, anti-ERK1/2, anti-BAK and antiBIM antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology. Anti-acetylated histone H3 antibody was
obtained from Millipore. Anti-Bcl-xL, anti-BAX, antic-Myc, anti-MCL-1 and anti-p21waf were obtained from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-p27kip1 antibody was
obtained from BD Transduction Labs. Anti-β-actin and
anti-acetylated α-tubulin antibodies were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich.

Fifty micrograms of total cell lysate was used for
SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Western
blot analyses were performed on total cell lysates using
specific antisera or monoclonal antibodies as previously
described [55]. After thorough washing in 1X PBST, blots
were incubated in IRDye 680 goat anti-mouse or IRDye
800 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (LI-COR) for
1 hour, washed 3 times in 1X PBST, and scanned with
an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR). The
expression levels of β-actin were used as the loading
control for the immunoblots. Immunoblot analyses
were performed at least twice and representative blots
are presented. Densitometric evaluation of proteins was
performed with Image Quant 5.2 software.

(width2)/2. Growth curves for tumors were plotted as the
mean tumor volume + SEM from each treatment group.

After drug treatments, cells were washed with
1X PBS, resuspended in 100 µL of annexin V staining
solution (containing annexin V-FITC conjugate (BD
Biosciences) and TO-PRO-3 iodide in a HEPES buffer).
Following incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes,
cells were analyzed on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences). Synergism defined as more than
expected additive effect was assessed using the median
dose effect equation of Chou-Talalay (assuming mutual
exclusivity) [56]. The combination index (CI) for each
drug combination was obtained using the commercially
available software Calcusyn (Biosoft, Ferguson, MO). CI
< 1, CI = 1, and CI > 1 represent synergistic, additive or
antagonistic interaction of the two agents, respectively.

Statistical analysis
Significant differences between values obtained
in a population of control and treated pancreatic cancer
cells were determined using the Student’s t test. P values
less than 0.05 were assigned significance. For the in vivo
studies, significant differences in the mean tumor volumes
after three weeks of treatment with BEZ235 and/or PS
were determined using a two-tailed, paired t-test.

Six-week-old female nude mice were purchased
from the Harlan Laboratories, Inc. and were maintained
under specific pathogen-free conditions. All animal
experiments were approved by the IACUC at the Kansas
University Medical Center and adhered to the NIH
Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
For Panc1 xenografts 5 x 106 Panc1 cells were injected
subcutaneously into the right flank of the mice. When
the mean tumor volume reached approximately 100-200
mm3, mice were randomized into one of four treatment
groups: (a) vehicle (5% DMSO), (b) PS (10 mg/kg, i.p.
three times per week), (c) BEZ235 (25 mg/kg, daily
by oral gavage), (d) combination of PS (10 mg/kg)
and BEZ235 (25 mg/kg). PS was prepared fresh in 5%
DMSO. BEZ235 was prepared fresh in 10% NMP/PEG
300 [1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone/polyethylene glycol 300;
10:90, v/v]. General condition of the mice was monitored
daily. Tumors were measured by digital calipers every two
days and tumor volume was calculated using the formula
(length X (width2)/2. AKT-amplified human pancreatic
cancer heterotransplants were kindly provided by Manuel
Hidalgo and Anirban Maitra (Johns Hopkins University)
[19, 30]. Tumor sections (3 x 3 mm) were implanted into
the flank of athymic nude mice and allowed to grow to
1500 mm3. Mice were humanely sacrificed and the tumors
were aseptically harvested, divided, and transplanted into
the flank of an additional 24 mice. Tumors were allowed
to grow until they reached approximately 200-400 mm3.
The mice were then randomized into one of four treatment
groups: (a) vehicle (5% DMSO), (b) PS (10 mg/kg i.p.
three times per week), (c) BEZ235 (25 mg/kg, daily
