HER2/Neu is overexpressed in 20-30% of breast cancers and associated with aggressive
phenotypes and poor prognosis. For deciphering the role of HER2/Neu in breast cancer, mouse
mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-Her2/neu transgenic mice that develop mammary tumors
resembling human HER2-subtype breast cancer have been established. Several recent studies have
revealed that HER2/Neu is overexpressed in and regulates self renewal of breast tumor initiating
cells (TICs). However, in the MMTV-Her2/neu transgenic mouse model, the identity of TICs
remains elusive, despite previous studies showing supportive evidence for existence of TICs in
Her2/neu-induced mammary tumors. Through systematic screening and characterization, we
identified surface markers CD49f, CD61 and ESA were aberrantly overexpressed in Her2overexpressing mammary tumor cells. Analysis of these markers as well as CD24 detected
anomalous expansion of the luminal progenitor population in preneoplastic mammary glands of
Her2/neu-transgenic mice, indicating that aberrant luminal progenitors originated Her2-induced
mammary tumors. The combined markers, CD49f and CD61, further delineated the
CD49fhighCD61high-sorted fraction as a TIC-enriched population, which displayed increased
tumorsphere formation ability, enhanced tumorigenicity both in vitro and in vivo and drug
resistance to pacitaxel and doxorubicin. Moreover, the TIC-enriched population manifested
increased TGFβ signaling and exhibited gene expression signatures of stemness, TGFβ signaling

and Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition. Our findings that self-renewal and clonogenicity of
TICs were suppressed by pharmacologically inhibiting the TGFβ signaling further indicate that the
TGFβ pathway is vital for maintenance of the TIC population. Finally, we showed that the integrin
β3 (CD61) signaling pathway was required for sustaining active TGFβ signaling and self-renewal
of TICs. We for the first time developed a technique to highly enrich TICs from mammary tumors
of Her2/neu-transgenic mice, unraveled their properties and identified the cooperative integrin β3TGFβ signaling axis as a potential therapeutic target for HER2-induced TICs.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

According to the cancer stem cell hypothesis, a variety of tumors may be initiated and
maintained by a subpopulation of cells that exhibit characteristics of stem cells. In addition
to driving carcinogenesis, these stem-cell-like cancer cells (CSCs), also called tumor
initiating cells (TICs), may contribute to therapeutic resistance (Clarke et al., 2006). Several
recent studies have shown that human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) may play
a role in regulation of the TIC population. First, TICs of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer
cell lines express the highest HER2 levels in the bulk cell population (Magnifico et al.,
2009). Second, overexpression of HER2 in normal mammary epithelial cells increases the
proportion of stem/progenitor cells (Korkaya et al., 2008). Thirdly, the HER2 inhibitor
(trasuzumab or lapitinib) is able to specifically target this HER2-overexpressing TIC
population (Korkaya et al., 2008; Magnifico et al., 2009). Lastly, a decrease in TICs was
observed in HER2-positive tumors of patients receiving the EGFR/HER2 inhibitor treatment
(Li et al., 2008). These lines of evidence suggest that the HER2 signaling drives
carcinogenesis through regulation of the mammary stem/progenitor cell population.

Author Manuscript

The role of Her2/neu in regulating TIC properties was also studied in the MMTV-Her2/neu
transgenic mouse model. Liu et al. first functionally identified the existence of TICs in
primary mammary tumors of MMTV-Her2/neu-transgenic mice (Liu et al., 2007) and
Cicalese et al. showed that the self-renewal division of TICs is more frequent in Her2/neuinduced tumors than normal stem cells in their normal counterparts (Cicalese et al., 2009).
Furthermore, the gene profiles of MMTV-Her2/neu mammary tumors are most congruent
with the gene signature of luminal progenitor cells, suggesting that Her2-induced mammary
tumors may be developed from altered mammary luminal progenitor cells (Lim et al., 2010).
Despite supportive evidence from these studies, currently there are no available methods
developed for isolation or enrichment of TICs from Her2/neu-induced mammary tumors.
Therefore, even though MMTV-Her2/neu-transgenic mice have been used as a Her2mediated tumorigenic animal model for about two decades (Guy et al., 1992), the identity of
TICs in Her2/neu-induced mammary tumors remains largely unknown.
To identify and characterize the putative TICs in the MMTV-Her2/neu transgenic mouse
model, we screened numerous putative stem/progenitor marker combinations to subdivide

the primary mammary tumor cells and their derivative primary cell cultures. By analyzing
these markers, we identified luminal progenitors potentially giving rise to Her2-induced
TICs. Importantly, we found that the CD49fhighCD61high tumor cell subset represents a TICenriched population and the cooperative integrin β3-TGFβ signaling axis is vital for
maintaining Her2-induced TICs. These findings, taken together, suggest that targeting of the
cooperative integrin β3-TGFβ signaling could be developed for the TIC-targeting therapy to
treat HER2/Neu-positive breast cancer patients.

Results
Identification of TIC biomarkers for Her2/neu-induced mammary tumors

To identify potential stem-cell biomarkers and characterize molecular traits of stemness in
Her2-induced mammary tumors, we performed gene expression profiling analysis of twentysix putative stem cell markers and five epithelial lineage-specific markers (Supplementary
Table 1 and 2) on H6O5 cells derived from Her2-induced mouse primary mammary gland
tumors and NMuMG cells, a nontransformed mouse mammary epithelial cell line (Hynes et
al., 1985) serving as a normal control for comparison. Before gene expression analysis,
Her2/neu overexpression in H6O5 cells has been confirmed by Western blot analysis and its
levels were almost equivalent to those in primary Her2 tumors (Supplementary Figure 1). 9
out of 26 analyzed genes were expressed at higher levels in H6O5 than in NMuMG,
including Abcg2, CD49f, CD61, ESA, Nanog, Notch3, Oct3/4, Stat3 and Tp63
(Supplementary Table 2 and Figure 1a). Among lineage-specific markers, H6O5 cells
expressed slightly less mRNA levels of CD24 and the luminal marker Keratin 18 (Krt18)
and higher levels of myoepithelial markers such as Keratin 5 (Krt5) and Keratin 14 (Krt14)
than NMuMG cells (Supplementary Table 2). To further validate that 9 aberrantly
overexpressed genes identified in H6O5 cells were not attributable to forced in vitro culture
condition, we performed qRT-PCR analysis on two samples each of isolated in vivo normal
epithelial cells from FVB/N mammary glands and tumor epithelial cells from primary
Her2/neu mammary gland tumors. As shown in Figure 1b, 8 out of 9 genes (except Stat3)
consistently showed aberrant overexpression in primary Her2/neu mammary tumor
epithelial cells compared to age-matched normal FVB/N mammary epithelial cells.

Author Manuscript

Among these differentially expressed genes, CD49f (integrin α6), CD61 (integrin β3) and
ESA have been identified and used as bona fide markers for the enrichment of normal and
cancer stem cells (Stingl et al., 2006; Asselin-Labat et al., 2007; Vaillant et al., 2008; Lim et
al., 2010). To validate qRT-PCR results and evaluate whether these selected markers can be
potentially used to identify and enrich TICs, FACS analysis was performed on H6O5 cells
and two normal mammary epithelial cell lines (NMuMG and C127) to examine the
expression status of selected markers, including CD49f, CD29, CD61, Sca1, CD24 and ESA
(EpCAM). CD49f, CD61 and ESA were selected due to their aberrant overexpression in
H6O5 cells and primary tumors (Figure 1a and 1b). CD29 and Sca1 were also chosen since
they have been used as markers to identify normal and neoplastic mammary stem and/or
progenitor cells (Welm et al., 2003; Shackleton et al., 2006; Stingl et al., 2006; AsselinLabat et al., 2007). CD24 was included in our study based on the studies by Liu et al.,
showing that only CD24+ Her2/neu tumor cells are tumorigenic (Liu et al., 2007). As shown

in Figure 1c, CD49f, CD61 and ESA were expressed at higher levels in H6O5 cells than in
the control cell lines, consistent with the mRNA expression data (Figure 1a). CD29 and
CD24 were almost equivalently expressed between these three cell lines (Figure 1c). Sca1
was highly expressed in C127 cells compared to H6O5 and NMuMG cells (Figure 1c).
Overall, these data suggest that CD49f, CD61 and ESA are potential candidates as TIC
markers due to their differential expression in Her2/neu-transformed tumor cells compared
to non-transformed mammary epithelial cells.

MMTV-Her2/neu transgenic mice develop undifferentiated adenocarcinomas after a long
latency (6-12 months) (Guy et al., 1992). To identify the origin of Her2-transformed TICs,
we examined changes in cellular subsets of preneoplastic mammary glands. The previous
study showed that CD24 and CD49f can identify mammary stem cells (mammary
repopulating units, MRUs) and progenitor cells (mammary colony-forming cells, Ma-CFCs)
(Stingl et al., 2006). We reproduced these data as shown in Figure 2a (the top panel).
Intriguingly, the progenitor cell population (Lin−CD24highCD49fmed/low cells) was
aberrantly expanded in preneoplastic mammary glands of MMTV-Her2/neu transgenic mice
compared to normal counterparts of wild-type FVB/N mice (9.8% vs. 3.1%), which
overlapped the majority (79.2%) of the primary tumor cell population (Figure 2a). The
percentage of the mammary stem cell population (Lin−CD24medCD49fhigh, MRUs)
remained unchanged in preneoplastic mammary glands of transgenic mice relative to wildtype mice (0.8% vs. 0.7%). We also analyzed the FACS profiles of CD49f and ESA due to
the recent findings that these two markers could delineate cellular subsets in human
mammary glands (Lim et al., 2009). Analogous to the CD24CD49f combination, ESA and
CD49f could define the MRU and Ma-CFC populations (Figure 2a, the middle panel).
Again, the Lin−ESAhighCD49med/low Ma-CFC population, but not the
Lin−ESAmedCD49fhigh MRU population, was anomalously expanded in premalignant
mammary glands of Her2/neu-transgenic mice (Figure 2a). The FACS patterns showing
expansion of the Ma-CFC population in Her2/neu preneoplastic mammary glands (Figure
2a) were reproducible in multiple mice (n > 4) (data not shown). Among Lin−CD24+
mammary epithelial cells, the percentage of Lin−CD49f+ cells progressively increased with
tumor development (wild type 24.3%, preneoplastic gland 36.8% and tumor 81.8%) (Figure
2a, the bottom panel). According to the studies by Stingl et al., Ma-CFCs preferentially
express luminal markers such as Keratin 18 and Keratin 19, indicating that they are luminal
progenitor cells (Stingl et al., 2006). We also found that Ma-CFCs exhibited the ESAhigh
profile, a typical luminal feature (Lim et al., 2009). Therefore, our and other lines of
evidence, taken together, suggest that the origin of Her2/neu-induced mammary tumor cells
is derived from the aberrant luminal progenitor cells.
We also analyzed the cellular subset expressing CD61 in combination with CD24 or CD49f
during tumor development in MMTV-Her2/neu transgenic mice. Preneoplastic mammary
glands exhibited a slight increase in both Lin−CD24+CD61+ (1.7% vs. 1.1%) and
Lin−CD49f+CD61+ cells (1.6% vs. 1.2%) compared to wild-type counterparts, but both
Lin−CD24+CD61+ (89.2%) and Lin−CD49f+CD61+ (89.9%) cell populations were
drastically expanded in primary tumors (Figure 2b and 2c). The expansion of

Lin−CD24+CD61+ and Lin−CD49f+CD61+ cells in primary tumors was mainly due to a
dramatic increase in the Lin−CD61+ cell population, and more importantly there was a
significant, tumor-specific increase in the expression level of CD61 at the cellular level.
Thus, the transition from preneoplasia to tumor formation is characterized by a significant
increase in CD24/ESA/CD49f/CD61-quadruple positive cells (Figure 2).

According to the Figure 2 results, we identified CD49f, CD61, ESA and CD24 as potential
TIC’s makers since they can be used to track the transformed transition from luminal
progenitor cells to Her2-induced tumor cells. To ascertain which two-antigen combination is
potential for identifying the TIC population, we performed FACS analysis of five different
antigen combinations on in vitro cultured H6O5 cells, in vivo H6O5-derived xenograft
tumors and primary Her2 mammary tumors. As shown in Figure 3a, the FACS profiles of
H6O5-derived xenograft tumors were almost identical to those of primary Her2 tumors,
demonstrating that the primary H6O5 line is a suitable cell model for studying Her2-induced
primary mammary gland tumors. Among the FACS profiles of in vitro cultured H6O5 cells,
only CD49f/CD61, ESA/CD61 and ESA/CD49f were akin to those in xenograft and primary
tumors (Figure 3a). The differences in CD24/CD61 and CD24/CD49f profiles between in
vitro cultured tumor cells and in vivo tumors might be attributable to in vitro culture
condition. For identifying both in vitro and in vivo TICs, CD49f, CD61 and ESA are suitable
markers for further studies. However, due to very strong fluorescent staining of ESA in
H6O5 cells, we preferred the CD49f/CD61 combination for the FACS gating in cell sorting
analysis. To develop a promising FACS gating strategy, we used the CD49f/CD61 profile of
NMuMG to set the quadrant threshold lines for defining three different subpopulations in
H6O5 cells (Figure 3b). These three subsets, CD49fhighCD61high, CD49fhighCD61low and
CD49flowCD61low, are 12-15%, 35-40% and 25-30%, respectively, of total cells. To
investigate the relationship between these three gated populations and ESA/CD24 profiles,
we performed four-color FACS analysis on H605 cells using antibodies against these four
markers. As shown in Figure 3b, 89.9% of CD49f highCD61high subset cells overlapped
CD24highESAhigh compared to only 25.4% of CD49f lowCD61low subset cells. A strong
correlation between these four potential stem/progenitor cell markers suggests that tumor
cell types in Her2/neu-induced mammary tumors are heterogeneous and may be organized
like a hierarchy proposed in the cancer stem cell model. This phenomenon has also been
confirmed using isolated in vivo tumor cells (data not shown).

To address whether CD49f and CD61 are useful markers for enriching TICs, we examined
tumorsphere formation abilities of these sorted fractions. The CD49f highCD61high
subpopulation exhibited the highest tumorsphere formation efficiency (2.8 ± 0.6%)
compared to CD49f highCD61low and CD49f lowCD61low populations displaying much
lower efficiencies (0.8 ± 0.3% and 0.3 ± 0.1%, respectively) (Figure 4a). The observed
significant increase in tumorsphere formation ability indicates that TICs are enriched in the
CD49fhighCD61high subpopulation.

Given that tumorigenicity is one of the hallmarks of TICs, we assessed the tumorigenic
potential of the sorted cells with in vitro clonogenic and in vivo transplantation assays. As
shown in Figure 4b, CD49fhighCD61high cells exhibited the highest clonogenic ability
compared to other two subset cells. For in vivo transplantation assays, we transplanted
serially diluted sorted subset cells from H6O5 or primary tumors, ranging from 5000 to 20,
into syngeneic mice. For primary tumors, Lin−CD49f highCD61high subset cells showed the
highest TIC frequency (1/70) compared to other two subset cells showing much lower TIC
frequencies (1/239 for Lin−CD49f highCD61low and 1/1234 for Lin−CD49f lowCD61low)
(Table 1). The sorted cells from H6O5 manifested a similar trend of TIC frequencies (Table
1). Therefore, TICs in MMTV-Her2/neu mammary tumors or in H6O5 cells were
significantly enriched in the CD49f highCD61high population. In addition to the highest
frequency of TICs, the CD49f highCD61high subpopulation conferred an earliest onset of
tumor formation compared to other two populations (Figure 4c). To address whether the
CD49f highCD61high subpopulation possesses the drug-resistant characteristic of cancer stem
cells, clonogenic assays were performed on sorted CD49f highCD61high and
CD49f lowCD61low H6O5 cells treated with pacitaxel or doxorubicin. Indeed,
CD49f highCD61high cells were more resistant to these chemotherapeutic agents than
CD49f lowCD61low cells (Figure 4d).

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are endowed with the ability to self-renew indefinitely and
differentiate into phenotypically diverse cells. To reveal whether the CD49f highCD61high
subpopulation exhibits these CSC features, we analyzed cellular subtypes in xenograft
tumors derived from these three sorted cell fractions. The tumors derived from the
CD49f highCD61high subpopulation were composed of cell populations similar to the
original primary tumors, demonstrating that the CD49f highCD61high subpopulation is able
to self-renew its own population (12.2± 0.7%) and also convert into other cell populations
during tumor formation (Figure 5). In contrast, the tumors derived from CD49f highCD61low
and CD49flowCD61low fractions contained significantly lower percentages of the
CD49f highCD61high subpopulation (7.9 ± 0.6% and 1.6 ± 0.6%, respectively) (Figure 5),
indicating that these two sorted cell fractions contain less CSCs than the
CD49f highCD61high fraction. These results show that CD49f highCD61high cells exhibit CSC
traits of self-renewal and regeneration of heterogeneity of primary tumors.
The TGFβ signaling and expression of EMT genes are specifically activated in the
CD49fhighCD61high subpopulation

Author Manuscript

To further characterize TICs in Her2/neu tumors, gene expression profiling analysis was
performed to examine expression of putative stem cell and differentiation marker genes. The
cancer stem cell markers Abcg2 (Ishikawa and Nakagawa, 2009), Aldh1 (Ginestier et al.,
2007), CD133 (Wright et al., 2008), Gli1 (Liu et al., 2006) and Tp63 (Hanker et al., 2010)
were highly expressed in the CD49f highCD61high subpopulation compared to other two
sorted subpopulations (Figure 6a). In contrast, the expression levels of differentiation marker
genes such as Krt5, Krt6, Krt14 and Krt18 were lowest in CD49f highCD61high cells (Figure
6b). These data further confirm that the CD49f highCD61high subpopulation is enriched for
TICs with stem cell characteristics.

The TGFβ signaling has been known to play a critical role in regulating the pluripotency of
human embryonic stem cells and cancer stem cells via induction of an Epithelial–
Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) (James et al., 2005; Mani et al., 2008). To examine the
status of TGFβ signaling in sorted cells, we analyzed the expression of several selected
TGFβ downstream responsive genes (Pai, Il6, Igfbp3 and Foxc2). Compared to
CD49flowCD61low cells, expression of Pai (Yang et al., 2007), Il6 (Park et al., 2003), Igfbp3
(Kveiborg et al., 2001) and Foxc2 (Mani et al., 2007) were upregulated in
CD49f highCD61high cells by 4.8, 3.8, 2.5 and 3.6 folds, respectively (Figure 6c). Moreover,
increased phosphorylation and total levels of TGFβ-downstream mediators Smad2/3 were
observed in CD49f highCD61high cells compared to CD49flowCD61low cells (Figure 6d).
Therefore, both gene expression and protein analysis data indicate that the TGFβ signaling
was further activated in the TIC-enriched subpopulation. This suggests that the TGFβ
signaling may play a critical role in Her2-mediated tumorigenesis and maintenance of the
TIC population.
To investigate whether expression of the EMT genes in CD49f highCD61high cells is
upregulated concurrently with the TGFβ-target genes, we examined the expression status of
5 canonical EMT genes including Cdh2, Sma, Snail, Twist1 and Zeb1(Kalluri and Weinberg,
2009). All of these genes were expressed in CD49f highCD61high cells at the highest levels
compared to other two subpopulations (Figure 6c). In addition, Foxc2 analyzed as a TGFβtarget gene is also involved in EMT (Mani et al., 2007). These data show that
CD49f highCD61high cells express the highest TGFβ signaling and EMT gene signatures
compared to non-TIC-enriched subsets.

Treatment with TGFβ pathway inhibitors suppresses EMT gene expression and
concurrently leads to a reduction in the TIC population
To examine the functional relevance of the TGFβ signaling in maintenance of the
CD49fhighCD61high population, we treated H6O5 cells with two different TGFβ receptorspecific inhibitors, SB431542 and A-83-01. As shown in Figure 7a, these two inhibitors
dramatically decreased the CD49f highCD61high subpopulation by over 70%. This effect was
not due to inhibition of overall cell growth (Supplementary Figure 2). Nevertheless, the
TGFβ signaling pathway was significantly inhibited as shown by drastically reduced levels
of phosphorylated Smad2/3 (Supplementary Figure 3). These data suggest that blockade of
the TGFβ signaling pathway may preferentially inhibit the self-renewal of TICs.

Author Manuscript

TGFβ activity is known to induce an EMT, which can potentially generate cells with stemcell properties (Mani et al., 2008). We then addressed whether abrogation of the TGFβ
signaling pathway can lead to suppression of EMT marker gene expression. As shown in
Figure 7b (the bottom panel), expression levels of 5 out of 6 EMT genes (except Twist1) in
drug-treated cells dramatically decreased compared to those in vehicle-treated cells. These
changes in the EMT gene expression profiles correlated with reverse EMT-like
morphological changes in drug-treated cells (Figure 7b, the top panel). These data suggest
that the TGFβ receptor inhibitors may preferentially inhibit the expansion of the TIC
population by suppressing expression of genes involved in EMT.

To further validate whether the TIC population is reduced by abrogation of the TGFβ
signaling, we examined clonogenic and tumorsphere-forming abilities of drug-treated cells.
Consistent with FACS results (Figure 7a), 46.1%- and 60.5%-suppressive extents of
tumorsphere formation were observed in SB431542-treated and A-83-01-treated cells,
respectively, relative to vehicle-treated cells (Figure 7c). Besides a decrease in tumorsphere
number, a significant reduction in sizes of tumorspheres from drug-treated cells was
observed (data not shown). Similarly, treatment with SB431542 and A-83-01 resulted in a
dramatic reduction in colony formation by 76.8% and 81.9%, respectively (Figure 7d).
These findings, taken together, indicate that the TGFβ signaling plays an essential role in
maintenance of the Her2-transformed TIC population.
Suppression of the integrin β3 pathway impairs TGFβ signaling and self-renewal of TICs

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The molecular mechanisms underlying elevated activation of TGFβ signaling in the TICenriched subpopulation are particularly interesting but unknown in our study. It has been
shown that integrins are involved in activation of TGFβ signaling (Margadant and
Sonnenberg, 2010). Given that the TIC-enriched subpopulation manifests the
CD49f highCD61high trait, it raises the possibility that these two integrin molecules may be
implicated in activation of TGFβ signaling. Several lines of evidence have shown that αvβ3
integrin molecules are able to activate the TGFβ ligand in vitro and integrin β3 interacts
physically with the TGFβ receptor (TGF-βRII) to modulate the TGFβ signaling (Scaffidi et
al., 2004; Galliher and Schiemann, 2006, 2007; Wipff et al., 2007). To unravel whether
integrin β3 (CD61) is engaged in activating TGFβ signaling in H6O5 cells, we performed
small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown experiments on H6O5 cells. As shown in Figure
8a, siRNA-mediated knockdown of CD61 gave rise to decreased phosphorylation of FAK at
Tyr397 and c-Src at Tyr416 (the downstream mediators of integrin β3 signaling), indicating
the downstream signaling of integrin β3 was inhibited by CD61 knockdown. Concurrent
with reduced integrin β3 signaling, the TGFβ signaling was attenuated by CD61 knockdown,
indicated by decreased phosphorylation of Smad2/3 (Figure 8a). This result demonstrated
that CD61 is required for activation of TGFβ signaling. We have shown that the TGFβ
signaling is essential for maintenance of Her2-induced TICs (Figure 7). This suggests that
CD61 may be crucial for maintaining the TIC population. To test it, CD61 siRNAtransfected H6O5 cells were subjected to sphere formation assays compared to untransfected
and control siRNA-transfected cells. A decrease of about 30% in sphere formation
efficiency was observed in H6O5 cells with CD61 knockdown when compared to control
cells (Figure 8b). These data, taken together, indicate and the cooperative integrin β3-TGFβ
signaling axis is mandatory for self-renewal ability of TICs.

Discussion
The growing consensus of the CSC model is attributable to the successful use of surface
biomarkers for detecting and enriching CSCs in both human cancers and animal models
(Clarke et al., 2006). However, the fact that no universal markers are able to identify TICs
from all types of tumors may partially result from heterogeneous origins of cancer initiating
cells (Visvader, 2011). Although existence of TICs has been functionally identified in
MMTV-Her2/neu tumors (Liu et al., 2007), no specific markers have been found to enrich

them. In our study, combined analysis of CD24, CD49f and ESA revealed that MMTVHer2/neu-induced mammary tumors are potentially derived from the aberrant mammary
luminal progenitor cell population, which is based on these following lines of evidence: (1)
The CD24highCD49fmed/low Ma-CFC progenitor population was anomalously expanded in
preneoplastic MMTV-Her2/neu mammary glands relative to age-matched, normal
counterparts (Figure 2a). (2) The detected, expanded cell population also displayed ESAhigh
(Figure 2a), a feature similar to human mammary luminal progenitor cells (Lim et al., 2009).
(3) Gene expression profiles of MMTV-Her2/neu tumor cells are most concordant with the
luminal progenitor gene signature (Lim et al., 2010). Therefore, we for the first time
deciphered the potential cell population candidate for the origin of MMTV-Her2/neu
mammary tumors. More importantly, we developed a method employing the combination of
CD49f and CD61 to identify and enrich TICs in MMTV-Her2/neu mammary tumors as well
as in Her2-tumor-derived primary cell cultures.

Our data convincingly demonstrate that MMTV-Her2/neu tumors are heterogeneous and
CD49fhighCD61high subset cells are enriched for TICs based on both in vitro clonogenic and
in vivo transplantation assays. It has been proposed by Vaillant et al. that MMTV-Her2/neu
tumors are composed of a more homogeneous cell population according to FACS analysis
(Vaillant et al., 2008). If tumors are composed of homogenous cells, we would expect that
there is no correlated cellular distribution between markers such as ESA, CD24, CD49f and
CD61. In contrast to this expectation, the CD49fhighCD61high subset also showed highest
expression levels of both CD24 and ESA than other subsets, indicating co-expression of
these markers in a TIC-enriched subset of tumor cells. This notion is further supported by
the fact that the stemness, TGFβ pathway and EMT gene signatures are specifically, highly
expressed in the TIC-enriched subset. Taken together, our results suggest that the CSC
model may be still applied to the Her2/neu-induced mouse tumor model.

Through enrichment of TICs in the CD49fhighCD61high subpopulation, we found that the
TIC-enriched subpopulation expresses the highest levels of the TGFβ-responsive gene
signature and exhibits increased TGFβ signaling compared to the other subpopulations of
tumor cells. This suggests that cells with different phenotypes, even within the same tumor
and tissue type, may differentially respond to TGFβ receptor inhibitors. Indeed, our results
demonstrate that treatment with TGFβ receptor inhibitors had no effect on overall cell
survival and growth but led to a specific reduction in the TIC population. Analogous to our
findings, Shipitsin et al. found that the TGFβ signaling pathway is specifically activated in
CD44+ TICs and treatment with the TGFβ receptor inhibitors had no significant effect on the
proliferation and survival of tumor cells but resulted in dramatic morphological changes in
CD44+ cells, similar to mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) (Shipitsin et al., 2007).
Taken together, our and other studies further emphasize the importance of the TGFβ
signaling for maintaining the pool of TICs in both mouse and human mammary tumors.
By knockdown of CD61, we have demonstrated that the integrin β3 signaling pathway is
imperative for sustaining the TGFβ signaling and the cooperative integrin β3-TGFβ
signaling axis plays an indispensable role in maintaining Her2-transformed TICs. These
findings for the first time provide novel evidence to link the integrin β3-TGFβ signaling
mode to TICs and to decipher, at least in part, the mechanisms underlying increased

activation of TGFβ signaling in TICs. The αvβ3 integrin-Src signaling axis has been shown
to facilitate TGFβ-mediated induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in
mammary epithelial cells and promote breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion (Galliher
and Schiemann, 2006, 2007). The oncogenic roles of the αvβ3 integrin-Src signaling axis in
TGFβ signaling and EMT may account for our observations that the TIC-enriched
CD49fhighCD61high subset exhibited increased TGFβ signaling and the typical EMT gene
signature. According to accumulating evidence to show the importance of targeting of TICs
in cancer therapy, our novel findings linking the integrin β3-TGFβ signaling axis to Her2transformed TICs may have immediate therapeutic implications due to the current testing of
TGFβ pathway inhibitors and αvβ3 integrin antagonists in clinical trials (Biswas et al., 2006;
Desgrosellier and Cheresh, 2010).

Cell isolation and culture
Isolation of cancer epithelial cells from mammary tumors of MMTV-Her2/neu-transgenic
mice and establishment of the primary Her2-overexpressing tumor cell line H6O5 were
described previously (Chen et al., 2010). The procedures for isolating Lin− epithelial cells
from mammary glands are described in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Flow cytometry analysis and sorting

Author Manuscript

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was performed using an FC500 CXP
flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA). Cells were stained with the
following antibodies: FITC and PE-conjugated anti-CD49f (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD,
USA), Alexa 488-conjugated anti-CD61 (BioLegend), PE and APC-conjugated anti-CD24
(BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), PE and APC-Cy7-conjugated anti-ESA (BioLegend).
Cell sorting was carried out on a FACSAria II cell sorter (Becton Dickinson).
In vitro clonogenic assays
Sorted or drug-treated H6O5 cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 1000 cells/well
or in 6-cm culture dishes at a density of 5000 cells/dish in complete medium. After 2 weeks,
colonies were fixed and then stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Colonies with sizes ≥ 1 mm
were counted.
In vitro tumorsphere formation assays

Author Manuscript

Sorted or drug-treated viable H6O5 cells were plated in ultra-low attachment 6-well plates
(Corning, Acton, MA, USA) at a density of 10,000 cells/ml in serum-free DMEM/F12
medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF, Sigma, St.
Louis, MO, USA), 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, Sigma), 5μg/ml insulin
(Sigma), 1×B27 supplement (Invitrogen) and 0.4% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma).
Cells were cultured under 5% CO2 at 37°C for a week (Gu et al., 2011).

In vivo tumorigenesis assays

Author Manuscript

Sorted cells were resuspended in 20 μl DMEM/F12 medium and mixed with 20 μl Matrigel
(Becton Dickinson) at a 1:1 ratio and held on ice. The entire 40μl sample was injected into
either no. 3 or 4 mammary glands of MMTV-Her2/neu-transgenic mice anesthetized with
isoflurane according to the animal protocol approved by the USC committee for research in
vertebrate animals. Tumor sizes were measured weekly. Incidence of xenograft tumor
formation was scored 12-13 weeks after injection.
