addressed the predictive value of circulating levels of the extracellular domain
(ECD) of HER2 in patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with
letrozole.

METHODS. Two hundred twenty-six patients with hormone receptor-positive,
metastatic breast cancer received letrozole (2.5 mg daily) until they developed either disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Efficacy was measured primarily as the time to progression (TTP) and, secondarily, as the objective response
rate (ORR) and overall survival. HER2 ECD levels were determined by using a
sandwich enzyme HER2/neu immunoassay before letrozole treatment was
initiated. Positive HER2 ECD status was correlated with treatment efficacy.

RESULTS. Forty-two patients (19%) had elevated HER2 ECD levels, which were
associated with primary tumor HER2 expression (P < .001) but not with age, per-

mas and that this overexpression is associated with a
poor prognosis.2,3 Like with other cell-surface transmembrane receptors, the ECD of HER2 is shed into
the circulation and can be detected in the serum
from some patients with breast cancer.4–6 Monitoring
circulating HER2 ECD levels is a promising tool for
predicting response to therapy, for assessing prognosis, and for early detection of disease progression.7 In
our hands, 2 prospective studies using paclitaxelcontaining chemotherapy have demonstrated that
elevated levels of HER2 ECD in patients with metastatic breast cancer are correlated with reduced efficacy of chemotherapy.8,9 There also is evidence for a
role for HER2 ECD in predicting resistance to hormone treatment. Elevated HER-2 ECD predicted a
decreased response to hormone therapy in patients
with metastatic breast cancer,10 and the results from
retrospective hormone treatment studies demonstrated a similar trend with HER2 ECD.11,12
Letrozole is a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor
and is used in the treatment of hormone-dependent,
advanced breast cancer. In a clinical trial that did
not include patients with bone metastases, the
results indicated that letrozole was superior to tamoxifen for the first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive,
metastatic breast cancer.13 A study that was performed in a subgroup of patients from that trial who
had serum samples available demonstrated that e
patients with normal serum levels of HER2 ECD who
received letrozole had a significantly better overall
tumor response, more clinical benefit, and a longer
time to progression (TTP) than patients who received
tamoxifen.14
Our prospective cohort study was designed specifically to compare the efficacy of the aromatase inhibitor letrozole in postmenopausal patients with
metastatic breast cancer when they were divided
according to serum level of HER2 ECD. In addition,
this study was conducted in a patient population
that was not selected on the basis of metastatic
organ involvement.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Patients who were included in this open, prospective,
multicenter cohort study were required to have metastatic breast cancer that had progressed or recurred
after treatment with antiestrogens. Eligible patients
had to meet the following inclusion criteria: 1) ambulatory, postmenopausal patients with advanced
breast cancer who had been treated previously with
antiestrogens (tamoxifen) and who had proven

2179

objective tumor progression; 2) an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
from 0 to 2; 3) estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and/
or progesterone receptor (PgR)-positive disease; 4)
age > 18 years; 5) life expectancy > 3 months; 6)
written informed consent; and 7) serum sample
available. The exclusion criteria were: 1) life-threatening or rapidly progressing metastases of the central
nervous system, pulmonary lymphangitis, inflammatory breast cancer, or evidence of liver metastases
involving >30% of the organ and detected by ultrasound and/or computed tomography scan; 2) additional other concurrent or previous malignancies
other than contralateral breast carcinoma, or conebiopsied in situ carcinoma of the cervix, or adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of
the skin; 3) patients with lymphedema, ascites, central nervous system metastases, or medullar suppression as the unique manifestation of disease; 4)
concomitant antineoplastic treatments; 5) concomitant endocrine therapy (except topical, inhaled, or
intra-articular corticosteroids); 6) known hypersensitivity to letrozole or to any other component of the
drug; 7) any patient who was receiving any investigational medication had to have a wash-out period of 7
days for topically applied drugs and 30 days for systemic-administered drugs; 8) any patient who was
participating in a different clinical trial within the
previous 4 weeks; 9) legal and/or other circumstances that indicated the patient was not able to
understand the design of the study and/or the consequences of participation; and 10) unknown or negative ER and PgR status. The protocol was reviewed
and approved by the Institutional Review Board. Preliminary results from the current study have been
reported previously.15

Treatment Plan and Criteria for Response
Pretreatment evaluation included assessing clinical
variables like patient characteristics, menopausal status, disease history and diagnosis, hormone receptor
status, prior antitumor treatments, ECOG performance status, and tumor assessment. Serum samples
were collected prospectively in all patients. Before
initiating treatment, a 10-mL venous blood sample
was drawn, centrifuged at 3 3000g for 5 minutes at
room temperature, aliquoted in 2 parts of 3.6 mL,
and stored in polypropylene cryotubes at 2208C.
When available, tissue samples of the primary breast
carcinomas mounted in paraffin blocks were sectioned for immunohistochemical analyses.
The treatment administered was oral letrozole at
a dose of 2.5 mg once daily until disease progression
or unacceptable toxicity occurred. A complete tumor

assessment was performed at baseline, and areas
that were identified as positive for metastatic target
lesions were monitored every 3 months for response.
Patient assessment continued until there was evidence of disease progression, which we defined
according to World Health Organization criteria. All
patients were monitored for survival at 6 months after conclusion of the study-drug treatment. No local
treatments were allowed in the target lesions. A complete response (CR) was defined as the complete disappearance of all disease for 4 weeks, and a partial
response (PR) was defined as a reduction 50% in
tumor volume.
The TTP, duration of response, and overall survival were calculated from the date of entry into the
study. TTP was calculated from the date of entry into
the study up to the date of either disease progression
or death. Duration of response in patients who
achieved an objective response was calculated from
the date of entry into the study up to the first detection of disease progression in patients who achieved
a CR or PR. Overall survival was calculated as the
time from entry into the study until the date of
death. Those patients who remained alive and in
whom it was not known whether the disease had
progressed were censored at the date they were last
known to be alive.

HER2 Measurements
All laboratory analyses were performed centrally to
preclude variation in analyses and interpretation.
The samples were analyzed without knowledge of
their provenance. Serum testing was performed at
the Hospital 12 de Octubre, and immunohistochemical testing was completed at the Institut Catala
d’Oncologia.
The levels of circulating HER2 ECD in serum
samples were measured by using a sandwich enzyme
immunoassay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (human neu quantitative Immuno-1
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]; Bayer
Diagnostics; Cambridge, Mass).16 The HER2 ECD
values were expressed in ng/mL. The laboratory’s
upper limit of the reference range was set at 20 ng/mL.
Immunohistochemical analysis for HER2 in primary tumor tissue was performed by using the antiHER2 antibody CB11 (Biogenex, San Ramon, Calif ) at
a dilution of 1:80. The results also were tested by
using a streptavidin-biotin detection system (LSAB2
kit; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). Color development
was completed with diaminobenzidine using Harris
hematoxylin counterstain. Membrane HER2 staining
was quantified in percentages (0–100%). Tumors

were considered positive when 10% of tumor cells
had intense membrane staining (score, HER2 31).

Statistical Methods
Discrete variables were described by using absolute
and relative frequencies. Continuous variables were
described as mean values, median values, standard
deviations, and ranges. The association of HER2 ECD
with clinical parameters was evaluated with the chisquare test. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used
to compare time-to-event variables, such us TTP, duration of response, and survival, for the groups of
patients. The log-rank test was used to compare survival curves. Multivariate analysis was performed
using a Cox regression model. All statistical analyses
were performed using SPSS software (version 11.5 for
Windows; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).

RESULTS
Patients and Clinical Variables
There were 226 evaluable patients. Nonevaluable
patients included 24 patients without confirmation
of ER-positive and/or PgR-positive status, 3 patients
who received concomitant antineoplastic medication,
2 patients who were lost to follow-up, 1 patient was
a man, 1 patient was not postmenopausal, and 1
patient did not have a serum sample available. The
median age was 64 years (range, 39–90 years). All 32
women who were aged < 50 years had follicle-stimulating hormone and lutenizing hormone levels in the
postmenopausal range and had been amenorrheic
for at least 12 months. The median performance status was 0 (range, 0–2). Hormone receptor status was
ER-positive/PgR-positive in 62% of patients, ER-positive/PgR-negative in 32% of patients, and ER-negative/PgR-positive in 7% of patients. Sites of
metastasis were bone in 46% of patients, soft tissues
in 32% of patients, lung in 17% of patients, and other
sites in 39% of patients. The median number of metastasis was 2 (range, 1–6 metastases), and the median follow-up was 24 months (95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 3–37 months).
Overall, 42 patients (19%) had elevated levels of
HER2 ECD. Circulating HER2 ECD levels ranged
from 4 ng/mL to 477 ng/mL (mean, 20 fmol/mL;
standard deviation, 35 ng/mL), and the median levels
were 14 ng/mL.
Correlations were sought between circulating
HER2 ECD levels and several clinical variables, and
the results are summarized in Table 1. Age, ECOG
performance status, metastases sites or numbers did
not correlate with positive HER-2 ECD status.

portion of positivity, indicating a low tumor burden.
Positivity for CA15-3, which is a marker of metastatic
burden, had a significant association with elevated
HER2 ECD levels (Table 1). We evaluated the degree
of association between CA15-3 and HER2 ECD using
a Spearman correlation test on the absolute marker
values and observed a significant association
(P 5 .002), although the value was moderate (correlation coefficient [r] 5 0.23). A higher proportion of
HER2 ECD positivity was observed in the patients
who had ER-negative/PgR-positive receptor status
(14%), although the total number of patients in this
category with positive hormone receptor status was
small.
The median TTP was 12 months (95% CI, 9–15
months). There were 29 patients who achieved a CR
and 33 patients who achieved a PR, for an overall
response rate of 27% (n 5 62 patients). The median
overall survival had not been reached and the 2-year
overall survival rate was 69% at the time of this
writing.

measured in 112 primary breast carcinomas using
paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Overall, 30 samples (27%) were HER2-positive according to immunohistochemical analysis. A significant association
between HER2 expression in tumor tissue and HER2
ECD level was observed (P 5 .001). Table 1 shows
that 43% of patients who had HER2-positive primary
tumors had elevated levels of HER2 ECD compared
with 12% of patients who had HER2-negative primary tumors.

Correlation Between Circulating HER2 ECD and
Treatment Efficacy
The median TTP differed significantly between
patients with elevated and nonelevated levels of circulating HER-2 ECD (4 months vs 14 months,
respectively; P 5 .0004). Figure 1 depicts the inverse
relation between elevated levels of circulating HER-2
ECD and the TTP.
The objective response rate (CR 1 PR) was 14%
in patients who had elevated levels of serum HER-2
ECD compared with 30% in patients who had normal
levels of serum HER-2 ECD (P < .036) (Table 2).
Patients who had elevated levels of serum HER-2
ECD had a median overall survival of 22 months
(95% CI, 18–27 months). The median overall survival
was not reached by patients who had normal levels
of serum HER-2. There was a statistically significant
relation between the levels of circulating HER2 ECD
and survival (P < .0005) (Fig. 2). The 2-year overall
survival rate was 44% in patients who had elevated
levels of serum HER-2 ECD compared with 75% in
patients who had normal levels.

The importance of positive HER2 ECD status
was evaluated further by using a multivariate analysis
that included clinically relevant variables along with
HER2 ECD. Table 3 shows that positive HER2 ECD
status retained its significant association with a poor
TTP in the Cox proportional hazards regression
model (P 5 .001).

DISCUSSION
In the current prospective study, we tested HER2
ECD levels in baseline serum samples from 226
patients with hormone receptor-positive, advanced
breast cancer who were treated with the aromatase
inhibitor letrozole. The results indicated that patients
who had elevated circulating levels of HER2 ECD had
significantly poorer outcome than patients who had
nonelevated levels of HER2 ECD. The TTP (4 months
vs 14 months) and the response rate (14% vs 30%)
were significantly worse in HER2 ECD-positive
patients. In addition, the 2-year overall survival rate

also was decreased significantly in HER2 ECD-positive patients (44% vs 75%). The independent role of
circulating HER2 ECD was confirmed in multivariate
analysis, which ruled out, for example, a dependent
role of HER2 ECD on metastatic tumor burden measured as the number of metastatic sites with the nonspecific marker CA15-3.
HER2 expression has been implicated in the development of resistance to hormone therapeutic
agents in patients with breast cancer.12,17 Previous
reports had suggested that circulating HER2 ECD
concentrations are associated with reduced efficacy
of aromatase inhibitors, selective ER modulators, and
megestrol acetate.10,11,13 In a neoadjuvant study of
endocrine therapy in stage II and III breast carcinomas, Ellis et al.18 reported that HER2 amplification
prevented letrozole from suppressing the expression
of Ki67, which is a marker of cancer cell proliferation, although it did not affect clinical response. Our
current prospective study confirmed that the expression of circulating HER2 ECD correlates inversely
with the efficacy of hormone therapy.10–13 In the
past, we8,9 and others19 reported a relation between
HER2 ECD levels and the diminished efficacy of a
different therapeutic modality: chemotherapy. In the
current study, we designed a prospective prognostic
evaluation that was aimed specifically at assessing
the relation of HER2 ECD with the efficacy of hormone treatment. Unlike our study, other trials that
assessed the relation between hormone treatment
and HER2 ECD10–13 performed analyses on patient
subsets that were selected from overall clinical trial
populations. The proportion of patients who participated in those trials who had serum samples available ranged from 25%11 to 62%.13 In our study,
sample availability was one of the inclusion criteria;
therefore, all evaluable patients had HER2 ECD concentrations determined. In addition, the patient
population in our study reflected quite accurately the

HER2 ECD and Lack of Response to AI/Colomer et al.

patients in a cancer clinic. In our series, for example,
the proportion of patients with bone metastases was
twice that of the proportion in registration trial of
letrozole conducted by Mouridsen et al.13
A secondary endpoint of our study focused on
HER2 ECD levels in relation to HER2 immunohistochemistry evaluations conducted in tissue samples.
In previous studies of patients with metastatic or
early breast cancer, we and others demonstrated a
significant correlation between HER2 ECD and positive HER2 immunohistochemistry.8,21–24 Primary tumor sampling was optional within the study
protocol; and, from the 112 paraffin blocks that we
obtained, we were able to confirm that there was a
significant association between circulating concentrations of HER2 ECD and the expression of HER2 in
the primary tumor (P < .001). Although 12% of
patients who had primary tumor tissues that were
negative for HER2 but that converted to positive in
the serum testing, 43% of patients with HER2-positive tissues also had positive serum samples. This
reflects differences in the assay reagents, the timing
of the test procedures, and the limits of sensitivity of
circulating markers. The monoclonal antibodies and
the techniques that were used for the measurement
of HER2 in sera and in tumors were not the same
(ELISA vs immunohistochemistry, respectively). A limitation of our study derives from the finding that
we did not perform fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) in the tissue samples. According to our previous experience, this may have resulted in an under
estimation of HER2 tumor positivity by 15%.25 In a
series of 283 unselected patients with primary breast
carcinoma in which we evaluated an algorithm of
double immunohistochemistry (with antibodies CB11
and Herceptest) plus FISH, FISH testing changed the
HER2 status from negative to positive in 10 patients
of the total 64 who had positive HER2 status. In a
selected population of patients with ER-positive carcinoma, which is associated with negative HER2 status, this proportion should be smaller. Nevertheless,
the elevated degree of concordance that was
observed in the current study was fully comparable
to that reported by others.21
A limitation of studies that involve HER2 ECD in
patients with advanced cancer is that, although tumor HER2 levels were determined at the time of
breast surgery, HER2 ECD levels were determined
much later in the course of the disease when distant
metastases were present, which may have provided
enough time to develop positive HER2 status. Along
this line, a study of multiple biopsies in patients with
advanced breast cancer who were receiving hormone
treatment indicated that HER2 amplification ap-

2183

peared from 9 months to 31 months after the initiation of therapy in 6 of 34 HER-2/neu-negative
patients.20 Furthermore, patients with low metastatic
tumor burden, like that possibly expressed in
patients with soft tissue involvement, as in our study,
had low amounts of HER2 protein in serum. Once
the recurrence occurs, however, measuring the circulating HER2 ECD concentrations may be the only
practical way of assessing HER2 status, because a biopsy of distant metastasis often is not feasible.7 An
advantage for the use of serum samples over archival
tissues in patients with advanced breast carcinoma is
that, in general, serum samples may be obtained easily at the time of disease recurrence. Thus, the measurement of circulating HER2 in serum may be
simple and also may reflect the actual HER2 status
more accurately than the measurement of HER2 in
archival paraffin blocks.8
By using an HER2 ECD cutoff of 20 ng/mL, 19%
of patients were positive. Twenty nanograms per
milliliter was the mean value in our series of
patients. Other authors have used a cutoff of 20 ng/
mL in a series of preoperative patients.24 In previous
studies in patients with more advanced metastatic
disease, we optimized the cutoff at 30 ng/mL,8
whereas other authors have suggested a lower
threshold of 15 ng/mL.14,19 To exclude cutoff-related
biases, in our series, we analyzed cutoffs of 15 ng/
mL and 30 ng/mL. With these cutoffs, the percentages of patients who were positive were 39% and
7.5%. We observed a similar, significant relation of
positive HER2 ECD status and reduced TTP (P 5 .022
for 15 ng/mL; P < .022 for 30 ng/mL). A decrease in
HER-2/neu ECD levels after some months or even
weeks of therapy has been associated with response
to therapy19,26,27 Our study did not contemplate repetitive serum sampling; therefore, we were not able
to perform a dynamic evaluation of HER2 ECD.
A noteworthy finding in our study was that the
proportion of HER2 ECD positivity was correlated
with the ER/PgR phenotype. HER2 ECD positivity
was 12% in ER-positive/PgR-positive patients, 26% in
ER-positive/PgR-negative patients, and 40% in ERnegative/PgR-positive patients. We performed an
analysis of TTP in relation to the ER/PgR phenotype
and observed that the TTP was significantly better in
ER-positive/PgR-positive patients than in ER-positive/PgR-negative patients (17.6 months vs 11.8
months; P 5 .014). These results may help to explain
the improved differential effect of anastrozole compared with tamoxifen in the retrospective subset
analysis of the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in
Combination (ATAC) adjuvant trial28 Supporting this
finding, in a multivariate analysis of our series, the

ER/PgR phenotype lost its statistical significance in
favor of HER2 ECD status.
It has been suggested that the 3 key issues for
tumor marker evaluation in breast cancer are utility,
magnitude, and reliability.29 In the instance of HER2
ECD reported here, the use clearly is focused on the
predictive value for efficacy of therapy, the magnitude of the effect is large (the TTP is reduced by a
factor of 3 when HER2 ECD is positive), and the
reliability of the ELISA test is excellent.16 In terms of
levels of evidence (LOE),28 our study should be contemplated as LOE I/LOE II, because it provides evidence from a single prospective study that was
designed specifically to test the utility of the marker.
The literature indicates that patients who have
HER2-positive breast cancer have a poorer outcome
when they are treated with any form of chemotherapy or hormone therapy.8,9,12–14,19 Our study, therefore, like other previously reported studies, may be
detecting only an ‘‘HER2-driven behavior,’’ which, as
we have demonstrated, is independent of metastatic
tumor burden. The importance of this issue in the
future, however, may be diminished by the generalization of trastuzumab therapy in patients with
HER2-positive disease and by the demonstration that
HER2 ECD is a useful marker for monitoring patients
who receive trastuzumab-based therapy.21
In conclusion, the results of the current prospective study confirmed that patients with metastatic
breast cancer who exhibit elevated levels of HER2
ECD have an unfavorable clinical course when they
are treated with letrozole. The implications for overcoming HER2-associated resistance to aromatase
inhibitors by combining these agents with anti-HER2
antibodies in HER2-positive patients increasingly are
becoming apparent, and results from the Phase III
Trastuzumab in Dual HER2-ER-positive Metastatic
Breast Cancer (TAnDEM) study (anastrozole alone
compared with anastrozole plus trastuzumab in ERpositive/HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer) has
confirmed this approach.30
