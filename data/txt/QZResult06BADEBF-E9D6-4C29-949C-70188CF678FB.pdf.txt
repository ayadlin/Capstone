ABSTRACT:
Cancer cells with stem or progenitor properties play a pivotal role in the initiation,
recurrence and metastatic potential of solid tumors, including those of the human
prostate. Cancer stem cells are generally more resistant to conventional therapies
thus requiring the characterization of key pathways involved in the formation and/
or maintenance of this malignant cellular subpopulation.
To this end, we identified Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3β (GSK-3β) as a crucial
kinase for the maintenance of prostate cancer stem/progenitor-like cells and
pharmacologic inhibition of GSK-3β dramatically decreased the size of this cellular
subpopulation. This was paralleled by impaired clonogenicity, decreased migratory
potential and dramatic morphological changes. In line with our in vitro observations,
treatment with a GSK-3β inhibitor leads to a complete loss of tumorigenicity and a
decrease in metastatic potential in preclinical in vivo models. These observed antitumor effects appear to be largely Wnt-independent as simultaneous Wnt inhibition
does not reverse the observed antitumor effects of GSK-3β blockage. We found that
GSK-3β activity is linked to cytoskeletal protein F-actin and inhibition of GSK-3β leads
to disturbance of F-actin polymerization. This may underlie the dramatic effects of
GSK-3β inhibition on prostate cancer migration. Furthermore, GSK-3β inhibition led
to strongly decreased expression of several integrin types including the cancer stem
cell-associated α2β1 integrin. Taken together, our mechanistic observations highlight
the importance of GSK-3β activity in prostate cancer stemness and may facilitate the
development of novel therapy for advanced prostate cancer

INTRODUCTION

a major challenge remains to improve survival of these
patients. A principal limitation of docetaxel, the current
first-line therapy for metastatic CRPC, is initial or acquired
resistance which largely reduces its anti-tumor efficacy.
Hence, the identification of specific pathways involved in
therapy resistance is pivotal for the development of novel
treatment options for advanced prostate cancer.
An increasing number of studies demonstrate that
a small subpopulation of transformed cells with stemand progenitor properties, also referred to as cancer stem
cells (CSCs), is involved in prostate cancer initiation,
metastasis and the resistance to current therapies [6].
While ALDHHIGH, CD44+ and α2-integrinHIGH CSCs in
primary prostate cancer predominantly display a basal

Prostate cancer is the most common diagnosed male
malignancy with over 900 000 new cases and over 250
000 deaths worldwide in 2008 [1]. At early stage, when
the disease is still organ-confined, treatment options
include prostatectomy or radiation. Unfortunately, 2025% of patients will experience relapse within 5 years
of treatment [2]. Once prostate cancer has spread beyond
the prostate it is incurable and, at this stage, androgen
deprivation therapy is the standard treatment. However,
virtually all patients relapse with castration-resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC) within 1-3 years [3-5]. Despite

cell phenotype, the stem/progenitor cells that survive
androgen-deprivation therapy and re-initiate tumor
growth exhibit a luminal progenitor phenotype [7-10].
The notion that CSCs play an essential role in resistance
to conventional therapies warrants the characterization
of key pathways and proteins for the formation and
maintenance of tumor- and metastasis-initiating cells.
Selective targeting of such pathways is, therefore, urgently
required.
Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) is known
to play a role in several cellular processes such as cell
cycle control, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis
[11]. GSK-3β can phosphorylate a range of substrates
including glycogen synthase, cyclin D1/E and c-MYC
but is typically known for its role in the Wnt signaling
pathway in which it acts as a negative regulator of Wnt
effector molecule β-catenin [12]. Here, GSK-3β-mediated
phosphorylation of β-catenin leads to ubiquitination
and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the latter.
In several cancer types, uncontrolled Wnt signaling was
shown to be involved in the development of several solid
tumors [13, 14].
In this study, the importance of GSK-3β activity
for the maintenance of prostate cancer stem/progenitorlike subpopulation and its involvement in metastasis was
evaluated. We show that GSK-3β provides a potential
therapeutic target that is functionally involved in prostate
cancer stem cell maintenance, tumorigenicity and
metastasis in vivo.

reporter construct, BAT-Firefly luciferase [19, 20], and
CAGGSpromotor-Renilla luciferase as a control for
transfection efficiency. As expected, GSK-3β inhibition
led to a strong, 5-fold, induction of Firefly luciferase/
Renilla luciferase ratio, indicating enhanced Wnt
signaling (Fig. 1, left). This dose-dependent induction of
Wnt signaling upon GSK-3β inhibition was reversed by
simultaneous incubation with the downstream inhibitor of
Wnt signaling, PNU-74654, in which the 100 µM dose led
to a near complete reversal of the induced Wnt signaling
in PC-3 cells (-72%, Fig. 1, left). In PC-3M-Pro4 cells,
a 400-fold induction of Wnt signaling was observed
upon GSK-3β inhibition which was partially reversed by
addition of 30 µM PNU-74654 (-52%, Fig. 1, right).

GSK-3β Inhibition and Stem/Progenitor-like Cells
Based on these initial experiments, the dosage of
100 nM GIN was selected for the following functional
experiments. We evaluated the effect of GSK-3β inhibition
on the prostate cancer stem/progenitor-like subpopulation,
and subsequently on functional cellular characteristics
such as the clonogenic and migratory capacity. GSK-3β
inhibition almost completely eradicated the subpopulation
of ALDEFLUOR+ or ALDHHIGH stem/progenitor-like cells
in PC-3 and PC-3M-Pro4 cells [10], while C4-2B4 and
DU-145 cells were not significantly affected (Fig. 2a). In
line with this, the mRNA expression of 5 out of 7 tested
ALDH isoforms was significantly downregulated in PC3M-Pro4 cells upon GSK-3β inhibition (Suppl. Fig. 2a).
In addition, expression of genes known to be critically

RESULTS
GSK-3β Inhibition Affects Cellular Morphology
The cellular morphology upon treatment with
selective GSK-3β inhibitor GIN [17, 18] revealed a change
from a stellate mesenchyme-like shape to a more round
shaped morphology in PC-3M-Pro4 cells (Suppl. Fig. 1a,
Day 1 & 3). This morphological effect was completely
reversible, as removal of GIN resulted in restored cell
growth and normalized cellular morphology (Suppl. Fig.
1a, Day 6 & 8, lower row). Continued GSK-3β inhibition
led to a long-lasting effect on cellular morphology (Suppl.
Fig 1a, Day 6 & 8, center row).

GSK-3β is mostly known for its inhibitory role in
the Wnt signaling pathway, in which it phosphorylates
β-catenin which targets the latter for proteasomal
degradation and thereby prevents Wnt signaling [14].

a decrease in colony number, the colonies that were
observed upon GSK-3β inhibition were much smaller then
under vehicle-treated conditions (not shown). The strong

suggest cell-type independency of GSK-3β inhibition.
Also, inhibition of GSK-3β activity resulted in a strong
decrease in cellular migration of all tested prostate cancer
cell lines; PC-3 (92% inhibition), PC-3M-Pro4luc2
(-88%), C4-2B4 (-87%) and DU-145 (-71%) (Fig. 2c).
Interestingly, while C4-2B4 cells lost their clonogenic
and migratory potential upon GSK-3β inhibition, the
ALDHHIGH population remained unaffected. This shows
that the functional effects of GSK-3β inhibition are not
necessarily accompanied by a change in the activity
of ALDH enzymes. To exclude that any of the effects
described above could be attributed to increased cell
death upon GSK-3β inhibition, the percentage of trypan
blue-positive cells were counted (Suppl. Fig. 1b) which
revealed no significant increase in cell death.
To evaluate if the stimulation of Wnt signaling was
causally involved in the observed effects, canonical Wnt
signaling was blocked using PNU-74654. This did not
reverse the diminishing effects on the stem/progenitorlike population, the anti-clonogenic and the anti-migratory

its effects independent of Wnt signaling. Notably, 100
µM PNU-74654 significantly reduced migratory potential
under basal and GSK-3β inhibitory conditions, suggesting
that active Wnt signaling may, in fact, be positively
correlated with migration of prostate cancer cells.

Based on the strong effects of GSK-3β inhibition
on the stem/progenitor cell subpopulation in vitro, we
evaluated the effects of GIN pretreatment on prostate
cancer tumorigenicity and metastatic potential in vivo.
To this end, PC-3M-Pro4luc2 cells were pretreated
with vehicle or GIN in vitro for 48 hours prior to
subcutaneously inoculation in Balb-c nu/nu mice (Fig.
3a). GIN pretreatment resulted in a complete loss of
tumorigenic potential, resulting in a significant decrease
of subcutaneous tumor burden as soon as 14 days after
tumor inoculation (Fig. 3b, 3c).
Next, we assessed the potential anti-metastatic
effects of GSK-3β inhibition in a xenograft model of
experimentally-induced bone metastasis. PC-3M-Pro4luc2
cells were, again, pretreated with vehicle or GIN for
48 hours and inoculated into the left cardiac ventricle
of Balb-c nu/nu mice (Fig. 4a). As expected, vehiclepretreated prostate cancer cells readily formed bone
metastases at multiple sites throughout the body (Fig. 4b,
4c) [10]. Strikingly, pretreatment with GIN led to a nearcomplete loss of metastatic tumor burden in this model
(Fig. 4c).

Polymerization and Reduces Integrin Expression
The results described above highlight a strong
attenuating effect of GSK-3β inhibition on cancer
stemness and migration in vitro and tumorigenic and
metastatic potential in vivo. Based on our observation
that the cellular morphology of prostate cancer cells was
disturbed following GSK-3β inhibition and a previous
study pointing out a link between GSK-3β and F-actin
[23], we performed a DAPI/Phalloidin double staining to
monitor F-actin polymerization. This clearly revealed a
strong reduction of F-actin polymerization upon GSK-3β
inhibition (Fig. 5a). In accordance with our data on the
stem/progenitor subpopulation, clonogenic ability and
migration, co-incubation with Wnt inhibitor PNU-74654
did not restore F-actin polymerization in PC-3 or PC-3MPro4 prostate cancer cells (Fig. 5a). Previously, a causal
link between F-actin and several integrin isoforms has
been described [21, 24, 25]. Based on this, we examined
the expression of αv- (ITGAV), α2- (ITGA2) and α6integrin (ITGA6) in GIN-treated PC-3M-Pro4 cells and

enhanced orthotopic and metastatic growth in vivo [10].
We now show that blockage of GSK-3β activity leads to
a massive reduction in the size of this highly tumorigenic
cellular subpopulation of ALDHHIGH prostate cancer
cells with a concomitant reduction in clonogenic and
migratory potential of human prostate cancer cell lines.
Similar findings of GSK-3β inhibition were described for
glioblastoma, in which a reduction of stem cell markers
was described upon GSK-3β inhibition subsequently
leading to impaired neurosphere formation and lessened
clonogenicity [26, 27].
The striking anti-tumor effects of GSK-3β inhibition
in vitro were paralleled by a significant decrease in
subcutaneous growth and bone metastasis in vivo of
the osteotropic prostate cancer cell line PC-3M-Pro4.
Previous findings with other GSK-3β inhibitors (e.g.
LiCl, TDZD8) in subcutaneously xenografted cancer cells
further support this notion [28, 29]. In addition, other
studies show anti-tumor effects of GSK-3β inhibition
on prostate cancer cells in vitro, but these effects were
predominantly attributed to modulating effects on the
androgen-receptor axis [30, 31], or changes in cell cycle
proteins [23]. Although the androgen receptor may be
partially responsible for decreased growth upon the
suppression of GSK-3β activity in the tested androgenreceptor positive cell lines, it cannot explain the robust
effects in the androgen-receptor negative cell lines PC-3
and PC-3M-Pro4. Moreover, we found that GSK-3β
inhibition mainly acts on cancer stem/progenitor-like cells
which were shown to be largely androgen-independent
[9, 32]. It appears, therefore, that the drastic anti-tumor
effects of GSK-3β inhibition cannot be solely explained
by modulation of the androgen-receptor axis.
GSK-3β is typically known for its role in the Wnt
signaling pathway, in which it phosphorylates β-catenin
in the absence of Wnt signaling. As expected, inhibition
of GSK-3β resulted in increased Wnt signaling in the
tested prostate cancer cell lines. To date, the exact role
of Wnt signaling in prostate cancer progression has
remained controversial. The observations that various Wnt
antagonists like members of the Dickkopf (Dkk) family
are highly expressed in osteotropic prostate cancer cells
[33], upregulated in prostate cancer patients [34] and that
stable expression of Dkk-1 stimulates prostate cancer
growth [35] all suggest that decreased Wnt signaling may
also be beneficial for metastatic outgrowth.
Our data indicate that increased Wnt signaling is
not mechanistically involved in the observed anti-tumor
effects mediated by pharmacologic GSK-3β inhibition.
Blocking Wnt signaling by downstream inhibition of
the β-catenin/TCF interaction after GSK-3β inhibition
does not restore the stem/progenitor-like subpopulation
and their clonogenic and migratory potential. Hence,
it appears that GSK-3β activity is involved in prostate
cancer stemness and migration via a Wnt-independent
mechanism. However, other studies have shown that

DISCUSSION
The importance of stem/progenitor cells in prostate
carcinogenesis, cancer repopulation, therapy response
and metastatic potential is increasingly being recognized
[7-10]. Accumulating evidence suggests that CSCs are
highly resistant to conventional therapies for the treatment
of (advanced) prostate cancer, which warrants further
characterization of pathways and target genes essential
for these tumorigenic and metastasis-initiating cells.
Identification and selective targeting of such key pathways
or proteins may provide a highly promising approach to
deplete this highly malignant subpopulation of cells in
prostate carcinoma. In this study, we established the
role of GSK-3β in the acquisition and maintenance of an
invasive, tumorigenic and metastatic phenotype in human
prostate cancer cells using a selective, small molecule
inhibitor of GSK-3β.
Previously, we showed that ALDHHIGH stem/
progenitor subpopulation of human prostate cancer display
increased clonogenic and migratory potential in vitro and

Wnt signaling is involved in prostate cancer growth
as was shown by increased sphere formation upon
exogenous addition of Wnt3a [36] and anti-tumor effects
upon Wnt inhibition [37-39] (reviewed in [40]). Also,
(embryonic or hematopoietic) stem cells appear to be
largely dependent on Wnt signaling [41, 42], pointing out
a positive correlation of Wnt signaling and stemness. It
seems, therefore, that the observed anti-tumor effects of
GSK-3β attenuation overrule the previously described
pro-tumor effects of Wnt hyperactivation. Strikingly, in
mixed-lineage leukemia, activation of Wnt signaling was
sufficient to (partially) revert anti-tumor effects of GSK3β inhibition, and combined blockage of GSK-3β and
β-catenin was required to achieve tumor regression [43].
Next, we hypothesized that the effect of GSK-3β
inhibition may be mediated via its effect on cytoskeletal
rearrangements, in particular the actin cytoskeleton.
The regulation of the actin cytoskeleton [23] and focal
adhesions [44] were previously linked with GSK-3β
activity. In non-transformed cells, i.e. hematopoietic
stem and progenitor cells, GSK-3β can influence F-actin
polymerization through Rac, Arf6 and Rho activation
which results in lamellipodia formation and this is an
essential process in cellular migration. Here, inhibition of
GSK-3β resulted in reduced motility through interference
with actin polymerization [45]. In our studies, we observed
a strong reduction of F-actin polymerization upon GSK3β inhibition, which appears to be the predominant
mechanism involved in the suppression of cellular
migration in vitro and tumorigenicity and metastasis in
vivo. Furthermore, we found that GSK-3β inhibition led to
a reduction of integrin αv, α-2 and α6 expression, possibly
mediated via the association of these integrins with F-actin
[24, 25]. As integrin signaling was previously shown to
be involved in cancer stem/progenitor cell maintenance
[21, 46, 47] and bone metastasis [22, 48-50], we strongly
believe that the disturbance of F-actin via GSK-3β
inhibition, thereby leading to reduced integrin-mediated
adhesion and signaling, is responsible for the decrease in
prostate cancer stemness and bone metastasis.
Taken together, our mechanistic observations
highlight the importance of GSK-3β activity in the
maintenance of prostate cancer stem/progenitor-like
cells and prostate cancer progression in vivo. Current
findings with pharmacologic GSK-3β inhibitors may, thus,
facilitate the development of novel therapy for incurable,
advanced prostate cancer.
