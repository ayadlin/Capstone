ABSTRACT
Background: KRAS mutation is common in human cancer. We assessed the clinical
factors, including type of KRAS mutation and treatment, of patients with advanced
cancer and tumor KRAS mutations and their association with treatment outcomes.
Methods: Patients referred to the Phase I Clinic for treatment who underwent
testing for KRAS mutations were analyzed.
Results: Of 1,781 patients, 365 (21%) had a KRAS mutation. The G12D mutation
was the most common mutation (29%). PIK3CA mutations were found in 24% and
10% of patients with and without KRAS mutations (p<0.0001). Of 223 patients
with a KRAS mutation who were evaluable for response, 56 were treated with a
MEK inhibitor-containing therapy and 167 with other therapies. The clinical benefit
(partial response and stable disease lasting ≥ 6 months) rates were 23% and 9%,
respectively, for the MEK inhibitor versus other therapies (p=0.005). The median
progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.3 and 2.2 months, respectively (p=0.09). The
respective median overall survival was 8.4 and 7.0 months (p=0.38). Of 66 patients
with a KRAS mutation and additional alterations, higher rates of clinical benefit
(p=0.04), PFS (p=0.045), and overall survival (p=0.02) were noted in patients treated
with MEK inhibitor-containing therapy (n=9) compared to those treated with targeted
therapy matched to the additional alterations (n=24) or other therapy (n=33).
Conclusions: MEK inhibitors in patients with KRAS-mutated advanced cancer were
associated with higher clinical benefit rates compared to other therapies. Therapeutic
strategies that include MEK inhibitors or novel agents combined with other targeted
therapies or chemotherapy need further investigation.

(GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs)[2-4].
KRAS is a key intracellular protein that activates multiple
pathways, including the MAPK and PI3K pathways[5].
Mutant KRAS proteins are GAP-insensitive;
therefore, the protein is constitutively GTP-bound,
which leads to persistent and independent activation of
the downstream effectors[4]. In addition, certain tumor
types are associated with specific KRAS mutations,
which differ in their carcinogenic potential[6-10]. The
high frequency (up to 30%) of RAS mutation in human
cancers[11] has stimulated the development of targeted
agents against KRAS. Farnesyltransferase inhibitors, which
were the first agents used to block the binding of RAS
isoforms to the cancer cell membrane, had disappointing
results[12-14]. In recent years, the focus has shifted to
inhibiting the downstream signaling pathways of RAS.
Clinical trials with MEK inhibitors as single agents
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and/or in combination with cytotoxic agents have been
completed[15-19].
Mutations in the KRAS gene, which occur
commonly in codons 12, 13, and 61, encode for a single
amino-acid substitution. Emerging data demonstrate that
each amino-acid substitution may affect the activity of
KRAS differently, leading to a different affinity for the
various downstream molecules[6]. For example, the G12D
mutation encodes for a protein with high affinity for PI3K,
while the G12C and G12V mutations activate RAS-like
GTPase.
The clinical outcomes of patients with advanced
cancer and KRAS mutations by type of codon and aminoacid substitution have not been systematically explored.
Therefore, we retrospectively reviewed data from patients
with advanced cancer and KRAS mutations who were
treated in the Phase I Clinical Trials Program at The

American 29%, Asian 22%, White 20%; p=0.03). The
occurrence of KRAS mutations varied by tumor type, as
summarized in Table 1 and Figure 1a. The most commonly
analyzed tumor types were colorectal, lung, and ovarian
cancer, reflecting the pattern of referrals to the Phase I
Clinic (Figure 1b). Molecular analyses were performed on
tumor samples from the primary site in 198 (54%) patients
and from a metastatic site in 167 (46%) patients.
Patients with KRAS mutations were more likely to
have more than two metastatic sites than patients with
wild-type KRAS (36% vs. 27%, respectively; p=0.0008).
No difference in the number of prior therapies was noted
between patients with wild-type and mutated KRAS
(p=0.53).

there was no difference in age (median, 59; p=0.62) or sex

mutation was the most common mutation overall (29%) in
all tumor types except for lung cancer, in which G12C and
G12V were more frequent. No G12C or codon 13 (G13D,
G13C, G13R, and G13V) mutations were noted in the 28
patients with pancreatic cancer.
Among the 365 patients with KRAS mutations,
256 (70%) were found to have tumors harboring KRAS
mutations without any other molecular alterations.
Alternatively, 109 (30%) patients were found to have
tumors with ≥1 additional molecular alterations. The
distribution of the various additional molecular alterations
in both mutated and wild-type KRAS is summarized in
Table 3. The number of additional molecular alterations
was higher in mutated KRAS than in wild-type KRAS. The
most frequently tested alterations were PI3KCA, BRAF,
and EGFR; the most common alterations found in both
wild-type and mutant KRAS tumors were PI3KCA, p53,
and PTEN. A higher percentage of patients with mutated
KRAS had PIK3CA mutations compared to patients with
wild-type KRAS (24% vs. 10%, respectively; p<0.0001).
In contrast, more patients with wild-type KRAS had BRAF
mutations compared with patients with mutated KRAS (7%
vs. 0.4% respectively; p=0.0002).

prognostic covariates (lactate dehydrogenase level,
serum albumin level, number of metastatic sites, and
ECOG performance status) for patients with advanced
cancer treated on phase I clinical trials were confirmed
in this analysis. Furthermore, the presence of additional
mutations was found to be a good prognostic feature (HR:
0.7; p=0.03). Interestingly, after adjustment for other
variables, G12V was found to be associated with longer
survival compared to G12A (p=0.008; Supplemental Table
1).

Outcomes of patients with KRAS mutations by
therapy
The median number of phase I trials that patients
with a KRAS mutation were treated on was one (range,
1-5). Clinical outcomes, including clinical benefit (partial
response and stable disease ≥ 6 months per RECIST), PFS,
and OS, are summarized in Table 4. Of 365 patients with
KRAS mutations, 223 were evaluable for response. The
other patients were excluded for the following reasons:
loco-regional therapy (n=54), decline in performance
status (n=28), consent withdrawal (n= 14), loss of followup (n=11), early toxicity (n=8), or other (n=27).
Of 157 patients with a KRAS mutation and no
additional known alterations, 47 received a MEK
inhibitor--containing therapy and 110 received nonMEK inhibitor therapy including another targeted agent,
chemotherapy, or both. In subset analyses by tumor type,
no significant difference was noted in outcomes between
patients treated with a MEK inhibitor--containing therapy
and those treated with other therapies. However, a
trend towards a higher rate of clinical benefit was noted
in patients with pancreatic cancer treated with MEK
inhibitor--containing therapy compared to other therapies
(p=0.07). When the total number of patients with a KRAS

with the specific mutation (for instance, patients with the
G12A mutation appeared to have poorer outcomes than
those with other mutations), but the differences were not
statistically significant (p=0.07) (Figure 2a).
Univariate and multivariate analyses of the
prognostic significance of baseline characteristics
of patients with KRAS mutations are summarized in

mutation was analyzed regardless of tumor type, the rate
of clinical benefit of patients treated with a MEK inhibitor-containing therapy was higher than that of those treated
with other therapies (p=0.02).
Of 66 patients with KRAS mutations and other
molecular alterations, nine received a MEK inhibitor-containing therapy, 24 received therapies matched
with other alterations (all targeted against alterations in
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway), and 33 received nonmatched therapies. The overall clinical benefit rates were
22%, 0%, and 15%, respectively (p=0.04). In addition,
patients who received a MEK inhibitor--containing
therapy had longer PFS (p=0.09) and longer overall
survival (p=0.02) compared to the other treatment groups
(Figure 2b and 2c).
When all 223 patients with a KRAS mutation with
or without an additional alteration were included in
the analysis, MEK inhibitor-containing therapy had a
statistically significantly higher rate of clinical benefit
compared to other therapies (23% vs. 9%, respectively;
p=0.005). A trend towards longer PFS was also noted in
the MEK inhibitor group compared to others (p=0.09). No
difference in overall survival was noted (p=0.38).

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic
analysis of the clinical outcomes of patients with KRAS
mutations treated on phase I clinical trials. We found that
KRAS mutations vary by tumor type. This heterogeneity
in amino acid substitution is thought to be associated with
differences in the clinical course of the disease. The use of
MEK inhibitors in patients with KRAS-mutated advanced
cancer was associated with higher clinical benefit rates
compared to other therapies.
In our series, the proportion of tested patients with
pancreatic cancer with KRAS mutation was similar to
that reported in the COSMIC database[20]. However, the
proportions of tested patients with colon and lung cancers
with KRAS mutation were slightly higher than published

Our data also demonstrated that patients with KRAS
mutations had a higher proportion of PI3KCA alterations
than patients with wild-type KRAS (24% vs. 10%,
respectively; p<0.0001) and that patients with wild-type
KRAS had a higher proportion of BRAF mutations than
patients with KRAS mutations (7% vs. 0.4%, p=0.0002)
(Table 3). The coexistence of PI3K and KRAS mutations
and the mutual exclusion of KRAS and BRAF mutations
had been previously reported in a subset of patients
with colorectal cancer [25, 26]. Furthermore, KRAS and
EGFR mutations coexisted in 4 patients (2 patients with
pancreatic cancer, 1 with CRC and 1 with NSCLC).
Various reports showed that KRAS and EGFR mutations
are mutually exclusive in patients with lung cancer[27-30];
however, some cases were previously reported to harbor
both EGFR and KRAS mutations[31-33].
In both preclinical and clinical settings, the coexistence of both KRAS and PI3KCA alterations was
reported to be a negative predictor of response to PI3K
inhibitors[26, 34-37] and MEK inhibitors[38]. Both PI3K/
AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK are downstream
pathways of the KRAS protein[39, 40]. Our data showed
that treatment with a MEK inhibitor resulted in better
outcomes than treatment with PI3K pathway inhibitors.
Other investigators have demonstrated that tumors in
xenograft models with both PI3K and KRAS molecular
alterations regressed upon MEK inhibition and had a
less-pronounced response to PI3K inhibition[41], perhaps
suggesting that KRAS mutation may represent the driver
mutation. Whether the combination of MEK and PI3K
inhibitors is associated with better outcomes than either
inhibitor alone is currently being investigated in clinical
trials.
Our analysis has several limitations, which are
typical for retrospective analyses for patients with any
tumor type treated with targeted therapy based on genetic
alterations. These limitations include relatively small
numbers of patients with specific targetable alterations
per tumor type, not including alterations other than KRAS
mutations that can activate the MAPK pathway (as such
alterations were not tested routinely in CLIA-certified
laboratories), and various dose levels and various drugs
used in the analyses, resulting in large tested hypotheses
that cannot rule out false positive conclusions.
Prospective studies assessing the prognostic
significance of various KRAS mutations will help
elucidate the role of KRAS in human carcinogenesis. The
development of novel agents for treating patients with
KRAS mutations and therapeutic strategies that include
novel agents combined with other targeted therapies,
chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy is urgently needed.
In this direction, the National Cancer Institute is launching
a large-scale project to develop therapeutic strategies
against cancers driven by RAS with the contribution of
national scientific leaders and using core facilities and
modern technology.

data, perhaps in part reflecting the referral pattern in
our Phase I Program, which may be affected by the
availability of MEK inhibitor trials. This discrepancy can
also be explained by differences in the detection method,
histology subtypes, disease stage, and other factors.
Our analysis showed that KRAS mutation by specific
amino acid substitution varies by tumor type. The specific
KRAS mutations in colorectal cancer were similar to those
previously reported in a smaller series, in which G12D
and G12V were the two most commonly seen mutations
[21]. Furthermore, the various specific KRAS mutations
seen in lung cancer in our patient group were similar to
those previously reported [22].
One of the intriguing findings of our analysis
was the association of the KRAS G12V mutation with
longer survival compared with the KRAS G12A mutation
(p=0.008; Supplemental Table 1). This appears to be in
line with preclinical and clinical studies demonstrating
that specific KRAS mutations are associated with
heterogeneous outcomes [22-24].
In our analysis, the use of MEK inhibitors was
associated with an improved clinical benefit rate compared
with other therapies in patients with a KRAS mutation
(23% vs. 9%; p=0.005) (Table 4). This better disease
control with MEK inhibitor-containing trials translated
into a trend toward longer PFS in the MEK inhibitor
group compared with others (3.3 vs. 2.2 months; p=0.09).
However, no statistical difference in overall survival was
noted between the two groups (8.4 vs. 7 months, p=0.38),
perhaps because patients were treated with subsequent
therapies. In addition to the relatively small number
of patients, the short PFS seen in our analysis may be
explained by the poor-prognosis patient population, the
development of resistance to MEK inhibitors, or the
development of other driver alterations by the time the
patients started on treatment (archival tissue was used
for molecular profiling in most patients). Our results are
compatible with emerging data demonstrating that MEK
inhibitors have promising antitumor activity in patients
with KRAS-mutated cancer[18].
We also found that the presence of other molecular
alterations in addition to KRAS alterations was associated
with longer survival (Supplemental Table 1). The reason
is unknown, but the numbers of patients with a KRAS
mutation and 1 or ≥2 additional molecular alterations were
too small compared to patients with a sole KRAS mutation
(72, 37, and 256 patients, respectively) to draw meaningful
conclusions. Clinical studies should explore the clinical
significance of additional alterations in patients with tumor
KRAS mutations. For instance, additional alterations may
partially negate the effects of the KRAS mutation.
These results are hypothesis-generating, since they
were derived from a retrospective analysis and not from
a randomized trial. Therefore, one cannot distinguish
between the prognostic value and the predictive value of
certain types of KRAS mutations.

The types of treatment were categorized as (a)
MEK inhibitor--containing therapy or (b) other therapies
(targeted therapy with or without cytotoxic agents). If an
additional alteration to the KRAS mutation was present, the
treatment was categorized as follows: (a) MEK inhibitor-containing therapy, (b) targeted therapy for the additional
alteration, when applicable, or (c) other therapies.

mutations as part of molecular profiling. Patients referred
to the Phase I Clinic were of various ages, had advanced/
metastatic cancer that was refractory to standard therapy
or had relapsed after standard therapy, or had a tumor
for which there was no standard therapy available. All
protocols in the Phase I Clinical Trials Program required
that participants have evidence of evaluable or measurable
disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) guidelines[42, 43] and an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
of 0-2. Additional eligibility criteria varied according to
the protocol on which the patient was enrolled. All patients
provided written informed consent prior to enrollment onto
a trial. All trials, as well as this analysis, were performed
with the approval of and in accordance with the guidelines
of the MD Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review
Board.

Endpoints and statistical methods
Best response was assessed using imaging
studies performed every two cycles (1 cycle = 3-4
weeks, depending on the protocol) by an MD Anderson
radiologist. Tumor measurements were confirmed
independently by a physician in the response assessment
clinic within our department using RECIST guidelines
applicable at the time of the patient’s response assessment.
Clinical benefit (CB) from any therapy was defined as
complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable
disease (SD) for ≥ 6 months. Progression-free survival
(PFS) was measured from the first day of treatment on
a clinical trial until the patient came off study because
of disease progression or death, whichever came first.
Overall survival (OS) was measured from initiation of
treatment on a clinical trial until death from any cause or
last follow-up.
Patients’ characteristics at the time of presentation
in the Phase I Clinic were analyzed using descriptive
statistics. Categorical data were described using
contingency tables, including counts and percentages.
Continuously scaled measures were summarized
by median and range. The association between two
categorical variables was examined using the chi-squared
test. Survival and PFS were estimated using the KaplanMeier method, and survival was compared between groups
using the two-sided log-rank test. Survival and PFS were
analyzed based on the specific type of KRAS mutation and
the type of treatment. Statistical analyses were carried
out using TIBCO Spotfire S+ 8.2 for Windows (TIBCO
Software, Inc.).

Analysis of molecular alterations
Molecular profiling had been performed in a
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)certified Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, as previously
described[44] or at Foundation Medicine, Inc.

Therapy
Treatment was selected as previously described[44].
Briefly, patients whose tumors had a molecular aberration
were preferably treated on a clinical trial with a matched
targeted agent, when available. The allocation of patients
to investigational treatment varied according to protocol
availability, eligibility criteria, histologic diagnosis, the
patient’s prior response to therapy, potential toxicity,
insurance coverage, and patient preference or physician
choice. Patients treated with regional therapy were
excluded from the outcome analysis.
The patients with tumors harboring KRAS mutations
were treated with MEK inhibitor-containing therapy when
a clinical trial was available. Patients were treated in the
following clinical trials if the eligibility criteria were
met: NCT01138085, NCT00454090, NCT01378377,
NCT00687622, NCT01155453, and NCT01337765. If ≥ 2
molecular alterations were present, patients were treated in
