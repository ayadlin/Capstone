Abstract
Protein acetylation is a reversible process regulated by histone deacetylases (HDAC) that is often altered in
human cancers. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) is the first HDAC inhibitor to be approved for clinical use as an anticancer agent. Given that histone acetylation is a key determinant of chromatin structure, we
investigated how SAHA may affect DNA replication and integrity to gain deeper insights into the basis for its
anticancer activity. Nuclear replication factories were visualized with confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and single-replicon analyses were conducted by genome-wide molecular combing after pulse labeling
with two thymidine analogues. We found that pharmacologic concentrations of SAHA induce replicationmediated DNA damage with activation of histone γH2AX. Single DNA molecule analyses indicated slowdown
in replication speed along with activation of dormant replication origins in response to SAHA. Similar results
were obtained using siRNA-mediated depletion of HDAC3 expression, implicating this HDAC member as a
likely target in the SAHA response. Activation of dormant origins was confirmed by molecular analyses of
the β-globin locus control region. Our findings demonstrate that SAHA produces profound alterations in
DNA replication that cause DNA damage, establishing a critical link between robust chromatin acetylation
and DNA replication in human cancer cells. Cancer Res; 70(11); 4470–80. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Abnormalities in DNA replication are a major cause of genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer cells. It is therefore
important to understand the mechanisms regulating DNA
replication, chromatin structure, and cell cycle progression.
DNA replication must be coupled with the cell cycle to coordinate the activation of thousands of origins with the velocity
of replication forks to fully replicate the genome within each
cell cycle (1, 2). In metazoans, it is still not clear how origins
of replication are selected, and a large number of potential
origins remain quiescent. These dormant origins initiate replication when replication forks coming from neighboring
origins experience a slowing down or an arrest (3–6). Stalled

forks must be stabilized and processed to avoid inappropriate recombination and genomic instability (7, 8), and these
processes involve chromatin remodeling and histone modifications (9–11).
The accessibility of origins to the replication proteins is
likely to be influenced by chromatin structure and compaction. Acetylation on lysines facilitates an “open” chromatin
status by neutralizing the positive charges of lysines on histones (12). It also plays a regulatory role during DNA replication by facilitating both the removal of histones from the
DNA template and the reloading of histone on newly replicated DNA (9, 10, 13–18). In addition, deacetylation of newly
incorporated histones plays a major role in chromatin maturation (9, 18, 19).
Histone deacetylases (HDACs; also called lysine deacetylases) and histone acetyl transferases are enzymes that ensure the homeostatic levels of histone acetylation. They
also act reversibly on many other proteins in human cells.
A recent analysis revealed at least 3,600 acetylation sites in
1,750 different human proteins (20). Human cells have 18
zinc-dependent HDACs organized in four classes (21, 22).
Class I HDACs are nuclear and consist of HDAC1, HDAC2,
HDAC3, and HDAC8, which are orthologs of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rpd3. Yeast cells lacking Rpd3 display a
delay in S-phase progression, as measured by flow cytometry (23). Two-dimensional gel analysis showed that rpd3Δ
mutants have deregulated timing of origin firing, with late
origins being activated early (17, 23, 24). The other HDACs

HDAC Affects Replication Velocity and Dormant Origins

(class IIa, IIb, and IV) are primarily cytoplasmic and shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm. In contrast to the
aforementioned zinc-dependent HDACs, class III HDACs
(the sirtuins) are NAD dependent and are not targeted
by the HDAC inhibitors (HDACi). All HDACs are components of large multiprotein complexes (22).
HDACs are important drug targets for cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson and Alzheimer syndromes),
and there are >60 clinical trials currently under way. Given
their broad regulatory role, HDACs are complex targets for
cancer therapy. HDACi generally target more than one class
of zinc-dependent HDAC, and several pathways are likely to
be involved in their anticancer activity (22). Suberoylanilide
hydroxamic acid (SAHA; ref. 25) was the first HDACi approved by the Food and Drug Administration. SAHA is a
broad-spectrum HDACi targeting both class I and II HDACs.
It is marketed as Vorinostat (Zolinza) for the treatment of
cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (22). A number of clinical trials
are ongoing to explore additional uses for SAHA as an anticancer drug in combination therapies and to evaluate other
HDACi (22, 26). Although SAHA is known to induce histone
hyperacetylation as early as 4 hours after exposure (27), most
studies have focused on the ability of SAHA to induce cell
differentiation and apoptosis after long exposures, typically
24 hours or longer (28).
Because of the growing importance of SAHA and HDACi as
anticancer therapies (22, 26) and of our interest in DNA
replication (1), genomic integrity (29), and molecular pharmacology (30, 31), we investigated the effects of pharmacologic concentrations (32) of SAHA on replication fork
progression, replication initiation, and DNA integrity in human cells. We also studied the contribution of HDAC3 to the
effects of SAHA on DNA replication.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
MCF-7 and HCT116 cells were cultured in DMEM and
MDA-MB-231 cells in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) with
10% FCS (Gemini Bioproducts). Human peripheral lymphocytes from healthy donors were obtained from the NIH
Blood Bank and maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS.

membrane with a semidry apparatus overnight at 4 V. Membranes were blocked in 6% milk and 0.2% Tween 20. The
γH2AX antibody (Upstate-Millipore) was used at a 1:2,000
dilution, the H3K9ac antibody (Upstate-Millipore) at 1:2,500
dilution, and the thymidylate synthase (TS) antibody (Thermo
Scientific) at 1:100 dilution. Antibodies against ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) RR1 and RR2 were from Chemicon
International (Upstate-Millipore) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. Antibody signals were detected with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce).
Immunofluorescence microscopy
Cells were grown with 1 mL medium in four-well chamber
slides (Nalge-Nunc International), and staining was performed as described (33). γH2AX antibody was used at
1:2,000 dilution followed by anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) diluted 1:500. Phospho-53BP1-Ser1778 was detected
with a primary antibody from Cell Signaling diluted 1:400, followed by secondary anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 antibody
(Invitrogen).
DNA replication foci were visualized by incorporation of
chlorodeoxyuridine (CldU) and iododeoxyuridine (IdU) as
described (33). Briefly, cells were pulse labeled with 100
μmol/L IdU and CldU (Sigma), washed with PBS, fixed with
cold 70% ethanol, and stored at 4°C. Primary anti-CldU (Accurate Chemical Scientific) and anti–IdU-FITC (BD Pharmingen) antibodies were diluted 1:200, added to the
slides, and incubated in a humid environment for 2 hours.
Secondary antibodies for CldU and IdU were donkey antirat Alexa Fluor 594 and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488,
respectively (Molecular Probes), used at 1:500 dilution.
Images were visualized with a Nikon Eclipse TE-300 confocal microscope (33).
COMET assays
Neutral COMET assays were performed (Trevigen) after
electrophoresis at 4°C. Tail lengths were measured with
Comet IV program, and data were transferred into SigmaPlot
9.0 software to generate the box plot histogram.

siRNA transfections
siRNA was prepared in 750 μL RPMI 1640 (80 nmol/L final
concentration) and mixed with 750 μL RPMI 1640 containing
3 μL Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Reagents (Invitrogen) in a sixwell plate. The mixture was incubated for 30 minutes before
addition of 105 MDA-MB-231 cells in 1.5 mL RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS for an additional 72 hours.

Single DNA molecule analyses of replicons
Molecular combing was performed as described (33, 34).
Briefly, at the end of the CldU pulse, trypsinized cells were embedded in low-melting agarose plugs. After digestion with
β-agarase (New England Biolabs), DNA was combed on silanized
surfaces (Microsurfaces, Inc.) and replicons were detected
with anti-IdU and anti-CldU antibodies (33). Images were captured with the software Attovision using the epifluorescence
microscope Pathway (Becton Dickinson). Signals were measured using ImageJ (open source from National Cancer Institute, NIH) with custom-made modifications.

Western blotting and antibodies
Cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μL lysis buffer [1%
SDS, 10 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 40 μL of 25× protease inhibitors
(Roche), 10 μL phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma), 1 mL water].
Total cell lysates (10–30 μg) were loaded in 4% to 20% Trisglycine gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose

Replication of nascent strand protocol
Nascent strand protocol was carried out as previously described with few variations (35). Briefly, MCF-7 cells were
treated with 1.25 or 10 μmol/L SAHA for an hour before harvesting. After harvesting cells, we followed our published protocol (35). Nascent strands were then analyzed by real-time

Results
Short exposure to SAHA induces DNA damage
Because γH2AX (phosphorylated histone H2AX on Ser139)
is selectively activated by DNA damage and is a sensitive biomarker (31), we determined whether SAHA induces γH2AX
under conditions where it induces hyperacetylation. Exposure of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells to 1.25 μmol/L
SAHA revealed hyperacetylation within 2 hours, as shown

4472

by the increased acetylation of histone H3 at Lys9 (H3K9ac;
Fig. 1A, left). Increased γH2AX was also detectable after
2-hour treatment, but the signal was more robust and consistent after 4 hours (Fig. 1A, left). To investigate whether the
γH2AX induction was dose dependent, MCF-7 cells were
treated for 4 hours with increasing SAHA concentrations
from 1.25 to 10 μmol/L. On Western blot, H3K9ac increased
with increasing SAHA concentration (Fig. 1B, left).
To further show the γH2AX DNA damage response induced by SAHA, we used immunofluorescence microscopy
because it is more sensitive than Western blotting, as it
can detect an isolated double-strand break (DSB; ref. 31).
Figure 1A and B (right) shows that γH2AX was induced
in focal pattern, which is typical of cells experiencing
DNA damage response (31). The number of γH2AX-positive

cells and the number of γH2AX foci per nucleus increased
with increasing the SAHA concentration and exposure time
(Fig. 1A–C).
Another breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231, which is p53
mutant and triple negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and epidermal growth factor receptor 2, also
showed γH2AX induction in response to SAHA (Fig. 1D, left).
Similarly, we found induction of γH2AX in human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells (Fig. 1D, right), confirming the induction
of DNA damage by SAHA in different cancer cell lines.
SAHA can be released from its binding site on HDAC when
removed from treated cells, thus allowing deacetylation
(36). To further characterize the SAHA-induced DNA damage
response, histone acetylation and γH2AX were monitored
after drug removal following 4-hour treatments with 1.25
or 10 μmol/L SAHA. Acetylation of H3K9 diminished as early
as 20 minutes after SAHA removal and returned back to normal within 1 hour (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). γH2AX
levels also decreased within 1 or 2 hours (Supplementary
Fig. S1C). Immunofluorescence analysis showed that the
average γH2AX intensity per positive cell decreased rapidly
after drug removal, which correlates with Western blotting
results. However, γH2AX-positive cells persisted for at least
4 hours (Supplementary Fig. S1D), suggesting that some DNA
damage repair requires a long time frame.

γH2AX was initially described as a marker for DNA DSBs
(37). However, a growing body of evidence suggests that
γH2AX can also appear when the cells experience damages
other than DSBs (31). To address whether the SAHA-induced
γH2AX foci correspond to DSBs, we looked for colocalization
of the γH2AX foci with phosphorylated 53BP1 foci, another
marker for DSBs. MCF-7 cells were treated for 4 hours with
10 μmol/L SAHA or 1 μmol/L camptothecin [known to induce replication-associated DSBs (38) and used as positive
control]. As for camptothecin, phospho-53BP1 colocalized
with the γH2AX foci in SAHA-treated cells (Fig. 2A). To test
directly for DSBs, we performed neutral COMET assays,
which detect broken DNA. COMET tail length and tail moment increased in response to SAHA (Fig. 2B–D), thus confirming the induction of DSBs.
Replication dependence of SAHA-induced DNA damage
To assess the contribution of DNA replication to SAHAinduced DNA damage, we first tested whether the γH2AX foci
colocalized with replication factories (7, 33). Cells were treated
with SAHA for 4 hours and pulse labeled with CldU to detect
replication factories by immunofluorescence microscopy
(33). Eighty percent of the γH2AX foci colocalized with replication factories (labeled with CldU), and ∼50% of the replication
factories were γH2AX positive in SAHA-treated cells (Fig. 3A).

HDAC Affects Replication Velocity and Dormant Origins

The functional relationship between DNA replication and
γH2AX was further examined under conditions where DNA
replication was inhibited with aphidicolin (see pulse-labeling
experiment in Fig. 3C showing reduction of CldU incorporation and accumulation of cells at the G1-S boundary in the
presence of aphidicolin; ref. 38). Cotreatment with 1 μmol/L
aphidicolin reduced the γH2AX signal after 4-hour exposure
to SAHA (Fig. 3B) under conditions where aphidicolin by itself
did not induce γH2AX foci (7). These results provide further
evidence for the induction of replication-associated DNA
damage by SAHA.
Because we observed some γH2AX-positive MCF-7 cells
that did not stain for replication factories, we assessed
γH2AX induction by SAHA in nonreplicating cells. To do
so, we treated postmitotic circulating human lymphocytes
with SAHA and looked for γH2AX by immunofluorescence
microscopy (39). On average, two γH2AX foci per cell were
visible after 6-hour treatment with 5 μmol/L SAHA (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) analysis also showed an increase in the percentage
of γH2AX-positive cells, which was reduced when cells were
treated with the transcription inhibitor flavopiridol (Supplementary Fig. S2B; ref. 39). Together, these results show that
SAHA can induce both replication- and transcriptiondependent DNA damage. In the remaining part of this
study, we chose to focus on the effects of SAHA on DNA
replication.
SAHA alters DNA synthesis
Because our data show that SAHA induces DSBs and activates the DNA damage response in replication factories,
FACS analyses with pulse labeling were performed to monitor DNA replication in SAHA-treated cells. As before, MCF-7
cells were treated for 4 hours with SAHA but replication was
also monitored by pulse labeling with IdU, a thymidine
analogue, during the last 5 minutes of the SAHA treatment.
FACS analysis with anti-IdU antibodies detected the cells
that were replicating during drug treatment. Aphidicolin
was used as positive control for replication inhibition (Fig. 3C,
second panel from left). The FACS and IdU profiles of SAHAtreated cells showed a small but consistent decrease of the
intensity of IdU incorporation. The effect was also observed
with 3-minute IdU pulses (data not shown) and was most
obvious at 10 μmol/L SAHA (Fig. 3C).
Because histone hyperacetylation (H3K9ac) and DNA
damage (γH2AX) responses were apparent at 4 hours, and
SAHA only minimally reduced deoxynucleotide triphosphate
(dNTP) incorporation under these conditions, we investigated the dynamics of DNA replication by studying the effects
of SAHA on replication factories [i.e., the nuclear sites where
replication origins fire together (7, 33, 40)]. To visualize those
factories, cells were pulse labeled with IdU for 45 minutes.
After which, the cells were released in fresh medium with
or without SAHA for either 4 hours or 45 minutes. During
the last 45 minutes, replication factories were labeled again
but this time with CldU (see scheme in Fig. 3D; refs. 30, 33).
In untreated cells (control), the same replication factories
were labeled with both IdU and CldU when the two pulses

www.aacrjournals.org

immediately followed each other (45 min; yellow dots on
the merge images in the right panels in Fig. 3D). On the
other hand, each of the two pulses labeled different replication factories when the IdU label was conducted 4 hours
before the CldU label because the replication factories labeled during the first pulse had completed their replication
at the time of the second pulse. Figure 3D (right; 4-h time
points) shows that SAHA-treated cells show no detectable
inhibition in the activation of new replication factories.
However, we noticed a consistent increase in the intensity
of the second pulse and the presence of yellow signals in
the cells treated with SAHA for 4 hours (Fig. 3D), which
suggested that SAHA might affect replication initiation
and fork velocity (see below).
SAHA reduces fork velocity
To test the effects of SAHA on replication fork velocity and
origin firing, we used a single DNA molecule approach based
on DNA combing (2, 4, 30, 41, 42). Asynchronous MCF-7 cells
were treated with 1.5 or 10 μmol/L SAHA for 4 hours and
pulsed with IdU during the last 20 minutes of the treatment.
After drug removal, cells were washed and pulsed for 20
minutes with fresh medium containing CldU (Fig. 4A). After
combing the genomic DNA, newly replicated regions were
detected with specific fluorescent antibodies against IdU
and CldU. Figure 4B shows typical signals for three different
replicons. The replication signals were then measured, and
fork velocity was calculated for the signals that had similar
length for the IdU and CldU signals (30).
Significant shortening of both the IdU- and CldU-labeled
tracks was observed in the SAHA-treated samples compared
with untreated cells. The median velocity in MCF-7 cells
went from ∼0.8 kb/min in control cells to 0.54 and 0.4 kb/
min in cells treated with 1.5 and 10 μmol/L SAHA, respectively (Fig. 4B). These results show that SAHA reduces replication fork velocity.
Because previous studies showed decreased TS expression
after prolonged exposure to high doses of trichostatin A and
SAHA (43), and reduction fork velocity on inhibition of RNR
(4), we looked at the levels of TS and RNR on exposure of
MCF-7 cells to SAHA (Fig. 4C). TS and the RNR subunits
RR1 and RR2 remained relatively unaffected by SAHA during
the 4-hour exposure conditions used to study replication fork
velocity. These results are consistent with our prior FACS
analysis, showing only small reduction of IdU incorporation
in MCF-7 cells treated with SAHA under similar conditions
(see Fig. 3C). Therefore, the reduction in fork progression observed by molecular combing after 4-hour exposure to SAHA
is not due to reduced dNTP synthesis but rather to effects of
SAHA on chromatin.
HDAC3 downregulation also reduces replication
fork velocity
Because SAHA is a pan-HDACi with multiple protein targets (22), we compared the effects of SAHA with those of histone hyperacetylation by silencing HDAC3 (Fig. 5A), which
has recently been shown to be involved in DNA damage
control and cell cycle progression (44). IdU incorporation

significantly reduced by HDAC3 siRNA (0.8 kb/min) compared with untreated controls (1.3 kb/min; Fig. 5C), which
is also consistent with the reduction of fork velocity in response to SAHA (see Fig. 4). These results implicate HDAC3
in the regulation of fork velocity and suggest that HDAC3 is

HDAC Affects Replication Velocity and Dormant Origins

one of the targets of SAHA with respect to replication fork
slow down.
SAHA treatment and HDAC3 depletion both activate
dormant origins of replication
Interorigin distance is generally positively correlated with
fork velocity (2, 4, 30). When the distance between two neighboring origins increases, the speed of the two forks emanating from those origins also increases. Conversely, as fork
velocity decreases, the distance between origins tends to be
shorter (2, 4, 30, 45).
Interorigin distances were determined by molecular combing (Fig. 6A and B; ref. 30). Figure 6B shows reduction of the
average interorigin distance in cells treated with SAHA compared with untreated cells, indicating that replication origins
that do not normally initiate replication in untreated cells are
activated in response to SAHA. siRNA-mediated depletion of
HDAC3 also showed decreased interorigin distance (Supplementary Fig. S3), confirming the induction of new origins in
response to hyperacetylation.
To test the possibility that the increased frequency of initiation corresponded to the activation of dormant origins, we

measured replication initiation in the well-characterized human β-globin locus by PCR-based quantification of nascent
strand DNA (1, 35). The human β-globin locus contains an
active origin of replication (IR) encompassing two replicators: Rep-P and Rep-I (Fig. 6C; ref. 1). Nearby, the LCR is a
silent region that does not contain active origins and is replicated passively by the forks traveling from IR. Comparison
of the replication activity in the Rep-P and LCR region in untreated and SAHA-treated cells was performed by measuring
the abundance of short, nascent DNA strands by RT-PCR
(46). Figure 6D shows an increased abundance of nascent
strands at both the β-globin Rep-P and LCR loci in SAHAtreated cells. Therefore, the open chromatin status induced
by SAHA seems to facilitate the activation of dormant replication origins (such as the LCR locus).

Discussion
Here, we show that SAHA induces replication-associated
DNA damage within 4 hours of exposure, as shown by the
appearance of γH2AX and phospho-53BP1 foci colocalizing
with replication foci, as well as by the appearance of

COMET-positive cells indicative of DSBs. Those effects of
SAHA are induced at therapeutically relevant concentrations,
as oral administrations result in plasma concentrations between 1 and 2 μmol/L for ∼4 hours (32). The DSBs induced by
SAHA are detectable within 4 hours of drug exposure and are
not the consequence of apoptosis, which is generally observed at least 1 day after exposure to SAHA (22). In addition,
the SAHA-induced γH2AX response was characterized by
well-defined nuclear foci within replication factories, whereas the γH2AX apoptotic signal does not form foci but rather
an intense diffuse peripheral staining of the nuclei, which is
referred to as the “apoptotic ring” (47, 48). Moreover, under
our experimental conditions (4-h treatment), we did not detect other common signs of apoptosis, such as poly(ADPribose) polymerase cleavage, the appearance of stress vesicles
or detachment of the cells, nor change in the sub-G1 area in
the FACS cell cycle profiles (even at 24 h after SAHA treatment; Supplementary Fig. S4).
DNA replication–dependent damage occurs when replication forks are blocked and not efficiently stabilized and
repaired. Fork arrests have been extensively studied with
different agents, such as hydroxyurea that inhibits RNR
and blocks replication by depriving DNA polymerase
of new dNTPs (4), methyl methanesulfonate that reduces
fork progression and origin firing by alkylating DNA (49),
aphidicolin that directly inhibits replicative DNA polymerases (4, 7, 11), and camptothecins that induce fork
arrest by trapping topoisomerase I and generating replication-associated DSBs with polymerase runoff (33, 38). Those
agents, despite their different mechanisms of action, all

inhibit DNA replication and induce γH2AX (31). Typically,
cells treated with the above replication inhibitors show
an enrichment of cells arrested in S phase and inhibition of
thymidine incorporation. By contrast, SAHA induces γH2AX
without detectable alteration in cell cycle progression, without significant reduction of dNTP incorporation, and without
alteration of TS or RNR suggesting lack of checkpoint response (33). Thus, SAHA-induced DNA replication damage
is likely the consequence of chromatin hyperacetylation,
which in turn interferes with replication initiation and
fork progression.
The similarities between the effects of SAHA and HDAC3 silencing by siRNA indicate the relevance of HDAC3 for the cellular effects of SAHA. Our results are consistent with a recent
study (44) showing the induction of S-phase–dependent and
replication-dependent γH2AX induction and DNA damage
in HDAC3−/− murine embryo fibroblasts. In that study (44),
SAHA was also shown to activate γH2AX at 24 hours. Our
study extends those findings by showing that γH2AX activation takes place within 4 hours of SAHA exposure and is unrelated to apoptosis. We also performed the first single-molecule
analyses of DNA replication in HDAC3-downregulated cells
and show that HDAC3 downregulation reduces replication
velocity and increases origin firing.
Histone acetylation-deacetylation is a dynamic and reversible process that enables chromatin to adapt to DNA replication and transcription. Histone acetylation opens up
chromatin by neutralizing the positive charges of lysines
and by promoting the binding of bromodomain-containing
proteins; both of which enable the loading of DNA processing

HDAC Affects Replication Velocity and Dormant Origins

enzymes. Hyperacetylation facilitates both the removal of
histones from the DNA template and the reloading of histone
on newly replicated DNA (9, 10, 13–18). Deacetylation of newly
incorporated histones also plays a major role in chromatin
maturation (9, 18, 19). A recent study shows that a large
number of chromatin proteins are acetylated (20). Histones
represent only a small fraction of those proteins. Among the
chromatin proteins relevant to the present study, Choudhary
and coworkers (20) found 52 replication proteins acetylated
on 98 sites (including the replication helicases MCM2-6, DNA
polymerase, Geminin, Timeless, and Claspin), 26 chromatin
remodeling proteins acetylated on 46 sites (including SWI/
SNF, NURD, INO80, and NURF), 46 DNA/RNA helicases acetylated on 105 sites, and 132 cell cycle proteins acetylated on
243 sites. Thus, it is likely that the replication defects induced
by HDAC3 knockdown and SAHA result from targeting a
broad range of chromatin-associated protein complexes.
Fork velocity and interorigin distance are linearly correlated (2, 4), and it has generally been proposed that velocity regulates firing. Indeed, in the case of dNTP depletion and DNA
polymerase and topoisomerase I inhibition, reduction of fork
velocity is associated with activation of dormant origins
(4, 33, 45). Because SAHA alters replication without affecting
RNR and TS levels, its effects on fork velocity are likely to be
due to chromatin changes rather than by alteration of the
dNTP pools. Accordingly, the induction of DSBs and γH2AX
foci in replication factories by SAHA suggests that SAHA in-

duces DNA damage that arrests replication forks. It is, however, not excluded that histone hyperacetylation by SAHA
can activate dormant origins by facilitating chromatin opening and hyperacetylation of replication complexes (20), which
could increase the risk of replication fork encounters, leading
to their collapse and thereby reduced fork progression.
From a clinical viewpoint, our study shows that DNA
damage can take place in response to SAHA and that such
DNA damage needs to be considered for the clinical use
and future development of HDAC inhibitors. γH2AX could
be used as a convenient pharmacodynamic biomarker for
HDAC inhibitors (31).
