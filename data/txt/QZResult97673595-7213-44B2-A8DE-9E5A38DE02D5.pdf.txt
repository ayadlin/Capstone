Abstract
Lymphomas originate in and spread primarily along the lymphatic system. However, whether lymphatic vessels
contribute to the growth and spreading of lymphomas is largely unclear. Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) represents
an aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We found that MCL exhibited abundant intratumor lymphatic vessels.
Our results demonstrated that the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide potently inhibited the growth and
dissemination of MCL in a xenograft MCL mouse model, at least in part, by inhibiting functional tumor
lymphangiogenesis. Signiﬁcant numbers of tumor-associated macrophages expressing vascular endothelial
growth factor-C were found in both human MCL and mouse MCL xenograft samples. Lenalidomide treatment
resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in the number of MCL-associated macrophages. In addition, in vivo depletion of
monocytes/macrophages impaired functional tumor lymphangiogenesis and inhibited MCL growth and dissemination. Taken together, our results indicate that tumor lymphangiogenesis contributes to the progression of
MCL and that lenalidomide is effective in decreasing MCL growth and metastasis most likely by inhibiting
recruitment of MCL-associated macrophages. Cancer Res; 73(24); 7254–64. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of lymphoid malignancies that originate in the lymphatic system (1). However,
whether lymphatic vessels contribute to the growth and
spreading of lymphomas is largely unclear. Increased expression of the lymphangiogenic factor, vascular endothelial
growth factor-C (VEGF-C), and increased lymphatic vessel
density have been found in several lymphoma subtypes, including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), an aggressive form of
lymphoma (2). MCL is the most difﬁcult type of lymphoma
to treat, which is due in part to its frequent dissemination (3). It
is unclear whether and how lymphangiogenesis contributes to
the growth and dissemination of MCL.

Recent clinical studies have indicated that the immunomodulatory compound lenalidomide (LEN), either alone or in
combination with the CD20 antibody rituximab, has signiﬁcant
effects in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma including MCL (4–7).
Multiple antitumor mechanisms of action of LEN have been
implicated, including immunomodulatory, anti-inﬂammatory,
antiproliferative, and antiangiogenic effects (8–13). However,
few studies have explored whether LEN affects tumor growth
and spreading by inhibiting lymphangiogenesis (14, 15).
In this study, abundant intratumor lymphatic vessels were
found in MCL samples from patients and in an experimental
mouse MCL xenograft lymphoma model. LEN blocked tumor
lymphangiogenesis and inhibited the initiation, progression,
and dissemination of MCL in mouse MCL xenografts. We
found large numbers of VEGF-Cþ macrophages in MCL tumor
samples from both patients and mice, suggesting that MCLassociated macrophages play an important role in the induction of lymphangiogenesis (16–18). Consistent with this
hypothesis, LEN reduced the number of macrophages in MCL.
In addition, depletion of monocytes signiﬁcantly inhibited
lymphangiogenesis in MCL tumors and retarded MCL progression and dissemination in the mouse xenograft MCL
model. These results indicate that tumor lymphangiogenesis
contributes to the progression of MCL and that LEN decreases
MCL growth and metastasis most likely by inhibiting recruitment of MCL-associated macrophages.

Materials and Methods

Anti-Lymphangiogenesis by Lenalidomide in MCL

in RPMI-1640 (ATCC) supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% fungizone, penicillin, and streptomycin
(Sigma). LEN was provided by Celgene and dissolved in
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 250 mg/mL
as a stock solution. For in vivo injection, LEN was prepared as
a 2.5 mg/mL solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
containing 1% DMSO (20).
Xenograft mouse models of MCL
Eight-week-old male immunodeﬁcient NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wj1/SzJ mice (NSG; Jackson Laboratory) were housed
in a speciﬁc pathogen-free mouse facility (21). Mino cells (6 
106/100 mL) were injected subcutaneously into both ﬂanks of
each NSG mouse near the inguinal lymph node regions. When
palpable tumors developed (10 days after inoculation of Mino
cells), the mice were randomized into 2 groups and injected
intraperitoneally with either LEN (50 mg/kg) or vehicle (1%
DMSO in PBS, sham treated; ref. 10) and were subsequently
given a daily intraperitoneally injection of the same amount of
LEN or vehicle control for 4 days (short-term treatment) or 21
days (long-term treatment), respectively. Primary tumor volume was measured and calculated as length  width2  0.5. At
the end of the treatment, mice were sacriﬁced, and tumors,
adjacent lymph nodes, lungs, spleen, liver, and intestine were
carefully removed for morphological analysis and immunostaining. All animal experiments were approved by the animal
care and use committee of the Oklahoma Medical Research
Foundation.
Lymphangiography
To image the lymph ﬂow from the inguinal to axillary lymph
nodes, 20 mL Evans blue dye (0.2%; Sigma) was injected into the
hindlimb footpad of each mouse. Forty-ﬁve minutes after
injection, the mice were sacriﬁced, and lymphangiography
was carried out using a dissection microscope. To determine
which lymphatic vessels drained the MCL implanted in the
inguinal lymph nodal region, the tumor-bearing mice were
anesthetized with isoﬂurane (E-Z anesthesia system; Euthanex
Corporation). A small incision was made in the ventral side of
the skin to expose the tumor. FITC-dextran (1.5  106 kDa MW;
Sigma) was then slowly injected into the tumor. The incision
was closed using sutures. Two hours after injection, a skin ﬂap
was made with the tumor near the inguinal lymph nodal areas
attached, and draining lymphatic vessels were imaged using an
Olympus SZX12 dissection ﬂuorescence microscope.
Immunoﬂuorescent staining
For immunoﬂuorescent staining of cryosections, tissues
were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in OCT
compound (Sakura Finetek). Cryosections (20 mm in thickness)
were blocked with 0.3% Triton X-100, 3% donkey serum, 3%
goat serum, and 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS and
incubated overnight at 4 C with the indicated combinations
of the following primary antibodies: Syrian hamster antipodoplanin (clone 8.1.1), rat anti-mouse CD31 (clone MEC13.3;
BD Biosciences), rat anti-mouse CD105 (clone MJ7/18;
eBioscience), rat anti-mouse F4/80 (Life Technologies), biotinylated rat anti-mouse CD11b (clone M1/70; BD Biosciences),

www.aacrjournals.org

biotinylated goat anti-LYVE-1 (clone BAF2125; R&D Systems),
mouse anti-human CD68 (clone KP1; eBioscience), rabbit antiVEGF-C (Abcam), and rat anti-human CD20 (clone L26;
Abcam). After washing in PBS, sections were incubated with
the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa
Fluor (AF)-488, DyLight (DL)-549, or DL-649 (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The sections were mounted with mounting
medium with or without 4,6 diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI;
Invitrogen) and analyzed with confocal scanning microscopy
using a DSU spinning-disk head mounted on an Olympus IX81
inverted microscope with a Hamamatsu ORCA-R2 camera.
Images were analyzed using Slidebook 5.0 (Intelligent Imaging
Innovations) and are shown as maximum intensity projections
of the z-stacks. For quantiﬁcation of positive staining with the
lymphatic marker LYVE-1 and the pan-endothelial marker
CD31, a minimum of 6 randomly chosen ﬁelds (10 magniﬁcation) of each tumor region (peri, peripheral, and central
region) were evaluated (22). For whole-mount staining, the
ﬁxed tissues were washed and blocked with 0.3% Triton X-100,
3% donkey serum, 3% goat serum, and 3% BSA in PBS and
immunostained using the following primary antibodies: Syrian
hamster anti-mouse podoplanin (clone 8.1.1) and rat antiCD20 (clone L26; Abcam). Goat F(ab')2 anti-Syrian hamster
immunoglobulin G (IgG) conjugated to DL-649 or donkey antirat IgG conjugated to DL-549 were used as secondary
antibodies.
Histology and immunohistochemical staining
Parafﬁn-embedded tissue sections (5 mm in thickness) were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or were immunohistochemically stained (IHC). IHC was performed as follows:
sections were deparafﬁnized and rehydrated, endogenous
peroxidase activity was quenched with 3% H2O2 for 10 minutes,
antigen retrieval was performed using antigen unmasking
solution (Vector Laboratories), and nonspeciﬁc binding was
blocked with nonspeciﬁc protein block (Dako) for 1 hour. The
slides were incubated with primary antibody against podoplanin (clone D2-40; AngioBio), CD34 (Dako), or VEGFR-3 (Dako)
at 4 C overnight. After washing, sections were incubated with
anti-Syrian hamster secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactivity was visualized using a
peroxidase-diaminobenzidine kit (Vector Laboratories).
Immunoblotting
Tumor tissue lysates were used. For immunoblotting, antipodoplanin (clone 8.1.1), anti-Prox1 (Abcam), anti-VEGFR-2
(R&D Systems), anti-VEGFR-3 (R&D Systems), anti-CCL5 (Cell
Signaling), and anti-GAPDH (Cell Signaling) were each used at
a dilution of 1:1,000. Horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antirabbit, anti-Syrian hamster, anti-goat, or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were each used at a
1:5,000 dilution. The membranes were developed with SuperSignal West Pico Kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc).
Real-time PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted from MCL xenografts or cultured
Mino cells using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen), according to
the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was reversely

(SABiosciences) with speciﬁc primer sets 50 -GCTGTCATCCTCATTGCTACTG-30 and 50 -TGGTGTAGAAATACTCCTTGATGTG-30 for human CCL5 (Integrated DNA Technologies).
Ampliﬁcation and detection of mRNA were performed using
the CFX96 Real-Time Detection System (Bio-Rad) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. To standardize mRNA concentrations, transcript levels of 18S RNA were determined in
parallel for each sample, and relative transcript levels were
corrected by normalization based on 18S transcripts.

and CD31, a pan-endothelial marker. Our results demonstrated
that MCL tumors contained increased number of LYVE-1þ,
podoplaninþ, and CD31low lymphatic vessels in the peri- and
peripheral regions of the tumor (Fig. 1C and D and data not
shown) in comparison with the lymphatic vascular density in
the negative controls (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B), which
was the mantle zone of normal nonreactive lymph nodes (24).
The lymphatic vessels in the peripheral regions seemed to have
open lumens (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Fig. S1C). Most lymphatic vessels were found in the tumor peripheral region (Fig. 1E),
as measured by the depth of lymphatic vessel inﬁltration (25),
and the central region rarely had any lymphatic vessels.

Cell migration assay
Mino cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 10
mmol/L LEN for 3 days (23). Same amounts of pretreated Mino
cells (5.4  105/mL) were washed with Hank's Balanced Salt
Solution and then cultured with serum-free media for 24 hours.
Conditioned media was collected and added to the lower
compartment of a transwell (5 mm pore size; Corning). 105 of
starved murine macrophages, which were isolated from bone
marrow of NSG mice and maintained in RPMI1640 medium
containing 20% FBS and 10 ng/mL M-CSF (R&D Systems), were
seeded in the upper compartment of a transwell. In some
experiments, a neutralizing antibody against CCL5 or isotype
control (16 mg/mL; R&D Systems) was added to the conditioned media from sham-treated Mino cells. After 4 hours at
37 C, migrated macrophages were stained and quantiﬁed.

LEN inhibits lymphangiogenesis in MCL
Clinical trials have shown that LEN has signiﬁcant activities
in MCL (6). However, whether LEN inhibits lymphangiogenesis
is unclear. Thus, we investigated whether LEN treatment
affects MCL tumor lymphangiogenesis in the mouse xenograft
MCL model. We observed a dramatic reduction in lymphatic
vessel density (Fig. 1C and D) and lymphatic vessel depth of
inﬁltration (Fig. 1C–E) in LEN-treated tumors as compared
with sham-treated tumors. To further corroborate the
effects of LEN on lymphangiogenesis in MCL, we examined
the levels of lymphatic markers in MCL tumors with immunoblotting. Consistent with reduced lymphatic vessel density in MCL tumors after LEN treatment, Western blotting
detected reduced levels of murine Prox-1, podoplanin, and
VEGFR-3, 3 lymphatic vessels associated proteins, in LENtreated tumor samples as compared with sham-treated
samples (Fig. 1F).

Macrophage depletion
MCL tumor-bearing NSG mice were intravenously administered 100 mL plain liposomes (control) or clodronate-encapsulated liposomes (clodroplip, FormuMax), which deplete
monocytes/macrophages, every 4 days for 16 days to determine
whether macrophages are indispensible for tumor lymphangiogenesis. The efﬁciency of macrophage depletion was measured using ﬂow cytometry of peripheral whole blood that had
been stained with anti-CD115 (clone AFS98; eBioscience) 5
days after initial administration of liposomes.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Student t test.
Differences were considered statistically signiﬁcant at P < 0.05.

Results
MCL tumors exhibit abundant intratumor lymphatic
vessels
To explore the role of lymphatic vessels in MCL development, we characterized the lymphatic vessel density of primary
tumors from MCL patient samples and mouse MCL xenografts.
Immunostaining for VEGFR-3 and podoplanin, which are
lymphatic vessel markers, revealed abundant intratumor lymphatic vessels in human MCL samples (Fig. 1A).
To determine whether intratumor lymphatic vascular density correlates with MCL development, we analyzed different
regions (peritumor, peripheral and central tumor regions, Fig.
1B) of mouse xenograft MCL tumors using antibodies to LYVE1, podoplanin, and/or VEGFR-3, 3 lymphatic vessel markers,

LEN treatment inhibits tumor growth and dissemination
in a xenograft mouse model of MCL
To determine whether LEN affects the progression of MCL
in our MCL xenograft model, we examined development of
LEN- or sham-treated tumors. Gross morphological analysis
revealed that LEN treatment resulted in signiﬁcant growth
retardation of MCL xenografts as compared with the shamtreated group (Fig. 2A and B).
To determine whether LEN affects MCL dissemination, we
injected Mino cells into the inguinal lymph nodal region (Fig.
2C) of NSG mice to determine whether the tumor cells spread
to axillary lymph nodes, which drain the inguinal region.
Thirty-ﬁve days after tumor cell injection, gross analysis
revealed that axillary lymph nodes were signiﬁcantly enlarged
in sham-treated MCL tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 2D). In contrast, few LEN-treated, MCL tumor-bearing mice had enlarged
axillary lymph nodes. Because the NSG mice do not have
lymphocytes, the enlarged axillary lymph nodes in shamtreated mice were primarily resulted from disseminated MCL
cells and inﬁltrated inﬂammatory cells as demonstrated by
histology and immunoﬂuorescence staining (Figs. 2E and F
and 4B). In contrast, few tumor cells were detected in the
axillary lymph nodes of LEN-treated mice. In addition, significantly more lung dissemination was found in sham-treated
mice as compared with the LEN-treated group. In the shamtreated group, MCL spreading was occasionally detected in the
spleen and rarely detected in other organs, such as the liver or

LEN-treated mice (Supplementary Fig. S2).
LEN treatment results in nonfunctional tumor
lymphangiogenesis
To determine the functionality of tumor lymphatic vessels,
we ﬁrst measured the uptake and transport of intratumorinjected FITC-dextran by lymphatic vessels. Immunoﬂuorescence staining revealed that FITC-dextran–ﬁlled LYVE-1þ
lymphatic vessels were frequently found in the sham-treated
tumors. However, most lymphatic vessels did not contain
FITC-dextran in LEN-treated tumors (Fig. 3A and B). Confocal
imaging analyses of MCL samples demonstrated that human
CD20þ tumor cells were frequently found inside lymphatic
vascular structures in sham-treated but rarely in LEN-treated
tumors (Fig. 3C and D). Together, these data support that LEN
treatment results in nonfunctional tumor lymphangiogenesis
that likely inhibits tumor cell dissemination through lymphatic
vessels.
LEN inhibits MCL spreading through lymphatic vessels
We observed that MCL inoculated in the inguinal lymph
nodal region often disseminated into the axillary lymph

nodes (Fig. 2C–F). Lymphangiography performed with Evans
blue dye demonstrated a major lymphatic vessel draining
the inguinal lymph nodal region into the axillary lymph
nodes (Supplementary Fig. S3). To test whether MCL cells
spread through this lymphatic route, we injected FITCdextran into the interstitial space of MCL tumors that were
developed after inoculation of Mino cells in the inguinal
lymph nodal region and then monitored the transport of the
injected FITC-dextran. We found that, in sham-treated mice,
FITC-dextran injected into the MCL tumor ﬁlled in the
draining collecting lymphatic vessels that lead to the axillary
lymph nodes; this did not occur in LEN-treated mice (Fig. 3E;
Supplementary Fig. S4A). In addition, immunostaining
revealed that CD20þ tumor cells were within or associated
with LYVE-1þ tumor peripheral lymphatic vessels (Fig. 3F)
and in the lymphatic sinuses of axillary lymph nodes (Supplementary Fig. S4B) of sham-treated mice but were rarely
observed in these locations in LEN-treated, MCL tumorbearing mice (Fig. 3F). Functional lymphangiography demonstrated an equivalent rate of transportation of the Evans
blue dye through the collecting lymphatic vessels in LENtreated mice nontumor bearing mice, compared with shamtreated group (Supplementary Fig. S3). And no substantial

change was observed in lymphatic vessel density in the
intestine, lung, and skin of mice treated with LEN relative
to sham-treated mice (Supplementary Fig. S2). These results
suggest that LEN treatment impairs functional tumor lymphangiogenesis but not the function of preexisting host
lymphatic vessels. Collectively, these results support that
tumor lymphatic vessels serve as an important route for
MCL tumor cell spreading and that LEN inhibits this
process.
LEN inhibits tumor lymphangiogenesis by decreasing the
number of tumor-associated VEGF-Cþ macrophages
To investigate the mechanisms by which LEN affects tumor
lymphangiogenesis, we ﬁrst examined whether LEN affects
the survival, proliferation, and motility of lymphatic endothelial cells, which are essential for lymphangiogenesis.
However, despite its multiple antitumor activities, LEN did
not affect these cellular activities of murine lymphatic
endothelial cells in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S5). Further
analyses indicate that LEN did not signiﬁcantly alter the
expression of genes related to lymphangiogenesis and
immune cell trafﬁcking, such as VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3,
E-selectin, P-selectin, PSGL-1, PIGF-2, and VE-cadherin
(15, 26, 27), in lymphatic endothelial cells (Supplementary
Fig. S6A). These results support that directly targeting

7258

Cancer Res; 73(24) December 15, 2013

lymphatic endothelial cells is not a mechanism by which
LEN inhibits MCL lymphangiogenesis.
Lymphangiogenic factor VEGF-C derived from tumorassociated macrophage and/or cancer cells are essential for
tumor lymphangiogenesis (28, 29). We found that VEGF-C
was expressed in macrophages but not in tumor cells in
human MCL samples (28.6%  2.6% of macrophages; Fig.
4A), suggesting that macrophages may be critical for lymphangiogenesis in MCL. Consistent with this ﬁnding, mouse
MCL xenografts also contained large numbers of VEGF-Cþ
cells that colocalized with the macrophage markers F4/80
and CD11b (Fig. 4B). In addition, we found that cultured
Mino cells did not express VEGF-C under either normal
culture condition or after CoCl2 treatment, which induces
hypoxic condition (Supplementary Fig. S7A). This suggests
that tumor-associated macrophages, but not tumor cells, are
the major source of VEGF-C. LEN treatment resulted in
reduced expression of VEGF-C mRNA in the MCL xenografts
(Supplementary Fig. S7A). Immunoﬂuorescence staining
revealed that large numbers of F4/80þCD11bþVEGF-Cþ
macrophages were detected in the peripheral regions of
sham-treated but not LEN-treated tumors (Fig. 4B and C;
Supplementary Fig. S7B and S7C). These results support that
LEN attenuates VEGF-C expression by decreasing tumorassociated macrophages.

LEN inhibits the recruitment of tumor-associated

Inﬁltrated monocytes/macrophages play important roles
in the promotion of tumor angiogenesis/lymphangiogenesis
(27, 30). We then asked how LEN inhibits tumor-inﬁltrating
macrophages. Initial semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis

demonstrated that LEN did not signiﬁcantly alter the
expression of genes related to the recruitment of monocytes/macrophages in macrophages (Supplementary Fig.

ranked on top of genes that were signiﬁcantly downregulated
in LEN-treated samples relative to sham-treated (Fig. 4D;

result in a similar anti-MCL effect. To test this, we depleted
monocyte/macrophages in MCL tumor-bearing mice with
clodronate encapsulated in liposomes (clodrolip; ref. 37). Flow
cytometric analysis of CD115, a monocyte/macrophage marker on peripheral blood cells, demonstrated that clodrolip
treatment resulted in an 86.5% reduction in CD115þ cells (Fig.
5A). Consistent with this result, F4/80 staining in clodroliptreated tumors demonstrated a signiﬁcant reduction in the
number of tumor-associated macrophages, which was accompanied by reduced tumor growth (Fig. 5B and C; Supplementary Fig. S9). A signiﬁcant impairment in the function and the
number of intratumor lymphatic vessels after clodrolip treatment was observed as compared with the control group (Fig.
5D–F). Moreover, clodrolip-treated mice exhibited reduced
spreading of MCL xenografts into the axillary lymph nodes
and lungs as compared with the control liposome treatment
(Fig. 5G and H and data not shown). Together, these results
indicate that clodrolip-mediated depletion of tumor-associated macrophages signiﬁcantly blocks functional tumor lymphangiogenesis and subsequently impairs the growth and
dissemination of MCL.

Discussion
Lymphangiogenesis during tumor growth and metastasis
has been an emerging focus of vascular biology in recent years
(27). However, whether and how lymphatic vessels contribute
to dissemination of lymphoma remains unclear. Our study
provides novel and deﬁnitive evidence to support that (i) MCLs
in preclinical models have heightened lymphangiogenesis
compared with the mantle zone of normal lymph nodes; (ii)
LEN attenuates lymphatic spreading by reducing functional
lymphangiogenesis; and (iii) the anti-lymphangiogenic
mechanisms of LEN are, at least partly, mediated by reducing
the number of tumor-inﬁltrating macrophages and their production of VEGF-C. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report on
the novel therapeutic anti-lymphangiogenic mechanism of
LEN in lymphoma and highlights the potential pathogenic
role of lymphangiogenesis in lymphoma progression and
dissemination.
Anti-lymphangiogenic agents may have therapeutic potential in a variety of malignancy types. Currently, anti-lymphatic
strategies target primarily the signaling induced by VEGF-C
and its receptor, VEGFR-3. A VEGFR-3–targeting monoclonal
antibody, IMC-3C5, has recently entered phase I clinical trials
for patients with advanced solid tumors that are refractory to
standard therapy or for which no standard therapy is available
(15). Blocking antibodies to neuropilin-2, a coreceptor for
VEGF-C, have also shown efﬁcacy in reducing lymphangiogenesis and lung metastasis in animal models (38, 39). LEN
(Revlimid), a derivative of thalidomide, was initially introduced
as a treatment for multiple myeloma. Either alone or in
combination with other drugs such as rituximab, dexamethasone, and bortezomib, LEN has proven effective in the treatment of MCL in clinical trials (3, 40, 41). Therefore, it has
recently been approved by the FDA for the treatment of
patients with relapsed or refractory MCL despite the fact that
it may potentially induce secondary cancers such as Hodgkin's
lymphoma (42, 43). These antitumor effects of LEN have been

7262

Cancer Res; 73(24) December 15, 2013

largely attributed to its cytotoxicity directly to MCL cell growth
(10, 13). Our study provides an additional mechanism of
actions for LEN. We show novel evidence supporting that LEN
attenuates tumor growth and lymphatic metastasis by reducing functional tumor lymphangiogenesis without affecting
preexisting host lymphatic vasculature. LEN inhibits lymphangiogenesis at the early stage of MCL development (Supplementary Fig. S10), supporting that LEN-mediated reduction of
lymphangiogenesis results in suppression of MCL growth and
metastasis. In addition to potent inhibition of lymphangiogenesis, LEN treatment causes nonfunctional angiogenesis in our
MCL mouse model (Supplementary Fig. S11), which is consistent with the data from a recent phase II clinical study (44).
Therefore, the anti-lymphangiogenesis and anti-angiogenesis
effects of LEN may synergistically contribute to its inhibition of
MCL growth and spreading.
Current knowledge regarding whether and how lymphatic
vessels contribute to metastasis of MCL is limited. The presence and signiﬁcance of intratumoral lymphatic vessels has
been a controversial subject (14, 22, 45, 46). In this study, we
identiﬁed intratumor lymphatic vessels in peripheral regions of
samples from both patients and mice with MCL. These vessels
seemed to have open lumens and contain tumor cells. The
intratumor lymphatic vessels in the mouse MCL xenografts
were functional as shown with FITC-dextran lymphangiography. In addition, we observed MCL tumor cells in the lymphatic
vessels that surround the primary tumor and in the axillary
lymph nodes of sham-treated mice. However, tumor cells were
not detected in these vessels in LEN-treated mice. These results
suggest that increased intratumor functional lymphangiogenesis contributes to tumor cell spreading along draining lymphatic vessels to the adjacent lymph nodes and that blocking
this process contributes to the mechanisms of the anti-MCL
action of LEN.
The tumor microenvironment inﬂuences neoplastic progression and growth (32). Nontumor stromal and inﬁltrating
immune cells, including lymphoma-associated macrophages,
have been recognized as important adverse prognostic factors
(31, 33). Consistent with this, we detected high numbers of
lymphoma-associated macrophages in MCL. The CD11bþ
macrophage subset is known to produce large amounts of
VEGF-C, which is important for lymphangiogenesis (17).
Importantly, LEN treatment reduced the recruitment of
tumor-inﬁltrating macrophages primarily at the tumor peripheral region where tumor lymphangiogenesis is active. Depletion of macrophages reduced tumor growth and metastasis.
These results reveal a novel mechanism of action for LEN in
MCL treatment and support the importance of the tumor
microenvironment in MCL progression.
