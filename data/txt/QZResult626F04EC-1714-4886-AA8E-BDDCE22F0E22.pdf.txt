Abstract

Author Manuscript

The mechanisms by which chronic inflammatory lung diseases, particularly chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), confer enhanced risk for lung cancer are not well defined. To
investigate whether nuclear factor (NF)-κB, a key mediator of immune and inflammatory
responses, provides an interface between persistent lung inflammation and carcinogenesis, we
utilized tetracycline-inducible transgenic mice expressing, constitutively active IκB kinase β in
airway epithelium (IKTA mice). Intraperitoneal injection of ethyl carbamate (urethane) or 3methylcholanthrene (MCA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was used to induce lung
tumorigenesis. Doxycycline-treated IKTA mice developed chronic airway inflammation and
markedly increased numbers of lung tumors in response to urethane, even when transgene
expression (and therefore epithelial NF-κB activation) was begun after exposure to carcinogen.
Studies using a separate tumor initiator/promoter model (MCA+BHT) indicated that NF-κB
functions as an independent tumor promoter. Enhanced tumor formation in IKTA mice was
preceded by increased proliferation and reduced apoptosis of alveolar epithelium, resulting in
increased formation of premalignant lesions. Investigation of inflammatory cells in lungs of IKTA

mice revealed a substantial increase in macrophages and lymphocytes, including functional CD4+/
CD25+/FoxP3+ regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs). Importantly, Treg depletion using repetitive
injections of anti-CD25 antibodies limited excessive tumor formation in IKTA mice. At 6 weeks
following urethane injection, antibody-mediated Treg depletion in IKTA mice reduced the number
of premalignant lesions in the lungs in association with an increase in CD8 lymphocytes. Thus,
persistent NF-κB signaling in airway epithelium facilitates carcinogenesis by sculpting the
immune/inflammatory environment in the lungs.

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is epidemic in the U.S. and worldwide, largely related to cigarette smoking
(Miller 2005; Parkin et al, 2005; Siegel et al, 2011). Among smokers, the primary risk factor
for developing lung cancer is the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) (Young et al, 2009), which is characterized by chronic pulmonary inflammation,
airway remodeling, and destruction of lung parenchyma (Barnes and Celli 2009; Rabe et al,
2007; Thiberville et al, 2009). Several studies have confirmed that COPD is an independent
risk factor for lung cancer (Skillrud et al, 1986; Tockman et al, 1987). We and others have
proposed that chronic inflammation, as occurs in COPD, could provide the mechanistic link
to explain increased lung cancer risk in these patients (Houghton et al, 2008; Moghaddam et
al, 2009; Stathopoulos et al, 2007). However, the specific inflammatory cells and pathways
involved in potentiating lung cancer risk are not well defined.

The nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway, an elegant system that executes
transcriptional responses to cell stress, regulates expression of cytokines, chemokines,
adhesion molecules, apoptosis-regulating genes, matrix metalloproteinases, enzymes, and
receptors (Blackwell and Christman 1997; Smale 2010). NF-κB is activated by a number of
tumor-promoting agents and is involved in production of proteins that enhance cell survival
and proliferation (Pahl 1999; Pasparakis 2009). In humans, NF-κB has been reported to be
activated in precancerous lesions and lung cancer specimens obtained by resection or biopsy
(Tang et al, 2006). We and others have shown that the NF-κB pathway impacts lung tumor
development in mice by enhancing epithelial cell survival in both chemical carcinogens and
genetic models (Meylan et al, 2009; Stathopoulos et al, 2007; Takahashi et al, 2010).
Despite recent interest in the role of NF-κB in lung cancer, a number of key questions
remain.
In these studies, we asked whether NF-κB provides a mechanistic link between chronic
airway inflammation and increased risk of lung carcinogenesis and if so, how persistent NFκB activation augments tumor formation. To regulate NF-κB in the lungs, we utilized
transgenic mice with inducible expression of active IκB kinase β (IKKβ) in airway epithelial
cells (IKTA mice) (Cheng et al, 2007). We found that long-term activation of NF-κB
resulted in persistent airway inflammation characterized by macrophage and lymphocyte

infiltration. Following exposure to chemical carcinogens, IKTA mice exhibited enhanced
lung tumorigenesis even when lung inflammation was induced after carcinogen exposure.
Increased tumor formation in IKTA mice was preceded by increased proliferation of airway
epithelial cells and enhanced formation of premalignant lesions. Further investigation of the
nature of the lung inflammatory cell influx of IKTA mice revealed a substantial increase in
regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs). Depletion of these cells resulted in increased numbers of
CD8 lymphocytes in the lungs and a reduction of lung tumor formation in IKTA mice.
Collectively, our findings show that chronic NF-κB-driven inflammation enhances lung
tumor formation in a paracrine manner via regulation of key immune cell populations that
impact epithelial cell proliferation and survival.

Chronic NF-κB-driven airway inflammation enhances urethane-induced lung
carcinogenesis

Author Manuscript

IKTA mice express constitutively active IKKβ in Clara cell specific protein (CCSP)expressing airway epithelium after doxycycline treatment (Cheng et al, 2007). Addition of
0.5 mg/ml of doxycycline to drinking water resulted in an early neutrophil-predominant
inflammatory cell influx during the first 2 weeks followed by a shift in the inflammatory cell
profile to a predominance of macrophages and lymphocytes by week 4 of continuous
doxycycline as identified in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (figure 1A). This chronic
inflammatory profile persisted for at least 4 months of doxycycline treatment. As indicated
in figure 1B, this shift in inflammatory pattern occurred despite consistent levels of
transgene expression in IKTA mice. Although some mice (<25%) succumbed to acute lung
inflammation during the first 2 weeks of doxycycline treatment, after this period mice
appeared healthy and active without weight loss or appearance of chronic illness.

Author Manuscript

We next investigated whether chronic airway inflammation induced by NF-κB activation
increases susceptibility to urethane-induced lung tumor formation. We treated mice with a
single IP injection of urethane and induced transgene expression by treatment with
doxycycline during three different time intervals (figure 2A): 1) beginning 2 weeks prior to
urethane and continuing for 3 weeks after urethane injection (week -2–3), 2) beginning at
week 4 post-urethane and continuing until harvest at 16 weeks (week 4–16), and 3)
beginning 2 weeks prior to urethane and continuing through week 16 after urethane (week
-2–16). Prior studies in tet-on models have shown that withdrawal of doxycycline results in
loss of transgene expression by 7 days (Perl et al, 2002). Wild type (WT) mice treated with a
similar doxycycline regimen to IKTA mice were used as controls in each experiment. Lung
tumor formation was assessed in all studies at 16 weeks after urethane injection. In the first
experiment, IKTA mice treated with doxycycline during weeks -2–3 (tumor initiation and
early promotion phase) showed increased tumor formation compared to WT mice with or
without doxycycline treatment (figure 2B). In the second experiment, IKTA mice treated
with doxycycline between weeks 4–16 post-urethane (late promotion and progression phase)
developed significantly more tumors than WT controls (figure 2C). In the third experiment,
IKTA mice treated with doxycycline for the duration of the experiment (week -2–16) showed
a similar increase in tumor numbers to that seen with the week 4–16 regimen (figure 2D).

Together, these studies show that epithelial NF-κB activation enhances tumor formation in
the lungs. Compared to IKTA mice that were treated with doxycycline during weeks -2–3,
greater tumor numbers were identified in IKTA mice treated with dox during later periods.

Author Manuscript

Additional urethane-treated WT and IKTA mice were given doxycycline throughout the
experimental period (week -2–16) to confirm the increase in lung tumors by histological
examination. Similar to surface tumors, tumor numbers were increased on lung sections
from IKTA mice compared to WT controls (figure 3A). Lung tumors appeared as solid or
papillary adenomas without features of adenocarcinoma. Morphometric analysis indicated
that the mean tumor diameters were similar between groups (figure 3B). We also evaluated
airway inflammation in tumor-containing mice by performing BAL at the time of harvest.
Urethane-treated IKTA mice showed increased BAL macrophages and lymphocytes
compared to WT controls (figure 3C), similar to the pattern of chronic inflammation
observed in prior experiments in which IKTA mice were treated with doxycycline alone
(figure 1A).
We measured cellular proliferation by 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) staining in lung tumors
from WT and IKTA mice treated with urethane and doxycycline from week -2–16. The
percentage of BrdU positive cells in tumors from WT mice was 1.7±0.4 compared to 1.9±0.6
in tumors from IKTA mice (figure 3D). This finding, together with the similarities in tumor
size and appearance, indicate that chronic NF-κB activation in our model does not
substantially influence growth and progression of established tumors. Instead, these results
support the idea that epithelial NF-κB activation affects the promotion phase of
tumorigenesis.

NF-κB can function as the sole tumor promoter and increases tumor formation
irrespective of genetic background

Author Manuscript

While urethane is a complete carcinogen, most carcinogens require a separate promoter
agent to achieve tumor formation. 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA), a component of tobacco
smoke, is a weak carcinogen that requires the addition of a separate promoter agent like
butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) to reproducibly generate tumors in mice (Malkinson et al,
1997). Prior studies have shown that BHT promotes lung tumors only in strains in which it
also induces lung inflammation (Bauer et al, 2005; Malkinson et al, 2000). We asked
whether MCA or BHT induces NF-κB activation in the lungs using NF-κB reporter mice
(HLL; FVB background) that express luciferase under the control of an NF-κB-dependent
promoter (Stathopoulos et al, 2007; Yull et al, 2003). Mice were treated with a single IP
injection of MCA or BHT. As shown in figure 4A, MCA failed to induce NF-κB activity in
HLL mice, but BHT treatment resulted in significantly increased bioluminescence over the
chest 7 days after injection. We then asked whether NF-κB activation could substitute for
BHT treatment to promote tumor formation after exposure to MCA. WT or IKTA mice were
treated with a single IP dose of MCA plus 8 weekly IP injections of BHT or vehicle (corn
oil), with or without continuous doxycycline beginning 2 weeks prior to MCA treatment. In
contrast to WT mice, MCA alone was efficient at generating lung tumors in doxycyclinetreated IKTA mice at 16 weeks after MCA injection. The combination of doxycycline
treatment and BHT resulted in an even greater tumor burden after MCA injection in IKTA

mice (figure 4B). Histological counting of tumors on lung sections confirmed these
differences between groups and, similar to the urethane model, no differences in tumor size
or appearance were noted (data not shown). Together, these studies show that NF-κB
activation can substitute for the tumor promoting effect of BHT in this model.

Author Manuscript

We next wondered whether NF-κB activation could increase urethane-induced lung tumor
formation in the tumor-resistant C57BL/6 strain. In these studies, WT and IKTA mice (both
on C57BL/6 background) were treated with doxycycline followed by a single dose of
urethane, and doxycycline was continued until the time of harvest at 6 months. Although
lung surface tumor counts were lower in C57BL/6 mice compared to FVB mice, IKTA
C57BL/6 mice showed an approximate 2.5-fold increase in lung tumors compared to WT
C57BL/6 mice (figure 4C). Therefore, while NF-κB activation did not overcome the strainrelated differences in tumor susceptibility, the relative increase in lung surface tumors was
similar between IKTA mice on FVB or C57BL/6 backgrounds. These findings support the
idea that genetic susceptibility to tumor formation following exposure to a carcinogen can be
modified by the presence of an inflammatory lung environment.
NF-κB activation supports development of premalignant lesions in the lungs and
augments epithelial cell proliferation and survival

Author Manuscript

Since our data indicated that NF-κB activation in airway epithelial cells promotes lung
tumor formation, we investigated whether IKTA mice (FVB) developed increased numbers
of premalignant atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) lesions. We performed a timecourse study in which IKTA and WT mice (both treated with doxycycline beginning 2 weeks
prior to urethane) were harvested at 3, 6, and 9 weeks after urethane treatment. Analysis of
lung sections revealed that IKTA mice had significantly more AAH lesions than WT controls
at 6 and 9 weeks post-urethane (figures 5A,B). We identified no differences in size or
vascularity of AAH lesions between WT and IKTA mice at 6 weeks post-urethane. VEGF
levels in BAL were similar between the two groups (49±9 pg/ml in WT mice and 50±10
pg/ml in IKTA mice).

Author Manuscript

In addition, we measured cell proliferation and apoptosis in the lungs of doxycycline-treated
IKTA and WT mice after urethane treatment. By proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)
staining, we found a marked increase in proliferation of cells in the lung parenchyma
(mostly type II alveolar epithelial cells) from IKTA mice at 6 weeks after urethane injection
(figures 5C,D), correlating with the increase in AAH lesions identified in these mice.
Interestingly, by 9 weeks PCNA staining returned to near-baseline in IKTA and WT mice,
indicating that cellular proliferation increased transiently after urethane treatment. In
contrast, active caspase-3 staining of these sections obtained 9 weeks after urethane
treatment revealed reduced numbers of apoptotic cells in the lungs of IKTA mice compared
to controls (figure 5E). At 3 and 6 weeks post-urethane, very few active caspase-3 positive
cells were identified in either WT or IKTA mouse lungs. Together, these findings indicate
that chronic NF-κB-dependent inflammation creates a pro-tumorigenic environment that
supports expansion of initiated epithelial cells into premalignant AAH lesions during the
first few weeks after urethane treatment and supports persistence of these lesions by reduced
apoptosis at later time points.

Tregs enhance tumor formation in the setting of chronic airway inflammation

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

While transgene expression in IKTA mice is localized to airway epithelium (Cheng et al,
2007), we observed increased numbers of AAH lesions and increased proliferation of cells
in lung parenchyma after urethane treatment. Therefore, we reasoned that inflammatory cells
attracted by mediators produced by airway epithelia, rather than cell-autonomous effects of
increased NF-κB activation, might mediate the pro-tumorigenic phenotype of IKTA mice.
We investigated the lymphocyte influx identified in IKTA mice since these cells are
increased in the airways of patients with COPD and can influence tumor biology in a variety
of ways (Colombo and Piconese 2007; Lane et al, 2010; Lee et al, 2007; Mougiakakos et al,
2010; Plumb et al, 2009; Smyth et al, 2007; Wilke et al, 2010). We evaluated lymphocyte
subsets in the lungs of IKTA mice after doxycycline treatment. The total number of CD4+
and CD8+ lymphocytes was increased after doxycycline treatment (data not shown);
however, because of the large macrophage influx CD8+ lymphocytes were reduced as a
percentage of total CD45+ leukocytes. In contrast, the proportion of CD4+ T cells was
relatively unchanged up to 6 weeks of doxycycline treatment related to a large influx of
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs) (figure 6A,B). By 1 week after
initiation of doxycycline treatment, almost 40% of CD4+ lymphocytes were Tregs, and this
increase persisted up to 6 weeks after initiation of doxycycline treatment. By real time RTPCR, we evaluated production of NF-κB-regulated chemokines that could facilitate Treg
recruitment. As shown in figure 6C, we identified increased mRNA expression of C-C motif
chemokine ligands (CCL) 17, 20, and 22 in lung homogenates of IKTA mice after 6 weeks
of doxycycline treatment compared with doxycycline-treated WT controls.

Author Manuscript

To test whether CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs isolated from lungs of doxycycline-treated IKTA
mice possessed regulatory properties, we assessed their ability to suppress effector T cell
proliferation in an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assay (Banerjee et al,
2006). For these studies, CD4+CD25+ cells were isolated from lungs of doxycycline-treated
IKTA (FVB) mice. Approximately 93% of these cells were also positive for Foxp3 (data not
shown). Effector T cells (Teff) from spleens of naïve FVB mice were activated by
allogeneic mature dendritic cells and the suppressive effect of CD4+CD25+ T cells on
proliferation of Teff cells was evaluated by measuring carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester
(CFSE) fluorescence. CD4+CD25+ T cells from IKTA mice inhibited the proliferation of
Teff cells with the most effective suppression observed at Treg:Teff ratios ranging from 1:1
to 1:4 (figure 7A). These results demonstrate that CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells isolated from
lungs of IKTA mice have immunosuppressive properties characteristic of Tregs.

Author Manuscript

Since Tregs have been implicated in altered immune surveillance and evasion of malignant
cells from immune-mediated destruction, we depleted Tregs using a monoclonal antibody
approach to investigate the impact of Tregs on the increased tumorigenesis observed in
urethane-treated IKTA mice. We established that monoclonal anti-CD25 antibodies were
able to substantially reduce the CD4+CD25+ lymphocyte population (figure 7B). To test
contribution of Tregs in lung carcinogenesis, we treated our mice with anti-CD25 or isotype
control antibodies for 4 months. As indicated in figure 7C, Treg depletion did not influence
tumorigenesis in WT mice, but significantly blocked the increased tumor formation observed
in IKTA mice. No differences in tumor size or appearance were identified. Next we

investigated whether the influx of Tregs observed in IKTA mice promotes lung
tumorigenesis by impacting the early stages of tumor development. We treated IKTA mice
with anti-CD25 or control antibodies as described above and analyzed lungs for the
appearance of AAH lesions at 6 weeks after injection of urethane. We observed reduced
numbers of AAH lesions after depletion of CD25+ cells (figure 8A). In addition, flow
cytometry analysis of lungs from these mice confirmed a reduction in Tregs but revealed an
increased infiltration with CD8+ lymphocytes (figure 8B–D).

Author Manuscript

We wondered whether depletion of Tregs in IKTA mice could alter Th1/Th2 polarization of
lung lymphocytes. Therefore, we isolated T cells from lungs of doxycycline-treated WT
controls or IKTA mice at one week after the injection with anti-CD25 or control antibodies
and investigated production of IFNγ and IL-4 in response to stimulation with PMA/
ionomycin. Although we found no differences in the percentage of IKTA lymphocytes
producing IFNγ or IL-4 after Treg depletion, the proportion of IFNγ producing lymphocytes
was lower in IKTA lymphocytes compared to controls (figure 8E,F). We next asked whether
Tregs could enhance lung tumorigenesis through down-regulation of cytotoxic T
lymphocyte responses. To test whether CD8+ lymphocytes could have a role in suppressing
tumor formation in IKTA mice, we depleted CD8 lymphocytes using anti-CD8 antibodies.
Flow cytometry analysis of lung cells confirmed efficient depletion of these cells (figure
9A). As indicated in figure 9B, continuous depletion of CD8 lymphocytes in IKTA mice
increased the number of lung tumors at 4 month after injection of urethane. Together, these
studies suggest that Tregs recruited to the lungs could facilitate urethane-induced
tumorigenesis through suppression of cytotoxic CD8 lymphocytes.

DISCUSSION
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The NF-κB pathway is increasingly recognized as an important player in lung cancer
development and progression. Previously, we showed that inhibition of NF-κB signaling
reduces lung tumor formation induced by chemical carcinogens (Stathopoulos et al, 2007), a
finding that has been since corroborated and expanded by others in genetic models of lung
cancer resulting from oncogenic Kras expression (Basseres et al, 2010; Meylan et al, 2009;
Takahashi et al, 2010). Here, we demonstrate that chronic activation of the NF-κB pathway
amplifies tumor formation and can function as the sole tumor promoter in the presence of an
initiator (mutagen). The crucial time interval for these effects appears to be the promotion
phase of tumorigenesis, leading to increased epithelial cell proliferation and increased
premalignant AAH lesions by 6 weeks after urethane injection. A reduction in epithelial
apoptosis at later time points may also contribute to increased tumorigenesis in the setting of
chronic NF-κB-induced inflammation. We found that Tregs are recruited to the lungs in
IKTA mice and that depletion of Tregs reduced tumorigenesis in IKTA mice but not in WT
mice. This finding implicates Tregs as being important for the excessive tumor formation
resulting from chronic airway inflammation. Although the role of Tregs in COPD and other
chronic airway diseases is not well defined, increased Tregs have been reported in lungs of
COPD patients when compared to nonsmokers in several studies (Lane et al, 2010; Lee et al,
2007; Plumb et al, 2009; Smyth et al, 2007), indicating that our findings may have relevance
to the increased tumor risk associated with chronic inflammatory diseases of the lungs.

Accumulating evidence supports the idea that crosstalk between epithelial and immune cells
in the tumor microenvironment sets up a cycle of communication with pro-tumorigenic
effects. Here, we focused on the ability of epithelial NF-κB pathway activation to modify
the microenvironment in a pro-tumorigenic manner through recruitment and activation of
immune/inflammatory cells. Because of the substantial increase in Tregs observed in our
mouse model and published reports of elevated numbers of these cells in lungs of patients
with COPD (Smyth et al, 2007), we investigated the role of Tregs in exaggerated
tumorigenesis in IKTA mice. For many tumor types, there is a clear connection between
abundant accumulation of Tregs in established tumors and poor clinical outcome (Colombo
and Piconese 2007; Mougiakakos et al, 2010; Schneider et al, 2011; Wilke et al, 2010);
however, there is little known regarding the role of Tregs in tumor promotion. A prior study
showed that rapamycin treatment reduced lung tumor formation in A/J mice treated with Nnitrosamine [4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-1(3-Pyridyl)-butanone] in association with decreased
numbers of Foxp3+ cells in the lungs (Granville et al, 2009). In addition, crossing Scurfy
mice, which bear a loss-of-function mutation in the Foxp3 gene, with mice expressing
oncogenic Kras resulted in fewer lung tumors (Granville et al, 2009). We found that
functional Tregs were recruited to the lungs in an NF-κB dependent manner in IKTA mice.
To investigate the role of Tregs in lung tumorigenesis we exploited well known approach of
cell depletion using anti-CD25 mAb. These antibodies have been widely used for isolation
of Tregs as well as for elimination of Tregs in vivo. However, conflicting evidence has ben
reported regarding the nature of the inhibitory effects of anti-CD25 mAb treatment on the
Treg population. Kohm et al. showed that treatment with CD25 antibody (clone 7D4)
resulted in functional inactivation rather than depletion of Tregs (Kohm et al, 2006). Other
groups have demonstrated depletion of Tregs after injection of anti-CD25 antibodies using
clone PC61, as was used in our studies (Setiady et al, 2010; Stephens and Anderton 2006;
Zelenay and Demengeot 2006). By reducing the number of Tregs in our model, we found
that these cells contribute to the increased tumor formation in IKTA mice. Interestingly,
depletion of Tregs had no effect on tumor formation in urethane-treated WT mice,
suggesting that Tregs can enhance tumor promotion but are not necessary for urethaneinduced tumorigenesis. Therefore, recruitment of Tregs may be one important mechanism
by which chronic airway inflammation facilitates tumor development. Tregs may facilitate
cancer cell evasion from immune-mediated destruction through a variety of mechanisms,
including elaboration of an immunosuppressive cytokine profile as well as impaired
production or function of tumor-specific T cells (Curiel et al, 2004; Nummer et al, 2007).
Our findings suggested that the impact of Tregs on lung tumorigenesis in IKTA mice is
unlikely to be explained by phenotypic alterations of effector CD4 lymphocytes. Rather,
based on the increased influx of CD8 lymphocytes observed after CD25 depletion in IKTA
mice, we speculate that suppression of cytotoxic CD8 lymphocyte responses contributes to
the pro-tumorigenic effects of Tregs in our model.
While the absolute number of lung tumors induced by urethane was lower in the tumorresistant C57BL/6 background compared to the more susceptible FVB strain, NF-κB
activation resulted in proportionally similar increases in tumorigenesis in both strains of
IKTA mice compared to strain-specific controls. Thus, NF-κB-induced chronic inflammation
does not appear to completely overcome genetic resistance to lung tumorigenesis. This

observation is in accord with observations in humans; only one fifth of heavy smokers
develop lung cancer (Barnes 2008; Brody and Spira 2006). While the explanation for
individual differences in susceptibility to carcinogenic exposure is a focus of intense
research, it is likely that environmental influences, like chronic airway inflammation, can
alter underlying genetic risk (Alberg et al, 2007; Chung and Adcock 2008). Therefore,
interventions to modulate inflammatory pathways or mediators could be effective for cancer
chemoprevention regardless of genetic susceptibility.

Author Manuscript

An association between chronic inflammation and cancer has been recognized in many
human organ systems, including the lungs (Schottenfeld and Beebe-Dimmer 2006). In
addition to patients with COPD, chronic airway inflammation occurs in a large number of
current and ex-smokers without airway obstruction (Gamble et al, 2007; Lapperre et al,
2006; Willemse et al, 2005). Also, environmental exposure to air pollutants, such as diesel
exhaust particulates, has been shown to cause or exacerbate airway inflammation and induce
NF-κB activation in bronchial epithelial cells (Bonvallot et al, 2001; McCreanor et al,
2007). Therefore, the influence of NF-κB and chronic inflammation on tumorigenesis in the
lungs may be broadly important in promoting lung cancer. However, more work is needed to
determine the impact of NF-κB signaling on lung carcinogenesis in humans. The NF-κB
pathway or components of the chronic inflammatory environment in the lungs, like Tregs,
might serve as important targets for cancer chemoprevention strategies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal Models

Author Manuscript

IKTA mice (IKKβ Trans-Activated) selectively expressing a constitutively active form of
human IKKβ in airway epithelium have been reported previously (Cheng et al, 2007). We
used sex matched IKTA mice and WT littermate controls (weighing 20–25 grams) on the
original FVB background as well as transgenic mice backcrossed >9 generations into the
C57BL/6 background. To activate transgene expression, mice were provided ad lib with 0.5
mg/ml doxycycline (dox) in drinking water. To induce tumors, urethane was given by a
single IP injection (1 g/kg). In other studies, 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA) (15 μg/g) was
given by a single IP injection and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) (200 μg/g) or vehicle
(corn oil) was delivered by 8 weekly IP injections. NF-κB reporter transgenic HLL mice on
FVB background have been used for bioluminescence imaging as previously reported
(Stathopoulos et al, 2007; Yull et al, 2003). All mouse experiments were approved by the
Vanderbilt University Institutional Animal Care and Utilization Committee.
In vivo depletion of Tregs and CD8 lymphocytes

Author Manuscript

CD25+ Treg cells were depleted using modifications of previously published protocols
(Degl’Innocenti et al, 2008). For depletion 500 μg of monoclonal anti-CD25 antibody (clone
PC61; ATCC) or control IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were injected IP into WT or IKTA
mice at day -1 (prior to injection of urethane), day 6, and every 2 weeks for 16 weeks. CD8
cells were depleted with IP injection of 400 μg of 2.43 (anti-CD8) Abs on Day -1.
Thereafter, maintenance injections of 200 mg of antibody were given weekly as

described(Hashimoto et al, 2005). The efficacy of the depletion was determined by FACS
analysis of single cell suspension from lungs of doxycycline-treated IKTA mice.
BAL collection and cell counts
BAL was performed with 3 aliquots of 800 μl sterile normal saline. Fluid was combined and
centrifuged at 400× g for 10 min to separate cells from supernatant. Total and differential
cell counts were done as previously described (Stathopoulos et al, 2007).
Flow Cytometry

Author Manuscript

Lungs were digested in RPMI medium containing collagenase XI (0.7 mg/ml; SigmaAldrich) and type IV bovine pancreatic DNase (30 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). After elimination
of red blood cells using RBC Lysis Buffer (BioLegend), cells were stained with antibodies:
CD4-FITC (RM4-5), CD25-APC (PC61.5), FoxP3-PE (FJK-16s) from e-Bioscience, CD45Pacific Blue (30-F11, Invitrogen), CD3-V500 (500A2), CD8- Alexa Fluor 700 (53-6.7),
IFNγ–PE-Cy7 (XMG1.2), IL-4 - PE (11B11) from BD Bioscience. For determining
Th1/Th2 polarization, T cells were isolated from lungs of doxycycline-treated IKTA mice
using T-cell enrichment columns (R&D) and re-stimulated with PMA (1ng/ml) and
ionomycin (1uM) for 6 h in the presence of Golgi-stop (BD Biosciences) at 37°C, 5% CO2.
After staining with CD3 and CD4 antibodies, cells were permeabolized and processed for
intracellular staining using anti-IFNγ, IL-4 and FoxP3 antibodies. Cells were analyzed using
a LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed using Flow Jo 7.2
software (Tree Star).
Lung tumor enumeration

Author Manuscript

Surface tumors were counted under a dissecting microscope by two readers blinded to the
samples and averaged, as previously described (Stathopoulos et al, 2007). Tumor diameter
was determined using digital calipers (Fisher Scientific).
Histology, immunohistochemistry and analysis
Lung sections (5 μm) were stained with H&E or used for immunohistochemistry. Sections
were stained with antibodies against PCNA (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) or
active caspase-3 (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA). For proliferation analysis animals received
an IP injection of 100 μl of BrdU (20 mg/ml, ACROS Chemical Co.) 2 hours prior to
sacrifice. Lung sections were stained with rat anti-BrdU antibody (1:400; Accurate
Chemical Co.). Proliferation indices were calculated by counting the number of BrdUpositive nuclei per total nuclei in tumors.

Real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from lung tissue using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)
according to manufacturer’s specifications. DNase-treated samples were subjected to
quantitative RT-PCR using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). PCR
primers used were: CCL17 forward 5′-TGCTTCTGGGGACTTTTCTG -3′, reverse 5′CATCCCTGGAACACTCCACT -3′; CCL20 forward 5 ′TTTTGGGATGGAATTGGACAC-3′, reverse 5′-TGCAGGTGAAGCCTTCAACC-3′;

TGAGGACCAGGTTGTCTCCT – 3′, reverse 5′ – CCCTGTTGCTGTAGCCGTAT – 3′.
The relative mRNA expression in each sample was normalized to GAPDH and presented
using the comparative Ct method (2ΔCt).
Western blot analysis

Author Manuscript

Protein extracts from tissue homogenates (100 μg) were separated on a polyacrylamide gel
and transblotted for detection of FLAG-cIKKβ. Proteins were separated on a 10%
acrylamide gel and anti-FLAG antibodies (anti-FLAG conjugated with HRP M2 monoclonal
antibody, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were used (Cheng et al, 2007). Antibodies to
p42/p44 MAP Kinase (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) were used as a loading
control. Horseradish peroxidase was detected by chemoluminescence using Lumi-LightPLUS
western blotting substrate (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN).
Mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR)

Author Manuscript

An allogeneic MLR protocol was adapted from Banerjee and colleagues (Banerjee et al,
2006) using CD4+CD25- effector T cells (Teff) from spleens of naïve FVB mice (1 × 105/
well) as responders and allogeneic mature bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from
C57BL/6 mice as stimulators. Dendritic cells were obtained by culturing bone marrow cells
in DMEM (Gibco), supplemented with 10% FBS, antibiotics, 50 mM 2-ME (Gibco),
recombinant GM-CSF (20 ng/ml, Miltenyi) and IL-4 (20 ng/ml, Miltenyi) and matured by
incubation for 24 hours with LPS (1 μg/ml) added on Day 7. The ratio between the dendritic
cells and CD4+CD25- Teff cells was 1:10. To assess T cell proliferation, freshly isolated
Teff cells were labeled with CFSE (5 μM; Invitrogen). The suppressive function of
CD4+CD25+ T cells (Treg) was tested on the proliferation of CFSE-labeled Teff cells. The
ratio of Teff:Treg cells varied between 1:1 and 1:32. CD4+CD25+ Tregs from lungs of
IKTA mice treated for 1 week with 0.5 g/L of doxycycline were isolated using a Treg
isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec). The proliferation of viable CFSE-labeled Teff cells was
assessed by flow cytometry. Dead cells were excluded from analysis based on staining with
DAPI (Invitrogen).
Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, San
Diego, CA). Pair-wise comparisons were made using Welch’s t test. Comparisons among
groups were done by one-way ANOVA using Tukey’s post test. Results are presented as
mean ± standard error of the mean. P values < 0.05 were considered significant.

CD4+CD25- T cells (Teff). B) Flow cytometry assessment of lung-infiltrating T cells (from
CD45+CD3+ gate) in IKTA mice at 1 week after a single IP dose of 500 μg of anti-CD25
(PC61) or isotype control antibodies. C) Surface tumors per left lung from mice treated with
anti-CD25 antibodies (CD25) or isotype control antibodies (IgG) the day prior to urethane
treatment and on day 6, followed by repeated IP injections every 2 weeks for 4 months
(n=5–7 per group, *=p≤0.05 for IKTA mice treated with anti-CD25 Ab compared to IKTA
mice treated with isotype control Ab).

Figure 8. Depletion of Tregs in IKTA mice increases infiltration of lungs with CD8 lymphocytes
and reduces the number of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) lesions

Author Manuscript

A) Photomicrographs of lung sections demonstrating AAH lesions at 6 weeks post-urethane
in IKTA mice treated with anti-CD25 antibodies (CD25) or isotype control antibodies (IgG)
per protocol (original magnification x200). B–D) Percentages of total CD4+ T cells, CD8+
T cells, and CD4+ Foxp3+ Tregs identified by flow cytometry in lungs from anti-CD25 or
isotype control antibody-treated IKTA mice at 6 weeks after injection of urethane (1 week
after last antibody dose) (n=4 per group, *=p<0.05). E,F) Percentages of CD4+Foxp3-IL-4+
and CD4+Foxp3-IFNγ+ lymphocytes isolated from lungs of doxycycline-treated IKTA mice
at 1 week after a single IP dose of 500 μg of anti-CD25 (PC61) or isotype control antibodies.
Cells were re-stimulated with PMA/ionomycin for 6 hours in vitro and analyzed by flow
cytometry.
