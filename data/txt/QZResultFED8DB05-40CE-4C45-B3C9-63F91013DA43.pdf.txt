ABSTRACT
T–lymphokine-activated killer cell–originated protein kinase (TOPK) and
maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) have been reported to play critical
roles in cancer cell proliferation and maintenance of stemness. In this study, we
investigated possible roles of TOPK and MELK in kidney cancer cells and found their
growth promotive effect as well as some feedback mechanism between these two
molecules. Interestingly, the blockade of either of these two kinases effectively
caused downregulation of forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1) activity which is
known as an oncogenic transcriptional factor in various types of cancer cells.
Small molecular compound inhibitors against TOPK (OTS514) and MELK (OTS167)
effectively suppressed the kidney cancer cell growth, and the combination of these
two compounds additively worked and showed the very strong growth suppressive
effect on kidney cancer cells. Collectively, our results suggest that both TOPK and
MELK are promising molecular targets for kidney cancer treatment and that dual
blockade of OTS514 and OTS167 may bring additive anti-tumor effects with low risk
of side effects.

INTRODUCTION

interstitial pneumonia [6-10]. Therefore, development
of more effective therapy for kidney cancer is eagerly
expected.
TOPK (T-lymphokine-activated killer celloriginated protein kinase, also known as PBK or PDZbinding kinase) is a Ser/Thr protein kinase that is highly
expressed in various types of human cancer [11-14].
TOPK is known to be activated during the cell mitosis
process and play a critical role in cytokinesis. We
previously reported that knockdown of TOPK caused
dysfunction of cytokinesis and subsequently apoptosis of
cancer cells [13].
MELK (maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase,
also known as MPK38 or murine protein serine/threonine
kinase 38) is a cell-cycle dependent protein kinase that
belongs to the AMP-activated Ser/Thr protein kinase
family [15, 16]. Elevated expression of the MELK gene
is correlated with poorly differentiated histological types
of brain tumor and prostate cancer [17, 18], and with poor

Kidney cancer is the seventh most common cancer
and the tenth most common cause of cancer death in men,
and it is also the tenth most common cause of cancer in
women [1]. In 2015, the number of new kidney and renal
pelvis cancer cases was estimated to be 61,560 that led to
more than 14,080 deaths in United States [1]. The 5-year
disease-specific survival has improved from about 50% in
1975-1977 to 65% in 2000-2005, although that of patients
at an advanced stage still remains poorly with around
10% rate [2-4]. 30% of patients who underwent surgery
of localized kidney cancer develop distant metastasis and
have limited therapeutic options, such as tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) and mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) inhibitors [5]. In addition, the clinical effects of
these drugs are very limited and patients often discontinue
administration of these drugs due to severe side effects
including hand-foot syndrome, liver dysfunction and

prognosis of breast cancer patients [19].
The two molecules, TOPK and MELK, have
shown similar expression patterns; they are up-regulated
in various types of cancer including cancer stem cellenriched tumors and more importantly their expressions
are hardly detectable in normal organs except in the
testis [11, 20]. Moreover, MELK expression levels were
strongly correlated with those of forkhead box protein
M1 (FOXM1) known as an important transcriptional
factor and a master regulator of mitosis in cancer stem
cells [21, 22]. These results suggest a possible close link
among TOPK, MELK, and FOXM1 in a growth regulation
pathway in cancer cells, which may provide a new strategy
for successful treatment of cancer patients. Hence, we
have developed TOPK inhibitors (OTS514 and OTS964)
and a MELK inhibitor (OTS167) that showed therapeutic
potentials in pre-clinical models of human cancer [23, 24].
In the present study, we demonstrate that TOPK
regulates FOXM1 like as MELK does and that knockdown
of either TOPK or MELK effectively suppresses the
growth signaling pathway composed of these three
oncoproteins. We also demonstrated that the combination
of OTS514 and OTS167 can effectively reduce the
expression levels of TOPK, MELK and FOXM1, and
decreased viability of kidney cancer cells. These findings
suggest that dual blockade using a combination of a TOPK
inhibitor (OTS514) and a MELK inhibitor (OTS167) at
the lower dose may be a promising molecular-targeted
therapy for kidney cancer patients with avoidance or
reduction of their toxicity.

To investigate the biological function of TOPK and
MELK in kidney cancer cells, we used siRNA (small
interfering RNA) to knockdown TOPK and MELK
expression using three kidney cancer cell lines, VMRCRCW, Caki-1, and Caki-2 in which TOPK and MELK
were highly co-expressed (Figure 1A). Each of siRNA
successfully knocked down the transcript levels of the
target genes (Figure 1B) and also significantly reduced
the amount of its target protein (Figure 1C). However,
unexpectedly, knockdown of TOPK led to reduction
of MELK protein level and vice versa knockdown of
MELK reduced TOPK protein level (Figure 1C). The
semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the expression of
MELK was also downregulated by TOPK knockdown and
vice versa knockdown of MELK downregulated TOPK
transcription level (Figure 1B), suggesting that TOPK and
MELK are likely to be influenced each other.

TOPK and MELK knockdown downregulates
FOXM1 activity
The transcriptional interaction between TOPK and
MELK allowed us to examine any possible transcriptional
factor that can influence on expression of these two
genes. In the TCGA database, we found that TOPK and
MELK expression levels were strongly correlated with
that of FOXM1 (Pearson’s rank correlation is 0.73 and
0.82, respectively, Supplementary Figure S3, 4) [26,
27]. Moreover, we previously reported that the MELK
inhibitor reduced expression of FOXM1 at protein level
[22]. FOXM1 is a key transcriptional factor involved
in the proliferation of cancer cells including leukemia
cells that were very sensitive to both TOPK and MELK
inhibitors [22, 28]. It is also notable that TOPK, MELK,
and FOXM1 were suggested as cancer stem cell markers
and listed in top 30 of the “consensus stemness ranking
(CSR) signature” genes [29]. Based on these findings, we
examined whether knockdown of TOPK or MELK could
influence on the expression of FOXM1. As expected,
FOXM1 protein level was decreased in kidney cancer
cells transfected with siMELK (Figure 2A), probably
due to the decrease of FOXM1 transcription (Figure 2B).
Intriguingly, siTOPK also resulted in the downregulation
of FOXM1 not only in protein level but also in
transcriptional level (Figure 2A and 2B).

RESULTS
TOPK and MELK expression in kidney cancer
cell lines
We examined expression levels of TOPK and MELK
genes in kidney cancers through publically-available gene
expression datasets. The Oncomine database revealed
that both TOPK and MELK genes are significantly upregulated in kidney cancers (Supplementary Figure S1).
Interestingly, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data
showed that expression levels of TOPK and MELK are
strongly correlated in various cancer types as shown in
Supplementary Figure S2, suggesting that TOPK and
MELK may be regulated by a common transcription
pathway or may be in some positive feedback loop [2527]. Based on these findings, we investigated expression
levels of TOPK and MELK in 16 kidney cancer cell lines
by western blot analysis (Figure 1A). Although some
cell lines showed the discordance in TOPK and MELK
protein levels, most of the cell lines examined revealed
the concordant expression levels, further suggesting some
interaction between TOPK and MELK.

Growth suppressive effect of OTS514 and OTS167
in kidney cancer cells

immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay [30], we investigated
transcriptional regulation on the TOPK and MELK genes
by FOXM1. We first transfected kidney cancer cells
with siFOXM1 and found that both TOPK and MELK
mRNA levels were decreased in three kidney cancer cell
lines compared with the cells treated with control siRNA
(Figure 3A). We then exogenously introduced FOXM1
expression vector into two kidney cancer cell lines and
found the significant elevation of TOPK and MELK
mRNA expression in the cells transfected with FOXM1
expression vectors, while no change was observed in those
transfected with the mock control vector (Figure 3B).
Taken together, these results suggest that FOXM1 may
function as a transcriptional factor that induces expression
of TOPK and MELK genes in kidney cancer cells.
Since either TOPK or MELK suppression with siRNA
downregulated FOXM1, the feedback system among these
three genes seems to be very complicated.

Since both TOPK and MELK were overexpressed in
kidney cancer [26, 27], we examined the half-maximum
inhibitory concentration (IC50) value to measure the
growth inhibitory effect of OTS514 and OTS167 on five
kidney cancer cell lines, VMRC-RCW, Caki-1, Caki-2,
769-P and 786-O, in which TOPK and MELK were highly
co-expressed (Figure 4A-4E). Our assay revealed low IC50
values as 19.9 to 44.1 nM for TOPK inhibitor OTS514 and
12.4 to 38.7 nM for MELK inhibitor OTS167.

Downregulation of TOPK, MELK and FOXM1
by OTS514 and OTS167
Our previous study in leukemic cells showed that
downregulation of MELK resulted in the suppression of

Dual TOPK and MELK inhibition additively
reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis

FOXM1 [22]. Similarly, our results in kidney cancer cells
treated with the IC50 concentration of MELK inhibitor
(OTS167) showed decrease of MELK and TOPK proteins
as well as FOXM1 protein (Figure 5). This downregulation
effect of three proteins by OTS167 was in concordant with
that of siMELK treatment (Figure. 2A). Interestingly,
treatment with TOPK inhibitor (OTS514) at the IC50
condition also remarkably reduced the protein level of all
three proteins (Figure 5), similar to the results obtained by
siTOPK treatment (Figure 2A). Collectively, our assays
implied that both inhibitors are very effective to suppress
kidney cancer cell growth through reduction of TOPK,
MELK, and FOXM1 proteins that may cooperatively
constitute a critical signal pathway in kidney cancer cells.

Although a detailed molecular mechanism in
regulation of TOPK, MELK, and FOXM1 needs to be
clarified, our findings from siRNA experiments and
assays using small molecule inhibitors strongly indicated
some kind of feedback loop machinery among the
three molecules. Taking into consideration of clinical
application, we evaluated a combinatory inhibitory effect
against TOPK and MELK. We transfected the low amount
of siRNA (50 pmol each) that is equivalent to one-fourth
of siRNA that we used knockdown assays shown in Figure
1. Although this amount of siRNA was capable to reduce
TOPK and MELK expression modestly, combination of
siTOPK and siMELK at this concentration resulted in
much stronger effect on reduction of TOPK and MELK
expression as well as FOXM1 expression (Figure 6A).

expressed.

or are at stage IV have limited therapeutic options such
as kinase inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors, which often
cause severe adverse effects [5, 6]. Given the limitation
of these therapeutic choices, novel effective anti-cancer
drugs should be developed urgently.
According to the Oncomine database, TOPK and
MELK are upregulated in kidney cancer and considered
as promising molecular targets because of their cancerrestricted expression patterns [26, 27]. Previous studies
have shown that MELK inhibition effectively reduced
expression of an oncogenic transcriptional factor, FOXM1
[22]. In the present study, we further demonstrated that
TOPK knockdown also caused suppression of FOXM1
expression as similar to MELK knockdown. We also
revealed that the growth of kidney cancer was suppressed
by either TOPK or MELK inhibition.
The transcriptional interaction among TOPK,
MELK and FOXM1 seems to be very complicated. We
have demonstrated that treatment of cancer cells with
either siTOPK or siMELK downregulated FOXM1 both
in protein level and in transcriptional level. These results
implied the presence of some feedback mechanism that
regulates expression of the FOXM1 gene. To elucidate
this complex feedback system, we conducted large-scale
gene network analysis by the SiGN-BN algorithm using
a supercomputer system. However, we could not find any
possible candidate factors involved in the MELK-TOPKFOXM1 pathway in any deposited cancer database. This
may be partially explained by (1) lack of relevant kidney
cancer dataset in the database, (2) indirect regulation of
these three genes in the feedback loop including multiple

Concordantly, combination of siTOPK and siMELK
effectively achieved decrease of cell viability of kidney
cancer cells (Figure 6B). Subsequently, three kidney
cancer cell lines were treated with IC50 values of OTS514
or/and OTS167. As expected, MTT assay revealed that
the combination treatment of OTS514 and OTS167
significantly decreased cell viability for all of the kidney
cancer cells examined, compared with the treatment with
a single compound (Figure 7A). In addition, we assessed
apoptosis of cancer cells (Caki-2) by flow cytometry and
observed significantly increased apoptosis of 14.7 ± 2.6
% (p = 0.001, for OTS514) or 10.6 ± 2.6 % (p = 0.001,
for OTS167) at an early time-point of drug treatment
(Annexin-positive but PI-negative field) when cells were
treated with the two drugs (Figure 7B). Consistent with
these findings, the cleaved caspase 3 was significantly
increased in the cells with the combination of OTS514 and
OTS167 (p = 0.03 and p = 0.02, respectively, Figure 7C).
Effective induction of apoptosis by combination of two
compounds was also observed in kidney cancer VMRCRCW cells (Supplementary Figure S5).

DISCUSSION
Despite advances in the novel treatment modalities,
5-year cancer specific survival rate of kidney cancer
patients who are at the advanced stage still remains around
10% [1, 2, 4]. This low rate may be partially explained by
the poor response of kidney cancer to chemotherapy and
radiation therapy. Moreover, patients who once relapsed

mechanism should be elucidated, our findings suggested
the existence of a complex feedback loop among

FOXM1 (data not shown), it is almost certain that TOPK
and MELK are more attractive molecular targets than
FOXM1 to inhibit signaling pathways essential for cancer
proliferation, although it remains unclear which will serve
as an upstream of others and play more fundamental roles
in kidney cancer.
Pre-clinical studies showed that treatment with
TOPK inhibitor (OTS964, a derivative of OTS514) could
induce complete regression of tumors but led to adverse
reactions in hematopoietic cells [23]. On the other hand,
MELK inhibitor (OTS167) did not cause any adverse
reactions at the effective dose although it did not result
in complete regression of tumors in mice model [24].
In fact, we demonstrated that dual blockade with low
doses of TOPK inhibitor (OTS514) and MELK inhibitor
(OTS167) achieved the additive cancer cell killing effects
rather compared with the single treatment. Considering
advantages and disadvantages of these compounds, it will
be essential to figure out the most effective combination
dose to achieve complete tumor elimination with minimum
risk of adverse reaction.
In summary, we suggest that both TOPK and
MELK are attractive molecular targets for kidney cancer
treatment and they constitute a feedback loop with an
oncogenic transcriptional factor FOXM1. Given that
the beneficial effects of dual administration of low dose
OTS514 and OTS167, this combination strategy will
provide more potential cancer therapeutics that could be
applied to a various types of human malignancy.

(Millipore, Billerica, MA). The proteins were separated by
electrophoresis using 4-20% or 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel, and
transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes
were incubated with the first antibody, respectively: antiTOPK antibody (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), antiFOXM1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA), anti-HA (Roche), or anti-β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich).
Finally, the membrane was incubated with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and protein
bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence
detection reagents (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA). We
generated mouse anti-MELK monoclonal antibodies using
partial recombinant MELK protein (264-601 amino acids
of MELK) as an immunogen by the methods as described
previously [31].
