BACKGROUND: It has been reported that antidiabetic drugs affect the risk of cancer and the prognosis of patients
with diabetes, but few studies have demonstrated the influence of different antidiabetic agents on outcomes after
anticancer therapy among patients with cancer. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of the antidiabetic drugs metformin and insulin on the prognosis of patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
plus type 2 diabetes who received first-line chemotherapy. METHODS: Data on patients with NSCLC who had diabetes from 5 hospitals in China during January 2004 to March 2009 were reviewed retrospectively. Ninety-nine patients
were included in the final analysis. The influence of metformin and insulin on chemotherapy response rates and survival in these patients was evaluated. RESULTS: Chemotherapy with metformin (Group A) produced superior results
compared with insulin (Group B) and compared with drugs other than metformin and insulin (Group C) in terms of
both progression-free survival (PFS) (8.4 months vs 4.7 months vs 6.4 months, respectively; P ¼ .002) and overall
survival (OS) (20.0 months vs 13.1 months vs 13.0 months, respectively; P ¼ .007). Although no significant differences
in the response rate (RR) were observed between these 3 groups, when groups B and C (ie, the nonmetformin
group) were combined, there was a tendency for better disease control in Group A than that in nonmetformin group.
No significant difference in survival was observed between chemotherapy with insulin (Group B) versus other drugs
(Group C). CONCLUSIONS: The current data suggested that metformin may improve chemotherapy outcomes and

Both cancer and diabetes are common diseases that are prevalent around the world. Recently, accumulating data have
indicated that patients with diabetes have a higher incidence of some types of cancer, such as malignancies of the endometrium, breast, colorectum, liver, pancreas, etc.1-9 Antidiabetic drugs also reportedly have different effects on cancer risk and
prognosis.10-15 For example, metformin, a biguanide derivative for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, has been associated with
a reduced risk of cancer risk and mortality in diabetic patients; and insulin or insulin secretagogue use was associated with an
increased risk of certain cancers, such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, bladder cancer, etc.10-11,14-16
Although epidemiologic studies have indicated that metformin lowers the risk of several types of cancer in diabetic
patients,9-11,13,14,17 the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Nonetheless, further evidence suggests that metformin
can enhance the effects of chemotherapy in established tumors (eg, breast cancer). In a retrospective study of patients with
breast cancer who had diabetes and received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, those who received metformin had a higher pathologic complete response rate.18 Basic and experimental research also has hinted at a potential role for metformin in cancer

therapy.19-21 Conversely, hyperinsulinemia combined
with insulin resistance has been associated with increased
cancer risk and mortality.10-11,16 Insulin and insulin-like
growth factor (IGF) have been reported as growth-promoting hormones with mitogenic effects, and blocking
their signaling may inhibit tumor cell proliferation.22-24
However, few studies have demonstrated the influence of
different antidiabetic agents on anticancer therapeutics,
such as chemotherapy.
Lung cancer is 1 of the leading causes of cancer death
worldwide. Data indicating that antidiabetic drugs influence the efficacy of chemotherapy for patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain absent. In the
current study, we retrospectively investigated the effects of
metformin and insulin on the prognosis for patients with
NSCLC who also had type 2 diabetes and received firstline chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
Data on >4000 patients with NSCLC who attended 5
hospitals in Sichuan Province in West China during January 2004 to March 2009 were searched. The 5 hospitals
were 1) West China Hospital of Sichuan University,
2) Sichuan Cancer Hospital, 3) Mianyang Central Hospital, 4) General Hospital of the People’s Liberation Army
Chengdu Military Region, and 5) Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital. Inclusion criteria were histologic or cytologic confirmation of NSCLC, pre-existing diabetes before
the beginning of first-line chemotherapy for NSCLC, at
least 2 cycles of first-line chemotherapy completed, at least
1 target lesion according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), and evaluable radiographic
images before and after chemotherapy. Patients were
excluded for the following reasons: brain metastasis; irradiated target lesions; the completion of previous adjuvant
chemotherapy, if given, <12 months before the development of recurrence and/or metastasis; and the patient
received both metformin and insulin during first-line
chemotherapy and before disease progression.
Data Collection
For all patients, data on age, sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), tumorlymph node-metastasis (TNM) classification, tumor
response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival
(OS), the regimens and cycles of chemotherapy, diabetes
duration, renal function, serum glucose level, and body

mass index were collected (Table 1). TNM classification
according to the International Union Against Cancer was
used for disease staging and was determined from computed tomography (CT) scans or/and nuclear magnetic
resonance images (MRIs), whole-body bone scans, and
bronchoscopy. Tumor responses were assessed using
RECIST criteria. CT scans or MRI studies of measurable
lesions were assessed at baseline and after 2 cycles during
chemotherapy. The response rate (RR) was defined as the
proportion of patients who achieved a reduction 30%
in the greatest tumor dimension (a partial response [PR])
or who achieved the complete disappearance of tumor
(complete response [CR]) for at least 4 weeks. The disease
control rate (DCR) was defined as the proportion of
patients whose tumor did not progress on treatment.
Most patients were followed at an interval of approximately 2 to 3 months after chemotherapy had been finished or stopped.
Statistical Analysis
PFS was calculated from the date chemotherapy began to
the date of either disease progression or death, whichever
occurred first. Survival was calculated from the date chemotherapy began to the date of death. In the absence of disease progression or death, data were ‘‘censored’’ at the
date of last follow-up. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were
fitted for PFS and OS and were used to estimate the median and 1-year values. The log-rank test was used to compare the Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS and OS. Tumor
response was compared using the standard chi-square test.
The SPSS statistical software package (version 12.0; SPSS
Inc., Chicago, Ill) was used for statistical analyses, and statistical significance was set at P < .05.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
One hundred forty-three patients with NSCLC who had
type 2 diabetes and received first-line chemotherapy met
the inclusion criteria. Of those patients, 44 were excluded
for brain metastasis (n ¼ 10), radiated target lesions (n ¼
6), receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy <12 months before
recurrence and/or metastasis (n ¼ 21), and receipt of both
metformin and insulin during observation (n ¼ 7). The
final study population consisted of 99 patients (Fig. 1). The
patients were divided into 3 groups according to the treatment received. Group A comprised the patients who
received metformin treatment (n ¼ 39), Group B comprised
the patients who received insulin treatment (n ¼ 35), and

cancer, and 1 patient had died of an unknown cause. Four
patients were lost to PFS follow-up (3 patients in Group A
and 1 patient in Group B), and the previous evaluation of
tumor response for those 4 patients were 2 PRs, 1 patient
with stable disease (SD) in Group A, and 1 patient with SD
in Group B. Twenty-four patients were lost to OS followup (9 patients in Group A, 10 patients in Group B, and 5
patients in Group C). Thus, 99 patients obtained RR, 95
patients obtained PFS, and 63 patients obtained OS.
Response Rates
Patients in both Group A and Group C received a median
of 4 cycles (range, 2-6 cycles) of chemotherapy, and
patients in Group B received a median of 3 cycles (range,
2-7 cycles) of chemotherapy. The tumor responses in the
3 groups are reported in Table 2. The RR for Group A
was 38.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23.2%53.8%), the RR for Group B was 20% (95% CI, 7%33.2%), and the RR for Group C was 36% (95% CI,
17.2%-54.8%; P ¼ .195). One CR was observed in
Group A, no CRs were observed in Group B, and 1 CR

When we combined Groups B and C as a nonmetformin
group, the metformin group displayed a tendency toward
better DCR compared with the nonmetformin group
(P ¼ .068) (Table 3). Otherwise, when we combined
Groups A and C as a noninsulin group, the insulin group
tended to have a worse tumor response compared with the
noninsulin group (P ¼ .073) (Table 3).
Progression-Free Survival
The median PFS for all patients was 6.4 months (range,
1.2-54.4 months; 95% CI, 5.5-7.5 months). The median
PFS for Groups A, B, and C was 8.4 months (range, 1.354.4 months; 95% CI, 6.3-10.5 months), 4.7 months
(range, 1.2-19.1 months; 95% CI, 3.4-6.0 months), and
6.4 months (range, 1.3-13.3 months; 95% CI, 5.8-7.0

DISCUSSION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths
in the United States,25 and the proportions of patients
with lung cancer in developing nations have increased in
the last 2 decades.26 Previous data indicated that >8% of
lung cancer patients had diabetes at the time of cancer diagnosis,1,27 and these patients had a worse prognosis compared with patients who did not have diabetes.1,27,28 The

poor prognosis for cancer patients with diabetes was
ascribed to all-cause mortality1 or cancer-related mortality28 compared with patients who did not have diabetes.
In any case, diabetes does influence the prognosis for cancer patients. Whether different antidiabetic agents affect
the efficacy of cancer therapy or the prognosis for patients
with NSCLC remains unclear. In our current analysis of
patients with NSCLC who had diabetes, first-line chemotherapy with metformin produced a better outcome in
terms of PFS, OS, and probably DCR compared with the
outcomes produced with insulin or other drugs. Otherwise, no significant difference in tumor response or survival was observed between the insulin group and the
other use group, but a tendency toward a worse RR was
observed in the insulin group compared with the

noninsulin group. To our knowledge, this is the first study
to demonstrate a benefit from metformin as chemotherapy for patients with NSCLC.
The relation between diabetes and cancer risk has
been well documented.12,13 The increased cancer risk in
diabetes has been explained by obesity, insulin resistance,
and/or increased levels of IGF-I and insulin2,12; and
hyperglycemia also may play a role in enhancing tumor
growth or resistance to antitumor therapy.2,3 Of these factors, IGF-I and insulin have been reported as mitogenic
and tumor growth factors both in vivo and in vitro,2,29,30
offering a more plausible mechanistic explanation for the
higher risk of cancers in diabetic populations2; and the tumor-promoting effects of diabetes also reportedly recently
were reversed by blockade of insulin receptor/IGF-I receptor (IR/IGF-IR) signaling in a mouse breast cancer
model.15 The receptors for IGF-I and insulin also reportedly were overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells associated with diabetes. These findings suggested that use of
insulin may influence the risk and prognosis of some cancers.2 In our analysis, insulin use did not have an adverse
effect on chemotherapy outcomes in terms of either PFS
or OS among patients with NSCLC compared with
patients who used other drugs, although insulin use
tended to produce a worse RR than noninsulin use. However, those data were from a retrospective, nonrandomized
study, the sample size was small for both the insulin group
and other use group, and some of the patients (15 of 25)
in the other use group received sulfonylureas, which are
insulin secretagogues agents and may have confused the
results. Further studies should be conducted to clarify the
role of insulin in cancer chemotherapy.
Metformin is another widely used antidiabetic drug
with advantages of a lack of weight gain, a low risk of
hypoglycemia, and a mode of action that counters insulin
resistance.31 Recent studies suggest that taking metformin
may be associated with a reduced risk of cancer in patients
with type 2 diabetes.10,11,13,14,17 Possible explanations
for these action were that metformin was involved in activating the serine/threonine kinase 11-50 adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (LKB1-AMPK)
pathway,32-36 reducing insulin resistance or decreasing
circulating insulin levels.11,37 Basic and animal experiments also suggested that a metformin-mediated reduction in insulin resistance was associated with a reduction
in the risk of tumor development.11,32,38-40 In addition,
metformin reportedly blocked the mitogenic effects of
insulin and IGF-I by blocking the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase/Akt/mammilian target of rapamycin (mTOR)

5108

signaling pathway and by inhibiting cell division, and a
direct antineoplastic effect of metformin also was
reported.10,41,42
Although basic research and prevalence data indicated an association between metformin and a low risk of
cancer in diabetes or its potential anticancer activities, few
studies have investigated the role of metformin in clinical
anticancer treatment. Recently, Jiralerspong et al reported
results indicating that metformin use was associated with
a higher pathologic CR rate in diabetic patients with
breast cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.18
Their results are exciting and may promote perspective
clinical trials to examine the anticancer activity of metformin in breast cancer. To our knowledge, the influence of
metformin on chemotherapy for NSCLC still is unclear.
Our study is the first to associate better survival with the
receipt of metformin during first-line chemotherapy in
patients with NSCLC compared with either insulin use or
the use of other agents. Although no significant differences in RR and DCR were observed among our 3 groups,
when we combined the insulin and other use groups into
a nonmetformin group, there was a tendency of statistically significant difference in the DCR between the metformin group and the nonmetformin group. Thus, we
believe it is possible that insufficient patient numbers may
be responsible for this result and that long-term metformin use may result in a survival benefit. We suspected
that there was potential for the antitumor activities of metformin to improve chemotherapy and survival outcomes
in patients with NSCLC. Previous studies indicated that
higher plasma levels of IGF-I were present in patients
compared with the levels in a control group,43 and metformin alone or combined with chemotherapy also reportedly blocked tumor growth in tumor cell experiments and
animal models.21,41,42,44 All of this evidence helps explain
the phenomenon that metformin improved disease control and prolonged survival in patients with NSCLC who
had diabetes and received chemotherapy.
We know that approximately 20% to 30% of
patients with type 2 diabetes may develop diabetic nephropathy, and the development of diabetic nephropathy
has a chronic process that may be latent for up to 10 to 15
years after the onset of diabetes.45 In our cohort, the median duration of diabetes in the metformin, insulin, and
other use groups were 36 months, 37 months, and 21
months, respectively, which indicates that the diabetic duration for most patients in the cohort was relatively short.
No obvious abnormalities in levels of urea nitrogen, creatinine, or uric acid were observed; and no significant

differences were observed in renal function among the 3
groups. In this study, only patients who had received at
least 2 cycles of chemotherapy were included, and those
with renal injury were not included in the cohort, possibly
because they received no chemotherapy or less chemotherapy that could be ascribed to their inadequate renal function. We also followed changes in renal function after
chemotherapy, although approximately 85% of patients in
the cohort had received a platinum-containing regimen,
and no significant differences were observed between the
first and last cycles of chemotherapy in each group. Carboplatin-containing regimens accounted for nearly 60% of
the platinum-containing chemotherapy received in the
cohort, which may be responsible for these results. Because
fewer patients (approximately 40%) received cisplatin-containing regimens, the influence of cisplatin on renal function in diabetic patients remains uncertain.
During the course of diabetes, oral antidiabetic
drugs (such as metformin) usually are used as front-line
treatment, and insulin often is required in patients with
more severe diabetics. Thus, the use of insulin may represent a more severe status of diabetes and may have affected
outcomes in our 3 groups. In this study, the durations of
diabetes in the metformin group and the insulin group
were comparable (36 months and 37 months, respectively) and were relatively short. Organ functions, such as
renal function, also were similar among the 3 groups. Furthermore, considering the chronic nature of diabetes, the
life expectancy for patients with diabetes is much longer
than that for patients with advanced NSCLC. For example, the estimated age-specific life expectancy of men aged
65 years with type 2 diabetes varies between 8.0 years and
14.9 years for patients in the highest to lowest risk groups
for different combinations of risk factors.46 In terms of
duration of diabetes, life expectancy for men aged 65 years
in the highest to lowest risk groups varies between 8.9
years and 16.5 years at 3 years postdiagnosis.46 Otherwise,
large, randomized phase 3 trials in metastatic NSCLC
have demonstrated that platinum-based chemotherapy
combinations yield a median survival of approximately 8
to 11 months.47,48 Thus, we believe that a diabetic duration of 3 years may have had little influence on the survival
of our cohort of patients with NSCLC. More importantly, the ECOG PS, which has important influence on
the prognosis of patients with cancer, also was similar
among the 3 groups. Nevertheless, large-scale, well
designed, prospective clinical investigations will be necessary to assess the influence of diabetes duration on cancer
patients.

The data presented in this study were from a retrospective analysis and included a small sample cohort,
which limited the level of evidence. Of the patients who
were included in the study, 96% achieved PFS for the
analysis, and 63.6% achieved OS for the analysis, and
patients who were lost to follow-up may have affected the
actual results. In our analysis, because there were only 4
censored values on PFS, the probability of a distorted PFS
outcome was minimal. For OS, 24 patients were lost follow-up, and 12 patients who remained alive were censored in this retrospective study, and these may have
affected the actual OS outcome. Previous studies have
indicated that PFS has a highly positive correlation with
OS and is used increasingly as an endpoint for cancer clinical trials, and the US Food and Drug Administration also
is demonstrating flexibility in moving toward PFS as an
endpoint.49-53 Thus, we believe that our current results
are valuable with regard to treatment choices for patients
with NSCLC who have diabetes. Prospective, controlled,
and randomized studies are expected to produce further
information.
In conclusion, our current results suggest that metformin improves chemotherapy outcomes and survival in
patients with NSCLC who have diabetes, and metformin
may be an optimal choice for patients who have both
NSCLC and diabetes. Further studies examining the antitumor activities of metformin would be worthwhile.
