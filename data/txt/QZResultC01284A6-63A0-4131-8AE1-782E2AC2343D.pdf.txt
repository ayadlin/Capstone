ABSTRACT:
TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis through
death receptors (DRs) 4 and/or 5 expressed on the surface of target cells. We have
previously shown that deficiency of DR4 and DR5 on the surface membrane is a
critical mechanism of cancer cell resistance to the recombinant human TRAIL and its
receptor agonistic antibodies, which are being evaluated clinically for treating cancers.
In certain cancer cells, DR4 and DR5 were found to be mislocalized in intracellular
compartments yet to be characterized. Here, we report a novel role of autophagy in
the regulation of dynamics of TRAIL death receptors. We first assessed basal levels
of autophagosomes in a panel of 11 breast cancer cell lines using complementary
approaches (LC3 immunoblotting, RFP-LC3 fluorescence microscopy, and electron
microscopy). We found high levels of basal autophagosomes in TRAIL resistant
breast cancer cell lines (e.g. BT474 and AU565) and relevant mouse xenograft models
under nutrition-rich conditions. Notably, DR4 and DR5 co-localized with LC3-II in
the autophagosomes of TRAIL-resistant cells. Disruption of basal autophagosomes
successfully restored the surface expression of the death receptors which was
accompanied by sensitization of TRAIL-resistant cells to TRAIL induced apoptosis. By
contrast, TRAIL-sensitive cell lines (MDA-MB-231) are characterized by high levels of
surface DR4/DR5 and an absence of basal autophagosomes. Inhibition of lysosomal
activity induced an accumulation of autophagosomes and a decrease in surface DR4
and DR5, and the cells became less sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These
findings demonstrate a novel role for the basal autophagosomes in the regulation of
TRAIL death receptors. Further studies are warranted to explore the possibility of
using autophagosome markers such as LC3-II/LC3-I ratios for prediction of tumor
resistance to TRAIL related therapies. The results also provide a rationale for future
non-clinical and clinical studies testing TRAIL agonists in combination with agents
that directly inhibit autophagosome assembly.

cells without causing damage to most normal cells [1-3].

trials to evaluate the antitumor potential of recombinant
human TRAIL (rhTRAIL) and its receptor-specific
agonistic antibodies [4-6]. These therapies act through
death receptor (DRs) 4 and/or 5 expressed on the surface
of target cells, thereby inducing the assembly of the death
inducing signaling complex (DISC) and activation of a
caspase cascade. Compared to recombinant human TNFα
(rhTNF), which produced severe toxicity after systemic
administration [7, 8], TRAIL receptor targeted therapies
have demonstrated an improved safety profile in Phase I
clinical trials [4-6, 9]. However, some tumor cells (e.g.
breast cancer) are resistant to TRAIL agonists [10-13].
It is believed that combinational chemotherapies are
required to achieve a better clinical efficacy for TRAIL
receptor-targeted therapies [14, 15]. Indeed, ongoing phase
2 clinical trials are focused on evaluation of rhTRAIL and
DR4 or DR5 monoclonal antibodies in combination with
various chemotherapies or targeted therapies [16]. Further
concerns arise from the observations that TRAIL treatment
even caused an increased growth [17-19] and metastasis
[20] of tumor cells that were already resistant to TRAIL
induced death. Therefore, it is critical to fully understand
the mechanisms underlying TRAIL resistance and to
apply the information into the design and selection of
combinational drugs to overcome cancer drug resistance
towards a better clinical outcome of cancer treatment.
TRAIL resistance can be intrinsic in some tumor
cells or acquired in cells that were originally responsive
to TRAIL. One of the mechanisms involves tumor
characteristics that generally inhibit apoptosis execution
such as reduced caspase expression [21, 22], increased
expression of caspase inhibitors such as c-FLIP, XIAP,
cIAP2 and Bcl-2 [4], and a rapid degradation of truncated
Bid (tBid) [23]. Other mechanisms of TRAIL resistance
directly related to the defects in the TRAIL receptors
themselves, including epigenetic silencing of DR4 [24],
dominant-negative mutations in DR4 or DR5 [25], O- and
N-linked glycosylation status [26, 27], and co-existence
of decoy receptors [28]. Our studies demonstrate that
DR4 and DR5 are absent on the cell surface of certain
cancer cells despite their total protein expressions
[29]. While DR4/DR5 subcellular localizations remain
to be characterized, lack of their surface expression
appears to be sufficient to render cellular resistance to
the corresponding ligands [13, 29]. Additionally, the
acquired TRAIL resistance has also been related to
deficiency in surface DR4/DR5 resulting, at least partly,
from ligand-induced internalization of TRAIL receptors
[13, 30] or insufficient receptor trafficking [31] to the
cell surface membrane. In line with these observations,
several chemotherapy drugs have been shown to enhance
TRAIL-induced apoptosis through upregulation of surface
expression of DR4 and DR5 in different cancer types [32].
Recent evidence suggests a link between TRAIL resistance
and autophagy. Autophagy is a naturally occurring
cellular mechanism that degrades aggregated proteins
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and damaged cellular organelles to maintain cellular
homeostasis, while it can also be stimulated in response
to pathological and physiological cellular stresses [33].
The sequence of cellular events involves the formation
of autophagosomes and fusion with lysosomes to form
autolysosomes wherein autophagic cargos are degraded.
The process is tightly regulated by a complex signaling
network that involves Beclin-1, microtubule-associated
protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3), ATG7, Rab7/9, and
other ATG family proteins. It is well documented that
tumor cells can activate autophagy in response to cellular
stress and/or increased metabolic demands related to
rapid cell proliferation [34-37]. Despite its proapoptotic
effect in some cases [38, 39], tumor-associated autophagy
has been widely implicated in prompting cell growth
and chemoresistance [34-36, 40, 41]. This provides a
strong basis for clinically testing autophagy inhibitors for
cancer treatment [42, 43]. Interestingly, TRAIL has been
shown to induce autophagy in different cancer cell lines,
including those derived from colon [44, 45], glioma [46],
bladder and prostate [47], and breast carcinoma [48, 49].
Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy by pharmacological
inhibitors or by silencing Beclin-1 or ATG7 genes
sensitized TRAIL-resistant cells to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis [45, 48].
We envisioned that tumor-associated autophagy
might play a role in the regulation of subcellular
distribution of TRAIL death receptors. To test this
hypothesis, we examined the basal levels of autophagy in
a panel of 11 breast cancer cell lines and relevant mouse
xenograft models. We found that TRAIL-resistant cells
exhibited a high degree of basal autophagy under normal
growth conditions. Notably, both DR4 and DR5 were found
to co-localize with autophagosomes in TRAIL-resistant
cells. Inhibition of autophagosome formation restored
the expression of the two death receptors on surface
membrane, which was accompanied by a sensitization
to TRAIL induced apoptosis. To our knowledge, this
is the first evidence that autophagosome formation is
directly involved in the downregulation of TRAIL death
receptor expression on the cell surface, thereby inhibiting
TRAIL-induced apoptosis. These findings shed new light
on the role of basal autophagosomes in the regulation of
TRAIL apoptosis signaling. The results warrant further
studies to determine the potential use of autophagosome
markers in prediction of tumor resistance to TRAIL related
therapies. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of basal
autophagosome could be evaluated as a novel means for
combinational therapies with TRAIL agonists for a better
clinical outcome of cancer treatment.

in a panel of 11 breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 1A and Ref.
[50] ). The obtained 50% growth inhibition (GI50) values
allowed us to separate the cell lines into TRAIL-resistant
lines (GI50 > 500 nM; AU565, BT474, HCC1428, MCF7 and MDA-MB-453) and TRAIL-sensitive lines (GI50

< 100 nM; MDA-MB-231, BT549, HCC38, HCC1954,
MDA-MB-157 and Hs578T). To determine the basal
levels of autophagosomes, individual cell lines were
grown in nutrient-rich media per ATCC recommendations.
At 80% confluence, cells were harvested and analyzed by

GI50 values were derived from the dose-response curves and were used to group the cell lines into TRAIL-resistant (GI50 >500 nM) or
TRAIL-sensitive (GI50 <100 nM). (B) LC3 protein expressions in cells grown under healthy conditions. Individual cell lines were cultured
in nutrient-rich medium. At 80% confluence, cells were harvested and analyzed by western blotting. LC3 immunoblots detect two bands:
LC3-I at an apparent mobility of 18 kDa and the lipidated form LC3-II at 16 kDa (moves faster than LC3-I on SDS-PAGE). LC3-II is
known to associate with autophagosomes and therefore serves a marker of active autophagy. β-actin was detected as a loading control. (C)
Densitometry analysis of the immunoblots in (B) yielded the relative levels of LC3-II to LC3-I in individual cell lines. Shown are means
and standard deviations of three independent experiments. TRAIL-sensitive cells are characterized by a LC3-II/LC3-I ratio less than 1
arbitrary unit. Statistical difference in LC3-II/LC3-I ratios between TRAIL-resistant and TRAIL-sensitive cell lines was determined by
Fisher’s PLSD test.

three complementary approaches following the guidelines
for the use of assays for monitoring autophagy [51]. We
first performed immunoblot analysis for the microtubule
associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3). LC3 protein
is involved in the formation of autophagosomes and
its turnover from a cytosolic form LC3-I to a lipidated
form LC3-II (i.e. addition of phosphatidylethanolamine
at Gly120 residue of LC3-I) has been widely used as a
molecular marker of autophagosomes. The results showed
distinct patterns of LC3 expression between TRAILresistant and TRAIL-sensitive cell lines (Fig. 1B & C).
In TRAIL-sensitive cell lines, LC3 existed primarily in
its cytosolic form, LC3-I. By contrast, TRAIL-resistant
cell lines were characterized by an increased level of the
lipidated form, LC3-II. To rule out the possibility of cell
density effects, we cultured the cells at 20%, 50%, and
80% confluence and observed a similar pattern in LC3
expression of two representative cell lines (BT474 and
MDA-MB-231) (Supplement I). Notably, the high ratios
of LC3-II/LC3-I correlated with the observed TRAIL
resistance in the cell lines examined.
We confirmed the high basal levels of

autophagosomes in TRAIL-resistant cell lines using
fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy. Two
representatives of TRAIL-resistant cell lines (BT474 and
AU565) were compared to a TRAIL-sensitive cell line
(MDA-MB-231). To facilitate fluorescence microscopy,
cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid that
expresses RFP-LC3 fusion protein. Compared to MDAMB-231 cells, which showed an evenly distributed
staining of RFP-LC3 red fluorescence, both BT474 and
AU565 cells exhibited punctuate structures that are typical
features of autophagosomes (Fig. 2). Further, electron
microscopy images clearly showed the presence of a large
number of autophagosomes in BT474 and AU565 cells
but not in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3A). The number
of autophagosomes decreased to baseline levels when
the cells were treated with 3-methyladenine (3-MA), a
pharmacological inhibitor of autophagy. Consistently,
silencing of key autophagy regulatory genes (ATG7, LC3,
or Beclin1) effectively abrogated the accumulation of
autophagosomes in BT474 and AU565 cells (Fig. 3B).
These data demonstrate that there are upregulated levels
of basal autophagy in certain breast cancer cell lines even

under healthy growing conditions, which correlates with
the observed resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. To
assess the relevance of the high basal autophagy in a tumor
setting, we established mouse xenograft models using
BT474 and MDA-MB-231 cells. When tumor reached
similar sizes (~0.6 cm3), tumor tissues were harvested
and analyzed by electron microscopy. Consistent with the
cell line data, a large number of autophagosomes were

visualized in the tumors derived from BT474 cells but
were virtually undetected in MDA-MB-231 xenografts
(Fig. 3C).
Suppression of autophagosome formation sensitizes
TRAIL-resistant cells to TRAIL induced apoptosis. To
determine whether the basal autophagy is actively involved
in the development of TRAIL resistance, we tested
the effects of autophagy inhibition on TRAIL induced

cytotoxicity. First, TRAIL-resistant cell lines AU565 and
BT474 were pretreated with 3-MA followed by TRAIL

treatment. While blocking autophagosome formation (Fig.
3A), 3-MA treatment also induced a marked decrease in
cell viability in both cell lines in response to TRAIL (Fig.
4A). The reduction in cell viability directly correlated
with an increased apoptosis index and appearance of
cleaved caspase-8 and caspase-3 (Fig. 4B). To rule out
the off-target effects of 3-MA, we further tested the
effects of silencing the key autophagy regulatory genes,
including ATG7, Beclin 1 and LC3. As shown in Fig. 3B,
transfection of siRNA against the individual autophagic
genes abolished autophagosome formation in TRAILresistant cells. Under similar conditions, knockdown of
ATG7 increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5A) and
caspase activation (Fig. 5B). Similar results were obtained
by silencing Beclin 1 or LC3 (Fig. 5C & D). Collectively,
these data demonstrate that basal autophagy is actively
involved in the development of inherent resistance of
breast cancer cells to TRAIL induced apoptosis.
Autophagosomes mediate downregulation of
surface expression of TRAIL death receptors. We have
previously shown that deficiency of DR4 and DR5 on the
cell surface is a critical mechanism of TRAIL resistance
[12, 13, 29]. In AU565 and BT474 cells, both DR4 and
DR5 were found to be absent on surface membrane despite
the high expression levels of their total proteins [29]. To
understand the molecular basis of TRAIL sensitization
by inhibition of autophagy, we examined the surface
expression of DR4 and DR5 by flow cytometry using
PE-conjugated antibodies specific to each receptor.
Strikingly, knockdown of ATG7 induced a slight but
significant increase in the surface expression of both
death receptors (Fig. 6A), whereas had little or no effect
on their total protein levels (Fig. 6B). As a control, the
surface expression of transferrin receptor (TfR) was not
affected in response to ATG7 depletion. Immunoblotting
analysis also showed that inhibition of autophagy had
no affect on the expressions of several major regulatory
proteins of TRAIL apoptosis signaling pathway, including
c-FLIP, Bcl-2 and IAP family proteins (Supplement
II). While these downstream regulatory components
remain intact and unaffected, the restoration of surface
expression of DR4 and DR5 is likely a direct cause of
the enhanced sensitivity to TRAIL following inhibition of
autophagy. The above observations allowed us to propose
that DR4 and DR5 may be trapped in autophagosomes
in the TRAIL-resistant cells and that, upon inhibition
of autophagy, they may be translocated onto the plasma
membrane where they become accessible to ligand
binding. To test this possibility, we established a stable
BT474 cell line expressing a RFP-LC3 red fluorescence
fusion protein (BT474/RFP-LC3). The stable cells were
subsequently transfected with a plasmid encoding GFPDR4 fusion protein. Confocal microscopy analysis
revealed co-localization of RFP-LC-3 and GFP-DR4 in
punctuate structures (yellow color) in BT474 cells (Fig.
6C). A similar result was obtained for GFP-DR5 and

RFP-LC3 (data not shown). Inhibition of autophagy by
3-MA or by silencing ATG7 disrupted the co-localization
pattern and, strikingly, the resultant cells displayed a
strong staining of GFP-DR4 green fluorescence on the
plasma membrane. Further, we determined the effect
of silencing ATG7 on the ability of TRAIL in inducing
assembly of death inducing signaling complexes (DISC),
which is essential for transmitting an apoptosis signal. To
this end, BT474 and AU565 cells were transfected with
siATG7 and treated with (His)6-TRAIL. DISC components
were affinity purified and analyzed by immunoblotting.
In parental cells, TRAIL failed to efficiently assemble a
DISC as shown by little or barely detectable signals of
the adaptor molecule FADD and pro-caspase 8 (Fig. 6D).
Knockdown of ATG7 significantly increased the levels
of FADD and caspase 8 fragments (p43/41 and p21/18)
in the DISC complexes. Collectively, these data support
a notion that basal autophagy is actively involved in the
downregulation of DR4 and DR5 on cell surface thereby
making the cells resistant to TRAIL induced apoptosis.

Inhibition of lysosomal activity induces an
accumulation of autophagosomes and a loss of surface
DR4 and DR5 in MDA-MB-231 cells. As autophagy
is a highly dynamic process that involves multiple
steps, it is therefore possible that the accumulation of
autophagosomes could result from a genetic background
with upregulated induction of autophagy or, alternatively,
reflect a block in the later stages of the process, such
as impaired autophagosome fusion and lysosomal
degradation [50]. To address this issue, we examined
autophagic flux in these cell lines using lysosomal
protease inhibitors (bafilomycin or chloroquine). As
expected, lysosomal inhibition induced a time-dependent
accumulation of LC3-II protein in all three cell lines (Fig.
7A & B). Surprisingly, the rate of LC3-II accumulation
is much higher in MDA-MB-231 cells compared to
BT474 and AU565 cells. A similar accumulation pattern
was also observed for endogenous p62, DR4, and DR5
proteins. Using stable cell lines that express fluorescent
RFP-LC3, we further showed that MDA-MB-231

cells rapidly accumulated punctuate structures upon
bafilomycin treatment (Fig. 7C). These data support
a low level of autophagic flux activity in BT474 and
AU565 cells, although they both contain high degrees

of autophagosomes. This observation is suggestive of
an insufficient fusion and autolysosome formation or
lack of lysosomal activity or both. MDA-MB-231 cells
appear to undergo a rapid lysosomal turnover, which may

FADD and pro-caspase-8 into the DISC complexes upon TRAIL treatment. Only little DISC components were detected in parental BT474
and AU565 cells which are deficient in surface DR4/DR5 (Fig. 5A). Knockdown of ATG7 enhanced FADD and caspase 8, particularly the
cleaved forms p43/41 and p21/18, in the DISC complexes, while had no effect on their total protein expressions.

explain the lack of basal autophagosomes. However, these
results do not rule out the possibility of differences in the
regulatory proteins upstream of autophagosome formation
between TRAIL-resistant and TRAIL-sensitive cells.
Additional studies are required to determine the molecular
basis of autophagosome accumulation in TRAIL-resistant
cancer cells.
We further determined DR4/DR5 expression in
MDA-MB-231 cells in response to lysosomal inhibition.
Strikingly, both receptors were downregulated from
surface membrane in a time-dependent fashion (Fig.
8A). The resultant cells became less sensitive to

TRAIL-induced apoptosis, as indicated by a delay in the
cleavage of caspase 8 and 3 immediately after TRAIL
treatment (Fig. 8B). We wished to determine a decrease
in apoptosis index after bafilomycin treatment, but this
effort was hindered by the cytotoxicity of inhibitor itself.
Collectively, both inherently occurring and induced
autophagosomes appear to negatively regulate the surface
expression of TRAIL death receptors.

DISCUSSION

which these receptors are mainly localized in intracellular
compartments such as nucleus and others yet to be
characterized [29, 30]. Here we report a novel role of
autophagy in regulation of subcellular localization of
TRAIL receptors. Using complementary approaches, we
show an upregulated formation of autophagosomes in
a panel of TRAIL-resistant breast cancer cell lines and
relevant animal models. We also provide evidence that the
presence of basal autophagosomes is actively involved
in the regulation of surface expression of TRAIL death
receptors. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagosomes
effectively restored the surface expression of DR4
and DR5 without altering their total protein levels.
Importantly, blockage of basal autophagosome formation
sensitized TRAIL-resistant cells (e.g. AU565 and BT474)
to TRAIL induced apoptosis (Fig. 9). These findings
highlight an important role of basal autophagosomes in
the regulation of apoptotic response to TRAIL agonists.
The molecular markers of autophagosomes (e.g. LC3-II/
LC3-I ratio) could be evaluated as an indicator of inherent
TRAIL resistance in tumor cells, and blockade of the
basal autophagosomes may have a potential to improve
the clinical efficacy of TRAIL receptor targeted therapies.
Increasing evidence shows that cancer cells can
lose surface expression of TRAIL death receptors
through a mechanism that is postulated to involve an
accelerated DR4/DR5 endocytosis [13, 30] or insufficient
receptor trafficking [31]. For example, DR5 is localized
in intracellular compartments in NSCLC cells [52] and
breast cancer cells [13, 29]. The present data demonstrate
that TRAIL-resistant breast cancer cells (e.g. AU565 and
BT474) contain high basal levels of autophagosomes
(Figs. 1, 2 and 3). Strikingly, DR4 and DR5 are found to
co-localize with LC3-II within autophagosomes and, upon
disruption of autophagosome formation, translocate to the
plasma membrane (Fig. 6 and not shown for DR5). This
intriguing observation may be explained by recruitment of
the endocytosed receptors or by an alternative mechanism
in which autophagosomes engulf plasma membranes
containing the receptors. In support the latter possibility, it
has been shown that autophagosomes acquire membranes
from sources including the plasma membrane [53].
In a canonical mode, autophagosomes fuse with
lysosomes to form autolysosomes wherein degrade
autophagic cargos for recycling of nutrients (to meet
metabolic demands). Surprisingly, the steady-state protein
levels of DR4 and DR5 in AU565 and BT474 cells are
comparable to those of MDA-MB-231 cells lacking
basal autophagosomes (Fig. 6B). Moreover, the total
protein levels of DR4 and DR5 was virtually unchanged
by silencing ATG7 (data not shown) or treatment with
lysosomal inhibitors (Fig. 7). Interestingly, inhibition of
lysosomal activity resulted in an accumulation of DR4
and DR5 proteins in MDA-MB-231 cells at a much
faster rate when compared to BT474 and AU565 cell
lines. This phenomenon is elusive at this time and we

Overcoming tumor resistance is the key to success
of development of TRAIL receptor targeted therapies
for cancer treatment. Our laboratory investigates the
mechanisms underlying TRAIL resistance with aims
at identifying biomarkers for prediction of tumor
resistance to the targeted therapies and also identifying
novel molecular targets for therapeutic intervention
for improved anticancer efficacy [12, 13, 29, 30, 50].
We have previously shown an aberrant expression of
TRAIL death receptors in certain cancer cell lines in

(A) Cells were treated with BafA1 (100 nM) at 37°C for 0, 2,
4 or 24 h, stained with PE-conjugated antibodies specific to
DR4, DR5 or transferrin receptor (TfR), and analyzed by flow
cytometry as in Fig. 6. Shown are representatives from three
independent measurements. (B) Cells were pretreated with
BafA1 (100 nM) for 24 h and followed by rhTRAIL (20 ng/mL)
for additional 5, 15 or 30 min. A delay in cleavage of caspase 8
(C-8) and C-3) was detected in BafA-1 treated cells. RhoGDI, a
caspase-resistant protein, was used as a loading control.

speculate that there might be an impaired autolysosome
formation or a deficiency in lysosomal activity or
both. In this aspect, accumulation of autophagosomes
has been shown to be related to inefficient fusion of
autophagosomes with endosomes and/or lysosomes [54],
or alternatively, to inefficient degradation of the cargo
once fusion has occurred [55]. It is also possible that some
cancer cells (e.g. BT474 and AU565) harbor a genetic
background in favor of the induction of autophagosomes.
Autophagosomes are thought to be efficient carriers
of a broad spectrum of cellular antigens which may
include tumor cell surface receptors [56]. Although the
composition of autophagosomes is not clearly defined,
a tumor-derived autophagosome vaccine has shown
potent antitumor activity in preclinical studies [57]. Our
data suggest that death receptors may be sequestered
in the basal autophagosomes of tumor cells and may
present as immunogens in the autophagosome-enriched
vaccine. Studies are underway in our laboratory to
isolate and characterize basal autophagosomes for their
protein contents. Nonetheless, the accumulation of basal
autophagosomes closely correlates with the deficiency of
surface DR4 and DR5 and cellular resistance to rhTRAIL
and monoclonal antibodies to DR4 or DR5 (Fig. 1).
Despite the opposing roles of autophagy in

regulating cell death or cell survival, abundant
evidence favor its cytoprotective role in the context of
chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Recent research has
shown that some cancer cells, particularly those driven
by the K-Ras oncogene, depend on elevated levels of
autophagy for survival and transformation even in the
absence of external stressors [58]. Autophagy is also
linked to primary resistance to HER2-targeted therapies in
breast cancer treatment [59]. As a result, multiple clinical
trials are ongoing to evaluate autophagy inhibitors (e.g.
chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) for cancer treatment
[42]. TRAIL has been shown to induce autophagy in cells
derived from colon [44, 45], glioma [46], bladder and
prostate [47] and breast carcinoma [48, 49]. In support of a
cytoprotective role for autophagy, we show that disruption
of basal autophagosomes sensitized TRAIL-resistant
cells (BT575 and AU565) to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
However, blockade of autophagic flux by inhibiting
lysosomal activity made TRAIL-sensitive cells (MDAMB-231) less sensitive to TRAIL (Fig. 7 & 8). This data
suggests that targeting the different steps of the autophagy
machinery may elicit opposite effects on TRAIL-induced
apoptosis, depending possibly on cell types, tumor stages,
and the status of basal autophagosomes. Additional
studies are warranted to evaluate the therapeutic

Figure 9: Schematic representation of the basal autophagosome mediated cellular resistance to TRAIL induced
apoptosis. In MDA-MB-231 cells, TRAIL binds DR4 and/or DR5 expressed on cell surface, thereby recruiting adaptor protein Fas-

associated death domain (FADD) and pro-caspase 8 into a death inducing signaling complex (DISC). Within the DISC, caspase 8 undergoes
self-cleavage and activation which triggers the caspase cascade, cleavage of structural proteins, and eventually apoptosis. Both BT474
and AU565 cells are characterized by high basal level of autophagosomes that sequester DR4 and DR5, which may contribute to their
deficiency on cell surface. Disruption of autophagosome structures (e.g. by 3-MA or siATG7) restores the surface expression of DR4 and
DR5 which make the cells susceptible to TRAIL induced apoptosis.

potential of autophagy inhibitors, especially inhibitors of
autophagosome assembly versus those blocking lysosomal
activity (e.g. bafilomycin and chloroquine).
The autophagosome mediated downregulation
of surface TRAIL death receptors may also have an
implication in understanding the role of autophagy
in promoting tumor progression. TRAIL is primarily
produced by immune cells (e.g. T cells and Natural
Killer cells) and is present in circulation and tissue
microenvironment where it serves as immunosurveillance
for malignant cells by inducing cell death through the
surface DR4 and/or DR5. When the death receptors are
deficient in the cell surface, a “malignant” cell could
escape from TRAIL mediated surveillance, which
promotes tumor formation and metastasis. Consistent
with our data, basal autophagy has also been found in
pancreatic [60], melanoma [61], and non-small lung
cancer cells [62]. Thus, it is reasonable to propose that
accumulation of autophagosomes contributes to tumor
progression through downregulation of death receptor
mediated apoptosis.
In summary, we show an accumulation of
autophagosomes in TRAIL-resistant breast cancer
cells under nutrient-rich conditions. The presence of
autophagosomes appears to negatively regulate the
surface expression of TRAIL receptors, thereby blocking
TRAIL induced apoptosis. It will require further study
to elucidate the molecular basis of the upregulated basal
autophagosomes and the signaling events involved in
DR4/DR5 subcellular localization. Nonetheless, these
findings have several potential therapeutic implications.
Immunostaining of autophagosome markers such as LC3II could be evaluated as predictive markers of tumor
resistance to TRAIL related therapies. Furthermore,
the data raise a caution on the selection of autophagy
inhibitors for combination with TRAIL receptor targeted
therapies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell viability.
Cell viability was determined by a colorimetric
assay
using
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). Briefly, cells (10,000
cells/ per well) were seeded onto 96-well plates and pretreated with 3-MA or individual siRNA followed by
treatment with rhTRAIL (100 ng/ml). The medium was
changed to 100 μL of MTT solution (Sigma, M2128; 2 mg/
ml) and incubated at 37°C for 2 h. The resulting crystals
were dissolved in 100 μL of DMSO and absorbance at
562 nm was used to calculate the cell viability relative
to the untreated cells. Apoptosis Assay. Apoptosis was
determined by flow cytometry as previously described
[13]. Briefly, cells were grown on 6-well plates to ~50%
confluence and treated similarly as described above. For
siRNA assays, cells were transiently transfected with the
specific siRNA for 72 h and then incubated with rhTRAIL

Cell lines and reagents.
The human breast cancer cell lines AU565,
BT474, HCC1428, MCF-7, MDA-MB-453, BT549,
HCC38, HCC1954, MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-231
and Hs578T were purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC), where the cell lines were
tested and authenticated by growth rate, morphology,
isoenzymology, short tandem repeat profiling, and
Mycoplasma testing (www.ATCC.org). All the cell lines
were cultured per ATCC recommendations and tested
to be free of mycoplasma contamination at receiving
and on a monthly basis. Recombinant human TRAIL

(100 ng/ml) for an additional 24 h. The resultant cells
were labeled by Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide
(PI) using the Apoptosis Dectection Kit (Calbiochem,
PF032) and analyzed on FACS Calibur (BD Biosciences)
with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson).

After centrifugation, supernatant was subject to western
blotting analysis.

Immunoblotting.

Stable BT474/RFP-LC3 cells were cultured onto
Nunc Labtek Chambered cover glass (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, 155383) and transiently transfected with GFPDR4 or GFP-DR5 plasmids. After 24 h post-transfection,
cells were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma,
H3570) and subject to confocal imaging using the Zeiss
Cell Observer Spinning Disk Confocal Microscope
system. An oil immersion 63x objective lens (NA=1.4)
was used for all optical imaging. Three laser lines (405,
488 and 561 nm) were used for Hoechst 33342, GFP and
RFP and all samples were imaged with these 3 channels.
The emission filters for image acquisition of Hoechst
33342, GFP and RFP are 450/50 nm, 525/50 nm and
629/62 nm, respectively. All images were saved and stored
as zvi format for further data analysis. All images were
representative of 3 independent experiments.

Immunofluorescence microscopy.

Whole cell lysates were prepared using a lysis
buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM
NaCl, 0.25% deoxycholic acid, 1% NP-40, 1 mM
EDTA. Protein concentrations were estimated using the
bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce Biotechnology,
23235). Equal amounts of cell lysates (60 μg per lane)
were resolved by SDS-PAGE using a 4%-12% NuPAGE
Bis-Tris gel (Life Technologies, NP0321BOX) and
transferred to PVDF membranes. Immunoblotting
analyses were performed using primary antibodies at an
appropriate dilution (1:500 to 1:1,000). When necessary,
the membranes were stripped by Restore Western Blot
Stripping Buffer (Pierce Biotechnology, 21059) and
reprobed with appropriate antibodies. Immunocomplexes
were visualized by chemiluminescence using Immobilon
Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore,
WBKLS0500). Densitometry analysis was performed with
the LAS-4000 Luminescent Image Analyzer (Fujifilm).
Cell surface expression of death receptors. The cell
surface expression of DR4 and DR5 was assessed by
flow cytometry using the phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated
antibodies as described previously.[13] Briefly, cells
(~5 x 106) were incubated in a blocking solution (5 %
normal goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin in
PBS) for 20min on ice, and then incubated with 10 µL
of PE-conjugated primary antibodies for 45 min at 4°C
on ice in dark. Duplicate samples were incubated with
the respective IgG1-PE or IgG2b-PE as negative controls.
The cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in
200µL PBS for FACS analysis.

Electron Microscopy.
Cells were grown on thermonax plastic coverslips
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, 174950) and fixed in a mixture
of paraformaldehyde (2.5%, Electron Microscopy
Sciences, 15710) and gluteraldehyde (2.0%, Electron
Microscopy Sciences, 16000) in phosphate saline (PBS)
for 1 h. After extensive wash in PBS, the slides were
rinsed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (SB; pH=
7.4, Electron Microscopy Sciences, 11652) and postfixed in 1.0% osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy
Sciences, 19150) mixed with 0.8% potassium ferricyanide
(Electron Microscopy Sciences, 20150) for 1 h. The
resultant samples were dehydrated in a series of ethanol
(30%, 50%, 75%, 95% for 5 min and 100% for 30 min
with three repeats) and infiltrated with Epon-Aradite
(Electron Microscopy Sciences, 13940) for 1-2 days
(30% of Epon-Araldite and ethanol for 2 h, 50% for 4 h,
75% for overnight and 100% for 24 h with 2 changes).
The samples were polymerized at 60°C for 24h and were
cut into ultrathin sections (~ 80 nm) using Leica EM UC6
Ultramicrotome (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL) and collected
on copper slot grids. Sections were counterstained with
uranyl acetate(Electron Microscopy Sciences, 22400) and
lead citrate(Electron Microscopy Sciences,17800), and
examined under the FEI Tecnai12 transmission electron
microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, Oregon) operating at the
beam energy of 120keV. Images were acquired using the
Gatan 2k x 2k cooled CCD camera (Gatan, Warrendale,
PA).

DISC formation assay.
TRAIL induced DISC formation was analyzed as
described previously [31]. Briefly, cells (1 × 107) were
incubated with 1 μg/mL of (His)6-rhTRAIL at 37°C for
1 h. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold 1xPBS
and lysed for 30 min on ice in a lysis buffer [30 mmol/L
Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton
X-100] supplemented with protease inhibitors and 5
mmol/L imidazole (Sigma, I2399). The cells lysates were
cleared twice by centrifugation at 4°C. Equal amounts of
extracts were incubated with 60 μL Nickel-NTA agarose
beads (Qiagen, 1018244) at 4°C for 1 h. The affinity
complexes were subsequently washed three times with
lysis buffer including protease inhibitors and incubated
with 1 mol/L imidazole for 10 min at room temperature.

Animal studies were performed following the
institutional approved animal protocol (Center for
Biological Evaluation and Research, WO-2006-50).
Briefly, BT474 (1x107 cells in 150 µL medium) or MDAMB-231 cells (5x106 cells in 150 µL medium) were
injected subcutaneously (s.c.) at the right flank of nude
mice (Athymic NCr-nu, female, 4-weeks old). Ten mice
were used for each cell line. Given that BT474 cells
require estrogen to grow in vivo (Liang Y et al. 2007), mice
were implanted a 60-day release pellet of 17β-estradiol
(Innovative Research Company, SE-121) under the skin of
lateral side of the neck using trochar (Innovative Research
Company, MP-182) 2 days prior to injection of BT474
cells. Tumor growth was monitored daily until the tumor
volume reached 0.6 cm3. Tumors were then removed and
fixed in formalin and analyzed by electron microscopy.
