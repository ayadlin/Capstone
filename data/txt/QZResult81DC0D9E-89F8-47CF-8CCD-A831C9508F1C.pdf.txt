ABSTRACT
Aims: We aimed to investigate the clinical significance of GPx3 in hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) and to characterize its tumor suppressive role.
Methods: HCC patients (113) who underwent hepatectomy were recruited to
examine the clinical relevance of GPx3. The tumor suppressive role of GPx3 was
studied by administration of recombinant GPx3 (rGPx3) or over-expression of GPx3
in HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. The therapeutic value of GPx3 for HCC was further
investigated using human induced pluripotent stem cell derived mesenchymal stem
cells (hiPSC-MSCs) as its delivery vehicle.
Results: Down-regulation of GPx3 significantly correlated with advanced
tumor stage (P = 0.024), venous infiltration (P = 0.043) and poor overall survival
(P = 0.007) after hepatectomy. Lower plasma GPx3 in HCC patients was significantly
associated with larger tumor size (P = 0.011), more tumor nodules (P = 0.032) and
higher recurrence (P = 0.016). Over-expression of GPx3 or administration of rGPx3
significantly inhibited proliferation and invasiveness of HCC cells in vitro and
in vivo. Tumor suppressive activity of GPx3 was mediated through Erk-NFκB-SIP1
pathway. GPx3 could be delivered by hiPSC-MSCs into the tumor and exhibited tumor
suppressive activity in vivo.
Conclusions: GPx3 is a tumor suppressor gene in HCC and may possess prognostic
and therapeutic value for HCC patients.

Glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3) was found to be
up-regulated in acute phase injury as an anti-oxidant to
protect the organ from oxidative stress by detoxifying
hydrogen peroxide and other free radicals [5, 6]. It has also
been noticed that expression of GPx3 is significantly downregulated within tumor tissues in several types of cancers.
The mRNA level of GPx3 is down-regulated in esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma due to epigenetic silence [7].
The down-regulation of GPx3 was also observed in
Barrett’s adenocarcinoma because of DNA methylation
[8]. Much lower expression levels of GPx3 were observed
in colorectal cancer compared with non-tumor tissues [9].
Besides the down-regulation of GPx3 within tumor tissues,

INTRODUCTION
Oxidative stress is fatal to normal cells. In contrast,
it plays a key role in cell survival and proliferation of
several types of cancer [1]. Unlimited proliferation of
cancer cells, to some extent, relies on intracellular oxidants
such as reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oxidative stress
could cause genetic mutation [2], up-regulate signaling
pathways that control cell survival and invasiveness [3]
and provide favorable micro-environment for cancer
development [4]. Therefore, attenuation of oxidative
stress post-operation or combined with chemotherapy may
provide new insights for cancer treatment.

the circulating GPx3 was also found to be much lower in
the patients with glioblastoma than non-patients which
implies that it may possess the prognostic value for cancer
patients [10]. Although the down-regulation of GPx3 was
shown in several malignancies, the clinical significance
and functional role of GPx3 in cancer development have
not been well illustrated.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most
common cancer and ranks as high as third for cancerrelated deaths worldwide [11]. Although tumor resection
and liver transplantation are effective treatments for
selected HCC patients, tumor recurrence remains a main
concern [12–14]. Furthermore, surgical treatment is not
applicable for patients with advanced tumor stages [15–18].
Development of a new approach to prevent tumor
recurrence and improve prognosis is an urgent need for
HCC patients. The role of anti-oxidant in treatment of
HCC patients has not been illustrated. So far, there is no
information about the role of GPx3 in HCC. Exploration
of functional role of GPx3 in HCC could provide new
evidences to apply anti-oxidant agents for cancer therapy.
Firstly, we examined the clinical significance of
GPx3 in HCC patients and found that lower expression of
GPx3 in tumors could predict the advanced tumor stage
and higher probability of tumor recurrence. Secondly,
we explored the tumor suppressive activity of GPx3
in vitro by administration of rGPx3 or forced expression
of GPx3 in different liver cancer cell lines. Thirdly, we
demonstrated the anti-tumor effect of GPx3 in vivo using
ectopic and orthotopic liver cancer models. Fourthly, we
found that the tumor suppressive activity of GPx3 was
mediated by inhibition of EMT (Epithelial-Mesenchymal
Transition) through Erk-NFκB-SIP1 signaling pathway.
Finally, we explored the therapeutic value of GPx3 for
HCC using hiPSC-MSCs as a delivery vehicle. This is the
first study to suggest the prognostic and therapeutic value
of GPx3 in HCC patients.

On the other hand, the adjacent non-tumor tissue could
be generally perceived as “pre-cancer” disease. Our
results showed that GPx3 was already significantly
down-regulated in such “pre-cancer” tissues. It implied
that down-regulation of GPx3 may not only be involved
in tumor progression, but also tumor development or
carcinogenesis. Consistent with mRNA levels, the protein
levels of GPx3 were also found down-regulated in tumor
tissues (Fig. 1B). IHC staining also confirmed that lower
expression of GPx3 was detected within tumor tissues
(Fig. 1C).

Down-regulation of GPx3 mRNA significantly
correlated with advanced tumor stage and poor
prognosis in HCC patients
The association of GPx3 mRNA with
clinicopathological parameters was analyzed (Table 1).
Down-regulation of GPx3 was significantly correlated
with advanced pTNM stage (P = 0.024), presence of
venous infiltration (P = 0.043) and high AFP level
(P = 0.006). The five year recurrence (P = 0.019) was
significantly higher in the patients with GPx3 downregulation. No significant association of GPx3 expression
was detected with sex, age, tumor size, number of tumor
nodules and presence of hepatitis B surface antigen.
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the
down-regulation of GPx3 mRNA was significantly
correlated with poor overall survival of HCC patients
(Log rank = 7.297, P = 0.007, Fig. 1A, right panel). The
estimated mean overall survival time of the patients with
GPx3 down-regulation was 58.72±6.94 months, which
was significantly lower than that of patients without GPx3
down-regulation (86.46±6.85 months). The independent
predictor for overall survival was further identified
among GPx3, pTNM stage, venous infiltration and
AFP using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis
(Table S1). In univariable analysis, down-regulation of
GPx3 (HR=2.084, 95%CI: 1.209–3.593, P = 0.008) was
significantly associated with overall survival. However,
in multivariable analysis, only venous infiltration
(HR=3.003, 95%CI: 1.259–7.160, P = 0.013) was
identified as an independent predictor.

RESULTS
Expression of GPx3 was down-regulated within
tumor tissues in HCC patients
The average mRNA level of GPx3 was significantly
lower within tumor tissues compared with adjacent nontumor tissues and normal liver tissues (Fig. 1A, left panel).
The down-regulation of GPx3 in tumor tissues compared
with adjacent non-tumor tissues was observed in 50%
of HCC patients (56/113). It seemed that the difference
between normal and diseased samples were larger than that
between tumor and non-tumor tissues (Fig. 1A, left panel).
There are two possible explanations. On one hand, HCC is
regarded as inflammation associated cancer, which always
develops with the background of cirrhosis. In such types
of cancer, the chronic inflammation is always inevitable
and would cause the lower level of GPx3 expression.

Lower plasma GPx3 significantly correlated with
tumor progression and tumor recurrence
in HCC patients
The area under the ROC curve of plasma GPx3
was 0.643 (0.534–0.751) for prediction of five year
recurrence. The value (4.842µg/mL) with a maximized
Youden index was selected as the cutoff point by which
all the patients were segregated into two groups: low and
high level group. The larger tumor size (P = 0.011) and
higher number of tumor nodules (P = 0.032) were found
in the GPx3 low level group. The five year recurrence rate

and invasiveness of HCC cells in vitro

process. GPx3 significantly inhibited EMT which was
stimulated by TGF-β in MHCC97L (Fig. 5A). GPx3
restored the expression of E-cadherin (epithelial marker)
and decreased expression of Vimentin (mesenchymal
marker) of MHCC97L.
In order to further investigate the underlying
mechanism of inhibitory effect of GPx3 on EMT, several
transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin that are commonly
involved in EMT process, such as Slug, Snail, Zeb1, SIP1
and Twist, were selected for detection. In our case, SIP1
was shown to be most significantly suppressed by GPx3
treatment independent of TGF-β stimulation (Fig. 5B).

Administration of rGPx3 inhibited the proliferation
of MHCC97L, Hep3B and Huh7, whose GPx3 was
relatively low (Fig. 2B). The proliferation of HCC
cells was most significantly suppressed by rGPx3 at
the concentration of 2µg/mL, which was shown to be
non-toxic to normal liver cells (MIHA) (Fig. 2B). The
invasiveness of MHCC97L, Hep3B and Huh7 was also
suppressed by administration of rGPx3 (Fig. 2C). The
number of migrated cells was significantly lower upon
rGPx3 administration in the Matrigel invasion assay
(Fig. 2D).
Over-expression of GPx3 was established in
Huh7 and MHCC97L. The clones with the highest
expression of GPx3 were picked up for further
investigation (Fig. S1A and B). We also confirmed that
secreted GPx3 was significantly increased in the culture
medium after transfection (Fig. 3A). It implied that the
forcedly expressed GPx3 could be successfully secreted
extracellularly. Over-expression of GPx3 significantly
inhibited the proliferation (Fig. 3B) of Huh7 and
MHCC97L in MTT assay. Moreover, in colony formation
assay, the colony number and size were both significantly
lower in GPx3 over-expression group (Fig. 3C).
Furthermore, the invasiveness was also significantly
suppressed by over-expression of GPx3 in Huh7 and
MHCC97L (Fig. 3D).

GPx3 suppressed SIP1 expression through
inhibition of Nuclear Factor κB (NFκB)
activation
NFκB was reported to be directly involved in EMT
process and is the key mediator for SIP1 expression [19].
In our study, SIP1 expression could be regulated by NFκB
pathway as administration of specific NFκB inhibitor
(PDTC) suppressed SIP1 expression (Fig. 5C, left panel).
Furthermore, NFκB nuclear translocation was significantly
attenuated upon rGPx3 administration, indicating that
activation of NFκB could be inhibited by GPx3 treatment
(Fig. 5C, right panel). Thus, GPx3 treatment might inhibit
NFκB activation, which would further suppress SIP1
expression.

GPx3 inhibited NFκB activation through
deactivation of Extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (Erk)

Over-expression of GPx3 suppressed tumor
growth and invasiveness in vivo

PI3K-AKT
and
Ras-MEK-Erk
signaling
pathways are both commonly involved in liver cancer
progression and are reported to be the activators of
the NFκB signaling pathway [20, 21]. In our case, the
activated form of AKT remained unchanged upon rGPx3
administration (Fig. S2A). However, significant inhibition
of Erk activation was observed upon rGPx3 administration
(Fig.  5D, left panel). Furthermore, activation of NFκB
could be regulated by the Erk pathway as evidenced by
how the administration of specific Erk inhibitor (U0126)
deactivated NFκB-p65 (Fig. 5D, right panel). Thus,
GPx3 might inhibit Erk activation, which would further
deactivate NFκB signaling pathway. The same trend could
also be observed in orthotopic liver cancer model that
activation of NFκB was inhibited by the over-expression
of GPx3 through deactivation of Erk (Fig. 5E).

In nude mice ectopic liver cancer model, the tumor
growth rate of MHCC97L-GPx3-2 was significantly lower
compared with vector control (Fig. 4A and B). In nude
mice orthotopic liver cancer model, tumor volume was
significantly lower in MHCC97L-GPx3-2 group (Fig. 4C).
The over-expression of GPx3 in MHCC97L-GPx3-2 group
was also confirmed 5 weeks after tumor implantation
(Fig. 4D). It implied that forced-expression of GPx3 could
be sustained in vivo and secreted extracellularly. A relatively
clear margin between tumor and adjacent non-tumor
tissues was found in the MHCC97L-GPx3-2 group. On the
contrary, invasive patterns of tumor growth were present in
vector control group (Fig. 4E). The results showed that overexpression of GPx3 suppressed tumor invasiveness in vivo.

Erk signaling pathway, such as Raf and MEK, were not
changed upon GPx3 treatment (Fig. S2A). It implied that
deactivation of Erk by GPx3 may not be mediated through
Raf-MEK pathway. It was reported that the negative
feedback of Erk activation was regulated by MKP3 [22],
which was Erk phosphatase and widely expressed in liver
tissue. In our case, MKP3 was significantly up-regulated
upon rGPx3 treatment in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 5F,
left panel). Furthermore, GPx3 could attenuate EGF
(Epidermal Growth Factor) and HGF (Hepatocyte Growth
Factor) induced Erk activation through the restoration of
MKP3 expression (Fig. 5F, right panel). Thus, the inhibitory
effect of GPx3 on Erk activation might be mediated through
up-regulation of MKP3, which could maintain the negative
feedback loop of Erk activation (Fig. S3). Moreover, our
study showed that expression of MKP3 could be negatively
regulated by H2O2 level (Fig. 5G). Thus, the restoration of
MKP3 expression by GPx3 might be mediated through
elimination of H2O2 due to the detoxification of GPx3.

volume was significantly lower in the hiPSC-MSC-GPx3
treatment group when nude mice were sacrificed (Fig. 7B).
The kinetic images of tumor growth also showed that
hiPSC-MSC-GPx3 treatment significantly suppressed
orthotopic tumor growth in vivo (Fig. 7C). According
to immunoflorescence and IHC staining, human hiPSCMSCs could be traced within tumor tissues (Fig. 7D,
middle panel). Moreover, GPx3 expression could be
detected at the same area at which hiPSC-MSC-GPx3
cells were located (Fig. 7D, lower panel). It implied that
GPx3 could be successfully delivered by hiPSC-MSCs
into tumor tissues.

DISCUSSION
We demonstrated that the lower plasma GPx3
indicated tumor recurrence and shorter disease-freesurvival period of HCC patients after liver resection.
The down-regulation of GPx3 within tumor tissue also
significantly correlated with advanced tumor stage and
appearance of venous infiltration in HCC patients. These
findings implied that GPx3 may possess prognostic value
to predict HCC progression and recurrence. Although
numerous biomarkers have been studied in past decades,
the serological detection of HCC recurrence mainly relies
on the traditional marker AFP [4, 24]. However, the
positive predictive value (PPV) of AFP is not satisfied
[25]. Furthermore, as the secreted proteins originated
from tumors, AFP does not possess therapeutic value for
HCC patients. So far, there is no promising biomarker
possessing both prognostic and therapeutic value for HCC
patients. In addition to indicating the clinical significance
of GPx3, we also illustrated that over-expression of GPx3
in HCC cells significantly suppressed tumor proliferation
and invasiveness in vitro and in vivo. More importantly,
we demonstrated, for the first time that the tumor
suppressive activity of GPx3 delivered by hiPSC-MSCs
indicated the therapeutic potential of hiPSC-MSC-GPx3
for HCC patients. Based on the advantages that patient
specific hiPSC-MSCs could be prepared as an “off-theshelf” source with a higher capacity of self-renewal
and engraftment [23], the clinical application of hiPSCMSC-GPx3 may be a practical choice to prevent tumor
recurrence and improve prognosis of HCC patients after
liver surgery.
Epigenetic hypermethylation and genome deletion
are reported as two reasons for the down-regulation of
GPx3 during cancer development [7, 8, 26, 27], but the
mechanism of down-regulation of GPx3 contributing to
tumor progression remains to be investigated. GPx3 has
been reported to commit its tumor suppressive activity
through inhibition of c-Met expression in prostate cancer
[28]. However, we did not find any difference of c-Met
expression in HCC cell lines with forced expression of
GPx3 (Fig. S2B). It indicated that tumor suppressive
activity of GPx3 through down-regulation of c-Met may be

Engineered hiPSC-MSCs delivering
GPx3 was established
In order to explore the therapeutic value of GPx3 using
hiPSC-MSCs as a delivery vehicle in HCC, we established
the engineered hiPSC-MSCs delivering GPx3. Full length
of human GPx3 gene was transduced into the hiPSC-MSC
cell line [23]. The transduction efficiency was confirmed to
be nearly 100% (Fig. S4A). The protein level of intracellular
GPx3 and secreted GPx3 in culture medium were both
confirmed to be significantly elevated after transduction
(Fig. S4B). The stem cell property of hiPSC-MSCs was still
maintained after transduction as evidenced by positive and
negative markers detected using flow cytometry (Fig. S5).

Engineered hiPSC-MSCs delivering GPx3
significantly suppressed tumor growth in vitro
The significant inhibitory effect of hiPSC-MSCGPx3 on the proliferation of MHCC97L cells was
observed when the cell number ratio reached 2:1 or 1:1
(MHCC97L:hiPSC-MSC-GPx3) in MTT assay (Fig. 6A).
In order to avoid the influence of proliferation of hiPSCMSCs in detection, hiPSC-MSC-GPx3 was co-cultured
with MHCC97L cells labeled with luciferase (Fig. 6B).
The bioluminescence of MHCC97L was significantly
lower in the hiPSC-MSC-GPx3 group. It implied that
hiPSC-MSC-GPx3 could significantly suppress the
proliferation of MHCC97L cells (Fig. 6C).

that the tumor suppressive function of GPx3 was mediated
through induction of apoptosis in prostate and colon cancer
[29, 30]. However, in our study, no significant effect of
GPx3 on apoptosis of HCC cells was observed (Fig. S1C).
Consistently, we did not find any change in cell survival
pathway, such as AKT pathway, after over-expression
of GPx3 (Fig. S2A). It implied that other underlying
mechanism might be existed for tumor suppressive activity
of GPx3 in liver cancer. This is the first study to show that
rGPx3 suppressed invasiveness of HCC cells by inhibition
of EMT through Erk-NFκB-SIP1 signaling pathway.
It has been reported that activation of NFκB could be
determined by the Erk pathway [31]. It was consistent
with our results. In addition, the regulatory effect of
NFκB on SIP1 expression is also supported by Julien,
who demonstrated that activation of NFκB promotes SIP1
expression which further suppresses E-cadherin expression
[32]. We identified that only inhibition of SIP1, among five
E-cadherin transcriptional repressors, was responsible
for restoration of E-cadherin by rGPx3. So far, there is
no promising SIP1 inhibitor for cancer therapy except
for epigenetic silencing [33], in which the negative side
effects may be inevitable. Besides that, the application
of inhibitors of the NFκB pathway for cancer therapy is
still at an early stage because of several severe side effects
[34]. The hiPSC-MSC-GPx3 treatment with property of
tumor tropism may be prospective for clinical utilization
of cancer target therapy in HCC patients.
In addition to anti-invasiveness, significantly
inhibitory effect of GPx3 or hiPSC-MSC-GPx3 on
proliferation of HCC cells was also observed in vitro and
in vivo. We found that GPx3 could maintain negative
feedback of Erk activation by up-regulation of MKP3,
which further deactivated the NFκB pathway. The inhibitory
effect of GPx3 on Erk-NFκB activation might be able to
explain the suppressive effect of GPx3 on both proliferation
and invasiveness of HCC cells. This was confirmed in our
animal model (Fig. 5E). Further research is required to
understand whether there are other potential mechanisms
involved in the tumor suppressive activity of GPx3.
Engineered MSC with an anti-tumor agent was
reported as a novel strategy for cancer therapy with
the advantage of fewer systemic side effects [35, 36].
However, the self-renewal capacity of bone-marrowderived-MSCs (BM-MSCs) was significantly deteriorated
with aging [37]. The hiPSC-MSCs were discovered to
possess a higher capacity of self-renewal with telomerase
activity 10-fold higher than BM-MSCs [23]. Thus, it was
of our great interest to explore the therapeutic value of
GPx3 using hiPSC-MSCs as a delivery vehicle for HCC.
The co-localization of hiPSC-MSCs and GPx3 expressions
detected within tumor tissues highly implied that GPx3
can be successfully delivered by hiPSC-MSCs into the
tumor site. This finding might provide a new delivery
strategy for GPx3 in liver cancer target therapy.

We suggested that the lower circulating GPx3
possessed prognostic value for HCC patients. We not
only investigated the clinical significance, but also further
demonstrated the tumor suppressive role of GPx3 in HCC
in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we discovered the potential
mechanism of GPx3 that suppressed invasiveness of tumor
by inhibition of EMT through the Erk-NFκB-SIP1 signaling
pathway. Most importantly, we further demonstrated
therapeutic value of GPx3 using hiPSC-MSCs as a delivery
vehicle in liver cancer models. Further investigation is
required to explore the therapeutic effect of hiPSC-MSCGPx3 combined with other anti-tumor agents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The flow diagram of study design is shown in
Fig. S6. In clinical association study, the correlation
of GPx3 expression with clinicopathological features
and survival outcome were investigated in 113 HCC
patients, who had undergone hepatectomy. In functional
study, the effects of GPx3 on HCC cells were examined
by administration of rGPx3 and forced expression of
GPx3 in HCC cells in vitro, and the in vivo role of GPx3
was explored in ectopic and orthotopic xenograft liver
cancer models. In mechanism study, effects of GPx3 on
the EMT process and the activation of Erk-NFκB-SIP1
pathway were further explored. In translational study, the
therapeutic value of GPx3 in HCC was explored using
hiPSC-MSCs as a delivery vehicle in vitro and in vivo.

Clinical association study
Clinical specimens
The study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of the University of Hong Kong / Hospital
Authority Hong Kong West Cluster. 113 HCC patients
who had undergone curative partial hepatectomy
between November 1999 and May 2009 were recruited
with informed consent from the Department of Surgery,
Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong. All
the patients were diagnosed with primary HCC and the
patients with severe systemic disorder or combined with
other tumors were excluded from the study. The median
of follow up time was 6 years (2 months–11 years). The
median age of the patients was 55 (22–81) years old.
Eighty one percent of patients were male. Eighty eight
percent of patients were HBsAg positive. One hundred
and thirteen pairs of fresh tumor tissue and adjacent nontumor tissue samples were collected from HCC patients
and 10 normal liver tissue samples were collected from
donors during operation. One hundred and seven plasma
samples were collected within a week pre-operation.

penetrated through the membrane of chamber were
fixed by methanol at -20ºC for 20min, stained with
0.1% crystal violet for 1h and finally counted under a light
microscope. The experiment was performed in triplicate.

The mRNA level of GPx3 was determined by
qRT-PCR. The protein level of GPx3 was detected by
IHC and Western-blot as previously described [38]. GPx3
primary anti-body (Abcam) was used in immunostaining.
The sequences of primers used were recorded (Table S2).

In Vivo functional study
Nude mice ectopic tumorigenesis model
MHCC97L cells (1 × 106 cells in 100ul saline)
were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of the
nude mice (6–8weeks, male) under anaesthesia with
an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital. When
the tumor developed, the size was measured every
4 days for 3 weeks. The volume of the tumor was
calculated as follows: tumor volume (mm3) = 1/2 ×
length × width2. Tumor weight was measured when the
mice were sacrificed at 4 weeks after the injection of tumor
cells. Tumor tissues were harvested for further analysis.
Six mice were recruited for each of the experimental
group. The study had been licensed according to Animal
(Control of Experiments) Ordinance Chapter 340 by the
Department of Health, Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region. (ref.: (11–632) in DH/HA&P/8/2/3 Pt. 31).

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
The plasma samples were diluted 800 times and the
medium for cell culture was without any dilution before
detection. The concentration of GPx3 was tested using
ELISA kit according to instruction manual (AdipoGen Inc,
Incheon, Korea).

In Vitro functional study
Cell culture, transfection and stable cell lines
Human liver cancer cell lines (HepG2, Hep3B
and Huh7) and human immortal liver cell lines (MIHA
and LO2) were purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). The
metastatic human liver cancer cell line MHCC97L was
obtained from the Liver Cancer institute and Zhongshan
Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, the People’s
Republic of China [39]. All the cell lines were cultured
as previously described [40]. The pcDNA 3.1 (+)
vector was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).
MHCC97L and Huh7 cells were transfected with
recombinant plasmid using lipofectamine 2000 Reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and cultured for two weeks
under G418 selection. Stable clones were maintained
in 0.05 mg/mL G418 for Huh7 cells and 0.5 mg/mL for
MHCC97L cells, respectively.

Nude mice orthotopic xenograft liver
cancer model
When the subcutaneous tumors grew and reached
6mm × 6mm in size, the animals were sacrificed by an
overdose intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital. The
tumor tissues were harvested and cut into 1–2mm3 cubes.
The tumor tissue cubes were then implanted into the left
liver lobes of another group of mice under anaesthesia as
described previously [41]. Five weeks after the tumor
implantation, the animals were sacrificed for samples
collection and further analysis. Eight mice were recruited in
each group. The study had been licensed according to Animal
(Control of Experiments) Ordinance Chapter 340 by the
Department of Health, Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region. (ref.: (11–632) in DH/HA&P/8/2/3 Pt. 31).

3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay and Colony formation assay
In order to explore the proliferation rate of HCC
cells, MTT and colony formation assay were performed
as previously described [40].

Mechanism study
EMT detection
In order to explore the mechanism of anti-invasiveness
of rGPx3, the role of rGPx3 in the EMT process was
detected. EMT of MHCC97L was pre-induced by TGF-β
in vitro and then treated with rGPx3. The epithelial and
mesenchymal markers were detected afterwards. Five
E-cadherin transcriptional repressors, Slug, Snail, SIP1,
Zeb1 and Twist, which were commonly involved in the EMT
process, were detected to identify which one was responsible
for the inhibitory effect of rGPx3 on EMT. Details were
listed in supplementary material.

Matrigel invasion assay
Around 5 × 104 cells were seeded into the upper
chamber (BD Biosciences) in 0.5 ml of serum-free
DMEM. In the meantime, the lower chamber was filled
up using DMEM with 10% FBS as a chemoattractant.
The cells were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for
24h for Huh7 and 48h for MHCC97L, respectively.
After that, cells left on the upper surface of the chamber
were removed gently using a cotton tip. Cells that had

Regulation of NFκB signaling pathway

hiPSC-MSC-GPx3 could hardly proliferate in the medium
of MHCC97L, the OD value of MTT assay mainly reflects
the proliferation of MHCC97L cells. In order to distinguish
two types of cells in co-culture system, MHCC97L
(1×104/well) was labeled with luciferin and co-cultured
with hiPSC-MSC-GPx3 (5×103/well). Proliferation of
MHCC97L in co-culture system was shown as luciferin
signal detected by Xenogen IVIS® in vivo imaging system.

In order to explore whether the suppressive effect
of rGPx3 on SIP1 was through inhibition of the NFκB
signaling pathway, the activation of NFκB in MHCC97L
was pre-induced by EGF and then treated with rGPx3.
The nuclear translocation of NFκB was observed by
immunoflorescence. To explore whether the downregulation of SIP1 could be directly regulated by the
NFκB signaling pathway, NFκB inhibitor (pyrrolidine
dithiocarbamate, PDTC, Sigma) was used. Details were
listed in supplementary material.

Investigation of tumor suppressive role of hiPSCMSC-GPx3 in vivo
The nude mice ectopic and orthotopic xenograft
liver cancer models were established as described in
section of in vivo functional study above. In the ectopic
xenograft liver cancer model, MHCC97L (2×106/100µL)
was co-injected with hiPSC-MSC-GPx3 (1×106/100µL)
subcutaneously into the right flank of nude mice.
Tumor size was measured every 5 days for 3 weeks. In
orthotopic xenograft liver cancer model, hiPSC-MSCGPx3 (1×106/100µL) was injected directly into the spleen
after implantation of a tumor nodule on the surface
of liver. Kinetic images of tumor growth in vivo were
captured by Xenogen IVIS® in vivo imaging system.
Migrated hiPSC-MSCs in tumor tissues were detected by
immuno-florescence (GFP) and IHC staining with antihuman fibroblast anti-body DIA100 (Dianova, Germany).
Expression of GPx3 was detected by IHC staining with
anti-human GPx3 anti-body (Abcam).

Regulation of Erk signaling pathway
In order to investigate whether the inhibitory effect
of rGPx3 on NFκB was through inhibition of Erk pathway,
the activation of Erk was pre-induced in MHCC97L by
EGF in vitro and then treated with rGPx3. To explore
whether activation of NFκB could be directly regulated
by Erk signaling pathway, Erk inhibitor (U0126) was used.
Details were listed in supplementary material.
Regulation of MKP3 expression
In order to explore whether inhibitory effect of
rGPx3 on Erk activation was through regulation of
MKP3, expression of MKP3 were detected in MHCC97L
after rGPx3 administration. To explore whether MKP3
expression was regulated by ROS levels, different
concentrations of H2O2 administration were applied.
Details were listed in supplementary material.

Statistical analysis

Translational study

The Chi-square test was used to compare categorical
data. The T test was adopted to compare continuous
variables. For mRNA level of GPx3 within tissues,
2-fold difference was selected as cut-off point by which
the patients could be segregated most evenly. Other
cutoff points had also been taken into consideration and
investigated. They showed the similar clinical implication.
For plasma GPx3, The Youden index [42] was used to
determine the optimal cutoff point for the prediction of
five year recurrence. The cutoff point with the maximized
Youden index showed the most optimal sensitivity and
specificity for prediction. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
was performed to compare the survival outcome of HCC
patients. The significant difference between survival
outcomes was detected by the log–rank test. The Cox
proportional hazard regression model was used to identify
predictors for overall survival. The variables were selected
into the final equation in multivariable analysis according
to forward stepwise selection procedure. P < 0.05 was
considered as statistically significant. Calculations were
made using SPSS computer software version 16 (SPSS
Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).

Establishment of engineered hiPSC-MSCs
delivering GPx3
A full-length human GPx3 gene was transduced
into expression plasmid pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-copGFP
(System Biosciences, SBI). Virus particles were packaged
in 293TN cells (System Biosciences, SBI). The hiPSCMSCs cell line was derived from our collaborator
Dr. Lian [23]. Expression of GPx3 after transduction was
confirmed by western-blot and Elisa. Stem cells’ property
was investigated after transduction using flow cytometry.
Antibodies of positive markers CD44-PE, CD105-PE,
CD90-PE and CD73-PE and negative markers CD34-PE
and CD45-PE were purchased from Biosciences (BD).
Investigation of tumor suppressive role
of hiPSC-MSC-GPx3 in vitro
The effect of hiPSC-MSC-GPx3 on the proliferation
of MHCC97L cells was examined by MTT assay.
MHCC97L was co-cultured with hiPSC-MSC-GPx3
at a different ratio for different time period. As
