ABSTRACT:
Triple Negative Breast Cancers (TNBC) is a heterogeneous disease at the
molecular and clinical level with poor outcome. Molecular subclassification of TNBCs
is essential for optimal use of current therapies and for development of new drugs.
microRNAs (miRNA) are widely recognized as key players in cancer progression
and drug resistance; investigation of their involvement in a TNBC cohort may reveal
biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of TNBC. Here we stratified a large TNBC
cohort into Core Basal (CB, EGFR and/or CK5, 6 positive) and five negative (5NP) if
all markers are negative. We determined the complete miRNA expression profile and
found a subset of miRNAs specifically deregulated in the two subclasses.
We identified a 4-miRNA signature given by miR-155, miR-493, miR-30e and miR27a expression levels, that allowed subdivision of TNBCs not only into CB and 5NP
subgroups (sensitivity 0.75 and specificity 0.56; AUC=0.74) but also into high risk
and low risk groups. We tested the diagnostic and prognostic performances of both
the 5 IHC marker panel and the 4-miRNA expression signatures, which clearly identify
worse outcome patients in the treated and untreated subcohorts. Both signatures
have diagnostic and prognostic value, predicting outcomes of patient treatment with
the two most commonly used chemotherapy regimens in TNBC: anthracycline or
anthracycline plus taxanes. Further investigation of the patients’ overall survival
treated with these regimens show that regardless of IHC group subdivision, taxanes
addition did not benefit patients, possibly due to miRNA driven taxanes resistance.
TNBC subclassification based on the 5 IHC markers and on the miR-155, miR-493,
miR-30e, miR-27a expression levels are powerful diagnostic tools. Treatment choice
and new drug development should consider this new subtyping and miRNA expression
signature in planning low toxicity, maximum efficacy therapies.

INTRODUCTION

influencing diverse biological processes [10, 11] through
effects of individual miRNAs on translation of multiple
mRNAs. We previously determined miRNA expression
profiles and expression profiles of a cancer-focused mRNA
panel, in breast cancers, adjacent non-tumor (normal) and
lymph node metastatic lesion (mets) tissues, from 173
women with TNBCs; we then linked specific miRNA
signatures to patient survival and used miRNA/mRNA
anti-correlations to identify clinically and genetically
different TNBC subclasses.
For the current study we stratified the TNBC
cohort based on EGFR and CK5/6 scoring, into CB
and 5NP subgroups and determined if there is a subset
of miRNAs specifically deregulated in one or the other
of the two subclasses. We indeed found a four miRNA
signature which allowed subdivision of TNBCs into two
subgroups (high risk and low risk) for which associations
among specific clinical features and the four miRNAs
were then sought, including outcomes based on specific
chemotherapy regimens.
The role of specific chemotherapy agents in the
treatment of TNBC remains incompletely defined. Taxanes
and anthracyclines are active in TNBC and remain
important agents, but have not shown specific benefit for
TNBC patients vs non-TNBC [12, 13]. Although TNBC is
associated with a poor prognosis, some patients respond
well to anthracycline-based chemotherapy, reflecting a
significant degree of molecular heterogeneity within this
subgroup [14-16].
Thus, we have examined and compared the
prognostic value of the IHC based subclassification in CB
and 5NP and of a four miRNA signature efficacy relative
to specific chemotherapy regimens.

Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), defined by
the absence of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor,
and HER-2 expression, account for 12% to 24% of
all breast cancers. TNBCs are associated with early
recurrence of disease and poor outcome.
Through gene expression profiling, six different
TNBC subtypes, defined by abrogation of signaling
pathways, have been identified: basal-like 1 and 2
(BL1 and BL2), immunomodulatory, mesenchymal,
mesenchymal stem-like, and luminal androgen receptorexpressing [1]. These molecular entities have shown
significant differences in terms of incidence, risk factors,
prognosis and response to treatment [1-3].
Approximately 15% of breast cancers are basallike and are associated with poor relapse-free and overall
survival [4-6]. The basal-like subtype is of particular
clinical interest due to its high frequency, lack of effective
targeted therapies, poor baseline prognosis, and tendency
to affect younger women. Over the years, basal-like breast
cancer has become commonly known as triple-negative
breast cancer (TNBC), lacking estrogen receptor (ER) and
progesterone receptor (PR) expression as well as human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification;
however, not all TNBCs are identified as basal-like by
gene expression, and not all basal-like tumors are Triple
Negative (TN) [7]. Subclassification is necessary to
better identify molecular-based therapeutic targets, select
biomarkers, discover new drugs, and design clinical trials
that will enable alignment of TNBC patients to appropriate
targeted therapies. Cost and complexity issues can render
gene expression profiling impractical as a routine hospital
diagnostic tool, while immunohistochemical (IHC) marker
detection is feasible for the majority of institutions.
Nielsen et al (2004) [8] and Carey et al (2006) [9]
showed that detection of epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) and/or cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6) expression by
IHC staining can accurately identify the basal-like tumors
among cohorts profiled by expression microarray with
100% specificity and 76% sensitivity [6]. This ‘‘fivemarker panel’’ ER-PR-HER2–EGFR-CK5/6 allows
subclassification of TNBCs as basal-like (or Core Basal,
CB) when EGFR and/or CK5/6 are positive or five
negative (5NP) if all markers are negative. In our current
study, we have correlated the 5 marker (ER-PR-HER2EGFR-CK5/6) IHC expression profiles with microRNA
(miRNA) expression and generated a four-miRNA
prognostic signature that stratifies with high specificity CB
and 5NP by overall survival. We also have correlated the
miRNA signature with prognosis and survival following
treatment with different chemotherapy regimens.
MiRNAs are 19–25 nucleotide, non-coding RNAs
that reduce the abundance and translational efficiency of
mRNAs and play a major role in regulatory networks,

RESULTS
Definition of triple negative breast cancer
biological subtypes by immunohistochemistry
Two TMAs comprehensive of the TNBC cohort
profiled for miRNA expression [17] were evaluated by
immunohistochemical analysis to assess the expression
of ER, PR, HER2, EGFR, and CK5/6. FISH analysis
for the HER2 gene was also performed, with no gene
amplification observed in all the tested cases.Cases
were categorized based on their IHC profiles into two
subclasses: (I) triple-negative cancers (i.e. ER-PR-HER2
negative) expressing EGFR and/or CK5/6, here referred
to as CB, the so called “basal-like” as defined by mRNA
expression analysis; and (II) cancers negative for the five
markers, referred to as the 5NP subclass, triple negative
cancers that express neither EGFR nor CK5/6, or “non
basal” if considering the definition by mRNA expression.

Of the 160 TNBCs considered, 82 were negative for
EGFR (51%), and 131 for CK5/6 (82%). A total of 92
cases (57.5%) were classified as CB, and 68 (42.5%)
as 5NP. The clinico-pathological characteristics of the
entire TNBC cohort, as well as of the two subclasses, are
summarized in Table 1.

CI=1.04-2.92; p=0.03) (Figure 1B). Upregulation of
miR-155 (HR=0.73; 95% CI=0.57–0.92) and of miR-493
(HR=0.88; 95% CI=0.72–0.99) correlated with better
patient outcome so were defined as “protective”; downregulation of miR-30e (HR=1.08; 95% CI=1.03–1.79)
and of miR-27a (HR=1.09; 95% CI=1.03–1.79, correlated
with a worse outcome so were defined as “risk”-associated
(Supplementary Table 2).Cox proportional hazards models
were applied to find, significant associations of the four
deregulated miRNAs with CB and 5NP patient outcomes.
All tumors were classified into high- or low-risk groups
according to their risk-score (see Materials and Methods).
The Kaplan-Meier overall survival (OS) graph, according
to the combined four deregulated miRNAs is shown
in Figure 1C. The median OS for the high vs low risk
miRNA signature were 75.5 vs 82 months (HR=2.46;
95% CI=1.43-4.12; p=0.001), indicating a significant
association between expression of the miRNAs and OS.

miRNA expression profiles of the CB and 5NP
subclasses identifies a diagnostic four miRNA
signature
To identify diagnostic miRNA signatures in
TNBCs, miRNA expression profiles already analyzed
for TNBC expression pattern (Supplementary Figure 1),
were examined to find differently deregulated miRNAs
among CB and 5NP tumors.Supervised clustering of
the cohort based on the IHC results (Figure 1A) shows
a signature of four miRNAs that performed best in
differentiating between CB and 5NP cancers (Figure
1A and Supplementary Table 1): miR-155 (logFC 0.76;
p=0.04), miR-493 (logFC 0.54; p=0.01), miR-30e (logFC
-0.61; p=0.04), and miR-27a (logFC -0.80; p=0.01). This
four miRNA signature displayed sensitivity 0.75 and
specificity 0.56 (AUC=0.74) in subclassifying CB or 5NP.

Prognostic impact of TNBC subtype classification
dependent on specific therapy regimens
Since CB and 5NP subclasses have distinct OS
as well high/low risk miRNA signature-based, we
next analyzed the correlations among: subclasses,
chemotherapy regimens and outcome.In the 107
patients that received chemotherapy, the CB group had
significantly worse OS compared to the 5NP group
(HR=2.46; 95% CI = 1.25-4.25; p=0.008) (Figure 2A). A

miRNA signature impacts survival of TNBCs
Based on IHC subtyping, CB cancers exhibited a
significantly worse outcome than 5NP (HR=1.76; 95%

similar trend was observed when stratifying the TNBCs
for high and low risk by the miRNA signature (Figure 2B),
the high-risk subgroup having a lower OS compared to the
low-risk group (HR=1.98; 95% CI = 1.04-3.74; p=0.04).
In patients not undergoing chemotherapy, both
IHC and four miRNA signature subtyping significantly
stratified patients in prognostic classes (Figures 2C and
2D). 5NP untreated patients showed a better outcome
compared to the untreated CB group (HR=2.97;
95% CI=1-8.87; p=0.05). The four miRNA signature
subclassification performed better in discriminating
high risk patients in comparison to the IHC subtyping
(HR=6.19; 95% CI = 2.45-32.16; p=0.001).If the group
of patients for whom chemotherapy treatment information
was not available (NA) are stratified according to IHC
status there is a clear trend toward worse survival of the
CB subtype (Supplementary Figure 2A); also the four
miRNA predictor can even more clearly separate this
cohort into high/low risk cancers (HR=4.07; 95% CI =
1.44-9.75; p=0.007) (Supplementary Figure 2B).
TNBC patients are usually treated with a regimen
of anthracycline or anthracycline plus taxanes, regardless
of their proven intrinsic heterogeneity or IHC status. As
shown in Table 1, within the entire TNBC cohort, four
main chemotherapeutic regimens were administered: 1anthracycline containing regimen (primarily doxorubicin
and cyclophosphamide [AC], fluorouracil, epirubicin,
cyclophosphamide [FEC]); 2- anthracycline + taxanes

(AC+ taxol or taxotere); 3- non-anthracycline, no taxane
containing regimen (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate,
fluorouracil [CMF]); 4- taxane alone or in combination
with non-anthracyline drugs (primarly taxol alone).
Among the 92 CB TNBC patients, 11 received
no chemotherapy, 38 were treated with anthracyclinebased chemotherapy (13 primarily with doxorubicin/
cyclophosphamide and 25 with doxorubicin, taxol,
taxotere) and 9 were treated with non-anthracycline-based
chemotherapy (6 with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate,
fluorouracil and 3 taxane or taxanes). Among the 68
5NP TNBC patients, 11 received no adjuvant systemic
therapy, 15 received anthracycline-based chemotherapy
(6 primarily doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide and 9
doxorubicin, taxol, taxotere), and 2 received nonanthracycline-based chemotherapy (Table 1).
We stratified the cohort into the CB and 5NP
subclasses and then considered anthracycline containing
regimen vs untreated patients (Figure 3A). Besides the not
unexpected positive effect of the chemotherapy in both
subclasses, it is observed that the untreated 5NP group
showed longer life expectancy than the chemotherapy
treated CB group (p=0.027). This finding underlines
the much better prognosis of the 5NP vs the CB cancers
regardless of chemotherapy, as well as the lower efficacy
of this therapy for the 5NP group. The high/low risk
miRNA signature overall survival shown in Figure 3B
is comparable to the IHC-based (Figure 3A), where the

anthracycline-containing regimen significantly influenced
the prognosis of high-risk tumors (p<0.001). On the other
hand, there is little if any effect of the anthracyclinecontaining regimen in the low risk patient group.
Considering that anthracycline-containing regimen
results in the best outcome regardless of stratification by
IHC or high/low miRNA signature status (data not shown)
we proceeded with the investigation of anthracycline plus
taxanes Regimen 2. Conflicting data have been reported
on the specific benefit of taxanes for adjuvant therapy
in TNBC. The analysis of our cohort gave interesting
results for consideration. Regardless of the IHC status,
the addition of taxanes apparently does not improve OS,
and may worsen the prognosis (Figure 3C). Because the
number of patients treated within the Regimen 2 was too
small (34 CB vs 9 5NP) to have a solid statistics about the
IHC and miRNA signature performances, we considered
different possible scenarios about this observation. The
intriguing finding concerning the efficacy of taxanes can
be explained by investigating the expression of Vimentin,
a protein that has been linked to taxanes resistance
in breast cancer and considered a marker for adverse
prognosis [18-21]. We evaluated Vimentin expression
by IHC in the whole cohort and we found that was upregulated in CB tumors (CB, 43.5% positive; 5NP, 27.9%
positive; p=0.044); this is in accordance with several

studies that correlate Vimentin upregulation with taxanes
resistance and worst patient prognosis.
Another possible scenario is that Regimen 2 treated
patients might present a higher population of breast
cancer stem cells (BCSCs) identified by the cell-surface
markers CD44+/CD24−/low which demonstrate chemo- and
radiotherapy resistance [22-24]. From a first analysis of
CD44+/CD24−/low protein stain on the associated TMA
of the cohort, we couldn’t find any correlation between
increased expression of these markers and Regimen 1 and
Regimen 2 patients overall survival. More investigations
of these findings will be the aim of future works when a
custom made mRNA panel of genes will be run and more
proteins will be stained in the associated TMA.
Overall these data clearly show how expression
levels of miR-155, miR-493, miR-30e, miR-27a the
4 miRNAs belonging to the miRNAs signature, taken
together, can serve as new diagnostic and prognostic
factors in TNBC.

DISCUSSION
Triple negative tumors exhibit a more aggressive
phenotype and a worse clinical prognosis compared to
other breast cancer subtypes. Only 30% of women with
metastatic TNBC survive 5 years, and many patients

eventually die of their disease. This is mainly determined
by the high heterogeneity within these tumors and lack of
definitive TNBC-specific therapeutic targets [2].Several
studies have investigated the heterogeneity of TNBC
from the molecular point of view. Cheang and colleagues
first reported a significantly poorer survival in CB tumors
compared to the 5NP subtype [2]. However, conflicting
data have been reported [25, 26]. In this context, our group
recently demonstrated that specific miRNA expression
signatures characterize and contribute to the phenotypic
diversity of TNBC. Moreover, miRNA expression profiles
define different prognostic classes among TNBC patients
[17].
Our current results further emphasize that the TNBC
subtype includes distinctive cancer subtypes. In a series
of 173 TNBCs, we tested the prognostic performances
of both the 5 IHC markers panel and miRNA expression
signatures. As reported previously by others [2, 3] we
observed a poorer prognosis in CB patients in comparison
to the 5NP group. Based on deregulated miRNA levels
differentially expressed in the two different TNBC
subtypes, a four miRNA signature (miR-155, miR-493,
miR-30e, and miR-27a) was generated. This signature
could discriminate among patients with high and low
risk prognoses. As expected, low-risk tumors were highly
enriched in 5NP samples.MiRNA profiling methods have
been shown to be standardizable and of clinical impact
in human cancers, even starting from routinely processed
specimens. Moreover, miRNA expression profiling has
been shown to be feasible and reliable also in cytological
smears, the most common and least invasive method for
breast cancer diagnosis. Altogether, such characteristics
suggest miRNAs as suitable biomarkers to be introduced
into clinical practice.
We identified a signature of four miRNAs that have
been implicated in breast carcinogenesis. In particular,
miR-27a and miR-155 deregulation has been demonstrated
to significantly impact prognosis of breast cancer patients.
miR-27a indirectly regulates ER-alpha and hormone
responsiveness in breast cancer-derived cell lines [27].
Moreover, it determines endothelial differentiation
of breast cancer stem cells, promoting tumor neoangiogenesis. Recently, miR-27a has been proposed as
a novel marker of breast cancer progression and worse
prognosis [28], which is in line with the observed upregulation in CB samples in our series.
miR-155 has been implicated in tumor
aggressiveness and resistance to chemotherapy in
vitro and in vivo; its oncogenic role in leukemia and
colon cancer has been previously established [29, 30].
Moreover, this miRNA has been confirmed as a novel
plasma circulating biomarker of metastatic disease [31].
In TNBC, contrasting results have been produced [17, 32,
33]. In our series, miR-155 is significantly down-regulated
in CB tumors, further supporting our seminal finding of its
“protective” role in TNBC patients. How miR-155 exerts
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

this caretaker role in TNBC is still under investigation and
will be subject of future publications, we can anticipate
that seems to be strictly correlated to the crucial role of
DNA damage pathways in TNBC.
TNBC-specific targeted therapies remain undefined,
and the most widespread approved therapeutic regimens
are based on combinations of an anthracycline, a taxane,
and/or an alkylating agent (typically cyclophosphamide)
[12, 13, 34]. No validated biomarker is available to
select patients with the highest benefit from the use of
anthracycline, so far. In our series, CB subtype and highrisk patients (miRNA signature defined) had a better
relative response to anthracycline-based therapies in
comparison to 5NP, maybe due to the more aggressive
molecular phenotype of the disease [35-37]. Our finding
show the much better prognosis of the 5NP vs the CB
cancers regardless of chemotherapy, as well as the lower
efficacy of this therapy for the 5NP group; this subgroup
need a much better targeted chemotherapy to increase
overall survival.
Since patients treated with anthracycline alone
had the best outcome compared to the combination
of anthracycline + taxanes, we investigated possible
taxanes chemoresistance pathways driven by miRNAgene deregulation. Unfortunately the miRNA profile
comparison between CB vs 5NP patients treated with
Regimen 2 only due to the low cardinality of subcohort
doesn’t give statistically significant p-values (data not
shown). Still, the interesting data about the lower overall
survival of anthracycline + taxanes treated patients can be
interpreted in different scenarios regardless of the group
subdivision.
It is know that administration of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy to breast cancer patients increases the
fraction of CD44+/CD24−/low tumor cells [38]. Connecting
the deregulation of the BCSCs markers (CD44, CD24) to
a possible selection of a more aggressive cancer phenotype
[22, 24] by the chemotherapy Regimen 2, basically
by the addition of taxanes, is an appealing scenario.
Unfortunately in our cohort CD44+/CD24−/low IHC data
were available only for 6 cases treated with Regimen
1 and only for 4 patients treated with Regimen 2; these
small numbers cannot give any trustworthy statistic or
show any significant trend toward the involvement of
BCSCs resistance in the observed inefficacy of the taxanes
addition to the anthracycline regimen.
But if we consider only the CD44+/CD24−/low
patients and we stratified them in CB and 5NP, based on
the status of the five IHC markers the overall survival
curves are basically overlapping (Supplementary Figure
5A, p value is not statistically significant); while if we
stratify those patients by miR-155, miR-493, miR-30e,
miR- 27a expression levels, although again not statistically
significant, the signature can divide the CD44+/CD24−/
low
patients in high/low risk subgroups (Supplementary
Figure 5B); opening to many different scenarios driven by

miRNA deregulation.
Future development of this project will include the
analysis of a custom made mRNA panel and more proteins
assessment on the TMA. The detection of angiogenic
factors and EMT/MET proteins known to be involved in
the BCSC driven chemotherapy [24, 39] will hopefully
help to clarify the involvement of BCSCs in TNBC.
The data shown so far support the conclusion that
miRNAs are implicated in chemoresistance processes in
breast cancers.
We can also analyze the contribution of non-stem
cancer cells to the lower overall survival of Regimen 2
treated patients, focusing on miRNA targeted proteins.
Of interest, taxanes-resistant cells display hallmarks of
mesenchymal phenotype, including increased vimentin
expression; its aberrant expression during EMT is
suggested to be an essential element for epithelial
plasticity and tumor cell metastasis [40, 41]. We can
speculate that the worse outcome of CB cases treated
with anthracycline + taxanes regimen can be due to the
down-regulation of miR-30a (CB mean expression= 8.22,
5NP mean expression= 8.41) which will lead to increased
vimentin expression in CB (CB, 43.5% positive versus
5NP, 27.9% positive p=0.044) which will induce taxane
resistance as previously reported by Cheang et al.
Further studies should clinically validate such
findings and test miR-30a impact on breast cancer
therapeutic outcome.
In conclusion, we showed the importance of TNBC
subclassification based on the 5 IHC markers method
proposed by Cheang et al [3] and on a novel four miRNAs
signature as new diagnostic tools. Both signatures have
prognostic value, predicting patient outcomes based on
different chemotherapy regimens. The development of
new TNBC-targeted drugs should consider targeting
the different TNBC subtypes as well as the miRNAderegulated signal pathways in order to maximize patient
outcome.

and pathologic specimens stored in Path Archives were
de-identified. 365 consecutive TN localized breast cancer
patients were identified from 1995-2005. After pathology
review for tumors with sufficient sample for study, 173
paraffin blocks for TNBCs were identified for preparation
of a tissue microarray and cores for RNA preparation, with
the characteristics shown in the demographics summary in
Table 1. For preparation of RNA, we used two 1.75 mm
cores for tumor and for normal and two 0.6 mm cores were
taken for preparation of the TMA in duplicate.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical reactions were obtained on
4 μm-thick sections and performed automatically (Dako
Autostainer immunostaining system; Dako). Sections were
then lightly counterstained with hematoxylin. Appropriate
positive and negative controls were run concurrently.
CK5/6 (D5/16 B4; Dako), EGFR (2-18C9; Dako) and
Vimentin (M0275; Dako) immunostaining was performed
on TMA sections.
The expression of CK5/6 and Vimentin was
cytoplasmic, whereas the expression of EGFR was both
cytoplasmic and membranous. Cytoplasmic expression in
≥10% of tumor cells for CK5/6, and membranous staining
in ≥10% of tumor cells for EGFR were accepted as
positive, as previously described. Expression of vimentin
was scored as follows: sections were scored from 0–3
where ‘0’ corresponds to lack of positive staining and
‘3’ represents the most intense staining. Scores were
calculated as follows: average intensity of the stain (1–
3) x average percentage of positive cells, as previously
described [42].
CD24 (SN3b; Neomarkers) and CD44 (DF1485;
Dako) expression was determined by double staining of
tumor cells [42, 43].
TNBCs were divided into subtypes of breast
cancer as defined by their IHC profiles as basal-like
triple negative (CB; negative for ER, PR, and HER-2 and
positive for CK5/6 and/or EGFR), and five negative (5NP;
negative for ER, PR, HER-2, CK5/6, and EGFR). Slides
were scored independently by two pathologists (GG, SB)
blinded to breast cancer subtype; one pathologist (MF)
converted scores to numbers, selected cutoff values for
each marker and entered data into Excel files.

METHODS
Patients
An IRB-approved OSU protocol (Cancer
Institutional Review Board of the Ohio State University)
for this research linked clinical features, treatment
and outcome data of breast cancer patients in the OSU
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) breast
cancer database/tumor registry with archival breast cancer
pathology specimens stored in the OSU Tissue Archive
Service using the Information Warehouse at OSUMC
to serve as “honest broker” and provided de-identified
clinic-pathological information. No consent was required

miRNA expression profiling and statistical
analysis
Total RNAs were processed with the nanoString
nCounter system (nanoString, Seattle, Washington, USA)
in the Nucleic Acid Shared Resource of The Ohio State
University. The miRNA panel detects 664 endogenous
miRNAs (with 654 probes), 82 putative viral miRNAs,
and 5 housekeeping transcripts. See Cascione et al [17]

for expanded methods and validation of the microarray
results.The miRNA microarray expression data have been
submitted to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset
with accession number GSE41970 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE41970).All
foldchanges associated with these analyses are represented
in log2 scale (logFC) and only data with a P-value
(corrected for multiple comparisons by the BenjaminiHochberg method) of ≤0.05 were considered significant.
Hazard ratios (HR) were computed for a 2-fold change in
the miRNA expression level. ‘Protective’ miRNAs were
defined as those associated with an HR (from univariate
Cox regression analysis) of less than one (HR<1); ‘riskassociated’ miRNAs were defined as those associated
with an HR greater than one (HR>1).We estimated patient
prognoses using Kaplan-Meier plots and the log-rank
test. To generate a risk score, we adopted a previously
developed strategy using the Cox regression coefficient
of each dysregulated miRNA among 5NP and CB. The
risk score for each patient was derived by multiplying
the expression level of a miRNA by its corresponding
coefficient. The patients were thus dichotomized into
groups at high or low risk using the 50th percentile
(median) cutoff of the risk score as the threshold value.

belonging to this independent cohort (20 samples),
the 5 markers IHC data were also available. We subtyped patients into CB and 5NP and to proceed with the
validation of the OS based on IHC and miRNA signature
status (Supplementary Figure S4). The diagnostic value of
the TNBC subtyping based on IHC and miRNA signature
was validated by OS as shown in Supplementary Figure
S4A and Supplementary Figure S4B.From analysis of
the dataset associated with this independent cohort,
the diagnostic value of both the signatures couldn’t be
validated due to the small number of events within the 20
samples (only 4).

ACKNOLEDGMENTS:
This work was supported by United States Public
Health Service, National Cancer Institute grants,
CA154200, CA120516, CA152758, and the Stefanie
Spielman Foundation for Breast Cancer Research. The
funders had no role in study design, data collection
and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the
manuscript. We would like to thank the Anne Wolf Breast
Cancer Research Foundation, for their support of our
microRNAs study.

To validate these study findings, three approaches
were used: first we validated the deregulated miRNAs
“in silico” using the database published by Farazi et al
2011 [44] [GEO: GSE28884]. From the analysis of this
database, based on an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx
deep sequencing platform, we were able to confirm the
expression pattern of the 69% of our miRNAs cohort
represented among the sequences.
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) [45] dataset,
also based on deep sequencing, was used for a second “in
silico” validation, here the expression pattern of the whole
miRNA profile was confirmed by the 73%.
In a subset of samples (randomly chosen based
on availability of RNAs) we were able to validate the
expression levels of a subset of miRNAs (7 differentially
expressed miRNAs shown in Supplementary Figure
S1, plus 2 miRNAs used as normalizers) by TaqMan®
qRT-PCR assay. Box plots representing this qRT-PCR
based validation are shown in Supplementary Figure
S3. Absence of undetermined values in the Real-Time
raw data (not shown) also indicates low levels of RNA
degradation, a concern when FFPE samples are involved.
An external TNBC cohort of 48 FFPE tissues was
considered. This second cohort was also profiled by the
nanoString nCounter method and the miRNA profiles were
analyzed following the criteria for the previous cohort;
results of study of this independent cohort confirmed the
deregulation of the 79% of the miRNAs observed to be
dysregulated in the current study.For a subset of samples
