Abstract
Eribulin (E7389), a mechanistically unique microtubule inhibitor in phase III clinical trials for cancer, exhibits
superior efficacy in vivo relative to the more potent compound ER-076349, a fact not explained by different
pharmacokinetic properties. A cell-based pharmacodynamic explanation was suggested by observations that
mitotic blockade induced by eribulin, but not ER-076349, is irreversible as measured by a flow cytometric mitotic
block reversibility assay employing full dose/response treatment. Cell viability 5 days after drug washout
established relationships between mitotic block reversibility and long-term cell survival. Similar results occurred
in U937, Jurkat, HL-60, and HeLa cells, ruling out cell type–specific effects. Studies with other tubulin agents
suggest that mitotic block reversibility is a quantifiable, compound-specific characteristic of antimitotic agents
in general. Bcl-2 phosphorylation patterns parallel eribulin and ER-076349 mitotic block reversibility patterns,
suggesting persistent Bcl-2 phosphorylation contributes to long-term cell-viability loss after eribulin's irreversible blockade. Drug uptake and washout/retention studies show that [3H]eribulin accumulates to lower
intracellular levels than [3H]ER-076349, yet is retained longer and at higher levels. Similar findings occurred with
irreversible vincristine and reversible vinblastine, pointing to persistent cellular retention as a component of
irreversibility. Our results suggest that eribulin's in vivo superiority derives from its ability to induce irreversible
mitotic blockade, which appears related to persistent drug retention and sustained Bcl-2 phosphorylation. More
broadly, our results suggest that compound-specific reversibility characteristics of antimitotic agents contribute
to interactions between cell-based pharmacodynamics and in vivo pharmacokinetics that define antitumor
efficacy under intermittent dosing conditions. Cancer Res; 71(2); 496–505. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Halichondrin B (HB) is a structurally complex marine
natural product (1, 2). Although HB's potent anticancer activity (2–4) led to interest by the U.S. National Cancer Institute in
developing it as a novel chemotherapeutic, supply of HB from
aquaculture prevented such efforts (5). Fortunately, HB's

synthesis in 1992 by Kishi and colleagues (6–8), together with
discovery that its activity resides in its macrocyclic C1-C38
moiety (Towle MJ, Kishi Y, Littlefield BA, original unpublished
data, Eisai Research Institute, 1992; refs. 5, 7, 9, 10), provided
both a renewable material source and allowed simplification
and optimization. More than 200 analogues of HB's C1-C38
moiety were made (5), culminating in discovery of 2 promising
analogues, C35-hydroxyl ER-076349 (NSC-707390) and C35amine eribulin [NSC-707389 (previous nomenclature includes
ER-086526, E7389); ref. 10; Fig. 1]. Eribulin is in phase III
clinical trials for advanced metastatic breast cancer and in
phase II trials for other cancer types. Clinically, eribulin is
administered using intermittent dosing (typically, days 1 and 8
of a 21-day cycle; see www.clinicaltrials.gov for further information), consistent with preclinical indications that it is
maximally efficacious when dosed intermittently (11).
Eribulin works via apoptosis-inducing, microtubule-targeting antimitotic mechanisms (10, 12) involving inhibition of
microtubule dynamics by mechanisms distinct from most
other tubulin-targeting agents (13–15). Eribulin's mechanistic
novelty is noteworthy when considering the original mechanistic studies on HB, which showed it to have a spectrum of
biochemical effects on tubulin that was distinct from other

tubulin-targeted drugs (16). Thus, HB's mechanistic novelty
has been preserved in eribulin.
While selecting between ER-076349 and eribulin as a final
candidate, we noted that although both compounds showed
sub-to-low nmol/L growth inhibitory potencies, similar abilities to disrupt mitotic spindles and induce mitotic blockade, similar susceptibilities to P-glycoprotein–mediated
efflux, and similar in vivo pharmacokinetic properties (10,
17), eribulin was consistently superior in vivo against human
tumor xenografts even though ER-076349 is somewhat more
potent (10). Insights into this came from cell cycle analyses
following drug treatment and washout, which revealed that
mitotic blockade by eribulin was irreversible after drug
washout, whereas ER-076349's blockade was reversible (5,
17). Although differences in mitotic block reversibility would
be inconsequential under continuous exposure conditions in
typical cell growth inhibition assays, we hypothesized that
they might have considerable impact on in vivo efficacy
under intermittent dosing conditions in preclinical xenograft models.
Here we present a cell-based assay allowing quantification
of mitotic block reversibility of antimitotic agents under drug
treatment and washout conditions. This assay was designed to
be an in vitro cell-based surrogate for effects of intermittent
dosing in vivo. Using eribulin and ER-076349, we explored
relationships between mitotic block reversibility, long-term
cell viability, inactivation of Bcl-2 and cellular uptake, and
retention of radiolabeled probes. Our results provide a plausible explanation for the in vivo superiority of eribulin relative
to the more potent ER-076349. More generally, our results
argue for consideration of cell-based pharmacodynamics

alongside in vivo pharmacokinetics when evaluating the efficacy of antimitotic drugs administered under intermittent
dosing conditions.

Materials and Methods
Compounds and synthesis
Structures of HB, eribulin and ER-076349 are presented in
Fig. 1. Eribulin and ER-076349 were synthesized as described
(18). Radiolabeling was via regioselective palladium-catalyzed H-T exchange with tritium gas (Lewis BM et al., in
preparation; specific activities: [3H]eribulin, 29 Ci/mmol;
[3H]ER-076349, 30 Ci/mmol). In principle, tritiation could
have occurred at either C19 or C26 olefins, but precedent for
C19 regioselectivity had been established by earlier work on
terminal olefins using metathesis (19). [3H]Vinblastine sulfate (11.4 Ci/mmol) and [3H]vincristine sulfate (7.4 Ci/mmol)
were from Amersham International. Results of studies using
[3H]vinblastine and [3H]vincristine were corrected for
approximately 1.5-fold difference in specific activities. Corrections for [3H]eribulin and [3H]ER-076349 were not made
because their specific activities differed by approximately
only 3%.
Cells and cell culture
Cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) and grown under ATCC-recommended
conditions. U-937 histiocytic lymphoma cells, HL-60 acute
promyelocytic leukemia cells, Jurkat acute T-cell leukemia
cells (clone E6–1), and HeLa S3 cells were obtained on 2/15/
1990, 7/29/1992, 4/29/1996, and 1/13/1997, respectively. All

lines were expanded on receipt and cryopreserved at lowest
possible passages using a 2-tiered system, to allow experiments to be done with cells that were never more than 20
passages from thaw, or more than 30 passages from receipt
from ATCC. DNA profile authentication of all 4 lines has been
reported by ATCC; additionally, ATCC reports cytogenetic
analyses and/or isoenzyme characterization for HeLa S3,
HL-60, and Jurkat cells. No further cell line authentication
was done beyond what was provided by ATCC.
Cell cycle analysis
Aliquots of cell suspensions taken at t ¼ 0 h and t ¼ 10 h in
the mitotic block reversibility assay were analyzed by flow
cytometry as previously described (10).
Mitotic block reversibility assay
Schematic representation of the mitotic block reversibility
assay is shown in Fig. 2. U-937 cells were plated in 22.5 mL
volumes in 75 cm2 flasks at 1  105 cell/mL and incubated
for 30 to 34 hours to allow resumption of log-phase growth
(optimal time for resuming log-phase growth determined
empirically). Test compounds were added as 2.5 mL of 10
concentrates yielding 0.1 to 1,000 nmol/L final concentrations (1–10,000 nmol/L used for colchicine, colcemid, nocodazole due to lower intrinsic growth inhibitory potencies) in
half-log increments; compound-free plates received 2.5 mL
of vehicle control. This time point, designated t ¼ 12 h,
marked the beginning of the 12-hour pretreatment period;
previous studies had shown that 12-hour exposure of U-937
cells to antimitotic agents provides optimal balance between
full collection of cells in G2/M and minimal apoptosis
induction (10, 12). At t ¼ 0 h, cells were harvested and
washed twice with 50 mL prewarmed, pre-5% CO2 equilibrated, compound-free media using centrifugation at
300  g for 10 minutes, followed by resuspension in
35 mL of the same media; 10 mL aliquots were immediately
taken for cell cycle evaluation, with the remaining 25 mL
returned to fresh flasks for 10-hour incubation in compound-free media. At t ¼ 10 h, 10 mL aliquots were taken
from flasks for cell cycle evaluation, with immediate replenishment using 10 mL of fresh, prewarmed, compound-free

media. Remaining cells were incubated for 5 days, with one
80% media replenishment after 48 hours to prevent nutrient
depletion. After 5 days, cell viabilities were determined by
standard trypan blue exclusion techniques. The 5-day postwashout recovery time was empirically selected for maximal
amplification and overgrowth of remaining living cells, thus
providing clear demarcation of long-term cell killing effects
following transient exposure to test agents.
The timing of each step of the U-937 mitotic block
reversibility assay was empirically determined on the basis
of thorough investigation of cell cycle phase lengths with
and without cell synchronization. We had previously determined that the most accurate way of measuring mitotic
completion was not by quantifying loss of cells from G2/M,
but rather by measuring cells in the G1 phase at any given
time, for the following reasons. Previous studies with bromodeoxyuridine pulse-labeling established G1 phase length
in log-phase U-937 cells to be approximately 8 hours (Supplementary Fig. S1). In addition, mitotic synchrony studies of
U-937 cells using the highly reversible mitotic blocker nocodazole indicated that after nocodazole release, progression
of cells through mitosis and into the G1 phase was complete
by 10 hours. Cells measured in the G1 peak thus represented
cells that had completed mitosis during the previous 10
hours (Supplementary Fig. S2). The G1 peak method of
measuring mitotic completion was found to be superior
to quantifying decreases in the G2/M peak itself; this method
was thus selected for quantifying mitotic completion in the
mitotic block reversibility assay. On the basis of analysis of
289 mitotic block reversibility assays, a complete mitotic
block (CMB) is considered one in which no more than
approximately 1% of cells are present in the G1 phase
(steady-state proportion of G1 cells in log-phase U-937
populations is approximately 40%–45%; Fig. 4). Mitotic block
reversibility ratios were calculated by dividing the minimum
drug concentration required to maintain CMB at t ¼ 10 h by
the minimum concentration required to initially induce
CMB at t ¼ 0 h.
The mitotic block reversibility assay involves numerous
handling steps (add compounds, perform washouts, take
aliquots, etc.) that have the potential to cause decreases in

media temperature and CO2 saturation levels that can slow
cell cycle progression through different phases, markedly
degrading data quality. In our experience, successful use of
this assay depends on starting with log-phase cells, working
fast at each step, using prewarmed media for washing, minimizing cap opening times and times outside of incubators,
and not opening incubator doors during incubations.
Attempts to reduce the assay scale from 75 cm2 flasks to
25 cm2 flasks consistently led to degradation of data quality,
an observation we attribute to accelerated loss of temperature
stability and CO2 equilibrium with smaller flasks and media
volumes.

Bcl-2 phosphorylation
Cell aliquots were obtained at t ¼ 0 h and t ¼ 10 h during
the mitotic block reversibility assay. Lysates were prepared
in 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% (v/v)
NP40, 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol, 1 mmol/L sodium vanadate,
50 mmol/L sodium fluoride, 40 mmol/L b-glycerol phosphate, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease
inhibitors (diluted 1:500; Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set III,
Calbiochem). Proteins were analyzed using 12.5% SDS-PAGE
gels followed by immunoblotting with anti–Bcl-2 monoclonal antibody (Dako #M0887) and horseradish peroxidaseconjugated sheep antimouse IgG as secondary antibody
(Amersham #931) to detect Bcl-2 as a 26-kDa band. Phosphorylated Bcl-2 tracks slightly higher (slower) than the
unphosphorylated species.
Cellular uptake and washout/retention studies
Evaluation of [3H]eribulin, [3H]ER-076349, [3H]vincristine,
and [3H]vinblastine uptake and washout/retention in U-937
cells was done as follows. Tritiated compounds were added to
sterile 1.5 mL screw cap microcentrifuge tubes and air dried to
remove solvent. After compound resuspension in 100 mL cell
culture medium, 22.2  106 cells were added in 0.9 mL
complete culture medium (including fetal bovine serum,
glutamine, and antibiotics). Incubations were at 37 C with
frequent vortexing. Compound uptake as a function of drug
concentration was determined after 60 minutes, the empirically determined minimum time needed to reach maximal
radioactivity uptake. Cell-associated radioactivity was determined as follows. Triplicate 25-mL samples of cells were
removed and layered on top of 300 mL ice-cold 20% sucrose
in 400 mL Sarstedt tubes, followed by centrifugation at
8,500  g for 1 minute to separate cells from labeled media
and to wash cells during centrifugal transit through the
sucrose. Tubes with pelleted cells were immediately frozen
in a dry ice/ethanol bath. Bottom portions of the still-frozen
tubes containing pellets were immediately cut off directly into
scintillation vials, followed by addition of scintillation fluid
and radioactivity counting (Beckman LS 6000 counter).
Because of unexpectedly large differences in cellular uptake
between the paired drugs (Fig. 6), different preloading concentrations were used for washout/retention studies to start
with equal intracellular drug levels (dashed lines, Fig. 6A and
B). Thus, preloading concentrations for washout/retention
studies used 800 nmol/L [3H]eribulin versus 100 nmol/L

Compound retention after 60-minute preloading was measured after rapid 1:50 dilution of labeled cells into prewarmed,
compound-free complete media followed by incubation at
37 C with agitation. Five replicate 75-mL samples were
removed, layered on and centrifuged through sucrose as
above, and processed for counting immediately after dilution
(0 time) and at intervals over a 3-hour period. Percent residual
cell-associated radioactivity was determined by dividing mean
counts at each time point by mean counts seen at 0 time.
Control studies indicated there was no measurable loss of cellassociated radioactivity during the very brief time required for
dilution and initial sampling.

with minimum concentrations needed to induce CMB (0
hours) or sustain CMB after washout (10 hours) being
circled. Eribulin and ER-076349 showed significant differences in their abilities to induce mitotic blockade that
remained intact 10 hours postwashout. Importantly, such
differences are only apparent when mitotic block reversibility is measured with full dose/response titrations, because
sufficiently high concentrations of both compounds can
induce irreversible mitotic blockade (30 nmol/L ER076349, 10 nmol/L eribulin). CMBs at 0 hour were initially
induced by 3 nmol/L ER-076349 and 10 nmol/L eribulin,
consistent with ER-076349's greater cell growth inhibitory
potency (10). For ER-076349, 10-fold higher concentration
(30 nmol/L) was required to sustain CMB 10 hours postwashout, indicating that ER-076349 induces moderately
reversible mitotic blockade (reversibility ratio: 30 nmol/L/
3 nmol/L ¼ 10). In contrast, CMB initially induced by 10
nmol/L eribulin remained intact 10 hours postwashout,
indicating that eribulin induces irreversible mitotic blockade (reversibility ratio: 10 nmol/L/10 nmol/L ¼ 1).
Figure 4 shows average mitotic completion and 5-day cellviability data for ER-076349 and eribulin from multiple
assays. On average, CMB was initially induced by 3 nmol/L
ER-076349, yet 30 nmol/L was required to maintain postwashout CMB. In contrast, 10 nmol/L eribulin was sufficient
to both initially induce CMB and maintain CMB after
washout. Thus, averaged data from many experiments establish ER-076349 as a moderately reversible antimitotic agent
(reversibility ratio: 35 nmol/L/3 nmol/L ¼ 12), whereas
eribulin is an irreversible antimitotic agent (reversibility
ratio: 11 nmol/L/11 nmol/L ¼ 1). Importantly, 5-day cell
viabilities tracked not with initial 0 hour CMB, but rather
with sustained postwashout 10-hour CMB. Thus, for both
agents, concentrations that sustained postwashout CMB
were identical to those that led to complete viability loss
5 days later.

Cancer Res; 71(2) January 15, 2011

Interestingly, ER-076349 showed reproducible postwashout
(10 hours) rebound of mitotic completion with maximum at 3
nmol/L (Fig. 4, left), exactly corresponding to the lowest
concentration that induced CMB at 0 hour. Because ER076349–induced blockade is reversible at this concentration,
the rebound probably represents synchronous progression of
cells through mitosis after recovery from reversible blockade.
Rebound is not seen with irreversible eribulin (Fig. 4, right).
Thus, cells can be synchronized in mitosis within a narrow 10fold window using ER-076349, but this is not possible with
eribulin.
To rule out cell type-specific effects, mitotic block reversibility studies were done in Jurkat acute T cell leukemia, HL-60
promyelocytic leukemia and HeLa cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Results from all 3 lines showed that blockade by
ER-076349 is reversible, whereas eribulin's blockade is irreversible. We conclude that ER-076349's reversibility and
eribulin's irreversibility are compound-specific, cell type–
independent characteristics.
Mitotic block reversibility of other tubulin-targeted
agents
To test the generality of the mitotic block reversibility
concept, reversibility assays were done with paclitaxel, vinblastine, vincristine, colchicine, colcemid, and nocodazole.
Results are presented in Table 1, along with data from the
eribulin and ER-076349 studies of Figure 4. As already noted,
eribulin and ER-076349 were irreversible and moderately
reversible mitotic blockers (reversibility ratios: 1 and 12,
respectively). Paclitaxel was moderately reversible, (reversibility ratio: 14). Interestingly, vinblastine and vincristine
showed widely different reversibility behaviors (reversibility
ratios: 65 and 1, respectively); vincristine is thus an irreversible
mitotic blocker, like eribulin. Similarly, although colchicine
was almost completely irreversible (reversibility ratio: 1.7),
colcemid was highly reversible (reversibility ratio: >100).

Nocodazole was also highly reversible (reversibility ratio:
>100), consistent with its common use as a mitotic synchronizing agent. Overall, results of this survey of tubulin-targeted
agents suggest that mitotic block reversibility profiles are
unique, quantifiable, and compound-specific characteristics
of individual compounds. Importantly, even small structural
changes in compounds within a given class can lead to
profound differences in mitotic block reversibility (e.g., eribulin versus ER-076349, vincristine versus vinblastine, colchicine
versus colcemid).
Mitotic block reversibility and Bcl-2 phosphorylation
Because previous studies showed close correlations
between Bcl-2 phosphorylation and eribulin-induced apoptosis (12), relationships between eribulin and ER-076349 mitotic
block reversibility and Bcl-2 phosphorylation were assessed
(Fig. 5). Bcl-2 phosphorylation was not detected in untreated
U-937 cells at 0 hour or 10 hours. At 0 hour (after 12 hours
pretreatment), Bcl-2 phosphorylation was seen with
0.3 nmol/L ER-076349 and 3 nmol/L eribulin and all higher
concentrations of both drugs. In parallel with differences in
mitotic block reversibility, maintaining Bcl-2 phosphorylation 10 hour postwashout required 10 nmol/L ER-076349
(33-fold higher than 0 hour), whereas 3 nmol/L eribulin both
induced phosphorylation at 0 hour and sustained it 10 hours
postwashout. Differences in Bcl-2 phosphorylation thus
parallel differences in mitotic block reversibility, linking
sustained postwashout mitotic blockade to apoptosis induction and, ultimately, to long-term cell-viability loss.
Cellular uptake and washout/retention of [3H]eribulin
and [3H]ER-076349
To investigate mechanisms underlying reversibility differences between eribulin and ER-076349, drug uptake and
washout/retention studies were done in U-937 cells using
tritiated compounds. These studies also included tritiated
vincristine and vinblastine as comparators to gauge general-

izability of findings. To establish preloading concentrations
for washout/retention studies, U-937 cells were incubated for
60 minutes (empirically determined minimum time needed
for maximal cell-associated radioactivity) with a range of
concentrations of [3H]eribulin, [3H]ER-076349, [3H]vincristine,
and [3H]vinblastine. Unexpectedly, the irreversible drugs eribulin and vincristine accumulated to much lower steady-state
levels than their reversible counterparts ER-076349 and vinblastine (Fig. 6A and B). Thus, to ensure starting with equal
intracellular concentrations for washout/retention studies,
cells were preloaded using different extracellular concentrations of the paired drugs: 800 nmol/L [3H]eribulin versus
100 nmol/L [3H]ER-076349, and 600 nmol/L [3H]vincristine
versus 190 nmol/L [3H]vinblastine (dashed lines, Fig. 6A and
B). Compound washout from cells was achieved via rapid 1:50
dilution with subsequent measurement of cell-associated
radioactivity by rapid centrifugation through cold sucrose
cushions. Only 10% to 20% of irreversible [3H]eribulin was
lost by 180 minutes postwashout, whereas reversible [3H]ER076349 levels dropped to approximately 35% at 60 minutes
and approximately 15% by 180 minutes (Fig. 6C). Similar
results were seen with the radiolabeled vincas: only minimal
losses of irreversible [3H]vincristine were seen at 180 minutes
postwashout, whereas approximately 90% of reversible
[3H]vinblastine was lost at 180 minutes postwashout (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
The aim of this study was to investigate whether cell-based
pharmacodynamic effects could explain eribulin's in vivo
superiority over ER-076349, an analog with greater in vitro
potency. Because previous studies of in vivo pharmacokinetics,
chemical stability in serum, and sensitivity to P-glycoprotein–
mediated efflux had failed to explain eribulin's in vivo superiority (17), we hypothesized that cellular differences in
response to fluctuating drug levels in vivo might provide an
explanation. Using a quantitative mitotic block reversibility

potential mechanisms contributing to different pharmacodynamic behaviors of eribulin and ER-076349.
Our results indicate that eribulin induces irreversible mitotic blockade after transient drug exposure, leading to longterm loss of cell viability that tracks closely with dose/
response characteristics of the sustained mitotic block. For
eribulin, there is no concentration below which an initial CMB

assay as a cell-based surrogate for in vivo drug level fluctuations, we asked whether eribulin and ER-076349 differed in
their abilities to maintain mitotic blockade after drug washout. Because prolonged eribulin-induced mitotic blockade
leads to apoptosis (12), the relevance of mitotic block reversibility to long-term cell viability was also examined. We also
considered relationships between mitotic block reversibility,

Eribulin Induces Irreversible Mitotic Blockade

becomes reversible postwashout (reversibility ratio: 1). In
contrast, ER-076349's mitotic blockade is reversible: approximately 12-fold higher concentrations are required to sustain
CMB postwashout (reversibility ratio: 12). Thus, within this
approximately 1-log concentration window, ER-076349–treated cells recover from CMB after washout, complete mitosis
and repopulate long-term viable cultures. With ER-076349,
long-term viability loss occurs only at concentrations high
enough to sustain postwashout CMB, that is, 12-fold higher
than those initially inducing CMB. The relevance of sustained
postwashout CMB, as opposed to initial CMB induction, is
thus shown by tight dose/response correlations with longterm viability.
Results with other antimitotic agents (paclitaxel, vinblastine, vincristine, colchicine, colcemid, nocodazole) suggest
that mitotic block reversibility is a quantifiable, compoundspecific property with relevance to antimitotic agents in
general. For instance, paclitaxel is moderately reversible
(reversibility ratio: 14), whereas vinblastine, colcemid, and
nocodazole show even greater reversibility (reversibility ratios:
65, >100, and >100, respectively). In contrast, and similar to
eribulin, vincristine is irreversible and colchicine is nearly so
(reversibility ratios: 1.0 and 1.7, respectively). It is noteworthy
that, within individual compound classes, dramatic differences in reversibility can occur with only small structural
changes. For instance, moderately reversible ER-076349 differs
from irreversible eribulin in only one substituent (C35-hydroxyl versus C35-amine, respectively). Similarly, one substituent
differentiates highly reversible vinblastine from irreversible
vincristine (N-methyl versus N-formyl, respectively), and
highly reversible colcemid from nearly irreversible colchicine
(N-methyl versus N-acetyl, respectively). Further evidence that
small structural changes can elicit large reversibility differences comes from previous studies of many HB analogs. In an
analysis of more than 30 analogs of HB's macrocyclic pharmacophore, reversibility ratios of 1 to more than 100 were
found (5, 20). Indeed, after early observations that highly
reversible analogs lacked in vivo activity, quantifying mitotic
block reversibility became an integral part of medicinal
chemistry optimization strategies that led to eribulin's discovery (5).
Phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 following prolonged activation of the mitotic spindle
checkpoint has been implicated in apoptosis induced by
antimitotic agents (21–24). Previous studies showed that
eribulin-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation tracks closely with
apoptosis induction (12). The current studies extend this by
showing that the reversibility of Bcl-2 phosphorylation mimics
mitotic block reversibility for eribulin and ER-076349, providing a link between mitotic block reversibility differences and
different long-term effects on viability. Thus, sustained Bcl-2
phosphorylation following eribulin's irreversible mitotic block
maintains inactivation of Bcl-2's antiapoptotic effects, leading
to apoptosis and complete loss of long-term viability at 5 days
postwashout.
Results from [3H]eribulin and [3H]ER-076349 uptake and
washout/retention studies suggest that eribulin's mitotic
block irreversibility results from sustained postwashout cel-

www.aacrjournals.org

lular retention, whereas ER-076349's reversibility results from
rapid postwashout drug loss. These results are consistent with
Okouneva and colleagues (14), who showed persistent postwashout [3H]eribulin retention compared with rapid postwashout [3H]ER-076349 loss in U-2 OS osteosarcoma cells.
Paradoxically, our results and those of Okouneva and colleagues (14) show that [3H]eribulin accumulates to substantially
lower steady-state levels compared with [3H]ER-076349, even
though the former is more persistently retained compared
with the latter. A similar situation occurred with the 2 vinca
alkaloids: Although irreversible [3H]vincristine accumulated
to lower steady-state levels, it was more persistently retained
compared with reversible [3H]vinblastine's higher initial accumulation, but greater postwashout loss. Overall, our results
and those of Okouneva and colleagues (14) are consistent with
the idea that the irreversible mitotic blockades induced by
eribulin and vincristine derive from persistent cellular retention of these drugs.
Although the basis for differences in drug uptake and
postwashout retention is unknown, two potential explanations come to mind. First, this may simply reflect differential
efflux via P-glycoprotein or related transporters. However, this
seems unlikely for several reasons. First, the P-glycoprotein
blocking agent verapamil (25) has no effect on uptake and
postwashout retention of either [3H]eribulin or [3H]ER-076349
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Second, eribulin and ER-076349 show
similar susceptibilities to P-glycoprotein–mediated efflux (17),
arguing against P-glycoprotein as the source of the 2 drugs’
different behaviors. Third, any transporter with sufficiently
high selectivity for eribulin to result in lower accumulation
would be expected to drive enhanced postwashout efflux, yet
the opposite was found: eribulin was more persistently
retained compared with ER-076349. On the basis of these
considerations, it seems unlikely that differential transporter
selectivity for eribulin and ER-076349 can account for
observed differences in mitotic block reversibility, drug
uptake, and postwashout retention.
Another possible explanation involves different tubulin
binding characteristics. Our studies showed correlations
between reversibility, drug uptake, and postwashout retention
for halichondrin analogs eribulin and ER-076349 and vinca
alkaloids vinblastine and vincristine. With respect to the
halichondrins, Smith and colleagues (15) showed that eribulin
binds predominantly to a small number of high affinity sites
on microtubule plus ends, with earlier work from that group
arguing against significant binding to microtubule sides on
the basis of eribulin's lack of effect on microtubule shortening
(13). Moreover, eribulin binds microtubule ends with approximately 10-fold greater potency than soluble tubulin heterodimers (15), suggesting that the number of eribulin binding
sites in cells is limited primarily by the number of microtubule
plus ends. Studies by Alday and Correia (26) showed that ER076349, but not eribulin, enhances tubulin self-association
into oligomers by binding at or near interdimer interfaces,
suggesting that ER-076349 can associate with existing oligomers, including microtubule sides. This would dramatically
increase the number of intracellular binding sites for ER-076349
relative to eribulin, and explain both our findings and those of

Okouneva and colleagues (14) that [3H]ER-076349 accumulates
in cells to significantly higher levels than [3H]eribulin. If the
lower number of binding sites at microtubule ends were of
higher affinity than those along the sides (accessible only to ER076349), this would also explain higher postwashout retention of
[3H]eribulin relative to [3H]ER-076349. Thus, although eribulin
would bind to lower numbers of intracellular sites than ER076349, its overall binding affinity would be greater, resulting in
slower off-rates and more persistent postwashout retention.
Although this is an attractive hypothesis, further comparative
studies of eribulin and ER-076349 binding to tubulin and
microtubules will be needed to clarify this issue.
Patterns of mitotic block reversibility, drug uptake, and
postwashout retention seen with eribulin and ER-076349 were
closely mirrored by similar findings with vincristine and vinblastine. Interestingly, vincristine binds with higher overall
affinity to tubulin than vinblastine (27), consistent with our
finding of greater postwashout retention of [3H]vincristine
relative to [3H]vinblastine. Also, although generally less potent
against cells, vincristine more effectively inhibits tubulin addition to microtubules in vitro compared with vinblastine (28), a
finding reminiscent of eribulin's lower cell-based potency compared with ER-076349 (10). Although the current studies focused
mainly on eribulin and ER-076349, with vincristine and vinblastine used as comparators, the similarities of mitotic block
reversibility, drug accumulation, retention, and some known
aspects of tubulin binding kinetics suggest that such patterns
may be generally applicable among structurally related members within individual classes of tubulin binding agents.
In summary, our results point to eribulin's ability to induce
irreversible mitotic blockade as a cell-based pharmacodynamic explanation for its superior in vivo efficacy relative
to the more potent ER-076349. Eribulin's irreversible mitotic
blockade leads to persistent inactivation of Bcl-2, leading to
apoptosis and complete long-term loss of cell viability.
Eribulin's irreversible mitotic blockade is associated with

lower cellular drug uptake yet more persistent postwashout
retention compared with ER-076349, although the precise
mechanisms behind this remain unclear. Preferential binding
of eribulin to small numbers of high affinity sites at microtubule ends may explain its persistent postwashout retention,
although further studies are needed to confirm this. Regardless of mechanism, correlations between eribulin's irreversibility and long-term postwashout cell-viability loss provide a
satisfying explanation for its in vivo superiority over ER-076349
in preclinical tumor models using intermittent dosing. In
ongoing clinical trials, eribulin is administered using
intermittent dosing. Its ability to induce irreversible mitotic
blockade in cancer cells may thus have important pharmacodynamic implications for its clinical activity as well, in
which fluctuations in circulating drug levels associated with
intermittent dosing routinely occur.
