Abstract
Lenalidomide and pomalidomide have both been evaluated
clinically for their properties as anticancer agents, with
lenalidomide being available commercially. We previously
reported that both compounds cause cell cycle arrest in
Burkitt’s lymphoma and multiple myeloma cell lines by
increasing the level of p21WAF-1 expression. In the present
study, we unravel the molecular mechanism responsible for
p21WAF-1 up-regulation using Namalwa cells as a human
lymphoma model. We show that the increase of p21WAF-1
expression is regulated at the transcriptional level through a
mechanism independent of p53. Using a combination of
approaches, we show that several GC-rich binding transcription factors are involved in pomalidomide-mediated upregulation of p21WAF-1. Furthermore, we report that p21WAF-1
up-regulation is associated with a switch from methylated to
acetylated histone H3 on p21WAF-1 promoter. Interestingly,
lysine-specific demethylase-1 (LSD1) silencing reduced both
pomalidomide and lenalidomide up-regulation of p21WAF-1,
suggesting that this histone demethylase is involved in the
priming of the p21WAF-1 promoter. Based on our findings, we
propose a model in which pomalidomide and lenalidomide
modify the chromatin structure of the p21WAF-1 promoter
through demethylation and acetylation of H3K9. This effect,
mediated via LSD1, provides GC-rich binding transcription
factors better access to DNA, followed by recruitment of RNA
polymerase II and transcription activation. Taken together,
our results provide new insights on the mechanism of action
of pomalidomide and lenalidomide in the regulation of gene
transcription, imply possible efficacy in p53 mutated and
deleted cancer, and suggest new potential clinical uses as an
epigenetic therapy. [Cancer Res 2009;69(18):7347–56]

Introduction
Lenalidomide (Revlimid) and pomalidomide are IMiDs immunomodulatory compounds developed by Celgene Corp. that
possess multiple cellular activities including direct inhibition of
hematopoietic tumor growth, immunomodulation via T-cell and
natural killer cell stimulation, enhancement of erythropoiesis, and
microenvironmental effects such as antiangiogenic activity (1–6).
These compounds have negative effects on hematopoietic tumor

cell proliferation and positive effects on CD34+ cell expansion
(1–6). Lenalidomide has been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for the treatment of patients with transfusiondependent anemia due to low-risk or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic
abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities,
and in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of
multiple myeloma patients who have received at least one prior
therapy (7, 8). Myelodysplastic syndrome patients receiving
lenalidomide therapy experience a significant erythroid response
characterized by a cytogenetic reduction of the malignant clone
and restoration of bone marrow function that leads to transfusion
independence (7, 9). Pomalidomide is currently under evaluation
for the treatment of hematologic cancers (10). We previously
reported that lenalidomide and pomalidomide induce G0-G1
growth arrest in the Burkitt’s lymphoma Namalwa cells and
multiple myeloma LP-1 and U266 cells by increasing the levels of
p21WAF-1 RNA and protein. An increase in p21WAF-1 expression was
also observed in patient primary multiple myeloma cells on
treatment with IMiDs immunomodulatory compounds (1). In
addition, we presented evidence that p21WAF-1 up-regulation
inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-2, CDK4, and CDK6 kinase
activity, which leads to the loss of pRb phosphorylation and the
inability of these cells to progress into S phase (11). In this report,
we investigate the mechanism by which lenalidomide and
pomalidomide up-regulate p21WAF-1 expression.
The transcriptional regulation of p21WAF-1 has been extensively
studied. p21WAF-1 is a transcriptional target of p53 and plays a
crucial role in mediating growth arrest when cells are exposed to
DNA-damaging agents (12, 13). However, it has been shown that
p21WAF-1 is up-regulated in cells where p53 is mutated or silenced,
indicating that other transcription factors such as Sp1/Sp3, Egr1,
and others are involved (14, 15).
The regulation of chromatin structure has been described as a
second level of transcriptional regulation for p21WAF-1. DNA
methylation of its promoter has been reported in cancer and plays
a role in protein regulation (16, 17). It has been suggested that DNA
methylation of p21WAF-1 promoter affects promoter accessibility for
the transcription factors. Indeed, Zhu and colleagues hypothesized
that hypermethylation of p21WAF-1 promoter around the consensus
Sp1 binding sites may directly reduce Sp1/Sp3 binding, thereby
decreasing p21WAF-1 expression. A second epigenetic mechanism
shown to regulate p21WAF-1 transcription is histone acetylation.
Both histone acetylases (HAT) and histone deacetylases (HDAC)
are key enzymes that catalyze the reversible acetylation/deacetylation of core histone tails (18). Recent evidence indicates that
selected HDAC inhibitors may arrest human tumor cells in G1
phase of the cell cycle by increasing the mRNA and protein levels of
p21WAF-1 (19, 20).

Finally, histone methylation has been linked to p21WAF-1
promoter regulation. Duan and colleagues (21) reported that the
repression of p21WAF-1 transcription was associated with dimethylation of H3K9 by the histone methyltransferase G9a. These
observations imply that the H3K9me2 mark present on p21WAF-1
promoter should be demethylated to have the gene transcribed.
Originally, it was assumed that histone methylation was an
irreversible epigenetic event; however, a few years ago, the cloning
of the first lysine demethylase, named lysine-specific demethylase 1
(LSD1), was reported (22, 23). LSD1 has a dual effect depending on
the residue it demethylates. When associated with the CoRest
complex, LSD1 demethylates the activator mark H3K4 and
participates in gene repression (22). When associated with
coactivators, LSD1 is involved in transcription activation through
demethylation of H3K9me2.
In this study, we show that pomalidomide and lenalidomide
regulate p21WAF-1 expression at the transcriptional level through a
mechanism involving GC-rich DNA binding transcription factors
such as Sp1, Sp3, Egr1, and Egr2. Further experiments indicate that
our compounds improve DNA accessibility through a decrease of
histone methylation on H3K9 and an increase of histone
acetylation. We propose that both pomalidomide and lenalidomide
facilitate histone acetylation by an LSD1-dependent mechanism
inducing histone demethylation. This study provides new insights
on the mechanism of action of pomalidomide and lenalidomide to
regulate gene transcription and suggests their new potential
clinical uses as epigenetic therapy.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Namalwa CSN.70 and LP-1 cells were purchased from DSMZ.
Lenalidomide and pomalidomide (Celgene Corp.) were dissolved in DMSO.
Antibodies were purchased from the following suppliers: p21WAF-1 (Cell
Signaling Technologies, Inc.); Sp1 (Abcam for chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and Millipore for Western blot), Sp3, LSD1, H3K9/K14ac,
H3K9me1, H3K9me2, H3K9me3, histone H3, and LSD1 (Millipore); and hactin (Sigma-Aldrich). Mithramycin A (MTM) was purchased from SigmaAldrich.
Cell culture. Namalwa cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 10% (Namalwa) or 15% (LP-1) fetal bovine serum. Cells
were treated with lenalidomide or pomalidomide with a final DMSO
concentration of 0.1%.
siRNA-mediated silencing. Two million Namalwa or LP-1 cells were
transfected by electroporation (Amaxa Nucleofactor system, Amaxa, Inc.)
with 0.2 to 0.4 nmol of Sp1, Sp3, or LSD1 SMRTpool siRNA (Dharmacon) or
with 0.4 nmol of Egr1 or Egr2 Stealth siRNA (Invitrogen). Once the silencing
of the target gene was obtained, cells were treated with pomalidomide or
lenalidomide for 24 h.
Real-time PCR analysis. Total RNAs were purified from cells using the
RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription-PCR and quantification of RNA
transcripts were done as previously described (10).
Gene expression microarrays. Total RNA was isolated from Namalwa
or LP1 cells using RNAeasy Plus (Qiagen). Affymetrix human U133A 2.0 or
human U133 2.0 plus gene chips were used for gene expression analysis. The
GC-RMA algorithm was used for analysis and all analysis was done using
GeneSpring 7.3 (Agilent Technologies). Results from replicate chips were
averaged for calculating the fold differences.
To evaluate the significance of the presence of Sp1 binding sites among
the promoters of pomalidomide-regulated genes identified, we used the
NextBio software. Genes differentially expressed were ranked according to
their response to pomalidomide or lenalidomide, and a list of genes
containing Sp1 binding sites in their promoter was identified. Significance
scores were evaluated as previously described (24, 25). Briefly, the null
hypothesis was that the distribution of up-regulated or down-regulated

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (18). September 15, 2009

genes containing Sp1 binding sites in their promoter is not significantly
different from what would be randomly expected given the platform; the
alternative hypothesis is that the genes containing Sp1 binding sites are
enriched in the upper rankings among up-regulated or down-regulated
genes compared with what would be expected in random samplings from
the microarray platform.
Western blot. Protein extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen)
and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were probed
with primary antibody overnight followed by Alexa-conjugated secondary
antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized and quantified with
Odyssey Infrared Imaging (LI-COR Biosciences). Representative images from
at least three independent experiments are presented in the figures.
Sp1 binding assay. The TransAM Sp1 Kit (Active Motif) was used to
assay the DNA-binding activity of Sp1 in nuclear extracts from Namalwa
cells. For competitive binding experiments, 5 Ag of nuclear extract from the
stimulated cells were assayed in the presence of wild-type or mutated
competitor oligonucleotides.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. RNA polymerase II and p53
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were carried out by GenPathway,
Inc., as described by Labhart and colleagues (26). H3K9ac chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays were done in-house as previously described
(27, 28) using antibodies directed against acetylated histone H3 on lysines 9
and 14 (Millipore). H3K9me2 and Sp1 chromatin immunoprecipitation
assays were done according to Squazzo and colleagues (29) using antibodies
directed against dimethylated histone H3 on lysine 9 (Millipore) and Sp1
(Abcam), respectively. A complete protocol can be found online.3
Enrichment in the proximal region of p21WAF-1 promoter was quantified
by quantitative PCR using the primers 5¶-GCCAGATTTGTGGCTCACTTCGTGGG-3¶ and 5¶-CTGCCCAGCGCCGAGCCAGCTGAG-3¶, and
enrichment of optic actrophy-1 (OPA-1) promoter was quantified by
quantitative PCR using the primers 5¶-CCGCCTAGAAAGGGTGAAGT-3¶ and
5¶-CAGGAATGACCCAGGAAGTG-3¶. Data were normalized to input DNA.
Error bars represent SDs calculated from triplicate quantitative PCR
determinations.
HDAC assay. Twenty micrograms of HeLa nuclear extract (Upstate) were
incubated with pomalidomide or lenalidomide for 1 h. HDAC activity was
measured using a HDAC colorimetric assay kit (Upstate).
Histone methylation. Five micrograms of purified histones were
subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 16% Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen), transferred
onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted with antibodies against
H3K9me1, H3K9me2, H3K9me3, and histone H3. After incubation with
Alexa-coupled secondary antibodies, immunoreactive bands were visualized
with Odyssey Infrared Imaging (LI-COR).
Statistics. Statistical analysis was done using Student’s t test. P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant. In the figures, P < 0.05 (*), P < 0.01
(**), and P < 0.001 (***) indicate significant differences as compared with
DMSO.

Results
Pomalidomide and lenalidomide activate p21WAF-1 transcription. We previously reported that p21WAF-1 RNA expression
was induced by pomalidomide and lenalidomide in Namalwa cells
after 8 hours of treatment (11). To investigate the early mechanistic
events involved, we first analyzed the regulation of p21WAF-1 RNA
expression and the recruitment of RNA polymerase II on p21WAF-1
gene in response to pomalidomide and lenalidomide in timecourse experiments.
Figure 1A shows that p21WAF-1 RNA expression was up-regulated
by pomalidomide as early as after 2 hours of treatment. After 24
hours of treatment, the RNA expression of p21WAF-1 was increased
by 7-fold as compared with cells treated with DMSO. Chromatin

Epigenetic Regulation of p21WAF-1 Transcription

Figure 1. The up-regulation of p21WAF-1 by pomalidomide and lenalidomide is transcriptionally regulated. A and C, real-time PCR assessing p21WAF-1 RNA expression
in Namalwa cells treated with 10 Amol/L pomalidomide (A ) or lenalidomide (C ). B and D, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay evaluating the recruitment of RNA
polymerase II on p21WAF-1 gene in response to pomalidomide (B) or lenalidomide (C ).

immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that pomalidomide
induced the recruitment of RNA polymerase II on the coding region
of p21WAF-1 gene (Fig. 1B) in a time-dependent manner and
correlated with the up-regulation of p21WAF-1 RNA expression. The
same correlation was observed with Namalwa cells treated with
lenalidomide for 6 and 24 hours (Fig. 1C and D).
Identification of the transcription factors involved in
pomalidomide-induced p21WAF-1 up-regulation. The transcription of p21WAF-1 is under the control of a dozen proteins, but two
major transcription factors have been reported to play a critical
role in the regulation of p21WAF-1 promoter: p53 and Sp1. p53 binds
p21WAF-1 promoter in its distal region (at 2301 and 1394 bp
relative to the transcription start site), whereas Sp1 binds p21WAF-1
promoter in its proximal GC-rich region (between 119 and +1 bp
relative to the transcription start site; Fig. 2A; ref. 14).
In Namalwa cells, it is known that p53 contains a mutation in its
DNA binding domain (30). This mutation was confirmed in the
Namalwa cell line we used by both sequencing and ELISA-based gel
shift assays, in which no specific binding of p53 extracted from
Namalwa nuclei to an oligonucleotide containing a p53 binding site
was observed (data not shown). We also performed chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays using a p53 antibody in Namalwa
cells. As a positive control, we used A549 cells, in which p53 is
known to up-regulate p21WAF-1 in response to actinomycin D.
Whereas p53 strongly binds p21WAF-1 promoter in actinomycin

www.aacrjournals.org

D–treated A549 cells, no recruitment of p53 was detected in
pomalidomide-treated Namalwa cells (Fig. 2A). These results were
observed for both p53 binding sites described on p21WAF-1
promoter (regions A and B in Fig. 2A). Taken together, these data
exclude a role of p53 in pomalidomide- and lenalidomide-induced
up-regulation of p21WAF-1.
The second transcription factor we studied belongs to the Sp
transcription factor family. Sp1 is known to interact with GC-rich
promoter sequences and to have its binding inhibited by MTM (31).
The treatment of Namalwa cells by MTM abolished both the upregulation of p21WAF-1 RNA expression (Fig. 2B ) and the
recruitment of RNA polymerase II on p21WAF-1 gene (Fig. 2C),
suggesting that, in contrast to p53, Sp1 is involved in the activation
of p21WAF-1 promoter.
To confirm this hypothesis, we analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay the recruitment of Sp1 on p21WAF-1 promoter
in response to pomalidomide. Figure 2D shows that, as early as at 2
hours, Sp1 recruitment is induced. This effect was time dependent,
with more than 2-fold increase of Sp1 binding detected at 2, 6, and
24 hours.
To expand these findings to other genes up-regulated by
pomalidomide, an expression profiling experiment was done in
Namalwa cells using Affymetrix gene expression microarrays. The
analysis of the promoters of genes up-regulated by pomalidomide
after 4 and 8 hours showed a significant enrichment for genes with

Sp1 binding sites (P = 0.0035 and P = 0.0007, respectively), whereas
down-regulated genes did not show any enrichment (Fig. 3A). Sp1
binding site enrichment was also found in genes up-regulated by
pomalidomide in the multiple myeloma cell line LP-1 cells,
described to be responsive to pomalidomide (11). Based on this
in silico analysis of promoters, we conclude that pomalidomide
preferentially up-regulates genes whose promoters contain Sp1
binding sites.
Pomalidomide does not regulate Sp1 expression or Sp1
binding activity. To assess by which mechanism Sp1 regulates
p21WAF-1 transcription in response to pomalidomide, we studied
the effect of this compound on Sp1 RNA and protein levels, as well
as on Sp1 binding activity.
Namalwa cells treated with pomalidomide for different time
periods did not show any modulation of Sp1 RNA levels, as
quantified by real-time PCR (Fig. 3B), or Sp1 protein levels
(Fig. 3C). Moreover, MTM treatment did not modify Sp1 expression
(Fig. 3C), excluding the hypothesis that MTM would affect
pomalidomide-induced up-regulation of p21WAF-1 transcription by
regulating Sp1 expression. These results indicate that pomalidomide does not up-regulate p21WAF-1 by modifying Sp1 expression.
To determine whether pomalidomide modulates Sp1 activity, we
performed ELISA-based Sp1 binding assays using nuclear extracts
from Namalwa cells treated with 10 Amol/L pomalidomide and
1 Amol/L MTM for different times. Although Sp1 extracted from

Namalwa nuclei was able to specifically bind to a Sp1 binding site
containing oligonucleotide (Fig. 3D, controls), no change in Sp1
binding was observed in response to pomalidomide treatment for
2, 4, or 6 hours. This result indicated that pomalidomide upregulates p21WAF-1 expression without modifying Sp1 activity.
To assess the importance of Sp1 in the regulation of p21WAF-1
by pomalidomide, we used siRNA technology to silence Sp1.
Figure 4A shows that Sp1 protein levels were significantly
decreased in Sp1 siRNA–transfected cells as compared with
control siRNA–transfected cells and that Sp1 silencing blunted
pomalidomide-induced p21WAF-1 up-regulation by 35%.
Whereas this result shows that Sp1 plays an important role in
the process, it also reveals that other transcription factors that also
bind GC-rich regions may be involved. Among GC-rich DNA
binding site transcription factors described to be involved in
p21WAF-1 transcription regulation, we tested the role of Sp3, Egr1,
and Egr2. As observed for Sp1, the silencing of Sp3, Egr1, and Egr2
individually by siRNA reduced the up-regulation of p21WAF-1 by
pomalidomide by 44%, 57%, and 36%, respectively (Fig. 4B and C).
Taken together, these results indicate that several GC-rich DNA
binding transcription factors are involved in p21WAF-1 upregulation by pomalidomide.
Pomalidomide induces chromatin modifications on p21WAF-1
promoter. We first analyzed the DNA methylation status of the
p21WAF-1 promoter. Three CpG-rich regions were identified in the

Epigenetic Regulation of p21WAF-1 Transcription

promoter using EMBOSS CpG plot. Bisulfite sequencing experiments showed that none of these regions was methylated in
Namalwa cells treated with 0.1% DMSO (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Thus, we extrapolate that pomalidomide-mediated up-regulation of
p21WAF-1 does not act through this mechanism.
We then focused on the acetylation of histone H3 on lysines 9
and 14 (H3K9/14ac), which has been largely described to be
associated with open chromatin and transcriptional activation
(18, 32). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we
showed that pomalidomide treatment increased H3K9/14
acetylation in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). Indeed, as

www.aacrjournals.org

early as 30 minutes, the increase in the acetylation of H3K9 was
observed, reaching more than 2-fold after 3 and 6 hours of
treatment.
Because the increase of acetylation could result from an
inhibition of HDACs, we measured the ability of pomalidomide
and lenalidomide to inhibit the deacetylation of histones in an
in vitro assay. In contrast to the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A,
pomalidomide and lenalidomide did not inhibit HDAC activity at
any dose tested (Fig. 5B), suggesting that these compounds do not
up-regulate the acetylation of H3K9/14 on p21WAF-1 promoter by
directly inhibiting HDACs.

Finally, we analyzed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
the dimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me2), a mark
which is associated with transcriptional repression, on p21WAF-1
promoter in the presence of DMSO or 10 Amol/L pomalidomide. As
shown in Fig. 5C, H3K9 was dimethylated in basal conditions,
which is consistent with the absence of p21WAF-1 transcription.
Interestingly, pomalidomide led to a 6-fold decrease of H3K9me2
after 6 hours. Interestingly, no modification was observed on the
promoter of OPA-1, a gene that is not regulated by pomalidomide
in Namalwa cells.
To determine whether pomalidomide specifically regulates H3K9
methylation on p21WAF-1 promoter, we assessed the methylation of
total histone H3. The Western blot method shown in Fig. 5D
indicates that Namalwa cells treated with pomalidomide or
lenalidomide for 1, 6, and 24 hours did not present any change
in tri-, di-, and mono-methylation of H3K9. These data suggest that
pomalidomide regulates p21WAF transcription through specific
demethylation of H3K9 on its promoter.
LSD1 is a histone demethylase described to participate in gene
transcription through demethylation of H3K9me2. By chromatin

immunoprecipitation assay, we confirmed that the presence of
LSD1 on several promoters was concomitant with the presence of
the H3K9ac mark and the absence of the H3K9me2 mark (data not
shown). Using siRNAs, we tested the involvement of LSD1 in
p21WAF-1 up-regulation. Figure 6A shows that LSD1 silencing
reduced both pomalidomide- and lenalidomide-induced p21WAF-1
up-regulation. The statistical analysis of several independent
experiments indicates that this effect is significant at P < 0.05 for
1 and 10 Amol/L of the compounds (Fig. 6B).
The up-regulation of p21WAF-1 by pomalidomide and lenalidomide is not restricted to Namalwa cells, as we have previously
shown that p21WAF-1 was up-regulated in the multiple myeloma cell
lines LP-1 and U266 (11). Figure 6C shows that this up-regulation of
p21WAF-1 is also decreased in LP-1 cells silenced for LSD1,
extending the role of this demethylase in the mechanism of action
of pomalidomide and lenalidomide in a myeloma cell line.
The histone methyltransferase G9a has been reported to be
associated with the repression of p21WAF-1 promoter in HL-60 cells
(21). Nevertheless, the silencing of G9a in our model did not
significantly affect the basal level of p21WAF-1 or its up-regulation by

pomalidomide and lenalidomide (data not shown). These observations suggest that the silencing of G9a is not sufficient to
derepress the p21WAF-1 gene and that G9a does not play a critical
role in the mechanism of action of pomalidomide and lenalidomide.
From these data, we propose the following model, illustrated in
Fig. 6D. Under basal condition, p21WAF-1 promoter is silenced
through the dimethylation of H3K9. Through a mechanism to be
elucidated, pomalidomide and lenalidomide would lead to the
activation of demethylases, such as LSD1, which removes the
H3K9me2 mark from p21WAF-1 promoter, allowing the acetylation
of this residue by HATs. The change of conformation of the
chromatin resulting from the acetylation of H3K9 allows the
binding of Sp1, Sp3, Egr1, and Egr2 and the recruitment of RNA
polymerase II on p21WAF-1 promoter, which leads to gene
transcription.

Discussion
The transcription factor p53 possesses a critical function as a
tumor suppressor gene. p53 is normally activated by cellular stress
such as DNA damage, hypoxia, and deficiency of growth factors or

www.aacrjournals.org

nutrients, and mediates a growth-suppressive response that
involves cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In the case of cell cycle
arrest, p21WAF-1 seems to be sufficient to block cell cycle
progression out of G1 until repair has occurred or cellular stress
has been resolved. In more than half of the tumors, p53 is mutated
or deleted (33), which is associated with prognosis, progression,
and therapeutic response of tumors (34, 35). In our study, we
present evidence that lenalidomide and pomalidomide up-regulate
p21WAF-1 through a p53-independent pathway by using p53 doublemutant Namalwa cells (36). The fact that lenalidomide and
pomalidomide can induce cell cycle arrest through p21WAF-1 by
bypassing p53 expands their use in a large panel of tumors
independently of p53 status.
In this study, we show that GC-rich DNA binding transcription
factors play an important role in pomalidomide-induced-p21WAF-1
transcription. This is suggested by the fact that the treatment
of Namalwa cells by MTM, which inhibits all transcription factors
binding to GC-rich regions (37), abolished the up-regulation
of p21WAF-1. Sp1, whose binding to DNA is inhibited by MTM
(31), is involved in the up-regulation of p21WAF-1 in several cell
types (14, 38), as well as in the repression of this gene (39–42). In
addition, Sp3, Egr1, and Egr2 bind GC-rich regions and have been

described to bind p21WAF-1 promoter and regulate its transcription
(20, 43–45). Here, we showed that Sp1 is recruited to p21WAF-1
promoter as early as 2 hours after treatment, and its silencing by
siRNA attenuated pomalidomide-induced p21WAF-1 up-regulation.
Moreover, Sp1, Sp3, Egr1, and Egr2 silencing experiments showed a
slighter p21WAF-1 up-regulation by pomalidomide. However, the
silencing of none of these GC-rich DNA binding transcription
factors independently was able to completely inhibit p21WAF-1
up-regulation, suggesting that either the level of protein silenced
was not sufficient to totally repress pomalidomide up-regulation

of p21WAF-1 or/and these transcription factors act in concert to
activate p21WAF-1.
Our data suggest that pomalidomide favors the accessibility of
GC-rich DNA binding transcription factors to p21WAF-1 promoter.
We hypothesized that pomalidomide and lenalidomide might
induce p21WAF-1 transcription through epigenetic modifications.
Bisulfite sequencing experiments indicated that the CpG regions of
p21WAF-1 promoter in Namalwa cells in basal conditions were not
methylated, which subsequently ruled out the hypothesis that
regulation of DNA methylation was important. Interestingly, we

Epigenetic Regulation of p21WAF-1 Transcription

uncovered the modification of the status of H3K9 on nucleosomes
decorating p21WAF-1 proximal promoter. Whereas H3K9 acetylation
has been described to be an activator mark of transcription (18),
the dimethylation of the same residue has been associated with
gene repression (21, 23). In our model of pomalidomide-induced
p21WAF-1 expression, we observed a fine regulation of modification
of this mark with a switch of H3K9 methylation to H3K9
acetylation.
The acetylation of histones H3 and H4 correlates with an open
state of chromatin, which allows the recruitment of various
transcription factors to the promoters. The regulation of histone
acetylation, which is maintained by a dynamic balance of HDACs
and HATs, plays an important role in the modulation of p21WAF-1
expression, as illustrated in previous studies (19, 20, 38, 43, 44). In
addition, several synthetic and natural HDAC inhibitors showed a
consistent up-regulation of p21WAF-1 expression in various cancer
cell lines (19, 20, 45, 46). We propose that the pomalidomideinduced increase of H3K9 acetylation, possibly due to the dismissal
of HDACs from p21WAF-1 promoter, leads to the relaxation of the
chromatin structure and allows the full recruitment of GC-rich
DNA binding transcription factors including Sp1, Sp3, Egr1, and
Egr2. Such a mechanism is in agreement with previous publications
on Sp1 and Sp3 (19, 38, 47).
Importantly, although H3K9 acetylation increased on p21WAF-1
promoter in response to pomalidomide and lenalidomide, we
conclude that none of these compounds were HDAC inhibitors
because (a) the global level of histone H3 acetylation was not
altered (data not shown) and (b) HDAC assays assessing the effect
of pomalidomide and lenalidomide on the inhibition of HDACs
in vitro gave negative results.
Our study suggests that pomalidomide and lenalidomide might
regulate the activity of the histone demethylase LSD1, which would
participate in the demethylation of H3K9. LSD1 demethylates
histone through a flavin-dependent mechanism (22). Its activity on
promoters can lead to gene transcription or repression, depending
on which residue is demethylated. In addition to its repressor role
and as observed by Metzger and colleagues (23), LSD1 can act as a
transcriptional coactivator by demethylating H3K9. This study

done in LNCaP cells showed that LSD1 activity is required for
androgen-dependent gene expression. LSD1-dependent transcriptional activation is not restricted to androgen receptor function in
prostate cancer cells because a genome-wide location analysis of
LSD1 in MCF7 human breast cancer cells reported a surprisingly
large number of promoters bound to LSD1, among which 84% were
also associated with RNA polymerase II (48), underlining the
importance of LSD1 in gene activation. LSD1 has already been
reported to up-regulate p21WAF-1 through p53 stabilization (49).
Our study describes for the first time that LSD1 participates in
p21WAF-1 transcription in a p53-independent manner.
Several mechanisms by which pomalidomide and lenalidomide
activate LSD1 can be considered. In our study, LSD1 was detected
only on active H3K9ac-positive promoters and is absent from
promoters on which H3K9 is dimethylated. These observations
suggest that pomalidomide and lenalidomide induce p21WAF-1 upregulation by mediating the recruitment of LSD1 on the promoter.
This could result from a direct mechanism (posttranslational
modification of LSD1 protein) or from an indirect mechanism
involving the activation of a third partner required for LSD1
activation. Taken together, this study shows for the first time that
pomalidomide and lenalidomide are regulating gene transcription
through the regulation of acetylation and methylation of H3K9,
providing new insights on the mechanism of action of these
compounds.
