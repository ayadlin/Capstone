Abstract
Androgen receptor (AR)– and glucocorticoid receptor (GR)–
mediated signaling play opposite roles in prostate tumorigenesis: AR promotes prostate carcinoma (PC) development,
whereas GR acts as a tumor suppressor. Compound A (CpdA)
is a stable analogue of an aziridine precursor from the African
shrub Salsola tuberculatiformis Botschantzev. It was shown
recently that, in model cells, CpdA inhibits AR function and
strongly enhances anti-inflammatory function of GR. We
determined the effects of CpdA in prostate cells with different
AR/GR status: (a) RWPE-1 cells (ARlow/GRlow), (b) PC3 and
DU145 cells (GR+/AR ), (c) LNCaP cells (GR /AR+), and (d)
LNCaP-GR cells expressing both receptors. Similar to steroid
hormones, CpdA induces nuclear translocation of both
receptors in prostate cells. Despite this, CpdA inhibits DNAbinding and transactivation potential of AR. In addition, CpdA
inhibits GR-mediated transactivation but induces GR transrepression via inhibition of several transcription factors,
including nuclear factor-KB, AP-1, Ets-1, Elk-1, SRF, CRE/
ATF, and NFATc. CpdA strongly decreases growth and induces
caspase-dependent apoptosis in highly malignant PC3 and
DU145 cells and in other AR/GR-expressing PC cells. The
cytostatic effect of CpdA is receptor dependent: downregulation of GR or AR expression drastically attenuates
CpdA-induced PC cell growth inhibition. Finally, virtual
docking analysis indicates that CpdA shares binding cavities
in AR and GR ligand-binding domains with corresponding
hormones and forms hydrogen bonds (H-bond) with the same
amino acids that are involved in H-bond formation during
steroid binding. Overall, our data suggest that CpdA is a
unique dual-target steroid receptor modulator that has a high
potential for PC therapy. [Cancer Res 2008;68(12):4763–73]

Introduction
Signaling mediated through the steroid hormone receptors plays
a pivotal role in the development of prostate cancer (PC).
Androgens and androgen receptor (AR) promote the development
and progression of PC at the stage of hormone-dependent cancer
(1–4). Thus, androgen ablation or blockade of AR function has been
the cornerstone of treatment of advanced PC (1–4). In contrast, we

and others showed that signaling mediated by the glucocorticoid
receptor (GR) plays a tumor suppressor role in prostate (5–9). PC
cells expressing GR are sensitive to the growth-inhibitory effect of
glucocorticoids in vitro and in vivo when grown as xenografts in
athymic mice (6–9). The activation of GR signaling results in
differentiation of PC cells and ‘‘normalization’’ of expression
pattern of PC markers, such as hepsin, AMACR, and maspin (7).
Glucocorticoids also inhibit angiogenesis and lymphogenesis in PC
cell–derived tumors (8, 9).
AR and GR are closely related transcription factors (TF) that
belong to a superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors (10, 11). After
binding to corresponding steroid hormones, AR and GR dissociate
from chaperone proteins in cytoplasm, form homodimers, and
translocate to the nucleus where they bind DNA through hormoneresponsive elements (HRE) to activate gene expression (transactivation; refs. 10–12). In addition to the genomic, DNA-binding
dependent transactivation, there are DNA-binding independent,
nongenomic mechanisms of gene regulation by steroid receptors
that are chiefly mediated via cross-talk with other TFs. The indirect
regulation of gene expression by GR is better studied. It was
shown that GR interacts with numerous TFs, including AP-1,
nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB), signal transducer and activator of
transcription-5 (STAT5), and SMAD3 (7, 10, 13–15). Most of such
GR-TF interactions repress the activity of partner TFs and their
target genes (transrepression). One more mechanism of indirect
negative gene regulation by GR involves inhibition of mitogenactivated protein kinases. This mechanism is used in different cells,
including PC cells (5, 7, 13, 15, 16). Indirect, DNA-independent
mechanisms of GR gene regulation seem to be critical for the antiinflammatory effects of glucocorticoids (13). Our work indicates
that tumor suppressor effects of GR/glucocorticoids also involve
gene transrepression (7, 16). The interaction between AR and other
TFs is much less studied. However, there is growing evidence that
AR interacts with other TFs, including AP-1, NF-nB, and Ets family
members, and this interaction can modulate activity of those TFs
and consequently the transcription of their target genes (3, 10, 17, 18).
Taking into consideration the opposite roles of AR- and GRmediated signaling in prostate tumorigenesis, the multitarget
steroid receptor modulators that act as antiandrogens but at the
same time induce GR-mediated transrepression hold a great
potential for PC treatment. Our work presented here is centered on
a novel AR/GR ligand, 2-(4-acetoxyphenyl)-2-chloro-N-methylethylammonium chloride, also called compound A (CpdA). CpdA
is a synthetic analogue of a hydroxyphenyl aziridine precursor
found in the African shrub Salsola tuberculatiformis Botschantzev
(19–22). It was shown that CpdA, like the active plant extracts,
interacts with steroidogenic enzymes and steroid-binding globulins
in plasma displacing the endogenous steroids and affects the
bioavailability of these hormones in different target tissues (19, 20,
22). It was discovered recently that CpdA directly interacts with

steroid receptors AR and GR in model cells (19, 23). Remarkably,
CpdA inhibited AR activity via mechanisms similar to ones used by
clinically used antiandrogens flutamide and cyproterone acetate
(19, 24–27). CpdA was also reported to act as a GR ligand with
‘‘dissociated’’ properties: CpdA did not affect GR transactivation
but induced GR-mediated transrepression evaluated by inhibition
of NF-nB and NF-nB–dependent genes (23). Interestingly, in animal
experiments, CpdA acted as a strong anti-inflammatory compound
with reduced side effects such as hyperglycemia (23).
Overall, the literature data suggested that CpdA is a unique
modulator of steroid hormone receptors that inhibits AR function
and acts as a dissociated GR ligand. Our work was designed to
analyze CpdA docking into ligand-binding domains (LBD) of AR
and GR in comparison with steroids, to evaluate the effect of CpdA
on AR and GR function in prostate cells, and to assess its effect on
growth and apoptosis in a panel of prostate cells with different AR/
GR status. Our experiments suggest that CpdA can compete with
corresponding steroids for LBD binding. We also revealed strong
cytostatic and apoptotic effect of CpdA specifically in highly
malignant PC cells PC3 and DU145.

Materials and Methods
Cell cultures and treatments. LNCaP, PC3, and DU145 PC cells
[American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)] were cultured as described (7)
in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) with 10% fetal bovine serum (referred
thereafter as complete medium; HyClone). LNCaP-GR cells and empty
virus–expressing (LNCaP-V) control cells were generated by lentivirus
infection as described (7). RWPE-1 normal prostate cells (ATCC) were
cultured in serum-free, low Ca2+ medium supplemented with pituitary
extract (Invitrogen Corp.). Cells were treated with CpdA (see below),
fluocinolone acetonide (FA; Sigma-Aldrich), dihydrotestosterone (DHT;
Sigma-Aldrich), antiandrogen Casodex (provided by AstraZeneca), antiglucocorticoid RU486 (Sigma-Aldrich), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a;
10 ng/mL; BioSource, Inc.), and interleukin-1 (IL-1; 1 Ag/AL; BioSource).
Synthesis of CpdA. The 2-(4-acetoxyphenyl)-2-chloro-N-methyl-ethylammonium chloride (CpdA) was synthesized from (F)-Synephrine and
acetyl chloride in glacial acetic acid by a modification of the original
method of Bretschneider (28).
Western blot analysis. Whole-cell protein extracts were prepared using
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer; cytoplasmic and nuclear protein
fractions were prepared using nuclear isolation kit (Panomics, Inc.) as
described (7). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). The following antibodies were used: anti-GR, anti-AR, anti-p65, and anti-c-Jun (all from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) and anti–poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; BD
PharMingen). Membranes were blocked with 5% Blotto in TBS and
incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4jC followed by
peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies
(Cell Signaling Technology). Enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for the band visualization. To verify
equal loading and adequate transfer, the membranes were probed with antiactin and/or anti-h-tubulin antibodies and, if necessary, histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC-1) as nuclear protein marker (all from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). To quantify the signals, images were scanned and digitized
using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD).
Transient transfections and luciferase assay. The Firefly luciferase
reporters TAT-Luc, MMTV. Luc, and x3 nB-Luc were described in previous
publication (7). AP-1, CRE/ATF, NFATc, SRF, Ets-1, and Elk-1 reporters were
obtained from Panomics. The transfection efficacy was normalized using
cotransfections with Renilla luciferase under minimal promoter (Promega
Corp.; ref. 29).
Prostate cells at 70% confluence were transfected in 48-well plates with
the indicated plasmids using Effectene reagent (Qiagen, Inc.) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Each well contained 0.2 Ag of the plasmid

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (12). June 15, 2008

DNA. All experimental groups contained at least three wells. The cells were
harvested 32 h after transfection and luciferase activity was measured using
Dual Luciferase kit (Promega). Cells were treated with AR and GR ligands or
corresponding vehicle (0.01% DMSO as a control for CpdA; 0.01% ethanol as
a control for other treatments) for 32 h. Treatments with TNF-a or IL-1
were performed for 32 h.
Proliferation assay. The proliferation was measured by direct cell
counting using Reichert hemacytometer. Cells were plated at 104 per well
onto 12-well plates and cultured in complete medium in the presence of
CpdA, FA, or vehicle (0.1% ethanol and/or DMSO) for 1 to 12 d. LNCaP-GR
and LNCaP-V cells were cultured in the presence of 6 Ag/AL blasticidin to
maintain the selection pressure. Each experimental and control group
consisted of three wells.
Apoptosis detection. To evaluate apoptosis, we used Western blot
analysis of PARP cleavage and ApoAlert Caspase Assay (BD Biosciences
Clontech). PC cells were plated on 10-cm dishes and treated with FA, CpdA,
and vehicle (0.1% ethanol and 0.1% DMSO) for 2 to 10 d, and adherent and
detached floating cells were collected. Apoptosis was induced by TNF-a
treatment for 24 h. PARP cleavage was estimated by Western blot analysis
with anti-PARP antibody using whole-cell protein extracts. ApoAlert Caspase
Assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol using
whole-cell lysates, and caspase activity was measured by a Victor plate
reader (Perkin-Elmer) with 380-nm excitation and 460-nm emission filters.
Colony formation in soft agar. The colony-forming assay was
performed as described previously (7). Forty-eight hours after plating, cells
were treated with FA, CpdA, or vehicle (0.1% ethanol and/or DMSO) for
2 wk. Complete medium was changed and new reagents were added twice
weekly. Stably infected LNCaP-GR and LNCaP-V cells were cultured in the
presence of 6 Ag/AL blasticidin to maintain the selection. Images of entire
wells were taken and colonies with diameter of >50 Am were counted using
AxioVision LE Rel. 4.5 software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.). Each
experimental group consisted of six wells.
Immunostaining. Cells plated on sterile coverslips in 24-well plates
(2.0  104 per well) were treated for 16 to 48 h with FA, DHT, CpdA, and
vehicle (0.1% ethanol and/or DMSO). To induce NF-nB and AP-1 nuclear
translocation, TNF-a or IL-1 was added to cell cultures for 30 min after
48-h pretreatment with FA and CpdA. The cells were fixed for 15 min in 2%
formaldehyde, permeabilized for 4 h with 50% acetone/50% methanol at
20jC, washed in PBS, and blocked for 1 h in 20% donkey serum. Primary
antibodies were applied overnight at 4jC. Anti-rabbit donkey FITCconjugated and/or anti-mouse donkey Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (both from Jackson ImmunoResearch) were applied and the staining
was analyzed using Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope with AxioCaM HRC
camera. 4¶,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) was used
to identify the nuclei. Images of stained cells were analyzed with AxioVision
LE Rel. 4.5 software.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Cells plated on 10-cm dishes were
treated with FA, DHT, CpdA, and vehicle (0.1% ethanol and/or DMSO) for
16 h. Nuclear proteins were isolated by commercial Nuclear Protein
Isolation kit (Panomics). The binding reaction for electrophoretic mobility
shift assay (EMSA) contained 10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 80 mmol/L KCl,
1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 6% glycerol, 0.5 Ag of poly(deoxyinosinicdeoxycytidylic acid), 0.5 Ag of sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 2 pmol doublestranded oligonucleotide of AR/GR HRE conjugated with IR fluorophore
IRDye 700 (LI-COR), and 10 Ag of the nuclear extract. To verify specificity of
AR (GR) protein-DNA complexes, binding reaction was performed at
increasing concentration of nonconjugated HRE (cold probe) and,
alternatively, with mutated HRE conjugated with IRDye 700. DNA-binding
reaction was performed at 16jC for 30 min in a final volume of 20 AL. DNAprotein complexes were analyzed by Tris-borate EDTA electrophoresis on
6% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5% glycerol. DNA-protein complexes
were visualized by an Odyssey IR scanner (LI-COR) with a 680-nm scanner
channel and linear graphical manipulations were made by the LI-COR
Odyssey software for quantitative image analysis (LI-COR).
Short interfering RNA technology. Validated short interfering RNA
(siRNA) against GR (siRNA Ambion ID 3909) and validated negative control
inactive siRNA (scrambled siRNA; Silencer Cy3-labeled Negative Control

siRNA) labeled with Cy3 were obtained from Ambion. GR-specific and
negative Cy3-labeled siRNAs were transfected into LNCaP-GR and PC3 cells
using HiperFect siRNA transfection reagent (Qiagen) at a final concentration of 40 nmol/L according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The siRNA
transfection efficiency was f90% to 95% in both PC3 and LNCaP-GR cell
cultures. To ensure long-term siRNA presence in the cells, cells were
retransfected with additional 20 nmol/L of GR-specific and scrambled
siRNAs every 5 d.
Radioligand-binding assay. Freshly harvested PC cells expressing
endogenous receptors were homogenized by sonication on ice in the
binding buffer [10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mmol/L EDTA, 5 mmol/L DTT,
20 mmol/L sodium molybdate] as described previously (30). The
homogenate was centrifuged at 4jC, 100,000  g for 1 h, and the
supernatant (cytosol fraction) was used for the binding reaction. The
binding assay was performed as described (30). Briefly, 200 AL of cytosol
(200 Ag protein per reaction) were incubated with 10 nmol/L [3H]dexamethasone ([3H]Dex) or [3H]DHT (both from Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech) for 24 h at 4jC. Bound and free hormones were separated by the
incubation with dextran-coated charcoal (Sigma-Aldrich), and the binding
was assessed by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. For competition-binding
assays, cytosol was incubated with 10 nmol/L [3H]Dex or [3H]DHT and 100fold molar excess of corresponding radioinert ligands, such as Dex, DHT,
or CpdA, for 24 h at 4jC. All binding reactions were performed in triplicate.
The competition between steroid hormones and CpdA for AR/GR binding
is presented as percentage to the inhibition of [3H]Dex or [3H]DHT binding
by the corresponding cold steroid hormones.
Virtual docking. For virtual docking, we used PDB files of recently
published crystal structures of AR (PDB identifier 1T7T; ref. 31) and GR
(PDB identifier 1P93; ref. 32) LBDs available from the Protein Bank
Database Web site4 and virtual docking software package Molegro (Molegro
ApS; ref. 33). As an additional control, we compared our data and published
results for AR/DHT and GR/Dex docking. Our data on steroid docking into
GR and AR LBDs, including identification of binding cavities, positions for
ligand binding, and points of hydrogen bond (H-bond) formation, were
identical to previously published results obtained with other docking
software (Fig. 1; refs. 34–36).
Statistical analysis. All experiments were repeated at least thrice. Mean
and SE values were calculated using Microsoft Excel software and compared
using paired Student’s t test. A P value of <0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Results
Evaluation of ligand properties of CpdA. CpdA has been
shown to interact with AR and GR in model cells (21, 23). To further
characterize CpdA ligand properties and to compare binding of
CpdA and natural steroid ligands to LBDs of AR and GR in terms of
potential binding cavities and amino acids involved in binding to
LBDs, we performed virtual docking. For analysis, we used recently
published crystal structures of AR and GR LBDs available from the
Protein Bank Database Web site (AR: 1T7T and GR: 1P93; refs. 31,
32) and virtual docking software (Molegro; ref. 33). As shown in
Fig. 1, CpdA shares binding cavities within LBDs of GR and AR with
corresponding steroid hormones Dex and DHT. Furthermore,
structural modeling predicts that CpdA will form H-bonds with
several amino acids lining these binding cavities of receptors, and
indicates that some of those amino acids (Asn564 and Arg611 in GR;
Asn705 and Arg752 in AR) are also involved in H-bond formation
with steroidal ligands of AR (DHT) and GR (Dex). Overall, our
virtual docking data clearly indicate that CpdA could act as a
ligand for both GR and AR, and suggest that CpdA would compete
with steroids for LBDs in steroid hormone receptors.

It was reported previously that CpdA indeed strongly competes
with glucocorticoid Dex for GR binding (23). However, the
competition between CpdA and androgen mibolerone for AR
binding seemed to be weak (21). Thus, we repeated the competitive
binding assay using cytosol fractions isolated from PC cells
expressing endogenous AR (LNCaP cells) and GR (DU145 cells).
Unlabeled hormones when added at the 100-fold molar excess
inhibited binding of corresponding [3H]hormones essentially by
100%. As shown in Fig. 1D, CpdA at the same 100-fold molar excess
inhibited [3H]Dex binding to GR by 85% and [3H]DHT binding to
AR by 30% compared with corresponding radioinert hormones.
Effect of CpdA on function of steroid hormone receptors. In
the next experiments, we assessed CpdA effect on the function of
endogenous receptors in a set of prostate cell lines with different
AR/GR status: androgen-dependent LNCaP PC cells (AR+/GR ),
two highly malignant androgen-independent cell lines DU145 and
PC3 (both are AR /GR+), and nontransformed prostate cell line
RWPE-1 with low AR expression (37). We also used in our work
stably transfected LNCaP-GR cells expressing both receptors that
we recently characterized in detail (7). Although the AR/GR status
for RWPE-1, LNCaP, DU145, and PC3 cells was previously
published, we performed Western blot analysis of whole-cell
protein extracts to directly compare the AR and GR protein levels
in different cells under study. As shown in Supplementary Data 1,
parental LNCaP and LNCaP-GR cells expressed significant amount
of AR, and DU145, PC3, and LNCaP-GR cells expressed significant
amount of GR; the level of both receptors was low in RWPE-1 cells.
As only LNCaP-GR cells expressed significant amount of both
receptors, we extensively used those cells to compare the effect of
CpdA on AR and GR function.
Immunostaining and Western blot analysis revealed that, similar
to androgen DHT, CpdA induced AR nuclear translocation in
LNCaP-GR cells with endogenous AR (Fig. 2A). However, in
contrast to DHT, CpdA inhibited both constitutive and DHTinduced AR DNA binding and AR transcription activity in luciferase
test (Fig. 2B). In this respect, the effect of CpdA on AR activity
closely resembles the effect of known antiandrogen Casodex
(Fig. 2B; refs. 38, 39). The effect of CpdA on AR transcriptional
activity depended on concentration and plateaued at 10 5 to 10 7
mol/L. This correlates well with the biologically effective CpdA
concentration range used in previous work (21–23).
The same strategy was used to study the effects of CpdA on GR
localization and function in PC cells expressing endogenous (DU145
and PC3) and exogenous (LNCaP-GR) GR. According to Western blot
analysis and immunostaining, in LNCaP-GR cells, CpdA induced GR
nuclear import, although at a significantly less extent than
glucocorticoid FA (Fig. 2C). CpdA inhibited constitutive and FAinduced GR-DNA binding and GR transcription activity in LNCaPGR cells (Fig. 2D) as well as in PC3 and DU145 cells (Supplementary
Data 2). Moreover, the inhibitory effects of CpdA and known
glucocorticoid antagonist RU486 (23, 28) on hormone-induced GR
transcriptional activity were alike in luciferase test (Fig. 2D).
In addition to the DNA-binding dependent gene activation, there
are DNA-binding independent mechanisms of gene regulation by
GR mostly mediated via negative interaction between GR and other
TFs, including NF-nB, AP-1, and p53 (10, 13, 14). Thus, in the next
set of experiments, we assessed how CpdA affected GR transrepression. For this, we used transient transfections of LNCaP-GR
cells with a panel of luciferase reporters that we used previously (7).
Remarkably, the activity of numerous TFs, including NF-nB, AP-1,
Ets-1, Elk-1, SRF, CRE, and NFATc, was reduced in LNCaP-GR cells

treated with CpdA for 32 h in comparison with control cells treated
only with the vehicle (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the comparison of
glucocorticoid FA and CpdA in luciferase assay revealed a
noteworthy similarity in the overall negative effect of those GR
ligands on TF activity: activity of most studied TFs ( five of seven)
was inhibited by both FA and CpdA in LNCaP-GR cells. The only
exceptions were AP-1 and NFATc factors, whose function was not
significantly affected by FA in LNCaP-GR cells at 32-h time point
when we measured luciferase activity. We further characterized
CpdA effects on NF-nB and AP-1 in other PC cells, as negative
interaction between GR and NF-nB and AP-1 is central for antiinflammatory and possibly for tumor suppressor effects of
glucocorticoids. In all GR-expressing prostate cells, CpdA inhibited
both basal and inducible NF-nB activity in luciferase test (Fig. 3A).
For NF-nB induction, we used transfection of PC cells with InB
kinase h (IKKh), an upstream activating kinase (40). In a similar
way, CpdA inhibited basal and IL-1–induced (Fig. 3) or TNF-a–
induced (data not shown) AP-1 activity in LNCaP-GR and PC3 cells.
The detailed analysis of nuclear translocation of major NF-nB
protein p65 in LNCaP-GR cells activated by TNF-a revealed that
p65 nuclear import was inhibited by CpdA (Fig. 3B). The similar
results were obtained for AP-1 subunit c-Jun in LNCaP-GR cells
activated by IL-1 (Fig. 3B; data not shown). These data suggest that
cytoplasm retention of NF-nB and AP-1 could be the leading
mechanism underlying CpdA-mediated inhibition of those factors
in prostate cells. Interestingly, the cytoplasm retention of NF-nB

and AP-1 was specific only to CpdA, as in cells treated with
glucocorticoid FA the nuclear import of those TFs was not altered
(Fig. 3B).
Altogether, these results indicate that CpdA combines properties
of antiandrogen and selective GR modulator that shifts GR activity
toward transrepression.
CpdA inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in PC cells.
We and others showed that AR blockage (by androgen ablation in
androgen-free medium) as well as activation of GR signaling,
especially GR-mediated transrepression, result in the inhibition of
PC cell growth (1–3, 6–9). This suggested that CpdA may also
possess a cytostatic potential in PC cells.
We indeed found that, in PC3, DU145, and parental LNCaP cells,
CpdA acted as a potent growth suppressor. The CpdA effective
concentrations were in the range of 10 5 to 10-6 mol/L
(Supplementary Data 3) that correlated well with the range of
concentrations that affected AR and GR function (see Fig. 2).
Remarkably, highly malignant androgen-independent DU145 and
PC3 cells seemed to be especially sensitive to CpdA: at the log
phase, their growth was inhibited by f70% to 90% compared with
the vehicle-treated control cells (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, the
cytostatic effect of CpdA in GR-expressing PC3 and DU145 cells
was much stronger than the effects of GR agonist glucocorticoid FA
and GR antagonist RU486 (data not shown).
In addition to experiments with monolayer cultures, we also
assessed the effect of CpdA on growth of LNCaP cells (LNCaP-V

translocation was assessed by immunofluorescence or Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts. HDAC-1 was used as a nuclear protein loading control.

Cytostatic and Apoptotic Effects of CpdA in PC Cells

or FA (10-6 mol/L) for 2 d. Nuclear extracts were used for Western blot analysis of PARP cleavage. C, evaluation of caspase activity after CpdA treatment by

cells infected with empty virus) in colony-forming assay. As shown
in Fig. 5B, CpdA significantly reduced anchorage-independent
growth of these PC cells.
To further evaluate cytotoxic potential of CpdA, we studied its
effect on survival of DU145 and PC3 cells that are resistant to
multiple proapoptotic stimuli (40). The analysis of the PARP
cleavage revealed that long-term exposure of cells to CpdA
(4–8 days) induced significant apoptosis (Fig. 4B). The treatment
of these cells with CpdA for 2 to 3 days did not induce apoptosis
per se but significantly sensitized DU145 and PC3 cells to TNF-a–
induced apoptosis (Fig. 4B; data not shown). Interestingly, the
apoptotic effect of CpdA was much more pronounced than the
effect of glucocorticoid FA (Fig. 4B). The apoptosis induced in
DU145 and PC3 cells by CpdA was caspase dependent: similar to
TNF-a, CpdA induced activity of several caspases, especially
caspase-2 and caspase-3 (Fig. 4C).

Cytostatic effect of CpdA depends on steroid receptor
expression. PC cells sensitive to CpdA have markedly different
phenotype in terms of the expression of steroid hormone receptors.
The most sensitive DU145 and PC3 express only GR, whereas
LNCaP cells with moderate sensitivity to CpdA express only AR. To
prove that GR plays an important role as a mediator of CpdA
toxicity, we performed two types of experiments. First, we
compared effect of CpdA in LNCaP cells stably infected with GRexpressing lentivirus and LNCaP cells infected with empty virus
(LNCaP-V). Importantly, LNCaP-GR cells appeared to be significantly more sensitive to growth inhibition by CpdA than LNCaP-V
cells both in monolayer and in colony-forming assay (Fig. 5).
Second, we inhibited GR expression by 70% to 80% in PC3 and
LNCaP-GR cells using siRNA approach (Fig. 6A and B). As shown
in Fig. 6, GR blockage has resulted in a drastic loss of sensitivity
to CpdA in both PC cell types.

To delineate AR role in CpdA effects, we have generated a clone
of androgen-independent LNCaP cells with low AR expression
(LNCaP-ARlow), which was derived from parental LNCaP cells
during selection in androgen-deprived medium. These cells are
analogous to previously reported androgen-independent LNCaP
clones (41). LNCaP-ARlow cells that express only residual amounts
of AR and no GR (data not shown) seemed almost completely
resistant to CpdA (Fig. 5A).
Finally, we used RWPE-1 prostate cells expressing very low levels
of AR and GR proteins (Supplementary Data 1). As shown in
Fig. 4A, these cells were the most resistant to the growth-inhibitory
effect of CpdA at all tested concentrations.
Overall, our results suggest an important role for both AR- and
GR-mediated signaling in the cytostatic effect of CpdA in PC
cells.

A large body of work published by different groups, including our
laboratory, suggests that signaling mediated via two closely related
steroid hormone receptors, AR and GR, plays opposite role in PC
formation. AR promotes PC development and growth at the stage
of hormone-dependent cancer, whereas GR acts as a tumor
suppressor in prostate (1–9, 16). Therefore, our study explores a
novel strategy for PC treatment through simultaneous inhibition of
protumorigenic and activation of antitumorigenic signaling
mediated by steroid hormone receptors using dual specificity
ligands that modulate activity of both AR and GR. One of the
potential candidates for such approach to PC treatment is CpdA, a
novel phyto-modulator of steroid hormone receptors (21, 23).
The chemical structure of CpdA significantly differs from most
known AR/GR antagonists and GR-dissociated ligands (11, 19,
27, 41, 42): CpdA is small molecule with only one benzene ring
(Fig. 1C). Using receptor ligand virtual docking analysis, we predict
that CpdA could bind to LBDs of both AR and GR at the binding
pockets of natural steroid ligands. Moreover, CpdA can form
H-bonds with the same amino acids that are involved in H-bond
formation during steroid binding (Fig. 1). These data suggest that
CpdA would compete with corresponding steroids for receptor
binding. Indeed, whole-cell binding assays revealed a strong
competition between CpdA and glucocorticoid Dex for endogenous
GR (Fig. 1D and ref. 23). The competition between androgens
and CpdA has not been found previously (21). However, our data
suggest that CpdA competes for AR binding with androgens,
although at a lesser extent than it competes with glucocorticoids
for GR (Fig. 1D). The difference in our results and previous data
in respect to CpdA binding to AR may reflect the significant
variations in experimental conditions, as Tanner and colleagues
performed whole-cell binding assay and incubated cell cultures
with a different radiolabeled androgen mibolerone for a short
period of time.
Using prostate cell lines with different status of receptor
expression, we found that CpdA induces nuclear translocation of
both receptors in PC cells. Nevertheless, it inhibits basal and
hormone-induced AR and GR DNA binding and gene transactivation. Remarkably, CpdA inhibits activity of numerous proproliferative and antiapoptotic TFs in a way similar to glucocorticoids. CpdA strongly inhibits growth of PC cells and induces
caspase-dependent apoptosis of highly malignant PC3 and DU145
cells that are resistant to many anticancer drugs. Cytostatic effects
of CpdA seemed to be AR and GR dependent.

Inhibitory effect of CpdA on hormone-induced AR transactivation reported here agrees with the results of previous studies
(21). In addition, in prostate cells, CpdA negatively affected AR in
the absence of hormone treatment (Fig. 2). Previously, Tanner and
colleagues (21) described mechanisms of AR down-regulation by
CpdA that included (a) altered interaction between AR and steroid
receptor coactivator SRC-1 and (b) inhibition of ligand-induced
interaction between NH2-terminal transactivation domain (AF1)
and COOH-terminal transactivation domain (AF2) essential for

normal AR function. These and our observations indicate that
mechanisms of action of CpdA and widely used antiandrogens
flutamide, Casodex, and cyproterone acetate are similar (Fig. 2B;
refs. 27, 31, 36, 39).
CpdA differentially affects transactivation and transrepression
functions of GR. Depending on the cell type, GR transactivation
was not changed or was decreased to a different degree by CpdA
(refs. 21, 23 and our work). Despite similarities in ligand properties
between CpdA and glucocorticoids revealed by virtual docking,

CpdA failed to induce effective GR nuclear translocation and
transactivation of GR (Fig. 2). This could possibly relate to inability
of CpdA to induce GR phosphorylation at Ser211, which is an
important step for GR nuclear translocation and transactivation by
agonists (23).
In contrast to its antagonism to glucocorticoids in terms of
inducing GR transactivation, CpdA was able to up-regulate GR
transrepression, mimicking this important mode of glucocorticoid
effects on transcription. We found that in all studied PC cells
expressing GR, both CpdA and glucocorticoid FA inhibited function
of several TFs, including NF-nB, AP-1, Ets-1, Elk-1, SRF, ATF/CRE,
and NFATc (Fig. 3). These results correlate well with the previous
observations that CpdA inhibited NF-nB–dependent gene expression in HEK293T and L929sA cells with endogenous and exogenous
GR (23). The expression of functional GR in cells was a prerequisite
for inhibition of NF-nB and other TFs by CpdA (ref. 23 and our not
shown data). Moreover, the analysis of specific GR domains that are
necessary for inhibition of NF-nB activity by CpdA has revealed the
importance of LBD as well as second zinc finger in DNA-binding
domain of GR (23). The same domains are critical for GR
transrepression induced by glucocorticoids (43, 44). Overall, these
findings strongly suggest that CpdA acts as a dissociated
glucocorticoid modifying GR properties and shifting its activity
toward transrepression.
Intriguingly, in prostate cells treated with cytokine TNF-a (Fig. 3)
or IL-1 (data not shown), CpdA prevented translocation of p65 and
c-Jun proteins into the nucleus. This indicates the important role of
NF-nB and AP-1 cytoplasm retention in the inhibition of activity of
these TFs specifically by CpdA, as nuclear translocation of these
proteins was not inhibited by glucocorticoid FA (Fig. 3). It is
possible that notably weaker nuclear import of GR induced by
CpdA compared with glucocorticoids (Fig. 2C) is responsible for
this NF-nB and AP-1 cytoplasm sequestration. The process of
hormone-induced nuclear translocation of GR is complex and
involves GR phosphorylation, substitution of protein partners in
GR-chaperone complex, and recruitment of transport protein
dynein (13, 44). As mentioned above, CpdA fails to induce GR
phosphorylation. Other effects of CpdA on these early steps of GR
activation remain to be investigated. However, our data suggest
that CpdA induces only partial changes in GR conformation that
are not fully sufficient for receptor nuclear translocation and its
DNA binding but at the same time are permissive for GR/p65 and
GR/c-Jun interaction in the cytoplasm. It is noteworthy that there
is experimental evidence that GR indeed interacts with p65/p50
NF-nB dimer in cytoplasm and affects NF-nB cytoplasm/nuclear
shuttling (reviewed in ref. 45).
One of the most important findings of this work is receptordependent strong cytostatic and apoptotic effects of CpdA in PC
cells especially in highly malignant DU145 and PC3 cells that are
resistant to many other growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic

compounds (reviewed in ref. 40). We are currently investigating
the molecular mechanisms underlying these cytostatic anticancer
effects of CpdA in PC cells using different approaches, including
gene arrays. Our working hypothesis is that the remarkable
cytostatic potential of CpdA in PC cells is a result of the inhibition
of numerous pro-proliferative and antiapoptotic TFs, such as
factors from the Ets family, NF-nB, and AP-1 combined with the
blocked defense response of cancer cells presumably mediated
via gene activation by steroid hormone receptors. Importantly,
neither glucocorticoids that are as potent as CpdA in inducing
GR transrepression nor GR/AR antagonist mifepristone (RU486;
refs. 7, 36) does not induce significant growth inhibition or apoptosis of PC3 and DU145 cells in vitro (Fig. 4 and data not shown).
It is currently well accepted that the anti-inflammatory
therapeutic effects of glucocorticoids are mostly mediated via
gene transrepression, whereas many side effects of glucocorticoids
are mediated via DNA-dependent transactivation (11). Our recent
studies have revealed the leading role of GR-mediated transrepression in its tumor suppressor effect in different cells, including
prostate (7, 16, 46). This ties anti-inflammatory and anticancer
effects of the GR signaling. Thus, selective GR modulators that
preferentially induce GR transrepression with improved therapeutic-to-side effect ratio have a great potential both as antiinflammatory and anticancer drugs. CpdA obviously represents
one of such compounds and acts as GR-dissociated ligand not only
in vitro but also in vivo. It was shown that CpdA possesses strong
anti-inflammatory activity in mice, but in comparison with
glucocorticoid, Dex does not induce such adverse effect as
hyperglycemia (23).
Overall, our results and literature data clearly indicate that
phyto-modulator of steroid hormone receptors CpdA has unique
combination of properties acting as anti-inflammatory antiandrogen with reduced side effects. Thus, CpdA itself or as a prototype of
novel class of multitarget steroid hormone receptor modulators
has a great potential for PC treatment.
