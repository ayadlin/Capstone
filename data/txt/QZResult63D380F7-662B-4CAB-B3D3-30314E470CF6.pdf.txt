Abstract
Adenoviruses have been clinically tested as anticancer therapies
but their utility has been severely limited by rapid, systemic
cytokine release and consequent inﬂammatory toxicity. Here,
we describe a new approach to tackling these dangerous side
effects. Using human ovarian cancer cell lines as well as malignant
epithelial cells harvested from the ascites of women with ovarian
cancer, we show that tumor cells do not produce cytokines in the
ﬁrst 24 hours following in vitro infection with the oncolytic
adenovirus dl922-947. In contrast, dl922-947 does induce inﬂammatory cytokines at early time points following intraperitoneal
delivery in mice with human ovarian cancer intraperitoneal
xenografts. In these animals, cytokines originate predominantly
in murine tissues, especially in macrophage-rich organs such as
the spleen. We use a nonreplicating adenovirus to conﬁrm that

early cytokine production is independent of adenoviral replication. Using b3 integrin knockout mice injected intraperitoneally
with dl922-947 and b3 null murine peritoneal macrophages, we
conﬁrm a role for macrophage cell surface b3 integrin in this
dl922-947–induced inﬂammation. We present new evidence that
co-administration of a cyclic RGD-mimetic–speciﬁc inhibitor of
b3 integrin signiﬁcantly attenuates the cytokine release and
inﬂammatory hepatic toxicity induced by dl922-947 in an intraperitoneal murine model of ovarian cancer. Importantly, we ﬁnd
no evidence that b3 inhibition compromises viral infectivity and
oncolysis in vitro or anticancer efﬁcacy in vivo. By enabling safe,
systemic delivery of replicating adenoviruses, this novel approach
could have a major impact on the future development of these
effective anticancer agents. Cancer Res; 75(14); 2811–21. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

viral ﬁber also bind cell surface integrins, predominantly avb3 and
avb5. Virions are internalized and transported along microtubules
to the nucleus where viral replication takes place. Oncolytic
viruses replicate selectively within cells with matched genetic
defects. E1A-CR2–deleted adenoviruses, including dl922-947
(9) and D24 (10), target cells with Rb checkpoint abnormalities,
a deﬁning feature of ovarian cancer (11, 12). In a recent phase I
trial, an E1A-CR2–deleted adenovirus induced stable disease in 14
of 19 patients with advanced gynecological cancers (13).
Ovarian cancer, in particular the high-grade serous subtype,
spreads by seeding across peritoneal surfaces, producing ascites
that is rich in macrophages and inﬂammatory cytokines. This local
inﬂammation has been implicated in tumor promotion (14), and
clinical trials have suggested that inhibition of the cytokine TNFa
may have therapeutic potential (15). We have shown that siltuximab (CNTO328), an inhibitory monoclonal antibody to another
cytokine, IL6, induces antitumor responses in patients with
relapsed ovarian cancer (16). Because tumor spread outside the
peritoneum is rare, ovarian cancer is amenable to therapies
delivered by the intraperitoneal route. In oncolytic virotherapy,
intraperitoneal rather than intravenous delivery can reduce systemic, cytokine-induced toxicity but local inﬂammation still
causes severe abdominal side effects (17). Although various
mechanisms have been described by which viruses initiate inﬂammation, the interplay between viruses and the microenvironment
of the peritoneal cavity in ovarian cancer is poorly understood and
the extent to which inﬂammation helps or hinders viral oncolytic
efﬁcacy remains unclear.

Oncolytic adenoviruses replicate selectively within infected
cancer cells, causing cell death. Viruses target immunity to infected
malignant cells, whereas oncolysis activates T cells by releasing
tumor-speciﬁc antigens (reviewed in refs. 1 and 2). The potential
of oncolytic adenoviruses as an anticancer therapy has repeatedly
been demonstrated and one virus, H101 (3), has been licensed in
China. A consistent and worrying feature of systemic viral therapy
is the cytokine release that occurs rapidly after viral administration. These cytokines cause dose-limiting inﬂammatory toxicities,
which can be severe (4–8) and have hindered further investigation
and clinical development of these promising anticancer agents.
During adenoviral infection, the viral ﬁber terminal knob
protein anchors cell surface coxsackie adenovirus receptor (CAR).

Browne et al.

We have previously shown that the replication-selective, E1ACR2–deleted adenovirus, dl922-947, has more potent anticancer
activity in vitro than wild-type (WT) adenovirus (18). In female
nude mice with intraperitoneal human ovarian cancer xenografts,
which recapitulate the cytokine and macrophage-rich peritoneal
environment of human ovarian cancer, survival was signiﬁcantly
prolonged by intraperitoneal dl922-947 but, similar to the human
experience with these agents, high levels of ascitic cytokines
(unpublished) and marked hepatic toxicity were observed (18).
We previously attempted to modulate these inﬂammatory side
effects by combining oncolytic adenovirus with inhibitors of
TNFa. Although this improved viral efﬁcacy, liver toxicity still
occurred (19).
In non–tumor-bearing mice, wild-type adenovirus 5 (Ad5-WT)
has been shown to promote inﬂammation via viral RGD motifs
binding b3 integrins on macrophages, including hepatic kupffer
cells and splenic marginal zone macrophages (20). Cytokine
expression was attenuated with an RGD-deleted adenovirus
(20). We now describe a novel, clinically applicable approach to
control the inﬂammatory side effects of oncolytic adenoviruses
through pharmacological inhibition of b3 integrins in ovarian
cancer. In line with the accumulated evidence from clinical trials,
we conﬁrm that oncolytic adenovirus causes rapid, systemic
cytokine induction in vivo. In agreement with previously published data, we observed that cytokines originated predominantly
in macrophage-rich supporting tissues rather than malignant
epithelial cells and that cytokine expression and release was
dependent on b3 integrins.
In a murine ovarian cancer model, we show for the ﬁrst time
that virus-induced systemic cytokines and hepatic toxicity can be
reduced by pharmacological inhibition of b3 with the cyclic RGDmimetic peptide, H2574, without compromising anticancer activity. H2574, also described as EMD 66203, c(RGDfV), is widely
used preclinically as a speciﬁc inhibitor of b3 integrins. H2574
inhibits binding of vitronectin to avb3 integrin with an IC50 of
0.0025, whereas inhibition of avb5 is minimal (reviewed in
ref. 21). We used H2574 to maximize the clinical applicability
of our ﬁndings because its N-methylated analogue, cilengitide
[EMD 121974, c(RGD-N(Me)V-], is already in clinical use. In
contrast to H2574, cilengitide does have inhibitory activity for
avb5 but this is still more than 100-fold lower than that for avb3
(IC50 ¼ 140 nmol/L compared with 1 nmol/L for avb3; ref. 22).
The novel pharmacological approach we describe here should
enable the safe delivery of many viral anticancer agents and thus
facilitate further clinical testing of many more of these promising
therapies.

Cell lines, viruses, and chemicals
SKOV3ip1 cells (23) were obtained from Cancer Research UK
(Clare Hall, UK). OVCAR4 (24) were obtained from Dr. R.
Camalier (NCI-Frederick, MD). Murine WT, b3 and hb3þ endothelial cells were transformed with Polyoma Middle T Antigen
(obtained from Dr. S. Robinson, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK; ref. 25). SKOV3ip1 and OVCAR4 cells were cultured in
DMEM plus 1% penicillin and streptomycin and 10% FCS and
underwent 16 locus STR veriﬁcation (DNA Diagnostics Centre,
London, UK; June 10, 2014). Immortalized endothelial cells were
grown in 1:1 DMEM (low glucose) and Ham's F12 containing

dl922-947 (9) and dlCR2-pIX-dsRed (26) are already described.
Ad-GFP is an E1-deleted, nonreplicating, type-5 adenovirus,
expressing GFP under the CMV promoter. H2574 was purchased
from Bachem. Cell survival was assessed by MTT assay (18).
RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and quantitative-PCR
Cultured cells and 30 mg murine tissue were lyzed with
TRIzol (Invitrogen) and homogenized by pipetting (cultured
cells) or with a T25 Ultratissue homogenizer (tissue). After 5minute incubation at room temperature, 200 mL chloroform
was added per 1 mL of TRIzol. Samples were mixed, incubated
(2 minutes, room temperature), and centrifuged (15 minutes,
1,400 rpm, 4 C). RNA was precipitated from the aqueous
upper phase with 500 mL isopropanol at 20 C for 20
minutes. The sample was then applied to a RNeasy mini
column (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One microgram of RNA was reverse transcribed using
the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies; 25 C, 10 minutes; 37 C, 120 minutes; 85 C, 5
minutes). cDNA was subjected to qPCR using Taqman Gene
Expression Assay primers (Life Technologies). Expression was
normalized to 18s RNA.
Protein extraction and cytokine ELISA
Cell supernatants were collected over time after adenovirus.
Tissues were lyzed in 600 mL lysis buffer (150 mmol/L NaCl, 20
mmol/L TrisBase, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1% Tritin X100) with Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets (Roche
Diagnostics) and homogenized with a T25 Ultra tissue homogenizer. After 30-minute incubation on ice, samples were centrifuged (15 minutes, 13,000 rpm, 4 C) and protein in the lower
liquid phase diluted to 5 mg/mL. Cytokines were measured using
the Mesoscale Discovery System multiplex plates (Mesoscale
Discovery).
Immunoﬂuorescence
Cells were grown on poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips and ﬁxed in
3.7% formaldehyde (10 minutes, room temperature). Cells were
washed, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton for 10 minutes, and then
blocked in 10% goat serum (1 hour, room temperature). Cells were
incubated with primary antibody [EpCam 1:500 (AbCam
ab20160)] for 1 hour at room temperature in 0.2% PBSTweenþ3% BSA, washed and then incubated with secondary
antibody [Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes;
Invitrogen)] for 1 hour at room temperature. Coverslips were
stained with DAPI (Invitrogen) and mounted onto glass slides.
Viral internalization in murine peritoneal macrophages: PCR
Peritoneal macrophages were harvested from WT and b3/
mice as described in animal models. A total of 5  105 murine
peritoneal cells were seeded in 6-cm plates. After overnight
incubation, cells were washed in cold RPMI þ 1% BSA and
infected with dl922-947 (MOI 10) on ice for 1 hour. Unbound
virus was removed by washing in cold RPMI. Cells were then
incubated at 37 C for 1 hour. DNA was harvested from cell pellets
using a QIampDNA Extraction Kit (Qiagen). Hexon was quantiﬁed by qPCR against a standard curve of viral particles (50 GGTGGCCATTACCTTTGACTCT-30 , 30 -GGGTAAGCAGGCGGTCATT-50 , probe: [6FAM]CTGTCAGCTGGCCTGG [TAM]).

b3 Inhibitor Reduces Oncolytic Adenoviral Inﬂammatory Toxicity

Viral internalization in murine peritoneal macrophages:
confocal microscopy
Peritoneal macrophages were harvested from WT and b3/
mice as described in Animal Models. A total of 5  105 murine
peritoneal cells were seeded overnight on poly-L-lysine coated
coverslips. After overnight incubation, cells were washed in cold
RPMI þ 1% BSA and infected with dlCR2-pIX-dsRed (50,000 vp/
cell) on ice for 1 hour. Unbound virus was removed by washing in
cold RPMI. Cells were ﬁxed in cold 95% ethanol and 5% acetic
acid (10 minutes, room temperature) or the infection was continued at 37 C for a further 1 hour prior to washing and ﬁxing.
Fixed cells were blocked with 3% BSA for 30 minutes and then
incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes in anti-CD11bAlexaFluor488 (1:100; eBioscience). Cells were stained with DAPI
(1:10,000; 1 mg/mL; Invitrogen), washed, and mounted onto
glass slides.
Confocal microscopy
Confocal was performed with an inverted Zeiss LSM 510 META
laser-scanning microscope with a Plan Apochromat 63/1.4 Oil
objective. DAPI was detected with a 405 nm laser. Alexa Fluor 488
with a 488 nm laser and dsRed with a 543 nm laser. Images were
acquired in the x-, y-, and z-direction with a line average of 4. Zsections were acquired at optimum interval levels with sections of
0.43 mm. maximal intensity Z-projections were assembled with
the LSM5 Image browser software.
Flow cytometry in murine peritoneal cells
Peritoneal macrophages were harvested from WT and b3/
mice as described in Animal Models. For adenoviral receptors,
cells were blocked with Fc fragments for 15 minutes before
addition of conjugated antibodies [CAR-PE (Millipore), b3-PE
(eBioscience), b5-PE (eBioscience), and IgG-PE (eBioscience)] in
PBS þ 1% BSA for 1 hour on ice in the dark. Samples were
analyzed on a BD FACSCalibur (BectonDickinson).
To quantify macrophage cell surface markers using multichannel ﬂow cytometry, cells were incubated with a viability dye
(eBioscience) for 30 minutes in the dark on ice and then blocked
with Fc fragments for 15 minutes. Conjugated antibodies [CD45FITC (eBioscience), CD11b-eFluor450 (eBioscience), mMR-PE/
CD206 (BioLegend), Ly-6C-APC (eBioscience), Ly-6G-AlexaFluor700 (eBioscience), CsfR1/CD115 (eBioscience), and F4/
80-PE-Cy5 (eBioscience)] were added for 15 minutes on ice in
the dark. Cells were washed and ﬁxed in 2% formaldehyde.
Samples were analyzed on a BD LSRFortessa (BectonDickinson).
Animal models
Experiments complied with National Cancer Research Institute guidelines and were conducted under UK government
Home Ofﬁce personal (70/19,108) and project (70/7,263)
licenses. Local approval was obtained from Queen Mary
University of London (PAC60-3). b3/ mice (B6.129S2Itgb3tm1Hyn/JSemJ) and WT controls (obtained from Prof K.
Hodivala-Dilke, Barts Cancer Institute, London, United Kingdom;
ref. 27) were bred in-house and used between 6 and 8 weeks old.
Intraperitoneal ovarian cancer xenografts were created by inoculating 5  106 SKOV3ip1 cells intraperitoneally in 6-week-old
CD1nu/nu female mice. For most experiments, 1010 particles
of dl922-947 were injected intraperitoneally in 400 mL PBS. For
virus efﬁcacy, dl922-947 (5  109 particles) was injected daily for
5 days in 400 mL PBS. Five milligrams of H2574 was dissolved in

www.aacrjournals.org

DMSO, diluted in H2O, and then injected intraperitoneally (total
volume 400 mL) or into an Alzet pump (Cupertino; total volume
210 mL). Alzet pumps were inserted subcutaneously and removed
2 weeks later under isoﬂuorane inhalation anesthesia. Mice were
assessed for weight, general health, and accumulation of ascites
and were killed according to UK Home Ofﬁce guidelines.
At necropsy, murine peritoneal macrophages were harvested
by peritoneal lavage with 10 mL cold PBS. Samples were treated
with Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer (Sigma-Aldrich), washed, and
cultured in RPMI, 1% penicillin and streptomycin, and 10%
FCS. Murine blood was obtained by cardiac puncture. Serum
liver function was analyzed at the Royal Veterinary College
(Hertfordshire, UK) and cytokines were quantiﬁed with the
Mesoscale Discovery System. Murine tissue was macrodissected
at postmortem and either snap frozen in liquid nitrogen or
ﬁxed in 10% formaldehyde. Four-micrometer sections were cut
from formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded tissues. All pathology
and immunohistochemistry slides were interpreted and scored
by a pathologist "blind" to the experimental groups.
Patient samples
Patient samples were collected with informed consent, via the
Barts Gynae Tissue Bank (Research Ethics Committee: 10/H0304/
14). Ascites was obtained from women with ovarian cancer
undergoing therapeutic drainage at St Bartholomew's Hospital
(London, UK). Ascites was centrifuged (500  g, 15 minutes) and
supernatant stored at 80 C. Cells were cultured in RPMI and
25% autologous supernatant.
Statistical analysis
Prism 6.0 (GraphPad) was used for statistical analysis. Data are
presented as mean  SD throughout and the unpaired t test was
used for all experiments except for analysis of changes over time
for which two-way ANOVA was used. P < 0.05 is considered
statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Oncolytic adenovirus does not induce early cytokine
production in ovarian cancer cells
To explore the kinetics of early adenovirus-induced cytokine
release, we used SKOV3ip1 cells (high b3, low CAR), because we
had previously shown that these cells can produce high levels of
TNFa and IL6 (19). Cytokine production by SKOV3ip1 cells was
negligible for the ﬁrst 24 hours after dl922-947 infection (Fig. 1A
and B). Infecting cells with Ad5-WT or higher viral doses did not
increase cytokine protein release compared with dl922-947 MOI
10 (Supplementary Fig. S1). To demonstrate that this observation
was not unique, we evaluated another ovarian cancer cell line:
OVCAR4 (high b3, moderate CAR). We again found no increase in
cytokines in the ﬁrst 24 hours (Fig. 1A and B). We also investigated
tumor cells harvested from the ascites of two women with (highgrade serous) ovarian cancer (Fig. 1C). In these ascitic cells,
transcription of IL6, IL8, and TNFa did not increase above
baseline for the ﬁrst 24 hours after ex vivo infection with dl922947 (Fig. 1D).
Oncolytic adenovirus induces cytokines in murine tissues at
early time points.
To model the adenovirus-induced inﬂammatory response
in more clinically relevant models, we created intraperitoneal

increased in the blood within 1 hour (Fig. 2A). Using speciesspeciﬁc reagents, we found that circulating cytokines originated
predominantly in murine tissues rather than the human xenografted SKOV3ip1 cells. This was true for all cytokines (Fig. 2A). To
determine the origin of these cytokines, mRNA was quantiﬁed in
excised tissues. Although adenovirus did not induce early cytokine
release in SKOV3ip1 cells in vitro, human cytokine mRNA was
identiﬁed in intraperitoneal SKOV3ip1 tumors (Fig. 2B). In a
separate experiment, cytokine mRNA correlated closely with
cytokine protein isolated from the same intraperitoneal tumors
(Supplementary Fig. S2). This suggests that cytokine production
by tumor cells is enhanced by interaction with the tumor stroma

2814 Cancer Res; 75(14) July 15, 2015

or in this case the murine component of the xenograft. Tumor
stroma appears also to be an important source of inﬂammatory
cytokines since murine cytokine mRNA in excised tumors
exceeded human mRNA for several cytokines (IL6, IL10, and
TNFa; Fig. 2B). Murine spleen and liver were also rich sources
of inﬂammatory cytokines. Although the proﬁles of individual
cytokines differed in the two organs, cytokines peaked in both
spleen and liver at 3 hours and had largely returned to baseline 24
hours after adenovirus (Fig. 2C and D).
Cytokine induction correlates with viral presence
The adenoviral replication cycle takes at least 24 hours and is
severely attenuated in murine cells (28, 29). Our observations that
in vivo cytokine release originates in murine tissue and occurs at
early time points following intraperitoneal injection imply that
adenovirus-induced cytokine release is independent of viral

replication. To test this, cytokines were analyzed following a
single intraperitoneal injection of a nonreplicating virus (Ad-GFP,
1010 particles) in mice with mature intraperitoneal SKOV3ip1
xenografts. In the circulation (Fig. 3A), and spleen (Fig. 3B),
murine cytokine levels were signiﬁcantly greater following AdGFP compared with PBS control. All circulating cytokines tested
peaked 6 hours after intraperitoneal injection. Likewise, splenic
cytokine production also increased over the ﬁrst 6 hours, suggesting that adenoviral replication is not responsible for inducing
cytokines in murine tissues at early time points.
To explore this further, spleen and tumor were analyzed by
immunohistochemistry following a single dose of dl922-947 in
mice bearing SKOV3ip1 xenografts (Fig. 3C and D). E1A is the ﬁrst
adenoviral protein to be expressed. As expected, we only found
E1A expression in human tumor tissues and never in murine
tissues (Fig. 3Ci). In contrast to cytokines, which were ﬁrst seen at
1 hour and had resolved by 24 hours, E1A was ﬁrst identiﬁed at 6
hours (Fig. 3Cii) and persisted for up to a week (Fig. 3Ciii and
Supplementary Fig. S3). Hexon, the major structural protein of the
adenoviral coat is indicative of viral presence rather than active
replication. In the spleen, discrete hexon staining was ﬁrst seen 1
hour postadenoviral injection (Fig. 3Di). By 3 hours, the staining
was more diffuse and widespread (Fig. 3Dii) and by 12 hours it
had resolved (Fig. 3Diii) mirroring the kinetics of cytokine release.

These ﬁndings suggest that cytokines are induced by adenoviral
presence rather than replication.
Cytokine induction by oncolytic adenovirus is
b3 integrin–dependent
In non–tumor-bearing mice, WT adenovirus induces cytokines
via b3 integrin–expressing macrophages (20). Having shown that
marked cytokine production occurs in macrophage-rich tissues
such as liver and spleen, we explored the role of b3 integrins
following oncolytic adenovirus in the malignant setting. First, we
injected WT and b3/ mice with a single dose of dl922-947
intraperitoneally (1010 particles). Immunohistochemistry identiﬁed hexon in the spleens of WT mice 3 hours postinjection (Fig.
4A). In contrast, no hexon was identiﬁed in the spleens of b3/
animals (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S4). Cytokine transcription was signiﬁcantly higher in the spleens of WT compared with
b3/ mice (Fig. 4B), indicating that b3-mediated viral uptake
induces splenic cytokine transcription. This was most marked for
IL1b (P < 0.05), IL6 (P < 0.05), and TNFa (P < 0.001). There was
no difference in baseline circulating cytokines in the two genotypes, but adenovirus-induced cytokines were signiﬁcantly higher
in the circulation of WT compared with b3/ animals (P < 0.05
IL1b and IL6; P < 0.01 TNFa; Fig. 4C). Although cytokine induction was attenuated in b3/ compared with WT animals, some

cytokines were induced in b3/ mice, most notably keratinocyte
chemoattractant (KC: murine homologue of IL8), conﬁrming that
b3 is not the only mediator of the virus-induced inﬂammatory
response.
Because ovarian cancer is predominantly a disease of the
peritoneum, we investigated peritoneal cells in WT and b3/
mice. In both genotypes, these cells showed strong expression of
CD11b (WT: 70.1  13.1% of live cells, b3/: 76.1  12.6%) and
F4/80 (WT: 51.3  14.9% of live cells, b3/: 51.9  6.8%),
indicating that they were predominantly macrophages (Fig. 5A).
As expected, expression of b3 was signiﬁcantly higher in peritoneal
cells from WT compared with b3/ mice (P < 0.001) but b5 and
CAR were negligible in both genotypes (Fig. 5B). Peritoneal
cells were infected ex vivo with dl922-947 or vehicle and cytokine
production measured 6 hours later (Fig. 5C). With the exception
of KC, in both genotypes the addition of virus signiﬁcantly
increased cytokine production compared with control (WT:
IL6, P < 0.01; IL1b, IL-10, TNFa, P < 0.001; and b3/: IL10,
P < 0.01; IL1b, IL6, TNFa, P < 0.001). However, release of all
cytokines over time following adenovirus was signiﬁcantly attenuated in b3/ compared with WT cells (IL6, P < 0.01; IL1b, KC,
IL10, TNFa, P < 0.001).

2816 Cancer Res; 75(14) July 15, 2015

We then tested whether cytokine release could be reduced by
pharmacological inhibition of b3 integrin. Peritoneal cells from
WT mice were treated ex vivo with dl922-947 together with the
cyclic RDG-mimetic inhibitor of b3 integrin, H2574. The addition
of H2574 caused a signiﬁcant reduction in IL1b (P < 0.05), IL10 (P
< 0.001), and TNFa (P < 0.001) 6 hours posttreatment (Fig. 5D).
b3 integrin is not essential for adenoviral cytotoxicity
avb3 and avb5 integrins are known to act as secondary receptors
during adenoviral infection. Pharmacological inhibition of these
integrins might therefore have the undesirable effect of reducing
adenoviral infectivity and thus anticancer activity. In murine
peritoneal cells infected ex vivo with dl922-947, PCR for adenoviral hexon showed that, whereas adenovirus was internalized by
b3/ cells, this was lower than in WT cells (Fig. 6A). To explore
this, we used a ﬂuorescent capsid-labeled adenovirus, dlCR2-pIXdsRed (26) and demonstrated adenovirus at the cell surface after
infection at 4 C followed by viral internalization when cells were
warmed to 37 C in both genotypes (Fig. 6B).
Next we tested whether integrins were required for adenoviral
cytotoxicity in murine peritoneal cells from b3/ and WT mice
(Fig. 6C). We also used immortalized endothelial cells from b3/

and WT mice, as well as immortalized endothelial cells created
from b3/ mice, which overexpress human b3 (hb3þ; Fig. 6D). In
all cells, cytotoxicity was not inﬂuenced by b3 integrin expression.
We then investigated whether b3 inhibition reduced adenoviral
cytotoxicity in human cancer cells. Two ovarian cancer cell lines
with high b3 integrin expression, SKOV3ip1 (low CAR) and

OVCAR4 (moderate CAR), were treated with dl922-947 together
with H2574. The addition of H2574 did not impair viral cytotoxicity in either cell line (Fig. 6E). Together, these experiments
conﬁrm that inhibition of adenoviral uptake was not a concern,
supporting further testing of the dl922-947 and H2574 combination in vivo.

b3 inhibition reduces adenoviral inﬂammatory toxicity in a
murine model of ovarian cancer
Female CD1nu/nu mice with SKOV3ip1 xenografts were treated with a single intraperitoneal dose of dl922-947 (1010 particles)
and H2574 (5 mg). In a separate experiment, mice received our
standard therapeutic viral dosing regimen of 109 particles intraperitoneally daily for 5 days (18), together with a subcutaneous
pump infusing H2574 (5 mg/2 weeks). Vehicle controls were used
for all experiments. In the single-dose experiment, mice were
sacriﬁced 6 hours after treatment, whereas mice with subcutaneous pumps were sacriﬁced either at 4 weeks or when they reached
UK Home Ofﬁce endpoint. At 6 hours, cytokine levels were lower
in mice that had received H2574, reaching statistical signiﬁcance
for all cytokines by 4 weeks (Fig. 7A).
To determine whether this H2574-induced reduction in circulating cytokines correlated with diminished inﬂammatory toxicities, livers were examined. As early as 6 hours postinjection,
eosinophilic degeneration, indicative of viral hepatotoxicity, was
apparent in dl922-947–treated mice but not in mice treated with
dl922-947 and H2574 combined (Fig. 7B). Liver function tests
upheld this observation as both bilirubin and alanine transam-

inase were reduced by co-administration of dl922-947 with
H2574 (Fig. 7C), although this did not reach statistical signiﬁcance. This experiment was not powered to detect differences in
survival. However, as an indication of antitumor efﬁcacy, we
weighed all residual peritoneal tumor in the small number of
mice that reached legal limits. In accordance with our in vitro
ﬁndings, the combination of dl922-947 and H2574 did not
reduce anticancer efﬁcacy compared with dl922-947 alone
(Fig. 7D).

Discussion
Systemic inﬂammation induced by oncolytic adenoviruses is a
major limitation to the clinical development of these promising
anticancer agents. Here we show in primary malignant cells,
ovarian cancer cells lines, genetically modiﬁed mice and ovarian
cancer xenografts that the oncolytic adenovirus, dl922-947, causes
rapid induction of inﬂammatory cytokines that originate primarily in macrophage-rich host tissues. We conﬁrm that cytokine
release and the associated inﬂammatory hepatic toxicity is b3
integrin–dependent and show here for the ﬁrst time that these

toxicities can be controlled by pharmacological inhibition of b3
integrins without obviously compromising anticancer efﬁcacy.
Ovarian cancer is characterized by a tumor-promoting network
of cytokines (14). We previously showed that oncolytic adenoviruses, including dl922-947, induce TNFa in ovarian cancer cells
between 24 and 72 hours (19). However, the clinical experience
with systemic adenovirus suggests that cytokine release occurs
much earlier (5, 6). Most notably, in one highly publicized death,
the patient had already developed advanced symptoms of systemic inﬂammation 18 hours after virus administration and
interestingly, serum TNFa was not initially elevated (4). When
we inhibited TNFa with RNAi or with anti-TNFa antibodies in
murine ovarian cancer xenografts, virus-induced hepatic toxicity
was not reduced (19). These observations imply that clinically
problematic inﬂammation occurs early after systemic virus and
that TNFa may not be the initiating cytokine.
In ovarian cancer cell lines in vitro, we did not observe an
increase in cytokines in the ﬁrst 24 hours following adenovirus. In
contrast, the very early cytokine production seen in murine
xenografts more accurately reproduced the human experience
and was associated with the inﬂammatory hepatotoxicity and
elevation of liver enzymes that is well described following adenovirus infection (30–33). The differences we observed in ovarian
cancer cells in vitro and in vivo implicate tumor/stroma interactions
in the initiation of this inﬂammatory response. In support of this,
adenoviral induction of proinﬂammatory cytokines has been

www.aacrjournals.org

shown to be augmented when malignant epithelial cells are
cocultured with macrophages in vitro (34). In tumor-bearing mice
we found that virus-induced cytokines arose predominantly in
murine tissues rather than the implanted human tumor cells. The
cell types that are responsible for innate responses to adenovirus
such as macrophages and dendritic cells (33, 35, 36) are present at
high levels in liver, spleen, and peritoneum and are therefore
likely to be a major source of the systemic inﬂammatory cytokines
reported here.
Our ﬁnding that adenoviral cytokine induction is not dependent on viral replication and gene expression is also in keeping
with a large body of evidence, acquired in non–tumor-bearing
organisms, implicating a range of potential viral sensors as initiators of the innate immune response (20, 37, 38). In addition to the
interaction of viral RGD with b3 integrins previously reported with
Ad5-WT in the nonmalignant setting (20), internalized viral DNA
is sensed by toll-like receptors, which stimulate dendritic cells and
macrophages to release type I interferon. Viral DNA has also been
shown to cause an inﬂammatory response in macrophages via
maturation of IL1b within a cytosolic complex known as the
inﬂammasome (38).
The existence of these varied mechanisms explains our observation that, although inhibition of b3 integrins reduces inﬂammatory cytokine release, it does not completely abrogate the
cytokine response. Nonetheless, the interaction between adenoviral coat RGD and b3 integrins on the macrophage surface is

particularly attractive for targeted therapeutic manipulation.
Mutant RGD adenoviruses have been used to abrogate viral
binding to b3 integrin (20), but the need to create RGD mutant
versions of all clinically applicable oncolytic adenoviruses is
problematic in terms of clinical development. Others have
attempted to manipulate the inﬂammatory response with immunosuppressive agents such as cyclophosphamide (39) and cyclosporine (40). Both of these drugs have myriad other effects,
including a paradoxical immunostimulatory effect of cyclophosphamide (41). Pharmacological inhibition of integrins offers a
more speciﬁc, versatile, and clinically applicable strategy that
could be applied to a range of viral agents.
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst investigation of a speciﬁc
pharmacological strategy to inhibit integrin binding and the ﬁrst
evaluation of this approach in murine cancer models. Given the
role of avb3 as a secondary adenoviral receptor, we were reassured
to ﬁnd that b3 null cells could still be infected and that oncolysis
was not impaired by the absence of b3. In ovarian cancer, which is
largely a disease of the peritoneum, our demonstration of a
reduction in cytokine production by b3 null murine peritoneal
cells is particularly clinically relevant.
avb3 is upregulated on tumor blood vessels (42). Several drugs
targeting this pathway are currently undergoing testing as anticancer therapies (43) and cilengitide, the most widely studied
inhibitor of avb3 (44), has shown some clinical activity in glioblastoma (45, 46). In ovarian cancer, a small case series identiﬁed
b3 integrin expression in normal ovarian epithelium and lowgrade tumors but in poorly differentiated cancers, expression was
lost (47). In another series, b3 integrin was associated with a
favorable prognosis in ovarian cancer (48) and because more than
80% of human ovarian tumors are high grade, poor prognostic
malignancies, it is not surprising that cilengitide has not been
clinically tested in ovarian cancer.
In this ﬁrst report of combination therapy with an oncolytic
adenovirus and H2574, a cilengitide-like inhibitor of b3
integrin, we signiﬁcantly reduced the inﬂammatory cytokines
and hepatotoxicity caused by systemic adenovirus. Importantly, in vitro and in the small numbers of mice tested, the
anticancer activity of dl922-947 did not appear to be compromised by the addition of H2574. In summary, oncolytic

adenoviruses have proven anticancer activity and combination with b3 integrin inhibitors could enable safer delivery
and facilitate further clinical development of these promising
agents.
