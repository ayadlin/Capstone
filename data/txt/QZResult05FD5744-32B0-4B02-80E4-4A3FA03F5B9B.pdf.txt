BACKGROUND: Despite definitive surgery, the survival of patients with high-risk urothelial carcinoma (UC)
is poor. Adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy may be beneficial, but it is restricted by the need for normal renal function (RF). Sequential administration of adjuvant chemotherapy facilitates drug delivery and
improves survival in patients with breast cancer. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility
and survival impact of adjuvant, sequential chemotherapy in patients with high-risk UC. METHODS: Fifty
patients were treated on 2 simultaneous protocols between 1997 and 2004. The patients on Protocol A
(normal RF) received doxorubicin and gemcitabine (AG) followed by paclitaxel and cisplatin. The patients
on Protocol B (impaired RF) received AG followed by paclitaxel plus carboplatin. Overall survival (OS) and
disease-specific survival (DSS) were compared with a group of 203 contemporary control patients who
had similar pathology and RF and who underwent surgery alone. RESULTS: The median follow-up of protocol patients was 6.5 years (range, 0.9-8.6 years), and 25 patients remained alive. The median follow-up of
the control group was 4.7 years (0.0-9.2), and 68 patients remained alive. The median OS for patients on
Protocol A was greater than that for controls who had good RF (4.6 years vs 2.5 years; P ¼ .03). The median OS for patients on Protocol B was greater than that for controls who had impaired RF (3.4 years vs
2 years; P ¼ .04). DSS for the protocol and matched control groups was similar (good RF: 4.6 years vs
3 years; P ¼ .24; impaired RF: 3.4 years vs 3.3 years; P ¼ .40). CONCLUSIONS: In this nonrandomized study,
adjuvant, sequential chemotherapy for patients with high-risk UC did not improve DSS over that observed

muscularis mucosa, for which the standard surgical treatment is radical cystectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy. With surgery alone, there is a high rate of
recurrence; and, ultimately 20% to 30% of patients with
pathologic T2 (pT2) tumors, 40% to 60% of patients
with pT3 tumors, and 70% to 90% of patients with pT4
tumors will develop distant metastases.2 Five-year survival
rates after cystectomy of 36% to 48% have been reported,
and worse survival has been reported in the range of 25%
to 35% for patients with extravesical disease.3-6
High-risk patients frequently receive perioperative
chemotherapy that targets micrometastases to reduce the
risk of recurrence. Several clinical trials and 3 meta-analyses have demonstrated a survival benefit for neoadjuvant
chemotherapy with an approximate 5% absolute
improvement in overall survival (OS) at 5 years.7-12 Six
studies investigating adjuvant chemotherapy in UC have
been published. Two studies demonstrated a survival benefit, and 4 did not. All 6 trials have been criticized for
methodological flaws.13-18 Nonetheless, a 25% relative
decrease in the risk of death for adjuvant therapy compared with no therapy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-0.96; P ¼ .02) was suggested
in 1 meta-analysis, although that study was limited by size
(n ¼ 491) and the poor quality of trial data on which it
was based.19 That meta-analysis did not include the largest trial ever performed, which recently reported no benefit with immediate adjuvant chemotherapy for patients
with UC.18
Mathematical models long have formed the basis of
chemotherapy development. The Skipper-SchabelWilcox model introduced in 1871 established combination chemotherapy based on the premise that each dose of
chemotherapeutic agent kills a constant fraction of tumor
and that multiple drugs are required to kill cells with heterogeneous sensitivity. The ‘‘log-kill’’ theory assumed a
constant and exponential growth pattern and proposed
that cure could be achieved by exposing sensitive cells to a
sufficient duration of treatment. This hypothesis worked
for leukemia, because the growth dynamics of the cancer
are constant.20
However, many tumors do not grow exponentially
and, instead, fit a growth pattern described by Gompertz
whereby tumor doubling time increases with tumor size.
Norton and Simon expanded on this theory and hypothesized that the fraction of cells killed falls as the number of
5194

cells increases.21 They proposed that, between doses of
chemotherapy, small tumors grow more quickly, relative
to their size, than larger tumors; and the authors suggested
that increasing dose density would minimize the opportunity for regrowth between cycles. Sequential administration of chemotherapy achieves this aim.
Only cisplatin-based regimens have demonstrated
benefit in the perioperative treatment of UC, a disease
with a median age of 68 years at diagnosis. The glomerular filtration rate deteriorates with age, and many patients
have comorbid medical illnesses that further compromise
renal function (RF). Poor RF limits the administration of
cisplatin, and it is not known whether carboplatin is as
effective in the adjuvant setting. For metastatic disease,
small phase 2 studies evaluating carboplatin regimens
have reported similar response rates with less toxicity but
with shorter median survival than typically is observed
with cisplatin-based regimens.22-24
At Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
(MSKCC) between 1997 and 2004, we tested the feasibility and outcomes of dose-dense, sequential, adjuvant
chemotherapy using 2 prospective phase 2 protocols.
Both protocols had similar eligibility criteria with the
exception of RF, and RF decided which platinum was
used. Herein, we report the toxicity, OS, and disease-specific survival (DSS) of these 2 studies compared with contemporary controls who had similar pathology and RF
and who underwent cystectomy and lymphadenectomy
but who did not receive perioperative chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria
Our study population included patients with complete
resection of locally advanced UC with negative margins, histologically confirmed by the Pathology Service at MSKCC.
Pathologic stages included Tany,Nþ,M0; T3b,N0,M0;
T4a,N0,M0 for the bladder. For UC of the renal pelvis or
ureter, pathologic stages included Tany,Nþ,M0;
T3,N0,M0; and T4,N0,M0. Patients on Protocol A had
normal RF (serum creatinine <1.5 mg/dL or calculated creatinine clearance 60 mL/minute using the Cockroft-Gault
equation). Patients on Protocol B had impaired RF (serum
creatinine >1.5 mg/dL but 2.5mg/dL and calculated creatinine clearance <60 mL/minute but >30 mL/minute), or

evidence of another active cancer, or previous chemotherapy or irradiation to the bladder. Both protocols were
approved by the Memorial Hospital Institutional Review
Board (IRB), and all patients provided written consent
before enrollment. A waiver of approval from the IRB was
obtained for analysis of the control group.
Treatment
All patients started treatment with AG. Eighteen of
50 patients received gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 weekly for

6 weeks followed by doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 biweekly for
8 weeks. Because of the extensive time required for this
initial component of treatment (14 weeks), the schedule
was optimized to a 10-week schedule in both protocols by
giving both drugs simultaneously with doxorubicin
50 mg/m2 and gemcitabine 2000 mg/m2 every other
week for 5 cycles (AG) with granulocyte-colony–stimulating factor (G-CSF) support after each dose. After 5 cycles
of AG, patients on Protocol A received 4 cycles of paclitaxel 150 mg/m2 as a 3-hour infusion plus cisplatin either
at 1 dose of 60 mg/m2 or at a dose of 20 mg/m2 daily for 3
days every 14 days. Patients on Protocol B received AG
for 5 cycles followed by 12 weekly cycles of paclitaxel
65 mg/m2 plus carboplatin (area under the curve, 1.7).
G-CSF was used in both arms. Attempts were made to
treat all patients within 3 months of surgery. Both studies
were pilot trials and were designed to estimate the feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of dose-dense adjuvant
chemotherapy. Protocol A was a phase 1/2 study that was
planned to accrue up to 55 patients, depending on the
number of patients who were treated on the phase 1 portion. This number was estimated to allow a noncomparative estimation of efficacy with 95% CIs of 20%. Only
30 patients were accrued on this study. Protocol B was a
phase 2 study that was planned to accrue up to 45
patients. If neutropenic fever was observed in <5 patients,
then we could be 95% confident that the true incidence of
a major toxicity was <7%. Only 20 patients were accrued
to this study. To enable a clinically meaningful comparison, we combined the 2 protocols and compared those

patients with MSKCC patients who had pathology and
RF similar to those of the patients who were on the
protocol that included surgery but no perioperative chemotherapy during the same period as the ongoing protocols
and who were followed expectantly.

Toxicity/Dose Modification
Toxicity was graded in accordance with the Common
Terminology Criteria, version 2.0. Dose modifications
and delays in treatment were specified for potential toxicities. Dose modifications for AG in both protocols were
reported previously.25,26
Dose modifications for paclitaxel were similar in
both protocols. If the granulocyte count was <1500 cells/
mm3 or if the platelet count was <100,000 cells/mm3,
then chemotherapy was held until counts recovered. The
paclitaxel dose was reduced by 20% for grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity or febrile neutropenia. Dose adjustments for platinum analogue-specific toxicities were
protocol specific. In Protocol A, cisplatin was held for
grade 3/4 renal toxicity, and subsequent doses of cisplatin
were divided over 3 days with predose mannitol 12.5 g. If
RF failed to recover, then no further cisplatin was given.
In Protocol B, carboplatin was reduced by 20% for grade
3 mucositis, febrile neutropenia, or grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Patients with grade 3 neurotoxicity were
removed from protocol.

Patient Evaluation
Baseline evaluation of patients included a history and
physical examination; complete blood count, clinical
chemistry, urinalysis, electrocardiogram, chest x-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis,
and radionuclide left ventriculogram or echocardiogram
and bone scans when indicated.
Clinical follow-up was performed 1 month after the
completion of adjuvant therapy, every 3 months for
2 years, every 6 months for 3 additional years, and yearly
thereafter. CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis were
obtained every 6 months for 2 years after therapy, then
yearly for 3 years. Patients in the control group were followed with CT scans every 3 months for the first 18
months, every 6 months for the next 18 months, and
yearly thereafter.
Biostatistics
The primary objective of this study was to compare the
OS and DSS of protocol patients with those observed in
patients who underwent surgery alone during the time of
protocol accrual (1997-2004). The patient population
was stratified and analyzed according to good RF versus
impaired RF. OS and DSS were calculated using the
Kaplan-Meier method and were compared using the logrank test. OS was defined as the time from surgery to the
date of death from any cause; and DSS was defined as the
time from surgery to the date of death caused by UC, censoring patients who remained alive or patients who died
of other/unknown causes. A sensitivity analysis was performed using a competing risk method27 by considering
all causes of death, excluding UC as a competing risk, and
censoring patients who remained alive at last follow-up.
All analyses were done within SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and R (version 2.5.1; R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

RESULTS
Between August 1997 and July 2004, 20 patients were
accrued on Protocol A (9 bladder primaries, 11 upper
tract), and 30 patients were accrued on Protocol B (28
bladder primaries, 2 upper tract). The median age of protocol patients was 62 years (range, 31-99 years). Twentyfive patients remained alive after a median follow-up of
Cancer

6.5 years (95%CI: 5.8-7.1 years). The median interval
from the date of surgery to the start of treatment was 2.1
months (95% CI, 0.9-4.6 months). The median OS was
4.5 years (95% CI, 2.6 to not achieved [NA]). There was
no difference in OS when the patients who had good RF
were compared with the patients who had impaired RF (P
¼ .8).
The MSKCC institutional database identified 1036
patients who underwent cystectomy or nephroureterectomy at our center between May 1997 and July 2004.
Two hundred three patients (116 with good RF and 87
with impaired RF) met the pathologic stage inclusion criteria for Protocols A and B but did not receive perioperative chemotherapy. The median age of this control group
was 70 years (range, 34-91 years), which was statistically
higher than the median age of the protocol patients (P <
.0001). Age, however, was not a predictor of OS when it
was analyzed as a continuous variable (P ¼ .6) or as a dichotomous variable (age 65 years vs <65 years; P ¼ .6).
There was no significant difference in stage (P ¼ .4) or
lymph node involvement (P ¼ .3) between the control
patients and the protocol patients.
Sixty-eight of these patients remained alive at a median follow-up of 4.7 years (95% CI, 4.1  5.5 years)
(Table 1). There was no statistically significant difference
(P ¼ .5) in median OS between control patients who had
normal RF (2.5 years; 95%CI, 1.6-3.1 years) and control
patients who had impaired RF (2 years; 95%CI, 1.4-2.9
years).
An analysis was performed comparing outcomes
among protocol patients and controls stratified by RF.
OS for protocol patients was greater than OS for
controls (good RF: 4.6 years [95% CI. 2.3 years to NA]
vs 2.5 years [95% CI, 1.7-3.3 years]; P ¼ .03; poor RF:
3.4 years [95% CI, 2.6 years to NA] vs 2 years [95%
CI, 1.5-3.2 years]; P ¼ .04). DSS among protocol
patients and control patients was similar (impaired RF:
3.4 years vs 3.3 years; P ¼ .4; Good RF: 4.6 years vs 3
years; P ¼ .24; Fig. 1). This observation of improved
OS without improved DSS may have been affected by
missing data. Disease-specific events were available for
100% of protocol patients but for only 73% of pathology-matched controls. Twenty-five patients on protocol
died from UC (15 patients with good RF and 10
patients with impaired RF), and there were 99 deaths
from UC in the control group.

Safety and Tolerability
Forty patients (80%) required treatment delay or cancellation. Reasons for those modifications included neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, infection, diarrhea,
abdominal cramping, renal insufficiency, palpitations,
carboplatin allergy, mucositis, and scheduling issues.
There were 24 treatment-related hospital admissions for
19 patients: The reasons for those admissions were neutropenic fever (5 episodes), non-neutropenic infection (11
episodes), dehydration (3 episodes), rectal bleeding (1 episode), renal impairment (2 episodes), treatment (1 episode), and stomatitis (1 episode). Treatment was stopped
prematurely for 1 patient because of a protocol error.
Neutropenia was the most common toxicity (14 episodes of grade 3 neutropenia and 3 episodes grade 4 neutropenia). Seven patients experienced grade 3 anemia, and
2 patients developed grade 3 thrombocytopenia. Nonhematologic grade 3 and 4 toxicities were uncommon and
included grade 3 thromboses (4 patients; 2 on each protocol). Severe nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and mucositis all
were observed, although infrequently. No patient developed grade 3/4 cardiac toxicity during treatment; after a
median 4.6 year follow-up, there was no reported delayed
cardiac toxicity. There was no treatment-induced grade 3/
4 neuropathy, although 7 patients developed grade 2 neuropathy, and 39 patients developed grade 1 neuropathy.

DISCUSSION
This study failed to demonstrate an improvement in DSS
for adjuvant treatment with dose-dense, sequential chemotherapy compared with contemporary patients who had
similar pathology and underwent cystectomy and lymphadenectomy alone. OS was improved across both treatment groups. Although this lack of DSS benefit may have
been a consequence of deficient data for the surgery-only
group, we cannot recommend further pursuit of this
approach in the adjuvant setting. For patients with breast
cancer, the North American Intergroup confirmed that
adjuvant dose-dense chemotherapy was superior to conventional treatment, with observed reductions in the annual odds of disease recurrence by 26% and in the annual
odds of death by 31%.28 Dose intensification with highdose methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin
(MVAC) has been investigated in metastatic UC and,
compared with standard MVAC, high-dose treatment
5198

resulted in an improvement in OS at a median follow-up
of 7.3 years (HR for death, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.58-0.99;
5-year survival rate, 22% vs 14%; P ¼ .042).29 It is possible that this difference in improved survival may be
related to more rapid dosing of all 4 drugs, including
cisplatin.
Aggressive, sequential chemotherapy in this patient
population is associated with substantial toxicity, poor
tolerance, and delays in initiation because of postoperative
surgical complications. A treatment modification was
required in 80% of protocol patients, and a delay in starting chemotherapy up to 4.6 months after surgery was
observed. A recent review of 1142 patients who underwent radical cystectomy at MSKCC demonstrated that
approximately 30% (347 patients) experienced a complication within 90 days after discharge that was severe
enough to interfere with the administration of adjuvant
therapy.30 The sequential approach in the current study
attempted to deliver optimal doses over a shorter time,
resulting in greater ‘‘dose density.’’ This rationale is
undermined if surgical complications prevent treatment
administration in a timely manner. With regard to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the US Intergroup study demonstrated that preoperative treatment with an aggressive 4drug regimen did not impact negatively on planned
surgery.31
There is a need for effective, noncisplatin-based
treatment for UC; and, to our knowledge, this study is the
first trial to compare a carboplatin-based regimen for the
adjuvant treatment of UC with surgery alone. Trials of
carboplatin-based regimens in patients with advanced UC
and normal RF have produced encouraging overall
response rates (30%-40%); however, complete response
rates and median survival rates are lower than those produced with cisplatin-based regimens.22-24 In the current
trial, the carboplatin-based regimen demonstrated a significant improvement in OS over surgery alone. However,
it is possible that patients who chose this adjuvant treatment had better outcomes because of unknown contributing factors, such as less medical comorbidities, thus
extending OS but not DSS. We believe that a perioperative chemotherapy benefit should be defined by improvements in both DSS and OS and that a standard analysis
for such studies should include a competing risk analysis
that considers death from another cause as a competing
risk.

Adjuvant Sequential Tx for Bladder CA/Gallagher et al

The current results underscore the idea that a ‘‘plateau of efficacy’’ has been reached in chemotherapy used
in the treatment of UC. We combined agents based on
their nonoverlapping toxicities, different mechanisms of
action, and synergism when administered at maximum
doses but failed to demonstrate a definitive survival
benefit. Triplet chemotherapy regimens in metastatic UC
have been similarly disappointing. A European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer multicenter,
phase 3 trial of over 600 patients demonstrated no
significant difference in either PFS or OS for paclitaxel,
cisplatin, and gemcitabine compared with cisplatin and
gemcitabine alone. Recent reports of activity for new
classes of drugs in metastatic UC offer hope of an
alternative therapeutic approach.32,33 Combinations of
traditional chemotherapy drugs with these newer agents
may improve outcomes in UC, which has been the
case with bevacizumab in colon, lung, and breast
cancer.34-36
Our results are limited for several reasons. We chose
a cohort of stage-matched, contemporary controls, but a
nonrandomized, retrospective comparison inherently is
flawed and compares unfavorably with a prospective
study. In addition, patients were followed more frequently
if they were on protocol, which may have enabled earlier
detection of recurrence. The effect of surgical quality on
survival in UC has been well documented.37-39 We
attempted to control for this by using a control group
who underwent surgery performed by the same urologists
during the same period. Our analysis did not stratify for
the number of lymph nodes resected, because those data
were not available in all patients; and, because of the small
protocol group of 50 patients stratified into 2 groups
based on RF, further subset analysis would be error-prone.
The only significant difference between the 2 groups was
the younger median age of the protocol group (age 62
years vs age 70 years; P < .0001). Although age was not a
significant predictor of survival, it is possible that control
patients who died of other causes contributed to a lower
survival rate in the control group, resulting in an OS benefit for protocol patients without an improvement in DSS.
Disease-specific events were available in 100% of protocol
patients compared with only 73% of controls, and cause
of death was not known for 27 patients (13%) in the control group. Results could have been affected if these
patients died of bladder cancer. Nonetheless, the differCancer

November 15, 2009

ence that we report between OS and DSS emphasizes the
importance of reporting DSS for all such studies.
In summary, we report that adjuvant treatment with
a 4-drug, sequential chemotherapy regimen failed to
improve DSS in patients who had high-risk, extravesical
UC compared with the DSS observed for contemporary
controls who underwent surgery alone. Therapy was
poorly tolerated, illustrating the difficulty in delivering intensive chemotherapy in a timely manner to an older
patient population in the postoperative setting. The optimal trial design for studying sequential therapy would be
a random assignment study, and such a trial was initiated
within the US intergroup mechanism. However that trial
was closed early because of poor accrual. These study
results, plus the closure of the intergroup trial, effectively
terminate the investigation of intensive-dose, sequential
chemotherapy in UC. Phase 3 trials in Europe continue to
study whether adjuvant, conventional-dose chemotherapy
confers a survival benefit. Conversely, our institutional
investigational approach to perioperative therapy trials
has switched to the neoadjuvant setting in which benefit is
supported by level 1 evidence.40 Newer drugs incorporated in these trials may achieve benefit that is not
observed with combinations of multiple older chemotherapy agents.
