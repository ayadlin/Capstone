ABSTRACT
Purpose: This prospective phase II, open label, study was designed to assess
the efficacy and safety of D-CAG induction treatment for elderly patients with newly
diagnosed AML.
Experimental Design: All patients in this study were treated with decitabine of 15
mg/m2 for 5 days and G-CSF for priming, in combination with cytarabine of 10-mg/
m2 q12h for 7 days and aclarubicin of 10 mg/day for 4 days (D-CAG).
Results: Among 85 evaluable patients, overall response rate (ORR) and complete
remission (CR) were 82.4% and 64.7%, respectively, after 1 cycle of therapy. The ORR
in patients aged <70 years was 83.0% and 81.6% in patients aged ≥70 years. There
was a significantly longer median overall survival (OS) in patients with response
(16 months) than in those without response (7 months, p< 0.0001). The OS for
patients aged ≥70 years and 60-69 years was 10 months and 12 months, respectively
(p=0.4994). The two-year OS probability was 19.2% and the twenty-month survival
rate was 33.8%. Induction mortality of D-CAG treated elderly patients with AML is
4.4%.
Conclusion: D-CAG regimen was well tolerated and showed a promising clinic
efficacy in elderly patients with AML (≥70 years).

INTRODUCTION

those cases, 42 patients (46.2%) were ≥ 70 years of age.
Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. According
to WHO classification, 91 patients had AML (53 de novo,
38 secondary AML). Karyotype included 55 patients
(60.4%) with diploid cytogenetics, 15 (16.5%) with
chromosome -5/-7 or complex cytogenetic abnormalities,
and 12 (13.2%) with other miscellaneous chromosomal
abnormalities. Overall, 70 patients (76.9%) were
considered ineligible for intensive chemotherapy (aged
˃70 years, ECOG PS ≥3, comorbidity score ≥2, or adverse
cytogenetic).

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the elderly
population (aged ≥70 years) has a high incidence with >20
cases per 100000 patients every year[1]. The combination
of cytarabine and anthracycline remains the cornerstone of
chemotherapy in those patients and this treatment confers
remission in up to 60% of elderly patients with de novo
disease and 40% with secondary AML[2]. However,
many elderly patients develop disease recurrence and die
of either disease progression or associated complications.
Therefore, those strategies including intensive
chemotherapy, low-dose cytarabine, and palliative care
are not the appealing approaches for most elderly patients
with AML[3].
The combination of novel drugs and low-intensity
chemotherapy were developed to reduce the early
mortality and improve the benefit-risk ratio for longterm survival in elderly AML patients. Among them,
DNA hypomethylating agents showed better single-agent
clinical activities in both myelodysplastic syndromes
(MDS) and AML, with high survival rates and low risks
associated with induction chemotherapy [4-6]. Decitabine,
a hypomethylating agent, inhibits DNA methyltransferase
1(DNMT1)[7], reactivates of silenced genes, and induces
differentiation of leukemia cells[8]. In clinic, decitabine
treatment decreased methylation and induced a better
clinical response [9]. Several clinical trials indicated that
low-dose of decitabine (15-20 mg/m2/day, the optimal
demethylation dose in vitro) led to a significantly better
response rate [4-6, 10-12]. Although the mechanistic basis
for the clinical activity of decitabine has not been precisely
defined, the clinical and biologic activities of decitabine
are very encouraging [10, 12, 13].
Our previous studies revealed that the standarddose of CAG regimen consisting of low-dose cytarabine
and aclarubicin in combination with granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF) priming as an induction
therapy was well-tolerated by patients and led to a
complete remission (CR) rate of 50.0% in patients aged
≥ 70 years, and a CR rate of 40.0% in patients with
unfavorable cytogenetic aberrations[14]. In this study, we
conducted a phase II trial that evaluated the efficacy and
safety of decitabine in combination with modified CAG
regimen (low-dose cytarabine and aclarubicin) in elderly
patients with AML.

Treatment outcomes

Response rates for all patients or selected
subgroups
Patient responses were summarized in Fig. 2.
There were 85 patients evaluable for response assessment
following the D-CAG induction therapy and had an overall
response rate (ORR) of 82.4% after the first cycle. Among
them, 55 (64.7%) achieved CR and 15 (17.7%) had PR.
After the second cycle, 11 patients with PR acquired CR.
The ORR in patients with aged ˂70 years was 83.0% and
81.6% in patients with aged ≥70 years. The CR in patients
with presenting WBC˃30 × 109/L (range, 30.9-239 ×
109/L) was 68.4% (13 of 19). The CR was observed in all
cytogenetic subsets. For patients with a normal karyotype,
84.3% (43 of 51) achieved CR. 18 of 63 patients with
CR (28.6%) had abnormal karyotypes at baseline with
complete cytogenetic responses (CCyR, 0% abnormal
metaphase) of 77.8% (14 of 18). Patients with complex
karyotypes (defined as ≥3 abnormalities) had an ORR of
92.9% (CR, 78.6%) and 7 of 8 patients with chromosome
-5/-7 (87.5%) achieved CR.

Overall survival of elderly patients with AML
Upon final analysis (April 30, 2014), the median OS
for all patients was 10 months (range, 1-42 months) with
a 1- and 2-year OS probability of 46.23% and 19.16%,
respectively (Fig. 3A). Median OS was 10 months
(range, 1-42 months) for patients aged ≥70 years and
12 months (range, 1-39 months) for patients aged 60-69
years (p=0.4994, 95% CI=0.7194 to 1.966) (Fig. 3B).
There was a significantly longer median OS in responders
than in non-responders (16 vs 7 months, p˂0.0001, 95%
CI= 0.0397 to 0.3198) (Fig. 3C). However, survival was
shorter for patients with poor karyotype (-5/-7 or complex
karyotype) in comparison with patients with normal
karyotype (p= 0.0269, 95% CI= 0.1788 to 0.9007, Fig.
3D).

Figure 1: Enrollment and outcomes. 91 AML patients were treated with decitabine for 5 consecutive days (day 1-5) and G-CSF (day

0-9) for priming combined with cytarabine (day 3-9), aclarubicin for 4 days (day 3-6) (D-CAG). Up to two cycles of induction therapy
were allowed if response was not achieved. Patients who achieved CR accepted the next cycle treatment for recovery of hematopoiesis
and resolution of all toxicities. Patients who did not achieve CR or PR after the second cycle of induction therapy were offered alternative

in exons 14 and 15 of the FLT3 gene and show a broad
variation in the position of their insertion sites, as well as
in number and sizes of the duplicated fragments[16]. The
most common NPM1 mutations include type A mutations
(TCTG) in 80%, followed by type B (CATG) and type
D (CCTG) mutations in about 10%, and a spectrum of
other mutations accounting for 10% of cases[17]. Two
types of CEBPα mutations are predominant. N-terminal
frame-shift mutations lead to loss of translation of the
full-length 42 kD CEBPα and the overexpression of a
truncated, dominant negative 30 kD CEBPα. C-terminal
in-frame insertions/deletions prevent homo-dimerization
or hetero-dimerization of CEBPα[18]. In our study, we
found that patients without FLT3-ITD mutation have a
survival advantage in compared with those with FLT3ITD mutation (p=0.013, 95% CI=0.0296 to 0.660) (Fig.
4A). A median OS for patients with wild-type NPM1 or
with mutations in NPM1 only or with mutations in NPM1
and FLT3-ITD was 17, 15 and 5 months, respectively
(p=0.0778) (Fig. 4B). A significant OS difference was also
observed in patients with CEBPα mutations vs. without
CEBPα mutations (p=0.012, 95% CI=1.287 to 7.551) (Fig.

Treatment-related toxicity

Serious Adverse Events
Overall, D-CAG was well tolerated. Table. 3
showed the most frequent adverse events observed during
induction therapy. The most common grade 3 and 4
toxicities included thrombocytopenia and neutropenia,
while the incidence of non-hematological toxicities was
low. Myelosuppression was commonly observed, and
febrile neutropenia occurred in 92.3% of patients.
In patients with CR, the median time was 16 days
(range, 5-50 days) for platelet recovery and 23 days
(range, 16-46 days) for granulocyte recovery. After a
single induction, the platelet count in patients recovered
briskly to the normal range, platelets rose and peaked
above 500×109/L in 20 patients (all responders), and the
count returned to the normal range within 7-10 days.
During convalescence, no thrombotic complications were
observed.

DISCUSSION
This phase II study represents, to the best of our
knowledge, the first reported prospective trial investigating
the use of decitabine in combination with G-CSF, lowdose aclarubicin and cytarabine as the first-line therapy for
elderly patients with AML. It was carried out to evaluate
the efficacy of D-CAG combination therapy and assess the
adverse events in those elderly patients with AML.
Several rationales guide us to design the D-CAG
regimen to treat elderly AML patient. DNA methylation
was dose dependent with a plateau and correlated with
response to decitabine at low (5-20 mg/m2/d) but not high
doses [19]. DNMT1 depletion by decitabine is S-phase
dependent, and is more extensive in actively cycling cells
[20]. G-CSF priming induced G0/G1 phase leukemia
cells into S phase and caused leukemia cells response
to decitabine. In addition, the combination of decitabine
and cytarabine showed an additive or synergistic effect
on cell death in human leukemia cell lines in vitro[7].
Those previous studies suggest that D-CAG regimen
may achieve better outcomes in elderly AML patients.
Our study showed that decitabine in combination with
CAG was well tolerated and effective with CR of 77.7%
in elderly patients with previously untreated AML. Our
study also revealed a CR of 76.3% and median survival
of 10 months, while only 2 patients (4.76%) died within 8
weeks in 42 patients ≥70 years of age. The patients aged
≥70 years benefit more from decitabine in combination
with low-dose CAG in comparison with patients from our
previous study. With CAG treatment, the ORR and CR
were 72.0% and 58.0%, respectively [14]. The median OS
was 14 months. In comparison, with D-CAG treatment,
ORR and CR were 82.4% and 64.7%, respectively, after
1 cycle of therapy. The ORR in patients aged ˂70 years
was 83.0% and 81.6% in patients aged ≥70 years. There
was a significantly longer median OS in patients with
response (16 months). Compared to cytarabine-based
intensive chemotherapy, our D-CAG-based intensive
chemotherapy also showed a higher CR and a longer
median survival. A recent study of the cytarabine-based
intensive chemotherapy on 446 patients ≥70 years of age
with AML obtained a CR of 45%, and a median survival
of 4.6 months in all patients, 13.8 months in CR patients,
and 8-weeks mortality was 36% [3].
Our study also showed that CR might be an
important index to predict the survival probability of
elderly patients with AML. In this phase II trial, the
survival probability of patients with CR was significantly

higher than that of patients without response to D-CAG
treatment. These results were comparable to other studies,
suggesting that CR might be required for prolonged
survival [21].
An interesting finding from this study was that the
CR rate in patients with poor karyotype was similar to that
in other patients. Consistent with results from an earlier
study, there was a clear benefit for patients with both
CR and CCyR after induction of chemotherapy [22,23].
Similarly, another study showed that 19/61 (31.2%) MDS
patients with clonal chromosomal abnormalities achieved
major cytogenetic responses after a median of > 2 cycles
(3 cycles) of treatment with low-dose decitabine and had
a prolonged OS. Those studies suggested that decitabine
induction might be important for patients with poor
karyotype. We also found that our patients with “highrisk” chromosomal abnormalities, such as chromosome
7 abnormalities and complex abnormalities, tend to have
a longer OS (8.5 months) than that previously reported
[14,24]. Decitabine may inhibit those chromosomal
abnormalities induced DNA hypermethylation and
inactivated genes and cause the longer OS of AML
patients.
The prognostic impact of NPM1, CEBPα and
FLT3-ITD mutations, was first established by cytogenentic
analysis in AML patients who were ˂60 years of age
[30]. Similarly, the relative favorable effect of NPM1
mutation and CEBPα mutation and the unfavorable
effect of FLT3-ITD mutation were also manifested in
elderly AML patients [25-27]. However, there has not
been any favorable effect in elderly patients with the
NPM1 mutation, in whom the 2-year OS rate was 19% in
a combined SWOG/MRC data analysis [28]. Our study
showed that the relative favorable OS was achieved
in patients with CEBPα mutations, while the outcome
in patients with FLT3-ITD was significantly poorer.
Interesting, NPM1 mutation itself did not lead to a better
survival. These results should be explained with caution,
as the patient’s sample pool in each group was relative
small. Therefore, the role of NPM1 mutation or other gene
mutations, such as IDH1, IDH2 and TET2 et.al, in the
response of elderly AML patients to D-CAG needs further
in-depth investigation.
Our results also suggested that clinical benefit from
decitabine in combination with low-dose CAG treatment
might be linked to the ability to suppress the abnormal
clone. However, we found that decitabine alone or in
combination with other agents failed to eradicate the
abnormal clone. In our study, 11 out of 18 patients with
CCyR had a cytogenetic relapse (6 BM relapse and 1
extramedullary relapse). These results were consistent
with earlier findings, which suggested that the initial
cytogenetic clone can relapse upon D-CAG treatment and
D-CAG regimen may not eradicate the abnormal clone
[29,30].
In conclusion, decitabine in combination with lowwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

dose CAG treatment appeared to be a feasible, safe and
effective for elderly patients with AML. Early results
of this prospective trial demonstrated the effectiveness
of decitabine-CAG combination and, thus far, limited
treatment-related adverse effects in elderly patients.
Additional follow-up and more robust phase 2 studies are
needed to assess the efficacy and safety of D-CAG-based
chemotherapy in elderly patients with AML.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
For this multi-center, phase II study, we recruited
elderly patients with AML from 11 medical centers in
China from October 2010 through March 2013. This
study was registered at www.chictr.org as ChiCTRONC-11001700. Patients aged ≥60 years with newly
diagnosed de novo or secondary AML according to the
International Working Group (IWG) criteria [31] who
refused or were not candidates for intensive chemotherapy
were eligible. All patients had an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0-3
with the creatinine level and total bilirubin of ≤2 mg/dL.
Exclusion criteria included acute promyelocytic leukemia,
another malignancy without remission. Patients must not
have previous chemotherapy (other than hydroxyurea) for
any myeloid disorder. Comorbidities were assessed using
hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index
(HCT-CI)[32]. This study was performed in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki and all patients provided
written informed consent. All study procedures and
informed consent forms were approved by Institutional
Review Board.

Study design
All patients were treated with decitabine of 15 mg/
m2 intravenously over 4h for 5 consecutive days (day 1-5)
and G-CSF of 300 μg/day (day 0-9) for priming combined
with cytarabine of 10 mg/m2 q12h for 7 days (day 3-9),
aclarubicin of 10 mg/day for 4 days (day 3-6) (D-CAG).
The G-CSF priming was discontinued if white blood count
(WBC) was >20×109/L. Hydroxyurea was permitted as
rescue medication to control WBC to <5.0×109/L and but
was discontinued at least 24h before decitabine treatment.
Up to two cycles of induction therapy were allowed
if response was not achieved. Patients who achieved
CR accepted the next cycle treatment for recovery of
hematopoiesis and resolution of all toxicities. Patients
who did not achieve CR or partial remission (PR) after the
second cycle of induction therapy were offered alternative
therapies. Post-remission therapy consisted of 4-6 cycles
at the discretion of attending physician, including alternate

D-CAG and conventional chemotherapy [cytarabine (100
mg/m2 for 7 days) in combination with homoharringtonine
(2 mg/m2/day for 7 days) or an anthracyclin agent, such
as daunorubicin (30 mg/m2 for 3 days)]. In patients aged
≥70 years and/ or with ECOG≥2, or with hypoplasia/
cytopenia, doses were reduced to 70% of scheduled dose
levels in subsequent cycles. Treatment was continued until
relapse or progressive disease, death, or unacceptable
toxicity occurred, or patients/physicians requested the
discontinuity. All patients received antimicrobials,
supportive care, and transfusions of blood products
according to the institutional guidelines.
Treatment responses were defined according to
the modified 2003 IWG criteria [31]. Morphologic CR
included normalization of bone marrow blasts (≤5%
blasts) and peripheral blood counts (absolute neutrophil
count ≥1.0×109/L and platelet >100 ×109/L). PR was
defined as morphologic CR and 5-15% blasts with a
decrease of at least 50% of total bone marrow blasts.
Time to hematopoietic recovery was measured from the
last day of chemotherapy to the time when the neutrophil
count was >0.5×109/L and platelet count was more than
20×109/L. All other patients were considered as nonresponders.
Conventional cytogenetic evaluation was also
performed after induction therapy. The overall survival
(OS) was measured from the time at beginning of the
study to death (any cause). Disease-free survival (DFS)
was calculated from the date of remission to an event,
including resistance, PR, relapse, or death. Early induction
mortality within 4 weeks was calculated.
Toxicities were assessed according to Common
Terminology Criteria For Adverse Events (CTCAE)
version 3.0. Safety was assessed using adverse events,
physical examinations, vital signs, and central laboratory
assessments.

Statistical analysis
Survival curves were plotted by the Kaplan-Meier
method and compared by using the log-rank (MantekCox) test stratified by baseline age, cytogenetic risk, and
response after treatment. In order to analyze the related
impact of each variant on survival, hazard ratios (HRs)
and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated by using
a Cox proportional hazards model stratified by gender,
disease, age, cytogenetic risk, WBC at diagnosis, BM
blasts, ECOG PS and HCT-CI, respectively. Differences in
subgroups by different covariates were evaluated by using
the chi-square test for nominal values. A p value <0.05
was considered significant.

Cytogenetic and mutation analysis
Bone marrow (BM) cells were harvested directly
or after 1-3 days of unstimulated culture, as described
previously. Metaphase cells were banded via an improved
heat treatment and R-banding method. Genomic DNA
was isolated from BM specimens. Mutation analysis
of three relevant molecular marker genes (NPM1,
CEBPα and FLT3-ITD) was carried out as described
previously[15]. The mutation was determined by
collection of the mutated polymerase chain reaction
fragment followed by sequencing. The primers used
to detect the gene mutation are listed. NPM1 mutation
forward primer: TTAACTCTCTGGTGGTAGAATGAA,
NPM1
