Abstract

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Cancer immunoediting, the process whereby the immune system controls tumour outgrowth and
shapes tumour immunogenicity, is comprised of three phases: elimination, equilibrium and
escape1–5. Although many immune components that participate in this process are known, its
underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. A central tenet of cancer immunoediting is that T
cell recognition of tumour antigens drives the immunologic destruction or sculpting of a
developing cancer. However, our current understanding of tumour antigens comes largely from
analyses of cancers that develop in immunocompetent hosts and thus may have already been
edited. Little is known about the antigens expressed in nascent tumour cells, whether they are
sufficient to induce protective anti-tumour immune responses or whether their expression is
modulated by the immune system. Here, using massively parallel sequencing, we characterize
expressed mutations in highly immunogenic methylcholanthrene-induced sarcomas derived from
immunodeficient Rag2−/− mice which phenotypically resemble nascent primary tumour cells1,3,5.
Employing class I prediction algorithms, we identify mutant spectrin-β2 as a potential rejection
antigen of the d42m1 sarcoma and validate this prediction by conventional antigen expression
cloning and detection. We also demonstrate that cancer immunoediting of d42m1 occurs via a T
cell-dependent immunoselection process that promotes outgrowth of pre-existing tumour cell
clones lacking highly antigenic mutant spectrin-β2 and other potential strong antigens. These
results demonstrate that the strong immunogenicity of an unedited tumour can be ascribed to
expression of highly antigenic mutant proteins and show that outgrowth of tumour cells that lack
these strong antigens via a T cell-dependent immunoselection process represents one mechanism
of cancer immunoediting.

For this study, we chose two representative, highly immunogenic, unedited
methylcholanthrene (MCA)-induced sarcoma cell lines, d42m1 and H31m1, derived from
immunodeficient Rag2−/− mice1. Both grow progressively when transplanted orthotopically
into Rag2−/− mice, but are rejected when transplanted into naive wild type (WT) mice
(Supplementary Fig. 1 and 2). Using a modified form of exome sequencing involving cDNA
capture by mouse exome probes and Illumina deep sequencing (i.e., cDNA Capture
Sequencing (“cDNA CapSeq”)), we identified 3,737 somatic, non-synonymous mutations in
d42m1 cells (3,398 missense, 221 nonsense, 2 nonstop and 116 splice site mutations) and
2,677 non-synonymous mutations in H31m1 cells (2,391 missense, 160 nonsense, 3 nonstop
and 123 splice site mutations) (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 1).
The mutations in each cell line were largely distinct—d42m1 and H31m1 share only 119
identical missense mutations (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 2)—a result that potentially
explains the unique antigenicity of each cell line (Supplementary Fig. 4). Although d42m1
and H31m1 display mutations in known cancer genes6, the functional effects of these novel
mutations remain undefined. Nevertheless, both tumours have cancer-causing mutations in
Kras (codon 12) and Trp53 that are frequently observed in human and mouse cancers7,8,9
(Supplementary Table 3). The mutation calls were confirmed by independent Roche/454

pyrosequencing of 22 genes using tumour genomic DNA and by documenting their absence
in normal cells from the same mouse that developed the tumour (Supplementary Table 4).

Author Manuscript

Comparing cDNA CapSeq data of d42m1 and H31m1 cells to human cancer genomes10–17
revealed two similarities. First, 46–47% of mutations in d42m1 and H31m1 are C/A or G/T
transversions which represent chemical-carcinogen signatures7,13,14 similar to those of lung
cancers from smokers (44–46%) but not seen in human cancers induced by other
mechanisms (8–16%) (Fig. 1c). Second, the mutation rates of d42m1 and H31m1 are about
10-fold higher than those of lung cancers from smokers, but within 3-fold of hypermutator
smoker lung cancers with mutations in DNA repair pathway genes (Fig. 1d). Interestingly,
d42m1 and H31m1 also display mutations in DNA repair genes (Supplementary Table 3),
although these novel mutations have not been functionally characterized. Thus, mouse
MCA-induced sarcomas display qualitative and quantitative genomic similarities to
carcinogen-induced human cancers.

When parental d42m1 sarcoma cells were transplanted into naïve WT mice, approximately
20% of recipients developed escape tumours (Supplementary Fig. 5a, c). Cell lines made
from three escape tumours (d42m1-es1, d42m1-es2 and d42m1-es3) formed progressively
growing sarcomas when transplanted into naïve WT recipients (Fig. 2a). In contrast, parental
d42m1 tumour cells passaged through Rag2−/− mice maintained high immunogenicity
(Supplementary Fig. 5b, d). Additional analyses revealed that whereas 8 of 10 clones of
d42m1 were rejected in WT mice, two clones (d42m1-T3 and d42m1-T10) grew with
kinetics similar to d42m1 escape tumours (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 6). Thus, the
d42m1 cell line consists mostly, but not entirely, of highly immunogenic clones and
undergoes immunoediting in WT mice. cDNA CapSeq of parental d42m1 cells, clones and
escape tumours revealed that all expressed similar numbers of mutations (Supplementary
Fig. 7a and Supplementary Table 1) and phylogenetic analysis revealed that all d42m1derived cells were genomically related to one another but distinct from H31m1 and normal
fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig. 7b). However, regressor clones clustered more closely to
parental d42m1 cells while progressor clones clustered more closely to cells from escape
tumours. Thus, the d42m1 tumour cell line consists of a related, but heterogeneous
population of tumour cells.

Author Manuscript

Tumour-specific mutant proteins presented on mouse or human MHC class I molecules are
known to represent one class of tumour-specific antigens for CD8+ T cells18,19. Therefore,
we used in silico analysis20 to assess the theoretical capacities of missense mutations from
d42m1-related tumour cells to bind MHC class I proteins. Each d42m1-related cell type
expressed many potential high affinity (IC50 < 50 nM; Affinity Value > 2) epitopes that
could bind to H-2Db or H-2Kb (Fig. 2b). Of these, 39–42 were expressed only in the
regressor subset of d42m1-related cells (7–9 for H-2Db, 30–35 for H-2Kb), including 31
expressed in all regressor cells (Supplementary Table 5). Thus, ~1% of the missense
mutations in d42m1 are selectively expressed in rejectable d42m1 clones.
Whereas parental and regressor d42m1 cells stimulated IFN-γ release in vitro when
incubated with a specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clone (C3) derived from a
WT mouse that had rejected parental d42m1 tumour cells (Fig. 3a, b), progressor d42m1

clones, cells from escape tumours or unrelated MCA sarcomas were not. This result
demonstrated that all regressor d42m1 tumour cells share a mutation that forms the epitope
recognized by C3 CTLs. Since recognition of d42m1 regressor cells by C3 CTLs is
restricted by H-2Db (Fig. 3c), we postulated that an R913L mutation in spectrin-β2 produced
the most likely target for C3 CTLs because its expression was restricted to d42m1 regressor
clones and it formed an epitope that showed high affinity binding potential to H-2Db in
contrast to the WT sequence predicted to bind with low affinity (Fig. 3d and Supplementary
Table 5).

Author Manuscript

To verify the importance of mutant spectrin-β2 on d42m1 antigenicity, we independently
identified the tumour antigen recognized by the C3 CTL clone using a T cell-based
expression cloning approach21. After three screening rounds, a single positive cDNA was
identified encoding a sequence identical to the R913L spectrin-β2 mutant (Fig. 3e). Thus,
conventional antigen expression cloning identified the same mutation predicted by the
genomic sequencing.

Author Manuscript

Mutation-specific qRT-PCR revealed the presence of mutant spectrin-β2 mRNA in parental
d42m1 tumour cells and regressor d42m1 clones, but not in progressor d42m1 clones or
escape tumours (Fig. 3f), nor in normal tissue of the mouse from which the d42m1 tumour
was derived (Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Fig. 8). Additionally, C3 CTLs
discriminated between mutant and WT spectrin-β2 peptide sequences when presented on an
unrelated H-2Db expressing cell line (Fig. 3g). Whereas the mutant (VAVVNQIAL) peptide
stimulated C3 CTLs in a dose-dependent manner, the WT (VAVVNQIAR) peptide did not,
even when added in 1000-fold excess. Using labeled H-2Db tetramers generated with mutant
peptide, mutant spectrin-β2 specific CD8+ T cells accumulated over time in parental d42m1
tumours developing in vivo and draining lymph nodes (DLNs) prior to tumour rejection
(Fig. 4a, b). In contrast, no mutant spectrin-β2 specific CD8+ T cells were detected in
progressively growing escape tumours or DLNs. These data demonstrate that mutant
spectrin-β2 expressed selectively in a high proportion of unedited d42m1 tumour cells
evokes a T cell response in naïve WT mice that promotes the elimination of antigen
expressing tumour cells.

Author Manuscript

To test whether expression of mutant spectrin-β2 was sufficient to drive rejection of d42m1
tumour cells, we enforced expression of either mutant or WT spectrin-β2 in d42m1-es3 cells
that lack this mutation (Supplementary Fig. 9a) and followed their growth in WT mice.
Whereas d42m1-es3 tumour cell clones transduced with either control retrovirus or
retrovirus encoding WT spectrin-β2 (WT.1 and WT.3) grew progressively with growth
kinetics similar to unmanipulated d42m1-es3 cells, d42m1-es3 clones expressing mutant
spectrin-β2 (mu.6 and mu.14) were rejected in WT mice, but not in Rag2−/− mice (Fig. 4c
and Supplementary Fig. 9b, c, d). CD8+ T cells specific for mutant spectrin-β2 did not
infiltrate d42m1-es3 tumours expressing WT spectrin-β2 (WT.3), but were present in
rejecting d42m1-es3 tumours expressing mutant spectrin-β2 (mu.14) (Fig. 4d). Thus, mutant
spectrin-β2 is indeed a major rejection antigen of d42m1 sarcoma cells and d42m1 escape
from immune control is the consequence of outgrowth of d42m1 clones that lack expression
of dominant rejection antigens.

The possibility that the lack of dominant rejection antigen(s) in a small subset of d42m1
cells was due to epigenetic silencing was ruled out because no spectrin-β2 mutation was (a)
found by sequencing genomic DNA from progressor d42m1 clones or escape tumours
(Supplementary Table 4) or (b) expressed in d42m1 progressor clones or escape tumours
following treatment with inhibitors of methyltransferases or histone deacetylases
(Supplementary Fig. 10). We therefore asked whether T cell-dependent immunoselection
explained outgrowth of escape tumours. Specifically, we examined the in vivo growth
behavior of a tumour cell mixture containing a vast majority of highly immunogenic, mutant
spectrin-β2+ d42m1-T2 cells and a minority of mutant spectrin-β2− d42m1-T3 progressor
cells. To distinguish between the two cell types, we labeled d42m1-T2 with RFP (modified
to eliminate class I epitopes) and d42m1-T3 with GFP and documented that the labeling did
not alter their in vivo growth characteristics. We found that we could recapitulate the tumour
growth phenotype of parental d42ml at a ratio of 95% d42m1-T2 cells to 5% d42m1-T3
cells (Fig. 4e). At this ratio, 100% of Rag2−/− mice and WT mice depleted of either CD4+ or
CD8+ T cells developed progressively growing tumours (Fig. 4f). In contrast, 5/20 (25%)
WT mice injected with the tumour cell mixture developed escape tumours, a result that
recapitulated the behavior of parental d42m1. Tumours harvested from Rag2−/− mice were
comprised of 84% d42m1-T2 cells and 14% d42m1-T3 cells (Fig. 4h) and expressed mutant
spectrin-β2 (Fig. 4g), i.e., they resembled the initial 95:5 cell mixture. In contrast, tumours
that grew out in WT mice consisted of 98% d42m1-T3 tumour cells and lacked mutant
spectrin-β2 (Fig. 4g, h). Thus, d42m1 escape tumours develop as a consequence of T celldependent immunoselection favoring the outgrowth of tumour cells that lack major rejection
antigens.

This report shows that the combination of cancer exome sequencing and in silico epitope
prediction algorithms can identify highly immunogenic, tumour-specific mutational antigens
in unedited carcinogen-induced cancers that serve as targets for the elimination phase of
cancer immunoediting. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use a genomics approach
to experimentally identify a tumour antigen, to specifically identify an antigen from an
unedited tumour and to demonstrate that T cell-dependent immunoselection is a mechanism
underlying outgrowth of tumour cells that lack strong rejection antigens. This mechanism
most likely also produces other types of escape tumours, such as those that develop
inactivating mutations in antigen presentation genes (e.g., those encoding MHC class I
proteins), which are frequently observed in clinically apparent human cancers22,23.
Developing carcinogen-induced tumours (e.g., mouse MCA sarcomas or human smoker
lung cancers) may be the preferred targets of cancer immunoediting because they express
the greatest number of mutations that might function as neoantigens. However, since ~1% of
the mutations in d42m1 are selectively expressed in regressor tumour clones, it is possible
that spontaneous tumours arising by other means that harbour as few as 100–200 mutations
could still be susceptible to immunological sculpting as they develop.
The immunodominance of mutant spectrin-β2 in driving tumour rejection in many ways
resembles that of certain viral antigens24 and is likely due to the presence in d42m1 of 4
copies of chromosome 11 that carries the spectrin-β2 gene thereby producing a highly
abundant neoepitope that binds to H-2Db 750-fold stronger than that of the WT sequence.

More work is needed to determine which of the other mutations, if any, selectively
expressed in d42m1 regressors function as rejection antigens. Immunoepitope analysis of
parental H31m1 reveals that it expresses multiple potential strong neoantigens (19 potential
strong binders to H-2Db and 58 to H-2Kb) (Supplementary Fig. 11a) and induces both
H-2Db and H-2Kb restricted CD8+ T cell responses during rejection (Supplementary Fig.
11b). This result suggests that H31m1 displays an even more complex antigenicity than
d42m1 and probably explains why H31m1 never produces escape tumours in WT mice
(Supplementary Fig. 11c).

Author Manuscript

Chemically-induced tumours have played a critical role in the history of tumour
immunology, providing the first unequivocal demonstration of tumour-specific antigens25,26
and, subsequently the first evidence of cancer immunoediting1,2. It is therefore significant
that this same model has now provided new insights into the antigenic targets of cancer
immunoediting and some of the key molecular mechanisms that drive the process. While
more work is needed to determine whether and how frequently this process occurs during
development of spontaneous and carcinogen-induced human cancers, it is tempting to
speculate that a genomics approach to tumour antigen identification could, in the future,
facilitate the development of individualized cancer immunotherapies directed at tumourspecific—rather than cancer-associated—antigens.

procedures approved by the AAALAC accredited Animal Studies Committee of Washington
University in St. Louis.
Tumour transplantation

Author Manuscript

3-methylcholanthrene (MCA)-induced sarcomas used in this study were generated in male
129/Sv strain wild type or Rag2−/− mice and banked as low passage tumour cells as
previously described1. Tumour cells derived from frozen stocks were propagated in vitro in
RPMI media (Hyclone, Logan, UT) supplemented with 10% FCS (Hyclone) and injected
subcutaneously in 150 μl of endotoxin-free PBS into the flanks of recipient mice. Tumour
cells were >90% viable at the time of injection as assessed by trypan blue exclusion and
tumour size was quantified as the average of two perpendicular diameters. For antibody
depletion studies, 250 μg of control Ig (PIP), anti-CD4 (GK1.5), or anti-CD8α (YTS169.4)
were injected intraperitoneally into mice at day −1 and every 7 days thereafter.
Isolation of normal skin fibroblasts
Skin fibroblasts were isolated from three independent male 129/Sv Rag2−/− pups by
harvesting skin and incubating in 0.25% trypsin (Hyclone) at 37°C for 30 minutes prior to

washing in DMEM media (Hyclone). After washing, chunks of skin were filtered to achieve
single cell suspensions and cultured in vitro with DMEM media. After 3 passages, skin
fibroblasts were harvested to isolate genomic DNA and total RNA.
Extraction of genomic or complementary DNA
Genomic DNA from sarcoma cells and normal skin fibroblasts was extracted using DNeasy
Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). For cDNA isolation, total RNA from sarcoma cells and
normal skin fibroblasts was isolated using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and cDNA was
synthesized using oligo (dT) primers and SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen).

cDNA samples from each tumour (100 ng) were constructed into Illumina libraries
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA) with the following
modifications: 1) cDNA was fragmented using Covaris S2 DNA Sonicator (Covaris, Inc.
Woburn, MA) in 1X end-repair buffer followed by the direct addition of the enzyme repair
cocktail (Lucigen, Madison, WI). Fragment sizes ranged between 100 and 500 bp. 2)
Illumina adapter-ligated DNA was amplified in four 50 μl PCRs for five cycles using 4 μl
adapter-ligated cDNA, 2X Phusion Master Mix and 250 nM forward and reverse primers,
5′AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCC
GAT C and 5′
CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATGTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCG
AT C, respectively. 3) Solid Phase Reversible Immobilization (SPRI) bead cleanup was
used to purify the PCR-amplified library and to select for 300–500 bp fragments. 500 ng of
the size-fractionated Illumina library was hybridized with the Agilent mouse exome reagent.
After hybridization at 65°C for 24 hrs, we added 50 μl of DynaBeads M-270 Streptavidincoated paramagnetic beads (10 mg/ml) to selectively remove the biotinylated Agilent probes
and hybridized cDNA library fragments. The beads were washed according to
manufacturer’s protocol (Agilent) and the captured library fragments were released into
solution using 50 μl of 0.125 N NaOH and neutralized with an equal volume of
neutralization buffer (Agilent). The recovered fragments then were PCR amplified according
to the manufacturer’s protocol using 11 cycles in the PCR. Illumina library quantification
was completed using the KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Kit (KAPA Biosystems, Woburn, MA).
The qPCR result was used to determine the quantity of library necessary to produce 180,000
clusters on a single lane of the Illumina GAIIx. One lane of 100 bp paired-end data was
generated for each captured sample (since cDNA was used as the source for sequencing, we
refer to this process as cDNA Capture Sequencing or cDNA CapSeq). Illumina reads were
aligned to the NCBI build 37 (Mm9) mouse reference sequence using BWA29 v0.5.5 (with
−q 5 soft trimming). Alignments from multiple lanes for the same sample were merged
together using SAMtools r599, and duplicates were marked using Picard v1.29.
Mutation detection and annotation
Putative somatic mutations were identified using VarScan 2 (v2.2.4)30 with the parameters
“--min-coverage 3 --min-var-freq 0.08 --p-value 0.10 --somatic-p-value 0.05 --strand-filter
1” and specifying a minimum mapping quality of 10. Variants whose supporting reads

exhibited read position bias (average read position <10 or >90), strand bias (>99% of reads
on one strand), or mapping quality (score difference >30, or mismatch quality sum
difference >100) relative to reference supporting reads were removed as probable false
positives. We also required that the variant allele be present in at least 10% of tumour reads
and no more than 5% of normal reads. The single nucleotide variants (SNVs) meeting these
criteria were annotated using an internal database of Genbank/Ensembl transcripts
(v58_73k). In the event that a variant was annotated using multiple transcripts, the
annotation of most severe effect was used. Non-silent coding mutations (missense,
nonsense/nonstop, or splice-site) were prioritized for downstream analysis.
Mutation rate and overlap comparisons

Author Manuscript

Mutation rates were estimated for each tumour sample using the number of putative “tier 1”
SNVs (missense, nonsense/nonstop, splice site, silent, or noncoding RNA). To account for
variability in coverage between samples, the SNV count for each tumour sample (S) was
divided by a coverage factor (F), computed as the fraction of all tier 1 SNVs identified in
any tumour sample (n=16,991) that were covered by at least 4 reads in a given sample. For
example, in the d42m1 parental sample, 15,852 of 16,991 tier 1 SNV positions were
covered, for a coverage factor of 93.30%. The number of coverage-adjusted mutations in
each sample was divided by the total size of tier 1 space in the mouse genome (43.884 Mbp)
to determine the number of coding mutations per megabase (R).

Author Manuscript

For the mutation overlap comparisons and relatedness-to-parental-tumour analysis, only
high-confidence missense mutations were used (i.e., 20X or above). A mutation was
considered “shared” between two samples if both samples had a predicted mutation at the
same genomic position. For the comparison of mutated genes between d42m1 and H31m1
parental lines, a gene was considered “shared” if both d42m1 and H31m1 samples had a
predicted missense mutation in that gene, even if the mutations did not occur at the same
position.
Roche/454 sequencing and validation

Author Manuscript

PCR primers were designed for 11 SNVs predicted to be somatic in d42m1 tumour samples,
as well as 11 control sites which were H31m1-specific, low-confidence, or removed by the
false-positive filter. All 22 SNVs were PCR amplified individually in 11 samples (SK1.1,
d42m1, H31m1, T2, T3, T5, T9, T10, es1, es2, and es3) using MID-tailed primers to enable
sample identification. PCR products were pooled together prior to sequencing on ¼ run of
the Roche/454 Titanium platform. Read sequences and quality scores were extracted from
454 data files using sffinfo (454 proprietary software) then aligned to the mouse build 37
reference sequence (Mm19) using SSAHA2 v2.5.331 with the SAM output option.
Alignments were imported to BAM format and a “pileup” assembly file generated using
SAMtools v0.1.1832. The average 454 sequence depth for targeted positions was 1,216x per
sample. Validation read counts and allele frequencies in each sample at each variant position
were determined using the pileup2cns command of VarScan v2.2.730. At least 20 reads with

base quality of 20 or higher were required to confirm or refute a variant. 454 sequencing
data and the primers used are presented in Supplementary Table 4.
3730 sequencing and validation
Eight SNVs predicted to be somatic were selected for validation by PCR and 3730
sequencing in flow-sorted CD45+ and CD45− cells from the original d42m1 tumour.
Genomic DNA and cDNA from CD45− (tumour) cells, and cDNA from CD45+ (normal
immune) cells were used for PCR amplification and then PCR products were sequenced
individually on ABI 3730 using universal primers. Manual review was performed using
amplicon-based assembly in the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)33 to determine the
somatic status for each site. Data is presented in Supplementary Table 4.
MHC class I epitope prediction

Author Manuscript

All missense mutations for each d42m1-related tumour or H31m1 were analyzed for the
potential to form MHC class I neoepitopes that bind to either H-2Db or H-2Kb molecules.
The artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm provided by the Immune Epitope Database
and Analysis Resource (www.immuneepitope.org) was used to predict epitope binding
affinities20 and the results were ultimately expressed as “Affinity Values” (Affinity Value =
1/IC50 X 100). Predicted strong affinity epitopes expressed in d42m1 regressor tumours are
listed in Supplementary Table 5.
Phylogenetic analysis of tumour samples

Author Manuscript

Sequencing data from normal Rag2−/− fibroblasts, d42m1 parental cells, d42m1 regressor
clones, d42m1 progressor clones, d42m1 escape tumours, and H31m1 tumour cells were
compared using PHYLogeny Inference Package (PHYLIP)34 to generate a phylogenetic tree

Anti-H-2Kb (B8-24-3) and anti-H-2Db (B22/249) mAbs were generously provided by Dr.
Ted H. Hansen (Washington University School of Medicine). Anti-CD4 (GK1.5), antiCD8α (YTS169.4) mAbs and control immunoglobulin (PIP, a mAb specific for bacterial
glutathione S-transferase) were produced from hybridoma supernatants and purified in
endotoxin-free form by Protein G affinity chromatography (Leinco Technologies, St. Louis,
MO). Purified Rat IgG was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). CD45-FITC, CD45-PE,
CD8-APC, and purified anti-CD16/32 were purchased from BioLegend (San Diego, CA).
cDNA library construction and screening

Author Manuscript

To generate a d42m1 tumour cell cDNA library, mRNA was isolated from parental d42m1
tumour cells using a QuickPrep mRNA Purification kit (Amersham), converted into cDNA
using SuperScript II First Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) and inserted into the EcoRI
site of the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The cDNA library was divided into
pools of 100 bacterial colonies with 200–300 ng of DNA from each pool transfected into 2.5
x 104 monkey COS cells engineered to ectopically express mouse H-2Db (COS-Db) cells
using Lipofectamine 2000. After 48 hr, 5 x 103 C3 CTL cells were added, and supernatants

were assayed for IFN-γ release 24 hrs later by ELISA. A single positive cDNA clone was
isolated after screening 120,000 cDNA colonies. The putative H-2Db-binding peptide
VAVVNQIAL was predicted using the algorithm available at the Immune Epitope Database
and Analysis Resource, http://www.immuneeptiope.org/. The peptides were kindly produced
by Dr. Paul Allen and Steve Horvath (Washington University School of Medicine).
Expression vectors

Author Manuscript

Full length cDNA encoding wild type spectrin-β2 and mutant spectrin-β2 were cloned from
parental d42m1 tumour cells by RT-PCR using primer pairs 5′TGAGACAGTCAAGATGACGACCACGGTAGCCACA-3′ and 5′CGGGACAACAGGGAAGTTCACTTCTTCTTGCCGA-3′. Wild type and mutant spectrinβ2 cDNA were subcloned from the TOPO-XL vector (Invitrogen) into the RV-GFP
vector35. To generate the RV-RFP vector, full length cDNA encoding RFP was cloned from
the pTurboRFP-C vector (Evrogen) by RT-PCR using primer pairs 5′ATCTCAGAATTCATGAGCGAGCTGATCAAGGA - 3′ and 5′ATCTCAGGATCCTTATCTGTGCCCCAGTTTGCTAG - 3′. RFP cDNA was then cloned
into the RV vector. To remove candidate T cell epitopes in RFP, the nucleotide A was
replaced by G at position 334 in the cDNA, resulting in amino acid substitution N112D.
Coding sequences of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (Big Dye method;
Applied Biosciences). The dominant negative version of the IFNGR1 subunit (IFNGR1ΔIC)
was expressed into H31m1 and d42m1 tumour cells as previously described36.
Establishment of CTL lines and clones

Author Manuscript

To generate the d42m1 specific C3 CTL clone, wild type mice were injected with 1 x 106
parental d42m1 tumour cells. Fourteen days later, the spleen was harvested from a mouse
that rejected the tumour and a CTL line was established by stimulating 40 x 106 splenocytes
with 2 x 106 parental d42m1 tumour cells pre-treated for 48 hr with 100 U/ml of
recombinant murine IFN-γ and irradiated (100 Gy). After CD8+ T cell purification using
magnetic-beads (Miltenyi Biotec) and limiting dilution, the CTL clone C3 was obtained.
Measurement of IFN-γ production

Author Manuscript

To generate target cells, tumour cells were treated with 100 U/ml IFN-γ for 48 hrs and
irradiated with 100 Gy prior to use. The C3 CTL clone was co-cultured at the indicated
ratios with target tumour cells (10,000 or 5,000 cells) in 96-well round-bottomed plates
overnight. IFN-γ in supernatants was quantified using an IFN-γ ELISA kit (eBioscience).
For blocking assays, 10 μg/ml of α-CD8 (YTS-169.4), α-CD4 (GK1.5), or control
immunoglobulin (PIP) were added to the cell culture of effector (C3 CTL clone) and target
cells (tumours).
Cytotoxicity assay
To generate target cells, tumour cells were treated with 100 U/ml rMuIFN-γ for 48 hrs prior
to use. One million tumour cells were labeled with 25 μCi of Na251CrO4 (PerkinElmer,
Boston, MA) for 90 minutes at 37ºC, washed and 10,000 cells seeded per well in 96-well
round-bottom plates. The C3 CTL clone was co-cultured with the tumour target cells at the

indicated effector/target cell ratios and incubated for 4 hrs at 37ºC in 5% CO2. Radioactivity
was detected in the supernatants and percent specific killing was defined as (experimental
condition cpm - spontaneous cpm)/(maximal (detergent) cpm - spontaneous cpm) x 100.
Data points were obtained in duplicate.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis
For flow cytometry, cells were stained for 20 minutes at 4°C with 500 ng of Fc block (antiCD16/32) and 200 ng of CD45, CD4, or CD8α in 100 μL of staining buffer (PBS with 1%
FCS and 0.05% NaN3 (Sigma)). Propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma) was added at 1 μg/mL
immediately before FACS analysis. For quantitative analysis of tumour-infiltrating
lymphocytes/leukocytes (TIL) and lymph node populations, a CD45+PI− gate was used and
gated events were collected on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FloJo
software.

Tumour, draining lymph node, and spleen harvest
After tumour cell transplantation, established tumours were excised from mice, minced and
treated with 1 mg/ml type IA collagenase (Sigma) in HBSS (Hyclone) for 2 hrs at room
temperature. The ipsilateral inguinal tumour-draining lymph nodes and spleen were also
harvested and crushed between two glass slides and vigorously resuspended to make singlecell suspensions.
Tetramers
H-2Db tetramers conjugated to phycoerythrin (PE) were prepared with mutant spectrin-β2
peptides and produced by the NIH Tetramer Core Facility (Emory University, Atlanta, GA).

Author Manuscript

Mutation specific RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA from tumour cells was isolated by RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and cDNA was
synthesized from the total RNA using oligo (dT) primers and SuperScript II Reverse
Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR specific for wild type spectrin-β2, mutant
spectrin-β2 and GAPDH using the SYBR Green Mastermix kit (Applied Biosystems) were
performed on ABI 7000. The primer sequences for used for mutant spectrin-β2 are 5′GGTGAACCAGATTGCACT-3′ and 5′-TGTCCACCAGTTCTCTGAACT-3′.
Detection of mutation in spectrin-β2 cDNA

Author Manuscript

The point mutation in the spectrin-β2 gene creates a PstI restriction site (CGGCAG to
CTGCAG, underlined italic letters indicate the site of mutation). To amplify spectrin-β2
cDNA we used a forward primer (ACCCTGGCCCTGTACAAGAT) and reverse primer
(TAGACTCGATGACCTTGGTCT). The PCR conditions used were 94°C for 2 min,
followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30s, 55°C for 30s and 72°C for 30s. The PCR products
were digested for 2 hrs at 37°C with PstI restriction enzyme, which cleaved mutant spectrinβ2, but not wild-type spectrin-β2, and generates a 200 bp fragment from cDNA. The
products were resolved by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium
bromide staining.

Isolation of non-transformed cells from frozen primary d42m1 tumour biopsy

Author Manuscript

A frozen d42m1 tumour biopsy from the original d42m1 tumour was thawed and treated
with 1 mg/ml type IA collagenase (Sigma) in HBSS for 2 hrs at room temperature. After
filtration, single-cell suspensions were stained for 20 minutes at 4°C with 500 ng of Fc block
(anti-CD16/32) and 200 ng of CD45-PE in 100 μL of staining buffer. Propidium iodide was
added at 1 μg/mL immediately before sorting. A CD45+PI− gate was used and the top 15%
percent and the bottom 15% of gated events were collected using a FACSAria II (BD
Biosciences). Sorted CD45+ cells (host leukocytes) and CD45− cells (primary d42m1
tumour cells) were collected and genomic DNA as well as RNA was isolated to synthesize
cDNA for 3730 sequencing to validate that the mutation calls detected by Illumina were
somatic and tumour-specific.
