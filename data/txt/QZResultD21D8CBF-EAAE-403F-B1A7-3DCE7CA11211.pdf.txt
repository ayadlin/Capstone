ABSTRACT
Drug resistance is an important open problem in cancer treatment. In recent
years, the heat shock protein HSP27 (HSPB1) was identified as a key player
driving resistance development. HSP27 is overexpressed in many cancer types and
influences cellular processes such as apoptosis, DNA repair, recombination, and
formation of metastases. As a result cancer cells are able to suppress apoptosis
and develop resistance to cytostatic drugs. To identify HSP27 inhibitors we follow a
novel computational drug repositioning approach. We exploit a similarity between a
predicted HSP27 binding site to a viral thymidine kinase to generate lead inhibitors
for HSP27. Six of these leads were verified experimentally. They bind HSP27 and
down-regulate its chaperone activity. Most importantly, all six compounds inhibit
development of drug resistance in cellular assays. One of the leads – chlorpromazine
– is an antipsychotic, which has a positive effect on survival time in human breast
cancer. In summary, we make two important contributions: First, we put forward six
novel leads, which inhibit HSP27 and tackle drug resistance. Second, we demonstrate
the power of computational drug repositioning.

INTRODUCTION

at specific stages of development and differentiation.
In malignant cells, HSP27 expression correlates with
the oncogenic status of the cell and has a role in their
tumorigenicity. HSP27 is up-regulated across many types
of cancer; including breast [1], colorectal [2], liver [3],
tongue [4], bladder [5], eye [6], ovarian [7], and pancreas
[8]. HSP27 is not just up-regulated in cancer cells, but
it is specifically implicated in the development of drug
resistance. Kuramitsu et al. show that increased HSP27
expression is related to higher rates of Gemcitabine
resistance in pancreatic cancer cells [9]. In multiple
myeloma, Chauhan et al. report that cells resistant to
dexamethasone (Dex) overexpress HSP27 and that Dexresistance can be overcome by inhibition of HSP27 [10].
For bladder cancer, Kamada et al. found that HSP27
overexpression is related to paclitaxel resistance and
increased UMUC-3 cell growth [5]. Zhang et al. identified
up-regulation of HSP27 in the doxorubicin-resistant,
ERp29 over-expressing MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell

Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are evolutionarily
conserved molecules synthesized by cells in response to
heat or chemical stress. Acting as molecular chaperones,
HSPs protect cells from environmental stress damage by
stabilizing native folding of proteins. In addition, they help
to sequester severely damaged proteins for degradation.
HSPs are found to be overexpressed in a wide range of
cancers. Members of the HSP family have been implicated
in cancer resilience by promoting tumor cell proliferation as
well as inhibiting cell death pathways. HSP27 in particular
is emerging as a promising target in cancer therapy.

line [11]. Similar findings regarding drug resistance apply
to prostate, pancreatic, and ovarian cancer [7, 12].
In summary, HSP27 overexpression is documented
in over 10 cancer types and has been linked to resistance to
more than 10 different cytotoxic agents [1, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13].
Therefore, Mori-Iwamoto observed that silencing of
HSP27 reduces drug resistance [14]. Interestingly, there is
evidence for the converse: In testis cancer, Richards et al.
found HSP27 at low levels and observed an unusually
good response to chemo- and radiation therapy [15]. As a
conclusion, many authors agree that targeting HSP27 is a
promising anti-cancer strategy.

A computational drug repositioning pipeline to
predict HSP27 binders
Computational drug repositioning identifies
novel targets and indications for existing drugs using
bioinformatics databases and algorithms. Here, we
pursued a structural approach, which exploits similarities
between binding sites in otherwise unrelated target
proteins to predict novel binders. Concretely, in previous
work [25] we discovered a surprising connection between
cancer and herpes, between HSP27 and a viral thymidine
kinase (VTK). A 3D structural model of HSP27 and a
crystalized structure of VTK showed a similar binding site
with five identical residues in exactly the same geometric
confirmation (see Figure 2A). Two of these residues are
phenylalanines, which can coordinate aromatic rings
of ligands in a very stable sandwich-like complex (pistacking). In [25], we showed computationally and
experimentally that this shared binding site is capable of
binding the ligand BVDU. Therefore BVDU is not only
an anti-viral herpes drug, but also a candidate cancer drug.
In this work, we generalize this hypothesis. If one VTK
ligand binds HSP27, so may others.
We tested this hypothesis through the following
computational pipeline: We collected 115 ligands
binding viral thymidine kinases and further expanded
this set to 228 ligands considering non-viral thymidine
kinases (Figure 1, step 2). Next, we tested ligand binding
computationally by docking ligands into the thymidine
kinase and the HSP27 pocket, respectively (Figure 1,
step 3). Since our goal is an improvement over the known
HSP27 inhibitor BVDU, we kept only those 29 ligands,
which obtained better docking scores than BVDU. Finally,
we selected six ligands for experimental validation
(Figure 1, step 4).

Targeting HSP27
For head and neck squamous cell cancer, glioma,
breast and lung cancer stem cells there is evidence of a
positive effect after inhibition of HSP27. Silencing of
the HSP27 gene led to decreased metastatic behavior of
human head and neck squamous cell cancer cells in vitro
[16]. In glioma, the inhibition of HSP27 alone or in
combination with a pAKT inhibitor has been described as
a promising therapy approach in SPARC-induced glioma
cells [17]. HSP27 has been described as a target in breast
cancer therapy and the role of HSP27 in the maintenance
of breast cancer stem cells was pointed out by Wei et al.
[18]. The combination of HSP90 and HSP27 inhibitors
to enhance the suppressive effect in breast cancer stemlike cells was proposed by Lee et al. [19] and decreased
survival of lung cancer stem cells – otherwise resistant to
chemotherapy – has been demonstrated by Hsu et al. using
Quercetin to down-regulate HSP27 expression [20].

HSP27 and apoptosis
HSP27 is such a promising target, as it protects
cells against apoptotic cell death triggered by a variety
of stimuli including hyperthermia, oxidative stress,
staurosporine, Fas ligand and cytotoxic drugs [21]. It
regulates apoptosis through interaction with STAT3 [22],
CYC1 (Cytochrome c-1) [23], and CASP3 (Pro-Caspase 3)
[24]. In previous work on target identification, we have
shown that the herpes drug BVDU binds to HSP27.
BVDU restores apoptosis by inhibiting the interaction
of HSP27 with pro-apoptotic proteins. Our experiments
showed that with BVDU binding to HSP27, there was less
AKT1, CASP3, and CYC1, respectively, bound to HSP27.
These findings confirmed the inhibitory effect of BVDU
on HSP27 and its activating effect on apoptosis [25].
In summary, HSP27 regulates apoptosis and is linked
to drug resistance in numerous cancers. Thus, modulating
the activity of HSP27 is a promising approach to tackle
drug resistance in cancer [12]. Our goal is to deploy a
computational pipeline to discover selective, efficient, and
experimentally validated HSP27 inhibitors to counteract
resistance development in cancer chemotherapy.

Binding site similarity between HSP27 and VTK
Consider Figure 2A. At the source of the
computational drug repositioning pipeline is a shared
binding site between a herpes thymidine kinase and
HSP27. Strikingly, five residues are geometrically in
the same arrangement. The two key residues are two
phenylalanine residues, whose rings can coordinate the
BVDU ring in a sandwich-like structure involving pistacking. Additionally, the other three residues mediate
characteristic interactions.

228 thymidine kinase ligands may bind HSP27
Our drug repositioning hypothesis is that the above
binding site similarity implies that ligands of thymidine
kinases may bind HSP27. We collected TK binders in two
stages. First, we obtained 115 ligands by retrieving herpes

thymidine kinases from UniProt [26] and their ligands from
BindingDB and TTD [27, 28]. We further expanded this set
by considering non-herpes thymidine kinases. To avoid the
introduction of too much noise, we inspected the binding
sites of the non-herpes thymidine kinases. Thus, we collected
non-herpes thymidine kinase sequences from UniProt and

mapped these to PDB, obtaining 12 structures. Figure 2B
shows the eight structures that have a similar binding site
to VTK, which is placed at the center of Figure 2B. The
structures cover bacteria, but also fruit fly (Drosophila)
and human. For these eight structures, we found another
113 ligands, so that there are 228 ligands in total.

Docking scores of VTK and HSP27 correlate

Most of the 29 lead HSP27 inhibitors are new

Next, we docked these 228 ligands against the VTK
and the HSP27 binding sites, respectively. Figure 2C
shows the computed binding affinities as scatter plot on a
log scale. If the scores perfectly agree, there is no need to
dock against both binding sites. If they disagree strongly,
then the binding site similarity is too weak. However,
we find a good agreement with a statistically significant
correlation of 0.84 at a p-value of less than 10−16. As a
key step we selected now those ligands, which show
a higher computed binding affinity than BVDU in both
binding sites. BVDU (the known ligand of both) docked
with an affinity of Ki = 10−2.46 on HSP27 and Ki = 10−4.45
on VTK. A total of 29 ligands achieved better affinities
(see Supplementary Figure S1).

Often derivatives of ligands have similar or even
better binding properties than the original drug. One
could expect that the 29 ligands, which are better than
BVDU, are direct derivatives of BVDU. However, they
are not. To understand how the 29 compounds relate to
each other structurally, we used chemical fingerprints,
which represent key features of the compound structures
and which make them directly comparable. Figure 2D
shows these pairwise similarities as a heat map. The red
rectangles in Figure 2D indicate groups of structurally
related compounds. Overall, there are six groups of
compounds: BVDU-, thymidine-, thymine-, deoxyuridine-,
guanine-, and furo-pyrimidinone-derivatives, as well
as a single phenothiazine, and a pyrimidine piperazine.

Figure 2: VTK and HSP27. (A) Viral thymidine kinase (green) and HSP27 (blue) share a similar binding site with five residues of

very similar conformation. BVDU (orange) binds both VTK and HSP27. (B) Eight non-viral thymidine kinases (grouped around the
central viral thymidine kinase) share a similar binding site to VTK. Overall, there are 228 ligands binding the viral and the non-viral TKs.

chemically dissimilar.

Interestingly, only three compounds are direct derivatives
of BVDU. However, the deoxyuridine-, thymidine-, and
thymine derivatives can be related to BVDU. There is
a progression starting from BVDU via the compounds
6 and 16 to the thymidine derivatives. While the heat map
in Figure 2D grouped compounds 6 and 16 with other
thymidine derivatives, the Supplementary Figure S2A
shows that they comprise the bromovinyl group and can
therefore be considered BVDU derivatives. In a next
step, the thymidine derivatives are structurally related
to the thymine derivatives. These structural changes
and variations are not obvious. First of all, starting from
BVDU one would expect the bromovinyl group of BVDU
to play a critical role in binding to Hsp27. However,
considering Supplementary Figure S2A, the transition
from BVDU derivatives via compound 6 and 16 to the
thymidine derivatives shows that the bromovinyl group
can be replaced by a methyl group. This replacement
goes hand in hand with a best rank of 23 for the BVDU
derivatives to 3 for the thymidine derivatives. In the next
step from thymidine derivatives to thymine derivatives,
the deoxy sugar is replaced by a linker and the triazole,
which mimics the amide group, is replaced by an amide
group. Thus, the hydrophobic part of the compound
is increased. Again, ranks improve to the top rank 1.
Overall, the compounds in Figure S2A can be related
to BVDU, although only indirectly via non-obvious
changes. However, the 11 compounds in Figure S2B are
unrelated to BVDU. Most importantly, there are guanine
and furo-pyrimidinone derivatives. The guanine group
comprises four closely related compounds and therefore
sheds light on the possibilities for modification and its
relation to activity. In contrast, the furo-pyrimidinone
group provides little insight into the possibility for activity
improvement. Finally, the group of single, completely
unrelated compounds contains a sedative used in animals,
acepromazine (compound 4).

[30, 31]. Finally, we selected one of the single compounds,
acepromazine, as it is in use in animals as a sedative
and antiemetic. Acepromazine is very closely related to
chlorpromazine, an FDA-approved antipsychotic drug used
in humans, which we added for this reason to the selection.
To validate the six compounds we subjected them
to three different tests: First, we checked for binding to
HSP27. Second, we investigated the impact of binding on
HSP27’s function as chaperone. Third and most important,
we tested whether and how strongly the compounds reduce
resistance development in cancer cell lines. The results of
these three experiments are summarized in Table 1 and
discussed in detail below.

Five out of six lead inhibitors bind to HSP27
The SpeedScreen technique (see Methods) allows
differentiation between binders and non-binders because
small molecules, whose weight is below 5 KDa, will not
pass through Sephadex G-25 Spin columns unless they
are bound to a bigger molecule such as HSP27. Only
passing molecules can subsequently be detected by mass
spectroscopy.
Using the SpeedScreen we tested the six lead
compounds, the negative control, and BVDU. Consider
Table 2: Five of the six lead compounds bind HSP27
at concentrations ranging from 0.04 to 0.89 μM. As
expected, the negative control Indomethacin does not
bind. However, unexpectedly, BVDU and chlorpromazine
cannot be detected. Since the two subsequent experiments
for BVDU and chlorpromazine are positive, and since
BVDU has been independently shown to bind HSP27 with
a pull down assay [25], we conclude that this negative
result is not due to non-binding of the two compounds,
but rather due to the limits of the experimental method.

All lead compounds inhibit HSP27’s chaperone
activity

Selection of compounds for experimental
validation

HSP27 acts as chaperone and helps client proteins
to remain correctly folded under stress conditions. In the
absence of functional HSP27, one such client protein,
citrate synthase (CS), misfolds and forms aggregates
when denatured by heat. Misfolded CS forms aggregates,
so that light scattering detected with a spectrometer is
an effective method to measure aggregation. Consider
Figure 3A: The graph shows light scattering over time
for two controls (CS on its own and with HSP27), with
BVDU at 750 μM, and one lead compound (CAS 16136317-3) at 14 and 28 μM, respectively. With CS alone the
graph peaks after 15 minutes, whereas HSP27 keeps
CS correctly folded over the whole course of an hour.
BVDU (750 µM) and the lead compound (CAS 16136317-3) at 14 μM show a strong rise after 40 minutes. At
28 μM, the lead compound has an even more pronounced
effect rising to 200 after 30 minutes. The inhibition of

Based on structural considerations, on position in
the ranking, and on availability, we chose six compounds
for experimental validation. As shown in Figure 2B and
Figure S2A the thymine derivatives 1 and 10 are indirect
derivatives of BVDU, which are the most distant to
BVDU and which scored well in the ranking (1 and 10).
Originally, these compounds were developed as human
mitochondrial thymidine kinase inhibitors [29].
Among the compounds unrelated to BVDU, we
chose the guanine derivatives 7 and 26, because of their
ranking at the top and bottom of the list and because of
the possibilities for later improvements of the compounds.
For this latter reason, we did not choose any of the furopyrimidinones at this stage. Compounds 7 and 26 were
developed originally as inhibitors of Herpes simplex

Based on chemical class, position in the ranking, and availability, six ligands were selected for experimental testing. Four ligands were specifically developed
as thymidine kinase inhibitors, one is a sedative in use for animals, and one is an antipsychotic in humans. Additionally, a negative control and BVDU are
tested. The six lead ligands perform significantly better than BVDU. Five out of six bind to Hsp27 in the SpeedScreen, all six inhibit chaperone activity better
than BVDU (50–80 times), and all six reduce drug resistance development significantly. Structures of the compounds are depicted in Supplementary Figure S2.

HSP27 correlates with the affinity of the respective
small molecule with the binding pocket of HSP27. The
light scattering assay does not provide quantitative
measurement regarding the amount of protein aggregates.
Therefore, we carried out a centrifugation-based assay to
quantify the client protein citrate synthase in precipitates.
Table 3 summarizes the results of the functional assay by
quantifying the amount of precipitated citrate synthase in
the presence of HSP27 and compares the inhibitory effect
of lead compounds with BVDU. All six leads effectively
inhibit HSP27’s chaperone activity. Comparing to
BVDU, there is an improved HSP27 inhibition of roughly
50–80 times.

Numerous failures in chemotherapy are due to the
rapid resistance development of cancer cells to cytostatic
therapy. Resistant cancer cells produce more HSP27,
which inhibits apoptotic proteins, thus retarding their
demise and creating resistance. Bortezomib is a cytostatic
whose HSP27-driven development of resistance is well
documented [10]. Multiple myeloma cell line, RPMI-8226,
was selected because Bortezomib is an FDA approved
therapeutic in this cancer. RPMI-8226 cells respond to
Bortezomib, express HSP27, and develop Bortezomib68161

One lead, acepromazine, performs 5-6 fold better than BVDU (30 µM) at one fortieth of the dosage.
Figure 3B shows a treatment using 0.75 µM
acepromazine, which significantly inhibits resistance
formation towards Bortezomib. Only 30,000 cells/ml
medium remained after three passages of acepromazine
treatment. In comparison, 160,000 cells/ml remained
using 30 µM BVDU and 350,000 cells/ml remained for
the Bortezomib-only treatment without HSP27 inhibitor.
Thus, acepromazine caused a tenfold reduction in living
cells compared to Bortezomib-only. In comparison to
BVDU, acepromazine leaves 5 times less living cells at a
40 times lower concentration.
Table 4 summarizes the results on drug resistance
for all compounds. All lead compounds reduce resistance
development significantly at much lower concentrations
than BVDU. Detailed graphs can be found in the

the lead compounds are already in use in animals and
in humans, respectively (see discussion below), which
implies that they are also non-toxic in vivo.

DISCUSSION
HSP27 inhibitors are rare
Despite HSP27’s importance as cancer target,
there are – to the best of our knowledge – currently only
two cancer therapy approaches targeting HSP27 under
clinical investigation. One is the experimental antisense
oligonucleotide Apatorsen (OGX-427) by Oncogenex.
Apatorsen has been investigated in several clinical
trials in different tumor types according to the U. S.
National Institute of Health (clinicaltrials.gov). Chi et al.
published promising preliminary results in a phase 1
dose finding study using OGX-427 (clinicaltrials.gov
ID NCT00487786). The authors reported decreased tumor
markers and less circulating tumor cells in castration
resistant prostate cancer and other advanced cancers [32].
Squamous cell lung cancer patients are currently recruited
to study Apatorsen in combination with Gemcitabine
and Carboplatin. Lelj-Garolla et al. observed erlontinibresistance related to increased HSP27 levels in HCC827
and A549 NSLC cell lines and presented preclinical
evidence that inhibition of HSP27 using OGX-427 in
combination with erlontinib treatment or cytotoxic drugs
enhanced antitumor activity and delayed A549 xenograft
growth in mice [33].
The second approach relates to BVDU, which forms
the core of our drug repositioning pipeline. BVDU directly
binds HSP27 and showed promising results in an in vivo
study on rats and a phase I study with 20 patients [25].
However, a phase II clinical trial did not lead to consistent
results. Since the six compounds put forward in this paper
are chemically distinct from BVDU they may overcome
the problems leading to inconsistent results for BVDU.

All lead compounds are non-toxic
The positive effect reported above, could be simply
due to the toxicity of the lead compounds. If this was
true, the lead compounds would show this positive effect
independent of the co-treatment with the cytotoxic drug.
As a consequence, the lead compounds would not be
suitable as co-treatment in cancer therapy. To address this
problem, we ran the resistance assay without cytotoxic
treatment. I.e. we compared the cell growth of untreated
cells to cells treated with one of the lead compounds on its
own. As a control, we also tested BVDU on its own. These
results are summarized in Supplementary Figure S5. Over
the course of two to four weeks, there is no difference
in cell growth between untreated and treated cells in the
control group. This means, that the lead compounds and
also BVDU only are not toxic. They unfold their effect
of reducing cell growth only together with the cytotoxic

binding to VTK beyond pi-stacking is therefore a promising
screening approach for new compounds beyond TK binders.
On a more general note, docking the small and
targeted compound library derived from the knowledge of
the remotely similar binding site of HSP27 and VTK, is a
key step for the successful.

At the heart of this study is a structural model of
HSP27. Roughly half of HSP27 consists of a stable alphacrystallin domain and half of an unstable unstructured
region. The alpha-crystallin domain, which is highly
conserved [34], was crystalized at 2.2A resolution [35],
but the unstable region eludes crystallization. HSP27
models – including our own [25] - have been put forward
[36], but are questionable due to the instability of the
unstructured region. Unfortunately, the predicted binding
site [25] is in the unstructured region. Even worse, it
comprises the flexible terminus. However, Heinrich et al.
showed that mutating one of the two key phenylalanines
does not prevent BVDU binding and mutating both does.
The results presented in this paper give further support that
the originally identified binding site is correctly predicted.
It remains an interesting open question how the predicted
binding site relates to oligomerization interfaces of HSP27.

Old drugs, new drugs
Drug repositioning has the advantage of generating
new features for known compounds, which are more easily
available and which are characterized already. However, they
may not be the optimal inhibitors. For the compounds we
identified it may be promising to identify common structural
patterns and to derive from these patterns novel compounds
with even more advantageous binding properties. As
mentioned in the results, our analysis shows that BVDU’s
bromovinyl group is not essential for HSP27 inhibition and
that a number of different linkers and ring structures are
possible opening up many avenues for future improvements.

Docking of lead binders

New classes of inhibitors not related to BVDU

Recently, Irwin et al. summarized how docking can
be used in drug repositioning [37]. The authors argue that
such an in silico approach is on a par with experimental
high-throughput screening. Additionally, it can be
scaled up by increasing computing power and it only
requires models of the ligands, but not the ligand itself
as substance. Here, we pursue such a docking approach
to reduce the original ligand list of 228 to 29. Ligand
docking has to be considered carefully as in silico and
experimental poses and binding affinities often disagree.
As a consequence, Irwin et al. mention hit rates of 10%
over large libraries [37]. Therefore, a key contribution of
this paper is the generation of a very small, targeted library
of chemically diverse compounds, which led to a hit rate
of 100%. The crucial step for the small size of the library
was the exploitation of the shared binding site.
For docking, we chose AutoDock, as it is very widely
used with competitive performance [38]. We evaluated
AutoDock’s scores for the TK binding site against
experimental affinities obtained from BindingDB [27]
and found a weak correlation of 0.31 (see Supplementary
Figure S3A). This means that it is likely that the 199
compounds with lower docking scores than BVDU may
still contain good inhibitors. However, for this analysis
they were not considered. We also manually inspected
AutoDock poses for the selected compounds and found e.g.
that acepromazine uses pi-stacking in the AutoDock pose
for VTK and for HSP27 (see Supplementary Figure S3B).
This preservation of a molecular interaction type further
supports the high scores of acepromazine and the positive
experimental results. At the same time, it must be noted
that pi-stacking on its own is a very general interaction
pattern and many binding sites in the PDB use pi-stacking.
A detailed definition of the key interactions defining BVDU

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

A key contribution of this paper is a change in
perspective for drug development. Starting from the lead
compound BVDU we did not generate and test derivatives
of BVDU, but instead we uncovered the binding
mechanism and exploited the detour via a remote binding
site similarity between HSP27 and VTK to generate lead
compounds. These leads are largely independent of BVDU
and while they are mostly nucleoside analogues they also
cover very different classes such as furo-pyrimidinones
and the phenothiazine acepromazine. This approach
has the additional advantage that it maps out a larger
compound space covering more and different chemical
properties besides the target binding. This approach to
repositioning is general and can be applied to any scenario
where suitable structural data is available.

Chlorpromazine in cancer
Acepromazine emerged as a compound that ranked
highly in the in silico pipeline and proved successful in
all three experimental assays covering binding, function,
and resistance development. Since acepromazine is used
in animals, we also investigated its twin chlorpromazine
used in humans. Chlorpromazine is also a phenothiazine
with antipsychotic effect. It blocks postsynaptic dopamine
receptors in cortical and limbic areas of the brain and in the
chemical trigger zone. The former reduces hallucinations and
delusions, while the latter is used as a sedative in animals and
appears to exert antiemetic activity [39]. Chlorpromazine has
also been used as antipsychotic drug to treat pain and side
effects in advanced cancer [40]. There are reports dating
back over 40 years, which suggest that psychiatric patients

taking chlorpromazine have lower incidence of breast cancer
[41]. Recently, Yde et al. corroborated this observation by
showing that chlorpromazine enhances the cytotoxic effect
of tamoxifen in tamoxifen-resistant human breast cancer
cells [42]. The beneficial effect has also been found in
colorectal cancer [43].

the protein structure and identifying lead inhibitors using
an in silico approach, we have applied speed-screening
and centrifugation-based precipitation quantification
assay to validate the protein-ligand interaction in solution.
The experimental characterization has not only confirmed
the binding property from in silico prediction, but also
paved the way for designing a high throughput screening
campaign against HSP27 chaperone activity.

HSP27 as a therapeutic target independent of
chemotherapy

MATERIALS AND METHODS

While we focus on HSP27 inhibition as a cotreatment to cytotoxic drugs, there is evidence emerging
that down-regulation of HSP27 - independent of cytotoxic
compounds - induces long-term dormancy of angiogenic
breast cancer cells [44]. Consistently, up-regulation
of HSP27 in previously non-angiogenic cells induced
expansive tumor growth in vivo. The study was carried out
in a mouse model. These results show that the compounds
put forward here may not only act as co-treatment, but
may have the potential as cancer drugs on their own.

VTK and non-VTK compounds
The Uniprot query thymidine and kinase and
reviewed:yes and organism:”Human herpesvirus” returned
13 herpes thymidine kinase sequences. The drug-target
databases BindingDB, DrugBank, PDB, and TTD returned
115 compounds binding to those. BindingDB provided
affinity scores for 83 of them. Similarly, the query thymidine
and kinase and reviewed:yes and not organism:”Human
herpesvirus” returned 241 results (both queries were run
on 30/05/2011), for which there were twelve structures in
the PDB. Eight of these non-viral thymidine kinases have
a binding site similar to the BVDU binding site of the viral
thymidine kinase in PDB ID 1OSN. Similarity was defined
through the structure comparison tool SMAP [46] obtaining
a p-value of 10−3 or better. For these eight non-viral TKs
BindingDB , DrugBank, PDB, and TTD list 113 compounds.
BindingDB provided affinity scores for 41 of them.

Understanding chaperone function
It is an open question how small heat shock
proteins function as chaperones. The tertiary and
quaternary structures of HSP27 are important to
answer this question. While the structure of the highly
conserved alpha-crystallin domain is solved [34, 35],
there is no tertiary or quaternary structure of full length
HSP27. For the latter, Stengel et al. [45] investigate the
dynamics of oligomerization and found a large number
of heterogeneous stoichiometries, which – they argue –
is an integral part of HSP function. The compounds we
identified inhibit HSP27’s function as chaperone. Thus,
they may provide valuable information to advance the
understanding of the dynamic oligomerization process
observed by van Montfort et al. [34].

Docking
The compounds were docked to the viral thymidine
kinase PDB ID 1OSN [47] and the model of HSP27
used in [25] with AutoDock 4.2 (rigid body docking)
[48]. AutoDockTools (ver.1.5.4) was used to add polar
hydrogen partial charges and Autodock atom types.
AutoGrid 4 was used to build two grid boxes (66 × 60
× 60 A) and (50 × 60 × 50 A) with 0.375 A spacing for
the respective proteins. The docking calculations were
performed using the Lamarckian genetic algorithm
procedure with the following parameters: a maximum
number of energy evaluations (evals 5,000,000), an
initial population of 150 randomly placed individuals, a
maximum number of 27,000 generations, a mutation rate
of 0.02, a cross-over rate of 0.80 and an elitism value
(number of top individuals that automatically survive)
of 1. For the local search, the Soils and Wets algorithm
was applied to a maximum of 300 iterations per search.
Thirty independent docking runs were carried out for each
compound. Using Autodock 4, compound poses were
clustered based on their Root Mean Square Deviation
(RMSD) values. Finally, the change in Gibbs energy (ΔG)
is estimated by Autodock and used to calculate binding
affinities with the following equation: Ki = e −ΔG / R T.

Alternative methods to tackle difficult target
proteins
Some proteins are very interesting targets because
of their biomedical relevance, however, it is difficult to
apply common methods in drug discovery to identify
and characterize inhibitory compounds. In case of the
small molecular chaperone HSP27, probably because of
its intrinsic structural dynamics, no crystal structure of
full-length protein is available. Because of the lack of
method to quantify protein aggregates, no high throughput
assay has been established for drug screening campaigns.
Moreover, its promiscuous binding to various client
proteins also causes its non-specific interaction with
biosensor chip surface, thus it is difficult for conventional
on chip validation method (e.g. surface plasma resonance
and interferometry). In this work, in addition to modeling

Chemical similarity

Functional assay

Chemical compound similarity was computed
with PubChem: pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ assay/
assay.cgi?p=clustering. Compounds are represented
as fingerprints of chemical features. The similarity is
expressed as Tanimoto coefficient, i.e. the number of shared
features divided by the number of the union of features. A
Tanimoto score of 0.9 or better is considered similar.

To test how the test compounds affect the
chaperone activity of HSP27, we measured misfolding
and aggregation of citrate synthase, a well-known in vitro
client protein of HSP27. Citrate synthase misfolds and
aggregates when exposed to heat shock conditions at
43°C. This heat denaturation is prevented or delayed by
the presence of HSP27 [50]. The effectiveness of the test
compounds can thus be measured by inhibition of the
HSP27 chaperone function. To determine the influence
on the aggregation behavior of citrate synthase (CS) at
43°C we used 1.44 µM CS, 481 nM HSP27 (HSP) in a
40 mmol / L HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) and provided BVDU
(750 µM) as a positive control and various concentrations
of the respective new HSP27 inhibitor (typically 10 µM).
The samples were incubated at 43°C and the aggregation
behavior of CS was monitored in a spectrometer
(PerkinElmer LS55) at a wavelength of 500 nm.

Capillary electrophoresis of CS precipitates

Expression and purification of HSP27
recombinant protein

The heat-denatured protein aggregates produced
by the aggregation assay are water-insoluble and can
be separated from the supernatant by centrifugation at
16.000 × g for 10 min at room temperature.  Precipitated
proteins (CS and HSP27) were visualized and quantified
using capillary electrophoresis (Beckman PA800). The
amount of precipitated CS is an indirect measure for the
efficiency of the respective HSP27 inhibitor. The relative
amount of precipitated citrate synthase was normalized
over a defined amount of BSA as an internal standard.
The relative amount of citrate synthase precipitated in the
presence of 750 µM BVDU was set equal to 1. The other
test substances were used at a concentration of 10 µM.

To test the predicted HSP27 inhibitors HIS-tagged
recombinant HSP27 protein was synthesized using
the E. coli BL21(DE3) strain. The HSP27 expression
plasmid was built upon the pRSET A expression vector
(Invitrogen). The HSP27 DNA sequence was codon
optimized for expression in E. coli. Recombinant HSP27
protein was purified using HIS-traps and subsequently
Superdex75 columns (GE Healthcare) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Binding assay: SpeedScreen

Resistance assay

The SpeedScreen [49] uses Sephadex columns,
which let bigger molecules (compound bound to HSP27)
pass and smaller (less than 5000g/Mol) ones (compound
not bound to HSP27) not. We used PD G-25 SpinTraps
(GE Healthcare). The compounds were incubated with
HSP27 in 40 mM Hepes, pH 7,4 for 10 min at room
temperature and loaded in an appropriate volume of the
mixture on a PD G-25 SpinTrap. In parallel another Spin
Trap was loaded with the same test compound without the
protein. After centrifugation the eluates were analyzed
by MS/MS to see if the compounds were carried through
the spin traps. Unbound compounds should be retained
by the Sephadex G-25 Spin Trap. A Waters ACQUITY
TQD System was used for characterization and detection.
MS/MS methods for the respective test compounds were
developed using the IntelliStart™ Software in order to
enhance sensitivity and selectivity. Compounds that were
carried through the Sephadex G-25 Spin Traps by HSP27
were detected using LC-ESI-MSMS.

RPMI-8226 cells, a human multiple myeloma cell
line, were obtained from DSMZ (Leibniz Institute DSMZGerman Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures).
Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (FG 1235;
Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 10%
(v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in a humidified
atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37°C. Logarithmically
growing cells were seeded at a density of 100,000 cells/ml
and incubated with Bortezomib (Velcade) in combination
with or without HSP27 inhibitors. Cells were periodically
counted using C-Chip Neubauer-improved counting
chambers (Peqlab) and serially passaged. Cells were
always kept below 1,000,000 cells per ml and typically
passaged when cell count reached 800,000 cells per ml.
The starting dose of Bortezomib was typically 0.1 ng/ml.
The dose of Bortezomib was increased each passage, e.g.:
1st passage 0.1 ng/ml Bortezomib, 2nd passage 0.2 ng/ml
Bortezomib, 3rd passage 0.3 ng/ml Bortezomib.
68166

In parallel cells were treated with Bortezomib plus
30 µM BVDU as a positive control and with Bortezomib
plus the respective HSP27 compound (typically 1 µM or
lower). The dose of BVDU and the new HSP27 inhibitors
remained unchanged throughout the experiment. Untreated
cells, BVDU-only, and test compound-only treatments
served as controls. Treatment with 30 µM BVDU or
0.5–1 µM of the respective HSP27 inhibitor test
compound did not influence cell growth. The dose of the
test compounds was defined in dose finding experiments
beforehand to determine the functional but non-toxic
dose. U-937 cells (histiocytic lymphoma) were treated as
described above for the RPMI-8226 cell line.

Especially, the functional assay is suitable for higher
throughput and may be taken up by others to improve
our understanding of chaperone function and cancer.
In a nutshell, docking with a targeted compound
library led to six novel compounds, which suppress
chemoresistance in cancer cells.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

CONCLUSIONS

The authors declare no conflicts of interest.

In conclusion, the heat shock protein HSP27 is
overexpressed in many cancers and associated with
resistance development against cytotoxic drugs. Thus,
inhibitors of HSP27 may improve cancer chemotherapy
as co-treatment together with cytotoxic drugs. This
paper presents three key contributions: First, exploiting
a shared binding site of HSP27 and VTK we were
able to generate a very small and targeted library for
in silico docking, which led to a 100% success rate in
the subsequent experimental validation. The principle is
general and can be applied to other drug discovery tasks.
Second, we identified and validated six lead compounds
that are significantly better binders and functional
modulators of HSP27 than currently known HSP27
inhibitors. Furthermore, these inhibitors require much
lower doses, which will be an important advantage in
future experiments in animals and in humans. The key
contribution relates to the chemical diversity of the
identified compounds. Because, although the original
compound library for the in silico screening was small,
it did not just contain derivatives of the known HSP27
binder BVDU, but covered instead a wide variety
of chemically very different compounds. Together
with the experimental validation, this means that the
novel HSP27 inhibitors map out the space of possible
inhibitors and shed more light on the true mode of
action for HSP27 inhibition. In particular, these findings
mean that bromovinyl group of BVDU is not necessary
for HSP27 inhibition. An important aspect for future
improvement of cancer therapy is, that the compounds
are not toxic. Our results show that the lead compounds
suppress resistance development only in combination
with the cytotoxic treatment and show no effect on
their own. Additionally, two of the compounds are in
use in animals and humans, respectively, which means
they are non-toxic in vivo, too. The third contribution
relates to the assays developed. Heat shock proteins
are important and so is their inhibition. The established
assays are novel for heat shock proteins and shed light
onto binding, function, and resistance suppression.
