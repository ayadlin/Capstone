Phosphomimetic Mutants of Pigment Epithelium-Derived
Factor with Enhanced Antiangiogenic Activity as Potent
Anticancer Agents
Alexander Konson, Sunila Pradeep, and Rony Seger

Abstract
Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis and a promising
anticancer agent capable of suppressing solid tumor growth in animal cancer models. We have previously
shown that PEDF can be phosphorylated and that distinct phosphorylation states of this factor differentially
regulate its physiologic function. Here, we report that phosphomimetic mutants of PEDF, which possess significantly increased antiangiogenic activity, are much more efficient than wild-type (WT) PEDF in inhibiting
growth and neovascularization in MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer), HCT116 (colon cancer), and U87-MG (glioblastoma) xenograft models. Importantly, the antitumor activity of the phosphomimetic mutants is comparable with that of the established antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab. However, unlike bevacizumab, these
compounds act in a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)–independent manner, as they do not affect
the levels of VEGF-A mRNA and VEGF receptor 2 phosphorylation. Further immunohistochemical analysis
revealed that PEDF mutants affect mainly tumor-residing endothelial cells and prevent the formation of intratumoral vascular network by facilitating endothelial cell apoptosis. It was also found that PEDF mutants
reduce survival of endothelial cells in culture much better than WT-PEDF, an effect that is apparent even in
the presence of VEGF or basic fibroblast growth factor, and promote much stronger endothelial cell apoptosis. On the other hand, PEDF and its mutants did not affect survival of cultured cancer cells, indicating that
the antiangiogenic activity of these agents is the foremost element of the observed antitumor effect. These
findings have specific implications on improving the properties of WT-PEDF, which is currently in preclinical
development, and encourage the development of PEDF mutants as specific, neovascularization-targeting anticancer agents. Cancer Res; 70(15); 6247–57. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Neovascularization is a well-recognized target for anticancer therapy. Numerous angiogenesis-targeted anticancer
agents have already been approved, while others are in clinical trials nowadays (1). As such, the pigment epitheliumderived factor (PEDF) was first isolated from the conditioned
medium of primary human retinal pigment epithelial cells,
where it was shown to act as a neurotrophic and antiangiogenic factor (2). In particular, PEDF plays a key role in the
reduction of abnormal neovascularization in the eye, and
its natural antiangiogenic activity is far greater than that of
any other known endogenously produced factor (3, 4).

Recently, it has become evident that PEDF is widely expressed throughout the human body and is persistent in systemic circulation (5, 6), thereby suggesting its possible
involvement in angiogenesis-associated processes, including
development and growth of solid tumors. Indeed, downregulation of PEDF mRNA and/or protein has been detected in a
wide range of human malignancies (7–11). PEDF expression
was shown to be inversely correlated with cancer progression
(7), intratumoral microvessel density (MVD; refs. 11, 12), metastatic potential (12, 13), and less favorable prognosis (11,
12). In addition, it has been shown that PEDF-overexpressing
cancer cells exhibit reduced growth rate in vivo (14, 15) and
that PEDF therapy results in a profound inhibition of tumor
growth in animal cancer models (8, 16–19). Yet, the exact
molecular mechanism by which PEDF causes tumor suppression is not completely understood, and it has been proposed
that PEDF may possess both indirect and direct antitumor
effects (6). Indirectly, reduction in tumor growth is achieved
through the antiangiogenic action of PEDF, in which the selective targeting of newly formed vasculature without harming the existing blood vessels is of a particular importance
(20). This effect was suggested to involve inhibition of activity
and/or expression of vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF; refs. 6, 21), as well as the proapoptotic activity of

PEDF toward immature and migrating endothelial cells (6,
21, 22). Although still controversial, it has been reported that
PEDF also exerts a direct antitumor effect, possibly by inducing either antiproliferative or prodifferentiation activities toward cancer cells (15, 21).
In a previous study, our group showed that plasma PEDF
is a phosphoprotein that is phosphorylated by casein kinase
2 (CK2) on Ser24 and Ser114 and by protein kinase A (PKA)
on Ser227, and that variable phosphorylation states of PEDF
differentially regulate its physiologic function (23, 24). Using
several phosphorylation site mutants that mimic either the
phosphorylated (Ser to Glu) or nonphosphorylated (Ser to
Ala) forms of PEDF, we showed that triply phosphorylated
PEDF serves as a much stronger antiangiogenic factor than
its wild-type (WT) form while retaining basal neurotrophic
activity. On the other hand, the doubly CK2-phosphorylated
PEDF also exhibits higher antiangiogenic activity than
WT-PEDF, but has no detectable neurotrophic activity.
Thus, we hypothesized that phosphomimetic mutants of
PEDF, namely EEA-PEDF (S24E114E227A) and EEE-PEDF
(S24E114E227E; schematically represented in Fig. 1), may
serve as more efficient neovascularization-targeting agents
than WT-PEDF and thus may have a stronger inhibitory effect on the growth of primary tumor, either with or without a
neurotrophic activity.
Indeed, we report here that PEDF mutants inhibit tumor
growth better than WT-PEDF, where EEE-PEDF exhibits superior antitumor activity, which is comparable with that of
the established antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab (Avastin).
The enhanced antitumor effect of PEDF mutants is associated with more profound reduction in MVD and increased ability to induce apoptosis of endothelial cells that build the
tumor vasculature, acting in a VEGF-independent manner.
In addition, we show that PEDF and more so its mutants efficiently induce apoptosis of cultured endothelial cells but do
not affect the survival of cancer cells, suggesting that the
antitumor effect of these agents is indirect and is achieved
mainly through their antiangiogenic activity.

Cell culture
All cancer cell lines used in this study were purchased from
the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) during the last
10 years. Cells were expanded by culturing them for less than
two passages and stored frozen in liquid nitrogen according to
explicit ATCC guidelines. Thawed low-passage cells were used
for experiments within the period of 4 months. U87-MG were
cultured in 4.5 g/L D-glucose DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, antibiotics, and 10% fetal calf
serum (FCS). HCT116 and MDA-MB-231 were grown in
McCoy's 5A medium (Sigma) and RPMI medium (Invitrogen),
respectively, with the same supplements plus 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate. Endothelial cells [human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and bovine aortic endothelial cells
(BAEC)] were a gift of Prof. I. Vlodavsky (Cancer and Vascular
Biology Research Center, Technion, Haifa, Israel) and were
previously described and authenticated (25, 26). For the experiments, HUVEC and BAEC were used between passages 3
to 7. BAEC were cultured in 4.5 g/L D-glucose DMEM supplemented with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, antibiotics, and 10% FCS.
HUVEC were cultured on gelatin-coated plates in M199 medium (Sigma) with the same supplements, 0.1 mg/mL heparin,
and 0.025 mg/mL ECGS (BT-203, Biomedical Technologies).
All cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere
of 95% air and 5% CO2.

phosphomimetic Glu.

Animal studies
All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care
and Use Committee of the Weizmann Institute of Science
(Rehovot, Israel). Female CD-1 nude mice (Harlan), 6 to
8 weeks of age, were inoculated s.c. in the flank region with
3 × 106 MDA-MB-231, 3 × 106 U87-MG, or 2 × 106 HCT116
cells in 100 μL PBS. Tumors were allowed to develop to
the size of ∼100 mm3 and then animals were randomly allocated to different treatment groups. Recombinant PEDF constructs and bevacizumab were administered by i.v. injection
into the tail vein. Tumor dimensions were measured with a
digital sliding caliper and, thereafter, tumor volume was calculated from the major dimension (L) and minor dimension
(S) using the following equation: tumor volume (V) = L × (S)2/
2. To assess any signs of systemic toxicity, body weight was
monitored three times per week. At the end point, weight of
selected organs was recorded and vascularization was examined immunohistochemically using anti-CD31 antibody, as
described below.

PEDF Mutants as Potent Anticancer Agents

PEDF production
WT-PEDF, EEE-PEDF, and EEA-PEDF were cloned from
pBlueScript/PEDF, pCDNA3/EEE, and pCDNA3/EEA (23, 24),
respectively, into pRSET(A) (Invitrogen), and expressed in
E. coli BL21. Bacterial cells were grown at 30°C to OD600 nm =
0.5 to 0.6, and the expression of recombinant proteins was
induced by 0.5 mmol/L isopropyl-L-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 4 to 5 hours. Pelleted bacterial cells were lysed,
and purification of recombinant proteins was performed using ion metal affinity chromatography with Ni-NTA His-Bind
resin (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Elution fractions were resolved on SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining or Western blotting with anti-PEDF antibody developed by the Antibody Unit of the Weizmann Institute of
Science. The identity of recombinant WT-PEDF and its mutants was verified by mass spectroscopy. Eluates that exhibited >90% purity were dialyzed against PBS.
Immunohistochemistry
Excised tumors were fixed in either formalin or zinc buffer,
embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. Deparaffinized and rehydrated tumor sections were subjected to antigen retrieval
by microwave treatment in 10 mmol/L sodium citrate (pH
6.0; formalin-fixed tissues only). Sections were blocked with
2% normal horse serum and either underwent terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) assay (as described below) or were immunostained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Jackson Immunoresearch), anti-CD31, or antiCD34 antibodies followed by incubation with corresponding
secondary antibodies. MVD in the most intensive neovascularization areas (“hotspots”) was assessed according to previously established methods (27). Individual microvessels were
counted at ×10 field using DeltaVision OMX fluorescent microscope station supplied with a digital camera (Applied
Precision). Quantification of the apoptotic rate in tumors
was performed by calculating the percentage of apoptotic
(TUNEL-positive) cells out of total number of either CD34positive or CD34-negative cells in a field. Pictures were
taken, deconvolved, and processed using SoftWorx software
(Applied Precision).
Immunoblotting
Cells were grown to subconfluency and then serum starved
(0.1% FCS) for 16 hours. After incubation with indicated
treatments, cells were lysed in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer and extracts were obtained by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4°C. Tissue homogenates from
freshly harvested tumors were prepared using pestle homogenizer in RIPA buffer (2 mL/g tissue) followed by centrifugation. Aliquots of cellular extracts or tissue homogenates were
subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the
corresponding primary antibody, followed by incubation
with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody
(Jackson), and developed using EZ-ECL kit (Biological Industries) in Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS imaging station. Each experiment was performed three times to test for reproducibility
and obtain statistically significant data. Quantification of the

www.aacrjournals.org

band intensities was performed using QuantityOne software
(Bio-Rad).
Reverse transcriptase-PCR
Total tissue mRNA was isolated using the RNA extraction
kit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of
total RNA using SuperScript (Invitrogen). The subsequent
PCR reaction used specific human or mouse VEGF-A primers. PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels and
stained with ethidium bromide. Levels of VEGF-A mRNA expression were assessed by comparing band density using
QuantityOne software (Bio-Rad). Amplification of the product representing GAPDH was used to check the efficiency
of the PCR reaction. GAPDH PCR profiles were compared
and equalized. To test for reproducibility, duplicate amplifications were performed for each sample.
Cell survival assay
Cell survival was assessed over 48 hours using methylene
blue assay. Following treatments, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed once in 0.1 mol/L sodium borate buffer (pH 8.5), and thereafter incubated with 1% methylene blue
for 10 minutes. Excess stain was washed out with double distilled water. Stain was extracted with 0.1 mol/L HCl, and
OD595 was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay reader.
Apoptosis assay
Apoptosis was evaluated using TUNEL kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer's protocol. DeltaVision OMX fluorescent microscope station supplied with a digital camera and
SoftWorx software (Applied Precision) was used to process
the slides.
Statistical analysis
In vitro data were expressed as mean ± SD, whereas in vivo
data were expressed as mean ± SEM. To test for differences
between the control and experimental results, statistical
evaluation was carried out using either functional analysis
(ANOVA) followed by Student's t test (two-tailed) or log-rank
test (Mantel-Cox; for detailed description, see Supplementary Data). Values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.

Results
Triple phosphomimetic PEDF exhibits enhanced
antitumor activity in vivo
To compare the antitumor activity of WT-PEDF to that of
its phosphomimetic mutants, EEA-PEDF and EEE-PEDF, we
first used a xenograft model of human invasive breast carcinoma (MDA-MB-231), implanted s.c. into CD-1 nude mice. Upon
establishment of visible tumors, mice were treated i.v. with
WT-PEDF, EEA-PEDF, or EEE-PEDF at three different dosage
regimens along with a bevacizumab-treated positive control
group. In mock-treated (PBS) controls, progressive tumor
growth occurred over a treatment period of 3 weeks, whereas
significant and dose-dependent decrease in tumor growth was

phosphomimetic mutants were administered at three different dosage regimens as indicated. In the HCT116 and U87-MG models, all PEDF constructs were

observed in all other experimental groups (Fig. 2A and B).
When administered at 1 mg/kg body weight, EEE-PEDF
caused profound attenuation in tumor growth already after
2 weeks of treatment, reducing the tumor volume by 85% compared with mock-treated animals (Fig. 2A). This effect was
much stronger than that of WT-PEDF (52%), EEA-PEDF
(56%), or bevacizumab (61%). At the end point, the antitumor
effect of EEE-PEDF at all tested dosages significantly prevailed
over that of WT-PEDF (Fig. 2B). The maximal final reduction
of tumor volume achieved with EEE-PEDF was 76% compared
with 57% with WT-PEDF, 61% with EEA-PEDF, and 70% with
bevacizumab. Similar results were obtained in two additional

xenograft models, HCT116 (human colorectal carcinoma) and
U87-MG (human glioblastoma). In both of these models, the
antitumor effect of EEE-PEDF significantly exceeded that of
WT-PEDF (Fig. 2C and D). To further compare the efficacies
of treatments used, we performed statistical evaluation of tumor growth data using log-rank test, with tumor volume quadrupling time as time-to-end point (TTE), which thereby
reflects relative delay in tumor growth. Data analysis showed
that all treatments resulted in significantly prolonged TTE
compared with PBS-treated controls (Supplementary Table
S1). Importantly, TTE values following EEE-PEDF administration were significantly longer (1.27–1.33-fold, depending on

the model) than those observed in WT-PEDF–treated groups.
Overall, these data indicate that EEE-PEDF possesses improved antitumor properties compared with WT-PEDF, and
its anticancer effect is comparable with that of bevacizumab.
It should be noted that PEDF constructs were administered three times per week at dosages of up to 1 mg/kg body
weight, whereas bevacizumab was injected at 5 mg/kg body
weight five times per week. Toxicity studies indicated that
phosphomimetic PEDF lacks any detectable systemically
harmful effects even when injected at 5 mg/kg body weight
(Supplementary Fig. S1A and B), and does not affect vascularization of major organs (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Following i.v. injection, phosphomimetic PEDF is retained within
the vascular compartment (Supplementary Fig. S2A) and exhibits considerable stability in murine plasma over 48 to 72
hours (Supplementary Fig. S2B). These observations indicate
a possibility of additional dose escalation, which may produce a further enhanced antitumor effect.
Triple phosphomimetic PEDF inhibits tumor
angiogenesis more efficiently than WT-PEDF
Because PEDF was reported to exert its anticancer effect
mainly through inhibition of intratumoral neovascularization (6, 21, 22), we determined whether the antitumor activity of EEE-PEDF and EEA-PEDF correlates with their ability
to disrupt establishment of tumor vascular network. For
this purpose, MDA-MB-231 xenografts, excised at the end
of the experiment, were sectioned and analyzed immunohistochemically using antibody to CD34, a well-known
marker for newly formed blood vessels. In these studies,
xenografts from the treated mice exhibited much lower
vascular density than PBS-treated controls, where EEEPEDF showed the most pronounced effect (Fig. 3A and
B), leading to 87% reduction in MVD, compared with 54%,
66%, and 81% in WT-PEDF–, EEA-PEDF–, and bevacizumabtreated groups, respectively. A corresponding trend of reduction in MVD was observed in HCT116 and U87-MG
xenografts (Fig. 3A and B).
PEDF constructs act in a VEGF-independent manner
A number of reports have suggested that the antiangiogenic
effect of PEDF arises, at least in a part, from a decline in VEGF
expression (21, 28). To address this point, we examined
xenograft tissues of the treated animals for the expression of
VEGF-A and the phosphorylation of VEGFR2, a major signal
transducing receptor for VEGF-A. Under our experimental
conditions, none of the treatments caused significant fluctuations in the mRNA levels of either human VEGF-A, expressed
by the MDA-MB-231 tumor cells, or mouse VEGF-A, expressed
by the host-derived tumor milieu (Fig. 4A and B). Correspondingly, VEGFR2 phosphorylation was not affected by the PEDF
constructs, whereas bevacizumab, being a humanized VEGFA monoclonal antibody (29), almost completely inhibited
VEGFR2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4C and D). Because bevacizumab does not neutralize mouse VEGF, this indicates that tumor VEGFR2 was activated mainly by human VEGF secreted
by xenograft cells, rather than by mouse VEGF produced by
the host. Thus, it is more likely that the anticancer effect

www.aacrjournals.org

achieved by bevacizumab in our experiments reflects its maximal activity. These findings, reproduced also in HCT116 and
U87-MG xenografts (Fig. 4A–D), clearly show that the antiangiogenic effect of PEDF and its mutants is achieved in a VEGFindependent manner in all tested models.
Triple phosphomimetic PEDF facilitates endothelial
cell apoptosis in vivo
Induction of endothelial and cancer cell apoptosis has
been implicated in the mechanism of antiangiogenic and
anticancer activity of PEDF (21, 22). Therefore, we evaluated
the rate of apoptosis in the treated MDA-MB-231 xenografts.
To discriminate between endothelial and tumor cell apoptosis, xenograft sections were costained with anti-CD34 and
TUNEL to identify apoptotic cells. We found that all treatments targeted predominantly endothelial cells of the newly
formed blood vessels, as the majority of TUNEL-positive cells
colocalized with CD34 staining (Fig. 5A). On the other hand,
other xenograft-residing tumor cells were affected to a much
lesser extent. Depending on the treatment, as much as 22%
to 60% of CD34-positive endothelial cells per field were identified as apoptotic, compared with only 4% to 14% of CD34negative cells, the latter representing mostly xenografted
cancer cells (Fig. 5B). Again, EEE-PEDF showed the highest
activity, leading to 60% apoptosis in CD34-positive endothelial cells and 14% apoptosis in CD34-negative tumor cells
compared with the respective 22% and 4% for WT-PEDF,
28% and 5% for EEA-PEDF, and 53% and 12% for bevacizumab (Fig. 5B). The low level of tumor cell apoptosis, which
was comparable with that caused by bevacizumab, is likely to
be derived from the lack of blood supply to nonvascularized
tumor areas and/or production of apoptotic cytokines by the
affected endothelial cells. Thus, the preferential induction of
apoptosis in endothelial cells further implies that the antiangiogenic effect of PEDF and its mutants is the foremost element of their antitumor activity.
PEDF constructs reduce survival and induce
apoptosis of endothelial cells but do not affect
cancer cells in vitro
We then studied the effects of WT-PEDF and its mutants
in cultured endothelial and cancer cells. First, we examined
whether WT-PEDF, EEA-PEDF, and EEE-PEDF affect survival
of BAEC and HUVEC, and found that nanomolar concentrations of PEDF constructs efficiently reduce endothelial cell
survival, with EEE-PEDF exhibiting a significantly stronger
effect than WT-PEDF (Fig. 6A). This effect was apparent even
in the presence of strong proangiogenic stimuli such as
VEGF and bFGF, where EEE-PEDF prevented stimulusdependent increase in BAEC proliferation much more efficiently than WT-PEDF (Fig. 6A). On the other hand, the same
concentration of the PEDF constructs did not affect survival
of cancer cells, including MDA-MB-231, HCT116, and U87MG (Fig. 6B). TUNEL assay revealed that WT-PEDF and more
so its mutants induce apoptosis of BAEC, but not of MDAMB-231 cells (Fig. 6C). These results were supported by the
ability of PEDF and its mutants to activate caspase-3, known
to be involved in PEDF-induced endothelial cell apoptosis, as

manifested by the appearance of 17- and 19-kDa cleavage
products in BAEC (Fig. 6D). Also in this case, the accumulation of caspase-3 cleavage products following treatment with
PEDF mutants was faster than with WT-PEDF. In contrast to
BAEC, PEDF constructs failed to induce caspase-3 cleavage
in cultured MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 6D), suggesting again
that the inhibitory effect of PEDF constructs on tumor
growth is mostly indirect.

Discussion
PEDF is a well-established antiangiogenic agent, with an
increasing number of reports showing that it can be used
as an anticancer drug (6, 8, 16–19). Our group has previously
shown that physiologic activities of PEDF are differentially
regulated by phosphorylation, and that triple phosphorylation site mutants mimicking different phosphorylation

states of PEDF (EEE-PEDF and EEA-PEDF) exhibit significantly elevated antiangiogenic activity compared with
WT-PEDF (23, 24). We therefore hypothesized that these
mutants can serve as much better angiogenesis-targeting
anticancer drugs than WT-PEDF, which is currently in preclinical development. Indeed, we found that EEE-PEDF,
but not EEA-PEDF, produces significantly better inhibition
of xenograft growth and intratumoral angiogenesis than
WT-PEDF in three different xenograft models, all of which
are known to develop major neovascularization (30, 31).
In these models, the extent of tumor growth inhibition

produced by EEE-PEDF was similar and sometimes slightly
better than that achieved by the well-known and potent
antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab, currently approved for
use in metastatic breast and colon cancer. Most importantly, our studies reveal superiority of the phosphomimetic PEDF over WT-PEDF in its ability to reduce the
survival and promote apoptosis of tumor endothelial cells,
and, because PEDF does not affect quiescent endothelial
cells of the existing vasculature (20), these properties represent an exceptionally effective mechanism for the inhibition of tumor growth.

In contrast to VEGF-targeting antiangiogenic agents,
which act by inhibiting VEGF signaling and thereby preventing recruitment of endothelial cells to form new blood vessels
(32), PEDF and more so its phosphomimetic mutants affect

distinct mechanisms of action suggest that PEDF mutants
can serve as drugs of choice when VEGF-targeting agents

PEDF Mutants as Potent Anticancer Agents

are not effective. The fact that PEDF and its mutants act in a
VEGF-independent manner points to a disparity of the mechanisms of action and provides a rationale for the combined
therapy with the PEDF mutants and VEGF-targeting drugs,
which is expected to produce an additive effect. Combined
therapy with other known chemotherapies should be taken
into consideration as well. Furthermore, the apparent lack
of systemic toxicity of PEDF and its mutants is an additional
important advantage of these agents as anticancer drugs.
Several studies have shown that PEDF successfully regresses tumor growth in animal cancer models (16–18), although a study by Doll and colleagues suggested that, in
some cases, PEDF administration does not produce significant tumor growth inhibition (10). Our preliminary experiments with other xenograft models have indicated that the
extent of tumor growth reduction following PEDF treatment
depends on angiogenic profile of a given model, suggesting

that PEDF affects mainly tumor-associated endothelium. Indeed, we showed that PEDF and its mutants preferentially
induce apoptosis in endothelial and much less in cancer cells
in vivo and do not affect cancer cell survival in vitro, while
efficiently inhibiting the growth rate of xenografts originating
from these cells. This is in agreement with another study that
showed similar effects of PEDF in HeLa cells, although the
effect of phosphomimetic mutants of PEDF was not examined there (33). These results suggest that the antiangiogenic
activity of PEDF, for example, its ability to affect actively proliferating and migrating endothelial cells, is the main component of its antitumor action.
The exact molecular mechanism of action of PEDF is not
fully elucidated yet. However, a number of studies in the past
decade have shown the involvement of different signaling
pathways in the biological activity of PEDF toward endothelial cells. It has been shown, for example, that PEDF-induced

apoptosis of endothelial cells can be mediated by the activation of the Fas-FasL system (22), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase–dependent cleavage of multiple caspases (34),
and by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ signaling to p53 (35). The main obstacle on the way to full delineation of the signaling pathways involved in the antitumor
activity of PEDF is the question of existence of a putative
PEDF receptor, which is still obscure. A few candidates have
been identified thus far, including extracellular matrix components (36, 37), a phospholipase-linked membrane protein
(38), and a laminin receptor (39). Thus, the observed enhanced activity of the phosphomimetic PEDF toward endothelial cells can have several explanations. The effects of the
PEDF mutants on endothelial cells can be regulated by the
same mechanism and/or receptor as WT-PEDF, and their enhanced activity could be explained by a stronger affinity to
receptor or a diverse time pattern of ligand-receptor interaction. Alternatively, PEDF mutants may affect the signaling
component of such receptor in a different manner. Finally,
PEDF mutants may exert stronger effects on downstream
signaling pathways. Evidence that PEDF exerts diverse effects
in endothelial, cancer, and neural cells (40, 41) may suggest
expression of different PEDF receptors with similar binding
characteristics and a distinct signaling component. As we
show here, PEDF and its mutants fail to induce apoptosis
in cancer cells, which may indicate the presence of a distinct,
less-specific receptor, rather than excluding the existence of
a PEDF receptor in these cells. Another possibility for the
lack of the proapoptotic effect of PEDF toward cancer cells
is that cancer cells could be more resistant to PEDF action by

virtue of the higher basal activity of their survival pathways.
However, additional studies are needed to further clarify
these points.
In summary, we show here that the antiangiogenic properties of PEDF can be considerably enhanced by mimicking
the triply phosphorylated form of this factor, resulting in a
significantly increased antitumor activity. Phosphomimetic
PEDF mutants operate through the mechanism that does
not involve VEGF inhibition, and therefore can be efficiently
used either as a single therapy or in combination with either
VEGF-targeting drugs, such as bevacizumab, or other chemotherapies. We believe that phosphomimetic mutants of
PEDF provide a basis for the development of new and extremely potent antiangiogenic anticancer drugs, which will
be superior to WT-PEDF and other antiangiogenic agents.
