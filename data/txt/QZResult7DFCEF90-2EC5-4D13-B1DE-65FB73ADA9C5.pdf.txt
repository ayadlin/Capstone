REVIEW

From identiﬁcation of the BTK kinase to effective
management of leukemia
CIE Smith
BTK is a cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase, whose corresponding gene was isolated in the early 1990s. BTK was initially identiﬁed
by positional cloning of the gene causing X-linked agammaglobulinemia and independently in a search for new kinases. Given the
phenotype of affected patients, namely lack of B-lymphocytes and plasma cells with the ensuing inability to mount humoral
immune responses, BTK inhibitors were anticipated to have beneﬁcial effects on antibody-mediated pathologies, such as
autoimmunity. In contrast to, for example, the SRC-family of cytoplasmic kinases, there was no obvious way in which structural
alterations would yield constitutively active forms of BTK, and such mutations were also not found in leukemias or lymphomas. In
2007, the ﬁrst efﬁcient inhibitor, ibrutinib, was reported and soon became approved both in the United States and in Europe
for the treatment of three B-cell malignancies, mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and Waldenström’s
macroglobulinemia. Over the past few years, additional inhibitors have been developed, with acalabrutinib being more selective,
and recently demonstrating fewer clinical adverse effects. The antitumor mechanism is also not related to mutations in BTK. Instead
tumor residency in lymphoid organs is inhibited, making these drugs highly versatile. BTK is one of the only 10 human kinases that
carry a cysteine in the adenosine triphosphate-binding cleft. As this allows for covalent, irreversible inhibitor binding, it provides
these compounds with a highly advantageous character. This quality may be crucial and bodes well for the future of BTK-modifying
medicines, which have been estimated to reach annual multi-billion dollar sales in the future.

INTRODUCTION
The development of the BTK inhibitors followed seminal studies
that initially were made already in the 1930s. During this period,
certain key discoveries paved the way for the subsequent
achievements. I will return to the more historical aspects at the
end of this review and begin with describing how studies of an
immunodeﬁciency disease resulted in the identiﬁcation of the
target for the newly developed inhibitors, namely the BTK kinase.
Owing to that the BTK gene carries more known mutations than
any other kinase-encoding gene, I will brieﬂy bring up some of the
corresponding implications. Next, I will provide a short update of
the BTK signaling pathway. Although numerous reports describe
the signal transduction of BTK in mice and men, the evolution
of this kinase dates back 4600 million years, with certain
evolutionary ramiﬁcations. The subsequent sections will describe
the development of the new BTK inhibitors, and their role in the
clinics, followed by a paragraph where the multifaceted role of
BTK for tumor development is discussed. The most recent clinical
advancements are also brieﬂy reviewed.
X-LINKED AGAMMAGLOBULINEMIA—THE MOST CLASSICAL
GENETIC IMMUNODEFICIENCY
In 1952, Ogden C Bruton, in a landmark paper, reported on an
immunodeﬁcient boy, highly prone to infections.1 Although
hereditary diseases accompanied by susceptibility to infections
were published already prior to Bruton’s classical description, the
uniqueness about this report was that it also identiﬁed an

underlying disease mechanism.1 Thus, as reviewed in greater
detail elsewhere,2,3 Bruton’s patient was analyzed using serum
electrophoresis, which at the time was a method only recently
introduced into the clinic. Bruton anticipated that the reduced
levels of gammaglobulin found in the patient might represent the
cause of the disease and obtained proof for this concept by
substituting the patient with gammaglobulin, which reduced the
propensity for bacterial infections, a hallmark of this disorder.
At the time, this treatment represented the latest in the
therapeutic arsenal, since manufacturing of gammaglobulin was
developed by Edwin J Cohn during World War II in order to treat
infected soldiers.4 Incidentally, Bruton used subcutaneous administration of the gammaglobulin, a route later abandoned for many
years but which has been revived during the past decades.5,6
Bruton’s report had a profound inﬂuence on the development of
the ﬁeld of primary immunodeﬁciencies with many new diseases
being characterized over the next few years.
However, it was not until two decades after the initial report
when it was demonstrated that lack of antibody-producing cells
causes the humoral phenotype7,8 in these patients. Among the
agammaglobulinemias, the X-linked form, XLA, represents the
most common disease9,10 and it is with this disorder that Bruton’s
name is associated. The disease is manifested at the stage when
pro-B cells develop into pre-B cells, with all the subsequent stages
essentially lacking,11 thereby causing an inability to mount
humoral immune responses. Patients are thus devoid of mature
B-lymphocytes as well as plasma cells, and lymphoid organs are
reduced in size.

DISEASE GENE CLONING AND THE ISOLATION OF THE BTK
GENE
In the 1980s, the hunt for new disease genes accelerated. This was
aided by the continuous addition of new chromosomal markers
enabling linkage analysis with increasing precision. At this time,
we were more interested in T-cell leukemias, and incidentally, the
identiﬁcation of an inversion of the long arm of chromosome 14,
inv(14)(q11 q32), as the most consistent chromosomal alteration
in T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL),12–15 currently
referred to as T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, set the stage for
the subsequent characterization of the TCL1 locus at 14q32.1 by
the groups of Carlo Croce and Giandomenico Russo.16 Serendipitously, the TCL1 open reading frame of 342 nt translates into a
protein of 14 kD, whose activity induces B-CLL in IgH-Eμ-TCL1transgenic mice17 and which has become a leading model for
experimental CLL. Interestingly, this form of CLL is sensitive to BTK
inhibitors and has also been used to identify components affected
by ibrutinib, such as impaired C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4
chemokine receptor surface expression18–20 as well as new
experimental therapies in the form of anti-SLAMF6 combined with
ibrutinib.21
In the 1980s, the nature of the gene causing XLA remained
elusive, although we suggested that it may encode an enzyme.22
Also other predictions were made as reviewed in Sideras and
Smith.3 The earliest studies demonstrated that XLA was not linked
to the Xg blood group,23 whose locus maps to the end of the short
arm of the X-chromosome. Following continued, reﬁned mapping,
as reviewed in Sideras and Smith,3 two groups, Guioli et al.24 and
Kwan et al.,25 identiﬁed the DXS178 marker, which subsequently
was used in the positional cloning strategy leading to the isolation
of the BTK gene.26 The principle was to use a yeast artiﬁcial
chromosome carrying the DXS178 marker to enrich cDNAs from
B-cell progenitors and subsequently employ these as probes in

Southern blotting of digested patient DNA in order to identify
potential mutations from altered restriction fragment lengths.
According to Dr Francis S Collins, director of the Human Genome
project, BTK became the seventeenth disease gene to be cloned
positionally (personal communication). In parallel, in the search for
novel kinases, the group of Owen Witte identiﬁed a new target
and, after mapping the corresponding gene to the X-chromosome, was able to link this discovery to XLA.27 The two reports
complemented each other, but owing to the two different names
that were used, a common name, BTK, was adopted and for the
ﬁrst time used in two back-to-back publications in the Science
journal describing the genetic origin of the mouse xid
mutation.28,29
The identiﬁed gene encodes a cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine
kinase of 659 amino acids with the following domain organization
from the N-terminus: Pleckstrin homology (PH), Tec homology,30,31
SRC homology 3 (SH3), SH2, and catalytic domain (SH1), as
reviewed in Smith et al.32 and Mohamed et al.33 Amino acid 481 in
the adenosine triphosphate-binding cleft of the kinase domain is a
cysteine residue (Figure 1). As described below, this residue is
crucial for the activity of the new BTK inhibitors, as it forms a
covalent bond with the majority of these medicines.
THE SPECTRUM OF MUTATIONS IN XLA
The ﬁrst two XLA mutations were reported already in the cloning
paper26 with patient A coming from a family in southern Sweden.
Both of these were missense mutations, thereby immediately
providing information about crucial residues. Two years after the
cloning, we established the international database for mutations
in the BTK gene, named BTKbase,34,35 and this online resource is
continuously being updated.36–38 Currently it contains a total
number of 1374 public variants representing 717 unique public

and β-strands are color-coded, as depicted. Residues buried (B), exposed (E) or being in an intermediate (I) position according to Valiaho
et al.38 are indicated below the amino-acid sequence. Boxed residues correspond to substitutions identiﬁed in ibrutinib- (IMBRUVICA) or
acalabrutinib-treated patients, with cysteine 481 to serine substitution being the predominant change.82,90–95

DNA variants. Figure 1 depicts all the known missense mutations
in the kinase domain, which is the region with the highest
variation density.39 The ﬁgure shows that the number of reported
replacements since the Lindvall report39 has increased from 107
(affecting 73 residues) to 164 (affecting 92 residues).
We recently described new substitutions and characterized all
possible single-nucleotide variation (SNAV) that caused aminoacid replacements in the kinase domain.38 Altogether 1495 singlenucleotide variations can appear and as many as 2/3 are predicted
to be harmful, while in only 10% of the sites all substitutions likely
would be tolerated. There is only a weak correlation among the 92
affected residues (Figure 1) to coils, β-strands and helixes,
with 33–44% of these sites affected. Instead, the relation to
accessibility is much stronger with 64% of buried and only 21% of
intermediate and 14% of the exposed sites being affected. It is
likely that catalytic domains in other kinases show a similar
dependency, with buried residues being the most sensitive to
replacements.
THE BTK SIGNALING PATHWAY
Sequencing of the BTK gene immediately revealed that the
corresponding protein was a previously unknown cytoplasmic
tyrosine kinase, and soon thereafter signaling from the B-cell
receptor (BCR) was implicated as part of the upstream pathway.
Takata and Kurosaki40 were the ﬁrst to demonstrate that
phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2) is a bona ﬁde substrate for BTK. The
current view is that SRC-family kinases, in particular LYN, activate
the non-catalytic BCR through the phosphorylation motifcontaining Igα and Igβ proteins. These subsequently serve as
docking stations for the SYK kinase, which phosphorylates the
adaptor BLNK/SLP-65 that interacts with BTK among other
molecules. LYN-mediated phosphorylation of tyrosine 551 in
BTK, a residue conserved among all cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine
kinases and corresponding to tyrosine 416 (in man)/419 (in the
mouse) in SRC, activates the kinase.41
Following the generation of cell membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) by phosphatidylinositol-3kinase, BTK translocates to the inner leaﬂet of the cell membrane.
The most N-terminal domain of BTK, the pleckstrin homology
domain speciﬁcally tethers to PIP342 and can also be used as a
highly efﬁcient probe for the detection of PIP3.43 Phosphorylation
of the PLCγ2 substrate subsequently generates inositol-3,4,5phosphate and also activates protein kinase C and calcium
signaling.44 A crucial further downstream component is nuclear
factor-κB, which is an important survival regulator for Blymphocytes.45–48
Inactivation of BTK signaling seems to be controlled by dual
serine/threonine phosphorylation in the kinase domain, which
attracts 14-3-3 proteins targeting phosphorylated BTK for
degradation.49 Also other serine phosphorylations seem to have
a negative effect,50,51 suggesting that serine/threonine phosphorylations turn off signaling of this tyrosine kinase. Expression of the
BTK gene is under the control of a promoter containing both
general and hematopoietic transcription factor-binding sites, as
published in this journal two decades ago.52 The above scenario is
similar in mice and humans, even if there are some species
differences. Thus, for reasons that are not known in detail,
deﬁciency of BTK causes a much more severe phenotype in
humans as compared with mice.28,29
In Drosophila melanogaster, the corresponding kinase is known
as Btk29A.53 Lack of Btk29A in ﬂies causes a lethal phenotype with
reduced size of the embryonic ring canals.54 Conversely, ﬂies with
an absent type 2-splice form are viable but with many organs
affected. Thus the nervous system is inﬂuenced by the deﬁciency,
with the lifespan being reduced by 85%. In transgenic ﬂies
carrying the human BTK cDNA under the control of a heat-shock
promoter, the phenotype can be reverted upon induction,55

demonstrating functional conservation during evolution. The BTK
kinase therefore seems to be highly adaptive, and during
development, it has been functionally rewired.56 Unexpectedly,
Btk29A acts a tumor suppressor during oocyte development, as
lack of the type 2-splice form causes germ cell tumors through
expansion of the cystoblast population.57 However, it is the
expression of Btk29A in the somatic escort cell, which controls the
cystoblast differentiation. Btk29A phosphorylates β-catenin (arm)
controlling piwi expression, which is needed for the silencing of
transposons in a Wnt-dependent signaling pathway. BTK expression seems to ﬁrst appear in the unicellular choanoﬂagellate,
suggesting that the ancestors of this kinase originated 4600
million years ago.58
THE DEVELOPMENT OF INHIBITORS
The ﬁrst inhibitor for BTK was LFM-A13 [alpha-cyano-beta-hydroxybeta-methyl-N-(2,5-dibromophenyl)propenamide], reported in 1999.59
Although this compound has been quite extensively studied, as
evidenced by 62 citations appearing in PubMed, it was never used in a
clinical setting. Instead, it was the compound initially referred to as
‘compound 4’,60 later known as PCI-32765, or ibrutinib (IMBRUVICA),
and depicted in Figure 2, which set the stage. In 2010 Honigsberg
et al.61 reported the beneﬁcial effects in both the treatment of
experimental leukemia and of autoimmunity. Thus it was found that
PCI-32765 induced objective clinical responses in dogs with
spontaneous B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Furthermore, in mice
with collagen-induced arthritis, orally administered PCI-32765 reduced
the level of circulating autoantibodies and completely suppressed
disease and, furthermore, also inhibited autoantibody production and
the development of kidney disease in a mouse lupus model.
Importantly, occupancy of the catalytic site in BTK by PCI-32765
tightly correlated with blockade of BCR signaling and with in vivo
efﬁcacy. This was soon followed by reports on patient leukemia cells,
which responded to the inhibitor in vitro as well as in the already
mentioned IgH-Eμ-TCL1-transgenic mouse model for B-CLL.18,62
Moreover, it was demonstrated that both adhesion and migration of
patient CLL cells were affected.63–65
The truly dramatic development began in 2013 following the
trial reported in J Clin Oncol.66 A total of 56 patients with relapsed
or refractory B-cell lymphoma or CLL received escalating oral
doses of ibrutinib. Adverse events were mainly grades 1 and 2 in
severity and self-limited. Consistent with the irreversible binding
to cysteine 481, BTK occupancy was maintained for at least 24 h.
The objective response rate was 60%, and complete response was
noted in 16% of the patients. Rapid approval from the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) followed: mantle cell lymphoma
(MCL), November 2013; CLL, July 2014; and Waldenström’s
macroglobulinemia (WM), January 2015; and the European
Medicines Agency has also approved the drug for the treatment of these B-cell malignancies.67 The stunning development
that ensued can be inferred from the number of citations
according to PubMed. Up until the report in J Clin Oncol in
2013,66 there were 28 citations for ‘ibrutinib’; as of 26 July 2016,
there are 629 citations, that is, a more than 20-fold increase over a
3-year period.
THE ROLE OF BTK IN TUMOR DEVELOPMENT
Based on the available literature, the role of BTK in tumor
development is complex. I would ﬁrst like to point out that
activating BTK variants have not been reported in patients. The
only BTK variations identiﬁed in cancer are those that occur after
treatment with BTK inhibitors (depicted in Figure 1) and discussed
in one of the following paragraphs. Experiments in mice, where
inactivating mutations for the genes encoding BTK or BLNK/
SLP-65 have been combined, clearly demonstrate that reduced
BCR signaling can cause lymphomas.68 However, as this

THE EFFECT ON MCL
Only months after the very ﬁrst clinical report on ibrutinib in 2013,
this drug was shown to induce durable, single-agent efﬁcacy in
relapsed or refractory MCL.73 A phase III study comparing ibrutinib
versus the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, temsirolimus,
in MCL, published in 2016, demonstrates that the BTK inhibitor
yields signiﬁcant improvement in progression-free survival and
better tolerability in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL.74
However, long-term treatment outcome in MCL is not very good,
despite unprecedented clinical activity, as primary and acquired
resistance to ibrutinib is common.75 Thus there is a need for more
efﬁcient BTK inhibitors or for better combination therapies. In an
open-label, phase II trial, it was shown that ibrutinib combined
with rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal, is active and well
tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL.76 The triple
combination of ibrutinib with the alkylating compound bendamustine and rituximab has also been investigated in studies,
including but not focusing on MCL.72 The overall response rate
in 12 MCL patients receiving ibrutinib together with bendamustine and rituximab was 94% with a complete remission in
76%, suggesting that combination therapies may be highly
beneﬁcial.77

necessitates the introduction of several alterations in the DNA, this
scenario is expected to be very rare in patients, and there are no
convincing clinical reports to date. Moreover, certain amino-acid
substitutions in BTK are oncogenic in transformation assays,33,69
but their clinical relevance remains elusive. Reports on oncogenic
forms of BTK outside the hematopoietic lineage also exist, but as
BTK is normally not expressed in these cells, further studies are
needed to conﬁrm this possibility. Yet another option is to use BTK
inhibitors to impair the activity of, for example, myeloid-derived
suppressor cells, which are known to promote many tumors.70
This concept has been tested experimentally71 and could
profoundly expand on the use of BTK inhibitors, if clinical
correlates exist.

THE CURRENT CLINICAL LANDSCAPE FOR BTK INHIBITORS
As mentioned, the ﬁrst clinical report on a BTK inhibitor was
published in January of 201366 and demonstrated a remarkable
effect of ibrutinib on B-cell malignancies. Since then, the potent
activity of this compound has been reported in several settings. I
will begin with reviewing MCL, the ﬁrst tumor for which ibrutinib
treatment was FDA approved, followed by CLL, for which the
largest number of treated patient exists, and end with a short
paragraph on WM. Studies are also ongoing in other B-lymphocyte
malignancies, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,72 but will not
be detailed here.

THE EFFECT ON CLL
Based on the excellent results in CLL from the ﬁrst clinical report
on ibrutinib,66 a large phase 1b-II trial followed, demonstrating
similar activity in the cohort receiving 420 mg per day as in the

one with the double dose.78 Several studies have shown a very
potent effect of ibrutinib in elderly CLL patients.79 Ibrutinib
treatment also yielded excellent results in patients with TP53
aberrations known to have dismal prognosis.80,81 Like for MCL, a
major interest is in combination therapies to be used when ﬁrstline treatments have failed. Among the ongoing combination
phase III studies, the HELIOS trial has recently demonstrated that
ibrutinib, when combined with bendamustine and rituximab as
compared with bendamustine and rituximab alone shows 80%
reduction in the risk of progression or death. Furthermore, the
phase III RESONATE-2 trial shows a signiﬁcant, 56% reduction for
the risk of death with ibrutinib compared with chlorambucil,
leading to the 2016 FDA approval of IMBRUVICA as ﬁrst-line
treatment for patients with CLL (http://www.janssen.com/fdaexpands-imbruvica-label-include-new-data-two-key-phase-3-trialsadding-overall-survival-and).
The recent addition of the second-generation BTK inhibitor,
acalabrutinib (Figure 2), has demonstrated that this compound
may have certain advantages given its higher speciﬁcity for
BTK.82 Thus the lack of inhibition of the related ITK kinase,
expressed in both T and natural killer cells, could be
of importance. Moreover, the absence of severe bleeds, thought
to be secondary to effects on the TEC kinase in platelets, and
the reported lack of atrial ﬁbrillation, possibly caused by an
effect on the receptor tyrosine kinases ErbB2/HER2/ErbB4/
HER4,67 could also be beneﬁcial. Importantly, the feared
transformation of CLL to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Richter
transformation), which is observed after ibrutinib treatment,
albeit rarely, was so far not found in patients treated with
acalabrutinib,82 although larger patient materials are needed in
order to draw any ﬁrm conclusions. Therefore, the results
from the ongoing phase III comparison between the two BTK
inhibitors are eagerly awaited.
Apart from combining BTK inhibitors with well-established
therapeutics, combinations could also be made with more
recently developed compounds, such as the second-generation
BCL2 inhibitor, venetoclax.83 Hence, it has been proposed that this
combinatorial therapy may be advantageous, because these
medicines rarely cause complete remission when used as single
agents.84
THE EFFECT ON WM
Ibrutinib treatment has demonstrated excellent effects in
WM, with an overall response rate of 90.5% in 63 patients.85
Unexpectedly, it was recently proposed that the effect of
ibrutinib on WM is not related to BTK but rather to an effect on
the SRC family kinase HCK.86 Although the authors provide some
support for this idea, it is not clear that a primary effect on
BTK was ruled out, and for this reason it will be interesting to
see how other BTK inhibitors with less activity on HCK fare in
WM patients.
OTHER INHIBITORS FOR BTK
Also other BTK inhibitors have been used in the clinic, such as
CC-292, formerly AVL-29287 and ONO/GS-4059. CC-292 is an
irreversible binder, whereas ONO/GS-4059 binds reversibly.
Limited information about their performance exists, but an overall
response rate of 53% was recently observed in 84 in patients with
CLL or SLL (small lymphocytic leukemia) receiving twice-daily
dosing of CC-292.88 For ONO/GS-4059, 24/25 evaluable CLL
patients (96%) responded, as did 11/12 patients with MCL
(92%).89

MUTATIONS CAUSING RESISTANCE TO BTK INHIBITORS
Resistance to BTK inhibitors can be caused by mutations. These
variants frequently either affect BTK itself or downstream signaling
components, preferentially BTK’s substrate PLCγ2. The most
common resistance variant is the replacement of cysteine 481
with a serine residue, which has been observed both after
ibrutinib and acalabrutinib treatment.82,90–94 Figure 1 depicts all
missense mutations observed in treated patients, including the
replacement of C481 with serine. For PLCγ2, a few gain-of-function
substitutions have been reported yielding a constitutively active
enzyme, which no longer needs to be phosphorylated by BTK.82,93
We have recently carried out mutation scanning for the BTK 481
codon and found that threonine substitution, which for genetic
reasons should be rare, behaves similar to serine substitution
causing resistance. We have also tried to explain the outcome of
all other single-nucleotide exchanges for this codon.95 Recently, it
was clearly demonstrated that resistance mutants exist prior to
ibrutinib treatment and, furthermore, that genetic changes
affecting non-BTK related components also might cause
unresponsiveness.96
BRIEF HISTORICAL OUTLOOK
The generation of the BTK inhibitors is a sign of how medical
evolution takes place in discrete steps (Figure 3). A crucial step
was the development of serum electrophoresis by Arne Tiselius in
Uppsala in 1937,97 for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize
in Chemistry in 1948 ‘for his research on electrophoresis
and adsorption analysis, especially for his discoveries concerning
the complex nature of the serum proteins’. Subsequently, Jan
Waldenström, also residing in Uppsala, employed serum
electrophoresis in his classical description of a tumor named
after him.98
Fifteen years after Tiselius’ original report, serum electrophoresis
was applied at the Walter Reed General Hospital in Washington
DC in the analysis of Bruton’s patient. Based on these results,
Bruton, also in a single-authored paper, provided evidence that
the missing factor in the patient was gammaglobulin,1 making
XLA the ﬁrst inherited immunodeﬁciency in which a disease
mechanism was revealed. Over the next four decades, the
development of molecular biology and genetics paved the way
for the positional cloning effort, which identiﬁed the disease gene

and detailed the ﬁrst mutations.26 In 1993, on my way to present
the BTK gene cloning at a Keystone conference in Taos, I,
unexpectedly, had the great honor of meeting with Dr Bruton
(Figure 4), as further detailed in Winkelstein and Smith.99 In 2007,
the initial description of ibrutinib appeared in print60 with the ﬁrst
paper on its beneﬁcial clinical effects published 6 years later. In
2015, 78 years after Tiselius’ landmark paper, this compound was
reported to be highly efﬁcient as treatment for patients with WM,
thereby closing the circle (Figure 3). To this end, I could also
mention that Professor Waldenström in the 1970s was one of my
teachers in internal medicine at the Seraﬁmer Hospital, another
ingredient in the ‘full circle’.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
The development of the BTK inhibitors demonstrates how basic
research laid the foundation for clinical development in ways
that cannot be predicted. Thus, while the possible use of such
inhibitors for the treatment of neoplasms existed as one
of many options, there was no direct evidence that this
approach would be successful. Instead, as it turned out, BTK
does not seem to be directly involved in tumor development
but for certain leukemias and lymphomas is essential for the
thriving of the malignant cells. Although BTK inhibitors have
Oncogene (2017) 2045 – 2053

been said to revolutionize treatment, we are in an era of rapid
development in the therapeutic arena. Numerous compounds
are being investigated, both alone and in combinations. It is not
possible to make any insightful predictions of compounds that
will show the best proﬁle in terms of efﬁcacy and adverse
effects, but certainly BTK inhibitors have demonstrated a good
balance. The rare existence of a cysteine residue in the catalytic
site, which is a signature of BTK and other members of
this family of kinases, is deﬁnitely a major asset, as it enhances
the ‘effective speciﬁcity’ by the irreversible binding to only
those targets.
With the second generation of BTK inhibitors showing increased
speciﬁcity, as well as permitting higher dosing, signiﬁcant
improvements have already been accomplished. This has also
resulted in industrial acquisitions with AstraZeneca in February

Although this review is focused on oncology, BTK inhibitors are
certainly of great interest also for other disorders caused by B cells,
including autoimmunity where resistance variants are not
expected to occur. Thus the future for BTK inhibitors seems
bright, but only the test of time will reveal whether these
medicines will remain in the therapeutic arsenal for years
to come.
