BACKGROUND. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is responsible for an increasing
number of infections, especially in hospitalized patients. Therapy options are
limited and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is often the main
treatment option for this infection. In the current study, the risk factors were
determined for the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. maltophilia.

METHODS. A case-control study was conducted to determine risk factors for the
development of MDR S. maltophilia in cancer patients. The case group was
composed of patients treated at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center for MDR S. maltophilia between 1996 and 2004 (n ¼ 54). Two control
groups were used: patients at comparable risk for S. maltophilia (C-controls) and
patients with S. maltophilia infection that was susceptible to TMP-SMX and at
least 2 other antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, amikacin, and ticarcillin/
clavulanate) (S-controls).

RESULTS. When compared with C-controls, prior use of carbapenems or quinolones and admission to an intensive care unit within 30 days of isolation of the
pathogen were found to be independently associated with MDR S. maltophilia
infection (P < .02), as was an increased overall mortality rate (P ¼ .04). When
compared with S-controls, risk factors were history of S. maltophilia infection
during the prior year and prior use of TMP-SMX (P ¼ .015).

CONCLUSIONS. Judicious use of TMP-SMX, carbapenems, and quinolones is
necessary to control the risk for MDR S. maltophilia infection. Cancer

S

tenotrophomonas maltophilia has emerged, with increasing incidence, as an important opportunistic nosocomial pathogen in
patients with cancer and other critical conditions.1–3 It is most often
associated with pneumonia, but it may also cause a wide spectrum
of diseases.3,4 Several studies from the University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston have shown that S. maltophilia
infections were associated with a severe clinical course and high
mortality rates.5–7 This increase in incidence of this infection may
be a consequence of selective pressure caused by the overuse of
broad-spectrum b-lactam antibiotics.8–10
A prominent feature of S. maltophilia is its resistance to multiple antibiotics, including b-lactam agents such as the carbapenems,
cephalosporins, and aminoglycosides.11 Treating S. maltophilia infections is a challenge because of the organism’s resistance to most
antimicrobial agents and the variable antimicrobial susceptibility of
different strains of the organism.12–15

The antimicrobial agent most frequently active
against S. maltophilia is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX).4,5,16,17 However, several studies
have reported resistance to TMP-SMX.1,13,17–21 A
previous surveillance study22 found that the rates of
resistance to TMP-SMX ranged from 2% in Canada
and Latin America to 10% in Europe, with rates ranging from 3% to 19% during the study period.
Another agent, ticarcillin/clavulanate, has been found
to be active in 60% to 70% of cases. Quinolones,
aminoglycosides, and ceftazidime are also used, but
are less active.17
We sought to identify risk factors associated with
acquiring infections caused by multidrug-resistant
(MDR) S. maltophilia through a case-control study of
patients with cancer who had had MDR S. maltophilia infections, as well as examine mortality associated
with the infection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We identified retrospectively all patients who had
S. maltophilia infections between January 1996 and
September 2004 at the University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center through searching the
microbiology laboratory and the Infection Control
Surveillance records. We performed 2 simultaneous
case-control analyses after the Institutional Review
Board approved the study.

Cases and Controls
We used the criteria established by the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention to determine the
cases for the study.23 Patients with colonization were
excluded from the study. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was considered MDR if it was resistant to
TMP/SMX and to at least 2 other additional antibiotics that are often active against S. maltophilia:
ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, amikacin, or ticarcillin/
clavulanate. We used 2 control groups with the ratio
of cases to controls as 1:2 for each of the 2 control
groups. The control groups were selected from
patients who had been in the same place at the
same time as the other cases. The first control group
was a Comparable Risk Group (C-control) and consisted of 108 patients who were matched to the case
patients on the basis of their underlying cancer,
period of hospitalization, and duration of hospitalization; unlike the case patients, however, these patients
were not infected or colonized by S. maltophilia. The
other control group was a microbiologically susceptible group (S-control) and consisted of 108 patients
who were matched to the case patients based on
the site of infection. These patients had infections

caused by S. maltophilia, but the organisms were
susceptible to TMP-SMX and to at least 2 of the
four antibiotics often active against S. maltophilia:
ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, amikacin, and ticarcillin/
clavulanate. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing to
determine MDR was performed according to National
Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System guidelines
and with the E-test for antimicrobial susceptibility.

Data Collected and Risk Factors Investigated
Data were collected from patient charts as well as
computerized pharmacy, Infection Control, and
microbiology databases. Information was collected
regarding age; sex; cancer diagnosis; comorbid conditions; and history of surgery, radiation therapy, and
chemotherapy. The following were considered comorbid conditions or risk factors if they had occurred
within 30 days before the isolation of S. maltophilia:
prior hospitalization before admission for the infection, a stay in an intensive care unit (ICU), neutropenia and its duration, severity of illness based on the
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II
(APACHE II) classification system, and history of
steroid therapy. For the cases and control group S,
data were collected on antibiotics given within the
90 days before the date of isolation of S. maltophilia;
for control group C, data were collected on antibiotics given within the 90 days before the matched
hospitalization date, including any days during the
current hospitalization before the case patient’s
culture became positive.
Data were also collected on all patients to evaluate treatment success or failure and overall mortality
rates. Treatment failure was defined as a clinical or
microbiologic lack of response or recurrence of the
infection or death of the patient resulting from the
S. maltophilia infection.
Statistical Analyses
Cases were compared with each of the 2 controls
using the chi-square test or the Fisher exact test to
assess the univariate association of categoric risk
factors for acquiring MDR S. maltophilia. Those
categoric risk factors were sex, underlying disease,
chemotherapy, steroid use, and neutropenia within
30 days of isolation of S. maltophilia, and antibiotic
use within 90 days of its isolation.
We used the Shapiro-Wilks test to determine the
normality of the continuous risk factors, which were
age at admission, APACHE II score, and duration of
neutropenia. The 2-sample Student t-test or Wilcoxon
rank sum test was used to compare the measures
between case and control patients. If the distribution
of a continuous variable departed significantly from

normality we repeated the comparison using the
nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
Logistic regression models were used for further
analyses. First, for factors that had a P-value < .10
on the 2-sample Student t- or Wilcoxon rank sum
test, we performed a univariate analysis for each
factor alone. We then performed multiple logistic
models: initially, a full multiple logistic regression
analysis, and then a backward selection method to
determine the final (reduced) multiple model so that
all factors remaining in the model were statistically
significant at a 5% level (P < .05). Data analyses
were performed using SAS software (version 9.1; SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Patient Groups
We identified a total of 54 patients who had had
infections caused by MDR S. maltophilia during
the study period (case patients) and we included 108
control patients in each of the 2 control groups
(C-control and S-control).

Univariate Analyses
By univariate analysis, when cases were compared
with C-control (patients with comparable risk factors
but with no infection), the following factors were
found to be significantly associated with acquiring
MDR S. maltophilia infection: the use of any
antibiotics within 90 days before the date of the
S. maltophilia culture (85.2% vs 68.5%, respectively,
for case and control patients; P ¼ .023), specifically
carbapenems (46.3% vs 25.0%; P ¼ .006) and quinolones (66.7% vs 43.5%; P ¼ .006). Another risk factor
identified was ICU stay within 30 days before the
date of the culture (29.6% vs 8.3%; P ¼ .0004). The
overall mortality rate was also significantly associated
with the MDR infection (23.1% vs 10.9%; P ¼ .046)
(Table 1).
When cases were compared with S-control
(patients whose S. maltophilia infections were susceptible to antibiotics), the following risk factors
were found to be significantly associated with
acquiring MDR S. maltophilia infection: prior ICU
stay (29.6% vs 13.0% for cases and controls, respectively; P ¼ .01), history of S. maltophilia infection

TMP-SMX use during the prior 90 days (35.2% vs
20.4%; P ¼ .041). However, S-control patients were
more likely than the cases to have undergone chemotherapy during the month before the infection
(50.0% vs 33.3%; P ¼ .044), to have had a prior hospitalization during the month before the infection
(45.4% vs 20.4%; P ¼ .002), and tended to have been
treated less often with cephalosporins within the 90
days before the infection (25.9% vs 35.2%; P ¼ .07).
The overall mortality rate was comparable between
the cases and the S-control patients (22.2% vs
17.3%; P ¼ .45), and response to treatment was also

comparable between these 2 groups (64% vs 76.0%;
P ¼ .12) (Table 2).

Multiple Logistic Regression Analyses
Using C-control (Table 3) the following variables
were found to be independently associated with
MDR S. maltophilia infection: prior treatment with
carbapenems within 90 days before the date of
culture (odds ratio [OR] of 4.70; 95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 1.63–13.50 [P ¼ .004]), prior use of
quinolones within 90 days before the date of culture
(OR of 3.19; 95% CI, 1.25–8.14 [P ¼ .015]), and an

Prior hospitalization within 30 days before the
current admission was less likely to be associated
with MDR S. maltophilia infection (OR of 0.20; 95%
CI, 0.06–0.64 [P ¼ .007]). In the multiple logistic
regression analysis using S-control (Table 4) the
following variables were found to be independently
associated with MDR S. maltophilia infection: history
of infection with S. maltophilia within the previous

prior treatment with TMP-SMX within 90 days before

hospitalization were less likely to be associated with

antibiotic use as a risk factor. For example, in a
review of case-control studies that analyzed the risk
factors for infections resistant to antibiotics, Harris
et al.24 noted that biased estimates might result if
patients with antibiotic-susceptible microorganisms
were used as controls. And in a study of risk factors
for nosocomial infections caused by antibioticresistant bacteria, Paterson25 noted that the optimal
control group would be hospitalized patients with
the same potential exposure to the antibiotic-resistant bacteria that the case patients had. Thus, not
only would the control patients be hospitalized
during the same period as the case patients, but they
would also be hospitalized for at least the same
duration as the case patient: from the time of admission of the case patient to the first isolation of the
resistant organism in question.25
S. maltophilia isolates are intrinsically resistant
to many commonly used antimicrobial agents. They
produce diverse drug-hydrolyzing enzymes such
as L1, a zinc-dependent metalloenzyme, and L2, a
cephalosporinase, which are able to destroy important b-lactam antibiotics such as carbapenems and
cephalosporins.19,26,27 S. maltophilia isolates also
quickly develop resistance to fluoroquinolones by
mutations in outer-membrane proteins. Recently,
Zhang et al.28 demonstrated the involvement of efflux
mechanisms in acquired MDR in S. maltophilia.
The use of carbapenems has also been established as a risk factor for S. maltophilia infection. In
a previous case-control study conducted at the
University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center,29

DISCUSSION
In this study, we found that a number of risk factors
are associated with the acquisition of MDR S. maltophilia infections, including the prior use of TMPSMX, carbapenems, and quinolones, as well as prior
ICU stay and prior infection with S. maltophilia.
The unique aspect of our study was that we used
2 control groups: 1 consisting of patients who had
susceptible S. maltophilia infections and the other
consisting of patients who were at high risk for the
infection but who did not have it. We used these 2
control groups because there has been some concern
that the conventional method for selecting control
patients in case-control analyses is not sufficient,
and might lead to an overestimate the impact of

the case patients infected by S. maltophilia had been
treated with imipenem 10 times more frequently
than the uninfected control patients. In the current
study, when MDR S. maltophilia cases were compared with control patients who were at a comparable risk, it is possible that the use of carbapenems and
quinolones contributed to the emergence of S. maltophilia at our hospital. In a more recent study also conducted at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center, Ohmagari et al.30 demonstrated that
treatment with carbapenems for more than 7 days was
associated with the emergence of MDR Pseudomonas
aeruginosa.
A number of studies have pointed to an association between ICU stays and the subsequent development of infections with MDR organisms. In 2
studies17,31 ICU stay was found to play a role in
increased incidence, morbidity, and mortality due to
S. maltophilia. One was a prospective, multicenter
observational study by Muder et al.,17 with 91 cases
of bacteremia due to S. maltophilia; the other was a
study by Wang et al.31 assessing the characteristics
of 50 episodes of S. maltophilia bacteremia in 48
patients. In the current study, an ICU stay within
30 days before the isolation of S. maltophilia was
found to be significantly associated with the emergence of MDR S. maltophilia and had the highest
OR of all the risk factors. The reasons behind this
emergence were likely the use of multiple antibiotics,
the presence of multiple comorbid conditions, and
the impaired immunity.
Our study also pointed to the role of quinolones
in causing the increased incidence of S. maltophilia
infections. Quinolones are among the most commonly used antibiotics for this infection. In a previous case-control study, Spanik et al.32 found that the
prophylactic use of quinolones in patients with
cancer had a role in causing bacteremia due to MDR
gram-negative bacilli in neutropenic cancer patients,
including S. maltophilia.
The use of TMP-SMX has been identified as a
potential risk factor for the emergence of TMP-SMXresistant S. maltophilia. Vartivarian et al.13 observed
that the overall usage of antibiotics, therapeutically
and particularly prophylactically, in patients with
cancer affected the overall susceptibility patterns of
S. maltophilia isolates and that the same isolates
became more susceptible to TMP-SMX when the
usage of that antibiotic decreased in the hospital.
The rates of resistance to TMP-SMX increased when
it was used for selective decontamination of the
bowel, but those rates decreased when ciprofloxacin
was substituted; however, the rates of resistance to
ciprofloxacin increased with its use.13

Conversely, however, we have to point out that
in our study TMP-SMX was identified as a risk factor
of MDR S. maltophilia infection only from the
comparison that chose patients infected with susceptible S. maltophilia as the control group (S-control),
not from the comparison of case-patients vs patients
with comparable risk for the infection but without it
(C-control). Therefore, it should be noted that
the effect measure of TMP-SMX in our study is
somewhat biased.24
Ohmagari et al.30 found that a history of a
P. aeruginosa infection during the preceding year was
independently associated with the emergence of
MDR P. aeruginosa infections. In addition, a case series by Harris et al.33 showed that MDR P. aeruginosa
emerged in a stepwise manner after a patient’s exposure to antipseudomonal antibiotics and caused
adverse outcomes.33 We believe that in our study a
similar mechanism likely accounted for the increased
incidence of MDR S. maltophilia infections in patients infected with the TMP-SMX-susceptible strain
the preceding year.
In the current study, prior cephalosporin use was
less likely associated with MDR S. maltophilia infection. This could be explained by the other findings of
the study. According to multivariate analysis, cases of
MDR S. maltophilia infections were more likely
to have experienced a prior S. maltophilia infection
during the preceding year and were more likely to
have received prior TMP/SMX, which may be attributed to less use of cephalosporins in this group. Prior
hospitalization was also found to be less likely
associated with MDR S. maltophilia infections. The
reason for its ‘protective’ effect in our study remains
to be investigated.
In the current study, the most common source of
isolation of S. maltophilia was the respiratory system, a finding noted in other studies as well, including the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program.22
In that study, pneumonia-causing S. maltophilia
isolates were 4 times more prevalent than bloodstream infection isolates of S. maltophilia. The isolation rates by geographic area per year in patients
with pneumonia varied from 1.2% to 4.8%.22 Other
studies34,35 have observed that S. maltophilia pneumonia can be complicated by bacteremia, septic
shock, and multiple-organ-dysfunction syndrome.
Outcomes for patients with S. maltophilia infections are also associated with various risk factors. In
a study of 99 cases, Morrison et al.36 observed a
greater likelihood of death in patients in whom the
isolates were polymicrobial (50%) than in patients
with pure S. maltophilia isolates (30%). Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is often part of a polymicrobial

Resistant S. maltophilia/Ansari et al.

infection,16 and in fact 46% of the S. maltophilia
infections in our study were polymicrobial. In the
patients infected with MDR S. maltophilia the overall
mortality rate was significantly higher than that in
the patients in control group C. In a multivariate
analysis study by Vartivarian et al.37 it was shown
that the presence of severe shock at onset of infection and delay in appropriate therapy were significant predictors of poor outcome. In what to our
knowledge is 1 of the few studies that evaluated
morbidity and mortality rates in patients with TMPSMX-resistant S. maltophilia infections, Tsiodras
et al.38 reported a crude mortality rate of 20% in the
patients with a microbiologically confirmed infection, a rate similar to that seen in our study. According to Muder et al.17 survival rates tend to be higher
in patients with S. maltophilia infections who are
treated with more than 1 active agent than in those
treated with single agents. The use of combination
therapy with colistin, rifampin, and aztreonam has
been found efficacious.39,40
Our study had several limitations. First, it is retrospective in nature. Second, here have been changes
in antimicrobials in the formulary or changes in the
infection control practice and procedures over the
8 years. Third, our study lacks a comparison of
patients infected with susceptible MDR S. maltophilia (S-control) vs uninfected control patients
(C-control) that would be helpful for us to have a
better knowledge about the risk factors of MDR
S. maltophilia infection.
In conclusion, the current study investigated the
risk factors associated with the acquisition of MDR
S. maltophilia infections in patients with cancer,
which is a patient population that is highly likely to
be exposed to prophylactic antibiotics, such as quinolones and TMP/SMX, and empiric antibiotics, such
as carbapenems and quinolones. We identified the
use of carbapenems, quinolones, TMP/SMZ, prior
ICU stay, and history of prior infection with S. maltophilia as risk factors. Judicious prophylactic and
empiric use of quinolones, TMP/SMX, and carbapenems is necessary, especially in this high-risk cancer
patient population.
