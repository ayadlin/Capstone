ABSTRACT
We have recently shown that hydrophobic weak base anticancer drugs are highly
sequestered in acidic lysosomes, inducing TFEB-mediated lysosomal biogenesis and
markedly increased lysosome numbers per cell. This enhanced lysosomal sequestration
of chemotherapeutics, away from their intracellular targets, provoked cancer multidrug
resistance. However, little is known regarding the fate of lysosome-sequestered
drugs. While we suggested that sequestered drugs might be expelled from cancer
cells via lysosomal exocytosis, no actual drug-induced lysosomal exocytosis was
demonstrated. By following the subcellular localization of lysosomes during exposure
to lysosomotropic chemotherapeutics, we herein demonstrate that lysosomal drug
accumulation results in translocation of lysosomes from the perinuclear zone towards
the plasma membrane via movement on microtubule tracks. Furthermore, following
translocation to the plasma membrane in drug-treated cells, lysosomes fused with
the plasma membrane and released their cargo to the extracellular milieu, as also
evidenced by increased levels of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D in the extracellular
milieu. These findings suggest that lysosomal exocytosis of chemotherapeutic drugloaded lysosomes is a crucial component of lysosome-mediated cancer multidrug
resistance. We further argue that drug-induced lysosomal exocytosis bears important
implications on tumor progression, as several lysosomal enzymes were found to play
a key role in tumor cell invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis.

INTRODUCTION

target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) on serine 211,
mediating its retention in the cytoplasm in an inactive
state, via binding of phosphorylated TFEB to 14-3-3
proteins [6]. Whereas, activation of TFEB is mediated by
release of Ca2+ from the lysosome through mucolipin 1
(MCOLN1), bringing about the activation of the Ca2+dependent serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin,
resulting in dephosphorylation of TFEB by calcineurin.
As unphosphorylated TFEB cannot bind 14-3-3 proteins,
it is translocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus
[7]. Nuclear TFEB activates genes of the coordinated
lysosomal expression and regulation (CLEAR) network,
responsible for the biogenesis of new lysosomes [8].
Hydrophobic weak base anticancer drugs are known
to accumulate at very high levels in lysosomes via cation
trapping; these hydrophobic drugs move freely across
phospholipid membranes, including the plasma membrane

Lysosomes are acidic intracellular organelles found
in all eukaryotic cells, excluding erythrocytes. Lysosomes
contain an assortment of hydrolases with optimal catalytic
activity at acidic pH; these enzymes breakdown various
macromolecules and damaged organelles, arriving at the
lysosome both from extracellular milieu, via endocytosis
and phagocytosis, as well as from the intracellular
compartment also via autophagy [1]. Apart from their
role as the major recycling center of the cell, lysosomes
are known to partake in a variety of cellular processes
including nutrient sensing [1–3], plasma membrane
repair [4] and apoptosis [5]. Lysosomal biogenesis is
tightly regulated by the master transcriptional regulator

EB, TFEB); TFEB is phosphorylated by mammalian

and the lysosomal membrane. Once these drugs encounter
the acidic pH of the lysosomal lumen, they become
protonated, due to their weak base nature, and thus are
no longer able to traverse the lysosomal membrane and
become entrapped within the lysosome [9–12]. We have
recently demonstrated that lysosomal accumulation
of chemotherapeutics mediates drug resistance by
sequestering these anticancer drugs in the lysosomes, away
from their cellular target sites [11, 13, 14]. We have further
shown that the number of drug-accumulating lysosomes
per cell is directly correlated with the extent of cellular
resistance to the cytotoxic effect of these drugs [14]. We
have further reported that lysosomal accumulation of
hydrophobic weak base drugs triggers the translocation of
TFEB from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, resulting in
the transcription of genes from the CLEAR network, and a
significant increase in lysosome number per cell [14]. We
have thus proposed a model for drug-induced lysosomemediated drug resistance, in which accumulation of drugs
within lysosomes triggers TFEB-mediated lysosomal
biogenesis, increasing the number of lysosomes per cell,
thus enabling an enhanced lysosomal sequestration of
hydrophobic weak base anticancer drugs [14].
Lysosomal exocytosis is a Ca2+-dependent process
in which lysosomes fuse with the plasma membrane,
and release their cargo into the extracellular milieu
[1, 15]. In the first step of lysosomal exocytosis, which
is Ca2+-independent, lysosomes are recruited to a region
proximal to the plasma membrane via association with,
and movement on microtubules; in the second step
which is Ca2+-dependent, lysosomes fuse with the plasma
membrane, resulting in the release of the lysosomal
content into the extracellular compartment [1, 15–18].
Lysosomal exocytosis was found to partake in various
physiological processes, including plasma membrane
repair [4], large particle endocytosis by macrophages
[19], degradation and regeneration of nerve cells [20].
Intriguingly, just like lysosomal biogenesis, lysosomal
exocytosis was recently found to be regulated by TFEB;
overexpression of TFEB was found to both increase
the number of lysosomes near the plasma membrane
and induce fusion of these lysosomes with the plasma
membrane, which is mediated by Ca2+ release from the
lysosome [17]. It was recently suggested that lysosomal
exocytosis might partake in the clearance of anticancer
drugs sequestered in lysosomes, thus possibly contributing
to drug resistance in cancer cells, but thus far little was
known regarding the correlation between lysosomal drug
accumulation and lysosomal exocytosis [10, 21]. In this
regard, it is noteworthy that lysosomal exocytosis was
shown to be triggered in mouse macrophages by lysosomal
alkalinization via treatment with H+-ionophores, lysosomal
accumulation of weak amines or inhibition of the vacuolartype H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), which is physiologically
responsible for the acidification of lysosomes [22]. Given
the fact that lysosomal accumulation of hydrophobic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

weak base chemotherapeutics also results in lysosomal
alkalinization [23], it seems likely that it might also induce
lysosomal exocytosis.
In addition to a possible role in drug excretion and
resistance, lysosomal exocytosis is also likely to play
a major role in tumor invasion, metastasis and hence
progression [24, 25]; Overexpression and secretion of
several lysosomal enzymes including cathepsins B, D,
K, and L was found to influence various characteristics
of tumor progression, including tumor growth, invasion
and angiogenesis [25, 26]. On the other hand, leakage of
lysosomal hydrolases including cathepsin D, from the
lysosome into the cytosol was found to induce apoptosis
or non-apoptotic lysosomal cell death [27], suggesting that
exocytosis of damaged lysosomes might also contribute to
protection of the cell from release of lysosomal enzymes
into the cytoplasm and subsequent cell death.
We undertook the current study to determine
whether or not exposure of cancer cells to hydrophobic
weak base chemotherapeutics, known to markedly
accumulate in lysosomes, alters the intracellular
distribution of lysosomes, and induces fusion of lysosomes
with the plasma membrane. We further sought to study the
impact of lysosomal accumulation of anticancer drugs on
the secretion of lysosomal enzymes into the extracellular
milieu via lysosomal exocytosis.

RESULTS
Lysosomal accumulation of anticancer drugs
leads to translocation of lysosomes from the
perinuclear zone towards the plasma membrane
It is well established that the majority of mature
lysosomes reside in the peri-nuclear zone [28]. Thus,
the first step in the process of lysosomal exocytosis is
the directional translocation of lysosomes from this
peri-nuclear zone towards a location adjacent to the
plasma membrane. To determine the possible impact of
hydrophobic weak base chemotherapeutics, which are
known to highly accumulate in lysosomes (Table 1), on
lysosomal localization, as well as translocation of drugaccumulated lysosomes towards the plasma membrane,
HeLa cells were stably transfected with lysosomalassociated membrane protein 1 tagged with the fluorescent
protein mCherry (LAMP-1-mCherry). These LAMP1mCherry stably expressing HeLa cells were exposed to
a single dose of the topoisomerase I inhibitor topotecan
(10 µM) or the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor
sunitinib (10 µM), both of which are hydrophobic
weak base anticancer drugs (Log P = 0.8, calculated
pKa = 9.83 as well as log P = 5.2 and pKa = 8.95,
respectively; derived from DrugBank [29]), and were
previously shown to markedly accumulate in lysosomes
[13, 14, 30]. Cells were also exposed to a single dose of
siramesine (10 µM), a sigma-2 receptor ligand, which was

shown to induce lysosomal membrane permeabilization
(LMP) leading to cell death; hence, siramesine was
suggested as a novel anticancer compound that targets
lysosomes in cancer cells [31, 32].  Upon exposure of
cancer cells to these lysosomotropic drugs, subcellular
localization of lysosomes was followed by time-lapse
confocal microscopy (Figure 1A). Lysosomes were
initially localized to the perinuclear zone in all cells
analyzed. Control cancer cells which were not exposed
to any drug treatment, retained this original perinuclear
lysosomal localization throughout the time-course of the
experiment. In contrast, cancer cells exposed to the above
lysosomotropic anticancer drugs, as well as cancer cells
exposed to siramesine, displayed lysosomal translocation
towards the plasma membrane, and formation of lysosome
foci near the plasma membrane, as early as 30–90 min
after initial drug exposure. It is noteworthy that formation
of lysosomal foci near the plasma membrane in cells
treated with siramesine was more rapid compared to
cells treated with topotecan or sunitinib, suggesting that
siramesine has a stronger and more immediate effect on
lysosome integrity. Indeed, siramesine was previously
shown to highly accumulate in lysosomes, and rapidly
induce LMP [32]. These findings are in agreement with
our results demonstrating that siramesine is the most
potent and rapid compound to trigger translocation of
lysosomes to the plasma membrane. We hence undertook
a quantification of lysosome foci formation near the
plasma membrane following 2 hr of exposure to the
above drugs, as well as to the topoisomerase II inhibitor
doxorubicin (10 µM); it should be noted that the latter is
also a hydrophobic weak base (log P = 1.27, calculated
pKa = 8.94), and was also found to accumulate in
lysosomes [33]. This quantification revealed a significant
increase in the formation of lysosome foci near the plasma
membrane after treatment with these lysosomotropic drugs
(Figure 1B).

with microtubules was found in the periphery of these
cells. In contrast, in cells treated with siramesine or
topotecan, there was a significant accumulation of
lysosomes near the plasma membrane, in agreement with
the results described above. In this regard, it is noteworthy
that this finding suggests that drug-induced lysosomal
translocation is independent of LAMP1 overexpression,
which was used in the time-lapse microscopy but not
in this experiment. In addition to the translocation of
lysosomes towards the plasma membrane in drug-treated
cancer cells, we also detected a marked association
of lysosomes with microtubules in the extensions
leading towards lysosome foci forming near the plasma
membrane. These results suggest that drug-induced
lysosomal movement towards the plasma membrane
is mediated by microtubules. We thus postulated that
disruption of microtubule polymerization may abolish
this lysosomal translocation. To test this hypothesis, HeLa
cells stably transfected with LAMP1-mCherry, were
treated with siramesine (10 µM) for 1hr with or without
a 3 hr pre-treatment with the microtubule-disrupting
agent, nocodazole (1 µM). While control cells which
were not exposed to nocodazole formed lysosome foci
near the plasma membrane, as described in the previous
chapter, disruption of microtubules in cells treated with
nocodazole resulted in the retention of lysosomes in
the perinuclear zone of cells treated with siramesine
(Figure 3). This result demonstrates that intact
microtubules are required for drug-induced translocation
of lysosomes towards the plasma membrane.

Accumulation of anticancer drugs in lysosomes
leads to fusion of lysosomes with the plasma
membrane
Following microtubule-mediated recruitment of
lysosomes to the plasma membrane, the second obligatory
step of lysosomal exocytosis is the fusion of the lysosomal
membrane with the plasma membrane, resulting in the
release of the lysosomal cargo into the extracellular
compartment [1]. We next aimed to determine whether
or not accumulation of anticancer drugs in lysosomes
results in the fusion of lysosomes with the plasma
membrane; HeLa cells were transiently transfected with
lysosomal pHluorin (Lyso-pHluorin). Lyso-pHluorin is a
fusion protein between the lysosomal membrane protein
CD63 and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) analogue,
pHluorin [36]. Similar to GFP, pHluorin has green
fluorescence at neutral pH, however under the acidic pH
conditions residing in the lysosomal lumen, pHluorin
fluorescence is quenched [37]. In Lyso-pHluorin, the
pHluorin is facing the lysosomal lumen, and as long as
the lysosome remains acidic no pHluorin fluorescence
is detected (Figure 4A–4C). In contrast, upon exposure
of Lyso-pHluorin-stained HeLa cells to the vesicular H+ATPase (V-ATPase) inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (1 µM, 2 hr),

Lysosomes associate with microtubules and
undergo translocation towards the plasma
membrane upon exposure to lysosomotropic
drugs
Long range intracellular movement of lysosomes
as well as lysosomal exocytosis, were both shown to
depend on microtubules [34, 35]. Having demonstrated
drug-induced lysosomal translocation from a peri-nuclear
location towards the plasma membrane, we further aimed
to determine whether or not this lysosomal translocation is
based on association with microtubules. Towards this end,
HeLa cells were pulse-treated with siramesine (10 μM)
or topotecan (10 μM) for 1 hr, followed by cell fixation
and immunofluorescence staining with LAMP1- and
α-tubulin-specific antibodies (Figure 2). Expectedly, in
untreated cells, the majority of lysosomes were found to
reside near the nucleus, and no association of lysosomes

an established lysosome alkalinizing agent, pHluorin
fluorescence was detected in the lysosomes, due to the
unquenching of pHluorin in the neutralized lysosomal
pH (Figure 4D–4F). Little Lyso-pHluorin fluorescence
was found on the plasma membrane of bafilomycin A1treated cells, suggesting that lysosomal alkalinization
is not sufficient to induce lysosomal exocytosis. In
contrast, Lyso-pHluorin-stained HeLa cells treated with
siramesine (10 µM, 2 hr) (Figure 4G–4I) or topotecan
(10 µM, 2 hr) (Figure 4J–4L) displayed Lyso-pHluorin
fluorescence in both lysosomes, and on the plasma

membrane. The alkalinization of lysosomes by these
lysosomotropic drugs can be explained either by the
accumulation of a high concentration of the weak base
drugs in the lysosomal lumen [23], or by LMP, a known
effect of siramesine [5], resulting in the disruption of
the pH gradient between the lysosome and the cytosol.
The gain of Lyso-pHluorin fluorescence at the plasma
membrane indicates that siramesine and topotecan
induced fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane.
Specifically, this fusion of lysosomes with the plasma
membrane causes the pHluorin to face the extracellular

milieu, resulting in the unquenching of pHluorin. As a
control of a non-lysosomotropic drug, Lyso-pHluorinstained HeLa cells were treated with the dihydrofolate
reductase (DHFR) inhibitor methotrexate (10 µM, 2 hr),
a hydrophilic antifolate anticancer drug which does
not accumulate in lysosomes. Expectedly, no pHluorin
fluorescence was detected in lysosomes nor on the plasma
membrane (Figure 4M–4O), indicating that the reported
lysosomal alkalinization and fusion with the plasma
membrane is mediated by the lysosomal sequestration
of hydrophobic weak base chemotherapeutics but not by
hydrophilic drugs which do not accumulate in lysosomes.

cathepsin D (cath-D) in the extracellular medium was
determined by Western blot analysis (Figure 5). Cath-D
is initially synthetized on ribosomes in the rough
endoplasmic reticulum (RER) as a pre-pro-enzyme,
which is then processed in the ER to a 52 kDa pro-cath-D,
which is targeted to the lysosome. In the lysosome several
additional proteolytic processing steps result in the
formation of a 48 kDa intermediate of cath-D, which is
further processed to form the 31–34 kDa heavy chain and
a 14 kDa light chain of mature cath-D [38, 39]. While the
amount of 52 kDa pro-cath-D secreted from the cells did
not vary significantly following drug treatment, there was
a significant increase in the secretion of the 31 kDa and
the 34 kDa mature heavy chain species of cath-D after
treatment with all three lysosomotropic drugs (Figure 5).
This result indicates that while drug treatment did not
affect secretion of the unprocessed pro-cath-D directly
from the trans-Golgi, it did induce release of the mature
cath-D found exclusively in lysosomes, suggesting that
drug-induced secretion of lysosomal enzymes is mediated
by lysosomal exocytosis, and not by failure to target
lysosomal enzymes from the Golgi to the lysosome.

Drug-induced lysosomal exocytosis results in the
secretion of the lysosomal protease cathepsin D
Fusion of the lysosome membrane with the plasma
membrane culminates in the release of the lysosomal
content into the extracellular milieu. To address this
lysosomal exocytosis, HeLa cells were exposed to

anticancer drugs results in an enhanced secretion of the
lysosome content, including lysosomal enzymes, into the

the plasma membrane (Figure 6B). This resulted in the
formation of lysosome foci in the periphery of the cell,
followed by fusion of the lysosome membrane with the
plasma membrane and consequent release of the lysosomal
cargo to the extracellular milieu (Figure 6B). Thus, the
present study constitutes the first evidence of anticancer
drug-induced lysosomal exocytosis.
We therefore propose a summary model (Figure 6)
which is based upon our present findings as well as on
those obtained by other research groups, in order to
illustrate the putative sequence of molecular events
occurring upon exposure of cancer cells to lysosomotropic
cytotoxic agents, culminating in lysosomal biogenesis,

DISCUSSION
Herein we have demonstrated that exposure of
cancer cells to hydrophobic weak base chemotherapeutics
which highly accumulate in lysosomes via cation-trapping,
results in a rapid onset of lysosomal exocytosis, which
is initiated by microtubule-mediated translocation of
lysosomes from the perinuclear zone (Figure 6A) towards

microtubule-dependent translocation of perinuclear
lysosomes to the plasma membrane, lysosome-plasma
membrane fusion and finally exocytosis. As previously
shown, weakly basic hydrophobic anticancer drugs
represented by doxorubicin, mitoxantrone and topotecan
are first intercalated into the external hemilayer of the
plasma membrane and presumably undergo a relatively

rapid flip-flop to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane
[40]. Upon internalization, they may also undergo
rapid incorporation into the external leaflet of the
lysosome membrane followed by flip-flop into the inner
membrane leaflet (Figure 6A). This intercalation into
the hydrocarbon lipid core of the lysosomal membrane
occurs via the insertion of the multi-aromatic ring

Figure 6: A summary model for drug-induced lysosomal exocytosis. In the absence of lysosomal stress, lysosomes are located

near the nucleus. Hydrophobic weak base chemotherapeutics accumulate in the lysosomal membrane, due to protonation of basic residues
facing the acidic lumen of lysosomes and retention of hydrophobic residues in the lipid bilayer (A). Accumulation of high concentration
of drugs in the lysosomal membrane induces lysosomal membrane fluidization and permeabilization, resulting in the release of Ca2+ ions
from the lysosome into the cytoplasm. Release of Ca2+ activates calcineurin which dephosphorylates TFEB, resulting in its translocation
into the nucleus and activation of the CLEAR pathway. Consequently, lysosomes associate with microtubules and are translocated towards
the plasma membrane. Lysosomes fuse with the plasma membrane and release their content, including sequestered drugs and lysosomal
enzymes, into the extracellular milieu (B).

structure of these anticancer drugs, for example via the
planar hydrophobic anthracene structure of doxorubicin
and mitoxantrone. Hence, once the amino residue of the
daunoseamine group of these anthracyclines (Table 1)
faces the highly acidic lumen of the lysosome (pH = 5.2),
it rapidly undergoes protonation rendering them cationic
compounds (Figure 6A). Consequently, these cationic
anticancer drugs are entrapped in lysosomes and are no
longer able to diffuse out across the lysosomal membrane.
This results in their accumulation at very high levels in
the lysosomal membrane. As we have previously shown,
these high levels of amphiphilic molecules in biological
membranes result in a marked alteration in membrane
fluidity (i.e. membrane fluidization) [41] provoking LMP
due to a detergent-like effect on the lysosomal membrane.
Consequently, this LMP is also accompanied by leakage
of Ca2+ ions from the lysosome into the cytosol via
mucolipin 1, which presumably assumes an open Ca2+
channel configuration. This efflux of Ca2+ ions, activates
dormant calcineurin which resides in the cytoplasm
(Figure 6B). The latter which is now endowed with a
Serine/Threonine phosphatase activity, dephosphorylates
TFEB at residue 211 [17], resulting in translocation of
TFEB to the nucleus. Nuclear TFEB orchestrates the
transactivation of the CLEAR pathway, hence inducing
lysosomal biogenesis and exocytosis. However, it should
be noted that at least another group of lysosomotropic
compounds was found to target lysosomes and result in
LMP and/or lysosomal cancer cell death via mechanisms
distinct from those described above [31, 42]; this group
of compounds is represented by siramesine. In one mode
of action, siramesine was found to exhibit high-affinity
binding to phosphatidic acid and to acidic phospholipids
[42]. Thus, upon entrapment in lysosomes, lysosomotropic
compounds appear to inflict various deleterious effects to
the membrane of the lysosomes, provoking lysosomal
biogenesis and exocytosis.
The first implication of our finding of drug-induced
lysosomal exocytosis is the release of the anticancer drug
cargo that highly accumulated in lysosomes. Thus, this
constitutes a novel mechanism of multidrug resistance
based on drug sequestration and efflux in addition to any
co-existing multidrug efflux transporter activity [12]. We
have previously shown that lysosomal sequestration of
anticancer drugs is a mechanism of resistance of cancer
cells to hydrophobic weak base anticancer drugs [10, 14].
This novel mode of resistance is based on lysosomal
sequestration of chemotherapeutic drugs in lysosomes,
hence preventing them from reaching their intracellular
target sites, abolishing their cytotoxic activity [10, 14].
While accumulation of anticancer drugs within lysosomes,
occurs predominantly via ion-trapping, active transport
of certain drugs into lysosomes was also described
[10, 43]; however, little was known regarding the fate
of the sequestered drugs or the drug-loaded lysosomes.
Our current findings demonstrate that drugs sequestered
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in lysosomes do not remain entrapped within these
lysosomes indefinitely, and are extruded from the cell via
lysosomal exocytosis. We thus postulate that lysosomemediated drug resistance is a two-step process: in the
first step, drugs are sequestered in lysosomes away from
their intracellular target sites, and in the second step they
are extruded out of the cell via lysosomal exocytosis.
Both lysosomal biogenesis and exocytosis, which we
have previously shown to be induced by lysosomal
accumulation of anticancer drugs [14], are mediated by
the release of Ca2+ ions from the lysosome, resulting in
the activation of calcineurin, a Ca2+-dependent serine/
threonine phosphatase, with consequent dephosphorylation
of TFEB and its translocation to the nucleus [7, 17]. As
some lysosomotropic drugs were shown to induce LMP,
leading to lysosome-mediated cell death [5], we postulate
that Ca2+ release from drug-permeabilized lysosomes,
and subsequent lysosomal exocytosis, might also serve
as a cellular defense mechanism against the cytotoxic
release of the lysosomal content into the cell. Thus, these
findings suggest that drug-induced lysosomal exocytosis
provides a two-tier defense mechanism, both by extrusion
of cytotoxic drugs from the cell as well as by preventing
LMP-mediated cell death.
The fact that drug-induced activation of TFEB
promotes not only lysosomal biogenesis, as previously
described [8], but also lysosomal exocytosis, is in
agreement with a recent study demonstrating that nuclear
localization of TFEB is indeed required for transcriptional
activation of lysosomal exocytosis [17]. We thus propose
that drug-induced lysosomal biogenesis and lysosomal
exocytosis must go hand in hand, in order to maintain the
cellular lysosomal capacity needed to sustain the required
level of lysosomal activity for cell survival; while lysosomal
exocytosis reduces the number of lysosomes per cell due
to the fusion of drug-loaded lysosomes with the plasma
membrane, lysosomal biogenesis is activated to replace
these lysosomes with newly synthetized lysosomes that
have not yet accumulated hydrophobic weak base drugs.
As demonstrated herein, drug-induced lysosomal
exocytosis results in the secretion of lysosomal enzymes
into the extracellular milieu. In this respect, it is important
to note that several lysosomal enzymes including cathepsin
B, D, K and L, were found to partake in various malignant
processes, both within, but also outside the cell, including
invasion, metastasis and activation of angiogenesis
[25, 26]. Cath-D, which was shown herein to be highly
secreted from cancer cells via drug-induced lysosomal
exocytosis, was previously found to be overexpressed in
breast cancer cell lines and in most breast cancers [27].
Furthermore, in clinical studies which examined cath-D
levels in primary breast cancer tumors, high levels of
cath-D were shown to be a poor prognostic marker, as
they correlated with enhanced metastasis and shorter
survival [27, 44]. Cath-D was also found to be highly
secreted from breast and colorectal cancer cells, where it
45127

contributed to both the invasive and metastatic potential
of these cells [45]. While thus far cath-D was mainly
found to be secreted from cancer cells in its catalytically
inactive pro-enzyme, 52 kDa form, it was suggested that
it can be activated in the acidic microenvironment of the
tumor [46]. Intriguingly, it was recently demonstrated
that some of the contribution of cath-D to the malignant
progression is not dependent on its catalytic activity, as
the cath-D mutantD231N, which is proteolytically inactive,
retained mitogenic activity in cancer cells [47].  One other
lysosomal enzyme relevant to tumor progression, among
the multiple hydrolytic enzymes present in lysosomes, is
the unique enzyme heparanase; it should be noted that
the final stage in the activation of heparanase occurs in
the lysosome via proteolytic cleavage of a linker region
encompassing Ser110–Gln157 mediated by cathepsin L [48],
hence liberating an N-terminal 8-kDa subunit as well as a
C-terminal 50-kDa subunit, which remain associated as a
noncovalent heterodimer in the mature active heparanase
[49]. Thus, heparanase, is an endoglucuronidase which
cleaves heparan sulfate (HS), resulting in alteration of the
structure and function of heparan sulfate proteoglycans
(HSPG) as well as tumor-dependent remodeling of both
cell surface and the extracellular matrix (ECM) [50–54].
These important activities markedly impact multiple
regulatory pathways, predominantly via acceleration
of cell invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis also by
enhancement of the bioavailability of growth factors and
cytokines bound to HS [50, 53]. Heparanase, present
in lysosomes and late endosomes, plays an essential
housekeeping role in catabolic processing of internalized
HSPGs [55], autophagy [56] and exosome formation
[57]. Importantly, heparanase can be trafficked to the
cell surface or released into the ECM, where it affects
breakdown of extracellular pools of HS [58]. Specifically,
heparanase-mediated hydrolysis of HS in the ECM has
several effects on the behavior of nearby cells. Weakening
of structural HS networks in the ECM directly facilitates
cell motility and invasion into surrounding tissues
[59]. Latent pools of growth factors entrapped within
HS are released upon breakdown by heparanase and
subsequently promote increased cell proliferation, motility
and angiogenesis [60, 61]. HS fragments generated by
heparanase activity can also activate downstream signaling
cascades [62]. Whereas controlled heparanase activity
plays an important role in physiological processing of
the ECM, tissue repair [63], hair follicle growth [64] and
immune surveillance, aberrant heparanase expression
is associated with inflammation and cancer, strongly
correlating with metastasis and dismal clinical prognosis
[51, 52, 54, 65].
In conclusion, exocytosis of lysosomes sequestering
anticancer drugs presents a major advantage in the crucial
adaptation to the harsh tumor microenvironment that
is both hypoxic, acidic, and nutrient-deprived. Thus,
angiogenesis, tumor cell invasion and tumor cell spread to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

distant sites for colonization in well-nourished and wellperfused healthy tissues, presents a key advantage for
malignant tumors which undertake the cellular decision
of lysosomal biogenesis and lysosomal exocytosis. In
this respect, novel targeting of lysosomal biogenesis
and exocytosis may achieve not only the overcoming
of chemoresistance but may also readily abolish tumor
invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis and acquisition of
an aggressive tumor phenotype. Therefore, our present
findings bear important implications for the possible
development of novel targeted cancer therapeutics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals
Siramesine,
topotecan,
4′,6′-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) and hoechst 33342 were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Sunitinib was
a kind gift from Prof. A.W. Griffioen, VU Medical Center,
Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Doxorubicin was from
Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, United Kingdom). Bafilomycin
A1 was purchased from Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale,
NY, USA).

Cell culture and transfections
Human cervical cancer HeLa cells were maintained
in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, Paisley, UK), supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 μg/ml
penicillin and streptomycin (Biological Industries, BethHaemek, Israel) in a humid atmosphere containing 5%
CO2 at 37°C. HeLa cells were transiently transfected using
Linear Polyethylenimine (PEI, MW 25,000) transfection
reagent (Polysciences, Pennsylvania, USA) at a ratio
of 3 µg PEI : 1 µg DNA. For stable transfection with
LAMP1-mCherry, 24 hr after transfection, cells were
subjected to G-418 selection (400 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) in the growth medium. pLAMP1mCherry was a gift from Amy Palmer (Addgene plasmid
# 45147). pCMV-lyso-pHluorin was a gift from Christian
Rosenmund (Addgene plasmid # 70113). pTurbo-RFP-C
was from Evrogen (Moscow, Russia).

Live cell imaging
HeLa cells were plated in 24-well glass bottom
plates (In Vitro Scientific, CA, USA). For lysosome
localization studies and pHluorin experiments, cells were
exposed to siramesine (10 µM), topotecan (10 µM), or
sunitinib (10 µM) for 2 hr. Fluorescence was followed
using an inverted confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 710).
For quantification of lysosomal plasma membrane foci,
cells were exposed to 10 µM siramesine, topotecan,
doxorubicin or sunitinib for 2 hr, followed by fluorescence
microscopy analysis using an InCell analyzer 2000 (GE
45128

Oncotarget

Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). To
achieve nuclear staining prior to fluorescence imaging,
cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 in
growth medium for 10 min. At least 200 cells from a
minimum of 40 images were analyzed for each treatment.
Lysosomal foci near the plasma membrane were identified
by an objective juxtaposition of the lysosomes to the
plasma membrane, hence being distant from the nucleus.

Immunofluorescence
HeLa cells were seeded in 24-well plates on sterile
glass coverslips and incubated for 24 hr at 37°C. Cells were
then treated with 10 μM siramesine or topotecan for 1 hr.
Cell fixation, permeabilization and immunofluorescent
staining were performed as previously described [14].
LAMP1 was visualized using rabbit anti-LAMP1
polyclonal antibody (ab24170; 1:1000 dilution, Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA). Microtubules were visualized using
anti-α-tubulin mouse monoclonal antibody T9026 (1:500
dilution, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Nuclei were
counterstained with the DNA dye DAPI (0.5 μg/ml).

Growth medium protein concentration and
Western blot analysis
For cathepsin D secretion experiments, HeLa cells
were plated in T75 flasks. Prior to the addition of drugs,
monolayer cells were washed with PBS to remove growth
medium proteins, the full medium described above was
replaced by a serum-free RPMI-1640 medium. Cells
were then treated with 10 µM siramesine, topotecan or
doxorubicin for 4 hr. The medium from each flask was
collected and passed through a 0.45 µM filter unit to
dispose of detached cells. Proteins in the medium were
concentrated using Amicon ultra-15 centrifugal filters
(Merck Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA). Cath-D
levels in the medium were determined by Western blot
analysis, which was performed as previously described
[66], using an anti-cath- D mouse monoclonal antibody
(ab6313; 1:1000 dilution, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA).
Band intensity was quantified using ImageJ software.
