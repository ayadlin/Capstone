ABSTRACT
Melanoma is well known for its propensity for lethal metastasis and resistance
to most current therapies. Tumor progression and drug resistance depend to a
large extent on the interplay between tumor cells and the surrounding matrix. We
previously identified Tetraspanin 8 (Tspan8) as a critical mediator of melanoma
invasion, whose expression is absent in healthy skin. The present study investigated
whether Tspan8 may influence cell-matrix anchorage and regulate downstream
molecular pathways leading to an aggressive behavior. Using silencing and ectopic
expression strategies, we showed that Tspan8-mediated invasion of melanoma
cells resulted from defects in cell-matrix anchorage by interacting with β1 integrins
and by interfering with their clustering, without affecting their surface or global
expression levels. These effects were associated with impaired phosphorylation
of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and its downstream target Akt-S473, but not FAK.
Specific blockade of Akt or ILK activity strongly affected cell-matrix adhesion.
Moreover, expression of a dominant-negative form of ILK reduced β1 integrin
clustering and cell-matrix adhesion. Finally, we observed a tumor-promoting
effect of Tspan8 in vivo and a mutually exclusive expression pattern between
Tspan8 and phosphorylated ILK in melanoma xenografts and human melanocytic
lesions. Altogether, the in vitro, in vivo and in situ data highlight a novel regulatory
role for Tspan8 in melanoma progression by modulating cell-matrix interactions
through β1 integrin-ILK axis and establish Tspan8 as a negative regulator of
ILK activity. These findings emphasize the importance of targeting Tspan8 as a
means of switching from low- to firm-adhesive states, mandatory to prevent tumor
dissemination.

INTRODUCTION

in various cell lines facilitated metastasis in mice [17–19].
The pro-migratory function of Tspan8 in epithelial cancer
relies on its interaction with several adhesion molecules
such as E-cadherin, EpCAM, claudin-7 and CD44
[15, 16]. Ectopic expression Tspan8 in Isreco colon cancer
cell line stimulated cell motility through cooperation with
the E-cadherin/p120-catenin membrane complex [20].
Conversely, Tspan8 silencing attenuated the migration
of colon cancer cells and upregulated calcium-dependent
cell-cell aggregation [21]. Overall, Tspan8 mediates
the loss of intercellular connections between malignant
epithelial cells, crucial for metastasis [22], whereas its
contribution to cell-matrix anchorage remains obscure and
has never been investigated in non-epithelial cancers. We
previously reported that Tspan8 is a hallmark of melanoma
progression, responsible for the acquisition of an invasive
phenotype [23]. Unlike carcinomas where Tspan8 is
expressed in normal cells and upregulated in tumor cells,
Tspan8 is absent at the mRNA and protein levels in normal
melanocytes and non-invasive melanoma cell lines,
whereas it is strongly expressed in melanoma cells from
a panel of invasive cell lines [23]. Accordingly, Tspan8
is undetectable in healthy skin and exclusively expressed
in primary melanomas and lymph node metastases [23].
Since aggressive melanoma cells acquire the ability to
invade surrounding tissues by changing their interactions
with the local environment, the present study investigated
whether Tspan8 may influence cell-matrix interactions
and regulate downstream targets, leading to an aggressive
behaviour.
We showed that the function of Tspan8 was unique
as compared to any other. Indeed, Tspan8 impairs
integrin-mediated anchorage of melanoma cells to matrix
components by negatively regulating ILK activity, leading
to the inhibition of its downstream target Akt-S473 and
β1 integrin clustering. Moreover, Tspan8 promotes in
vivo orthotopic tumor growth and an inverse pattern of
Tspan8 and P-ILK expression was observed in melanoma
xenografts as well as in human melanocytic lesions,
underscoring the ability of Tspan8 to modulate ILK
function in cutaneous microenvironment. Thus, our
study identified Tspan8 as a novel regulator of ILKdriven β1 integrin signaling, mediating low interactions
of melanoma cells with the surrounding extracellular
microenvironment, mandatory for tumor escape.

Melanoma is the leading cause of all skin cancer
related deaths, most likely due to its aggressiveness and
resistance to current therapies. Despite all prevention
efforts, its incidence is increasing faster than any other
cancers [1]. During melanoma progression, tumor cells first
grow within the epidermis, then acquire the ability to cross
the epidermal basement membrane, invade the dermis
and circulate to disseminate into distant organs [1]. All
these steps require making and breaking contacts between
melanoma cells and matrix components and depend to
a large extent on transmembrane receptors belonging to
the integrin family [2]. Integrins are composed of noncovalently linked α and β subunits that transduce bidirectional signals into and out of the cell [2]. Changes
in integrin expression and/or function are associated with
tumor progression through alteration of their crosstalk with
the surrounding microenvironment [3, 4]. In particular, β1
integrins contribute to the aggressive behavior of cancer
cells, resistance to chemo/radiotherapy [4] and targeted
therapies, including melanoma [5].
Extracellular ligand binding leads to integrin
clustering at cell-matrix contacts and subsequent
recruitment of a complex heterogeneous class of proteins,
including focal adhesion (FAK) and integrin linked (ILK)
kinases [6], which signal through the MEK/ERK and PI3K/
Akt pathways, both critical in melanoma progression [7].
Targeting upstream effectors of ERK with pharmacologic
inhibitors yielded promising results [8] and clinical trials
with combined PI3K and BRAF inhibitors, reported to
inhibit melanoma tumor growth in mice [9], are currently
in progress [10]. However, these targeted therapies lead
to short-term clinical benefit and nearly all patients
relapse due to acquired resistance [9, 10]. Recently, it has
been shown that integrin β1-mediated matrix adhesion
and signaling can drive melanoma resistance to BRAF
inhibition [5]. Therefore, a deep understanding on how the
integrin functions are modulated is mandatory to propose
more efficient therapeutic strategies against melanoma.
Some members of the tetraspanin family have
emerged as important regulators of expression levels,
trafficking or post-translational modification of lamininbinding integrins [11, 12]. Tetraspanins associate
laterally with one another and cluster dynamically with
a large variety of transmembrane and signal-transducing
partners, forming specialized membrane microdomains
called “tetraspanin web” [13, 14]. Disorganization of
these networks causes various diseases, including cancer,
where tetraspanins can act as suppressors or promoters of
metastasis [15, 16]. Unlike other tetraspanins, Tspan8 is
expressed in a limited number of normal tissues [16] and
its mechanism of action in modulating tumor progression
is still poorly documented. Tspan8 overexpression in
human carcinomas has been suggested to play a role in
tumor progression [15, 16] since forced Tspan8 expression

RESULTS
Tspan8 expression markedly reduces melanoma
cell anchorage to matrix components
To determine whether the Tspan8-mediated invasion
of melanoma cells [23] may result from a defect in cellmatrix anchorage, we knocked-down Tspan8 expression
in invasive cells by the previously validated SMART
pool siRNA [23]. We showed that efficient Tspan8

silencing (Figure 1A) resulted in a significant 1.8 to
2-fold increase in cell adhesion to collagen I, collagen
IV and fibronectin (Figure 1C) (p < 0.001). This effect
was not dependent on immobilized ligand density since
it was observed over a wide range of concentrations
(2.5 to 40 μg/ml; Supplementary Figure 1). Conversely,
ectopic expression of Tspan8 in non-invasive cells (at
levels comparable to that of invasive cells; Figure 1B)
resulted in a 2-fold reduction in cell adhesion to matrix
components (Figure 1D) as compared to control cells

(p < 0.001). Similar results were observed with another
clone expressing ectopic Tspan8 (not shown). Importantly,
the impact of Tspan8 silencing on adhesion was abrogated
when using the poly-L-lysine (charge interactions only)
as a substrate (Figures 1E and 1F), suggesting a possible
involvement of integrins in Tspan8-mediated function.
Indeed, pretreatment with Mn2+, a well-known potent
integrin activator [24] abolished the difference in adhesion
properties between Tspan8-positive and Tspan8-negative
cells on collagen IV (Figures 1E, 1F), fibronectin or

expressed high levels of α1, α3, α5 and β1 subunits, very
low levels of α2, αv and β3 subunits and no detectable
amounts of α4, α6, β4, β6 or β7 subunits (Figures 2A
and 2B), even when cells were seeded on collagen I, IV
or fibronectin (not shown). This was corroborated by
comparable surface levels of α1, α2, α3, α5, αv, β1 and β3
integrin subunits between non invasive cells expressing
ectopic Tspan8 and control cells (not shown).
The Tspan8-mediated effect was not limited to a
specific type of matrix protein and the β1 integrin subunit,
common to both fibronectin and collagen receptors, was
predominantly expressed in melanoma cells (Figure

Tspan8 forms a co-immunoprecipitable complex
with β1 integrin subunit and regulates its ligand
binding avidity

2A). We therefore investigated whether Tspan8 effect
on cell-matrix anchorage might be mediated through β1
integrins. A function-blocking anti-β1 integrin subunit
strongly decreased the elevated anchorage of cells devoid
of Tspan8 to a level comparable to Tspan8-expressing
cells, on both collagen IV (Figure 2C-D) and fibronectin
(not shown). Moreover, mRNA (Figure 2E) and protein
(Figure 2F) levels of β1 integrin subunit were unaltered
after Tspan8 silencing in cells adhering to uncoated or
collagen IV-coated wells. In conclusion, melanoma cellmatrix anchorage was mainly regulated by β1 integrins,
and Tspan8-weakened β1-dependent adhesiveness was not
mediated by variations in the cell surface repertoire or
protein levels of integrin subunits.

To investigate whether Tspan8 could be part of
a β1 integrin complex that might influence cell-matrix
anchorage, we immunoprecipitated Tspan8 from invasive
melanoma cells after surface biotinylation. One of the
most prominent bands observed corresponded to the
molecular weight of the β1 integrin subunit, which was
identified by sequential immunoprecipitations, using first
anti-Tspan8 antibody and then anti-β1 integrin antibody
(Figure 3A). Integrin β1 immunodetection in Tspan8immunoprecipitates from non-biotinylated melanoma cells

Tspan8 regulates cell-matrix anchorage by
impairing β1 integrin-mediated Akt activation

definitely confirmed the association of the two proteins
within a common complex (Figure 3B).
To examine whether Tspan8 may interfere with β1
integrin activation, we evaluated the accessibility of β1 to
mAbs 12G10 and P4C10, known to ligate only activated
or inactived β1 integrins respectively, regardless of the
α subunit or ligand occupancy [25]. Total β1 integrins
was assessed using a conformation-independent MAR4
antibody. Tspan8-silenced cells displayed amounts of
surface β1-integrin receptors, either at high- or lowaffinity state, comparable to those of Tspan8-expressing
cells (Figure 3C). Furthermore, Tspan8 expression did not
block the Mn2+-induced conformational activation of β1
integrin (Figure 3C), which is in line with the observation
that the Tspan8-associated reduction of cell-matrix
adhesion could be rescued by Mn2+ treatment (Figures 1E
and 1F).
We next focused on the ability of Tspan8 to affect
β1 integrin clustering by staining cells with 12G10
antibody. Tspan8 silencing increased clustering of active
β1 integrins within large streak-like focal adhesions at
the cell periphery compared to control cells (Figure 3D)
with a 2-fold increase of the clusters per cell compared to
control cells (Figure 3E; p<0.001). The opposite effect was
observed when comparing cells expressing ectopic Tspan8
to control cells (not shown). Overall, Tspan8 expression
attenuates melanoma cell-matrix anchorage by modulating
β1-ligand binding, mainly through integrin avidity.

We next analyzed the downstream effects of
impaired β1 clustering in Tspan8-expressing cells. Using
a human phospho-kinase antibody array, we compared
the phosphorylation status of up to 46 well-characterized
kinases between collagen IV-adherent cells silenced or
not for Tspan8 (Figure 5A). Surprisingly, only phosphoERK1/2 (T202/Y204; T185/Y187) and phosphoAkt-S473 exhibited a detectable phosphorylation level
that was significantly enhanced in Tspan8-depleted cells
compared to control siRNA-transfected cells (Figure
5A, 5B). We confirmed the increased phosphorylation
of Akt-S473 in Tspan8-silenced cells (Figure 5C, 5D)
whereas the increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation did not
reach statistical significance (Figure 5C, 5D). Notably,
no significant change in the phosphorylation levels of
Akt-T308 (Figure 5A-5C) and FAK (not shown) was
observed, strenghtening the above data (Figure 4A,
4B). Importantly, the phosphorylation of Akt on S473
was integrin β1-dependent. Indeed, Akt-S473 exhibits
an elevated signal in cells plated on collagen IV when
compared to cells plated on poly-L-lysine, a substrate that
does not involve integrins (Figure 5E). Besides, forcing
integrin activation by Mn2+ treatment increased Akt-S473
activation in Tspan8-expressing cells to a level similar to
Tspan8-depleted cells (Figure 5E).
To investigate whether the low phosphorylation
status of Akt-S473 in Tspan8-expressing cells contributed
to reduced-cell-matrix attachment, adhesion assays were
performed in presence of the commonly used PI3K
inhibitor LY294002, at concentrations known to prevent
phosphorylation of its downstream target Akt [28]. The
increased adhesiveness displayed by the Tspan8-depleted
cells was abolished by LY294002 (Figure 5F; n=4,
p<0.0005), with a level similar to Tspan8-expressing
cells. Furthermore, treatment of cells with GSK690693,
a conventional selective ATP competitor that leads to Akt
hyperphosphorylation [29], abrogated Tspan8-dependent
decrease of cell-matrix adhesion (n=4, p< 0.0001).
The effects of these two inhibitors on adhesion were
unlikely to be due to a change in cell-death phenotype
(Supplementary Figure 2A). Overall, these results indicate
that the weakened adhesion of Tspan8-expressing cells is
mediated through an impaired β1 integrin-mediated Akt
activation.

Tspan8 silencing causes enhanced codistribution
of β1 integrin with P-FAK at focal adhesions,
without affecting FAK autophosphorylation
Integrin clustering induced by cell-matrix attachment
results in autophosphorylation of FAK on tyrosine 397
(P-FAK; [26]), a central focal adhesion protein recruited
to the β1 integrin cytoplasmic domain and upregulated
in many types of cancer, including melanoma [27]. We
therefore investigated whether Tspan8-induced reduction
of β1-integrin clustering could lead to alterations in the
expression, phosphorylation status or distribution of FAK.
Tspan8 silencing slightly increased the phosphorylation
level of FAK in cells adhering to the matrix, but this
effect was nonetheless not significant (Figure 4A and
4B; p = 0.227). Moreover, FAK colocalized with active
β1-integrins at the cell-substratum interface and almost
all active β1-integrins clusters were positive for FAK,
regardless of Tspan8 expression (Figure 4C, merge, inset
and Figure 4E). Remarkably, the majority of P-FAK
spots colocalized with active β1 integrins in Tspan8silenced cells, but not in control siRNA-transfected cells
(Figure 4D, merge, inset and Figure 4E). So, loss of
Tspan8 expression enhances the co-distribution of active
β1 integrins with P-FAK at focal adhesions, without
interfering with FAK autophosphorylation.

Tspan8 modulates β1 integrin-dependent
adhesion and clustering through ILK activity
The weakened adhesive function of Tspan8 relies
mainly on attenuated integrin-mediated Akt-S473
phosphorylation (Figure 5A–5E). The integrin-linked
kinase (ILK) is a key regulator of cell-matrix adhesion,
which interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of β1

integrin subunit [30] and plays a crucial role in melanoma
progression [31]. ILK activation is involved in Akt
phosphorylation on S473 in a PI3K-dependent manner
[30]. We therefore investigated whether ILK activity
could account for elevated Akt-S473 phosphorylation
level in Tspan8-depleted cells. We observed a strong
ILK phosphorylation (Figure 6A) that coincides with
an increase of Akt-S473 phosphorylation (Figure 5E).
Remarkably, Mn2+ treatment, which locks integrins into
high-affinity status, nearly completely restored collagen
IV-induced phosphorylation of ILK in Tspan8-expressing
cells to the level observed in Tspan8-silenced cells (Figure
6A), as observed above for Akt-S473 (Figure 5C), whereas

total ILK levels remained unchanged. These results
suggest that Tspan8 may affect β1 integrin-dependent cell
adhesion by modulating the ILK activity and consequently
Akt-S473 phosphorylation.
We further explored the functional involvement
of ILK by using a selective inhibitor of ILK, QLT0267
[32], and the dominant-negative kinase-deficient form of
ILK (E359K; [33]) in invasive T1C3 cells stably depleted
of endogenous Tspan8 (Figure 6B). As after transient
silencing of Tspan8, stable Tspan8 depletion led to a 2-fold
increase in integrin-dependent adhesion (Figure 6C; p<
0.001) and QLT0267 treatment in these cells drastically
reduced cell-matrix adherence to the level measured in

Tspan8-expressing cells (Figure 6C). The same phenotype
was observed after LY294002 treatment (not shown).
Alternatively, transient expression of ILK E359K reversed
the increased cell-matrix adhesion of Tspan8-silenced cells
back to the level seen in Tspan8-expressing cells (Figure
6D). The transduction efficiency of ILK E359K mutant
was confirmed through the suppression of Akt-S473
phosphorylation (Figure 6E). Phosphorylation of T308
of Akt, a residue not reported as a target of ILK, was
unchanged in all cells (Figure 6E). Inhibition of cellmatrix adherence was not due to changes in cell survival
since the number of adherent cells treated or not with

QLT0267 or transfected with ILK mutant was similar after
10 hours growth to that of control cells (Supplementary
Figure 2B). Thus, Tspan8-induced reduction of cell-matrix
adhesion is most likely due to low ILK activity.
ILK is thought to be a critical regulator of ß1integrin avidity [34]. Since Tspan8 expression had a
negative effect on ß1-integrin clustering, we tested
whether changes of Tspan8-dependent ILK status could
impact ß1 integrin clustering. Inhibition of endogenous
ILK activity using dominant-negative ILK mutant
decreased the number of active ß1 integrin clusters at the
cell periphery of Tspan8-silenced cells to a value similar to

the excised xenografts and immunohistochemical staining
of tumors confirmed that cells retained the expressed or
silenced Tspan8 (Figure 7D, 7H). Importantly, P-ILK
expression was remarkably strong in Tspan8-deleted
tumors and very low in Tspan8-expressing tumors (Figure
7D, 7H).
We then evaluated the clinical relevance of these
results by analyzing P-ILK expression in human primary
melanomas (n= 21) and benign nevi (n=13), previously
selected and shown to strongly or faintly express Tspan8,
respectively [23]. P-ILK staining was observed in benign
nevi, although with variable intensity (strong: 9/13; weak

4/13), but never detected in primary melanomas (Figure
7H), demonstrating a mutually exclusive expression of
Tspan8 and P-ILK. Thus, the in vivo and in situ findings
strengthened the evidences pointing towards the ability of
Tspan8 to inhibit ILK activity, allowing the appearance of
a more aggressive phenotype.

DISCUSSION
Impairment of tumor cell-matrix and intercellular
communication is a prerequisite for invasion and
metastasis. Although Tspan8 has emerged as a key

regulator of epithelial cell-cell interactions, mostly through
interaction with α6β4 integrin [35], and E-cadherin [20],
very few is known for Tspan8 role in regulating cellmatrix adhesion. To our knowledge, only one report
showed that Tspan8 silencing in HT29 colon cancer cells
led to increased adhesiveness to laminins [21]. However,
the signaling events by which Tspan8 regulates integrin
functions have not yet been addressed.
Our data are the first to establish Tspan8 as a
negative regulator of ILK activity, thus inhibiting β1
integrin-mediated anchorage to matrix required for
allowing melanoma invasion. Importantly, the effects
of Tspan8 on β1 integrin-dependent cell adhesion
was observed regardless of the type of matrix protein
(fibronectin or collagens), implying that this effect is not
restricted to specific α/β1-integrin heterodimers. Indeed,
a blocking antibody specific to the β1 subunit drastically
diminished adhesion to all these different ligands. The
effect was also shown to be due to reduced integrin β1ligand binding through avidity (clustering) rather than to
matrix affinity (conformation) or expression level.
Clustering of ligated integrins leads to the formation
of focal adhesions, establishing a platform that regulates
signaling events. FAK and ILK kinases are the two major
adaptors that form a complex with the cytoplasmic tail
of β1 integrin subunit and intracellularly propagate the
signal transduced from adhesion sites. Interestingly,
Tspan8 ablation significantly affected ILK activation
in melanoma cells adhering to the matrix but not FAK
autophosphorylation. This was associated with an enhanced
phosphorylation status of the ILK downstream target Akt,
and a concomitant increase in β1-integrin clustering. It is
noteworthy that Mn2+ treatment enhanced the β1-dependent
cell adhesion capacity of cells expressing Tspan8 to the
same level as in Tspan8-negative cells, and triggered a
concomitant increase in the phosphorylation status of
ILK and Akt-S473. These effects were not observed when
cells were plated on poly-L-lysine, a substrate that does
not engage integrin, demonstrating the integrin specific
liability of this process.
ILK is a key upstream regulator of Akt
phosphorylation on S473 that modulates cell-matrix
anchorage [36, 37]. Although T308 phosphorylation is
sufficient for Akt activation, S473 phosphorylation is
required for optimal Akt activity. The fact that Tspan8
expression interfered only with Akt-S473 and not with
Akt-T308 phosphorylation suggests that Tspan8 restricts
full Akt activity in melanoma cells through inappropriate
ILK activation, leading to attenuation of β1-integrin
adhesive function. ILK interacts with Rictor to mediate
Akt-S473 phosphorylation in different cell types [38]
and Rictor may interact with Tspan8 in glioma cells
[39]. Although the implication of Rictor in melanoma
cells awaits further studies, we clearly demonstrate that
in the absence of Tspan8, ILK-dependent Akt-S473
phosphorylation in response to ligation of β1 integrins
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

occurs efficiently, leading to integrin clustering. Blockade
of PI3K or ILK signaling by the pharmacologic inhibitors
LY294002 or QLT0267 resulted in reduced cell-matrix
interaction, as did the expression of the dominant negative
ILK E359K. Overall, our data demonstrate that Tspan8
modulation of β1-integrin function occurred mainly
through ILK/Akt regulatory axis, resulting in a low degree
of β1-integrin clustering at the cell surface leading to
reduced cell-matrix anchorage.
Although numerous studies associated ILK activity
with the conformational status of β1-integrins, few
focused on its involvement in integrin clustering. We
showed here that ILK E359K mutant caused a decrease in
the number of β1-integrin clusters, leading to attenuated
cell-matrix adhesion. It was previously reported that this
ILK mutant acts in a dominant-negative fashion in several
ILK signaling-dependent processes, in particular in cell
adhesion [40, 41], probably due to its inability to bind
paxillin [42], a scaffolding adaptor known to form bridges
between integrins and FAK. Here, we did not observe any
significant changes in FAK autophosphorylation between
cells silenced or nor for Tspan8. Since the effects of ILK
E359K mutant on matrix-adhesion in Tspan8-negative
cells mimicked those obtained in Tspan8-expressing cells,
it seems unlikely that Tspan8 prevents interaction of β1integrins with FAK-paxillin, especially as Tspan8 loss
has no impact on paxillin phosphorylation, as observed
on the kinase array (not shown). A recent study reported
that siRNA-knockdown of Tspan8 in glioma cells reduced
FAK-Y397 phosphorylation and decreased in vitro cell
proliferation rate [43]. Moreover, Tspan8 exerts a promigratory function of epithelial cells through its association
with the laminin-binding receptor α6β4, leading to FAK
activation [12, 16]. Since the modulation of the expression
of Tspan8 does not affect the in vitro proliferation and
motility of melanoma cells [23], it may be postulated that
Tspan8 specifically modulates cell-matrix adhesion and
invasion phenotypes in cutaneous melanoma, whereas
it regulates proliferation and migration in other cancers,
independently and dependently of FAK, respectively.
Reduced clustering of ligated integrins strongly
influences their function and signaling [44], and may
arise as a result of altered lateral diffusion of integrins
[45]. Using fluorescence photobleaching experiments,
we previously reported that high- and low-agressive
melanoma cells displayed clear-cut differences in the
lateral motion of glycoproteins in the plasma membrane
[46]. Furthermore, it has been reported that the tetraspanin
CD151, known to upregulate melanoma cell motility
[47], was able to disturb the mode of integrin diffusion
at the plasma membrane [48]. In this context, and given
that integrin clustering seems to be driven mainly by the
β-subunit rather than the α-subunit [49], it is tempting
to speculate that Tspan8, by interacting laterally with
integrins of the β1 subfamily, restricts their diffusion and
thereby their clustering, regardless of the α-associated
17150

subunit. This is consistent with the fact that Tspan8 formed
an immunoprecipitable complex with β1 integrins at the
surface of invasive melanoma cells and reduced adhesion
to a wide range of ligands.
Tspan8 expression in invasive melanoma cells
was responsible for inhibition of ILK phosphorylation
and its downstream target Akt-S473, concomitantly with
reduced adhesiveness. These in vitro findings have in
vivo significance, since we found that the expression of
Tspan8 is inversely correlated with ILK phosphorylation
in melanoma xenografts and in human melanocytic lesions.
These data highlight an inverse relationship between
Tspan8 expression and ILK activity with respect to disease
progression, further supporting an involvement of Tspan8ILK regulation in cutaneous melanomas. In summary, using
a combination of in vitro, in vivo and in situ approaches,
we uncovered a hitherto unappreciated function of Tspan8
in negatively regulating β1 integrin-dependent adhesion
and avidity through ILK, which sets off the aggressiveness
of melanoma cells by decreasing adhesive interaction with
the surrounding matrix environment and promoting tumor
escape. Since invasive Tspan8-positive cells also expressed
peanut agglutinin lectin (PNA)-binding sites [23], reported
to be associated with a propensity for dermal invasion [50],
in vivo metastasis [51], and with poor clinical outcome of
patients [52, 53], it is conceivable that Tspan8 identifies
tumor cell subpopulations with low adhesive potential, able
to escape from the primary tumor and move unhindered
in the matrix environment to circulate and metastasize.
Hence, Tspan8 may represent a promising target for both
early detection and anti-invasive therapies in cutaneous
melanoma. Indeed, targeting Tspan8 to switch from a
"nonsticky" to a "sticky" state may provide a means to
prevent the spread of aggressive cells and thus, metastasis.
This strategy is consistent with recent data identifying
Tspan8 as a blood biomarker candidate for early detection
of human colon cancer [54], and demonstrating that
Tspan8-specific antibodies reduce the incidence of ovarian
cancer metastasis [55].

human Tspan8 (TS29 clone) was a generous gift from Dr
C. Boucheix (Inserm U602, Villejuif).

Cell lines and culture
Non-invasive IC8 and invasive T1C3 human
melanoma clones were selected from the same parental
cell line and described in [23]. T1C3 cells expressed high
level of Tspan8 [23], invade dermis in skin reconstructs
[50], and promote lung metastases in immunosuppressed
newborn rats [51]. Conversely, IC8 cells did not express
Tspan8, are unable to form metastasis in animals and
to invade dermis in skin reconstructs [50, 51]. They
were cultured under standard conditions and tested as
mycoplasma-free as previously described [23].

Transient Tspan8 silencing
ON-TARGET plus human TSPAN8 siRNA
SMARTpool (Dharmacon, Chicago, IL, USA), was
previously selected based on silencing potency and lack
of off-target effects on T1C3 melanoma cells [23]. Briefly,
T1C3 melanoma cells were transfected with 5 nM of
TSPAN8 siRNA SMARTpool or control ON-TARGET
plus non-targeting pool siRNA. Tspan8 knockdown was
checked using QPCR, flow cytometry and western blot.

Transient expression of ILK-E359K

MATERIALS AND METHODS

T1C3 melanoma cells stably depleted or not for
endogenous Tspan8 were transiently transfected with
250μg of empty or ILK-E359K (dominant-negative)
pcDNA6-myc vector using JetPei (Ozyme), according
to the manufacturer instructions. This vector provided by
Dr S. Dedhar (British Columbia Cancer Research Center,
Vancouver, Canada) has been previously described in
detail [33]. Cells were harvested 48h after transfection and
subjected to adhesion assay, confocal analysis or Western
blotting.

Antibodies

Stable Tspan8-positive and negative clones

The monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against
integrins: beta1 (MAR4 clone), alpha1 (SR84 clone),
alpha2 (12F1-H6 clone), alpha3 (C3 II-1 clone), alpha4
(9F10 clone), alpha5 (VC5 clone) were purchased
from BD Pharmingen (Le Pont de Claix, France) and
alpha V (M9 clone), beta3 (VI-PL2 clone), beta5 (P1F6
clones), beta6 (10D5 clones) from Millipore (Mannheim,
Germany). Were also used for Western blotting and flow
cytometry the antibodies against P-ERK (sc-738), ERK
(C-16) and FAK (A-17 clone) from Santa Cruz, CA;

Stable cell clones expressing ectopic Tspan8 (IC8/
Tspan8) were generated by transfecting IC8 cells with
pCDNA3-Tspan8 (a generous gift from C. Boucheix;
Villejuif, France) followed by G418 antibiotic selection.
Endogenous Tspan8 was silenced in T1C3 cells after
puromycin selection of clones stably expressing HuSH
29-mer Tspan8-shRNA (Origene Technologies, Rockville,
MD, USA). Successful expression or knockdown of
Tspan8 was confirmed by QPCR, immunoblotting and
flow cytometry.

Cell attachment assay

For re-immunoprecipitation experiments, associated
proteins were eluted using a 1% Triton X100 buffer and
then precipitated a second time with the indicated mAbconjugated sepharose beads for 1 hour at 4°C.

Ninety-six-microwell plates were coated overnight
at 4 °C with fibronectin, collagen IV, collagen I or polyL-Lysine (10 μg/ml; BD Biosciences,). The cells were
detached after over-night serum starvation and seeded on
wells previously blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin
at 6 × 104 cells/well density for 30min at 37°C. Additional
experiments were accomplished after a pre-incubation of
30min with saturating concentrations of function-blocking
anti-β1-integrin, control antibodies, pharmacological
inhibitors, in presence or absence of 1mM Mn2+. After
staining with DAPI, images of the total well surface area
were acquired using Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope and
a Coolsnap HQ2 camera with a 10x objective. The total
number of adherent cells per well was counted using NIH
Image J software.

Western blotting analysis
Immunoblotting were carried out as previously
described [23]. Densitometric analysis was performed
using Image J software (National Institutes of Health,
USA). Data are presented as values directly below the
blots and are representative of at least three independent
experiments.

Confocal microscopy
Melanoma cells allowed to attach on collagen
IV-coated circular glass coverslips for indicated times
(1h-12h) were fixed with PBS/4% paraformaldehyde and
5% sucrose, permeabilized with 1% Brij 97 and blocked
with 10% heat-inactivated goat serum. Staining of cells
with indicated antibodies was performed overnight at 4°C.
After incubation with secondary fluorochorme conjugated
antibodies, the coverslips were mounted in the antifade
reagent Mowiol. Fluorescence staining was visualized
with LSM510META laser scanning confocal microscope
(Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) using a Zeiss PlanApochromat 63x/1.4 oil objective. Immunofluorescence
images were acquired at high confocality (pinhole = 1
Airy unit) to achieve the thinnest possible optical slices
at the substrate–cell interface. To determine the number
of clusters for each experiment, we considered random
fields with a total cell number over 50 cells per experiment
(n =2).

Flow cytometry
Cell surface labeling and intracellular staining were
performed as previously described [23, 56]. Results were
normalized by subtracting the MFI of the appropriate
control and expressed by the mean (3 independent
experiments) of MFI +/- SD or the ratio of MFI of Tspan8positive cells /MFI of Tspan8-negative cells.

Phospho-kinase array
The relative site-specific phosphorylation of
46 kinases was analyzed using the Human PhosphoKinase Array Kit from R&D Systems according to the
protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, 48h after
transfection of T1C3 cells with control or Tspan8 siRNA,
cells were serum-starved for 12h, seeded on collagen
IV-coated flask for 2h and lysed with the recommended
lysis buffer. The chemiluminescence signal intensity of
individual spot was analyzed using Quantity One 1-D
Analysis Software (BIO-RAD, Marnes-la-Coquette,
France).

Animals and tumor xenografts
Six- to 8-weeks old male Swiss Nude mice (Charles
River, l'Arbresle, France) were housed at the animal
facilities of the UMR990 (Clermont-Ferrand, France),
under specific pathogen-free conditions, in accordance
with the guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals (National Research Council, 1996) and European
Directive (86/609/EEC). Cells stably expressing or
silenced for Tspan8 were injected subcutaneously into
mouse flank region (1 × 106 cells per flank; 6 mice for
each group; n=2). Tumor growth was monitored 3 times
per week; measured using a caliper. Tumor volume
was calculated according to the formula: V = 0.52 × d2
× D (D=largest diameter, d=smallest diameter). 7 to
8 weeks after, mice were sacrificed and tumors were
weighed before being fixed in 4% formalin, embedded
and sectioned for histology and immunohistochemistry
analysis. In some experiments, melanoma cells were
mechanically dissociated from tumors, immediately
stained for Tspan8 and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Immunoprecipitation experiments
Cell surface biotinylation and immunoprecipitation
procedures were performed as previously described
[57]. Briefly, cells were incubated with PBS/2.5 mg EZLinkSulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) at
4°C for 1 h and the biotinylation reaction was terminated
by addition of Tris-HCl 50 mM, pH 7.5. Cells were lysed
using 1% Brij97 (Sigma, St Louis, MO) buffer. After 30
min at 4°C, insoluble material was removed and the cell
lysate was precleared for 2h using heat inactivated goat
serum and protein G sepharose beads (GE Healthcare,
England). The cell extracts were then incubated with
control or specific mAb directly conjugated to sepharose
4B for 2 h, washed and eluted with Laemmli buffer.
