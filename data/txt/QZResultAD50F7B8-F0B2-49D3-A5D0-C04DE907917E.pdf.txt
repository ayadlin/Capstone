KRAS mutation is a predictive biomarker for resistance to cetuximab (Erbitux®) in metastatic
colorectal cancer (mCRC). This study sought to determine if KRAS mutant CRC lines could be
sensitized to cetuximab using dasatinib (BMS-354825, sprycel®) a potent, orally bioavailable
inhibitor of several tyrosine kinases, including the Src Family Kinases. We analyzed 16 CRC lines
for: 1) KRAS mutation status, 2) dependence on mutant KRAS signaling, 3) expression level of
EGFR and SFKs. From these analyses, we selected three KRAS mutant (LS180, LoVo, and
HCT116) cell lines, and two KRAS wild type cell lines (SW48 and CaCo2). In vitro, using PolyD-Lysine/laminin plates, KRAS mutant cell lines were resistant to cetuximab whereas parental
controls showed sensitivity to cetuximab. Treatment with cetuximab and dasatinib showed a
greater anti-proliferative effect on KRAS mutant line as compared to either agent alone both in
vitro and in vivo. To investigate potential mechanisms for this anti-proliferative response in the
combinatorial therapy we performed Human Phospho-kinase Antibody Array analysis measuring
the relative phosphorylation levels of phosphorylation of 39 intracellular proteins in untreated,
cetuximab, dasatinib or the combinatorial treatment in LS180, LoVo and HCT116 cells. The
results of this experiment showed a decrease in a broad spectrum of kinases centered on the βcatenin pathway, the classical MAPK pathway, AKT/mTOR pathway and the family of STAT
transcription factors when compared to the untreated control or monotherapy treatments. Next we
analyzed tumor growth with cetuximab, dasatinib or the combination in vivo. KRAS mutant
xenografts showed resistance to cetuximab therapy, whereas KRAS wild type demonstrated an
anti-tumor response when treated with cetuximab. KRAS mutant tumors exhibited minimal
response to dasatinib monotherapy. However, as in vitro, KRAS mutant lines exhibited a response
to the combination of cetuximab and dasatinib. Combinatorial treatment of KRAS mutant
xenografts resulted in decreased cell proliferation as measured by Ki67 and higher rates of
apoptosis as measured by TUNEL. The data presented herein indicate that dasatinib can sensitize
KRAS mutant CRC tumors to cetuximab and may do so by altering the activity of several key-

necessary for cell proliferation and survival of KRAS mutant CRC tumors. This data strengthen
the rationale for clinical trials in this genetic setting combining cetuximab and dasatinib.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a member of the HER family of receptor
tyrosine kinases and consists of four members: EGFR (ErbB1/HER1), HER2/Neu (ErbB2),
HER3 (ErbB3) and HER4 (ErbB4). Stimulation of the receptor through ligand binding
activates the intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinase and promotes receptor homo- or
heterodimerization with HER family members. EGFR activation leads to the downstream
stimulation of several signaling cascades, including RAS/RAF/ERK/MAPK,
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K/Akt) pathway and the phospholipase C-protein kinase C
(PLCg/PKC) pathway. In addition, several other pathways are activated including Src family
kinase (SFKs) and the Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs).
Collectively, these pathways influence several cellular responses including cell proliferation,
survival, angiogenesis, migration, and metastasis (reviewed in (Abram and Courtneidge,
2000; Biscardi et al., 1999b; Blume-Jensen and Hunter, 2001; Marmor et al., 2004; Prenzel
et al., 2001; Schlessinger, 2000; Yarden and Sliwkowski, 2001)). Aberrant expression or
activity of the EGFR is linked to the etiology of several human epithelial cancers including
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
brain cancer and colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, the EGFR has emerged as one of the
most promising molecular targets in oncology.

Although EGFR is activated through ligand binding and autophosphorylation of its
cytoplasmic tail, it is well established that Src, or Src family kinases (SFKs), are necessary
for full activation of the EGFR (Biscardi et al., 1999a). Src is the prototype member of a
family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases (nRTKs) including Src, Yes, Fyn, Lyn, Lck, Hck
Fgr, Blk and Yrk. These cytoplasmic membrane associated nRTKs are transducers of
mitogenic signaling emanating from a number of RTKs including EGFR, HER2, fibroblast
growth factor receptor (FGFR), platelet derived growth factor (PDFGR), colony-stimulating
factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) and hepatocyte growth receptor (Belsches et al., 1997; Bowman
et al., 2001; DeMali et al., 1999; Mao et al., 1997; Muthuswamy et al., 1994; Tice et al.,
1999). Investigations into the molecular interactions between SFKs and EGFR have
revealed that SFKs can physically associate with activated EGFR (Belsches-Jablonski et al.,
2001; Maa et al., 1995; Muthuswamy and Muller, 1995). This interaction results in a
conformational change in the SFK and leads to autophophorylation at Y419 and transient
activity (Xu et al., 1999). This interaction of SFKs with RTKs can result in enhanced or
synergistic SFK activation and has been demonstrated in tumor types, most notably in
HNSCC, NSCLC and CRC (Fu et al., 2008; Koppikar et al., 2008; Mao et al., 1997; Zhang
et al., 2007).

Activation of SFKs occurs with high frequency during the development of CRC. An
increase in SFK activity in CRC tumors as compared to normal adjacent mucosa has been
reported (Bolen et al., 1987; Cartwright et al., 1989). In addition, activation of SFKs was
reported at an early stage of colorectal tumor development in polyps with high malignant
potential but not in small benign polyps of the colon (Cartwright et al., 1990). Further,
premalignant ulcerative colitis epithelium has been reported to have elevated SFK activity
(Cartwright et al., 1994), suggesting that SFKs activity may be a critical step in the
development from non-malignant to malignant transformation in CRC. Talamonti et al
reported increased activity and expression of SFKs in progressive stages of human
colorectal cancer, suggesting that colon cancer progression may be dependent on increased
SFK protein level and subsequent activity (Talamonti et al., 1993). Similar studies by
Termuhlen et al looking at colorectal metastases to either the liver or the regional lymph
nodes exhibited increased SFK activity levels when compared to the primary tumor
(Termuhlen et al., 1993). Collectively these studies suggest a putative link between
increased SFK activity and metastatic potential. Irby et al indicated that overexpression of
normal c-Src in poorly metastatic human colon cancer cells enhances primary tumor growth
but not the metastatic potential of these cancers (Irby et al., 1997). Additional studies by
Irby et al cited that activating mutations in Src, as compared to increased expression and
activity of Src, in a subset of human colorectal cancers might have a role in the malignant
progression of human CRC (Irby et al., 1999). It has been reported that increased SFK
expression occurs in approximately 80% of CRC specimens when compared to the normal
adjacent colonic epithelium (Hurwitz et al., 2004). Recent studies looking at 64 individual
CRC cell lines found a striking diversity of SFK activity. The authors reported that all lines
tested depended on SFK activity for growth and concluded from this work SFK activity is
important for the growth of CRC lines (Emaduddin et al., 2008). In addition to SFK activity
and CRC progression, SFK activity has been reported as a marker of poor clinical prognosis
(Aligayer et al., 2002). Collectively these investigations provide a wide body of evidence
implicating Src and its family of kinases in CRC development and progression (for further
review (Summy and Gallick, 2003)). Regardless of the form of activation, activated SFKs
lead to the phosphorylation of several targets including the EGFR, STATS, PLCγ, PKCs,
FAK, RAS, RAF and mucin 1 (MUC1) (Biscardi et al., 2000; Bivona et al., 2003; Blake et
al., 1999; Bromberg et al., 1998; Chiu et al., 2002; Denning et al., 1996; Fabian et al., 1993;
Joseloff et al., 2002; Kijima et al., 2002; Kronfeld et al., 2000; Li et al., 1994; Li and Kufe,
2001; Li et al., 2001a; Li et al., 2001b; McLean et al., 2005; Schaller et al., 1994; Yu et al.,
1995).

Targeting EGFR has been intensely pursued in the last decade and has resulted in the FDA
approval of five new molecular targeting agents since 2003 in four distinct solid tumors
including metastatic, NSCLC, HNSCC, breast cancer and colorectal cancer (mCRC). One
molecular strategy of EGFR inhibition has been the development of monoclonal antibodies
(mAb, cetuximab and panitumumab) directed against the extracellular domain of the EGFR.
This approach results in 1) blockade of endogenous ligand binding to the receptor, 2)
inhibition of dimerization with other HER family members and 3) receptor internalization
and degradation. Cetuximab and panitumumab have been approved for the treatment of
mCRC when used alone or in combination with irinotecan in patients with irinotecan-

refractory mCRC (cetuximab) or as a single agent in patients who do not respond to all
available chemotherapies (panitumumab).

Author Manuscript

Despite the approval of this promising biological therapeutics many individuals do not
respond to this class of drug. Intensive clinical trials have evaluated the outcomes of patients
with mCRC in relation to their KRAS mutational status. The conclusions of this analysis
demonstrated a strong correlation between mutated KRAS and a lack of response to
cetuximab therapy indicating that KRAS status as a predictive factor (Amado et al., 2008;
Bokemeyer et al., 2008; De Roock et al., 2008; Di Fiore et al., 2007; Karapetis et al., 2008;
Khambata-Ford et al., 2007; Lievre et al., 2008; Punt et al., 2008; Van Cutsem et al., 2008).
One the basis of these clinical trials ASCO published guidelines that strongly support the
use of anti-EGFR antibodies in mCRC patients with wild type KRAS status (Allegra et al.,
2009; Bardelli and Siena, 2010). These guidelines leave very few therapeutic options for
mCRC patients harboring a KRAS mutation.
In this report we investigated whether or not targeting the EGFR, using cetuximab, and
SFKs, using the broad spectrum inhibitor dasatinib, in the KRAS mutant colorectal setting
would lead to anti-proliferative effects on colon tumor growth. We found that dasatinib
treatment could sensitize KRAS mutant, cetuximab resistant cells to cetuximab therapy in
vitro and in vivo. This combinatorial therapy led to altered signaling in 1) components of the
MAPK pathway, 2) the β-catenin pathway and 3) the activation of several members of the
STAT family of transcription factors. Taken together this suggests that the EGFR and SFKs
play a role in the KRAS mutant CRC setting and that dual targeting the EGFR and SFKs
with dasatinib and cetuximab may be a beneficial approach in this genetic subset of mCRC
patients.

RESULTS
Characterization and selection of KRAS mutant colorectal tumor lines

Author Manuscript

We screened 16 CRC lines for the expression of EGFR and SFKs (Figure 1A). Fourteen of
the 16 lines expressed EGFR and all lines expressed SFKs. Relative EGFR and SFK
expression was quantitated using ImageJ and normalized to Colo320DM and SW620 for
EGFR and SW48 for total SFK. Next we screened each line for KRAS mutations at codon 12
and 13 and for BRAF mutations at codon 600 by pyrosequencing (Figure 1B). Nine of 16
lines had a KRAS mutation. Four cell lines (LS123, LS180, SW480, and SW620) had a
mutation at codon 12, whereas five lines (DLD1, HCT115, HCT116, LoVo, and SW1417)
had a mutation at codon 13. Two of the 16 lines (HT29 and WiDR) demonstrated BRAF
mutations. BRAF mutations were analyzed to ensure that selected lines were mutated for
KRAS only. To further analyze these tumor cells, we performed in vivo tumor growth
analysis to determine ability of each CRC cell line to grow in a xenograft model. For this
analysis 1.0 X 106 were inoculated into the dorsal flank of athymic nude mice and allowed
to grow for 4 weeks. Tumors that reached a minimum size of 500 mm3 were considered
xenograftable. The results of this study showed that 12 of 16 lines were able to form tumors
in vivo (annotated with an asterisk in Figure 1A). From these results we selected three
lines LS180, LoVo and HCT116 for further studies. To determine their dependence on
KRAS we performed proliferation assays using siRNAs targeting KRAS (Figure 1C).

Results from this study showed that each line had dependence on mutated KRAS for
proliferation. Significant reductions of KRAS protein levels were demonstrated by Western
blot analysis for KRAS knockdown in these experiments (Figure 1C inset). In addition,
these lines were also screened for other known dasatinib targets such as EphA2, c-KIT and
PDGFR. However, Western blot analysis did not detect expression of these proteins in the
three KRAS mutant lines (data not shown). Collectively, this analysis of CRC lines led to
the selection of three KRAS mutant, EGFR- and SFK-expressing lines (LS180, LoVo,
HCT116), two KRAS wild type lines expressing EGFR and SFKs (CaCo2, SW48), and one
non-EGFR expressing KRAS wild type control line (Colo320DM).

We performed a series of in vitro experiments using two KRAS wild type (CaCo2 and
SW48) and three KRAS mutant lines (LS180, LoVo and HCT116) to investigate the
mechanisms of sensitization of KRAS mutant CRC lines to cetuximab using dasatinib. To
determine if KRAS mutant lines were resistant to cetuximab therapy in vitro we performed a
series of proliferation assays using plastic plates, fibronectin, laminin, fibronectin/laminin
coated plates or Poly D-lysine/laminin (PDL/laminin) coated plates. KRAS mutant CRC cell
lines were sensitive to cetuximab on plastic and fibronectin plates (data not shown),
however, when plated on PDL/laminin plates, KRAS mutant lines showed decreased
response to cetuximab whereas KRAS wild type lines showed increased sensitivity to
cetuximab (Figure 2A). These results mimic clinical and in vivo findings. Therefore we used
PDL/laminin plates for all in vitro studies. Next we examined if dasatinib could sensitize
KRAS mutant CRC lines to cetuximab therapy. We performed proliferation assays on PDL/
laminin plates using DMSO control, 100 nM cetuximab, 50 nM dasatinib or the combination
on LS180, LoVo and HCT116 cell lines. The results of these experiments indicated the 1)
KRAS mutant lines were resistant to cetuximab 2) dasatinib induced mild growth inhibition
on KRAS mutant lines and 3) but the combination of the two drugs exhibited abrogation of
cell proliferation (Figure 2B). Figure 2C shows the effects of cetuximab, dasatinib and the
combination on their respective kinase targets in KRAS mutant CRC cell lines. These results
suggest that signaling via the EGFR and SFKs may be necessary for cell proliferation and
survival of KRAS mutant CRC tumors. This data strengthen the rationale for clinical trials
in this genetic setting combining cetuximab and dasatinib.
Treatment of KRAS mutant CRC lines with dasatinib plus cetuximab results in distinct
alterations of phospho-kinase activity

Author Manuscript

The development of CRC is characterized by a number of events that lead the normal
mucosa through a transformation to dysplastic lesions, adenoma, adenocarcinoma in situ and
finally to invasive adenocarcinoma. Some of the events lead to deregulated expression and
ultimate over activation in the EGFR, KRAS and SFK signaling pathways. Many other
alterations have been well documented cell signaling pathways that lead to CRC (Fearon and
Vogelstein, 1990). Given the beneficial results seen by the combination of dasatinib and
cetuximab in each of the three KRAS mutant lines (Figure 2C) we were curious about
potential mechanistic underpinnings that may have resulted in this beneficial effect. Given
the complexity and cross-talk of each of these pathways we elected to perform Human
Phospho-kinase array analysis on each KRAS mutant line (LS180, LoVo and HCT116)

treated with vehicle, cetuximab (500 nM), dasatinib (50 nM), or the combination to gain an
aerial view. This Human Phospho-kinase array analyzed 39 individual proteins involved in
cellular proliferation and survival. Each cell line was plated on PDL/laminin plates and
allowed to adhere overnight. Vehicle, cetuximab, dasatinib or the combination were placed
onto the cells and allowed to incubate for 24 hours. Protein lysates were collected and
Human Phospho-kinase Arrays were analyzed for each treatment group in all three cell
lines. The results of this series of experimentations were quantitated for each line and
summarized in Figure 3. Interestingly the results of this study showed a very unique kinase
signature for each cell line treated with the cetuximab, dasatinib or the combination.

Author Manuscript

Phospho-array analysis of LS180 identified several pathways, which were downregulated by
the combination of dasatinib and cetuximab. These pathways included the AKT/mTOR/p70
S6 kinase pathway (AKT and p70 S6 Kinase), MAPK/RSK (RSK1/2/3) and components of
the β-catenin pathway (GSK α/β and β-catenin). In addition to signaling pathways several
key transcription factors were down regulated including, STAT1, STAT3, STAT4,
STAT5A/B, STAT6 and p53. Other signaling molecules that were down regulated in the
combination group include: eNOS, and p27. Figure 3A presents in histogram form the
notable changes.

Author Manuscript

In LoVo the members of the MAPK signaling pathway appeared to be down regulated with
the combination of dasatinib and cetuximab including MEK 1/2 and MSK 1/2. In regards to
transcription factor activity, the combination of dasatinib and cetuximab resulted modulation
of phosphorylation of several STAT family members including STAT2, STAT3, STAT5A,
STAT5B and STAT6. Other signaling molecules that were down regulated with the
combination treatment were; AMPKα1, HSP27 and most notably FAK. Figure 3B presents
in histogram form the notable changes.
Phospho-array analysis of HCT116 identified similar pathways as in LS180, These
pathways included the AKT/mTOR/p70 S6 kinase pathway (AKT and p70 S6 Kinase),
MAPK/RSK (RSK1/2/3) and components of the β-catenin pathway (GSK α/β and βcatenin). However, like LS180 and LoVo the combination seemed to have effects on the
STAT transcription factor family including STAT1, STAT2, STAT4, STAT5A, STAT5B,
and STAT6. Other signaling molecules that were down regulated in the combination group
include: p27, Paxillin, and AMPKa1. Figure 3C presents in histogram form the notable
changes.

Author Manuscript

Collectively these results suggest that three independent KRAS mutant, cetuximab resistant
CRC tumor lines, have several shared cell signaling pathways effected by the combination
of cetuximab and dasatinib with the most notable similarities in the MAPK pathway, AKT/
mTOR pathway, β-catenin pathway and the activation of the STAT family of transcription
factors.
Dasatinib sensitizes KRAS mutant colorectal tumors to cetuximab in vivo
Next we performed a series of mouse xenograft studies to confirm that KRAS wild type
CRC lines are sensitive to cetuximab therapy in vivo. To test the non-specific effects of
cetuximab, we utilized a non-EGFR, KRAS wild type line, Colo320DM (Figure 4A). A total

of 40 mice (20 per group) were analyzed with bilateral flank tumors. Established tumors
(>100 mm3) were randomized and treated twice weekly with 0.3 mg of cetuximab or 0.3 mg
of immunoglobulin G (IgG) for 3 weeks. Next, we utilized a known EGFR-expressing,
cetuximab-sensitive NSCLC line, H226, for a positive control (Figure 4B). A total of 20
mice (10 per group) were analyzed with bilateral flank tumors. Similarly, mice were
randomized to cetuximab or IgG and treated twice weekly once tumors were established
with 0.3 mg of cetuximab or 0.3 mg IgG for 4.5 weeks. The data in Figure 4A and 4B
indicate that the EGFR negative line showed no off-target effects of cetuximab whereas
H226 showed a similar response to cetuximab as has been previously reported (Wheeler et
al., 2008).

Author Manuscript

Next we tested the KRAS wild type lines, SW48 and CaCo2, for response to cetuximab in
vivo (Figure 4C and 4D). For both SW48 and CaCo2, 20 mice per cell line were analyzed
(10 per group) with bilateral flank tumors. Mice were randomized to IgG or cetuximab and
treated twice weekly with 0.3 mg of cetuximab or IgG. SW48 mice were treated for 3.5
weeks whereas the CaCo2 mice were treated for 5.5 weeks based on relative tumor growth
rates. This set of experiments confirmed that these KRAS wild type CRC lines are sensitive
to cetuximab and manifested a response after the first treatment.

In Figure 5 we performed a series of experiments using three KRAS mutant CRC lines
(LS180, LoVo, and HCT116) to test cetuximab and dasatinib as single agents, given
sequentially, or in combination. Athymic nude mice were injected with cells (2×106) and
established tumors from KRAS mutant cell lines were randomized to treatment or control
groups. Each line was treated with cetuximab or dasatinib alone (Figure 5A, 5B, 5C,
cetuximab; upper left panels, dasatinib; upper right panels). For LS180, 37 mice
established tumors and were analyzed with bilateral flank tumors (19 in the vehicle group,
18 in the dasatinib treatment group). For LoVo, 42 mice were analyzed (21 per treatment
group) with bilateral flank tumors. For HCT116, 40 mice (20 per treatment group) were
analyzed with bilateral flank tumors. The results confirmed the clinical finding that these
tested KRAS mutant lines were resistant to cetuximab. Dasatinib monotherapy in HCT116
and LS180 showed minimal tumor growth delay and was not shown to be statistically
significant, whereas treatment of LoVo with dasatinib appeared to have a slight proliferative
effect. These results indicated that dasatinib monotherapy is not effective in these KRAS
mutant CRC cell lines.

Author Manuscript

Next we performed both sequential (cetuximab followed by dasatinib) and combinatorial
treatment regimens (Figure 5A, 5B, 5C, sequential; lower left panels, combination; lower
right panels). In the sequential experiments, mice were randomized to treatment (cetuximab
followed by dasatinib) or control (IgG followed by vehicle) groups. For each line (LS180,
LoVo, and HCT116), 20 mice were analyzed (10 per treatment group) with bilateral flank
tumors. Mice were given cetuximab or IgG (0.3 mg) twice weekly by intraperitoneal
injection until tumors demonstrated a resistant phenotype - defined as growth without
deviation from the IgG controls. At this time, cetuximab and IgG were ceased and dasatinib
or vehicle was started the next day for five days a week by oral gavage (70 mg/kg).
Treatment with dasatinib or vehicle was continued for the specified times. The results of
these experiments indicated that sequential treatment could lead to an anti-tumor growth

effect (Figure 5A, 5B, 5C, lower left panels). The most pronounced effect was in seen in
the LS180 and LoVo sequential experiments.

Author Manuscript

In the combinatorial experiments, mice were randomized to treatment or control groups. For
each line (LS180, LoVo, and HCT116), 30 mice from each line (15 per treatment group)
were analyzed with bilateral flank tumors. Established tumors were treated with either the
combination of IgG and vehicle or cetuximab (0.3mg, twice weekly) and dasatinib
(70mg/kg, 5 times weekly) for the time indicated (Figure 5A, 5B, 5C, lower right panel).
These experiments demonstrated statistically significant tumor growth inhibition in the
combinatorial treatment regimen compared to vehicle controls that was distinguishable after
the first treatment in LS180 and LoVo cell lines (P≤0.001). HCT116 demonstrated a
statistically significant response at the beginning (P<0.05) and by the end of treatment
(P<0.001); although response was modest compared to the other two KRAS mutated cell
lines. Collectively, this series of mice xenograft experiments suggests sequential or
combinatorial treatment regimens of cetuximab and dasatinib may be effective in KRAS
mutant CRC tumors. In addition the combination of cetuximab and dasatinib appears to be
more efficacious than the sequential experiments.
Combinatorial dasatinib and cetuximab treatment decreases proliferation and enhances
apoptosis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To determine the impact of the combination of dasatinib plus cetuximab we examined rates
of cell proliferation and apoptosis in tumor samples from each line. Cell proliferation was
analyzed by immunohistochemistry for Ki67. Each tumor shown Figure 6A was collected 3
hours after the last dasatinib or vehicle treatment and 24 hours after the last cetuximab or
IgG treatment. In each respective line, Ki67 expression is decreased in the treatment samples
(+) compared to vehicle controls (−) (Figure 6A, Ki67 panels). To further analyze the
effects of cetuximab and dasatinib on tumor growth, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferasemediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was completed on tumor samples. Figure
6A TUNEL assay panels demonstrate apoptosis in each KRAS mutant cell line was
increased by the combination treatment (+) compared to vehicle controls (−). Quantification
of the immunohistochemistry staining for Ki67 and TUNEL is shown in Figure 6B.
Concomitant treatment samples were obtained from mice euthanized at 3, 12, and 24 hour
time points after the last dasatinib or vehicle treatment and 24, 27, 36, and 48 hours after the
last cetuximab or IgG treatment. Five random fields, 4 sections for each sample were
analyzed at 400× and compared to control slides for false positive DAB staining. The rates
of Ki67 expression in LoVo and HCT116 demonstrated statistically significant differences
in proliferation between treatment and control groups (66% and 68% decrease in
proliferation, respectively). LS180 demonstrated decrease in proliferation of 27%. All lines
demonstrated a statistically significant increase in percentage of apoptosis compared to
vehicle controls based on TUNEL assays. LS180 demonstrated a 97% increase in apoptosis,
LoVo demonstrated a 93% increase in apoptosis, and HCT116 demonstrated a 71% increase
in apoptosis. Collectively, this series of experiments suggests that the combination of
cetuximab and dasatinib may lead to decreased tumor growth by increasing cell death
(apoptosis) and decreasing cell proliferation (Ki67) in KRAS mutant CRC lines.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Colon cancer continues to be the second most common cancer-related death in the United
States (Jemal et al., 2008). The etiology of mCRC is a complex series of genetic events that
are characterized by several alterations including p53, EGFR and SFK expression and
mutations in KRAS (Fearon and Vogelstein, 1990; Summy and Gallick, 2003). The EGFR
protein is expressed in ~ 85% of mCRC as measured by the specific binding of 125I-EGFR
to tumor plasma membrane preparations, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry
(Normanno et al., 2003). In addition, It is estimated that 30–40% of patients with CRC have
a KRAS mutation (Bardelli and Siena, 2010; Normanno et al., 2009). Further, it has been
demonstrated in several clinical trials that patients with mCRC and a KRAS mutation do not
respond to cetuximab therapy (Benvenuti et al., 2007; Cappuzzo et al., 2008; De Roock et
al., 2008; Di Fiore et al., 2007; Karapetis et al., 2008; Khambata-Ford et al., 2007; Lievre et
al., 2008). These trial results leave a large population of patients with mCRC that cannot
benefit from cetuximab therapy. The data presented herein indicate that dasatinib can
sensitize cetuximab resistant, KRAS mutant CRC tumors to cetuximab. Further, this
combinatorial treatment was marked by downregulation of components of the MAPK, AKT/
mTOR, β-catenin and STAT pathways.

We screened 16 CRC lines for EGFR and SFK expression, and KRAS or BRAF mutations
and dependency on KRAS signaling (Figure 1). Next we determined if these model systems
mimic clinical findings in that KRAS mutant CRC lines would be resistant to cetuximab
therapy. To test this hypothesis we treated all KRAS mutant lines in vitro and challenged
them with increasing concentrations of cetuximab (data not shown). The results of this
indicated that KRAS mutant CRC lines showed a robust response to cetuximab on plastic
plates and did not mimic what is seen in vivo and the clinic. Therefore we performed a series
of cell culture experiments using plastic plates, fibronectin, laminin, fibronectin/laminin or
PDL/laminin coated plates. These experiments indicated that PDL/laminin plates could most
closely mimic clinical findings showing that KRAS mutant CRC lines were resistant to
cetuximab (Figure 2A). This finding suggests that the interaction between the extracellular
matrix in vitro, and most likely in vivo, plays a critical role in KRAS mutant CRC response
to EGFR targeting agents. Viloria-Petit and colleagues reported that cetuximab resistant
lines established in vivo, were sensitive to cetuximab in vitro (with plastic plates) after
establishment of cell lines taken from mouse xenografts (Viloria-Petit et al., 2001).
Collectively these findings underscore the importance of the experimental approach to study
therapeutic targeting KRAS mutant CRC lines and indicate that factors in the cell’s
environment are critical in the treatment of KRAS mutant CRC.

In figure 2B and 2C three KRAS mutant lines were tested for their response to cetuximab,
dasatinib or the combination. Each line was resistant to cetuximab and semi-responsive to
dasatinib. However, the combination of the two molecular targeting agents led to decreased
proliferative potential as compared to either agent alone (Figure 2B). We verified that the
cetuximab and dasatinib could reduce the activity of their respective targets (Figure 2C).
Although, the EGFR couples growth factor signaling to the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway,
and mutations in KRAS uncouple this pathway from the receptor, the EGFR still plays a role
in the activation of other key pathways such as the PI3K/AKT pathway, STATs pathway

and the PLCγ/PKC pathways (Marmor et al., 2004). These pathways may still be activated
by the EGFR, even in the KRAS mutant setting. To determine the effects of co-inhibition of
SFKs and the EGFR we used phospho-array analysis on the three KRAS mutant CRC lines
treated with vehicle, dasatinib, cetuximab or the combination. The results of these
experiments revealed common pathways inhibited by the combination of these two agents in
mutant KRAS CRC lines. Firstly, in LS180 and HCT116 the β-catenin pathway appeared to
be downregulated (Figure 3A and 3C). This was evident by the decrease in phosphorylation
of GSK3α and GSK3β. Decreased activity in this enzyme results in decreased β-catenin
phosphorylation (also noted in the phospho-array), thus allowing it to translocate to the
nucleus and where it binds the Lef/Tcf transcription factors and activating target genes
involved in cancer progression. Secondly, in LS180 and HCT116, downregulation of the
AKT/mTOR/p70S6 Kinase pathway was noted. In both lines activating phosphorylation
events on AKT were decreased. AKT, through a series of complex signal transduction
cascades, leads to the activation of the mTOR1 complex (Engelman, 2009). This serinethreonine kinase then phosphorylates p70 S6 kinase which leads to the increased translation
of mRNAs that encode proteins for cell cycle regulators (MYC and cyclin D1) as well as
ribosomal proteins and elongation factors involved in translation (reviewed in (Rini, 2008)).
Finally, in all three lines tested, the combination of dasatinib and cetuximab resulted in the
downregulation two pathways involved in tumor proliferation: 1) members of the STAT
family and 2) members of the MAPK signaling cascade. The STAT family is comprised of
seven members, STAT1-4, STAT5a, STAT5b and STAT6. Binding of growth factors or
cytokines to their receptors results in intrinsic kinase activity or recruitment of receptorassociated kinases (janus kinase (JAK) and SFKs). These phosphorylated receptors in turn
phosphorylates STATs on key residues leading to their dimerization and translocation to the
nucleus where they regulate genes involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis
and tumor growth. In terms of the MAPK signaling pathway the combination of dasatinib
and cetuximab impacted proteins within this cascade albeit at different levels of the
pathway. At the terminal end of the classical RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK cascade sits two proteins
the 90 kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK1) and MSK1/2. RSKs are phosphorylated at the end
of the classical where ERK phosphorylates RSK1 in the kinase activation loop (Richards et
al., 1999). Activation of RSK1 can lead to the phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein
BAD that, when phosphorylated, abrogate BAD’s pro-apoptotic function (Shimamura et al.,
2000). In addition, RSK1 can phosphorylates IkBa, the inhibitor of NF-kB, inducing its
degradation and allowing its translocation and function in the nucleus (Ghoda et al., 1997).
Decreased RSK1 phosphorylation was noted in LS180 and HCT116. MSK1/2 are believed
to play a pivotal role in the activation of the CREB transcription factor by phosphorylation
of serine 133 (Wiggin et al., 2002). This molecule along with MEK1/2 was down regulated
in LoVo. Collectively these data suggest that therapeutic treatment with dasatinib and
cetuximab results in the downregulation of several critical pathways involved in the
progression of cancer.
Both in vitro and in vivo (Figures 2B and 5C) the HCT116 data demonstrate a statistically
significant response to the combination of cetuximab and dasatinib, but not as robust as
compared to LS180 or LoVo. This may be explained due to the reported PI3 kinase mutation
in HCT116 (Jhawer et al., 2008; Wee et al., 2009), which would lead to enhanced signaling

through the AKT pathway, independent of cetuximab treatment. However, AKT activity, as
measured by phospho-array analysis (Figure 3C) did show decreased AKT activity as
compared to either agent alone. This suggests that other, yet to be identified mechanisms
exist for the decreased response to the combination in the HCT116 cell line.

Dasatinib is an orally bioavailable and promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of
several human malignancies including chronic myelogenous leukemia, non-small cell lung
cancer, small cell lung cancer, advanced breast cancer (including triple negative), pancreatic
cancer, prostate cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (reviewed in (Kim et
al., 2009). Dasatinib was discovered through the synthesis and testing of a series of thiazolebased compounds with activity against SRC and ABL kinases to target imatinib-resistant
BCR-ABL mutants (Kantarjian et al., 2006). Dasatinib, although relatively specific for
ABL, BCR-ABL and the SFKs, it possesses a broad-spectrum of inhibition of kinases
including Kit, PDGFR, EphA receptors and several others (Hantschel et al., 2008). Nonspecific effects must always be considered when developing a mechanism but regardless, the
effect of cetuximab and dasatinib on anti-tumor growth is evident and dasatinib’s broad
spectrum of kinase inhibition may, in part, be linked to its clinical success thus far as well as
in combination with cetuximab in the KRAS mutant CRC setting. The combination of
cetuximab and dasatinib has shown to be effective in other circumstances these include in
the situation of overcoming acquired resistance to cetuximab in NSCLC (Li et al., 2009;
Wheeler et al., 2009). In addition, clinical trials looking at this combination are currently in
recruitment in HNSCC, mCRC and other solid tumors (clinical trials.gov).

KRAS is clearly a marker of resistance to cetuximab in monotherapy for CRC and patient
screening is still essential. However, our results suggest KRAS mutant CRC lines are
dependent on both signals from the EGFR and SFKs. Thus, the relationship between EGFR
and SFK signaling in the presence of KRAS mutations will be an area of intense
investigation. The concomitant treatment of dasatinib and cetuximab may be a viable option
for KRAS mutant CRC patients without PI3K, or further downstream mutations. In addition,
future directions may include investigations of this combination in the KRAS wild type
setting. In summary, this study combines two FDA-approved agents, dasatinib and
cetuximab, in the KRAS mutant CRC setting. From the data provided it appears that
dasatinib can sensitize KRAS mutant tumors to cetuximab. This work may provide rationale
for further investigative clinical trials using dasatinib plus cetuximab in patients with
KRAS-mutant, cetuximab-resistant mCRC.

LS123, LS180, SK-CO-1, SW48, SW480, SW620, SW948, SW1417, and WiDr were
purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). All cell lines were maintained in their respective
media with 10% fetal bovine serum with 1% penicillin and streptomycin, except for CaCo2,
which was maintained in 20% FBS and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Colo320DM,
DLD1, and HCT15 were maintained in RPMI 1640; HCT116 and HT29 were maintained in
McCoy’s media; LoVo was maintained in F12 media; CaCo2, LS123, LS180, SK-CO-1,
and WiDr were maintained in minimum essential medium eagle; SW48, SW480, SW620,
SW948, and SW1417 were maintained in L15 media (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg,
MD). LS180, LoVo and HCT116 cells were seeded in 96-well plates Poly D-lysine/laminin
plates (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and transiently transfected with small interfering
RNAs (SiRNA; siKRAS (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO)) using LipofectAMINE RNAiMAX
according to the manufacture’s instructions (Invitrogen). The Non-targeting siRNA pool was
obtained from Dharmacon. Cells were then lysed for analysis of protein knockdown by
Western blot or use in cell proliferation assays 72 hour after siRNA transfection.
Cell proliferation assay
Exponentially grown cells were seeded in 96-well plates Poly D-lysine/laminin plates (BD
Biosciences). Following 72 hours treatment, 10ul of tetrazolium salt from cell counting kit
(Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Japan) was added to each well. After two to four hours,
the percentage cell growth was calculated by comparison of the A540 reading from treated
versus control wells.
Pyrosequencing

Author Manuscript

Genomic DNA was isolated from cell lines using a standard proteinase K-phenolchloroform extraction method. For polymerase chain reaction amplification of the relevant
fragments, we used PyroMark KRAS and BRAF kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to
the manufacturer’s protocols. The resulting PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.5%
agarose gel to confirm successful amplification and 40 uL of each sample was sequenced
using a Pyrosequensing PSQ96HS System (Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.
Immunoblotting analysis

Author Manuscript

Whole cell protein lysate was obtained with lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM
NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM
PMSF and 10 μg/ml of leupeptin and aprotinin), sonicated, fractionated and quantified.
Cellular fractionation was performed as described previously (Wheeler et al., 2008). Protein
was quantitated using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Western
blotting was performed as described previously (Wheeler et al., 2008). Briefly, equal
amounts of protein were fractionated by SDS–PAGE. Thereafter, proteins were transferred
to PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and analyzed by incubation with the
appropriate primary antibody. Proteins were detected via incubation with HRP-conjugated
secondary antibodies and ECL chemiluminescence detection system (GE Healthcare,

Piscataway, NJ). The antibodies used in this study were as follows: EGFR, HRP-conjugated
goat-anti-rabbit IgG, and goat-anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). pEGFR 1173, SFK, pSFK and β-actin were obtained
from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Ki67 antibody was purchased from AbCam
(Cambridge, MA) and α-tubulin was obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Image J
was used to evaluate densitometry of EGFR and SFK western blots.
Phospho- kinase Array

Author Manuscript

LS180, LoVo and HCT116 cell lines were analyzed the panel of phosphorylation profiles of
kinases after treatment with cetuximab, dasatinib and combination of these compounds
(Human Phospho-Kinase Array, ARY003, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). This array
specifically screens for relative levels of phosphorylation of 39 individual proteins involved
in cellular proliferation and survival. After treatment with cetuximab, dasatinib and
combination of cetuximab and dasatinib, cell lysates were incubated with the membrane.
Thereafter, a cocktail of biotinylated detection antibodies, streptavidin-HRP and
chemiluminescent detection reagents were used to detect the phosphorylated protein. The
relative expression of specific photophorylated protein was determined following
quantification of scanned images by ImageJ compared to cetuximab, dasatinib, combination
of cetuximab plus dasatinib and untreated control.
Mouse xenograft model

Author Manuscript

Athymic nude mice (4 to 6-week-old males) were obtained from the Harlan laboratories
(Indianapolis, IN). All animal procedures and maintenance were conducted in accordance
with the institutional guidelines of the University of Wisconsin. Mice were randomized into
treatment or control groups. Mice were injected in bilaterally in the dorsal flank of the
mouse at respective day 0 (2×106 cells). Once tumors reached 100–200 mm3, mice were
started on their respective treatments (cetuximab, IgG, dasatinib, vehicle, the combination of
cetuximab and dasatinib, or the combination of IgG and vehicle). Cetuximab dose for all
experiments was 0.3 mg intraperitoneally twice weekly. The dose for all experiments was 70
mg/kg of dasatinib five days a week by oral gavage. Tumor volume measurements were
evaluated by digital calipers and calculated by the formula (π)/6 × (large diameter) × (small
diameter)2.
Mouse tumor collection and protein isolation

Author Manuscript

Tumors were collected at 0, 3, 12, and 24 hours post-treatment. Mice were sedated using
isofluorane mixed with oxygen until unconscious. Mice were euthanized by cervical
dislocation and tumors were promptly collected, washed in PBS, and frozen on dry ice or
fixed in formaldehyde. Tumors were crushed using a mortar and pestle until the tumor was
the consistency of a powder. Whole cell protein lysate was obtained with lysis buffer (50
mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM
EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF and 10 μg/ml of leupeptin and aprotinin), sonicated, and
quantified. Cellular fractionation and protein quantitation were performed as stated above.

Ki67 and TUNEL Assays

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The ApopTag Plus Peroxidase in situ apoptosis detection kit was purchased from Millipore.
Samples were prepared according to manufacturer’s recommended protocol with the
modification of antigen retrieval instead of proteinase K. Antigen retrieval was performed in
citrate buffer (pH=6.0) with 0.05% tween 20. For immuohistochemistry, tumor samples
were fixed in paraformaldehyde for 24 hours, paraffin embedded, and serially cut onto
slides. Samples were deparaffinized and antigen retrieval was performed in citrate buffer
(pH=6.0) with 0.05% tween 20. Samples were then incubated with Ki67 primary antibody
(AbCam, Cambridge, MA). Samples were washed and incubated in secondary antibody one
hour followed by with Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).
DAB staining was done using Ultravision Plus Detection System (Lab Vision Corporation,
Fremont, CA). Images were captured using Biospot Advanced program software. ImageJ
was used to obtain total number of cells (via thresholding that was maintained across all
samples). Color deconvolution was used to identify the positive staining and was
thresholded across all image samples. All images for treatment (cetuximab plus dasatinib)
and control (IgG plus vehicle) were averaged and standard error mean was calculated. Ki67
samples were normalized to the vehicle images and TUNEL samples were normalized to the
treatment (cetuximab plus dasatinib) images.
Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

Student T-test was used to determine the significance of the cell proliferation or tumor
growth volumes between treatment and control groups for each in vitro and in vivo
experiment respectively. Statistical analysis to compare treatment and control groups in
positive immunohistochemistry staining was also done with a t-test. Differences between
clones were considered statistically significant if P ≤ 0.05.

Figure 1. Characterization of colorectal tumor lines

Author Manuscript

A) Analysis of EGFR and SFK expression in colon cancer lines. CRC tumor lines were
grown and whole cell lysates were obtained, fractionated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted
for the indicated proteins. α-tubulin was used as a loading control. All sixteen-tumor lines
were tested for in vivo tumor growth using mouse xenografts. Tumor lines that grew greater
than 500mm3 in vivo are denoted by *. Densitometry measurements of EGFR and SFK
relative to Colo320DM (1.0) for EGFR and SW48 (1.0) for SFK are shown. B) KRAS and
BRAF mutational status was determined via pyrosequencing. C) KRAS mutant lines LS180,
LoVo and HCT116 are dependent on KRAS. KRAS mutant lines LS180, LoVo and
HCT116 were treated with transfection reagent only, scramble siRNA (10nM), or KRAS
siRNA (10nM). Proliferation was measured at 72 hours after treatment using the
proliferation assay as described in the experimental procedures and plotted as a percentage
of growth relative to the untreated control cells. Data points are represented as mean ± SEM
(n = 4). *p < 0.05. Inset denotes confirmation of KRAS knockdown.

(A) KRAS mutant colorectal lines are resistant to cetuximab when compared to KRAS wild
type lines. Two KRAS wild type lines (CaCo2 and SW48) and three KRAS mutant lines
(LS180, LoVo and HCT116) were tested for response to cetuximab. Cells were plated on
Poly D-lysine/laminin 96 well plates, allowed to adhere overnight and treated with vehicle
(PBS) or 160 nM of cetuximab for 72 hours. B) Dasatinib sensitizes KRAS mutant lines
LS180, LoVo and HCT116 to cetuximab. Cells were plated on Poly D-lysine/laminin 96
well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were treated with vehicle (PBS), 500 nM
of cetuximab, 50 nM dasatinib or the combination (CTX + DSB) for 72 hours. Proliferation
was measured at 72 hours after drug treatment using the proliferation assay as described in
the experimental procedures and plotted as a percentage of growth relative to the untreated
control cells. Data points are represented as mean ± SEM (n = 7). *p < 0.05.

A) AKT/mTOR/p70 S6 kinase pathway (AKT and p70 S6 Kinase), MAPK/RSK
(RSK1/2/3), components of the β-catenin pathway (GSK α/β and β-catenin) and STAT
family members were downregulated by the combination of dasatinib and cetuximab in
LS180 cells. B) Members of the MAPK signaling pathway were downregulated with the
combination of dasatinib and cetuximab in LoVo cells. C) AKT/mTOR/p70 S6 kinase
pathway (AKT and p70 S6 Kinase), MAPK/RSK (RSK1/2/3), components of the β-catenin
pathway (GSK α/β and β-catenin) and STAT family members were downregulated by the
combination of dasatinib and cetuximab in HCT116 cells. After treatment with cetuximab,
dasatinib and combination of cetuximab and dasatinib, cells were collected and cell extracts
were incubated with membrane containing antibodies to 39 individual proteins. The
membranes were washed and incubated with a cocktail of biotinylated detection antibodies,
streptavidin-HRP and chemiluminescent detection reagents to measure the levels of
phosphorylated protein. Quantitation of phosphorylated protein was completed using
scanned images from ImageJ software. Data points are represented as mean of duplicate.

Dasatinib response was tested by inoculating mice with a KRAS mutant line and
randomizing to dasatinib or vehicle treatment. LS180 mice received 2.5 weeks of treatment.
LoVo mice received 3 weeks of treatment. HCT116 mice received 4.5 weeks of treatment.
(A, B, C lower left panel) Sequential treatment response of cetuximab then dasatinib was
tested by inoculating mice with a KRAS mutant line and randomizing to cetuximab followed
by dasatinib or IgG followed by vehicle. Cetuximab was ceased and dasatinib was started
the next day once tumors displayed resistance. LS180 mice received one week of
cetuximab/IgG and 2.5 weeks of dasatinib/vehicle. LoVo mice received 3 weeks of
cetuximab/IgG and 2.5 weeks of dasatinib/vehicle. HCT116 mice received 2 weeks of
cetuximab/IgG and 2.5 weeks of dasatinib/vehicle. (A, B, C lower right panel)
Concomitant treatment response of cetuximab and dasatinib was tested by inoculating mice
with a KRAS mutant line and randomizing to cetuximab plus dasatinib or IgG plus vehicle.
LS180 mice received 2.5 weeks of concomitant treatment. LoVo mice received 3.5 weeks of
concomitant treatment. HCT116 mice received 4 weeks of concomitant treatment.
