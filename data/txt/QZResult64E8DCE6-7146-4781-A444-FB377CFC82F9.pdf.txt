ABSTRACT
The molecularly targeted agents, including anti-VEGF or anti-EGFR monoclonal
antibody and some inhibitors of EGFR tyrosine kinase, are effective in the treatment
of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to a certain extent, but the benefit for a
proportion of patients is still limited. Hence, it is necessary and urgent to develop more
selective and effective molecular targeted agents against lung cancer. Here, we have
synthesized novel theanine derivatives, methyl coumarin-3-carboxylyl L-theanine
(TMC), ethyl coumarin-3-carboxylyl L-theanine (TEC), ethyl 6-fluorocoumarin3-carboxylyl L-theanine (TFC), and ethyl 6-nitrocoumarin-3-carboxylyl L-theanine
(TNC), which are fluorescent small molecules, based on their parental compound
theanine and studied their anticancer activities in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models
of human and mouse cancers. Our results show that the four theanine derivatives
significantly inhibit the lung cancer cell migration and the growth of lung cancer
and leukemia cell lines. TFC and TNC display enhanced effects with anticancer drugs
cytarabine, vincristine, and methotrexate on inhibition of lung cancer cell growth
and no toxicity to the normal human embryonic lung fibroblast and peripheral blood
lymphocytes. TFC and TNC exhibit strong suppression of the highly metastatic Lewis
lung cancer (LLC) and A549 tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice without toxicity to

mice. TFC and TNC can effectively suppress the growth of lung cancer cells in vitro, ex
vivo and in vivo by targeting EGFR/VEGFR-Akt/NF-κB pathways. Our study has suggested
that TFC and TNC may have the therapeutic and/or adjuvant therapeutic applications in
the treatment of lung cancers and other cancer.

INTRODUCTION

RESULTS

Lung adenocarcinoma is the leading cause of
cancer-related deaths in the world, and non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) accounts for nearly 80% of the cases [14]. Despite recent advances in diagnosis and treatment,
the overall 5-year survival rate of lung cancer patients is
only about 15%. The patients with advanced lung cancer
have a median survival of approximately 10 months when
treated with standard platinum-based therapy. Several
newly developed cytotoxic agents including paclitaxel,
vinorelbine, irinotecan, and gemcitabine have shown
to offer multiple therapeutic choices for patients with
advanced NSCLC; however, each of the new regimens can
provide only modest improvements in survival and quality
of life compared with traditional cisplatin-based therapies
[5]. Recently, molecular targeted agents, including antiEGFR or anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, cetuximab
or bevacizumab, and small molecule inhibitors of EGFR
tyrosine kinase, such as erlotinib and gefitinib, have been
investigated in clinical trials and/or were approved for
clinical use. These agents are effective in the treatment of
advanced NSCLC to a certain extent, but a proportion of
patients who could receive a survival benefit is still limited
[6-7]. Hence, there is an urgent need for more effective
therapies and/or molecular targeted anticancer agents for
treating patients with lung cancer.
Theanine (γ–glutamylethylamide) is a characteristic
amino acid found in tea and has been widely used as a
safe food additive without limitation to its dose. Reports
from different laboratories including our own showed
that theanine possesses anticancer activities against
some cancers [8-11]. For instance, our previous study
showed that theanine and the sera from theanine-fed rats
inhibited the invasion of rat hepatoma cells in vitro and ex
vivo [10] and the hepatoma growth as well as metastasis
in vivo [11]. To develop more effective and lower toxic
anticancer agents, here we have synthesized novel
theanine derivatives based on the structure of theanine and
investigated the effects of these small molecule fluorescent
compounds on cancer cell migration, growth, apoptosis,
and tumor growth as well as the related receptors-mediated
signaling pathways in highly metastatic lung cancer.

The synthesized theanine derivatives inhibited
lung cancer cell migration and growth of lung
cancer and leukemia cells, and induced lung
cancer cell apoptosis as well as suppressed the
growth of lung cancer stem cells
In this study, we synthesized four novel theanine
derivatives which are small molecule fluorescent
compounds, methyl coumarin-3-carboxylyl L-theanine
(MCCT, short for TMC/3a), ethyl coumarin-3carboxylyl L-theanine (ECCT, short for TEC/3b), ethyl
6-fluorocoumarin-3-carboxylyl L-theanine (EFCT, short
for TFC/3c), and ethyl 6-nitrocoumarin-3-carboxylyl
L-theanine (ENCT, short for TNC/3d), based on their
parental compound theanine targeting the migration
and growth of cancer cells. The scheme of theanine
derivatives (3a/TMC, 3b/TEC, 3c/TFC, 3d/TNC)
synthesis and chemical structures are shown in Fig. 1A.
The numbers of application for national patents in China
and for an international patent are 201210363367.0,
201210363378.9, 201210515826.2, 201210515827.7, and
PCT/CN2013/084146, respectively. In previous studies,
including our own, theanine displayed some anticancer
activities [8-11]. Because the high water solubility of
theanine and the structure of coumarin-3-carboxylic acid
could limit the antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo, we
synthesized the theanine derivatives, 3a/TMC, 3b/TEC,
3c/TFC, and 3d/TNC by esterification of the carboxyl
group of theanine with ethanol and acylation of the
amino group of theanine with 6-substituted coumarin3-carboxylic acid. We hypothesized and confirmed that
3a/TMC, 3b/TEC, 3c/TFC, and 3d/TNC would greatly
enhance the anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo.
We first tested the effects of 3a/TMC, 3b/TEC, 3c/
TFC, and 3d/TNC on tumor cell migration. Our results
showed that TMC, TEC, TFC and TNC (0.004 to 0.016
mM) significantly suppressed the migration of highly
metastatic Lewis lung cancer (LLC) and A549 cells in
a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). The ratios of lung
cancer cell migration were reduced by 18%, 20%, 25%,
and 35% in LLC cells, and by 19%, 21%, 40%, and 44%
in A549 cells, respectively in response to the treatment
of 0.016 mM of TMC, TEC, TFC and TNC, although 24
h treatment with TMC, TEC, TFC and TNC at the same
concentration did not significantly affect the growth of
both LLC and A549 cells (data not shown).

We next tested the effects of TMC, TEC, TFC
and TNC on the growth in cancer cell lines. The result
indicated that 48 h and 72 h treatment with TMC, TEC,
TFC and TNC significantly suppressed the growth in the
lung cancer and leukemia cells. Their IC50 values (72 h
treatment) of growth inhibition are 0.158, 0.148, 0.125,
and 0.09 mM for LLC cells, 0.196, 0.179, 0.99, and 0.064

mM for A549 cells, 0.147, 0.102, 0.079, and 0.076 mM
for H460 cells, and 0.223, 0.127, 0.096, and 0.078 mM
for K562 cells, respectively (Fig 2A). Then, we focused
on studying the effects of TNC and TFC on the growth
of LLC and A549 cells, based on the results of the IC50
values and migration inhibition by the four theanine
derivatives. Both of TNC and TFC at the concentrations

TMC, 3b/TEC, 3c/TFC and 3d/TNC were prepared as outlined in the scheme. L-Theanine treated with SOCl2 in ethanol to generate its
methyl ester (1a) or ethyl ester (1b), respectively. The amino group of ester 1a or 1b was acylated with coumarin-3-carboxylic acid (2a),
6-fluorocoumarin-3- carboxylic acid (2b) or 6-nitrocoumarin-3-carboxylic acid (2c) under classical peptide coupling condition to afford the
target derivatives 3a−3d. The 3a−3d were purified by column chromatography and the structure was characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR
and MS. (B) Inhibitory effects of 3a (TMC), 3b (TEC), 3c (TNC) and 3d (TFC) on migration in lung cancer cell lines. The effects of 3a-3d
on the migration of LLC and A549 cells were examined by the migration assay as described in the section of “Materials and methods”. The

of 0.016 to 0.25 mM significantly inhibited the growth of
lung cancer LLC and A549 cell lines in dose- and timedependent manners (Fig. 2B). Moreover, TNC and TFC
at the same concentrations of 0.016 to 0.25 mM had little
effect on the growth of the normal human embryonic
lung fibroblast MRC-5 and human peripheral blood

lymphocytes (PBL) (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the inhibitors of
PI3K/Akt (Ly294002, 0.016 mM) and NF-κB (Bay, 0.0032
mM), used as positive controls, significantly inhibited the
growth of not only lung cancer cell lines but also normal
MRC-5 cells (Fig. 2B, 2C).
We previously reported that theanine displayed

TEC, TFC and TNC showed growth inhibition of lung cancer LLC, A549 and H460 cell lines as well as leukemia K562 cell line with
the indicated IC50 values (72h treatment). (B) TFC and TNC significantly inhibited the growth of LLC and A549 cells in dose- and timedependent manners. (C) TFC and TNC showed no significant effect on growth of normal human embryonic lung fibroblast MRC-5 and

of A549 cells in combination with anticancer drugs cytarabine (10-25 nM), vincristine (50-100 µM), and methotrexate (10-25 nM) (72h
treatment). The cells were treated for 48 h and/or 72 h with the indicated concentrations of TFC or TNC (TFC 16–TNC 250/0.016–0.25
mM), Ly (0.016 mM), and Bay (0.0032 mM). The cells in control group were treated with DMSO vehicle. The rate of relative cell growth
was determined by the MTT assay. Ly294002 (Ly) and Bay are the inhibitors of PI3K/Akt and NF-κB, respectively. The data are presented
as the mean ± SD (Bar) (n=6). (F) TFC and TNC showed the in vitro (left; 8 mg/ml) and in vivo (right) fluorescent signals in mice (3 h

performed. Values with different letters (a–h; a, a1, a2, a3 – d, d1, d2, d3) differ significantly (P < 0.05).

significant inhibition of cancer cell growth at 1 h and
the inhibitory peak of cancer cell growth at 1 h after its
oral administration in rats [10]. In contrast, our present
data show that the synthesized theanine derivatives TNC
and TFC exhibits the significant inhibition of cancer cell
growth for 8 h and the inhibitory peak of cancer cell

growth at 5 h after their oral administration in rats (Fig.
2D). More importantly, TNC and TFC can significantly
enhance the suppression of A549 cell growth in
combination with anticancer drugs cytarabine, vincristine,
and methotrexate (Fig. 1E). In addition, TNC and TFC
show the very strong in vitro and in vivo fluorescence

characteristics. As shown in Fig. 2F, TNC and TFC display
strong fluorescent signaling in vitro and fluorescent
distribution of TNC and TFC can be observed in mouse
tissues 3 h after their introperitoneal injection.
In order to determine the mechanisms of growth
inhibition by TNC and TFC in LLC and A549 cells, we
analyzed their effects on the cell apoptosis using FACS
by Annexin V-FITC/PI double- staining assay. The results
indicated that TNC and TFC at 0.25 mM displayed evident
induction of apoptosis in LLC and A549 cells after the
cells were treated for 24 h. In response to the treatment
of TNC and TFC at 0.25 mM, the apoptotic ratios were
7.5% and 6.5% in LLC cells, and 15.6% and 11.9% in
A549 cells, respectively (Fig. 3A, 3B). In addition, a
caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (Z, 12.5 µM) reduced
most apoptosis in TNC- and TFC-treated LLC and A549
cells (Fig. 3A, 3B) although an autophagic inhibitor
3-methyladenine (3M, 12.5 µg/ml) partially reduced the
apoptosis in the TNC- and TFC-treated LLC and A549
cells. The induction of apoptosis in LLC and A549 cells
by TNC and TFC could greatly contribute to the growth
inhibition in the lung cancer cells (Fig. 2A, 2B). Moreover,
TNC and TFC at the concentrations of 0.016 to 0.25 mM
significantly inhibited the growth of lung cancer stem cells
after 4-day treatment (Fig.3C).

In order to clarify the receptors regulated in TFCand TNC-treated LLC cells, we studied the effects of
TFC and TNC on the related receptor phosphorylation
and expressions in LLC cells. Our results show that TFC
and TNC at the concentrations of 0.016 to 0.25 mM
remarkably reduced the expressions of VEGFR1 (Fig.
5B) and VEGFR2 (Fig. 5C), and the phosphorylation and
expressions of EGFR (Fig. 5D) and Akt (Fig. 5E) in LLC
cells. Moreover, TFC and TNC greatly reduced NF-κB
protein expression (Fig. 5F) in LLC cells. TNC showed
much stronger activity than TFC on the regulation of the
protein expressions of VEGFR1, pAkt and Akt in LLC
cells.

TFC and TNC suppressed TNFα- and EGF+HGFenhanced growth and/or NF-κB signaling in A549
cells
In order to approve that down-regulation of NF-κB
activity is essential for TFC and TNC’s anticancer effect,
we tested effects of TFC and TNC on the growth and NFκB protein expression and DNA-NF-κB binding activity
in A549 cells stimulated with TNFα and EGF+HGF. We
confirmed that TFC and TNC at 0.25 mM significantly
suppressed TNFα- (20 ng/ml) and EGF+HGF- (100 ng/ml)
enhanced growth in A549 cells after 24 h treatment (Fig.
6A). Moreover, TFC and TNC at 0.25 mM remarkably
reduced TNFα-enhanced DNA-NF-κB binding activity in
A549 cells (Fig.6B). In addition, TFC and TNC at 0.25
mM significantly decreased the EGF+HGF-enhanced NFκB protein expression in A549 cells (Fig.6C).

TFC and TNC down-regulated the protein levels
of Bcl-2 and cyclin D1 and up-regulated the
protein levels of Bax, cytosolic cytochrome c,
caspase-3, PARP-1, p53, and p21 in LLC cells
To understand the molecular mechanisms by which
TFC and TNC inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in
lung cancer cells, we studied the effects of TFC and TNC
on the expressions of proteins related to cell growth and
apoptosis as well as cell cycle arrest in LLC cells. Our
results showed that TFC and TNC markedly reduced the
Bcl-2 protein levels in LLC cells at the concentrations of
0.016 to 0.25 mM (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, TFC and TNC
remarkably up-regulated the expression levels of Bax
(Fig. 4A), cytosolic cytochrome c (Fig. 4B), caspase-3
(Fig. 4C), the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1
(PARP-1) (Fig. 4D), p53 (Fig. 4E), and p21 WAF1 (Fig.
4F) in LLC cells. In addition, TFC and TNC greatly
reduced the protein expression levels of cyclin D1 (Fig.
5A) in LLC cells. TNC showed much stronger activity
than TFC on the regulation of the protein expressions of
Bcl-2/Bax ratio, PARP-1, p53, and cyclin D1 in LLC cells.

TFC and TNC suppressed tumor growth in
tumor-bearing mice
The animal experimental results showed that TFC
and TNC induced time-dependent inhibition of tumor
growth in the highly metastatic LLC and A549 tumorbearing mice. The relative inhibitory rates of tumor
volumes (Fig. 6D, 6E) and weights (Fig. 6F) in LLC
decreased by 50.2% and 43.0% (for TFC treatment), and
60.5% and 61.4% (for TNC treatment), respectively after
treatment with TFC and TNC for 15 days in LLC tumorbearing mice. In the case of A549 tumor-bearing mice, the
relative inhibitory rates of tumor volumes (Fig. 6G, 6H)
and weights (Fig. 6I) were reduced by 65.0% and 57.3%
(for TFC treatment), and 68.2% and 58.8% (for TNC
treatment), respectively after treatment with TFC and TNC
for 28 days. As the positive controls, the anticancer drugs

of the tumor growth of LLC (Fig. 6D, 6E, 6F) and A549

In addition, TFC and TNC showed no evidence of toxicity
to the mice as measured by body weights and the lack of

observed the up-regulation of tumor suppressor p53 (Fig.
4E) and endogenous cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21
WAF1/CIP1 (Fig. 4F) in LLC cells treated with TFC and
TNC. Moreover, our results also indicated that TFC and
TNC significantly down-regulated the cyclin D1 protein
expression in LLC cells (Fig. 5A). Taken together, these
results showed that TFC and TNC significantly suppressed
the growth of LLC cells and remarkably induced the
apoptosis by reducing Bcl-2/Bax ratio, activating the
mitochondrial and caspase-3 pathways, and enhancing
p53 and p21 WAF1 protein levels as well as decreasing
the protein level of cyclin D1, the cell cycle regulator in
LLC cells.
The activated receptors such as VEGFR1,
VEGFR2, and EGFR play very important roles in the
migration and proliferation of cancer cells including
lung cancer cells [14-20]. The down-regulation of the
receptor phosphorylation and/or protein expressions
in LLC cells (Fig. 5B, 5C, 5D) by TFC and TNC could
greatly contribute to the suppression of their downstream
targets and the receptor-mediated signaling pathways,
and thus would lead to the inhibition of the migration
and growth in the lung cancer cells. In order to further
confirm the inhibitory effects of TFC and TNC on the
signaling pathways related to the migration and growth
of the lung cancer cells, we investigated the effects of
TFC and TNC on the suppression of the phosphorylation
and/or expressions of Akt and NF-κB in LLC cells. Our
results indicated that TFC and TNC significantly reduced
the phosphorylation and expression of Akt (Fig. 5E)
and the NF-κB (p65) expression (Fig. 5F) in LLC cells.
In addition, the inhibitors of PI3K/Akt (Ly) and NFκB (Bay) displayed the significant suppression of the
phosphorylation and protein expression of Akt and the NFκB (p65) expression in LLC cells,respectively (Fig. 5E,
5F). Akt is a cytosolic signal transduction protein kinase
that plays an important role in cell survival pathways
[21]. Induction of Akt activity is primarily dependent on
the PI3K pathway. Akt can be activated by many forms
of cellular stress, such as those observed under treatment
with anticancer agents [21]. Once activation, Akt
controls cellular functions such as cell cycle, apoptosis,
gene transcription, and protein synthesis through the
phosphorylation of downstream substrates such as NFκB [21]. NF-κB is a nuclear transcription regulator with a
specific motif for Bcl-2 transcription [22-24]. Activation
of p-Akt and the NF-κB/Bcl-2 pathway leads to inhibition
of chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, which results in
treatment resistance [22]. Our previous results confirmed
that suppression of Akt and the NF-κB/Bcl-2 pathway by
anticancer agents inhibited the migration and growth as
well as induced the apoptosis in human breast and lung
cancer cells [19-20; 23; 30]. Here, we demonstrated
that TFC and TNC significantly suppressed TNFα- and
EGF+HGF-enhanced growth and/or NF-κB signaling
in A549 cells. Our present study indicated that TFC and

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we have synthesized the four
theanine derivatives TMC, TEC, TFC and TNC, and
confirmed that both TFC and TNC have the very strong
in vitro and in vivo fluorescence characteristics (Fig. 2F).
We have demonstrated that TMC, TEC, TFC and TNC
can significantly inhibit the migration (Fig. 1B) of LLC
and A549 cells, and the growth (Fig. 2) of LLC, A549,
H460 and K562 cells. We have also indicated that TFC
and TNC can repress the ex vivo growth of A549 cells
(Fig. 2D) and induce apoptosis in LLC and A549 cell lines
as well as inhibit lung CSCs in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 3). In addition, we have shown that TFC and TNC
can significantly enhance the effects in combination with
anticancer drugs cytarabine, vincristine, and methotrexate
on suppression of A549 cell growth (Fig. 2E). In order
to understand the molecular mechanisms of action, we
further examined the protein expressions related to the
migration, growth, apoptosis in the highly metastatic LLC
cells.
One of the main regulatory steps of apoptotic
cell death is controlled by the ratio of antiapoptotic and
proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins,
which determines the susceptibility to apoptosis. Bax,
a proapoptotic factor of the Bcl-2 family, is found in
monomeric form in the cytosol or is loosely attached
to the membranes under normal conditions. Following
a cell death stimulus, cytosolic and monomeric Bax
translocates to the mitochondria where it becomes
an integral membrane protein and cross-linkable as a
homodimer allowing for the release of factors, such as
cytochrome c, from the mitochondria to propagate the
apoptotic pathway [12-13]. Here, we observed that TFC
and TNC significantly down-regulated the antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 level and up-regulated the proapoptotic Bax
level, leading to reduction of Bcl-2/Bax ratio (Fig. 4A).
Furthermore, TFC and TNC significantly enhanced the
release of cytocrome c from the mitochondria (Fig. 4B)
and subsequently increased the caspase-3 activity (Fig.
4C). Caspase-3 is synthesized as a 35-kDa inactive
precursor (procaspase-3), which is proteolytically cleaved
to produce a mature enzyme composed of 17-kDa
fragments. As shown in Figure 4C and 4D, the protein
levels of caspase-3 in cleaved form and cleaved PARP-1,
the substrate of caspase-3 were enhanced with the increase
in the concentrations of TFC and TNC. In addition, we

TNC significantly inhibited the migration and growth,
and induced apoptosis in the lung cancer cells as well as
suppressed the PI3K/Akt and NF-κB pathway by reducing
the phosphorylation and expression of Akt and the NF-κB
expression and DNA-binding activity, and activating the
apoptotic pathway of Bcl-2/Bax-mitochondrial- caspase-3
in the lung cancer cells.
EGFR, VEGFR, Akt, and NF-kB have become the
important targets against a variety of cancer including
lung cancer cells [14-20; 23; 30]. We have demonstrated
that TFC and TNC significantly inhibited their
phosphorylation and/or expressions and their downstream
targets. Suppression of these receptors-activated Akt-NFκB signaling pathways by TFC and TNC could greatly
contribute to the inhibition of the migration and growth of
lung cancer LLC and A549 cells as well as the LLC and
A549 tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice as we observed
in the present study.
In summary, we have shown that the synthesized
novel small molecule fluorescent compounds TMC, TEC,
TFC and TNC have very strong activities against cancer.
Our results have demonstrated that TMC, TEC, TFC and
TNC not only inhibit the growth of human H460 and K562
cancer cell lines, but also significantly suppresses the LLC
and A549 cell migration and growth. TFC and TNC can
induce the LLC and A549 cell apoptosis and inhibit lung
CSCs growth. We have also shown that TFC and TNC can
suppress the VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and EGFR receptorsmediated signaling pathways of Akt-NF-κB in LLC cells.
TFC and TNC do not inhibit the growth of the normal
human embryonic lung fibroblast MRC-5 and human
peripheral blood lymphocytes. TFC and TNC also do not
display any toxicity to the mice, although both of them
have the strong suppression of the lung tumor growth in
the LLC and A549 tumor-bearing mice. In addition, TFC
and TNC significantly enhance the inhibition of cancer
cell growth when combined with conventional anticancer
drugs. All these findings suggest that TFC and TNC as
novel anticancer compounds may have the therapeutic
and/or adjuvant therapeutic applications in the treatment
of lung cancer and other cancers.

DEBO Biotechnology Polytron Technologies Inc. (Jina,
Shandong, China). The cell lines of A549, H460, LLC,
MRC-5, and K562 as well as PBL were cultured in
DMEM and RPMI 1640 medium (for K562 and PBL
only), respectively, containing 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (FBS), glutamine (2 mM), penicillin
(100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37ºC in a
humidified incubator with 95% air/5% CO2 atmosphere.
The rate of cell growth was determined using MTT assay
or Trypan blue exclusion test (TBET) according to our
published methods [19-20; 23]. Cells were seeded in 96well plates (Becton Dickinson, NJ, U.S.A.) at 2x103 per
well (1x105 per well in the case of PBL) and incubated
overnight to allow attachment. The cells in control group
were treated with DMSO [0.1% (v/v), final concentration].
The cells were incubated in DMEM or RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with 10% FBS containing different
concentrations of TMC, TEC, TFC or TNC (0.016 to 0.25
mM), or Ly294002 (Ly, 0.016 mM), Bay (0.0032 mM),
or in combination of existing anticancer drugs cytarabine
(10-25 nM), vincristine (50-100 µM), and methotrexate
(10-25 nM), or 10% rat sera (in the case of ex vivo assay)
obtained at different time points after TFC and TNC was
orally intubated the rats. Ly and Bay are the inhibitors of
PI3K/Akt, and NF-κB, respectively. After 48 and 72 h of
treatment, the absorbance values in each test group were
measured using MTT assay. For the test of cancer stem
cells (CSCs), the CSCs were isolated from human
lung A549 cells and identified by FACS for the protein
expressions of positive CD133 and other cancer stem cell
surface markers as well as the spheres-forming capacity
and other CSCs characteristics. The CSCs at 0.6x104 per
well at 96-well were treated with TFC and TNC at the
concentrations of 16 to 250 µM. After 4-day treatment, the
absorbance values in each test group were measured using
MTT assay. The relative cell growth was calculated based
on the absorbance of sample vs. the absorbance of control
(vehicle). Experiments were performed in triplicate. In the
case of TNFα- or EGF plus HGF-treated cells, A549 cells
at 3x105 per well at 6-well were treated with TFC and TNC
for 30 minutes. Then the cells were treated with TNF-α(20
ng/ml) and EGF (100 ng/ml) plus HGF (100 ng/ml) for 24
h, respectively. The collected cells were analyzed for the
viability and protein expressions by TBET and Western
Blotting, respectively. Each experiment was performed in
triplicate and repeated at least three times.

Detection of in vitro and in vivo fluorescent signals
We injected TFC, TNC (80 mg/kg, i.p.) or DMSO
as a control into C57/BL6 mice. Three hours later, the
fluorescent imaging in vivo and in vitro (TFC or TNC at
8 mg/ml in a tube) was recorded under 530 nanometer
excitation and 600 nanometer emission. We obtained
images on a Kodak Image Station 4000 Multi-Modal
Imaging System (IS4000MM) equipped with an X-ray
unit and on a Kodak Image Station 2000 (Carestream
Health, Rochester, NY, USA.).

Preparation of sera from TFC- and TNC-fed rats
These were done according to our published
methods with slight modifications [10; 19] Briefly, SD
rats (age range, 6 week; from Tumor Research Institute,
Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China) were
treated in accordance with guidelines established by the
Animal Care and Use Committee at Yantai University
(ACUC) and were approved by the ACUC at Yantai
University, China. TFC or TNC were orally administered
to the rats once daily at a dose of 80 mg/ml/kg body
weight. The blood was then collected at 0, 1, 3, 5, and 8
h from the rats (fasted for 16 h) after oral intubation of
TFC or TNC. The collected blood was left to clot for 2 h
at room temperature and centrifuged twice at 3000x g at
4ºC for 20 minutes. The sera were sterilized by filtration
and then heated at 56 ºC for 30 minutes. The prepared sera
were allocated, and stored at -80°C until ex vivo growth
assay.

(10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1
mM DTT, 0.5 mM phenylmethysulfonylfluoride (PMSF),
1 µg/mL leupeptin, 5 µg/mL aprotinin). Following the
addition of 25 µL 10% NP40, the suspension was vortexed
and centrifuged at 14,500 rpm for 1 min at 4°C; the
supernatant was designated as the cytoplasmic fraction.
Nuclei were resuspended in 50 µL of ice-cold buffer B
(20 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1
mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 25% glycerol, 1 µg/mL leupeptin,
5 µg/mL aprotinin) and centrifuged at 14,500 rpm for 5
min. The supernatant was used as the nuclear fraction
and protein concentration determined by the Bradford
method. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was
done with 10-µg nuclear protein using the Biotin 3´ End
DNA Labeling Kit (Pierce, Rockford, Product # 89818)
and Biotinlabeled NF-κB consensus oligonucleotide (5′AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′). Nuclear
protein-DNA complexes were separated by 4% PAGE.
Transferred DNAs were UV cross-linked to the membrane
and detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
streptavidin (LightShiftTM chemiluminescent EMSA kit,
Pierce, Rockford, Product # 20148) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Migration assay
Tumor cell migration was measured by examining
that the amount of cells pass through a fibronectin-coated
polycarbonate filter, using modified transwell chambers
as described previously [19-20; 29]. In brief, cells (5 x
104) were seeded onto the upper chamber in 200 µL of
serum-free medium containing different concentrations of
TMC, TEC, TFC or TNC (0.004 to 0.016 mM); the lower
compartment was filled with 0.66 mL of DMEM media
supplemented with 10% of FBS (as a chemoattractant).
The cells in control group were treated with DMSO (0.1%,
final concentration). After incubation for 6 h at 37°C, the
cells that migrated to the lower surface of the filter were
fixed and stained using propidium iodide. The cells on
the upper side of the filter were removed using a rubber
scraper. The migrated cells on the underside of the filter
were counted and recorded for images under a fluorescent
microscope (Nikon, TE2000-U, Japan). Experiments were
performed in triplicate.

Western blot analysis
Cells were treated with different concentrations of
TFC or TNC (0.016 to 0.25 mM), Ly294002 (Ly, 0.016
mM), or Bay (0.0032 mM). The cells in control group
were treated with DMSO [0.1% (v/v), final concentration].
The treated cells were collected either at 30 minutes for
detection of phosphorylation ratios of pEGFR/EGFR,
and pAkt/Akt, or at 48 hours for detection of the protein
expression of Bcl-2, Bax, procaspase/caspase-3, PARP1, cyclin D1, p21WAF1, p53, NF-κB (p65), VEGFR1,
VEGFR2, and cytosolic cytochrome c using our
published methods with some modifications [19-20; 30].
Whole cellular proteins were extracted, and the cytosolic
fraction proteins were prepared following the procedure
described by the manufacturer (Beyotime, Haimen,
China). The protein concentration of the extracts was
determined using the Bradford method. Equal amounts
of cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred
to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with the primary
antibodies to the detected proteins mentioned above,
and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies, respectively. Anti-β-actin antibody was used as
a loading control. Detection was done using an enhanced
chemiluminescence system (GE Healthcare Life Sciences,

Subcutaneous tumor model
Female BALB/c nu/nu mice and C57/BL6 mice (age
range, 6 weeks) were purchased from Tumor Research
Institute, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China).
All animal procedures were carried out in accordance
with the guidelines established by the Animal Care and
Use Committee (ACUC) at Yantai University and were
approved by the ACUC at Yantai University, China.
Single-cell suspensions containing 3 × 106 A549 or 0.6
× 106 LLC cells in 0.1 mL Hank’s balanced salt solution
were injected s.c. into rear right flank of each BALB/c nu/
nu mouse (in the case of A549 cells) or each C57/BL6
mouse (in the case of LLC cells), respectively. After 1015 days, the tumor models were established. The tumorbearing mice were randomly divided into four groups (six
and seven mice pre group for LLC and A549 experiments,
respectively): (1) control group (vehicle); (2) cisplatin
group for LLC tumor treatment (1.5 mg/kg/day; 6 days
each week); endostar group for A549 tumor treatment (7
mg/kg/day; 6 days each week); (3) TFC group (TFC 80
mg/kg/day); (4)TNC group (TNC 80 mg/kg/day). The

mice were treated with vehicle, cisplatin, endosatr, TFC
and TNC by introperitoneal injection once every day.
The therapy was performed for 15 days (in the case of
LLC tumors) and 28 days (in the case of A549 tumors),
respectively. Tumor volumes were measured every two
days (LLC tumors) or three days (A549 tumors). On the
15th or 28th day, mice in all groups were sacrificed and
tumors were weighed. Results were plotted as relative
tumor weight and growth (volume) for the first day of
the treatment up to the final day [31]. The relative tumor
weight is relative to that of the control (vehicle) designated
as 100.

Statistical analysis

Conflict of Interest Disclosures

The data were expressed as mean ± standard
deviation (S.D.) and analyzed by the SPSS 16.0 software
to evaluate the statistical difference. Statistical analysis
was done using the ANOVA and Bonferroni post-test.
Values between different treatment groups at different
times were compared. The rate (%) of relative cell
migration, growth, and mean protein levels as well as
the relative tumor volumes and weights are shown for
each group. For all tests, P values less than 0.05 were
considered statistically significant. All statistical tests were
two-sided.
