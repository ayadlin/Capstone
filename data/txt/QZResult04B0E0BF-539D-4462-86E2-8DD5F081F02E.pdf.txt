BACKGROUND: Cancer and its treatment lead to increased financial distress for patients. To the authors’ knowledge, to date, no standardized patient-reported outcome measure has been validated to assess this distress. METHODS: Patients with AJCC Stage IV solid
tumors receiving chemotherapy for at least 2 months were recruited. Financial toxicity was measured by the COmprehensive Score
for financial Toxicity (COST) measure. The authors collected data regarding patient characteristics, clinical trial participation, health
care use, willingness to discuss costs, psychological distress (Brief Profile of Mood States [POMS]), and health-related quality of life
(HRQOL) as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy: General (FACT-G) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QOL questionnaires. Test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and validity of the COST
measure were assessed using standard-scale construction techniques. Associations between the resulting factors and other variables
were assessed using multivariable analyses. RESULTS: A total of 375 patients with advanced cancer were approached, 233 of whom
(62.1%) agreed to participate. The COST measure demonstrated high internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Factor analyses
revealed a coherent, single, latent variable (financial toxicity). COST values were found to be correlated with income (correlation coefficient [r] 5 0.28; P<.001), psychosocial distress (r 5 -0.26; P<.001), and HRQOL, as measured by the FACT-G (r 5 0.42; P<.001) and by
the EORTC QOL instruments (r 5 0.33; P<.001). Independent factors found to be associated with financial toxicity were race (P 5.04),
employment status (P<.001), income (P 5.003), number of inpatient admissions (P 5.01), and psychological distress (P 5.003). Willingness to discuss costs was not found to be associated with the degree of financial distress (P 5.49). CONCLUSIONS: The COST
measure demonstrated reliability and validity in measuring financial toxicity. Its correlation with HRQOL indicates that financial toxiciC 2016 The Authors. Cancer published by Wiley Periodity is a clinically relevant patient-centered outcome. Cancer 2017;123:476-84. V

INTRODUCTION
Patients with cancer often are confronted with the financial consequences of cancer treatment, which may include significant out-of-pocket costs, loss of income, and caregiver burden.1,2 The objective financial consequences of cancer, as well
as the subjective financial concerns, have been broadly termed “financial toxicity.”3,4 This burden has since been linked
with several clinically relevant patient outcomes, including health-related quality of life (HRQOL)5; symptom burden6;
compliance7; and, most recently, survival.8
Within the context of current policies and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), many newly insured patients are expected to have a higher cost share because of preferential enrollment into high-deductible plans offering greater upfront affordability.9-11 Combined with escalating cancer costs, these high-deductible plans may increase
financial distress and further exacerbate disparities in cancer care. To abrogate the impact of financial distress and

minimize its potential to augment disparities, there is an
urgent need for policy makers, researchers, and clinicians
to accurately measure financial toxicity. However, to the
best of our knowledge, this patient-centered toxicity is
rarely assessed in clinical practice or research.12
The COmprehensive Score for financial Toxicity
(COST) patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) was
previously developed by de Souza et al4 to assess financial
toxicity in patients with cancer. In a multistep process,
155 patients with advanced cancer were interviewed to develop the 11-item COST measure. In response to the urgent need for such a tool, the instrument was adopted into
clinical practice and research before the establishment of
its psychometric properties.13 The current study examines
the COST measure with respect to its psychometric properties, or how well it measures the construct of interest.
The importance of knowing these properties was emphasized by the US Food and Drug Administration guidance
on PROMs, in which it was recommended that an instrument’s measurement properties should be well established
before its use.14 Finally, to assess its relevance for clinical
practice as well as patient-centered research, we also aimed
to evaluate whether patient-reported financial toxicity was
correlated with HRQOL.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample

Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years with a
diagnosis of AJCC stage IV cancer, regardless of prior disease. Patients receiving chemotherapy (oral, intravenous,
or both) for at least 2 months at the time of the interview
and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 to 2 were approached for
participation. Because the goal of the current study was to
determine whether this instrument was valid in measuring
financial concerns, we chose patients with advanced disease who had been receiving therapy for at least 2 months
as a sample most likely to have received health care bills
and to have experienced financial issues. Patients were
recruited at 2 separate cancer centers: The University of
Chicago Medicine and The NorthShore University
HealthSystem. The study protocol was approved by local
Institutional Review Boards, and all patients provided informed consent. Patients were recruited from May 2013
to February 2015. Potential participants were told that
the general goal of the study was “to learn about factors
that may affect your experience as a cancer patient,” but
they were not prospectively told the specific objectives of
the current study.

Measures
Sociodemographic characteristics, health care use,
and willingness to discuss costs

Data related to age, sex, education, work status, marital status, race, ethnicity, ECOG PS, and cancer type were collected. We asked patients for their income from all sources
within the previous year. Household income was measured
as a function of the federal poverty level (FPL).The FPL is
used for Health Insurance Marketplace cost assistance under the ACA, in which tax credit eligibility for health insurance ranges from 138% to 400% of the FPL in states that
decided to expand Medicaid. Financial toxicity was measured by the COST measure (Fig. 1).4 Lower COST values
indicate more financial toxicity. General mood disturbance
or psychological distress was measured by the Brief Profile
of Mood States (Brief-POMS).15 Emergency department
visits and inpatient admissions from 1 year before the interview date were collected as measures of health resource use.
To control for different communication preferences related
to costs and thus any resulting bias when responding to the
questionnaires, patients were asked whether they were willing to discuss costs with their medical team (“I would like
to talk about my out-of-pocket health care costs when a test
or treatment is recommend”).16 This question is based on
the seminal work of Alexander et al for the assessment of
communication preferences.16 Concurrent participation in
a clinical trial at the time of the interview also was recorded
because patients taking part in clinical trials may not be responsible for some of their treatment costs.
HRQOL assessments

HRQOL was assessed by 2 widely validated instruments:
the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General
(FACT-G)17 and the European Organization for Research
and Treatment of Cancer’s Quality of Life Questionnaireglobal health status (EORTC-QOL).18 We hypothesized
that higher financial toxicity would have mild to moderate
correlation with worse HRQOL.
Psychometric analyses

Guidelines from the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR)19,20 and the
COSMIN study (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments)21 for
PROM development were followed. The methods used to
assess the factor structure and its analysis are available in
the Supporting Information.

measure the same latent variable, was assessed by the
Cronbach a. Values > .90 were considered excellent. In
addition, for a sample of patients, the COST measure was
readministered within a 7-day interval (test-retest). The
test-retest reliability was assessed by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) using a 1-way random effects
model.
Convergent validity was assessed by calculating the
Pearson correlation between the COST and the BriefPOMS measures. We hypothesized that the COST measure (financial toxicity) would have a mild to moderate
and statistically significant correlation with the BriefPOMS measure (psychological distress). Similarly, we hy478

pothesized that the COST measure would have a mild to
moderate, statistically significant correlation with income.
The rationale for the mild and moderate correlations is
that strong correlations would conclude that the COST
PROM would actually be measuring psychological
distress, HRQOL, or income, rather than financial toxicity. Divergent validity was assessed using correlations between the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale
(MCSDS)22 and the COST measure. The MCSDS is a
widely used measure of self-reported social desirability.
For validation purposes, it measures the degree to which
individuals attempt to present themselves in a favorable
light. We hypothesized that financial toxicity would not

have statistically significant correlations with social desirability. All the instruments are described in Supporting
Information Table 1.
Factors Associated With Financial Toxicity

Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to
compare the average COST values obtained from groups
of patients that were expected to differ with respect to the
construct (“known groups” validity). The dependent variable was the COST value. Independent variables considered included: patient sociodemographic characteristics,
cancer type, length of original diagnosis (from the time of
the original cancer diagnosis to the interview date), health
care use, psychological distress, communication preferences, and whether the patient was taking part in a clinical
trial. Considering the financial domain of this PROM, we
included household income and use of health care resources (with potential implications for cost-sharing and loss
of income) as additional factors to be investigated. We
thus hypothesized that individuals in lower FPL groups
would have worse financial toxicity, as would patients
with higher health care use (as measured by emergency department visits or inpatient admissions), independent of
the other variables.
Statistical Analyses

Differences between participants and nonparticipants with
regard to baseline characteristics were tested using Student t
tests or chi-square tests, as appropriate. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to assess the relation between the
COST measure and HRQOL. In addition, partial correlations with HRQOL were calculated, adjusting for age,23
ECOG PS,24 and variables that were found to be significantly associated with financial toxicity on multivariable
analyses. Correlations were defined as mild if between 0.20
and 0.39, moderate if between 0.40 and 0.59, strong if between 0.60 and 0.79, and very strong if between 0.80 and
1.0. A sample size of 233 patients provided 80% power
with which to detect a correlation coefficient >0.18 between the COST measure and the HRQOL instruments
using a 2-sided significance level of .05. For the test-retest
analysis, a sample size of 20 patients who were assessed
twice within a 7-day period provided > 80% power to
demonstrate excellent reliability25 (ICC of 0.75, assuming
an ICC under the null hypothesis of 0.35) with a significance level of .05. In differential item functioning analyses,
a Bonferroni correction was used to control for multiple
comparisons, with a P value threshold set at <.0045. On
the multivariable analyses, variables included in the final
model were those approaching statistical significance on

univariable analysis (P<.10), and those in which we had a
substantial interest (clinical trial participation and willingness to discuss costs). Interactions were tested, and if they
were found to be statistically significant, they were included
in the final model. Missing data were addressed by each
instrument’s guidelines. All analyses were performed with
Stata statistical software (version 13; StataCorp LP, College
Station, Tex).26
RESULTS
Of the 375 patients who were approached, 236 (62.9%)
agreed to participate. Reasons for nonparticipation were
“not interested in any research” (103 patients) and “not
feeling well” (36 patients). In addition, 3 patients started
the survey and withdrew consent due to its financial connotation, leaving a total of 233 evaluable patients (participation rate of 62.1%). Respondents were more likely to
be younger on average (58.42 years vs 63.21 years;
P<.001) and married (73.3% vs 61.3%; P 5 .02) compared with nonrespondents. Sex (P 5 .08), insurance status (P 5 .07), race (P 5 .07), and household income
distribution (P 5 .07) were found to demonstrate a trend
toward a difference but did not reach statistical significance at the .05 level. Data regarding the 142 patients
(37.9%) who declined participation are shown in Online
Supporting Information Table 2.
Participants had a median age of 59 years (range,
27-88 years; mean 6 standard deviation [SD], 58.42 6
11.47 years), and 58% of patients were female. All had
health insurance coverage, which was mostly private or
purchased by their employer (62%), followed by Medicare with or without supplementation (31%). No patients
had acquired insurance through the ACA Marketplace.
The median length of time from the first cancer diagnosis
was 485 days (range, 56-9294 days). The median household income was 376% of the FPL (range, 0%-7964%).
In addition, 47% of patients had completed college or
had achieved higher education, whereas 15% had less
than a college education, with 5.1% of patients having less
than a high school education. The median COST value
was 23 (range, 0-44; mean 6 SD, 22.23 6 11.89). Table

in the analyses, as well as their COST values. Online Supporting Information Table 3 describes their primary tumor types. Online Supplementary Information Table 4

for males and females were comparable at .92 and .91, respectively. The test-retest analysis revealed an ICC of 0.80
(95% confidence interval, 0.57-0.92). The Pearson correlation for the COST measure and the Brief-POMS was 0.26 (P<.001), indicating that worse financial toxicity
was correlated with higher psychological distress. Not surprisingly, financial toxicity was found to be correlated
with household income at 0.28 (P<.001), indicating financial toxicity (lower COST values) among patients in
the lower FPL groups. With regard to divergent validity,
the association between the COST measure and social desirability (MCSDS) was near zero (0.11) and not statistically significant (P 5 .11), as initially hypothesized.

Factors Associated With Financial Toxicity

As shown in Table 1, we found several factors that were associated with financial toxicity on univariable analyses.
Communication preferences and clinical trial status were
not found to be significantly associated with financial toxicity (Table 2). However, given their theoretical importance when assessing financial toxicity, they were included
as potential confounders in the multivariable analyses. In
the final multivariable model, employment status
(P<.001), race (P 5 .04), household income (P 5 .003),
psychological distress (P 5 .003), and the number of inpatient admissions (P 5 .01) were found to be significantly associated with financial toxicity when controlling for
age, sex, marital status, insurance type, clinical trial participation, and communication preferences, as shown in
Table 3. It is important to note that no statistically significant interactions were found, including the interaction between employment and income (P 5 .32). Nonwhite
individuals tended to have lower COST scores (worse financial toxicity) compared with white individuals. Similarly, unemployed patients had lower COST scores
compared with other groups, reaching statistical significance for all groups except those on disability. Higher psychological distress values were associated with lower
COST scores. Those patients with  3 inpatient admissions had lower COST scores (indicating worse financial
toxicity), by nearly 6 points on average, compared with

Financial Toxicity and HRQOL

The median FACT-G value was 79 (range, 23-108;
mean 6 SD, 77.01 6 17.21). The median EORTCQOL value was 66 (range, 0-100; mean 6 SD, 61.51 6
22.41). The Pearson correlation for the COST measure
and the FACT-G was 0.42 (P<.001), whereas its correlation with the EORTC-QOL was 0.33 (P<.001). When
we controlled for age, ECOG PS, income, psychological
distress, inpatient admissions, employment status, and
ethnicity, these correlations remained statistically significant (FACT-G partial correlation of 0.31 [P<.001]; and
EORTC-QOL partial correlation of 0.20 [P<.001]),
thereby confirming our hypothesis that financial toxicity
was correlated with worse HRQOL.
DISCUSSION
Using a hypothesis-based approach,19-21 the results of the
current study validate the COST measure as a measure of
financial toxicity specifically developed for patients with
cancer. We also demonstrated its statistically significant
correlation with HRQOL, thus establishing it as a clinically relevant patient-centered measure.
The reported correlations (Brief-POMS, HRQOL,
and income) were mild but statistically significant, as hypothesized. These correlations add to the instrument’s validity because it demonstrates that the COST-PROM is
not measuring psychosocial distress, HRQOL, or income,
as we would potentially observe with strong or very strong
correlations. The identification of factors associated with
financial toxicity is equally important. To the best of our
knowledge, the current study is the first to report on the
relationship between financial toxicity and the use of
health care resources. We found that higher numbers of
inpatient admissions were associated with higher financial
toxicity, even when adjusted for potentially confounding
factors. The importance of inpatient admissions in total
health care costs has been demonstrated previously. Chastek et al27 demonstrated that 55% of total health care costs
within the last 6 months of life are related to inpatient
admissions. However, to our knowledge, the study by
Chastek et al did not address patient’s financial toxicity.
In the current study, we demonstrated that inpatient
482

admissions also impact the financial toxicity of individual
patients.
The current study has several strengths. First, we analyzed data regarding individuals who declined participation, with only 3 patients withdrawing consent because of
this being a study assessing financial issues. A major
strength also was assessing potential confounders when
measuring financial toxicity. We controlled for psychological distress and for participation in clinical trials, and
the results were found to be independent of these factors.
In addition, although communication preferences were
not the focus of the current study, there was the theoretical concern that a patient’s willingness to discuss financial
issues could potentially introduce bias into the patient’s
perspective about the topic and, thus, the self-reported
COST assessment. However, the willingness to discuss financial issues was not found to be significantly associated
with COST values. Finally, an instrument is of little relevance if it is not correlated with clinically meaningful outcomes. Herein, we demonstrated that financial toxicity, as
measured by the COST measure, is correlated with
HRQOL as measured by 2 validated quantitative
HRQOL instruments (FACT-G and EORTC-QOL),
when adjusting for potentially confounding factors.
A limitation of the current study is that the study
sample was drawn from tertiary referral health care centers, and all participants had some form of insurance coverage. However, it is well known that even insured
patients can face significant financial burdens, especially if
their insurance plan has high deductibles or if patients are
at risk of exceeding lifetime limits.10 In addition, because
it was not feasible to extensively and repeatedly interview
patients with a poor ECOG PS, we limited our sample to
those patients with an ECOG PS <3. Also, given our
cross-sectional design, we did not assess whether financial
toxicity was related to out-of-pocket costs, loss of productivity, or other factors. These limitations should be considered from the perspective that the goal of the current
study was to develop a financial toxicity instrument and
not to identify all the populations at risk or the drivers of
financial toxicity within this validation cohort. We aimed
to demonstrate that this instrument measures what it was
designed to measure. Therefore, the objective of the current study was to empirically demonstrate the association
between financial toxicity, as measured by this instrument, with well-known social factors that in theory would
play a role in it, demonstrating the validity of the instrument. In this regard, race, income, inpatient admissions,
and employment status were found to be associated with
financial toxicity in the current study population, as

measured by the COST instrument, independent of psychological distress, the willingness to discuss costs, and
other factors. Underserved groups within the current
study sample, such as those with low income, as well as African American individuals, were found to have worse
COST values; it is likely that the findings of the current
study would be replicated in uninsured or underinsured
samples. This hypothesis should be validated and confirmed in future studies with a more diverse insurance case
mix and specifically designed to identify populations at
risk, such as those with less than a high school education,
which was also a population relatively underrepresented
in the current study sample (5.1%). Similarly, the differences with regard to the drivers of financial toxicity among
patients with different cancer types should be examined
because these drivers may vary by the type of disease or by
the type of treatment. Although toxicity thresholds were
not analyzed within this validation sample, the quantitative nature of the COST instrument will allow further
prospective studies to determine the exact impact of financial toxicity on HRQOL in comparison with other symptoms and on other outcomes, such as survival. These
prospective studies also are needed to determine responsiveness to change, as well as floor and ceiling effects of the
COST-PROM. Finally, because the objective of the current study was to validate whether the COST-PROM captured financial toxicity, we needed patients who had
actually had experience with health care bills. Therefore,
we assessed patients with stage IV disease who were receiving treatment for at least 2 months with chemotherapy,
and we were unable to conclude that newly diagnosed
patients would provide similar results.
As society increasingly considers the costs incurred
by patients with cancer as a side effect of treatment, instruments to measure financial toxicity should be patientcentered, scientifically derived, and clinically relevant.
The correlation with HRQOL establishes financial toxicity as a clinically relevant, patient-centered measure. The
incorporation of financial toxicity assessments into observational research and clinical trials will ensure a patientcentered foundation in the evaluation of financial distress.
