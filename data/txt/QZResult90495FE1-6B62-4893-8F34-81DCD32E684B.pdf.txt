Reply to Margin Assessment in
Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma
We thank Duvvuri et al for their thoughtful comments on
our study.1 The premise of our study was to retrospectively assess our treatment outcome (local control and
disease-specific survival) in a subgroup of patients with
oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with close margin
treated with surgery alone. This was done in response to 2
randomized trials conducted by RTOG and EORTC that
concluded patients with close margin (<5 mm) would
benefit from escalation of treatment with chemotherapyenhanced radiation therapy following surgery.2 We did
not analyze patients who had involved surgical margins,
because in our practice, they would qualify for at least
postoperative radiotherapy, and hence, there is no need to
subject them to scrutiny in reference to outcomes from
the aforementioned trials.In both trials,3,4 tumors from
heterogenous sites including the oral cavity, oropharynx,
hypopharynx, and larynx were grouped, and therefore the
criticism of our study for including all oral subsites is
probably unjust. Univariate analysis was performed on
the different subsites (tongue, floor of mouth, buccal, and
others) for local control (P 5 .14) and disease-specific survival (P 5 .48). In addition, based on one of our previous
multi-institutional studies that showed buccal mucosal
primaries to be a more high-risk subsite,5 and the wide
confidence intervals in statistical analysis in our current
study for the buccal subsite, we cautioned against generalizing our overall conclusion to buccal SCC.
It was rightly pointed out, however, that not taking
into consideration revision of a close margin is a limitation
of our study. Excision of primary tumor with frozen section
control is uncommon in our practice for most oral cavity
SCC. Because of the belief that only a small percentage of
these patients would have had additional margin taken, we
did not adjust for this factor in our study. However, in preparing this response, we decided to review supplemental pathology reports for information on revision of close margin.
We found 13 of 144 (9%) patients did indeed have their
close margin revised, and in retrospect, these patients
should ideally have been excluded from the study. However, it is, as we suspected, a small minority and exclusion
of these cases does not alter the overall findings of our
study. As for the difficulty with accounting for a bony margin, it is standard practice that if underlying bone is
removed/burred, the soft tissue margin is not assigned as a
true margin. We did not differentiate between the radial or
454

deep margin, because although margin revision is easier in
the former, there is generally no difference in prognosis or
treatment based on this specific difference.
Distinguishing between local and regional nodal
recurrence may be problematic; however, in our database,
cases that are indistinguishable in this regard are counted
as both local and regional recurrence.

Phase 1 Study of Cetuximab in
Combination With 5-Fluorouracil,
Cisplatin, and Radiotherapy in
Patients With Locally Advanced
Anal Canal Carcinoma
We read with interest the excellent article by Olivatto
et al,1 in which they present the results of their phase 1
trial in patients with locally advanced anal canal carcinoma (LAACC) who were treated with cetuximab, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and radiotherapy. Despite the
promising preliminary efficacy results, the study was
closed before moving on to phase 2 due to toxicity

concerns: in particular, 6 of the 23 patients included the
study (26%) developed thromboembolic events that were
attributed to treatment. The authors suggested that the
anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy
itself might be one predisposing factor toward the development of such thromboembolic events. We believe that
the preliminary results of our phase 2 trial with panitumumab, mitomycin-C, 5-FU, and radiotherapy in patients
with LAACC, which was developed by the Grupo Espaol Multidisciplinar en Cancer Digestivo (GEMCAD)
(NCT01285778), might shed some light on this debate.
In this phase 2 trial, patients receive panitumumab (at a
dose of 6 mg/kg on day 1 every 2 weeks for 8 weeks),
mitomycin-C (at a dose of 10 mg/m2 every 28 days 3 2),
and 5-FU (at a dose of 1000 mg/m2/day as an intravenous
infusion on days 1-4 every 28 days 3 2) concurrently
with radiotherapy at a dose of 45 grays (Gy) (1.8 Gy per
fraction) to the primary tumor and mesorectal, iliac, and
inguinal lymph nodes, followed by a boost of 10 Gy to 15
Gy to the primary tumor and affected lymph nodes. We
would like to remark that in the interim analysis, which
was performed after the first 28 patients were treated, no
thromboembolic events were reported. These findings are
in concordance with the preliminary results of 2 other trials in which patients with LAACC were treated with
cetuximab, cisplatin, 5-FU, and radiotherapy and no
thromboembolic events were reported.2,3 Olivatto et al
highlighted a recent meta-analysis that suggested an
increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients
treated with anti-EGFR therapy plus chemotherapy in
comparison with those treated with chemotherapy alone.1
However, the risk was only 1.8% higher for patients
treated with anti-EGFR (5.7% vs 3.9%),4 and we do not
believe that this small increase justifies the 26% increase
noted in the trial by Olivatto and al.1 In addition, the use
of cisplatin has been associated with an increased risk of
venous thromboembolism,5 but to the best of our knowledge, none of the recent phase 3 trials that included
patients with LAACC who were treated with cisplatin and
5-FU have confirmed these findings.6-8
For these reasons, we believe that different factors
may be influencing these events. In the study by Olivatto
et al,1 the 6 patients developed symptomatic deep venous
thrombosis in the upper extremities in the area in which a
central venous catheter was placed, and local factors might
have played an important role in the development of this
complication. In keeping with this, it is important to
highlight that 3 of those patients had a peripherally
inserted central catheter device, which has been reported
to have a risk of deep vein thrombosis of 6.67% (95%

confidence interval, 4.69%-8.64%). Furthermore, the
risk of deep venous thrombosis with a peripherally
inserted central catheter is higher than with other central
venous catheters (odds ratio, 2.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.54-4.23 [P < .0001]).9 There are also other local
factors that have been suggested to influence this complication such as catheter materials, insertion practices, and
catheter maintenance.10 Concomitant illnesses also could
have played a major role in the development of this complication. Although patients with severe cardiovascular
disease were excluded from the study by Olivatto et al,1 it
is not mentioned whether patients with previous thromboembolic events were eligible to participate in the trial.
In conclusion, although the thromboembolic events
reported in the trial by Olivatto et al1 might have a multifactorial origin, we believe that local factors related to the
central venous catheters played a major role in the high
incidence of this complication.

impact on the VTE rate, which continued to occur in
25%, or 3 of 12 patients. Conversely, the use of agents
with potential risk for VTE (cisplatin and cetuximab) in
combination may be an issue. In our experience with the
use of only cisplatin-based chemoradiation in 86 patients
with locally advanced anal canal carcinoma, no patient
developed VTE.2
Cumulative toxicities may be relevant. In our trial,
the majority of patients received full treatment and
developed severe toxicities, and the majority of the cases
of VTE occurred after the second cycle of chemotherapy.
Conversely, in the ACCORD 16 trial,3 which is more
similar to ours, no VTE occurred, but only 8 of the 16 enrolled patients completed treatment. In fact, a constellation of factors such as diarrhea, infection, neutropenia,
and hospitalization may have played a role.
Secondly, severe comorbidities or cardiovascular
disease were exclusion criteria in our trial. The
Khorana et al predictive model for chemotherapyassociated thrombosis was applied in all patients.4
Only 3 of 23 patients were found to have an intermediated risk for VTE, and the remaining 20 patients
were found to be at low risk for developing VTE. In
conclusion, local factors and comorbidities do not
appear to have played a major role in the high VTE
rate found in our study.1
CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURES

Feliu et al believe that local factors related to the central
venous catheters (CVC) played a major role in the high
incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) reported in
our phase 1 trial.1 Moreover, they claim that the inclusion
of patients with concomitant severe illness favored the
increased rates of VTE. They bring to light their own
phase 2 experience in treating patients with locally
advanced anal canal carcinoma with pelvic chemoradiation
based on the use of mitomycin-C plus panitumumab, in
which no cases of VTE were reported to have occurred. In
addition, they refer to the results of two phase 2 trials that
have been published only in abstract form.
Our reasons for disagreeing with Feliu et al are
manifold. First, comparison across the trials they refer to
is not trivial because different treatment strategies and
agents were administered. Full reports of these trials are
required to draw any conclusion. We believe the type of
catheter used in our study did not influence the rate of
VTE. The alteration of peripherally inserted central catheters to implanted CVCs in 12 patients treated with the
recommended phase 2 dose did not appear to have any
