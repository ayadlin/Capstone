Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Activating AMPK or inactivating calcineurin slows ageing in Caenorhabditis elegans1,2 and both
have been implicated as therapeutic targets for age-related pathology in mammals3–5. However,
the direct targets that mediate their effects on longevity remain unclear. In mammals, CREBregulated transcriptional coactivators (CRTCs)6 are a family of cofactors involved in diverse
physiological processes including energy homeostasis7–9, cancer10 and endoplasmic reticulum
stress11. Here we show that both AMPK and calcineurin modulate longevity exclusively through
post-translational modification of CRTC-1, the sole C. elegans CRTC. We demonstrate that
CRTC-1 is a direct AMPK target, and interacts with the CREB homologue-1 (CRH-1)
transcription factor in vivo. The pro-longevity effects of activating AMPK or deactivating
calcineurin decrease CRTC-1 and CRH-1 activity and induce transcriptional responses similar to
those of CRH-1 null worms. Downregulation of crtc-1 increases lifespan in a crh-1-dependent
manner and directly reducing crh-1 expression increases longevity, substantiating a role for
CRTCs and CREB in ageing. Together, these findings indicate a novel role for CRTCs and CREB
in determining lifespan downstream of AMPK and calcineurin, and illustrate the molecular
mechanisms by which an evolutionarily conserved pathway responds to low energy to increase
longevity.
AMPK and calcineurin antagonistically regulate CRTCs in mammals8 to modulate energy
homeostasis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress9,11. We therefore hypothesized that
CRTCs may be critical longevity targets of AMPK and calcineurin, promoting their effects
on lifespan through transcriptional regulation. We found a single C. elegans CRTC by
homology search (Y20F4.2, now re-named CRTC-1) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1).

crtc-1 was expressed throughout the intestine of the worm, as well as in head and tail
neurons (Fig. 1b), overlapping the expression pattern of the calcineurin catalytic subunit,
tax-6 (ref. 2) and the AMPK catalytic subunit, aak-2 (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Strikingly,
inhibition of crtc-1 via RNA interference (RNAi) (Supplementary Fig. 2b) extended wildtype median lifespan by up to 53% (Fig. 1c), comparable to the effects of tax-6 RNAi or
AAK-2 activation (Fig. 1c, d). Given the significant role of CRTC-1 in longevity, we
investigated whether AMPK and calcineurin modulate ageing through CRTC-1.
In mammals, activated AMPK blocks the transcriptional function of CRTC2 by restricting it
to the cytosol9. We therefore tested the effect of starvation and heat stress, two conditions
known to activate AMPK in C. elegans1, on CRTC-1 cellular localization. A transgenic
strain expressing CRTC-1::RFP revealed that CRTC-1 was present throughout the nucleus
and cytosol under basal conditions (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 2b). Starvation and heat
stress both induced CRTC-1::RFP translocation to the cytosol and nuclear exclusion in
intestinal cells (Fig. 1f–h and Supplementary Fig. 3), illustrating that environmental stimuli
that activate AMPK inactivate CRTC-1.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Next we investigated whether direct activation of AMPK rendered CRTC-1 cytosolic.
Mammalian AMPKα catalytic subunits are activated by phosphorylation of threonine 172 in
their activation loop. Mutation of this residue to aspartic acid or alanine results in a
constitutively active or kinase-dead AMPK, respectively12. Expression of CRTC-1::RFP
with the equivalent activated AAK-2 mutation (amino acids (aa) 1–321, T181D)::GFP,
caused nuclear exclusion of CRTC-1 under fed conditions at 20 °C (Fig. 2a). In contrast,
coexpression of kinase-dead AAK-2 (aa 1–321, T181A)::GFP and CRTC-1::RFP did not
induce nuclear exclusion (Fig. 2a), demonstrating that catalytic activation of AAK-2 by
threonine 181 phosphorylation is required for AAK-2-dependent CRTC-1 nuclear exclusion.
Treatment with tax-6 RNAi caused similar nuclear exclusion of CRTC-1::RFP under fed
conditions (Fig. 2b). In addition, tricaine, a class of anaesthetic known to increase calcium
flux13, induced tax-6-dependent nuclear localization of CRTC-1::RFP (Supplementary Fig.
4a). Suggesting CRTC-1 is a direct calcineurin target, CRTC-1::RFP containing site-specific
mutations in the calcineurin binding site did not translocate to the nucleus in response to
tricaine and was retained in the cytosol (Supplementary Fig. 4b).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Similar to mammalian CRTCs8, cytosolic retention of CRTC-1 required 14-3-3 proteins, as
simultaneous RNAi knockdown of the two C. elegans 14-3-3 proteins ftt-1 (also known as
par-5) and ftt-2 (ref. 14) via RNAi resulted in CRTC-1::RFP accumulation within the
nucleus (Fig. 2c) and blocked CRTC-1::RFP cytosolic sequestering after heat stress
(Supplementary Fig. 5). In addition, we determined that AMPK directly phosphorylates
CRTC-1 at conserved 14-3-3-binding sites. Incubation of CRTC-1 with purified AMPK and
AMP in an in vitro kinase assay resulted in phosphorylation of CRTC-1, as detected by antiphospho-Ser 14-3-3 binding motif antibody (Fig. 2d).
Collectively, these data illustrate that in response to pro-longevity perturbations to AMPK
and calcineurin, CRTC-1 becomes phosphorylated, cytosolically sequestered and
inactivated.
To determine if the lifespan effects of AMPK and calcineurin are due to the inactivation of
CRTC-1, we first examined if crtc-1 RNAi-mediated longevity was epistatic to tax-6.
Although crtc-1 RNAi increased the lifespan of wild-type worms, it had no additive effect
on the extended lifespan of tax-6 mutants (Fig. 3a), in which CRTC-1 is already rendered
cytosolic and inactive (Supplementary Fig. 4a), suggesting that these lifespan mediators
function in a linear pathway.

To examine if CRTC-1 was a direct longevity target of AMPK and calcineurin, we inhibited
phosphorylation of CRTC-1 at two conserved AMPK/calcineurin sites, S76 and S179, both
of which reside within 14-3-3-binding motifs (Supplementary Fig. 1). Previous studies show
that 14-3-3 proteins commonly bind tandem phosphorylated sites within a protein, resulting
in significantly increased affinity over solitary sites due to cooperative binding15,16.
Compound mutation of serines 76 and 179 to alanines in CRTC-1 rendered it constitutively
nuclear and refractory to tax-6 deactivation or aak-2 activation (Fig. 3b, c and
Supplementary Fig. 6).
Notably, although tax-6 RNAi robustly extended the lifespan of C. elegans expressing wildtype CRTC-1::RFP, which translocated to the cytoplasm freely when calcineurin was not
present (Fig. 3d), it had no effect on worms expressing constitutively nuclear CRTC-1
(S76A, S179A) (Fig. 3d). Post-translational modification of CRTC-1 is therefore critical for
the effects of calcineurin on longevity. This longevity suppression was not due to general
sickness as there was no significant difference between the lifespan of wild-type worms and
those expressing CRTC-1 (S76A, S179A) (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Knocking down tax-6
specifically during adulthood again increased wild-type lifespan but had no effect on the
CRTC-1 (S76A, S179A) mutant (Supplementary Fig. 7 b–d), indicating that the CRTC-1dependent effects of tax-6 on lifespan are not solely acting during development.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We used the CRTC-1 (S76A, S179A) mutant to ask whether the extended lifespan of
activated AMPK was also mediated by CRTC-1. Expression of CRTC-1 (S76A, S179A)
fully suppressed the lifespan extension seen in AAK-2-overexpressing worms (Fig. 3e). This
demonstrates that CRTC-1 is both a critical and direct target of aak-2-mediated longevity,
and indicates that AMPK and calcineurin function upstream of a shared longevity pathway
that signals through CRTC-1.
To understand the downstream effectors of CRTC-1, we examined CRH-1, the single C.
elegans orthologue of the cyclic AMP response element binding (CREB) transcription factor
family17. Mammalian CREBs (CREB, CREM and ATF1) associate with CRTCs to activate
transcription and are involved in diverse processes including memory, immunity, DNA
repair, energy homeostasis, fat storage and ER stress18,19. crh-1 is expressed throughout the
worm, in overlapping tissues to crtc-1 (Supplementary Fig. 8a). Co-immunoprecipitation of
Flag::CRTC-1 and HA::CRH-1 demonstrated that these proteins interact in vivo (Fig. 4a and
Supplementary Fig. 8b). The role of CRTC-1 in CRH-1 transcriptional activation was
assessed by the CREB reporter construct pCRE::GFP, which was significantly repressed by
RNAi against crh-1, crtc-1 and tax-6 (Fig. 4b, c).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

If the lifespan extension seen by activating AMPK or deactivating calcineurin functions
through CRTC-1 to inactivate CREB, inactivating crh-1 directly should increase longevity.
Indeed, RNAi of crh-1 increased the lifespan of both wild-type and RNAi-sensitive rrf-3
(pk1426) mutants (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 9). Furthermore, lifespan extension by
crtc-1 RNAi was not seen in crh-1 (nn3315) null mutants (Fig. 4e), indicating that the
longevity effects of inactivating crtc-1 are mediated by crh-1.
We examined the effects of AMPK and calcineurin on CREB-regulated genes by comparing
whole-genome gene expression of activated aak-2, tax-6 null and crh-1 null mutant animals
to wild-type worms (Supplementary Table 1). Despite the many distinct roles of AMPK and
calcineurin, we found that long-lived worms with activated aak-2 or deactivated tax-6 had
transcriptional profiles significantly similar to crh-1 null animals (Fig. 4f, g and
Supplementary Fig. 10). The directionality of the transcriptional changes induced by
activated aak-2 and inactivated tax-6 was also remarkably similar to crh-1 nulls, with the
majority of genes (150 or 67.5%) affected by all mutants exhibiting shared patterns of

expression (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 11). Further, differentially expressed genes
across all groups were highly enriched for cAMP regulatory elements (CRE) and the
presence of a TATA box in their upstream promoter region (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig.
12a), two signatures of highly inducible CREB targets. Interestingly, and in contrast to
CREB function in mammals, gene expression analysis revealed that CRH-1 may function as
a bifunctional transcriptional regulator, as both upregulated and downregulated genes in
crh-1 null animals were enriched for CREs (Supplementary Fig. 12b).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In mammals, AMPK and CREB are involved in energy homeostasis, particularly in response
to starvation. Surprisingly, differentially expressed genes in aak-2-overexpressing, tax-6 null
mutant and crh-1 null mutant animals were not markedly enriched for genes related to
metabolism. Rather, there was strong upregulation of genes involved in ER stress, with 55%
of known activated in blocked unfolded protein response family members (ABU)20,
upregulated by all mutants (P = 1.7× 10−8, Fisher’s exact test; Fig. 4f, Supplementary Fig.
10 and Supplementary Table 2). abu genes are induced in response to ER stress when the
unfolded protein response pathway (UPR) is blocked and are therefore thought to act in
parallel to the UPR to maintain protein homeostasis20. abu genes are required for innate
immunity21 and, notably, are activated by resveratrol and critical for its effects on longevity
in C. elegans22. Furthermore, overexpression of abu family members increases lifespan in
the worm22. It will be interesting to determine the potential role of ER stress in lifespan
extension via AMPK–calcineurin–CRTC-1 signalling and whether CRTC-1 has a role in
resveratrol-mediated lifespan extension.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our data indicate that CRTC-1 is the critical direct longevity target of both AMPK and
calcineurin in C. elegans and identify a new role for CRTCs and CREB in modulating
longevity. They also represent the first analysis of the transcriptional profiles of long-lived
activated AMPK and deactivated calcineurin organisms and suggest the primary longevityassociated role of these perturbations is the modulation of CRTC-1 and CRH-1
transcriptional activity. Notably, both the FOXO transcription factor daf-16 (ref. 23) and
genes involved in autophagy24 have also been implicated in AMPK and calcineurin
longevity, respectively. Further work to determine precisely where the AMPK–calcineurin–
CRTC-1 pathway converges with FOXO and autophagy will be enlightening. It will also be
interesting to determine if CRTC-1 mediates downstream effects of kinases other than
AMPK. In mammals, CRTCs are regulated by multiple CAMKL kinase family
members8,9,25 (Supplementary Table 3), and we saw additive effects of AMPK and related
kinases on the localization of CRTC-1, in particular the MAP/microtubule affinityregulating kinase (MARK) par-1, indicating that this kinase may also regulate CRTC-1 in
vivo (Supplementary Fig. 13c, d). At present, however, AMPK is the only CAMKL kinase
shown to be a positive regulator of longevity.
Collectively, these data identify CRTC-1 as a central node linking the upstream lifespan
modifiers AMPK and calcineurin to CREB activity via a shared signal-transduction
pathway, and demonstrate that post-translational modification of CRTC-1 is required for
their effects on longevity (Supplementary Fig. 14). Complementing the pro-longevity effects
of inhibiting CRTC function in C. elegans, reducing components of the CRTC/CREB
pathway has recently been shown to confer health benefits to mice9,19,26–28. Given the
evolutionary conservation of this pathway from C. elegans to mammals29 it will be
fascinating to determine the role of CRTCs both as mammalian ageing modulators and as
potential drug targets for patients with metabolic disorders and cancer.

METHODS SUMMARY
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A detailed description of all experimental methods including C. elegans strains
(Supplementary Table 4), growth, imaging, lifespan analysis and RNAi application is
provided in Methods. None of the RNAi treatments used affected feeding rates
(Supplementary Fig. 15). Transgenic strains were generated via microinjection into the
gonad of adult hermaphrodites using standard techniques. Integrated transgenic lines were
generated using gamma irradiation and outcrossed to wild-type at least four times. All
lifespans were conducted at 20 °C with deaths scored and live worms transferred to new
plates every 1–2 days, see Supplementary Table 5 for statistical analysis and replicate data.
JMP 8/Graphpad Prism 5 and R/Bioconductor software were used for all statistical analyses.

METHODS
Lifespan studies

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

All lifespan experiments were performed on standard 6-cm nematode growth media plates30
supplemented with 100μg ml−1 carbenicillin at 20 °C. Plates were removed from 4 °C
storage 2 days before seeding with 100μl of Escherichia coli HT115 containing either empty
vector or RNAi inducing plasmids. RNAi for a particular gene can be readily achieved in the
worm by feeding C. elegans E. coli (HT115) that express double-stranded RNA of the gene
of interest31. Bacterial cultures were grown overnight at 37 °C in the presence of both
carbenicillin (100μg ml−1) and tetracycline (10μg ml−1) before seeding onto NGM plates.
Once seeded, bacterial lawns were grown at room temperature (25 °C) for 48 h. RNAi was
induced with 100μl IPTG (100 mM) 2 h before worms were added to plates. To agesynchronize worms, five gravid adults (24 h post larval stage four, L4) were placed on plates
with the appropriate control or RNAi bacteria and allowed to lay eggs for 5 h before being
removed. These eggs were then cultured to adulthood (72 h post egg lay at 20 °C) before
being moved to fresh plates at a density of 10 worms per plate, 10 plates per treatment. Age
= 0 was defined as the day adults were moved to 10 worms a plate. Worms were moved to
fresh plates every 1–2 days until day 14, after which only those on mould-contaminated
plates were transferred. Worms were censored at the first sign of any bacterial
contamination. Death was scored by gentle agitation with a worm pick and confirmed with
no response after three attempts at both the head and tail. Death was scored every 1–2 days
throughout.
RNAi constructs

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

RNAi tax-6 and crh-1 (1) (Supplementary Fig. 9) constructs used were taken from the Vidal
RNAi library. The ctrc-1 (1) (Supplementary Fig. 9) RNAi plasmid was made by cloning
full-length crtc-1 cDNA between the two inverted T7 promoters in the pAD12 RNAi
plasmid and transformed into HT115 cells. Remaining RNAi constructs used in
Supplementary Fig. 9 are in the L4440 plasmid. Primers against cDNA were as follows.
CRTC-1 (2): 5′-GGATCACCGGTTCAGATGCAT, 3′-AGGTGCACCTTCAGCATTTGT.
CRTC-1 (3): 5′-GAGCTCCAAGGACATCGAAGTCG, 3′CTCGAGTGGATGCATTGGAACCATACC. CRH-1 (2): 5′GAGCTCATGGCCACAATGGCGAG, 3′-CTCGAGCTTATCCGCCGTTTCTA.
DAPI staining
Worms were washed in 1 ml M9 (ref. 30) in a watch glass (1–3 times, until bacteria is
removed). M9 was almost completely removed before 100–200 μl DAPI (200 ng ml−1 in
ethanol) was added. DAPI treatment was incubated in darkness for 20 min or until the
ethanol had evaporated. One millilitre of M9 was then added to rehydrate for 1 h (up to 5 h
at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C). One drop (~3 μl) of ProLong mounting medium

was placed on a slide before transferring the stained worm. A cover slip was added and
sealed with nail polish. Fluorescence was examined at 358 nm.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Heat stress and starvation assays
Effects of heat and starvation on CRTC-1::RFP was measured by placing C. elegans
expressing crtc-1::RFP onto either OP50-seeded NGM plates at 33 °C overnight or into 9well plates containing M9 media at 20 °C. Controls were C. elegans fed OP50 at 20 °C.
Microscopy
All microscopy was performed using 0.1 mg ml−1 tetramisole hydrochloride in M9 as an
anaesthetic, which pilot experiments revealed had no effect on CRTC-1 localization. Except
for tricaine time-course experiments, worms were in 5 μl anaesthetic mounted on 2%
agarose pads on glass slides under glass cover slips. All photographs were taken using a
Zeiss Axiovert microscope and AxioCam. Pictures in Figs 2a and 3b used ApoTome optical
sectioning. For the tricaine experiments (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b), L4 worms were placed
in wells of a 96-well plate in 100 μl of tetramisole/M9 with or without tricaine (2 mg ml−1).
Pictures were taken during the time-course through the 96-well plate.
Kinase redundancy assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Worms were subjected to RNAi for CAMKL kinases from hatch. Twenty-four hours postL4 worms were then picked into M9 with tricaine (2 mg ml−1) in wells of a 9-well plate.
Worms were left on a rotational shaker at 20 °C for 2 h. Using a glass pipette32 worms were
then placed onto NG plates seeded with E. coli (OP50). When tricaine solution had
evaporated (approx 20 min), worms were picked onto fresh OP50 plates, 5 worms per plate.
Localization of CRTC-1::RFP was then scored as ‘all nuclear’ (all intestinal cells showed
only punctate nuclear CRTC-1), ‘some cells nuclear’ (intestinal cells showed mix of
punctate nuclear CRTC-1 and cytosolic CRTC-1) and ‘cytosolic’ (CRTC-1 was dispersed
evenly throughout nucleus and cytosol in all intestinal cells). Time = 0 was defined as when
worms were moved to fresh OP50 plates.
Transgenic strain construction
Expression constructs were based on pPD95.77 from the Fire laboratory C. elegans vector
kit. RFP in the manuscript refers to tdTOMATO, which replaced the GFP in pPD95.77.
Transgenic strains were generated via microinjection into the gonad of adult hermaphrodites
using standard techniques. Integrated transgenic lines were generated using gamma
irradiation and out-crossed to wild-type at least four times.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Calcineurin-binding mutant
QuikChange mutagenesis was used to mutate residues within the conserved calcineurinbinding site in CRTC-1. This resulted in changing the amino acid sequence (aa 423–428) as
follows. Wild type: EALDIPKLTITNAEGA; calcineurin-binding mutant:
EALDIAKATAANAEGA.
Single-worm PCR for genotyping
Single-worm lysis buffer (SWLB): 30 mM Tris pH 8.0, 8 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 0.7%
NP-40, 0.7% Tween-20. Proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 100μg ml−1 just
before use. To prepare the DNA template, one worm was added to a PCR tube containing
5μl SWLB supplemented with Proteinase K and incubated for 60 min at 60 °C. Proteinase K
was then heat-inactivated at 95 °C for 15 min before the reaction was cooled to 4 °C. To
setup the PCR reaction, 5μl of the worm lysate was used as template.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Full-length C. elegans crtc-1 and crh-1 cDNA was cloned using gateway recombination into
mammalian expression plasmid pcDNA3 containing in-frame 5′ Flag or HA tag
respectively. 293T cells were transfected using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following
manufacture’s guidelines. Primer information is available on request.
293T cells immunoprecipitation
293T cells were washed 1× with PBS and resuspended in 500 l PLB supplemented with
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Cells were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C then sonicated
to disrupt nuclei. Lysate was centrifuged at 10,000g for 30 min at 4 °C then precleared with
Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose (Santa Cruz). Cleared lysate was incubated with anti-Flag M2
affinity gel (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. For control anti-Flag M2 affinity gel was blocked
with 50 μg Flag peptide for 1 h at 4 °C then lysate was added and incubation continued
overnight at 4 °C Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed
extensively. Complexes were eluted with Flag peptide then resolved by SDS–PAGE and
transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot analysis was performed with anti-Flag
M2-Peroxidase (Sigma) and anti-HA-Peroxidase (Roche).
C. elegans immunoprecipitation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Approximately 25,000 N2 and AGD 744 animals were treated with 2 mg ml−1 Tricaine for 2
hours then, flash-frozen, then ground to fine powder using a mortar and pestle on dry ice.
Powder was collected in 400 μl cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling) supplemented with protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and sonicated to disrupt nuclei. Lysate was centrifuged at 16,000g
for 30 min at 4 °C then precleared with Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose (Santa Cruz). Cleared
lysate was incubated with EZview Red anti-Flag M2 affinity gel (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C.
Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed extensively. Complexes
were eluted with 3× Flag peptide then resolved by SDS–PAGE and transferred to
nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot analysis was performed with anti-Flag M2Peroxidase (Sigma) and anti-HA (Abcam).
In vitro kinase assay
Recombinant GST::CRTC-1 and GST proteins (2 μg) were incubated with 100 mU purified
AMPK (Millipore) in kinase reaction buffer (2.5 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mM βglycerophosphate, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM MgCl2, 150 μM AMP, 125 μM
ATP) for 30 min at 30 °C. Samples were resolved by SDS–PAGE then transferred to
nitrocellulose membrane. Phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting with
phospho-Ser 14-3-3-binding motif antibody (Cell Signaling).

Microarray procedure
Egg preparations were made using standard bleaching techniques and larval stage one (L1)
worms were synchronized by hatching eggs overnight in M9 buffer. Seven hundred and fifty
L1 larvae were seeded per 10 cm NG plate seeded with OP50. Worms were harvested for
RNA extraction when they reached L4 larval stage by snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen in
TRIzol. All L1 larvae were seeded at the same time and samples frozen at different times to
account for variation in development time between groups. Three thousand worms were
used for each sample and three biological replicates done for each experimental group: N2,
AGD383, RB1667 and crh-1 (nn3315). Biological samples were prepared on separate days,
RNA preparations were carried out at the same time (12 h before array) using TRIzol/
chloroform extraction and then run through an RNeasy cleanup column. Arrays were done
on Affymetrix C. elegans Genome Array from the same batch.

Microarray data analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Raw expression data files were obtained for three replicates each of L4 crh-1 (nn3315),
tax-6 (ok2065) and aak-2 (aa 1–321) mutants and three N2 control replicates with the
Affymetrix C. elegans Genome Array. All microarray analysis was performed with
Bioconductor33. Standard data quality validation as suggested by Affymetrix34 was carried
out with the ‘simpleaffy’ package, followed by ‘affyPLM’, which identified no problematic
chips. The raw data were preprocessed according to the GC-RMA method35 (implemented
in ‘gcrma’), which performs probe-sequence-based background adjustment, quantile
normalization, and utilizes a robust multi-chip average to summarize information into single
expression measurements for each probeset (Supplementary Table 1). Before statistical
testing, the data were submitted to a non-specific filter (via the package ‘genefilter’) that
removed probesets with an expression interquartile range smaller than 0.5. To identify genes
that were significantly differentially expressed between each mutant and the control, linear
modelling and empirical Bayes analysis was performed using the ‘limma’ package36.
Limma computes an empirical Bayes adjustment for the t-test (moderated t-statistic), which
is more robust than the standard two-sample t-test comparisons. To correct for multiple
testing, Benjamin and Hochberg’s method to control for false discovery rate was used37.
Genes with an adjusted P value of 0.05 or smaller and a fold-change in expression larger
than twofold were considered differentially expressed (Supplementary Table 2).

cAMP response element (CRE) identification
We gathered intergenic upstream sequences (up to 5 kb, from WS198) for differentially
expressed genes and used MATCH38 to search against the TRANSFAC39 CRE matrix
(M00039), an experimentally derived matrix based on 29 human CREB1-binding
sequences40. In the MATCH search we used the ‘minFP’ score cutoff, which aims to
minimize false positives. In addition, we estimated the number of such sites that can be
found by chance (background) by using the same procedure to search the upstream
sequences of ten similarly sized samples of C. elegans genes that were not affected by any
of the mutants. We used the same procedure to search against the TRANSFAC TATA
matrix (M00252)41.

Figure 1. CRTC-1 regulates longevity

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

a, CRTC-1 is the sole C. elegans CRTC family member, with conserved CREB-,
calcineurin- and 14-3-3-binding domains and nuclear export signals (NES). Conserved
AMPK phosphorylation sites are found at serines 76 and 179. b, Pcrtc-1::RFP is expressed
throughout the intestine of the worm and in neurons in the head (inset) and tail. c, RNAi
inhibition of crtc-1 and tax-6 increases C. elegans wild-type median lifespan by 53% and
60% respectively (log rank, P < 0.0001 in each case). d, Overexpressing aak-2 (aa 1–321)
increases lifespan by 37.5% (log rank, P < 0.0001). e–g, Coexpression of the
NUP-160::GFP nuclear pore complex subunit to mark the nuclear envelope (green),
CRTC-1::RFP (red) and merge (×20 magnification). e, Under well-fed conditions
CRTC-1::RFP is found throughout intestinal cells. f, g, Overnight starvation (f) or 33 °C
overnight (g) induce cytosolic translocation of CRTC-1::RFP. h, 4′,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) staining of C. elegans intestinal nuclei (×20). White arrow indicates
nucleolus. i, Confocal image of NUP-160::GFP (green) marking nuclear membrane and
CRTC-1::RFP (Red) after 33 °C overnight showing nuclear exclusion of CRTC-1::RFP after
heat stress (×100).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

a, CRTC-1::RFP (red) is excluded from the nucleus of intestinal cells when coexpressed
with a constitutively active AMPK catalytic subunit AAK-2 (aa 1–321, T181D)::GFP but
localized throughout the cell in the presence of kinase-dead AAK-2 (aa 1–321,
T181A)::GFP (×63 magnification). b, tax-6 RNAi results in nuclear exclusion of
CRTC-1::RFP (red). White arrows represent intestinal nuclei (×20). DIC, differential
interference contrast microscopy. c, Combined RNAi for the two C. elegans 14-3-3 proteins
results in nuclear localization of CRTC-1::RFP under basal conditions. White arrows
represent intestinal nuclei (×20). d, In vitro kinase assay showing that AMPK directly
phosphorylates CRTC-1. Purified rat AMPK holoenzyme was incubated with GST or
GST::CRTC-1 in the presence of AMP. Phosphorylation was detected with phospho-Ser (pSer) 14-3-3 binding motif antibody. Coomassie stained gel shows protein loaded.

Figure 3. Calcineurin and AMPK regulate lifespan through phosphorylation of CRTC-1

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

a, RNAi for crtc-1 or tax-6 has no effect in a tax-6 (ok2065) mutant background (log rank, P
= 0.28 and P = 0.73, respectively). b, Mutations to the conserved AMPK target sites serines
76 and 179 together are sufficient to retain CRTC-1::RFP in the nucleus (×10). Insets are
magnification of intestinal region. c, CRTC-1(S76A,S179A) is refractory to both tax-6
RNAi and AAK-2 overexpressor (o/e) in C. elegans intestinal cells (×40). White dashed
lines and arrows indicate nuclei. d, RNAi of tax-6 extends the lifespan of C. elegans
expressing wild-type CRTC-1::RFP (log rank, P < 0.0001), but has no effect on the S76A,
S179A double mutant (log rank, P = 0.57). There is no significant difference between the
lifespans of CRTC-1::RFP and CRTC-1(S76A,S179A) fed empty vector (log rank, P =
0.48). d, AAK-2 (aa 1–321) overexpression increases wild-type lifespan (log rank, P <
0.0001) but has no effect on worms expressing CRTC-1 (S6A, S179A) (log rank, P = 0.65).

a, Co-immunoprecipitation using lysate from a C. elegans transgenic strain (AGD744)
coexpressing 3×Flag::CRTC-1 and HA::CRH-1 showing CRTC-1 and CRH-1 interact in
vivo. b, c, CREB transcriptional reporter (pCRE::GFP) is significantly affected by RNAi of
crh-1, crtc-1 or tax-6 (two-way ANOVA, F = 18.54, P < 0.0001). Error bars represent data
± s.e.m. Control worms express GFP in head neurons and in some body tissues including
muscle, hypodermis and intestine. d, RNAi of crh-1 from larvae or adulthood extends wildtype lifespan (log rank, P < 0.001). e, RNAi of crtc-1 extends wild-type lifespan (log rank, P
< 0.001) but has no effect on crh-1 (nn3315) nulls (log rank, P = 0.53). f, Heat maps
(clustered display of expression relative to wild-type) for genes differentially expressed in
crh-1 (nn3315) nulls, tax-6 (ok2065) nulls, and aak-2 overexpressors (adjusted P value <
0.05 and fold change larger than twofold). The 22 most upregulated genes in all mutants are
expanded (full gene list available in Supplementary Material). g, Venn diagram of all
differentially expressed genes compared to wild-type in tax-6 (ok2065) nulls, aak-2
overexpressors and crh-1 (nn3315) nulls. Transcriptional profiles of aak-2 overexpressors
and tax-6 nulls are more similar to crh-1 nulls than expected by chance (one-tailed Fisher’s
exact test, P = 2.3× 10−19 and P = 1.1× 10−225, respectively). WT, wild type. h, Promoters
of differentially expressed genes are significantly enriched for CRE motifs (full bar) and
