ABSTRACT:
Overexpression of the oncogene ERG (ETS-related gene) is an adverse prognostic
factor in acute myeloid and T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (AML and T-ALL). We
hypothesize that ERG overexpression is associated with primary drug resistance
thereby influencing the outcome in leukemia. We previously reported a cell-line based
model of ERG overexpression which induced a potentially chemo-resistant spindle
shape cell type. Herein, we report a specific transcriptional gene signature for the
observed spindle shaped morphology. Genes significantly over-expressed after ERG
induction strongly resembled adhesive mesenchymal-like genes that included integrins
(ITGA10, ITGB5, ITGB3, ITGA2B), CD44, and CD24. Interestingly, the mesenchymallike signature was accompanied by the repression of DNA chromatin remodeling
and DNA repair genes, such as CHEK1, EZH2, SUZ12, and DNMT3a. The ERG-induced
mesenchymal-like signature positively correlated with TMPRSS2-ERG prostate tissues
and invasive breast cancer mRNA expression datasets reflecting a general ERG-driven
pattern of malignancy. Furthermore, inhibitors modulating ERG druggable pathways
WNT, PKC, and AKT, and chemotherapeutic agent cytarabine revealed ERG-induced
drug resistance. In particular, PKC412 treatment enhanced proliferative rates and
promoted spindle shape formation in ERG-induced cells. Nilotinib and dasatinib were
effective at abolishing ERG-induced cells. Moreover, ERG overexpression also led
to an increase in double strand breaks. This report provides mechanistic clues into
ERG-driven drug resistance in the poor prognostic group of high ERG expressers,
provides insight to improved drug targeted therapies, and provides novel markers
for a mesenchymal-like state in acute leukemia.

INTRODUCTION

TMPRSS2-ERG[5,6] in prostate cancers are predictive of
poor prognosis. Likewise, high levels of ERG correlate
with a worse outcome in cytogenetically normal AML
and acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)[7,8]. Mouse
models overexpressing Erg clearly revealed an oncogenic
phenotype, with high Erg causing fetal hematopoietic
progenitors to develop leukemia[2]. Similarly, high ERG
expressing bone marrow cells transplanted in adult mice
produced Notch1 mutations and T cell expansion[9].
Recently it was reported that about 30% of transgenic

The oncogene ERG belongs to an evolutionary
related group of ETS DNA binding proteins and directs
gene expression in hematopoietic processes establishing
definitive hematopoiesis, maintaining the stem cell
pool[1] and promoting megakaryocytic differentiation[2].

ERG mouse models develop T-ALL[10] whereas the
remainder develop myeloid leukemia at five months[11].
Current chemotherapy regimens are insufficient for
high-risk acute leukemia patients characterized by high
ERG expression. For instance, in AML, the cumulative
incidence of relapse in high ERG expressers was 81%,
in comparison to only 33% in low ERG expressers at
5-years[7]. Similarly, the overall survival of high ERG
expressers in T-ALL at 5 year years is only 26% versus
58% in low ERG expressers[8]. Thus, understanding the
ERG gene regulatory networks responsible for treatment
failure and involved in drug resistance at the molecular
level will aid in understanding the etiology of high ERG
expression in acute leukemia.
Due to the high incidence of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion
in prostate cancer, recent studies have mainly focused
on mapping ERG signaling networks in prostate. These
networks comprise a diaspora of functions that show a role
for ERG in the regulation of extracellular matrix through
the plasminogen activator pathway[12], upregulation of
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes[13],
ERG-mediated regulation of chromatin though binding to
the EZH2 promoter, and DNA repair regulation through
poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) interactions[14].
This composite ERG gene signatures correlates well
with the clinical characteristics of prostate cancer, and is
thought to contribute to disease progression in prostate
cancer[15,16].
While it is unarguable that ERG overexpression
is involved in oncogenesis of leukemia and prostate
cancers, much less is clear as to how ERG signaling
mediates drug resistance. Emerging reports describe
EMT in tumor progression as a mechanism for cell
proliferative and survival advantages[17]. EMT is defined
as an epithelial cell undergoing transformation, acquiring
mesenchymal-like features that allow a cell to be motile
and able to migrate. This process requires specific
changes in gene regulation and is remarkably reversible
(termed mesenchyme-to-epithelial, MET) via epigenetic
changes[18]. Moreover, the acquisition of mesenchymelike (derived from MET) properties in both malignant
cells and non-epithelial cells has been proposed as a
mechanism for drug resistance in solid tumors of the lung,
breast, prostate[18] and in chronic myeloid leukemia[17].
Several ETS transcription factors have been implicated in
turning on an EMT-like program and, likewise, studies in
cancer cells document enhanced cell migration in EMT
overexpressing cells[19,20]. Taken together, these studies
support the notion that EMT in high ERG expressers
may contribute to drug resistance in prostate carcinoma.
Herein, we report that in leukemia, ERG overexpression
causes molecular characteristics that are strikingly similar
to the ERG-associated signaling networks in prostate
cancer. ERG overexpression induces a mesenchymal-like
state with a highly drug resistant phenotype, pronounced

proliferative growth advantage, and promotes double
strand breaks (DSBs) formation. Our findings may have
important clinical implications for the improvement of
current therapies in adult leukemia.

RESULTS
ERG induction promotes mesenchymal-like gene
expression signature accompanied by repression
of DNA remodeling and DNA repair
We previously reported that prolonged ERG
overexpression induced leukemia cells to adhere and
develop bi-directional protrusions (spindle shaped cells)
(Fig. 1A). This morphogenic state was in part attributable
to the upreguation of WNT11[21]. However the overall
transcriptional program for this morphogenesis had
not been characterized (Fig 1A). Herein, we sought to
elucidate the morphogenesis program responsible for
the spindle shape formation upon ERG induction by
determining the global transcription profile of leukemic
K562 cells harbouring tet-on inducible ERG expression
constructs. When comparing global gene expression of
ERG-induced cells versus non-induced cells, 128 genes
were differentially over-expressed whereas 1440 were
differentially under-expressed (Figure 1B, fold change
≥2; p<0.05). Through Gene Ontology (GO) analyses, the
over-expressed genes were significantly enriched for cell
adhesion, migration, and motility (Table 1, top), a pattern
that highly resembled the adhesive EMT properties and
included integrin upregulation. We verified by PCR
upregulation of gene products associated with biological
adhesion and morphogenesis including: CD24, CD44,
ITGA10, PLAUR, CXCL11, SELP, TYROBP, FLT4,
and SHANK3 (Figure 1C). While the EMT/MET genetic
program has yet to be fully understood in cancer, recent
studies showed that upregulation of two novel EMT key
markers, CD44 and CD24, are necessary for entry into
a mesenchymal-like state in highly drug resistant breast
HER2 positive carcinoma[25]. Contrary to typical EMT/
MET, the EMT markers E- and N-cadherin were not
differentially altered by ERG overexpression, suggesting
that the EMT/MET gene signature may be different in
leukemia than in breast cancer. NUMB, both a binding
target of ERG[26] and reported to be involved in EMT
regulation[27], was also under-expressed (Figure 1C).
Additional ERG under-expressed genes were enriched for
the GO term “DNA homologous recombination and repair”
including the CHEK1, ATM, and BRCA1 DNA repair
genes (Table 1, bottom). DNA chromatin remodeling
proteins, such as EZH2, SUZ12, and DNMT3a, were
also under-expressed (Figure 1C), as observed in prostate
cancer studies[14,28]. Hence, repression of DNA repair

352

and DNA chromatin remodeling genes may provide a
link to the molecular mechanisms through which ERG
overexpressing cells induce a mesenchymal-like state.
We then used Oncomine, a microarray cancer
database, to assess whether ERG-induced gene signature
generated from the K562 pTRE-ERG leukemia cell line

was disease-relevant. 128 over-expressed genes were
uploaded to Oncomine platform. ERG-induced gene
signature positively correlated with three invasive and
metastatic cancer mRNA expression datasets: 1) Grasso
dataset prostate tissues habouring ERG rearrangement
versus no ERG rearrangement[29], 2) Grasso dataset
of prostate carcinoma tissues versus normal prostate
gland[29] and 3) Stickeler dataset of invasive breast
cancer patients treated with a standard regimen of
chemotherapy assessing post-chemotherapy versus pretreatment changes[30] (Supplement Figure 1A-D and
Supplement Table 1). Of note, in the latter dataset, 17
of 25 patients with invasive breast cancer did not result
in complete remission indicating that the analysis of
transcriptionally deregulated genes could aid in predicting
the clinical response to cancer treatment. Recent studies
in a prostate cell line over-expressing ERG also concur
with our results, i.e. they exhibit highly enriched cell
adhesion and cell migration GO terms[31] and promote
EMT gene expression[32], thus providing further support
for an ERG-driven mesenchymal-like state in leukemia.
Taken together, the positive correlation of ERG-induced
mesenchymal-like gene signature in leukemia with solid
tumor prostate cancer tissues demonstrate that an ERGspecific gene signature is induced, which is independent
of disease origin, and may provide sensitive molecular
targets of prognostic value, thereby aiding in predicting
the outcome or response to therapy.

ERG overexpression results in a profound
apoptotic resistance
Recently, we reported that ERG overexpression
conferred resistance to the multi-kinase inhibitors TKI258
and sorafinib[26]. A panel of 15 drugs was selected to
further explore the ERG-driven drug resistance. From
our own studies in leukemia cells and previous reports
in prostate cancer genes, we selected the ERG-targeted
networks to include: WNT signaling[21], AKT/PI3K
signalling[26,33], ERK[34], DNA repair[35], and DNA
chromatin remodeling (Table 2)[36]. ERG-induced
drug resistance was determined by three criteria: 1) the
significant difference in apoptotic induction in noninduced cells in comparison with ERG-induced cells,
2) the maintenance or expansion of ERG-induced cells
(DsRed positive and absence of apoptosis), 3) by the
persistence of spindle shape cells upon drug treatment
(Table 2). Under those conditions, ERG-induced cells were
considered resistant to the following agents: LY294002,
rapamycin, quercetin, PKC412, cytarabine (Ara-C), ICG001, and TKI258 as previously determined[26] (Figure
2A, upper panel). Remarkably, ERG-induced cells were
not only resilient to apoptosis when treated with Ara-C,
LY294002, or PKC412 but also displayed sustained
DsRed population upon Ara-C treatment and expansion

treatment (Figure 2A, lower panel). Moreover, treatment

enhanced spindle shape formation (Table 2). Conversely,

The lack of 3-deazaneplanocin A (EZH2 inhibitor)
[36] and AZD2281 (PARP inhibitor)[37] effectiveness
in ERG-induced cells may be due to repression of the
drug targets EZH2 and CHEK1. We conclude that ERGinduced cells are resistant to Ara-C, WNT inhibitors, drugs
targeting the protein kinase C pathway (PKC412) and
downstream effectors: i.e. the PI3K inhibitors LY294002
and rapamycin. Thus, PKC kinase inhibitors, WNT
inhibitors and Ara-C are predicted not to be effective
in clearing ERG overexpressing cells in leukemia. By
contrast, nilotinib is expected to reverse drug resistance,
by selectively enhancing apoptosis most potently in cell
model system overexpressing ERG.

contact of stroma mesenchymal cells with ERG-induced
cells from three AML donors, which confirmed a similar
rapid decay rate of CFSE, as observed with the HS-5 coculture. These results demonstrate a synergistic interaction
between ERG overexpressing cells and the contacting
HS-5 stroma, or primary AML MSC.
We also investigated ERG-overexpressing cells
treated with PKC412, to test the effect of drug resistance
in the presence of HS-5 and AML MSCs. Untreated ERG
DsRed positive cells were expanded in the presence
of HS-5 (10%) but not in the presence of AML MSCs.
However, ERG-induced cells (DsRed positive) treated
with PKC412 expanded by 40% in co-culture with HS-5
and 20% with AML MSCs (Figure 2C). Thus, ERGdependent resistance to apoptotic induction was enhanced
via stroma protection through cell-to-cell contacts upon
PKC412 treatment, in comparison with 80% apoptotic
induction in non-induced cells.

ERG overexpressing cells cultured on primary
AML-derived stroma have a proliferative growth
advantage
Given the survival properties of ERG
overexpression, we examined the proliferative properties
of ERG-induced cells. CFSE labeled ERG-induced
cells displayed a 2-fold proliferative advantage over
non-induced cells at 72-hours (Figure 2B). Proliferative
growth was further enhanced by PKC412 treatment in
ERG-induced cells over non-induced cells, and treatment
with Ara-C resulted in minimal advantage over the noninduced group. To further monitor this proliferative
advantage, co-cultured ERG-induced cells were harvested
in direct contact with the HS-5 stromal layer. Also in this
case, ERG-induced cells manifested a 2-fold greater rate
of proliferation than cells cultured without stroma (Figure
2B). We further tested the proliferative effect of the direct

Blocking CD44 by antibody binding inhibits
ERG-induced spindle shape morphology
Due to the enhanced survival of ERG-induced
cells, we sought to identify potential adhesion molecules
induced by ERG overexpression that would regulate
cell-to-cell contacts. A key regulator of mesenchymallike properties is CD44, a major adhesion molecule for
homing, cell migration, and signal transduction[18].
Deregulated CD44 contributes to leukemogenesis, and
blocking CD44-mediated adhesion by complexing
antibodies to aid in the detachment of leukemia cells from
the bone marrow niche has been proposed as a targeted
355

Oncotarget

therapy in leukemia[38]. CD44 was significantly overexpressed (2-fold) in the ERG-induced clones. Therefore,
we tested a CD44 blocking antibody in culture with

ERG-induced and non-induced cells (Figure 3A and
3B). Addition of a CD44 blocking antibody completely
abrogated the spindle shape formation in ERG-induced
cells, whereas IgG alone did not elicit any morphological
changes. ERG-induced cells were then treated with
PKC412 to enhance spindle shape formation. In this
case, antibody blocking of CD44 inhibited spindle shape
formation and reduced cell adhesion by 75%, whereas
IgG antibody had no effect. Thus, ERG-induced spindle
shape formation is mediated by CD44. We also measured
apoptosis to determine the effect of CD44 block on ERGinduced cells. Only marginal changes in apoptosis (Figure
2A) were observed, affirming that CD44’s main function
is to aid cell-to-cell adhesion of in ERG-induced cells.
Thus, disruption of ERG-mediated adhesion via a CD44
block may be of therapeutic significance in combination
with current treatment protocols.

Overexpression of ERG involves ERK 1/2
phosphorylation
Current evidence supports the notion that, in cancer,
MET (as opposed to EMT) is turned on in malignant cells
to promote cell proliferation, migration, and evasion from
apoptosis[18]. Genome-wide studies demonstrated that
ERG activates the RAS/ERK pathway in a transgenic
ERG leukemic model[11], and regulates cell migration in
prostate cells[34]. Therefore, we sought to determine if
ERG overexpression affected the phosphorylation levels
of ERK1/2. Potent ERG overexpression induced higher
pan ERK levels compared to non-induced cells, and the
effect was enhanced with PKC412 and Ara-C treatment
(Figure 4). Endogenous levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2
in ERG-induced cells were also elevated (including with
Ara-C treatment), whereas no differences were observed
in cells treated with PKC412. The lack of phosphorylation
changes in ERK1/2 in cells treated with PKC412 suggests
that other residues may be phosphorylated to enhance
ERK signal transduction in ERG-induced cells. The
upregulated levels of pan and phosphorylated ERK1/2
in ERG-induced cells indicate that signaling is upstream
leading to adhesion and resistance to PKC412 and Ara-C
treatment.

Overexpression of ERG generates genomic
instability
Due to the severe downregulation of DNA repair
gene expression in ERG overexpressing cells (Table
1) and in prostate cancer studies[14], we examined
ERG overexpressing cells for the presence of DSBs by
performing a neutral comet assay[24], with and without
Ara-C or PKC412 treatments. The percentage of DNA
in the comet tail reflects the number of DSBs. Noninduced cells displayed, on average, 30% tail DNA,
356

Oncotarget

whereas ERG-induced cells harbored a significant greater
amount (45-50%) (Figure 5). Treatment of non-induced
cells with Ara-C or PKC412 increased the percent
tail DNA, as expected, to 50% compared to untreated
controls. However, ERG-induced cells treated with the
cytotoxic drugs showed a significant reduction of DSBs
(10% tail DNA with Ara-C and 30% with PKC412). We

attribute the reduction of % tail DNA in ERG-induced
cells treated with PKC412 to the activation of alternate
DNA repair mechanisms, such as non-homologous endjoining, possibly to sustain high DNA replication rates
(proliferative growth). Taken together, our data indicate
that upon ERG induction, the oncogene generates
increased DNA damage (DSBs) and that the effect may
be reversed by treatment with Ara-C and PKC412.
These observations complement the observed expansion
of DsRed in ERG-induced cells and the enhanced
proliferative rate in the presence of PKC412 (Figure 2A
and B). Hence, aberrant DNA repair may contribute to
the multifactorial drug-mediated resistance in high ERG
expressers in leukemia.

DISCUSSION
Herein we show that in leukemia cells ERG
overexpression promotes a mesenchymal-like gene
expression signature that includes: CD24, CD44, ITGA10,
ITGB5, ITGB3, ITGA2B and the morphogenic-associated
genes, such as SHANK3, TYROBP. These results are
in line with the positive correlation of ERG-induced
mesenchymal-like gene signature in leukemia with
prostate carcinoma and chemotherapy-treated invasive
breast tissues that validated our model system. We propose
that, irrespective of cell type, high ERG expressing

chemotherapeutic agents.
Through fluorescent tracking, we have also
demonstrated that ERG overexpression in leukemia cells
confers proliferative growth advantage at twice the rate
of non-induced cells, whilst mediating the development
of spindle shape morphology. In our stable phenotypic
model of ERG overexpression, these proliferative features
allowed for an even greater ERG-induced cell expansion
in co-culture with the cell line HS-5 and in co-culture with
primary bone marrow derived stroma from AML. Thus,
enhanced adhesion of ERG overexpressing cells to the
stromal bed may exploit direct interactions with stroma
cells in order to increase cell survival. In the presence
of cytotoxic drugs, the percentage of ERG-induced cells
treated with PKC412 was enhanced, although the rates of

proliferation were not altered (data not shown). In addition
the drug resistance promoted directly by ERG, stroma may
provide additional apoptotic protection from cytotoxic
drugs.
ERG-induced leukemia cells treated with other PKC
or WNT targeting drugs, such as LY294002, rapamycin
and ICG-001, promoted expansion of ERG-induced
cells rather than inducing apoptosis. This indicates that
apoptotic evasion is another feature of ERG-induced
survival, particularly under cytotoxic stress, possibly
through the inhibition of PKC or WNT signaling
pathways. Hence, it seems unlikely that targeted therapy
through these drugs will benefit high ERG expressers.
Conversely, nilotinib, PD325901, 5-azacytidine, dasatanib,
were effective at depleting DsRed ERG positive cells. Of
the agents screened, nilotinib induced apoptosis most
effectively in ERG-induced cells.
Our treatment with a CD44 blocking antibody
completely abrogated the spindle shape phenotype, with
minimal apoptotic effects. Due to antigen specificity,
blocking monoclonal antibodies have proven to be
effective when combined with chemotherapy, such as
rituximab for B-Cell lymphoma, trastuzumab for HER2positive cancer, cetuximab for colorectal carcinoma, and
alemtuzumab for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. CD44, in
particular, is believed to prevent homing of leukemia stem
cells to the bone marrow, thus representing an attractive
target for AML therapy[38]. This approach may also be
applicable to the subgroup of high ERG expressers in
AML in conjunction with other effective drug therapies,
such as nilotinib.
The acquisition of drug resistance though activation
of ERK1/2 is a common feature of oncogenes. ERK1/2 and
downstream targets are regulated by ERG overexpression
in the normal prostate cell line RWPE-1 through the ERG
target PLAU[34]. Our results concur with these studies,
since ERG overexpression resulted in greater amounts of
phosphorylated ERK1/2 than in non-induced cells. ERGinduced cells treated with PKC412 led to an increase of
pan ERK levels. Surprisingly, phosphorylated levels of
pT202/Y204 were not detected, despite the remarkable
expansion of ERG-induced cells and the enhanced
spindle morphology. Thus, it is possible that either
shunting to a different pathway branch occurred, or that
phosphorylation took place at different ERK residues that
were not recognized by the Y202/T204 antibody. That
activation of the ERK1/2 pathway constitutes a critical
step in the acquisition of drug resistance in ERG-induced
cells is upstream, is further supported by our data with
Ara-C, which revealed diminishing levels of ERK1/2
phosphorylation.
In prostate cancer, genomic mutations of DNA
repair-associated genes, such as polymerase iota, were
positively correlated with TMPRSS2-ERG positive
tumors[39], which associates ERG overexpression with
the DNA damage response. In ERG positive cells, the

instability and enhanced DNA repair in the presence of
Ara-C and PKC412. ERG-induced (+ERG) and non-induced

and then analyzed by the neutral comet assay to detect the extent
of DNA double strand breaks. A) Representative agarose smears

respectively), non-induced cells treated with Ara-C (n=63),
ERG-induced cells treated with Ara-C (n=62), non-induced cells
treated with PKC412 (n=48), and ERG-induced cells treated
with PKC412 (n=63). Statistical tests were performed using oneway ANOVA (Tukey test for multiple comparisons).

DNA repair genes PARP and DNA-PKs were also reported
to co-immunoprecipitate with ERG. Likewise, inhibitors
of PARP and DNA-PKs were found to impinge on ERG
function, since the inhibitor olaparib (AZD2281) had no
effect on ERG-mediated cellular proliferation but blocked
ERG-mediated cell invasion[37]. In our current study,
AZD2281 treatment did not affect apoptotic levels in
ERG positive cells but blocked spindle shape formation.
We also observed increased levels of DSB in ERGinduced leukemia cells, as previously reported in prostate
cancer cell lines[14]. Also, in our leukemia model, ERG
under-expressed genes included ATM, CHEK1 and
ATR, which are key genes in the initiation of homologydependent DNA repair. Surprisingly, addition of PKC412
elicited a remarkable lessening in genomic instability
in ERG-induced cells, suggesting either a restoration in
DNA repair gene expression or a shift from homologous
recombination to other types of DNA repair, including non
homologous end joining (NHEJ). The latter hypothesis
is supported by ERG-induced XRCC5, a key NHEJassociated gene and significantly ranked with high ERG
levels in prostate mRNA expression datasets (Supplement
Figure 1A and 1C). Hence, it is possible that a shift from
homologous recombination to a NHEJ pathway of DNA
repair may contribute to the escape from apoptosis and
drug resistance. Further studies would be required to
determine the precise repair processes coordinated by
ERG in leukemia.
In conclusion, our K562 ERG-induced cell model
system unraveled an ERG mesenchymal-like gene
signature that overrides disease entities and reflects a
general pattern of ERG-driven malignancies. We highlight,
a number of changes in gene transcription in key pathways
responsible for drug resistance, and provide novel targets
for further validation and development in order to achieve
custom tailored treatment strategies for the high ERG
subgroup of leukemia.

(Selleck Chemicals, 10 µM), daunorubicin (Pfizer, 10
nM), nilotinib and dasatinib (Bug laboratory, Frankfurt
Germany, 10 nM), olaparib (AZD22811, Selleck
Chemicals, 10 µM), LY294002 (Cayman Chemical, 10

ICG001 (Selleck Chemical, 10 µM), XAV393 (Sigma, 10
µM), and 5-azacytidine (Sigma, 1 µM). Dose curves were
determined by Water Soluable Tetrazolium salt (WST) cell
viability assays to determine near IC50 concentrations for
each drug in K562 cells.
For co-culture experiments, the HS-5 stroma
original cell line was purchased from ATCC and grown in
20% FCS RPMI to 80% confluence. Stromal layers were
seeded one day prior to co-culture. ERG-inducible cells
were stimulated for an additional 24 hours with DOX and
combined with HS-5 stroma in 10% FCS RPMI for an
additional 24 hour period before the addition of drugs.
ERG-inducible cells and stroma were then co-cultured for
an additional 4 days with and without DOX to allow cell
morphology changes to take place.
For the counting of spindle shaped cells, K562
pTRE-ERG CL9 and CL46 cells were seeded onto culture
dishes with 2 mm grid plates and stimulated with DOX
for six days. Two independent experiments with blind
labels in duplicate were performed for each experimental
group. Rabbit monoclonal anti-CD44 (H-CAM, Millipore)
and anti-mouse IgG (Cell Signaling) were used in cell
adhesion experiments at 1:500 dilution.

Microarray expression and bioinformatic analyses
Three independent stably transfected clones (CL4,
CL9, CL46) of K562 pTRE-ERG cells were grown in
the presence and absence of DOX (ERG-induced and
non-induced) for long-term culture (8 days). Total RNA
was extracted from ERG-induced and non-induced cells
and hybridized using Affymetrix U133-plus chip. Data
analysis was performed with Gene Spring 4.2 (Agilent
Technologies). Differential expression of genes from
biological triplicates (CL4, CL9, CL46) that displayed an
over- and under-expression of 2-fold or greater between
ERG-induced and non-induced cells were used for further
analysis. Microarray data have been deposited in the Gene
Expression Omnibus Database. To determine enriched
biological terms, over- and under-expressed candidate
gene lists were uploaded to the DAVID Bioinformatics
server (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov), which was
employed to group and define enriched gene ontology
terms[22].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and drug treatment
Cultures of K562 pTRE-ERG doxycycline (DOX)
inducible clones were grown in 10% FCS RPMI and
seeded at 1x105 cells/ml, as previously described[21].
K562 pTRE-ERG cells were stimulated with DOX
(1 µg/ml) for 24 hours. Following this step, drug was
administered in the presence and absence of DOX in
two K562 pTRE-ERG clones (CL9 and CL46) for an
additional 96 hours. Drug (company, concentration ranges)
used in this study are as follows: TKI258 (Novartis, 10
µM), PKC412 (LC Laboratories, 10 µM), rapamycin
(LC Laboratories, 10 µM), cytarabine (Cell Pharm,
20 µg/ml), quercetin (Sigma, 10 µM), PD0325901

org). Co-expression of ERG over-expressed and underexpressed genes were compared with leukemia, breast and
prostate datasets which were obtained directly through the
Oncomine 3.0 software.

Double strand DNA breakage was measured
through the neutral comet assay[24]. ERG-induced cells
were stimulated with DOX for 24 hours prior to the
addition of Ara-C or PKC412. Following a 72-hour drug
treatment, 1x105 cells were suspended into melted 1%
agarose (1:10 dilution) and smeared onto a precoated 1%
agarose glass slide. Slides were then submerged into lysis
buffer (2.5 M NaCl, 0.1 M EDTA, 10 mM Tris pH7.5,
1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium lauryl sarcosine, 0.5 mg/
ml proteinase K) overnight at 4˚C. Slides were rinsed
in TE buffer, equilibrated in an electrophoresis chamber
with neutral electrophoresis buffer for 30 minutes and then
electrophoresis was conducted for 25 minutes at 25 volts.
Slides were then submerged in distilled water, stained with
4’,6-diamidine-2-phenylindol dihydrochloride (DAPI, 1.4
µM), fixed in 70% ethanol and air dried. Experiments
were conducted in duplicate, in both CL9 and CL46
clones, with four to five 100x magnification images for
each treatment. The fluorescence intensities of the comet
head and comet tail of all cells (63 to 110) in each image
were scored. Percent DNA in tail and head: the total
fluorescence intensity within the delineated comet tail
was divided by the total comet intensity (comet head plus
comet tail intensity) and multiplied by 100. Measurements
were conducted with the Image J software and Comet Tail
analysis plugin (rsbweb.nih.gov/IJ).

Quantitative RT PCR
Quantitative RT PCR was conducted with Sybr
green master mix (Fermentas) and analyses were
conducted as previously described[21]. Relative mRNA
expression was plotted as fold changes relative to uninduced cells from two independent pTRE-ERG CL9 and
CL46 clones.

Patient material
To harvest mesenchymal stroma cells, the
mononuclear fraction of bone marrow was cultured as
previously described[23]. Informed consent of patient
material was carried out according to the Declaration of
Helsinki.

Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry
Live ERG-inducible adherent cells were
stained with primary rabbit polyclonal anti-WNT11
(Novus Biologicals) and secondary anti-rabbit IgG
(Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated) antibodies. Annexin
V-FITC (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) staining was
carried out according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester, CFSE
(Cayman Chemical) was used at 1:400 dilution and
staining was conducted according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
To capture endogenous levels of pan ERK and ERK
(pT202/pY204), ERG-induced cells were DOX stimulated
for three days followed by 24-hour drug treatment (Ara-C
or PKC412). Briefly, for intracellular staining, K562
pTRE-ERG cells (5x105 cells/ml) were fixed with 150 µl
Phosflow fix buffer I (BD biosciences) at 37˚C, washed
with PBS, resuspended in 200 µl cold methanol for 10
min, blocked by PBS with 1% BSA, and labeled with the
primary antibody (1:100 dilution) for 15min at 4˚C. To
detect endogenous ERK levels the α-mouse pan ERK and
phospho Alexa α-mouse 647 (pT202/pY204) antibodies
were used. When required, secondary antibody, antimouse IgG (Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated), was used for
labeling. The three antibodies were purchased from Cell
Signaling (Davers, MA). The labeled cells were measured
by flow cytometry and analysed using Flowjo software.
All flow cytometry techniques were conducted on a
Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur instrument.
