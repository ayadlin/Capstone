Abstract
Pluripotent cells within embryonal carcinoma (EC) can
differentiate in vivo or in vitro on treatment with specific
agents. Differentiating EC cells express lower levels of stem
cell–related genes, such as Cripto-1. We show that migration
of human EC cells (NTERA/2 and NCCIT) can be reduced
following treatment with the guidance molecule Netrin-1.
Moreover, Netrin-1 treatment increased the levels of B-III
tubulin, glial filament acidic protein, Nestin, and ;-aminobutyric acid and reduced the expressions of Cripto-1, Nanog,
and Oct4 in EC cells. These Netrin-1–induced effects in the EC
cells were mediated via binding of Netrin-1 to the Neogenin
receptor and activation of SHP-2, resulting in increased levels
of inactive phosphorylated c-src(Y527). These results suggest
that Netrin-1 can induce neuroectodermal-like differentiation
of human EC cells by affecting c-src signaling via SHP-2
activation and regulation of Nanog, Oct4, and Cripto-1
expressions. [Cancer Res 2009;69(5):1717–21]

Introduction
Embryonal carcinoma (EC) is a germ-line tumor consisting of
cells that can be induced to differentiate with agents, such as
retinoic acid (1). The malignant phenotype of EC cells can be
reversed when injected into the mouse blastocyst and become
incorporated into normally developing embryonic tissues (2).
Transcription factors, such as Oct4 and Nanog, which regulate
self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem (ES) cells (3), are
expressed in EC cells (4, 5), suggesting that these transcription
factors could also regulate pluripotency in EC cells. Cripto-1, an
epidermal growth factor family member and target gene of Oct4
and Nanog, is expressed in ES cells and during the initial stages of
development (6). Cripto-1, also known as teratocarcinoma-derived
growth factor-1 since first isolated from human NTERA/2 EC cells
(7), can induce cellular transformation in vitro and increase tumor
incidence in vivo (6). Interestingly, repression of Cripto-1 is
associated with differentiation of EC cells toward a neuroectodermal lineage (7). However, little information is known about
how external factors, such as guidance molecules, may regulate the
levels of Nanog and/or Oct4 and result in the differentiation of
cancer cells with pluripotent characteristics.

Netrin-1, a secreted guidance molecule, can bind to specific cell
surface receptors and regulate the development, functional
differentiation, and trafficking of both neuronal and extraneuronal
cells (8). Netrin-1 can also regulate Cripto-1–induced cellular
motility and allometric outgrowth of mouse mammary epithelial
cells (9). Recently, it has been shown that Netrin-1 can cause a
reduction in the expression of Nanog and Cripto-1 and can increase
expression of h-III tubulin in mouse ES cells, suggesting that
Netrin-1 may affect early neuroectodermal differentiation in
pluripotent cells (10).
Here, we investigate the effect of Netrin-1 on human EC cells.
Exogenous soluble Netrin-1 was able to reduce migration and
induce increased levels of markers of early neuroectodermal
differentiation in NTERA/2 and NCCIT EC cells. These responses
to Netrin-1 were accompanied by increased levels of active
phosphorylated SHP-2 (P-SHP-2) and inactive phosphorylated
c-src(Y527) [P-c-src(Y527)]. Furthermore, Netrin-1–treated EC cells
showed reduced levels of Cripto-1, Nanog, and Oct4. These results
suggest that Netrin-1 can regulate differentiation in human EC cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, recombinant proteins, migration, and proliferation
assays. Human NTERA/2 and NCCIT EC cells were grown either in McCoy’s
5A medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS; NTERA/2) or in
DMEM containing 10% FBS (NCCIT) and cultured at 37jC in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2. Recombinant Netrin-1 protein was purchased from
R&D Systems. Migration and cell proliferation assays were performed as
previously described (11). The experiments were performed in triplicate and
repeated twice.
Western blot analysis. The human EC cells were seeded in 60-mm
plates (6  105 per plate), serum starved overnight, and then treated with
medium alone (control) or with 50 ng/mL of exogenous soluble Netrin-1 for
30 min. For inhibitor studies, the cells were pretreated for 16 h with either
medium alone (control) or anti-Neogenin blocking antibody (1 Ag/mL;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology; ref. 12) and for 3 h with either medium alone
(control) or SHP-2 inhibitor [50 Amol/L, 8-hydroxy-7-(6-sulfo-2-naphthylazo)-5-quinolinesulfonic acid disodium salt; Acros Organics] followed by
stimulation with 50 ng/mL of exogenous soluble Netrin-1 for 30 min.
Protein extraction and Western blot analysis were performed as described
previously (11). The following primary antibodies were used: mouse antiCripto-1 (1:500; Rockland); rabbit anti-Neogenin (1:1,000; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology); rabbit anti-h-III tubulin (1:1,000; Abcam); mouse antiNestin (1:1,000; R&D Systems); rabbit anti-SHP-2, anti-P-SHP-2(Y542), antiP-c-src(Y416), and anti-P-c-src(Y527) (1:1,000; Cell Signaling); mouse anti-glial
filament acidic protein (GFAP; 1:1,000; Chemicon); mouse anti-src (1:500;
Upstate-Millipore); and mouse anti-actin (1:20,000; Sigma). Densitometric
analysis of Western blot results was performed with the NIH Image
program.4

Quantitative real-time PCR. EC cells were plated at a density of
6  105 in 60-mm plates and serum starved for 24 h. The cells were then
stimulated with exogenous soluble Netrin-1 at different concentrations for
30 min. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed on Stratagene
MX3000P using Brilliant II SYBR Green QPCR master mix (Stratagene).
The following primers were used: hGAPDH, 5¶-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3¶ (reverse);
hCripto-1, 5¶-CACGATGTGCGCAAAGAGA-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-TGACCGTGCCAGCATTTACA-3¶ (reverse); hNanog, 5¶-TGAACCTCAGCTACAAACAGGTG-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-AACTGCATGCAGGACTGCAGAG-3¶ (reverse);

was performed using the C t method, as previously shown (11).
Immunofluorescence. EC cells were treated for 48 to 72 h with either
medium alone (control) or 50 ng/mL of exogenous soluble Netrin-1. Cells
were incubated for 16 h at 4jC with the following primary antibodies: rabbit
anti-g-aminobutyric acid (GABA; 1:1,000; Chemicon), rabbit anti-h-III tubulin
(1:1,000), mouse anti-Nestin (1:1,000), and mouse anti-GFAP (1:1,000). Cells
were processed for immunofluorescent staining as previously described (9).
Statistical analysis. The statistical significance of the various groups in
the different experiments was calculated with the nonparametric MannWhitney U test. Statistical tests were two sided and data were considered
statistically significant with P < 0.05.

Results and Discussion
Netrin-1 reduces migration and expression of Cripto-1,
Nanog, and Oct4 in NTERA/2 and NCCIT human EC cells.
Because the expression of Netrin-1 in human EC cells is unknown,

we determined whether it would be expressed in NTERA/2 or
NCCIT EC cells. In our study, we could not detect Netrin-1 protein
by Western blot in either NTERA/2 or NCCIT EC cells (data not
shown). However, the addition of 50 ng/mL of exogenous soluble
Netrin-1 significantly reduced (P < 0.05) the migration of NTERA/2
and NCCIT EC cells compared with untreated control EC cells
(Fig. 1A). Netrin-1 did not significantly affect the 72-hour growth
rates of either NTERA/2 or NCCIT EC cells (Fig. 1B), suggesting that
Netrin-1 did not reduce migration by inhibiting proliferation in the
EC cells. A reduction in Cripto-1 levels can lead to lower migratory
rates in Cripto-1–expressing cells (9, 11); therefore, we determined
whether Netrin-1 treatment could affect Cripto-1 levels in NTERA/2
and NCCIT EC cells. Western blot and qRT-PCR analysis show a
significant reduction in Cripto-1 protein and mRNA levels (P < 0.05)
in Netrin-1–treated NTERA/2 and NCCIT EC cells compared with
untreated controls (Fig. 1C). Because Cripto-1 is a target gene of the
stem cell–related transcription factors Oct4 and Nanog (13), we
investigated whether Netrin-1 could affect the expressions of Oct4
and/or Nanog in NTERA/2 and NCCIT EC cells. Exogenous soluble
Netrin-1 significantly reduced (P < 0.05) Oct4 and Nanog mRNA
expression in NTERA/2 and NCCIT cells (Fig. 1D). This agrees with
similar observations that describe reduced Nanog and Cripto-1
levels in Netrin-1–treated mouse ES cells (10).
NTERA/2 and NCCIT EC cells assume early neuronal-like
characteristics when treated with Netrin-1. Exogenous agents,
such as retinoic acid, can induce neuronal-like features in EC cells
(1). We investigated whether the effect of Netrin-1 on Cripto-1,
Nanog, and Oct4 expression might be associated with differentiation of NTERA/2 and NCCIT EC cells. Western blot analysis
shows that 12-day treatment of NTERA/2 or NCCIT EC cells with

Netrin-1 Differentiates Human Embryonal Carcinoma Cells

Figure 2. A, Western blot analysis shows increased
expression of h-III tubulin in NTERA/2 and NCCIT EC
cells treated for 12 d with exogenous soluble Netrin-1
(50 ng/mL). B, Western blot analysis shows increased
expression of GFAP and Nestin in Netrin-1–treated
NTERA/2 EC cells. Increased expression of h-III
tubulin in Netrin-1–treated NTERA/2 EC cells was also
detected by immunofluorescent staining. Of note is the
neuronal-like morphology with axonal/dendritic-like
cellular extensions (white arrows ) in Netrin-1–treated
NTERA/2 EC cells. C, immunofluorescent staining
shows increased GFAP and GABA expressions in
Netrin-1–treated NTERA/2 EC. DAPI, 4¶,6-diamidino2-phenylindole.

50 ng/mL of exogenous soluble Netrin-1 increased expression of
h-III tubulin, a common marker for early neuronal differentiation,
in NTERA/2 (f2-fold) and NCCIT (f3.5-fold; Fig. 2A) EC cells.
Thus far, these results show that Netrin-1 can exert comparable
effects in both NTERA/2 and NCCIT EC cells. Further analysis of
Netrin-1–treated NTERA/2 cells shows increased levels of other
markers of early neuronal development, such as Nestin (f2-fold)
and GFAP (f3.5-fold; Fig. 2B). Immunofluorescent staining
confirmed the higher levels of h-III tubulin expressed in Netrin1–treated NTERA/2 EC cells, which seemed to assume a more
neuronal-like morphology with dendritic- or axonal-like cytoplasmic extensions (Fig. 2B). Additional immunofluorescent staining
showed increased expression of the neurotransmitter GABA in
GFAP-positive Netrin-1–treated NTERA/2 EC cells compared with
GFAP-negative untreated control cells (Fig. 2C). We could not
detect mRNA expression of either GATA4 or Brachyury, markers of
endoderm and mesoderm differentiation, respectively, in Netrin-1–
treated or untreated NTERA/2 or NCCIT EC cells (data not shown),
suggesting that Netrin-1 may be more effective in regulating the
expression of markers of neuroectodermal differentiation in
human EC cells.
Netrin-1 activates SHP-2 and increases levels of inactive
c-src in NTERA/2 EC cells. Netrin-1 can bind DCC/Neogenin and
UNC5H family of receptors (14). Western blot analysis showed
expression of Neogenin (Fig. 3A) in NTERA/2 and NCCIT EC cells
but not UNC5HA (data not shown), suggesting that Netrin-1 effects
observed in NTERA/2 or NCCIT EC cells are most likely mediated
via Neogenin. Changes in expression of either Neogenin or UNC5H

www.aacrjournals.org

in Netrin-1–treated and untreated NTERA/2 or NCCIT EC cells
were not detected by Western blot analysis (data not shown).
Previous studies have shown that several responses that are
induced by Netrin-1 can be mediated via recruitment and
activation of intracellular signaling molecules, such as the tyrosine
phosphatase SHP-2 (15). In fact, treatment of NTERA/2 EC cells
with 50 or 100 ng/mL of exogenous soluble Netrin-1 showed
approximately 3- and 2.5-fold increase (P < 0.05), respectively, in
the levels of active P-SHP-2 as determined by Western blot analysis
(Fig. 3B). A similar effect was observed in NCCIT EC cells (data not
shown). Because SHP-2 is known to regulate many intracellular
tyrosine kinases in different cell types (16), we determined whether
this is also true in Netrin-1–treated EC cells. We could not detect
differences in the activation of Akt, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), or
mitogen-activated protein kinase in Netrin-1–treated and untreated NTERA/2 or NCCIT EC cells (data not shown). Members of the
src family of tyrosine kinases are also affected by SHP-2 activity.
Because Fyn and c-src activity have been implicated in Netrin-1
cellular effects (17), it is possible that they might perform a role in
the Netrin-1–induced effects in NTERA/2 and NCCIT EC cells. We
therefore performed Western blot analysis to detect basal levels of
Fyn and c-src in NTERA/2 and NCCIT to determine which of these
tyrosine kinases could be affected by Netrin-1–induced SHP-2
activity. We could not detect activated Fyn in Netrin-1–treated or
untreated NTERA/2 or NCCIT EC cells (data not shown). However,
we did detect an increased ratio between inactive c-src [c-src(Y527)]
to active c-src [c-src(Y416)] in Netrin-1–treated NTERA/2 and
NCCIT EC cells (Fig. 3C and D). The potential molecular interplay

Figure 3. A, Western blot analyses show expression of
the Netrin-1 receptor Neogenin in NTERA/2 and NCCIT EC
cells. B, P-SHP-2 expression is increased in NTERA/2 EC
cells treated with 50 or 100 ng/mL of soluble Netrin-1.
C, Western blot analysis shows reduced expression of
active c-src(Y416) with concomitant increase in the
expression of the inactive c-src(Y527) in Netrin-1–treated
NTERA/2 and NCCIT (inset ) EC cells. D, densitometric
analysis of the results in C shows a significant increase
(*, P < 0.05) in the ratio between the expression of inactive
[P-c-src(Y527)] to active [P-c-src(Y416)] forms of c-src in
NTERA/2 and NCCIT (inset ) EC cells after treatment
with Netrin-1.

between Netrin-1, SHP-2, and c-src was further investigated in
NTERA/2 cells. We found that the Netrin-1–induced effect on c-src
was significantly reduced when NTERA/2 cells were pretreated
with anti-Neogenin blocking antibody (1 Ag/mL) or with the SHP-2
inhibitor (50 Amol/L), alone or in combination (Fig. 3C and D).
Furthermore, when NTERA/2 EC cells were pretreated with the
anti-Neogenin blocking antibody and with the SHP-2 inhibitor,
Netrin-1 could no longer induce the expression of neuroectodermal
markers, such as Nestin (Fig. 4A), or repress the expression of
Nanog, Oct4, and Cripto-1 (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that
exogenous soluble Netrin-1 may affect human EC cells by signaling
via its receptor Neogenin and triggering the activation of SHP-2
resulting in reduced c-src activity.
We show that SHP-2 activation and reduction of active c-src is
associated with reduced levels of Nanog, Oct4, and Cripto-1 and
acquisition of neuroectodermal features in Netrin-1–treated
human EC cells. Previous work has shown that activation of
SHP-2 is associated with differentiation of ES cells (18). Although
other tyrosine kinases, such as Fyn and c-Yes, can play a role
during the maintenance of pluripotency (19), our data suggest

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (5). March 1, 2009

that c-src may be more essential in the Netrin-1–induced effects
observed in the human EC cells used in our study especially
because Fyn, another mediator of Netrin-1 signaling (17), was not
detected in the EC cells, nor was active FAK, a downstream
component of Netrin-1–induced Fyn activity (20). Taken together,
these results show that Netrin-1 can reduce the aggressiveness of
EC cells by influencing signaling pathways known to regulate
pluripotency and affect the expression of stem cell–related
transcription factors and target gene(s). These findings support
the rationale for future investigation of the potential use of
Netrin-1 for treatment of human EC.
