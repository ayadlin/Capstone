BACKGROUND: The objective of the current study was to evaluate the feasibility and toxicity of radiation dose escalation with concurrent chemotherapy using helical tomotherapy (HT) in patients with inoperable, locally advanced,
stage III nonsmall cell lung cancer (LANSCLC) (grading determined according to the American Joint Committee on
Cancer 6th edition grading system). METHODS: This phase 1/2 study was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of radiotherapy in patients with LANSCLC administered concurrently with docetaxel and cisplatin.
Radiotherapy was delivered using HT. A dose per fraction escalation was applied starting at 2 grays (Gy), with an
increase of 6% per dose cohort (DC). The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group acute radiation morbidity score was
used to monitor pulmonary, esophageal, and cardiac toxicity. RESULTS: Dose escalation was performed in 34 patients
over 5 DCs to a dose per fraction of 2.48 Gy. No differences were observed in acute toxicity between the different DCs.
However, a significant increase in late lung toxicity in DC IV, which received a fraction size of 2.36 Gy, necessitated a halt
in further dose escalation with the MTD defined as 2.24 Gy per fraction. The overall incidence of acute grade 3 esophageal and pulmonary toxicity was 24% and 3%, respectively (grading determined according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group-European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer toxicity scoring system). The overall
incidence of late lung toxicity was 21%, but the incidence was an acceptable 13% in DCs I, II, and III. The local response
rate was 61% on computed tomography images. CONCLUSIONS: The use of HT to 67.2 Gy with concurrent cisplatin/
docetaxel was feasible and resulted in acceptable toxicity. A full phase 2 study has been initiated to establish the true

Curative treatment for inoperable, locally advanced, stage III nonsmall cell lung cancer (LANSCLC) remains a challenge. The survival rate at 5 years is dismal, and the low local control rate is a challenge for modern radiotherapy. It has
been demonstrated that improving local control has an impact on survival.1 Many factors have contributed to improving
the local control rate, including an increase in the nominal dose,2 an increase in the biologically equivalent dose (BED),3
the use of technical innovation in radiation delivery,4 and the addition of concurrent chemotherapy.5
In this prospective study, we incorporated several of these approaches. The increased BED was conceived as an
increase in the nominal dose while maintaining a fixed overall treatment time (OTT), a so-called dose-per-fraction escalation.6 Often in dose escalation trials, the OTT is prolonged with increasing dose steps, but it has become evident that

there is an adverse effect on outcome with the prolongation of treatment.7 Finally, because of its known radiosensitizing effect8 and the need for a platinum-containing
doublet as effective systemic treatment, we adopted the
cisplatin/docetaxel combination.9,10
To adequately achieve dose escalation in patients
who, on average, had large, bulky disease, we wanted to
validate and justify the use of a rotational intensitymodulated radiotherapy technique (IMRT), called helical
tomotherapy (HT). Compared with IMRT, the HT
optimization procedure and dose delivery is much more
refined and can lead to dose distributions that are even
more conformal while limiting the dose to the surrounding normal tissues (conformal avoidance).11 The downside of this technique could be the low-dose spread in
healthy lung tissue, a subject that had not yet been examined in a clinical setting at the start of the study.
Because of the increase in BED and the possible influence of low-dose spread, the primary endpoint of the current
study was monitoring of toxicity. Secondary endpoints were
to evaluate efficacy parameters in terms of overall response
rate and survival, to monitor quality of life (QOL), and to
examine changes in tumor volume during therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
Candidates for inclusion in the current study were
patients who had a cytologic or histologic diagnosis of a
stage III, inoperable LANSCLC with a life expectancy of
at least 12 weeks, a Karnofsky performance status (KPS)
80, and a maximum weight loss of 10% within the last
3 months (grading determined according to the American
Joint Committee on Cancer 6th edition grading system).
Initial workup consisted of bronchoscopy, pulmonary
function tests (PFTs), computed tomography (CT) of the
thorax, positron emission tomography (PET) using the
radio-labeled glucose analogue F18-fluorodeoxyglucose
(FDG-PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the
brain, and additional imaging studies as indicated.
Patients were eligible to enter the study when they were
deemed fit for a combined-modality approach after multidisciplinary review. Patients had to sign an informed consent before entering the study protocol. The treatment
protocol was reviewed and approved by the competent
authorities and the institutional ethics committee and was
registered (National Clinical Trial no. NCT00379717
and European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trial no. EUDRACT2006-003708-21).

Treatment Protocol
This study was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of radiotherapy in a concurrent setting
with fixed-dose chemotherapy plus docetaxel and cisplatin
at a dose of 20 mg/m2 each administered weekly and starting on Day 1 of radiotherapy for 6 cycles. Radiotherapy
was delivered in 30 daily fractions. The OTT was set
between 40 days and 44 days. This upfront chemoradiation was followed by 2 cycles of consolidation chemotherapy with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and cisplatin at 75 mg/m2
administered up to 4 weeks after the completion of radiation with a 3-week interval.
The radiotherapy fraction size was escalated when
the cumulative acute grade 3 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)
incidence was <50% for at least 3 patients who had a
minimum follow-up of 3 months after the start of radiotherapy. To allow for a full 3-month assessment of at least
3 patients per cohort, inclusion in that same dose-escalation cohort was continued as long as required with a minimum of 5 patients. Grade 5 toxicity would result in an
immediate halt of the study and acceptance of the previous cohort’s dose as the MTD.
Dose specifications are summarized in Table 1. A
protocol amendment was issued in February 2008 that
omitted the consolidation chemotherapy after an interim
toxicity analysis and based on literature data indicating
that there was no benefit from consolidation
chemotherapy.12

Radiotherapy Technique
Patients were referred for a planning CT and FDG-PET
in the treatment position on a dedicated PET-CT scanner
(GeminiTF64; Philips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands). Delineation was performed of the macroscopic
(gross) tumor volume (GTV); the clinical target volume
and planning target volume (CTV/PTV) for involved
lymph nodes and the primary tumor separately; and the
lungs, esophagus, spinal cord, thyroid gland, kidneys,
heart, liver, and stomach. The CTV for the lymph nodes
consisted of the entire FDG-PET-involved lymph node
region13,14 with an isotropic 3-mm expansion for the
PTV. The primary CTV was a 5-mm margin around the
GTV in the lungs or airway without bone, vessel, or other
mediastinal organs unless there was proven invasion by
the tumor. The PTV for the primary tumor was the isotropic expansion of 5 mm or 8 mm around the CTV in
case of upper/middle or lower lobe locations, respectively.
Protocol dose constraints are listed in Table 1.

Treatment delivery was performed on the TomoTherapy HiArt II system (TomoTherapy Inc., Madison,
Wis), which is a linear accelerator that combines 6-megavolt (MV) IMRT with megavoltage CT imaging
(MVCT) before treatment.15,16 The gantry rotates continuously while the patient is translated through the bore,
resulting in a helical treatment. Instead of choosing a
fixed-beam setup, tomotherapy patients are treated with
51 equispaced beam directions per gantry rotation, which
allows a much greater degree of freedom in the modulation because of the significant increase in the number of
beamlets.17,18
The tumor region was scanned on a daily basis, and
positioning was done using the integrated registration
with the planning CT.19-21 Although a difference in resolution exists between kilovolt and MVCT images, the
quality of MV imaging is sufficient for patient positioning.22 Positioning was done both on bony and soft tissue
anatomy and incorporated respiratory motion, because
the MVCT procedure can be considered a ‘‘slow’’ CT.
Daily MVCT allows the clinician to take into account any
changes in internal anatomy that affect positioning based
on tumor response during treatment.
Toxicity Monitoring
Acute DLTs were defined as esophageal, pulmonary and,
cardiac toxicities and were scored according to a modified
Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)-European

Cancer

January 1, 2010

Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
(EORTC) acute toxicity scoring table. All other toxicities
were graded according to version 3.0 of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse
Events. Toxicity was monitored at least once weekly by
the treating medical and radiation oncologist in patients
who received ambulatory treatment and daily when
patients were hospitalized because of excessive toxicity.
During follow-up, patients were seen every 3 months during the first 2 years and every 4 months to 6 months thereafter. For late toxicity, the RTOG late morbidity scoring
for esophagus, heart, and lungs was used together with the
Subjective, Objective, Management, and Analytic/Late
Effects in Normal Tissues (SOMA-LENT) scoring system
for the lungs and esophagus.23 PFTs were repeated at every visit. The impact of the treatment schedule on QOL
was assessed, using standardized questionnaires (the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lung and the
EORTC QLQ C30) at the beginning and at the end of
treatment.
Response Assessment
Tumor size and metabolism were assessed before treatment and 3 months after the start of chemoradiation (and
at least 2 weeks after the last consolidation chemotherapy)
using PET-CT. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors were used to evaluate treatment response based
on CT studies. For FDG-PET, the standardized uptake

243

Original Article

value (SUV) (SUV ¼ [decay-corrected activity per mL tissue]/[injected activity]*[body mass]) was calculated. The
SUV was acquired by manually positioning a 3-dimensional, ellipsoidal region of interest that covered the target.
To minimize partial volume effect, the pixel with the maximum SUV value (SUVmax) within the volume of interest
was identified. SUV values were normalized further to the
circulating serum glucose level (SUVmax.glu ¼ SUVmax 
serum glucose [mg percentage]/100). In addition, a metabolic volume was calculated by adding all pixels with an
SUV 2.5 within the region of interest. Patients were
considered complete metabolic responders when the metabolic volume became zero.24 In further follow-up, a
scheduled CT scan of the thorax was obtained at least
every 3 months, and an FDG-PET study was obtained
yearly.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses of variance and Student t tests were performed
using Statview software (version 5.0.1; SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC). P values were considered significant at <.05,
in which case, the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) also
was calculated. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used for actuarial analysis with CIs using the ‘‘Greenwood method,’’
and overall survival was calculated from initial diagnosis.
Simple regression analysis was used to identify the correlation between dose-volumetric characteristics and the
degree of late lung DLT.

RESULTS
Treatment Feasibility
Between October 2006 and August 2008, 34 patients
were included in the current study. Their baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 2. All patients received
the prescribed radiotherapy dose with a mean treatment
time of 42 days; the only exception was 1 patient who
died because of early progressive disease. The dose intensity of concurrent cisplatin and docetaxel was 94% for
each. Dose reductions and/or the omission of concurrent
chemotherapy were mainly because of esophageal toxicity
(n ¼ 4) or hematologic toxicity (n ¼ 3). In the consolidation phase (n ¼ 23), dose intensity in Dose Cohort (DC)
I was 94% but dropped to 64% in DC II and to 59% in
DC III. Consolidation chemotherapy could not be
administered to 6 patients (2 patients died, and 4 patients
had progressive disease) and was given only for 1 cycle in
2 patients because of recall esophageal toxicity. In 15
patients who received 2 cycles of consolidation chemotherapy, the dose intensity was 98% with minor reduc-

of concurrent chemoradiation, we observed an average
weight loss of 4.1% (range, from 17% to þ6%) and a
drop in the median KPS from 100 to 80, whereas 24% of
patients experienced a drop in KPS 30.
Late Toxicity
The incidence of late esophageal and pulmonary toxicity
is summarized in Table 4. One patient developed esophageal stenosis, which necessitated a stent. Other episodes of
late gastrointestinal toxicity consisted mainly of persistent
weight loss, which occurred in 80% of episodes with a
simultaneous diagnosis of progressive disease and subsequent second-line therapy. Cumulative late lung toxicity
grade 3 was 21% and 29% according to the RTOG and
SOMA-LENT scores, respectively. Grade 3 SOMALENT lung toxicity was scored as such because of dyspnea (4 patients), cough (1 patient), radiologic changes
(6 patients), and decreased lung function (3 patients).

Original Article

These subjective and objective symptoms resulted in the
management of grade 3 cough, dyspnea, and chest pain
in 4 patients, 6 patients, and 1 patient, respectively.
The mean changes in PFTs were þ1% (standard
deviation [SD], 22%) and 14% (SD, 23%) for 1-second
forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and carbon monoxide
diffusion capacity (DLCO), respectively. In 41% of
patients, a grade 2 decline in PFT was registered during
follow-up. The incidence of grade 3 RTOG late lung
toxicity in DCs I, II, and III was 14% (95% CI, 0%-28%)
versus 44% (95% CI, 7%-82%) in DC IV (P ¼ .06).
Two patients in DC IV died of radiopneumonitis at 4
months and 5 months after the start of radiotherapy,
respectively; in those patients, the relative lung volumes
(V) that received 20 grays (Gy) (V20) were 24% and 23%,
and the a normalized mean lung dose (nMLD) was 13.6
Gy and 8.3 Gy, respectively. The low-dose distribution
(<20 Gy) for these 2 patients is illustrated in Figure 1

compared with the entire study population. No medication that had a known possible interaction with radiation
was identified. The respective PFTs for both patients
before treatment were 88% and 87% for FEV1 and 77%
and 84% for DLCO.
The first patient died before PFTs were repeated,
and the other patient had decreases of 18% and 46% in
FEV1 and DLCO, respectively. Figure 2 illustrates the
dose distribution of the latter patient with the PET-CT at
the time of active radiopneumonitis.
Response Evaluation
With a median follow-up at the time of analysis of 17
month in 17 surviving patients, we calculated a median
survival of 17.9 months (95% CI, 12 months to not
reached). Actuarial survival is illustrated in Figure 3.
Response evaluation is summarized in Table 5. One
patient died before any re-evaluation could be performed,
and 2 additional patients died without control PET-CT
images but with evidence of brain metastases on MRIs.
Therefore, overall and local treatment responses were
assessed in 33 patients and 31 patients, respectively. All
patients who had progressive disease at 3 months failed in
the brain (3 patients) or bone (3 patients).

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, the current study is the first report on
the use of HT and concurrent chemotherapy for
LANSCLC. The treatment approach was feasible and had
an acceptable dose intensity of radiation and chemotherapy in the concurrent phase. Radiotherapy could be given
within the restricted delivery time in all patients. All radiation plans met the given dose constraints while maintaining sufficient PTV coverage even in this unbalanced
patient population, in which the majority had stage IIIB
disease. This suggested the usefulness of HT as a widely

applicable technique for dose delivery in LANSCLC, even
when doses were extended above the benchmark of 60
Gy.1 In previous hypofractionated dose-escalation trials,
escalation was performed using 3-dimensional conformal
radiotherapy (CRT).25-27 The use of CRT can be insufficient for large and/or centrally located lesions or for
patients who have widespread lymph node involvement
and can lead to increased toxicity rates and the inability to
reach an appropriate dose.28-30 Liu et al demonstrated
that IMRT could reduce the irradiated volumes of normal
lung tissue and other critical structures significantly while
maintaining an adequate dose to the target volume.31
When the complexity of target volumes increases, the difference between CRT and IMRT becomes even more significant in favor of IMRT. Therefore, the current results
are in line with previous retrospective reports on staticbeam IMRT in chemoradiation and dose-escalated conformal chemoradiation.32,33 Compared with static
IMRT, plan optimization possibilities with HT are more
flexible and slightly better because of its rotational nature,
resulting in the kind of dose delivery illustrated in Figure

50 Gy while expelling the 20-Gy isodose from the contralateral lung and maintaining the adequate coverage (>95%

not comparative, so we cannot exclude the possibility that

other IMRT techniques may achieve comparable results as
long as the same dose constraints can be met.
An issue in the delivery of consolidation chemotherapy was encountered. Although part of it was because of
progressive disease, omissions, reductions, and postponements of consolidation chemotherapy reduced overall
dose intensity and prolonged OTT. An intercurrent publication indicated no survival benefit but increased toxicity for consolidation chemotherapy.12 In light of this
finding, a protocol amendment was issued during the conduct of this study to allow further dose escalation without
consolidation chemotherapy.
In their most recent meta-analysis, in which concurrent and sequential chemotherapy were compared,
Auperin et al emphasized the 5.7-fold increase in the incidence of esophagitis to 18%34 also reported in published,
individual phase 3 studies with statistically significant
increases in the rate of grade 3 esophagitis from 4% to
18%35 and from 3% to 32%.36 We concluded that the
acute toxicity rate in the current dose-escalation trial of
24% and 3% for esophagus and lung, respectively was
within the expected range and, thus, was acceptable.
Encouraging for the use of HT was the observation of a

247

remarkable reduction in grade 3 esophagitis for the
higher DCs, although no anatomic difference with respect
to proximity between the esophagus and the PTV could
be observed. We assumed that, because of the higher
nominal dose in these higher DCs, the inverse planning
system avoided the region of overlap between the esophagus and the PTV. Whether this reduced circumferential
irradiation resulted in the lower toxicity rate is being
investigated in a phase 2 study that incorporates more
stringent dose constraints regarding the esophagus.
The study was halted in September 2008 because of
2 toxic deaths that were caused by late lung toxicity. In
both patients, the pathology reports confirmed massive
radiation-induced inflammation and fibrosis. The overall
RTOG grade 3 late lung toxicity rate was 21%. This cumulative incidence of severe late lung toxicity seemed
higher than the 9% to 15.6% that was reported in 3 other
radiation dose-escalation trials. Only 1 patient with grade
5 toxicity was reported in those 3 studies combined.26,27,37 However, those trials reported on patients
with stage I, II, and III NSCLC; only 16% received induction chemotherapy, and no concurrent chemotherapy was
allowed. However, the reported RTOG grade 3 late
lung toxicity rate of 14% in DCs I, II, and III appeared to
be acceptable.
An analysis of known dose-volume and dose-distribution parameters (V20 and nMLD), as identified in these
dose-escalation studies and in other reports on the prediction of late lung toxicity, did not reveal why these 2
patients developed lethal radiopneumonitis.38,39 At the
start of this study, the nMLD still was considered valid as
a planning constraint because it was proposed and used in
a synchronous dose-escalation study using HT in patients
who had inoperable stage I, II, and III NSCLC.6,40 There
may be a concern that the late lung toxicity in the current
study was caused by an increase in the lung volume that
received low-dose irradiation (dose littering), which is
more common in complex irradiation techniques, such as
HT.41 However the low-dose region in the 2 patients who
had grade 5 toxicity could not be singled out compared
with all other study patients (Fig. 1). The relative lung
volumes that received 5 Gy and 10 Gy (V5/V10) in the
current series (Table 6) were comparable to the values
reported in a clinical study using static-beam IMRT.32
Preliminary correlation analyses of dose volumetric parameters and the occurrence of overall and RTOG grade
3 late lung toxicity were performed. Even in this small
series, those analyses revealed the larger impact of high-

dose regions and primarily the tumor volume compared
with low-dose spread (Table 6). Although further analysis
in a larger population certainly is warranted, our results
corroborate those of Willner et al, who reported that the
reduction in the high-dose region was more important
than the often counterbalanced increase in the low-dose
region.42 Gopal et al demonstrated that local functional
loss was nonexistent in lung subvolumes that received
<10 Gy.43 Compared with dose-escalated concurrent
chemoradiation, the overall RTOG grade 3 late lung
toxicity was equal to the 25% reported using CRT.44 The
reported 14% in DCs I, II, and III was in line with a retrospective analysis of IMRT for concurrent chemoradiation
that even demonstrated an advantage over CRT.32 Therefore, we decided that the MTD should be set at 2.24 Gy
per fraction.
Although it was not a primary endpoint in the current study, response analysis revealed a complete metabolic response in 55% of patients. This appeared to be
encouraging enough to continue the amended study as a
full phase 2 study using a Bryant and Day design.45 Unacceptable cumulative esophageal and pulmonary  grade 3
toxicity (T) was set at 30%, and an unacceptable local
metabolic response rate (R) was set at 50% (the probability for accepting poor response [
aR] or rejecting good
response [b] was set at 15%; the probability of acceptance
of a toxic treatment [
aT] was kept at 5%).
In this phase 1/2 study, we assessed the possibility of
radiation dose escalation with HT and concurrent cisplatin/docetaxel. The MTD for concurrent chemoradiation
was set at 67.2 Gy in 30 fractions. This treatment schedule

is feasible and has acceptable toxicity with a promising
response rate. To confirm the treatment efficacy and toxicity at the MTD, this schedule currently us being investigated in a phase 2 study.
