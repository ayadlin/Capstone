ABSTRACT
Glutaminase, which converts glutamine to glutamate, is involved in Warburg
effect in cancer cells. Two human glutaminase genes have been identified, GLS
(GLS1) and GLS2. Two alternative transcripts arise from each glutaminase gene:
first, the kidney isoform (KGA) and glutaminase C (GAC) for GLS; and, second, the
liver isoform (LGA) and glutaminase B (GAB) for GLS2. While GLS1 is considered as
a cancer therapeutic target, the potential role of GLS2 in cancer remains unclear.
Here, we discovered a series of alkyl benzoquinones that preferentially inhibit
glutaminase B isoform (GAB, GLS2) rather than the kidney isoform of glutaminase
(KGA, GLS1). We identified amino acid residues in an allosteric binding pocket
responsible for the selectivity. Treatment with the alkyl benzoquinones decreased
intracellular glutaminase activity and glutamate levels. GLS2 inhibition by either alkyl
benzoquinones or GLS2 siRNA reduced carcinoma cell proliferation and anchorageindependent colony formation, and induced autophagy via AMPK mediated mTORC1
inhibition. Our findings demonstrate amino acid sequences for selective inhibition of
glutaminase isozymes and validate GLS2 as a potential anti-cancer target.

INTRODUCTION

enters the TCA cycle where it is involved in the production
of ATP, nucleotides, certain amino acids, lipids, and
glutathione in mitochondria [1]. Recently, glutaminase
has emerged as a drug target for the development of
glutaminase inhibitors for the treatment of cancerous
disease [2]. However, only a few series of glutaminase
inhibitors for GLS1 have been identified, and only partial
in vivo anti-cancer efficacy has been demonstrated [3-6].
There are two human glutaminase genes, GLS
(GLS1) and GLS2, located in chromosomes 2 and 12
respectively. Two alternative transcripts arise from
each glutaminase gene: the kidney isoform (KGA) and

Cancer cells tend to exhibit the Warburg effect, in
which cellular metabolisms proceed via: 1) an altered
glucose metabolism characterized by a high rate of
glycolysis followed by lactic acid fermentation; and 2)
up-regulated glutaminolysis by increasing glutaminase
activity. Glutamine is essential for cancer cell proliferation,
especially in the context of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
anaplerosis. Glutaminase plays an essential role converting
glutamine to glutamate, which is converted by glutamate
dehydrogenase into α-ketoglutarate. This α-ketoglutarate

glutaminase C (GAC) for GLS1; and the liver isoform
(LGA) and glutaminase B (GAB) for GLS2 [7].
The dimer-to-tetramer transition is essential for
the enzymatic activation of glutaminase, which is active
as a tetramer. Phosphate enhances this activation by
facilitating the dimer-to-tetramer transition and substrate
entry to the binding pocket by competing with the product
glutamate [3, 8]. Each glutaminase isoform has distinct
kinetic and molecular characteristics, and the activity of
each is also modulated by a variety of compounds, such as
glutamate, citrate, calcium, certain long chain fatty acids,
fatty acyl-CoA derivatives, TCA cycle intermediates, and
protons [9], all of which are present under physiological
conditions. Therefore, the kinetic and allosteric properties
of the enzyme and the physiological environment are
essential for regulating the enzyme activity in situ. Also,
the differentiated amino acid residues or domains of the
glutaminase isozymes provide potential binding pockets
for selective allosteric modulators. For example, BPTES
(bis-2-(5-phenylacetimido-1,2,4-thiadiazol-2-yl) ethyl
sulfide), a GLS1 selective inhibitor, binds GAC through
a differentiated gating loop close to the glutamine
substrate binding site and locks the GAC tetramer into a
nonproductive conformation [3].
In contrast to the disease indications of the KGA and
GAC (GLS1) inhibitors described for anti-cancer [5, 6,
10], the biological role of GLS2 is still under exploration.
GLS2 was found to regulate energy metabolism and
antioxidant function as a tumor suppressor gene [1113]when ectopically overexpressed [11]; enrichment
with LGA inhibits glioma cell growth and facilitates
chemotherapeutic intervention [14]. However, knockdown of GLS2 expression sensitizes cervical cancer to
ionizing radiation and thus reduces tumor size through
decreasing cellular glutathione and NADH [15].
Therefore, more work is needed to clarify and demonstrate
the role of GLS2 in cancer cell growth.
Glutaminase inhibition blocks the conversion of
glutamine to glutamate and thus disables the conversion
of glutamate into α-ketoglutarate by glutamate
dehydrogenase, which normally enters the TCA cycle to
provide energy and bio-precursors for cancer cell growth.
Autophagy is a catabolic process generally activated
by such conditions of nutrient deprivation, and results
in the autophagosomic-lysosomal degradation of bulk
cytoplasmic contents. Autophagy is initiated and promoted
by AMPK_ULK1 axis but inhibited by mTORC1 [16].
AMPK senses energy changes in cells and is activated
when nutrients are depleted [17]. Rapamycin inhibits the
Warburg effect [18, 19] and glutaminolysis feeds mTORC1
[20] so that a complex feedback exists between mTOR
and glutaminase and Warburg effect. mTORC1 is also a
critical regulator of autophagy induction and activation of
mTORC1 suppresses autophagy. AMPK interacts with,
phosphorylates, and activates ULK1 protein kinase, a
key initiator of the autophagic process. Residue Ser317
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of ULK1 is the main phosphorylation site for activation
by AMPK [16]. In mammals, AMPK regulates autophagy,
also involving inactivation of the mTORC1 pathway
upon nutrient deficiency through two distinct pathways:
phosphorylation for activation of Tuberin exchange factor
or Raptor [21]. Conversely, mTOR phosphorylates ULK1
at Ser757 and disrupts the interaction between ULK1 and
AMPK to inhibit autophagy [16]. In addition, the Beclin1
network also can induce and regulate autophagy via the
formation of Beclin1-Vps34-Vps15 core complexes, and
phagophore nucleation. The interaction of BCL2 with
Beclin1 reduces autophagy. Phosphorylation of BCL2
by c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) liberates Beclin1,
allowing it to enter the nucleation process for autophagy
[22]. Phosphorylation of Beclin1 by ULK1 at Ser15 (Ser14
in mice) is also required for full autophagic induction in
mammals [23].
Natural products are a major source of inspiration
in drug discovery [24, 25], and constitute a good resource
for those seeking novel glutaminase inhibitors. While
GLS1 is emerging as a therapeutic target for anticancer
drugs [5, 6, 10], the biological role of GLS2 is still under
exploration. Herein, we disclose a series of natural alkyl
benzoquinones with a glutaminase inhibitory effect.
Through homologous modeling and mutagenesis, the
alkyl benzoquinone binding site was simulated and
demonstrated to be an allosteric pocket. From the
allosteric pocket, two divergently differentiated residues
were found to account for the selective inhibition for GAB
(an isoform of GLS2) over KGA (an isoform of GLS1).
Furthermore, inhibition of glutaminase activity by the
active alkyl benzoquinone AV-1 in carcinoma cells led
to autophagy via AMPK-mediated ULK1 activation and
mTORC1 inhibition, ultimately leading to inhibition of
cancer cell growth.

RESULTS
Purification of the recombinant human KGA
and GAB for screening glutaminase inhibitors
and analysis of structure-activity relations and
inhibition modes
A collection of ~200 natural products isolated from
a variety of indigenous Taiwanese plants were submitted
for screening against KGA. Human recombinant KGA
and GAB (Figure 1A) from E. coli were cloned, expressed
and purified. Characterization of its enzymatic properties
showed that the recombinant GAB but not KGA responded
to its substrate glutamine in allosteric and positive
cooperative manners (Figure 1B and 1C), as previously
reported for these enzymes purified from human biopsies
[26]. We first screened the compound collection described
above for inhibitory activity against the recombinant

KGA, and then determined the IC50 values against KGA
and GAB for the potent compounds (Table 1, Figure 1D).
Among the active hit compounds, a series of alkyl
benzoquinones from Ardisia. virens (Table 1, AV series)
were found to exhibit inhibition of human KGA and GAB
(Table 1 & Figure 1D). The keto (hydroxyl) groups at
positions 1 and 4 on the benzoquinone core and the acetate
group at position 2’ were all found to be essential for
potency for either KGA or GAB inhibition, by comparing
the most potent compounds AV-1, AV-2, and AV-8 (KGA,
IC50 values 2.1±0.1 µM; 3.9±0.4 µM; 2.9±0.1 µM; GAB,
IC50 values 0.28±0.02 µM; 0.29±0.05µM; 0.26±0.05 µM
respectively) to the other AV compounds (KGA, IC50
values > 40 µM; GAB, IC50 values > 4.7 µM) (Table 1).
As the AV compounds were also found to be
selective for GAB over KGA, the inhibition mode of AV-1
(the most active) was investigated. AV-1 inhibited both
KGA and GAB in a mixed non-competitive inhibition;
when AV-1 concentration was increased from 0 to 30 µM,
the Km values increased by 2.9- and 1.6-fold and the Vmax
values decreased to 61% and 54% for KGA and GAB
respectively (Figure 1 B & 1C). AV-1 exhibited Ki values
of 1.20±0.06 µM for KGA and 0.14±0.01 µM for GAB,
as calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation; the AV-1
exerted a positive cooperative manner with the substrate
glutamine in inhibiting GAB with a Hill coefficient of
~1.3-1.4 and an independent manner in inhibiting KGA
with a Hill coefficient of ~1.0-1.2 (Figure 1B & 1C). In
conclusion, the mechanisms by which AV-1 inhibits GAB
and KGA are different.

Mutagenesis studies to validate the interactions for
selectivity were next carried out. When the residues Q452
and K453 in GAB were mutated into His or Asp to give the
mutants Q452H, K453D or Q452H/K453D, the inhibitory
effect significantly decreased: IC50 values of 0.28 ± 0.02
µM (wild type), 1.33 ± 0.32 µM (Q452H), 4.17 ± 0.11
µM (K453D), and 5.51 ± 0.28 µM (Q452H/K453D) were
measured. These results demonstrate that the effects of
the two GAB point mutations in decreasing AV-1 potency
were additive. On the contrary, when the corresponding
residues H519 and D520 in KGA were mutated into Gln
or Lys to give the mutants H519Q, D520K or H519Q/
D520K, the inhibitory effect increased: IC50 values of 2.1
± 0.1 µM (wild type), 1.67 ± 0.12µM (H519Q), 0.29 ±
0.03 µM (D520K), and 0.23 ± 0.03 µM (H519Q/D520K)
were measured. These results demonstrate that the effects
of the two KGA point mutations reversely increased AV-1
potency.
Moreover, AV-1 comparably inhibited the wild type
and the two KGA mutants corresponding to those of GAC
(F318Y/F322S; Y394L) (Figure 2D) while these two
KGA mutant enzymes were resistant to BPTES inhibition
due to loss of key interactions demonstrated from cocrystallization data previously reported (Figure 2D) [3].
Therefore, we conclude that the interactions between
AV-1 and GAB residues Q452 and K453 determine the
selectivity for GAB over KGA.

GLS2 inhibition via AV-1 compound or RNA
silencing exhibits anti-cancer cell proliferation
and anti- anchorage-independent colony
formation

Homologous modeling, docking studies, and
binding site analysis

GAB and KGA protein expression levels were
found to be higher in human hepatoma HepG2 and lung
carcinoma A549 cells than those in fibroblast cell lines
Detroit 551 and WI-38, whilst GAC expression levels
were not significantly changed (Figure 3A). LGA protein
expression was low in each cell line but expressed
slightly more in HepG2. KGA exhibited two major forms
of protein, one of which was multi-phosphorylated as
demonstrated by an addition of phosphatase experiment
that affected the phosphorylation of KGA and changed
the electrophoretic mobility of KGA protein in SDS gel
(Figure 3A & Figure S1). The capacity of these compounds
to inhibit growth of the cell lines A549, HepG2, MCF7
(human breast carcinoma), NCI-H460 (human lung
carcinoma), and SF268 (human glioblastoma) (Figure 3B,
Table S1, and previously described [27, 28]) were found
to be consistent with their glutaminase inhibition (Table
1). Moreover, AV-1 inhibited colony formation of HepG2
cells, as did GLS1 inhibitor BPTES, a reference control
(Figure 3C, left panel). After further knocking down
GLS2 protein expression using a silencing RNA approach
(see Materials and Methods), the A549 and HepG2 cell

Based on the structure-activity relationships and
inhibition modes analyzed above, we sought to determine
the possible location of the AV-1-binding site on GAB
[3]. Homologous modeling for GAB was conducted using
the human GLS1 crystal structure 3UO9 and AutoDock
Vina (http://vina.scripps.edu/). AutoDock Vina was further
used to carry out a docking study for compound AV-1
over the entire surface of the homologous modeled GAB
dimer or monoer. The simulated pocket for AV-1 binding
from docking showed major hydrogen bond and van der
Waals interactions between AV-1 with the GAB residues
H408, Q452, K453, S456, H461 and H472 (Figure 2A).
The binding pocket is located at the C-terminal end of the
GAB monomer, close to the dimer interaction interface.
However, no inter-monomeric interactions were found
for AV-1 and therefore it is assumed that one AV-1 binds
to one GAB monomer as shown in Figure 2B. Further
sequence comparison of KGA and GAB at the AV-1
binding region indicate that the GAB residues Q452
and K453 were differentiated from those corresponding
residues of KGA H519 and D520 (Figure 2C).

AV-1 compound treatment results in mTORC1
inhibition through activated AMPK and inhibited
P13K/Akt

growth were decreased by ~45-81% (Figure 3D) and
colony formation inhibited accordingly (Figure 3C, right
panel). AV-1 treatment significantly decreased intracellular
glutaminase activity and product glutamate levels (Figure
3E & 3F). Therefore, the alkyl benzoquinones inhibited
carcinoma cell growth by inhibiting cellular glutaminase
activity.

To investigate how mTORC1 activity is regulated
by AV-1, phosphorylation of the mTORC1 components
mTOR, Raptor, and Tuberin were separately examined
(Fig. 5A). Firstly, phosphorylation at Ser2448 and autophosphorylation at Ser2481 of mTOR for activation
via PI3K/AKT [32, 33] started to level off around 12 h,
and then gradually increased until phosphorylation was
complete at 72 h in AV-1 treated HepG2 cells. On the
contrary, gradually decreasing levels of phosphorylation
for these two sites occurred in the DMSO vehicle

AV-1 compound induces autophagy and activates
AMPK
Anti-cancer agents usually induce diversified forms
of cell death including apoptosis and autophagy [29].
To examine whether AV-1 inhibited cell growth leads to
cell death, the cell death-related apoptosis and autophagy
pathways were examined in AV-1 treated HepG2 cells.
Autophagic activity was monitored by tracking the
conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II. A reliable marker of
autophagosome LC3 is a mammalian homolog of yeast
Atg8 [30]. It was found that LC3-II production was
induced after the treatment of HepG2 cells with AV-1 for
24-72 h (Figure 4A), but the apoptosis marker-cleaved
caspase 3 [31] was not detected (Figure 4A). Because
glutaminase inhibition in cancer cells decreases cellular
energy production and results in nutrient depletion [5]
(Figures 3 B-F); and because autophagy is generally
activated by conditions of nutrient deprivation [16], we
concluded that induction of autophagy by AV-1 treatment
was responsible for cell death (Figures 3B-E and 4A).
Autophagy is initiated and promoted by activation of
AMPK_ULK1 axis signaling, but inhibited by mTORC1
[16]. Therefore, we examined the effects of AV-1 treatment
on these signaling pathways in HepG2 carcinoma cells.
Our investigation of the autophagy-related AMPK
signaling pathway regulated by AV-1 showed: i) AMPK
was phosphorylated for activation 0.5-3 h after AV-1
treatment (Fig 4B); ii) the moderate phosphorylation of
ULK1 at Ser317 by AMPK [16] occurred at 3-12 h while
the phosphorylation of ULK1 at Ser757 by mTOR [16]
was significantly decreased up to 72 h after AV-1 treatment
(Fig 4C); iii) The protein and phosphorylation (at Ser15)
levels of autophagic Beclin1 were not significantly
affected and the level of phosphorylated BCL2 decreased
up to 72 h after AV-1 treatment (Figure 4C). These
results indicate that the AMPK and ULK1 were activated

treatment.
Secondly, another nutrient sensing residue, Thr2446
of mTOR, which undergoes phosphorylation by AMPK
to give inactivated mTOR under conditions of nutrient
deprivation [34], underwent significant phosphorylation
in the first 24 h, only to become dephosphorylated around
48-72 h in HepG2 cells treated with AV-1. On the contrary,
HepG2 cells treated with DMSO vehicle did not show
phosphorylation at Thr2446 of mTOR in the first 12 h,
but a gradual increase in phosphorylation occurred from
24 h up to 72 h (Figure 5A). These results suggest that
mTOR activity was inhibited for the first 12 h after AV-1
treatment, after which it became activated again.
Thirdly, residue Thr1462 of Tuberin (an AKT
phosphorylation site to activate mTORC1) [35] was
phosphorylated all over the 72 h-time course and even
getting highly phosphorylated at 48-72 h period in
the HepG2 cells treated with DMSO. However, AV-1
treatment disabled Tuberin phosphorylation at Thr1462
over the same time period (Figure 5A). These results
suggested that AV-1 treatment likely inhibited PI3K/AKT
activity and the resultant Tuberin (dephosphorylated at
Thr1462) did contribute to inhibition of the mTORC1
activity.

Fourthly, a dramatic increase in phosphorylation of
Raptor at Ser792 (a site for AMPK direct phosphorylation)
for mTORC1 inactivation upon AV-1 treatment was
observed compared to DMSO vehicle controls (Figure 5A
upper panel).
Fifthly, mTORC1 inhibition was further manifested
by the elimination of phosphorylation of p70S6K and
4E-BP, further downstream targets of mTORC1 by AV-1
treatment (Figure 5A lower panel).
Lastly, compound C (an AMPK inhibitor) attenuated
the AV-1 induced phosphorylation of Raptor at Ser792 and
Tuberin at Ser1387 (Figure 5B). In response to nutrient
deprivation, Ser1387 of Tuberin gets phosphorylated by
AMPK which also leads to mTORC1 inactivation [36].
On the contrary, compound C reversed the decreased
phosphorylation of ULK1 Ser757 (Figure 5B and Figure
S2).
Thus, we conclude that AV-1 inhibited intracellular
glutaminase activity and resulted in decreased glutamate
level in HepG2 cells, leading to autophagy by AMPK
activation. AV-1 treatment activated AMPK which
moderately phosphorylated ULK1 at Ser317 for autophagy
initiation, and strongly phosphorylated Raptor at Ser792
and Tuberin at Ser1387 for mTORC1 inactivation for

binding sites and site-directed mutagenesis performed
to validate the important interacting residues. For
example, two key residues Arg 539 and Phe 532 were
mutated to construct R539L and F532L GAC mutants;
dibenzophenanthridine-968 was found to be a greatly
inferior inhibitor of GAC mutants than wild type. In
order to understand more about the binding site of
AV compounds, homologous modeling, docking and
mutagenesis studies were used to propose an AV-1
binding site in GAB, and the roles of interacted residues
in AV-1 selectivity for GAB over KGA. The analysis of
structure-activity relationships reveals the importance of
the two keto or hydroxyl group at positions 1 and 4 at
the benzoquinone core and an acetate group at position 2’
for AV-1 potency in inhibiting KGA and GAB. Docking
studies found these side groups of AV-1 to interact with
conserved residues Ser456 and Lys472 at GAB through
hydrogen bonds (Figure 2A). In addition, replacement of
the GAB residues Q452 and K453 with the corresponding
KGA residues His519 and Asp520 affected glutaminase
selectivity of AV-1 for GAB (GLS2) over KGA (GLS1)
(Figure 2A & 2D), presumably because these residues
interact with AV-1 through van der Waal forces. We
constructed two KGA mutants corresponding to those of
GAC (F318Y/F322S; Y394L) and tested their activities.
As expected, BPTES was not a potent inhibitor of these
two KGA mutants, whilst AV-1 inhibited both wild type
KGA and the mutants to a similar degree (Figure 2D). This
divergent differentiation of the isoforms of GAB and KGA
presents the possible selective allosteric binding sites for
GLS1 over GLS2 or GLS2 over GLS1. Moreover, these
results clearly demonstrate that the proximal binding
site of AV-1 was different from those of BPTES and
dibenzophenanthridine-968.
The amino acid sequences of the glutaminase
isoforms are highly homologous (81% identity) within
their catalytic core regions (Figure S3, [37-39]). The rest
of heterogeneous regions present potential differentiated
allosteric pockets subjected to various modulations in
enzymatic activity as evidence by inhibitors BPTES,
dibenzophenanthridine-968, and AV-1. The accessibility
of these allosteric pockets to small physiological
molecules would allow for physiological modulations in
the enzymatic activity. Thus, the possibility of identifying
more allosteric pockets for modulating glutaminase
isozymes merits further investigation.

DISCUSSION
Herein, we report that natural product alkyl
benzoquinones are novel inhibitors of the emerging cancer
drug target glutaminase, a discovery made by screening
a small collection of natural products. The chemical
structures of the AV and AK compounds include a fatty
acid moiety, reflecting the fact that fatty acids and fatty
acyl-coenzyme A derivatives can modulate glutaminase
activity [9]. Thus, the possibility arises that potent
endogenous modulators may exist and play significant
roles in regulating glutaminase activity under various
physiological conditions.
GLS2 expression was reported to be significantly
increased in 186 human colon carcinoma samples. GLS2
depletion in HT1299 lung cancer cells by siRNA increased
the apoptosis cell population and, in combination with
the inducers of ROS-dependent apoptosis doxorubicin or
n-butyrate, further augmented the percentage of apoptotic
cells [12]. These findings suggest a potential role of GLS2
in anti-cancer therapies. In our study, the relative inhibitory
activities of the alkyl benzoquinones of glutaminase were
generally consistent with their respective activities for
anti-cancer cell growth (Table1, Table S1, and Figure
3B). Moreover, the GLS2 depletion in HepG2 cells also
diminished cell growth (Figure 3D). Furthermore, AV-1
and GLS2 depletion significantly suppressed the colony
formation of HepG2 (Figure 3C). Inhibition of glutaminase
activity in cancer cells by alkyl benzoquinones results
in a deficient nutrient supply (Figure 3E), which leads
to i) an AMPK-mediated moderate ULK1 activation; ii)
AMPK-mediated phosphorylations on Raptor Ser792 and
Tuberin Thr1387 and a PI3K/AKT inhibition mediated
dephosphorylation on Tuberin Thr1462, which results
in significant mTORC1 inhibition; and ultimately iii)
induction of autophagy (Figures 4 & 5). Therefore we
conclude that GAB/GLS2 inhibition plays a significant
role in the anti-cancer mechanisms for compound AV-1.
Glutaminase inhibitors are poorly explored, with
few classes of potent allosteric inhibitors identified, e.g.
BPTES and dibenzophenanthridine-968 compounds
[2-6, 10]. Co-crystallization data showed that BPTES
selectively inhibits GLS1 (KGA and GAC) via binding a
differentiated gating loop close to the glutamine substrate
binding site and exerting an allosteric effect to lock the
tetramer into a nonproductive conformation. The GAC
point mutants GAC F318Y/F322S and GAC Y394L
were resistant to BPTES inhibition indicating that these
interacting residues, Phe 322 and Tyr 394, are important
for BPTES selectivity [3]. Molecular docking studies were
conducted to locate potential dibenzophenanthridine-968

The cDNA clone MGC:33744 IMAGE:5263220
(Invitrogen Inc., USA) was used to amplify a KGA cDNA

containing BamHI and NotI, respectively, for subsequent
sub-cloning. The cDNA fragment of KGA digested
with BamHI and NotI at each end was ligated into the
pET28a(+) vector (Novagen) and expressed as a his-tag
fusion. Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS was
transformed with the resulting plasmid, pET28a(+)-KGA,
and then cultured in Luria-Bertani broth medium in the
presence of kanamycin. Once the cultures reached an
absorbance at 600 nm of 0.5 to 0.6, they were induced with
0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)
overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at
10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C and resuspended in lysis
buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 50 mM NaH2PO4, 300
mM NaCl and 10 mM imidazole) for sonication. The
filtered supernatant was applied to an affinity column,
HisTrapTM HP 1 x 5 mL (GE Healthcare), and washed
with lysis buffer containing 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol
(β–ME), 5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 100-150
mM imidazole. His-tagged KGA was eluted with lysis
buffer containing 10 mM β–ME, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton
X-100 and 500 mM imidazole. The eluted protein was
exchanged to 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl,
10% glycerol, and 2 mM dithiothreitol by using a PD-10
Desalting column (GE Healthcare). The concentration of
the purified protein was determined by use of the Bio-Rad
protein assay reagent with a standard curve plotted against
bovine serum albumin.
Equivalent construct of GAB (Pro56-Val602) was
amplified from the cDNA clone MGC: 195512 IMAGE:

Preparation of BPTES
The synthesis of BPTES was modified from one
previously published [41]. Step 1 Procedure: A mixture
of thiosemicarbazide (1.82 g, 20 mmol), thiodipropionic
acid (1.78 g, 10 mmol) and POCl3 (15 ml) was heated at
90 °C for 3 h. After obtaining a clear solution, the reaction
mixture was cooled and poured in to 100 g of ice. The solid
was filtered and the filtrate was adjusted to pH 14 using
5N NaOH. The resulting white solid was filtered, washed
with water and dried to give bis(aminothioldiazole) (2.3
g, 80%).
Step 2 Procedure: NaH (60%, 660 mg, 16.5 mmol)
was added to a solution of bis-(aminothioldiazole) (1.586
g, 5.5 mmol) in THF (200 mL) at 0°C. After being stirred
for 5 min, phenylacetyl chloride (2.2 mL, 16.5 mmol)
was added to the reaction mixture and the mixture was
continuously stirred at room temperature for 16 h. Water
was added to quench the reaction and the resulting mixture
was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layers were
washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered,
and concentrated in vacuo to furnish the crude BPTES.
The solid was redissolved in DMSO and triturated with
methanol to give BPTES as a white solid (518 mg, 18%)

20µg cell lysate, 0.2 mM EDTA , 50 mM Tris/acetate (pH
8.6), and 150 mM phosphate, was incubated at 37°C for 60
min and the reaction was stopped by 10 µl of 0.6 M HCl.
Subsequently, 30 µl of the stopped reaction was subjected
to the second reaction as described above for glutaminase
assay. Glutamate levels were measured by using the
Amplex Red Glutamine Acid/Glutamate oxidase assay kit
(Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Glutaminase activity assays and kinetic studies
Human glutaminase activity was measured using
a two-step assay as described previously [42, 43]. A
microtiter assay format was used to facilitate the collection
of multiple data points. Typically, 10 μl of compound,
which was dissolved in DMSO, was added to 80 μl of
an initial assay mix (0.1 mM hKGA, 0.2 mM EDTA and
50 mM Tris/acetate, pH 8.6). Samples were incubated at
25°C for 10 min and then 10 μl of 200 mM glutamine
were added to the reaction mix. After adding glutamine,
the reactions were incubated at 37°C for 60 min and
then quenched by the addition of 10 μl of 0.6 M HCl.
Subsequently, 100 μl of a second reaction mixture (3.7
units of purified bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase,
160 mM Tris/acetate [pH 9.4], 400 mM hydrazine, 5
mM ADP and 2 mM NAD+) was added to the stopped
first reaction mixture and incubated for 30 min at 25°C.
The absorbance at 340 nm was measured using a Wallac
Victor2V plate reader (PerkinElmer), fitted with a 340 nm
excitation filter. Sample absorbance was measured against
a blank, containing no human glutaminase.
The kinetic constants Km and Vmax were determined
by using Kaleida Graph software (Synergy Software)
to calculate a non-linear least-squares fit for all the
data points to the Michaelis–Menten equation. The Ki
values for AV-1 were determined by using the ChengPrusoff equation; Ki=IC50/(1 + [S]/Km) where [S] is the
concentration of the glutamine.

Mutagenesis and docking
Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the
pET28a(+)-GAB or pET28a(+)-KGA plasmids using
PfuUltra II Fusion HS DNA polymerase (Agilent
Technologies) to create the GAB and KGA mutants. The
deep view program (Version 3.7) of the Swiss-MODEL
server was used to generate the three dimensional structure
of homologous modeled GAB. Using the integrated
sequence alignment tools and structural superimposition
algorithms, the target sequence was mapped on the
modeling templates. The sequence alignment was
compared with crystal structure of the GAC (PDB code:
3UO9) and the resulting model of GAB was analyzed
using the Swiss-PDB server. Threading and folding
recognition of GAB model was developed by PHYRE2
web server. Docking studies were performed with
AutoDock Vina. Autodock input files were prepared
with MGLTools 1.5.6. Molecules were drawn in
ChemBioOffice 2010, and energy minimized using the
MM2 force field in Chemdraw 3D. Visualization was
performed with PyMOL 1.3, and graphics were prepared
in that software. SWISS MODEL: http://swissmodel.

GLS2 gene silencing

A549 lung carcinoma and HepG2 hepatocarcinoma
cells were seeded at 4000 and 10000 cells/well
respectively in 96-well plates, as previously described for
cell growth inhibition assay [27, 44]. To assess anchoragedependent colony formation effect, the cells (1000 cells/
well) were seeded in a six-well plate for 20-24 h prior to
treatments of vehicle DMSO or compounds as indicated.
Culture medium containing vehicle DMSO or compounds
as indicated was changed twice a week. After a 21-day
treatment, the cell colonies were rinsed with PBS, fixed in
3:1 ratio of methanol and acetic acid, stained with 0.05%
crystal violet.

Determination of intracellular

The knock down of GLS2 was carried out using two
distinct shRNA plasmids (clone ID: TRCN0000051323
and TRCN0000051327, Academia Sinica, Taiwan)
directed against the two isoforms of GLS2 enzyme (GAB
and LGA). The shRNA plasmid (TRCN0000231759,
Academia Sinica, Taiwan) against of GFP was as a
negative control. The shRNA plasmids were transfected
in A549 cells, or HepG2 cells using FuGene 6TM (Roche).
Stable cell clones were grown in the presence of 1 µg/mL
puromycin. Established cell lines were further verified by
anti-GAB western blot analysis to assess the cells growth.
