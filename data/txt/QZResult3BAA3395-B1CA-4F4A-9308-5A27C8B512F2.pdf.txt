Abstract

Author Manuscript

Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 14 (PTPN14) is frequently mutated in a variety of
human cancers. However, the cell signaling pathways regulated by PTPN14 largely remain to be
elucidated. Here, we identify a list of potential substrates of PTPN14 using a phospho-proteomic
approach. We show that p130Cas is a direct substrate of PTPN14 and that PTPN14 specifically
regulates p130Cas phosphorylation at tyrosine residue 128 (Y128) in colorectal cancer (CRC)
cells. We engineered CRC cells homozygous for a p130Cas Y128F knock-in mutant and found
that these cells exhibit significantly reduced migration and colony formation, impaired anchorageindependent growth, slower xenograft tumor growth in nude mice, and have decreased
phosphorylation of AKT. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SRC phosphorylates p130Cas Y128
and that CRC cell lines harboring high levels of pY128 Cas are more sensitive to SRC family
kinase inhibitor Dasatinib. These findings suggest that p130Cas Y128 phosphorylation may be
exploited as a predictive marker for Dasatinib response in cancer patients. In aggregate, our
studies reveal a novel signaling pathway that plays an important role in colorectal tumorigenesis.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Reversible tyrosine phosphorylation governs numerous signaling pathways that regulate cell
proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion and migration (1). Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is
coordinately controlled by protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein tyrosine
phosphatases (PTPs) (1). Many PTKs have been identified to be oncogenes that are crucial
to tumorigenic processes (2). Increasing evidence indicates that PTPs also play important
roles in tumorigenesis (3). In a systematic mutational analysis of the PTP gene family in
colorectal cancers (CRCs), protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 14 (PTPN14) was
identified as one of the six PTPs that are mutated in CRCs (4). Recent studies revealed that
PTPN14 is also mutated in breast, head and neck, kidney, liver, ovarian and skin cancers (5–
10), suggesting that PTPN14 may play an important role in tumorigenesis of multiple types
of cancers.

PTPN14, also known as Pez, PTP36 and PTPD2, consists of an N-terminal FERM (fourpoint-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin) domain and a C-terminal phosphatase domain (11). It has
been shown that PTPN14 may regulate cell-cell adhesion, cell-matrix adhesion, cell
migration and cell growth (12–14). Interestingly, a recent study indicates that PTPN14 also
regulates TGFβ gene expression, thereby modulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (15).
Knockdown of the PTPN14 homolog in zebrafish results in developmental defects (15).
Although PTPN14 was shown to regulate tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin (12), it
remains to be determined how this regulation impacts tumorigenesis. Given that PTPN14 is
mutated in various cancers including CRCs, it is important to identify more substrates of
PTPN14 in CRC cells. In this study, we identified a list of putative substrates of PTPN14
using a phospho-proteomic approach. We further validated p130 Crk-associated substrate
(p130Cas) as a critical PTPN14 substrate.

Author Manuscript

p130Cas was originally identified as a Crk-associated protein (16, 17). It is also known as
breast-cancer anti-estrogen resistance protein 1 (BCAR1), because p130Cas overexpression
renders breast cancer cells resistant to Tamoxifen treatment (18). Moreover, p130Cas is
overexpressed in a subset of breast cancers (19). Transgenic mice overexpressing p130Cas
shorten the latency of Her2/neu-induced breast cancer development (19). Furthermore,
p130Cas is required for SRC-mediated transformation (20, 21). Together, these studies
suggest that p130Cas is a key player in tumorigenesis. p130Cas is an adaptor protein that
mediates integrin and growth factor signaling (22). It contains several conserved domains
for protein-protein interactions. At the N-terminus, there is a substrate domain with 15
YXXP repeats which can be heavily phosphorylated (22). Here, we report that PTPN14
dephosphorylates the tyrosine 128 (Y128) residue, one of the YXXP repeats, on p130Cas.
We further demonstrated that regulation of Y128 p130Cas phosphorylation plays a critical
role in CRC tumorigenesis.

Results
Identification of p130Cas as a substrate of PTPN14 using a phospho-proteomic approach

Author Manuscript

To identify potential substrates of PTPN14, we constructed two stable SW480 CRC cell
lines expressing either a wild-type (WT) PTPN14 PTP domain or a PTPN14 D1079A
trapping mutant PTP domain. It is well documented that PTP trapping mutants can trap
phospho-substrates in their catalytic pockets and protect the substrates from
dephosphorylation, thereby potentially enriching the phospho-substrates (23, 24). Proteins
were extracted from these cell lines as well as the parental SW480 cells and digested with
trypsin. Phospho-tyrosine (pY) containing peptides were enriched using anti-pY antibody
columns. Peptides from each cell line were profiled by mass spectrometry analyses (Fig 1A).
pY peptides were quantified as described by Rush at al (25). Those pY containing peptides
that were either down-regulated in the cell lines overexpressing the WT phosphatase or upregulated in the cell line overexpressing the trapping mutant compared to the parental cells
are potential candidate substrates (Fig. 1B and Table S1). Of these candidate substrates, we
chose to further characterize p130Cas because the pY128 containing peptides of p130Cas
were enriched over 150 fold in the cell line overexpressing the PTPN14 trapping mutant
phosphatase (Fig. 1B).
PTPN14 regulates phosphorylation of p130 at the tyrosine 128 residue in CRC cells

Author Manuscript

We set out to determine if PTPN14 indeed regulates p130Cas Y128 phosphorylation. To this
end, we first generated a pY128 p130Cas specific antibody. As shown in Fig. S1, the
antibody recognized a phospho-signal on the wild-type p130Cas. In contrast, it failed to
detect any signal on p130Cas Y128F mutant protein (Fig. S1), indicating that this antibody
specifically recognizes phosphorylated Y128 of p130Cas. We then performed Western blot
analyses on the aforementioned SW480 CRC cell lines using this antibody. Consistent with
the proteomic data, compared to parental cells, overexpression of WT PTPN14 phosphatase
resulted in reduced levels of pY128 p130Cas (Fig. 2A), whereas overexpression of the
trapping mutant led to increased levels of this phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). Conversely,
knockdown of PTPN14 by two independent shRNAs resulted in increased levels of pY128
p130Cas in a genetically engineered DLD1 CRC cell line (Fig. 2B), in which the
endogenous PTPN14 proteins are epitope-tagged with 3xFLAG (26). Taken together, these
data demonstrated that PTPN14 regulates phosphorylation of p130Cas Y128 in CRC cells.
PTPN14 directly dephosphorylates p130Cas

Author Manuscript

To determine whether PTPN14 directly regulates p130Cas Y128 phosphorylation, we first
employed a substrate trapping assay developed by Flint et al. (23). WT or substrate trapping
mutant (D1079A) of PTPN14 phosphatase domain was fused to GST and expressed in E.
coli. GST fusion proteins were purified and attached on Glutathione beads. Equal amounts
of WT and mutant GST-fusion proteins were used for a trapping assay (Fig. 2C). As shown
in Fig. 2C and Fig S2, the trapping mutant fusion proteins pulled down p130Cas abundantly
from cell lysates made from two different CRC cell lines DLD1 and SW480. In contrast, the
WT GST-fusion proteins only pulled down minimal amount of p130Cas, whereas GST
alone did not bind to p130Cas. Secondly, when mixed with phosphorylated p130cas
substrates in vitro, the WT PTPN14 GST fusion proteins dephosphorylated p130Cas at the

Y128 site in comparison with controls with equal amounts of GST or the enzymatically
inactive mutant proteins (trapping mutant) (Fig. 2D). In aggregate, our results showed
unequivocally that p130Cas is a direct substrate of PTPN14. However, we failed to detect
protein-protein interaction between PTPN14 and p130Cas in DLD1 cell lysates by a coimmunoprecipitation assay (data not shown), suggesting that the two proteins only interact
transiently when the enzymatic reaction occurs.
SRC phosphorylates p130Cas at Tyr128

Author Manuscript

Having demonstrated that PTPN14 dephosphorylates Y128 of p130Cas, we set out to
identify the kinase that phosphorylates this site. Because SRC kinase has been shown to
phosphorylate p130Cas at several tyrosine residues other than Y128, we elected to test
whether SRC could also phosphorylate Y128 on p130Cas. Three lines of evidence indicated
that SRC indeed phosphorylates this site: (1) Treatment of DLD1 cells with a SRC inhibitor
AZD0530 led to dephosphorylation of pY128 p130Cas (Fig. 3A); (2) Knockdown of SRC
by two independent shRNAs also resulted in reduced levels of pY128 p130Cas in DLD1
cells (Fig. 3B); (3) Overexpression of SRC led to increased levels of pY128 on p130Cas
(Fig. 3C).
Colon cancer cell lines harboring higher levels of pY128 p130Cas are more sensitive to the
killing by SRC family kinase inhibitor Dasatinib

Author Manuscript

SRC family kinase inhibitor Dasatinib is used in clinic to treat chronic myelogenous
leukemia and there are several ongoing clinical trials using Dasatinib in combination with
other drugs to treat colon cancers (27). To test if p130Cas Y128 phosphorylation associates
with Dasatinib inhibition, we treated six colon cancer cell lines with various doses of
Dasatinib and the IC50s of these cell lines were shown in up panel of Fig. 3D. Remarkably,
colon cancer cell lines harboring higher levels of pY128 p130Cas were more sensitive to
growth inhibition by Dasatinib (Fig. 3D).
Phosphorylation of p130Cas Y128 can be stimulated by EGF

Author Manuscript

Given that we have identified the kinase and phosphatase that regulate p130Cas Y128
phosphorylation, it is of interest to identify stimuli that may activate this phosphorylation in
CRC cells. To this end, we treated DLD1 cells with various growth factors and cytokines
including EGF, FGF, PDGF-AA, Il-6, and VEGF. Among them, EGF could robustly
stimulate p130Cas Y128 phosphorylation after 30 minute treatment (Fig S3A). In contrast,
other growth factors and cytokines, including PDGF-AA, failed to activate p130Cas Y128
phosphorylation, although PDGF was able to activate ERK1/2 (Fig S3B). Furthermore, EGF
also induced phosphorylation of p130Cas Y128 in multiple CRC cells including RKO cells
(Fig. S3A). Given that EGF signaling plays a critical role in CRC tumorigenesis and that
anti-EGFR antibodies are approved by the FDA to treat CRC patients (28), we chose to
study p130Cas Y128 phosphorylation in the context of EGF stimulation.
Engineering p130Cas Y128F mutant knock-in (KI) CRC cells
To rigorously test whether regulation of p130Cas Y128 phosphorylation is critical to
colorectal tumorigenesis, we set out to engineer p130Cas Y128F knock-in (KI CRC) cell

lines. The adeno-associated virus (AAV) targeting system was used to engineer the knock-in
cell lines because of its high homologous recombination frequency in somatic cells (26, 29,
30). We first chose to knock in the p130Cas Y128F mutant allele into the human colon
cancer cell line RKO, because we had shown that p130Cas Y128 phosphorylation can be
activated by EGF in RKO cells as described above and that RKO cells are widely used for
gene targeting (31). The targeting strategy is outlined in the schematic diagram in Fig 4A.
After the first round of gene targeting, 7 targeted clones were identified out of 96 geneticin
resistant clones screened. To ensure the presence of the mutant allele, genomic PCR
products of exon 3, which encodes the Y128 residue, from the targeted clones were
sequenced. Five of the 7 targeted clones harbored p130Cas Y128F mutant allele. Two clones
were infected with adenovirus expressing Cre-recombinase to excise the neomycin
resistance gene (Fig. 4A) and targeted for the second allele to generate homozygous KI
clones. To confirm that there was no WT p130Cas allele expression in the homozygous
p130Cas Y128F mutant clones, the genomic PCR products of p130Cas were sequenced. As
expected, both WT p130Cas alleles were replaced by the p130Cas Y128F mutants in the
homozygous KI clones (Fig 4B). Furthermore, Western blot analyses showed that p130Cas
proteins were expressed in the homozygous KI cells but they remained unphosphorylated at
residue 128 after EGF stimulation, while p130Cas proteins in the parental cells were heavily
phosphorylated at Y128 post EGF stimulation (Fig. 4C). These data indicated that we had
successfully engineered p130Cas Y128F mutant KI cells. We chose two independently
derived heterozygous and homozygous KI clones for in-depth analyses and both clones
behaved similarly in all the studies described below. To ensure that what we observe with
RKO cells is not cell line specific, we used the same method to generate p130Cas Y128F
mutant DLD1 cells (Fig. 4).

Author Manuscript

In vitro, p130Cas Y128F mutant CRC cells are reduced in properties predicative of in vivo
tumorigenicity
When grown under normal tissue culture conditions (McCoy’s 5A supplemented with
10%FBS), the average doubling times of the DLD1 p130Cas Y128F mutant clones
increased by 1.5 hours in comparison to the parental cells (Fig. S4), whereas no doubling
time difference was observed between RKO parental and the mutant clones (Fig. S4). Cell
cycle profiling showed slightly increased G1 populations in the p130Cas Y128F
homozygous KI clones derived from both DLD1 and RKO cells (Fig S5).

Author Manuscript

To test whether p130Cas Y128F mutant affects tumorigenicity correlated responses in vitro,
we performed colony formation and soft agar assays with the p130Cas mutant KI cells.
Compared to the parental cells, homozygous p130Cas Y128F KI RKO and DLD1 cells
exhibited 3–6 fold (p < 0.001) reduced abilities to form colonies in colony-formation assays
(Fig. 5A). Similarly, homozygous p130Cas mutant CRC cell clones formed ~25 fold (p <
0.001) less foci in soft agar assay than their wild-type counterparts (Fig. 5B). Interestingly,
the RKO heterozygous KI clones, but not these of DLD1 heterozygous KI clones, displayed
significant (p < 0.001) reduction in colony numbers and soft-agar foci with respect to wildtype cells (Fig. 5A and B).

The p130Cas mutant RKO cells were less tumorigenic in vivo

Author Manuscript

Tumorigenicity of the KI cells was also tested in a more stringent in vivo model. For these
studies, p130Cas Y128F homozygous, heterozygous clones or the parental RKO and DLD1
cells were injected subcutaneously into nude mice. After 35 days of growth, wild-type cells
formed tumors in all mice injected, whereas the p130Cas Y128F homozygous RKO KI
clones failed to form tumors in two of the five mice injected (Fig. 6A). The average tumor
volumes of p130Cas Y128F homozygous RKO KI clones were 30-fold smaller than those
produced by the parental cells (p < 0.001) (Fig. 6B). However, no significant difference in
xenograft tumor growth was observed between the DLD1 homozygous KI clones and the
parental (Fig. S6). Both RKO and DLD1 heterozygous KI clones formed similar sizes of
tumors to those of parental cells (Fig. 6A and B, and Fig. S6).
The p130Cas Y128F mutant CRC cells display defects in cell spreading and migration

Author Manuscript

Given that both PTPN14 and p130Cas are involved in cell adhesion and migration (11, 22),
we set out to determine how p130Cas Y128 phosphorylation impacts cancer cell adhesion
and migration. Boyden chamber cell migration assay showed that the p130Cas Y128F
mutant cells exhibited significantly reduced ability in cell migration (Fig. S7). When grown
on cover slips coated with fibronectin, the majority of parental RKO and DLD1 cells spread
fully and displayed a fibroblast-like morphology (Fig. S8 A and B). In contrast, most of the
p130Cas Y128F DLD1 mutant cells were not fully-spreading (Fig. 7A and B). The
percentages of fully-spreading mutant RKO cells were also significantly reduced, although
not as dramatic as the mutant DLD1 cells. However, no apparent focal adhesion defect was
observed with the mutant cells (Fig. S8A).
AKT signaling is impaired in the p130Cas Y128F mutant KI cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We demonstrated that phosphorylation of the p130Cas Y128 residue plays an important role
in colorectal tumorigenesis. To gain insights into the effects of this phosphorylation on
downstream signaling, we examined how the p130Cas Y128F KI affects phosphorylation of
signaling molecules in CRC cells after EGF stimulation. It is well-documented that EGF
receptors, once they are engaged by their ligands, activate multiple well-characterized
signaling pathways including Ras-MAPK, PI3K-AKT, PLC-γ and STATs (32). We tested
the phosphorylation status of 27 sites on 16 proteins that could be potentially modulated by
EGF signaling (Table S2). In both RKO and DLD1 CRC cells, phosphorylation of AKT
Thr308 was significantly reduced in p130Cas Y128F KI cells in comparison with the
parental cells (Fig. 7A and B). However, the kinetics of AKT activation appeared to be
faster in RKO cells than in DLD1 cells (Fig. 7A and B). Although no difference in ERK1/2
phosphorylation was observed between the RKO parental and Y128F KI cells, ERK1/2
phosphorylation levels were elevated in DLD1 p130Cas Y128F mutant cells, suggesting that
a compensatory effect occurred in the DLD1 mutant cells.
The p130Cas Y128F mutant proteins bind less p85 than the WT p130Cas
The above results indicate that AKT is a critical downstream mediator of the p130Cas
pY128 signaling. It is well documented that AKTs are activated by phosphatidylinositol 3kinase (PI3K) (33). PI3K, which consists of a p85 regulatory subunit and a p110 catalytic

subunit (34), converts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol
3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (33, 34). PIP3 then recruits AKT the plasma membrane, which, in
turn, activates AKT (34). PI3K becomes activated when it is recruited to the membrane by
interaction between p85 and pY residues on membrane-bound receptors or adaptor proteins
(34). Interestingly, several studies demonstrate that membrane-associated p130Cas activates
PI3K through interaction with p85 (35, 36) and that this interaction is dependent on tyrosine
phosphorylation of the substrate-binding domain on p130Cas (35). Given that the Y128
belongs to one of the YXXP repeats (22), we postulated that the reduced AKT activity in the
p130Cas Y128F mutant cells might be due to weaker binding affinity of the mutant p130Cas
protein to p85. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 7C, less p85 proteins associated with the p130Cas
Y128F mutant compared to the WT p130Cas. In contrast, the p130Cas Y128F mutation did
not affect its binding with CRK, a known p130Cas interacting protein (Fig. 7C) (16, 17).
Under these conditions, we failed to detect protein interactions between p130Cas and focal
adhesion kinase (FAK).

Discussion
Using a phospho-proteomic approach, we identified and validated p130Cas as a substrate of
PTPN14. PTPN14 dephosphorylates an unappreciated Y128 residue on p130Cas protein.
PTPN14 regulated p130Cas Y128 phosphorylation plays an important role in colorectal
tumorigenesis, because the genetically engineered p130Cas Y128F mutant CRC cells exhibit
reduced abilities in colony formation, anchorage-independent growth, cell migration and
xenograft tumor growth.

Author Manuscript

PTPN14 is identified to be mutated in various human cancers including breast, colon, head
and neck, kidney, liver, ovarian and skin cancers (4–10), thereby providing genetic evidence
suggesting that this PTP plays a role in tumorigenesis. In a fraction of tumors, one allele of
PTPN14 is mutated whereas the other allele is lost (4), consistent with a “two-hit” tumor
suppressor model. Therefore we postulate that PTPN14 may function as a tumor suppressor.
Consistent with this notion, PTPN14 negatively regulates an oncogenic target pY128
p130Cas, because the unphosphorylatable p130Cas Y128F KI DLD1 and RKO cells exhibit
reduced colony formation ability and soft-agar growth (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the RKO
p130Cas Y128F mutant cells grow much slower as xenograft tumors, although the p130Cas
Y128F mutation in DLD1 cell does not affect xenograft tumor growth. We hypothesize that
this discrepancy is due to a compensatory effect in the DLD1 p130Cas mutant cells. In
support, we observed that ERK activities are up-regulated in the DLD1 p130Cas mutant KI
cells, but not in the RKO mutant KI cells (Fig. 7A and B).

Author Manuscript

We also demonstrated that SRC is the kinase that phosphorylates p130Cas Y128 residue
(Fig. 3). Interestingly, CRC cell lines harboring high levels of pY128 p130Cas are more
sensitive to SRC inhibitor Dasatinib-induced growth inhibition than those cell lines with low
levels of pY128 p130Cas (Fig. 3D). Dasatinib is used in the clinic to treat chronic
myelogenous leukemia, and there are several ongoing clinical trials using Dasatinib in
combination with other drugs to treat solid tumors including colon cancers (27). Our data
suggest that pY128 p130Cas may be exploited as a prediction marker for Dasatinib response
in cancer patients. It is worth noting that Src also phosphorylates other sites of the YXXP

repeats on p130Cas including the Y253 that regulate transformed cell growth and migration
(37, 38). As the future directions, it is of interest to determine if PTPN14 dephosphorylates
the other sites and if there is a cross-talk between the Y128 phosphorylation and the other Y
residues of the YXXP repeats.
The oncogenic signaling of p130Cas Y128 phosphorylation seems to be mediated by the
PI3K/AKT pathway, as we showed that AKT T308 phosphorylation, a key to AKT
activation, is reduced in both DLD1 and RKO p130Cas Y128 mutant KI cells (Fig. 7A and
B). It has been reported previously that p130cas can activate PI3K through binding to the
regulatory subunit p85 (35, 36). Here, we demonstrate that p130Cas pY128 phosphorylation
is crucial for its binding to p85. Although the p130Cas interacting protein CRK is shown to
activate PI3K through the FAK-p85 interaction (39), our results indicate that the p130Cas
Y128F mutant does not affect its binding to CRK.

Author Manuscript

Lastly, the phospho-proteomic approach used in this study represents a novel method to
globally identify potential substrates of PTPs. Identification of substrates of PTPs has been a
challenge. Although phosphatase trapping pull-down has been widely used to validate PTP
substrates, it has limited success in identification of new substrates (40). We show here that,
coupling with global phospho-proteomic profiling, overexpression of the trapping mutant
PTPN14 PTP domain can enrich the target pY containing peptides and provides a systematic
approach to identify candidate substrates. We also successfully employed a similar method
to identify substrates of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor T (PTPRT) (41). We further
validated that STAT3 and paxillin are the substrates of PTPRT (41, 42). Therefore, our
studies suggest that the phospho-proteomic approach is a generally applicable method for
identification of PTP substrates.

Profiling pY Peptides

Author Manuscript

Cell lysates were prepared under denaturing conditions in the presence of phosphatase
inhibitors (20 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 9 M urea, 1mM sodium vanadate). Following trypic
digestion, peptides were concentrated and partitioned into three fractions by reversed-phase
solid-phase extraction. The phosphopeptides from each fraction were bound to agarose

washing, peptides were eluted from the immobilized antibody with dilute acid and analyzed
by nanoflow LC-MS/MS using an ion trap mass spectrometer. Lists of credible
phosphopeptide sequence assignments were assembled.

Phosphatase Substrate Trapping Assay

Author Manuscript

Substrate trapping was performed as described (41) and modified as follows. Ten million
cells were treated with 100 μM pervanadate for 30 min and collected by centrifugation. The
cell pellet was lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1%
Nonidet P-40, 1x complete protease inhibitor cocktail, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM Benzmidine),
treated with 5 mM iodoacetic acid on ice for 5 min, neutralized by addition of 10 mM DTT
for 15 min, and subjected to centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min to remove debris. GSTPTPN14 bound beads were incubated with this lysate at 4°C for 1 h. The beads were
pelleted and washed three times for 5 min with lysis buffer supplemented with 1 mM DTT.
The beads were then boiled and aliquots analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.
In Vitro Phosphatase Assay
HEK293T cells overexpressing FLAG-tagged p130Cas proteins were treated with 50 μM
pervanadate for 30 min and lysed in RIPA buffer. Cas proteins were immunoprecipitated
with anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose beads. The immune complexes were washed
twice in wash buffer (50 mM Tris·HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA,1% Nonidet

P-40) with the phosphatase inhibitors (10 mM NaF and 2 mM Na3VO4), twice in the same
buffer without the phosphatase inhibitors, once in ST buffer (50 mM Tris·HCl pH 7.4, 150
mM NaCl) and once in phosphatase assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5
mM DTT). The p130 Cas immunocomplexes were then incubated with equal amounts of
either GST alone, GST-PTPN14, or the trapping mutant at 37°C for 30 min. Western blots
were performed to quantitate p130Cas pY128.
shRNA knockdown
shRNA lentiviral vectors were purchased from Sigma. Lentiviruses were packaged in
HEK-293T cells with the transfection of lentiviral vectors together with pMD2.G VSVG and
pCMV delta R8.74. 24 hrs after transfection, lentiviruses were harvested and purified and
then were used to transduce DLD1 cells. Stable clones were then selected in medium
containing 2.5 μg/ml of puromycin.

Targeted Knock-in of p130Cas Y128F mutant Allele

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Somatic cell gene targeting was performed as described (26). Briefly, a 1.3 KB fragment
from intron 2 to intron 3 of the p130Cas locus containing the exon 3 sequences was
amplified 20 cycles from genomic DNA using primers 5′-gggaaag/deoxyU/
gggtttgctgagggcgacggg -3′ and 5′-ggagaca/deoxyU/ggtgattgagggtggctgggccctt-3′. The
coding sequences for Y128 were then mutated from TAC (Tyr) to TTC (Phe) by sitedirected mutagenesis using primers 5′-ggctcagcaaggcctcttccaagtcccgggtcccag -3′ and 5′aagaggccttgctgagcc -3′. This mutated fragment was used as the left homologous arm.
Another 1.0 KB fragment from intron 3 of the p130Cas gene was also amplified 20 cycles
from genomic DNA as the right arm using primers 5′-ggtccca/deoxyU/
ggcattccaggagtggctgtg-3′ and 5′-ggcatag/deoxyU/gttcatctgtgtggggtgtggg-3′. The left and
right homologous arms were cloned into pAAV-USER-Neo-LoxP vector using USER
system as previously described. The targeting AAV viruses were packaged in 293T cells (a
T75 flask at 70% confluence) by transfecting equal amounts of the targeting vector, pHelper
and pRC plasmids (3 μg each). Viruses were harvested 72 hours post-transfection. DLD1
and RKO cells were infected with the p130Cas knock-in targeting viruses and selected with
geneticin for 20 days. The geneticin resistant clones were then screened for homologous
recombination by 35 cycles of genomic PCR with primers derived from the neomycin
resistance gene 5′-gttgtgcccagtcatagccg-3′ and the upstream region of the left homologous
arm 5′-gggccacatggagcacgtacc -3′. Confirmatory genomic PCR was also performed with
positive clones identified using primers derived from the neomycin resistant gene (5′tctggattcatcgactgtgg-3′) and the downstream region of the right homologous arm (5′gcatgggtgttcgtatctgtgg-3′). The DNA fragments from the screening PCRs were then
sequenced to ensure the presence of the mutant Y128F alleles. In order to target the second
allele with the same targeting virus, correctly targeted clones were infected with
adenoviruses expressing the Cre-recombinase to delete the drug selection marker. To select
clones with successful deletion of the drug selection marker, 30 cycles of genomic PCR
were performed to amplify a ~200 bp genomic fragment in which the Lox P site was
inserted (using primers 5′-cacgcagctgggagggcacgaag-3′ and 5′-ctctgggtccattcacatccatc 3′).
The heterozygous KI clones were infected with the same targeting virus to target the second
allele and the neomycin resistance gene was excised as described above.

Colony formation assay

Author Manuscript

DLD1 and RKO cells were trypsinized, counted twice using a hemocytometer, and placed
into 6-well plates at 200 cells per well. Cells were grown for 14 days before staining with
Crystal Violet (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The experiment was repeated three times with two
replicates each. Average numbers of colonies from each experiment were plotted.
Focus Formation Assay in Soft agar

Author Manuscript

Soft agar assays were performed as described (43). Briefly, DLD1 and RKO clones were
trypsinized, counted twice using a hemocytometer, and plated at 5000 cells/ml in top plugs
consisting of 0.4% SeaPlaque agarose (FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, Maine) and McCoy’s
5A medium. After 30 days, the colonies were photographed and counted. The experiment
was repeated three times with two replicates each. Average numbers of colonies from each
experiment were plotted.
Xenografts
Five million cells were injected subcutaneously and bilaterally into 4- to 6- week old female
nude mice (5 nude mice in each group). Tumor formation and size were assessed by weekly
caliper measurements of the length and width of the tumors. Tumor volumes were calculated
using the formula: Volume = (width)2 × length/2. After 35 days, the mice were sacrificed
and tumors were harvested.
Focal Adhesion Assay

Author Manuscript

Focal adhesion assay was performed using the Acitn Cytoskeleton and Focal Adhesion
Staining Kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were
seeded on coverslips treated with Fibronectin. The next day, cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde in 1X PBS for 15 mins and washed once. Cells were then permeabilized
with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1XPBS for 5 mins and washed twice. Cells were incubated in
anti-Vinculin antibody (1:200 dilution) for 1 hour and followed by three washes. Cells were
then incubated in Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (1:400) and TRITC-conjugated
Phalloidin (1:250) for 1 hour and were washed three times. Coverslips were mounted on a
slide and were visualized under Zeiss LSM 510 Confocal Microscope.
Boyden Chamber Cell Migration Assay

Author Manuscript

Transwell membranes (pore size 8.0 μm; Corning Incorporated., Corning, NY) were coated
with 50 μg/ml fibronectin. Cells were detached with 2 mM EDTA and re-suspended in
serum-free medium with 0.1% of BSA. Five hundred thousand cells were added to the upper
compartment of the transwell chamber in the wells of a 24-well plate and allowed to migrate
to the underside of the inserts for 24 hours. Non-migrating cells on the upper membrane
were removed with a cotton swab, and cells that had migrated and become attached to the
bottom surface of the membranewere fixed and stained with crystal violet. Migrated cells
were counted microscopically. The experiments were repeated three times with two
replicates for each cell line. Average numbers of migrated cells from each experiment were
plotted.

(A) Overexpression of WT PTPN14 PTP domain decreases p130Cas Y128 phosphorylation,
whereas the trapping mutant enriches pY128 Cas in CRC cells. Cell lysates made from the
cell lines used in Fig. 1 were blotted with the indicated antibodies. (B) Knock-down of
PTPN14 leads to increased levels of pY128 Cas in CRC cells. Cell lysates from stable
clones of DLD1 CRC cells expressing scramble shRNAs or shRNAs against PTPN14 were
blotted with the indicated antibodies. N14-1 and N14-2 are two independent shRNAs against
PTPN14. (C) A PTPN14 trapping mutant traps p130Cas protein. GST, GST-WT and GSTD1079A trapping mutant PTPN14 PTP domains were expressed in E. Coli, purified and
resolved on a SDS-PAGE gel (bottom panel). Arrow indicates the GST fusion proteins.
Equal amounts of the purified protein were mixed with DLD1 cell lysates in the phosphatase
trapping assay. The trapped p130Cas proteins were detected by Western blot (top panel).
(D). PTPN14 dephosphorylates pY128 Cas in vitro. Phosphorylated p130Cas proteins were
incubated with the indicated GST fusion proteins. The pY128 Cas proteins were quantified
by Western blot analysis.

harboring high levels of pY128 Cas are more sensitive to SRC inhibitor Dasatinib-induced
growth inhibition. The indicated CRC cell lines are treated with a serial concentration of
Dasatinib. The IC50s of each cell line from three independent experiments are plotted. The
