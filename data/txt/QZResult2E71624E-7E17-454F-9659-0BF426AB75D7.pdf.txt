Abstract
Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA, CD66e, CEACAM-5) is a cell-surface–bound glycoprotein overexpressed and
released by many solid tumors that has an autocrine function in cancer cell survival and differentiation. Soluble
CEA released by tumors is present in the circulation of patients with cancer, where it is used as a marker for
cancer progression, but whether this form of CEA exerts any effects in the tumor microenvironment is
unknown. Here, we present evidence that soluble CEA is sufﬁcient to induce proangiogenic endothelial cell
behaviors, including adhesion, spreading, proliferation, and migration in vitro and tumor microvascularization
in vivo. CEA-induced activation of endothelial cells was dependent on integrin b-3 signals that activate the focaladhesion kinase and c-Src kinase and their downstream MAP–ERK kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinase
and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt effector pathways. Notably, while interference with VEGF signaling had no
effect on CEA-induced endothelial cell activation, downregulation with the CEA receptor in endothelial cells
attenuated CEA-induced signaling and tumor angiogenesis. Corroborating these results clinically, we found that
tumor microvascularization was higher in patients with colorectal cancer exhibiting higher serum levels of
soluble CEA. Together, our results elucidate a novel function for soluble CEA in tumor angiogenesis. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Tumor angiogenesis is induced when the net balance of proand antiangiogenic molecules is tipped in favor of angiogenesis, resulting in the "angiogenic switch" (1, 2). Targeting
angiogenesis has led to improved prognosis in many cancers,
including those originating from colon, lung, brain, ovary, and
kidney (3). As VEGF represent the main proangiogenic stimulus (1), this system is currently in focus for therapeutic
interventions and has led to several U.S. Food and Drug
Administration–approved drugs in the treatment of cancer
(4). Nevertheless, the use of speciﬁc VEGF-targeting drugs has
been shown to be effective only for certain patients and for a

limited duration of time (5, 6), which might lie in the fact that
tumor angiogenesis is not only induced by VEGF, but also by a
variety of other factors (3, 7, 8).
To monitor adenocarcinoma growth as well as efﬁcacy of its
treatment, soluble CD66e/CEA—the product of the CEACAM5-gene (9)—is in routine clinical use. Under physiologic
conditions, only low amounts of soluble carcinoembryonic
antigen (CEA; 5 ng/mL) can be detected in serum. However,
in many different cancers, CEA is highly upregulated, but no
clear biologic role has emerged so far. Only recently, autocrine
CEA signaling in cancer cells was described to inhibit tumor
cell differentiation and apoptosis in vitro (10–12) and in vivo
(13). Although CEA is highly released by tumor cells, paracrine
effects of soluble CEA have hitherto not been described. As CEA
is a glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored protein lacking a
cytoplasmic domain, transmembrane interaction partners are
required for mediating intracellular signal transduction. In this
context, a colocalization of CEA with integrins in lipid rafts was
observed, which modulated integrin-dependent signaling
pathways, including integrin-linked kinase, phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K), and AKT (14, 15).
We were referred to a potential paracrine function of CEA in a
previous CEA-mimotope immunization study (16). In this particular study, CEA was the immunologic target of a CEA-directed
mimotope vaccination, resulting in a signiﬁcantly reduced
growth of CEA-expressing tumor transplants (Meth-A/CEA).
We now observed that CEA-mimotope–immunized mice had
signiﬁcantly lower vascular density as well as signiﬁcantly
decreased vessel area in tumor transplants, when compared
with tumors in non-CEA–vaccinated mice (Supplementary

CEA Affects Angiogenesis

Fig. S1). These data suggested CEA as a potential novel stimulus
in tumor angiogenesis.
In the present study, we aimed to analyze whether CEA
exerts a so far unknown function in tumor angiogenesis. In
detail, we aimed (i) to analyze any direct effects of exogenous
CEA on endothelial cells by in vivo angiogenesis assays as well
as by in vitro analyses of endothelial cell behavior, (ii) to
characterize potential CEA-induced effects on intracellular
signal transduction in endothelial cells, (iii) to identify mechanisms responsible for CEA-induced endothelial cell activation
and, ﬁnally, (iv) to analyze the role of CEA-expression in gainand loss-of-function in in vivo tumor transplant models.

Materials and Methods
A detailed description is given in the Supplementary Data.
Immunoblotting and Western blot analyses
Standard procedures were used (17, 18).
Integrin activity assays
Binding of 2 mmol/L ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–
labeled cyclic-RGD (Anaspect; Supplementary Fig. S4) or
WOW-1 Fab (100 nmol/L; kindly gift from Sanford Shattil,
University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA; ref. 19) to
human microvascular endothelial cells (HUMEC) was assessed
by ﬂow cytometry (FACScan; BD). Brieﬂy, HUMECs [serumfree condition; 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)] were incubated with CEA (10 ng/mL, 30 minutes) or MnCl2 (Mnþþ; 1
mmol/L) to activate integrins (20). Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated
anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG; 1:500) as secondary antibody and propidium iodide (2 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) were
used. Three independent experiments were performed.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (21). Endothelial cell staining was performed by antiendomucin (eBioscience; displayed in ﬁgures), anti-CD31 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-vWF (Abcam) antibodies. Colorectal cancer tumor tissue sections were derived from the Department of Clinical Pathology, Medical University of Vienna,
Vienna, Austria. As expected, no soluble CEA was detected on
endothelial cells in tumor tissue sections as standard procedures
of immunohistochemical analyses include acid treatment.
In vivo tumor transplant models
Cell lines used were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection. Meth-A/CEA cells or control Meth-A/wt cells were
transplanted into BALB/c mice (Institute of Laboratory Animal
Science, Vienna, Austria) by subcutaneous injection into the
right ﬂank, 6 animals/group. Alternatively, NSG mice [NODscid-gamma (NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ)] from The Jackson Laboratory were used to exclude natural killer (NK) cell or
cytokines involvement for CEA effects (22). In xenotransplant
assays, Caki2/mock (control) or Caki2/CEA (stably overexpressing CEA) tumor cells were injected into the nude mice
(Institute of Laboratory Animal Science). After 8 or 21 days,
mice were sacriﬁced and tumors were explanted. Parafﬁnembedded tumor tissue samples from the spontaneous gastric
tumor model were derived from CEA424/SV40T-antigen trans-

genic mice  a human CEA transgene (23–25). Carcinomas
were obtained from eight different 13-week-old mice (4
CEA424/Tag- and 4 CEA424/Tag-CEA double-transgenic
mice). Only tumors of same sizes were analyzed for angiogenesis (as described above).
Aortic ring assay
Aortic ring explants of 6- to 12-week-old C57BL/6 mice were
placed on a growth factor–reduced Matrigel supplemented with
3% BSA containing medium  CEA (100 ng/mL) or VEGF
(30 ng/mL). After 6 days, a software-based (ImageJ 1.32) computer-assisted method, which measured the number and length
of vessels, was used. Supernatants of Meth-A/CEA cells adjusted
to 100 ng/mL CEA were incubated with either IgG- or anti-CEA
beads before used in the aortic-ring assay. Similar method as
used in Supplementary Fig. S3C; CEA-level of Meth-A/wt:
0 ng/mL. Quantiﬁcation is given in bars; error bars, SD; n ¼ 3.
Directed in vivo angiogenesis assay
Directed in vivo angiogenesis assay (DIVAA; Trevigen) was
performed according to the manufacturer's protocol with modiﬁcations: CEA (1 mg/mL) or BSA 1% (control) was added. Two
reactors were implanted into the ﬂank of 6- to 8-week-old,
anesthetized (Ketamin, Xylen) BL6 mice, 8 reactors/group. On
day 11, mice were sacriﬁced and analyzed by immunoﬂuorescence, 7-mm cryostat sections. Functional (perfused) vessels
were identiﬁed by Hoechst 33342-dye staining (Supplementary
Data) and analyzed by Olympus-AX70 microscope and quantiﬁed by Cell-imaging software (Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions).
Proliferation and endothelial cell transmigration assay
Serum-deprived HUMECs were incubated with VEGF165
(10 ng/mL) or CEA (conc. as indicated)  inhibitors. The
number of attached endothelial cells per unit was counted after
24 hours. Alternatively, MTT assays (Promega) were performed
according to the manufacturer's instruction (n  3). Cell migration was assayed in a modiﬁed Boyden chamber system by using
Transwell membranes (8 mm) coated with 1% gelatin (Supplementary Data).
Cell adhesion and cell spreading assays
Assays of cell spreading on 20 mg/mL ﬁbrinogen or 10 mg/mL
ﬁbronectin (Sigma-Aldrich) were performed as described previously (26).
Statistical analysis
Statistical signiﬁcance was analyzed by un-/paired t test
when one group was compared with the control group. To
compare two or more groups with the control group, one-way
ANOVA and Dunnett tests as posttests were used. Signiﬁcance
was assessed to P values of less than 0.05.

Results
CEA directly affects proangiogenic endothelial cell
behavior
On the basis of the observation of reduced angiogenesis in
CEA-immunized mice (16) and the clinical correlation of high
CEA with worse prognosis in patients with cancer (27), we

postulated that tumor-associated CEA might affect the tumor
microenvironment, thereby activating endothelial cells and
enhance angiogenesis. To test this possibility, we ﬁrst analyzed
potential effects of CEA on endothelial cell proliferation, an
essential step in angiogenesis. We found that CEA induced a
signiﬁcant dose-dependent increase in endothelial cell proliferation, starting at concentrations of 80 ng/mL (Fig. 1A).
Notably, simultaneous stimulation of endothelial cells with
CEA and VEGF led to a partially additive effect on proliferative
activity (Fig. 1B). As endothelial cell migration represents
another important step in angiogenesis, we next analyzed
direct effects of CEA on the migratory response using an in
vitro Transwell migration assay. CEA led to an increase in
endothelial cell transmigration starting at concentrations of 10
ng/mL (Fig. 1C). Concomitant stimulation by CEA and VEGF
resulted in an additional migratory response (not shown). On
the basis of results of the in vitro endothelial cell transmigration assay, we studied endothelial cell invasion in vivo using
the in vivo Matrigel plug assay (Supplementary Fig. S2A)
showing a 2.36-  0.29-fold or 2.90-  0.59-fold increase in
invaded endothelial cells whenever CEA (1 mg/mL) or VEGF
(300 ng/mL) was embedded when compared with control
(1% BSA; P < 0.01). In an aortic ring ex vivo assay, we found
that the addition of CEA or VEGF led to increase in the mean
length of sprouts (128.0  18.1 mm or 155.7  23.1 mm) when
compared with 3% BSA (control). Addition of supernatants
from CEA-expressing tumor cells (Meth-A/CEA) provoked
endothelial sprouting, which was reverted by a pull-down of
CEA in supernatants (Fig. 1D). We next introduced a DIVAA
(Fig. 1E). Incorporation of CEA (1 mg/mL) into the matrix led to
an increase in invaded endothelial cells after 11 days. Furthermore, the number of Hoechst 33342–positive cells—representing the area of perfusion—was signiﬁcantly higher whenever
CEA was present (CEA: 0.7680.236 mm2 vs. control:
0.1200.012 mm2 for control; P ¼ 0.02). Taken together, these
data suggest that CEA directly induces proangiogenic endothelial cell behavior in vitro and in vivo.
CEA induces intracellular signal transduction in
endothelial cells
Next, we determined whether CEA mediates its effects on
endothelial cells by activating intracellular signaling pathways.
First, we tested its effects on the mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK,
p44/p42 MAPK) signaling pathway, which mainly regulates
cellular proliferation and differentiation (28). We found that
CEA induced p44/p42 MAPK phosphorylation in a MAP–ERK
kinase-1/2 (MEK1/2)–dependent manner, as phosphorylation
was blocked by the MEK-inhibitor U0126 (Fig. 2A). Thereby,
p44/p42 MAPK phosphorylation was time- (Fig. 2B) and dosedependent (Fig. 2C) with a signiﬁcant increase starting at CEA
concentrations of 10 ng/mL and reaching its maximum after
15 minutes. Moreover, stimulation of endothelial cells by CEA
led to activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway (Fig. 2D), which
represents another important angiogenic intracellular signaling pathway affecting mainly cell growth, proliferation, motility, and survival (29). Again, Akt activation was time- (Fig. 2E)
and dose-dependent (Fig. 2F) with maximal Akt phosphory-

lation occurring at 15 minutes. In summary, these data suggest
that exogenous CEA affects major intracellular signaling pathways in endothelial cells.
When we interfered with these signaling pathways in endothelial cell migration and proliferation assays, we found that
CEA-induced endothelial cell proliferation was dependent on
MEK activity, while Akt inhibition only partially and not
signiﬁcantly inhibited CEA-induced endothelial cell proliferation (Fig. 2G). CEA-induced endothelial cell migration, however, was dependent on both pathways, the MEK/ERK as well
as the PI3K/Akt pathway, because speciﬁc inhibitors of these
pathways were capable of blocking any CEA-induced endothelial cell migration (Fig. 2H).
CEA-induced intracellular signal transduction is
independent of the VEGF/VEGFR-1/2 system
Anti-VEGF/VEGFR system therapies have been introduced
for the treatment of several human cancers. Although this has
been proven as successful for patients for a limited duration of
time, a substantial fraction of patients with cancer ﬁnally
becomes resistant to VEGF-based therapies (30). Therefore,
it was important to elucidate whether VEGF/VEGFR-1/2 signaling is involved in CEA-induced endothelial cell activation.
CEA-induced p44/p42 MAPK phosphorylation in endothelial
cells remained unaffected by CBO-P11 (31), a speciﬁc inhibitor
of VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-1/2 (Fig. 3A). Notably, the inhibitory effect of CBO-P11 on VEGF was temporal and partially
reverted after 2 hours (Fig. 3B). Consistently, the VEGF-blocking antibody bevacizumab did not affect CEA-induced p44/p42
MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). Inhibition of VEGF binding
to VEGFR-1/2 using CBO-P11 (31) had no effect on CEAinduced endothelial cell migration, further indicating a
VEGF-independent activity of CEA. Similar results were
obtained by the addition of the functional-blocking antiVEGFR-2 antibody (500 ng/mL; Fig. 3D). Furthermore, CEA
failed to activate VEGFR-2/ﬂk-1 (Fig. 3E). These results demonstrate that the VEGF/VEGFR-1/2 system seems to be dispensable for CEA-induced endothelial cell activation in vitro.
Integrin adhesion receptors participate in CEA-induced
activation of endothelial cells
CEA-mediated modulation of integrin-dependent signal
transduction has been reported to occur in tumor cells (14),
which seems to be facilitated by colocalization of CEA and
integrins in the same subcellular lipid rafts (15). Therefore, we
were interested to test a potential role of integrins in CEAinduced endothelial cell activation. Whenever endothelial cells
were seeded on integrin-adhesive matrices, such as on the
integrin b-1 or b-3 ligand ﬁbronectin or on the speciﬁc integrin
b-3 ligand ﬁbrinogen, p44/p42 MAPK became phosphorylated
upon addition of soluble CEA. In contrast, CEA had no impact
on p44/p42 MAPK phosphorylation in endothelial cells seeded
on poly-D-lysine (PDL), which does not interact with integrins,
but was phosphorylated upon VEGF, indicating that endothelial cells were alive (Fig. 4A). The requirement of engaged
integrins was further proven by speciﬁc blocking antibodies
directed against integrin b-3 (LM609), which diminished CEAinduced p44/p42 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). The direct

involvement of integrin-b subdomains in CEA-initiated signal
transduction was indicated by the CEA-induced enhancement
of activation of critical upstream components of integrin
signaling, such as FAK, and c-src (Fig. 4C and D). Because
addition of the MEK inhibitor U0126 had no effect on CEA-

induced FAK phosphorylation, FAK seems to signal upstream
of p44/42-MAPK (not shown). As a consequence, integrindependent cellular functions such as endothelial cell spreading
were enhanced whenever CEA was present (Fig. 4E). Importantly, integrin expression was unaffected by CEA (not shown).

CEA Affects Angiogenesis

CEA induces integrin activation via inside-out signaling
CEA binding to endothelial cells was shown by immunoprecipitation as well as immunocytochemistry (Fig. 5A and
B). As a consequence, CEAR was phosphorylated (Fig. 5C),
which is consistent with previous observations (32). Integrin
adhesion receptors rapidly increase ligand-binding afﬁnity
(integrin activation) upon intracellular stimuli (inside-out
signaling). Integrin activation is thereby induced by talinbinding to cytoplasmic domains of b-integrins (33). Thus, we
have analyzed talin binding to integrins b-3 tails using cell
lysates from CEA-stimulated or control endothelial cells
using afﬁnity chromatography. We found that talin binding
to integrin b-3 tails was increased upon CEA stimulation
(Fig. 5D), suggesting that CEA leads to integrin activation.
Consistently, addition of CEA exerted enhanced binding of
both WOW-1, a Fab antibody fragment speciﬁcally recognizing active aVb3 integrins (Fig. 5E; ref. 20) and a FITClabeled cyclic RGD peptide, a high-afﬁnity ligand for active
aV integrins (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B). The CEAinduced activated afﬁnity state of integrins was reﬂected
by increased endothelial cell binding to integrin-adhesive
matrix proteins (Fig. 5F). Furthermore, we observed that
CEA-induced endothelial cell proliferation was abolished
by the blocking anti-b3 integrin antibody LM609 when
added after cells were adhered (Fig. 4F). We conclude that
integrin b-3 is involved in CEA-induced endothelial cell
activation.
CEA overexpression is accompanied by enhanced tumor
vascularization
To analyze whether soluble CEA has any biologic impact on
tumor angiogenesis, we next analyzed vascularization in tumor
tissue samples derived from spontaneous developing gastric
tumors in double-transgenic offspring of CEA424-Simian-Virus40T-antigen (CEA424/Tag) mice mated with human CEAtransgenic (CEA424/Tag-CEA) mice and compared results
with vascular densities of spontaneous tumors in nonCEA–expressing CEA424/Tag mice. CEA-expressing tumors
revealed a markedly higher vascular density than controls
(7.04  0.18 blood vessels/unit  SEM for CEA424/Tag-CEA
vs. 3.430.12 in CEA424/Tag; P < 0.001; Fig. 6A). Notably,
tumors of same sizes were compared.
To overcome some disadvantages of spontaneous tumor
models, such as limitation in comparing growth dynamic of
asynchronous onset of tumor growth, we introduced tumor
transplantation assays. We used a stable CEA-overexpressing
sarcoma cell line (Fig. 6B), which was transplanted into BALB/c
mice. When the high CEA-expressing Meth-A (Meth-A/CEA)
sarcomas were compared with the endogenously non-CEA–
expressing wild-type sarcomas (Meth-A/wt), a markedly higher
tumor vascularization was observed whenever CEA was present (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, the sizes of explanted Meth-A/CEA
tumors were signiﬁcantly higher than Meth-A/wt allotransplants. Similar results were obtained in a renal cell cancer
xenotransplant assay using stable overexpressing CEA (Caki2/
CEA) or non-CEA–expressing mock-transfected Caki2 cells
(Caki2/mock), which were injected into nude mice (Supplementary Fig. S2B).

To exclude any indirect effects of CEA on angiogenesis such
as previously reported CEA binding to NK cells via CEACAM1
(22), we next performed tumor transplants in NSG mice, which
are characterized by severe immunodeﬁciency due to the
absence of functional NK cells, absence of mature T and B
cells, and deﬁciency in cytokine signaling (34). As expected,
growth of tumor transplants was enhanced in both groups, but
CEA-expressing tumors (Meth-A/CEA) grew signiﬁcantly faster than Meth-A/wt. Consistently, CEA-expressing tumors
explanted after 8 days revealed a higher vascular density
(Meth-A/wt: 63  27.14 blood vessels/unit; Meth-A/CEA:
13931.47 blood vessels/unit; n ¼ 5 mice per group; P <
0.01) and vessel area (Meth-A/wt: 1.0%  0.23%; Meth-A/CEA:
3.12%  0.54%) compared with Meth-A/wt. After 21 days,
Meth-A/wt-tumors were signiﬁcantly smaller than Meth-A/
CEA transplants (Meth-A/wt: 1.11  0.51 g; Meth-A/CEA: 3.24
 0.67 g; n ¼ 5; P < 0.01) and tumor growth curves still diverged.
Again, CEA-expressing tumors revealed a higher vessel area
and increased blood vessel density, when compared with
controls (Fig. 6C).
These data demonstrate that CEA overexpression is accompanied by higher tumor vascularization.
High CEA expression is a negative prognostic factor for
survival in patients with colorectal cancer (27). Thus, we ﬁnally
analyzed whether CEA expression correlates with tumor
angiogenesis in patients with colorectal cancer. Immunohistochemical analyses of parafﬁn-embedded tumor tissue
sections derived from patients with metastasized colorectal
cancer, who had either normal (5.1 ng/mL) or high (34.9
ng/mL) baseline serum CEA levels, were performed. Thereby, high CEA expression was accompanied by high vascularization of the tumor microenvironment represented by
an increased vessel area and an increased number of blood
vessels, when compared with tissue samples derived from
patients with low preoperative CEA levels (Fig. 6D and
Supplementary Table S1).
Interference with CEA-receptor expression affects tumor
vascularization
Finally, we aimed to interfere with CEA-induced tumor
angiogenesis. In a previous study, CEA was immunologically
targeted via CEA mimotope vaccination, resulting in a significantly reduced growth of CEA-expressing tumor transplants
(Meth-A/CEA; ref. 16). Although in CEA mimotope-vaccinated
mice tumor angiogenesis was markedly reduced (Supplementary Fig. S1), we aimed to exclude potential secondary immunologic effects in CEA mimotope-immunized mice including
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or complementdependent cytotoxicity. Furthermore, targeting integrins is
not an adequate model to study CEA-induced tumor angiogenesis, as integrins represent a central player in angiogenesis
(35). Thus, we interfered with CEAR expression in host endothelial cells in vivo. Notably, Meth-A tumor cells do not express
endogenous CEAR, whereas host endothelial cells express
CEAR, but are deﬁcient in endogenous CEA expression (Supplementary Fig. S5H).
In detail, CEAR expression in mouse endothelial cells was
downregulated via a mouse CEAR-speciﬁc shRNA lentiviral

construct. We found that in low CEAR endothelial cells, p44/
p42 MAPK-phosphorylation upon CEA stimulation was
decreased, thus, suggesting a critical role for CEAR in CEAmediated proangiogenic signaling in endothelial cells (Fig. 7B).
When we interfered mouse CEAR expression in a tumor
(Meth-A) allotransplant model, we found that the higher tumor
vascularization of Meth-A/CEA tumor transplants was
reverted. Concomitant injection of the mouse CEAR-speciﬁc
shRNA lentiviral construct with Meth-A/CEA tumor cells into
nude mice (Meth-A/CEA plus lv) resulted in a signiﬁcant
reduction of tumor vascularization when compared with
Meth-A/CEA tumors with an empty control virus (Meth-A/
CEA; Fig. 7C). The Meth-A/CEA plus lentivirus transplants had
a remarkable reduction of the mean tumor size (16  24 mg)
when compared with control virus–infected Meth-A/CEA
transplants (184  32 mg; Fig. 7C). The lentiviral infection
rate was equal in both groups (75%  5%; Supplementary Fig.
S5D). Similar results were obtained when the shRNA CEAR
lentivirus construct was coinjected to the human Caki2/CEA
tumor transplants (not shown). Although we cannot exclude
any other interaction partners for CEA, targeting CEAR expression reverted the CEA effect on angiogenesis in these tumor
transplant models. Thus, we conclude that CEA/CEAR system
plays a functional role in tumor angiogenesis.

Discussion
For the last decade, targeting the VEGF/VEGFR system was
the only antiangiogenic approach clinically available to interfere with tumor growth and propagation. Although efﬁcient in
certain tumors, such as originating from colon, ovary, kidney,
or brain, not all patients with cancer respond or even become
resistant to this antiangiogenic approach. In this study, we give
ﬁrst evidence that CEA, which is frequently overexpressed and
released by carcinomas, might also affect proangiogenic endothelial cell behavior.
Initially, we were referred to a potential role of CEA in tumor
angiogenesis by a recent immunologic CEA-targeting study
(16). Thereby, CEA-vaccinated mice were found to have a
remarkably lower degree of vascularization in tumors of
CEA-immunized mice, as compared with tumors in control
animals (Supplementary Fig. S1).
To analyze whether CEA directly affected endothelial
cells, endothelial cell behavior was studied in vitro and in
vivo. We observed that endothelial cell adhesion, spreading,
migration, and proliferation were enhanced in the presence
of CEA (Figs. 1A–D, 2G and H, and 4E, G, and H). Notably,
CEA was active at concentrations of 10 ng/mL, which is
higher than CEA serum levels found in healthy individuals
(5 ng/mL), but is frequently exceeded in patients with

certain cancers. In vitro, CEA-induced endothelial cell activation was independent of the VEGF/VEGFR-1/2 system
(Fig. 3A, B, and D), which might suggest that CEA bypass
VEGF-targeting drugs. However, the clinical relevance
remains to be elucidated and is currently analyzed in a
translational approach.
The ﬁnding that CEA-induced endothelial cell activation was
rather induced via integrin b-3 adhesion receptors (Fig. 4B and
F), was consistent with previous ﬁndings that CEA interacts
with integrins (14, 15). We now observed that CEA led to an
increase in integrin ligand-binding activity via enhanced talin/
integrin interaction (Fig. 5D). As a consequence, integrin's most
upstream signaling molecules FAK and c-src became activated
(Fig. 4A–D). Consistently, the function-blocking b-3 integrin
antibody LM609 diminished CEA-induced p44/p42 MAPK
phosphorylation and CEA-induced endothelial cell proliferation. The role of integrins in angiogenesis is well established
and has led to the introduction of interfering agents into
preclinical as well as clinical phase I–III trials (36–38).
Notably, endothelial cells do not express CEA (Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B), but we demonstrated that soluble CEA
interacts with CEAR on endothelial cells (Fig. 5A and B).
Finally, interference with CEAR expression via siRNA or a
shRNA-bearing lentivirus construct led to a marked reduction
of CEA-induced signal transduction in endothelial cells (Fig.
7B) and tumor angiogenesis (Fig. 7C). Further interaction
partners, however, such as the VEGF-interacting proteins
neuropilins (39) or other members of the CEACAM-family
(40), can currently not be excluded. Thus, the transmembrane
signaling molecule CEACAM1 has been shown to affect angiogenesis (41, 42) and in NK cells CEA was described to interact
with CEACAM1 (22). In experimental settings, we also detected
CEACAM1 expression in endothelial cells, but a partial downregulation of CEACAM1 was dispensable for CEA-induced
signaling (Supplementary Fig. S6). This does not exclude a
potential prerequisite of low amounts of CEACAM1 for effective CEA signaling.
To ﬁnally analyze the biologic relevance of CEA on tumor
angiogenesis, we studied a preexisting spontaneous stomach
tumor model, which developed gastric cancers with or without
transgenic human CEA expression. Furthermore, syngenic and
xenogenic tumor transplant models using either sarcoma or
renal cell cancer cell lines consistently suggested CEA as an
effective stimulus in tumor angiogenesis, which was also
observed in NSG mice, which lack NK cell function (Fig.
5D). These data thus suggest that tumor angiogenesis is
enhanced by CEA overexpression in various types of malignancies (Fig. 6D). Although preliminary, immunohistochemical analyses of human colorectal cancer tissue sections
