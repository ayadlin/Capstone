ABSTRACT
How many lives have already been saved by the anti-cancer drug metformin?
Inadvertently perhaps, among the millions of type 2 diabetics with occult or known
cancers and who have been prescribed metformin since the 1950s, thousands may
have benefited from the anticancer properties of this first-line pharmacotherapy.
Quo vadis? Now, researchers aim to move metformin from a non-targeted stage of
cancer therapy that has been mostly developed retrospectively and empirically into
a targeted therapy by following a biological rationale and a predefined mechanism
of action. But, who might benefit from metformin? Cui bono? Because metformin is
on the leading edge of a new generation of cancer metabolism-targeted therapies,
perhaps it is the right time to provide solutions to the challenges that metformin and
other onco-biguanides will face in the coming years before becoming incorporated
into the therapeutic armamentarium against cancer.

How many lives have already been saved by the
anti-cancer drug metformin?
In a highly prevalent disease such as breast cancer
(BC), a moderate improvement in survival rates would
be enough to save thousands of lives worldwide if a
given therapeutic approach is widely available and is
accompanied by a benefit to a significant proportion of
women developing the disease. When considering insulin
as one of the most plausible biological mechanisms
underlying the link between obesity and diabetes and
a significantly increased risk of BC mortality, it is
remarkable that a lowering of insulin by 25% is associated
with a 5% absolute improvement in BC mortality [1].
Given that metformin can reduce fasting insulin levels 1030% in women with early BC [2], one could speculate
that metformin may have saved thousands of lives among
the millions of diabetic women receiving metformin in the
last 60 years. To put these putative numbers into a relevant
scenario, we should acknowledge that a shift in the
treatment paradigm of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment from
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the more traditional 5 years to 10 years after diagnosis of
BC was praised as “life saving” by the mainstream media
when the landmark ATLAS study [3] demonstrated the
cumulative risk of dying of BC between 5 and 14 years
after first diagnosis was 12.2% in the extended treatment
group vs 15% in the standard treatment group, a reduction
in absolute risk of 2.8% (or a reduction in BC mortality of
28 per 1,000 women). If risk of breast (and other) cancer
is significantly increased in the protracted period when
hyperinsulinemia is present before diabetes diagnosis, as
well as the strong association between hyperinsulinemia
and the metabolic syndrome, countless lives might
be saved because more than 25% of the world’s adult
population would benefit from metformin’s ability to
reduce the insulin-related risk of cancer and cancer-related
mortality. However, while cancer researchers and patients
are eagerly awaiting the results of the NCIC Clinical
Trials Group MA.32 study-an ongoing adjuvant trial of
3,640 women with early stage BC examining the effect of
metformin vs placebo on invasive cancer-free survival and

other outcomes with completed surgery and (neo)adjuvant
chemotherapy [4]-there is growing uncertainty regarding
the best models to predict the practical metformin
posology that might be required for clinical activity in
nondiabetic subjects.
On the one hand, numerous translational concerns
have been expressed over the growing list of in vitro
studies that are offently claimed clinically irrelevant
because millimolar concentrations of metformin are
typically required to induce anticancer effects [5-8],
whereas the doses used in the clinical management of
type 2 diabetes are normally in the range of 8-30 µM.
However, the so-called metformin dosing paradox might
not be translationally significant when considering
that a dynamic relationship exists between metformin
efficacy and chronic energy excess [9-12]. Because
glucose availability promotes cancer aggressiveness
while reducing metformin efficacy, maintenance of
glucose homeostasis through energy restriction, exercise,
and other pharmacological modalities is expected
to enhance metformin responsiveness and clinical
outcomes in cancer patients [11]. Alternatively, synthetic
lethality could be exploited to overcome glucose-driven
resistance to metformin by combining metformin with
anti-angiogenesis agents that promote severe glucose
deprivation in certain areas of the tumor [12]. On the other
hand, although an initial report from the MA.32 trial has
shown that, irrespective of the initial degree of insulin
resistance in eligible non-diabetic women, metformin
significantly improves metabolic parameters such as
insulin and glucose at 6 months [4], it is commonly argued
that the magnitude of such changes is small and may not
be sufficient to alleviate the potential mitogenic and antiapoptotic effects of insulin on occult or known cancers
in patients without metabolic dysregulation. Because the
pharmacology of metformin in the cancer setting has been
largely unexplored, a brace of studies recently published
in Cell Metabolism has attempted to shed new light on the
metformin pharmacokinetic (PK) in mice bearing tumors,

and its implications for human therapy [13, 14].
The studies led by Dowling and Chandel recapitulate
earlier findings from our laboratory and others showing
that mice i.p. injected with metformin have considerably
higher plasma levels of metformin than those receiving
the drug dissolved in the drinking water [15, 16] (Table
1). To evaluate the missing PK properties of metformin in
the context of cancer therapy while concurrently excluding
a role for insulin in its anti-tumor action in murine cancer
models, we used breast xenotumors formed by PIK3CA
H1047R-mutated MCF10DCIS.com cells (Cufí et al.,
2013), which proliferate in vitro irrespective of the
presence or absence of insulin, and form tumors that are
refractory to dietary restriction (DR) in vivo [17, 18]. In
a first cohort, cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) mice
had ad libitum access to drinking water with 1.25 mg/
mL metformin, which provided a daily oral dose of ~250
mg/kg. In a second cohort, metformin was administered
to CDX mice by i.p. injection (200 mg/kg, once daily).
The average plasma levels of metformin were evaluated
using HPLC coupled to electrospray ionization quadrupole
time-of-flight mass spectrometry at the end of an 8-week
treatment when animals were sacrificed to evaluate
tumor volume, mitotic activity, and anatomopathological
features. BALB/c nude mice receiving metformin in the
drinking water yielded plasma concentrations in the 5 µM
range, an identical range to that reported by Chandel et
al. [14] in C57NL/6J mice and in J:Nu mice bearing the
metformin-responsive HCT116 p53-/- colon cancer tumor
(Table 1). When metformin was measured 2 h after the last
i.p. dose, metformin peaked in the plasma >100 fold higher
than that found with the oral dosing schedule. Dowling
et al. [13] now similarly report that the average plasma
level of metformin in NOD/SCID mice xenografted with
metformin-unresponsive HCT116 colorectal cancer cells
was drastically higher in the i.p.-treated group (Table 1).
Because the cation metformin is expected to accumulate
up to 500-fold in mitochondria by virtue of the membrane
potential, the low micromolar concentrations of plasma

a

metformin in murine cancer models treated with the
standard oral dosing of diabetic patients might translate
into an anti-tumor activity exclusively attributable to
metformin’s ability to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation
[13]. In our hands, such diabeto-biguanide activity
modestly affected the growth of insulin-independent breast
xenotumors, reaching a maximum of 43% at 4 weeks
after inoculation of tumor cells and decreasing to 30-35%
reduction toward the end of the treatment period [16, 18].
The apparent correlation between longer exposure to i.p.delivered metformin, higher levels of plasma metformin,
and higher efficacy in murine cancer models might
suggests a re-evaluation of metformin administration
regimens to optimize drug plasma levels and delivery to
the tumor, but with the potential of involving mechanisms
of action not strictly related with blockade of oxidative
phosphorylation [14]. In our hands, such onco-biguanide
activity increased in a temporal manner, reaching a highly
significant >80% inhibition of tumor growth [16, 18].
We need to anticipate the challenges that developing
metformin and other onco-biguanides as bona fide anticancer metabolic therapeutics will face in the coming
years (Table 2):
- First, the recent discovery that in vivo environment
strictly dictates the metabolic phenotype of tumors
in patients and mouse models [19] together with the
contradictory findings obtained in patient-derived
xenograft (PDX) models treated with metformin [20,
21], strongly indicate that clinically-translatable models
remain to be developed to accurately assess the true
potential of metformin-based therapeutic modalities. The
use of immunocompromised mice or the fact that the
subcutaneous compartment where tumors are placed in
CDX and PDX is not analogous to the microenvironment
within organs might significantly impact the response to
metformin. Patient-derived orthotopic xenografts (PDOX)
and 3D cancer tissue bioreactors for long-term organotypic
culture and drug delivery might better approximate a
metformin-targetable in vivo tumor microenvironment ex
vivo.
- Second, effective design, analysis, and
interpretation of PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) studies
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

would enable a better understanding of the mechanism
of metformin action and identify PK properties for
further improvement. A valuable route to implement the
successful development of metformin as an anti-cancer
drug might involve PK/PD modeling of metformin in
type 2 diabetics enrolled in early research phases of other
oncology discovery projects involving metformin-related
molecular targets (e.g., inhibitors of mTOR, PI3K) [2224]. Such an approach could help elucidate the relationship
between PK and PD, help to understand the mechanism of
metformin action, and identify PK properties for further
development and optimal usage of metformin in a cancer
setting.
- Third, a major challenge in metformin posology
and/or administration to optimize drug plasma levels
is how to ensure that high metformin concentrations
will cause tumor regression with minimal normal tissue
toxicity. Although it is commonly acknowledged that such
approaches will inevitably suffer from narrow therapeutic
windows that might cause side effects such as lactic
acidosis, we must consider the evidence that a Cochrane
review and an analysis of the UK-based General Practice
Research Database revealed no cases of fatal lactic
acidosis and crude incidence rates of only 3.3 cases per
100,000 person-years among metformin users [25, 26].
Although it could be argued that additional side effects
might be seen at supra-diabetic metformin concentrations,
there have been no attempts to evaluate metformin-based
synthetic lethal interactions sparing normal cells while
selectively killing cancer cells. Hypothesis-driven and
screening-based (e.g., chemical, siRNA/shRNA, CRISPR
libraries) synthetic lethality approaches [27] would
identify second-site molecular targets that could synergize
with metformin-related metabolic targets and improve
metformin efficacy, and might even provide new clinically
relevant biomarkers for patient selection. A hypothesisdriven synthetic lethality approach recently conducted
in our laboratory revealed the extreme vulnerability
of cells deficient in the BC early onset gene BRCA1 to
NAD+ depletion after concurrent metformin [28] and
nicotimamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)
inhibition, suggesting that the evaluation of metformin/
54098

NAMPT small molecule inhibitor combinations (e.g.,
FK866) to treat BRCA1-related BC may be warranted
(manuscript in preparation).
- Fourth, identification of predictive biomarkers
of response to metformin and precise patient selection
is essential to ensure the measurement of true response
rates without bias through inclusion of patients who do not
respond to metformin simply because they are not suitable
candidates to benefit from it. In the vast majority of
ongoing metformin-based clinical trials, patient selection
based on a particular biomarker has not been carried
out, which may have improved the commonly observed
poor response rates. In addition, the dysregulation and
integration of multiple metabolic pathways in most
tumors might trigger redundant/compensatory networks
that could impact the effectiveness of metformin.
Metformin-diagnostic co-development programs should
be implemented to identify “decisive” stratification factors
that have the potential to be an important tool for clinicians
in relation to: 1) the identification of patients who are most
likely to benefit from metformin; 2) the identification of
patients likely to be at increased risk of serious adverse
reactions as a result of metformin treatment; and 3)
monitoring response to metformin to achieve improved
safety or effectiveness. Such companion diagnostic
assays, which should have a high degree of analytical
validity before they can be released for routine clinical
usage, might incorporate multi-metabolite panels based
on the identification of metformin-driven metabolomic/
fluxomic “fingerprints” of specific cellular events related
with efficacy and safety. The exploration of the exometabolome to monitor, in real-time, biomarker/surrogate
endpoints of metformin efficacy in liquid biopsies
including urine [29] might optimize and accelerate the
design of metformin-based personalized cancer therapies.
Inadvertently perhaps, among the millions of type 2
diabetics with occult or known cancers and who have been
prescribed metformin since the 1950s, thousands may
have benefited from the anticancer properties of this firstline pharmacotherapy. Quo vadis? Now, researchers aim
to move metformin from a “non-targeted” stage of cancer
therapy that has been mostly developed retrospectively
and empirically into a “targeted” therapy by following a
biological rationale and a predefined mechanism of action.
But, who might benefit from metformin? Cui bono? If
metformin is on the leading edge of a new generation of
metabolic targeted therapies, perhaps it is the right time
to consider that the challenges facing the incorporation
of metformin into the therapeutic armamentarium against
cancer might be as complicated as targeting genetic
aberrations, if not more so.
