Abstract
Metastasis, the primary cause of death in most forms of
cancer, is a multistep process whereby cells from the primary
tumor spread systemically and colonize distant new sites.
Blocking critical steps in this process could potentially inhibit
tumor metastasis and dramatically improve cancer survival
rates; however, our understanding of metastasis at the
molecular level is still rudimentary. Growth factor receptor
binding protein 2 (Grb2) is a widely expressed adapter protein
with roles in epithelial cell growth and morphogenesis, as
well as angiogenesis, making it a logical target for anticancer
drug development. We have previously shown that a potent
antagonist of Grb2 Src homology-2 domain–binding, C90,
blocks growth factor–driven cell motility in vitro and
angiogenesis in vivo. We now report that C90 inhibits
metastasis in vivo in two aggressive tumor models, without
affecting primary tumor growth rate. These results support
the potential efficacy of this compound in reducing the
metastatic spread of primary solid tumors and establish a
critical role for Grb2 Src homology-2 domain–mediated
interactions in this process. [Cancer Res 2007;67(13):6012–6]

Introduction
Metastasis, clinically the most important process in the
progression of most types of cancer, remains poorly understood
at the molecular level (1, 2). Patients with metastatic disease have
far less favorable survival rates when compared with tumors
discovered and treated while still confined to the primary site of
occurrence. Furthermore, metastasis can insidiously appear many
years after the primary tumor is removed or treated, due to the
presence and growth of undetectable micrometastasis. These facts
underscore the desperate need for therapies specifically targeting
micrometastatic disease. Such agents have the potential to
dramatically improve survival rates for most cancers.
Metastasis is a multistep process (3, 4). Primary tumor cells must
first invade the surrounding tissue through a coordinated process
of matrix remodeling and motility, requiring, among other things,
focal adhesion complex recycling at the leading edge of the
lamellipodia (5). Cells breaching the vasculature reach distant sites
via the systemic circulation, then extravasate, invade new tissue,
and proliferate again. Rational drug development strategies

targeting these cellular events have focused on a variety of
molecules, including critical regulators of extracellular matrix, cell
motility, adhesion, and survival (2). The ability of several growth
factors widely implicated in cancer, such as hepatocyte growth
factor (HGF), to stimulate cell motility, morphogenesis, and cell
cycle progression makes their signaling pathway components
particularly attractive drug targets (6–8).
Growth factor receptor binding protein 2 (Grb2) is a ubiquitously expressed adapter protein that links activated tyrosine
kinases (TK) to the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
pathway via selective recognition of the phosphotyrosyl (pY)
peptide motif pYXNX (where N is asparagine and X is any residue)
by its Src homology-2 (SH2) domain and constitutive binding of
Sos1 by its two SH3 domains (9). Many growth factor receptor TKs,
nonreceptor TKs (e.g., focal adhesion kinase or FAK), intracellular
effectors of these pathways and phosphotyrosine phosphatases,
possess the pYXNX motif recognized by the Grb2 SH2 domain (9).
The unique structural features and phosphopeptide selectivity of
the Grb2 SH2 domain have facilitated the development of small
synthetic binding antagonists that potently disrupt functions
mediated by its interaction with cognate proteins (10). We
previously showed potent blockade of growth factor–stimulated
cell motility, matrix invasion, and morphogenesis in various cell
models, as well as angiogenesis in vivo, by this class of compounds
(11, 12). We now show that a prototype of this compound class,
C90, can inhibit tumor metastasis in two different murine models.
These results support the potential efficacy of these compounds in
reducing the spread of primary solid tumors, and establish a
critical role for Grb2 SH2 domain–mediated interactions in this
process.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and cell culture. The Grb2-SH2 domain–binding antagonist
C90 was prepared as described (11). PC3M-luc-C6 cells (Xenogen Corp.) were
derived from PC3M cells by stable transfection with firefly luciferase and maintained according to the instructions of the manufacturer. B16-F1 murine
melanoma cells stably transfected with luciferase were maintained in DMEM +
10% fetal bovine serum. Recombinant HGF was obtained from R&D Systems.
Cell migration assays. Cell migration was measured using modified
Boyden chambers as described (11). PC3M and B16 cells were seeded at
200,000 and 150,000 cells per chamber, respectively. B16 cell migration
was stimulated with serum (10%) and membrane bottoms were coated
with fibronectin (10 Ag/mL). Mean values from four fields (1  1.4 mm)
were calculated for each of triplicate wells per condition. IC50 values were
determined using GraphPad Prism software.
Cell proliferation assays. Cell proliferation was determined by 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. PC3M
or B16 cells (25  103) were incubated in 96-well plates for 24 h before
serum deprivation and treatment with the indicated concentrations of C90,
in the presence and absence of HGF (PC3M) or serum (B16) for 36 h. An
MTT solution (1 mg/mL; Sigma) was added and plates were incubated at

37jC for 3 h before measuring absorbance at 562 nm (Bio-TEK
instruments).
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. c-Met/Grb2 interaction was analyzed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting as
described (11). FAK-Grb2 interaction was analyzed similarly, using different
anti-FAK antibodies for immunoprecipitation (Upstate) and immunoblotting (BD Biosciences), and anti-Grb2 for immunoblotting (Santa Cruz
Biotech). Antibodies for phospho- and total Akt and MAPK immunoblotting
were from Cell Signaling and were used as described (13).
Immunofluorescence photomicroscopy. Cells plated in chamber slides
were serum-deprived in the presence or absence of C90 (1 Amol/L) for 24 h,
stimulated with HGF (50 ng/mL) for 1 h, then fixed and permeabilized.
Slides were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h,
incubated with anti-FAK antibodies (BD Biosciences) overnight at 4jC,
washed, then incubated with Texas red–labeled secondary antibody
(Molecular Probes) and Alexa488-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes)
for 1 h. Slides were washed with PBS, nuclei were stained with 4’,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Molecular Probes), and epifluorescence
images were digitally acquired using an Olympus photomicroscope and
IPLab software (Scanalytics).
Tumor xenograft models. Cells were treated ex vivo for 16 h with C90
(1 Amol/L), harvested, washed in PBS, and resuspended at the appropriate
cell density for injection in the presence of C90 (10 Amol/L). Cells were
delivered hypodermically into the dorsal tail vein (B16-luc, 2  106 cells)
or s.c. into the flank (PC3M-luc, 3  106 cells; B16-luc, 1  106 cells) of
12-week-old male SCID/Beige mice (Taconic, Inc.). Primary tumor volume
was calculated by caliper measurements based on the formula (length 
length  width) / 6 and tumor mass was measured on a microbalance.
On the indicated days, mice were injected with D-luciferin (150 mg/kg;

Xenogen) and imaged (IVIS Imaging System 100 Series; Xenogen) for 1 or
5 min. Total body bioluminescence was quantified by integrating the
photonic flux (photons per second) through a uniform region of interest. All
animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the NIH Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Results, expressed as mean
F SD, were compared by Student’s t test.

Results and Discussion
C90 blocks Grb2/c-Met and Grb2/FAK interactions in intact
cells. Serum-deprived PC3M cells were treated with C90 for
16 h prior to brief stimulation with HGF and coimmunoprecipitation analysis of Grb2/cMet interaction (Fig. 1A). Consistent with
prior studies, Grb2/c-Met binding was strictly ligand-dependent
(11). Treatment with C90 completely disrupted c-Met/Grb2
interaction in PC3M cells at concentrations as low as 30 nmol/L
(Fig. 1A). The selectivity of C90 for the SH2 domain of Grb2 was
investigated in the same cells by analyzing HGF-stimulated
activation of Akt and MAPK downstream of c-Met (Fig. 1B).
Disruption of ligand-stimulated interaction between c-Met and the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) SH2 domain, the latter being
structurally distinct from the SH2 domain of Grb2, would be
expected to block PI3K-dependent activation of Akt (14). Yet, Akt
activation was completely unaffected by C90 treatment, even at a
dose 10-fold higher than that sufficient to disrupt c-Met/Grb2
binding (Fig. 1B, top). Similarly, pathways to MAPK activation other
than via Grb2-mediated recruitment of Sos1/Ras persist in the

Grb2 SH2 domain–mediated interactions. Oncogenically relevant
Grb2 SH2 domain–mediated interactions with proteins other than
c-Met were also blocked by C90 treatment (Fig. 1C). Immunopre-

staining with anti-FAK antibodies (Fig. 1D). These results indicate a
critical role for Grb2 in focal adhesion formation, in addition to its
other known roles in mediating HGF-stimulated cell motility.
C90 inhibits metastatic tumor cell migration in vitro. The
Grb2 SH2 domain–binding antagonism was associated with
diminished HGF-stimulated migration in both metastatic cell lines
in vitro (Fig. 2). C90 significantly inhibited PC3M cell migration
over a range of concentrations with an IC50 of 150 nmol/L (Fig. 2A;
R 2 = 0.98, P < 0.0003). Consistent with prior studies (11) and with
persistent PI3K and MAPK signaling, C90 had no significant effect
on PC3M cell proliferation over the same dose range (Fig. 2B).
C90 treatment also resulted in significant, dose-dependent
inhibition of serum-stimulated B16 cell migration (Fig. 2C; IC50 =
650 nmol/L, R 2 = 0.89, P < 0.01). As anticipated, no significant effect
on B16 cell proliferation was associated with C90 treatment over
this dose range (Fig. 2D).
C90 inhibits tumor metastasis in mice. To minimize the
amount of drug needed for these studies, cells were treated ex vivo
before being introduced into the animals. PC3M human prostate
adenocarcinoma cells were stably transfected with luciferase
(PC3M-luc-C6) to enable bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and were
treated for 16 h with 1 Amol/L of C90 prior to s.c. injection into the
flanks of SCID/beige mice (six per group). With primary PC3M
tumor growth over 3 weeks, cells spontaneously metastasize to the
lungs (15). Within 1 week, the intense BLI signal of the primary
tumors obscured the signal generated by lung metastases (data not
shown); for this reason, at day 20 postinjection, animals were
injected with luciferin immediately before sacrifice and lungs were
removed for imaging ex vivo. As shown in Fig. 3A, the mean
bioluminescent intensity from the lungs of mice receiving C90treated cells was significantly (f50%) lower than control levels

(P < 0.05). As anticipated, analysis of the PC3M primary tumors
revealed no differences in mass or volume between C90-treated
and control groups (Fig. 3B), confirming the absence of any
cytoreductive or cytotoxic effects of this compound.
B16 cell cultures stably transfected with luciferase (B16-luc) for
in vivo BLI were similarly treated for 16 h with 1 Amol/L of C90
prior to harvest and resuspension for tail vein injection (six mice
per group). As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1A, SCID/Beige mice
injected with untreated cells displayed an intense bioluminescence
signal corresponding to a consistent and remarkable number of
lesions in the lungs after 1 week, whereas the bioluminescence
signal from lungs of animals receiving C90-treated B16-luc cells
was significantly lower (P V 0.05). Animals were then sacrificed and
lung bioluminescence was determined ex vivo as for PC3M with
similar (f50%) signal inhibition associated with C90 pretreatment
(Fig. 3C). To exclude the possibility that C90 treatment affected
tumor cell viability, identically prepared cells were injected s.c. in
the flanks of SCID/Beige mice and tumor growth rate (Supplementary Fig. S1B) as well as final tumor mass and volume were
measured (Fig. 3D). Consistent with cell proliferation studies, no
differences were noted in the growth of primary B16 tumors
derived from control or C90-treated cells.
Consistent with BLI analyses, lungs from the B16 melanoma
control animal group, as observed macroscopically, displayed a
dramatic and devastating number of pigmented lesions relative to
lungs removed from the C90-treated animal group or lungs from
normal animals not receiving tumor cells (Fig. 4A). Histopathologic
analysis confirmed the presence of numerous large metastatic
lesions in the lungs of animals receiving untreated B16 cells and far
fewer, significantly smaller, lesions in the lungs of animals receiving
C90-treated cells (Fig. 4B and C). Histopathologic analysis of lungs

from animals receiving PC3M cells confirmed the presence of
spontaneous metastatic lesions, with striking differences in both
size and number between control and C90-treated groups (Fig. 4D).
The significant inhibition of metastasis observed in these models
is consistent with the potent effects of this class of compounds on
cell motility, invasion, and associated cellular processes. Seeking
a proxy for Grb2 SH2 domain–binding antagonism in vivo,
expression microarray studies on control and drug-treated cell
cultures were done to identify drug-responsive genes. Among
several genes, the expressions of which were significantly
modulated by drug treatment (data not shown), N-cadherin was
selected for further study because of its well-documented
importance in tumor invasiveness (16, 17). Array results were first
confirmed by real-time PCR (Supplementary Fig. S2A). N-cadherin
mRNA transcripts levels in PC3M cell cultures that had been
treated with C90 for 3 days were consistently suppressed by f50%
relative to untreated cells (P < 0.0001). Analysis of primary PC3M
tumor samples obtained 10 days postimplantation, after measurable solid tumors had formed in all animals, revealed that
N-cadherin expression was suppressed by >50% in tumors derived
from C90-treated cells relative to untreated controls (Supplementary Fig. S2B; P < 0.0001). These results provide evidence of a
biologically relevant drug effect in tumor tissue in vivo and reveal
that Grb2 SH2 domain–mediated signaling promotes increased
N-cadherin expression in aggressively malignant cells.
Conclusions. We report that treatment of tumor cells with the
Grb2 SH2 domain antagonist C90 substantially reduced the
metastatic burden to lungs detected in mice 1 week (B16) or

3 weeks (PC3M) after injection. Several lines of evidence suggest
that the primary mode of drug action is the disruption of cell
motility and invasiveness; no significant effects on tumor cell
viability or proliferation rate were observed in vitro or in vivo. The
ability of C90 administered to cells prior to their implantation in
animals to significantly inhibit tumor spread suggests that it acts
early in the metastatic process, consistent with a model in which a
small, metastatically competent fraction of the tumor cell
population invade and colonize distant sites soon after their
introduction into the host (18).
Further work will be needed to optimize drug delivery and
dosing; nonetheless, the observed activity of this class of
compounds in vivo in two aggressive tumor models strongly
supports their potential efficacy as antimetastatic drugs. Our
studies also reveal that whereas Grb2 signaling is suspected of
contributing to tumor progression and malignancy by promoting
cell proliferation as well as adhesion and motility, only the latter are
susceptible to blockade through SH2 domain antagonism alone.
Combining Grb2 SH2 domain antagonists with agents that target
cell cycle progression or survival may lead to the development of
effective and comprehensive anticancer therapies.
