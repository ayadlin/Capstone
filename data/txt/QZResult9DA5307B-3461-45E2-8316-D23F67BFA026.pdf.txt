BACKGROUND: Preoperative chemotherapy improves the outcome in patients with colorectal cancer with liver metastases. In the
current study, the authors evaluated the activity of a conversion treatment with the combination of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin
(XELOX) used in association with panitumumab in patients with unresectable, liver-only, metastatic colon cancer. METHODS: Chemotherapy-naive patients with unresectable liver metastases from colon cancer with no other metastatic disease sites were enrolled. All
patients received upfront therapy with XELOX plus panitumumab (P-XELOX) and were reevaluated for resectability every 4 cycles.
The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, the percentage of patients whose disease became radically resectable, and the safety of the P-XELOX combination. RESULTS:
A total of 49 patients were recruited, 35 of whom had wild-type KRAS (wtKRAS) and 14 of whom (who were enrolled before study
amendment) had unknown (9 patients) or mutated (5 patients) KRAS mutational status. Forty-six patients were evaluable for
response. After conversion P-XELOX therapy, the ORR in the general population was 54%, with 2 complete responses, 23 partial
responses, and 14 cases of stable disease. In patients with wtKRAS, the ORR of the patients reached 65% (2 CRs and 19 PRs), which
allowed 15 patients with initial unresectable liver metastasis to be reclassified as having resectable disease. Survival analysis demonstrated a median progression-free survival of 8.5 months and a median OS of 21.9 months. Patients who underwent surgery were
found to have a significantly better OS when compared with those who did not undergo surgery (P <.001). Overall, toxicities were
found to be predictable and manageable, with the most common being cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and neurologic toxicities.
CONCLUSIONS: Conversion P-XELOX therapy yields high response and resectability rates for patients with metastatic colon cancer

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide, with up to 1 million new cases diagnosed each
year.1 The standard treatment for metastatic disease involves chemotherapy based on fluoropyrimidines, oxaliplatin, and
irinotecan (used in combination and sequentially), and monoclonal antibodies targeting vascular endothelial growth factor and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).2-7
In selected patients, surgery can be included in the treatment plan for metastatic CRC (mCRC ); in particular, the
resection of hepatic metastases improves progression-free survival (PFS) and offers the chance for cure in approximately
10% to 20% of patients.8,9 In patients with extensive metastatic involvement of the liver, neoadjuvant chemotherapy can
result in tumor downsizing and lead to the reclassification of a percentage of patients considered to be unresectable to

resectable. However, the classification of liver metastases
into clearly resectable, potentially resectable, or definitely
unresectable is influenced by several variables, such as surgeon experience and innovative radiological and surgical
techniques. Therefore, the criteria for defining resectability often differ in clinical studies and, as a consequence,
the percentage of inoperable patients who undergo radical
resection after frontline chemotherapy varies between
13% and 40%.10-12 The optimization of the preoperative
regimens is critical to the success of the curative strategy.
In fact, a strong relationship between objective tumor
response rate (ORR) and resection rates has been documented in patients with mCRC.13
A previous report has demonstrated that for patients
with liver metastases who are refractory to conventional
chemotherapy, combination therapy with cetuximab(Erbitux; ImClone LLC a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eli
Lilly and Company, Branchburg, NJ) increases resectability rates.14 In a phase 2 trial of cetuximab in combination
with 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin as the first-line treatment of patients with mCRC, an ORR of 79% was
reportedly obtained.15
Panitumumab (Vectibix; Amgen-Dompe, Milan,
Italy) is a fully human antibody that binds to EGFR and
prevents receptor dimerization, tyrosine autophosphorylation of EGFR, and the activation of downstream signaling molecules.16 To our knowledge, the impact of
panitumumab as a part of a conversion therapy in the
metastatic setting has not been investigated to date.
We conducted this prospective, phase 2, multicenter study to investigate the activity, in terms of ORRs
and conversion to resectable status, of the combination
of panitumumab and capecitabine plus oxaliplatin
(XELOX) chemotherapy (P-XELOX) in patients with colon cancer (CC) and synchronous unresectable liver
metastases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligible patients had histologically confirmed metastatic,
unresectable CC with liver involvement with or without
involved perivisceral lymph nodes. Only patients with
synchronous metastatic disease were enrolled to minimize
the impact of previous adjuvant chemotherapy and to
ensure a more homogenous population. Subjects with rectal cancer diagnosed within 12 cm from the anal verge
were excluded because of the different therapeutic
approach that is required in these cases.
Since November 2008, after it was discovered that
wild-type KRAS (wtKRAS) was required for the clinical
activity of panitumumab in patients with metastatic CC
3430

(mCC),17 only patients bearing wtKRAS on codon 12
and 13 of exon 1 were included in the current study.
Liver metastases were considered unresectable in
the simultaneous presence of multiple and bilateral
lesions, with < 50% of the remnant healthy liver, specifically defined as > 3 liver metastases with > 50% hepatic involvement and requiring a major hepatectomy
with contralateral wedge resection. In addition, any
metastasis requiring resection that did not preserve at
least 2 contiguous hepatic segments or adequate vascular inflow and outflow as well as biliary drainage was
considered unresectable.
Other inclusion criteria were a minimum age of 18
years and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status (PS) of  2. In addition,
adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function were
required.
Patients with extrahepatic metastasis, other than that
of regional lymph nodes, were excluded.
The protocol was approved by the Institutional
Review Boards at each participating institution and the
study was performed in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed
consent.
Treatment and Assessment

All patients received panitumumab administered by
intravenous infusion at a dose of 9 mg=kg once every
3 weeks, in combination with oxaliplatin at a dose of
130 mg=m2 on day 1 and capecitabine at a dose of
1000 mg=m2 twice daily from days 1 to 14. Dose reductions or delays for both panitumumab and chemotherapy
were provided in cases of toxicity according to the study
protocol.
After 4 cycles of chemotherapy, patients were evaluated for tumor response. Those who experienced stable
disease (SD) or a partial response (PR) but were still considered unresectable after the first course of therapy
received a second course of treatment (4 cycles) and a surgical reevaluation. In the case of a complete response
(CR), patients continued chemotherapy for 8 cycles.
Patients who were considered eligible for surgery after treatment proceeded to undergo curative metastasectomy and received 4 additional postoperative cycles of
P-XELOX chemotherapy.
Tumor response was assessed using modified
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST). At baseline, computed tomography scans of
the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, along with appropriate
imaging of all other disease sites, were evaluated.

Safety was assessed on the basis of reports of adverse
events, laboratory test results, and vital sign measurements. Toxicities were graded using version 3.0 of the
National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria
(NCI-CTC), with the exception of skin-related or nailrelated toxicities, which were graded using NCI-CTC version 3.0 with modifications.
Statistical Analysis

This phase 2 trial was designed using a Fleming singlestage design to assess the ORR. The null hypothesis is that
the ORR is  25%. The alternative hypothesis is that the
ORR is  45%. Requiring a 90% power against the alternative hypothesis and using a 5% significance level, the
‘Hearn method indicates that 54 patients with wtKRAS
are required.18 Thus, patients with wtKRAS tumors who
were enrolled before the approval of the amended protocol version 3 of 30 (November 2008) were considered
part of the sample.
Efficacy analyses were performed according to the
intent-to-treat principle.
Both PFS and overall survival (OS) were estimated
using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics

From November 2007 to January 2011, 49 patients were
enrolled in 6 different centers in Italy. The baseline characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table 1. Data
collection was censored in August 2011.
Since November 2008, the protocol has been
amended and wtKRAS included as a selection criterion.

ble, for patients who had been included in the study
before the protocol amendment. In 9 cases, the KRAS
mutational status was unknown. Of the remaining
patients, 35 were classified as having wtKRAS mutational
status and 5 patients who were enrolled before the protocol amendment were classified as having mutated KRAS.
The median age of the patients was 60 years (range, 37
years-76 years). All patients had a good PS defined as
ECOG 0 (34 patients) or ECOG 1 (15 patients); no
patients with ECOG 2 were enrolled, although this was
permitted by inclusion criteria. In 28 cases, patients had
undergone colon surgery before study enrollment.
The median follow-up was 16.6 months (range, 1.1
months-38.9 months).
All patients received at least 1 cycle of P-XELOX,
with a median of 6.3 cycles (range, 1 cycle-12 cycles).
Efficacy

The primary endpoint of the current study was ORR. All
data were analyzed separately for the entire study population and for those patients who had wtKRAS disease. The
results are shown in Table 2. Tumor response was assessed
in 46 patients (32 with wtKRAS mutational status) as the
best response achieved during the treatment plan, excluding responses achieved with surgery. An ORR was
recorded in 54% of patients with 2 CRs and 23 PRs.
Fourteen patients (30.4%) achieved SD and 7 (15.2%)
developed progressive disease.
As expected, the results from patients with wtKRAS
demonstrated a better outcome. The overall disease control rate for patients with wtKRAS mutational status was
87.5%, with 2 CRs, 19 PRs, and 7 cases of SD.
Fifteen patients, all of whom had wtKRAS tumors,
underwent surgical resection of their liver metastasis: 10
patients after the first radiological assessment and 5
patients after the second. In 11 cases, a major hepatectomy, defined as a resection of  3 Couinaud segments,
was performed. Ten patients received a median of 3.5
postoperative treatment cycles (range, 1 cycle-4 cycles).

Among the patients who underwent surgery, R0 resection,
defined as radical resection with histologically negative
margins, was achieved in 10 of 15 patients. Colon surgery
was performed at the same time as liver resection, if it had
not been performed previously. No surgery-related deaths
were recorded, nor were any second surgeries required due
to complications. Details regarding the type of resection,
number of perioperative chemotherapy cycles, and outcomes are shown in Table 3.
In the absence of radiologically visible disease, 2
patients with a radiological CR to chemotherapy did not
proceed to liver resection.
Patients were evaluated for survival analysis; the median PFS in the entire population was 8.4 months (95%
confidence interval, 6.8 months-9.9 months) and the median OS was 21.9 months (95% confidence interval, 13.3
months-30.6 months) (Fig. 1 Top and Bottom).
Patients who had undergone surgery for liver metastasis had a better survival outcome when compared with
those who were treated only with palliative chemotherapy;
the median PFS was 14.7 months for patients undergoing
surgery and 7.3 months for unresected patients
(P 5 .079). The median OS was not reached for resected
patients and was 17.1 months for unresected patients
(P < .001) (Fig. 2 Top and Bottom).
As expected, a survival benefit was noted for the
wtKRAS subgroup when compared with those whose
KRAS status was unknown or mutated (P < .001) (Fig. 3).
Safety

Adverse events that were noted are listed in Table 4. The
most common toxicities reported were gastrointestinal,
3432

constitutional, cutaneous, and neurological. In particular,
25 patients experienced diarrhea, which reached grade 3
or higher in 10 cases. Nausea, vomiting, mucositis, and
anorexia were reported in 23 patients, 7 patients, 8
patients, and 6 patients, respectively, but were generally of
grade 1 to 2. Skin toxicity, mostly related to panitumumab, was commonly reported, occurring in up to 90% of
patients; other forms of cutaneous toxicity that are typical
of anti-EGFR agents were observed, in particular folliculitis (11 patients), pruritus (3 patients), conjunctivitis (5
patients), and ungual toxicity (3 patients).
The overall incidence of oxaliplatin-specific neuropathy was relevant (present in 30 patients), but was only
reported as being serious (grade 3 or 4) in 3 patients. It is
interesting to note that 7 patients had allergic reactions to
oxaliplatin that required treatment interruption in 4 cases.
Overall, hematological toxicity was a minor event,
with 6 cases of mild (grade 1 or 2) neutropenia and thrombocytopenia noted. No febrile neutropenia was reported.
All toxicities were managed with dose reduction or
treatment interruption according to the study protocol.
Twenty-one patients required dose reductions for panitumumab, and 22 patients for capecitabine and oxaliplatin.
Nearly 50% of patients received < 8 cycles of chemotherapy; 8 patients developed progressive disease before
the second radiological reevaluation. Treatment interruption was due to adverse events in 7 patients or related to
surgical procedures in 6 patients (inadequate recovery,
timing of surgery, and investigator choice).
Other causes of treatment discontinuation were consent withdrawal, medical decision, and death unrelated to
disease progression or treatment.

DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, the MetaPan study is, the
first study of frontline treatment with the combination of
a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and panitumumab as
neoadjuvant treatment in patients with liver-only, unresectable, synchronous mCC.
The role of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies in
the induction of tumor shrinkage has become more
defined, and currently this frontline treatment should
preferably be performed in patients who might have a

high ORR is obtained using a treatment combining cetuximab with chemotherapy.19-21 In particular, in the phase
2 randomized study of cetuximab plus FOLFOX or cetuximab plus FOLFIRI in the neoadjuvant treatment of nonresectable colorectal liver metastases (CELIM study), the
ORRs were 68% and 57%, respectively, leading to a rate
of R0 resection of 38%, and 30%, respectively, in patients
with unresectable liver metastases.19

Toxicities were graded using version 3 of the National Cancer Institute’s
Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC), with the exception of skin-related or
nail-related toxicities, which were graded using NCI-CTC version 3.0 with
modifications.

A phase 3 randomized study demonstrated that panitumumab, in combination with FOLFOX4, improves
the median PFS when compared with treatment with
FOLFOX4 alone (9.6 months vs 8.0 months; P 5 .02) in
previously untreated patients with mCRC.22 In addition,
a survival advantage was observed in association with
FOLFIRI as a second-line treatment or used alone in
patients with chemotherapy-refractory mCRC.23,24
3434

It is difficult to compare our clinical results with
those of other studies, mainly because of the different definitions of resectability. In fact, other studies12,20,25 have
considered the cutoff point of 5 liver metastases as the
limit for defining resectability. However, the presence of
large, multiple, or bilateral metastases is no longer considered an absolute contraindication to surgery, provided
that radical resection is deemed possible. In the current
study, a very strict definition of unresectable liver metastases was adopted to consider all enrolled patients as
unequivocally excluded from upfront surgery. No upper
limits to metastatic involvement were defined. Thus the
population of patients with mCC enrolled in the current
study included both patients potentially amenable to surgery once downsizing was obtained and those patients
with unresectable disease independent of the degree of tumor shrinkage.
Consequently, it is not surprising that, unlike other
studies of preoperative therapy, the rate of disease progression in the current study was 15%, and that in some cases
a clinical progression anticipated the time of the first radiological evaluation. However, the P-XELOX combination resulted in a high ORR (54.3%) and an impressive
rate of conversion from unresectable to resectable disease
(30.6%). With regard to survival analysis, the results of
21.9 months for OS and 8.4 months for PFS are satisfactory if we consider the baseline characteristics of these
patients. All patients had synchronous CC with major
liver involvement, and were usually characterized as having a very poor prognosis.8
In patients who underwent surgery, the comparison
between OS and PFS allowed us to support the use of surgery whenever feasible. Disease recurrence occurs after the
first surgery in the majority of patients; however, these
patients will most likely benefit from additional surgery or
second-line chemotherapy.26 This may explain why there
was a statistically significant difference in the current
study with regard to OS but not PFS between patients
who did and those who did not undergo surgery.
Results according to KRAS mutational status appear
to be clinically relevant. In the wtKRAS population, the
ORR reached 65%, with a disease control rate of 87.5%
and a conversion rate of 42.8%. However, given that this
type of study did not include a comparison group, this observation suffers from selection biases, as do other noncomparative studies.
The small size of the population is a limiting factor
of the current study. When it was designed, the role of
KRAS mutational status as a predictive factor of response
to anti-EGFR agents had not been clearly defined, and

therefore was not required for enrollment. After the discovery that wtKRAS status is required for the determination of panitumumab activity in patients with mCRC,17
an amendment to the study protocol was made, adding
wtKRAS status as an inclusion criterion. This had significant consequences on patient accrual: the time needed to
determine the KRAS mutational status occasionally conflicted with the urgent need for treatment among some
patients. For this reason, the accrual proceeded slowly and
the preplanned number of subjects was not reached.
With regard to safety, no unexpected toxicities were
recorded and the treatment was globally manageable with
dose reductions. Although toxicity can never be underestimated, in patients with exclusive metastatic liver involvement in whom surgery may play a critical role, the results
in terms of ORR justify the use of an aggressive upfront
treatment.
The P-XELOX combination has proven to be a promising frontline treatment in patients with extensive liver
involvement from CC and deserves further investigation.
