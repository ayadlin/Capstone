Abstract
Epigenetic changes in pediatric neuroblastoma may contribute to the aggressive pathophysiology of this
disease, but little is known about the basis for such changes. In this study, we examined a role for the DNA
methyltransferase DNMT3B, in particular, the truncated isoform DNMT3B7, which is generated frequently in
cancer. To investigate if aberrant DNMT3B transcripts alter DNA methylation, gene expression, and phenotypic
character in neuroblastoma, we measured DNMT3B expression in primary tumors. Higher levels of DNMT3B7
were detected in differentiated ganglioneuroblastomas compared to undifferentiated neuroblastomas, suggesting that expression of DNMT3B7 may induce a less aggressive clinical phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we
investigated the effects of enforced DNMT3B7 expression in neuroblastoma cells, ﬁnding a signiﬁcant inhibition of
cell proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo. DNMT3B7-positive cells had higher levels of
total genomic methylation and a dramatic decrease in expression of the FOS and JUN family members that
comprise AP1 transcription factors. Consistent with an established antagonistic relationship between AP1
expression and retinoic acid receptor activity, increased differentiation was seen in the DNMT3B7-expressing
neuroblastoma cells following treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) compared to controls. Our results
indicate that DNMT3B7 modiﬁes the epigenome in neuroblastoma cells to induce changes in gene expression,
inhibit tumor growth, and increase sensitivity to ATRA. Cancer Res; 72(18); 4714–23. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
In adult cancers, epigenetic changes and aberrant splicing of
DNMT3B are observed frequently (1, 2). Pediatric neuroblastoma is characterized by a range of clinical behaviors, and
genetic and epigenetic aberrations contribute to pathogenesis
(3–5). The Cohn laboratory and others have shown that

hypermethylation and silencing of genes involved in the regulation of tumor growth, cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair
are associated with aggressive growth and poor outcome in
patients (6–8). Further, poor prognosis can be predicted by a
CpG island methylator phenotype (9). Preclinical studies have
demonstrated that neuroblastoma growth can be inhibited by
drugs that disrupt DNA methylation (10, 11). Retinoic acid, a
differentiation-inducing agent that has been shown to improve
clinical outcome (12), can reverse the methylation status of
hundreds of gene promoters (13), possibly due to decreased
levels of the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes (14).
Three DNMT enzymes regulate DNA methylation in eukaryotic cells (15–17), with widespread aberrant DNMT3B transcription in cancer cells, some encoding truncated proteins
lacking the catalytic domain (1, 2, 18–20). Forced expression of
DNMT3B7 within 293 cells led to altered DNA methylation
levels and corresponding gene expression changes, indicating
that DNMT3B7 expression could alter DNA methylation levels
and gene expression (18). DNMT3B7 transgenic mice exhibit
altered embryonic development (21).
Despite advances in genome-wide proﬁling that demonstrate strong correlations between genetic aberrations and
clinical phenotype, we know much less about the clinical
signiﬁcance of epigenetic changes in neuroblastoma. Given
that aberrant DNMT3B isoforms are common in cancer cells,

DNMT3B7 Suppresses Neuroblastoma Growth

we hypothesized that aberrant DNMT3B transcripts found in
neuroblastoma tumors could alter DNA methylation, gene
expression, and tumor phenotype.

Materials and Methods
Patients and tumor specimens
Two ganglioneuroblastoma, three ganglioneuroma, and
fourteen primary neuroblastoma tumors were obtained from
Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago under an IRB
approved protocol. Twelve RNA samples derived from one
ganglioneuroblastoma and eleven neuroblastomas were
obtained from the Children's Oncology Group (COG) Neuroblastoma Tumor Bank. The laboratory studies were approved
by The University of Chicago Institutional Review Board.
Cell culture, cell identiﬁcation, and nucleic acid isolation
Cell line identities were veriﬁed by short tandem repeat
proﬁling using the AmpF/STR Identiﬁler PCR Ampliﬁcation
Kit (Applied Biosystems). RNA and DNA isolation was performed using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and Puregene Core Kit
(Qiagen), respectively.
The MSCV-I-GFP plasmid backbone was engineered to
confer constitutive DNMT3B7 expression using a 50 EcoRI site,
C-terminal His-tag epitope, and 30 XhoI site using primers
listed in Supplementary Table S1. Retroviral constructs and
packaging plasmid psi-Eco were used to produce retroviral
supernatants by 293T cell cotransfection using Fugene6 Transfection Reagent (Roche).
The inducible DNMT3B7 construct was generated using
oligonucleotides listed in Supplementary Table S1 to ligate
into the pRetroX-Tight-Pur response vector (pRXTPL, Clontech Laboratories). The Tet-Off System (Clontech) was used to
produce inducible LA1-55n cell lines. In the presence of doxycycline, there is no induction of gene expression in either the
control or DNMT3B7-containing cell line. In the absence of
doxycycline, the DNMT3B7-containing cells express both GFP
and DNMT3B7, and the vector control cells express only GFP.
We have compared the vector cells expressing GFP to the
experimental cells expressing GFP and DNMT3B7 to control
for any effects of GFP expression.
All plasmid inserts were sequenced to ensure proper correct
sequence.
Neuroblastoma xenograft studies
Four- to six-week-old female homozygous athymic nude
mice (Harlan) were inoculated subcutaneously into the
right ﬂank with DNMT3B7-expressing cells (or control) and
measured twice weekly (see Supplementary Materials
and Methods for details). Tumor volumes were calculated
using the following formula: tumor volume ¼ (length 
width2)/2. Mice bearing SMS-KCNR (constitutive expression) xenografts were sacriﬁced after 28 days. Mice bearing
LA1-55n (inducible expression) xenografts were divided
randomly into two groups when palpable tumors developed;
control mice continued receiving doxycycline-containing
water to block DNMT3B7 expression, and animals in the
experimental group were given normal drinking water

www.aacrjournals.org

to induce DNMT3B7 expression. Mice in both groups were
sacriﬁced after 35 days.
Immunohistochemical analysis
Immunohistochemistry was performed for CD-31 (1:100, M20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to determine the mean vascular
density, and Ki-67 (1:200, MIB-1, DakoCytomation) to assess
proliferation rate (10).
Quantiﬁcation of apoptosis
In situ detection of apoptosis was performed using the In Situ
Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche Diagnostics Corp.; ref. 22).
Liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy
Total cytosine methylation was performed by liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC/MS), as described previously (21).
Sodium bisulﬁte treatment, PCR ampliﬁcation, and
protein expression analysis
Genomic DNA was treated with sodium bisulﬁte (23), and
PCR ampliﬁcations were performed using the primers listed in
Supplementary Table S1 using ZymoTaq (ZymoResearch) at
the indicated temperatures. Reverse transcription was performed using Superscript III (Invitrogen), and PCR ampliﬁcations were performed using Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) using
primers listed in Supplementary Table S1. Whole cell extracts
were made by lysing cells in 75 mmol/L NaCl, 25 mmol/L TrisCl, and 1:100 protease inhibitors (CalBiochem). DNMT3B was
detected with T-16 antibody (1:500, sc-10236, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), and TOP1 was used as a loading control
(1:400, ab3825, AbCam).
RNA-Sequencing
Total RNAs were isolated using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen).
RNA integrity was validated using the Agilent BioAnalyzer, and
all samples had RNA integrity number >9. Libraries were
generated following the Illumina protocol for Preparing Samples for Sequencing of mRNA. PCR ampliﬁed cDNA libraries
were quantiﬁed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Single-end
sequencing was performed for 36 cycles using Single Read
Cluster Generation Kit V4 (Cat# GD-103-4001) and Sequencing
Kits (Cat# FC-104-4002). Sequence reads from the RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) were aligned to genomic sequence (Human
Feb. 2009 assembly, GRCh37/hg19). RNA-Seq data have been
submitted to the GEO database, record number GSE36350.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analysis was performed using a 2-tailed Student's t test or Fisher' Exact Test. A P value  0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant. For the RNA-Seq data,
each DNMT3B7-expressing cell line was compared to the
vector control and Bonferroni correction was used to correct for multiple testing using n ¼ 18,674, the total number of
genes that had at least one read in all 3-cell lines. Analysis
of ATRA treatment of DNMT3B7-expressing or control cells
was done using the mixed effect restricted maximum likelihood analysis model.

Forced expression of DNMT3B7 in neuroblastoma cells
inhibits growth
Because we detected high levels of DNMT3B7 in differentiated tumors associated with more favorable outcomes, we
hypothesized that DNMT3B7 could modify neuroblastoma
phenotype. We introduced DNMT3B7 into an N-type neuroblastoma cell line (LA1-55n) using a Tet-off inducible system.
Repression of cell growth in the DNMT3B7-expressing cell lines
was seen after 10 days of induction (P < 0.001; Fig. 2A). The
expression of DNMT3B7 was evaluated by Western blot analysis at each time point (Fig. 2B). DNMT3B7 expression was low
during the ﬁrst week and increased as the growth of the cells
decreased. The level of DNMT3B7-expression in the induced
cells was two-fold higher than what was found in ganglioneuroblastoma tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Similar results
were obtained using constitutive expression of DNMT3B7 in
another N-type neuroblastoma cell line, SMS-KCNR (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Aberrant DNMT3B transcripts are expressed in primary
neuroblastoma tumors
To investigate signiﬁcance of aberrant DNMT3B transcripts
in neuroblastoma, reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis was performed on a hypothesis-generating cohort of three
ganglioneuroblastoma, three ganglioneuromas, and 25 primary neuroblastoma samples using primers that ampliﬁed all but
2 of the known alternative and aberrant DNMT3B isoforms (Fig.
1A, Supplementary Fig. S1A, Table 1). Additional DNMT3B
transcripts were detected by Southern blot using a DNMT3B
probe that hybridizes to all of the known aberrant isoforms
ampliﬁed in the RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S1B and C). We
stratiﬁed the patients into two risk groups: high risk and
nonhigh risk. Nonhigh-risk patients included those with stages
1 and 2 disease, infants with stages 4 and 4S tumors, and
patients with stage 3 tumors that lacked MYCN ampliﬁcation.
Similar to the criteria used by the COG, patients with stage 3
MYCN-ampliﬁed tumors and children older than 1 year of age
with stage 4 disease were considered high risk (4). We found the
expression of four or more aberrant DNMT3B isoforms correlated with higher risk groups (P ¼ 0.03). The identity of
DNMT3B7 was conﬁrmed by sequencing in four primary
tumors (data not shown), and expression of DNMT3B7 was
quantiﬁed in the primary tumors by real-time RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S2A). We obtained ten more ganglioneuroblastoma RNAs from the COG. However, the integrity of the
RNA was too low to determine the levels of DNMT3B isoforms
(data not shown). We therefore hypothesized that high levels of
DNMT3B7 may contribute to the more benign clinical behavior
of the most differentiated tumors.
Neuroblastoma cell lines showed expression patterns of
DNMT3B transcripts similar to that of the primary tumors by
RT-PCR (Fig. 1B). Tumorigenic N-type cells (24) had an increased
number of DNMT3B transcripts and lacked DNMT3B7. By Western blot, we found the N-type cells have only full-length
DNMT3B, whereas nontumorigenic S-type cells had both fulllength DNMT3B and the truncated DNMT3B7 (Fig. 1C).

tumors were thin-walled and structurally more normal (Fig. 3B,
ii and D, ii) than in the control tumors (Fig. 3B, i and D, i).
Cell proliferation in the DNMT3B7-positive xenografts was
evaluated by Ki-67 expression, a nuclear protein that is preferentially expressed during active phases of the cell cycle. Ki-67
negative cells, representing quiescent G0 phase cells, are more
abundant in the DNMT3B7-expressing tumors (Fig. 3B, vi and
D, vi) than in control tumors (Fig. 3B, v and D, v). Signiﬁcantly
higher numbers of neuroblasts in G0 were detected in SMSKCNR tumors with DNMT3B7 expression, compared to control
tumors (39.2  3.5 vs. 14.4  1.9, respectively: P < 0.001;
Supplementary Fig. S4B). TUNEL assays demonstrated that
2.5-fold more apoptotic cells were present in the DNMT3B7positive xenografts compared to controls (P < 0.01; Supplementary Fig. S4C). Overall, these results show that expression
of DNMT3B7 in two neuroblastoma xenograft mouse models
leads to tumors with a less aggressive phenotype.

Cells with DNMT3B7 expression have higher levels of
global DNA methylation
We have shown previously that DNMT3B7 expression in an
Em-Myc transgenic mouse model resulted in an increase in
global DNA methylation (21). To determine if the expression of
DNMT3B7 in the LA1-55n cells also increases DNA methylation, we measured global DNA methylation levels. As shown
in Fig. 4A, signiﬁcantly higher levels of DNA methylation were
detected in the LA1-55n cells expressing DNMT3B7 as compared to vector control cells. We found the Satellite 2
repetitive elements had more DNA methylation following
DNMT3B7-expression in the LA1-55n cells (Supplementary
Fig S5). The increase in DNA methylation was also seen in
both DNMT3B7-expressing xenografts. A statistically significant increase in total 5-methylcytosine levels was seen in
the DNMT3B7-expressing xenografts compared to controls
(P < 0.01, Fig. 4B), indicating that the pattern of DNA
methylation is modiﬁed in the presence of the truncated
DNMT3B7. Because we identiﬁed high levels of DNMT3B7 in
ganglioneuroblastomas, we hypothesized that this would
correlate with global DNA methylation levels. We found no
difference between low, intermediate, and high-risk groups.
However, there was a statistically signiﬁcant increase in

tumors (28, 65-1 and 2235), two of which have the highest
level of DNMT3B7 expression seen in any primary tumor
(Fig. 4C).
DNMT3B7 expression induces changes in gene
expression and DNA methylation
To investigate the effects of DNMT3B7 on gene expression,
we used RNA-Seq to compare the gene expression proﬁles of
two independent DNMT3B7-expressing LA1-55n cells to vector
control cells after 21 days of induction. After eliminating the
genes with fewer than 150 reads per cell and those that had less
than a three-fold change in either of the two DNMT3B7expressing cell lines compared to the vector control, there
were 144 genes that had at least an average ﬁve-fold change in
the two DNMT3B7-expressing cell lines compared to the vector
control cells (Supplementary Table S2). RNA-Seq conﬁrmed
the expression of DNMT3B7 only in the transduced cells
(Supplementary Fig. S6). Similar to the expression of DNMT3B7
in Em-Myc transgenic mice (21), we found the expression of
DNMT1, DNMT3A and endogenous DNMT3B was unchanged in
the induced cells according to RNA-Seq, and real-time RT-PCR
identiﬁed subtle increases in DNMT3A and DNMT3B (Supplementary Fig S7A to C). Among 117 genes with increased
expression in the two DNMT3B7-expressing lines, 86 (73.5%)
genes contained a CpG island, and 22 of the 27 (81.5%) of the
genes with decreased expression contained a CpG island.
Interestingly, eight of the 27 (29.6%) genes with decreased

seven (25.9%) are on chromosome 19p (P < 0.0001). Copy
number loss of chromosome 19 has been reported in 12.5%
of neuroblastoma tumors (25, 26). No other chromosomal
clustering of genes altered by DNMT3B7-expression was
detected.
To identify genes that could contribute to the suppression
of neuroblastoma cell growth in the presence of DNMT3B7,
we focused on genes with the greatest fold changes by RNASeq that had CpG islands: ANKRD12 (22-fold), ASPM (15-fold),
and EEA1 (14-fold; increased expression); and FOSB (46-fold),
ARC (21-fold), EGR1 (18-fold), and FOS (11-fold; decreased
expression). In addition, we performed a GeneGo pathway
analysis of all of the genes with at least a ﬁve-fold average
change in expression with at least 150 reads per cell (Supplementary Table S2), which identiﬁed an additional ﬁve genes
of interest: three genes that encode members of the AP1
complex that were underexpressed in the DNMT3B7-expressing cell lines FOSB (45-fold) and FOS (11-fold), both identiﬁed
above, and JUNB (6-fold); genes important in neuronal function and tumorigenesis: KIF20B (11-fold), ROCK1 (6-fold), APC
(5-fold), and RXRB (6-fold), encoding a retinoic acid signaling
coregulator that heterodimerizes with retinoic acid receptors
to bind on target gene promoters at the retinoic acid response
element, which is important for retinoic acid treatment
of children with high-risk neuroblastoma (12). In total, we
performed quantitative real-time RT-PCR of all twelve genes
of interest (Fig. 5A and B).

To test if the differential expression of genes in the
DNMT3B7-expressing LA1-55n cells was the result of an alteration in their DNA methylation patterns, we performed bisulﬁte sequencing of eight genes that had been validated by realtime RT-PCR. Six of these genes showed no detectable DNA
methylation across the transcriptional start site. RXRB, a gene
important in retinoic acid signaling, showed a decrease expression of two-fold in DNMT3B7-expressing cells by real-time RTPCR, and the CpG island surrounding the transcriptional start
site was hypermethylated in the presence of DNMT3B7 (Fig.
5C). Similarly, EEA1 expression was nine-fold higher by realtime RT-PCR, and the CpG island upstream of the transcriptional start site became completely hypomethylated in
DNMT3B7-expressing cells (Fig. 5D). The changes in DNA
methylation were validated by LC/MS (Supplementary Fig.
S8). These data show that expression of DNMT3B7 in neuro-

The effects of ATRA and DNMT3B7 expression on growth
inhibition are additive
RNA-Seq of the DNMT3B7-expressing LA1-55n cells revealed
decreased expression of genes encoding components of the
AP1 complex, FOSB (45-fold), FOS (11-fold), and JUNB (6-fold).
In addition to acting as a transcription factor, AP1 can also
antagonize the activity of retinoic acid receptors (27). We
therefore hypothesized that, with reduced levels of AP1, retinoic acid receptors would be more active and could drive
DNMT3B7-expressing cells toward differentiation. To test if
retinoic acid treatment could augment the ability of DNMT3B7
to induce differentiation of neuroblastoma cells, we induced
DNMT3B7 expression in the LA1-55n cells for 2 weeks to
maximize DNMT3B7 expression (Fig. 2B). After 2 weeks of
induction, both DNMT3B7-expressing cells and control cells
were treated either with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or
vehicle for 7 days. We found that the effects of ATRA treatment
and DNMT3B7 expression on growth inhibition were additive
(Fig. 6A), not synergistic.
To test if DNMT3B7-expressing cells were more differentiated than control cells, we studied the expression of 22 known
neuroblastoma differentiation markers (28–33) and found that
18 of them had expression changes that correlated with a more
differentiated phenotype (Supplementary Table S3). We validated the two genes with the greatest fold changes: GFRA1 and
DLK1. GFRA1 encodes GDNF family receptor alpha 1 and has
been shown to enhance differentiation in response to GDNF
(34). GFRA1 expression was two-fold higher in two independent DNMT3B7-expressing LA1-55n cell lines, compared to
vector control (Fig. 6B left, dark gray bars). After ATRA
treatment, GFRA1 expression was further increased in all cell
lines (Fig. 6B left, light gray bars), and this increase was greater
in the DNMT3B7-expressing cells. DLK1 encodes delta-like 1
homolog (Drosophila) and has been identiﬁed as a stem cell
gene that negatively regulates differentiation (35). The expression of DLK1 in DNMT3B7-expressing cells was decreased up to
two-fold in two independent DNMT3B7-expressing LA1-55n
cell lines (Fig. 6B right, dark gray bars). After ATRA treatment,
DLK1 expression was further decreased in all cell lines (Fig. 6B
left, light gray bars), and the expression in the DNMT3B7expressing cells was signiﬁcantly lower than in the vector
control cells. Taken together, these results suggest a model
in which the expression of DNMT3B7 induces neuroblastoma
cells to differentiate, which can be promoted further by additional treatment by ATRA.

Discussion
DNMT3B catalyzes de novo methylation of DNA sequences,
and high levels of this enzyme have been detected in cancer
(36). In addition to full-length DNMT3B, more than 40 transcripts have been detected in common adult malignant tumors
(18, 37). Many of the encoded proteins lack either the DNA
binding or catalytic domains, and some have been shown to
modify the pattern of DNA methylation and gene expression

(18, 20). In this study, we found DNMT3B7 transcripts in all of
the ganglioneuromas tested and at very high levels in all of the
ganglioneuroblastomas, leading us to the hypothesis that
DNMT3B7 could induce differentiation and lead to a more
benign phenotype, thereby modifying tumor phenotype in
pediatric neuroblastoma.
To test this hypothesis, we forced DNMT3B7 expression in
neuroblastoma cells using retroviral vectors to drive either
constitutive or inducible expression and evaluated its effects
on DNA methylation, tumor growth, and angiogenesis. We
observed growth inhibition of aggressive neuroblastoma cell
lines and xenograft tumors with slowed tumor growth and
suppression of angiogenesis. Although aberrant hypermethylation of speciﬁc tumor suppressor genes and a CpG-methylator phenotype have been associated with clinically aggressive

4720

Cancer Res; 72(18) September 15, 2012

neuroblastomas (37), cancer cells are globally hypomethylated
compared to normal cells. Thus, the increase in global DNA
methylation observed in neuroblastoma cells with forced
DNMT3B7 expression and decreased tumor growth are consistent with a non-malignant phenotype.
Previously, we have demonstrated altered DNA methylation and gene expression in 293 cells overexpressing
DNMT3B7 (18). In addition, a re-distribution of DNA methylation was observed in DNMT3B7 transgenic mice (21).
Forced expression of other DNMT3B isoforms containing
the catalytic domain (DDNMT3B1-4) have been shown to
induce hypermethylation of repetitive elements (38). The
truncated DNMT3B variants that lack DNA binding or
catalytic domains are likely to have altered function compared with DNMT3B, and may actually stimulate the activity

of other DNMTs with which it heterodimerizes (39), leading
to hypermethylation.
GeneGo pathway analysis of the RNA-Seq data of the
DNMT3B7-expressing LA1-55n cells identiﬁed several genes
that may be important in neuroblastoma pathogenesis:
KIF20B, ROCK1, ROCK2, APC and genes encoding members of
the AP1 complex: FOSB, FOS, and JUNB. Increased expression of
KIF1A has been found to correlate with high-risk neuroblastoma tumors (40). ROCK1 (six-fold) and ROCK2 (six-fold) were
both underexpressed in DNMT3B7-expressing cells, and activated RhoA and its downstream effector ROCK have been
shown to be negative regulators of growth cone motility (41).
Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is a tumor suppressor gene,
highly expressed in the developing and adult nervous system,
which is involved in neurite formation (42, 43), and apoptosis of
neural crest cells (44).
Additionally, GeneGo pathway analysis of the RNA-Seq
data revealed decreased expression of genes encoding the
components of the AP1 complex, which can antagonize the
activity of retinoic acid receptors through protein-protein
interaction without requiring DNA binding (27). We therefore hypothesized that, with reduced levels of AP1, retinoic
acid receptors would be more active in the DNMT3B7expressing cells, allowing augmentation of differentiation
by retinoid treatment. Indicative of increased differentiation,
DNMT3B7-expressing LA1-55n cells had higher expression of
GFRA1 compared to vector controls following ATRA treatment. Similarly, the expression of DLK1 was decreased in
both DNMT3B7-expressing LA1-55n cell lines following

ATRA treatment (Fig. 6B). It has been shown previously
that ATRA treatment of another MYCN ampliﬁed neuroblastoma cell line (SK-N-BE) leads to promoter hypomethylation (14), although we did not observe any signiﬁcant
global changes in DNA methylation after ATRA treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S9). In the future, screening neuroblastoma tumors for DNMT3B7-expression may indicate
particular patients for whom ATRA treatment might be
particularly effective. DNMT3B exists in a protein complex
with the mitotic chromatin condensation components, including HDAC1 and SIN3A (45). When unbound, retinoic
acid receptors bind NCOR2, SIN3A, and HDACs, leading to
target promoter repression, which can be disassociated
upon ATRA binding (46, 47).
Altered histone modiﬁcations have also been found in
neuroblastoma tumors and have correlated to tumor aggressiveness. Elevated levels of EZH2, the enzymatically active
component of the Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 and
H3K27me3 marks have been identiﬁed at the promoters of
tumor suppressors CASZ1, RUNX1, NGFR (p75), and NTRK1
(TrkA) in undifferentiated, poor prognosis neuroblastoma (48).
Additionally, following retinoic acid induced differentiation of
neuroblastoma cells, EZH2 expression is decreased, consistent
with decreased binding of EZH2 to retinoic acid inducible
target genes (49). Retinoic acid treatment therefore, leads to a
reduction in repressive histone marks in addition to the
changes in DNA methylation described above. Therefore,
future work may focus on testing whether histone modiﬁcations are altered in this system.

Ostler et al.

Our ﬁndings suggest that forced expression of DNMT3B7 in
neuroblastoma cells is able to drive genome-wide DNA methylation. This is similar to the effects seen in lymphomas that
arise in Em-Myc/DNMT3B7 transgenic mice (21). However, in
neuroblastoma, the expression of DNMT3B7 is anti-tumorigenic (Fig. 3), whereas DNMT3B7 expression in Em-Myc lymphomas accelerates tumorigenesis. There are many possible
explanations for this: The observations are made in different
species and cell types. In addition, there are no other aberrant
DNMT3B transcripts present in the DNMT3B7-Em-Myc lymphomas, whereas the human LA1-55n neuroblastoma cell
expresses multiple DNMT3B transcripts. Truncated DNMT3B
proteins may ﬁne-tune the DNA methylation machinery within
a cell dependent upon the other active DNMTs. These studies
provide insight into understanding the molecular basis for the
altered distribution of DNA methylation seen in virtually all
human cancers. We hope that our discoveries will also provide
a basis for novel diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic strategies that will be applicable to neuroblastoma and other types
of tumors.
