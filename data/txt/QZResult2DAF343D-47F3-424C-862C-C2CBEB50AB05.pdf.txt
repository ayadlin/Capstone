BACKGROUND. The purpose was to determine the prevalence and treatmentrelated risk factors for obesity and hypertension among childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors treated with contemporary therapy.

METHODS. In a single-center longitudinal study, serial body mass indices (BMI)
and blood pressure (BP) measurements of children ages 2–20 at time of ALL diagnosis and enrolled on pediatric cooperative group trials from 1993–2003 were
abstracted from medical records and converted to population-referenced zscores.

RESULTS. Among 165 study participants, BMI z-scores increased significantly
between diagnosis (median age 4.8 years) and therapy completion. At the end of
therapy, 17.0% of survivors were overweight (BMI of 25–29, or 85–94% for age),
21.2% were obese (BMI 30, or 95% for age), and 15.3% had BP meeting stage
11 hypertension thresholds (systolic or diastolic BP 140/90 mm Hg, or 95% for
age and height plus 5 mm Hg). These proportions were found to be unchanged
2-3 years later. In multivariate analysis, the highest level of corticosteroid exposure was associated with both obesity (odds ratio [OR] 6.0; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.2–28.5) as well as stage 11 hypertension (OR 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2–5.1)
compared with the lowest level. Females also were more likely to have increased
BMI and elevated BP compared with males. Treatment intensity and cranial
radiotherapy were not found to be associated with BMI or BP changes.

CONCLUSIONS. Despite reductions in the use of cranial radiotherapy, contemporary childhood survivors of ALL remain at an increased risk of obesity and hypertension at least several years after the completion of treatment, with those
exposed to higher doses of corticosteroids at greater risk. Cancer 2007;110:2313–

now exceeds 80%, resulting in a growing cohort of survivors at
risk for long-term adverse health outcomes related to their cancer
therapy.1 Compared with the general population, survivors of pediatric ALL may have an increased risk of developing obesity and
hypertension.2 The development of obesity and hypertension during
childhood and adolescence increases the risk for adult obesity3 and
hypertension,4 and is often associated with insulin resistance and
dyslipidemia.5 The frequent clustering of these traits—obesity,
hypertension, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia—define the metabolic syndrome, a significant risk factor for diabetes and cardiovascular disease.5 Among ALL patients, cranial radiotherapy has been
the most frequently cited treatment-related risk factor for obesity6–13
and hypertension,14–16 although prolonged exposure to corticosteroids

may also play a role.8,9,17 However, because these associations have been identified primarily among patients
treated before 1990, they may not be applicable to
more contemporary regimens that utilize less cranial
radiotherapy but more intensive chemotherapy, including more potent corticosteroids.1 Studies that examined patients treated in the contemporary era have
reported increased obesity even in the absence of
radiotherapy,18,19 but to our knowledge have not identified which elements of chemotherapy may be responsible, nor have they examined blood pressure changes.
Therefore, we undertook a retrospective longitudinal analysis of changes in body mass indices (BMI)
and blood pressures (BP) among children treated for
ALL with contemporary therapy. Specifically, we
hypothesized that contemporary therapy for ALL
is associated with an increased risk of obesity
and hypertension because of greater corticosteroid
exposure, despite decreased cranial radiotherapy exposure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
Between January 1, 1993, and December 31, 2003,
206 children between the ages of 2 and 20 years
were newly diagnosed with ALL and treated according to Children’s Cancer Group protocols at Children’s Hospital and Regional Medical Center, Seattle.
Those with Down syndrome (n 5 7 children) and
those who died or experienced disease recurrence
during their initial treatment (n 5 14 children) were
excluded. An additional 20 children transferred care
to another institution before completing therapy,
leaving 165 children in the final analysis.
Exposure Measurements
Demographic and treatment information regarding
initial ALL treatment, including chemotherapy and
radiotherapy doses, was abstracted. Treatment for recurrence was not included because we were interested only in the effects of primary ALL treatment.
Treatment intensity was categorized as ‘standard’ or
‘high’ (Table 1). In general, standard intensity treatments featured a systemic 3-drug induction with corticosteroids, vincristine, and asparaginase, whereas
high-intensity therapies also included anthracyclines  cyclophosphamide during induction. After
induction, the composition of subsequent phases of
chemotherapy varied across protocols, but all featured consolidation and 1 or 2 delayed intensification
phases (also termed reinduction), followed by a long
maintenance phase lasting on average 2 years for
girls and 3 years for boys. For central nervous sys-

tem-directed treatment, all protocols utilized intrathecal chemotherapy; selected patients also received
cranial or craniospinal radiotherapy per protocol.
Dosages (in mg/m2) of prednisone and dexamethasone (multiplied by 7 to approximate prednisone equivalence) were summed to determine
cumulative corticosteroid exposure and then categorized using tertiles. Patients typically received 1
month of a daily corticosteroid during induction, followed by shorter pulses throughout the remainder of
treatment. Dosages (in mg/m2) of doxorubicin, daunorubicin, and idarubicin (multiplied by 3 to approximate doxorubicin equivalence) were summed to

determine cumulative anthracycline exposure and
then dichotomized. Dosages of other chemotherapy
agents were not abstracted. Because relatively few
patients received cranial radiotherapy and doses
were limited to 18 or 24 grays (Gy), exposure was
classified as ‘yes/no’ only. Treatment-related complications that may affect risk for obesity or hypertension were abstracted and included growth hormone
deficiency, hyperglycemia requiring insulin, and malnutrition requiring parenteral nutrition or nasogastric
feeds.
Height, weight, BMI, and BP data were also
abstracted from the medical record. Timepoints of
interest included diagnosis, end of induction therapy
(1 month from diagnosis), beginning of maintenance
therapy (6 months from diagnosis), and yearly clinic
visits for routine oncology follow-up through December 31, 2006. Data were censored at time of disease
recurrence after the completion of initial treatment,
or at the time of last follow-up, whichever occurred
earlier. All procedures were approved by the hospital
Institutional Review Board.

Statistical Analyses
Outcomes of interest were changes in BMI and BP.
Patient height, weight, and BMI were converted to zscores, adjusting for age and sex using the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention’s Year 2000
growth charts (Epi Info, version 2002). Z-scores
represent the number of standard deviations a measurement is away from the mean. In this study, overweight was defined as a BMI of 25–29, or 85%–94%
for age or, whereas obesity was defined as a BMI
30, or 95% for age. Systolic and diastolic BP also
were converted to z-scores, adjusting for age, sex,
and height, based on published formulas.20 BP readings were also classified as normal, prehypertension
(systolic or diastolic BP of 90–94% or 120/80 mm
Hg), or stage 11 hypertension (systolic or diastolic BP
of 95% plus 5 mm Hg, or 140/90 mm Hg).20
The Student t-test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and
Fisher exact test were used in cross-sectional univariate analyses. Given the correlated nature of longitudinal data, generalized estimating equations (GEE)
with robust variances were used to model the association between outcomes and possible risk factors,
expressed as odds ratios (OR). Models adjusted for
time since ALL diagnosis, sex, ethnicity, birth year,
age at diagnosis, cumulative corticosteroid dose,
treatment intensity, and cranial radiotherapy exposure. Exposures such as anthracycline dose, growth
hormone deficiency, insulin requirement, and supplemental nutrition did not affect estimates and were
not included in the final models. Analysis of BMI

2315

changes also included adjustment for BMI z-score at
diagnosis. In analyzing BP changes, BMI at diagnosis
was not included because it did not affect BP estimates. BP at diagnosis were also excluded because
patients were often acutely ill at that timepoint.
Because of concern over possible bias introduced by
missing data, linear and generalized linear mixed
models were used in sensitivity analyses with similar
results to GEE. Results using GEE are presented
because we were interested in population-averaged
rather than subject-specific estimates. The STATA
(version 9; StataCorp, College Station, TX) and SAS
(version 8; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) software
programs were used for the analysis.

RESULTS
Demographic and treatment characteristics of the
study cohort are presented in Table 1. Although
height z-scores did not change significantly between
diagnosis and last follow-up (P 5 .28), both weight
and BMI z-scores increased significantly during this
time interval (P < .01) (Fig. 1). The majority of patients
(77.6%) received both prednisone and dexamethasone
as part of their ALL treatment. Compared with
females, males had higher median prednisone (7840
mg/m2 vs 5440 mg/m2; P < .01) and overall corticosteroid exposure (9800 mg/m2 vs 7330 mg/m2; P < .01),
but other treatment exposures were similar, including cumulative dexamethasone and anthracycline
doses. The difference in corticosteroid exposure
reflected the longer average duration of treatment
boys experienced versus girls (3.1  0.3 years vs
2.2  0.1 years; P < .01). The distribution of demographic and treatment characteristics were otherwise
similar across corticosteroid exposure levels. There
also was no difference in baseline body measurements between those exposed to insulin or supplementation nutrition versus those who were not. Nine
patients were diagnosed with and treated for growth
hormone deficiency, but their change in height,
weight, and BMI z-scores from the time of ALL diagnosis to last follow-up was similar to those without
growth hormone deficiency.
When the study cohort was dichotomized by
number of follow-up observations (<8 vs 8), there
were no significant demographic or treatment differences noted between the 2 groups except that those
with fewer visits were more likely to experience disease recurrence (28.0% vs 2.2%; P < .01). There were
no significant differences with respect to sex, race,
birth year category, or diagnosis age between the
study cohort and those patients who were excluded
(n 5 34) because of disease recurrence or death
before therapy completion, or institutional transfer.

Over the course of ALL treatment, the percentage
of patients who were overweight or obese increased
from 12.7% and 10.9%, respectively, at the time of diagnosis to 17.0% and 21.2%, respectively, at the end
of therapy (P 5 .01). Five years from diagnosis, 21.2%
of patients were overweight and 20.0% obese, percentages that remained stable over succeeding years.
Less than 2% were underweight after the completion
of therapy.
BP z-scores were highest at the end of induction
therapy, with 63.3% of patients meeting criteria for
stage 11 hypertension compared with 15.3% at the
end of therapy (Fig. 2). However, at the end of therapy, the average systolic and diastolic z-scores were
still elevated versus population norms (0.56  1.03
and 0.35  0.67, respectively; both P < .01). Five
years from diagnosis, diastolic z-scores were no longer distinct from population norms (0.04  0.69;

P 5 .60), although systolic values remained significantly elevated (0.50  1.03; P < .01) and the proportion of patients with values meeting stage 11
hypertension thresholds (14.1%) was unchanged
from therapy completion. Overall, 79 patients had 3
BP measurements after therapy completion. Among
them, 11 patients (13.9%) had 3 observations in the
prehypertension range and 4 patients (5.1%) met
stage 11 hypertension thresholds on at least 3 occasions. No patients were noted to be receiving antihypertensive medications during this time.
On multivariate analysis, several host and treatment-related risk factors for obesity and hypertension emerged, including corticosteroid dose, sex, and
age at time of diagnosis. Corticosteroid dose was
associated with both increased BMI z-scores and an
increased risk of obesity (Table 2). The risk of obesity
associated with the highest level of corticosteroid

exposure compared with the lowest level was an OR
of 6.0 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.2–28.5).
Higher levels of corticosteroids were also associated
with an increased risk of stage 11 hypertension (OR
of 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2–5.1).
Compared with boys, girls were more likely to
have increased BMI (z-score change 0.39; 95% CI,
0.13–0.65). The risk of becoming obese was found to
be elevated 2-fold among girls compared with boys,
but was not statistically significant. Female sex also
was associated with increased systolic BP (z-score
change 0.40; 95% CI, 0.10–0.71), borderline diastolic
BP (z-score change 0.15; 95% CI, 20.02–0.31), and
stage 11 hypertension (OR of 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0–2.9).
Younger age at diagnosis (<5 years of age) was
associated with increased systolic BP (z-score change
0.79; 95% CI, 0.30–1.28), diastolic BP (z-score change
0.61; 95% CI, 0.36–0.86), and stage 11 hypertension
(OR of 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1–6.5) compared with age 10
years. However, younger age at diagnosis was not
associated with BMI z-score changes, overweight, or
obesity.
Treatment intensity and cranial radiotherapy
were not found to be independently associated with
changes in BMI or BP. Multivariate estimates were
not found to be significantly different if patients who
later experienced disease recurrence were excluded
entirely from analysis.

DISCUSSION
In the current study, the proportion of childhood
ALL survivors with age-adjusted BMI 85% after the
completion of therapy (38%) was higher than the
proportion observed in the general U.S. population
(31%; ages 6–19 years21). This difference was even

greater when compared with Washington State data,
in which 25% of 8th to 12th graders were reported to
be overweight or obese in recent surveys.22 In contrast, the prevalence of children with an age-adjusted
BMI 85% at time of diagnosis in this study (24%;
median age of 4.8 years) was similar to the U.S. average (23% among those ages 2–5 years, 31% among
those ages 6–11 years21; Washington State data not
available). Although precancer diagnosis measurements were unavailable, prior studies suggest that
malnutrition at time of ALL diagnosis is rare in
developed countries.23
The risk of an increased BMI compared with
population controls has been previously reported
among survivors of childhood ALL,6–19 with most studies examining patients treated before 1990, when
cranial radiotherapy combined with less intensive
chemotherapy regimens were used more commonly.
Cranial radiotherapy >20 Gy was a commonly identified risk factor for increased BMI among patients in
these studies.8,10,12,13 Cranial radiotherapy was not
found to be a significant risk factor for increased
BMI in the current study population, but the majority of patients in the current study who received cranial radiotherapy were treated with 18 Gy. One
recently published study did not find adult survivors
of childhood ALL to be at increased risk of obesity,
but the majority of patients on that study received
either intensified intrathecal chemotherapy or 18 Gy
of cranial radiotherapy, and relatively low doses of
corticosteroids.24 Similar to some prior studies,
female sex7,11,12 and younger age at diagnosis7,12,18
remained risk factors for increased BMI in our study.
We also identified an increased proportion of
children with BP in the hypertensive range after the

2318

CANCER

completion of therapy compared with population
norms. Several other single-institution studies have
examined the prevalence of hypertension and other
cardiovascular risk factors, including the metabolic
syndrome phenotype, among survivors of childhood
ALL treated predominantly before 1990. In a U.S.
study, approximately 20% of young adult survivors
had increased BP and/or markers of insulin resistance, whereas the prevalence of obesity and dyslipidemia was approximately 30%.15 The prevalence of
metabolic syndrome was 16% among adolescent and
young adult Finnish survivors of pediatric cancer
(56% of whom had ALL) compared with 0% among
population controls.14 In both of these studies, exposure to cranial radiotherapy and associated growth
hormone deficiency were more common among
those with cardiovascular risk factors. However,
another U.S. study found no difference in metabolic
syndrome prevalence between adult ALL survivors
and population norms, although in subset analyses
those exposed to cranial radiotherapy appeared to be
at higher risk of meeting some metabolic syndromerelated trait definitions.16
Increased corticosteroid exposure was associated
with both increased BMI and BP in the current study,
independent of treatment intensity. The mechanisms
by which corticosteroids mediate these effects are
complex and incompletely understood, but likely
involve increased gluconeogenesis, changes in fat
metabolism and distribution, as well as the promotion of inotropic and vasoconstrictive effects on the
cardiovascular system.25 Although to our knowledge
no study of childhood cancer survivors has reported
a link between hypertension and corticosteroid dose,
corticosteroid dose-response was examined in 2 studies of BMI change among survivors treated before
1990. One reported a borderline increased effect on
BMI,9 whereas the other found no effect.10 These
results may differ from those of the current study
because of changes in corticosteroid dosing between
the treatment eras studied. Since the 1970s, cumulative corticosteroid dosing has increased by as much
as 60% to 80% with the addition of corticosteroid
pulses during the postinduction delayed intensification treatment phase26 and during the maintenance
phase for a larger number of patients.27 In addition,
over the past 15 years there has been increased use
of dexamethasone in ALL protocols. Although the
per-dose glucocorticoid equivalency of dexamethasone is similar to prednisone, dexamethasone differs
from prednisone in other aspects, including a substantially longer duration of action and improved
central nervous system penetration, as well as a
higher incidence of avascular necrosis, hyperglyce-

mia, and myopathy.28 Unfortunately, we were unable
to distinguish between prednisone and dexamethasone dose effects because the majority of patients
received both types of steroid. However, others have
reported that dexamethasone may have a greater
effect on weight gain compared with prednisone, at
least during the treatment period.8,9,17 Both prednisone and dexamethasone can temporarily increase
energy intake, even when given as monthly 5-day
pulses during maintenance chemotherapy.29 Given
the number of such pulses over the 2-year to 3-year
course of ALL treatment, this may explain some of
the weight gain observed. Steroid-related myopathy,
vincristine-related neuropathy, and psychosocial
responses to illness also may contribute to decreased
physical activity and exercise capacity noted among
children treated for ALL, leading to further weight
gain and increased BP.30–32
This study has several limitations. Although the
prevalence of obesity and hypertension appeared to
be stable after the completion of therapy, the median
duration of follow-up was less than 6 years, with the
majority of patients only in early adolescence at the
time of last follow-up and less than half having more
than 3 observations after the completion of therapy.
Because childhood weight, BP, and insulin resistance
often track into adulthood, further follow-up will be
required to determine whether this patient population will experience increased adult morbidity and
mortality from diabetes and cardiovascular disease
compared with population rates.3,4,33
The use of retrospective data also limited interpretability. All anthropometric measurements were
performed in a pediatric clinical setting in which
they were obtained by trained staff and therefore systematic measurement error appears unlikely. Any BP
measurement biases arising from incorrect cuff size
or poorly calibrated measurement devices should be
nondifferential, although insufficient rest/quiet time
before measurements may falsely elevate values. It
also is possible that elevated BP may reflect ‘white
coat’ hypertension instead of true hypertension. Up
to half of pediatric patients with hypertension in a
clinical setting may have normal BP as determined
by ambulatory BP monitoring performed in a nonclinical setting.34 Adult survivors of childhood cancer
also tend to report increased anxiety and other mood
disturbances compared with controls30 and this may
contribute to situational hypertension. However,
‘white coat’ hypertension typically decreases with
repeated clinic visits35 and a significant proportion of
patients in the current study continued to have elevated BP many years after treatment. Furthermore,
situational hypertension would not explain the dose-

Obesity and Hypertension After ALL Therapy/Chow et al.

response observed with corticosteroids, because
treatment-related variables such as treatment intensity, recurrence rate, and death did not differ across
exposure levels.
Finally, only those patients enrolled as part of
investigative protocols were analyzed in the current
study. Although it is possible that there may be some
differences between this population and those treated on noninvestigative protocols, greater than 70%
of children (age <20 years) diagnosed with leukemia
nationwide are enrolled on cooperative group studies, with overall enrollment rates for all pediatric
cancers typically higher for western Washington
State.36 Older age at diagnosis and nonwhite ethnicity were associated with decreased enrollment36 and
adjusted for in our analysis to minimize possible
biases.
Given the overall success of current treatment
regimens in treating childhood ALL, including the integral role of corticosteroids, any modification of current regimens that could compromise survival rates
is unlikely. Instead, care providers should pay closer
attention to age-adjusted BMI and BP values during
follow-up and direct future research toward interventions to decrease obesity and hypertension. Exploration of physical activity and diet may lead to the
identification of factors that may be more amenable
to modification during and after the successful completion of therapy. More in-depth analysis of host
risk factors also may identify a subset of individuals
who are more susceptible to the adverse effects of
prolonged high-dose corticosteroid administration,
such as those with a family history of obesity and
hypertension, and help uncover genetic polymorphisms linked to corticosteroid action and metabolism.
