Overexpression of the Mitochondrial Folate and Glycine–
Serine Pathway: A New Determinant of Methotrexate
Selectivity in Tumors
Alexei Vazquez1, Philip M. Tedeschi2, and Joseph R. Bertino3

Abstract
Previous studies have documented the roles of transport via the reduced folate carrier, retention via
polyglutamylation, and increased levels of the target enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase in sensitivity to methotrexate. Recent studies have shown that the mitochondrial enzymes in the cellular metabolism of serine, folate,
and glycine are overexpressed in a subset of human cancers and that their expression is required for tumor
maintenance. In this Perspective article, we propose that the expression of mitochondrial enzymes in the
metabolism of serine and glycine, in addition to those involved in folate metabolism, are determinants of the
response to methotrexate. Furthermore, we show that myc activation in tumors is associated with upregulation of
these enzymes. We propose that patients whose tumors show this phenotype will be sensitive to folate antagonists
targeting thymidylate or purine biosynthesis. Cancer Res; 73(2); 478–82. Ó2012 AACR.

Introduction
Previous studies have documented the roles of transport via
the reduced folate carrier (RFC), retention via polyglutamylation, and increased levels of the target enzyme, dihydrofolate
reductase in sensitivity to the folate antagonists methotrexate,
pralatrexate, and pemetrexed (1). Although these factors
explain in part why tumor cells are sensitive or resistant to
antifolates, they do not fully account for selectivity. Two recent
publications have now provided insight about why some
tumor cells, as compared with normal replicating cells, are
sensitive to methotrexate: Cancer cells that undergo metabolic
reprogramming and are characterized by rapid proliferation
and upregulate glycine consumption and metabolism are
potently inhibited by methotrexate, whereas normal cells with
similar proliferative rates are not as sensitive.
The contribution by Jain and colleagues (2) showed that
metabolic reprogramming that occurs in cancer may lead to
higher expression of the mitochondrial glycine biosynthetic
pathway and upregulation of mitochondrial folate enzymes
that include serine hydroxymethyl transferase (SHMT2),
methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD2), and
tetrahydrofolate synthetase (MTHFD1L; Fig. 1). The upregulation of these mitochondrial enzymes correlated with
increased proliferation, whereas the folate cytosolic enzymes

were not upregulated. Unlike the trifunctional cytosolic
enzyme, MTHFD1, that contains methylenetetrahydrofolate
dehydrogenase, methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase, and
formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase activity, the mitochondrial
enzyme MTHFD2 is a bifunctional enzyme that contains
methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase and methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase activity. Formyltetrahydrofolate
synthetase activity is encoded by a separate enzyme,
MTHFD1L. These enzymes contribute to the synthesis and
use of glycine, methylene THF, and N-10 formyl THF for de novo
purine and thymidylate biosynthesis (Fig. 1).
Supporting the importance of the above pathway is the high
expression of mitochondrial 1-carbon pathway components in
embryos. A developmental period marked by high cell proliferation rates and embryogenesis requires signiﬁcant amounts
of protein, lipid, and nucleic acid synthesis, of similar nature to
neoplastic cells. MTHFD1L was found to be upregulated in
mouse embryos, with the mitochondria providing more than
75% of the 1-carbon units present in the cytoplasm used for
purine synthesis and other biosynthetic pathways (3).
MTHFD1L and MTHFD2 are targets of microRNA miR-9,
which may act as a tumor suppressor in regard to these and
other genes (4). High expression of miR-9 suppresses levels of
MTHFD1L and MTHFD2 and miR-9 has been found to be
downregulated in breast cancer cell lines (4). Increasing miR-9
levels or knocking down MTHFD2 both have antiproliferative
and proapoptotic effects in tumor cell lines, which suggests
that inhibitors of MTHFD2 may show similar effects.
Zhang and colleagues (5) isolated tumor-initiating cells from
primary non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and found that
upregulation of the enzyme glycine decarboxylase and other
glycine–serine enzymes was associated with increased rates of
proliferation and poorer outcome in patients with NSCLC.
Remarkably, cDNA of the glycine decarboxylase gene transformed 3T3 cells. Large increases in the levels of thymidylate

Figure 1. The role of the mitochondria in the generation of purines and
thymidylate for DNA synthesis. Reactions 1, 3, 4, and 5 occur in both the
mitochondria and the cytoplasm, with reaction 2 limited only to the
mitochondria. Reaction 1 and 2 are catalyzed by SHMT2 and the glycine
cleavage system, respectively. In the cytoplasm, reactions 3, 4, and 5 are
carried out by the trifunctional enzyme (MTHFD1); in the mitochondria, 2
enzymes are required (MTHFD2 catalyzes reactions 3 and 4 and
MTHFD1L catalyzes reaction 5). The enzyme 10-formyl tetrahydrofolate
dehydrogenase (not shown) has been reported to be absent in most
cancer cells (10). Serine hydroxymethytransferase (1); glycine oxidase

synthase (TS; ref. 6) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR;
unpublished data) by transfection of immortalized cells can
also cause transformation, and these ﬁndings are in accord
with the idea that upregulation of nucleotide synthesis is
associated with metabolic reprogramming and increased
tumor cell proliferation. The details of how this increase in
enzymes involved in nucleotide biosynthesis is associated with
malignant transformation are not clear. In the study by Zhang
and colleagues (5), the mitochondrial SHMT2 and MTHFD2
and MTHFD1L enzyme levels were not assessed, and emphasis
was focused on the role of glycine decarboxylase to generate
methylenetetrahydrofolate, the 1-carbon donor for thymidylate biosynthesis. Because the glycine decarboxylase enzyme
complex is also located in mitochondria of mammalian cells
(7), this further shows the role of the mitochondria in proliferation by supplying tumor cells with precursors for pyrimidine biosynthesis. In this regard, an earlier report showed that
transformation imposes a stress on cancer cells in that the
demand for nucleotide formation is difﬁcult for the cell to meet
(8). As suggested by both Jain and colleagues and Zhang and
colleagues (2, 5), inhibitors of glycine decarboxylase and/or
serine hydroxymethyl transferase may be novel targets for
tumors in which proliferation is driven by overexpression of
these enzymes.
Sensitivity to methotrexate in vitro and in vivo
Here, we provide evidence to show that known potent and
clinically approved inhibitors of thymidylate and purine biosynthesis, which include DHFR inhibitors methotrexate and

pralatrexate and the thymidylate synthase inhibitors 5-ﬂuorouracil and pemetrexed, show selectivity to rapidly proliferating tumors in patients with overexpression of genes coding
for folate metabolism enzymes. To test this hypothesis, we
analyzed in vitro data reported by the Genomics of Drug
Sensitivity in Cancer at the Sanger Institute (Hinxton, Cambridge, UK; ref. 9) to determine whether upregulation of the
mitochondrial folate enzymes was correlated with sensitivity
to methotrexate, a potent inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase,
and when converted intracellularly to polyglutamates (10), an
inhibitor of two enzymes of purine synthesis, phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase (GARFT), and phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide formyltransferase (AICART).
A strong correlation between increased expression of 7 genes
and lower IC50 for methotrexate was observed (Fig. 2a), including the genes coding for the folate mitochondrial enzymes
SHMT2 (P ¼ 3.8  104) and GLDC (P ¼ 5.4  103), as well as
SLC19A1 (coding for the RFC, P ¼ 4.1  103), DHFR (P ¼ 3.6 
105–5.4  104), TYMS (TS, P ¼ 6.9  108), GART (GARFT,
P ¼ 3.6  103–1.7  102), and PHGDH (P ¼ 1.5  102).
These data support the hypothesis that methotrexate and
potentially other inhibitors of thymidylate and purine biosynthesis could be used to target cancers with high rates of
proliferation.
To provide further evidence, we analyzed a study reporting
the response of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL) to methotrexate treatment (11). This study reports the
leukemia cell counts before and after treatment together with
the leukemia gene expression proﬁles before treatment. We
used the fold change reduction in leukemia cell count as a
quantiﬁcation of sensitivity to methotrexate treatment. A
strong correlation was observed between the sensitivity to
methotrexate treatment and increased expression of the
genes coding for the folate mitochondrial enzymes SHMT2
(P ¼ 1.6  102) and MTHFD2 (P ¼ 3.8  102) as well as the
gene SLC19A1 (P ¼ 1.1  102) coding for the RFC (Fig. 2b).
Surprisingly, the expression of DHFR did not correlate with
the response to methotrexate, underscoring the need to
include the folate mitochondrial enzymes in the investigation
of the mechanisms of response to methotrexate.
What malignancies may be expected to be sensitive to
methotrexate?
Another key aspect is to have an estimate of the patient
population size that could be targeted using this approach. To
this end, we used, as a proxy, a set of genes coding for folate/
serine/glycine metabolism enzymes (folate metabolism:
SLC19A1, DHFR, TYMS, GART, ATIC, FPGS; serine synthesis:
PHGDH, PSAT1, PSPH; cytosolic serine/glycine/folate metabolism: SHMT1, MTHFD1; and mitochondrial serine/glycine/
folate metabolism: SHMT2, MTHFD2, MTHFD2L, AMT, DLD,
GLDC). We hypothesize that cancers overexpressing a subset of
these genes are more dependent on folate metabolism and,
therefore, could beneﬁt from treatment with methotrexate.
However, we note that this signature is not a predictor of
sensitivity to methotrexate, but rather a rough quantiﬁcation
of the potential beneﬁt from stratiﬁed therapy with methotrexate. For example, Fig. 2D shows the expression of the folate

metabolism genes in a cohort of patients with breast cancer.
The patients with breast cancer can be divided into 3 groups.
Fig. 2D shows the subset of cancers with a signiﬁcant upregulation (top, left) of the folate metabolism gene signature,
characterized by the concomitant expression of most genes in
the gene signature. The color-coded P value on the right
emphasizes in red those genes that tend to be coexpressed.
This group of patients is likely to beneﬁt from methotrexate
therapy because their cancers seem to be dependent on folate
metabolism. In contrast, the subset of cancers on the right
manifest a signiﬁcant downregulation of the folate metabolism gene signature (Fig. 2D, bottom) and the corresponding
patients are not expected to beneﬁt from methotrexate therapy. Finally, an intermediate group of patients has a mixed
phenotype (Fig. 2D, middle), and the response of these patients
cannot be anticipated unless we know which speciﬁc enzyme
mediates the response to methotrexate in this speciﬁc cancer
subtype.
Extending this type of analysis to other cancer types, we
observe that about 25% of cancers manifest a signiﬁcant
upregulation of the folate metabolism gene signature and
that patients with this feature are likely to beneﬁt from
treatment with methotrexate (Table 1). Some variations
exist depending on the cancer subtype, with colorectal cancers and lymphomas reaching slightly more than 30% to the
lowest value of about 10% in prostate cancers.
The concomitant expression of genes encoding for
enzymes in folate metabolism indicates a common regulatory mechanism. It is known that several serine, folate, and
glycine metabolism genes are targets of c-myc (PHGDH,
PSPH, SLC19A1, DHFR, TYMS, GART, SHMT1, MTHFD1,
MTHFD2, FGPS and GCSH; refs. 12, 13), and that their
expression is required for cell proliferation. Once again, we
used gene signatures as a proxy to quantify the activation of
c-myc targets (12) and cell proliferation (14). Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a typical example of a myc-driven cancer
(15). Indeed, from our analysis of a published dataset (16),
88% and 68% of lymphoma classiﬁed as BL and atypical BL,
respectively, manifest a signiﬁcant upregulation of the
c-myc gene signature (Fig. 2C). Furthermore, as previously
noticed (16), there is a group of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) that is also Myc driven. Indeed, 44% of the
DLBCLs manifest a signiﬁcant upregulation of the c-myc
signature. Focusing on the folate metabolism genes, the
P column in Fig. 2C highlights in red those genes that are

lymphomas with a signiﬁcant Myc signature upregulation.
In addition to DHFR (P ¼ 1.5  107–2.4  103 depending
on the microarray probe), we note the serine synthesis
genes PHGDH (P ¼ 9.7  1013), PSAT1 (P ¼ 6.1  104),
PSPH (P ¼ 1.5  104), and the mitochondrial gene SHMT2
(P ¼ 1.4  102). The correlation between the folate/serine/
glycine metabolism, c-Myc, and proliferation gene signatures is actually a universal feature of human cancers (17).
We also note a signiﬁcant correlation between the upregulation of the c-myc and proliferation signatures and the
response to methotrexate in both the in vitro and in vivo
studies (Fig. 2A and B, respectively). More precisely, in the
sensitive group, a signiﬁcant number of samples manifests
an upregulation of the c-myc (in vitro, P ¼ 5.1  104; in vivo,

Conclusions

Disclosure of Potential Conﬂicts of Interest

It will be important to learn whether known potent and
clinically approved inhibitors of thymidylate and purine biosynthesis, which include DHFR inhibitors methotrexate and
pralatrexate and the thymidylate synthase inhibitors 5-ﬂuorouracil and pemetrexed, show selectivity to rapidly proliferating
tumors in patients with overexpression of genes coding for
mitochondrial folate metabolism enzymes. Based on the concomitant overexpression of folate metabolism genes, we estimate that around 25% of patients with cancer manifest this
phenotype, and determination of this phenotype will allow
