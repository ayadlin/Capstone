Abstract
Cathepsin D (CD) up-regulation has been associated with
human malignancy and poor prognosis. Thrombin upregulated CD mRNA and protein in eight tumor cell lines
as well as in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells
(HUVEC). Thrombin increased the secretion of CD by 3- to
8-fold and enhanced chemotaxis (f2-fold) in 4T1 murine
mammary CA cells, which was completely inhibited with the
knockdown of CD. Secreted 4T1 CD induced neoangiogenesis
by 2.4-fold on a chick chorioallantoic membrane, which was
blocked in CD-KD cells. The addition of pure CD (2 ng) to
the chick chorioallantoic membrane increased angiogenesis
by 2.1-fold, which was completely inhibited by Pepstatin A
(Pep A). CD enhanced human HUVEC chemotaxis and Matrigel
tube formation by 2-fold, which was then blocked by Pep A.
CD enhanced HUVEC matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9)
activity by f2-fold, which was completely inhibited by Pep A
as well as a generic MMP inhibitor, GM6001. The injection
of CD-KD 4T1 cells into syngeneic mice inhibited tumor
growth by 3- to 4-fold compared with empty vector (EV) cells.
Hirudin, a specific thrombin inhibitor, inhibited the growth
of wild-type and EV cells by 2- to 3-fold, compatible with
thrombin up-regulation of CD. CD and thrombin also contributed to spontaneous pulmonary metastasis; 4-fold nodule
inhibition with CD versus EV and 4.6-fold inhibition with
hirudin versus EV (P < 0.02). Thus, thrombin-induced CD
contributes to the malignant phenotype by inducing tumor
cell migration, nodule growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis.
CD-induced angiogenesis requires the proteolytic activation
of MMP-9. [Cancer Res 2008;68(12):4666–73]

Introduction
Although the association of thrombosis and occult cancer has
been recognized for >140 years (1–4), the role of thrombin in
enhancing the malignant phenotype has only been recently
appreciated. Various studies using washed platelets treated with
exogenous thrombin and/or experimental pulmonary metastasis
(induced by tail vein injection of tumor cells grown in culture)
have been performed. These revealed enhanced tumor adhesion
to platelets, endothelial cells, fibronectin and von Willebrand’s
factor (5–8), growth (9), experimental metastasis (5, 6, 10–12),
and angiogenesis (13–18). Recent studies have tested the effect
of endogenous thrombin (hirudin treatment) on spontaneously
metastasizing 4T1 mammary tumor injected into the flank of syn-

geneic mice. Hirudin inhibition of tumor seeding into blood and
spontaneous pulmonary metastasis has provided more pathophysiologic relevance to these earlier studies (19).
Despite these observations, the precise mechanisms for these
reactions are poorly understood, except for angiogenesis, in which
the role of thrombin has been shown to be due to the up-regulation
of various vascular growth factors and receptors from tumor cells
as well as platelets and endothelial cells: vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF; refs. 13, 20–22), KDR (17, 23, 24), angiopoietin-2 (14), metalloproteinases 1 (25) and 2 (24), and most
recently, growth-regulated oncogene-a and its receptor (CXCR2;
ref. 24). Growth-regulated oncogene-a induces angiogenesis following thrombin-induced synthesis and secretion from both tumor
cells and primary endothelial cells (24).
To better understand the mechanisms involved in the thrombininduced malignant phenotype with respect to tumor growth and
metastasis, we performed an Affymetrix gene chip array on two
tumor cell lines, murine B16F10 melanoma and UMCL (undifferentiated murine cell line), to look for genes which could activate
or contribute to the promalignant phenotype. Numerous genes
were up-regulated or down-regulated over a 24-h exposure with
0.5 units/mL of thrombin. Of particular interest was the 2- to 4-fold
up-regulation of cathepsin D (CD), confirmed by mRNA and
protein analysis. We focused on CD because its up-regulation has
been associated with human malignancy and poor prognosis,
particularly with breast cancer (26–31). CD elevation is also a poor
prognostic marker for breast, ovarian, prostate, bladder, and melanoma cancer, and has been previously associated with increased
risk of relapse and metastasis (32, 33). A large-scale study of 2,810
node-negative breast cancer patients with a median follow-up of
88 months revealed that patients with a high or moderate CD level
in a primary tumor have a poor prognosis and relapse-free or
overall survival, independent of histologic grade, hormone receptor,
or tumor size (30).
CD is a lysosomal aspartyl glycoprotease (active at acidic pH)
which is found in intracellular vesicles, lysosomes, phagasomes,
and late endosomes. Its major area of function seems to be the
intracellular degradation of protein (regulating cell growth and
tissue homeostasis; ref. 32). It is a housekeeping gene necessary for
the development of newborn mice because CD( / ) mice undergo
progressive atrophy of the intestinal mucosa and destruction of
lymphoid organs (34). Procathepsin D has a molecular weight of
52 kDa, which is cleaved to a 48-kDa active intermediate that is
then cleaved in lysosomes to a mature two-chain 14 and 34 kDa
cathepsin enzyme with critical aspartic residues, one on each chain
(35, 36). Both procathepsin D and CD are overexpressed in mammary cancer by 2- to 50-fold (37) and can be secreted in the plasma
of patients with breast cancer (38, 39). Secreted procathepsin D can
stimulate growth and tumor cell proliferation of breast and
prostate cell lines (40–43). However, this has been reported not
to be related to its proteolytic function because the mutation of
its active proteolytic site does not affect its mitogenic activity

(44), suggesting that procathepsin D may be activating an unknown
extracellular receptor.
In this report, we show that (a) thrombin up-regulates CD in
eight different tumor cell lines as well as in a primary endothelial
cell line, (b) thrombin enhances the secretion of CD from six
different tumor cell lines tested, as well as in human umbilical
vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC), (c) CD directly stimulates
angiogenesis when applied to a chick chorioallantoic membrane
(CAM), (d) knockdown of CD with short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
in spontaneously metastatic breast carcinoma 4T1 cells inhibits
tumor nodule growth, seeding, metastasis, and angiogenesis in vivo
compared with empty vector (EV) cells.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Thrombin, thrombin receptor activation peptide
SFLLRNPNDKYEPF (TRAP), Pepstatin A (Pep A), and CD were purchased
from Sigma. The irrelevant control peptide, CAPESIEFPVSEARVLED, was
synthesized by Quality Control Biochemicals. Hirudin (Refludan) was
obtained from Hoechst Marion Roussel. Antibody to CD was purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)
inhibitor GM6001 was obtained from Chemicon International.
Cell lines and culture conditions. Human prostate cell line PC3, breast
carcinoma cell lines (MCF-7 and MD-MB-231), macrophage cell line THP1,
murine B16F10 melanoma, and breast carcinoma 4T1 cells were purchased
from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in DMEM (Sigma
Chemical Co.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life
Technologies), 2 mmol/L of L-glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin. The
undifferentiated mouse cell line (UMCL) was from our laboratory and was
maintained in DMEM. HUVECs were obtained from Cambrex Bioscience
and were maintained in EBM-2 (Cambrex Bioscience) supplemented with
2% FBS and growth factors according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The human brain microvascular endothelial cell line was provided by
Dr. Jorge Ghiso, New York University Medical Center, New York, NY. All cells
were grown at 37jC in 5% CO2. Tumor cells were starved overnight in the
absence of FBS prior to incubation with agonists.
Endothelial cell culture in vitro. HUVECs were grown to nearconfluence, starved for 4 h in the absence of FBS and then incubated for
48 h in the presence of CD, thrombin, or CD antibody or irrelevant IgG
(2 Ag/mL). Growth was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay with a Cell Proliferation Kit supplied by
Roche Diagnostic Corp.
Chemotaxis assay. Transwell plates (obtained from Costar 3422;
Corning. Inc.) were used to measure tumor chemotaxis. HUVEC or tumor
cells were grown to 75% confluence in 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA)–
DMEM culture media for 24 h, followed by 0.1% BSA-DMEM for an
additional 4 or 24 h, respectively. Cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS,
resuspended in 0.1% BSA-DMEM, and 200 AL (5  104 cells) were then
added to the upper chamber. The lower chamber contained 0.1 units/mL of
thrombin or 2 ng of CD in 600 AL of 0.1% BSA-DMEM. Plates were
incubated at 37jC, 5% CO2 for 3 h. Inserts were removed, washed with PBS,
and then stained with crystal violet for 10 min. Cells and solution were
removed from the inside of the insert. Excess stain was removed from the
bottom of the insert by swabbing with a cotton-tipped applicator and then
allowed to dry. Destaining was performed in 10% acetic acid for 10 min.
The solution was then transferred to a 96-well plate and absorbance read
at 595 nm.
Angiogenesis assay with CAM. Angiogenesis assays were performed as
previously described (18). Briefly, 10-day-old chick embryos were prepared
by separating the CAM from the shell membrane. Filter discs were placed
on the CAM and 25 AL of the test compound or PBS was added to the disc
at 0, 24, and 48 h. Embryos were sacrificed at 72 h and CAMs removed for
analysis. Angiogenesis was quantified by counting the number of branching
blood vessels within the confined area of the filter disc using stereomicroscopy. Each experiment was completed two or three times, with four
embryos per condition. The angiogenic index was calculated by subtracting

www.aacrjournals.org

the total number of blood vessel branch points derived from PBS-treated
control CAMs from that of the experimental group.
Matrigel endothelial tube formation was measured as described (24).
Briefly, Matrigel was added to a 96-well plate and left to polymerize for 1 h at
37jC. HUVECs (5  103) were then added in EBM-2 plus 2% FBS for 24 h at
37jC (with or without test agents). Branch points were measured by phase
microscopy in 10 random fields per well.
Gelatin zymography. Cultures of subconfluent HUVECs were starved
for 4 h in serum-free EMB-2 medium with 0.1% BSA. Cells were incubated for 24 h with various combinations of PBS, Pep A (20 Amol/L), CD
(2 ng/mL), or MMP inhibitor (MPi) GM 6001 (20 Amol/L). The conditioned
medium was removed and concentrated 10-fold. Fifty micrograms of
protein were electrophoresed in 10% SDS-PAGE polymerized with 0.2%
gelatin. The gel was then washed thrice for 1 h with 2.5% Triton X-100 and
incubated for 16 h at 37jC in collagenase buffer containing 50 mmol/L of
Tris, 200 mmol/L of NaCl, and 10 mmol/L of CaCl2 (pH 7.5). Gelatinolytic
activity was visualized by staining with 0.5% Coomassie blue.
Knockdown of CD in B16/F10 and 4T1 cells by shRNA. CD shRNA
were introduced into the shRNA-RetroQ retrovirus (BD Biosciences,
Clontech) at the BamHI and EcoRI ligation sites according to the
manufacturer’s directions. shRNA Oligonucleotides were derived from the
murine CD sequence (NIH Gene Bank accession number NM-009983) and
synthesized following derivation from the computer program supplied by
BD Biosciences.
Forward strand sequence: 5¶ GATCCGCATGGGCTACCCTCATATCTTTCAAGAGAAGATATGAGGGTAGCCCATGCTTTTTT 3¶.
Reverse strand sequence: 5¶ AATTCAAAAAAGCATGGGCTACCCTCATATCTTCTCTTGAAAGATATGAGGGTAGCCCATGCG 3¶.
The two paired oligonucleotides were annealed to form double
strands. Verification of the inserted sequence was obtained by automated
DNA sequencing from the Core Laboratory at New York University
Medical Center. The plasmids were packaged into Phoenix Ampho cells
(BD Biosciences) by standard calcium phosphate transfection. Virus
supernatants were collected at 48 h posttransfection, centrifuged to
remove nonadherent cells and cellular debris, and frozen in small aliquots
at 80jC. B16F10 or 4T1 cells were seeded at 20,000 cells per well in 24well plates. The following day, the culture medium was aspirated and
replaced with retroviral supernatant–diluted 1:2 DMEM into a final
volume of 1 mL in growth medium (DMEM) plus 10% FBS and penicillinstreptomycin. Polybrene was added to a final concentration of 4 Ag/mL.
Twenty-four hours after infection, the cells were collected by trypsinization and reseeded in six-well dishes in selective medium + 1 Ag/mL of
puromycin. Single-cell colonies were picked and reseeded with selective
medium.
Traditional reverse transcription-PCR and real-time quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR were performed to validate the knock down of CD mRNA
as well as to measure the effect of thrombin on CD-KD 4T1 cells. iCycle iQ
real-time PCR (iScript one-step RT-PCR with SYBR Green) was purchased
from Bio-Rad and performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. HUVEC were starved for
4 h, medium was removed and then replaced with the additional 5% BSA
plus agonist studied. Tumor cells were starved overnight and agonist added
for an additional 24 h. Total cell extracts were prepared after the removal of
medium, and after lysing cells in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100,
150 mmol/L of NaCl, 5 mmol/L of EDTA, 1 mmol/L of EGTA, 2.5 mmol/L of
sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmol/L of h-glycerol phosphate, 50 mmol/L of
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1 mmol/L of Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L of DTT,
1 mmol/L of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 Ag/mL of leupeptin. After
centrifugation, the supernatants (1 mg/mL) were incubated with 3 AL of
antibody (200 Ag/mL) overnight at 4jC followed by the addition of 30 AL of
protein A/G beads (0.5 mL/mL; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and further
incubated at 4jC for 2 h followed by centrifugation. The immune complexes
(beads) were washed thrice with lysis buffer and then suspended in 50 AL of
SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The washed, suspended beads were boiled at
95jC for 5 min, chilled at 4jC, and centrifuged. Thirty microliters of the

supernatant was then run on 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were incubated with
the appropriate antibody (1 Ag/mL) for 1 h at room temperature, washed
and incubated with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody
for another hour, and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence
(Amersham Biosciences).
Immunoassay for CD. Cells were serum-starved for 4 h prior to
treatment with thrombin for 4 h, and conditioned media were collected and
tested for CD by an ELISA kit from Calbiochem/EMD Chemicals.
In vivo studies in mice. A preliminary experimental pulmonary
metastasis approach was performed with B16F10 CD-KD cells (1  106)
injected into the tail vein of syngeneic C57BL/6 mice to test the feasibility of
an in vivo CD-KD approach. Animals were sacrificed on day 21 and their
lungs examined for tumor nodules.

4T1 CD-KD cells were then used because they induce a more physiologic
spontaneous metastasis in syngeneic mice, permitting measurements of cell
seeding and metastasis without the need to sacrifice animals because of
enhanced tumor burden. 4T1 green fluorescent protein (GFP)–labeled cells
were prepared as described (19). These cells were infected with shRNA CD
retrovirus or EV cells. CD-KD GFP cells (1  105) or EV GFP cells were
injected s.c. into BALB/c mice as described previously (19). Both groups
were also treated with and without hirudin, 10 mg/kg i.p, every day for
10 days followed by treatment every other day for 7 days. Day 1 injection
was given 5 min before and 4 h after tumor inoculation. The dose and
frequency was optimally determined in a previous study (19). Animals were
sacrificed on day 30 and their spontaneous pulmonary metastasis evaluated
as described (19). Tumor detection in the blood was determined by flow
cytometry of GFP-labeled 4T1 cells on day 24 as previously described (19).

Results
Thrombin up-regulates CD mRNA. To verify the results of our
Affymetrix gene chip display as well as the general biological
response to thrombin, we examined the effect of thrombin
(0.5 units/mL for 24 hours) on CD mRNA up-regulation in six
different cell lines (human MCF7 and MD-MB-231 mammary
carcinomas, PC3 prostate carcinoma, primary HUVECs as well as
murine B16F10 melanoma, and 4T1 mammary cell lines). mRNA
increased 1.5- to 2.1-fold in all six cell lines examined as determined by real-time PCR (Fig. 1A).
Thrombin up-regulates CD protein synthesis and secretion.
We next examined the effect of thrombin on intracellular protein levels (Fig. 1B) under similar conditions. The same cell lines,
as well as two additional cell lines, human THP1 (macrophage)
and murine UMCL (undifferentiated murine cell line), were used.
Protein increased 1.8- to 4.2-fold.
We also examined the effect of the PAR-1 thrombin receptor
activation peptide as well as thrombin in the same cell lines as well
as in two additional cell lines, human HeLa cervical carcinoma and
BMEC (brain microvascular endothelial cells). Figure 1C reveals
that both thrombin and thrombin receptor activation peptides
increased the secretion of CD by 3.1- to 8.2-fold compared with
control buffer, as measured by immunoblots. Similar increases
were noted with MCF7, HeLa, and PC3 cells when measured by
ELISA (P < 0.01; Fig. 1D). Thus, tumor cells secrete CD.
Requirement of CD for thrombin-induced chemotaxis of
4T1 mammary tumor cells. In order to study the effect of CD on
spontaneous tumor metastasis of 4T1 cells, we knocked down
CD with CD-shRNA using an shRNA-Retro Q viral vector.
Figure 2A shows the successful knockdown clone for 4T1 cells.

We first examined whether thrombin could induce the chemotaxis of 4T1 cells. Figure 2B shows that this was the case, and
that this was dependent on the presence of CD in 4T1 cells because
CD-KD 4T1 cells were not stimulated to migrate with thrombin
stimulation (P < 0.006, n = 3). Similar results were noted with FBS
as a stimulant (data not shown).
CD induces angiogenesis in the CAM assay. We have successfully used the chick CAM system to measure increased angiogenesis induced by thrombin (18). We therefore used the same
system to test the effect of CD on this process. Figure 3A depicts
the effect of conditioned media from wild-type, EV, scrambled
vector (SV), or CD-KD on angiogenesis at 72 hours. Blood vessel
density significantly increased with conditioned media (46 F 4)
compared with PBS treatment (22 F 2, P = 0.03; Fig. 3B). However, blood vessel density significantly decreased with CD-KD
medium (19 F 2.8) versus wild-type (46 F 4.4), EV (49 F 4.5), and
SV (45 F 2.1; P = 0.03, n = 3; Fig. 3A). We also tested the effect
of anti-CD versus control IgG on conditioned medium. Anti-CD
inhibited wild-type conditioned medium by f2-fold (31.3 F 1.5
versus 63.7 F 2.6, respectively; n = 3, P = 0.001). CD-KD medium
was 28.7 F 3.3 (P = 0.001). Thus, tumor-secreted CD contributes
to angiogenesis. To confirm this conclusion, we next tested
the effect of purified CD applied directly to the CAM. Figure 3B
shows enhanced cathepsin-induced angiogenesis compared with
buffer (PBS); 47 F 5 versus 22 F 2, respectively (P = 0.005,
n = 6). This requires proteolytically active CD because it was
blocked by the selective CD inhibitor, Pep A, an inhibitor of acid
aspartyl proteases.
Endothelial cell growth. Because endothelial cells are necessary for angiogenesis, and thrombin enhances HUVEC growth by
f2-fold in culture (24), as well as enhancing CD production,
we determined whether CD has a direct effect. Such proved to be
the case (Fig. 3C). CD-KD decreased HUVEC growth by 1.8-fold
(EV versus KD; P < 0.02, n = 3).

Endothelial cell chemotaxis. An early step in angiogenesis is
the migration of endothelial cells within the subendothelial matrix.
We therefore examined HUVEC chemotaxis. Figure 3D shows a
2.3-fold increase in HUVEC chemotaxis elicited by proteolytically
active pure CD (Pep A inhibition) as well as VEGF (positive
control), (CD versus Pep A + CD; P = 0.02, n = 4). Figure 3D is a
photomicrograph of the migrated HUVEC on the underside of the

Figure 3E shows a 1.5-fold increase with CD (P = 0.03; compared
with 1.8-fold VEGF effect) which was inhibited by Pep A (P = 0.001,

Activation of MMP-9 in HUVEC. Because CD protease activity
is required for the positive effect of CD on angiogenesis, we
hypothesized that it may be activating MMPs which facilitate
endothelial cell migration. We therefore applied pure CD directly
to the CAM which enhanced angiogenesis f2-fold. We then used
the generic MPi GM6001 in the CAM assay stimulated by CD.
Figure 4A shows inhibition by both Pep A as well as MPi (P = 0.03,

n = 3). To confirm that MPi inhibited the enhanced angiogenesis
induced by CD, we examined its effect in HUVECs by measuring
the proteolytic activity of MMPs with zymography. Figure 4B shows
enhanced levels of inactive and active MMP-9, which is inhibited
by MPi as well as Pep A. Thus, CD activates MMP-9 in HUVEC.
Effect of CD-KD on in vivo tumor growth and metastasis.
This encouraged us to study the effect of CD-KD as well as the
requirement of thrombin for spontaneous 4T1 growth, seeding, and
metastasis. A preliminary experimental pulmonary metastasis
study was first performed with B16F10 cells to test the feasibility
of an in vivo effect with CD-KD cells. CD-KD inhibited metastasis
(data not shown). We therefore used a more pathophysiologic
model in which tumor implantation lead to tumor seeding into the
blood and spontaneous metastasis (rather than tail vein injection
of a huge tumor burden). This can be performed with 4T1 syngeneic mammary carcinoma cells which have these properties (19).
Figure 5 shows the exquisite requirement of CD for tumor growth
following injection of 4T1 tumor into the flank of C57BL/6 mice.
Tumor growth was inhibited 3- to 4-fold on days 10 and 15, and
by 6.1-fold on day 28 compared with EV cells (P < 0.01, n = 8).
The effect of the simultaneous addition of hirudin, a specific
thrombin inhibitor, was examined to test the contribution of
thrombin to this process. Note that hirudin also significantly
inhibited tumor growth of wild-type EV 4T1 cells (P < 0.01, as

without 10 mg/kg of hirudin (H ) for 10 d followed by treatment every other
day for 7 d (n = 8). Bars, SE.

previously reported; ref. 19), but not to the same extent as CD-KD.
The CD-KD cells had f2-fold less tumor growth than hirudintreated animals. This would suggest that CD up-regulation by
thrombin contributed to tumor growth, but that CD may also have
an effect independent of thrombin.
Effect of CD-KD and hirudin on 4T1 tumor, seeding, and
spontaneous metastasis. GFP-labeled 4T1 tumor cells have the
capacity to spontaneously metastasize to the lung. Therefore,
seeding into the blood as well as pulmonary metastasis could be
quantitated. Tumor seeding into the blood was decreased by
6.2-fold in CD-KD 4T1 cells compared with EV wild-type cells on
days 23 to 30, with a mean of 31 cells versus 5 cells (n = 2). No
significant differences were noted on days 0 to 15. These
differences were supported by the effect of CD on spontaneous
tumor metastasis in which CD-KD cells had 4-fold less metastasis
(n = 5, P < 0.02). Hirudin treatment also decreased spontaneous
metastasis by 4.6-fold (P < 0.01; Table 1).

These data clearly show a general up-regulation of CD mRNA,
protein, and protein secretion by thrombin in eight different
tumor cell lines tested, as well as in HUVEC. This observation,
as well as the recognition that CD up-regulation is associated
with human tumor malignancy, poor prognosis, and increased
risk of relapse and metastasis, strongly supports the evidence
that thrombin up-regulation of CD contributes to the malignant
tumor phenotype.
The mechanism of how a lysosomal, acidic pH-optimum CD
contributes to malignancy is not clearly understood. Conflicting
and puzzling studies have been published. It has been reported that
CD supports breast tumor metastasis by a mechanism unrelated
to its proteolytic activity, and that CD both enhances and inhibits
the apoptosis of tumor cells. CD correlates weakly with in vivo
tumor angiogenesis in association with its up-regulation of angiogenesis inhibitors, angiostatin, and 16K-like prolactin fragments
(36, 45). The weak correlation of CD with angiogenesis could not

NOTE: 4T1 cells (1  105) were injected into the flank of syngeneic BALB/c mice and pulmonary nodules enumerated at day 30 following animal
sacrifice. Two-tailed t tests revealed statistically significant P values for EV vs. CD-KD (0.018), EV vs. EV + hirudin (0.01), and EV vs. CD-KD + hirudin

be ruled out on the basis of increased tumor size (46). It has also
been reported that CD releases basic fibroblast growth factor
from heparin sulfate sites in the extracellular matrix (47).
Perhaps the best evidence for CD being a stimulator of tumor
growth rather than an associative finding comes from studies
performed with transgenically elevated CD (both proteolytically
active or inactive) in 3Y1-Ad12 rat tumor xenografts injected s.c.
into athymic mice (48), as well as from studies with antisense CD
in MDA-MB-231 mammary tumor cells similarly injected into nude
mice (49). Transfected rat tumors had an enhanced tumor surface
area, proliferating cell nuclear antigens, and apparent enhanced
angiogenesis with proteolytically inactive as well as active CD.
In addition, apoptosis was only noted in proteolytically active
transgenics. Antisense CD MDA-MB-231 cells showed decreased
experimental pulmonary metastasis.
Our data extend these observations by using a more relevant
syngeneic mouse model in which tumor seeding as well as
spontaneous tumor metastasis were measured with a 4T1 tumor
short hairpin knockdown system. In our system, surface tumor size
differences were noted between wild-type and CD-KD tumor
models. However, unlike other studies, we also measured tumor
seeding and more physiologically relevant spontaneous pulmonary
metastasis. Both were decreased in CD-KD mice. Indeed, in
support of our hypothesis, we also showed that CD was required
for thrombin-induced tumor chemotaxis.
We next examined the possible direct effect of CD on angiogenesis. We found that proteolytically active CD directly stimulated
angiogenesis in the CAM model and that angiogenesis could be
specifically inhibited with anti-CD antibody as well as with CD-KD
conditioned medium. An explanation for the mechanism behind

CD-induced angiogenesis revealed increased endothelial cell growth,
chemotaxis, Matrigel tube formation, and activation of MMP-9.
We took our observations one step further by comparing the
effect of CD-KD with hirudin-treated mice in which thrombin is
inactive. Both the hirudin-treated wild-type mouse model as well
as the CD-KD mouse model gave similar reduced surface tumor
size, spontaneous blood seeding of tumor, and spontaneous metastasis. These observations support the concept that CD in tumor
is regulated by thrombin activity, and that patients with higher
CD tumor content and poor prognosis are likely to have higher
tumor burden and thrombin activity. This is supported by older
observations on tumor burden and hypercoagulativity in which
it was shown that low-grade intravascular coagulation with the
generation of thrombin had been observed in most patients with
solid tumors (3, 50–52), as well as in 60% of patients with cancer
at the time of diagnosis. It progresses with greater tumor burden,
and is associated with a poor prognosis (52).
