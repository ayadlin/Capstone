Abstract
Fibroblast growth factor-8b (FGF8b) affects the epithelial/stromal compartments
of steroid hormone-regulated tumors by exerting an autocrine activity on cancer cells
and a paracrine pro-angiogenic function, thus contributing to tumor progression. The
FGF8b/FGF receptor (FGFR) system may therefore represent a target for the treatment
of steroid hormone-regulated tumors. The soluble pattern recognition receptor long
pentraxin-3 (PTX3) binds various FGFs, including FGF2 and FGF8b, thus inhibiting the
angiogenic and tumorigenic activity of androgen-regulated tumor cells. Nevertheless,
the complex/proteinaceous structure of PTX3 hampers its pharmacological
exploitation. In this context, the acetylated pentapeptide Ac-ARPCA-NH2 (ARPCA),
corresponding to the N-terminal amino acid sequence PTX3(100-104), was identified
as a minimal FGF2-binding peptide able to antagonize the biological activity of
FGF2. Here, we demonstrate that ARPCA binds FGF8b and inhibits its capacity to
form FGFR1-mediated ternary complexes with heparan sulphate proteoglycans. As
a FGF8b antagonist, ARPCA inhibits FGFR1 activation and signalling in endothelial
cells, hampering the angiogenic activity exerted in vitro and in vivo by FGF8b. Also,
ARPCA suppresses the angiogenic and tumorigenic potential of prototypic androgen/
FGF8b-dependent Shionogi 115 mammary carcinoma cells and of androgen/FGF8b/
FGF2-dependent TRAMP-C2 prostate cancer cells. In conclusion, ARPCA represents
a novel FGF8b antagonist with translational implications for the therapy of steroid
hormone-regulated tumors.

INTRODUCTION

responsible for its transcriptional activation by steroidreceptor signalling [6]. Alternatively spliced isoforms
of the human FGF8 gene allow the transcription of four
different isoforms designated FGF8a, FGF8b, FGF8e,
and FGF8f [7]. Among them, FGF8b is endowed with
the strongest tumorigenic and angiogenic potential [4,
8]. Indeed, several studies demonstrate that FGF8b
triggers angiogenesis, tumor growth and invasion in
prostate cancer [5, 9]. Accordingly, FGF8b transgenic
expression targeted to the prostate epithelium causes
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) [10] whereas
its downregulation inhibits the tumorigenic potential of

Fibroblast growth factor-8 (FGF8), originally
cloned from an androgen-dependent mouse mammary
carcinoma cell line, belongs to the angiogenic FGF family
[1, 2]. Like other members of the FGF family, FGF8
mediates its cellular responses by binding and activating
tyrosine kinase FGF receptors (FGFRs) [3]. Experimental
and clinical evidences point to an autocrine/paracrine
role of FGF8 in the growth of epithelial/stromal cells
in steroid hormone-regulated tumors [4, 5], the FGF8

acid residue for FGF8b interaction, a series of synthetic
peptides harboring different amino acid substitutions were
assessed for their FGF8b binding activity by SPR analysis
on the FGF8b-coated sensor chip.
As shown in Figure 1B, the partially scrambled
Ac-APCRA-NH2 peptide did not show any significant
inhibitory activity in this assay, pointing to the relevance
of the relative position of RPC residues for the FGF8b
antagonist capacity of the peptide. The activity was lost
also when the Pro3 residue was replaced in Ac-ARACANH2 and Ac-ARGCA-NH2 peptides or when the Cys4
residue was replaced in Ac-ARPSA-NH2, Ac-ARPMANH2, and Ac-ARPVA-NH2 peptides, thus underlying
the role of the RPC amino acid sequence in ARPCA/
FGF8b interaction. Interestingly, as observed for ARPCA/
FGF2 interaction [20], the FGF8b binding activity was
dramatically reduced for the non-acetylated H-ARPCANH2 peptide and for the Ac-ARPCG-NH2 and Ac-GRPCGNH2 peptides, indicating a role for the N-terminal blocking
methyl group and for the methyl group of the side-chain of
Ala1 and Ala5 residues in FGF8b interaction.
In order to characterize the structural basis of
ARPCA/FGF8b binding interactions, FGF8b was titrated
into a solution of ARPCA peptide and a series of 2D 13C-1H
HSQC NMR experiments were recorded to follow peptide
resonances. Progressive chemical shift variations were
observed for Hα signals of Ala1 and Ala5 residues of the
pentapeptide (Figure 1C), indicating that ARPCA makes
specific interactions with FGF8b, mainly mediated by the
two Ala residues. The titration progress was indicative of
an intermediate to fast exchange phenomenon, pointing
to a binding in the micromolar range, in good agreement
with SPR data. Taken together, these results identify
the ARPCA pentapeptide as a FGF8b binder. On this
basis, ARPCA was further characterized for its capacity
to interact with FGF8b and to antagonize its biological
activity. The Ac-ARPVA-NH2 pentapeptide (hereafter
named ARPVA) was used as a negative control.
FGFs exert their biological activity by leading
to the formation of productive ternary complexes with
signalling FGFRs and cell-surface heparan sulphate
proteoglycans (HSPGs) [23]. On this basis, to investigate
its FGF8b antagonist potential, ARPCA was evaluated for
the capacity to prevent the formation of HSPG/FGF8b/
FGFR1 ternary complexes in a cell-cell adhesion model
in which FGF8b mediates the adhesion of FGFR1(III)
c-overexpressing HSPG-deficient CHO cells to a HSPGbearing CHO cell monolayer [16]. As shown in Figure
1D, ARPCA, but not ARPVA, exerts a dose-dependent
inhibitory activity on FGF8b-mediated cell-cell adhesion
(ID50 ~10 µM), thus indicating the capacity of the
peptide to interfere with HSPG/FGF8b/FGFR1 complex
formation.

prostate cancer cells [11]. Also, FGF8b was found to be
highly expressed in breast and ovarian cancers [4, 8].
Thus FGF8b represents a possible druggable target for
multidrug or multimodality treatment of steroid hormoneregulated tumors [4, 6].
The soluble pattern recognition receptor long
pentraxin-3 (PTX3) is a member of the pentraxin family
produced locally in response to inflammatory signals [12].
Previous observations had shown that PTX3 binds various
FGFs via its N-terminal extension, including FGF2, FGF6,
FGF8b, FGF10 and FGF17 [13-16], and inhibits FGF2dependent angiogenic responses [16, 17]. Accordingly,
transgenic PTX3 overexpression efficaciously impairs the
activation and signaling of the FGF/FGFR system in FGFdriven tumor cell lines, thus affecting tumor growth and
metastasis [15, 16, 18]. In particular, PTX3 inhibits the
angiogenic and tumorigenic activity of androgen-regulated
tumor cells in which testosterone activates a FGF8bdependent autocrine/paracrine loop of stimulation [15].
PTX3 is a 340 kDa protein composed of eight 381
amino acid protomers [19]. The complex proteinaceous
structure of PTX3 hampers its pharmacological
exploitation. In this context, the 480 Da acetylated
pentapeptide Ac-ARPCA-NH2 (in single letter code,
hereafter referred to as ARPCA), corresponding to the
N-terminal amino acid sequence PTX3(100-104), was
identified as a minimal anti-angiogenic FGF2-binding
peptide able to interfere with the biological activity of
FGF2 [20]. Thus, ARPCA may represent an interesting
FGF-trap molecule for the treatment of FGF-dependent
tumors.
Here, we demonstrate the capacity of ARPCA
to bind FGF8b, thus inhibiting its angiogenic activity
in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, ARPCA suppresses
the angiogenic and tumorigenic potential of prototypic
androgen/FGF8b-dependent Shionogi 115 (S115)
mammary carcinoma cells [21] and of androgen/FGF8b/
FGF2-dependent TRAMP-C2 prostate cancer cells [22].
Thus, ARPCA represents a novel FGF8b antagonist with
possible implications for the therapy of steroid hormoneregulated tumors.

RESULTS
ARPCA binds and antagonizes FGF8b
The capacity of ARPCA to bind FGF8b was assessed
by surface plasmonic resonance (SPR) spectroscopy
[20]. To this purpose, increasing concentrations of the
peptide were injected over a BIAcore sensor chip coated
with the immobilized growth factor. As shown in Figure
1A, ARPCA binds to immobilized FGF8b in a dosedependent manner with a Kd value equal to 278 ± 120 µM.

on the angiogenic potential of vascular endothelial growth
factor-A (VEGF-A), thus supporting the FGF-restricted
specificity of the inhibitory effect (Figure 2C).
Finally, the capacity of ARPCA to affect FGF8binduced neovascularization was investigated in vivo in
a chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay
[24]. In this assay, alginate beads adsorbed with FGF8b
(4.5 pmoles/plug) induce a potent angiogenic response
when compared to control beads adsorbed with vehicle
(Figure 2D). In keeping with the in vitro observations, the
angiogenic response elicited by FGF8b was significantly
reduced by the addition of 80 or 140 pmoles of ARPCA to
the FGF8b implants (P < 0.0001). No inhibitory effect was
instead exerted by control ARPVA or when ARPCA was
challenged in the presence of VEGF-A as a pro-angiogenic
stimulus (Figure 2D).

FGF8 acts on endothelial cells leading to the
activation of the angiogenic process in vitro and in vivo
[21]. In a first set of experiments, the capacity of ARPCA
to impair the pro-angiogenic activity of FGF8b was
assessed in vitro on human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs). In keeping with its capacity to prevent the
formation of signaling HSPG/FGF8b/FGFR complexes,
ARPCA, but not ARPVA, efficiently impairs FGFR1
phosphorylation triggered by FGF8b in HUVECs (Figure
2A). Accordingly, ARPCA inhibits HUVEC proliferation
in response to FGF8b with an IC50 value equal to ~30 µM
whereas no significant effect was observed when cells
were treated with ARPVA at concentrations as high as 300
µM (Figure 2B). Also, ARPCA specifically prevents the
pro-angiogenic/sprouting activity exerted by FGF8b on
HUVEC spheroids embedded in fibrin gel with no effect

ARPCA inhibits the proliferation and angiogenic
potential of FGF8b-dependent tumor cells

shown in Figure 3C, DHT-pretreated cells elicited a potent
neovascular response that was abolished when cells were
grafted in the presence of ARPCA at 80 or 140 pmoles/
embryo (P < 0.001), no effect being exerted by control
ARPVA. Together, these data indicate that ARPCA impairs
the FGF8b-dependent mitogenic and angiogenic response
triggered by DHT/FGF8b in S115 cells.

Shionogi-115 (S115) cells represent a wellcharacterized murine model of androgen-regulated
mammary tumor in which testosterone induces FGF8b
upregulation that, in turn, increases FGFR1 expression,
thus activating an autocrine loop of stimulation [16, 21].
As shown in Figure 3A, ARPCA impairs the mitogenic
response of S115 cells to FGF8b or dihydrotestosterone
(DHT) whereas ARPVA was ineffective. Accordingly,
ARPCA, but not ARPVA, inhibits FGFR1 phosphorylation
and downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) ERK1/2 activation in S115 cells treated with
FGF8b (Figure 3B).
FGF8b produced by steroid hormone-regulated
cancers promotes angiogenesis that sustains tumor
growth in vivo [21]. To assess the effect of ARPCA on
the angiogenic potential of FGF8b-producing tumor
cells, S115 cells were incubated for 24 h with 10 nM
DHT and then grafted onto the chick embryo CAM. As

In order to assess the effect of ARPCA on the early
phases of growth of FGF8b-dependent tumor grafts, S115
cells encapsulated in sodium alginate gel were injected
s.c. in the flank of adult athymic Nu/Nu male mice. Then,
mice were treated i.p. with 100 mg/kg of ARPCA or
ARPVA on days 9, 11 and 13 after tumor challenge. On

activates a FGF8b-dependent autocrine/paracrine loop
of stimulation [15]. PTX3 interacts with different ligands
via its N-terminal or C-terminal domain [12, 17]. An
integrated approach that utilized recombinant N-terminal
and C-terminal PTX3 fragments, monoclonal antibodies,
and SPR analysis identified the FGF2-binding domain
in the PTX3 N-terminus [14]. Moreover, as observed
for FGF2 [13, 14], a free recombinant N-terminal PTX3
fragment prevented the binding of FGF8b to immobilized
PTX3 [16], thus implicating the N-terminal PTX3
extension also in this interaction.
Here, we demonstrate that the pentapeptide ARPCA,
corresponding to the amino acid sequence 100-104 in
PTX3 N-terminus, represents a novel FGF8b antagonist
endowed with antiangiogenic and antineoplastic activity.
Indeed, ARPCA binds FGF8b, thus preventing the
formation of signalling HSPG/FGF8b/FGFR1 ternary
complexes. Accordingly, ARPCA inhibits the angiogenic
activity exerted in vitro and in vivo by FGF8b. Also,
ARPCA inhibits the proliferation and angiogenic potential
of androgen-regulated murine mammary S115 tumor
cells driven by FGF8b as well as by testosterone. As a
result of its ability to inhibit both paracrine and autocrine
functions of FGF8b, ARPCA exerts a significant inhibitory
effect on FGFR1 phosphorylation, cell proliferation,
angiogenic and tumorigenic activity of S115 tumor
grafts in immunodeficient male mice. Furthermore,
ARPCA inhibits the FGF8b/FGF2-driven growth and
vascularization of TRAMP-C2 tumors, an androgenresponsive murine model of prostate carcinoma [22].
Notably, the anti-tumor action of ARPCA occurred
in the absence of any systemic toxic effect in treated
animals. In particular, at variance with other inhibitors of
the FGF/FGFR system [30], the safety profile of ARPCA
treatment included the absence of any effect on the blood
levels of FGF23, calcium and phosphorus. Accordingly,
SPR analysis did not show any interaction of ARPCA with
immobilized FGF23 (data not shown).
VEGF plays a central role in tumor
neovascularization and inhibition of the VEGF/VEGF
receptor system markedly disrupts angiogenic switching
and initial tumor growth. However, targeting FGFs in
addition to VEGF might show synergistic effects in the
treatment of angiogenesis-dependent diseases, including
cancer [1, 31]. Also, experimental evidences indicate that
drug resistance to VEGF blockade may occur following
reactivation of the angiogenic process triggered by the
compensatory upregulation of the FGF/FGFR system in
experimental tumor models [32] and in cancer patients
[33], representing a mechanism of escape to antiVEGF therapy in cancer treatment [31]. Our preclinical
observations support the notion that inhibition of FGF8b
activity by ARPCA suppresses the initial phases of growth
and vascularization of androgen-regulated tumors, thus
resulting in the inhibition of tumor progression in longterm tumor assays. This occurs despite the fact that

proliferation index and CD31+ neovascularization in tumor
grafts when compared to lesions harvested from ARPVAtreated animals, thus confirming the inhibitory effect
of ARPCA on in vivo S115 cell growth and angiogenic
potential. On this basis, we performed a long-term
experiment in which Nu/Nu male mice were injected s.c.
with S115 cells and treated i.p. every other day with 100
mg/kg of ARPCA starting at day 8, when tumors were
palpable. Tumor growth was followed for the next 32 days
when tumors were harvested and weighted. The results
demonstrate that ARPCA, but not ARPVA, suppresses
S115 tumor growth (Figure 4B).
Previous observations had shown that FGF8b and
FGF2 play a key role in prostate cancer and that PTX3
overexpression inhibits the FGF8b/FGF2-driven growth
of TRAMP-C2 tumors [15], an androgen-responsive
murine model of prostate carcinoma [22]. Given the
capacity of ARPCA to act as a FGF2/FGF8b-trap ( [20]
and present work), we assessed its therapeutic potential
also in this steroid-regulated tumor model driven by the
autocrine/paracrine action of both FGFs. To this purpose,
TRAMP-C2 cells were embedded in alginate plugs
and injected s.c. in syngeneic C57BL/6 male mice. As
observed for early S115 lesions, treatment with ARPCA
(i.p. at 100 mg/kg every other day) impaired FGFR1
activation in TRAMP-C2 alginate plugs, thus leading to
a decrease of the tumor cell proliferation rate (as assessed
by Ki67 immunostaining) and of CD31-positive tumor
vascularization (Figure 5A). Accordingly, ARPCA, but
not ARPVA, inhibited the growth of TRAMP-C2 tumor
grafts in a long-term assay (Figure 5B). Of note, longterm administration of ARPCA did not affect body weight,
hematologic parameters, blood serum components and
FGF23 serum levels in treated animals (Figure 6).

DISCUSSION
FGF8b affects epithelial/stromal compartments of
steroid hormone-regulated tumors by exerting an autocrine
activity on cancer cells and a paracrine pro-angiogenic
function that may contribute to tumor progression [4-6,
8]. Indeed, FGF8b is overexpressed in a high proportion
of human breast [25] and aggressive prostate cancers [26].
Also, FGF8b plays a non-redundant role in the activation
of FGFR signaling cascade that confers resistance to
hormone deprivation therapy and drives the progression
toward a hormone-independent neoplasm [27]. On this
basis, the FGF/FGFR system has been hypothesized as
a target for the treatment of steroid hormone-regulated
tumors [4, 27, 28], also in a possible synergistic
combination with radiotherapy or classical chemotherapy
[29].
Previous observations had shown that the soluble
pattern recognition receptor PTX3 binds FGF8b and
inhibits the angiogenic and tumorigenic activity of
androgen-regulated tumor cells in which testosterone

Hydrophobic interactions are implicated in
ARPCA binding to FGF8b. X-ray crystallography data
have shown that hydrophobic interactions dominate the
interface between FGFs and the D2 domain of the FGFR
extracellular moiety [34, 35]. On this basis, ARPCA
likely exerts its FGF antagonist activity by mimicking the
hydrophobic region of D2, thus competing with FGFRs
for the binding to the growth factor, as hypothesized for
ARPCA/FGF2 interaction [20]. Indeed, ARPCA hampers
the capacity of FGF8b to form FGFR1-mediated ternary
complexes with HSPGs, thus inhibiting FGFR1 activation
and signalling triggered by FGF8b in endothelial and
cancer cells. It must be pointed out that the unique
spatial positioning of the FGF8b N-terminal g-helix
allows for a hydrophobic contact also with the groove in
the FGFR D3 domain [35], thus representing a possible
alternative/additional ARPCA interaction site for FGF8b
(Supplemental Figure S1). Further studies will be required
to unambiguously define the molecular bases of ARPCA/
FGF8b interaction.
Previous findings had shown that ARPCA is
endowed with a potent anti-FGF2 activity in vitro and
in vivo [20]. Here, we demonstrate the ability of ARPCA
to antagonize also the pro-angiogenic and tumorigenic
activity of FGF8b. Accordingly, ARPCA exerts a
significant inhibitory on the growth and vascularization
of TRAMP-C2 tumor grafts, a classical model of steroid
hormone-dependent prostate cancer characterized by
FGF2/FGF8b co-expression. Thus, ARPCA may act as
a FGF2/FGF8b antagonist able to affect tumor epithelial
and stromal compartments by suppressing the autocrine/
paracrine action of both growth factors. Relevant to this
point, SPR experiments indicate that ARPCA is able
to interact also with other members of the FGF family,
including FGF1, FGF5, FGF7, FGF16, FGF17, FGF18,
FGF20 and FGF22 (Table 1). All these FGFs have been
shown to play a role in different human cancers [36-42].
Experiments are in progress to translate the information
about ARPCA/FGF interaction into a pharmacophore
model to be used for the screening of small molecule
databases [43], in the search for a novel low molecular
weight multi-FGF trap for the therapy of FGF-driven
cancers.

Table 1: Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis
of FGF/ARPCA interaction. The capacity of increasing
concentrations of ARPCA (ranging between 8 µM
and 2000 µM) to bind canonical and hormonal FGFs
immobilized to Biacore sensor chips was assessed by SPR
analysis. Then, equilibrium (plateau) values of the SPR
sensorgrams were used to build the binding isotherms that
were fitted with the Langmuir equation for monovalent
binding. This allowed to evaluate the mass surface

ARPCA does not affect the pro-angiogenic action of
VEGF-A and may be related to its ability to affect both
tumor epithelial and stromal compartments by suppressing
the autocrine/paracrine action of FGF8b that is essential
for the initial angiogenic and proliferative switch of tumor
cells.
Various amino acid substitutions in the ARPCA
sequence, including the removal of the N-terminal
blocking acetyl group, cause a dramatic decrease in the
FGF8b-binding capacity of the corresponding mutated
synthetic pentapeptides, pointing to the relevance of each
amino acid residue for ARPCA/FGF8b interaction. NMR
experiments demonstrate that Ala1 and Ala5 make direct
contacts with the FGF8b protein and the involvement of
their methyl groups in FGF8b interaction is supported
by the observed lack of activity of the Ac-GRPCG-NH2
mutant. On the other hand, the RPC sequence plays a
conformational role in ARPCA/FGF8b interaction and
may help to orient the methyl groups of the peptide for
optimal interaction with the growth factor. This hypothesis
is supported by the lack of FGF8b-binding activity of Pro3
or Cys4 peptide mutants and of the partially scrambled
Ac-APCRA-NH2 peptide.

were dissolved in 10mM sodium acetate at optimal pH,
immobilized on CM5 sensorchips and tested for their
capacity to bind ARPCA as described above.

HUVECs were used at passages I–IV and grown
on plastic surface coated with porcine gelatin (SigmaAldrich) in M199 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
(Invitrogen), endothelial cell growth factor (100 µg/mL)
(Sigma-Aldrich), and porcine heparin (100 µg/mL, SigmaAldrich). S115 mouse mammary carcinoma cells were
kindly provided by M. Jalkanen (Biotie, Turku, Finland)
and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% heatinactivated FBS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1 mM glutamine
and 10 mM testosterone (DHT). Murine prostate
adenocarcinoma TRAMP-C2 cells were obtained from
ATCC repository and maintained in DMEM supplemented
with 10% heat inactivated FBS, 10 mM HEPES buffer,
0.5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.0 mM glutamine, 5 mg/ml
bovine insulin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 nM DHT. Cells
were maintained at low passage, returning to original
frozen stocks every 3 to 4 months, and tested regularly for
Mycoplasma negativity.

ARPCA-FGF8 interactions assessed by NMR
NMR experiments were collected on samples
containing 190 μM of ARPCA, dissolved in 50 mM
potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.7 (90% H2O/10% D2O),
2.5 mM arginine, 10mM NaCl in the presence of variable
concentrations of FGF8 corresponding to 1:0, 1:0.5, and
1:1 ARPCA:FGF8 ratios.
2D 1H-13C HSQC spectra were recorded with a
sweep width of 10 ppm and 100 ppm.2k x 128 data points
were used in proton and carbon dimensions, respectively.
Data, acquired and processed using Topspin (Bruker
Biospin), were apodized with a squared sinebell shifted by
90° and polynomial baseline correction. All NMR spectra
were recorded at 298 K with a Bruker DMX spectrometer
operating at 600 MHz.

Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) analyses

HSPG/FGF8b/FGFR1 mediated cell-cell adhesion
assay

A BIAcore X-100 apparatus (BIAcore Inc.,
Piscataway, NJ, USA) was used to set up the following
experimental models. ARPCA and all the peptides
mentioned in the present work were analyzed for their
capacity to directly bind to immobilized FGF8b. To this
purpose, FGF8b (20 µg/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH
6.0) was allowed to react with a flow cell of a CM5 sensor
chip that was previously activated with a mixture of 0.2
M N-ethyl-N’-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide
hydrochloride and 0.05 M N-hydroxysuccinimide (35
µl, flow rate 10 µl/min). After ligand immobilization,
matrix neutralization was performed with 1.0 M
ethanolamine (pH 8.5) (35 µl, flow rate 10 µl/min) and
the activated/deactivated dextran was used as reference
(control) system. Increasing concentrations of ARPCA
(ranging between 8 µM and 2000 µM) were injected
over the FGF8b-coated sensor chip and the response was
recorded as a function of time tracking the SPR intensity
change upon binding progression. Injection lasted for 4
min (flow rate 30 µl/min) to allow peptide association
to immobilized FGF8b and was followed by 10 min of
dissociation; each run was performed in HBS and the
sensor chip was regenerated with 10 mM NaOH. The
equilibrium (plateau) values of the SPR sensorgrams were
used to build the binding isotherms (dose-response curves)
displayed. Binding isotherm points were fitted with the
Langmuir equation for monovalent binding. This allowed
to evaluate the mass surface dissociation constant, Kd, and
the scaling parameter that relates the SPR signal with the
extent of binding, as the free parameters of the fitting. The
errors on these parameters were assigned as a result of
the fitting algorithm (95% confidence bounds). The bestfitting procedure was performed with the SigmaPlot 11.0
software package (Systat Software Inc.). Others FGFs

This assay was performed as described [44] with
minor modifications. Briefly, wild-type CHO-K1 cells
were seeded in 24-well plates at 150000 cells/cm2. After 24
h, cell monolayers were washed with PBS and incubated
with 3% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 2 h at 4°C. Fixation
was stopped with 0.1 M glycine and cells were washed
extensively with PBS. Then, A745-CHO-flg-1A-luc cells
(50000 cells/cm2) were added to CHO-K1 monolayers in
serum-free medium plus 10 mM EDTA with or without
30 ng/ml FGF8b in the absence or presence of increasing
concentrations of the ARPCA or ARPVA peptides. After
2 h of incubation at 37°C, unattached cells were removed
by washing twice with PBS, and A745-CHO-flg-1A-luc
bound to the CHO-K1 monolayer were solubilized and
luciferase activity was quantified. All experiments were
performed in triplicate.

Cell proliferation assays
HUVECs were seeded at 18000 cells/cm2 in
medium containing 2.5% FBS and stimulated with 30
ng/ml FGF8b in the absence or presence of increasing
concentrations of ARPCA or ARPVA. S115 cells were
seeded at 15000 cells/cm2 in medium containing 4%
hormone-deprived dextran-coated charcoal-stripped heat
inactivated FBS, followed by 24 h serum starvation in
1:1 mixture of serum-free Ham’s F12 and DMEM. Cells
were stimulated for 48 h with 30 ng/ml FGF8b or 10 nM
DHT in the presence or absence of different concentrations
of ARPCA or ARPVA (as specified in the corresponding

function of the MACSQuant Analyzer (Miltenyi Biotec,
Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany, EU).

Chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM)
assay

Endothelial cell sprouting assay

Alginate plugs containing vehicle, FGF8b (4.5
pmoles/embryo), VEGF-A (4.5 pmoles/embryo) or
S115 cells (2.5x104/embryo) in the absence or presence
of ARPCA (80 or 140 pmoles/embryo) or ARPVA (140
pmoles/embryo) were placed on the CAM of fertilized
white leghorn chicken eggs at day 11 of incubation. At day
14, newly formed blood microvessels converging toward
the implant were counted by two observers in a doubleblind fashion at 5x magnification under a stereomicroscope
(STEMI-SR, x2/0.12; Zeiss) as described [24].

HUVEC spheroid aggregates were prepared in 20%
methylcellulose medium, embedded in fibrin gel, and
stimulated with FGF8b or VEGF-A (both at 30 ng/ml) plus
5% FBS in the absence or presence of 60 µM ARPCA
or ARPVA. Formation of radially growing cell sprouts
was observed during the next 24 h, photographed at 200x
magnification using an Axiovert 200M microscope (Carl
Zeiss, Milan, Italy, EU) and counted.

Murine s.c. alginate implant assay

Western blotting

Eightweek-old athymic Nu/Nu or C57BL/6 male
mice were injected s.c. with 450 μl of 3% (w/v) sodium
alginate solution (alginic acid dissolved in LPS-free
PBS) containing 5x106 S115 or 8x106 TRAMP-C2
cells, respectively [15]. Mice were treated i.p. with
ARPCA or ARPVA (100 mg/kg) on day 7, 9, 11 and 13
after implant. On day 14, alginate gels were harvested,
weighted, embedded in OCT-compound and immediately
frozen to be processed for histological analysis. For
immunofluorescence stainings, sections (5 μm thick)
were obtained with a cryostat microtome, air dried and
fixed with acetone (for 5 min at 4°C). After blocking
with 1% BSA (Bovine Serum Albumin) in PBS for 10
minutes, sections were incubated with primary antibodies,
rabbit anti-FGFR1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit
anti-phospho FGFR1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Ki67
(Dako, Milano, Italy, EU) or CD31 (BD Biosciences
Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA). After washing with
PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, sections were incubated
with the appropriate Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor
594-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen). After
mounting in a drop of anti-bleaching mounting medium
containing DAPI (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA, USA), sections were examined under
a Zeiss Fluorescence Axiovert 200M microscope (Carl
Zeiss).

S115 cells were treated with FGF8b (30ng/ml) in the
presence or absence of ARPCA (100 µM) or ARPVA (100
µM). After 20 minutes of incubation cell samples were
washed in cold PBS and homogenized in RIPA buffer
containing 1% Triton-X100, 0.2% BriJ, 1 mM sodium
orthovanadate and protease inhibitors cocktail. Protein
concentrations were determined using the Bradford protein
assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milano, Italy). Blotting
analysis was performed using anti-FGFR1, anti-phospho
FGFR1 and anti-phosphoERK1/2 antibodies (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Equal loading of
the lanes was confirmed by immunoblotting with anti–
αTubulin (Sigma-Aldrich) antibody.

In vitro immunofluorescence analysis
HUVECs were seeded in Ibidi µ-Slide 8 wells
(Ibidi, Martinsried, Germany, EU) at a density of 30000
cells/cm2, starved in 2.5% FBS for 24 h and stimulated
for 20 minutes with 30 ng/ml of FGF8b in the absence
or presence of ARPCA or ARPVA. Following stimulation,
cells were washed twice in PBS, fixed in cold acetone
for 5 minutes and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X100
in PBS for 2 minutes at room temperature (RT). After
washing in PBS, cells were blocked for 10 minutes at RT
in 1% BSA and then incubated with rabbit anti-pFGFR1 or
rabbit anti-FGFR1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
for 1 h at RT. After washing in PBS, cells were incubated
with AlexaFluor 594-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody
(Invitrogen) and DAPI for 30 minutes at RT. Finally, cells
were examined under a Zeiss Fluorescence Axiovert 200M
microscope (Carl Zeiss).

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using the
statistical package Prism 5 (GraphPad Software).
Student’s t test for unpaired data (2-tailed) was used to
test the probability of significant differences between
two groups of samples. For more than two groups of
samples, data were statistically analyzed with a 1-way
analysis of variance, and individual group comparisons
were evaluated by the Bonferroni multiple comparison
test. Tumor volume data were statistically analyzed
with a 2-way analysis of variance, and individual group
comparisons were evaluated by the Bonferroni correction.
Differences were considered significant when P < 0.05.
