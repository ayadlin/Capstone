Abstract
Most anti-angiogenic therapies currently being evaluated in clinical trials target
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway, however, the tumor vasculature
can acquire resistance to VEGF-targeted therapy by shifting to other angiogenesis
mechanisms. Therefore, other potential therapeutic agents that block non-VEGF
angiogenic pathways need to be evaluated. Here we identified formononetin as a
novel agent with potential anti-angiogenic and anti-cancer activities. Formononetin
demonstrated inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube
formation in response to basic fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). In ex vivo and in vivo
angiogenesis assays, formononetin suppressed FGF2-induced microvessel sprouting
of rat aortic rings and angiogenesis. To understand the underlying molecular basis,
we examined the effects of formononetin on different molecular components in
treated endothelial cell, and found that formononetin suppressed FGF2-triggered
activation of FGFR2 and protein kinase B (Akt) signaling. Moreover, formononetin
directly inhibited proliferation and blocked the oncogenic signaling pathways in
breast cancer cell. In vivo, using xenograft models of breast cancer, formononetin
showed growth-inhibitory activity associated with inhibition of tumor angiogenesis.
Moreover, formononetin enhanced the effect of VEGFR2 inhibitor sunitinib on tumor
growth inhibition. Taken together, our results indicate that formononetin targets the
FGFR2-mediated Akt signaling pathway, leading to the suppression of tumor growth
and angiogenesis.

Introduction

factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) is the major effecter for
execution of VEGF-stimulated cell proliferation, vascular
permeability, cell migration, and cell survival, leading to
angiogenesis. Antagonizing angiogenesis-related receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK) is a promising therapeutic strategy
in oncology. A number of small molecule VEGFR2
inhibitors have been reported, including sunitinib,
sorafenib, and vandetanib [3]. However, other angiogenic
regulatory factors switch on during cancer progression

Tumor angiogenesis is essential for the development
and progression of malignant tumors [1]. Although
many putative regulators of angiogenesis have been
identified, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
has been particularly strongly implicated in tumorassociated angiogenesis [2]. Vascular endothelial growth

human prostate cancer cells [14]. Nevertheless, this
novel compound has also been shown to suppress the
proliferation of human non-small cell lung cancer through
induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [15]. However,
data on the influence of formononetin on breast cancer
angiogenesis and the underlying mechanisms are yet to be
fully elucidated. Despite important progress in adjuvant
and neoadjuvant therapies, angiogenesis often develops
in breast cancer patients and remains the leading cause
of their deaths. Recently, small-molecule multikinase
inhibitors targeting VEGFRs have been shown to have
therapeutic potential in preclinical and/or clinical testing
against breast tumour. For example, sorafenib, which can
inhibit VEGFRs, has been used successfully in the clinic
to prolong the survival rate of hepatocarcinoma patients.
However, quite a few multi-target therapies show toxicity
and have only moderate response rates. In the present
study, we investigate the effects of formononetin on
angiogenesis and the growth of human breast cancer cells
and nude mouse xenografts. The results obtained provide
evidence for the broader use of formononetin as an antiangiogenesis agent against human breast cancers.
In the present study, we described formononetin
inhibited FGF2 induced FGFR2 activation at relatively
low concentrations in vitro assays. Based on its molecular
mechanism, it significantly inhibited endothelial cells
proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation.
Moreover, it exhibited the ability to inhibit angiogenesis
in the rat artic ring assay and chick embryo chorioallantoic
membrane (CAM) angiogenesis model. At molecular level
we showed that formononetin inhibited angiogenesis
by blocking the FGFR2-mediated PI3K-Akt signaling
pathways in endothelial cells. Because of the critical
role of STAT3 activation in endothelial cells migration
and tube formation, we hypothesized that formononetin
may mediate its effects through suppression of STAT3
activity. In vitro, we found that formononetin indeed
suppressed FGF2 inducible STAT3 activation. Additional,
formononetin directly inhibited breast cancer cell
proliferation and blocked the oncogenic PI3k-Akt
signaling pathways in tumor cells. Furthermore, this
compound had excellent pharmacokinetic profiles that
made it suitable for chronic once-daily oral administration
in vivo. Formononetin significantly inhibited the growth
of tumor xenografts in athymic mice. In additional, we
investigated the effect of formononetin and sunitinib (a
RTK inhibitor targeting VEGFR2) combination treatment
in cancer cells. We found that the combination treatment
significantly decreased cancer cell invasion stimulated by
FGF2 in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Taken together,
our data suggested that formononetin could function as a
novel FGFR2 inhibitor that suppresses tumor angiogenesis
and growth.

and induce resistance to existing antiangiogenic therapy
[4]. Besides VEGF, There is a family of proteins that
include placenta growth factor (PIGF), fibroblast growth
factor (FGF1), FGF2, Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3),
c-Met, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha
(PDGFRα) directly participate in the genesis of blood
capillaries and lymphatic vessels [5]. Furthermore,
recent studies have identified FGF2 as a direct activator
of phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase
(PI3K)-protein kinase B (Akt), which are key stimuli
known to initiate endothelial cell migration, invasion
and differentiation. Recent studies have suggested that
the PI3K might play a vital role in tumor angiogenesis
[6]. Akt is a pivotal downstream target of PI3K during
angiogenesis. Akt regulates multiple cellular processes
including tumor angiogenesis, cell cycle progression, cell
growth, cell migration, and cell metabolism [7]. Fbroblast
growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) activation after
FGF2 binding causes phosphorylation of Akt signaling
resulting in increased activation of signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), c-Jun and nuclear
factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells
(NF-κB) p65 [8]. STAT3 is often constitutively active in
many human cancer cells, including multiple myeloma,
leukemia, lymphoma, and solid tumors. STAT3 is a latent
transcription factor that resides in the cytoplasm. Upon
activation, STAT3 dimerizes, translocates to the nucleus
and binds to nuclear DNA to modulate transcription of
target genes. The activation of STAT3 results in expression
of many target genes including matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and angiopoietin-2
(Ang-2) which are required for tumor cell migration,
angiogenesis as well as metastasis [9].
Currently, several strategies have been already
reported to block the action of kinase signialing pathway
besides VEGF-VEGFR2, including natural compounds,
peptidomimetic compounds, and small molecules.
Phytochemicals are potential novel leads for developing
anti-angiogenic drugs [10]. Flavonoids are polyphenolic
substances, widely distributed in almost every food plant,
that possess antiviral, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory,
anti-thrombotic, antineoplasic, antimutagenic, and
cytoprotective effects on different cell types [11]. The
dried root of Astragalus membranaceus (Radix Astragali)
has a long history of medicinal use in traditional chinese
medicine as an immunomodulating agent in mixed herbal
decoctions to treat the diarrhea, common cold, anorexia
and fatigue [12]. In contemporary pharmacotherapy, Radix
Astragali has been used to ameliorate the side-effects of
cytotoxic antineoplastic drugs [13]. Formononetin is
one of the major isoflavonoid constituents isolated from
Astragalus membranaceus and has been demonstrated
diverse pharmacological benefits [14]. It possesses antiangiogenic activity in human colon cancer cells and
tumor xenograft. Formononetin also promotes cell cycle
arrest via downregulation of Akt/Cyclin D1/CDK4 in

was a potent FGFR2 inhibitor.

Kinase inhibition profile of formononetin

Formononetin inhibited the response of HUVECs
to FGF2

In this study, formononetin was screened by kinase
inhibition assay by the use of radiometric assays provided
by Kinase Profile Service (Millipore, UK). The effects
of formononetin (Figure 1A) on kinase activity were
detected using the scintillation proximity assay method at
an enzymatic level. As shown in Table 1, formononetin
exhibited great inhibitory activity on FGFR2 with an
inhibitory rate of 89% at 1 µM. In addition, the inhibitory
activity of formononetin was examined against FGFR1
because of its structural and expression level similarity
to the FGFR2. Formononetin showed a relatively low
inhibitory rate of 57%, 5%, 0%, and 1% against FGFR1,
VEGFR2, PDGFRα, and PDGFRβ at 1 µM, respectively.
Moreover, excellent selectivity for FGFR2 was evident
compared with a range of unrelated tyrosine and serine/
threonine kinases, including Flt3, c-Kit, c-Met, epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR), c-RAF etc.
To investigate whether formononetin decreased the
kinase activity of FGFR2, we performed in vitro kinase
assay with different concentrations of formononetin
using CycLex® FGFR2 Kinase Assay kit according to
manufacturer suggested methods. Our data demonstrated
that formononetin directly inhibited FGFR2 kinase activity
in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of ~4.31 μM
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

To examine the anti-angiogenesis effects of
formononetin in vitro, proliferation of FGF2 induced
HUVECs was detected first. As shown in Figure 2A, the
proliferation of endothelial cells stimulated by FGF2 was
markedly decreased after formononetin treatment ranging
from 25 to 150 μM. Besides, formononetin had obscure
inhibition effect on the proliferation of HUVECs in the
absence of FGF2. To validate whether formononetin
would result in toxicity effects on HUVECs, LDH
cytotoxicity assay was carried out. As shown in Figure
2B, Triton X-100 significantly increased LDH release
and formononetin brought little toxic effects on HUVECs
when compared to vehicle control.
Cell migration and invasion are essential for
HUVECs in angiogenesis. We performed wound
healing assay (Figure 2C) to investigate the effects of
formononetin on cell mobility and observed formononetin
strongly inhibited the migration of HUVECs stimulated
by FGF2. We also performed transwell invasion assay
to evaluate the ability of HUVECs to pass through the
Matrigel in the presence of various concentrations of
formononetin. As shown in Figure 2D, formononetin
significantly inhibited the invasion activities of HUVECs

decreased FGF2 binding to FGFR2, we performed in vitro
Immunoprecipitation-western blot analysis using HUVEC
revealed that formononetin appeared to decrease FGF2
binding to its receptor, FGFR2 (Figure 4A). The same
method was applied to assess FGF2 binding to FGFR1
and formononetin effect (Supplementary Figure 2). To
verify the Immunoprecipitation-western blot results, we
determined the binding of formononetin for FGFR2 using
molecular modelling studies (Supplementary Figure 3).
Then, we investigated the effects of formononetin on
FGFR2 signaling pathway in HUVECs. As shown in
Figure 4B and 4C, formononetin clearly reduced FGF2
stimulated of FGFR2 phosphorylation rather than inhibited
FGFR1 activity (Supplementary Figure 4). Formononetin
also clearly reduced FGF2 stimulated phosphorylation
of FGFR2 downstream PI3K and Akt in HUVECs in
a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 4D). In
contrast, total levels of PI3K, and Akt were not affected
by formononetin treatment. Meanwhile, PI3K and Akt
mRNA were not inhibited by formononetin (Figure 4E).
The above results revealed that formononetin inhibited
in vitro angiogenesis by directly targeting FGF2-FGFR2
axis on the surface of HUVECs, and further suppressing
FGFR2 associated signaling pathways.

stimulated by FGF2 in a concentration-dependent manner.
To elucidate the possible mechanisms of angiogenesis
inhibition, tube formation ability of endothelial cells,
which is a critical step in the process of angiogenesis,
was assessed in HUVECs in vitro. As shown in Figure
2E, HUVECs pated on the surface of Migtrigel formed
capillary-like structures in the vehicle group within 6
hours. However, treatment with designed concentrations
of formononetin strongly inhibited the tube formation of
HUVECs.

To future evaluate the potential effect of
formononetin on angiogenesis, two well-established
angiogenesis models chicken CAM and rat artic ring assay
were used ex vivo and in vivo. We determined the effects of
formononetin on microvessel sprouting ex vivo using the
rat aortic ring assay. Our results showed that formononetin
almost completely inhibited FGF2 induced sprouting from
the aortic rings (Figure 3A). Furthermore, in the CAM
assay, FGF2 could significantly induce neovascularization,
whereas treatment with formononetin potently inhibited
FGF2 induced neovascularization (Figure 3B).

To identify transcription factors that are targeted by
formononetin, we assessed its effect on the transcriptional
activity of several transcription factors that play
important roles in HUVECs proliferation and migration.
Interestingly, formononetin strongly suppressed FGF2

In the presence or absence of extracellular FGF2,

HUVECs remains unchanged (Supplementary Figure 1).
However, the phosphorylation of FGFR2 after binding
with FGF2 and its downstream protein kinase stimulates
angiogenesis. To investigate whether formononetin

STAT3 expression, we assessed the expression of total
and phosphorylated STAT3 in HUVECs treated with
formononetin by western blotting. We found that the
STAT3 total expression level remained unchanged after
formononetin treatment, whereas STAT3 phosphorylation
was inhibited by formononetin (Figure 5B). However, the
effect of FGF2 stimulated activity of c-Jun and NF-κB p65

was not inhibited by formononetin (Supplementary Figure
6). Additionally, the activity of STAT3 was also regulated
by subcellular localization, we therefore attempted
to explore the effect of formononetin in different cell
fractions. The experiment showed that the nuclear STAT3
phosphorylation in HUVEC was evidently abrogated by
formononetin (Figure 5C). The activity of STAT3 was

also regulated by subcellular localization, we therefore
attempted to explore the subcellular distribution of STAT3
by immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy.
As illustrated in Figure 5D, HUVECs cells treatment with
formononetin (25 μM) under FGF2 hardly decreased
broad nuclear translocation of STAT3, while FGF2
rendered STAT3 stability and general nuclear distribution.
To further investigate whether formononetin can repress
the transcription of STAT3 downstream targets which
are association with HUVEC migration and invasion, we
performed quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses
for STAT3 target genes such as MMP-2/9, transforming
growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), CD31, COX-2, and Ang2.

qRT-PCR analyses demonstrated that formononetin
decreased the mRNA expression levels of the STAT3
target genes (Figure 5E). In agreement with qRT-PCR
results, formononetin also significantly diminished the
protein levels of those genes (Figure 5F). These findings
demonstrate that formononetin suppresses of STAT3 target
gene transcription.
Taking into account that MMPs such as MMP-2 and
MMP-9 can be involved in the development of several
human malignancies, as degradation of collagen IV in
basement membrane and extracellular matrix facilitates
tumor progression, including invasion, metastasis, and
angiogenesis, we analyzed their activity. Quantification of

were co-transfected with p-STAT3-TA-Luc and renilla luciferase (0.1 μg plasmid DNA per well in total) for 18 h, then were sitimulated

MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities using a fluorogenic assay
showed a significantly decrease in extracellular MMP-2
and MMP-9 activity in formononetin treated HUVECs
(Figure 5G).

investigated the effect of formononetin on the apoptosis
of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells by DNA fragmentation
assay and PARP cleavage assay. Inconsistent with
growth inhibition effect, formononetin had no effect on
the apoptosis in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells
(Supplementary Figure 8). Meanwhile, the expression of
cleavage PARP was slight in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7
cells treated with formononetin (Supplementary Figure 8).
Collectively, these data demonstrated that formononetin
had universal anticancer activity in breast cancer cells and
especially inhibited MDA-MB-231 cells proliferation.
To verify whether formononetin could inhibit
anchorage-independent growth of MDA-MB-231
cells, we performed soft agar colony formation assays.
Formononetin greatly decreased, in a dose-dependent
manner, the number and the size of colonies of MDAMB-231cells grown in soft agar. (Figure 6B), suggesting
that formononetin inhibits the in vitro transformation
capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells. As PI3K and Akt are
reported downstream signalings of FGFR2 and also
involving in tumor growth, we detected the PI3K and
Akt by western blot and RT-PCR. The results showed
that the PI3K and Akt activities were significantly
reduced after formononetin administration (Figure 6C).

Formononetin inhibited cell proliferation and
FGFR2 signaling in breast cancer
To access the anti-breast cancer activities of
formononetin, four human breast cancer cell lines T-47D,
SK-BR-3, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, as well as human
mammary gland cells Hs 578Bst were chose. All breast
cancer cells secrete high mount of FGF2 as well as express
higher FGFR2 protein than FGFR1, and the level is much
higher than in Hs 578Bst cells (Supplementary Figure 7).
As shown in Figure 6A, we found formononetin inhibited
breast cancer cell proliferation in a dose responsive
manner. IC50 values from each cell line were calculated
and we noted the inhibitory effect on Hs 578Bst kept
at high micro-molar concentrations than the effect of
equivalent doses of formononetin in breast cancer cells.
However, the sensitivity of four breast cancer cell lines
to formononetin was independent on FGFR2 level based
on Figure 6A and Supplementary Figure 7. We also

In order to confirm formononetin targets FGFR2, we
future assayed the FGFR2-PI3K-Akt signaling in the
presence of FGF2. As shown in Figure 6D, formononetin
significantly suppress FGFR2 phosphorylation and its
down-regulate PI3k, Akt activities. Nevertheless, FGFR1
and its downstream regulatory proteins on breast cancer
cells were not affected by formononetin (Supplementary

evaluate whether formononetin could suppress tumorinduced angiogenesis. Prior studies demonstrated that
MDA-MB-231 cell line was the often first choice as preclinical models for selection of targeted therapies owing to
its high aggressive nature either in vitro or in vivo. Thus,
immunodeficient mice bearing MDA-MB-231 xenografts
were treated daily with or without formononetin (100
mg/kg) by intragastric administration for 25 days. After
treated for 25 d, the mice were sacrificed and tumor tissues
were taken out for further analysis. Representative mice
with MDA-MB-231 xenografts and tumor masses were
shown in Figure 7A. It was found that formononetin
dramatically suppressed tumor volumes (Figure 7B)
and the formononetin-treated group tumor weight were
significantly inhibited compared with the vehicle group

(Figure 7C). Furthermore, formononetin treatment was
well tolerated, and there was no significant difference in
weight between vehicle group and formononetin treated
groups (Figure 7D). In addition, no lesion was observed
in the heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney and brain of
formononetin-treated mice (data not shown), suggesting
that formononetin treatment was well tolerated.
To further examine whether formononetin could
suppress breast cancer growth by inhibiting angiogenesis,
tumor tissues were stained with specific antibodies
against CD31, p-STAT3Ser727 and p-FGFR2Tyr463. Cluster of
differentiation (CD31) is a widely used endothelial marker

for quantifying angiogenesis by calculating microvessel
density (MVD). Tumor sections stained with anti-CD31
antibody revealed that formononetin inhibited MVD
(Figure 7E). Formononetin-treated mice also showed
a significant reduction of p-FGFR2Tyr463-positive cells
in tumors. As shown in Figure 7E, formononetin also
decreased phosphorylation of STAT3 in MDA-MB-231
xenograft tumors, which was consistent with the results
in vitro. In addition, formononetin treatment also resulted
in down-regulation of FGF2Rα downstream molecules
phosphorylation including PI3K, Akt, STAT3, and

Discussion

formononetin played an important role in suppressing
angiogenesis at least partly through FGF2/FGFR2
signaling pathways.

Tumor angiogenesis is pivotal for tumor growth
and metastasis. Among the numerous factors involved
in angiogenesis, the role of VEGF and VEGFR2 is well
established, but other angiogenic factors switch on during
cancer progression and induce resistance to VEGFR
inhibitors monotherapy [2]. FGF2 is a pleiotropic cytokine
that stimulates endothelial cell growth, migration, and
survival. Unlike VEGF, FGF2 selectively binds its
receptor FGFR2 and stimulates angiogenesis, tumor
growth and endothelial cell migration, indicating that
FGF2 has biological activity in vivo [27]. FGFR2 activity
has previously been shown to act through the PI3K/Akt
signaling pathway. Our group has been engaged in the
screening novel angiogenesis inhibitors and in this study,
we identified formononetin had significant inhibitory
effects on HUVECs function by suppressing HUVECs
proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation
in vitro. HUVECs proliferation plays an important role
in the process of angiogenesis from preexisting vessels,
therefore, we examined whether formononetin showed

Combination of formononetin and VEGFR2
inhibitor sunitinib synergistically blocks tumor
growth
On the basis of the potent in vitro and in vivo antiangiogenic and anti-cancer growth properties elicited by
formononetin, we next examined if formononetin could
enhance the anti-cancer growth efficacy of sunitinib, a
VEGFR2 inhibitor. Formononetin and sunitinib alone
significantly inhibited tumor tissues compared with the
vehicle group, and the combination of these two was
significantly more effective (Figure 8A). To address the
effects of combination treatment of formononetin and
sunitinib on FGF2-induces HUVECs invasion, cells were
treated with 25 μM formononetin, 10 μM sunitinib, or their
combination. As shown in Figure 8B, the combination
treatment almost completely decreased HUVECs invasion
in vitro.

the cancer cells treated, in a concentration-dependent
manner. Extending these analyses in vivo, formononetin
obviously inhibited tumor angiogenesis in vivo in a nude
mouse xenograft model where human breast cancer
cells were grown subcutaneous. Histological studies of
tumor sections revealed that formononetin significantly
reduced angiogenesis indexed by CD31 and p-FGFR2Tyr463
antibodies. Moreover, similar to the FGF2 signaling
inhibition effects observed in vitro, formononetin also
significant decrease PI3K, Akt, MMP-2, MMP-9, and
STAT3 in MDA-MB-231 tumor sections according to
western blot, further demonstrating that formononetin
played an important role in suppressing angiogenesis at
least in part via FGFR2 signaling pathway. For another
experiment in vivo, the combination treatment caused
much more tumor suppression than that of single treatment
of either formononetin or sunitinib, which further
confirmed our conclusion. Consistently, the combination
treatment significantly inhibit HUVECs invasion, which
is an important step in the tumor angiogenesis process.
Taken together, these results demonstrate that a novel
molecule capable of disrupting the binding of FGF2 to its
receptor FGFR2 and inhibits FGFR2-dependent signaling
and suppresses angiogenesis and tumorigenesis (Figure 9).

anti-proliferative effects on HUVECs after stimulation
by FGF2.The results showed that formononetin markedly
inhibited HUVECs proliferation stimulated by FGF2.
Angiogenesis are complex processes which occur by
a series of complex events including endothelial cells
migration and invasion. In this study, according to
wound healing, Transwell invasion assays, formononetin
effectively inhibited the migration and invasion of
HUVECs. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that
formononetin inhibits FGF2-dependentstimulation of
the capillary-like networks formation of endothelial
cells, as well as suppresses FGF2 induced blood vessel
formation in CAM, which was consistent with the result
that formononetin could inhibit rat artery ring sprouting.
Protein-protein interactions and regulate the
signal transduction circuitry play pivotal roles in tumor
metastasis as well as angiogenesis. FGF2 regulates
angiogenesis and by binding to its receptor FGF2R,
which is expressed in vinous cancer cells, including nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gastric carcinoma and
prostatic cancer (Supplementary Figure 10). FGF2R is
required for the migration and growth of endothelial
cell. The functions of vascular endothelial cells rely on
FGF2R signaling and FGF2R phosphorylation initiates
downstream signaling pathways [28]. In this study, we
identified formononetin disrupt FGF2 interaction with
its receptor FGF2R and inhibited FGF2 binding to its
receptor FGFR2. Western blot results indicated that
formononetin selectively inhibited the activity of FGF2R
and immunofluorescence assay verified these results.
Activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway has been shown
to promote endothelial cells proliferation and motility.
Akt regulates several endothelial cells functions such as
migration and proliferation, and stimulates the production
of STAT3 transcription factors. In this study, formononetin
significantly inhibited FGF2 stimulated phosphorylation
of FGF2R and downstream PI3K and Akt in HUVECs,
indicating its ability to block angiogenesis. STAT3 is a
well-known key downstream component of the PI3KAkt pathway. Phosphorylated STAT3 is translocated into
the nucleus to transmit extracellular signals that regulate
cell growth, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and
migration functions [29]. STAT3 is a well-known inducer
of MMPs and angiogenic factors including TGF-β, CD31,
COX-2 and Ang2 in tumor cells. We have detected a
significant decrease in extracellular MMP-2/9 activity
and expression. Moreover, formononetin inhibited
the expression of TGF-β, CD31, COX-2 and Ang2
downstream-regulator of STAT3, which stimulates tumor
angiogenesis and tumor growth.
Besides inhibiting angiogenesis, formononetin
also had a direct inhibitory effect on tumor cells. It
showed inhibitory effects in cancer cell viability assays
and the IC50 values of formononetin inhibited the
proliferation of MDA-MBN-231cells at 16 μM, which
are most sensitive to formononetin treatment among

Materials and methods
Cell culture and formononetin preparation
The human breast cancer cell line T-47D, SKBR-3, MCF-7 MDA-MB-231 andhuman mammary gland
epithelial cells HCC1937 was purchased from the ATCC,
and maintained in L-15 medium supplemented with 10%
FBS. HUVEC was purchased from Chi Scientific, and
were cultivated in gelatinized culture plates in M199
medium supplemented with 15% FBS, 1% PS, 50 µg/
ml endothelial cell growth supplement (ECGS, BD
Bioscience) and 100 µg/ml heparin. Formononetin (98%,
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO, final concentration is 0.1%) to prepare
required concentrations.

One solution cell proliferation assay
The cell viability was determined by CellTiter 96®
Aqueous One Solution cell proliferation assay (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA). Briefly, cells were seeded in 96well cell culture plates and treated with indicated agents.
After incubation for indicated time period, 20 μL of One
Solution reagent were added to each well and incubation
was continued for additional 4 h. The absorbance was
measured at 490 nm using Synergy™ HT Multi-Mode
Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT, USA). The
effect of indicated agents on cell viability was assessed

as the percent of cell viability compared with vehicletreated control cells, which were arbitrarily assigned 100%
viability [16]. The concentration of formononetin resulting
in 50% inhibition of control growth (IC50) was calculated
by SPSS statistics software.

until large colonies were evident. Cells were stained with
crystal violet for colony counting.

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) toxicity assay

The tube formation assay was performed using
12-well plate coated with 100 µl Matrigel basement
membrane matrix (BD Bioscience) per well and
polymerized at 37°C for 30 min. HUVECs suspended in
M199 medium containing 2% FBS were plated on the
Matrigel at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well. Formononetin
(10, and 25 µM) were then added together with FGF2.
After 6 h, The Matrigel-induced morphological changes
were photographed and the extent of capillary tube
formation was evaluated by measuring the total tube
length per field [20].

Tube formation assay

The LDH released into cell cultures is an index of
cytotoxicity and evaluation of the permeability of cell
membrane. HUVECs were seeded in 96-well plate at a
density of 3 × 103 cells per well. After incubation with
vehicle (0.1% DMSO), 1% Triton X-100 or various
concentrations of formononetin for 24 h, cell supernatants
were collected and analyzed for LDH activity using
LDH cyto-toxicity assay kit from Keygen biotech. The
absorbance of formed formazan was read at 490 nm on a
microplate reader [16].

Rat aortic ring assay

Wound healing

Rat aortic ring assay was performed as described
previously [21]. In brief, 48-well plates were coated
with 120 μL of Matrigel per well and polymerized in an
incubator. Aortas isolated from 6-week-old male SpragueDawley rats were cleaned of periadventitial fat and
connective tissues in cold phosphate-buffered saline and
cut into rings of 1~1.5 mm in circumference. The aortic
rings were randomized into wells and sealed with a 100 μL
overlay of Matrigel. FGF2 in 500 μL of serum-free M199
with or without formononetin was added into the wells,
and the fresh medium was exchanged for every 2 d. After
6 d, microvessel sprouting was fixed and photographed
using an inverted microscope (Olympus).

We examined the migration of HUVECs using a
wound-healing assay. Briefly, cells were each grown on
3.5-cm plates with their respective culture media. After
the growing cell layers had reached confluence, we
inflicted a uniform wound in each plate using a pipette tip,
and washed the wounded layers with PBS to remove all
cell debris. Then, we evaluated the closure at 48 h using
bright-field microscopy [17].

Invasion assay
Assay was performed with Matrigel-coated
chambers from a BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chamber Kit
(BD Biosciences). Cells with 500 µl in serum-free medium
were added into the upper chamber and complete medium
was added into the lower chamber. After incubation for 24
h, non-invasive cells in the upper surface of the membrane
were removed and the cells invasion to the lower surface
of the membrane were fixed. Cell counting was then
carried out by photographing the membrane through the
microscope [18] and five random fields were taken.

Chick chorioallantoic membrane assay
Chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay was
performed, as described previously [22].

Western blotting assay
In brief, cell lysates were separated by 8% SDSPAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes. Membranes were then incubated with primary
antibodies including indicated antibodies. After overnight
incubation at 4°C, membranes were incubated with
secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were then
visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)
detection system (GE healthcare).

Anchorage-independent growth assay
Soft agar colony-formation assays were performed
as previously described with minor modifications [19].
MDA-MB-231 (1 × 104) cells in 1.5 mL of growth
medium were mixed with 1.5 mL of 0.5% agarose in
warmed growth medium containing vehicle (0.1%
DMSO) or formononetin and layered on 0.5% base agar
in 60-mm cell culture dishes. Culture medium containing
scoparone was added only once; subsequently, medium
without formononetin was added every week for 21 days

kinase assay (Z’-lyte assay, Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). The
kinase domains of FGFR2 was assayed in 50 mm HEPES
pH 7.5, 0.01% BRIJ-35, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2,
1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, with 20 μm or 80 μm ATP,
respectively. The assay was performed in triplicate in 384well plates according to the manufacturer’s instructions
[23].

HUVECs cells were incubated with formononetin
for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted using the QIAzol lysis
reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), and 1 µg of total
RNA was reverse transcribed using the RevertAid First
Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA) according to the manufacturers’ instructions.
For qRT-PCR, 25-50 ng of cDNA was used for PCR
amplification using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) with the ViiA™
7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Acidic
ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 (RPLP0; 36B4) was used
as an internal control [25]. PCR condition and primer
sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

Immunofluorescence analysis
The effects of formononetin on FGF2 induced
expression of FGFR2 phosphorylation in HUVECs were
examined using an immunocytochemical method [24].
Cells were pretreated with or without formononetin for
24 h in the presence of FGF2. For immunofluorescent
labeling, anti- p-FGFR2Tyr463 antibody was used as primary
antibody and goat anti-rabbit IgG-FITC was used as a
secondary antibody. Fluorescence cells were observed and
photographed under a laser scanning confocal microscope
(LEICA TCS SP5, Mannheim, Germany).

Xenograft models and immunohistochemistry
detections
3×106 human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells
were subcutaneously implanted into female, BALB/c
nude mice to build breast cancer xenograft. Mice with
appropriate size of tumors were divided randomly into two
groups including vehicle-treated group and Formononetin
dosage group (100 mg/kg/day). The mice were treated
with formononetin or carboxy methylated cellulose
(vehicle) daily by intragastric administration. Tumor
volume and mice body weight were measured every 3
days. Tumor volume was calculated as mm3 = 0.5 × length
(mm)3 width (mm)2 [26]. After sacrificing mice on day 25,
tumors and normal tissues will be harvested for western
blotting. Band intensities were quantified using image-J
software. Deparaffinized tumor sections were stained with
specific antibodies including CD31, p-STAT3Ser727, and
p-VEGFR2Tyr951. Detection was done with avidin-biotinHRP complex (Thermo scientific) and diaminobenzidine as
chromogen. Nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin.
p-FGFR2Tyr463 positive cells were counted in five random
high-power fields per section and were reported as a
percentage of positive cells in each cellular compartment.
Mean integrated optical density (mean IOD) of blood
vessels accords to the following formula: mean IOD=IOD/
area of the tumor section. All animal experiments were
carried out in compliance with the Guidelines for the
Shandong University School of Medicine.

Immunoprecipitation assay
HUVECs were lysed in a culture dish by adding 0.5
mL of ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer. The supernatants were
collected by centrifugation at 15,000 g for 10 minutes at
4°C and then incubated with IgG or FGF2 in presence or
absence of formononetin at 4°C overnight, followed by
incubation with anti-FGF2 for 4 hours. Then, supernatants
were incubation with protein G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz)
for 4 hours. Following the removal of supernatant by brief
centrifugation (6,000 g), the protein G-Sepharose were
washed 3 times with lysis buffer and then boiled for 5
minutes in loading buffer [16]. Immunoprecipitates was
further analyzed by western blotting using anti-FGFR2
antibody and anti-FGF antibody.

Luciferase reporter gene assay
HUVECs in 96 well culture plates were transiently
transfected with 0.1 μg/well p-STAT3-TA-Luc reporter
plasmids, p-c-Jun-TA-Luc reporter plasmids or p-NFκB p65-TA-Luc reporter plasmids (Biotime Biotech,
Haimen, China). Transfection efficiency was normalized
with renilla luciferase reporter plasmids. After 18 h posttransfection, cells were treated with indicated agents.
Relative promoter activity was measured by dualluciferase reporter (DLR) assay system using the Glomax
96 Microplate Luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA).
