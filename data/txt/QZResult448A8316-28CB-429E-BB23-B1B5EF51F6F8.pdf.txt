Abstract
Apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC) inhibits both death receptor- and mitochondrial/
ER-mediated pathways of apoptosis. Although expressed mainly in terminally differentiated cells, ARC is
markedly upregulated in a variety of human cancers, where its potential contributions have not yet been
deﬁned. In this study, we provide evidence of multiple critical pathophysiologic functions for ARC in breast
carcinogenesis. In the polyoma middle T-antigen (PyMT) transgenic mouse model of breast cancer, in which
endogenous ARC is strongly upregulated, deletion of the ARC-encoding gene nol3 decreased primary tumor
burden without affecting tumor onset or multiplicity. More notably, ARC deﬁciency also limited tumor cell
invasion and the number of circulating cancer cells, markedly reducing the number of lung metastases.
Conversely, ectopic overexpression of ARC in a PyMT-derived metastatic breast cancer cell line increased
invasion in vitro and lung metastasis in vivo. We conﬁrmed these results in a humanized orthotopic model based
on MDA-MB-231-derived LM2 metastatic breast cancer cells, in which RNAi-mediated knockdown of ARC levels
was shown to reduce tumor volume, local invasion, and lung metastases. Lastly, we found that endogenous levels
of ARC conferred chemoresistance in primary tumors and invading cell populations. Our results establish that
ARC promotes breast carcinogenesis by driving primary tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis as well as by
promoting chemoresistance in invasive cells. Cancer Res; 71(24); 7705–15. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the second most common cause of cancer
deaths in women with mortality attributable to the metastatic
spread to vital organs such as lung, liver, and bone (1).
Furthermore, the resistance of invasive cells to cancer therapies is a major barrier to patient survival (2). Therefore, an
improved understanding of the endogenous factors that mediate tumorigenesis, invasion, metastasis, and treatment resistance is essential for improving outcome. Both promotion of
cellular proliferation and suppression of apoptosis are critical
for carcinogenesis (3), and proteins that control these processes are often dysregulated (4). Defects in apoptosis have
been implicated in multiple aspects of carcinogenesis includ-

ing the survival of transformed cells, resistance to hypoxia,
metastasis, and resistance to various therapeutic agents (3–6).
Apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC)
is an endogenous inhibitor of apoptosis (7, 8) that has the
unusual property of antagonizing both the extrinsic (death
receptor) and intrinsic (mitochondrial/ER) pathways (9). We
and others have delineated molecular mechanisms that mediate
these actions including direct interactions of ARC with (a) Fas,
FADD, and procaspase-8, which interfere with DISC assembly
(9); (b) Bax, that suppress Bax conformational activation and
mitochondrial translocation (9, 10); and (c) p53 that inhibit p53
transcriptional function and nuclear localization (11).
Under normal conditions, ARC is abundant primarily in
terminally differentiated cells such as cardiac and skeletal
myocytes and neurons (7, 8). ARC expression is strongly
upregulated, however, in a wide variety of cancer cell lines
(12–16). Moreover, we and others have noted that ARC levels
are markedly increased in primary human epithelial cancers
including breast, colon, cervical, and ovarian compared with
the corresponding normal tissues (12, 13), and in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML; ref. 17). Increases in ARC protein
levels in some cancers, including breast, are mediated by Ras
signaling through both transcriptional activation of nol3, the
locus encoding ARC, and stabilization of the ARC protein (18).
Microarray analyses indicate that ARC expression is a predictor of invasion and metastasis in humans (19, 20), and high ARC
levels prognosticate decreased survivorship in glioblastoma
multiforme (16) and AML (17). Moreover, manipulation of ARC

levels in cancer cell lines has been shown to regulate their
sensitivities to various chemotherapies (12, 16, 18, 21, 22).
Although the induction of ARC in human cancers is well
established, the functional relevance of this protein to the
pathogenesis of any cancer is not known. In this study, we
employed a combination of genetically manipulated mice and
xenograft studies to delineate the role of ARC in the pathogenesis of breast cancer from tumor onset through metastasis.
The data show that ARC is a previously unrecognized regulator
of multiple aspects of breast carcinogenesis and modulates the
sensitivities of both primary tumors and the invading cell
population to chemotherapy.

Materials and Methods
Plasmids, viruses, cells
Retrovirus encoding ARC-HA (9) was generated using
pBabe-Neo (Addgene) in 293T Phoenix amphotropic
packaging cells (American Type Culture Collection; 23).
pLKO.1-puro, containing shRNA sequences targeted to human
ARC [30 UTR: TRCN0000118447 (shRNA 47) or coding region:
TRCN0000118448 (shRNA 48)] or a control shRNA (Sigma), was
used to generate lentivirus in HEK293T cells (23, 24). LM2
(subline 4175; ref. 25) cells (provided by Drs. S. Tavazoie and J.
Massague) and Met-1 cells (Ref. 26; provided by Dr. Jeffrey
Pollard) were stably transduced with virus using Polybrene 8
mg/mL (Sigma), and pools of cells studied. Cells derived from
the provided starting isolates were passaged for no more than 2
to 3 months. The Met-1 cells were authenticated by Dr. Pollard
in the past year by showing continued expression of PyMT and
the absence of rejection when transplanted into FVB mice. The
LM2 cells have been characterized extensively by Dr. Massague
(25).
Generation of PyMT; nol3/ mice
We generated mice with generalized deletion both alleles of
nol3 (encompassing the entire open reading frame of ARC) and
backcrossed them onto a C57Bl/6 background as described
(27). The absence of ARC protein in hearts of nol3/ mice is
shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. These mice were backcrossed
6 times onto an FVB background and then crossed with FVB
mice hemizygous for an MMTV-PyMT transgene (28). As
shown in Fig. 1, PyMT; nol3/ mammary tumors lack ARC
protein, while PyMT; nol3þ/þ tumors express it abundantly.
Tissue/protein isolation and Western blotting
Cells and tissues were lysed using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer with protease inhibitors. Mammary epithelial
organoids were isolated as described (18). SDS-PAGE was done
with 20 to 40 mg of protein under reducing conditions and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (9). Immunoblotting
was done with rabbit polyclonal antisera against ARC (Cayman,
1:2,000) and a mouse monoclonal antibody against b-actin
(Sigma, 1:10,000), and analyzed with a Li-Cor Odyssey system.
Immunohistochemistry and histologic analyses
Tissues were ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and
immunohistochemistry done as described (18) using the ARC

7706

antisera (Cayman, 1:500) or a mouse monoclonal antibody
against Ki67 (Novocastra, 1:200), and counterstained with hematoxylin. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) was done using ApopTagPlus In Situ
Apoptosis Detection Kit (Chemicon). Lung metastases were
analyzed using 6 sections spaced at 300 mmol/L from a whole
embedded lung and stained with hematoxylin & eosin (H&E;
PyMT mice and Met-1 tail vein injections) or vimentin (Novocastra 1:500; LM2 xenograft model). Images of stained slides
were obtained with a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-S microscope and
Spot R/T CCD camera.
Invasion and blood burden assays
In vitro invasion assay was done as described with BD
BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers (BD 354480) using 2.5
 104 Met-1 cells and 10% FBS as chemoattractant more than
22-hour incubation. In vivo invasion assay was done as
described (29) with EGF (25 nmol/L) used as chemoattractant.
Cells were collected for 4 hours, stained with 40 ,6-diamidino-2phenylindole, and counted (29). Blood burden was assessed as
described (30) and tumor cell colonies from blood were grown
in 20% FBS/DMEM media and counted 7 days after plating.
Met-1 tail vein injections and LM2 xenograft model
Experimental metastasis was assessed by injecting 0.5  106
mouse Met-1 cells suspended in 300 mL of sterile PBS in the tail
vein of 8-week old female FVB mice, and lung metastases
analyzed 14 days later as described above. Mammary xenografts were produced by injecting human LM2 cells stably
expressing luciferase [1  106 cells in 100 mL of sterile PBS
containing 20% rat tail collagen (BD)] into the lower right
mammary gland of 6-week old female severe combined immunodeﬁcient (SCID) mice (National Cancer Institute). Tumor
volume was determined by caliper measurements (0.5  length
 width2) or bioluminescence imaging. Spontaneous lung
metastases were scored 8 weeks postinjection as above.
In vivo bioluminescence imagining and analysis
Mice with xenografts were injected with D-luciferin potassium salt [150 mg/kg intraperitoneal (i.p.), Caliper Life Sciences] for tumor detection or VivoGlo Caspase-3/7 Substrate
(z-DEVD-Aminoluciferin sodium salt, 50 mg/kg i.p., Promega)
for apoptosis detection. Anesthetized mice were imaged 12 to
15 minutes after injection using the Xenogen IVIS 200 series
system with Living Image software (Caliper Life Sciences) for
acquisition and analysis. Bioluminescence intensity plots are
quantiﬁed as photon ﬂux (p/sec/cm2/sr) for the region of
interest (ROI) as selected by the auto ROI tool.
Chemosensitivity assays
LM2 cells were plated at a density of 700 cells/mm2 and
treated with indicated doses of doxorubicin (Sigma) for 24
hours. Cell death was quantiﬁed with calcein AM/ethidium
bromide (Sigma) and counterstaining with Hoechst 33342 (10
mg/mL, Invitrogen) as described (31). SCID mice bearing LM2
mammary xenografts were injected with doxorubicin 5 mg/kg
when tumors reached a volume of approximately 100 cm3
(calipers), and apoptosis analyzed 72-hour postinjection by

Results
ARC expression is induced in mammary tumors of PyMT
mice
We have previously shown that ARC is abundant in primary
human breast cancers, but absent or expressed at very low
levels in normal breast tissue (12). Our initial approach to
assessing the functional importance of ARC in breast carcinogenesis was to employ mice hemizygous for a polyoma

middle T-antigen (PyMT) transgene expressed in the mammary epithelium under the control of mouse mammary
tumor virus (MMTV) long terminal repeats (hereafter
referred to as PyMT mice; ref. 28). The PyMT model is highly
penetrant and replicates critical aspects of the human
disease including progression from primary tumors to
metastases (33). The rationale for selecting an aggressive
model was to provide an especially challenging target for
subsequent rescue experiments. To determine whether this
is a suitable model in which to study the effects of ARC on
mammary carcinogenesis, we ﬁrst assessed whether ARC
expression is induced in PyMT mice. Transgenic expression
of PyMT markedly increased the abundance of ARC protein
in mammary tumors of various stages, including adenomas/
mammary intraepithelial neoplasia (MIN) and invasive carcinoma, compared with nontransgenic mice (Fig. 1A, top
row). ARC expression was evident in each tumor of each
PyMT mouse, although intensity of immunostaining varied
mildly among tumors. The speciﬁcity of the antisera is
indicated by the absence of ARC immunostaining in PyMT
mice in which both nol3 alleles were deleted (Fig. 1A, bottom
row). Similar results were evident by Western blotting (Fig.
1B). Interestingly, ARC expression persisted in metastases
dissected from lung tissue (Fig. 1C). These data show that
ARC expression is induced in early tumors to metastases of

PyMT mice, suggesting that ARC may be involved in multiple
stages of mammary carcinogenesis.
Endogenous ARC promotes tumor burden, but does not
affect tumor onset or multiplicity
To assess the role of ARC in mammary carcinogenesis, we
employed mice with generalized deletion of both nol3 alleles. In
the absence of a PyMT transgene, nol3 null mice showed no
baseline abnormalities and, speciﬁcally, exhibited no mammary pathology (not shown). When hemizygous for an MMTVPyMT transgene, nol3 null mice were born in Mendelian
proportions and without detectable abnormalities. Mammary
tumors ﬁrst became palpable in both PyMT; nol3þ/þ and
PyMT; nol3/ mice at 7 weeks of age (P NS), and by 10 weeks
of age, 100% of mice of each genotype exhibit at least one tumor
(Fig. 2A). Thus, the presence of ARC does not inﬂuence tumor
onset. Similarly, tumor multiplicity was not affected by ARC
(Fig. 2B). In contrast, tumor burden, the wet weight of all
excised tumors, differed markedly between PyMT; nol3þ/þ and
PyMT; nol3/ mice. Although differences were not yet evident

at 12 weeks, deletion of nol3 reduced tumor burden 34% (9.41 
0.78 g in PyMT; nol3þ/þ mice vs. 6.19  0.48 g in PyMT; nol3/
mice; P < 0.0001) at 14 weeks when tumor size is at the
maximum acceptable limit (Fig. 2C). Thus, endogenous levels
of ARC promote increases in tumor burden, which likely reﬂect
increases in individual tumor mass because tumor multiplicity
is unchanged.
Endogenous ARC promotes tumorigenesis through
increased proliferation rather than decreased apoptosis
To determine the mechanisms by which ARC increases
tumor burden in PyMT mice, we analyzed mammary tumors
for apoptosis and proliferation at 14 weeks of age. The difference in the number of TUNEL-positive tumor cells per ﬁeld
between PyMT; nol3þ/þ and PyMT; nol3/ mice was not
statistically signiﬁcant despite studying 8 to 10 mice of each
genotype (15.4  1.3 cells per ﬁeld in PyMT; nol3þ/þ vs. 17.2 
1.3 in PyMT; nol3/; P NS; Fig. 2D). Although this is surprising
in light of the established role of ARC as an apoptosis inhibitor,
it indicates that differences in apoptosis rates do not account

for effects on tumor burden. In contrast, cellular proliferation,
as measured by Ki67 staining, was 44% lower in PyMT; nol3/,
as compared with PyMT; nol3þ/þ, mice (356.9  20.8 in PyMT;
nol3þ/þ mice vs. 201.2  20.0 in PyMT; nol3/ mice; P <
0.0001; Fig. 2E). These data indicate that endogenous levels of
ARC promote proliferation of mammary cancer cells in vivo,
thereby contributing to increased tumor burden.
Endogenous ARC promotes invasion and metastasis
The high frequency with which primary mammary tumors
metastasize in the PyMT model allowed us to evaluate the

effect of ARC on invasion and metastasis. We ﬁrst determined
whether ARC inﬂuences local invasion in vivo by assessing the
abilities of tumor cells to gain access into needles containing
Matrigel that had been permeated with EGF as a chemoattractant. The needles were inserted directly into the primary
mammary tumors. Needles in tumors of PyMT; nol3/ mice
captured 44% less cells than those in tumors of PyMT; nol3þ/þ
mice (716.0  69.3 cells per needle in PyMT; nol3þ/þ mice vs.
399.0  57.7 in PyMT; nol3/ mice; P < 0.05; Fig. 3A). These
data indicate that ARC promotes local invasion in vivo, a key
step in metastatic progression.

Following invasion, tumor cells may gain access to blood or
lymph by intravasating into blood vessels or lymphatics, a
prelude to distant metastasis. The concentration of tumor cells
in blood or lymph reﬂects rates of intravasation minus extravasation. Accordingly, we next assessed the concentration of
tumor cells circulating in the blood or blood burden. The blood
burden of PyMT; nol3/ mice was 40% lower than that of
PyMT; nol3þ/þ mice (927.3  105.5 colonies per ml blood in
PyMT; nol3þ/þ mice vs. 560.3  118.6 in PyMT; nol3/ mice;
P < 0.05; Fig. 3B). Differences in plating efﬁciencies were
excluded using primary tumor cells from the 2 genotypes (not
shown).
To assess the effect of ARC on the onset and number of lung
metastases, we analyzed H&E-stained sections. Metastases were
not detectable in either genotype at 10 weeks of age. At 12 weeks,
6/14 PyMT; nol3þ/þ mice and 5/11 PyMT; nol3/ mice contained at least one lung metastasis (P NS), indicating similar
times of initiation of metastasis in both genotypes. At 14 weeks,
100% of the mice in both groups exhibited at least one detectable
lung metastasis. Importantly, however, the number of lung
metastases was 44% lower in PyMT; nol3/, as compared with
PyMT; nol3þ/þ, mice (12.0  1.6 in PyMT; nol3þ/þ vs. 7.0  1.7 in
PyMT; nol3/ mice; P < 0.05; Fig. 3C, left graph). Even following
normalization to tumor burden, the number of metastases
remains signiﬁcantly reduced in the mice with nol3 deletion
(P < 0.01; Fig. 3C, right graph). These data indicate that endogenous levels of ARC facilitate lung metastasis.
Converse effects from ARC overexpression
The above experiments assessed effects of ARC absence.
Conversely, we wished to evaluate the effect of ARC overexpression. Met-1 cells are a metastatic mouse mammary
tumor cell line derived from PyMT mice (26). Despite our
demonstration of ARC expression in lung metastases from
PyMT mammary tumors in vivo (Fig. 1C), the Met-1 line does
not contain endogenous ARC, making them suitable for gain
of function studies. Accordingly, we generated Met-1 cells
with stable with overexpression of ARC (Fig. 3D). In light of
our results showing a signiﬁcant effect of ARC deletion on
invasion in vivo, we ﬁrst tested ARC-overexpressing Met-1
cells in an in vitro invasion assay. Using a modiﬁed Boyden
chamber assay (34) with Matrigel as the barrier, Met-1 cells
expressing exogenous ARC showed 64% more invasion than
cells transduced with empty vector (24.7  4.5 cells per ﬁeld
in vector-transduced cells vs. 40.6  5.8 ARC-transduced
cells; P < 0.05; Fig. 3E). Statistically signiﬁcant differences
were not obtained in the absence of Matrigel indicating that
the observed effects likely reﬂect invasion rather than motility (not shown).
To assess whether ARC overexpression facilitates lung
metastasis, we employed tail vein injection assays, which
bypass the local invasion and intravasation steps required for
spontaneous metastasis in the PyMT model. When injected
into the tail vein of syngeneic wild-type FVB female mice, Met-1
cells overexpressing ARC resulted in 1.7-fold more lung metastases than did the vector control group (53.8  9.1 in mice
injected with vector control-transfected cells vs. 92.1  9.6 in
mice receiving in ARC-overexpressing cells; P < 0.01; Fig. 3F).

Thus, ARC overexpression in Met-1 cells promotes postintravasation metastatic efﬁciency.
Endogenous ARC promotes tumorigenesis, invasion, and
metastasis in a humanized model of breast cancer
To test our ﬁndings in a humanized breast cancer model, we
employed human LM2 cells, a subset of MDA-MB-231 cells that
have a tropism to metastasize to lung (25). Our approach was
to knock down ARC in these cells, xenograft them into the
mammary glands of SCID mice, and assess tumorigenesis,
invasion, and metastasis. In contrast to the generalized knockout of nol3 studied earlier, this model also allows us to assess
whether the various phenotypes result from deﬁciency of ARC
speciﬁcally in breast cancer cells.
ARC levels were reduced using lentiviral transduction of
different shRNAs (Fig. 4A). ARC shRNA 48, which results in 72%
knockdown in ARC levels (Fig. 4A), reduces xenograft tumor
volume most markedly (Fig. 4B). At 9-week posttransplantation, volume of tumors derived from ARC shRNA 48-expresssing cells is decreased 42% compared with those expressing
control shRNA (2475  217 mm3 with control shRNA vs. 1428 
142 mm3 with ARC shRNA 48; P < 0.0001). ARC shRNA 47, which
decreases ARC levels less dramatically (57%; Fig. 4A), results in
an intermediate decrease in tumor volume, although statistical
signiﬁcance was not achieved (Fig. 4B). We wished to detect
ARC-dependent changes in tumor volume at even earlier time
points when caliper measurements are not feasible. As the LM2
cells have been engineered to express luciferase, we detected
ARC-dependent differences in tumor volume using bioluminescence. Compared with transplanted cells expressing control shRNA, those expressing ARC shRNA 48 exhibit markedly
smaller tumors at 3-week posttransplantation [9.86  109 
1.01  109 p/s/r/cm2/sr (photon ﬂux) with control shRNA vs.
3.46  109  3.05  108 with ARC shRNA 48; P < 0.001], a ﬁnding
that is suggested even at 2 weeks, although statistical significance is not yet present at this time point (Fig. 4C).
We next assessed local invasion from LM2 tumors using the
in vivo invasion assay. ARC knockdown resulted in 64% less
invading cells (407.3  18.1 cells/needle with control shRNA vs.
148.2  10.4 with ARC shRNA 48; P < 0.0001; Fig. 4D). Mice were
also monitored for spontaneous lung metastases as assessed by
immunostaining with an antibody speciﬁc for human vimentin. At 8-week posttransplantation, the number of lung metastases was 62% less in mice receiving LM2 cells with ARC
knockdown (419.7  100.1 metastases per section with control
shRNA vs. 157.8  63.6 with ARC shRNA 48; P < 0.05; Fig. 4E).
Thus, as in PyMT mice (Figs. 2C and 3A and C), these data
show that endogenous levels of ARC promote increased tumor
volume, local invasion, and metastasis in a humanized model
of breast cancer. Moreover, cell autonomous mechanisms are
sufﬁcient to account for this effect.
Endogenous ARC confers chemoresistance to tumors
and invading cell population
We next determined whether ARC affects the susceptibility
of primary mammary tumors and the invading cell population
to chemotherapy. Cultured LM2 cells with ARC knockdown

ARC and Breast Cancer

(Fig. 5A). To assess potential effects of ARC on the susceptibility of primary tumors to chemotherapy in vivo, we measured
the apoptotic response of LM2 tumors to doxorubicin. This
was accomplished with bioluminescence using z-DEVD-aminoluciferin, which requires cleavage by caspases-3/7 to function as a luciferase substrate. ARC knockdown dramatically
potentiated the apoptotic response of tumors to doxorubicin
(Fig. 5B, bars 3 and 4; P < 0.05). Moreover, although tumors
deﬁcient in ARC responded to doxorubicin (Fig. 5B, bars 2 and
4; P < 0.05), control tumors exhibited no signiﬁcant changes in
apoptosis following treatment (Fig. 5B, bars 1 and 3; P NS).
These data indicate that endogenous levels of ARC confer
chemoresistance to primary tumors.
The ability of primary tumor cells to invade locally is an
important factor in the development of distant metastases, and
the invading cell population is known to be more chemoresistant than primary tumor cells (32). Accordingly, using the
PyMT model, we exploited the in vivo invasion assay to capture
locally invading cells, enabling us to assess the effect of ARC on
their resistance to chemotherapy. Deletion of nol3 markedly
augmented killing by doxorubicin (P < 0.05; Fig. 5C) and
tamoxifen (P < 0.001; Fig. 5D). We conclude that endogenous
levels of ARC contribute to chemoresistance of the invading
cell population.

Discussion
These results indicate that ARC, previously recognized as a
regulator of cell death solely in terminally differentiated cells
(e.g., cardiac myocytes), promotes multiple aspects of breast
carcinogenesis. This conclusion is supported by experiments in
both genetically manipulated mice and xenografts of human
breast cancer cells. Importantly, our studies emphasize genetic
loss of function to provide insight into the importance of
endogenous ARC levels.
Our previous discovery that ARC abundance is markedly
increased in human breast cancers is recapitulated in mammary
tumors of MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice (Fig. 1). On the basis of
prior studies (18), we presume that ARC levels are increased, in
part, through upregulation of Ras signaling by the PyMT transgene (35). The persistence of ARC from primary tumors through
metastases in this model is in accordance with our results
showing involvement of ARC in pathogenesis at multiple stages.
In fact, ARC expression is even higher in the invading cell
population than in corresponding primary mammary tumors
of PyMT mice (unpublished data, S. Goswami and J. Condeelis).
Onset and multiplicity of PyMT tumors are unaffected by
the loss of ARC suggesting that ARC is not necessary for
tumor initiation. Rather, our data indicate that ARC strongly
inﬂuences tumor growth (Fig. 2C). Despite its known function
as an apoptosis inhibitor, the absence of ARC does not
signiﬁcantly increase apoptosis in this system (Fig. 2D).
Although the explanation for this is not clear, we hypothesize
the presence of redundant cell death inhibitors. Surprisingly,
the absence of ARC reduces cellular proliferation (Fig. 2E).
This proliferation function of ARC has not been previously
described, although we have recently observed that ARC
knockdown/knockout also impairs the proliferation of

www.aacrjournals.org

benign MCF-10A breast epithelial cells (unpublished data,
C. Medina-Ramirez and R. Kitsis) and hypoxic pulmonary
arterial smooth muscle cells in vivo (27). The mechanism of
ARC-induced cellular proliferation is not known. Although
the ability of ARC to inactivate p53 may be involved (11), this
explanation is less likely in PyMT tumors in which activated
Akt (35) would be predicted to have already decreased p53
levels through MDM2-mediated degradation (36).
ARC does not inﬂuence the kinetics with which lung metastases develop in the PyMT model. Rather, the number of lung
metastases in PyMT mice lacking ARC is markedly reduced
suggesting decreases in the efﬁciency of this process. The
mechanisms by which ARC affects invasion and metastasis
seem complex. Absence of ARC reduces local invasion, blood
burden (reﬂecting the balance between intravasation and
extravasation), and metastasis by similar amounts (40%–
44%; Fig. 3A–C), implying that the most proximal event,
invasion, may play the rate-limiting role. Of note, signiﬁcant
effects of ARC on invasion were observed in all systems studied
[PyMT; (Fig. 3A), met-1 (Fig. 3E), and LM2 (Fig. 4D)]. Although
the mechanisms by which ARC facilitates invasion are unclear,
emerging evidence suggests that other cell death regulators
(e.g., procaspase-8, IAPs, Bcl-2) may promote invasion by
effects independent of their apoptosis functions (37–41). Procaspase-8, in particular, promotes migration and metastasis
through interactions with a focal adhesion kinase (FAK) complex (40, 41). Because ARC and procaspase-8 interact (8, 9) we
tested the possibility that the effects of ARC on invasion involve
procaspase-8, but found no evidence in support of this model
(K. Bacos and D. Stupack, not shown). In addition to the effects
of ARC on invasion, administration of cancer cells by tail vein
to bypass invasion and intravasation steps still shows that ARC
increases the efﬁciency of lung metastasis (Fig. 3F). A large
proportion of injected cells are known to die rapidly in the
circulation and/or the lung parenchyma (42). This lack of
persistence limits the ability of these cells to form macrometastases. Accordingly, it is likely that ARC confers a postintravasation survival advantage that increases the efﬁciency
lung metastasis. These data suggest that ARC regulates invasion and metastasis at multiple steps.
The effects of ARC on tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis observed in the PyMT model were reproduced using LM2
xenografts (Fig. 4). The signiﬁcance of this is 2-fold. First, these
experiments translate our ﬁndings in mouse cells to a humanized model of breast cancer. Second, these data indicate that
ARC exerts cell autonomous effects in mammary carcinogenesis, a conclusion that could not be drawn from PyMT mice
that lack ARC in nontumor and tumor cells.
We have shown that ARC confers resistance to killing by
doxorubicin using human Hs578T (12) and LM2 (Fig. 5A) cells.
The LM2 xenografts provide a useful preclinical model to test
the contributions of ARC to chemoresistance in vivo. Endogenous levels of ARC by themselves are sufﬁcient to render cells of
the primary tumor resistant to doxorubicin-induced death (Fig.
5B). In this situation, the antiapoptosis function of ARC is clearly
involved. The increased chemoresistance of the invading cell
population (32) poses an particularly challenging barrier to
effective treatment. Our experiments, in which cells captured

in the process of invading are tested for their sensitivities to
doxorubicin and tamoxifen, show that ARC is a critical factor in
the chemoresistance of this population (Fig. 5C and D).
In conclusion, ARC promotes multiple aspects of breast
carcinogenesis including tumorigenesis, invasion, metastasis,
and chemoresistance. Given these multiple roles, ARC may
provide a particularly potent target for future therapies directed against breast cancer.
