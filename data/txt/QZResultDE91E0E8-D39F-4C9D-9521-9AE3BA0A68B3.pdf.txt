ABSTRACT
Bladder cancer is one of the most common malignancies. However, there is
no ideal therapy to cure bladder cancer so far, especially invasive carcinoma. Here,
we developed a new antibody-based drug BCMab1-Ra, which was generated by
conjugation of BCMab1 (a new monoclonal antibody that specifically recognized the
aberrantly glycosylated Integrin a3b1 in bladder cancer) with the ricin A chain (Ra).
A patient with multiple bladder cancer received intravescical administration of BCMab1Ra treatment as a volunteer. After 30 weeks of treatment, no tumor was observed by
cystoscope examination. We did not observe any local or systemic side effects. Human
anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) was not detectable in the circulation. Results follow-up
showed no tumor had been found in every half year review in 3 years.

In July, 2011, a 57-year-old man presented to us
with gross hematuria. Cystoscope examination showed
multiple tumors on the left- bottom wall of bladder. There
were five tumors of different sizes without extensively
invading from the bladder neck, to the posterior wall, the
right lateral wall, and the apex of the bladder. The largest
is more than 5 cm, others are from 1 to 2 cm. The largest
tumor was diagnosed to be Grade III transitional cell
carcinoma (TCC) by biopsy and from the above findings,
it was diagnosed as invasive bladder tumor with a clinical
stage of T3, N0, M0.
The patient refused radical surgery and chemotherapy.
He agreed to receive intravescical infusion of BCMab1-Ra
treatment as a volunteer. The preliminary clinical study
was started under the agreements of the patient and the
institutional review board of the hospital, and informed
consent was obtained and documented in writing from the

patient. BCMab1 is a new specific monoclonal antibody
which specifically recognized the aberrantly glycosylated
Integrin a3b1 in bladder cancer [1, 2]. BCMab1-Ra was
generated by conjugation of BCMab1 with the ricin A chain
(Ra) as an immunotoxin. 2 ml BCMab1-Ra (40 mg/ml)
diluted in 40 ml normal saline (NS), and then was infused
into the bladder through a urethral catheter. The patient kept
the solution in the bladder for at least 1 hour and turned
90 degrees every 15 min. He received BCMab1-Ra weekly
for 10 weeks, then biweekly for 20 weeks. We examined the
patient’s blood chemistry and urine tests before treatment
and every week during the treatment to evaluate systemic
adverse effects.
After 4 weeks of treatment, no hematuria appeared.
26 weeks later, it’s surprising that the tumors were
disappeared by cystoscope examination. In the course of
treatment, we did not observe any local or systemic side

effects associated with administration of BCMab1-Ra
(Figure 1). Human anti-mouse antibody (HAMA) was not
detectable in the circulation. Results Follow-up showed no
tumor had been found in every half year review.
Local delivery of BCMab1-Ra can avoid many
problems associated with systemic therapy, such as (i)
absorption by the mononuclear phagocyte system (mainly
the liver and spleen) during antibody catabolism; (ii) only
a small amount of antibodies reaching the inside tumor
and (iii) localization of antibodies in normal organs and
formation of human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA).
BCMab1-Ra may serve as a novel specific antibody-based
drug for targeted therapy of bladder cancer.

None.
