Abstract
Overexpression of human ATP-binding cassette transporter
ABCG2 in cancer cells causes multidrug resistance by effluxing
anticancer drugs. ABCG2 is considered as a half transporter
and is thought to function as a homodimer. However, recent
evidence suggests that it may exist as a higher form of
oligomer consisting of 12 subunits. In this study, we mapped
the oligomerization domain of human ABCG2 to its transmembrane domain consisting of TM5-loop-TM6. This oligomerization domain, when expressed alone in HEK293 cells,
also forms a homododecamer. Furthermore, this domain has
activity that inhibits drug efflux and resistance function of the
full-length ABCG2 likely by disrupting the formation of the
homo-oligomeric full-length ABCG2. These findings suggest
that human ABCG2 may exist and work as a homo-oligomer by
interactions located in TM5-loop-TM6, and that ABCG2
oligomerization may be used as a target for therapeutic
development to circumvent ABCG2-mediated drug resistance
in cancer treatment. [Cancer Res 2007;67(9):4373–81]

Introduction
Multidrug resistance is a serious problem in cancer chemotherapy. Overexpression of some members of the ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporter superfamily causes increased efflux of anticancer
drugs, resulting in decreased intracellular accumulation of
anticancer drugs, and thus, the cancer cells can survive drug
treatment (1–5). ABCG2 is one example of these transporters that
have been shown to cause increased drug efflux and resistance
(6–9).
Unlike traditional full ABC transporters with two transmembrane domains (TMD) and two nucleotide binding domains (NBD),
ABCG2 consists of only one NBD and one TMD, with a domain
structure of NBD-TMD. It has been thought to exist and function as
a homodimer covalently linked by disulfide bonds (10–12) in the
third extracellular loop between TM5 and TM6 (13, 14). However, it
has been found recently that human ABCG2 exists in the drugresistant cells mostly as a higher form of oligomer containing 12
subunits with noncovalent interactions (15).
In this study, we delineated the oligomerization domain of
human ABCG2 and tested whether oligomerization could be
exploited as a target for intervention of ABCG2-mediated drug
resistance. We found that the domain consisting of TM5-loop-TM6

is responsible for ABCG2 oligomerization. Ectopically expressed
TM5-loop-TM6 domain exists as a dodecamer, and its coexpression inhibits ABCG2-mediated drug efflux and resistance. These
findings suggest that human ABCG2 likely exists and works as a
homo-oligomer by interactions located in TM5-loop-TM6, and that
ABCG2 oligomerization may be used as a target for therapeutic
development to circumvent ABCG2-mediated drug resistance in
cancer therapy.

Materials and Methods
Materials. Bxp-21 against ABCG2, anti-Myc and anti-HA antibodies, and
protein G-Sepharose 4B were purchased from ID Labs, Cell Signaling,
Covance, and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. G418, hygromycin,
LipofectAMINE/Opti-MEM transfection reagents were from Invitrogen.
pTK-Hyg plasmid, perfluoro-octanoic acid (PFO), protease inhibitor cocktail
tablets, disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) were from Clontech, Oakwood
Products, Roche Diagnostics, and Pierce Biotechnology, respectively. N,Ndimethyl formamide, mitoxantrone, etoposide (VP-16), 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), and Triton X-100 were
obtained from Sigma. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents, Superdex 200
HR column, thyroglobulin, ovalbumin, and RNase A were from Amersham/
Pharmacia. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, protein concentration
assay kit, and precast polyacrylamide gradient gels were from Bio-Rad. Cell
culture media and reagents were obtained from either Invitrogen or
Cambrex Bioscience. All other reagents of molecular biology grade were
purchased from Sigma or Fisher.
Engineering of HA or Myc-tagged ABCG2 constructs. All truncated
constructs were engineered by first performing a PCR to amplify the cDNA
of interest using primers carrying BamHI or EcoRI site. The PCR products
were then digested with BamHI and EcoRI and subsequently cloned into
pcDNA3, resulting in final expression constructs. All final constructs were
verified by double-strand DNA sequencing.
To engineer tagged NBD (ABCG2Myc-NBD) and TMD (ABCG2TMD-HA), we
first analyzed the amino acid sequence of human ABCG2 and found a
potential linker region between NBD and TMD, 78 amino acids downstream
of the Walker B sequence similar as that in human ABCB1. We thus
engineered these constructs by using this potential linker region as cleavage
sites. ABCG2Myc-NBD was produced by PCR using a Myc tag-encoding forward
primer containing a Bam HI site: 5¶-CGCGGATCCGCCGCCATGGAACAAAAGCTCATCTCAGAAGAAGATCTGTCTTCCAGTAATGTCGAAGTT-3¶
and a reverse primer containing an EcoRI site and a stop codon: 5¶CCGGAATTCATCAATAAATCTCCGCTAATTTTTCTATGAGTGG-3¶.
ABCG2TMD-HA was produced by PCR using a forward primer containing a
Bam HI site 5¶-CGCGGATCCGCCGCCATGAAGCCACTCATAGAAAAATTAGCGGAG-3¶ and an HA-encoding reverse primer containing an EcoRI site
and a stop codon 5¶-CCGGAATTCATCAGCTAGCATAATCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTAAGAATATTTTTTAAGAAATAAC-3¶.
ABCG2Myc-TM1-2 and ABCG2Myc-TM1-4 were cloned in the same way as
ABCG2 Myc-NBD with a Myc tag-encoding forward primer containing a BamHI
site: 5¶-CGCGGATCCGCCGCCATGGAACAAAAGCTCATCTCAGAAGAAGATCTGTCTTCCAGTAATGTCGAAGTT-3¶ and reverse primers containing
an EcoRI site and a stop codon: 5¶-CCGGAATTCATCACGTCATGGGTAATAAATCAGATAACAGTTT-3¶ ( for ABCG2Myc-TM1-2) and 5¶-CCGGAATTCATCATACAGAAACCACACTCTGACCTGCTG C-3¶ ( for ABCG2Myc-TM1-4).

ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 was engineered using PCR with a Myc-tag–encoding
forward primer containing a BamHI site 5¶-CGCGGATCCGCCGCCATGGAACAAAAGCTCATCTCAGAAGAAGATCTGGCAGCAGGTCAGAGTGTGGTTTCTGTA-3¶ and a reverse primer containing an EcoRI site
5¶-CCGGAATTCATTAAGAATATTTTTTAAGAAATAAC-3¶.
To engineer HA- and Myc-tagged full-length ABCG2s (ABCG2HA-F and
ABCG2Myc-F), cDNA fragments encoding the HA-tagged and Myc-tagged
NH2 termini were released from ABCG2HA-NBD and ABCG2Myc-TM1-4
constructs using BamHI and AocI double digestion. These fragments were
then used to replace the corresponding wild-type full-length ABCG2
sequence without tags in pcDNA3 to generate ABCG2HA-F and ABCG2Myc-F.
Cell culture and transfection. HEK293 cells were maintained at 37jC in
5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. For transient transfections,
cells at 90% confluency in 6-cm plate were transfected with 4 Ag desired
constructs using LipofectAMINE/Opti-MEM reagents. To select stable
clones, the transfected cells were grown in the presence of 0.8 mg/mL
G418. The stable clones were maintained in 0.2 mg/mL G418. To establish
stable clones with expression of two different constructs, the stable clones
selected by G418 were cotransfected with 4 Ag pTK-Hyg, together with 20 Ag
desired constructs followed by selection using 0.2 mg/mL hygromycin. The
positive double stable cell lines were maintained in 0.2 mg/mL G418 and
0.1 mg/mL hygromycin.
Cell membrane and lysate preparations. Plasma membranes were
prepared in exactly the same way as previously described (15, 16), and
the final membranes were resuspended in STBS [250 mmol/L sucrose,
150 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH, 7.5)]. For lysate preparation,
cells at 90% confluency were harvested and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer
[150 mmol/L NaCl, 25 mmol/L Tris (pH, 7.4), 1 mmol/L EDTA, 2 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100]. After 30 min incubation
at 4jC followed by brief sonication, the lysates were cleared by centrifugation
at 16,000  g for 30 min. The protein concentrations of the membranes and
lysates were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit.

Immunoprecipitation. About 400 Ag cell lysates were diluted to 1.0 mL
using the same lysis buffer (see above), then mixed with 10 AL normal
mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG), and incubated for 2 h at 4jC, followed by
addition of 40 AL Protein G-Sepharose beads and further incubation for
2 h at 4jC. The mixture was then centrifuged at 500  g for 1 min, the
supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and incubated with primary
antibodies (anti-HA, anti-Myc, or control IgG, 1:100 dilution) for z3 h at
4jC. The reaction was centrifuged again at top speed for 15 min at 4jC, and
the supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and mixed with 40 AL
Protein G-Sepharose beads and incubated overnight at 4jC with shaking.
The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed five
times with 1 mL lysis buffer each, and finally solubilized in 40 AL SDS
sample buffer for Western blot analyses as previously described (15).
Immunofluorescence staining and confocal imaging. This experiment was done as previously described (17). Briefly, 5  105 cells were
cultured for 2 days, washed twice with PBS, fixed with 0.5 mL prechilled
acetone/methanol (50:50, v/v) at room temperature for 10 min, and then
blocked with ice-cold washing buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for
30 min, followed by staining with anti-Myc antibody at 1:50 dilution for
1 h on ice. The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold washing buffer
and incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG at 1:100 dilution,
together with propidium iodide at 1:200 dilution for 1 h on ice. The staining
was imaged using a Zeiss confocal microscope.
PFO-PAGE, nondenaturing PAGE, gel filtration chromatography,
chemical cross-linking, and metabolic labeling. These experiments were
done in exactly the same way as previously described (15). The
stoichiometry of the heterocomplex was calculated using the following
formula: Mrcomplex = N Myc-TM5-6  MrMyc-TM5-6 + N HA-F  MrHA-F and
N Myc-TM5-6 + N HA-F = 12, where Mr represents apparent molecular weight,
and N represents the numbers of subunits in the heterocomplex.
Drug efflux assay. Drug efflux assay was done as described previously (18)
with some modifications. Briefly, 5  105 cells were trypsinized and washed

with PBS, resuspended in 0.5 mL PBS containing 20 Amol/L mitoxantrone,
and incubated at 37jC for 30 min. Cells were then collected by centrifugation,
washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in 0.5 mL PBS and incubated at
37jC for 1 h. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and analyzed by flow
cytometry using a Becton Dickinson FACScalibur. The data were analyzed
using Cell Quest Pro (BD Biosciences). In the negative vehicle controls, equal
volumes of ethanol, which were used to dissolve mitoxantrone, were used.
Cytotoxicity assay. The cytotoxicity was measured using MTT and colony
formation assays. MTT assay was done as previously described (19) using
different concentrations of mitoxantrone and VP-16. EC50 is defined as the
concentration of drugs required to kill 50% of the cells in the control condition
without any drugs. Relative resistance factors were determined by dividing
median EC50 of stable clones with expression of ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 (TM5-6/Vec.),
ABCG2HA-F (Vec./HA-F), or both (TM5-6/HA-F) by that of cell clones transfected with vectors only (Vec./Vec.). Colony formation assay was done as
described by Cheung et al. (20) using 17.5 nmol/L mitoxantrone or 340 nmol/L
VP-16. Efficiency of colony formation was calculated by normalizing to the
controls treated with vehicles (ethanol for mitoxantrone and DMSO for VP-16).

Results
The ABCG2 oligomerization domain is located within the
domain consisting of TM5-loop-TM6. To map the oligomeriza-

tion domain of human ABCG2, we first tested if this putative
domain is located in the amino terminal NBD or the carboxyl
terminal TMD. For this purpose, we established HEK293 cell lines
with stable expression of HA- or Myc-tagged full-length ABCG2
(ABCG2HA-F or ABCG2Myc-F; see Fig. 1A for constructs). We next
generated two constructs encoding Myc-tagged NBD with residues
M1-Y336 (ABCG2Myc-NBD) and HA-tagged TMD with residues K326S655 (ABCG2TMD-HA; Fig. 1A) and transiently transfected them into
the stable cell lines expressing ABCG2HA-F and ABCG2Myc-F,
respectively. Lysates from these cells were first tested for
coexpression of the full-length and half ABCG2 molecules using
Western blot analysis. All constructs were well expressed in
HEK293 cells (Fig. 1B). However, ABCG2TMD-HA seemed to be
smaller than the expected size likely due to its high hydrophobicity.
To rule out the possibility that the observed smaller size of
ABCG2TMD-HA was due to truncation or internal translation
initiation, we engineered and tested another construct double
tagged with Myc and HA at its amino and carboxyl termini,
respectively (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1C, the double-tagged TMD
had similar mobility as the original HA-tagged TMD. Thus, the
smaller observed size of TMD is not due to internal initiation or

truncation. It is possible that more SDS is bound to the TMD due
to its higher hydrophobicity, which would cause a faster mobility of
the TMD on SDS-PAGE.
We next did coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses
of lysates from cells coexpressing full-length and domain
constructs of ABCG2 using monoclonal anti-HA and anti-Myc
antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1D and E, ABCG2Myc-NBD did not
coimmunoprecipitate ABCG2HA-F (Fig. 1D), whereas ABCG2TMD-HA
coimmunoprecipitated ABCG2Myc-F (Fig. 1E). Thus, it is likely that
the oligomerization domain of ABCG2 is located within the TMD
but not in the NBD.
To further map the oligomerization domain, we engineered two
Myc-tagged constructs with sequential deletions of TM segments
(ABCG2Myc-TM1-4 with residues M1-V536 and ABCG2Myc-TM1-2 with
M1-T482; Fig. 2A; see also Fig. 1A). These constructs, together with
ABCG2Myc-F as a control, were transiently transfected into HEK293

cells with stable expression of ABCG2HA-F. Western blot analyses of
cell lysates (Fig. 2B) and immunofluorescence staining of whole
cells (Fig. 2C) were done to ensure the coexpression and proper
trafficking to membranes of the truncated ABCG2s, respectively. It
is noteworthy that ABCG2Myc-TM1-4 and ABCG2Myc-TM1-2 have
similar apparent mobility on SDS-PAGE despite the fact that they
have a difference of 54 amino acids in length. This may be again
due to the fact that the additional 54 amino acids (TM3 and TM4)
at the carboxyl terminus of ABCG2Myc-TM1-4 (see Fig. 2A) are mostly
hydrophobic residues, which may cause increased mobility and a
smaller apparent molecular weight than its true size, similar to the
one observed with TMD discussed above in Fig. 1. The use of high
concentration gel may also contribute to the less clear difference
between the two proteins. We next did coimmunoprecipitation and
Western blot analyses with anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies.
As shown in Fig. 2D, ABCG2Myc-F coprecipitated ABCG2HA-F and

membranes from HEK293 cells with

PFO (bottom ), and the extract was
separated by gel filtration chromatography
using Superdex column followed by TCA
precipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Western
blot analyses. The markers used were also
treated and separated the same way and
detected by a UV detector. The size of
ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 was estimated based on
linear regression of protein markers: TG,

C, chemical cross-linking. HEK293 cells
with stable ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 expression

used. D, coimmunoprecipitation. HEK293
cells with stable ABCG2Myc-TM5-6
expression were metabolically labeled
with [35S]methionine, followed by
immunoprecipitation of lysate with
anti-Myc or control IgG, separation on
SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography to detect
coprecipitated proteins. Myc antibody
was used in all Western blot analyses.

vice versa as expected, whereas neither ABCG2Myc-TM1-4 nor
ABCG2Myc-TM1-2 coprecipitated ABCG2HA-F, suggesting that deletion of the domain consisting of TM5-loop-TM6 may have removed
the oligomerization activity. It is thus possible that the oligomerization domain of human ABCG2 is located within TM5-loop-TM6.
To test this possibility, we engineered another truncated ABCG2
construct encoding only TM5-loop-TM6 (residues A528-S655) with a
Myc tag (ABCG2Myc-TM5-6; Fig. 2A, also see Fig. 1A) and did similar
experiments as described above. Figure 2B and C shows that
ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 could be successfully coexpressed with ABCG2HA-F
and properly trafficked onto plasma membranes, respectively.
ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 could also coprecipitate ABCG2HA-F and vice versa
(Fig. 2D). Thus, it is likely that the oligomerization domain of
human ABCG2 is located within TM5-loop-TM6.
The TM5-loop-TM6 domain can form a homododecamer. To
further determine if this domain indeed has oligomerization activity,
we analyzed if it can form a homo-oligomer and estimated the
number of subunits within the oligomer. For this purpose, a stable cell
line overexpressing ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 was established and subjected to
several biochemical analyses to determine its native size.
Gel filtration chromatography (Superdex) was first employed to
determine the oligomeric status of human ABCG2Myc-TM5-6
following extraction from isolated plasma membranes with 0.5%
PFO or 1% SDS as a control as previously described (15). The eluted
fractions from gel filtration were trichloroacetic acid (TCA)

www.aacrjournals.org

precipitated, separated by SDS-PAGE, and followed by Western
blot to detect ABCG2Myc-TM5-6. We found that ABCG2Myc-TM5-6
extracted by SDS was eluted in the fractions with retention volume
of 12 to 13.5 mL with an estimated average molecular weight of
f19 kDa (Fig. 3A, top; Table 1), close to that determined by SDSPAGE (Fig. 3C and D and Table 1). ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 extracted by
PFO was eluted mainly in the fraction of a retention volume of
f9 mL with an estimated molecular weight of f261 kDa (Fig. 3A,
bottom; Table 1). Assuming that ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 in SDS behaves as
a monomer, the native ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 in the peak fraction
extracted by PFO is likely a dodecamer as we previously found
for the full-length ABCG2 (15).
We next used PFO-PAGE followed by Western blot to detect
ABCG2Myc-TM5-6. This method has been used successfully in the
past for studying several membrane proteins, including native
ABCG2 (15, 21–24). As shown in Fig. 3B (lane 1), ABCG2Myc-TM5-6
extracted from isolated membranes using 0.5% PFO migrated as a
broad band on PFO-PAGE, with an estimated average molecular
weight of f226 kDa (Table 1). We also did a nondenaturing PAGE
and Western blot analysis of ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 extracted by nonionic
detergent Triton X-100 to rule out the potential problem with the
use of PFO. As shown in Fig. 3B (lane 2), ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 again
migrated mainly with a mobility of f235 kDa (Table 1). Given
that ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 in SDS has an apparent molecular weight of
f19 kDa in gel filtration and f17 kDa on SDS-PAGE (see Table 1),
ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 separated by PFO- and nondenaturing PAGE likely
represents dodecameric complexes. It should also be noted that
isolated plasma membranes were used in the above studies, and
the findings confirm our conclusion that ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 is located
on plasma membranes.
To further determine whether the dodecameric ABCG2Myc-TM5-6
exists in live cells, we conducted a chemical cross-linking
experiment of live cells using DSS as previously described (15).
Membranes were then isolated and subjected to SDS-PAGE
and Western blot analysis to detect ABCG2Myc-TM5-6. As shown
in Fig. 3C, at least five cross-linked products were detected by
anti-Myc antibody. The estimated molecular weights of these
products are 179, 94, 62, 41, and 32 kDa, which likely correspond
to dodecameric, hexameric, tetrameric, trimeric, and dimeric
ABCG2Myc-TM5-6, respectively (see Table 1). The un–cross-linked
monomeric ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 has an apparent molecular weight of
f17 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3C). It should be noted that the minor
lower monomeric band (possibly a degradation product, see
Discussion) disappeared following cross-linking. It is possible that
it became undetectable following cross-linking due to its relatively
low abundance and conversion to cross-linked molecules.
To test whether the oligomeric ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 is homogeneous,
we did immunoprecipitation assay following metabolic labeling
with [35S]methionine of the cells with stable expression of
ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 and lysis of cells with Triton X-100. As shown
in Fig. 3D, no additional proteins were coprecipitated with
ABCG2Myc-TM5-6, suggesting that ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 is likely a homooligomer.
Coexpression of the TM5-loop-TM6 domain inhibits ABCG2
functions. As shown above, ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 is expressed on
plasma membranes, contains the oligomerization domain, and can
interact with the full-length ABCG2. It is of interest to determine if
ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 inhibits ABCG2 function by interacting with the
full-length ABCG2 and competing for oligomerization. We first
tested if coexpression of ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 inhibits ABCG2-mediated
drug resistance. For this purpose, stable cell clones expressing both

ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 and ABCG2HA-F and vector control clones were
first established using double selection as described in Materials
and Methods. Figure 4A shows the expression of ABCG2Myc-TM5-6
and ABCG2HA-F, together or alone with vector controls as
determined by Western blot analysis. We next did drug resistance
analysis using MTT assay with anticancer drugs mitoxantrone and
VP-16. As shown in Fig. 4B, the cells expressing ABCG2HA-F alone
(Vec./HA-F) are significantly more resistant to both drugs tested
than the cells transfected with vector controls alone (Vec./Vec.) or
cells expressing only ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 (TM5-6/Vec.). However, the
resistance to these drugs due to ABCG2HA-F expression was
significantly decreased by coexpressing ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 (TM5-6/
HA-F). These observations were further confirmed when colony
formation assay was used. As shown in Fig. 4C, coexpression of

ABCG2HA-F together (Myc-TM5-6/HA-F ) or alone (Myc-TM5-6/Vec. and Vec./
HA-F ) and control vectors (Vec./Vec .) were subjected to Western blot analyses
of lysates for expression (A ), MTT assay for relative resistance factors to
mitoxantrone and VP-16 (B), and colony formation assay (C ).

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (9). May 1, 2007

ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 significantly reduced the number of colonies
formed by the resistant cells (Vec./HA-F) in the presence of
anticancer drugs mitoxantrone or VP-16.
To determine if the inhibition of drug resistance by ABCG2Myc-TM5-6
was due to its effect on ABCG2-mediated drug efflux, we employed
the established fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis
for mitoxantrone efflux. We first transiently transfected 2 Ag of the
untagged full-length ABCG2 (ABCG2F) into HEK293 cells with stable
expression of ABCG2Myc-TM5-6, followed by testing the drug efflux
activity of the transiently transfected ABCG2F 48 h after transfection.
Figure 5A shows the expression of ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 and ABCG2F
together or alone and control cells transfected with vectors as
determined by Western blot analyses. Figure 5B shows typical
profiles of mitoxantrone efflux in these cells as determined by FACS.
As expected, the cells harboring vectors alone (Vec./Vec.) or
expressing only ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 (TM5-6/Vec.) have the highest level
of mitoxantrone accumulation (less effluxed), whereas the cells
expressing only ABCG2F (Vec./F) have the lowest level of drug accumulation (more effluxed). Interestingly, the cells expressing both
ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 and ABCG2F (TM5-6/F) have intermediate levels
of mitoxantrone accumulation, suggesting that the mitoxantrone
efflux activity of ABCG2F has been tampered by coexpressing
ABCG2Myc-TM5-6, and thereby, the cells have more drugs accumulated
compared with the cells expressing only ABCG2F. We also did
another negative control experiment using ABCG2Myc-TM1-4 and
found that it, similar to the vector, had no effect on ABCG2Fmediated mitoxantrone efflux (data not shown). Thus, most likely,
the effect of ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 on ABCG2F-mediated drug efflux is due
to its direct interaction with the full-length ABCG2.
We next conducted an assay using cells transiently transfected
with different amounts of ABCG2F cDNA into stable clones
expressing ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 to determine the dose response by
elevating the ABCG2F expression level. We did not perform the
transient transfection of ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 into cells with stable
expression of ABCG2F because of concerns that the efficiency of
transient transfection of ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 would be low, and many
cells that have the stable expression of ABCG2F would not have been
transfected by ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 and, thus, affecting the outcome and
interpretation. On the other hand, transfecting ABCG2F into cells
with stable expression of ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 will help ensure every cell
that has ABCG2F will also have ABCG2Myc-TM5-6. Figure 5C shows
the differential expression of ABCG2F in stable clones harboring
vector control (lane 1) or ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 (lanes 2–4). Figure 5D
shows that 10 Ag ABCG2F-transfected cells in the presence of
ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 [TM5-6/F(10)] had only the same level of efflux
activity compared with the 2-Ag ABCG2F-transfected cells in the
absence of ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 [Vec/F(2)], although the former had f3fold ABCG2F, suggesting that the efflux activity of ABCG2F was
severely inhibited by coexpressing ABCG2Myc-TM5-6. Hence, we
conclude that the domain consisting of TM5-loop-TM6 can inhibit
the drug efflux and resistance function of ABCG2, and that this
inhibition is likely dose-dependent.
TM5-loop-TM6 domain competes for oligomerization with
full-length ABCG2. We have shown above that the coexpression of
the TM5-loop-TM6 domain inhibits the function of ABCG2 (Figs. 4
and 5), and that it interacts with ABCG2 by coimmunoprecipitation
(Fig. 3). To further determine if the coexpression of TM5-loop-TM6
domain affects the homo-oligomerization of full-length ABCG2, we
characterized hetero-oligomers in the stable cell clone that
coexpresses both ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 and ABCG2HA-F using gel
filtration chromatography (Superose) as described previously (15).

Targeting ABCG2 Oligomerization for Chemosensitization

Figure 5. Inhibitory effect of
ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 on drug efflux activity of
full-length ABCG2. HEK293 cells stably
transfected with vector or ABCG2Myc-TM5-6
were subjected to transient transfection
with vector and various amounts of
full-length ABCG2, followed by Western
blot analyses of cell lysate for expression
(A and C ) or FACS analysis of
mitoxantrone efflux for transport activity
of ABCG2 (B and D).

As shown in Fig. 6A, ABCG2HA-F alone in Triton X-100 was eluted
in fractions of 10.5 to 13.5 mL, with an estimated average molecular weight of f854 kDa, which corresponds to dodecamer,
consistent with our previous findings (15). When coexpressed with
ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 in a stable cell clone, the elution of ABCG2HA-F
shifted to the right in fractions of 12 to 14 mL, with an estimated
average molecular weight of f476 kDa (Fig. 6B). This observation
suggests that the ABCG2HA-F complex in the presence of
ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 likely contains the smaller ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 subunit.
This was confirmed by testing these fractions with myc antibody for
the coexistence of ABCG2Myc-TM5-6. As shown in Fig. 6C, most
coexpressed ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 was separated in fractions of 13 to
14 mL, with an average molecular weight of f371 kDa. However,
ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 alone was eluted mainly with retentions of 14.5 to
15.5 mL, with an average molecular weight of f148 kDa (Fig. 6D).
Based on these observations, we conclude that coexpression of
ABCG2HA-F and ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 generated hetero-complexes consisting of both ABCG2HA-F and ABCG2Myc-TM5-6. Using the estimated
molecular weight of f15 kDa for ABCG2HA-TM5-6 separated by
Superose in SDS (Table 1), the estimated ABCG2HA-F molecular
weight of 72 kDa (25) and the estimated average molecular weight
of 371 kDa for the heterocomplex (Fig. 6C and Table 1), we
calculated that the average stoichiometry of the heterocomplexes is
3 ABCG2HA-F+ 9 ABCG2Myc-TM5-6, with a range from 5 ABCG2HA-F+ 7
ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 (Fig. 6C, fraction 13 mL) to 2 ABCG2HA-F+ 10
ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 (Fig. 6C, fraction 14 mL).

Discussion
ABCG2 is an important drug efflux pump causing drug
resistance when overexpressed in cancer cells. It has been
suggested that ABCG2 exists as a homodimer and possibly as a

www.aacrjournals.org

homododecamer. However, the oligomerization domain remained
elusive. In this study, we have successfully mapped the oligomerization domain of ABCG2 to TM5-loop-TM6 (ABCG2Myc-TM5-6) and
showed that ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 alone can form a homododecamer,
and it can inhibit the drug efflux and resistance function of human
ABCG2.
Although each method generated slightly different results, the
estimated size of domain ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 complex was very large
(148–261 kDa; see Table 1), and the complex was estimated to
consist of 10 to 14 subunits calculated based on the size of
monomeric proteins determined in each respective method. The
highest oligomeric form that can be chemically cross-linked had an
apparent size of f179 kDa. Considering that the oligomeric
ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 seemed to be homogeneous (Fig. 3D) and that the
size determination by these methods is only an estimate, we
conclude that the ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 may be a homododecamer
consisting of 12 ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 subunits. This conclusion further
supports that human ABCG2 is likely a homododecamer and
confirms that the interactions between ABCG2 subunits are likely
located within the domain containing TM5-loop-TM6.
We also observed that ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 seems to be a doublet
on SDS-PAGE in most cases, especially when expressed alone (see
Fig. 6D). The doublet disappears in other cases, especially when it
is coexpressed with the full-length ABCG2 (see Fig. 6C). The reason
for these differences is currently unknown. It is, however, possible
that the oligomerization with the full-length molecule may help the
maturation and stabilization of ABCG2Myc-TM5-6.
Recently, the intermolecular disulfide bond of ABCG2 has been
localized to the extracellular loop (Cys603) linking TM5 and TM6
(13, 14), suggesting that this loop is likely involved in intersubunit
interactions. Our finding, that the domain including TM5-loopTM6 contains oligomerization activity, is consistent with these

previous observations. However, because the intermolecular
disulfide bond is only for the dimeric formation as previously
shown (13, 14), the finding that ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 could form a
homododecamer suggests that the domain containing TM5-loopTM6 is likely also involved in other types of noncovalent proteinprotein interactions. Indeed, it has recently been found that a Gly
residue (G553) in TM5 is potentially involved in ABCG2 oligomerization (26).
The GXXXG motif in transmembrane segments has been shown
responsible for oligomerization of membrane proteins (27, 28), and
such a motif has been found in TM1, but not in TM5 and TM6, of

ABCG2. However, removal of this motif in TM1 by site-directed
mutagenesis did not abolish oligomerization of ABCG2, suggesting
that the GXXXG motif in TM1 does not play an essential role
in ABCG2 oligomerization (29). This conclusion is supported by
our current finding that the truncated ABCG2 containing TM1 to
TM4 (ABCG2Myc-TM1-4) did not contain an oligomerization domain
(Fig. 2).
Several other motifs, such as AXXXA, AXXXG, GXXXXXXG, and
QXXS, have been suggested to involve interactions between
membrane proteins (28, 30, 31). Examination of the sequence of
the domain containing TM5-loop-TM6 of human ABCG2 revealed
that they contain only the QXXS motif (Q569YFS) in the loop linking
TM5 and TM6. This sequence is completely conserved between the
human and mouse ABCG2s. Examination of other members of the
ABCG subfamily showed that human ABCG1 (Q594WMS) and
ABCG4 (Q563WSS) and mouse ABCG1 (Q583WMS) and ABCG4
(Q563WSS) all have the QXXS motif in their loops linking TM5 and
TM6. However, human ABCG5 and ABCG8 were found to have only
Q568KYCS and Q607FS in their loops linking TM5 and TM6,
although both have been shown to form heterodimers (32).
Whether the QXXS motif is involved in oligomerization of ABCG2
and other ABCG subfamily members and whether the semiconserved motif Q568KYCS and Q607FS in ABCG5 and ABCG8 are
important for their heterodimerization await further investigations.
We also found that ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 has an inhibitory effect on
the function of the full-length human ABCG2 in both drug
resistance and efflux. This effect may be due to the incorporation
of ABCG2Myc-TM5-6 into the complex by competing for ABCG2F
subunits. This finding also suggests that the oligomerization of
ABCG2 may be used as a target to develop therapeutics for treating
drug-resistant human cancers. Small molecules that mimic the
oligomerization domain and are able to disrupt oligomerization of
ABCG2 may be developed as therapeutics in the future to
circumvent ABCG2-mediated drug resistance in cancer treatment.
