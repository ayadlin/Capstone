ABSTRACT:
Forkhead transcription factors (FOXO) are downstream targets of the
phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) protein kinase B (PKB) signaling cascade and play
a pivotal role in cell differentiation, cell cycle and apoptosis. We found that cells
from prednisone-resistant T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients showed
cytoplasmic localization of FOXO3 in comparison to prednisone-sensitive patients
suggesting its inactivation. To determine the impact of FOXO3, T-ALL cells were
infected with a 4OH-tamoxifen-regulated, phosphorylation-independent FOXO3(A3)
ERtm allele. After FOXO3-activation these cells undergo caspase-dependent apoptosis.
FOXO3 induces the death ligand TRAIL and the BH3-only protein Noxa implicating
extrinsic as well as intrinsic death signaling. Whereas dnFADD partially inhibited
cell death, CrmA and dnBID efficiently rescued ALL cells after FOXO3 activation,
suggesting a caspase-8 amplifying feedback loop downstream of FADD. Knockdown
of TRAIL and Noxa reduced FOXO3-induced apoptosis, implicating that mitochondrial
destabilization amplifies TRAIL-signaling. The-reconstitution of the cell cycle inhibitor
p16INK4A, which sensitizes ALL cells to mitochondria-induced cell death, represses
FOXO3 protein levels and reduces the dependency of these leukemia cells on PI3KPKB signaling. This suggests that if p16INK4A is deleted during leukemia development,
FOXO3 levels elevate and FOXO3 has to be inactivated by deregulation of the PI3KPKB pathway to prevent FOXO3-induced cell death.

INTRODUCTION

[2]. Due to deregulation of the PI3K-PKB pathway,
these transcription factors are inactivated in the majority
of human malignancies, either through hyperactivation
of PKB itself or due to the loss of inhibitors of the
PI3K-signaling, such as PTEN [3]. In 50-75% of
T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients a
hyperactivation of the PI3K-PKB pathway is found, which
is predictive for a poor clinical outcome [4]. The reasons
for PKB activation are not completely clarified as neither

Forkhead transcription factors (FOXO) are
downstream targets of the phosphoinositol-3-kinase
(PI3K) protein kinase B-(PKB)-signaling pathway [1].
The FOXO subfamily consists of four members (FOXO1,
FOXO3, FOXO4, and FOXO6), which regulate cell type
specific apoptosis, cell cycle arrest or stress responses

mutations of the PI3K or the PKB are associated with ALL
nor mutations of tyrosine kinases like BRC-ABL or FLT3ITD are relevant for PKB activation in leukemia [5].
One explanation for PKB hyperactivation might be
that T-ALL cells frequently carry a heterozygous deletion
of the PTEN gene locus [6], which leads to increased
PI3K-PKB signaling and thereby inactivation of the
PKB target FOXO3 in leukemia cells. Inactivation of
the PTEN locus correlates with increased proliferation
and replicative senescence [7], leukemogenesis [8]
and predicts relapse in childhood ALL [9]. Inhibitors
of the PI3K-PKB pathway, which induce apoptosis in
different leukemia cells are already in the focus of several
preclinical studies but the critical target in this network has
not been discovered yet [4, 10].
FOXO3 was shown to play a crucial role in
controlling cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and self-renewal of
haematopoietic progenitor cells [11, 12] and to act as a
barrier to hematopoietic transformation which is overcome
by activation of PI3K/PKB signaling [13-15]. Deletion of
FOXO family members in mice leads to the development
of T-cell lymphoma, demonstrating that the PKB-FOXO
axis is involved in tumor development [16]. Active
FOXO3, however, regulates apoptosis signaling cell type
specific by induction of the BH3-only proteins PMAIP1/
Noxa and BCL2L11/Bim [17, 18], or by induction of the
death ligands TRAIL or FASL [1, 19]. FOXO3 indirectly
interferes with the balance of pro-and anti-apoptotic BCL2
proteins by the induction of B-cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl6),
which represses the anti-apoptotic protein BCL2L1/BclxL
[20].
Apoptosis is initiated either by binding of so called
death ligands, such as FASL or TRAIL to their cognate
receptors resulting in formation of the death-inducing
signaling complex (DISC) and activation of CASP8/
caspase-8, or via the intrinsic death pathway. The intrinsic
death pathway is controlled at the level of mitochondria
by members of the BCL2 family. This protein family is
divided into anti-apoptotic members, such as BCL2,
BclxL or MCL1, the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins
(such as Noxa, Bim or BBC3/Puma) and the proapoptotic multi-domain proteins BAX, BAK and Bok.
The balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins (BCL2
rheostat) regulates mitochondrial membrane potential. If
damaged, Cytochrome c is released from mitochondria
and triggers the formation of the apoptosome, which leads
to subsequent activation of CASP9/caspase-9. Two models
have been discussed how BH3-only proteins induce
cell death. The first model describes activators of BAX
and BAK, like Bid and Bim, and sensitizers like Noxa
which bind to anti-apoptotic proteins and thereby release
activator BH3-only proteins as well as BAX and BAK
[21]. The second model implies that the main function of
the anti-apoptotic BCL2 proteins is to sequester BAX and
BAK and to prevent their insertion into the mitochondrial
membrane. BH3-only proteins thereby displace BAX and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

BAK by binding with different affinity to BCL2 proteins.
The BH3-only protein BID connects the extrinsic
and intrinsic signaling, because it is cleaved by active
caspase-8 and then inserts into the outer mitochondrial
membrane where it antagonizes the function of the prosurvival BCL2 proteins. In some cell types (so called
type II cells) extrinsic death signaling always involves
amplification of the death signal via mitochondria, since
overexpression of either BCL2 or BclxL prevents TRAILinduced apoptosis in CEM cells [22]. This is caused by
reduced DISC formation in type II cells compared to type
I cells, were extrinsic signaling directly activates CASP3/
caspase-3, independent of mitochondrial involvement.
In this study we investigated whether therapy
resistance in childhood T-ALL cells correlates with
inactivation of FOXO3. We uncovered, that FOXO3
activates apoptosis by induction of TRAIL and Noxa
and found that the expression of the frequently mutated
tumor suppressor p16INK4A in T-ALL represses endogenous
FOXO3, suggesting that these two tumor suppressor
proteins cooperate to prevent childhood leukemia.

RESULTS
Cellular FOXO3-localization correlates with a
therapy-resistant T-ALL phenotype.
Deregulation of the PI3K/PKB/FOXO3 pathway
was shown to be involved in cancer development and
contributes to therapy resistance of different malignancies.
Bone marrow cells from pediatric T-ALL patient samples
were divided into good responders to initial prednisone
therapy (PGR) and prednisone poor responders (PPR)
and were analyzed by immunofluorescence for FOXO3
expression and subcellular localization. As shown in Fig
1, cells from PGR patients demonstrate a predominantly
nuclear localization of FOXO3 in comparison to PPR.
This partial activation of FOXO3 might sensitize these
cells to further, apoptosis-inducing therapies and thereby
contribute to a positive therapy response.

Ectopic FOXO3 induces Caspase-dependent cell
death in T-ALL.
As FOXO3 activation leads to apoptosis induction
in haematopoietic cells [11, 12], we investigated whether
FOXO3 inactivation in PPR ALL cells may account for
therapy resistance and apoptosis inhibition. To analyze the
function of FOXO3 in ALL cells, we infected different
T-ALL-cells lines (CEM, Jurkat, Molt3 and Molt4)
with a retrovirus coding for a PKB-phosphorylationindependent, estrogen receptor FOXO3(A3)ERtm fusion
protein. The expression of the fusion protein was verified
by immunoblot (Fig 2A and supplemental Fig. 1A).

FOXO3 induces death regulators of the intrinsic
and the extrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway.

Activation of FOXO3 by treatment with 4-OH-tamoxifen
(4OHT) in CEM/FOXO3 cells for 24 hours increases the
number of AnnexinV positive cells (48.7%) which was
associated with the loss of the mitochondrial potential
(39.1%) as measured by CMXRos staining (Fig 2B and
supplemental Fig. 1B). Apoptosis induction was also
determined by propidium iodide (PI)-FACS analyses of
fragmented nuclei, where FOXO3 activation by 4OHT
increases the number of apoptotic cells to 31.1% and
52.1% apoptotic cells within 24 and 48 hours, respectively
(Fig 2C). In Jurkat/FOXO3, Molt3/FOXO3 and Molt4/
FOXO3 cells treatment with 4OHT induces cell death up
to 27.4% (supplemental Fig. 1C). Apoptosis induction was
efficiently blocked by the pan-caspase inhibitor qVD-OPH
(10 µM), which reduced FOXO3-induced apoptosis from
31.3% to 3.7% after 24 hours and from 52.1 to 3.1% after
48 hours. This indicates that FOXO3 induces caspasedependent cell death in T-ALL leukemia cells (Fig 2C).

Depending on the cell type FOXO3 induces cell
cycle arrest by elevating the expression of the cell cycle
inhibitors p27Kip1 and/or p21Cip1 [23, 24] or triggers
apoptosis. FOXO3 targets include death ligands of the
extrinsic death machinery, like TRAIL or FASL [1, 19]
or members controlling the intrinsic death pathway like
Bim, Noxa or BIRC5/Survivin [17, 18, 25]. To identify
the main signaling pathway underlying FOXO3-induced
apoptosis in T-ALL cells, we generated CEM/FOXO3
cells overexpressing either anti-apoptotic members of the
BCL2 family (BCL2, BclxL), inhibitors of the extrinsic
death pathway (caspase-inhibitor CrmA, dominantnegative FADD) or a mutated version of the BH3-only
protein BID (dnBID) that cannot be cleaved by caspases
[26]. The stable ectopic expression of these proteins was
analyzed by immunoblot (Fig 3A and supplemental Fig.

Figure 1: FOXO3 localizes to the cytoplasm in bone marrow cells from prednisone-resistant T-ALL pediatric patients.

Bone marrow cells from pediatric T-ALL patients sensitive (PGR) or resistant (PPR) to prednisone were fixed before treatment in 4%
formaldehyde. FOXO3 expression was visualized with a specific rabbit monoclonal antibody against FOXO3, followed by the addition of
ALEXA488 (green) labeled anti-rabbit antisera. DAPI (blue) was applied to visualize the nuclei. Images were acquired by the videoconfocal
system ViCo microscope Nikon Eclipse 80i (Nikon, Japan). The shown stainings are representative for three PGR and three PPR patients.

1D). We then assessed how inhibition of different steps
of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis execution affects
cleavage of caspase-8, -9, and -3 (Fig 3B). CEM/FOXO3
cells and sublines ectopically expressing BCL2, dnFADD,
dnBID and CrmA were treated with 50 nM 4OHT for
18 hours and cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot
analyses (Fig 3B). Whereas BCL2 and dnFADD only
partially reduced cleavage of caspase-8, -9, and 3,
CrmA and dnBID effectively lowered caspase-8, -9 and
-3-processing and BclxL completely blocked cleavage of
all three caspases, suggesting that apoptosis initiation most
likely occurs upstream of mitochondria possibly involving
additional, FADD-independent pathways.
To analyze how the inhibition of key-steps in
extrinsic and intrinsic death signaling affects cell survival
of T-ALL during FOXO3 activation, we measured

the number of apoptotic cells by FACS-analyse of PIstained nuclei. FOXO3 activation by 4OHT induced
47% apoptosis after 24 hours – the expression of CrmA
(CEM/FOXO3-CrmA) and dnBID (CEM/FOXO3dnBID) reduced the apoptosis rate to 15.2% and 14.5%,
respectively. Overexpression of BclxL prevented apoptotic
cell death almost completely (11.5%), whereas transgenic
BCL2 lowered cell death to 25.3% and dnFADD reduced
apoptosis by 10% (Fig 3C). Also in Jurkat/FOXO3,
Molt3/FOXO3 and Molt4/FOXO3 cells, BclxL efficiently
prevented FOXO3-induced apoptosis (supplemental Fig.
1E). These differences in the inhibitory effects of the
various anti-apoptotic proteins can be explained by the
weaker overexpression of the mutated FADD molecule
compared to the endogenous FADD or by caspase-8
activation independent of DISC formation.

phosphatidylserin was analyzed by AnnexinV staining and loss of mitochondrial activity was detected by CMXRos staining (B). CEM/Ctr
and CEM/FOXO3 cells were treated with 4OHT (50 nM) and/or the caspase inhibitor qVD (10 µM) for 24 and 48 hours. Apoptosis was

was not regulated (Fig 4A, left panel and supplemental
Fig. 2), suggesting again extrinsic death receptor
signaling. The BH3-only proteins Noxa and Bim where
only slightly induced (4 fold and 1.6 fold, respectively)
whereas other FOXO-targets such as Puma were not
regulated at all (Fig 4A, middle and right panel and data
not shown). The elevated expression of TRAIL, Noxa
and Bim was also detectable on protein levels, although
only the splice-variant BimL but not BimEL was induced
after treatment with 4OHT (Fig 4B). To analyze whether
the induction of TRAIL, Bim or Noxa was sufficient for
cell death by FOXO3, we next performed knockdown
experiments using stable expression of short-hairpin
RNAs against TRAIL, Noxa or Bim. The efficiency of
mRNA knockdown was verified by quantitative RTPCR after treatment with 50 nM 4OHT for 4 hours (Fig
4C). Due to the strong induction of TRAIL by FOXO3
activation, TRAIL specific short-hairpin RNAs could
not fully prevent TRAIL induction but reduced it to less
than 50% of CEM/FOXO3-shCtr cells (Fig 4C, upper
panel). The induction of Bim or Noxa by FOXO3 was
almost completely inhibited by either Bim- or Noxaspecific short-hairpin RNAs (Fig 4C, middle and lower
panel). PI-FACS analyses revealed that knockdown of
TRAIL and Noxa efficiently reduced FOXO3-induced

apoptosis, whereas knockdown of Bim did not reduce
FOXO3-induced apoptosis. This observation suggests that
FOXO3-induced apoptosis involves a concerted activation
of extrinsic and intrinsic death signaling (Fig 4D), where
Noxa acts as a mitochondrial sensitizer to apoptosis.

Expression of p16INK4A represses FOXO3 and
reduces dependency on the PI3K/PKB signaling.
We have shown before that loss of the INK4A
gene changes the sensitivity of leukemia cells to certain
apoptotic stimuli, such as glucocorticoid- or FASinduced apoptosis [27, 28]. Re-introduction of p16INK4A
sensitizes leukemia cells to mitochondrial cell death by
changing the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL2
proteins at the mitochondria [28]. Since FOXO3-induced
cell death involves BH3-only proteins and causes loss
of the mitochondrial potential (Fig 2B), we analyzed
whether expression and activity of p16INK4A and FOXO3
might be connected in ALL cells. As shown in Fig
5A the conditional reconstitution of p16INK4A induces
cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and represses FOXO3
steady state expression levels within 24 hours (Fig
5B). This suggests that p16INK4A reconstitution may shut

Figure 6: Model for FOXO3-induced apoptosis in T-ALL. Our data suggest that the FOXO3 targets TRAIL and the BH3-only

protein Noxa are critical for cell death induction. As dnFADD only partially inhibited FOXO3-induced cell death, an additional apoptosis
signal might be triggered via TRADD/RIP/TRAF2 and NF-κB, leading then to cleavage of caspase-8 and activation of tBID independent
of FADD. FOXO3-induced expression of Noxa on the other hand may partially sequester anti-apoptotic BCL2 proteins such as MCL1,
BclxL and BCL2 and thereby sensitize mitochondria to tBID. The concerted impact of both apoptotic stimuli at mitochondria thereby will
cause activation of BAX/BAK, loss of outer mitochondrial membrane integrity, Cytochrome c release and caspase-9 and -3 activation.
Cleavage of caspase-8 by small amounts of caspase-9 may further amplify this death circuit eventually leading to Cytochrome c release
and apoptosis.

down death sensitivity mediated by FOXO3 in T-ALL.
Inhibition of the PI3K by the small compound inhibitor
Ly294002 induces programmed cell death (54%, Fig
5C), which coincides with loss of PKB-phosphorylation
at serine-473 (data not shown) and nuclear accumulation
of FOXO3 (Supplemental Fig. 3A). The expression of
p16INK4A lowered Ly294002-induced cell death from
54% to 27%, suggesting that p16INK4A expression reduces
the PI3K survival signaling dependency of T-ALL
cells (Fig 5C, right panel). To analyze whether altered
FOXO3 expression is critical for this effect, we infected
CEM/p16 cells with an ECFP-tagged wild-type FOXO3
construct to compensate for the reduction of endogenous
FOXO3 during p16INK4A expression. The expression of
ECFP-FOXO3 was verified by live cell microscopy (Fig
5C, left panel). Ectopic expression of FOXO3 almost
completely neutralized the protective effect of p16INK4A
and increased Ly294002-induced cell death from 27%
to 47% in p16INK4A-expressing cells. To study whether
p16INK4A also modulates downstream signaling of FOXO3
in T-ALL cells, we infected CEM/p16 cells with the PKBphosphorylation-independent FOXO3(A3)ER fusion
protein and validated the expression by immunoblot (Fig
5D, left panel). To analyze apoptosis sensitivity CEM/
FOXO3(A3)ER and CEM/p16-FOXO3(A3)ER cells
were treated with 250 ng/ml doxycycline (doxy) for 24
hours and then the cells were treated with 50 nM 4OHT
for another 36 hours to activate FOXO3. Combined
treatment of CEM/p16-FOXO3(A3)ER cells with doxy
and 4OHT increased cell death from 60.8% to 86.6%,
implying that p16INK4A expression accelerated FOXO3
apoptosis signaling. This is most likely due to the impact
of p16INK4A on the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL2
proteins at the mitochondria [28]. Therefore, p16INK4A
sensitizes T-ALL cells to apoptotic stimuli and in parallel
efficiently represses FOXO3 steady state levels to reduce
the detrimental effects of the pro-apoptotic FOXO3-targets
Noxa and TRAIL.

transgene efficiently induces apoptosis (Fig 2A-C). We
demonstrated that FOXO3 induces apoptosis via Bim
and Noxa in neuroblastoma cells, where PKB signaling
is also frequently deregulated [18]. Since T-ALL cells
showed reduced DISC formation after extrinsic death
signaling [22] we hypothesized that FOXO3 activation
may involve components of the intrinsic death machinery.
Ectopic expression of BclxL completely blocked FOXO3induced apoptosis, supporting the model of mitochondriainduced cell death (Fig 3C), whereas BCL2 only partially
rescued CEM cells from FOXO3-induced apoptosis. This
may be caused by insufficient expression and/or stability
of the transgene (Fig 3A) or the loss of high-expressing
cells by BCL2-driven G1 arrest [30]. Dominant-negative
FADD reduced FOXO3-induced apoptosis by 10%,
which suggests that TRAIL may activate additional
death-signaling pathways independent of FADD (Fig
3B). The caspase-8 inhibitor CrmA and dnBID not only
completely blocked apoptosis, but also prevented the
cleavage of caspase-9 (Fig 3B-C). This argues against a
possible amplification loop via caspase-9 and caspase-8
after mitochondrial depolarization as the main cause of
caspase-8 cleavage and suggests that TRAIL triggers
caspase-8 cleavage at least in part FADD-independently.
TRAIL can activate NF-κB signaling via recruitment of
TRADD leading to either survival or apoptosis, which
depends on activation of specific subunits of NF-κB
[31, 32]. The strong induction of TRAIL after FOXO3
activation was also seen on mRNA and protein level (Fig
4A-B). The BH3-only protein Noxa was strongly induced
by FOXO3 whereas Bim was only slightly elevated (Fig
4A-B). BH3-only proteins such as Bim, Noxa or tBID
bind to anti-apoptotic BCL2 proteins such as BCL2 and
BclxL and neutralize their pro-survival function [33].
Cleavage of BID after caspase-8 activation together with
increased Noxa and Bim therefore might displace BAX
and BAK from BCL2 and BclxL, leading to mitochondrial
outer membrane pore-formation and mitochondrial
damage. Noxa which is a weak BH3-only protein most
likely sensitizes T-ALL cells to TRAIL signaling by
inactivation of anti-apoptotic proteins. The induction of
Noxa by FOXO3 is also observed in neuroblastoma cells
[18] where it significantly contributes to mitochondrial
cell death by releasing BAX and BAK from BclxL [34,
35]. Noxa knockdown efficiently prevented cell death in
CEM cells (Fig 4D). This implies that Noxa acts in concert
with truncated BID to destabilize the BCL2-rheostat and,
together with TRAIL, mediates FOXO3-induced apoptosis
in ALL cells.
Primary T-ALL cells frequently show loss of the
INK4A gene locus and this genetic deletion also correlates
with relapse [8, 36-38]. We have demonstrated before
that reconstitution of this locus in CEM T-ALL cells
leads to G1 arrest (Fig 5A) and sensitizes the leukemia
cells to different apoptotic stimuli [27, 28]. Tetracyclinregulated expression of p16INK4A represses FOXO3 levels

DISCUSSION
In the present study we demonstrate that activation
of the transcription factor FOXO3 induces apoptotic
cell death in therapy-resistant T-ALL cells. Leukemia
cells frequently carry deletions of the phosphatase
PTEN resulting in PKB hyperactivation [6] and as a
consequence thereof FOXO3 inactivation and export
from the nucleus. We found cytoplasmic localization of
FOXO3 predominantly in the bone-marrow cells from
patients who poorly respond to prednisone treatment (Fig
1). CEM T-ALL cells, which were used in this study, are a
well-defined model for this leukemia subtype as they carry
a homozygous deletion of the tumor suppressor PTEN
[6] and were isolated from a patient after prednisonetherapy [29]. In these cells, the activation of a 4OHTregulated, PKB-phosphorylation-independent FOXO3www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

within 24 hours (Fig 5B), suggesting that as soon as the
INK4A locus is deleted during leukemogenesis FOXO3
levels may rise and FOXO3 has to be functionally
neutralized by hyperactive PKB. In this respect the
development of T-ALL subclones with hyperactivated
PI3K-PKB signaling due to e.g. deletion of the tumor
suppressor PTEN might be forced by the loss of p16INK4A.
In support of this hypothesis Ly294002 induces nuclear
accumulation of FOXO3 and cell death (supplemental
Fig. 3A-B) and p16INK4A-expressing T-ALL cells are less
sensitive to inhibition of the PI3K by Ly294002 (Fig 5C).
Stable expression of a FOXO3 wild-type protein (CEM/
p16-ECFP-FOXO3wt cells) to compensate for the loss of
endogenous FOXO3 abrogates the Ly294002-protective
effect of p16INK4A and restores apoptosis sensitivity to
the level of non-p16INK4A-expressing cells (Fig 5C).
This proves that the repression of FOXO3 by p16INK4A
reduces Ly294002 sensitivity. Interestingly if a PKBphosphorylation-independent FOXO3(A3)ER allele is
activated by 4OHT in p16INK4A-expressing cells, p16INK4A
further increases cell death (Fig 5D). These results are
consistent with our earlier report on p16INK4A-induced
changes of the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL2
proteins [28]. As p16INK4A causes repression of the Noxabinding partner MCL1 and in parallel increases Puma
and decreases BCL2-expression, p16INK4A-expressing
cells will be much more sensitive to induction of Noxa
and activation of BID via TRAIL by FOXO3. Therefore
the repression of endogenous FOXO3 by p16INK4A is even
essential for p16INK4A-expressing cells as the disturbed
balance of pro-and anti-apoptotic BCL2 proteins at
mitochondria renders these cells highly sensitive to
the detrimental effects of the FOXO3-targets Noxa and
TRAIL.
Our results demonstrate for the first time a link
between loss of p16INK4A and FOXO3-inactivation /
hyperactive PKB-signaling in T-ALL and both cancerassociated alterations correlate with therapy resistance in
leukemia cells. Both proteins affect the balance between
pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL2-proteins and thereby
determine drug sensitivity at the level of mitochondria.
Thereby, FOXO3 provides an interesting and promising
target in the PI3K-PKB pathway for cancer therapy, as its
posttranslational inactivation causes apoptosis resistance.

streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine (PAA, Pasching
Austria) at 5% CO2 and 37 °C in saturated humidity.
Generation and analysis of the p16INK4A-expressing clone
6E2/p16 have been described before [27]. PhoenixTM
packaging cells for production of amphotropic retroviruses
(kindly provided by G. Nolan, Standford) were cultured in
RPMI (BioWhittaker, Belgium), containing 10% fetal calf
serum. Ly294002 was obtained from Cayman Chemical
Europe (Talinn, Estonia). All cultures were routinely
tested for mycoplasma contamination (VenorRGeMmycoplasma detection kit, Minerva). All reagents were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Vienna, Austria) unless
indicated otherwise. For each experiment, mid-log phase
cultures were seeded in fresh medium.

Immunofluorescence
Primary T-ALL cell culture were placed on the slide
by cytospin and then fixed with formaldehyde (4%) for 15
min. Slides were treated with NH4Cl (Sigma-Aldrich) 50
mM for 15 min to reduce background.
Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100/
phosphate buffered saline for 3 min and incubated first
with blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin in
phosphate-buffered saline) and then with monoclonal
FOXO3 antibody (1:100, Cell Signaling Technology
Inc., Boston, USA) diluted in blocking buffer overnight
at 4 °C. Cells were then incubated for 1 h with specific
secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488
(1:1000; Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA, USA), and for 10 min
with 4.6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) 1:10000;
Sigma-Aldrich, Vienna, Austria). Images were acquired by
the videoconfocal system ViCo microscope Nikon Eclipse
80i (Nikon, Japan).

Primary cell cultures
T-ALL patient samples were obtained after
informed consent following the tenets of the Declaration
of Helsinki. Diagnosis was made according to standard
cytomorphology, cytochemistry and immunophenotypic
criteria. All analyzed T-ALL samples were obtained at the
time of diagnosis before treatment, after Ficoll–Hypaque
(Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) separation of mononuclear
cells. Mononuclear cells were frozen as viable cells in
FCS and 10% DMSO and stored in liquid nitrogen. The
percentage of CD7 cells ranged from 85 to 96%.

Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA, USA).
Following vectors have been described previously:
pLIB-FOXO3(A3)ERtm-iresNeo, pLIB-BCL2-iresPuro,
pLIB-BclxL-iresPuro, pLIB-CrmA-iresPuro, pLIBdnBID-iresPuro, pLIB-dnFADD-iresPuro, pQ-tetH1shBim-SV40-Puro,
pQ-tetH1-shNoxa-SV40Puro,
pLIB-ECFP-FOXO3wt-iresPuro, pLIB-MCS2-iresPuro,
pLIB-MCS2-iresNeo and pQ-tetH1-SV40Puro [18,
28, 34, 35]. For specific gene knockdown of TRAIL
annealed oligonucleotides coding for the TRAIL-specific
shRNA sequence GCAGATGCAGGACAAGTACT were
inserted into the BamH1-Mun1 sites of the plasmid pQtetH1-SV40-Puro. Plasmids were transfected into Phoenix
packaging cells to generate supernatants. After 48h, the
retrovirus-containing supernatants were filtered (0.22µm
syringe filters, Sartorius, Germany) and used to infect
CEM cells. The resulting cell lines are: CEM/FOXO3Ctr, CEM/FOXO3-BCL2, CEM/FOXO3-BclxL, CEM/
FOXO3-CrmA, CEM/FOXO3-dnFADD, CEM/FOXO3dnBID, CEM/FOXO3-shCtr, CEM/FOXO3-shBim, CEM/
FOXO3-shNoxa, CEM/FOXO3-shTRAIL, CEM/p16ECFP-FOXO3wt and CEM/p16-FOXO3(A3)ER.

BCL2, Bim, CrmA, caspase-8, FADD (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, Heidelberg, D), Noxa (Alexis Corporation,
Lausen, CH), TRAIL (Acris, Herford, Germany),
caspase-9 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and
α-Tubulin (Oncogene Research Products, USA) then
washed and incubated with anti-mouse, anti-rabbit or
anti-rat horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies (GE Healthcare, USA). The immunoblots
were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE
Healthcare, USA) according to the manufacturer´s
instructions and analyzed in an AutoChemi detection
system (UVP, England).

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR.
To quantify Bim, Noxa, and TRAIL mRNA levels
we designed real-time RT-PCR assays, using GAPDH
as reference gene. Total RNA was isolated from 5x106
cells using TRIzolTM Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, Vienna,
Austria) according to the manufacturer´s instructions.
Complementary DNA was synthesized from 1 µg
of total RNA using the RevertAidTM First Strand
H minus cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific,
Sankt Leon-Rot, Germany). The oligonucleotides
to amplify mRNA fragments were Bim (forward
5’-AGCACCCATGAGTTGTGACAAATC,
reverse
3’-CGTTAAACTCGTCTCCAATACGC),
Noxa
(forward
5’-AGCAGAGCTGGAAGTCGAGTGTG,
reverse 3’-TGATGCAGTCAGGTTCCTGAGC), TRAIL
(forward 5’-AAAGAGGTCCTCAGAGAGTAGCAGC,
reverse 3’-GCTCAGGAATGAATGCCCACTC), and
GAPDH (forward 5’-TGTTCGTCATGGGTGTGAACC,
reverse 3’-GCAGTGATGGCATGGACTGTG) and were
synthesized by Microsynth AG (Balgach, Switzerland).
After normalization on GAPDH expression, regulation
was calculated between treated and untreated cells.
Control is set as 100% expression.

Detection of apoptosis.
Apoptosis was assessed by staining the cells
with propidium-iodide (PI) or AnnexinV using a
CytomicsFC-500 Beckman Coulter as previously
described [39]: 2x105 cells were centrifuged and
resuspended in PI solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100.
Stained nuclei in the sub-G1 region were considered to
represent apoptotic cells. Mitochondrial activity and
membrane potential were assessed by the fluorescence
dye MitoTracker Red/CMX-Ros (Invitrogen, USA).
For measurement of AnnexinV positive cells 5x105 cells
were harvested and stained with FITC-labeled AnnexinV
(Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA, USA) in Annexin
Binding Buffer.

Statistics

Immunoblot.

Statistical significance of differences between
controls and treated cells were calculated using unpaired
t-test. All statistical analyses were performed using Graph
Pad Prism 4.0 software.

5x106 cells were lysed on ice in lysis-buffer (50
mM HEPES/NaOH, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 2
mM EDTA, 10% glycerol) with protease and phosphatase
inhibitors. Protein concentration was measured using
Bradford-Reagent (BioRad Laboratories, Munich,
Germany). Equal amounts of total protein (50 μg/
lane) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred
to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell,
Germany) by a semi-dry blotting device (Hoefer TE70,
Amersham Biosciences). Membrane blocking was
performed with PBS blocking buffer containing 0.1%
Tween20 and 5% nonfat dry milk, incubated with primary
antibodies specific for human BclxL, caspase-3, BID,
FOXO3, (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Boston, USA),
