Targeting interleukin-17 receptors
Wen-Hwa Lee, Heng-Hsiung Wu and Chun-Kai Huang

During the last decade, increasing evidence suggests
a strong association between chronic inflammation and
cancer development among different types of cancer.
The dysregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines or their
receptors is a common feature observed in many cancers
[1]. Cancer cells take advantage of cytokine or cytokine
receptor overexpression to benefit their own growth or
invasive capacity via the autocrine or paracrine loop.
The improved understanding about the crosstalk between
cancer cell and tumor microenvironment may raise the
foundations for development of novel drugs in cancer
treatment.
Pancreatic cancer is a malignant diseases associated
with significant intra- and peri-tumoral inflammation.
Recently, we showed that the pro-inflammatory autocrine/
paracrine IL-17B/IL-17RB signaling is essential for
pancreatic cancer malignancy [2]. Overexpression of IL17RB strongly correlates with post-operative metastasis
and inversely correlates with progression-free survival in
pancreatic cancer patients. The activated IL-17B/IL-17RB
signaling pathway increases the tumorigenic and metastatic
abilities of pancreatic cancer cells. The expressions of
CCL20, CXCL1, IL-8, and TFF1, induced by autocrine/
paracrine IL-17B/IL-17RB signaling through ERK1/2
pathway in pancreatic cancer cells, enhance inflammation
in the tumor microenvironment via recruiting neutrophils,
MQ and lymphocytes, which further support cancer cells
survival and facilitate metastasis. Likewise, chemokines
induced by IL-17B/IL-17RB may also be secreted from
stromal cells and participate in MQ and endothelial cell
recruitment to promote pancreatic cancer progression.
Except for TFF1 that is predominantly expressed in cancer
cells, CCL20, CXCL1 and IL-8 can be detected both in
pancreatic cancer cells and tumor surrounding stroma,
particularly in inflammatory cells, suggesting a vicious
cycle between cancer cells and infiltrating immune cells
in promoting tumor malignancy as illustrated in Figure
1. It appears that IL-17B/IL-17RB signaling enhances
cancer cell malignancy and simultaneously remodels its
microenvironment (i.e. MQ and vasculogenic endothelial
cells recruitment) to facilitate metastasis by, in part,
secreting these chemokines. Taken together, the IL-17B/
IL-17RB signaling not only emerges as an important
regulator of pancreatic cancer growth and metastasis,
but also serves as an obvious target for pancreatic cancer
treatment [2].

To translate this finding into a potential clinical
application, a monoclonal antibody recognizing the native
form of IL-17RB was generated. Treatment with this
newly made monoclonal antibody not only effectively
blocks pancreatic tumor metastasis, but also significantly
prolongs survivals in a mouse xenograft model. These
results suggest that IL-17B/IL17RB signaling is a major
contributor to the highly aggressive characteristics of
pancreatic cancer, and provide a practical approach to
tackle this disease [2]. Similarly, blocking IL-17RB signal
reduces breast tumor growth [3]. Thus, targeting IL-17B/
IL-17RB is likely a useful approach for treating cancers
with this activated pathway.
The presence of other IL-17 members in tumor
microenvironment has been reported as a part of the
inflammatory conditions that promotes tumorigenesis and
metastasis. The IL-17 family consists of six cytokines, IL17A through IL-17F, with 20-50% sequence homology.
IL-17A and IL-17F are pro-inflammatory cytokines

exclusively secreted by activated T-cells. IL-17B, IL17C, IL-17D and IL-17E are expressed in various tissues
at low amounts. The cognate receptors for the IL-17
family, IL-17RA to IL-17RE, have been identified, but the
physiological roles of these receptors have yet to be fully
characterized [4]. Interestingly IL-17A has been shown
to promote tumor growth through an IL-6-Stat3 signaling
pathway, suggesting that IL-17A paracrine network can
also serve as a target for cancer treatment [5].
McAllister and co-workers demonstrated a potential
value of IL-17A/IL-17RA blockade in pancreatic
intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) progression in a murine
model. They found that activation of Kras in PanIN
cells not only recruited CD4+T and γδT cells to PanIN
surrounding stroma to enhance the chronic pancreatitis,
but also induced the overexpression of IL-17RA in the
PanIN cells. Interestingly, neutralization of IL-17A/
IL-17RA pathway via specific antibodies delays the
progression of PanINs [6]. Consistently, in skin tumor, the
recruitment of IL-17A-producing CD4+T cells was shown
to mediate enhancement of papilloma formation, and
abrogation of IL-17A signaling with antibody significantly
attenuates skin tumor formation [7]. Although it remains
to be seen in human tumors, these two studies from murine
models suggest that targeting IL-17A/IL-17RA axis can
also be a valuable approach for cancer treatment.
In sum, these studies clearly indicate the critical
roles of IL-17 signaling in cancer progression and a useful
approach for treating cancer by intercepting this signal.
However, elucidating the intricacy between cancer cells
and its inflammatory microenvironment warrants more
efforts from immunologists and cancer biologists.
