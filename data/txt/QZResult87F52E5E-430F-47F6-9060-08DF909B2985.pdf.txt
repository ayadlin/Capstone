Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Shp2 (Ptpn11) Plays an
Important Role in Maintenance of Chromosome Stability
Xia Liu, Hong Zheng, and Cheng-Kui Qu

Abstract
Both activating and inactivating mutations in protein tyrosine phosphatase Ptpn11 (encoding Shp2) are
associated with tumorigenesis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that
Shp2 plays an important role in mitosis, dysregulation of which results in chromosome instability and cancer
predisposition. Depletion of Shp2 compromised the mitotic checkpoint. Shp2-depleted cells exhibited a delay
in mitotic entry and an earlier mitotic exit. Moreover, Shp2 deﬁciency caused defective kinetochoremicrotubule attachment, chromosome misalignment, chromosomal congression defects, lagging chromosomes, and chromosome missegregation. Reintroduction of wild-type Shp2, but not a catalytically deﬁcient
mutant, restored the checkpoint function and chromosome alignment at metaphase in Shp2-deﬁcient cells,
establishing a requirement for the catalytic activity of Shp2 during mitosis. Further analyses revealed that
Shp2 was required for the optimal activation of the mitotic kinases PLK1 and Aurora B and thereby the
proper kinetochore localization and phosphorylation of BubR1, a core mitotic checkpoint protein that is also
critical for chromosome alignment. Together, our ﬁndings show a previously unrecognized role for Shp2 in
the maintenance of chromosome stability and suggest a new mechanism by which dysregulation of Shp2
signaling contributes to malignancy development. Cancer Res; 72(20); 5296–306. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Mitosis is the biologic process by which a eukaryotic cell
precisely separates replicated sister chromatids into 2 daughter cells during cell division. Deregulated mitotic activities are
associated with chromosomal instability and aneuploidy, a key
feature of many cancers (1–3). Mitosis is an extraordinarily
complex process. Many proteins are involved in the regulation
of mitosis. Among these proteins, polo-like kinases (PLK),
especially, PLK1 is involved in a variety of mitotic events
including the G2–M transition, centrosome maturation and
separation, mitotic spindle formation, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis (4–6). It exerts its multiple functions by
phosphorylating a wide spectrum of substrates. In addition,
members of the Aurora kinase family, such as Aurora B, have
emerged as key mitotic regulators. They are involved in centrosome separation and maturation, spindle assembly and
stability, chromosomal condensation, congression and segre-

gation, and cytokinesis (5, 7, 8). Aurora kinases function also by
phosphorylating many substrate proteins.
Multiple ﬁdelity-monitoring checkpoint systems have
evolved to ensure correct temporal and spatial coordination
of mitosis. The mitotic checkpoint, also known as the spindle
assembly checkpoint, is a cellular surveillance mechanism that
acts to inhibit entry into anaphase until all chromosomes have
successfully attached to spindle microtubules (1, 2, 9). This
checkpoint is mediated by a set of highly conserved proteins
including Mad1, Mad2, Mad3/BubR1, Bub1, and Bub3 (2).
Proper recruitment of these checkpoint proteins to unaligned
kinetochores, the protein structures on chromosomes where
the spindle microtubules attach, is essential for the mitotic
checkpoint to delay anaphase onset. Displacement of these
proteins from kinetochores is associated with mitotic checkpoint defects and chromosomal instability. Among them,
BubR1 is a central checkpoint protein in term of its essential
role for kinetochore localization of other mitotic checkpoint
proteins (10). Aurora B kinase is also involved in the regulation
of the mitotic checkpoint (11). Inhibition of Aurora B disturbs
kinetochore localization of BubR1, Mad2, and Cenp-E, thereby
compromising mitotic checkpoint function (12). In addition, a
recent study has shown that Aurora B plays a direct role in
initiating the mitotic checkpoint by potentiating Mps1 activation (13).
In addition to the mitotic checkpoint, temporal and spatial
regulation of kinetochore-microtubule (KT-MT) attachment is
essential for error-free chromosome segregation. All chromosomes/kinetochores must be attached to the spindle microtubules and properly aligned to the metaphase plate for

accurate chromosome segregation. Depletion of BubR1 not
only disturbs the mitotic checkpoint but also leads to severe
chromosome misalignment (12), suggesting that BubR1 plays a
dual role in both checkpoint signaling and chromosome alignment. Several lines of evidence show that BubR1 is required for
stable chromosome-spindle attachments (14, 15). BubR1 is
highly phosphorylated in mitosis, and that phosphorylation
of BubR1 is important for maintaining proper KT-MT attachments and chromosome alignment (14, 15). Recent studies
have shown that BubR1 is a substrate of PLK1 and that PLK1
regulates chromosome alignment through phosphorylation
of BubR1 (14, 16).
Shp2, a ubiquitously expressed Src homology 2 domaincontaining protein tyrosine phosphatase, has been implicated in diverse cytoplasmic signaling processes activated by
growth factors, hormones, cytokines, and extracellular
matrix proteins (17, 18). Mutations in Ptpn11 (encoding Shp2)
are involved in several human diseases, including cancers
(19–21). Although activating mutations in Ptpn11 are associated with Noonan syndrome, childhood leukemias, and
sporadic solid tumors, Leopard syndrome patients with
Ptpn11 inactivating mutations also have increased risks of
developing malignancies (22–25). In addition, a recent study
has shown that Ptpn11 deﬁciency enhances diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocellular carcinoma development (26).
However, the molecular mechanisms by which deregulated
Shp2 signaling is linked to malignancies are not well understood because of lack of complete understanding of Shp2
function. The cytoplasmic function of Shp2 cannot fully
explain how both activating and inactivating mutations in
Shp2 induce tumorigenesis. Emerging evidence has indicated
that Shp2 may also function in other cell organelles, such as
the nucleus (27–31) and the mitochondria (32, 33). Understanding of the novel functions of Shp2 in these organelles
may shed light on the molecular mechanisms of Shp2-associated tumorigenesis. In our recent studies investigating
effects of activating mutations of Ptpn11 on malignant transformation of hematopoietic cells, we have discovered that
gain of function of this phosphatase causes aneuploidy (34),
which is known to be associated with aberrant mitosis. This
unexpected ﬁnding led us to further explore the novel function of Shp2 in mitosis.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, synchronization, and transfection
HeLa cell line used in this study were originally purchased
from American Type Culture Collection and maintained
10 to 15 passages in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium
supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100
mg/mL streptomycin. Mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF)
generated from Ptpn11 conditional knockout (Ptpn11ﬂ/ﬂ)
mice were provided by Dr. B. G. Neel. They were previously
characterized (35) and were maintained as described
above. To synchronize cells at the G1-phase, cells were
treated with thymidine (2 mmol/L) for 17 hours, washed
with PBS 3 times, and then incubated for 9 hours in fresh
medium without thymidine. Thymidine (2 mmol/L) was

added again for another 16 hours. To arrest the cells in
mitosis, cells were treated with nocodazole (200 ng/mL and
400 ng/mL for HeLa cells and MEFs, respectively) for 16
hours. Mitotic cells were then isolated by "shake-off." For
release experiments, isolated mitotic cells were washed 3
times with PBS and plated into fresh medium for the
indicated periods of time. To knockdown Shp2, HeLa cells
were transfected with Shp2 siRNA corresponding to 50 -AAG
AAU CCU AUG GUG GAA ACA-30 using an Amaxa Nucleofector and a transfection kit according to the manufacturer's
protocol (Lonza Group Ltd.).
Time-lapse video microscopy
Cells were plated in 35 mm culture dishes. Twenty-four
hours later, cells were monitored using a Leica DMI600B
inverted microscope equipped with an environmental control
chamber. Images were taken every 3 or 5 minutes with a Retiga
EXI 12 bit camera (Q imaging) and analyzed with MetaMorph
software (Universal Imaging Corp.).
Immunostaining and confocal microscopy
For analysis of cold-stable microtubules, cells were ﬁxed for
10 minutes at room temperature with 3.7% formaldehyde in
100 mmol/L Pipes at pH 6.8, 10 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L
MgCl2, and 0.2% Triton X-100. For all other experiments, cells
were ﬁxed in 100% methanol at 20 C for 10 minutes. After
ﬁxation, cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in
PBS, and then blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS
for 1 hour. All primary antibodies were incubated at room
temperature for 1 hour or at 4 C overnight. Cells were then
washed 3 times with PBS and incubated with Alexa 488- or
Alexa 568-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hour. Nuclei
were counterstained with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI). After washing, coverslips were mounted onto glass
slides and stained cells were examined with a Nikon ﬂuorescence microscope (Nikon). All confocal images were acquired
using a Zeiss LSM 510 inverted laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss) and analyzed with Zeiss and MetaMorph software. For staining of chromosome spreads, mitotic cells were
obtained by shake-off and swelled in a prewarmed 75 mmol/L
KCl hypotonic solution at 37 C for 15 minutes. After spun onto
slides using cytospin, chromosomes were ﬁxed and stained
with indicated antibodies as above.
For the chromosome alignment assay, control or Shp2
siRNA transfected HeLa cells were synchronized by double
thymidine block and released for 10 hours, and then arrested at
metaphase by the treatment with MG132 (10 mmol/L) for 2
hours. Cells were ﬁxed and processed for immunostaining. To
count unaligned kinetochores, all images were acquired as Zstack with 0.2 mm spacing using a 100 objective. Misaligned
kinetochores were deﬁned as those without localizing to
equatorial plate. At least 5 cells (400 kinetochores) were
analyzed for each experiment.

Results
Depletion of Shp2 results in a delay in entering mitosis
and causes a failure to sustain the mitotic arrest induced
by nocodazole
To test the potential role of Shp2 in mitosis, we transfected
HeLa cells with Shp2-speciﬁc siRNA and assessed cellular
responses to nocodazole, a microtubule-depolymerizing agent
that activates the mitotic checkpoint and arrests cells at
mitosis. Note that 75% of control cells were arrested at the
mitotic stage deﬁned by 4n DNA content and phospho-histone
H3 (Ser10)-positive staining. In contrast, knockdown of Shp2
substantially decreased nocodazole-induced mitotic arrest in a
Shp2 dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A and B). Similarly, the

percentage of mitotic cells in Shp2-depleted cells treated with
taxol, another microtubule poison, was also decreased significantly (Supplementary Fig. S1). To minimize potential inﬂuence of the cell-cycle status on cellular responses to mitotic
arrest, asynchronized and synchronized G1 HeLa cells were
treated with nocodazole and mitotic cells were assessed at
multiple time points. Both asynchronized and synchronized
Shp2 knockdown cells showed decreased mitotic arrest (Fig.
1C and Supplementary Fig. S2). Consistent with the reduction
of mitotic cells, phosphorylation of histone H3 in Shp2-depleted cells was much lower than that in control cells and the
inhibitory phosphorylation (Tyr15) of Cdc2 kinase (the kinase
activity that is required for mitotic entry) was sustained at

markedly decreased response to this microtubule poison
(Fig. 2A and B). By carefully monitoring individual cells,
we noticed that about 40% of Shp2 knockdown cells failed to
enter metaphase, being arrested at the G2-phase. Furthermore,
the percentage of Shp2-depleted cells that escaped from
mitotic arrest was increased. In addition, Shp2-depleted
mitotic cells underwent a higher incidence of death (Fig.
2C). We next focused on mitotic cells arrested by nocodazole
and quantiﬁed the duration of mitotic arrest. In the presence of
nocodazole, more than 50% of control cells that were arrested

However, the percentage of phospho-histone H3-negative
Shp2-depleted cells with 4n DNA content were increased

tetraploid G1 cells escaped from mitosis without dividing. To
clarify these possibilities, live synchronized cells at the G1
-phase were cultured in the presence of nocodazole and
monitored by time-lapse video microscopy. Consistent with

Figure 2. Shp2 depletion delays entry into mitosis and shortens mitotic arrest in the presence of nocodazole. A, HeLa cells transfected with control or

time-lapse video microscopy for 24 hours. B, cumulative mitotic cell counts were carried out by tracking cells in 6 random ﬁelds over 24 hours. The ﬁelds
were combined and cells entering mitosis (became rounded) were cumulated and reported as a percentage of the total cells in the ﬁelds at the start of
the experiments. C, those cells that changed from the ﬂat morphology to the rounded and stayed rounded at the end of the experiment were
classiﬁed as mitotic, whereas those that changed from the ﬂat morphology to the rounded but subsequently ﬂattened back were counted as escaped,
and those that did not ﬂatten back but subsequently shrunk and broke into pieces were identiﬁed as dead. Those cells that had stayed ﬂat
without turning rounded at the end of the experiment were G2 cells (these cells contained 4n DNA content as veriﬁed by ﬂuorescence-activated
cell sorting). D, asynchronous control or Shp2 siRNA–transfected HeLa cells were cultured in the presence of nocodazole and monitored by

catalytic activity of Shp2 is required for its function in this

in mitosis stayed in mitosis for up to 16 hours, whereas
approximately 80% of Shp2-depleted cells escaped from mitotic arrest without dividing and returned to G1 with tetraploid
DNA content within 12 hours (Fig. 2D and E). These data
suggest that Shp2 ablation results in a delay in entering mitosis
as well as a premature mitotic exit despite the spindle defects
caused by nocodazole.
A proper control of anaphase onset/mitotic exit depends on
ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of key regulators at the correct
time. We collected nocodazole-arrested mitotic cells and
examined levels of cyclin B1, PLK1, Mad2, and phosphohistone H3 after release in regular fresh culture medium.
Consistent with the earlier mitotic exit found in the presence
of nocodazole, degradation of PLK1 and cyclin B1 was accelerated in Shp2 knockdown cells in the absence of nocodazole
(Fig. 2F and Supplementary Fig. S3). Phosphorylation of histone H3 was also decreased much faster in Shp2-depleted
cells (Fig. 2F). In contrast, Mad2 was not signiﬁcantly degraded
in either control or Shp2-depleted cells (Fig. 2F).

Depletion of Shp2 causes chromosome misalignment
and defective KT-MT attachment
To further determine the role of Shp2 in mitosis, unperturbed mitotic progression was directly visualized in a greater
detail. HeLa cells stably expressing a histone H2B-GFP fusion
protein that enables monitoring chromosomes in live cells
with high resolution were transfected with control or Shp2
siRNA, and then monitored under a video microscope. The
percentages of mitotic cells with misaligned and lagging
chromosomes were markedly increased after Shp2 depletion
(Fig. 4A–C). Moreover, some Shp2-depleted cells entered
anaphase without chromosome aligning to the metaphase
plate, indicative of chromosome congression defects (Fig. 4B
and C), and in some cases, metaphase chromosomes underwent decondensation before the onset of anaphase (Fig. 4B).
As a result, the unperturbed mitosis of Shp2-depleted cells
was signiﬁcantly prolonged because of these mitotic defects
(Fig. 4D), similar to that of PLK1 deﬁcient cells (39). In
agreement with these chromosome analyses results, Shp2
knockdown primary MEFs developed increased aneuploidy
compared with control cells (Fig. 4E).
To rule out the possibility that chromosome misalignment
in Shp2-depleted cells was because of premature mitotic exit,
we blocked the anaphase onset using the proteasome inhibitor
MG132. Under these conditions, Shp2-depleted metaphase
cells with chromosome misalignment (Fig. 5A) and telophase
cells with lagging chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S4) were
still signiﬁcantly increased. Further rescue experiments
showed that add-back of WT Shp2, but not catalytically
deﬁcient Shp2 C459S, restored chromosomal alignment at
metaphase (Fig. 5B), reafﬁrming the catalytic-dependent role

Catalytic activity is required for Shp2 function in mitosis
Shp2 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that functions in cell
signaling in both catalytically dependent and independent
manners (36–38). To further elucidate the structural bases for
the important role of Shp2 in mitosis, WT Shp2 and mutant
Shp2 with C459S mutation that abolishes its catalytic activity
were transduced into conditional knockout (Ptpn11ﬂ/ﬂ) MEFs.
Transduced cells were infected with adenovirus expressing Cre
DNA recombinase (to deplete endogenous Shp2) followed by
nocodazole treatment. Consistent with the data shown in Fig.
1, acute depletion of Shp2 decreased mitotic arrest signiﬁcantly (Fig. 3A). Reintroduction of WT Shp2, but not Shp2 C459S,
largely restored responses of Shp2-depleted cells to nocodazole-induced mitotic arrest (Fig. 3B and C). These rescue

chores. However, kinetochore signals of BubR1 were diminished in Shp2-depleted cells (Fig. 6A). To conﬁrm this result, we
conducted centromeric staining of chromosome spreads. As
illustrated in Fig. 6B, the percentage of the metaphase spreads
with strong BubR1 signals at kinetochores also was decreased
signiﬁcantly in Shp2-depleted cells. In contrast, the kinetochore localization of Mad2 was unaffected (data not shown).
Previous studies have shown that Aurora B activity is important for kinetochore localization of BubR1 (12, 14, 41). We
tested whether mislocalization of BubR1 might be associated
with abnormal Aurora B activation and found that Aurora B
kinase activity determined by phosphorylation of Thr232 (Fig.
6C) and kinase assays (Fig. 6D) was signiﬁcantly decreased in
Shp2-depleted cells. These results suggest that decreased

Kinetochore localization of BubR1 and Aurora B kinase

Proper localization to kinetochores is critical for mitotic
proteins to execute their functions (40), and displacement of
these proteins from kinetochores is associated with mitotic
checkpoint defects. To elucidate the mechanisms of the defective mitotic checkpoint caused by Shp2 depletion, we examined the kinetochore localization of BubR1 and Mad2. In
control mitotic cells, BubR1 was nicely localized to kineto-

The kinetochore localization of BubR1 has been shown to be

We determined phosphorylation levels of BubR1 in mitotic
cells. In response to nocodazole and taxol, phosphorylation of
BubR1 was substantially decreased in Shp2-depleted cells
compared with those in control cells (Fig. 7A). To exclude the
possibility that the decreased phosphorylation of BubR1 was

phosphorylation levels of BubR1 were also determined in

studies have shown that BubR1 is a substrate of PLK1 (14, 16).
We assessed PLK1 kinase activity in Shp2-depleted mitotic
cells. As seen in Fig. 7C and D, PLK1 activity determined by
phosphorylation of Thr210 and kinase assays was decreased
signiﬁcantly in Shp2 knockdown cells. These results suggest
that decreased PLK1 activity, followed by the consequent
reduction of BubR1 phosphorylation, leads to chromosome
misalignment in Shp2-depleted cells.

Shp2 in Maintenance of Chromosome Stability

signaling pathways by interacting with numerous signaling
proteins. However, the information gathered from previous
studies represents the role of Shp2 in interphase, likely G0–G1
cells, because the cells used in those studies were usually
growth factor starved. By focusing on mitotic cells we now
show that Shp2 also plays an important role in maintenance of
chromosome stability. Both activating mutations and inactivating mutations in Ptpn11 (Shp2) are associated with tumorigenesis. Leopard syndrome patients with Ptpn11 inactivating
mutations also have increased risks of developing malignancies (23–25). As inactivated Leopard syndrome mutant Shp2
functions in a dominant negative manner because of the
increased binding of mutant Shp2 to signaling partners (22),
it is possible that the mutant Shp2 contributes to malignancy
development by decreasing Shp2 catalytic activity and thereby
causing chromosomal instability although it may reduce cell
growth.
Shp2 seems to facilitate the mitotic checkpoint and chromosome alignment by promoting PLK1 and Aurora B activation. PLK1 and Aurora B are multifunctional kinases that are
critical for all stages of mitosis. Overexpression of these kinases
has been observed in tumors, suggesting that these kinases
may act as oncogenes (42–45). However, missense mutations in
PLK1 have also been identiﬁed in several cancer cell lines (46).
Moreover, inhibition of PLK1 leads to delayed mitotic entry
and cells are arrested in mitosis with a monopolar or disorganized spindle (39, 47). Inhibition of Aurora B in cells causes
misaligned chromosomes, perturbed cytokinesis, and resistance to taxol-induced mitotic arrest (12). As both PLK1 and
Aurora B kinase activities were decreased in Shp2-depleted
cells (Figs. 6C, D, 7C, and D), the phenotypes displayed by these
cells may reﬂect combined effects of PLK1 and Aurora B
deﬁciencies. Delayed entry into mitosis and prolonged duration of unperturbed mitosis are likely the consequences of
decreased PLK1 activity while failure to sustain microtubule
poisons-induced mitotic arrest, chromosomal misalignment,
chromosomal congression defects, and chromosomal missegregation might result from decreased Aurora B activity.
Aurora B has been shown to be required for the kinetochore
localization of BubR1 (12, 14, 48), a core mitotic checkpoint
protein. This accounts for the diminished kinetochore localization of BubR1 in Shp2-depleted cells (Fig. 6A and B). Because
recruitment of BubR1 to unattached kinetochores is necessary
to maintain the mitotic checkpoint, it is likely that loss of Shp2
compromises this checkpoint by interrupting kinetochore
localization of BubR1. PLK1 and Aurora B have been shown
to be required for the phosphorylation of BubR1 (12, 14, 16),
which is important for chromosome alignment. BubR1 phosphorylation is signiﬁcantly decreased in Shp2 knockdown cells
(Fig. 7A and B). Thus, it seems that Shp2 depletion causes

chromosome misalignment also by reducing PLK1 and Aurora
B activation. A proposed model of Shp2 function in the
maintenance of genomic stability is shown in Fig. 7E.
How Shp2 promotes activation of PLK1 and Aurora B
kinases remains to be further determined. Shp2 plays an overall
positive role in the activation of receptor and cytosolic kinases
despite its direct function in protein dephosphorylation (17,
18). The underlying mechanism is completely unclear. As such,
it is not understood why PLK1 activity is decreased in Shp2depleted mitotic cells. Aurora B kinase activity is also
decreased by depletion of Shp2 (Fig. 6C and D). This is likely
the result of decreased PLK1 activity because of the well
recognized extensive interplay between PLK1 and Aurora B
kinases (5). Further studies are needed to deﬁne the detailed
molecular mechanisms by which Shp2 promotes PLK1 activity.
Shp2 seems to function in this context in a catalytic-dependent
manner as only WT Shp2, but not catalytically-deﬁcient
Shp2 C459S, restores nocodazole-induced mitotic arrest and
chromosome alignment in Shp2-depleted cells (Figs. 3 and 5B).
It seems that a general mechanism might be involved in the
functional interactions between Shp2 and its interacting
kinases. Elucidation of rudimental biochemical activities of
this phosphatase may shed new light on its acting mechanisms
in these signaling pathways.
