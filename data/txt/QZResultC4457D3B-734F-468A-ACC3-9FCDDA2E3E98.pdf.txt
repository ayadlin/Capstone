Abstract
Circulating tumor cells (CTC) in blood are promising new
biomarkers potentially useful for prognostic prediction and monitoring of therapies in patients with solid tumors including
colon cancer. Moreover, CTC research opens a new avenue for
understanding the biology of metastasis in patients with cancer.
However, an in-depth investigation of CTCs is hampered by the
very low number of these cells, especially in the blood of patients
with colorectal cancer. Thus, the establishment of cell cultures and
permanent cell lines from CTCs has become the most challenging
task over the past year. Here, we describe, for the ﬁrst time, the
establishment of cell cultures and a permanent cell line from CTCs
of one patient with colon cancer. The cell line designated CTCMCC-41 has been cultured for more than one year, and the cells

have been characterized at the genome, transcriptome, proteome,
and secretome levels. This thorough analysis showed that CTCMCC-41 cells resemble characteristics of the original tumor cells
in the patient with colon cancer and display a stable phenotype
characterized by an intermediate epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype, stem cell–like properties, and an osteomimetic signature,
indicating a bone marrow origin. Functional studies showed that
CTC-MCC-41 cells induced rapidly in vitro endothelial cell tube
formation and in vivo tumors after xenografting in immunodeﬁcient mice. The establishment of this ﬁrst colon cancer CTC line
allows now a wealth of functional studies on the biology of CTCs
as well as in vitro and in vivo drug testing. Cancer Res; 75(5); 892–901.

Introduction

molecular characterization of single CTCs has revealed important
information on the genotype and phenotype of these tumor cells
and demonstrated a striking heterogeneity of CTCs (8). Thus, the
current challenge is now to identify the functional properties of
the different CTC subsets. Functional assays are mandatory to
discover the biology of CTCs with particular emphasis on the
discovery of the metastasis-initiator cells. At present, such assays
are limited by the very low concentration and yield of CTCs.
Besides the development of improved CTC capture methods
with higher yields, it will be important to expand the number of
CTCs in cell culture systems for functional analyses. Short-term
cultures of CTCs have become possible by the EPISPOT assay 10
years ago (9); this assay detects speciﬁc proteins secreted during
the in vitro culture of CTCs (10), and clinical studies in breast and
colon cancer indicate that the detection of viable CTCs is associated with an unfavorable outcome (11, 12). First ex vivo expansion of CTCs has been described in breast cancer by Zhang and
colleagues (13) and more recently by Yu and colleagues (14).
Another approach to expand the number of CTCs is xenotransplantation of patient-derived CTCs into immunodeﬁcient mice.
The ﬁrst report by Baccelli and colleagues (15) showed that grown
metastases after xenotransplantation of breast cancer CTCs into
the bone of immunodeﬁcient mice had an EpCAMlow, C-methigh,
CD47high CD44high phenotype, which may be characteristic of
metastasis-initiator cells. The second report was published on
patients with small-cell lung cancer, demonstrating that CTCs
from patients with either chemosensitive or chemorefractory
tumors are tumorigenic in immune-compromised mice, and the
resultant CTC-derived explants mirrored the donor patient's
response to platinum and etoposide chemotherapy (16). However, these in vivo assays require at present very high CTC

The use of circulating tumor cells (CTC) as real-time liquid
biopsy has received major attraction over the past years (1, 2).
Blood samples can be obtained at the time of diagnosis and
during the course of a systemic therapy. Several large scale clinical
trials and meta-analyses have shown that the number of CTCs is
an important indicator of the risk of progression or death in
patients with metastatic solid tumors (3–7). In addition, the

Characterization of a Colon CTC Line

concentrations in the transplanted blood sample (e.g., > 1,000
cells per 7.5 mL in breast cancer), which were so far only achieved
in a few index patients.
To our best knowledge, there is no report on the in vitro or in vivo
expansion of CTCs from patients with colon cancer. Here, we
report on the ﬁrst establishment of CTC cultures from colon
cancer–derived CTCs and their in-depth characterization including xenografts into immunodeﬁcient mice.

Materials and Methods
Patient samples and blood collection
After informed consent was given, peripheral blood from
patients with a nonresectable metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma was collected before the start of ﬁrst line of chemotherapy
combining FOLFIRI and bevacizumab under the COLOSPOT
study (NCT01596790-Patients inclusion period: 2011–2014).
Blood was collected in CellSave tubes (Janssen; 10 mL) for CTC
detection (Supplementary Materials and Methods) as well as in
EDTA tubes (10 mL) for ex vivo CTC culture (Supplementary
Materials and Methods).
Cell cultures
Culture conditions of primary endothelial cells, mammary
cancer cell lines MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and BCM1, and colorectal
cancer cell line HT-29 are detailed in the Supplementary Materials
and Methods.
Immunocytochemical analyses
Single CTCs and CTC spheres were taken under a microscope
with a STRIPPER micropipetter (ORIGIO) and put on a blue
alcyan coated slide. After ﬁxation and permeabilization with PFA
3.7% þ Triton 0.2% in PBS solution, cells and spheres were
labeled with a large panel of antibodies (Supplementary Table
S1) and analyzed under a light microscope.
Flow cytometry experiments
The same panel of proteins (Supplementary Table S1) was
tested by ﬂow cytometry to characterize the CTC cell line. A
ﬁxation/permeabilization kit (Beckman Coulter) was used for
the detection of the expression of intracellular proteins, whereas
extracellular proteins were directly revealed by adding antibodies
without ﬁxation. Labeled CTCs were analyzed and detected by
using the Cyan cytometer (Beckman Coulter), and the data were
analyzed with the Kaluza software (Beckman Coulter).
Histopathologic and immunohistochemical analyses of the
original tumor cells of the patient with colon cancer and the
xenografts
Parafﬁn-embedded tumor tissues: (i) primary tumor biopsy of
the patient with colon cancer, (ii) lymph node biopsy of the
patient with colon cancer, and (iii) subcutaneous CTC-MCC-41
xenografts in SCID mice were cut in 3-mm sections and analyzed
for CK20 expression (Supplementary Materials and Methods).
EPISPOT assays
The ﬂuoro-EPISPOT assay was performed as previously
described (17). For the new proteins analyzed, i.e., VEGF, EGFR,
and osteoprotegerin, corresponding protocols are detailed in
Supplementary Materials and Methods.

In vitro angiogenesis: endothelial cell tube formation
A 24-well plate coated with 1.3 mL Matrigel (BD Biosciences) per well was solidiﬁed at 37 C for 30 minutes.
Endothelial cells (105 cells/well) were seeded into the plate
and cultured for 6 hours. For tube formation experiments, cells
were cultured under different media conditions (in duplicates):
(1) RPMI 1640, a basal medium (negative control), (2) an
endothelial complete medium with additional endothelial
growth factors and heparin (positive control), and (3) RPMI
1640 basal medium used for a 48-hour CTC culture (cell
culture supernatant).
Single-cell RT-PCR analysis of CTCs
AmpliSpeed technology (Beckman Coulter) was used for
complementary DNA (cDNA) obtention by the reverse transcription at the single cell level (Supplementary Materials and
Methods).
Next-generation sequencing for copy-number variations
Two spheres and one single cell were transferred each to an
individual PCR tube (0.2 mL), after which whole genome ampliﬁcation was performed using the PicoPlex WGA Kit according to
manufacturer's protocol (Rubicon Genomics). Next, library preparation was performed using the TruSeq DNA preparation Kit
according to manufacturer's protocol. Next-generation sequencing was performed by a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina) using single reads
for 100 cycles. Analyses and identiﬁcation of copy-number alterations were performed using Control-FREEC and a custom script in
MatLab.
Subcutaneous tumorigenicity assay
To investigate the tumorigenicity of the CTC cell line, ﬁve SCID
mice (Charles River; background BALB/c, aged 12 weeks) were
injected subcutaneously with 106 CTC-MCC-41 cells per 200 mL
medium into their right shoulder. The mice were constantly
monitored on tumor growth, and the animals were sacriﬁced if
the total tumor burden reached 10% of the total body weight.
From the sacriﬁced mice, tumors were collected for their histological analysis.
Analyses of KRAS and BRAF mutations
We compared mutations in the KRAS gene (codons 12 and 13)
and BRAF gene in the primary tumor and the lymph node
metastasis of the patient with colon cancer as well as the CTCMCC-41 cell line and the xenografts (Supplementary Materials
and Methods).

Results
Ex vivo culture of isolated CTC from patients with metastatic
colon cancer
Peripheral blood samples from 71 patients were analyzed by
the CellSearch system. Fifty of 71 (70.4%) patients were positive
for CTCs with a CTC count of 1 using the CellSearch System
(mean, 19.9; median, 4; range, 1–516) and 38 of 71 (53.5%)
patients with a CTC count of 3 (mean, 36.6; median, 9; range, 3–
516), which is the prognostic cutoff for patients with metastatic
CRC (Table 1; ref. 4). Only 18 patients (25.4%) had a number of
CTCs exceeding 10 CTCs and 3 patients (4.2%) had more than
100 CTCs in their blood samples.

From the marked patients, we were able to expand CTCs in cell culture.

Yesa

Long-term CTC cultures could be established from two patients
who had a CTC count of 300. Concerning the ﬁrst patient
(no. 5), we could expand the CTCs in medium 1, cf. Materials
and Methods) for more than 2 months, but after that period they
gradually died off. Pathologists characterized the expanded cells as
tumor cells, but we did not further analyze them. In contrast, from
a second patient (no. 37), we were able to establish a permanent
cell line. Indeed, viable CTCs were still observed after 4 days of cell
culture in medium 1 under hypoxic conditions (cf. Materials and
Methods) then, after 10 days, CTCs started to proliferate and
formed spheres. Hypoxia is an important growth stimulus in
particular for stem cells, and recent understanding of cancer stem
cell biology and their similarities to somatic stem cells suggests
that hypoxia acts to regulate the cancer stem cell phenotype (18).
Another important culture condition issue was to switch them to
medium 2 (cf. Materials and Methods) where CTC-sphere formation continued (Fig. 1A). Moreover, immunocytochemistry experiments have been performed with anti-EpCAM, anti-CK20, and
anti-CD45 Abs, showing that these CTC spheres were of epithelial
origin (Fig. 1B). Comparing cell culture growth in both media, we
observed a signiﬁcantly increased proliferation with a doubling
time in 20 hours in the medium 2 as compared with a doubling
time of 37 hours in the medium 1. Because of this rapid expansion,
a change of the medium 2 was required every two days to obtain
good viability of tumor cells. This procedure led to the establishment of the ﬁrst permanent CTC colon cancer cell line that
we decided to name "CTC-MCC-41," which is now growing in
culture for >16 months with a maintained high doubling time
of 20 hours with medium 2. The CTC-MCC-41 cell line can be
frozen, banked, and thawed for successful regrowth.
Clinicopathologic characteristics of the patient and tumor
giving rise to CTC-MCC-41
Standard histopathologic analysis of diagnostic biopsies performed on the primary tumor and one lymph node revealed a
poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with a lot of isolated single
cells that lost their adhesive properties. The primary tumor was
also characterized as KRAS wild-type (codons 12 and 13) and
BRAF mutated (V600E mutation) according to the standard-ofcare analyses.
Clinically, the patient presented at diagnosis a widespread
disease with numerous abdominal and mediastinal metastatic
lymph nodes as well as metastatic lesions in the liver. No bone
metastasis was detected during the cancer follow-up, but no
sensitive examination, such as a bone scan, was performed due
to the absence of any clinical signs. The patient did not respond
to any of both administered treatments (FOLFIRIþbevacizumab
followed by FOLFOXþbevacizumab) and died about 6 months
after the diagnosis due to a disease progression at the peritoneal
(carcinosis) and pulmonary (lymphangitis) sites.

Characterization of a Colon CTC Line

single CTC, but chromosome 2q is only gained in CTC sphere 1,
whereas no aberrations of chromosome 2 could be detected in
CTC sphere 2. Similarly, chromosome 13q seems to be partly
gained in CTC sphere 2, completely gained in CTC sphere 1, but
not aberrated in the single CTC. Finally, the loss of chromosome
17p in CTC sphere 2 was not found in either CTC sphere 1 or the
single CTC.
Transcriptome of single CTC-MCC-41 cells
To characterize the CTC-MCC-41 cell line at the gene
expression level at different time points of cell culture, we
performed single-cell transcriptome analyses exploring 13
different mRNAs. This panel has been selected to cover different known properties of tumor cells: epithelial (EpCAM,
CK19, and E-Cadherin), mesenchymal (Vimentin, Snail,
Twist), stem cells (ALDH-1 and CD133), and angiogenesis
(VEGF) characteristics as well as the expression of the tyrosine
kinase receptor c-Met. In addition, we included the detection
of CD45 mRNA to exclude cells of hematopoietic origin and a
housekeeping gene (beta-microglobulin) as the positive control of the experiment.
All results obtained with CTC-MCC-41 cells at 1, 6, and 13
months of culture were identical and are shown in Fig. 3A.
Like MCF-7 breast cancer cells and HT-29 colon cancer cells
used for comparison, CTC-MCC-41 cells expressed the epithelial markers analyzed. Although expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin and Twist 1 was not detected, CTC-MCC41 cells expressed the EMT inducers Snail, suggesting that
CTC-MCC-41 cells have an intermediate E/M phenotype. In
addition, CTC-MCC-41 cells are also able to express VEGF, a
key player to induce angiogenesis, and c-Met, a proto-oncogene speciﬁc of tumor cells. Interestingly, CTC-MCC-41 cells
expressed osteoprotegerin, a protein characteristic for the
osteomimetism in the bone marrow. This protein is also
expressed by the BCM1 cancer cell line of bone origin used
as a positive control. Finally, no CD45 expression was detected
conﬁrming the nonhematopoietic origin of CTC-MCC-41
cells.
Proteome analyses of the CTC-MCC-41 cells
To deﬁne a speciﬁc phenotype of the CTC-MCC-41 cell
line, we performed ﬂow cytometry and immunocytochemistry experiments at different times of cell cultures (at 1, 3, and
6 months). A large panel of membrane and intracytoplasmic
proteins were screened and the main results are shown
in Fig. 3B.
This CTC-MCC-41 cells expressed strongly epithelial markers
like EpCAM, cytokeratins (CK19 and CK20), whereas no EGFR
was observed. As CK20 protein expression in colon cancer has
been reported for many years (19), we decided to add this protein
marker to our immunocytochemical analyses. With regard to
mesenchymal markers, the cell line showed no expression of
vimentin and N-cadherin. In addition, stem cell markers were
expressed as represented by the presence of FGF2 as well as

CD133, ALDH1, CD44high/CD24low in these tumor cells. Interestingly, CTC-MCC-41 cells expressed VEGF but not the chemokine receptor CXCR4. Finally, these cells were all negative for the
expression of Her2-neu (EGFR2), CD105 (endoglin), CD146
(MUC18), CD309 (VEGFR2), and CD31 (Platelet endothelial
cell adhesion molecule, PECAM-1; data not shown).
As expected from the RNA analysis, CTC-MCC-41 cells did not
express the leukocyte marker CD45, and these cells were also
negative for the early hematopoietic and vascular-associated
tissue marker CD34, indicating that CTC-MCC-41 cells do not
represent circulating hematopoietic progenitor cells or endothelial cells.
Secretome analysis of viable CTC-MCC-41 cells
To assess the cell capacity of the colon CTC line CTC-MCC-41 to
secrete speciﬁc proteins, CTC spheres and single CTCs were
analyzed by performing functional ﬂuoro-EPISPOT assays.
Results described in Fig. 4A and B show that viable tumor cells
were able to release CK19 and osteoprotegerin as well as to secrete
FGF2 and VEGF. Compared with the positive controls, CTC-MCC41 cells released similar amounts of CK19, secreted lower
amounts of FGF2, and higher amounts of VEGF and osteoprotegerin. Moreover, these tumor cells were unable to release EGFR
(data not shown).
Interestingly, we found no differences in the secretion proﬁle
between CTC spheres and single CTCs (data not shown).
In vitro endothelial cell tube formation of CTC-MCC-41 cells
As the CTC-MCC-41 cell line expressed and secreted VEGF, it
was interesting to perform in vitro endothelial cell tube formation. When endothelial cells were cultured for 6 hours with the
basal medium, no tubes were observed, whereas when these
cells were cultured with the complete medium containing
the required growth factors (positive control), in vitro endothelial cell tube formation could be observed (Fig. 5A). When
endothelial cells were then cultured with the basal medium
used for a 48-hour CTC culture (CTC line culture supernatant),
the formation of tube-like structures was observed and
exceeded even the tube formation induced by the positive
control medium. These ﬁndings showed the capacity of the
CTC line to release factors that are able to induce in vitro
angiogenesis (Fig. 5A).
Growth of CTC-MCC-41 cells as xenografts in immunodeﬁcient
mice
To evaluate the potential of the CTC-MCC-41 cells to grow in
vivo and to generate colon tumors, these cells were injected
subcutaneously into immunodeﬁcient mice. After 40 and 42 days,
respectively, two mice had to be sacriﬁced as the tumors had
grown beyond 10% of their body weight (2.19 g and 2.04 g,
respectively). The staining of the xenografts extracted from the
mice with an anti-human keratin Ab showed that these xenografts
contained human tumor cells with the typical morphology of an

Comparison of the CTC-MCC-41 cell line with tumor tissues of
the patients with colon cancer and xenografts
We compared KRAS and BRAF mutations in the primary tumor
and the lymph node metastasis of the patient with colon cancer as
well as the CTC-MCC-41 cell line and the xenografts. We found
the same mutational status in all of these tissues, i.e., KRAS wildtype status (codons 12 and 13) and BRAF mutation (V600E
mutation, 1799T>A).
In addition, we performed comparative analyses of CK20
expression in the primary tumor and the lymph node metastasis
of the patient with colon cancer as well as the CTC-MCC-41 cell
line and the xenografts. CK20 expression was detected in all of
these tissues (Fig. 6). The CK20 staining in the original primary
tumor was focal (Fig. 6B) while the tumor cells of the lymph node
biopsy (Fig. 6D) as well as the CTC-MCC-41 cells (Fig. 3B) and the
xenografts of both mice (Fig. 6E and F) were homogeneously and
more strongly stained.

Discussion
Subgroups of cancer cells can leave the primary tumor, travel
as CTCs to a distant site in the body where they begin to
colonize a new distant tissue, and form metastases (20). A
subset of these CTCs might have a cancer stem cell phenotype,
as recently indicated in xenograft models in breast and lung
cancer (13–16).
This article provides, for the ﬁrst time, the experimental proof
that CTCs isolated from the blood of a patient with metastatic

898 Cancer Res; 75(5) March 1, 2015

colon cancer could give rise to an established stable colon CTC
line. The present characterization at the genome, transcriptome,
proteome, and secretome levels of this colon CTC line named
"CTC-MCC-41" revealed a speciﬁc make-up with interesting
potentials. Besides its capacity to expand ex vivo for more than
16 months, it showed (i) epithelial properties with stem cell–
like characteristics, (ii) an intermediate epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype, (iii) an osteomimetic signature, (iv) in vitro
induction of endothelial cell tube formation, and (v) in vivo
tumor formation after xenografting into immunodeﬁcient
mice.
We applied a negative selection for CTC enrichment on
blood samples from 71 patients with metastatic colon cancer
and cultured all of the CD45 remaining cells in nonadherent
culture conditions. Even if 70.4% (CTC count 1) and 53.5%
(CTC count 3) of the patients were positive for CTCs with the
CellSearch system, only two times CTCs could be expanded ex
vivo, and, interestingly, the required condition was to have a
CTC count of 300. These results showed how challenging it is
to establish a colon CTC line from patients with colon cancer
even with overt distant metastases and may explain why so far
no CTC cultures or cell lines have been reported in the literature. In our study, only one cell line could be expanded for
more than one year and these cells are still alive and grow well
in culture. For this speciﬁc colon CTC-MCC-41 cell line, we
switched from medium 1 to medium 2 after a few days of cell
culture and improved the index of proliferation of the tumor
cells and their long-term survival. This important step has been

omitted for the ﬁrst CTC line, which may explain its loss after 2
months.
To conﬁrm the establishment of this cancer cell line, we
performed genotyping analyses. Copy-number variation analysis
of cultured cells using next-generation sequencing technology
demonstrated that these CTC-MCC-41 cells were cancer cells with
colon cancer–speciﬁc genomic changes. Interestingly, the two
CTC spheres and the single CTC that were investigated showed

several subtle differences among the copy-number changes, indicating that the colon CTC-MCC-41 cell line has a polyclonal
origin. Moreover, we can hypothesize that the changes observed
in the stem cell–like spheres might be more relevant to the
outgrowth of the CTCs.
To characterize the colon CTC-MCC-41 cell line at the gene
expression level, we performed single-cell transcriptome analyses
exploring 13 different mRNAs and covering different known

properties of tumor cells: epithelial, mesenchymal, stem cells, and
angiogenesis characteristics as well as the expression of the protooncogene c-Met. We deﬁned this cell line as epithelial (EpCAM(þ),
CK19(þ), E-Cadherin(þ), Vimentin()). However, it was interesting to observe that several cancer stem cell markers were also
expressed: ALDH1(þ), CD133(þ) as well as Snail(þ), an important
EMT inducer. Thus, as we have a mixture of epithelial and
mesenchymal traits, we can suggest that these colon CTC-MCC41 cells show an intermediate phenotype between epithelial and
mesenchymal. This intermediate phenotype appears to have an
increased potential to form metastases, as recently suggested by
Weinberg and colleagues (21). In addition, the CTC-MCC-41 cell
line was also able to express VEGF, a key inducer of angiogenesis
and c-Met, a proto-oncogene speciﬁc of tumor cells.
Most interestingly, the CTC-MCC-41 cell line expressed
osteoprotegerin which is involved in the osteomimicry. Osteoprotegerin was also found to be expressed on the BCM1 cancer
cell line derived from disseminating tumor cell present in bone
marrow of a patient with breast cancer (22). Previous analyses
of samples of primary tumor and matched bone metastases
of patients with breast cancer showed that only the metastatic
cells express proteins of bone marrow origin such as osteoprotegerin (23, 24). The adaptation of CTCs arriving in the
bone marrow and the subsequent cross-talk between these
CTCs and the host tissue induces the expression of site-speciﬁc
proteins. Thus, there is evidence from other groups that CTCs
acquire expression of osteoprotegerin when they colonize the
bone (25). Therefore, expression of osteoprotegerin by CTCMCC-41 cells is of utmost importance, because it indicates that
these colon CTCs have been already located in the bone
marrow as DTC before to recirculate in the peripheral blood.
This result is consistent with the fact that DTCs are frequently
found in the bone marrow of patients with colon cancer (26),
whereas overt bone metastases are rare in these patients and
were also not detected in the patient from whom the CTCMCC-41 cell line was established.
These results obtained at the transcriptome level were then
conﬁrmed and implemented with additional experiments at the
protein level using ﬂow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, and
functional assays like the EPISPOT and the in vitro angiogenesis
assays. We could show that the CTC-MCC-41 cell line was also
expressing strongly CK20, consistent with the colon origin of
these tumor cells, FGF2 as a well know stem cell growth factor
important for the ex vivo growth of metastatic cells in breast cancer
(27), and CD44 and CD133 as additional stem cell markers.
Indeed, Du and colleagues indicate that CD44 as a potential
marker for CSCs in colorectal cancer (28) and cells with high
expression of CD44 along with CD133 in HCT116 showed
tumor-initiating capability (29). In addition, studies on colorectal
cancer cell lines demonstrated that CD44þ/CD24þ cells showed
greater clonogenic ability in vitro and tumor initiation in vivo (30).
However, the source of cancer stem cells in colorectal cancer is still
controversial (31).
To assess the viable tumor cells and their potential, we optimized new functional EPISPOT assays to show that they were able
to release CK19 and osteoprotegerin as well as to secrete FGF2
and VEGF. These results clearly conﬁrmed their epithelial character and potential bone marrow origin plus their capacity to
secrete actively in vitro a stem cell growth factor and an angiogenic
inducer to initiate tumor cell growth and recruitment of endothelial cells. These very last results were demonstrated by the in

900 Cancer Res; 75(5) March 1, 2015

vitro tube formation after cell culture of primary endothelial cells
with the supernatant of CTC cell culture.
Most importantly, to test the tumorigenicity of the CTC-MCC41 cell line, we inoculated subcutaneously tumor cells into
immunodeﬁciency mice. CTC-derived xenografts were established and human-speciﬁc keratin staining demonstrated their
human origin. During the last year, the growth of CTCs in
immunodeﬁcient mice was still a big challenge but has been
successfully performed by four different groups in breast and lung
cancer, directly after CTC isolation from blood sample or after
short-term ex vivo CTC expansion (13–16).
Finally, the analysis of clinicopathologic characteristics of the
patient from whom we were able to isolate CTCs and establish a
CTC cell line showed that the presence of CTCs was associated with
rapid disease progression. Indeed, this patient had a very short
survival due to a chemorefractory tumor exhibiting several factors
correlated with poorer outcome: a poor differentiation (32) and a
BRAF mutation, well known to be a pejorative marker of poor
prognosis regardless of the administered treatment (33, 34). Importantly, the mutation status of the primary tumor was also conﬁrmed
in the lymph node metastasis, in the CTC-MCC-41 cell line, and in
the xenogafts. At the protein level, we compared expression of CK20
and observed a focal expression in the primary tumor, whereas the
lymph node metastasis, the CTC-MCC-41 cell line, and the xenograft exhibited a strong homogeneous expression of CK20, suggesting a selection of CK20 on metastatic tumor cells.
In conclusion, we were able to establish a colon CTC line stable
for at least 16 months, and this cell line shares important features of
the tumor cells in the patient with colon cancer. These tumor cells
were most likely derived from the bone marrow based on the
osteoprotegerin expression, showed an intermediate epithelial/
mesenchymal phenotype with stem cell–like characteristics (e.g.,
growth as microspheres and expression of cancer stem cell markers), could induce in vitro angiogenesis and tumors in immunodeﬁcient mice. Thus, it is conceivable that we have established a cell
line with important properties relevant for the development and
progression of metastatic disease. Further studies on these cells
could be an important step to better predict the fate of CTCs in
patients with colon cancer and to develop new treatments to target
these aggressive tumor cells. Nevertheless, a current drawback is the
low success rate at which CTC lines can be generated from patients
with cancer. Therefore, optimization of enrichment and ex vivo cell
culture conditions of CTCs remain a key step to allow a larger
number of patients to beneﬁt from this personalized approach.
