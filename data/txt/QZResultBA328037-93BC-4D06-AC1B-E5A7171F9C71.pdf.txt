ABSTRACT
Metformin is under evaluation as a potential anticancer agent. Expression of
total and phospho(Thr172)-adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase-α (AMPKα
and pAMPKα(Thr172) respectively), a main metformin target, was examined in
radiotherapy treated breast cancers and metformin’s ability to modulate Trx system
expression and breast cancer radiosensitivity evaluated in vitro.
AMPKα and pAMPKα(Thr172) expression was assessed using a discovery (n=166)
and validation cohort (n=609). Metformin’s role in regulating radioresponse, and
Trx family expression, was examined via clonogenic assays and Western blots.
Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, cell cycle progression and
apoptosis were assessed by flow cytometry.
High AMPKα expression associated with improved local recurrence-free
(P=0.019), relapse-free (P=0.016) and breast cancer-specific survival (P=0.000065)
and was, from multivariate analysis, an independent prognostic factor from the
discovery cohort. From the validation cases AMPKα expression associated with
relapse-free and breast cancer-specific survival in luminal breast cancers. Metformin
substantially increased radiosensitivity, intracellular ROS levels and reduced Trx
expression, in luminal breast cancer cells, but had little effect on basal phenotype
cells.
In conclusion, high AMPKα expression associates with improved prognosis,
especially in luminal breast cancer. Metformin preferentially radiosensitises luminal
breast cancer cells, potentially due to alterations to intracellular ROS levels via
modulation of Trx family protein expression.

INTRODUCTION

effect is based on interfering with respiratory complex I,
reducing ATP production [3], and leading to the activation
of adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase (AMPK) [4,
5]. Diabetic patients treated with metformin, but not other
anti-diabetic drugs, have reduced incidence and better
survival from cancer of many organs, including colorectal,
liver, pancreatic, rectal, breast, prostate cancer and uppertract urothelial carcinoma [6-12]. However, discordance

Metformin (1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride)
is a biguanide used worldwide to treat type II diabetes and
pre-diabetic syndromes [1]. The physiological mechanism
of its action in diabetes is to enhance glucose utilization,
increase insulin sensitivity and reduce hepatic glucose
production and free fatty acid utilization [2]. Its primary

reported that metformin use was not associated with risk
reduction in systemic progression and all-cause mortality
in patients treated with radical prostatectomy [13-16].
AMPK, a serine/threonine kinase, functions as
an energy sensor and metabolic master switch, and is
activated under conditions of increasing cellular AMP:ATP
ratios, such as hypoxia, heat shock and ischemia [17].
AMPK is a heterotrimeric protein composed of a catalytic
α subunit (63 kDa) and regulatory β (40 kDa) and γ (38
kDa) subunits. Each is expressed as functionally redundant
isoforms including α1, α2, β1, β2, γ1, γ2 and γ3, giving
12 different possible combinations of holoenzyme.
Upon activation, the α subunit is phosphorylated at the
Thr172 residue (reviewed in [18]). Activated AMPK
elevates cellular energy levels by stimulating energy
producing catabolic pathways and inhibiting anabolic
energy consuming pathways. AMPK can be activated
by up-stream proteins including liver kinaseB1 (LKB1)
[19] and ataxia teleangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase
[20]. The activation of AMPK inactivates mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR), a stimulator of cancer cell
growth and proliferation frequently hyper-activated by
genetic alterations in cancer [21]. The anti-tumour effects
of metformin have been shown to be dependent on such
AMPK activation [22-25], however antineoplastic effects
may also be independent of AMPK activation with, for
example, altered NF-kB signalling being implicated [26].
Metformin and AMPK have recently been shown to
be involved in regulating the radioresponse of cancer cells.
Metformin radiosensitised FSaII mouse fibrosarcoma
cells and human breast cancer MCF7 [27], lung cancer
cells A549 and H1299 [28, 29] and preferentially killed
cancer stem cells, by activating AMPK and suppressing
mTOR [27]. AMPK inhibition induced radioresistance
of lung cancer cells A549 and H1299 in normal culture
conditions [28], with glucose starvation reversing this
[30]. AMPK is phosphorylated by irradiation in an
ATM dependent manner [30], but independent of LKB1
[28]. Metformin is reported to be involved in redox
regulation; reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species
(ROS) levels in primary human aortic endothelial cells
by upregulating expression of thioredoxin (Trx) via the
AMPK-FOXO3 pathway [31]. It has also been shown to
inhibit thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip) mRNA as
well as protein expression in HeLa cells [32].
The Trx system is a central enzyme family that
regulates intracellular redox homeostasis and plays an
important role in regulating the effects of irradiation on
cancer cells [33]. Trx is a central part of the Trx system
that also includes thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and Txnip
[34]. Trx is reduced, into its biologically active form, by
TrxR in a NADPH-dependent manner and in turn reduces
oxidized cysteine groups on down-stream proteins [35].
Txnip is the negative regulator of Trx, which directly
interacts with the catalytic active centre to block the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

reducing activity of Trx as well as the interaction between
Trx and its down-stream factors [36].
The aims of this study were to determine the
expression, and clinical importance, of total- and
phospho(Thr172)- AMPKα in early-stage invasive breast
cancer from patients treated with radiotherapy and to
investigate the effect of metformin on the radiosensitivity
of different phenotypes of breast cancer cells, assessing
if changes in redox homeostasis, due to alterations
in Trx system proteins, played a role in any altered
radiosensitivity.

RESULTS
AMPKα and pAMPKα(Thr172) staining location
and frequency – in the discovery cohort
Both pAMPKα(Thr172) and AMPKα demonstrated
a mixture of diffuse and granular cytoplasmic staining.
Heterogeneous staining was shown between, as well as
within, certain tumour cores for both markers, varying
from weak to intense staining. Cytoplasmic staining of
both markers was scored: pAMPKα(Thr172) had a median
H-score of 98, ranging between 0 and 200; and AMPKα
had a median H-score of 93, ranging between 0 and
228. Figure 1A and B illustrates the staining pattern for
both markers. There was a marginal positive correlation
between both markers (r=0.305, P=0.000084). X-tile
bioinformatics software was used to obtain an unbiased
optimal H-score cut-point for each protein based on patient
outcome, and dichotomised H-scores into low and high
scores. The cut-point for pAMPKα(Thr172) was 65 with
30% (48 of 162) of cases having a low score; and the cutpoint for AMPKα was 90 with 49% (80 of 163) of cases
having a low score. A small number of tissue microarray
(TMA) cores were not assessed due to missing cores or
insufficient representative tumour within a core.

Relationship of AMPKα and pAMPKα(Thr172)
expression with clinicopathological variables and
clinical outcome – in the discovery cohort
The expression of AMPKα and pAMPKα(Thr172)
was assessed for association with clinicopathological
variables in the discovery cohort (Table 1). High
AMPKα expression was significantly associated with
smaller tumour size (χ2=3.97, d.f.=1, P=0.046), low
grade (χ2=28.338, d.f.=2, P=0.000001), low Nottingham
Prognostic Index (NPI) score (χ2=18.84, d.f.=2,
P=0.000081) and estrogen receptor (ER) positive status
(χ2=38.69, d.f.=1, P<0.000001). The expression of
pAMPKα(Thr172) was not significantly associated with
any of the clinicopathological variables.

Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that high AMPKα
expression was associated with better outcome in terms
of lower local recurrence risk (P=0.019), longer relapsefree survival (P=0.016) and breast cancer-specific survival
(P=0.000065) (Figure 1C), while pAMPKα(Thr172)
was not associated with breast cancer outcome in this
cohort. Multivariate Cox regression analysis including
tumour size, stage (i.e. TNM stage), grade, node status,
NPI, vascular invasion and ER status (with individual
Kaplan-Meier statistics of P=0.048, P=0.000079,
P=0.000025, P=0.019, P=0.000482, P=0.003 and
P=0.007, respectively), showed that AMPKα expression
was independently associated with breast cancer-specific
survival (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.16; 95% confidence
interval (CI) = 0.04-0.63; P=0.009); and such analysis,
including tumour stage (with individual Kaplan-Meier
statistics of P=0.001), showed that AMPKα expression
was also independently associated with relapse-free
survival (HR = 0.36; 95% CI = 0.15-0.87; P=0.023) (Table
2). AMPKα expression was not, however, independently
associated with local recurrence in multivariate analysis
that included ER status and tumour size (HR = 0.52; 95%
CI = 0.19-1.43; P=0.206).

determined cut-point was 115 with 34% (162 of 479) of
cases having a low score. Similar to the discovery cohort,
high AMPKα expression was significantly associated
with features of good prognosis including low grade
(χ2=43.42, d.f.=2, P<0.000001), low NPI score (χ2=27.32,
d.f.=2, P=0.000001) and ER positive status (χ2=47.68,
d.f.=1, P<0.000001). High AMPKα expression was
also associated with some of the additional biomarkers
available for this cohort, including progesterone receptor
(PgR) positive status (χ2=36.72, d.f.=1, P<0.000001),
and basal-phenotype negative status (χ2=21.53, d.f.=1,
P=0.000003). High AMPKα expression was significantly
associated with older patients (χ2=5.67, d.f.=1, P=0.017),
but not with tumour size (Table 1).
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that high
AMPKα expression was associated with longer breast
cancer-specific survival (P=0.005, Figure 3A), but not
with local recurrence-free (P=0.328) or relapse-free
survival (P=0.057, Figure 2A). In multivariate Cox
regression analysis, including tumour size, stage, grade,
node status, NPI, vascular invasion, ER, PgR, human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and basalphenotype status (with individual Kaplan-Meier statistics
of P=0.041, P<0.000001, P=0.00002, P=0.000005,
P<0.000001, P=0.002, P=0.004, P=0.000428, P=0.002
and P=0.000073, respectively), AMPKα expression was
not independently associated with breast cancer-specific
survival in all breast cancer phenotypes (HR = 0.66; 95%
CI = 0.41-1.07; P=0.089) but significant results were
obtained with the luminal-phenotype group separately and
are described below.

Relationship of AMPKα expression with
clinicopathological variables and clinical outcome
– in the validation cohort
To verify the finding that AMPKα expression was
associated with prognosis in early-stage invasive breast
cancer patients treated by breast-conserving surgery plus
radiotherapy, an independent patient validation cohort was
investigated. The staining pattern of AMPKα was similar
to that of the discovery cohort. The median H-score
was 145 and ranged between 0 and 300. The X-tile

demonstrated that AMPKα expression was independently
associated with relapse-free survival (HR = 0.57; 95%
CI = 0.38-0.86; P=0.008; potential confounding factors:
stage, node status, NPI, vascular invasion and HER2 with
individual Kaplan-Meier statistics of P=0.001, P=0.015,
P=0.000282, P=0.004 and P=0.001, respectively) and

and P=0.000005, respectively) in luminal-phenotype
breast cancer cases when potential confounding factors
were included (Table 3).

As AMPKα expression was significantly associated
with ER, PgR and basal-phenotype status, we further
investigated the prognostic significance of AMPKα
expression in different subtypes of breast cancer in the
validation cohort. As shown in Supplementary Table
S1, of the 609 patients, 77% (n=453) tumours were of
luminal-phenotype, 18% were triple-negative (n=108),
4% (n=26) were HER2+ and 21% (n=117) were basallike. High AMPKα expression was associated with
longer relapse-free survival (P=0.02, Figure 2B) and
breast cancer-specific survival (P=0.004, Figure 3B)
in luminal-phenotype tumours. No similar associations
were identified in the HER2+, basal-like or triplenegative classes. Multivariate Cox regression analysis

cytotoxicity to both cell lines; with an increased level of
cytotoxicity observed with the basal-like breast cancer
MDA-MB-231 cells (surviving fraction (SF)=21.75%
of control, P<0.01) compared to the luminal MCF7
cells (SF=59.14% of control, P<0.01). Interestingly, the
radiosensitisation effect of metformin did not parallel its
cytotoxic effect. Metformin caused little change in the
radiosensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells but a substantial
increase in radiosensitivity of MCF7 cells (sensitiser
enhancement ratio (SER) =1.5 at 1% SF) (Figure 4C). The
SF at 6 Gray (Gy) for MCF7 cells treated with metformin
in combination was 0.03% but 0.55% for radiation alone
(P<0.01, Figure 4C).

As radiotherapy is a crucial component of breastconserving therapy, and to take such IHC based expression
studies forward, we assessed whether metformin, a
known modulator of AMPK activity could affect the
radiosensitivity of different breast cancer phenotypes.
Both MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited similar
radiosensitivities under control conditions (Figure 4A).
The IC50 for metformin in both cell lines, determined
from cell growth curve experiments (data not shown),
was 10 mM. This drug concentration was used for
radiosensitivity studies and was initially assessed for
drug alone cytotoxicity using clonogenic survival. As
shown in Figure 4B, metformin exhibited significant

Metformin elevated intracellular ROS production
in luminal breast cancer cells but not basal
phenotype
To explore the reason for the differential
radiosensitising effects of metformin on breast cancer
cells, intracellular ROS levels were assessed by flow
cytometry. As shown in Figure 5A H2O2 induced ROS to
a similar level in both lines but after metformin treatment,
intracellular ROS levels were elevated to 4- fold of control
in MCF7 cells (P<0.05), with no significant alterations in
MDA-MB-231 cells (P>0.05).
As radiosensitivity can be influenced by the mode of
cell death and by perturbations in cell cycle distribution,
flow cytometry assessments of apoptosis and the cell
cycle were conducted. As shown in Figure 5B and 5C,
metformin had no effect on either cell cycle or apoptosis
of MCF7 cells. In MDA-MB-231 cells, metformin induced
a slight increase in the percentage of necrotic cells (1.94
-fold of control, P<0.05, Figure 5C), however it did not
affect the apoptotic or cell cycle response of this line.

Metformin differentially regulates expression of
Trx family proteins in breast cancer cells
Western blot analysis of Trx, TrxR and Txnip was
conducted to assess whether any altered ROS homeostasis
by metformin might involve the Trx system. The
endogenous expression levels of Trx and Txnip were lower
in MCF7 than in MDA-MB-231, whilst TrxR expression
was similar. Metformin decreased Trx expression levels in
MCF7 but had no effect on MDA-MB-231 cells. In both
cell lines, expression of Txnip was dramatically attenuated
by metformin treatment. TrxR expression was not affected
by metformin treatment in either cell line (Figure 5D).

DISCUSSION
Figure 5: Effects of metformin on ROS level, cell cycle,
apoptosis, and expression of Trx system proteins in
breast cancer cell lines. (A) Flow cytometry analysis of

Retrospective studies have found that use of the
antidiabetic drug metformin in diabetic patients’ results in
a reduced incidence of, and better survival from, breast
cancer [12, 37-39]. However, in a randomized pre-surgical
trial including 200 non-diabetic breast cancer patients, no
alteration to tumour proliferation, as assessed by Ki67,
was observed [40]. Metformin has been reported to be
involved in regulating the radioresponse of a number
of different cancer cell types, including breast cancer,
in an AMPK-dependent manner [27-29, 41]. In order to
assess the possible value of metformin as a sensitiser for
radiotherapy of breast cancer and AMPK as a potential
prognostic factor, the present study first sought to evaluate
the expression of AMPK, the target of metformin, in
radiotherapy treated early-stage invasive breast cancer
patients. Similar to others [42], the current study did
not observe any association between pAMPKα(Thr172)

expression and prognosis. However, when total-AMPKα
expression was assessed, in two independent patient
cohorts, expression was associated with patient prognosis.
The reason why total-AMPKα but not pAMPKα(Thr172)
associated with prognosis is uncertain, but may be due
to the differential phosphorylation patterns that can
occur with AMPK: in addition to Thr172 AMPKα is also
phosphorylated at Thr258 and Ser485 for AMPKα1 and
Ser491 for AMPKα2 [43], expression of pAMPKα at
other phosphorylation sites, rather than Thr172, may be
important for breast cancer prognosis, and should perhaps
be addressed in future work.
Although pAMPKα(Thr172) expression has
been previously studied using immunohistochemical
approaches, total-AMPKα has rarely been assessed.
Small studies in thyroid and breast cancer measured
levels between normal and cancerous tissue [44, 45]
but the current study is the first of its type to determine
associations with clinical outcomes. In both the discovery
and validation cohorts, high AMPKα expression was
significantly associated with low grade, low NPI score
and ER positive status, all of which are indicative of
better prognosis. High AMPKα expression was associated
with patient age in the validation cohort but not in the
discovery cohort. The age distribution was, however,
different in these two cohorts: the age of patients in the
discovery cohort ranged from 31 to 70 vs. 18 to 72 in the
validation cohort; and the number of patients aged 40 or
less occupied 8% of the whole population in the validation
cohort, which is nearly twice of that in the discovery
cohort (4.2%). AMPKα expression was associated
with two additional clinicopathological variables in
the validation cohort: PgR and basal-phenotype status;
these clinicopathological variables were not available for
the discovery cohort. The association of high AMPKα
expression with ER, PgR positive and non basal-like
tumours may indicate differential expression of AMPKα
in different breast cancer phenotypes and requires further
verification.
High AMPKα expression was associated with lower
local recurrence risk, better relapse-free and breast cancerspecific survival. In multivariate Cox regression analysis
AMPKα significantly associated with relapse-free and
breast cancer-specific survival independent of possible
confounding factors in the discovery cohort. AMPKα
expression was significantly associated with breast cancerspecific survival in the validation cohort. As AMPKα
expression was related to breast cancer phenotype, the
importance of AMPKα expression in prognosis of different
subtypes of breast cancer was assessed in the validation
cohort. Interestingly, high AMPKα expression associated
with better relapse-free and breast cancer-specific survival
and in multivariate Cox regression analysis AMPKα
expression was also independently associated with
relapse-free and breast cancer-specific survival in luminal
phenotype breast cancer. Our study is the first to examine
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the expression of total-AMPKα in breast cancer tissue and
to report on its prognostic significance in radiotherapy
treated breast cancer, especially in luminal phenotype
disease.
Interestingly, such phenotype preference is also
observed in the tumour inhibitory effects of metformin,
the activator of AMPK, in breast cancer patients.
Retrospective studies have shown that metformin use is
associated with improved breast cancer-specific survival
of diabetic women with luminal [38] and HER2+ breast
cancers [39], but did not significantly impact survival
outcomes in diabetic patients with triple-negative breast
cancer [46]. As a result, we further assessed the effect of
metformin on the radioresponse of different phenotypes of
breast cancer in-vitro. Luminal breast cancer MCF7 and
basal-like breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells were used
in this study, and when treated by single-dose irradiation
both lines exhibited a similar response. However, when
metformin treatment was combined with irradiation, a
substantial increase in radiosensitivity of MCF7 cells
was observed, with an SER of 1.5, but with little effect
on the radiosensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells. Such
results suggest a possible phenotype related mechanism of
action for metformin, which can apparently radiosensitise
luminal phenotype cells but has limited effect on basal
phenotype breast cancer.
To explore the mechanisms of this interesting
phenomenon, alterations to redox homeostasis were
assessed by examining the change in ROS levels following
metformin treatment. Intracellular ROS production is the
major mediator for low-LET radiation-induced cell killing
in radiotherapy [47]. Metformin induced a significant
increase of ROS levels in luminal breast cancer MCF7
cells but had no effect in basal-like breast cancer MDAMB-231 cells. The differential effects of metformin on
ROS production in luminal vs. basal-like breast cancer
cells may provide a potential explanation for its phenotype
preference in radiosensitisation. Others have reported
upon metformin regulating intracellular ROS levels
but with contradictory findings: metformin reduced the
intracellular ROS level in human aortic endothelial cells
[31]; but elevated it in primary human fibroblasts [48],
which, together with our results, suggest that the effect of
metformin in regulating intracellular ROS production may
be largely dependent upon the intrinsic characteristics of
the different cell types, with no uniform pattern. Current
work suggests that the radiosensitisation effects of
metformin were not attributable to it altering cell cycle
progression or the level of apoptosis. Others have shown,
however, that AMPK deficient cells are radioresistant and
that such resistance is linked to cell cycle progression and
proliferation [49].
Cells have a number of systems available to
regulate intracellular ROS production and maintain
redox homeostasis including the Trx system [33], which
has been shown to be associated with clinical outcome

in radiotherapy treated early stage breast cancer [50].
We performed Western blots to analyse the expression
changes of Trx family proteins in metformin treated
cells: metformin decreased the Trx expression level in
MCF7 cells but had no effect on MDA-MB-231 cells.
Interestingly, Hou et al. demonstrated that metformin
inhibited intracellular ROS by upregulation of Trx
expression via the AMPK-FOXO3 pathway in human
aortic endothelial cells [31], whilst the current study
shows the opposite in breast cancer MCF7 cells, with
metformin increasing ROS production by decreasing Trx
expression. There are probably many factors responsible
for such conflicting results, including the concentration
and duration of metformin exposure (i.e. 250 μM for 24
hours in the endothelial study vs. 10 mM for 48 hours
in the current work), and the particular cell line used;
however, both studies show the importance of Trx in
metformin regulated ROS production. It is also interesting
to note the effect of metformin on Txnip, with metformin
totally abrogating its expression in both cell lines, which is
consistent with previous reports suggesting that metformin
inhibits Txnip expression in human hepatocellular
carcinoma HepG2 and cervical cancer HeLa cells [32], as
well as rat insulinoma INS-1E beta-cells [51].
In summary, the present study shows that high
AMPKα expression is associated with a better prognosis
of early-stage invasive breast cancer patients treated
by breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy in two
independent cohorts. This result was more apparent
in luminal phenotype disease with further in-vitro
characterisations showing that metformin, the activator of
AMPK, induced ROS production in luminal breast cancer
cells possibly through altered Trx system expression; with
little effect in basal phenotype cells. Although further
confirmation is required, both in-vitro and in-vivo, current
results suggest that metformin may be a clinically effective
radiosensitiser and that its use should potentially be
focused on patients with luminal phenotype breast cancer.

excision) and radiotherapy at Nottingham University
Hospitals. Information on clinical history and outcome
is prospectively maintained and patients were assessed
in a standardised manner for clinical history and tumour
characteristics (see Supplementary Table S1). Breast
cancer-specific survival was defined as the time interval
(in months) between the date of primary surgery and death
resultant from breast cancer; local recurrence-free survival
was defined as the time interval (in months) between the
start of primary treatment and date of first histological
confirmation of recurrent cancer (invasive or in-situ) at
any site within the treated breast; relapse-free survival was
defined as the time interval (in months) between the start
of primary treatment and date of disease relapse.
The 166 cases in the discovery cohort were selected
from all of the early-stage primary operable invasive
breast cancer patients treated by wide local excision and
radiotherapy at Nottingham University Hospitals between
1998 and 2006. The selection scheme was based on the
local recurrence cases in a chronologic order, where every
local recurrence case was included in the study: when a
case with local recurrence was chosen, the immediate
following 5 suitable cases without local recurrence were
included. The median age at diagnosis of this cohort
was 56 years (ranging from 31 to 70) and 78% (130 of
166) of patients had stage I disease. The follow-up time
was 171 months (median follow-up time 108 months).
Supplementary Table S1 shows the full clinicopathological
characteristics of this cohort.
The 609 samples in the validation cohort were
chosen from a well-characterised consecutive series of
early-stage invasive breast cancer patients treated at
Nottingham University Hospitals, between 1986 and 1998.
From the initial whole series (n=1802), cases treated by
wide local excision plus radiotherapy were selected
(n=609). The median age of the validation cohort was 54
years (ranging from 18 to 72) and 74% (449 of 609) of
patients had stage I disease. The follow-up time was 247
months (median follow-up time 134 months). Data on a
wide range of biomarkers was available (Supplementary
Table S1); estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor
(PgR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)
and basal phenotype status were available for this cohort
and have been described previously [53, 54], with basal
phenotype being defined as cytokeratin (CK)-5/6 and/
or CK-14 positivity [55]. Current cases were classified
into three molecular subgroups: ER and/or PgR positive
(regardless of HER2 status) was defined as luminal; ER,
PgR and HER2 negative was defined as triple-negative;
and ER and PgR negative plus HER2 positive was defined
as HER2+ [56].
Patient treatment, tissue microarray (TMA)
construction and immunohistochemistry (IHC) are

FC500 MCL flow cytometer system (Beckman, USA).
Data exported from the flow cytometer were analysed
using FlowJo7.6.1 software (Tree Star) to obtain the
median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of each group.

Two human breast cancer cell lines: MCF7 (luminal
subtype), MDA-MB-231 (basal subtype) were used in this
study (both were from American Type Culture Collection).
All cell lines were cultured at 37˚C in a humidified
incubator with 5% CO2. MCF7 (passage window 15)
were maintained in RPMI1640 (Sigma, Dorset, UK)
supplemented with 10% iron supplemented donor calf
serum (PAA laboratories, Austria) and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin (Sigma). MDA-MB-231 (passage window
15) were maintained in minimal essential medium EAGLE
(Sigma) supplemented with 0.1 mM non-essential amino
acids solution (Sigma), 2 mM L-glutamine(Sigma), 1%
penicillin/ streptomycin and 10% iron supplemented donor
calf serum.

Protein extraction and Western blot
Sub-confluent cells, following incubation with
10 mM metformin for 48 hours, were harvested and resuspended in RIPA buffer (Sigma) supplemented with
protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) . A Bio-Rad protein
assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA) was used to
determine the protein concentration of each sample.
Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred
onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5%
(w/v) milk powder in 0.1% PBS/Tween, the nitrocellulose
membrane was incubated with primary antibody at 4°C
overnight. The primary antibodies used in this study were:
goat anti- human Trx antibody (1:1000 dilution; American
Diagnostica, Stamford, CT), mouse anti- human TrxR
antibody [19A1] (1:2000 dilution; Abcam, Cambridge,
UK) and mouse anti- human Txnip antibody (1:1000
dilution; MBL International Corporation, Woburn, USA).
HRP-conjugated β-actin antibody (Invitrogen) was used
as internal control. Membranes were developed with
Amersham ECL reagent (GE Healthcare, UK).

Cell irradiation and clonogenic survival assay
Cells were sub-confluent at irradiation. X-rayirradiation was conducted using an RS225 Xstrahl X-ray
cabinet irradiation system (Xstrahl Limited, UK) with
a single dose of 1, 2, 4 or 6 Gray (Gy). X-rays were
delivered at 195 kV, 10 mA, with a dose rate of 0.87 Gy/
min. The cabinet was fitted with a 0.5 mm copper filter
and used at a 48.4 cm focus-to-skin distance. Sham
irradiated cells were used as controls. Cells were exposed
to 10 mM of metformin (BioVision, Milpitas, CA) for
48 hours prior to irradiation. Cells were then trypsinised
and plated for clonogenic survival assay with six parallel
sets. After 18 days colonies were fixed (50% methanol
in 0.9% saline solution for 15 min followed by methanol
for another 15 min), stained (0.5% crystal violet) and
counted as a survivor if containing more than 50 cells.
Surviving fraction (SF) was calculated as: number of
colonies / (number of cells plated × plating efficiency),
where plating efficiency (PE) was defined as: number of
control colonies obtained / number of control cells plated.
The sensitizer enhancement ratio (SER) was calculated as
the radiation dose yielding 1% SF divided by the radiation
dose giving the same survival where cells were treated
with metformin.

Cell cycle analysis
Sub-confluent cells were treated with 10 mM
metformin for 24 or 48 hours, or treated with metformin
for 48 hours and spared for an extra 24 hours (72 hours),
then collected and fixed in 70% ethanol in PBS overnight.
Fixed cells were then stained using a PBS solution
containing 2.5 μg/ml of propidium iodide and 200 μg/
ml of RNase for 30 min at 37°C and analyzed using a
Beckman Coulter FC500 MCL flow cytometer system
(Beckman, USA).

Annexin V-FITC apoptosis assay
Sub-confluent cells were treated with 10 mM
metformin for 4, 8, 24 or 48 hours. Apoptosis of cells
was then assessed by using an annexin V-FITC apoptosis
detection kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and analyzed using a Beckman Coulter FC500
MCL flow cytometer system (Beckman, USA).

Measurement of intracellular ROS levels
Sub-confluent cells were treated with 10 mM
metformin for 48 hours or, as a ROS positive control, 1
mM of H2O2 for 1 hour then further incubated with the
membrane permeable dye 2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate (H2DCF-DA, Sigma) in fresh medium at a final
concentration of 1 μM for 30 min, at 37˚C. Cells were
then collected and intracellular ROS levels assessed by
measurement of the fluorescence (excitation 500 and
emission 520 nm respectively) using a Beckman Coulter

Spearman rank order correlations were performed to
test the association between expression of AMPKα
and pAMPKα(Thr172). Survival curves were plotted
according to the Kaplan-Meier method and significance
determined using the log-rank test. Multivariate survival
analysis was performed by the Cox proportional hazards
regression model and included only those parameters
that were significant in univariate analysis. Data from invitro experiments were expressed as the mean ± standard
deviation (SD) and analysed using the Student t-test and
ANOVA one-way tests. All differences were deemed
statistically significant at the level of P<0.05. Statistical
analysis was performed using SPSS 21.0 software (IBM,
Armonk, NY).
