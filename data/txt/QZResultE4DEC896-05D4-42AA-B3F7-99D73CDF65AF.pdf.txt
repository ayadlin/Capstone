Abstract

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

SCLC at advanced stage is considered an incurable disease. Despite good response to initial
chemotherapy, the responses in SCLC patients with metastatic disease are of short duration and
resistance inevitably occurs. Although several target-specific drugs have altered the paradigm of
treatment for many other cancers, we have yet to witness a revolution of the same magnitude in
SCLC treatment. Anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin, have definite activity in this disease, and
ganetespib has shown promising activity in preclinical models, but underwhelming activity as a
single agent in SCLC patients. Using SCLC cell lines, we demonstrated that ganetespib (IC50:
31nM) was much more potent than 17-AAG, a geldanamycin derivative (IC50: 16 μM).
Ganetespib inhibited SCLC cell growth via induction of persistent G2/M arrest and Caspase 3dependent cell death. MTS assay revealed that ganetespib synergized with both doxorubicin and
etoposide, two topoisomerase II inhibitors commonly used in SCLC chemotherapy. Expression of
RIP1, a protein that may function as a pro-survival scaffold protein or a pro-death kinase in
TNFR1-activated cells, was induced by doxorubicin and downregulated by ganetespib. Depletion
of RIP1 by either RIP1 siRNA or ganetespib sensitized doxorubicin-induced cell death, suggesting
that RIP1 may promote survival in doxorubicin-treated cells and that ganetespib may synergize
with doxorubicin in part through downregulation of RIP1. In comparison to ganetespib or
doxorubicin alone, the ganetespib + doxorubicin combination caused significantly more growth
regression and death of human SCLC xenografts in immuocompromised mice. We conclude that
genetespib and doxorubicin combination exhibits significant synergy and is efficacious in

that ganetespib and doxorubicin combination therapy may be an effective strategy for SCLC
treatment, which warrants clinical testing.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive form of lung cancer accounting for about
10–20% of pulmonary malignancies, strongly associated with cigarette smoking, poor
survival rates, and early metastatic spreading 1, 2. Operation is seldom performed and
chemotherapy coupled with chest radiotherapy in cases limited to the chest is the mainstay
of treatment for this disease. Although chemotherapy has high response rates of over 50%,
median survival of SCLC is only approximately 10–12 months for patients with extensive
disease and 18–24 months for patients with limited disease 1–3. Only approximately 20% of
patients with limited disease can be cured with chemo-radiotherapy, whereas the rest of the
patients eventually succumb to the disease.

Author Manuscript

In SCLC current standard chemotherapy consists of a platinum compound (cisplatin or
carboplatin) and etoposide. Doxorubicin is an effective anthracycline chemotherapeutic
agent in SCLC, and is widely used in the treatment of numerous other human malignancies,
such as breast cancer, bladder cancer, bone and soft tissue sarcoma, multiple myeloma, and
lymphoma 4. In the past, doxorubicin has been used in regimens including
cyclophosphamide and vincristine (CAV), or cyclophosphamide and etoposide (CDE) 5,
which have similar efficacy to platinum regimens in patients with extensive disease 1.
Recently amrubicin, a second generation anthracycline derivative, has also been shown to
have significant activity in SCLC 2. Other than the intercalation with DNA and inhibition of
topoisomerase II causing DNA strand breaks, doxorubicin can also induce interleukin-8 and
tumor necrosis factor–alpha (TNF-α) in SCLC 6. The mechanisms of resistance to
doxorubicin are multiple and range from overexpression of P-glycoprotein, to activation of
NFkB 7. Novel agents with more selective mechanisms of action are needed in SCLC. So far
no significant activity has been recorded in SCLC with the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors
or other targeted agents, which have significant efficacy in subtypes of non-SCLC and other
tumors 8.

Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP 90) represents an appealing molecular target for the
development of novel anticancer therapies. HSP90 is a chaperone protein which has multiple
functions, and is involved in response to stress, posttranslational folding, stabilization of
mutant oncogenic proteins 9 and plays critical roles in cell growth, differentiation and
survival 10. Tumor cells seem more dependent on HSP90 for proliferation and survival than
normal cells, as oncogenic proteins in tumor cells are often misfolded and require high
HSP90 activity for correct folding 11. Thus tumors tend to be more sensitive to HSP90
inhibition as the latter could cause incorrect folding of oncogenic proteins, followed by

proteasome-dependent degradation that leads to cell growth inhibition and death. Over the
past decade, several small-molecule inhibitors of the chaperone HSP90 have been developed
as potential anticancer agents. Given that numerous oncoproteins have been identified as
HSP90 clients (www.picard.ch/downloads/Hsp90interactors.pdf), HSP90 inhibitors have the
potential to concomitantly block multiple oncogenic pathways by downregulation of HSP90
client proteins, such as AKT, mTOR, MAPK, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),
ErbB2, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK-4) 12, and
receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIP1), etc 13. The multi-target
properties of HSP90 inhibitors have also been shown to be advantageous in terms of
overcoming oncogenic signaling redundancies and drug resistance in several cancers
types 12. In this regard, HSP90 inhibition may be of particular benefit to SCLC patients as
recent NextGen sequencing studies revealed that SCLC often carries multiple genetic
mutations or dysfunctions 14, 15.

Ganetespib (Synta Pharmaceuticals) is a novel small-molecule HSP90 inhibitor with a
unique triazolone containing chemical structure, which is different from the benzoquinone
structure of the first- and second-generation HSP90 inhibitors, such as geldanamycin and its
derivative 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) 16, 17. In comparison with
17-AAG, ganetespib is more potent in inducing rapid degradation of HSP90 client proteins
and sustaining longer inhibitory activity with short time exposure. While the first generation
of HSP90 inhibitors was hampered by poor solubility, significant toxicity and modest
efficacy as single agent 18, ganetespib did not display evidence of cardiac, ocular or liver
toxicity, observed with other HSP90 inhibitors 16, 17, 19. Ganetespib demonstrates significant
tumor growth inhibition or regression in mouse xenograft models as single agent or in
combination therapy 16, 19, 20. It has shown additive or synergistic activities with agents
commonly employed to treat advanced malignances, such as taxanes 20 and etoposide 21.
Preclinical data suggest that HSP90 is the major inhibitor of apoptosis in SCLC, which
makes the SCLC cells particularly sensitive to HSP90 inhibition 22. As a single agent,
ganetespib is currently in phase II clinical trial for relapsed or refractory SCLC
(NCT01173523) but preliminary results do not appear to show significant antitumor activity
(Dr. Leena Gandhi, personal communication).
Here we investigated Ganetespib alone and in combination with doxorubicin in vitro and in
vivo in SCLC models. We demonstrate that there is a synergistic interaction in which
ganetespib potentiates doxorubicin-induced cell death in part by eliciting persistent G2/M
arrest and blocking doxorubicin-induced RIP1 activation.

Results
Ganetespib is more potent than 17-AAG in SCLC cell lines
We examined the single-agent potency of ganetespib in several SCLC cell lines using MTS
assay. As shown in Table 1, ganetespib was more potent than the galdanamycin derivative
17-AAG in most of the tested SCLC lines (approximately 200-fold difference in IC50, Oneway ANOVA, p<0.0001). This is in line with the previous findings of others using a variety
of human cell lines16. The superior potency of ganetespib over 17-AAG has been attributed
to its higher binding affinity to HSP90 and more potent inhibition of HSP90/p2319.

Moreover, co-crystal structure and computational analysis showed that ganetespib binds to
both the closed and open conformations of the ATP pocket lid at the HSP90 N-terminus. In
contrast, restricted by their larger sizes, the ansamycin analogues such as 17-AAG can only
bind the ATP-binding pocket in the open conformation16. The lack of constrain for HSP90
ATP pocket binding may be another reason that ganetespib is more potent than 17-AAG in
vitro. Ganetespib significantly inhibited SCLC cell proliferation and induced cell death in
vitro as revealed by Trypan Blue Exclusion staining (Fig 1A). As observed in previous
preclinical studies in vitro16, the cytotoxic effect could be observed as early as 24hrs in H69
and H146 cells and 48hrs in GLC4 and H82 cells, respectively.
Ganetespib induces persistent G2/M phase arrest in SCLC cells

Author Manuscript

Cell cycle analysis (Fig 1B and 1C) showed that ganetespib induced significant dosedependent cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase in H82 and GLC4 cells. The G2/M arrest was
accompanied by concomitant reduction of G1 and S phase cells. Genetespib also induced
G2/M phase arrest in other SCLC cell lines N592 (Fig. S1A), H128 and H146 tested (data
not shown). Moreover, the G2/M arrest remained persistent 72 hours after ganetespib
washout following 30nM ganetespib treatment for 72hrs, in all 3 tested SCLC cell lines
(GLC4, H82, H146) (Fig. 1D). Ganetespib stays inside tumor cells even after washout (Dr.
Weiwen Ying, Synta Pharmaceuticals, personal communication). The observed persistent
G2/M phase arrest may be, in part, due to the persistent presence of ganetespib inside the
cells. It is foreseeable that the persistent G2/M arrest may contribute to the observed cell
proliferation inhibition and death induced by ganetespib. These findings are consistent with
similar reports in non-SCLC cells16, 20 and confirm that ganetespib exerts strong effects in
modulating cell cycle regulatory proteins that are important for its anticancer activity19, 23.

Ganetespib is synergistic with doxorubicin in vitro
We examined the concomitant combination of ganetespib with two topoisomerase II
inhibitors, etoposide and doxorubicin, which have clinical activity in SCLC. MTS assay
showed that the IC50 of ganetespib, doxorubicin and etoposide in H82 cells were 30nM,
43nM and 220nM respectively (Table S1). The cell viability was analyzed by TO-PRO-3
stain in cells treated with doxorubicin, ganetespib, etoposide and the combination
(ganetespib + doxorubicin or ganetespib + etoposide) (Fig. 2A). In comparison with single
treatments (ganetespib, doxorubicin or etoposide), combination treatments (ganetespib +
doxorubicin or ganetespib + etoposide) significantly reduced cell viability (p values < 0.05,
one-way ANOVA) at all studied time points (24, 48, and 72hrs).

Author Manuscript

The combinational activity was also assessed by the Chou-Talalay method, using seven
different concentrations of ganetespib + doxorubicin or ganetespib + etoposide
combinations, in 3 SCLC cell lines, GLC4, H82 and H69 (Figs. 2B and S2). Combination
indices (CI) were calculated for each dose combinations. A CI < 1 indicated synergy, CI = 1
indicated additivity and a CI > 1 indicated antagonism. A CI < 1 (such as 0.234 for GLC4;
0.67 for H82) was found at low doses of ganetespib and doxorubicin, which inhibited cell
growth by more than 70% (Fig. 2B left panel). Similarly, a CI < 1 of ganetespib and
etoposide (such as 0.654 for GLC4; 0.762 for H82) also led to cell growth inhibition by

more than 70% (Fig. 2B right panel). However, the synergistic activity was less pronounced
in H69 cells (Fig S2).
Cytostatic effects of ganetespib + doxorubicin combination treatment

Author Manuscript

To explore the cytostatic effects of ganetespib + doxorubicin, we examined the cell cycle
distribution in cells treated with the indicated concentrations of doxorubicin, ganetespib, and
the combination of the two drugs. In combination studies, the cells were either treated
concomitantly (drugs added at the same time) or sequentially (ganetespib was supplemented
24hrs after doxorubicin treatment). Similar to H82 and GLC4 cells (Fig. 1B and 1C), all
tested SCLC cell lines displayed G2/M phase accumulation 24hrs after ganetespib treatment
(Fig 2C, Fig S1A, S1B). N592 and H69 cells showed S and G2/M phase accumulation 24hrs
after doxorubicin treatment followed by concomitant S-phase reduction and significant
G2/M phase accumulation at 48- and 72-hr time points (Fig. S1A and S1B), indicating that
the S accumulation is not permanent, and the cells in S-phase may have died or progressed
to G2/M upon the prolonged treatment. In contrast, the observed S and G2/M accumulation
was more stable 48 and 72hrs after doxorubicin treatment in H82 cells. In H82 cells, S phase
accumulation could be observed 24hrs after concomitant doxorubicin + ganetespib
combination treatment followed by S-phase reduction and significant G2/M accumulation,
indicating that similar to the effect of doxorubicin treatment in N592 and H69 cells, H82
cells might also have died at S-phase or progressed from S-phase to G2/M in the
combination treatment. Similar pattern of S and G2/M oscillation was also observed with
sequential combination treatment in N592 and H69 cells, although the S-phase oscillation
was not as prominent as with concomitant treatment (Fig. S1A, S1B). Nevertheless,
sequential combination treatment blocked cells at G2/M phase as effectively as concomitant
combination treatment in H82, N592 and H69 cells (Fig. 2C and Fig. S1A, S1B).

Cytotoxic effects of ganetespib and doxorubicin combination treatment

Author Manuscript

To examine the cytotoxic effects of the ganetespib + doxorubicin combination, TUNEL
staining was performed. More prominent rates of TUNEL-positive cells were found in H82
cells treated with ganetespib (2.45 ± 0.34%) or doxorubicin (3.64 ± 0.48%) than with
vehicle (1.35 ± 0.18%). The combination treatment showed the highest rate of TUNELpositive cells (7.29 ± 0.84%) among all the treatment groups (P <0.0001) (Fig 2D and 2E),
indicating that all three regimens elicited cell death, with the combination treatment being
the most cytotoxic. Similar results were obtained in GLC4 cells (data not shown). Western
blot analysis revealed that Caspase 3 cleavage was more pronounced in H82 and GLC4 cells
treated with doxorubicin, ganetespib and the combination than with vehicle alone (Fig. 3A).
However, the combination treatment did not significantly augment Caspase 3 cleavage in
comparison to doxorubicin or ganetespib single agent treatment, suggesting that part of the
observed TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 2E) in the combination treatment might result from
Caspase 3-independent cell death.
To further investigate the molecular mechanism(s) of increased TUNEL-positive cells in the
combination treatment, we performed protein expression and phosphorylation profiling by
reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis with a panel of antibodies against 113 cancerassociated proteins24, 25. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that several

canonical pathways regulating cell cycle, apoptosis/necroptosis, protein synthesis, and RAS/
MAPK/AKT were altered in all the treatment groups (Fig. S3A and Table 2). In line with
the observed G2/M accumulation, Cyclin B1 (CCNB1)26, PDK1 (PDPK1) Ser217
phosphorylation and FADD Ser194 phosphorylation27 were consistently increased, whereas
β-Catenin (CTNB1) Thr41Ser45 and Pyk2 (PTK2B) Tyr402 phosphorylations were
decreased in doxorubicin, ganetespib and combination treatment groups (Table 2). It is wellestablished that the DNA damage repair protein poly-(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) is
cleaved and inactivated by Caspase 3/7 in Caspase 3/7-dependent apoptosis28. In our
analysis, cleaved PARP was significantly augmented 48hrs after the combination treatment
(Table 2), and western blot analysis showed that cleaved Caspase 3 was constantly elevated
in all three treatment groups (Fig. 3A). To further discern proteins that may mediate the
effects of ganetespib + doxorubicin combination treatment, we applied our RPPA data to
Ingenuity Interactive Pathway (IPA) analysis using available published protein interaction
data. RIP1 (RIPK1) was found to be in the apoptosis/necroptosis networks, where it shows
direct interaction with its known interacting-protein FADD13 and chaperone HSP9029 (Fig.
S3B), in which the former was altered in our experimental settings (Table 2) and the latter
was inhibited by ganetespib. It has been shown that RIP1 acts as a survival or necroptotic
signal when apoptosis pathway is blocked in TNFR1-activated cells30, 31. Interestingly, we
showed that doxorubicin upregulated whereas ganetespib downregulated RIP1 in both H82
and GLC4 cells by western blot analysis (Fig. 3A). As a control, 17-AAG, a geldanamycin
derivative which is different in structure from ganetespib, could also suppress RIP1
expression in GLC4 cells, albeit to a lesser extent than ganetespib (Fig. S4), indicating that
the RIP1 inhibition was potentially the on-target effect of HSP90 inhibitions. This is in
agreement with the stronger growth inhibitory potency of ganetespib as compared to 17AAG as illustrated earlier. To evaluate the significance of RIP1 upregulation in doxorubicintreated cells, we depleted RIP1 using siRNA-mediated knockdown approach in doxorubicintreated H82 and GLC4 cells (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, knockdown of RIP1 by RIP1 #1 or #4
siRNAs sensitized doxorubicin-mediated cell death (Fig. 3 C–D and Fig. S5) to a similar
extent as ganetespib + doxorubicin combination treatment (Fig. 2A), suggesting that RIP1
may confer a survival signal and disruption of RIP1 may be essential in mediating the
synergistic effect.
Synergistic effect of ganetespib and doxorubicin combination in SCLC xenograft model

Author Manuscript

H82 xenografts in immunodeficient nude mice were treated with ganetespib and
doxorubicin, both as single agent and combination. As shown in Fig. 4A, weekly
intravenous administration of the non-toxic dose16, 19 of ganetespib of 150mg/kg induced
tumor regression with a T/C value of 36.1%. Doxorubicin single-agent treatment with
4mg/kg intraperitoneally every other day had a T/C value of 38.9%. Consistent with the in
vitro findings, combination treatment with the same comparable doses and schedules as its
respective single agents resulted in a significantly improved tumor volume reduction with a
T/C value of 14.1%. (P <0.0001; One-way ANOVA). This was accompanied by a prominent
reduction of RIP1 expression in the combination group which was apparently mediated by
ganetespib treatment (Fig. 4B) as documented in our in vitro studies (Fig. 3A). Though not
as prominent as in H82 xenografts, the combination treatment also significantly reduced
tumor volumes with a %T/C value of 37.2 (p<0.008) in GLC4 xenograft experiments (Fig.

S6), validating our finding in another SCLC xenograft model system. Single-agent
ganetespib was well tolerated with increase in body weight of 6.24%. The body weight loss
of mice treated with single agent doxorubicin and combination therapy were −0.35% and
−5.04%, respectively (Fig. S7).
Ganetespib and doxorubicin combination treatment causes more cell death than single
agents in xenograft tumors

Author Manuscript

The xenografts were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. In xenografts treated with
doxorubicin, there were extensive areas of necrosis, and similar rates of necrotic cells were
found in tumors of genetespib treatment group (Fig. 4C). In addition, many cells of
ganetespib-treated xenografts were larger in size with cytoplasmic vacuoles, indicative of
G2/M arrest or dying cells. The presence of G2/M-arrested cells in ganetespib, doxorubicin
and combination treatment groups were revealed by the accumulation of G2/M phase
marker Survivin32. As documented in in-vitro experiments (Fig. 3A), the response to HSP90
inhibition was monitored by HSP70 accumulation18 (Fig. 4B). Importantly, multi-section
evaluation of the H&E stained slides showed that the doxorubicin + ganetespib
combination-treated cells looked smaller than the genetespib- or doxorubicin-treated cells,
which was in line with the finding that xenograft tumors in the combination treatment group
exhibited higher rate of necrotic cells than either single agent treatment groups (Fig. 4C).

Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated that ganetespib is a potent HSP90 inhibitor in SCLC cells,
and that ganetespib and doxorubicin are synergistic in vitro and in SCLC xenograft models.

HSP90 inhibition initiates G1/G0 arrest in Rb-positive cells. In contrast to the DNAdamaging drug doxorubicin, inhibition of HSP90 in many Rb-negative cell lines has no
effects on cell cycle progression, or induces slight accumulation at the G2/M checkpoint33.
Most of the SCLC cell lines employed in this study are Rb-negative (Table S2). The fact that
ganetespib elicited G2/M arrest in the tested SCLC cell lines raises the possibility that
ganetespib, like doxorubicin, may cause DNA damage which in turns triggers G2/M
checkpoint arrest. However, we did not see significant induction of the DNA damage marker
γH2AX in ganetespib- or 17-AAG-treated GLC4 and H82 cells (Figs. S4 and S8),
suggesting that ganetespib may not induce G2/M arrest via damaging DNA. Many G2/M
regulators, such as Cyclin B, Cdc2 and Cdc25 are known HSP90 client proteins
(www.picard.ch/downloads/Hsp90interactors.pdf). It remains to be investigated whether
degradation of those regulatory proteins may also play a role in ganetespib-induced G2/M
arrest.

Author Manuscript

Although previous studies showed that geldanamycin analogs DMAG and 17AAG
synergized with doxorubicin by abrogating doxorubicin-induced G2/M arrest via
downregulation of Chk1 followed by apoptosis in p53 mutant lymphoma and leukemia cell
lines34, 35, contradictory results were reported in other p53-null HL60 and U937 cells36, 37.
In this study, ganetespib synergized with doxorubicin in the absence of G2/M checkpoint
abrogation in the p53 mutant/RB negative H82 and H69 cells, suggesting that synergistic
mechanism(s) may vary in different cell types.

In general, HSP90 inhibitor-induced cell cycle arrest has been thought to be reversible,
although this issue has not been thoroughly addressed. In a subset of cancers, such as SCLC
and multiple myeloma cells, it has been shown that HSP90 inhibitors induce apoptosis22, 38.
We observed two distinct responses to ganetespib: cell cycle arrest and cell death.
Ganetespib-induced G2/M arrest was persistent 72 hrs after drug washout or 6 days from the
start of drug treatment (Fig. 1D). It is plausible that the high potency of ganetespib in most
of the cancer cell lines tested17, 18, 39, 40 may in part be attributed to its persistent cell cycle
arrest.

RIP1 is an HSP90 client protein13 and known to interact with FADD 29. FADD Ser194
phosphorylation was altered in all the treatment groups in our study (Table 2). Ingenuity
pathway analysis of our RPPA data revealed that RIP1 may be involved in the apoptotic/
necroptotic response of doxorubicin and ganetaspib treated SCLC cells. In line with this, we
showed that RIP1 expression was upregulated in doxorubicin-treated SCLC cells. Depletion
of RIP1 by siRNA enhanced cell death induced by doxorubicin, suggesting that the role of
RIP1 in this experimental setting may be to mediate a survival signal. As disruption of
HSP90 function by ganetespib caused significant reduction of RIP1 expression (Fig. 3A),
one of the potential mechanisms by which ganetespib synergizes with doxorubicin in
inhibiting SCLC cell growth may be through downregulation of RIP1. High expression of
RIP1 has been reported to contribute to resistance to TNFα-induced apoptosis through
activation of NFkB pathway13, probably via regulation of IκB degradation41. Doxorubicin
has been reported to induce NFkB activation, which may render cells either resistant7 or
sensitive42 to the drug. It is conceivable that ganetespib could counteract the effect of
doxorubicin on NFkB activity, as western blot analysis revealed that doxorubicin modestly
decreased and ganetespib increased the abundance of IκB-α, an inhibitor of NFkB
pathway41 in GLC4 cells (Fig. S9A). However, siRNA-mediated RIP1 depletion did not
significantly alter the abundance of IκB-α (Fig. S9B), suggesting that the negative effect of
ganetespib on NFkB activation, if any, may not require RIP1. How the downregulation of
RIP1 by ganetespib may play a role in doxorubicin sensitization will require additional
investigation. Taken altogether, our data suggest that ganetespib may sensitize doxorubicininduced cell death in part through inhibition of RIP1 activity and induction of persistent
G2/M phase arrest.

Combination chemotherapy remains the mainstay treatment for most tumors. Standard first
line chemotherapy regimens for SCLC include platinum containing doublet regimens
(etoposide and cisplatin or carboplatin, and irinotecan and cisplatin mainly in Japan)43, 44,
and also doxorubicin containing regimens (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine,
CAV45, 46, and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, CDE43, 44. Platinum doublets
have been preferred more recently because of easier coadministration with radiation therapy
in patients with limited disease. SCLC patients are highly sensitive to initial chemotherapy,
however, the overall prognosis has improved little over the past two decades, mainly
because the response to treatment is often short and the prognosis of relapsed patients who
receive second-line therapy, such as topotecan or CAV, is poor1, 47. The novel anthracycline
amrubicin has been shown to have definite antitumor activity in platinum-refractory
SCLC48, but randomized studies in second line and in first line have failed to show
significant advantages against standard chemotherapy49.

The mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapies are still largely unknown50, and there is an
urgent need to develop more effective first- and second-line therapeutic regimens that would
circumvent these resistant mechanisms. In this study, we showed that ganetespib and
doxorubicin combination exhibited significant synergy in inhibiting the growth of SCLC
cells in vitro and in mouse xenografts. The efficacy of the combination treatment and the
potential involvement of RIP1 to mediate the synergy discovered in this study suggest that
ganetespib may enhance the effects of doxorubicin and potentially attenuate the occurrence
of resistance. Clinical studies of a combination of ganetespib and doxorubicin are warranted
in SCLC patients with extensive disease.

RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C in 5%CO2
incubator. Cell viability was assessed by Trypan Blue staining (Life technologies, Grand
Island, NY). Doxorubicin (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA), etoposide (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) and ganetespib (STA-9090) (Synta Pharmaceuticals, Lexington, MA) were
dissolved in DMSO according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cell cycle analysis

Author Manuscript

Cells were seeded in 25cm2-flasks at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml. Before collection, cells
were washed with cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with cold 70% ethanol in
PBS followed by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in 500 μl propidium iodine in
PBS (10 μg/ml) containing 300 μg/ml RNase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Cells were then
incubated for 30min with gentle shaking and filtered with 40 μm nylon mesh (BD Falcon,
CA). Cells were acquired by FACScalibur using Cellquest Pro software (Becton Dickinson
and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and cell cycle distributions were analyzed using ModFit
LT™ software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME).
siRNA transfection

Author Manuscript

Four different RIP1 small interfering RNAs (siRNA): # 1
(SI00288092:TACCACTAGTCTGACGGATAA), #2
(SI02621983:CCGACATTTCCTGGCATTGAA), #3
(SI04437860:TCCGTTAACGTTAATACCCAA), #4
(SI00056014:CAGCTGCTAAGTACCAAGCTA); negative control siRNA (Catalog no.
1027281) and cell death control siRNA (Catalog no. 10272299) were purchased from
Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Transfection of siRNA was carried out using 0.2% Lipofectamine
(Life technologies, Grand Island, NY). H82 and GLC4 cells were seeded at a density of 3 ×
105 cells/ml in a 6-well tissue culture dish and transfected with siRNA-Lipofectamine
mixture (5nM, 10nM or 15nM siRNA).

TO-PRO-3 viability assay

Author Manuscript

106 cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed in PBS twice. TO-PRO 3™ iodide
(Life technologies, Grand Island, NY) was added at a final concentration of 500nM to the
cells in PBS immediately before analysis. Cells were acquired using a FACSCalibur flow
cytometer (Beckton Dickinson) and analyzed by FlowJo (Tree Star, Ashland. OR).
MTS assay

Author Manuscript

Briefly, 20,000 cells in 200μl media were dispensed into each well of 96-well flat-bottom
plates. Plates were subsequently incubated for 72hrs with different concentrations of drugs.
10μl of MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) reagent was added to each well. Two or three hours later,
absorbance at 490nm was measured by a multi-well plate reader (Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, CA). Experiments were repeated at least three times. The cell viability was
obtained by normalizing the absorbance of the treated samples with that of the controls and
expressed as percentage, assigning the viability of non-treated cells as 100%. Survival
curves were constructed using Prism V5.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA), and IC50s
were calculated.
Cytotoxic combination effects of doxorubicin, etoposide and ganetespib were assessed with
7 different concentrations of drugs (3.75, 2.25, 1.5, 1, 0.67, 0.44, and 0.27 × IC50).
Combination indexes (CI) were calculated using CalcuSyn (Biosoft, UK). The Chou-Talalay
method was used, that defines additive effect (CI = 1), synergism (CI < 1), and antagonism
(CI > 1) of drug combinations 51.
Western blot and antibodies

Author Manuscript

Following treatment, tumor cells were harvested, centrifuged and washed with cold PBS.
Lysates were prepared with RIPA buffer on ice, equal amounts of proteins were dissolved in
SDS-PAGE and Western blot was performed as described previously 52. The intensities of
band signals were assessed using GeneTools software (SynGene, Frederick, MD) and
normalized by the intensity of α-tubulin. All antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology (Danvers, MA).
In vivo xenograft tumor models and drug administrations

Author Manuscript

Two-week-old athymic immunodeficient nude mice were maintained in the pathogen-free
facilities of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and cared in accordance with the NIH
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Mice were subcutaneously implanted
with 8 × 106 NCI-H82 or GLC4 cells and left to grow for 2 weeks to a volume of about 80–
100mm3. Eligible mice were randomized into treatment groups of 8. Doxorubicin was
administered by intraperitoneal injection of 4mg/kg, 3-times a week for 3 weeks. Ganetespib
(STA-12-1474 for in vivo study from Synta Pharmaceuticals) 16, 20, formulated in PBS and
PH-adjusted to neutral just before use in order to prevent precipitation, was injected
intravenously via tail vein. Mice were treated with ganetespib at 150 mg/kg weekly for 3
weeks.

a week. Tumor volumes were calculated using
formula. The T/C value
was determined from changes in average tumor volumes of drug-treated groups relative to
vehicle-treated groups.
TUNEL stain

Author Manuscript

Approximately 106 cells treated with 40nM doxorubicin, 30nM ganetespib, 40nM
doxorubicin + 30nM ganetespib combination or vehicle, were harvested, centrifuged,
washed in PBS, resuspended with 30 μl PBS and added to poly-L-lysine-coated slides, and
left to air-dry in a tissue culture hood for approximately 1–2hrs before fixation. The terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) was performed using the
DeadEnd™ Colorimetric TUNEL System Kit (Promega, Madison, WI), following the
manufacturer’s protocol.
Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) analysis
H82 cells were treated with 40nM doxorubicin, 30nM ganetespib, 250nM etoposide, the
combination of 40nM doxorubicin + 30nM ganetespib, or 250nM etoposide + 30nM
ganetespib for 24 and 48hrs respectively. Cell lysates were prepared as previously
described 53. Samples derived from drug treatment and control groups were printed in
triplicates onto the same arrays of nitrocellulosecoated slides, and probed with 113
antibodies targeting cancer-associated total and phosphorylated proteins respectively as
described previously 24, 25. Final signal intensities were obtained after background,
secondary antibody subtraction and normalization to the total amount of protein present in
each individual samples 53.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) or
GraphPad Prism V5.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Comparisons of categorical
variables between the different groups were made using the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact
test, when the number of cases was fewer than five. The paired Student’s t test for
continuous variables was performed for means between paired groups. Comparison of drug
efficacy and potency in different treatment groups was carried out by one-way analysis of
variances (ANOVA). All p values were two-sided and p values of < 0.05 were regarded as
significant.

Author Manuscript

For RPPA data analysis, the Ward method for two-way unsupervised hierarchical clustering
was performed using JMP v5.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). One-way ANOVA with
Dunnett’s Multiple Comparison Test (Prism v5.0b, GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA)
was applied to compare values of treatment groups with those of control group. P values <
0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Values are the mean ratios derived from mean values of each treatment groups divided by mean values of the untreated control groups. Only ratios of ≤ 0.7 or ≥ 1.3 with p values < 0.05 (One-way ANOVA
with Dunnett’s Multiple Comparison Test) were considered significant and shown. Empty cells indicate no change in the ratio of the analysed proteins. No Txt, no treatment; Doxo, doxorubicin; Gane,
