BACKGROUND. Cerebral metastases are clinically significant in 10% to 30% of patients
with neoplasia. Multiple cerebral metastases are typically treated with palliative radiotherapy. There is no consensus on the role of enhanced chemotherapy delivery as an
adjuvant treatment modality in this disease. In this report, the authors detailed their
experience with intraarterial (IA) chemotherapy infusion with and without blood-

METHODS. From November 1999 to May 2005, 38 patients with multiple cerebral metastases were enrolled in a prospective study. Patients were treated with IA carboplaadministered IA methotrexate. Osmotic BBBD was offered to patients without the presence of a significant mass effect. These regimens were coupled with intravenous etoposide and cyclophosphamide. Cycles were repeated every 4 weeks.

RESULTS. Survival was calculated from study entry and radiologic response was based
on MacDonald criteria. Kaplan-Meier estimates were generated for all subgroups.
Mean and median survival obtained was as follows: 34 and 29.6 months for the whole
group; 33.6 and 42.3 months for ovarian carcinoma; 15.3 and 13.5 months for lung
adenocarcinomas; 8.3 and 8.8 months for small cell lung carcinoma; 8.9 and 8.1
months for breast carcinoma; and 24.8 and 16.3 months, respectively, for cerebral metastasis from systemic lymphoma.

CONCLUSIONS. Even with a small number of patients in each subgroup, the results
obtained seem promising for multiple brain metastasis of ovarian carcinoma, adenocarcinoma of lung, small cell lung carcinoma, and systemic lymphoma. Cancer

rain metastases are the most common intracranial tumors among
adults. They occur in 20% to 40% of cancer patients, which represents over 170,000 new cases per year in the US.1,2 The metastatic
process to the central nervous system (CNS) usually implies an
uncontrollable disease, and typically represents an exclusion criterion
in most Phase II and III clinical studies. The emergence of cerebral
metastasis significantly impacts the quality of life of the patient, producing neurological morbidity.3 More so, it adversely impacts survival,
as their presence entails per se a poor prognosis. According to the recursive-partitioning analysis (RPA) of the Radiation Therapy Oncology
Group (RTOG), median survival of brain metastases patients ranges
between 2 and 7.1 months, thus illustrating the poor prognosis
observed in these patients.4
Most patients will present with multiple lesions.5,6 Magnetic resonance imaging-based studies reveal that approximately 80% of patients

have more than 1 metastasis at presentation. In these
patients the approach is usually considered palliative,
and whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is offered
in an attempt to briefly stabilize disease progression.
However, the role of radiotherapy remains controversial.7 Even though this treatment modality has been
shown effective for local tumor control, survival benefits
have been modest, ranging from 3 to 5 months.4–6 More
so, WBRT has been associated with significant side
effects.8,9
Chemotherapy has been of limited use in patients
with brain metastasis because of the blood-brain barrier
(BBB). The delivery impediment of therapeutic molecules related to the physicoelectric characteristics of the
BBB and the activity of efflux pump systems is such that
a significant area under the curve is hard to maintain.10–12
Based on the rationale of bypassing the BBB, different
approaches have been proposed.13 One such approach
consists of increasing the effective concentration of a
chemotherapy agent by intraarterial (IA) administration.
By doing so, this regional delivery paradigm increases
local plasma peak concentration and local area under the
curve, ultimately translating into a 3 to 5.5  factor
increase in intratumoral concentration.13,14 This strategy
can also be augmented by manipulating the BBB permeability through different means.15,16 To date, there is no
consensus on the role of these approaches in the treatment of brain metastases. We hereby relate our experience with the IA administration of chemotherapy in
cerebral metastatic disease, with and without osmotic
blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This prospective Phase II study was conducted at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke (CHUS) from
November 1999 to May 2005. The protocol was approved

were eligible. All histological subtypes were allowed,
except notoriously chemoresistant histologies, such as
hypernephromas and melanomas.
Eligibility criteria also included a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) >50 and measurable disease on
initial contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT)/
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Prior radiotherapy
and chemotherapy was allowed. The complete list of
inclusion criteria is detailed in Table 1. The primary
endpoint of this study was survival.
After enrollment and initial evaluation, patients
were treated every 4 weeks (1 cycle) for up to 12 cycles.
The procedure was accomplished in a standardized way.
After general anesthesia, a catheterization via transfemoral puncture of either the right or left carotid or vertebral artery was performed, the parent vessel(s) used
depending on the tumor(s) location. Before appropriate
vessel selection a diagnostic angiogram was obtained in
the vessel(s) of interest. However, a 4-vessel angiogram
was not performed routinely. The catheter was placed at
the level of C1-C2 for carotid and at the level of C5-C6
for vertebral circulation. After determination of the adequate infusion rate for mannitol infusion to open the
barrier, mannitol was infused at high flow over 30 seconds in the selected artery. During this infusion the
whole vascular tree in the selected distribution was filled
with mannitol, whereas reflux in the common and external carotid artery was kept to a minimum. The chemotherapy was then infused at a rate calculated to prevent
streaming.16
Two different chemotherapy regimens were used
based on tumor histology. Methotrexate (5 gm), for systemic lymphomas, or carboplatin (400 mg/m2) for all
other histologies, was infused via the catheter. Both regimens are detailed in Table 2. Leucovorin rescue was used
with the methotrexate protocol. All patients received
Neupogen (5 mg/kg subcutaneous daily) for 7 days.

Other circumstances

Because the procedure induces a transitory increase
in intracranial pressure, only 1 vascular territory could
be disrupted per session. Thus, patients with multiple
metastases covering more than 1 vascular distribution
were approached as follows: different vascular distributions were treated alternately from cycle to cycle. The
presence of a significant mass effect, as exemplified by a
closed quadrigiminal cisterna, dilatation of the contralateral ventricular system, or uncal herniation, represented an absolute contraindication to BBBD. Some
patients presenting an excessive mass effect but otherwise meeting all the inclusion criteria were offered IA
chemotherapy without BBBD (Table 3). In this setting,
general anesthesia is not required, and as the BBB is not
breached the chemotherapy dose was equally split
between each vascular distribution treated, thus covering all lesions for each cycle.
All patients were monitored with complete blood
and platelet counts every week. A biochemical, kidney
and liver function profile, and electrolyte assessment was
requested every 4 weeks. Neurological and general examination was performed before each cycle. Assessment of
overall response was based on tumor evaluation from
CT/MRI scans obtained before each treatment and interpreted according to the MacDonald criteria (Table 4).
Data were prospectively collected from study entry and

Statistical Analysis
Mean and median survivals from study entry were calculated from the first cycle of treatment to death or May
1, 2005. Based on these, Kaplan-Meier estimates were
also extrapolated.

RESULTS
Descriptive Data
From November 1999 to May 1, 2005, 38 patients were
accrued in this study and grouped in 5 distinct histological classes (Table 5).
The median age was 55, 9 years (20–74 years) for
the whole group at enrollment, and there were 25
women (65.8%) and 13 men (34.2%). These 38 patients
were submitted to 199 procedures (mean of 5.2 cycles
per patient). Nineteen were exposed to BBBD, whereas
the remaining 19 patients were treated with IA chemotherapy. On accrual, 63.2% of patients had received
radiotherapy and 73.7% had already been exposed to
chemotherapy for their primary disease (Table 6). The
agents used were: carboplatin, cisplatin, etoposide,
taxol, topotecan, 5FU, navelbin, vincristine, vinblastin,
and adriamycin. In an attempt to characterize our study
population prognostically, we stratified our patients
according to the RTOG partitioning analysis classes.
Three patients were stratified as class 1, 18 as class 2,
and 17 as class 3. Overall, 92.1% of patients were in
classes 2 or 3 (Table 7). The mean number of metastatic
lesion was 3.5 lesions per patient.
Tumor Response, Time to Tumor Progression (TTP),
and Overall Survival
The mean overall survival from diagnosis of brain metastases was 34 months, whereas median overall survival
was 29.6 months. Mean and median overall survivals
from study entry were, respectively, 19.9, and 13.5

months, for the entire group of patients (Fig. 1). Figure 2
summarizes the assessment of best radiological
response to the treatment for each group based on MacDonald criteria. Twenty-three patients (60%) progressed
during treatment, for a mean TTP of 127 days. Interestingly, of 10 patients already exposed to systemic administration of drugs used in our regimen, 7 showed a
response, 1 patient remained in stable disease (SD), and
2 progressed.

Lung Carcinoma (n = 18)
Lung metastases patients presented a median survival
of 11.2 months. Two histological subgroups were identified and analyzed separately. Adenocarcinomas (n ¼ 9)
depicted a mean and median survival time of 15.3 and
13.5 months, respectively. The best response to treatment was 1 major partial response (MPR) and 4 partial
response (PR). For small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC)
patients (n ¼ 9), we observed 1 complete response
(CR), 2 MPR, and 3 PR, with 8.3 months of mean and 8.8

months of median survival (Fig. 3). As SCLC patients
typically presented with multiple lesions and a significant mass effect related to peritumoral edema, all were
treated with IA chemotherapy, without BBBD.

Lymphoma (n = 8)
Systemic lymphoma patients with brain metastasis presented an average and median survival of 24.8 and 16.3
months, respectively. Two patients completed the full
treatment regimen (12 cycles), and are still in CR after
57.2 and 51.9 months (Fig. 4). Interestingly, 7 of 8
patients presented a response.

This group showed an average and median survival of
33.6 and 42.3 months, respectively. These patients presented and all or non-behavior when studying radiological responses, in that 4 of them had a CR, whereas 1

revealed the diagnosis of an oat cell carcinoma. The patient was exposed to 8 cycles of intraarterial chemotherapy and presented a complete response (CR) (lower row).
The white arrows depict areas of hypointense signal related to encephalomalacia. These regions correspond to areas where significant tumor nodules were present before

Two of these 5 patients are still in CR with a follow-up of
34.1 and 27.8 months (Fig. 5). None of the responders
had been exposed to radiation therapy.

Breast Carcinoma (n = 4)
A mean and median survival of 8.9 and 8.1 months,
respectively, were observed. Best radiological response
observed was 1 PR. The 3 other patients progressed.
Complications and Adverse Events
For the present study, adverse events are classified in 2
distinct categories: hematologic toxicity and adverse
events associated with the procedure itself. In terms of
hematologic toxicity, we observed 1 grade 3 occurrence
of anemia and 1 grade 4 thrombocytopenia according to
the National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria.
Two occurrences of grade 3 and 1 of grade 4 neutropenia
were also observed. Three adverse events related to the
procedure were recorded. One occurrence of severe neck
pain after perfusion of chemotherapy in the vertebral artery was observed in a patient treated with IA chemotherapy without BBBD. This syndrome was controlled with
steroids. Two patients presented with a postinfusion orbital pseudotumor syndrome.17 Their condition completely recovered after high-dose steroids.

DISCUSSION
Brain metastases occur in 20% to 40% of cancer patients
and are associated with a dismal prognosis. Typically,
patients with multiple brain metastases are exposed to

WBRT as a palliative measure.1,2,6 The rationale supporting the use of this approach relies on the demonstration
that it has a high potency of controlling neurological
symptoms.18 However, survival improvement is modest,
ranging from 3 to 5 months.3,5 This survival has not
been altered despite 3 decades of clinical research
aimed at improving outcome for these patients.6 The
short median survival benefit has to be weighed against
the possibility of inducing side effects such as fatigue,
alopecia, and transient worsening of neurological symptoms.5,6,8 More worrisome are the risks of inducing
delayed toxicity such as diffuse cerebral injury, producing progressive dementia, gait ataxia, and sphincter
dysfunction in the few patients presenting a long-term
survival.16 DeAngelis et al.9 described an incidence of
radiation-induced dementia of 1.9% to 5.1% in patients
with brain metastases. This was probably an underestimate, as only the most severely affected patients were
identified and no formal neurocognitive testing was
accomplished. These side effects need to be considered
in light of the palliative context.
The role of standard chemotherapy in the treatment
of brain metastases has always been marginal, as penetration of the chemotherapy agent beyond the BBB is
limited.11 By way of its anatomic and physiologic properties, the normal BBB prevents passage of ionized
water-soluble compounds with a molecular weight
greater than 180 Da.19 Although the integrity of the barrier is often compromised within or around tumors, this
alteration in permeability is variable and heterogeneous,
nonetheless greatly limiting drug penetration.19 More

(cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) and abdominal radiotherapy, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan showed no residual disease. Two
months after the completion of radiation therapy he presented a left-sided sensory seizure. After investigation, a right parietal lesion was uncovered (A), biopsied, and a
confirmatory diagnosis of B-cell lymphoma was made. The patient was enrolled in our study and underwent 12 cycles of blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD) in conjunction with the methotrexate regimen. At study cutoff he was still in complete response (CR), 51 months after his inclusion in the study (B).

gynecologic surgery, followed by 6 cycles of taxol/carboplatin. She presented a seizure in May 2002 and a metastatic lesion was identified in the right parietal region. She
underwent a craniotomy for tumor resection, followed by 8 cycles of the carboplatin regimen in conjunction with blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD). She was considered
in complete response (CR) after 2 cycles, and that condition was maintained until December 2005, when she experienced recurrence in the right temporal lobe. (A) BBBD
treatments were resumed and she was considered in CR after 3 cycles (B).

so, drug distribution is uneven, with a preferential accumulation in the necrotic areas of the tumor.5 Drug penetration at the edge of the tumor is nonexistent, as has
been shown in a study using fluorescein as a marker
of permeability.20 The presence of the P-glycoprotein
(P-gp) efflux pump at the luminal surface of the brain
capillaries and the constant flow of cerebral spinal fluid
(CSF) emanating from perivascular spaces further contribute to a decrease in the actual concentration and time
of exposure of tumor cells to chemotherapy. Interestingly,
despite the fact that this limitation in delivery imposed
by the barrier is more and more acknowledged, it remains
underdiscussed in the field of neurosciences.11,12

Intraarterial Chemotherapy and BBBD
Different approaches have been advocated to improve
delivery across the BBB. One such approach has been
extensively tested in the clinic, and is commonly used
by our team, both in the preclinical and clinical setting.
It involves the IA infusion of chemotherapy with or
without prior administration of a hypertonic solution to
produce a transient increase in permeabilization of
the barrier in a given cerebrovascular distribution.15,16
The so-called IA chemotherapy infusion refers to the
regional delivery of chemotherapy to the CNS, which
produces a significant increase in plasma peak concentration and in the area under the curve related to the
first pass effect.13 This translates in a significant increase
in intra-tumoral chemotherapy concentration by a 3–
5.5-fold factor, as most of these lesions are highly vascularized.19 Newton et al.13 reported their experience with
IA chemotherapy in a group of 27 patients exposed to IA
carboplatin and IV etoposide. All the patients in this series had been exposed to radiation before enrollment,
and 67% had been exposed to chemotherapy. The
authors reported a 54% response rate and a 20-week
median survival from study initiation. This lead to an
impressive TTP of 16 weeks in the cohort, thus validating this approach as promising in the treatment of this
patient’s population. Doolittle et al.21 reported their
results on brain metastases treatment as part of a
broader series. Although not specified in the article,
most of those patients had been treated by IA chemotherapy without BBBD. Thirteen patients with brain metastasis of unspecified histology were so treated with the
following results: 3 CR, 2 PR, and 5 SD. However, no
details as to the specific histology in relation to response
and duration of response are given for this subset of
patients, thus greatly limiting the reach of the results.
One way to further increase delivery is to add an osmotic manipulation of the BBB to the IA chemotherapy
infusion. The permeation of the BBB is obviously transitory (30 minutes to 2 hours according to experimental
data), but lasts for a sufficient time to allow the IA infu-

757

sion of a therapeutic molecule.19 The procedure would
also allow a transient decrease in the function of the Pgp pump, thereby allowing for improved delivery of
chemotherapy agents that are also known substrate of
this pump.22 Even if the barrier is breached in the
tumoral tissue, its integrity remains virtually intact at
the periphery of the tumor.19 Sato et al.20 elegantly
demonstrated in vivo that the mannitol infusion increases the permeability of the barrier at the edge of the
tumor, in the peritumoral area. Recently, we reported
encouraging results obtained with malignant glioma
patients using the BBBD procedure.16 Fragmentary data
were also available on a group of 10 patients with brain
metastasis. The median survival time from study entry
was 9 months. Interestingly, the extent of the increase in
permeability has been shown to correlate with longterm survival in a population of lymphoma patients
treated with the BBBD procedure combined with IA
methotrexate infusion.23 In that study the authors
clearly established a relation between the clinical outcome of the patient and the intensity of delivery
obtained by the procedure, emphasizing the relevance
of improving delivery strategies.
As stated earlier, the selection of patients directed
toward BBBD was partially based on the presence of a
significant mass effect, and some patients were denied
BBBDs but were offered IA chemotherapy based on that
criterion. Because BBBD produces a significant increase
in interstitial brain water content, patients with a significant mass effect could be at risk for herniation, and thus
strict criteria are applied to exclude these patients from
BBBD.16 Unquestionably, this constitutes a huge bias
factor in detriment of the IA cohort.
Recently, Newton et al.14 reported on the importance of performing a 4-vessel angiogram before selecting the appropriate vessel(s) for treatment. In a series of
78 patients (39 with metastasis), those authors showed a
6.4% alteration in treatment plan after having performed a 4-vessel angiogram, and not just a diagnostic
angiogram of the presumed vessel(s) of interest, as we
do. The fact that the relevant vessel might not be
selected is worrisome, even if the risk is fairly low
(6.4%). As this instance can be easily avoided by a 4vessel angiography before the final planning of the treatment, this appropriate measure should be implanted in
every study on IA with or without BBBD. We intend to
do so in future trials.

Overall Survival
The analysis of a heterogeneous group of patients as a
whole, such as our series of brain metastasis, is always
difficult and data can be influenced by many confounding factors. One way to limit these confounding factors
is to stratify the patients according to validated prognos-

758

CANCER

tic factors. The recursive-partitioning analysis (RPA) of
the RTOG databases allows this stratification along 3 different prognostic classes.4 According to these classes,
median survival of patients with brain metastases
ranges between 2 and 7.1 months (Table 7). As most of
our patients (35 of 38, or 92.1%) fitted criteria of class 2
or 3, expected median survival for this group of patients
would lean between 2.3 and 4.2 months. Thus, a mean
and median survival of 19.9 and 13.5 months, respectively, compares favorably with this projection. It also
allows us to preclude favorable survival biases as an explanation for these results.

Lung Metastasis
Lung is the primary source of metastasis to the brain.
SCLCs and adenocarcinomas have similar frequencies
of seeding to the brain, averaging a 30% incidence.24
Overall, more than 50% of patients with brain metastases from lung cancer present with multiple lesions.25
A median survival of 4–8 months was reported for
adenocarcinoma patients treated with either systemic
chemotherapy regimens with and without prior
WBRT.24 The 9 patients with adenocarcinoma enrolled
in the present study presented 13.5 months of median
survival from study entry. All these patients were treated
at recurrence, after having failed radiation therapy.
Only 1 patient is still alive at 20.7 months.
The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Lung Cancer Cooperative
Group evaluated the efficacy of WBRT as the sole treatment for the SCLC subgroup and found a median disease-free survival of only 5.4 months, even though the
reported stabilization or improvement in neurological
status was 60%.25 Systemic chemotherapeutic regimens
have been used without prior WBRT with a median survivals ranging from 3 to 4 months.26 Some prospective
trials for the treatment of SCLC brain metastases have
found median survival of 3–6 months when these regimens were used after WBRT.24 In our series, a median
survival of 8.8 months was obtained for this group,
which demonstrates a limited advantage with respect to
results obtained from the literature. Only 3 patients
were treated with radiotherapy after having failed chemotherapy. From chemotherapy failure, these patients
showed a median survival of 2.7 months.
Ovarian Metastasis
Brain represents a rare site of metastasis for patients suffering from an ovarian carcinoma. Autopsy series
reported an incidence of CNS metastasis of 2% to 12%.
This site thus represents only 0.7% to 1.8% in a large series of patients with brain metastasis.27–29 Melichar
et al.28 found that a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and conventional chemotherapy was associated

with a median survival of 20 months and that surgery
with chemotherapy resulted in a median survival of 15
months. However, because of the small cohort size (2–12
patients), extrapolation of these intervals is limited.30
Our results are also marred by a small sample size of
5 patients, thus limiting the reach of our analysis. A median and mean survivals of 42.3 and 33.6 months,
respectively, from study entry were obtained in these
patients. More important, 2 of these 5 patients are still
alive and in CR after having completed the entire course
of treatment. All of the responders (n ¼ 4) were exposed
to chemotherapy alone, and thus were spared the side
effects and discomfort related to radiation therapy. Even
with a limited number of patients, we suggest that this
treatment modality is an adequate substitute to radiation therapy in this particular histology, and should thus
be considered up front.

Breast Metastasis
Ten to 15% of patients with advanced breast cancer will
eventually present with CNS involvement. CNS metastases would be a major contributing factor in the death of
68% of these patients.31 Patients are typically in an
advanced stage of their disease and have already been
exposed to multiple chemotherapy regimens.32 The
same can be said of our patients, who had all been
exposed to radiation therapy and to multiple chemotherapy regimens (average of 4).
Fenner and Possinger33 reviewed 8 trials on standard chemotherapy as treatment for brain metastasis of
breast cancer. They concluded that median survival was
6 months and that this figure was similar to WBRT. Different investigators have tested temozolomide in pretreated and preirradiated patients and have obtained a
median survival time of 4 to 7 months.5,34 Similar results
were produced in our series of 4 patients, with a median
survival of 8.1 months. The best response obtained was
2 SD. One factor that could explain the poor results
obtained in this group is the fact that all patients were
heavily pretreated for their systemic disease before
enrollment in our study. These results are in sharp contrast to the results published by Newton et al.,13 who
reported a CR/PR in 4 of 9 patients with breast cancer.
Thus, a larger and more diverse cohort will be needed to
study the impact of this treatment in this class of
patient.
Systemic Lymphoma With Brain Metastases
Parenchymal brain metastases from systemic lymphoma have been reported infrequently. In a series of
498 patients with malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma,
only 30 presented a secondary CNS involvement. The
prognosis of this condition is typically poor, with a
mean survival with treatment of 3.5 months.35 The

BBBD in Cerebral Metastases/Fortin et al.

patients in our series presented a median survival of
16.3 months, with 2 patients still in CR at 57.2 and 51.9
months. These results represent a significant improvement over previously published series, and this approach should be considered in this rare occurrence.

Complications
Doolittle et al.21 reported on the safety of this procedure,
when performed in a standardized fashion, in a multicenter setup. Our data further support this contention.
Poor Response Factors
When reviewing the pretreatment radiological characteristics of each patient, we found 2 surrogates adversely
impacting response: heavy tumor burden independent
of the histological nature of the brain metastasis, and important bihemispheric edema. The nature of the edema
may be vasogenic or postradiotherapy. All patients showing these features either alone or in combination
achieved a poor or no response at all.
Conclusion
Even if the number of patients in each subgroup is
small, the results obtained in this study seem promising
for the following histologies: ovarian carcinoma, lung
adenocarcinoma, SCLC, and lymphoma.
