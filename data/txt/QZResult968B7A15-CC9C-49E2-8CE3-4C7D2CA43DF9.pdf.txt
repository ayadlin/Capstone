ABSTRACT
Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC) remarkably decreases the quality of life
of EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients. In contrast to the lesions outside the central
nervous system (CNS), molecular mechanisms of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(TKI) resistance in CNS lesions including LMC are largely unknown. In this study, we
established an in vivo imaging model for LMC with EGFR mutant lung cancer cell lines
harboring an exon 19 deletion in EGFR and evaluated the effect of first generation
EGFR-TKIs, erlotinib, second generation afatinib, and third generation AZD9291. In
PC-9/ffluc model, erlotinib treatment slowed the development of LMC. Importantly,
treatment with afatinib or AZD9291 apparently delayed the development of LMC.
Moreover, treatment with a higher dose of AZD9291, also associated with inhibited
phosphorylation of EGFR downstream molecule S6, regressed LMC refractory to the
aforementioned EGFR-TKI treatments. These observations suggest that the third
generation EGFR-TKI AZD9291 may be an effective treatment for first or second
generation EGFR-TKI resistant LMC caused by EGFR-mutant lung cancer.

INTRODUCTION

after varying periods of treatment, and approximately onethird of patients develop CNS metastases after acquisition
of EGFR-TKI resistance [7–9]. Brain metastases are
manageable by concomitant use of EGFR-TKI and
radiation therapy including whole brain irradiation and
stereotactic radiotherapy [10]. There is, however, no
established therapy for LMC, which is resistant to first
and second generation EGFR-TKIs. Therefore, novel and
effective therapies need to be developed for managing
LMC in cancer patients.
Third generation EGFR-TKIs such as AZD9291
and CO-1686 effectively block EGFRs with the T790M
mutation as well as exon 19 deletion and L858R-sensitive
mutations, but do not inhibit wild type EGFRs. They have
also shown clinical efficacy in EGFR-mutant lung cancer
patients who previously treated with EGFR-TKIs [11, 12].
However, the efficacy of third generation EGFR-TKIs on
CNS metastasis is not well reported in literature.

Central nervous system (CNS) metastasis including
brain metastasis and leptomeningeal carcinomatosis
(LMC) often develops in several types of cancers such as
lung, breast, and renal cancer. It is a grave complication
that shortens survival and markedly diminishes the
quality of life of the patients [1]. The epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant-lung cancer represents
10% and 25% of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC)
in Caucasians and East Asians, respectively [2]. LMC
develops in patients that have the EGFR mutation more
often compared with patients without the mutation [3].
EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) such as
first generation gefitinib/erlotinib and second generation
afatinib showed remarkable activity in EGFR-mutant lung
cancer patients with or without CNS metastasis [4, 5, 6].
However, EGFR-TKI resistance may eventually develop

In the present study, we established an in vivo
imaging model for LMC with an EGFR-TKI sensitive
EGFR-mutant lung cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we
evaluated the efficacy of AZD9291 in comparison with
erlotinib and afatinib in our LMC model.

(Figure 3B, 3C). In parallel experiments, HCC827/luc and
H1975/luc cells developed LMC, and AZD9291 showed
efficacy against the LMC produced by HCC827/luc and
H1975/luc cells (Figure 4). These observations clearly
indicate that in addition to erlotinib, AZD9291 has activity
against LMC of EGFR-mutant lung cancer.

RESULTS

Effect of high dose of AZD9291 on LMC after
acquiring EGFR-TKI resistance

Establishment of an in vivo imaging model for
LMC of EGFR-mutant lung cancer

We next sought to examine whether a higher dose
of AZD9291 showed activity against an erlotinib-resistant
LMC model. When the mice with progressed LMC by
PC-9/ffluc cells after continuous treatment with 25 mg/
kg of erlotinib were treated with a high dose of AZD9291
(25 mg/kg), the LMC was regressed (Figure  5A). The
high dose-AZD9291 treatment also regressed LMC
that had progressed after treatment with 6 mg/kg of
AZD9291 (Figure 5A). Interestingly, phosphorylated S6
in leptomeningeal cancer cells was suppressed after a high
dose of AZD9291, as determined by immunofluorescence
analysis (Figure 5B). This confirmed the efficacy of
high dose-AZD9291 treatment against LMC. In parallel
experiments, we obtained similar results with LMC
models treated with afatinib. Briefly, 5 mg/kg of afatinib,
which could prevent the enlargement of subcutaneous
PC-9/ffluc tumors (Figure 6A), slowed the progression of
LMC. However, after continuous treatment with afatinib,
LMC in the treated mice progressed. It should be noted
that the high dose of ADZ9291 (25 mg/kg) could regress
LMC refractory to afatinib treatment (Figure 6B).

To establish an LMC model with an EGFRmutant lung cancer, we utilized the human EGFR
mutant lung adenocarcinoma PC-9/ffluc (exon 19
deletion) [13], HCC827/luc, and H1975/luc cells, which
were transfected with the fusion gene of luciferase for
in vivo imaging. EGFR-TKIs such as gefitinib, erlotinib,
afatinib, and AZD9291 decreased viability of PC-9/
ffluc and HCC827/luc cells (Figure 1A, Supplementary
Figure 4). On the other hand, only afatinib and AZD9291
decreased viability of H1975/luc cells (Supplementary
Figure 1). There was no discernible difference between
luciferase-gene transfectants and parental cells, in terms of
sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs. Western blot analysis of PC-9/
ffluc revealed that AZD9291 inhibited phosphorylation
of EGFR and its downstream molecule S6 in a dosedependent manner (Figure 1B). We inoculated PC-9/
ffluc cells into the leptomeningeal space of SHO-SCID
mice (Figure 2A). PC-9/ffluc cells (more than 1.6 × 103)
developed LMC in SHO-SCID mice. The survival of
the recipient mice was shortened in a cell numberdependent manner (Figure 2B). All mice inoculated with
2 × 105 PC-9/ffluc cells developed LMC (Figure 2C, 2D)
and became moribund within 28 days; we used this
experimental protocol for the following experiments.

Toxicity profiles of EGFR-TKIs in vivo
To evaluate the toxicity of EGFR-TKI treatment, we
measured the body weights of the mice during treatment.
Treatment with EGFR-TKIs including administration
of a high dose of AZD9291 did not caused severe body
weight loss (Supplementary Figures 2, 3, 4). Furthermore,
we assessed skin damage because AZD9291 has been
reported to have less activity against wild type EGFR
compared with mutant EGFRs such as exon 19 deletion,
and L858R and T790M [15]. Accordingly, expression
of phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase
(pMAPK), a downstream molecule of EGFR in normal
skin, remained present after continuous treatment with
6 mg/kg of AZD9291, while it was inhibited by the
continuous treatment with 25 mg/kg of erlotinib or
5 mg/kg of afatinib (Figure 7). Moreover, inhibition of
EGFR phosphorylation due to treatment with erlotinib or
afatinib could be reversed after continuous treatment with
25 mg/kg of AZD9291. These results strongly suggest that
AZD9291 at the dose without wild-type EGFR inhibition
is tolerable and sufficient for controlling LMC refractory
to first and second generation EGFR-TKIs.

Effect of EGFR-TKIs in the LMC model
We sought to examine the effect of AZD9291 in our
LMC model, as compared with erlotinib. In preliminary
experiments with the subcutaneous tumor model, daily
oral treatment with 25 mg/kg of erlotinib remarkably
prevented the enlargement of PC-9/ffluc tumors for more
than 23 days. In the same subcutaneous model, daily oral
treatment with 6 mg/kg of AZD9291 also prevented the
enlargement of PC-9/ffluc tumors (Figure 3A). Therefore,
we determined that 25 mg/kg of erlotinib and 6 mg/kg of
AZD9291 have equivalent activity in our mouse model.
In the LMC model with PC-9/ffluc cells, the mice
in the control group became moribund within 28 days
after tumor cell inoculation. Daily erlotinib treatment
(25 mg/kg) remarkably delayed the progression of LMC,
indicating that this dose of erlotinib was effective against
LMC, which is consistent with its reported clinical activity
[15]. Importantly, daily oral treatment with 6 mg/kg
of AZD9291 further delayed the progression of LMC

DISCUSSION

against LMC was unknown. Here, we clearly showed that
AZD9291 has potential against EGFR-TKI naïve LMC of
EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells. In addition, AZD9291 may
also have activity against LMC which is resistant to first and
second generation EGFR-TKIs. Based on our preclinical
evidence, we posit that clinical trials are required to
evaluate the efficacy of AZD9291 treatment in EGFRmutant lung cancer patients with CNS metastasis including
LMC with or without resistance to other EGFR-TKIs.
The ineffectiveness of EGFR-TKIs on CNS metastasis
is thought to be due to insufficient penetration of EGFRTKIs [5]. This is corroborated by the evidence that shows
erlotinib, which has better penetration in CNS lesions

In the present study, we have established an in vivo
imaging LMC model of EGFR-mutant lung cancer and
demonstrated that third generation EGFR-TKI, AZD9291,
can manage LMC in our model.
A recent study reported promising results with
AZD9291 treatment (response rate of 51%, and progression
free survival of 8.2 months) in patients who had
experienced radiographic progression after administration
of at least one EGFR-TKI [11]. However, since the effect
of AZD9291 specifically on CNS lesions including LMCs
was not reported in the study, the activity of AZD9291

than gefitinib, more effectively treats CNS metastasis
resistant to gefitinib treatment [14, 16]. However,
gefitinib is generally effective against EGFR-TKI naïve
CNS metastasis in EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients,
even though only 1% of gefitinib penetrates into the
CNS lesions [4, 5, 16, 17]. These observations suggest
the involvement of other mechanisms that result in the
development of marginal resistance to a low concentration
of EGFR-TKIs in CNS lesions. Unfortunately, we could
not recover tumor cells from the LMC model. Thus, the
molecular mechanism by which PC-9/ffluc cells acquire
resistance to EGFR-TKI treatment remains unknown.
For LMC resistant to the daily standard EGFRTKI treatment, no effective therapy has been established.
Intermittent high dose EGFR-TKI and EGFR-TKI

pulse therapy was proposed previously [18]. However,
recent retrospective studies reported that there was
no significant difference between the effect of a daily
standard dose of erlotinib and high dose erlotinib pulse
therapy on the overall survival of patients [19, 20]. We
also examined the effect of gefitinib-pulse treatment in
our LMC model. However, gefitinib-pulse treatment was
not superior to daily gefitinib treatment in the control
(Supplementary Figure 5).
Afatinib is an irreversible EGFR-TKI that has
been approved in many countries including US, EU, and
Japan. The results of the compassionate-use program
of afatinib indicate that this drug is equally effective in
EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients with CNS metastasis
compared with the patients without CNS metastasis

[7]. We found that afatinib at a dose of 5 mg/kg, which
was almost equivalent to 25 mg/kg of erlotinib against
subcutaneous tumors with PC-9/ffluc cells, remarkably
delayed the progression of LMC in our model (Figure 5).
The clinical efficacy of afatinib on CNS metastasis could
be replicated in the LMC model, confirming clinical

relevance of this model. Therefore, our LMC model may
be useful for testing experimental and novel therapies for
LMC.
In conclusion, we have established an LMC model
for EGFR-mutant lung cancer and demonstrated the
potential of third generation EGFR-TKI AZD9291, on not

the membranes were incubated with Blocking One
(Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) for 1 hour at
room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4°C
with primary antibodies against β-Actin, phospho-S6
(240/244), S6, phospho-EGFR (Y1068;Cell Signaling
Technology, Beverly, MA), and human EGFR (R & D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Subsequently, the membranes
were washed thrice again, and incubated for 1 hour at room
temperature with species-specific horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive
bands were visualized with SuperSignal West
Dura Extended Duration Substrate, an enhanced
chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce Biotechnology,
Rockford, IL). Each experiment was performed at least
three times, independently.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell cultures and reagents
The EGFR-mutant human lung adenocarcinoma
cell line PC-9 with deletions in EGFR exon 19 (del
E746_A750) and HCC827, with deletions in EGFR
exon 19 were purchased from Immuno-Biological
Laboratories Co. (Gunma, Japan) and the American
Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), respectively.
H1975 cells, with the L858R/T790M double mutations
in EGFR, were kindly provided from Drs. Yoshitaka
Sekido (Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan)
and John D. Minna (University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center). H1975/luc (JCRB1486) and HCC827/
luc (JCRB1516) cells, which are luciferase transfected
by Dr. Takashi Murakami (Laboratory of Tumor Biology,
Takasaki University of Health and Welfare, Takasaki,
Gunma, Japan), were provided from JCRB cell Bank
(Osaka, Japan). PC-9 ffLuc-cp156 transfectant (PC-9/
ffluc) was established as previously described [13].
These cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
antibiotics. All cells were passaged for less than 3 months
before renewing frozen, early-passage stocks. Cells were
regularly screened for mycoplasma contamination using
MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kits (Lonza, Rockland,
ME). The cell lines were authenticated at the laboratory of
the National Institute of Biomedical Innovation (Osaka,
Japan) by short tandem repeat analysis in May 2015.
Gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, and AZD9291 were obtained
from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX).

Tumor cell inoculation in severe combined
immunodeficiency (SHO-PrkdcscidHrhr) mice
We used 6-week-old female SHO-PrkdcscidHrhr mice
(SHO-SCID mice: Charles River, Yokohama, Japan) for
the study. For the subcutaneous tumor model, cultured
tumor cells (PC-9/ffluc; 3 × 106 cells/0.1 ml) were
implanted subcutaneously into the flanks of each mouse.
For the leptomeningeal metastasis model, the scalp was
sterilized with 70% ethanol, and the cultured tumor cells
were injected into the leptomeningeal space (between the
external occipital protuberance and first cervical vertebra)
with a 27G needle.
The size of subcutaneous tumors and body weights
of the mice were measured twice per week, and tumor
volume was calculated in mm3 (width2 × length/2). After 8
days, the mice were either left untreated or treated orally
with gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, or AZD9291.
This study was carried out in strict accordance with
the recommendations of the Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals by the Ministry of Education,
Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology in Japan. The
protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of
Experimental Animals and the Advanced Science Research
Center, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan (approval
no. AP-153499). All surgeries were performed on mice
anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital, and efforts were
made to minimize the suffering of the animals.

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was measured by the MTT dye
reduction method. Tumor cells were plated at a density
of 2 × 103/100 μl per well in RPMI 1640 plus 10% FBS
in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 hours. EGFRTKIs were then added to each well, and incubation was
continued for another 72 hours. Cell growth was measured
with MTT solution (2 mg/mL; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), as
described [21].

Luciferase expression and radiographic analyses
with the IVIS imaging system
After inoculation, the quantity of tumors was tracked
in live mice by repeated noninvasive optical imaging of
tumor-specific luciferase activity using the IVIS Lumina
XR Imaging System (PerkinElmer, Alameda, CA).
Twenty minutes after an intraperitoneal injection of the
luciferase substrate luciferin (150 mg/kg), the mice were
photographed under bright-field illumination and images
were overlaid with luminescence data gathered over the

by 2% isofluorane. The intensity of the bioluminescence
signal was analyzed using Living Image 4.0 (PerkinElmer)
by serially quantifying peak photon flux at the selected
region of interest (ROI) covering the tumor. This was
corrected for total area of ROI and time lapse during which
the bioluminescence signals were picked by the CCD
camera and expressed as photo/s/cm2/sr.
