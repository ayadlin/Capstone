Cell-Cycle Regulator Cks1 Promotes Hepatocellular
Carcinoma by Supporting NF-kB–Dependent Expression
of Interleukin-8
Eun-Kyoung Lee1,2, Dae-Ghon Kim3, Jang-Seong Kim1, and Yeup Yoon1

Abstract
The cell-cycle regulator Cks1 has recently been implicated in Skp2-mediated ubiquitination of the tumor
suppressor protein p27. In this article, we report that Cks1 exerts a Skp2-independent regulation of NF-kB that
promotes interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression, which is critical to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) growth. Cks1 was
upregulated frequently in human HCC tissues and cell lines. Cks1 knockdown in HCC cells elevated p27 levels and
decreased tumorigenicity in a manner that was also associated with a strong downregulation of IL-8 expression.
IL-8 downregulation was not phenocopied by either RNAi-mediated knockdown of Skp2 or ectopic overexpression of p27. However, attenuation of IL-8 expression itself was sufﬁcient to blunt HCC growth. Mechanistic
investigations revealed that IL-8 was controlled at a transcriptional level by Cks1 targeting of the NF-kB regulator
IkBa, which led to NF-kB activation and IL-8 expression, through a p27-independent regulation of IkB kinase
complex components. Collectively, our ﬁndings support the hypothesis that Cks1 supports hepatocarcinogenesis
by NF-kB–mediated regulation of IL-8 expression, broadening the function of Cks1 in cancer beyond its role as a
Skp2 cofactor in p27 ubiquitination. Cancer Res; 71(21); 6827–35. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common
cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide (1). The major risk
factors for HCC include chronic hepatitis from hepatitis B or C
virus infection and exposure to carcinogens such as aﬂatoxin
B1 (2). Despite the clinical signiﬁcance of HCC, we only know
the elemental basics of the molecular, cellular, and environmental mechanisms that drive disease pathogenesis, and only
limited therapeutic options are available, of which many have
negligible clinical beneﬁts (3). Therefore, elucidation of the
predominant molecular events underlying hepatocarcinogenesis may help identify new therapeutic targets.
Cks proteins were originally identiﬁed as subunits that
interact closely with cyclin–cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)
complexes (4, 5). Recently, mammalian Cks1 (CDC28 protein
kinase regulatory subunit 1B), located on chromosome 1q21.2,

was identiﬁed as an essential cofactor of Skp2 in the Skp2containing Skp1-Cullin1-F-box ubiquitin ligase complex
(SCFSkp2)–mediated ubiquitination of the tumor suppressor
protein p27 that leads to the proteasomal degradation of p27
(6–8). The CDK inhibitor p27 is a hallmark of many cancers,
and its reduced levels are associated with high aggressiveness
and poor prognosis in various malignant tumors (9). Similarly,
upregulation of Skp2 and/or Cks1 is signiﬁcantly associated
with poor prognosis in some cancers and, often, inversely
related to p27 protein levels (10–15). Among these malignancies, HCC showed a frequent and large gain of 1q, and 1q21-22
was identiﬁed as the minimum overlapping ampliﬁed region
containing candidate oncogenes for hepatocarcinogenesis
(16). Moreover, some microarray studies that characterized
the global gene expression in human HCC tissues and HCCderived cell lines showed that Cks1 was upregulated in HCC
(17, 18). Together, these ﬁndings indicate a signiﬁcant role of
Cks1 in hepatocarcinogenesis.
Interleukin-8 (IL-8), a proinﬂammatory CXC chemokine,
plays important roles in angiogenesis, mitosis, tissue remodeling, and tumor progression (19). IL-8 secreted from cancer cells
plays either autocrine or paracrine roles in the tumor microenvironment of various malignancies, including prostate,
colon, and pancreatic cancers (20). Especially in HCC, IL-8
derived from cancer cells was signiﬁcantly implicated in invasion and metastasis, rather than in tumor angiogenesis (21), and
the preoperative serum IL-8 level was suggested as a biomarker
of tumor invasiveness and progression (22). However, the
relationship between Cks1 and IL-8 has not yet been reported.
In this study, we assessed Cks1 expression in HCC tissues
and investigated the role of Cks1 in hepatocarcinogenesis,

sion was quantiﬁed by autoradiography. 18S rRNA served as a
normalization control; the primers for probe preparation were
as follows: (sense) 50 -GTAACCCGTTGAACCCCATT-30 and
(antisense) 50 -CCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCG-30 .

Materials and Methods

Microarray study
Total RNA (10 mg), prepared using an RNeasy Mini kit and
RNase-free DNase I (Qiagen), was hybridized to the CodeLink
human whole genome bioarray (55K; GE Healthcare). We
analyzed signiﬁcant changes in gene expression by Hierarchical Clustering using Signiﬁcance Analysis of Microarrays
(SAM) software.

Tissue samples
Fifteen pairs of HCC tissues and the corresponding nonneoplastic liver tissues were obtained from patients who
underwent surgical resection at the Chonbuk National University Hospital, Jeonju, Korea (Supplementary Table S1), and
the Hospital Research Ethics Committee approved the study.
Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.
Surgically removed tissues were sampled for histologic diagnosis and the remaining tissues were immediately cut into
small pieces, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored until
use. All protocols conformed to the ethical guidelines of the
Institutional Review Board.
Cell lines and culture conditions
The human HCC cell lines Huh7, SNU387, and SNU475, in
addition to human foreskin ﬁbroblasts, were purchased
from the Korea Cell Line Bank (Seoul, Korea). The human
HCC cell lines HepG2, Hep3B, and SK-Hep1 as well as the
human ﬁbrosarcoma cell line HT1080 were purchased from
the American Type Culture Collection. The cell lines were
maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium
(DMEM) supplemented with FBS and antibiotics (Invitrogen) in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 C. Human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were obtained
from Lonza and maintained in EGM2 (Lonza). The 293FT
was purchased from Invitrogen and maintained according
to the manufacturer's instructions. The cell lines have been
characterized at the bank by DNA ﬁngerprinting analysis
using short tandem repeat (STR) markers. All cell lines
were placed under cryostage after they were purchased
from the bank and used within 6 months of thawing fresh
vials.
Northern blot
Total RNA was isolated from cells or tissues using TRIzol
Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of total RNA (10 mg/lane for tissues and
20 mg/lane for cells) were resolved on 1% denaturing formaldehyde–agarose gels and transferred to a Hybond-N membrane (GE Healthcare). The IL-8 probe was prepared from
Huh7 total RNA by reverse transcription PCR using the following primers: (sense) 50 -ATGACTTCCAAGCTGGCCG-30 and
(antisense) 50 -TTATGAATTCTCAGCCCTC-30 . Probes for Cks1
and p27 were prepared with the primers used for constructing
pLenti-C and pLenti-p27, respectively. Probes were labeled
using the Prime-It II Random Primer Labeling Kit (Agilent
Technologies) and hybridized in ExpressHyb hybridization
solution (Clontech) at 60 C for 4 hours. Filters were washed
with 2 SSC–0.05% SDS at room temperature for 30 minutes
and with 0.1 SSC–0.1% SDS at 50 C for 30 minutes (1 SSC:
0.15 mol/L NaCl, 0.015 mol/L sodium citrate). mRNA expres-

Reverse transcription PCR
Reverse transcription was conducted with total RNA
(2 mg), according to the manufacturer's instructions (SuperScript III Reverse transcriptase; Invitrogen), and the reaction
mixture was used for the following PCR (ExTaq polymerase;
TakaRa).
Western blot analysis and ELISA
To obtain secreted IL-8 protein, 80% conﬂuent cultures
of cells were washed with PBS 3 times and incubated in
DMEM for 72 hours in 100-mm culture dishes. Conditioned
media were harvested and concentrated using Vivaspin 6 (5
kDa molecular weight cut-off; Sartorius-Stedim Biotech).
For cellular proteins, cells were washed with PBS 3 times
and lysed with lysis buffer (M-PER; Thermo Scientiﬁc)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentration was measured with a Bio-Rad Protein Assay.
Approximately 20 to 30 mg of protein was separated using
SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes
(Bio-Rad Laboratories). Western blot analysis was carried
out using ECL reagents (GE Healthcare). Glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served as a loading
control. In addition, IL-8 was quantiﬁed by ELISA. A total
of 3  105 cells were plated in each well of a 6-well plate in
DMEM containing 10% FBS. After 8-hour incubation at 37 C,
cells were washed with PBS 3 times and subsequently
incubated in DMEM containing 0.1% FBS for 18 hours. After
pretreatment with BAY 11-7082 (a speciﬁc inhibitor of IkBa
phosphorylation) or dimethyl suﬂoxide (vehicle) for 30 minutes, cells were further incubated in 10% FBS for 5 hours, and
the amount of IL-8 secreted into the media was analyzed
with an OptEIA human IL-8 ELISA kit (BD Biosciences)
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Cell proliferation assay
Cultured cells were incubated in DMEM containing 0.1%
FBS in 6-well plates (2  104 cells per well, in triplicate) for
18 hours at 37 C in 5% CO2, and subsequently cultured for
the indicated times in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The
number of viable cells was counted using trypan blue
exclusion assay.
In vitro invasion assay
Cultured cells were incubated for 18 hours in DMEM containing 0.1% FBS. On the day of the assay, we coated the top of

Skp2-Independent Control of IL-8 by Cks1 in Liver Cancer

Transwell polycarbonate membrane inserts (6.5-mm diameter
and 8-mm pores; Corning) with Matrigel (40 mg/well; BD
Biosciences). After adding DMEM containing 10% FBS into
the lower wells, single-cell suspensions in DMEM containing
0.1% FBS were placed on the membrane ﬁlters (1  105 cells/
100 mL/well) and incubated for 23 hours at 37 C in 5% CO2.
Filters were washed, and the cells on the upper surface were
manually removed with cotton swabs. Cells that had invaded
and adhered to the lower surface were ﬁxed with methanol for
15 minutes and stained with 0.1% (w/v) crystal violet for 15
minutes. The ﬁlters were extracted with 30% acetic acid. The
cells that had invaded were indirectly quantiﬁed by determining the absorbance at 595 nm.
In vitro colony-forming assay
The cell suspension (2  104 cells in 2 mL of DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.3% agar) was plated onto
60-mm dishes containing 5 mL of DMEM with 10% FBS and
0.5% agar. The dishes were incubated at 37 C in 5% CO2 for 21
or 28 days. Colonies were observed under a phase-contrast
microscope.
Promoter activity assay
A total of 1  106 Huh7 cells were plated in a 6-well plate
on the day of transfection and were incubated for 8 hours.
Cells were subsequently cotransfected with 1 mg of a luciferase reporter vector [pNF-kB-Luc (Stratagene), pAP1-Luc
(Stratagene), or pIL8-Luc] and 1 mg of RSV-LacZ (a kind gift
from Jae-B. Kim, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea),
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfected cells
were incubated in fresh medium. After 24 hours, both
luciferase and b-galactosidase assays were conducted
according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega).
The b-galactosidase assay was conducted to normalize
transfection efﬁciencies. pIL8-Luc was constructed by
inserting the minimal IL-8 promoter (350 bp) into the
pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). The IL-8 promoter region was
obtained by PCR using Huh7 genomic DNA prepared by a
Wizard SV Genomic DNA Puriﬁcation System (Promega)
and the following primers: (sense) 50 -GATGCTAGCGATAATTCACCAAATTGTGGAG-30 and (antisense) 50 -GATCTCGAGGTTTACACACAGTGAGATGGT-30 .
Implantation of tumors
Male 5-week-old athymic BALB/c nu/nu nude mice
(Charles River Laboratories Japan Inc.) were used for xenograft studies. All mice were fed a commercial diet, given
water ad libitum, and subjected to a 12-hour light/12-hour
dark cycle. Mice (n ¼ 5/group) were s.c. injected with 5  106
cells in the proximal midline of the dorsa. We measured
tumor sizes every 2 to 3 days and estimated tumor volumes
as width2  length  0.52.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as the mean  SD or SEM. Statistical
signiﬁcance was calculated using the Student t test. Values of
P < 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Cks1 is overexpressed in human HCC
Cks1 overexpression occurs in various cancers, including
oral squamous cell, lung, and gastric carcinomas. To investigate the potential role of Cks1 in hepatocarcinogenesis, we
determined the level of Cks1 in HCC tissues and cell lines by
Northern blot analysis. Cks1 expression was substantially
higher in HCC tissues than in the corresponding nontumor
liver tissues in 13 of the 15 pairs examined (Fig. 1A; 5 representative cases; Supplementary Fig. S1 for all cases). Furthermore, Cks1 was overexpressed in human HCC cell lines,
including Huh7, HepG2, Hep3B, SK-Hep1, SNU387, and
SNU475, relative to the levels in human normal liver tissue
and nontumorigenic HUVECs and ﬁbroblasts (Fig. 1B). These
results indicate that Cks1 overexpression may be associated
with hepatocarcinogenesis.
Cks1 correlates with in vitro proliferation rates
of HCC cells
To investigate the role of Cks1 in the regulation of cellular
proliferation of HCC cells, we conducted ectopic overexpression and knockdown of Cks1 in Huh7 cells using lentiviral
expression systems. Northern blot analysis conﬁrmed the
stable overexpression or knockdown of Cks1 in Huh7 cells.
As shown in Fig. 2A (top), the ectopically overexpressed Cks1
mRNA transcript (V: the 6 histidine-tagged form in the Cterminus) was clearly discernible from the endogenous form.
In vitro proliferation assays revealed that Cks1 overexpression
signiﬁcantly enhanced cellular proliferation (Fig. 2A, bottom).
In Cks1 knockdown, both short hairpin RNAs (shRNA; shC-#1
and shC-#2) efﬁciently suppressed Cks1 mRNA expression
compared with control cells (Fig. 2B, top), and the resulting
Cks1-knockdown Huh7 cells showed signiﬁcantly lower proliferation ability than control cells (Fig. 2B, bottom). Cks1 was
also positively correlated with cellular proliferation of SK-Hep1
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). These results imply that Cks1
plays an important role in HCC cell proliferation.

Cks1 knockdown increases p27 expression and
decreases HCC cell tumorigenicity
Because Cks1 is known as a cofactor of Skp2 in the SCFSkp2mediated ubiquitination of p27, we examined the effect of Cks1
knockdown on p27 level in Huh7 cells by Western blot analysis.
Cks1 knockdown increased p27 levels, indicating a role of Cks1
in the regulation of p27 degradation (Fig. 3A). Although CDK1,
2, and 4 were unaffected by Cks1 knockdown, cyclin E was
slightly increased, probably because of the decrease in its
SCFSkp2-mediated ubiquitination leading to proteasomal degradation (23). Cks1 knockdown also increased active caspase 3,
suggesting that this knockdown may induce cellular apoptosis.
To investigate the mechanism of p27 increase by Cks1 knockdown, we treated cells with 10 mmol/L MG132 (a speciﬁc
proteasome inhibitor) for 7 hours, which clearly abolished the
Cks1 knockdown–induced p27 increase in Huh7 cells (Fig. 3B).
This indicates that the Cks1 knockdown–induced p27 increase
was likely due to decreased proteasomal degradation.
Because p27 is an established tumor suppressor, we next
assessed the effects of Cks1 knockdown on Huh7 cell tumorigenicity. In a soft agar assay, Cks1-knockdown clones (shC7,
shC9, and shC11) showed substantially impaired colony-forming abilities as compared with control cells (Fig. 4A), indicating
that Cks1 contributes to the anchorage-independent growth of
Huh7 cells. Furthermore, SK-Hep1 cells exhibited a positive
correlation between Cks1 and in vitro colony-forming activity
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Cks1 knockdown signiﬁcantly
decreased the in vitro invasion ability of Huh7 cells stimulated
by 10% FBS (Fig. 4B). In mouse xenograft tumor experiments,
Cks1 knockdown substantially inhibited the growth of solid
tumors in vivo by more than 50% as compared with tumors
from mock cells (Fig. 4C; Supplementary Fig. S4 for results of
immunohistochemical analysis). Thus, Cks1 overexpression
may lead to hepatocarcinogenesis by directly enhancing the
cellular tumorigenic potential.

Western blot analyses (Fig. 5A). To investigate whether IL-8
downregulation resulted from the loss of Cks1 function as an
Skp2 cofactor, we prepared Skp2-knockdown and p27-overexpressing Huh7 cells, as conﬁrmed by Western blot analysis
(Fig. 5B and C, left). However, neither Skp2-knockdown nor
p27-overexpressing Huh7 cells showed IL-8 downregulation
(Fig. 5B and C, right). This may be partly attributable to the fact
that, unlike Cks1 knockdown, either p27 overexpression or
Skp2 knockdown was not accompanied by Cks1 decrease, as
assessed by Western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. S5). In
contrast to IL-8, osteopontin (OPN), another protein substantially downregulated by Cks1 knockdown in Huh7 cells,
showed p27-dependent expression in Huh7 cells, showing a
different regulation mechanism from that of IL-8 (Supplementary Fig. S6). These results indicate that Cks1 may regulate IL-8
expression in Huh7 cells through an unknown function other
than an Skp2 cofactor in p27 ubiquitination.

IL-8 contributes to the oncogenic activities of Cks1
To investigate the contribution of IL-8 to the Cks1 oncogenesis, we carried out in vitro tumorigenicity assays with IL-8–
knockdown Huh7 cells. Stable IL-8–knockdown Huh7 cells
were established and conﬁrmed by Western and Northern
blot analyses (Fig. 6A). Neither the empty vector (pLL3.7B) nor
the nonspeciﬁc shRNA-expressing vector (pLL3.7B ) affected
IL-8 expression (shM and shM , respectively), compared with
the expression in the parental Huh7 cells. This indicates that
the Cks1 knockdown–derived IL-8 reduction was not a nonspeciﬁc effect from the shRNA expression process itself in the
vector system. IL-8 knockdown signiﬁcantly inhibited both in
vitro proliferation and invasion abilities of Huh7 cells, compared with control cells (Fig. 6B). Further evaluation showed
that IL-8 also plays a critical role in the anchorage-independent
Huh7 cell growth (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that IL-8
signiﬁcantly contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis by mediating the oncogenic activities of Cks1.
Cks1 controls IL-8 expression through the unique
regulation of the NF-kB pathway
The promoter of the IL-8 gene contains several transcription
factor–binding sequences and, among these factors, NF-kB and
AP1 play central roles in regulating IL-8 gene expression (24).
To investigate the regulatory mechanism of IL-8 expression by
Cks1, we determined the effect of Cks1 knockdown on luciferase expression under the control of NF-kB enhancer, AP1
enhancer, or minimal IL-8 promoter including both enhancers
and found that Cks1 knockdown signiﬁcantly decreased IL-8
promoter activity in Huh7 cells, which seemed to be derived
mainly by the decreased activity of NF-kB, not AP1 (Fig. 7A;
Supplementary Fig. S7). To conﬁrm the involvement of the NFkB pathway in the regulation of IL-8 expression, we measured
IL-8 secretion in the presence or absence of BAY 11-7082 (an
inhibitor of IkBa phosphorylation). BAY 11-7082 substantially
decreased IL-8 expression in a dose-dependent manner, as
determined by ELISA (Fig. 7B). Moreover, Western blot analysis showed that Cks1 knockdown signiﬁcantly decreased
the kinase subunits, both IKKa and IKKb, and the regulatory subunit, IKKg, of the IKK complex, whereas p27

examined NF-kB p65 phosphorylation status important for
its transcriptional activity, but did not ﬁnd any differences
between control and Cks1-knockdown cells (Supplementary
Fig. S8). Next, we compared IkBa phosphorylation, the ratelimiting step in NF-kB activation, between control and Cks1knockdown cells, which showed that Cks1 knockdown significantly reduced IkBa phosphorylation compared with control
cells (Fig. 7D). Therefore, it can be hypothesized that the
proteasomal degradation of IkBa via IKK complex-mediated
phosphorylation was suppressed by Cks1 knockdown through
the downregulation of IKK complex, eventually leading to NFkB inhibition and, thereby, IL-8 downregulation. These results
revealed a novel function of Cks1 in the regulation of the NF-kB
pathway.

The heterogeneous phenotypic and genetic traits of individuals with HCC and the wide range of risk factors associated
with HCC have led to HCC being classiﬁed as a complex disease
(25). In this article, we present a novel tumor-promoting
function of Cks1 in hepatocarcinogenesis.
Cks1 reportedly correlates with proliferation of lymphoid,
oral squamous cancer, and prostate cancer cells (26–28).
Furthermore, Cks1 overexpression is noted in numerous cancers, including multiple myeloma, lung, gastric, and oral carcinomas (13, 27, 29, 30). Recently, Cks1, along with Skp2 and/or
p27, was hypothesized to be a potential prognostic marker for
some cancers (12, 27, 31, 32). In the present study, Cks1
expression was higher in human HCC tissues than in adjacent
nontumor liver tissues. In addition, Cks1 was correlated with
the in vitro HCC cell proliferation, and knocking down of Cks1

in Huh7 cells elicited an increase in the p27 protein. MG132
treatment of HCC cells revealed that Cks1 participates in the
proteasomal degradation of p27. Consistent with the fact that
p27 is a well-known tumor suppressor, Cks1 knockdown
signiﬁcantly inhibited the tumorigenic potential of Huh7 cells
both in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro inhibitory effect of Cks1
knockdown on the tumorigenicity of cancer cells was also
reported with prostate cancer (28). Recently, the Skp2–Cks1
complex was reported to be involved in the degradation of
several tumor suppressor proteins other than p27 (DUSP1,
RASSF1A, p130, etc.) in HCC cells (14, 33). Therefore, it may not
be excluded that suppressor proteins other than p27 may also
participate in the anti-HCC activities of Cks1 knockdown. Our
results indicate that Cks1 overexpression may contribute to
hepatocarcinogenesis by enhancing the cellular tumorigenic
potential, which may be partly imparted by participating in
ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation of p27 as a
cofactor of Skp2.
In addition to the CDK- or Skp2-dependent function, Cks1
may also function as a transcription activator for maintaining
efﬁcient transcriptional activation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(34–36). This ﬁnding prompted us to obtain genome-wide
insights on Cks1 function(s) in HCC cells. This analysis
revealed that Cks1 knockdown in Huh7 cells signiﬁcantly
changed the expression of genes known to participate in
various cellular processes, including gene transcription, cell
death, apoptosis, signal transduction, stress response, immune

response, cell cycle, and so on. Notably, genes related to
proliferation, angiogenesis, inﬂammation, invasion, and
metastasis were signiﬁcantly downregulated by Cks1 knockdown, implying that Cks1 may play signiﬁcant and diverse roles
in hepatocarcinogenesis. Among these genes, IL-8 was one of
the most downregulated genes in Huh7 cells, according to a
microarray study and Northern and Western blot analyses.
Autocrine or paracrine roles of IL-8 in tumor growth, invasion,
angiogenesis, and/or metastasis have been reported in various
tumor types, such as skin, stomach, prostate, hepatic, and
pancreatic cancers (37–40). In Ras-transformed cells, Rasdependent IL-8 secretion has been shown to contribute to
tumor growth by initiating tumor-associated inﬂammation and
neovascularization as a paracrine, and not an autocrine, factor
(41). In HCC patients, serum IL-8 levels signiﬁcantly correlated
with tumor size and tumor stage, and its preoperative levels
were hypothesized to be a useful biologica marker of tumor
invasiveness and progression (22). Akiba and colleagues
reported IL-8 expression in HCC tissues whose cancer cells
were the main source of IL-8, and hypothesized that IL-8 may
have an important function in cancer invasion and metastasis,
rather than in tumor angiogenesis (21). In the present study,
Cks1 knockdown–induced IL-8 downregulation in Huh7 cells
was not apparently associated with either Skp2 dysfunction or
p27 accumulation, thereby suggesting a novel function of Cks1
in hepatocarcinogenesis. Moreover, IL-8 knockdown signiﬁcantly suppressed the tumorigenicity of Huh7 cells, indicating that

IL-8 may be an important autocrine factor for HCC cells and a
key mediator of the Skp2- and p27-independent oncogenic
function of Cks1 in hepatocarcinogenesis.
IL-8 is transcriptionally regulated mainly by NF-kB and AP1
(24). In the present study, Cks1 regulated IL-8 expression in
Huh7 cells through NF-kB (not AP1)-mediated transcriptional
control, although AP1 is reportedly required for constitutive
IL-8 gene expression in hepatoma cells (42). IkB proteolysis, the
rate-limiting step in NF-kB activation, is regulated by the IKK
complex, which is composed of 2 catalytic subunits, IKKa and
IKKb, and 1 regulatory subunit, IKKg (43). Li and colleagues
reported that IKKb-deﬁcient mice die at mid-gestation from
uncontrolled liver apoptosis, a phenotype similar to that of
mice deﬁcient in both NF-kB p65 and NF-kB1 (p50/p105;
ref. 44). Constitutive activation of NF-kB is seen in several
cancers, including prostate cancer, ﬁbrolamellar HCC, and
glioblastoma (45–47). Arsura and colleagues reported that
constitutive activation of NF-kB in Ras-transformed rat liver
epithelial cells was dependent on IKKa and IKKb activation
(48). In addition, Factor and colleagues described an important
role of the IKK complex in the constitutive NF-kB activation,
which led to HCC development in double transforming growth
factor-a and c-myc transgenic mice (49). In the current study,
Cks1 controlled IKKa and IKKb expression independently of
p27, in contrast to the p27-dependent control of IKKg expression, in HCC cells. The p27-induced IKKg downregulation
failed to elicit IL-8 decrease, indicating that IKKa and IKKb,
rather than IKKg, may play an important role in the NF-kB–
mediated transcriptional regulation of IL-8 in HCC cells.
However, additional studies are necessary to further investi-

gate the mechanism of how Cks1 regulates the expression of
each IKK subunit and the implication of p27-mediated IKKg
regulation in Cks1 function.
In summary, we showed a signiﬁcant role of Cks1 in hepatocarcinogenesis and identiﬁed IL-8 as a key autocrine mediator of the oncogenic function of Cks1. Cks1 regulated IL-8
expression in an Skp2-independent mode, probably through
the speciﬁc control of IKKa and IKKb in the NF-kB pathway.
Collectively, our study uncovered a novel function of Cks1 in
the NF-kB pathway regulation, which may be different from the
Skp2 cofactor function in p27 ubiquitination. Thus, Cks1 may
be a promising therapeutic target in HCC management.
