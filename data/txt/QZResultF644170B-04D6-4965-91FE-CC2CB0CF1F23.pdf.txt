Abstract
The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy has become more
prevalent in the treatment of breast cancer patients. The
finding of a pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant
chemotherapy (no evidence of residual invasive cancer in the
breast and lymph nodes at the time of surgical resection) has
been shown to correlate with improved survival. The current
version of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)
staging for breast cancer has a pretreatment clinical stage
designation that is determined by clinical and radiographic
examination of the patient and a postoperative pathologic
stage classification based on the findings in the breast and
regional lymph nodes removed at surgery. Pathologic staging
has not been validated for patients receiving neoadjuvant
chemotherapy; thus, prognosis is determined for these
patients based on the pretreatment clinical stage. We
hypothesized that clinical and pathologic staging variables
could be combined with biological tumor markers to provide
a novel means of determining prognosis for patients treated
with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Two scoring systems, based
on summing binary indicators for clinical and pathologic
substages, negative estrogen receptor status, and grade 3
tumor pathology, were devised to predict 5-year patient
outcomes. These scoring systems facilitated separation of
the study population into more refined subgroups by outcome
than the current AJCC staging system for breast cancer, and
provide a novel means for evaluating prognosis after neoadjuvant therapy. [Cancer Res 2008;68(16):6477–81]

Background
Cancer staging systems provide both physicians and patients
with a mechanism for placing disease into a specific context to aid
in treatment planning and determining prognosis. Staging also
allows for an ease of communication among treating physicians
across multiple disciplines as patients undergo the multimodal
management of disease. The significance of staging for patients
tends to be an individual experience. Oncologists relay staging
information to their patients to prepare them for the appropriate
recommended treatments and to communicate directly about
outcomes. This allows patients to plan and manage their personal
and professional lives while undergoing what is often a complex
and long period of treatment. Recent work has shown the

importance of clear and open communication between oncologists
and cancer patients (1, 2). Mack and colleagues (1) have found that
although physicians may withhold prognostic information in an
attempt to maintain patient optimism, conversely, overt discussion
of outcomes, favorable or unfavorable, was more effective in
sustaining patient morale. Furthermore, patients with an accurate
understanding of prognosis can more appropriately process future
quality of life expectations. If such information is withheld, this
possibility may be lost (1). When oncologists respond to patient
concerns with statements that facilitate the further discussion of
these concerns, patients show decreased anxiety and depression
and improved satisfaction and compliance (2). These findings show
the significance of staging for patients with cancer. This is of
increased importance in the neoadjuvant setting where clinical and
pathologic response rates are known to provide additional
prognostic information for breast cancer patients treated with
chemotherapy before surgical intervention.
The implementation of staging as a routine part of patient
assessment has also had a great effect on the management of
cancer. There are now standard treatment guidelines published by
the National Comprehensive Cancer Network that are based on
individual stage designations. Traditionally, breast cancer has been
staged using the tumor-node-metastasis, or TNM, system, revised
most recently by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)
in 2003 (3). The TNM status is determined for each individual
patient and corresponds to a specific stage grouping, which is then
correlated to prognosis and a treatment plan. Breast cancer
patients receive a clinical stage at initial diagnosis, before any
surgical intervention, determined by physical examination, radiological studies, and biopsy findings. The definitive breast cancer
stage is based on pathologic information obtained at the time of
surgical removal of the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes. A
pathologist analyzes the tissue to precisely establish the tumor size
and extent of lymph node involvement. Tumors are graded as low
grade ( favorable), intermediate grade, or high grade (unfavorable),
to provide a microanatomic perspective on the disease, using tissue
and cellular phenotype as markers for cancer aggressiveness.
Multiple other variables can be determined from evaluation of
the primary tumor including evidence of invasion into blood
vessels or lymphatics, evidence of overexpression or amplification
of oncogenes, deletion of tumor suppressor genes, proliferation
status, and DNA ploidy. Biological markers that are routinely
assessed in breast cancer specimens in pathology laboratories
include estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptor expression,
and HER-2/neu status. These markers can be assessed by several
different techniques including immunohistochemical analysis and
florescence in situ hybridization. Although there are several
concerns regarding the lack of formal, standardized processing
protocols for many of the biological markers currently being used

routinely in the clinic, much of the literature on these markers is
consistent with the expected associated patient outcomes. The
anticipation is that as more biological markers are characterized in
terms of their prognostic or predictive abilities, they will be
incorporated into the standard pathologic assessment and, thus,
help facilitate a more refined molecular staging of disease.
Until recently, the majority of patients with breast cancer were
treated with surgery first followed by chemotherapy, hormonal
therapy, and radiation therapy as indicated by the pathologic
findings. With this treatment paradigm, patients would typically
receive a clinical stage shortly before obtaining a more definitive
pathologic stage. Neoadjuvant therapy, or chemotherapy treatment
preceding surgical removal of the tumor and lymph nodes, has
been the standard treatment plan for patients with more advanced
or inoperable breast cancers. Recently, the indications for neoadjuvant therapy have expanded to include patients with operable
and early stage disease (4, 5). This neoadjuvant approach is based
on the finding that most breast tumors will decrease in size by at
least 50% when exposed to 3 to 4 cycles of cytotoxic chemotherapy,
thus permitting breast conserving surgery over mastectomy.
Another potential benefit of neoadjuvant therapy is the ability to
assess primary tumor response to the individual treatment, with
the notion that agents could be adjusted depending on response
(6). Although current evidence from randomized neoadjuvant trials
does not support changing agents for patients with stable disease,
patients who show disease progression should be considered for
surgical treatment, radiation therapy, or management with a
different systemic agent (7–9).
The broader use of neoadjuvant therapy has created a more
complex scenario for breast cancer staging, as patients may present
with an advanced clinical stage, and could have a much more
favorable pathologic stage after the completion of neoadjuvant
treatment and surgery. It is unclear whether the initial clinical
stage or the final pathologic stage is more meaningful in terms of
prognosis and further treatment decisions. Additionally, there is no
current methodology for incorporating the information on clinical
and pathologic response to the chemotherapy into the stage
grouping. Because patients who experience a complete resolution
of invasive disease in the breast and axilla, termed as a pathologic
complete response (pCR), have more favorable outcomes, it would
be useful to combine this information with the initial clinical stage
(5, 6, 10–12). Up to this point, prognosis for patients treated with
neoadjuvant chemotherapy was shown to be determined best by
application of the 2003 AJCC breast cancer pathologic staging
system using final pathologic data obtained at the time of surgical
resection, and more recently by the assessment of pathologic
response through precise measurement of the residual burden of
disease (12, 13).
To help address the gap in knowledge regarding the effect of
pretreatment clinical stage and posttreatment pathologic stage on
overall prognosis, we have proposed new models for staging that
incorporate clinical and pathologic substages as well as data on
biological tumor markers (14). Using a database of prospectively
collected clinical and pathologic information from patients treated
at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, 932
patients who received neoadjuvant treatment were identified to
help create two novel staging models. The expectation was that by
combining clinical, pathologic, and biological markers, more
precise prognostic information would be revealed, which could
then better guide additional treatment decisions, particularly as
new therapeutic agents become available.

Results
We developed two systems to estimate the prognosis of patients
treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A Cox proportional
hazards model with backward stepwise exclusion of factors, using
a criterion of a P value of <0.05 for retention of factors in the
model, was used to create the Clinical-Pathologic Scoring System
(CPS) from all clinical and pathologic substages. Model performance was quantified using Harrell’s concordance index. After
defining the CPS system, a second Cox proportional hazards
model, with backward stepwise exclusion of factors and stratified
on CPS, was used to test the added significance of ER and PR
status, nuclear grade, HER-2/neu status, presence of lymphovascular space invasion, patient age at presentation, and chemotherapy cycle number (3 versus z4 cycles). The first model, the CPS
system, used clinical stage greater than or equal to stage IIB or IIIB
and pathologic stage greater than or equal to stage pIIA or pIIIC to
predict distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and diseasespecific survival (DSS). Further analysis revealed that ER-negative
disease and nuclear grade 3 tumor pathology were independent
risk factors for poor prognosis. These variables were then added to
the CPS system to create a second scoring system, the CPS-EG
system. Points were assigned according to each presenting clinical
substage, final (postneoadjuvant chemotherapy) pathologic substage, and the biological markers. By adding up the points, an
overall CPS or CPS-EG score was determined (Table 1).
Through the CPS scoring system, patients were stratified into
5 groups with scores of 0 to 4. Increasing CPS scores were
associated with decreasing 5-year DMFS and DSS. The addition of
ER status and nuclear grade in the CPS-EG score provided
additional predictive value, and allowed for further expansion of
the scoring system to 7 distinct 5-year DMFS and DSS subgroups.
For the study cohort, 5-year DSS for AJCC clinical stages ranged
from 67% to 98% and, for pathologic stages, ranged from 61% to
96%. Implementation of the CPS scoring system increased this 5year DSS range from 48% to 99%, which was further improved with
the CPS-EG scoring system, to a DSS range of 22% to 100%. Thus,
we improved upon the prognostic value of the AJCC clinical or
pathologic stage alone by combining clinical, pathologic, and
biological factors resulting in a unifying CPS-EG system for the
determination of patient outcomes. An example of this improved
prognostic stratification was shown by application of the CPS-EG
system to patients who were designated as pathologic AJCC stage
IIA (n = 251) in the study population, predicted to have a 5-year
DSS of 90% [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 85–93]. Through
application of the CPS-EG scoring system to this stage IIA
population, 5 prognostic groups were determined having the after
DSS outcomes: score 1, 100%; score 2, 98%; score 3, 86%; score 4,
85%; and score 5, 64% (Fig. 1).

Impact
The scoring systems proposed in this study move beyond the
traditional AJCC staging system to incorporate biological factors
that can further aide in determining the prognosis of patients
treated with neoadjuvant therapy. These biological factors are also
important predictors of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
These scoring systems represent a novel means for using both
pretreatment and posttreatment patient data to determine the
effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on patient outcomes. The
information obtained from the scoring systems has the capacity to
provide patients and physicians with more precise information

NOTE: Based on the need to better address the prognostic determination for patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy, two scoring systems were
devised. The CPS system includes both presenting clinical substage and posttreatment pathologic substage. The CPS-EG system uses the addition of
biological markers to further improve the discrimination of the CPS system. Point assignments for the CPS and CPS-EG scoring systems are found in the
worksheet above. Associated 5-y DMFS and DSS levels for patients based on scores from the CPS and CPS-EG system show how clinical, pathologic, and
biological variables can be easily collated to derive outcomes for patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy.

regarding prognosis. More refined prognostic information may help
facilitate improved decision making regarding postoperative
treatment strategies and, therefore, have the potential to affect
quality of life for patients with breast cancer. This risk-stratification
is important because there are currently no treatment guidelines
for determining the need for additional therapies in patients who
receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Previous efforts to examine the predictive value of tumor
response to neoadjuvant therapy focused primarily on the
relationship between achieving a pCR and a corresponding superior
overall survival. Whereas patients who experienced a pCR generally
had improved outcomes, patients with a partial response to
treatment can also have improved survival beyond what their
initial clinical stage would indicate (10). Through the implementation of the CPS-EG system, patients who experienced a pCR are
further risk stratified. Patients presenting with early stage disease
(stage I or IIA) without associated adverse biological markers were
found to have the most favorable prognosis. Overall, the more
advanced the presenting stage, the worse the projected outcomes
were despite attainment of a pCR. This was also true for patients
who had achieved less than a pCR upon final pathology review.
Outcomes for these patients were further negatively influenced if
the patients presented with adverse biological markers. Our data

therefore show that all patients who achieve a pCR are not
the same biologically and cannot be expected to have similar
outcomes. Additionally, our findings emphasize the weighted
significance of presenting clinical stage on DMFS and DSS, implying
that patient outcomes are largely determined by the primary
biology of disease, despite currently available therapeutic interventions. This finding may be explained, in part, by the persistence
of resistant cancer stem cells in those patients who present with
more advanced disease (15, 16). The presence of these resistant cells
may account for the greater likelihood of relapse and death in
patient subgroups who initially responded favorably to neoadjuvant
treatment.
Breast cancer cells with a high nuclear grade and low or negative
hormone receptor expression are typically associated with
more aggressive disease. The loss of normal cell-cell interactions,
high mitotic count, nuclear pleomorphism, and loss of normal
hormone receptor expression have also been associated with
cell cycle abnormalities, including overexpression of cyclins
and down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors
(17, 18). Thus, due to their more rapid cellular turn-over, highgrade, ER-negative breast cancers are more likely to respond
to chemotherapeutic treatment with a decrease in tumor size,
and are more likely to achieve a pCR (10, 19–23). Nevertheless,

Figure 1. DSS for pathologic stage IIA patients stratified by the CPS-EG scoring system. Through application of the CPS-EG scoring system to AJCC pathologic stage
IIA patients, 5 prognostic groups were determined having the following 5-y DSS outcomes: score 1, 100%; score 2, 98%; score 3, 86%; score 4, 85%; and score 5, 64%.

despite the attainment of a pCR, patients with ER-negative,
high-grade lesions have an overall poor prognosis (19). This
paradox, that the same biological markers involved in chemotherapeutic response are associated with poor outcomes, underscores
the significance of new marker discovery to improve both
prognostic determination and subsequent treatment strategies
and trial design.
Breast cancers are routinely evaluated by stage, which reflects
the macroanatomic nature of disease, and pathologic grade,
which reflects the microanatomic nature of cancer. The
significance of stage and grade lies in their contribution to the
determination of disease prognosis and treatment. Currently,
the accuracy of stage and grade is not refined, which results
in subsets of patients being undertreated and overtreated, either
of which may lead to unnecessary morbidity or untimely death.
New methods for evaluating breast cancer are necessary to bring
critical refinement to the management of this disease. The
addition of a molecular staging to the traditional stage and grade
designations may help to facilitate this refinement. To this end,
clinical trials are currently under way to examine the utility of
signature gene profile DNA microarrays as a novel means for
establishing breast cancer prognosis (24). The Oncotype DX assay,
which uses 21 genes to predict breast cancer recurrence in
patients with early stage breast cancer, is actively being
incorporated into clinical practice and clinical trials to aid in

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (16). August 15, 2008

prognosis determination and to evaluate the predictive ability of
the assay (25).
The data presented emphasize the significance of the initial
presenting clinical stage on patient outcomes. Thus, the detection
of breast cancer at its earlier stages through breast cancer
screening remains important, and cannot be overemphasized. The
scoring systems described in this work, for the staging of patients
treated with neoadjuvant therapy, show the effect that the
addition of biological markers can have on the further
clarification of patient outcomes. The potential for this more
refined prognostic information to alter treatment strategies is
currently being explored (26). Subsequent to the prospective
validation of this work, data should be forthcoming to determine
if changes in postneoadjuvant, postsurgical care will positively
influence patient outcomes. Nevertheless, there is currently
limited data available to determine if patient outcomes will be
improved through the use of additional postoperative treatments
in patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Studies are
being performed implementing molecular profiling to predict
response to neoadjuvant regimens (27, 28). This may also be
possible for patients who have residual disease after completion
of neoadjuvant therapy. To this end, a multicenter study has been
under way to examine the effects of bevacizumab alone or in
combination with other chemotherapies for patients with residual
disease after neoadjuvant treatment (29). The expectation that

new targeted therapies will soon be available, and that phase I
trials are ongoing, demands a mechanism for better determining
which patients would be best suited for further therapy (30, 31).
The proposed scoring systems attempt to provide information for
this purpose.
We anticipate that the prospective accrual of patients
undergoing neoadjuvant treatment will lead to validation of our
findings and add strength to the outcomes data presented.
Furthermore, we are optimistic that through the addition of new
molecular markers to the scoring system, improvements in patient
care will be facilitated. A Web site has been created which will allow
clinicians in any location to access and use the neoadjuvant scoring
