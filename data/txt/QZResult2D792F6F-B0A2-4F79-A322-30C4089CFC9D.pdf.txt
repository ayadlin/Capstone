Tumor-Associated Neutrophils: New Targets for
Cancer Therapy
Alyssa D. Gregory1 and A. McGarry Houghton1,2

Abstract
Studies have begun to emerge showing critical roles for neutrophils in tumorigenesis. Neutrophils can have
a significant impact on the tumor microenvironment via their production of cytokines and chemokines,
which influence inflammatory cell recruitment and activation. Additionally, products secreted from neutrophils, such as reactive oxygen species and proteinases, have defined and specific roles in regulating tumor
cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Although evidence suggests that neutrophils act in a
decidedly protumor capacity in vivo, recent studies indicate that neutrophils may be manipulated to exhibit
cytotoxicity against tumors. Herein, we explore the idea of targeting tumor-associated neutrophils as a means
of antitumor therapy and the important ramifications such manipulation could pose to host tissues. Cancer

Introduction
The tumor microenvironment is composed of numerous
immune and nonimmune cell types in addition to tumor cells
themselves. Controlled experiments have shown important
roles for many of these cells, including lymphocytes, natural
killer (NK) cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells,
and pericytes (1). Although commonly encountered within the
tumor microenvironment, neutrophils have not been traditionally considered anything more than a casual observer, and
certainly not a disease modifying entity. This view likely
reflects disbelief that such a short-lived cell could impact a
chronic, progressive disease. However, upregulation of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN)–chemotactic substances
ensures the constant replenishment of tumor-associated neutrophils (TAN), which are fully capable of modifying tumor
growth and invasiveness.
Neutrophils, or PMNs, exist to defend the host from invading microorganisms and to assist in wound healing (2).
Invading pathogens elicit an inflammatory response that
recruits neutrophils to sites of infection. Once there, neutrophils engulf and eliminate microorganisms using an arsenal of
cytotoxic substances (3). Activated neutrophils also release
proteinases into the extracellular environment, leading to
damage of surrounding host tissue (4). Additionally, neutro-

phils produce cytokines and chemokines, which can impact
inflammatory cell recruitment, altering the immune response
(2). This process of PMN recruitment and activation, observed
in infection, is recapitulated within the tumor microenvironment; however, accumulating evidence suggests that, in this
context, PMNs act to the detriment of the host.

Tumor-Associated Neutrophils Function against
the Host in Cancer
Neutrophils make up a significant portion of the inflammatory cell infiltrate found in a wide variety of murine models and
human cancers (5–8). Many cell types within the tumor microenvironment are capable of secreting neutrophil chemotactic
substances. However, it seems that, at least in some cases, the
tumor cells themselves mediate neutrophil recruitment to sites
of tumorigenesis by secreting CXC chemokines [e.g., interleukin-8 (IL-8)], strongly suggesting that TANs are not a means of
host defense. Sparmann and Bar-Sagi first showed that mutant
K-ras induced IL-8 expression via an NF-kB–dependent
mechanism (9). Our group subsequently showed that LoxStop-Lox (LSL)–K-ras mouse adenomas recruit TAN by releasing KC and MIP-2 (10), murine equivalents of IL-8. Accordingly,
simple neutrophil depletion experiments using Gr-1 antibodies
have been shown to inhibit tumor growth (11), limit metastasis
number (12), and reduce endothelial cell recruitment to tumors
(9). Other investigators have sought to inhibit neutrophil
accumulation at the tumor site by blocking the IL-8 receptors,
CXCR-1 and -2 (13). Although this approach successfully
reduced tumor burden, the mechanism by which this was
accomplished has been difficult to decipher. CXCR-1 and -2
are located on tumor cells (autocrine growth), endothelial cells
(angiogenesis), and neutrophils (recruitment), therefore, the
relative contribution of PMN to IL-8–mediated tumor growth
will require more sophisticated studies to specifically delete
CXCR-2 on neutrophils.

Clinical studies have indicated that the presence of neutrophils confers a poor prognosis. For example, a quantification of TANs in patients with renal cell carcinoma revealed
that the presence of neutrophils correlated with increased
mortality (6). In addition, increased levels of PMNs in the
bronchioalveolar space of patients with bronchioalveolar carcinoma were significantly associated with poor outcomes (7).
Notably, IL-8 levels have been associated with PMN accumulation and reduced survival (8), which have important therapeutic implications, discussed herein.

Mechanisms of Polymorphonuclear Leukocyte–
Mediated Tumor Progression
Neutrophils have a limited number of agents with which to
modify tumor growth and invasiveness. These agents include
chemokines and/or cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS),
and matrix-degrading proteinases, among others. Several
recent studies highlight the importance of TAN by using

the above substances to impact tumor immune surveillance,
metastasis, angiogenesis, and cellular proliferation (Fig. 1).
Neutrophil-derived cytokines participate in
immunosculpting
The crosstalk between immune cells and tumor cells that
leads to phenotypic alterations in tumor biology has been
broadly termed immunosculpting or immunoediting (14).
Concrete examples of tumor-mediated signals eliciting protumor responses from neutrophils have been found. For
instance, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF) produced by breast cancer cells has been shown to
elicit the production of the IL-6–like cytokine oncostatin M by
neutrophils in coculture experiments (15). In turn, oncostatin
M–stimulated breast cancer cells exhibited increased VEGF
production and increased invasiveness in Matrigel invasion
assays. Another study revealed that a factor present in the
conditioned media obtained from hepatocellular carcinoma
cells induced the production of hepatocyte growth factor

Figure 1. Effects of neutrophil-derived products on the tumor microenvironment. Neutrophil-derived products play critical roles in a wide range of stages
of tumor progression from the initial genotoxic insult to metastasis to distant sites. Although MMP-8 has a proven role in increasing the tumor cell's ability
to bind laminin and collagen, thus reducing the ability of these cells to metastasize (green arrow), the majority of the neutrophil's effects are protumor
(red arrows), consistent with the poor prognosis associated with neutrophils at the tumor site.

(HGF) from neutrophils, which promoted increased invasiveness by the tumor cells (16). These findings suggest that,
although neutrophils release a paucity of cytokine when
compared with macrophages and other cells within the tumor
microenvironment, the temporal-spatial elaboration of these
substances by PMN plays unique roles.
Reactive oxygen species are genotoxic
The phagolysosomes of neutrophils contain several
enzymes (e.g., NADPH oxidase) capable of reducing molecular
oxygen into superoxide radicals (O2). Additionally, superoxide radicals can be converted into hydrogen peroxide (itself
a potent ROS), which can subsequently be converted via the
actions of the neutrophil-specific enzyme myeloperoxidase
into highly antiseptic hypochlorous acid (HOCl; ref. 17).
Although evolved to disrupt bacterial membranes as a means
of host defense, ROS can nonspecifically exert its effect on host
tissue as well.
In the setting of cancer, ROS associated with infiltrating
neutrophils has been reported to exert both genotoxic effects
(which initiate DNA damage and tumor establishment) and,
conversely, cytotoxic effects leading to tumor regression. For
instance, HOCl was shown to be mutagenic in lung epithelial
A549 cells in vitro, showing at physiologic concentrations a
significant induction of mutations in HPRT (18). Additional
point mutations, DNA strand breaks, and 8-OHdG premalignant lesions have been described upon coculture of neutrophils, with a wide variety of target cells (19). Conversely, HOCl
has been shown to exhibit cytotoxicity to tumor cells via direct
disruption of their cell membranes (20), showing the dual and
contradictory roles ROS displays in the course of tumor
pathogenesis.
Neutrophil integrins promote metastasis
Neutrophils and other inflammatory cells capable of
degrading basement membrane have long been considered
as mediators of tumor cell invasion and distant metastasis
formation. Recently, Huh and colleagues showed that melanoma metastases to the lung were enhanced by the presence
of PMN within alveolar capillaries (21). Melanoma cells
released IL-8, which induced PMN adhesion to vascular
endothelium and enhanced b2 integrin expression (CD11b/
CD18). Melanoma cells then used their ICAM-1 to bind these
PMN to escape the circulation and, ultimately, transverse the
vascular endothelium and emigrate into lung tissue. Whether
neutrophils aided this process by releasing basement membrane degrading proteinases has not yet been investigated.
Polymorphonuclear leukocyte–derived proteinases
assist tumors via matrix-dependent and -independent
means
Neutrophils contain 4 types of granules, which house an
arsenal of proteinases. When released, neutrophil-derived proteinases can process and degrade a wide range of cytokines,
chemokines, and their cognate receptors, in addition to their
well-described ability to remodel extracellular matrix (ECM;
ref. 4). In these ways, proteinases can have profound effects on
tumor proliferation, vessel density, and metastatic potential.

Neutrophil elastase. Neutrophil elastase (NE) is generally considered the major effector of neutrophil function,
making up approximately 2% of the dry weight of a neutrophil. Its main physiologic role seems to be clearance of
invading microorganisms (22). NE exhibits broad substrate
specificity, which includes cytokines, cytokine receptors,
integrins, and nearly all components of the ECM, including
the rather inert elastic fiber (23). Using the LSL–K-ras model
of lung adenocarcinoma, our laboratory has recently shown
that NE promotes tumor growth (24). In vitro studies
revealed that NE exerts differential effects on tumor cells
in a concentration-dependent fashion. We showed that
treatment with modest levels of NE led to proliferation of
A549 lung epithelial tumor cells, whereas higher doses led to
cell death. Colocalization studies showed that NE gained
entry into tumor cells via clathrin-coated pits and trafficked
through early endosomes, the first such demonstration of
the ability of a secreted proteinase to breach the plasma
membrane of a target cell in this manner. Upon gaining
entry to the tumor cell, NE has access to a wide array of
potential substrates among the endosomal and endosomeassociated proteins. Among these potential substrates, we
identified insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) as a target for
NE-mediated cleavage. IRS-1 is a known binding partner of
the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K). Upon IRS-1 degradation, the pool of bioavailable
p85 is increased and free to interact with more potent
growth factors, most notably platelet derived growth factor
receptor (PDGFR). This hyperactivity of the PI3K pathway
leads to uncontrolled tumor cell proliferation (24).
Matrix metalloproteinase-9. Matrix metalloproteinases
(MMP) are enzymes that share broad substrate specificity,
common structural domains, and inhibition by the tissue
inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP). MMP-9 (gelatinaseB) is expressed in many cell types present in the tumor
microenvironment, including all hematopoietic cells and
fibroblasts (25). In neutrophils, MMP-9 is housed in secondary
(specific) granules and, interestingly, neutrophil-derived
MMP-9 does not have an associated TIMP-1 molecule rendering it more prone to activation (26). The contribution of MMP9 to tumor proliferation was first described by Coussens and
colleagues, who reported that MMP-9–deficient mice exhibited reduced keratinocyte hyperproliferation in the human
papilloma virus 16 (HPV16) epidermal tumor model (27). In
this study, bone marrow chimera experiments showed that
MMP-9 derived from the hematopoietic compartment was
responsible for the observed phenotype. More recently, ablation of neutrophils using an antibody against Gr-1 led to a
reduction in pancreatic islet dysplasias in the RIP1-Tag2
pancreatic tumor mouse model. A concomitant reduction
in bioactive VEGF and angiogenic lesions was observed
post–Gr-1 depletion (28). This study suggests that neutrophils
were the sole producers of MMP-9 by using the neutrophilspecific 7/4 antibody in immunofluorescence and flow
cytometry experiments, thus providing strong evidence for
TANs as the source of bioactive MMP-9 within the tumor
microenvironment.

Matrix metalloproteinase-8. The description of
increased skin tumor burden in MMP-8–deficient mice was
the first report of a prohost function for an MMP (29). The
exact means by which MMP-8 retards tumor growth has
remained obscure. For example, only male mice were protected from the 7,12 dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)–
induced skin tumors, which have been difficult to dissect
mechanistically. MMP-8–deficient mice displayed increased
neutrophil infiltrates, which was believed to fuel tumor growth
in that model, although the exact means by which MMP-8
influences inflammatory cell recruitment has not been delineated. MMP-8 has also been shown to be protective in the
Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) model of lung metastasis, confirming the prohost nature of the enzyme (30). Importantly,
immunohistochemistry detection of MMP-8 in human breast
cancer confers a good prognosis, again showing its prohost
function (30). The mechanism by which MMP-8 retards breast
cancer progression, possibly related to increased matrix
adherence, may be distinct from those described in murine
models, as MMP-8 is of tumor cell origin in breast cancer, as
opposed to being purely neutrophil derived in both the LLC
and DMBA models.

Can Neutrophils Be Polarized into Cytotoxic
Phenotypes?
Despite the protumor functions of PMN outlined above,
several earlier studies reported antitumor roles for these cells.
The vast majority of these studies used tumor cell lines
engineered to overexpress nonphysiologic levels of cytokines.
For example, tumors manipulated to overexpress granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) led to the recruitment of
neutrophils to, and the rejection of, the tumors (31). It was
suggested that neutrophils may exhibit direct cytotoxicity
toward the tumor cell in vitro, because in the presence of
antitumor antibodies, neutrophils could lyse tumor cells via
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (32). Thus, in
artificial systems in which neutrophils have been potently
activated (i.e., high levels of G-CSF or antibody/FcR interaction), neutrophils can elicit some antitumor immunity. However, no evidence suggests that neutrophils either target
tumor cells with their proteinases or phagocytose tumor cells
under normal physiologic parameters in vivo. TANs are, in fact,
hyperactivated when compared with naïve circulating PMNs,
but these "moderately" activated PMNs are highly tumor
promoting (33).
Although little data support direct antitumor cytotoxicity
by neutrophils in the unmanipulated tumor microenvironment, recent data suggest that the antitumor–protumor paradigms that exist for macrophage (M1/M2) and T-cell (Th1/
Th2) polarization may also be generated in neutrophils. A
recent study by Fridlender and colleagues suggested that
neutrophils may be able to exhibit unique polarization states
that dictate their impact within the tumor microenvironment.
In this study, inhibition of TGF-b in 2 different murine cancer
models led to the generation of a unique population of
"antitumor" neutrophils, which were hypersegmented, produced high levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and were

2414

Cancer Res; 71(7) April 1, 2011

cytotoxic to tumor cells (34). Depletion of these "antitumor"
neutrophils impairs CD8þ T-cell activation and leads to
increased tumor burden. This study also reported that the
antitumor "N1" cells generated in the absence of TGF-b
produced higher levels of TNF-a, MIP-1a, H2O2, and NO,
and were cytotoxic to tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Although
the data described are a compelling and novel demonstration
of the modification of neutrophil behavior in vivo, we argue
that increased production of these cytotoxic products does
not represent the switch to a unique transcriptional program
per se, but simply a heightened state of activation. Although
this issue is largely a question of semantics, it can be argued
that, whereas T cells that undergo irreversible transcriptional
changes with the expression of the transcription factors T-bet
(Th1) and GATA3 (Th2) and macrophages turn on expression
of a unique set of gene products, including the chitinase genes
(M2), neutrophils simply employ various levels of activation in
response to different stimuli, generating the same products
in higher doses.
Supporting the idea that neutrophil function can be custom
tailored in vivo, another recent study illustrated the ability of
IFN-b to instruct neutrophils to have an antitumor phenotype.
IFN-b–deficient mice exhibited faster growing and more
highly vascularized tumors than wild-type controls, and this
difference was eliminated upon antibody-mediated neutrophil
depletion. In this study, tumor-infiltrating neutrophils
obtained from IFN-b/ mice showed increased levels of
the proangiogenic factors VEGF, MMP-9, and CXCR4. Expression of these genes was reversible as treatment of the IFN-b/
neutrophils ex vivo with IFN-b restored expression of these
factors to control levels (35). Similar to the TGF-b inhibitor
studies described above, alterations in cytokine signals seem
to impact neutrophil function, but the notion that these cells
can be manipulated therapeutically to undergo frank irreversible polarization is unclear. Furthermore, the generation of
highly activated and cytotoxic neutrophils that lack targeting
specificity poses a great threat to host tissues. Similarly,
activated neutrophils, such as those encountered in sepsis,
often result in excessive tissue damage with dire consequences
to the host, including mortality, in the form of acute lung
injuries and septic shock.

Potential for Antineutrophil Therapies
Although the aforementioned evidence indicates a deleterious role for neutrophils in tumor progression, therapeutically
targeting this cell type in cancer is fraught with difficulties.
Neutrophils are critical mediators of host defense against
infection, and depletion of these cells could result in dangerous
levels of immunosuppression. The following are effectively 2
viable strategies: (1) target the CXCL-8/CXCR-1/CXCR-2 axis,
thereby depleting TAN entirely; or (2) target specific PMNderived substances that promote tumor growth. As a proof of
principle, IL-8 antagonists have been successfully employed in
preclinical models to reduce tumor burden (36). Because other
PMN-recruiting chemokines (e.g., CXCL-5, Gro-a, etc.) interact
with CXCR-1/CXCR-2, current focus has been placed on developing receptor antagonists (37) that, in theory, could retard

tumor progression at the tumor, endothelial, and TAN level, as
discussed above. Such agents are currently being tested.
Rather than target the neutrophil as a whole, we have
focused on inhibiting specific neutrophil-derived enzymes
known to promote tumor growth and invasiveness. Studies
in our laboratory have shown that treatment of LSL–K-ras
tumor–bearing mice with the synthetic NE inhibitor ONO5046 reduced tumor growth by 3-fold (24). Although it is true
that NE is an essential mediator of bacterial killing by neutrophils, studies of NE inhibitors in humans for acute lung
injury have yet to show significant immunocompromise.
Newer generation NE inhibitors are currently undergoing early
phase trials for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These studies should be of particular
interest to the cancer community, as it well recognized that
COPD patients are at significantly increased risk to develop
lung cancer independent of cigarette smoke dosage (38).

(particularly in their regulation of cytotoxic T cells), recent
work has overwhelmingly shown that neutrophils promote
tumor progression via matrix degradation, immunosculpting,
tumor cell proliferation, increased metastasis, and enhanced
angiogenesis. Although some studies hint that neutrophils can
be modified or "polarized" such that they become more
cytotoxic to tumor cells, care must be taken to assure that
manipulation of neutrophils in to this highly activated form
does not pose danger to host tissue. A more straightforward
approach of simply inhibiting neutrophil recruitment or neutrophil-derived substances with known tumor-promoting
properties will likely prove more efficacious, and with fewer
concerns for toxicity.

Concluding Remarks

Grant Support

Tumor progression is modified by a wide variety of host
cell types, and the important role of neutrophils has yet to be
fully characterized. Although early studies indicated that
