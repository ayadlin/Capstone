Liver kinase B1 (LKB1, also known as serine/threonine kinase 11, STK11) is a tumor suppressor
mutated in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome and in a variety of sporadic cancers. Herein, we demonstrate
that LKB1 controls the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protects the
genome from oxidative damage. Cells lacking LKB1 exhibit markedly increased intracellular ROS
levels, excessive oxidation of DNA, increased mutation rates, and accumulation of DNA damage,
which are effectively prevented by ectopic expression of LKB1 and by incubation with antioxidant
N-acetylcysteine (NAC). The role of LKB1 in suppressing ROS is independent of AMPK, a
canonical substrate of LKB1. Instead, under the elevated ROS, LKB1 binds to and maintains the
activity of cdc42-PAK1 (p21 activated kinase 1) complex, which triggers the activation of p38 and
its downstream signaling targets, such as ATF-2, thereby enhancing the activity of SOD-2 and
catalase, two antioxidant enzymes that protect the cells from ROS accumulation, DNA damage,
and loss of viability. Our results provide a new paradigm for a non-canonical tumor suppressor
function of LKB1 and highlight the importance of targeting ROS signaling as a potential
therapeutic strategy for cancer cells lacking LKB1.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

The liver kinase B1 (LKB1) gene is mutated in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, an autosomal
dominant inherited disorder characterized by mucosal gastrointestinal polyps and increased
risk for malignant tumors.1–2 LKB1 mutation is also found in sporadic cancers, such as lung
adenocarcinoma and cervical cancers.2–7 Physiologically, LKB1 is involved in multiple
processes including embryonic development, cell polarity, cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis,
metabolism, and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance.2,8–11 LKB1 forms a
heterotrimeric complex with mouse protein 25 and Ste20-related adaptor protein (STRAD),
and phosphorylates at least 13 members of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) super
family.12–17 It was established that LKB1 regulates cell growth and proliferation through
AMPK by controlling tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and p53.18,19

Author Manuscript

LKB1 plays a role in the maintenance of HSC quiescence.9–11 Deletion of Lkb1 resulted in
an initial expansion of HSCs and multipotent progenitor cells and eventually depletion of
not only these cell populations but also mature blood cell types leading to pancytopenia.9–11
One of the explanations for the depletion of HSCs is that LKB1 deficiency leads to
increased DNA damage in response to metabolic and genotoxic stresses. Gurumurthy et al.
observed enhanced expression of phosphorylated histone H2AX (γ-H2AX), a marker of
DNA damage, in hematopoietic tissues of LKB1-deficient mice, indicating an altered DNA
damage response (DDR) in LKB1 deficient cells.10 Consistently, a recent study showed that
LKB1-AMPK signaling regulates non-homologous end joining-associated DNA repair and
contributes to genome stability.20 Thus, it seems plausible that LKB1 plays a role in DDR.

Author Manuscript

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a source of DNA damage, in particular DNA base
damage, which may lead to the accumulation of point and/or deletion mutations and
contribute to tumorigenesis.21–23 Some tumor suppressors and chemical compounds can
directly regulate intracellular redox state to reduce ROS.24–26 A DNA microarray profile
assay showed that LKB1 antagonizes Ras,27 activation of which may induce intracellular
ROS accumulation and oncogenic transformation.28 This study also showed that LKB1
deficient cells possess low GADD45, NAD(P)H menadione oxidoreductase 1, and lysozyme
P, which may participate in oxidative responses.27 To address the possible role of LKB in
regulating cellular oxidative response, in this study, we analyze ROS levels in genetically
manipulated LKB1 cells and provide evidence showing that LKB1 protects the genome
from ROS-induced oxidation by regulating antioxidant gene products.

RESULTS
Increases of intracellular ROS in LKB1 deficient cells
To determine whether LKB1 regulates intracellular oxidative stress response, we measured
ROS levels in LKB1 intact and compromised cells. Under unstressed conditions, LKB1-null

mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) possessed an approximately two-fold higher ROS than
wild-type (WT) MEFs did (Figure 1a). Upon exposure to H2O2, both WT and LKB1-null
cells exhibited a dosage–dependent increase in intracellular ROS (Figure 1a). However,
LKB1-null cells consistently showed a higher level of ROS as compared with WT cells
(Figure 1a). A kinetic analysis of the induction of ROS in cells treated with 50 μM H2O2
showed a consistently higher level in ROS in LKB1 null cells than in their WT counterparts
(Figure 1b). We observed a similar increase in ROS in U2OS/shR-LKB1 cells, a cell line we
established with a stable knockdown of LKB1 (Figure 1c). The antioxidant N-acetyl-Lcysteine (NAC) reduced ROS levels in both LKB1 intact and compromised cells and
abrogated the difference between the two cell lines (Figure 1d). Together, our results suggest
that LKB1 deficiency leads to elevated intracellular ROS levels.
Ectopic expression of LKB1 reduces intracellular ROS

Author Manuscript

To further define the role of LKB1 in the regulation of ROS, we analyzed intracellular ROS
levels in LKB1-deficient HeLa cells and stable HeLa/LKB1 cells that express ectopic
LKB1. At the endogenous level, the average fluorescence intensity (O2−) of HeLa cells was
approximately 25 +/− 3.2. HeLa/LKB1 cells showed a fluorescence intensity of 10 +/− 1.3,
revealing a 60% lower in ROS levels (Figure 1e). Both cell lines displayed a five- to six-fold
increase in the ROS levels following exposure to 5–50 μM H2O2, with ROS levels being
consistently lower in HeLa/LKB1 cells (Figure 1f). The data provide further evidence that
cancer cells expressing LKB1 display lower ROS levels.
LKB1 modulates ROS independent of AMPK

Author Manuscript

LKB1 activates AMPK under stress conditions, such as bioenergetics perturbation.17 It was
reported that ROS are induced when cells are incubated with fatty acids.30 Activation of
AMPK with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR) is capable of
reducing fatty acids-induced ROS, although AICAR had no affect on ROS levels under
basal conditions.30 To determine whether the antioxidant function of LKB1 is mediated by
AMPK, we detected ROS levels in WT and AMPKα-null MEFs. Surprisingly, AMPK status
did not affect intracellular ROS accumulation under endogenous and stress conditions
(Supplementary Figures 1a and b). Next, we knocked down LKB1 using siRNA in WT and
AMPK-null MEFs. The cells were then treated with H2O2. LKB1 knockdown increased
ROS accumulation in both WT and AMPK-null MEFs. Exposure to H2O2 further enhanced
the accumulation of ROS in both cell lines (Supplementary Figures 1c and d). We noted that
LKB1 deletion contributed to a 20% to 100% increase in intracellular ROS regardless the
AMPK status (Supplementary Figure 1d). Thus, we conclude that LKB1-mediated ROS
regulation is at least partially independent of AMPK.

Impaired p38 activation in response to ROS in LKB1 deficient cells
p38 and its mediated signaling are critical targets responding to ROS stress.31–33 To
determine whether LKB1 regulates ROS accumulation through p38, we evaluated p38
signaling in response to H2O2 in WT and LKB1-null MEFs. Phosphorylation of p38 and
JNK was markedly lower in LKB1-null MEFs as compared with that in WT MEFs under the
similar treatment, whereas activation of ERK, another MAPK family member, was not
affected by LKB1 status (Figure 2a). Similarly, phospho-p38 was substantially lower in

LKB1-knocked-down cells treated with H2O2 as compared with that in LKB1-intact cells
under the same condition (Figure 2b). Thus, our results indicate that p38 activation
responding to H2O2 is impaired in the absence of LKB1.
To further determine the role of p38 in mediating the effects of LKB1 on ROS, we tested the
activation of p38 in H2O2-treated U2OS/LKB1 cells, a cell line with stable overexpression
of LKB1. Phospho-p38 was higher in LKB1 overexpression cells than in control cells when
treated with H2O2. A loss-of-function LKB1 mutant, SL26, which does not associate with
STRAD,34 showed only a marginal effect. Phospho-JNK was minimally elevated, whereas
phospho-ERK was not altered by the overexpression of LKB1 (Figure 2c). Pre-treatment
with NAC substantially reduced p38 activation in both LKB1 intact and depleted cells
(Supplementary Figure 2). Thus, our results suggest a role of LKB1 in the activation of p38
in response to ROS.

Author Manuscript

To explore whether LKB1 controls ROS through p38-regulated antioxidant enzymes,32 we
detected the expression of glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1), superoxide dismutase (SOD)
−1 and −2, and catalase in LKB1 intact and deficient cells. GPX1 and SOD-1 were not
altered by LKB1 status and by ROS treatments in our settings (Figures 2a–c). In contrast,
SOD-2 and catalase displayed an appreciable increase in LKB1 intact cells treated with
H2O2, whereas elevations of these two enzymes were markedly restricted in LKB1
compromised cells with the similar treatments (Figures 2a–c). Consistently, enzyme
activities of SOD and catalase were significantly lower in LKB1 deficient cells than those in
LKB1 intact cells regardless of the presence or absence of H2O2 (Figures 2d and e),
suggesting that LKB1 may physiologically regulate SOD and catalase antioxidant enzymes.

LKB1 regulates cdc42-PAK1 complex formation and involves in MKK3/6-p38-ATF-2
signaling activation in response to ROS

Author Manuscript

To determine the functional outcome of amplified p38 activation in LKB1-intact cells, we
detected the downstream targets of p38 in WT and LKB1-null MEFs treated with H2O2. In
WT MEFs, phosphorylation of ATF-2 and MAPKAPK-2, two p38 substrates,35 was
strikingly induced by H2O2, consistent with the activation of p38 (Figure 3a). In contrast,
both ATF-2 and MAPKAPK-2 phosphorylation in LKB1-null MEFs was much less induced
than that in WT MEFs by H2O2 (Figure 3a). Data from genetically manipulated cells with
depletion or overexpression of LKB1 recapitulated these findings (Figures 3b and c). We
also investigated the activation of p38 in response to H2O2 treatment in WT and AMPK-null
MEFs. There was no difference between WT and AMPK-null MEFs in terms of phosphop38 as well as its downstream targets, ATF-2, MSK1, and MAPKAPK-2 (Figure 3a), which
is consistent with the notion that LKB1-mediated ROS regulation is independent of AMPK.
To define the link between LKB1 and p38 phosphorylation under ROS stress, we detected
the expression of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), one of the phosphatases that mediate the
termination of p38 kinase catalytic activity.35 The levels of PP2A were not affected by
genetic manipulations of LKB1 (Figures 3b and c). We then evaluated the activation of p38
upstream kinases under ROS stress in the presence or absence of LKB1. Deficiency of
LKB1 led to a marked decrease in the activation of MAP kinase kinase (MKK) 3/6, two
essential kinases mediated stresses-induced p38 activation (Figures 3a and b).36 Moreover,

ectopic expression of LKB1 increased the phosphorylation of MKK3/6 as compared with
that in empty vector-transfected U2OS cells, whereas mutant LKB1 displayed only a
marginal activity on MKK3/6-p38 signaling (Figure 3c). Together, our data suggest that
LKB1 is required to fully activate the MKK3/6-p38 cascade under ROS stress.

Author Manuscript

Low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins in the Rho family such as Rac1 and Cdc42
have been reported to activate p38 upstream kinases.36–41 p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are
another group of p38 activators by binding to Cdc42 and Rac.37,38 Interestingly, Zhang et al
recently reported that LKB1 colocalizes with and is required for the function of cdc42 and
PAK1 at the cellular leading edge.42 LKB1 interacts only with active form of cdc42 and
PAK.42 To determine whether LKB1-mediated p38 activation involves in cdc42-PAK1, we
analyzed the impact of LKB1 on cdc42-PAK1 complex formation, an essential for the
activity of cdc42-PAK1 on MAP3Ks.36–41 Consistent with previous report,42 LKB1 could
not affect the protein levels of cdc42 and PAK1 (Figure 3d). However, cdc42-PAK1 binding
(complex) was substantially reduced due to lack of LKB1. LKB1 not only affected cdc42PAK1 complex formation, but also located in the complex (Figures 3e and f). Thus, our data
and previous report 42 clearly indicate that LKB1 facilitates the formation of the cdc42-PAK
complex, and hence regulates the signaling events required to activate p38 under stress
conditions.
Integrity of the p38 signaling is necessary for the anti-oxidant function of LKB1

Author Manuscript

To elucidate the role of p38 activation in LKB1-mediated ROS regulation, transfection of a
dominant negative p38 construct (p38-DN) 43 and a specific p38 kinase inhibitor were used
to inhibit p38 signaling in U2OS/shR-Ctrl and U2OS/shR-LKB1 cells followed by treatment
with H2O2. Phospho-p38 decreased dramatically in cells transfected with p38-DN
irrespective of the status of LKB1 and the presence of H2O2 (Figure 4a). Phospho-ATF-2
and phospho-MAPKAPK-2 were also inhibited (Figure 4a). Intracellular ROS levels were
significantly increased in p38-DN transfected U2OS/shR-Ctrl cells as compared to control
vector transfected cells upon the treatment of H2O2 (Figure 4b). A marginal further increase
in ROS was observed in LKB1-depleted cells under the similar treatment (Figure 4b), which
is likely due to residual p38 activity in these cells (Figure 4a).

Author Manuscript

Next, we blocked p38 signaling with SB203580, a pyridinyl imidazole that inhibits the
kinase activity of p38α and p38β without affecting p38 phosphorylation.35 Administration of
SB203580 inhibited the activity of p38 toward its downstream targets and substantially
enhanced the accumulation of ROS in both U2OS/shR-Ctrl and U2OS/shR-LKB1 cells
(Figures 4c and d). Similarly, inhibition of p38 in MEFs led to the accumulation of ROS
(Supplementary Figures 3a and b). In contrast, PD98059 (2′-amino-3′-methoxyflavone), a
flavone derivative and selective p44/42 MAPK inhibitor, did not affect LKB1-associated
ROS regulation (Supplementary Figure 3c). Together, our results suggest that the integrity
of p38 signaling is necessary for LKB1-mediated suppression of ROS.

Ectopic expression of constitutively activated p38α prevents LKB1-deficient cells from the
accumulation of ROS

Author Manuscript

To validate the role of p38 in mediating LKB1-dependent ROS regulation, we established
U2OS/shR-Ctrl and U2OS/shR-LKB1 cells with stable expression of pcDNA3 (Ctrl), p38WT, and a constitutively active form of p38 (p38-CA). Phospho-ATF-2 and PhosphoMAPKAPK-2 were up-regulated in p38-CA and to a lesser extent in p38-WT stable cells
regardless of H2O2 stress (Figure 4e and data not shown). ROS levels were substantially
reduced in U2OS/shR-Ctrl cells transfected with p38-WT and p38-CA as compared with
control vector transfected cells when the cells were exposed to H2O2 (Figure 4f and
Supplementary Figure 4). More importantly, the levels of ROS were also markedly reduced
by the overexpression of p38-CA and p38-WT in U2OS/shR-LKB1 although ectopic
expression of p38-WT showed a relatively lesser effect (Figure 4f and Supplementary
Figures 4b and c). Taken together, our data suggest that p38 activation is sufficient to
abrogate ROS accumulation resulting from LKB1 deficiency.
LKB1 deficiency promotes DNA oxidation and mutagenesis

Author Manuscript

A direct consequence of elevated ROS is oxidative DNA damage and mutagenesis. To
determine whether LKB1-mediated reduction in ROS could translate into a protective role
against oxidative DNA damage, we monitored the formation of 8-oxoguanine (8-oxo-dG), a
major product of DNA oxidation and a source of mutations.25 LKB1 RNAi in U2OS and
SKOV3 cells led to a 60–80% increase in 8-oxo-dG as compared with that in control cells
(Figures 5a–c). In contrast, transfection of LKB1 reduced cellular DNA oxidation
(Supplementary Figure 5a), supporting an antioxidant function of LKB1. Consistently,
inhibition of p38 with SB203580 increased levels of 8-oxo-dG in U2OS/shR-Ctrl cells,
whereas overexpression of p38-CA and p38-WT or administration of NAC markedly
reversed LKB1 deficiency-induced 8-oxo-dG increase (Figure 5b and Supplementary 5b).
Taken together, our data suggest that LKB1 protects the cells from oxidative DNA damage
through the activation of p38 signaling.

Author Manuscript

Oxidative DNA damage is known to be associated with an increased incidence of mutations.
To test the contribution of LKB1-modulated antioxidant mechanism in the protection against
mutations, we monitored the changes in mutation frequencies within the hypoxanthine
phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene locus. Mammalian cells bear a single functional
copy of the hprt gene that codes for HPRT, an enzyme catalyzes phosphoribosylation in the
purine salvage pathway, as well as phosphoribosylation of purine analogues such as 6thioguanine (6-TG) resulting in cytotoxicity. Only cells with an inactivating hprt gene
mutation are able to proliferate in the presence of 6-TG. Thus, resistance to 6-TG indicates
an hprt gene mutation.44 U2OS/shR-LKB1 cells formed 6-fold more 6-TG-resistant colonies
than U2OS/shR-Ctrl cells did (Figures 5d and e). Over-expression of p38-WT in U2OS/shRLKB1 cells reduced the number of 6-TG-resistant colonies to about 50% of those in U2OS/
shR-LKB1 cells, whereas ectopic expression of p38-CA completely abolished the effect of
LKB-depletion (Figure 5e). These results suggest that LKB1 suppresses the mutation
phenotype in ROS-treated cells.

LKB1 deficiency enhances DNA damage induced by ROS

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To identify the function of LKB1 in the protection against DNA damage, we exposed LKB1
compromised and intact cells to H2O2 and measured the formation and repair of DNA SSB
and alkali-labile sites (mainly abasic sites) by the comet assay. The tail moment that reflects
the frequency of breaks was used to quantify DNA damage. In U2OS/shR-LKB1, the level
of damage induced by H2O2 was considerably higher than that in U2OS/shR-Ctrl cells
(Figures 6a and b). When p38 inhibitor was applied, damaged DNA tail moment was
markedly extended in U2OS/shR-ctrl but not U2OS/shR-LKB1 cells. γ-H2AX, another
DNA damage marker, was also increased when the cells were treated with 50–600 μM
H2O2. γ-H2AX levels were much higher in U2OS/shR-LKB1 cells than in U2OS/shR-Ctrl
cells (Figure 6c). Consistent with our findings that p38 mediated the response of LKB1 to
ROS, p38 inhibitor enhanced and p38-CA reduced γ-H2AX formation (Figures 6d and e).
Additionally, the levels of CHK1 and ATM phosphorylation following ROS treatment were
also reduced in LKB1-depleted cells (Figure 6d), suggesting incomplete or delayed DNAdamage repair in addition to the previously reported impaired DNA-damage sensing
function in LKB1 deficient cells.20 Taken together, our results suggest that LKB1 protects
cells from DNA damage induced by ROS and support the notion that p38 is the mediator in
the process.
LKB1 deficiency sensitizes cells to ROS treatments

Author Manuscript

In keeping with our data showing that LKB1 deficiency dramatically enhanced ROS
accumulation (Figures 1a–c), we set out to determine whether cancer cells lacking LKB1
might be more vulnerable to ROS-mediated stress response, in particular, to drugs that
further enhance intracellular ROS. To test our hypothesis, we exposed control and LKB1
knocked-down U2OS and SKOV3 cells to different dosages of H2O2 and analyzed the
cytotoxicity of H2O2. Indeed, depletion of LKB1 markedly sensitized the cells to H2O2,
with an IC50 being 12.5 – 25 μM for LKB1 knocked down cells and 50 – 75 μM for LKB1intact cells (Supplementary Figures 6a and b). To validate the impact of LKB1 status on
cellular viability to oxidative stress, we induced LKB1 expression in A549 cells, a cell line
lacking endogenous LKB1, and exposed the cells to H2O2. Induction of LKB1 substantially
desensitized the cells to H2O2 treatment (Supplementary Figure 6c). Consistent with our
previous notion that LKB1 regulated ROS through activation of p38, application of p38
inhibitor, SB203580 enhanced the sensitivity of LKB1-intact cells to H2O2 and eliminated
the difference in susceptibility to H2O2 between LKB1 intact and compromised cells
(Supplementary Figure 7). In contrast, NAC blocked the cytotoxicity of H2O2 to both cell
lines (Supplementary Figure 8). Thus, our data demonstrate that LKB1 deficiency renders
the cells more susceptible to ROS stress.

Piperlongumine (PL) is an alkaloid isolated from Piper longum L., which possesses selective
anti-cancer properties.45,46 We and several other groups demonstrated that PL treatment
dramatically increases intracellular ROS levels, a likely mechanism by which PL exerts its
selective antitumor effect.45–47 Thus, we interrogated whether LKB1 deficient cells are
more susceptible to PL. We exposed cervical cancer cell lines with or without LKB1 to
various dosages of PL. LKB1 deficient HeLa, SiHa, MS751, and HT-3 cells were generally
sensitive to PL treatments with IC50s around 0.5 μM following a 3-day exposure. In

contrast, LKB1 intact C33-A, CaSki, and ME-180 cells exhibited a relative resistance to the
same treatment with IC50s of 4 μM or higher (Figure 7a, Supplementary Figure 9). Thus,
our results indicate that LKB1 status may be a predictor for cellular outcomes in response to
ROS-related treatments.

Author Manuscript

To further validate the specific role of LKB1 in determining the sensitivity to PL, we treated
C33A/shR-Ctrl and C33A/shR-LKB1 cells with 5 μM PL. We found that treatment of PL
markedly increased intracellular ROS, which were further escalated by the knock-down of
LKB1 (Figure 7b). More importantly, depletion of LKB1 strikingly enhanced the
cytotoxicity of PL (Figure 7c). To corroborate the findings, we established inducible LKB1
expression in HeLa cells. Consistently, reconstitution of LKB1 reduced intracellular ROS
accumulation and conferred a resistance on the cells to PL treatment (Figures 7d and e).
Thus, our results demonstrate a crucial role of LKB1 in determining cellular sensitivity to
ROS-based treatments.
We then sought to determine whether p38α-CA was able to rescue ROS-induced cell death
in LKB1 compromised cells. Indeed, while constitutive expression of p38α-CA significantly
increased the viability of LKB1 knocked-down cells treated with H2O2, ectopic expression
of p38α-CA had little effect on LKB1-intact cell viability (Figure 7f). These data suggest
that the antioxidative role of LKB1 is mediated by p38.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

We have provided new data showing that LKB1 plays an important role in reducing
intracellular ROS in response to oxidant challenge. LKB1 deficiency enhanced oxidative
DNA damage and mutations induced by the accumulation of ROS. Ectopic expression of
LKB1 reduced ROS and ROS-induced DNA damage and mutation. We further
characterized that the protective effect of LKB1 against oxidative stress was mediated by the
activation of p38 MAPK and its downstream targets, such as ATF2, SOD2, and catalase. In
summary, we have proposed a working model for LKB1-induced activation of p38 and its
functional outcome in response to ROS stress (Figure 7g).

Author Manuscript

ROS are the major sources of DNA damage and are substantial factors contributing to the
accumulation of mutations and deletions and chromosome instability, which may lead to
cancer. Thus, reduction of ROS may represent a plausible mechanism underlying the tumor
suppression function of LKB1. Interestingly, however, our data suggest that the antioxidant
effect of LKB1 is independent of AMPK, which was thought to carry out much of the tumor
suppressor function of LKB1.8,19,48 Alexander et al reported that in response to elevated
ROS, ATM activates TSC2 via the LKB1/AMPK metabolic pathway in the cytoplasm to
repress mTORC1 and to induce autophagy.49 This ROS-mediated activation of ATM in the
cytoplasm is distinct from the classical pathway for ATM activation via DNA double-strand
breaks in the nucleus. Based on previous reports and our studies that stresses, such as H2O2
and CDDP treatment (data not shown), enhance the accumulation of LKB1 in the nucleus
and induce the colocalization of LKB1 with ATM, ATR, and other DDR proteins, we
suspect that activation of LKB1 and ATM in the nucleus may still be an important pathway

in response to ROS in addition to the non-classical cytoplasmic ATM-TSC2 signaling
reported.49
Our data suggest that activation of p38 through its upstream kinases was indispensable for
the action of LKB1. We characterized that LKB1 was necessary for maintaining the
integrity of the cdc42-PAK1 complex, which is an important activator for p38 upstream
kinases (MAP3Ks).36–41 A recent report demonstrated that LKB1 colocalizes with cdc42
and PAK1 at the cellular leading edge.42 LKB1 functionality is required for the accurate
localization of cdc42, maintaining active cdc42 levels, and downstream PAK
phosphorylation.42 Thus, our results and previous report42 clearly indicate that LKB1 is a
critical facilitator for the cdc42-PAK signaling and the following response to activate p38
under stress conditions, such as ROS, UV treatment, and inflammation.

Author Manuscript

It was reported that activated p38 promotes the phosphorylation of ATF-2 and hence
enhances the transcription of SOD-2.32 In addition, p38 activation may also stabilize the
mRNA of SOD2 and catalase.32, 50 Consistent with these reports, we showed that not only
was phospho-p38 reduced, but also the expression of SOD-2 and the activity of catalase and
SOD were substantially decreased in LKB1 deficient cells under ROS stress. Thus, current
evidence leads us to speculate that LKB1 possesses the antioxidant function most probably
through p38 signaling-activated antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD2 and catalase.

Author Manuscript

Normal cells maintain redox homeostasis with a low level of basal ROS by controlling the
balance between ROS generation and elimination. In cancer cells, the increase in ROS
generation from metabolic abnormalities and oncogenic signaling may render cancer cells
more dependent on the antioxidant system and more vulnerable to further oxidative stress.21
Therefore, increased ROS levels in LKB1 deficient cells may create an “Achilles’ heel” that
can be exploited to develop improved, individualized therapies against LKB1 compromised
cancers by ROS inducers. Indeed, Shackelford et al 51 recently reported that LKB1-mutant
tumors were sensitive to phenformin, a biguanide compound, which is used to treat diabetes.
The preferential cytotoxicity of phenformin to Lkb1-deleted tumors was associated with a
greater decrease in intracellular ATP, decreased mitochondrial function, and increased
intracellular ROS levels, suggesting that ROS can be targeted for antitumor in the absence of
LKB1. Consistent with the concept, we showed that LKB1 deficient cells were more
sensitive to H2O2 and PL, the latter being a nature compound that produces ROS. Thus, we
anticipate that oxidative stress inducers can be an effective means of selectively eradicating
LKB1 deficient cells, which comprise more than 20% cervical cancers, 30% non-small cell
lung cancer, and many other cancer types.2,3,5,18

Detection of intracellular ROS
Cells were treated with H2O2 for various durations. One hour prior to the termination of the
treatment, 100 ng/ml dihydroethidium was added to the medium. The cells were harvested,
washed, and analyzed by flow cytometry with the red laser channel (FL-3) using a FACscan
analyzer.29,47 ROS were also determined using a 96-well plate-based intracellular ROS
assay as we previously reported.53
Measurement of antioxidant enzymes
Catalase activities were determined by spectrophotometric method as described by Slaughter
and O’Brien.54 SOD activities were estimated as per method described by Madesh and
Balasubramanian.55

HPRT assay

Author Manuscript

The mutation frequency within the HPRT locus was determined by counting 6-TG–resistant
colonies.44 Cells were pre-selected in medium containing hypoxanthine, aminopterine and
thymidine (HAT; Sigma) for 72 h, and grown exponentially for 1–2 weeks to allow
mutations to accumulate. After the treatment, 1×106 cells were seeded onto a 100 mm2-plate
with medium containing 1.35 μM of 6-TG. The number of colonies was counted after 3
weeks.
Alkaline comet assay
We followed the method for alkaline comet assay that we reported previously.56 The cells
were treated and run in alkaline buffer for 20 min, fixed, stained, and examined under the
fluorescence microscope.

LKB1 deficiency promotes DNA oxidation and mutagenesis. (a) LKB1 depletion increases
8-oxo-dG. U2OS/shR-Ctrl and U2OS/shR-LKB1 cells growing on fibronectin-coated
coverslips were treated with 500 μM H2O2 in serum-free and phenol-red-free medium for 2
h at 37°C, fixed in absolute methanol (− 20°C, 20 minutes) and permeabilized with 0.1%
Triton X-100 at room temperature for 15 min. After blocking, the cells were stained with
FITC-conjugated avidin for 1 h at 37°C. Fluorescence is captured with an Olympus IX51
fluorescence microscope. (b) Levels of 8-oxo-dG in LKB1-depleted cells treated with p38
inhibitor and ROS scavenger. U2OS/shR-Ctrl and U2OS/shR-LKB1 cells cultured in 96well plate were pre-treated with 10 μM SB203580 or 5 mM NAC for 2 h before exposure to
500 μM H2O2 for additional 2 h. After the treatment, the cells were fixed in 4 %
paraformadehyde and permeabilized with 0.1 % triton X-100 at room temperature for 15
min. The cells were washed with PBS for 3 times and stained with FITC-conjugated avidin
for 1 h at 37°C. The supernatants were discarded and 100 ul PBS per well was added for
analysis by fluorescence multi-well plate reader with excitation and emission wavelengths of

LKB1 deficiency sensitizes cells to ROS treatments. (a) LKB1 deficient cells are highly
sensitive to ROS inducer, piperlongumine (PL). LKB1 proficient human cervical cancer cell
lines C33A, CaSki, and Me180, and LKB1 deficient cervical cancer cell lines HeLa, SiHa,
MS751, and HT-3 were exposed to 0–8 μM PL for 72 h. Cell viability was determined by
MTT assay. The value of OD530/620nm in cells without treatment was set as 100%. Data
represent average of three independent experiments ± SEM. (b and c) LKB1 depletion
elevates intracellular ROS induced by PL and sensitizes the cells to PL. C33A/shR-Ctrl and
C33A/shR-LKB1 cells were exposed to 5 μM PL for 72 h. After the treatment, the cells
were collected for ROS determination by H2DCFDA staining (b) or cell viability
measurement by MTT assay (c). The values for shR-Ctrl cells without treatment were set as
“1” or 100%. The values are expressed as the mean ± SEM. *P < 0.01 (n = 3). (d and e)
