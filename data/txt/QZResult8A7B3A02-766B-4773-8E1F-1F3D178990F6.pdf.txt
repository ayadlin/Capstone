ABSTRACT
Early alterations in textural characteristics of quantitative ultrasound spectral
parametric maps, in conjunction with changes in their mean values, are demonstrated
here, for the first time, to be capable of predicting ultimate clinical/pathologic
responses of breast cancer patients to chemotherapy. Mechanisms of cell death,
induced by chemotherapy within tumor, introduce morphological alterations in
cancerous cells, resulting in measurable changes in tissue echogenicity. We have
demonstrated that the development of such changes is reflected in early alterations in
textural characteristics of quantitative ultrasound spectral parametric maps, followed
by consequent changes in their mean values. The spectral/textural biomarkers derived
on this basis have been demonstrated as non-invasive surrogates of breast cancer
chemotherapy response. Particularly, spectral biomarkers sensitive to the size and
concentration of acoustic scatterers could predict treatment response of patients with
up to 80% of sensitivity and specificity (p=0.050), after one week within 3-4 months
of chemotherapy. However, textural biomarkers characterizing heterogeneities in
distribution of acoustic scatterers, could differentiate between treatment responding
and non-responding patients with up to 100% sensitivity and 93% specificity
(p=0.002). Such early prediction permits offering effective alternatives to standard
treatment, or switching to a salvage therapy, for refractory patients.

the importance of early predictions of ultimate patient
responses to cancer therapies. Detecting refractory
response of a specific patient to a routine therapy at early
stages can facilitate an alteration in primary treatment,
or even a switch to an early salvage therapy, leading
to potentially better outcomes [1,2]. This has in part
motivated research towards the concept of personalized
cancer therapy with much attention recently in many
aspects of biomedical sciences [3–7].
Breast cancer patients represent a patient population
who may benefit from changing ineffective cancer
therapies to more efficacious treatments [8]. Breast cancer
is a most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second
cause of cancer related death in women [9]. Despite recent
improvements with the detection of breast cancer at early
stages, a considerable fraction of this patient population
is diagnosed with late stage disease. An estimated 5-20%
of newly diagnosed cases remain still classified as locally
advanced breast cancer (LABC) [10,11], with even larger
proportions outside of North America. Locally advanced
breast cancer, according to clinical guidelines, includes
stage III and a subset of stage IIB (T3N0) disease and
often presents as tumors which are frequently greater
than 5 cm, involving the chest wall and/or classified as
inflammatory breast cancer. Locally advanced breast
cancer patients generally have poor long-term survival
rates (five-year survival rate of 55%, approximately) in
comparison to the early stage patients, mainly due to the
progression of the disease and a high risk of metastatic
spread [11].
Locally advanced breast cancer patients are currently
treated with aggressive therapeutic combinations, often
with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery,
radiation therapy, and when indicated, Herceptin and/or
hormonal manipulation [12–14]. Within this therapeutic
scenario, the importance of clinical and pathologic
complete response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy has
been highlighted, in several studies, as a marker of better
outcomes (with survival rates reaching 70% with complete
response) [15,16]. However this prognostic factor is
often assessed at the time of surgery, far too late to make
any modification to a neo-adjuvant treatment. This is
mainly due to the fact that standard clinical surrogates
based on on-going physical assessment by palpation,
or using conventional clinical imaging such as x-ray
mammography, or B-mode ultrasound, suffer from an
inability to objectively evaluate treatment response early
on during a course of treatment [17].
Despite the complicated nature of responses to
cancer treatments, tumor cell death frequently results
in micro-structural and gross functional alterations in
tumors which are measurable even at early stages [18–
24]. These alterations are introduced through different
physiological mechanisms and can be monitored using
functional imaging techniques [25,26]. Accumulation
of such early micro-alterations, in long term, results in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

macroscopic changes in the physical properties of tumors
such as their size, which is currently used as a standard
clinical criterion of tumor response to treatment [27,28].
Therefore, the quantification of these microscopic changes
in tumor physiology has a high potential for accurately
predicting ultimate tumor response early on during a
course of treatment. In this context, a number of imaging
modalities, including positron emission tomography (PET)
[4], magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [29,30], diffuse
optical spectroscopy (DOS) [31,32], and elastography
[33], have recently been demonstrated for evaluating
cancer treatment responses within weeks to months after
the start of treatment.
Investigators have recently undertaken genetic
approaches for therapy response monitoring. Analyses of
circulating tumor DNA to monitor breast cancer response
to treatment early on during a course of treatment have
shown promise [34]. However, regardless of providing
useful scientific perspective, the proposed method is by
necessity invasive requiring time-consuming analyses
for quantification of circulating tumor DNA and gene
sequencing. In terms of imaging modalities, PET
remains costly, requiring radionuclide contrast agent,
and thus limiting the number of times each patient can be
evaluated during a treatment course. Although DOS and
elastography have also shown potential for distinguishing
treatment resistive patients, they remain investigational.
Clinical ultrasound (US) is a low-cost and portable
imaging modality with a short imaging time and a
relatively high spatial resolution. In recent preclinical
studies quantitative ultrasound (QUS) techniques at
both high and conventional-frequencies have been
demonstrated in the detection and quantification of cell
death in response to cancer treatments [23,35,36]. These
include treatments with chemotherapy, photodynamic
therapy, radiation therapy, anti-vascular treatment, or
combined therapies [37]. A very recent pilot clinical study
also investigated these techniques for evaluating patient
responses to chemotherapy [38]. In particular, mid-band
fit (MBF) and 0-MHz intercept spectral parameters which
can be linked to ultrasound backscatter power, and size
and concentration of acoustic scatterers [39,40], have
shown promise. In addition, textural properties of QUS
spectral parametric maps, including contrast, correlation,
and homogeneity of MBF and 0-MHz intercept, have
been investigated preclinically [41,42]. Such parameters
that quantify the spatial relationship between neighboring
acoustic scatterers within tissue micro-structures, have
been demonstrated capable of characterizing response
heterogeneities, with more sensitivity and higher levels
of correlation to histological cell death, compared to
mean values of the spectral parameters [41,42]. These
parameters can be potentially applied for assessing
response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in LABC patients.
Based on the rationale that responses in tumors
are spatially inhomogeneous [43], this study evaluates,

for the first time, the efficacy of textural characteristics
of QUS spectral parametric maps for the prediction of
tumor response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in LABC
patients, early on during a course of treatment. Obtained
results demonstrated statistically significant differences in
changes observed in survival-linked textural biomarkers
extracted from MBF and 0-MHz intercept parametric
maps between treatment responders and non-responders,
one week after the start of treatment. Whereas changes
in mean values of mid-band fit and 0-MHz intercept
only became statistically significant after four weeks of
treatment. This study thus suggests for the first time that
QUS spectroscopic methods in conjunction with textural
analysis techniques can be used non-invasively to predict
patient responses to clinical cancer therapies within
days after treatment initiation. This work establishes a
framework enabling acquisition of rapid and quantitative
information to evaluate and predict responses of cancer
patients to the treatments. Such a system can in the future
facilitate customization of treatment for cancer patients on
an individual basis.

weeks of treatment, are presented in Figure 1. An overall
increase in the ultrasound spectral backscatter power
was detectable within the tumor region of the responding
patients, visualized as considerable changes in the MBF
and 0-MHz intercept parametric images during the course
of treatment. Particularly, increases of 3.7 ± 1.5 dBr and
6.8 ± 1.7 dBr for MBF, and 1.9 ± 0.9 dBr and 2.3 ± 0.5
dBr for 0-MHz intercept, were measured, on average,
after one and four weeks of treatment for the responding
patients. No such increase was observed in the case of
non-responding patients, where changes of -2.1 ± 1.8 dBr
and -4.9 ± 6.0 dBr for MBF, and -1.8 ± 1.4 dBr and -0.4 ±
1.6 dBr for 0-MHz intercept, were estimated, on average,
after one and four weeks of treatment. Light microscopy
images acquired from whole-mount histopathology
sections of mastectomy specimens for a responding
patient, and two non-responding patients with stable and
progressive disease, respectively, are presented in Figure
2. In the cases of responding patients chemotherapy
effect was clearly detectable within the tumor bed with

RESULTS
Characteristics of the patients who participated
in this study, their tumor properties, and the treatments
administrated have been summarized in Table 1A.
The patients (n=20) had an average age of 45 years
(SD=7.4, range: 33-57), and an average tumor size of
7.3 cm (SD=2.8, range: 3-13) with respect to the largest
tumor dimension. Nineteen patients had invasive ductal
carcinoma, one had metaplastic carcinoma, and eleven
patients had tumors with positive estrogen and/or
progesterone receptors (ER/PR+), whereas eight patients
had a Her-2-Neu positive (HER2+) status. The majority
of patients received combined anthracycline and taxanebased chemotherapy. The clinical/pathologic responses of
patients to their neo-adjuvant chemotherapy are presented
in Table 1B. Patients 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19,
and 20 had either a complete pathologic response, or had
reductions of more than 50% in their tumor size along
with detectable decreases in tumor cellularity, and were
categorized as responders. In the case of patients 2, 15,
and 16 a substantial reduction in physical size of mass
was not detected, however residual tumor cellularity was
very low and these patients were clinically/pathologically
recognized as responders. Patients 3, 8, 10, 11, and 18
demonstrated progressive disease, or only slight changes
in their tumor size during treatment along with high
residual tumor cellularity, and were classified as nonresponders.

responding patients over the course of treatment is
presented in Figure 3. Among the ultrasound-based
parameters investigated, a large number of textural and
spectral biomarkers exhibited a statistically significant
difference between treatment responding and nonresponding populations after one and four weeks
of treatment. Particularly, statistically significant
differences were observed after one week of treatment
in MBF %ContrastΔ (p=0.002), MBF %CorrelationΔ
(p=0.044), MBF %HomogeneityΔ (p=0.003), 0-MHz
intercept %ContrastΔ (p=0.040), and 0-MHz intercept
%HomogeneityΔ (p=0.035) between the two patient
populations, whereas MBF %MeanΔ (p=0.054), 0-MHz
intercept %MeanΔ (p=0.071), Slope %ContrastΔ
(p=0.091), and Slope %HomogeneityΔ (p=0.090)
approached the statistical significance. After four
weeks of treatment, MBF %ContrastΔ (p=0.021), MBF
%CorrelationΔ (p=0.028), MBF %HomogeneityΔ
(p=0.021), MBF %MeanΔ (p=0.021), and 0-MHz
intercept %MeanΔ (p=0.046) demonstrated statistically
significant differences between the two populations. The
mean of the slope parameter (slope %MeanΔ) remained
almost invariant during the course of treatment within the
two patient populations and was not demonstrated to be a
statistically significant biomarker.
Results of discriminant analyses performed using
the quantitative ultrasound-based biomarkers measured
at week 1 of treatment are presented in Figures 4, and
Table 2. Figure 4 illustrates the scatter plots of the patient
data in the %MeanΔ, %ContrastΔ, %CorrelationΔ, and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

%HomogeneityΔ feature planes of MBF and 0-MHz
intercept parameters, and in a combined feature plane of
these spectral and textural biomarkers derived from their
parametric images. In These plots, the determined borders
of the treatment response classes have been shown by
dashed lines. The plots suggest that the textural biomarkers,
particularly %ContrastΔ and %HomogeneityΔ, provide
considerably better separability between the two patient
populations after one week of treatment, compared to the
simple average-based values (%MeanΔ) of the spectral
parameters. The results presented in Figure 4 also reflect a
greater separability within a combined feature plane of the
spectral and textural biomarkers derived from MBF and
0-MHz intercept parametric images. Table 2 summarizes
the results of the ultrasound-based treatment response
classification, in terms of sensitivities, specificities, and
areas under the ROC curve obtained. In particular, the
discriminant analyses resulted in sensitivities, specificities,
and areas under the ROC curve of 100%, 93%, and 0.99
for MBF %ContrastΔ, 100%, 93%, and 0.97 for MBF
%HomogeneityΔ, and 100%, 67%, and 0.80 for 0-MHz
intercept %HomogeneityΔ after one week of treatment,
whereas the MBF %MeanΔ demonstrated 80%, 80% and
0.84, and 0-MHz intercept %MeanΔ showed 80%, 80%,
and 0.85 for sensitivity, specificity, and area under the
ROC curve, respectively. The %ContrastΔ of MBF and
0-MHz intercept parameters in a combination, similar to
%HomogeneityΔ, demonstrated a sensitivity of 100%, a
specificity of 93%, and an area under the ROC curve of
0.99 for treatment response classification of the patients

after one week of chemotherapy. A combination of the
spectral and textural biomarkers extracted from parametric
images of MBF and 0-MHz intercept (eight biomarkers in
total), however, revealed the best results with sensitivity
and specificity of 100% (p<0.001), and area under the
ROC curve of 1.0.
Figure 5 demonstrates results of the recurrencefree survival analyses. The plots present the survival
curves calculated for the responding and non-responding
patient populations based on the QUS spectral (MBF and
0-MHz intercept %MeanΔ) and textural (MBF and 0-MHz
intercept %ContratsΔ) biomarkers obtained one week after
the start of chemotherapy, and those calculated months
later based on ultimate clinical/pathologic responses of

the patients. The survival curves obtained based on the
QUS spectral biomarkers at week 1 of treatment did
not show a statistically significant difference between
the treatment outcomes of the two patient populations
(p=0.220). However a statistically significant difference
was observed between the survival curves obtained based
on the QUS textural biomarkers at week 1 of the treatment
(p=0.003). In addition, a statistically significant difference
was found between the survival curves obtained months
later based on the ultimate clinical/pathologic responses of
the patients (p<0.001). Early survival analyses conducted
at week 1 based on the combined QUS spectral and
textural biomarkers in a hybrid profile also resulted in the

changes in their mean values, can be non-invasively
applied as early surrogates of clinical and pathologic
treatment response exhibited by LABC patients to
chemotherapy. Twenty women with LABC were monitored
during the course of their neo-adjuvant chemotherapy
and evaluated in terms of current clinical methods. The
patients were also monitored with quantitative ultrasoundbased spectral and textural parameters as non-invasive
“biomarkers” of therapy response, measured for each
patient over the course of treatment. The patients were
consequently assessed after surgery with whole-mount
histopathology analysis on mastectomy specimens.
Obtained results demonstrate that the patients who were
categorized ultimately as non-responders, according to the
clinical and pathologic guidelines, exhibited considerably
different trends for change in their corresponding
ultrasound-based biomarkers over the course of treatment,
compared to the clinical and pathologic responding
patients. Statistically significant differences were exhibited
between the two treatment response populations with
respect to textural and spectral biomarkers, after one and
four weeks of treatment, respectively.
Scatter plots of the patients’ data in different feature
planes of the quantitative ultrasound-based biomarkers
demonstrated a very good separability of two treatment
response populations at week 1 of chemotherapy. In this
context, the separability provided by the ultrasound-based
textural biomarkers after one week of treatment was better,
compared to the one corresponding to the simple averagebased spectral biomarkers. However, a hybrid profile
of textural and spectral biomarkers resulted in the best
separability between the two patient populations. In this
case, the combination of spectral and textural biomarkers
derived from the MBF and 0-MHz intercept parametric
maps resulted in 100% sensitivity and specificity via
a linear discriminant analysis performed for detecting
non-responding patients. This implies that quantitative
ultrasound-based spectral biomarkers can provide more
information, when combined with the textural biomarkers,
for treatment response monitoring, even at early stages
after treatment. These QUS biomarkers, in a combination,
may be applied for early prediction of ultimate treatment
response in patients undergoing cancer-targeting therapies.
Such an early prediction could be used to facilitate the
decision of switching to a more effective therapy for
treatment-refractory patients or even shifting to a salvage
therapy, early on during a course of treatment.
Considering the levels of statistical significance of
the textural and spectral biomarkers at week 1 and week
4 of treatment, the results observed in this study suggest
that alterations in the textural properties of QUS spectral
parametric maps become apparent at early stages of
treatment, and will consequently result in more detectable
changes in the mean values of these maps. This can be
due to the fact that development of response in tumor
cells is a gradual process which initially affects tissue

DISCUSSION
The results presented in this study indicate for the
first time that alteration in the textural characteristics
of QUS spectral parametric maps, complemented by

and non-responding patient populations, determined
based on quantitative ultrasound spectral biomarkers

biomarkers resulted in the same curves as obtained based on

micro-structures heterogeneously. In contrast to late
effects that are more homogenous, the heterogeneous
nature of the initial cell death progress and response
development is expected to influence, at early stages, the
textural properties of QUS spectral parametric images.
Here, theses are demonstrated capable of characterizing
tissue micro-structure effects. A gradual late accumulation
of such heterogeneous alterations in the tissue microstructures is anticipated to result in more detectable
changes in the mean values of the QUS spectral parametric
images at later stages [38], as confirmed in this study by
a greater statistically significant difference between the
two patient populations at week 4 of treatment. Previous
pre-clinical studies on xenograft tumor models in vivo
support the results observed in this study. In those studies,
ultrasound-based textural parameters were found to be
more sensitive to cell death, compared to mean values of
the spectral parameters [41]. Textural parameters were also
demonstrated to be capable of detecting changes in tissue
micro-structures with a higher correlation to histological
cell death, specially at early stages after chemotherapy
exposure.
It was demonstrated in previous in vitro and
in vivo investigations of ultrasound-based cell death
detection that nuclear condensation and fragmentation
in cell death can result in alterations in characteristics of
ultrasonic backscatter signals, even at clinically-relevant
conventional low frequencies [22,35,36,41,44]. This is
consistent with observations in this study, in which such
alterations were characterized by ultrasound-based spectral
and textural parameters. Banihashmei et al. demonstrated
that the cellular-based sub-resolution scatterers can affect
ultrasound backscatter signal at low-frequency with
cell death and evidence for the role of cell death related
nuclear changes has been summarized there [23].
Results obtained in this study (Figure 3)
demonstrated a lesser difference between responding and
non-responding patients after eight weeks of treatment
and months later prior to surgery. At the eighth week of
treatment, the non-responders appear to show a late low
level of response to therapy. In addition, a number of
partial responders may have their tumor cells repopulated
in partial regions exhibiting small levels of response. At
the time of ultrasound data collection prior to surgery, the
neo-adjuvant chemotherapy has been stopped for several
weeks, and thus minimal cell death is expected. Also the
complete pathologic responders, who have no residual
tumor left in ultrasound scans, are not expected to show
response and were excluded from the analysis at that
time. Therefore, having less difference between the two
patient populations can be expected at these times, since
changes in the quantitative ultrasound-based biomarkers
are expected to show the development of response for each
patient.
Attenuation was accounted for in this study by
a sliding window normalization process with data
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

normalized using a tissue-mimicking phantom data,
acquired under identical scan settings. In addition, the
0-MHz intercept, sensitive to the concentration of acoustic
scatterers was derived, with parametric maps generated
for each scan, as it is believed theoretically to be free of
attenuation effects [40].
Previous studies have investigated the application of
other functional imaging modalities for cancer treatment
response monitoring. Examples include the modalities
based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron
emission tomography (PET), diffuse optical imaging
(DOI), and elastography [25,26,31–33,43]. Unlike
the methods based on MRI and PET modalities, the
ultrasound-based biomarkers investigated in this study
rely on intrinsic contrast alterations arising from changes
in the acoustical characteristics of cancer cells when they
die, and hence the method does not require the injection
of any exogenous contrast agent. Elastography techniques
have recently been reported useful for distinguishing
between treatment responding and non-responding
patients at the fourth week of chemotherapy, but not
as early as one week [33]. In methods based on diffuse
optical imaging, the lower resolution available may cause
uncertainties for determining tumor boundaries, specially
in the case of smaller tumors. Ultrasound is a portable and
high resolution imaging modality that has the advantages
of low cost and short imaging time, and can access tumor
location not easily visualized with that modality. Genetic
approaches have also been investigated recently for cancer
therapy response monitoring [34]. Compared to these
approaches, QUS biomarkers can provide a non-invasive
insight of treatment response, needless of time-consuming
analyses for quantification of circulating tumor DNA and
gene sequencing.
In the study here, week 1 ultrasound biomarkers
already indicated links to differential patient outcomes in
terms of progression-free survival. At week 1, albeit in a
small patient population, the combined ultrasound-based
biomarkers in a hybrid profile resulted in outcomes which
matched those based on ultimate pathology of patients,
available months later, after their surgery.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the
first time that early alterations in textural characteristics
of QUS spectral parametric maps, complemented by
changes in their mean values, can be clinically applied
to predict ultimate clinical and pathologic responses of
breast cancer patients to chemotherapy. Results indicate
that treatment-refractory patients demonstrated different
trends in measured ultrasound-based biomarkers over the
course of treatment, compared to clinical and pathologic
responding patients, and with statistical significance
after one week and at the fourth week of treatment. The
proposed biomarkers were also found to have a very good
sensitivity and specificity to distinguish patients with
poor ultimate response to the therapy, early-on following
treatment initiation, and even with more accuracy when

combined into a hybrid ultrasound-response profile.
The promising results presented in this study suggest
that these quantitative ultrasound-based biomarkers, as
early survival-linked surrogates of ultimate treatment
response to cancer-targeting therapies, may be applied to
facilitate switching an inefficient treatment regimen for
a particular refractory patient to a more effective one, or
even undertaking a salvage treatment, early on after the
therapy initiation [8].

included patients with progressive disease in which the
tumor volume increased despite treatment [27,46,47]. In
cases where the tumor cellularity was very low (overall
volume of viable tumor cells), the patient was considered
as a responder as well, even if the diminishment in the
physical tumor size was less than 50%.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

All the ultrasound data in this study were collected
by the same sonographer following standardized protocols
for data acquisition. Ultrasound data was acquired with
patients lying supine with their arms above their heads.
Ultrasound data was acquired at 5 times during course
of treatment for each patient. The first scan was acquired
immediately prior to the start of chemotherapy which was
used as a baseline of comparison for subsequent scans. The
following three scans were acquired during the first, fourth
and eighth week of treatment, with a fifth scan acquired
within one week prior to the modified radical mastectomy
surgery. The mastectomy surgery was typically carried out
four to six weeks after the course of chemotherapy was
completed.
Conventional B-mode images and ultrasound
radiofrequency (RF) data were acquired using a Sonix RP,
(Ultrasonix Vancouver, Canada) system utilizing a L145/60 transducer with a transmit frequency of 10 MHz,
resulting in a frequency bandwidth with a centre frequency
of ~7 MHz. The ultrasound RF data were digitized with
a sampling frequency of 40 MHz. The transducer focus
was set at varying depths depending on individual patient
circumstances. Scan focal depths remained consistent for
individual patients throughout the study. Breast regions
selected for ultrasound scanning were directed by an
oncologist, who determined acquisition scan planes via
physical examination of the patient. Data was acquired
in a single continuous sweep over the entire tumor
volume in order to provide context regarding changes in
localization and dimensionality of the tumor across visits.
Scans of individual tumor regions were also acquired at
approximately 1 cm increments across the whole tumor
volume.

Ultrasound Data Collection

Study Protocol
This study was conducted in accordance with
institutional research ethics approval from Sunnybrook
Health Sciences Centre. The study was open to all women
with LABC aged 18 to 85. Eligible patients were recruited
for the study after obtaining written informed consent.
Prior to therapy, all patients underwent a core needle
biopsy to confirm a cancer diagnosis, where information
regarding histological subtype and hormone receptor status
of tumor were recorded. Pre-treatment magnetic resonance
(MR) images of the breast were acquired for each patient
in order to determine initial tumor size and to perform a
metastatic workup as necessary as part of the institutional
standard of clinical care for such patients. Patients were
followed clinically by oncologists who remained blinded
to the study results. Physical examination was conducted
with each cycle of chemotherapy and size and stiffness
of tumor was assessed by clinicians. Post-treatment MRI
scans of the breast were also acquired immediately before
patient surgery to measure residual tumor size. Patients
were also followed clinically up to 50 months after their
treatment and their clinical data were recorded for a
recurrence-free survival study.
Following surgery, patient mastectomy specimens
were mounted on whole-mount [45] 5”×7” pathology
slides and were consequently stained with haematoxylin
and eosin (H&E). The pathology slides were digitized
using a confocal scanner (TISSUEscope™, Huron
Technologies, Waterloo, ON) at 2 micron resolution.
All cases were examined by the same pathologist, who
provided information regarding tumor grade, residual
size, extent of cellularity, and tumor response. Patient
responses were categorized following standard guidelines
based upon changes in overall tumor volume in addition
to the residual tumor cellularity [27,46,47]. Patients
were considered as responders if there was a decrease in
tumor size of 50% or more, and included patients which
were deemed to have a complete pathologic response to
treatment (no residual invasive carcinoma) [27,46,47].
Conversely, patients were deemed to be non-responders
if there was less than a 50% decrease in tumor size and

Ultrasound Data Analysis
Analysis of ultrasound RF data was carried out
using quantitative ultrasound spectroscopy, followed by
textural analysis on parametric images of the spectral
biomarkers obtained. Quantitative ultrasound spectroscopy
was performed using linear regression analysis of the
normalized power spectrum [22,23,35,36,39,40], applying
a sliding window analysis for generating parametric
images. Ultrasound data was analyzed across all
acquired planes through the scan volume which included
identifiable tumor regions, and parametric images were
3507

generated for each cross-sectional plane (described
further below). Analysis parameters were reported from
data within a region of interest (ROI) located at the
tumor central area which was consistently positioned
at the transducer focal depth, typically accounting for
approximately two third of the tumor area in the plane.
Obtained values of parameters for each scan were reported
as tumor volumetric averages (detailed below).
The power spectrum was calculated using a Fourier
transform of the raw RF signal for each scan line through
the whole field of view of the ultrasound data. In order to
remove the effects of system transfer functions, transducer
beam-forming, and diffraction artefacts, in addition
to acting as a mechanism of depth related attenuation
correction, data were normalized using a sliding window
analysis with the power spectrum obtained from a glassbead-embedded agar-gel phantom model [48], with
properties similar to those of breast tissue (modified from
[49]). Phantom data was acquired for each setting used
during patient data acquisition, including variations in
image gain and focal depth. Each sliding window was
normalized separately to a reference curve obtained
from the same region of the phantom, with equivalent
location and size. This was carried out in order to more
accurately account for the effects of attenuation and beam
diffraction across the region of interest especially in larger
tumors. Linear regression analysis was performed on
the normalized power spectrum within a -6 dB window
from the transducer centre frequency determined from a
calibration pulse, to generate a best-fit line. Parameters
subsequently reported included the mid-band fit, the
spectral slope, and the corresponding 0-MHz intercept
[23,35,39,40], as ultrasound-based spectral biomarkers of
treatment response. The parametric images were generated
using the sliding window analysis on a pixel by pixel
basis, with the parameters calculated for each window
and assigned to its centre. The size of the sliding window
was selected to cover approximately 10 wavelengths in
order to obtain more reliable spectral parameters which
are independent of window length [50].
In addition to the mean values of these spectral
biomarkers determined by averaging on the generated
parametric images, textural properties of each parametric
map were also characterized to derive ultrasound-based
textural biomarkers of heterogeneous therapy response.
Textural analysis was performed based on a gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) [51]. Such a matrix represents
the angular relationship between neighboring pixels as
well as the distance between them [52], comprising highorder textural information about patterns of neighboring
pixels in an image. Symmetric GLCMs were constructed
considering each pixel’s neighbors located at different
distances and directions, i.e., at angles of 0˚ (180˚), 45˚
(225˚), 90˚ (270˚), and 135˚ (315˚). Textural parameters
(contrast, correlation, and homogeneity) were extracted
from the corresponding GLCMs of each spectral
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

parametric image, and were subsequently averaged [51].
Among the textural parameters determined, contrast
represents a measure of difference between the lowest
and highest intensities in a set of pixels, correlation
quantifies the intensity correlation between pixel pairs,
and homogeneity measures the incidence of pixel pairs of
different intensities. All the mean values and the textural
parameters were determined for each of the scan planes
collected per patient visit, and subsequently averaged
across the tumor volume.
Comparison of each patient’s data during the course
of treatment was conducted using their corresponding data
acquired prior to the treatment initiation, as the baseline.
The values of each quantitative parameter for clinically
and pathologically determined responders and nonresponders were compared independently for each time.
Normality violations for each parameter were examined
using a one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (PASW
Statistics 18, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Depending on
whether the changes were normally distributed or not,
statistical analyses using either a t-test or a two-sample
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (two-sided, 95% confidence)
were carried out, respectively, to assess if responding and
non-responding patient populations exhibit statistically
significant differences in changes measured for the
quantitative ultrasound-based biomarkers during the
course of treatment. Linear discriminant analyses were
used to determine which quantitative parameter better
discriminated between responders and non-responders.
Sensitivity and specificity were calculated in addition
to receiver operating characteristics (ROC), in order to
measure the performance of the quantitative ultrasoundbased treatment response classification method compared
to clinically and pathologically determined responses.
Survival analyses were performed to generate recurrencefree Kaplan-Meier survival curves for responding and
non-responding patient populations, determined based
on ultrasound-based biomarkers, and based on ultimate
clinical/pathologic responses. Survival curves obtained
for the two patient populations were compared using a
log-rank test to evaluate if they demonstrate statistically
significant differences between the treatment outcomes.
