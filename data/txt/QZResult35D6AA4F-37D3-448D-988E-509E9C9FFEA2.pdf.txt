Abstract
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cancers evolve by a reiterative process of clonal expansion, genetic diversification and clonal
selection within the adaptive landscapes of tissue ecosystems. The dynamics are complex with
highly variable patterns of genetic diversity and resultant clonal architecture. Therapeutic
intervention may decimate cancer clones, and erode their habitats, but inadvertently provides
potent selective pressure for the expansion of resistant variants. The inherently Darwinian
character of cancer lies at the heart of therapeutic failure but perhaps also holds the key to more
effective control.
Cancer is a major cause of mortality throughout the world and despite the extraordinary
amount of effort and money expended over the past several decades, successful eradication
and control of advanced disease remains elusive1. In parallel, our understanding of cancer
biology and genetics has changed beyond recognition2. The translation of cancer genomics
to cancer therapy needs to accommodate the cellular complexity of the disease and address
its dynamic, evolutionary character. The latter provides both barriers to success and
opportunities.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In 1976 Peter Nowell3 published a landmark perspective on cancer as an evolutionary
process, driven by stepwise, somatic cell mutations with sequential, sub-clonal selection.
The implicit parallel was to Darwinian natural selection with cancer equivalent to an
asexually reproducing, unicellular, quasi-species. The modern era of cancer biology and
genomics has validated the fundamentals of cancer as a complex, Darwinian, adaptive
system4,5 (Box 1, and additional references in Supplemental information).
Box 1
Cancer as a Complex System
•

Cancers exist in an extraordinary variety of taxonomically, quasi-classes,
genera, species, characterised by divergent cells of origin and mutational
spectra. Each cancer is individually unique.

•

Cancers evolve over variable time frames (~1–50 years) and tempos and, in any
one patient, the clonal structure, genotype and phenotype shifts over time.
Contemporaneously, any one cancer is, in effect, multiply different (sub-clonal)
cancers occupying overlapping or distinct tissue habitats.

•

The number of mutations found in any cancer can vary from a handful (10–20)
to (more usually) hundreds of thousands. The great majority are ‘passengers’, a

modest but undefined number being functionally relevant ‘drivers’. The
mutational processes are very diverse.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

•

Cancers acquire, via mutational (and epigenetic) changes, a variety of critical
phenotype traits that compound to empower territorial expansion, via
proliferative self-renewal, migration and invasion; properties that are part and
parcel of normal developmental, physiological and repair processes.

•

Advanced, disseminated or very malignant cancers appear to be almost uniquely
competent to evade therapy.

•

Most, if not all, of this complexity can be explained by classical evolutionary
principles.

Cancer clone evolution takes place within tissue ecosystem habitats which have themselves
evolved over a billion years. Their complex anatomies and networked signals have evolved
to optimise and integrate multi-cellular functions whilst restraining renegade clonal
expansion. The balance however is delicate as the resilience of multi-cellular and long-lived
animals such as ourselves depend upon the very phenotypic properties that, if not tightly
regulated, drive or sustain malignancy, i.e. self-renewal coupled with stabilization of
telomeres that allows extensive proliferation, angiogenesis, cell migration and invasion6.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Tissues provide the context for cancer cell evolution. The usually protracted time required
for the clinical emergence of cancer and the resultant mutational complexity often reflect the
sequential and random ‘searches’ for phenotypic solutions to micro-environmental
constraints. The evolutionary progression of cancer is more often than not stalled or aborted,
as revealed by the high frequencies of clinically covert pre-malignant lesions7–9. Cancer
suppressive mechanisms relegate most cancers to old age where they have little effect on the
reproductive fitness of their hosts.
Resource limitations and other micro-environmental constraints limit the size of tumours at
multiple stages of progression. Even full-blown malignancies often exhibit Gompertzian
growth10. The doubling time of cancer cells (~1–2 days) is orders of magnitude faster than
the doubling time of tumours (~60–200 days)10, implying that the vast majority of cancer
cells die before they can divide11. Thus, natural selection in tumours, like selection among
organisms, often takes place through severe competition for space and resources.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Oncologists change cancer clone dynamics dramatically by introducing a new potent source
of ‘artificial’ selection – with drugs or radiotherapy. But similar evolutionary principles
apply. Massive cell death will usually ensue providing selective pressure for the
proliferation of variant cells that can, by one of several mechanisms (see below), resist
therapeutic oblivion. To make matters worse, many cancer therapeutics are genotoxic;
surviving cells regenerating the cancer may have incurred additional mutational insults,
some of which could improve their fitness and malignant potential.
These general considerations suggest that much can be gained by applying the tools and
insights of evolutionary biology and ecology to the dynamics of cancer pre- and posttreatment. Here, we provide a portrait of cancer as an evolutionary process and argue that
this can both explain our modest therapeutic returns and suggest alternative strategies for
effective control.

natural selection of the fittest variants. That is, natural selection of those rare individuals that
fortuitously express the traits that complement or thwart the contemporary selective
pressures or constraints. It’s a process replete with chance. Cancer is a clear example of such
a Darwinian system. Most mutational processes have biases at the DNA sequence level and
mutational spectra in cancer can reflect or implicate particular error-prone repair processes
or particular genotoxic exposures, e.g. cigarette carcinogens, UV light, and
chemotherapeutics2. Patterns of genetic instability in cancer (chromosomal or microsatellite)
may reflect prior exposure and selective pressure exerted by particular classes of chemical
carcinogens2. Nevertheless, with respect to functions encoded in genes, mutagenic processes
are essentially blind or non-purposeful. (Intrinsic mutagenic or recombinatorial enzymes
preferentially targeting lymphoid Ig or TCR genes are the exception to this
generalisation12). What we see as recurrent, adaptive mutations endowing fitness traits in
cancer reflect the potent impact of clonal selection.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Clonal evolution involves the interplay of selectively advantageous or ‘driver’ lesions,
selectively neutral or ‘passenger’ lesions, and deleterious lesions, as well as lesions that
increase the rate of other genetic changes (‘mutator’ lesions)13,14, and changes to the microenvironment15 that change the fitness effects of those lesions. (Note that a “hitchhiker”
mutation in evolutionary biology is equivalent to a “passenger” mutation in cancer biology.)
‘Driver’ candidature is supported by independent observation in multiple neoplasm beyond
what would be expected by the background mutation rate, association with clonal
expansions16,17, and type of mutation (missense, nonsense, frame shift, splice-site,
phosphorylation sites, double deletions18, etc.)19,20, particularly if the gene involved has a
known role in cellular processes relevant to oncogenesis. Evidence for the importance of a
mutation in carcinogenesis from genetic studies of human tumours should be corroborated
with functional tests and animal models. ‘Passenger’ status may also be ambiguous or
context-dependent as, for example, with mono-allelic loss that only impacts on function
when the second allele is lost, mutations that only generate a phenotypic effect when another
locus mutates, or with mutants that only have selective potency in the face of particular
therapeutic challenges.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

There has been little work attempting to quantify the selective advantage conferred by driver
mutations. Using a non-spatial population genetics model of sequential, exponential clonal
expansions, Bozic et al. derived a formula for the proportion of expected neutral passenger
mutations versus selectively advantageous driver mutations as a function of the selective
advantage of the driver mutations. Fitting this equation to both glioblastoma and pancreatic
cancer resequencing data, they estimated that driver mutations confer an average fitness
advantage of only 0.4%21. Direct measurements of the selective advantage of a mutant clone
would require longitudinal samples of a neoplasm and estimation of the clone sizes at each
time point.
The dynamics of somatic evolution depend crucially on the interaction of rates of mutation
and clonal expansion. Mutation rates vary substantially for different genomic regions22 and
for different types of abnormalities, e.g. single base sequence changes versus balanced
chromosomal rearrangements and gene fusions, and will be greatly enhanced by the
instigation of genetic instability23–25. The rate of epigenetic changes has been estimated to
be orders of magnitude higher than genetic changes26 and could be a major determinant of
clonal evolution. Natural selection acts on epigenetic variation within neoplasms27 as well
as genetic variation, because epigenetic changes are heritable at cell division and can affect
cell phenotypes. Evolutionary biology has generated tools for addressing many of these
mutation rate complexities (see Supplementary Information for references) but these remain
under-utilised in cancer biology28. The traditional model of clonal evolution posits a series
of clonal expansions that grow to dominate the neoplasm (‘selective sweeps’)16,21,29.

However, this can only occur if the time until the next driver mutation is longer than the
time required for a clone to sweep through the neoplasm. Also, if the second mutation
occurs in a competitor clone, then the expansion of both clones is restrained by mutual
competition (called ‘clonal interference’)30. Given the large population sizes and high
mutation rates typical of neoplasms, clonal competition may be common31–33. Serial
sampling is the appropriate way to assess this issue and limited data suggests that parallel
clonal expansions may precede dominance of sub-clones early in cancer development34,35.
Initial evidence also suggests that large clonal expansions after transformation may be
rare26. Selective sweeps are predicted to originate from pre-existing genetic variants or subclones. Direct evidence for this comes from serial sampling of oncogenic mutations in
advanced disease36 or metastasis37 and, similarly, in post-chemotherapy relapses with
oncogenic mutations or with mutations in the drug target itself (see Supplementary
information for references).
Punctuated equilibrium versus gradualism

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A longstanding debate in species evolution pitting gradualism versus punctuated
equilibrium38 has recently emerged in considerations of clonal evolution of neoplasms. Do
malignant clones, with their dramatically altered genomes, evolve gradually through a
sequence of many genetic alterations and clonal expansions, or are there few, large scale
punctuated changes, possibly prompted by acute insult, a single, catastrophic mitosis that
generates multiple lesions across the genome or on a single chromosome (chromothripsis)39,
or through the accumulation of many lesions over time in a rare, undetected subclone?
Evidence of 10’s of non-synonymous mutations in cancers was interpreted as the result of
10’s of clonal expansions29. Reconstruction of genealogies of neoplastic clones, based on
genetic heterogeneity within neoplasms, suggests that clones with ancestral genomes are not
driven extinct by later clonal expansions31–33. This allows for reconstruction of the history
of a neoplasm. Data in breast cancer32 show that clones with intermediate genotypes are
difficult to detect and that each clone generates a cloud of genetic variants around it, which
may either be neutral or non-viable sub-clones. Work in B-cell chronic lymphocytic
leukemia40 suggests that intermediate clones can be detected but at a frequency of < 0.001,
which was below the detection threshold of the breast cancer study32. Those rare
intermediate clones may be rare because they had limited potential to expand or they may
have once been common but lost in competition to more recent clones.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Long periods of stasis of cancer clones are clearly implied by the frequency of premalignant clonal lesions (or CIS) that substantially exceed clinical cancer rates7–9 by cancer
dormancy41 and by genetic reconstitution of clonal histories37. But cancer clone evolution
probably passes a point of no return, perhaps at the juncture of metastatic growth. If
unlimited proliferative capacity is guaranteed by telomere stabilization25 then clonal
expansion may be curtailed only by the resultant morbidity and lifespan of the patient. And,
rather dramatically, when provided (albeit rarely) with the requisite routes of dissemination
and immuno-selection, cancer cells are capable of parasite-like immortality and
reestablishment in other individuals6,42,43.

The cancer ecosystem
Cancer clone genetic diversification and sub-clonal selection occurs within tissue
ecosystems, the latter providing both the venue and the determinants of fitness selection, i.e.
the adaptive landscape44. Tissue micro-environments are themselves complex, dynamic
states with multiple components that can influence cancer clone evolution (Fig. 1). TGFβ is
one instructive example of a cancer ecosystem regulatory molecule45. Other components of
inflammatory lesions are potent and common modulators of cancer cell ecosystems25.

Nature. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 July 19.

Greaves and Maley

Page 5

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Interactions between cancer cells and their tissue habitats are reciprocal and not infrequently
cancer cells remodel tissue micro-environments and specialised niches to their competitive
advantage46. Architectural constraints or barriers, such as sequestration of stem cells into
crypts in the gastrointestinal tract47, as well as the requirement for external signals for
proliferation and cell survival, impose restraints on cancer clone expansion. However, other
inducible components of the micro-environment can have a positive or promotional impact
on neoplastic cells, for example infiltrating macrophages and neo-vascularisation in
response to anoxia may support neoplastic cell survival and proliferation. As endorsed by
mathematical modelling, cancer clone evolutionary selection for more robust or malignant
phenotype is less likely in more stable or homogeneous micro-environments48. Spatial
heterogeneity of resources selects for cell migration and emigration from the primary
tumour, which may explain why there is selection for metasasis49. Pre-clinical models
suggest that normalizing the resources across the primary tumour can suppress metastasis50.
As cancer clones and sub-clones expand, migrant cells invade novel habitats or territories
within and between tissues, and so experience novel selective pressures that can cause
further diversification of the cancer cells. It is this malignant feature and its associated
morbidity that characterises end stage, clinically intransigent cancer.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Tissue ecosystems, serving as cancer cell habitats, are not closed systems. In addition to
their dynamic regulation by systemic factors (nutrients, hormones) or invasion by
inflammatory or endothelial cells, they can be modified by external exposures. In effect, the
relevant ecosystem for each cancer includes not only the tissue sites of residence but the
environment, lifestyle and associated aetiological exposures of the patient. Genotoxic
exposures (e.g. smoking, UV light), infection and chronic dietary/exercise habits impacting
on calorie or hormonal levels can have a profound impact on tissue micro-environments as
well as directly on cancer cells themselves (Fig. 1). Indeed it is in this context that many
exposures are aetiologically linked to initiation or promotion of disease. We assume that
without such modulating exposures, the risk of cancer clone initiation and evolution would
be much reduced.
The landscape of tissue ecosystems of cancer can also be radically altered following toxic
chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Wholesale clearance may decimate most cancer cells but the
remodelled landscapes that result then provide novel selective pressures, as well as new
resources and opportunities, for the emergence of any pre-existing variant cancer cells that
were able to survive therapy. Additionally, and possibly critically, stroma or specialized
habitat niches may protect cancer cells from therapy51.

Cancer genomics and clonal architectures
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Sequencing of cancer genomes, facilitated by the advent of second generation whole
genome sequencing, has opened a new window to the complexity of cancer cell genetics and
its evolutionary biology2. Since both transformation and metastases are probably clonal in
most cases2, deriving from single cells, identification of mutations present in all cells of a
tumour can reconstruct the genotype of the founder cell. These founder events constrain the
genetic and clonal complexity of tumors. We already had a long list of recurrent driver
mutations (with gain or loss of function) via the fine mapping of chromosome breaks,
candidate gene sequencing and functional screening of bulk samples from tumors. What has
now emerged in genomic screens is a portrait of just how complex cancer genomes usually
are. Individual cancers can contain hundreds or hundreds of thousands of mutations and
chromosomal alterations2, the great majority of which are assumed to be neutral mutations
arising via genetic instability. Chromosomal instability (amplifications, deletions,
translocations and other structural changes) is a common feature of most cancers, however it
is not clear if the rate of point mutations is increased in cancer2,21,23,52. Evolutionarily

neutral alterations presumably register in the screens as the result of hitchhiking on clonal
expansions driven by selectively advantageous alterations or by drift. Additionally, the data
vividly confirms that each cancer in each patient has an individually unique genomic profile.
It may be that only a modest number of phenotypic traits are required to negotiate all
constraints and evolve to full malignant or metastatic status25 but the inference is that this
can be achieved by an almost infinite variety of evolutionary trajectories and with multiple,
different combinations of driver mutations44.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Paradoxically, genome profiles under-estimate complexity. They are mostly, to date, one-off
snapshots taken from a single sample at a single diagnostic time point. Serial or parallel
sampling we know, via more conventional genetic analysis, uncovers genetic diversity.
Whole genome sequencing of paired primary tumour versus metastasis samples has been
limited to date but has revealed that individual metastatic lesions are clonal in origin and
genetically unique yet with clonal ancestries traceable back to the primary tumour2.
Descriptions of “the genome” of a cancer are perhaps misleading in one other respect.
Genetic variants are commonly identified in 5%–50% of reads, suggestingsub-clonal
distribution of most mutations53. But, critically, the pattern of segregation of mutations
within sub-clones is lost when DNA is extracted from the total cell population. This feature
is important if patient-specific genomic profiles are to provide a platform for selecting
therapeutic targets. Sub-clonal genetic diversity is arguably a key determinant of therapeutic
failure. This limitation in cancer genomicsis broadly recognised and represents a
considerable challenge, technically and bioinformatically. Understanding the genetic
diversity within neoplasms, and how it changes in response to interventions, will require
deep sequencing40 and interrogation of the genomes of single cells for patterns of
segregation of mutations.
Sub-clonal segregation of mutations and clonal architecture

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The classical model of clonal evolution, derived from Nowell3 envisages, sequential
acquisition of mutations with concomitant, successive sub-clonal dominance or ‘selective
sweeps’. Histopathological, time-ordered correlates of disease progression, i.e. adenoma,
carcinoma, metastases, encourage this view. At all stages of this evolution, however,
individual cells and their progeny (i.e., subclones) are vying for space and other limiting
resources. Multiplexed, single cell mutational analysis (ideally in serial samples) is the
appropriate way to interrogate clonal architecture. There are only a few examples of this to
date10,32,33 though they do provide evidence for complex patterns of sub-clonal segregation
of mutations, consistent with Nowell’s model. Collectively, a large body of data from tissue
section, small biopsy and the more recent single cell analyses33 testifies to the fact that the
evolutionary trajectories that emerge are complex and branching, exactly as envisioned by
Nowell, providing a striking parallel with Charles Darwin’s iconic evolutionary speciation
tree (Fig. 2). Attempts to shoehorn this complexity into a simple linear sequence of
mutational events, based on cross-sectional data, have probably been misleading54.
However, through a comparison of mutational genomes of sub-clones, it is possible to infer
their evolutionary or ancestral relationships as well as the order of events during the
development of that neoplasm32,33,37,53,54 (Fig. 4B). Clonal evolution from common
ancestral cancer cells is vividly illustrated in identical twin children with concordant acute
leukaemia55,56, in metastatic lesions2,10 and, by inference, in some cases of bilateral
testicular cancer57 (Fig. 3). Divergent cancer clone genotypes and phenotypes in this context
parallel allopatric speciation in separated natural habitats – as with finches in different
Galapagos Islands58.
Profiling of sub-clones within a neoplasm allows the inference of molecular clocks to time
events in histories of neoplasms. DNA methylation changes and point mutations have been
used to infer clonal expansion dynamics26, the time between initiation, invasion, and

metastasis17,37,52 and even the relative timing of events during progression, based on deep
sequencing data from a single sample59.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Sub-clones may be topographically mixed in the primary tissue37,60 but given their single
cell origin and bifurcating pathways, it is not surprising that they can also occupy distinctive
territories35,37,61,62 (Fig. 4A). This intra-tumour diversity can also be seen in cellular
phenotypes that have therapeutic relevance63. The fact that cancer clone evolution involves
contemporaneous sub-clones with distinctive mutational profiles, and that may be
territorially segregated, has considerable practical implications for biopsy-based diagnosis
and prognosis as well as for targeted therapy. Whether all sub-clonal diversification reflects
the impact of ‘driver’ mutations and selective advantage or additionally reflects some degree
of genetic drift, of selectively neutral mutations, or even epigenetic alterations remains
unclear. Sub-clonal structure can be quantified by diversity measures35,64,65, which have
been shown to be robust biomarkers for predicting progression to malignancy in Barrett’s
esophagus65 and are associated with tumor stage and subtype in breast cancer64.

Units of selection and cancer stem cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Evolutionary theory posits that natural selection operates in any system that has components
with varying reproductive potential4. In the evolutionary progression of cancer or its
resurgence post-therapy, the primary unit of selection is the cell. Not any cell but rather a
cell that has extensive replicative potential. This equates to the so-called cancer stem cell
(a.k.a. cancer initiating or propagating cell) (Fig. 5).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis was developed via transplantation experiments with
leukemic cells and although promulgated as a general feature of all cancers, it has proven
contentious66. There has been no consensus view on whether CSCs are rare or high
frequency cells or whether they have fixed, hierarchical or variable phenotypic properties. A
consideration of evolutionary progression in cancer suggests that cells with extensive
propagating activity are unlikely to be fixed entities67. As cellular drivers of sub-clonal
expansion, they are more likely to vary in frequency and phenotypic features. The only
obligatory feature they must possess is the potential for extensive self-renewal (Fig. 5). In
this respect the clinical relevance of CSCs is endorsed by the finding that quantitative
measures of stem cell activity or self-renewal (via xenotransplantation or gene expression
signatures) are predictive of clinical outcome in several cancer types68. Self-renewal will be
underpinned by aberrant genotype and possibly by other epigenetic features. Several testable
predictions follow from this. First, CSCs are highly likely to evolve and change in genotype
and phenotype as each cancer evolves pre-and post-therapy67,69,70. Some therapies may
even provide strong selection for CSC survival and proliferation71. Second, there may be
selective pressure, during cancer progression, for cells with the most extensive self-renewing
capacity – at the expense of cells with intact differentiation competence. This has been
observed in CML72 and mouse models73,74. A higher probability of symmetrical selfrenewing proliferative cycles would be expected to result in an increase in numbers and
frequency of CSCs72. It is therefore of some consequence that loss of the p53 DNA damage
checkpoint, a highly frequent correlate of cancer progression and clinical intransigence75
appears to ‘release’ stem cell-like transcriptional signatures76 and leads to enhanced selfrenewal, in mammosphere culture systems77. The frequency of CSCs could then evolve
from low to very high frequency with progression of disease78,79. Third, for selection to
operate via micro-environmental or therapeutic pressures, there should be contemporaneous
genetic variation in CSCs. This has been born out in leukemias80,81. These considerations
have significant clinical implications. Clearly, whatever the frequency and phenotype, if
self-renewing CSCs drive and sustain cancer clonal evolution then they are the repository of
all functionally relevant mutational events underpinning clonal selection pre-and post-

therapy. This then reinforces the view that their restraint or elimination should be the
ultimate target of any therapy. But if they are genetically (and epigenetically) diverse, as
evolutionary considerations and initial experiments80,81 clearly imply, then a basis for
therapeutic failure is immediately apparent. In fact, the expansion of resistant clones under
therapy shows that the therapy was able to differentially eliminate CSCs lacking the
resistance lesion (see Supplemental information). The adaptability of CSCs afforded by
genetic diversity is compounded by what appears to be their intrinsically lowered
susceptibility to drugs and irradiation82. This may be the consequence of stromal cell
associations83 and quiescence (of CSC sub-populations) along with associated properties of
enhanced DNA repair and elevated expression of drug efflux pumps, possibly all evolved
contingencies to protect vital normal stem cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Sub-clonal genetic heterogeneity is a common, if not universal, feature of cancers84 but it
cannot be assumed that all sub-clones are sustained by CSCs; some could be evolutionary
dead-ends generated by cells with only limited propagating potential. It is partly to
accommodate this fact that the in vivo assay for CSCs involves sequential transplants66.
Ideally, the genomes of single CSCs would be interrogated. The issue of genetic
heterogeneity can be effectively addressed by comparing sub-clonal diversity or clonal
architecture pre- and post-transplant. In one experiment, quadrant sections of glioblastoma
were shown to have divergent but related genotypes, but all contained cells reading out in
the in vivo (intra-cerebral) CSC assay85. More definitive data comes from a comparison of
sub-clonal genetic profiles pre-and post-transplant that were interrogated at the single cell
level and/or by SNP arrays in B cell precursor ALL. Multiple sub-clones from each patient’s
diagnostic sample registered in the in vivo CSC transplant assays albeit with variable
competitive potency33,66,80,81. We await experimental confirmation of the prediction that
such genetic diversity of CSCs is a common feature of cancer but, assuming it is, then some
important therapeutic implications follow.

Cancer escape: need for a Darwinian bypass?
‘More research should be directed towards understanding and controlling the
evolutionary process in tumours before it reaches the late stage seen in clinical
cancer.’
P Nowell, 1976

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cancer therapeutics has had its successes but the reality remains that very few advanced or
metastatic malignancies are amenable to effective control or eradication. Genetic variation
in CSCs, particularly if fermented by genetic instability, provides the substrate for selective
escape. In addition, other mechanisms of positive selection by therapy exist that are nongenetic; these can involve signalling plasticity (or oncogene bypass)86, quiescence87 or
epigenetic changes88, though many of these may depend on heritable and thus selectable
epigenetic variation. There has been great expectation that the audit of cancer genomes, by
identifying recurrent and drug able mutations, will herald in a new phase of highly specific
or targeted small molecule inhibitors and personalised medicine89. Oncogene addiction
appeared to be the Achilles heel for cancer in this respect90. The success of imatinib and
derivative ABL kinase inhibitors in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML)90 was encouraging.
But CML is an atypical cancer. It is essentially a pre-malignant (albeit ultimately lethal)
condition driven, most probably, by a single founder mutation (BCR-ABL1 fusion), which
provides a universal target. Even in this most favourable of circumstances, escape occurs
either via quiescence (and coupled resistance) of CSC91 or via mutation of the ABL kinase
target. Once CML evolves to overt malignancy or blast crisis, with more genetic complexity,
ABL1 kinase-directed therapy is often ineffective.

Other specific small molecule inhibitors directed at mutant products produce initially
encouraging results in patients with advanced disease but the benefits have turned out to be
transitory as cancer clones re-emerge with resistant features. When targets selected are nonfounder mutations, even if they dominate the neoplasm, therapy can be anticipated to select
for sub-clones lacking the mutant target70. Alternatively, sub-clones may have additional
mutations that enable signalling bypass of the drug target, as with MET amplification in
EGFR mutant lung cancer treated with EGFR kinase inhibitors92.
What is a way out of this impasse? Champions of targeted therapy and personalised
medicine argue that the problem can be solved by artful combinations of drugs targeting
components of networked signalling and tailored to the individual patient’s cancer genome.
Synthetic lethal strategies hold promise in this regard93.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Self-renewing cancer cells are the ultimate target so the development of high throughput
screening for selective inhibitors is encouraging71. Targeting components of the selfrenewing programme itself (independent of specific mutant genotype) deserve exploration,
especially if a distinction can be made with normal adult stem cells (see Supplemental
information). The problem of intrinsically resistant (and quiescent?) stem cells, in the case
of CML, has been addressed by combining selective kinase (ABL1) inhibitors with
inhibitors for histone deacetylase94 or BCL695. But ultimately it may prove difficult to
thwart the plasticity or adaptability of cancer cells (or CSC) that is an inherent evolutionary
feature of advanced disease. A Darwinian bypass may be required. A clear implication of
cancer’s evolutionary diversity is that prevention (e.g. cessation of smoking, avoidance of
sunburn, prophylactic vaccines, etc) makes a great deal of sense as does early detection and
intervention, i.e. prior to extensive genetic diversification and dissemination.
An alternative therapeutic strategy directs attention away from the cancer cells and towards
their micro-environmental habitats. There are many opportunities here for so-called
‘ecological’ therapy, directed at changing the essential habitat and dependencies of cancer
cells96. Anti-angiogenesis is a prime example of this tactic and may provide a potent
restraint on CSCs97. Other examples include interference with bone remodelling with
bisphosphonates in prostate cancer, aromatase inhibitors in breast cancer, exploiting
hypoxia, inhibitors of inflammation or tumour infiltrating macrophages and blockage of
CSC interactions with essential stromal or niche components96,98.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A further alternative is to seek to control cancer, rather than eradicate it, turning cancer into
a chronic disease. Since the speed of evolution is proportional to the fitness differential
between cells, cytotoxic drugs are predicted to rapidly select for resistance5. They likely
cause competitive release99, by removing all the competitors of the resistant cells. In
contrast, cytostatic drugs should delay progression and mortality longer than cytotoxic
drugs, because sensitive competitor cells remain to occupy space and consume resources
that would otherwise benefit the resistant clones. In addition, by suppressing cell division,
cytostatic drugs also suppress the opportunities for new mutations. Intriguingly, Gate by and
colleagues have recently shown that by treating an aggressive ovarian cancer (OVCAR-3)
xenograft tumour to maintain a stable size, rather than eradicate it, they were able to keep
the host mice alive indefinitely. Moreover, the dose of carboplatin necessary to keep the
tumour in check declined over time100. We should be asking what phenotypes can we select
for that would make neoplasm less deadly and more clinically manageable?
The evolutionary theory of cancer has survived 35 years of empirical observation and testing
and so may be considered a bona fide scientific theory today. While the basic components of
somatic evolution are well understood, the dynamics of somatic evolution remain largely
opaque. Fortunately, there are tools from evolutionary biology that may be applied to

neoplasms in order to address many of the fundamental questions in cancer biology, such as
the order of events in progression, distinguishing driver mutations from passengers, as well
as understanding and preventing therapeutic resistance. The dynamics of clonal
diversification and selection are critical to understanding neoplastic progression and
response to therapy. There are exciting clinical opportunities in directly addressing the
evolutionary adaptability of neoplasms and designing interventions to slow, direct or
otherwise control that evolution so as to delay or prevent cancer mortality.

Divergent (branching) clonal evolution of cancer with topographical separation.
In each example, a clonal (single cell) ancestry is indicated by shared acquired mutations,
e.g. ETV6-RUNX1 fusion for the leukaemias, c-kit mutation for the testicular cancers. The
time at which the two subclones evolve (T1, T2) can be temporarily synchronous or develop
several years apart37,55–57. The probabilities of sub-clones emerging as shown are
independent and different (p1, p2). In most cases (90% for monozygotic twins), only one
twin develops overt leukaemia. The penetrance of bilateral testicular cancer having a
common origin57 is unknown.
