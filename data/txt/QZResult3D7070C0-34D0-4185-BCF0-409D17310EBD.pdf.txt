Abstract
Background: Whether metformin use may affect the risk of oral cancer required
further investigation.
Methods: The reimbursement database of the National Health Insurance in
Taiwan was used. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus at an onset age of 2574 years during 1999-2005 and newly treated with either metformin (n = 288198,
“ever users of metformin”) or other antidiabetic drugs (n = 16263, “never users
of metformin”) were followed for at least 6 months for oral cancer until December
31, 2011. The treatment effect of metformin (for ever versus never users, and for
tertiles of cumulative duration of therapy) was estimated by Cox regression adjusted
for propensity score (PS) or incorporated with the inverse probability of treatment
weighting (IPTW) using PS.
Results: The respective numbers of incident oral cancer in ever users and never
users were 1273 (0.44%) and 119 (0.73%), with respective incidences of 92.7 and
163.6 per 100,000 person-years. The overall hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals)
suggested a significantly lower risk [0.584 (0.483-0.707) for PS-adjusted model, and
0.562 (0.465-0.678) for IPTW model]. In tertile analyses, the PS-adjusted hazard
ratios (95% confidence intervals) for the first (<21.5 months), second (21.5-45.9
months) and third (>45.9 months) tertile of cumulative duration were 1.403 (1.1521.708), 0.557 (0.453-0.684) and 0.152 (0.119-0.194), respectively; and were 1.244
(1.024-1.511), 0.526 (0.429-0.645) and 0.138 (0.108-0.176), respectively, for IPTW.
Conclusions: Metformin may significantly reduce the risk of oral cancer, especially
when the cumulative duration is more than 21.5 months.

Introduction

remains to be confirmed.
Some recent studies suggested that metformin may
inhibit the growth of human head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma in cancer cell lines [14]. However,
epidemiological studies evaluating the effect of metformin
on oral cancer are still rare. A recent meta-analysis [15]
suggested that only 3 studies are available from the
literature: 2 conducted in the USA evaluating the effect
of metformin on the survival of patients with head and
neck cancer [16, 17] and 1 from Taiwan comparing the
incidence of head and neck cancer in patients with diabetes
who used and did not use metformin [18]. Metformin users

Metformin exerts anticancer effects in various
cancer cell types including the breast [1], endometrium,
colon, thyroid and esophagus [2], pancreas [3, 4],
stomach [5] and prostate [6]. Epidemiological studies
also suggested that metformin use in patients with type 2
diabetes mellitus is associated with a reduced risk of colon
cancer [7], bladder cancer [8], breast cancer [9], prostate
cancer [10], thyroid cancer [11], endometrial cancer [12]
and ovarian cancer [13]. However, whether metformin use
can reduce the risk of oral cancer in patients with diabetes

in patients with diabetes were found to have a significantly
34% lower risk of head and neck cancer (adjusted hazard
ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.55-0.79) [18] and
its use was associated with an improvement in the overall
survival of patients with head and neck cancer [16,
17]. However, in the study conducted in Taiwan, when
head and neck cancer was subcategorized into several
categories, it was noted that the reduced risk of oral cancer
among metformin users was not statistically significant.
The adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) was
0.81 (0.63-1.03) [18].
Therefore, there is only one study investigating the
incidence of oral cancer with regards to metformin use
in patients with diabetes, which did not fully support a
beneficial effect of metformin [18]. Additionally, doseresponse relationship was not evaluated in this previous
study. The purpose of the present study was to further
evaluate whether metformin use in Taiwanese patients
with type 2 diabetes mellitus could be associated with the
risk of oral cancer by using the reimbursement databases
of the National Health Insurance (NHI). Specifically,
the present study tried to address the dose-response
relationship by using the tertile cutoffs of cumulative
duration of metformin therapy, and to investigate whether
the combination use with other antidiabetic drugs would
affect the results. Furthermore, to solve the potential
problem of “prevalent user bias” [19, 20], newly diagnosed
diabetic patients and incident users of metformin were
recruited. To reduce the potential risk of “immortal time
bias” (the initial period of follow-up during which the
outcome can not occur) [19, 21], patients included into
the study should have been prescribed antidiabetic drugs

for at least two times, and those who were followed for
a short period of time (i.e., <180 days) were excluded
from analyses. To avoid the potential confounding from
the differences in baseline characteristics associated with
treatment allocation in non-random observational studies,
Cox regression models were created either adjusted for
propensity score (PS) or incorporated with the inverse
probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using PS
[22]. Analyses were conducted both in an original sample
derived from the NHI database and in a matched-pair
sample derived from the original sample to examine the
consistency of the findings.

Results
There were 16263 never users and 288198 ever
users in the original sample (Figure 1). In the original
sample, all baseline characteristics (defined at the start
of follow-up) of the two groups differed significantly,
except for pioglitazone. Ever users were characterized by
younger age, less males, higher proportions of eye disease,
dyslipidemia, peripheral arterial disease and tobacco
abuse, lower proportions of hypertension, nephropathy,
stroke, ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and alcohol-related diagnoses, higher
proportions of use of rosiglitazone, statin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs excluding aspirin, but
lower proportions of using other antidiabetic medications,
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin
receptor blocker and aspirin (Table 1). It is evident that
the baseline characteristics between never users and
ever users of metformin were more comparable in the

matched sample. Only 5 variables remained significantly
different between the two groups, i.e., age, eye disease,
sulfonylurea, acarbose and insulin. While examining the
standardized differences, 10 out of the 22 variables had
values >10% in the original sample, but only sulfonylurea
and insulin had values >10% in the matched sample.
Actually when covariates were defined at the time of
censor, only insulin would have a standardized difference
>10% (i.e., -10.41, data for other baseline characteristics
are not shown). These findings suggested that results
derived from the matched sample would be less likely
influenced by residual confounding from the differences

metformin exposure in the original sample and the hazard

patients in the original sample and the matched sample,
respectively. Only models derived from covariates defined
at the start of follow-up are shown in Table 2. The results
derived from models with covariates defined at censor are
basically similar to the respective models shown in Table 2

92.7 and 163.6 per 100,000 person-years (Table 2). When
evaluating the distribution of the incident cases of oral
cancer by the tertiles of cumulative duration of metformin
therapy, there was a trend of decreasing incidence with
longer duration of exposure (Table 2). The overall hazard
ratios (95% confidence intervals) showed a significantly
lower risk of oral cancer associated with metformin use
in both the PS-adjusted and the IPTW models in either the
original sample or the matched sample. When analyzed by
the tertiles of cumulative duration of metformin therapy, a
reduced risk was observed for the second and third tertiles
in all models. A significantly increased risk was observed
for the first tertile in the original sample, but the risk was
neutral in the first tertile when the matched sample was
analyzed.
Table 3 shows the hazard ratios for oral cancer
comparing different subgroups of metformin exposure
with and without other antidiabetic drugs to a referent
group who had never used metformin. It was noted that
while compared to never users of metformin, metformin
users with or without the use of other antidiabetic drugs
consistently showed a lower risk of oral cancer in all
models. Patients who used only metformin seemed to have
a much lower risk than those who might also have been
using other antidiabetic drugs.

Several randomized clinical trials are being
conducted to evaluate the potential usefulness of
metformin together with other chemotherapeutic agents on
some solid cancers like the breast, endometrial, prostate,
and lung cancer [24]. However, clinical trial focusing
specifically on the investigation of the effect of metfomin
on oral cancer is still lacking. This study provided an
important clue for an in-depth investigation of metformin
on the prevention and treatment of oral cancer.
In the previous study by Yen et al., a significantly
34% lower risk of head and neck cancer was observed in
the diabetic patients who used metformin [18]. However,
they did not observe a significantly reduced risk of
oral cancer associated with metformin use when some
categories of site-specific head and neck cancer were
evaluated [18]. Despite a lack of statistical significance,
the adjusted hazard ratio of 0.81 (95% confidence interval:
0.63-1.03) still favored a lower risk of oral cancer in
metformin users [18]. Some reasons might explain the
lack of statistical significance in the study by Yen et al.
[18]. First, the sample sizes of metformin users and cases
of oral cancer were much smaller in this previous study
and this could lead to a lack of statistical power. Second,
as noted in the present study, the risk of oral cancer was
actually increased in the first tertile of cumulative duration
of metformin therapy of less than 21.5 months in the
original sample (Table 2). If the previous study included
more metformin users with a short duration of use and
did not consider the potential imbalance in baseline
characteristics between metformin users and non-users,
the estimated hazard ratio might be substantially biased
toward the null. Third, the lack of investigating a doseresponse relationship might have concealed much of the
information in the previous study.
The significantly higher risk of oral cancer observed
in the first tertile of cumulative duration of metformin
therapy in the original sample (Table 2) might be due
to residual confounding from the different baseline
characteristics between metformin ever users and never
users (Table 1), because this was no more observed in the
analyses of the more balanced matched sample (Table 2).
Additionally, early users of metformin might have a higher
risk of oral cancer which was carried over from the diet
control/lifestyle modification period to the early phase of
metformin therapy.
Oral cancer is closely associated with smoking,
alcohol drinking and betel nut chewing [25, 26]. Due to
the lack of such information in the databases, we could
only use surrogate diagnoses of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, tobacco abuse and alcohol-related
diagnoses for adjustment. Because betel nut chewing is
highly correlated with smoking [27, 28], adjustment for
surrogate diagnoses for smoking might also have partially
adjusted for the effect of betel nut chewing. Although
analyses of the standardized differences did not suggest
potential confounding from these variables in either the

Discussion
The findings of this observational study suggested
that metformin use in patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus was associated with a significantly lower risk
of oral cancer. This was not only observed in the overall
analyses comparing ever users to never users, but also
in the second and third tertiles of cumulative duration
of metformin therapy (Table 2). Although a significantly
higher risk was observed in patients who used metformin
for less than 21.5 months in the first tertile in the original
sample, this was no more observed in the analyses of the
matched sample (Table 2). The combination use of other
antidiabetic drugs might slightly attenuate the protective
effect of metformin, but this did not totally abrogate the
metformin effect either when it was used as an initial
treatment or as an add-on to other oral antidiabetic drugs
or to insulin (Table 3).
The present study added to the literature by
showing a dose-response risk reduction of oral cancer
among metformin users (Table 2). Because oral cancer
is increasing dramatically in the general population in
many countries including Taiwan [23] and diabetes is in
an epidemic status all over the world, this study not only
provided evidence for the use of metformin as a first-line
antidiabetic treatment in terms of oral cancer prevention,
its use as an adjuvant anticancer treatment to oral cancer
is worthy of further investigation, taking into account the
improvement of overall survival among metformin users
with head and neck cancer [16, 17].

metformin exposed to unexposed patients in the original sample and the matched sample

original sample or the matched sample (Table 1), residual
confounding could not be excluded because none of these
lifestyle risk factors had been actually measured. On the
other hand, a confounder should theoretically be correlated
with both the exposure (metformin use) and the outcome
(oral cancer), and it should not be an intermediate between
exposure and outcome [29], there is little reason to believe
that these factors can be determinants for metformin use.
Taken together, the residual confounding from these
lifestyle factors might be minimal.
Human papillomavirus has also been identified as
an important risk factor of oral cancer [30], especially in
women [31]. Because we did not have such information
for analysis, it was not possible to exclude the confounding
effect of this viral infection.
The use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/
angiotensin receptor blocker [32], statin [33], aspirin [34]
and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [34] have been
shown to affect cancer risk in some studies and they are
commonly used in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Although metformin never users and ever users might
have different probability of using these drugs in the
original sample (Table 1), they did not exert important
confounding on the protective effect of metformin on oral
cancer based on the following reasons. First, they have
been adjusted for as potential confounders in all analyses
(Tables 2 and 3) and the standardized differences did not
suggest potential confounding from these covariates in
the original sample (Table 1). Second, these variables did
not distribute differently between metformin never users
and ever users in the matched sample (Table 1), and the
analyses in the matched sample gave similar conclusion
(Table 2).
The mechanisms for a reduced risk of oral cancer
associated with metformin use remains to be explored.
Chronic inflammation has been increasingly recognized as
a key component of tumor progression in the oral cavity
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[35]. Patients with diabetes suffer from a significantly
higher risk of periodontitis [36, 37], and thus may have
a higher risk of oral cancer [23]. Metformin use may
reduce inflammation in patients with diabetes either
through the improvement of metabolic disturbances such
as hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia
or through its inhibition of the proinflammatory cancerpromoting nuclear factor κB and STAT3 pathways [38,
39]. Additionally, metformin may inhibit tumorigenesis
by inhibiting mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
through the activation of 5’-adenosine monophosphateactivated protein kinase (AMPK) [38]. Recent studies also
suggested that metformin may exert an immune-mediated
antitumor effect by increasing the number of CD8+ tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes [40], and suppress the growth
of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines via
global inhibition of protein translation [14]. Metformin
impairs one-carbon metabolism and acts like an antifolate
drug [41], and suppresses viral replication in hepatitis B
[42] and C [43] infection (though whether similar effect
can be observed in human papillomavirus infection is
not known). Therefore, potential mechanisms linking
a reduced risk of oral cancer with the use of metformin
may be through its improvement of metabolic parameters,
inhibition of chronic inflammation, suppression of
mTOR via AMPK activation, modulation of immunity,
inhibition of protein translation, impairment of one-carbon
metabolism and suppression of viral replication.
This study has several strengths. The databases
included all claims records on outpatient visits, emergency
department visits and hospital admission, and we caught
the diagnoses from all sources. Cancer is considered
a severe morbidity by the NHI and most medical copayments can be waived. Furthermore, there is a low
drug cost-sharing required by the NHI and patients with
certain conditions, such as those with a low-income
household, veterans or patients with prescription refills
2004

Oncotarget

Table 3: Hazard ratios for oral cancer in different subgroups of metformin exposure with or without other antidiabetic
drugs in comparison to a referent group who had never used metformin in the original sample

for chronic disease, are exempted from the drug costsharing. Therefore the detection rate of oral cancer would
not tend to differ among different social classes. The use
of medical records also reduced the potential bias related
to self-reporting.
The study limitations included a lack of actual
measurement data for confounders such as smoking,
alcohol drinking, betel nut chewing, family history,
lifestyle, diet, and genetic parameters. In addition, we
did not have biochemical data to evaluate their impact.
Another limitation is the lack of information on the
pathology, grading and staging of oral cancer. Because
squamous cell carcinoma represents approximately 95%
of all cases of oral cancer in Taiwan [44], the findings of
the present study should better be applied to squamous
cell carcinoma.
In summary, this study is probably the first to show
that metformin use among Taiwanese patients with type 2
diabetes mellitus may significantly reduce the risk of oral
cancer, especially when it has been used for more than 21.5
months. This protective effect of metformin is not affected
by the use of other antidiabetic drugs and is independent
of some medications that may affect cancer risk, such
as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin
receptor blocker, statin, aspirin and non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs. However, future confirmation with
appropriate consideration of potential confounders such as
smoking, alcohol drinking, betel nut chewing and human
papillomavirus infection is mandatory.

has contracts with >98% of the hospitals nationwide.
Computerized and standard claim documents must be
submitted to the Bureau of NHI for reimbursement by the
contracted medical institutes.
The NHI reimbursement databases have been
handled by the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI)
and can be used for academic researches if approved by an
ethical review board and the NHRI. The databases contain
detailed records of every visit of each patient (including
outpatient visits, emergency department visits and hospital
admission) and include principal and secondary diagnostic
codes, prescription orders, and claimed expenses. This
study was approved with an approval number 99274.
Individual identification information was scrambled
for the protection of privacy. Diabetes was coded 250.XX
and oral cancer 140, 141, 143, 144, 145, 146, 148, and

Figure 1 shows the procedures in recruiting a cohort
of patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus
at an onset age of 25-74 years during the period from
1999 to 2005 into the study (original sample). To assure
that diabetes was first diagnosed after 1999, patients who
had a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus during 1996-1998
were excluded. Patients should have been followed in the
outpatient clinic with prescription of antidiabetic drugs
for 2 or more times (n = 423949). In Taiwan, patients
with type 1 diabetes can be issued a so-called “Severe
Morbidity Card” after a certified diagnosis and they are
waived of much of the co-payment. Patients who held a
Severe Morbidity Card certifying they had type 1 diabetes
were also excluded (n = 2400). A total of 338 patients
were excluded because of missing data. Patients who had

been diagnosed as having any cancer before entry were
excluded (n = 44248). Patients aged <25 (n = 21089)
or >75 (n = 43336) were not included into the analyses.
Patients who had been followed up for <180 days (n =
8080) were also excluded.
Cumulative duration (months) of metformin use
was calculated from the reimbursement databases and
tertiles of cumulative duration were used for analyses.
Demographic data of age and sex and factors that might be
correlated with metformin use, diabetes severity or cancer
risk were considered as potential confounders [32-34, 4547]. These included 1) major comorbidities associated
with diabetes mellitus: hypertension (ICD-9-CM code:
401-405) and dyslipidemia (272.0-272.4); 2) diabetesrelated complications: nephropathy (580-589), eye disease
(250.5, 362.0, 369, 366.41 and 365.44), stroke (430438), ischemic heart disease (410-414), and peripheral
arterial disease (250.7, 785.4, 443.81 and 440-448); 3)
antidiabetic drugs: sulfonylurea, meglitinide, acarbose,
insulin, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone; 4) potential risk
factors of oral cancer: chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (a surrogate for smoking; 490-496), tobacco abuse
(305.1, 649.0, 989.84) and alcohol-related diagnoses (291,
303, 535.3, 571.0-571.3, 980.0); and 5) medications that
may affect cancer risk: angiotensin converting enzyme
inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker [32], statin [33],
aspirin [34] and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(excluding aspirin) [34]. Baseline characteristics defined
at the start of follow-up between never users and ever
users were compared by Student’s t test for age and by
Chi-square test for other variables. The accuracy of
disease diagnoses in the NHI database has been studied
previously. Agreements between claim data and medical
records are moderate to substantial, with Kappa values
ranged from 0.55 to 0.86 [48].
The incidence density of oral cancer was calculated
for never users and ever users and for different subgroups
of exposure to metformin. The numerator of the incidence
was the number of patients with incident oral cancer
during follow-up, and the denominator was the personyears of follow-up. Follow-up started on the first day of
the use of antidiabetic drugs and ended on December 31,
2011, at the time of a new diagnosis of oral cancer, or on
the date of death or the last reimbursement record.
Logistic regression was used to create PS from the
baseline characteristics as shown in Table 1. The treatment
effect was estimated either by Cox regression with
adjustment for PS (PS-adjusted models) or incorporated
with the inverse probability of treatment weighting
(IPTW models) using PS without trimming [22]. Hazard
ratios were estimated for ever versus never users, and for
each tertile of cumulative duration of metformin therapy
compared to never users as referent.
In consideration that the baseline characteristics
were imbalanced between metformin ever users and never
users, additional analyses were conducted by using a 1:1

matched-pair sample based on 8 digits of PS according
to the methods described by Parsons (matched sample)
[49]. Because the metformin ever users outnumbered
never users in the original sample, the case number for
each group in the matched sample was based on the case
number of never users in the original sample (i.e., n =
16263 in each group).
To further examine whether the use of other
antidiabetic drugs might exert an impact on the association
between metformin use and oral cancer risk, additional
analyses were conducted by categorizing metformin users
into different subgroups and hazard ratios were estimated
by using never users of metformin as the referent group.
In classification I, users of metformin were divided into: 1)
metformin only; 2) metformin as the first oral antidiabetic
drug with add-on of other oral antidiabetic drugs, but
without insulin; 3) metformin as add-on to other oral
antidiabetic drugs, but without insulin; and 4) metformin
with insulin (with or without other oral antidiabetic drugs).
In classification II, metformin users were divided into: 1)
metformin only; 2) metformin as the first oral antidiabetic
drug with add-on of other oral antidiabetic drugs and/
or insulin; and 3) metformin as add-on to other oral
antidiabetic drugs and/or insulin.
The covariates in the above analyses were defined
at the start of follow-up. To further examine whether the
findings might be consistent, all of the above models were
also conducted with the covariates defined during the
whole observation period until the time of censor.
Although IPTW approach has been used to obtain
unbiased estimates, this would not be valid if residual
systematic differences in baseline characteristics exist
[50]. Austin and Stuart proposed a quantitative method
as a formal test for balance diagnostics based on the
calculation of standardized difference [50]. Although no
consensus has been reached for the value of standardized
difference to indicate confounding, a value of >10% for
a variable might indicate meaningful imbalance with
potential confounding [50]. To examine whether residual
systematic differences in the covariates might exist, the
standardized differences for all covariates were calculated
for the IPTW models in the original sample and the
matched sample using the methods described by Austin
and Stuart [50].
Analyses were conducted using SAS statistical
software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
