BACKGROUND: It has not been well established whether genetic variations can be biomarkers for clinical outcome of
gemcitabine therapy. The purpose of this study was to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of gemcitabine metabolic and transporter genes that are associated with toxicity and efficacy of gemcitabine-based therapy in
patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. METHODS: The authors evaluated 17 SNPs of the CDA,dCK, DCTD,
RRM1, hCNT1-3, and hENT1 genes in 149 patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer who underwent gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy. The association of genotypes with neutropenia, tumor response to therapy, overall
survival, and progression-free survival (PFS) was analyzed by logistic regression, log-rank test, Kaplan-Meier plot,
and Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: The CDA A-76C, dCK C-1205T, RRM1 A33G, and hENT1 C913T
genotypes were significantly associated with grade 3 to 4 neutropenia (P ¼ .020, .015, .003, and .017, respectively).The CDA A-76C and hENT1 A-201G genotypes were significantly associated with tumor response to therapy (P ¼
.017 and P ¼ .019). A combined genotype effect of CDA A-76C, RRM1 A33G, RRM1 C-27A, and hENT1 A-201G on PFS
was observed. Patients carrying 0 to 1 (n ¼ 64), 2 (n ¼ 50), or 3 to 4 (n ¼ 17) at-risk genotypes had median PFS
times of 8.3, 6.0, and 4.2 months, respectively (P ¼ .002). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that some polymorphic variations of drug metabolic and transporter genes may be potential biomarkers for clinical outcome of gemciC 2010 American

Pancreatic cancer is the third most common gastrointestinal malignancy and the fourth leading cause of cancer
deaths in the United States.1 At diagnosis, only 20% of patients have a surgically resectable tumor, 30% have a locally
advanced tumor, and 50% present with distant metastasis.2 Over the past decade, gemcitabine (20 ,20 -difluorodeoxycytidine) has been the standard agent for first-line chemotherapy of advanced pancreatic cancer, producing limited clinical
benefit and improved overall survival (OS) as compared with 5-fluorouracil.3 Recent studies have reported the efficacy of
a combination therapy of gemcitabine plus radiation for unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer.4,5 However, factors that can predict tumor response and survival have not been well elucidated.6 In addition, although 1 major side effect
caused by gemcitabine is hematological toxicity such as neutropenia, available biomarkers for severe toxicity have not yet
been established.
Gemcitabine is a specific analogue of the native pyrimidine nucleotide deoxycytidine and a prodrug that requires cellular uptake and intracellular phosphorylation (Fig. 1).7-9 Gemcitabine intracellular uptake is mediated mainly by human
equilibrative nucleoside transporter (hENT1, also known as solute carrier family 29 A1) and, to a lesser extent, by human
concentrative nucleoside transporters (hCNT) 1 and hCNT3 (also known as solute carrier family 28 A1 or A3).9 Inside
cells, gemcitabine is phosphorylated to its monophosphate form by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), and this step is essential

the enzyme SNPs and gemcitabine toxicity.31-33 We have
previously shown that genetic variations in gemcitabine
metabolism and transport are associated with drug toxicity and OS in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer.34
In the current study, we tried to validate the previous findings in 149 patients with locally advanced pancreatic
cancer who had undergone gemcitabine-based therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

metabolite of gemcitabine; dFdU, 20 ,20 -difluorodeoxyuridine;

for further phosphorylation to its active triphosphate
form.10 The active diphosphate metabolite of gemcitabine
is also active and inhibits DNA synthesis indirectly by
inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase (RRM1).8,11,12
Gemcitabine is inactivated primarily by deoxycytidine
deaminase (CDA) into 20 ,20 -difluorodeoxyuridine, and
gemcitabine monophosphate is inactivated by deoxycytidylate deaminase (DCTD) into 20 ,20 -difluorodeoxyuridine, monophosphate form.8,9
Previous studies have demonstrated the relationship
between gemcitabine metabolic or transport enzymes and
clinical outcome. One study showed that low expression
of CDA was associated with severe hematologic toxicity of
gemcitabine.13 Other studies in cell lines or tumor tissues
have established the association between resistance to
gemcitabine and decreased nucleoside transport into
cells,14-16 decreased expression of activation enzymes such
as dCK,17-20 increased expression of degradation enzymes
such as CDA and DCTD,21,22 as well as increased expression of RRM1.23-26 In clinical studies of pancreatic
cancer, high expression of hENT1 in tumors has been
associated with improved survival in patients treated with
gemcitabine.15,16,23,27
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of
enzymes in gemcitabine’s pharmacologic pathway have
been previously identified.8 The activity of these enzymes
has been correlated with polymorphic gene variations by
in vivo and in vitro studies.9,28-30 However, only a few
clinical studies have shown a positive association between

Patient Recruitment and Data Collection
A single-institution retrospective analysis was completed.
We identified 149 patients with biopsy-confirmed locally
advanced pancreatic cancer at the time of diagnosis.
Locally advanced pancreatic cancer was defined as unresectable tumors that extended to the celiac axis or the
superior mesenteric artery or tumors that occluded the
superior mesenteric venous-portal venous confluence
based on a review of the computed tomography (CT).35
All patients were required to be treatment naive and
underwent gemcitabine-based chemotherapy as first-line
therapy as a single agent or in combination at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston,
Tex) from February 1999 to June 2007. The median dose
of gemcitabine therapy was 750 mg/m2 (range, 450-1000
mg/m2). In 75 (50.3%) patients, either cisplatin or
oxaliplatin was administered with gemcitabine. In 125
(83.9%) patients, gemcitabine therapy was followed by
consolidative radiotherapy at a dose of 30 grays. Patient
observation continued through June 2009. Information
on treatment provided, toxicity, tumor response to therapy, tumor progression, and survival time was collected
by reviewing patients’ medical records in an electronic
database. This study was approved by the institutional
review board of The University of Texas M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center.
Neutropenia, the most common hematologic toxicity caused by gemcitabine, was graded according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. Tumor response to
therapy was evaluated by comparing CT at the time of diagnosis with CT at 6 to 8 weeks after chemoradiotherapy
or chemotherapy, and was defined according to the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors as partial
response, stable disease, or progressive disease. OS and
progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated from the
date of diagnosis to the date of death and progression or
last follow-up date, respectively. Twelve patients were
excluded from PFS analysis because they were lost to

criteria.
Extracting and Genotyping DNA
We selected 17 SNPs of the CDA, dCK, RRM1, DCTD,
hCNT1-3, and hENT1 genes according to the following
criteria: 1) minor allele frequency of the SNP was >10%
among Caucasians, 2) they were coding SNPs including
nonsynonymous or synonymous SNPs, and 3) they were
SNPs that have been associated with cancer risk or clinical
outcome in prior studies. Table 1 summarizes the genes,
nucleotide substitutions, function (such as encoding
amino acid changes), reference SNP identification numbers, and minor allele frequencies of the 17 SNPs evaluated in this study.
Peripheral blood lymphocytes before chemotherapy
were obtained from 149 locally advanced pancreatic
cancer patients with informed consent, and DNA was
extracted using Qiagen DNA isolation kits (Valencia,
Calif). Taqman 50 nuclease assay was performed to determine all genetic variants. Primers and TaqMan MGB
probes were provided by TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay
Services (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif). The
probes were labeled with the fluorescent dye VIC or FAM
for each allele at the 50 end. Polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) was performed in a 5-lL total volume consisting

of TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, 20 ng of genomic
DNA (diluted with dH2O), and TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay Mix. Allele discrimination was accomplished
by running endpoint detection using the ABI Prism
7900HT Sequence Detection System and SDS 2.3 software (Applied Biosystems).

Statistical Methods
The genotype distribution was tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium using the goodness-of-fit chi-square test.
The genotype association with grade 3 to 4 neutropenia
toxicity, and tumor response to therapy was analyzed by
logistic regression. Gemcitabine dose intensity by genotype was compared using t test. OS and PFS were analyzed
by log-rank test, Kaplan-Meier plot, and Cox proportional hazards regression model. The heterozygous and
homozygous genotypes were combined in these analyses if
the frequency of the homozygous mutant was low or if the
homozygous and heterozygous genotypes had the same
direction of effect on toxicity, tumor response, or survival.
Multivariate analyses were performed with adjustment for
clinical predictors that were statistically significant. All
statistical testing was conducted with SPSS software, version 17.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill), and statistical significance and borderline significance were defined as P < .05
and P < .20, respectively.

We estimated the false-positive report probability
for the observed statistically significant associations using
the methods described by Wacholder et al.36 False-positive report probability is the probability of no true association between a genetic variant and a phenotype given a
statistically significant finding. False-positive report probability is determined not only by the observed P value but
also by both the prior probability that the association
between the genetic variant and the phenotype is real and
the statistical power of the test. In the current study, odds
ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR) values of 2.0 to 4.0 were
considered as a likely threshold value. The prior probability used was 0.25 for all SNPs. The false-positive report
probability value for noteworthiness was set at 0.2.

RESULTS
Patients’ Characteristics and Clinical
Predictors
Table 2 shows the patients’ characteristics, clinical features
of their tumors, and treatment. The median age of the
149 patients was 62 years (range, 38-86 years). Non-Hispanic whites comprised 92% of the patients. After a median follow-up of 16.8 months (range, 2-60 months), the
median survival time of all patients was 15.2  0.8
months (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.6-16.9). Tumor response to therapy was significantly associated with
OS (P < .001). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status and presence of diabetes as a comorbidity had a borderline significant association with OS (P
¼ .143 and P ¼ .081) by log-rank test. Although 24
(16.1%) patients had not undergone radiotherapy, that
factor was not associated with OS (P ¼ .503). Concurrent
therapy with a platinum drug also did not impact OS (P
¼ .745).

Genotype Frequencies
We successfully amplified the 17 genotypes in 97.3% to
100% of the samples. Approximately 10% of total samples were analyzed in duplicate, and no discrepancies were
seen. Genotype frequencies of the 17 SNPs were found to
be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (chi-square ¼ 0.001–
2.097, P ¼ .148 to.973). No significant racial differences
in genotype frequency were observed (data not shown).
The 2 SNPs (IVS12 -201A>G and IVS2 -549T>C) of
the hENT1 gene were in linkage disequilibrium (D0 ¼
0.774, P < .01).

5328

Association of Genotypes With Toxicity
None of the clinical factors including concurrent treatment with platinum drug (P ¼ .457) or radiotherapy
(P ¼ .126) was associated with neutropenia, the most
common hematologic toxicity caused by gemcitabine.
The CDA A-76C, dCK C-1205T, RRM1 A33G, and
hENT1 C913T genotypes, individually and jointly, were
significantly associated with severe (grade 3-4) neutropenia (Table 3). For example, 39 (43.8%) of the CDA-76
AC/CC carriers compared with only 15 (25.0%) of the
AA carriers had severe neutropenia (P ¼ .020). Patients
carrying 2 or 3 to 4 at-risk alleles had a significantly
higher frequency of severe neutropenia than did patients
carrying only 0 to 1 at-risk alleles (OR, 3.24; 95% CI,
1.19–8.82; P ¼ .021 and OR, 11.0; 95% CI, 4.02–30.1,
P < .001, respectively; Table 3). The false-positive report
probability was .02 for patients carrying 3 to 4 at-risk
genotypes, indicating noteworthiness. No significant
association of toxicity was observed in the remaining
SNPs (data not shown).
Association of Genotypes With Tumor
Response to Therapy
One hundred forty-nine locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients were analyzed on treatment effect. Radiation
therapy and platinum drug use did not correlate with tumor response (P ¼ .858 and P ¼ .562). Two SNPs, CDA
A-76C and hENT1 A-201G, were significantly associated
with tumor response in radiological evaluation after
adjusting for age (P ¼ .017 and P ¼ .019; Table 4). For
example, 41 (48.2%) of the CDA-76 AC/CC carriers
compared with 16 (27.6%) of the AA carriers had a poor
response to gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. Patients
carrying 1to 2 at-risk alleles had a significantly worse
response to therapy than did patients carrying no at-risk
alleles (OR, 3.40; 95% CI, 1.49–7.78; P ¼ .004). The
false-positive report probability was 0.097 for patients
carrying 1 to 2 at-risk genotypes, indicating noteworthiness. Gemcitabine dose intensity was slightly lower in
CDA CC/AC variant carriers (683  31 mg/m2) than in
the AA carriers (752  46 mg/m2), but the difference was
not statistically significant (P ¼ .217).
Genotype Frequency and Its
Association With OS and PFS
None of the examined 17 SNPs was associated with OS
(data not shown). The data of 137 locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients were available for PFS analysis.

DISCUSSION
Our results in this study support the hypothesis that SNPs
of gemcitabine metabolic and transporter genes are
associated with clinical outcome in patients with locally
advanced pancreatic cancer. The gene variants of CDA A76C, dCK C-1205T, RRM1 A33G, and hENT1 C913T
correlated with severe neutropenia. In addition, the CDA
A-76C and hENT1 A-201G genotypes were significantly
associated with tumor response to gemcitabine-based
therapy and were marginally associated with PFS. These
genotype effects remained significant after adjusting for
clinical predictors in statistics.
CDA is involved in the salvage pathway of pyrimidine and plays a key role in detoxifying gemcitabine.9
Three main SNPs have been identified in the CDA
gene: C111T (T145T), A-76C (K27Q), and G208A
(A70T).8,37,38 Although the CDA 208AA homozygote allele and its related haplotype have been associated with
severe drug toxicity in Japanese cancer patients treated
with gemcitabine plus cisplatin, we excluded this SNP
from our study because CDA G208A had not been
detected in Caucasians.29,31,32 The CDA A-76C variant C
allele (Gln27) has been reported to have moderately or
significantly lower deaminase activity for gemcitabine or

lower deaminase activity of the C allele (Gln27) variant,
which is consistent with previously reported data from in
vitro studies.28,39 Although our results indicated that the
CDA -76 CC/AC variant was also associated with poorer
tumor response, we do not believe this is because of dose
reductions, as there was no significant difference in the
gemcitabine dose intensity in the CDA -76 CC/AC variant carriers as compared with the AA carriers. Nevertheless, there were controversial findings on this SNP in
previous studies. The CDA A-76C variant A allele (Lys27)
had significantly lower deaminase activity than the C allele (Gln27) in a study conducted in 90 patients with lung
cancer.40 The Lys27 haplotype did not show any significant effect on gemcitabine pharmacokinetics in a study of
256 Japanese patients.32 Future studies are warranted to
clarify the functional and clinical importance of this SNP
in gemcitabine therapy.
dCK is the rate-limiting enzyme for intracellular
activation of gemcitabine and was therefore thought to
play an important role in sensitivity to gemcitabine.9
Some studies have shown that the enzyme activity or
expression level of dCK was associated with sensitivity
to gemcitabine and survival of pancreatic cancer
patients.17,41 Shi et al reported that the haplotype containing dCK C-360G and C-201T had a significant association with higher levels of dCK mRNA and longer
survival time in patients with acute myeloid leukemia
treated with cytosine arabinoside.20 Our study showed
a significantly higher toxicity in patients with the

this SNP is located in the intronic region, it is not clear
whether it directly affects dCK enzyme activity or whether
it is in linkage disequilibrium with other functional SNPs
or other genes.
RRM1 is essential for DNA synthesis and repair.9
Davidson et al reported that the increased mRNA level of
RRM1 resulted in drug resistance.26 In a different study,
Rha et al demonstrated a strong association between gem-

5332

citabine-induced neutropenia and the RRM1 haplotype
containing 2 SNPs (A2455G and G2464A).33 Our data
showed that the RRM1 33AA variant was significantly
associated with severe toxicity, suggesting a high susceptibility of this variant to gemcitabine. RRM1 A33G is a synonymous SNP (T741T) that does not produce amino
acid change. However, Kimchi-Sarfaty et al reported that
a synonymous SNP in the MDR1 gene yielded a protein
product with altered drug and inhibitor interactions.42

Figure 2. A Kaplan-Meier plot to assesses the combined genotype effect of CDA -76AC/CC, RRM1 33AA, RRM1 -27AC,
and hENT1 -201GG on progression-free survival. The number
0 to 4 indicates the number of at-risk genotypes associated
with reduced progression-free survival (log-rank P ¼ .002).

Thus, the functional consequence of RRM1 A33G SNP
should be further investigated.
Nucleoside transporters have been thought to have
an important role in gemcitabine cytotoxicity and efficacy.16 Gemcitabine intracellular uptake is mediated
mainly by hENT1 and, to a lesser extent, by hCNT1 and
hCNT3,9 supporting our current observations that the
hENT1 C913T genotype was significantly associated with
neutropenia toxicity and the hENT1 A-201G genotype
with tumor response to gemcitabine and PFS. Although 2
previous studies on the nonsynonymous SNPs of hENT1
failed to demonstrate functional diversity,43,44 it was
reported that the CGG/CGC haplotypes of the hENT1
promoter region containing the C-1345G, G-1050A, and
G-706C SNPs showed moderately higher expression of
hENT1.45 The functional significance of the polymorphic
variants investigated in our current study has not yet been
demonstrated. Considering that hENT1 expression has
been associated with survival of patients with pancreatic
cancer,27 further genotype-phenotype analysis would be
needed to clarify whether the hENT1 genotype can be
used as a surrogate marker for hENT1 activity.
In this study, we focused on locally advanced pancreatic cancer, because metastatic pancreatic cancer is
associated with greater clinical and biological heterogeneity, and in most instances patients were seen in consultation at our institute but their primary treatments for
metastatic disease were administered at other referring
facilities. Compared with findings of our previous study

Cancer

November 15, 2010

in patients with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer
who underwent neoadjuvant gemcitabine-based chemoradiation,34 although the clinical characteristics of the 2
study populations are quite different, the association of
dCK-1205 T allele with severe gemcitabine toxicity and
hENT1-201 A allele with better survival were observed in
both studies, suggesting the robustness of these findings.
In most locally advanced pancreatic cancer cases, tissue
samples are unavailable for measurement of protein
expression. Therefore, if genotyping data from peripheral
blood DNA is validated and found to be a reliable predictor for gemcitabine toxicity and efficacy, application of
such data would be widely beneficial for patients with
unresectable advanced pancreatic cancer.
In conclusion, genotypes of gemcitabine metabolic
and transporter genes have potential as predictive biomarkers for toxicity and treatment effects of gemcitabinebased therapy in locally advanced pancreatic cancer
patients. Our observations still need to be confirmed in
separate and larger patient populations. If confirmed,
these findings may be helpful in stratifying patients to
individualized therapy.
