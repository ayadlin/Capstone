Abstract
Author Manuscript

Tumor metastasis is the primary cause of death of cancer patients. Development of new
therapeutics preventing tumor metastasis is urgently needed. Migrastatin is a natural product
secreted by Streptomyces 1,2, and synthesized migrastatin analogues are potent inhibitors of
metastatic tumor cell migration, invasion and tumor metastasis 3–6. Here we show that these
migrastatin analogues target the actin-bundling protein fascin to inhibit its activity. X-ray crystal
structural studies reveal that migrastatin analogues bind to one of the actin-binding sites on fascin.
Our data demonstrate that actin cytoskeletal proteins, such as fascin, can be explored as new
molecular targets for cancer treatment, similar to the microtubule protein tubulin.

To understand the molecular basis by which migrastatin analogues inhibit tumor cell
migration and tumor metastasis, we pursued the biochemical identification of the protein
target for macroketone. We took an affinity protein purification approach using synthesized
biotin-labeled macroketone 4 (Fig. 1a). Biotin-conjugated macroketone inhibited 4T1 breast
tumor cell migration with a similar potency (IC50 ~ 300 nM) as the non-biotinylated
macroketone (IC50 ~100 nM) 4. 4T1 tumor cell extracts were incubated with biotinconjugated macroketone or with free biotin. Strepavidin conjugated agarose beads were
added. After extensive washes, bound proteins were eluted and resolved by SDS-PAGE. A
protein of approximately 58 kDa was specifically detected in the sample from affinitypurified proteins with biotin-conjugated macroketone, but not in the sample with free biotin
(Fig. 1b). This ~58 kDa protein was identified by mass spectrometry and by peptide
sequence as mouse fascin 1. Fascin is the primary actin cross-linker in filopodia and is
required to maximally cross-link the actin filaments into straight, compact, and rigid bundles
7–12. Elevated expressions of fascin mRNA and protein in cancer cells have been correlated
with aggressive clinical course, poor prognosis and shorter survival 13–21.

Next we verified that macroketone indeed directly interacts with fascin. We purified
recombinant GST-tagged fascin to homogeneity from Escherichia coli (Supplementary Fig.
1a). Purified fascin, but not GST control, specifically interacted with biotin-conjugated
macroketone (Fig. 1c). Moreover, an excess amount of non-biotinylated macroketone
efficiently competed the binding between fascin and biotin-conjugated macroketone
(Supplementary Fig. 1b). Another migrastatin analogue, macrolactam, also competed with
biotin-conjugated macroketone for binding to fascin. Collectively, these data demonstrate
that fascin is a protein target of macroketone.

We then examined the biochemical effect of macroketone on the activity of fascin. We have
used three different approaches to investigate the effect. First, we used purified recombinant
fascin protein, and investigated its actin-bundling activity by the F-actin pelleting assay 9. In
this low-speed centrifugation assay, the pellets contain bundles of F-actin polymers 9.
Purified fascin increased the amounts of F-actin bundles in the pellets (Fig. 1d, e). While
macroketone alone had no effect on the formation of F-actin bundles, macroketone
significantly decreased the fascin-induced bundling of F-actin polymers (Fig. 1d, e). Second,
we used the fluorescence microscopy to visualize the fascin-regulated F-actin filament
bundles in the absence and presence of macroketone (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). Addition of
fascin induced the formation of F-actin bundles, as revealed by the staining of F-actin
filaments with Rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Supplementary Fig. 2a). In contrast, in the
presence of macroketone, formation of F-actin bundles was largely (>80%) inhibited
(Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). Third, electron microscopy was used to examine the actin
bundles (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 2c). The EM examination revealed that
macroketone decreased the thickness of the bundles. These data demonstrate that
macroketone inhibits the actin-bundling activity of fascin.

To reveal the structural basis for the inhibition of fascin function by migrastatin analogues,
we have solved the X-ray crystal structures of fascin without and with a migrastatin
analogue (Fig. 2). We determined the native fascin structure and the structure of fascinmacroketone complex at 1.8 Å and 2.7 Å, respectively (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1).
The overall structure of fascin exhibits four β-trefoil folds, with each β-trefoil comprising of
six two-stranded β-hairpins (Fig. 2a–c, Supplementary Fig. 3–5, and Supplementary Table
2–4). This structure is similar to one fascin structure deposited in the protein structural dada
base (Supplementary Fig. 6). The overall domain arrangement of fascin-macroketone
complex is very similar to that of the native fascin (Fig. 2d). The bound macroketone
molecule sits at the surface of trefoil 4, on the side facing the cleft between trefoil 4 and
trefoil 1 (Fig. 2d, e and Supplementary Fig. 7). Macroketone is held in place by interacting
with the side chains of His392, Glu391, Ala488, Lys471, and His474 as well as the alpha
carbon of Asp473 (Fig. 2d, e and Supplementary Fig. 8). His392 and His474 contribute to
the binding of macroketone through hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2e). The interaction between
fascin and macroketone is further stabilized by the van der Waals force between the
macrolide ring carbon and residue Glu391, Ala488, Lys471 and Asp473 (Fig. 2e). These
structural data are consistent with our previous structure-activity studies on migrastatin
analogues that the macrolide ring, instead of the long side-chain of migrastatin, was
important for the inhibitory function on tumor cell migration4.

The structure of the fascin-macroketone complex immediately suggests a possible
biochemical mechanism by which macroketone inhibits the actin bundling activity of fascin.
The macroketone binding site is one of the actin-binding sites on fascin (Fig. 3a). Therefore,
we propose that macroketone binding interferes with the binding of actin filament to fascin.
Fascin functions as a monomer to bundle actin filaments, and it has been proposed that
fascin has two actin-binding sites for this bundling activity 22. Previous mutagenesis studies
implied that both the N- and the C -termini of fascin contribute to actin binding. Our crystal
structure implicates that the N- and C-termini constitute one of the actin-binding sites (Fig.
3a). Both the N-and C-termini are located in the same cleft (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, a stretch
of residues from 29 to 42 at the N-terminal, which has similarity to an actin-binding site of
MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich C-kinase substrate) 23, is also facing the trefoil 1–4
cleft (Fig. 3a). Moreover, the actin bundling activity of fascin is negatively regulated by a
protein kinase C phosphorylation site (Ser39) within the N-terminal region 22 (Fig. 3a).
Together, these data suggest that this cleft represents one of the actin-binding sites.

Author Manuscript

To investigate this hypothesis that macroketone binding site overlaps with one of the actinbinding sites, we mutated five residues involved in macroketone binding and examined the
actin bundling activity of those fascin mutants (Fig. 3b–d). Indeed, mutations of His392,
Lys471 and Ala488 decreased the actin bundling activity of fascin (Fig. 3c, d). These data
demonstrate that residues involved in macroketone binding are involved in actin bundling.
Furthermore, we examined the sensitivity of the actin bundling activity of Glu391 and
His474 to macroketone (mutants His392, Lys471 and Ala488 were not tested due to their
defective actin bundling activity). As shown in Fig. 3e and f, mutation of His474 to Ala
rendered fascin resistant to macroketone treatment. Moreover, this His474 to Ala mutant
fascin did not bind to biotin-macroketone (Fig. 3g). Taken together, our data demonstrate
that several fascin residues (such as His392, Lys471 and Ala488) involved in macroketone
binding also contribute to actin binding. Hence, the macroketone binding site is one of the
actin-binding sites.

To further critically evaluate that macroketone inhibits fascin to decrease tumor cell
migration, invasion and metastasis, it would be the best to have a fascin mutant that does not
bind to macroketone, but retains its actin-bundling activity. This mutant fascin should confer
resistance to macroketone in tumor cell migration, invasion and metastasis. Our above data
showed that His474 is essential for the macroketone binding, but not for actin-bundling (Fig.
3). To confirm that fascin His474Ala mutant could support tumor cell migration, invasion
and metastasis, we used RNA interference to down-regulate fascin protein levels in 4T1
mouse mammary tumor cells. While two fascin shRNAs (small hairpin RNAs) knocked
down the fascin protein levels, a control shRNA did not (Supplemental Fig. 9a). Fascin
shRNA-treated cells grew at comparable rates as control shRNA-treated cells and nontransfected 4T1 cells in full growth medium (Supplementary Fig. 9b), suggesting fascin is
not required for breast tumor cell proliferation in vitro. This is consistent with our previous
observation that migrastatin analogues had no effect on tumor cell proliferation and primary
tumor growth in mouse models 5. Boyden chamber cell migration assay showed that fascin
shRNA treatments, but not treatment with the control shRNA, decreased the serum-induced
migration of 4T1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 9c). Moreover, this inhibitory effect of fascin

shRNA could be rescued by transfection of human fascin cDNA (there are two nucleotide
changes without amino acid changes in this specific region) (Fig. 4a). This rescued
migration was sensitive to macroketone (Fig. 4a). Although mutations of His474 to either
Lys (Drosophila fascin has a Lys in the corresponding position) or Ala in human fascin also
rescued the migration of 4T1 cells treated with fascin siRNAs (Fig. 4a), these rescued
migrations were not inhibited by macroketone (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 9d).
Additionally, we performed the rescue experiments of fascin-shRNA-treated 4T1 cells with
villin, another actin-bundling protein. From Drosophila genetic studies, villin partially
rescued the phenotypes of fascin mutations during Drosophila oogenesis 24. Villin did not
bind macroketone in vitro, and over-expression of villin in fascin-shRNA treated 4T1 cells
partially rescued the migration which was insensitive to macroketone (Supplementary Fig.
9e). Similarly, expression of human wild-type fascin and His474Ala fascin mutant in fascin
shRNA-treated mouse 4T1 cells rescued tumor cell invasion (Fig. 4b). The rescued invasion
by wild-type fascin, but not by His474Ala mutant fascin, was sensitive to macroketone (Fig.
4b and Supplementary Fig. 9f). Moreover, fascin His474Ala mutation confers macroketone
resistance in tumor metastasis (Fig. 4c, d). Fascin shRNA treatment abolished 4T1 tumor
cell metastasis in mouse models (Fig. 4c,d). Macroketone significantly inhibited the
metastasis in mice injected with control shRNA-treated cells. Wild-type human fascinrescued 4T1 cells metastasized to the lung, and this metastasis was inhibited by macroketone
(Fig. 4d). On the other hand, although re-expression of His474Ala mutant fascin rescued the
tumor metastasis, this metastasis was insensitivity to macroketone (Fig. 4d). These results
further confirm that fascin is the protein target for macroketone in its inhibition of tumor cell
migration, invasion and metastasis.

With the future clinical application in mind to use fascin inhibitors for human cancer
treatments, we further investigated the inhibition of lung colonization of human breast tumor
cells in immune-deficient mouse models by fascin inhibitors such as fascin shRNAs and
macroketone. MDA-MB-231 cells were retrovirally infected with a triple-fusion protein
reporter construct encoding herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase 1, green fluorescent
protein (GFP) and firefly luciferase (TGL) 25,26. These cells were injected into the tail vein
of immuno-deficient mice [NOD-SCID mice]. The lung colonization of tumor cells was
monitored by non-invasive bioluminescence imaging (Fig. 4e,f, Supplementary Fig. 10a–d)
20. A substantial attenuation of bioluminescence signal was observed within the first few
days, indicating that cells that failed to metastasize were not able to survive (Fig. 4e, f).
Progressively increasing signals after two weeks in mice with control shRNA-treated tumor
cells indicated that cells had succeeded in metastasizing and proliferating (Fig. 4e, f).
Strikingly, the presence of fascin shRNA treated cells in the lung was much less than control
shRNA-treated cells (Fig. 4e, f). Therefore, fascin shRNA treatments significantly inhibited
the lung colonization. Second we have further demonstrated here that macroketone could
effectively block the lung colonization of human breast tumors in an animal model. As
shown in Fig. 4g, macroketone reduced the lung colonization of MDA-MB-231 cells by
>80%. Together, our data demonstrate the feasibility of using the inhibitors of fascin (such
as macroketone and the siRNAs) as therapeutic agents for treating metastatic breast tumors.

Fascin mRNA transcript and protein levels are significantly elevated in clinically aggressive
tumors 17,27. Overexpression of fascin leads to increases in cell migration and invasion 28,29.
We have analyzed a microarray gene expression data set with 137 breast cancer samples and
16 normal breast samples from patients treated at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center. Breast tumor samples showed elevated fascin expressions comparing to normal
samples. Moreover, we observed a significant high level of fascin transcripts in the estrogen
receptor (ER)-negative group of patients (Supplementary Fig. 11a) and progesterone
receptor (PR)-negative group of patients (Supplementary Fig. 11b). Immunohistology
staining with anti-fascin antibody confirmed that fascin protein was up regulated in ERnegative tumors (Supplementary Fig. 11c), while ER-positive tumor cells were negative for
fascin staining (note that endothelia of vessels are fascin positive). Furthermore, we
analyzed fascin mRNA expression levels in the Rosetta microarray data set of 295 breast
cancer patients 30. Similarly, we found that the levels of fascin transcripts were significantly
higher in ER-negative and PR-negative tumors (Supplementary Fig. 11d,e).
Overexpression of fascin contributes to a more aggressive clinical course of cancer 16. The
Rosetta data set contains detailed clinical follow-up information of breast cancer patients.
Thus, we evaluated the clinical and pathological associations of fascin expression in breast
cancer patients. Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that higher fascin expression was associated
with lower overall survival (Supplementary Fig. 11f) and lower metastasis-free survival
(Supplementary Fig. 11g). These data highlight the correlation between higher fascin
expression and metastasis and death in human breast caner patients.

Crystallization and Structure Determination

Author Manuscript

To obtain crystals of the fascin-macroketone complex, the protein was incubated for one
hour at room temperature in the protein buffer implemented with 2 mM macroketone.
Crystallization was performed by the vapour diffusion hanging drop method at 20°C. Fascin
crystallized in 100 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, 16% PEG4000, 1% isopropanol. Both crystals
(fascin without or with macroketone) belong to C2 space group. X-ray diffraction data were
recorded at National Synchrotron Light Source beamline X6A and X4C at Brookhaven
National Laboratory. A partial structure was initially solved by the MR-SAD method using a
seleni-methionine derivative sample that diffracted to 2.1 Å and a fraction of the 1DFC pdb
file. This model was subsequently extended by iterative model building and refinement
cycles using COOT and REFMAC5.

In Vitro Wound-healing Assay

Author Manuscript

Cell migration assays were performed as described previously 32,33. Cells were allowed to
form a confluent monolayer in a 24-well plate coated with gelatin before wounding. The
wound was made by scraping a conventional pipette tip across the monolayer. The migration
was induced by adding medium supplemented with 10% FBS. When the wound for the
positive control closed, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and stained with crystal
violet staining solution.
Boyden Chamber Cell Migration Assay

Author Manuscript

Cells (5 ×104) suspended in starvation medium were added to the upper chamber of an insert
(6.5 mm diameter, 8-μm pore size, Becton Dickenson), and the insert was placed in a 24well dish containing starvation medium with or without 10% FBS 32,33. When used,
inhibitors were added to both chambers. Migration assays were carried out for 4~6 hours
and cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. Cells were stained with crystal violet staining
solution, and cells on the upper side of the insert were removed with a cotton swab. Three
randomly selected fields (10 × objectives) on the lower side of the insert were photographed,
and the migrated cells were counted. The migration was expressed as either the average
number of migrated cells in a field or as percentage of migrated cells in positive control.
Percentage was calculated with the formula P=100 × (M–Mpc)/Mpc, where P is the
percentage of migrated cells, M is the number of migrated cells, Mpc is the number of
migrated cells in negative controls, and Mpc is the number of migrated cells in positive
controls.
Cell Invasion Assay

Author Manuscript

Cells (1 ×105) suspended in starvation medium were added to the upper chamber of a
Matrigel-coated insert (6.5 mm diameter, 8-μm pore size, Becton Dickenson), and the insert
was placed in a 24-well dish containing medium with or without serum. When used,
inhibitors were added to both chambers. Invasion assays were carried out for 16 hours and
cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. Cells were stained with crystal violet staining
solution, and cells on the upper side of the insert were removed with a cotton swab. Three
randomly selected fields (10 × objectives) on the lower side of the insert were photographed,
and the cells on the lower surface of the insert were counted.
Protein Expression and Purification

Author Manuscript

Recombinant GST-fascin fusion protein was produced in BL21 Escherichia coli. A 1-liter
culture wasgrown to an A600 reading of 1.0 and then induced by additionof 0.3 mM
isopropyl 1-thio-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) for 12 hours at 25°C. Cells were flash frozen
and then lysed by sonication in Tris-buffered saline. The supernatant was then incubated
with glutathione-Sepharose for 2 h at 4°C. After extensive washing, GST-fascin was eluted
and concentrated with a Centricon Plus-20 (Millipore). To remove the GST tag from the
fusion protein, beads were incubated with thrombin overnight at 4°C. The supernatant was
collected and concentrated.

GST-fascin and Biotin-macroketone Interaction

Author Manuscript

Purified recombinant fascin protein or control protein were incubated with biotinmacroketone for 2 h at 4°C. Proteins associated with biotin-macroketone were precipitated
with Ultralink-immobilized Strepavidin agarose (Pierce). After extensive washing, bound
proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE.
F-Actin Bundling Assay

Author Manuscript

Actin bundling activity was measured by low speed centrifugation assay and fluorescence
microscopy. In low-speed centrifugationassay, monomeric rabbit G-actin was induced to
polymerize at room temperature in F-actin buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl at pH 8, 1 mM ATP, 1
mM DTT, 2 mM MgCl2 and 100 mM KCl). Recombinant fascin proteins or control buffer
were subsequently incubated with F-actin for 60 min at room temperature and centrifuged
for 30 min at 10,000g in an Eppendorf 5415D table-top centrifuge. Both supernatants and
pellets were dissolved in an equivalent volume of SDS sample buffer, and the amount of
actin was determined by SDS-PAGE. We measured the intensities of fascin proteins in
Coomassie-stained gels and then calculated the “relative actin bundling activity” by the
following formula. P=100 × Mp/Mpc, where P is the relative actin bundling activity, Mp is
the percentage of actin that is present in pellet when mixed with different concentrations of
fascin protein. It alone can be calculated by intensity in pellet/(intensity in pellet + intensity
in supernatant). Mpc is the percentage of actin that is present in pellet when mixed with 0.25
μM fascin, which is used at a saturated concentration determined in our control experiment.

Author Manuscript

In fluorescence microscopy, monomeric G-actin was polymerized as described above. Factin was mixed with recombinant fascin protein in F-buffer and incubated at room
temperature for 30 min. Actin was then labeled by adding 5 % rhodamine–phalloidin to the
mixture. The samples were mounted between a slide and a coverslip coated with poly-lysine
and imaged by fluorescence microscopy. Three randomly selected fields (10 × objectives)
were photographed, and the bundles were counted. The Bundles/Field was expressed as the
average number of bundles ± S.D.
Immunofluorescence Microscopy

Author Manuscript

Cells cultured on gelatin-coated glass coverslips were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS
for 10 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and then
washed with PBS three times. To block nonspecific binding, the cells were incubated with a
solution of PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min and then incubated with
primary antibody at appropriate dilutions for 1 h. After incubation with primary antibody,
cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with fluorescence-conjugated
secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). The coverslips were then fixed onto slides and
imaged using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope.
Electron Microscopy
Samples were absorbed onto freshly glow-discharged, carbon-coated copper grids for 2
minutes and stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Grids were examined using a Zeiss electron
microscopy at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV.

4T1 Breast Tumor Metastasis in Mice

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

All animal work was performed in compliance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of the Weill Medical College. Spontaneous 4T1 mouse breast tumor metastasis
assay was done as described before 31,34. Female BALB/c mice (6–8 week old) were
purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. 4T1 tumor cells (1 × 105) were injected
subcutaneously into the abdominal mammary gland area of mice using 0.1 ml of a singlecell suspension in PBS on Day 0. The dosage of tumor implantation was empirically
determined to give rise to tumors of about 10 mm in diameter in untreated wild type mice
within 21–23 days. Starting on Day 7, when the tumors averaged about 4–5 mm in diameter,
test compounds or control PBS saline were given every day by intraperitoneal injection at 10
mg/kg per mouse until Day 25. On Day 28, the mice were sacrificed. This dosage regiment
was well tolerated with no signs of overt toxicity. Every group included 5 mice. Primary
tumors were measured using electronic calipers on the day the mice were sacrificed.
Numbers of metastatic 4T1 cells in lungs were determined by the clonogenic assay. In brief,
lungs were removed from each mouse on Day 28, finely minced and digested in 5 ml of
enzyme cocktail containing 1 × PBS and 1 mg/ml collagenase type IV for 2 hours at 37°C
on a platform rocker. After incubation, samples were filtered through 70 μm nylon cell
strainers and washed twice with PBS. Resulting cells were suspended, plated with a series of
dilutions in 10 cm tissue culture dishes in RPMI1640 medium containing 60 μM thioguanine
for clonogenic growth. Since 4T1 tumor cells are resistant to 6-thioguanine, metastasized
tumor cells formed foci after 14 days, at which time they were fixed with methanol and
stained with 0.03% methylene blue for counting.
MDA-MB-231 Human Breast Tumor Lung Colonization in Mice

Author Manuscript

NOD-SCID immunodeficient mice were used for experimental lung colonization
experiments. MDA-MB-231 human breast tumor cells expressing the TGL reporter were
trypsinized and washed with PBS. This artificial TGL reporter gene encodes a triple fusion
protein with herpes simplex virus 1 thymidine kinase fused to the N-terminus of enhanced
GFP and firefly luciferase fused to the C-terminus of GFP 34,35. Subsequently 1×106 cells in
0.2 ml PBS were injected into the lateral tail vein. Luciferase-based, noninvasive
bioluminescent imaging and analysis were performed with an IVIS Imaging System
(Xenogen).
Microarray Gene Expression Analysis

Author Manuscript

Gene expression data for fascin was extracted from each tumor sample and mean-centered
across all samples for each. Tissues from primary breast cancers were obtained from
therapeutic procedures performed as part of routine clinical management at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center. All research procedures using human tissue were approved by the
MSKCC institutional review board 36. Tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at −80°C. Each sample was examined histologically using hemotoxylin- and eosinstained cryostat sections. Regions were manually dissected from the frozen block to provide
a consistent tumor cell content of more than 70% in tissues used for analysis. Total RNA
was extracted from frozen tissue by homogenization in guanidinium isothiocyanate-based
buffer (Trizol; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), purified using RNAeasy (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)

and examined for quality using denaturing agarose gel. Complementary DNA was
synthesized from RNA using a T7-promoter-tagged oligo-dT primer. RNA target was
synthesized from cDNA by in vitro transcription, and labeled with biotinylated nucleotides
(Enzo Biochem, Farmingdale, NY). Gene expression analysis was performed using HGU133A and U133B oligonucleotide microarrays according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). To identify the differential gene expression, we used two
different measures: fold change (ratio) between the normalized means of each group of
samples and a Student’s t-test. The microarray data had been previously deposited at Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE2603.
Human fascin-1 expression and purification

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The recombinant human fascin-1 was expressed as GST-fusion protein in E. coli. Typically,
a 1 liter 2YT medium with antibiotic was inoculated with 3ml overnight BL21/DE3 culture
transformed with pGEX4T-Fascin1 plasmid and grown at 37°C until OD600 reached ~0.8.
The culture was then transferred to 22 °C and 0.1 mM IPTG was added for induction. After
overnight induction, the bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 10 min.
The bacteria pellet was snap frozen with liquid nitrogen and suspended in 30 ml 1× PBS
supplemented with 0.2 mM PMSF, 1 mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mM EDTA. After
sonication, the suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 60 min to remove the cell
debris. The supernatant was then incubated with 4 ml glutathione beads (Sigma) at 4 °C for
2 hours. After extensive wash with PBS, the beads were resuspended in 10 ml thrombin
cleavage buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM DTT). Human
Fascin-1 was released from the beads by incubating with 40–100 unit of thrombin overnight
at 4°C. After centrifugation, 0.2 mM PMSF was added to supernatant to inactivate the
remnant thrombin activity. The fascin protein was further purified with a Superdex 200 gel
filtration column and concentrated with Centricon to about 80mg/ml. The typical yield from
a 1 liter culture is about 40 mg.
Crystallization and structure determination

Author Manuscript

The concentrated protein stock solution was diluted with the protein buffer (20 mM Tris, pH
8.0, 40 mM KBr, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT) to 15 mg/ml prior crystallization. In order to
obtain crystals of the fascin-macroketone complex, the protein was incubated for one hour at
room temperature in the protein buffer implemented with 2 mM macroketone.
Crystallization was performed by the vapour diffusion hanging drop method at 20°C. Fascin
crystallized in 100 mM Hepes, pH 8.0, 16% PEG4000, 1% isopropanol. Both crystals
(fascin without or with macroketone) belong to C2 space group. Crystals were briefly
transferred to the cryo-solution which consisted of the crystallization solution implemented
with 15% glycerol and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were recorded
at National Synchrotron Light Source beamline X6A and X4C at Brookhaven National
Laboratory. A partial structure was initially solved by the MR-SAD method using a selenimethionine derivative sample that diffracted to 2.1 Å and a fraction of the 1DFC pdb file.
This model was subsequently extended by iterative model building and refinement cycles
using COOT 37 and REFMAC5 38. The fascin structure was solved by the molecular
replacement method using the Se-Met MR-SAD structure as starting model and finally
refined following the same procedure. The diffraction of some fascin crystals was

dramatically improved by an “annealing” process involving one freeze-thaw-freeze
treatment. A 1.8 Å dataset obtained from an annealed crystal rendered dramatically
improved electronic density map, which was unambiguous throughout almost the entirety of
both molecules in the asymmetric unit. The asymmetric unit contains 2 mostly complete
molecules with the exception of 4 highly flexible loops (residues 1–7, 49–54, and 245–247
in chain A and residues 1–7 and 300–303 in chain B) with poorly defined electron density.
For the crystals of the complex of fascin and macroketone, one of the two molecules in the
asymmetric unit is relatively disordered. An approximately 4σ peak was observed in the
difference density map (Supplementary Fig. 7), near the surface of beta-trefoil 4 of molecule
A, on the side facing the cleft between trefoil 4 and trefoil 1. The ring structure was easily
discernable in the difference map, while densities for the side chains were missing. The
approximate orientation of the macroketone molecule was derived by fitting the macrolide
ring into the density while having the possible polar interactions between macroketone and
fascin in mind.
