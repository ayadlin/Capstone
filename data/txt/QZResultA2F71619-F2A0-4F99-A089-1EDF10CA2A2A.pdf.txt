ABSTRACT
Cancer immunotherapy is the use of the immune system to treat cancer. Our
current research proposed an optional strategy of activating immune system involving
in cancer immunotherapy. When being treated with 2% DMSO in culture medium,
Hepa1-6  cells showed depressed proliferation with no significant apoptosis or
decreased viability. D-hep cells, Hepa1-6 cells treated with DMSO for 7 days, could
restore to the higher proliferation rate in DMSO-free medium, but alteration of gene
expression profile was irreversible. Interestingly, tumors from D-hep cells, not Hepa1-6
cells, regressed in wild-type C57BL/6 mice whereas D-hep cells exhibited similar
tumorigenesis as Hep1–6  cells in immunodeficient mice. As expected, additional
Hepa1-6 cells failed to form tumors in the D-hep-C57 mice in which D-hep cells were
eliminated. Further research confirmed that D-hep-C57 mice established anti-tumor
immunity against Hepa1-6 cells. Our research proposed viable tumor cells with altered
biological features by DMSO-treatment could induce anti-tumor immunity in vivo.

INTRODUCTION

immunity, showed affirmative outcomes [17–21]. Therefore,
developing more approaches to induce protective anti-tumor
immunity would extend the application of immunotherapy
in cancer treatment.
As we know, DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) is an
important amphipathic molecule that is widely used not
only as a solvent for water-insoluble substances but also
as a cryopreservant for cells. In addition, it is elucidated
that DMSO can induce the differentiation of leukemia
cells [22], activate tumor suppressor genes, induce
apoptosis and inhibit the proliferation of various tumors
[22–24]. Moreover, low concentrations of DMSO could
lead to the change of genome-wide DNA methylation and
hydroxymethylation profile as reported recently [25, 26].
However, no report was found on the biological feature 

Cancer has become the leading cause of death with
increasing cases worldwide [1]. As limited efficacy and
considerable side effects burdening the application of
traditional treatments, in recent years, immunotherapy has
emerged as a promising approach for cancer treatment [2–6].
Activating immunization, as one of effective strategies has
been developed for many years. Previous researches have
been trying to target dendritic cells (DCs) [7–9], or taking
the advantages of adjuvant [7, 10–11], virus [12–13] or
specific peptide [14–16] to induce protective anti-tumor
immunity. Especially, recent researches in altering the tumor
microenvironment and depressing the immune-dampening
effects, with multiple mechanism for establishing the

in vivo or ex vivo of the DMSO-treated cells, from which the
DMSO was removed after the treatment. In current research,
we demonstrated that mouse hepatocellular carcinoma cell
line, Hepa1-6 cells (Hep cells), when being treated with 2%
vol DMSO, showed depressed proliferation and cell cycle
arrest with no significant apoptosis or decreased viability.
After DMSO was removed from medium, the proliferation
of DMSO-treated cells was partially recovered and G0/G1
arrest was released. However, the alteration of gene
expression profile has presented to be irreversible. The
more interesting was that the altered cells, D-hep cells, Hep
cells treated with DMSO for 7 days, could induce mice to
establish anti-tumor immunity against Hep cells after being
injected into wild type C57BL/6 mice. Thus, our research
proposed the biological feature of tumor cells treated with
DMSO and confirmed the establishment of anti-tumor
immunity in vivo induced by D-hep cells. This may extend
the potential applications of DMSO-treatment in cancer
immunotherapy as an option to activate immune system
against tumor cells.

cells and Hep cells were injected into C57BL/6  mice,
during the first two weeks after injection, tumor formation
and growth were observed, though D-hep tumors were
smaller than Hep tumors. After that, at the third week after
injection, the D-hep tumors have been soft and smaller
gradually whereas the Hep tumors kept growing. And in the
forth week, D-hep tumors almost regressed and eliminated
while Hep tumors grew much bigger (Figure  2C). The
mice undergoing growth and regression of D-hep tumors
were termed as D-hep-C57  mice. We harvested the
tumors tissues on day 7, 14, 21 and 28 after injection and
confirmed, by haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, that
true tumor tissues, not inflammatory pseudotumors or focal
fibroses, had formed or regressed during the four-week
period (Figure 2D). Moreover, we injected 1 × 107 D-hep
cells into WT-C57 mice to further observe tumorigenesis
of D-hep. As expected, even though the cell number was
increased by 10 times, the D-hep tumors still underwent
formation firstly, regression gradually and elimination
finally (Supplementary Figure 2) during four weeks, which
suggested D-hep cells had no risk of tumorigenesis in vivo.
Besides, we also observed there was no tumor formation
when additional 1  ×  107 Hep cells were injected into
D-hep-C57 mice whereas Hep-tumors continued growing
in WT-C57 mice in four weeks (Supplementary Figure 3).
Interestingly, when D-hep cells were injected on one
side of inguen and Hep cells were injected on the other
side in the same mouse, not only D-hep tumors but also
Hep tumors formed in 10  days and regressed gradually
after that. Both kinds of tumor were eliminated 30 days
after the injection. The difference in tumorigenesis between
them was Hep cells could form bigger tumors than D-hep
cells during 10 days from injection and regressed later and
slower than D-tumors, which were shown as the tumor size
on day 10, 20 and 30 (Figure 2E).

RESULTS
DMSO inhibited the proliferation of Hepa1-6
but did not decrease the cell viability or induce
apoptosis
The results from the CCK-8 assays showed that
comparing with those cultured in growth medium,
Hepa1-6  cells in DMSO-medium exhibited a decreased
proliferation rate (Figure 1A), lower CFE (Figure 1C, 1D)
and arrested cell cycle (Figure 1F) during 7-day incubation,
but not decreased cell viability (Figure 1B) and increased
apoptosis or necrosis (Figure 1E). After removing DMSO
from medium in the following 7 days, D-hep cells could
restore to higher proliferation rate (Figure 1G) than D-hep
cells in DMSO-medium with the releasing of G0/G1 arrest
(Figure 1F).

Effector T cells and NKT cells were activated in
C57BL/6 mice by D-hep cells
To further clarify whether the immune system
participated in the tumor regression of D-hep cells, we next
analyzed several subsets of lymphocytes and cytokines
that could contribute to tumor regression. As shown in
Figure 2A–2D, compared with mice injected with PBS,
the percentage of CD4+ effector T cells (CD4+CD44+)
increased on day 3 (Figure  3A, 3E) after injection.
Following that, CD8+ effector T cells (CD8+CD44+) and
NKT cells (NK1.1+) (Figure  3C, 3D) began expanding
on day 5 and reached their highest level on day 14
(Figure 3B, 3E) at which D-hep-tumors began to regress.
However, the number of Treg cells (CD4+CD25+Foxp3+)
was not significantly altered after D-hep cells were
injected into WT-C57  mice (Figure  3F,  3H) compared
with the control group. Moreover, because the activation
of lymphocytes is usually accompanied by rising level of
IFN-γ and IL-2 in serum [28], which triggers a positive

Tumors derived from D-hep cells regressed in
C57BL/6 mice but not in NOD/SCID or nude mice
To investigate the tumorigenicity of D-hep cells,
1  ×  106 D-hep or Hep cells were suspended in 0.2  ml
of PBS and subcutaneously injected into each side of
inguen of NOD/SCID mice or nude mice. We observed
that in NOD/SCID mice, both D-hep cell- and Hep cellderived tumors, termed as D-hep tumor and Hep tumor
respectively, kept growing during the four-week period
and the final tumor masses were not significantly different
(Figure 2A). In the same way, both D-hep tumors and Hep
tumors could form and grow successfully in nude mice in
30-day (Figure 2B, Supplementary Figure 1).
However, the tumorigenicity of D-hep or Hep cells
were much more different from each other in wild-type
C57BL/6 mice (WT-C57). After the same amount of D-hep

feedback loop for NKT cell expansion and the cytotoxic
activity of CD8+ effector T cells [28, 29], we also assessed
the concentrations of IFN-γ and IL-2 in serum. As
expected, the amount of IFN-γ increased by about 30%
by day 5, and the amount of IL-2 increased by about 40%
by day 21 (Figure 4A, 4B) in D-hep-C57 mouse serum,
which was in accordance with the expansion of NKT cells
and CD8+ effector T cells. In addition, in order to prove
the effector T cells could be recruited into tumor site and
execute anti-tumor immunity, immunohistochemistry
was performed to analyze tumor infiltrating lymphocytes
(TILs). As the results showed (Figure 5A), an increasing
number of both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes subsets were

found on day 7, day 14 and day 21 in D-hep-tumors while
few lymphocytes were found in Hep-tumors. Collectively,
these results elucidated that D-Hep cells activated the

of D-hep-C57 mice to observe whether the Hep cells could
form tumors. In order to confirm the establishment of antitumor immunity, we detected the changes in the proportion
of the T cell subset in spleen by flow cytometry and the
concentration of IFN-γ and IL-2 in serum by ELISA after
Hep challenge. WT-C57 mice injected with 1 × 107 Hep
cells were used as control group.
Results showed that the percentage of CD4+
central memory T cells (CD4+CD44highCD62Lhigh)
increased on day 1 and was maintained at a high level
until day 3 after injection. Subsequently, the CD4+
effector memory T cells (CD4+CD44highCD62Llow)

reached their highest level and were maintained at a
higher percentage than the WT-C57 group at the day
3, 5 and 7 (Figure  6A–6C). Although there was no
significant change in the number of CD8+ central memory
T cells (CD8+ CD44highCD62Lhigh) (Figure  6D, 6E),
a distinct activation of CD8+ effector memory T cells
(CD8+CD44high CD62Llow) appeared on the day 5 after
injection (Figure  6D, 6F) that reached a level that was
3-fold higher than that of WT-C57 mice on the same day
and was maintained till day 7. Meanwhile, the number of
NKT cells was increased 2.5-fold compared with the WTC57 group on day 3, but decreased to a normal level by

day 5 (Figure 6G, 6H). By contrast, there was no statistics
difference in percentage of Treg cells between two groups
(Figure 7I, 7J). Moreover, an increased amount of IFN-γ
and IL-2 in the serum could be detected on days 3 and
day 7 (Figure 7A, 7B), and cytokines reached their highest

levels in serum earlier, with higher concentration, than
that in the first injection of D-hep cells. Collectively, these
results indicated that the D-hep-C57 mice established antitumor immunity and long-term memory T cells against
Hepa1-6 cells.

Splenic T cells can be activated and induce
cytotoxicity when co-cultured with Hepa1-6
cells in vitro

D-hep mouse showed capacity to suppress
tumorigenesis of mouse melanoma cell line
B16-F10

Splenocytes from D-hep-C57  mice or WT-C57
mice were collected and co-cultured with Hep cells at
a ratio of 50:1 or 100:1. The splenocytes were labled
with CFSE previously. 3  days later, the splenocytes
were stained with CD4+ and CD8+ antibodies for flow
cytometry. The results showed that the expansion of
T cells in D-hep-C57  mice was higher than that in
WT-C57  mice for both the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell
subsets (Figure 8A, 8B). In addition, splenocytes from
D-hep-C57 mice presented high frequencies of dividing
CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets, which were increased by
11% in CD4+ T cells and 14.8% in CD8+ T cells, whereas
no reduced fluorescence intensity was observed in
splenocytes from WT-C57 mice (Figure 8C, 8D). In the
meantime, cytotoxicity effects of activated lymphocytes
to Hep cells were assessed through cell viability. CCK-8
assay results exhibited that tumor cells co-cultured with
splenocytes from D-hep-C57  mice showed decreased
cell viability after 3-day-incubation in an effector-target
ratio- or time-dependent manner (Figure  8E). Taken
together, the results indicated that splenocytes from
D-hep-C57  mice could be activated by Hep cells and
presented cytotoxicity to tumor cells antigens in vitro,
which suggests that the immunosurveillance and longterm memory against Hepa1-6 tumor antigens are well
established in D-hep-C57 mice.

To investigate whether D-hep mice can suppress
other tumor growth, we furthered experiments by injecting
other kinds of tumor cells including mouse prostate tumor
cell line RM-1, mouse ascites hepatoma cell line H22 and
mouse melanoma cell line B16-F10 which are all derived
from C57BL/6  mouse. Though D-hep mice showed no
capacity to suppress tumor growth of H22 and RM-1,
B16-F10 tumors were highly depressed in D-hep mice
(Figure  9A, 9B), indicating the anti-tumor immunity
induced by D-hep cells could also suppress the growth of
B16-F10-derived tumors.

DISCUSSION
Existing researches have elucidated the function of
DMSO in inducing cell differentiation [22], suppressing
proliferation and inducing apoptosis [22–24]. Recent
research also pointed out DMSO could change genome-wide
DNA methylation and hydromethylation pattern by
influencing the expression of DNA methyltransferases
(Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b) and TET (ten-eleven
translocation proteins) family [25, 26]. However, researches
mentioned above mainly focused on the status of cells
incubated in DMSO-medium in vitro. Here, we reported the
influence of DMSO on biological characteristics of Hepa1-

Figure 8: Lymphocytes from D-hep-C57 mice were activated by Hep cells and induced cytotoxicity in vitro. (A–B) Flow

cytometry analysis of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in co-culture systems of Hep cells and splenocytes from WT-C57 or D-hep-C57 mice after
3 days of culturing illustrated that lymphocytes from D-hep-C57 mice showed a higher percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compared
with those from WT-C57 mice. (C–D) Flow cytometry analysis of dividing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as shown by CFSE detection in coculture systems of Hep cells and splenocytes from WT-C57 or D-hep-C57 mice after 3 days of culturing, illustrated that only lymphocytes
from D-hep-C57 mice showed reduced fluorescence intensities of 11.0% and 14.8% for CD4+ (C) and CD8+ (D) T cells respectively. (E)
The relative cell viability of Hep cells in the co-culture system was analyzed using CCK-8 assays. Splenocytes from D-hep-C57 (D-group)
or WT-C57 (WT-group) mice were co-cultured with Hepa1-6 cells for 3, 4 or 5 days respectively at effector-target ratios of 50:1 or 100:1

6 cells ex-vivo and in vivo in comprehensive way. First of
all, DMSO didn’t decrease the viability or induce apoptosis
of Hep cells. We speculate that this may result from the
different concentration of DMSO used in experiments or
the difference in tolerance or sensitivity towards DMSO
among cell lines. Also, this result helps to eliminate the
possibility that a large amount of dead or dying D-Hep cells
due to growth-disadvantage lead to the lower proliferation
in vitro and lower tumorigenicity in WT-C57  mice, or
possibilities that antigens exposed in dead or dying cells are
recognized by mouse immune system. Secondly, DMSOtreatment confers D-Hep cells different properties, which
presented as a recovered higher level of proliferation in
growth-medium and different gene expression profile.
The initiative analysis by gene expression array showed
that about more than 1000 genes were altered by DMSOtreatment (Supplementary Table 1). In further investigation,
we selected a part of altered genes and detected their
expression in Hep cells, D-hep cells and Df cells by realtime PCR. The results exhibited that the expression pattern
of selected genes in D-hep cells and Df cells has been
changed compared with Hep cells, meanwhile, to a great
extent, the change of gene expression profile in Df cells kept
pace with that in D-hep cells (Supplementary Figure 4).
This suggests that DMSO-treatment brings an irreversible
change to Hep cells. Though the specific mechanisms about
the alteration still remain unclear, this permanent alteration
might be important clue to explore how D-hep cells induce
anti-tumor immunity in vivo.
The difference of tumorigenesis between D-hep
and Hep cells in vivo is also an evidence on the alteration
of biological features resulting from DMSO-treatment.
The current data showed that D-Hep tumors underwent
the tumor formation, regression and elimination in
WT-C57 mice but formed tumors in the same way as Hep
cells in immunodeficient mice. Considering either NOD/

SCID mice or nude mice are deficient in T lymphocytes,
we tend to believe that T lymphocytes, as major subset,
mediated the anti-tumor immunity, which is also
evidenced by the sequential expansion of T cell subsets,
specific T cells proliferation and cytotoxicity assay.
To our knowledge, the effects of DMSO treatment
on tumor cells in vivo, such as inducing tumor-specific
anti-tumor immunity, have never been reported. In our
study, we observed the sequential activation of CD4+
effector T cells, NKT cells and CD8+ effector T cells. It
is well known that CD8+ effector T cells is a key subset in
effective anti-tumor immunity [30]. And recent researches
uncovered that, as an immunoregulatory population,
NKT cells could participates in antigen recognition,
induce the maturation of CD8+ effector T cells and DCs
in immune responses and thus induce innate and adaptive
anti-tumor immunity [28, 31, 32]. Besides, it has been
reported that the activation and activity of NKT and CD8+
T cells are related to the increasing secretion of IFN-γ
[28, 33–35], which has also been exhibited between
NKT and IFN-γ in a positive correlation as Mattarrolo
[28] reported. Therefore, the results above revealed
lymphocyte activation and NKT cell responses may
contribute to inducing anti-tumor immunity after D-Hep
cells injection. Moreover, the activation of Tcm and Tem in
secondary response that was induced by Hep cells also
exhibited tumor-specific anti-tumor immunity has been
well established in D-hep-C57  mice. Tcm, as a subset
in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with capacity of selfrenewal and differentiation, was thought to mediate recall
responses and expand before Tem, while Tem acquiring
more proliferation potential could mediate protective
immune responses by accessing the tissue sites [36–38],
In our experiments, we observed a rapid expansion of
CD4+ Tcm within one day after Hep cells injection, which
was followed by a 3-fold increase in CD8+ Tem levels.

And also we observed the infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ in
D-hep-tumors. Combing with the results that co-culturing
splenocytes and tumor cells leading to activation of T
cells and cytotoxicity in vitro, we believe the anti-tumor
immunity was memorized, which could be activated and
eliminated tumor cells when encountering the same tumorassociated antigens.
A more interesting phenomena is that when
Hep cells and D-Hep cells were injected into the same
mouse, either Hep-tumor or D-Hep tumor could form
initially but eliminate in the end, especially Hep-tumors
regressed following D-Hep-tumors. These results were
in accordance with the results of lymphocytes activation
induced by D-hep cells and suggested the further
therapeutic use of DMSO-treated tumor cells to trigger
anti-tumor immunity.
Notwithstanding the immunity against Hepa16  cells, the D-hep-C57  mice also showed a capacity
to depress the growth of the other types of tumor. We
observed that when the mouse melanoma cell line
B16-F10  cells were injected into D-hep-C57  mice, the
growth and final weight of tumors were significantly
decreased compared with that in WT-C57  mice. These
results provide indications for exploring the mechanism
of anti-tumor immunity induction and expand the potential
for DMSO treatment as an optional strategy for cancer
immunotherapy.
In summary, our research proposes the biological
feature of tumor cells treated with DMSO and confirmed
the ability of D-hep cells to induce anti-tumor immunity
in vivo, which suggests the possible applications of
DMSO-treatment in tumor immunotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Colony forming efficiency (CFE) assay

Cell culture and mice

Hep cells were seeded into 6-well plates at 1 × 103
cells per well and cultured in complete DMEM culture
medium with or without 2% DMSO. 14 days later, cells
were fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with toluidine
blue O (Sigma, USA). Clones (diameter of more than
0.5 mm) were counted and the results were shown as the
average number of clones counted in 6 independent wells.

Cell proliferation, cell cycle and cell viability
assay
A cell count kit-8 (CCK-8) (Dojindo, Japan) was
used to examine cell proliferation and cell viability.
Hep and D-hep cells were seeded into 96-well plates at
1 × 103 cells per well in complete DMEM medium with or
without 2% DMSO. The day of seeding is day 0 and the
medium of D-hep group was changed into DMSO-medium
at day 1. Following the manufacturer’s instructions, on
day 0 and day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, medium was removed
and 100 ml DMEM containing CCK-8 (10%) was added
to each well. After 2 h incubation at 37°C, the absorbance
at 450 nm of each well was measured using a Microtiter
Plate Reader (TECAN, Switzerland). The average
absorbance of 10 independent wells for each group were
obtained. The proliferating rate everyday was presented by
the ratio of absorbance value of day 1~7 to value of day 0.
Cell cycle for D-hep cells, Hep cells and Df cells,
D-hep cells cultured in DMSO-free medium for 7 days,
was analyzed by using DNA staining Kit (BD, USA) and
subjected to FACS LSR II (BD, USA) for flow cytometry.
1 × 106 cells in each sample and three independent wells
were analyzed.
Cell viability for Hep cells cultured in DMSOmedium for 1  day (DM-1) and 7  days (D-hep) were
analyzed by seeding 1 × 105, 1 × 104, 1 × 103 cells of each
type in 96-well plate and using CCK-8 reagent to monitor
cell viability. Three independent wells were analyzed.

Mouse hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Hepa1-6,
mouse melanoma cell line B16-F10, mouse prostate
tumor cell line RM-1 and mouse ascites hepatoma cell
line H22 were originally purchased from Cell Bank of the
Type Culture Collection (Chinese Academy of Sciences,
Shanghai, China) and were maintained in the Department
of Cell Biology, SMMU. Cells were cultured in complete
DMEM (Hyclone, USA) or RPMI 1640 (Hyclone,
USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Gibco, USA) and 1% 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin
(Hyclone, USA). D-hep cells were obtained by culturing
Hepa1-6 cells in DMSO-DMEM which containing 2% vol
DMSO (Sigma, USA) in DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS and 1% 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin for 7 days
before performing experiments.
C57BL/6  mice, nude mice and NOD/SCID mice
were purchased from Shanghai Research Center for Model
Organisms, and raised in specific pathogen-free (SPF)
animal rooms of Department of Cell Biology, SMMU. This

Detection of apoptosis and necrosis
Apoptotic cells and necrotic cells were analyzed
by double staining with Alexa Fluor 488 annexin V and
propidium iodide (PI) (BD, USA). All cells at exponential
phase, including floating and adherent cells, were collected
and washed for three times with 4°C PBS. 5  μl Alexa
Fluor 488 Annexin V was added to the cell suspension
in the presence of 195  μl binding buffer and incubated
for 20  min at room temperature. Cells were co-stained
with 5 μl PI and immediately analyzed using FACS LSR
II (BD, USA). The percentage of apoptotic (annexinV)
and necrotic (PI) cells was determined using software.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)
of cytokine

Establishment of a D-hep-C57 mouse model with
anti-tumor immunity against Hepa1-6 cells

Mouse blood was harvested from the postocular
venous plexus and centrifuged. The cytokine level in the
mouse serum was detected using IFN-γ or IL-2 ELISA kits
(Excell, China) following the manufacturer’s instructions
and were measured using Microtiter Plate Reader
(TECAN, Switzerland) at 450 nm. At least three mice per
group were included in the analysis.

1 × 106 D-hep cells were injected subcutaneously
into the inguen of 8- to 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice. After
tumor formation and regression, the mice that developed
anti-tumor immunity against Hepa1-6 cells were regarded
as D-hep-C57 mice.

Immunohistochemistry assay of tumor
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)

Tumorigenicity in vivo

Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalinfixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues of 7, 14, 21 and
28 days after the injection of D-hep or Hep cells. Briefly,
after being deparaffinized, rehydrated and antigen retrieval
with tris-EDTA buffer (pH = 9.0), 3 um-thick slides were
blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature.
The slides were then incubated with the primary CD4 and
CD8 monoclonal antibody (BD, USA) at the appropriate
dilution at 4°C overnight and then washed by PBST (PBS
with 0.2% Tween-20, pH = 7.1) for 3 times. Secondary
antibody was incubated at 37°C for 30 min and then slides
were washed by PBST for 3 times. After visualized by
DAB substrate and hematoxylin counterstain, slides were
mounted for microscopy.

Briefly, 1  ×  106 D-hep cells or Hep cells were
injected subcutaneously into the inguen of C57BL/6
(3 mice per group), NOD/SCID mice (6 mice per group)
and nude mice (3 mice per group). The C57BL/6 mice
were sacrificed 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks after injection, NOD/
SCID mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after the injection and
nude mice were sacrificed 20 or 30 days after the injection.
Tumors were harvested and weighed. The results are
shown as the average weights of the tumors.
Besides, to confirm the therapeutic effect of D-hep
cells inducing antitumor immunity, 1 × 106 D-hep cells
were injected subcutaneously into one side of inguen of
8- to 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice while 1 × 106 of Hep
cells were injected into the other side. Tumor size was
calculated with nonius each 10 days after cell injection.
The tumor volume was calculated as (length *width2)/2
or 4πR3/3 (R is tumor radius) depending on the tumor
shape. Tumor size was shown as the average of 6 tumors
per group.
To evaluate the safety of D-hep cells, 1 × 107 D-hep
cells were injected into the inguen of C57BL/6 mice as
above described with 1 × 107 Hep cells as control. Tumor
size was shown as the average of 6 tumors per group.

Cytotoxicity assays
According to the method proposed by Silaeva YY
et al. [27], splenocytes were isolated and co-cultured with
Hepa1-6 cells in 96-well, U-bottom plates at a ratio of 50
effector cells (50,000 cells) to 1 target cell (1,000 cells)
or 100 effector cells (100,000  cells) to 1 target cell
(1,000 cells). The plates were then briefly centrifuged and
cultured at 37°C for 3, 4 or 5 days in complete DMEM.
After collecting the splenocytes for the antigen-specific
T cell proliferation assays, the wells were washed 5 times
to remove the residual splenocytes and then CCK-8
analysis was performed to test the viability of tumor cells

Flow cytometry analysis
The following antibodies were purchased: AntiMouse CD62L (L-Selectin)-FITC, Anti-Mouse-NK1.1FITC, Anti-Mouse-CD44-PE (eBioscience, USA), AntiMouse-CD4-APC and Anti-Mouse-CD8a-APC (R & D
Systems, USA), Anti-Mouse-CD25-FITC and Anti-MouseFoxp3-PE (BD, USA). The Foxp3-Transcription Factor
Staining Buffer Set was purchased from eBioscience (USA).
Cells were stained following the manufacturers’ protocols
with optimal concentrations of mAb. Briefly, splenocytes
from individual mice were prepared in PBS and stained with
antibodies at 4°C for 15 minutes. After washing three times,
the cells were resuspended in washing buffer and analyzed.
Fluorescent data for 10,000 lymphocyte events each sample
were acquired on a FACS LSR II (BD Bioscience, USA)
and were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tomy Digital
Biology Co., Ltd., Japan).

In vitro splenic T cell proliferation assays
According to the method proposed by Silaeva
YYet al. [27], mouse splenocytes were suspended in 0.1%
FBS/PBS at a density of 2 × 107/ml and then pre-labelled
with 5 µM carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE,
Sigma, USA) for 10 minutes at 37°C. Isovolumetric 100%
FBS was then added, and the splenocytes were incubated
in a 37°C water bath for 10 minutes. After the incubation,
the splenocytes were centrifuged (400 g, 5 minutes) and
washed three times with 2% FBS/PBS wash buffer (1 ml
for 106 splenocytes). After washing, the splenocytes were
co-cultured with Hepa1-6 cells for 3 days, and then were
