ABSTRACT
Dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein Mr 32,000 (DARPP-32), also
known as phosphoprotein phosphatase-1 regulatory subunit 1B (PPP1R1B), was
initially discovered as a substrate of dopamine-activated protein kinase A (PKA)
in the neostriatum in the brain. While phosphorylation at Thr-34 by PKA converts
DARPP-32 into a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), phosphorylation at
Thr-75 transforms DARPP-32 into an inhibitor of PKA. Through regulation of DARPP-32
phosphorylation and modulation of protein phosphatase and kinase activities,
DARPP-32 plays a critical role in mediating the biochemical, electrophysiological, and
behavioral effects controlled by dopamine and other neurotransmitters in response
to drugs of abuse and psychostimulants. Altered expression of DARPP-32 and its
truncated isoform (t-DARPP), specifically in the prefrontal cortex, has been associated
with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Moreover, cleavage of DARPP-32 by calpain
has been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease. Amplification of the genomic locus of
DARPP-32 at 17q12 has been described in several cancers. DARPP-32 and t-DARPP are
frequently overexpressed at the mRNA and protein levels in adenocarcinomas of the
breast, prostate, colon, and stomach. Several studies demonstrated the pro-survival,
pro-invasion, and pro-angiogenic functions of DARPP-32 in cancer. Overexpression
of DARPP-32 and t-DARPP also promotes chemotherapeutic drug resistance and cell
proliferation in gastric and breast cancers through regulation of pro-oncogenic signal
transduction pathways. The expansion of DARPP-32 research from neurotransmission
to cancer underscores the broad scope and implication of this protein in disparate
human diseases.

INTRODUCTION

phosphatase-1 regulatory subunit 1B (PPP1R1B).
DARPP-32 has been shown to play a key role in mediating
the biochemical, electrophysiological, and behavioral
effects of dopamine on dopaminoceptive neurons (for
reviews, see [7-9]). DARPP-32 has also been implicated
in mediating the actions of other neurotransmitter systems
such as serotonin and glutamate, in response to a variety
of drugs of abuse (for reviews, see [10, 11]). El-Rifai
and colleagues discovered frequent amplification of
17q12, the locus of DARPP-32, in gastric and esophageal
adenocarcinomas [12, 13]. Subsequently, this group
reported that DARPP-32 and its truncated isoform;
they cloned and named t-DARPP, are amplified and
overexpressed in gastric cancer [14]. This first report led to
a series of studies on the role of DARPP-32 and t-DARPP
in different biological aspects of gastric cancer and other

In a study to characterize the mode of action of
neurotransmitters in different brain regions, Walaas and
colleagues [1] investigated proteins phosphorylated
by calcium- and cyclic-AMP (cAMP)-activated
protein kinases. Notably, a 32-kDa protein was found
abundantly in spiny neurones of the neostriatum. As
the phosphorylation of this protein was regulated by
dopamine and cAMP, it was named DARPP-32 (dopamine
and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein Mr 32,000) [2]. In
addition to the brain, DARPP-32 is expressed in adrenal
medulla, kidney, and parathyroid cells [3-5]. Because
it was shown to inhibit protein phosphatase-1 (PP1)
following phosphorylation of Thr-34 by protein kinase A
(PKA) [6], DARPP-32 is also known as phosphoprotein

malignancies. In this review, we briefly outline the role of
DARPP-32 in neurotransmission and its recent implication
in central nervous system (CNS) disorders, and elaborate
on the novel biological functions of DARPP-32 and
t-DARPP in human carcinogenesis.

different mechanisms. First, in medium spiny neurons
that co-express D1 and D2 classes of dopamine receptors,
activation of D2 receptors decreases cAMP levels. When
D2 receptors are co-expressed with adenosine A2A receptor,
it can result in a decrease of cAMP levels, decreasing
the activity of both PKA and in phosphorylation of
DARPP-32 at Thr-34. Second, activation of D2 receptor
leads to an increase in Ca2+ levels and increased activity of
protein phosphatase 2B (PP-2B), resulting in an increase
in dephosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr-34 [23]. In the
intact striatum, a blockade of tonic dopamine D2 receptor
activation increases DARPP-32 phosphorylation at Thr-34
and can be counteracted by blocking either adenosine A2A
or dopamine D1 receptors [17].
The phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr-34
converts it into a potent inhibitor of PP1 [6, 24, 25]. PP1
is involved in regulating the activity of a large number
of phosphoproteins, including voltage-dependent sodium
and calcium channels, the electrogenic pump Na+, K+ATPase, and neurotransmitter receptors [26]. DARPP-32mediated inhibition of PP1 increases the phosphorylation
of neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels crucial for
synaptic function and plasticity [9]. Bibb and colleagues
reported that DARPP-32 was converted into an inhibitor of
PKA when phosphorylated at Thr-75 by cyclin-dependent
kinase 5 (Cdk5) [27]. Decreasing phospho-Thr-75
DARPP-32 in striatal slices, either by a Cdk5-specific
inhibitor or by using genetically altered mice, increases
dopamine-induced phosphorylation of PKA substrates and
augments peak voltage-gated calcium currents [28, 29].
This suggests that, depending on which particular amino
acid residue is phosphorylated, DARPP-32 can function as
either a kinase or a phosphatase inhibitor. This unique dual
action appears to be especially important in regulating
the efficacy of dopaminergic neurotransmission [8, 27]
(Figure 1).
Casein kinase 1 (CK1) can phosphorylate

MODULATION OF DARPP-32 IN
NEUROTRANSMISSION AND CNS
DISORDERS
Since its discovery three decades ago, DARPP-32
has been shown in a large body of work as a central
signaling molecule activated by a diverse array of
neurotransmitters such as dopamine, glutamate,
serotonin, adenosine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid
(GABA) [9, 15, 16]. In response to drugs of abuse and
psychostimulants, these neurotransmitters regulate the
phosphorylation state of DARPP-32, which converts it
to an inhibitor of either a protein phosphatase (PP1) or
a protein kinase (PKA). The state of phosphorylation of
DARPP-32 is regulated by tonic activation of dopamine
D1 and D2 receptors, and adenosine A2A receptor [17].
DARPP-32 may be phosphorylated at Thr-34 by PKA
in distinct subpopulations of medium spiny neurons
that express either D1 or A2A receptors [18, 19]. Like
dopamine, adenosine acts on A2A receptor, using cAMP as
a mediator in the process, activating PKA and increasing
DARPP-32 phosphorylation at Thr-34 [20]. The D2
receptor exists as two different isoforms generated by
alternative splicing: the long (D2L) and the short (D2S)
[21]. The D2S receptor specifically regulates the state
of phosphorylation and activity of tyrosine hydroxylase
(TH) in nigrostriatal presynaptic terminals, whereas
the D2L receptor is mainly involved in the regulation
of DARPP-32 phosphorylation in postsynaptic striatal
medium spiny neurons [22]. Activation of the D2
receptor decreases DARPP-32 phosphorylation by two

protein kinases is indicated by green arrows, whereas dephosphorylation of DARPP-32 by protein phosphatases is depicted by red arrows.
Phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr-34 by PKA converts it into a potent inhibitor of PP1. However, phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at
Thr-75 by CDK5 transforms it into an inhibitor of PKA. Dephosphorylation of Ser-137 by PP2C facilitates dephosphorylation of Thr-34
by PP2B, thereby removing the PKA-induced inhibition of PP1. Phosphorylation of Ser-45 and Ser-102 has no effect on the potency of
DARPP-32 as an inhibitor of PP1. The scheme is based on [29].

18 genes such as ERBB2, TOP2A, GRB7, and expression
sequence tag (EST AA552509) in gastric cancers [38]. ElRifai and colleagues demonstrated that EST AA552509
was frequently amplified and consistently overexpressed
at 17q in gastric cancers, and they were first to report
that DARPP-32 is the target gene for overexpression of
EST AA552509 [14]. Cloning and sequence assembly
analyses indicated that EST AA552509 corresponded to
the 3’-untranslated region of the DARPP-32 gene. Further
analyses of the nearby ESTs, two ESTs (BF725600 and
BF724182) were found to overlap with the 5’ end of
DARPP-32 exon 1. An additional 467 bp untranslated
mRNA sequence of DARPP-32 was identified upstream
of the previously known translation start site in exon 1.
Additional cloning and sequencing verified the fulllength DARPP-32 cDNA sequence (AF464196). A novel

DARPP-32 at Ser-137, which has an important regulatory
role because it inhibits the dephosphorylation of Thr-34
by calcineurin. This inhibition takes place only when
phospho-Ser-137 and phospho-Thr-34 are present on
the same DARPP-32 molecule [30]. Phosphorylation of
DARPP-32 by CK1, which is highly active in striatonigral
neurons, does not alter its ability to inhibit PP1 [30].
DARPP-32 phosphorylated by CK1 is a substrate for
protein phosphatases 2A and 2C. However, in substantia
nigra slices, dephosphorylation of Ser-137 was markedly
sensitive to decreased temperature, and not significantly
affected by the presence of okadaic acid under conditions
where dephosphorylation of Thr-34 by protein phosphatase
2A was inhibited. This suggests that, in neurons,
phospho-Ser-137 DARPP-32 is dephosphorylated by
protein phosphatase 2C, but not 2A. Thus, DARPP-32
appears to be a component of a regulatory cascade of
phosphatases in which dephosphorylation of Ser-137 by
protein phosphatase 2C facilitates dephosphorylation
of Thr-34 by calcineurin, removing the cAMP-induced
inhibition of PP1 [31]. DARPP-32 is also phosphorylated
on Ser-45 and Ser-102 by casein kinase 2 (CK2) [32].
Phosphorylation by CK2 has no effect on the potency of
DARPP-32 as an inhibitor of PP1, which strictly depends
on phosphorylation of Thr-34 by cAMP-dependent protein
kinase [33] (Figure 1).
Following the discovery of t-DARPP by El-Rifai’s
group in cancer [14], post-mortem studies on human
brains suggest that the expression of t-DARPP transcript is
altered in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder
specifically in the prefrontal cortex, and the higher
t-DARPP expression was associated with worse cognitive
performance [34]. Another study indicated a selective
reduction in DARPP-32 expression in the prefrontal
cortex in patients with schizophrenia, suggesting that
altered expression of DARPP-32 may be associated with
the development of the disease [35]. Cho and colleagues
investigated the role of DARPP-32 in Alzheimer’s disease
(AD), and found that DARPP-32 is cleaved at Thr-153
by calpain, which reduces the phosphorylation of cAMPresponse element-binding protein (CREB), a target of PP1
and important for cognitive function. The cleavage of
DARPP-32 induces loss of its inhibitory function on PP1.
The data suggest a novel mechanism by which cleavage
of DARPP-32 leads to dysregulation of CREB signaling
in AD [36].

transcriptional splice variant of DARPP-32 was
cloned from gastric cancer tissues (AY070271) and

termed truncated isoform of DARPP (t-DARPP) [14].
The novel molecule, t-DARPP, has a unique alternative
first exon located within intron 1 of DARPP-32. While
DARPP-32 encodes 204 amino acids protein containing
four phosphorylation sites (Thr-34, Thr-75, Ser-102, and
Ser-137), t-DARPP encodes 168 amino acids protein
lacking the Thr-34 phosphorylation site related to PP1
inhibition but maintains the other three phosphorylation
sites (Figure 2). Concomitant overexpression of
DARPP-32 and t-DARPP was demonstrated in 68% of
gastric cancers [39]. In addition, several studies indicated
frequent overexpression of DARPP-32 and t-DARPP in
adenocarcinomas of the breast, prostate, and colon [4043]. These findings suggest that DARPP-32 proteins
could be implicated in critical steps in the carcinogenesis
cascade. Further studies were prompted to investigate the
functional role of DARPP-32 and t-DARPP primarily in
gastric cancer and other types of malignancies.

DARPP-32 in tumorigenesis
A few studies have attempted to examine the
role of DARPP-32 in the multistep cascade of gastric
carcinogenesis. A study using immunohistochemistry
analysis on 533 human gastric cancer tissues indicated
that DARPP-32 is overexpressed in early stages of gastric
tumorigenesis, suggesting that this molecular event may
participate in the transition to intestinal metaplasia and
in the progression to adenocarcinoma [44]. Based on the
concept that fusion genes, which result from chromosomal
rearrangements or abnormal transcription, act as potent
oncogenes in many types of cancer [45, 46], Yun and
colleagues [47] identified novel gene fusions in human
gastric cancer cells and tissues. Notably, the presence of
DARPP-32-STARD3 fusion transcript, which appears to
be generated by RNA processing without chromosomal
rearrangement, was exclusively detected in a subset of

IDENTIFICATION AND IMPLICATION OF
DARPP-32 IN CANCER
Earlier studies using comparative genomic
hybridization have pointed out to frequent amplification at
the 17q12 locus in several malignancies including gastric
and esophageal cancers [12, 13, 37]. A systematic analysis
of copy number and expression levels of the 17q ampliconspecific genes revealed an increase in copy numbers of

knockout of the DARPP-32 gene in MMTV (mouse

of DARPP-32 proteins in breast tumorigenesis [49].

gastric cancers (21.3%) but not in adjacent matched normal
gastric tissues. Overexpression of DARPP-32-STARD3
significantly increases gastric cancer cell proliferation in
vitro and gastric tumor xenograft growth in nude mice.
These effects are mediated by activation of the PI3K/
AKT signaling pathway [47]. These findings strongly
suggest that DARPP-32-STARD3 fusion transcript
promotes tumorigenesis in gastric cancer. Another study
included an investigation on the role of DARPP-32 in
gastric tumorigenesis through regulation of CD44 splicing
[48]. The findings indicated that DARPP-32 positively
regulates the overall splicing activity, and specifically
promotes the expression of the splice isoform, CD44E,
in gastric cancer cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that
DARPP-32 associates with SRp20 splicing factor in a
protein complex, thereby stabilizing SRp20 protein and
increasing its expression. Modulation of DARPP-32
expression indicated that DARPP-32 regulates the
SRp20-dependent CD44E splicing and gastric tumor
growth in a xenograft mouse model. Notably, the study
indicated frequent overexpression of DARPP-32, SRp20
and CD44E proteins in human gastric primary tumors,
further establishing an important role for DARPP-32 in
gastric tumorigenesis [48]. In a recent report, the role of
DARPP-32 and t-DARPP in breast tumorigenesis was
investigated in a mouse mammary tumor model [49]. In
contrast to DARPP-32, which was expressed in normal
mouse mammary tissue and in some tumors, t-DARPP
was exclusively expressed in tumors at equal or higher
levels than DARPP-32, suggesting that t-DARPP plays
a predominant role in breast tumorigenesis. Notably,

DARPP-32 proteins in cancer cell survival and
drug resistance
An initial report demonstrated that DARPP-32
proteins could protect cancer cells against drug-induced
apoptosis. This was particularly evident in studies
where both DARPP-32 and t-DARPP protected gastric
cancer cells against camptothecin, sodium butyrate, and
ceramide treatments in a p53-independent mechanism
[39]. Expression of DARPP-32 and t-DARPP preserved
the mitochondrial transmembrane potential in response
to camptothecin, and this was associated with increased
levels of Bcl2 protein [39]. Notably, the pro-survival
function of both DARPP-32 and t-DARPP depends on
Thr-75 phosphorylation residue [39]. A subsequent study
indicated that the pro-survival function of t-DARPP
involves increased AKT kinase activity and high levels
of phospho-AKT (Ser-473) and phospho-GSK3β (Ser9) proteins in gastric cancer cells [50]. In addition, the
study demonstrated that t-DARPP activates CREB and
ATF-1 transcription factors, which bind to a CREB
response element (CRE) on Bcl2 promoter, in an AKTdependent mechanism, leading to up-regulation of Bcl2
expression and increased cell survival in response to

Figure 2: Genomic structure of DARPP-32 and its truncated isoform, t-DARPP. DARPP-32 and t-DARPP share identical

sequence from exon 2 to the 3’ end. Of note, exon 1 of t-DARPP is spliced from the intron 1 of DARPP-32. DARPP-32 (1,983 bp)
encodes 204 amino acids, whereas t-DARPP (1,502 bp) encodes 168-amino-acids protein. The major phosphorylation sites on the proteins
are indicated by T, threonine, and S, serine. DARPP-32 contains five phosphorylation sites at T34, S45, T75, S102, and S137, whereas
t-DARPP lacks the T34 phosphorylation site of DARPP-32. The scheme is based on [39].

ceramide [50]. A recent report indicated that DARPP-32
binds Bcl2 and calcineurin (CaN) in a complex with
inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (InsP3R, a ubiquitous
intracellular Ca2+ channel), which induces a negative
feedback loop that reduces Ca+2 release and apoptosis
by decreasing phosphorylation of InsP3R in chronic
lymphocytic leukemia cells [51]. The study concluded that
this mechanism involving DARPP-32 might be exploited
by Bcl2-overexpressing cancer cells to suppress apoptosis.
On the other hand, one study found that DARPP-32
reversed the multidrug resistance (MDR) of Adriamycin
(ADR)-resistant gastric adenocarcinoma cells (SGC7901/
ADR), as these cells were significantly sensitized to
vincristine, ADR, 5-fluorouacil, and cisplatin in response
to DARPP-32 up-regulation [52]. Based on a single
gastric cancer cell model, these controversial findings may
suggest cell type specificity.
In a study, the role of DARPP-32 in mediating
resistance to gefitinib, a small tyrosine kinase inhibitor
specific for EGFR, was investigated in gastric cancer.
The data demonstrated that DARPP-32 expression
blocks gefitinib-induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells.
This is accompanied with activation of AKT, increased
stability of the EGFR protein, and the colocalization
of DARPP-32 with EGFR in a complex with ERBB3
on the cell membrane [53]. Mechanistic investigations
concluded that DARPP-32 promotion of EGFR/ERBB3
protein interaction leads to EGFR phosphorylation and
activation of PI3K-AKT signaling, thereby increasing
cell survival and gefitinib resistance in gastric cancer
cells [53]. In a report, DARPP-32 was implicated in
mediating resistance to TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosisinducing ligand) in gastric cancer. The data indicated
that DARPP-32 expression suppresses TRAIL-induced
apoptosis, accompanied with reduced cytochrome c
release and activation of caspase-8, -9, and -3 in gastric
cancer cells [54]. Further investigations indicated that
DARPP-32 induces the expression of the pro-survival
Bcl-xL protein through activation of Src/STAT3 signaling.
In addition, DARPP-32 has been shown to prevent the
TRAIL-induced caspase-dependent cleavage of NFκBp65, thereby maintaining the activity of NF-κB activity
and the expression of its target, the pro-survival FLIPs
(FLICE-inhibitory protein). Together, the findings suggest
that DARPP-32 promotes TRAIL resistance whereby it
suppresses the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways
through regulation of Bcl-xL and FLIPs, respectively [54].
In a study, the role of t-DARPP in resistance to
trastuzumab (Herceptin), a monoclonal antibody against
ERBB2 receptor, was investigated in breast cancer
[55]. The data indicated that t-DARPP expression was
up-regulated in trastuzumab-resistant ERBB2-positive
breast cancer cells. Genetic knockdown of t-DARPP
sensitized these resistant cells to trastuzumab as indicated
by increased activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis.
Mechanistic studies demonstrated that t-DARPP was
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

associated with the chaperone heat shock protein 90
(HSP90) and ERBB2 in a protein complex, suggesting
that t-DARPP mediates trastuzumab resistance through
regulation of ERBB2 receptor in trastuzumab-resistant
breast cancer cells [55]. A subsequent study confirmed
that t-DARPP overexpression was associated with
AKT activation and trastuzumab resistance in breast
cancer cells [56]. The findings indicated that t-DARPP
overexpression and Thr-75 t-DARPP residue are essential
for AKT activation and trastuzumab resistance in these
cells. In addition, the study showed that DARPP-32
promotes resistance to trastuzumab, and overexpression
of DARPP32 is associated with poor prognosis in breast
cancer [56]. However, another study indicated that
t-DARPP, but not DARPP-32, was overexpressed in a
trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells, and demonstrated
that t-DARPP overexpression was sufficient to confer
resistance to trastuzumab and suppress trastuzumabmediated dephosphorylation of AKT in sensitive breast
cancer cells [42]. A recent study has shown that t-DARPP
overexpression in HER2-positive breast cancer confers a
survival advantage to cancer cells in response to lapatinib
by suppressing lapatinib-induced BIM accumulation
[40]. A related report indicated that t-DARPP promotes
trastuzumab resistance through regulation of ERBB2
receptor in esophageal adenocarcinoma [57]. In fact,
t-DARPP was shown to counteract trastuzumab-induced
apoptosis, inhibit activation of caspase-3, and suppress
trastuzumab-induced dephosphorylation of ERBB2 and
AKT proteins. However, knockdown of endogenous
t-DARPP reversed these effects and sensitized cells to
trastuzumab. The findings from this study also indicated
that t-DARPP associates with ERBB2, thus increasing
its protein stability and interfering with the binding of
trastuzumab with the ERBB2 receptor in esophageal
adenocarcinoma cells [57].

DARPP-32 proteins in cancer cell growth and
proliferation
A study demonstrated mRNA overexpression
of t-DARPP in 36% of breast cancers, predominantly
observed in invasive ductal and intraductal carcinomas,
as opposed to absent to very low t-DARPP expression in
normal mammary tissue. Similarly, protein overexpression
of DARPP-32/t-DARPP was observed in 35.5% of
primary breast tumors, including invasive ductal
carcinomas (43.7%) [41]. In vitro studies demonstrated
that the overexpression of t-DARPP promotes cell
proliferation associated with induction of phosphorylation
of AKT (Ser-473) and its target GSK-3β (Ser-9) in breast
cancer cells. The knockdown of endogenous t-DARPP or
inhibition of PI3K reversed these effects, suggesting that
the pro-growth function of t-DARPP depends on PI3K in
breast cancer [41]. In a related study, the role of t-DARPP

in regulating β-catenin signaling and proliferation was
examined in upper gastrointestinal cancer cells [58]. The
data indicated that the expression of t-DARPP increased
cell proliferation and led to activation of β-catenin through
phosphorylation of AKT (Ser-473) and GSK-3β (Ser-9) in
a PI3K-dependent mechanism [58].

elevation, leading to activation of PKA, phosphorylation
of Thr-34-DARPP-32, and inhibition of cell migration.
Further studies demonstrated that the inhibition of PP1
by phospho-Thr-34-DARPP-32 potentiated the Wnt5a-mediated phosphorylation of CREB, a known PP1
substrate. Additionally, inhibition of the Wnt-5a-DARPP32-CREB pathway, by expression of dominant negative
CREB, reduced the anti-migratory effect of DARPP-32
in response to Wnt-5a [60]. On the other hand, another
study showed that DARPP-32 overexpression promotes
gastric cancer cell invasion [61]. The pro-invasive
function of DARPP-32 was associated with an increase
in the expression of the membrane-type 1 matrix
metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) and CXC-chemokine
receptor 4 (CXCR4) proteins. Consistent with the role of
MT1-MMP in activating MMPs, a substantial increase in
MMP-2 activity was detected in DARPP-32-expressing
cells. Inhibition or knockdown of CXCR4 suppressed
DARPP-32-induced cell invasion. Further mechanistic
studies showed that DARPP-32 and CXCR4 coexist in
the same protein complex, leading to increased stability
of CXCR4 protein because of reduced ubiquitination,
following treatment with its ligand, CXCL12. These
findings demonstrate that DARPP-32 enhances gastric
cancer cell invasion by regulating CXCR4-mediated
activation of the MT1-MMP/MMP2 pathway [61]. A

DARPP-32 in cancer cell migration, invasion, and
angiogenesis
A report indicated that overexpression of
DARPP-32 in breast cancer cells that express DDR1,
a receptor tyrosine kinase, significantly impaired cell
migration. However, DARPP-32 expression in DDR1deficient cells had no effect on migration [59]. It was
demonstrated that DDR1 associates with DARPP-32
in a protein complex, which regulates migration, and
the phosphorylation of Thr-34 residue is required for
DARPP-32 function to impair migration of breast cancer
cells. This was further supported using PKA inhibitors
that abrogated the anti-migratory effect of DARPP-32
[59]. A related study investigated the role of the Wnt-5a
signaling pathway in regulating DARPP-32-dependent
inhibition of migration in breast cancer cells [60]. The
study indicated that recombinant Wnt-5a induced cAMP

CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES

prospective pilot study, using clinical and histopathological
data of 100 patients with colorectal cancer between 1994
and 1997, revealed that DARPP-32 was highly expressed
in patients with distant metastases, relative to patients
without distant metastases. Further analysis indicated that
DARPP-32 expression in primary colorectal tumors was
a significant predictor of distant metastases, and could be
a potential marker of poor prognosis [62]. A recent report
indicated that DARPP-32 promotes angiogenesis through
regulation of angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2) in gastric cancer
[63]. In fact, DARPP-32 or t-DARPP positively regulates
mRNA and protein expression and secretion of ANGPT2
in gastric cancer cells, thereby inducing angiogenesis.
Further mechanistic investigations confirmed the role of
ANGPT2 in mediating DARPP-32-induced angiogenesis,
and revealed that DARPP-32 proteins regulate ANGPT2
expression through activation of STAT3. Notably,
DARPP-32 induces ANGPT2 expression in human gastric
tumor epithelial cells, but not in tumor associated vascular
endothelial cells [63]. A schematic diagram summarizing
DARPP-32-regulated signaling pathways involved in
tumorigenesis is shown in Figure 3.

A large body of research over the last three
decades has established DARPP-32 as a major
integrator of neurotransmission by dopamine and other
neurotransmitters in response to drugs of abuse or
psychostimulants. Additionally, several recent reports
implicated DARPP-32 and t-DARPP proteins in CNS
disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. The role of
DARPP-32 proteins in tumorigenesis and drug resistance
has been recently recognized and is a growing field of
investigations that continue to unveil new functions of
DARPP-32 (Figure 4). Collectively, the findings from
the published reports strongly suggest that DARPP-32
proteins have potential as a biomarker of drug resistance
or a therapeutic target in gastric cancer and other
malignancies. In the era of personalized cancer medicine,
it is imperative that future investigations and efforts
align together for the development and testing specific
pharmacological inhibitors that target DARPP-32 and its
signaling pathways in preclinical and clinical settings.

DARPP-32 promotes cancer cell proliferation, survival, invasion and metastasis, and angiogenesis. Each DARPP-32-mediated function
involves regulation of corresponding signaling pathways depicted in the schematic diagram.
