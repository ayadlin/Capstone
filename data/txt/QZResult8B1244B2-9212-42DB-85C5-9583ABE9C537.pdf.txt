Abstract
Human BRAF-driven tumors are aggressive malignancies with poor clinical outcome and lack of sensitivity to
therapies. TRAP1 is a HSP90 molecular chaperone deregulated in human tumors and responsible for speciﬁc
features of cancer cells, i.e., protection from apoptosis, drug resistance, metabolic regulation, and protein quality
control/ubiquitination. The hypothesis that TRAP1 plays a regulatory function on the BRAF pathway, arising from
the observation that BRAF levels are decreased upon TRAP1 interference, was tested in human breast and
colorectal carcinoma in vitro and in vivo. This study shows that TRAP1 is involved in the regulation of BRAF
synthesis/ubiquitination, without affecting its stability. Indeed, BRAF synthesis is facilitated in a TRAP1-rich
background, whereas increased ubiquitination occurs upon disruption of the TRAP1 network that correlates with
decreased protein levels. Remarkably, BRAF downstream pathway is modulated by TRAP1 regulatory activity:
indeed, TRAP1 silencing induces (i) ERK phosphorylation attenuation, (ii) cell-cycle inhibition with cell
accumulation in G0–G1 and G2–M transitions, and (iii) extensive reprogramming of gene expression. Interestingly,
a genome-wide proﬁling of TRAP1-knockdown cells identiﬁed cell growth and cell-cycle regulation as the most
signiﬁcant biofunctions controlled by the TRAP1 network. It is worth noting that TRAP1 regulation on BRAF is
conserved in human colorectal carcinomas, with the two proteins being frequently coexpressed. Finally, the dual
HSP90/TRAP1 inhibitor HSP990 showed activity against the TRAP1 network and high cytostatic potential in
BRAF-mutated colorectal carcinoma cells. Therefore, this novel TRAP1 function represents an attractive
therapeutic window to target dependency of BRAF-driven tumors on TRAP1 translational/quality control
machinery. Cancer Res; 74(22); 6693–704. 2014 AACR.

bearing BRAF mutations (1, 2), and occurring more frequently
in melanomas (40%–70%), and thyroid (36%–53%), colorectal
(5–22%), and low-grade ovarian serous (30%) carcinomas (3).
It is worth noting that deregulated BRAF signaling drives the
inappropriate activation of the downstream MEK–ERK pathway, thus leading to increased cellular growth, invasion, and
metastasis (4), as well as the activation of the NF-kB signaling
and Bcl-2, which are responsible for apoptosis inhibition (5). In
such a context, BRAF-driven tumor cells become addicted to
these deregulated signaling pathways, thereby constituting a
therapeutic window for tumor-selective targeting (3). This
issue is extremely relevant in the clinical setting as human
BRAF-driven tumors are frequently characterized by aggressive biologic behavior and resistance to apoptosis induced by
anticancer therapies (3).
Because HSP90 is the main molecular chaperone responsible
for BRAF folding, with speciﬁc afﬁnity greater for its mutated
form (6, 7), HSP90 targeting is presently evaluated as an antitumor strategy in human BRAF-mutated neoplasms (8). In such a
scenario, the characterization of novel mechanisms responsible
for the regulation of this oncogene and, thus, the identiﬁcation of

novel molecular targets for BRAF-mutated malignancies represent major clinical challenges, especially considering the lack of
effective treatments for these tumors (3). This issue is extremely
relevant in BRAF-driven colorectal carcinomas, which are characterized by high grade, mucinous histology, poor clinical outcome, and poor responsiveness to standard therapies, including
BRAF inhibitors and anti-EGFR1 agents (9).
TRAP1 is a molecular chaperone, belonging to the HSP90
chaperone family, which is upregulated in several human
malignancies, i.e., colorectal, breast, prostate, and lung
cancers (10–13). Initial studies demonstrated its involvement in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and regulating
the mitochondrial transition pore (MTP), via direct folding/
stability regulation on cyclophillin D and, likely, other
client proteins critical for MTP opening (11, 14, 15). More
recent evidence suggests that TRAP1 is responsible for
additional functions critical to tumor progression, such as
reprogramming of tumor cell metabolism (16, 17) and
extramitochondrial quality control regulation of speciﬁc
mitochondrial client proteins, most of which are key regulators of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (15, 18,
19, 20). In this context, previous data from our group
suggest that TRAP1 interacts with the regulatory protein
particle TBP7 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it
is involved in (i) quality control of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins through cotranslational regulation of
their ubiquitination/degradation (18, 20, 21), (ii) attenuation of global protein synthesis through activation of the
GCN2 and PERK kinase pathways, with consequent phosphorylation of eIF2a and attenuation of cap-dependent
translation (21), (iii) parallel enhancement of IRES-dependent translation, likely favoring synthesis of selective cancer-related genes (21), and (iv) consequent protection from
ER stress with parallel activation of a cytoprotective UPR
response (18, 20, 22).
Starting from our unpublished observation showing decreased BRAF protein levels in TRAP1-knockdown (KD) cells
and considering that (i) HSP90 chaperones are involved in
the regulation of BRAF stability (6, 7), (ii) TRAP1 is a HSP90
chaperone and key regulator of several process driving
tumor progression (11, 16, 17, 18, 22), and (iii) BRAF is an
intracellular kinase controlling tumor cell proliferation,
migration, and metastasis (3), we studied the relationship
between the TRAP1 network and the BRAF signaling pathway. Herein, we report that, in addition to HSP90 folding
regulation, BRAF is under additional control by TRAP1
translational/quality control machinery and that this regulation is relevant to BRAF-dependent control on ERK signaling and cell-cycle progression.

Materials and Methods
Tumor specimens and cell cultures
Specimens from 41 BRAF wild-type (wt) colorectal carcinomas and corresponding normal, noninﬁltrated peritumoral
mucosa were obtained from the General Surgery Unit of the
University of Foggia. Express written informed consent to
use biologic specimens for investigational procedures was

6694

obtained from all patients. Human breast carcinoma MCF7
and colorectal carcinoma HCT116, HT29, COLO320, and
COLO205 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cell lines were routinely monitored in
our laboratory by microscopic morphology, whereas cell line
authentication was veriﬁed by STR proﬁling in July 2013,
according to the ATCC product description.
RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). For ﬁrst-strand synthesis of cDNA, 1 mg of RNA was
used in a 20-mL reaction mixture using a Transcriptor First
Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche). For real-time PCR analysis, 0.5 ng of cDNA sample was ampliﬁed using the LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche) in a Light Cycler 480
(Roche). Primers are reported in Supplementary Methods.
Reaction conditions were as follows: preincubation at 95 C
for 5 minutes, followed by 45 cycles of 10 seconds at 95 C,
10 seconds at 60 C, and 10 seconds at 72 C. GAPDH was
chosen as an internal control.
Immunoblot analysis
Total cell lysates were obtained by the homogenization of
cell pellets and tissue samples in a cold lysis buffer (20 mmol/L
Tris, pH 7.5 containing 300 mmol/L sucrose, 60 mmol/L KCl, 15
mmol/L NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 1% (v/v)
Triton X-100, 1 mmol/L PMSF, 2 mg/mL aprotinin, 2 mg/mL
leupetin, and 0.2% (w/v) deoxycholate) for 2 minutes at 4 C
and further sonication for 30 seconds on ice. Mitochondria
were puriﬁed by the Qproteome Mitochondria Isolation kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoblot analysis was performed as previously reported (23).
Primary antibodies are reported in Supplementary Methods.
Where indicated, protein levels were quantiﬁed by densitometric analysis using the Quantity One 4.5 software (Bio-Rad
Laboratories GmbH).
Pulse–chase assay
Pulse–chase analysis was performed as described elsewhere
(24), with some modiﬁcations. In brief, 24 hours after transfection with cDNAs encoding for BRAF wild-type and V600Emutant tagged with Myc epitope, scramble and shTRAP1
HCT116 cells were incubated for 1 hour in a cysteine/methionine-free medium containing 100 mCi/mL 35S-labeled cysteine/methionine (GE Healthcare). After labeling, cells were
washed once with culture medium containing 10-fold excess
of unlabeled methionine and cysteine (5 mmol/L each), then
further incubated in the same medium for the indicated time
periods. Cells were collected at the indicated time points, with
immunoprecipitation performed on total protein lysates by
using anti-Myc antibody. The immunoprecipitates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a PVDF membrane
(Millipore), and analyzed by autoradiography, after which the
same ﬁlters were probed by immunoblot analysis.
Radiolabeled amino acid incorporation assay was performed by incubating cells for 1, 3, and 6 hours in a cysteine/
methionine-free medium containing 100 mCi/mL 35S-labeled
cysteine/methionine as described above.

TRAP1 Controls BRAF Synthesis and Cell-Cycle Progression

To determine whether TRAP1 control on BRAF was at the
transcriptional level, BRAF mRNA levels were analyzed by
quantitative RT-PCR in TRAP1-silenced cells compared with
their scramble controls. The unchanged mRNA levels
(Fig. 1D) along with the awareness that TRAP1 is a member
of the HSP90 molecular chaperone family, known to regulate
BRAF protein folding and stability (6), prompted us to
evaluate long-term BRAF protein stability by pulse–chase
experiments in TRAP1-interfered HCT116 cells (Fig. 2A).
Indeed, the half-lives of BRAF-wt and BRAF-V600E proteins
were comparable for up to 24 hours after the pulse in both
cell types (Fig. 2A), thus suggesting that TRAP1 does not
inﬂuence stability of BRAF within this time frame.
Previous observations by our group suggest that TRAP1 is
involved in cotranslational control of cancer cells through
(i) attenuation of Cap-dependent translation (18, 21), (ii)
preferential synthesis of selective cancer-speciﬁc genes (21),
and (iii) cotranslational ubiquitination/degradation of selective stress-protecting client proteins (18, 21). Because BRAF
stability is not affected by TRAP1, we tested the hypothesis that
BRAF is regulated at the translational level by measuring
radiolabeled amino acid incorporation in scramble/shTRAP1
HCT116 cells. Results show that scramble cells incorporate
more radiolabeled amino acids into both BRAF-wt and BRAFV600E proteins over time, compared with shTRAP1 cells

Cell-cycle analysis
Cells were incubated in a culture medium supplemented
with 20 mmol/L 5-bromo-20 -deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 20
minutes and harvested. Subsequent to incubation in a solution
containing 3 N HCl for 30 minutes at room temperature to
obtain DNA denaturation, cell pellets were further incubated in
the presence of anti-BrdUrd FITC (Becton Dickinson) for 1
hour at room temperature in the dark. After washing with PBS,
cells were further incubated with 6 mg/mL propidium iodate
(PI) for 20 minutes and then evaluated using FACSCalibur
(Becton Dickinson).

anti-MYC antibodies. A and B, densitometric band intensities, each normalized to the respective immunoprecipitate, were calculated by assuming
protein levels of the control (scramble cells at time 0) equal 1 and represents the mean values of three independent experiments ( SD).

(Fig. 2B). Because BRAF stability is unaffected by TRAP1, we
further evaluated whether the reduced protein levels of
BRAF in sh/siTRAP1 cell lines were dependent on increased
ubiquitination favored by the lack of TRAP1 quality control.
Accordingly, BRAF was immunoprecipitated from scramble
and shTRAP1 HCT116 cells (Fig. 3A) and HT29 cells after
TRAP1 transient silencing (Fig. 3B). Ubiquitin immunoblot
analysis of BRAF immunoprecipitates showed increased
levels of protein ubiquitination in TRAP1-interfered cells
despite overall reduction of total BRAF (Fig. 3A and B). In
parallel experiments, HCT116 cells were transfected with a
TBP7 deletion mutant unable to bind TRAP1, which behaves
as dominant negative over the TRAP1/TBP7 ubiquitination
control (18, 25). In line with data obtained upon TRAP1
silencing, ubiquitin immunoblot analysis of BRAF immunoprecipitates showed increased ubiquitin-conjugated proteins in cells transfected with the DTBP7 dominant-negative
mutant (Fig. 3C). Finally, to support further the hypothesis
that TRAP1 modulates BRAF synthesis/ubiquitination in the

6696

ER, shTRAP1 HCT116 cells were transfected with full-length
TRAP1 (Fig. 3D) or the D1–59TRAP1 deletion mutant (Fig.
3E), which lacks the mitochondrial targeting sequence and is
thus unable to enter into mitochondria, while still capable of
binding TBP7, modulating protein synthesis, and protecting
from ER stress (18, 20). Of note, either full-length TRAP1
(Fig. 3D) or the ER-associated D1–59TRAP1 deletion mutant
(Fig. 3E) rescued BRAF levels in shTRAP1 cells. Taken as a
whole, these observations suggest that TRAP1 control on
BRAF occurs in the extramitochondrial compartment and
that BRAF is among the genes whose synthesis is selectively
enhanced in a TRAP1-rich background, whereas its ubiquitination is enhanced in a TRAP1-low background.
BRAF downregulation upon TRAP1 silencing
correlates with attenuation of ERK signaling and

Because BRAF is responsible for the downstream activation of the MAPK pathway (3), we evaluated ERK1/2

Figure 3. ER-associated TRAP1 is responsible for the quality control/ubiquitination of BRAF. A and B, BRAF immunoprecipitates (IP) were obtained from
total cell lysates of scramble and shTRAP1 HCT116 cells transfected with MYC-tagged ubiquitin vector (Ub-MYC; A) and HT29 cells transfected with
negative or TRAP1 siRNA (B), both incubated with 10 mmol/L MG132 for 2 hours before cell lysis. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE
and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Input, total lysates from previously described cell lines were separated by SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotted with indicated antibodies. C, HCT116 cells were cotransfected with BRAF-wt or BRAF-V600E constructs and the DTBP7 deletion
mutant. Total lysates were quantiﬁed with an equal amount of each lysate immunoprecipitated with anti-MYC antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were
separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Input, total cell lysates from cells treated as in B were separated by SDSPAGE and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. A–C, densitometric band intensities are reported as ratios between ubiquitinated BRAF bands
and total BRAF in immunoprecipitates. D and E, total cell lysates from scramble and shTRAP1 HCT116 cells transfected with full-length TRAP1 cDNA

phosphorylation in a TRAP1-low background. In fact,
shTRAP1 MCF7 (Fig. 4A) and siTRAP1 COLO320 (Supplementary Fig. S1A) showed reduced activation of ERK1/2
phosphorylation upon serum stimulation compared with
control scramble cells. The close relationship between BRAF
control by TRAP1 and activation of MAPK signaling was
further investigated by transfecting BRAF-wt and BRAFV600E constructs in both scramble and shTRAP1 MCF7
cells; accordingly, reduced expression of BRAF-wt and
BRAF-V600E and ERK1/2 phosphorylation was observed in
TRAP1-silenced cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Furthermore, as for the rescue of BRAF levels (Fig. 3E), reexpression
of the D1–59TRAP1 deletion mutant in shTRAP1 HCT116

cells analogously restored ERK phosphorylation in parallel
with BRAF reexpression (Fig. 4B).
Because ERK signaling is known to induce cell-cycle
progression (26), we questioned the ability of TRAP1
silencing to block cell proliferation. Indeed, TRAP1-interfered MCF7 cells decreased the percentage of cells in the
S-phase of the cell cycle, with parallel upregulation of
cells in G0–G1 and G2–M transitions (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S1C). It is worth noting the ability of TRAP1 to
inhibit ERK phosphorylation and progression through the
S phase, observed upon transient TRAP1 silencing in
BRAF-wt HCT116 (Fig. 4D) and COLO320 (Supplementary
Fig. S1D), as well as in BRAF-V600E HT29 (Fig. 4E) cells,

function.
TRAP1 silencing results in extensive reprogramming of
gene expression involving genes responsible for cellcycle progression
Because RAF–ERK signaling is responsible for the transcriptional regulation of several genes involved in the progression of
the cell cycle (27), we performed full-genome gene expression
proﬁling of scramble and shTRAP1 HCT116 cells, which
allowed for the identiﬁcation of 504 genes signiﬁcantly modulated in TRAP1-silenced cells (P < 0.001), 246 up- and 258
downregulated (Supplementary Table S1). Gene ontology
(GO) analysis identiﬁed several GO categories linked to genes
modulated in our dataset, and, among others, cell cycle,
cell proliferation, and growth (Supplementary Fig. S2A). We
used the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software to identify
the biofunctions deregulated in TRAP1-silenced cells; it is
noteworthy that cell growth and proliferation and cell-cycle

regulation are among the top ﬁve predicted biofunctions (Fig.
5A). As these results were conﬁrmed by the FIDEA platform
(Supplementary Fig. S2B), we selected nine downregulated
genes with a cutoff value of <1.5, associated with cell-cycle
progression and identiﬁed by both bioinformatic platforms
(Table 1). In agreement with the role of TRAP1 in regulating
cell-cycle progression, these genes are all responsible for the
regulation of G0–G1 and/or G2–M transitions (28–35), with
most of them activated by ERK signaling (36). To validate the
microarray data, the expressions of eight of these genes were
analyzed by quantitative PCR and immunoblot analyses in
scramble/shTRAP1 HCT116 cells (Fig. 5 and Supplementary
Fig. S3, respectively); in actual fact, six of these genes were
conﬁrmed to be signiﬁcantly downregulated upon TRAP1
stable silencing by quantitative PCR (Fig. 5B). GAS6 was not
further evaluated, as its expression levels were undetectable in
the majority of our cell models. The relevance of the results
shown in Fig. 5B was further supported by analogous downregulation of the same genes in HCT116 cells upon transient

TRAP1 (Fig. 5C) or BRAF (Fig. 5D) silencing, as well as by the
downregulation of ﬁve of these genes in BRAF-V600E HT29
cells silenced for TRAP1 (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Conversely,
high BRAF and pERK levels and increased expression of the
same previously validated genes were found in HCT116 cells
transfected with TRAP1 cDNA (Fig. 5E). Taken as a whole, these
data suggest that the reprogramming of gene expression
induced by TRAP1 silencing is at least partially dependent on
TRAP1 regulation of RAF–ERK signaling. Immunoblot analysis
conﬁrmed the downregulation of CCNE1, PBK, TFDP1, and
NEK6 in HCT116 and HT29 cells upon TRAP1 silencing (Supplementary Fig. S3A), as well as the upregulation of the same
genes upon TRAP1 upregulation (Supplementary Fig. S3B). To
further study the contribution of the above genes to TRAP1dependent regulation of cells growth, cell-cycle distribution
was further evaluated in HCT116 cells silenced for these genes.

The independent silencing of each of these genes induced a
signiﬁcant attenuation of S phase, with arrest of cells in the G2
–M phase upon TFDP1 and PBK silencing, and arrest in G0–G1
phase upon CCNE1 and NEK6 interference. Of note, the
simultaneous silencing of all these genes signiﬁcantly inhibited
S phase with cell-cycle arrest in both G0–G1 and G2–M phases,
thus reproducing the phenotype obtained upon TRAP1 silencing (Supplementary Fig. S3C).
TRAP1 and BRAF are coexpressed in human colorectal
carcinomas and human BRAF V600E colorectal

(Figs. 2 and 3), the relevance of this mechanism was further
evaluated in human malignancies. Accordingly, BRAF protein

expression was assessed in a cohort of 41 BRAF-wt colorectal
carcinomas previously characterized for TRAP1 expression
and subdivided in TRAP1-positive (21 tumors) and TRAP1negative (20 tumors; Fig. 6A). Interestingly, a statistically
signiﬁcant coexpression between the two proteins was
observed (x2 test, P ¼ 0.018; Fig. 6B and Supplementary Table
S2), thus suggesting that TRAP1-dependent control on BRAF is
conserved in human colorectal carcinomas.
Finally, the issue of TRAP1 targeting was evaluated as a
novel therapeutic strategy in human BRAF-mutated colorectal carcinoma cells, known to be addicted on the RAF–
RAS–ERK pathway for their proliferative potential (3). This
approach was tested at the preclinical level by using two
ATPase inhibitors, HSP990 and AUY922, both of which are
described to bind the ATPase domain of TRAP1 in addition
to HSP90 (37, 38). Interestingly, only HSP990 exhibited
signiﬁcant activity against TRAP1 and TRAP1 translational
regulatory apparatus in our experimental models. Indeed,
HSP990 (i) downregulated speciﬁc TRAP1 interactors such
as the 18-kDa isoform of sorcin (Supplementary Fig. S4A;
ref. 15) and eEF1G, eIF4A, eIF4E, members of the translational machinery involved in TRAP1-dependent modulation
of protein synthesis (Supplementary Fig. S4B; ref. 21), (ii)
inhibited eI2Fa phosphorylation (Fig. 6C), a master regulator of protein synthesis whose phosphorylation status
decreased upon TRAP1 silencing, as shown in our previous
studies (21), and (iii) induced increased levels of protein
ubiquitination (Fig. 6C). Remarkably, short exposure of
HT29 cells to HSP990 increased BRAF ubiquitination (Fig.
6D), whereas prolonged exposure to the dual TRAP1/HSP90
inhibitor yielded a signiﬁcant downregulation of BRAF
expression and ERK phosphorylation, more evident in the
BRAF-V600E colorectal carcinoma cell lines (Fig. 6E). Conversely, AUY922 exhibited minimal degrading activity
against BRAF, while still being active on HSP90, as demonstrated by AKT degradation (Fig. 6E). Consistently, HSP990
showed high cytostatic activity in human BRAF V600E HT29
cells, and was active in inhibiting either cell-cycle progression (Fig. 6F) or cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S4C)

6700

Cancer Res; 74(22) November 15, 2014

at concentrations 10-times higher than AUY922 (Fig. 6F).
In contrast, HSP990 induced signiﬁcant levels of apoptosis
only at concentrations above 100 nmol/L, being AUY922
inactive in inducing cell death in this concentration range
(Supplementary Fig. S4D). These data strongly suggest that
the TRAP1 translational machinery deserves evaluation as a
novel molecular target in human BRAF-mutated colorectal
carcinomas.

Discussion
BRAF is one of the top 12 mutant genes, showing around
8% of mutation frequency in human tumors (39). Likewise,
human BRAF-driven malignancies are highly aggressive
tumors, resistant to anticancer therapies and, frequently, with
a poor outcome (3). Thus, novel targeted therapeutic strategies
are urgently needed to affect molecular mechanisms driving
tumor progression and responsible for the aggressive behavior
of these malignancies.
This study provides a strong molecular rationale to candidate TRAP1 network as a novel target in colorectal BRAFdriven tumors. Indeed, starting from the well-known observation that HSP90 is the molecular chaperone responsible for
BRAF stability and folding (6), as well as from our unpublished
data suggesting that BRAF is downregulated in TRAP1silenced cells, here we show that BRAF is under the control
of TRAP1 translational quality control machinery, as an additional, nonredundant mechanism responsible for regulating
BRAF activity/synthesis in tumor cells. Seen in this light,
although HSP90 is responsible for direct folding regulation on
BRAF (6), our data suggest that TRAP1 regulates BRAF synthesis/ubiquitination at translational levels. A number of
observations support this conclusion: (i) BRAF protein levels
are signiﬁcantly attenuated in TRAP1-silenced cells with no
effect on its mRNA levels and long-term stability, (ii) BRAF
protein synthesis is facilitated in a TRAP1-high background, (iii) BRAF ubiquitination is increased upon TRAP1
silencing and after disruption of the ER-associated TRAP1/
TBP7 quality control network, and (iv) BRAF protein levels

are restored under the reexpression of a TRAP1-mutant whose
activity is restricted to ER and retains TRAP1 quality control
function (18, 20).
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst evidence that TRAP1
quality control function is not restricted to nuclear-encoded
mitochondria-destined proteins (18, 20). Indeed, recent studies
by our group demonstrated that TRAP1 is responsible for the
attenuation of cap-dependent translation, favoring the IRESdependent version, and that, upon TRAP1 silencing, speciﬁc
TRAP1 client proteins (i.e., 18-kDa Sorcin and F1ATPase) are
downregulated at the protein level through cotranslational
ubiquitination (18, 21). Critical for this extramitochondrial
function of TRAP1 is the interaction with TBP7, an AAAATPase of the 19S proteasomal subunit (18). Remarkably,

www.aacrjournals.org

TRAP1 and TBP7 are both upregulated in human colorectal
tumors, thus suggesting the relevance of this pathway in vivo
(18). In such a perspective, the enrichment of the list of
TRAP1-regulated proteins, which remarkably includes a key
oncogene driving tumor progression in human malignancies,
further highlights the relevance of the TRAP1 quality control
pathway in favoring and maintaining the malignant phenotype
in human tumors. Indeed, the molecular characterization of
human colorectal carcinomas allowed us to demonstrate that
TRAP1 is coexpressed with BRAF (Fig. 6) and other TRAP1
client proteins, beyond TBP7 (18, 21), thus suggesting both that
selected human malignancies are likely to be dependent on
TRAP1 translational quality control network for their survival,
proliferation, and migration (18, 21), and that this mechanism

probably favors their growth indeﬁnitely and protects from
apoptotic cell death even under unfavorable environments. In
such a scenario, the TRAP1 network is emerging as a key
element in the ER protein quality control apparatus and as a
relevant component of the adaptive stress response pathway of
cancer cells aimed at maintaining proteostasis and, consequently, gaining a survival advantage (40).
This working hypothesis is consistent with the evidence
that TRAP1 regulation on BRAF synthesis/ubiquitination
affects speciﬁc features of BRAF-driven tumor cells, i.e., the
downstream ERK signaling pathway, cell-cycle progression,
and gene expression. Indeed, TRAP1 silencing results in the
attenuation of ERK phosphorylation and progression of cell
cycle with accumulation of cells in the G0–G1 and/or G2–M
checkpoints.
Furthermore, the whole-genome expression analysis of
shTRAP1 colorectal carcinoma cells provides evidence that
the attenuation of RAF–ERK signaling correlates with wide
reprogramming of gene expression affecting several functions central to tumor progression, such as regulation of cell
metabolism and apoptosis, organization of cell components
and location, cell communication, and regulation of multicellular and multiorganism processes. While several of these
predicted functions are consistent with TRAP1 literature
(10, 11, 14–18, 41, 42), it is worth noting that analysis of our
dataset highlights the regulation of cell-cycle progression as
the top biofunction, identifying several cell cycle–regulatory
genes whose expression is reduced, most of them under the
control of ERK signaling (26). Furthermore, six of these
genes were signiﬁcantly downregulated in colorectal carcinoma cell lines in conditions of TRAP1 or BRAF silencing
and upregulated in parallel to BRAF and ERK phosphorylation on TRAP1 transfection, thus supporting the role of
TRAP1 in controlling a network of genes involved in the
regulation of cell proliferation through its modulation on
RAS–ERK signaling (Supplementary Fig. S5). Remarkably,
the silencing of four of these genes reproduced the inhibitory
phenotype of cell-cycle progression obtained upon TRAP1
interference.
These ﬁndings are consistent with the initial identiﬁcation
of TRAP1 as a molecular chaperone interacting with Rb protein
during mitosis and after heat shock (41) and are in agreement
with the microarray data by Liu and colleagues, showing that
TRAP1 may control cell proliferation by promoting genes
encoding for G protein–coupled receptors, and cell adhesion
and Rho-kinase pathway proteins (36). Furthermore, recent
observations suggest that TRAP1 knockdown reduces cell
growth and clonogenic cell survival in lung carcinoma cells
(13), whereas TRAP1 upregulation increases ERK phosphorylation in mice ﬁbroblast (43). Finally, the relevance of this
mechanism in tumor cell growth is strongly supported by our
previous observation that TRAP1 KD cells are not tumorigenic
either in vitro or in vivo (17).
These results provide a strong molecular rationale for
evaluating TRAP1 quality control machinery as a novel
target in BRAF-driven tumors with a view toward the development of speciﬁc therapeutic strategies to inhibit a mechanism relevant for maintenance of the malignant phenotype.

Cancer Res; 74(22) November 15, 2014

Indeed, the coexpression between TRAP1 and BRAF and
other TRAP1 client proteins in human colorectal carcinomas
(18, 20, 21) supports the relevance of TRAP1 cotranslational
regulation in human pathology. Furthermore, here, we demonstrate that HSP990, an HSP90 inhibitor previously hypothesized as inhibiting TRAP1 based on in vitro binding
data (38), showed the capacity to downregulate speciﬁc
TRAP1-interacting proteins (21), inhibit eIF2a, a master
regulator of protein synthesis (21), and enhance BRAF ubiquitination, thus opening new perspectives in the development of TRAP1-targeted therapies. Indeed, HSP990 induced
a signiﬁcant downregulation of BRAF protein expression
in colorectal carcinoma cell lines and showed a potent
cytostatic activity in BRAF-mutated colorectal carcinoma
cells, providing evidence for the concept that TRAP1-dependent translational/quality control machinery represents a
potentially attractive target to develop novel anticancer
inhibitors, opening a new window for a compartmentalized
(ER versus mitochondria) and network-directed therapeutic
strategy in BRAF-driven colorectal carcinomas.
In this perspective, the evidence that BRAF protein
expression is under the control of TRAP1 quality control
machinery ideally candidates human BRAF-driven tumors
for TRAP1-directed therapy. It follows that new studies
are needed to design and develop speciﬁc anti-TRAP1
inhibitors to target TRAP1 function directly in the ER,
most likely with a reduced toxicity proﬁle compared with
HSP90 inhibitors presently under preclinical and clinical
development (38).
This issue is extremely relevant in human BRAF-mutated
colorectal carcinomas, characterized by an aggressive biologic
and clinical behavior and a dismal prognosis (5). These malignancies represent, at present, a real clinical challenge as they
are insensitive to both traditional chemotherapeutics and
new anti-EGFR agents (44). Although recent ﬁndings suggest
that only the combination of a triple chemotherapy regimen
(i.e., 5-ﬂuorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) with the
anti-VEGF agent, bevacizumab, may affect the progression of
BRAF-mutated metastatic colorectal carcinomas (45), our
data provide a strong rationale for the evaluation of TRAP1targeting agents in these tumors.
