BACKGROUND: A prognostic model based on clinical parameters for nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients treated with gefitinib (250 mg/day) as a salvage therapy was devised. METHODS: Clinical data
regarding a total of 316 metastatic or recurrent NSCLC patients who were treated with gefitinib were analyzed. RESULTS: Poor prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) by multivariate analysis were an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2 to 3 (hazards ratio [HR] of 2.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.57-2.73 [P < .001]), the presence of intra-abdominal metastasis (HR of 1.76; 95% CI,
1.33-2.34 [P < .001]), elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (HR of 1.50; 95% CI, 1.13-2.00 [P ¼ .005]), time
interval from diagnosis to gefitinib therapy of 12 months (HR of 1.48; 95% CI, 1.12-1.95 [P ¼ .005]), low serum albumin (HR of 1.45; 95% CI, 1.09-1.92 [P ¼ .009]), progression-free interval for previous chemotherapy
of 12 weeks (HR of 1.40; 95% CI, 1.0-1.84 [P ¼ .015]), white blood cell >10,000/lL (HR of 1.38; 95% CI, 1.021.85 [P ¼ .032]), and ever-smoker (HR of 1.33; 95% CI, 1.02-1.75 [P ¼ .033]). Of the 272 patients applicable
to this prognostic model, 41 patients (15%) were categorized as a good prognosis group (0-1 risk factors),
100 patients (37%) as an intermediate prognosis group (2-3 risk factors), 81 patients (30%) as a poor prognosis group (4-5 risk factors), and 50 patients (16%) as a very poor prognosis group (6 risk factors). The
median OS from the time of gefitinib treatment for the good, intermediate, poor, and very poor prognosis
groups were 18.0 months, 11.2 months, 4.0 months, and 1.3 months, respectively (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS:
This prognostic model based on easily available clinical variables would be useful to identify patients who
might derive more benefit from gefitinib treatment and to make decisions in clinical practice. Cancer

made, the survival of patients with advanced NSCLC
remains poor, with a median survival of 6 months to 12
months and 1-year survival rates between 20% and
50%.2-5
During the past few years, the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) has emerged as 1 of the most
important targets for drug development in lung cancer.
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have provided
an important alternative approach for the palliation of
previously treated patients with advanced NSCLC.6,7
Gefitinib is an orally active small-molecule compound
that inhibits the EGFR tyrosine kinase by competing
with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) at the ATP-binding
site and prevents ligand-induced phosphorylation and
downstream signaling. Although a placebo-controlled
phase 3 study (ISEL) in previously treated patients with
NSCLC failed to demonstrate significant survival benefit in gefitinib group, preplanned subgroup analysis
suggested survival benefits in Asian patients and neversmokers.8 The results of several previous studies indicate
that a different subset of patients will have different
degrees of benefit from treatment with EGFR TKIs.9
Therefore, it is imperative to identify a subset of patients
who are most likely to benefit from treatment with
EGFR TKIs.
There is increasing evidence that several molecular
biomarkers such as EGFR mutations10-14 and high EGFR
gene copy number15 could be predictive of higher
response rates and longer survival in patients treated with
EGFR TKIs. In contrast, resistance to the therapy and
unfavorable clinical outcome were associated with
patients whose tumors contained k-ras mutations.16,17
Unfortunately, it is not always possible to obtain
adequate tissue samples from advanced NSCLC patients
for molecular analyses, and more data are required in
terms of the reliability and standardization of the molecular assays to be routinely used in clinics. Moreover,
approximately 1 to 3 weeks are required for the confirmation of such molecular profiles, necessitating a wait-time
before treatment. Therefore, a simple prognostic model to
predict outcome with easily available clinical variables
may assist clinicians in selecting those patients with
NSCLC who will derive more clinical benefit from treatment with EGFR TKIs.
In the current study, we developed a prognostic
model based on the clinical and laboratory parameters to

predict outcome in NSCLC patients treated with gefitinib
as a salvage treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Data Collection
We collected the clinical and laboratory data of 358 consecutive patients with metastatic or recurrent NSCLC
who had been treated with gefinitib (at a dose of 250
mg/day) from the database at Samsung Medical Center
between January 2002 and December 2005. There were
23 patients who underwent gefitinib (250 mg/day) therapy as first-line treatment who were excluded from the
analysis. An additional 13 patients having the following
criteria were excluded: severe or uncontrolled systemic
disease, active infection, concomitant malignancy or a second primary malignancy except for in situ carcinoma of
the cervix or adequately treated basal cell carcinoma of the
skin, clinically active interstitial lung disease, recent myocardial infarction, or unstable angina. Another 6 patients
with progressive and uncontrolled brain metastasis were
also excluded from the analysis. However, patients with
asymptomatic brain metastases and patients with stable or
controlled brain metastasis who underwent whole–brain
radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery were not
excluded.
Clinical parameters studied at the time of the initiation of gefitinib treatment were as follows: age, sex,
smoking history, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status (PS), histology, number of
prior systemic chemotherapies, stage, time interval from
diagnosis to gefitinib therapy, progression-free interval for
previous chemotherapy, and sites of metastasis. Metastatic
sites were divided into 5 regions, as follows: 1) central
nervous system (CNS) including the brain, spinal cord,
and leptomeninges; 2) lung to lung including contralateral the lung and ipsilateral 1 of different lobe; 3) intraabdomen including the liver, spleen, adrenal gland, intraabdominal lymph nodes, and peritoneum; 4) bone; and
5) skin/soft tissues.
Laboratory findings studied within 2 weeks before
the initiation of gefitinib therapy were as follows: white
blood cells (WBCs), hemoglobin, platelets, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), serum albumin, total

bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine
(Cr), serum sodium, serum potassium, and serum calcium. The serum sodium and potassium levels were not
available in 11 patients. The serum level of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) within 3 months before the initiation
of gefitinib was used in the analysis, and was not available
in 28 patients. Response evaluation to gefitinib (250 mg/
day) therapy was conducted according to the Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
guidelines.

Statistical Analysis
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall
survival (OS). OS was defined as the time between the beginning of the gefinitib treatment and death from any
cause. The date of diagnosis was defined as the date when
the lung cancer was pathologically confirmed. In patients
who underwent surgery or concurrent chemoradiation
therapy with curative intent, the date of diagnosis was
defined as the date when the recurrence of lung cancer was
verified. Laboratory variables were initially recorded as
continuous variables and later dichotomized for the ease
of statistical analysis and clinical application. The cutoff
values of laboratory variables were determined based on
the standards of the Samsung Medical Center Reference
Laboratory for WBC, hemoglobin, platelets, AST, ALT,
ALP, serum albumin, total bilirubin, serum BUN, serum
Cr, serum sodium, serum potassium, serum calcium, and
CEA. The cutoff value for hemoglobin was chosen as 11
g/dL because below that level, further evaluation and
management of anemia are necessary according to the
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)
Cancer and Treatment-Related Anemia Guidelines.18
The log-rank test was used to compare the survival
of different groups. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used in univariate and multivariate analyses to identify the most significant prognostic factors for
survival and to calculate hazards ratios (HRs) of death and
95% confidence intervals for the ratio. Significant prognostic variables in univariate analysis were included in
multivariate analyses as follows: sex (male vs female),
ECOG PS (ECOG 0-1 vs 2-3), smoking status (eversmokers vs never-smokers), histology (adenocarcinoma vs
other histology), metastasis to intra-abdomen (yes vs no),
number of metastatic regions (0-2 vs 3 ), time interval

months), progression-free interval for previous chemotherapy ( >12 weeks vs 12 weeks), WBC (>10,000/ lL
vs 10,000/ lL), hemoglobin (11g/dL vs <11g/dL),
platelets (350,000 vs <350,000), serum ALP (> within
normal limit [WNL] vs WNL), total bilirubin (>WNL
vs WNL), serum sodium (abnormal vs normal), and serum calcium (abnormal vs normal). Of 316 patients, 53
patients were not included in the Cox regression model:
38 patients with unknown PS, 6 patients with unknown
smoking status, and 9 patients with unknown serum sodium level at the time of gefitinib therapy. Therefore, 263
patients were evaluable on multivariate analysis for overall
survival. The Cox regression model was created using a
stepwise backward conditional procedure, and probability
was set at 0.05 for entry and 0.10 for removal. The HR of
a death was calculated, along with the 95% confidence
interval (95% CI) for the ratio. A P value <.05 was considered statistically significant.

Establishment of the Prognostic Model
Based on the multivariate analysis, we devised a prognostic model to predict outcome in patients with metastatic
or recurrent NSCLC who were treated with gefitinib (250
mg/day) as a salvage therapy using the following variables:
ECOG PS (2-3 vs 0-1), intra-abdominal metastasis (presence vs absence), serum ALP (elevated vs WNL), time
interval from diagnosis to gefitinib therapy (12 months
vs >12 months), serum albumin (<3.5 g/dL vs 3.5 g/
dL), WBC (>10,000/lL vs 10,000/lL), progressionfree interval for previous chemotherapy (12 weeks vs
>12 weeks), and smoking status (ever-smokers vs neversmokers).
When constructing the prognostic model, to each
variable we assigned the different weights from regression
coefficients from the Cox proportional hazards model for
the ease of clinical application. Risk scoring ¼ 2  (PS
[ECOG PS 2-3 vs ECOG PS 0-1]) þ 2  (intra-abdominal metastasis [presence vs absence]) þ 1.5  (serum ALP

Because a practical prognostic model should classify risk
groups effectively and clearly, we combined contiguous
risk groups into a few ones. Many combinations of grouping were attempted to find the best prognostic model.
Several examples are shown in Figure 1. The large number

the effectiveness of prognostic prediction. The prognostic
models with 8 (Fig. 1A), 6 (Fig. 1B), or 5 risk groups (Fig.
1C) did not discriminate OS between all risk groups. Of
several prognostic models of various combinations, the
prognostic model with 4 risk groups (Group 1, scoring 02; Group 2, scoring 3-5.5; Group 3, scoring 6-10.5; and
Group 4, 11-12.5) was the most optimal (Fig. 1D),
because it demonstrated significant differences in OS
between all risk groups (Group 1 vs Group 2, P ¼ .007;

Group 2 vs Group 3, P < .001; and Group 3 vs Group 4,
P ¼ .031). However, in clinical practice, a simple prognostic model easy to apply could be much better if it had
similar predictive power. Therefore, we assigned the same
weight to each variable and devised a simpler prognostic
model. We also compared ‘same weight’ models with ‘different weight’ ones. The ‘same weight’ prognostic model
with 4 risk groups could be nearly as effective as the ‘different weight’ model in predicting prognosis in patients
with NSCLC who were treated with gefitinib (250 mg/
day) as a salvage therapy (Fig. 2B). Therefore, we adopted
the ‘same weight’ prognostic model in this study.

From January 2002 to December 2005, 316 patients with
metastatic or recurrent NSCLC were included in this
analysis. Baseline clinical characteristics at the time of gefitinib treatment were summarized in Table 1. The median
age of the patients was 59.0 years (range, 24 - 86 years),
and 209 (66%) were men. A total of 117 patients (37%)
had an ECOG PS of 0 to 1, and 106 patients (34%) had
an ECOG PS of 2. A total of 136 patients (43%) were
never-smokers, and 212 patients (67%) had adenocarcinoma histology. Two hundred twenty-nine patients
(72%) underwent 2 chemotherapy sessions before gefitinib treatment. Platinum-based doublet chemotherapy,
including paclitaxel, docetaxel, vinorelbine, and gemcitabine, was administered as a previous chemotherapy to 289
patients (92%). At the time of gefitinib therapy, a total of
256 patients (81%) had stage IV disease according to the
staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer. The median time interval from diagnosis to gefitinib
therapy was 11 months (range, 1.3 months to 75.3
months), and the median progression-free interval for previous chemotherapy was 11.3 weeks (range, 0.8 months
to 129 months). The overall response rate was 22% (95%
CI, 17.4-26.8), and disease control rate was 45% (95%
CI, 39.4-50.6). The baseline laboratory values at the start
of gefitinib therapy are shown in Table 2.
With a median follow-up of 47.4 months (range,
26.7- 73.3 months), 290 (92%) patients died of the disease. The median OS for 316 patients was 6.4 months,

Multivariate Analysis of Pretreatment
Factors for OS
Two hundred sixty-three patients were evaluable in multivariate analysis for OS from the time they were treated
with gefitinib. Independent poor prognostic factors found
to be significant for OS by multivariate analysis were as
follows: ECOG PS of 2 to 3 (HR of 2.08; 95% CI, 1.572.74 [P < .001]), presence of intra-abdominal metastasis
(HR of 1.77; 95% CI, 1.33-2.34 [P < .001]), elevated serum ALP (HR of 1.50; 95% CI, 1.13-2.00 [P ¼ .005]),
time interval from diagnosis to gefitinib therapy of 12
months (HR of 1.48; 95% CI, 1.13-1.95 [P ¼ .005]), serum albumin <3.5 g/dL (HR of 1.45; 95% CI, 1.10-1.93
[P ¼ .009]), progression-free interval for previous chemotherapy of 12 weeks (HR of 1.40; 95% CI, 1.07-1.84 [P

Validation of the Prognostic Model in an
Independent Cohort of NSCLC Patients
The prognostic value of gefitinib prognostic model was
tested in an independent cohort of 170 patients with
NSCLC who were treated with gefitinib (250 mg/day) as
a salvage therapy at Samsung Medical Center, Seoul,
Korea, between January 2006 and December 2007. We
retrieved the clinical data of these patients and applied the
prognostic model. Of 170 patients, 45 patients (26%), 71
patients (42%), 40 patients (24%), and 14 patients (8%)
were classified into the good, intermediate, poor, and very
poor prognosis groups, respectively. The median OS of
the good, intermediate, poor, and very poor prognosis
groups were 26.4 months (95% CI, 19.1 months -33.7
months), 14.2 months (95% CI, 9.6 months -18.8
months), 6.6 months (95% CI, 4.7 months -8.5 months),
and 0.8 months (95% CI, 0.5 months -1.0 months),
respectively (Fig. 3). The Kaplan-Meier survival curves
were well separated among each risk group (P < .001).

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we developed a new prognostic
model based on multiple clinical and laboratory variables

in an independent cohort of 170 patients with nonsmall cell
lung cancer who were treated with gefitinib as a salvage

model could be applicable to an independent cohort of Asian
patients and might be useful for predicting the outcome of
those patients, facilitating the risk-adapted therapy.

to predict survival outcome in patients with metastatic or
recurrent NSCLC after salvage gefitinib (250 mg/day)
therapy. Based on the 8 pretreatment prognostic factors
derived from multivariate analysis (ECOG PS of 2-3,
presence of intra-abdominal metastasis, elevated serum
ALP, time interval from diagnosis to gefitinib therapy of
12 months, serum albumin <3.5 g/dL, progression-free
interval for previous chemotherapy of 12 weeks, WBC
>10,000/lL, and current smoker or ever–smoker),
patients were categorized into 4 prognosis groups (good,
intermediate, poor, and very poor prognosis group).
Cancer

Gefitinib Prognostic Model in NSCLC/Park et al

Each prognostic group demonstrated a different risk
of death (P < .001) and the survival curve was definitely
separated among the groups. For patients with 0 to 1 risk
factor (good prognosis group), the median OS was 18.0
months, whereas patients with 6 risk factors (very poor
prognosis group) had only 1.3 months of survival.
Although previous studies suggested that several clinical
parameters may be important in selecting patients who
are likely to have a response to EGFR TKIs,8-17 to our
knowledge the clinical prognostic model in this group of
patients has not been studied to date. From a clinician’s
perspective, grouping patients into several categories with
respect to potential benefit from gefitinib treatment has
practical implications. In that sense, this prognostic
model, devised from easily available clinical variables at
the outpatient clinic might assist clinicians in efficiently
identifying patients who will likely benefit more from
gefitinib treatment.
Various molecular biomarkers including EGFR
mutations, high EGFR gene copy number, and k-ras
mutation appear to be promising in predicting response
rate and survival in NSCLC patients treated with gefitinib.9-17 However, the routine use of molecular predictive markers in the clinic in identifying favorable group
of patients for gefitinib treatment is still restricted owing
to limited amounts of tissue samples, a lack of reliable
molecular methods for complex analyses, and as–yet
imperfect standardization of the molecular methods.19
Therefore, a prognostic model with readily available
clinical variables may immediately assist clinicians in
selecting patients when considering gefitinib as a salvage
therapy.
According to this prognostic model, patients classified to the good prognosis group (n ¼ 41; 15%) had a
median OS of 18.0 months and a 1–year survival rate of
68%. Even in the intermediate group, which had 2 to 3
risk factors, the median survival was 11.2 months.
Given the median OS of 5.6 months for patients treated
with gefitinib in the ISEL study8 and 6.7 months
reported for patients treated with erlotinib in the BR.21
study,20 the prognosis of these groups of patients was
remarkably better. Based on our results, further prospective study will be needed to evaluate whether gefitinib treatment earlier in the course of disease rather than
cytotoxic chemotherapy can improve survival for
patients with a good prognosis.

Among the several clinical factors included in this
prognostic model, pretreatment PS was found to be the
strongest prognostic factor for survival. The median survival for patients with an ECOG PS of 2 to 3 was only 3.3
months. This result is consistent with previous studies
reporting that poor PS has been widely accepted as an
unfavorable prognostic factor for survival in most malignancies, including NSCLC.14,21-24
Liver metastasis has been reported to be an
independent poor prognostic factor in patients with
NSCLC.23,25 However, in the current study, the prognosis of patients with metastasis to other intra-abdominal
regions except the liver was as poor as that for patients
with liver metastasis (median survival of 3.4 months vs
2.8 months; P ¼ .581). Thus, we combined patients with
liver metastasis and those with other intra-abdominal
metastasis as a single group in the analysis. Beyond the
thoracic cavity, metastasis of lung cancer to the intraabdomen region may reflect advanced status or more
aggressive nature of the disease, which could confer poor
prognosis.
Smoking status is a well known prognostic factor
that was reported to predict response rate and clinical outcome in NSCLC patients treated with EGFR TKIs in
many studies.8,14,20,26 Smoking status also could be a surrogate marker of EGFR mutation status.14,27 Given that
never–smokers provided an independent prognostic factor in the current study, lung cancers arising in never–
smokers appear to have different epidemiologic, clinical,
and molecular features compared with those in smokers,
suggesting they are separate entities27 and might have a
different natural course and less aggressive behavior than
tumors diagnosed in smokers.27,28
Of interest, as pretreatment clinical features, time
interval from diagnosis to gefitinib therapy of <12
months, and progression-free interval for previous chemotherapy of <12 weeks were found to be significant factors
affecting survival in this prognostic model. Our results are
also consistent with previous reports.20,29 Thus, these
clinical features might be a surrogate of indolent or less
aggressive nature of lung cancer.
Several laboratory parameters, including an elevated
WBC, low serum albumin, and elevated ALP, provided
prognostic significance in this prognostic model. Pretreatment leukocytosis has been reported to be an independent
prognostic factor21,22,30 and may reflect a larger burden of
1527

Original Article

lung cancer cells or the effect of an as–yet unknown
inflammatory response related to malignancy. Low serum
albumin levels may indicate poor nutritional status, inadequate hepatic function, and protein wasting, which could
confer poor survival.31-33 Serum ALP has been validated
as an independent prognostic factor for survival in
patients with various cancers21,32,34-37 but the reason why
elevated ALP is associated significantly with poor survival
is to our knowledge not yet evident. Further investigation
should be necessary to clarify the prognostic role of ALP
in patients with NSCLC.
In NSCLC patients, brain metastasis has been considered as a poor prognostic factor in many previous
reports.22,23 Therefore, patients with brain metastasis
traditionally have been excluded from the majority of
NSCLC clinical trials. However, in this study, we
included the patients with asymptomatic brain metastases
and patients with stable or controlled brain metastasis.
The median OS of patients with metastasis to the CNS,
including brain, spine, and/or leptomeninges, was not
statistically different from that of those without CNS metastasis, which may be the result of improved survival by
stereotactic surgery and radiotherapy. In our database,
there were 6 patients who were treated with gefitinib as
salvage therapy but who had been excluded in the analysis
because they had uncontrolled and/or progressive brain
metastasis. However, the survival analysis including those
6 patients did not affect the results. Further analysis with
adequate number of patients with uncontrolled and/or
progressive CNS metastasis could confirm its prognostic
significance. However, the prognostic significance of
uncontrolled and/or progressive CNS metastasis could be
so powerful that it would weaken the prognostic impact
of other valuable clinical factors in the multivariate analysis. Therefore, the inclusion of all CNS metastases might
not be appropriate in devising the prognostic model.
For strengthening the reliability of model, we tested
the prognostic model in an independent cohort and
applied it to 170 NSCLC patients who were treated with
gefitinib (250 mg/day) as a salvage therapy between January 2006 and December 2007. Although the follow-up
period of the cohort was relatively short (median followup duration, 25.4 months) and the validated sample size
was not large, the separation of survival curves among 4
prognosis groups was distinct (Fig. 3). The validation of
our gefitinib prognostic model provides potential evi1528

dence that this model could be applied to other Asian
patients with NSCLC who are treated with gefitinib as a
salvage therapy for predicting the outcome.
Although we developed this prognostic model
through the integration of readily available clinical and
laboratory parameters to apply in clinical practice, retrospective nature of this analysis has limitations including
exclusion, selection, and recall biases. Furthermore, this
study was conducted in Korean patients with NSCLC
who were undergoing gefitinib treatment. Given the ethnic difference of gefitinib response and clinical benefit
from EGFR TKIs, the ethnicity should be considered
when applying the prognostic model. Therefore, whether
this prognostic model could be applied to Western
NSCLC patients remains to be determined and will
require further validation.
In conclusion, the prognostic model incorporating
8 pretreatment prognostic factors in NSCLC patients
undergoing salvage gefitinib (250 mg/day) treatment
markedly separated patients into 4 different risk groups.
This model might be helpful to clinicians when considering gefitinib as a salvage therapy in patients with NSCLC,
and it could facilitate risk-adapted therapy. Furthermore,
the correlation between the known molecular markers
and the clinical variables based on our data should be
actively researched.
