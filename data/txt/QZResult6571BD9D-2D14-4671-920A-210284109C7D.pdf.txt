ABSTRACT
The capacity of tumor cells for nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a major
determinant of the efficacy of and resistance to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics,
such as cisplatin. Here, we demonstrate that using lesion-specific monoclonal
antibodies, NER capacity is enhanced in human lung cancer cells after preconditioning
with DNA-damaging agents. Preconditioning of cells with a nonlethal dose of UV
radiation facilitated the kinetics of subsequent cisplatin repair and vice versa. Dualincision assay confirmed that the enhanced NER capacity was sustained for 2 days.
Checkpoint activation by ATR kinase and expression of NER factors were not altered
significantly by the preconditioning, whereas association of XPA, the rate-limiting
factor in NER, with chromatin was accelerated. In preconditioned cells, SIRT1
expression was increased, and this resulted in a decrease in acetylated XPA. Inhibition
of SIRT1 abrogated the preconditioning-induced predominant XPA binding to DNA
lesions. Taking these data together, we conclude that upregulated NER capacity in
preconditioned lung cancer cells is caused partly by an increased level of SIRT1, which
modulates XPA sensitivity to DNA damage. This study provides some insights into
the molecular mechanism of chemoresistance through acquisition of enhanced DNA
repair capacity in cancer cells.

however, the change in NER kinetics upon sequential
cisplatin treatment or upon cisplatin treatment followed
by treatment with another type of NER-dependent DNAdamaging agent, such as UV radiation, has not been
precisely investigated due to the limitation of analytical
tools such as cisplatin-DNA adduct-specific monoclonal
antibody.
NER is a complex process carried out by seven
xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) proteins (XPA to XPG)
and approximately two dozen non-XP proteins [8].
Importantly, upregulation of only a few rate-limiting
components of the NER system is necessary to increase a
cell’s capacity for NER. One such important rate-limiting
factor is XPA, which has been found to be overexpressed
in cisplatin-resistant cancers [9, 10]. In ovarian cancer,
XPA was shown to be expressed at a higher level in
tumors of patients resistant to cisplatin treatment [11].
Low levels of XPA are expressed in testicular cancer,
which is generally very responsive to cisplatin, providing
further correlative evidence for the importance of NER

INTRODUCTION
Effective treatment of cancers usually requires the
use of genotoxic chemotherapy. In most cases, multiple
drugs are used, as resistance to single agents occurs almost
universally. However, this causes many side effects for
patients and thus, elucidation of mechanisms that confer
chemoresistance has been a major goal of cancer biologists
for decades. Cisplatin is one of the most commonly
prescribed chemotherapeutic agents and produces
platinum-DNA adducts, including intra- and inter-strand
adducts and DNA-protein crosslinks [1, 2]. In humans,
these lesions are removed primarily by nucleotide excision
repair (NER) and hence, the status of NER is a critical
indicator of the success of chemotherapy with cisplatin
[3–5]. The importance of NER is highlighted by the finding
that defects in this pathway result in hypersensitivity to
cisplatin, and that restoration of NER activity reduces
sensitivity to more normal levels [6, 7]. In spite of the
critical role of NER in cisplatin resistance in cancer cells,

in cisplatin resistance [12, 13]. The rate-limiting effect
of XPA in NER has been demonstrated in normal human
fibroblasts (NHFs) as well. When XPA was downregulated
to 60%, 10%, and 4% of its original value in the NHF-1
cell line in a controlled manner by titrating the amount of
XPA siRNA, the rates of NER of both the 6-4 photoproduct
(6-4PP) and the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD), the
two major types of DNA lesion caused by UV irradiation,
were proportionally reduced [14]. Although the rate of
repair of CPDs was linearly correlated with the level
of XPA, the rate of 6-4PP repair exhibited a parabolic
relationship with the XPA level, which is consistent with
the well-established fact that the 6-4PP is repaired at a
5–10-fold faster rate than the CPD [15].
The steady-state level of XPA is mainly controlled
by the circadian clock [16, 17], HERC2 [18, 19] and
SIRT1 [20, 21]. The transcriptional activity of the
circadian clock induces a daily rhythm of XPA gene
expression, whereas HERC2 functions as an E3 ubiquitin
ligase for XPA degradation in a proteasome-dependent
fashion. The half-life of XPA protein is approximately
4 h in the absence of DNA damage, but much longer in
the presence of DNA damage [19]. In response to DNA
damage, XPA is phosphorylated by ATR kinase, which
stabilizes XPA by preventing its association with HERC2
[18]. Thus, ATR activity in response to DNA damage
can be utilized to a certain extent as a surrogate marker
for NER activity. SIRT1, a NAD+-dependent histone
deacetylase, also plays a critical role in the NER pathway.
A recent study revealed that SIRT1 can deacetylate XPA
and that this is required for interaction with replication
protein A (RPA) and optimal NER activity [20].
Because of the significance of the NER capacity
in a mechanism of chemoresistance in cancer cells, we
decided to investigate the change in NER capacity after
preconditioning of cells with a nonlethal dose of a DNAdamaging agent, which generates cells that mimic resistant
cells after chemotherapy. For NER kinetic analysis
we employed lesion-specific monoclonal antibodies
to detect UV-induced CPD or 6-4PP and cisplatininduced platinum-GpG adduct [22]. We found that the
preconditioning renders cancer cells more resistant to
a subsequent lethal dose of DNA-damaging agent by
modulating the sensitivity of XPA association with DNA
lesions hence, enhancing NER activity and conferring
chemoresistance on cancer cells.

of cell cycle on DNA repair activity, human non-small
cell lung carcinoma A549 and large cell lung carcinoma
H460 cells were grown to confluence and kept for
additional four days to completely block cell proliferation
(Figure  1A–1C) before treatment with DNA damaging
agents. Several UV doses were applied to measure the
repair activity and cell viability. The amount of CPD
lesions on genomic DNA was analyzed by immunoslot
blotting (Figure 1D), and cell viability after 24 h of UV
exposure was assessed by a fluorescence-based cell
viability assay (Figure 1E). Upon irradiation with 5 J/m2
UV, there was no significant decrease of cell number and
24 h was sufficient for complete repair of CPDs. However,
irradiation of cells with more than 5 J/m2, including 10 or
20 J/m2, resulted in substantial decrease in cell number,
and CPDs still remained on genomic DNA at 24 h after
UV irradiation. Based on these results, we chose 5 J/m2
of UV dose as a repairable and nonlethal condition for
activation of DNA damage response in lung cancer cells,
which behaved like recurrent cancer or chemoresistant
cells after primary chemotherapy with DNA-damaging
agents. We termed this condition as “preconditioning”
(PreC) and examined whether it affected subsequent
DNA repair activity evoked by cisplatin treatment at a
lethal concentration of 10 μM. As shown in Figure 1F
and 1G, UV-PreC facilitated repair of subsequent PtGpG adduct compared to the nonpreconditioned control
(nonPreC). In the inverse experiment, we preconditioned
cells with a nonlethal concentration of cisplatin (5 μM)
and then investigated repair of the UV-induced CPDs. As
expected, repair of CPDs caused by 10 J/m2 UV required
more time than those induced by 5 J/m2 UV (Figure 2A,
lanes 1 and 2). This pattern was also observed when
cells were preconditioned with cisplatin (Figure 2A,
lanes 4 and 5). However, the kinetics of CPD repair after
the same dose of UV were much faster when cells had
been preconditioned with cisplatin (Figure 2B and 2C),
which is similar to the effect of UV-PreC shown in Figure
1. Next, we measured Pt-GpG removal rate following
Pt-PreC. As shown in Figure 3A, there was no remaining
Pt-GpG adduct after 48  h of Pt-PreC with 5 μM of
cisplatin. Meanwhile the repair kinetics upon following
cisplatin treatment was much faster in Pt-PreC than
nonPreC cells (Figure 3B). These results suggest that
NER activity may be upregulated by PreC with a nonlethal
dose of DNA-damaging agent. To test this hypothesis we
measured the cell’s NER capacity at specific times from
12 h to 96 h after PreC. To this end, we used an in vitro
dual-incision assay, for which we prepared DNA substrate
containing UV-induced 6-4PP, which is a better substrate
than CPD, and cell lysate prepared at various time points
after PreC. Figure 4 shows that the lysate of nonPreC cells
had no time-dependent effect on dual-incision activity,
whereas the lysate of Pt-PreC cells showed changes in
NER capacity depending on the duration of time after
PreC. NER activity started to increase 12 h after PreC and

RESULTS
In order to obtain insight into the effect of DNA
repair capacity on the mechanism of chemoresistance, we
investigated changes in NER activity after treatment of
cells with nonlethal doses of DNA-damaging agents. We
used two monoclonal antibodies to specifically detect UVinduced CPDs and Pt-GpG adducts, lesions that are the
exclusive substrates of NER [3, 4]. To exclude the effect

peaked at 48 h, at which time the lesions were completely
repaired. However the enhancement of NER capacity by
PreC was no longer detected 72 h after PreC (Figure 4).
To decipher the mechanism underlying enhancement
of NER capacity by PreC, we first analyzed the levels of
core NER factors XPA through XPG at 24 h after PreC and
compared this with levels in nonpreconditioned controls
because some previous reports demonstrated increase of
core NER factors including XPA and XPF during adaptive
response. As shown in Figure 5, however, there was no
significant change in the expression of NER factors
regardless of PreC. Next, we analyzed ATR kinase activity
indirectly by monitoring the level of phosphorylation of
its substrate proteins p53 and CHK1. ATR is known to
augment NER activity by phosphorylating and, thus
stabilizing, XPA in response to DNA damage [18]. The

result indicates that UV-PreC had no effect on ATR
activity as no significant alteration in phosphorylation
of p53 or CHK1 was detected after PreC (Figure 5). In
addition, similar phosphorylation profiles were obtained
from nonPreC and UV-PreC cells, which implies that ATR
activity had not been altered by PreC.
XPA is the key rate-limiting factor for NER [11,
14]. However, given that PreC had no effect on XPA
protein level or ATR activity, we next examined the effect
of PreC on XPA mobility to damaged DNA using local
UV irradiation. XPA foci at locally-exposed sites strongly
coincided with 6-4PP lesions (Figure 6A). As similar
as shown in immunoslot blot data in previous figures,
Pt-PreC accelerated the 6-4PP removal than nonPreC
control, as demonstrated by more rapid disappearance of
6-4PP signal (Figure 6A). For a quantitative analysis we

counted the number of XPA foci-positive cells and found
no difference between nonPreC and Pt-PreC within 30
min of recovery time (Figure 6B). However, at 60 min
after UV exposure approximately 3 times less XPA focipositive cells were detected in Pt-PreC, indicating that
the Pt-PreC may modulate the efficient XPA recruitment

on DNA lesions followed by a robust repair and possibly
conferring resistance to toxic DNA damage. Because
SIRT1, a histone deacetylase, has been implicated
recently in the NER pathway by virtue of deacetylating
XPA and thus enhancing NER activity, we measured
the level of SIRT1. Interestingly, UV-PreC cells showed

increased levels of SIRT1 compared to nonPreC control
(Figure 7A). To verify the acetylation status of XPA we
immunoprecipitated XPA and determined the acetylation
level with anti-acetyl-lysine antibody. The result indeed
indicated a decrease in acetylation level of XPA with
UV-PreC, which is immediately reversed by treatment of
SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 (Figure 7B). To confirm the role
of SIRT1 in the PreC effect, we pretreated cells with the
specific SIRT1 inhibitor EX-527 [23] before treatment of
cisplatin following the UV-PreC and investigated XPA
loading to chromatin. UV-PreC-induced enhancement of
XPA chromatin loading was reduced in the presence of
EX527, implying that the SIRT1 regulated XPA acetyl

status may contribute XPA sensitivity to DNA lesions.
The PreC-induced repair capacity was also compromised
by SIRT1 inhibition (Figure 7C), which implies that
upregulation of SIRT1 is the major mechanism in PreCinduced NER potentiation.

DISCUSSION
An ultimate goal in cancer therapy is to devise
individually tailored treatment plans that target growthpromoting pathways and circumvent drug resistance. In
general, tumor cells acquire resistance by manipulating
biochemical mechanisms that reduce pharmacokinetics

or by acquiring additional alterations in DNA damage
response pathways. Hence, an understanding of these
processes is important for predicting treatment response
and for the development of novel treatment strategies
for chemoresistance. Most chemotherapeutics rely for
their anticancer activity on induction of a DNA damage
response to promote the apoptotic pathway [24, 25].
However, DNA repair pathways counteract this effect by
repairing damaged DNA and restoring it to normal status.
Cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin are platinum-based
drugs for treatment of many types of cancers, including
head and neck, testicular, ovarian, cervical, lung, colorectal,
and relapsed lymphoma [3–5, 7]. The cytotoxicity of
platinating agents is thought to be due to the platinum
intrastrand crosslink that forms on DNA, such as Pt-GpG
adduct [3, 4]. Resistance can be caused by a number of
cellular adaptations, including reduced uptake, inactivation
by intracellular antioxidants, and increased DNA repair
capacity [3, 7]. In this report, we identified a plausible
mechanism of chemoresistance by which NER capacity
is enhanced by preconditioning of cells with a nonlethal
dose of DNA-damaging agents (PreC). By virtue of lesionspecific antibodies we were able to precisely measure the
repair kinetics caused by specific DNA damage. Pt-GpG
adduct removal following UV-PreC, UV-CDP or UV-6-4PP
removal following Pt-PreC and Pt-GpG removal following
Pt-PreC were enhanced compared to nonPreC control,
which led us the general conclusion that PreC makes cells
more resistant to subsequent toxic DNA damage at least

in lung carcinoma A549 and H460 cells. Some earlier
studies had already shown the adaptive response evoked by
preconditioning of which are mostly driven by increase of
core NER factor expression. For instance, preconditioning
cells with a low dose of ionizing radiation (IR) enhances
UV-induced NER [26]. In response to IR, transcription
of NER genes, such as XPC and DDB2 (XPE), was
upregulated due to the stabilization of p53, which induces
transcription of the genes. However, in this study we did not
detect such an increase in any core NER factors; nor did we
detect p53 activation. Instead we found a novel pathway for
an adaptive response mediated by upregulation of SIRT1.
Because the expression level of XPA, the rate limiting
factor in NER was not changed by PreC we assumed that
posttranslational modification of XPA occurred during
PreC, but that was not mediated by ATR because ATR
activity was not altered by PreC. Importantly, we found
that increased expression of SIRT1 upon PreC compared
to nonPreC control. Reportedly SIRT1 contributed to the
decrease of acetylated XPA or increase of deacetylated
XPA [20] that showed preferential binding to the DNA
damage, required for the enhanced NER capacity induced
by PreC. Antagonizing SIRT1 activity using inhibitors such
as EX527, sirtinol, and the tenovins has been demonstrated
to induce p53-mediated apoptosis [27–29], suggesting that
SIRT1 inhibition may be beneficial for treating certain
types of cancer. Here we support the SIRT1’s role in
chemoresistance in some types of lung cancer cells and
demonstrate that using SIRT1 inhibitor to treat a certain

measure a constitutive protease activity within live cells
using a fluorogenic and cell permeable peptide substrate.

Whole-cell lysate prepared as described [31] was
used to determine the levels of proteins. Antibodies used
in this study include those against XPA (Kamiya), XPBXPD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA),
XPE, p-p53, p-CHK1, GAPDH, SIRT1, acetyl-lysine
(Cell Signaling Technology), XPF, and XPG (both Abcam,
Cambridge, UK). For immunoprecipitation of XPA,
1 mg of whole-cell lysate was incubated with 1 μg of antiXPA conjugated to Protein A/G-agarose beads (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO, USA) for 12 h at 4°C with rotation. After
washing with lysis buffer, proteins were eluted from the
beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer and resolved on
10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. For detection of XPA
acetylation, anti-acetyl-lysine was employed.

Immunoslot blotting
Genomic DNA was obtained using a QIAamp
DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and 100 μg
(for CPD) or 500 μg (for 6-4PP and platinum [Pt]-GpG
adduct) DNA was vacuum-transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane using a BioDot SF Microfiltration apparatus
(BioRad). DNA was crosslinked to the membrane by
incubation at 80°C for 2 h under vacuum. Monoclonal
antibodies that recognize CPD (Kamiya, Seattle, WA,
USA), 6-4PP (Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan) and Pt-GpG
(Oncolyze, Essen, Germany) were used to detect the
amounts of remaining lesions in the genomic DNA. After
the immunoslot blot assay, the total DNA amounts loaded
onto the membrane were visualized with SYBR-gold
staining, and these values were used for normalization.

Local UV irradiation and immunofluorescence
Cells preconditioned with cisplatin were
irradiated with UV-C at a dose of 200 J/m2 through an
isopore polycarbonate filter with pores 5 μm in diameter
(EMD Millipore). After platinum preconditioning (PtPreC), if necessary, cells were treated with 1 μM of
specific SIRT1 inhibitor EX-527 (Sigma) for 5 h before
local UV irradiation. After incubation for the recovery
times the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for
15 min, followed by conventional immunofluorescence
staining procedures. UV-induced lesions were counterlabeled with anti-6-4PP antibody, and XPA foci-positive
cells were counted for quantitative analysis. The
images were captured using Nikon imaging software
NIS-Elements 4.0.

Dual-incision NER activity assay
Assay of NER activity in the cell lysate toward
6-4PP-containing DNA substrate was carried out as
reported previously [30]. Briefly, 10 fmol of 140-bp
duplex with a 6-4PP in the center and 32P-label at the
5th phosphodiester bond 5’ to the site of the lesion was
incubated with 70 μg of lysate in 25 μL of excision
buffer at 30°C for 1 h. The amount of excision product
was used as a measure of NER capacity in the lysate.
The 6-4PP-containing linear duplex substrate DNA and
NER-competent cell lysate were prepared as described
previously [16].
