Abstract
Current therapy of gynecologic malignancies consists of platinum-containing chemotherapy. Resistance to
therapy is associated with increased levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), 2 inﬂammatory
mediators known to skew differentiation of monocytes to tumor-promoting M2 macrophages. We investigated
the impact of cisplatin and carboplatin on 10 different cervical and ovarian cancer cell lines as well as on the ability
of the tumor cells to affect the differentiation and function of cocultured monocytes in vitro. Treatment with
cisplatin or carboplatin increased the potency of tumor cell lines to induce IL-10–producing M2 macrophages,
which displayed increased levels of activated STAT3 due to tumor-produced IL-6 as well as decreased levels of
activated STAT1 and STAT6 related to the PGE2 production of tumor cells. Blockade of canonical NF-kB signaling
showed that the effect of the chemotherapy was abrogated, preventing the subsequent increased production of
PGE2 and/or IL-6 by the tumor cell lines. Treatment with the COX-inhibitor indomethacin and/or the clinical
monoclonal antibody against interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), tocilizumab, prevented M2-differentiation. Importantly, no correlation existed between the production of PGE2 or IL-6 by cancer cells and their resistance to
chemotherapy-induced cell death, indicating that other mechanisms underlie the reported chemoresistance of
tumors producing these factors. Our data suggest that a chemotherapy-mediated increase in tumor-promoting
M2 macrophages may form an indirect mechanism for chemoresistance. Hence, concomitant therapy with COX
inhibitors and/or IL-6R antibodies might increase the clinical effect of platinum-based chemotherapy in
otherwise resistant tumors. Cancer Res; 73(8); 2480–92. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Current treatment of advanced cervical and epithelial ovarian cancer includes platinum-based multimodality therapy (1,
2). Many patients with gynecologic cancer develop resistance
to platinum drugs, thereby limiting further treatment options
and decreasing overall survival rates (1, 3). Gynecologic cancers
are generally known as immunogenic, and prominent correlations exist between the inﬁltration of tumors by immune cells
and clinical outcome (4, 5). Macrophages are the most abundant immune cells present in the tumor microenvironment.
Macrophages originate from monocytic precursors in the
blood and undergo speciﬁc differentiation depending on cues
in the local tissue. Two extreme polarization states of macro-

phages are known, M1 and M2, of which the latter has poor
antigen-presenting capacity, prevents T-cell activation, contributes to suppressing dendritic cell (DC) functions, as well as
enhances angiogenesis and metastasis (6). The presence of M2
macrophages in tumors is correlated to poor prognosis in
several human cancers (7, 8). Previously, we and others showed
the inﬂuence of cervical (9) and ovarian cancer cells (10, 11) on
differentiation of monocytes into DC or macrophages. The
majority of cancer cells either hampered monocyte to DC
differentiation or skewed their differentiation toward M2-like
macrophages, depending on their ability to produce prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and/or interleukin (IL)-6. Blocking these
cytokines completely restored their differentiation toward DC
(9–11). Interestingly, in gynecologic malignancies, upregulation of the COX enzymes has been associated with platinum
drug resistance (12, 13). In addition, high levels of IL-6 in sera
and ascites of patients with these gynecologic malignancies
have also been related to chemoresistance and poor clinical
outcome (14, 15). IL-6 is one of the major immunoregulatory
cytokines present in the tumor microenvironment and induces
several pathways leading to tumor proliferation, angiogenesis,
and chemoresistance (16, 17). One important pathway stimulated by IL-6 is activation of STAT3 by phosphorylation.
High levels of phosphorylated STAT3 are found in tumors
(18) and tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells (APC; ref. 19).

Effect of Chemotherapy on Tumor Microenvironment

Consequently, STAT3 signaling in APC is linked to the induction of T-cell tolerance (20).
In view of the observations that PGE2 and IL-6 are associated
with chemoresistance and with the tumor-induced differentiation of tumor-promoting M2 macrophages as well as recent
literature indicating that chemotherapy may bear impact on
the function and thereby the efﬁcacy of tumor-inﬁltrating
immune cells (21), we investigated the potential effects of
platinum-based chemotherapeutics on the differentiation and
function of APC under the inﬂuence of cervical and epithelial
ovarian cancer cells in vitro.
We found that the treatment of tumor cells with cisplatin or
carboplatin increased the potency of some tumor cell lines to
skew monocytes to M2-like macrophages. These M2-like
macrophages displayed IL-6–mediated increased levels of activated STAT3 and PGE2-mediated decreased levels of activated
STAT1 and STAT6, which are associated with immune potentiating pathways. The underlying mechanism was a cisplatin or
carboplatin-induced enhanced activation of the NF-kB pathway likely through the chemotherapy-induced DNA damage
response (DDR). This resulted in an increased production of
PGE2 and IL-6 by cancer cells, but only if they already produced
these factors, and an enhanced skewing of monocytes toward
M2-like macrophages. Increased numbers of tumor-promoting
M2-like macrophages may form an indirect mechanism for
chemoresistance suggesting that concomitant therapy with
COX inhibitors and/or blocking of IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) might
increase the antitumor effect of chemotherapy.

Materials and Methods
Media and reagents
APC and cancer cell lines were cultured as described earlier
(9) in RPMI-1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum (FCS; Greiner Bio-one), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine
(Cambrex), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and
50 mmol/L b-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen), also referred to as
complete or control medium. Adherent cells were harvested
using trypsin/EDTA (Invitrogen). The following factors were
used to culture APC: 500 U/mL IL-4 (Invitrogen), 800 U/mL
granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF;
Immunotools), 25 ng/mL macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF; R&D), 1 to 10 ng/mL PGE2 (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1
to 50 ng/mL IL-6 (Immunotools). The toll-like receptor (TLR)
ligand 0.25 mg/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Sigma-Aldrich)
was used to activate APC; to mimic T-cell interaction, APCs
were stimulated with irradiated CD40 ligand (CD40L)-expressing mouse ﬁbroblasts. The following cytokines were used to
induce STAT phosphorylation: 500 U/mL IFN-g (Bender Medsystems), 10 ng/mL IL-10 (Peprotech), or 500 U/mL IL-4.
Chemotherapeutics, COX inhibitor, and monoclonal
antibody against IL-6(R) and Bay 11-7082
Cells were treated with 0.2 to 50 mg/mL cisplatin or 2 to 500
mg/mL carboplatin (Pharmachemie) and/or 25 mmol/L indomethacin (Cayman Chemical) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) or as a control only with the corresponding concentration of DMSO. The monoclonal antibody (mAb) used to

www.aacrjournals.org

block the (s)IL-6R was tocilizumab, 5 to 50 mg/mL (RoActemra,
Roche BV). We used 0.02 to 200 mg/mL of the selective inhibitor
of kB-a (Ik-Ba) inhibitor Bay 11-7082 (Sigma-Aldrich).
Tumor cell line culture
The human cervical cancer cell lines HELA, CASKI, CSCC1,
CSCC7, and CC8 were typed and cultured as described earlier
(9). Ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3 and A2780 were purchased
from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures. CAOV3
was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC), and OVCAR3 and COV413B were kindly provided by
the department of Clinical Pathology of the Leiden University
Medical Center (Leiden, the Netherlands). All human ovarian
cancer cell lines were of epithelial origin. Cell lines were
authenticated every half year by short tandem repeat (STR)
DNA markers as described previously (22). In brief, PCR
ampliﬁcation of 8 highly polymorphic microsatellite STR loci
and gender determination were measured, and the uniqueness
of DNA proﬁles was compared for identity control within the
STR database of ATCC (23). Stock vials were thawed and
cultured for 10 passages and routinely tested for the presence
of mycoplasma.
Cell lines were grown in culture ﬂasks at 80% to 90%
conﬂuence and harvested with trypsin/EDTA and cultured in
6- or 12-well plates (Corning) for 24 hours, treated with
chemotherapeutics and/or COX inhibitors and/or tocilizumab
as indicated. After 24 hours of treatment, cells were washed
carefully and medium was refreshed. Tumor supernatants
(TSN) were harvested after an additional 24 hours of culture
and stored at 20 C. Cancer cell lines were cultured in the
presence of 2 mg/mL cisplatin or 20 mg/mL carboplatin for 24
hours. These doses are estimated levels of chemotherapy in the
tumor tissue because in patients, the maximum doses for
cisplatin or carboplatin as measured in the blood are 5 to 6
mg/mL and 40 to 80 mg/mL, respectively. Assuming that the
levels in (poorly vascularized) tumor tissue are somewhat
lower, the doses used in vitro are representative for the in vivo
situation (24–29).
APC culture
APC were differentiated as described earlier (9). A brief
explanation is given in Supplementary Material and Methods.
To address the direct cytotoxic effect of chemotherapy on APC,
the cultures were supplemented with 20% TSN or control
medium (monocyte-derived DC; mo-DC) and titrated doses
of chemotherapeutics, as indicated. To investigate the capacity
of chemotherapy to alter the differentiation of APC by acting
through tumor cell-mediated mechanisms, the cultures were
supplemented with 20% TSN of untreated and treated cancer
cell lines or control medium (mo-DC).
Transwell assay
Monocytes were cultured in a 24-well plate in complete
medium with or without 2 mg/mL cisplatin or 20 mg/mL
carboplatin. Cancer cells were cultured in the top compartment of a Transwell 0.4 mm pore insert (Corning). After 3 days,
complete medium with cytokines was added. At day 6, cells
were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry.

Cell survival
To determine the survival of the cancer cells upon chemotherapeutic treatment, an MTT assay (Trevigen) was conducted, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell
survival was calculated as follows: (OD570–655 nm for treated/
OD570–655 nm for untreated)  100%. To determine APC survival
upon chemotherapeutic treatment, cells were analyzed by ﬂow
cytometry. Cell survival was calculated as follows: (% of cells in
live gate for treated/% of cells in live gate for untreated) 
100%.
Phosphorylated STAT analysis
Phosphorylated STAT (pSTAT) analysis was conducted
according to Krutzik and colleagues (30). Cells were ﬁxed in
1.5% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 minutes at
room temperature, harvested, and washed twice in PBS containing 2% FCS (PAA) and 0.02% sodium azide (AZL Pharmacy). Then, cells were permeabilized in 90% methanol (SigmaAldrich) for 10 minutes on ice, washed, and stained for pSTAT1
(pY701), pSTAT3 (pY705), or pSTAT6 (pY641; all PE; all BD
Biosciences). Expression was calculated as follows: geometric
mean of ﬂuorescence intensity of condition of interest 
geometric mean of ﬂuorescence intensity of the corresponding
unstained control. Relative expression (ratio) was calculated as
follows: expression of condition of interest/expression of control condition (mo-DC).
Cytokine analysis
IL-12p70 and IL-10 were analyzed using ELISA Kits from BD
Biosciences or by inﬂammatory cytometric bead array (CBA)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. To evaluate the
cytokines present in supernatant of cancer cells, VEGF, IL-1b,
IL-6, and IL-8 were determined by ELISA or CBA and M-CSF by
Bioplex (Bio-Rad). PGE2 levels were measured using the competitive PGE2 Immunoassay Kit (Enzo Life Sciences).
PRDX1 knockdown using shRNA
Lentivirus expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against
peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) or TurboGFP (sh control) were
produced and used to infect the CC8 cells at multiplicity of
infection 5. Further details can be read in the Supplementary
Material and Methods.

Results
DC differentiation is altered by cervical and ovarian
carcinoma cell lines
Previously, we showed that when the TSN of cervical cancer
cells was added to monocyte cultures, this could skew the
differentiation of monocytes to cells resembling M2 macrophages (M2-like macrophages; ref. 9). We investigated whether
also ovarian cancer cells could have this effect. Therefore, not
only 5 cervical cancer cell lines but also 5 ovarian cancer cell
lines were tested. First, the phenotype of in vitro differentiated
monocytes cultured with TSN of cervical cancer and ovarian
cancer cell lines was assessed by the use of a panel of APC
markers at day 6 of differentiation. We found that TSN from the
2 ovarian cancer cell lines, COV413B and CAOV3, skewed

2482

Cancer Res; 73(8) April 15, 2013

differentiation of monocytes toward a M2-like macrophage
phenotype, and we conﬁrmed the M2-like macrophage skewing capacity of HELA, CC8, and CSCC7. We will refer to these as
M2-like macrophages and the TSN inducing these cells as M2TSN (HELA, CC8, CSCC7, COV413B, and CAOV3). Monocytes
cultured in the presence of cancer cell lines that hampered
monocyte differentiation, but did not induce M2-like macrophages, are referred to as tumor APC and the supernatant
inducing this phenotype as APC-TSN (CSCC1, CASKI, SKOV3,
OVCAR3, and A2780; Supplementary Table S1).
Then, the functionality of these cultured APC was tested by a
subsequent stimulation with LPS (a TLR4 agonist), most often
used to stimulate tumor resident DC in vitro or with CD40Lexpressing ﬁbroblasts (CD40L) to mimic APC-T–cell interaction. The production of IL-12 and IL-10 was measured after 48
hours. In accordance with our previous results, monocytes
skewed by the TSN of ovarian cell lines COV413B and CAOV3
toward an M2-like phenotype produced almost no IL-12, but
instead high levels of IL-10 when compared with mo-DC. APCTSN displayed a similar balance in IL-12/IL-10 production as
mo-DC.
To understand which soluble products in the TSN of ovarian
cancer cells drove the differentiation of M2 macrophages, we
measured the production of TGFb, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, VEGF,
PGE2, and M-CSF (Supplementary Table S2) and found that
COV413B produced large amounts of IL-6 (25 ng/mL) but no
PGE2, whereas CAOV3 produced both IL-6 (14 ng/mL) and
PGE2 (2 ng/mL). Blocking of both these cytokines revealed that
they are responsible for induction of phenotypically and functionally M2-like macrophages not only by cervical cancer cell
lines (9) but also by ovarian cancer cell lines (data not shown).
Cisplatin and carboplatin alter APC differentiation and
function by affecting cancer cells
First, to address the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin and carboplatin on our panel of cancer cell lines, we applied an MTT
assay (Supplementary Fig. S1). We observed that the PGE2
and/or IL-6–producing cell lines, HELA and CC8, were most
sensitive for chemotherapy, whereas COV413B, CAOV3, and
CSCC7 producing PGE2 and/or IL-6, were most resistant to
chemotherapy. In addition, SKOV3 was chemoresistant,
whereas the cells did not produce PGE2 and/or IL-6 (Supplementary Fig. S1). This showed that there was no direct relation
between the production of IL-6 and/or PGE2 and chemoresistance of cancer cells.
Furthermore, the direct cytotoxic effect of cisplatin and
carboplatin on the different types of APC (mo-DC, APC-TSN,
and M2-TSN) was addressed. Monocytes were cultured in the
presence of TSN and increasing doses of chemotherapy. Following treatment, cells were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry.
Interestingly, M2-like macrophages were more vulnerable to
chemotherapy than tumor APC or mo-DC (Fig. 1A). Subsequently, the sensitivity of classical M1 macrophages (monocytes cultured in the presence of GM-CSF) and classical M2
macrophages (monocytes cultured in the presence of M-CSF)
to cisplatin and carboplatin was tested (31). The classical M2
macrophages were also more sensitive to chemotherapy than
M1 macrophages and DC (Fig. 1B).

We previously showed that IL-6 and PGE2 promoted the
differentiation of M2 macrophages (9), cells, which are associated with a worse response to therapy (7, 8). Therefore, we
studied the effect of chemotherapy treatment on tumor cells
focusing on the tumor-induced differentiation of APC. Tumor
cells were incubated with a dose of chemotherapy representative for the level within the tumor microenvironment. Subsequently, monocytes were cultured in the presence of TSN
isolated from untreated, cisplatin, or carboplatin-treated cancer cells. A clear increase in the percentage of CD1aCD14þCD206þCD163þ M2 macrophages was observed when
M2-TSN from treated cancer cells was used compared with
M2-TSN from untreated cells. This effect was not observed for
tumor cells producing APC-TSN (Fig. 2), excluding the possibility that cell debris would have been the cause for the effects
observed with the M2-TSN of chemotherapy-treated tumor

cells. To mimic the natural situation, we used a Transwell
system to culture monocytes and cancer cells together in the
presence of cisplatin or carboplatin. This set-up conﬁrmed that
platinum-containing chemotherapeutics did not inﬂuence the
differentiation of the APC directly as the phenotype of mo-DC
remained the same upon treatment. However, addition of
platinum chemotherapy to the culture system resulted in an
increased percentage of M2-like macrophages (Fig. 2A).
As expected (9), stimulation of differentiated monocytes
with LPS or CD40L resulted in a strong cell-surface expression
of the markers CD80, CD83, CD86, HLA-DR, and PD-L1 (data
not shown). Furthermore, chemotherapeutic treatment
resulted in a signiﬁcant (P < 0.01) functional enhancement of
M2-like macrophage function (measured by indirect as well as
Transwell assay). These M2-like macrophages produced signiﬁcantly less IL-12 and more IL-10 upon activation with LPS

levels were increased upon platinum-based treatment in accordance with the cytokine proﬁle of the cell lines (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Notably, cisplatin or carboplatin treatment of the
cancer cells did not induce or enhance the production of TGFb,
IL-1b, IL-8, VEGF, and M-CSF (Supplementary Table S2).
Altered levels of phosphorylated STAT1, 3, and 6 in TSNdifferentiated macrophages
To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the effect of
chemotherapy on APC differentiation and function, we
studied the involvement of STAT. Therefore, the intracellular pSTAT levels of APC were determined (Fig. 4A). Compared with mo-DC, APC cultured in the presence of all IL-6–
producing cancer cell lines (CASKI, CC8, HELA, COV413B,
and CAOV3), had signiﬁcantly increased levels of pSTAT3
(Fig. 4B and data not shown). A number of APC cultures
displayed a decrease in the levels of pSTAT1 and pSTAT6.
This was associated with the presence of PGE2 in the TSN
(Fig. 4B and data not shown). Monocytes cultured in the
presence of cancer cell lines that did not produce PGE2 or IL6 (CCSC1, SKOV3, OVCAR3, and A2780) did not show
alteration in pSTAT levels. To test whether these factors
were responsible for the altered levels of phophorylated
STATs, we differentiated monocytes in the presence of
increasing doses of PGE2 and IL-6. Indeed, the levels of

www.aacrjournals.org

pSTAT1 and pSTAT6 were dose dependently decreased in
response to PGE2, whereas the levels of pSTAT3 increased
upon increasing amounts of IL-6 (Fig. 4C). We hypothesized
that the observed increase in M2-skewing capacity of tumor
cells treated with cisplatin or carboplatin would correlate
with further alteration of pSTAT levels. Indeed, the use of
M2-TSN isolated from cancer cell lines treated with cisplatin
and carboplatin resulted in M2-like macrophages displaying
signiﬁcantly higher pSTAT3 and decreased pSTAT1 and

M2-TSN from untreated cancer cells in almost all cases (Fig.

CAOV3 already displayed low levels of pSTAT1 and pSTAT6
compared with mo-DC, and when the TSN of CAOV3 treated
with carboplatin was used, no signiﬁcant further decrease in
pSTAT1/6 levels was found, despite the increase in PGE2
production.

monocloncal antibody against (s)IL-6R that is clinically successful in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and Castleman

Previously, Wang and colleagues showed that cisplatin can

Figure 6. Enhanced PGE2 and IL-6 production in cancer cells in response to NF-kB activation. Increasing doses of the selective inhibitor of IkB
phosphorylation and also of the canonical NF-kB pathway, Bay 11-7082, were added 1 hour before platinum treatment. Mean (with SEM) of 3 experiments.

Therefore, the expression of PRDX1 was blocked by shRNA, to
prevent this protein to form a complex and hence, to prevent
the increased production of PGE2. We successfully downregulated the expression of PRDX1, but this did not result in
decreased COX-2 mRNA levels upon chemotherapy treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S3).
The second mechanism that could play a role in the
increased production of PGE2 and IL-6 by cancer cells is the
activation of DDR pathway as this can lead to NF-kB activation
and subsequently to the production of PGE2 and IL-6 (35, 36).
To block the NF-kB pathway, Bay 11-7082, a selective inhibitor
of I-kB phosphorylation and as such also of the canonical NFkB pathway, was used. Both untreated and cisplatin-treated
cancer cells were incubated with increased doses of Bay 117082. Indeed, the cisplatin-induced increase in PGE2 and IL-6
production was blocked by Bay 11-7082 in a dose-dependent
fashion (Fig. 6).

Discussion
Here, we showed 2 potential effects of platinum-based
chemotherapy of gynecologic cancers on the immune system. First, we showed that M-CSF–induced M2 macrophages
and M2-like macrophages are most vulnerable for chemotherapy. Monocyte-derived DC and M1 macrophages were
only affected at higher doses, suggesting a selective survival
beneﬁt of these cells. This can be considered beneﬁcial for

2488

Cancer Res; 73(8) April 15, 2013

the patient. However, while it is clear that a sufﬁcient dose
of cisplatin or carboplatin to kill M2-like macrophages will
be reached within the blood stream, one may question
whether this also occurs within the tumor microenvironment. The second effect concerns tumors in which the
NF-kB pathway, leading to the production of PGE2 and/or
IL-6, is already activated. Treatment of these tumors with
cisplatin and carboplatin resulted in an increased production of these 2 inﬂammatory mediators and subsequently
in a more pronounced skewing of monocyte differentiation toward the tumor promoting M2-like macrophages,
reﬂected by their production of large amounts of IL-10,
decreased production of IL-12, activation of tolerogenic
STAT3 pathway, and a decrease in the immune potentiating
STAT1 and STAT6 pathways. This effect should be considered detrimental to patients as it implies that, upon treatment with platinum-based regimens of PGE2 and/or IL-6–
producing tumors, the number of local tumor-promoting
M2 macrophages may increase, helping the tumor to defy
the chemotherapeutic treatment. This would ﬁt well with
the existing literature showing that chemoresistance of
cervical and ovarian cancer is associated with increased
levels of PGE2 and IL-6 (12–15).
We studied 2 possible mechanisms responsible for this
effect and showed that activation of the NF-kB pathway was
required, which occurred most likely via the DDR pathway.
Indeed platinum-containing chemotherapeutics act by

Effect of Chemotherapy on Tumor Microenvironment

enhanced by the NF-kB–activating signals of the DDR pathway
induced by platinum treatment.
Tumor-produced IL-6 induced the activation of the STAT3signaling pathway in M2 macrophages, a signaling pathway
that is known to be activated in tolerogenic APC (19, 20) In
contrast, STAT1 and STAT6 can support antitumor immunity
(18). We found a reduction of pSTAT1 and pSTAT6 in M2-like
macrophages and showed that this was PGE2 dependent.
These effects were enhanced when cancer cells were treated
with cisplatin and carboplatin and sustain the notion that
platinum-based chemotherapy may indirectly skew the local
immune environment to a more tolerogenic and tumor-promoting milieu in cancers actively producing PGE2 and/or IL-6.
In a mouse tumor model, platinum-based therapy caused
immunogenic cell death, thereby activating local APC and
enhancing antitumor T-cell responses. Cisplatin triggered the
release of the TLR4-stimulating protein HMGB-1 (43, 44). We
previously showed (9), and conﬁrm here, that tumor-induced
macrophages respond to the TLR4 agonist LPS as reﬂected by
the production of IL-10. Therefore, it is highly likely that
chemotherapy-mediated release of HMGB-1 may not only
activate DC, but activate local tumor-promoting macrophages
as well. Because tumor-associated macrophages can easily
outnumber tumor-inﬁltrating DC, the overall effect may be
less beneﬁcial in case there is an excess of M2 macrophages.
Chemoresistance was thought for a long time to arise as a
consequence of cell intrinsic genetic changes, including upregulation of drug efﬂux pumps, activation of detoxifying
enzymes, or apoptotic defects. Recent evidence suggests that
resistance to chemotherapy can also result from cell extrinsic
factors such as cytokines and growth factors (45), implying an

binding to and causing crosslinking of DNA and thus may
trigger the DDR pathway. Recently, several studies reported
that upon DDR, NF-kB activation may result in the production
of PGE2 and IL-6 (35, 36). More recently, it was shown that
excessive DNA damage-induced NF-kB activation promoted
expression of IL-6 in HELA cells (37). Upon chemotherapyinduced DDR, the I-kB kinase (IKK) complex phosphorylates
Ik-Ba for ubiquination and proteasomal degradation, thus
allowing the NF-kB complex to translocate to the nucleus
(18, 38). As the DDR pathway-activated NF-kB–mediated
production of PGE2 and IL-6 only occurred in tumor cell lines
originally producing sufﬁcient amounts of IL-6 and/or PGE2,
an autocrine role for these cytokines can be envisaged ref.
(39; Fig. 7).
STATs represent central regulators of cancer-associated
inﬂammation and inﬂuence interactions between cancer cells
and their immune microenvironment that determine whether
the inﬂammation promotes or inhibits cancer. The majority of
gynecologic tumors have high STAT3 activity and this was
associated with poor survival and chemoresistance (40). Interestingly, it has been reported that COX-2 is a transcriptional
target of STAT3 signaling (41). Furthermore, high COX-2
expression results in enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation in an
IL-6–dependent manner (42). Together, this may form an
autocrine mechanism. Notably, STAT3 and NF-kB interact at
multiple levels, thereby promoting protumorigenic inﬂammatory conditions in the tumor microenvironment (increased
PGE2 and IL-6 production), increasing tumor cell proliferation
and survival as well as chemoresistance, tumor angiogenesis,
and metastasis (18). Our data suggest that the autocrine
signaling loops of PGE2 and IL-6 in the tumor cells are

important role for the tumor microenvironment. Our data
support this hypothesis and suggest an immunologic explanation for the correlation of high COX-2 expression and IL-6
levels with poor response to treatment. We found no correlation of PGE2 and/or IL-6 production of the cancer cell lines
with chemoresistance of the cancer cell lines, whereas several
other studies show that high COX-2 expression and high levels
of IL-6 in serum and ascites identiﬁed patients with a poor
response to cisplatin and unfavorable prognosis (13, 17, 46).
This effect was explained by enhanced apoptosis resistance of
the cancer cells but this was not reﬂected by our in vitro tests
where cancer cell lines were incubated with different doses of
cisplatin and carboplatin. Our observation that platinumcontaining chemotherapy of cell lines with high COX-2
and/or IL-6 expression promoted the differentiation of monocytes to tumor-promoting M2-like macrophages substantiates
the notion that also cell extrinsic factors such as cytokines
play a role in chemoresistance (48). In our opinion, chemoresistance of a tumor may not only be mediated by the resistance of the cancer cells themselves but can occur through a
skewed tumor microenvironment that is geared to promote
tumor cell growth for instance through the action of M2
macrophages. This ﬁts well with the ﬁnding that in glioma, the
COX-2 pathway promotes gliomagenesis by supporting the
development of myeloid suppressor cells in the tumor microenvironment (47). If so, blocking the tumor-promoting effects
of PGE2 and IL-6 might even enhance the sensitivity of
otherwise more resistant tumors to chemotherapy, but this
will require new studies.
Previously, we showed that monocytes differentiated in the
presence of HELA, CC8, and CSCC7 or its supernatant induced
an M2-like phenotype and that treatment with indomethacin
(COX-inhibitor) and mAb against both IL-6 and IL-6R fully
restored their phenotype and functionality toward that of DC.
In recent clinical studies, where the effects of IL-6 were
targeted with the mAb siltuximab against IL-6, the results
were discordant (48–50). One explanation given was the fact
that if tumors produce high levels of IL-6, it will be difﬁcult to
neutralize all the soluble IL-6 present. In our experiments, we
used a mAb against both the cell-surface bound form and the
soluble form of the IL-6R called tocilizumab. This antibody,
which successfully blocks the detrimental effects of IL-6 in the
clinic when treating rheumatoid arthritis and Castleman disease (31, 32), was capable to fully block the effects of IL-6
produced by untreated or chemotherapy-treated tumor cells.
Pilot experiments revealed that this antibody to some extent
also blocked IL-6 signaling in the tumor cells themselves
(Supplemental Fig. S4).
In summary, chemoresistance of tumors have long been
associated with the activation of COX-2 and the production of
IL-6. Our data showed that tumor cells do not produce the
same levels of IL-6 and/or PGE2, and that there was no direct

correlation between the efﬁcacy of cisplatin and carboplatin
to kill tumor cells and the levels of these cytokines. In
contrast, we found that these chemotherapeutic compounds
elicited the NF-kB pathway leading to an increased production of PGE2 and IL-6 in tumors that actively produce these
inﬂammatory mediators. As IL-6 or PGE2 by themselves or in
combination can skew M2 macrophage differentiation, chemotherapeutic treatment of tumors will favor the differentiation of M2-like tolerogenic macrophages, despite the
differences in levels produced by tumor cells. In the end,
this will result in a stronger immune suppressive tumorpromoting tumor microenvironment known to be associated with therapy resistance (8). Therefore, our data suggest
that a chemotherapy-induced increase in the number of
intratumoral tumor-promoting M2 macrophages forms an
indirect mechanism underlying chemoresistance. Successful
blockers of PGE2 and the IL-6/IL-6R pathway are already in
the clinic. It will be of great interest to study the effects of a
combined therapy of cytotoxic agents and these clinically
available compounds in patients with apparently chemoresistant tumors.
