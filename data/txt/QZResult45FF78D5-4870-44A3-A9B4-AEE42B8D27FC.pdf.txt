ABSTRACT
Ovarian cancer is the most deadly gynecological malignancy since most patients
have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Therefore, identification of critical
pathways that contribute to ovarian cancer progression is necessary to yield novel
therapeutic targets. Recently we reported that the DNA binding protein ARID3B is
overexpressed in human ovarian tumors. To determine if ARID3B has oncogenic
functions in vivo, ovarian cancer cell lines stably expressing ARID3B were injected
intraperitoneally into nude mice. Overexpression of ARID3B increased tumor burden
and decreased survival. To assess how ARID3B contributes to the increased tumor
growth in vivo, we identified ARID3B induced genes in tumor ascites cells. ARID3B
induced expression of genes associated with metastasis and cancer stem cells (CD44,
LGR5, PROM1 (CD133), and Notch2). Moreover, ARID3B increased the number of
CD133+ (a cancer stem cell marker) cells compared to control cells. The increase
in CD133+ cells resulting from ARID3B expression was accompanied by enhanced
paclitaxel resistance. Our data demonstrate that ARID3B boosts production of CD133+
cells and increases ovarian cancer progression in vivo.

INTRODUCTION

survive and proliferate generating chemoresistant
tumors. CSCs have been isolated by a number of groups
from malignant ascites from ovarian cancer patients [311]. These cells express canonical stem cell markers,
are chemoresistant, and tumorigenic. One of the most
commonly reported CSC markers is CD133. CD133
expression is low in normal ovary and benign tumors
compared to malignant ovarian cancer [12]. Furthermore
CD133+ cells are more tumorigenic than CD133- cells,
suggesting that the CD133 population has stem cell
properties [13].
Recently we reported that the transcription factor
ARID3B, a member of the AT-rich interactive (ARID)
family [14], is overexpressed in serous ovarian cancer
[15]. In addition to being overexpressed in ovarian cancer
and late stage neuroblastoma [16], ARID3B is highly

Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from
a gynecological malignancy and resulted in an estimated
14,030 deaths in 2013 (American Cancer Society Facts
and Figures 2013). Patients initially respond well to
chemotherapy, but most patients will relapse after the
initial platinum/taxane therapy [1]. Understanding the
molecular mechanisms that drive malignancy is critical
for diagnosing and developing effective treatments for this
devastating disease.
Data indicate that cancer stem cells (CSC) contribute
to chemoresistance. CSCs are a subset of slow cycling
and undifferentiated cells that divide asymmetrically to
generate highly proliferative, invasive, and chemoresistant
tumor cells [2]. Following chemotherapy, the CSCs

expressed in embryonic (ES) and induced pluripotent
stem cells [17, 18]. In ES cells ARID3B interacts with
the stem cell factors Oct4 and Nanog [18]. Therefore we
hypothesized that ARID3B may contribute to ovarian
cancer growth by impacting cancer stem cell development.
To address this hypothesis, we assessed the role of
ARID3B in ovarian tumor growth and determined the
effects of ARID3B overexpression on gene expression and
drug resistance. We generated a xenograft mouse model
of ovarian cancer that recapitulates the level of ARID3B
overexpression found in human tumor sections. We found
that ARID3B increases tumor growth in vivo and induces
CSC genes in tumor ascites. Furthermore, ARID3B
overexpression increases the pool of CD133+ spheroids
in ovarian cancer cell lines. This study demonstrates
for the first time that ARID3B promotes ovarian tumor
development in part by regulating stem cell genes.

tumors. To do this we analyzed the expression levels
of ARID3B in human ovarian cancer by performing
immunohistochemistry (IHC) for ARID3B on ovarian
cancer tissue microarrays (TMAs). The TMAs contained
duplicate samples from 102 different patients of which 45
were serous. Unlike our previous TMA analysis that was
performed on commercially available TMAs, this TMA
data set had patient outcome with regards to tumor relapse,
survival, and time until survival. Using Aperio software,
we were able to blindly quantify the percentage of cells
with low, moderate, and high nuclear or cytoplasmic
staining. In order to rule out background staining, we only
further analyzed moderate and high staining (Figure 1A).
We found that out of 102 patients, 60 had moderate nuclear
ARID3B and relapsed; this correlation was significant
(p=0.025, t-test). Interestingly strong nuclear staining
did not correlate with relapse (p=0.15). We also found
that moderate nuclear ARID3B correlated significantly
with decreased time until relapse (p=0.029). We found no
correlation between ARID3B and stage, histological type,
or survival.
To recapitulate the overexpression of nuclear
ARID3B found in the human tumors we generated
xenografts in nude mice with ARID3B overexpressing
SKOV3IP cells. Refer to the nuclear expression of
ARID3B in Fig. 1. The SKOV3IP cell line is derived
from ascites cells that developed in a mouse injected
intraperitoneally (IP) with SKOV3 cells [20]. In a pilot
study, we transduced SKOV3IP cells with lentivirus
containing red fluorescent protein (RFP) or each of the
two ARID3B splice forms. ARID3B has an alternative

RESULTS
Generation of xenograft mouse model of ARID3B
overexpression in SKOV3IP ovarian cancer cells
Recently we demonstrated that ARID3B is
significantly overexpressed in ovarian cancer compared
to normal ovarian surface epithelium and benign ovarian
tumors [19]. We wanted to establish a xenograft model
of ovarian cancer in mice where ARID3B is expressed
at comparable levels to what is observed in human

splice form, ARID3BSH. Since it lacks 81% of the DNA
binding domain [15] it was included in our analysis as a
negative control. These cells are referred to as SKOV3IPRFP, SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL, and SKOV3IP-ARID3BSH.
Cells from each cohort were injected IP into nude mice
and were allowed to grow for 3 weeks. By 3 weeks
the SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL cells formed large tumors,
mice were euthanized, and tumors were fixed. IHC was
performed to compare the expression of ARID3B in
SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL tumors to human tumors. This
analysis showed that the level of nuclear ARID3B in
SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL tumors was similar to what was
observed in 88% of human ovarian tumors (Figure 1A
and B). The SKOV3IP-ARID3B xenograft tumors mimic
the overexpression of ARID3B found in human ovarian
cancer.

(Supplemental Table 1). Survival analysis showed that
the median survival for SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL tumor
bearing mice was significantly reduced compared to mice
bearing SKOV3IP-RFP or SKOV3IP-ARID3BSH tumors
(RFP=51 days, ARID3BSH=52 days, ARID3BFL=36
days; P=0.0074) (Figure 2E). Collectively, these data
demonstrate that overexpression of ARID3BFL results in
a more aggressive ovarian cancer phenotype in vivo.

ARID3B increases cell adhesion but not
proliferation or invasion
We wanted to define the mechanisms by which
ARID3B increases tumorigenesis. We performed IHC
analysis for proliferation marker Ki67 and apoptosis
marker cleaved Parp1 (Supplemental Figure 2) on RFP
and ARID3BFL tumors. We did not find any difference in
Ki67 staining. We actually detected more cleaved Parp1
in the ARID3B overexpressing tumors. We believe this
was a due to the tumors being quite large and having
large avascular regions. We counted the number of blood
vessels in sections of SKOV3IP-RFP and SKOV3IPARID3BFL xenografts and found no statistical difference
between the two. These data suggest that the increase in
tumor burden resulting from ARID3B expression is not
increased proliferation or decreased apoptosis.
We next assessed if ARID3B enhances tumor
development in vivo by altering cells intrinsic phenotypes.
We analyzed SKOV3 and SKOV3IP parental, RFP,
ARID3BFL, and ARID3BSH expressing cells for
changes in proliferation and invasion. We discovered that
ARID3BFL and ARID3BSH did not affect proliferation
(Supplemental Figure 3A, B) or invasion in vitro
(Supplemental Figure 3C, D). We found that the cells
expressing ARID3BFL had increased cellular projections
and altered actin organization (Supplemental Figure
4A. B). Furthermore, ARID3BFL but not ARID3BSH
increased adhesion to a wide range of extracellular
matrix proteins (Supplemental Figure 4C) and increased
vitronectin haptotaxis (Supplemental Figure 4D). The
results indicate that ARID3B alters cell-matrix adhesion,
which may contribute to increased tumor growth in vivo.

ARID3BFL increases tumor burden in vivo
In our initial xenograft study we observed that
ARID3BFL expressing tumors were considerably larger
than the controls. We therefore repeated this study to
determine how ARID3B influenced tumor growth,
survival, and gene expression. We performed 2 separate
experiments using cells that were transduced with RFP
or ARID3B. Western blot of the SKOV3IP cells in both
experiments is in shown in Figure 2A (compare parental
and RFP controls in lanes 4-6 to SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL
cells in lanes 7 and 8). Female nude (nu/nu) mice were IP
injected with 106 SKOV3IP-RFP, SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL,
or SKOV3IP-ARID3BSH cells. Beginning 10 days after
IP injection of the SKOV3IP tumor cells, fluorescent in
vivo imaging of tumor growth was conducted weekly. A
representative image of four mice from each of the three
groups at 31 days post injection (Figure 2B) demonstrates
that the mice injected with SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL cells
developed large tumors earlier than the mice injected
with SKOV3IP-RFP or SKOV3IP-ARID3BSH cells. A
montage of images of representative mice between 18-39d
(when all the SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL injected mice had
died) is shown in Supplemental Figure 1. In contrast to the
SKOV3IP-RFP and SKOV3IP-ARID3BSH injected mice,
SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL mice also frequently presented
with distended abdomens with large tumors visible
beneath the skin (Figure 2C).
Mice were euthanized when they progressed to
the point where the tumors were very large. Then the
tumors were isolated and dissected from the organs.
Figure 2D shows the representative tumor burden from
each group of mice. Quantification of tumor weight
revealed that the SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL tumors were
on average more than 2.5x larger than those collected
from the SKOV3IP-RFP mice. The average weights
of the tumors were 1.91g+/-0.33 for SKOV3IP-RFP
tumors, 3.22g+/-0.47 for SKOV3IP ARID3BSH tumors,
and 5.46g+/-0.49 for SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL tumors

ARID3B induces expression of cancer stem cell
associated genes
ARID3B is a DNA binding protein [14, 21],
however how ARID3B regulates tumor pathways has not
been investigated. Therefore, we performed a microarray
to identify putative ARID3B regulated genes that are
induced by ARID3B in our tumor model. For this study
RNA was isolated from ascites cells present in the mouse
xenografts. We chose to use these cells because ascites
fluid contains CSCs, which contribute to aggressive tumor
behavior and because ARID3B is found in stem cell

populations [3-11]. Isolated ascites cells were subsequently
cultured ex vivo to remove non-tumor cells. We confirmed
that the ex vivo cultures contained only SKOV3IP-RFP
or SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL cells by examining the cells for
RFP expression via fluorescent microscopy. Microarray
was performed on RNA isolated from ascites cells from
three independent SKOV3IP-RFP injected mice and three
independent SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL injected mice. The top
35 upregulated genes in the SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL ascites
are shown in Supplemental Table 2. Pathway analysis
using Ingenuity Systems IPA software demonstrates that
the top three biological functions that are associated with
ARID3BFL induced genes are Cell Death and Survival,
Cellular Movement, and Cancer. We used qRT-PCR
to confirm that two of the most highly induced genes
COL1A1 and COL1A2 were indeed induced in our ascites
samples from SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL tumors compared
to the RFP tumors (Figure 3 A and B). Alterations in
the expression of collagen genes are associated with
metastasis in ovarian cancer [22]. Importantly COL1A1
is both associated with CSCs and contributes to ovarian
cancer chemoresistance [23, 24]. COL1A2 exhibits altered
expression in several tumor types most notably gastric
cancer [25]. Interestingly, 6 of the top 35 genes have
been implicated in CSCs (supplemental table 2). Table 1
lists ARID3B induced CSC genes including ST3GAL6,
ADAM19, and HTATIP2, which were shown to be part of

the CSC signature found in serous ovarian cancer ascites
[10]. To validate these findings qRT-PCR was performed
for WISP1, LGR5, SFRP1, and SNAI2, which are in the
Wnt signaling pathway that is implicated in CSCs [26,
27] and metastasis [28]. Expression of these genes was
significantly increased in the ARID3BFL expressing tumor
cells (Figure 3C-F). To determine whether ARID3BFL
overexpression regulates these genes in other ovarian
cancer cell lines, we performed qRT-PCR for SFRP1
and WISP1 on OVCA429 cells transduced with RFP or
ARID3B. Expression of ARID3B in OVCA429 cells is
shown in Supplemental Figure 5. As anticipated, ARID3B
overexpressing OVCA429 cells exhibited significantly
increased SFRP1 and WISP1 expression (Figure 3G and

H). These data suggest that ARID3BFL regulates genes
involved in CSC gene signature.

ARID3B increases the expression of cancer stem
cell markers
The finding that ARID3B regulates stem cell
associated genes is particularly intriguing as ARID3B is
expressed in ES cells in a protein complex with the stem
cell transcription factors Nanog, Oct4 and Nac1[18]. Since
ARID3B is expressed in stem cells and associates with
stem cell factors, we hypothesized that ARID3B promotes
tumor growth through the regulation of a CSC phenotype.
To determine if ARID3BFL increases production of CSCs,

CD44 and CD133 demonstrates an increase in CD44+/CD133+ cells in the SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL (N=5) cells compared to SKOV3IP (N=3)
or SKOV3IP-RFP (N=3) cell populations. (SKOV3IP vs. SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL P=0.0037; SKOV3IP-RFP vs. SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL

SKOV3IP and SKOV3IP-RFP cells respectively. (C) qRT-PCR performed on SKOV3IP-RFP, SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL, and SKOV3IPARID3BSH ascites cells show that PROM1 is significantly increased in SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL (N=11) cells with a 27-fold increase over
both SKOV3IP-RFP (N=5) and SKOV3IP-ARID3BSH (N=12) cells. (D) qRT-PCR was performed on OVCA429-RFP and OVCA429ARDI3BFL cells for PROM1. (E) SKOV3, SKOV3-RFP, and SKOV3-ARID3BFL cells were treated with increasing concentrations of

the cells that were injected into the nude mice to generate
xenografts and the parental cells (SKOV3IP, SKOV3IPRFP and SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL) cells were examined
for the expression of the stem cell markers CD44 and
CD133 using flow cytometry [29, 30]. Flow cytometry
scatter plots in Figure 4A demonstrate the percentage of
CD44+ (Y-axis) and CD133+ cells (X-axis). This analysis
revealed that the cell populations expressing both CD44
and CD133 (PROM1) are significantly increased in the
SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL cells (Figure 4A and B), suggesting
that ARID3B increases the population of cells that express
CD133 and therefore may be CSCs. In addition, qRT-PCR
for PROM1 demonstrated increased expression (p<0.001)
in the cells from SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL ascites cells
compared to SKOV3IP-RFP and SKOV3IP-ARID3BSH
ascites cells (Figure 4C). Furthermore, ARID3BFL also
increased PROM1 gene expression in OVCA429 cells
(Figure 4D). Thus these data suggest that ARID3B
increases the population of CD133+ cells, that have been
previously demonstrated to have enhanced tumorigenic
capabilities[13].
Next, because CD133+ cells are associated with
chemoresistance we ascertained the impact of ARID3B on
drug resistance [7, 30, 31]. We chose to evaluate the effects
of ARID3BFL overexpression on sensitivity to paclitaxel,
which is used in first-line chemotherapy for ovarian
cancer and SKOV3 cells already display resistance to
cisplatin (the other drug used in first-line chemotherapy).
ARID3BFL overexpressing cells showed a significant

increase in viability compared to parental and RFP
control cells when treated with 0.01-100µM paclitaxel
for 48h (Figure 4E). We also evaluated cell for response
to cisplatin and found no difference between parental,
RFP, and ARID3B expressing cells (Supplemental Figure
6). Therefore, ARID3B overexpression enhances drug
resistance, which is a well-known property of CSCs.
Lastly we assessed if ARID3B overexpression
facilitates expansion of spheroids expressing stem
cell markers using our modification of a published
protocol [32], which is in press at Journal of Visualized
Experiments (Cole, et al). We selected for chemoresistant
ovarian cancer spheroids by culturing cells in cisplatin and
subsequently culturing the non-adherent cells in a stem
cell media. Viable spheroids expressed elevated CD133
(Figure 5). Exogenous ARID3B expression significantly
increased the expression of PROM1 in CSCs compared
to non-CSCs as well as parental and RFP control CSCs
(Figure 5A). ARID3B expression was associated with
an increase in the percentage of CD117+/CD133+ CSCs
in SKOV3 CSC cultures (Figure 5B). These studies
indicate that ARID3B may contribute to ovarian cancer
tumorigenesis and therapeutic resistance by regulating
CSC production or function.

DISCUSSION
We previously demonstrated that ARID3B is
overexpressed in human serous ovarian cancer [19].

However, it was not known if ARID3B expression might
enhance ovarian cancer tumorgenicity as it does for
neuroblastoma [16]. To address the role of ARID3B in
ovarian tumorigenesis, we performed mouse xenograft
assays using SKOV3IP cells expressing exogenous
ARID3BFL at levels similar to what is observed with IHC
in human cancer. Our data demonstrates for the first time
that ARID3B increases ovarian cancer tumor growth in
a xenograft model of ovarian cancer. Mice injected with
SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL cells have significantly more
tumor burden and decreased survival compared to those
injected with SKOV3IP-RFP or SKOV3IP-ARID3BSH
cells. Although, the xenografts were only performed using
SKOV3IP cells, we have found that ARID3B regulates
CSC genes in OVCA429 cells. Additionally, we found
that A2780 cells that expressed ARID3BFL formed
subcutaneous tumors (4/5 mice) more efficiently than
ones expressing RFP alone (1/5 mice). Future studies of
ARID3B regulation of tumorigenesis and gene regulation
in HGSOC cell lines are ongoing and will enable us to
better dissect the contribution of ARID3B to ovarian
cancer.
Many of the mice bearing SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL
xenografts developed distended abdomens filled with
ascites. Because ascites are a rich source of CSCs and
ARID3B had previously been implicated in stem cell
function[18], we explored the possibility that ARID3B
increases CSC production. Microarray analysis on ascites
cells from SKOV3IP-RFP or SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL
xenografts identified that ARID3B overexpression is
associated with elevated expression of many stem cell
markers and metastasis associated genes. We observed
up-regulation of genes in the Wnt signaling pathway
(LGR5, SFRP1, and WISP1), which is associated with
CSCs [27, 30, 33]. Similarly ARID3B overexpressing
cells exhibited increased expression of genes (ST3GAL6,
ADAM19, and HTATIP2) reported to be part of the serous
ovarian cancer ascites CSC signature [10]. The increase in
CSCs in culture corresponded to an increase in paclitaxel
resistance. This is particularly interesting since CD133
is significantly elevated in recurrent platinum-resistant
tumors [30]. Our results suggest that overexpression of
ARID3BFL increases the percentage of tumor cells that
posses “stem like” qualities and this leads to resistance to
paclitaxel therapy.
Since ARID3B is a DNA binding protein, we
predict that some of the phenotypes that are attributed to
ARID3B expression and activation are through its ability
to directly and indirectly regulate gene transcription.
Ongoing studies will determine which stem cell genes
are directly regulated by ARID3B promoter association.
Interestingly, with ARID3B overexpression we see a
substantial increase in CD133 mRNA; however, while
we only observe a small yet significant increase in
CD133+ (cell surface) cells (from 0.2-1.25%). More
cells are expressing CD133 mRNA than have the “stemwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cell phenotype”. This suggests that the CD133 mRNA
may not be translated or transported to the cell surface,
the reason for this is not known. The role of CD133 in
stem cell production or function is not clear and warrants
future investigations. Alternatively, ARID3B may activate
a stem cell program, but progeny cells further divide and
“differentiate” or lose their stem cell markers. This may
impart explain the heterogeneity in the tumor population.
Therefore ARID3B induces stem cell genes, which may
contribute to the increased tumor production in xenografts
expressing ARID3BFL.
We found that moderate, but not high expression
of ARID3B in the nucleus significantly correlates with
ovarian cancer relapse. This agrees with our published data
demonstrating that exceedingly high levels of ARID3B
lead to TNF-mediated apoptosis [15]. In contrast, more
moderate levels of overexpression (observed in the cell
lines used in these studies) leads to a more aggressive
form of ovarian cancer. In conclusion, our studies reveal
that ARID3BFL increases the aggressiveness of ovarian
tumor formation and decreases survival time in vivo. We
propose that one mechanism for ARID3B enhancement of
tumor growth is through activation of genes involved in
CSC pathways leading to CSC production and paclitaxel
resistance.

MATERIALS & METHODS
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and H&E
Three TMAs containing ovarian cancer sections
were provided by Dr. Tanja Pejovic (Oregon Health and
Science University). These TMAs contained section
from102 different cases. IHC was performed on paraffin
embedded tumors according to the staining procedure
provided by the VECTASTAIN ABC KIT using
ImmPACT DAB and Hematoxylin QS as a counterstain
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Anti-ARID3B
IHC Antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery,
TX), anti-KI67 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), and
Cleaved PARP (Asp214) (Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, MA) were used. Slides were scanned at the
20x magnification setting using Aperio Scan Scope
(Vista, CA). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was
performed on xenograft tumors from SKOV3IP-RFP and
SKOV3IP-RFP cells injections according to standard
procedures.

Cell Culture
SKOV3 cells were obtained from ATCC

ml streptomycin. SKOV3IP cell line (from Dr. Mills, MD
Anderson Cancer Center), was maintained in RPMI-1640
medium supplemented with 0.1mM L-glutamine, 5%
FBS, 50U/ml penicillin and 50µg/ml streptomycin, 1%
non-essential amino acids, and 1mM Sodium pyruvate
and Hygromycin B. OVCA429 cells were provided by
Dr. Bast (MD Anderson Cancer Center) and grown in
minimal essential media with 0.1mM L-glutamine, 10%
FBS, 50U/ml penicillin and 50µg/ml streptomycin. Red
fluorescent protein (RFP), ARID3BFL and ARID3BSH
were overexpressed using a lentiviral approach as
described [15]. Antibiotic selection was not used as nearly
100% of the cells were transduced with the lentivirus. For
in vivo and in vitro studies, cells were transduced with
virus, expanded and injected into mice or used for other
experiments within 2-3 weeks. Tissue culture reagents
were obtained from Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA. All
cell lines were authenticated on October 1, 2013, ATCC
by STR profiling.

imaged twice weekly and then euthanized. Ascites fluid
was collected using a 25 G needle and 5 mL syringe. If no
ascites fluid was present a peritoneal wash was performed
by injecting 2 mL of PBS IP and then collecting the fluid.
Fluorescent imaging of tumor growth in live animals were
acquired at the Notre Dame Integrated Imaging Facility
using the Multispectral FX (Carestream, Rochester, NY

RNA extraction and qRT-PCR
Gene array (see Supplemental information) and
qRT-PCR analysis was conducted on tumor derived ascites
cells from SKOV3IP-RFP and SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL
injected mice. Ascites cells were collected from the mice
as described above. Half of the fluid was centrifuged to
pellet the cells. The supernatant was removed and the cells
were placed in 0.5 mL of TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). The remaining ascites fluid was cultured as described
for SKOV3IP cells. The RNA was extracted using TRIzol
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. cDNA
was prepared using the High Capacity cDNA kit (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) . qRT-PCR was performed
using Taqman master mix solution (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA) and primers for Col1A1, Col1A2,
ARID3B, PROM1, LGR5, SFRP1, WISP1, and SNAI2
from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and
GAPDH from (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). qRT-PCR was
conducted in duplicate using the Biorad CFX96 C1000
System (Biorad, Hercules, CA). Statistics were calculated
using a one-way ANOVA.

Western Blot Analysis
Whole cell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer
(50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5%
EDTA, 0.1% SDS and protease inhibitors). Bicinchoninic
Acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL)
determined protein concentrations. Thirty µg of whole cell
lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to
nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blotted with
ARID3B antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery,
TX: Cat# A302-564A), and Histone H3 (D1H2) antibody
(Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) for loading control.
Densitometry analysis was performed on three blots using
BIORAD Chemidoc XRS+ System Image Lab Software
(Hercules, CA).

Flow Cytometry
To examine stem cell markers in SKOV3IP cells
expressing ARID3BFL or control cells, flow cytometry
was performed to detect CD133 and CD44 and data were
analyzed with FlowJo software (Ashland, OR). SKOV3IP,
SKOV3IP-RFP, and SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL cells were
incubated with CD133/(AC133)-PE (Miltenyi Biotec,
Auburn, CA) and anti-human CD44-APC (Biolegend,
San Diego, CA). N=3. Statistics were calculated using a
one-way ANOVA. Expression of CD117and CD133 was
evaluated in SKOV3 CSC and SKOV3 (Control) cells that
were either non-transduced or stably expressing RFP or
ARID3B. Cells were harvested with Accumax (Millipore,
Billerica, MA), and washed twice with cold PBS. Cells
were incubated in their respective media for 1 h prior to
labeling. Cells were suspended in 0.1%BSA/PBS and
labeled with anti-CD 133-PE (Mitenyl Biotec, Auburn,
CA) and anti-CD117-FITC (anti-CD117-Biotin; Cell
Signaling, Danvers, MA and Streptavidin-FITC; Mitenyl
Biotec, Auburn, CA) per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cells were fixed overnight in 1% paraformaldehyde.
Flow cytometry was performed using a Beckman Coulter
FC500 Flow Cytometer (Brea, CA). N=3 Statistics were

Xenograft mouse models of ovarian cancer
Under an approved IACUC protocol (ND #14-060),
six-week-old female nude mice nu/nu (Charles River,
Wilmington, MA) were maintained at the Freimann
Life Science Center (University of Notre Dame). In the
pilot study (4 mice per group), 2x106 SKOV3IP-RFP,
SKOV3IP-ARID3BFL, and SKOV3IP-ARID3BSH
cells in 300 μl of phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 137
mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, and 11.9 mM phosphate buffer,
pH 7.4) were injected intraperitoneally (IP) into nude
mice. Mice had visible tumors after 3 weeks and were
euthanized. For the survival studies and analysis of tumor
growth, 1x106 SKOV3IP-RFP (9 mice), SKOV3IPARID3BFL (16 mice), and SKOV3IP-ARID3BSH (14
mice) cells in 300 μl of PBS cells were each injected into
nude mice. Two separate experiments were conducted on
independent transductions of the cells. Mice were imaged
weekly. When the mice showed signs of illness they were

Enrichment for Cancer Stem Cells
CSC cultures using SKOV3, SKOV3-RFP, and
SKOV3-ARID3B cells, were generated by treating cells
with 20μM of cisplatin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 72h.
Surviving cells were trypsinized and cultured in serum
free DMEM/F12 media (Life Technologies, Grand Island,
NY) supplemented 5μg/ml insulin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
USA), 10 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth
factor (EGF; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA), 10 ng/ml basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
USA), 12 ng/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; Santa
Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) and 0.4% bovine
serum albumin (BSA; Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The
selected cells formed non-adherent spheres when grown
in this condition. The media was changed every 2 days.
SKOV3 CSCs were collected for RNA analysis and flow
cytometry.
