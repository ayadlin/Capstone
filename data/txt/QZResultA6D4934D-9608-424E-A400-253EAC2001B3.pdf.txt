ABSTRACT
Receptor-PI3K-mTORC1 signaling and fatty acid synthase (FASN)-regulated
lipid biosynthesis harbor numerous drug targets and are molecularly connected. We
hypothesize that unraveling the mechanisms of pathway cross-talk will be useful for
designing novel co-targeting strategies for ovarian cancer (OC). The impact of receptorPI3K-mTORC1 onto FASN is already well-characterized. However, reverse actions–from
FASN towards receptor-PI3K-mTORC1–are still elusive. We show that FASN-blockade
impairs receptor-PI3K-mTORC1 signaling at multiple levels. Thin-layer chromatography
and MALDI-MS/MS reveals that FASN-inhibitors (C75, G28UCM) augment polyunsaturated
fatty acids and diminish signaling lipids diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidylinositol
3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) in OC cells (SKOV3, OVCAR-3, A2780, HOC-7). Western
blotting and micropatterning demonstrate that FASN-blockers impair phosphorylation/
expression of EGF-receptor/ERBB/HER and decrease GRB2–EGF-receptor recruitment
leading to PI3K-AKT suppression. FASN-inhibitors activate stress response-genes
HIF-1α-REDD1 (RTP801/DIG2/DDIT4) and AMPKα causing mTORC1- and S6-repression.
We conclude that FASN-inhibitor-mediated blockade of receptor-PI3K-mTORC1
occurs due to a number of distinct but cooperating processes. Moreover, decrease of
PI3K-mTORC1 abolishes cross-repression of MEK-ERK causing ERK activation.
Consequently, the MEK-inhibitor selumetinib/AZD6244, in contrast to the PI3K/mTORinhibitor dactolisib/NVP-BEZ235, increases growth inhibition when given together with
a FASN-blocker. We are the first to provide deep insight on how FASN-inhibition blocks
ERBB-PI3K-mTORC1 activity at multiple molecular levels. Moreover, our data encourage
therapeutic approaches using FASN-antagonists together with MEK-ERK-inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

Here we demonstrate that blockade of FASN activates
the mTORC1 repressors REDD1 and AMPKα causing
mTORC1 downstream inhibition. This is accompanied
by compensatory MAPK ERK activation. Accordingly,
combination of' FASN-blockers with MAPK pathway
inhibitors yields stronger growth inhibition than single
FASN-inhibitor treatment. Herewith, we provide the first
in-depth analysis on how FASN-inhibition blocks ERBBPI3K-mTORC1 activity at various molecular levels.

Ovarian cancer (OC) represents the most
lethal malignancy of the female reproductive system
[1–3]. Although new anticancer drugs have significantly
improved the five-year survival of OC, overall mortality yet
remains invariably high [4]. Thus, a deeper understanding
of the molecular background of OC is required. Many
OCs harbor hyperactive oncogenic drivers in the ERBBphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(PI3K)-mechanistic target
of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway.
They exhibit ‘PI3Kness’ and are sensitive to drugs
that target this pathway [5, 6]. ERBB-PI3K-mTORC1
controls diverse cellular functions including proliferation,
survival, growth, migration, autophagy, angiogenesis,
metabolism, and energy balance  [7]. At the molecular
level, ERBB membrane receptors activate PI3K, which
converts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)
to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3).
PIP3 stimulates AKT, which then inactivates TSC2 [8].
Thereby, the TSC1/2 tumor suppressor complex loses
its ability to block RHEB–the upstream activator of
mTORC1–and enables mTORC1 downstream signaling.
S6K1 and 4EBP1 are the main targets of mTORC1 and
control cell division and protein biosynthesis. TSC1/2
functions as a regulator of cell homeostasis. It receives
activating inputs from REDD1 (DDIT4, RTP801) and
AMPK–two sensors of nutritive and energetic shortage,
which counteract AKT-mediated induction of mTORC1
and block cell proliferation.
Cancer cells require large amounts of proteins,
nucleotides, lipids and energy for growth. In recent
years, the reprogramming occurring in cancer
cell metabolic networks has gained considerable
attention. Research in this field will likely generate
new concepts for improved anticancer treatment.
For instance, lipid biosynthesis has been found to be
hyperactive in most malignant tissues. Hence, fatty
acid synthase (FASN), the enzyme responsible for
de novo lipogenesis, is overexpressed in tumors including
OC and is considered a useful tumor marker. It signifies
unfavorable outcome and represents a hallmark of
cancer [9–12]. At the biochemical level, acetyl-CoA is
generated from citrate and is further processed to malonylCoA. Both CoA-conjugates are used by FASN to form
the saturated long-chain fatty acid palmitic acid (PA;
16 : 0) [10]. Blockade of FASN has been demonstrated
to exert anticancer effects in human OC [11] and thus
represents an appealing strategy for treatment.
Available data suggest that ERBB-PI3K-mTORC1
up-regulates FASN by induction of the transcription
factor SREBP-1c [13]. We recently demonstrated that
FASN in turn can stimulate PI3K-mTORC1 signaling and
contrariwise blockade of FASN impairs PI3K-mTORC1
[14, 15]. However, the mechanisms of this inhibitory action
from FASN onto ERBB-PI3K-mTORC1 remain elusive.

RESULTS
OC cell lines reveal diverse sensitivities against
FASN-inhibitors
We and others have shown that FASN-inhibitor
sensitivities and FASN protein expression levels correlate
with each other, while differing markedly between
individual OC cell lines [12–16]. Thus, the IC50 values for
growth inhibition after 72 h exposure to the prototypic
FASN-inhibitor C75 or to the more advanced compound
G28UCM vary considerably in the cell lines used (IC50
of C75: HOC-7 = 29 ± 1 µM, SKOV3 = 27 ± 5 µM,
OVCAR-3 = 18 ± 3 µM, A2780 = 22 ± 5 µM; IC50 of
G28UCM: HOC-7 = 21 ± 1 µM, SKOV3 = 10 ± 3 µM,
OVCAR-3 = 4 ± 1 µM, A2780 = 3 ± 1 µM) (Supplementary
Figure 1). Therefore, isoeffective instead of identical drug
concentrations have to be used for comparison of FASNinhibitor effects in different cell lines. For instance, 72 h of
exposure to 40, 25, 20 or 10 µM G28UCM, or to 40, 35,
20 or 30 µM C75 yield roughly similar growth inhibition
(60–70 %) in SKOV3, HOC-7, OVCAR-3 or A2780 cells,
respectively.

FASN-inhibitors down-regulate oleic acid (OA),
diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidylinositol
3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), but elevate
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and
malonyl-CoA
Acetyl-CoA carboxylase converts acetyl-CoA to
malonyl-CoA. Both intermediates are used by FASN to
generate the saturated fatty acid (FA) palmitic acid (PA
(16 : 0)), which is the source for most other lipids including
monounsaturated FA (MUFA) oleic acid (OA (18 : 1(9Z))).
Blockade of FASN therefore leads to loss of FAs and to
accumulation of malonyl-CoA (Figure 1A). Both conditions
can be harmful to the cells [17]. We demonstrate that addition
of exogenous OA, unlike PA, partially abolishes FASNinhibitor-mediated growth arrest and apoptosis (Figure 1B,
1C). Inhibitors of acetyl-CoA carboxylase such as TOFA, on
the other hand, induce FA deficiency without accumulation
of malonyl-CoA and impair OC cell growth only at very
high concentrations (Figure 1D). These data suggest that
cytotoxicity of FASN-blockers is most likely mediated by
both OA deprivation and malonyl-CoA accumulation.

Next we applied thin-layer chromatography for
mapping the effects of FASN-inhibition on the major lipid
classes. DAG is formed by cleavage of phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) [18] and transfers signals from
membrane receptors to protein kinase C (PKC). DAG
is also a precursor of membrane glycerophospholipids
and plays a key role in de novo lipogenesis and lipid
remodeling in cancer [19]. Interestingly, DAG levels
are decreased after 8 h of exposure to G28UCM (−54%
in SKOV3, −5% in OVCAR-3). This is followed by a
transient rebound at 24 h (+65% in SKOV3, +15% in
OVCAR-3) and a subsequent decline leading to severe
depletion at 72 h (−70% in SKOV3, −67% in OVCAR-3)
(Figure 2). A similar down-regulation of DAG is also seen
when cells are exposed to C75, the other FASN-inhibitor
(Supplementary Figure 2). Our data corroborate recent
findings [20] demonstrating that downregulation of DAG
is essential for growth inhibition by FASN-inhibitors.

While oncogenic functions of FASN, DAG, PKC,
PIPs, and PI3K-mTORC1 have already been demonstrated,
the influence of FASN(-inhibitors) on phosphatidylinositol
(PI) metabolism and signaling in cancer is still unknown
[10, 21–23]. To address these issues we employed a matrixassisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-hybrid
quadrupole iontrap (QIT)-time-of-flight (TOF)-tandemmass spectrometry(MS/MS) based lipidomics screening
approach [24]. A transient rise of total PI after 8 h treatment
with G28UCM is followed by a sharp decline (Figure 3A,
3B). PI regulation is seen with both inhibitors in both cell
lines, albeit it is less pronounced in SKOV3 (cf. Figure 3A,
3C with Figure 3B, 3D). MALDI-MS/MS fragment ion
analysis was used to determine the fatty acid composition
of the individual PI species. Approximately 20 peaks
representing the most prominent PI species are found in the
mass range between m/z 800–920 (Supplementary Table 1
and Supplementary Figure 3). Lipid species containing mainly

Figure 1: The degrees of accumulation of malonyl-CoA and depletion of oleic acid (OA) upon inhibition of fatty acid
synthase (FASN) in ovarian cancer (OC) cells depend on the particular inhibitors used. (A) Malonyl-CoA is quickly and

strongly accumulated by G28UCM, but much less by C75. (B) Supplementation of OA, unlike PA, antagonizes C75-mediated growth
inhibition more efficiently than G28UCM-mediated growth inhibition. Data obtained after exposure to C75 (80 µM for SKOV3 and
HOC-7, 40 µM for OVCAR-3) or G28UCM (80 µM for SKOV3, 15 µM for OVCAR-3, 30 µM for HOC-7) ± 70 µM OA or PA are presented.
1.5 × 10³ (SKOV3, OVCAR-3) or 0.5 × 10³ (HOC-7) cells/well were seeded in a 96 well plate and treated for 72 h. Note: In these
experiments cultures contained bovine serum albumin (for details of dissolving fatty acids see Materials and methods), which lowers the
efficacy of FASN-inhibitors [38]. Therefore, higher concentrations of C75 and G28UCM had to be applied in order to achieve marked
inhibition of cell growth. Data from untreated controls (not shown in chart) were set to 100% and those from treated cultures were related
to it. Means ± SD, n = 3. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 FASN-inhibitor alone vs. FASN-inhibitor combined with OA or PA. One-way

OA (18:1(9Z)) are decreased, while those containing PUFAs
like arachidonic acid (20 : 4 (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)) are increased
after FASN-inhibition (Figure 3E, 3F). PI is precursor of all
PI phosphates. Here we focus on PI 4-phosphate (PIP), PI
4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3).
These phospholipids control crucial steps in cancer cell
signaling [25]. FASN-inhibitors elevate PIP and/or PIP2
levels in SKOV3, but diminish them in OVCAR-3 cells
(Figure 4A, 4B). Nevertheless, the drug-mediated changes
of the FA composition of PIP2 are similar in both cell lines
and correspond to those seen in PI, i.e. enrichment of PUFAs
(e.g. arachidonic acid) and depletion of MUFAs (e.g. OA)
(Figure 4C, 4D and Supplementary Figure 4). PI3K activates
the PI3K-mTOR signaling cascade by phosphorylating PIP2
to PIP3. Using a PIP3-specific ELISA we demonstrate that
FASN-inhibitory drugs strongly diminish the cellular amount
of PIP3 in OC cells (Figure 4E, 4F).

hours and reaches statistical significance after 24 hours of
treatment (Figure 5B).

HIF-1α/REDD1 and AMPK link FASN-blockade
to mTORC1 suppression and growth inhibition
Western blotting was used to examine FASN-blockermediated inhibition of PI3K-AKT-mTORC1. Thereby,
we aimed to identify effector molecules that directly link
FASN pathways to mTORC1. In SKOV3 cells treated with
G28UCM we observed a rapid dose-dependent induction
of HIF-1α and of its target gene, the stress response
protein REDD1 (DDIT4, RTP801) (Figure 6A). Figure 7A
reveals that blockade of HIF-1α with the specific inhibitor
LW6 prevents G28UCM-mediated induction of REDD1
indicating that REDD1 up-regulation is mediated by
HIF-1α. Accordingly, both proteins accumulate within
the first hour of FASN-inhibition. However, after 72 h,
both HIF-1α and REDD1 are decreased relative to control
cells (Figure 6A). Concurrently, phosphorylation of
AMPK, which signifies shortage of bioenergy, becomes
stimulated. Both REDD1 and pAMPK are repressors of
mTORC1. Consequently, phosphorylation of the mTORC1
effector ribosomal protein S6 is decreasing as soon as
REDD1 is up-regulated and remains low due to ensuing
suppression through pAMPK. Reduction of mTOR and of
the mTOR binding partner DEPTOR has been observed
after 2–3 days of treatment confirming robust impairment
of the mTOR pathway (Figure 6A, 6B). Cleaved fragments
of caspase 3 and PARP–two hallmarks of apoptosis–
occur approximately 24 h post-treatment. At that time
mTORC1 activity has already been impaired (Figure 6A).
Similar molecular changes are found in G28UCM-and
C75-treated A2780 or OVCAR-3 cells (Supplementary
Figure 5). Moreover, the effects are independent of the
presence or absence of exogenous growth factors and can
also be observed after RNAi knock-down of the FASN
gene (Figure 6B and Supplementary Figure 6). Genetic
knock-down of REDD1 or AMPKα1/2 reverts G28UCMmediated mTOR dephosphorylation and growth arrest

FASN-inhibitors impair GRB2 recruitment to
the EGF receptor
Signal initiating molecules such as the epidermal
growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase
are embedded in multi-molecular complexes that are
anchored in membrane microdomains known as lipid
rafts. FASN-blockade lowers the membrane lipid content.
This leads to decomposition of the lipid rafts [26] and to
reduced receptor phosphorylation [14]. Here we applied
a live-cell micropatterning assay [27–29] to evaluate
the role of FASN-blockade on recruitment of GRB2 to
EGFR. SKOV3 cells co-expressing EGFR-CFP and
GRB2-YFP were grown on anti-EGFR antibody coated
micro-biochips and accumulation of GRB2 in EGFRmicrodomains was observed by total internal reflection
fluorescence microscopy. Figure 5 reveals that EGF
(17 nM, 15 min)-induced tethering of GRB2-YFP to
EGFR-CFP is prevented not only by pretreatment with
the EGFR-inhibitor AG1478 (10 µM, 4 h), but also by
the FASN-inhibitors C75 and G28UCM. Decrease of the
fluorescence contrast (c/c0) is already observed after 2

(Figures 7B–7D). However, concurrent knock-down of
both REDD1 and AMPKα1/2 does not yield stronger
reversal of growth inhibition (Figure 7D). These data
indicate that REDD1 and AMPK are interfering with the
very same pathway, namely mTORC1, which essentially
contributes to cell death. In contrast, carboplatin, a DNAcross linking chemotherapeutic drug with an unrelated
mechanism of action, induces growth arrest and apoptosis,
but does not elevate HIF-1α, REDD1 or pAMPKα, nor
does it impede phosphorylation of S6 downstream of
mTORC1 (Supplementary Figure 7).

PI3K-mTOR-inhibitors such as dactolisib/NVP-BEZ235,
but not to MAPK pathway-inhibitors like MEK1/2-blocker
selumetinib/AZD6244 (Figure 8A, 8B). Co-exposure to
moderately effective doses of NVP-BEZ235 (0.2 µM in
SKOV3 and 0.01 µM in A2780 and OVCAR-3) cannot
improve the anticancer effect of the FASN-blockers
(Figure 8A), whereas combination with AZD6244 (40 µM
in SKOV3, 0.25 µM in A2780 and 3 µM in OVCAR-3)
significantly increases the FASN-inhibitor sensitivity
(Figure 8B). Accordingly, the IC50 values of G28UCM and
C75 are significantly reduced in the presence of AZD6244,
but not of NVP-BEZ235 (Figure 8C). This indicates that
the mechanism of action of FASN-blockers is mediated
through PI3K-mTORC1 inactivation. However, the antiproliferative efficacy of FASN-inhibitors is impaired by
compensatory cross-induction of RAF-MEK-ERK.

Combining FASN-inhibitors with a MEK-inhibitor
augments growth inhibition in OC cells
Inactivation of PI3K-mTORC1 is accompanied
by compensatory stimulation of MAPK as evidenced by
elevated levels of pERK after 1 and 2 days of treatment
(Figure 6A, Supplementary Figure 5D). This FASNinhibitor-dependent loosening of PI3K-MAPK crossrepression [30] prompted us to determine the effect
of FASN-blockers combined with kinase inhibitors
on OC cell growth. A large proportion of OC reveals
hyper-activation of the PI3K-mTORC1 pathway [6].
Consequently, these cells are highly sensitive to dual

DISCUSSION
Inhibition of FASN leads to FA depletion and
accumulation of malonyl-CoA. The relative contribution
of both events to FASN-inhibitor toxicity has been
discussed [22, 31] and obviously depends on the type
of inhibitor (Figure 1A–1C). Inhibitor-induced shortage
of required reaction product can be uncoupled from

inhibitor-induced buildup of toxic levels of substrate
by blocking the upstream lipogenic enzyme acetyl-CoA
carboxylase. This enzyme provides FASN with malonylCoA. Therefore, Acetyl-CoA carboxylase-inhibitors
such as TOFA cause FA depletion in the absence of high
levels of malonyl-CoA [31]. Interestingly, TOFA reveals
only low/moderate cytotoxicity in ovarian cancer cells
(Figure 1D) suggesting that ,besides FA depletion, malonylCoA elevation essentially contributes to the cytotoxicity of
FASN-inhibitors. Nevertheless, supplementation of OA has
been found to significantly alleviate growth inhibition by
FASN-blockers and partially restores cancer cell survival,
whereas supply of the primary enzyme product PA is rather
toxic (Figure 1B, 1C). This indicates that availability of
OA is crucial for sustained OC cell growth and that OC
cells are not able to process exogenous PA properly. In
addition, we observed that FASN-blockers alter the level
of DAG and PI in an opposing biphasic manner. Early
depletion of DAG concurs with a rise in PI followed by
accumulation of DAG and reduction of PI. Eventually, the
cells turn into a state of severe deficiency of both DAG
and PI (cf. Figures 2 with 3A, 3B). This suggests that

the drug-induced shortage of membrane phospholipids
is initially balanced by intense conversion of DAG into
PI. Eventually, however, the cells cannot prevent the
lipid content to fall below a crucial threshold (see also
Supplementary Figure S4). This stage is characterized
by an ‘unsaturated’ membrane lipid phenotype, which is
reflected by low MUFA-/high PUFA-content in PI and its
phosphorylated derivatives. Previous studies have shown
that cancer cell membranes in general tend to have a higher
degree of saturation, thus rendering them more resistant to
oxidative stress [32]. Hence, our study demonstrates that
FASN-inhibition restores a membrane lipid phenotype that
is reminiscent of non-malignant cells characterized by a
low amount of saturated lipids.
FASN lies at the crossroads between catabolic and
anabolic pathways. It controls homeostasis, energy balance
and cell growth, and interacts with oncogenic signaling
[22]. We recently observed that FASN-inhibition impairs
ERBB-PI3K-mTORC1 signaling in OC [14, 15]. Yet, the
underlying mechanism(s) remain elusive. Here we describe
a number of events that lead to prompt inactivation of
ERBB-PI3K-mTORC1 upon blockade of FA synthesis.

In particular, FASN-inhibition causes down-regulation of
membrane phospholipids. It reduces the level of EGFR
(ERBB)-receptor expression [14] and inhibits binding of
GRB2 to EGFR (Figure 5B). This results in a decrease of
signal activity upstream of PI3K. PIP2 is known to give rise
to two signaling lipids: 1. DAG, which stimulates RAF and
PI3K and 2. PIP3 generated by PI3K. These two lipids are
located upstream and downstream of PI3K, respectively.
We observed that FASN-inhibitory drugs down-regulate
DAG corroborating previous data [20]. Moreover, we
show for the first time that FASN-inhibitors lead to a
significant deficit in PIP3 leading to inactivation of AKT-

mTORC1, which provides yet another cogent explanation
for the observed FASN-inhibitor-dependent PI3K pathway
suppression. Accordingly, mTORC1 downstream target
ribosomal protein S6 becomes dephosphorylated. In
addition, we observed that FASN-blockers activate cell
stress proteins such as HIF-1α and REDD1, which are
known to repress mTORC1. A similar REDD1 involvement
has recently been observed when cells are exposed to
the anti-lipogenic compound orlistat [32]. In our setup,
up-regulation of REDD1 is transient and is followed by
elevated pAMPK, another negative regulator of mTORC1,
which gets activated when bioenergy is short. Quiescence

of PI3K-mTORC1 was found to precede FASN-inhibitorinduced cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP, two markers
of apoptosis. Accordingly, knockdown of either REDD1
or AMPK renders phosphorylation/activity of mTOR
(pmTOR) resistant to FASN-blockers and relieves druginduced growth inhibition (Figure 7B–7D). Attenuation
of ERBB-PI3K-mTORC1 activity upon FASN blockade
has been seen in all OC cell lines (SKOV3, A2780,
OVCAR-3) independent of the mode of FASN inhibition
(G28UCM, C75, FASN siRNAs) and independent of
the presence or absence of ERBB-stimulating growth
factors such as EGF and heregulin (HRG)-β1 (Figure
6 and Supplementary Figures 5 and 6). In contrast, the
standard cytotoxic drug carboplatin induces apoptosis
without elevating HIF-1α, REDD1 or pAMPKα, and it
does not diminish phosphorylation of S6 protein. This
indicates that down-regulation of mTORC1-S6 activity
is specifically required for apoptosis induction by FASNinhibitors but not by other drugs such as carboplatin.
Combination of G28UCM or C75 with the dual PI3K/

mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 (Figure 8) or with statins
(not shown), which inactivate mTORC1 as well [33], fails
to strengthen the G28UCM- or C75-mediated anticancer
response in SKOV3, A2780 or OVCAR-3 cells. This
indicates FASN-inhibitor-mediated mTORC1 silencing is
already maximal and additional blockade with yet another
PI3K/mTOR inhibitor is not productive anymore. Recent
evidence suggests that mTORC1-S6 activity may convert
a reversible cell cycle arrest into an irreversible one, which
typically occurs during cell senescence (geroconversion).
Thus, in addition to its usual function as oncogenic driver,
mTORC1-S6 may also act as inducer of cell aging when
the cycle machinery has been halted by other means
[34–36]. Phosphorylation of the MAPK ERK is increased
when pAKT levels drop. Most likely, this is due to release
of PI3K-AKT cross-inhibition of RAF-MEK-ERK.
Accordingly, concurrent blockade of the MEK-ERK axis
by MEK1/2 inhibitors such as AZD6244 or by upstream
ErbB inhibitors [14] increase the sensitivity against
FASN-blockers. Thus FASN-blocker-mediated decrease

Subsequently, REDD1 and pAKT become decreased, whereas pAMPKα gets increased. Levels of pERK peak at 24–48 h. Cleavage products

of PI3K-mTORC1 signaling results in untightening of
cross-inhibition of MAPK thereby enabling compensatory
MAPK activation, which lowers the anticancer effect of
FASN-blocking agents. Further clinical development and
evaluation of combinations of FASN-targeting drugs with
MAPK pathway inhibitors are therefore warranted.

IN), HIF-1α inhibitor LW6 (Calbiochem), FASN-inhibitors
C75 (racemic mixture of (−)- and (+)-enantiomers, Sigma),
(−)-C75 (F.G. Hegardt, D. Serra, Barcelona, Spain) [39],
G28UCM (R. Colomer, M.L. López Rodríguez, Madrid,
Spain) [40, 41] and TOFA (Calbiochem) were dissolved in
DMSO, whereas carboplatin (Selleckchem, Houston, TX)
was dissolved in sterile water. Stocks were diluted 1:500 or
1:1 000 in media.

Mass spectra were recorded using an AXIMACFRplus (Shimadzu, Manchester, UK) curved-field
reflectron TOF mass spectrometer equipped with a
337-nm pulsed nitrogen laser in the negative mode
using 9-aminoacridine as matrix [44]. Ion acceleration
voltage was 20 kV and the reflectron analyzer was at
25 kV. For structural identification of lipid molecules
a hybrid quadrupole iontrap (QIT)-TOF tandem-mass
spectrometer (MS/MS; AXIMA-Resonance, Shimadzu)
was used. Acquisition was in the low-mass range (m/z
300–1 000) and high-resolution (R = 1 000) ion selection
modes for MS/MS experiments of monoisotopically
selected precursor ions using low-energy collision
induced dissociation with argon as the collision gas.
Each spectrum shown represents the accumulation of
300–500 single laser shots. An external calibration based
on the exact mass values of the [M-H]- ions of defined
lipid standards was applied. The structural identity of
the different lipid species detected in the samples was
confirmed by MALDI-MS/MS spectra of authentic
reference compounds (Supplementary Figure 9). Data
processing was performed by Launchpad 2.9.3 software
(Shimadzu) using the Savitzky-Golay smoothing
algorithm.

Malonyl-CoA assay
SKOV3 cells (2 × 104/cm²) exposed for 0–72 h to
40 µM C75 or G28UCM were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer
(20 mM MOPS, pH 7.0; 2 mM EGTA; 5 mM EDTA; 1%
Triton X-100), sonicated (4 strokes at median amplitude,
10 sec each, 4°C) and centrifuged (1 500 × g, 15 min,
4°C). The supernatants containing 1.3 mg protein were
subjected to the Malonyl CoA BioAssay ELISA following
manufacturer’s instructions (United States Biological,
Salem, MA).

Cell proliferation
Cells (500–3 000/well, 96-well plate) attached
overnight before media containing 5% FCS ± drugs were
added. Cell numbers were determined using a formazan
dye assay (Biomedica, Vienna, Austria) as described [42].

PIP3 mass ELISA

Apoptosis assay

PIP3, unlike PIP and PIP2, was not amenable to MS
analysis–probably due to the high negative charge of PIP3
causing co-segregation with the protein fraction. This lipid
had therefore to be analyzed with a different technology.
SKOV3 and OVCAR-3 cells plated at 2.5 × 106 and
5 × 106, respectively, in 150 mm dishes were grown in
α-MEM containing 5% FCS and treated for 24 h with
the indicated concentrations of the FASN-inhibitors. For
detection of PI3K activity the cellular amount of its reaction
product PIP3 was directly quantitated using a competitive
PIP3 mass ELISA system following the manufacturer’s
protocol (Echelon, Salt Lake City, UT). Thereby PIP3
extracted from 107 cells is first incubated with a PIP3detector protein. The PIP3/PIP3-detector protein-complex
is then added to a PIP3-coated microplate for competitive
binding. A peroxidase-linked secondary reagent and a
colorimetric substrate are used to visualize the PIP3detector protein bound to the plate. The colorimetric signal
is inversely proportional to the amount of PIP3 extracted
from the cells.

SKOV3 cells (2 × 104/cm²) attached overnight
before media containing 5% FCS ± drugs were added.
At the end of treatment, cells were trypsinized and
counted. Ten thousand cells per sample were lysed in
proprietary lysis buffer and further processed for detection
of apoptosis using the Cell Death Detection ELISAplus
system from Roche Diagnostics GmbH (Vienna, Austria)
following the manufacturer’s protocol.

Lipid extraction and thin-layer chromatography
A modified two-step organic solvent extraction
protocol [43] was used to enrich PIs and PIPs. Briefly,
cold CHCl3 :MeOH (50:50 [v/v]) added to the washed
cell pellet, vortexed and centrifuged (2 000 × g, 5 min)
yielded a supernatant designated ‘Extract 1’. The cell
pellet was extracted again with CHCl3 : MeOH (70:30
[v/v], containing 0.3% aqueous HCl), sonicated (15–30
sec) and vortexed (5 min). 1N HCl was added, vortexed
(1–2 min) and centrifuged (12 000 × g, 5 min). The lower
organic phase represents ‘Extract 2’. This procedure
leads to efficient separation of > 85% PI in ‘Extract 1’
and > 95% PIP and PIP2 in ‘Extract 2’ (Supplementary
Figure 8). For thin-layer chromatography, aliquots of
both extracts were pooled and the lipids were separated
as described [16].
