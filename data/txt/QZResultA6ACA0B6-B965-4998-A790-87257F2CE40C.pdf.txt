SUMMARY

Author Manuscript

Retinoblastoma is an aggressive childhood cancer of the developing retina that is initiated by the
biallelic loss of the RB1 gene. To identify the mutations that cooperate with RB1 loss, we
performed whole-genome sequencing of retinoblastomas. The overall mutational rate was very
low; RB1 was the only known cancer gene mutated. We then evaluated RB1’s role in genome
stability and considered nongenetic mechanisms of cancer pathway deregulation. Here we show
that the retinoblastoma genome is stable, but multiple cancer pathways can be epigenetically
deregulated. For example, the proto-oncogene SYK is upregulated in retinoblastoma and is
required for tumor cell survival. Targeting SYK with a small-molecule inhibitor induced
retinoblastoma tumor cell death in vitro and in vivo. Thus, RB1 inactivation may allow
preneoplastic cells to acquire multiple hallmarks of cancer through epigenetic mechanisms,
resulting directly or indirectly from RB1 loss. These data provide novel targets for
chemotherapeutic interventions of retinoblastoma.

Author Manuscript

Retinoblastoma is a rare childhood cancer of the retina that can develop in a sporadic or a
heritable form and is fatal if untreated. When the RB1 gene was cloned, it was found to
undergo biallelic inactivation in virtually all retinoblastoma tumors1. Since then, hundreds
of genetic lesions have been identified in human cancer. These genetic lesions can be
grouped based on the signaling pathways they affect that have direct or indirect mechanistic
links to many of the common cellular properties or “hallmarks” of cancer. Thus, the rate of
cancer progression is related to the kinetics of acquisition of multiple genetic lesions and/or
epigenetic changes that ultimately lead to activation of growth-signaling pathways, evasion
of cell death and senescence, acquisition of limitless replicative potential, sustained
angiogenesis, and local tissue invasion and metastasis2.
RB1 inactivation confers limitless replicative potential to retinoblasts and it is rate limiting
for retinoblastoma tumorigenesis3. However, the mechanisms that enable retinoblastoma

cells to acquire the additional hallmarks of cancer remain unknown. Evidence from
molecular, cellular, and cytogenetic studies suggest that the RB1 protein is required for
maintaining chromosomal stability4,5, and its loss leads to chromosome instability (CIN) in
cells maintained in culture. These data raise the possibility that RB1 inactivation may
underlie the rapid acquisition of cooperating mutations in key cancer pathways through CIN.
Alternatively, epigenetic changes may play a more dominant role in cooperating with the
loss of RB1 retinoblastoma tumorigenesis. RB1 has been implicated in regulating most
major epigenetic processes, including miRNA regulation, DNA methylation, histone
modification, and ATP-dependent chromatin reorganization6–10. Thus, inactivation of RB1
in retinoblasts may lead to the rapid epigenetic deregulation of cancer genes that contribute
to the essential cellular properties of retinoblastoma.

Author Manuscript

In this study, we characterized the genetic and epigenetic landscapes of retinoblastoma and
explore the role of RB1 in regulating genomic stability. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS)
of 4 retinoblastomas and their paired germline DNA samples showed no genetic lesions in
known tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes, other than RB1. More importantly, an
orthotopic xenograft derived from 1 of the primary tumors showed no evidence of clonal
variation or new coding-region mutations. This finding suggests that retinoblastoma’s
genome is more stable than previously believed.

Author Manuscript

Unlike the genetic landscape of retinoblastoma, the epigenetic profile shows profound
changes compared to that observed in normal retinoblasts. One of the most striking results
was the induction of the expression of the proto-oncogene SPLEEN TYROSINE KINASE
(SYK) in human retinoblastoma. SYK is required for tumor cell survival, and inhibition of
SYK with a small-molecule inhibitor caused the degradation of MCL1 and caspasemediated cell death in retinoblastoma cells in culture and in vivo. These findings highlight
how comprehensive genetic and epigenetic analyses of tumors can be integrated and lead to
the discovery of promising new therapeutic approaches and shed light on the mechanisms
underlying the rapid progression of retinoblastoma following RB1 inactivation.

Retinoblastoma Whole-Genome Sequencing

Author Manuscript

We performed WGS analysis on 4 primary human retinoblastoma samples (Section S1 and
Table S1) and from matched normal tissue. Local tumor cell invasion but not metastasis was
evident in each patient (Fig. 1a–c and Fig. S1). We generated an orthotopic xenograft,
SJRB001X, of the primary tumor SJRB001 by inoculating primary tumor cells into the
vitreous of the eyes of immunocompromised mice (Section S2). SJRB001X exhibited
molecular, genetic and histopathologic features similar to SJRB001 (Fig. 1d–f, Figs. S2–4,
Tables S2–4 and Section S3).
Using a paired-end sequencing approach, we generated 1,040.9 Gb of sequence data for the
samples described; 956.8 Gb (92%) were successfully mapped to the NCBI 36.1 reference
genome (Section S4, Table S5). The average genome coverage was 28.9×, and the average
exon coverage was 23.8× with 98.4% of SNPs detected across all 9 genomes showing
concordance with their corresponding SNP array genotype calls at the same genomic

positions (Table S5). To provide additional sequence coverage, we performed transcriptome
sequencing of SJRB001-4 (Section S5, Table S6).

Author Manuscript

We identified 668 validated somatic sequence mutations and 40 structural variations (SVs)
across the 4 cases (Table 1). These included 23 tier-1 mutations in genes, 35 tier-2 mutations
in evolutionarily conserved regions of the genome (Section S6), 309 tier-3 mutations in
nonrepetitive regions of the genome that are not part of tiers 1 and 2; and 301 tier-4
mutations in repetitive sequences in the genome (Table 1 and Table S7). The average
number of sequence mutations was 167 per case (range, 56–258), with only 3.25 mutations
per case (range, 0–5) resulting in amino acid changes (Table 1). The estimated mean
mutation rate was 6.7×10−7 per base (range 1.03×10−7–2.17×10−8), which is 15-fold less
than that in adult tumors analyzed by WGS, except for AML11. The predominant changes
were C>A and G>T transversions (Fig. S5), which is consistent with the possibility that
some of the transversions result from production of 8-Oxoguanine during oxidative stress.
SJRB002 had no somatic sequence variations that resulted in amino acid changes; the only
SVs were the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the RB1 locus and a gain of chromosome 6p.
This suggests that very few genetic lesions are required for retinoblastoma progression after
RB1 inactivation.

RB1 gene inactivation in retinoblastoma

Author Manuscript

Both RB1 alleles were inactivated in each sample (Figs. S6, S7). SJRB002 and SJRB003 had
mutations in RB1 combined with copy number–neutral LOH, and SJRB001 and SJRB004
had somatic sequence mutations combined with RB1-promoter hypermethylation (Figs. S6–
8). Deep-sequence analysis of the germline sample from SJRB002 revealed that about 10%
of reads contained the R445 nonsense mutation, suggesting the presence of germline
chimerism for the RB1 mutation (Fig. S6). Combining the WGS data with SNP array data of
an additional 42 samples, we found that tumors from patients with lower regional nucleotide
diversity were much less likely to undergo LOH at the RB1 locus (Tables S8, S9, Section
S7). These data show for the first time a significant association (p=8×10−8, Fisher’s exact
test) between a germline genetic variation and mechanism of biallelic RB1 inactivation in
retinoblastoma.

Recurrent lesions in retinoblastoma

Author Manuscript

To determine whether any of the 11 genes with somatic mutations that caused amino acid
changes or a frameshift in the coding region (Table 1, Fig. 2a,b, Figs. S9, S10, Section S8,
Table S10), were recurrently mutated in retinoblastoma, we sequenced all exons from the 11
genes in our recurrent screening cohort of 42 retinoblastomas (Section S4). Only BCOR was
recurrently mutated in of retinoblastoma (6/46, 13%). Five of the samples had BCOR
mutations that resulted in premature truncation of the encoded protein, and 1 sample had a
focal gene deletion (Fig. 2c, Table S11, Fig. S11).
We also used the WGS data to identify somatic SVs including whole-chromosome gains and
losses, focal deletions (DEL), insertions (INS), inversions (INV), intrachromosomal
rearrangements (ITX), interchromosomal rearrangements (CTX), and regions of LOH (Fig.
2a–c, Section S9, Table S12, Fig. S12). The average number of SVs was 10 per case (range,
Nature. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 July 19.

0–24) (Table 1). SJRB001 had 4 SVs (2 DEL and 2 INS) including a gain of a region of
chromosome 2 spanning MYCN (Table S12) and the only chromosomal lesion in SJRB002
was a gain of 6p, which occurs in about 40% of human retinoblastomas12 (Fig. 2b). Only a
few genomic regions were affected by the SVs in SJRB003 and SJRB004 (Figs. S10, S13,
S14, Table S12).

Orthotopic retinoblastoma xenograft

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The genomic landscape of the orthotopic xenograft was remarkably similar to that of the
primary tumor, despite continuous growth and multiple passages in vivo over 9 months (Fig.
2, Table 1). All of the single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and SVs detected in SJRB001 were
retained in SJRB001X. Only 67 new SNVs and 4 SVs were identified in the xenograft, and
none targeted annotated genes (Fig. 2, Table 1). Moreover, each mutation was identified at a
subclonal level (range, 20%–30%) and the mutant allele frequency for the Tier1-4 lesions in
SJRB001 was retained in SJRB001X (Supplementary Fig. 15). This result was surprising
because several studies in mice and cell cultures have linked RB1 inactivation to defects in
chromosome segregation that result in aneuploidy 4,5,13–15 and CIN4. We measured the
distance between sister chromatids, between kinetochores, and the proportion of lagging
chromatids in 2 RB1-deficient human retinoblastoma orthotopic xenografts (SJRB001X and
SJRB002X)16. Consistent with results from RB1-deficient RPE cells4, the distances between
sister chromatids and kinetochores were increased, and there was evidence of lagging
chromosomes (Figs. S16, S17). However, less variation in ploidy was observed during
spectral karyotype (SKY) analysis of SJRB001X and SJRB002X that was more consistent
with the ploidy of wild-type cells (Fig. 3a,b, Table S13). Moreover, CNVs were much lower
in our cohort of 46 retinoblastomas than in tumors with known genome instability such as
ovarian cancer (Fig. 3c). Together, the cytogenetic data and WGS data suggest that the
genome is stable and newly acquired lesions do not provide a selective growth advantage
and are thus likely passenger mutations.

Identifying deregulated cancer pathways

Author Manuscript

There are many examples over the past several decades of epigenomic changes such as
DNA methylation contributing to tumorigenesis17–19. Indeed, a recent study demonstrated
changes in DNA methylation in Wilm’s tumors20 which, tend to have stable genomes like
retinoblastomas. To explore whether epigenetic deregulation of genes or pathways promotes
tumorigenesis in retinoblastoma, we carried out an integrative analysis of chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data, DNA-methylation data and gene expression data using
order statistics. The SJRB001X sample was used for ChIP assay (Figs. S18–20), and
primary tumor and xenograft samples were used for both DNA-methylation and gene
expression assays. In all three analyses, experimental results in RB tumors were compared to
those from human fetal retinae. A total of 104 genes, including 15 known cancer genes (Fig.
4a and Tables S14, S15), were found to have significant difference between RB tumors and
human fetal retina, indicating that several key cancer genes were epigenetically deregulated.

SYK is a novel therapeutic target
SYK is the 5th most significant gene identified by the integrative analysis and the only upregulated kinase gene (Table S15 and Fig. 4a). SYK is expressed throughout the
hematopoietic system, regulates immunomodulatory signaling, and has been implicated in
several hematologic malignancies21–24. Small-molecule inhibitors of SYK have been
developed to treat autoimmune disorders25, and 2 of those agents, BAY61-3606 and R406,
have shown efficacy in preclinical leukemia studies26–28.

Author Manuscript

ChIP-on-chip analysis showed increased activating histone modifications (H3K4me3 and
K3K9/14Ac) at SYK’s promoter, and the repressive histone marker (H3k9me3) was
unchanged. RNA polymerase II binding to the SYK promoter was also increased (Fig. 4b,
Tables S14, S15). These ChIP-on-chip results were validated in independent samples by
real-time RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 4c), and we confirmed the increase in SYK gene expression
(Fig. 4d). SYK protein levels were higher in human retinoblastoma orthotopic xenografts
and cell lines than in human fetal retinae (Fig. 4e). To determine whether SYK is expressed
in primary human retinoblastomas, we performed immunohistochemistry on a
retinoblastoma tissue microarray (TMA) or whole eye sections. In total, 100% (82/82)
showed very strong expression (3+) of SYK in all tumor cells; SYK was not expressed in
normal retina (Fig. 4f). SYK’s kinase activity is regulated through autophosphorylation at
the Tyr525/526 residues within its catalytic domain. These sites were phosphorylated in
retinoblastoma cells, and this phosphorylation was reversed by BAY 61-3606 or R406
exposure (Fig. 4g and data not shown).

Author Manuscript

To determine whether SYK expression is required for retinoblastoma growth, survival, or
both, we generated an shRNA to SYK and cloned it into the lentiviral vector Lenti-SYK-9.
Lenti-SYK-9 efficiently knocked-down SYK in retinoblastoma cell lines (Fig. S21) and
dramatically increased apoptosis in retinoblastoma cells (Fig. 4h, Fig. S21). Similar results
were obtained in vivo using SJRB001X (data not shown). We used an empty lentiviral
vector and a lentiviral vector encoding an SYK shRNA that less effectively reduced SYK
expression (Lenti-SYK-6) as controls. Cell lines that do not express SYK (BJ, 293T, and
uninduced Jurkat cells) were used as controls and the Lenti-SYK-9 lentivirus had no effect
on the growth or apoptosis of the control cells.

Author Manuscript

We exposed retinoblastoma cell lines that express high levels of SYK (Weri1 and RB355) to
various concentrations of the SYK inhibitors BAY 61-3606 or R406 for 72 hours and then
measured cell viability. Jurkat (uninduced) and 293T cells were used as negative controls.
Weri1 and RB355 cells were sensitive to both SYK inhibitors, but the Jurkat and 293T cells
were unaffected (Fig. 5a). Transmission electron microscopy of retinoblastoma cells treated
with the SYK inhibitors showed morphologic features consistent with cell death and
mitochondrial defects (Fig. S22); this was confirmed by scoring the proportion of activated
caspase-3+ cells (Fig. 5b, c, Fig. S22). Jurkat cells showed no increase in activated
caspase-3+ cells after treatment with 10 µM R406 or BAY 61-3606 (data not shown).
The proportions of cells from each line that incorporated EdU were similar, suggesting that
retinoblastoma’s cell cycle is not affected by SYK inhibition (Fig. 5d, e, Fig. S22). The

effects of targeting SYK were partially rescued by the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPH
(Fig. S22). Less MitoTracker Red accumulated in retinoblastoma cells exposed to the SYK
inhibitors (Fig. S22), yet treatment of Jurkat cells with either inhibitor had no effect on
MitoTracker Red accumulation (data not shown). Inhibiting SYK in B-CLL cells reduced
their autophosphorylation of SYK and destabilized MCL126,29, the only antiapoptotic
member of the BCL-2 family that is upregulated in retinoblastoma (data not shown). Both
inhibitors reduced autophosphorylation of SYK on Y525/526 (Fig. 4g) and reduced MCL1
expression coincident with apoptosis (Fig. 5f).

Author Manuscript

We tested the efficacy of BAY61-3606 in vivo on our SJRB001X model30. The
chemotherapy regimen consisted of a single subconjunctival dose of BAY 61–3606 on Day
1 and daily doses of topotecan (TPT) on Days 1–5 until either 6 courses (21 days per course)
were administered, or the tumor progressed and surgical enucleation was required (Fig.
5g,h). BAY 61-3606+TPT significantly improved outcome (p=0.003) (Fig. 5i), and its
efficacy was correlated with an increase in activated caspase-3+ cells in the treated eyes
(Fig. 5j). Previous studies using this model have shown that TPT combined with
subconjunctival carboplatin had no effect on tumor response or outcome 30, so the
improvement seen here can be attributed to targeting SYK. MCL1 expression was also
reduced in the treated eyes, which is consistent with increased apoptosis and targeting SYK
in vivo (Fig. 5k). Together, these results suggest that SYK is a promising new target for
treating retinoblastoma.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

It has been suggested that biallelic loss of RB1 directly causes genomic instability, which in
turn contributes to the rapid development of overt retinoblastoma. Our data failed to support
this hypothesis. The mutational rate and number of SVs per case that we assessed were
among the lowest reported in human cancer. Moreover, the only non-silent mutation in
SJRB002 was in RB1, and no SVs were detected. The minimal increase in passenger
mutations in SJRB001X cells, despite prolonged passage, was also consistent with a
relatively stable genome. These results support those from previous studies showing that
retinoblastoma karyotypes are stable in vitro and in vivo31,32. Our data suggest that genomic
instability is neither a hallmark of retinoblastoma nor sufficient to explain how
retinoblastomas progress so rapidly.

Author Manuscript

We propose that epigenetic mechanisms contribute to retinoblastoma tumorigenesis. We
identified several known oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes with histone modifications
and altered DNA methylation that correlated with changes in gene expression. Our key
discovery was that SYK is important in retinoblastoma. Retinal progenitor cells and retinal
neurons express little to no SYK, and SYK has no known function in the developing visual
system. Moreover, no recurrent genetic lesions in SYK are associated with retinoblastoma to
suggest that this gene drives tumorigenesis. Only by integrating epigenetic and gene
expression analyses, did we identify SYK as an important oncogene in retinoblastoma. This
is important not only for expanding our understanding of the biology of retinoblastoma but
also for advancing immediate therapeutic options that were not previously considered such
as BAY 61-3606 or R406. This study highlights the value of integrating WGS analyses of

Background mutation rate was calculated based on the ratio of Tier 3 mutations to the number of Tier 3 bases covered at least 10x in tumor and germline for each pair.

Structural variations include focal amplifications and deletions, LOH, interchromosomal and intrachromosomal translocations.

7

Tier 4 mutations are in repetitive regions of the genome.

7

Tier 3 mutations are found in regions of the genome that are not evolutionarily conserved.

6

Tier 2 mutations are found in regions of the genome that are conserved between humans and mice.

All of the somatic mutations in SJRB001 D-G were identified in SJRB001X. This row highlights the new mutations acquired in the xenograft compared to the primary tumor.
