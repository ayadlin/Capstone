Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a devastating brain tumor with poor prognosis and low median survival
time. Standard treatment includes radiation and chemotherapy with the DNA alkylating agent temozolomide
(TMZ). However, a large percentage of tumors are resistant to the cytotoxic effects of the TMZ-induced DNA
lesion O6-methylguanine due to elevated expression of the repair protein O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) or a defect in the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway. Although a majority of the TMZ-induced
lesions (N7-methylguanine and N3-methyladenine) are base excision repair (BER) substrates, these DNA lesions
are also readily repaired. However, blocking BER can enhance response to TMZ and therefore the BER pathway
has emerged as an attractive target for reversing TMZ resistance. Our lab has recently reported that inhibition of
BER leads to the accumulation of repair intermediates that induce energy depletion–mediated cell death via
hyperactivation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. On the basis of our observation that TMZ-induced cell death
via BER inhibition is dependent on the availability of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADþ), we have
hypothesized that combined BER and NADþ biosynthesis inhibition will increase TMZ efficacy in glioblastoma
cell lines greater than BER inhibition alone. Importantly, we find that the combination of BER and NADþ
biosynthesis inhibition significantly sensitizes glioma cells with elevated expression of MGMT and those
deficient in MMR, two genotypes normally associated with TMZ resistance. Dual targeting of these two
interacting pathways (DNA repair and NADþ biosynthesis) may prove to be an effective treatment combination
for patients with resistant and recurrent GBM. Cancer Res; 71(6); 2308–17. 2011 AACR.

brain cancer with a dismal median survival time, a high level

ment with the monofunctional alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ), also referred to as Temodar (2). Despite the
current standard treatment regimen, including the addition
of concomitant and adjuvant TMZ, the average survival
expectancy is 14.6 months and the overall 5-year survival
rate for GBM is 9.8% (3, 4). TMZ generates a spectrum of
DNA lesions including O6-methylguanine, N3-methyladenine, and N7-methylguanine (5). The O6-methylguanine
lesion is responsible for most of the TMZ-associated toxicity
and is a substrate for direct repair by O6-methylguanineDNA methyltransferase (MGMT; ref. 6). In the absence of
MGMT repair, O6-methylguanine is suggested to initiate a
futile cycle of mismatch repair (MMR) or alternately to
trigger ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein kinase
activation through the action of several MMR proteins (7),
leading to apoptosis and cell death (8–10). Much of the
resistance to TMZ observed clinically is because of high
expression of MGMT (and subsequent repair of the lesion) or
loss of MMR (therefore preventing the initiation of apoptotic
signaling; refs. 11–13). Additionally, almost all patients
eventually recur with the disease and the large majority
of recurrent tumors are resistant to chemotherapy (14, 15).
There are currently few alternate treatment options for
patients with TMZ-resistant tumors and adjuvant chemotherapy options are an area of intense research (1).

Inhibition of NAD+ Biosynthesis and DNA Repair

The N7-methylguanine and N3-methyladenine adducts
make up the majority of the TMZ lesions and are base excision
repair (BER) substrates. However, these DNA adducts induce
little toxicity under current therapeutic strategies due to rapid
repair by BER (16, 17). Hence, small molecules targeting BER
have become an attractive option for enhancing TMZ toxicity
independent of the cytotoxicity related to the O6-methylguanine DNA lesion. Repair of the alkylation-induced DNA lesions
N3-methyladenine and N7-methylguanine proceeds primarily
through the short patch BER pathway (18). DNA polymerase-b
(Polb) has been shown to be the rate-limiting step in BER and
loss of Polb leads to increased sensitivity to the N3-methyladenine and N7-methylguanine lesions due to the accumulation of repair intermediates (16, 19, 20). Alternatively, blocking
the abasic site formed during the BER process with the
chemical inhibitor methoxyamine hydrochloride (MX; also
referred to as TRC102) has also been shown to enhance
alkylation sensitivity independently of the O6-methylguanine
lesion (21–23). Thus, strategic targeting of BER can enhance
TMZ efficacy regardless of MGMT or MMR status.
We have recently reported that cell death due to incomplete
BER (e.g., triggered by BER inhibition) is mediated through
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) hyperactivation and
subsequent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADþ) and
ATP depletion (20). The PARP1 (ARTD1) and PARP2 (ARTD2)
proteins (24) act as sensors of incomplete BER and become
hyperactivated, consuming NADþ as a substrate for poly(ADPribose) (PAR) synthesis (20). Consumption of NADþ after DNA
damage leads to ATP depletion, likely due to continued
resynthesis of NADþ as well as ongoing cellular utilization
of NADþ and ATP for metabolic functions (25, 26). Many
reports on DNA damage–induced PARP hyperactivation suggest that cell death occurs via PAR signaling and apoptosisinducing factor (AIF) translocation from the mitochondria to
the nucleus leading to nuclear fragmentation (27, 28). Interestingly, the caspase-independent cell death observed after
incomplete BER is independent of AIF translocation or PAR
catabolite signaling (20). Further, alkylation hypersensitivity
observed after incomplete BER can be rescued by supplementation with the NADþ precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), supporting our conclusion that cell death after
BER failure is an energy-dependent phenotype (20).
Therefore, we hypothesized that dual targeting of the NADþ
biosynthesis pathway and the BER pathway would greatly
enhance TMZ sensitivity regardless of MGMT or MMR status.
NADþ can be synthesized through the de novo pathway from Ltryptophan, but in most mammalian cells NADþ content is
maintained through the NADþ salvage pathways (29). Nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT) controls the
salvage-pathway rate-limiting step for the biosynthesis of
NADþ from nicotinamide (30). The small molecule inhibitor
FK866 is a specific inhibitor of NAMPT with activity in the low
nanomolar range that is highly effective in reducing cellular
NADþ levels (31). FK866 is currently in clinical trials (APO866;
Topotarget USA, Inc.) as a monotherapy for the treatment of
hematologic cancers (32) and is reported to increase cell
killing in combination with multiple cytotoxic agents (33).
We report herein that combining FK866 with BER inhibition

(using the small molecule BER inhibitor MX) potentiates TMZ
tumor cell killing and strongly sensitizes glioma cells derived
from chemotherapy-resistant tumors to TMZ.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and reagents
Alpha Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM) was from
MediaTech. Minimum Essential Medium (MEM), heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), L-glutamine, antibiotic/antimycotic, and geneticin were from InVitrogen. Gentamycin was
from Sigma. FK866 (NIMH #F-901; IUPAC name: (E)-[4-(1benzyoylpiperidin-4-yl)butly]-3-(pyridin-3-yl)acrylamide; CAS
number: 201034–75-5) was obtained from the National Institute of Mental Health Chemical Synthesis and Drug Supply
Program (Bethesda, MD). FK866 was dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) to prepare a stock solution at a concentration of 1 mmol/L and stored at 30C. Methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and methoxyamine hydrochloride (MX) were
from Sigma. TMZ (NSC #362856; IUPAC name: 3-methyl-2oxo-1,3,4,5,8-pentazabicyclo[4.3.0]nona-4,6,8-triene-7-carboxamide; CAS number: 856622–93-1) was obtained from the
National Cancer Institute Developmental Therapeutics Program (Bethesda, MD) and Sigma. TMZ was dissolved in DMSO
to a concentration of 100 mmol/L.
Cell culture
All cells were cultured at 5% CO2 and 37 C. LN428 glioblastoma cells (a generous gift from Dr. Ian Pollack, University
of Pittsburgh) and derived cell lines were cultured in alpha
EMEM supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS, L-glutamine, antibiotic/antimytotic, and gentamycin. LN428 is an
established glioblastoma-derived cell line with mutations in
p53, deletions in p14ARF, and p16, and is wild type for PTEN
(34, 35). The LN428/MPG cells (overexpressing methylpurine
DNA glycosylase; MPG) were supplemented with 6 mg/mL
G418. LN428/MPG cell lines with stable knockdown of PARP1,
PARP2, MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 were generated via lentiviral
transduction of shRNA as previously described (20) and
cultured in growth media with 6 mg/mL G418 and 1.0 mg/
mL puromycin. Knockdown of the target gene was assed by
reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR; see Supplementary Methods). The T98G glioblasoma cell line was purchased from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; obtained in 2004)
and cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% heat inactivated
FBS, nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, and antibiotic/antimytotic (36). Both cell lines were tested for crossspecies contamination and authenticated by RADIL cell check
services as of November 16, 2010. The genetic profiles provided by RADIL were checked against the ATCC STR loci
database to confirm the identity of the T98G cell line, and to
ensure that the LN428 genetic profile was unique from any
ATCC banked cell line.

with TMZ either alone or as a cotreatment with MX for 6 hours,
at which time the drug treatments were removed and replaced
with normal culture media. Cells were allowed to grow for an
additional 7 days and were assayed for cell survival as described
above. All doses were performed in triplicate.

NADþ measurements
Cells were seeded and cultured for 24 hours and then
treated for 24 hours with the indicated dose of FK866. NADþ
was measured, as reported previously, by the Enzychrom
NADþ/NADH assay kit (BioAssay Systems; ref. 20). Absorbance was determined by a Molecular Devices VersaMax
tuneable plate reader.

Statistical analysis
All data are shown as a mean  SE from 3 independent
experiments. Student's t test was used for comparisons
between 2 groups. For multiple comparisons, 1-way ANOVA
followed by post hoc test with Bonferroni correction was used.
Statistical analysis was done by GraphPad PRISM.

Quantitative PAR assay
Cells were seeded at 1.5  106 cells per 100-mm dish 24
hours prior to treatment. Cells were then treated with media
(control) or MMS for the indicated time. Cells were immediately lysed in modified Laemmli buffer containing 1% SDS in
the absence of bromophenol blue. Protein content was quantified by the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). PAR content was
quantified by a colorimetric PAR ELISA kit (Trevigen). Absorbance was determined by a Molecular Devices VersaMax
tuneable plate reader.
ATP measurements
Cells were seeded in black 96-well plates (Perkin Elmer) 24
hours prior to treatment. Cells were treated with drugs as
described earlier in the text. One-hour after alkylation treatment,
cells were washed and allowed to recover in normal media
(1 hour). Cells were lysed and ATP content measured by the ATPlite assay kit (Perkin Elmer). Luminescent readings were done by
a BioTek Synergy 2 Multi-Mode microplate reader.
Long-term cytotoxicity assay in modified LN428 cell
lines
For long-term survival assays with FK866 pretreatment,
cells were seeded at 80,000 cells/well in 6-well plates 24 hours
prior to treatment. Cells were treated with FK866 or media
control for 24 hours. Cells were then trypsinized and plated
into 60-mm dishes with or without FK866 and were allowed to
attach for 6 hours prior to replacing media with TMZ containing media. All doses were done in triplicate 60-mm dishes.
Cells were allowed to grow for 10 to 12 days in the presence of
TMZ. Cells were then trypsinized and counted by a CASY
automated cell counter. All experiments were done in triplicate. Long-term survival experiments combining FK866 with
MX pretreatment were done as earlier in the text, but after the
6-hour attachment, cells were treated for 30 minutes with 10
mmol/L MX that was diluted to 5 mmol/L on addition of TMZ.
Cells were allowed to grow for 10 to 12 days in the presence of

Results
MPG and PARP1 expression modulate BER-dependent
PAR generation and cell death after alkylation exposure
We have hypothesized that varying the expression of the
initiating BER enzyme MPG will initiate an imbalance in the
BER pathway, resulting in the accumulation of BER intermediates (e.g., 50 dRP) after alkylation base damage (19),
leading to an increase in TMZ-induced PARP activation
and cell death (20). To test this hypothesis, we have stably
overexpressed MPG in the glioma cell line LN428 (noted as
LN428/MPG). The parental LN428 cell line contains undetectable levels of MPG (Supplementary Fig. S1). This allows for a
model system in which events related to incomplete BER can
be dissected from other alkylation damage events such as
effects on translation (37). In addition, by utilizing relatively
low doses of alkylating agent that produce an effect only in the
LN428/MPG cell line we can eliminate effects from other
alkylation events such as the formation of DNA double-strand
breaks or protein alkylation (38). For example, LN428/MPG
cells are hypersensitive to the alkylating agent MMS at doses
as low as 0.5 mmol/L, whereas there is little or no cytotoxicity
observed for the parental LN428 cell line at doses as high as 1.5
mmol/L (Fig. 1A). Further, utilizing a quantitative ELISA
method, we find that PAR generation is 10-fold higher in
LN428/MPG cells than in LN428 cells at an MMS dose of 1.5
mmol/L (Fig. 1B), likely resulting from accumulation of BER
intermediates (20).
There are multiple PARP family members (24), of which
PARP1 (ARTD1) and PARP2 (ARTD2) have also been associated with the BER pathway (26, 39). To define the role of
either PARP1 or PARP2 as the enzyme responsible for the
increased generation of PAR after BER intermediate accumulation, stable PARP1 and PARP2 knockdown (KD) cell lines
were generated via lentiviral shRNA expression in the LN428/
MPG cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A). PARP1-KD provides
almost complete rescue of the MMS-induced cytotoxicity
and ATP depletion observed in the LN428/MPG/PARP1-KD
cells and reduces PAR levels as compared with the LN428/MPG
cell line after 15 minutes of alkylation exposure (Fig. 1C and D;
Supplementary Fig. S2B and C). Interestingly, PARP1-KD did

not completely eliminate PAR generation, most likely from
PARP2-mediated synthesis. Further, PARP1-KD had a significant effect on the kinetics of PAR catabolism, with the PAR
signal remaining at the same level after 30 minutes exposure
instead of the rapid poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase
(PARG)–mediated degradation observed in PARP1 proficient cells (Fig. 1D; Supplementary Fig. S2C). This leaves
open the question of whether PARP2 generated PAR has
different properties and consequences compared with PAR
chains generated by PARP1 and whether PARP1 expression
impacts PARG activity. Taken together, we suggest that the
energy depletion–mediated cell death observed after incomplete BER (BER inhibition) is largely PARP1 mediated with
only a small contribution by PARP2. Given our recent
understanding that tumor cell death after BER inhibition

www.aacrjournals.org

is an energy depletion–mediated process (20), we sought to
take advantage of this observation by targeting the intersecting pathways of BER and NADþ biosynthesis to enhance
cell death in chemotherapy-resistant tumor cells.
Inhibition of NADþ biosynthesis enhances alkylationinduced cell death after incomplete BER
Inhibition of NADþ biosynthesis (24 hours) with FK866
reduces cellular NADþ content to 25% of control levels in both
parental and LN428/MPG tumor cells (Fig. 2A). Consistent with
previous reports in other cell types, this 24-hour window of
NADþ biosynthesis inhibition is not toxic when evaluated by a
short-term (48-hour) cell survival assay (Fig. 2B), but exhibits
significant toxicity in both the LN428 and LN428/MPG cells
after 72 hours of continuous FK866 treatment independent of

in a BER-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). This effect was dependent on the dose of FK866 (Fig. 2C).
Inhibition of NADþ biosynthesis potentiates cell death
by alkylating agents after BER inhibition
To test our hypothesis that NADþ depletion would enhance
BER inhibition–mediated cell death, we utilized MX, a small
molecule BER inhibitor that can potentiate alkylation
damage–induced cell death (21–23) by covalently binding
to the aldehydic form of the DNA abasic site formed after
BER initiation (21). A 30 mmol/L dose of MX (30-minute
pretreatment) and cotreatment with MMS potentiates cell
death 10-fold, consistent with previous reports in colon and
ovarian carcinomas (Fig. 3B, solid circle; refs. 21, 23). This

potentiation is dependent on MPG expression, as the initiating
DNA glycosylase is required for abasic site formation after
alkylation damage, and so we observe no MX-mediated potentiation in the LN428 cells but robust MX-mediated potentiation
in the LN428/MPG cells (compare Fig. 3A and B). MX inhibition
of BER, in combination with FK866-mediated inhibition of
NADþ biosynthesis, results in an IC50 for MMS of 150 mmol/L, a
sensitizer enhancement ratio (SER) of 3.125. This also yields a
2-fold decrease in IC50 from either FK866 þ MMS cotreatment
or MX þ MMS cotreatment (Fig. 3B).
Both FK866 and MX enhance ATP depletion after
alkylation damage
To further investigate the enhanced cell death observed
when MX and FK866 are combined with alkylating agents,
cellular ATP levels were measured after combination treatment. As expected (20), alkylation damage resulted in a
decrease in the level of cellular ATP when measured 2 hours
after MMS treatment of the LN428/MPG cells (Fig. 4A and B,

solid bars). Further, FK866 pretreatment prior to alkylation
(MMS) damage resulted in lower levels of ATP 2 hours after
MMS treatment compared with alkylation damage alone
(Fig. 4A, dotted bars). However, 24 hours of NADþ depletion
alone had no significant effect on ATP levels (Fig. 4A; striped
bars). Surprisingly, treatment with MX þ MMS also induced
loss of ATP beyond that observed by alkylation (MMS) damage
alone (Fig. 4B, dotted bars). It is important to note that this
enhanced ATP loss is only observed in the LN428/MPG cell
line, supporting the notion that ATP loss after alkylation
damage is dependent on the expression of MPG and PARP
hyperactivation (an event not seen in the LN428 cell line;
Fig. 1B). This suggests that both inhibitors (FK866 and MX)
enhance cell death when combined with alkylation by enhancing ATP loss in a BER and PARP-dependent manner.
Dual inhibition of BER and NADþ biosynthesis
sensitizes chemotherapy-resistant glioma cells to TMZ
Given the strong potentiation of cell death when combining
TMZ with inhibitors of BER and NADþ biosynthesis in a 48hour cytotoxicity assay, we investigated whether this 3-drug
combination could sensitize glioma cells harboring established TMZ-resistant genotypes. TMZ resistance can result
from either overexpression of MGMT or loss of MMR (11–13).
LN428 and LN428/MPG cells are both MMR-positive and
express low levels of MGMT. In a long-term survival assay
(allowing multiple rounds of replication required for O6methylguanine–mediated cell death), LN428 cells are highly
sensitive to TMZ (IC50  15 mmol/L; Supplementary Fig. S4A).
To convert these cells to a TMZ-resistant phenotype, MGMT
was stably overexpressed in the LN428/MPG cell line, resulting
in resistance of the LN428/MPG/MGMT cell line to TMZ in a
long-term survival assay (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Fig. 4A). MX,
in combination with TMZ, sensitizes MPG-positive cells with
an IC50 of 160 mmol/L TMZ (Supplementary Table S1). Similarly, FK866 pretreatment plus TMZ sensitizes LN428/MPG/
MGMT cells with an IC50 of 175 mmol/L TMZ (Supplementary
Table S1). However, combining FK866 pretreatment with MX
and TMZ results in an IC50 of 17 mmol/L, approximately a 10fold decrease in IC50, and an SER value of 15.88 (Fig. 5A;
Supplementary Fig. 5A; Supplementary Table S1). Knockdown
of the MMR proteins MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 (Supplementary Fig. S4B) also renders LN428/MPG cells resistant to TMZ
(Fig. 5B–D; Supplementary Fig. S5B–D). However, the dual
inhibition of BER and NADþ biosynthesis can overcome the
TMZ resistance that results from MMR deficiency, yielding an
increase in the cytotoxic response to 75 mmol/L TMZ (Fig. 5B–
D; Supplementary Fig. 5B–D).
To further investigate the utility of this drug combination in
treating GBMs with endogenous or acquired resistance to
TMZ, we utilized T98G cells, a glioma cell line with endogenous overexpression of MGMT (36, 40). T98G cells have robust
expression of BER proteins as well as NAMPT (data not
shown) and have an approximate 2-fold increase in the basal
level of NADþ as compared with the LN428 and LN428/MPG
cells (Supplementary Fig. S6A), requiring cell line–specific
titering of FK866 dosing. Twenty-four–hour exposure to
FK866 with doses up to 80 nmol/L had minimal effect on

cell viability in a long-term cell survival assay (Supplementary
Fig. S6B). FK866 enhances TMZ toxicity in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 6A), whereas MX, in combination with TMZ,
yields an enhancement of TMZ toxicity (Fig. 6B). Most importantly, the combination of FK866 and MX, with TMZ, significantly enhanced cell death in an FK866 dose-dependent
manner beyond that of either combination alone (Fig. 6B). All
together, these results support our proposed strategy of dual
inhibition of the BER pathway and NADþ biosynthesis. We
suggest that such a strategy may be useful to overcome TMZ
resistance in primary or recurrent TMZ-resistant GBM and we
offer proof of principle data to validate future analysis in an in
vivo preclinical model.

Discussion
This study presents a novel strategy to elicit tumor cell
toxicity from the N3-methyladenine and N7-methylguanine
lesions induced by TMZ by targeting 2 interacting pathways:
the BER and NADþ biosynthesis pathways. The introduction

2314

of TMZ as a standard treatment for glioblastoma has resulted
in a significant increase in response rate and median survival
time over surgery and radiation therapy alone (4). However,
5-year survival rates still remain dismally low (3, 4), likely from
inherent TMZ resistance and/or relapse with chemotherapyresistant tumors (14). Most of this resistance to TMZ is
attributed to the loss of toxicity by the O6-methylguanine
lesion via elevated expression of MGMT or a defect in the
MMR pathway (12). However, more than 80% of the DNA
lesions produced by TMZ are BER substrates, suggesting BER
modulation is a promising therapeutic option (41). The explosion of clinical trials involving TMZ combined with PARP
inhibitors and ongoing clinical trials of TMZ combined with
MX highlights this point (42, 43).
We have previously observed that inhibition of BER (via
genetic modulation) combined with alkylation treatment
leads to necrotic cell death resulting from PARP hyperactivation with concomitant NADþ and ATP depletion (20). Given
this model, we sought to enhance TMZ response by inhibiting
both BER and NADþ biosynthesis. This novel, combinatorial,

24-hour pretreatment with varying doses of FK866 followed by a

and seems to be well tolerated (43). FK866 (also known as
APO866) is also currently in clinical trials as a monotherapy
and is well tolerated (32). The concern in combining BER
inhibition and NADþ biosynthesis inhibition is that the combination may critically lower energy levels and induce necrosis
in healthy tissue. The high energy requirements and rapid
NADþ turnover of tumor cells may allow for selectivity for the
FK866/MX/TMZ drug combination over normal tissue (47).
Further, it has been suggested that NADþ loss by PARP
hyperactivation is cytotoxic by creating a glycolytic block
(48, 49). Tumor selectivity may be realized from the reliance
of glioblastomas on glycolysis for energy, whereas normal
brain tissue exhibits higher levels of oxidative phosphorylation
(50). Interestingly, in one report, up to 50% of GBMs tested
were deficient in the NAPRT1-mediated NADþ biosynthesis
pathway responsible for generating NADþ from nicotinic acid
(NA) and in a separate report it was shown that NA supplementation can rescue the toxic effects of high-dose FK866 on
normal tissue (47, 51). This also suggests an opportunity for a
synthetic lethal approach by our novel 3-drug combination, in
which healthy tissue is supplemented with NA while selectively killing tumor cells unable to utilize the NAPRT1 arm of
the pathway.
Targeted NADþ biosynthesis inhibition combined with BER
inhibition plus TMZ gives a promising decrease in IC50 in
resistant glioblastoma tumor cells. TMZ is also currently in
clinical trials for use with malignant melanoma, another
chemotherapy-resistant tumor with few treatment options
(52). This drug combination may also prove to be useful in
increasing efficacy of TMZ in melanoma and potentially in
other tumor types that have shown little response to TMZ. For
example, we have reported that genetic inhibition of BER in
breast cancer cells shows similar sensitization, suggesting that
this drug combination would also be useful for the treatment
of triple-negative tumors (19). In conclusion, this study illustrates a novel therapeutic option for tumors resistant to the
TMZ-induced O6-methylguanine lesion, by utilizing clinically
available chemical inhibitors of the interacting pathways of
BER and NADþ biosynthesis.
Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest

3-drug strategy realized a reduction of TMZ IC50 greater than
10-fold in multiple models of TMZ-resistant tumor cells as
well as an endogenously resistant GBM cell line (T98G). The
induction of necrotic cell death as opposed to apoptotic cell
death is a promising feature of this novel treatment combination, because a percentage of GBMs are also known to be
resistant to apoptotic cell death (44), suggesting that this drug
combination may be preferable over alternate chemotherapy
options that induce apoptosis. Although necrosis is primarily
thought of as having a negative inflammatory impact on
surrounding tissue, release of high-mobility group box 1
and other receptor for advanced glycation endproducts
ligands after necrosis may aid in stimulation of the immune
system and clearance of the tumor, thus potentially increasing
the efficacy of this drug combination (45, 46).
MX, in combination with TMZ, is currently in phase I
clinical trials for the treatment of a variety of solid tumors
