BACKGROUND: Deletions of derivative chromosome 9 are a poor prognostic factor in patients with chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML) treated with hydroxyurea, interferon, or stem cell transplantation. Imatinib may overcome the
adverse prognostic impact of deletions of derivative chromosome 9. METHODS: A study was undertaken to investigate the prognostic impact of deletions of derivative chromosome 9 in 353 patients with CML receiving the second
generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) nilotinib (n ¼ 161) or dasatinib (n ¼ 192). RESULTS: Deletion of derivative
chromosome 9 status was determined in 245 (69%). Twenty-eight (11%) patients, 22 in chronic phase, 4 in accelerated
phase, and 2 in blast phase, carried deletions of derivative chromosome 9, including 17 receiving nilotinib and 11
receiving dasatinib (P ¼ .47). Overall survival (OS) at 24 months was similar between patients with or without deletions of derivative chromosome 9 (70% vs 71%, P ¼ .76). For patients in chronic phase, no significant differences in
overall major cytogenetic response (77% vs 82%, P ¼ .57) or complete cytogenetic response (77% vs 81%, P ¼ .71)
rates were observed between patients with or without deletions of derivative chromosome 9. At 24 months, patients
with CML in chronic phase without deletions of derivative chromosome 9 had improved event-free survival (EFS)
(88% vs 66%, P ¼ .07) and OS (96% vs 82%; P ¼ .08) compared with those carrying deletions of derivative chromosome 9. However, multivariate analysis established second-line versus frontline second generation TKI therapy as the
only adverse prognostic factor for EFS and increased bone marrow blast burden and older age as independent
adverse prognostic factors for OS. CONCLUSIONS: Deletions of derivative chromosome 9 do not appear to be an independent risk factor for survival among patients with CML in chronic phase receiving second generation TKIs. CanC 2011 American Cancer Society.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the BCR-ABL1 oncogene, the molecular byproduct of Philadel-

phia (Ph) chromosome.1 The balanced t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) translocation also produces a reciprocal ABL1-BCR fusion on
the derivative chromosome 9. ABL1-BCR is transcribed in approximately 70% of patients with CML, although its significance remains unknown.2,3 Submicroscopic deletions of derivative chromosome 9 mapping to regions adjacent to the
translocation breakpoints occur in 9% to 15% of patients, as assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques.4-9 These deletions are generally large, occur at the same time as the t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) rather than as a secondary
event, and have variable breakpoints, causing the loss of sequences from chromosome 9, chromosome 22, or both if they
encompass the junction of ABL1-BCR.4,7 Early reports suggested that patients carrying deletions of derivative chromosome 9 treated with hydroxyurea or interferon-a (IFNa)-based therapies progressed more rapidly to advanced phases of
the disease and had a shorter overall survival (OS) compared with patients without deletions of derivative chromosome
9.4,5,7,10,11 The prognostic impact of deletions of derivative chromosome 9 in patients receiving imatinib is less clear.
Whereas some studies have suggested that the prognosis of patients with CML in chronic phase carrying deletions of derivative chromosome 9 treated with imatinib, although improved compared with prior therapies, was still poorer than that of

more recent studies indicate that imatinib may overcome
the poor prognostic impact imparted by this cytogenetic
abnormality.6,9,12
The second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs) nilotinib and dasatinib have been approved for the
treatment of patients with CML resistant or intolerant to
imatinib.13,14 Given their activity in the postimatinib failure setting, ongoing trials are addressing their activity in
newly diagnosed patients with CML in chronic phase.15-17
The impact of deletions of derivative chromosome 9 in
patients receiving second generation TKIs is unknown. We
investigated the prognostic impact of deletions of derivative
chromosome 9 in 353 patients with CML treated at our
institution with nilotinib or dasatinib. In keeping with
what has been reported with imatinib therapy, patients
with CML in chronic phase carrying deletions of derivative
chromosome 9 do not appear to have a worse outcome
compared with their counterparts without deletions after
treatment with second generation TKIs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Group
A total of 353 consecutive patients with CML received
second generation TKIs in clinical trials at The University
of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center either after imatinib failure or as frontline therapy between November
2005 and June 2008. All trials were approved by the institutional review board. Informed consent was provided
according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Deletion of derivative chromosome 9 status was assessed by FISH in all
patients using the Vysis extrasignal probe (Vysis, Dowers
Grove, Ill). Two-hundred forty-five (69%) patients were
evaluable for the presence of deletions of derivative chromosome 9 and were included in this retrospective analysis.
Of them, 144 were in chronic phase (68 received nilotinib
[45 as frontline therapy], and 76 received dasatinib [48 as
frontline therapy]), 59 in accelerated phase, and 42 in
blast phase. Six patients had received an allogeneic stem
cell transplantation before therapy with nilotinib or dasatinib: 1 in second chronic phase, 3 in accelerated phase,
and 2 in blast phase. The definitions of chronic phase,
accelerated phase, blast phase, and imatinib failure were
adopted from previously published studies using nilotinib
or dasatinib.18,19 Briefly, imatinib resistance was defined
as a lack of complete hematologic response (CHR) after 3
months of imatinib treatment, a lack of any cytogenetic
response after 6 months of treatment, a lack of a major

5086

cytogenetic response (>35% Phþ cells) after 12 months
of treatment, an increasing white blood cell (WBC) count
on at least 2 consecutive occasions (with a doubling of the
count from the nadir to 20  109/L or an absolute
increase of 50  109/L), or a relapse after a CHR or
major cytogenetic response. Imatinib intolerance was
defined as at least grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity, or
grade 4 hematologic toxicity persisting for >7 days,
related to imatinib, regardless of the dose.
Evaluation During Treatment
Before second generation TKI therapy, patients were evaluated with history and physical exam, complete blood cell
count (CBC) with differential, and blood chemistry
including total bilirubin, creatinine, and alanine aminotransferase. All patients had a pretreatment bone marrow
evaluation for morphology, cytogenetic analysis, FISH,
and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cytogenetic analysis was performed by the G-banding technique
in 20 metaphases, and bone marrow specimens were
examined on direct or 24-hour cultures. During second
generation TKI therapy, CBC and blood chemistry were
monitored weekly during the first 1 to 3 months, then every 2 to 6 weeks. Bone marrow aspirations for morphology, cytogenetics (FISH when conventional cytogenetics
rendered insufficient metaphases), and PCR were
repeated every 3 to 4 months for the first year, and every 6
months thereafter. Patients were followed for survival at
least every 3 months. Toxicity was graded at each visit
according to the National Cancer Institute Common
Toxicity Criteria version 3.0.
Response Criteria
Response criteria were as previously described.6 Briefly, a
CHR was defined as a WBC count <10  109/L, platelet
count <450  109/L, no immature cells (blasts, promyelocytes, myelocytes) in the peripheral blood, and disappearance of all signs and symptoms related to leukemia
(including palpable splenomegaly) lasting for at least 4
weeks. Cytogenetic responses were classified as complete
(0% Phþ), partial (1%-35% Phþ), and minor (36%-90%
Phþ). Major cytogenetic response included complete
cytogenetic response plus partial cytogenetic response (ie,
Phþ 35%). For the purpose of this analysis, a major molecular response was defined as a BCR-ABL1/ABL1 transcript ratio 0.1% and a complete molecular response as
undetectable BCR-ABL1 transcripts (with sensitivity of at
least 4.5 logs). Event-free survival (EFS) was calculated
from the time treatment began until progression, loss of

response, or death from any cause or last follow-up. OS
was calculated from the time treatment began until death
from any cause, or last follow-up.

FISH
Bone marrow interphase nuclei were analyzed by FISH
using the locus-specific identifier BCR/ABL1 dual-color
extrasignal probe (Vysis) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. This probe has been designed to reduce the
false-positive rate by labeling both the ABL1 gene and the
argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) gene, which is located
centromeric to the ABL1 gene on 9q34. The ASS/ABL1
genes are labeled with spectrum orange. The BCR gene on
chromosome 22q11.2 is labeled with spectrum green. In
cases that contain BCR/ABL1 rearrangement without deletion of the ASS gene, hybridization to an interphase nucleus demonstrates 1 green signal (the native BCR gene), 1
large orange signal (the native ABL1 signal), 1 smaller orange signal (extrasignal) on the derivative chromosome 9,
and 1 yellow fusion signal on the derivative chromosome
22. In cases with deletion of the ASS gene on the derivative
chromosome 9, the smaller orange signal (extrasignal) is
lost.
Statistical Considerations
The patient characteristics (stage, nilotinib vs dasatinib,
clinical features at the start of second generation TKIs,
and presence of deletions of derivative chromosome 9)
were compared according to deletion of derivative chromosome 9 status by using Fisher exact test. Estimates of
survival curves were calculated according to the KaplanMeier product limit method and compared by means of
the log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the relationship between
patient characteristics and survival. Predictive variables
with P values of <.1 by univariate analysis were included
in a multivariate analysis. All reported P values are 2sided, and those <.05 were considered significant.

RESULTS
Characteristics of Patients According to
Deletion of Derivative Chromosome 9 Status
We evaluated 353 patients with CML treated with either
nilotinib (n ¼ 161) or dasatinib (n ¼ 192). Nilotinib or
dasatinib was initial therapy for early chronic phase CML
in 93 patients (nilotinib ¼ 45, dasatinib ¼ 48). Bone marrow specimens from 245 (69%) of 353 (133 on nilotinib
and 112 on dasatinib) were analyzed by FISH for the pres-

ence of deletion of derivative chromosome 9. Twentyeight (11%) patients carried deletions of derivative chromosome 9 and 217 an intact derivative chromosome 9.
Of the 28 patients with deletions of derivative chromosome 9, 17 (13%) received nilotinib and 11 (10%)
received dasatinib (P ¼ .47).
Table 1 shows the patient characteristics at the start
of second generation TKI therapy. Among the 28 patients
with deletions of derivative chromosome 9, 22 were in
chronic phase, 4 in accelerated phase, and 2 in blast phase
at the start of nilotinib or dasatinib therapy. In the group
of patients without deletions of derivative chromosome 9,
122 were in chronic phase, 55 in accelerated phase, and
40 in blast phase. The frequency of deletions of derivative
chromosome 9 was similar across the different phases of
the disease: 15%, 7%, and 5% in chronic phase, accelerated phase, and blast phase, respectively (P ¼ .07). However, when comparing chronic phase with advanced
disease (accelerated phase plus blast phase), deletions of
derivative chromosome 9 were found predominantly
among patients in chronic phase (15% vs 6%, P ¼ .03).
There were no significant differences in patient characteristics between patients with or without deletions of derivative chromosome 9, including the incidence of clonal
cytogenetic evolution: 5 of 28 (18%) and 69 of 217
(32%) patients, respectively (P ¼ .19). When divided by
whether a second generation TKI was given in early
chronic phase or in the postimatinib failure setting, no
differences were observed. The distribution of patients
according to Sokal score risk groups was similar for
patients with and without deletions of derivative chromosome 9 (early chronic phase, P ¼ .25; postimatinib failure,
P ¼ .41).
Response to Second Generation TKIs
The response to second generation TKI therapy according
to CML phase at study entry is summarized in Table 2.
After a median of 34 months (range, 5-58 months) of
therapy, 236 (96%) patients were assessable for response.
Among patients with CML in chronic phase, the complete cytogenetic response rate was 77% in those carrying
deletions of derivative chromosome 9 and 81% in those
with an intact derivative chromosome 9 (P ¼ .71). The
rates of major cytogenetic response were 77% and 82%,
respectively (P ¼ .57). Complete cytogenetic response
and major cytogenetic response rates were similar among
patients with CML in chronic phase treated with second
generation TKI as initial therapy whether they carried
deletions of derivative chromosome 9 or not (93% vs

99%, P ¼ .18 for both complete cytogenetic response and
major cytogenetic response). Corresponding complete
cytogenetic response and major cytogenetic response rates
for patients with CML in chronic phase treated after imatinib failure were also similar (50% vs 52%, P ¼ .90, and
62% vs 55%, P ¼ .68) (Table 2). Similarly, no significant
differences in the rates of complete cytogenetic response
or major cytogenetic response were observed between
patients with or without deletions of derivative chromosome 9 in CML accelerated phase (P ¼ .66 and P ¼ .61,
respectively) or in CML blast phase (P ¼ .63 and P ¼ .6,
respectively), indicating that the achievement of complete
cytogenetic response or major cytogenetic response is not
influenced by the presence of deletions of derivative chromosome 9 during nilotinib or dasatinib therapy regardless
of the CML phase. The rates of complete molecular
response and major molecular response for patients with
CML in chronic phase with or without deletions of derivative chromosome 9 were 9% versus 18% (P ¼ .53) and
68% versus 68% (P ¼ 1.0), respectively. Corresponding
complete molecular response and major molecular

response rates for CML in chronic phase patients treated
as initial therapy were 7% and 86% for those with deletions of derivative chromosome 9 and 20% and 80% for
patients without this abnormality (P ¼ .45 for complete
molecular response, P ¼ 1.0 for major molecular
response). Corresponding rates for patients with CML in
chronic phase treated after imatinib failure with or without deletions of derivative chromosome 9 were 12% and
14% for complete molecular response, and 38% and 46%
for major molecular response (P ¼ 1.0 and P ¼ .72). No
significant difference was observed in complete cytogenetic response duration for all patients in chronic phase
with or without deletions of derivative chromosome 9
(81% vs 96%, P ¼ .48). However, a trend toward a longer
duration of complete cytogenetic response was seen in
patients in chronic phase without deletions of derivative
chromosome 9 receiving frontline dasatinib or nilotinib
compared with those with deletions of derivative chromosome 9 (98% vs 73%, P ¼ .05), but no difference was
seen among those receiving therapy after imatinib failure
(90% vs 100%, P ¼ .46).

Survival
We then examined the impact of deletions of derivative
chromosome 9 on survival among patients treated with
second generation TKIs (Table 3). The median follow-up
of the entire cohort was 34 months. At 24 months, the OS
and EFS rates for the whole cohort were 68% and 57%

(Fig. 1, Top). No differences in OS were observed
between the cohorts of patients with or without deletions
of derivative chromosome 9 (70% vs 71%, P ¼ .76) (Fig.
1, Bottom). Accordingly, no differences in OS between
patients with or without deletions of derivative chromosome 9 were observed regardless of disease phase (early
chronic phase, P ¼ 1.0; chronic phase postimatinib failure, P ¼ .05; accelerated phase, P ¼ .54; blast phase, P ¼
.39). Interestingly, despite the absence of significant differences in complete cytogenetic response or major cytogenetic response rates between patients in chronic phase
with and those without deletions of derivative chromosome 9 (Table 2), those without deletions of derivative
chromosome 9 had a trend for an improved EFS and OS
compared with those carrying deletions of derivative chromosome 9 (at 12 months, EFS 91% vs 80%, P ¼ .07; OS
98% vs 96%, P ¼ .08) (Fig. 2), particularly among those
in chronic phase postimatinib failure (EFS 79% vs 63%,
P ¼ .10; OS 96% vs 88%, P ¼ .05) (Table 3). We also
investigated the possible differences in EFS and OS
imparted by nilotinib or dasatinib therapy among patients
in chronic phase according to deletions of derivative chromosome 9 status. Notably, whereas patients with and
without deletions of derivative chromosome 9 treated
with nilotinib had similar OS rates (P ¼ .21), those carrying deletions of derivative chromosome 9 had a worse
EFS (P ¼ .02). However, these outcomes were not significantly affected by deletion of derivative chromosome 9
status in patients receiving dasatinib (EFS, P ¼ .45; OS, P
¼ .76).

Prognostic Factors for OS and EFS in CML in
Chronic Phase
Next, we performed univariate analysis to identify associations between deletions of derivative chromosome 9 status
and prognostic variables that can impact EFS and OS
among patients with CML in chronic phase (Table 4).
The patient and disease characteristics at the start of second generation TKI therapy included in the analysis were:
age, peripheral or bone marrow blast percentage, peripheral blood or bone marrow basophil percentage, duration
of CML, percentage of Phþ metaphases, splenomegaly,
WBC, hemoglobin, platelet count, Sokal risk score, second generation TKI received (dasatinib vs nilotinib), setting in which second generation TKI was used (frontline
vs postimatinib failure), and deletion of derivative chromosome 9 status. By univariate analysis, lower hemoglobin, postimatinib failure (vs frontline) TKI therapy,

longer duration of CML, older age, higher bone marrow
blast percentage, use of nilotinib (vs dasatinib), higher
Sokal score, and deletions of derivative chromosome 9
were found to be poor prognostic factors for EFS in CML
in chronic phase (P < .1). We then performed a multivariate analysis for EFS using a Cox proportional hazards
model, which established postimatinib failure TKI therapy (vs frontline) as the only significant predictive factor
for shorter EFS. A similar analysis was performed for OS.
By univariate analysis, deletion of derivative chromosome
9, higher bone marrow blast percentage, longer duration
of CML, and nilotinib (vs dasatinib) were found to be
associated with shorter OS. Multivariate analysis established older age and increased bone marrow blast percentage as the only significant predictive factors of poor
prognosis for OS.

DISCUSSION
Deletions of derivative chromosome 9 have been reported
in 9% to 15% of patients with CML,4-9 and have been
shown to be an independent powerful adverse prognostic
indicator in patients treated with hydroxyurea or IFN-a,
or undergoing stem cell transplantation.4,5,7,10 The prognostic impact of deletions of derivative chromosome 9
during imatinib therapy has been subject of debate. Initial
studies found no significant difference in survival between
patients with or without deletions of derivative chromosome 9 treated with standard dose imatinib (ie, 400 mg/
d), although patients carrying deletions of derivative chromosome 9 had significantly lower rates of major cytogenetic response (55% vs 75%, P ¼ .008) and progressed
faster to accelerated phase or blast phase.8 Data from our
institution have suggested that high-dose imatinib (800
mg/d) may overcome the poor prognosis of deletion of derivative chromosome 9.6 Two subsequent studies further
supported the neutralizing effect of imatinib on the poor

prognostic impact of deletions of derivative chromosome
9. In 1 study, deletions of derivative chromosome 9 did
not impact the achievement of cytogenetic responses, the
duration of those responses, progression-free survival, or
time to dose escalation of imatinib.9 A multicenter study
from the GIMEMA CML Working Party involving 521
patients with early CML in chronic phase receiving imatinib12 showed no differences in the cumulative incidence
of complete cytogenetic response and major molecular
response or the probabilities of EFS and OS between
patients with and without deletions of derivative chromosome 9 after 5 years of follow-up.12
Although imatinib therapy appears to override the
poor prognostic impact of deletions of derivative chromosome 9, the impact of this cytogenetic abnormality in
patients receiving second generation TKIs is unknown. In
the present study, we investigated the prognostic impact
of deletions of derivative chromosome 9 in 353 patients
with CML treated consecutively with nilotinib or

dasatinib. Deletion of derivative chromosome 9 status was
determined in 245 (69%). We found that the outcome
with nilotinib or dasatinib in patients with advanced
phase CML (ie, accelerated phase or blast phase) did not
differ regardless of their deletions of derivative chromosome 9 status, indicating that advanced phase overrides
whatever prognostic impact deletions of derivative chromosome 9 may have. However, patients with CML in
chronic phase carrying deletions of derivative chromosome 9 exhibited a trend toward worse EFS and OS than
their counterparts with no deletions of derivative chromosome 9, particularly among those in chronic phase postimatinib failure, at variance with what has been previously
reported with imatinib therapy. Nevertheless, multivariate analysis failed to identify this cytogenetic abnormality
as an independent risk factor for EFS or OS.
The potential poor prognostic impact of deletions
of derivative chromosome 9 may be because of the loss of
1 or more tumor suppressor genes mapping to derivative
chromosome 9. The effect of haploinsufficiency of these
genes may be enhanced by secondary hits, loss of expression of the ABL1-BCR transcript being a less likely contributor.20-22 If tumor suppressor haploinsufficiency is
indeed the main mechanism that mediates the deleterious
effect of deletions of derivative chromosome 9, the size of
the deletions occurring at derivative chromosome 9 may
be of critical importance. This issue was addressed in a
recent study involving 339 patients treated with IFN-a
and observed for up to 16 years by using a DNA-based deletion screen based on multiplex ligation-dependent
probe amplification.11 Although no significant survival
differences were observed between patients with (17% of
the cohort) and without derivative chromosome 9,
patients with deletions of derivative chromosome 9 spanning the ABL1-BCR breakpoint had significantly lower
probabilities of survival compared with those carrying
deletions of derivative chromosome 9 involving only 1
side of the breakpoint (P ¼ .039). Surprisingly, patients
with deletions involving only ABL1 or BCR had improved
survival, suggesting that deletions involving both genes
are necessary to confer an adverse prognosis to patients
with CML treated with IFN-a.11 Although it is unknown
whether such results can be extended to patients treated
with imatinib, the lack of information regarding the exact
mapping of deletions of derivative chromosome 9 is an
obvious shortcoming of our analysis. It should be noted
that in our study, deletions of derivative chromosome 9
were detected using the Vysis extrasignal probe, which
detects losses of genomic sequences of ABL1 but not of

BCR. Although it is certainly possible that an unusual
enrichment of patients carrying deletions involving exclusively ABL1 or BCR sequences may have contributed to
the worse outcome of patients with CML in chronic phase
carrying deletions of derivative chromosome 9 during
therapy with second generation TKIs, this is unlikely, as
most instances of deletions involve the ABL1-BCR breakpoint.4,7,8,20 Given that approximately two-thirds of
patients in our analysis received second generation TKIs
after imatinib failure, a potential explanation as to why
second generation TKIs do not appear as efficacious as
imatinib at overcoming the poor prognostic effect of deletions of derivative chromosome 9 may reside in the finding that those patients had a higher probability of having
acquired secondary hits, which in addition to deletions of
derivative chromosome 9 may impair the efficacy of second generation TKIs.
In summary, in line with what has been reported
with imatinib therapy, our results suggest that deletions of
derivative chromosome 9 are not an independent adverse
prognostic factor for EFS or OS in patients with CML in
chronic phase receiving second generation TKIs. These
results support the exclusion of deletions of derivative
chromosome 9 as a warning sign from the European LeukemiaNet guidelines and minimize their prognostic value.
