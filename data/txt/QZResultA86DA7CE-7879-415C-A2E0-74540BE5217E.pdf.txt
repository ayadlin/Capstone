Abstract
Targeting epigenetic pathways is a promising approach for
cancer therapy. Here, we report on the unexpected ﬁnding that
targeting calcium signaling can reverse epigenetic silencing of
tumor suppressor genes (TSG). In a screen for drugs that
reactivate silenced gene expression in colon cancer cells, we
found three classical epigenetic targeted drugs (DNA methylation and histone deacetylase inhibitors) and 11 other drugs
that induced methylated and silenced CpG island promoters
driving a reporter gene (GFP) as well as endogenous TSGs in
multiple cancer cell lines. These newly identiﬁed drugs, most

prominently cardiac glycosides, did not change DNA methylation locally or histone modiﬁcations globally. Instead, all 11
drugs altered calcium signaling and triggered calcium-calmodulin kinase (CamK) activity, leading to MeCP2 nuclear exclusion. Blocking CamK activity abolished gene reactivation and
cancer cell killing by these drugs, showing that triggering
calcium ﬂuxes is an essential component of their epigenetic
mechanism of action. Our data identify calcium signaling as a
new pathway that can be targeted to reactivate TSGs in cancer.

Introduction

novo methylation in cytosine of CpG dinucleotide at the promoter
region of TSG results in stable gene silencing through direct
inhibition of transcription factor binding or by recruitment of
methyl-binding domain (MBD) proteins such as MeCP2 (1, 2).
These MBDs are associated with other repressor complexes including histone deacetylases (HDAC) that are responsible for global
loss of histone acetylation, resulting in gene silencing and heterochromatin formation (2).
As these epigenetic modiﬁcations are reversible, one goal of
epigenetic therapy of cancer is to reverse these alterations and
induce TSG reactivation, leading to cancer cell differentiation and
cancer cell death (3). Clinical efﬁcacy of epigenetic drugs led to
their approval for the treatment of hematologic malignancies and
occasional proof-of-principle responses can be seen in solid
tumors (2, 4). However, treatment options are limited to a small
number of epigenetic drugs approved in the clinic with two DNA
methylation inhibitors (decitabine and azacitidine) and two
HDAC inhibitors (vorinostat and depsipeptide). There is a need
to discover new candidate epigenetic drugs, including some that
work through other mechanisms of action. Drug discovery initiatives are underway in rare and speciﬁc cancer types with welldeﬁned mutations in epigenetic effectors. However, these efforts
may take years before approval and may have limited effects
outside of a restricted patient population (5).
To discover new epigenetic drugs that can be rapidly tested in
the clinic, we performed an unbiased epigenetic drug screen
using FDA-approved drug libraries. The rationale is that positive hits can be rapidly repositioned for cancer treatment
because these drugs have known safety, pharmacodynamics,
and pharmacokinetics (6). As a platform for epigenetic drug

In cancer, the epigenome is aberrantly reprogrammed, leading
to a wide range of heritable changes in gene expression such as
silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSG; ref. 1). The most
studied epigenetic aberrations in cancer involve DNA methylation
and histone posttranslational modiﬁcations. Acquisition of de

screening, we used the well-characterized YB5 cell-based system, which is derived from the human colon cancer cell line,
SW48 (7, 8). YB5 cells contain a single insertion of cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter driving GFP gene. GFP expression is
silenced in >99.9% of YB5 cells by epigenetic mechanisms
because its CMV promoter has DNA hypermethylation and is
embedded in repressive chromatin with histone deacetylation
and histone methylation marks (Fig. 1A; ref. 7). In YB5 cells,
GFP behaves similarly to endogenous TSGs silenced by epigenetic mechanisms and it can be reactivated by treatment with
DNA methylation inhibitors and/or HDAC inhibitors (7, 8).
We previously demonstrated that GFP reactivation induced by
decitabine is characterized by both DNA demethylation and
chromatin resetting at the CMV promoter region (7). Moreover,
we also showed that HDAC inhibitors induced GFP reactivation
through chromatin resetting at the CMV promoter with an
increase in histone acetylation without any changes in DNA
methylation (8). As the goal of the epigenetic therapy is to

reactivate silenced TSGs, we used the YB5 system as a cell-based
assay for epigenetic drug screening.
Here, our screen revealed a new mechanism where targeting
calcium signaling can reactivate TSGs silenced by epigenetic
mechanism in cancer cells. The alteration in calcium signaling
results in activated calcium-calmodulin kinase (CamK), which
played a central role in TSG reactivation and cancer cell killing.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Human colon cancer cell line YB5 and its parental cell line
SW48 were cultured in L-15 medium. Human colon cancer cell
line HCT116 was cultured in McCoy's medium. In HCT116
human colon cancer cells, GFP sequence was inserted in exon 2
of the TSG secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1) making the
HCT116 SFRP1-GFP cell line. This locus is silenced by promoter
DNA hypermethylation in HCT116 (9). GFP expression detected

by ﬂow cytometry corresponded to the activity of SFRP1 promoter
and was measured in less than 10% of the cells. Normal colon
cells, CRL-1831, were grown in DMEM F-12 medium supplemented with 10 ng/mL cholera toxin, 0.005 mg/mL insulin, 0.005
mg/mL transferrin, 100 ng/mL hydrocortisone, and 100 mmol/L
HEPES. Leukemia cell lines, K562 and HL-60, were cultured in
RPMI1640. HEK293T were grown in DMEM. All cell culture
media were supplemented with 10% FBS. Colon cancer and
leukemic cells were grown in log phase in 1% and 5% CO2
atmosphere, respectively. SW48, K562, and HL-60 cell lines were
obtained from ATCC (2005–2007) and were authenticated at MD
Anderson Cancer Center genomic core facility by DNA ﬁngerprinting in 2011. CRL-1831 cell line was obtained from ATCC in
2012 and used within 2 months from the purchase. HCT116 and
HEK293T were obtained from the laboratories of S.B. Baylin and
D.L. Gill and were genetically engineered cell lines that were not
further authenticated.
Drugs and treatments
Drug libraries of FDA-approved drugs were obtained from NCIDevelopmental Therapeutics Program (Combo Plate 3948/99
containing 77 drugs, NCI Oncology Drug set 4640/34 containing
52 drugs, NCI Oncology Drug set 4641/34 with 37 drugs) and
from commercially available U.S. Drug collection library with
1,040 drugs (MS Discovery). A total of 1,118 unique FDAapproved drugs were screened. Log-phase growing YB5 cells were
treated with drug libraries (n  1) using two different schedules.
The ﬁrst schedule consisted of a 72-hour treatment at 10 mmol/L
where drugs and media were replaced every day. Cells were
incubated for an additional 24 hours without drugs before analysis. This schedule was designed to discover putative new hypomethylating agents as the induction of DNA demethylation may
require several cell divisions to become detectable (2). The second
schedule consisted of a 24-hour treatment at 50 mmol/L. Cells
were immediately analyzed after the treatment. This schedule was
designed to discover drugs that would reactivate GFP by chromatin remodeling because, in this cell line, HDAC inhibitors can
reactivate GFP in 24 hours without any changes in DNA methylation at the CMV promoter. For validation purposes and pharmacologic (leptomycin L2913) modulation, drugs were purchased at Sigma-Aldrich and dissolved either in DMSO, ethanol,
or sterile PBS according to the manufacturer's recommendations
and stocks were kept frozen at 80 C. CamK inhibitors were
purchased at EMD Millipore (Kn-93, 422712 and Kn-92,
422709).
Flow cytometry
After treatment, cells were trypsinized and resuspended in
cell culture media with propidium iodide (PI) to stain dead
cells. For epigenetic drug screening with YB5 cells, GFP and PI
ﬂuorescence were measured using BD LSR II ﬂow cytometer.
Validations were performed using Millipore Guava ﬂow cytometer with YB5 or SFRP1-GFP HCT116 cells. Flow cytometry
analysis was also used prior to any type of extractions (RNA,
DNA, and proteins) to ensure a similar level of GFP reactivation
following drug treatments for each biologic replicate. Flow
cytometry results were plotted as GFP ﬂuorescence on the xaxis and PI on the y-axis (Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1D).
Positive hits were designated using two selection criteria. First,
we excluded all autoﬂuorescent drugs (like antimalarials)
because autoﬂuorescence creates a false positive signal that

1496 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

bleaches into GFP channel. Drugs that showed more than
8% of the cells in the double positive quadrant were discarded.
This threshold value was calculated as the sum of the average
plus one SD of the percentage of cells detected in the double
positive quadrant in the entire screen dataset. Second, the
lowest detection threshold for GFP reactivation was set at
2.2% of the cells present in the GFPþ quadrant. This value was
established experimentally and corresponded to the lowest GFP
value obtained in the screen that was conﬁrmed during our
validation step with drugs purchased from independent
suppliers.
RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, qPCR
Total RNA (2 mg) was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and
cDNA was synthesized using High-Capacity cDNA Kit (Applied
Biosystems). Quantiﬁcation of cDNA was done by qPCR with the
Universal PCR Master Mix (Bio-Rad) using ABI Prism 7900HT
system. Results were obtained from at least three independent
experiments where each sample was analyzed in triplicate. 18S
was used as a reference gene. All primers have been described
previously (7, 8).
DNA extraction and DNA methylation analysis
DNA extraction, bisulﬁte conversion, and pyrosequencing were
carried out as previously described (7, 8).
Histone extraction and Western blots
For acid histone extraction, cells were harvested and washed
twice with ice-cold PBS supplemented with 10 mmol/L sodium
butyrate to retain levels of histone acetylation. Cell pellets were
resuspended cells in Triton Extraction Buffer [TEB:PBS containing
0.5% Triton X100 (v/v), 2 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylﬂuoride, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, complete protease inhibitor cocktail, 10
mmol/L sodium butyrate]. Cell lysis was induced after 10 minutes
incubation on ice with gentle stirring. Lysates were centrifuged at
6,500  g for 10 minutes at 4 C. Supernatant was discarded. Cells
were washed in half the volume of TEB and centrifuged as before.
Pellets were resuspended in 0.2 N HCl. Histones were acid
extracted overnight at 4 C. Samples were centrifuged at 6,500
 g for 10 minutes at 4 C. Histone proteins contained in the
supernatant were saved and protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay. Extracted histones were stored
at 80 C. Histone extracts were run in 12% SDS–PAGE precast
gels (Bio-Rad, 345-0118). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes in 10 mmol/L CAPS (pH
11) containing 10% methanol and detected by using speciﬁc
primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare) and Enhanced Chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). PVDF membranes were incubated with
speciﬁc primary antibodies. Commercially available antibodies
were purchased for H3K4-3me (Active motif, 39159), H3K9-3me
(Abcam, AB 8898), H3K14-Ac (Active motif, 39697), H3K9-Ac
(Active motif, 39917), H3K27-3me (Active motif, 39155),
H3K27-Ac (Upstate Biotechnology, 07360), H3 (Active motif,
39763), and MeCP2 (Abcam, AB2828).
Statistical analysis
Differences between groups were assessed using a one-way
ANOVA. The P value was evaluated by the Tukey–Kramer multiple
comparison test. Statistics and graphical representations were
performed using GraphPad Prism software.

Targeting Calcium Signaling Produces Epigenetic Reactivation

Results
Epigenetic drug screening and positive hits validation
We screened over 1,100 FDA-approved drugs obtained from
the NCI and commercial sources using two dose schedules (Fig.
1B). The ﬁrst schedule (10 mmol/L for 72 hours followed by 24
hours without drug) was designed to discover epigenetic drugs
that require several cell cycles to induce robust gene reactivation, as observed with DNA methylation inhibitors. This schedule induced signiﬁcant DNA demethylation and was associated
with gene reactivation in YB5 cells (7). The second schedule (50
mmol/L for 24 hours) was selected to discover epigenetic drugs
that produce rapid gene reactivation, as seen with HDAC
inhibitors. On the basis of the very low background in the
YB5 system (less than 0.1% of the cells express detectable levels
of GFP; Supplementary Fig. S1A) and activity seen in negative
controls, positive hits in the screen were deﬁned as those nonautoﬂuorescent drugs inducing more than 2.2% of GFPþ cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1B–S1E).
The drug screen revealed 23 (2%) and 77 (7%) positive hits at
10 mmol/L (for 72 hours) and at 50 mmol/L (for 24 hours)
respectively, whereas 12 drugs (1%) were identiﬁed in both
schedules (Fig. 1C–E). The highest inducers of GFP expression
were the DNA methylation inhibitors decitabine (at 10 mmol/L,
for 72 hours) and azacitidine (at 50 mmol/L, for 24 hours)
producing, respectively, 30% and 16% GFPþ cells (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Azacitidine induced GFP reactivation after
a short treatment of 24 hours, which can be explained by the
number of YB5 cells in S-phase during the treatment (2). The
HDAC inhibitor vorinostat was also identiﬁed in this screen
producing 2.6% GFPþ cells (Supplementary Table S2). Thus, all
three known epigenetic drugs represented in the libraries were
rediscovered in this blinded screen, validating the approach.
Because of the unexpected large number of positive hits, we
focused on the 12 drugs identiﬁed in both dose schedules (Fig. 1E).
For validation, compounds were purchased from separate suppliers
and tested for GFP reactivation in YB5 cells. Of these 12 hits, all
except tilmicosin (which was low positive) were validated. These 11
validated drugs fell into three groups (Fig. 1F). The ﬁrst one
included the known epigenetic drugs decitabine, azacitidine, and
vorinostat. The second group encompassed cardiac glycosides such
as ouabain, lanatoside C, digoxin, digitoxin, and proscillaridin A.
All cardiac glycosides represented in the libraries reactivated GFP,
suggesting a drug class effect. The last group was labeled as antibiotics/others and contained oxyquinoline (antibiotic), disulﬁram
(a drug used for alcoholism treatment), and arsenic trioxide (anticancer drug; Fig. 1F). In the validation studies, GFP reactivation was
tested at multiple doses (Fig. 2A–F). All cardiac glycosides induced
dose-dependent GFP reactivation in the nanomolar range at clinically relevant concentrations, with proscillaridin A being the most
potent (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). We also validated three
additional antibiotics (pyrithion zinc, cycloheximide, and thiram)
in the antibiotic/others subgroup that were identiﬁed in the screen
at 50 mmol/L only but were positive during the validation using
both schedules. Therefore, we validated a total of 14 FDA-approved
drugs encompassing three well-known epigenetic drugs and 11
candidate epigenetic drugs.
No changes in classical epigenetic pathways
We conﬁrmed GFP mRNA reactivation after 24 hours treatment
by qPCR (Fig. 3A). We also detected gene reactivation in three

endogenous TSGs silenced by epigenetic mechanism in YB5 cells
(CDH13, RIL, TIMP-3) as well as the stress response gene P21
(CDKN1A; Supplementary Fig. S3A–S3D). In addition, we measured SFRP1 reactivation, another DNA hypermethylated TSG in
HCT116 colon cancer cells (9, 10). In this cell line, GFP sequence
was inserted in exon 2 of SFRP1 making its activation detectable
by ﬂow cytometry (9). Similar to YB5 cells, all drugs reactivated
SFRP1 gene in the HCT116 SFRP1-GFP system (Fig. 3B). To
identify a mechanism of action, we asked whether candidate
epigenetic drugs induced gene reactivation through known epigenetic mechanism such as DNA demethylation or histone acetylation. First, we measured DNA methylation locally in the
promoter regions of reactivated genes (CMV and endogenous
TSGs) and at LINE-1 repeats to assess global DNA methylation
levels. Using bisulﬁte pyrosequencing assays designed in the
promoter regions close to the transcription start site (8), we found
that none of the drugs reduced DNA methylation at the CMV (Fig.
3C) or TIMP-3 (Supplementary Fig. S4A) promoters or globally at
LINE-1 repeats (Fig. 3D), except for decitabine (a well-known
hypomethylating drug). We then measured quantitatively histone
acetylation levels by mass spectrometry on 9 residues in histone 3
(H3) and histone 4 (H4). No signiﬁcant changes were observed,
except with vorinostat, a well-known HDAC inhibitor that
increased histone acetylation levels on lysine 9, 14, 18, and 23
of histone 3 and on lysine 8, 12, and 16 of histone H4 (Fig. 3E and
Supplementary Fig. S4B). A similar lack of global effects was
observed by Western blots for histone-activating marks (H3K4me3, H3K9-ac, and H3K27-ac) or histone-inactivating marks
(H3K9-me3 and H3K27-me3; Supplementary Fig. S4C).
Intracellular Ca2þ ﬂuxes induced by the newly identiﬁed drugs
As neither DNA demethylation nor global chromatin modiﬁcations explained TSG reactivation by the newly identiﬁed drugs,
we searched for alternative mechanisms. Surprisingly, when
searching for a mechanism of action of the newly identiﬁed drugs,
we noted that most of the (9/11) drugs were known to increase
intracellular calcium (Ca2þ) levels (11–14). No data were found
regarding the three known epigenetic drugs and calcium signaling.
Interestingly, it was reported in neurons that cytosolic increase in
Ca2þ levels activate CamK, which releases the methyl-binding
protein MeCP2 from silenced promoters, leading to gene reactivation (15, 16).
To test whether this mechanism could explain TSGs reactivation in cancer cells by the newly identiﬁed drugs, we ﬁrst characterized Ca2þ channels in YB5 cells. Using Ca2þ sensitive dye
(fura-2), we determined that YB5 cells do not express functional
L-type voltage-operated Ca2þ channels (Supplementary Fig. S5A
and S5B). Instead, YB5 cells have functional plasma membrane
store-operated Ca2þ entry (SOCe) channels, which transport
extracellular Ca2þ into the cytosol in response to a decrease in
Ca2þ level in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) store. The activity of
these plasma membrane channels was demonstrated by the effect
of SOCe inhibitors reducing cytosolic Ca2þ entry triggered by the
ER Ca2þ pump blocker, thapsigargin (Supplementary Fig. S5C;
refs. 17, 18).
Then, we characterized the effects of drug treatments in YB5
cells on cytosolic Ca2þ levels at rest, ER Ca2þ levels and SOCe
activity in response to Ca2þ ionophore, ionomycin or thapsigargin followed by the addition of 1 mmol/L Ca2þ in the media (a
cation-safe solution). Interestingly, known epigenetic drugs did
not alter Ca2þ homeostasis (Fig. 4A). However, cardiac glycosides

and arsenic trioxide reduced ER Ca2þ levels (ﬁrst peak) while
strongly inhibiting SOCe-mediated Ca2þ entry (second peak; Fig.
4B and Supplementary Fig. S5D). Even though ER Ca2þ levels
were signiﬁcantly reduced, we could not measure an increase in
cytosolic Ca2þ, suggesting a transient spark in cytosolic Ca2þ after
treatment with digitalis compounds (19). In another model of
HEK293 cells expressing the genetically encoded calcium sensors
(D1ER cameleon system) speciﬁcally expressed in the ER, we
conﬁrmed digitoxin-induced reduction in ER Ca2þ (Supplementary Fig. S5E; 20). Finally, we could detect an increased cytosolic
Ca2þ level (higher baseline Ca2þ signal) after only pyrithion zinc
treatment whereas both pyrithion zinc and disulﬁram increased

1498 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

Ca2þ levels in the ER (ﬁrst peak; Fig. 4C). Thus, most of the
candidate epigenetic drugs induce measurable intracellular Ca2þ
changes in YB5 cells by different mechanisms of action, which
result in cytosolic Ca2þ sparks or sustained increased levels. It is
noteworthy that cardiac glycosides are well-known Naþ/KþATPase pump blockers used in heart failure treatment (11). To
assess the impact of Naþ/Kþ-ATPase pump inhibition on GFP
reactivation in YB5 cells, we treated YB5 cells with orthovanadate,
an inorganic Naþ/Kþ-ATPase inhibitor and did not detect GFP
reactivation. These data suggest that the epigenetic activity of
cardiac glycosides might be independent of Naþ/Kþ-ATPase (data
not shown).

We further explored the mechanism of SOCe inhibition
induced by cardiac glycosides. SOCe is mediated by the highly
Ca2þ-selective Orai1 channels, which are activated by STIM proteins in response to a decrease in ER Ca2þ levels. STIM translocates
into ER-plasma membrane junctions to tether and activate Orai1
channels (21, 22). For these experiments, we used a well-established model of HEK293 cells overexpressing Orai1-CFP and
STIM1-YFP (23). We found that digitoxin did not affect STIM1Orai1 coupling as maximal FRET signal between STIM1 and
Orai1, obtained after ionomycin treatment, was unaltered by
digitoxin (Supplementary Fig. S5F). Wild-type and overexpressing
STIM1-Orai1 HEK293 cells showed similar inhibition of SOCe
and reduction in ER Ca2þ size by digitoxin (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S5G). Importantly, these effects on Ca2þ levels were

www.aacrjournals.org

not caused by changes in cytosolic pH (Supplementary Fig.
S5H; refs. 20, 24, 25). Finally, digitoxin speciﬁcally inhibited
Ca2þ inﬂux through Orai1 in HEK293 cells expressing either
constitutively active STIM1 mutant (STIM1D76A) or constitutively active Orai1 mutant (O1-V102C; Fig. 4E and F; 26). In
these experiments, we used the antihistamine fexofenadine as a
control for speciﬁcity of action as this drug treatment does not
induce GFP reactivation. Together, the data demonstrate that
cardiac glycosides altered Ca2þ levels by causing potent SOCe
inhibition.
Ca2þ signaling through CamK is essential for gene reactivation
CamK, a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase, is a central
molecule that is activated by an increase in cytosolic Ca2þ, leading

to gene expression changes in part caused by the unbinding of
chromatin repressors such as the methyl-binding protein MeCP2
from their silenced promoters (15, 27–29). Except for known
epigenetic drugs, all candidate epigenetic drugs induce intracellular Ca2þ changes. Thus, we tested the role of CamK in YB5 cells
treated with known and candidate epigenetic drugs. Druginduced reactivation of GFP and endogenous TSGs (TIMP-3 and
WIF-1) was signiﬁcantly reduced by pharmacologic inhibition of
CamKII using Kn-93 whereas Kn-92, its weaker analogue, had a
much smaller effect (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B;
ref. 30). As expected, GFP expression induced by azacitidine was
not sensitive to Kn-93 inhibition as this hypomethylating drug
did not alter Ca2þ ﬂuxes (Fig. 5A).

1500 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

We next hypothesized that the epigenetic effects of CamK
activation by Ca2þ signaling relate to unbinding of MeCP2 from
repressed promoters, as previously reported in normal neuronal
cells (15, 16, 28, 29). Using ChIP-qPCR following cardiac glycoside treatment (Lanatoside C), we found that MeCP2 occupancy
was reduced at several DNA hypermethylated promoters (Supplementary Fig. S7), suggesting that drug-induced dissociation of
MeCP2 binding is associated with gene reactivation. Most interestingly, using confocal microscopy, we observed nuclear versus
cytoplasmic redistribution of MeCP2 after proscillaridin treatment (Fig. 5B). Following 24-hour and 48-hour treatment with
proscillaridin at 500 nmol/L, MeCP2 staining was enriched in the
cytoplasm in most of the cells (Fig. 5B). In untreated cells, MeCP2

we showed that these effects of the positive hits identiﬁed in the
screen may relate to export of regulatory proteins from the nucleus
to the cytoplasm. Blocking the exportin pathway of protein
transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by leptomycin
signiﬁcantly reduced drug-induced GFP reactivation in YB5 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S10).
As CamKII appeared to mediate gene reactivation, we next
tested whether the selective cancer cell killing was also CamKIIdependent. Percentages of apoptotic cells, viable cells, and dead
cells were measured in colon cancer (YB5 and its parent cell line
SW48) and leukemia (K562 and HL-60) cell lines following 48hour drug treatment alone or in combination with CamKII
inhibitor, Kn-93 and its less active derivative, Kn-92. For all cell
lines, drugs signiﬁcantly induced cytotoxicity whereas, as expected
for this brief treatment period, hypomethylating drugs did not.
Kn-93 rescued almost completely the drug-induced toxic effects
(Fig. 5C and Supplementary Figs. S11–S13). These data suggest
that CamK activation is a key effector of the anticancer activity of
these FDA-approved drugs.
Anticancer activity and cancer selectivity
We next assessed the anticancer activity of the newly identiﬁed
candidate epigenetic drugs in YB5 cells. Anchorage-dependent
colony formation assays were performed for long-term cytotoxicity evaluation. All drugs reduced cancer cell survival in a dose
and time-dependent manner (Fig. 6A–C). Anticancer activity was
stronger for the newly identiﬁed drugs compared with known
epigenetic drugs. Anchorage-independent colony assays were
then performed by gauging colony formation in soft agar. All
drugs produced a signiﬁcant dose-dependent reduction in the
number of colonies; with proscillaridin A being the most potent
(Fig. 6D). To address the question of cancer cell selectivity, we
compared the viability of normal colon cells (CRL-1831) versus
colon cancer cells (SW48). We used YB5's parental cell line SW48
for this because GFP expression could affect viability measurements performed by ﬂow cytometry. After 48-hour treatment at
doses producing the strongest GFP reactivation in YB5 cells, cell
viability was reduced in cancer cells but not in normal cells (Fig.
6E) demonstrating the cancer selectivity of these drugs.

Discussion
There is a need to discover new epigenetic targets and drugs to
induce TSG reactivation in cancer cells. The arsenal of epigenetic
drugs approved in the clinic is currently limited to only four drugs
targeting only two separate mechanisms. On the basis of the high
number of epigenetic targets in cancer, there is a great interest in
discovering new targets that can be used to reactivate TSGs and
reprogram cancer cells to eradicate their clonogenic potential and
induce their differentiation. We used our live cell-based assay
where we measured GFP reactivation as surrogate for TSG reactivation. Overall, we identiﬁed 14 hits including 3 well-known
epigenetic drugs and 11 other FDA-approved drugs encompassing
cardiac glycosides and some antibiotics.
To identify the mechanism responsible for GFP and endogenous TSGs reactivation, we ﬁrst analyzed promoter DNA methylation and histone modiﬁcations. No changes were detected after
treatment with the cardiac glycosides or the antibiotics while TSG
reactivation was detected. Surprisingly, we noticed that most of
the newly identiﬁed drugs are known to induce alterations in Ca2þ
signaling in normal cells. We demonstrated that these changes in

1502 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

Ca2þ signaling also occurred in our cancer cell screening system
(YB5 cells) and only after treatment with the newly epigenetic
drugs but not with well-known epigenetic drugs such as DNA
methylation and HDAC inhibitors. This difference suggested a
separate mechanism of action. Our data showed that reactivation
of endogenous epigenetically silenced TSGs was linked to Ca2þ
signaling and CamK activation. Mechanistically, our data suggest
that gene reactivation may involve gene derepression by inducing
MeCP2 eviction from repressed promoters to the cytoplasm
through the exportin pathway (Supplementary Fig. S14). Interestingly, the anticancer activity could also be modulated by CamK
pharmacologic inhibition.
Consistent with our work, other studies have demonstrated a
CamK-dependent mechanism producing MeCP2 release from
silenced promoters, leading to gene reactivation (15, 28, 29).
Interestingly, our data further demonstrate redistribution of
MeCP2 to the cytoplasm after drug-induced CamK activation.
The relationship between MeCP2 binding to methylated-CpGs
and Ca2þ has been described in neurons where MeCP2 phosphorylation is involved in intracellular localization during neuronal differentiation (31, 32). Phosphorylation sites of MeCP2 are
known to modify its binding to other epigenetic cofactors but
more studies are needed to clearly understand the role of CamK
and MeCP2 phosphorylation sites. Nevertheless, our study shows
that the CamK–MeCP2 interaction previously linked only to
differentiation can be exploited against cancer cells to reactivate
silenced TSG. These data also demonstrate a key role for calcium
ﬂuxes in epigenetic silencing in neoplasia.
Interestingly, we identiﬁed a class effect for the cardiac glycoside
subgroup where all these heart failure drugs present in the libraries
scored positive in the screen and also separately validated. These
drugs are relevant for cancer treatment because epidemiologic
studies have shown that patients treated with cardiac glycosides
for heart failure exhibit a reduced cancer rate and less aggressive
cancers (11, 33, 34). Moreover, in vitro studies have previously
shown selective cancer killing for some of these cardiac glycosides,
which we now relate to Ca2þ signaling and TSG reactivation (35).
Our data suggest that their chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic
activity may be in part due to their ability to target Ca2þ ﬂuxes and
reactivate epigenetically silenced TSGs. Another drug we identiﬁed as having effects on gene silencing is arsenic trioxide, which
has marked activity in acute promyelocytic leukemia (36), a
disease characterized by a block in cell differentiation (37). Our
data suggest that epigenetic modulation may be part of its
antineoplastic mechanism of action. Interestingly, cytotoxic drugs
or targeted drugs (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitors) used in cancer
chemotherapy did not reactivate GFP, pointing to the speciﬁcity of
the identiﬁed hits. This was veriﬁed separately from the screen for
many cytotoxic drugs (38). Thus, the mechanism of action of the
positive hits is likely to be speciﬁc disruption of epigenetic pathways involved in gene silencing rather than nonspeciﬁc effects
seen with many antiproliferatives.
Finally, it is worth noting that Ca2þ signaling is essential to
initiating epigenetic reprogramming in early embryogenesis (39)
and our data extend these ﬁndings to cancer therapy. Also, the
mechanism of epigenetic action of these drugs is unlikely to be
traced to a single chromatin regulator; rather, Ca2þ signaling
through CamK activation may have effects on multiple epigenetic
acting proteins simultaneously. It will be interesting to determine
what targets, other than MeCP2, might be phosphorylated by
CamK activation.

In summary, our data identify Ca2þ signaling as a new pathway
that can be targeted to reactivate TSGs in cancer. This study suggest
that cardiac glycosides and other FDA-approved drugs such as
some antibiotics represent interesting drugs for cancer epigenetic
chemotherapy aiming to reactivate epigenetically silenced TSGs.
