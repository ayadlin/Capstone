Bortezomib has demonstrated substantial activity in the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma and is widely incorporated into
treatment strategies across the different settings. It is interesting to note that data are accumulating to suggest that the activity of
bortezomib extends beyond the tumor cell and microenvironment to encompass effects on bone metabolism. Indeed, data from both
the preclinical and clinical settings have suggested that bortezomib directly stimulates osteoblast growth and differentiation, while
also inhibiting osteoclast development and activity. Notably, in the clinical setting, the bone anabolic effects of bortezomib could be
demonstrated by the healing of lytic lesions as noted in some patients. These results are of importance because bone disease is a
hallmark of myeloma and therefore any agent that combines antimyeloma activity with positive effects on bone is of substantial interest. However, further studies are needed to establish how the agent should be used for the treatment of patients with bone disease.

INTRODUCTION
Bortezomib has become one of the most important novel agents in the current therapy for multiple myeloma (MM). This
agent has demonstrated substantial activity in the setting of recurrent=refractory disease and, more recently, in the frontline setting; in the latter setting, it was shown to be superior to conventional treatments in both the transplant and nontransplant protocols.1-10
Bortezomib exerts its potent antimyeloma activity in 2 predominant ways: it directly impacts myeloma cell survival
through the downregulation of growth=survival signaling pathways and the upregulation of molecules implicated in proapoptotic cascades, and it acts on the bone marrow microenvironment by interfering with the adhesion of MM cells to
bone marrow stromal cells. This inhibits the production of cytokines in the bone marrow and restricts the development of
tumor-associated blood vessels.11-13 In addition, data are accumulating that indicate that the effects of bortezomib extend
beyond the MM cell and that the agent influences other processes, such as bone metabolism. Indeed, the proteasome plays
a crucial role in the degradation of regulatory proteins such as cell cycle and tumor suppressor proteins, transcription factors, and mutant or damaged proteins. It is therefore fundamentally involved in the activation and inactivation of many
cellular processes and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis.14 Inhibition of the proteasome results in growth arrest and
cell death, believed to be due to the induction of an apoptotic cascade as a result of the rapid accumulation of regulatory
proteins within the cell. The transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-jB) is one of the proteins that is regulated by
proteasomal activity. In the cytoplasm, bound to its inhibitor IjB, NF-jB is inactive. However, in response to stimuli,
IjB is degraded by the proteasome, thereby releasing NF-jB, which, at the time of translocation into the nucleus, initiates
the transcription of a wide range of genes encoding proteins involved in cell survival, cell adhesion, and cytokine

signaling.15 NF-jB has been found to be constitutively
active in some cancer cells and to be associated with resistance to anticancer therapy.16 The constitutive activation of
NF-jB has been shown to promote the expression of cytokines with proinflammatory and proangiogenic activities.17
In patients with MM, NF-jB activation has been shown to
promote the growth, survival, and drug resistance of MM
cells in the bone marrow microenvironment.18,19 Therefore,
NF-jB has been identified as an attractive target for anticancer agents and as a target in patients with MM in particular. Conversely, NF-jB is also a key regulator of proteins
involved in immune or inflammation responses.20,21 The
inhibitory action of bortezomib is mediated in part through
the stabilization of the NF-jB inhibitor IjB, resulting in
the inhibition of NF-jB.11,16 However, it is recognized that
bortezomib also affects additional cell survival pathways,
such as the p44=42 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.22 Furthermore, inhibitory effects on interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-a, and vascular endothelial growth
factor have also been demonstrated.12,23,24
Thus, the multifaceted effects of bortezomib provide
the rationale for the investigation of the agent in patients
with malignant disease and particularly in those with
MM. The objective of the current review was to address
the effects of bortezomib outside the tumor cell.
Myeloma-Associated Bone Disease
Pathophysiology

Bone disease is a hallmark of MM. Myeloma bone disease
is due to an imbalance in bone remodeling characterized by
increased osteolytic bone destruction that is not compensated for by new bone formation. This imbalance in bone
metabolism arises from the activity of myeloma cells, which
promote osteoclast function, thereby mediating bone
destruction while simultaneously suppressing osteoblast activity, resulting in the prevention of new bone formation.25-27 The regulation of bone remodeling is in large
part controlled by a cytokine system consisting of receptor
activator of NF-jB ligand (RANKL) and its cellular receptor RANK, as well as the decoy receptor for RANKL, osteoprotegerin (OPG). Maturation and activation of osteoclasts
is initiated by the binding of RANKL to RANK, which is
expressed on the surface of osteoclasts. Binding of OPG to
RANKL neutralizes the ligand, thereby preventing osteoclast maturation and the accompanying bone resorption.
The balance between RANKL and OPG, which exists in
healthy bones, is disturbed in patients with MM in favor of
RANKL, which is produced by myeloma cells themselves,
as well as bone marrow stromal cells as a result of stimulation through myeloma cells. Furthermore, myeloma cells
Cancer

inhibit the production of OPG by stromal cells, further
contributing to the imbalance between the 2 factors. Other
factors produced by myeloma cells, such as macrophage
inflammatory protein-1a and interleukin-6, contribute to
increased osteoclast activity, further adding to the promotion of bone resorption. This in turn causes the release of
cytokines and growth factors that promote myeloma cell
growth. The result is a vicious cycle of bone destruction
and myeloma cell growth.
In addition, myeloma cells inhibit osteoblasts, an
effect that is mediated by dickkopf-1 (DKK-1), an inhibitor of the wingless-type (Wnt) signaling pathway, which
is important in osteoblast maturation. Furthermore, other
factors important to this process, such as secreted frizzlerelated protein-2, another Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor, and the transcription factor runt-related transcription
factor 2 (Runx2)=core-binding factor subunit alpha-1
(Cbfa1) are believed to be affected by myeloma cells and
further contribute to a reduction in osteoblast activity.
Bortezomib and Bone Disease: Preclinical Data

The first indication of a potential role for proteasome inhibitors in patients with bone disease from MM was provided
by Garrett et al, who observed that the treatment of murine
bone tissue with proteasome inhibitors increased osteoblast
differentiation and bone formation in vitro.28 These investigators found a strong correlation between the magnitude of
stimulation of bone formation activity and the degree of
proteasome inhibition of the different agents. Bone formation was found to be mediated through the stimulation of
bone morphogenetic protein-2 production in osteoblasts.
These data indicated that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation
and bone formation. Furthermore, Zavrski et al found that
the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway also plays an important
role in the regulation of osteoclast development.29 In preclinical experiments, the investigators observed that proteasome inhibitors impeded osteoclast differentiation and
function and that the decrease in resorption correlated with
the extent of NF-jB binding capacity.
Bortezomib has been found to exert a direct inhibitory effect on the differentiation and activity of osteoclast
precursors because of inhibition of NF-jB and p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.30-32 In addition, nuclear factor of activated T cells and TRAF6 have
been identified as targets of bortezomib in the inhibition
of osteoclast maturation and function.33,34 Preclinical
experiments have also suggested that bortezomib has a
direct stimulatory effect on osteoblast development, both
increasing the number of osteoblasts and stimulating their
619

Review Article

differentiation.35-37 The inhibitory activity of bortezomib
on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is suggested to be
of central importance in explaining the effect of bortezomib on osteoblast development.28,32,35 For example, the
induction of osteoblast differentiation was found to be
due to bortezomib significantly increasing the activity of
the osteoblast transcription factor Runx2=Cbfa1 in
human osteoblast progenitors.35,36 Furthermore, bortezomib treatment has been found to result in an increase in
Osterix RNA and in enhanced activity of bone morphogenetic protein-2.38 In addition, the stimulatory effect of
bortezomib on bone formation was found to be due to its
inhibition of DKK-1 expression.39,40
A recent report has suggested that bortezomib may
also stimulate osteogenic differentiation independently of
proteasome inhibition through an inhibitory effect on
fibroblast growth factor-2, which is found at high levels in
patients with MM, and which inhibits a transcriptional
coactivator that induces differentiation of mesenchymal
cells into osteoblasts.41 With regard to second-generation
proteasome inhibitors, preclinical data have also suggested
an effect on bone disease. Indeed, a recent study by Hurchla
et al42 demonstrated that carfilzomib and its orally available
analog oprozomib directly inhibited osteoclast formation
and bone resorption in vitro, while enhancing osteogenic
differentiation and matrix mineralization. Furthermore, in
a mouse model, carfilzomib and oprozomib were found to
decrease bone resorption and enhance bone formation.
Taken together, these studies provided the rationale
for the investigation of bortezomib in patients with
myeloma-associated bone disease.
Bortezomib and Myeloma-Associated Bone
Disease: Clinical Data

In the human setting, initial clinical evidence to suggest
that bortezomib may play a role in promoting osteoblastic
bone formation was obtained in the phase 3 APEX trial, in
which Zangari et al observed a significant increase in serum
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels indicative of an increase
in osteoblast activity in a patient who responded to treatment with bortezomib.43 This increase in ALP was due to
bortezomib increasing the levels of bone-specific ALP
(bALP), indicating a direct and specific effect on osteoblastic activity. In contrast, no increases in ALP levels were
observed in patients responding to dexamethasone treatment, suggesting that the increase in ALP as a result of bortezomib treatment is not due to an antimyeloma effect
alone. Increases in bALP as well as osteocalcin (OC) levels
after treatment with bortezomib have since been observed
in several clinical studies investigating the drug as a single
620

agent or in combination.35,44-46 In addition, clinical studies
have shown that bortezomib effectively reduces levels of
DKK-1.45,46 In some of the reports, the increase in osteoblast number and activity was restricted to responders,35,47
whereas in others, both responders and nonresponders
demonstrated signs of increased osteoblast activity, thereby
supporting the hypothesis that a direct stimulatory effect
on the bone formation process may occur during treatment
with bortezomib.44,45,48 In addition, the inhibitory effect
of bortezomib on osteoclasts observed in the preclinical setting has been confirmed in clinical studies. Bortezomib
treatment was shown to result in a significant reduction in
RANKL levels, with concomitant reductions in osteoclast
function and bone resorption, as assessed by the following
markers of bone resorption: C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase isoform-5b
(TRACP-5b), and urinary N-telopeptide.45,46,48,49
To the best of our knowledge, Terpos et al were the
first to demonstrate a reduction in DKK-1 and RANKL
serum levels as a result of treatment with bortezomib,
leading to the normalization of bone remodeling.45
Patients with recurrent MM were treated with bortezomib
either as monotherapy or in combination with dexamethasone. Treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the
levels of DKK-1, sRANKL, CTX, and TRACP-5b after 4
cycles, a reduction that was maintained after 8 cycles
(Table 1). In addition, marked increases in bALP and OC
levels were noted. Although the increase in bALP was
greatest in patients who achieved complete remission
(CR) or very good partial remission (VGPR) after 4 cycles
of bortezomib, bALP was also found to be elevated over
baseline in patients who did not achieve at least a VGPR
as well as in 3 of 4 nonresponders. For the other bone
markers (OC, DKK-1, sRANKL, CTX, and TRACP-5b)
no correlation with response was observed, suggesting
that the effect of bortezomib on bone occurs irrespective
of treatment response.
In several recent studies, bortezomib treatment was
found to result in increases in bone mineral density
(BMD) and bone matrix deposition.50-53 Notably, bone
healing has been observed in a small number of cases.51,53
Terpos et al studied the effect of treating patients with
MM at the time of first recurrence with bortezomib plus
dexamethasone and zoledronic acid on BMD using dualenergy x-ray absorptiometry.50 After 8 cycles of therapy, a
significant increase in BMD was observed in the lumbar
spine, but not in the femoral neck. The investigators
noted that the increase in BMD was noted soon after the
initiation of treatment (within approximately 6 months).
In addition, urinary N-telopeptide levels were found to be

significantly reduced, whereas levels of bALP and OC
were markedly increased over baseline levels.
In a recent case report, the effect of bortezomib on myeloma bone lesions was assessed using technetium-99m
(99mTc)-methyl-diphosphonate bone scans in 2 patients.54
An increased uptake of the radiopharmaceutical by osteoblasts is associated with rebuilding activity. After 3 cycles of
bortezomib monotherapy in a patient with recurrent disease
and combination therapy with bortezomib, doxorubicin,
and dexamethasone in a patient with newly diagnosed disease, bone scan images revealed markedly increased osteoblastic function as indicated by increased isotope uptake,
which may suggest improvements in lesions. However, these
results require confirmation in larger series and using other
imaging techniques, such as x-ray or computed tomography
(CT) scans. In another prospective study, Zangari et al investigated the effect of single-agent bortezomib on bone structure in patients with recurrent or refractory disease using
micro-CT scans, tetracycline labeling, and morphometric
analysis.52 Treatment with bortezomib was shown to induce
significant increases in osteoblast activity; moreover, it also
resulted in increases in bone architectural parameters in
responding patients. In responders, a rapid increase in serum
parathormone levels was found to precede the osteoblastic
response, suggesting that the rise in parathormone levels
may trigger osteoblastic activation and bone anabolism. The
authors concluded that the results of their study indicate a
central role of proteasome function in bone metabolic disorders in addition to the treatment of MM.
In another prospective study, Lund et al treated
patients with newly diagnosed MM who had not received
any prior bisphosphonate therapy with bortezomib, iniCancer

tially as monotherapy and subsequently in combination
with glucocorticoids.51 Not only did the treatment yield
an increase in osteoblast activity, but it also led to
enhanced bone matrix deposition in responding patients,
as witnessed by a significant increase in the novel bone
marker procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (PINP).
PINP is released as collagen is deposited and becomes insoluble during the formation of the organic bone matrix
and may therefore serve as a marker for ongoing bone formation. Both bALP and PINP were found to be increased
after only 1 week of treatment. Furthermore, CT scans
revealed signs of bone healing in 2 cases at only 3 months
after the initiation of therapy. It is interesting to note that
it was also found that the increase in PINP was inhibited
by the addition of glucocorticoids. The investigators suggest that the observation of an inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids on bortezomib-induced bone formation may
have implications for treatment strategies involving the
combination of bortezomib and glucocorticoids. It may
indicate that after initial use in combination, glucocorticoids should be discontinued to maximize the positive
effect of bortezomib on bone.
Finally, Delforge et al conducted a post hoc analysis
of the phase 3 VISTA trial to examine clinical bone disease events during treatment.53 In the trial, patients with
previously untreated myeloma who were not eligible for
transplantation were randomized to receive either bortezomib plus the combination of melphalan and prednisone
(VMP) or MP alone. The analysis revealed that treatment
with VMP was associated with lower rates of bisphosphonate use during treatment, a lower rate of disease progression due to worsening bone disease, and a lower
621

Review Article

requirement for subsequent radiotherapy compared with
MP. Importantly, analysis of prebaseline and postbaseline
radiologic data, which were available at the data cutoff for
11 patients receiving VMP, revealed evidence of bone
healing in 6 of these patients, with the following myeloma
responses: 3 CRs, 1 PR, and 2 cases of stable disease. For
the 3 patients achieving a CR, an analysis of CT or x-ray
images demonstrated the improvement or resolution of
lesions. In contrast, no evidence of bone healing was
observed on the MP arm, even in those patients with similar responses to treatment. Another important finding is
the reduction in DKK-1 from baseline to day 4 with
VMP treatment, whereas an increase in DKK-1 levels was
observed when MP therapy was administered. The rapid
effect of a single dose of bortezomib on DKK-1 levels suggests that an early reduction of DKK-1 may be an important first step in the subsequent changes in bone
remodeling brought about by bortezomib. The investigators concluded that despite the post hoc nature of the
analysis, it provides important data regarding the effect of
bortezomib on bone disease in a large patient group.
Conclusions and Future Directions

Taken together, the findings discussed above suggest that
bortezomib may combine potent antimyeloma activity
with significant effects on bone. Studies are currently
ongoing to further examine the effect of bortezomib on
bone metabolism and how the beneficial effect may be used
in the clinic. Thus, two phase 2 studies evaluated the effect
of bortezomib on BMD using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (NCT01286077 and NCT00972959; www.
clinicaltrial.gov), whereas another study used ALP to evaluate osteoblast activation induced by bortezomib
(NCT01062230; www.clinicaltrial.gov). The expected
results will most likely influence current treatment guidelines. Indeed, open questions remain, such as whether the
agent should be used as monotherapy or in combination,
whether the beneficial effect is similar in both the frontline
and disease recurrence settings, and how the administration
of concomitant bisphosphonates should be managed. In
addition, it is of interest to investigate whether the positive
effects on bone may also exist in other malignancies.
