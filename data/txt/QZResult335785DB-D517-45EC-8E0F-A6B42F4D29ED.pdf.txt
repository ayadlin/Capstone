ABSTRACT:
Some retinoic acid metabolism blocking agents (RAMBAs) are known to exhibit
a wide range of anticancer activities by mechanisms that are still not completely
resolved. This study investigated the anticancer efficacy and mechanism(s) of
novel RAMBA retinamides (RRs) in triple negative and Her-2 overexpressing
breast cancer cells. Specifically, we examined the possibility that RRs affect the
translational machinery in these breast cancer (BC) cells. Recent findings suggest
that overexpression of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) in breast
cancers critically augments CAP-dependent mRNA translation and synthesis of
proteins involved in cell growth, cell proliferation, invasion and apoptosis evasion.
The oncogenic potential of eIF4E is strictly dependent on serine209 phosphorylation
by upstream MAPK-interacting kinases (Mnks). Targeting Mnk/eIF4E pathway for
blocking Mnk function and eIF4E phosphorylation is therefore a novel approach
for treating BCs, particularly for Her2-positive and triple negative breast cancers
that have no indications for endocrine therapy or effective treatment regimes. We
report for the first time that the degradation of Mnk1 by RRs in BC cells blocks eIF4E
phosphorylation and subsequently inhibits cell growth, colonization, invasion, and
migration and induce apoptosis. Most importantly, the anticancer efficacy of RRs
was mediated via degrading Mnk rather than inhibiting its kinase activity like Mnk
inhibitors (cercosporamide and CGP57380). Furthermore, RRs potencies on peIF4E
down-regulation and growth inhibition were superior to those of two clinically relevant
retinoids and the Mnk inhibitors. Together our findings provide the first preclinical
proof-of-concept of novel Mnk degrading agents for Mnk/eIF4E based therapeutic
treatment of breast cancers.

INTRODUCTION

progesterone receptors (PR). Selective amplification and/
or overexpression of human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (Her2) is found in approximately 25–30%
of all primary breast cancers. Her2 plays a critical role
in regulating cell proliferation, adhesion, motility, and
survival, and Her2 overexpression results in aggressive
tumor behavior, clinical resistance and poor prognosis [2].
In addition, 20–30% of breast cancers are triple-negative

Despite significant advances toward targeted
therapy and screening techniques, breast cancer remains
the most frequently diagnosed female malignancy and
leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide [1].
Approximately 60–70% of breast cancers are hormone
receptor positive expressing estrogen (ER) and/or

breast cancers (TNBC), lacking ER, PR and Her2 with
more aggressive clinical course than other forms of breast
cancer, increased local/systemic relapse and poor survival
[2-4]. Identifying novel molecular drug targets for TNBCs
that have no indications for endocrine therapy, and more
efficacious therapy for Her2-positive breast cancer has
therefore become extremely imperative in developing
effective treatment strategies for breast cancer patients.
Several breast cancer studies have identified numerous
genes such as p53, PIK3CA, AKT1, PTEN, and EGFR
to be commonly mutated in breast cancers. Activating
mutations in these genes promote aberrant activation of
certain signaling cascades and in turn tumor growth via
up-regulation of key oncogenic proteins [2].
Recent progress in molecular pathogenesis of
cancer has identified eukaryotic translation initiation
factor 4E (eIF4E), an oncogenic rate-limiting factor
of cap-dependent translation to play a critical role
in the translation of certain weak mRNAs such as
cyclin D1, Bcl-2, MMPs and VEGF that are vital for
oncogenic transformation [5-9]. eIF4E, regulated by
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/Mnk and
phosphoinositide 3-kinase-protein kinase B-mammalian
target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) signaling pathways
facilitates efficient initiation of mRNA translation by
binding to the 5′-cap structure of eukaryotic mRNAs [10,
11]. Studies with eIF4E expressing transgenic mice have
revealed a marked increase in the incidence of various
cancers including lymphomas, lung adenocarcinomas,
angiosarcomas, and hepatomas [12]. An association
between increased eIF4E expression and cellular
transformation is also seen in several tumors including that
of the breast, bladder, colon, head and neck, lymphoma,
lung, and thyroid [13]. Increased levels of eIF4E and
activated translation initiation are also considered crucial
for breast cancer progression and angiogenesis [14]. eIF4E
overexpression is further regarded as a poor prognostic
marker for breast cancer [13, 15-18]. Several approaches
for impeding eIF4E dependent translation initiation
have been conceived in recent years including the use
of eIF4E targeted antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), antiviral guanosine analogues, small molecule inhibitors and
natural phytochemicals such as curcumin and silibinin [1922]. These data collectively suggest that targeting MAPK/
Mnk signaling and blocking eIF4E protein translational
machinery to be a promising strategy for treating TNBCs
and other breast cancers [17, 23].
Recently, a family of retinoic acid metabolism
blocking agents (RAMBAs) described by us that chiefly
inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for the
metabolism of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) was show
to exert potent anticancer and growth inhibitory effects
in human breast/prostate cancer cells and breast/prostate
cancer xenograft models [24-30]. Several novel potent
RAMBAs that are structural analogues of ATRA and
4-hydroxyphenyl retinamide (4-HPR or fenretinide) have
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

been designed and synthesized in our laboratory [27,
28]. Previous studies have shown that these RAMBAs
inhibit cell proliferation and induce intrinsic apoptosis
by decreasing cyclin D1 and up-regulating pro-apoptotic
proteins [24, 25, 28, 30, 31]. Of particular interest is that
among the proteins regulated by translation initiator,
eIF4E, a number of them, such as cyclin D1, Bax, Bad
and Bcl-2 are also modulated by our RAMBAs [24, 30].
Recent studies have suggested that activation of eIF4E
is particularly important for the translation of a subset of
cancer promoting mRNAs including cyclin D1 and antiapoptotic proteins [8, 19, 32]. These observations led us to
postulate that RAMBA retinamides (RRs) could mediate
their inhibitory anticancer effects in part by modulating
the eIF4E translational machinery.
This study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of
RRs on growth inhibition, MAPK/Mnk mediated eIF4E
protein translational machinery and downstream biological
effects in triple negative and Her2 overexpressing
breast cancer cells. Our data demonstrate that RRs are
capable of degrading Mnk proteins, blocking eIF4E
phosphorylation, modulating cell cycle proteins thereby
inhibiting cell proliferation and survival, reducing colony
formation, inducing intrinsic apoptosis and impeding
tumor invasion and migration in breast cancer cells. The
present study therefore authenticates a novel function for
RRs in degrading Mnk and blocking eIF4E dependent
translational initiation, and further endorses the notion
that RRs are novel potential therapeutic agents for treating
triple negative and Her2 overexpressing breast cancers.

RESULTS
RRs inhibit cell proliferation and colony
formation of aggressive human breast cancer cells
We first investigated the effect of novel RRs
[VN/14-1 (parent RRs), VN/66-1, VNLG-145, -146,
-147, -148, -152, -153] and Mnk inhibitors (CGP57380
and cercosporamide) on the growth and proliferation of
triple negative (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) and
Her-2 overexpressing (SKBR-3) breast cancer cells by
MTT and colony formation assays. MTT results revealed
that RRs, in particular VNLG-147,-152 and -153 potently
inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468
cells with GI50 values ≤ 2 µmol/L and SKBR-3 cells with
GI50 values ≤ 4 µmol/L (Table 1). Identical results were
also obtained in ERα positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells
for the lead compound (VNLG-147, -152 and -153).
The GI50 values for these compounds are ≤ 2 µmol/L
(Supplementary Fig. 1A). The GI50 values (1.28 – 3.54
µmol/L) of most potent RRs were more potent that the
GI50 values (26.02 – 96.45 µmol/L) of the Mnk inhibitors.
Lead RR (VNLG-152) was also found to significantly

reduce MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 colony size and
number. Other RRs, ATRA, 4-HPR and Mnk inhibitors not
only displayed reduced potency in inhibiting cell viability
but also did not have any profound effects in inhibiting
colony formation (Table 1, Fig. 1A, B and C). Importantly,
immortalized non-cancerous MCF10A breast cell line
was less sensitive to lead RR, VNLG-152 than the other
cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 1B). Besides no
significant reduction in MCF10A colony size and number
was observed upon VNLG-152 treatment (Supplementary
Fig. 1C and D).
To gain further insight into the mechanism by which
RRs induces cell growth inhibition, we studied the effect
of RRs on cell cycle regulatory proteins (cyclins D1
and D3) in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. We
found that 24 h treatment of RRs resulted in a marked
decrease in the expression of both cyclin D1 and cyclin

D3 (Fig. 1D). To understand how VNLG-152 inhibits
cell proliferation by downregulating cyclins, cell cycle
analysis was performed. As seen in Fig. 1E, treatment with
VNLG-152 (2 µM) up to 72 h induced a time dependent
cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 and S phase in MDA-MB-231
cells. The concentration of VNLG-152 required to induce
cell cycle arrest is consistent with the GI50 value of
VNLG-152 required to reduce TNBC cell viability (Table
1). The G0/G1 and S phase arrest induced by VNLG-152
was associated with downregulation of cyclins D1, D3,
B1 and CDC25C that are involved in G0/G1 and S phase
transition. Furthermore expression of CDK2 and CDK4
were slightly downregulated and p21, a CDK inhibitor
was slightly upregulated (Figure 1F). The down-regulatory
effects of RRs on cyclins are consistent with our earlier
reports on cyclin D1 down-regulation by RAMBAs [24,
30].

RRs induce apoptosis to inhibit breast cancer cell
growth

(Table 1). To further assess whether VNLG-152 induced
apoptotic cell death is dependent upon caspases, we cotreated TNBC cells with VNLG-152 and the caspase
inhibitor ZVAD (5 µM, 72 h). Our results demonstrated
that combined treatment of ZVAD completely suppressed
VNLG-152 induced oligonucleosomal fragmentation,
thereby confirming that VNLG-152 induced apoptosis via
the caspase-dependent pathway (Fig. 2E). Co-treatment of
VNLG-152 and ZVAD also completely blocked VNLG152 induced PARP cleavage, a distinct feature of apoptosis
in TNBC cells (Fig. 2F).

To further determine whether the observed decrease
in cell numbers was due to induction of cell death, we
evaluated the apoptosis inducing potential of lead RRs in
TNBC cells by acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/
EB) dual staining and cell death detection ELISA assay
(Roche Diagnostics). AO/EB dual staining established
that VNLG-152 (10 µM, 72 h) exhibit strong proapoptotic effects compared to that of other RRs and
ATRA or 4-HPR (10 µM, 72 h) (Fig 2A). The apoptosis
inducing potential of the lead RRs was also confirmed
by cell death detection ELISA assay (Fig. 2B and C). In
both the TNBC cells, VNLG-152 significantly induced
apoptosis at concentration starting with 2 µM (Fig 2D).
This concentration is consistent with the GI50 value
of VNLG-152 required to reduce TNBC cell viability

RRs exerts strong anti-migratory and antiinvasive effects in breast cancer cells
Invasion is an imperative step in breast cancer cell
metastasis [37]. We therefore next evaluated the effects
of RRs on the anti-migratory and anti-invasive potential

of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells using woundhealing, PET membrane migration and matrigel invasion
assays. We found that 24h after well monolayers were
wounded, control cells completely filled the scratched
area. Treatment with VNLG-152 (2.5 μmol/L) potentially
inhibited cell migration (Fig. 3A and B). To determine the
possible involvement of Mnk/eIF4E signaling pathways
in the migration and invasion of TNBC cells, Mnk
inhibitors (CGP 57380 and cercosporamide; 10 µmol/L
each) were also used. Our results indicated that treatment
of TNBC cells with Mnk inhibitors also inhibited cell
migration, albeit significantly less effective than VNLG152 (compared effect of 2.5 µmol/L of VNLG-152 versus
Mnk inhibitors at 10 µmol/L; Fig. 3A and B). This data
signifies the involvement of Mnk/eIF4E signaling pathway
in TNBC cells migration. The inhibitory effect of VNLG152 on cell migration and invasion was further confirmed
by the PET membrane method (Supplementary Fig. 2) and
matrigel invasion assay (Fig. 3C and D).
Recent reports have indicated Mnk-mediated eIF4E
phosphorylation on serine 209 to be chiefly responsible

for cellular transformation in many tumors including that
of breast cancers. Mnk/eIF4E pathway is also reported
to be indispensable for cellular proliferation, invasion
and apoptosis evasion [10, 13]. To further support the
involvement of Mnk in downstream oncogenic event of
cell proliferation, we evaluated the expression of Mnk1,
peIF4E and cell cycle regulatory proteins in BC cells
upon treatment with siRNA sequence of Mnk1. We found
that addition of Mnk1 siRNA not only resulted in strong
knockdown of Mnk1, but also a significant decrease in the
expression of downstream cell cycle regulatory proteins
(Supplementary Fig. 3). Since the present study has
demonstrated that RRs (VNLG-152) strongly inhibit cell
proliferation, apoptosis evasion, invasion and migration in
BC cells by modulating several proteins including that of
cyclin D1 (Fig. 1D), and Bcl-2 (supplementary Fig. 4) that
are predominantly regulated by the Mnk/eIF4E pathway,
we hypothesized that RRs might disrupt these downstream
oncogenic events primarily by inhibiting Mnk/eIF4E
pathway. We therefore set forth to evaluate the effects of
RRs on Mnk and eIF4E protein translational machinery.

Inhibition of Mnk by RRs block eIF4E
phosphorylation in breast cancer cells

preclinical studies by researchers at Lilly in view of
clinical trials [33]. In addition to Mnk1, Mnk2 also
phosphorylates the cap binding eIF4E at ser209, albeit
to a lesser extent. We next performed a dose dependent
analysis to determine the optimum concentration for the
lead compound (VNLG-152) to induce Mnk degradation
and inhibit eIF4E phosphorylation. We found that in both
MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines, VNLG-152
exerted a dose dependent Mnk inhibition with maximal
effect at 20 µmol/L (Fig. 4D, E and F). To further confirm
whether the ability of VNLG-152 to reduce cell viability
in TNBC cells at 2 µM (GI50) was due to downregulation
of Mnks, we next performed a time dependent analysis by
treating TNBC cells with VNLG-152 (2 µM) up to 72 h.
As shown in supplementary Fig.5, treatment with VNLG152 induced a time dependent downregulation of both
Mnks and p-eIF4E signifying that MnK downregulation
contributed to the antiproliferative effects of VNLG-152
in TNBC cells.
To further explore the effect of RRs on the upstream
Mnk kinases, we examined the expression of p-Erk and

To first check if RRs had the ability to target Mnks
and peIF4E proteins, we probed the effect of RRs in
comparison with ATRA, 4-HPR and the Mnk inhibitorsCGP57380 and cercosporamide on the expression of
Mnk1 and p-eIF4Eser209 in BC cells by western blotting.
We observed that 24 h treatment of well-established
BC cells (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and SKBR3) with 15 µM of RRs reduced the expression of Mnk1
as well as phosphorylated eIF4E. However, no notable
effect was observed in the expression of total eIF4E
upon RRs treatment. Among the RRs tested, VNLG-152
exhibited highest degree of potency in down regulating
both Mnk1 and p-eIF4E (Fig. 4A, B and C). RRs also
showed robust down-regulation of Mnk1 and p-eIF4E
than the clinically relevant retinoids (ATRA and 4-HPR),
and Mnk inhibitors (CGP57380 and cercosporamide).
We note that cercosporamide is currently in advancing

p-p38 by western blotting. Our results indicated that (15
µM, 24 h) treatment of BC cells with RRs did not induce
any significant change in the expression levels of either
p-Erk or p-p38, signifying that effect of RRs on eIF4E
phosphorylation are not mediated via the upstream kinases
of Mnk (supplementary Fig 6A and B). Alternatively,
RRs may act via the protein phosphatase 2A, (PP2A) an
enzyme chiefly responsible for dephosphorylating Mnk1
and eIF4E [38], to inhibit Mnk/eIF4E pathway. To address
this, we analyzed the effect of RRs on the expression of
PP2A in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. Our
results revealed that 24 h treatment of BC cells with 15
µmol/L of RRs did not induce any remarkable changes
in the expression of PP2A, indicating that RRs-mediated
inhibition of eIF4E phosphorylation was not the result of
depletion of PP2A (Supplementary Fig 6C and D). Recent
studies have suggested that inhibition of eIF4E translation
via rapamycin leads to an increase in p-Akt [39]. We
therefore evaluated the effects of RRs on the expression

of Akt and p-Akt another potential mediator of Mnk/eIF4E
pathway. We found that RRs treatment did not cause any
changes in the levels of Akt and p-Akt proteins in all 3
breast cancer cell lines (Supplementary Figure 7).

Inhibition of Mnk/eIF4E pathway by RRs is
independent of in vitro Mnk kinase activity
Because RRs cause a significant reduction in
the expression of Mnk1, we further screened RRs in
comparison with staurosporine, a broad spectrum kinase
inhibitor for in vitro Mnk1/2 kinase profiling assay
to determine whether the RRs inhibit Mnk1/2 kinase
activities (studies conducted by CRO) [40]. We found that
although the reference compound, staurosporine inhibited
both Mnk1/2 activities, RRs did not have any inhibitory
effects on either Mnk1 or 2 in the range of 0.1 nmol/L
-10 µmol/L (supplementary Table 1). These findings

eIF4E activation and inhibition by RAMBA retinamides (VNLG-152). MDA-MB-231 (A) and MDA-MB-468 (B) cells were

treated with 20 µmol/L of VNLG-152, 5 μmol/L of MG-132, and combinations for 24 h. Mnk protein was immunoprecipitated with Mnk
antibody (mouse) and the precipitated protein was subjected to western blot analysis with anti-ubiquitin antibody (Ub) (C, upper panel).
The same blot was used to detect Mnk protein with anti-Mnk (rabbit) antibody after stripping (C, lower panel). Knockdown of Mnk1 by
transfection with siRNA against (Mnk1) or its scramble control blocks eIF4E phosphorylation in MDA-MB-231 (A) and MDA-MB-468
(B) cells. All blots were reprobed with β-actin for equal protein loading and transfer. The data are representatives of two independent
experiments. D: Activation of Ras/Erk pathway or p38 MAPK downstream of cytokine or stress stimuli results in activation of Mnk1
via phosphorylation. Activated Mnk subsequently binds to eIF4G and phosphorylates eIF4E within the eIF4F complex, resulting in the
translation of certain mRNAs vital for oncogenic transformation. Conversely, PP2A can directly dephosphorylate Mnk and eIF4E proteins,
leading to increased association of eIF4E with 4E-BP1 protein and reduced eIF4E translational machinery. RAMBA retinamides exert their
inhibitory mode of action by inducing Mnk1 degradation subsequently reducing eIF4E phosphorylation and eIF4E driven cap dependent
mRNA translation.

suggest that RRs do not have any considerable effects in
inhibiting Mnk kinase activity in vitro but rather cause its
degradation to mediate the inhibitory effect.

breast cancer retrospective and prospective studies
[17]. Phosphorylation of eIF4E at ser209 that occurs in
response to various extracellular stimuli such as growth
factors, hormones, and mitogens increases the affinity of
eIF4E for the 5’ cap of mRNA and influences its entry
into translation initiation complex. The best candidate
for eIF4E phosphorylation is the mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK)-activated protein kinase Mnk1.
Mnk1 physically associates with eIF4F and directly
phosphorylates eIF4E. In addition to Mnk1, Mnk2 is
also recognized to phosphorylate eIF4E but to a lesser
extent. Both Mnk1 and 2, particularly Mnk1, undergo
activation via phosphorylation by extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) or p38 mitogen-activated protein
(MAP) kinases. Mnk mediated eIF4E phosphorylation
favors mRNA translation of proteins involved in cell
proliferation and survival, and correlates with cancer cell
proliferation [10, 11, 41]. Wendel et al. have also shown
that the oncogenic potential of eIF4E is strictly dependent
on Mnk mediated ser209 phosphorylation in a mouse
lymphoma model [32]. In a recent study, the antifungal
agent, cercosporamide was reported to inhibit Mnk and
block phosphorylation of eIF4E both in vitro and in vivo
[33]. While Mnk function and eIF4E phosphorylation are
considered indispensable for malignant transformation,
Ueda et al., demonstrated that Mnk mediated eIF4E
phosphorylation are not essential for normal organismal
development [42]. Thus, targeting Mnk/eIF4E pathway
that is critical for cancer cell growth, survival and
tumor progression is an ideal and attractive strategy for
therapeutic intervention of breast cancers.
In this study, we have identified potential
therapeutic agents that prevent Mnk-dependent
phosphorylation of eIF4E in different breast cancer cell
subtypes including TNBC for which targeted therapies
are currently not available. The biological significance of
this phenomenon is indicated by enhanced cell death and
inhibition of cell growth, migration and invasion in RRs
(VNLG-152) treated cells where eIF4E phosphorylation
is prevented by Mnk1 degradation. We report here that
RRs significantly induce Mnk1 degradation that results
in the loss of Mnk1’s ability to phosphorylate eIF4E at
ser209 without affecting total eIF4E levels. These results
are consistent with the recent findings by Konicek et
al., on Mnk inhibition and eIF4E phosphorylation to
inhibit tumor growth and induce cell death in vitro and
in vivo [33]. Importantly, we note that RRs display more
potent activity in depleting Mnk1 and peIF4E proteins
compared to the other clinically relevant retinoids
(ATRA and 4-HPR) and Mnk inhibitors (cercosporamide
and CGP57380). The ability of the RRs to induce Mnk
degradation and block eIF4E phosphorylation may further
block the eIF4E mediated cap dependent translation in
breast cancer cells. Conceptually, Mnk1 degradation
provides a potential mechanism for antagonizing nonkinase dependent Mnk1 functions.

Mechanism of RRs mediated Mnk1 degradation
and the importance of Mnk1 in eIF4E
phosphorylation
To determine whether the decrease in eIF4E
phosphorylation by RRs is dependent on Mnk, we
examined the effect of lead compound VNLG-152 in
combination with MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor in
MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231 cells. We found that
treatment of both these cell lines with 20 µmol/L of VNLG152 for 24 h degraded Mnk1 significantly compared to
that of control and MG-132 alone treated cells. In cells
that were co-treated with VNLG-152 (20 µmol/L, at 16
h) and MG-132 (5 µmol/L at 8 h), Mnk1 degradation was
rescued, thus confirming that VNLG-152 induces Mnk1
degradation to inhibit eIF4E phosphorylation (Fig. 5A
and B). VNLG-152 induced Mnk degradation was further
confirmed by polyubiquitination. The polyubiquitination
was detected by immunopecipitation of cell lysates with
Mnk1, followed by Western blot analyses with antiubiquitin antibody (Fig 5C).
To further support the role of Mnk1 in eIF4E
phosphorylation, we assessed the expression of Mnk1 and
peIF4E in BC cells upon treatment with siRNA sequence
of Mnk1. We found that addition of Mnk1 siRNA
resulted in robust knockdown of Mnk1 and a decrease
in the expression of downstream peIF4E protein. siRNA
mediated Mnk1 reduction also resulted in a proportionate
decrease in the amount peIF4E protein that matched the
decrease achieved by VNLG-152 on Mnk1 and pIF4E
proteins confirming that the mechanism underlying
VNLG-152 inhibitory effect on Mnk/peIF4e pathway
involved Mnk degradation (Fig 5A and B).

DISCUSSION
Majority of breast cancer related deaths are typically
due to late diagnosis and resistance to therapies which
result in rapid progression and metastatic spreading. In
this study we have used in vitro breast cancer models
to examine the anti-cancer effects of RRs and further
our hypothesis that RRs mediated anti-cancer effects
are in part mediated via inhibition of cap dependent
mRNA translation. Our results demonstrate that in Her2
overexpressing and TNBC cells, RRs, especially, VNLG152 disrupt translation machinery resulting in inhibition
of protein translation and downstream oncogenic events.
Several studies in recent years have identified the
oncoprotein eIF4E and its phosphorylated forms to be
overexpressed in breast carcinomas [13, 17]. eIF4E is
also identified as a poor prognostic marker in several

	 Mnk degradation and eIF4E phosphorylation
are the foremost focus of this study as eIF4E is the
utmost substrate of Mnk, particularly with respect
to malignancy [23, 41]. Mnk activation is usually a
downstream consequence of ERK and/or p38MAPK
activating kinases. Besides these upstream kinases, Mnk
and eIF4E may also be regulated by protein phosphatase
2 (PP2A) via dephosphorylation [23, 38, 41]. Our results
indicate that RRs do not have any significant effects on
ERK/p38MAPK, Akt or PP2A, and that RRs mediated
Mnk downregulation apparently involves ubiquitin
dependent degradation that was confirmed with studies
using proteasomal inhibitor MG-132. We also found
that breast cancer cells that were treated discretely with
Mnk1 siRNA and RRs resulted in a similar pattern of
results on Mnk1 and peIF4E expression, signifying
that RRs function in a manner similar to that of Mnk1
siRNA that mediate Mnk1 knockdown. Unlike most
regulatory mechanisms, protein degradation is intrinsically
irreversible and RRs induced Mnk degradation can
result in a rapid, complete and sustained termination of
downstream eIF4E cap dependent translational process in
breast cancer cells which eventually results in inhibition
of cell growth, colony formation and tumor invasion
as well as induction of caspase dependent cell death.
Several studies have reported that the proteins cyclins
A, B, D, and E, CDK inhibitor p27, p21, transcription
factor E2F, retinoblastoma (Rb), and tumor suppressor
p53 are regulated by proteasome-mediated proteolysis.
The blockage of cell cycle progression with proteasome
inhibitors is currently used against various forms of cancer
[43]. Figure 5D represents the overall effects of RRs on
Mnk, eIF4E, upstream activating kinases and downstream
oncogenic events in breast cancer cells.
In conclusion, the data provided in this manuscript
show that RRs degrade Mnk1 and block eIF4E
phosphorylation to possibly promote cell death and
inhibit cell growth, survival and invasion in breast cancer
cells. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first preclinical proof of evidence for agents capable of inducing
Mnk1 degradation in cancer cells. Furthermore, we are
unaware of any reported small-molecule Mnk degrading
agents (MNKDAs) capable of inducing depletion of eIF4E
phosphorylation and translational machinery. Reports
from other laboratory have demonstrated that CGP57380
and cercosporamide block eIF4E phosphorylation by
inhibiting Mnk activity rather than degrading Mnk [33,
34]. Significantly, unlike the Mnk inhibitors (CGP57380
and cercosporamide) and two clinically relevant retinoids
(ATRA and 4-HPR) [35, 36], RRs show potent breast
cancer cell growth inhibition and down-regulation of
p-eIF4E. RRs mediated-Mnk1 degradation and inhibition
of eIF4E phosphorylation observed in the present study
is of significance considering the emerging attention in
control of mRNA translation in general and the potent
novel anticancer effects of Mnk degrading agents in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

particular. Our data support the notion that agents which
degrade Mnk and block eIF4E mediated downstream
events are likely to be superior to selective small molecule
Mnk inhibitors such as cercosporamide and CGP57380 in
the treatment of human cancers. Our data also highlight the
potential utility of these compounds in investigating Mnk
function compared to other commercially available Mnk
inhibitors. Based on the well-established pharmacologic
safety of the structurally related VN/66-1 synthesized
previously by us [29] and 4-HPR [35], we envision that
these new RRs will be nontoxic (safe) with excellent druglike properties.
Because RRs degrade Mnk1/2 in aggressive breast
cancer cells, a rational drug development strategy could
be used to further progress these compounds towards
advanced preclinical and clinical testing. Moreover,
reducing Mnk/p-eIF4E expression with novel RRs could
also provide a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of
additional aggressive cancers because Mnk1/2 and eIF4E/
p-eIF4E expressions are reported to be up-regulated
during progression of all types of solid tumors [9] and
hematologic cancers [44].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture treatment and Western blotting
MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were
purchased from ATCC and cultured in the recommended
media supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were plated
1 day prior to treatment. Mnk inhibitors (CGP5730 and
cercosporamide), clinically relevant retinoids (ATRA
and 4-HPR) were treated at 15 µmol/L and RAMBA
retinamides were treated at indicated concentration and
time periods and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Protein
lysates were harvested in RIPA lysis buffer (sigma).
Western blotting was done as described previously
[30] with the following antibodies: p-eIF4E, Mnk1/2,
total eIF4E, PP2A, p-p38, p-ERK, CDK2 and 4, cyclin
B1, cyclin D1 and D3, CDC25C, Bcl-2, β-actin (Cell
Signaling), mouse and rabbit horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology).

Cell growth and colony formation assays
Cell growth inhibition assay was performed as
described previously [28]. For cell growth experiment,
cells were treated with the RRs for 6 days. MTT assay
was performed at the end of the experiment. Calculations
of combination indices were done using the Calcusyn
program (Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom). For
colony formation assay, cells were plated 1000 per well
in complete media in six-well plates and allowed to

adhere for 24 h. The next day cells were treated with
(VN/14-1, ATRA, CGP57380, cercosporamide and
4-HPR) and RRs (10 μmol/L). After 24 h compound
containing media were removed, and cells were allowed
to form colonies in complete media. Approximately 2-3
weeks later the colonies were fixed, stained with 0.5%
crystal violet (sigma) for 30 min and counted manually.

were collected and incubated with 1 µg of polyclonal
antibody per 500 µg of total protein in immunoprecipitate.
Protein lysate-antibody complex were rotated for 12 h at 4
°
C and beads added for an additional 1 h. Complexes were
centrifuged in microcentrifuge at 4°C and the supernatant
was discarded. Beads were washed with 3X IP/lysis buffer
and were re-suspended in 2X SDS sample loading buffer
and boiled at 99 °C for 5 min. Samples were then separated
in SDS-PAGE and used for Western blot analysis using
ubiquitin antibodies after stripping of the membrane for
Mnk.

Cell cycle analysis

Small interfering RNA experiment

Cell cycle analysis was performed as described
previously [30, 31]. 0.3×106 cells were seeded in a 6-well
plate and treated for up to 72 h with VNLG-152 (2 µM).
Cells were stained with 40 mg/mL PI prior to analysis by
a FACS calibur instrument (Becton Dickinson, San Jose,
CA, USA) employing the Cell Quest Software.

For siRNA transfection, cells at a concentration of
2.5 or 5 x 104 cells/mL were incubated for 24 h in six-well
plates in culture medium. The cells were then transfected
with Mnk1 siRNA and non-targeting siRNA (purchased
from Ambion) for 72 h in the presence of oligofectamine
(Invitrogen). Protein silencing was further confirmed by
immunoblot analysis.

MNK kinase assay
In vitro profiling of the Mnk1 and Mnk2 kinase was
performed at Reaction Biology Corporation (Pennsylvania)
using the “HotSpot” assay platform. Concisely, specific
kinase/substrate pairs along with required cofactors were
prepared in reaction buffer; 20 mmol/L Hepes pH 7.5,
10 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 0.02% Brij35, 0.02
mg/ml BSA, 0.1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 2 mmol/L DTT, 1%
DMSO. 10 µmol/L concentrations of compounds were
disseminated into the reaction followed ~20 min later
by addition of a mixture of ATP (Sigma) and 33P ATP
(PerkinElmer. Reactions were carried out at 25 °C for 120
min, followed by spotting of the reactions onto P81 ion
exchange filter paper (Whatman). Unbound phosphate
was removed by extensive washing of filters in 0.75%
phosphoric acid. After subtraction of background derived
from control reactions containing inactive enzyme, kinase
activity data were expressed as the percent remaining
kinase activity in test samples compared to vehicle
(dimethyl sulfoxide) reactions.

Immunoprecipitation
and
ubiquitination of Mnk protein

detection

Cell apoptosis assay (acridine orange/ethidium
bromide (AO/EB) dual staining; and cell death
detection ELISA assay)
In each of this assay, cells were treated with
indicated concentrations of the compounds for 72 h.
Assessment of the apoptotic potential by Cell Death
Detection ELISA assay was done as per protocol of the
manufacturer (Roche diagnostics). For AO/EB dual
staining, acridine orange (0.1%) and ethidium bromide
(0.2%) in PBS were added to the cells and incubated at 37
°
C and 5% CO2 for 30 min. Cells were then immediately
analyzed using Nikon TE2000 fluorescence microscope.

Scratch motility (wound-healing) assay
The anti-migratory efficacy of RRs was examined
using the well-established wound healing assay [45].
MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were plated in a
24 well plate at 5 x 105 cells per well and allowed to form a
confluent monolayer for 24 h. Cells were made dormant by
pretreating with 0.5 µmol/L mitomycin C for 2 h to ensure
that wounds are filled due to cell migration and not by
cell proliferation [46]. Subsequently, the monolayer was
scratched with a pipette tip, washed with media to remove
floating cells, and photographed (time 0). Cells were then
treated in the presence or absence of 2.5 and 10 µmol/L
concentrations of indicated compounds. Experiment was
terminated as soon as wound was completely filled in
vehicle treated controls. Cells were then photographed
again using Nikon TE2000 microscope at three randomly
selected sites per well.

of

MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were
treated with VNLG-152 (20 µmol/L) and MG-132 (5
μmol/L) and combination thereof for 24 h. MG-132 was
added 8 h prior to the VNLG-152. Treated and control
cells were lysed with IP/lysis buffer (20 mmol/L Tris pH
= 7.4, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% triton X-100, 0.1% NP40, 1
mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L PMSF, 1X protease inhibitors
cocktail). 0.5 mg of total cell lysates were pre-cleared with
20 mL of protein A/G sepharose beads (Santa Cruz), for
45 min and pelleted for 1 min at 13,300 rpm. Supernatants

The migration assay was conducted using
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membrane (8-μm pore
size) tissue culture (TC) insert from Millipore. Briefly,
TNBC cells were plated into the upper chamber of the
TC insert containing serum free media, and the insert was
placed into a well of a 24 well plate containing various
compounds (10 μmol/L) including VNLG-152. The
control well contained serum free media only. After 24
h, the top surface of the non-migrated cells were scraped
with cotton swabs and the cells on the lower surface of
the membrane (migrated cells) were fixed for 15 min with
cold MeOH and stained with crystal violet. Cells that had
migrated to the bottom of the membrane were visualized
and counted using an inverted microscope. For each
replicate (n = 3), cells in four randomly selected fields
were counted and averaged.
