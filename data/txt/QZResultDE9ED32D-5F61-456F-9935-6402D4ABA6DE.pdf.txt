Abstract
ErbB2 (HER2, neu) is a receptor tyrosine kinase overexpressed in
about 25% of invasive breast carcinomas. Neutrophil gelatinase–
associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a secreted glycoprotein expressed in a variety of cancers, including breast carcinomas.
NGAL can inhibit erythroid cell production, leading to anemia.
Anemia usually occurs in cancer patients and negatively affects
quality of life. However, current treatment for cancer-related
anemia has potential complications. ErbB2, NGAL, and anemia
have all been associated with increased metastasis and poor
prognosis in breast cancer patients, although the relationship
between ErbB2 and NGAL expression is not clear. Here, using
breast cancer cell lines in vitro and transgenic mice carrying
the activated c-neu oncogene driven by a mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV-neu) in vivo, we show that ErbB2 overexpression leads to NGAL upregulation, which is dependent on
nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activity. MMTV-neu transgenic mice
developed anemia after tumor onset, and anemia progression
could be partially arrested by a NF-κB inhibitor and ErbB2-targeted therapy. Taken together, upregulation of NGAL by ErbB2
through NF-κB activation is involved in cancer-related anemia,
and the ErbB2, NF-κB, and NGAL pathways may serve as potential therapeutic targets for cancer-related anemia. [Cancer Res
2009;69(24):9163–8]

Introduction
ErbB2 overexpression has been correlated with poor prognosis
and increased incidence of metastasis in breast cancer patients
(1). Anemia commonly occurs in breast cancer patients and is
also associated with poor prognosis, in addition to having profound negative effect on patients' quality of life (2). Current
treatment for cancer-related anemia is blood transfusion or using erythropoiesis-stimulating agents; each has a potential risk of
severe complications (3). Blood transfusions can result in infectious disease transmission and transfusion-related reactions (3),
and recent phase III trials revealed that erythropoiesis-stimulating
agents increased the risk of developing venous thromboembolism
and decreased survival rates in anemic cancer patients (4). Therefore, it is necessary to develop new treatment modalities for cancer
patients with anemia.
Neutrophil gelatinase–associated lipocalin (NGAL; also known
as LCN2 or lipocalin 2) is a 25-kDa monomer capable of homodi-

merization and heterodimerization with neutrophil gelatinase (5).
NGAL, identified as a component of neutrophil granules, inhibits
bacterial growth by depleting their intracellular iron stores (6).
NGAL is also a promising biomarker of kidney injury that predicts
acute renal impairment (7). NGAL overexpression is found in a variety of cancers, including breast carcinomas (8), and is a predictor
of poor prognosis and increased risk of metastasis in breast cancer
patients (8). Additionally, NGAL was shown to induce apoptosis of
primary bone marrow cells, including erythroid progenitor cells,
and inhibit erythroid cell production leading to anemia (9–12).
ErbB2, NGAL, and anemia have all been associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. However, the association between
ErbB2 and NGAL is debatable (8, 13). We postulated that ErbB2
overexpression may upregulate NGAL and play a role in cancerrelated anemia. Indeed, we found that ErbB2 overexpression upregulates NGAL in a nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)–dependent manner.
Additionally, MMTV-neu transgenic mice developed anemia after
mammary tumor onset around a mean time of 24 weeks. Furthermore, NGAL expression and anemia progression could be partially
inhibited by blocking the NF-κB pathway or by ErbB2-targeted
therapy.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and antibodies. 231BR.vec, 231BR.erbB2, MCF7.vec, and
MCF7.erbB2 cells were described previously (14, 15). Antibodies used are
NGAL (HYB 211-01, Antibodyshop), NGAL (M-145, Santa Cruz), Neu (C-18,
Santa Cruz), β-actin (Sigma), phosphor-IκBα (Cell Signaling), and IκBα
(Cell Signaling). Immunoblotting was done as previously described (16).
Plasmids. The pGL3-NGAL-267 plasmid was obtained by PCR amplification of genomic DNA using forward primer 5′-CCACATACAGGGCAATCAGA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GATTTCAGGGCCGAGGAAG-3′. This PCR
fragment was ligated into pCR 2.1-TOPO II TA cloning vector (Invitrogen),
then cloned into pGL3-basic (Promega) using the HindIII and XhoI restriction enzymes. The pGL3-NGAL-267(−267 to +69) plasmid contains 336 bp
from the region upstream of the translational start site on the LCN2 gene.
All plasmids were sequenced across the multiple cloning sites of pGL3basic to verify sequence integrity. Truncated deletion promoter plasmids,
pGL3-NGAL-154(−154 to +69) and pGL3-NGAL-138(−138 to +69), were generated by PCR using pGL3-NGAL-267 as the template with the primers 5′CTCTGTCTTGCCCAATCCTG-3′ and 5′-CCTGACCAGGTGCAGAAATC-3′,
respecitively.
Conditioned media. Conditioned media were collected after the indicated breast cancer cells were cultured for 48 h in serum-free DMEM/F-12
to 80% to 90% confluency and concentrated using centrifugal filter units
(Millipore).
Drug treatments. Indicated cells were treated with 2 μg/mL trastuzumab (Genentech, Inc.) or human normal IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories, Inc.) for 6 h and with NF-κB inhibitor, Bay 11-7082 (Sigma),
for 4 h. Conditioned media were collected 48 h later and assayed as
indicated.

Luciferase assays. Luciferase assays were done as previously described
(17).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was done as previously described (17). Antibodies used were
IgG, histone H1, and NF-κB subunits p50 and p65 (all from Santa Cruz).
Coprecipitated DNA (2 μL) was analyzed by PCR (30–35 cycles) using specific primers, 5′-AAGGCACAGAGGGAGTCGTTGTCC-3′ and 5′-AAGAGGAGGTGGCGAGTGAGAGGC-3′, to the NF-κB binding region of the
NGAL promoter.
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was done as previously described (16).
Animal experiments. MMTV-neu transgenic mice were obtained from
Dr. William Muller (McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). MMTVpolyoma middle T antigen transgenic mice (PyMT) and FVB wild-type mice
were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Tail-vein blood (200 μL) from
mice was collected in microcontainers containing EDTA at the indicated
time. Whole blood was processed for complete blood cell (CBC) counts
by the Veterinary Laboratory Medicine Core Facility, Department of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. MMTV-neu mice were palpated for mammary tumors twice a
week. Bay 11-7082 (5 mg/kg) was dissolved in 0.5% methyl cellulose and
injected i.p. three times a week for 2 wk (200 μL/mouse). The same amount
of DMSO dissolved in 0.5% methyl cellulose was used as the control for Bay
11-7082. The monoclonal antibody (mAb) 7.16.4 (2 mg/kg) was injected i.p.
twice a week for 2 wk, and mouse IgG was used as a control. Protein extraction from mammary tumors was done as previously described (16).
Statistical analysis. Statistical differences were assessed with paired
t test, unpaired t test, or one-way ANOVA as indicated. P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Results
ErbB2 overexpression leads to increased NGAL expression
in vitro and in vivo. To determine if overexpression of ErbB2 induces NGAL expression, we compared NGAL protein levels in conditioned media from MDA-MB-231BR and MCF7 human breast
cancer cells stably overexpressing ErbB2 (231BR.erbB2 and

MCF7.erbB2) or vector controls (231BR.vec and MCF7.vec). We
found that ErbB2 high-expressing 231BR.erbB2 and MCF7.erbB2
cells secreted more NGAL than ErbB2 low-expressing vector control cells after serum starvation (Fig. 1A). To further investigate
whether ErbB2 overexpression induces NGAL, we compared the
NGAL expression in mammary tumors from MMTV-neu transgenic mice with that from MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice. Mammary
tumors from MMTV-neu mice had higher NGAL expression than
those from MMTV-PyMT mice (Fig. 1B), indicating ErbB2 overexpression induced NGAL expression.
To determine whether ErbB2 was required for NGAL upregulation, we treated 231BR.vec and 231BR.erbB2 cells with trastuzumab, an ErbB2 antibody, to inhibit ErbB2 signaling. Indeed,
trastuzumab treatment reduced NGAL production along with
ErbB2 downregulation in 231BR.erbB2 cells compared with the
IgG control (Fig. 1C). Next, we tested if downregulation of ErbB2
in MMTV-neu mice could lead to decreased NGAL expression.
When tumors became palpable, MMTV-neu mice were injected either with mAb 7.16.4 targeting the rat neu oncogene or with mouse
IgG. Similar to trastuzumab treatment of 231BR.erbB2 cells, mAb
7.16.4 treatment of tumor-bearing MMTV-neu mice led to ErbB2
downregulation and reduced NGAL expression compared with
IgG-treated controls (Fig. 1D). Together, these data indicate that
ErbB2 overexpression induces NGAL upregulation.
ErbB2 upregulates NGAL expression in a NF-κB–dependent
manner. To investigate the mechanism of ErbB2-mediated NGAL
upregulation, we examined NGAL mRNA levels in 231BR.vec and
231BR.erbB2 cells by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) after serum starvation. The 231BR.erbB2 cells had increased NGAL mRNA
levels compared with 231BR.vec cells (Fig. 2A). To determine
whether increased NGAL mRNA was due to transcriptional upregulation, we cloned the proximal region of NGAL promoter, known
to be involved in NGAL transcriptional regulation, into a luciferase
reporter (pGL3-NGAL-267; Fig. 2B). Relative luciferase activity was

in 231BR.vec cells, indicating NGAL upregulation at the transcriptional level (Fig. 2C, left). To further identify the critical promoter
region(s) for NGAL upregulation, we generated two NGAL promoter 5′ deletion constructs, pGL3-NGAL-154 and pGL3-NGAL-138.
231BR.erbB2 cells failed to induce NGAL promoter–driven luciferase activity when NGAL promoter is deleted to −154 (Fig. 2C, right),
indicating that the sequence between −267 and −154 is necessary
for ErbB2-mediated NGAL transcriptional upregulation. Among
the sequences between −267 and −154, the sequences between
−180 and −171 has a homology to the NF-κB binding-site consensus
sequence, 5′-GGG(A/G)NNT(C/T)CC-3′ (18). Indeed, chromatin
immunoprecipitation assay showed that NF-κB subunits p50 and

p65 bind to the NGAL promoter in 231BR.erbB2 cells after serum
starvation (Fig. 2D).
To further determine the contribution of NF-κB in ErbB2mediated NGAL upregulation, we treated 231BR.erbB2 cells with
Bay 11-7082, which inhibits IκBα degradation and blocks NF-κB
translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Bay 11-7082 treatment decreased NGAL levels in the conditioned media from 231BR.

(Fig. 3A and B). Furthermore, treatment of tumor-bearing MMTVneu mice with Bay 11-7082 reduced phospho-IκBα, NF-κB nuclear
localization, and NGAL expression in mammary tumors relative to
control-treated mice (Fig. 3C and D). These data indicate that NF-κB
signaling is important for ErbB2-mediated NGAL upregulation.

Cancer-related anemia can be partially rescued by blocking
the NF-κB pathway and by ErbB2-targeted therapy. To test if
anemia occurs in tumor-bearing MMTV-neu mice, we collected
blood from the tail veins and analyzed the CBC counts before
mammary tumor development at 16 wk of age and again when
mammary tumors were palpable at 24 wk. As controls, we also
counted CBC from the wild-type mice at 24 wk of age. After tumor
onset, MMTV-neu mice had significantly (P < 0.01) lower hemoglobin levels than did wild-type mice and MMTV-neu mice before their
tumors appeared (Fig. 4A). To investigate whether blocking the NFκB pathway can impede anemia progression in tumor-bearing
MMTV-neu mice and MMTV-PyMT mice, we treated mice i.p. with
Bay 11-7082 or placebo. CBC counts before and after treatment
showed that anemia progression could be partially reversed by
Bay 11-7082 treatment in MMTV-neu mice, but not in MMTVPyMT mice (Fig. 4B). Additionally, the ErbB2-targeted therapy with
mAb 7.16.4 also partially arrested the anemia progression in tumorbearing MMTV-neu mice (Fig. 4C).

Discussion
In this study, we found that ErbB2 induces NGAL expression
through NF-κB activation, which contributes to anemia in mice
with ErbB2/neu-overexpressing tumor; whereas a NF-κB inhibitor
and ErbB2-targeted therapy can decrease NGAL expression in
ErbB2/neu-overexpressing mammary tumor and partially reverse

anemia progression. Previous studies reported that NGAL can induce erythroid progenitor cell apoptosis, inhibit RBC production,
and lead to anemia (10–12). NF-κB is also responsible for impaired
erythropoietin synthesis, which contributes to the development of
cancer-related anemia (19). Our findings are consistent with previous reports; thus, we propose that both NGAL and NF-κB may play
critical roles in cancer-related anemia, especially in ErbB2/neuoverexpressing tumor-related anemia. Anemia negatively influences cancer patients' overall quality of life and worsens their
prognosis. Unfortunately, current treatment for cancer-related
anemia has limitations. Because NF-κB inhibitor is currently under
clinical trials (20) and ErbB2-targeted therapy (trastuzumab) is
routinely used for patients with ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancers (1), our data provide a rational base for using these targeted
therapies as potential new treatments for cancer-related anemia,
which could have an impact on breast cancer patient care. Meanwhile, further studies are necessary to elucidate the underlying
mechanism of NGAL and NF-κB in cancer-related anemia and identify better therapeutic targets, as the NF-κB inhibitor or ErbB2targeted therapy had partial efficacy in treating cancer-related anemia in MMTV-neu mice. In conclusion, our data provided evidence
that NF-κB plays a pivotal role in ErbB2-mediated NGAL upregulation and cancer-related anemia. This pathway may serve as a promising therapeutic target itself and provide insight for further
identification of other targets.
