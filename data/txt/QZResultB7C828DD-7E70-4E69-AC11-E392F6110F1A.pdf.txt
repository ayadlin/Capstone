Abstract
Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) is a promising cancer
chemopreventive agent but the mechanism of its anticancer
effect is not fully understood. We now show, for the first time,
that PEITC treatment triggers Atg5-dependent autophagic
and apoptotic cell death in human prostate cancer cells. Exposure of PC-3 (androgen independent, p53 null) and LNCaP
(androgen responsive, wild-type p53) human prostate cancer
cells to PEITC resulted in several specific features characteristic of autophagy, including appearance of membranous
vacuoles, formation of acidic vesicular organelles, and
cleavage and recruitment of microtubule-associated protein
1 light chain 3 (LC3) to autophagosomes. A normal human
prostate epithelial cell line (PrEC) was markedly more resistant toward PEITC-mediated cleavage and recruitment of
LC3 compared with prostate cancer cells. Although PEITC
treatment suppressed activating phosphorylations of Akt and
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which are implicated in regulation of autophagy by different stimuli, processing and recruitment of LC3 was only partially/marginally
reversed by ectopic expression of constitutively active Akt or
overexpression of mTOR-positive regulator Rheb. The PEITCmediated apoptotic DNA fragmentation was significantly
attenuated in the presence of a pharmacologic inhibitor of
autophagy (3-methyl adenine). Transient transfection of
LNCaP and PC-3 cells with Atg5-specific small interfering
RNA conferred significant protection against PEITC-mediated
autophagy as well as apoptotic DNA fragmentation. A
xenograft model using PC-3 cells and Caenorhabditis elegans
expressing a lgg-1:GFP fusion protein provided evidence for
occurrence of PEITC-induced autophagy in vivo. In conclusion, the present study indicates that Atg5 plays an important
role in regulation of PEITC-induced autophagic and apoptotic
cell death. [Cancer Res 2009;69(8):3704–12]

Introduction
Molecular basis for onset and progression of prostate cancer is
not fully understood (1), but this malignancy continues to be a
leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men in the United
States. Prostate cancer is usually diagnosed in the sixth and
seventh decades of life, providing a large window of opportunity for

intervention to prevent or slow disease progression. Therefore,
identification and preclinical/clinical development of novel agents
that are nontoxic but can delay onset and/or progression of human
prostate cancer is highly desirable. Epidemiologic studies have
indicated that dietary intake of cruciferous vegetables may lower
the risk of different types of malignancies, including cancer of the
prostate (2, 3). Anticarcinogenic effect of cruciferous vegetables is
attributed to organic isothiocyanates, which are released on processing (cutting or chewing) of these vegetables (4, 5). Phenethyl
isothiocyanate (PEITC) is one such naturally occurring isothiocyanate compound that has received increasing attention due to its
cancer chemopreventive effects. For example, PEITC is a potent
inhibitor of pulmonary tumorigenesis in rats induced by tobaccospecific carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (6). Prevention of chemical carcinogenesis by PEITC has also
been observed against diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocellular
adenomas in C3H mice and N-nitrosobenzylmethylamine–induced
esophageal cancer in rats (7, 8). Dietary N-acetylcysteine conjugate
of PEITC during the postinitiation phase inhibited benzo[a]pyreneinduced lung adenoma multiplicity in mice (9).
More recent studies have revealed that PEITC treatment
suppresses growth of prostate cancer cells in culture and in vivo
(10–16). The mechanism of antiproliferative effect of PEITC is not
fully understood but known cellular responses to this promising
natural product in cultured cancer cells include activation of c-Jun
NH2-terminal kinases and extracellular signal-regulated kinases,
activation of G2-M phase checkpoint, apoptosis induction, suppression of nuclear factor-nB–regulated gene expression, inhibition
of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling, repression of
androgen receptor expression, and inhibition of cap-dependent
translation (10–19). We have also shown previously that PEITC
treatment suppresses angiogenesis in vitro and ex vivo at pharmacologically relevant concentrations in association with inhibition of serine-threonine kinase Akt (20).
The Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling
pathway has assumed a central role in regulation of autophagy,
which is an evolutionarily conserved and dynamic process for bulk
degradation of cellular macromolecules and organelles (21–23).
Because PEITC treatment inhibits Akt activity in human prostate
cancer cells (17, 20), the present study was designed to address
the question of whether anticancer effect of PEITC is mediated
by autophagic cell death. We now show that PEITC treatment
causes Atg5-dependent autophagic as well as apoptotic cell death
in human prostate cancer cells.

PEITC Causes Atg5-Mediated Autophagy and Apoptosis
Transient transfection. PC-3 or LNCaP cells (1  105) were plated in
six-well plates, allowed to attach, and transiently transfected with pCMV6
vector encoding constitutively active Akt-1 (kindly provided by Dr. Daniel
Altschuler, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA), pcDNA3.1 vector
encoding Rheb, or corresponding empty vector using Fugene6 transfection
reagent. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were treated with
DMSO (control) or 5 Amol/L PEITC for 9 h. The cells were then processed
for immunofluorescence microscopy for LC3 or immunoblotting as
described above.
RNA interference of Atg5. PC-3 or LNCaP cells (105 in six-well plates)
were transfected at 30% to 50% confluency with either 100 nmol/L Atg5targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA; pool of three target-specific 20to 25-nucleotide siRNAs; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or a control nonspecific
siRNA (Qiagen). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were exposed
to 5 Amol/L PEITC or DMSO and the incubation was continued for an
additional 9 h. Cells were then collected and processed for immunoblotting
of Atg5, LC3, and caspase-3, analysis of cytoplasmic histone-associated
apoptotic DNA fragmentation, or immunofluorescence microscopy for
LC3 localization.
Xenograft study. Male nude mice (6–8 wk old) were divided into two
groups of five mice per group. The experimental mice were gavaged with
9 Amol PEITC in 0.1 mL PBS containing 0.1% DMSO five times per week,
whereas the control mice received 0.1 mL vehicle. Exponentially growing
PC-3 cells (3  106) were injected s.c. onto the right flank of each mouse
above the hind limb. Treatment was started on the day of tumor cell
injection and continued until the termination of the experiment (38 d after
tumor cell injection). Tumor volume was measured as described by us
previously (26). Tumor tissues were dissected and used for immunohistochemistry or immunoblotting. A portion of tumor tissue from control and
PEITC-treated mice was fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, dehydrated,
embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 4 to 5 Am thickness. Apoptotic
bodies in tumor sections were visualized by terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay using
ApopTag Plus Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis kit (Chemicon International)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Representative tumor sections
from control and PEITC-treated mice were fixed in acetone for 10 min at
4jC. After endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 3% hydrogen
peroxide for 15 min, the sections were treated with normal serum for
20 min. The sections were then incubated with anti-LC3 antibody (1:100
dilution) for 1 h at room temperature, washed with TBS, and treated with
biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min at room temperature. Characteristic
brown color was developed by incubation with 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine.
At least three nonoverlapping images from each tissue section were captured using a camera mounted onto the microscope.
Assessment of autophagy in Caenorhabditis elegans. The DA2123
strain (adIs2122[lgg-1:GFP rol-6(df)]) was generously provided by Dr.
Chanhee Kang (University of Texas Southwestern, Dallas, TX). Adult worms
were transferred to plates spotted with PEITC (10 or 25 Amol/L) or DMSO
(control). The plates were incubated at 20jC overnight. The worms were
mounted in M9 medium containing 10 mmol/L sodium azide and
photographed using an Olympus BX51 upright microscope at 40 objective
lens magnification.

Results
PEITC treatment caused autophagy in prostate cancer cells.
Figure 1A depicts effect of PEITC treatment on ultrastructures
of LNCaP and PC-3 cells. The DMSO-treated control LNCaP and
PC-3 cells exhibited normal complement of healthy looking mitochondria. Exposure of LNCaP and PC-3 cells to 5 Amol/L PEITC
for 6 hours (Fig. 1A) or 9 hours (data not shown) resulted in
appearance of membranous vacuoles resembling autophagosomes
(Fig. 1A, arrows), which were rare in DMSO-treated controls.
We confirmed autophagic response to PEITC by analysis of acidic
vesicular organelles (AVO) and processing and recruitment of
LC3, which are hallmarks of autophagy (27–29). As can be seen in

Fig. 1B, the DMSO-treated control LNCaP and PC-3 cells primarily
exhibited green fluorescence. On the other hand, treatment of
LNCaP and PC-3 cells with rapamycin (positive control) and PEITC
resulted in formation of yellow-orange AVOs. The LC3 protein
(18 kDa) is cleaved by autophagic stimuli to a 16-kDa intermediate
(LC3-II) that localizes to the autophagosomes (29). Recruitment of
LC3-II to the autophagosomes is characterized by punctate pattern
of its localization. The DMSO-treated control LNCaP cells (9-hour
treatment) exhibited diffuse and weak LC3-associated green
fluorescence (Fig. 1C). On the other hand, the LNCaP cells treated
for 9 hours with 5 Amol/L PEITC exhibited punctate pattern of LC3
immunostaining (Fig. 1C). A marked increase in fraction of cells
with punctate pattern of LC3 over DMSO-treated control was also
observed in LNCaP and PC-3 cells treated for 6 hours with 2.5 and
5 of Amol/L PEITC (results not shown). Punctate pattern of LC3
localization was not readily apparent by 5 Amol/L PEITC treatment
for 6 hours (Fig. 1C) or 9 hours (results not shown) in a normal
prostate epithelial cell line PrEC. Treatment of LNCaP and PC-3
cells with 2.5 and 5 Amol/L of PEITC for 6 and 9 hours resulted in
cleavage of LC3 (Fig. 1D). The control PrEC cells (DMSO treated)

exhibited higher levels of basal cleaved LC3. The PEITC-mediated
cleavage of LC3 was much less pronounced in the PrEC cell line
compared with prostate cancer cells (Fig. 1D). Collectively, these
observations indicated that PEITC treatment caused autophagy in
human prostate cancer cells.
PEITC-mediated autophagy correlated with suppression
of activating phosphorylations of Akt and mTOR. The protein kinase mTOR has emerged as a key negative regulator of
autophagy (21–23, 28). The activity of mTOR is regulated by Aktmediated phosphorylation of tuberin (30). To gain insight into
the mechanism of PEITC-mediated autophagy in our model, initially we determined the effect of PEITC treatment on activating
phosphorylations of Akt (S473) and mTOR (S2448) using LNCaP
and PC-3 cells (Fig. 2A). We found that PEITC treatment decreased
S473 phosphorylation of Akt in both LNCaP and PC-3 cells, albeit
more efficiently in the PC-3 cell line (Fig. 2A). The level of total
Akt protein was only modestly decreased (20–30% decrease compared with control) on treatment of LNCaP and PC-3 cells with
PEITC. The levels of S2448-phosphorylated mTOR and phosphorylation of mTOR downstream target p70s6k (T389) were also

decreased on treatment of LNCaP and PC-3 cells with PEITC
(Fig. 2A). The PEITC treatment transiently decreased the level of
mTOR protein in the LNCaP but not in the PC-3 cell line.
To determine functional significance of Akt suppression in
autophagic response to PEITC, we determined the effect of ectopic expression of constitutively active Akt (CA-Akt) on PEITCmediated cleavage and recruitment of LC3 using PC-3 and LNCaP
cells. Transient transfection of PC-3 cells with 3 Ag CA-Akt plasmid
DNA resulted in f1.8-fold increase in the levels of S473-phosphorylated Akt relative to empty vector–transfected control cells
(Fig. 2B). The PEITC-mediated cleavage of LC3 was f1.7-fold
higher in the empty vector–transfected control cells compared
with CA-Akt–overexpressing cells (Fig. 2B). Overexpression of
CA-Akt also conferred partial protection against PEITC-mediated
increase in fraction of cells with punctate LC3 over DMSO-treated
control in both PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines (Fig. 2C and D).
PEITC-induced autophagy was marginally affected by
overexpression of mTOR regulator Rheb. Because CA-Akt overexpression resulted in only partial protection against PEITCinduced autophagy, we carried out additional experiments
involving ectopic expression of Rheb to further define the role
of mTOR in autophagic response to PEITC. The Rheb activates
mTOR by antagonizing its endogenous inhibitor FKBP38 (31).
Ectopic expression of Rheb in PC-3 cells resulted in activation
of mTOR as evidenced by f3.1-fold increase in T389 phosphorylation of its downstream target p70s6k (Supplementary Fig. S1).
The Rheb-mediated activation of mTOR conferred marginal
protection against PEITC-mediated cleavage of LC3 (Supplementary Fig. S1). These results indicate that suppression of Akt/mTOR
cannot fully explain PEITC-mediated autophagy.

Atg5 knockdown conferred significant protection against
PEITC-mediated autophagy. Atg5 is required for formation of
autophagosomes and Atg5-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells
display significantly diminished number of autophagic vesicles (32).
Treatment of control nonspecific siRNA-transfected PC-3 cells with
5 Amol/L PEITC for 9 hours resulted in modest induction of
Atg5-12 complex (Fig. 3A). Atg5-12 was not detectable in PC-3
cells transiently transfected with a pool of three Atg5-targeted
siRNAs, confirming knockdown of this protein (Fig. 3A). The cleavage of LC3 resulting from a 9-hour exposure to 5 Amol/L PEITC
was suppressed by f50% in PC-3 cells with knockdown of Atg5
protein (Fig. 3A). The level of Atg5 was reduced by f80% in LNCaP
cells transiently transfected with the Atg5-targeted siRNA compared
with nonspecific siRNA-transfected LNCaP cells (Fig. 3B). The
PEITC-mediated cleavage of LC3 was f2.2-fold higher in nonspecific siRNA-transfected LNCaP cells than in the LNCaP cells
transfected with the Atg5-specific siRNA (Fig. 3B). In addition,
PEITC treatment (5 Amol/L, 9 hours) caused a significant increase
in fraction of cells with punctate LC3 over DMSO-treated control
in control siRNA-transfected cells, which was not observed in
cells transfected with the Atg5-targeted siRNA (Fig. 3C). Together,
these results indicated that the PEITC-induced autophagy was
regulated by Atg5.
Autophagy was not a protective mechanism against PEITCinduced apoptosis. Autophagy represents a protective mechanism
against apoptotic cell death under starvation as well as contributes
to resistance against therapy-induced apoptosis in cancer cells
(21, 22, 33–35). At the same time, autophagy has been suggested to
be a form of cell death, referred to as type II cell death, distinct
from apoptosis (type I cell death) for various antineoplastic agents

(36, 37). We proceeded to determine the role of autophagy in
growth suppression and apoptosis induction by PEITC using autophagy inhibitor 3-MA. The cytoplasmic histone-associated apoptotic DNA fragmentation, which is a widely accepted technique
for quantitation of apoptotic cell death, resulting from exposure of
LNCaP (Fig. 4A) and PC-3 (results not shown) to 5 Amol/L PEITC
for 16 hours was partially but statistically significantly attenuated
in the presence of 3-MA. Consistent with these results, the 3-MA
treatment conferred partial yet marked protection against PEITCmediated cleavage of procaspase-3 in LNCaP (Fig. 4B) and PC-3
cells (results not shown). Together, these results indicated that
PEITC can trigger both apoptosis (type I cell death) and autophagy
(type II cell death) in prostate cancer cells.
To further define the relationship between autophagy and apoptosis in our model, we determined the effect of Atg5 knockdown
on PEITC-mediated apoptosis. Consistent with the results using
3-MA (Fig. 4A and B), the cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA
fragmentation (Fig. 4C) and cleavage of procaspase-3 (Fig. 4D)
resulting from PEITC exposure (5 Amol/L, 9 hours) was signifi-

cantly attenuated by knockdown of Atg5 protein level in both PC-3
and LNCaP cells.
Oral administration of PEITC inhibited PC-3 xenograft
growth in association with increased apoptosis and LC3
cleavage in the tumor. We designed animal experiments to test
whether PEITC treatment caused autophagy in vivo. The average
tumor volume on the day of sacrifice (38 days after tumor cell
implantation) in mice gavaged with 9 Amol PEITC was lower by
f48% compared with the vehicle-treated control mice (Fig. 5A).
The body weights of the control and PEITC-treated mice did not
differ significantly throughout the experimental protocol (results
not shown). The H&E staining revealed a marked decrease in
nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio in the tumors from PEITC-treated mice
relative to control tumors, indicating suppression of cell proliferation by PEITC administration (Fig. 5A, right). The fraction of
brown-color TUNEL-positive apoptotic bodies was statistically
significantly higher in tumor sections from PEITC-treated mice
compared with control tumors (Fig. 5B). Moreover, the tumors from
PEITC-treated mice exhibited increased expression (Fig. 5C) as well

PEITC Causes Atg5-Mediated Autophagy and Apoptosis

as cleavage of LC3 (Fig. 5D). For example, cleaved LC3-II protein was
detectable in each tumor sample from the PEITC treatment group
but not in each tumor from control mice (Fig. 5D). These results
indicated that the PEITC-mediated suppression of PC-3 xenograft
growth in vivo was accompanied by apoptosis as well as autophagy.
PEITC treatment caused autophagy in C. elegans. To test
whether PEITC treatment caused autophagy in an intact organism,
we treated the adult nematode C. elegans with PEITC for 24 hours
and monitored autophagy by following the cellular localization of
the lgg-1:GFP fusion protein expressed by the DA2123 strain (38).
The lgg-1 is the worm ortholog of yeast Apg8p and mammalian
LC3. The lgg-1:GFP fusion protein has been shown to undergo
redistribution from diffuse cytoplasmic localization to form
punctate foci representing preautophagosomal and autophagosomal structures (39). Previous work has shown redistribution of
lgg-1:GFP in response to starvation, caloric restriction, and reductions in daf-2 insulin/insulin-like growth factor-I receptor signaling
(38–40). As can be seen in Fig. 6, treatment of DA2123 with either
10 or 25 Amol/L PEITC resulted in the formation of punctate
lgg-1:GFP foci in the intestine of worm in contrast to the diffuse
GFP expression seen in control worms. Results in C. elegans
provided added in vivo evidence for autophagy induction by PEITC
in an intact organism.

Discussion
The present study shows that dietary cancer chemopreventive
agent PEITC causes autophagy in cultured human prostate cancer
cells. Furthermore, oral administration of PEITC inhibits growth
of PC-3 xenograft in vivo in association with induction and
cleavage of LC3. The autophagic response to PEITC is rapid and
evident at low micromolar concentrations. The PEITC concentrations required to elicit autophagic response in cultured prostate
cancer cells (2.5–5 Amol/L) and in PC-3 xenograft in vivo (9 Amol/d
PEITC) are well within the range that can be generated through
dietary intake of cruciferous vegetables (41, 42). We also found that
a normal prostate epithelial cell line (PrEC) is markedly more
resistant to PEITC-mediated cleavage and recruitment of LC3.
Recent studies have pointed toward an important role of p53
tumor suppressor in regulation of autophagy (43). Our data suggest
that p53 is not necessary for PEITC-induced autophagy because
this response is observed in both wild-type p53-expressing LNCaP
cell line and p53-null PC-3 cells.
Molecular mechanism for autophagy induction in mammalian
cells is still not fully understood but at least 30 autophagy-related
genes have been identified in yeast (44). The mTOR has emerged
as a key negative regulator of autophagy in yeast and possibly in
mammalian cells (21–23, 45). Results of the present study indicate
that although PEITC treatment suppresses Akt-mTOR signaling

axis, this mechanism cannot fully explain PEITC-mediated autophagic response.
The connection between apoptotic (type I cell death) and
autophagic cell death (type II cell death) in the context of cancerrelevant stimuli is still unresolved, but autophagy seems to protect
against apoptosis in some models. For example, inhibition of
autophagy by chloroquine has been shown to increase activity
of the alkylating agent cyclophosphamide in a Myc-driven model of
lymphoma (34). Furthermore, 3-MA and chloroquine have been
shown to synergistically augment the proapoptotic response to a
histone deacetylase inhibitor (46). The results of the present study
clearly indicate that autophagy is not a protective mechanism
against PEITC-induced apoptosis at least in LNCaP and PC-3 cells
and that PEITC-mediated autophagy and apoptosis both contribute to PEITC-mediated suppression of prostate cancer cell growth.
The process of formation of autophagosomes is regulated by
multiple proteins, including Atg5. Previous studies have shown that
enforced expression of Atg5 not only promotes autophagy but
also enhances susceptibility toward apoptotic stimuli irrespective
of the cell type (47). Apoptosis was associated with calpainmediated cleavage of Atg5, resulting in translocation of truncated
Atg5 to mitochondria for its association with Bcl-xL (47). We found
that Atg5 protein status significantly affects autophagic response to
PEITC. Atg5 knockdown confers marked protection against PEITCmediated cleavage of LC3 in both PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines.
PEITC-mediated apoptotic DNA fragmentation in PC-3 and LNCaP
cells is also significantly suppressed by knockdown of Atg5 protein
level. These results not only show a critical role of Atg5 protein in
regulation of PEITC-mediated autophagy in prostate cancer cells
but also provide additional evidence to indicate that autophagy
and apoptosis are interrelated in cancer cell growth suppression by
PEITC. The mechanism by which Atg5 connects autophagic and
apoptotic responses to PEITC is not yet clear.
In conclusion, the present study indicates that PEITC treatment
selectively triggers autophagy in prostate cancer cells and that Atg5
is critically involved in regulation of PEITC-mediated autophagic
and apoptotic cell death.
