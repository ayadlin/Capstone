ABSTRACT
Evidence for long-term use of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) as an adjuvant
treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains limited. This study aimed to
assess the frequency of use, utilization patterns, and therapeutic effects of adjuvant
CHM for ischemic heart disease (IHD) in patients with T2D in Taiwan. We identified
4620 IHD patients with T2D. After matching for age, gender, and insulin use, 988
subjects each were allocated to a CHM group and a non-CHM group. There were
no differences in baseline characteristics except for comorbidities. The CHM group
contained more cases with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatitis, ulcer
disease, and hyperlipidemia. The cumulative survival probability was higher in
CHM users than in matched non-CHM users aged 60 years or older (P < .0001, log

rank test) regardless of gender (P = .0046 for men, P = .0010 for women, log rank
test). Among the top 12 CHM combinations, Shu-Jing-Huo-Xue-Tang and Shao-YaoGan-Cao-Tang (13.6%) were the most common. This dual combination improved
antiapoptotic activity in H2O2-exposed H9C2 cells by enhancing phosphorylation of
glycogen synthase kinase-3β and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and could
increase the survival of myocardial cells. Our study suggests that adjuvant CHM
therapy may increase the survival probability and provides a comprehensive list for
future investigations of the safety and efficacy of CHM for IHD patients with T2D.

In this study, we used a population-based database
to investigate demographic characteristics, overall
survival, and CHM prescribing patterns for individuals
with ischemic heart disease (IHD) complicating T2D.
In addition, we evaluated the ability of a combination
of herbal formulas and/or single herbs to protect
cardiomyocytes in a hypoxic state.

INTRODUCTION
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a disorder of glucose
metabolism that affects more than 6% of the population
worldwide [1]. The prevalence of T2D has been steadily
increasing in Asia [2], [3], [4]. T2D is regarded as glycemia
resulting from impaired β-cell function, decreased insulin
sensitivity in tissues, and increased glucose levels in the
blood [5]. Diabetic complications including cardiovascular
disease, retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and
peripheral circulatory disorders are believed to be
responsible for the symptoms, signs, ill-defined secondary
conditions, and mortality observed in these patients
[6], [7]. Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of
morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes. Overall,
cardiovascular mortality has been declining during recent
decades [8]. However, cardiovascular mortality among
T2D patients has been increasing [6], suggesting that
there are still unknown factors that contribute to the excess
cardiovascular risk in these patients.
Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) was being used for
the treatment of diabetes and its complications before the
development of insulin [9], [10], [11]. In Taiwan, CHM
is one of the important health care systems provided by
the National Health Insurance program [12], [13]. The
National Health Insurance database serves as a platform
for studying the frequency of use, utilization patterns,
and therapeutic effects of Chinese herbal therapies
prescribed by licensed CHM practitioners in Taiwan.
CHM prescribing patterns in Taiwan have been explored
by population-based studies in several diseases, including
childhood asthma [14], breast cancer [15], chronic kidney
disease [16], diabetes [17], endometriosis [18], primary
dysmenorrhea [19], and schizophrenia [20]. Blood glucose
levels can be controlled by lifestyle modification [21]
and treatment with hypoglycemic or anti-hyperglycemic,
insulin-sensitizing, and insulin secretion-enhancing
medications [22], [23], [24]. Increased cardiovascular risk
and mortality has been reported in patients with diabetes
using metformin, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones
[22], [23], [24], [25]. Long-term use of thiazolidinediones
increases the risks of bone fracture, lower respiratory tract
infection, and bladder cancer in patients with diabetes
[22], [26], [27]. These reports have prompted a search
for alternative and complementary therapies for better
management of diabetes and its complications.

RESULTS
Characteristics of study patients
A total of 4,620 patients diagnosed with IHD one
year after diagnosis of diabetes were included in our
study cohort (Figure 1). Of these, 1,274 (27.6%) were
in the CHM group and 3,346 (72.4%) were in the nonCHM group. The characteristics of the CHM group versus
the non-CHM group (all subjects) are shown in Table 1.
Statistically significant differences were found for age,
gender, time interval between diagnosis of diabetes and
that of IHD, comorbidities (chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease [COPD], hepatitis, ulcer disease, hyperlipidemia,
and obesity), income, and urbanization level between the
two groups (P < .05). The CHM group contained more
people who were younger, female, and had a longer time
interval between diabetes and diagnosis of IHD, more cases
of COPD, hepatitis, ulcer disease, hyperlipidemia, and
obesity, more people with a higher income, and more urban
dwellers. After matching the two groups for age, gender,
and insulin use, frequency matched CHM and non-CHM
users were compared (Table 1), and no differences were
found in the distribution of baseline characteristics, except
for comorbidities. There were significant differences in the
frequency distributions for COPD, hepatitis, ulcer disease,
and hyperlipidemia (P < .05). Matched subjects in the
CHM group were characterized by more cases of COPD,
hepatitis, ulcer disease, and hyperlipidemia, suggesting
that CHM users had more comorbidities.

Survival analysis according to CHM use
Figure 2A shows the cumulative probability of
survival after a diagnosis of IHD in subjects with a preexisting diagnosis of T2D according to use of CHM.
Overall survival rate between matched CHM and nonCHM users differed (P < .0001, log rank test). The

cumulative survival probability was higher in CHM users
than in matched non-CHM users. When the subjects
were stratified according to age—younger than 60 years
(Figure 2B) or 60 years or older (Figure 2C)—there
were no significant differences in survival probabilities
between matched CHM and non-CHM users (P =
.2260, log rank test). However, the survival rates were
significantly different between matched CHM and nonCHM users aged 60 years or older (P < .0001, log rank
test). The cumulative probability of survival was higher
in CHM users than in matched non-CHM users. When the
subjects were stratified according to whether they were
male (Figure 2D) or female (Figure 2E), survival rates

were significantly different between matched CHM and
non-CHM users for both men and women (P = .0046 and
P = .0010, respectively, log rank test). The cumulative
probability of survival was higher in CHM users than in
matched non-CHM users.
With regard to mortality, significant differences in
the protective effect of CHM were found when subjects
were stratified by age, gender, and time interval between
the diagnosis of diabetes and that of IHD (Figure 3). The
subgroup analysis showed that use of CHM was associated
with a protective effect in those who were aged 60 years
or older (hazard ratio [HR] 0.40, 95% confidence interval
[CI] 0.27–0.59) in both men (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33–0.80)

Effect of most commonly prescribed double
CHM combinations on H2O2-induced
dephosphorylation of GSK-3β and p38 MAPK in
H9C2 cells

DISCUSSION

Studies have shown that the apoptosis of myocardial
cells is involved in the development of cardiovascular
diseases, including IHD, where oxidative stress/injury
plays an important role [28], [29]. Therefore, the apoptosis
of myocardial cells is an important focus of research into
the control and prevention of cardiovascular disease.
Apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in H9C2 cells has
been associated with the phosphorylation states of GSK3ß and MAPKs, such as p38 MAPK [30], [31], [32].
Therefore, to explore the potential signaling pathways
contributing to the protective cardiovascular effect of
dual CHM combinations, we examined the activation of
GSK-3ß and p38 MAPK. We chose the most commonly
used dual CHM combinations, i.e., Shu-Jing-Huo-XueTang and Shao-Yao-Gan-Cao-Tang (herbal formula +
herbal formula) and Bei-Mu and Jie-Geng (single herb +
single herb) according to their percentage use per person.
H9C2 cells were treated with these herbs at the indicated
concentrations (Figure 6A). H2O2 and insulin were used
as the negative and positive controls, respectively. The
insulin-treated and CHM combination-treated cells were
then incubated with a H2O2 solution. As shown in Figure
6A, treatment with H2O2 decreased the phosphorylation
of GSK-3ß and p38 MAPK when compared with the cells
only. Treatment with H2O2 decreased the phosphorylation
of GSK-3ß to 34.7% (Figure 6B), which was recovered by
insulin (55.3%), Shu-Jing-Huo-Xue-Tang and Shao-Yao-

This population-based study shows that treatment
with the most commonly used dual CHM combinations
has additive benefits in improving survival in patients
diagnosed with IHD after a diagnosis of T2D and on
regular insulin therapy. The cumulative probability of
survival was higher in CHM users than in non-CHM
users. The most commonly used herbal formulas, single
herbs, and double CHM combinations were identified
and evaluated for their ability to protect against apoptosis
induced by oxidative stress in H9C2 (myocardial) cells.
We found that Shu-Jing-Huo-Xue-Tang, Shao-Yao-GanCao-Tang, and their combination had protective effects
against H2O2-induced H9C2 apoptosis and were able to
rescue the decreased phosphorylation of both GSK-3ß and
p38 MAPK. This suggests that these commonly used herbs
may have a role in antiapoptotic activity in H9C2 cells
exposed to H2O2 and may be beneficial for cell survival.
Our results suggest that adjunctive CHM combination
therapy may improve the overall survival rate of IHD
patients with T2D by increasing the survival of myocardial
cells.
Our study revealed a higher probability of overall
survival in IHD patients with T2D who were users of
CHM. Our study also revealed that mortality rates in
CHM users were not inferior to those in non-CHM
users (Supplementary Table 2). Several clinical studies
also support our observations. A combination of CHM

and conventional medicine might reduce major adverse
cardiac events (MACE) in coronary artery disease
patients, including all-cause death in hospital and
during one-year follow-up, acute myocardial infarction,
percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary artery
bypass graft [33]. In addition, adjunctive therapy with
Salvia miltiorrhiza (Dan-Shen) and Pueraria lobata
(Ge-Gen) in coronary patients led to improvements in
vascular function and structure by reducing the levels
of low density lipoprotein [34]. Adjunctive therapy with
Chinese herbal medicine improves blood perfusion, heart
function, and decreases the incidence of MACE in patients
with acute coronary syndrome after percutaneous coronary
intervention or after revascularization by intravenous
thrombolysis or coronary bypass [35][36]. CHM prevents

glucose tolerance to diabetes in hyperglycemia patients
[37], [38]. Further, CHM may exhibit pharmacological
actions including increasing insulin secretion and
sensitivity, enhancing the uptake of glucose by adipose
and muscle tissues, inhibiting glucose absorption by
the intestine, and inhibiting the production of glucose
by the liver [10], [11], [39]. These findings may explain
the better probability of survival seen in CHM users. We
also recorded the regular medications taken by CHM and
non-CHM users for the 365 days prior to the index date
(Supplementary Table 3). There was no difference in the
use of antidiabetic medication between the two groups,
except for sulfonylurea agents, which were more prevalent
in the non-CHM group. Conversely, more patients in the
CHM group used antihypertensive medication. There

was no difference in the use of antihyperlipidemic agents
between the two groups.
A higher probability of survival was still seen in
CHM users when stratified by age and sex. CHM use
was also associated with a protective effect against death
in patients aged 60 years or older, regardless of sex or
the time interval between diagnosis of diabetes and that
of IHD. In addition, when mortality risk was stratified
according to the herbs used, the most commonly used
herbal formulas and single herbs were associated with a
protective effect, except for Xuan-Shen. Protective effects
against death were also observed in users of double CHM
combinations, including Shu-Jing-Huo-Xue-Tang and
Shao-Yao-Gan-Cao-Tang, Niu-Xi and Du-Zhong, ShuJing-Huo-Xue-Tang and Du-Huo-Ji-Sheng-Tang, and XueFu-Zhu-Yu-Tang and Dan-Shen. Based on its protective
effect against death and high percentage of usage, we
chose Shu-Jing-Huo-Xue-Tang, Shao-Yao-Gan-Cao-Tang,
and their combination for the functional characterization
of their protective effect against H2O2-induced apoptosis
in cardiac cells. The decreased phosphorylation of both
GSK-3ß and p38 MAPK caused by H2O2 was rescued in
herb-treated cells (Supplementary Figure 1). The antiapoptotic activity of Shu-Jing-Huo-Xue-Tang, Shao-YaoGan-Cao-Tang, and their combination against H2O2 was
assessed using the TUNEL assay, which demonstrated
their protective effects (Supplementary Figure 2).
Shu-Jing-Huo-Xue-Tang is the herbal formula most
commonly prescribed for elderly people in Taiwan [40],
and is composed of 17 herbs. Shu-Jing-Huo-Xue-Tang has
been prescribed for hundreds of years to treat chronic pain
syndromes. It has also been used to treat other conditions,

including fractures [41] and prostate cancer, and to reduce
the risk of endometrial cancer in women with breast
cancer [42]. Shu-Jing-Huo-Xue-Tang has been reported
to have analgesic effects in a rat model of adjuvant
arthritis [43] and in rats with chronic constriction injury
[44]. Among the 17 single herbs in the formulation, Radix
Paeoniae Alba (Bai-Shao) and Radix Angelicae Sinensis
(Dang-Gui) are the major single herbs. Radix Paeoniae
Alba (Bai-Shao) is known to contain at least 11 chemical
compounds [45], one of which is paeoniflorin [45][46]
[47][48][49]. Paeoniflorin exhibits pharmacological
activities including anti-inflammatory [50], anti-oxidant
[51], and immunoregulatory activities [52]. Paeoniflorin
also had neuroprotective effects in a cerebral ischemia rat
model [53]. Furthermore, paeoniflorin attenuated acute
myocardial infarction in a rat model [54][55] and protected
diabetic mice against myocardial ischemic injury [56].
The two main components of Radix Angelicae Sinensis
(Dang-Gui) are ferulic acid and coniferyl ferulate [57]
[58]. Ferulic acid lowers blood pressure in spontaneously
hypertensive rats [59], induces antioxidant enzyme
activity [60], and is cardioprotective in experimental rat
models [61][62]. Coniferyl ferulate is an ester of ferulic
acid, and has multiple pharmacological activities including
antibacterial [63] and antioxidant effects [64].
Shao-Yao-Gan-Cao-Tang is composed of Radix
Paeoniae Alba (Bai-Shao) and Radix Glycyrrhizae
Preparata. It is the third most common herbal formula
prescribed for elderly people in Taiwan [40], and has also
been used to treat the acute pain associated with muscle
cramps via inhibiting the contraction of skeletal muscles
and normalizing intracellular and extracellular potassium

current balance [65], [66]. The three main components of
Shao-Yao-Gan-Cao-Tang are paeoniflorin, glycyrrhizin,
and glycyrrhizic acid [46][47][48][49]. Glycyrrhizin
enhances cardiac performance in rats [67][68], attenuates
Coxsackievirus B3-induced myocarditis [69], and protects
the rat heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury [70].
Glycyrrhizic acid also exhibits cardioprotective effects

against isoproterenol-induced myocardial ischemia in rats
[71] and improves lipoprotein lipase expression, insulin
sensitivity, serum lipid, and lipid deposition in high-fat
diet-induced obese rats [72].
We therefore examined the effects of these five
components (paeoniflorin, glycyrrhizin, glycyrrhizic
acid, ferulic acid, and coniferyl ferulate, respectively)

on the phosphorylation of GSK-3ß and p38 MAPK
in H9C2 cells and found that they have variable
effects on phosphorylation regulation (Supplementary
Figure 3). Among them, we found that paeoniflorin,
glycyrrhizic acid, and glycyrrhizin may enhance the
GSK-3ß phosphorylation, and paeoniflorin, ferulic acid,
and coniferyl ferulate may enhance the p38 MAPK
phosphorylation in H9C2 cells. Although there is no
evidence that Shu-Jing-Huo-Xue-Tang and Shao-YaoGan-Cao-Tang have beneficial effects on cardiovascular
diseases, either based on their formula or published
literature, the components in the two formulas may have
reacted with each other when mixed to treat the H9C2
cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show
that these CHM combinations may participate in the
antiapoptotic activity of H9C2 cells exposed to H2O2 via
phosphorylation of GSK-3ß and p38 MAPK, and could be
beneficial for cell survival.
The results of clinical research using the National
Health Insurance Research database in Taiwan combined
with our functional characterization of CHM in vitro may
provide evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of CHM. The
main limitation of this study is the lack of data on blood
chemistry in the National Health Insurance Research
database in Taiwan. CHM delayed mortality in IHD
patients with T2D but did not prevent it. CHM improves
overall survival in these patients and enhances the
antiapoptotic activity of cardiac cells. Our study provides
a comprehensive list of CHM products that may be useful
in future investigations of their safety and efficacy in IHD
patients with T2D.

Data source
The National Health Insurance Research database
(http://nhird.nhri.org.tw/en/index.htm) is available for
scientists in Taiwan for research purposes. The data used
in this study were retrieved from the “Longitudinal Health
Insurance Database (LHID2000 and LHID2005)”. This
database comprises a random sample of 1 million patients
alive from the NHIRD in 2000 (2005), which provides
longitudinally linked data for the 1996–2012 period.
The NHRI attests that no statistical differences in age,
sex and health care costs exist between the LHID2000
(LHID2005) data and those of all enrollees. In the
LHID2000 (LHID2005), the original identification number
for each patient is encrypted for privacy; however, all data
sets can be linked together through unique and anonymous
identifiers created by the NHRI. This database contains
detailed medical records for each patient, including
demographics, diagnoses, prescriptions, records of clinical
visits and hospitalizations, inpatient orders, ambulatory
care, and sociodemographic factors. Both licensed CHM
and Western medicinal practitioners follow a standard
diagnosis protocol using the International Classification of
Disease, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM).
We included 189,540 individuals with diabetes
(ICD-9-CM 250) between 1998 and 2010 (Figure 1).
The ICD-9-CM for IHD used in this study was 410–414.
Individuals under the age of 20 years were excluded.
People whose IHD predated their diabetes, those who had
15483

Oncotarget

IHD diagnosed within one year of being diagnosed to have
diabetes, and those who were diagnosed to have IHD after
2009 were also excluded. After all of these criteria were
applied, 4620 study subjects were included in the study.
People who had IHD diagnosed one year after being
diagnosed as having diabetes were included. People with
a cumulative number of CHM treatment days of more
than 28 within the first year after being diagnosed to have
IHD were defined as CHM users (n = 1, 274, Figure 1).
Study subjects with no record of CHM use were defined
as non-CHM users (n = 3, 346). The date on which the
criterion of 28 cumulative days of CHM prescription
was met was designated as the index date. Demographic
data, including age, gender, income and urbanization
level, were collected. Urbanization levels in Taiwan are
divided into five strata according to the Taiwan National
Health Research Institute, with level 1 referring to the
most urbanized communities and level 5 referring to
the least urbanized communities [73]. We identified the
comorbidities that had been diagnosed in CHM users and
non-CHM users before their diagnosis of IHD. These were
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; ICD-9-CM
490–496), hepatitis (ICD-9-CM 070), peptic ulcer disease
(ICD-9-CM 531–534), chronic kidney disease (ICD-9CM 582, 583–583.7, 585, 586, and 588), hyperlipidemia
(ICD-9-CM 272), obesity (ICD-9-CM 278 and 278.01),
alcoholism (ICD-9-CM 303, 305, 305.01, 305.02, 305.03,
and V11.3), and tobacco use (ICD-9-CM 305.1).
To reduce bias due to confounding variables,
non-CHM users were selected 1:1 after matching for
age, gender, and insulin use. In total, 988 subjects were
selected for each group (Table 1). The study end was
defined as the following: date of death, date of withdrawal
from the NHI program, or date of termination of follow-up
(31 Dec. 2010). This study was designed as a populationbased retrospective cohort study to explore the effect of
treatment with CHM on the overall survival rate of IHD
patients with T2D.

Cell culture, reagents, and western blotting
An H9C2 cell line (myocardial cells derived
from Rattus norvegicus) were maintained in Dulbecco's
modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 U/mL
streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco, Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Human insulin
solution (catalog number I9278), and hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2) solution (catalog number 18304) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). Control H9C2
cells were treated with insulin (400 nM) for 2 hours and
the experimental H9C2 cells were treated with a CHM
combination of Shu-Jing-Huo-Xue-Tang (1 mg/mL) and
Shao-Yao-Gan-Cao-Tang (1 mg/mL) or Bei-Mu (2.5 mg/
mL) and Jie-Geng (2.5 mg/mL) for 2 hours (Table 3;
Figure 6). The insulin-treated cells and CHM combinationtreated cells were then incubated in H2O2 solution (600
μM) for 30 minutes. The cells were then lysed in RIPA
buffer (catalog number 89900, Pierce, Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) with a protease inhibitor
(complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor, catalog number
11873580001, Roche Life Science, Sigma-Aldrich) and
a phosphatase inhibitor (catalog number 88667, Pierce),
subjected to 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis, and then transferred to polyvinylidene
fluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).
The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies
overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibodies included antiphospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182; D3F9, catalog
number 4511), anti-p38 MAPK (catalog number 9212),
anti-phospho-GSK-3β (Ser9, catalog number 9336S),
and anti-GSK-3β (catalog number 12456P) from Cell
Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA, USA), and antitubulin (catalog number 11224-1-AP), and anti-GAPDH
(catalog number 10494-1-AP) antibodies from Proteintech
Group Inc. (Rosemont, IL, USA). The membranes were
then incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated
secondary antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich). Signals were
visualized using a chemiluminescence kit (Chemicon),
following the manufacturer’s protocol.

Chinese herbal medicine
All drug codes for CHM (herbal formulas and single
herbs) were collected and grouped according to name.
For the CHM users, the frequencies of prescriptions,
cumulative drug doses (days), average duration per
prescription, and person years of follow-up were
calculated from index date to the study end. Single herbs
were from plant, animal, or mineral sources and could be
mixed with other herbs to create a combination product.
Herbal formulations usually constituted a combination of
more than two herbs (Supplementary Table 1), created
by knowledgeable practitioners of traditional Chinese
medicine; these formulas have been used for thousands
of years in China. The single herbs and herbal formulas
were all manufactured by traditional Chinese medicine
manufacturers with Good Manufacturing Practice

before index date, comorbidities (chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), hepatitis, ulcer disease,
chronic kidney disease (CKD), hyperlipidemia, obesity,
alcoholism, and tobacco use), income, and urbanization
level. Chi-squared tests were used to detect any
differences (Table 1). The top 12 most common herbal
formulas and single herbs used are shown in Table 2. The
Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate cumulative
probability of survival (Figure 2). The log-rank test was
used to explore the effect of CHM on the overall survival
rate of individuals after ischemic heart disease among
type 2 diabetes patients (CHM and non-CHM users).
Further, the subjects were stratified according to whether
they were younger than 60 years (Figure 2B) or 60 years
of age or older (Figure 2C) and whether they were male
(Figure 2D) or female (Figure 2E). A Cox proportional
hazard model adjusting for comorbidities, income, and
urbanization level was used to estimate the hazard ratio
(HR) of all-cause mortality in subjects after ischemic
heart disease among type 2 diabetes patients. All Pvalues less than .05 were considered to be statistically
significant. All data management and statistical analyses
were performed using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS
Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
