Abstract
Targeting cell surface receptors with cytotoxins or immunotoxins provides a unique opportunity for tumor therapy.
Here, we show the efficacy of the combination therapy of
gemcitabine with an interleukin-4 (IL-4) cytotoxin composed
of IL-4 and truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin in animal models
of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). We have observed that 42 of 70 (60%) tumor samples from patients with
PDA express moderate- to high-density surface IL-4 receptor
(IL-4R), whereas normal pancreatic samples express no or
low-density IL-4R. IL-4 cytotoxin was specifically and highly
cytotoxic [50% protein synthesis inhibition (IC50) ranging
from >0.1 to 13 ng/mL] to six of eight pancreatic cancer cell
lines, whereas no cytotoxicity (IC50 >1,000 ng/mL) was
observed in normal human pancreatic duct epithelium cells,
fibroblasts, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVEC). We also showed that IL-4 cytotoxin in combination
with gemcitabine exhibited synergistic antitumor activity
in vitro. To confirm synergistic antitumor activity in vivo
and monitor precise real-time disease progression, we used a
novel metastatic and orthotopic mouse model using green
fluorescent protein–transfected cancer cells and whole-body
imaging system. The combination of both agents caused
complete eradication of tumors in 40% of nude mice with
small established PDA tumors. In addition, combined treatment significantly prolonged the survival of nude mice
bearing day 14 advanced distant metastatic PDA tumors.
Similar results were observed in mice xenografted with PDA
obtained from a patient undergoing surgical resection. These
results indicate that IL-4 cytotoxin combined with gemcitabine may provide effective therapy for the treatment of
patients with PDA. [Cancer Res 2007;67(20):9903–12]

Introduction
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is one of the most
lethal human malignancies (32,000 deaths per year). Because of its
aggressive growth and rapid metastasis to lymph nodes and liver,
only 10% to 15% of patients are found to be resectable at diagnosis
(1). Currently, the most common strategy for the treatment of
advanced pancreatic cancer is treatment with gemcitabine,
although the median survival time continues to be <6 months for

these patients (2, 3). Recently, several types of inhibitors targeting
the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, platelet-derived
growth factor (PDGF) receptor, and nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB)
have shown their effectiveness in pancreatic cancer in murine
models (4–7). In clinical trials, EGF receptor tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (Erlotinib, Tarceva) plus gemcitabine enhances 1-year
survival for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer (8). However,
the difference in median survival between Erlotinib plus gemcitabine group and gemcitabine alone group is <1 month. An effective
new approach is needed for management of patients with this
disease.
Targeting cell surface receptor with cytotoxins or immunotoxins
provides a unique opportunity for tumor therapy. Targeted toxins
offer the advantage of enhanced specificity and direct toxicity for
tumor cells that overexpress the receptor, thus limiting the
potential toxicity to normal tissues (9). Several clinical trials using
IL-4 cytotoxin, IL-13 cytotoxin, and recombinant immunotoxin
BL22 have shown survival benefits in patients with glioblastoma
multiforme, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and hairy cell leukemia
(10–13).
Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is an important Th2-derived cytokine, which
is involved in mediating antitumor immune-modulating activities
(14). IL-4 has been shown to have a modest but direct inhibitory
effect on the growth of several tumor cells in vitro and in vivo
(15, 16). Based on these properties, IL-4 was tested in the clinic as a
treatment for hematopoietic and solid malignancies, but it showed
limited antitumor activity (17). To improve this limited activity, we
targeted IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) because a variety of human tumor
cells, including pancreatic cancer, express high-affinity receptors
for IL-4 (18–22). We have created a circular permuted IL-4, which
was fused to a mutated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin [the fusion
protein termed IL4(38-37)-PE38KDEL or IL-4 cytotoxin; ref. 23].
After binding to IL-4R, IL-4 cytotoxin internalizes, translocates, and
then ribosylates elongation factor 2 to prevent the initiation of
protein synthesis, leading to cell death (24). The IL-4 cytotoxin is
highly and specifically cytotoxic to several types of tumor cells
in vitro and has remarkable antitumor activity in animal xenograft
models of a variety of human tumors (18–22). The safety and
tolerability of IL-4 cytotoxin was shown in phase 1 clinical trials in
patients with advanced solid tumors (25). The efficacy of IL-4
cytotoxin was also shown by long-term survival of patients with
recurrent malignant glioma (10, 11, 26).
In this study, we examined expression of IL-4R in samples
derived from PDA and the efficacy of IL-4 cytotoxin, gemcitabine,
and combination of both in primary and metastatic tumor models.
To imitate aggressive clinical situation and to monitor precise
real-time disease progression, we used a novel metastatic and
orthotopic advanced pancreatic cancer model using retroviral
green fluorescent protein (GFP)–transfected pancreatic cancer cell

line and whole-body imaging system (27). Together, our study
shows that IL-4 cytotoxin synergizes with gemcitabine, significantly
inhibiting the growth of primary and metastatic tumor lesions,
prolonging the survival time, and completely eradicating tumors in
40% of mice in an early pancreatic cancer model.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, reagents, and tissue specimens. Cell lines were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection and Sciencell. Human
pancreatic duct epithelium (HPDE) cells were cultured routinely in
keratinocyte serum-free medium supplemented with bovine pituitary
extract and epidermal growth factor (Life Technologies; ref. 28). IL-4
cytotoxin [IL4(38-37)-PE38KDEL] was produced as described previously
(23). Fifteen paraffin-embedded tissue sections and tissue arrays containing
70 tumor specimens were obtained from Cooperative Human Tissue
Network and U.S. Biomax, respectively. Gemcitabine was procured through
the pharmacy of the clinical center (NIH).
Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Immunohistochemistry
was done as described previously (24). Deparafinized tissue sections were
incubated with anti-human IL-4Ra polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) or isotype control (IgG). The results were scored on the
basis of the density of staining 0%, 0% to 10%, 11% to 50%, 51% to 100% as
negative, weak, moderate, and strong, respectively. Tissue sections for IL-4R
were evaluated by Dr. Satoru Takahashi who is a pathologist at Nagoya City
University in Japan.
Expression of IL-4Ra on pancreatic cancer cell lines and HPDE cells was
assessed by flow cytometry using phycoerythrin-conjugated anti–IL-4Ra
monoclonal antibody as previously described (29). Staining with isotypematched IgG served as control.
Protein synthesis inhibition assay and assessment of synergism
or antagonism. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of IL-4 cytotoxin,
gemcitabine, and their combination was measured by the inhibition of
protein synthesis (18).
Drug interaction between IL-4 cytotoxin and gemcitabine was assessed
at a concentration ratio of 1:1, using the combination index (CI), where CI <
1, CI = 1, and CI > 1 indicate synergistic, additive, and antagonistic effects,
respectively (30). On the basis of the isobologram analysis for mutually
exclusive effects, the CI value was calculated as follows:
ðDÞ1
ðDÞ2
CI ¼
þ
ðDx Þ1 ðDx Þ2
where (Dx )1 and (Dx )2 are the concentrations of IL-4 cytotoxin and
gemcitabine, respectively, required to inhibit cell growth by 50%, and (D)1
and (D)2 are the drug concentrations in combination treatments that also
inhibit cell growth by 50% (isoeffective compared with the single drugs).
Semiquantitative and real-time TaqMan reverse transcription-PCR.
Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was done as described previously (31). Quantification of IL-4Ra mRNA expression levels in
pancreatic cancer cell lines was determined by real-time RT-PCR using a set
of IL-4Ra–specific TaqMan probe (5¶-FAM, 3¶-MGB) and primers (Applied
Biosystems; ref. 24). Gene expression was normalized to glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase or h-actin before the fold change in gene
expression was calculated.
Retroviral transduction and selection of high-GFP–expressing MIAPaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells. MIA-PaCa-2 cells expressing GFP were
established using a 1:1 precipitated mixture of retroviral supernatants of the
HEK293 cells and RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.), as described
previously (32).
Animals. Severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice and nude
nu/nu mice between age 5 and 6 weeks were maintained in a barrier facility
on HEPA-filtered racks. All animal studies were conducted under an
approved protocol in accordance with the principles and procedures
outlined in the NIH Guideline for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Whole-body imaging. The tumor-bearing mice were periodically
examined in a fluorescence light box illuminated by fiberoptic light at

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (20). October 15, 2007

440/20 nm wavelength (Lightools Research, Inc.). Emitted fluorescence
was collected through a long-pass filter GG475 (Chroma Technology)
on a Hamamatsu C5810 3-chip cooled color charge coupled device
camera (Hamamatsu Photonics Systems). Real-time determination of tumor
burden was done by quantifying fluorescent surface area as described
previously (32).
Surgical orthotopic implantation of MIA-PaCa-2-GFP tumors.
MIA-PaCa-2-GFP cells were injected s.c. into the right dorsal flank of nude
mice. Pancreatic tumors, grown s.c. in nude mice, were cut with scissors
and minced into f3  3  3-mm pieces. For orthotopic surgery, the
pancreas was carefully exposed, and tumor chunks were transplanted on
the middle of the pancreas with a 6-0 Dexon surgical suture (Davis-Geck,
Inc.). The pancreas was then returned to the peritoneal cavity, the
abdominal wall, and the skin was closed with 6-0 Dexon sutures.
Experimental design and treatment. For early pancreatic cancer
model, primary tumor lesions were detected by external whole-body
imaging on day 4 after transplantation. Once the tumors were visualized,
mice were randomized into four groups of 10 each. Treatment was initiated
on day 5. For advanced pancreatic cancer model, primary and metastasis
tumor lesions were detected by external whole-body imaging on day 14
posttransplantation of tumor chunk and randomized into four groups of 10
mice each. Treatment was initiated on day 15.
Primary and orthotopic pancreatic cancer model using a clinical
sample. Primary pancreatic cancer specimens were obtained from a patient
undergoing radical pancreatectomy at National Cancer Institute under
institutional review board–approved protocol. Viable tumor tissue from
specimen was cut into small pieces (3  3  3 mm) and implanted in the
pancreas of 5- to 6-week-old male SCID mice. Primary xenografts were
propagated continuously in SCID mice for in vivo testing. Clinical sample–
bearing mice were also treated after day 31 by the same protocol as
described above.
Statistical analysis. The mean tumor volume in therapeutic and control
groups was analyzed by ANOVA. Survival curves were generated by KaplanMeier method and compared by using the log-rank test.

Result
Expression of IL-4R in PDA tissues. Tissue sections from 15
normal pancreas and 70 PDA specimens were analyzed by
immunohistochemical analysis for the expression of IL-4Ra (data
not shown). As shown in Fig. 1A, tumor specimens showed weak
to strong staining for IL-4Ra in PDAs. Only weak staining was
observed in tumor-infiltrating stromal fibroblasts and endothelial
cells. When the proportion of IL-4Ra–positive cancer cells was
counted, 23 of 70 primary tumors classified into strong expression
group, 19 into moderate expression group, 11 into weak
expression group, and 17 into the negative expression group.
Thus, 42 of 70 (60%) PDA samples expressed moderate to highdensity IL-4Ra. In contrast, only 2 of 15 normal pancreas samples
showed weak staining for IL-4Ra in normal acinar and ductal cells
(Fig. 1B).
Pancreatic cancer cell lines expressing IL-4R are sensitive to
IL-4 cytotoxin. We examined the expression of IL-4Ra mRNA by
RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR in eight pancreatic cancer and one
normal HPDE cell lines. Six of eight cancer cell lines showed varied
density of IL-4Ra mRNA expression, whereas HPAF-II, PK-1, and
HPDE cell lines showed no expression (data not shown). Real-time
RT-PCR analysis confirmed conventional RT-PCR results and
showed that MIA-PaCa-2 and SW1990 cell lines expresses highest
level of IL-4Ra mRNA, followed by Capan-1, ASPC-1, Panc-1, and
HS766T cell lines (Fig. 1C). Flow cytometric analysis confirmed
mRNA expression data and showed that IL-4Ra is expressed on the
cell surface of three pancreatic cancer cell lines but not in normal
HPDE cells (Fig. 1D).

Staining with isotype-matched IgG
served as control (shaded curve ).

Next, we determined the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cell
lines to IL-4 cytotoxin by protein synthesis inhibition assay, which
has been shown to be directly proportional to cell death (19). IL-4
cytotoxin inhibited protein synthesis of pancreatic cancer cell lines
in a concentration-dependent manner. MIA-PaCa-2 and SW1990
cell lines were extremely sensitive to the cytotoxin (IC50 0.08 and
0.36 ng/mL, respectively), followed by Capan-1 (IC50 7 ng/mL) and
HS766T (IC50 13 ng/mL; Fig. 2A). IC50 in Panc-1 and ASPC-1 cell
lines was <10 ng/mL (data not shown). Consistent with the lack of
IL-4Ra mRNA expression, HPAF-II and PK-1 cell lines were not
sensitive to IL-4 cytotoxin (IC50 z 1,000 ng/mL; data not shown).
The cytotoxic activity of IL-4 cytotoxin was neutralized by
incubation with an excess of IL-4, suggesting specific cytotoxicity
through binding of IL-4 cytotoxin to IL-4R (data not shown). We
also examined the cytotoxicity of IL-4 cytotoxin in fibroblast,
HUVEC, and HPDE cell lines, because some of the specimens
revealed weak expression of IL-4Ra in nontumor cells. However,

www.aacrjournals.org

IL-4 cytotoxin was not found to be cytotoxic to these cells (IC50 z
1,000 ng/mL; Fig. 2B). The IL-4 cytotoxin cytotoxic activity
correlated with extent of IL-4Ra expression. For example, MIAPaCa-2 cells showed lowest IC50 and highest density IL-4R
expression as determined by flow cytometric and real-time PCR
analyses whereas PK-1 cell line showed highest IC50 as this cell line
showed undetectable level of mRNA expression. We also used
another cytotoxin IL-13 Pseudomonas exotoxin, an IL-13 receptorspecific fusion protein (12), to assess the cytotoxicity to pancreatic
cancer cell line. However, IL-13 cytotoxin was not cytotoxic to
HPAF-II cells (IC50 z1,000 ng/mL; data not shown).
Synergistic cytotoxicity of IL-4 cytotoxin and gemcitabine in
pancreatic cancer cell lines. Gemcitabine alone mediated a dosedependent inhibition of protein synthesis with IC50 of 22 nmol/L in
MIA-PaCa-2 cells, 3.2 nmol/L in Capan-1 cells, 1,000 nmol/L in
SW1990 cells, and 14 nmol/L in HS766T cells (Table 1). When it was
combined with IL-4 cytotoxin, the protein synthesis inhibition in

Figure 2. Cytotoxic activity of IL-4 cytotoxin in pancreatic cancer cell lines (A),
and in normal HPDE, fibroblast, and HUVEC (B). Cells (1  104) were incubated
with various concentrations of IL-4 cytotoxin (0–1,000 ng/mL). Bars, SD of
quadruplicate determinations. The assay was repeated twice. C, cytotoxic
activity of simultaneous exposure of IL-4 cytotoxin and gemcitabine against
MIA-PaCa-2 cell line. In vitro cytotoxic activity of IL-4 cytotoxin (0–10 ng/mL) with
or without various concentrations of gemcitabine (0.03–30 nmol/L) was
assessed by protein synthesis inhibition assay.

MIA-PaCa-2 cells was greatly enhanced: IC50 of IL-4 cytotoxin
became 0.012, 0.001, and 0.00004 ng/mL by adding 0.03, 0.3, and 3
nmol/L gemcitabine, respectively (Fig. 2C). These same phenomena were also observed in SW1990 and Capan-1 cells, but not in
HS766T cells (data not shown). The combination index at IC50 and
IC75 (concentration of drug causing 75% inhibition of protein
synthesis) in MIA-PaCa-2, SW1990, and Capan-1 cells was <1 at all
concentrations of gemcitabine (Table 1).
In vivo whole-body optical imaging of PDA. We developed
pancreatic cancer models to investigate antitumor effects of IL-4
cytotoxin and showed its correlation with imaging studies in vivo.
Pancreatic cancer cells were transfected with GFP. Our transfection
technique using retroviral vector revealed consistent bright
GFP fluorescence of MIA-PaCa-2 cells. There was no significant
difference in morphology, growth rate, and sensitivity to IL-4
cytotoxin between parent and GFP-transfected cells (data not
shown). GFP-transfected MIA-PaCa-2 tumor chunks were orthotopically transplanted to pancreas of nude mice. These tumor

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (20). October 15, 2007

pieces were derived from MIA-PaCa-2-GFP cells transplanted s.c.
As shown in Figs. 3A and 4A, GFP fluorescence enabled real-time
and sequential whole-body imaging of tumors. Noninvasive
quantitative measurements of external visible fluorescent area
enabled the construction of in vivo tumor growth curves, which
seem to correlate with visible tumor growth (Figs. 3B and 4B).
Complete eradication of tumors by combination of IL-4
cytotoxin and gemcitabine in an early tumor model. Small
primary tumor lesions on day 4 after transplantation were
observed in all mice by the real-time whole-body imaging (average
fluorescent area 26.17 F 4.19 mm2). Imaging studies on days 14 and
24 confirmed the significant primary tumor growth and metastasis
in nontreatment group (Fig. 3A). In contrast, gemcitabine or IL-4
cytotoxin treatment group showed a reduction in the rate of tumor
growth, compared with nontreatment group (Fig. 3A and B). The
IL-4 cytotoxin treatment group showed no tumor lesions in 6 of 10
mice on day 14, although tumor recurred by day 34. Remarkably,
the combination treatment group revealed significant suppression
of tumor growth of primary tumor lesions. Tumor lesions were
undetectable in all 10 mice on day 14. By day 44, 6 of 10 mice
showed local recurrence and distant metastasis as shown in the
bottom row of Fig. 3A. The rest of the four mice showed complete
eradication of tumor and mice remained tumor-free through day 94
when the experiment was terminated.
Synergistic increase in survival of mice treated with a
combination of IL-4 cytotoxin and gemcitabine in an early
tumor model. As shown in Fig. 3C, median survival time of
animals was 27 days in nontreatment group, whereas it was
significantly increased to 54, 64, and 92 days in gemcitabine group
(P < 0.0001), IL-4 cytotoxin group (P < 0.0001), and their
combination group (P < 0.0001) compared with nontreatment
group, respectively. Compared with gemcitabine group, significant
prolonged survival time was observed in IL-4 cytotoxin group
(P = 0.017) and the combination group (P < 0.0001). Increase
in significant survival advantage correlated with tumor area as
detected by GFP fluorescence. Prolonged survival time in the
combination group was 341% compared with the nontreatment
group. In addition, we did not observe any organ toxicity in heart,
liver, lung, kidney, and spleen of IL-4 cytotoxin–injected mice
evaluated by histologic examination (data not shown).
Real-time imaging of tumor growth of the primary and
metastasis lesion in an advanced in vivo model. As f85%
patients with PDA are diagnosed at an advanced stage at initial
diagnosis, an advanced PDA in vivo model needs to be established
to imitate the clinical situation and to monitor the disease and
treatment effect (33). Fluorescence imaging on day 14 posttransplantation confirmed the tumor growth of primary lesions in all
mice and also detected the metastasis lesions to liver, lymph nodes,
and peritoneal locations in 40 of 62 mice. Six mice showed
metastatic lesions to liver or lymph nodes around hepatoduodenum ligament, 8 showed metastasis lesions corresponding to
peritoneal locations, and 26 with both metastasis lesions. We did
not include mice with the GFP spot at spleen as a metastasis group.
Forty mice with confirmed primary and metastasis tumor lesions
on day 14 posttransplantation were divided into four groups and
treated as described in Materials and Methods (average fluorescent
area 94.67 F 8.31 mm2). The real-time whole-body imaging of
tumor growth confirmed the significant primary tumor growth and
metastatic spread on days 14, 21, and 28 after transplantation of
tumor in nontreatment control group (Fig. 4A). Gemcitabine and
IL-4 cytotoxin treatment group showed a reduction in the rate of

tumor growth compared with the nontreatment group (Fig. 4B).
Especially, the combination treatment group revealed significant
suppression of tumor growth at primary and metastasis tumor
lesions. The reduction in tumor size on day 28 was 39.8% in the
gemcitabine group (P < 0.001), 71.2% in the IL-4 cytotoxin group
(P < 0.001), and 79.6% in the combination group (P < 0.001)
compared with the no treatment group.
Combination of IL-4 cytotoxin and gemcitabine prolongs
the survival of mice with advanced orthotopic pancreatic
tumor. We examined the efficacy of IL-4 cytotoxin on survival of
animals in an advanced PDA model. As shown in Fig. 4C, median
survival time of animals was 28 days in nontreatment group,
whereas it was significantly increased to 34, 43, and 52 days in
gemcitabine group (P = 0.0089), IL-4 cytotoxin group (P < 0.0001),
and their combination group (P < 0.0001), respectively. Compared
with gemcitabine group, significant prolonged survival time was
also observed in the IL-4 cytotoxin group (P = 0.0047) and the
combination group (P = 0.0002). Prolonged survival time in the
combination group was 186% compared with the nontreatment
group. Increase in significant prolongation of survival correlated
with tumor area as detected by whole-body imaging.
Expression of IL-4R in a clinical sample and development of
orthotopic xenograft tumor model. We obtained a tumor tissue
sample that was surgically resected at Surgery Branch at NIH and
pathologically diagnosed as moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (data not shown). This tumor section showed strong staining

for IL-4Ra in the ductal adenocarcinoma cells and faint staining of
fibroblasts (Fig. 5A). We also established tumor and fibroblast cells
cultured from this sample to examine the antitumor activity of IL-4
cytotoxin. The cancer cells expressing IL-4R were highly sensitive
to IL-4 cytotoxin (IC50 0.32 ng/mL), whereas fibroblast cells were
not sensitive (IC50 z1,000 ng/mL; Fig. 5B).
IL-4 cytotoxin, gemcitabine, and their combination significantly prolonged survival of mice transplanted with a clinical
pancreatic cancer sample. The clinical sample was orthotopically
transplanted on the pancreas of SCID mice and when tumors grew,
they were harvested and then orthotopically propagated in the next
set of SCID mice. All mice showed growth of primary tumor and
metastasis to lymph nodes in peritoneum, hepatoduodenum
ligament, and para-aortic areas. Seventy-five percent of these mice
showed the metastasis lesion to liver when mice were sacrificed 30
days after tumor implantation (Fig. 5C). To assess the effect of IL-4
cytotoxin in an advanced metastasis model, a third set of SCID
mice were orthotopically implanted with tumor pieces obtained
from the second set of mice. These mice, when advanced disease
developed, were divided into four groups on day 31 and treated as
described in Materials and Methods. As shown in Fig. 5D, median
survival time of animals was 62 days in the nontreatment group,
whereas it was significantly increased to 86, 102, and 134 days
in the gemcitabine group (P = 0.0081), IL-4 cytotoxin group
(P = 0.0006), and combination group (P < 0.0001), respectively.
Compared with gemcitabine, significant prolonged survival time

was observed of IL-4 cytotoxin–treated mice (P = 0.0037) and the
combination group (P < 0.0001). Prolonged survival time in the
combination group was 216% compared with the nontreatment
group.

Discussion
We show that 60% PDA samples express moderate- to highdensity surface IL-4Rs, whereas normal pancreas express no or very
low levels of IL-4R. IL-4 cytotoxin is highly cytotoxic to pancreatic
cancer cell lines; however, it was not cytotoxic to HPDE cells,
fibroblasts, and HUVEC, which express no or low levels of IL-4R.
We also show that IL-4 cytotoxin synergizes with gemcitabine in
mediating cytotoxic activity in pancreatic cancer cell lines in vitro,
and in animal models of human pancreatic cancer in vivo. A
significant prolonged survival effect of IL-4 cytotoxin and its

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (20). October 15, 2007

combination with gemcitabine was shown in mice with early
disease. Forty percent of mice that received combination therapy
showed complete eradication of pancreatic tumors. In addition,
this significant survival benefit was also confirmed in animals
implanted with the clinical pancreatic cancer sample.
Gemcitabine (Gemzar) is a widely accepted first-line therapy for
advanced pancreatic cancer, although the median survival time
continues to be <6 months for these patients (2, 3). As most studies
using single agent show low response rate and little effect on
patient survival in advanced adenocarcinoma, several clinical trials
using a combined approach of radiotherapy and/or molecular
target therapy with gemcitabine have been initiated (33). In vitro
studies have reported synergistic effect of gemcitabine with
cisplatin, fluvastatin hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides, EGFR, PDGF, and vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor targeting drugs (6, 34–37). In

IL-4 Cytotoxin Synergizes with Gemcitabine

addition, immunotoxins were shown to exert synergistic effect with
chemotherapeutic drugs, for example, doxorubicin plus anti–B4blocked ricin, Ara-C plus granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor fused to truncated diphtheria toxin (DT388-GM-CSF),
and fludarabine with rituximab saporin-S6 conjugated protein
(38–40). These studies support our observations of gemcitabine
synergizing with IL-4 cytotoxin. Despite synergistic effect with
gemcitabine, few combinations have shown clinical advantage
(4–7). For example, although EGFR inhibitor showed synergistic
antitumor effect in preclinical models, the survival benefits for
patients with advanced pancreatic cancer seem very modest at
best. It was later found that mutations in the EGFR gene, which
correlate with clinical response, are found in <5% of pancreatic
cancer patients (8, 41). Therefore, new effective therapies that do
not depend on receptor mutation are needed. As our results show
the survival benefit by IL-4 cytotoxin when combined with
gemcitabine in both early and advanced pancreatic cancer models,
it is possible that this novel approach will afford better tumor
responses than previously observed.

The precise mechanism of synergistic effect of gemcitabine with
IL-4 cytotoxin is not known. Gemcitabine is a synthetic pyrimidine
antimetabolite structurally related to cytarabine (42). Gemcitabine
inhibits DNA synthesis through inhibition of ribonucleotide
reductase and depletion of deoxynucleotide pools. On the other
hand, IL-4 cytotoxin inhibits protein synthesis after internalization
into an endosome. In addition, we have previously shown that IL-4
cytotoxin can cause apoptotic cell death of cancer cells regardless
of the cell cycle status (43). It is possible that gemcitabine
enhances apoptotic cell death induced by IL-4 cytotoxin. Because
apoptosis is a prominent mechanism of cancer cell death, the
combination therapy of these drugs, which act through different
mechanism, may be a beneficial treatment option for patients
with PDA.
We studied two types of advanced pancreatic cancer models to
show the antitumor activity of IL-4 cytotoxin and gemcitabine. In
orthotopic model, the freshly resected clinical tumor was
implanted to pancreas of SCID mice. It has been reported that
this model recapitulates the natural history of the clinical disease,

including the invasive and metastatic pattern (44). Accordingly, the
peritoneal organs, lymph nodes, liver, and spleen of mice in our
model showed tumor metastasis and invasion 1 month after
transplantation. IL-4 cytotoxin and gemcitabine showed remarkable antitumor effects in this model. In future studies, it will be of
interest to determine whether metastatic lesions to various organs
express IL-4R, and after treatment with IL-4 cytotoxin these
receptor levels decrease along with disappearing tumor. In other
orthotopic tumor model, tumor pieces developed from MIPaCa-2GFP cells by s.c. is implanted to pancreas of nude mice. In this
model, IL-4 cytotoxin as well as gemcitabine caused profound
antitumor effects. These data are compatible with our previous
report that showed the survival benefit by IL-4 cytotoxin alone in
orthotopic early and advanced animal models using Panc-1 and
BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cell lines (19). Although we did not test
IL-4R–negative tumor in vivo models, our previous studies have
shown that non–small cell lung cancer cell line expressing no or
low IL-4R are not sensitive to IL-4 cytotoxin in vivo (20). Similar
conclusions were drawn in squamous cell carcinoma of head and
neck tumor models (45). Thus, IL-4 cytotoxin and gemcitabine
show better survival benefit compared with either agent alone in
two pancreatic tumor models, one derived from clinical sample
and the other derived from MIPaCa-2 cell line.
The whole-body imaging of host visualizes the real-time tumor
growth at the primary site and tumor development at metastasis
sites without the invasive procedures, surgery, anesthesia, or use of
contrast medium. Due to the fact that whole-body imaging has the

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (20). October 15, 2007

potential of high correlation with MRI in quantifying tumor
volume, the precise evaluation of tumor growth rate, metastatic
situation, and effectiveness of drugs could all be monitored without
sacrificing animals (32, 46). In addition, imaging may identify
biomarker of tumor response in preclinical models that can be
validated in the clinical trial (47). A recent article reported that red
fluorescent protein showed brighter and less background image
compared with GFP, when animals were imaged (48). In our study,
we used GFP-transfected cells. Therefore, it is possible that we were
not able to detect micrometastasis lesions. Nevertheless, we could
show that mice developed spontaneous tumor metastasis within
the short time after orthotopic transplantation, which correlated
with short survival time. In addition, our model showed that IL-4
cytotoxin reduced the rate of tumor growth, including primary and
metastasis lesions for 15 and 9 days after treatment in early and
advanced model, respectively.
Although IL-4 cytotoxin mediated remarkable antitumor effects
in vivo, no visible signs of toxicity and features such as weight loss
and inactivity were observed in mice receiving optimal doses of IL4 cytotoxin and/or gemcitabine (data not shown). These results are
compatible with previous studies related to both agents (data not
shown; refs. 19, 24, 49). Previous studies have shown that lowdensity IL-4R are expressed on normal immunologic and nonhematopoietic cells (22). Consequently, IL-4 cytotoxin is not
cytotoxic to these cells. Preclinical toxicity studies in mice have
shown that IL-4 cytotoxin is well tolerated up to 475 Ag/kg dose
given i.v. (50). As human IL-4 does not bind murine IL-4R, IL-4

cytotoxin has also been administered to cynomolgus monkeys,
whose IL-4R binds human IL-4. In these animals, IL-4 cytotoxin
was reasonably tolerated up to a dose of 200 Ag/kg given i.v. every
alternate day for three injections (21). In a phase 1 clinical trial,
reversible elevation of liver enzymes and injection site inflammatory reactions were reported after i.v. administration of IL-4
cytotoxin at 0.027 mg/m2 (25). As our study shows synergistic
effects when IL-4 cytotoxin is combined with gemcitabine against
pancreatic cancer in vitro and in vivo, lower doses of IL-4 cytotoxin
may be effective for the treatment of patients with PDA when
combined with gemcitabine.
In conclusion, these studies provide a novel approach for
monitoring tumor response by whole-body imaging of the host.
Further studies should be done to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
