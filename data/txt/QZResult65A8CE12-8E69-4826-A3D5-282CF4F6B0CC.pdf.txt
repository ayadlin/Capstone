Abstract

Author Manuscript

Sex in mammals is determined in the foetal gonad by the presence or absence of the Y
chromosome gene Sry, which controls whether bipotential precursor cells differentiate into
testicular Sertoli cells or ovarian granulosa cells1. This pivotal decision in a single gonadal cell
type ultimately controls sexual differentiation throughout the body. Sex determination can be
viewed as a battle for primacy in the foetal gonad between a male regulatory gene network in
which Sry activates Sox9 and a female network involving Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Supplemental
Fig. 1)2. In females the primary sex-determining decision is not final: loss of the FOXL2
transcription factor in adult granulosa cells can reprogramme granulosa cells into Sertoli cells2.
Here we show that sexual fate is also surprisingly labile in the testis: loss of the DMRT1
transcription factor3 in mouse Sertoli cells, even in adults, activates Foxl2 and reprogrammes
Sertoli cells into granulosa cells. In this environment, theca cells form, oestrogen is produced, and
germ cells appear feminized. Thus Dmrt1 is essential to maintain mammalian testis determination,
and competing regulatory networks maintain gonadal sex long after the foetal choice between
male and female. Dmrt1 and Foxl2 are conserved throughout vertebrates4,5 and Dmrt1-related
sexual regulators are conserved throughout metazoans3. Antagonism between Dmrt1 and Foxl2
for control of gonadal sex may therefore extend beyond mammals. Reprogramming due to loss of

Dmrt1 also may help explain the etiology of human syndromes linked to DMRT1, including
disorders of sexual differentiation6 and testicular cancer7.
Human chromosome 9p deletions removing DMRT1 are associated with XY male-to-female
sex reversal, and Dmrt1 homologues determine sex in several non-mammalian
vertebrates8,9,10. In mice, Dmrt1 is expressed and required in both germ cells and Sertoli
cells of the testis11,12,13. XY Dmrt1 null mutant mice are born as males with testes, although
these gonads later undergo abnormal differentiation14; hence the role of Dmrt1 in
mammalian sex determination has been unclear. Here we examine Dmrt1 mutant testes
during postnatal development, asking whether loss of Dmrt1 causes postnatal feminization
in mice.

Author Manuscript

We first examined gonads of Dmrt1 null mutant males (Dmrt1−/−) for the presence of
FOXL2, a female-specific transcription factor expressed in granulosa cells and theca
cells15,16, the two somatic cell types of the ovarian follicle (Fig. 1a). Four weeks after birth,
abundant FOXL2-positive cells were present within mutant seminiferous tubules (Fig. 1b),
which in control testes contain only germ cells and Sertoli cells (Fig 1c). To establish the
origin of the FOXL2-positive cells, we deleted Dmrt1 either in germ cells (using Nanos3cre) or in Sertoli cells (using Dhh-cre or Sf1-cre) (Supplemental Fig. 2a–l; Supplemental
Table 1). Loss of Dmrt1 in foetal Sertoli cells (SCDmrt1KO) but not in foetal germ cells
(GCDmrt1KO) induced FOXL2 expression (Fig. 1d–f). SCDmrt1KO gonads retained small
numbers of germ cells, which appeared to arrest in meiotic prophase based on SYCP3
localization (Supplemental Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that DMRT1 expression in
Sertoli cells prevents FOXL2 expression and suggest that Dmrt1 mutant testes become
feminized during the first postnatal month.

Author Manuscript

Next we examined the timing of FOXL2 induction. At postnatal day 7 (P7), SCDmrt1KO
testes had seminiferous tubules in which all Sertoli cells expressed SOX9 normally
(Supplemental Fig. 2m–r), but at P14 some intratubular cells co-expressed SOX9 and
FOXL2 or lacked SOX9 and strongly expressed FOXL2 (Fig. 1g–l). By P28 few SOX9positive cells remained and most intratubular cells strongly expressed FOXL2 (Fig. 1m–o).
Histologic analysis of mutant gonads is shown in Supplemental Fig. 4. These results show
that foetal loss of Dmrt1 causes postnatal Sertoli cells to lose the male-promoting SOX9 and
instead express the female-promoting FOXL2.

Author Manuscript

Loss of Foxl2 in the adult ovary can lead to transdifferentiation of granulosa cells to Sertoli
cells2, so we asked whether loss of Dmrt1 in the adult testis activates Foxl2 and causes the
reciprocal sex transformation, from Sertoli to granulosa. Indeed, one month after deletion of
Dmrt1 in adult males (using a tamoxifen-inducible cre transgene), we observed cells with
typical Sertoli cell features including tripartite nucleoli but expressing both SOX9 and
FOXL2 (Fig. 2a–d), as well as cells with typical granulosa cell nuclear morphology that
lacked SOX9 and strongly expressed FOXL2 (Fig. 2e–h). Thus antagonism between
DMRT1 and FOXL2 continues into adulthood and Sertoli cell fate remains plastic even after
terminal differentiation.

To further evaluate the transformation of mutant gonads, we compared the mRNA profile of
control and mutant P28 testes; 5030 mRNAs were expressed >8-fold differently across this
dataset or a dataset comparing testis to 21 other tissues including ovary; (Supplemental Fig.
5a). We calculated Pearson correlation coefficients for expression of these 5030 mRNAs in
mutant gonads relative to each tissue and found that the mutant gonad most closely
resembled ovary (Supplemental Fig. 5b; average R=0.75). Many mRNAs with decreased
expression in mutant gonads also were low in other tissues, likely reflecting a lack of male
germ cells, which comprise much of the testis mass. Also, some mRNAs elevated in mutant
gonads were elevated in other tissues. Therefore, to specifically evaluate ovary-enriched
mRNAs, we used bioGPS (biogps.gnf.org; SI) to identify 65 mRNAs with expression
closely correlated to Foxl2 and then compared their expression in ovary relative to the other
21 tissues (Fig. 3a; Supplemental Fig. 6). This comparison confirmed that these mRNAs are
highly ovary-enriched. About 40% were elevated in mutant gonads relative to control testes;
about 80% of the remainder were oocyte-enriched. Thus loss of Dmrt1 causes large changes
in mRNA expression, including induction of multiple ovary-enriched mRNAs. mRNA
profiling of Dmrt1 mutant gonads perinatally and at P9 did not reveal apparent
feminization17,18, consistent with the observation that FOXL2 expression starts at ~P14.

Author Manuscript

Further analysis of the mRNA profiling data identified highly elevated expression (>5-fold,
p<0.001) of many mRNAs expressed in granulosa cells and required for ovarian
development or function. These included Foxl2, Nr5a2/Lrh1, Wnt4, LH receptor (Lhcgr),
prolactin receptor (Prlr), FSH receptor (Fshr), follistatin (Fst), Sfrp4, Igfbp5, Inhbb, Inha,
and Lnfg (Supplemental Table 2). Foxl2os, a noncoding RNA transcribed from the opposite
strand of the Foxl2 coding region, also was highly over-expressed and has been suggested as
a positive regulator of Foxl219. We confirmed elevated expression in mutant gonads of
LRH1, a transcription factor expressed only in granulosa cells within the ovary20 and absent
from the testis (Supplemental Fig. 7a–f). Nr5a2/Lrh1 is likely a direct target of DMRT1
regulation, based on binding of DMRT1 to its promoter proximal sequences in vivo
(Supplemental Fig. 7g). Based on mRNA and protein expression data and changes in
cellular morphology, we conclude that loss of Dmrt1 in testes reprogrammes Sertoli cells
into granulosa cells.

Author Manuscript

Granulosa cells produce oestrogens, which are essential for ovarian development in many
vertebrates; in mammals oestrogen signaling also acts with FOXL2 to repress Sox9
transcription in adult granulosa cells2. HSD17β1 and CYP19A1/Aromatase are enzymes
critical for oestrogen synthesis, and mRNAs for both enzymes were elevated in mutant
gonads (Supplemental Fig. 8). Aromatase protein is robustly expressed in granulosa cells
and was strongly expressed in mutant gonads (Fig. 3b–d). Consistent with these enzyme
changes, oestradiol was elevated in serum of adult mutants relative to control adult males
(SI). Although expression of the androgenic enzyme Hsd17β3 was not affected in mutant
gonads (Supplemental Fig. 8), androgen levels were reduced based on severely decreased
seminal vesicle weight, a sensitive indicator of androgen activity (350 +/− 52 mg vs 182 +/−
36 mg; n = 3, P=0.01).
Theca cells are induced during follicle growth in the ovary, likely in response to granulosa
cell signals21, and together with granulosa cells and oocytes they comprise the functional

unit of the ovary. Because mutant gonads contained apparently functional granulosa cells,
we asked whether theca cells also formed. Theca cells have spindle-shaped nuclei and
express both FOXL2 and smooth muscle actin (SMA) (Fig. 3e). Adult mutant gonads
contained cells closely resembling theca cells and expressing both proteins (Fig. 3f). The
theca-like cells likely derive either from granulosa cells or peritubular myoid cells (which
also are elongated and express SMA; Figure 3g). However, since seminiferous tubule
integrity was lost prior to formation of these cells (Fig. 3f; Supplemental Fig. 9) they could
potentially derive from interstitial cells that invaded the tubule remnants. We also observed
intratubular cells strongly expressing the steroidogenic enzyme SCC (Fig. 3h–j); these cells
resembled luteinized granulosa cells of the ovary (Fig. 3h), suggesting that granulosa cells in
the mutant gonad are responsive to gonadotropins. We therefore tested the effect of
exogenous gonadotropin stimulation; treated mutants, but not controls, had additional
luteinized granulosa cells and germ cells with oocyte-like nuclear morphology that
expressed the oocyte-specific proteins MATER and ZP2 (Supplemental Fig. 10). This result
suggests that both somatic cells and germ cells are feminized in mutant gonads.

The preceding results indicate that DMRT1 is essential for postnatal sex maintenance.
DMRT1 is a sequence-specific transcriptional regulator, capable of activating or repressing
transcription of target genes18,22. To help find targets of DMRT1 regulation with potential
roles in sex maintenance we examined expression of known foetal sex-determining genes in
mutant gonads at P28 by qRT-PCR (Fig. 4a). Among masculinizing genes, Ptgdr, Sox9, and
Sox8, which acts redundantly with Sox923,24, were reduced. Among feminizing genes,
Foxl2, Esr1, Esr2, Wnt4 and Rspo1 were elevated. We assayed binding of DMRT1 to DNA
of P28 testes by quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (qChIP), guided by genomewide ChIP data from P9 testes (ChIP-chip18 and ChIP-seq [unpublished]). DMRT1 bound
both upstream and downstream of Sox9 and upstream of Sox8, and bound weakly near
Ptgdr. DMRT1 bound strongly near Foxl2, Esr1, Esr2, Wnt4 and Rspo1 (Fig. 4b). All of the
DMRT1-associated regions contained at least one close match to the DMRT1 DNA binding
consensus18,22.

Author Manuscript

Based on mRNA and protein expression data and ChIP analysis, we propose a model for
postnatal sex maintenance (Fig. 4b) in which DMRT1 maintains male fates by repressing
multiple female-promoting genes and activating male-promoting genes. Sox9 is dispensable
for testis differentiation after sex determination24,25, suggesting that other critical male
regulators remain to be found; Sox8 is a clear candidate based on its redundancy with
Sox923,24. We find that DMRT1 represses Foxl2, which is known to maintain postnatal
ovarian fate. FOXL2 also represses Dmrt12; thus antagonism between these sex-specific
transcriptional regulators may be central to sex maintenance in both sexes throughout
reproductive life. Wnt4 and Rspo1 also are prime candidates for postnatal sex maintenance
based on their requirement in ovarian determination in the foetus26,27. Indeed, P28 mutant
gonads had elevated nuclear β-Catenin in somatic cells, as in ovaries, but control testes did
not, indicating active Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the mutant gonads (Supplemental Fig. 11).
Functional analysis of Wnt4, Rspo1 and other known foetal sex regulators will be important
to establish their roles in sex maintenance. The analysis presented here demonstrates that
deletion of Dmrt1 during foetal development induces postnatal feminization of the testis,

causing male-to-female primary sex reversal. Moreover, deletion of Dmrt1 in adults can
reprogramme differentiated Sertoli cells into apparent granulosa cells. Why are Dmrt1
mutants feminized only after birth? Another male-promoting gene may act redundantly with
Dmrt1 prior to P14, masking its function; alternatively, the testis may lack potential
feminizing activity from genes such as Foxl2 prior to P14. Why are Dmrt1 mutant mice born
male, whereas human 9p deletions removing DMRT1 can cause XY feminization at birth?
The human sex reversal may reflect failure to maintain male sex determination, and the
longer human gestation may permit testis-to-ovary reprogramming before birth.
Alternatively, human testes may have potential feminizing activity earlier or may lack
masculinizing genes redundant with DMRT1. Our results may provide insights into the
aetiology of human gonadal disorders, including gonadoblastoma and granulosa cell tumors
of the testis. Moreover, because many genes implicated in this study are evolutionarily
conserved, similar mechanisms may control adult sex-switching in fish and may maintain
sexual fate in the adult gonads of other vertebrates or even in other phyla.

mRNA expression profiling and data analysis were performed as described13 except total
testis RNA was isolated from 4-week-old animals using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen
#15596-026). Affymetrix Mouse Genome 439 2.0 arrays were normalized by GC-RMA
normalization28 using GeneData Refiner. The Raw .cel files and the normalized data are
deposited in GEO29 as GSE27261. GSE9954 was obtained from the GEO database. The

Each experiment in our dataset was divided by the average expression value from control
testis tissue. GSE9954 data were separately divided by the average signal obtained from the
GSE9954 testis samples. This was done separately for each dataset to determine how
samples from each dataset differed from a baseline “testis” expression state. Cluster 3.0
software30 was used to: i) log base 2 transform the data; ii) filter the dataset for genes that
showed at least three observations with abs(val) >= 3 (8-fold) which resulted in 5030 genes
passing the filter using both datasets combined; and iii) cluster the data on the gene-axis
using average linkage hierarchial clustering. The experimental axis was defined by order of
decreasing correlation to the mutant testes calculated as described above. Javatreeview
Software31 was used to generate heatmap images.
qRT-PCR

Figure 1. DMRT1 maintains SOX9 and suppresses FOXL2 expression in postnatal Sertoli cells

Author Manuscript

(a–c) FOXL2 expression detected by immunofluorescence (IF) in adult granulosa and theca
cells of control ovary (a) and intratubular cells of Dmrt1 null testis at postnatal day 28 (P28)
(b) but not in control testis (c). (d–f) FOXL2 is robustly expressed when Dmrt1 is mutated
in foetal Sertoli cells with Dhh-cre (d) or Sf1-cre (e) but not when Dmrt1 is mutated in foetal
germ cells with Nanos3-cre (f). (g–o) Timing of FOXL2 expression. FOXL2 is absent from
control testis at P14 (g–i). Cells expressing FOXL2 or FOXL2 and SOX9 (arrowheads) are
present in SCDmrt1KO testis at P14 (j–l). FOXL2-positive cells are abundant in
SCDmrt1KO testis at P28 and most cells no longer express SOX9 (m–o). Scale bars: 20 mm.

Figure 2. Sertoli-to-granulosa transdifferentiation in the adult testis

Expression of FOXL2 and SOX9 one month after tamoxifen injection into Dmrt1flox/flox
adult males (8 weeks and older) carrying inducible ubiquitous cre transgene UBC-cre/ERT2.
(a,b) Sertoli cells in control testis express SOX9 but not FOXL2. (c–f) Mutant testis has
Sertoli-like cells expressing SOX9 or SOX9 and FOXL2 (inset, d) and granulosa-like cells
expressing only FOXL2 (inset, f). (g,h) FOXL2-positive cells in control ovary have DAPI
morphology similar to FOXL2 single-positive cells of mutant testis. FOXL2-positive cells in
mutant testis resemble granulosa cells: they lack the tripartite nucleoli of Sertoli cells, have
smaller and more rounded nuclei, and have more punctate DAPI staining. UBC-cre/ERT2
also deletes Dmrt1 in germ cells, causing precocious meiosis12; after one month germ cells
are nearly absent. Scale bars: 20 μm.

Figure 3. Feminization of SCDmrt1KO XY gonads

Author Manuscript

(a) Expression of ovary-enriched mRNAs with expression profiles similar to Foxl2 (see SI).
mRNAs labeled “somatic” were enriched in ovarian somatic cells; those labeled “oocyte”
were enriched in female germ cells. See Supplemental Fig. 6 for higher resolution image.
(b–d) IHC detection of CYP19A1/Aromatase expression in follicles of control adult ovary
(a) and in adult XY SCDmrt1KO gonad (b) but only in interstitial Leydig cells of control
testis (c). Arrows indicate Aromatase-positive granulosa cells in ovary and mutant gonad
and negative Sertoli cell in control testis. Scale bars: 50 μm. (e–g) IF detection of smooth
muscle actin (SMA) and FOXL2. Ovarian theca cells (inset, e) are elongated cells
expressing both proteins; similar cells are present in mutant gonads (f); peritubular myoid
cells in control testes express SMA and not FOXL2 (g). Scale bars: 20 μm. (h–j) IF
detection of cells coexpressing FOXL2 in the nucleus and steroidogenic enzyme
CYP11A1/SCC at high levels in the cytoplasm in control ovary (h) and XY Dmrt1KO
gonads (i). SCC-positive cells in control testis (j) are interstitial Leydig cells. Mutant gonads
were SCDmrt1KO(Dhh). Ad.=adult. Scale bars: 20μm.

Figure 4. DMRT1 regulation of postnatal gene expression

Author Manuscript

(a) qRT-PCR analysis of sex-determining genes at P28. Significance of expression changes
is indicated (Students t-test). Mutant gonads were SCDmrt1KO(Sf1); SCDmrt1KO(Dhh)
mutant gonads and equivalent expression changes. (b) qChIP analysis of DMRT1 DNA
binding in P28 testes. Significance of enrichment relative to B2m (Students t-test) is shown.
(c) Model for regulation by postnatal sex maintenance by DMRT1. Proposed direct
regulation based on ChIP and mRNA expression data is indicated by solid lines; indirect or
potential regulation is indicated by dashed lines. (Model adapted from Veitia2).
