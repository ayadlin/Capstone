BACKGROUND: The efficacy of afatinib, an irreversible ErbB Family Blocker, was evaluated in patients who had 1 of 4 categories of
solid tumors with epidermal growth factor receptor/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (EGFR/HER2) gene amplification or
EGFR-activating mutations. METHODS: Patients with previously treated but ErbB inhibitor-naive esophagogastric, biliary tract, urothelial tract, or gynecologic cancers (lung cancers were excluded) harboring EGFR/HER2 gene amplification or high polysomy were
identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Tumors were also screened for EGFR mutations. The primary endpoint was the
objective response rate; secondary endpoints included the clinical benefit rate, pharmacokinetics, and safety. RESULTS: Of 385 prescreened patients, 38 had FISH-positive tumors (10 with EGFR amplification and 29 with HER2 amplification or high polysomy [1 tumor had EGFR/HER2 high polysomy]; none had EGFR-activating mutations), and 20 patients received treatment with afatinib 50 mg
daily. The objective response rate was 5% (1 of 20 patients), and the best objective response included 1 complete response. Eight
patients experienced stable disease. The most frequently reported adverse events were diarrhea, rash, and decreased appetite. The
trial closed early because of slow recruitment. CONCLUSIONS: Single-agent afatinib activity was limited, yet encouraging, in selected
tumors that were screened prospectively for target activation. The implementation of a biomarker-driven approach using a low-freC 2013 American

INTRODUCTION
Dysregulation of the ErbB Family has been observed in numerous malignancies, making this signaling pathway an attractive therapeutic target.1 The ErbB (erythroblastic leukemia viral [v-erb-b] oncogene homolog) receptor Family comprises
4 structurally related, membrane-bound receptors: epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB1), human epidermal
growth factor receptor (HER2/ErbB2), ErbB3 (HER3), and ErbB4 (HER4).2 In cancers that depend on a single signaling
pathway for survival and growth, commonly termed “oncogene addiction,”3 targeted inhibition of the signaling pathway
can lead to tumor death. In a growing number of tumors, oncogene addiction has been observed in the setting of a dysregulated ErbB signaling pathway. For instance, activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR occur in a subset of nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), and inhibition of these oncogenic drivers with EGFR inhibitors, such as
gefitinib and erlotinib, has produced dramatic responses.4-10 EGFR or HER2 gene amplification also has been identified
as an oncogenic driver in a variety of tumor histologies, which are sensitive to EGFR or HER2 inhibition.11-14

Afatinib (BIBW 2992) is a potent, orally bioavailable
ErbB Family Blocker that irreversibly blocks the signaling
from EGFR/HER1 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration
[IC50], 0.5 nM), HER2 (IC50, 14 nM), and ErbB4 (IC50, 1
nM) tyrosine kinases and transphosphorylation of ErbB3.15,16
In vitro, afatinib suppresses the cellular kinase activity of wildtype and activated EGFR and HER2 mutants, including erlotinib-resistant isoforms.15 Afatinib also has demonstrated preclinical activity across a range of ErbB-driven, in vivo cancer
models.15,17 Preclinical data suggested that afatinib has the
potential to benefit patients with tumors driven by the ErbB
pathway regardless of histology, which prompted a study
design based on tumor molecular characteristics rather than
the primary site of origin. Such biomarker-driven patient
recruitment has been used successfully in trials of other targeted cancer therapies.18-20 For the current phase 2, openlabel, exploratory trial, we evaluated the efficacy of afatinib in
patients most likely to benefit from ErbB Family blockade
who were prospectively screened for EGFR/HER2 gene amplification or EGFR-activating mutations.

for EGFR/HER2 gene amplification or EGFR-activating
mutations. It was conducted in 17 centers (14 in the
United States and 3 in Taiwan) between November 2008
and November 2010. The study design, which involved a
2-step consent process, is illustrated in Figure 1. Patients’
tumors were required to have documented gene amplification before patients received afatinib treatment; therefore,
genetic prescreening of archived tumor samples comprised fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing
for EGFR and HER2 amplification, which was performed
by a central laboratory (Massachusetts General Hospital,
Boston, Mass). Patients who had FISH-positive tumors
provided written consent for further screening for suitability and, if they were eligible, afatinib treatment. Given
the known sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors, patients who
harbored externally documented, known EGFR-activating
mutations also were allowed to enroll in the trial. The
study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki, local laws, and the International Conference
on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines,
and it was approved by the relevant regulatory and independent ethics committees or institutional review boards.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design

Study Population

This was a multicenter, phase 2, open-label trial in
patients whose tumors had been genetically prescreened

Eligible patients aged 18 years required a histologically
confirmed diagnosis of advanced cancer of 1 of either:

category 1 (gastric, gastroesophageal junction, or esophageal cancer), category 2 (biliary or gallbladder cancer), category 3 (transitional cell carcinoma [TCC] of the
urothelial tract), or category 4 (gynecologic cancers). Other
key eligibility criteria included measurable disease according
to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version
1.0 (RECIST 1.0), life expectancy 3 months, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score from
0 to 2. All patients had to have progressed after 1 line of
prior chemotherapy and were excluded if they had received
previous treatment with gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib, or
other EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Patients
were required to have tumors with EGFR or HER2 gene
amplification or tumors that harbored known activating
EGFR mutations. However, the protocol was amended later
to also allow patients who had tumors with high EGFR/
HER2 polysomy (4 gene copies in 40% of cells), as
determined by FISH, to enter the study. The rationale for
including patients who had high EGFR/HER2 polysomy
was that multiple gene copies result in higher protein expression, which may be amenable to EGFR inhibition.
Tumor Genetic Testing

Tumor samples were screened for molecular genetic
abnormalities by FISH; and individual cell EGFR, HER2,
and centromeric probe 7 (CEP7) (the reference probe) signals were recorded. FISH-positive tumors had either
high-level amplification (numerous loose or tight clusters
of EGFR/HER2 signals, or atypically large signals, or an
EGFR or HER2/CEP7 ratio >5.0) or low-level amplification (EGFR or HER2/CEP7 ratio >2.2 and <5.0). After a
protocol amendment, tumors that had 4 gene copies of
EGFR or HER2 in 40% of cells (high polysomy) were
considered FISH-positive. EGFR and v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten
rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutation
analyses (KRAS exon 2 mutations at codons 12 and 13
and EGFR mutations, including exon 19 deletions, exon
20 insertions, and the mutations G719X, T790M,
L858R, and L861Q) were performed retrospectively on
eligible tumor samples using a high-sensitivity, allele-specific mutation-detection assay (SNaPshot Multiplex Kit;
Applied Biosystems/Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif).
Treatment

Patients received afatinib 50 mg daily administered orally
or through a gastrostomy tube in 28-day cycles until they
developed either disease progression or undue adverse
events (AEs). Two dose reductions to 40 mg daily and, if
deemed necessary, subsequently to 30 mg daily were perCancer

August 15, 2013

mitted in patients who experienced certain AEs; further
dose reductions were not allowed.
Assessments

The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR;
complete response [CR] or partial response [PR] according
to RECIST 1.0 criteria). Imaging assessments for tumor
response were performed at 6 weeks and at 12 weeks and
then every 8 weeks until treatment completion. Secondary
efficacy endpoints included the clinical benefit rate (CR,
PR, or stable disease according to RECIST 1.0 criteria) and
progression-free survival (PFS). Safety assessments encompassed the occurrence and intensity of diarrhea, skin rash,
AEs resulting in dose reduction or treatment discontinuation, and the incidence of other AEs according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0.
Pharmacokinetics

Plasma samples were collected during Cycle 1 on Days 1 and
15 (before drug administration), during Cycle 2 on Days 1
(1, 3, and 6 [2 patients] hours after drug administration) and
15 (before drug administration), during Cycle 3 on Day 1
(before and 2 hours after drug administration), and during
Cycle 4 on Day 1 (before drug administration). Afatinib
plasma concentrations were analyzed by validated high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry
at Boehringer Ingelheim (Biberach, Germany).21,22
Sample Size Determination and Statistical
Methods

The sample size was based on the assumption that the
underlying response rate for the selected patient population
would be 20%. Sample size calculations also met the
requirement for the exact 90% confidence interval (CI) to
rule out a 10% response rate if the true response rate was
20%. The recommended total sample size was 48
patients, with 12 patients in each of the 4 tumor categories;
10 responders were required overall to meet study assumptions. The planned primary analysis was to estimate the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response. An
exact 90% Clopper-Pearson CI was to be calculated for this
estimate for the overall population and for each tumor category. Because of early study termination, only data on the
primary efficacy endpoint were summarized; no CIs were
produced, and efficacy and safety results were presented for
the overall population rather than by tumor category.

FISH status was determined by the central laboratory.
b
FISH positive indicates either EGFR or HER2 amplification, or EGFR or HER2 high polysomy.

Table 1. Of the 38 patients who had FISH-positive
tumors identified by central laboratory testing, 10 tumors
tested positive for EGFR amplification/high polysomy (6
esophagogastric tumors, 4 urothelial TCCs), and 29 had
HER2 amplification/high polysomy (17 esophagogastric
tumors, 5 biliary tract tumors, 3 urothelial TCCs, and 4
gynecologic tumors). One of the urothelial TCCs mentioned above tested positive for EGFR and HER2 high
polysomy. Twenty eligible patients received 1 afatinib
dose (Table 2); none had tumors with EGFR-activating
mutations. Among those 20 patients, 4 had EGFR-amplified tumors (3 with high-level amplification and 1 with
low-level amplification), and 13 tumors were positive for
HER2 amplification (10 with high-level amplification
and 3 with low-level amplification). Two tumors had
high polysomy (EGFR, n 5 1; EGFR and HER2, n 5 1).
In the same group of 20 patients, 1 had a tumor that was
positive for EGFR amplification and high polysomy.
Locally confirmed FISH-positive results could not be confirmed subsequently by central laboratory testing in 2
patients. This study was terminated early because of
recruitment challenges; no safety or efficacy findings
influenced that decision.
Antitumor Activity

The 20 patients who received 1 dose of afatinib were
included in the efficacy assessment. Responses are summarized in Table 3, and EGFR/HER2 status is also presented. The ORR for afatinib was 5% (1 of 20 patients) in
3046

this previously treated but ErbB TKI-naive population.
There were no PRs; however, 1 patient achieved a CR.
This patient was an Asian woman aged 64 years with stage
IV endometrial carcinoma whose tumor was FISH-positive for high-level HER2 and FISH-negative for EGFR
amplification (no EGFR or KRAS mutations were
detected); prior therapies included palliative chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin. The PFS in this
patient was censored at 252 days, which was the last available tumor assessment. Eight patients (40%) had stable
disease as their best response, and the clinical benefit rate
was 45% (9 of 20 patients). Figure 2 depicts a waterfall
plot of data from imaging analyses in the 17 patients who
had evaluable RECIST data. Approximately 50% of
patients had a decrease in tumor size (in terms of the maximum decrease in any 1 dimension, based on sums of the
greatest dimensions, collected as part of the RECIST
assessment), although the change was small in most
patients.
Safety

Overall, the median treatment duration was 83.5 days
(range, 9-237 days). The most common reason for treatment discontinuation was disease progression (n 5 15;
75%), followed by drug-related AE (n 5 2; 10%), other
AE, patient refusal to continue with drug, and other reason (n 5 1 each; 5% each). All patients reported 1 AE,
most commonly diarrhea, rash, and decreased appetite
(Table 4). Drug-related AEs were reported in 19 of 20

patients. Twelve grade 3 treatment-related events were
reported in 9 of 20 patients (45%), including diarrhea
(n 5 4), dermatitis acneiform (n 5 1), fatigue (n 5 3),
decreased weight (n 5 1), paronychia (n 5 2), and
decreased appetite (n 5 1). Eight patients required dose
reductions because of AEs. All drug-related grade 3 AEs
resolved after dose reduction (n 5 6) or drug discontinuation (n 5 2), except for paronychia (n 5 1), decreased
appetite (n 5 1), and fatigue (n 5 2). Serious AEs (SAEs)
were reported in 6 patients, possibly related to treatment
in 2 patients. One patient with metastatic bladder cancer
experienced grade 5 dyspnea possibly related to afatinib.
That patient had multiple comorbidities, including a history of deep vein thrombosis; workup revealed a lowprobability ventilation-perfusion scan for pulmonary embolism with no significant pulmonary infiltrate. This
patient subsequently died. Autopsy revealed extensive disease progression, including microscopic pulmonary tumor emboli. The second SAEs possibly related to afatinib
were grade 3 diarrhea and grade 2 dehydration, which
required hospitalization in a patient with gallbladder
carcinoma. Five patients discontinued trial medication
because of AEs; 3 discontinuations were attributed to the
treatment (hematuria [n 5 1], fatigue, increased creatinine, hyperbilirubinemia, and increased aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels [n 5 1], and
weight loss [n 5 1]).
Pharmacokinetics

In 12 evaluable patients, steady-state afatinib levels
were reached at the latest by Day 15, and predose
plasma concentrations appeared stable over the
observed treatment periods (Table 5). Overall variability of predose plasma concentrations was moderate to
high, with a geometric coefficient of variation (gCV)
from 65.1% to 82.3%. On Day 1 of Cycle 2, afatinib plasma concentrations increased in the first 3
hours after initial administration of afatinib 50 mg,
with geometric mean (gMean) values of 42.4 ng/mL
(range, 18.5-117 ng/mL) at 1 hour and 53.4 ng/mL
(range, 24.3-95.2 ng/mL) at 3 hours.
DISCUSSION
This was a phase 2, open-label, exploratory trial of afatinib
in patients with previously treated solid tumors that were
screened prospectively for EGFR or HER2 gene amplification. The underlying rationale was that determinants of
sensitivity to targeted agents may be genetic rather than
histologic; however, the trial was designed to include 4
specific tumor categories (gastric, gastroesophageal

EGFR-activating mutations was consistent with earlier
studies.27,28
There was evidence of antitumor activity in this heavily treated, but ErbB TKI-naive, population. One patient
with endometrial cancer and high-level HER2 amplification
achieved a CR. It is noteworthy that no responses were
observed in a phase 2 trial of trastuzumab in patients with
HER2-overexpressed or HER2-amplified endometrial cancers,29 suggesting possible differences between antibodies
and TKIs in this setting. With afatinib treatment, 8 of 20
patients experienced a best response of stable disease, suggesting modest single-agent activity in patients with other
ErbB-driven tumors. Although the response rates appear to
be low in this broad patient population, the results need to
be interpreted with caution in light of the limited sample
size. In select patients, afatinib therapy may improve outcomes, as previously reported.9,10,30 The observed AE and
pharmacokinetic profiles for afatinib were consistent with
previous studies.21,30,31 The most frequently reported AEs
included diarrhea and rash.
Single-agent therapy with afatinib in this small, pretreated patient population that was selected for EGFR/
HER2 gene amplification demonstrated a low ORR (5%).
However, the small sample size because of the early trial
termination and the low patient numbers by tumor category meant that the study objectives could not be fully
assessed, and interpretation of the findings was difficult.
Factors potentially influencing the low response rate
include the possibility that gene amplification does not
act as the sole oncogenic driver in the included tumor
types. EGFR mutations are drivers in subsets of NSCLCs,
and, it was reported recently that HER2 mutations confer
sensitivity to afatinib in NSCLC.32 However, EGFR
mutations were not identified in our population, and the
prospective identification of HER2 mutations was not an
eligibility criterion. The HER2 mutation status of the
patient with an endometrial tumor who experienced a CR

is unknown. Another explanation for low response rates
in the setting of gene amplification is that resistance
mechanisms are recruited so readily that the roles of ErbB
signaling and targeted inhibition are masked. The role of
polysomy in oncogenic signaling remains unclear, because
only 3 patients with polysomy were recruited.
The development and evaluation of a biomarker
within a single study of multiple tumor types represents a
further level of complexity over studies evaluating a single
biomarker within 1 tumor type, because each biomarker
may have a different impact or weight on clinical outcomes.
For instance, although BRAF V600E mutations predict a
dramatic benefit with vemurafenib in patients with melanoma, the drug has demonstrated only modest activity in
colorectal cancers with BRAF V600E mutations. Nonetheless, although exploratory studies are important for testing
clinical scientific hypotheses, small sample sizes and the absence of control treatment arms limit the predictive value of
the biomarker in question unless drug activity with respect
to the biomarker is dramatic. In such cases, the use of biomarker-related eligibility criteria may allow for a “signal”
that could be lost or delayed in an unselected study design.
Prescreening as part of our trial design was a major
challenge to patient recruitment, and only 20 patients
received afatinib rather than the planned 12 patients per
category (48 patients in all). Prescreening the desired
number of patient tumors for uncommon genetic lesions
relies on oncologists to refer patients for screening, the
coordination of which is particularly challenging when
multiple cancer types are involved within 1 trial. This obstacle may be obviated in the future as genetic screening
across tumor types for multiple molecular lesions becomes
standard clinical practice.
In conclusion, the single-agent activity of afatinib in
this small trial was limited, yet encouraging, in selected
patients with manageable tolerability. The trial was terminated early because of the difficulty in recruiting sufficient
patients within the prespecified timeframe. The implementation of a biomarker-driven approach for patient
selection in this setting was challenging, and alternative
models for such a setting are needed for the future.
