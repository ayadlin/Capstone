ABSTRACT
Accumulated evidence suggests that M2-like polarized tumor associated
macrophages (TAMs) plays an important role in cancer progression and metastasis,
establishing TAMs, especially M2-like TAMs as an appealing target for therapy
intervention. Here we found that metformin significantly suppressed IL-13 induced
M2-like polarization of macrophages, as illustrated by reduced expression of CD206,
down-regulation of M2 marker mRNAs, and inhibition of M2-like macrophages promoted
migration of cancer cells and endothelial cells. Metformin triggered AMPKα1 activation
in macrophage and silencing of AMPKα1 partially abrogated the inhibitory effect of
metformin in IL-13 induced M2-like polarization. Administration of AICAR, another
activator of AMPK, also blocked the M2-like polarization of macrophages. Metformin
greatly reduced the number of metastases of Lewis lung cancer without affecting tumor
growth. In tumor tissues, the percentage of M2-like macrophage was decreased and
the area of pericyte-coated vessels was increased. Further, the anti-metastatic effect of
metformin was abolished when the animals were treated with macrophages eliminating
agent clodronate liposome. These findings suggest that metformin is able to block
the M2-like polarization of macrophages partially through AMPKα1, which plays an
important role in metformin inhibited metastasis of Lewis lung cancer.

teratocarcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and prostate tumor
graft models [6, 12–14].
Because plasticity and flexibility are key features of
macrophages and their activation sates, whether TAMs
execute tumor-preventing or tumor-promoting role depends
on their polarization statues [15, 16]. Macrophage activation
is broadly categorized as classically activated, or M1,
and alternatively activated, or M2. In nonmalignant or
regressing tumors, the majority of TAMs is classic activated
macrophages (M1-like), representing pro-inflammatory
activity, presenting antigen and promoting tumor lysis. On
the contrary, TAMs in malignant tumors tend to resemble
alternatively activated macrophages (M2-like), which
enhance tumor-associated angiogenesis, promote the ability
of tumor migration and invasion, as well as suppress the
antitumor immune responses. Thus, M2-like TAMs are
considered to be a potential targets for adjuvant anticancer
therapies and recent therapeutic approaches targeting M2like TAM have gained encouraging results. For example,

INTRODUCTION
Macrophages are a major cellular component of
murine and human tumors, where they are commonly
termed tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Although
the original hypotheses proposed that TAMs are involved
in anti-tumor immunity, recent clinical and experimental
evidences show tumor-promoting effect of TAMs in
various cancers [1–4]. Epidemiological studies indicate
a strong association between increased macrophage
infiltration and poor prognosis and in ovarian, cervical,
thyroid, lung, hepatocellular cancers, and breast cancers
[5–9]. Analysis of the transcriptome of TAMs derived
from mouse models of breast cancer has also provided
evidence that enrichment in macrophage transcripts
is predictive of poor prognosis and reduced survival
in human breast cancer [10, 11]. Specific depletion of
macrophages using clodronate-encapsulated liposomes
reduces growth in melanoma, ovarian, Lewis lung,

targeted delivery of peptide to M2-like TAM improves
survival of tumor bearing mouse [17]. Inhibition of CSF-1
receptor, which is essential for macrophage differentiation,
significantly increased survival and suppressed established
tumors, accompanied by decreased M2-like TAM [18].
Furthermore, by skewing TAM polarization away from
the M2- to M1-like phenotype, HRG promotes antitumor
immune responses and vessel normalization, decreases tumor
growth and metastasis and enhances chemotherapy [4].
Metformin, used to be the anti-diabetic drug, is
associated with decreasing cancer incidence or cancerrelated mortality in diabetic patients in a compelling
evidence [19–21]. Because of its excellent safety in
diabetes patients, the clinical evaluation of metformin
for its chemo-preventive and anti-neoplastic effects has
bypassed the traditional phase I assessment and has directly
moved forward to phase II and phase III trials in several
cancers [22, 23]. Extensive studies have been carried out
to declare the underlying mechanism for the beneficial
role of metformin in cancer. Metformin mediated AMPK
activation leads to an inhibition of mTOR signaling, a
reduction in phosphorylation of its major down-stream
effectors, the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding
proteins (4E-BPs) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase
(SK6Ks), and an inhibition of global protein synthesis and
proliferation in a number of different cancer cell lines [24].
Recent studies have demonstrated that metformin may also
target cancer-initiating cells [25] or repress the process of
epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) [26]. However,
the published studies which focused on inhibition of cell
proliferation or induction of cell apoptosis, are not able to
fully explain the beneficial effect of metformin in cancer.
Given that M2-like macrophages are greatly
involved in cancer metastasis, we investigated the
relevance between macrophage polarization and the
antitumor effect of metformin. Here we showed that
metformin, from 0.5 to 2.0 mM, efficiently skewed
macrophages away from M2 polarization induced by
IL-13. We also found that the metformin inhibits
metastasis of Lewis lung cancer (LLC) in vivo, and this
effect was abolished in macrophage eliminated system.
Our study suggests that the inhibition of M2 polarization
of TAMs may contribute to metformin reduced cancer
incidence and cancer-related morality.

of macrophages. As shown in Figure 1A, significant upregulation of CD206 were observed when RAW264.7
were treated with 10 ng/ml IL-13 for 72 h, which was
greatly reduced by 1.0 mM metformin. Similarly, IL-13
induced CD206 expression in BMDMs was reduced in a
concentration-dependent manner (Figure 1B). To further
confirm the role of metformin in M2-like polarization,
transcription changes were assessed by real-time PCR.
M2 marker genes, including MRC1, PPARγ, CCL24,
CCR2, chil3, Mgl2, Retnla, and Arg1, were decreased
by 1 mM metformin compared with IL-13 treated group,
while M1-like genes was not effected (Figure 1C and 1D).
These results suggested that metformin effectively inhibited
M2-like polarization of macrophage in vitro. Moreover,
metformin inhibited PMA induced M2-like shift of THP-1
as indicated by reduced expression of CD206 and mRNA
expression of MRC1 and dectin (Supplementary Figure S2).

Metformin eliminates migration-promoting
feature of M2-like macrophages
Given the capacity of M2-like macrophage to promote
cancer metastasis, we investigated the impact of metformin
on the functional macrophage-tumor cell interaction.
Macrophages were treated with IL-13, metformin, or both
of them for 72 h, and the culture medium were replaced
by fresh medium without serum, 24 h later the supernatant
medium was collected as CM. To exclude the impact of
CM on tumor cell survival, LLC cells were treated with
the conditioned medium for 24 h and cell proliferation and
apoptosis were analyzed. No significant difference was
found in four groups (Figure 2A and 2B). CM from IL-13
treated macrophages significantly promoted migration of
LLC cells in 24 h, whereas CM from combined treatment of
IL-13 and metformin didn’t have this effect, nor did the CM
from metformin treated macrophage (Figure 2C). Further,
the expression of metastasis-related genes in macrophage
with IL-13 stimulation was intensely increased, while 1 mM
metformin partially blocked this increase (Figure 2D).

Metformin inhibits angiogenesis-promoting
phenotype of M2-like macrophages
There is a growing appreciation that M2-like
macrophages tend to be angiogenesis-promoting phenotype,
therefore we analyzed the effect of metformin on the
angiogenesis-promoting feature of macrophages. CM was
obtained in the same way as above and we evaluated
the migrating ability of MMVECs in different CM by
using wound-healing assay and migration assay. The
purified MMVECs were confirmed by FACs analysis by
CD31staining (Supplementary Figure S3). MMVECs were
treated with CM for 24 h and no significant difference in cell
survival was found (Figure 3A). Both wound healing and
trans-well assay revealed that CM from IL-13 challenged
macrophages promoted MMVECs migration, which was
abrogated by metformin (Figure 3B and 3C). Further, CM

major subunit expressed in macrophages, we analyzed the
phosphorylation level of AMPKα1 during the polarization
process with or without metformin. In RAW264.7 and
BMDMs, IL-13 treatment didn’t affect AMPKα1 or
phosphorylated AMPKα1 in 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 72 h.
Whereas, metformin triggered a significant AMPKα1
phosphorylation in 4 h, which remained elevated in 24, 48,
and 72 h (Figure 4A). Further, the effect of metformin in M2like polarization inhibition was abolished when AMPKα1
was silenced (Figure 4C and 4D). AIRCA, another AMPK
activator, was found to prevent the M2-like polarization
stimulated by IL-13 as also (Figure 4B). Taken together,
these results suggested that activation of AMPKα1 played an
important role in metformin inhibited M2-like polarization.

from metformin treated mice (Figure 6C and 6D).

DISCUSSION
In recent studies, it is reported that metformin could
block the invasion and metastasis in several types of
cancers, including endometrial carcinoma, ovarian cancer,
melanoma and breast cancer. Huang YP et al reported that
metformin blocked migration and invasion of tumor cells
by inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) [29].
Michael C et al. reported that the inhibition of cell invasion
by metformin was correlated with modulation of expression
of proteins involved in epithelial mesenchymal transition
such as Slug, Snail, SPARC, fibronectin and N-Cadherin
[30]. Several studies also showed that metformin is able
to inhibit angiogenesis in different model. Katiuscia D
et al. reported that metformin may inhibit angiogenesis
in vitro and in vivo by directly targeting endothelial cells
[31]. A very recent study showed that metformin inhibited
angiogenesis and metastatic growth of breast cancer
in vivo [32]. However, the mechanisms of action by which
metformin inhibits cancer invasion and metastasis are not
fully understood. Here, we found that metformin efficiently
suppressed the metastasis of LLCs in vivo, while this effect
was abolished in macrophage depletion model. In Algire
C’s study, subcutaneous LLC model was used to analyze
the inhibitory effect of metformin on tumor growth. They
observed that metformin treatment significantly decrease
tumor growth rate and tumor size in mice on the highenergy diet. However, there was no statistically significant
effect of metformin on tumor growth in those mice on the
control diet [33]. Similarly, we also didn’t find significant
inhibitory effect of metformin on tumor growth. Since a
large number of evidence has proved that macrophages in
the micro-environment of cancer, especially M2-like TAMs,
stimulate angiogenesis, enhance tumor cell migration and
invasion, our results established the relevance between
macrophage and the anti-metastasis effect of metformin,
suggesting that the anti-metastasis effect of metformin could
at least be partially attributed to its role in the inhibition of
TAM polarization.
In the present study we showed for the first time
that metformin could skew macrophages away from
M2 polarization in vivo and in vitro, which contributed
to metformin inhibited lung metastasis of LLC cells.
Further, we also demonstrated that AMPKα1 was
involved in metformin prevented M2-polarization
of macrophages. This finding provides a new sight in
the understanding the benefit of metformin in cancer
therapy.
Several studies have reported the impact of metformin
on biological functions of macrophages. Metformin inhibited
IL-1 induced release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6
and IL-8 in macrophages [34]. Metformin inhibits HMGB1

Metformin inhibits metastasis of LLC in vivo by
targeting macrophages
To evaluate the impact of metformin in vivo, we
analyzed the impact of metformin in tumor growth and
metastasis of LLC. While the growth of primary tumors
after subcutaneous injection of LLC was indistinguishable
between control and metformin treated mice (Figure 5D
and 5E), the number of metastasis was strongly reduced in
metformin group (Figure 5A and 5B). Further, the number
of metastasis was not affected by metformin when LLC
cells were injected intravenously (i.v.) (Figure 5F and 5G),
suggesting the decreased metastasis was attributable to
reduced escape from the primary tumor.
To investigate whether TAM played an important
role in metformin inhibited tumor metastasis, we treated the
tumor-bearing mice with clodronate liposome to eliminate
TAMs chemically (Supplementary Figure S4A). Consistent
with previous studies, lung metastasis of LLC was greatly
reduced in the depletion of TAMs and treatment of metformin
did not further affect metastasis under the elimination of
TAMs (Figure 5A and 5B). In addition, either treatment with
metformin or clodronate liposome had no effect in tumor
volume, tumor weight, and body weight (Figure 5D, 5E, and
Supplementary Figure S4B). Representative HE staining of
metastasis nude in lung was shown in Figure 5C.
We then investigated if metformin altered TAM
polarization in tumor tissues. Compared to control, no significant
difference in F4/80+ TAMs accumulation was observed in
tumors treated with metformin. Whereas, metformin affect
TAM polarization, as less F4/80+ TAMs expressed CD206 in
metformin treated tumors (Figure 6A and 6B).
Since the status of tumor vessels contributes
to tumor metastasis, we also analyzed the impact of
metformin in vessels density and maturation. CD31
staining revealed that tumor vessel density and vessel
area were comparable in tumors treated with or without
metformin. Coverage of endothelial cells by mural cells
renders vessels more mature, tight, and stable and reduces
tumor cell intravasation. Double staining of CD31 and the
mural marker α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) revealed

survival rate of endotoxaemic mice [35]. A very recent study
showed that metformin exhibits anti-inflammatory action in
LPS- activated macrophages via ATF-3 induction [36]. By
the employment of IL-13 induced M2 polarization model,
we found that metformin was able to inhibit IL-13 induced
expression of M2 marker (CD206) and M2 marker mRNA

(MRC1, Arg1, Retnla). Considering that in most case, the

published patterns associated with these M1/M2 designations,
we further analyzed the function phenotype of macrophages.

promoted migration of LLC cells and MMVECs, and inhibited
the tube formation of MMVECs. Co-treatment with metformin
eliminated these tumor-promoting phenotype induced by
IL-13. It should be noted that in our system metformin didn’t
affect the migration of LLC cells or MMVEC directly. These
results indicated that M2-like phenotype of macrophage
induced by IL-13 was blocked by metformin.
The effect of AMPKα in macrophage polarization
has been reported in two studies. In the study of Sag et al,
they found that stimulation of macrophages with IL-10
resulted in the rapid phosphorylation of AMPKα, whereas
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

stimulation of macrophages with LPS resulted in AMPKα dephosphorylation [37]. Further, they showed that expression
of dominant negative AMPKα enhanced LPS-induced TNFα
and IL-6. In contrast, transfection with a constitutively active
form of AMPKα reduced LPS-induced TNFα and IL-6.
However, they didn’t further analyze the role AMPKα in
IL-10 induced polarization of macrophages. Although IL10 is considered to be an inducer for alternative polarization
of macrophages, the signaling pathways and inflammatory
response to IL-10 stimulation are greatly different from that
for IL-4 and IL-13 stimulation [38–40]. In our study, we
36449

didn’t found the activation of AMPKα in either RAW264.7 or
BMDMs. The silence of AMPKα didn’t affect IL-13 induced
CD206 expression. This data suggested that AMPKα might
not be required for IL-13 induced polarization.
In the study of Mounier et al, they found that
BMDM from AMPKα-/- mouse showed reduced
expression of CD206 and CD163 in stimulation of IL-4
or IL-10, whereas the expression of Arg1 was not affected
[41]. They also didn’t find significant difference of marker
mRNA expression between wild type and AMPKα-/macrophages. In our study, we found both metformin and
AICAR significantly inhibited IL-13 induced expression
of CD206. Further, the silence of AMPKα didn’t cause
significant change in IL-13 induced CD206 expression,
while greatly abolished the effect of metformin inhibited
CD206 expression. Our result suggests that AMPKα is at
least partially responsible for the metformin.
The anticancer effects of metformin are associated
with both direct (insulin-independent) and indirect (insulindependent) actions of the drug. The indirect, insulindependent effects of metformin are mediated by the ability
of AMPK to reduce blood insulin, which plays a major
role in its anticancer activity since insulin has mitogenic
and pro-survival effects. The direct, insulin-independent
effects of metformin originate from LKB1-mediated
activation of AMPK and a reduction in mTOR signaling
and protein synthesis in cancer cells. Some recent reports
raise the possibility that metformin may mediate additional
anticancer effects independently of AMPK, LKB1, and
TSC2. Unlike these previous studies, our data suggested
that metformin may target angiogenesis in an indirect way
by inhibiting M2 polarization of macrophage.
In summary, we report the first evidence that metformin
inhibits M2-like polarization of macrophages both in vitro
and in vivo, which contributes to metastasis prevention role
of metformin. Our finding suggests that in addition to lower
circulating insulin and direct inhibitory effects on cancer
cells, the TAMs by is a potential new in the understanding
the benefit in cancer therapy. Our findings link TAM to the
anti-metastatic effect of metformin, providing further support
for clinical application of metformin.

DAPI for 5 min. For morphometric evaluation, at least five
optical fields per tumor section were randomly chosen,
analyzed by Olympus IX81-FV1000 confocal laserscanning microscope. For all the studies, 5–10 optical
fields (20× or 40× magnification) per tumor section were
randomly chosen and analyzed. Vessel area and mural
cell coverage was quantified by morphometric analysis as
described.

Flow cytometry
RAW264.7 and BMDMs were collected with scraper
and blocked with 3% BSA for 45 mins, and then were
incubated with PE-conjugated anti-mouse CD86 (1:100),
PE-conjugated anti-mouse CD206 (1:100) antibody or
FITC-conjugated anti-mouse F4/80 (1:200), according to
the manufacturers’ instructions. For each sample at least
1 × 104 cells should be analyzed using the BD FACSCalibur cytometer (Becton Dickin-son, San Jose, CA).

Cell transfection
The siRNA sequence was duplexes produced by
Genepharma, Co. (Shanghai, China). The sequences of
siRNAs used were as follows, Si-AMPK1: sense: UGA
CCGGACAUAAAGUGGCUGUGAATT, antisense: UUCAC
AGCCACUUUAUGUCCGGUCA-TT; Si-AMPK3: sense:
UCUCUUUCCUGAGGACCCAUCUUAUTT, antisense:
AU-AAGAUGGGUCCUCAGGAAAGAGATT. The trans
fection was performed using siRNA and jetPrime according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations.

Bone marrow derived macrophages isolation and
differentiation
Bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs)
were produced as previously described [27] with small
modification. Simply, Six week old C57BL/6 mice were
sacrificed and soaked in 75% ethanol. Bone marrow cells
were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 50 ng/ml
M-CSF for three days to obtain BMDMs.

Quantitative PCR assay
Total RNA from BMDM was isolated using the
Easy Pure RNA Kit (Transgen Biotech Co., Ltd), and
cDNA was synthesized. The sequences of the primers
used for the quantitative real time-PCR were listed in
Table 1.
The quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis was
performed by BioRad SYBR Premix. The reaction mixtures
containing SYBR Green were composed following the
manufacturer’s protocol. Relative expression levels of the
target genes were normalized with the control gene Actin.

Mouse pulmonary micro-vascular endothelial
cells isolation
Six week-old C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed and
lungs were removed and washed with PBS, then minced
into small pieces and incubated with 0.1% collagenase
I in 37°C for 30 min. The tissue suspension was passed
through a 70 μm cell strainer and centrifuged at 1000 rpm
for 5 minutes. Cells were resuspended in endothelial
cell growth media (Lonza, Walkersville, ML, USA)
and cultured in T75 flask. After 48 h, mouse pulmonary
micro-vascular endothelial cells (MMVECs) were
selected with anti-CD31-conjugated magnetic beads
as previously described and the purity of MMVEC
was confirmed by flow cytometry (Supplementary
Figure S3).

Conditioned medium preparation
Macrophage polarization was obtained by culturing
cells in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and
10 ng/mL IL-13 or 1 mM metformin for three days. Then
different polarized RAW264.7 cells were incubated in serum
free medium for 24 h, after which culture supernatants were
collected as conditioned medium (CM). CM was centrifuged
at 3000 rpm to separate out the debris and stored at −80°C.

Wound healing assay

for at least 30 min, and then all of the non-migrant cells
were removed from the upper chamber with cotton buds
dipped in PBS and discarded. The migrated cells on the
bottom part of the filter stained with 0.1% crystal violet.
The stained cells were subsequently photographed by a
LEICA DMI 4000B microscope. For the analysis, five
optical fields (10 × magnification) per well were randomly
chosen and quantitative analyzed by Image J software.

Mouse endothelial cells were seeded in 24-well plates
and cultured until 70–80% confluent. A straight scratch was
made by using a pipette tip, formatting an artificial wound.
Cells were incubated with conditioned medium for 12 h. To
assess the migration of cells across this artificial wound, five
optical fields (10 × magnification) were randomly chosen,
analyzed by using a LEICA DMI 4000B microscope with
Leica Application Suite software.

Western blot analysis

Tube formation assay

After treatment with compounds for the indicated
times, the macrophages were harvested. Then, cellular and
nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed as previously
described [28].

The MMVECs (2 × 104 cells per well) were
seeded in 96-well plates which have been filled with
50 μl matrigel and solidified in 37°C. Cells were cultured
in CM supplied with 2.5% FBS for 6 hours. To observe
the formation of tube-like structures, five optical fields
(10× magnification) per well were randomly chosen and
analyzed by a LEICA DMI 4000B microscope with Leica
Application Suite software.

Statistical analyses
Values are presented as mean ± SD. Two-tailed and
unpaired Student’s t test was used for statistical analysis,
and differences were considered significant for p values
less than 0.05.

Trans-well assay

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND FUNDING

A Trans-well Boyden Chamber (Costar, Bethesda,
MD, USA) was used for migration assay. LLC cells
or MMVECs were seeded in a density of 1 × 104 (in
200 μl CM) per well in the upper chamber. The lower
compartment contained 0.6 mL CM. After 24-hour
incubation at 37°C, the cells were fixed with 90% EtOH
