Transforming Growth Factor-b as a Therapeutic Target in
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Gianluigi Giannelli1, Erica Villa2, and Michael Lahn3

Abstract
Hepatocellular carcinoma arises in patients as a consequence of long-standing preexisting liver illnesses,
including viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse, or metabolic disease. In such preexisting liver diseases, TGF-b plays
an important role in orchestrating a favorable microenvironment for tumor cell growth and promoting
epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). TGF-b signaling promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression
by two mechanisms: ﬁrst, via an intrinsic activity as an autocrine or paracrine growth factor and, second, via
an extrinsic activity by inducing microenvironment changes, including cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts,
T regulatory cells, and inﬂammatory mediators. Although there is an increasing understanding on how
TGF-b signaling is associated with tumor progression in hepatocellular carcinoma, it is not clear whether
TGF-b signaling is limited to a certain subgroup of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or is a key driver of
hepatocellular carcinoma during the entire tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Inhibitors of the TGFb signaling have been shown to block hepatocellular carcinoma growth and progression by modulating EMT
in different experimental models, leading to the clinical investigation of the TGF-b inhibitor LY2157299
monohydrate in hepatocellular carcinoma. Preliminary results from a phase II clinical trial have shown
improved clinical outcome and also changes consistent with a reduction of EMT. Cancer Res; 74(7); 1890–4.

Introduction
Since its discovery in the early 1980s, TGF-b signaling has
been increasingly recognized as a key driver in cancer (1, 2).
Unlike its tumor suppressor function in normal tissue, TGF-b
activation causes tumor promotion in cancer tissue. The
switch from tumor suppression to promotion is not well
understood, but intrinsic and extrinsic factors seem to play
important roles. The loss of cell polarity, acquisition of motile
properties, and a mesenchymal phenotype during epithelial–
mesenchymal transition (EMT) are considered crucial intrinsic
changes of the tumor cells (3). These tumor promotion changes
mediated by TGF-b signaling are also accompanied by extrinsic factors originating from the tumor microenvironment, such
as angiogenesis, inﬂammation, and ﬁbroblast activation. In
addition to changes in the tumor tissue, alterations in the TGFb signaling pathway can also contribute to tumor growth. The
TGF-b signaling occurs via a canonical and a noncanonical
pathway. The canonical TGF-b signaling pathway is activated

when one of the three ligands (TGF-b1, TGF-b2, TGF-b3) binds
to the TGF-b receptor II (TGF-bRII), heterodimerizes with the
TGF-b-receptor I (TGF-bRI or ALK5), and transphosphorylates
the kinase domain of both receptors. This phosphorylation
step leads to a recruitment and phosphorylation of SMAD2
and SMAD3. After this phosphorylation, a SMAD signaling
cascade is initiated and it results in nuclear translocation and
gene transcription for a wide range of tumor-promoting mediators (4). In some tumors (including hepatocellular carcinoma), SMAD4 is mutated, which alters the TGF-b signaling
pathway, rendering the pathway inactive. The less-known
noncanonical activation pathway is associated with several
intracellular phosphorylation of proteins, such as jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 MAPK, ERK, or MEKK. For example,
the TGF-b inhibitor LY2109761, a surrogate compound of
LY2157299, has shown inhibitory activity by blocking dephosphorylating FAK, b1-integrin, MEK, ERK, AKT, mTOR, and
PTEN but not p-38-MAPK-kinase (5). This suggests that TGF-b
signaling has several mechanisms to activate either the tumor
cell or cells of the microenvironment.

A growing number of studies suggest the hepatocellular
carcinoma onset and progression is not just dependent on the
tumor cells or injured hepatocyte, but on other factors as well.
Using a more holistic view, it is becoming increasingly clear
that the cross-talk between tumor cells and host stroma
plays a key role in tumor growth. In such a context, TGF-b

Figure 1. Development from chronic inﬂammation to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; red circle, artery; green circle, bile duct; blue circle, vein). Hepatocellular

orchestrates the homeostasis of microenvironment components and tumor cells by balancing the activity of inﬂammatory cells or ﬁbroblast with tumor cell growth or progression.
For example, in treatment-resistant viral hepatitis, TGF-b
and IL-10 secretions are increased and associated with
increased T regulatory cells; these have a local immunosuppressive effect and consequently contribute to a persistent
viral infection. With continued inﬂammation of the liver,
reversible and irreversible remodeling are often observed,
including ﬁbrosis and early cirrhosis (6). This remodeling is
characterized by accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM)
proteins. The rich ECM deposition is driven in large part by
activation of TGF-b; if not stopped, this leads to cirrhosis
and eventually to liver failure. The accumulation of ECM
proteins leading to ﬁbrosis is still a reversible step. This phase
would be particularly important for therapeutic interventions
aimed at blocking the progression of liver disease, thus

preventing hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence. Unfortunately, such therapies are not yet available. As cirrhotic
process progresses inside the liver, dysplastic nodules with
initial chromosomal changes are often observed. These dysplastic nodules can progress to the early stages of hepatocellular carcinoma. In the liver tissue, cancer cells grow
embedded in an environment enriched with ECM and mediated by TGF-b and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF;
refs. 7, 8). This tight interaction between the tumor and the
surrounding cirrhotic liver is perhaps the most remarkable
hallmark of hepatocellular carcinoma (Fig. 1).

signaling responses, one called an "early" and another
termed "late" TGF-b signaling response. Intriguingly, the early
response pattern is associated with longer and the late
response pattern with shorter survival. It is possible that the
"early response" pattern reﬂects the physiologic inﬂammatory
response, while the "late response" pattern is associated with a
long-term TGF-b activation similar to the one described in
colorectal cancer (10). The role of TGF-b is also recognized in a
molecular classiﬁcation of hepatocellular carcinoma, where
the Wnt signaling pathway is regulated by TGF-b. In one
subgroup of hepatocellular carcinoma tumors, TGF-b signaling
appears to control tumor cell growth; in a second subgroup, it
is associated with larger tumors, low a-fetoprotein (AFP)
expression and poor prognosis (11). The identiﬁcation of such
a subgroup may represent a ﬁrst attempt to identify patients
with hepatocellular carcinoma likely to respond to TGF-b
signaling inhibition. Because of the differences between transcriptome-based studies, a review of such data is being conducted to obtain a common classiﬁcation and to better understand the pathophysiologic pathways driving hepatocellular
carcinoma. Upon review of these transcriptome-based reports,
TGF-b signaling may be associated with expression of AFP and
EpCAM (12). On the basis of this concomitant expression, TGFb signaling may be present in 25% of all early hepatocellular
carcinoma. It is important to remember that transcriptomebased evaluations are derived from surgical specimen after
local resections and are not from advanced hepatocellular
carcinoma. This has implications when interpreting the effect
of TGF-b signaling in later stages of hepatocellular carcinoma
or blocking this pathway with pharmacologic agents in more
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma stages.
The extrinsic effect of TGF-b signaling is a result of tumor
cell growth embedded in an ECM-enriched environment. This
condition is characterized by secretion of TGF-b and other
associated factors, such as CTGF, which affects cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts (7, 8). In addition to activation of ﬁbroblasts,
TGF-b signaling has been associated with T regulatory cells, for
example by activation of chemokines (such as CCL22) or by
immune presentation of AFP (13, 14). More recently, TGF-b
signaling has also been associated with tumor-initiating cells
(15). Ongoing stimulation of liver progenitor cells by TGF-b
leads to their transformation into tumor-initiating cells as
shown by TGF-b–induced changes in CD90 and CD133 expression (15).
The intrinsic effects of TGF-b signaling are mostly
observed in highly invasive tumor conditions. TGF-b signaling is associated with loss of cell polarity, acquisition of
cellular motility, and increased tumor invasion (5, 16–22). A
main change in tumor cells is related to EMT as measured by
E-cadherin expression, a marker of EMT. In the presence of
TGF-b, E-cadherin is shed from tumor cells and renders
tumor cells more invasive and migratory. In association with
other components of the tissue microenvironment such as
laminin-5 (Ln-5) or CD44, TGF-b induces the transcription
factor Snail, another component of EMT; this induction is
also associated with poor prognosis (19, 23). Taken together,
it appears that TGF-b signaling causes EMT and renders
tumors more invasive.

Barriers for Developing TGF-b Inhibitors in
Hepatocellular Carcinoma
One of the main challenges for developing an effective
therapy against hepatocellular carcinoma is related to the
underlying cirrhosis, which is not only associated with a
reduced liver function, but also provides the support for tumor
cell growth. Because of this unique microenvironment, new
drugs should not only treat the tumor cells, but also prevent
new tumoral lesions. Hence, the ideal drug should have a low
toxicity proﬁle, antitumor activity, and chemopreventive activity. Such a drug may have activity in later lines of treatment, but
also in the adjuvant setting together with other ablative
therapies.
For example, multikinase inhibitors have toxicity proﬁles
that limit their use to later lines of treatment. Sunitinib was
discontinued because of serious adverse events; other antiangiogenic kinase inhibitors carried a high risk of bleeding in
patients with compromised coagulation. With the exception of
sorafenib that has been used in conjunction with transarterial
chemoembolization (24), few kinase inhibitors have been
evaluated in adjuvant treatment regimens primarily because
of their toxicity proﬁle.
The antitumor activity of the ideal drug candidate would
also have to show a relatively immediate antitumor effect.
Sorafenib blocks multiple signaling pathways and has not only
in an antiangiogenic effect, but also induces tumor cell apoptosis (25). However, several attempts to develop similarly
active agents have thus far failed.
Finally, the ideal drug candidate would need to block
processes associated with liver cirrhosis. By targeting this
microenvironment signal, it is possible to inhibit the stimulus
for tumor cell growth and thus prevent new tumor lesion. This
aspect of drug development may have been overlooked during
recent years; only recently have agents demonstrated this
activity.
Unlike previously investigated agents, the inhibition of TGFb signaling affects hepatocellular carcinoma in different stages
of development and progression and may offer a wider therapeutic application. This is due to the presence of TGF-b
signaling throughout the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, a modulator of microenvironment may not
have an immediate antitumor effect as observed for chemotherapeutic treatments. Rather, the impact on the molecular
and cellular tumor biology may require longer treatment times
to "restore" the host tissue to a more physiologic phenotype.

Blocking TGF-b in Hepatocellular Carcinoma
Using a Speciﬁc TGF-b Inhibitor
Given the hypothesized activity of TGF-b signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma, small-molecule inhibitors targeting the
TGF-bRI serine/threonine kinase have been developed, including LY2157299 monohydrate (LY2157299; ref. 16). LY2157299 is
now in clinical evaluation and has shown antitumor effects in
patients with glioblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (26).
Studying the antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo remains a
challenge for LY2157299. Hence, LY2157299 and the surrogate
compound LY2109761 have been used in some select in vitro

TGF-b Signaling in Hepatocellular Carcinoma

and in vivo models to better understand its activity in hepatocellular carcinoma. Using in vitro assays ﬁrst, we characterized the role of TGF-b signaling in the migration and invasion
of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. These studies suggested that
LY2157299 did not have an apoptotic effect at the intended
pharmacologic levels for patients, but rather blocked invasion
and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells (17). At the
same time, the levels of E-cadherin were altered increasing the
E-cadherin tissue expression and reducing the secretion of Ecadherin in the supernatant. LY2157299 seems to also block the
CTGF production with the consequent reduction of stromal
reaction. This reduces tumor growth in experimental models
and will likely have a beneﬁcial impact on the cirrhotic process
(17, 20). LY2157299 also reduces hepatocellular carcinoma
growth and progression by inhibiting neoangiogenesis. Indirectly, LY2157299 blocks VEGF production with better biologic
activity than the antiangiogenic drug bevacizumab. Moreover,
LY2157299 blocks b1-integrin activation in cancer cells and
consequently blocks intravasation of hepatocellular carcinoma
cells into the blood vessels (18, 21).
Overall, the encouraging antitumor activities observed with
LY2157299 formed the rationale for investigating LY2157299 in
a phase II clinical trial of patients who either failed previous
sorafenib treatment or were ineligible to receive sorafenib
(NCT01246986, http://clinicaltrials.gov). On the basis of the
previous observations that high AFP levels correlate with high
TGF-b1 levels (27), a study in patients with elevated AFP was
initiated to investigate the activity of a TGF-b inhibitor in
patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, where EMT is a key
driver. In these patients, LY2157299 reduced not only TGF-b1,
but also E-cadherin in plasma of patients (28). This reduction is
consistent with the in vitro studies, where LY2157299 also
reduced the secretion of E-cadherin while inhibiting the
TGF-b signaling (17). So far, no other drug treatment has been

associated with changes in plasma TGF-b1 and E-cadherin
levels. This is remarkable because biomarker responses are
rarely observed in hepatocellular carcinoma treatments. In
approximately 23% of patients treated with LY2157299, serum
AFP levels were reduced by more than 20% compared with
baseline. These patients had a beneﬁt assessed by time-totumor progression (18.6 weeks) and also by overall survival
(93.1 weeks) compared with patients who had no AFP
responses (29). Although AFP is a tumor marker of hepatocellular carcinoma, the responses in patients with elevated AFP
may perhaps mean more than just an overall tumor response.
Currently, the relationship of AFP to E-cadherin is being
investigated to better understand the signiﬁcance of AFP
responses.
The use of LY2157299 to block TGF-b signaling appears to
modulate EMT and has a clinically meaningful beneﬁt to
patients. The measurement of E-cadherin and TGF-b1 levels
may also open new opportunities in novel drug development
approaches; ongoing clinical studies will determine whether
LY2157299 will provide a new treatment option for patients.
Meanwhile, it is gratifying that some of the in vitro observations
have resulted in clinical observations.
