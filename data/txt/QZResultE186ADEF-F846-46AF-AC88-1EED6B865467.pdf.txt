Abstract
Cell line models of glucocorticoid resistance in childhood
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) almost invariably exhibit
altered glucocorticoid receptor (GR) function. However, these
findings are incongruous with those using specimens derived
directly from leukemia patients, in which GR alterations are
rarely found. Consequently, mechanisms of glucocorticoid
resistance in the clinical setting remain largely unresolved.
We present a novel paradigm of glucocorticoid resistance in
childhood ALL, in which patient biopsies have been directly
established as continuous xenografts in immune-deficient
mice, without prior in vitro culture. We show that the GRs
from six highly dexamethasone-resistant xenografts (in vitro
IC50 >10 Mmol/L) exhibit no defects in ligand-induced nuclear
translocation and binding to a consensus glucocorticoid
response element (GRE). This finding contrasts with five
commonly used leukemia cell lines, all of which exhibited
defective GRE binding. Moreover, whereas the GRs of
dexamethasone-resistant xenografts were transcriptionally
active, as assessed by the ability to induce the glucocorticoidinduced leucine zipper (GILZ) gene, resistance was associated
with failure to induce the bim gene, which encodes a
proapoptotic BH3-only protein. Furthermore, the receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitor, SU11657, completely reversed
dexamethasone resistance in a xenograft expressing functional GR, indicating that pharmacologic reversal of glucocorticoid resistance in childhood ALL is achievable. [Cancer

Introduction
Glucocorticoids are among the most effective agents used in the
treatment of lymphoid malignancies, including childhood acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; ref. 1) due to their ability to induce
apoptosis of lymphoid cells (2). The glucocorticoid-induced
apoptotic response is mediated through the glucocorticoid
receptor (GR), a member of the nuclear receptor family of
ligand-dependent transcription factors, which is localized in the
cytoplasm of unstimulated cells (3).

Ligand binding to the GR results in its dissociation from
chaperone proteins that tether the receptor in the cytoplasm,
causing a conformational change in the protein that unmasks
domains for nuclear translocation, receptor dimerization, DNA
binding, and transactivation (2). The activated receptor-ligand
complex translocates to the nucleus where it binds as a homodimer
to specific glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) found in the
promoter and enhancer regions of glucocorticoid-responsive genes.
Changes in gene expression ultimately result in proteolytic
activation of caspases that cleave critical cellular substrates
and are responsible for the hallmark changes associated with
apoptosis (4).
A number of recent studies have attempted to identify critical
glucocorticoid-regulated genes, with the emerging view that an
interactive network of genes undergoes altered expression before
the onset of apoptosis (5–7). Interestingly, the only proapoptotic
protein identified to date to be up-regulated by glucocorticoids in
several models of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis is the BH3-only
Bcl-2 family member, Bim (6, 8–12). A critical role for Bim in
glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of human precursor B (pre-B)
ALL cells was recently identified (10). BH3-only Bcl-2 family
members (including Bim, Bad, Bid, Bik, Bmf, Puma, Noxa, and Hrk)
are related to other Bcl-2 proteins through only a single region of
homology, the BH3 domain, and are potent inducers of apoptosis
through the activation of Bax (13). The formation of pores in the
outer mitochondrial membrane by Bax/Bak oligomers leads to loss
of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and the subsequent
release of proapoptotic factors such as cytochrome c and SMAC/
DIABLO into the cytoplasm that promote the activation of initiator
caspases (2).
Despite the central role of glucocorticoids in all protocols for the
treatment of ALL, mechanisms by which they act on their target
cells, and lesions underlying resistance, remain poorly understood
(2). This is due, in part, to lack of suitable experimental systems to
study the disease. Due to the limited proliferative capacity of
primary leukemia cells in vitro, studies investigating glucocorticoid
resistance have focused to a greater extent on laboratory-derived
ALL cell lines. Resistance in such cell lines is almost invariably
associated with defects in receptor-ligand interactions, such as
mutations in the ligand binding domain of the GR (14–16).
However, similar studies using primary patient samples have
detected only isolated cases of somatic mutations in the GR,
leading to poor glucocorticoid response (17, 18). Although existing
data are conflicting, the majority of studies have failed to associate
glucocorticoid resistance in patient samples with either relative
expression of the various isoforms of the receptor (19, 20),
polymorphisms within the coding region of the GR gene (18), or
expression levels of cochaperone proteins associated with the
GR (21).

Glucocorticoid Resistance Mechanisms in Childhood ALL

We have previously shown that the in vivo and in vitro
dexamethasone responses of a panel of childhood ALL biopsies
established as xenografts in nonobese diabetic/severe combined
immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice reflected the clinical outcome
of the patients from whom the xenografts were derived (9, 22).
In the current study, we report that all highly resistant xenografts
exhibited ligand-dependent GR DNA binding and transcriptional
induction of glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), a direct
transcriptional target of the GR. However, there was a clear
disparity between sensitive and resistant xenografts in their ability
to induce transcription of bim, a gene that lacks GREs in its
promoter and seems not to be a direct transcriptional target of the
GR. These results are in direct contrast with glucocorticoidresistant cell lines, which exhibited defects upstream of nuclear
translocation of the GR and/or DNA binding. Our finding of
transcriptionally functional GR in all childhood ALL xenografts
derived directly from biopsy specimens indicates that reversal of
glucocorticoid resistance in the clinic is achievable. Hence, we also
report the complete reversal of high-level glucocorticoid resistance
and restitution of Bim induction in childhood ALL xenograft cells
cotreated with the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor,
SU11657.

Materials and Methods
NOD/SCID mouse model of childhood ALL. Procedures by which we
previously established continuous xenografts from childhood ALL biopsies
in NOD/SCID mice and assessed their in vivo sensitivity to dexamethasone
are described in detail elsewhere (22, 23). Xenograft characteristics are
presented in Table 1. Leukemia progression in dexamethasone- or vehicle
control-treated mice was monitored by quantifying human CD45 (pan
leukocyte)-positive (huCD45+) cells versus total murine CD45+ and huCD45+

cells (% huCD45+) in the peripheral blood (PB). ALL-10, ALL-4CL, and ALL7CL (see below) were monitored using anti-human CD19 antibodies due to
low expression of cell surface CD45. Mouse event-free survival (EFS) was
calculated by the number of days from treatment initiation until the
proportion of human cells in the PB reached 25%. For comparisons between
xenografts, the median EFS for control mice was subtracted from the
median EFS for drug-treated mice to generate a tumor growth delay (TGD).
All experimental studies had approval from the Human Research Ethics
Committee and the Animal Care and Ethics Committee of the University of
New South Wales.
Development and characterization of xenograft-derived strains. Cell
lines were established in vitro from ALL-4 (ALL-4CL) and ALL-7 (ALL7CL) xenograft cells according to our previously published method (24).
Once established as continuously growing lines, the cells were adapted to
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mmol/L
pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, 10 Amol/L 2-mercaptoethanol, and
2 mmol/L L-glutamine. Because these cultured cells require high cell
density and exhibit prolonged population doubling times, they will
collectively be referred to as xenograft-derived strains (XDS) to
distinguish them from the established leukemia cell lines also used in
this study (see below).
Expression of a range of lineage-specific and differentiation markers on
the surface of XDS and on cells harvested from the spleens of engrafted
mice was analyzed using standard procedures (22, 23). Cytogenetic analysis
was done at SydneyGenetics, Sydney IVF (Sydney, NSW, Australia) using
standard procedures (25). Chromosomal spreads were prepared from
cultures following colcemid-induced metaphase arrest (0.2 Ag/mL for
30 min at 37jC). Cells were resuspended in 0.075 mol/L KCl hypotonic
solution for 20 min at room temperature, then fixed with methanol/acetic
acid (3:1), dropped onto microscope slides, and GTG banded according to
standard techniques (25). Finally, cells were examined at a chromosome
resolution ranging from 200 to 400 bands per haploid set. Chromosomal
abnormalities were identified and described according to International
System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN; 1995).

In vitro cell culture. Jurkat and REH cell lines were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection, and UOC-B1 and Hal-01 cell lines were
kindly provided by Dr. A. Thomas Look (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute,
Boston, MA). CEM WT, CEM MTX-R3, and Nalm-6 cells used in the
study were laboratory stock cell lines (9). These cell lines were maintained
in suspension culture in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and
2 mmol/L L-glutamine.
For all experiments described in this study, xenograft cells were
retrieved from cryostorage and resuspended in QBSF-60 medium (Quality
Biological) supplemented with Flt-3 ligand (20 ng/mL; kindly provided by
Amgen), penicillin (100 units/mL), streptomycin (100 Ag/mL), and
L-glutamine (2 mmol/L; QBSF-60/F). Viability was determined by exclusion
of 0.2% trypan blue. For drug treatments, cells were equilibrated in QBSF60/F in a humidified atmosphere overnight at 37jC, 5% CO2 before
addition of dexamethasone or SU11657 (kindly provided by Pfizer Inc.,
Groton, CT). An equivalent volume of media only was added to control
cells. Cells were harvested at the appropriate time points by centrifugation
at 490  g for 10 min, aspirating media, and washing cells twice with
sterile PBS.
In vitro dexamethasone sensitivity was assessed using the colorimetric 3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay,
exactly as described previously (9). Cell viability was calculated as a
percentage of untreated controls. Results presented are the mean F SE of at
least three independent experiments. IC50 (inhibitory concentration, 50%)
values were calculated from cumulative survival curves.
Analysis of protein expression. The preparation of whole-cell extracts,
separation of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions using the NE-PER Nuclear
and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents Kit (Pierce), determination of protein
concentration, and analysis of cellular proteins by immunoblotting have
been described in detail elsewhere (9). Polyclonal antibodies specific for the
following proteins were used: GR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), actin and Bim
(Sigma), and DNA topoisomerase I (topo I) and Bax (BD Biosciences
PharMingen). Secondary antibodies used were horseradish peroxidase
(HRP) conjugates of either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G
(Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, England).

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (9). May 1, 2007

GR-DNA Binding ELISA. GR-DNA binding affinity in nuclear extracts
was quantified by TransAM Transcription Factor ELISA (Active Motif).
Nuclear extracts were prepared as above, and 10-Ag aliquots of protein were
assayed for GR DNA-binding activity according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. GR-DNA binding activity was expressed relative to an
equivalent amount of positive control nuclear extract prepared from HeLa
cells treated with dexamethasone (100 nmol/L, 1 h).
Real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Real-time quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was carried out using standard techniques.
Briefly, total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and firststrand cDNA was synthesized in a 20-AL reaction volume using 2 Ag of total
RNA, 500 ng of random primers (Roche), and 200 units of M-MLV Reverse
Transcriptase (Invitrogen). The reaction mixture was ultimately diluted to
50 AL with nuclease-free water.
Primers and probes for an early response gene (GILZ) possessing GREs in
its promoter region and a late response gene (bim) that does not were
purchased from Assays-on-Demand (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative realtime RT-PCR analysis was carried out in triplicate under the following
cycling conditions: 50jC for 2 min and 95jC for 10 min, followed by 40
cycles of 95jC for 15 s and 60jC for 1 min, as per the manufacturer’s
instructions. Reactions without template and/or enzyme were used as
negative controls. Elongation factor-1a (EF-1a) was used as an internal
standard in each reaction, with primer and probe concentrations optimized
to not interfere with target gene amplification (primers EF-1aF, 5¶CTGAACCATCCAGGCCAAAT-3¶; EF-1aR, 5¶-GCCGTGTGGCAATCCAAT-3¶;
Probe, 5¶-VIC-AGCGCCGGCTATGCCCCTG-TAMRA-3¶). RNA quantity was
normalized to the corresponding EF-1a control by the DC t method. Fold
differences were calculated by comparison with the vehicle-treated control
at each time point.

continuous xenografts, XDS, and ALL cell lines, the details of which
are shown in Table 1. We have previously described the
development of a panel of continuous ALL xenografts in NOD/
SCID mice, showed their relevance to the clinical disease, and
documented their in vivo and in vitro sensitivity to dexamethasone
(9, 22, 23). Figure 1A illustrates the range of in vivo responses of
representative xenografts to dexamethasone, showing the proportion of huCD45+ cells in PB over time of mice engrafted with ALL-3
or ALL-19, then treated with either dexamethasone or saline
control. The progression of ALL-19 was not affected by treatment
with dexamethasone, showing no obvious difference from saline
control-treated mice. In contrast, the progression of ALL-3 was
delayed by dexamethasone treatment for f60 days.
Kaplan-Meier plots showing EFS of mice engrafted with six
continuous xenografts and treated with saline or dexamethasone
(Fig. 1B and C) show the range of responses to treatment. ALL-18
was excluded due to its slow rate of engraftment (23). In vivo
TGD values and in vitro dexamethasone sensitivity, determined by
MTT assay, are indicated in Table 1, with significant concordance
between the two assays (relative cell survival by MTT assay at
10 nmol/L dexamethasone versus in vivo TGD, r = 0.77; P = 0.0098).
A notable exception was ALL-8, which was previously shown to
have down-regulated GR expression (9) and was sensitive in vitro
but resistant in vivo. We have previously shown that the
stratification of xenografts according to patient outcome reveals
a significant difference in TGD values (22). Furthermore, of the
three most sensitive xenografts (TGD, 52.8–66.3 days, ALL-3, ALL11, and ALL-16), only one patient experienced a relapse, and all
remained alive >10 years from diagnosis. In contrast, the three
most resistant (TGD, 2.3–17.2 days, ALL-4, ALL-8, and ALL-19) all
relapsed and died within 18 months of diagnosis; and of the four
exhibiting intermediate sensitivity (TGD, 30.3–37.3 days, ALL-2,
ALL-7, ALL-10, and ALL-17), three relapsed, and two died of disease
(22). The results indicate that this panel of xenografts is a clinically
relevant model. Similar in vivo dexamethasone sensitivity data for
all xenografts except ALL-4 and ALL-10, and the in vitro data for all
continuous xenografts, was previously published (9, 22).
Xenograft cells are principally suitable only for short-term
in vitro culture (22), although we have successfully established XDS
from two xenografts, ALL-4CL and ALL-7CL, by passaging at high
density until a cell line was established. The conditions required to
develop these XDS were identical to those necessary to establish
cell lines from primary patient specimens (24). Comparison of the
karyotypes of these XDS with their respective parental xenografts
provides evidence that a clonal subpopulation (dominant in
the case of ALL-4, but minor for ALL-7) emerged in vitro from
the xenograft mixed populations (Table 2). Moreover, whereas the
immunophenotype of ALL-4CL was identical to ALL-4, the

emergence of ALL-7CL resulted in the loss of cell surface CD45
and CD11b expression (Table 2). Despite these changes, ALL4CL and ALL-7CL exhibited responses to dexamethasone both
in vivo and in vitro that were comparable to their respective
parental xenografts (Table 1). In addition, the XDS showed similar
patterns of organ infiltration to the parental xenografts when
inoculated into NOD/SCID mice (data not shown). The population
doubling times for ALL-4CL and ALL-7CL were 33 and 55 h,
respectively.
Cell lines have routinely been used to define mechanisms of
glucocorticoid resistance in ALL (14, 26). Several human ALL cell
lines were also investigated in this study, which exhibited
sensitivity (CEM WT, Nalm-6) or resistance (CEM MTX-R3, Jurkat,
HAL-01, UOC-B1, REH) to dexamethasone (Table 1). Representative
MTT cytotoxicity assays for CEM WT, Nalm-6, Jurkat, and REH cells
are shown in Fig. 1D.
GR expression and function. Glucocorticoid resistance mechanisms identified in ALL cell lines almost invariably involve defects
in the GR. Consequently, GR expression and function were
rigorously tested in our experimental model of dexamethasone
resistance. Previous studies have shown that 10/11 continuous

xenografts tested exhibited no defects in GR expression, with only
the T-cell ALL (T-ALL), ALL-8, expressing significantly lower levels
of receptor (9). In addition, unlike cell lines, none of the xenografts
tested showed induction of the GR after exposure to dexamethasone, regardless of glucocorticoid sensitivity. In contrast, Fig. 2A
and B shows that the pre-B ALL cell line REH expresses no
detectable GR, whereas dexamethasone-resistant CEM MTX-R3,
Jurkat, and HAL-01 all express levels of GR <50% than those of
dexamethasone-sensitive CEM WT cells. Dexamethasone-resistant
UOC-B1 cells, as well as the ALL-4CL and ALL-7CL XDS, expressed
levels of GR comparable to or greater than CEM WT cells. The CEM
WT cell line also showed autoinduction of the GR following
exposure to dexamethasone, consistent with previous reports (27),

although no other cell line showed a similar change in GR
expression.
We have previously shown nuclear translocation of the GR
following exposure of 11 continuous xenografts to dexamethasone
for 5 h (9), and Fig. 3A and B extend these findings to confirm no
notable differences in the kinetics of ligand-induced GR nuclear
translocation between two sensitive (ALL-3 and ALL-16) and two
resistant (ALL-7 and ALL-19) xenografts. In contrast, Fig. 3C shows
that 4/5 highly dexamethasone-resistant ALL cell lines (CEM MTXR3, Jurkat, REH, and Hal-01) exhibited defective GR nuclear
translocation in the presence of ligand, with only UOC-B1 cells
showing GR translocation. The XDS ALL-4CL and ALL-7CL also
exhibited ligand-induced GR nuclear translocation (Fig. 3C). These

resistance, the ability of the GR in nuclear extracts of dexamethasone-treated cells to bind a GRE was assessed using a DNAbinding ELISA assay (Fig. 4). Although all xenografts and XDS,
regardless of whether they were resistant to dexamethasone,
exhibited ligand-induced DNA binding to varying degrees, all of
the resistant cell lines (including UOC-B1, which exhibited GR
nuclear translocation) were defective in DNA binding activity.
The decreased DNA binding exhibited by ALL-8 is consistent with
the reduced GR expression we have previously documented in this

xenograft (9). These data confirm fundamental differences in
mechanisms of glucocorticoid resistance in long-term in vitro
cultured ALL cell lines compared with continuous xenografts
established in vivo, as well as XDS.
Several recent large-scale gene expression studies have identified
glucocorticoid-induced genes in ALL model systems (5, 6, 28–30).
We have previously shown defective induction of one of these
genes, Bim, at the protein level, in dexamethasone-resistant
xenografts (9). The bim gene promoter does not contain a
consensus GRE (6, 31), and therefore, we compared the induction
of bim and a gene that does contain a GRE, GILZ, using
quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Figure 5A clearly shows that
xenograft cells, regardless of whether they were resistant to
dexamethasone, induced GILZ in response to ligand treatment.
GILZ expression reached a maximum within 1 to 2 h of
dexamethasone exposure. In agreement with our previous study
(9), the disparity between sensitive and resistant xenografts seemed
to emerge in induction of bim, with resistant xenografts (ALL-2 and
ALL-19) clearly defective (Fig. 5B). In contrast, all glucocorticoidresistant cell lines were defective in both GILZ (Fig. 5C) and bim
(Fig. 5D) induction in response to dexamethasone treatment, in
agreement with their deficiencies in GR nuclear translocation
(Fig. 3C) and DNA binding (Fig. 4). Both XDS (ALL-4CL and ALL7CL) exhibited induction of GILZ but not bim (Fig. 5C and D),
consistent with dexamethasone-resistant xenografts but not cell
lines. The real-time quantitative RT-PCR data shown in Table 3
confirm that the GILZ gene was induced in all xenografts in
response to dexamethasone treatment, regardless of their sensitivity to dexamethasone, but only in the sensitive CEM cell line and
not the five resistant cell lines. These data again highlight the
differences in glucocorticoid resistance mechanisms within this
ALL experimental model system.
Pharmacologic reversal of glucocorticoid resistance in ALL
xenograft cells. The above observations of dexamethasoneinduced GR DNA binding and induction of gene transcription in
resistant ALL xenograft models, along with observations that GR
defects are rare in primary patient biopsies (17–20, 32), suggest that
pharmacologic reversal of glucocorticoid resistance is achievable

proof of principle for the ability to pharmacologically modulate
glucocorticoid resistance with RTK inhibitors in a highly resistant
xenograft, resulting in restored Bim induction and apoptosis in
response to dexamethasone.
In all leukemia cell lines analyzed, glucocorticoid resistance
manifested itself at the level of the receptor, as evidenced by defects
in their ability to bind DNA and induce expression of the earlyinduced gene, GILZ. The GR mutations underlying the CEM WT
subline, CEM MTX-R3, and the Jurkat cell line have previously been
described (14, 33). However, before the current report, the lesions
underlying resistance in the REH, Hal-01, and UOC-B1 cell lines
were unclear. In this study, we show that glucocorticoid resistance
in the REH cell line can be attributed to a lack of detectable GR.
Although the Hal-01 cell line has detectable GR protein, our results
show an impaired response to glucocorticoid treatment evidenced
by a lack of ligand-induced nuclear translocation, presumably due
to a mutation in the receptor resulting in either impaired ligand
binding or defective nuclear localization signals. Only one of the

in the clinical setting. With this aim, we have been able to
completely reverse dexamethasone resistance in ALL-7 using the
RTK inhibitor SU11657 (Fig. 6A and B). At concentrations of up
to 10 Amol/L, SU11657 alone was not cytotoxic toward ALL-7 cells
(Fig. 6B). However, coincubation of 10 nmol/L SU11657 with 100
nmol/L dexamethasone caused an approximate 20% decrease in
ALL-7 cell viability compared with controls, with a concomitant
decrease in cell viability as the SU11657 concentration was
increased. Coincubation of 10 Amol/L SU11657 with 100 nmol/L
dexamethasone caused a >95% loss of cell viability. Moreover,
the dexamethasone IC50 value of ALL-7 cells coincubated with
1 Amol/L SU11657 was <10 nmol/L (Fig. 6A), consistent with the
three most sensitive xenografts, ALL-3, ALL-11, and ALL-16 (Table 1
and ref. 9). SU11657 was unable to reverse dexamethasone
resistance in any of the five cell lines expressing defective GR
(data not shown). Figure 6C and D shows that the combination of
SU11657 and dexamethasone also caused a greater than additive
induction of Bim protein isoforms in ALL-7 cells, consistent with
the reversal of dexamethasone resistance.

Discussion
Despite the central role of glucocorticoids in all protocols for the
treatment of childhood ALL, the mechanisms underlying resistance
remain poorly understood. The data described in this report
present a new paradigm for elucidating glucocorticoid resistance
mechanisms in pediatric ALL and for bridging the gap in
understanding between studies using laboratory cell lines and
those using primary biopsy specimens. In contrast with leukemia
cell line studies, our findings present clear evidence that
glucocorticoid resistance in xenografts established directly from
biopsy material is associated with functional GR signaling pathways and transcriptional induction of a primary target of the GR,
GILZ. However, glucocorticoid resistance manifested in the failure
of the resistant xenografts to induce mRNA expression of the
proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, bim. Furthermore, we provide

Glucocorticoid Resistance Mechanisms in Childhood ALL

resistant cell lines included in this study (UOC-B1) underwent
ligand-induced nuclear translocation, but failed to show DNA
binding activity and GILZ induction.
Although the reasons for the disparity between the incidence of
mutations in cell line models versus clinical samples remains
unclear, the results from xenografts more closely represent the
clinical situation, where GR mutations are infrequently encountered and cannot account for the prevalence of glucocorticoid
resistance (17, 18). In support of this, sequencing of the entire
coding region of the GR in one sensitive (ALL-3) and four resistant
xenografts (ALL-2, ALL-4, ALL-7, and ALL-19) failed to reveal any
mutations affecting the GR protein.5
In contrast to the findings in cell lines, all xenografts,
independent of sensitivity to dexamethasone, showed an ability
to activate GR signaling pathways and induce GILZ, a primary
target of the GR containing at least three functional GREs in its
promoter (34). Global changes in gene expression have been further
evaluated in two sensitive (ALL-3 and ALL-16) and two resistant
(ALL-7 and ALL-19) xenografts using chemiluminescence-based
gene arrays.6 Following treatment with dexamethasone, all four
xenografts induced primary GR targets, including GILZ and FKBP5
(34), as well as other genes identified as glucocorticoid-regulated
genes in cell line models, CD53/MOX44 and BTG1 (6, 7). In addition
to the cell line models, these genes have also been identified as
being regulated by glucocorticoid treatment in vivo by microarray
analysis of primary patient samples (30). Although the individual
contributions of these genes to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis
remain unclear, these findings indicate that the resistant xenografts
are able to activate glucocorticoid signaling pathways, and that the
factor(s) preventing the induction of bim are downstream of the
transactivating functions of the receptor.
Bim was first identified as a mediator of glucocorticoid-induced
apoptosis in microarray studies of murine and human leukemia
cell lines (6). These results were confirmed at the protein level in
leukemia cell lines and in our xenograft model of ALL (6, 9, 11, 12).
The functional role of Bim was subsequently shown by small
interfering RNA and short hairpin RNA inhibition of Bim
expression in a highly sensitive pre-B leukemia cell line conferring
resistance to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis (10). Studies of
knock-out mice of various BH3-only proteins provided evidence
that only knock-out of Bim and Puma confer any degree of resistance to glucocorticoid treatment in murine thymocytes (8, 35).
Although the role of Bim has been established in glucocorticoidinduced apoptosis of ALL cells, no studies to date have identified
a similar role for Puma (12), although increases in puma mRNA
have been reported in primary murine thymocytes exposed to
dexamethasone (36).
Glucocorticoid-induced Bim up-regulation does not seem to be
the direct result of transcriptional activity of the GR because the
human bim promoter does not contain any GREs, and apoptosis is
dependent on de novo protein synthesis (6, 12). However, the
details of the signaling pathways upstream of bim induction
remain unclear. Regulation of the various isoforms of Bim is
complex and involves both transcriptional and post-translational
mechanisms, dependent on cellular context (37). Increases in Bim
expression may be the result of (a) activation of the bim gene by
transcription factors, including Foxo3a/FKHRL1, RUNX3, and E2F1

(38–40); (b) release of the two largest isoforms of Bim, BimEL, and
BimL, from the cytoskeleton, where they are sequestered in healthy
cells (41); (c) relief of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2–
mediated phosphorylation of BimEL, which targets it for proteasomal degradation in healthy cells (42); and (d) demethylation of the
bim promoter in leukemia cell lines (43).
The SU series of compounds, originally developed as antiangiogenic agents, are multitargeted small-molecule RTK inhibitors
displaying differential selectivity for class III and V RTKs, including
platelet-derived growth factor receptors, vascular endothelial
growth factor receptors, Flt-3, and Kit (44). Preclinical and phase
I/II studies have established the efficacy of this family of RTK
inhibitors against a variety of malignancies that are resistant to
conventional chemotherapy (45, 46). In this study, we showed that
the RTK inhibitor SU11657 (as well as SU11248, SU5416, and
SU6668)7 acts synergistically with dexamethasone to modulate
signaling through Bim and induce apoptosis in a highly
glucocorticoid-resistant xenograft, ALL-7, conferring dexamethasone IC50 values comparable with the most sensitive xenografts.
These findings provide proof-of-principle evidence for the ability to
therapeutically modulate glucocorticoid resistance in patients.
It is currently unclear how inhibition of RTK activity is able to
reverse glucocorticoid resistance in ALL-7. Further studies are
under way to delineate the critical signaling pathways affected by
RTK inhibition in this xenograft and whether inhibition of a single
pathway or simultaneous inhibition of multiple pathways restores
glucocorticoid sensitivity. In this panel of xenografts, there seems
to be divergent mechanisms of resistance upstream of Bim because
the RTK inhibitors tested were unable to circumvent resistance in
other highly resistant xenografts. However, because all xenografts
contain GRs that seem to be functional, it is likely that
glucocorticoid sensitivity could be restored by the interruption of
the appropriate signaling pathway. Recently, the mTOR inhibitor
rapamycin has been identified as a modulator of glucocorticoid
resistance in leukemia cell lines by a mechanism involving the
down-regulation of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 (47). Similar
studies of multiple myeloma cell lines and primary cells also
identified additional compounds that sensitize resistant cells to
dexamethasone, including rapamycin and R-etodolac, that may
also be of benefit in leukemia cells (48, 49). In a clinical setting,
individual patients may have to be molecularly profiled to identify
those who may benefit from combination treatment with
glucocorticoids and RTK inhibitors.
In conclusion, our findings show that mechanisms underlying
glucocorticoid resistance in xenograft models of childhood ALL,
which have been shown to recapitulate the primary disease state,
are the result of defective signaling pathways that abrogate
induction of the proapoptotic protein Bim. This finding is in
contrast with those using glucocorticoid-resistant cell lines, which
exhibit a lack of GR binding to GREs, indicative of defects at the
level of the GR. Importantly, this study shows for the first time that
high-level glucocorticoid resistance can be completely reversed by
the coadministration of concentrations of RTK inhibitors that are
achievable in the plasma of patients (50) and indicates that
pharmacologic modulation of glucocorticoid resistance in the
clinical setting is feasible. This novel paradigm of glucocorticoid
resistance (Supplementary Fig. S1) in childhood ALL may assist in
