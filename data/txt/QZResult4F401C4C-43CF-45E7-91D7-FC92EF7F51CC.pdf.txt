ABSTRACT
An association has been reported between miR-34a-5p and several types of cancer.
Specifically, in this study, using systematic observations of multi-drug sensitive (G292 and MG63.2) and resistant (SJSA-1 and MNNG/HOS) osteosarcoma (OS) cell lines,
we showed that miR-34a-5p promotes the multi-drug resistance of OS through the
receptor tyrosine kinase CD117, a direct target of miR-34a-5p. Consistently, the siRNAmediated repression of CD117 in G-292 and MG63.2 cells led to a similar phenotype that
exhibited all of the miR-34a-5p mimic-triggered changes. In addition, the activity of the
MEF2 signaling pathway was drastically altered by the forced changes in the miR-34a5p or CD117 level in OS cells. Furthermore, si-CD117 suppressed the enhanced colony
and sphere formation, which is in agreement with the characteristics of a cancer stem
marker. Taken together, our data established CD117 as a direct target of miR-34-5p
and demonstrated that this regulation interferes with several CD117-mediated effects
on OS cells. In addition to providing new mechanistic insights, our results will provide
an approach for diagnosing and chemotherapeutically treating OS.

dysregulation and cancer stem cell (CSC)-mediated drug
resistance [5]. To date, much effort has been exerted to
analyze the role of miRNAs in the development of drug
resistance in various types of cancers. For instance, a
correlation between the overexpression of miR-21 in
colorectal cancer and decreased sensitivity to fluorouracil
(5-FU) was reported [6]. In addition, miR-130a was upregulated in SKOV3/DDP cells compared with SKOV3
cells, and miR-130a inhibition could overcome cisplatin
resistance by regulating the MDR1/P-gp pathway [7]. The
expression of miR-140 was involved in the drug resistance
to osteosarcoma (OS) xenografts through reduced cell
proliferation via G1 and G2 phase arrest [8].
An association has previously been reported
between miR-34a, a well-studied miRNA, and several

INTRODUCTION
MiRNAs are a class of small non-coding regulatory
RNA molecules that have been shown to be involved in a
wide range of biological processes [1]. The dysregulation
of miRNAs has been associated with the development
of numerous diseases, including cancer. The abnormal
expression of miRNAs in cancer contributes to every
aspect of tumor biology [2, 3], including drug resistance
[4], which remains a major obstacle to effective treatment.
Numerous mechanisms have been found that mediate
drug resistance, including decreased intracellular
drug accumulation, drug inactivation, enhanced DNA
repair, perturbations in signal transduction pathways,
apoptosis and autophagy related drug resistance, miRNA

types of cancer, including Ewing's sarcoma [9] and
colorectal cancer [10], among others. In addition, miR34a-5p has been reported to be a direct transcriptional
target of p53 and is down-regulated in several tumors [11,
12]. Moreover, miR-34a-5p has been found to inhibit cell
invasion and migration in vitro [13–16], which suggested
that miR-34a-5p might play a role in inhibiting tumor
recurrence.
OS is the most common malignant primary bone
tumor in children and adolescents [17, 18], but the
mechanism underlying OS drug resistance remains
unknown. In addition, despite the above extensive studies
on miR-34a-5p, the relationship between miR-34a-5p
and OS drug resistance is still unclear. In this study, we
found that miR-34a-5p promotes multi-drug resistance
in OS cells using a systematic analysis to compare multidrug sensitive (G-292 and MG63.2) OS cell lines to
resistant (SJSA-1 and MNNG/HOS) OS cell lines. We
further showed that miR-34a-5p promotes OS multi-drug
resistance via repression of the CD117 gene, a newly
identified direct target of miR-34a-5p. The CD117 gene
encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) belonging to
the transmembrane RTK family [19] that is involved in
the tumorigenesis of several neoplasms. CD117 can be
expressed in a wide variety of malignant tumors, such as
chronic myeloid leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumor,
malignant melanoma, seminoma, and adenoid cystic
carcinoma of the salivary gland [20].
In this study, we also determined that the MEF2
signaling pathway is affected by miR-34a-5p via
repression of the CD117 gene. The MEF2 signaling
pathway has roles in different tissues through effects on
cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, migration,
shape and metabolism. Altered MEF2 activity plays a
role in human diseases and has been implicated in the
development of several cancer types [21]. Taken together,
our findings will provide a theoretical guide for a clinical
therapy to combat OS drug resistance as well as provide
new mechanistic insights into OS drug resistance.

respectively. In contrast, SJSA-1 and MNNG/HOS were
the most resistant cell lines with relative drug resistance
indexes of 27.11 and 20.53, respectively (Figure 1).
From a RNA-seq-based miR-omic analysis of the G-292,
MG63.2 and SJSA-1 cell lines, we found that more than
twenty miRNAs were differentially expressed by more
than two-fold. Among them, miR-34a-5p was one of the
most differentially expressed miRNAs in these cells. The
expression of miR-34a-5p was relatively higher in SJSA1 and MNNG/HOS cells than in G-292 and MG63.2 cells
(Figure 2A and 2B). The results suggested that miR-34a5p might promote the multi-drug resistance of OS cells.

CD117 is a direct target of miR-34a-5p
in OS cells
To identify the target genes of miR-34a-5p that
are related to the multi-drug resistance of OS cells, we
predicted the target genes of miR-34a-5p using the
following websites: Targetscan, miRDB and microRNA.
org. Several common genes were found, and the
expression of these genes was then measured at both
the mRNA and protein levels. The CD117 gene was
selected for further study mainly because its expression is
correlated with multi-drug resistance, i.e., the CD117 level
was higher in G-292 and MG63.2 cells than in SJSA-1 and
MNNG/HOS cells at both the mRNA and protein levels
(Figure 2C, 2D and 2E).
We then determined the CD117 level in miR34a-5p mimic-transfected G-292 and MG63.2 cells and
antagomiR-transfected SJSA-1 and MNNG/HOS cells for
comparison with the level in the NC (scramble sequence
control)-transfected cells. As shown in Figure 3A and
3B, the transfection of an miR-34a-5p mimic in G-292
and MG63.2 cells increased the miR-34a-5p level to
approximately 5.86- and 19.31-fold, respectively, whereas
the transfection of an miR-34a-5p antagomiR in SJSA-1
and MNNG/HOS cells significantly decreased the miR34a-5p level to 28% and 76%, respectively. Consistent
with the changes of the miR-34a-5p level, the miR-34a5p antagomiR transfection increased both the protein and
mRNA levels of CD117 in SJSA-1 and MNNG/HOS cells
(Figure 3C, 3D and 3E). As expected, transfection of the
miR-34a-5p mimic down-regulated the mRNA and protein
levels of CD117 (Figure 3C, 3D and 3E) compared with
those in the NC-transfected G-292 and MG63.2 cells.
To further confirm that CD117 is a direct target
of miR-34a-5p, we cloned the fragment corresponding
to nucleotides 760-1311 of the wild-type or mutant
3’-untranslated region (UTR) of the CD117 gene at the
downstream of the Renilla luciferase gene in the pGL3control vector (Promega) to create pGL3-CD117 UTR
WT or pGL3-CD117 UTR Mut, respectively (Figure 3F).
These constructs were transfected into G-292, MG63.2,
SJSA-1 and MNNG/HOS cells to determine whether
CD117 is a direct target of miR-34a-5p. We found that

RESULTS
MiR-34a-5p promotes multi-drug resistance
in OS cells
As follows, the drug resistance of seven OS cell
lines (G-292, SJSA-1, MG63.2, MG63, Saos-2, U2OS,
and MNNG/HOS) to doxorubicin (Dox), etoposide (Etop),
methotrexate (MTX), cisplatin (CDDP), and carboplatin
(Carb) was evaluated by IC50 profiling, these drugs are
frequently used for OS therapy. As indicated by the drug
resistance index, G-292 and MG63.2 were the most
multi-drug sensitive cell lines, with the lowest IC50 values
found against Dox, Etop and Carb for G-292 and against
MTX and CDDP for MG63.2; the relative drug resistance
indexes of G-292 and MG63.2 were 1.00 and 1.44,

pGL3-CD117-UTR WT led to significantly higher
luciferase activity in SJSA-1 and MNNG/HOS cells than
in G-292 and MG63.2 cells (Figure 3G). Furthermore, the
luciferase activity of pGL3-CD117-UTR WT, but not that
of the other two constructs, was induced in the antagomiRtransfected SJSA-1 and MNNG/HOS cells and inhibited
in the mimic-transfected G-292 and MG63.2 cells (Figure
3H). Taken together, these results led us to conclude that
CD117 is indeed a direct target of miR-34a-5p and may
play roles in OS drug resistance. These data are consistent
with Siemens et al.’s report [22].

to all tested drugs, except MG63.2 to CDDP. By contrast,
the transfection of the miR-34a-5p antagomiR into SJSA1 or MNNG/HOS cells decreased the drug resistance to
all tested drugs, except SJSA-1 to CDDP (Figure 4A).
The si-CD117 was also transfected into G-292 or MG63.2
cells for testing the drug-resistance effect. The transfection
of si-CD117 indeed decreased the level of CD117 at
both the mRNA and protein level (Figure 4B and 4C).
Following the changes in the CD117 level in G-292 and
MG63.2 cells, the cell death triggered by all five drugs
was reduced, except MG63.2 to MTX and CDDP (Figure
4D). Conversely, transfection of a GFP-tagged CD117
expression construct increased the CD117 protein level
in SJSA-1 and MNNG/HOS cells (Figure 4E). The
resulting drug resistance was significantly decreased for
all five drugs, except MNNG/HOS to Etop and CDDP,
whereas the transfection of only GFP showed a marginal
effect (Figure 4F). In line with its negative effect on drug
resistance (Figure 4D), the siRNA-mediated degradation
of CD117 also reduced the number of apoptotic cells
(Figure 5), this might suggest that the expression of CD117
reduces drug resistance by inhibiting cell proliferation via
G2-phase arrest.

CD117 expression negatively correlates with
drug resistance in OS cells
The functional connection between miR-34a-5p
and the CD117 gene in multi-drug resistance was then
confirmed by comparing the effect on drug-triggered
cell death in G-292 and MG63.2 cells transfected with
the miR-34a-5p mimic and in SJSA-1 and MNNG/HOS
cells transfected with the miR-34a-5p antagomiR. The
transfection of the miR-34a-5p mimic into G-292 or
MG63.2 cells significantly increased the drug resistance

MiR-34a-5p regulates the activities of the MEF2
signaling pathway in the context of OS multidrug resistance

G-292 and SJSA-1 cells. As shown in Figure 5, when the
CD117 level was repressed by a miR-34a-5p mimic or
si-CD117 in G-292 cells, the activities of ATF2/ATF3/
ATF4, cAMP/PKA and MEF2 were all repressed, which
correlates well with the positive regulation of these
pathways by CD117 in G-292 cells (Figure 6C and 6D).
We also transfected SJSA-1 cells with a miR-34a-5p
antagomiR or the GFP-CD117 expression construct and
measured the activities of these six pathways in SJSA-1
cells. Following the increase of the CD117 level, the NFкB pathway was repressed whereas the MEF2 pathway
was activated (Figure 6C and 6D), which is in accordance
with the varying activities of these pathways between
G-292 and SJSA-1 cells. Overall, only the MEF2 pathway
was confirmed to be involved in the OS drug resistance
mediated by the miR-34a-5p repression of the CD117
gene.
We searched for candidate interactions that could
connect CD117 with the master transcription factor, MEF2

To further understand the underlying molecular
mechanisms of OS drug resistance, we used both G-292
and SJSA-1 cells to measure the activities of the following
six cancer-related signaling pathways: p53/DNA damage,
NF-кB, MAPK/ERK, ATF2/ATF3/ATF4, cAMP/PKA
and MEF2 (Figure 6A). The activities of all six pathways
differed by more than two-fold between G-292 and SJSA1 cells, which indicates that they might have a significant
role in OS drug resistance. Among them, two pathways,
p53/DNA damage and NF-кB, showed higher activities in
SJSA-1 cells, whereas the other four pathways, MAPK/
ERK, ATF2/ATF3/ATF4, cAMP/PKA and MEF2,
showed higher activities in G-292 cells (Figure 6B). We
then determined which of the six pathways were also
affected by forced changes in the CD117 level in both

derived tumors was initiated on the tenth day and repeated
five times over 3 days. The intraperitoneal injection of
PBS or Dox began on day 25 in either the G-292 or SJSA1 group and was repeated four times over 3 days (Figure
8A). The tumor mass was weighed at the end of this study.
SJSA-1-derived tumors were approximately 2-fold heavier
than G-292-derived tumors (Figure 8B-8F), suggesting
that miR-34a-5p promotes tumor growth in vivo.
Conversely, an intratumoral injection of the miR-34a-5p
antagomiR into the SJSA-1 cell-derived tumor xenograft
resulted in the opposite phenotype. A similar effect was
observed for agomiR in G-292 tumors. Therefore, miR34a-5p is capable of promoting in vivo tumor growth.
Consistent with the observation that SJSA-1 was
more Dox resistant than G-292 cells in culture (Figure
1), after an intraperitoneal injection of Dox, the G-292
tumors were much smaller than the SJSA-1 tumors
(Figure 8B). Furthermore, the tumor weight for the miR34a-5p antagomiR/Dox in SJSA-1 mice was smaller
than the weight for the miR-34a-5p antagomiR/Mock
counterpart, and the opposite was true for the Dox-treated
group of G-292 cells with or without miR-34a-5p agomiR
transfection (Figure 8C-8F). These results indicated that
miR-34a-5p compromised the tumor-inhibition capability
of Dox.
Further confirmation of the miR-34a-5p role in the
Dox resistance of OS came from the immunohistological

analysis of the CD117 and Ki67 (an indicator of tumor
cell proliferation) in the tumor sections of the Dox-treated
versus PBS-treated mice (Figure 8G). The intratumoral
injection of an miR-34a-5p agomiR (into G-292)/
antagomiR (into SJSA-1) indeed led to the expected
changes in the CD117 level in the tumor sections (Figure
8G), which confirmed that miR-34a-5p has a profound
positive effect on both the growth and drug resistance of
OS cell-derived tumor xenografts in nude mice.

DISCUSSION
Our previous studies have shown that miR-193a-3p
is involved in multi-drug resistance in both hepatocellular
carcinoma [25] and bladder cancer [26, 27] via the repression
of different target genes, including SRSF2, PLAU, HIC2
and LOXL4 [26, 27]. In the present work, we showed that
miR-34a-5p is also involved in the multi-drug resistance of
OS. MiR-34a-5p is up-regulated in multi-chemoresistant
(SJSA-1 and MNNG/HOS) cell lines compared to the
multi-chemosensitive (G-292 and MG63.2) OS cell lines
(Figure 1 and 2). We next performed a comparative RNAseq omic analysis of the SJSA-1, G-292 and MG63.2 cell
lines and identified a panel of genes that are differentially
expressed, including the CD117 gene, which exhibits a
negative correlation with drug resistance (Figure 2). Both

of OS drug resistance were systematically evaluated in both
cultured cells and tumor xenografts in nude mice. Notably,
miR-34a-5p was reported to suppress colorectal cancer
metastasis and inhibit recurrence of colorectal cancer [28].
This suggests that miR-34a-5p might play distinct roles in
different types of cancers. In addition, miR-34a was also
found to inhibit the metastasis of osteosarcoma cells by
repressing the expression of CD44, which indicates that
miR-34a plays a tumor suppressor role [29]. Two different
OS cells, the highly metastatic F5M2 and the low metastatic
F4 cells were used to test the invasion and metastasis. In our
work, we found that miR-34a-5p promotes the multi-drug
resistance of OS by targeting the CD117 gene. Our results

together with previous report suggest that miR-34a might
play multi-functional roles by targeting different genes in the
OS pathology. More investigations are needed to elucidate
the fine regulation mechanism of miR-34a in OS pathology.
The CD117 gene encodes a type III RTK [19] and
is an important mediator/initiator of several signaling
cascades [30]. In addition, CD117 performs numerous
functions in the tumorigenesis of several neoplasms, such
as leukemia [31], glioblastoma [32], melanoma [33],
and lung [34] and breast cancer [35]. Furthermore, a few
studies have suggested that CD117 expression may be
helpful in the differential diagnosis between high-grade
neuroendocrine carcinomas of lungand non–small cell

lung tumors [36, 37]. Despite the extensive studies of
CD117, the role of CD117 in OS remains unclear. In this
study, we clearly demonstrated that the down-regulation
of CD117 mediated by miR-34a-5p might be one of the
reasons for OS drug resistance. CD117 may also regulate
other processes, including cell adhesion, differentiation and
migration, which are significant for cancer development
and treatment [38]. Here, we propose that CD117 mediates
OS drug resistance via the MEF2 signaling pathway. The
MEF2 pathway is activated in several types of cancer
through different mechanisms. The detailed mechanisms
for how CD117 affects the MEF2 pathway and the links
between the MEF2 pathway and OS drug resistance still
need to be elucidated. In addition, for the interaction of
CD117 and miR-34a-5p with numerous signaling pathways,
more detailed analyses are necessary to illuminate the
detailed molecular mechanism of this regulation.
As previously reported, CD117 is a cancer stem
cell marker and thus associated with increased drug
resistance in several human cancers, including OS [39].
To investigate whether miR-34a-5p and CD117 affect
the colony-forming ability of G-292 cells in vitro,
we performed colony-forming and spheroids assays
(supplementary Figure 1). Cells treated with miR-34a-5p
formed clones and spheroids that were more numerous
and larger than those of the control groups. In contrast,
cells treated with si-CD117 formed much smaller clones
and spheroids than did the control groups. As expected,
the addition of the siRNAs for cancer stem markers, siOCT4 or si-NANOG, decreased the size and quantity
of the clones and spheroids. The results suggested that
miR-34a-5p promotes cell proliferation, leading to the
formation of larger clones, which is in accordance with
the drug resistance-promoting effect. To test whether
the promoting effect of miR-34a-5p-mediated cell
proliferation is conducted by OCT4 and NANOG, we
tested the expression levels of OCT4 and NANOG in OS
cells transfected with either miR-34a-5p antagomiR or
mimic. The transfection of miR-34a-5p antagomiR into
SJSA-1 and MNNG/HOS cells significantly increased
the expression of OCT4 and NANOG, whereas the
transfection of miR-34a-5p mimic into G-292 or MG63.2
cells decreased the expression of OCT4 and NANOG
(supplementary Figure 2). OCT4 and NANOG showed
similar expression pattern with CD117 against miR34a-5p antagomiR or mimic, which also indicates
that the promoting effect of miR-34a-5p-mediated
cell proliferation is a complicated event. The detailed
mechanism remains to be clarified. Of note, CD117
showed a promoting effect on cell proliferation similar to
that of the cancer stem cell markers OCT4 and NANOG,
which also suggested that CD117 might function as a
cancer stem marker in OS; however, CD117 showed a
negative regulation of OS drug resistance in this study.
CD117, as a potential cancer stem marker, could also
impair OS drug resistance. More investigations are needed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to elucidate the detailed mechanism for this complicated
regulation in OS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
The following seven OS cell lines were purchased
from ATCC: G-292 (ATCC NO. CRL-1423), SJSA-1
(ATCC NO.CRL-2098), MG63 (ATCC NO.CRL-1427),
Saos-2 (ATCC NO.HTB-85), U2OS (ATCC NO. 40342)
and MNNG/HOS (ATCC NO. 1547). Another cell line,
MG63.2, which was derived from MG63, was kindly
provided by Dr. Luu from the University of Chicago [40].
All of the cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen)
and 1% glutamine at 37°C in 5% CO2.

RNA-seq analysis
RNA-seq analysis was performed by BGI-Tech of
China, and RNA-seq library preparation and sequencing
were performed by BGI (Shenzhen, China). Following
purification, the RNA was fragmented using divalent
cations at an elevated temperature, and first-strand
cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primers
and Superscript TMIII (Invitrogen™, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). Second-strand cDNA was synthesized using
buffer, dNTPs, RNaseH, and DNA polymerase I. Short
fragments were purified with a QiaQuick PCR extraction
kit (Qiagen) and resolved with EB buffer for end repair
and poly (A) addition. The short fragments were
subsequently connected using sequencing adapters. After
agarose gel electrophoresis, suitable fragments were used
as templates for PCR amplification. During the QC steps,
an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and an ABI StepOnePlus
Real-Time PCR System were used for the quantification
and qualification of the sample library. Finally, the
library (200 bp insert) was sequenced using an Illumina
HiSeq 2000 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The
single-end library was prepared following the protocol
of the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit
(Illumina) [41].

RNA analysis
Total RNA was isolated from the cells at the
logarithmic phase using Trizol (Tiangen Biotech Co.,
Ltd., Beijing, China). For the mRNA analysis, cDNA
primed by oligo-dT was made with a prime Script RT
reagent kit (Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China),
and the mRNA level of the CD117 gene was quantified
using duplex-qRT-PCR analysis where the Taqman probes
with different fluorescence for β-actin (provided by Shing
Gene, Shanghai, China) were used in the FTC-3000P
28430

Oncotarget

PCR instrument (Funglyn Biotech Inc., Canada). Using
the 2−ΔΔCt method, normalization to the β-actin level was
performed before the relative levels of the target genes
were compared. The sequences of the primers and probes
used for the qRT-PCR analysis are:
hCD117 F: 5′- AATATGAAGCATTCCCCAAACC-3′
hCD117 R: 5′- CTTCGGTGCCTTTTAATCTCG-3′
hCD117 probe: 5′-CY5- CACCAGCAGTGGATCT

kit were supplied by Guangzhou Ribobio, China. The
expression construct for CD117 (EX-Z4357-M98)
with a GFP tag was supplied by Guangzhou Fulengen,
China. Transfection of both ribonucleic acid reagents
or plasmids mentioned in this paper and the reporter
plasmids in Cignal Finder™ Pathway Reporter Arrays
(SABiosciences, USA) was performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The sequences used in this
study are as follows:
si-CD117:
5’-GGAUGAAACGAAUGAGAAU dTdT-3’
3’-dTdT CCUACUUUGCUUACUCUUA-5’
hsa-miR-34a-5p
antagomiR: 5’ACAACCAGCUAAGACACUGCCA 3’
mimics:
sense 5’UGGCAGUGUCUUAGCUGGUUGU 3’
antisense 5’ACAACCAGCUAAGACACUGCCA 3’
Chemically modified mimic oligonucleotides
(agomiR) were synthesized to regulate the miR-34a-5p
expression in vivo. The 3′ end of the oligonucleotides
was conjugated to cholesterol, and all of the bases were
2′-OMe modified. The agomiR oligonucleotides were
deprotected, desalted and purified by high-performance
liquid chromatography.

Bulge-Loop™ miRNA qRT-PCR
For detecting and quantifying the expression of
specific miRNAs, RNA was reverse transcribed using a
Bulge-Loop™ miRNA qRT-PCR Primer Set (Ribobio) and
quantified by SYBR Green-based real-time PCR analysis
in the FTC-3000P (FUNGLYN BIOTECH INC., Canada).
The Ct values of the target miRs were normalized to the Ct
values of U6 RNA before quantification using the 2−ΔΔCt
method.

Chemotherapeutics

Luciferase reporter assay

The chemotherapeutic drugs used in this paper
are of clinical grade [26, 42, 43] (NCI Dictionary of
Cancer Terms, http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary), Dox:
doxorubicin (Haizheng, Zhejiang, China); Etop: etoposide
(Hengrui, Jiangsu, China); MTX: Methotrexate (Lingnan,
Guangdong, China); CDDP: cisplatin (Haosen, Jiangsu,
China) and Carb: carboplatin (Qilu, Shandong, China).

A portion of the CD117 3’-UTR (552 bp, 760-1311
from a 2172-bp full length sequence) combined with the
target sequence or the mutant target sequence for miR34a-5p was cloned into the 3’ end of the luciferase-coding
sequence of pGL3 (Invitrogen) to construct pGL3-lucCD117 WT and pGL3-luc-CD117 Mut, respectively. The
constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cells were
seeded in 96-well plates at approximately 1×104 cells per
well and transfected with a mixture of 50 ng of pGL3-luc
CD117 WT or Mut, 5 ng of Renilla plus 5 pmol of mimic
or NC nucleotides, with the riboFECT CP transfection
kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Both the
firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured 24
hr after transfection using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter
Assay System (Promega) and a Promega GloMax 20/20
luminometer. The relative firefly luciferase activities of
the UTR construct and pathway reporter constructs were
analyzed as previously reported [26].

Drug resistance profiling (IC50 determination)
For a thiazolyl blue tetrazolium blue (MTT)-based
cell proliferation assay, cells in the logarithmic phase
of growth were seeded in triplicate in 96-well plates at a
density of 0.5×104 cells/well and treated with 4-fold serially
diluted drugs for 72 hr. Then, 10 μl (5 mg/ml) of MTT salt
(Sigma) was added to the corresponding well, the cells were
incubated at 37°C for an additional 4 hr, and the reaction
was stopped by lysing the cells with 150 μl of DMSO for 10
min. The optical density was measured at 570 nm. Both the
linear regression parameters and the IC50 (the concentration
of drug required to kill 50% of the cells) values with the nodrug control as the reference were calculated. The relative
drug resistance was presented as the fold change in the IC50
of the cell lines relative to the lowest IC50.

Signaling pathway analysis
Constructs for the reporters of six signaling pathway,
p53/DNA damage, NF-κB, MAPK/ERK, cAMP/PKA,
ATF2/ATF3/ATF4 and MEF2 pathways, were obtained
from SABiosciences (USA) and analyzed according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the cells were
transfected in triplicate with each firefly luciferase reporter
construct in combination with the Renilla luciferase-based
control construct using the riboFECT CP transfection
reagent, and both the luciferase activities were measured

in the cell extracts 24 hr after transfection. The luciferase
activities (luciferase unit) of the pathway reporter relative
to those of the negative control in the transfected cells
were calculated as a measurement of the pathway activity.

SJSA-1-generated tumors on the left back of the nude
mice were intratumorally injected with 2 nM miR-34a5p antagomiR, and the six tumors on the right back were
injected with 2 nM Mock. G-292-generated tumors on the
left backs of nude mice were injected with 4 nM miR-34a5p agomiR, and the six tumors on the right of the backs
were injected with 4 nM Mock. These injections were
repeated five times in 3 days. Three mice from SJSA-1
and 3 from G-292 intraperitoneally received Dox (2.5 mg/
kg) once in 3 days. The remaining 6 mice (3 from SJSA1 and 3 from G-292) received phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) as a mock treatment control, and these injections
were repeated four times. The mice were humanely
sacrificed on day 40, and the tumors were weighed and
photographed. The tumor weight was reported as the mean
± S.D.
The expression of CD117 protein was measured
using immunochemical analysis of 5-mm slices of
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor xenografts
from the nude mice. To avoid inter-treatment bias,
the tissue slides from all six groups were placed on a
single slide and simultaneously subjected to the same
immunostaining. Antigens were retrieved by pretreating
dewaxed sections in a microwave oven at 750 watts for 5
min in citrate buffer (pH 6) and processed with the Super
Sensitive Link-Labeled Detection System (Biogenex,
Menarini, Florence, Italy). The enzymatic activities
were determined using 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Dako,
Milan, Italy) as a chromogenic substrate. Following
counterstaining with Mayer hematoxylin (Invitrogen),
the slides were mounted in aqueous mounting medium
(glycergel, Dako). Pictures were taken usinga LEICA DM
4000B microscope, the relative level of each protein was
calculated using LEICA software, and the percentage of
Mock-treated relative to chemotherapeutic-treated tumors
was calculated and plotted. The animal study proposal
was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) of the University of Science and
Technology of China. All of the mouse experimental
procedures were performed in accordance with the
Regulations for the Administration of Affairs Concerning
Experimental Animals approved by the State Council of
People’s Republic of China.

Apoptosis analysis
Cells were harvested and rinsed with PBS twice.
Then, 5 μl of FITC-labeled enhanced annexin V and 5 μl
(20 μg/ml) of propidium iodide were added to a 100 μl
cell suspension. After incubation in the dark for 15 min at
room temperature, the samples were diluted with 100 μl of
PBS. Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur
instrument. The results were analyzed according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The experiments were
performed independently three times, and a representative
is shown.

Western blot analysis of protein
Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (60 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.25% bromophenol blue,
and 1.25% 2-mercaptoethanol) and heated at 100°C for 10
min before electrophoresis. Anti-CD117 (AM2137b) was
purchased from Abgent, and anti-GAPDH (AM1020a)
and HRP goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (LP1002a) were
provided by Wuxiphama, Shanghai, China. The target
bands were revealed by an enhanced chemiluminescence
reaction (Pierce), and the density (level) of the proteins
relative to the GAPDH band was quantified using a GelPro Analyzer (Media Cybernetics).

Bioinformatics analysis
CD117 and a representative gene, MEF2, in the
MEF2 pathway were used as query genes to predict
potential interactions using the GeneMANIA database
(http://genemania.org/). GeneMANIA uses a fast heuristic
algorithm to integrate functional association networks
containing all input genes. To simplify the model, the
shortest paths between query genes were extracted from
the networks. We first chose the interactions reported in
the literature to obtain the true functional role of each
interaction in the connected network of all query genes.

Sphere formation assay

In vivo studies

For induction of sphere formation, the G-292 cells
were transfected with either a miR-34a-5p mimic or
control oligo. after 24 hr, the cells were trypsinized, and
1×104 cells were seeded in a six-well plate coated with
attachment-preventing PolyHEMA (Sigma) using a 3
ml of sphere medium consisting of DMEM-F12 (Gibco)
supplemented with B27 supplement (1:50, Gibco), EGF
(20 ng/ml, Invitrogen), and bFGF (20 ng/ ml, Invitrogen),
which was added to the medium every 3 days. Then, the
sphere formation experiment was performed. The number
of colonies larger than 50 μm in diameter was determined

Animal experiments were undertaken in accordance
with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals. BALB/c male nude
miceof 3-4 weeks of age were used for this study. SJSA-1
or G-292 cells were embedded in BD Matrigel™ Matrix
(Becton, Dickinson, NJ, USA) and subcutaneously
injected into the two sites on the backs of mice as
follows: 4×106 cells/site for SJSA-1, 1×107 cells/site for
G-292, 2 sites/mouse, 6 mice for SJSA-1, and 6 mice
for G-292. From the 10th day after cell injection, all six
