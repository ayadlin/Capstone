BACKGROUND: The discovery of new, effective non–anthracycline-based reinduction regimens for children with recurrent acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is critical. In this phase 1/2 study, the tolerability and overall response rate of clofarabine in combination with
cytarabine was investigated in children with recurrent/refractory AML. METHODS: AAML0523 enrolled 49 children with AML in first
recurrence or who were refractory to induction therapy. The study consisted of a dose-finding phase (9 patients) and an efficacy
phase (40 patients). Two children received clofarabine at a dose of 40 mg/m2/day and 47 children at a dose of 52 mg/m2/day.
RESULTS: Toxicities typical for intensive chemotherapy regimens were observed at all doses of clofarabine. The recommended pediatric phase 2 dose of clofarabine in combination with cytarabine was 52 mg/m2/day for 5 days. Of 48 evaluable patients, the overall
response rate (complete remission plus complete remission with partial platelet recovery) was 48%. Four patients met conventional
criteria for complete remission with incomplete count recovery. Twenty-one of 23 responders subsequently underwent hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation. The overall survival rate at 3 years was 46% for responders compared with 16% for nonresponders
(P <.001). Patients found to have no minimal residual disease at the end of the first cycle by flow cytometric analysis had superior
overall survival after 1 year (100% vs 38%; P 5.01). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of clofarabine and cytarabine yielded an acceptable response rate without excess toxicity in children with recurrent AML. The nearly 50% survival rate reported in responders is highly
encouraging in these high-risk patients and suggests that this combination is an effective bridge to hematopoietic stem cell transC 2014 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Cure rates for children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have dramatically improved with the advent of
anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens and improvements in supportive care.1,2 Nevertheless, approximately
50% of children still develop disease recurrence with resistant disease. It is critical to develop effective non–
anthracycline-based reinduction regimens to avoid further risk of cardiotoxicity while allowing for curative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Clofarabine is a second-generation purine nucleoside analog designed to integrate the mechanistic properties of fludarabine and cladribine.3 Clofarabine requires intracellular phosphorylation by
deoxycytidine kinase to the active triphosphate form (clo-CTP) before inhibition of DNA polymerase.4,5 Clofarabine
has shown single-agent activity in phase 1 and 2 studies in pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and AML.6,7
Clofarabine is a potent inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, leading to increased accumulation of the cytotoxic triphosphate form of cytarabine (ara-CTP) in leukemia cells. This biochemical modulation is well established in vitro and
has been studied in clinical trials in adults with AML.8-10

Clofarabine and Cytarabine in Recurrent Pediatric AML/Cooper et al

In the current study, we have described the findings
of the AML stratum of the Children’s Oncology Group
(COG) phase 1/2 study AAML0523. The primary objective of this study was to define the overall response rate
(ORR) to clofarabine in combination with cytarabine in
children with recurrent or refractory AML or ALL. The
current study reports only the results for children with
recurrent AML; the findings for children with ALL have
been published previously.11
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

AAML0523 was open to accrual between March 12,
2007 and January 5, 2012. Data analyses for patients
with AML were current as of September 30, 2012.
Patients with AML were required to be aged 1 to 21
years, and in first recurrence or with disease that was refractory to reinduction. Patients were required to have
histologically proven AML according to the FrenchAmerican-British classification system and  5% bone
marrow blasts. Other requirements included adequate
liver (serum bilirubin  1.5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] for age, alanine aminotransferase  2.5 times
the ULN for age), renal (derived from the Schwartz formula), cardiac (echocardiogram with a shortening
fraction  27%), and pancreatic function (serum amylase
and lipase  1.5 times the ULN), and adequate performance status (Karnofsky or Lansky  50%). Exclusion criteria included uncontrolled systemic infection and active
central nervous system involvement. Due to the severe
hepatotoxicity observed in a concurrent pediatric clinical
trial in patients with recurrent ALL receiving treatment
with concurrent clofarabine, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide,12 AAML0523 was amended to exclude patients
who had undergone HSCT within 12 months of study
entry. Institutional Review Boards at participating centers approved the study, and participating patients or
their parents provided written informed consent. The
original clinical trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.
gov as NCT00372619.
Study Design

The study was conducted in 2 phases: a dose-finding
phase and an efficacy phase. The dose-finding phase consisted of a single dose escalation/deescalation of clofarabine in combination with a fixed dose of cytarabine (1 g/
m2/day for 5 days). For each dose level, 10 patients (with
both ALL and AML) were enrolled. The first cohort
received clofarabine at a dose of 40 mg/m2/day for 5 days.
Based on safety data from the first cohort, the dose of cloCancer

August 15, 2014

farabine would either be escalated to 52 mg/m2/day or
deescalated to a dose of 30 mg/m2/day. The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) was used in the efficacy
portion of the study with separate ALL and AML cohorts.
An optimal 2-stage Simon design was implemented to test
the null hypothesis that the ORR (complete remission
[CR] plus complete remission with partial platelet recovery [CRp]) is  40% versus the alternative hypothesis that
the ORR is  60% based on the ORR from the Children’s Cancer Group 2951 study.13 Eighteen patients were
to be enrolled in the first stage; if at least 8 overall
responses were observed, an additional 28 patients would
be enrolled in the second stage. The null hypothesis would
be rejected if at least 23 overall responses were observed in
patients treated at a dose of 52 mg/m2/dose. Patients who
received therapy at the RP2D in the first phase were
included in the efficacy phase.
Treatment Plan

Induction therapy consisted of up to 2 cycles. If a bone
marrow aspirate (BMA) performed between day 14 and
day 21 of the first cycle revealed  5% blasts, cycle 2 was
administered without waiting for count recovery. BMA
was repeated at least once every 14 days, until response
assessment was possible. If the day 14 to day 21 BMA
revealed < 5% blasts, patients received therapy once they
attained adequate peripheral blood count recovery,
defined as an absolute neutrophil count(ANC) > 1000/
lL and a platelet count > 100,000/lL. Patients without
ANC recovery by day 42 were to proceed to cycle 2 if
there was no bone marrow aplasia noted. In the dosefinding phase, cycle 1 consisted of clofarabine on days 2 to
6 and cytarabine on days 1 to 5 for correlative study purposes. Correlative biology studies will be described in a
separate article. In the efficacy phase of the study, both
clofarabine and cytarabine were administered intravenously (iv) over 2 hours on days 1 to 5. Cytarabine was
administered beginning 4 hours after the initiation of clofarabine. Because systemic inflammatory response is a
known side effect of clofarabine,6,7 patients experiencing
respiratory distress, unexplained hypotension, or tachycardia were to receive iv hydrocortisone pretreatment (50100 mg/m2/day) before each clofarabine dose for remainder of that cycle. Prophylactic intrathecal cytarabine was
administered to all patients at the time of diagnostic lumbar puncture or on day 0 of cycle 1 (at least 24 hours
before administration of iv cytarabine). On the first day of
cycle 2, patients were allowed to receive intrathecal cytarabine dosed according to age, at the discretion of the treating physician.

Response Criteria

The ORR consisted of patients who achieved a CR and a
CRp. Criteria did not include those with CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi). Response was considered as the best response after up to 2 induction cycles.
CR was defined as attainment of an M1 bone marrow (<
5% blasts) with an ANC of > 1000/lL and a platelet
count of > 100,000/lL. CRp was defined as attainment
of an M1 bone marrow (< 5% blasts) with recovery of an
ANC > 1000/lL and platelet transfusion independence,
which was defined as no platelet transfusions for 1 week.
Stable disease (SD) was defined as being present when a
patient did not qualify for either a CR, CRp, or progressive disease (PD). PD was defined as an increase in the
extent of bone marrow infiltration by leukemic cells
of  20% blasts or extramedullary disease.
Detection of Minimal Residual Disease

Response to initial therapy was assessed by multidimensional flow cytometry (MDF) as previously described.14
Samples were to be collected at the time of study entry, at
2484

the end of induction 1, and at the end of induction 2. The
detection threshold of residual disease has been demonstrated to be 0.01%.14
Statistical Analysis

Data were analyzed through September 30, 2012. If therapy was associated with a 40% ORR after up to 2 cycles of
therapy, the null hypothesis (40% ORR) would be
rejected in the 2-stage design with a probability of .10. If
therapy was associated with a 60% ORR, the null hypothesis would be rejected in the 2-stage design with a probability of .90. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to
estimate overall survival (OS), which was defined as time
from study entry until death, and the log-rank test was
used to compare OS. Patients who were alive at the time
of last follow-up were censored for OS analyses at the date
of last contact. Patients defined as responders (best
response of CR or CRp) were compared with nonresponders. The significance of observed difference in percentages was tested using the chi-square test and Fisher
exact test when data were sparse comparing groups of

RESULTS
Study Population

As outlined in Table 1, a total of 51 patients were enrolled
on AAML0523, 49 of whom were eligible for response
assessment. Of the 49 eligible patients, 44 were in first
morphologic recurrence and 5 had disease that was refractory to induction chemotherapy. Patients in first recurrence had a median length of initial CR of 306 days
(range, 55 days-2212 days), with 27 patients (61%) having developed disease recurrence within 1 year of achieving their initial CR. Of 40 patients with cytogenetic data,
3 (7.5%) had high-risk cytogenetics (monosomy 7 and
del(5q0)), 11 patients had core-binding factor
AML (27.5%), 4 had 11q23 abnormalities (10%), and
4 patients had extra copies of chromosome 8 (10%).
Toxicity

Nonhematologic toxicities of grade 3 and higher as defined
in the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3) were collected for all
patients. Those toxicities occurring in > 1 individual at clofarabine doses of 40 mg/m2 and 52 mg/m2 are included in
Table 2. Toxicity data regarding 20 patients (including 2
patients with AML who were treated at a dose of 40 mg/m2
and 7 patients with AML who were treated at a dose of 52
mg/m2) treated in the dose-finding portion of the study
have been published previously.11 There were no doselimiting toxicities (DLTs) for the 2 patients with AML
who were treated at a dose of 40 mg/m2, whereas 1 patient
with AML who was treated at a dose of 52 mg/m2
Cancer

experienced a DLT (bone marrow aplasia, grade 4 hypokalemia, grade 3 nausea, and grade 3 dehydration). Therefore, the recommended dose of clofarabine for the efficacy
portion (RP2D) of AAML0523 was 52 mg/m2. The most
common toxicities were infection, nausea/diarrhea/anorexia, fever/neutropenia, transaminitis, hyperglycemia, and
hypokalemia, which are consistent with prior studies on
clofarabine. No deaths occurred among patients with AML
within 30 days of protocol therapy.
Of 47 patients with AML treated at the RP2D, 12
had ANC recovery (> 1000/lL) and 16 had platelet recovery ( 100,000/lL) after cycle 1 at a median of 29.5 days
and 26.5 days, respectively. Of those who received a second
cycle, the median times to ANC recovery (15 patients) and
platelet recovery (16 patients) were 35 days and 27.5 days,
respectively. The remainder of the patients who did not
have ANC recovery (35 patients) or platelet recovery (31
patients) after 1 cycle of therapy had median cycle lengths
of 23 days and 29 days, respectively. Of 30 patients who
received cycle 2 at the RP2D, 18 patients did not have
ANC recovery (4 of whom achieved SD), platelet recovery
(3 of whom achieved CRp), or both (6 with PD and 5 with
SD). Of these 18 patients, 7 received more chemotherapy
and HSCT, 4 underwent HSCT only, 6 received chemotherapy only, and 1 did not receive additional therapy.

the RP2D in the first stage of the 2-stage design to proceed to the second stage. A total of 46 evaluable patients
were treated at the RP2D, 16 of whom achieved CR and 5
of whom achieved a CRp for an ORR of 45.7% (95%
confidence interval, 30.9%-61.0%). The 2 patients with
AML who were treated on the dose-finding portion of the
study at a dose of 40 mg/m2 responded (1 with CR and
1 with CRp), thus increasing the response rate for all
patients with AML to 48%. Of 23 responders, 11 (48%)
had SD after the first course and then achieved CR or
CRp after cycle 2. However, 6 patients were removed
from protocol therapy by their physician after the first
cycle after achieving SD. Not included among responders
were 4 patients with SD who achieved CRi, defined as
having fulfilled criteria for bone marrow CR but without
recovery of their ANC (< 1.0 3 109/L) and platelet count
(< 100 3 109/L). All 4 patients with CRi proceeded to
undergo HSCT and only 1 patient was alive at the time of
last follow-up. There were 30 patients who received cycle
2 at the RPD2. Fifteen patients received a bone marrow
evaluation between days 14 and 21 and 16 patients at day
23 or later. Response by length of first CR (CR1) is
reported in Table 4 and is consistent with previous studies
demonstrating that a CR1 of < 1 year predicts poor
response.15
Characteristics of Responders

The clinical features of all responders are listed in Table 5.
Responders generally had lower-risk features including a
2486

longer median duration of CR1 (374.5 days vs 258 days;
P 5 .085) and a higher percentage of favorable cytogenetics (40% vs 15%; P 5 .077). There were responses noted
in higher-risk patients, because 4 of 12 patients with an
initial CR of < 6 months achieved CR (1 patient) or CRp
(3 patients). In addition, there were responses in a patient
with monosomy 7, and 2 with 11q23 rearrangement. Of
23 responders, 21 proceeded to HSCT (10 after the first
cycle and 11 after 2 cycles) compared with 12 of 25 nonresponders. For these patients, responses were found to be
durable, with a 3-year OS rate of 46% 6 27% compared
with 16% 6 16% in nonresponders. (P < .001) (Fig. 1).
Minimal Residual Disease

Of 46 evaluable patients at the RP2D, specimens for
MRD evaluation after the end of induction 1 (EOI1)
were submitted for 13 patients, 3 of whom were in morphologic CR/CRp and 10 of whom had SD or PD. In
these 13 patients, 8 had disease that was detectable by
MDF after the first course (62%) (Table 6). Six of 8
patients who were positive for MRD at EOI1 had died at
the time of last follow-up, whereas all the patients without
MRD were alive. Of 10 patients with morphologic SD or
PD at EOI1, 3 were negative for MRD, all of whom were
long-term survivors compared with only 1 of 7 patients
found to have MRD (14%). This suggests that MDF may
provide clinically relevant data beyond morphology.
MDF data at the EOI2 were available for 10 patients with
an MRD rate of 40%. All patients without evidence of

DISCUSSION
Cure rates in children with AML in first recurrence are
poor, especially among those who develop disease recurCancer

rence within 1 year of therapy.13,16 An important factor
directing therapy after disease recurrence is prior anthracycline exposure, because the majority of children treated
on current COG AML protocols have a cumulative
anthracycline exposure of approximately 440 mg/m2.
Emerging data have revealed a significant risk of cardiovascular death in pediatric survivors of AML.17,18 Therefore, effective non–anthracycline-based reinduction
regimens are desperately needed to decrease treatmentrelated morbidities.
AAML0523 demonstrated that the combination of
clofarabine and cytarabine is an active non–anthracyclinebased chemotherapy regimen for children with AML in
first recurrence. The combination proved to be an effective bridge to more definitive therapy, with 21 of 23 responders proceeding to HSCT. The significance of this
“bridge to transplant” is demonstrated by the 3-year OS
rate of 46% 6 27% for responders versus 16% 6 16% for
nonresponders (P < .001) (Fig. 1). Although the ORR in
the current study (45.7% at RP2D, 48% overall) was suboptimal, nonadherence to protocol recommendations
may have affected the results. Because single-agent clofarabine trials have demonstrated that many patients
required > 1 cycle to achieve best response,6,7 the protocol

recommended that patients receive 2 cycles of protocol
therapy. Of those patients in compliance with this recommendation, 11 (48% of responders) with SD after the first
cycle achieved CR or CRp after cycle 2. However, 6
patients (29%) with SD after the first course were
removed from protocol therapy by treating physicians
without receiving a second cycle. In addition, 4 patients
met conventional criteria for CRi, but came off the study
before meeting parameters for CR or CRp. These 4
patients proceeded to undergo HSCT but only 25% were
alive at the time of last follow-up. It is possible that
improved protocol compliance may have resulted in an
improved response rate. It is interesting to note that 2
patients with acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage were
treated on study and both responded. The toxicity profile
of this combination was consistent with other cytotoxic
AML reinduction regimens, without unexpected grade 3
or 4 toxicities. After 2 DLTs identified as fungal infections
in the phase 1 portion of the study (both in patients with
ALL), the supportive care guidelines were amended to
include antifungal prophylaxis. Venoocclusive disease, a
concern with the combination of clofarabine, etoposide,
and cyclophosphamide, was not observed on this study.
Results from Children’s Cancer Group 2951 study demonstrated that the combination of mitoxantrone and
cytarabine in children with recurrent/refractory AML
achieved an ORR of 58% (unpublished data).13 Patients
generally received less-intensive therapy and fewer cumulative anthracyclines compared with those treated on
AAML0523. In addition, the majority of patients on
AAML0523 had already received the combination of
2488

mitoxantrone and cytarabine, and therefore the response
rate in the current study is not surprising. The combination of fludarabine and cytarabine has recently demonstrated efficacy in patients with recurrent pediatric
AML.15 Kaspers et al recently published their results of a
randomized study of fludarabine, cytarabine, and
granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor (FLAG) versus
FLAG with liposomal daunorubicin.15 Randomizing
394 patients aged > 10 years who developed disease recurrence after a variety of de novo therapeutic regimens,
the CR rate (ANC > 1000/lL and a platelet
count > 50,000/lL) after 2 cycles was 69% with the
combination of FLAG and liposomal daunorubicin, and
59% with FLAG alone (P 5 .07). In this trial, every responder received 2 cycles whereas many patients on
AAML0523 did not, a finding that reemphasizes an important potential confounding factor in the response
rates of patients in the current study to the combination
of clofarabine and cytarabine.
The results of the current study demonstrate that the
quality of remission achieved by salvage chemotherapy, as
defined by MDF, impacts long-term survival. The use of
MDF for the assessment of response is well-established in
predicting outcome in children with de novo
AML.14,19,20 In COG study AAML03P1, nearly onethird of patients in morphologic CR were found to have
residual disease by MDF and had a significantly higher
rate of disease recurrence. Conversely, this same study
revealed that nearly 25% of the patients in morphologic
failure (> 5% blasts) had no evidence of disease by MDF.
This lack of immunophenotypic disease correlated with

favorable outcome, highlighting the difficulty in distinguishing normal regenerating cells from leukemic blasts
by morphology alone.14 Given the paucity of available
data, the usefulness of MRD by MDF in the setting of
recurrent AML is unclear. All submitted samples were
evaluated for MRD. However, the number of optional
biology samples was limited because the majority of
patients had received a bone marrow examination to confirm disease recurrence before providing consent for trial
participation. There were no significant differences noted
in response when comparing those who received MRD
testing with those who did not. Despite the limited sample size, there was a statistically significant difference in 1year OS from the end of the first cycle between patients
who were negative for MRD (100%) versus patients who
were positive for MRD (38%) (P 5 0.01). This suggests
that MDF may provide a valuable tool in response assessment in patients with recurrent disease, and further supports the need for accurate and sensitive response
assessment beyond morphologic response in the setting of
retrieval regimens. This will allow for improved patient
care and facilitate the more rapid evaluation of new agents
under study based on MDF data as a surrogate marker.
In conclusion, the results of the current study demonstrated that the non–anthracycline-based combination
of clofarabine and cytarabine has clinically significant activity in pediatric patients with refractory/recurrent AML.
The durability of these responses and the relatively high
3-year OS rate of 46% indicate that this combination is
an effective therapy as a bridge to HSCT in this patient
population.
