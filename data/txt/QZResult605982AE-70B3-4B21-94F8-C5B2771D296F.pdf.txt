Abstract
Bisphosphonates bind avidly to bone mineral and are potent
inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone destruction. They also
exhibit antitumor activity in vitro. Here, we used a mouse
model of human breast cancer bone metastasis to examine the
effects of risedronate and NE-10790, a phosphonocarboxylate
analogue of the bisphosphonate risedronate, on osteolysis and
tumor growth. Osteolysis was measured by radiography and
histomorphometry. Tumor burden was measured by fluorescence imaging and histomorphometry. NE-10790 had a 70-fold
lower bone mineral affinity compared with risedronate. It was
7-fold and 8,800-fold less potent than risedronate at reducing,
respectively, breast cancer cell viability in vitro and bone loss
in ovariectomized animals. We next showed that risedronate
given at a low dosage in animals bearing human B02-GFP
breast tumors reduced osteolysis by inhibiting bone resorption, whereas therapy with higher doses also inhibited skeletal
tumor burden. Conversely, therapy with NE-10790 substantially reduced skeletal tumor growth at a dosage that did not
inhibit osteolysis, a higher dosage being able to also reduce
bone destruction. The in vivo antitumor activity of NE-10790
was restricted to bone because it did not inhibit the growth of
subcutaneous B02-GFP tumor xenografts nor the formation of
B16-F10 melanoma lung metastases. Moreover, NE-10790, in
combination with risedronate, reduced both osteolysis and
skeletal tumor burden, whereas NE-10790 or risedronate alone
only decreased either tumor burden or osteolysis, respectively.
In conclusion, our study shows that decreasing the bone
mineral affinity of bisphosphonates is an effective therapeutic
strategy to inhibit skeletal tumor growth in vivo. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Cancer cells that metastasize to the skeleton are, on their own,
rarely able to destroy bone (1). Instead, they stimulate the function
of bone-degrading cells, the osteoclasts, leading to the formation of
osteolytic lesions (1). In this respect, bisphosphonate drugs are
potent inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and have
shown clinical utility in the palliative treatment of patients with
osteolytic metastases (2).

Chemically, bisphosphonates are all characterized by two
phosphonate groups linked to a central carbon atom, forming a
P-C-P structure (3). Two chains (called R1 and R2) are covalently
bound to the carbon atom of the common P-C-P structure. This
common backbone and the R1 side chain (preferably a hydroxyl
group) allow bisphosphonates to bind avidly to hydroxyapatite
crystals in the skeleton (3). The R2 side chain determines the
potency of bisphosphonates to inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone
resorption (3). Bisphosphonates that lack a nitrogen functional
group in the R2 side chain (e.g., etidronate or clodronate) cause the
intracellular accumulation of nonhydrolyzable, cytotoxic ATP
analogues that subsequently induce osteoclast apoptosis (3).
Bisphosphonates with an R2 side chain containing a nitrogen
atom either in an alkyl chain (e.g., pamidronate, alendronate,
ibandronate) or within a heterocyclic ring (e.g., risedronate or
zoledronate) target osteoclast farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase,
a key enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, and inhibit its activity to
varying degrees, depending on the overall molecular structure of
these nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (4). The inhibition of
FPP synthase activity by nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates
leads to impaired prenylation and prevents correct function of
small GTPases that are essential for osteoclast activity (3).
There is now extensive in vivo preclinical evidence that
bisphosphonates can reduce skeletal tumor burden and inhibit
the formation of bone metastases in animal models (5). Several
mechanisms have been proposed to explain these observations. For
example, bisphosphonates may render the bone a less favorable
microenvironment for tumor cell colonization by reducing
osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, which, in turn, deprives
tumor cells of bone-derived growth factors that are required for
tumor cell proliferation (5). In addition, bisphosphonates seem to
have direct antitumor effects (5). They have been shown to inhibit
tumor cell adhesion, invasion, and proliferation, and they induce
apoptosis of a variety of human tumor cell lines in vitro (5).
Inhibition of the prenylation of small GTPases in tumor cells is
thought to be responsible for many of the observed in vitro
antitumor effects of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (5).
However, whereas bisphosphonates clearly exhibit a direct antitumor potential, these drugs that are used for the treatment of
patients with skeletal metastases to date have shown no
convincing antitumor effects (2). Thus, it is important to define
new strategies to optimize the direct antitumor properties of
bisphosphonates in vivo.
We have previously shown that soluble bisphosphonates are
significantly more potent than mineral-bound bisphosphonates at
inhibiting tumor cell adhesion to bone in vitro (6). Moreover, it has
been recently reported that osteoclasts internalize bisphosphonates from bone, whereas nonresorbing breast cancer cells only
take up small amounts of these bisphosphonates that become

available due to their natural desorption from the bone surface (7).
Overall, these findings (6, 7) suggest that the higher the affinity of a
bisphosphonate is for bone mineral, the more limited their direct
antitumor potential is in vivo. Therefore, we reasoned that a
bisphosphonate possessing weak bone mineral affinity could be
released in higher concentration near the bone mineral surface and
might act directly on tumor cells that reside in the bone marrow.
To address this question, we used a phosphonocarboxylate
analogue of risedronate, NE-10790, in which one of the phosphonate groups of the P-C-P moiety is replaced with a carboxyl group.
NE-10790 has a low bone mineral affinity and a poor antiresorptive
activity in vitro and in the Schenk growing rat model (8, 9). In
addition, this compound inhibits breast and prostate cancer cell
invasion and induces apoptosis of myeloma cells in vitro (10, 11). At
the molecular level, NE-10790 does not inhibit FPP synthase activity but blocks Rab geranylgeranyl transferase in several cell types,
including osteoclasts, macrophages, and myeloma cells (11, 12).
Here, using a mouse model of human breast cancer bone metastasis, we compared the effects of risedronate and NE-10790 on
osteolysis and skeletal tumor growth.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435s, MCF-7, Hs 578T, T-47D, and
ZR-75-1 human breast cancer cell lines were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection-LGC Promochem. The MDA-MB-231/B02 human
breast cancer cell line is a subpopulation of the MDA-MB-231 cancer line
that was selected for the high efficiency with which it metastasizes to bone
after i.v. inoculation (13). Tumor cells were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640
(Invitrogen) or a-MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heatinactivated FCS (Invitrogen) and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air.
Drugs and reagents. Risedronate [2-(3-pyridinyl)1-hydroxyethylidenebisphosphonic acid] and NE-10790 [2-(3-pyridinyl)1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1phosphonocarboxylic acid] were obtained from Procter and Gamble
Pharmaceuticals. These drugs were resuspended in PBS or cell culture
medium and stored at 4jC. All transgeranylgeraniol (GGOH) was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, diluted at (101 mol/L) in absolute ethanol, and stored
at 20jC.
Measurement of the bone mineral affinity of risedronate and NE10790. Binding affinity constants (K L) for the adsorption of risedronate and
NE-10790 were calculated from kinetic studies on hydroxyapatite crystal
growth using Langmuir isotherm plots, as previously described (14, 15).
Cell viability assay. Cell viability was determined using a 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, as
previously described (13, 16). Because the doubling time varies from one
cell line to another, B02-GFP, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435s, MCF-7, Hs 578T,
T-47D, and ZR-75-1 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at different cell
densities (5  102, 104, 8  103, 5  102, 6  103, 8  103, and 4  103 cells
per well, respectively) to ensure similar growth rates. Twenty-four hours
later, growing cells were washed and further cultured for 6 d in complete
medium in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of drugs
and in the presence or absence of GGOH (10 Amol/L). The half-maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) of each drug was calculated using a
nonlinear curve fit (Logistic 4PL) with Softmax v2.22 software (Molecular
Devices).
Cytokine array. A commercial antibody-based protein microarray
designed to detect 79 growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines (RayBio
Human Cytokine Array V, RayBiotech) was used. Experiments were carried
out following manufacturer’s instructions. Array membranes were blocked
with the saturated buffer for 1 h and then incubated for 2 h with the
conditioned medium (1 mL) from cultured B02-GFP breast cancer cells or
the supernatant of bone marrow cells collected after flushing the hind limbs
from naive animals and animals with bone metastases that had been
treated or not treated with drugs. After washing, membranes were

incubated for 2 hs with a cocktail of 79 biotinylated antibodies. Membranes
were then washed and incubated for an additional 2 h with a peroxidaselabeled streptavidin solution. Detection of immunoreactive spots was
carried out using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (GE
Healthcare).
Measurement of cytokine production by ELISA. Breast cancer cells
(B02-GFP, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435s, MCF-7, Hs578T, T47D, and ZR-751) were seeded in 24-well and 96-well plates at a cell density used for the cell
viability assay. Growing cells were cultured for 2 d in complete a-MEM in
the presence or absence of drugs. After washing to remove drugs, tumor
cells were further cultured for another 2 d, at which time the 96-well and
24-well plates were used for cell counting and measurement of cytokine
production, respectively. For the measurement of cytokines, cell culture
supernatants containing protease inhibitors (aprotinin and leupeptin;
1 Ag/mL) were centrifuged (1,000  g, 5 min, 4jC) and then stored at
20jC until use. The measurement of human interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, and
MCP-1 was performed by ELISA (Module Set Bender MedSystems, AbCys
SA). Results were expressed as nanograms per milliliter per 106 cells. Cell
culture supernatants used for measurement of cytokine production were
also tested in the osteoclastogenesis assay.
In vitro osteoclastogenesis assay. Experiments were carried out using
8-wk-old female OF1 mice (Charles River Laboratories), as previously
described (16). Briefly, bone marrow cells were flushed from hind limbs and
then seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 180,000 cells per well in
complete a-MEM supplemented with murine macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF, 25 ng/mL; PreproTech), receptor activator of nuclear
receptor factor nB ligand (RANKL; 0.5% v/v) and the conditioned media
from B02-GFP cells previously treated with the vehicle, risedronate, or
NE-10790. After 6 d of culture, differentiated osteoclasts were enumerated
under a light microscope on the basis of multinuclearity (cells with more
than three nuclei) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity
using a commercial kit (Sigma). Results were expressed as the number of
osteoclasts per square centimeter.
Animal studies. All procedures involving animals, including housing and
care, method of euthanasia, and experimental protocols were conducted in
accordance with a code of practice established by the ethical committees in
Lyon (France) and Mason (Ohio). These studies were routinely inspected by
the attending veterinarian to ensure continued compliance with the
proposed protocols. Four-week-old female BALB/c homozygous (nu/nu)
athymic mice and 4-wk-old C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles
River. Sham-operated or ovariectomized 3-mo-old female Sprague-Dawley
rats were obtained from Simonsen Laboratories.
For bone loss experiments, rats were sham-operated or ovariectomized
at 3 mo of age, allowed to lose bone for 7 d, and then treated for 35 d.
During treatment, the vehicle (PBS), risedronate (1.4 Ag/kg body weight), or
NE-10790 (3,700, 12,350 or 37,000 Ag/kg body weight) was given s.c. to
animals daily. Bone mineral density was measured on the proximal tibiae
using single-photon absorptiometry. Results were expressed in milligrams
per square centimeter.
For bone metastasis experiments, we specifically used B02 cells that had
been stably transfected with the gene encoding green fluorescent protein to
detect tumor cells in live animals using noninvasive fluorescence imaging.
The characteristics of the B02-GFP cell line were described elsewhere (17).
B02-GFP cells (5  105 in 100 AL of PBS) were injected into the tail vein of
nude mice anesthetized with 130 mg/kg ketamin and 8.8 mg/kg xylazin.
Based on an average body weight of 20 g for 4-wk-old mice, risedronate
(5–150 Ag/kg body weight) or NE-10790 (20–37,000 Ag/kg body weight) was
given daily to animals by s.c. injection beginning on the day of tumor cell
inoculation (day 0), and continuing until the end of the protocol (day 35).
All doses of each drug were given by s.c. injection in 100 AL PBS (vehicle).
Control mice received a daily treatment with vehicle only. On day 35 after
tumor cell inoculation, radiographs of anesthetized mice were taken with
the use of MIN-R2000 films (Kodak) in an MX-20 cabinet X-ray system
(Faxitron X-Ray Corporation). Osteolytic lesions were identified on radiographs as radiolucent lesions in the bone. The area of the osteolytic lesions
was measured using a Visiolab 2000 computerized image analysis system
(Explora Nova), and the extent of bone destruction per animal was

expressed in square millimeters, as described previously (13, 16, 17).
Animals analyzed by radiography were also examined by noninvasive,
whole-body fluorescence imaging using a fluorescence scanning system
(FluorImager, Molecular Dynamics). Tumor burden in animals was
identified on scanned images as fluorescent spots. The area of fluorescent
spots was measured using an ImageQuant computerized image analysis
system (Molecular Dynamics), and the extent of tumor burden per animal
was expressed in square millimeters, as described previously (16, 17).
Anesthetized mice were killed by cervical dislocation after radiography and
fluorescence imaging on day 35.
Bone histology and histomorphometry. Bone histology and histomorphometric analysis of bone tissue sections were performed as
previously described (13, 16, 17). Briefly, metastatic animals treated with
the vehicle, risedronate, or NE-10790 were killed on day 35 after tumor cell
inoculation, and both hind limbs from each animal were dissected, fixed in
80% (v/v) alcohol, dehydrated, and embedded in methylmethacrylate. A
microtome (Polycut E, Reichert-Jung) was used to cut 7-Am-thick sections
of undecalcified long bones, and the sections were stained with Goldner’s
trichrome (13, 16, 17). Histologic and histomorphometric analyses were
performed on Goldner’s trichrome-stained longitudinal medial sections of
tibial metaphysis with the use of Visiolab 2000 computerized image analysis
system, as described previously (13, 16, 17). The in situ detection of
osteoclasts was performed on TRAP-stained longitudinal medial sections of
tibial metaphysis with the use of a commercial kit (Merck). Osteoclast
number (Oc.N/BS) and resorption surface (Oc.S/BS) were calculated as,
respectively, the ratio of TRAP-positive cells (Oc.N) and TRAP-positive
trabecular bone surface (Oc.S) to the total trabecular bone surface using
Visiolab 2000 computerized image analysis system (16).

Statistical analysis. All data were analyzed with the use of StatView
v5.0 software (version 5.0; SAS Institute, Inc.). Pairwise comparisons were
carried out by performing nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. P values
of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical tests were
two-sided.

Results
Structure-activity relationships of risedronate and NE10790. Phosphonate groups of the P-C-P structure are responsible
for the strong affinity of bisphosphonates for bone mineral (3). NE10790 is a phosphonocarboxylate analogue of risedronate in which
one of the phosphonate groups is replaced with a carboxyl group
(Fig. 1A). The affinity constant (K L) for the adsorption of NE-10790
on hydroxyapatite crystals was measured using an experimental
procedure similar to that previously described for risedronate
(13, 14). Compared with risedronate (K L = 2.2 Amol/L), we observed
that modifications to the P-C-P moiety resulted in a 73-fold
decrease in bone mineral affinity for NE-10790 (K L = 0.03 Amol/L;
ref. 14).
We then studied antiresorptive potencies of risedronate and NE10790 in an animal model of bone loss caused by ovariectomy. The
treatment of ovariectomized animals with increasing doses of NE10790 (3,700–37,000 Ag/kg) showed that the lowest effective dose
(LED) required to prevent bone loss was 12,350 Ag/kg (Fig. 1A). By
contrast, risedronate had a LED of 1.4 Ag/kg (Fig. 1A). NE-10790

was, therefore, 8,800-fold less potent than risedronate as an
inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in vivo.
We next examined the potencies of risedronate and NE-10790 at
inhibiting the viability of B02-GFP breast cancer cells in vitro.
Risedronate reduced the number of viable B02-GFP cells in a timedependent (data not shown) and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B)
with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.37 mmol/L
(Supplementary Table S1). NE-10790 (IC50 = 2.74 mmol/L) was
7-fold less potent than risedronate at reducing tumor cell viability
(Fig. 1B and Supplementary Table S1). These effects of risedronate
and NE-10790 on tumor cell viability were not restricted to B02GFP cells because similar results were obtained with MDA-MB-231,
MDA-MB-435s, MCF-7, Hs578T, T-47D, and ZR-75-1 breast cancer
cell lines (Supplementary Table S1). Risedronate is known for its
ability to inhibit protein prenylation by acting as a potent inhibitor
of FPP synthase (3). NE10790 does not inhibit FPP synthase but,
instead, inhibits Rab geranylgeranyl transferase, an enzyme
downstream of FPP synthase in the mevalonate pathway required

for protein prenylation (11). Cell viability experiments were
therefore conducted in the presence of exogenous geranylgeraniol
(GGOH), an intermediate of the mevalonate pathway downstream
of FPP synthase but upstream of Rab geranylgeranyl transferase.
As shown in Fig. 1C, the inhibitory effect of risedronate on B02GFP cell viability was overcome by replenishing tumor cells with
10 Amol/L GGOH (Fig. 1C). As expected, GGOH did not prevent
the inhibitory effect of NE-10790 (Fig. 1C).
Effects of risedronate and NE-10790 on the formation of
breast cancer bone metastases. We used a mouse model of bone
metastasis in which we have previously shown that the bisphosphonate zoledronate, given s.c. at a daily dose of 150 Ag/kg, markedly
inhibits osteolysis and skeletal tumor burden in animals bearing
B02-GFP breast cancer cells (15). The same dosing regimen was
therefore chosen to compare the effects of risedronate and NE10790 on the formation of B02-GFP breast cancer bone metastases.
Radiographical analysis on day 35 after tumor cell injection
revealed that metastatic animals treated with risedronate had

cancer cells were treated daily with 150 Ag/kg risedronate or NE-10790, beginning on the day of tumor cell inoculation (day 0) and continuing until the end of the
protocol (day 35). Control mice received a daily treatment with the vehicle only. Naive mice were animals that had not been inoculated with tumor cells. A, radiographs

*Drug administration was initiated from the time of tumor cell inoculation (day 0) to the end of the protocol (day 35). All measurements were made 35 d
after tumor cell injection. Results are the mean F SE of three separate experiments. Risedronate and NE-10790 were given at a daily dose of 150 Ag/kg
s.c. from days 0 to 35. PBS was used as vehicle. Naive are age-matched animals that had not been injected with tumor cells.

osteolytic lesions that were 95% smaller than those of tumorbearing mice treated with the vehicle (Fig. 2A; Table 1). By contrast,
NE-10790 did not inhibit bone destruction (Fig. 2A; Table 1).
Noninvasive fluorescence imaging on day 35 after tumor cell
injection showed that these metastatic animals treated with
risedronate or NE-10790 also had a statistically significantly lower
tumor burden than animals treated with the vehicle (Fig. 2B). In
this respect, risedronate and NE-10790 decreased tumor burden by
40% and 70%, respectively, compared with vehicle (Table 1).
Histomorphometric analysis of hind limbs with metastases
showed that mice treated with risedronate had a bone volume
(BV)–tissue volume (TV) ratio that was significantly higher than
vehicle-treated mice and mice that had not been injected with
tumor cells, indicating a complete prevention of bone loss by the
bisphosphonate (Fig. 2C; Table 1). TRAP staining of bone tissue
sections of metastatic legs from mice treated with risedronate
showed a statistically significant inhibition of the osteoclast
number (Oc.N) and active-osteoclast resorption surface (Oc.S) per
trabecular bone surface (BS) when compared with vehicle (Fig. 3).
By contrast, the BV/TV, Oc.N/BS, and Oc.S/BS ratios for mice
treated with NE-10790 did not statistically significantly differ from
those observed with vehicle-treated mice (Table 1; Figs. 2C and 3).
Yet, mice treated with NE-10790 had a tumor burden (TB)–soft
tissue volume (STV) ratio decreased by 75% compared with vehicle
(Table 1). Risedronate also reduced the TB/STV ratio by 80%,
compared with vehicle (Table 1).
Aside from our observation that these compounds decreased
skeletal B02-GFP tumor burden at a dosage of 150 Ag/kg/d (Fig. 2B
and C; Table 1), we found that the same dosing regimen of NE10790 or risedronate did not inhibit the growth of s.c. B02-GFP
tumor xenografts in animals (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Moreover,
risedronate and NE-10790 (used at a dosage of 350 Ag/kg/d) did not
inhibit the formation of B16-F10 pulmonary metastases in animals
(Supplementary Fig. S1B).
A head-to-head comparison of the effects of risedronate and
NE-10790 on bone metastasis formation was next conducted using
increasing doses of each of these compounds. Radiographical
analysis and fluorescence imaging of animals on day 35 after B02GFP tumor cell injection revealed that risedronate and NE-10790

www.aacrjournals.org

inhibited both osteolysis and tumor burden in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 3). The LED of risedronate that inhibited osteolysis
(15 Ag/kg/d) did not inhibit tumor burden (Fig. 3A and B),
indicating that risedronate first inhibited osteoclast-mediated bone
resorption and then skeletal tumor growth. Conversely, the LED of
NE-10790 that inhibited tumor burden (150 Ag/kg/d) did not
inhibit osteolysis (Figs. 2 and 3A and B). A higher dose of NE-10790
(37,000 Ag/kg/d) did, however, inhibit osteolysis, as judged by
radiography and TRAP staining of metastatic bone tissue sections
(Fig. 3).
Effects of risedronate and NE-10790 on the production of
osteoclast-stimulatory cytokines by breast cancer cells. In vitro
B02-GFP cells produced several cytokines, chemokines, and growth
factors as detected by RayBio human cytokine antibody arrays
(Gro, GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, IGFBP-1, VEGF, TIMP-1, and
TIMP-2; Fig. 4A). The effects of risedronate and NE-10790 on
production of these factors were investigated. B02-GFP cells were
cultured for 2 days in the presence of risedronate or NE-10790
using a concentration that induced a 50% reduction in cell viability.
After washing to remove drugs, tumor cells were further cultured
for another 2 days, at which time conditioned media were collected
and incubated with a cytokine antibody array membrane.
Compared with vehicle, several cytokines were differentially
expressed in the conditioned medium from cells treated with
risedronate or NE-10790, including osteoclast-stimulatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 (Supplementary Fig. S2). These results
were confirmed by ELISA. NE-10790 and, to a lower extent,
risedronate stimulated the production of IL-8, IL-6, and MCP-1 by
B02-GFP cells when compared with that observed with the
conditioned medium from vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 4B).
Ex vivo experiments, using human cytokine antibody arrays and
ELISA, were next conducted to measure human cytokine levels in
the bone marrow of metastatic hind limbs from animals treated
with a daily dose of 150 Ag/kg risedronate, NE-10790, or the vehicle.
Several human cytokines/growth factors were produced in the bone
marrow of metastatic legs from vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 4C),
among which human IL-8 was the most abundant. No human IL-8
was detected in the bone marrow cell supernatant of bones from
age-matched animals that had not been inoculated with B02-GFP

cells (naive animals; Fig. 4D), further indicating that the detection
of human IL-8 was solely inherent to the presence of human tumor
cells in the bone marrow. Furthermore, human IL-8 amounts in
bone marrow cell supernatants of metastatic bones from
risedronate-treated and NE-10790–treated animals were increased
2-fold to 3-fold compared with vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 4D).
After the observation that risedronate and NE-10790 stimulated
the production of osteoclast-stimulatory cytokines by tumor cells,
conditioned media used to measure human cytokine levels were
tested for their ability to stimulate osteoclastogenesis in vitro.
These conditioned media did not, however, induce the development of mature osteoclasts in vitro (Fig. 5). Additional experiments
were therefore conducted in the presence of RANKL and
M-CSF, which are two hematopoietic factors both necessary and
sufficient to induce osteoclastogenesis (18). Compared with the
conditioned medium from vehicle-treated tumor cells, the
conditioned medium collected from NE-10790–treated B02-GFP
cells statistically significantly enhanced the differentiation of
osteoclasts induced by RANKL + M-CSF (Fig. 5). By contrast, the
conditioned medium from risedronate-treated cells did not
promote RANKL + M-CSF-induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro
(Fig. 5).
Effect of a combined treatment with risedronate and NE10790 on breast cancer bone metastases. Results obtained with
risedronate and NE-10790 on breast cancer bone metastasis

formation brought us to the question of whether risedronate
might maximize the antitumor activity of NE-10790 when used in
combination. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S3, the combination
of risedronate (used at its lowest antiresorptive effective dose) with
NE-10790 (used at its lowest antitumor effective dose) statistically
significantly decreased both osteolysis and skeletal tumor burden
when compared with the vehicle-treated animals, whereas risedronate or NE-10790 alone at these doses only decreased either
osteolysis or tumor burden, respectively. The use of NE-10790 in
combination with risedronate did not further decrease the extent
of osteolytic lesions when compared with risedronate alone (1.4 F
0.4 versus 1.9 F 1.3 mm2, respectively; Supplementary Fig. S3A).
Similarly, the antitumor efficacy observed in combining NE-10790
with risedronate did not differ statistically significantly from that
obtained with NE-10790 alone (3.7 F 1.4 versus 4.1 F 1.3 mm2,
respectively; Supplementary Fig. S3B).

Discussion
Our results first show that the bisphosphonate risedronate given
at a low dosage in an animal model of breast cancer bone
metastasis inhibited osteolysis by inhibiting bone resorption,
whereas therapy with higher dosages also inhibited skeletal tumor
burden. These results are in agreement with previous preclinical
findings (19), showing that zoledronate therapy with a long dosing

interval inhibits osteolysis, whereas a therapy with more frequent
dosing intervals reduces both osteolysis and skeletal tumor burden.
It is possible that the antitumor activity of bisphosphonates (as
exemplified here by risedronate) in preclinical models of bone
metastasis is explained by the inhibition of osteoclast-mediated
bone resorption which, in turn, deprives tumor cells of bonederived growth factors that are required for tumor growth.
However, if a bisphosphonate treatment decreased skeletal tumor
burden solely by reducing bone loss, we would have expected the
lower dosage of risedronate to have inhibited skeletal tumor
growth more than what we observed. Similarly, zoledronate
therapy with a long dosing interval would have also inhibited
skeletal tumor burden (19). Thus, there must be additional reasons
explaining the limited antitumor activity of these drugs in vivo. We
have previously shown that mineral-bound bisphosphonates are
significantly less potent than soluble bisphosphonates at inhibiting
breast and prostate cancer cell adhesion to bone in vitro (6). We
therefore surmised that, irrespective of the antiresorptive properties of bisphosphonates, the rapid uptake of these drugs in bone
might limit their ability to act directly on tumor cells that reside in
the bone marrow. Conversely, bisphosphonates with a low bone

www.aacrjournals.org

mineral affinity should be more readily released from the bone
surface, enabling a more prolonged exposure of the bone marrow
to these drugs and a direct effect on tumor cells. To address this
important question, we examined the effects of NE-10790 on
osteolysis and skeletal tumor growth.
Our results show that, compared with risedronate, NE-10790
poorly inhibited osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in animal
models of bone loss caused by ovariectomy or cancer. These results
were in complete agreement with a previous report showing that
NE-10790 is 8,000-fold less potent than risedronate at inhibiting
bone resorption in the Schenk rat growing model (8). Conversely,
NE-10790 is only 100-fold less potent than risedronate at inhibiting
osteoclastic resorption in vitro (9, 12). The difference in
antiresorptive potency between in vitro and in vivo studies is
likely explained by the low bone mineral affinity of NE-10790 which,
in turn, limits the skeletal uptake of the drug in vivo. Our results
also show that a continuous treatment with NE-10790, at a dosage
that did not inhibit osteolysis, produced meaningful antitumor
effects in a mouse model of breast cancer bone metastasis.
Moreover, the in vivo antitumor activity of NE-10790 was restricted
to bone because the dosing regimen of NE-10790 that reduced

Figure 5. Effect of the conditioned medium from B02 breast cancer cells treated
with a drug (risedronate or NE-10790) or the vehicle on osteoclast differentiation.
Mononuclear cells were isolated from the bone marrow, and then incubated
with or without RANKL + M-CSF and the conditioned medium (diluted 1:5 in
complete medium) from B02-GFP cells trated with the vehicle, risedronate
(IC50, 0.37 mmol/L), or NE-10790 (IC50, 2.7 mmol/L). Osteoclasts were observed
in the presence of RANK-L and M-CSF only. Differentiated osteoclasts were
enumerated under a light microscope as a function of multinucleation (more than
three nuclei) and TRAP staining. Representative TRAP-stained osteoclasts
are shown for each treatment, and the osteoclast number (cell/cm2) is indicated
in blue. Results are the mean F SD of three separate experiments. The
number of osteoclasts in the NE-10790–treated group is statistically significantly
higher than the vehicle-treated or risedronate-treated group (P < 0.01,
Mann-Whitney U test).

skeletal B02-GFP tumor burden did not inhibit the s.c. growth of
B02-GFP tumor xenografts nor the formation of B16-F10 melanoma lung metastases. Thus, our results strongly suggest that, after a
transient accumulation in bone, NE-10790 was released from bone
mineral, enabling a direct effect of the drug on breast cancer cells
that reside in the bone marrow.
How did NE-10790 inhibit skeletal tumor burden in our mouse
model of bone metastasis? NE-10790 specifically inhibits Rab
geranylgeranyl transferase (Rab GGTase or GGTase-2) in several cell
types, including osteoclasts, macrophages, and myeloma cells
(11, 12). In addition, NE-10790 induces apoptosis of myeloma cells
(11) and inhibits breast cancer cell invasion in vitro (10). We found
that NE-10790 also inhibited the viability of breast cancer cell lines
and that GGOH (an intermediate of the mevalonate pathway
upstream of Rab GGTase) did not prevent the inhibitory effect of
NE-10790 on viability of breast cancer cells. Moreover, NE-10790
inhibited the prenylation of Rab6 (geranylgeranylated by Rab
GGTase) but not that of Rap1a (geranylgeranylated by GGTase-1) in
B02-GFP breast cancer cells.5 These results are in line with the

observation that NE-10790 disrupts the prenylation and membrane
localization of several Rab proteins (Rab5, Rab6, and Rab27a) in
J774 macrophages (20). Evidence is emerging that Rab GGTase
plays an important role in cancer cell proliferation and aggressiveness in vivo (21, 22). Our results provide some support for a role
of prenylated Rab GGTase in breast cancer bone metastasis. They
also suggest that NE-10790 (and potentially to some extent,
risedronate and other bisphosphonates, depending on their bone
mineral affinity), by preventing Rab prenylation in breast cancer
cells, reduced both the invasion and viability of tumor cells, leading
to inhibition of skeletal tumor burden.
Whereas NE-10790 was decreasing skeletal tumor growth, it
concomitantly stimulated the production of osteoclast-stimulatory
cytokine IL-8 by tumor cells resident in the bone marrow. Tumorderived IL-8 mediates osteolysis in experimental breast cancer
bone metastasis (23). These findings (23) may explain why tumorbearing animals treated with NE-10790 had osteolytic lesions
despite a substantial reduction of skeletal tumor burden.
Molecular mechanisms through which NE-10790 stimulates IL-8
production by breast cancer cells are unknown. Cyclooxygenase-2
(COX-2) overexpression in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells causes
an increase production of IL-8 (24). GGTI-286, a selective inhibitor
of geranylgeranyltransferases, increases COX-2 expression in
smooth muscle cells (25). It is therefore possible that NE-10790
stimulates COX-2 expression in breast cancer cells. Whatever the
molecular mechanisms are, a higher dosage of NE-10790 inhibited
osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, thereby counteracting the
osteoclast-stimulatory effect of tumor-derived IL-8. The risk
associated with IL-8 production by NE-10790–treated tumor cells
was also minimized when using NE-10790 in combination with
risedronate. Moreover, the combination of NE-10790 with risedronate inhibited both osteolysis and skeletal tumor burden,
whereas NE-10790 or risedronate used as a single-agent therapy
only decreased either tumor burden or osteolysis, respectively. Our
results are reminiscent of those obtained in combining bisphosphonates with chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of
animals with bone metastases, in which drug combinations were
shown to provide a greater benefit compared with either drug
alone (4, 26). These experimental findings (refs. 4, 26 and this study)
are therefore in line with current clinical studies investigating the
utility of bisphosphonates as adjuvant therapy for the prevention of
bone metastases in several large-scale clinical trials in multiple
cancer types (27). For example, it was recently reported that
the addition of zoledronate to adjuvant endocrine therapy for
premenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast cancer
significantly prolonged the disease-free and relapse-free survival by
35% over a 5-year period (28). Our results suggest that the use of
risedronate and NE-10790 in combination with standard cytotoxic
and/or endocrine treatments may represent another promising
approach to obtain clinically meaningful antitumor effects.
In conclusion, our study shows for the first time that decreasing
the bone mineral affinity of bisphosphonates is an effective therapeutic strategy to inhibit skeletal tumor growth in a mouse model of
breast cancer bone metastasis. We believe that such compounds
with a low bone mineral affinity will open new exciting ways for
optimizing antitumor activity of bisphosphonates in oncology.
