BACKGROUND: Eribulin mesylate is a tubulin inhibitor with activity superior to paclitaxel in NIH:OVCAR-3 human epithelial ovarian cancer xenograft models. In this study, the authors assessed the efficacy of eribulin in platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. METHODS: Patients with recurrent, measurable epithelial ovarian
cancer who had received 2 prior cytotoxic regimens and who had adequate organ function were enrolled into 2
separate cohorts: 1) platinum-resistant patients (who had a progression-free interval <6 months after their last platinum-based therapy) and 2) platinum-sensitive patients (who had a progression-free interval 6 months after their
last platinum-based therapy). Eribulin 1.4 mg/m2 was administered over 15 minutes intravenously on days 1 and 8 every 21 days. Efficacy was determined by objective response on computed tomography studies. RESULTS: In the platinum-resistant cohort, 37 patients enrolled, and 36 patients were evaluable for response and toxicity. Two patients
achieved a partial response (5.5%), and 16 patients (44%) had stable disease as their best response. The median progression-free survival was 1.8 months (95% confidence interval, 1.4-2.8 months). In the platinum-sensitive cohort, 37
patients enrolled, and all were evaluable for response. Seven patients achieved a partial response (19%). The median
progression-free survival was 4.1 months (95% confidence interval, 2.8-5.8 months). The major toxicity was grade 3 or
4 neutropenia (42% of platinum-resistant patients; 54% of platinum-sensitive patients). CONCLUSIONS: Eribulin produced an objective response in 5.5% of women with platinum-resistant, recurrent ovarian cancer and in 19% of
women with platinum-sensitive disease. The median progression-free survival was 1.8 months in the platinum-resistant

INTRODUCTION
In 2010, epithelial ovarian cancer was diagnosed in approximately 21,880 women in the United States, and approximately 13,850 American women died from this disease.1 Nearly 75% of women with epithelial ovarian cancer have stage
III or IV disease at the time of diagnosis. Although >80% of patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer will demonstrate
a clinical response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, the majority ultimately will die of their disease, and the
5-year overall survival rate ranges from 5% to 30%.2,3
For patients who have disease progression on first-line therapy (primary refractory disease) and patients whose disease progresses within the first 6 to 12 months after completing first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, the efficacy of
further chemotherapy is poor. Although several agents with some evidence of activity have been identified in phase 2 trials,
responses (generally partial responses at best) are observed in approximately 15% to 30% of women (depending on the
platinum sensitivity of the population). Responses in platinum-resistant patients are observed in only approximately 15%
of patients, and the duration of response is only approximately 4 months.

Original Article

Eribulin mesylate (E7389; halichondrin B) is a tubulin inhibitor whose mechanism of action differs from that
of other antitubulin agents, effecting cell cycle block at G2/
M, disruption of mitotic spindle formation, and initiation
of apoptosis.4 Eribulin mesylate appears to have a tubulin
interaction mechanism that differs from that of paclitaxel.
In in vivo studies using NIH:OVCAR-3 human ovarian
cancer xenograft models, treatment with eribulin mesylate
increased survival and reduced the size and number of metastases, with activity superior to that of paclitaxel.4,5
There is a clinical need for new, effective agents for
the treatment of ovarian cancer, particularly for patients
who have received prior taxane-platinum-based chemotherapy. Because the response rates to second-line treatment are generally higher among patients with platinumsensitive disease, we designed this study to determine
whether eribulin mesylate could achieve objective
responses among patients with recurrent ovarian cancer
who were studied in 2 separate cohorts: platinum-resistant
patients and platinum-sensitive patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
Eligible patients were aged 18 years and had histologically or cytologically confirmed epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer; measurable
disease (defined according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST], version 1.0); no more
than 2 prior therapies for this cancer; and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
of 0-1. Prior surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation
must have been completed at least 4 weeks before enrollment (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C), and
patients must have recovered from any prior treatmentrelated adverse events. Patients were required to have
adequate bone marrow function (white blood cell count
[WBC] 3000/lL, absolute neutrophil count [ANC]
1500/lL, and platelets 100,000/lL), renal function
(creatinine within normal institutional limits), and hepatic function (total bilirubin within normal institutional
limits, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels 2.5 times the institutional
upper limit of normal). Eligible patients had to have a life
expectancy >2 months and the ability to understand and
willingness to sign a written informed consent form.
Patients were not permitted to take concomitant antitumor hormone therapy and/or investigational agents, and
they must have discontinued any prior hormone therapy

2404

at least 14 days before starting study treatment. Patients
who had had another invasive malignancy within the past
5 years were excluded, except for patients with a history of
stage IA or IB endometrial cancer (who were considered
disease free from endometrial cancer) and patients with a
history of nonmelanoma skin cancer. Other exclusions
included patients with known brain metastases; patients
who were pregnant or breastfeeding; patients with known
human immunodeficiency virus; and patients with
uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that
would limit compliance with study requirements. Patients
who previously received eribulin or patients who had a
history of allergic reaction to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition of eribulin were ineligible.
An effort was made to switch patients who were taking
enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant agents and any other
medications/substances known to affect (or with the
potential to affect) the pharmacokinetics of eribulin to
other medications before starting study treatment.
Patients were assigned to the platinum-resistant cohort if
the progression-free interval from last platinum-based
therapy was <6 months, and they were assigned to the
platinum-sensitive cohort if the progression-free interval
from last platinum-based therapy was 6 months. All
patients signed written informed consent forms. The protocol was reviewed annually by the institutional review
boards/privacy boards of the participating institutions.
Treatment
Eribulin mesylate 1.4 mg/m2 was administered intravenously over 15 minutes on days 1 and 8 every 21 days (to
accommodate scheduling difficulties, all day-1 treatments
could be given 1 day early or up to 2 days late, provided
all treatment parameters were met). On day 1 of each
cycle, an ANC 1000/lL and platelets 100,000/lL
were required. On day 8 of each cycle, eribulin was held if
the ANC was <500/lL or if the platelets were <50,000/
lL. If the day-8 eribulin was held for myelosuppression,
then the dose was not ‘‘made up.’’ Day 1 treatment delays
were permitted for up to 2 weeks for recovery of the ANC
to 1000/lL and of platelets to 100,000/lL. The use
of granulocyte-colony–stimulating factors (GCSFs) was
not allowed during Cycle 1 of treatment, and prophylactic
or routine use during subsequent cycles was not recommended. In the case of neutropenia without fever or febrile neutropenia, administration of GCSFs according to

Cancer

current American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, was allowed. If GCSFs were used in subsequent
cycles, then a 24-hour window before and after treatment
with eribulin was recommended. The use of GCSFs
between days 1 and 8 of treatment was not recommended.
Dose reduction of eribulin to 1 mg/m2 for all subsequent
cycles was required in the event of febrile neutropenia; a
platelet count <10,000/lL; grade 4 neutropenia that
lasted 7 days; grade 3 or 4 elevations in ALT, AST, or
alkaline phosphatase; grade 3 or 4 stomatitis; or grade 2 or
worse renal toxicity. Eribulin-related toxicities had to
resolve to within eligibility parameters (within 2 weeks)
before the next cycle could be given. Treatment with eribulin was continued for as long as there was no evidence
of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, an intercurrent illness that prevented further treatment, patient withdrawal of consent from study, or any change in the
patient’s condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,
rendered the patient unable to continue safely on study.
Monitoring for Toxicity and Assessment of
Response
All patients had the following evaluations: physical examination, vital signs, assessment of performance status,
weekly complete blood counts and serum chemistries, serum CA 125 on day 1 of each cycle, and ongoing assessment of adverse events and concurrent medications. For
evaluation of response, all patients had computed tomography scans of chest/abdomen/pelvis every other cycle.
Radiographic response was determined according to
RECIST (version 1.0),6 with the following definitions: a
complete response (CR) was defined as the disappearance
of all target lesions; a partial response (PR) was defined as
a decrease 30% in the sum of the greatest dimension of
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of the
greatest dimension; progressive disease (PD) was defined
as an increase 20% in the sum of the greatest dimension
of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of
the greatest dimension recorded since treatment started or
the appearance of 1 or more new lesions; and stable disease (SD) was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to
qualify for a PR nor a sufficient increase to qualify as PD,
taking as reference the smallest sum of the greatest dimension since treatment started. Patients were considered to
be evaluable by CA 125 if the CA 125 level was >35 U/mL
before the start of study treatment. Patients were considered
to have had a CA 125 response if there had been a serial
decrease in CA 125 of at least 50% over 4 samples or a serial
decrease of at least 75% over 3 samples.7,8

Statistical Considerations
The primary endpoint of the study was to determine the
frequency of objective response to treatment with eribulin
in patients with recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer. The study was designed to assess the objective response rate (CR þ PR) separately for the following
2 cohorts: 1) patients with platinum-resistant disease
(progression-free interval from last platinum-based therapy <6 months) and 2) patients with potentially platinum-sensitive disease (progression-free interval from last
platinum-based therapy 6 months). The 2 cohorts were
accrued and analyzed separately. Within each cohort, an
optimal 2-stage Simon design was used in which a 20%
response rate was considered promising, and a 5%
response rate was considered unacceptable.9 With both
type I error and type II error set at 10%, 12 patients were
to be enrolled initially and treated with eribulin, and
enrollment was to be expanded to 37 patients if at least
1 patient had an objective response (CR or PR) in each
cohort.
The treatment regimen was considered to have demonstrated a promising level of single-agent activity in the
respective cohort if at least 4 of 37 patients had objective
responses. Within each cohort, this design yields at least a
90% probability of a positive result if the true response
rate is 20%, and it yields a 90% probability of a negative
result if the true response rate is 5%. Platinum-sensitive
patients and platinum-resistant patients were analyzed
separately. Descriptive statistics were provided on patient
characteristics, toxicities, and responses. Objective
response rates were calculated for each cohort. In addition, the response rate and its 1-sided 90% confidence
interval (CI) were estimated using an exact inference
method that appropriately accounted for the 2-stage
design feature.10 The Kaplan-Meier method11 was used
to estimate the progression-free survival. Analyses were
performed using the R statistical software package ‘‘Clinfun’’ (R Project for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and SAS software (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC).12 Although it was not designated as a study
endpoint, in response to reviewers, the ‘‘disease control
rate,’’ defined as the percentage of patients achieving CR,
or PR, or SD, and its 90% CI were calculated for each
cohort.

outcomes are detailed below for each cohort.
Platinum-Resistant Cohort
Thirty-seven patients were accrued to the platinum-resistant cohort, and 36 were evaluable for response and toxicity (1 patient was removed from study before initiating
study treatment because of declining performance status).
All patients had received platinum-taxane first-line treatment (carboplatin or cisplatin plus paclitaxel in 34
patients, docetaxel in 2 patients) and had a median platinum-free interval of 3 months (range, 0.1-5.9 months).
Thirty patients had received second-line treatment:

2406

5 were retreated with paclitaxel plus carboplatin, 10
received gemcitabine plus carboplatin, 10 received liposomal doxorubicin, 2 received carboplatin plus pemetrexed,
1 received carboplatin plus liposomal doxorubicin, 1
received single-agent carboplatin, and 1 received topotecan. In addition, 2 patients had received maintenance
paclitaxel after achieving complete clinical remission with
first-line treatment. The median age was 61 years (range,
38-80 years), and the median ECOG performance status
was 0. Among the 36 evaluable patients, the median number of cycles delivered per patient was 2 (range, 1-10
cycles). Two patients achieved a PR (5.5%). Calculating
the response rate using a bias-correcting estimate yields an

was only 1.8 months (95% CI, 1.4-2.8 months). The median overall survival among platinum-resistant patients
was 18 months (95% CI, 11-25 months) (Fig. 1). On a
per-patient basis, grade 3 or 4 adverse events that were at
least possibly treatment-related included neutropenia in
42% of patients, leucopenia in 33% of patients, anemia in
2.7% of patients, lymphopenia in 2.7% of patients, febrile
neutropenia in 2.7% of patients, infection in 5.5% of
patients, thrombosis in 5.5% of patients, hypokalemia in
5.5% of patients, hyperglycemia in 2.7% of patients, and
generalized muscle weakness in 2.7% of patients.
Platinum-Sensitive Cohort
Thirty-seven patients were accrued to the platinum-sensitive cohort, and all were evaluable for response. The median platinum-free interval was 10 months (range, 6.5-45
months). All patients had received platinum (carboplatin
or cisplatin) plus taxane-based first-line treatment (36
received paclitaxel, and 1 received docetaxel). Sixteen
patients had received second-line therapy: 6 patients were
retreated with paclitaxel plus carboplatin, 6 patients
received gemcitabine plus carboplatin, 1 received oxaliplatin plus gemcitabine, 1 received carboplatin plus pemetrexed, 1 received liposomal doxorubicin, and 1 received
bevacizumab. In addition, 2 patients in the platinum-sensitive cohort had received maintenance paclitaxel after
achieving first complete clinical remission. The median
age of the patients in the platinum-sensitive cohort was 60
years (range, 45-77 years), and the median ECOG performance status was 0. The median number of cycles
delivered was 6 per patient (range, 1-51 cycles per
patient). Seven of 37 evaluable patients achieved an objective response (PR; 19%), and no patients achieved a CR.
Calculating the response rate using a bias-correcting estimate yielded an objective response rate of 19.8%, and the

2408

lower bound of the 1-sided 90% CI was 11%. Twentyone patients had SD as their best response (57%). Thirtyone patients had serum CA 125 values that were evaluable, and 11 patients (35%) had CA 125 responses. The
‘‘disease control rate’’ (CR þ PR þ SD) was 28 of 37
patients (76%; 90% CI, 61%-100%). Response durations
for the 7 patients who achieved objective responses are
listed in Table 3. The median progression-free survival
was 4.1 months (95% CI, 2.8-5.8 months), and the median overall survival among platinum-sensitive patients
was 26 months (95% CI, 21-38 months) (Fig. 2). On a
per-patient basis, grade 3 or 4 adverse events that were at
least possibly treatment-related included neutropenia in
54% of patients, leucopenia in 30% of patients, lymphopenia in 5.4% of patients, pain in 8% of patients, generalized muscle weakness in 5.4% of patients, elevated liver
enzymes in 5.4% of patients, thrombosis in 2.7% of
patients, hyperglycemia in 2.7% of patients, hyponatremia in 2.7% of patients, hypophosphatemia in 2.7% of
patients, hypomagnesemia in 2.7% of patients, diarrhea
in 2.7% of patients, and ataxia in 2.7% of patients.

DISCUSSION
This study was designed for 2 separate cohorts of patients
with recurrent ovarian cancer to determine the activity of
eribulin in platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive
patients. Objective responses were observed in only 5.5%
of platinum-resistant patients; in contrast, 19% of platinum-sensitive patients achieved objective responses. A
similar contrast in sensitivity to nonplatinum chemotherapy agents has been reported with most other agents tested
in ovarian cancer. In a large phase 3 trial, liposomal doxorubicin was compared with topotecan among patients who
were stratified as platinum resistant or platinum sensitive
before randomization. Objective response rates did not
differ substantially between the 2 drugs, but they were
higher in the platinum-sensitive patients (liposomal doxorubicin, 28%; topotecan, 28%) than in the platinum-resistant patients (liposomal doxorubicin, 12.3%;
topotecan, 6.5%).13 In a phase 3 trial comparing gemcitabine with liposomal doxorubicin in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, objective responses were
observed in 9.2% of patients assigned to gemcitabine and
in 11.7% of patients assigned to liposomal doxorubicin.14
In a single-arm phase 2 trial of liposomal doxorubicin in
platinum-resistant patients, 9.9% of patients had objective responses15; however, an earlier trial reported an 18%
response rate in a platinum-resistant and taxane-resistant

population.16 Although the observed response rate of
19% among patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer makes eribulin a promising new agent for this population, effective treatment for platinum-resistant ovarian
cancer remains a significant therapeutic challenge.

The treatment schedule of eribulin is convenient,
with a short infusion time and no required steroid premedications. Neutropenia was the most common toxicity,
although neutropenic fever events were rare (2.7% of
patients in the platinum-resistant cohort and no events in

the platinum-sensitive cohort). Patients in this study had
received only 1 or 2 prior regimens. Subsequent to the
design and conduct of this study for patients with ovarian
cancer, eribulin was approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer based on results from a randomized phase 3 trial.17
Prolonged neutropenia and neuropathy both were more
common in the breast cancer studies18 than they were in
this ovarian cancer study, perhaps because patients in the
breast cancer studies were much more heavily pretreated.
It is noteworthy that, in the breast cancer studies,
eribulin achieved high objective response rates although
most patients had received prior taxane therapy. We
observed a similar result in our study: All patients enrolled
had received prior platinum, and all had received prior
taxane, yet objective responses were observed despite prior
taxane therapy.
There has been increasing focus on progression-free
survival, rather than the objective response rate, as a measure
of drug efficacy, particularly for clinical trials involving targeted therapeutic agents.19 In this 2-cohort phase 2 study,
progression-free survival was a secondary objective. Among
patients in the platinum-resistant cohort, progression-free
survival did not appear to be prolonged by treatment with
eribulin (median progression-free survival, 1.8 months). In
the platinum-sensitive cohort, progression-free survival was
4.1 months, which is similar to what has been observed with
other agents with activity in platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. Some studies have used the ‘‘disease control rate’’ as a
measure of treatment efficacy. Although the current study
was not designed with the disease control rate as an endpoint, in response to article reviewers, we have reported
these results. The disease control rate in the platinum-sensitive cohort is high (76%), which mirrors the relatively high
objective response rate. Although the observed disease control rate in the platinum-resistant cohort appears favorable
(50%), the wide CI and the very short progression-free survival of 1.8 months support the conclusion that eribulin is
not active in the platinum-resistant population.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate the efficacy of eribulin in recurrent ovarian cancer.
We demonstrate that eribulin is a novel and active agent
for patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent disease and
that eribulin is inactive in platinum-resistant disease.
