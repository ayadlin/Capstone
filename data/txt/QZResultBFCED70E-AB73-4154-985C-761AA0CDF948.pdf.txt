BACKGROUND: The objective of the current study was to follow up the results of phase 1 testing by evaluating the clinical efficacy of
the green tea extract Polyphenon E for patients with early stage chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). METHODS: Previously
untreated patients with asymptomatic, Rai stage 0 to II CLL and an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC)  10  109/L were eligible for
this phase 2 trial. Polyphenon E with a standardized dose of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (2000 mg per dose) was administered
twice daily. RESULTS: A total of 42 patients received Polyphenon E at a dose of 2000 mg twice daily for up to 6 months. Of these
patients, 29 (69%) had Rai stage I to II disease. Patients received a median of 6 cycles of treatment (range, 1 cycle-6 cycles). The
most common grade 3 side effects (according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) were
transaminitis (1 patient), abdominal pain (1 patient), and fatigue (1 patient). Clinical activity was observed, with 13 patients (31%) experiencing a sustained reduction of  20% in the ALC and 20 of 29 patients (69%) with palpable adenopathy experiencing at least a
50% reduction in the sum of the products of all lymph node areas. EGCG plasma levels after 1 month of therapy were found to be correlated with reductions in lymphadenopathy (correlation co-efficient, 0.44; P ¼ .02). Overall, 29 patients (69%) fulfilled the criteria for
a biologic response with either a sustained decline  20% in the ALC and/or a reduction  30% in the sum of the products of all
lymph node areas at some point during the 6 months of active treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Daily oral EGCG in the Polyphenon E preparation was well tolerated by patients with CLL in this phase 2 trial. Durable declines in the ALC and/or lymphadenopathy were

INTRODUCTION
Green tea has long been proposed as a health-promoting substance that reduces the risk of cancer.1,2 After 3 case-control
studies demonstrated that green tea intake was associated with a reduced risk of leukemia3,4 and non-Hodgkin
lymphoma,5 a population-based cohort study of approximately 42,000 individuals prospectively followed for 9 years was
conducted.6 Green tea consumption was inversely associated with the risk of lymphoid malignancies even after adjusting
for 16 other personal characteristics including age, sex, smoking history, level of education, occupation, consumption of
other dietary products, and family history of leukemia.6
Tea polyphenols (catechins) exert multitargeted effects on malignant cells.7-10 Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the
major catechin in tea, induces apoptotic cell death in animal models of human non-Hodgkin lymphoma,11 B-cell lymphoma cell lines,12,13 and primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells.14 Subsequent case reports in patients
with low-grade B-cell malignancies suggested these preclinical findings may have clinical relevance.15
Based on this series of observations and the favorable toxicity profile of green tea extracts reported in human testing,16,17 we conducted a phase 1/2 trial of daily, oral Polyphenon E (a standardized, pharmaceutical-grade catechin preparation) for patients with asymptomatic, Rai stage 0 to II CLL.18 As previously reported, daily oral EGCG was well
tolerated at the maximum dose tested (2000 mg twice per day) in the phase 1 component of the trial and declines in the
absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and/or lymphadenopathy were observed in the majority of the 36 patients treated.18
Coincident with our CLL trial, a randomized, placebo control trial of green tea catechins in patients with high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia found that tea catechins reduced the risk of progression to prostate cancer (progression to

and 11%, respectively; placebo, 30% and 53%, respectively; P < .01).19,20 Similar studies have also suggested
EGCG may result in a clinical benefit in patients with
high-risk premalignant oral lesions.21 These studies
extend the extensive preclinical evidence and suggest that
green tea catechins may have clinical benefits in patients
with premalignant and indolent malignant conditions. In
the current study, we report the results of the phase 2
component of the CLL trial exploring the clinical benefits
of Polyphenon E.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility

We instituted a phase 1/2 trial of Polyphenon E in
patients with previously untreated asymptomatic, Rai
stage 0 to II CLL who did not meet National Cancer Institute Working Group(NCI-WG)22 criteria to initiate
chemotherapy. Patients were required to have a confirmed
diagnosis of CLL by standard criteria.22 Mantle cell lymphoma was excluded in all patients by fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) assessing for a t(11;14). The eligibility criteria for the phase 2 portion of the trial were identical to those reported for the phase 1 portion of the study18
with 2 exceptions. First, although patients who had used
over-the-counter green tea or green tea extracts with medicinal intent were eligible for the phase 1 portion of the
trial provided they had not used such medications within
8 weeks of registration; such individuals were excluded
from the phase 2 portion of the trial so that it better
reflected the experience of patients who had not been previously treated with green tea extracts. Second, the phase 1
portion of the trial required patients have an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of at least 5  109/L whereas the
phase 2 portion of the trial required patients have an ALC
of at least 10  109/L to allow for the more accurate characterization of changes in the ALC. The protocol was
reviewed and approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional
Review Board and registered with the National Institute
of Health (clinicaltrials.gov). All patients provided written
informed consent before study enrollment in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Protocol Treatment

Polyphenon E capsules containing approximately 200 mg
of EGCG were supplied by the NCI or directly by Polyphenon E International, Inc (New York, NY). All patients
in the phase 2 portion of the trial received Polyphenon E
at a dose of 1000 mg orally twice per day for the first 7
days of cycle 1, at which point the dose was increased to
364

2000 mg orally twice per day. Polyphenon E was administered with a light meal/snack. All study subjects were provided with a medication diary to indicate the time and
quantity of medication usage that was reviewed at each
follow-up visit. Patients remained on active treatment for
up to 6 months and were evaluated once every 4 weeks by
physical examination and laboratory testing. Treatment
was discontinued in the event of excessive toxicity or progressive disease (PD) as defined by the NCI-WG criteria.8
At the completion of 6 months of active treatment,
patients entered observation. With the approval of the
treating hematologist, patients who had not experienced
disease progression and who desired to remain on treatment were provided with Polyphenon E capsules at their
assigned dose level for up to 12 additional months.
Toxicity was graded using NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0). Because
there is a low tolerance for toxicity in the treatment of
patients with CLL who do not meet standard criteria for
PD, dose modifications were required for adverse events
of > grade 1 that were attributed to Polyphenon E and
that did not respond to supportive care. In general, for
patients with grade 2 adverse events attributed to Polyphenon E, therapy was withheld until symptoms resolved to
 grade 1, at which time therapy was reinitiated at the
original dose along with supportive care measures. For
patients with adverse events of grade 3 to 4 that were
attributed to study treatment or recurrent grade 2 events,
Polyphenon E was withheld until symptoms resolved to
 grade 1 and then was reinitiated at the next lower dose
level (reduction of 200 mg per dose) along with supportive care measures. Due to a mandate from the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA), the notable exception
to this approach was the response to any elevation in
transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] or alanine aminotransferase [ALT]), in which case Polyphenon
E was withheld for grade 1 adverse events regardless of
attribution until these values returned to normal, at which
time Polyphenon E was reinitiated at the same dose level.
If grade 1 transaminitis recurred, Polyphenon E was withheld and reinitiated at the next lower dose (a reduction of
200 mg twice daily) once AST or ALT values had returned
to normal. Regardless of attribution, patients with 
grade 2 transaminitis were required by the FDA to permanently discontinue study treatment.
Risk Stratification Parameters

defects, and immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region
(IGHV) gene mutation testing as previously
described.23,24
Criteria for Response

The best response during the 6 months of active therapy
was evaluated using the NCI-WG criteria.22 Given the
favorable toxicity profile of Polyphenon E in healthy
adults16 and the intention to evaluate the efficacy of this
agent to delay or prevent PD in patients with CLL, we
also evaluated an additional response category termed
‘‘biologic response’’ among patients who did not meet
standard NCI-WG criteria for complete or partial
response. The criteria for a biologic response were prospectively defined in the study protocol after discussion
and approval of this endpoint by the NCI because of recognition that anticancer botanicals such as Polyphenon E
may work through unique, noncytotoxic mechanisms.
These criteria were evaluated and published for the
patients participating in the phase 1 trial18 before the
phase 2 trial was initiated. Biologic response was defined
as a reduction in the ALC of > 20% from the pretreatment level that was sustained for at least 2 months or a 
30% reduction in all palpable lymphadenopathy. Biologic
response evaluation was included as a primary endpoint in
the study protocol with NCI approval to ensure that the
study assessed the potential ability of EGCG to prevent
CLL progression in patients who did not achieve a conventional response.
Plasma Polyphenol Levels

Trough (approximately 12 hours after the last dose)
plasma EGCG levels were measured at the end of the first
month of therapy by one of the authors (C.S.Y.) using an
established high-performance liquid chromatography
procedure with a Coulochem electrode array system
(Thermo Scientific, Chelmsford, Mass).25
Statistical Analysis

The primary outcomes for this phase 2 trial were the
assessment of tolerability and clinical response. Confirmed clinical responses (NCI-WG complete or partial
remission) on 2 consecutive evaluations (eg, over a 2month interval) and biologic responses as defined earlier
were used as measures of clinical response and were summarized using simple descriptive statistics. Differences in
response by key patient characteristics (ie, ZAP-70 status)
were compared using the Fisher exact test. Correlations
between the plasma EGCG level and dose/response were
evaluated with the Spearman rank coefficient and the Wilcoxon rank sum test when appropriate. Treatment-free

RESULTS
Patient Demographics

A total of 37 patients were accrued to the phase 2 portion
of the study between September 2007 and October 2010.
One patient was deemed ineligible for evaluation because
the study drug was not administered correctly during cycle
1. As per protocol, the remaining 36 patients along with
the 6 patients in the phase 1 portion of the trial who were
treated at the phase 2 dose level were evaluated to determine the tolerability and efficacy of the phase 2 dose level
(42 patients). The clinical characteristics of these 42 eligible patients are presented in Table 1. A majority of
patients (29 patients; 69%) had Rai stage I to II disease.
The majority of patients had favorable prognostic profiles
on FISH, ZAP-70, CD38, and IGHV gene mutation
analyses at the time of study entry consistent with the eligibility requirements that patients be asymptomatic and
have earlier stage disease.
Toxicity and Tolerability

The median overall compliance with the prescribed dose
as assessed using pill diaries was 96% (range, 51%104%). During the 6 months of active treatment, 13 of

effects at least possibly attributed to therapy during the 6
months of active treatment were generally mild, with 18
patients (43%) having a maximum of a grade 2 event and
3 patients (7%) experiencing a grade 3 event (Table 2).
Thirty patients completed 6 cycles of active therapy.
Twelve patients discontinued therapy early: 9 patients
experienced an adverse event and 3 developed PD. As per

Response to Therapy

One patient treated at the phase 2 dose level of the phase 1
trial achieved a partial remission according to the NCIWG criteria. The majority of patients (67%) had a reduction in the ALC (Table 3) (Fig. 2 Top) that was transient
in some patients whereas others experienced a steady, sustained stepwise reduction throughout the 6 months of
active therapy. Among the 22 patients (52%) who had a
 20% reduction in their ALC, 13 (31% of the overall
study population) had a sustained decrease  20% persisting for at least 2 months and thus fulfilled the criteria for a
biologic response. Among patients who completed 6
cycles of therapy, the ALC at the completion of therapy
was below the baseline in 15 patients (47%). Among the

DISCUSSION
Although a majority of patients with CLL have Rai stage 0
to I disease at the time of diagnosis, approximately 70%
eventually progress to require treatment and a majority
will ultimately die of CLL or CLL-related complications.26-30 Accordingly, patients with asymptomatic early
to intermediate stage CLL represent an appropriate
patient population in which to test the ability of nutraceutical agents with a favorable toxicity profile to prevent
or delay PD. This approach is conceptually different from
the early administration of conventional chemotherapy,28,31 since it i) does not prematurely expend/exhaust
an agent to be used as a treatment later in the course of the
disease, ii) is less likely to cause major toxicity (eg, DNA
damage) and iii) should not induce chemotherapy resistance. In this phase 2 trial, EGCG in the Polyphenon E
preparation was found to be well tolerated at a dose of
2000 mg orally administered twice per day for 6 months
in patients with asymptomatic, Rai stage 0 to II CLL. The
most severe toxicity was  grade 2 for 93% of patients.
Although eligibility for this phase 2 trial required a higher
baseline ALC than our previous phase 1 trial (ie, 10 
109/L vs 5  109/L), the clinical activity observed was
nearly identical to the phase 1 study, with approximately
30% of patients experiencing a sustained decline in their
ALC of  20% and approximately 70% of those with
lymphadenopathy at the time of study entry experiencing
a  50% reduction in the sum of the lymph node products during treatment. Overall, approximately 70% of
patients achieved a biologic response, a protocol-specified
endpoint developed after discussion and approval by the
NCI before the previously published phase 1 study.18 No
difference in the percentage of patients achieving a biologic response was observed based on ZAP-70, CD38, or
IGHV gene mutation status. This rate of biologic
responses exceeded the protocol-specified decision rule
that a biologic response rate of  50% would suggest that
EGCG was worthy of further clinical testing.
A higher percentage of patients achieved a biologic
response in the phase 2 trial compared with the phase 1
study (approximately 70% vs 55%). This occurred even
though the phase 2 trial accrued a higher percentage of
patients with Rai stage I to II CLL (69% vs 45%). The
Cancer

January 15, 2013

EGCG for CLL/Shanafelt et al

higher biologic response rate could have occurred because
the phase 2 trial enrolled exclusively EGCG-naive
patients. Alternatively, this finding could suggest that
higher doses of EGCG are more effective. This possibility
is supported by the higher rate of biologic responses noted
in patients being treated with doses  1200 mg twice
daily in the phase 1 study compared with those receiving
< 1200 mg twice daily (biologic response rate of 76% vs
17%) and the observation that EGCG plasma levels were
correlated with reductions in lymphadenopathy in the
phase 2 trial.
Although spontaneous regressions occasionally
occur in patients with CLL, such remissions are rare
(approximately 1% in most series32-34). Although fluctuations in ALC and lymphadenopathy can be expected in a
subset of patients, the expected pattern for the majority of
patients is that of a rising ALC and progressive lymphadenopathy. Among the patients completing 6 months of
EGCG, the ALC at the completion of therapy was below
baseline in approximately 50% and the sum of the lymph
node products at the completion of therapy was below
baseline for approximately 65% of patients. The rapid
decline in ALC and/or lymphadenopathy observed in a
majority of patients after the initiation of therapy with
EGCG also strongly suggests that this was a treatment
effect. This conclusion is supported by the effect of the
cessation of EGCG therapy in patients who developed
grade 2 transaminitis. Three of these 6 patients(patients 1,
2, and 5) (Fig. 1) experienced a rapid and substantial
(approximately 50%) decline in their ALC within the first
2 months of the initiation of treatment with EGCG followed by an immediate return to near pretreatment levels
after discontinuing EGCG.
Although approximately 70% of the patients in the
current study had Rai stage I to II CLL, it should be
emphasized that the patients who were enrolled were
asymptomatic and did not meet criteria to initiate conventional chemotherapy.22 It is unknown whether the modest
clinical effects observed translate into a delay in PD or the
need for subsequent chemotherapy. It should also be
emphasized that EGCG can in no way be considered a
substitute for traditional chemotherapy and/or monoclonal antibody-based treatment once the need for treatment
develops.22 The EGCG-containing preparation used in
the current study was a pharmaceutical-grade product
with a standardized and verified EGCG dose/content confirmed by the NCI and/or the pharmaceutical manufacturer. Accordingly, it is unknown how the clinical effects
reported herein translate to use of over-the-counter, food
supplement-grade EGCG-containing products that are
Cancer

not subject to stringent quality control. Furthermore,
some animal studies have suggested that a mixture of polyphenols is needed for maximum antitumor effect35-37 and
it is unknown whether the effects observed were related to
polyphenols present in Polyphenon E other than EGCG
or the specific composition of this EGCG-containing
preparation. Although correlative in vitro studies in the
current trial did not suggest that EGCG induced resistance to fludarabine or chlorambucil, it is unknown
whether these are an accurate approximation of in vivo
effects or whether long-term use of EGCG-containing
products may influence future sensitivity to conventional
chemotherapeutic agents.
There remains great interest on the part of both
patients with CLL and their physicians in identifying lowtoxicity interventions with the potential to delay PD, particularly for those patients whose molecular prognostic
markers (eg, ZAP-70 or IGHV mutation status) predict a
higher risk of PD. An effective disease-stabilizing agent
must be both efficacious and safe enough for extended use
because short-term administration would not be expected
to substantially affect the risk of PD over the longer term.
EGCG appears to fulfill many of these criteria. Oral
EGCG preparations with improved bioavailability are
also being developed38-40 and could be more effective.
Ultimately, the ability of EGCG or other nutraceutical
compounds to delay PD will need to be determined in a
randomized trial.
