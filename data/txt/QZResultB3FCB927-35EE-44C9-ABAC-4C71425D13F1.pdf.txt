Abstract
Nur77 is a steroid orphan receptor that plays a critical role in regulating proliferation, differentiation, and
apoptosis, including acting as a switch for Bcl-2 function. We previously reported that the octaketide cytosporone B (Csn-B) is a natural agonist for Nur77. In this study, we synthesized a series of Csn-B analogues and
performed a structure-activity analysis that suggested criteria for the development of a unique pharmacophore to activate Nur77. The components of the pharmacophore necessary for binding Nur77 included the
benzene ring, the phenolic hydroxyl group, and the acyl chain of the Csn-B scaffold, whereas the key feature for
activating the biological function of Nur77 was the ester group. Csn-B analogues that bound Nur77 tightly not
only stimulated its transactivation activity but also initiated mitochondrial apoptosis by means of novel crosstalk between Nur77 and BRE, an antiapoptotic protein regulated at the transcriptional level. Notably, the derivative n-amyl 2-[3,5-dihydroxy-2-(1-nonanoyl)phenyl]acetate exhibited greater antitumor activity in vivo than
its parent compounds, highlighting particular interest in this compound. Our findings describe a pathway for
rational design of Csn-B–derived Nur77 agonists as a new class of potent and effective antitumor agents.

Introduction
The mouse Nur77 orphan receptor (also called NGFI-B in
rats or TR3 in humans) is a member of the steroid/thyroid/
retinoid nuclear receptor superfamily. It participates in a variety of biological processes, including T-cell development
(1, 2), inflammatory responses (3–5), steroid hormone synthesis (6–8), and hepatic glucose metabolism (9). Nur77 also
influences programmed cell death in response to apoptotic
stimuli (10–12). In one of its roles, Nur77 functions as a transcription factor by binding to its response elements and negatively
or positively regulating the transcription of its apoptosisassociated target genes (13, 14). Additionally, Nur77 acts as a
regulatory factor by translocating from the nucleus to the

mitochondria, where it interacts with and conformationally
converts Bcl-2 to an apoptosis-promoting trigger (15).
A variety of agents have been used to induce Nur77-mediated
apoptosis in different cell types, such as 9-cis-retinoic acid, 1-di
(3-indolyl)-1-(4-X-phenyl)methanes (16, 17), etoposide (18),
5,8-diacetoxyl-6-(1′-acetoxy-4′-methyl-3′-pentenyl)-1,4naphthaquinones (19), and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13acetate (20, 21). However, those compounds regulate Nur77
biological activity through an indirect mechanism. We found
that 9-cis-retinoic acid induces heterodimerization of its
receptor retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) with Nur77, which facilitates their nucleocytoplasmic translocation to the mitochondria. Upon reaching the mitochondria, Nur77 alone initiates
apoptosis (10). Thus, apoptotic stimuli seem to trigger Nur77mediated apoptosis in an indirect, multicomponent fashion.
To date, no physiologic ligand for Nur77 has been identified. The synthetic Nur77 agonists 1,1-di(3-indolyl)-1(p-substituted-phenyl)methanes (DIM-arenes) have been
shown to affect Nur77 activation in a structure-dependent
manner. Interestingly, DIM-arenes also act as transcriptional
agonists for PPARγ and RXRα (22), suggesting that they are
not specific agonists for Nur77. We recently found that the
natural product cytosporone B (Csn-B), an Nur77 agonist isolated from Dothiorella sp. HTF3 (23), has the ability to directly
bind to and activate Nur77, leading to induction of apoptosis
via translocation of Nur77 to the mitochondria (24). Moreover,
Csn-B does not have any effect on the transcription of reporter
genes for the retinoic acid receptor response element, the estrogen receptor response element, or the thyroid receptor response element (24), thereby showing the specificity of Csn-B

A Pharmacophore for Activation of Nur77

for Nur77. However, as is the case with many natural products,
the lack of availability of significant quantities of Csn-B due to
the low concentrations of active principles extracted from
bacterial fermentation limits its further use.
Structural modification of natural products can result in molecules with improved properties, such as adequate production
quantity, reduced toxicity, or enhanced efficacy. For example,
milataxel, a novel paclitaxel analogue in clinical trials, is 140
times more effective than paclitaxel (25). In an attempt to find
a molecule possessing similar functions to Csn-B but with enhanced Nur77-binding and activating properties, a series of
novel analogues was synthesized. After evaluating the Csn-B
analogues, we identified a unique pharmacophore capable of
binding and activating Nur77. Furthermore, we found that
Csn-B analogues promote Nur77 antitumor activity through a
novel cross-talk between Nur77 and brain and reproductive organ-expressed protein (BRE). BRE, a death receptor–associated
protein, specifically downregulates death receptor–mediated
apoptosis by inhibiting activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (26, 27). The Csn-B analogues prepared in this
study repress the transcriptional activity of BRE through recruitment of corepressor N-CoR. Importantly, this event is
mediated by Nur77. Our results also show that n-amyl 2-[3,5dihydroxy-2-(1-nonanoyl)phenyl]acetate, the most effective
derivative, exhibits remarkable anticancer activity in a tumor
xenograft model, thus suggesting the potential of our novel
Nur77 agonists as therapeutic agents for cancer treatment.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and knockout mice. Human gastric cancer BGC823 cells purchased from the Institute of Cell Biology of China were
maintained in RPMI 1640. To establish stable BGC-823 cell
lines that expressed siNur77 or pNurRE-Luc, plasmids of siNur77 or pNurRE-Luc together with pCDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen)
were transfected into cells using FuGENE HD (Roche). The stably
transfected cells were selected by G418 (300 μg/mL, Sigma).
Nur77−/− C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory.
Molecular docking. The three-dimensional geometry data
file for Nur77 ligand-binding domain (LBD) was obtained
from the Protein Data Bank (PDB code 2QW4). The initial
structure of Csn-B analogues was generated by ACDLABS
12.0 and minimized by MolSoft ICM molmechanics (Molsoft
LLC) with the Cartesian Merck Molecular Force Field. The
MolSoft ICM 3.5a program was selected for the docking of
Csn-B analogues to Nur77(LBD).
Synthesis of Csn-B analogues. To study the structureactivity relationships, different series of cytosporone analogues
were designed and synthesized (Supplementary Fig. S1). All
synthetic compounds were fully characterized by 1H nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR), 13C NMR, mass spectrometry,
and elemental analysis. The detailed synthetic approaches
and spectroscopic data are outlined in Supplementary Data.
All compounds were dissolved in DMSO and stored at −80°C.
Construction of plasmids. The region of the BRE promoter
spanning bp −1,800 to +134 (containing a NBRE consensus
AAAGGTCA) was subcloned into the pGL2 luciferase reporter
vector (Promega) to generate pLuc-BRE. pLuc-BREmut (NBRE

www.aacrjournals.org

point mutation; AAAGAACA) was obtained by using the
QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).
To silence the expression of Nur77, the oligonucleotide
siNur77 (5′-ACA GTC CAG CCA TGC TCC T-3′) was inserted
into the pSuper vector (OligoEngine).
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Cells were
fixed with 70% ethanol, treated with RNase A (0.25 mg/mL,
Roche), and stained with propidium iodide (0.02 mg/mL, Sigma).
Samples were analyzed using a FACScan system (BD Biosciences).
Confocal microscopy. Staining procedures were performed
as previously described (28). Antibodies including Nur77 (rabbit polyclonal antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), cytochrome c (mouse monoclonal antibody, Santa Cruz), AIF
(rabbit polyclonal antibody, Sigma), and Hsp60 (mouse monoclonal antibody, Santa Cruz) were used. The images were
captured using a Leica SP laser scan microscope system.
Preparation of nuclear, cytosolic, and mitochondrial
fractions and Western blotting. The preparation of nuclear,
cytosolic, and mitochondrial fractions and Western blotting were
performed according to the methods previously described (29).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin
immunoprecipitation assay. Electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (EMSA) was carried out using a LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce Chemical Co.) with biotin-labeled
oligonucleotides (Invitrogen; ref. 28). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed as described previously (29).
Xenograft experiment. Five-week-old male athymic BALB/
c nude mice were purchased from the Laboratory Animal
Center. BGC-823 cells were injected s.c. into the right flank
of each mouse (106 cells per 50 μL PBS). The Csn-B analogues
dissolved in DMSO and then mixed with 50 μL corn oil were
injected into the tumor areas every other day at a dose of 10
mg/kg body weight, whereas the negative control group was
injected with vehicle. Synthesized Csn-B (compound 10a)
was used as a positive control. Tissues were further examined
by immunohistochemistry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assays
as detailed previously (24).
Circular dichroism spectroscopy and fluorescence
quenching assay. As previously described (24), circular dichroism (CD) measurements were carried out using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (JASCO). The α-helical contents of unbound and
bound proteins were calculated according to the formula (30).
For fluorescence quenching, a HITACHI fluorescence spectrophotometer (model F-4500, Hitachi) was used. The dissociation constants were determined by fluorescence quenching
as previously described (31, 32).
Luciferase assays. The relative NurRE luciferase activity
was measured as described previously (33). The luciferase assay
of the BRE promoter was conducted as mentioned above. To
detect the in vivo transcriptional activity, pLuc-BRE (700 ng/g
body weight) was mixed with 1 mL of reagents from the hepatocytes transfection kit (Mirus Bio Corp.) and injected into the
tail vein of C57BL/6 mice (34).
Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential.
Cells (2 × 105 per chamber) were harvested and incubated
with JC-1 (5 μg/mL, Sigma) at 37°C for 10 minutes and then
analyzed using a FACScan unit (BD Biosciences).

Results
Determination of the critical components of Csn-B
analogues for Nur77 targeting. Recently, we described
how Csn-B acts as an agonist by binding specifically to the

LBD of Nur77 to activate its transactivating function (24).
The structure of Csn-B (in Fig. 1A, synthetic Csn-B is named
as 10a) features a core benzene ring functionalized by two
hydroxyl groups, an acyl group and an ester group. However,
the roles these moieties play in the binding of Csn-B to Nur77

remain unknown. To evaluate the structural features of Csn-B
that are required for interaction with Nur77, we synthesized
five series of cytosporone analogues with the aid of molecular
docking that predicted the Csn-B analogues capable of binding
to Nur77. First, we identified a hydrogen bond (indicated by an
arrow) that formed between the hydroxyl group ortho to the
acyl group of Csn-B and Y122 of Nur77(LBD) {equal to Y453 in
full-length Nur77; ref. 24; Fig. 1A, ethyl 2-[3,5-dihydroxy-2(1-octanoyl)phenyl]acetate (10a)}. The docked pose for 10a
suggests that, when the hydroxyl group was shifted meta to
the acyl group, the hydrogen bond could also form {Fig. 1A,
ethyl 2-[4-hydroxy-2-(nonanoyl)phenyl]acetate (22)}. When
this 3-hydroxyl group was replaced by a 2-acetamido group
{Fig. 1A, ethyl 2-[3-acetamino-2-(octanoyl)phenyl]acetate
(35)}, another conformation was observed that would not permit hydrogen bond formation. Deletion of the 5-hydroxyl
group located para to the acyl group {Fig. 1A, ethyl 2-

www.aacrjournals.org

[3-hydroxy-2-(octanoyl)phenyl]acetate (29)} did not affect
the docked pose for 29, so that hydrogen bond between the
3-hydroxyl group and the Y122 hydroxyl group could be maintained. The dissociation constant for 29 was decreased by only
0.2 μmol/L. These results support our previous hypothesis that
Y453 of full-length Nur77 [i.e., Y122 of Nur77(LBD)] is important for the protein's capacity to interact with Csn-B by what
seems to be the formation of a hydrogen bond (24).
Next, we investigated the roles of the other two functional
groups present on the benzene ring by deleting either the
acyl group or the alkyl ester. When glutathione S-transferase
(GST)–Nur77(LBD) protein was incubated with increasing
amounts of 1-[(3,5-dihydroxy)phenyl]octan-1-one (14), the
fluorescence intensity of the complex gradually decreased;
however, when the protein was incubated with ethyl
2-[(3,5-dihydroxy)phenyl]acetate (8a), no such decrease was
observed (Supplementary Fig. S2). Molecular docking suggested that the aforementioned hydrogen bond was present
in the complex of Nur77 with 14, but not with 8a (Fig. 1A).
Given that 14 only has an acyl group while 8a only possesses
the acetate moiety, it is likely that the acyl group coupled
with the benzene ring is responsible for Nur77 binding. Importantly, when the carbonyl group was transformed into a
hydroxyl group, the benzene ring was positioned away from
Y122 of Nur77(LBD) {Fig. 1A, 1-[(3,5-dihydroxy)phenyl]-1octanol (15)}. In this orientation, the hydroxyl group of 15
on the benzene was unable to form a hydrogen bond with
Y122 of Nur77(LBD), suggesting that the trigonal planar electron domain (sp2) geometry of the carbonyl group orients its
alkyl chain for maximal interaction with hydrophobic groups
in the binding pocket of Nur77(LBD).
To further explore the importance of the acyl group in the
Csn-B analogues for Nur77 binding, a series of Csn-B analogues that varied only in the length of the acyl group was synthesized. The values of their respective dissociation constants
are reported in Fig. 1B. The compound with a decanoyl group
{ethyl 2-[3,5-dihydroxy-2-(1-decanoyl)phenyl]acetate (10j)}
exhibited stronger affinity for GST-Nur77(LBD) than one
with a nonanoyl group {ethyl 2-[3,5-dihydroxy-2-(1-nonanoyl)
phenyl]acetate (10f)}, which in turn had a greater affinity than
the compound with an octanoyl group (10a). However, ethyl 2[3,5-dihydroxy-2-(1-undecanoyl)phenyl]acetate (10e), which
possesses an undecanoyl group, exhibited no better binding
than 10j. This is probably due to the folding of the alkyl tail
in 10e, which compensates for its additional two carbons by
assuming a cisoid conformation (Supplementary Fig. S3). Thus,
various acyl groups may govern the efficiency of the
association of Csn-B analogues with Nur77.
The alkyl ester is responsible for activation of Nur77.
Three additional series of compounds were further synthesized based on the structures of compounds 10a,
10f, and 10j: the acyl group was fixed for each series,
but the ester alkyl chain was lengthened (Fig. 2). Comparison
of the dissociation constants reveals that increasing the number
of carbons of the ester alkyl chain also resulted in tighter binding compounds, among which n-amyl 2-[3,5-dihydroxy-2(1-nonanoyl)phenyl]acetate (10i) exhibited the highest affinity
(Fig. 2).

BGC-823 cells expressing pNurRE-Luc were treated with Csn-B analogues for 6 h, and the reporter gene activity was determined by a luciferase
assay and normalized to the β-galactosidase activity. The basal level of transcriptional activity was normalized to 1. B and C, Csn-B analogues trigger cell
death by apoptosis. BGC-823 cells were incubated with different Csn-B analogues (10 μmol/L, 24 h) and then stained with propidium iodide (PI) to assess
cell viability and subgenomic DNA fragmentation by flow cytometry, respectively. Columns, means from three independent experiments; bars, SEM.
**, P < 0.01. D, CD spectroscopic analysis of the binding of Csn-B analogues to GST-Nur77(LBD) with consequent conformational changes.

We next explored the structure-activity relationship of the
various alkyl esters. The transactivation activity induced by
Csn-B analogues was first evaluated by a luciferase assay.
When BGC-823 cells stably expressing a reporter gene for
Nur77 (NurRE) were treated with various compounds, the
transactivation activity of Nur77 increased in response to most
of the analogues that exhibited high affinities for Nur77. We
noted that induction followed a regular pattern with respect
to altering the length of the ester alkyl chain (Fig. 3A). As expected, the three compounds (8a, 15, and 35) that lacked affinity for Nur77 had no effect on the transactivation activity.
These data suggest that the ability of Csn-B analogues to activate Nur77 transactivation is associated with their affinity for
Nur77 in a structure-dependent manner, with the ester moiety
playing a particularly important role.
We also examined cell viability in response to these compounds. Compounds 8a, 15, and 35 were not toxic to BGC823 cells. However, other compounds caused cell death to
varying degrees (Fig. 3B). Intriguingly, many round, suspended
cells were observed in the culture medium treated with the
Csn-B compounds (data not shown), suggesting that an apoptotic event had occurred. Thus, we determined whether the
Csn-B analogues inhibited the growth of gastric cancer cells
through an apoptotic mechanism in BGC-823 cells. Compounds 8a, 15, and 35 did not induce apoptosis, whereas
∼10% to ∼60% of the cells were apoptotic after treatment
with the other compounds (Fig. 3C). This result was consistent

3632

with the cell viability assay and showed that Csn-B analogue–
induced cell death occurs via apoptosis. Interestingly,
although 14 did activate Nur77 transactivation to some degree, it exerted no apoptotic effects in BGC-823 cells, further
supporting the conclusion that the ester moiety is indispensable for the apoptosis-inducing function of Nur77.
The low-energy binding conformation of Csn-B
analogues facilitates Nur77 activation. To evaluate how
the acetate moiety of Csn-B analogues influences their function, we chose 10f and 10i for further analysis because they
harbor the same acyl group but have different ester alkyl
chain lengths. Compound 10a was used as a positive control.
Docking revealed that these three compounds may bind to
Nur77(LBD) in similar ways by targeting the Y122 residue
(Supplementary Fig. S4). In addition, CD spectroscopic assays
verified that 10a, 10f, and 10i specifically bound to GSTLBD; however, as a negative control, the CD spectra of GST
remain unchanged when GST proteins were incubated with
10i (Fig. 3D). Upon binding, the three compounds caused the
conformation change of GST-Nur77(LBD) as indicated by
the changes in ellipticity values of 36.5%, 32.2%, and 30.0%
in bound protein forms 10a-GST-LBD, 10f-GST-LBD, and
10i-GST-LBD, respectively, compared with 55.4% obtained
from the unbound GST-LBD protein form.
We asked why 10i is the strongest activator of Nur77
among the three compounds. Molecular docking data indicated that this series of compounds may achieve a relatively

blot assay (bottom). D, Csn-B analogues induce cleavage of caspases and PARP. BGC-823 cells were treated with the Csn-B analogues as indicated

low-energy conformation when docked into the available
crystal structure of Nur77(LBD). Comparison of the docking
solutions arising from the highest predicted binding affinities
for each compound revealed that 10i achieved the best docking scores, followed by 10f and then 10a. With respect to the
ICM scores, 10i exhibits the lowest energy (−81.5), followed
by 10f (−71.5), and then 10a (−65.4). The hydrophobicities of
the compounds (represented as log P) were ranked from
greatest to least: 10i (log P, 7.33), 10f (log P, 5.74), and 10a
(log P, 5.21). The log P value for 8a, which failed to bind
Nur77, was 1.04. Clearly, greater hydrophobicity of Csn-B
analogues facilitates Nur77 binding.
Nur77 is required for Csn-B analogue–induced
apoptosis. Among these three Csn-B analogues (10a, 10f,
and 10i), compound 10i is the most potent for inducing apoptosis in BGC-823 cells. To thoroughly investigate whether
Nur77 is required for apoptosis induced by 10i, we stably
knocked down the expression of Nur77 in BGC-823 cells with
a specific siRNA against Nur77. Silencing the expression of
Nur77 greatly reduced the apoptosis induced by 10i from
49.04% to 10.8% (Fig. 4A). Similarly, the mitochondrial membrane potential was attenuated by treatment with 10i in a

time-and dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S5).
In contrast, in the presence of 10i, the mitochondrial membrane potential remained unchanged compared with the
control group when Nur77 was knocked down (Fig. 4B). Thus,
these data indicate that 10i induces apoptosis through a
Nur77-mediated process.
Because Csn-B analogues decrease the mitochondrial
membrane potential, and given that mitochondrial localization of Nur77 causes a mitochondrial permeability transition
(15), we suspected that 10i may cause mitochondrial localization of Nur77 and then initiate apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, we examined the localization of Nur77 and several
other mitochondrial apoptosis-related proteins such as cytochrome c (35) and AIF (36) in BGC-823 cells. Nur77 was indeed translocated from the nucleus to the mitochondria after
10i treatment (Fig. 4C, top). As a consequence, mitochondrial Cyt c was released into the cytoplasm and mitochondrial
AIF was redistributed in both cytoplasm and nucleus. Consistent with this result, Western blot analysis of subcellular fractionated samples from BGC-823 cells also showed a similar
pattern of Nur77, Cyt c, and AIF redistribution (Fig. 4C, bottom).
Moreover, the critical apoptotic events of cleavage of caspase-9,

β-galactosidase activity was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. After treatment with 10i (6 h), the activities of the reporter gene were determined
by a luciferase assay (left). The same reporter and β-galactosidase were injected into the tail vein of Nur77+/+ and Nur77−/− C57BL/6 mice (n = 5 for
each group). After 5 h, mice were given i.p. 50 μL vehicle (DMSO) or 10i (50 mg/kg body weight). At 24-h posttransfection, the luciferase activities in
liver lysates were determined (right). Data were obtained from three independent experiments and presented as the means ± SEM. **, P < 0.01.
D, Csn-B analogues regulate recruitment of cofactors to the BRE promoter. BGC-823 cells were transfected with Flag-SRC-2 or HA-N-CoR, followed
by treatment of Csn-B analogues as indicated (5 μmol/L, 5 h). The recruitment of cofactors to the NBRE on the BRE promoter was analyzed by
ChIP assay.

A Pharmacophore for Activation of Nur77

Figure 6. Csn-B analogues inhibit

caspase-3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were also
induced (Fig. 4D). These results clearly show that localization
of Nur77 to the mitochondria is required to trigger Csn-B
analogue–induced apoptosis.
Csn-B analogues repress the transcriptional activity of
BRE through Nur77. To identify novel apoptotic genes specifically responsible for Nur77 regulation, we performed a
Gene Chip analysis and found that a novel downstream gene,
BRE (brain and reproductive organ-expressed protein), was
dramatically repressed by Csn-B.3 Although BRE is a known
antiapoptotic protein that functions by inhibiting the
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (26, 27), a regulatory mechanism involving BRE and Nur77 is unknown. Reverse
transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) analysis confirmed that endogenous BRE mRNA levels were indeed reduced by three compounds, 10a, 10f, or 10i (Fig. 5A). Sequence analysis of the
BRE promoter revealed a potential monomeric Nur77 binding site (NBRE) located between −1,602 and −1,595 bp, suggesting that Nur77 may bind to the BRE promoter and
regulate its transcription. We therefore evaluated the DNAbinding properties of Nur77 by examining its ability to bind
the BRE promoter using EMSA. As shown in Fig. 5B, Nur77
directly bound to the NBRE of the BRE promoter, and the
binding was specifically reversed by competing with cold

oligonucleotides. The NBRE mutation within the BRE promoter
completely abolished the formation of DNA-protein complexes. A
luciferase assay was performed to further study the BRE promoter
activity regulated by Nur77 in response to 10i. Consistent with
the result shown above, the transcriptional activity of BRE in
BGC-823 cells was decreased with 10i treatment. However, when
NBRE in the BRE promoter was mutated, inhibition of BRE transcriptional activity by 10i was not observed (Fig. 5C, left). Furthermore, we used Nur77+/+ and Nur77−/− C57BL/6 mice to analyze
the effect of 10i on the transcriptional activity of BRE in vivo.
The reporter gene for BRE was injected along with transfection
reagent into the tail vein of both groups of mice. Similarly, the
transcriptional activity of BRE was significantly repressed by 10i
in hepatocytes of Nur77+/+ mice (P < 0.01); by contrast, 10i failed
to exert such an inhibitory effect in hepatocytes of Nur77−/−
mice (Fig. 5C, right). These data consistently indicate that
Nur77 is involved in 10i-regulated BRE transcriptional activity.
Nur77 requires cofactor binding to positively or negatively
modulate the transactivation of its target genes, including
coactivator SRC-2 for transcriptional activation (24, 37, 38)
and corepressor N-CoR for transcriptional repression
(39, 40). To test whether Csn-B analogues have the ability
to regulate the recruitment of cofactors to the BRE promoter,
we performed ChIP assays in BGC-823 cells. As shown in
Fig. 5D, all three compounds, 10a, 10f, and 10i, promoted
Nur77 and recruited N-CoR but retarded recruitment of
SRC-2 to the BRE promoter. This result supports the notion that

Nur77 inhibits transcription of BRE by regulating cofactor recruitment, which may lead to a repressed initiation of transcription.
Csn-B analogues inhibit tumor growth in vivo. We finally
assessed therapeutic effects of 10i in a xenograft tumorigenesis model, in which BGC-823 cells were used to generate
tumors in the nude mice. After injection of BGC-823 cells into
the mice, 10i (10 mg/kg body weight) was given to the mice by
intratumoral injection every other day for a total of 11 cycles.
Three weeks later, the tumors were dissected and weighed.
Compound 10a was used as a positive control. As shown
in Fig. 6A and B, tumor xenograft growth was significantly
reduced in volume upon treatment with 10a and 10i. Tumor weight inhibitions of 68.7% (P < 0.01) for 10i and
38.0% (P < 0.05) for 10a were obtained.
Immunohistochemistry was performed to further examine
the localization of Nur77 in the xenograft tumor. Nur77 was
predominantly located in the cytosol in the 10i-treated tissue
sections, whereas Nur77 was primarily located in the nucleus
in the control group (Fig. 6C, top). Moreover, Western
blotting indicated the cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3, and
PARP accompanied increasing Nur77 protein levels in the
10i-treated group (Fig. 6D). TUNEL assays consistently
indicated a large number of apoptotic cells in the 10i-treated
tissue section (Fig. 6C, bottom). These data further support
the claim that translocation of Nur77 is required for Csn-B
analogues to induce apoptosis in vivo.

Discussion
Nur77 is expressed in various types of cells and tissues,
and it executes a complex series of biological functions. Recent studies have illustrated that Nur77 is an important target for cancer therapy (16, 17, 24). This communication has
explored the structure-activity relationship of Csn-B analogues and Nur77 by analyzing a series of chemically synthesized derivatives. The small library of compounds helped
us to establish a core pharmacophore for the activation of
Nur77 by a direct compound-protein interaction.
The pharmacophore contains three key structural features
that are required for Csn-B analogues to bind and activate
Nur77. These features may help guide the further improvement
of the current compounds. First, the presence of a hydroxyl
group para to the acyl group on the benzene ring may be required. This hydroxyl group may closely interact with the receptor molecule through formation of a hydrogen bond with Y122
of Nur77(LBD). Second, the presence of a carbonyl group in the
acyl group may be necessary to make maximal interaction with
hydrophobic groups in the binding pocket of Nur77(LBD)
through its trigonal planar electron domain (sp2) geometry.
Third, the length of the acyl group contributes to the binding
affinity. It seems to be capable of interacting with hydrophobic
residues that line the interior pocket surface of Nur77(LBD),
thereby providing an appropriate balance between steric hindrance and hydrophobicity. In addition, the ester chain may
serve to allow the synthesized Csn-B analogues to induce the
biological activity of Nur77 when the acyl group is present.
Theoretically, the binding affinity of the ligand to the receptor should be governed by both the intrinsic binding energy of

3636

Cancer Res; 70(9) May 1, 2010

the ligand-receptor bond and the structure of the ligand (41).
Because receptor stability is determined by ligand binding,
which reduces the flexibility of the receptor, a minimal energy
surface of ligand with a unique and stable native complex may
be an important prerequisite for receptor-specific binding affinity (42). In this sense, the fact that the derivative n-amyl
2-[3,4-dihydroxy-2-(1-nonanoyl)phenyl]acetate (10i) exhibited binding affinity superior to its parent compounds and
much more effective antitumor activity in both cell culture
and xenograft may be attributed to its having the lowest binding energy. Certainly, extensive physiology tests must still be
performed to fully address the relationship between the energy properties of Nur77 agonists and their biological function.
BRE is an important antiapoptotic gene that acts by inhibiting the mitochondrial apoptotic machinery without translocating to the mitochondria (26), and it may act downstream of
Nur77 as an effector. Mechanistic analysis indicated that
Csn-B analogues may trigger the binding of Nur77 to the BRE
promoter, which contains a conserved Nur77 response element
(NBRE). Promoter binding of Nur77 consequently negatively or
positively regulates the recruitment of cofactors, for example, by
discarding SRC-2 and recruiting N-CoR, thereby downregulating the transcriptional activity of the BRE promoter in both
mouse and cell models. Remarkably, the inhibition of BRE
transcriptional activity by Csn-B analogues was accompanied
by changes in the expression profiles of several mitochondriarelated apoptotic proteins, including caspase-9, caspase-3, and
their substrates, PARP, Cyt c, and AIF. Interestingly, other
groups have also reported a correlation between BRE and
the expression levels of these proteins in the apoptotic
pathway (26). Accordingly, our data suggest a novel nuclearmitochondrial cross-talk in Nur77-BRE apoptosis, during
which the antiapoptotic function of BRE is diminished by
Nur77 at the transcriptional level in response to Csn-B analogues.
In summary, this study describes the identification of a new
pharmacophore based on the structural features of Csn-B analogues that may serve as a foundation for designing and evaluating the next generation of Csn-B derivatives for clinical
applications. Moreover, the discovery that Csn-B analogues
induce apoptosis through Nur77 mediation offers evidence that
Csn-B analogues represent a novel class of anticancer drugs.
