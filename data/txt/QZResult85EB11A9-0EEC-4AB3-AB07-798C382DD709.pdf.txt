ABSTRACT
The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) channel is a novel target for the
treatment of drug-induced long QT syndrome, which causes lethal cardiotoxicity. This
study is designed to explore the possible role of PML SUMOylation and its associated
nuclear bodies (NBs) in the regulation of HERG protein expression. Both arsenic
trioxide (ATO) and angiotensin II (Ang II) were able to significantly reduce HERG
protein expression, while also increasing PML SUMOylation and accelerating the
formation of PML-NBs. Pre-exposure of cardiomyocytes to a SUMOylation chemical
inhibitor, ginkgolic acid, or the silencing of UBC9 suppressed PML SUMOylation,
subsequently preventing the downregulation of HERG induced by ATO or Ang II.
Conversely, knockdown of RNF4 led to a remarkable increase in PML SUMOylation
and the function of PML-NBs, further promoting ATO- or Ang II-induced HERG protein
downregulation. Mechanistically, an increase in PML SUMOylation by ATO or Ang
II dramatically enhanced the formation of PML and Pin1 complexes in PML-NBs,
leading to the upregulation of TGF-β1 protein, eventually inhibiting HERG expression
through activation of protein kinase A. The present work uncovered a novel molecular
mechanism underlying HERG protein expression and indicated that PML SUMOylation
is a critical step in the development of drug-acquired arrhythmia.

INTRODUCTION

of arrhythmias. However, excessive blockade of HERG
currents resulting from inherited mutations or adverse
drug effects can lead to cardiotoxicity, including sudden
death and torsade de pointes, a form of fatal arrhythmia.
These undesirable side effects have prompted withdrawal
of blockbuster drugs from clinical practice [2]. Because
HERG is a significant molecular target of a diverse group
of existing cardiac and non-cardiac drugs that frequently

Human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) encodes
the rapid component of the delayed rectifier potassium
current (IKr) that is the major contributor in depolarizing
cardiac action potentials [1]. Moderate inhibition of

agents is beneficial in the pharmacological management

cause life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in clinical
settings, the role of HERG in cardiac arrhythmias and
drug action has received considerable attention [3]. The
gating characteristics, structure-function relationships, cell
surface trafficking, and allosteric modulation of HERG
have been studied intensively [3, 4].
Drug-induced long QT syndrome is closely related
to HERG current inhibition, which can be caused by a
diverse group of drugs that either directly block the HERG
channel or disrupt HERG channel trafficking to the cell
surface [5]. HERG current can be indirectly reduced by
a decrease in HERG protein abundance and frequently
occurs during drug-acquired arrhythmias. Arsenic trioxide
(ATO) is extensively used in the treatment of acute
promyelocytic leukemia and solid tumors in clinical
practice. The therapeutic use of ATO is burdened by broad
cardiotoxicity that is characterized by a prolonged QT
interval, which can result in life-threatening torsade de
pointes and cardiac death. Substantial evidence has been
collected demonstrating that ATO can disrupt the HERG
current by interfering with trafficking to the cellular
membrane, as well as through reduction in HERG protein
abundance [6]. A previous analysis of ATO-induced long
QT syndrome revealed that ATO treatment of guinea
pigs caused an increase in transforming growth factor β1
(TGF-β1) secretion, while HERG protein expression was
decreased [7]. The levels of angiotensin (Ang II) have been
found to increase during arrhythmia in cases of cardiac
hypertrophy and heart failure. Previous evidence has
suggested that Ang II has an inhibitory effect on IKr/HERG
currents via AT1 receptors linked to the PKC pathway in
ventricular myocytes [8]. Cai et al. also showed that Ang
II reduced the expression of mature HERG channel protein
by accelerating channel proteasomal degradation through
AT1 receptor by PKC activation in HEK-293 cells with
stably expressed HERG channel proteins [9]. However,
the mechanisms that underlie HERG protein expression in
response to these different factors have yet to be elucidated.
Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) has been identified
to be a direct target of ATO, which is associated with
the pathogenesis of leukemia and solid tumors. PML is
the building block for PML-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs)
and serves as a protein scaffold in recruiting interaction
partners that dynamically shuttle in and out of the multifunctional structures. PML modification by the small
ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is essential in recruitment
to these nuclear matrix-related structures, and this
recruitment is mediated by a series of enzymatic reactions.
In the first step of the reaction, the SUMO precursor is
activated by SUMO-activating enzyme (E1) in an ATPdependent manner. Next, SUMO is transferred to the
SUMO-conjugating enzyme (E2), UBC9. The E3 SUMO
ligase alone is not sufficient for SUMO conjugation to
various substrates, but does facilitate SUMO modification.
Subsequently, RNF4, the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin
ligase (characterized as poly-SUMO-2/3-binding factor)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

triggers the degradation of poly-SUMO-chainconjugated substrates through the ubiquitin system [10].
Comprehensive studies of the physiological effects of PML
and associated PML-NBs have already been conducted in
growth control, DNA repair, and apoptosis [11]. However,
the molecular and biochemical mechanisms for ion channel
regulation that are associated with PML remain unclear.
This study was performed to elucidate the functions
of PML SUMOylation and the associated NBs on HERG
protein expression, as well as related regulatory cues. This
may facilitate an understanding and potential control of
HERG-induced cardiotoxicity, allowing for treatment and
prevention in clinical practice.

RESULTS
ATO or Ang II inhibited HERG protein
expression in cardiomyocytes
HERG potassium channels conduct the rapid
delayed rectifier K current, which is responsible for
cardiac excitability and maintenance of normal cardiac
rhythm. HERG is highly expressed in the cell membranes
of neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes (NMCMs), where the
function of HERG is well understood [12]. Immunoblot
analysis indicated that, in cultured NMCMs, HERG
protein appears as two bands, a precursor coreglycosylated, immature isoform (135 kDa) and a higher
molecular band (155 kDa) which corresponds to the
fully-glycosylated, mature HERG protein as described
previously [3]. Exposure to ATO for 24 h at a clinically
relevant concentration (2 μM) visibly decreased the
intensity both of fully-glycosylated and core-glycosylated
HERG proteins (Figure 1A). Similarly, 100 nM Ang II also
caused a significant decrease in HERG protein abundance
in a time-dependent manner (Figure 1B). In addition,
exposure of ATO at 2 μM or Ang II at 100 nM did not
change cardiomyocyte viability (Supplementary Figure 1).

Both ATO and Ang II promoted PML
SUMOylation and PML-NBs accumulation
In order to further study the level of PML
SUMOylation, PML, SUMO-1, and SUMO-2/3 were
labeled with specific antibodies in NMCMs. Short-term
exposure to ATO induced a dramatic shift towards the
SUMO-reactive PML species. The same membranes
were probed with anti-SUMO-1 and anti-SUMO-2/3
antibodies, and revealing an increased global expression
of SUMOs after ATO stimulation (Figure 2A). Similarly,
Ang II triggers a massive shift toward SUMO conjugation
PML after exposure for 4 h, while long exposure of Ang
II for 12 or 24 h reduced SUMOylated PML levels, which
was accompanied by corresponding increased SUMO
expression (Figure 2B). Co-immunoprecipitation indicated
that the high-molecular-weight PML species (> 130 kDa)

was the conjugation of SUMO-1 or SUMO-2/3. Exposure
with ATO for 2 h dramatically increased the conjugation of
SUMO to PML (Figure 2C).
The multi-functional large multi-protein called
PML-NBs, also known as PML oncogenic domains
(POD), nuclear domain 10 (ND10), and Kremer bodies—
are highly dynamic structures that exist within the nuclei of
most mammalian cells [13]. Their biochemical functions
are involved in diverse cellular processes, including
apoptosis, DNA damage, and gene transcription. For this
reason, PML-NBs were examined in ATO- and Ang IItreated NMCMs via immunofluorescence. PML protein
was localized mainly to PML-NBs, with approximately
15 proteins per nucleus under normal growth conditions.
This distribution was augmented by the addition of ATO,
as previously reported [14]. Similarly, stimulation with
Ang II further increased both the number and size of
PML-NBs in cultured NMCMs (Figure 2D).

the decreased HERG protein expression caused by ATO
(Figure 3C) and Ang II (Figure 3D). UBC9, a unique
E2-like conjugating enzyme, is essential for conjugation
of PML with SUMO [16], and transfection with siRNA
against UBC9 significantly decreased the SUMOylated
PML and global SUMO expression triggered by ATO
(Figure 3E) or Ang II (Figure 3F). NMCMs that showed
diminished UBC9 levels were found to have significantly
less HERG protein degradation than cells exposed to ATO
(Figure 3G) or Ang II (Figure 3H).
In order to regain PML SUMOylation, RNF4, a
RING-finger ubiquitin ligase implicated in arsenic-induced
PML degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome [11], was
knocked down in NMCMs. Bands were observed via
immunoblotting that were consistent with SUMOylated
PML after ATO and Ang II treatment and RNF4 depletion
caused a shift in endogenous SUMO conjugates that were
consistent with global SUMO expression (Figure 4A, 4B).
Less HERG protein expression was noted in NMCMs
subjected to RNF4 silencing than in those exposed to ATO
(Figure 4C) or Ang II (Figure 4D).

PML SUMOylation decreased HERG protein
expression

PML increased expression of TGF-β1 in a Pin1dependent way

In order to assess the inhibitory effect of PML
SUMOylation on HERG protein expression, the
SUMOylation chemical inhibitor ginkgolic acid (GA)
was used to interfere with PML SUMOylation [15].
Immunoblot analysis indicated that GA treatment partially
abolished PML SUMOylation that was induced by ATO
(Figure 3A) or Ang II (Figure 3B), consequently reversing

PML-NBs have been implicated in a variety of
biological processes via mechanisms regulating the
functions, activities, and localization of PML-NBs binding
partners, including Pin1 [17]. Importantly, recent evidence

indicates that Pin1 controls TGF-β1 mRNA stability in
multiple organs [18]. Co-immunoprecipitation studies
detecting the PML/Pin1 complex in cultured NMCMs
were performed using lysates immunoprecipitated with
either anti-PML or anti-Pin1 antibodies (Figure 5A).
Double immunofluorescence analysis was conducted to
visualize PML-NBs morphology and the interaction with
Pin1 under normal conditions (Figure 5B). A small fraction
of complexes that contained PML and Pin1 was observed
in the presence of ATO or Ang II, while UBC9 knockdown
dramatically reduced the number of PML-NBs, as well as
sequestering Pin1 into these structures. In RNF4-silenced
cells, PML-NBs were augmented with numerous PML
foci, leading to a dramatic increase in the co-localization
of PML with Pin1 (Figure 5C).
Changes in TGF-β1 levels were assessed after
intervention with PML SUMOylation and the suppression

of PML SUMOylation by UBC9 knockdown failed
to recruit Pin1. This can be attributed to reductions in
TGF-β1 upregulation induced by ATO (Figure 5D) or
Ang II (Figure 5E). In contrast, RNF4 silencing resulted
in TGF-β1 expression that was higher than in NMCMs
treated with ATO (Figure 5F) and Ang II (Figure 5G).

TGF-β1 suppressed HERG protein expression
through PKA activation in NMCMs
Previous research has demonstrated that increases
in protein kinase A (PKA) activity significantly inhibited
HERG protein expression [7, 19]. Cultured NMCMs were
treated with antagonists of PKA-H89 and activators of
PKA-forskolin to confirm the role of PKA in TGF-β1mediated HERG expression. Stimulation with TGF-β1
(5 ng/mL) for 24 h visibly reduced HERG abundance,

while downregulation was prevented by treatment with 10
mM PKA antagonist H89 (Figure 6A). TGF-β1 stimulation
increased PKA activity and supplementation with 10 μM
forskolin yielded similar results (Figure 6B). Together,
these observations suggest a role for PKA activity in TGFβ1-suppressed HERG abundance.

translocation of Pin1 into PML-NBs led to upregulation of
TGF-β1, eventually inhibiting HERG expression through
PKA activation (Figure 7).
SUMOylation is an enzymatic reaction that includes
SUMO activation and requires E1 activating enzyme,
SUMO conjugation to the -targeting substrate by UBC9,
and modification by several E3 protein ligases. Modulation
of these steps, such as by regulatory molecules, controls
the SUMO pathway, and Fukuda et al. reported that GA,
a small molecular inhibitor, significantly impairs protein
SUMOylation by inhibiting formation of the E1-SUMO
complex [15]. PML-NBs biogenesis and SUMOylation
are also regulated via cooperation between PML, UBC9
and RNF4 [20]. Nacerddine et al. had observed that
UBC9-deficient mice had abrogated SUMO pathways
and exhibited severe defects in PML-NBs organization,
eventually leading to decreased embryonic viability [21].

DISCUSSION
In the present study, the effects of PML SUMOylation
and associated NBs on HERG protein expression, as
well as the mechanisms that underlie its action, were
investigated in cultured NMCMs. Primarily, it was found
that: (1) exposure of cells to ATO and Ang II significantly
reduced the expression of HERG protein; (2) both ATO
and Ang II stimulation increased PML SUMOylation and
NBs aggregation, promoting recruitment with Pin1; (3)

Significantly, mice deficient in UBC9 fail to form normal
PML-NBs and PML remains unmodified by SUMOs [22].
Among SUMO-regulated processes, RNF4 represents a
subclass of ubiquitin ligases that target proteins modified
by the SUMO for ubiquitin-mediated degradation [23].
PML is characteristic of most substrates degraded in
this way. RNF4 targets poly-SUMO-modified PML for
degradation through a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
Michael et al. showed that RNF4 depletion could lead to
accumulation of poly-SUMO chains and PML protein [24].
In the present study, RNF4 knockdown further decreased
ATO- or Ang- II-induced HERG channel degradation due
to PML accumulation, independent of its E3 ligase activity.
Guo et al. reported that another E3 ubiquitin ligase,
Nedd4-2, ubiquitinates and eliminates mature HERG
channels [25]. Cav3 decreases the expression of HERG via
recruiting Nedd4-2 from the cytosol to the membrane and
prevents its interaction with mature HERG channels [26].

A variety of stresses can alter the entire SUMO
conjugation pathway, as well as the morphogenesis
and partner recruitment of PML-NBs. These include
heavy metals, interferon, and viruses, while arsenic very
specifically regulates PML SUMOylation. Herein, the
dynamic changes in PML-NBs after Ang II treatment were
analogous to previous reports of NBs formation induced by
interferon, which boosts PML expression [27]. As both the
number and size of PML-NBs were dramatically increased,
it is likely that pre-existing PML may be recruited into NBs
after Ang II exposure. PML-NBs are composed of a striking
variety of associated proteins, and PML-NBs can affect
many different cellular functions by activation, inhibition,
or localization of interaction partners [17]. Chapman et al.
confirmed that ceramide-induced modification of HERG
currents and an associated rapid decline in HERG protein
can be caused by protein ubiquitinylation and subsequent
lysosomal degradation [3]. A more complete understanding

of the other molecular components involved in PMLmediated HERG expression is necessary to determine the
biological function and biomedical significance of HERG.
The effect of TGF-β1 treatment on regulation of
the PKA activity may differ in different cell types. For
example, Zhang et al. suggested that TGF-β1 upregulates
Kv2.1 channel expression and IKr currents without

affecting the activity of PKA in rat primary cerebellar
granule neurons [28]. However, a previous study showed
that incubation of TGF-β1 for 15 min induces PKA activity
in rat mesangial cells and mink lung epithelial cells [29].
Giannouli et al. have demonstrated that TGF-β inhibits the
proliferation of fetal skin fibroblasts by the activation of
PKA [30]. In our study, we showed that TGF-β1 (5 ng/mL)

for 24 h increased PKA activity and significantly reduced
HERG abundance in NMCMs.
It has recently been demonstrated that the HERG
potassium channel is regulated by PKA in Xenopus
oocytes, in a CHO cell line, and in isolated guinea-pig
ventricular myocytes. Activation of the β-adrenergic
system and subsequent elevation of the intracellular
concentration of the second messenger, cAMP regulates
HERG channels. Previous studies have suggested that
adrenergic signal transduction exerts distinct inhibitory

effects on cardiac HERG/IKr currents either through PKAmediated phosphorylation of the channel protein or via
direct interaction with the cAMP binding site of HERG
[30, 31]. Shu et al. demonstrated that exposure of cells to
PKA activators for 10 h significantly impaired HERG K+
channel function and reduced HERG K+ current density via
generation of ROS [19, 31]. Controversially, Chen et al. also
demonstrated that isoproterenol administration increased
HERG abundance in HEK-293 cells co-transfected
with HERG and β-adrenergic receptor. This study also

demonstrated that elevated PKA activity via forskolin at
10 μM produced a sustained increase in the abundance of
HERG channel protein in stably transfected HEK-293 cells
[32]. Another study explained this by showing that TGF-β
stimulates PKA activity independent the intracellular cAMP
levels in murine mesangial cells [29]. β-adrenergic receptor
or forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator, both increase
PKA activity through the elevation of intracellular levels
of cAMP. Thus, activation of PKA by different signals
may have pleiotropy effects on HERG channel expression.
It can be concluded that TGF-β reduced HERG channel
expression through PKA activation, possibly independent
of the cAMP levels.
PML proteins have received much attention due
to their pluripotent biochemical and physiological
involvements in cancer, the immune system, and
inflammatory conditions. However, the function of PML
in cardiovascular disorders has only recently begun to be
elucidated. This is the first study to identify an effect of
PML SUMOylation on the HERG protein and provides
a basis for the regulatory roles of PML SUMOylation
in HERG expression, as well as a potential strategy for
treating and preventing HERG-associated cardiotoxicity.

was supplemented at 100 nM and ATO (Harbin YI-DA
Pharmaceutical Company; China) was supplemented
at 2 μM for the indicated times. siRNA was purchased
from GenePharma (Shanghai, China) with the following
sequences (Table 1).
Transfections were performed using X-treme GENE
siRNA transfection reagent (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, U.S.)
in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. Samples
were analyzed after 36 or 48 h of transfection and all
results were compared to transfections with a nontargeting siRNA. NMCMs were washed once with sterile
PBS and then starved with serum-free medium for 4–6 h.
The siRNA and X-treme were separately diluted with
250  μL of Opti-MEM reduced serum medium (Gibco,
Grand Island, NY, U.S.) for 5 min, then mixed together
and incubated for 20 min. The mixture was added to cells
and cultured at 37°C. After incubation for 4–6 h, fresh
culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum was replaced with fresh culture medium and the
cells were cultured at 37°C for further treatment.

Cell
survival
was
examined
by
the
3-[4,5-dimethylthylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, U.S.). Cells
were seeded onto 96-well flask. At specific points in time,
MTT was added to each well, and the cells were then
incubated at 37°C for 4 h. DMSO was then added to each
well. A microplate reader was used to measure the optical
density (OD) value at 490 nm after shaking for 10 min.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Primary culture of neonatal mouse
cardiomyocytes (NMCMs)
This investigation was approved by the Animal
Experiments Committee of the Harbin Medical University
and conformed with the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals published by the United States
National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23,
revised 1985). NMCMs were obtained from 1–2-day-old
Kunming neonatal mice as described previously. In detail,
the ventricle tissues of the neonatal mice were finely
minced and subjected to enzymatic digestion with 0.25%
trypsin (Beyotime Biotechnology; China) and mechanical
dissociation. Suspensions were harvested and seeded into
6-well culture plates. Non-myocytes were discarded based
on different adhesion time between cell types, leaving
NMCMs attached at a final density of 106 cells/well in
DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone,
Logan, UT, U.S.), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL
streptomycin (Beyotime Biotechnology; China). BrdU
(5-bromo-20-deoxyuridine) was added into the culture
medium to prevent the growth of non-myocytes.

Immunoblot analysis
Total protein was extracted from cells as previously
described. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Beyotime
Biotechnology; China) containing 1% protease inhibitors
(Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) or 20 mM
N-ethylmaleimide as appropriate (Sigma-Aldrich; St.
Louis, MO, U.S.). The lysates were separated on an 8% or
12% SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred to nitrocellulose
filter membranes. After being blocked in 5% non-fat
milk, the membranes were incubated with the following
primary antibodies: anti-PML (1:500 dilution; MBL,
Nagoya, Japan), SUMO-1 (1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, U.S.), SUMO-2/3 (1:500
dilution; Abcam, Cambridge, U.K.), UBC9 (1:500 dilution;
Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, U.S.); RNF4
(1:500 dilution; Abcam, Cambridge, U.K.); anti-TGF-β1
(1:500 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA,
U.S.) and anti-HERG (1:500 dilution; Alomone labs,
Jerusalem, Israel). GAPDH (1:10,000 dilution; Research
Diagnostics, Concord, MA, U.S.). Goat anti-rabbit
(1:10,000 dilution; Alexa Fluor 700 conjugated; Molecular
Probes/Life Technologies) served as the secondary
antibody. Immunoblots were imaged using an LI-CORE

Cell transfection and treatment
siRNA silencing and cell treatments were performed
as described previously. After 72 h of incubation, the
NMCM medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM
overnight before treatment with different reagents.

and Odyssey software was used for quantification of bands
normalized to GAPDH.

processed using the Image-Pro Plus6.0 software program.
PML was quantified by counting 100 cells per sample, and
experiments were performed in triplicate.

Co-immunoprecipitation

Protein kinase A (PKA) activity assay

Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Beyotime
Biotechnology; China) and 500 μg of protein was
quantified after concentration measurement using a BCA
kit (Beyotime Biotechnology; China). Primary antibodies
against PML (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA,
U.S.) and Pin1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA, U.S.) were incubated with the protein samples at 4°C
overnight on a shaker. Protein A/G agarose beads were
added to the samples and allowed to incubate at 4°C for
8 h. After centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min, the beads
were gently collected and rinsed five times with TBST.
The samples were denatured in loading buffer and the
purified proteins were then analyzed using antibodies
specific for PML (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA, U.S.), SUMO-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA, U.S.), SUMO-2/3 (Abcam, Cambridge, U.K.)
or Pin1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, U.S.)
by SDS-PAGE.

PKA activity was assessed using a ProFluor PKA
Assay, as described previously (Promega, Madison,
WI, U.S.) [7]. Briefly, NMCMs were treated with either
TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) or forskolin (10 μM) for 24 h. The
cells were washed then with PBS and lysed in ice-cold
lysis buffer. Equal amounts of the quantified lysates were
mixed with the reaction mixture. Then the kinase dilution
solution, diluted PKA, and ATP solution were added to
each well. The mixture was incubated at room temperature
for 20 min, followed by adding protease solution and
incubation for another 30 min. Finally, stabilizer solution
was added to each sample. Data was collected using
an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission
wavelength of 530 nm.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with Prism 5
(GraphPad Software, Inc.). Data are expressed as mean ±
SEM. Significant differences between mean values were
evaluated with the Student’s t-test for comparison between
2 groups. Multiple comparisons were performed using oneway ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc tests. For more than 2
groups, 2-way ANOVA was performed. A P value < 0.05
was considered to be statistically significant.

Immunofluorescence
Cells were plated on coverslips, washed in PBS,
and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at
room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were
permeabilized for 1 h with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS.
Next, cells were washed with PBS and blocked in 30%
normal goat serum for 1 h at 37°C. Cells were incubated
overnight with antibodies against mouse PML (1:100;
MBL, Nagoya, Japan) or Pin1 (1:100; Thermo Scientific,
Hudson, NH, U.S.). After three washes with PBS, cells
were stained with FITC-488- or Alexa-595-conjugated
secondary antibodies (1:500; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
U.S.) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, cells were
stained with DAPI (1:50; Beyotime Biotechnology;
China) and fluorescence signals were detected using the
60× oil objective on a confocal fluorescence microscope
(Olympus, Hamburg, Germany). Images were obtained and
