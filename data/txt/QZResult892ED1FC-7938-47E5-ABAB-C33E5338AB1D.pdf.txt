ABSTRACT
Circulating Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA is a biomarker of EBV-associated
malignancies. Its prognostic value in early stage NK/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL) in
the era of asparaginase was investigated. 68 patients were treated with a median
of 4 cycles of asparaginase-based chemotherapy followed by a median of 54.6Gy
(range 50–60Gy) radiation. The amount of EBV-DNA was prospectively measured
in both pretreatment and post-treatment plasma samples by real-time quantitative
PCR. At the end of treatment, complete response (CR) rate was 79.4%, and overall
response rate (ORR) was 88.2%. Patients with negative pretreatment EBV-DNA
had a higher CR rate (96.0% vs. 69.8%, p = 0.023). The 3-year progression-free
survival (PFS) rate and overall survival (OS) rate was 71% and 83%, respectively.
In multivariate survival analysis, post-treatment EBV-DNA positivity and treatment
response (non-CR) were prognostic factors for both worse PFS and OS (p < 0.05).
Local tumor invasion was also a prognostic factor for worse OS (p = 0.010). In
patients with CR, post-treatment EBV-DNA positivity correlated with inferior PFS
and OS (both p < 0.0001). In patients with positive pretreatment EBV-DNA, negative
post-treatment EBV-DNA correlated with better PFS and OS (both p < 0.0001). These
findings indicate that post-treatment EBV-DNA positivity can predict early relapse and
poor prognosis for patients with early stage NKTCL in the era of asparaginase, and
may be used as an indicator of minimal residual disease.

South America [2]. In recent years, many cancer centers
have adopted the combination of chemotherapy and
radiotherapy (RT) (primary chemotherapy followed by RT
or concurrent chemoradiotherapy) for localized disease to
reduce the relapse rate [3–5]. Due to overexpression of
multi-drug resistance (MDR) gene in NKTCL cells [6],
anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens are no longer
the standard of care for NKTCL, and with increasing

INTRODUCTION
Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (NKTCL) is a
distinct subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and
closely associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection
[1]. This disease is relatively rare in the United States
and Europe but much more common in EBV-endemic
areas, such as East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Central and

evidence asparaginase-based regimens are now frontline
treatments [5, 7–9].
Circulating cell-free EBV DNA can be detected
in plasma from patients with EBV-associated neoplasm
[10–12]. Lei et al. [13] demonstrated a close correlation
in NKTCL patients between clinical outcomes and
plasma EBV-DNA levels (N = 18). Recently, Wang et al.
[14] explored the prognostic value of plasma EBV-DNA
levels in a relatively homogenous cohort of patients with
early-stage NKTCL who received primary radiotherapy
(N = 69) and found that both the pretreatment and
post-treatment EBV-DNA level can serve as a valuable
biomarker of tumor load and prognostic factors.
However, all patients in the study reported by Wang
et al. [14] received upfront radiotherapy, and half the
patients received CHOP or CHOP-like chemotherapy
regimens, which are now considered inappropriate for
NKTCL patients [15]. Thus, in the era of asparaginase,
whether plasma EBV-DNA levels can still retain their
prognostic value or not remains to be investigated. Kwong
et al. [16] investigated the role of EBV-DNA in patients
treated with SMILE (dexamethasone, methotrexate,
ifosfamide, L-asparaginase and etoposide), and found that
post-treatment EBV-DNA levels are a prognostic factor
for overall survival (OS). However, the toxicities related
with SMILE treatment are severe [8] and rarely used in
China. Wang et al. [5] and Lin et al. [4] demonstrated
that GELOX (gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and asparaginase)
and CHOPL (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine,
prednisone, and asparaginase) were well tolerated and had
great activity in the treatment of early stage NKTCL.
In this prospective observational study, we explored
the correlation between plasma EBV-DNA levels and
clinical features (such as response rate and survival)
in early-stage NKTCL patients treated with upfront
asparaginase-based chemotherapy (GELOX or CHOPL)
followed by radiotherapy.

(27.9% vs.12.0%), B symptoms (51.2% vs. 28.0%),
ECOG performance status score >1 (27.9% vs. 16.0%),
and higher IPI score (20.9% vs. 8.0%), but all differences
were not significant.

Treatment response and post-treatment
EBV-DNA level
All patients received a median of 4 cycles
(range 2–6) of asparaginase-based chemotherapy followed
by a median of 54.6Gy (range 50–60Gy) RT. At the end
of treatment, 54 patients (79.4%) got complete response
(CR), 6 patients (8.8%) got partial response (PR), resulting
in an overall response rate (ORR) of 88.2%. As is shown
in Table 1, patients with negative pretreatment EBV-DNA
had significantly higher CR rate (96.0% vs. 69.8%,
p = 0.023). Post-treatment EBV-DNA was positive in
15 patients (22.1%), of whom the treatment response was
evaluated as CR in 10 patients (66.7%), PR in 1 patient
(6.7%), and disease progression (PD) in the remaining
4 patients (26.7%).

Long-term survival outcomes and
survival analysis
At a median follow-up time of 32 months
(range 2–76), 17 patients had disease progression or
relapse at a median of 5.3 months (1–28.3), of whom
10 patients died of tumor progression at a median of
9 months (3.4–25.2). The 3-year progression-free survival
(PFS) rate and overall survival (OS) rate was 71% and
83%, respectively.
As is demonstrated in Figure 1 and Table 2, in
univariate survival analysis, stage (II), pretreatment
EBV-DNA level (positive), post-treatment EBV-DNA
level (positive), and treatment response (non-CR)
significantly correlated with both inferior PFS and OS
( p < 0.05), while ECOG PS score (>1) was associated
with poor PFS (p = 0.025) and local tumor invasion was
associated with poor OS (p = 0.022). In multivariate
survival analysis that including all parameters found to
be significant in univariate analysis, it was found that
post-treatment EBV-DNA level (positive) and treatment
response (non-CR) were significantly prognostic factors
for both worse PFS and OS ( p < 0.05), and local tumor
invasion was also a significantly prognostic factor for
worse OS ( p = 0.010).
In subgroup analysis, of the 54 patients who got CR,
post-treatment EBV-DNA level was positive in 10 patients,
and these patients had significantly inferior PFS and OS
than those with negative post-treatment EBV-DNA level
(both p < 0.0001) (Figure 2-A, 2-C). Of 14 patients who did
not get CR, post-treatment EBV-DNA level was negative in
10 patients, and these patients had significantly better PFS
than those with positive post-treatment EBV-DNA level
( p = 0.003) (Figure 2-B, 2-D). Of the 43 patients who

had higher levels of tumor load, such as elevated LDH
level, B symptoms and higher IPI scores, however, all
these differences were not significant. The discrepancies
between our result and previous results may be influenced
by the following factors: (1) only early stage patients
were included in our study and differences in tumor
load were sometimes not obvious between stage I and II
disease; (2) in this study, we chose 0 copy/mL as the cutoff
value for the pretreatment EBV-DNA level, and we used
chi-square analysis for the correlation between EBV-DNA
levels and clinical features. In contrast, most previous
studies [14, 16] used Mann-Whitney tests to compare
the median level of EBV-DNA between different groups.
These different methods may contribute to the different
results; (3) small sample sizes, including our study. Thus,
large cohort studies or meta-analysis should be performed
to validate these results.
In recent years, studies find that high expression
of MDR gene in NKTCL cells may lead to primary
resistance to anthracyclines-based chemotherapy [6] and
that asparaginase-based regimens have an impressive

DISCUSSION
In this study of NKTCL patients treated with
an asparaginase-based method, we confirmed that
pretreatment EBV-DNA levels correlated with a decreased
treatment response, and post-treatment EBV-DNA levels
were a prognostic factor for both PFS and OS. Moreover,
we proposed that post-treatment EBV-DNA levels could
be used as a biomarker of minimal residual disease (MRD)
for NKTCL.
The lymphomagenesis of NKTCL is closely
associated with EBV infection [1, 17]. Previous studies
found that pretreatment EBV-DNA levels can reflect the
tumor load [13, 14, 18]. In our study, it appeared that

response rate in NKTCL patients [4, 5, 7, 8]. In this
study, after asparaginase-based chemotherapy followed
by RT, the 3-year PFS and OS rate was 71% and 83%,
respectively, which seems better than our retrospective
results of CHOP followed by RT (3-year PFS and OS
rate was 43% and 54%, respectively) [7, 15] This finding
needs to be validated in prospective randomized clinical
trials. However, no biomarkers are defined yet to predict
the response rate of asparaginase-based treatment. In our
study, patients with positive pretreatment EBV-DNA had a
lower CR rate. Similarly, Kwong et al. [16] demonstrated
that higher levels of pretreatment EBV-DNA predicted
poor response rates after chemotherapy with SMILE
regimen, indicating that the pretreatment EBV-DNA level
may be a good candidate for the prediction of response
after asparaginase-based treatment. If validated in future
perspective clinical trials, patients with high pretreatment
EBV-DNA levels may benefit from more intensive
treatments or novel drugs other than asparaginase-based
therapy.
Most previous studies searched for valuable
prognostic factors in NKTCL patients [15, 17, 19–26].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

IPI, Korean prognostic score (KPI), local tumor invasion,
and treatment response were confirmed by different
studies as independent prognostic factors in the era of
pre-asparaginase. Whether these factors remain to be of
value requires further investigation Kwong et al. [16]
found that in patients treated with SMILE chemotherapy,
both IPI and KPI lost their prognostic values when
the EBV-DNA level was included in the final Cox
regression model. Similar work was published when
our paper was submitted for publication [27], finding
that post-treatment EBV-DNA positivity correlates with
PFS and OS in patients with NKTCL. In our present
study, most elements of IPI and KPI (such as age,
stage, LDH level, B symptoms, ECOG performance
status) were found to be uncorrelated with prognosis,
indicating the poor prognosis brought by these factors
might be overcome by asparaginase-based therapy. Our
study also found that pretreatment EBV-DNA levels
were not an independent prognostic factor for both
PFS and OS and that the final treatment response was
much more valuable in predicting the prognosis. This is
consistent with the results of a previous study [16] where

presentation EBV DNA levels did not have an impact on
survival independently, implying that the sensitivity of
the tumor to asparaginase-based therapy, rather than its
load, might be a more important indicator of survival.
Most importantly, post-treatment EBV-DNA positivity
was the most valuable independent prognostic factor for
PFS and OS in patients treated with asparaginase-based
therapy and this result was similar with previous studies
[14, 16, 18]. Post-treatment EBV-DNA positivity
may indicate MRD, which has been widely used as a
prognostic factor for various hematologic malignancies.
In most patients, a positive MRD may reflect less
sensitivity to asparaginase-based therapy and an increase
in disease relapse.. In patients who had CR with positive
post-treatment EBV-DNA levels, their PFS was shorter

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

than those with a negative EBV-DNA level. Furthermore,
some patients did not have CR after treatment, however
they also had negative post-treatment EBV-DNA levels,
possibly indicating an indolent nature of these patients,
and their PFS was relatively better. Finally, for patients
with high levels of pretreatment EBV-DNA, a negative
post-treatment EBV-DNA level indicates quick tumor
reduction. This implies that the disease was highly
sensitive to asparaginase-based therapy, thus bestowing
these patients with superior treatment outcomes.
In conclusion, we find that post-treatment
EBV-DNA positivity in plasma can predict early relapse
and poor prognosis for patients with early stage NKTCL
in the era of asparaginase, and may be used as an indicator
of minimal residual disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

For patients who had stage IIE disease, the clinical target
volume also included the bilateral cervical lymph node
area. Tumor response was assessed after every 2 cycles
of chemotherapy or before and after RT on the basis
of standardized response criteria for non-Hodgkin
lymphoma [29].

Patients
Between January 2008 to December 2014,
68 patients diagnosed as stage IE/IIE NKTCL in Sun
Yat-sen University Cancer Center were included in
this study. The pretreatment and post-treatment plasma
samples were prospectively collected. This study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Sun
Yat-sen University Cancer Center. All patients provided
written informed consent for the collection and publication
of their medical information at the first visit to our center.
The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: (1)
confirmed diagnosis of NKTCL according to the World
Health Organization (WHO) classification for lymphomas
[28], and in situ hybridization for EBV encoded RNA
(EBER) should be positive for all patients; (2) primary
tumor site located in the upper aerodigestive tract; (3)
stage IE and IIE disease; (4) complete clinical information
and follow-up data; (5) no prior therapy for NKTCL.
All patients received upfront asparaginase-based
chemotherapy, such as CHOPL [4] and GELOX
[5]. After a median of 4 cycles (range 2–6) of
chemotherapy, patients were given a median of 54.6Gy
(range 50–60Gy) RT using intensity-modulated
radiotherapy (IMRT) or three dimension conformal
radiotherapy [5]. We defined the clinical target volume
of limited stage IE disease as the bilateral nasal cavity,
bilateral ethmoid sinuses, and ipsilateral maxillary sinus;
and the clinical target volume extended to involved
tissues for patients who had extensive stage IE disease.

Patient samples and DNA preparation
Plasma samples were collected from patients within
one week before initiation of chemotherapy and one
month after completion of RT. All plasma samples were
frozen at -80°C before further processing. Total plasma
cell-free DNA was isolated using the QIAamp Blood Mini
Kit (QIAgen, Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) acc ording to the
“blood and body fluid protocol” as recommended by the
manufacturer.

EBV-DNA quantification
The real-time quantitative PCR system was
developed for plasma EBV DNA detection toward
the BamHI-W region as previously reported [30, 31].
The system consisted of the amplification primers W-44F
(5′-AGT CTC TGC CTC AGG GCA-3′) and W-119R
(5′-ACA GAG GGC CTG TCC ACCG-3′) and the
dual-labeled fluorescent probe W-67T (5′-[FAM]CAC
TGT CTG TAA AGT CCA GCC TCC[TAMRA]-3′).
EBV-negative healthy volunteers were used as negative
controls, and a no template control was run on each plate
as a blank control. The results were expressed asthe
number of copies of EBV per milliliter (mL) of plasma.

The correlation between pretreatment EBV-DNA
levels and clinical features was analyzed using the
Mann-Whitney test. The comparison of qualitative data was
performed using the chi-square analysis. According to the
method we used for EBV-DNA quantification, the detection
limit was defined to be 1000 copies/mL (any level between
0–1000 copies/mL was positive, but the value was not
accurate), thus we chose 0 copy/mL as the cutoff value
for both pretreatment and post-treatment EBV-DNA level.
Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated from the
date of diagnosis to the date of disease progression or
death and was censored at the date of the last follow-up
visit. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the date
of diagnosis to the date of death from any cause and was
censored at the date of the last follow-up visit. Survival
analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method,
and comparisons were calculated using the log-rank test.
Multivariate analysis was used to estimate the prognostic
impact of different variables in OS and PFS using the
Cox regression model. Differences between the results
from comparative tests were considered significant if the
two-sided p value was <0.05. All statistical analyses were
performed using PASW Statistics 18.0 software (Apache
Software Foundation, Forest Hill, Md).
