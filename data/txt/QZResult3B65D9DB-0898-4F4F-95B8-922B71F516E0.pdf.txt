ABSTRACT
The activation of apoptotic pathways results in the caspase cleavage of the Lyn
tyrosine kinase to generate the N-terminal truncated LynΔN. This LynΔN fragment
has been demonstrated to exert negative feedback on imatinib induced apoptosis in
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) K562 cells. Our investigations focus on LynΔN
stability and how reduced stability reduces imatinib resistance. As the proteolytical
generated LynΔN has a leucine as an N-terminal amino acid, we hypothesized that
LynΔN would be degraded by the N-end rule pathway. We demonstrated that LynΔN
is unstable and that its stability is dependent on the identity of its N-terminus.
Additionally we established that LynΔN degradation could be inhibited by either
inhibiting the proteasome or knocking down the UBR1 and UBR2 ubiquitin E3 ligases.
Importantly, we also demonstrate that LynΔN degradation by the N-end rule counters
the imatinib resistance of K562 cells provided by LynΔN expression. Together our data
suggest a possible mechanism for the N-end rule pathway having a link to imatinib
resistance in CML. With LynΔN being an N-end rule substrate, it provides the first
example that this pathway can also provide a pro-apoptotic function as previous
reports have currently only demonstrated anti-apoptotic roles for the N-end rule
pathway.

INTRODUCTION

the Bcr-Abl fusion protein for the treatment of chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML), has greatly improved the
control of CML a significant number of patient eventually
develop imatinib resistance[8]. While the most common
resistance mechanism is the sporadic mutations to BcrAbl other mechanisms occurring at significant frequency
include the overexpression of Src family kinases like
Lyn[9, 10].
During apoptosis in B cells, T cells and the CML cell
line K562, Lyn is cleaved in its N-terminal SH4 domain
by caspase-3 after aspartate 18, exposing a leucine as the
new N-termini[11-13]. This cleavage shown schematically
in Figure 1, was demonstrated to result in almost full
length Lyn bearing an N-terminal leucine, but lacking
the short N-terminal region containing the acylation sites
necessary to maintain the association of Lyn to the plasma
membrane. As a result, Lyn is free to diffuse from the
plasma membrane into the cytosol of the cells [13]. The

Lyn is a member of the Src family of tyrosine
kinases (SFKs) that is a pivotal signalling intermediary
for signal transduction pathways involved in a broad
range of cellular functions such as proliferation[1, 2],
differentiation[3] , cell migration[4], autophagy[5] and
apoptosis[6]. The structure of the Lyn protein includes:
(i) a unique N-terminal domain (SH4) that contains a
myristoylation site and a palmitoylation site[7] required
for membrane attachment, followed by (ii) two proteinprotein interaction domains initially characterized in
SFKs (SRC homology 2 and 3 domains, SH2 and SH3
respectively), and (iii) a kinase domain containing its
catalytic activity.
The expression of Lyn has also been linked to cancer
progression and drug resistance. While the development of
imatinib (Gleevac), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting

caspase-cleaved form of Lyn (LynΔN) was shown to exert
an anti-apoptotic function in B-cells and K562 cells[11,
12]. In the case of the K562 cells, it was also demonstrated
that LynΔN provided a significantly increased resistance in
comparison to the full length un-cleaved Lyn protein[11].
Additional investigation in mouse models have revealed
that the expression of LynΔN results in a psoriasis-like
inflammatory syndrome and impair TFNR1 signalling[14,
15].
The N-end rule relates the in vivo half-life of
a protein to the identity of its N-terminal amino acid
residue[16, 17]. The components of the N-end rule
pathway recognize proteins with specific N-termini and
target these proteins for ubiquitin dependent degradation
by 26 S proteasome. Similar but distinct versions of the
N-end rule are present in all organisms from mammals
to bacteria. In eukaryotes, N-end rule pathway mediated
protein degradation has been implicated in diverse
biological processes such as: G-protein signalling[18],
DNA repair[19], cardiovascular development[20] and
apoptosis[21].
The activity of the N-end rule pathway has been
linked to the regulation of programmed cell death via the
targeted degradation of proteolytic products that promote
or carry out apoptosis [21-24]. In D. melanogaster it was
demonstrated that the Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis
protein (DIAP1), which binds and inhibits active caspases,
is cleaved by an active caspase. Caspase cleavage
exposes an N-terminal asparagine which is an N-end
rule destabilizing residue[21]. As a result, the N-end rule
degradation machinery targets DIAP1, and potentially
the active caspase, for degradation via the proteasome.
More recent investigations with mammalian cells have
shown that the N-end rule pathway targets a variety of
pro-apoptotic protein fragments, generated as a result
of proteolysis by active proteases during apoptosis, for
degradation[23-25]. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that
the partial ablation of the N-end rule pathway sensitizes
mouse embryonic fibroblasts to apoptosis-inducing agents.
Together, these results suggest a significant role for the
N-end rule pathway on the suppression of the apoptotic
program.
Here we investigate the role of N-end rule-mediated
degradation of LynΔN, a caspase generated protein that
counters cell death[11, 12]. We present the first study on

the stability of LynΔN and demonstrate that the N-terminal
leucine of LynΔN targets it for degradation via the N-End
rule pathway. With the exception of pathogen induced
cell death[26], this is the first example of the N-End
rule functioning in a pro-apoptotic role by the targeted
degradation of an anti-apoptotic protein.

RESULTS AND DISCUSION
The proteolytic cleavage of Lyn by caspase-3
after aspartate 18 sheds the N-terminal segment of the
protein that contains both the sites of N-myristoylation
and S-palmitoylation[13]. The proteolytic release of the
Lyn fragment has also been demonstrated to counter
the apoptotic program and significantly increases the
resistance of Ramos cells to IgM stimulation[12] and
K562 cells to imatinib[11]. Figure 1a shows the Western
blot analysis after expressing a Lyn-GFP construct
in K562 cells, a CML derived cell line, treated with
imatinib. Imatinib treatments results in the appearance
of a faster migrating species that corresponds to the
cleaved Lyn protein. Cleavage of Lyn is concomitant with
PARP cleavage, which is commonly utilized to detect
caspase activity[27]. The increased apparent amount of
LynΔN over that of the full-length Lyn observed in the
blot is attributed to poorer extraction of the full-length
myristoylated and palmitoylated Lyn protein from the
membrane insoluble fraction of the lysis buffer. The
loss of the N-terminal domain of LynΔN with the fatty
acid modifications results in the diffusion of LynΔN
throughout the cytoplasm[12]. To date there has been no

investigations into the stability of LynΔN.
We utilized an expression system to investigate the
stability and cellular effects of LynΔN that is independent
of caspase cleavage. This was to circumvent the challenges
of having ongoing formation of the cleaved protein
during investigations of protein stability, as the continued
cleavage by caspase-3 would convolute the analysis. To
mimic the caspase-cleaved form of the Lyn kinase, a
plasmid construct was created to express a recombinant
ubiquitin-LynΔN fusion protein with a C-terminal 3×
FLAG tag as we have previously described[24]. The
ubiquitin-fusion technique enables the expression of
a protein with any desired N-terminal amino acid as
the N-terminal ubiquitin is proteolytically removed by
endogenous ubiquitin hydrolases, which releases LynΔN
as generated by caspase-3 cleavage of the full length
Lyn[13] (Figure 1b). This approach enables the expression
of LynΔN with leucine as the N-terminal amino acid.
The N-terminal leucine of LynΔN renders it a

potential N-End Rule substrate, as leucine is a type II
primary destabilizing N-terminus[16]. To investigate this
possibility we evaluated whether LynΔN was degraded
and whether degradation was dependent on the identity
of the N-termini. A mutation to the ubiquitin-LynΔN
fusion was made to change the N-terminal leucine of
Lyn to valine, methionine and arginine, as valine and
methionine are stabilizing N-termini and arginine is a
type I destabilizing N-terminus[16]. To investigate protein
stability, the LynΔN constructs were transiently transfected
into HEK293T. Twenty four hours following transfection,
cells were treated with 100 µg/ml of cycloheximide
(CHX) to inhibit protein synthesis and the cells were
then lysed at increasing time points after CHX addition.
Lysates were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and the
amount of LynΔN remaining was quantified by Western
blot analysis with an anti-FLAG antibody using actin as a
loading control. The data reveals that LynΔN with the wild
type leucine N-termini is unstable (Figure 2a). In contrast,

After transfection the cells were treated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) to block protein synthesis. At the indicated time points,
cells were lysed and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The amount of LynΔN protein remaining was visualized by WB analysis with an antiFLAG M2 antibody Loading control analysis was done by WB analysis using an anti-actin antibody. (b) LynΔN with N-terminal arginine
(type I destabilizing N-termini) and methionine (stable N-termini) were transfected into HEK293T and analyzed as in (a). (c) Stability of

DNA was used for each transfection was kept constant. (e) Knock down of UBR1 after shRNA treatment in (d) was verified by WB analysis

the N-terminal valine mutant (Figure 2a) and methionine
mutant (Figure 2b) are stable. As predicted the mutant
with the N-terminal arginine is rapidly degraded (Figure
2b), as protein is only observed at the initial time point.
This N-terminal dependent degradation of Lyn suggests
that LynΔN may be a bona fide N-end rule substrate.
As the N-end rule pathway is an upstream branch
of the ubiquitin proteasome-system, we then investigated
whether the degradation of LynΔN is proteasomedependent. We studied the degradation of the wild type
LynΔN using the CHX protocol described above using
HEK293T cells in the presence or absence 10 μM of
MG132 proteasome inhibitor. The data shown in Figure 2c
reveals that the addition of MG132 results in stabilization
of LynΔN, demonstrating a role for the proteasome for
LynΔN degradation.
The targeted degradation of proteins via the N-end
rule pathway includes the recognition of the destabilizing
N-termini by specific E3 ubiquitin ligases. To identify
the E3 ubiquitin ligases that mediate the degradation
of LynΔN, we initially investigated the role of E3
ubiquitin ligases UBR1 and UBR2. UBR1 and UBR2
are redundant E3 ubiquitin ligase previously identified to
be components of the N-end rule pathway which when
deleted in combination result in embryonic lethality[28].
To investigate whether UBR1 and UBR2 are required
for degradation of LynΔN, the stability of LynΔN was
investigated in co-transfection experiments with mixtures
of plasmid vectors expressing shRNAs targeting UBR1
and UBR2. Both vector controls and plasmids expressing
scrambled shRNA sequences were used as controls. In
all cases the total amount of plasmid DNA was used for
each transfection was kept constant. The data in Figure 2d
reveals that LynΔN is unstable in both control experiments
(scrambled shRNAs and vector control). In contrast, when
UBR1 and UBR2 targeting shRNAs are simultaneously
expressed the degradation of LynΔN is nearly completely
inhibited. The knock down of both UBR1 and UBR2 by
shRNA expression were verified by Western blot analysis
for endogenous UBR1 (Figure 2e) and UBR2 (Figure
2f). The dependence on UBR1 and UBR2 for LynΔN
degradation is in agreement with the hypothesis that
degradation is via the N-end rule pathway.
As Lyn is a kinase, we investigate whether its
activity is required for degradation via the N-end rule. An
inactivating mutant (K275R), as previously described[29],
was introduced into the wild type ubiquitin-LynΔN fusion
construct. The stability of the wild type and K275R mutant

LynΔN were then investigated as described above. As
seen in Figure 2g, no significant change to the stability of
the protein was observed when the enzymatic activity of
LynΔN was blocked.
Initial investigations on LynΔN reported that this
fragment localizes to the cellular cytoplasm versus the
plasma membrane for the intact Lyn kinase[13]. We
evaluated the localization of the recombinant LynΔN
in HEK 293T cells to confirm its predicted cytoplasmic
localization and that this localization is independent of the
identity of the N-termini. Our results mimic the previously
reported localization as the C-terminal fragment is
localized to the cytoplasm (Figure 3). The cytoplasmic
localization was independent of the identity of the N
termini as identical results were obtained with fragments
with N-terminal arginine, valine or methionin (Figure 3).
We then investigated how the N-end rule
degradation of LynΔN influences the previously reported
anti-apoptotic role of this protein fragment[11]. Prior to
investigating the cellular effects of LynΔN in K562 cells
we first investigated that the LynΔN fragment was unstable
in these cells as we observed for the HEK293T cells. The
wild type LynΔN and the valine N-terminal mutant were
both transfected into K562 cells and the stability of the
proteins were investigated as described above with the
utilization of cycloheximide. As observed in Figure 4a, the
LynΔN with the wild type leucine N-termini was unstable
while the valine N-terminal mutant was not degraded. We
next investigated the sensitivity of K562 cells to imatinib
that have been transfected with plasmids expressing either
the wild type LynΔN, the stable valine N-terminal LynΔN

mutant or a vector control. After transfection, 1 μM
imatinib was added and the cells were evaluated by trypan
blue exclusion staining to quantify cell viability after
increasing times after imatinib addition. The data shown
in Figure 4b reveal that the active degradation of LynΔN
by the N-end rule significantly counters the imatinib
resistance provided by LynΔN, this is demonstrated by the
increased cell viability of K562 cells expressing the stable
valine LynΔN mutant.
To verify that the increased viability during imatinib
treatment as a result of LynΔN expression was a result of
reduced apoptosis, we then proceed to analyze the cells for
markers of apoptosis. The presence of phosphatidylserine
on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane[30] and
caspase activity[27]. The cells were stained with Annexin
V and propidium iodide (PI) and then analyzed by FACS.
Data from analyses are summarized in Figure 4c, where
the percentage of cells that were Annexin V positive or
both Annexin V and propidium iodide positive is plotted.
In agreement with the trypan blue staining, the expression
of the valine-LynΔN resulted in the fewest number of
apoptotic cells as observed by Annexin V and PI staining
upon treatment of the cells with imatinib. FACS analysis
was able to quantify a difference between the wild type
LynΔN and the vector control, indicating that even with
N-end rule degradation of LynΔN it can still function to
counter the apoptotic stimuli to some extent. When the
catalytically inactive form of LynΔN(K275R) is expressed,
no significant change in the number of apoptotic cells was
observed in comparison to the vector control. Western blot
analysis to evaluate caspase activity by detecting caspase
dependent PARP cleavage[27] is shown in Figure 4d. This
data reveals that the expression of the stable valine-LynΔN
protein results in a significant delay in the detection of the
cleaved PARP fragment and thus caspase activation, where

cleavage is only observed after 48 hours after the addition
of imatinib. As a control for all the viability analysis we
had also quantified the amount of expressed LynΔN in the
cells (Figure 4d). As shown in the Western blot, all three
forms were expressed but valine-LynΔN was detected in
higher abundance. This increased amount is predicted as
this is the stable form of LynΔN.
Together our data demonstrate that LynΔN is
degraded in cells and this degradation is a result of
the proteolytically exposed N-terminal leucine being
recognized by the N-end rule machinery. In agreement
with our proposed model of N-end rule degradation
of LynΔN (Figure 5), we have demonstrated that
degradation can be prevented by changing the identity
of the N-terminal amino acid to valine. It is somewhat
remarkable that this relatively small change of leucine
to valine make such a significant difference in protein
stability. The importance of the role for this leucine
may explain its complete conservation in vertebrates.
Consistent with LynΔN being an N-End rule substrate is
the proteasome, UBR1 and UBR2 dependent degradation.

MATERIALS & METHODS

The degradation of LynΔN by the N-end rule
pathway is an additional example of how the N-End rule
pathway can function in a pro-apoptotic function. This was
demonstrated by how the valine-LynΔN stabilizing mutant
provides significantly higher imatinib resistance to K562
cells. A previous example of N-End rule dependent cell
death has been previously described with macrophages
treated with anthrax lethal toxin[26]. In conjunction with
previous reports demonstrating anti-apoptotic functions of
the N-End rule in other pathways[21, 23], it is becoming
apparent that the role of the N-end Rule pathway cannot
be specifically labeled as a pro- or anti-apoptotic pathway.
The commonality of the reported examples of proteins
being targeted for degradation is that the N-End rule
counters the proteolytic activation of these proteins.

Generation of ubiquitin fusion cleaved Lyn
expression vector
To express the cleaved Lyn fragment we cloned
the cleaved Lyn (isoform 1) as a fusion between an
N-terminal ubiquitin and C-terminal triple FLAG tag (3x
FLAG) that had been previously cloned in a pcDNA 3.1
hygro plasmid[24]. A cDNA clone (clone ID: MHS6278211689273, Open Biosystems) was used for cloning the
Lyn sequence, and the sequence used corresponds to
amino acids 19 to 512. This sequence of Lyn corresponds
to the sequence from the known caspase cleavage site[13]
to the C-terminal end of the protein.

Site directed mutagenesis
Mutagenesis of the codon for the leucine
corresponding to the N-termini of the cleaved Lyn protein
were performed by site directed mutagenesis to change the
codon to arginine (CGG), valine (GUG) and methionine
(AUG). Similarly, the kinase dead form of cleaved Lyn
was obtained through mutating the lysine residue at
position 275 in the putative ATP-binding site to arginine
(CGG) by site directed mutagenesis.

Cell culture
HEK293T cells were obtained from the ATCC
and K562 cells were obtained from Dr. Chris Bleakly
(University of Alberta, Canada). The HEK293T cells were
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine
serum (FBS). K562 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 with
10% FBS.

Cell transfection
HEK293T were transfected using the Calcium
phosphate-based method as previously described[31].
K562 cells were transfected using electroporation
(Neon transfection system) according to manufacturer’s
procedures (Pulse voltage 1450 v, Pulse width (ms) 10 and
3 pulses).
