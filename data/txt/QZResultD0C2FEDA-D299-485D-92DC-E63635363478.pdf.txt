Abstract
As angiogenesis is required for tumor growth and metastasis, suppressing
angiogenesis is a promising strategy in limiting tumor progression. Vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, a critical pro-angiogenic factor, has thus become
an attractive target for therapeutic interventions in cancer. In this study, we explored
the underlying mechanisms of a novel anthraquinone derivative DDA in suppressing
angiogenesis. DDA inhibited VEGF-A-induced proliferation, migration and tube
formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). DDA also reduced
VEGF-A-induced microvessel sprouting from aortic rings ex vivo and suppressed
neovascularization in vivo. VEGF-A-induced VEGFR1, VEGFR2, FAK, Akt, ERK1/2 or
STAT3 phosphorylation was reduced in the presence of DDA. In addition, NRP-1 siRNA
reduced VEGF-A’s enhancing effects in VEGFR2, FAK and Akt phosphorylation and cell
proliferation in HUVECs. DDA disrupted VEGF-A-induced complex formation between
NRP-1 and VEGFR2. Furthermore, systemic administration of DDA was shown to
suppress tumor angiogenesis and growth in in vivo mouse xenograft models. Taken
together, we demonstrated in this study that DDA exhibits anti-angiogenic properties
through suppressing VEGF-A signaling. These observations also suggest that DDA
might be a potential drug candidate for developing anti-angiogenic agent in the field
of cancer and angiogenesis-related diseases.

Introduction

VEGF-A augments serial steps of angiogenesis
such as increasing vascular endothelial cell proliferation,
migration and vascular permeability [8]. VEGF-A
exhibits these angiogenic properties through the binding
and activation of receptor tyrosine kinases known as
VEGFR-2/Flk-1/KDR [9]. VEGF-A binds to VEGFR2
and thereby activates several signaling pathways such
as Src, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK),
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), focal adhesion kinase
(FAK) and protein kinase B (Akt) [10]. These signaling
cascades stimulate endothelial cell survival, migration,
proliferation and forming tubular structures [11–13].
In addition, VEGF-A signaling pathway also involves
signal transducers and activators of transcription proteins
(STATs) [14]. Yahata Y. et al. [15] demonstrated that
STAT3 is required for VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis.
VEGF-A-VEGFR2 signaling thus represents a promising
therapeutic target in suppressing angiogenesis or
angiogenesis-related diseases [16].

Angiogenesis, a new blood vessel forming process,
consists of basement membrane degradation, endothelial
cell migration, proliferation and formation of tubular
structures. It participates in various pathological events
such as diabetic retinopathy, arthritis and malignancy
beyond its role in physiological processes [1, 2]. Given
the key role of angiogenesis in tumor progression [3],
targeting angiogenesis to destruct tumor vasculature
thus represents a promising strategy to suppress
tumor progression [3, 4]. Tumor cells or tumor microenvironment promotes angiogenesis through the induction
of various cytokines or growth factors such as vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin, basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and epidermal growth
factor (EGF)[5]. The VEGF family member VEGF-A
contributes mainly to tumor angiogenesis and elevated
VEGF-A level is associated with tumor progression [6, 7].

Currently, the assessment of various strategies that
interfere with VEGF-A-VEGFR2 in clinical trials are
undertaken. For instance, small molecule inhibitors that
suppress VEGFR2 kinase activity [17], soluble receptors
that sequester VEGF-A [18] and antibodies targeting
VEGF-A or VEGFR [19]. To date, the United States
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the
clinical use of monoclonal antibody such as bevacizumab
(Avastinâ) [20] and small molecule inhibitors such as
sorafenib (Nexavarâ, BAY 43-9006) in the treatment of
treating certain types of cancers [20]. However, adverse
effects with bleeding-related complications of most
receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been reported
[21]. Therefore, developing novel anti-angiogenesis agents
with milder side effects is still being investigated [22].
Anthraquinone
derivatives
exhibit
broad
pharmacological properties and have been extensively
investigated. Recent studies reported their potential use
as anti-tumor agents [23–25]. They also exhibit antiangiogenic properties [26], but the mechanisms for this
effect remain incompletely understood at this time. Given
their potential as lead compound for drug discovery, we
explored the anti-angiogenic mechanisms of a novel
anthraquinone derivative DDA (1,5-dihydroxy-4,8-dinitro
anthraquinone). We demonstrated that DDA inhibited
VEGFR2 signaling and subsequent angiogenesis in
VEGF-A-stimulated HUVECs. In Matrigel plug models,
DDA suppressed VEGF-A- and breast cancer cell line
MDA-MB-231cells-induced angiogenesis in vivo.
Furthermore, DDA also reduced HCT116 xenograft
growth. Taken together, we demonstrated in this study that
DDA might be a potential therapeutic agent in suppressing
angiogenesis and consequent tumor progression.

determined by transwell invasion assay (Figure 1D). In
addition, DDA at these concentrations (1–10 μM) barely
altered VEGF-A mRNA and protein levels in HUVECs
(Supplementary Figure 1). We further used LDH assay
to determine whether any cytolytic effect contributes
to DDA’s inhibitory actions in VEGF-A-stimulated
HUVECs. LDH release did not significantly increase
in HUVECs after 24 h exposure to DDA (1–10 µM)
(Figure  1E). Moreover, DDA significantly suppressed
bFGF-induced cell proliferation, migration and invasion of
HUVECs (Supplementary Figure 2). These results suggest
that DDA suppresses angiogenesis through inhibiting cell
migration, proliferation and invasion without causing
cytolytic effect on HUVECs.

DDA inhibited HUVEC tube formation and
microvessel sprouting in response to VEGF-A
We next assessed DDA’s effect on HUVEC tube
formation. Results from tube formation assay showed
that capillary-like structure was formed by HUVECs
after 16 h exposure to VEGF-A (Figure 2A). However,
DDA (1–10 µM) reduced VEGF-A-induced capillarylike structure formation (Figure 2C). An ex vivo rat aortic
ring microvessel sprouting assay was also employed
to determine the DDA’s anti-angiogenesis effects. As
shown in Figure 2B, VEGF-A induced the complex
network formation by sprouting microvessels around the
aortic rings. However, DDA significantly suppressed this
phenomenon (Figure 2D), suggesting that DDA effectively
suppresses VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis ex vivo.

DDA reduced VEGF-A- or tumor-induced
neovascularization

Results

To explore whether DDA exhibits anti-angiogenic
effects in vivo, the murine matrigel plug model was
employed. As shown in Figure 3A, VEGF-A markedly
increased microvessel formation in Matrigel plug. In
contrast, DDA reduced VEGF-A’s enhancing effects
on neovascularization over a 7-day period as indicated
by the pale color of the plugs (Figure 3A, upper panel).
We also determined the hemoglobin content of the
plugs to quantify angiogenesis level. As compared with
the plugs removed from vehicle-treated control mice,
DDA significantly reduced neovascularization in plugs
(Figure 3A, lower panel). These observations indicate that
the intraperitoneal administration of DDA significantly
reduced angiogenesis in this in vivo assay. We also
used a xenograft tumor-induced angiogenesis model
to explore whether DDA inhibits tumor angiogenesis.
Matrigel mixed with human breast cancer MDAMB-231 cells was injected into the flanks of mice. After
implantation for 10 days, gel plugs were harvested. As
shown in Figure 3B, MDA-MB-231 cells markedly
increased neovascularization in the plug while this

DDA suppressed HUVEC proliferation,
migration and invasion in response to VEGF-A
To investigate whether the novel anthraquinone
derivative DDA exhibits anti-angiogenic activities, we
evaluate DDA’s effects on HUVEC proliferation. 2%
FBS-containing medium was used to starve HUVECs
for 16 h. After starvation, cells were treated with
VEGF-A (25 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of the
DDA (1–10 μM) for another 24 h. Results from MTT
assay demonstrated that DDA reduced cell viability in
VEGF-A-stimulated HUVECs (Figure 1A). Results
from BrdU labeling analysis showed that DDA reduced
cell proliferation in HUVECs after 24 h exposure of
VEGF-A (Figure 1B). We next explored whether DDA
affects cell motility in HUVECs. Results from woundhealing migration assay showed that HUVEC motility
was reduced in the presence of DDA (1–10 μM) using
VEGF-A as a chemoattractant (Figure 1C). DDA also
reduced cell invasion in VEGF-A-stimulated HUVECs as

effect was reduced by DDA (Figure 3B, upper panel).
The angiogenesis level was also quantified. As shown
in Figure 3B, lower panel, DDA significantly reduced
tumor cells-elicited angiogenesis in vivo. Moreover, we
also evaluated whether DDA affects cell proliferation in
MDA-MB-231, PC3 (human prostate cancer cell line),

HCT116 (human colorectal cancer cell line), HepG2
(human liver hepatocellular carcinoma cell line) and
HS68 (human fibroblast line) cells. Serum-induced cell
proliferation of non-tumor HS68 fibroblasts and MDAMB-231 cells was barely altered after 24 h exposure of
10 μM DDA (Supplementary Figure 4). In contrast, DDA

significantly reduced serum-increased HCT116, HepG2
and PC3 cell proliferation (Supplementary Figure 4).
These observations suggest that DDA’s anti-proliferative
activity may vary among different cell types and DDA
may target to proliferating endothelial cells to suppress
MDA-MB231 tumor cells-induced angiogenesis.

also suppressed VEGF-A-induced phosphorylation of
FAK (Figure 5B), STAT3 (Figure 5C), AKT (Figure 5D)
and ERK1/2 (Figure 5E) in HUVECs. Furthermore, DDA
also reduced bFGF-induced FGFR phosphorylation in
HUVECs beyond its inhibitory effects against VEGF-AVEGFR2 signaling (Supplementary Figure 3).

DDA inhibited VEGFR2 signaling in HUVECs

DDA suppressed the formation of NRP-1VEGFR2 complex in VEGF-A-stimulated
HUVECs

Upon
VEGF-A
binding,
VEGFR2
is
phosphorylated, leading to many downstream signaling
molecules activation. These signaling molecules such
as ERK1/2, FAK, Akt and STAT3 are responsible
for endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube
formation. These signaling molecules include ERK1/2,
FAK , Akt and STAT3 [11–13, 15, 27]. In addition to
VEGFR2, it is reported that VEGFR1 amplifies VEGF-A’s
responsiveness [28]. We thus determined whether DDA
suppresses VEGF-A-induced VEGFR1 and VEGFR2
activation in HUVECs. As shown in Figure 4, DDA
inhibited VEGF-A-induced VEGFR1 (Figure 4B) and
VEGFR2 (Figure 4C) phosphorylation. Moreover, DDA

Several lines of evidence demonstrated that VEGF-A
induced association of neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and VEGFR2
in HUVECs [29]. NRP-1 also contributes to VEGFA-induced angiogenesis in endothelial cells [29–31].
Co-immunoprecipitation analysis was employed to
examine whether DDA affects VEGF-A-induced
association of the NRP-1-VEGFR2 complex. As shown in
Figure 6A, VEGF-A rapidly induced complex formation of
NRP-1 and VEGFR2 in HUVECs. However, DDA (10 μM)
caused NRP-1 dissociation from VEGFR2 (Figure 6A). To
explore whether NRP-1 contributes to VEGF-A-induced

VEGFR2 phosphorylation and subsequent signaling
events, HUVECs were transiently transfected with NRP-1
siRNA before VEGF-A treatment. As shown in Figure 6B,
NRP-1 siRNA significantly inhibited VEGF-A-induced
cell proliferation. NRP-1 siRNA also reduced VEGFA-induced VEGFR2 (Figure 6D), FAK (Figure 6E) and
Akt (Figure 6F) phosphorylation in HUVECs. These
observations suggest that DDA’s anti-angiogenic actions
may also attribute to the disruption of complex formation
between NRP-1 and VEGFR2.

A mouse colorectal tumor xenograft model was
employed to investigate DDA’s inhibitory effects on
tumor growth. Intraperitoneal administration of DDA
(10 or 15 mg/kg/day) for 30 days markedly reduced
tumor volume (Figure 7A). In addition, DDA significantly
reduced tumor growth as tumor volume represents tumor
growth (Figure 7B) and tumor weight (Figure 7C). We next
used an anti-CD31 antibody to stain solid tumor sections

Discussion

to determine whether suppressing angiogenesis contributes
to DDA’s inhibitory effects on tumor growth. As shown in
Figure 7D, the blood vessels in DDA-treated xenografts
were less than that in the vehicle-treated xenografts. In
addition, the proliferative cells in DDA-treated tumors
sections were also reduced as determined by Ki67 staining
(Figure 7E). Most cancer therapeutic drugs are reported to
have adverse effects or severe cytotoxicity causing body
weight loss. Body weight of mice was thus monitored once
every 2 days throughout the whole experiment. As shown
in Figure 7F, the differences in body weights between
vehicle- and DDA-treated groups were not significant.
It indicates that DDA suppresses tumor growth through
suppressing tumor-induced angiogenesis without causing
body weight loss.

Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality
worldwide despite incremental advances in surgery,
chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Growing evidence
showed that inhibiting VEGF-A-VEGFR2 signaling
represents a potential therapeutic strategy in suppressing
tumor progression [32–34]. Several angiogenesis
inhibitors have already become a clinical anti-tumor
strategy in line with chemotherapy and radiotherapy
[35]. These observations led to increased efforts to
develop novel agents in suppressing angiogenesis. There
is increasing evidence demonstrating that anthraquinone
derivatives have beneficial effects in the treatment of
cancer [36–39]. In the present study, we identified a novel

anthraquinone derivative DDA, which exhibits antiangiogenic properties. We demonstrated that suppressing
VEGFR2 signaling contributes to its anti-angiogenic
effects. Our results also showed that DDA reduction
of tumor growth may be attributed to suppressing
angiogenesis in a tumor xenograft model.
Our previous studies demonstrated that PPemd26, a
novel anthraquinone derivative, exhibits anti-angiogenic
activity through suppression of VEGF-A-VEGFR2
signaling [40]. In this study, DDA, another small molecular
anthraquinone derivative with different structure, also

inhibited VEGFR2 and its downstream kinases in HUVECs
exposed to VEGF-A. These findings suggest that the
inhibition of VEGFR2 and subsequent signaling events may
contribute to anthraquinone derivatives’ anti-angiogenic
actions. The underlying mechanisms by which anthraquinone
derivatives suppress VEGFR2 signaling remain incompletely
understood. There is compelling evidence for an essential role
of neuropilin-1 (NRP1) in VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis in
endothelial cells [29–31]. It is believed that NRP1 acts as a
co-receptor for VEGFR and enhancing VEGF-A signaling
[29]. Herzog et al. [41] further demonstrated that NRP1

is essential for VEGF-A-induced FAK phosphorylation,
cell migration and angiogenesis of HUVECs. Consistent
with these observations, we demonstrated in this study
that NRP-1 siRNA reduced VEGFR2, Akt and FAK
phosphorylation in VEGF-A-stimulated HUVECs. We
also demonstrated that DDA inhibited VEGF-A-induced
complex formation between VEGFR2 and NRP-1. The
precise mechanisms of DDA in disrupting NRP-1-VEGFR2
complex formation remain to be further investigated. This is
the first time that we demonstrated NRP-1 may contribute to
an anthraquinone derivative, DDA’s actions in suppressing
VEGFR2 signaling pathway.

Although VEGF-A-VEGFR2 signaling plays
a central role in both physiological and pathological
angiogenesis, tumor angiogenesis may also involve other
angiogenic growth factors. Recent study demonstrated
that other angiogenic factors including bFGF might
co-operate with VEGF-A upon angiogenesis [42]. It is
plausible that agents targeting not only VEGF-A, but
also these angiogenic factors, may be more effective in
reducing tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. In addition to
VEGF-A, we noted in this study that DDA also exhibited
anti-angiogenic properties in HUVECs exposed to bFGF.
Further investigations are needed to characterize whether

DDA suppresses PDGF- or other angiogenic factorinduced angiogenesis and its underlying mechanisms.
Therefore, DDA might act as a multi-target angiogenesis
inhibitor.
Although DDA significantly reduced VEGF-Aor MDA-MB-231 cells-induced neovascularization
in vivo, DDA at 10 µM, however, did not cause cell
death in HUVECs and alter MDA-MB-231 cell

proliferation. It is likely that DDA targets endothelial
cells directly to suppress MDA-MB-231 cells-induced
neovascularization. Many studies have highlighted the
diverse pharmacological properties of the important
pharmacophore, anthraquinone [36–39]. In addition
to anti-angiogenic activity [26, 43, 44], suppression
of proliferation [45] and induction of apoptosis [46]
are also potential mechanisms for anti-cancer effects

of anthraquinone derivatives. It raises the possibility
that DDA may have additional anti-tumor effects. We
demonstrated in the HCT116 colorectal tumor xenograft
model that DDA markedly reduced tumor angiogenesis
and tumor growth. DDA also significantly inhibited seruminduced proliferation in HCT116, PC3 and HepG2 cells. It
is likely that DDA’s anti-tumor effects may also attribute
to its anti-proliferative activity in tumor cells. However,
DDA’s anti-proliferative actions on tumor cells might be
different among different tumor types. Furthermore, DDA
barely affected non-tumor HS68 fibroblast proliferation.
The differential effects of DDA’ actions in different
types of cancer cell remain to be further investigated.
Additional works are also needed to characterize the
underlying mechanisms by which DDA suppresses tumor
cell proliferation.
In conclusion, we showed in the present study that
DDA suppresses angiogenesis and tumor growth via, at
least in part, inhibiting VEGF-A-VEGFR2 signaling
pathways. DDA may serve as a valuable lead compound
in the development of anti-cancer therapy.

Cell viability assay (MTT assay)
Cell viability was measured by the colorimetric
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay as described previously [26].

Cell proliferation assay (BrdU incorporation
assay)
HUVECs (2 × 104 per well) were seeded in 96-well
tissue culture plates and incubated for 24 h. Cells were
then starved in M199 medium containing 2% FBS in the
absence of endothelial cell growth supplements for another
16 h. After starvation, cells were pretreated for 30 min
with various concentrations of DDA, followed by the
stimulation with VEGF-A (25 ng/ml) for another 24 h. Cell
proliferation was then determined by bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdU) cell proliferation enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (Millipore, Billerica, MA) based on the colorimetric
detection of the incorporation of BrdU, following the
manufacturer instructions.

Upstate Biotechnology. Recombinant human VEGF was
purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).

Wound-healing migration assay
HUVECs were allowed to grow to confluence in
six-well tissue culture plates precoated with 0.1% gelatin
(Sigma). Cells were then starved with M199 containing
2% FBS for 16 h. After starvation, monolayer HUVECs
were wounded by scratching with pipette tips and washed
with PBS. M199 containing 2% FBS was added into
the wells with or without 25 ng/mL VEGF and various
concentrations of DDA. Images of the cells were taken
after 24 h treatment. HUVECs were fixed with cold
4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.5% toluidine
blue in 4% paraformaldehyde. Images were taken by an
OLYMPUS Biological Microscope digital camera and
the rate of cell migration was determined by comparing

for 60 min in cell incubator. The bottom chambers were
filled with M199 medium containing 2% FBS in the
presence of VEGF (25 ng/ml) and the top chambers were
seeded with 200 µL M199 medium (without growth
factors) and HUVEC (105 cells per well). The top chamber
contained vehicle or various concentrations of DDA. After
12 to 16 h of migration, the cells on the top surface of
the membrane (non-migrated cells) were scraped with a
cotton swab and the cells spreading on the bottom sides of
the membrane (invasive cells) were fixed and stained with
0.5% toluidine blue in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min.
The cells were photographed and quantified by counting
the number of stained cells in three random fields at 40×
objectives under an OLYMPUS Biological Microscope
digital camera.

Immunoblotting analysis
Immunoblot analyses were performed as described
previously [47]. Briefly, cells were lysed in an extraction
buffer containing 15 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 50 mM NaCl,
1 mM PMSF, 5 mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05 mM
pepstatin A, and 0.2 mM leupeptin. Samples of equal
amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and
transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane
which was then incubated in a TBST buffer containing
5% BSA. Proteins were visualized by specific primary
antibodies and then incubated with HRP-conjugated
secondary antibodies. Immunoreactivity was detected
using chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system
following the manufacturer’s instructions. The blot
images were quantitated by densitometry using the Image
Quant analysis software and normalized with the internal
control (α-tubulin).

Matrigel tube formation assay
Matrigel, a basement membrane matrix extracted
from Engelbreth-Holm Swarm mouse sarcoma (Becton
Dickinson, Mountain View, CA), was polymerized for
30 min at 37°C. HUVECs suspended in M199 containing
2% FBS in the presence or absence of VEGF (25 ng/ml)
were seeded onto the Matrigel. They were then treated
with DDA at indicated concentrations. After 16 h,
cells were photographed using OLYMPUS Biological
Microscope digital camera at 20× magnification.

Co-immunoprecipitation
HUVECs were grown in 6 cm dishes. After reaching
confluence, cells were treated with 25 ng/ml VEGF-A for
5 min. The cells were harvested, lysed in 1 ml of lysis
buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 0.1%
Nonidet P-40, 6 mM EGTA, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate,
10 mM NaF, 300 μM sodium orthovanadate, 2 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin,
1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM dithiothreitol), and
centrifuged. The supernatant was immunoprecipitated
overnight with specific antibodies against NRP-1 in
the presence of protein A/G-agarose beads at 4°C. The
immunoprecipitated complex was washed three times
with lysis buffer. The samples were fractionated on 8%
SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride
and subjected to immunoblotting with antibodies specific
for VEGFR2.

Aortic ring sprouting assay
Assay was performed as previously described [47].
Aortic arch was dissected from 8 to 10-week-old SpragueDawley rats. After removing the surrounding fibro-adipose
tissues and thoroughly rinsing with M199 culture medium,
the aortas were cut into 1 mm ring segments. The aortic
rings were immersed in Matrigel in the wells of 48-well
plate. VEGF (25 ng/ml) with or without DDA was then
added to the wells. The aortic rings were cultured in 37°C
with 5% CO2 and the cultured medium was changed
every 3 days. Growing sprouts of endothelial cells were
observed and photographed on day 8. The images were
photographed into a computer by using an OLYMPUS
Biological Microscope, and sprouting area was determined
on the computer-digitized images with Image-Pro Plus
(Media Cybernetics) software. The analysis of sprouting
area was done by an observer who was blinded to the
treatment group. All animal study protocol was approved
by Laboratory Animal Use Committee of Collage of
Medicine, National Taiwan University.

Matrigel plug assay
VEGF-induced angiogenesis
Matrigel plug assay was performed as described
previously [47]. An aliquot (500 μl) of Matrigel containing
VEGF (200 ng/ml) with heparin (20 U) was injected
subcutaneously into the dorsal region of 6–8-week-old
C57BL/6 mice. Vehicle and DDA (2 or 5 mg/kg/day) was
then administered intraperitoneally once a day. After 7 days,
the animals were sacrificed, the intact Matrigel plugs were
carefully removed, and hemoglobin content in the plugs
was determined with Drabkin’s reagent kit (Sigma-Aldrich)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Suppression of neuropilin-1 (NRP1) expression
For NRP-1 suppression, predesigned
interfering (si) RNA targeting the human
gene were purchased from Dharmacon. The
oligonucleotides targeting the coding regions of
NRP-1 messenger (m)RNA were as follows:

Statistical analysis

MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (5 × 106 cells)
were mixed with phenol red-free Matrigel and injected
into both flanks of severely combined immunodeficient
(SCID) mice as described previously [48]. For DDAtreated group, Matrigel was mixed with cells or with
medium alone (500 µl) and heparin (20 U). Vehicle
and DDA (5 or 10 mg/kg/day) was then administered
intraperitoneally once a day. Ten days after implantation,
Matrigel plugs were removed and the surrounding tissues
trimmed. Hemoglobin levels of the Matrigel plugs were
evaluated with Drabkin’s reagent kit (Sigma-Aldrich)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
concentration of hemoglobin was calculated based on a
set of hemoglobin standards. All animal study protocol
was approved by Laboratory Animal Use Committee of
Collage of Medicine, National Taiwan University.

Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. from at
least three independent experiments. One-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was followed by the NewmanKeuls test, when appropriate, to determine the statistical
significance of the difference between means. A p value of
< 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Mouse xenograft model
4-week old BALB/cA nude mice were obtained
from National laboratory animal center (National Applied
Research Laboratories, Taipei, Taiwan) and maintained on
a 12-hour light/dark cycle under controlled temperature
(20 + 1oC) and humidity (55 + 5%) in clean specific
pathogen free (SPF) rooms. HCT116 cells (4 × 106 cells)
in a volume of 0.15 mL PBS were injected subcutaneously
into the right flank of each mouse. Once the tumor reached
approximately 100 mm3, animals were randomized into
the control group and the DDA treatment groups. Mice
were treated with DDA intraperitoneally once daily for
30 days. Tumors were measured every two-day by a digital
caliper. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula
V (mm3) = [ab2] × 0.52, where a is the length and b is
the width of the tumor [49]. At the end of treatment, mice
were anesthetized with pentobarbital (1.75 %) with body
temperature maintained at 37°C on a thermo-controlled
pad. Then the mice were sacrificed and tumors were
removed and weighed.

Immunohistochemistry analysis
Multiple cryosections were obtained from
HCT116 tumor xenografts for all immunohistochemical
analyses. CD31+ vessel area was assessed using rabbit
anti-mouse CD31/PECAM-1 antibody (Abcam) and
peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson
Research Laboratories) as described previously
[50]. Antibody binding was visualized using stable
diaminobenzidine. Images were obtained in four
different quadrants of each tumor section (2 mm inside
the tumor-normal tissue interface) at ×40 magnification.
The frozen sections were also used to determine the
proliferative cells with an anti-Ki67 antibody (Novus
Biologicals, Littleton, CO).
