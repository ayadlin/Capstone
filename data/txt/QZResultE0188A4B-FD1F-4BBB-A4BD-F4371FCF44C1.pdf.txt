ABSTRACT
The neuropilin-plexin receptor complex regulates tumor cell migration and
proliferation and thus is an interesting therapeutic target. High expression of
neuropilin-1 is indeed associated with a bad prognosis in glioma patients. Q-RTPCR and
tissue-array analyses showed here that Plexin-A1 is highly expressed in glioblastoma
and that the highest level of expression correlates with the worse survival of
patients. We next identified a developmental and tumor-associated pro-angiogenic
role of Plexin-A1. Hence, by using molecular simulations and a two-hybrid like assay
in parallel with biochemical and cellular assays we developed a specific Plexin-A1
peptidic antagonist disrupting transmembrane domain-mediated oligomerization of
the receptor and subsequent signaling and functional activity. We found that this
peptide exhibits anti-tumor activity in vivo on different human glioblastoma models
including glioma cancer stem cells. Thus, screening Plexin-A1 expression and targeting
Plexin-A1 in glioblastoma patients exhibit diagnostic and therapeutic value.

INTRODUCTION

recent progress in targeted therapy comprises blocking
various receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) [3] or inhibiting
angiogenesis [4]. However, the clinical outcome remains
poor and the overall survival of patients is only modestly
improved over last decade [5]. Hence, there is a crucial
need in identifying new therapeutic targets and to
develop efficient inhibitors of these targets preferably
avoiding side effects. We had taken advantage of one
important requirement for signal transduction of RTK
and other membrane receptors which is dimerization

Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating disease with
poor prognosis [1]. Highly infiltrative and vascularized,
these tumors are composed of multi-clonal cell types
with various migratory and proliferative properties,
and are genetically very heterogeneous. This obvious
cellular heterogeneity largely accounts for the observed
resistance to all available therapeutic strategies including,
surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy [2]. Significant

or oligomerization. We focused on the transmembrane
domain of single-pass transmembrane proteins. The
function of this domain contributes mainly to regulation of
signal transduction rather than membrane anchoring [6].
Transmembrane domain interactions (TMD) have been
described for many RTK including the ErbB family [7]
and other cell surface receptors such as integrins [8], the
amyloid precursor protein APP [9] or the T-cell receptor
[10]. Thus, targeting TMD interactions represents a unique
novel alternative strategy. Indeed, we had recently shown
that the TMD of Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) is crucial for the
dimerization and oligomerization of this receptor [11] that
controls a wide range of biological functions. Strikingly,
a synthetic peptide mimicking the TMD of NRP1
(MTP-NRP1) acts as a potent inhibitor by antagonizing
dimerization. We had shown that MTP-NRP1 impaired
tumor cell migration and angiogenesis both in vitro and
in vivo assays thereby reducing brain tumor growth
[12] thus suggesting that TMD-interfering peptides may
represent a novel class of therapeutic agents [6]. Although
most work had focused on homo-dimerization of TMD
containing receptors, hetero-dimerization may be key
to their wide signaling function. We decided to further
explore the possibility of antagonizing signaling partners
of NRP1 by interfering with hetero-association of NRP1
with other important cancer associated receptors.
Here, we report that Plexin-A1 (PlexA1), one of
the signaling partners of NRP1 [13] is a potential novel
prognostic marker for GBM patient survival. Using
computer simulation and a two-hybrid system (BACTH)
we further showed that NRP1/PlexA1 TMDs do interact
with each other by forming trimers. We demonstrated that
a synthetic transmembrane peptide mimicking the TMD
of PlexA1 (MTP-PlexA1) reduced GBM cell proliferation
and blocked VEGF-induced tumor cell dissemination
due to disruption of NRP1/PlexA1 heterodimerisation
and subsequent inhibition of the PlexA1 dependent RhoGTPase. Employing MTP-PlexA1 in GBM cancer models
revealed an anti-angiogenic activity largely accounting for
its antitumor activity. Overall, this study identifies PlexA1
as a novel potential biomarker of GBM as well as a novel
therapeutic target for which we have developed a specific
potent inhibitor.

control and negative control was performed by omitting
primary antibody (Figure 1C). Quantitative analysis
revealed a correlation between glioma grade and the level
of PlexA1 expression. Grade II and grade III astrocytoma
showed increased levels of PlexA1 being intermediate to
grade I and IV (Figure 1D). To examine whether the high
expression of PlexA1 in GBM may have a prognostic value
we performed data mining of the Rembrandt repository
collection [20] (Supplementary Figure S1). Our analysis
of 385 annotated gliomas revealed that patients expressing
the highest level of PlexA1 (above the median expression
of PlexA1) had a reduced probability of survival (Median
survival = 510 days) when compared to patients expressing
lowest level of PlexA1 (below the median expression of
PlexA1, median survival 689 days, p = 0.0018, log rank
test). This large scale analysis confirmed the results
obtained with the tissue array. Strikingly, when restricting
the analysis to the group of GBM (grade IV) patients only
(n = 181), the correlation between the high level of PlexA1
and a reduced survival was still significant. Median
survival was 369 days for patients with expression above
median while it reached 474.5 days for patients whose
expression of PlexA1 was below the median (p = 0.0225,
log rank test). Further analysis taking into account age
or gender did not reveal additional information (data not
shown). However, we were able to confirm this correlation
of high expression of PlexA1 to poorest survival in an
independent data set, the TCGA repository collection.
In this collection of 499 GBM the median survival was
466 days for patients with the lowest PlexA1 (below the
median expression) and 370 days for those with highest
expression (above the median expression, p = 0.005, logrank test, Supplementary Figure S1D).

Molecular simulations analyzing PlexA1 and
NRP1 TMD interactions
Previous results discovered using coarse grain
simulation in a DOPC (Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine)
membrane bilayer model that NRP1 and PlexA1 TM
domains produce homo- and hetero-dimers [21] which
had been confirmed in a biochemical assays [22].
Here, we extended this analysis by simulating multiple
interactions between NRP1 and PlexA1 TM domains.
The time required for the formation of the TMD1
NRP1-TMD2 NRP1 homodimer is not exceeding 5 µs
(Figure 2A top, simulation 1). The two TM domains
associated in right handed interactions with a crossing
angle of −32° on average. The contact map (Figure 2A)
showed symmetric and well-defined interacting motif
M12xxxG16xxxG20 with closest distances around 0.5
nm. One µs later TMD3 PlexA1 approached TMD1
NRP1-TMD2 NRP1 homodimer to form a stable trimer
until the end of the simulation (18 µs) (Figure 2B and 2C
top). The crossing angles were +33° and +4° on average
for the heterodimers TMD2 NRP1-TMD3 PlexA1 and

RESULTS
PlexA1 is a prognostic marker of GBM
We first determined the expression of PlexA1 in our
collection of 17 GBM RNA samples using Q-RTPCR.
This revealed a systematic overexpression of PlexA1
ranging from 1.6- to 40-fold when compared to grade II
astrocytoma (Figure 1A). To further explore the expression
profile of PlexA1 we performed a tissue micro-array
(US Biomax) on a total of 295 biopsies of patients with
glioma (Figure 1B). Normal brain tissue served as positive

TMD1 NRP1-TMD3 PlexA1 respectively. The TMD2
NRP1-TMD3 PlexA1 contact map exhibited the key
interfacial residues A11 and A14 for TMD2 NRP1 and
G9 for TMD3 PlexA1 (closest distances around 0.5
nm) (Figure 2B bottom). Milder contacts, with closest
distances around 0.7 nm, were observed between TMD1
NRP1 (V22 and V26) and TMD3 PlexA1 (V20 and
A23) (Figure 2C bottom). A representative conformation

of this trimer is shown in Supplementary Figure S3A.
When simulating the association of TMD1 NRP1-TMD2
PlexA1-TMD3 PlexA1 interaction (simulation 2) we very
quickly (about 1 µs) observed the formation of a TMD1
NRP1-TMD2 PlexA1 heterodimer (Figure 2D top). The

a crossing angle of −33° on average. Beyond 26 µs the

and then joined the TMD1 NRP1-TMD2 PlexA1
heterodimer to form a stable trimer until the end of the
simulation (40 µs) (Figure 2E and 2F top). The TMD1
NRP1-TMD3 PlexA1 heterodimer and TMD2 PlexA1TMD3 PlexA1 homodimer associated in right handed
interactions with crossing angles equal to −36° and −45°
respectively. The contact maps exhibited the interacting
motif M12xxxG16xxxG20 for TMD1 NRP1 and the
key residues G11, G15 and L19 for TMD2 PlexA1 and
TMD3 PlexA1. A representative conformation of this

trimer is shown in Supplementary Figure S3B. Hence, a
longer molecular dynamic simulation implicating 3 NRP1
TMD and 3 PlexA1 TMD (simulation 3) showed that
interactions were highly dynamic and allowed transitions
from hetero-dimers to trimeric complexes eventually
interacting with each other (Figure 2G). Thus, the CGMD simulations suggested that adding a synthetic peptide
mimicking the TMD of PlexA1 could compete with
naturally occurring TMD interactions thereby leading to
signal transduction alteration as previously described [11].

PlexA1 TMD exhibit specific interactions

GPA, HER2 or Integrin Beta-1 showed no significant
interaction with PlexA1 TMD while all of these receptors
contain GxxxG-like motifs thereby demonstrating the
high specificity of the interacting profile of PlexA1 TMD
(Figure 3B).
A surface plasmon resonance (SPR, Biacore) analysis
was also conducted with a synthetic biotinylated PlexA1
peptide immobilized on the chip. This allowed us to confirm
some of the results obtained by BACTH because the PlexA1
TMD mimetic peptide significantly interacted with NRP1
(chosen as a positive interaction according to the BACTH
assay) but not with VEGFR-2 (chosen as a negative
interaction from the BACTH results) (Figure 3C–3D). Due
to the high hydrophobic nature and difficulty to produce
TMD peptides we only performed this experiment with
TMD peptides for which we had experience of successful
synthesis.

To further explore the TMD interactions of PlexA1
we used a bacterial two-hybrid system for a more
systematic analysis of TMD interactions [22]. TMD
sequences of PlexA1 and various potential interacting
partners including NRP1 and all other members of the
Plexin-A family were co-expressed in the bacteria to
define the hierarchy of the interactions. This interaction
study confirmed computer simulations as demonstrated
by a significant interaction between NRP1 and PlexA1
TMD (Figure 3A). The systematic analysis confirmed
the homo-dimerization capacity of PlexA1 and also
revealed positive interactions with the TMD of Plexin-A4
but weaker interactions with Plexin-A2 and Plexin-A3.

of Plexin-B1, cMET, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3,

MTP-PlexA1 disrupts dimerization of PlexA1
with its co-receptors

(in which 3 glycines of the GxxxGxxxG motif were
replaced by 3 valines or MTP-Neu, an anti-breast cancer
peptide known to not interact with PlexA1) as described
in Supplementary Figure S2. Moreover, we found that
Sema3A-induced co-immunoprecipitation of NRP1 or
Plexin-A4 with PlexA1 was significantly reduced (−24.6%
for NRP1 and −35.5% for PlexA4) in the presence of MTPPlexA1 (Figure 4A). Similar results were obtained when cells
were exposed to VEGF (39.4% NRP1 and 35.4% PlexA4,
Figure 4B). Altogether these results demonstrate that MTPPlexA1 is able to reduce oligomerization of PlexA1 in resting
conditions or in response to Sema3A or VEGF ligands.

To demonstrate that MTP-PlexA1 is able to alter
receptor complex formation we performed an in situ
proximity ligation assay (Duo-link system, Sigma-Aldrich)
[23]. As seen in Figure 3E, we observed numerous NRP1/
PlexA1 complexes at the cell surface (U373MG cells) in
control conditions (vehicle treated cells). However, the
addition of MTP-PlexA1 induced a 29.4% reduction of
NRP1/PlexA1 complexes. Additional specificity controls
were performed using a mutated version of MTP-PlexA1

MTP-PlexA1 blocks the signaling capacity of
PlexA1

on HUVEC migration (−68%, p = 0.0087) (Figure 5D).
Interestingly, the use of the mutated version of MTPPlexA1 confirmed the specificity of this anti-angiogenic
effect because MTP-PlexA1mut was not able to reduce
the number of tube-like structures (see Supplementary
Figure S2B). This inhibition of VEGFA-induced HUVEC
cell migration was confirmed in a live monitoring transwell assay with MTP-PlexA1 (−63%, p = 0.0002;
X-Celligence system, ACEA Biosciences, Figure 5E).
Hence, to further validate the inhibition of the PlexA1
pro-angiogenic activity in the presence of MTP-PlexA1
we also analyzed the vascular development of the chorioallantoic membrane of the chick embryo. In this assay we
confirmed the expression of PlexA1 in developing blood
vessels and we also showed that local deposition of MTPPlexA1 significantly inhibited VEGFA-induced vascular
growth and complexity (Figure 5F). Altogether, these
results characterized the pro-angiogenic effect of PlexA1
and demonstrated that this effect can be fully antagonized
with MTP-PlexA1.

PlexA1 is a Rho-GTPase activating protein.
Consistently, it has been shown that in response to
Sema3A, the Rho-GTPase Rac1 is activated and
sequestered at the plasma membrane [24]. Here, using
an ELISA-based assay we were able to show that MTPPlexA1 significantly inhibited Sema3A-induced Rac1
activity while not affecting this Rho-GTPase activity in
the absence of ligand (Figure 4C). Moreover, it has been
shown that Sema3A inhibits Akt phosphorylation through
binding of Rnd1 to PlexA1. Our data show that Sema3Ainduced inhibition of Akt phosphorylation (−33%,
Figure 4D) is blocked by the addition of MTP-PlexA1.
Hence, a previous study suggested a pro-angiogenic
effect of PlexA1 [25]. Indeed, when measuring the
phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 using an ELISA assay we
also found that MTP-PlexA1 significantly reduced VEGFinduced phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 (−26%, Figure 4E).
From these experiments we concluded that MTP-PlexA1
is able to antagonize major signaling pathways of PlexA1
receptor.

MTP-PlexA1 inhibits tumor growth
To address the biological consequences of MTPPlexA1-mediated inhibition of PlexA1 we used the
U118MG-Luc glioma cell line genetically engineered
to express the luciferase reporter gene. The addition of
MTP-PlexA1 to U118MG-Luc cells reduced proliferation
in a dose dependent manner as measured in a MTT assay
(Figure 6A). Cells were then grafted subcutaneously and
tumor growth was monitored every 5 days for a total period
of 20 days. As seen in Figure 6B, U118MG-Luc formed
large tumors continuously growing in control conditions
while tumor growth was dramatically slowed down in the
animals receiving the therapeutic peptide every day (1 µg/
kg). The quantitative analysis of the cumulated luminescent
signal acquired all along the protocol confirmed the strong
reduction of tumor development translating into a marked
75% reduction of the averaged luminescent signal at the
end point (Figure 6C). The waterfall graph of best response
[26] also showed that 2 out of 10 mice did not respond
to the treatment. However, responses were strong for 8
out of 10 mice with some responses close to 100%, all
of them being at least Partial Response (PR) (Figure 6D).
In order to clarify the mechanism by which MTP-PlexA1
is exerting tumor growth inhibition we collected tumors
and analyzed them histologically. When performing a
proximity ligation assay on tumor tissue sections we could
visualize a two-fold reduction of interactions of PlexA1
and NRP1 when mice had been treated with MTP-PlexA1
(−48.5%, p = 0.0051, Mann Whitney test, Figure 6E). We
also found that the number of proliferative cells determined
by counting PH3 positive cells on the whole surface of 5
sections per tumor was 37.3% (p = 0.0022, Mann Whitney
test) decreased in treated animals compared to the control
group (Figure 6F). Moreover, when determining the

PlexA1 exhibits a pro-angiogenic activity that
can be blocked by MTP-PlexA1
We observed PlexA1 positive blood vessels in the
tissue array of GBM samples (Figure 5A). Interestingly,
blood vessels in control normal brain tissue were not
expressing PlexA1. Additional experiments performed in
the mouse brain showed that only developing embryonic
but not mature adult blood vessels expressed PlexA1
(see Supplementary Figure S4). These data suggested a
role of PlexA1 during developmental and pathological
angiogenesis. To address this possibility we first used a
transgenic zebra-fish model tg(kdrl:eGFP) highlighting
the endothelial cells. This allowed us to assess the
angiogenic activities in vivo by analyzing formation of
intersegmental vessels (ISVs) after morpholino-based
knockdown of the target. Indeed, using a morpholino
sequence against PlexA1 previously characterized
[19] we observed a significant number of abnormal
angiogenic sprouts in ISVs when compared to controls
(no injection of morpholino) or mismatch PlexA1
morpholino 28 hours post fertilization (Figure 5B).
This result confirmed in vivo the importance of PlexA1
in blood vessel development. We next performed a 3D
migration assay with HMEC spheroids grown in a plasma
clot and showed that VEGFA-induced cell migration was
abolished when adding the PlexA1 inhibitory peptide
(Figure 5C). Moreover, using a pseudo-tube formation
assay with human endothelial HUVEC cells grown on
matrigel, we found that the addition of MTP-PlexA1
significantly blocked tube-like structure intersections
thereby demonstrating a negative impact of the peptide

density of blood vessels using CD31 immunostaining we
found a significant 11.4% reduction (p = 0.0436, Mann
Whitney test) of tumor-associated blood vessels in the
animal group receiving MTP-PlexA1 (Figure 6G). This
part of the study demonstrated that inhibition of tumor
growth in vivo can be explained by an anti-proliferative
and an anti-angiogenic effect of MTP-PlexA1 mirroring
the results of the in vitro assays. Hence, we performed an

orthotropic grafting experiment to monitor the effect of
MTP-PlexA1 on GBM tumors developing in their native
microenvironment. While not strongly impacting on
tumor volume (−14.5%, p = 0.54, Mann Whitney test) the
intraperitoneal administration of MTP-PlexA1 (1 µg/kg)
every 3 days for 3 weeks induced a significant inhibition of
cell proliferation (−38.3% PH3 positive cells p = 0.0023,
Mann Whitney test, Supplementary Figure S5A–S5B)

of MTP-PlexA1 treated mice in comparison to controls. A
similar anti-tumor effect was also demonstrated in tumors

This is particularly the case for gliomas [28]. Thus, we

decided to evaluate to what extent MTP-PlexA1 would
affect glioma stem cell (GSC) growth. To this end, we
used the NCH644 human cell line derived from a patient
biopsy [29]. As seen in Figure 7A, GSCs co-express
PlexA1 and stem cell markers Nestin or Sox2. Moreover,
Q-RTPCR analysis revealed that NCH644 cells exhibited
strong overexpression of PlexA1 when compared to the
level in normal brain (23 fold) or grade II astrocytoma
(78 fold) (Figure 7B). Interestingly, MTP-PlexA1 reduced
the proliferation capacity of the GSC grown in large
populations as seen using a MTS assay (−10% p < 0.0001,
Figure 7C). We next performed a sphere forming assay in
which cells were plated into 96-well plates at a low density
(30 cells per well) to monitor production of clones from

individual cells growing as non-adherent gliomaspheres.
A minimum of 30 cells per well was required to allow
sufficient sphere production (composed of at least 8 cells)
in a time frame compatible with drug testing. Visual
control of sphere formation on a daily basis confirmed
that cellular edifices were arising from single cells and
not due to cell clumping. Strikingly, the addition of MTPPlexA1 at a concentration of 10−9 M decreased the ability
of GSC to form sphere by 33.3% (vehicle = 100% +/−
9.7%; MTP-PlexA1= 66.7% +/− 5.2, p = 0.0015, Student
T test) thereby demonstrating the capacity of the peptide
to inhibit GSC clonal expansion (Figure 7D). To address
whether this inhibitory effect is sufficient to impede
tumor development in vivo we performed a xenograft

nude mice in a way to obtain two bilateral tumors derived
from either control cells without treatment or from cells
that had been pre-incubated with MTP-PlexA1. This was
done using a fluorescent version of the NCH644 cell line
(mCherry-NCH644) allowing live monitoring of tumor
appearance (Figure 7E). We choose to monitor tumor
development over a 5 days period of time as a compromise
to reach the size of detectable tumors while conserving
significant inhibitory activity of MTP-PlexA1 (at least
for the first three days as previously shown for equivalent
membrane targeting peptides [12]). Because we failed
to detect tumors when grafting the cells in the brain for
sensitivity reasons, this experiment was conducted in a
subcutaneous localization. Strikingly, with control cells we
observed the development of 14 tumors in the 20 grafted
mice (Figure 7E). However, GCS pre-incubated with the
peptides only rarely gave rise to detectable tumors (4 out
of 20 mice, −71.4%, p = 0.0032, Mann Whitney test).
However, the pre-incubation of the cells with the peptide
was not sufficient to block the proliferation of the cells
over the 5 days period because the size of the few tumors
that were able to grow was comparable to the one of the
control group (p = 0.4258, Mann Withney test, Figure 7F).

we failed to detect PlexA1 in blood vessels in human
normal brain or in adult mouse brain. The expression of
PlexA1 in blood vessels was restricted to developmental
and tumor angiogenesis. Thus, because angiogenesis is
a marker of cancer severity [35] and more precisely of
glioma malignancy [36], the prognostic value of PlexA1
may be the consequence of this expression in tumorassociated blood vessels. In the present study both in vitro
and in vivo assays showed a clear pro-angiogenic role
of PlexA1. This is consistent with previous work that
showed inhibition of tube formation by HUVEC cells
upon knocked-down of PlexA1 [25]. Because no study
reports the direct binding of VEGF to PlexA1, PlexA1mediated endothelial cell migration and blood vessel
formation requires the involvement of VEGF binding
partners and/or VEGFR modulators. The results of our coimmunoprecipitation experiment showed in the presence
of MTP-PlexinA1 a reduction of PlexinA1-NRP1 and
PlexinA1-PlexinA4 interaction, two receptors involved in
glioma-associated tumor angiogenesis [25]. We however
cannot exclude that additional pro-angiogenic ligands
such as PDGF, FGF, TGF-b1, that have been shown to be
linked to NRP1 [37–39], may also recruit PlexA1 directly
or indirectly through the formation of specific receptor
complexes. Coarse grain simulations revealed the dynamic
association of NRP1 and PlexA1 TMDs being capable of
homodimerization, heterodimerization, oligomerization
and/or transitions from one status to the other. This highly
dynamic behavior is probably the source of a wide range
of interaction capabilities of PlexA1. The role of TMD in
the association and stabilization of membrane anchored
receptor is becoming well-described. This is demonstrated
for several families of receptors including TLR [10],
integrins [8] or tyrosine kinase [40]. Very recently, it
has been shown that the activation of EGFR requires
an N-terminal interaction between the transmembrane
helices [41, 42]. These studies clearly showed that both
TMD and juxtamembrane domain influence extracellular
domain of EGFR receptor. Thus, besides the importance
of extracellular domain interactions in regulating ligand
binding and receptor association, TMD should now be also
considered as crucial regulators of receptor activity. The
contact maps we created from simulations revealed the
existence of multiple potential interfaces with unexpected
amino acids (such as the G11xxxG15xxxL19) favoring the
different types of interactions between NRP1 and PlexA1
with adapted crossing angles. PlexA1 TMD contains
long series of 6 glycines (G9, G11–G15) generating two
GxxxG like motifs being on different faces of the helix
therefore creating at least two opposite surfaces for
interactions. Related TMD interactions are very specific
because PlexB1, c-MET, VEGFR-1,-2,-3, HER-2,
Integrin-β1 TMD exhibited no significant interaction with
PlexA1 TMD. Thus, the existence of a GxxxG motif is
not sufficient to trigger an interaction. Rather, the whole
sequence is defining the specificity of interactions. Hence,

DISCUSSION
While confirming that targeting the transmembrane
domain of membrane receptors offers a credible alternative
to other existing drugs targeting intra or extra cellular
domains of membrane receptors, our study identifies novel
functions for PlexA1 with fundamental novel and clinical
relevance.
The identification of suitable biomarkers is
complicated in GBM by the short range of patient
survival, the great heterogeneity as well as an incomplete
understanding of the physiopathology of these tumors. For
example, the IDH1 mutation appears to be a prognostic
marker (with better outcome) for GBM [30] and EGFR
amplification is frequent in GBM (25% to 33%, [31]). The
MGMT methylation is also considered as a prognostic
tool and a predictive marker of drug efficacy since it is
correlated with a better response to alkylating agents such
as temozolomide [32]. Here, we found that the expression
of PlexA1 correlated with the grade of glioma defining
three groups with low (grade I), medium (Grade II/III)
and high PlexA1 expression in high grade glioma (Grade
IV, glioblastoma). The prognostic value of PlexA1 has
already been described for patients with pancreatic tumors
[33]. Our results now suggest that PlexA1 expression
level may also be considered as a potential diagnostic
and prognostic marker in glioblastoma. In the present
study, a striking feature of PlexA1 expression was the
staining of tumor associated blood vessels in patient
biopsies similarly to gastric cancer where PlexA1 is
associated with microvessel density [34]. Intriguingly,

it remains to be determined the exact fraction of peptide
reaching the tumors (heterotopic or brain orthotopic
tumors) to define the optimal dosage of the peptide.
Moreover, combination therapies with standard of care
strategies open novel opportunities. The most striking
result was obtained when using the patient derived cancer
stem cell line NCH644 [29]. Besides the high level of
PlexA1 expression in glioma stem cells, we also found that
MTP-PlexA1 inhibited sphere formation and proliferation.
This is indicating that blocking PlexA1 directly inhibited
the stem cell renewal capability in a range translating into
a marked inhibition of tumor production in vivo.
In conclusion, we had identified PlexA1 as a
diagnostic and prognostic marker of GBM. We also
described the developmental or tumor associated proangiogenic activity of this receptor that also promotes
tumor cell proliferation and migration. Furthermore we
demonstrated that the transmembrane domain of this
receptor regulates PlexA1 oligomerization and can be
antagonized by a peptide mimicking the native sequence.
Hence, this peptide appears as a good drug candidate to
interfere with cancer stem cells and angiogenesis thus
slowing down GBM growth.

Coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD)
simulations were used to investigate the dynamics of the
association of several NRP1 and PLXA1 TM domains
when embedded in a DOPC (1,2-di-oleoyl-sn-glycero3-phosphocholine) lipid bilayer. The GROMACS
software package (version 4.5.4) [14, 15] was used. The
TM peptides, the lipids and the water CG particles were
described with the MARTINI force-field version 2.1
[16–18]. A detailed procedure of the system setup and
analysis is provided in Supplementary Methods section.

Angiogenesis in the zebra fish

MATERIALS AND METHODS

For knockdown of PlexA1 in the zebra fish we
used morpholino oligonucleotides described by [19].
MO (5′-GCCACATATCTGCACTGGTCCTTGA-3′) was
injected at the one-cell stage. Animals (Tg(flk1:egfp))
were incubated at 28.5°C for 5 hours before treatment
with 1-phenyl-2-thiourea (PTU) to prevent pigment
formation. Zebrafish embryos were staged, anesthetized
with 0.02% tricaine solution, and mounted in drops of
0.8% low-melting point agarose (Sigma Aldrich). They
were imaged at 28 hpf using a confocal microscope: both
intersegmental vessels and the caudal plexus regions were
imaged.

GBM cell lines obtained from the ECACC and the
ATCC respectively. HUVEC (Human Umbilical Vein
Endothelial Cell) provided by PromoCell (C-12200) and
HMEC-1 (Human Microvascular Endothelial Cell-1)
provided by Dr Ellen van Obberghen-Schilling (Institute
of Biology Valrose, Nice). Details of culture are presented
in Supplementary Methods section.

Experiments were performed according to the
Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (E67-6482-21) and the European Directive with approval of the
regional ethical committee (Reference AL/55/62/02/13).
Heterotopic grafts were produced by injecting 106 cells in
the flank of pathogen-free NMRI nude mice (Janvier, Le
Genest Saint Isle, France). Intraperitoneal administration
of vehicle (LDS 72 µM) or MTP-PlexA1 treatment
(10–7 M) were done every days during 20 days when
the tumors reached a minimal volume of 100 mm3. For
the experiment conducted with cancer stem cell line
NCH644mCherry, we performed bilateral grafting of 106
cells on each flank of 20 nude mice without treatment or
pre-incubated for 1 hour with MTP-PlexA1 at 10–7 M.
After 5 days, the fluorescence emission of developing
tumors was recorded using the NightOwl system
(Berthold) using appropriate excitation and emission
filters (580 nm/620 nm respectively).

Tissue array and glioblastoma biopsies
Slides of human brain gliomas tissue arrays were
obtained from US Biomax (BS17016a/GL2083a/GL806b/
GL803a/CNS801). The detailed immunocytochemical
procedure is provided in Supplementary Methods section.
Samples from patients diagnosed with GBM were
provided by the Neurosurgery department of Hautepierre
hospital and collected by the Centre de Ressources
Biologiques (CRB). This collection was approved by the
French Ministry of Health and received authorization
number DC-2009-1016. All samples were anonymized for
research. Total RNA was extracted after cell dissociation
of human GBM surgical specimens immediately after
resection. RNAs of grade II Astrocytoma were purchased
from Clinisciences (CR562205). Details of the Q-RTPCR
analysis are provided in Supplementary Methods section.
