Abstract
The major goal of epigenetic therapy is to reverse aberrant
promoter hypermethylation and restore normal function of
tumor suppressor genes by the use of chromatin-modifying
drugs. Decitabine, or 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR), is a
well-characterized drug that is now Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic
syndrome. Although 5-aza-CdR is an extremely potent
inhibitor of DNA methylation, it is subject to degradation by
hydrolytic cleavage and deamination by cytidine deaminase.
We show that short oligonucleotides containing a 5-aza-CdR
can also inhibit DNA methylation in cancer cells at concentrations comparable with 5-aza-CdR. Detailed studies with
S110, a dinucleotide, showed that it works via a mechanism
similar to that of 5-aza-CdR after incorporation of its azamoiety into DNA. Stability of the triazine ring in aqueous
solution was not improved in the S110 dinucleotide; however,
deamination by cytidine deaminase was dramatically decreased. This is the first demonstration of the use of short
oligonucleotides to provide effective delivery and cellular
uptake of a nucleotide drug and protection from enzymatic
degradation. This approach may pave the way for more stable
and potent inhibitors of DNA methylation as well as provide
means for improving existing therapeutics. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Aberrations in DNA methylation are frequently observed in
various types of cancer (1–3). Several tumor suppressor genes or
cancer-related genes acquire de novo DNA methylation in
promoter or regulatory regions leading to inactivation, contributing to tumorigenesis (4–8). DNA hypermethylation can be reversed
by demethylating agents and crucial cellular functions reestablished in the cells. In recent years, the use of DNA methylation
inhibitors has become a promising alternative to patients with
myelodysplastic syndrome and hematologic malignancies (9, 10).
The most widely known examples of DNA methylation inhibitors
are 5-azacytidine (5-aza-CR) and 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine (5-azaCdR); both drugs were initially synthesized as anticancer agents
and were later shown to inhibit DNA methylation (11, 12). The
clinical use of nucleotides rather than nucleosides is essentially
impossible due to the negative charge on the phosphate group that

prevents effective cellular uptake. Thus, nucleoside analogues,
which are taken up intracellularly and phosphorylated to their
respective monophosphates, diphosphates, and triphosphates
before incorporation into replicating DNA, leading to covalent
trapping of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), are used (13). 5-AzaCR and 5-aza-CdR are powerful demethylating agents; nevertheless,
they have a number of drawbacks. The aza pyrimidine ring is
unstable in aqueous solution, making it difficult to administer, and
is quite toxic both in vitro and in vivo (14). Furthermore, the drugs
have transient effects, and DNA is gradually remethylated after
removal of the drug (15). Yet, another problem arises due to
cytidine deaminase, which renders the drugs inactive by converting
them into 5-azauridine compounds.
In our attempts to synthesize more stable and potent inhibitors
of DNA methylation, we found that short oligonucleotides
containing an azapyrimidine effectively inhibit DNA methylation
in living cells. Here, we focus on S110, a 5¶-AzapG-3¶ dinucleotide,
whose aqueous stability and toxicity are quite similar to that of
5-aza-CdR but is protected from deamination by cytidine
deaminase. The demethylating activity seems to require incorporation of the azapyrimidine into DNA presumably after degradation
of the oligonucleotide by phosphodiesterases and is not limited to
a dinucleotide but is seen in trinucleotides and tetranucleotides as
well, showing that short oligonucleotides are effective prodrugs for
delivery of inhibitors of DNA methylation. The utilization of short
oligonucleotides as nucleoside drug delivery vehicles that provides
protection against enzymatic degradation might have application
for delivery of other nucleoside drugs to cells.

Materials and Methods
Synthesis of oligonucleotides containing 5-aza-CdR. Dinucleotides,
trinucleotides, and tetranucleotides containing 5-aza-CdR were synthesized
by standard procedures with modifications to increase coupling times,
different oxidizing agents, and use of phenoxyacetyl decitabine phosphoramidite, instead of phenoxyacetyl cytidine phosphoramidite. A polystyrenebased solid support with loading of 240 Amol/g dG(pac) or D(pac) was used
(16, 17).
Briefly, synthesis of S53, 5¶-GpAza-3¶ dinucleotide, is described here.
Amersham ÄKTA Oligopilot 10 system was loaded with a protected
decitabine-linked CpG solid support (phenoxyacetyl protection of amino
function) and coupled with 2 to 2.5 equivalents of tert-butyl phenoxyacetyl
2¶-deoxyguanosine phosphoramidite in the presence of 60% of 0.3 mol/L
benzylthiotetrazole activator in acetonitrile for 2.5 min. The CpG solid
support containing protected S53 was treated with 20 mL of 50 mmol/L
K2CO3 in methanol for 1 h and 20 min. The coupled product was oxidized
with 2 mol/L tert-butylhydroperoxide in dry acetonitrile prepared by
dissolving tert-butylhydroperoxide in 80% tert-butylperoxide for 5 min. The
dimethoxy trityl protective group was removed with 3% dichloroacetic acid
in toluene. The CpG solid support was washed with dry methanol; the
filtrate was neutralized by addition of 2 mL of 1 mol/L acetic acid in
methanol. The solution was concentrated by rotary evaporation; the

residue was taken up in 200 mmol/L triethylammonium acetate (pH 6.9),
washed with 500 AL 50% aqueous acetonitrile, and filtered through a
syringe filter. S53 was subsequently purified to 95% purity by the ÄKTA
Explorer 100 high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a
Gemini C18 preparative column (Phenomenex), 250  21.2 mm, 10 Am
with guard column (Phenomenex), 50  21.2 mm, 10 Am, with 50 mmol/L
triethylammonium acetate (pH 7) in MilliQ water (Mobile Phase A) and
80% acetonitrile in MilliQ water (Mobile Phase B), with 2% to 20%/25%
Mobile Phase B in column volumes. The electrospray-mass spectrometry
(+) of triethylammonium salt of S53 exhibited m/z 556.1 [M-H] and
1,113.1 for [2M-H] , and the calculated exact mass for the neutral
compound C18H24N9O10P is 557.14.
Cytidine deaminase assay. Recombinant human cytidine deaminase
was kindly provided by Alberto Vita (University of Camerino, Italy) and
prepared as described in Vincenzetti et al. (18). Purified cytidine deaminase
(0.09–0.1 unit) was incubated with 0.2 mmol/L 5-aza-CdR or S110 in 3 mL of
0.1 mol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at 38jC. Percent substrate remaining was
measured after 45 and 90 min of incubation by a Waters 2695 HPLC system
with a 996 photodiode array detector (Waters Corp.).
Determination of nucleic acid stability. The absorbance of 5-aza-CdR
and S110 was measured with a Beckman DU Series 600 UV/visible
Spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). The wavelengths of maximum
absorbance of 5-aza-CdR and S110 were 241 and 245 nm, respectively. The
initial absorbance was measured immediately after 5-aza-CdR and S110
were dissolved in PBS, and both compounds were incubated at 37jC except
when absorbance reading was taken.
Cell lines and drug treatment. T24 bladder carcinoma cells and
HCT116 colon carcinoma cells were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection and cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated FCS, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL
streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a humidified incubator at 37jC in 5% CO2.
Cells were plated (1.5  105 per 60-mm dish) and treated 24 h later with
5-aza-CdR (Sigma-Aldrich) or S110 continuously for 6 days. Each compound
was dissolved in PBS. The medium was changed 3 days after the initial
treatment and supplemented with a fresh dose of 5-aza-CdR or S110.
Determination of cytotoxicity. A colony formation assay was used to
compare cytotoxicity of 5-aza-CdR and S110 as previously described (19).
Briefly, T24 cells were plated at a low density (100 per 60-mm dish) and
treated with varying concentrations of 5-aza-CdR and S110. Colonies were
allowed to form for 10 to 14 days, fixed with methanol, and stained with 10%
Giemsa. The number of colonies from an untreated control plate was used
to calculate the plating efficiency in percent at each concentration.
Triplicate dishes were used, and error bars are represented by 1 SD of the
mean.
Nucleic acid isolation. RNA was collected from T24 and HCT116 cells
with the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
DNA was collected using the DNeasy Tissue kit (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Total RNA (5 Ag)
was reverse transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random primers (Invitrogen). The reverse
transcription was carried out in a total volume of 50 AL as previously
described (4). The quantitation of mRNA levels was carried out by a realtime fluorescence detection method as described previously (15, 20). All
samples were normalized to the reference gene GAPDH. The primer and
probe sequences are as follows: for p16, sense 5¶-CTGCCCAACGCACCGA-3¶,
probe 5¶-6-FAM-TGGATCGGCCTCCGACCGTAACT-BHQ-1 3¶, and antisense
5¶-CGCTGCCCATCATCATGAC-3¶; for GAPDH , sense 5¶-TGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACGG-3¶, probe 5¶-6-FAM-TTTGGTCGTATTGGGCGCCTGG-BHQ1 3¶, and antisense 5¶-AGAGTTAAAAGCAGCCCTGGTG-3¶. The conditions
for real-time reverse transcription-PCR are 94jC for 9 min followed by
45 cycles at 94jC for 15 s and 60jC for 1 min.
Western blot analysis. Cell pellets were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer containing 0.1% SDS, 0.5% NP40, and 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate in PBS and incubated on ice for 30 min. The lysates were
centrifuged at 4jC for 30 min at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant was collected
and stored at 80jC. Approximately 60 Ag of protein was electrophoresed

on a Ready Gel Tris-HCl Gel, 4% to 15% linear gradient (Bio-Rad
Laboratories) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane
using Trans-Blot SD Semi-Dry Electrophoretic Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad
Laboratories). The membrane was hybridized with antibodies against
human DNMT1 (H-300; 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p16 (N-20; 1:500;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA;
PC10; 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in TBS-Tween (TBS-T) buffer
(0.01 mol/L Tris, 0.15 mol/L NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) with 5% nonfat dry
milk overnight at 4jC. The membranes were washed four times with TBS-T
buffer at room temperature and incubated with secondary antibodies for
1 h at room temperature. Secondary antibodies used were anti-rabbit-IgGhorseradish peroxidase (HRP) for DNMT1 and p16 (1:7,500; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) and anti-mouse-IgG-HRP for PCNA (1:7,500; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). The membranes were washed six times with TBS-T at room
temperature. Proteins were detected with the ECL Western Blotting
Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare Biosciences Corp.) and by exposure to
Kodak X-OMAT AR film.
Quantitation of DNA methylation. Genomic DNA (4 Ag) was treated
with sodium bisulfite as previously described (19). Methylation analysis
was done using the methylation-sensitive single-nucleotide primer
extension (Ms-SNuPE) assay for p16 5¶-region as previously described
(21). The PCR primers used were sense 5¶-TTTGAGGGATAGGGT-3¶ and
antisense 5¶-TCTAATAACCAACCAACCCCTCC-3¶. An initial denaturation
at 94jC for 3 min was followed by 94jC for 45 s, 62jC for 45 s, and 72jC
for 45 s for 40 cycles. Primers used for Ms-SNuPE analysis were
5¶-TTTTTTTGTTTGGAAAGATAT-3¶, 5¶-TTTTAGGGGTGTTATATT-3¶, and
5¶-GTAGAGTTTAGTT-3¶. Conditions for primer extension were 94jC for
1 min, 50jC for 30 s, and 72jC for 20 s. Methylation analysis of X58075
LINE-1 element was carried out with the following primer set. The PCR
primers were sense 5¶-TTTTTTGAGTTAGGTGTGGG-3¶ and antisense
5¶-CATCTCACTAAAAAATACCAAACAA-3¶, and the conditions were 94jC
for 3 min followed by 94jC for 45 s, 52jC for 45 s, and 72jC for 45 s for
39 cycles. Primers for Ms-SNuPE analysis were 5¶-GGGTGGGAGTGATT-3¶,
5¶-GAAAGGGAATTTTTTGATTTTTTG-3¶, and 5¶-TTTTTTAGGTGAGGTAATGTTT-3¶. Conditions for primer extension were 94jC for 1 min,
50jC for 30 s, and 72jC for 20 s.
In vitro hemimethylation assay. An intronic region of p16 was
amplified using human genomic DNA as a substrate and a primer set with
a methylated CpG to yield a hemimethylated CpG site. The amplicon (1 ng)
was treated with M.Sss1 or human DNMT1 (New England Biolab) in 50 AL
of reaction buffers, as recommended by the manufacturer, for 30 min at 37jC,
in the presence of S110 of various concentrations. The reaction was stopped
by heat inactivation of enzymes. Bisulfite-converted DNA was amplified by
5¶-CTCTTACCATCCTCTT-3¶ and 5¶-GAGTTATATTTATGTGATTATTTT-3¶,
and Ms-SNuPE assay was done using 5¶-TTTTAAAATTTTGTTAATAGTTTGAATT-3¶ as a primer.
Sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. Nuclei were prepared
according to the procedure described in Gal-Yam et al. (22). Briefly, cells
were trypsinized and washed once with PBS. The cells were then
resuspended in ice-cold RSB buffer [10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4),
10 mmol/L NaCl, 3 mmol/L MgCl2] containing Complete Mini proteinase
inhibitors (Roche) and kept on ice for 10 min before dounce homogenization with 0.5% NP40 to break up cell membranes. Nuclei were washed
twice with RSB plus proteinase inhibitors without the detergent. Purified
nuclei (1  108) were resuspended in 1 mL of RSB containing 0.25 mol/L
sucrose, 3 mmol/L CaCl2, and 100 Amol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
and digested with MNase (Worthington Biochemical Corp.) for 15 min at
37jC, and then the reaction was stopped with EDTA/EGTA (up to
10 mmol/L). After microcentrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 5 min, the nuclear
pellet was resuspended in 0.3 mL of the buffer [10 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4), 10 mmol/L NaCl] containing 5 mmol/L EDTA/EGTA, gently
rocked for 1 h at 4jC, and followed by microcentrifugation to obtain soluble
nucleosomes, which were then fractionated through a sucrose density
gradient solution [5-25% sucrose, 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.25 mmol/L
EDTA, 300 mmol/L NaCl] at 30,000 rpm for 16 h at 4jC. Fractions were
taken from the top of the centrifuge tube into 16 aliquots and subjected
to Western blot analysis.

Results
Reexpression of p16 in T24 bladder cancer cells by short
oligonucleotides. We first treated T24 cells with varying concentrations of oligonucleotides containing the 5-azapyrimidine ring for
6 days to test their abilities to induce the expression of the
methylation-silenced p16 gene in T24 bladder carcinoma cells
(Table 1). Induction of p16 is an indirect, yet straightforward,
method to detect inhibition of DNA methylation because
demethylation of the 5¶ CpG island of p16 results in reexpression
of the gene (4, 23). All short-chain nucleotides tested, regardless of
their chain lengths, were able to induce robust p16 expression with
the exception of S52R (Fig. 1B) and S112 (Fig. 1E), which induced
expression to lesser extents (Table 1). S52R, a phosphorothioate
derivative of S110 (Fig. 1B), is less prone to cleavage by
phosphodiesterases and caused a small induction of p16 at high
concentration, suggesting that the cleavage of the oligonucleotides
into nucleotides and nucleosides is a determining factor in
inducing gene expression. S112 is an S110 derivative with a
hexaethylene glycol phosphate linker at the 5¶-end (Fig. 1E), which
is subject to cleavage in cells. This extra cleavage requirement
probably slows down the ability of S112 to induce the p16 gene and
thus explains the weaker activity of the compound. Demethylation
of the 5¶-end of the p16 gene was observed in cells treated with the
short oligonucleotides, showing that indeed, these compounds are
bona fide inhibitors of DNA methylation (data not shown). From
here on, we focused our detailed characterization on S110 (Fig. 1D)
as an example of short oligonucleotide demethylating agents.
Effects of S110 on DNA methylation and p16 gene expression
in T24 and HCT116 cells. We extended on the initial screen done
in Table 1 to determine the dose dependency of S110 using T24
bladder and HCT116 colon cancer cells. First, we assessed global
methylation status by determining the methylation level of long
interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) sequences. Repetitive
DNA elements, such as LINE-1 retrotransposable elements, serve as
a useful marker of genome-wide methylation changes and have
previously been shown to be demethylated upon treatment with
5-aza-CdR (24). In both T24 and HCT116 cells, the decrease in the
level of methylation was dose dependent and comparable for 5-aza-

CdR and S110 after 0.1 and 1 Amol/L treatment (Fig. 2A, top). At
10 Amol/L concentrations, only a small decrease in methylation
was noted, probably due to side effects of high drug concentrations
as we observed previously (12). In fact, 10 Amol/L treatment may
be too cytotoxic for effective demethylation to take place as the
plating efficiency of T24 cells indicates. It is well established that its
cytotoxic dose is not ideal for optimal epigenetic therapy because
these drugs inhibit DNA methylation best at low doses in cell lines
as well as in the clinic (25, 26).
We then analyzed the DNA methylation status of exon 1 of the
p16 gene in these cells after 6-day treatment by quantitative MsSNuPE. In untreated T24 cells, the three CpG sites under analysis
are located in the first exon of the gene and are almost always fully
methylated. The methylation level decreased with increasing
concentrations of 5-aza-CdR or S110 in T24 cells (Fig. 2A, middle
left) and HCT116 cells (Fig. 2A, middle right) with the greatest
demethylation seen at 1 Amol/L 5-aza-CdR.
Next, we measured the expression of p16 in both cancer cell
lines. Untreated T24 bladder carcinoma cells do not express p16
and dose-dependent increases in p16 expression were observed
after 6 days of continuous treatment with 5-aza-CdR or S110
(Fig. 2A, bottom left). After HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells were
treated for 6 days, a dose-dependent increase in p16 expression was
observed with S110, whereas the highest p16 expression was seen
at 1 Amol/L dose of 5-aza-CdR (Fig. 2A, bottom right). In addition,
T24 and HCT116 cells treated with either agent for 3 days also
showed a dose-dependent increase in the level of p16 protein
(Fig. 2B), showing the competence of S110 to inhibit DNA
methylation and induce p16 at both mRNA and protein levels as
well as 5-aza-CdR. Thus, S110 is able to inhibit DNA methylation at
5¶-region and induce the expression of the p16 gene in T24 and
HCT116 cells at concentrations comparable to 5-aza-CdR, and the
induction of p16 expression by both agents correlated with the
demethylation at the 5¶-end region of the gene in both cell lines.
Depletion of DNMT1 levels by S110. To provide more clues to
the mechanism of action of S110, DNMT1 protein levels in T24 and
HCT116 cells treated with the compound were analyzed by
Western blot analysis (Fig. 2B). A number of studies have provided
evidence that incorporation of the azapyrimidine ring into DNA is
necessary for the drug to inhibit DNA methylation (13, 27, 28).
Work by Hurd et al. (29) showed a covalent bond formation
between a DNMT and zebularine-incorporated oligodeoxynucleotide, strengthening the notion that DNA incorporation is an
essential step toward inhibition of methylation by mechanismbased inhibitors. It is probable then that S110 works via a similar
mechanism and causes a depletion of extractable DNMT1 in cells.
Indeed, partial and complete depletion of DNMT1 protein was
observed in T24 and HCT116 cells treated with 5-aza-CdR for
3 days (Fig. 2B). Similarly, in S110-treated T24 and HCT116 cells,
partial depletion of the enzyme was seen at the 1 Amol/L dose, and
a trace of DNMT1 remained after 10 Amol/L treatment. Our results
suggest that S110 causes depletion of extractable DNMT1 in cells
and may work by a similar mechanism as that of 5-aza-CdR in
inhibiting DNA methylation.
Inhibition of DNMT1 in vitro by S110 and fractionation of
DNMT1 in nuclear extracts using sucrose density gradient
ultracentrifugation. To validate the notion that S110 works via
DNA incorporation after phosphodiesterase cleavage, we next
determined whether the dinucleotide could inhibit DNMTs in a
cell-free hemimethylation assay. We tested the ability of S110 to
inhibit a bacterial methylase, M.Sss1, or human DNMT1 activity to

methylate a double-stranded DNA containing a hemimethylated
CpG site. Figure 3A shows that both M.Sss1 and DNMT1 were able to
methylate DNA even in the presence of high concentrations of
S110. This result provided important clues to the mechanism of S110
by showing that the dinucleotide cannot inhibit DNMT1 directly.
Although Fig. 3A showed that the dinucleotide cannot directly
inhibit DNA methylation, we still lacked direct evidence that S110
metabolite had to be incorporated into DNA after cleavage. We
therefore extracted nuclei from 5-aza-CdR or S110-treated HCT116
cells, collected soluble nucleosomes, and size fractionated the
nucleosomes by sucrose density gradient centrifugation to
determine whether the drugs would trap DNMT1 on chromatin
(Fig. 3B and C). The absorbance showed that DNA is concentrated
in fractions 5 to 16 (Fig. 3B) as are the nucleosomes (Fig. 3C).
Under the salt concentrations used (300 mmol/L NaCl), DNMT1
was not associated with nucleosomes, and the majority of DNMT1
protein in untreated HCT116 cells was not bound to chromatin

(Fig. 3C). After 5-aza-CdR or S110 treatment, the distribution of
DNMT1 changed dramatically, and although the majority of the
enzyme was present in the low molecular portion of the gradient
( fractions 4 and 5), it was also found in fractions 6 to 16 along with
high molecular weight DNA (Fig. 3C). We interpret this result to
show that the incorporation of 5-aza-CdR or the hydrolyzed
product of S110 caused the DNMT1 enzyme to bind very strongly
to the DNA in chromatin. Our experiment strongly suggests that
S110 works through a similar mechanism as 5-aza-CdR after its
cleavage by phosphodiesterases, and that both 5-aza-CdR and S110
byproducts are incorporated into DNA where they covalently
interact with DNMTs. It is most probable that the S110
dinucleotide is cleaved into nucleotides and nucleosides because
incorporation of a dinucleotide or oligonucleotide is not known to
occur during DNA synthesis.

inhibits DNA methylation, we used S110 analogues (i.e., S53),
which is a reverse dinucleotide of S110, and S52R and S52S, which
are two optical isomers of phosphorothioate analogues of S110
(Fig. 1B and C). S53 would allow us to determine whether the
sequence of the dinucleotide plays a role in inhibiting DNA
methylation. In addition, the phosphorothioate analogues would
help us determine whether a free 5-aza-CdR is released from the
dinucleotide, or if S110 directly inhibits DNA methylation. The
phosphate backbones of phosphorothioate analogues S52R and
S52S are not readily cleaved, hence retaining the dinucleotide
structure for longer period of time. T24 cells were treated continuously for 6 days with these compounds at varying concentrations.
A dose-dependent induction of p16 and demethylation of p16
exon 1 were seen in T24 cells treated with S53, whereas the
expression and the DNA methylation status at the 5¶ end region
of p16 remained unaffected in cells treated with S52R and S52S
(Fig. 4A and B). Overall, this suggests that the order of bases in
the dinucleotide does not play a crucial role in inhibiting DNA
methylation, but the cleavage of the dinucleotide is critical in
rendering the compound active, suggesting once again that the
dinucleotide does not work as a whole and has to be cleaved into
individual nucleotides and nucleosides.
Stability of 5-aza-CdR and S110 at 37°C in neutral aqueous
solution. A drawback of 5-aza-CdR is its short half-life in aqueous
solution due to rapid hydrolysis of the azapyrimidine. To compare

the stability of S110 with that of 5-aza-CdR, we measured the
absorbance of 5-aza-CdR and S110 at their respective wavelengths
of maximum absorbance (k max) over time at 37jC in PBS solution
at pH 7.4. The absorbance of 5-aza-CdR showed a sharp decay in
the first 30 h of incubation with a half-life of about 20 h (Fig. 5A).
The half-life of S110 was 21 h, with 65% of its initial absorbance
remaining for as long as 200 h (Fig. 5A). This residual absorbance
at 245 nm is attributed to the guanosine ring in the dinucleotide,
the absorbance of which did not decrease during the course of the
experiment. In addition, the stability of both drugs was comparable
when monitored for 90 min at 38jC (pH 7.5) by HPLC (see Fig. 5B).
Furthermore, additional HPLC analysis of 5-aza-CdR and S110
stability at room temperature over time showed that both
compounds have similar half-lives (data not shown). Therefore,
whether the 5-azacytosine ring was in a single nucleotide or a
dinucleotide, the stability of the compound was not affected, and
the half-lives of these two compounds in aqueous solution at 37jC
remained the same.
Enzymatic degradation of 5-aza-CdR and S110 by human
cytidine deaminase. 5-aza-CdR is quickly catabolized into 5azadeoxyuridine by cytidine deaminase in vivo (30). We incubated
either 5-aza-CdR or S110 with human recombinant cytidine
deaminase at 38jC and measured the amount of substrate
remaining over time by HPLC (Fig. 5B). A slow decrease in the
total amount of 5-aza-CdR in the absence of cytidine deaminase

(E) over time is indicative of hydrolysis of the 5-azapyrimidine
ring in water. A rapid decrease in 5-aza-CdR was observed in the
first 45 min of incubation with human cytidine deaminase, and only
about 2% of the total substrate remained after 90 min (Fig. 5B, .). In
contrast, S110 was subject to hydrolytic cleavage as found earlier
(Fig. 5A) but was resistant to enzymatic degradation by cytidine
deaminase; the majority of S110 remained in the solution after
90 min of incubation with cytidine deaminase (Fig. 5B, x). Incubation of S110 in human plasma showed similar results, and the
dinucleotide persisted for 40 min with very little decrease when
measured by HPLC compared with a 33% decrease in the level of
5-aza-CdR (data not shown). Although the dinucleotide structure
cannot prevent the hydrolysis of the 5-azacytosine ring, it may
greatly lengthen the half-life of the drug by protecting it from
deamination, potentially increasing the efficacy of the drug in
patients as a result.

Cytotoxicity of 5-aza-CdR and S110 in T24 cells. Finally, we
compared the cytotoxicities of 5-aza-CdR and S110 in T24 bladder
carcinoma cells by measuring effects of the compounds on the
plating efficiency of T24 cells. 5-Aza-CdR decreased the plating
efficiency in a dose-dependent manner, with no colonies forming at
10 Amol/L concentration (Fig. 5C). S110 was slightly less toxic than
5-aza-CdR at the doses tested up to 1 Amol/L concentration but
displaying similar toxicity at 10 Amol/L concentration. Similar
results were obtained for HCT116 cells (data not shown). Thus, the
cytotoxicity of S110 as measured by plating efficiency is quite
similar to 5-aza-CdR in T24 cells.

Discussion
Short oligonucleotides were synthesized to test whether the
stability of 5-aza-CdR, a cancer chemotherapeutic agent, could be

the longer-chain oligonucleotides, further improving stability. In
practice, this may be very advantageous in terms of broadening the
applications of epigenetic therapy to patients with solid tumors.
Oligonucleotides have been widely studied as chemotherapeutics, and in most cases, the base sequence plays a pivotal role in
giving them therapeutic effects. For example, oligonucleotides with
CpG motifs activate toll-like receptors and elicit immune responses
(31). Antisense morpholino oligonucleotides and small interfering
RNAs all use sequence specificities of endogenous molecules to
inhibit either transcription or translation of target genes (32, 33).
Unlike the existing approaches, the short oligonucleotides we have
developed do not require any sequence specificities and simply
provide protection against enzymatic degradation before the DNA

reverse dinucleotide of S110, S52S, and S52R, and the phosphorothioate
analogues of S110 at varying concentrations continuously for 6 d and harvested
for RNA isolation (A). Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis
of p16 normalized against GAPDH . T24 cells treated with 5-aza-CdR, S53,

improved without compromising its potency to inhibit DNA
methylation. Comparison of the S110 dinucleotide containing
5-aza-CdR showed that S110 works via a similar mechanism of
action to the parent compound to inhibit DNA methylation, induce
expression of the p16 tumor suppressor gene, and inhibit tumor
cell growth (Figs. 2–5). Characterization of S110 showed that the
stability in aqueous solution and cytotoxicity is still comparable
with that of 5-aza-CdR; however, a major improvement was
accomplished in terms of resistance to enzymatic deamination
(Fig. 5B). Deamination of 5-aza-CdR by cytidine deaminase rapidly
depletes the plasma level of the drug, resulting in low bioavailability that has been frequently pointed out as one of the major
drawbacks of 5-aza-CdR (30). S110 dinucleotide is resistant to
cytidine deaminase deamination probably due to the substrate
specificity of the enzyme, which may potentially increase the halflife of the drug, enhance bioavailability, and make the drug more
efficacious. Lowering the dose requirement may also reduce the
toxicity in patients as well as diminishing common side effects of
5-aza-CdR, such as myelosuppression.
Trinucleotides and tetranucleotides containing one or more
5-aza-CdR residues in the chain showed demethylating activity as
well, showing that the cleavage of these oligonucleotides is extremely
efficient (Table 1; data not shown). Additionally, the hydrolytic
cleavage of the 5-azacytosine ring may presumably be improved in

incorporation of the active moiety following endonuclease and/or
phosphodiesterase cleavage. Our findings suggest that once these
prodrugs are delivered to the target site and taken up intracellularly, they are cleaved and metabolized to induce effects of similar
levels to the parent molecule. This concept eliminates the need for
chemical modifications such as lipid esterification and complex
delivery vehicles that are commonly required for prodrugs.
Although it is most likely that these oligonucleotides are cleaved
and incorporated into DNA to inhibit DNA methylation, it is still
not clear as to whether the cleavage occurs extracellularly or
intracellularly. It is not likely that the oligonucleotides are
processed into 5-aza-CdR or its nucleotide by DNases in plasma
before entering the cell because there is a little or weak
exonuclease activity in plasma, and endonucleases are known to
fragment DNA into larger pieces, thereby protecting the short
oligonucleotides from degradation (34–36). Furthermore, CpG
oligodeoxynucleotides must retain the CpG motifs to generate
immune response, which provides evidence that short oligonucleotides are not subject to nuclease degradation extracellularly (37). It
is probable then that the short oligonucleotide DNA methylation
inhibitors retain their structure when they enter the cell and are
only cleaved in the cells.
Oligonucleotides are thought to internalize themselves into cells
through both passive and active mechanisms (31). Much effort has
been devoted to expedite such uptake with liposomal encapsulation and peptide-mediated delivery of these oligonucleotides
(38, 39). Several membrane-bound proteins and receptors were
found to interact with oligonucleotides and facilitate their cellular
uptake (40–43). There are also speculations about cell surface
channel proteins that conduct nucleic acids and oligonucleotides
(44). Other transmembrane proteins are thought to cleave
phosphodiester and phosphosulfate bonds at the cell surface (45).
There are therefore many possible mechanisms by which short
oligonucleotides may enter the cell.
Once the oligonucleotides are internalized, they are probably
cleaved into individual nucleotides and nucleosides. The most

likely candidates for the cleavage of oligonucleotides are the 11
distinct subfamilies of phosphodiesterases that are abundant in all
cell types (46). Phosphodiesterases catalyze the hydrolysis of
3¶-ester bonds of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP into their respective
monophosphate moeities, leaving a phosphate group at the 5¶-end
(47, 48). It is probable then that these enzymes, when they process
the oligonucleotides, also leave the phosphate group on the 5¶-end
of the nucleoside in the sequence, hence yielding both nucleotides
and nucleosides. However, it is not clear from preliminary data
whether the phosphodiesterases are the main player involved in
processing these inhibitors, and further work is necessary to assess
their role in oligonucleotide metabolism.
Regardless of the mechanism, our data show that these short
oligonucleotides are quite efficient in entering the cell and
inhibiting DNA methylation. Dinucleotides, trinucleotides, or
tetranucleotides containing one or more 5-aza-CdR residues are
as effective as 5-aza-CdR in inducing p16 expression and
decreasing global methylation levels. These short-chain inhibitors
may be more resistant to cytidine deaminase degradation and be
particularly useful for clinical utility. We have therefore introduced a novel drug delivery system in which the oligonucleotides
are not restricted to their sequences for therapeutic potential and
provide protection against enzymes involved in the drug
metabolism. This may find numerous applications in delivering
5¶-phosphates to cells. In addition, other nucleoside drugs that are
subject to enzymatic degradation may benefit by using this
delivery method. The true merits of these short oligonucleotide
DNA methylation inhibitors may only be realized in a clinical
setting.
