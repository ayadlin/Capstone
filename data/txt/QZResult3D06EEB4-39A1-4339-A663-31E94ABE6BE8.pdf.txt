ABSTRACT
Macroautophagy can promote cellular survival or death depending on the cellular
context and its extent. We hypothesized that autophagy induction would synergize
with a therapeutic agent targeting the autophagic cargo. To test this hypothesis,
we treated breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells with tamoxifen (TMX), which induces
autophagy through an estrogen receptor-independent pathway. Induction of
autophagy reduced cellular levels of RRM2, a subunit of ribonucleotide reductase
(RR), the rate limiting enzyme in the production of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates
(dNTPs). This autophagy inducer was combined with COH29, an inhibitor developed
in our laboratory that targets RR through a novel mechanism. The combination
therapy showed synergistic effects on cytotoxicity in vitro and in an in vivo xenograft
model. This cytotoxicity was blocked by knockdown of the autophagy protein ATG5 or
addition of chloroquine, an autophagy inhibitor. The combined therapy also induced
dNTP depletion and massive genomic instability, leading us to hypothesize that
combining autophagy induction with RR inhibition can lead to mitotic catastrophe in
rapidly dividing cells. We propose that this TMX + COH29 combined therapy may have
clinical benefit. Furthermore, autophagy induction may be a general mechanism for
augmenting the effects of chemotherapeutic agents

functions [3, 4]. However, we and others have also shown
that prolonged starvation of arginine induces oxidative
stress and triggers autophagic cancer cell death [5, 6].
Third, necrosis is defined as a type of cell death that lacks
features of the two previous pathways and is accompanied
by swelling of the cell, loss of membrane integrity, and
inflammatory response, as the cellular contents are
released into the extracellular environment [1]. Cell
death pathways play important roles in tumorigenesis,
cancer progression, and resistance to therapy and thus are
important therapeutic targets in cancer [7].
One therapeutic approach is to induce an imbalance
of critical cellular components, leading to reduced
proliferation and death of the cancer cells. For instance,
deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTP) are required
building blocks for cells to carry out the basic functions
of DNA synthesis and repair. Thus, imbalanced levels
of dNTPs result in mutagenesis, genomic instability
and cell death [8]. The intracellular supply of dNTPs is
regulated by ribonucleotide reductase (RR), an enzyme
that catalyzes the formation of deoxyribonucleotides from

Cell death is an important process in cancer
therapy that occurs through three major pathways:
apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis - each of which can be
characterized by various morphological criteria [1]. First,
apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that involves
cell rounding, DNA fragmentation, and cell membrane
blebbing. Subsequent engulfment of apoptotic cells by
phagocytes prevents an inflammatory response to the dead
cells. Second, autophagy is a self-degradative pathway for
disposal of obsolete parts of the cell, is accompanied by
vacuolization in the cytoplasm and can lead to increased
cell survival or cell death depending on the type and extent
of self-degradation [2]. During autophagy, organelles
and parts of the cytoplasm are isolated in characteristic
double-membrane organelles known as autophagosomes.
Fusion of the autophagosomes with lysosomes can allow
for degradation and recycling as part of the quality
control process that maintains bioenergetics and basic cell

ribonucleotides, and plays a critical role in regulating
the total rate of DNA synthesis [9]. RR is also one of the
top 50 metabolic enzymes frequently overexpressed in
human tumors [10]. As a result, RR is a popular target
for anticancer agents such as RR inhibitors [11]. RR
consists of two protein subunits, RRM1 and RRM2, both
of which are required for enzymatic activity. Two RRM1
subunits and two RRM2 subunits join together to form
the active tetrameric enzyme. RRM1 and RRM2 are
encoded by different genes on separate chromosomes
and, most importantly, their messenger RNAs (mRNAs)
are differentially expressed throughout the cell cycle.
The cellular RRM1 protein level remains relatively stable
through the entire cell cycle and has a relatively long halflife of 18 to 24 h. In contrast, RRM2 is only expressed
during the late G1-/early S-phase when DNA replication
occurs, has a short half-life of 3 to 4 h, and is rapidly
degraded in late mitosis. Therefore, RR enzyme activity is
largely determined by the RRM2 protein levels in normal
cells.
We have identified a novel small molecule RR
inhibitor, COH29 that disrupts the interactions between
the hRRM1 and RRM2 subunits of human RR [12].
COH29 is an aromatically substituted thiazole compound
[N-(4-(3,4-dihyrophenyl)-5-phenylthiazol-2-yl)
-3,4-dihydroxybenzamide], which we developed from
a virtual screen of the National Cancer Institute (NCI)
Diversity Set with 2000 compounds (NCI2000). We
screened for the ability to bind a pocket on the surface of
the M2 subunit of RR, as predicted by protein structural
analysis [12]. Candidate compounds identified from this
screening were further optimized by iterative virtual and
structure activity relationship (SAR) analysis to yield
COH29. The aromatically substituted thiazole compound
binds to RRM2 and occupies a ligand-binding pocket on
hRRM2 that is positioned close to the hRRM1-hRRM2
interface. It thereby impedes formation of the holoenzyme
complex and inhibits RR activity. Unlike other RR
inhibitors, COH29 does not appear to chelate iron, so
side effects are likely to be reduced. Through interference
with DNA repair and replication pathways, COH29
upsets the balance of dNTP in cells, leading to cell death.
Because COH29 has limited effects as a single therapeutic
agent, we used various biochemical, cell biological, and
xenograft approaches to find a combination therapy that
reduced the toxicity and increased the efficacy of COH29.
Tamoxifen (TMX), a nonsteroidal estrogen-receptor
α (ERα) modulator, is a widely used therapeutic agent
for patients with ERα-positive breast cancers [13, 14].
TMX primarily functions by competing with estrogen
for binding to ERα, thereby inhibiting ERα activity
[15]. As a result, TMX is primarily used to reduce the
recurrence of ERα-positive breast tumors [16]. However,
results from both pre-clinical and clinical investigations
have demonstrated a beneficial effect of TMX on ERαnegative tumors or cancer cells [13, 17-21], suggesting
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that TMX can also act in an ERα-independent manner.
Along the same lines, in vitro studies have suggested that
TMX, besides inducing apoptosis in tumor cells, also
promotes the accumulation of large-scale autophagic
structures. These findings indicate that TMX may induce
cancer cell death through autophagy [22, 23]. The role of
autophagy in cancer cell death has been exploited by both
pharmacological and genetic approaches that modulate
autophagy [3, 24, 25]. Modulating autophagy requires
extra caution because autophagy can protect cancer cells
in the early stages of chemotherapy, but promote tumor
cell death afterwards [3, 24, 25]. Furthermore, autophagy
can be induced by various stimuli, including nutrient
deprivation, serum starvation, metabolic stress, radiation,
and anticancer drugs in multiple cancer cells [24, 26-29].
We propose to exploit autophagy-dependent cell death to
promote the efficacy of COH29-based cancer therapies.
Our previous study has shown that the regulation of
the dNTP pool and RRM2 levels are inversely related to
levels of autophagy [30]. In that report, reduced RRM2
abundance was associated with, increased autophagy
and a decreased intracellular dNTP pool. On the other
hand, overexpression of RRM2 or supplementation
of exogenous deoxyribonucleotide monophosphates
(dNMPs) to increase the intracellular dNTP levels
attenuated autophagy [30]. We hypothesized that adding
an autophagy inducer may boost the effectiveness of
COH29 by reducing the total levels of RRM2. Therefore,
we evaluated the effects of combining TMX with COH29
in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells both
in vitro and in vivo. We found that combined use of
TMX and COH29 reduced intracellular dNTP levels,
induced genomic instability, promoted tumor cell death,
and reduced tumor volume in a xenograft model. These
effects were dependent on autophagy. The effects of the
drug combination were far greater than the effects of
either drug alone. This study proposes an effective antitumor regimen and, more broadly, establishes aggressive
autophagy induction as a plausible method for increasing
the sensitivity of cells to chemotherapy.

RESULTS
Tamoxifen sensitizes breast cancer MDA-MB-231
cells to COH29 through autophagy induction
Based on our previous work [30], we hypothesized
that inducing autophagy would decrease RRM2 levels
and sensitize cancer cells to COH29, a novel RR inhibitor
[12, 31]. Consequently, we combined TMX, an autophagy
inducer, with COH29 in ERα-negative (ER-) breast cancer
cells and measured the resulting cytotoxicity [32, 33].
We transfected the cells with green fluorescent protein
(GFP) linked to the autophagosome marker microtubule

associated protein 1A/1B light chain (LC3). TMX
treatment induced autophagy in MDA-MB-231 cells
(Figure 1A, left panel), as evidenced by the accumulation
of GFP-LC3 puncta over time (Figure 1A, right panel).
Addition of TMX (10 µM) to the MDA-MB-231/GFPLC3 cells caused a significant decrease in GFP intensity
starting at 24 h post-treatment, whereas treatment with
a lower concentration of TMX (5 µM) needed up to 48
h to render a significant decrease (Figure 1B). These
results suggested that TMX treatment induces autophagy
in MDA-MB-231 cells in a concentration- and timedependent manner.
Western analyses were used to monitor the protein
abundances of RRM2, LC3 and p62/SQSTM1, another
autophagy marker, in breast cancer cells treated with TMX
for 24 and 48 h. Consistently, TMX decreased RRM2
abundance in several breast cancer cell lines including
MDA-MB-231, MCF7 and T47D, regardless of their
ERα status (Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure S1A).
However, TMX had no effect on RRM2 abundance in
autophagy-deficient ATG5-knockdown MDA-MB-231
(MDA-MB-231/shATG5) cells (Figure 1C). We also
used western analysis to measure the autophagy-induced
lipidation of LC3. As expected, LC3 lipidation increased
(appearance of LC3-II) and p62/SQSTM1 abundance
decreased in response to TMX, but accumulated in
the presence of bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), a potent and
selective inhibitor of vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase)
that prevents the autophagic degradation via lysosomes
[34, 35]. This result further supports a model where
TMX induces autophagy. The effect of BafA1 observed
in MDA-MB-231/shATG5 was due to the incomplete
knockdown of ATG5 (Figure 1C, right panel).
Next, we hypothesized that the TMX-induced,
autophagy-mediated RRM2 downregulation sensitizes
MDA-MB-231 cells to anti-RR agents, such as
COH29. To test this possibility, MDA-MB-231 cells
were maintained with the increasing concentrations of
COH29 -in the presence or absence of TMX for 72 h.
Cell viability was determined using acid phosphatase
(ACP) assays at 72 h post-treatment (Figure 1D). As
expected, the combination treatment was more effective
at reducing cell viability than COH29 alone. The IC50
for COH29 is approximately 35 µM and 17 µM in the
presence and absence of TMX, respectively (Figure 1D).
We further confirmed that the combination treatment also
resulted in autophagy induction by analyzing GFP-LC3
puncta formation (Figure 1E, upper panel). The combined
treatment with COH29 did not affect the ability of TMX
to induce autophagy (Figure 1E, lower panel). Moreover,
TMX induced RRM2 reduction was also observed in
the ERα-positive breast cancer T47D and MCF7 cells
(Supplementary Figure S1A), suggesting that it is not
breast cancer subtype is specific. Along the same line, a
dose-dependent cytotoxic effect by the combination of
COH29 and TMX was also noted in T47D and MCF7
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells (Supplementary Figure S1B). However, the nontumorigenic mammary MCF-10A cells were less sensitive
to the combined treatment (Supplementary Figure S1B).
We have previously shown that rapamycin decreased
RRM2 level in an autophagy-dependent manner in KB
cells [30]. Here, we further demonstrated that rapamycin
(10 µM) also sensitized MDA-MB-231 cells to COH29
treatment by reducing RRM2 expression (Supplementary
Figures S2A and S2B). The involvement of autophagy
in promoting COH29 cytotoxicity was further examined
in the context of arginine deprivation with arginine
deiminase (ADI, 0.2 µg/ml), known to induce rapamycinindependent autophagy [6], and comparable results
were observed (Supplementary Figures S2C and S2D).
Together, these results support a model where autophagy
induction, through TMX, sensitizes cancer cells to
COH29-induced cell death.

The synergistic effects of COH29 + tamoxifen
combination are autophagy-dependent
To explore the mechanism underlying the improved
efficacy of combining TMX with COH29, MDAMB-231 and MDA-MB-231/shATG5 cells were treated
with the combination of COH29 and TMX. Figure 2A
reveals that MDA-MB-231 cells were more sensitive
to treatment than their isogenic autophagy-deficient
(ATG5-knockdown) counterparts, suggesting that the
combinatorial effect of TMX and COH29 was autophagydependent (Figure 2A). The viability data was further
analyzed by Compusyn software to determine whether the
drugs showed synergistic effects. The combination index
(CI) for the combination in MDA-MB-231 was 0.18,
indicating a synergistic effect, whereas the CI was 1.53
in MDA-MB-231/shATG5 cells, suggesting no evidence
of synergy (Figure 2B). To further confirm the synergistic
effect is autophagy-dependent, knockdown of BECLIN1
or ATG5, a key molecule for autophagy induction, also
conferred a pro-survival effect, like in the context of
combined treatment (Supplementary Figure S1C). Next
we determined if the combined inhibitory effect was
autophagy-dependent by using an autophagy inhibitor,
chloroquine (CQ). The cells were treated with TMX and
COH29, as indicated, in the presence and absence of CQ
(20 µM). The addition of CQ resulted in a significant
rescue of cell viability in cells treated with 10 or 20 µM
each of TMX and COH29 (Figure 2C). Moreover, pretreatment with TMX for 24 h to induce autophagy notably
enhanced the cytotoxicity induced by TMX and COH29
(20 µM each). Consistently, the enhanced cytotoxic effect
of sequential treatment was also retarded by CQ addition
(Figure 2C).
Next, we tested the hypothesis that reduced RRM2
levels would deplete intracellular dNTP pools. We
measured the dNTP pools in treated cells, and found that

COH29 alone significantly decreased dCTP and dTTP
abundance to 50% at 48 h post-treatment; however, the
combined treatment showed a comparable effect at 24h
(Figure 2D). At 48 h after the combined treatment, all of
the dNTP pools, including dCTP, dTTP, dATP and dGTP,
were reduced to less than 25% of the control (Figure 2D).
Likewise, Western analyses revealed that TMX-induced
LC3-II accumulation and RRM2 reduction were retarded
by knocking-down ATG5 (Figure 2E). Although, the
expression of RRM1 was not affected, the abundance of
RRM2 is more reduced by the combination of TMX and
COH, which was consistent with the cytotoxicity data
shown in Figure 2A. These results support our overall
hypothesis that decreasing RR level decreases intracellular
dNTP abundance.
Lastly, we investigated the possibility that other cell
death pathways were activated by the combined treatment.
To study the contribution of apoptosis to the cell death,
MDAMB231 and MDAMB231/shATG5 cells were treated
with a combination of TMX and COH29 for 24 and 48
h. The percentage of Annexin V-positive (early apoptotic)
and/or PI-positive (dead) cells was determined by flow
cytometry. The low percentage of cells undergoing early
apoptosis suggested that apoptosis could not completely
account for the observed death (Supplementary Figure
S3A). Western analyses further supported this finding
by showing that the majority of caspase 3 remained
inactivated (not cleaved) (Supplementary Figure S3B).
Taken together, our results support the conclusion that the
combined use of TMX and COH promoted cytotoxicity by
autophagy induction.

individually, did not reduce tumor growth (Figure 3C).
Immunohistochemistry staining (IHC) of Ki67, a cellular
marker for proliferation, was performed to assess tumor
cell growth or not. The staining indicated that less Ki67
signals were detected in xenografted tumor cells from mice
receiving the combined treatment of TMX and COH29
(Supplementary Figure S4A), consist with the significant
reduction of tumor weights among four treatment groups
(Figure 3C). Altogether, our results clearly show that
TMX and COH29 have anti-tumor effects both in vitro
and in vivo and suggest that autophagy is required for the
combinatorial effect.
Next, the tumor samples were stained with antiRRM2 and -Ki67 antibodies, respectively (Figure 3D
and Supplementary Figure S4A). The percentage of antiRRM2 positive cells per 500 cells in 2 tumor samples was
enumerated. Figure 3D reveals that the nuclear RRM2
abundance was slightly reduced in the TMX-only group,
unchanged in the COH29-only group, and markedly
decreased in the group treated with TMX+COH29. As
expected, the TMX+COH29 treatment only slightly
reduced RRM2 abundance in tumors derived from
autophagy-impaired MDA-MB-231/shATG5 cells (Figure
3D). These results were validated by Western analyses
using protein samples extracted from the indicated tumors
(Supplementary Figure S4B). In autophagy-competent
MDA-MB-231-derived tumors, RRM1 abundance was
not affected by the treatments, whereas RRM2 levels
were reduced by combined treatment. Although we
were unable to detect LC3-II, the LC3-I level decreased
in TMX and became almost undetectable in the group
received combined treatment, whereas unlipidated LC3
was notably visible in MDA-MB-231/shATG5-derived
samples (Supplementary Figure S4B).

Next, we used an orthotopic tumor model and treated
the tumor-bearing mice with vehicle, TMX, COH29 or
the combination. MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-231/
shATG5 cells were implanted into the mammary glands
of NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) (NOD-SCID)
mice to form solid tumors and randomly divided into
six groups with 5 mice each for the indicated treatments.
Tumors were harvested at day 17 post-treatment and
evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining.
Figure 3A shows the differences in tumor size among
the groups. The tumor volume was recorded twice a
week and plotted as shown in Figure 3B. The autophagycompetent, xenografted tumors showed significantly less
growth in the presence of the combined TMX and COH29
treatment, relative to vehicle alone (Figure 3B) and also
showed a reduced weight at the time of harvest (Figure
3C). However, consistent with Supplementary Figure
S1C, the combined treatment had no effect on tumors
from ATG5-knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 3B).
Furthermore, TMX and COH29 treatment, when delivered

In order to investigate the mechanism underlying
breast cancer cell death by combined treatment with
COH29 and TMX, fluorescence microscopy was used to
examine the nuclear dynamics. As shown in Figure 4A,
one striking feature was that COH29 treatment induced
nuclear DNA leakage, as identified by DAPI-positive
particles outside the nucleus, and the leaked DNA puncta
were notably larger than micronuclei [36]. Furthermore,
co-treatment with TMX enhanced the DNA leakage
(Figure 4A). Lamins A and C, a structure that surrounds
the nucleus, are the scaffolding components of the nuclear
envelope in cells [37]. Notable features of this phenotype
are a non-disrupted nuclear shape and an intact nuclear
membrane, as shown by lamin A/C staining (Figure 4B).
Intriguingly, some of the leaked DNAs were within laminlabeled structures (Figure 4B). Because dNTP depletion
is known to induce genomic instability, we next wished

more abundant γH2AX signal with extended duration was
detected in combination-treated cells. It has been shown
that autophagy plays a role in DNA damage response
by cleaning up damaged DNAs [38-40]. As anticipated,

knockdown of ATG5 induced a higher basal level of the
basal γH2AX level in MDA-MB-231/shATG5 cells prior
to COH29 or TMX treatment, and there was no significant
increase of γH2AX level after treatment (Supplementary

In order to investigate the potential genomic
instability induced by the combined of COH29 + TMX
treatment, MDA-MB-231 cells undergoing various
treatments were subjected to cytogenetic analysis
(Figure 5). Serving a control, vehicle-treated MDAMB-231 cells showed an abnormal female karyotype
with hyperdiploid and near tetraploid populations. The
cells were characterized by structural abnormalities
involving chromosomes X, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 13, 15, 16, 18, and 21. Clonal numerical gains of
chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 10, 11, and 15 were detected, as
well as clonal losses of chromosome 21 (Figure 5A). The
near tetraploid sideline cells contained duplicate copies
of most stemline abnormalities. Using vehicle-treated
MDA-MB-231 cells as a reference, we investigated the
effects of drug treatment. A subset of the COH29-treated
cells (5/20) showed increases in genomic instability,
including increases in chromosome and chromatid breaks
and gaps, whereas TMX treated cells did not show any
increased genomic instability (Figure. 5B and 5C). In the
cells co-treated TMX and COH29 for 24 h, the overall
chromosomal morphology was significantly worse than
that in vehicle-treated cells and chromosomal breakage
was apparent in approximately 35% of the cells (Figure
5D). At 48 h after combined treatment, chromosome and
chromatid breaks and gaps were observed in almost all
cells. In addition, all cells undergoing combined treatment
for 48 h were arrested in metaphase, accompanied by
shorter chromosome length and loss of chromosomes
(Figure 5E). Taken together, these results suggested that
COH29 treatment induced DNA damage, resulting in DNA
leakage, which was markedly aggravated by combination
with TMX.  

approved for human cancer clinical use) and triapine
[47], interact with the RRM2 subunit and inhibit RR
activity. However, these small molecules have problems
that limit their use, including lack of specificity for the
RRM2 protein, unwanted side effects, and susceptibility
to resistance. For instance, HU blocks DNA synthesis by
reducing the tyrosyl free radical of the RRM2 subunit to
a normal tyrosine residue but is susceptible to resistance.
Furthermore, 3-AP (triapine®), which was in human phase
II clinical testing, relies on iron chelation to inactivate RR.
Data from a phase I trial of 3-AP showed that patients
developed side effects such as hypoxia, respiratory
distress, and methemoglobulin, due to chelation of iron
in the patients’ red blood cells [48]. Therefore, approach
to improve efficacy of existing RRM2 inhibitor or
development of new RRM2 inhibitors are needed [49].
The reciprocal regulation of autophagy and the
dNTP pool has been observed and reported in human
cancer cells [28]. In this report, we have demonstrated
that the ER-independent effect of TMX, autophagy
induction, sensitizes ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells to
COH29, via RRM2 reduction. Studies on the combination
of TMX with other agents, such as TRAIL [50] and
rapamycin [51], have shown synergistic apoptotic activity.
Although the concept of combined TMX with TRAIL
therapy is worthwhile, the therapeutic use of TRAIL
is limited by concerns over its potential hepatotoxicity
[52, 53]. Currently, TMX is associated with depression,
endometrial hyperplasia, and Coumadin drug interaction.
COH29 causes hematologic toxicity, such as anemia,
thrombocytopenia, and leukemia. Theoretically, the side
effects from the combination of TMX and COH29 should
not exceed their respective adverse effect.
Two different ubiquitin ligases are known to exert
tight control over the steady-state levels of RRM2 in the
G1- and G2-phases of cell cycle. During G1-phase, APC/
CCdh1, a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase complex,
targets RRM2 for degradation [54]. During G2-phase,
cyclin F controls the degradation of RRM2 [55]. In
this report, we found that besides ubiquitin-mediated
degradation of RRM2, the abundance of RRM2 was
regulated by lysosomal degradation through autophagy
induction. As shown in Figures. 1C and 2C, the
pretreatment of TMX (to induce autophagy) effectively
reduced RRM2 level and sensitized cells to COH29.
Moreover, the addition of BafA1, an autophagy inhibitor,
blocked the decrease of RRM2 after autophagy induction
by TMX, rapamycin and arginine depletion (Figure 1C,
Supplementary Figs. S2A and S2C). All these suggest
that autophagy-dependent lysosomal degradation plays a
critical role in controlling RRM2 level in breast cancer
cells. However, the underlying mechanism of how
autophagy recognized RRM2 for degradation is still
unclear and additional study is warranted. Although, we
cannot rule out the possibility that increase in COH29mediated cytotoxicity is due to increased drug intake via

DISCUSSION
RR inhibitors, first introduced into clinic near 60
years ago, are widely used in cancer therapy. The use of
RR inhibitors as anti-cancer agents has been reviewed by
Shao and colleagues [11, 41]. Because rapidly dividing
tumor cells have an increased need for dNTPs, they are
far more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of RR inhibition
than normal cells. In addition, a growing body of evidence
is showing that RRM2 is overexpressed in cancer and is
associated with neoplasia, metastatic potential, and poor
prognosis in human cancers [42-44].
60 years after the introduction of RR inhibitors into
clinical oncology, their mechanism of action in human
tumors is becoming increasingly clear. RR is a unique
enzyme that utilizes free radicals to drive catalysis in a
mechanism that involves components in both the RRM1
and RRM2 subunits [45, 46]. The RRM1 subunit contains
the active site and substrate specificity sites, whereas the
RRM2 subunit contains the oxygen-linked diferric iron
center and tyrosyl radical. Numerous small molecule
inhibitors, such as hydroxyurea (HU), gemcitabine (both

autophagy, we postulated that TMX-induced aggressive
autophagy promotes the death of COH29-treated cells.
This possibility is supported by the observation that some
of the leaked DNAs were within lamin-labeled structures
(Figure 4B), consistent with the report by GonzalezSuarez et al. that loss-of-lamin A affects the ability of cells
to properly repair DNA damage and maintain genome
integrity [56].
Anti-mitotic agents have wide-ranging therapeutic
potential for the treatment of various types of cancers
[57, 58] and there has been a great deal of interest in
identifying novel mitotic inhibitors that can overcome
the various modes of resistance and promote improved
pharmacological profiles [59]. A previous report
demonstrated that knockdown RRM2 and the addition of
cisplatin induces inter- and intra-strand DNA crosslinks
[60]. Also, a recent report from us showed that loss of
RRM2b causes chromosomal instability and chromatid
breakage in mice [61]. These findings showed that RRM2
plays a crucial role in maintaining chromosomal stability,
suggesting that modulation of cellular RRM2 abundance
may be important for the induction of mitotic cell death.
We propose that autophagic degradation of a RRM2,
the target of COH29, promotes cell death, whereas in
other contexts autophagy can protect cancer cells from
death [62, 63]. Why does autophagy promote tumor
cell survival in some circumstances and death in other
circumstances? One possible explanation relates to what
autophagy is degrading in each specific circumstance. For
example, starvation- or rapamycin-induced autophagy had
been shown to decrease RRM2 level and accompanied by
a decrease in RNR activity and dNTP pools in human
cancer cells [30]. In our study, we showed that COH29
along can induce cell death through inhibiting RR activity,
and its cytotoxicity is dramatic enhanced when autophagy
is induced by TMX, even though the cells are normally
resistant to TMX. In summary, the present findings
indicate that combination of TMX and COH29 effectively
reduces cell viability in MDA-MB-231 cells via an
autophagy-dependent pathway. Furthermore, our data
suggest that autophagy induction may serve as an adjuvant
anticancer therapy, and that proper combined treatment
with an autophagy inducer could synergistically enhance
the therapeutic efficacy of a myriad of cancer treatments.

Cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays
Many cytotoxicity assays are dependent on
mitochondrial function and can generate artifacts if
mitochondrial function is impaired without cell death.
Therefor, ACP assays, which measures cellular acid
phosphatase activity, were used to avoid the effects of
mitochondria dysfunction. Between 2,500 and 5,000
cells were seeded onto 96-well plates. Cells were treated
with TMX, COH or the combination at the indicated
concentrations for 72 h. At the end of the time period,
cells were washed twice with PBS then incubated at 37
°C for 30 min with 100 µl of pNPP solution composed of
pNPP (5 mM) in a buffer containing sodium acetate (0.1
M) and Triton X-100 (0.1% (v/v), pH 5.5). The reaction
was terminated by adding NaOH (1 N, 10 µl), and the
absorbance was measured at 410 nm using a microplate
reader. The interaction between drug combinations was
analyzed using the Calcusyn software program (Biosoft,
Cambridge, UK) to determine if the combination was
antagonistic, additive or synergistic. This program is
based on the Chou-Talalay method to calculate a CI, and
CI values below 1 indicate synergistic effect. The CIs
were determined from cell viability ACP assays as the
fraction of cells killed by individual drugs, or combination
of drugs, compared to vehicle-treated cells. For the
apoptosis assay, cells were treated with COH29 and
TMX for the indicated time periods. After trypsinization,
cells were washed twice with cold PBS and collected by
centrifugation at 1000 rpm. Cells were then resuspended
in 1 x Binding Buffer at a concentration of 1 x 106 cells/

and dTTP assay) or [3H]dTTP (for dATP assay), and 0.2
units of Sequenase (2.0) (Affymetrix, 70775Y). After
reacting at room temperature (RT) for 20 min, 40 µl of
the aliquots were applied to circular Whatman DE81 ion
exchange paper (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, 3658-325).
The papers were dried, then washed 3 x 10 min with 5%
Na2HPO4, and rinsed once with distilled water and once
more with 95% ethanol. After each paper was dried and
deposited in a small test tube, and 5 ml of Ecoscint A was
added to each tube. Tritium-labeled dNTPs were counted
in a liquid scintillation counter and compared to a standard
sample prepared in the presence of 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and
1.0 pmol/ml of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP each.

Whole-cell Extracts and Immunoblotting
Cells treated with TMX, COH or combination
treatment were harvested at the end of incubation
period and lysed on ice for 30 min in RIPA buffer (Cell
Signaling, #9806) containing a complete protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche, 11836145001) and PhosSTOP (Roche,
04906837001). The Qproteome Mammalian Protein Prep
Kit (Qiagen) was used to extract protein from harvested
tumors. The protein concentrations were determined
using a Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, 500-0001).
Approximately 40 µg of protein was mixed with an equal
volume of 2 x SDS loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, then
separated by Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE and transferred to
PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5%
nonfat milk in PBST (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20)
and incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight.
The membranes were then washed with three times with
PBST for 10 min, and incubated with HRP (horseradish
peroxidase)-labeled secondary antibodies for 2 h at RT.
Immunoblots were visualized using the VersaDoc 5000
imaging system (Bio-Rad) and processed using quantity
one (Bio-Rad).

Microscopy
MDA-MB-231/GFP-LC3 cells were cultured in sixwell plates with cover slips at a density of 1 x 105 cells/
well, and then treated with TMX, COH or the combination
for the indicated time points. After washing with PBS,
the cover slips were mounted over a microscope slide
in Prolong anti-fade reagent that contained DAPI (Life
Technologies, P-36931), and examined using a Olympus
AX70 upright microscope (Olympus).

Xenograft studies
For tumorigenesis, 5 × 106 MDA-MB-231 and
MDA-MB-231/sh-ATG5 cells (resuspended in 100 µl
serum-free DMEM media) were used for orthotopic
implantation of six-week-old female NOD.CgPrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) (NOD-SCID) mice. Mice
were randomized at day 10 after tumor inoculation and
received vehicle, an approximate total dose of 30 mg/kg
of COH29, 80 mg/kg of TMX, or the combination therapy
daily for 17 days (n = 5 per group). The tumor volume was
measured twice every week. Tumors were harvested for
weight measurement and H&E, RRM2 and Ki67 staining.
All animal experiments were approved by the institutional
animal care and use committee at City of Hope.

Isolating dNTPs
1 × 106 cell pellets were harvested and added to 100
µl of 15% trichloroacetic acid. Alternatively, 50 mg of
tumor samples were added to 100 µl of 15% trichloroacetic
acid. The solution was mixed and homogenized using a
TissueLyser (Qiagen) for 1 min then kept on ice for 10
min. Then the mixture was centrifuged for 5min, and the
supernatant fractions were saved and extracted with 2 x 50
µl aliquots of 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane/trioctylamine
(55:45; Sigma-Aldrich,270369, and T81000). After each
centrifugation, the supernatant was saved. 5 µl aliquots of
each sample were used to check the dATP, dCTP, dGTP,
and dTTP concentrations. The remainder was stored at -80
°C for further assays.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Ki67 and RRM2 protein levels in the tumor samples
harvest from mouse were assessed by IHC using antiKi67 (1:100 dilution) and anti-RRM2 antibodies (1:75
dilution). Briefly, after de-paraffinization, endogenous
peroxidase activity was blocked by pre-treatment with
3% H2O2. The slides were incubated with normal goat
serum for 20 min at RT to block non-specific signal, then
incubated with the primary antibody for 20 min at RT.
The slides were then incubated with polymer horseradish
peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies for 30 min at RT,

dNTP pool assay
This assay was conducted according to the method
of Sherman and Fyfe. The total reaction volume was 50
