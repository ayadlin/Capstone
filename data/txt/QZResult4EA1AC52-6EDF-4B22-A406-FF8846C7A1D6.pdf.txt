ABSTRACT
We have used an unbiased proteomic profiling strategy to identify new potential
therapeutic targets in tumor-initiating cells (TICs), a.k.a., cancer stem cells (CSCs).
Towards this end, the proteomes of mammospheres from two breast cancer cell
lines were directly compared to attached monolayer cells. This allowed us to
identify proteins that were highly over-expressed in CSCs and/or progenitor cells.
We focused on ribosomal proteins and protein folding chaperones, since they were
markedly over-expressed in mammospheres. Overall, we identified >80 molecules
specifically associated with protein synthesis that were commonly upregulated in
mammospheres. Most of these proteins were also transcriptionally upregulated in
human breast cancer cells in vivo, providing evidence for their potential clinical
relevance. As such, increased mRNA translation could provide a novel mechanism
for enhancing the proliferative clonal expansion of TICs. The proteomic findings
were functionally validated using known inhibitors of protein synthesis, via three
independent approaches. For example, puromycin (which mimics the structure of
tRNAs and competitively inhibits protein synthesis) preferentially targeted CSCs in
both mammospheres and monolayer cultures, and was ~10-fold more potent for
eradicating TICs, than “bulk” cancer cells. In addition, rapamycin, which inhibits
mTOR and hence protein synthesis, was very effective at reducing mammosphere
formation, at nanomolar concentrations. Finally, mammosphere formation was also
markedly inhibited by methionine restriction, which mimics the positive effects of
caloric restriction in cultured cells. Remarkably, mammosphere formation was >18fold more sensitive to methionine restriction and replacement, as directly compared to
monolayer cell proliferation. Methionine is absolutely required for protein synthesis,
since every protein sequence starts with a methionine residue. Thus, the proliferation
and survival of CSCs is very sensitive to the inhibition of protein synthesis, using
multiple independent approaches. Our findings have important clinical implications,
since they may also explain the positive therapeutic effects of PI3-kinase inhibitors
and AKT inhibitors, as they ultimately converge on mTOR signaling and would block
protein synthesis. We conclude that inhibition of mRNA translation by pharmacological
or protein/methionine restriction may be effective strategies for eliminating TICs. Our

tumor growth, by targeting protein synthesis in anabolic tumor-initiating cancer cells.

INTRODUCTION

for DNA damage repair and this now seems to be the most
likely mechanism of radio- and chemo-resistance [14,
15]. Several studies have now shown that typical DNA
damaging chemotherapeutic agents can even cause an
upregulation of stem cell transcription factors and a direct
conversion of cancer non-stem cells (bulk cells) into TICs,
potentially increasing the TIC burden in patients rather
than reducing it [16-19]. Thus, specifically targeting TIC
populations in approaches that circumvent their resistance
to DNA damaging therapy is a promising strategy for
future cancer treatment.
To begin to understand the phenotypic behavior
of TICs at a molecular level, we prepared large numbers
of mammospheres from two different ER(+) breast
cancer lines (MCF7 & T47D). The mammospheres were
subjected to unbiased proteomic profiling to decipher
their molecular composition and metabolic characteristics
compared to the cells grown in monolayer. Based on
proteomics analysis, we observed that mammospheres
significantly upregulate molecules associated with protein
synthesis, including ribosome-related proteins and proteinfolding chaperones, as well as specific molecules involved
in mRNA translation initiation, polypeptide elongation,
tRNA synthesis and amino acid uptake. We speculate that
TICs are highly anabolic and increase their capacity for
protein synthesis, to drive their clonal expansion via cell
proliferation. Treatment with well-established inhibitors
of protein synthesis (puromycin, rapamycin or methionine
restriction) directly validated that mammosphere
formation is strictly dependent on nacent protein synthesis.
Thus, our results may also explain the anti-cancer health
benefits of caloric restriction, intermittent fasting and the
vegetarian diet, by systemically reducing protein synthesis
in TICs.
Currently, there is a tremendous need to identify
a selective “Achilles’ Heel” to eliminate TICs. Our new
results highlight that TICs are especially functionally
dependent on augmented protein synthesis, for their
successful survival and continued propagation. This study
provides a strong rationale for therapeutically targeting
protein synthesis in the CSC population.

Tumor-initiating cells (TICs) are known to be
resistant to many conventional therapies, and have been
implicated in disease recurrence and metastatic spread
[1-3]. Residual TICs are linked to poor patient survival
in multiple tumor types. As TICs are extremely rare and
represent only a small fraction of the total cancer cell
population, we still know very little about what allows
them to survive and propagate, especially under the harsh
conditions associated with chemo- and radio-therapy [17].
Remarkably, TICs are thought to pheno-copy
many of the characteristics of normal epithelial stem
cells, such as immortalization, asymmetric cell division
and resistance to stressors, such as DNA damage [2, 3,
7]. Hence, the term cancer stem cells (CSCs) is now
used virtually interchangeably with TICs [1-7]. Another
hallmark of epithelial TICs is their ability to grow under
anchorage-independent conditions, when cultured using
low-attachment plates [8]. Under these anchorageindependent growth conditions, CSCs/TICs spontaneously
form 3D spheroid structures or “tumor-spheres”, that
retain stem-like or progenitor cell properties. Conversely,
under cell suspension conditions, most non-TICs undergo
a form of apoptotic cell death, known as “anoikis”. It has
been shown that each tumor-sphere is derived directly
from the proliferative clonal expansion of a single TIC,
and not from the aggregation of bulk cancer cells [8].
Furthermore, the enriched TIC population is more resistant
to radiotherapy, showing enhanced DNA damage repair
and lower levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [9].
As such, the preparation of tumor-spheres represents an
efficient and convenient method to selectively enrich for
TICs. When these tumor-spheres are specifically generated
from primary breast cancer cells or cell lines, they are
known as “mammospheres”.
Several mechanisms have been proposed to
explain the increased resistance of TICs to clinical
treatments. Firstly, both radiotherapy and the majority
of chemotherapeutic treatments target rapidly dividing
cells and it has been proposed that the resistance of
TICs was due to them having a quiescent slow-cycling
phenotype [10]. However, it has since been demonstrated
that CSCs (at least in breast cancer) do cycle and their
resistance to stress is not simply a function of quiescence
[11, 12]. Furthermore, CSCs have a greater capacity to
efflux chemotoxins due to an increased expression of
ABC transporters possibly explaining their additional
resistance to chemotoxins but obviously these cannot
account radio-resistance [13]. CSCs have been shown to
be resistance to apoptotic stimuli compared to their nonstem cell counter parts and to have an increased capacity

RESULTS
Greater than 70 ribosomal protein components, as
well as an isoform of S6 Kinase (RPS6KB1), are
upregulated in mammospheres
First, we performed unbiased label-free proteomic
analysis on MCF7 cells, a commonly used ER-positive
breast cancer cell line. Table 1 shows a non-redundant list

of the 72 ribosome-related proteins that were selectively
upregulated in MCF7 mammospheres, as directly
compared with MCF7 cells derived from monolayers.
Only proteins with a fold increase of ~1.5 or greater were
selected for this analysis. Note that the expression levels
of 21 large ribosomal proteins and 15 small ribosomal
proteins were increased, as compared with monolayer
cultures. Similarly, two large mitochondrial-specific
ribosomal proteins were increased. A specific-isoform of
ribosomal S6 kinase was also elevated (RPS6KB1) nearly
15-fold. Finally, 34 proteins involved in mRNA translation
initiation, polypeptide elongation, tRNA synthesis and

amino acid uptake, were all selectively upregulated in
MCF7 mammospheres.
For comparison purposes, we also performed
unbiased label-free proteomic analysis on a second
independent ER-positive breast cancer cell line, namely
T47D cells. Our results are summarized in Table 2.
Note that 64 ribosome-related proteins were specifically
over-expressed in T47D mammospheres, as compared
with T47D monolayer cultures processed in parallel.
Remarkably, 57 of these proteins overlapped with the
proteins that were upregulated in MCF7 mammospheres
(57/64 = 89% overlap). See the Venn diagram presented
in Figure 1.

and amino acid uptake.

a puromycylated-peptide, which is prematurely released. As such, puromycin inhibits protein synthesis via a premature chain termination
mechanism.

Heat shock proteins (HSPs)/protein-folding
chaperones are upregulated in MCF7 and T47D
mammospheres

and mammosphere formation was completed abolished at
0.5 µg/ml.
In striking contrast, monolayer MCF7 cells were
~10 times less sensitive to the effects of puromycin.
Puromycin reduced both the i) proliferation and ii)
viability of monolayer MCF7 cells, with an IC-50 of ~
0.5 µg/ml, a concentration 10-times higher than the IC50 for mammosphere formation (Figure 4). In addition,
mammosphere formation was inhibited by >70% at a
concentration of 0.1 µg/ml; this same concentration had
no effect on the viability of monolayer MCF7 cells.
In addition, when monolayer MCF7 cells were pretreated with puromycin for 4 days and then trypsinized
and plated for mammosphere assays (in the absence
of puromycin), mammosphere forming activity was
completely eliminated by puromycin pre-treatment at 0.5
µg/ml (Figure 5). At this same concentration, ~50% of
monolayer MCF7 cells still remain viable and proliferate
(Figure 4). This indicates that protein synthesis inhibitors
can preferentially target TICs, even in the presence
of adjacent non-TIC cells, in the setting of an attached
monolayer.
Thus, we conclude that TICs/CSCs are clearly more
sensitive to the functional effects of inhibiting protein
synthesis, directly supporting the results of our unbiased
proteomics analysis.

Heat shock proteins are important for proper protein
folding during protein synthesis. Table 3 shows a list of
13 heat shock proteins that were selectively upregulated
in MCF7 mammospheres, relative to MCF7 monolayers.
Note that 2 of these heat shock proteins are mitochondrialspecific chaperones (HSPA9 and HSPD1). Similarly, 11
heat shock proteins were specifically over-expressed in
T47D mammospheres, as compared with T47D monolayer
cultures processed in parallel (Table 4). Importantly, all
eleven proteins overlapped with the proteins that were
upregulated in MCF7 mammospheres (11/11 = 100%
overlap). See the Venn diagram presented in Figure 2.
Taken together, our results predict that protein
synthesis may be critical for the survival and propagation
of cancer stem cells and/or progenitor cells.

Functional effects of puromycin, a known
inhibitor of protein synthesis, on mammosphere
formation.
Next, to functionally validate the hypothesis
that mammosphere formation strictly requires protein
synthesis, we used a highly-specific inhibitor that mimics
the nucleotide-polypeptide linkage that occurs in tRNAs,
namely puromycin [20]. By mimicking the structure
of tRNAs, puromycin competitively inhibits protein
synthesis. Also, puromycin is physically transferred to the
growing polypeptide chain, leading to the generation of
puromycylated-peptides, which are prematurely released
(Figure 3). Thus, puromycin inhibits protein synthesis via
a premature chain termination mechanism [20].
Figure 4 shows the effects of increasing
concentrations of puromycin on mammosphere
formation, using an ER-positive breast cancer cell line
(MCF7). Importantly, puromycin significantly reduced
mammosphere formation, with an IC-50 of ~ 0.05 µg/ml

Functional effects of rapamycin and methionine
restriction on mammosphere formation
To further validate that mammosphere formation
is functionally dependent on protein synthesis, we next
used a well-established FDA-approved drug that potently
inhibits protein synthesis, namely rapamycin [21-23].
Figure 6 shows the effects of increasing concentrations
of rapamycin on mammosphere formation. Note that
rapamycin significantly reduces mammosphere formation
in MCF7 cells, with an IC-50 < 100 nM.
Complementary results were obtained with
methionine restriction. Methionine is absolutely required
for protein synthesis, since every new protein sequence

starts with a methionine residue [24-26]. Note that
mammosphere formation was dramatically inhibited by
methionine deprivation (Figure 7), which mimics the
positive effects of caloric restriction in cultured cells.
Importantly, mammosphere formation was functionally
restored to normal levels by the dose-dependent readdition of methionine to the methionine-free culture
media, with maximal effects occurring at 0.01 mM
(10 µM). It should be noted that mammosphere media
normally contains 0.1 mM methionine (100 µM).
Remarkably, mammosphere formation appeared to
be >18-times more sensitive to the effects of methionine
deprivation and replacement, when compared directly with
MCF7 cell monolayers (Figure 7). More specifically, the
re-addition of 0.001 mM methionine stimulated MCF7
mammosphere formation by 22-fold; in contrast, the
same concentration of methionine only stimulated MCF7
monolayer proliferation by 1.2-fold (Figure 7). Similar
results were also obtained at higher concentrations of
methionine (0.01 and 0.1 mM), with mammospheres again

showing a >10-fold increase relative to monolayers.
In addition, MCF7 cell monolayers were pretreated with methionine at different concentrations (0,
0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 mM) for 4 days and then trypsinized
and re-plated for mammosphere assays (in the presence
of normal levels of methionine (0.1 mM)). Under
these conditions, mammosphere-forming activity was
significantly reduced by up to 3-fold (Figure 8; compare
0 vs. 0.1 mM). Importantly, methionine restriction did not
affect MCF7 monolayer viability (as seen in Figure 7).
Thus, methionine restriction is also effective at reducing
“stemness” in the context of MCF7 cell monolayers.
Therefore, pharmacological inhibition of protein
synthesis and methionine depletion (as a mimetic
of caloric restriction) may be effective strategies for
eliminating cancer stem cells [22-28].

Figure 7: Methionine restriction significantly reduces mammosphere formation in MCF7 cells. Note that mammosphere
formation was dramatically inhibited by methionine deprivation. Importantly, mammosphere formation was functionally restored to normal
levels by the dose-dependent re-addition of methionine to the methionine-free culture media, with maximal effects occurring at 0.01 mM
(10 µM). Mammosphere media normally contains 0.1 mM (100 µM). Parallel experiments with MCF7 cells grown as monolayer cultures
are shown for comparison. Interestingly, mammosphere growth is 10-to18-fold more sensitive to the effects of methionine-restriction and
replacement. (*)p <0.05.

human breast cancers

targets were also upregulated either in MCF7 and/or T47D
mammospheres. As such, the new protein targets that we
identified in mammospheres may be especially relevant
for improving human breast cancer diagnosis and therapy.

To assess the clinical relevance of our results, we
also determined whether the proteomic targets that we
identified in mammospheres were transcriptionally overexpressed in human breast cancer cells in vivo. Towards
this end, we exploited a clinical data set of tumor samples
from 28 breast cancer patients [29, 30]. These tumor
samples were subjected to laser-capture micro-dissection,
to separate epithelial cancer cells from adjacent stroma.
Tables 5 and 6 present a summary of these findings.
Overall, 60 proteomic targets that we identified in
mammospheres were also transcriptionally elevated in
human breast cancer cells in vivo and the majority of these

DISCUSSION
Here, using unbiased label-free proteomics analysis,
we show that the cells of mammospheres (a population
which is enriched for TICs and other progenitor cells)
functionally overexpress numerous proteins, related to
protein synthesis, including ribosomal biogenesis, mRNA
translation initiation, polypeptide elongation, tRNA
synthesis, amino acid uptake and protein folding. The
potential clinical relevance of these targets was further
validated using a previously published data set of human

and then trypsinized and re-plated for mammosphere assays (in the presence of normal levels of methionine (0.1 mM)). Note that under
these conditions, mammosphere-forming activity was significantly reduced by up to 3-fold (compare 0 vs. 0.1 mM). As such, methionine

breast cancer samples (N=28 patients), that were subjected
to laser-capture microdissection, to separate the epithelial
tumor cells from the adjacent tumor stroma. Thus, these
novel anabolic targets reveal a metabolic “Achilles’ Heel”
to allow the elimination of CSCs. In accordance with
this idea, we demonstrate that the therapeutic targeting
of protein synthesis in mammospheres (via puromycin,
rapamycin or methionine-restriction) is indeed sufficient
to prevent their proliferative expansion, as assessed
using mammosphere formation as a functional assay
(summarized schematically in Figure 9). In accordance

with our results, a recent paper has shown that the mTOR
inhibitor Torin-1 selectively targets human colon CSCs
[31].
Recently, we also reported that mitochondrial
oxidative metabolism is also markedly amplified in
mammospheres, as evidenced by i) unbiased proteomics
analysis and ii) functional validation with inhibitors
of mitochondrial OXPHOS [32]. Thus, enhanced
mitochondrial energy production could help directly “fuel”
increased protein synthesis in CSCs, thereby driving and
maintaining the anabolic phenotype of TICs (Figure 10).

Figure 9: Anabolic tumor-initiating cells require protein synthesis for clonal expansion. Activation of the PI3-kinase/AKT/

mTOR signaling pathway is known to converge on ribosomal biogenesis and protein synthesis. Thus, the therapeutic effects of PI3-kinase
inhibitors and AKT inhibitors, may be explained by their ability to inhibit mTOR signaling and block protein synthesis in TICs. Similarly,
direct pharmacological inhibition of protein synthesis and/or caloric restriction or protein restriction may have similar beneficial therapeutic
effects. Thus, our current data provide a novel convergent mechanism by which inhibitors of PI3-kinase, AKT, mTOR, as well as caloric
restriction, may all directly target tumor-initiating cells, by inhibiting protein synthesis.

Figure 10: Augmented mitochondrial OXPHOS may help fuel increased protein synthesis. Recently, we showed that
mitochondrial oxidative metabolism is significantly amplified in mammospheres, as evidenced by i) unbiased proteomics analysis and
ii) functional validation with inhibitors of mitochondrial OXPHOS. As such, enhanced mitochondrial energy production could help
directly “fuel” increased protein synthesis in CSCs, thereby driving and maintaining the anabolic phenotype of TICs. Thus, inhibition of
mitochondrial function and protein synthesis may both be beneficial.

Deregulation of protein synthesis

of methionine also reduces proliferation and increases
apoptosis of embryonal stem cells (ESC) whilst
apparently not affecting more differentiated cells [53].
ESC can be induced to form differentiated cardiac cells
and a methionine free medium can be used to remove
remaining ESCs which, if transplanted with cardiac cells
form teratomas [54]. Our data is the first suggestion that
epithelial TICs may be similarly sensitive to methionine
depletion. It is well known that tumor cell lines and
primary tumors in-vitro and when grown in-vivo in rodents
are growth inhibited by methionine depletion whereas
normal cells are unresponsive. Methionine restriction
(MR) was shown to reduce the growth of sarcomas [55,
56] [57], adenocarcinomas [25, 58] and mammary tumors
in rodents [59], as well as of human tumor cell lines [60],
human primary tumors in-vitro [61] and tumor growth in
nude mice [62, 63].
Low methionine diets in rodents produce similar
effects as calorie restriction [64]. Tumor formation and
tumor growth is reduced and lifespan is increased although
MR does not appear as potent as calorie restriction
or general protein restriction [26]. MR may produce
longevity effects, in part, acting through reduction of the
formation of free radicals in mitochondria [64, 65] and, in
part, by inhibition of protein synthesis in precursor cells
as demonstrated in this report. Also, methionine restriction
increases the stress tolerance of human fibroblasts, reduces
senescence and increases their doubling time [66, 67]. In
mammals, the effect of MR appears to be growth hormone
dependent [68].
Vegans and vegetarians have relatively low intakes
of methionine compared with meat eaters and some but
not all recent studies suggest that vegans have lower
cancer and cardiovascular disease risk [69-71]. It has been
suggested that low-methionine vegan diets may be used as
a feasible approach for life extension [72]. Ornish and his
colleagues [73] were able to show that the concentration
of prostate specific antigen (PSA) was reduced in men
with prostate cancer treated only with lifestyle changes,
which included a vegan diet and exercise. A recent phase
I study demonstrated that methionine restriction was well
tolerated for up to 17 weeks in patients with various solid
tumors [74].

Deregulation of protein synthesis is a relatively
unexplored but emerging mechanism of cancer
progression. Two of the better documented examples
of this phenomenon are increased protein synthesis as
a result of c-MYC and mTOR oncogenic signaling.
Although better known for targeting genes involved in
cell cycle regulation, it has been known for some time
that c-MYC directly targets multiple components of the
translational machinery including: RNA polymerases
I, II and III; ribosomal proteins; translation initiation
factors; elongation factors; and rRNA [33-38]. Until
more recently, the consequence and importance of this
protein synthesis up regulation has remained unknown
and the complexity and breadth of c-MYC targets has
made it a difficult question to address [39]. Specific
ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency (L24+/− and L38+/−)
have recently helped to address the role of c-MYC
induced protein synthesis [40]. It was thus demonstrated
ribosomal protein haploinsufficiency is able to rescue mice
from increased rates of protein synthesis downstream of
oncogenic Eμ-Myc signaling. In these mice, the growth
of Myc-overexpressing B cells was returned to normal
and remarkably this was coupled with the restoration of
cell division rates to near wild-type levels [40]. These
results imply that c-MYC directly couples cell growth
and cell division, at least in part, by a deregulation of
protein synthesis. Furthermore, the oncogenic potential
of c-MYC was strongly impaired by ribosomal protein
haploinsufficiency genetic backgrounds, with the onset
of lymphomas being dramatically delayed Eμ-Myc;L24+/−
and Eμ-Myc;L38+/− mice compared to Eμ-Myc [40]. This
may be due to an increase in the apoptotic response to
Myc oncogenic activity observed with ribosomal protein
haplo-insufficiency genetic backgrounds.
Unlike c-MYC, the oncogenic mTOR signaling
pathway is readily associated with the control of protein
synthesis, targeting mRNA translation and ribosome
biogenesis [41-48]. The signaling cascade initiates
with PI3-kinase producing phosphatidylinositol-3,4bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate
which act as second messages or as docking sites for the
serine/threonine kinase Akt [49]. Recruitment of Akt to
PI3-kinase products allows Akt-phosphorylation and thus
activated, by the kinase PDK1. Activated Akt subsequently
targets mTOR, in turn promoting translation via the
activation of p70 S6 kinase (S6K) and the initiation factor
4E [50, 51]. S6K phosphorylates ribosomal protein S6 and
promotes the translation of translational machinery [52].

CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, based on our current analysis using
mammosphere cultures, we propose that inhibition
of protein synthesis is a new therapeutic strategy for
eradicating TICs, to potentially prevent tumor recurrence,
metastasis and poor clinical outcome in breast cancer
patients. This strategy might also be extended to other
tumor types, as many of the phenotypic features of TICs
are highly conserved between different epithelial cancer
types.

to as percentage mammosphere formation, and was
normalized to one (1 = 100 %MSF). All mammosphere
experiments were performed in triplicate, three times
independently, such that each data point represents the
average of 9 replicates.

Materials
Breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and T47D) were
purchased from the ATCC. Puromycin, rapamycin,
methionine and methionine-free media were obtained
commercially from Sigma-Aldrich. Gibco-brand cell
culture media (DMEM/F12) was purchased from Life
Technologies.

Methionine restriction and replacement
For methionine restriction experiments, DMEM-F12
was replaced with methionine-free DMEM (Gibco,
#21013-24) and supplemented with 30mg/L cysteine
(Sigma, #C7352-25G).

Monolayer culture

Label-free quantitative proteomics analysis

50,000 cells were plated in normal medium
(DMEM, 10% FCS, L-glutamine, supplemented with
Pen-Strep) for 24hr, followed by treatment with increasing
concentrations of a specific inhibitor (puromycin) or
nutrient (methionine) for a further 4 days. Cells were
then collected by trypsinization and centrifugation. To
quantitatively determine cell growth, the number of cells
after dtreatment was counted using an automatic cell
counter (Biorad) and differences compared to untreated
cells was calculated and expressed as fold-change. To
assess cell viability, cells were incubated for 1 minute
with Trypan Blue (Sigma, #T8145) using a 1:1 ratio. The
number of Trypan Blue positive cells (non-viable) was
measured using an automatic cell counter (Biorad) and
compared to untreated controls. For puromycin treatments,
cells were also plated into mammosphere culture to assess
stem cell-like activity with no further drug treatment. All
monolayer experiments were performed in triplicate, three
times independently, such that each data point represents
the average of 9 replicates.

For proteomic analysis, mammospheres were
collected by centrifugation at 800 rpm for 10 minutes. Cell
lysates were prepared for trypsin digestion by sequential
reduction of disulphide bonds with TCEP and alkylation
with MMTS [32]. Then, the peptides were extracted and
prepared for LC-MS/MS. All LC-MS/MS analyses were
performed on an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer
(Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) coupled to an Ultimate
3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Scientific, formerly
Dionex, The Netherlands). Xcalibur raw data files
acquired on the LTQ-Orbitrap XL were directly imported
into Progenesis LCMS software (Waters Corp., Milford,
MA, formerly Non-linear dynamics, Newcastle upon
Tyne, UK) for peak detection and alignment. Data were
analyzed using the Mascot search engine. Five replicates
were analyzed for each sample type (N = 5). Statistical
analyses were performed using ANOVA and only foldchanges in proteins with a p-value less than 0.05 were
considered significant.

Mammosphere culture

Data mining

To directly assess the effects of specific inhibitors
(puromycin/rapamycin) or nutrients (methionine) on
mammosphere formation, cultures were supplemented
with increasing concentrations of puromycin, rapamycin
or methionine, as indicated in a given experiment. A
single cell suspension was prepared using enzymatic (1x
Trypsin-EDTA, Sigma Aldrich, #T3924), and manual
disaggregation (25 gauge needle) to create a single cell
suspension [8, 32]. Cells were plated at a density of
500 cells/cm2 in mammosphere medium (DMEM-F12/
B27/20ng/ml EGF/PenStrep) in non-adherent conditions,
in culture dishes coated with (2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate)
(poly-HEMA, Sigma, #P3932). Cells were grown for 4-to5 days and maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C
at an atmospheric pressure in 5% (v/v) carbon dioxide/air.
After 5 days for culture, spheres >50 µm were counted
using an eye piece graticule, and the percentage of cells

To firmly establish the clinical relevance of our
results from the quantitative proteomics analysis of
mammospheres, we re-analyzed the transcriptional
profiles of epithelial breast cancer cells and adjacent tumor
stromal cells that were physically separated by lasercapture microdissection (from N=28 human breast cancer
patients) [29, 30].
