ABSTRACT
The expression of annexin A2 (ANXA2) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells
induces the immunosuppressive response in dendritic cells; however, the oncogenic
effect and clinical significance of ANXA2 have not been fully investigated in NPC cells.
Immunohistochemical staining for ANXA2 was performed in 61 patients and the
association with clinicopathological status was determined. Short hairpin (sh)RNA
knockdown of ANXA2 was used to examine cellular effects of ANXA2, by investigating
alterations in cell proliferation, migration, invasion, adhesion, tube-formation assay, and
chemo- and radiosensitivity assays were performed. RT-qPCR, Western blotting, and
immunofluorescence were applied to determine molecular expression levels. Clinical
association studies showed that the expression of ANXA2 was significantly correlated with
metastasis (p = 0.0326) and poor survival (p = 0.0256). Silencing of ANXA2 suppressed
the abilities of cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, invasion, and vascular formation
in NPC cell. ANXA2 up-regulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition associated signal
proteins. Moreover, ANXA2 reduced sensitivities to irradiation and chemotherapeutic
drugs. These results define ANXA2 as a novel prognostic factor for malignant processes,
and it can serve as a molecular target of therapeutic interventions for NPC.

and neck carcinomas in terms of epidemiology, clinical
presentations, biological markers, carcinogenic risk
factors, prognostic factors, and treatment, and also in its
near consistent association with the Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) and a high incidence of metastasis [3, 4]. Currently
available clinical therapies for NPC are radiotherapy,
chemotherapy, and a combination of the two. Although
there is a good efficiency of cure with early-stage NPC
patients using radiotherapy (RT) alone, those in the late
stage and with distant metastatic spread are difficult to
cure [5]. Recently, immunotherapy has been extensively
studied in NPC, and immunotherapeutic strategies focused
on EBV-induced NPC using an adenoviral vector-based
vaccine [6] or EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes
(EBV-CTLs) to suppress tumor progression [7, 8].
Besides CTLs, other studies also indicated the functions
of dendritic cells (DCs) in cancer immunotherapy such
as the tumor infiltrating DCs reflect on the prognosis
and survival in NPC [9–11]. Through NPC cells and
DCs interaction, DC functions are also inhibited by
a ligand, called annexin A2 (ANXA2), which allows
NPC cells to escape from immune surveillance [12].
An immunosuppressive reaction might be the main way
through which NPC escapes from attack by immune cells.
Therefore, we propose that ANXA2 may be a therapeutic
target in NPC.
Annexins constitute a family of at least 20 different
calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding proteins that
up-regulating cellular growth and signal transduction
pathways. ANXA2 exists as both a monomer and a
bivalent heterotetramer. The membrane form of ANXA2
is a heterotetramer (two molecules each of annexin A2
and S100A10). S100A10, also called p11, combines with
plasminogen. Plasminogen can be cleaved into plasmin,
which activates pro-matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) into
active MMPs. MMPs are associated with the invasive
ability by degrading the cell matrix. The cytosolic form of
ANXA2 is a monomer. The ANXA2 monomer participates
in some molecular mechanisms when it is phosphorylated
and enters nuclei [13]. ANXA2 has been proven to
stimulate the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis
of cancers, including ovarian, hepatocellular, glioma,
pancreatic, and breast cancers [14–18]. However, the
knowledge of functions of ANXA2 in NPC is very limited.
In the present study, we investigated the tumorigenic
functions of ANXA2 in NPC. We found that silencing
ANXA2 reduced various malignant phenotypes as
demonstrated by cell proliferative, migratory, invasive,
and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) properties,
and increased chemo- and radiosensitivity. The potential
effects of ANXA2-knockdown in xenograft tumor-bearing
mice and the significance of the clinical pathology were
evaluated. Results of these experiments revealed that
ANXA2 provides a foundation for studying potential
clinical applications in the prognosis or as a therapeutic
target in NPC.

Clinicopathologic correlations with ANXA2
expression
To investigate the clinical significance of ANXA2,
specimens from 61 patients with NPC were obtained for
this study. ANXA2 expression levels were examined by
IHC and measured by H-score. As to the expression of
ANXA2 in NPC, 22 (36.06%) of 61 primary specimens
were stained positively for ANXA2. A representative
example of different staining results of ANXA2 is shown
in Figure 1A. Determination of positive or negative
reaction was based on whether H-score was higher
or lower than 50 point. The statistical significance of
ANXA2 was analyzed in regard to the clinical data,
including age, sex, histologic types by Chi-squared test.
There were no statistical correlations of ANXA2 levels
with gender (p = 0.811) or age (p = 0.871), but there
were statistical correlations with metastasis (p = 0.0326)
(Figure 1B). The association of ANXA2 expression and
patient overall survival was examined using the KaplanMeier method with a log-rank test. As shown in Figure 1C,
positive of ANXA2 was associated with a poor prognosis
(p = 0.0256), in primary NPC patients.

Knockdown of ANXA2 inhibits cell proliferation
in NPC cell lines
To evaluate the cellular functions of ANXA2,
two stable ANXA2-specific knockdown cell lines
were established after transduction of shRNA targeting
ANXA2 into the TW01 and BM1 NPC cell lines.
Messenger (m)RNA expressions of TW01-717 and
TW01-781 were respectively reduced 70% and
86%, while those of BM1- 717 and BM1-781 were
respectively reduced 75% and 87% (Figure 2A). Protein
expression levels of TW01-717 and TW01-781 were
respectively reduced 50% and 64%, while those of
BM1-717 and BM1-781 were respectively reduced
70% and 80% (Figure 2B). The efficiencies of shRNA
knockdown were similar between the TW01 and BM1
cell lines. Stable ANXA2-knockdown cells were used
in subsequent cellular studies. Silencing of ANXA2
suppressed cell proliferation in TW01-717 and 781 cells
by 78% and 63%, respectively, on day 2, and similar
effects were also observed in BM1 cells (Figure 2C).
Our data suggested that suppression of ANXA2 could
reduce cell proliferation in both NPC cell lines. To
investigate the effects of ANXA2 knockdown on tumor
growth in vivo, we established xenograft NPC tumors
in NOD/SCID mice. ANXA2-knockdown NPC in mice
showed significant growth arrest compared to the controls.
On average, the 781 cell group exhibited 50% decreased
tumor growth on day 21 (p = 0.001) (Figure 2D). Tumor
tissues were confirmed by H&E staining (Figure 2E), and

to verify that the tumor growth rate was influenced by
ANXA2 knockdown, the xenograft tumors were dissected
to examine ANXA2 expression by IHC. As shown in
Figure 2E, the ANXA2 protein was reduced in the 781
cell group compared to the scrambled control group.
The results indicated that ANXA2 promoted tumor cell
proliferation both in vivo and in vivo and suggested that

at decreasing oncogenesis.

in stable ANXA2-knockdown cells. Compared to the
scrambled control, the cell migration ability decreased
70% (717) and 55% (781) in TW01 cells, and the same
effect was also observed in BM1 cells (Figure 3A). The
vascular formation ability decreased to 20% (717) and
15% (781) in TW01 cells, and 60% (717) and 10% (781)

Matrigel assay are shown in Figure 3C. The invasive
abilities decreased 50% in 717 cells and 75% in 781 cells
after 12 h compared to scrambled control cells (p < 0.01).
Moreover, an anti-ANXA2 antibody also suppressed the
cell invasive ability (Figure 3C). Lastly, we also observed
whether ANXA2 regulates the cell adhesive ability in
NPC. After 2 h of cell culture, 75% of scrambled cells had

that ANXA2 knockdown inhibited the cell adhesion

any difference on the treatment efficiency after silencing
of ANXA2. We separated cells into two groups: one was
given chemotherapeutic drugs (cisplatin or 5-FU) before
irradiation. The other group was given chemotherapeutic
drugs after irradiation. The results showed that more
NPC cells were killed when NPC cells were exposed to
irradiation before treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs
after silencing of ANXA2 (Figure 5F). Thus, the order of
chemotherapy and radiotherapy is important for treatment
effects.

Expression of ANXA2 induces the EMT by
activating the transforming growth factor
(TGF)-β pathway
Since silencing of ANXA2 reduced cell migration,
invasion, and adhesion abilities, we therefore investigated
whether ANXA2 also participated in the EMT process in
NPC cells. We used TGF-β, known as an EMT stimulus,
to reinforce the transition speed. Indeed, scrambled cells
(with high ANXA2 expression) exhibited increased cell
scattering when treated with 10 ng/ml TGF-β for 24 h
(Figure 4A). E-cadherin and N-cadherin expression levels
were confirmed by immunofluorescence. Higher levels of
the mesenchymal marker, N-cadherin, and lower levels
of the epithelial marker, E-cadherin, were expressed in
scrambled control cells, but the phenomenon was reversed
after silencing of ANXA2 (Figure 4B). Moreover, Western
blotting confirmed that E-cadherin and N-cadherin
expression levels showed consistent results (Figure 4C).
In terms of the EMT signal pathway, silencing of ANXA2
produced a decrease in TGF-β-induced Snail/Twist
expression level in NPC cells (Figure 4D).

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first report to
investigate the potential clinicopathologies, functions
and molecular mechanisms of ANXA2 in NPC. ANXA2
is upregulated in several cancers and is associated
with metastasis [14–18]. There are very few studies on
ANXA2 in NPC so far. A proteomics comparison that
analyzed an EBV-associated NPC cell line (C666–1)
and normal nasopharyngeal cell line (NP69) showed that
ANXA2 was downregulated in the NPC cell line and
found that cytoplasmic staining, complete and incomplete
membrane staining, and both cytoplasmic and membrane
staining were all lost in clinical tissues [19]. However,
our studies showed that ANXA2 is associated with the
clinicopathological status of NPC from patients’ tissues.
Those previous results were opposite to our findings, and
we inferred that this might have been due to different types
of NPC tissues or the EBV-infection status. We collected
different types of NPC tissues, but the previous report had
limited samples of an undifferentiated type of NPC tissues.
The expression level of ANXA2 was correlated with poor
survival, which may reflect that ANXA2 regulates cell
proliferation at the cellular level and therapeutic response
(Figure 2 and 5). The association with metastasis can be
explained by the knockdown of ANXA2 suppressing cell
migration, invasion, vascular formation, and adhesion
abilities (Figure 3). These findings are in accord with the
results of the previous studies that up-regulated ANXA2
correlated with the clinical aggressiveness in renal cancer,
endometrial cancer and colorectal carcinoma [20–22].
Meanwhile, a meta-analysis was collected from fifteen
studies including 2,321 patients, 14 cancer types (not
including NPC) demonstrated that the overexpression of
ANXA2 was correlated with poor prognosis in term of
overall survival, disease-free survival and significantly
associated with tumor invasion and lymph mode
metastasis [23]. This result might reveal that ANXA2
might be a biomarker for malignant tumors.
Epithelial– mesenchymal transition (EMT) is
important in embryonic development and cancer metastasis.
The cellular event during EMT is epithelial cells lose their
cell-cell adhesion and cell polarity, and gain migratory and
invasive properties to become mesenchymal cells [24]. It has
been characterized by down-regulation of epithelial markers

Knockdown of ANXA2 increases radio- and
chemosensitivity
Radiotherapy is the main therapeutic method for
NPC. However, the efficiency of radiotherapy in latestage patients is not good. Chemotherapy is often used
together with radiation therapy for more-advanced stages
of NPC; therefore, whether ANXA2 increased the radioand chemosensitivity of NPC cells was examined. For
the radiosensitivity assay, cells were treated with various
radiation doses (0~8 Gy) and cultured for 7 days to allow
colony formation. Silencing of ANXA2 resulted in fewer
surviving colonies compared to scrambled control cells,
and survival rates were 0.82, .079 and 0.75 at 4, 6, and 8
Gy, respectively (Figure 5A). The chemotherapeutic drugs
of cisplatin, 5-FU, docetaxel, and vincristine were used to
test for drug sensitivity. Silencing of ANXA2 increased
drug sensitivity by 30% and 21%, respectively, after
treatment with cisplatin or 5-FU for 24 h (Figure 5B, 5C).
When cells were treated with vincristine or docetaxel,
cells exhibited 32% and 20% enhanced drug sensitivity
after 24 h with a low concentration of drugs (Figure
5D, 5E). Thus, we determined that ANXA2 regulates the
therapeutic tolerance of both radio- and chemotherapies
in NPC. According to data from irradiation and
chemotherapeutic drugs, we tried to determine whether
the order of therapy (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) had

such as E-cadherin and up-regulation of mesenchymal
markers like N-cadherin, fibronectin, and vimentin [24].
Transcriptional factors such as Twist1, Snail1 Snail 2, ZEB1
and ZEB2 are also governing EMT [25]. This dynamic
process could be stimulated by the signals and forms the
microenvironment like TGF-β, Wnt, and TNFα [24–26].
In the present study, silencing of ANXA2 suppressed cell
mobility (Figure 3) might occur through an EMT process
by altering expression of the E-cadherin, N-cadherin, snail
and twist after TGF-β stimulated. The membrane form of
ANXA2 is a heterotetramer (two molecules each of ANXA2
and two S100A10). S100A10, also called p11, can combine
with plasminogen. Plasminogen is cleaved into plasmin,
which can activate pro-MMPs into active MMPs. MMP-2
and -9 are associated with the invasive ability by degrading
the cell matrix [13]. ANXA2 may participate in extracellular
matrix digestion to enable invasive behavior. In our study, we
found that knockdown of ANXA2 expression reduced a cell’s
invasive ability (Figure 3C). Therefore, the reduction in the
invasive ability through suppression of MMP activity should
be further investigated. To identify the tumor malignancy,
the angiogenesis is also one of the consideration factors.
Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is important way for tumor
development and angiogenesis [27], and silencing of ANXA2
suppressed the vascular formation ability which indicates that
ANXA2 may suppress angiogenesis (Figure 3B). ANXA2
regulates metastasis may proceed through EMT transition,
extracellular matrix digestion and angiogenesis pathway.
We confirmed that ANXA2 was correlated with
therapeutic resistance (Figure 5), and consistent result
was also reported in lung cancer [28]. The potential
effect of ANXA2 in therapeutic resistance may due to
the enlargeosomes and nuclear ANXA2. ANXA2 coats
the surface of enlargeosomes, which regulate exocytosis.
Enlargeosomes are widely expressed, non-secretory vesicles,
which are involved in Ca2+-dependent cell surface trafficking
of membranes [29–31]. We thought that knockdown of the
ANXA2 protein would influence the number and function of
enlargeosomes. If enlargeosomes cannot undergo exocytosis,
chemotherapeutic drugs might remain in cells and kill tumor
cells more quickly. ANXA2 can mitigate DNA damage
from irradiation by entering nuclei to protect the DNA.
However, the mechanism of how ANXA2 protects DNA is
unclear at present [32]. Furthermore, the role of the annexin
family of ANXA1 has been studied during radiotherapy
and chemotherapy. The expression level of ANXA1 was
associated with drug-resistance in NPC [33]. And, ANXA1
participate in tumor irradiation resistance in NPC via
regulating cell apoptosis [34].
Cellular signaling of ANXA2 was reported by
Wei Luo et al. [35]. They found that LMP1 increases the
serine phosphorylation level of ANXA2 by activating the
phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC)protein kinase C (PKC) α/PKC β pathway, which plays
an important role in serine phosphorylation and nuclear
entry of ANXA2. Serine 25 phosphorylation of ANXA2
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

was associated with its nuclear entry, DNA synthesis, and
cell proliferation. In addition, we found that knockdown
of ANXA2 decreased the expression of total Akt and
phosphorylation at Ser473 (Supplementary Figure 1). The
oncogenic serine/threonine kinase, Akt, a downstream signal
protein of phosphatidylinositol 3′ kinase (PI3K), was shown
to regulate many kinds of genes and proteins. Through the
Akt pathway, Akt is involved in cell proliferation, survival,
growth, and other undetected functions [36]. Additional
reports claimed that (1) radiation enhances cell invasion
with MMP-9 in hepatocellular carcinoma through the
PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signal transduction pathway [37]. (2)
The chaperon protein Hsp27 interacts with Akt against
UV-induced DNA damage and prevents cell apoptosis by
inhibiting p21 activation. [38]. (3) Akt regulates exocytosis
by controlling the exocytosis vesicle membrane protein
of Rab activation through downstream subtracts AS160/
TBC1D1 [39, 40]. (4) Akt suppresses transcription of the
E-cadherin and activates of SNAIL gene expression causes
the conversion of epithelial cells into invasive mesenchymal
cells [41]. Thus, ANXA2 facilitates multiple malignant
phenotypes by downregulating the expression level of Akt.
Recently, accumulated evidence suggests that a
small sub-population of cells within a tumor called cancer
stem cells (CSCs) has stem-like properties and the ability
to initiate new tumors [42]. CSCs exhibit important
properties such as self-renew, differentiation capacity,
resistance to chemo/radio-therapy and cancer invasion
and metastasis [43, 44]. Akt signaling has been reported
participating in CSC maintenance in various cancer
types [45–47] and that constitutive activation of Akt
promotes CSC resistance to chemotherapy and radiation
therapy [48]. Meanwhile, expression of stemness-related
transcription factors such as Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog
could be regulated by Akt [49–51]. Here, we found that
silencing of ANXA2 reduced cancer stem cell formation
ability (Supplementary Figure 2A) and expression of CSC
associated markers Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog (Supplementary
Figure 2B). Taken together, silencing of ANXA2 inactivate
Akt pathway and repress NPC cancer stem cells through
inhibiting expression of Sox2, Nanog and Oct4.
In 2013, Lokman et al. reported that anti-ANXA2
antibodies significantly blocked ovarian cancer cell
invasion in a CAM model and cancer cell peritoneal
dissemination in an intraperitoneal xenograft mouse model
which were consistent with our findings (Figure 3C) [14].
Based on the following considerations, ANAX2 could
serve as a therapeutic target in NPC. First, knockdown
ANAX2 directly suppressed oncogenic properties in NPC
cells. Second, ANXA2 reduced sensitivities to irradiation
and chemotherapeutic drugs (cisplatin, 5-FU, vincristine,
and docetaxel). Third, immunosuppression responses
in DCs were medicated through DC-SIGN-recognizing
ANXA2 of NPC [52].
In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that
ANXA2 promotes therapeutic tolerance and multiple

Patients with primary NPC received radiotherapy and
those with metastatic NPC received radiotherapy and/or
chemotherapy for treatment. The median follow-up time

Western blotting

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Confluent cells were collected and lysed in RIPA
buffer (Genestar Biotechnology, Taiwan). In total, 30 μg
of proteins was separated by 10% sodium dodecylsulfate
- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and
transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membranes (Life Science, Carlsbad, CA, USA). After
blocking, the membranes were hybridized with specific
primary antibodies followed by incubation with secondary
antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP).
The protein images were detected using the Western
Blotting Plus Chemiluminescence Reagent (Thermo
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The density of each
protein band was determined after normalization to an
actin control band using the Gel Image System and Image
J software (Scion Corporation, Torrance, MD, USA). The
primary antibodies used included anti-ANXA2 (R&D
System, Minneapolis, MN USA), anti-Akt, anti- Akt
S473p, anti-Akt T308p, anti-Snail, anti-TWIST, anti-Ecadherin, and anti-N-cadherin (all from Genetex, Irvine,
CA, USA). Protein images were detected using Western
Blotting Plus Chemiluminescence Reagent (Thermo
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The density of each
protein band was determined after normalization to an
actin control band using the Gel Image System and Image
J software.

by YS Chang, Chang Gung University, Taiwan), were
used [53]. All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin,
and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. All cells were grown at
37°C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.
The knockdown of ANXA2 in NPC was performed
by lentiviral short hairpin (sh)RNA interference. We
selected two shRNA (both obtained from the TRC
shRNA library) target sequences, (TRCN0000289717,
5′-GCAGGAAATTAACAGAGTCTA-3′ and TRCN0000
289781, 5′-CGGGATGCTTTGAA CATTGAA -3′)
specific for the human ANXA2 gene for efficient
depletion and a scrambled shRNA control (pLAS.
Void) with mismatched sequences. The three shRNAs
were cloned from the pLKO.1 vector into AgeI-EcoRI
sites of the pLKO.1-hPGK-Puro vector. Then, shRNAs
were transfected in packaging HEK 293T cells with
helper vectors, using the Fugene 6 transfection reagent
(Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Medium containing
lentiviral particles was harvested, filtered, separated into
aliquots, and stored at −80°C. These viruses were used
to transduce 5 × 105 cell/well in the presence of 8 μg/
ml polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in
6-well plates at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3.
Transduced cells were selected in DMEM containing
5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
Lastly, we established three stable ANXA2-knockdown
cell lines: scrambled, 717, and 781.

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using
oligo (dT) primers and the SuperScript® III First-Strand
Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Quantitative (q)PCRs were performed with FAST STBR®
Green Master Mix according to the manufacturer’s
protocol and performed on an ABi Step One Real-Time
PCR System (ABI, Foster City, CA, USA). Sequences of
oligonucleotides used for the real-time PCR analysis were
ANXA2 (forward primer 5′-CTC TAC ACC CCC AAG
TGC A-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TCA GTG CTG ATG
CAA GTT CC-3′) and GAPDH (forward primer 5′-CGG
AGT CAA CGG ATT TGG TCG TAT G-3′ and reverse
primer 5′-AGC CTT CTC CAT GGT GGT GAA GA-3′).
GAPDH expression was used as a control to normalize
data of other RNA levels.

Patient tissue samples
This study was approved by the Institutional
Review Broad of Human Investigation Committee in
Taipei Medical University (TMU-JIRB No. 201312014).
A total of 61 formalin-fixed paraffin nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (NPC) tissue samples from primary (n = 48)
and metastatic (n = 13) were obtained from TMU Hospital
(Taipei, Taiwan). The original diagnosis for each subject
was in accordance with the World Health Organization
Classification. The patients included 40 males and
21 females with an age range of 25 to 85 years (mean
age: 47.44). Biopsies of tumor samples were obtained

Cell proliferation, chemosensitivity, and
radiosensitivity assays
In total, 2000 cells with stable ANXA2-silenced
or scrambled control cells were seeded in 96-well plates.
26955

Oncotarget

Cell proliferation was detected at 24 and 48 h by an MTT
assay. To determine the chemosensitivity, 2000 cells were
seeded for 16 h and treated with various doses of cisplatin,
5-FU, vincristine, and docetaxel. Numbers of surviving
cells were counted and compared to numbers of surviving
untreated cells. To determine the radiosensitivity, 104
cells were plated in 6-cm dishes, and after incubation for
24 h, cells were exposed to a range of radiation doses (0~8
Gray). After irradiation, cells were further cultured for
7 days. Numbers of surviving colonies (defined as a
colony with ≥ 50 cells) were counted. The survival fraction
was calculated as the number of colonies divided by the
number of cells of the control times 100. The colony
number was counted with Image J software.

incubated with E-cadherin and N-cadherin antibodies, and
stained with an FITC or PE secondary antibody. Samples
were mounted with mounting media containing DAPI. The
fluorescence was visualized using a confocal laser microscope.

Xenograft tumor mice model
NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/JNarl mice were purchased
from National Applied Research Laboratories (NARLabs,
Taipei, Taiwan). All studies were conducted in accordance
with IACUC-approved protocols. In total, 12 mice at
6 weeks of age were used. In total, 2 × 106 TW01
scrambled cells or 781 cells were subcutaneously injected
into each mouse. The tumor volume was calculated using
the formula (S2 × L)/2, where S is the short length of the
tumor and L is the long length of the tumor.

Migration, invasion, and adhesion assays
The cell migration assay was performed using an
in vitro wound healing assay. Cells were seeded in ibidi
Culture-Inserts (ibidi, Verona, WI, USA) and incubated
until fully confluent; then, culture inserts were detached
to form a cell-free gap in a monolayer of cells. The cell
migration status toward the gap area was photographed
every 7 h. The cell invasion assay was performed using
the BD BioCoat Matrigel invasion chambers (Becton
Dickinson Biosciences, Bedford, MA, USA) and Millicell
invasion chambers (Merck Millipore, Germany). The
Millicell upper chamber inserts, the membranes of which
have a pore size of 8 mm, were placed in a 24-well plate
and coated with Matrigel. Cells were seeded in the upper
chambers with media containing 1% FBS. The lower
chambers contained complete culture media (10% FBS)
to trap the invading cells. The invasive ability of cells was
determined at 6 and 12 h. Cells invading the lower side
of membrane were fixed, stained with crystal violet, and
photographed. For the adhesion assay, plates were coated
with collagen I, removed after 12 h, and then air-dried.
Cells were seeded onto the plates and incubated for 2 and
4 h. After incubation, unattached cells were washed off
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then cells were
fixed and stained with crystal violet and photographed.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)

Tube formation assay

All results are expressed as the mean ± standard error
of the mean (SEM). Data were compared using a t-test. All
graphs were drawn using GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad
Software, Inc. La Jolla, CA, USA). A Chi-squared test
was used to examine the association of ANXA2 protein
expressions and clinicopathologic features. Survival curves
were calculated by a log-rank test. All p values were
2-sided, and the significance level was set at p < 0.05.

Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded xenograft
tumors or NPC tissues were deparaffinized in xylene, boiled
in citrate buffer to retrieve the antigens, and blocked with
hydrogen peroxide. Slides were incubated with an antiannexin A2 antibody (R&D system, Minneapolis, MN
USA) followed by secondary antibody-conjugated HRP. The
reaction was developed using the substrate DAB chromogen
system. Counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin
before dehydration and mounting. Staining reactions were
determined by microscopic examination. Each sample was
given a score according to the H-score. H-score = I × P.
“ I “ means staining intensity. Score 0, no staining; score 1+,
weak staining; score 2+, moderate staining; score 3+, strong
staining. “ P “ means percent of cell at each staining intensity
level. An individual ANXA2 IHC score (H-score) value
from 0 to 300 was generated from the tumor sample of each
patient. 50 points of H-score was set as the cut off value for
determination of positive/ negative. Positive immunostaining
of ANXA2 in lesion tissues and its associations with
clinicopathological parameters were analyzed.

Statistical analysis

Angiogenesis was evaluated by tube formation.
Cells of the scrambled control and two strains of
shANXA2 (2 × 104 cells/well) were grown in a 96-well
plate pre-coated with Matrigel, and incubated for 16 h
at 37°C. The formation of capillary-like structures was
captured. The degree of angiogenesis was quantified as
the number of branching points per view.

Immunofluorescence staining
