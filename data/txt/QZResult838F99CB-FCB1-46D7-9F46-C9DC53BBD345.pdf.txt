BACKGROUND: The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4a is strongly and consistently overexpressed in all human papillomavirus
(HPV)-associated cancers. Therefore, the authors hypothesized that p16INK4a may be a vaccine target antigen for HPV-associated cancers. To test this hypothesis, the authors performed a phase 1/2a first-in-human trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a
p16INK4a-based peptide vaccine. METHODS: A total of 26 patients with different, advanced, p16INK4a-overexpressing, HPV DNApositive cancers were included after the completion of standard treatment. According to protocol, 12 subcutaneous injections of a
p16INK4 peptide (P16_37-63) mixed in a water-in-oil emulsion with immunoadjuvant activity (Montanide ISA-51 VG) were administered
over a 6-month period. RESULTS: A total of 20 patients received at least 4 injections and were evaluable for immune responses
against P16_37-63. Clusters of differentiation (CD) 4 T cells were detected in 14 of 20 patients (3 of whom had preexisting CD4 T cells
before vaccination), CD8 T cells were detected in 5 of 20 patients, and antibodies were detected in 14 of 20 patients (1 of whom had
preexisting antibodies). No suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction or serious adverse drug reaction was documented. All
reported serious adverse events were expected and not considered to be related to study therapy. None of the patients discontinued
trial participation due to unacceptable toxicities and no dose-limiting toxicities occurred. Tumor response could be assessed in 14
patients. Of these, 9 patients (64%) had stable disease as their best overall response and 5 patients (36%) developed progressive disease. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination with the p16INK4a-derived peptide P16_37-63 appears to induce cellular and humoral immune
responses and does not cause severe toxicities. The results of the current study pave the way for the further clinical development of

INTRODUCTION
Approximately 5% of all cancers are attributable to human papillomavirus (HPV) infections.1In addition to virtually all
cervical cancers,2 30% to 90% of other anogenital cancers located at the vulva, vagina, anus, and penis and approximately
30% of cancers of the head and neck region also are causally linked to HPV.3
The transforming properties of HPV are due to its oncogenes: E6 and E7.4Although permissive infections without
significant transcription of E6 and E7 are clinically harmless, when the virus persists the oncogenes may become hyperactivated and uncoupled from their regular tight control.5 This uncontrolled activation of the 2 viral oncogenes and the associated overexpression are required to induce and maintain the neoplastic growth of HPV-associated cancers.
The viral E6 and E7 oncoproteins have been targets in various immunotherapy studies for HPV-induced cancers.6
However, their clinical efficacy in trials appears limited and responses in patients with cancer using various vaccine
approaches have been rare exceptions.6,7 Regression after the vaccination of patients with HPV-induced premalignancies
was demonstrated only in single studies in approximately one-half of the patients.8-10 The limited success may be due in
part to immunoevasion and immunoediting against the viral antigens in patients with persistent HPV infections and

(pre)cancer that may compromise a successful induction
of immunity by vaccination.11 Therefore, we hypothesized that cellular antigens expressed in HPV-transformed
cells potentially represent better targets and may be worthwhile to explore. In particular, antigens with very high
expression levels in the respective target cells have been
suggested as ideal candidates.12
One such novel candidate antigen is the cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4a. In the late 1990s,
we and others found that E6/E7 oncogene activation in
HPV-infected cells leads to strong overexpression of
p16INK4a.13 Meanwhile, the underlying mechanism has
been elucidated and E7-induced activation of a histone
demethylase (KDM6B) and resulting epigenetic reprogramming of the p16INK4a-encoding CDKN2A gene is
considered responsible for its overexpression.14 Monoclonal antibody-based p16INK4a detection by immunochemistry led to diagnostic tools with which to specifically
highlight HPV-transformed cells. To date, numerous
clinical studies have demonstrated the superiority of
p16INK4a detection compared with conventional diagnostic tools that are used to detect HPV-induced (pre)cancers
of various anatomic locations.15,16 p16INK4a is not detectable on the protein level in the majority of normal cells.
Apart from HPV-mediated activation, its expression is
activated at the time of genomic damage or oxidative or
oncogene-induced stress.17 Increasing levels of p16INK4a
can induce immediate cell cycle arrest and irreversible cellular senescence. Consequently, no or only very low levels
of p16INK4a are expressed in young organisms, but this
only becomes detectable in an increasing number of singular cells in most organs as individuals age.17-19
The pattern of predominant expression in neoplastic
cells suggests that, in addition to its role as a clinically important biomarker for HPV-associated cancers, p16INK4a
also may represent an interesting tumor antigen. Its high
expression in proliferating neoplastic cells already in early
phases of neoplastic transformation during precancer
stages and its near absence in normal tissues that retain
proliferation capacity is a unique characteristic of
p16INK4a.20 Furthermore, recent data have suggested that
continuous expression of p16INK4a is required to maintain
in vitro growth of HPV-associated cervical cancer cell
lines, pointing to a direct prooncogenic activity of
p16INK4a.21,22 The potential role of p16INK4a as a tumor
antigen was underscored by the detection of humoral and
cellular immune responses against p16INK4a in single individuals, thus indicating no complete tolerance against the
autoantigen.23
1426

As a first step toward p16INK4a-based therapeutic
vaccination for patients with HPV-induced neoplasia, we
tested the safety and immunogenicity of the approach in a
phase 1/2a study. For these purposes, we selected a 27amino acid-long p16INK4a peptide (P16_37-63), which
represents a p16INK4a fragment with in silico-predicted Tcell epitopes. Spontaneous interferon(IFN) l-secreting T
cells upon stimulation with this peptide in vitro have been
observed previously in single tested individuals; however,
an association between T cells with p16INK4a overexpression and clinical outcomes has not been determined from
the small number of tested subjects (unpublished data).
The peptide was administered combined with the mineral
oil-based adjuvant Montanide ISA-51 VG (SEPPIC
GmbH, Cologne, Germany). In the current study, we
demonstrated that no severe side effects were noted to be
related to the vaccination and that vaccinated patients
developed a consistent and robust humoral and cellular
immune response against P16_37-63.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Investigational Agent

The P16_37-63 peptide was synthesized, formulated,
packed, and distributed in accordance with current GMP
protocols by Bachem (Weil am Rhein, Germany). Montanide ISA-51 VG was supplied by SEPPIC GmbH.
Before vaccination, the lyophilized peptide (150 lg) was
removed from the freezer and dissolved in 45 lL of 100%
dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted further in 405 lL of
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). A total of 300 lL of the
peptide solution (100 lg) was mixed with 300 lL of
Montanide ISA-51 VG in a syringe until both liquids
were intermixed and a thick, creamy, opaque, and consistent emulsion was generated. A total of 600 lL of the
emulsion (100 lg of peptide) was administered subcutaneously. For the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH),
90 lL of dimethyl sulfoxide/PBS-dissolved peptide
(30 lg of peptide) was mixed with an additional 210 lL
of PBS and injected intradermally at a separate site
from the vaccination to give a visible and palpable
skin depot.
Study Endpoints and Inclusion Criteria

This study was an open-label, single-arm phase 1/2a study
of immunization with a p16INK4a peptide combined with
MONTANIDE ISA-51 VG in patients with advanced
HPV-associated cancers. Primary endpoints were safety
(phase 1) and immunogenicity (phase 2a). Secondary
endpoints were tumor response (both phases) and immunogenicity (phase 1) and safety (phase 2a). The study

started as a phase 1 study with 10 patients. Interim safety
results of phase 1 were submitted to the authorities, and
after approval the study continued as phase 2a (16
patients). For both phases, patients were eligible for inclusion if they had HPV DNA-positive, p16INK4a-overexpressing, metastatic, measurable stage IV cancer or
resected high-risk stage IV cancer of the uterine cervix,
head and neck region, anus, vulva, vagina, or penis. HPVDNA status was determined from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue by polymerase chain reaction
and hybridization (kit for multiplex HPV genotyping
purchased from DiaMex GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany).24 p16INK4a status was determined by immunohistochemistry (CINtec Histology; Roche, Mannheim,
Germany) and considered positive in the case of continuous diffuse positive staining.20 Patients had to have completed, failed, or declined standard therapy; have had an
expected survival of at least 6 months; and have had an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
of 0, 1, or 2. Patients were excluded if they had received
chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy within 4
weeks before study entry; had untreated brain metastases;
had immunodeficiency syndromes or autoimmune disease; or did not provide written informed consent. The
study was approved by the regulatory authorities (PaulEhrlich Institute and ethics committee of the LandesuÌ‚rzteekammer Hessen) and registered (short name VicOryx
[ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01462838; EudraCT
no. 2011-000948-18]). All study patients provided written informed consent. The study was sponsored by Oryx
GmbH und Co KG (Baldham, Germany).
Vaccine Scheme

Patients received 100 lg of P16_37-63 peptide combined
with Montanide ISA-51 VG subcutaneously once a week
for 4 weeks, followed by a 4-weeks rest period (1 cycle).
This schedule was repeated for a total of 3 cycles (12 vaccinations) (Fig. 1). Study treatment was discontinued in the
case of disease progression or intolerable toxicity.
Toxicity Assessment

Patients were considered evaluable for toxicity if they
received at least 1 dose of P16_37-63. Patients were seen
at baseline/screening and at every vaccination visit for
safety assessment until disease progression or discontinuation of trial therapy for other reasons. Patients were
assessed for adverse events by nondirective questioning.
Adverse events also were recorded when they were
reported by the patient during or between visits or
through physical examination, laboratory test, or other

assessments. Laboratory tests included autoantibody status (antinuclear antibodies [ANA], antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, antimitochondrial antibodies,
microsomal antibodies, and thyroid-stimulating hormone
[TSH] receptor antibodies) in addition to regular complete blood cell counts and chemistry. All adverse events
were documented according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events
(CTCAE; version 4.0). The relationship between an
adverse event and the investigational agent was determined by the investigator.
Immunogenicity Assessment

Patients were considered evaluable for the immunologic
efficacy of the study treatment if they completed at least 1
cycle (4 doses of P16_37-63) with subsequent immune
assessment (week 9). The efficacy of the study treatment
was defined as the induction of an immune response
against P16_37-63 during or after vaccination. Immunological responses were evaluated in weeks 9, 17, and 25 (T
cells by DTH and enzyme-linked ImmunoSpot [ELISpot]) and in weeks 3, 9, 11, 17, 19, and 25 (antibodies
by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay [ELISA]) and
were compared with the antigen-specific immune
response measured before vaccination (week 1). Immune
response was reassessed 2 months after the end of the
study. For the assessment of DTH, 30 lg of P16_37-63
peptide without adjuvant was administered intradermally
and reactions were documented after 48 hours. DTH was
considered positive if an area of redness and induration
measuring>4 mm in diameter (1) or an enlarged area of
redness and palpable induration of >8 mm in diameter
and/or central necrosis (11) was observed. CD4 and
CD8 T cells from the peripheral blood that were reactive
against the P16_37-63 peptide were determined by IFN-c
ELISpot using autologous peptide-pulsed dendritic cells
as antigen-presenting cells as reported previously.25 Antibodies reactive against the P16_37-63 peptide were determined by peptide ELISA as published previously.23 A
positive immune response was defined as a positive DTH
response against peptide P16_37-63 and/or a humoral
(ELISA) and/or CD8 and/or CD4 cellular (ELISpot)
immune response exceeding the assay-specific cutoff values for a positive response against peptide P16_37-63. In
ELISpot, a response was considered positive if the number
of spots in the peptide-exposed wells was at least 2 times
higher than the number of spots in the unstimulated wells
and if the number was >10 peptide-specific spots per
25,000 T cells (after subtraction of background spots).
Positive ELISpot responses were further separated into

achieving clinical disease remission. All 26 patients
received at least 1 application of P16_37-63, a total of 25
patients completed the first cycle (4 applications), and 8
patients completed the entire vaccination scheme of 3
cycles (12 applications) (Table 1). Premature study discontinuation was due to progressive disease (9 patients) or
death (5 patients) in the majority of patients (Table 1).

low (<300 spots [1]), intermediate (300-700 spots
[11]), and high (>700 spots [111]). In ELISA, a
response was considered positive if the optical density
against the P16_37-63 peptide after subtraction of the
background signal without peptide exceeded an optical
density at 450 nanometers (nm) (OD450) of 0.1. Positive
ELISA responses were further separated into low (<OD
0.5 [1]), intermediate (OD of 0.5-1.5 [11]), and high
(>OD 1.5 [111]).

Toxicity

TUMOR STATUS ASSESSMENT AND
CLINICAL RESPONSE
Patients were considered evaluable for tumor response if
they had measurable tumors with radiological tumor
imaging (computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging) at baseline. Tumor size was then measured every 8 weeks until the end of the study or study
discontinuation. Poststudy follow-up was performed after
6 months. Tumor status was classified according to
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria.
According to the protocol, signs of progressive disease and
death events were assessed and recorded during the trial
and at follow-up. Progression-free survival (PFS) was
defined as the time between the day of the first study treatment and the detection of progressive disease or death
from any cause, whichever occurred first. Overall survival
(OS) was defined as the time between the day of the first
study treatment and death from any cause.

All 26 patients were considered evaluable for toxicity
because they received at least 1 dose of P16_37-63. No serious adverse drug reactions or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions were documented and no new or
unexpected risks appeared in the study. No deaths with a
possible relation to the study therapy were noted to occur.
The deaths reported were related to progression of the
underlying tumor. All reported serious adverse events
were found to be unrelated to the study treatment. Significant adverse events that were found to be related to the
study treatment were mild injection site reactions in 10
patients with only CTCAE grade 1. Symptoms with a
possible relation to the study therapy were anorexia, fatigue, hyperglycemia, hyperhidrosis, peripheral sensory
neuropathy, and transient mild elevation of TSH receptor
antibodies and ANA in 1 patient each, all of which were
CTCAE grade 1. No patient discontinued trial participation due to unacceptable toxicities and no dose-limiting
toxicities occurred.

Patients

A total of 20 patients were considered evaluable for
immunologic efficacy because they completed at least 1
cycle and had at least 1 subsequent immune assessment
(week 9 or later). Induction of immune responses against
P16_37-63 was monitored by DTH, IFN-cELISpot
(CD4 and CD8 T cells), and ELISA (antibodies). In total,
85.0% of evaluable patients (17 of 20 patients) demonstrated an immune response against the P16_37-63
peptide (Fig. 2). Preexisting immune responses against
P16_37-63 before vaccination (week 1) were rare in these
patients (1 patient had a positive DTH in week 1, 3

A total of 26 patients with advanced p16INK4a-overexpressing, HPV DNA-positive cancer were included in the
study as per protocol. The majority of patients (17
patients) had a diagnosis of cervical cancer, 7 patients
were diagnosed with head and neck cancer, and 1 patient
each was diagnosed with anal and vulvar cancer, respectively (Table 1). All patients had advanced disease at the
time of study entry and nearly all patients (24 patients)
had previously received standard tumor treatments (ie,

response became stronger after vaccination) (Fig. 2).
Thus, 81.3% of patients (13 of 16 patients) developed a
de novo immune response during the study when the
patients with preexisting immune responses were
excluded (Fig. 2). All 8 patients who completed the entire
vaccination scheme with 12 applications developed an
immune response. In the majority of patients, positive
immune reactions developed by week 9 and remained
until the end of treatment (Fig. 2). The most frequent
type of detectable immune response was of an antibody
and CD4 nature, each with 14 positive patients (including
1 patient with preexisting antibodies and 3 patients with
preexisting CD4 T cells). The magnitudes of detectable
antibodies and CD4 T cells were found to increase during
the study among 8 patients (indicated by 1 , 1 1, and

tion Table 1). CD8 T cells were detected in 5 patients. A
positive DTH reaction was observed in 4 patients (1
was found to be positive already at baseline in week 1)
(Fig. 2).
Tumor Response

Tumor response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumorscriteria could be assessed in 14
patients. Of these, 9 patients (64%) had stable disease as
their best overall response, and 5 patients (36%) developed progressive disease at the time of first staging (Table
1). No patient demonstrated a partial or complete
response after vaccination with the P16_37-63 peptide.
The median follow-up was 5.6 months with a maximum
follow-up of approximately 1.5 years. The median PFS
for all 26 patients was 3.5 months and was 2.7 months for
those patients with evaluable signs of malignancy present
at the time of study recruitment. The median OS for all
26 patients was 11.9 months, and was 9.2 months for

those patients with prevalent tumor disease. Patients with
longer PFS and OS more often developed positive
immune responses against P16_37-63; however, this was
considered to be due to more vaccine administrations and
less frequent premature study discontinuation in these
patients.
DISCUSSION
The results of the current phase 1/2a study demonstrated
that vaccination with a p16INK4a peptide is safe and induces cellular and humoral immune responses against the
vaccine antigen P16_37-63 in patients with advanced
p16INK4a-overexpressing tumors.
The strong and constant overexpression of p16INK4a
in HPV-induced precancers and cancers makes the antigen an interesting target for therapeutic vaccination. To
date, therapeutic vaccination approaches for HPVassociated disease have been restricted to viral antigens,
with clinical responses noted in approximately 50% of
women with premalignant lesions.8,9 Therefore, the evaluation of alternative cellular targets is an important complementary step.
The results of the current study, which is the first-inhuman study of the safety profile of vaccination with
P16_37-63 combined with Montanide ISA-51 VG, can
be considered favorable. None of the 26 patients included
discontinued trial participation due to toxicities. In particular, all reported deaths and serious adverse events were
found to be unrelated to the study treatment. Adverse
events that were related to the study treatment were mild
injection site reactions in 10 patients, a finding that is considered comparable to previous reports of Montanidecontaining peptide vaccinations. Mild symptoms of
CTCAE grade 1 with possible relation to the study therapy noted in 6 patients (anorexia, fatigue, hyperglycemia,
hyperhidrosis, peripheral sensory neuropathy, and transient mild elevation of TSH receptor antibodies and
ANA) were considered to be associated for the most part
with underlying known diseases rather than with the vaccination due to the low number of these events and their
singular occurrence. However, future studies will have to
further monitor possible side effects of p16INK4a vaccination thoroughly. Although expression levels of p16INK4a
in normal tissues are very low and therefore major tissuedestructive autoimmune reactions are unlikely, endocrine
organs in particular may express p16INK4a in single cells.19,26In addition, increased numbers of p16INK4a-positive
cells in various organs have been observed in aging individuals.19,26 More recent reports have suggested that
p16INK4a may further directly contribute to ageingCancer

related pathologies.18 Consequently, one may speculate
that the elimination of p16INK4a-expressing normal cells
would not lead to adverse side effects but, in contrast, may
be even more beneficial for affected organisms.
In addition, the trial endpoint of immunogenicity
was met. The applied long p16INK4a peptide P16_37-63
combined with Montanide ISA 51 VG was found to
induce antibody and/or T cell responses in 85% of
patients who received at least 1 cycle and in all patients
who received all 3 cycles. These numbers can be considered to be very promising and entirely comparable to
what has been observed before with viral peptide antigens
HPV E6 and E7.27Given the detection of antibodies and
CD4, as well as CD8 T cells against P16_37-63, it is likely
that vaccine-induced immune responses comprise the
whole spectrum of immunologic pathways. The immunogenicity of p16INK4a might even be improved in patients
with less advanced disease stages than in the current study.
Although to our knowledge no distinct immune profile
has been consistently linked to clinical response in cancer
vaccine trials,28 it may be speculated that a broad response
including CD4 and CD8 T cells may be important for
disease control and hence clinical efficacy.
The evaluation of clinical responses in the current
phase 1/2a study was included as a secondary endpoint
with limited expectations due to the advanced stage of disease noted among the recruited patients. The median PFS
and OS for all 26 patients were short (3.5 months and
11.9 months, respectively) and no patient with disseminated cervical cancer survived beyond 18 months. The
best overall tumor response was documented as stable disease in 9 of 14 evaluable patients during the study treatment. Patients with longer PFS and OS more often
developed positive immune responses against P16_37-63;
however, this was considered to be due to more vaccine
administrations and less often premature study discontinuation in these patients. There was no obviously different
clinical course in the 4 patients with preexisting antip16INK4a immune responses before vaccination compared
with the remaining patients (Fig. 2). At the current time,
it is too early to draw conclusions regarding tumor
response after vaccination with the P16_37-63peptide.
For further studies, it will be important to include patients
with a defined disease stage and tumor type to evaluate the
clinical efficacy of this approach. In addition, alternative
adjuvants, such as CpG and other toll-like receptor-stimulating compounds, have been reported to induce favorable vaccine-induced immune profiles.29 Most important,
combining the vaccine with immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting, for example, the programmed cell death 1

(PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) pathway to overcome immune evasion phenomena30 will be a
highly promising approach for the future. p16INK4a overexpression is not only characteristic of HPV-associated
cancers but also has been shown in breast, prostate, colon,
lung, bladder, and many other cancer types.17 In addition,
p16INK4a has been reported to be overexpressed in the majority of premalignant lesions.17 Therefore, specific
immune targeting of p16INK4a-positive cells holds great
potential not only for HPV-associated tumors but also for
many other cancer types. With the results of the current
study, we have demonstrated that a peptide vaccine based
on p16INK4a is a promising approach that should be pursued further to achieve these goals.
