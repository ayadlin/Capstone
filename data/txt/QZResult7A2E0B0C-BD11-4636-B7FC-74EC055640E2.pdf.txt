Abstract
Tasquinimod is an orally active antiangiogenic drug that is currently in phase III clinical trials for
the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, the target of this drug has remained
unclear. In this study, we applied diverse strategies to identify the histone deacetylase HDAC4 as a target
for the antiangiogenic activity of tasquinimod. Our comprehensive analysis revealed allosteric binding
(Kd 10–30 nmol/L) to the regulatory Zn2þ binding domain of HDAC4 that locks the protein in a conformation preventing HDAC4/N-CoR/HDAC3 complex formation. This binding inhibited colocalization of
N-CoR/HDAC3, thereby inhibiting deacetylation of histones and HDAC4 client transcription factors, such as
HIF-1a, which are bound at promoter/enhancers where epigenetic reprogramming is required for cancer cell
survival and angiogenic response. Through this mechanism, tasquinimod is effective as a monotherapeutic
agent against human prostate, breast, bladder, and colon tumor xenografts, where its efﬁcacy could be
further enhanced in combination with a targeted thapsigargin prodrug (G202) that selectively kills tumor
endothelial cells. Together, our ﬁndings deﬁne a mechanism of action of tasquinimod and offer a perspective
on how its clinical activity might be leveraged in combination with other drugs that target the tumor
microenvironment. Cancer Res; 73(4); 1386–99. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Oral dosing with tasquinimod (TasQ; Fig. 1A) results in a
doubling of progression free survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC; ref. 1). Based
on these results, phase III registration trials for metastatic
CRPC are ongoing. Preclinical studies show that TasQ suppresses reciprocal cross-talk between cancer and tumor inﬁltrating host cells such as endothelial cells, myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (MDSC), and macrophages (2–7). Such suppression inhibits tumor angiogenesis needed for cancer cell
survival as documented by a variety of assays including endothelial capillary tube formation, aortic ring assay, chorioallantoic membrane assay, real-time tumor blood ﬂow and
pO2 measurements, tumor blood vessel density, and tumor
hypoxic and apoptotic fractions (2–6). This suppression is
signiﬁcant because cancers outgrow their blood supply, which

results in the tumor microenvironment becoming acidic, hypoxic, and low in nutrients (8). Continued growth in such a
stressful microenvironment requires cancer and tumor inﬁltrating host cells to initiate epigenetic reprogramming, leading to
an "angiogenic switch," which involves downregulation of
inhibitory genes such as thrombospondin-1 coupled with the
upregulation of stimulatory genes such as hypoxia-induced
factor-1a (i.e., HIF-1a; ref. 9).
TasQ's suppression of this epigenetic angiogenic switch (5)
provides a rationale for its efﬁcacy in preclinical models against
primary cancer as well as its inhibition of metastasis when used
as monotherapy (3, 10) and explains why it enhances efﬁcacy
when combined with androgen ablation (4), taxane-based chemotherapy (4), or fractionated radiation (6), therapies known
to induce a stressful tumor microenvironment. The focus of
this report is the identiﬁcation of TasQ's molecular targets to
use this information to rationally design combinational approaches to enhance therapeutic beneﬁt in the clinic.

Recombinant wild-type and C669/H675-mutated HDAC4
proteins
pcDNA vector containing human N-terminal ﬂag-tag fulllength wild-type histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) was obtained
from Addgene (Cat # 13821). To produce recombinant C669/
H675 mutated HDAC4 protein, pcDNA vector containing
human N-terminal ﬂag-tag full-length wild-type HDAC4 was
mutated using the Quick Change Site Directed Mutagenesis kit
from Agilent Technologies (Cat # 200523) according to manufacturer's protocol. HEK-292Tcells were transfected with these
vectors and 48 hours latter, cells washed with phosphatase
inhibitor from Roche (Cat# 0490684500); lysed in 50 mmol/L
Tris HCl pH 7.4 with 150 mmol/L NaCl/1% Triton and protease
inhibitor cocktail tablet from Roche (Cat# 11836170001). The
resulting lysate was incubated overnight at 4 C with a 50%
suspension of ﬂag agarose from Sigma-Aldrich (Cat # A4596);
lysate-agarose mixture centrifuged, washed twice, slurry transferred to chromatography column from BioRad (Cat# 7311550);
column washed multiple times without Triton; protein eluted
with 100 mg/mL 3X ﬂag peptide from Sigma-Aldrich (Cat#
F4799); and dialyzed in PBS and protein concentrated using
ultraﬁltration centrifugal ﬁlter concentrator [Amicon/Millipore
(Cat # UFC203024PL)].
Three-dimensional (3D)-endothelial sprouting assay was
conducted using a minimum of 5 replicate wells per drug dose
per experiment, repeated 3 independent times as described
previously (11) using human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs; Lonza Walkersville, Inc.) with modiﬁcation that
20 mL of 10X concentrated Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's
Media/10%FCS media conditioned by conﬂuent human primary lung ﬁbroblasts (Lonza) diluted to 200 mL of growth
factor supplemented EGM-2 media (Lonza) was used instead
of ﬁbroblast coculture.

culture conditions for their in vitro maintenance and the
in vivo protocol for their xenografting into immune-deﬁcient
nude mice are as described previously (3, 12, 13). All lines
were mycoplasma negative using the MycoSensor PCR Assay
kit (Agilent Technologies) and genetically authenticated
within the last 6 months using short tandem repeat proﬁling conducted by the Johns Hopkins Genetic Resource
Core Facility. In vitro growth curves were determined as
described (12, 13). Animal studies were conducted according to animal protocol MO09M434 approved by Johns
Hopkins Animal Care and Use Committee. Daily orally TasQ
dosing via the drinking water, tumor volume measurements,
tumor blood vessel density determination, and tissue oxygenation expressed as mmHg were as described previously
(3, 4). These experiments were repeated at 3 independent
times for each xenograft.
Biochemical assays
Coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) of whole cell lysates or
nuclear fractions was via a kit from Active Motif (Nuclear
Complex Co-IP kit, Cat# 54001) according to manufacturer's
protocol. For co-IP with recombinant full length ﬂag-tagged
N-CoR (i.e., amino-acid 1-2,440) from Abcam (Cat #
ab82239), 100 ng of the protein was incubated with 20 mL
antiﬂag M2 afﬁnity gel beads from Sigma-Aldrich (Cat#
A2220) for 2 hours and then the mixture centrifuged, pelleted beads washed 3 times, resuspended, and 20 ng of
recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged HDAC4
(i.e., amino acid 627-1,085) obtained from BPS Bioscience
(Cat # 50004) added to the mixture, which was incubated
overnight at 4 C. The mixture was centrifuged, pellet washed
3 times, and then immunoblotted (IB) with anti-GST antibody. For co-IP with recombinant GST-tagged HDAC4, 20 ng
of the protein in 500 mL of pH8 buffer (i.e., 50 mmol/L Tris,
150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol, 10 mmol/L Zn,
1% Triton-X100) was incubated with 20 mL Glutathione
Sepharose 4B Beads from GE Life Sciences (Cat # 170756-01) for 2 hours and then the mixture centrifuged,
pelleted beads washed 3 times, resuspended in
pH 8 buffer, and 100 ng of recombinant ﬂag-tagged-N-CoR
added. The mixture was incubated overnight at 4 C and
then the mixture centrifuged, pellet washed 3 times, and
then sample was IB with antiﬂag antibody.
For cell-based co-IP, cells transiently transfected with
pcDNA vector containing either N-terminal ﬂag-tag full-length
wild-type HDAC4 from Addgene (Cat # 13821) or HDAC3
from Addgene (Cat # 13819) were harvested after 48 hours,
antiﬂag IP conducted as described for isolation of recombinant
proteins. IP was then IB with indicated antibody conducted.
The biochemical and cell-based co-IP experiment were repeated independently at least 3 times with representative gels
presenting the results.
For detection of acetylated HIF-1a, cells were maintained under hypoxic conditions (i.e., 2% O2) for 24 hours
and then lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer
(RIPA) buffer containing added Roche protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysate was centrifuged, supernatant
mixed with 4 mg acetylated lysine antibody and 40 mL Protein

A agarose (Santa Cruz, Cat # sc-2001), incubated overnight
at 4 C, mixture centrifuged and pelleted beads washed
4 times with RIPA buffer and then IB with anti-HIF-1a
antibody conducted. These experiments were repeated 3
independent times with a representative gel presented.
Total HDAC and isotype speciﬁc HDAC enzymatic activity
was assayed on a per cell basis using the appropriate substrates
as described previously (14, 15). Recombinant human HDAC
isotypes were obtained commercial as follows: HDAC1 (Millipore, Cat#14-838); HDAC3 (BioMol/Enzo Life Sciences cat#SE507); HDAC4 (Millipore cat#14-828); HDAC6 (BioMol/Enzo
cat#SE-508); and HDAC8 (Millipore cat#14-609). These experiments were repeated a minimum of 3 independent times with 5
replicates per time point.
Surface plasmon resonance
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis was carried out
with the Biacore 3000 system (GE Healthcare) as described
previously (16). Sensor chips, amine coupling kit, immobilization and running buffers, and regeneration solutions were as
described previously (16). Binding to TasQ was determined for
human full length N-terminal GST-tagged HDAC4 (Abnova
Cat# H00009759-P01). GST-tagged HDAC4 was immobilized
onto a CM5 chip through an amine linkage. This chip was used
to determine binding of full-length human N-CoR (Abcam Cat#
ab82239). These experiments were repeated 3 independent
times.
Computer docking modeling
The active versus inactive conformations of HDAC4 were
overlaid using the Ca atoms of crystal structures previous reported (17). Protein surfaces generated and systematically examined for plausible binding pockets. The revealed binding
pockets were explored by iterative docking, during which binding poses were reﬁned by interplay of manual docking, Glide
runs, and visual inspection of the modeled ligand-protein complex. More than 20 docking poses were generated. The ﬁnal
model selected based on the conformational energy for the
ligand as well as the computed ligand-protein energy. The computational simulation was conducted using Schr€
odinger's molecular modeling environment Maestro (www.schrodinger.com).
HDAC4 knockdown and restoration
Stable shRNA HDAC4 knockdown cells were generated using pLK0.1 lentiviral vector from Open Biosystems
(Thermo Scientiﬁc) containing the following speciﬁc shRNA
sequences: shRNA1 (CCGGCGACTCATCTTGTAGCTTATTCTCGAGAATAAGCTACA AGATGAGTCGTTTTT); shRNA2
(CCGGC GTGGGTTTCAACGTCAACATCTCGAGATGTTGACGTTGAAACCCACGTTTTT); shRNA3 (CCGGGCAGCTCAAGAACAAGGAGAACTCGAGTTCTCCTTGTTCTTGA GCTGCTTTTT); and the nonspeciﬁc shRNA sequence was (CCTAAGGTTAAGTCGC CCTCGCTCGAGCGAGGGCGACTTAACCTAGGTTTTT). To generate HDAC4 restoration expression
vector resistant to shRNA2 knockdown, 2 nucleotides at positions 9 and 12 in the sHRNA2 targeting region were changed
to making it resistant to the HDAC4 shRNA without altering
the amino acid sequence of wild-type protein.

HIF-1a transcriptional assays
PC-3 human prostate cancer cells stably integrated with
EGFPgene under a promoter containing 5 copies of the HIF1a-driven hypoxia response element (HRE) of the VEGF gene
as described previously (18) were exposed to different doses of
TasQ under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions for 24
hours and cell lysates analyzed by IB for GFP from 3 independent experiments. HUVECs exposed to different doses of TasQ
under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions were cotransfected with 1 mg of the p2.1 expression plasmid containing
ﬁreﬂy luciferase under a HIF-1a-driven HRE of the enolase
gene and 0.1 mg of p-thymidine kinase (pTK)-Renilla control
plasmid containing Renilla luciferase under a TK-driven promote using Fugene6 from Roche. The p2.1 and pTK-Renilla
plasmids were a kind gift from Dr. Gregg Semenza (Johns
Hopkins School of Medicine) and have been characterized
previously (19). After 6 hours, HUVEC cell lysates were analyzed with a Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay kit from Promega
(Cat# 1910). These experiments were repeated 3 independent
times with representative data reported. Human HIF-regulated
cDNA plate array from Signosis, Inc. (Cat# AP-0111) was
conducted as per instructions from the manufacturer. These
experiments were repeated 3 independent times with representative data reported.
Gene expression proﬁling
Normal prostate samples from organ donors (n ¼ 23) were
obtained as described previously (20). CRPC specimens (n ¼
18) were autopsy specimens from 6 patients who died from
PCa, as previously reported (21). The use of autopsy specimens
for molecular analysis was approved by the Johns Hopkins
Medicine Institutional Review Boards. Gene expression proﬁling was conducted 3 independent times according to the
guidelines provided by the Agilent Whole Genome Expression
Microarray system (Agilent Technologies), using 2-color
design and the results normalized to a reference sample
derived from benign prostatic hyperplasia using the standard
locally weighted least squares regression procedure as
described previously (22).
Statistics
All of the values reported are presented as means  SE of
representative data generated from 1 of a minimum of 3
independent experiments in which there were a minimum of
5 replicates per data point. Statistical analysis was conducted
by a 1-way ANOVA with the Newman–Keuls test for multiple
comparisons.

Human cancer cells are severely stressed when xenografted

plugs initially lack a blood supply. Thus, cancer organoids
must initiate an angiogenic switch, both to survive in this

maintains serum drug concentration at 0.5 to 1 mmol/L (3), is
initiated upon inoculation of Matrigel containing 15 to 20 mgs
of CWR22-RH human CRPC tissue suspension into castrated
male nude mice, 80% of animals (n ¼ 10) are cured and tumor
growth in the remaining 20% is profoundly inhibited (P <

develop an adequate tumor blood vessel density and the
cancers grow eventually killing the host. If animals are initiated
on daily TasQ after tumors grow to a starting size of 0.250 cc,
the cancers do not regress, but subsequent growth is profoundly inhibited (P < 0.05; Fig. 1B). Growth inhibition is
associated with 50% lower (P < 0.05) tumor blood vessel density

To clarify why TasQ is maximally effective when the tumor
microenvironment is most compromised, in vitro experiments
were used. Under standard culture conditions (5% CO2/21%O2/
pH7.2 media), human PC cells (LNCaP, LAPC-4, and CWR22Rv1) and HUVECs grow exponentially with doubling times of
approximately 2 days. Under these standard conditions, TasQ
inhibits growth (P < 0.05) with IC50 values of approximately 50
mmol/L for cancer and endothelial cells, values 50- to 100-fold
higher than therapeutic blood levels (Fig. 1C). This raises the
issue of whether TasQ's potency and/or efﬁcacy for growth
inhibition and/or cell death are increased in a stressful microenvironment. To evaluate this, LNCaPs and HUVECs were
treated with 1 mmol/L TasQ (a dose that had no effect under
standard in vitro conditions, but was therapeutic in vivo) in low
glucose/high CO2/low O2/acidic media to mimic the stressful
microenvironment within cancer sites. Under these compromised conditions, untreated LNCaPs and HUVECs survive, but

 12 hours for LNCaP and 47  7 to 64  8 hours for HUVEC;
P < 0.05). Addition of 1 mmol/L TasQ to such a compromised
condition further decreases doubling time of HUVECs (88  9

To evaluate whether TasQ also inhibits the functional response of endothelial cells, 3D in vitro angiogenic sprouting/
tube formation assays were used. When HUVECs grown on
microcarrier beads are embedded in ﬁbrin gels with media
conditioned by normal lung ﬁbroblasts to provide angiogenic
factors (e.g., VEGF), typically secreted by cancer cells in a
hypoxic microenvironment, cells "sprout" producing canalized
neovessel tubes within 1 week (Fig. 1D). If TasQ is added at

allowed to preform 3D neovessels and then TasQ is added, no
regression occurs even at 50 mmol/L. These results document
that TasQ's inhibition of cancer cells survival and endothelial
angiogenic responses are profoundly enhanced by a stressful
microenvironment.
Tasquinimod suppresses hypoxia-induced decrease in
histone acetylation without lowering HDAC expression
or directly inhibiting HDAC activity
Survival in a stressful hypoxic microenvironment requires
epigenetic reprogramming in which global transcription is
decreased via decreased global histone acetylation, coupled
with increased transcription of a select group of survival genes
(23–26). Decreased global histone acetylation stimulated by
hypoxia (2% O2) was conﬁrmed in human PC lines and TasQ

cells (Fig. 2B), using the appropriate antibodies. Likewise,
human prostate cancer lines characteristically express all of
the class I isotypes and HDAC4, with most also expressing
HDAC6, but only CWR22-Rv1 cells express HDAC5 and only
LNCaP cells express HDAC9, respectively (Fig. 2B and C).
HUVEC cells express HDAC2, 3, and 8 of the class I and HDAC4
and 7of the class IIa and HDAC6 of the class IIb isotypes (Fig.
2D and E). Interestingly, human prostate cancer lines express
3- to 5-fold higher total HDAC activity than endothelial cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1). At 1 mmol/L, TasQ treatment does not
lower the expression of any isotypes expressed by human PC
lines (Fig. 2C and D) or HUVECs (Fig. 2D and E). TasQ even at
100 mmol/L does not inhibit total HDAC enzymatic activity in
HUVECs or a series of human PC lines (LNCaP, CWR22-Rv1,

inhibits this decrease (Fig. 2A). Trichostatin A (TSA) a known
pan-class I/II HDAC inhibitor (27) likewise inhibits decrease
in lysine 9/19 acetylated H3-histone (Fig. 2A). These results
suggest TasQ might be an HDAC inhibitor.
There are multiple isotypes of class I (HDAC1, 2, 3, and 8),
class IIa (HDAC4, 5, 7, and 9) and IIb HDACs (HDAC6; 27).
Normal human prostate epithelial cells (957E/hTERT) express all of the class I and IIb (HDAC6) isotypes, but HDAC4
is the only class IIa isotype consistently detectable in these cells
(Fig. 2B). The lack of detectable expression of the other class IIa
isotypes by normal prostate epithelial cells is not due to the
quality of the antibodies used for detection, as a positive
control HDAC5 is detected in CWR22-Rv1 cell (Fig. 2C), HDAC7
in MCF-7 (data not shown), and HDAC9 is detected in LNCaP

PC3, or PAC-MetUT1; Supplementary Fig. S1). This inability
was conﬁrmed using recombinant human proteins of type I
(HDAC1, 3, and 8), type IIa (HDAC4), and type IIb (HDAC6)
isotypes in biochemical assays.
Tasquinimod binds allosterically within the regulatory
Zinc domain of HDAC4
Previous studies document an enhanced level of HDAC4
protein within PC nuclei in patients with CRPC and that
suppression of HDAC4 expression causes in vitro growth
inhibition of a variety of solid malignancies, including PC,
particularly during hypoxic stress (28–30). Gene expression
array data document that HDAC4 is overexpressed by more
than 3-fold (P < 0.05) in metastatic sites in patients with
CRPC (n ¼ 18) compared with normal prostate from organ
donors (n ¼ 23; Supplementary Fig. S2A). PC lines express
more than 5-fold higher levels of HDAC4 protein than
normal prostate epithelial cells, the majority of which is
in the nucleus (Supplementary Fig. S2B). HDAC4 is 1,084
amino acids (AA) with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) at
AA244-279, a nuclear export signal (NES) at AA1051-1084,
and 3 serines at AA246, 467,and 632 whose phosphorylation
is required for binding 14-3-3, which restricts localization to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A; ref. 31). While HDAC4 lacks
intrinsic DNA-binding activity, sequences within either
the N-terminal adaptor domain (AA1-648) or the C-terminal
HDAC domain (AA648-1051) selectively bind a subset of
DNA anchoring transcription factors as part of either
repressive or stimulatory complexes at speciﬁc promoter/
enhancers (31).
Within the HDAC domain, there is a zinc-bound "catalytic domain" involving AA802-950, however HDAC4 is
enzymatically inactive against classic acetylated peptide
substrates (14, 15). Also within the HDAC domain is a
regulatory zinc-binding domain (ZRD; AA648-751; Fig.
3A). Crystallography studies document that the ZRD has
2 alternative conformations (17). When Zn2þ is coordinated
by C667, C669, H675, and C751, the ZRD is in an active
conformation allowing binding to the transcriptional corepressor, N-CoR/HDAC3 complex via RD3 domain of N-CoR
(14, 17). In the HDAC4/N-CoR/HDAC3 complex, HDAC3 is
active and deacetylates proteins tethered to the complex via
binding to HDAC4 (15). Alternatively, when H665, C667,
H678, and C751 are coordinated with the structural Zn2þ,
the ZRD is in an inactive conformation unable to bind
N-CoR/HDAC3 (17).
Using published crystal structures (17), TasQ docking
was conducted based upon energy miminization modeling.
This modeling identiﬁed a speciﬁc allosteric binding site
for TasQ within the inactive conformation of the ZRD,
distinct from the catalytic domain (Fig. 3B). Critically,
speciﬁc amino acid interactions involved in this binding
are only possible in inactive, not active, conformation of the
ZRD (Fig. 3C). TasQ was immobilized onto a Biacore chip
via an amino linker and binding of human recombinant fulllength HDAC4 protein was determined using SPR. These
studies showed that TasQ binds HDAC4 with a Kd of 10 to
30 nmol/L (Fig. 3D). Additional SPR studies determined that

1392

TasQ binds to human recombinant full length HDAC4
protein immobilized onto a Biacore chip in a 1:1 manner.
SPR analysis documented that recombinant human HDAC4
in which the C669 and H675 in the ZRD are mutated to
alanine preventing formation of the active conformation
(17) retains high afﬁnity binding for TasQ (Supplementary
Fig. S3A).
Tasquinimod phenocopies HDAC4 knockdown in
endothelial and prostate cancer cells
A series of speciﬁc and nonspeciﬁc HDAC4 shRNA lentiviral constructs were tested for their ability to downregulate
HDAC4 in LNCaP cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). The best
construct (shRNA2) was then used to transduce LNCaP and
HUVEC cells. In multiple transductions, cells that grew out
following such shRNA2 transduction had only approximately
60% HDAC4 knockdown (Fig. 4A). Even as little as a 60%
reduction in HDAC4 completely inhibits HUVECs from
sprouting in 3D assays (Fig. 4B), which is an identical
response induced in wild type HUVECs by 1 mmol/L
TasQ (Fig. 1D). With regard to LNCaP cells, such limited
HDAC4 reduction had little effect upon growth rate under
these standard nonstressed conditions (Fig. 4C). In contrast,
however, under even the limited stress of exposure to 2% O2,
without increasing CO2 and decreasing pH, 60% knockdown
of HDAC4 decreases survival of LNCaPs, which is a response
identical to treatment with 1 mmol/L TasQ under such
limited stress (Fig. 4C, bottom).
TasQ also phenocopies the response to HDAC4 knockdown in vivo. Similar to the situation where PCs are nontumorigenic when TasQ treatment is initiated at inoculation (Fig. 1B), HDAC4 shRNA2 knockdown LNCaPs are also
nontumorigenic in mice (Supplementary Fig. S3C and S3D).
The speciﬁcity of this response was documented by the
fact that restoration of HDAC4 expression in shRNA2 knock
down LNCaPs (Fig. 4D) restores their tumorigenicity (Fig. 4E
and Supplementary Fig. S3E).
Tasquinimod blocks the formation of HDAC4/N-CoR/
HDAC3 complexes
SPR analysis documents that full-length HDAC4 protein
immobilized onto a Biacore chip binds human recombinant
full length N-CoR with a Kd of 1 nmol/L and that TasQ
inhibits this binding in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A).
In co-IP/IB assays, HDAC4/N-CoR complex formation is
Znþ2 dependent because it is blocked by EDTA (Fig. 5B).
TasQ also blocks such complex formation with an IC50
value of less than 50 nmol/L (Fig. 5C). To evaluate this
blockade in a cell-based system, HEK-293T human embryonic kidney cells were transfected with HDAC4. Co-IP/IB
analyses documented that TasQ inhibits N-CoR/HDAC3
binding to HDAC4 with an IC50 < 1 mmol/L in normoxia
(20% O2; Fig. 5D and E), and hypoxia (2% O2; Fig. 5E). To
evaluate whether these results are unique to HEK-293Ts,
LNCaPs were transfected with HDAC3. Co-IP/IB analyses
document that TasQ inhibits the binding of HDAC4 to
N-CoR/HDAC3 complexes within PCs with an IC50 of less
than 1 mmol/L (Fig. 5F).

Tasquinimod phenocopies loss of HIF-1a transcriptional
stress response induced by HDAC4 knockdown
TasQ should inhibit HDAC4 client protein deacetylation
via blocking colocalization of N-CoR associated HDAC3 deacetylase activity. One client protein is HIF-1a, which binds
via its ID domain (AA603-785) to the catalytic domain (AA802950) of HDAC4 (Fig. 3A; refs. 30, 32–34). Because of cessation of
hydroxylation of a series of prolines and an asparagine, Hif-1a
accumulates in the nucleus during hypoxia, where it is acetylated by p300/CBP associated factor (PCAF) acetyltransferase
on a series of lysines between AA10–21 and on AA674
(30, 35, 36). The N-terminal acetylated lysines are within DNA
binding domain of HIF-1a (37) and are deacetylated by an
HDAC4 dependent mechanism (30). Such HDAC4 binding to
the ID of HIF-1a also competitively inhibits binding of factor
inhibiting HIF-1a and instead facilitates binding of p300HAT
and dimerization with HIF-1b to form transcriptionally active
HIF-1 at HREs within promoter/enhancers of hypoxic responsive genes (19, 34). shRNA2 knockdown of HDAC4 prevents
deacetylation of N-terminal lysines of HIF-1a enhancing its

degradation, inhibiting its transcriptional activity, and
decreasing cell survival under stressful conditions (30, 33).
To conﬁrm these observations, HIF-1a was compared
between control, HDAC4 shRNA2 knockdown, and knockdown-restored LNCaPs. As expected, HDAC4 knockdown
decreases HIF-1a and this is reversed when HDAC4 is
restored (Fig. 4D). If TasQ inhibits HDAC4/N-CoR/
HDAC3-dependent N-terminal lysine deacetylation of HIF1a, then it should decrease HIF-1a that suppresses HIF-1dependent transcription. When HEK-293T cells were transfected with HDAC4, HIF-1a is decreased by TasQ (Fig. 6A).
To determine if this is due to inhibition of HIF-1a/HDAC4
complex formation, LNCaPs transfected with HDAC4 were
treated with TasQ under both normoxic (21% O2) and
hypoxic (2% O2) conditions. IB of total cell extracts showed
that hypoxia increases HIF-1a coupled with decreasing its
(Fig. 6B). Decreased HIF-1a mobility is due to phosphorylation that enhances its transcriptional activity (38). Co-IP/

50% under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Fig. 6B).
The inhibitory effect of TasQ is not dependent upon over
expression of HDAC4, because it suppresses HIF-1a by more
than 50% under hypoxic conditions in nuclear extracts from
nontransfected LNCaPs (Fig. 6C). Nuclear extracts from
nontransfected LNCaPs were co-IP with an antiacetyl lysine
antibody and the IP analyzed by IB with anti-HIF-1a antibody. Even though TasQ decreases nuclear HIF-1a by more
than 2-fold in the LNCaPs (Fig. 6C), acetylated HIF-1a
increases by 40% (Fig. 6D). Thus, TasQ inhibits the nuclear
fraction of N-terminal HIF-1a lysines deacetylated under
hypoxic conditions by more than 3-fold.
On the basis of its inhibition of HIF-1a deacetylation,
TasQ should inhibit HIF-1a-dependent transcription.

stably integrated a HIF-1a-dependent HRE-driven GFP construct was evaluated to test this prediction. Like LNCaP,
PC-3 predominantly has nuclear HDAC4 (Supplementary
Fig. S2B) and HIF-1a even under normoxic conditions.
In both conditions, PC-3s sense "stress" as documented by
their expression of GFP. While this stress response is much
greater (i.e., >100-fold increase in GFP production) under
hypoxic conditions, TasQ inhibits GFP expression under
both conditions (Fig. 6E).
To further evaluate the generality of TasQ's ability to
inhibit HIF-1a-driven survival signaling in prostate cancer
cells, lactate dehydrogenase-A (LDH-A) protein expression
was determined in LNCaP cancer cells exposed to 1 mmol/L
TasQ under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. These

HIF-1a transcriptional target (19), is increased by hypoxia

Figure 7. A, overview of TasQ's mechanism of action. Under hypoxia/stressful microenvironment conditions, HDAC4/N-CoR/HDAC3 complex binds via
HDAC4 to DNA-bound transcription factors, allowing HDAC3 to deacetylate histones locally repressing basal transcription within the nucleus of
endothelial and cancer cells. Also during such stress, HIF-1a accumulates in the nuclei where PCAF acetylates its N-terminal lysines between AA11–21 and at
position 674 in its inhibitory domain (ID). HDAC4/N-CoR/HDAC3 complexes bind via HDAC4 to the acetylated lysine 674 in the ID of HIF-1 colocalizing N-CoR/
HDAC3, resulting in deacetylation of N-terminal lysines between AA11–21 of HIF-1, facilitating binding of p300HAT and HIF-1b needed for formation of HIF-1
complex, which via p300 acetylates histones in cell survival/angiogenesis genes, stimulating their transcription. TasQ binding allosterically locks ZRD of
HDAC4 in an inactive conformation, preventing basal gene repression and survival/angiogenesis gene transcription needed for the angiogenic switch. B,

bound at the promoter/enhancers of genes (Fig. 7A). HDAC4
binding with the majority of its client DNA bound-transcription factors results in decreased histone acetylation due to
colocalization of HDAC3 repressing their transcription (31;
(Fig. 7A). This explains how TasQ inhibits hypoxia stimulated
global histone deacetylation (Fig. 1D). TasQ binding to HDAC4
also prevents HIF-1a/HDAC4/N-CoR/HDAC3 complex formation. This is critical because the stability and thus the transcriptional activity of HIF-1a needed for both cancer cells
survival and endothelial cells angiogenesis is inhibited when its
N-terminal lysines are acetylated and HDAC4 is required for
their full deacetylation (Fig. 7A).
On the basis of this HDAC4 allosteric binding, TasQ should
be effective when used as monotherapy against multiple
types of solid malignancies because ablating HDAC4 signaling not only inhibits endothelial tumor angiogenesis, but also
growth/survival of a variety of human organ-speciﬁc cancers
(29, 30, 39, 40). To evaluate this possibility, a series of human
prostate, breast, bladder, and colon cancer xenografts were
inoculated into appropriate immune-suppressed hosts and
cancers allowed to reach 0.250 cc before daily oral TasQ
(10 mg/kg/d) was initiated. As predicted, TasQ monotherapy inhibited (P < 0.05) subsequent tumor growth by
a least 50% in all of these cancer types (Fig. 7B).
Because TasQ's potency and efﬁcacy for inhibition of
cancer cell survival and endothelial angiogenic response are
enhanced in a stressful tumor microenvironment, combining TasQ with agents that increase tumor microenvironmental stress should enhance therapeutic efﬁcacy. To test
this prediction, TasQ was combined with G202, which is a
Thapsigargin prodrug engineered to be hydrolyzed to a
cytotoxin by a protease uniquely expressed by cancer associated endothelial cells to selectively kill tumor endothelial
cells enhancing a more stressful tumor microenvironment
(12). When estrogenized female nude mice are inoculated
with MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and cancers allowed
to grow to a starting size of approximately 0.2 cc before
animals are given a single cycle of 2 daily IV injections of 56
mg/kg of G202, cancers regress due to the death of tumor
associated endothelial and cancer cells and in a subset of
animals, the cancers does not regrow (12). If such breast,
cancers are allowed to grow to a starting size of approximately 0.8 cc before initiating a single 2-day cycle with G202,
cancers regress by more than 50% followed by regrowth (Fig.
7C). While daily TasQ treatment (10 mg/kg/d) initiated when
the breast cancers are approximately 0.8 cc inhibits subsequent tumor growth, no regression of these large cancers
occurs (Fig. 7C). In contrast, combining daily TasQ with
G202 treatment results in regression of these large cancers,
but now regrowth is inhibited (P < 0.05; Fig. 7C).

microenvironment, an epigenetic adaptive survival response,
termed the angiogenic switch, is activated involving reciprocal
interactions between cancer cells and tumor host inﬁltrating
cells including MDSC, macrophages, and endothelial cells,
(7–9). This angiogenic switch facilitates global repression of
transcription coupled with selective expression of speciﬁc
stress–response genes via type IIa HDAC4 dependent colocalization of type I HDAC3 deacetylase activity at speciﬁc promoter/enhancers in cancer and host tumor inﬁltrating cells
(refs. 30, 33; Fig. 7A). The importance of such deacetylase
activity is documented by ability of pan- and type 1 isotype
selective HDAC inhibitors to suppress cancer growth via
reduced tumor angiogenesis (30, 33). Limitation with using
pan- or type 1 isotype selective HDAC inhibitors, however, is
that they upregulate, instead of repress, transcription of a
subset of unwanted survival genes [e.g., GRP78/BiP, Cox-2,
ﬁbroblast growth factor (FGF2), and Slit2; refs. 41–46)]. Thus,
selective inhibition of HDAC4 signaling is a more optimal
approach for blocking the angiogenic switch without activating unwanted survival signaling within cancer sites.
The present studies identify TasQ as such a high afﬁnity
HDAC4 selective negative allosteric modulator. Besides allosterically binding HDAC4, TasQ also binds with high afﬁnity
to the calcium binding protein, S100A9 (7, 16). In the presence
of zinc, S100A9 undergoes a conformational change becoming
a ligand for the proinﬂammatory Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)
and TasQ binding to S100A9 inhibits this binding to TLR4 (7).
This is signiﬁcant because MDSCs from the bone marrow
circulate in the blood and express S100A9 protein and TLR4
and S100A9 binding to TLR4 stimulates tumor inﬁltration of
MDSCs (7, 47, 48). Under hypoxic conditions, tumor inﬁltrating DSC differentiate via HIF-1a-dependent transcription
into tumor-associated macrophages (TAM; ref. 49). Once differentiated, TAMs secrete angiogenic factors such as VEGF,
FGF, TNF- a, and TGF-b (50). Thus, TasQ's can suppress tumor
angiogenesis due to inhibition of S100A9/TLR4-dependent
MDSCs tumor inﬁltration and/or to inhibition of HDAC4/
N-CoR/HDAC3-dependent deacetylation of HIF-1a by MDSCs
suppressing their differentiation into TAMs. Presently, the
relative importance of both of these complementary TasQ
targets for anticancer efﬁcacy is being evaluated in preclinical
models. Regardless of the results of these additional studies,
the present studies document that TasQ's therapeutic anticancer efﬁcacy is enhanced when combined with an additional
drug (e.g., G202), which produces a more stressful tumor
microenvironment.

Solid malignancies outgrow their blood supply producing a
hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Such tumor hypoxia
enhances glycolysis and amino-acid catabolism increasing
lactic acid secretion producing an acidic extracelluar microenvironment coupled with nutrient limitation (e.g., glucose
