ABSTRACT
The membrane bound glycoprotein mesothelin (MSLN) is a highly specific tumor
marker, which is currently exploited as target for drugs. There are only limited
data available on MSLN expression by human tumors. Therefore we determined
overexpression of MSLN across different tumor types with Functional Genomic mRNA
(FGM) profiling of a large cancer database. Results were compared with data in articles
reporting immunohistochemical (IHC) MSLN tumor expression. FGM profiling is a
technique that allows prediction of biologically relevant overexpression of proteins
from a robust data set of mRNA microarrays. This technique was used in a database
comprising 19,746 tumors to identify for 41 tumor types the percentage of samples
with an overexpression of MSLN compared to a normal background. A literature search
was performed to compare the FGM profiling data with studies reporting IHC MSLN
tumor expression. FGM profiling showed MSLN overexpression in gastrointestinal
(12–36%) and gynecological tumors (20–66%), non-small cell lung cancer (21%)
and synovial sarcomas (30%). The overexpression found in thyroid cancers (5%)
and renal cell cancers (10%) was not yet reported with IHC analyses. We observed
that MSLN amplification rate within esophageal cancer depends on the histotype
(31% for adenocarcinomas versus 3% for squamous-cell carcinomas). Subset analysis
in breast cancer showed MSLN amplification rates of 28% in triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC) and 33% in basal-like breast cancer. Further subtype analysis of TNBCs
showed the highest amplification rate (42%) in the basal-like 1 subtype and the
lowest amplification rate (9%) in the luminal androgen receptor subtype.

with immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses showed high
MSLN expression in 100% of the epithelial mesotheliomas,
90–100% of pancreatic and 66–100% of ovarian cancers.
This is of interest as these tumors largely lack targets for
targeted agents. MSLN is also known to be overexpressed
to a lesser extent in multiple other human cancers such as
endometrial, lung, stomach, triple negative breast, cervical,
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and head and neck
cancers (HNSCC) [3–8].

INTRODUCTION
Mesothelin (MSLN) is a membrane bound
glycoprotein with only limited expression in normal
tissues such as mesothelial cells lining pleural, pericardial
and peritoneal surfaces [1]. This makes it an interesting
target for anticancer drugs. Its function is largely unknown.
In mice inactivation of the MSLN gene produced
physiologically normal, fertile offspring without any
anatomical or histological abnormalities. This demonstrated
no essential role for MSLN for growth in mice [2]. Studies

these drugs target molecular drivers of tumor growth with
the goal to inhibit their downstream effects in a tumor cell.
In contrast, novel drugs are becoming available that target
over-expressed tumor specific antigens such as MSLN
that have no clear role in tumor genesis. Among these
novel drugs are the antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs),
which combine the specific targeting of an antibody with
the potency of cytotoxins that would alone cause severe
dose-limiting toxicities [9–11]. Critical for ADC efficacy
is overexpression of a target antigen at the cell membrane
of tumor cells. After internalization the toxic load is
activated.
The same mechanism of action is exploited by
immunotoxins, which consist of a targeting antibody
(fragment) fused with a toxin. An interesting example
targeting MSLN is the immunotoxin SS1P, comprising a
portion of a Pseudomonas exotoxin [12].
Another
strategy
targeting
tumor
cells
overexpressing a certain antigen is immunotherapy.
An example are the cancer vaccines such as GVAX, a
combination of two irradiated, granulocyte-macrophage
colony stimulating factor secreting allogeneic pancreatic
cancer cell lines which were administered to patients
with irresectable or metastasized pancreatic cancer.
The cancer cell lines were combined with recombinant
live-attenuated, double-deleted Listeria monocytogenes,
engineered to secrete MSLN into the cytosol of infected
antigen presentation cells. The combination of these two
agents induces an in vivo immune response to mesothelin
expressing pancreatic cancer cells [13].
Additionally,
chimeric
antigen
receptor
(CAR)-engineered T cells using MSLN as a target are
developed as adoptive T cell immunotherapy in patients
[14]. Three clinical trials are ongoing (NCT01355965,
NCT01583686, NCT02159716) and two partial responses
(PR) were already reported; one in a patient with
pancreatic cancer and one patient with malignant pleural
mesothelioma [15].
Although several IHC studies are performed
evaluating percentages of MSLN overexpression, these
numbers may not reflect the actual percentages of tumors
with useful MSLN expression as they are based on small
numbers of tumors per type, different assays and different
definitions of positivity.
We have recently developed a method called
functional genomic mRNA (FGM) profiling that
corrects gene expression data (i.e. mRNA expression
data) for major, non-genetic, factors (e.g. physiological,
metabolic, cell-type-specific and experimental factors)
[16]. We observed that the residual gene expression
signal (i.e. FGM profile) correlated strongly with somatic
copy number alterations (SCNAs) in cancer samples. In
other words, with FGM profiling we are capturing the
downstream effect of SCNAs at gene expression levels.
FGM profiling is particularly useful because of the
public availability of microarray expression profiles for
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

thousands of cancer samples. We applied this method to
publicly available expression data of 19,746 unrelated,
patient-derived tumor samples to gain more detailed
information about the position of MSLN as a generalizable
drug target in 41 tumor types and compared this data to
currently existing IHC data from literature.

RESULTS
Mesothelin expression analyzed by FGM
profiling
The median number of samples per tumor type
was 161, ranging from 21 for thyroid cancer to 7,270 for
breast cancer. The number of samples per tumor type in
combination with the predicted percentage of samples
with a MSLN amplification is shown in Fig. 1.
Predicted amplification of MSLN was most
frequently found in gynecological tumors, gastrointestinal
tumors, NSCLC (21% of N = 612) and in synovial
sarcoma (30% of N = 34). In ovarian cancer 66% of 1,255
tumors had a predicted MSLN amplification and in cervical
cancers (N = 114) this was 20%. Highest predicted MSLN
amplification rate for gastrointestinal cancer was seen in
pancreatic adenocarcinomas (36% of N = 121), followed
by gastric cancers (24% of N = 212) and colorectal cancers
(21% of N = 1,131). A predicted MSLN amplification
rate of 13% was seen for esophageal cancer (N = 185),
which was mainly driven by the subset of esophageal
adenocarcinomas with an MSLN amplification rate
of 31% (N = 64). In contrast, for esophageal squamouscell carcinomas only a MSLN amplification rate of 3%
(N = 109) was observed.
Additionally, predicted MSLN amplifications
were found in 9% of the renal cell carcinomas (N = 428
tumors), 5% of the thyroid cancers (N = 21 tumors), 5% of
acute myeloid leukemias (N = 761 tumors) and 4% of the
HNSCC (N = 356 tumors).
We observed a predicted MSLN amplification rate of
10% in the total set of breast cancer samples (N = 7,270).
Within the subset of estrogen receptor (ER) positive
(N = 4,906) and within the subset of human epidermal
growth factor 2 (HER2) positive (N = 1,580) breast cancer
samples the MSLN amplification rate was 3% and 7%,
respectively (Table 1). The observed MSLN amplification
rate within the subset of TNBC samples (N = 1,555)
was 28%. Within the subset of breast cancer samples
for which we were informed on the molecular subtype
classification, we observed a high MSLN amplification
rate within the basal-like subtype (33% of N = 378). After
applying the TNBC sub-classification according to Lehman
et al. on the subset of TNBC samples we observed the
highest MSLN amplification rate (42%) within the basal-like
1 class (N = 282). The lowest amplification rate (9%) was
observed for the luminal androgen receptor class (N = 164).

Mesothelin expression measured
immunohistochemically in published papers

endometrioid uterine adenocarcinoma (59–64%), cervical
(25%), pancreatic (86–100%), colorectal (28–50%),
esophageal (25–46%) and gastric carcinoma (27–58%)
[5, 15, 17, 18, 20–24]. Percentages of breast cancer with
MSLN overexpression varied between studies, probably
due to different subtypes being analyzed. In N = 43 triple
negative breast cancer (TNBC) samples, 67% was MSLN
positive, while in other sub types comprising 29 ER positive
and 27 HER2 positive, this was below 5% [7]. Others
reported a high MSLN expression in 36% of TBNC samples,
compared to 16% in non-TNBC samples [8]. In Table 2 IHC
MSLN expression data are shown per tumor type.

We identified 14 published papers in which IHC
staining for MSLN was described for a total of 2,846
tumor samples [1, 5–8, 17–26]. The number of samples
analyzed per tumor type ranged from 3 (gastrointestinal
stromal tumors) to 1,209 samples (NSCLC) with a median
of 20 per tumor type. IHC was performed with a total of
5 different anti-MSLN staining antibodies and 13 different
scoring systems. The most frequently used antibody
(9 out of the 15 studies) is the 5B2 monoclonal antibody
from Novocastra [5, 18–21, 24, 25, 27]. Other staining
antibodies were K1,5B2 from Thermo-scientific, 5B2 from
Vector Laboratories, 22A31 and K1 [1, 7, 8, 22, 23]. For
all 15 studies, 13 different scoring strategies were applied.
Only the Ordonez papers [18, 19] used the same scoring
system, and also Kachala [6] and Tozbikian [8] used the
same method.
The most MSLN over-expressing tumor types were
synovial sarcoma (100%) ovarian (50–88%), NSCLC,

MSLN overexpression by functional genomic
mRNA profiling versus IHC
The patterns of MSLN overexpression are largely
comparable between the historical IHC data and our data
gathered with FGM profiling. The percentages of tumor
samples that showed MSLN over-expression or predicted
MSLN amplification differ between the two techniques,

predicted MSLN amplification in gynecological tumors,
gastrointestinal tumors, NSCLC and synovial sarcomas. In
addition, our technique revealed not yet reported predicted
MSLN amplifications in 10% of renal cell cancers and 5%
of thyroid cancers. In addition, we observed that MSLN
amplification rate within esophageal cancer depends
on the histotype (31% for adenocarcinomas versus 3%
for squamous-cell carcinomas). Subtype analysis in
breast cancer showed MSLN amplification rates of 28%
in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and 33% in basallike breast cancer. Within the TNBCs the basal-like 1
subtype showed the highest amplification rate (42%)
and the luminal androgen receptor subtype the lowest
amplification rate (9%).
This data suggests which percentages of tumor
types potentially might benefit from treatment with MSLN
targeting immunotoxins or ADCs. For mesothelioma,
pancreatic and ovarian cancer, drugs are currently in

with on average higher percentages for the IHC data.
For example, NSCLC shows in 69% of tumors an overexpression based on IHC, while we find a predicted MSLN
amplification rate for NSCLC of 21%. The same is true for
the synovial sarcomas, colorectal, pancreatic and gastric
cancers. This does not account for all tumors, as 50–88%
of ovarian cancers are considered MSLN positive based
on IHC, while with our technique we find 66% of ovarian
cancer samples having a predicted MSLN amplification.
For renal cell and thyroid cancer, IHC studies were
performed, although in small numbers of tumors (N = 33
for renal cell, and N = 14 and N = 29 for thyroid cancer).

DISCUSSION
This is the first paper studying MSLN expression
in a large database of human tumors with a novel method
called FGM profiling. We showed high percentages of

development that target MSLN [3, 12, 15, 28, 29].
However, also for the lower percentages of MSLN
over-expressing tumors within other tumor types overexpression of MSLN could be an interesting target. In
this era of individualized treatment, tumor histology types
alone do not have to determine which therapy will be
most effective. Increasingly, drug development focuses on
tumor characteristics and targeting these, than on tumor
type alone.
IHC is most often applied for a semi-quantitative
analysis of protein expression in tumor samples. However,
IHC studies have well-known disadvantages, the first
being highly heterogeneous scoring methods between
different studies. For example, Frierson et al. classified
MSLN protein expression as 1+ when only 1–10% of
tumor cells showed positive staining, while others use
a combination of staining intensity and percentage of
positive stained tumor cells [5–8, 18, 20–26]. Moreover,
different staining antibodies have been used in the
different studies. This makes it currently difficult to
compare IHC patterns in different studies of different
tumor types. Also it precludes a general cut off for IHC
indicating over-expression of MSLN. If a relevant target,
standardization of IHC for MSLN would be clearly
required. FGM profiling provides a rapid screening tool
for potentially drugable targets in a large set of tumors,
but also has some drawbacks. No quantitative analysis
is possible and there is no direct correlation between the
FGM profile and protein levels of the genes investigated.
Moreover, it is not possible determine heterogeneity in
expression between tumor cells or to determine which cell
type in the tumor tissue expresses MSLN.
The advantages of FGM profiling however prevail
and include that predicted MSLN amplification rates
between tumor types are directly comparable as the same

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

threshold is used. In addition, the large number of samples
included in this analysis and the broad spectrum of tumor
types allow for robust estimations of predicted MSLN
amplification rates. FGM profiling may also be useful in
determining over-expression of other potentially drugable
targets in different tumor types. This highly facilitates
prioritization of tumor types for future research in which
the clinical benefit of targeting MSLN with immunotoxins
or ADCs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Functional genomic mRNA profiling
For a detailed description of FGM profiling we refer
to Fehrmann et al. [16]. In short, we analyzed 77,840
expression profiles of publicly available samples with
principal component analysis (PCA) and found that a
limited number of ‘Transcriptional Components’ (TCs)
capture the major regulators of the mRNA transcriptome.
Subsequently, we identified a subset of TCs that described
non-genetic regulatory factors. We used these non-genetic
TCs as covariates to correct microarray expression data
and observed that the residual expression signal (i.e. FGM
profile) captures the downstream consequences of genomic
alterations on gene expression levels.

Identification of 19,746 unrelated,
patient-derived tumor samples
As described in more detail in Fehrmann et al, we
were able to construct a set of 15,878 unrelated tumor
samples of patients. In short, each of the 77,840 samples
was annotated with MeSH terms based on an automatic
text-mining algorithm. Next, we developed a method to

28169

Oncotarget

exclude cell line samples, as these samples might not
reflect the in vivo situation of cancer cells. Subsequently,
we developed a method that can accurately detect and
exclude genetically identical samples in expression data,
even if two different cell types or tissues had been assayed
for one individual. In addition, we performed a manual
curation to assign each sample to one of 41 tumor types.
Next to these 15,878 tumor samples, we identified an
additional 3,545 breast cancer samples, 114 esophageal
cancer samples, 30 pancreas cancers and 179 HNSCCs.
For the breast cancer samples data on hormone receptor
(ER, PR) and HER2 status was collected including
the cut-off values used to define a positive or negative
receptor status. We used this information to determine
the receptor status of ER, PR and HER2 according to the
latest guidelines as defined by the American Society of
Clinical Oncology [30]. In accordance with this guideline,
for ER and PR status, we used an IHC cut-off value of 1%.
Samples were considered to be HER2-positive when they
reached an IHC score of 3+. In addition, samples with a
HER2 IHC score of 2+ with a HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥ 2.0
were also considered positive. A HER2 IHC score of +1
or 0 was considered negative. If we could not redefine
the receptor status according to the ASCO guidelines, we
explored the empirical expression distributions (regular
mRNA expression and FGmRNA expression) for ER, PR
and HER2 receptor status of negative and positive breast
cancer samples (receptor status defined according to
guidelines). Both ER and PR positive and negative status
was best discriminated by the regular mRNA expression
levels of the Affymetrix probe 205255_at. HER2 positive
and negative receptor status was best discriminated by
the FGmRNA expression level of Affymetrix probe
216836_s_at. We used these probes to infer receptor
status of samples that were missing ER, PR or HER2
status according to guidelines. Thresholds were defined
by selecting the (FG)mRNA expression value that resulted
in the optimal balance in sensitivity between the reported
guideline negative and positive samples. In addition,
we collected all available molecular sub-classifications
(normal-like, basal, luminal A, luminal B and Her2)
for the breast cancer samples [30–32]. For the TBNC
samples we determined the sub-classification according to
Lehmann et al. (basal-like 1, basal-like 2, mesenchymal,
mesenchymal stem-like, immunomodulatory and luminal
androgen receptor) [33].
Finally, we applied FGM profiling to determine the
FGM-landscape in these 19,746 tumor samples.

esophageal cancer and HNSCC) was defined in 18,713
FGM-profiles of non-cancer samples by calculating the
97.5th percentiles for the FGM signal of MSLN. For breast
cancer, pancreas cancer, esophageal cancer and HNSCC
we used tissue type matched healthy samples (172, 77, 47
and 277 samples, respectively) to determine the 97.5th
percentiles for the FGM signal of MSLN.
For each of the 19,746 tumor samples, MSLN was
marked as significantly amplified when the FGM-signal
was above the 97.5th percentile threshold as defined in the
non-cancer samples.

Literature search
To compare the data obtained with FGM profiling
with IHC data in literature, PubMed was searched for
articles published in English during the period 1996 until
January 2015. The following search terms were used:
‘mesothelin’, ‘expression’, ‘cancer’ and ‘tumor’ in various
combinations. The articles that were found were screened
for presence of IHC staining’s of patient derived tumor
tissue. Subsequently, numbers of tumor samples assessed
and percentages of tumor samples that were called MSLN
“positive” by IHC were recorded per tumor type per
article. MSLN positivity was decided to be present when
it was determined as positive in the original article.
