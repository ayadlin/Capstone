ABSTRACT
Ovarian cancer remains the leading cause of death in gynecologic malignancies
partially because of resistance to chemotherapy. In the present study, we show
that RY-2f, a chemically synthesized isoflavone analog, inhibited ovarian cancer cell
proliferation, blocked cell cycle in G2/M phase and induced cellular apoptosis through
up-regulation of p21, cyclin B1, Bax, Bad and cleaved-PARP, and suppression of cyclin
A, CDK2 and Bcl-2. We also show that RY-2f could increase the chemotherapeutic
efficacy of cisplatin as tested by cell proliferation and colony formation assays,
indicating a synergistic effect of RY-2f and cisplatin. Mechanistic study revealed that
RY-2f exerted the anti-tumor activities mainly through suppression of the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR signaling. Finally, in vivo studies showed that RY-2f blocked the A2780-induced
xenograft tumor growth without detectable toxicity in the animals at the therapeutic
doses, and whereas RY-2f re-sensitized the cisplatin resistant cell line A2780/CDDP
induced xenograft tumor to cisplatin treatment. Thus, RY-2f may be developed as a
potential therapeutic agent to treat ovarian cancer.

Numerous investigations have demonstrated that the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling is commonly over-activated
and plays an important role in the stimulation of proliferation,
survival, metastasis, and drug-resistance in many cancer types
[7–10]. Particularly, amplification or mutations of PIK3CA
(encoding the catalytic subunit of PI3K P110α), loss of
PTEN, and deregulation of AKT are well-known mechanisms
that activate this pathway in approximately 70% of ovarian
cancers [11–15]. In addition, studies have also shown that the
activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signal pathway contributes
to the platinum-based resistance and poor prognoses in ovarian
cancer [16–18]. Therefore, to improve the sensitivity of
ovarian cancer cells to platinum-based chemotherapy, targeting
the PI3K/ATK/mTOR signal pathway has emerged as one of
the major therapeutic strategies [19, 20].

INTRODUCTION
Ovarian cancer accounts for only about 3% of
all malignancies in women, but is the leading cause of
death in female reproductive carcinomas [1]. Because
most of ovarian cancer cases are diagnosed at advanced
stages (60–70%), the 5 year survival rate is around 46%
[2].The current standard treatment for ovarian cancer
includes radical surgery and platinum- or taxane-based
chemotherapy [3, 4]. Despite the initial response to
standard treatment, majority of advanced ovarian cancers
recur at a median of 18–24 months after diagnosis [5].
However, drug-resistance has been a major challenge in
treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer [6]. Therefore, it is
urgent to develop novel therapeutic agents for relapsing
ovarian cancer patients, especially for those resistant to
platinum-based chemotherapy.

have been reported to possess chemo-preventive and
chemotherapeutic potentials in both hormone-and nonhormone-dependent tumor types, including ovarian,
prostate, breast, colon, gastric, lung, and pancreatic tumors
[21–23]. Studies from cancer epidemiology revealed that
the intake of soy and isoflavones has a negative association
with ovarian cancer risk [24–26]. Another study showed
that the incidence of ovarian cancer is much lower
in Japan than in Western countries, because Japanese
women consume large amounts of isoflavone-rich soy
foods in their dietary [27]. Additional investigations have
shown that isoflavones, such as genistein, glycitein, and
daidzein, exert in vitro and in vivo pleiotropic anti-tumor
effects through suppression of cell cycle, induction of
apoptosis, inhibition of angiogenesis and metastasis, and
anti-oxidation [22, 28–30]. Hence, isoflavones have been
recognized as promising candidates in the development of
anti-tumor agents.
From a series of synthesized isoflavone analogs,
we identified a novel isoflavone analog, (Z)-N'-(7hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-6-methoxy-4H-chromen4-ylidene) acetohydrazide, named as RY-2f (Figure 1A),
and herein, we report its in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor
functions.

to proliferate and to form a colony. Thus, it has been
used to determine the cytotoxicity induced by various
chemotherapeutic agents [32]. In the present study,
as shown in Figure 1E, treatment of A2780, HEY and
OVCA433 cells with RY-2f at the different concentrations
(2, 4 and 8 μM) for 48 h dose-dependently reduced the
number of colonies, compared with cells treated with
diluent (DMSO). The numbers of colonies formed by cells
treated with RY-2f or diluent were shown in Figure 1F-H.

RY-2f induces cell cycle arrest
Anti-tumor chemicals usually inhibit cell
proliferation through induction of cell cycle arrest.
Therefore, to test how the cell cycle was inhibited by
RY-2f, the DNA-based cell cycle was analyzed by flow
cytometry. We first treated cells with RY-2f for 24 h and
then examined the DNA content after propidium iodide
(PI) staining. We found that the cell population was dosedependently increased in the G2/M phase but decreased in
the S phase in all three cell lines treated with the various
concentrations of RY-2f, when compared with control cells
treated with diluent (Figure 2A). Moreover, the apoptosis
induced by RY-2f was observed as the hypodiploid
DNA content shown in so-called “sub-G1” peaks in
DNA histograms. The cell cycle distribution of the cells
treated with RY-2f or diluent were shown in Figure 2B-D.
These data indicate that RY-2f induces cell cycle arrest
through reducing S phase and accumulating G2/M phase
populations in cancer cells.
Further, we examined the effect of RY-2f on cell
cycle regulatory molecules including p21Cip1, cyclin
A, cyclin B1 and CDK2 by Western blot. As shown in
Figure 2E, treatment of cells with RY-2f dose-dependently
up-regulated p21Cip1 and cyclin B1, but down-regulated
cyclin A and CDK2 in three cell lines. These data suggest
that the G2/M cell cycle arrest caused by RY-2f may be
associated with up-regulation of the cell cycle inhibitory
proteins and down-regulation of the cell cycle transitionpromoting proteins.

RESULTS
RY-2f suppresses cell proliferation
The anti-proliferative activity of RY-2f was initially
tested by using human ovarian carcinoma cells, including
A2780, HEY and OVCA433 cell lines. Cells were treated
with different concentrations of RY-2f for 24, 48, and
72 hours, and the cell viability was determined by MTT
assay. As shown in Figure 1B, treatment of A2780
cells with RY-2f resulted in a corresponding decrease
of cell proliferation and viability in a dose- and timedependent manner. Similar effects were obtained on
treatment of HEY (Figure 1C) and OVCA433 (Figure
1D) cells. The IC50 values were calculated and listed
in Table 1. In contrast, the sensitivity of normal human
ovarian epithelial cells (T29) [31] to RY-2f was much low
(Table 1), suggesting that RY-2f has selective cytotoxicity
on ovarian cancer cells, but possesses less cytotoxicity on
normal ovarian epithelial cells. Moreover, we also tested
the anti-proliferative activities of glycitein (4′, 7-Dihydroxy6-methoxyisoflavone), which is the leading compound
of RY-2f, and another isoflavone compound, genistein
(4′, 5, 7-trihydroxyisoflavone). As listed in Table 1, compared
with RY-2f, glycitein and genistein exhibited weaker effect
on the inhibition of both neoplastic and pre-neoplastic cell
growth, which may indicate that the nitrogen-containing
groups are essential for the anti-cancer activities.
Next, we employed colony formation assay
to further confirm the cytotoxicity of RY-2f. Colony
formation assay is based on the ability of a single cell

RY-2f induces cell apoptosis through
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway
To examine cellular apoptosis, cells doublestained with Annexin-V/PI were subjected to the flow
cytometry analysis. We first treated cells with RY-2f at
the concentrations of 5, 10 and 20 μM for 24 h, and then
stained the cells with Annexin-V and PI. We found that
the total proportion of Annexin V positive cells, including
Annexin V+/PI- (the right lower quadrant, representing
early apoptosis) and Annexin V+/PI+ (the right upper
quadrant, representing late apoptosis and necrosis)
cells, were dose-dependently increased with the raising
concentrations of RY-2f in all three ovarian cancer cell
lines (Figure 3A and 3B).

RY-2f disrupts the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signal
pathway

and Bad in three cell lines after treatment for 24 h, while
β-actin served as a loading control. Moreover, compared
with control cells, the exposure of cells to RY-2f promoted
the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1)
in a dose-dependent manner, which is a marker of cells
undergoing apoptosis. In order to investigate whether
the RY-2f-induced apoptosis is mediated through the
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, Bax was silenced by
a specific siRNA in three cell lines (Figure 3D). The
apoptosis induced by RY-2f were significantly attenuated
by knockdown of Bax in all three cell lines, compared
with control cells (Figure 3E). These results indicate
that RY-2f triggers mitochondrial dependent apoptosis in
ovarian cancer cells.

Several natural compounds or their synthetic
analogs, such as isoflavones and bisflavones, have been
demonstrated to overcome cisplatin resistance in ovarian
carcinoma through suppression of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
signaling [33–35]. Therefore, we employed Western blot
to test whether the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signal pathway
was involved in the RY-2f-mediated anti-cancer effects.
Indeed, as shown in Figure 5A, with the increase of RY-2f
concentration, the phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473 as
well as the expression of mTOR, a known downstream
target of AKT, were dose-dependently suppressed in
A2780, HEY and OVCA433 cells, whereas no changes of
PI3K p110 α and total AKT were observed. Moreover, RY2f up-regulated the expression of PTEN, a key negative
regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway, in all three cell lines.
To further confirm above notion in RY-2f mediated
anti-cancer effects, we transfected A2780, HEY and
OVCA433 cells with a plasmid containing constitutively
active AKT1 (myr-AKT1) or control vector, respectively
(Figure 5B), and then determined the anti-proliferative
effect of RY-2f on the transfected cells. As shown in
Figure 5C, introduction of myr-AKT1 significantly rescued
the anti-proliferative effect of RY-2f. In addition, we also
determined the expression of Bax in cells transfected with
myr-AKT plasmid to explore the association between AKT
phosphorylation and apoptosis-related protein. As shown in
Figure 5D, activation of AKT led to the reduction of RY2f-induced up-regulation of Bax in myr-AKT1 transfected
cells, compared with that in vector-transfected control cells
(Figure 5D). Collectively, these data suggest that RY-2f
exerts its anti-cancer function, at least partially, through
disruption of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signal pathway, which
may consequently result in cellular apoptosis.

RY-2f sensitizes cancer cells to cisplatin treatment
Since the activation of AKT is shown to
contribute to the resistance of platinum therapy in
ovarian cancer [16, 33], we next tested if RY-2f could
improve sensitization of ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin
treatment. We treated A2780 and A2780 cisplatin
resistant cells (A2780/CDDP) with cisplatin alone or
cisplatin plus RY-2f. As shown in Figure 4A, treatment
of cells with cisplatin alone had a fairly low antiproliferative effect, especially on A2780/CDDP cells.
However, the combined administration of cells with RY2f and cisplatin resulted in highly reduced cell growth
at 48 h compared with cisplatin alone. The combination
index (CI) was 0.61 and 0.74, indicating a synergistic
effect (CI < 1) of cisplatin and RY-2f. We then confirmed
the synergistic function of RY-2f in cisplatin-treated
cells by colony formation assay. Concurrent treatment
of A2780 or A2780/CDDP cell lines with both cisplatin
and RY-2f resulted in greater inhibition of colony
formation than did treatment of cells with either agent
alone (Figure 4B and 4C). In addition, the combined
treatment with cisplatin and RY-2f promoted more upregulation of Bax and more cleavage of PARP-1 than
the treatment with either agent alone in three cell lines,
suggesting a strong synergistic induction of apoptosis by
both agents (Figure 4D).

inoculation of A2780 cells in female BALB/C nude mice.

After solid tumor reached to 100 mm3, animals were
randomly divided into two groups and administrated with
either 30 mg/kg of RY-2f or vehicle once every four days.
As shown in Figure 6A, compared with mice treated with
vehicle, animals treated with RY-2f appeared with 55.8%
reduction of tumor growth after 6 administrations (20
days). The average tumor weight from diluent-treated mice
was more than that of RY-2f-treated animals (Figure 6B).
However, no any significant difference of body weights
between RY-2f-treated and diluent-treated mice was
observed (Figure 6C), indicating that RY-2f may own the
property of low toxicity on tested animals.
Furthermore, we tested the growth-inhibitory effect on
xenograft animals generated with A2780/CDDP by CDDP
(10 mg/kg, i.p. per 4 days) or RY-2f (30 mg/kg, i.p. per 4
days) as single agents, or by the combination of CDDP (10
mg/kg, i.p. per 4 days) and RY-2f (30 mg/kg, i.p. per 4 days).
The results showed that CDDP alone was not significantly
effective on reduction of tumor volume. In comparison,
RY-2f treatment and the combinative treatment resulted
in a significant reduction of tumor growth (Figure  6D).
Correspondingly, the tumor weight from RY-2f and
combinative treatment was significantly decreased, compared
with diluent or CDDP treated group (Figure 6E). Besides,
compared with vehicle, CDDP treatment reduced body
weight of mice, while the RY-2f and combined treatment
slightly reduced body weight, but did not reach statistical
significance (Figure 6F). Furthermore, we performed the
immunohistochemistry assay to determine the expression
of p-AKT, PTEN, cyclin A, and Bax in the xenograft
tumor tissues. As shown in Figure 6G, CDDP treatment upregulated the phosphorylation of AKT and cyclin A, while
consistent with the in vitro results, RY-2f treatment decreased
the phosphorylation of AKT and cyclin A in tumor tissues.
The combinative administration further up-regulated the proapoptotic factor Bax. These in vivo findings demonstrate that
RY-2f enhances the anticancer efficacy of cisplatin treatment
in platinum resistant ovarian cancer cells.

complex is responsible for cell cycle progression in late
S phase and early G2 phase and decreases in late G2
phase and mitosis [38]. p21, which belongs to Cip/Kip
family, negatively regulates cell cycle progression through
inhibition of CDK-cyclin complexes [39, 40]. In this
study, we show that RY-2f induces G2/M cell cycle arrest
with down-regulation of cyclin A and CDK2, and upregulation of p21 (Figure 2C), indicating that cancer cells
may exit from G2 phase and enter M phase in response
to RY-2f treatment. Cyclin B1, which is synthesized at
interphase and reaches maximum level at metaphase, has
been identified to regulate the progression from late G2
phase to mitosis as complex with CDK1 [41]. To progress
from metaphase to anaphase, cyclin B1 is degraded
rapidly by the anaphase-promoting complex [42]. Our
results showed that RY-2f significantly up-regulated the
accumulation of cyclin B1, which may indicate that the
accumulation of cyclin B1 finally induced the cell cycle
arrest and programmed cell death [43].
Apoptosis, a major form of cell death, is regulated
by numerous molecular signaling pathways including
mitochondrial pathways. In this pathway, mitochondrial
outer membrane permeabilization is tightly controlled by
the interaction of anti- and pro- apoptotic proteins of Bcl2 family [44]. The ratio between anti- and pro-apoptotic
Bcl-2 family proteins has been recognized as an effective
marker to judge whether a cell will go to apoptosis [45].
Our investigation showed that treatment of cells with RY2f resulted in increase of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax
and Bad, but led to decrease of the anti-apoptotic protein
Bcl-2 (Figure 3C). Knockdown of Bax by specific siRNA
significantly suppressed the RY-2f-induced apoptosis
(Figure 3E). Therefore, our findings indicate that the
apoptosis induced by RY-2f is dependent on activation of
the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.
Cisplatin is one of the first-line chemotherapeutic
agents widely used to treat various cancers. However,
resistance to cisplatin has been a major clinical obstacle in
ovarian cancer therapy [46, 47]. Our data suggest that RY2f sensitizes both cisplatin sensitive and resistant ovarian
cancer cell lines A2780 and A2780/CDDP to cisplatin
treatment (Figure 4 A-C). Moreover, we also show that
RY-2f is able to overcome the resistance of cisplatin in
xenograft tumor models (Figure 6D and E).
The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, serving as a protooncogenic pathway, has been critical for cancer progression,
including cellular proliferation, growth, survival, and drug
resistance [48]. Over-activation of the signaling pathway
has been observed in a variety of tumors including ovarian
cancer, multiple myeloma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and
so on [49, 50]. Once a cell signal is received from external
growth factors, the corresponding receptors, such as the
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), can be dimerized
to trigger the AKT signaling cascade through PI3K, which
subsequently activates transcription factors like mTOR
and NF-κB to stimulate the transcription of pro-survival
genes [51]. Meanwhile, mTORC2 may be activated

DISCUSSION
Naturally occurring products and their synthetic
analogs have always been important sources for
discovering new therapeutic agents [36, 37]. In the
present study, as a part of our efforts to develop novel
chemotherapeutic agents, the isoflavone analog RY-2f
was identified with strong inhibition of ovarian cancer cell
proliferation. Importantly, in agreement with the in vitro
data, RY-2f also displays the activity to suppress in vivo
A2780 xenograft tumor growth with little toxicity in tested
animals at the therapeutic dose (Figure 6A-C).
Dysregulation of cell cycle is one of the major
characteristics in many cancers. Naturally derived
isoflavone compounds have exhibited their anti-tumor
activities through induction of cell cycle arrest in different
human cancer cell types [29]. The cyclin A/CDK2

by insulin-stimulated PI3K. Once activated, mTORC2
phosphorylates Ser473 of AKT to activate AKT [52]. In
addition, studies have also revealed that the activation of
AKT can suppress the pro-apoptotic factor Bad to inhibit
apoptosis and counteract the function of p21 to promote cell
cycle progression [53–55]. In this study, western blot and
immunohistochemistry analysis show that the phosphorylation
of AKT at Ser473 were attenuated by RY-2f in vitro
(Figure 5A) and in vivo (Figure 6G). In addition, introduction
of cells with constitutively active AKT1 significantly rescued
the inhibitory effect of RY-2f (Figure 5C), clearly indicating
that the anti-cancer effect is dependent on suppression of the
PI3K/AKT /mTOR pathway. Besides, we also found that RY2f dramatically induced the expression of PTEN (Figure 5A),
an important tumor suppressor and negative regulator of the
PI3K/AKT pathway, but didn’t affected the expression of
PI3K and AKT. Collectively, it might be proposed that the
primary target of RY-2f is AKT, and RY-2f may directly
interact with AKT to inhibit its phosphorylation. However,
further investigation is needed to validate this hypothesis
through protein kinase assay.
In summary, by in vitro and in vivo experiments, we
have revealed the potential therapeutic function of RY-2f, a
synthetic isoflavone analog, using human ovarian cancer cells
as a model. RY-2f induces cellular apoptosis and cell cycle
arrest, overcomes cisplatin resistance, and inhibits xenograft
tumor growth mainly through repression of the PI3K/ATK
pathway. Therefore, RY-2f may be developed as a potential
drug to treat human ovarian cancer after further validation.

plasmid was constructed as previously reported [57].

In vitro cytotoxicity
The in vitro cytotoxicity of RY-2f, glycitein and
genistein was measured by MTT (Sigma-Aldrich) assay,
as described in the literature [58]. Briefly, 5 × 103 cells
per well were plated in 96-well plates and treated with
RY-2f, glycitein, genistein or DMSO (diluent) at various
concentrations for 48 h. For synergistic effect assay, cells
were treated with RY-2f, cisplatin, RY-2f plus cisplatin
or DMSO (diluent) for 48 h. Then, the medium with
compounds or DMSO was replaced with 180 μL of fresh
medium along with 20 μL of MTT solution (MTT dissolved
in PBS at 5 mg/mL) in each well and incubated at 37°C
for 4 h. Last, the MTT-containing medium was discarded
and 150 μL of DMSO per well was added to dissolve the
newly formed formazan crystals. Absorbance of each well
was determined by a microplate reader (Synergy H4, BioTek) at a 590 nm wavelength. Growth inhibition rates were
calculated with the following equation,

Cell cycle analysis

RY-2f (Figure 1A) and its leading compound
glycitein, were chemically synthesized in our lab and
determined by spectra including 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR,
and high resolution mass spectrum (HRMS). The
Z-configuration of RY-2f was confirmed by NOESR 1D
spectra. The purity of RY-2f and glycitein was analyzed
over 98% by HPLC. Genistein and cisplatin were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO).

Cell cycle status was detected by flow cytometry
according to a previously published method [59] and
analyzed by Multicycle AV (for windows, version 320)
software. Briefly, cells were first treated with RY-2f
or DMSO at various concentrations for 48 h, and then
harvested, washed twice with 1× PBS, and re-suspended
in 200 μL of 1× PBS. The cells were fixed in 4 mL of
ice-cold 75% ethanol at 4°C overnight and stained with
200 μL of propidium iodide (50 μg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich)
and 20 μL of RNase (1 mg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich) to remove
RNA in a 37°C water bath for 15 to 20 minutes. The cells
were then analyzed by flow cytometry (Cytomics FC 500
MPL, Beckman Coulter). The results were indicated as
mean values from three independent determinations.

Cell culture and transfection
Human ovarian cancer cell lines A2780, HEY and
OVCA433 were purchased from ATCC. The cisplatin
resistant ovarian cancer cell line A2780/CDDP was kindly
provided by Prof. Ling-Ya, Pan [56]. Cells were routinely
cultured with RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS,
100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin in a
humidified incubator at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5%
CO2. RPMI-1640 medium and fetal bovine serum (FBS)
were purchased from Thermo Scientific. For transfection
studies, cells were transiently transfected with myrAKT1plasmid (constitutive active mutant) or the control

ratio

Cell apoptosis analysis
To detect apoptosis, cells were incubated with RY2f or DMSO at different concentrations for 24 h. The cells
were harvested, washed twice with cold 1 × PBS, and resuspended in 200 μL binding buffer at density of 1 × 105

cells / mL. The cells were then stained with 5 μL Annexin-V
and PI (BD Biosciences) for 15 min in dark condition at
room temperature and subjected to analysis by flow
cytometry (Cytomics FC 500 MPL, Beckman Coulter). The
early apoptosis was evaluated based on the percentage of
cells with Annexin V+/PI-, while the late apoptosis was that
of cells with Annexin V+/PI+. The results were indicated as
mean values from three independent determinations.

Mice were subcutaneously inoculated with A2780 or
A2780/CDDP cells (2 × 106 suspended in 0.2 mL PBS
for each mouse). After reaching an average tumor volume
of 100 mm3, the animals were randomized into groups
(n = 6) that were treated intraperitoneally with either
30 mg/kg RY-2f (compound dissolved in 0.2 mL olive
oil), CDDP (10 mg/kg) or vehicle control (0.2 mL olive
oil) thereafter. Administration of vehicle or agents and
measurement of tumor growth with a digital caliper were
done once every 4 days. Tumor volumes were calculated by
the two dimensional sizes of each tumor with the following
formula: V = L × W2 × 0.52, where V is the volume, L is
the length, and W is the width. At the end of experiment,
the mice were weighed and sacrificed, and the tumors were
weighed and dissected. The animal experimental protocols
were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Fudan
University Shanghai Cancer Center.

Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed to determine
the expression levels of various proteins in cells.
Cells were treated with RY-2f or DMSO at different
concentrations for 24 h. Cells were harvested, washed
with cold 1 × PBS, and lysed with RIPA lysis buffer
(Beyotime) for 30 min on ice, then centrifuged at
12,000 g for 15 min at 4°C. The total protein concentration
was determined by BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime).
Equal amounts (30 μg per load) of protein samples were
subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and transferred
on to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes
(Millipore). The blots were blocked in 10% non-fat
milk, and incubated with primary antibodies, followed
by incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated
with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The protein bands
were developed with the chemiluminescent reagents
(Millipore). Antibodies to p21, Bcl-2, Bad, Bax, cyclin
A, cyclin B1, CDK2, pAKT(Ser437), AKT, PI3K (p110
α), mTOR, PTEN were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
The Antibody to cleaved-PARP-1 was purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology. The antibody to β-Actin was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Statistical analysis
The data were calculated using Graph Pad Prism
and expressed as mean ± S.E. The values of IC50 were
fitted using a nonlinear regression model with a sigmoidal
dose response. Comparisons between controls and treated
groups were determined by paired t test or one-way
ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison tests.
Results were considered statistically significant at the
level of p < 0.05. Combination index was calculated by
CompuSyn software discovered by Chou T.C. et al.

Small interfering RNA (SiRNA) mediated
knockdown of Bax expression
Bax siRNA or Control siRNA were purchase
from Genepharma (Shanghai, China) and transfected
into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The sense and antisense
strands of siRNA were beginning at nucleotide 217,
5′ P-UAUGGAGCUGCAGAGGAUGdTdT-3′ (sense) and
5′ P-CAUCCUCUGCAGCUCCAUAdTdT-3′ (antisense)
[60]; P represents 5′ phosphate. Total cell lysates were
prepared 48 h after transfection to assess the knockdown
efficiency by western blot analysis. Otherwise, 24 h after
transfection, cells were treated with or without tivantinib for
additional 24 h and the cellular apoptosis was evaluated by
flow cytometry.
