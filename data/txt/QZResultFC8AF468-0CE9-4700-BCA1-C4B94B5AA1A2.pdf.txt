Chemokines are chemoattractant cytokines that regulate the trafficking and activation of leukocytes and other cell types under a variety of inflammatory and
noninflammatory conditions. Over the past few years, studies have increasingly
shown that chemokines play an important role in several aspects of tumor progression. Tumor cells express functional chemokine receptors, which can sustain

proliferation, angiogenesis, and survival and promote organ-specific localization
of distant metastases. Chemokine expression in human malignancies is associated with a leukocyte infiltration favoring the establishment of immune escape
mechanisms. A literature review of relevant publications on preclinical testing of
cancer therapies based on interference with the cancer chemokine network was
performed. The feasibility, potential advantages, and limitations of the clinical
translation of the results of such studies in treatment of different tumor types
and settings are discussed. The chemokine network is a key player in the establishment of metastases. In the preclinical setting, blocking agents and antibodies
directed against CXCR4 prevent metastasis of different cancers. In mouse models,
overexpression of selected chemokines causes tumor infiltration by distinct leukocyte subsets, resulting in tumor regression and tumor-specific immunity generation. Researchers have also successfully used chemokines as carriers and/or
adjuvants for cancer vaccines. The cancer chemokine network is a multifaceted
therapeutic target. Cancer 2007;109:2392–404.  2007 American Cancer Society.

hemokines are a family of chemoattractant cytokines whose
main function is to regulate cell trafficking. To date, studies
have identified more than 50 human chemokines and 20 chemokine
receptors.1,2 Chemokines can be classified into 4 subfamilies based
on the number and location of the cysteine residues at the N-terminus of the molecule.1 Chemokines are also grouped into 2 main
functional subfamilies: inflammatory and homeostatic chemokines.
Inflammatory chemokines control the recruitment of leukocytes in
inflammation and tissue injury, whereas homeostatic chemokines
fulfill housekeeping functions such as navigating leukocytes to and
within secondary lymphoid organs as well as in bone marrow and
the thymus during hematopoiesis.1,2 Chemokines bind to specific
cell surface transmembrane receptors coupled with heterotrimeric G
proteins, whose activation leads to formation of intracellular signaling cascades that prompt migration toward the chemokine source.
Directed migration of cells expressing the appropriate chemokine
receptors occurs along a chemical ligand gradient known as the
chemokine gradient, allowing cells to move toward high local
concentrations of chemokines.

Ligand-receptor association in mice but not in humans.

Chemokines first emerged as key regulators of
leukocyte migration, ensuring the localization of cells
to either lymphoid or peripheral tissues depending
on their activation state and the inflammatory status
of the tissue.1 Appropriate expression of chemokines
and their receptors facilitates dendritic cell (DC),
B-cell, and T-cell interactions, thereby promoting
the development of effective adaptive immune
responses.3 Peripheral activation of the innate
immune system induces secretion of inflammatory
chemokines that attract immature DCs. Upon activation and uptake of antigens, DCs down-regulate
receptors for inflammatory chemokines and upregulate receptors for homeostatic chemokines (eg,
CCR7)1,2 (Table 1). This coordinated switch in chemokine receptor expression allows mature, antigenloaded DCs to enter regional lymph nodes (LNs),
where they activate antigen-specific naive T and B
cells.1–3 Naive T cells express CCR7 and CXCR4, the
ligands for which (Table 1) are expressed in lymphoid
organs and navigate T cells through lymphoid tissue,
increasing their chances of encountering DCs carrying the specific antigen. Activated T cells then downregulate expression of CCR7 and increase expression
of other chemokine receptors, the ligands for which
are typically expressed in peripheral organs, particularly in inflamed tissues.1–4
However, researchers have found that hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells express receptors
for various chemokines that are constitutively
expressed in distinct tissue microenvironments. The
interactions between such receptors and their respective chemokines coordinate the trafficking and
organization of cells within different tissues. The
chemokine-receptor expression profile in an indivi-

dual cell is dependent on intrinsic characteristics
(eg, lineage, stage of differentiation) and microenvironmental factors, such as chemokine concentration,
the presence of inflammatory cytokines, and hypoxia.
Recently, investigators demonstrated that tumor
cells also constitutively express chemokines that are
inducible in normal tissues as well as functional
chemokine receptors.5 Compelling evidence has
revealed the multifunctional role of the chemokine
network in cancer, including acting as a growth or
survival factor, regulating angiogenesis, determining
metastatic spread, and controlling leukocyte infiltration into tumors to hinder antitumor immune
responses.5
Because of the many critical functions of the
chemokine network in cancer progression, manipulation of this network is a potential therapeutic option
for cancer. This review focuses on 2 possible chemokine network-related therapeutic interventions: strategies aimed at interfering with chemokine signaling
between tumor cells, their microenvironments, and
endothelium, leading to the establishment and
progression of metastases,6 and approaches for inducing antitumor immune responses.

Chemokines and Cancer Metastases
Recent data suggest that chemokine receptors in
cancer cells have a key regulatory role in directing
lymphatic and hematogenous spread and influencing
the sites of metastatic growth of different tumors.5
Although reports claim that several chemokine
receptors are involved in the establishment of metastasis from different tumors, the tissue analysis and
animal model data reported thus far for the majority

of these receptors are limited. On the other hand,
convincing and reproducible evidence of such a role
for the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR7 in
different tumors is available. CXCR4 is by far the
most common chemokine receptor overexpressed in
human cancer cells. Apart from leukocytes, in which
CXCR4 is ubiquitously present (Table 1), expression
of CXCR4 is low or absent in many normal tissues,
including breast,6 ovary,7 and colon.8 CXCR4’s sole
ligand, CXCL12, is constitutively expressed in many
tissues, including common sites of metastasis (eg,
lung, liver, bone).
In the preclinical setting, CXCR4 activation by
CXCL12 induces migration and/or survival of brain,9
colorectal,10 prostate,11 renal,12 and ovarian tumor
cells,13 along with melanoma14 and neuroblastoma.15
Elevated CXCR4 expression in primitive tumors is
associated with LN metastasis in breast,16–20 head
and neck,21 colon,22 and esophageal carcinoma.23
Moreover, CXCR4 expression is associated with intraperitoneal and intrapleural spread of ovarian cancer7
and nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC),24–26 respectively. Researchers found that the majority of metastases from melanoma in their study expressed
CXCR4.27 In glioblastoma cells, CXCR4 expression is
up-regulated compared with that in normal brain
tissue, and tumor cells secrete CXCL12.9 Strong
expression of CXR4 has been associated with adverse
outcome in osteosarcoma,28 epithelial ovarian
cancer,29 NSCLC,24 colon,22,30 and esophageal carci-

noma,23 nasopharyngeal carcinoma,31 and melanoma32 (Table 2).
Invasive breast cancer has exhibited higher
CXCR4 expression when compared with normal
breast tissue and ductal carcinoma in situ. However,
different patterns of CXCR4 expression in breast
cancer cells may have different prognostic value.33
Cytoplasmic CXCR4 expression is associated with
LN-positive tumors, estrogen receptor-negative and
HER-2-positive disease, and decreased overall survival
rates.18 Conversely, nuclear CXCR4 expression is
significantly associated with LN negativity and
decreased nuclear grades.16 A recently reported correlation between nuclear and cytoplasmic staining
for CXCR4 and histological breast cancer type appears
to be particularly relevant.33 Authors reported similar
findings in patients with early-stage NSCLC, in
whom strong CXCR4 nuclear staining was associated
with improved outcome.24
Neoplastic epithelial cells coexist with several
distinct stromal cell types that together create the
tumor microenvironment. Extensive clinical evidence
and experimental models support the contribution of
the stromal microenvironment to the development,
invasiveness, and metastasis of a variety of tumors.
Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts but not normal
mammary fibroblasts have high levels of CXCL12
expression.34,35 Expression of CXCL12 in turn promotes the progression of breast cancer by directly
enhancing tumor-cell growth and recruiting endothe-

Chemokine-Based Cancer Therapies/Ruffini et al.

lial progenitor cells, which are required for tumor
angiogenesis. Thus, a high level of expression of
CXCL12 in carcinoma-associated fibroblasts apparently can promote breast cancer progression in both
a paracrine and endocrine fashion.34
A low oxygen concentration induces a high level
of expression of CXCR4 in different cell types,
including cancer cells and endothelial cells, which is
paralleled by an increase in chemotactic responsiveness to CXCL12.36 Induction of CXCR4 expression by
hypoxia depends on both activation of hypoxiainducible factor (HIF)-1 and transcript stabilization.
Moreover, HIF-1 induces CXCL12 expression in
ischemic areas in proportion to reduced oxygen tension. Under normal oxygen tension, the von HippelLindau tumor suppressor gene induces degradation
of HIF-1. Loss of function of the von Hippel-Lindau
tumor suppressor gene and/or hypoxic conditions
result in constitutive activation of the HIF-1 pathway,37 leading to inappropriate accumulation of
HIF-1 and, as a result, increased expression of
CXCR4. An analysis of clear cell renal carcinoma and
hemangioblastoma that displayed mutation of the
von Hippel-Lindau gene in most cases showed
increased expression of both CXCR4 and its ligand
through both an autocrine and paracrine signaling
pathway.38
Functional CXCR4 is also expressed in nonhematopoietic tissue-committed stem/progenitor cells and
breast cancer stem/progenitor cells.39 Researchers
have documented the clonogenicity and tumorigenicity of breast cancer stem cells characterized by a
CD441CD24/low phenotype in NOD/SCID mice.40
CD24, a heavily glycosylated cell-surface protein,
negatively affects CXCR4 membrane lipid-raft residence and optimal signaling. CXCR4 appears to be
present in membrane rafts in CD24/low cells,
whereas it has been found to be absent in CD241/1
cells preventing triggering downstream signaling in
response to CXCL12 interaction.41
Researchers have investigated another chemokine receptor, CCR7, for its potential role in directing
metastasis to regional draining LNs, mimicking its
physiological role in mature DCs and naive T cells
(Table 1). The CCR7 ligands CCL19 and CCL21 are
constitutively expressed in lymphoid tissue. Breast
cancer cells have shown chemotaxis and chemoinvasion toward CCL21 gradients,6 suggesting that CCR7/
CCL21 interactions play a role in breast cancer
metastasis to LNs. Intravenous injection of CCR7transfected B16 melanoma cells in mice increased
the incidence of metastasis to LNs but not to lung;
LN metastases could be blocked by administration of
an anti-CCL21 monoclonal antibody.42 Finally, studies

2395

have positively correlated CCR7 expression in different types of cancer,16,25,43–46 with nodal metastasis
and poor prognosis (Table 2).

Chemokines and Intracellular Signaling
Pathway Interactions
In addition to direct stimulation of tumor-cell survival, proliferation, and spread, chemokines are implicated in cross-talk, with signaling pathways specific
to neoplastic cells. Members of the epidermal growth
factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) family (HER-1 and
HER-2) can activate different signaling modules leading to tumor proliferation, metastasis, and chemoand radioresistance.47 It has been observed that overexpression of HER-2 increased the expression of
CXCR4, which in turn was required for HER-2mediated invasion in vitro and lung metastasis in
vivo. Studies identified 2 distinct mechanisms of
CXR4 overexpression: enhancement of CXCR4 protein
synthesis and inhibition of its ligand-induced degradation.48,49 Conversely, inhibition of HER-2 expression using treatment with trastuzumab or small
interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in a corresponding
reduction in CXCR4 expression.
The nuclear factor (NF)-jB family of transcription factors has a fundamental role in cancer development, progression, and treatment resistance.50
Studies have indirectly linked NF-jB with tumor
metastasis because of its ability to regulate expression of matrix metalloproteinases, interleukin (IL)-8,
vascular endothelial growth factor, and CXCR4.51
Studies have also demonstrated that HER-2 can activate the NF-jB pathway52 and that NF-jB activation
results in enhanced CXCR4 expression.53 Furthermore, several reports have shown that ligandindependent transactivation of EGFRs and their
downstream signaling pathways is critical for the
mitogenic activity of G protein-coupled receptor
superfamily members such as CXCR4.54 Researchers
have reported transactivation of HER-2 and HER-1 in
breast and ovarian cancer cell lines, respectively,
after CXCL12/CXCR4 interaction through cytoplasmic
tyrosine kinase (c-Src) activation.48,54
In patients with NSCLC, activation of HER-1 by
EGF increases expression of CXCR4 and the migratory capacity of lung cancer cells.26 When NSCLC
cells are cultured with EGF under hypoxic conditions, CXCR4 expression is dramatically enhanced.26
Thus, a combination of low oxygen tension and
EGFR overexpression in primary NSCLC cells may
provide the microenvironmental signals necessary to
up-regulate CXCR4/CXCL12 expression and promote
metastasis. Conversely, inhibitors of downstream

2396

CANCER

targets activated by EGFR (eg, phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin) may
block both activation of HIF-1 and increases in the
expression of CXCR4 and prevent chemotaxis of
NSCLC cells in response to CXCL12.55 Moreover,
intratumoral hypoxia can activate NF-jB, further
enhancing CXCR4 expression. Overall, these observations clearly indicate the complexity of the cancer
‘chemokine-chemokine receptor’ network and the
sophisticated fine tuning of the CXCL12/CXCR4
axis at both the ligand and receptor level and are
likely to help identify or redefine new therapeutic
target pathways.

Immunosuppressive Networks in the Tumor
Microenvironment: The Role of Chemokines
Convincing evidence indicates that a developing
tumor interacts with the host immune system and
finally escapes immune destruction.56 This interaction includes hijacking the chemokine network to
evade immune recognition. The presence of DCs
within human tumors as a consequence of active
recruitment by tumor-derived chemokines is well
documented.57 Studies suggest that the tumor microenvironment may imbalance their action toward
immune paralysis.57,58 Furthermore, human tumors
(eg, ovarian cancer) are often infiltrated by macrophages recruited by tumor-secreted chemokines (eg,
CCL2)59 (Table 1). Tumor-associated macrophages
are also believed to have primarily protumor biological functions in vivo through the production of
several factors that promote tumor angiogenesis and
hinder immune reactivity.60 Finally, researchers
showed that tumor-derived chemokines can recruit
immunosuppressive T-regulatory (Treg) cells.58 Ovarian cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages
were shown to secrete CCL22, which recruited CCR4positive Treg cells to ovarian tumors and malignant
ascites61 (Table 1). Administration of a blocking antiCCL22 monoclonal antibody reduced Treg-cell
migration to tumors, providing compelling evidence
that CCL22 is a major chemoattractant for Treg cells
in ovarian cancer.61 Importantly, the presence of tumor-infiltrating Treg cells correlated with defective
antitumor immune responses and poor patient prognosis.61 At present, the relevance of the CCL22/
CCR461 and/or CXCL12/CXCR462 pathways in recruitment of Treg cells to other tumor microenvironments
is unclear. Overall, blocking the pathways described
above63 (eg, by antibodies to relevant chemokine
receptors) may be a strategy for boosting tumorspecific immune responses.

Experimental Evidence for Cancer Chemokine
Network-Directed Therapies
The largest body of evidence supporting a role for
chemokine and chemokine receptor involvement in
metastasis from different tumors centers on the
CXCR4/CXCL12 axis. Therefore, researchers thus far
have focused therapeutic strategies on this receptorligand pair. Molecules already in use with different
indications and new specific targeted therapies have
shown potential in this respect.

Heparin and Bisphosphonates:
New Roles for Old Players
Heparin
In experimental systems, interference with coagulation can affect tumor biology. A brief course of
subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin may
prolong survival, at least in certain subgroups of patients with advanced malignancies without venous
thromboembolism.64 Chemokines promote specific
leukocyte extravasation at sites of inflammation after
binding to the heparan sulfate (HSGAG) component
of proteoglycans. CXCL12 can be competitively
displaced by soluble heparins (including tinzaparin,
dalteparin, and nonanticoagulant low molecular
weight heparin) in preclinical models in a dosedependent manner. Researchers have observed complete chemotaxis inhibition of CXCR4-expressing
cancer cells induced by heparin.65 Moreover, structural dimerization is essential for in vivo activity of
chemokines. Heparin can shift the CXCL12 monomer-dimer equilibrium, promoting the monomeric
state.66 These observations add a novel rationale for
heparin use in the adjuvant setting.
Bisphosphonates
Osteoclast activation appears to be an important
mechanism of bone destruction and bone morbidity
from both osteolytic and osteoblastic metastases.
Preclinical data suggest that nitrogen-containing
bisphosphonates not only block osteoclast-mediated
bone resorption but also reduce invasion, proliferation, and survival of metastatic tumor cells in
bone.67,68 In breast and prostate cancer cell lines,
zoledronic acid inhibits the chemotactic effect induced by CXCL12, mainly through decreased expression of CXCR4 and reduced cell motility.67 Similarly,
researchers showed that minodronate (YM529) decreases CXCR4 expression in both osteoblastic and
osteolytic prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo,
suggesting that its ability to inhibit prostate cancer
bone metastases is a result, at least in part, of inhibition of the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis.69

CXCR4/CXCL12-Targeted Therapies
In experimental systems, selective inhibition of
CXCR4 suppresses CXCL12-induced migration of
cancer cells, invasion, neoangiogenesis and metastases6,9,70–77 (Table 3). In immunodeficient mice, studies showed that lung metastases from human breast
cancer could be inhibited by a neutralizing antibody
against CXCR472 or that their growth could be
delayed by inhibiting CXCR4 with an siRNA73 or specific CXCR4 antagonists.70 Similarly, neutralization of
CXCR4 significantly impairs the invasive capacity of
glioblastoma cells.9
Researchers originally developed small molecular
CXCR4 antagonists such as AMD3100, T140, and
ALX40-4C for treatment of human immunodeficiency
virus infection, as CXCR4 functions as a co-receptor
for the virus.78 AMD3100 is a bicyclam noncompetitive CXCR4 antagonist that fell short of expectations
as an antiviral therapeutic but showed an acceptable
toxicity profile.79 Comparative studies of T140,
AMD3100, and ALX40-4C found that each of them
inhibits CXCR4 via different mechanisms.80 Both
AMD3100 and ALX40-4C displayed weak partial agonistic activity on CXCR4 (CXCL12-like).81 Accordingly,
administration of AMD3100 results in mobilization of
hematopoietic stem cells, mimicking the physiological effect of CXCL12 and thus carrying the risk of
hematologic toxic effects if administered in combination with chemotherapy.79 In comparison, T140 has
pure antagonistic activity (ie, it cannot induce any
residual survival/prometastatic signals upon binding
to CXCR4) and suppresses hematopoietic stem cell
mobilization in mice.80 Overall, the T140 profile best
fulfills the requirement for an anticancer compound.
Finally, CTCE-9908 is a new analog of CXCL12 that

acts as a competitive inhibitor of CXCR4. Studies
showed that it decreased CXCL12 binding to CXCR4
by 50% as determined using radioligand assay, and
researchers have successfully tested it in different
preclinical models of prostate cancer and osteosarcoma.82,83 CTCE-9908 has proven to be safe in
healthy adults, and investigators recently initiated a
phase Ib/II clinical trial of CTCE-9908 for NSCLC
and other solid tumors.

Chemokines for Use in Immunotherapy
of Cancer
Given the chemoattractive1,2,57 effects of chemokines
on different leukocyte populations (Table 1), researchers have used intratumoral delivery of chemokines to recruit selected leukocyte populations to
tumors as initiators or effectors of antitumor immune
responses. Based on the dynamics of an adaptive
immune response, one would expect chemoattraction of immature DCs to tumors to initiate a tumorspecific immune response in a physiological manner
(Fig. 1A). This strategy would also circumvent the
need for preparation of DCs from each patient and
expose the whole antigenic repertoire of individual
tumors to the immune system. Indeed, injection of
CCL2084 and CCL1685 (Table 1) into different subcutaneously established tumors markedly inhibited
their growth and prolonged survival, eliciting tumorspecific T-cell immunity. Importantly, intratumoral
delivery of CCL16 before excision of a primary tumor
prevented metastatic spread and cured 63% of mice
as compared with 0% with surgery alone (Table 4).85
Authors have reported substantial antitumor effects
of intratumoral administration of chemokines active
on other leukocyte subsets, such as CCL19,86

FIGURE 1. Intratumoral administration of chemokines recruits dendritic cells (DCs) and/or effector cells. (A) Local administration of selected inflammatory
chemokines (eg, CCL20 or CCL16) (light blue spheres) (i) induces intratumoral recruitment of immature DC (iDC) bearing the relevant chemokine receptor (ii)
that are expected to pick up tumor antigens (red boxes) (iii), mature (mDC) (iv), and migrate to regional draining lymph nodes (LN), where they present antigenic
peptides to T cells to prime an adaptive immune response (v). (B) Local administration of selected chemokines (eg, CCL19, CCL21, CXCL10, and XCL1) (gray
spheres) (i) results in intratumoral accumulation of effector cells (T cells and/or natural killer cells) (ii) that kill tumor cells (iii); establishment of immunologic
memory depends upon uptake by DCs of tumor antigens released from killed tumor cells.

CCL21,87,88 and CXCL1089,90 on mature DCs and
XCL1 on effector cells (Table 1).91,92 In these studies,
therapeutic efficacy may have depended on the
recruitment of Th1, CD8, and natural killer (NK) antitumor effectors (Fig. 1B), whereas the role of DCs after chemokine-mediated recruitment was not clear
(Table 4). However, CCL21 differs in receptor specificity in mice and humans, possibly leading to overestimation of antitumor activity in mouse models (Table
1).87 Overall, although researchers reported tumor
regression, chemokines used as single agents showed
limited efficacy in curing established tumors.85 Efficacy
depended largely on the antigenicity of the tumors.84
Thus, investigators have devised different strategies to
increase the therapeutic potential of chemokines
against tumors. One strategy is modification of the tu-

mor microenvironment to elicit an innate immune
response. For example, intratumoral administration of
CpG (stretches of bacterial DNA that stimulate innate
immunity) coupled with systemic administration of an
anti-IL-10 (an immunosuppressive cytokine) monoclonal antibody potentiated the therapeutic efficacy of
intratumoral delivery of CCL1693 by switching the function of infiltrating macrophages and DCs from immunosuppression to immunopromotion (Table 4). However,
the range of immune cells responding to CpG differs in
mice and humans, raising the question of whether activation of innate immunity can be reproduced to the
same extent in patients.
In several studies, coadministration of immunostimulatory cytokines (IL-2 and IL-12) resulted in
augmented antitumor effects when compared with

As described herein, we reviewed the body of evidence strongly suggesting that the ‘chemokinechemokine receptor’ network plays several key roles
in tumor survival, proliferation, metastasis, and immune escape, making it an attractive therapeutic
target. Inhibition of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis has
demonstrated significant antineoplastic activity in
animal models (Table 4). Because most preclinical
studies have failed to demonstrate that CXCR4 inhibition can eliminate established metastases, CXCR4blocking strategies might be effective, particularly
for early-stage cancer. The involvement of chemokines in signaling pathways already targeted by mo-

administration of the individual chemokines XCL192,94
and CXCL1089,90 or cytokines alone (Table 4). In the
report by Narvaiza et al.,89 mice given the combination
of chemokines and cytokines also exhibited regression
of distant, noninjected tumors, confirming the role of
immune effector cells in tumor elimination. Interestingly, injection of CXCL10 and IL-12 into separate
tumors in the same animal abrogated much of the
antitumor response, demonstrating the importance of
colocalization of chemokines with cytokines. This
synergistic activity is likely a result of recruitment of T
cells to the tumor through CXCL10 expression and
their local expansion and activation induced by IL-2
or IL-12, which researchers have referred to as the
‘‘attraction-expansion paradigm.’’ It also offers solutions for reducing potentially dose-limiting toxic
effects of systemic cytokine administration.89 Finally,
intratumoral administration of chemokines may direct
adoptively transferred tumor-specific T cells bearing
the relevant chemokine receptor toward tumors.95
Alternatively, T cells can be engineered with receptors
for chemokines expressed in tumors.96
In the case of tumors expressing molecularly
identified tumor antigens, researchers have successfully used chemokines as vaccine carriers to elicit
tumor-specific immunity. Genetic fusion of a model
nonimmunogenic tumor antigen with inflammatory
chemokines generated antigen-specific, humoral,
and cellular protective antitumor immunity in 2
different syngeneic mouse models.97 Generation of
immunity depended on chemokine-mediated antigen
delivery to chemokine receptors on DCs to induce
receptor-mediated uptake and subsequent processing
and presentation of the antigen to both CD4198 and
CD8199 T lymphocytes (Fig. 2A). Investigators have
also used chemokines as vaccine adjuvants given
their capacity to recruit DCs leading to amplification
of antigen presentation (Fig. 2B).100

(i) targets antigen delivery to dendritic cells (DCs) via chemokine receptor (ii) for subsequent internalization (iii), processing and presentation to both CD41 and
CD81 T lymphocytes in draining lymph nodes (LNs) (iv). The chemokine moiety in the fusion vaccine may also result in the accumulation of DCs in the area of
vaccine administration. (B) Skin DCs are first recruited (i) by local chemokine (gray spheres) administration (1) and subsequently (2) loaded in situ with
tumor antigens (red boxes) (ii) and induced to migrate with hapten (hatched triangles) (iii) to regional draining LN (iv). iDC indicates immature dendritic cells;
mDC, mature dendritic cells.

lecular therapies (eg, trastuzumab/HER-2, cetuximab/
HER-1) may suggest an association of chemokine
interference strategy in order to improve treatment
efficacy.
Several reports have highlighted the potential of
chemokines in cancer immunotherapy. Intratumoral
administration of chemokines relies on the assumption that human tumors express tumor-rejection antigens and that specific T cells amenable to activation
exist in the host repertoire.56 A general caveat
concerning animal models relates to the use of
subcutaneously established tumors, even though the
skin is not the most common site of primary or
metastatic human cancer. The skin has a complex
network of immune cells100 absent in other sites
(eg, liver, bone), so it is conceivable to tailor chemokine-based immunotherapy to the target tissue. A

second general caveat is that murine tumors, unlike
human tumors, often bear retroviral antigens that
may be responsible for enhanced immune response.93
Cutaneous melanoma is a tempting target for intratumoral immunotherapy given its accessibility, antigenicity, and lack of effective treatment of recurrent
disease. The availability of topical immune adjuvants
(eg, imiquimod) used to activate tumor-infiltrating
DCs further increases the appeal of such a strategy.
Intratumoral chemokine administration to jump-start
an immune response before excision of a primary tumor85 is also applicable to patients with common
visceral cancers, who undergo invasive diagnostic
procedures (eg, colonoscopy) before surgery. Finally,
protumor, rather than antitumor, effects after intratumoral expression of the same chemokine (eg,
CCL20), have been reported.84,101

Chemokine-Based Cancer Therapies/Ruffini et al.

Advances in genomic sequencing will likely
expand the number of tumor antigens suitable for
patient vaccination. Chemokines have been extensively tested as carriers for induction of specific
immunity against the idiotype of syngeneic murine
B-cell tumors, in which the results compared favorably with those reported for other vaccine formulations.102 In a clinical perspective, the use of
chemokines as vaccine carriers raises the concern
that autoimmunity against chemokines may also be
elicited,103 with unknown consequences. However,
replacing native chemokines with viral chemokines
in vaccines would reduce this risk, given the only
partial sequence homology between human and viral
chemokines.104 With regard to the use of chemokines
as adjuvants, little is known of the effects of chemokine administration to humans.105
In conclusion, inhibition of tumor-cell survival
and metastatic spread and manipulation of antitumor immune response by interfering with the chemokine-chemokine receptor network have been
successful in animal models. Although this does not
necessarily predict a positive outcome of clinical
trials, testing of these strategies in selected patient
populations is warranted.
