ABSTRACT
Basal-like breast cancer is an aggressive tumor subtype with a poor response to
conventional therapies. Tumor formation and relapse are sustained by a cell subset of
Breast Cancer Stem Cells (BrCSCs). Here we show that miR-100 inhibits maintenance
and expansion of BrCSCs in basal-like cancer through Polo-like kinase1 (Plk1) downregulation. Moreover, miR-100 favors BrCSC differentiation, converting a basal like
phenotype into luminal. It induces the expression of a functional estrogen receptor
(ER) and renders basal-like BrCSCs responsive to hormonal therapy. The key role
played by miR-100 in breast cancer free-survival is confirmed by the analysis of a
cohort of patients’ tumors, which shows that low expression of miR-100 is a negative
prognostic factor and is associated with gene signatures of high grade undifferentiated
tumors. Our findings indicate a new possible therapeutic strategy, which could make
aggressive breast cancers responsive to standard treatments.

INTRODUCTION

tumor development, progression and recurrence [2]. The
presence of a CSC pool is associated with aggressiveness
and a negative prognosis in breast cancer patients. CSCs
are thought to possess intrinsic resistance to current
conventional therapies as compared to the bulk tumor cell
population and it has been proposed that tumor recurrence
is driven by this subpopulation of CSCs [3-5].
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs
that regulate gene expression at a post-transcriptional
level, thus monitoring several biological processes. Their
deregulated expression contributes to cancer development
and progression and can influence both the response to
therapy [6] and the development of drug resistance [7, 8].

The onset and progression of malignant tumors
depend on a small pool of tumor cells with biological
properties similar to those of normal adult stem cells. In
accordance to this cancer stem cell hypothesis, tumors are
organized in a hierarchical manner and are characterized
by cells that exhibit the ability to self-renew as well as to
give rise to differentiated cells. The CSCs represent the
apex of this hierarchy and appear to be the phenotypic
and functional equivalents of normal stem cells harboring
oncogenic mutations [1]. CSCs have been isolated in most
human solid tumor types, suggesting their central role in

Recently, miRNAs have also emerged as critical players
in the maintenance of pluripotency, control of self-renewal
and cell fate [9]. Restricted miRNA patterns are expressed
only in Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs) [10, 11] and specific
miRNAs regulate and are regulated by key stem cell genes
[12, 13]. The importance of the miRNA pathway in the
biology of stem cells has been confirmed in Dicer-1 knockout mice, where the loss of Dicer-1 results in the depletion
of the stem cell population in embryos [14]. Moreover,
Dicer-1 deficient murine ESCs fail to differentiate [15].
The majority of miRNAs that are important in ESC
biology are also involved in oncogenesis. This fuels the
hypothesis that miRNAs could be determinant in cell
stemness both in normal and in cancer stem cells [16, 17].
In line with this hypothesis, recent data provide evidence
that miRNAs might connect stemness and metastasis.
Indeed, some miRNAs specifically expressed in ESCs
can be inopportunely expressed in cancer cells, promoting
epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) [18, 19] and
metastasis [20].
The miR-100 family of microRNAs is composed
of three members, miR-100, miR-99a and miR-99b.
Comparative studies indicate that miR-100 is the oldest
known animal microRNA [21] and is widely expressed
in vertebrates [22]. Recent data demonstrated that miR100 is under-expressed in human ESCs compared
to differentiated cells [23] and is required for proper
differentiation of mouse ESCs [24]. The role of miR-100
in cancer is quite contradictory, since it can behave either
as an oncogene or as a tumor suppressor gene, depending
on the tumor type [25-27].
The present work shows that miR-100 plays a
pivotal role in regulating the transition between stemness
and differentiation of Breast Cancer Stem Cells (BrCSCs).
The ectopic expression of miR-100 in CSCs isolated from
breast cancer specimens impaired their self-renewal and
tumor-initiating ability. Notably, miR-100 induced luminal
differentiation in basal-like BrCSCs and rendered them
sensitive to endocrine therapies, such as tamoxifen and
fulvestrant.

cell line MCF7 was transiently transfected in the absence
of serum, either with a miR-100 specific antagomir or
a control antagomir. MiR-100 antagomir transfected
cells acquired a mammosphere-like phenotype. These
mammospheres retained the ability to differentiate when
cultured in the presence of serum, acquiring an adherent
shape (Fig. 1A). In order to ensure that antagomir-induced
mammospheres showed stem cell characteristics, we
analyzed the expression of the stem cell transcription
factors Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2. As shown in Fig. 1B, miR100 depleted cells expressed higher levels of the three
transcription factors, compared to cells transfected with
the control antagomir and to mammospheres obtained
from MCF7 cells cultured in standard stem cell conditions.
A wider gene expression analysis revealed that miR100 knockdown led to a global gene reprogramming
that could be responsible for the acquisition of the
stem-like phenotype (Fig. 1C). Also employed was a
complementary approach, evaluating miR-100 expression
in mammospheres generated from breast cancer cell lines
cultured in standard stem cell conditions. Consistently, the
expression of the miRNA was lower in mammospheres
than in the original adherent cells (Supplementary Fig. 1A,
B).

Analysis of miR-100 expression in Breast Cancer
Stem Cells
The level of miR-100 expression might be critical
in maintaining stemness and in determining the transition
from a stem to a differentiated status in cancer cells.
When miR-100 expression was analyzed in a panel of
CSCs isolated from basal-like and luminal breast cancer
specimens (Supplementary Table 1), lower average levels
of miR-100 were found in the CSCs derived from basallike tumors (Fig. 2A). BrCSCs derived from patient 5 (P5),
classified as basal-like subtype and expressing the lowest
level of miR-100, were selected for further experiments.
These cells displayed low levels also of the other two
members of the miR-100 family, namely miR-99a and
miR-99b (Supplementary Fig. 2A). The expression of the
miRNAs in P5 BrCSCs was evaluated upon growth in
conditions which favored differentiation. As shown in Fig.
2B and Supplementary Fig. 2B, the level of the miRNAs
promptly increased upon differentiation.

Here, attention was focused on human breast cancer,
where the biological role of miR-100 in tumor onset and
progression remains elusive. The aim was to modulate
miR-100 expression in vitro in breast cancer cells and

In order to investigate whether miR-100 could

the self-renewing ability of tumor-derived P5 BrCSCs

(data not shown) was undertaken. BrCSCs infected

used as a control. Exogenous expression of miR-100
severely impaired the clonogenic activity of BrCSCs in
in vitro limiting dilution assay (Fig. 3A) and in the soft
agar assay (Fig. 3B). Similar results were observed in the
subpopulation of BrCSCs obtained by sorting the bulk
population for the expression of the breast cancer stem
cell markers CD49f and CD24 [28, 29] (Supplementary
Fig. 3A, B). The effect of miR-100 on BrCSC proliferation
was evaluated via a cell cycle analysis. These data showed
a reduced G2 phase and an enlarged sub-G1 population in
miRNA transduced BrCSCs as compared to corresponding
controls (Fig. 3C). Consistently, an increased apoptotic
rate was revealed by an enhanced caspase3/7 activity
(Supplementary Fig. 3C). Labeling of BrCSCs with the
lipophilic fluorescent dye PKH-26 was used to further
investigate the effect of miR-100 on self-renewal. PKH26 is retained by quiescent stem cells whereas it is
gradually lost by proliferating progenitor cells [30]. MiR100 expression reduced the percentage of PKH-26high

cells (Fig. 3D, E), leading to the depletion of the BrCSC
proliferating pool.
CSCs are defined as those cells able to originate the
tumor and recapitulate the heterogeneity of the original
tumor mass when implanted in immunocompromised
mice. This inherent tumor-initiating capacity of CSCs is
believed to be responsible for tumor relapse in patients.
To address whether miR-100 could affect tumorigenic
potential, miR-100 or scramble transduced BrCSCs
were allowed to orthotopically grow in the mouse
mammary gland of NOD/SCID mice. Interestingly,
ectopic expression of miR-100 completely suppressed
tumor growth (Fig. 4A). Histological examination of
the fat pads showed that only a few breast cancer cells
expressing the proliferation marker Ki67 and the stem
cell marker Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) were
present in the residual tumor xenografts (Fig. 4B). Similar
results (Supplementary Fig. 4) were obtained in an
additional patient-derived basal-like BrCSC model (P8,

balance between stemness and differentiation (Fig. 4D
and Supplementary Fig. 5). On the contrary, BMP4,
which promotes terminal differentiation of CSCs [32],
was upregulated (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. 5).
To evaluate if the Wnt pathway is epistatic to miR-100
in controlling breast cancer stemness, we stimulated
scramble and miR-100 transduced BrCSCs and evaluated
the expression of the stem cell marker CD10. As shown
in Figure 4E, in control cells Wnt3a stimulation increased

the expression of CD10, whereas this effect was no longer
visible in cells expressing miR-100. Altogether, these
data infer that miR-100 expression interferes with CSC
maintenance, acting downstream to the Wnt pathway, and
triggers the activation of a differentiation program.

and differentiation [33, 34], was analyzed. MiR-100
transduced BrCSCs displayed a significant reduction
of Plk1 protein (Fig. 5A). Rescue experiments were
performed by re-introducing Plk1 in miR-100 expressing
BrCSCs and evaluating their self-renewing ability.
Upon Plk1 expression, colony forming efficiency was
partially recovered (Fig. 5B), while self-renewal was
restored at a level comparable to wild type BrCSCs (Fig.
5C). Consistently, the Plk1 inhibitor BI2536 impaired
viability both in the bulk population of BrCSCs and in
the CD49fhigh/CD24low sorted cells (Fig. 5D). These results

indicate that Plk1 plays a key role in mediating miR-100
induced phenotype.
SMARCA5 and SMARCD1, two miR-100 targets
belonging to the SWI/SNF protein family, have recently
been shown to participate in differentiation of embryonal
[24, 35] and cancer stem cells [36]. When we analyzed
their expression, we found that these two proteins were
significantly down-regulated in miR-100 transduced
BrCSCs compared to controls (Supplementary Fig. 6A,
B), suggesting that SMARC, together with Plk1, reduction
could contribute to miR-100 dependent differentiation.

MiR-100 promotes luminal differentiation
and renders basal-like BrCSCs responsive to
hormonal therapy

according to tertiles of miR-100 expression. At a median
follow-up of 60 months, low miR-100 expression was
associated with worse distant metastasis-free survival
in the whole population and in the subgroup with ERpositive tumors (Fig. 8A). To confirm the prognostic
value of miR-100, a univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis was
conducted on two validation sets of breast cancer patients
who underwent surgery and received adjuvant treatments
(GEO dataset superSeries GSE22220 and Supplementary
Table 3). MiR-100 expression could stratify patients
according to different prognosis (Supplementary Fig. 9)
in these case series, as well. Moreover, as highlighted
by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), miR-100
positively correlated with genes expressed in luminal
tumors. On the other hand, low levels of the miRNA were
associated with gene signatures of high-grade, poorly
differentiated cancers (Fig. 8B). This confirms that low
miR-100 expression is related to a more undifferentiated
phenotype.

To further validate the role of miR-100 in
controlling stemness and differentiation of breast
cancer cells, we evaluated either by flow cytometry or
immunofluorescence (IF) the expression of putative
stem/progenitor and differentiation markers upon ectopic
expression of the miRNA. FACS analysis showed that
stem cell markers, such as CD44, CD10 and CD49f, were
drastically reduced, while the differentiation markers
CD24 and EpCAM increased (Fig. 6). We also assessed
the expression of additional mammary stem/progenitor
markers by immunofluorescence analysis. Early
progenitor/stemness markers such as ALDH1, Cytokeratin
5 and myoepithelial Cytokeratin 14 were reduced in miR100 transduced BrCSCs; conversely, the luminal epithelial
markers Cytokeratin 8-18 and ER were de novo expressed
(Fig. 7A, B and Supplementary Fig. 7A, B). Expression
of ER upon miR-100 transduction was confirmed by
FACS analysis as well (Supplementary Fig. 8A). Using
the Aldefluor assay, we found that ALDH1 activity was
also greatly reduced (Fig. 7C and Supplementary Fig.
7C). Furthermore, the luminal differentiation promoted
by miR-100 was observed in CD49fhigh/CD24low sorted
BrCSCs as well (Supplementary Fig. 8B), confirming that
miR-100 not only interferes with stemness maintenance,
but also converts the breast cancer phenotype from basal
to luminal-like.
Then, we wondered whether the ER pathway was
functional in miR-100 expressing BrCSCs. Indeed, cells
transfected with an ERE luciferase reporter displayed
an increased luciferase activity in the presence of miR100 compared to control cells (Figure 7D). Finally, we
investigated whether miR-100 expression could sensitize
basal-like unresponsive BrCSCs to ER inhibitors.
Viability of miR-100 transduced P5 and P8 BrCSCs was
significantly affected by tamoxifen and fulvestrant, at
concentrations comparable to those used as optimal dose
regimen for the treatment of hormone receptor positive
breast cancers (Fig. 7E and Supplementary Fig. 7D).
These findings indicate that the differentiation program
activated by miR-100 is able to induce ER expression and
to sensitize basal-like BrCSCs to endocrine therapies.

DISCUSSION
Studies performed over the past years have
strengthened the hypothesis that breast tumors originate
from mammary stem cells, as a consequence of
dysregulation in the usually tightly controlled process of
self-renewal. Despite the fact that these CSCs represent
a small percentage of the tumor mass, growing evidence
points to them as being the cells responsible for the lifethreatening terminal evolution of the disease. They are
resistant to conventional therapies and can escape anticancer treatments, giving rise to relapse in patients [3,
4, 37]. Therefore, untangling the molecular mechanisms
underlying CSC maintenance becomes a priority for the
development of new cancer therapies able to eradicate the
disease.
It is known that miRNAs contribute in sustaining
stemness of embryonic stem cells, since ESC maintenance
is hampered by deficiency in the miRNA processing [14].
At the same time, miRNAs are essential regulators of
ESC differentiation, which is associated with changes
in the expression of specific miRNA patterns [38]. An
important role of miRNAs in controlling self-renewal and
differentiation of cancer stem cells has also recently been
described [15, 39, 40].
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease which
includes distinct types of tumors characterized by different
histological origins, molecular features and prognosis
[41]. Luminal tumors are characterized at the molecular
level by the expression of ER and PR receptors. ER and
PR signaling sustains tumor growth and thus, therapies
interfering with ER activation are currently the gold
standard for the treatment of this type of cancer. Basallike tumors are defined by their lack of ER, PR and HER2
expression in about 75% of cases. These cancers are
poorly differentiated and are loaded with CSCs, a feature

Low miR-100 expression predicts poor prognosis
in breast cancer patients
To understand the clinical relevance of miR-100 as
a possible prognostic factor, we examined its expression
in 123 breast tumor specimens. Patients underwent radical
local-regional therapy for resectable node-negative breast
cancer and received no further adjuvant treatments until
relapse (Supplementary Table 2). Patients were categorized

that is associated with a poor clinical outcome [28, 42].
The absence of the specific molecular targets in basal-like
breast cancers renders ineffective the targeted therapies
that significantly improve prognosis for hormone receptorpositive and HER2-overexpressing breast cancers.
Therefore, a possible therapeutic strategy to treat basallike tumors is to induce CSC differentiation and to allow
the expression of genes, such as ER, to be used as targets.
The strategy of using drugs that force malignant cells to
terminally differentiate has been known for the past thirty
years as “differentiation therapy” and is strictly connected
to the concept of tissue-selective therapy [43]. Such an

approach drastically reduces side effects in patients
since it avoids indiscriminately killing proliferating cells
and instead concentrates its efficacy on cancer cells in a
tissue specific manner, taking advantage of differentiation
molecules that are specifically expressed in the selected
tissue. This therapy has its successful paradigm in the
treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with alltrans retinoic acid [44]. However, despite the promising
results obtained in hematological malignancies, the
application of differentiation therapy in solid tumors
has been hampered due to inadequate knowledge of
the mechanisms governing cell differentiation. The

current findings uncover miR-100 as a key player in the
complex scenario of the differentiation process. They
show that miR-100 is critical in controlling stemness and
differentiation of patient-derived basal-like breast CSCs.
MiR-100 interferes with the CSC properties, impairing
self-renewal and blocking tumor-initiating ability.
Our results also suggest that miR-100 induces a prodifferentiative program which involves the Wnt/β-catenin
pathway. Activation of β-catenin and expression of Wnt
target genes are involved in the balance between stemness
and differentiation. Indeed, it was found that Wnt pathway
activation was reduced in cells expressing miR-100 and
Wnt3a treatment was unable to promote the expression of
stem cell markers. Moreover, the down-regulation of Plk1,
a serine/threonine kinase target of miR-100 that controls
cell cycle progression, was observed. Recently, Plk1 has
been implicated in the regulation of stem cell maintenance
and proliferation, as inhibiting Plk1 activity impaired
growth and induced apoptosis of neurospheres [34] and
of colon cancer initiating cells [33]. Here it was shown
that Plk1 is required to sustain expansion of BrCSCs, as
miR-100 mediated down-regulation of Plk1impairs CSC
properties and depletes the CSC pool.
Furthermore data from this research provide
evidence that the exogenous expression of this miRNA
not only hampers the replication potential of basal-like
BrCSCs, but also induces their differentiation toward
a luminal phenotype. In this way, miR-100 allows the
conversion of an aggressive molecular subtype of cancer
into a subtype with a better prognosis, for which effective
treatments are available. Indeed, miR-100 promoted
the expression of the estrogen receptor and rendered
basal-like cells responsive to 17-β-estradiol and to the
anti-proliferative activity of tamoxifen and fulvestrant.
Several miRNAs (such as miR-206, miR-221/222, miR22, miR-17/92 and miR-145) inhibit ER expression and
sustain resistance to hormonal therapies [45-47]. However,
miRNAs that are able to induce de novo expression of this
target molecule and responsiveness to endocrine treatment
in triple negative breast cancer cells have never been
previously described.
The results obtained in this pre-clinical system are
consistent with the analysis performed on breast tumor
specimens. High levels of miR-100 are associated with
luminal gene signatures, while undifferentiated high
grade tumors correlate with lower miRNA expression.
This is also in line with recent findings that demonstrate
the presence of a higher CSC content in G3 poorly
differentiated tumors [30]. This could explain the poor
outcome and the tendency to relapse [28]. Moreover, the
analysis of breast tumor specimens from two validation
data sets, which include patients who received adjuvant
therapy, revealed that low expression of miR-100
correlates with a negative prognosis in ER-positive
patients. This raises the question as to whether this miRNA
might be a predictor of hormonal therapy response. Further
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

studies on appropriate cohorts of patients are warranted to
address this hypothesis.
Overall, these findings have relevant clinical
implications, as they suggest the possibility of targeting
basal-like CSCs using a pro-differentiative therapy
approach, by promoting miR-100 expression. Moreover,
they propose miR-100 as a response predictor to endocrine
therapy and offer a therapeutic perspective in treating an
aggressive tumor type, for which there are no effective
therapeutic options available at this time.

METHODS
Tissue collection and cell culture
Fresh tissue acquired from mastectomies of 8
patients (age 40–89) were collected at the University
of Palermo and Fondazione IRCCS INT of Milan, in
accordance with ethical standards. Breast tumor cells
were purified from fresh tissue via enzymatic digestion
as previously described [48]. Thereafter, single cell
suspensions were plated in ultra-low attachment flasks
(Corning) at a density of 1×105/ml and grown in a medium
supplemented with bFGF (10 ng/ml, Sigma) and EGF
(20 ng/ml, Sigma). To induce differentiation, cells were
cultured in adherent conditions in Ham’s/F-12 medium
(Euroclone), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), insulin (25μg/ml, Sigma) and hydrocortisone (1mg/
ml, Sigma). MCF7 cells were purchased from ATCC and
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Sigma).

Cell transfection, lentiviral constructs and cell
transduction
MCF7 cells were transiently transfected with a miR100 specific antagomir (AM10188, Ambion) in serum free
medium using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). MiR-100
stable expression was obtained by transducing cells with
a lentivirus expressing miR-100 as previously described
[26]. The lentiviral short hairpin scramble (pLKO.1)
used as a control was purchased from Sigma. For the
in vivo imaging, gene transfer was performed using a
TWEEN lentiviral vector containing luciferase (LUC)
and green fluorescent protein (GFP) as reporter genes. For
β-catenin activity assay, BRCSCs were transduced with
lentiviral-TOP-dGFP-reporter (Addgene) that consists of
a LEF-1/TCF-responsive promoter upstream d2-eGFP.
Transfection of packaging cell line HEK-293T was
performed using FuGENE Reagent (Roche) and following
the manufacturer’s instructions. BRCSCs were dissociated
into single cells, then infected with 100 ng virus/105 cells.

Biological assays

(Sigma). Samples were analyzed by FACSCalibur and
CellQuest Software (BD Biosciences).

For the clonogenic assay, cells were plated on a
ultra-low adhesion 96-well plate at a concentration of
a single cell per well and observed for 21 days. Wells
containing either none or more than one cell were
excluded from the analysis. For soft agar assay, 0.4%
Seaplaque soft agar (Lonza) was diluted with stem cell
medium and was covered by a second 0.3% soft agar layer
in which BrCSCs were embedded. After 21 days, colonies
were stained with 0.005% crystal violet (Sigma) for 1 hour
at 37°C. For anti-estrogen treatment, cells were treated
with 2.5-10 μM tamoxifen (Selleckchem) and 0.5-2 μM
fulvestrant (Selleckchem) for 24-48 hours. Cell viability
was assessed by means of a cell Titer Aqueous Assay Kit
(Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Alternatively, cell death was evaluated by orange acridine/
ethidium bromide staining as previously described [48]
and using Cell Titer-Glo luminescent cell viability assay
kit (Promega). For the assessment of apoptosis, 3x103
cells/well were seeded in ultra-low adhesion 96-well
plate in stem cell medium and activation of caspases 3
and 7 was evaluated after 72hours using the CaspaseGlo 3/7 Assay (Promega). The proliferative rate of stem
cells was analyzed using the PKH-26 assay (2×10-6 M,
Sigma) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Samples
were analyzed by FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). For
β-catenin activity experiments, cells transduced with the
indicated lentiviral constructs were analyzed by FACS.
As a positive control, cells were treated with BIO (1uM,
Calbiochem) for 24 hours in order to inhibit GSK-3α/β.
For viability assay, single cells suspensions were treated
with the Plk1 inhibitor BI2536 (10nM, Selleckchem) for
72 hours.
In order to evaluate changes of CD10 expression
upon Wnt pathway modulation, scramble or miR-100
BrCSCs were treated either with Wnt3a (300ng /ml) every
6 hours for 24 hours or DKK1 (200ng/ml) for 24 hours
and then analyzed by flow cytometry.

Quantitative analysis of microRNA and gene
expression
Total RNA was extracted using TRI Reagent
solution (Ambion) following manufacturer’s instructions.
Analysis of miR-100, miR-99a and miR-99b was
performed starting from equal amounts of total RNA/
sample (10ng) using the specific Taqman microRNA
assay kits (Applied Biosystems). MiRNA expression was
calculated as fold change using the delta-delta CT method
and RNU48 as endogenous control.
Gene expression was evaluated by quantitative realtime PCR using the EXPRESS SYBR green (Invitrogen).
Retrotranscription was performed using the High Capacity
Retrotranscription Kit (Applied Biosystems) starting from
500ng of total RNA.
Expression profiling of pluripotency genes was
performed starting from 1.5ug of total RNA using
TaqMan Human Stem Cell Pluripotency Arrays (Applied
Biosystems), according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Gene expression was calculated as ∆CT (CT gene - CT
GAPDH). The differentially expressed genes were
statistically analyzed using t-test and genes with a P<0.05
were included in the heat-map. Expression was reported
as -∆CT normalized to the median. The heat-map was
obtained by Gedas software [49].
Expression of Wnt target genes was performed
through RT2 profiler PCR array (PAHS-243, Qiagen),
according to manufacturers’ instructions. Arrays were
performed independently for BrCSCs wt, scamble and
miR-100 and at least 3 technical replicates were run for
each sample. Cycle threshold values were normalized
using the average of 5 housekeeping genes on the same
array (B2M, HPRT1, RPL13A, GAPDH and actin B). The
comparative cycle threshold method was used to calculate
the relative quantification of gene expression.

FACS analysis and Cell sorting

Animal models

BrCSCs were exposed to primary antibodies CD44
(BU75, Ancell), CD24 (ML5, R&D System), CD10
(FR4D11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CD49f (GoH3
Miltenyi Biotec), EpCAM (AF960, R&D System) or
corresponding isotype controls, rinsed and labeled with
secondary antibodies. BrCSCs were stained with CD49f
and CD24 and successively sorted via flow cytometry
using an FACSAria cell sorter (BD Biosciences). The
analysis of ALDH1 activity was performed using the
ALDEFLUOR kit (StemCell Technologies). For cell cycle
analysis, BrCSCs were fixed in 70% ethanol and incubated
with 50 μg/mL propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich), 3.8
mmol/L sodium citrate (Sigma) and 10 μg/mL RNase

Orthotopic xenografts were obtained by injecting
105 BrCSCs P5 or P8 in the murine mammary gland of
three week-old female NOD/SCID mice. In vivo imaging
was performed by a Biospace instrument upon i.p.
injection of Luciferin (150 mg/kg, Promega).

manufacturer’s instructions (LSAB2, Dako). Stainings
were revealed using AEC (Dako) and counterstained with
aqueous hematoxylin.

those who developed distant metastasis within 5 years of
treatment (59 patients, disease free survival range: 8-58
months) and those who were disease-free for more than
60 months (64 patients, disease free survival range: 60185 months). The two subsets of patients were comparable
in age, tumor size, histotype, ER and HER2 status. Each
patient wrote an informed consent, which authorized
the use of material for research purposes. The study was
approved by the Independent Ethics Committee and the
Institutional Review Board.

Immunofluorescence
BrCSCs were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde
for 30 minutes at 37°C and incubated O.N. at 4°C with
the following primary antibodies: ALDH1 (44, BD),
CK5 (XM26, Novocastra), CK14 (LL002, Novocastra),
CK8-18 (CD10, Novocastra), MUC1 (BD Pharmigen),
VIMENTIN (R28, Cell Signaling), ER (6F11,
Novocastra). Thereafter, cells were labeled with secondary
antibodies (Invitrogen). Nuclei were counterstained with
Toto-3 (Invitrogen).

miRNA and gene expression analysis in breast
cancer patients
Global gene and miRNA expression data were
obtained using the HumanRef-6_v3 and Human miRNA_
V2 Illumina BeadChips, respectively. Raw data were
generated using the Illumina BeadStudio 3.8 software and
processed using the Bioconductor lumi package. After
quality control, the Robust Spline Normalization was
applied. For gene signature expression analysis, all genes
were correlated with miR-100 expression and gene sets
from the C2 collection of the MSigDB were tested for
their enrichment among positively or negatively correlated
genes using GSEA (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea).

Western blot
Cell pellets were lysed in buffer (TPER, Pierce; 300
mM NaCl; 1 mM orthovanadate; 200 mM PEFABLOC,
Roche; 5 µg/ml Aprotinin, 5 µg/ml Pepstatin A, 5 µg/ml
Leupeptin, Sigma). Lysates (30 µg/lane) were fractioned
with SDS-PAGE and blotted to PVDF. Membranes were
blocked with no-fat dry milk in TBS 0.05% Tween20 and
incubated overnight with a specific antibody for Plk1
(208G4, Cell Signaling), SMARCD1 (AB81621, Abcam),
SMARCA5 (MAB120, Millipore) and β-actin (JLA20,
Calbiochem). Densitometric analysis was performed by
UVP.

Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as average ± standard
deviation. Statistical significance was determined by the
t-test or by Analysis of Variance (one-way or two-way)
with Bonferroni post-test. P values <0.05 were considered
significant (* P<0.05; ** P<0.01; *** P<0.001).

ERE-reporter assay
Cells were transfected with 1μg mixture of an
inducible ERE-responsive firefly luciferase construct
(kindly provided by Dr. De Bortoli, University of
Torino) and a constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase
construct (40:1) (Cignal Reporter Assay, Qiagen) using
Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Life Technologies) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were seeded into
ultra-low attachment 24 wells plates (Corning) at a density
of 100,000 cells per well. After 48 hours from transfection,
cells were treated for 6 hours with either vehicle or 10 nM
17-β-Estradiol (E2758, Sigma) and the reporter activity
was measured by luminescence. Values were normalized
to Renilla luciferase activity; data are presented as relative
luciferase values.
