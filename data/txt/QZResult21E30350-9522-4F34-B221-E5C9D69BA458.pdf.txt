ABSTRACT
The MDM2-p53 pathway plays a prominent role in well-differentiated liposarcoma
(LPS) pathogenesis. Here, we explore the importance of MDM2 amplification and p53
mutation in LPS independently, to determine whether HDACi are therapeutically useful
in LPS. We demonstrated that simultaneous knockdown of MDM2 and p53 in p53mutant LPS lines resulted in increased apoptosis, anti-proliferative effects, and cell
cycle arrest, as compared to either intervention alone. HDACi treatment resulted in
the dephosphorylation and depletion of MDM2 and p53 without affecting CDK4 and
JUN expression, irrespective of p53 mutational status in MDM2-amplified LPS. In
control mesothelioma cell lines, HDACi treatment resulted in down-regulation of p53
in the p53 mutant cell line JMN1B, but resulted in no changes of MDM2 and p53 in two
mesothelioma lines with normal MDM2 and wild-type p53. HDACi treatment substantially
decreased LPS and mesothelioma proliferation and survival, and was associated with
upregulation of PTEN and p21, and inactivation of AKT. Our findings indicate that
wild-type p53 depletion by HDACi is MDM2 amplification-dependent. These findings
underscore the importance of targeting both MDM2 and p53 in LPS and other cancers
harboring p53 mutations. Moreover, the pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effect of
HDACi warrants further evaluation as a therapeutic strategy in MDM2-amplified LPS.

causing significant complications and high mortality [1, 5].
There are currently no systemic therapeutic regimens known
to improve survival in unresectable LPS, underscoring the
need for an improved molecular understanding to develop
effective targeted therapies.
Regions of chromosome 12q13–15, typically
involving MDM2, CDK4, and HMGA2, as well as other
genes, are often amplified in WDLPS and DDLPS [6–11].
Additionally, JUN maybe amplified in WDLPS cases with
a dedifferentiated component [12], and down-regulation
or complete loss of PTEN or an alternative mechanism of
PIK3CA mutation results in AKT activation in a subset of
LPS [2, 13, 14], implicating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
as a therapeutic target [15]. Dysregulation of the MDM2-p53
regulatory feedback loop is crucial in WDLPS pathogenesis,

INTRODUCTION
Liposarcoma (LPS) is the most common human
sarcoma, representing 24% of extremity and 45% of
retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma [1–3]. LPS is subdivided
into five histopathologic subtypes, including welldifferentiated (WDLPS, ∼50%), dedifferentiated (DDLPS,
9% to 18%), round cell, myxoid, and pleomorphic.
Dedifferentiated, round cell and pleomorphic LPS are highgrade, aggressive tumors with significant metastatic potential
while WDLPS and myxoid LPS are low-grade tumors that
follow a more indolent clinical course [1, 2, 4]. Although
complete surgical resection can be curative, WDLPS often
develops in difficult locations such as the retroperitoneum or
mediastinum, making complete surgical resection difficult,

whereas MDM2 and CDK4 were expressed abundantly
in LPS141 and LPS510, with 1768 and 123 MDM2, and
5644 and 1213 CDK4 transcript reads, respectively. TP53
transcript was low in LPS510, which contains a TP53
point mutation, and normal in TP53 wild-type LPS141
and MESO257. MDM2, TP53 and CDK4 transcript levels,
expressed as RPKM values, are shown in Figure 1A.
MDM2 protein expression was strong in LPS449,
LPS778, LPS853, and LPS141, medium in LPS141/239
and LPS141/266, and weak in LPS510 (Figure 1B). p53
protein expression was strong in p53 mutant LPS141/239
and LPS141/266 and weak in p53 wild-type LPS449 and
LPS510. By contrast, expression of MDM2 and p53 was
undetectable in GIST882. MDM2 expression in LPS141/239
and LSP141/266, and p53 expression in the liposarcoma lines
with wild-type p53 (LPS778, LPS853, and LPS141) were
comparable to that in MESO924 cells (Figure 1B).
The effect of Nutlin-3 treatment on cell proliferation
is shown in Figure 1C. Nutlin-3 dramatically inhibited cell
proliferation in p53 wild-type LPS778 and LPS141 in a
concentration-dependent manner. By contrast, Nutlin-3 had
only minor effects (5–15% reduction in proliferation) in p53
mutant LPS141/239, LPS141/266, and LPS510, indicating
that p53 mutation is a major Nutlin-3 resistant mechanism.

with most LPS harboring either MDM2 amplification or p53
mutation [6, 7, 16, 17] and individuals with germ-line p53
mutations are at an increased risk of WDLPS development at
an earlier age [18]. Inhibition of the MDM2-p53 interaction
by Nutlin-3, an antagonist of MDM2, induces apoptosis and
growth arrest in p53 wild-type LPS [19, 20].
Histone acetylation is an important determinant of
gene expression, and histone deacetylases (HDACs) play a
crucial role in cell development and cancer by deacetylating
histones and others proteins [21–23]. Numerous studies
have demonstrated aberrant expression of HDACs in human
cancers, and expression of various HDACs can serve as
molecular biomarker of tumors [23, 24]. Overexpression of
individual HDACs was able to predict poor patient prognosis
independent of tumor type and disease in several cancers
[25–28]. Aberrant HDAC activity is linked to key oncogenic
events of tumorigenesis [21, 22], and HDAC inhibitors
(HDACi) can induce tumor cell apoptosis, senescence,
differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and immunogenicity [23].
The HDACi vorinostat and romidepsin have received
FDA approval for use against refractory cutaneous T
cell lymphoma, and many other HDACi are in clinical
trials [23, 29, 30]. The results are promising, but HDACi
have pleiotropic effects, acting with various mechanisms
across different tumor types, and therefore are not wellunderstood [21]. However, Blagosklonny and colleagues
found that HDACi (FR901228 and trichostatin A) were
cytotoxic to cancer cells via depletion of mutant p53 [31],
and restored expression and function of pseudo-null p53
[32]. An additional study showed preferential cytotoxicity
of an HDACi, SAHA, in mutant p53 cancer cell lines by
destabilizing mutant p53 through inhibition of the HDAC6HSP90 chaperone axis [33]. Functional inactivation of MDM2
and CHIP (carboxy-terminus of HSP70-interacting Protein)
by HSP90 results in aberrant stabilization of mutant p53
[34]. Thus, we hypothesized that HDAC inhibition might be
therapeutically useful in p53-mutant, Nutlin-3-resistant LPS.
In this study, we evaluate the effects of the HDACi
SAHA and LBH589 on proliferation and survival of LPS
and control mesothelioma cell lines. We examine the effects
of HDACi on amplified MDM2, wild-type and mutant p53,
PTEN and AKT. We also demonstrate that dual targeting
of amplified MDM2 and mutant p53 shows additive antiproliferative effects, as compared to either intervention alone.
These studies suggest that HDACi warrant clinical evaluation
as a therapeutic strategy in LPS harboring mutant p53.

Biologic effects of HDAC inhibition in LPS and
mesothelioma cell lines
Degradation of MDM2 and mutant p53, and induction
of PTEN by HDACi
We evaluated the effects of HDACi on MDM2, p53,
PTEN, CDK4, and JUN by immunoblotting in LPS lines
by treating with HDACi (LBH589 and SAHA) for 48 hours
(Figure 2). LBH589 (100 nM) and SAHA (5 μM) depleted
MDM2 and p53, and induced PTEN and acetyl H3 in all LPS
lines (Figure 2). Treatment with LBH589 and SAHA had little
impact on CDK4 and JUN. HDAC inhibition induced acetyl
tubulin in LPS778 and LPS510, but showed little effect in
LPS141 and isogenic LPS141/239 and LPS141/266 (Figure 2).

HDAC regulation of LPS and mesothelioma
proliferation and survival
HDACi LBH589 and SAHA were evaluated by
immunoblotting, apoptosis, proliferation, and cell cycle
analyses (Figure 3A–3G). Treatment with HDACi
LBH589 and SAHA induced expression of p21, PTEN,
and acetyl-H3 in all LPS lines (Figure 3A), and inactivated
AKT in LPS510, LPS778, MESO924, and MESO296
(Figure 3B) in a concentration-dependent manner.
Treatment with HDACi resulted in degradation of mutant
p53, and induction of p21, PTEN, and acetyl-H3, but had
little effect on phosphorylation and expression of MDM2
in JMN1B. HDACi LBH589 and SAHA showed minimal
effect on expression/phosphorylation of MDM2 and p53
in MESO924 and MESO296 (Figure 3A).

cultures. Statistically significant differences between untreated control and treatments are presented as *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.

Cell proliferation was strongly inhibited in all LPS and
mesothelioma cell lines in a dose-dependent manner after
HDAC inhibition (Figure 3C): LBH589 and SAHA IC50
values in p53-mutant lines were 66 nM and 6.5 μM
(LPS141/239), 110 nM and 7.1 μM (LPS141/266), 34 nM
and 4.2 μM (LPS510), and 52 nM and 3.7 μM (JMN1B),
respectively, and in wild-type p53 lines were 59 nM and 5.8
μM (LPS141), 41 nM and 4.2 μM (LPS778), 520 nM and
3.8 μM (MESO924), and 540 nM and 4.7 μM (MESO296),
respectively. The anti-proliferative effect of LBH589 was
stronger in all LPS cell lines and p53 mutant JMN1B than in
p53 wild-type MESO924 and MESO296, whereas the antiproliferative effect was greater in MESO924 and MESO296
than JMN1B and all LPS cell lines after treatment with
SAHA (Figure 3C). HDAC inhibition also dramatically
suppressed the expression of cyclin A in all five LPS lines
and JMN1B, but moderately inhibited cyclin A expression
in MESO924 and MESO296 (Figure 3D).
Treatment with LBH and SAHA for 48 hours induced
apoptosis in all cell lines, as evidenced by increased
expression of caspase 3, increased caspase 3/7 activity
(Figure 3D and 3E), and PARP cleavage (Figure 3D),
in a dose-dependent manner. The apoptotic effects of
LBH589 were stronger in all LPS and JMN1B than those of
SAHA. Caspase 3/7 activity was more dramatic in LPS and
mesothelioma cell lines with MDM2 amplification and/or
p53 mutation than in cell lines with wild-type p53 (Figure
3E). LPS cell lines analyzed 48 hours after LBH589 and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

SAHA treatments showed a dramatic increase in apoptotic
cells compared to vehicle-treated cells, particularly in
lines harboring mutant p53 (Figure 3F and Supplementary
Table 1). Apoptosis was most prominent in LPS141 and
LPS510, with nuclear fragmentation increasing from 0%
(LPS141), 16% (LPS510), and 1% (LPS778) in cells treated
with DMSO, to 10% (LPS141), 22% (LPS510), and 7%
(LPS778) in cells treated with 250 nM LBH589 (Figure 3F
and Supplementary Table 1).
Cell-cycle analysis in LPS141, LPS141/266,
LPS141/239, and LPS778 showed a G2 block after HDAC
inhibition with an increase in the G2 peak from 27%, 28%,
33% and 20% in DMSO control cells to 41%, 65%, 64%,
and 27% after LBH589 treatment, respectively (Figure
3G and Supplementary Table 2). Treatment with 5 μM
SAHA resulted in G1 arrest in LPS778 (DMSO: 66%;
SAHA: 78%), and G2 arrest in LPS141 (DMSO: 27%;
SAHA: 43%), LPS141/239 (DMSO: 33%; SAHA: 41%),
and LPS510 (DMSO: 28%; SAHA: 31%) (Figure 3G and
Supplementary Table 2).

MESO924, at 10 days after transduction (Figure 4A).
MESO924 has normal MDM2 and wild-type p53.
We achieved greater than 60% knockdown of the
targets with at least one construct. MDM2 knockdown
increased p53 and p21 expression, irrespective of
p53 mutational status, in p53 wild-type LPS141 and
MESO924. p53 knockdown had little effect on MDM2
and p21 in LPS cell lines but decreased MDM2 and p21
expression in MESO924 (Figure 4A). MDM2 or p53
knockdown alone dramatically reduced LPS510 and
LPS141/239 cell growth. The combination of MDM2 or
p53 knockdown had an additive effect on cell growth,
compared to either intervention alone (Figure 4B).
MDM2 knockdown, in p53 wild-type LPS141, and p53mutant LPS141/239 and LPS510, resulted in ~40% and
~60–70% inhibition of cell viability, respectively, at
10 days after MDM2 silencing, compared to the empty
vector control. MDM2 knockdown resulted in a mild
reduction in viability for a p53 mutant LPS141/266
(Figure 4C). p53 knockdown with at least one construct
resulted in 20–70% reduction in viability of three
mutant p53 LPS cell lines (LPS141/266, LPS141/239,
and LPS510), but had little effect on viability of p53
wild-type LPS141. Combination of MDM2 and p53
knockdown resulted in 40–80% reduction in cell
viability and showed a greater effect on cell growth,
in three mutant p53 LPS cell lines (LPS141/266,
LPS141/239, and LPS510), compared to either
intervention alone (Figure 4B).

MDM2 knockdown resulted in a dramatic G1 block
in p53-wild-type LPS141, or G2 block in p53-mutant
LPS141/266 and LPS141/239. The G1 peak was 49%
(LPS141), and the G2 peaks were 22% (LPS141/266), 23%
(LPS141/239), and 6% (LPS510) in the empty vector-treated
cells compared to 69–73% (LPS141) in G1 populations,
and 23–29% (LPS141/266), and 26–31% (LPS141/239)
in G2 populations in MDM2 shRNA1/2-treated cells
(Figure 4D and Supplementary Table 3). Cell cycle analyses
also demonstrated a G2 block after p53 knockdown in
LPS141/266, LPS141/239, and LPS510 (Figure 4D).
The G2 peaks were 25–28% (LPS141/266), 34–35%
(LPS141/239), and 12–13% (LPS510) in cells with p53
knockdown (Figure 4D and Supplementary Table 3).
Combination of MDM2 and p53 knockdown resulted in
a G2 block for LPS141/239, LPS141/266, and LPS510
(Figure 4D). MDM2, p53, or both shRNA knockdown also
induced apoptosis in two mutant p53 liposarcoma cell
lines (LPS141/239 and LPS510): in LPS141/239, nuclear
fragmentation was demonstrated in 3% cells treated with
empty vector control, but in 11% cells treated with MDM2
shRNA1, in 5% cells treated with p53 shRNA1, and in
17% cells treated with combination of MDM2 shRNA1
and p53 shRNA1; in LPS510, nuclear fragmentation was
demonstrated in 19% cells treated with empty vector
control, but in 31% cells treated with MDM2 shRNA1,
in 18% cells treated with p53 shRNA1, and in 28% cells
treated with combination of MDM2 shRNA1 and p53
shRNA1 (Figure 4D and Supplementary Table 3).

Mutant p53 interacts with MDM2

[6, 7, 35]. Our findings confirm amplification of MDM2
and CDK4 in LPS cell lines, as compared to unamplified
mesothelioma cell lines (MESO257 or MESO924)
(Figure 1A and 1B, and SNP data (not shown)). The
crucial oncogenic role of MDM2-p53 has recently been
demonstrated by the inhibitory effect of Nutlin-3, an
antagonist of MDM2, on MDM2-amplified LPS cell lines
[19, 20]. In the present work, we confirm that Nutlin-3
inhibits cell viability in two LPS lines harboring wild-type
p53 (LPS778 and LPS141), but show an attenuated effect in
LPS lines harboring mutant p53 (LPS141/239, LPS141/266,
and LPS510) (Figure 1C). This result indicates that p53
mutation is a Nutlin-3 resistance mechanism in LPS.

The interaction between MDM2 and p53 was
evaluated in LPS cell lines by p53 immunoprecipitation
followed by MDM2 immunoblotting. A MDM2 80 kDa
band was observed in LPS cell lines irrespective of p53
mutation status (Supplementary Figure 1).

DISCUSSION
Almost all cases of WDLPS harbor MDM2
amplification or TP53 mutations [7, 9, 17]. Amplification
of MDM2 and CDK4 has been found in WD and DDLPS

Control of p53 expression by MDM2 is lost
in tumors harboring mutant p53, resulting in p53
hyperstabilization and accumulation [34]. We hypothesized
that HDAC inhibition might induce pro-apoptotic and antiproliferative effects in liposarcoma cell lines harboring p53
mutations. Recent studies have demonstrated functional
inactivation of MDM2 and CHIP E3 ligase activity by
HSP90 inhibition, resulting in aberrant stabilization
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of mutant p53 [34], and SAHA inhibited cell growth in
mutant p53 human cancer cells by destabilizing mutant p53
through inhibition of the HDAC6-HSP90 chaperone axis
[33]. HDACi showed a strong impact on cell viability and
apoptosis in LPS and mesothelioma cell lines containing
mutant or wild-type p53 (Figure 3C–3G). Treatment with
LBH589, in MDM2-amplified and/or p53-mutant cell lines
(LPS141, LPS141/239, LPS141/266, LPS510, LPS778,
10515

and JMN1B), had greater inhibitory effects on viability
than in normal MDM2 and p53-wild-type cell lines
MESO924 and MESO296, whereas the anti-proliferative
effects of HDAC inhibition by SAHA in p53-wild-type
mesothelioma cell lines were greater (MESO924 and
MESO296) than LPS cell lines (Figure 3C). These data
suggest that HDAC regulation of LPS cell viability can
be targeted effectively in MDM2-amplified and/or p53mutant cancer cells by LBH589, and that SAHA treatment
can show dramatic anti-proliferative effects in-p53 wild
type cancer cells.
We next investigated the effects of HDACi LBH589
and SAHA on the expression of MDM2 and p53 in these
cell lines (Figures 2 and 3A). Immunoblotting showed that
treatment with HDACi LBH589 and SAHA for 48 hours
induced the degradation of mutant p53 in three LPS cell lines
(LPS141/239, LPS141/266, and LPS510) and a mesothelioma
cell line (JMN1B) (Figures 2 and 3A). This finding is in
line with published data showing that SAHA treatment led
to degradation of mutant p53 [33]. Unexpectedly, HDAC
inhibition by SAHA and LBH589 resulted in downregulation of wild-type p53 in two LPS cell lines (LPS141
and LPS778), and a decrease in MDM2 and phospho-MDM2
in all LPS cell lines, irrespective of p53 status (Figures 2
and 3A). By contrast, expression and phosphorylation of
MDM2, in three normal MDM2 mesothelioma cell lines
(JMN1B, MESO924, and MESO296), and expression of p53,
in two p53 wild-type mesothelioma cell lines (MESO924
and MESO296), were unchanged or slightly affected after
treatment with HDACi (Figures 2 and 3A). Unexpectedly,
HDAC inhibition resulted in p53 (wild-type and mutant)
degradation in a dose-dependent manner in LPS cell lines,
whereas treatment with HDACi induced p21 expression, a
direct p53 downstream responder (Figure 3A), indicating that
regulation of p21 is p53-independent after HDAC inhibition.
These novel findings indicate that HDACi regulation of wildtype p53 and MDM2 is MDM2 amplification-dependent.
CDK4 and JUN are amplified in LPS [12]. Recent
studies have demonstrated that the selective cyclindependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4)/CDK6 inhibitor PD0332991
inhibits growth and induces senescence in LPS cell lines
and xenografts. Furthermore, treatment with the CDK4
inhibitor PD0332991 was associated with a favorable
progression-free survival in patients with CDK4-amplified
and RB-expressing WDLPS/DDLPS who had progressive
disease despite systemic therapy [36]. In addition, JUN
knockdown by shRNAs reduced cell viability in vitro and
inhibited tumor formation in vivo without an observable
effect on the differentiation state of the LPS cells [12].
Interestingly, in the present report, unlike the effects
of HDACi on MDM2 expression (Figure 2), neither
LBH589 nor SAHA affected expression of CDK4 or JUN,
indicating that the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic
effects of HDACi do not depend on CDK4 or JUN in LPS
cell lines (Figure 2). Therefore, these data indicate that
MDM2 amplification and/or p53 mutation play the crucial

oncogenic role in LPS and mesothelioma cell proliferation
and survival.
Previous studies have suggested that aberrant activation
of PI3-K/AKT/mTOR signaling due to down-regulation
or complete loss of PTEN or an alternative mechanism of
PIK3CA mutation, is a potential therapeutic target in LPS and
mesothelioma [2, 13, 14, 37, 38]. Although the mechanism is
unclear, we show here that HDACi LBH589 and SAHA induce
PTEN expression in all LPS and mesothelioma cell lines tested
(Figure 2 and Figure 3A) accompanied by AKT inhibition
(Figure 3B), consistent with published data that NBM-HD-3,
a potent HDAC inhibitor, increases PTEN expression [39].
These data suggest that the apoptotic and anti-proliferative
effects of HDACi are also associated with up-regulation of
PTEN and inactivation of AKT.
We previously reported that MDM2 inhibition
(Nutlin-3) induced p53 expression, cell apoptosis, antiproliferative effects and cell cycle arrest in mesothelioma
[40]. In the present work, treatment with HDACi LBH589
and SAHA induced apoptosis and reduced cell viability
in two p53 wild-type mesothelioma cell lines (MESO924
and MESO296) and one p53 mutant mesothelioma cell
line (JMN1B), associated with an up-regulation of PTEN
and p21, inactivation of AKT, and degradation of mutant
p53 (Figure 3A–3F). More recent studies also show that
SAHA-induced apoptosis is FLIP/caspase 8-dependent
and HR23B-independent in mesothelioma [41]. Our data
add to the already substantial evidence that targeting the
crucial HDACi pathway might be an effective strategy in
mesothelioma, especially in p53-mutant sublines.
HDAC inhibition resulted in downregulation of
amplified MDM2 and mutant p53, and significantly reduced
LPS cell viability (Figures 2, 3A–3G). On the basis of these
findings, we hypothesized that additive effects would be
obtained through attacking both amplified MDM2 and
mutant p53 together. Therefore, we further evaluated the
function of the amplified MDM2, mutant p53 alone, or
both together, by shRNA knockdown. MDM2 or p53 shRNA
knockdown in the MDM2-amplified and/or p53-mutant
LPS cell lines had profound anti-proliferative consequences
(Figure 4B–4D). By contrast, p53 silencing did not affect
proliferation in wild-type p53 LPS cell line LPS141
(Figure 4C and 4D). These findings suggest that MDM2
amplification or p53 mutation play essential oncogenic
roles in LPS. Notably, additive effects were obtained
through simultaneous MDM2 and p53 knockdowns, with
this combination approach inhibiting cell growth more than
either intervention alone (Figure 4B and 4C). In addition,
p53 mutations, including N239D (LPS141/239), H179R
(LPS510) or G266R (LPS141/266) did not affect the
interaction of MDM2 and p53 (Supplementary Figure 1), and
MDM2 knockdown resulted in accumulation of mutant p53,
indicating that MDM2 remains a major regulator of mutant
p53. Based on the evidence presented in this report, we
propose MDM2 amplification and p53 mutation as essential
proliferation mediators in LPS, and suggest that targeting

and libraries were constructed from the rRNA-depleted
RNA according to the SOLiD Total RNA-seq Kit Protocol
(Applied Biosystems). Briefly, RNAs were fragmented by
RNAse III to an average size of 150 bases, ligated to adaptors
in a directed orientation, and the resultant library served
as template for cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification.
Approximately 50 bases were sequenced from one end
of each fragment using either the SOLiD 3+ or SOLiD
4 instrument and reagents (Applied Biosystems). The
resulting sequence data were mapped to the human reference
genome, hg18, using Bioscope v1.2 (Applied Biosystems).
Sequences that mapped to unique locations were quantified
per transcriptional unit, as defined in RefSeq (release 35),
as “Reads Per Kilobase of transcript per Megabase of total
sequence (RPKM)”. In addition, a weighted score was
used to describe significant disparities between samples for
each transcript in a manner incorporating the magnitude of
expression as well as the difference.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Antibodies and reagents
Monoclonal antibodies to p53, cyclin A, and
polyclonal antibody to CDK4 were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibody
to acetyl-tubulin, and polyclonal antibodies to phosphoMDM2 (Ser166), PTEN, phospho-AKT (Ser473), AKT,
JUN, acetyl-histone H3, and cleaved caspase 3 were from
Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibodies to
PARP, MDM2, and p21 were from Invitrogen Laboratories
(Invitrogen life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Polybrene,
puromycin, and antibody to β-actin were from SigmaAldrich (St, Louis, MO). Lentiviral shRNA constructs were
from The RNAi Consortium (TRC, Cambridge, MA, USA),
and included MDM2: CTTTGGTAGTGGAATAGTGAA
(shRNA1); CTCAGCCATCAACTTCTAGTA (shRNA2),
and p53: CTTCGACTATCTCAAACTCCT (shRNA1),
CAAGGTACTTCGATGATGAAT (shRNA2). LBH589
(Panobinostat) and SAHA (vorinostat) were obtained
from LC Labs (Woburn, MA). These inhibitors were
reconstituted in DMSO.

Protein lysate preparations and immunoblotting
Immunoblotting was performed after 48 hours of
treatment with LBH589 or SAHA, and after 10 days postinfection with MDM2/p53 shRNAs. Whole cell lysates
were prepared using lysis buffer (1% NP-40, 50 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0, 100 mM sodium fluoride, 30 mM sodium
pyrophosphate, 2 mM sodium molybdate, 5 mM EDTA,
and 2 mM sodium orthovanadate) containing protease
inhibitors (10 μg/mL aprotinin, 10 μg/mL leupeptin, and
1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysate protein
concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein
assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories Hercules, CA, USA).
Electrophoresis and western blotting were performed as
described previously [46]. The hybridization signals were
detected by chemiluminescence (ImmobilonTM Western,
Millipore Corporation, MA) and captured using a GE FUJI
ImageQuant LAS4000 chemiluminescence imaging system.

Liposarcoma and mesothelioma cell lines
LPS141, LPS141/266, LPS141/239, and LPS510 were
developed in the Department of Pathology at Brigham and
Women’s Hospital. The LPS141 cell line was developed from
a DDLPS with heterologous osteosarcoma, arising in a patient
with a history of recurrent WDLPS [12]. LPS141/266 and
LPS141/239 are isogenic sublines of LPS141 which retain
the parental MDM2 and CDK4 genomic amplification but
have p53 point mutations (G266R and N239D, respectively).
LPS510 contains MDM2 and CDK4 genomic amplification,
and a p53 point mutation (H179R). T778 (LPS778) and
LPS449 were a gift from Dr. Florence Pedeutour, were
established from a patient with recurrent WDLPS, and are
p53 wild-type [42]. Mesothelioma cell lines established
in Dr. Jonathan Fletcher’s laboratory from epithelial-type
mesotheliomas (MESO924 and JMN1B) [43, 44] or mixed
histology mesothelioma (MESO296) [44, 45]. MESO924
and MESO296 have wild-type p53, but JMN1B contains a
p53 point mutation (G245S). All cell lines were validated by
unique clonal cytogenetic aberrations within 10 passages of
the present studies (MESO924 and MESO296 were validated
by comparison with the corresponding surgical specimens,
and JMN1B was validated by comparison with published
cytogenetic aberrations).

Immunoprecipitation
Sepharose-protein G beads linked to goat polyclonal
antibody were used. One mg of protein lysate (500 μL)
was preadsorbed for 30 min using 20 μl of protein G beads
at 4°C. 10 μl of primary antibodies against mouse p53
(0.2 μg/μL) were rocked with the lysates for 2 hours at
4°C. Then, 20 μL of sepharose-protein G beads was added
and rocked overnight at 4°C, then centrifuged at 10,000
rpm for 2 min at 4°C, after which the sepharose beads
were washed 3 times with 750 μL of IP buffer (25 min/
each time) and once with 750 μL 10 mM Tris-Cl buffer
(pH7.6). Loading buffer (20 μL) was added to the beads
and boiled for 5 min at 95°C.

pMD.G (at a 10:10:1 ratio) into 293T cells. Transfections
were carried out using lipofectamine and PLUS reagent
(Invitrogen life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Lentiviruses
were harvested at 24, 36, 48, and 60 hours posttransfection. Virus was frozen at −80°C in appropriately
sized aliquots for infection. Well-validated shRNAs were
used for MDM2 and p53 knockdowns.

dark. The stained cells were analyzed in a flow cytometer
(FACScan, BD Biosciences) within 1 hour and CellQuest
software (BD Biosciences) was used to analyze the data.

Cell cycle analysis
LPS141, LPS141/239, LPS141/266, LPS510, and
LPS778 cells in 6-well plates were treated with inhibitors
for 48 hours or MDM2 and p53 shRNAs for 10 days with
selection, then trypsinized and washed once with ice-cold
PBS. For nuclear staining, cells were fixed by 70% ethanol
for 24 hours. A PBS solution containing RNase (10 μg/ml)
and propidium iodide (PI) (Roche) was added to the cells
and incubated for 15 minutes at 37°C. The cell suspension
was analyzed on a flow cytometer (FACScan, BD
Biosciences) within 48 hours and ModFit LT (Macintosh)
was used to analyze the data.

Cell culture and virus infection
LPS cell lines (LPS141, LPS141/239, LPS141/266,
LPS449, LPS778, and LPS510) and mesothelioma
cell lines (MESO924, MESO296, and JMN1B) were
maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin and
1% (v/v) L-glutamine. LPS cells and MESO924 were
seeded in six-well plates and lentiviral shRNA infections
were carried out in the presence of 8 μg/mL polybrene.
All lentiviral experimental results were performed in
duplicate. Following transduction, LPS141, LPS141/239,
LPS141/266, LPS510, and MESO924 cells were selected
for stable expression of the MDM2 or p53 shRNAs using
2 μg/ml puromycin. Cell culture images were obtained
using SPOT software and a Nikon Eclipse TE2000–5
inverted microscope and cells were lysed for western
blotting or cell cycle analysis 10 days post-infection.

Statistical analysis
Student’s t-tests were performed on data from
cells treated with control DMSO or inhibitors, as well as
cells treated with empty vector, MDM2, or p53 shRNAs.
Statistically significant differences between untreated
control and treatment were defined as *P < 0.05, **P <
0.01 and ***P < 0.001.

Cell lines were plated at 3,000 cells/well in a 96well flat-bottomed plate (Falcon, Lincoln NJ) and cultured
for 24 hours before treatment with different inhibitors,
which included Nutlin-3 (2.5, 5, 10 and 20 μM), LBH589
(0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 1 μM), SAHA (0.5, 1, 2, 5 and
10 μM), MDM2 shRNAs or p53 shRNAs. Cell viability
was determined after treatment with inhibitors or shRNAs
for 3 or 8 days, respectively, using the CellTiter-Glo
luminescent assay (Promega, Madison, Wisc.) and
measured using a Veritas™ Microplate Luminometer
(Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA). The data were
normalized to the control group (empty vector or DMSO).
The IC50 value was defined as the concentration that
causes 50% growth inhibition. IC50 values were calculated
using a sigmoidal curve fit with GraphPad Prism Software
(GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). All
experimental points were set up in four replicate wells and
independently performed in duplicate.
Apoptosis was evaluated using the PE Annexin V
Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Pharmingen™, USA).
Briefly, LPS141, LPS141/239, LPS141/266, LPS510, and
