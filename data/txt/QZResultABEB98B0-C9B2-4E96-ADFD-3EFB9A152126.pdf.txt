Abstract
It has been reported that gefitinib, an epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has the
ability to modulate the function of certain ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) transporters and to reverse ABC subfamily B
member 1 (ABCB1; P-glycoprotein)– and ABC subfamily G
member 2 (ABCG2; breast cancer resistance protein/mitoxantrone resistance protein)–mediated multidrug resistance
(MDR) in cancer cells. However, it is unknown whether other
EGFR TKIs have effects similar to that of gefitinib. In the
present study, we have investigated the interaction of another
EGFR TKI, erlotinib, with selected ABC drug transporters.
Our findings show that erlotinib significantly potentiated
the sensitivity of established ABCB1 or ABCG2 substrates and
increased the accumulation of paclitaxel or mitoxantrone in
ABCB1- or ABCG2-overexpressing cells. Furthermore, erlotinib did not significantly alter the sensitivity of non-ABCB1 or
non-ABCG2 substrates in all cells and was unable to reverse
MRP1-mediated MDR and had no effect on the parental cells.
However, erlotinib remarkably inhibited the transport of
E217BG and methotrexate by ABCG2. In addition, the results
of ATPase assays show that erlotinib stimulated the ATPase
activity of both ABCB1 and ABCG2. Interestingly, erlotinib
slightly inhibited the photolabeling of ABCB1 with [125I]
iodoarylazidoprazosin (IAAP) at high concentration, but it
did not inhibit the photolabeling of ABCG2 with IAAP. Overall,
we conclude that erlotinib reverses ABCB1- and ABCG2mediated MDR in cancer cells through direct inhibition of the
drug efflux function of ABCB1 and ABCG2. These findings may
be useful for cancer combinational therapy with erlotinib in
the clinic. [Cancer Res 2007;67(22):11012–20]

Introduction
The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a superfamily
of transmembrane proteins that transport a wide variety of
substrates across extracellular and intracellular membranes,
ranging from ions, sugars, amino acids, vitamins, lipids, and drugs

to larger molecules such as oligosaccharides, oligopeptides, and
even high molecular weight proteins (1). In the human genome,
48 different ABC transporters have been identified and divided
into seven subfamilies (A–G) based on sequence similarities (2).
The ABC transporters play a crucial role in the development of
multidrug resistance (MDR). This occurs by pumping out drugs
from the cells, and this process is coupled to the energy of ATP
hydrolysis on the ATPase domain of ABC transporters that is
stimulated in the presence of transport substrates (3). Thus far,
the major members of the ABC transporters leading to MDR in
cancer cells include ABC subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1; also
called P-glycoprotein), MDR proteins (MRP; C subfamily of ABC
transporters) and ABC subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2; breast cancer resistance protein/mitoxantrone resistance protein/placentaspecific ABC transporter; ref. 2). These proteins are highly varied
transporters. They share the ability to recognize and transport a
large number of structurally diverse, mainly hydrophobic, compounds from cells. However, each transporter can translocate
unique compounds, in addition to their overlapping substrate
specificity (2). Drugs transported by ABCB1 involve large
hydrophobic, either uncharged or slightly positively charged,
compounds, including most chemotherapeutic agents such as
Vinca alkaloids, anthracyclines, epipodophyllotoxins, and taxanes
(4). A few of MRPs subfamily members have been proved to confer
MDR to organic anion compounds and phase II metabolic products
including natural product chemotherapeutic agents, antifolates,
and nucleotide analogues (5). The spectrum of chemotherapeutic
agents transported by ABCG2 includes anthracyclines, mitoxantrone, camptothecin-derived and indolocarbazole topoisomerase I
inhibitors, methotrexate, and flavopiridol (6).
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the ErbB/HER family of receptor
tyrosine kinases, which homodimerize or heterodimerize on ligand
activation, resulting in transphosphorylation of tyrosine residues in
the cytoplasmic domain of tyrosine kinase receptors (7). In human
tumors, the EGFR is often overexpressed, dysregulated, or mutated,
and these abnormal alterations of EGFR activate a series of
intracellular protein kinase signaling pathways such as the Ras/
mitogenactivated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase,
signal transducer and activator of transcription, protein kinase C,
and phospholipase D pathways, promoting tumor growth and
progression including the promotion of proliferation, angiogenesis,
invasion, and metastasis and inhibition of apoptosis (7, 8).
Therefore, blockade of EGFR activation may be able to suppress
cancer cell growth and progression. Presently, two predominant

Reversal of ABCB1- and ABCG2-Mediated MDR by Erlotinib

classes of anti-EGFR targeting agents have been developed and
used in the clinic. These include small-molecule tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKI) that compete with ATP to bind to the intracellular
receptor catalytic domain of EGFR, such as the 4-anilinoquinazoline derivatives gefitinib (Iressa, ZD1839) and erlotinib (Tarceva,
OSI-774), and monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab (Erbitux,
C225) that block the ligand binding to the extracellular domain of
EGFR and prevent receptor activation (9, 10).
Theoretically, TKIs usually are hydrophobic and need to enter
the cell to reach their targets, allowing the ABC transporters to
interact with them and modulate their effectiveness. The HER
family TKI CI1033 (PD 183805), a 4-anilinoquinazoline derivative,
enhances the cytotoxicity of topotecan and SN-38 through
inhibition of ABCG2-mediated drug efflux in cancer cells (11).
Gefitinib has been observed to directly inhibit the function of
ABCB1 in multidrug resistant cancer cells (12) and to reverse
ABCG2-mediated MDR in vitro (13–15). In vivo studies indicate
that gefitinib modulates the function of ABCB1 and ABCG2, leading
to increased oral absorption and reduced topotecan clearance (16),
and enhances the antitumor activity and oral bioavailability of
irinotecan in mice (17). It also increases the penetration of
topotecan into brain extracellular fluid but decreases its ventricular
cerebrospinal fluid penetration in a mouse model (18). Furthermore, gefitinib has a higher affinity for ABCG2 than ABCB1 or
ABCC1 (19). However, there is no up-to-date report that elucidates
the interaction in details between ABC transporters and erlotinib,
which possesses a similar chemical structure to gefitinib. Therefore,
we have examined the interaction between erlotinib and ABCB1,
ABCC1, and ABCG2 in this study.

Materials and Methods
Materials. [3H]Paclitaxel (37.9 Ci/mmol), [3H]mitoxantrone (4 Ci/mmol),
and [3H]methotrexate (23 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Moravek
Biochemicals, Inc. [3H]E217hG (40.5 Ci/mmol) and [125I]iodoarylazidoprazosin (IAAP; 2,200 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Perkin-Elmer Life
Sciences. Monoclonal antibodies C219 (against ABCB1) and BXP-34 (against
ABCG2) were acquired from Signet Laboratories, Inc. BXP-21 was obtained
from Kamiya Biomedicals. Anti-actin monoclonal antibody was obtained
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Erlotinib was kindly produced by OSI
Pharmaceuticals. Fumitremorgin C was synthesized by Thomas McCloud
Developmental Therapeutics Program, Natural Products Extraction Laboratory, National Cancer Institute, NIH. Other chemicals were purchased
from Sigma Chemical Co.
Cell lines and cell culture. The ABCB1/P-glycoprotein–overexpressing
drug-resistant cell line KB-C2 was established by step-by-step increases in
the concentration of colchicine to parental human epidermoid carcinoma
cell line KB-3-1 and was cultured in medium with 2 Ag/mL colchicine (20).
An ABCC1-overexpressing MDR cell line, KB-CV60, was also cloned from
KB-3-1 cells and was maintained in medium with 1 Ag/mL cepharanthine
and 60 ng/mL vincristine (21). Both KB-C2 and KB-CV60 cells were kindly
provided by Dr. Shin-ichi Akiyama. The wild-type ABCG2 [arginine (R)
at 482 position]–overexpressing drug-resistant cell line MCF-7/Flv1000
was established by gradually increasing the concentration of flavopiridol
to the parental drug-sensitive human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and
was cultured in medium with 1,000 nmol/L flavopiridol (22). HEK293/
pcDNA3.1, ABCG2-482-G2, ABCG2-482-R5, and ABCG2-482-T7 cells were
established by selection with G418 after transfecting HEK293 with either
empty pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1 vector containing full-length ABCG2 coding
arginine (R), glycine (G), or threonine (T) at amino acid 482 position, and
were cultured in medium with 2 mg/mL of G418 (23). All the cell lines
were grown as adherent monolayers in flasks with DMEM (Hyclone Co.)
containing 10% bovine serum at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere of
5% CO2.

Preparation of membrane vesicles and total cell lysates. Membrane
vesicles were prepared by the nitrogen cavitation method as previously
described (24). Vesicles were stored at 80jC until ready for use. To prepare
the total cell lysates, cells were harvested and rinsed twice with PBS.
Cell extracts were prepared with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer
(1  PBS, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 Ag/mL
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 Ag/mL aprotinin, 10 Ag/mL leupeptin) for
30 min with occasional rocking and clarified by centrifugation at 12,000  g
at 4jC for 15 min. The supernatant containing total cell lysates was stored
at 80jC until ready for use. The protein concentration was determined
by the Bradford method. High Five insect cells (Invitrogen) were infected
with the recombinant baculovirus carrying the human MDR1 or ABCG2
cDNAs with a His6 tag at the COOH-terminal end [BV-MDR1(His6) or
BV-ABCG2(His10)] as described previously (25). The membrane vesicles of
High Five insect cells were prepared as previously described (26) and stored
at 70jC.
Western blot analysis. Identical amounts of total cell lysates (50 Ag) or
membrane vesicles (15 Ag) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. After
being incubated in blocking solution in TBST buffer [10 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 8.0), 150 mmol/L NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20] for 1 h at room
temperature, the membranes were immunoblotted overnight with primary
monoclonal antibodies against ABCB1 or actin at 1:200 dilution or ABCG2
at 1:500 dilution at 4jC and were then incubated overnight at 4jC with
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated secondary antibody (1:1,000
dilution). The protein-antibody complex was detected by chemoluminescence. The protein expression was quantified by Scion Image software
(Scion Co.).
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cytotoxicity assay. Cells were harvested with trypsin and resuspended at a final
concentration of 4  104/mL for KB-3-1 and 7.5  104/mL for all other cell
lines. Aliquots (160 AL) for each cell suspension were distributed evenly into
96-well multiplates. For reversal experiments, different concentrations of
chemotherapeutic drugs (20 AL/well) were added into designated wells after
erlotinib, verapamil, or fumitremorgin C (20 AL/well) was added. After 68 h,
20 AL of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) solution (4 mg/mL) were added to each well, and the plate was
further incubated for 4 h, allowing viable cells to change the yellow MTT
into dark-blue formazan crystals. Subsequently, the medium was discarded,
and 100 AL of DMSO were added into each well to dissolve the formazan
crystals. The absorbance in individual wells was determined at 570 nm with
an OPSYS microplate Reader from DYNEX Technologies, Inc. The IC50
values were calculated from survival curves using the Bliss method (27).
Paclitaxel and mitoxantrone accumulation. The accumulation of
paclitaxel in KB-3-1 and KB-C2 cells was measured with [3H]paclitaxel as
previously described (28), and the accumulation of mitoxantrone in ABCG2
related cells were measured with [3H]mitoxantrone. The confluent cells in
24-well plates were preincubated with or without the reversal agents for
1 h at 37jC. To measure drug accumulation, the cells were then incubated
with 0.1 Amol/L [3H]paclitaxel or 0.2 Amol/L [3H]mitoxantrone for 2 h in the
presence or absence of the reversal agents at 37jC. After washing thrice
with ice-cold PBS, the cells were trypsinized and lysed in 10 mmol/L lysis
buffer (pH 7.4; containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% SDS). Each sample was
placed in scintillation fluid and radioactivity was measured in a Packard
TRI-CARB 1900CA liquid scintillation analyzer from Packard Instrument
Co., Inc.
In vitro transport assays. Transport assays were done essentially using
the rapid filtration method as previously described (29). Assays were carried
out at 37jC for 10 min in a total volume of 50-AL medium [10 Ag membrane
vesicles, 0.25 mol/L sucrose, 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mmol/L MgCl2,
4 mmol/L ATP or AMP, 10 mmol/L phosphocreatine, 100 Ag/mL creatine
phosphokinase, and 0.25 Amol/L [3H]E217hG or 0.5 Amol/L [3H]methotrexate]. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 3-mL ice-cold stop solution
[0.25 mol/L sucrose, 100 mmol/L NaCl, and 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)].
For the rapid filtration step, samples were passed through 0.22-Am GVWP
filters (Millipore Corp.) presoaked in the stop solution. The filters were
washed thrice with 3-mL ice-cold stop solution. Radioactivity was measured

by the use of a liquid scintillation counter. For inhibition experiments,
membrane vesicles were incubated with various concentrations of drugs for
1 h on ice, and then transport reactions were carried out for 10 min at 37jC
in uptake medium containing 4 mmol/L ATP.
ATPase assay of ABCB1 and ABCG2. The Vi-sensitive ATPase activity
of ABCB1 and ABCG2 in membrane vesicles of High Five insect cells was
measured as previously described (30). The membrane vesicles (10 Ag of
protein) were incubated in ATPase assay buffer [50 mmol/L MES (pH 6.8),
50 mmol/L KCl, 5 mmol/L sodium azide, 2 mmol/L EGTA, 2 mmol/L DTT,
1 mmol/L ouabain, and 10 mmol/L MgCl2] with or without 0.3 mmol/L
vanadate at 37jC for 5 min, then incubated with different concentrations of
drugs at 37jC for 3 min. The ATPase reaction was induced by the addition
of 5 mmol/L MgATP, and the total volume was 0.1 mL. After incubation at
37jC for 20 min, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.1-mL
5% SDS solution. The liberated inorganic phosphate (Pi) was measured as
described (30).
Photoaffinity labeling of ABCB1 and ABCG2 with [125I]IAAP. The
photoaffinity labeling of ABCB1 and ABCG2 with [125I]IAAP was done as
previously described (31). We have used the crude membranes from MCF-7/
Flv1000 cells expressing R482 ABCG2 and membrane vesicles of High Five
insect cells expressing ABCB1 for photolabeling experiments. The
membranes (50 Ag of protein) were incubated at room temperature with
different concentrations of drugs in the ATPase assay buffer with [125I]IAAP
(7 nmol/L) for 5 min under subdued light. The samples were photo-crosslinked with 365-nm UV light for 10 min at room temperature. ABCG2 was
immunoprecipitated with BXP-21 antibody (32) whereas ABCB1 was
immunoprecipitated as described previously except that C219 antibody
was used (33). The samples were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE in a 7%
Tris-acetate NuPAGE gel; the gels were dried and exposed to Bio-Max MR
film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at 70jC for 8 to 12 h. The radioactivity
incorporated into ABCB1 or ABCG2 band was quantified using the STORM
860 PhosphorImager system and ImageQuaNT (Molecular Dynamics).
Statistical analysis. All experiments were repeated at least two to three
times and the differences were determined by using the Student t test. The
significance was determined at P < 0.05.

Results
Erlotinib potentiates the sensitivity of anticancer drugs in
the ABCB1- and ABCG2-overexpressing cells. To investigate the

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (22). November 15, 2007

effect of erlotinib-induced reversal of ABCB1-, ABCG2-, and
ABCC1-mediated MDR in cancer cells, we first examined the
cytotoxicity of erlotinib in all cell lines by using the MTT assay.
Erlotinib was not toxic to all cell lines used in this study (the IC50
values were all >50 Amol/L; data not shown), and erlotinib at
10 Amol/L showed no cytotoxicity in any of the cell lines. Therefore,
10 Amol/L was used as the highest reversal concentration of erlotinib. Second, we determined whether erlotinib could potentiate
the sensitivity of chemotherapeutic drugs in ABCB1-overexpressing
MDR cancer cells. The levels of ABCB1 expression in KB-3-1 and
KB-C2 cells are shown in Fig. 1A, and the IC50 values of
chemotherapeutic agents in both cell lines in the presence or
absence of erlotinib are shown in Table 1. Compared with the
parental KB-3-1 cells, KB-C2 cells showed high resistance to
colchicine, vinblastine, and paclitaxel, which are all substrates of
ABCB1. Erlotinib at 2.5 Amol/L slightly decreased the IC50 values of
colchicine, vinblastine, and paclitaxel in KB-C2 cells and partially
reversed their resistance; contrastingly, erlotinib at 10 Amol/L
lowered these values more significantly and reversed most of their
resistance. In the parental KB-3-1 cells, the IC50 values of
colchicine, vinblastine, and paclitaxel in the presence or absence
of erlotinib showed no significant difference. The reversal effect of
erlotinib at 10 Amol/L in KB-C2 cells was a little weaker than that
of verapamil at 10 Amol/L, but verapamil at 10 Amol/L also
enhanced the cytotoxicity in KB-3-1 cells a little more. However,
KB-3-1 and KB-C2 cells were equally sensitive to the non-ABCB1
substrate cisplatin, and this was not affected by erlotinib. Next, the
reversal effect of erlotinib on ABCC1 (MRP1)-mediated MDR was
determined. In KB-CV60 cells, erlotinib at 10 Amol/L did not
reduce the IC50 value of vincristine (a substrate of ABCC1) and did
not significantly reduce vincristine resistance (data not shown).
Recent studies have shown that mutations at amino acid 482 in
ABCG2 affect the substrate and antagonist specificity of ABCG2
(23, 34); therefore, we investigated the reversal effect of erlotinib on
both wild-type (R482) and mutated (R482G and R482T) ABCG2–
mediated MDR. The levels of ABCG2 expression in HEK293/
pcDNA3, ABCG2-482-G2, ABCG2-482-R5, and ABCG2-482-T7 cells

are shown in Fig. 1B. As shown in Table 2, the IC50 values of
flavopiridol, mitoxantrone, and SN-38 in three ABCG2-transfected
cell lines, ABCG2-482-R5, ABCG2-482-G2, and ABCG2-482-T7, were
higher than those in their parental cell line HEK293/pcDNA3.
Erlotinib at 2.5 and 10 Amol/L mostly reduced the IC50 values of
flavopiridol, mitoxantrone, and SN-38 and reversed their resistance
in either wild-type or mutated ABCG2–overexpressing cells, and
the reversal effects of erlotinib at 10 Amol/L were similar with the
reversal effects of a known specific ABCG2 inhibitor, fumitremorgin
C, at 2.5 Amol/L. In HEK293/pcDNA3 cells, the IC50 values of
flavopiridol, mitoxantrone, and SN-38 in the presence or absence of
erlotinib showed no significant difference (Table 2). Meanwhile,
erlotinib did not alter the IC50 values of cisplatin, which is not a
substrate of ABCG2 in all cell lines. These results suggest that
erlotinib specifically potentiates the sensitivity of ABCB1 substrates
in the ABCB1-overexpressing cells and also enhances the sensitivity
of ABCG2 substrates in both wild-type and R482G/T mutant
ABCG2–overexpressing cells we tested.
Erlotinib increases the accumulation of [3H]paclitaxel or
3
[ H]mitoxantrone in the ABCB1- or ABCG2-overexpressing
cells. To determine the effect of erlotinib on the function of
ABCB1, we measured the accumulation of [3H]paclitaxel in the
presence or absence of erlotinib in KB-3-1 and KB-C2 cell lines.
The results of the accumulation of [3H]paclitaxel are shown in
Fig. 2A. The levels of intracellular [3H]paclitaxel in KB-C2 cells
were f25% of that in KB-3-1 cells. Erlotinib at 10 Amol/L
increased the intracellular accumulation of [3H]paclitaxel in KBC2 cells to levels f3.5-fold higher and this effect was comparable
to that of 10 Amol/L verapamil. Neither erlotinib nor verapamil
alters the intracellular accumulation of [3H]paclitaxel in the

parental KB-3-1 cells (Fig. 2A). Subsequently, we examined the
accumulation of [3H]mitoxantrone in ABCG2-overexpressing cells
and their parental cells. As depicted in Fig. 2B, in all ABCG2overexpressing cells, erlotinib, at 2.5 and 10 Amol/L, concentration-dependently increased the intracellular accumulation of
[3H]mitoxantrone, and the effects of erlotinib at 10 Amol/L were
almost to the same extent as fumitremorgin C at 2.5 Amol/L.
However, erlotinib did not significantly alter the intracellular
accumulation of [3H]mitoxantrone in HEK293/pcDNA3 cells.
These data suggested that erlotinib might directly inhibit the
drug efflux function of ABCB1 and ABCG2, resulting in the
increase of the intracellular accumulation of [3H]paclitaxel and
[3H]mitoxantrone.
Erlotinib does not alter the expression of ABCB1 and
ABCG2. The reversal of ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated MDR can be
achieved either by decreasing ABCB1 and ABCG2 expression or by
inhibiting their activities. To study the effect of erlotinib on ABCB1
and ABCG2 expression, we incubated KB-C2 and MCF-7/Flv1000
cells with erlotinib at 10 Amol/L for 36 and 72 h. The results of
Western blot are shown in Fig. 1C and D, indicating that the
protein levels of ABCB1 in KB-C2 cells and ABCG2 in MCF-7/
Flv1000 cells were not altered by 10 Amol/L erlotinib treatment.
This experiment suggests that erlotinib does not affect the
expression of ABCB1 and ABCG2 for 3-day treatment of MDR
cancer cells.
Erlotinib inhibits the transport of E217BG and methotrexate
by ABCG2. ABCG2 is an ATP-dependent membrane efflux pump,
which is able to transport several anticancer drugs or their
metabolized production, leading to drug resistance. To investigate
the effect of erlotinib on the transport activity of ABCG2, we used

the membrane vesicles prepared from HEK293/pcDNA3, ABCG2482-G2, ABCG2-482-R5, and ABCG2-482-T7 cells. First, the
physiologic substrate E217hG was used as the transport substance
of ABCG2. As shown in Fig. 3A, the rates of ATP-dependent uptake
of E217hG were significantly different only in the membrane
vesicles of ABCG2-482-R5 cells but not in the membrane vesicles of
other cell lines. Subsequently, we carried out inhibition experiments using membrane vesicles prepared from HEK293/pcDNA3
and ABCG2-482-R5 cells. The effects of erlotinib on the transport
of E217hG by ABCG2 are shown in Fig. 3B. The rates of E217hG
uptake were significantly inhibited by erlotinib in a concentrationdependent manner, but the inhibition effect of erlotinib was a little
weaker than that of fumitremorgin C. Second, the anticancer drug
methotrexate was used as the transport substrate of ABCG2. We
found that the transport results of methotrexate were consistent
with those of E217hG. Similarly, the rates of ATP-dependent uptake
of methotrexate were significantly different only in the membrane
vesicles of ABCG2-482-R5 cells (Fig. 3C); the rates of methotrexate
uptake were concentration-dependently inhibited by erlotinib;
and the inhibition effect of erlotinib was weaker than that of
fumitremorgin C (Fig. 3D). These transport results suggest that
among the wild-type and variant ABCG2, only wild-type ABCG2
is able to ATP-dependently transport E217hG and methotrexate,
and erlotinib inhibits the transport of E217hG and methotrexate by
wild-type ABCG2.
Erlotinib activates the ATPase activity of ABCB1 and
ABCG2. The drug efflux function of ABCB1 and ABCG2 is
coupled to ATP hydrolysis, which is stimulated in the presence of
ABCB1 and ABCG2 substrates. To assess the effect of erlotinib on

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (22). November 15, 2007

the ATPase activity of ABCB1 and ABCG2, we measured the
ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated ATP hydrolysis using various
concentrations of erlotinib under conditions that suppressed
the activity of other major membrane ATPases. As shown in
Fig. 4A and B, erlotinib concentration-dependently enhanced the
ATPase activity of ABCB1 and ABCG2. Furthermore, the
maximum stimulated ATPase activities of ABCB1 and ABCG2
by erlotinib were up to 76.70 and 104.15 nmol Pi/mg protein/min,
respectively, and the concentrations of erlotinib required for 50%
stimulation of ATPase activity of ABCB1 and ABCG2 were 4.93
and 0.17 Amol/L, respectively. These data indicate that erlotinib
may be the substrate of ABCB1 and ABCG2, although the ABCB1or ABCG2-expressing cells do not exhibit resistance to erlotinib,
which is most likely because of the very low toxicity of this drug
(IC50 >50 Amol/L).
Erlotinib differentially affects the photolabeling of ABCB1
and ABCG2 with [125I]IAAP. ABCB1 and ABCG2 can be photolabeled by their transport substrate [125I]IAAP, and their substrates
as well as inhibitors can compete with [125I]IAAP for binding to
ABCB1 and ABCG2 (32). We examined the photolabeling of ABCB1
and ABCG2 with [125I]IAAP by using the membrane vesicles in the
presence of various concentrations of erlotinib to primarily
understand the physical interaction of erlotinib with the substrate
interaction sites of ABCB1 and ABCG2. As indicated in Fig. 4C
and D, erlotinib only slightly inhibited the photoaffinity labeling
of ABCB1 with [125I]IAAP at a concentration of 100 Amol/L.
However, 10 Amol/L cyclosporine A, an inhibitor of ABCB1, almost
completely blocked the ABCB1 photolabeling of [125I]IAAP, and
verapamil at 20 Amol/L showed inhibition by up to 50%. Moreover,

erlotinib at 1 to 100 Amol/L did not affect the photolabeling of
ABCG2 with [125I]IAAP, but the ABCG2 inhibitor fumitremorgin C
at 20 Amol/L decreased the ABCG2 photolabeling of [125I]IAAP to
f50% of the control group. Therefore, these results suggest that
erlotinib differentially affects the photolabeling of ABCB1 and
ABCG2.

Discussion
Erlotinib is an orally available, potent, reversible, and selective
small-molecule inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase (35). It has
been reported that erlotinib (a) inhibits human EGFR tyrosine
kinase, (b) reduces EGFR autophosphorylation in intact tumor
cells with nmol/L IC50 values, and (c) blocks cell cycle progression
in the G1 phase and induces apoptosis (36). Based on a randomized
double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial (37), erlotinib was
approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in
November 2004 for treatment of locally advanced or metastatic
non–small-cell lung cancer after failure of at least one prior
chemotherapy regimen. Most recently, the FDA approved erlotinib
for use in combination with gemcitabine as first-line treatment
of patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic
pancreatic cancer based on the improvement of overall and
progression-free survival in a phase III trial (38). Erlotinib is also
under investigation in several other tumor types, including head

and neck, breast, colon, and ovarian cancer, in combination with
chemotherapy and other targeted therapies (35).
In the present study, we showed for the first time that erlotinib
potentiated the sensitivity of established ABCB1 and ABCG2
substrates and increased the accumulation of paclitaxel or
mitoxantrone in either ABCB1- or ABCG2-overexpressing cells.
Furthermore, erlotinib did not alter the sensitivity of non-ABCB1 or
non-ABCG2 substrates in all cells and also could not reverse
ABCC1-mediated MDR. These data suggested that the reversal
effect of erlotinib on MDR could be specific to ABCB1 and ABCG2.
In addition, the results of ATPase analysis showed that erlotinib
significantly enhanced the ATPase activity of both ABCB1 and
ABCG2 in a concentration-dependent manner. A majority of
substrates that interact with the ABC drug transporters stimulate
the ATP hydrolysis, and the fact that the presence of erlotinib
stimulated the ATP hydrolysis by both ABCB1 and ABCG2
suggested that it behaved similarly to the known substrates of
these transporters. These data led us to speculate on the direct
interaction of the compound with the transporters. Further
experiments with either the radiolabeled erlotinib in an accumulation assay or the photoaffinity analogue of erlotinib in a binding
assay would provide conclusive evidence for the direct interaction
of erlotinib with these transporters. While this article was in
preparation, a new publication suggested that erlotinib is the
substrate of ABCG2 (39); this supports our above ATPase results.

Figure 3. Effect of erlotinib on the transport of E217hG and methotrexate by ABCG2. Membrane vesicles (10 Ag) were prepared from HEK293/pcDNA3,
ABCG2-482-G2, ABCG2-482-R5, and ABCG2-482-T7 cells. The rates of the uptake of [3H]E217hG (A and B ) and [3H]methotrexate (MTX; C and D ) into membrane
vesicles were measured for 10 min at 37jC in uptake medium containing 4 mmol/L of ATP or AMP. For inhibition experiments, membrane vesicles from HEK293/
pcDNA3.1 and ABCG2-482-R5 cells were incubated with various concentrations of erlotinib or fumitremorgin C for 1 h on ice, and then transport reactions were carried
out for 10 min at 37jC in uptake medium containing 4 mmol/L ATP. Columns, mean of triplicate determinations; bars, SD. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01, versus the
control group. Experiments were done at least three independent times, and a representative experiment is shown.

The in vitro concentrations of erlotinib used in our experiments
are similar to those obtained in plasma after therapeutic treatment
(40, 41). Therefore, the reversal effects shown in the present study
would be sufficient for reversing ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated drug
resistance in vivo. However, the tissue distribution of ABCB1 and
ABCG2 is very broad in the body. For example, ABCB1 is highly
expressed in the adrenal and the kidney whereas ABCG2 is highly
expressed in the placenta, liver, and intestine, and the blood-brain
barrier expresses both ABCB1 and ABCG2 (2). Therefore, when the
combination of erlotinib with ABCB1 and ABCG2 substrates is
applied in the clinic, erlotinib may affect the plasma concentrations
and tissue distribution of these drugs, resulting in adverse effects
because erlotinib may also inhibit ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated
drug transport in normal cells. In fact, when the combination of
gefitinib with camptothecins was used in mice, gefitinib was able
to increase oral absorption of camptothecins, reduce topotecan
clearance (16), enhance the oral bioavailability of irinotecan (17), and
increase the topotecan brain extracellular fluid penetration while
decreasing its ventricular cerebrospinal fluid penetration (18).
Interestingly, when the photolabeling of ABCB1 and ABCG2 with
[125I]IAAP was used to elucidate the binding site of erlotinib on the
pumps, we found that erlotinib differentially affected the photoaffinity labeling of ABCB1 and ABCG2 with [125I]IAAP. The results
show that erlotinib slightly inhibited the photolabeling of ABCB1 at

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (22). November 15, 2007

high concentrations but did not inhibit the photolabeling of ABCG2.
However, these high concentrations of erlotinib are not physiologically relevant as the reported steady-state plasma concentration in
patients after the recommended dose of 150 mg/d is 3 to 5 Amol/L
(40). In our results of transport by ABCG2 vesicles, E217hG and
methotrexate are only transported by the wild-type ABCG2 and not
by the two mutated R482G and R482T ABCG2. This is consistent
with our previous study (29) and provides an explanation for
a recent finding that showed that among a panel of ABCG2overexpressing drug-resistant cell lines, only the wild-type ABCG2–
expressing cells had the ability to mediate methotrexate resistance
(42). Furthermore, the transport of E217hG and methotrexate by
ABCG2 is inhibited by erlotinib in a concentration-dependent
manner. This provides direct evidence for the first time that the
reversal effect of erlotinib on ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated MDR is
based on the inhibition of the transport function of these two
pumps by erlotinib. The other evidence is that erlotinib had no
effect on the expression levels of ABCB1 in KB-C2 cells and ABCG2
in MCF-7/Flv1000 cells. However, in this study, we did not examine
and could not exclude the effects of erlotinib on the EGFR signaling
pathway. Although the concentrations of erlotinib used in the
current study were sufficient to block the EGFR signaling pathway,
we did not observe any significant effect on the growth and survival
of cells (data not shown).

Reversal of ABCB1- and ABCG2-Mediated MDR by Erlotinib

Recently, Cusatis et al. (43) reported that one common functional
single-nucleotide polymorphism in the ABCG2 gene, ABCG2
421C!A (Q141K), is associated with diarrhea, which is a
gefitinib-induced adverse effect, and led to a high risk of diarrhea
in patients treated with oral gefitinib. The same group also showed
that this functional variant of ABCG2 is associated with greater
gefitinib accumulation at steady state and may be relevant to the
toxicity and antitumor activity of EGFR TKIs (39). These findings
suggest that the functional variants of ABCB1 or ABCG2 in patients
may affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics not only
of established ABCB1 and ABCG2 substrates such as camptothecins
and mitoxantrone but also of novel molecular target anticancer
drugs such as gefitinib. Therefore, these functional variants can
cause alterations in the adverse events and therapeutic effects of
chemotherapy. Similar to gefitinib, the most frequent adverse

effects of erlotinib in patients are skin rash and diarrhea, whereas
other side effects such as headache, mucositis, hyperbilirubinemia,
neutropenia, and anemia are less common (35). Thus, these
functional variants of ABCB1 or ABCG2 in patients may also affect
the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of erlotinib, resulting
in an attenuation of its adverse events and therapeutic effects.
In conclusion, the present study shows that erlotinib significantly reverses ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated MDR in cancer cells
by directly inhibiting the drug efflux function of ABCB1 and
ABCG2, resulting in the increase of the intracellular accumulation
of the anticancer drugs. The mechanistic study found that erlotinib
stimulated the ATPase activity of these two pumps but did not
inhibit the photoaffinity labeling of the transporters with
[125I]IAAP. Both our current and previous studies showed that
gefitinib reverses ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated MDR, indicating

Figure 4. Effect of erlotinib on the ATPase activity and [125I]IAAP photoaffinity labeling of ABCB1 and ABCG2. The Vi-sensitive ATPase activity of ABCB1 (A )
and ABCG2 (B) in membrane vesicles was determined with different concentrations of erlotinib, as described in Materials and Methods. The basal ATPase activity
(in the absence of erlotinib) was subtracted from the activities obtained at the indicated erlotinib concentrations and the graph was fitted by nonlinear least-squares
regression analysis using GraphPad Prism version 2.0. Points, mean from at least three independent experiments; bars, SE. The photoaffinity labeling of ABCB1
and ABCG2 with [125I]IAAP was done with different concentrations of erlotinib. The radioactivity incorporated into ABCB1 and ABCG2 was determined by exposing the
gel to an X-ray film at 70jC. C and D, autoradiograms and quantification of incorporation of IAAP into ABCB1 and ABCG2 bands, respectively, from at least
two independent experiments. Cyclosporine A, verapamil, and fumitremorgin C were used as the positive controls for photolabeling of ABCB1 and ABCG2 by [125I]IAAP.

that this class of TKIs may have the common function of reversing
ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated MDR. Consequently, our results
support the fact that it is optimal to use the strategies of combining
established ABCB1 and ABCG2 substrate anticancer drugs with this
class of TKIs in patients.
