ABSTRACT
The introduction of new Molecularly Targeted Agents (MTA) has changed the
landscape in Early Drug Development (EDD) over the last two decades, leading to an
improvement in clinical trial design. Previous Phase 1 (Ph1) studies with cytotoxics
focused on safety objectives, only recruiting heavily pre-treated cancer patients, have
been left behind. In this review, we will illustrate the slow although unstoppable
change that has increasingly been observed in those populations candidate
to participate in EDD trials with the advent of MTA. As more evidence regarding
oncogene addiction becomes available, molecular-biomarker driven selection has been
implemented among Molecularly-Selected Population (MSP) studies. New WindowOf-Opportunity (WOO) and Phase 0 (Ph0) studies have been developed in order to
assess whether a MTA produces the hypothetical proposed biological effect. The rising
need of getting early pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics data has led to the
conduction of Healthy Volunteer (HV) studies, in part favoured for the particular and
different toxicity profile of these MTA. However, several challenges will need to be
addressed in order to boost the implementation of these new clinical trial designs
in the forthcoming years. Among the problems to overcome, we would highlight a
better coordination effort between centers for ensuring adequate patient accrual
among small patient populations and a deepening into the ethics implied in enrolling
patients in studies with no therapeutic intent. However, these tribulations will be
certainly compensated by the possibility of opening a new horizon of treatment for
diseases with dismal prognosis.

INTRODUCTION

The introduction of MTA has changed the landscape
in Early Drug Development (EDD) and subsequently, the
clinical trial design. Molecular biomarker-driven selection
of patients has progressively been incorporated, as more
evidence regarding oncogene addiction is available [2].
New dose escalation strategies are followed now, using
dose recommendation methods that help in decision
making by providing the probability of toxicities or by
incorporating chronic toxicities [3, 4]. Also, there has been
a better integration of human pharmacokinetics (PK) and
pharmacodynamics (PD). In fact, several new trial designs
can be now successfully implemented in the EDD process
further to the classical 3+3 design, such as the accelerated
titration design (ATD) and continual reassessment
method (CRM) [4]. This new designs take advantage of
incorporating supplementary endpoints that help to further
characterize the MTA in terms of efficacy (mechanism of

Over the past two decades, with the advent of new
Molecularly Targeted Agents (MTA), cancer research has
shifted from standard chemotherapies to the selective
inhibition of signaling pathways. However, while some of
these drugs have offered a significant breakthrough, new
insights into the tumor biology and drug development
are still required to further delineate rational therapeutic
strategies [1]. Phase 1 (Ph1) trials with cytotoxics are
mainly focused on safety. Traditionally, first-in-human
(FIH) studies were designed with a 3+3 dose escalation
based on acute toxicities. Considering risks and limited
efficacy, only heavily pre-treated cancer patients with no
standard effective therapies were considered candidates.
This dose-toxicity model, though, has shown to be not so
effective for testing MTA.

action -MoA-/PD biomarkers) on top of the traditional
toxicity endpoints, and also allow a fine-tune assessment
of the safety profile by evaluating the late-onset toxicities
and not only the acute ones. Finally, there is increasing
evidence that some of these MTA present a class-specific
toxicity, related to their “on-target” effect (e.g.: fibroblast
growth factor receptor inhibitors and hyperphosphatemia)
[5]. As target inhibition can cause toxicity leading to
treatment interruptions, the consideration of new optimal
schedules while maintaining the target inhibition-related
anti-tumor efficacy has become a critical key point [5].
Within this context, we are progressively witnessing
an unprecedented shift towards a completely different
population profile in EDD. To clarify in which selected

biological context the drug works, some trials include
now Molecularly Selected Patient (MSP) populations
[2]. Despite the efforts, there are still scarce predictive
biomarkers, meaning that a rising need to determine
upfront whether a MTA produces the hypothetical
biological effect exists. New Window-Of-Opportunity
(WOO) studies [6] and Phase 0 studies (Ph0) [7, 8] have
been developed in order to fill in the gap. MTA have
revolutionized previous toxicity concepts, as may not
have single direct dose-response relationship, with higher
doses lacking of further benefit after a biological effective
dose has been reached [9]. Longstanding mild toxicity
is commonly seen instead of acute intense toxicities,
with neither teratogenicity nor carcinogenic effects.

Considering their different toxicity profile [10], MTA
have favoured the conduction of Healthy Volunteer (HV)
studies [11, 12], aiming for PK and PD endpoints.
Based on these premises, we will illustrate the
change in the population of patients enrolled in early
clinical trials testing MTA.

MOLECULARLYPOPULATION STUDIES

of robust predictive biomarkers in subsets of patients
parallel to the development of MTA, could provide a
personalized therapeutic option for cancer patients lacking
of standard options. As highlighted before, that was the
case with crizotinib, the first-in-class ALK inhibitor, that
demonstrated fast and durable responses in metastatic
ALK positive NSCLC patients in early Ph1 [18, 21]
and Ph2 [22] trials. These results lead to the accelerated
crizotinib-FDA approval after a three-year development
programme, and opened the door to the pharmaceutical
companies to apply for a Fast Track designation from the
regulatory agencies. Recently, the approval of ceritinib
for NSCLC with ALK rearrangement after progression
to crizotinib, solely based on the results of the Ph1, has
supposed another milestone in the history of EDD in
Oncology [23]. This clearly shows that well conducted
Ph1 trials could accelerate the drug development,
especially where a drug could fill a void for a poor
prognosis orphan disease. This really depends on how
well designed are these early clinical trials, specially in
terms of wise collection of the generated data in order to
prove the MoA of the new MTA and to allow the analysis
of statistically meaningful preliminary data. Table 1
depicts some of the most relevant approved MTA. These
MTA have been selected in view of the impact that their
development represented for the clinical management of
these tumor subtypes.
In parallel, we are witnessing the development
of new molecular diagnostic techniques alongside to
the discovery of new aberrations. This fact has led to
a gradually narrowing of the pre-selection criteria for
candidate patients. Sometimes, a specific molecular
alteration is not a requirement for participating in a study,
but throughout the trial, an increasing number of patients
with that aberration show response, and this biomarker is
later on required for inclusion. In other cases, Ph1 trials
do pre-select patients according to a specific molecular
alteration from the early beginning. In both situations,
the tactics allows the study to enrich the population, and
might help us to early identifying the subgroup of patients
who will benefit the most from the MTA. Some of the
MTA that are contemporary being developed under strict
molecular pre-selection criteria are shown in Table 2.
Recently, the results of a meta-analysis presented by
Schwaederle MC. et al [24] showed improved outcomes
in patients treated in Ph1 trials using a biomarkerselection strategy. The analysis of over 13.203 patients
demonstrated that a more personalized approach had a
statistically improved RR (30.6% versus 4.9%, p<0.0001)
as well as a better PFS (5.7 months versus 2.9 months,
p=0.002) compared to the non-personalized option.
These data reflect the importance of delineating a better
biomarker-selection of patient candidates to participate
in early clinical trials developing MTA, as the majority
of Ph1 testing targeted agents in non-selected patients
presented trivial responses.

SELECTED

Some MTA have been already approved despite
the fact of not having identified a predictive biomarker
to associate their clinical efficacy. Multi-tyrosine kinase
inhibitors, such as sorafenib in hepatocarcinoma [13], and
sunitinib in renal cancer [14] would fall into this category.
But for the majority of these MTA, it has been key in their
development to tailor them with molecular aberrations that
harbor different tumor types. Therefore, pre-identification
of a driver alteration has become mandatory to prescribe
these MTA. Overexpression or amplification of HER2
in breast or gastric carcinomas [15], EGFR mutations in
lung carcinoma [16], and BRAF mutations in melanoma
[17], would be the best examples of tailored tumor-type
treatments. One must bear in mind that whilst some of
the MTA target molecular alterations that have not been
proven to be drivers for any specific disease (e.g. PI3KCA
mutations), other MTA target clear defined oncogenic
aberrations (e.g. EGFR mutations in non-small cell lung
cancer –NSCLC-). The molecular selection of patients will
be key in the second case for warranting the success of a
MTA in that subset of patients, but less obvious and not
mandatory in the first case.
Noteworthy, some MTA have been recently
approved after the initial studies showed impressive
response rates in subsets of MSP. Interestingly, some of
these first MTA were not initially developed for a prespecified MSP, but as the Ph1 was being conducted, early
signs of response were noticed in genomically-altered
subgroups of patients. The later enrichment confirmed the
oncogenic addiction for a specific aberration, which lead
to the MTA approval only for those subsets of patients.
That is the case of crizotinib for NSCLC with ALK
rearrangement [18].
Ph1 clinical trials have emerged as the most suitable
arena for testing the hypothetical relationship between
a predictive biomarker and the efficacy of a given drug,
driving knowledge in the right direction. The idea for
doing this very early in the development of a drug is to
test the efficacy in the best-case scenario and for assisting
in go-no go decisions [19]. By enriching early Ph1 trials
with patients harboring specific molecular alterations, it
could be demonstrated the proof-of-concept hypothesis
for the MTA mechanism and encourage its further
development [20]. But quite frequently, these markers
are not well validated, and to date, they are still used
as enrichment biomarkers. Nevertheless, the discovery

Of note, analyzing a tumor sample can easily change
the selected population. Firstly, where a fresh tumor
sample is required, patients deemed not biopsiable might
have less chances of trial inclusion. Also, patients are at
risk of deteriorating while waiting for a complex biomarker
assessment (central review), biasing the trial towards
healthier patients, and notice that inadequate or too strict
molecular pre-screening criteria may considerably slow
down the recruitment. Secondly, patients whose tumor
bears the pre-specified alteration may be recruited even if
standard therapies have not been exhausted yet, based on
increased expectations for response. It is worth noticing
that not all patients that are tested positive for the selection
biomarker would be finally considered eligible for a trial,
therefore molecular selection can sometimes generate
false hope for patients. Finally, patients may be excluded
based on an insufficiently validated biomarker.
In fact, the identification of suitable biomarkers
has become one of the main priorities in parallel with the
development of new MTA, although it has proven to be
challenging [25]. Predictive biomarkers are patient and/or
disease characteristics that can be objectively measured,
indicating subgroup of patients who are most likely to
benefit from a therapy [26, 27]. Whenever developing a
biomarker, researchers have to keep in mind that a feasible
assay should be validated according to a “fit-for-purpose”
approach, in order to ensure accuracy and reproducibility
of the detection assay [28]. Nevertheless, differences in
sample acquisition and processing, assay implementation
and analysis across different centers, can be counted as
certain of the hurdles to overcome. In addition, knowing
the intrinsic tumor heterogeneity [29], it should be
considered that a negative biomarker sample does not
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

specifically mean that the patient cannot yet benefit from
the study drug.
We are facing an era where there will be increasing
evidences that several tumors could be categorized by
specific molecular changes that drive their proliferation.
The hypothesis that blocking an activated oncogenic
pathway will lead to tumor control warrants further
efforts to determine biomarkers for facilitating this
patient population identification. In our opinion, a better
delineation of genomic pre-screening strategies seems to
be the right direction for identifying those patients who
may achieve greater benefit from an MTA, and could
avoid unnecessary toxicities to patients who are less
likely to benefit from this drugs, minimizing the risks
and developmental costs of highly expensive targeted
therapies. However, one should be aware of the level of
validation of the selection biomarker and its companion
diagnostic assay, before switching the participating patient
population towards less pre-treated patients.

WINDOW- OF- OPPORTUNITY STUDIES
The development of MTA and the need of testing
their biological effect have highlighted the convenience of
implementing new trial designs, considering that the MTA
activity may be shadowed in advanced oncology patients,
because of previous cytotoxic resistances, residual
toxicities or high tumor burden conferring high intratumor heterogeneity. WOO studies have been considered
one of the best scenarios for testing MTA and biomarker
development, as patients receive the MTA for a short
period of time -concept of window- just before performing
the standard treatment. Aiming to evaluate the key target

modulation accordingly to the drug exposure levels,
the objective is to deepen into the proof-of-mechanism
anti-tumor activity of the MTA in a cancer stage that is
not altered by previous therapies. The main goals are
to confirm the biological effect of the MTA and its PK
properties, together with validating possible biomarkers
that could predict subgroups of patients most likely to
benefit. However, no clinical benefit is pursued for the
treated patients [30].
WOO trials have been developed in the neo-adjuvant
setting [31] but differ from traditional neo-adjuvant trials
[32] in the limited treatment duration, the non-therapeutic
intent, and the focus on biomarkers of the former MTA in
comparison to the use of pathological complete response
(pCR) of the latters [33]. Whilst traditional neo-adjuvant
trials focus on evaluating the anti-tumor activity of a
certain drug by assessing the pCR rate, WOO studies aim
to further characterize the biological activity of the new
experimental therapy with PK/PD objectives as principal
end-points.
WOO studies allow obtaining an unperturbed tissue
specimen, appropriate to validate pathway inhibition by
the MTA in the same tumor sample and to assess potential
compensating feedback loops to better understand crosstalked resistance pathways. WOO studies may represent
proof-of-biological efficacy/mechanism studies which
serve as an early step before further phase 2/3 proofof-clinical efficacy studies [34]. Basically, WOO neowww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

adjuvant studies among women with early large primary
breast cancers have been performed with this design [6], as
depicted in Table 3. As these WOO studies have changed
the concept that curable patients may be treated with an
experimental drug for interrogating biological questions,
breast cancer patients have been considered one of the
most feasible settings considering that radical surgery of
the primary tumor is often indicated as first therapeutic
option.
Interestingly, many WOO studies are usually
performed just after the exploration of a MTA in FIH
studies. This observation reflects two issues: firstly, that
biological activity might be a key aspect in EDD, assisting
in go-no go decisions very early in the drug development
process. Secondly, curable patients are exposed to
experimental MTA that have been previously explored in
small cohorts of patients. While this last observation may
be due to the relatively favorable profile of these MTA,
it also reflects a change in the paradigm of the type of
patients enrolled in clinical trials with experimental drugs.
But despite all the advantages that represent
the WOO studies, why have they not been routinely
implemented for drug development so far? WOO studies
have been widely debated, considering the ethical
implications involved in delaying upfront standard
approved therapies. However, in our opinion, WOO trials
emerge as a very useful tool for facilitating the accelerated
development program of a certain drug, shortening the

laborious process of evaluating a new MTA. As long as
safety monitoring and careful candidate pre-selection
are performed, WOO studies may optimize and increase
the chances of success of a specific MTA from the
early beginning, as the failure to achieve the predefined
objectives in the study may be a sign for not continuing
with its development. Also, it has to be considered that
patients included in WOO trials may truly reflect the real
intention-to-treat population compared to the heavily pretreated Ph1 patients. Nevertheless, intense efforts should
be done in order to ensure that patients understand the
risk/benefit ratio of participating in these clinical trials, to
warrant precocious detection of disease progression and to
avoid enrolling unfit patients [35]. Maybe because of this
risk/benefit ratio, most of the WOO trials testing MTA in
the neo-adjuvant setting have included well-known drugs.
In reality, as depicted in table 3, very few of them include
experimental drugs in early stages of their development,
with most of the WOO studies published in the literature
examining drugs that are already transitioning to the late
development process.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Despite their appealing potential, moving an
experimental therapy with a limited long-term toxicity
profile experience to the neo-adjuvant setting, with
curable untreated patients, may be carefully considered.
That is the reason why WOO studies should only be
considered and acceptable in populations with a high
risk of relapse and a significant unmet medical need (e.g.
patients with high grade, hormone receptor positive and
HER2-negative breast cancers). It should be kept in mind
that not all drugs are suitable for being tested in a WOO
trial, as only some drugs with a plausible biological MoA
thought to be involved in cancer modulation, with a welldescribed toxicity profile and displaying particular PK/
PD characteristics, can be considered good candidates for
being explored in this setting. As example, the oral antidiabetic drug, metformin, is currently moving towards
a new classification as a potential cancer metabolismtargeted drug, due to the underlying link between obesity
and hyper-insulinemia and breast cancer [36]. However,
the clinical translation of metformin as a new anti-cancer
therapy has been limited by the lack of PD biomarkers (e.g.
14164

Oncotarget

Ki67 % or proliferative index) that could translate into an
early read out of its biological activity in cancer patients so
far. On top of that, as most of the preclinical studies do not
have an appropriate PK design, some of the limited results
obtained in in vivo and in vitro experiments may be related
to the suboptimal doses tested of metformin [37]. One
of the strengths of metformin is that its short and longterm toxicity effects are already well-described, and the
drug is deemed safe and widely implemented in the daily
care of millions of diabetic patients. Testing metformin
in a WOO clinical trial design [6] could provide more
insights into the clinical PK/PD of the drug in an optimal
model that mimics the real patient scenario. The WOO
strategy will help to better illustrate its PD mechanism of
action (whether the administration of metformin reduces
the proliferation of tumoral cells by assessing the Ki67
proliferative index in surgical specimens) and to optimize
a relevant and achievable drug concentration in plasma by
obtaining detailed PK data. Therefore, the PD/PK data will
help in delineating future large scale randomized clinical
trials, maximizing the chance of success of metformin as
a new anti-cancer strategy.

must have a minimum of toxicology package and certain
knowledge of the PK properties of the drug evaluated.
Previous extensive preclinical experiments are required to
establish a safe starting dose and schedule, in order to help
in predicting the plasmatic levels of the MTA (PD data)
that are required for target modulation (PK data) without
reaching a therapeutic level [42].
Despite the fact that some experts in EDD consider
that such trials will become a routine of the field in
the future [42], we could only find few examples of
contemporary trials with this design, probably because
of the previously mentioned challenges and that similar
information can be achieved with the regular Ph1 trial
designs. It is worth noticing that many of them were
published as Ph0 trials, although they do not fulfill the
criteria for a Ph0 design, as shown in Table 4. Most of
these studies include drugs with a significant clinical
experience, which should be called “biomarker-driven”
studies. Among the properly Ph0 trials detected,
new imaging compounds have been tested, such as
the 11C-labeled topoisomerase I/II inhibitor N-[2(dimethylamino)ethyl]acridine-4-carboxamide (DACA)
[43]. Ph0 trials could be also focused on determining
pharmacologically relevant doses of a certain drug, such as
imatinib [44], or they could assess the MoA/PD markers
of new compounds, like the ABT-888 [7] or the STAT3
decoy oligonucleotide [8].
Further efforts to improve their design limitations
seem mandatory, as they may be a promising field to
get data from a new compound in early phases of its
development.

PHASE 0 STUDIES
By definition, Ph0 trials are clinical studies
conducted in EDD before the traditional Ph1 studies,
to provide human PK and PD data, benefiting EDD by
allowing to clinically testing a proposed MoA. They are
FIH trials with neither therapeutic nor diagnostic intent,
with a low number of patients included and limited drug
exposure. Part of the rationale for conducting them is
that the new agent promises significant biological effect
in a substantial percentage of participants, even at doses
below the expected ones that could lead to toxicity [38].
However, several limitations of the Ph0 have made highly
controversial their implementation, such as their intense
resource use and complexity, the request of serial tumor
biopsies, the requirement of analytical methods that are not
routinely available, and specially, the lack of therapeutic
purpose for the treated patients [39].
The Ph0 concept implies a change in role of studies
in Oncology. In Ph0 studies, candidates assume the role
of “sick volunteers” given the absence of any direct
efficacy for the participant, closer to the HV concept –see
next section- [40]. The main motivator may be altruism
for the “benefit to others”. Hence, Ph0 trials are both
ethically challenged and challenging, since the patient
has to understand that clinical benefit is not pursued,
and that even if the risks seem low, there is a high
degree of uncertainty regarding potential toxicities [41].
Under these circumstances, only patients with advanced
incurable malignancies should be recruited after failure
of standard therapy or in case that their indolent diseases
do not require immediate treatment. Furthermore, not all
MTA can be explored within a Ph0 context. Ideally, one

HEALTHY VOLUNTEER STUDIES
Outside the Oncology field, it is common that
the introduction of a new drug in patients is tested
firstly in HV, limiting human exposure. Designing the
appropriate FIH dose requires close collaboration among
the toxicologists and the preclinical scientists, to use
modeling data from animal experiments to determine a
safe starting dose and a dosing interval [45]. The definition
of HV per se is challenging. The widely accepted
definition comprises those healthy, adult volunteers,
in well-defined and controlled conditions. However,
this definition underlies several margins of discretion
regarding the wellness of a patient, and a critical judgment
is mandatory when enrolling a candidate. Several ethical
concerns arouse in 2006 with The TeGenero incident
[46], where TGN1412 caused life-threatening toxicities
and fostered the implementation of strict guidelines
for EDD. Subsequently, specific rules were developed
to guide HV studies [47]. These HV studies should be
conducted in units with sufficient expertise, and their usual
characteristics include: 1) A single subject receives the
first dose within a justified period of observation before
the next subject receives another dose, 2) double-blind
14165

Oncotarget

design is preferred to avoid risks of bias, 3) subjects are
randomly assigned to receive either the active drug or the
placebo/control drug, and 4) different designs are used
(parallel, crossover and sequential groups) based on the
objectives of the study.
In Oncology, though, most anticancer agents have
been tested only in advanced cancer patients assuming
their potential severe side effects, mutagenicity and
carcinogenesis, accepting higher degrees of toxicity
considering that these secondary effects would be less
threatening than the disease itself [48]. Interestingly, new
MTA have started to be explored in HV studies recently.
This is probably based on their relatively broaden safety
profile and because these HV are more able to withstand
any unexpected toxicity from these new molecular entities
[49]. However, careful consideration must be taken
in view of the novelty of their MoA. We may not fully
know the exact MoA for a specific MTA by the time we

initiate early studies, therefore special attention is required
in view of possible interactions between biological
cascades. The risk with MTA could emerge not only from
their chemical structure but also from their biologic or
intended pharmacological mechanisms [50]. As example,
some MTA have revealed delayed severe side effects (e.g.
pneumonitis with mTOR inhibitors [51, 52]) and many
combinations of MTA have proven to be challenging in
terms of overlapping toxicities [53, 54].
The types of studies done in HV in Oncology
include:
1.	 Drug-drug and food-drug interaction studies,
conducted to investigate what concomitant
medications or food/drink products can interfere
with the pharmacokinetic characteristics of a
tested MTA [11, 12].
2.	 Cardiovascular safety studies are required if
the new MTA shows potential cardiovascular

Figure 1: Depicting the journey of a cancer patient through the different new clinical trial designs in the Early Drug
Development field. The development of novel Molecularly Targeted Agents (MTA) has lead to the possibility of receiving these anti-

cancer drugs in new patient populations. Noteworthy, one single patient could aim to participate in each one of the four types of studies
here depicted throughout the evolution of his/her cancer. Being in good health status, the individual could participate in a Healthy Volunteer
(HV) study, sometimes even decades before developing a premalignant lesion. Once diagnosed with an early invasive localized cancer,
the patient may be considered candidate for receiving neo-adjuvant therapy according to the gold standard approach. It is in this same
neo-adjuvant setting where the patient could consider to participate in a Window-Of-Opportunity (WOO) study, before proceeding with
a radical surgery and adjuvancy. Whenever a metastatic disease recurrence occurs, the evaluation of a potential novel cancer biomarker
for the tumor may significantly change the standard-of-care. If a predictive biomarker was identified, this patient may be prioritized for
participating in a Molecularly Selected Population (MSP) trial, aiming to match the specific molecular aberration with a highly selective
MTA. Should this patient progress despite receiving all the standard options, the patient may still be suitable for participating in a Phase 0
(Ph0) study for altruism reasons, even if no efficacy was pursuit.

toxicity in preclinical animal studies, especially
changes in the repolarization based on druginduced inhibition of potassium channels
[55, 56]. If feasible, these studies are strongly
recommended to perform in HV, with far
less inter-subject variability and without
interference by any other adjacent comorbidity
or concomitant medication.
3.	 Bioavailability and bioequivalence studies
are developed in order to analyze the effect of
changes in the physiochemical properties of a
drug, like comparing different formulations
and dosage forms, or assessing bioequivalence
between several medicinal products containing
the same active substance [57]. As MTA are
complex molecules, the new ones may not be
identical although potentially “biosimilar” to
the marketed drugs [58].
4.	 Finally, classical dose-escalation FIH studies
in HV pretend to assess safety and tolerability
of a new MTA, considering escalating single
or multiple doses [59]. These types of studies
do not differ from Ph1 studies done in other
disciplines, such as in Endocrinology.
Some examples of MTA tested in each subtype of
HV studies are represented in Table 5. Remarkably, HV
studies imply a substantial change in patient populations in
EDD, since HV represent the opposite side of the spectrum
compared with the classical refractory cancer patients.

the intra-tumor heterogeinity. A coordination effort among
multiple academic centers seems mandatory to guarantee
a suitable patient identification and adequate accrual,
especially considering these small patient populations.
WOO studies in the neo-adjuvant setting will need to be
considered as one of the most suitable arenas for obtaining
more robust biomarker information. However, increasing
the recruitment in WOO, Ph0 and HV studies, with no
therapeutic intent at all, will certainly suppose a challenge
for the Oncologists, as they will need to provide a correct
comprehension of trial design and its objectives to the
patients, ensuring they understand the risks whilst dealing
with patient expectations. Physicians should keep in mind
that Ph1 trials still need to focus on finding the appropriate
dose that can be administered safely, with optimal efficacy
and minimal side effects. Even if most Ph1 focus on early
efficacy or biomarkers data nowadays, these should not
shadow the primary objective of delineating the safety
profile of new MTA, key for further development.
In conclusion, the particular toxicity profile of
MTA has broaden the therapeutic window of the anticancer agents, although there is still a long way to go, and
special caution will need to be taken when new therapeutic
options are tested in these new settings. All these studies
may represent a promising, fast and cost-effective method
for developing new compounds that can overcome the
traditional difficult processes for drug approval based on
expensive larger randomized trials. Oncology is one of the
fields with higher rates of failures at exceptionally high
economic costs, a fact that mandates a profound review
of the appropriate clinical trial design for regulatory
approval of new MTA. MSP, WOO, Ph0 and HV studies
may represent an optimal scenario for further progressing
in the development of new drugs, in a timely-effective
manner and reducing the economic burden for EDD field.

CONCLUSIONS
The advent of new MTA has broadened the EDD
landscape, not only in terms of expanding the portfolio
of drugs, but also in changing the candidates exposed to
these experimental therapies. It is clear that many different
patient populations other than advanced cancer patients
are currently exposed to MTA in their early development.
Figure 1. Proposes a potential journey of a cancer patient
through the conventional available therapies and their
sequence, in parallel to the different new clinical trial
designs currently available in EDD.
The appearance of these MTA has opened a field
of possibilities towards a second paradigm in EDD,
facing the physicians with the challenge of reconsidering
“the old paradigm” that only heavily pre-treated cancer
patients should be included in a FIH study. As MTA have
reshaped clinical trials, there is a rising need to revisit the
I/E criteria, considering that some of these criteria may be
disproportionately restrictive and should be tailored to the
potential risk/benefit for incurable cancer patients. Other
key points would be how to homogenize the molecular preselection criteria for participating into MSP studies and the
need of shortening the time of biomarker analysis, how to
obtain higher purity tumor samples and how to overcome
