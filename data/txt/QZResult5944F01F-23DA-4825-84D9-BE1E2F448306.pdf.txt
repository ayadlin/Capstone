ABSTRACT
Human 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 9 (AGPAT9) is the gene
identified from adipose tissue in 2007. We found AGPAT9 expression was significantly
higher in poorly invasive MCF7 human breast cancer cells than the highly invasive
MDA-MB-231 cells. AGPAT9 significantly inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer
cells in vitro and in vivo. Live-cell imaging and transwell assays showed that AGPAT9
could significantly inhibit the migration and invasive capacities of breast cancer cells.
The inhibitory effect of AGPAT9 on metastasis was also observed in vivo in lung
metastasis model. AGPAT9 inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation, migration and
invasion through, at least in part, suppressing the V-ATPase activity. In addition,
increased AGPAT9 expression in MCF-7/ADR cells could increase the chemosensitivity
to doxorubicin (Dox). Our findings suggest that increasing AGPAT9 expression may
be a new approach that can be used for breast cancer treatment.

overexpressed in many types of metastatic cancers and
positively correlated to their invasion and metastasis
[5]. In breast cancer cells, the abundance of V-ATPase
on the plasma membrane correlates with an invasive
phenotype [6]. Furthermore, V-ATPase inhibitors reduce
cell migration in cancer cells with high levels of plasma
membrane V-ATPase [7, 8]. There is evidence that the
inhibition of V-ATPase function via knockdown of
ATP6V0C (ATPase, H+ transporting, lysosomal 16kDa,
V0 subunit c) expression could effectively suppress cancer
metastasis by the decrease of proton extrusion and the
down-regulation of protease activity [9].
LASS2 (Homo sapiens longevity assurance
homolog 2 of yeast LAG1), which is also called CERS2
(Ceramide synthase 2), is the gene identified from a
human liver cDNA library and binds to ATP6V0C
[10]. Our previous studies have shown that LASS2 was
involved in chemotherapeutic outcomes and low LASS2
expression may predict chemoresistance [11]. In addition,
we also found higher expression of LASS2 in the breast

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in
women and the second-leading cause of cancer-related
deaths [1]. Breast cancer progression depends not only on
primary tumor growth but also on the ability of tumor cells
to metastasize to distant sites.
The vacuolar-H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) is an important
pH regulatory complex in tumor cells and positively
correlated to cancer invasion and metastasis, it is required
to mediate signaling pathways, such as the Wnt/β-catenin
pathway [2, 3]. V-ATPase uses the energy produced by
ATP hydrolysis to pump protons into the extracellular
environment. The low pH of tumor extracellular
microenvironment may induce the increased activation of
degradative enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs). Moreover, low extracellular pH may promote the
degradation and remolding of extracellular matrix (ECM)
through proteolytic enzyme activation, thus contributing
to cancer invasion and metastasis [4, 5]. V-ATPases are

cancer patients was associated with fewer lymph node
metastases [12].
KLF4 (Kruppel-like factor 4), which is also called
EZF (Epithelial zinc f﻿inger protein), is a transcription
factor that participates in both tumor suppression and
oncogenesis [13]. Transient adenoviral expression of
KLF4 in the 4T1 orthotopic mammary cancer model
significantly attenuated primary tumor growth as
well as micrometastases to the lungs and liver [14].
Overexpression of KLF4 in the highly metastatic MDAMB-231 breast tumor cell line was sufficient to restore
E-cadherin expression and suppress migration and
invasion [15]. Knockdown of KLF4 in MCF7 cells
elevated the growth rate of these cells in the presence of
estrogen [13].
AGPAT9
(1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate
O-acy
ltransferase 9), which is also called LPCAT1
(lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1) [16–18], is
a key enzyme for catalyzing the conversion of glycerol3-phosphate to lysophosphatidic acid in the synthesis of
triacylglycerol [19]. Until recently, AGPAT9 was cloned
from adipose tissue. AGPAT9 is highly expressed in the
lung and spleen, followed by leukocyte, omental adipose
tissue, and placenta [20]. AGPAT9 has physiological roles
in non-inflammatory platelet-activation factor remodeling
pathway [21] and in retinal photoreceptor homeostasis
[22]. Only recently, some researchers suggested that
AGPAT9 maybe correlate with cancer risk [23, 24]. In this
study, we found that AGPAT9 expression was markedly
different between MCF7 (poorly invasive breast cancer
cells) and MDA-MB-231 (highly invasive breast cancer
cells). We further elucidated the molecular mechanism
of AGPAT9 involved in breast cancer progression by the
in-vitro assays and the in-vivo experiments.

Expression analysis of AGPAT9 in breast cancer
cells
To elucidate the role of AGPAT9 in breast cancer,
we first examined the mRNA (Figure 1A) and protein
(Figure 1B) expression of AGPAT9 in breast cancer cell
lines. AGPAT9 was heterogeneously expressed in various
breast cancer cells. MCF7 cells expressed relatively
higher levels of AGPAT9 protein than other cells, and
MDA-MB-231 cells expressed relatively lower levels of
AGPAT9 protein (Figure 1C). To determine if there is a
correlation between AGPAT9 protein levels and invasive
abilities in breast cancer cell lines, we then examined
the invasive ability of these cell lines using the RTCA
xCELLigence system. Results showed that MCF7 cells
are poorly invasive, and MDA-MB-231 cells are highly
invasive (Figure 1D and 1E). These results are consistent
with other reports [25, 26]. Intriguingly, across all cell
lines tested, we found a significant inverse correlation
between AGPAT9 protein levels and invasive abilities (P
= 0.032; Figure 1F). We chose the relatively AGPAT9highly-expressed cell line MCF7 (poorly invasive breast
cancer cells) and the relatively AGPAT9-lowly-expressed
cell line MDA-MB-231 (highly invasive breast cancer
cells) for functional investigation.

Effect of AGPAT9 on in-vitro proliferation
We established stable cell lines transduced by a
lentivirus carrying the AGPAT9 gene or no insert (vector
control), which were designated as Lenti-AGPAT9 and
Lenti-vector, respectively, in the breast cancer cell line

MDA-MB-231 (Figure 2A and 2B). We also established
stable cell lines transduced by a lentivirus carrying AGPAT9short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or vector control, which was
designated as Lenti-shRNA-AGPAT9 and Lenti-shRNAvector, respectively, in the breast cancer cell line MCF7 (Figure 2C and 2D). In the CCK-8 cell proliferation
assay, overexpression of AGPAT9 in MDA-MB-231 cells
significantly inhibited cell proliferation with 48 h (P =
0.0009; Figure 2E), and AGPAT9 knock-down in MCF-7
cells significantly increased cell proliferation with 48 h (P =
0.0094; Figure 2F). Furthermore, we used the xCELLigence
system to analyze cell proliferation in real time (Figure
2G). Results showed overexpression of AGPAT9 in MDAMB-231 cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation with
48 h (P < 0.0001; Figure 2H), and AGPAT9 knock-down in
MCF-7 cells significantly increased cell proliferation with
48 h (P = 0.0074; Figure 2H). These are similar to the results
of CCK-8 assay. Moreover, colony formation assay showed
that enforced expression of AGPAT9 resulted in a significant
decrease in colony numbers in MDA-MB-231 cells
compared with the vector controls, and reduced expression of
AGPAT9 resulted in a significant increase in colony numbers
in MCF7 cells compared to control (Figure 2I).

with vector groups (P = 0.0095; Figure 3A and 3B),
and AGPAT9 knockdown in MCF7 cells significantly
increased the migration capacity (P = 0.0093; Figure
3A and 3B). Transwell assays with Matrigel (Catalog
Number: 356234, Protein Concentration: 8.95 mg/ml,
BD Biosciences, MA) showed that overexpression of
AGPAT9 could significantly inhibit the invasive capacity
of MDA-MB-231 cells when compared with the control
cells (P = 0.0418; Figure 3C and 3D), and AGPAT9
knockdown in MCF7 cells significantly increased the
invasion capacity (P = 0.0133; Figure 3C and 3D).
Furthermore, we used the xCELLigence system to
analyze cell migration and invasion in real time. Results
showed overexpression of AGPAT9 in MDA-MB-231
cells significantly inhibited cell migration with 24 h
(P = 0.0013; Figure 3E and 3F), and AGPAT9 knock-down
in MCF-7 cells significantly increased cell migration with
24 h (P = 0.0278; Figure 3E and 3F). The results also
showed overexpression of AGPAT9 in MDA-MB-231 cells
significantly inhibited cell invasion with 48 h (P = 0.0406;
Figure 3G and 3H), and AGPAT9 knock-down in MCF-7
cells significantly increased cell invasion with 48 h (P =
0.0272; Figure 3G and 3H). These are similar to the results
of Transwell assay. To further confirm this observation,
we also determined the migration ability of breast cancer
cells in the condition of AGPAT9 overexpression using a
confocal scanner system. The results showed that AGPAT9
significantly decreased the migration of MDA-MB-231
cells compared with the vector groups (Figure 3I and 3J;
Supplementary Movies S1–S4).

the expression of LASS2 is transcriptionally activated by
KLF4 and LASS2 is a target gene of KLF4 (Figure 4D
and 4E). Intriguingly, RTCA proliferation assay showed
that reduced expression of LASS2 in Lenti-AGPAT9
(MDA-MB-231) cells could significantly increase cell
proliferation compared with the Lenti-AGPAT9 (MDAMB-231) cells (P = 0.0024; Figure 4F and 4G), and
enforced expression of LASS2 in Lenti-shRNA-AGPAT9
(MCF7) cells could significantly inhibit cell proliferation
compared with the Lenti-shRNA-AGPAT9 (MCF7) cells
(P = 0.0175; Figure 4F and 4G). Furthermore, RTCA
migration assay showed that reduced expression of LASS2
in Lenti-AGPAT9 cells could significantly increase
cell migration compared with the Lenti-AGPAT9 cells
(P = 0.03; Figure 4H and 4I), and enforced expression of
LASS2 in Lenti-shRNA-AGPAT9 cells could significantly
inhibit cell migration compared with the Lenti-shRNAAGPAT9 cells (P = 0.0351; Figure 4H and 4I). In addition,
RTCA invasion assay showed that reduced expression
of LASS2 in Lenti-AGPAT9 cells could significantly
increase cell invasion compared with the Lenti-AGPAT9
cells (P = 0.0189; Figure 4J and 4K), and enforced
expression of LASS2 in Lenti-shRNA-AGPAT9 cells
could significantly inhibit cell invasion compared with
the Lenti-shRNA-AGPAT9 cells (P = 0.0016; Figure 4J
and 4K). Collectively, these data suggest that AGPAT9
inhibits breast cancer proliferation, migration and invasion
through, at least in part, up-regulating the mRNA and
protein levels of LASS2.

recovery from intracellular acidification induced by
NH4Cl prepulse is shown in Figure 5D–5E. When exposed
to NH4Cl, pHi increased rapidly and then decreased
gradually. After the removal of NH4Cl, pHi dropped
rapidly. In the following procedure, the pHi of Lenti-vector
cells recovered (Figure 5D), whereas it hardly recovered
in Lenti-AGPAT9 cells (Figure 5E). The results indicate
that overexpression of AGPAT9 results in inhibition of
pHi recovery due to AGPAT9 suppressing the function of
V-ATPase in Lenti-AGPAT9 cells.

Effect of AGPAT9 on the MMP-2 activity, MMP9 activity and Wnt/β-catenin pathway
The supernatant of cultured cells was collected
and the activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were assayed
with MMP-2/MMP-9 Activity Assay kit. Intriguingly,
overexpression of AGPAT9 in the MDA-MB-231
cells could significantly decrease the active MMP-2
level in the supernatant of cultured cells (P = 0.0111;
Figure 5F). Knockdown of AGPAT9 in the MCF7 cells
could significantly increase the active MMP-2 level in
the supernatant of cultured cells (P = 0.0097; Figure 5F).
Our results also showed overexpression of AGPAT9 in
the MDA-MB-231 cells could significantly decrease the
active MMP-9 level in the supernatant of cultured cells
(P = 0.0202; Figure 5G). Knockdown of AGPAT9 in the
MCF7 cells could significantly increase the active MMP9 level in the supernatant of cultured cells (P = 0.0027;
Figure 5G). These results showed that AGPAT9 have
significant effects on the active MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels
in the supernatant.
The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is one of the most
important signal transduction pathways in breast cancer
cell growth. The accumulation of β-catenin in the cells,
especially in the nucleus, is considered as an important
indicator of the activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway [28].
Our results showed that reduced expression of AGPAT9 in
MCF7 cells could result in an obvious increase in β-catenin
protein level in both nucleus and cytoplasm compared to
control (Figure 5H). Furthermore, expression of Wnt/βcatenin pathway target genes, c-Myc, Cyclin D1, Axin-2
and CD44 were significantly increased in the Lenti-shRNAAGPAT9 (MCF7) cells when compared with control cells
(Figure 5I). Collectively, these data suggest that AGPAT9
influences breast cancer proliferation through, at least in
part, regulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Figure 5J).

Effect of AGPAT9 on the V-ATPase activity, pHe
and pHi
In this study, we found that AGPAT9 could
significantly increase the mRNA and protein levels of
LASS2. In previous study, we reported that LASS2 could
inhibit the activity of V-ATPase proton pump through
binding to ATP6V0C, the subunit of V-ATPase proton
pump [11, 27]. Therefore, we examined the influence of
AGPAT9 on the V-ATPase activity. Overexpression of
AGPAT9 in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly reduced the
V-ATPase activity (P = 0.0351; Figure 5A), and AGPAT9
knockdown in MCF7 cells significantly increased the
V-ATPase activity (P = 0.0496; Figure 5A).
V-ATPases are involved in maintaining a relatively
neutral intracellular pH and an acidic extracellular pH,
through pumping protons into extracellular environment
[11]. In this study, the process of proton extrusion was
investigated by detecting the proton concentration
in the medium with pH-sensitive BCECF. As shown
in Figure 5B, the proton secretion of Lenti-AGPAT9
(MDA-MB-231) was notably reduced at 9 h compared
with that of Lenti-vector (MDA-MB-231) (P = 0.0136;
Figure 5B). Furthermore, the proton secretion of LentishRNA-AGPAT9 (MCF7) was significantly increased
compared with that of Lenti-shRNA-vector (MCF7) cells
(P = 0.0414; Figure 5C). The pHi (intracellular pH)

To determine the in vivo effects of AGPAT9, we
performed in vivo proliferation and metastasis study. The

heavier than those of the control group (P = 0.0293 and

in Lenti-AGPAT9 cells. Active MMP-2 F. and active MMP-9 G. levels in culture supernatants were measured using the enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Reduced expression of AGPAT9 in MCF7 cells could result in an obvious increase in β-catenin protein level
in both nucleus and cytoplasm compared to control H. The expression of Wnt/β-catenin pathway target genes, c-Myc, Cyclin D1, Axin-2 and

Effect of AGPAT9 on chemosensitivity

we injected Lenti-vector (MDA-MB-231) or LentiAGPAT9 (MDA-MB-231) cells into the lateral tail veins
of nude mice (n = 10) and evaluated the metastatic growth
of cells in the lung. After 100 days, the Lenti-AGPAT9
mice displayed a statistically significantly lower number of
lung metastases than the control group mice (P = 0.0004;
Figure 6E and 6F), indicative of extravasation and tumor
growth in the lung. When lungs underwent hematoxylin
and eosin staining, lung metastases were observed in all
ten mice intravenously injected Lenti-vector cells (Figure
6E, up), whereas much less lung metastases were observed
in the mice intravenously injected Lenti-AGPAT9 cells
(Figure 6E, down).

We found that the AGPAT9 was significantly decreased
at mRNA level (–240.368-fold, P = 0.0006, Supplementary
Figure S1A) in the drug-resistant breast cancer cell line MCF7/
ADR than in the drug-sensitive breast cancer cell line MCF7.
Next, we established stable cell lines transduced by a lentivirus
carrying the AGPAT9 gene or no insert (vector control) in the
MCF7/ADR cells. Overexpression of AGPAT9 in MCF7/
ADR cells significantly reduced the IC50 value for Dox (P
= 0.0146; Supplementary Figure S1B). To investigate the
influence of AGPAT9 on the subcellular distribution of Dox in
the cells, AGPAT9-overexpressing cells and control cells were

treated with Dox (Supplementary Figure S1C). After uptake
by MCF7 cells, Dox was localized mostly in the nuclei, which
is in line with the sensitivity of these cells to the cytotoxic
effect of Dox. In contrast, Dox was localized in discrete
granules in the cytosol and barely detectable in the nuclei of
control and Lenti-vector (MCF7/ADR) cells. However, in
Lenti-AGPAT9 (MCF7/ADR) cells, Dox was localized in
the nuclei, as assayed by confocal fluorescence microscopy.
These results indicate that enforced expression of AGPAT9 in
MCF7/ADR cells results in a clear nuclear targeting of Dox.
In addition, we also determined the migration ability of breast
cancer cells in the condition of AGPAT9 overexpression using
a confocal scanner system. The results showed that AGPAT9
significantly decreased the migration of MCF7/ADR cells
compared with the vector groups (Supplementary Figure S2;
Supplementary Movies S5 and S6).

inverse correlation between AGPAT9 protein levels and
invasive abilities (P = 0.032; Figure 1F). The in-vitro data
showed overexpression of AGPAT9 in MDA-MB-231 cells
significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration and
invasion (Figures 2 and 3). The in-vitro data also showed
AGPAT9 knock-down in MCF7 cells significantly increased
cell proliferation, migration and invasion (Figures 2 and 3).
Similar results were obtained in in-vivo experiments
(Figure 6). Furthermore, overexpression of AGPAT9 in
Bcap-37 cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation,
migration and invasion, and AGPAT9 knockdown in
Bcap-37 cells significantly increased cell proliferation,
migration and invasion (Supplementary Figure S3).
KLF4 inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation,
migration and invasion [13, 15]. We found that enforced
expression of AGPAT9 resulted in a significant increase in
KLF4 mRNA level, and reduced expression of AGPAT9
resulted in a significant decrease in KLF4 mRNA level.
Similar results were obtained by western blot analysis.
Further study is underway to explore the mechanism that
AGPAT9 increases expression of KLF4. Our previous study
indicated that LASS2 inhibited cancer cell proliferation,
migration and invasion [11, 27]. Furthermore, we found
that the expression of LASS2 is transcriptionally activated
by KLF4 and LASS2 is a target gene of KLF4. In previous
study, we reported that LASS2 could inhibit the V-ATPase
activity through binding to ATP6V0C, the c subunit of
V-ATPase proton pump [11, 27]. Furthermore, we found
that inhibition of V-ATPase activity by knocking down
ATP6V0C expression in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly
reduced the migration (Supplementary Figure S4;
Supplementary Movies S7 and S8). These results suggest
that AGPAT9 may inhibit malignant progression of

DISCUSSION
Evidences are accumulating that acidic tumor
microenvironment is involved in cancer progression [29,
30]. The V-ATPase is the primary regulator of the tumor
microenvironment, by means of proton extrusion to the
extracellular medium. Several V-ATPase inhibitors have
been reported to inhibit cancer cell proliferation, invasion
and metastasis [8, 31].
In this study, we found that the mRNA level of
AGPAT9 in MDA-MB-231 cells (highly invasive breast
cancer cells) was significantly lower than in MCF7 cells
(poorly invasive breast cancer cells) (–8.06-fold; Figure 1A).
Furthermore, we confirmed this differential expression at the
protein level (–11.24-fold; Figure 1B and 1C). Intriguingly,
across all breast cancer cell lines tested, we found a significant

breast cancer by inhibiting the V-ATPase activity through
increasing the LASS2 expression. To explore this possibility,
we examined the influence of AGPAT9 on the V-ATPase
activity, pHe and pHi in the breast cancers. The results
showed that overexpression of AGPAT9 could reduce the
V-ATPase activity (Figure 5A), increase the pHe (Figure 5B)
and decrease the pHi (Figure 5D and 5E) in MDA-MB-231
cells. Meanwhile, AGPAT9 knockdown in MCF7 cells
significantly increased the V-ATPase activity (Figure 5A).
The promoting effect of V-ATPase on cancer
invasion mainly relies on its maintain acidic pH of
extracellular microenvironment, which is related to the
activation of many proteases involved in the digestion of
ECM [9]. The pH-sensitive proteases include cathepsin
(cathepsin B, D, etc.) and MMPs (MMP-2, MMP-9,
MMP-3, etc.) [9, 32]. Intriguingly, AGPAT9 overexpression
in invasive MDA-MB-231 cells is associated with
decreased activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9, whereas
suppression of AGPAT9 had the opposite effects on MMPs
in non-invasive MCF7 cells (Figure 5F and 5G). AGPAT9
inhibits breast cancer invasion through, at least in part, upregulating the activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Figure
5F and 5G). Very recently, some researchers found that
V-ATPase was required to mediate Wnt/β-catenin signaling
[2, 33, 34]. Wnt/β-catenin signaling is important for cell
proliferation. Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
stimulates cell growth. V-ATPase generates a proton
gradient that is essential for LRP6 phosphorylation and
hence β-catenin activation [2]. AGPAT9 inhibits breast
cancer proliferation through, at least in part, regulating the
Wnt/β-catenin pathway (Figure 5H and 5I).

Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) belongs to the family of
anthracyclines. It is membrane permeable in its neutral
form and relatively membrane impermeable when
protonated [35]. Therefore, the acid pHe of cancer cells can
make Dox become protonated and hinder it from entering
the cells [36]. Chemotherapeutic agents are distributed
throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus of drug-sensitive
cells. In contrast, in MDR cells, they accumulate only
within discrete cytoplasmic organelles, and almost none is
detectable in the nucleus, the target of anthracycline drugs
[37, 38]. We found that the overexpression of AGPAT9
increased the susceptibility to Dox cytotoxicity in MCF7/
ADR cells. This effect might be caused by a significant
increase in pHe, and more Dox entered the cells and stayed
in the nuclei of cell (Supplementary Figure S1C).
In summary, we first delineate the molecular me­
chanism that AGPAT9 inhibits human breast cancer cells
proliferation, invasion and metastasis (Figure 7). Our
findings suggest that increasing AGPAT9 expression may
be a new approach that can be used for breast cancer
treatment and imply that acidic tumor microenvironment
may be considered as an important influential factor of
antitumor therapeutic efficacy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
Human breast cancer cell lines, T-47D, SK-BR-3,
MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-231 and
MCF7, were purchased from the American Type Culture

Figure 7: Effect of AGPAT9 on the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. A hypothetical cascade pathway of the suppression of tumor

cell invasion and proliferation by AGPAT9. AGPAT9 could significantly inhibit the V-ATPase activity and extracellular hydrogen ion
concentration, and in turn the activation of secreted MMP-2/MMP-9, which ultimately suppressed tumor’s invasion. AGPAT9 inhibited
breast cancer proliferation through, at least in part, suppressing the V-ATPase activity and Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

Protein extraction and western blotting

Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Human breast cancer
cell line Bcap-37 was purchased from the Committee on
Type Culture Collection of Chinese Academy of Sciences
(Shanghai, China).

Total protein was extracted from the homogenate
of cells using the T-PER Tissue Protein Extraction
Reagent (Thermo Scientific, #78510). The proteins were
separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose
membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The membrane
was blocked with 5% non-fat milk and incubated with
rabbit anti-AGPAT9 polyclonal antibody (pAb) (Sigma
Aldrich) (1:1000), rabbit anti-KLF4 pAb (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) (1:1000), rabbit anti-LASS2 pAb (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) (1:1000), rabbit anti-β-catenin
monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Cell Signaling Technology)
(1:1000), rabbit anti-Histone H3 pAb (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) (1:1000), rabbit anti-c-Myc mAb (Cell
Signaling Technology) (1:1000), rabbit anti-Cyclin D1
mAb (Cell Signaling Technology) (1:1000), rabbit antiAxin-2 mAb (Cell Signaling Technology) (1:1000) or
mouse anti-CD44 mAb (Cell Signaling Technology)
(1:1000). The proteins were detected with enhanced
chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce).

Vector constructs and lentivirus production
The AGPAT9 lentivirus expression vector was
constructed by amplifying the coding sequence of
human AGPAT9 and cloning it into the LV5/GFP/Puro
(Genepharma, Shanghai, China) or LV6/Puro vector
(Genepharma, Shanghai, China). Oligonucleotides were
synthesized to generate an annealing shRNA targeting
the sequence of AGPAT9 from position 606–626
(5′-GGGAACTCTGATCCAGTATA T-3′), 709–729
(5′-GGAAAGTGGCCACAGATAATG-3′),
758–778
(5′-GGACCT GCCTAATTACCTTCA-3′) or from 1204–
1224 (5′-GGAGGAGAGAAGATAGGT ATT-3′). The
fragments were cloned separately into pGLV3/H1/GFP/
Puro vector (Genepharma, Shanghai, China) using the
restriction sites BamHI and EcoRI.
The LASS2 lentivirus expression and shRNAexpressing vector were detailed in our previous study [11].
The other plasmids or recombinant vectors used are shown
in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.

Xenograft model and treatments
Two different mouse models were used to observe
in vivo effect of AGPAT9 on breast cancer cells. For the
subcutaneous model, 17β-estradiol pellets (NE-121,
Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL) were
subcutaneously implanted into the left shoulder area
of mice 3 days before tumor cell injection. MCF7 cells
(1 × 107) with stable knockdown of AGPAT9 or the control
vector were suspended in 200 μl serum-free DMEM and
subcutaneously injected into the right upper ﬂank of each
mouse (ten per group, female BALB/c-nu/nu, 8 weeks
old) [39, 40]. At day 11 after cell injection, mice were
allocated to the Lenti-shRNA-vector group and LentishRNA-AGPAT9 group. The tumors were measured
using digital calipers every 3 to 4 days after they reached
a volume of 100 mm3, and tumor volumes were calculated
as described: V (cm3) = Width2 (cm2) × Length (cm) / 2. At
the termination of the experiment, the mice were sacrificed
by cervical dislocation, and the tumors were weighed
immediately after dissection.
For lung metastasis experiments, MDA-MB-231 (1.5
× 106) stably expressing AGPAT9 or the control vector were
suspended in 200 μl PBS and injected into the tail veins
of each mouse (female BALB/c-nu/nu, 8 weeks old) [41].
Then, the animals were equally divided into two groups
(ten per group): Lenti-vector group and Lenti- AGPAT9
group. At day 100 after cell injection, the mice were
sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and their lungs were
removed and subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
staining. Mice were manipulated and housed according to
the protocols approved by the Committee on the Ethics of
Animal Experiments of Jiangsu Normal University.

Quantitative real-time PCR
Real-time PCR analyses were performed
with SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa). The
sequences of primers used were as follows:
AGPAT9: 5′-CACCGTGACCGACCTATTC-3′ and
5′-GCCCAGCGTCTGAGTTTT-3′; LASS2: 5′-GCCCAAGCAGGTGGAAGTAGAG-3′ and 5′-CCAGGGTTTA-TCCACAATGACG-3′.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
The assay was performed using the EZ-ChIPTM
kit (#17–371, Millipore, Billerica, MA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The following antibodies
were utilized to immunoprecipitate crosslinked proteinDNA complexes: rabbit anti-KLF4 (sc-20691, Santa
Cruz) and normal rabbit IgG (12–370, Millipore). The
immunoprecipitated DNA was purified for PCR analyses
with primers within the promoter of LASS2.

Activity of V-ATPase
Assays were performed as described previously by
us [11, 27].

Measurement of extracellular pH and
intracellular pH
Assays were performed as described previously by
us [11, 27].
