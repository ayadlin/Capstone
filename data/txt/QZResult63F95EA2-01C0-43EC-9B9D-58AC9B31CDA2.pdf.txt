Abstract
Wnt/b-catenin pathway activation caused by adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutations occurs in
approximately 80% of sporadic colorectal cancers (CRC). The antihelminth compound niclosamide downregulates components of the Wnt pathway, specifically Dishevelled-2 (Dvl2) expression, resulting in diminished
downstream b-catenin signaling. In this study, we determined whether niclosamide could inhibit the Wnt/
b-catenin pathway in human CRCs and whether its inhibition might elicit antitumor effects in the presence of
APC mutations. We found that niclosamide inhibited Wnt/b-catenin pathway activation, downregulated Dvl2,
decreased downstream b-catenin signaling, and exerted antiproliferative effects in human colon cancer cell lines
and CRC cells isolated by surgical resection of metastatic disease, regardless of mutations in APC. In contrast,
inhibition of NF-kB or mTOR did not exert similar antiproliferative effects in these CRC model systems. In mice
implanted with human CRC xenografts, orally administered niclosamide was well tolerated, achieved plasma
and tumor levels associated with biologic activity, and led to tumor control. Our findings support clinical
explorations to reposition niclosamide for the treatment of CRC. Cancer Res; 71(12); 4172–82. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Currently available systemic therapies increase survival but
do not cure advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). One explanation is the failure of these therapies to address the subset of
malignant cells with stem cell–like characteristics. The Wnt
signaling pathway, fundamental to embryonic tissue patterning, is also activated in stem-like cells (1–3). Binding of Wnt
ligands, of which there are 19 subtypes in humans, to Frizzled
(Fzd) receptors, of which there are at least 10 (4, 5), results in
the recruitment of intracellular Dishevelled (Dvl), leading to
Fzd receptor internalization (6). Downstream signaling events
include both the stabilization of cytosolic b-catenin and the
translocation of the stabilized b-catenin to the nucleus that
result in the activation of the transcription factor T-cell factor/
lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF; refs. 3, 7). In the absence
of pathway stimulation, a complex consisting of axin, GSK-3,

and adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) promotes the proteolytic degradation of b-catenin.
The canonical Wnt pathway is activated in approximately
80% of sporadic CRC primarily because of mutations in the
APC gene (8, 9) and in a small proportion of cases, activating
mutations of the b-catenin gene (CTNNB1; ref. 9). Although
one would expect that inhibition of the Wnt pathway would
require drugs that inhibit b-catenin or its downstream intermediaries, recent observations reveal that Wnt ligands or
inhibitors may affect the growth and survival of colon
cancer cells in spite of the presence of APC or CTNNB1
mutations (10–12). This suggests that inhibition of upstream
receptors, feasible drug targets compared with downstream
protein–protein interactions, may provide therapeutic benefit
in CRC (5, 13–16). We instituted a translational small molecule
screening program to identify agents that inhibit Wnt/Fzd
signaling. Using libraries containing Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, we discovered that the
antihelminthic niclosamide promotes Fzd1 endocytosis,
downregulates Dvl2 protein, and inhibits Wnt3A-stimulated
b-catenin stabilization and downstream b-catenin signaling
(TCF/LEF reporter activity). We noted that Fzd1 colocalizes
in vesicles containing transferrin and agonist-activated
b(2)-adrenergic receptor following niclosamide-mediated
internalization and could serve as a negative modulator of
Wnt/Fzd1 signaling by depleting Fzd and Dvl (17).
We now extend our previous studies by showing that
niclosamide inhibits Fzd1 signaling in human colon cancer
cell lines and in human colorectal metastasectomy specimens.
We found that niclosamide was well tolerated in experimental

of APC (NCBI accession: NG_008481) or b-catenin gene
(NCBI accession: NG_013302).

Materials and Methods
Reagents
The following reagents were purchased for this study:
niclosamide, protease inhibitors (P8340), phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride (P7626), orthovanadate (220590), and the IkB
kinase (IKK) inhibitor PS-1145 (P6624; Sigma-Aldrich); 7-aminoactinomycin D and Annexin V–biotin kits (Immunotech);
TNF-a (R&D Systems); mTOR inhibitor everolimus (Novartis);
and oxaliplatin (Sanofi Aventis).
Mice
NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J [nonobese diabetic (NOD)/severe
combined immunodeficient (SCID)] mice were purchased
from Jackson Labs and bred in the Duke Comprehensive
Cancer Center Isolation Facility. All work was conducted
under a Duke University IACUC–approved protocol.
Cell lines
CRC cell lines, HT29 (ATCC HTB-38), HCT116 (ATCC
CCL-247), CaCO2 (ATCC HTB-37), and MCF-10A (ATCC
CRL-10317) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). ATCC characterizes these cells by
morphology, immunology, DNA fingerprint, and cytogenetics. HT29 and CaCO2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's
modified Eagle's medium, and HCT116 cells were cultured
in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% FBS. MCF10A cells were cultured in mammary epithelial basal
medium with 5% horse serum and mammary epithelial
growth medium growth factors (Lonza). All cultures were
monitored routinely and found to be free of contamination
by mycoplasma or fungi. All cell lines were discarded after
4 months and new lines were propagated from frozen
stocks.
Tumor cell isolation from patients' CRC specimens and
establishment of explants in NOD/SCID mice
Patients undergoing resection of CRC metastatic to the
liver provided signed informed consent approved by the
Duke University Medical Center Institutional Review Board
to allow harvest of tumor remaining viable despite prior
systemic chemotherapy. CRC cells were isolated from metastatic specimens as previously described (18), and CRC cells
growing in vitro were used as target cells in subsequent
assays.
APC and b-catenin mutation analyses
Genomic DNA was prepared from CRC explants growing
in NOD/SCID mice by using standard methods. Hematoxylin
and eosin staining was initially carried out on the CRC
explants and areas of malignant epithelial cells were macrodissected. Genomic DNA was isolated and used to PCR
amplify the DNA fragments of mutation hotspot of APC
(19) or b-catenin gene (20). PCR fragments were agarose gel
purified and subjected to DNA sequencing. The sequences

MTT assay
CRC cell lines (HT29, HCT116, and CaCO2) and CRC explant
cells growing in vitro (CRC007, CRC010, CRC020, CRC025,
CRC028, CRC039, CRC057, and CRC119) were put into 96-well
flat-bottomed plates at 5,000 and 10,000 cells/well, respectively. Niclosamide (0.4, 2, and 10 mmol/L) was added and
further incubated for 3 days. Oxaliplatin (10 mmol/L) was
added to control wells for comparison purposes. MTT assay
was conducted as described elsewhere (18). To examine the
overtime effect of niclosamide, cells were incubated with
niclosamide (0.4, 2, and 10 mmol/L) for 24, 48, 72, and 96
hours, and MTT assays were conducted at each time point. To
examine the involvement of mTOR and NF-kB signaling in the
cytotoxic effect of niclosamide on CRC cells, everolimus (0.1,
0.3, 1, 3, and 9 mmol/L; ref. 21) or PS-1145 (0.4, 2, 10, and 50
mmol/L; ref. 22) was added to the medium and MTT assays
were conducted after 72-hours of incubation.
Flow-based apoptosis assay
Colon cancer cell lines and explants (1  105 tumor cells),
normal mammary epithelial cells (MCF-10A), fibroblasts, and
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from
normal donors were cultured in 12-well flat-bottomed plates
with niclosamide (0.2–20 mmol/L) for 3 days. All cells were
harvested with 0.05% trypsin/EDTA, washed, labeled with
biotin-conjugated Annexin V, and then stained with 7-AAD
and streptavidin-APC. Samples were acquired on a FACSCalibur machine (BD Bioscience) and analyzed with CellQuest
software for expression of Annexin V as a marker of apoptosis.
Luciferase reporter assay
Cancer cells (CaCO2 and HCT116) were seeded in a 96-well
plate and cotransfected with 30 ng/well TOPflash or FOPflash
plasmid DNA with 3 ng/well pRL-TK Renilla luciferase plasmid DNA (Promega) by using Lipofectamine LTX plus (Invitrogen). TOPflash and FOPflash were obtained from Dr. Randy
Moon at University of Washington. Sixteen hours after transfection, cells were treated with DMSO or niclosamide at
several concentrations and further incubated for 24 hours.
Luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Luciferase
Reporter Assay System (Promega). The firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity.
Western blot analysis
Cytosolic fractions of lysates were isolated as described
elsewhere (23). Anti-Dvl2 (clone 10B5), anti-b-catenin (clone
7D11), and anti-b-actin (clone C-11) monoclonal antibodies
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used to probe the blots. To
examine the NF-kB activation status of niclosamide-treated
cancer cells, HT29, HCT116, and CaCO2 cell lines were treated
with/without niclosamide (1 mmol/L) or PS-1145 (10 mmol/L)
for 24 hours and then with/without TNF-a (10 ng/mL) for 1
hour. Whole-cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting
with anti-phospho-NF-kB p65 (clone 93H1; Cell Signaling

Technology) and anti-NF-kB p65 (clone F-6, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) antibodies.
Immunohistochemistry and fluorescent
immunostaining
Tumors grown in the flank of NOD/SCID mice, treated
with/without niclosamide, were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (24). Anti-b-catenin (clone 7D11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-Dvl2 (clone 10B5; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) monoclonal antibodies were used at 1:100
and 1:50 dilution, respectively. An Olympus Vanox AHBS3
microscope (Olympus) was used for the analyses and photographs were taken with an Olympus DP-70 camera. To analyze
the effect of niclosamide on NF-kB signaling, cancer cell lines
(HT29, HCT116, and CaCO2) were incubated with/without
niclosamide (1 mmol/L) or PS-1145 (10 mmol/L) for 24 hours
and then with/without TNF-a (10 ng/mL) for 1 hour. Cells
were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (Sigma), permeabilized
with 0.01% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS, and then incubated
with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-NF-kB
p65 antibody (clone F-6, 1:100 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 hour at room temperature. Nuclei were labeled
with DAPI (40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). An Axio Observer
fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss) was used, and images
were captured on a Hamamatsu ORCA ER CCD camera
(Hamamatsu Photonics) and analyzed with MetaMorph Premier 7.6.5 software (Molecular Devices). Additional methodologies are provided in the Supplementary sections.
Pharmacokinetics of niclosamide in plasma and tumor
NOD/SCID mice (weighting 23–25 g) received oral administration of niclosamide (200 mg/kg of body weight). Blood
samples were obtained at predose and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 4,
8, 12, and 24 hours after drug administration. Plasma was
isolated by centrifugation and stored at 20  C until liquid
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric (LC/MS-MS)
analysis.
To study tumor uptake of niclosamide, NOD/SCID mice
were inoculated with HCT116 cells (5  106 cells), and on day
4, oral gavage of niclosamide (200 mg/kg body weight) or
control solvent was initiated. After 3 weeks of treatment, mice
were sacrificed 24 hours after the last drug administration,
and blood and tumor tissue were collected simultaneously.
Tumor tissue was cryocrushed in liquid nitrogen and homogenized with deionized water in the FastPrep apparatus (4mm ceramic bead, 20 seconds, speed 4). Quantification of
niclosamide in mouse plasma and tumor tissue was guided by
a published LC/MS-MS method (25). A Shimadzu 20A series
LC system and an Applied Biosystems API 4000 QTrap tandem
mass spectrometer were used.
In vivo antitumor effect of niclosamide
HCT116 cells were harvested from flasks with 0.05% trypsin/EDTA and resuspended with Hank's buffered solution (5 
106 cells/100 mL). CRC explants (CRC039) cultured in vitro
were harvested with the same procedure and mixed with equal
volume of Matrigel to make 1  106 cells/100 mL concentration. The cell suspensions (100 mL) were inoculated into the

4174

flanks of NOD/SCID mice. Four days later, niclosamide administration by gavage 6 d/wk for 2 (HCT116) or 3 weeks (CRC039)
began. Tumor size was measured 3 times a week until mice
were euthanized.
Statistical analysis
Student's t test was used to analyze differences in tumor
volumes for each niclosamide concentration compared to
vehicle control. Differences at P < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.

Results
Niclosamide inhibits proliferation of CRC cell lines and
explants
The CRC cell lines used in this study, HT29 and CaCO2
(APCmut and b-cateninwt) and HCT116 (APCwt and b-cateninmut), all express Fzd1 and Fzd2. These cell lines were
incubated for 3 days with various concentrations of niclosamide (0.4–10 mmol/L) or 10 mmol/L of oxaliplatin, prior to
analysis in an MTT assay. Niclosamide inhibited proliferation
of all 3 cell lines with HCT116, most sensitive, and HT29, least
sensitive (Fig. 1A). The antiproliferative effect of niclosamide,
as low as 2 mmol/L concentration, was greater than 10 mmol/L
oxaliplatin against HCT116 and CaCO2 cells. The antiproliferative effect of niclosamide against cultured CRC explants
derived from resection specimens (CRC007, CRC010, CRC020,
CRC025, CRC028, CRC039, CRC057, and CRC119) was similarly
studied in MTT assays after 3-day incubation with various
concentrations of niclosamide. The mutational status of the
APC and b-catenin genes for these CRC explants is reported in
Table 1. Niclosamide inhibited proliferation of all CRC
explants tested in a dose-dependent fashion regardless of
whether there were APC/b-catenin mutations. Although there
was a trend for greater inhibition of proliferation of explants
without mutations at low concentrations of niclosamide (0.4
and 2.0 mmol/L), there was equivalent inhibition of proliferation (of explants with and without APC/b-catenin mutations)
at higher doses (Table 1; representative cases shown in Figure
1B). These data suggest that niclosamide has anticancer
activity despite mutations in the downstream tumor suppressor APC.
To assess the effect of niclosamide on CRCs over time, the 3
cell lines were incubated with various concentrations of
niclosamide or oxaliplatin for 24, 48, 72, or 96 hours. As shown
in Figure 1C, in general, the antiproliferative effect increased
over time.
Niclosamide is nontoxic to normal fibroblasts and
PBMCs
To assess the toxicity of niclosamide on nonmalignant
tissues, PBMCs from a normal donor, fibroblasts isolated from
CRC patient's tumor tissue, and mammary epithelial cells
(MCF-10A) were compared with the colorectal explants for
their sensitivity to niclosamide by using an Annexin V–based
flow cytometric assay (Fig. 1D). CRC explants and HCT116
cells showed steep increases in Annexin V–positive cells at 1
or 0.2 mmol/L of niclosamide, respectively, reaching 60% to

80%, suggesting a significant induction of apoptotic cell death.
However, fibroblasts, MCF-10A cells, or PBMCs from a normal
donor did not show a significant increase in apoptotic cell
death. Thus, niclosamide does not have significant toxicity
against nontumor cells.

CRC cells not affected by NF-kB or mTOR inhibitors are
inhibited by niclosamide under conditions in which it
inhibits Wnt pathway signaling
Others have reported that niclosamide inhibits the NF-kB
pathway in leukemia cell lines (26) or mTOR signaling in MCF7 breast cancer cells (27). Therefore, we wished to examine
this effect in our model of CRC cells. First, we examined
whether specific inhibitors of the NF-kB or mTOR pathways would affect the viability of CRC cells sensitive to the
effects of niclosamide. The pan-IKK inhibitor PS-1145 was
used to block NF-kB signaling (22) and everolimus (21)
was used to block mTOR signaling. As shown in Figure 3A,
the 3 cell lines, under conditions in which niclosamide
causes inhibition of cell proliferation, were not sensitive to
PS-1145 or everolimus, suggesting that neither the NF-kB
nor mTOR pathway inhibition was a mechanism of action
for niclosamide in our models. We also examined whether
the NF-kB pathway could be perturbed by niclosamide.
When exposed to TNF-a, these cells showed activation in
the NF-kB pathway [elevated phospho-p65 (p-p65) and
translocation of NF-kB p65 to the nucleus; Fig. 3B and
C]. In the same cell lines, TNF-a–induced activation of NFkB could not be blocked by niclosamide whereas they
were blocked by the IKK inhibitor PS-1145 at least in
HCT116 and CaCO2 cells (Fig. 3B and C). Furthermore, to
determine whether niclosamide-induced killing of CRCs
could be prevented by blocking the NF-kB pathway, we

Niclosamide inhibits Wnt/b-catenin pathway activation
and decreases the cytosolic expression of endogenous
Dvl2 and b-catenin in CRC cells
To analyze the effect of niclosamide on Wnt/b-catenin
signaling, we conducted TOPflash assay with CRC cell lines
(CaCO2 and HCT116) and could show that niclosamide
inhibits the activation of this pathway in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 2A). In our previous study, we reported the
downregulation of Dvl2 and b-catenin expression in U2OS
cells by niclosamide. In the present study, we also analyzed
Dvl2 and b-catenin expression in CRC explants and cell lines
and observed that these cancer cells show similar downregulation of these molecules in response to niclosamide
treatment (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, HT29 cells, assessed as less
sensitive to niclosamide on the basis of MTT assay (Fig. 1A),
showed only moderate changes in cytosolic expression of
Dvl2/b-catenin (data not shown), whereas sensitive CRC
explants and cell lines (CRC057, CRC119, HCT116, and
CaCO2) showed more evident downregulation, suggesting
a correlation of the cytotoxic effect and Wnt/Fzd1 signaling
inhibition.

measuring relative firefly luciferase activity units (RLU) normalized to Renilla luciferase. B, CRC explants and CRC cell lines were treated with different
concentrations (0, 1, 5, and 10 mmol/L) of niclosamide overnight (18 hours). After washing cells with PBS, cell lysates were prepared with hypotonic lysis buffer.
Cytosolic fractions of lysates were isolated and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Dvl2 (clone 10B5), anti-b-catenin (clone 7D11), and anti-b-actin
(clone C-11) monoclonal antibodies.

Figure 3. The mTOR and NF-kB pathways were not targeted by niclosamide. A, CRC cell lines (HCT116, HT29, and CaCO2) were treated with
niclosamide (0–10 mmol/L), everolimus (0–9 mmol/L), or PS-1145 (0–50 mmol/L) for 72 hours, and cytotoxicity was analyzed in MTT assays. The relative ratio
(percentages) of OD562 values were calculated for each reagent by setting the OD562 value at a concentration of 0 mmol/L as 100%. B and C, to
examine whether the NF-kB pathway could be perturbed by niclosamide, cancer cells were treated with niclosamide (1 mmol/L) or PS-1145 (10 mmol/L) for 24
hours and further incubated with TNF-a (10 ng/mL) for 1 hour. B, whole-cell lysates were prepared and analyzed with anti-phospho-NF-kB p65 and anti-p65
antibodies by Western blotting. C, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with FITC-conjugated anti-NF-kB p65 antibody (green) for 1 hour. Nuclei
were stained with DAPI (blue). Staining of HCT116 cells is shown. Unclear morphology of nuclei (blue) indicates nuclear translocation of p65 protein. Scale

exposed these cell lines to PS-1145 during niclosamide
treatment. PS-1145 could not inhibit the niclosamideinduced killing of these cancer cells (Fig. 3D). Therefore,
we concluded that neither NF-kB nor mTOR pathway
inhibition was a dominant mechanism of action in our
CRC model system and niclosamide exerts its effect primarily through the Wnt pathway.

(right panel). Similar additive effects were observed with CRC
explant cells at low niclosamide concentrations (Fig. 4B).
These data suggest that niclosamide enhances the antitumor
effect of oxaliplatin.

Additive antiproliferative activity of niclosamide
combined with oxaliplatin
We sought to assess the combination of niclosamide with
oxaliplatin, commonly used to treat CRC. The addition of
oxaliplatin, even at lower concentration (1–2 mmol/L),
induced more killing of CaCO2 cells than niclosamide alone

concentrations of niclosamide were measured in mice following oral administration of 200 mg/kg mixed into polyethylene glycol (Fig. 5A). Win-Nonlin software was used for
the noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis of the
rather complex concentration–time profile observed. Within
the first hour, the concentration–time data showed a sharp
increase (tmax ¼ 0 15 minutes, Cmax ¼ 893.7 ng/mL) and
decrease (30–45 minutes, C ¼ 50–40 ng/mL), followed by a
small but definite "rebound" (1.5 hours, C ¼ 78 ng/mL) after
which plasma concentration decreased gradually through
at least 2 exponential decay processes. Elimination rate
(lZ ¼ 0.217 h1) and the half-life (t1/2 ¼ 3.2 hours) were
calculated from the slope of the 2-point line (12 and 24
hours) and the area under the curve (AUC) between t ¼ 0
and t ¼ 24 hours was calculated as AUClast ¼ 1,011 mg h/L.
The simplest explanation for the complex profile observed is
that the initial "burst" in niclosamide plasma concentration
is caused by a smaller portion of the drug in more soluble
form (AUC0–1 h ¼ 206 mg h/L) and that the "rebound" is the
final portion of the absorption profile of the main and less
soluble fraction of the drug (AUC1–24 h ¼ 805 mg h/L). The 2phase profile at later times cannot be explained by saturation of liver enzymes, as in mammals niclosamide is not
metabolized by the liver. The behavior can be explained
either by differing absorption profiles at different regions of
the gastrointestinal tract or, less likely, by enterohepatic

recycling (reabsorption from gall bladder). The overall complex behavior is most probably the consequence of high
doses administered or by the specificity of the solvent
system (simple pharmacokinetics observed in rats at 5
mg/kg DMSO/cremophor EL; ref. 25). It is important that
from 0.5 to 12 hours after oral intake, plasma concentrations
were relatively stable at the range of 39.5 to 77.6 ng/mL
(0.1–0.2 mmol/L).
To study the niclosamide uptake by solid tumors, we
measured the niclosamide concentrations in tumor tissue
(ng/g tissue) obtained from mice implanted with HCT116
tumor cells and treated with niclosamide (200 mg/kg body
weight per day) or control solvent for 3 weeks. At 24 hours
after the final administration, niclosamide concentrations in
tumor tissue (37 ng/g tissue) were similar to those in plasma
(38 ng/mL; Fig. 5B), suggesting the efficient and reliable
distribution of niclosamide from blood to tumor tissue. Considering that the vascular volume accounts for only a small
fraction of the tissue volume, our data indicate that niclosamide is retained in the tissue and that its concentration at the
site of action may be several-fold higher than that in plasma
(i.e., in the mmol/L range).

however, 100 mg/kg of niclosamide could suppress the growth
of the relatively slow-growing tumor (CRC039) to the same
level. We analyzed another CRC explant (CRC028) and
observed the similar inhibition of tumor growth with niclosamide (25 mg/kg per day) compared with control-treated
mice. Thus, niclosamide was confirmed to inhibit the growth
of human CRCs in NOD/SCID mice.

Dvl2 and b-catenin expression declines in niclosamidetreated CRC tumors in vivo
We wished to document that Wnt pathway intermediaries
would decline after in vivo treatment with niclosamide. CRC
masses (HCT116, CRC028, and CRC039) from mice treated
with niclosamide (25 or 100 mg/kg per day) for 2 or 3 weeks
were excised, formalin-fixed, and analyzed by immunohistochemistry for the expression of Dvl2 and b-catenin. Niclosamide-treated tumors showed decreased levels of cytoplasmic
expression of Dvl2 and b-catenin compared with controltreated tumors (Fig. 6B). This result indicates the prolonged
inhibitory effect of niclosamide in vivo for Wnt/b-catenin
signaling.

administration of niclosamide (200 mg/kg of body weight). Blood samples
were obtained at predose and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 4, 8, 12, and 24
hours after drug administration. Quantification of niclosamide in
mouse plasma was done by LC/MS-MS (19) and reported as ng/mL.
B, NOD/SCID mice were inoculated with HCT116 tumor cells (5  106

sacrificed 24 hours after the last oral administration, and blood and tumor
tissue were collected simultaneously. Tumor tissue was cryocrushed in
liquid nitrogen and homogenized with 3 volumes of deionized water.

mice and 4 days later, oral gavage of niclosamide was initiated
6 times a week. During the course of the treatment with
niclosamide, no obvious side effects were observed in the
mice. As shown in Figure 6A, niclosamide significantly inhibited the growth of both HCT116 and CRC039 tumors. In the
more rapidly growing tumor (HCT116), a dose of 200 mg/kg of
body weight was needed to suppress the tumor growth;

The importance of inappropriate Wnt signaling to the
development and progression of advanced cancers such as
CRC has been well documented. Therefore, components of the
Wnt pathway are prime drug development targets, particularly the accessible plasma membrane receptors such as Fzd
(5, 13–16). However, there are currently no FDA-approved
drugs that regulate Wnt signaling at the level of the Fzd
receptor. We had previously found that niclosamide promotes
Fzd1 internalization and inhibits Wnt/Fzd function, suggesting that it may have antitumor effects. Indeed, in the current
study, we showed that niclosamide has antitumor effects in
vitro against CRC cell lines and CRC cells obtained from
patient resection specimens at low micromolar concentrations, but it has no significant toxicity against nontumor cells,
including PBMCs.
In the current study, we could show by TOPflash assay that
niclosamide can inhibit Wnt pathway activation in CRC. The
mechanism of action of the niclosamide in our studies is
thought to be through internalization of Fzd1 and downregulation of Wnt pathway intermediaries as we reported
previously (17). In its common usage as an antihelminthic
(28, 29) is believed to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation (30).
It has recently been found to be effective at low micromolar
concentrations in preventing the synthesis of corona virus
proteins in a tissue culture model of severe acute respiratory
syndrome (31). Its mechanism of action in this instance has
not been well defined, but niclosamide can interact with DNA
(31). We do not believe that either of these mechanisms are the
operative mechanism in the tumor models, because we would
have expected much greater toxicity to normal tissue if
there were uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation or
DNA-interacting effects in mammalian tissues. Recently, Jin
and colleagues (26) reported that niclosamide inhibited the
NF-kB pathway and increased reactive oxygen species levels

to induce apoptosis in acute myelogenous leukemia cells. In
contrast, we did not observe any inhibitory effect of niclosamide on NF-kB signaling in our CRC model (Fig. 3). Balgi and
colleagues (27) reported mTORC1 inhibition and autophagosome accumulation leading to autophagy in response to
niclosamide exposure. Although we did not formally study
the mTOR pathway in our models, it should be noted that the
cell lines tested in our studies did not have mTOR pathway
dysregulation and were not sensitive to the potent mTOR
inhibitor everolimus (Fig. 3A).
We were encouraged to find that niclosamide had activity
despite the presence of APC mutations in some of the cell
lines and CRC explants. Because APC mutations that impair
the process of targeting b-catenin for elimination are a
common finding in CRCs, we were concerned that niclosamide, exerting its effect through upstream molecules, would
not have activity in APC-mutated tumors. Nonetheless, we
saw similar activity regardless of the APC mutational status,

4180

Cancer Res; 71(12) June 15, 2011

suggesting that inhibition of upstream molecules could
impact downstream molecules as reported by He and colleagues (11). Because functions of both Dvl2 and b-catenin
are shown to be controlled by ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (32), another possible mechanism of
niclosamide function might be its effect on either the
ubiquitination or a proteolytic pathway to cause degradation of Dvl2 and b-catenin, independent of APC and b-catenin mutation status.
One potential concern for the use of niclosamide as an
anticancer therapeutic agent is the poor absorption of this
drug. Indeed, we required higher doses (100–200 mg/kg body
weight) of niclosamide to show significant inhibition of
tumor growth in NOD/SCID mice. Nonetheless, we confirmed
relatively stable concentrations of niclosamide in the plasma
at the range of 39.5 to 77.6 ng/mL (0.1–0.2 mmol/L) from
0.5 to 12 hours after oral intake (200 mg/kg). Importantly,
niclosamide concentrations in tumor tissue showed good

correlation with those in plasma, suggesting the efficient
distribution of niclosamide from blood to tumor tissue.
Furthermore, we observed downregulation of Dvl2 and
b-catenin cytosolic expression in niclosamide-treated tumor
cells in vivo. Thus, oral administration of niclosamide does
result in sufficient distribution of the drug into tumor tissue
to prove a prolonged inhibitory effect on Wnt/b-catenin
signaling, resulting in tumor growth inhibition.
In summary, we showed downregulation of Wnt/b-catenin
signaling and antitumor effects of niclosamide in vitro and in
vivo. No significant toxicity was shown against nontumor cells
in vitro and no obvious side effects were observed in niclosamide-treated mice. We now propose to study niclosamide in
phase I human studies for patients with CRC. Also, because
niclosamide is minimally absorbable from gastrointestinal
tract, we are studying modifications that might permit greater
absorption of the drug. Finally, high exposure of niclosamide
occurs in the intestinal lumen, which supports the use of
niclosamide to prevent induction, progression, or recurrence
of premalignant lesions and/or adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract. The relatively poor absorption and low

systemic levels of niclosamide may make this an attractive
agent for cancer prevention.
