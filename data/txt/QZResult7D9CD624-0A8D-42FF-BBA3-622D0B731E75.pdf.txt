ABSTRACT
Over-expression of transferrin receptor 1 (TFRC) is observed in hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC); however, there is a lack of conclusive information regarding
the mechanisms of this dysregulation. In the present study, we demonstrated a
significant increase in the levels of TFRC mRNA and protein in preneoplastic livers
from relevant experimental models of human hepatocarcinogenesis and in human HCC
cells. Additionally, using the TCGA database, we demonstrated an over-expression of
TFRC in human HCC tissue samples and a markedly decreased level of microRNA-152
(miR-152) when compared to non-tumor liver tissue. The results indicated that the
increase in levels of TFRC in human HCC cells and human HCC tissue samples may
be attributed, in part, to a post-transcriptional mechanism mediated by a downregulation of miR-152. This was evidenced by a strong inverse correlation between
the level of TFRC and the expression of miR-152 in human HCC cells (r = −0.99,
p = 4. 7 × 10−9), and was confirmed by in vitro experiments showing that transfection
of human HCC cell lines with miR-152 effectively suppressed TFRC expression. This
suggests that miR-152-specific targeting of TFRC may provide a selective anticancer
therapeutic approach for the treatment of HCC.

alcohol consumption, obesity, and non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease), the cellular and molecular processes that
mediate HCC development and progression are not fully
understood. This signifies a crucial need to understand
better the underlying mechanisms of HCC development to
prevent the disease and improve its clinical management.
Acquired evidence indicates that cancer [4],
including HCC [5, 6], along with various cancer-associated
molecular abnormalities, exhibits profound alterations in
systemic and intracellular iron homeostasis. Specifically,
patients with HCC are characterized by an abnormal iron
uptake [7], an excessive accumulation of hepatic iron [5],
a prevalence of mutations in the hemochromatosis (HFE)
gene [8], one of the main mediators of iron metabolism,
and a pronounced suppression in the expression of

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent
type of liver cancer and a major contributor to annual
cancer mortality rates [1, 2]. While the overall cancer
incidence in the United States has steadily declined [3],
the incidence of HCC continues to increase [2, 3]. This
is evidenced by comprehensive epidemiological data
showing that the overall age-adjusted incidence rates of
HCC tripled in the United States in the period between
1975 and 2005 [2] and continued to rise in 1990–2009 [3].
HCC arises through a complex multistage process
of interconnected events and various molecular, cellular,
and metabolic deregulations driven by genetic and
epigenetic aberrations. While the main risk factors that
account for most HCC cases are well identified (chronic

hepcidin (HAMP) [9], the central regulator of iron
homeostasis in mammals [10]. Importantly, dysregulated
iron metabolism has been found not only in both fullfledged rodent and human HCC but also in several
chronic liver pathological states associated with the
development of HCC, including chronic hepatitis B and
C virus infection [11, 12], alcoholic and non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease [13–14], and liver fibrosis [15].
While the development of HCC associated with iron
overload has been studied extensively, there is a lack
of conclusive information to clarify the role of iron
metabolism disturbances in liver carcinogenesis that is not
caused by iron overload.
On the basis of our previous observations of cancerrelated aberrations in intracellular iron homeostasis
characterized by an altered expression of the transferrin
receptor 1 (Tfrc), a main regulator of transferrin-bound iron
uptake in mammalian cells during liver carcinogenesis [16],
the goal of the present study was to investigate the
underlying mechanisms associated with a cancer-related Tfrc
dysregulation by using in vitro and in vivo models of liver
carcinogenesis. We found substantial up-regulation of TFRC
in preneoplastic livers, human liver cancer cell lines, and
human HCC tissue samples. Furthermore, we demonstrated
that the over-expression of TFRC was accompanied by
and may be attributed mechanistically to a markedly reduced
expression of microRNA-152 (miR-152) in HCC.

To determine further whether or not TFRC
alterations found in preneoplastic livers exist also in
liver cancer cells, the expression of TFRC and level of
TFRC protein were investigated in human liver cancer
cells in vitro. Figure 2 shows (Figure 2A) that human
liver cancer cells expressed TFRC at a level that varied
approximately 6.2- to 7.6-fold, with the lowest expression
being found in α-fetoprotein- and EPCAM-negative
SK-HEP1 cells as compared to α-fetoprotein- and EPCAMpositive PLC/PRF/5, Hep3B, and HepG2 cells [23, 24].
Since gene expression does not always correlate with the
level of a protein encoded by the corresponding gene [25],
the level of TFRC was measured in liver cancer cells. The
level of TFRC was increased, 3.6-fold, in HepG2 cells
only, while not different in SK-HEP1, PLC/PRF/5, or
Hep3B cells (Figure 2B). Additionally, HepG2 and Hep3B
cells were characterised by 2.9 times greater content of
intracellular iron than SK-HEP1 and PLC/PRF/5 cells
(Figure 2C).

Mechanism of TFRC dysregulation in
hepatocarcinogenesis
It is well-established that the expression of the TFRC
gene is regulated at transcriptional and post-transcriptional
levels [26, 27]. In light of this, the role of epigenetic
mechanisms in TFRC dysregulation at the transcriptional
level in human liver cancer cells was investigated.
Figure 3 shows that there were no differences in the level
of TFRC CpG island methylation (Figure 3B) or in the
promoter enrichment by histone H3K9ac, H3K9me3,
H3K27ac, and H3K27me3 (Figure 3D) between
SK-HEP1 and HepG2 cells, two cell lines characterized by
vast differences in TFRC expression.
At the post-transcriptional level, the regulation of
TFRC occurs through an interaction of iron-regulatory
proteins 1 and 2 (IRP1 and IRP2), with the iron-regulatory
elements located in the 3′-utranslated region (3′-UTR) of
the TFRC mRNA [28]. Figure 3E shows that the level
of IRP1 protein in HepG2 cells was markedly lower,
while the level of IRP2 protein was substantially greater
as compared to SK-HEP1 cells. Similarly, an increased
level of IRP2 was found in the preneoplastic livers in rats
treated with 2-AAF or subjected to a “resistant hepatocyte
model” of hepatocarcinogenesis (data not shown).
The presence of TFRC-expression controlling
elements in the 3′-UTR suggests that the expression
of TFRC may be mediated by microRNAs (miRNAs).
In order to investigate this mechanism of TFRC
dysregulation at the post-transcriptional level, three
public databases for target gene prediction, PicTar (http://
pictar.mdc-berlin.de), DIANA-TarBase, version 7 (http://
www.microrna.gr/tarbase), and TargetScan, version 6.2

RESULTS
TFRC and FPN1 proteins and the hepatic iron
content in preneoplastic livers
Our previous study of 2-acetylaminofluorene
(2-AAF)-induced rat hepatocarcinogenesis demonstrated
extensive alterations of iron metabolism in preneoplastic
livers, characterized by an aberrant expression of
genes involved in the maintenance of intracellular iron
homeostasis, especially an up-regulation of Tfrc and
Fpn1 genes and a down-regulation of Hamp. In order to
investigate the underlying mechanisms of iron metabolism
disturbances during liver carcinogenesis, we first
determined the levels of TFRC and FPN1 proteins in the
livers of rats undergoing hepatocarcinogenesis. Figure 1
shows that levels of TFRC protein in the preneoplastic
livers in rats treated with 2-AAF (Figure 1A) and in rats
subjected to a “resistant hepatocyte model” (Figure 1B)
were significantly increased, with the magnitude of
changes being greater in rats subjected to a more severe
“resistant hepatocyte model” of hepatocarcinogenesis. In
contrast, levels of FPN1 either did not change (2-AAF
model) or decreased (“resistant hepatocyte model”).
This resulted in a marked increase of TFRC/FPN1 ratio
in preneoplastic livers. However, despite these changes
favoring iron uptake, the hepatic iron content in the
preneoplastic livers was significantly reduced (Figure 1).

(http://www.targetscan.org), were used to screen for
miRNAs with the potential to bind to the 3′-UTR of TFRC.
The results of in silico screening analysis demonstrated
that several miRNAs, including miR-152, miR-194, and
miR-320, could target the 3′-UTR of TFRC mRNA.
Hence, the expression of these miRNAs was investigated
in human liver cancer cells.
The expression of miR-152 in α-fetoprotein-positive
PLC/PRF/5, Hep3B, and HepG2 cells was considerably
lower than in α-fetoprotein-negative SK-HEP1 cells
(Figure 4A) and inversely correlated with the expression
of TFRC (Figure 4B). In contrast, the expression of
miR-194 in PLC/PRF/5, Hep3B, and HepG2 cells was
substantially greater than in SK-HEP1 cells and there
was no major difference in the level of miR-320 among
cell lines (Supplementary Figure 1). To test whether or
not miR-152 directly targets TFRC, constructs retaining
the core region of the TFRC 3′-UTR that harbors the

putative binding site for miR-152 or mutated sequence
in the miR-152 binding site were constructed and then
co-transfected together with miR-152 into SK-HEP1
cells. Figure 4C shows that miR-152 efficiently suppressed
luciferase activity by 22.3%. In contrast, miR-152 did
not affect luciferase activity in cells transfected with
the TFRC 3′-UTR that harbored the mutated miR-152
binding site (data not shown). To confirm further the
involvement of miR-152 in the regulation of TFRC at the
post-transcriptional level, HepG2 cells were transfected
with miR-152, miR-194, miR-320 microRNA mimics, or
scrambled RNA oligonucleotide. Transfection with miR152 efficiently down-regulated TFRC at both mRNA and
protein levels (Figure 4D and 4E), while transfection with
either miR-194 or miR-320 did not (data not shown).
Additionally, transfection of HepG2 cells with miR152 significantly reduced the level of intracellular iron
(Figure 4F) and colony formation (Figure 4G).

Expression of TFRC and miR-152
in human HCC

with HCC development, and the asymptomatic nature of
early disease are major challenges for the detection and
clinical management of HCC. It is commonly accepted
that a better understanding of pathways and processes
involved in the pathogenesis of HCC may lead to a
better prediction of disease, the identification of novel
molecular targets, and provide the opportunity for the
development of more appropriate and curative treatment
approaches.
In the present study, we investigated the
role and mechanisms of TFRC dysregulation in
liver carcinogenesis by using two rat models of
hepatocarcinogenesis, human liver cancer cell lines,
and human HCC gene expression data. The results
of this study demonstrate that the level of TFRC was
substantially greater in the preneoplastic livers of
rats undergoing carcinogenesis, in α-fetoprotein- and
EPCAM-positive PLC/PRF/5, Hep3B, and HepG2 human
liver cells, and in human HCC tissue samples. Previously,
up-regulation of TFRC has been observed in both rodent
and human liver carcinogenesis. Specifically, Pascale

The expression levels of TFRC, miR-152, and miR194 in human HCC tissue samples and normal liver samples
were extracted from the TCGA database. Figure 5 shows that
the expression of TFRC in HCC tissue samples (n = 345)
was significantly greater as compared to normal livers and
increased with the progression of HCC. In contrast, the level
of miR-152 was markedly reduced in HCC tissue samples,
with the values being significantly lower at each tumor
stage of HCC progression, and inversely correlated with the
TFRC expression (p = 0.0078). There were no differences
in the expression of miR-194 between normal and HCC
samples (Supplementary Figure 2).

DISCUSSION
HCC is a complex and highly prevalent lethal
cancer worldwide. Rapid progression, insufficient
knowledge of cellular and molecular processes associated

et al. [30] and Takahashi et al. [31], using two different
models of rat hepatocarcinogenesis, demonstrated an
over-expression of TFRC in preneoplastic glutathioneS-transferase placental form (GSTP)-positive foci. More
importantly, the expression of TFRC was increased in
parallel with the stage of carcinogenesis. A separate,
but similar, study by Mizukami et al. [32] confirmed
this finding and suggested that up-regulation of TFRC
may be involved in the formation and progression of
GSTP-positive preneoplastic lesions. This suggestion is
supported by the findings of the present study and by a
recent report demonstrating an up-regulation of TFRC in
human HCC samples as compared to adjacent not-tumor
tissue and that TFRC over-expression was significantly
associated with serum levels of α-fetoprotein [33].
Several mechanisms may contribute to the
dysregulation of TFRC. First, it has been suggested
that over-expression of TFRC may be a response
to intracellular iron deficiency during liver
carcinogenesis [33]. The results of the present study
showing up-regulation of TFRC in preneoplastic
liver with decreased hepatic iron content support this
suggestion. Second, it has been shown that under the
iron-limited conditions, IRP1 and, especially, IRP2
increase the expression of TFRC; however, IRP2 has
been shown to be the chief physiologic regulator of
iron metabolism [28, 34]. This was evidenced by the
fact that the over-expression of IRP2 is associated
with up-regulation of TFRC [35]. Additionally, it has
been demonstrated that the IRP2 binding activity is
selectively activated by low iron, positively correlated
with a TFRC expression [36], and the induction of IRP2
promoted tumor growth [37], while up-regulation of
IRP1 exhibited a tumor suppressive effect [38]. These
findings are in good agreement with our observations of
up-regulation of TFRC and IRP2 and down-regulation
of IRP1 in α-fetoprotein- and EPCAM-positive HepG2
cells as compared α-fetoprotein-negative SK-HEP1
cells. Third, Du et al. [39] have demonstrated a direct
role for the iron regulatory hepatic hormone hepcidin
in the inhibition of TFRC expression. Importantly, a
reduction of hepcidin expression and an over-expression
of TFRC during experimental liver carcinogenesis and
in human HCC has been reported in several studies [9,
16, 40]. Finally, several transcription factors, including
MYC and STAT5, are involved in regulation of
TFRC [25, 41, 42]. Specifically, O’Donnell et al. [42]
demonstrated that MYC directly binds to the conserved
canonical E-box sequence (CACGTG) in intron1 of the
TFRC gene and activates its expression. Furthermore,
the latter study demonstrated that enforced up-regulation
of TFRC facilitates cell proliferation, promotes
tumorigenesis of Rat1a-myc cells, and increases the rate
of tumor formation in vivo.

The results of the present study showed an
additional mechanism of the regulation of TFRC
expression at post-transcriptional level mediated by
miR-152, especially in full-fledged human HCC cells.
It has been reported previously that three miRNAs,
miR-31, miR-210, and miR-320, in addition to
miR-152, may target TFRC [43–45]; however,
considering a high degree of miRNA tissue specificity,
the biological significance of any given miRNA-mRNA
interaction should be evaluated in a specific target tissue
context. The results of the present study demonstrate
that miR-152, in addition to miR-31, miR-210, and
miR-320 miRNAs, targets TFRC directly, evidenced
by functional miR-152-TFRC analyses and an inverse
correlation between markedly decreased miR-152 level
and TFRC up-regulation in human HCC cells and HCC
tissue samples. This finding is in a good agreement
with a previous report that showed down-regulation of
miR-152 in human HBV-related HCC [46]. Likewise,
Chen et al. [47] have reported a significant downregulation of miR-320 in liver tumors.
Another important finding of this study is that an
inhibition of TFRC expression by enforced up-regulation
of miR-152 in human HepG2 cells was associated with a
reduction of the level of intracellular iron and tumorigenic
potential of the miR-152-transfected HepG2 cells. It
has been reported previously that modulation of iron
availability in cancer cells by the use of iron chelating
agents or through transferrin receptor-targeted treatments
exhibits potent anti-tumor activity, including an anti-HCC
effect. Specifically, treatment of liver cancer cells with
iron chelators significantly decreased the cellular iron
content and exhibited strong anti-proliferative and tumorgrowth suppressing effects [48]. Similarly, inhibition
of TFRC, either via knocking down of TFRC or by antiTFRC antibodies, induced iron depletion and cell death
[29, 49]. In light of this, the results of the present study
suggest that targeting of TFRC by miR-152 in HCC may
be an attractive therapeutic approach for the treatment
of HCC.
In summary, the data presented herein indicate
that over-expression of TFRC may be responsible
for profound cancer-associated abnormalities in
cellular iron metabolism during liver carcinogenesis.
Mechanistically, the up-regulation of TFRC may be
attributed to a markedly reduced expression of miR-152.
Future studies are needed to determine the safety and
therapeutic efficiency of correcting cancer-associated
aberrations in iron homeostasis by modulating iron
availability through the use of miRNA-based transferrin
receptor targeting. However, the results of this study
provide support for developing of treatment strategies
for HCC through corrections of iron metabolism
disturbances.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Western blot analysis of protein levels

In vivo rat models of rat hepatocarcinogenesis

Liver tissue and cell lysates were prepared as
described previously [16]. Extracts containing equal
quantities of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on
8–15% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF
membranes. Membranes were probed with primary
antibodies against transferrin receptor 1 (TFRC, TFR1,
CD71; 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA), ferroportin (FPN1, MTP1; 1:1000; Alpha Diagnostic
International Inc., San Antonio, TX), iron-regulatory
proteins 1 (IRP1; 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
and iron-regulatory proteins 2 (IRP2; 1:500; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). IRDye® 800 conjugated secondary
anti-rabbit and anti-goat antibodies (1:15000; LI-COR
Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) were used for visualization.
Blots were scanned and analyzed with an Odyssey CLx
Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). Equal
protein loading was confirmed by immunostaining against
GAPDH (1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).

Two well-established models of rat hepatocar­
cinogenesis, a 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF)-induced
model [17] and a “resistant hepatocyte model” [18],
which recapitulate the development of human HCC [19],
were used in this study. The in-life portion of this study,
tissue collection protocols, and results of histopathological
analyses, are detailed in Bagnyukova et al. [20] and
Kuroiwa-Trzmielina et al. [21]. Briefly, in 2-AAF model
of liver carcinogenesis male Sprague-Dawley rats were
fed diet containing 0.02% of 2-AAF for 24 weeks. In the
“resistant hepatocyte model”, male Wistar rats received a
single intraperitoneal injection of N-nitrosodiethylamine
(DEN; 200 mg/kg body weight), following by a treatment
with 2-AAF (20 mg/kg body weight) for four consecutive
days, then were subjected to a 2/3 partial hepatectomy,
and two additional 2-AAF treatments. Rats were sacrificed
6 weeks after DEN initiation.

Measurement of hepatic iron content by
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry

Cell lines and cell culture

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
(ICP-MS) was used to measure the total hepatic iron
content. Briefly, microwave dissolution of the liver
samples was performed with 4.0 mL of concentrated
HNO3 using 100 mg of tissue, followed by quantitative
transfer and dilution using 2% HNO3. Tissue microwave
dissolution was accomplished by application of up to
1600 W power, 200°C for 35 min utilizing a MicrowaveAccelerated Reaction System Model MARS-X (CEM
Corporation, Matthews, NC). The iron content was
determined with an Agilent 8800 Inductively Coupled
Plasma mass spectrometer (Santa Clara, CA), utilizing
the 56Fe isotope. 45Sc, at 100 ng/mL, was used as an
internal standard. Helium collision cell gas was used for
the elimination of argon oxide (40Ar16O+) poly atomic
interferences.

SK-HEP1, PLC/PRF/5, Hep3B, and HepG2 human
liver cancer cell lines were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and
maintained according to ATCC’s recommendations. Cells
were seeded at density 0.5 × 106 viable cells per 100 mm
plate, and the media was changed every other day for
4 days. The cells were scrapped onto ice, washed in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and immediately frozen
at −80°C for subsequent analyses.

RNA extraction and quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from liver tissues and
cells using miRNeasy Mini kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA
(2 μg) was reverse transcribed using random primers
and High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kits
(Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol and gene expression was
determined by quantitative reverse transcription PCR
(qRT-PCR) using TaqMan gene expression assays (Life
Technologies). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate.
The relative amount of each mRNA transcript was
determined using the 2−ΔΔCt method.

Quantitation of intracellular iron by the
colorimetric ferrozine assay
The intracellular iron content of the human liver
cancer cells was determined by colorimetric ferrozinebased assay as detailed in Riemer et al. [22].

Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation analysis
Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP)
was performed with MethylMiner Methylated
DNA Enrichment kits (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
methylation status of the CpG island located within

qRT-PCR analysis of microRNA expression
The level of miR-152, miR-194, and miR-320 in

harvested by mild trypsinization and the viability of
cells was monitored with an MTT test. The cells were then
re-seeded and the transfection was repeated. Seventy-two
hours after the second transfection, adherent cells were
harvested by mild trypsinization, washed in PBS, and
the viability of cells was again determined. The cells
were then immediatelly frozen at −80°C for subsequent
analyses. The experiments were repeated twice, and each
cell line tested in triplicate.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
Formaldehyde cross-linking and ChIP assays
with primary antibodies against histone H3K9ac,
H3K9me3, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3 (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA) were performed by using a Chromatin
Immunoprecipitation Assay kit (Millipore Corporation,
Billerica, MA). Purified DNA from immunoprecipitates
and input DNA were analyzed by qPCR with primers for
the promoter/first exon region of the TFRC gene. The
results were normalized to the amount of input DNA and
presented as fold change for each DNA in HepG2 cells
relative to those in SK-HEP1 cells.

Soft agar colony formation assay
HepG2 cells (10 × 103 cells), transfected with
20 nM of either miR-152 mimic or scrambled RNA
oligonucleotide, were seeded onto 0.7% noble agar in
growth media. After 20 days of growth, colonies were
stained with 0.005% crystal violet, examined by light
microscopy using an Olympus CK2 phase contrast
inverted microscope (Olympus America Inc., Center
Valley, PA), and digitally photographed at identical
exposure settings.

TFRC 3′-UTR luciferase reporter assay
A luciferase miRNA 3′-UTR target vector carrying
the predicted miR-152 binding site in the TFRC 3′- UTR,
miRNA 3′-UTR target vector harboring two base
mutations in the predicted miR-152 binding site in the
TFRC 3′-UTR, and miRNA 3′-UTR target control vector
were constructed and purchased from GeneCopoeia Inc.
(Rockville, MD). To assess the direct interaction between
miR-152 and the TFRC 3′-UTR, the luciferase
constructs (1 μg) and the 80 nM of miR-152 mimic
(Life Technologies) were co-transfected into SK-HEP1
cells, which were seeded in 6-well plates (1 × 106 cells/
transfection) using Lipofectamin™ 3000 transfection
reagent (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer’s
recommendations. SK-HEP1 cells transfected with miR™
Negative Control #1 (Life Technologies) served as the
control. Forty-eight hours after the transfection, cells
were harvested by mild trypsinization, washed in PBS
and the luciferase activity was measured using a LucPair Duo-Luciferase Assay Kit 2.0 (GeneCopoeia Inc.)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Retrieval of data from online database
Gene expression data for TFRC, miR-152, and
miR-194, and clinical and tumor pathological data were

Statistical analyses
Results are presented as mean ± S.D. Data were
analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA),
with pair-wise comparisons being made by the StudentNewman-Keuls method. When necessary, the data were
natural log transformed before conducting the analyses to
maintain a more equal variance or normal data distribution.
Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were
used to determine the strength of association between
levels of TFRC mRNA and the expression of miR-152.
P-values <0.05 were considered significant.
