Abstract:
We document for the first time that sanctuary in an organ which expresses
high levels of the enzyme cytidine deaminase (CDA) is a mechanism of cancer cell
resistance to cytidine analogues. This mechanism could explain why historically,
cytidine analogues have not been successful chemotherapeutics against hepatotropic
cancers, despite efficacy in vitro. Importantly, this mechanism of resistance can be
readily reversed, without increasing toxicity to sensitive organs, by combining cytidine
analogue with an inhibitor of cytidine deaminase (tetrahydrouridine). Specifically, CDA
rapidly metabolizes cytidine analogues into inactive uridine counterparts. Hence, to
determine if sheltering/protection of cancer cells in organs which express high levels
of CDA (e.g., liver) is a mechanism of resistance, we utilized a murine xenotransplant
model of myeloid cancer that is sensitive to epigenetic therapeutic effects of the
cytidine analogue decitabine in vitro and hepato-tropic in vivo. Treatment of tumorbearing mice with decitabine (subcutaneous 0.2mg/kg 2X/week) doubled median
survival and significantly decreased extra-hepatic tumor burden, but hepatic
tumor burden remained substantial, to which the animals eventually succumbed.
Combining a clinically-relevant inhibitor of CDA (tetrahydrouridine) with a lower
dose of decitabine (subcutaneous 0.1mg/kg 2X/week) markedly decreased liver
tumor burden without blood count or bone marrow evidence of myelotoxicity, and
with further improvement in survival. In conclusion, sanctuary in a CDA-rich organ
is a mechanism by which otherwise susceptible cancer cells can resist the effects of
decitabine epigenetic therapy. This protection can be reversed without increasing
myelotoxicity by combining tetrahydrouridine with a lower dose of decitabine.

INTRODUCTION

to cytidine analogues, and there are no routine measures
in place to reverse it, even though it could explain the
historically poor responses of hepatotropic cancers treated
with cytidine analogues[9-10].
The cytidine analogue drugs 5-azacytidine and
decitabine have a therapeutic molecular epigenetic
effect, depletion of DNA methyl-transferase 1 (DNMT1)
(5-azacytidine is converted to decitabine by ribonucleotide
reductase prior to DNA incorporation), at non-cytotoxic
concentrations well below 0.5 µM[11-17]. Hence,
in contrast to the cytidine analogues cytarabine and
gemcitabine, which are administered at high dosage
(100-3000 mg/m2) derived from maximum tolerated
levels and intended for anti-metabolite cytotoxic effects,
5-azacytidine and decitabine are administered at relatively

Cytidine analogue chemotherapeutics are rapidly
metabolized into inactive uridine counterparts by the
enzyme cytidine deaminase (CDA)[1-4]. The impact
of CDA on the pharmacology of cytidine analogues is
illustrated by the difference between in vitro and in vivo
half-life: the half-life of decitabine in buffer in vitro at
370C is >10 hours[5], by contrast, the half-life in vivo is
<10 minutes[6], a drastic reduction largely attributable to
CDA[2, 7-8]. Hence, it is possible that high expression of
CDA in some organs, such as the liver, provides protection
for malignant cells from the effects of cytidine analogues.
However, such protection or sanctuary has not been
formally evaluated as an actual mechanism of resistance

low dosage (5-75 mg/m2). These low dosages may be even
more susceptible to failure caused by CDA-mediated
degradation and sanctuary, limiting the clinical role of
these unique epigenetic therapy agents.
The uridine analogue tetrahydrouridine (THU),
a competitive inhibitor of CDA, has been used as a
CDA inhibitor in combination with cytidine analogues
pre-clinically and clinically for some decades, without
documentation of toxic side-effects from THU[2-4,
8, 11, 18-25]. Sanctuary in a CDA-rich organ as an
actual mechanism of resistance has not been evaluated,

thus, neither has the ability of THU to reverse such
sanctuary. For safe and practical clinical application,
THU should improve distribution of cytidine analogue
into the sanctuary organ but without increasing toxicity
in sensitive tissues, for example, the bone marrow. Hence,
the objectives of the present study were to evaluate if the
liver, a CDA-rich organ, can function as a sanctuary site
for cancer cells which are otherwise known to be sensitive
to decitabine treatment effects, and furthermore, to
determine if the addition of THU to the treatment regimen
can reverse such sanctuary, and do so without increasing

(IACUC). p53-null THP1 cells were purchased from
ATCC (Manassas, VA). This morphologically monocytoid
myeloid leukemia cell line contains an MLL-AF9 fusion,
is homozygously mutated at the TP53 and CDKN2A
loci, and demonstrates hepatic tropism in vivo[26]. The
cells used for xeno-transplantation were transfected to
express luciferase. THP1 cells were transplanted by
tail-vein injection (0.4 x106/mouse) into non-irradiated
6-8 week old NSG mice. Mice were anesthetized with
isofluorane before transplantation. Beginning on day 5
after inoculation, animals were treated with vehicle (PBS),
subcutaneous decitabine 0.2 mg/kg 2X/week (Monday,
Thursday), or intraperitoneal THU 4mg/kg 30 minutes
before a lower dose of subcutaneous decitabine 0.1 mg/
kg 2X/week (Monday, Thursday). Alternatively, animals
were treated with PBS, subcutaneous decitabine 0.2 mg/

kg 2X/week or with THU in combination with the same
dose of decitabine. Animals were checked daily and were
euthanized by an IACUC approved method for signs of
distress. To anatomically localize THP-1 cells in living
mice, the substrate D-Luciferin (15 mg/ml D-luciferin in
sterile PBS (Promega) was injected intra-peritoneal into
one mouse per treatment group and mice were imaged
after 10 minutes using an IVIS-200 CCD camera imaging
system (Xenogen, Alameda,CA).

Measurement of CDA enzyme activity:
Using a modification of previously published
methods[27], conversion of cytidine into uridine by
homogenized liver tissue at 370C was measured by high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Liver tissue
(1mg) was gently homogenized in 1ml iced reaction buffer
supplemented with protease inhibitors. Reaction buffer
of 0.1M Tris/HCL pH 7.5 (265µl) was added to 25 µl of
homogenized liver tissue followed by addition of cytidine
to a final concentration of 4.1 mM and 5-flourouridine
(0.381 mM) as an internal control (5-fluoruridine is
not metabolized by CDA). This reaction mixture was
incubated at 370C for 60 minutes and the reaction
terminated by addition of 50µl of 1N hypochloric acid.
Blanks used in calculations (described below) consisted
of the above but with cytidine substrate added at the end
of the 60 minute incubation period. After termination
of reactions, protein was precipitated by addition of
trichloroacetic acid (TCA, 2%). Supernatant (20µl) was
injected for HPLC analysis with ammonium acetate
(15mM) as the mobile phase with a flow rate of 0.35
mL/min through Xbridge™ OST C18, 2.5µm, 4.6x50mm
column on Dionex UltiMate® 3000 μ-HPLC system
supported with Chromeleon® 7.1 chromatography dtata
system (Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA). Retention
time and peak area of uridine at 260nm were compared
to the internal control for each injection. The average net
uridine peak area of test minus blank was calculated for
each test sample. Uridine known concentrations from 0.0
to 95.8µM were used to plot a standard curve to calculate
uridine amount based on the net uridine peak area. CDA
enzyme unit activity was defined as the amount of enzyme
that produces 1µM of uridine in 1 minute, reported as
mU enzyme activity per minute. A purified CDA enzyme
(genotype A79A, specific activity of 308.9U/mg, gift of
Professor Silvia Vincenzetti, Universita di Camerino,
Italy) was used as a calibrator and for quality control.
Multiple runs with known concentrations of uridine were
used to confirm accuracy and precision, and confirmed
between run variability of < 5%.

enzyme activity was observed 30 minutes and 6 hours

and spleen obtained after euthanasia for distress (Figure
1A-D). Treatment with decitabine significantly reduced the
tumor burden in all sites (Figure 1A-D), and significantly
extended median survival (61 days) compared to PBS (38
days, Log Rank p=0.0013) (Figure 1E). However, there
remained strikingly substantial liver tumor (average 3.5
g in decitabine-treated mice compared to average > 5 g in
PBS-treated mice) (Figure 1A-D).

THU reversed cancer cell sanctuary in the liver
without causing myelotoxicity.

Combining THU with a lower dose of decitabine
reversed sanctuary:

If combination therapy is to be safe and practical,
ideally, it should reverse cancer cell protection from
treatment without increasing toxicity to sensitive tissues
such as the bone marrow. To evaluate the myelotoxicity
of decitabine and THU-decitabine treatment, peripheral
blood counts were measured on treatment day 1 and 30 by
tail vein phlebotomy. Compared to PBS treated controls,
there was no significant decrease in WBC or platelet
counts in decitabine treated mice (the dose and schedule
were selected for non-cytotoxic DNMT1 depletion as
described previously[26]), or in mice treated with THU
in combination with the decreased dose of decitabine 0.1
mg/kg (Figure 4A). However, in mice treated with THUdecitabine without decreasing the dose of decitabine
(THU-decitabine 0.2 mg/kg), there was a significant
decrease in white blood cell counts (Figure 4A). To
further evaluate for myelotoxicity, bone marrow aspirates
obtained at the time of euthanasia were evaluated by flowcytometry for γ-H2AX, a marker of DNA damage and
repair. There was no increase in γ-H2AX in bone marrow
from decitabine or THU-decitabine 0.1 mg/kg treated
mice, but a significant increase was noted in bone marrow
from THU-decitabine 0.2 mg/kg treated mice (Figure 4B).
Flow cytometric evaluation of bone marrow granulocyte
content (Ly6G) and inspection of Giemsa-stained bone
marrow cytospin preparations also confirmed lack of
myelotoxicity with decitabine alone or THU-decitabine
0.1 mg/kg, but myelotoxicity with THU-decitabine 0.2
mg/kg (Figure 4C, D).

Similar to treatment with decitabine alone, THU
4 mg/kg intraperitoneal combined with a lower dose of
decitabine (0.1 mg/kg instead of 0.2 mg/kg) 2X/week
extended median survival (70 days) compared to control
PBS treatment (Log Rank p=0.00421, n=5/group) (Figure
1E). However, in comparison to mice treated with
decitabine alone, combination THU-decitabine largely
eliminated liver tumor burden (average 0.8 g in THUdecitabine treated mice compared to average 3.5 g with
decitabine treatment, p<0.001) (Figure 1A, B). Extrahepatic tumor burden was decreased by a similar extent
by both decitabine and THU-decitabine (Figure 1C, D).
These experiments were repeated using the same
decitabine dose alone or in combination with THU (in the
above experiments, the decitabine dose was lowered for
combination with THU); treatment groups: (i) PBS 2X/
week, (ii) subcutaneous decitabine 0.2 mg/kg 2X/week,
(iii) subcutaneous decitabine 0.2 mg/kg 2X/week 30
minutes after intraperitoneal THU 4mg/kg (n=5/group).
Again, the addition of THU substantially eliminated liver
tumor burden, although this regimen, in which the dose of
decitabine combined with THU was not decreased (Figure
2), did not increase survival compared to decitabine alone,
possibly because of myelotoxicity (described below).

Murine liver expresses substantially higher levels
of CDA than murine spleen.

DISCUSSION

The differences between liver and spleen in tumor
burden and its reduction by decitabine alone suggested
that CDA expression could be substantially higher in
murine liver than in spleen. This was confirmed by QRTPCR: CDA mRNA levels were significantly higher (>5fold, p<0.01) in murine liver compared to spleen (Figure
3A).

At the cellular level, a number of different
mechanisms have been shown to mediate resistance
of cancer cells to cytidine analogues. These include
downregulation of deoxycytidine kinase (DCK), the
enzyme that executes the rate-limiting phosphorylation
step necessary for DNA incorporation of cytidine
analogues, downregulation of the nucleoside transporters
that mediate cellular uptake of cytidine analogues by the
pyrimidine salvage pathway, and upregulation of CDA
within cancer cells (reviewed in[28]). Here, another
mechanism of resistance was demonstrated: protection for
otherwise treatment-sensitive cancer cells within a tissue
environment that expresses high levels of CDA. This
mechanism does not require adaptation or evolution by

enzyme activity, THU 4 mg/kg alone was administered
by the intraperitoneal route to 12 mice. These mice

that it dampens the inter-individual variability in
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics caused by
differences in CDA activity between individuals[11],
and reverses resistance caused by upregulation of CDA
expression within cancer cells[2, 7-8, 11, 34].
The molecular actions of decitabine offer an
important alternative to conventional apoptosis-based
chemotherapy, since low, non-cytotoxic doses can
induce cell cycle exit in cancer cells by p53-independent
differentiation pathways[26, 34-35, 38]. However, this
relatively low dosage could be particularly vulnerable to
treatment failure caused by CDA-mediated degradation,
exemplified by protection for cancer cells in CDArich organs. The present observations demonstrate that
CDA-inhibition with THU can reverse such sanctuary
without necessarily increasing myelotoxicity, so long
as the decitabine dosage used in combination with THU
is decreased. We are actively developing oral THUdecitabine for clinical use, and a Phase 1 clinical trial is
ongoing[11].

the malignancy, just preferential or incidental localization
of cancer cells within a CDA-rich tissue. This mechanism
could explain the very limited clinical activity of cytidine
analogues against hepatotropic cancers: in clinical trials of
single-agent gemcitabine to treat liver cancer, the overall
response rates where 0% and 2%[9-10], even though liver
cancer cells are sensitive to these drugs in vitro[29].
A discussion of resistance requires consideration
of therapeutic index[30-31]: at relatively high
concentrations (>0.5-1µM), decitabine, similar to other
cytidine analogues, demonstrates anti-metabolite, DNAdamaging effects that can induce irreversible cell cycle
exit by apoptosis. However, cancer cells very frequently
inactivate key apoptosis-pathway genes (e.g., TP53,
p16/CDKN2A) by mutation or deletion[30-31]. Hence,
high anti-metabolite concentrations can have a poor
therapeutic index, inducing apoptosis in normal cells
(in which apoptosis genes are intact) but not necessarily
proliferating cancer cells[26]. At low concentrations,
however, decitabine is non-cytotoxic: unlike cytidine
analogues such as cytarabine or gemcitabine, the sugar
moiety in decitabine is unmodified, and decitabine can
incorporate into DNA without terminating DNA chainelongation[12-13]. These low concentrations are sufficient
to deplete DNMT1 and produce a therapeutic epigenetic
effect. This is because cancer cells (including cancer
‘stem’ cells[32]) express strikingly high levels of master
lineage-driving transcription factors, yet have paradoxical
epigenetic repression of late-maturation MYC-antagonist
target genes of these transcription factors. DNMT1
depletion disrupts the chromatin-modifying enzyme
network that mediates this aberrant repression, renews
expression of the late-maturation MYC-antagonist genes,
and triggers cell cycle exit by p53/p16-independent
differentiation pathways[26, 32-35]. The same treatment
maintains the self-renewal of normal stem cells, as these
cells do not express high levels of lineage-specifying
transcription factors needed to activate late-maturation
MYC-antagonist genes[36-37]. In brief, the consequences
of non-cytotoxic DNMT1 depletion are determined by
the baseline maturation context, and the difference in
maturation context of cancer versus normal stem cells
creates a favorable therapeutic index for non-cytotoxic
DNMT1 depletion by decitabine (reviewed in[32], and
illustrated by efficacy without myelotoxicity in the present
study). Combining THU with decitabine assists with
this mode of therapy not just by interdicting sanctuary
but also in other ways: THU inhibition of intestinal and
hepatic CDA substantially increases oral bioavailability
of decitabine. Oral administration is favored since this
route of administration does not produce the high Cmax
observed with intravenous administration that can cause
off-target antimetabolite effects and cytotoxicity, while
the combination with THU extends the Tmax to increase
S-phase specific depletion of DNMT1[11]. Additional
advantages of combining THU with decitabine are
