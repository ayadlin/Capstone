Abstract
p53 reactivation offers a broad-based strategy for cancer therapy. In this study, we report the identiﬁcation of
prodigiosin that can reactivate p53 family-dependent transcriptional activity in p53-deﬁcient human colon
cancer cells. Prodigiosin and its structural analogue (compound R) induced the expression of p53 target genes
accompanied by cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in p53-deﬁcient cancer cells. Prodigiosin restored p53 signaling in
cancer cells harboring hotspot TP53 mutations, with little to no detectable cytotoxicity in normal human
ﬁbroblasts and with no genotoxicity. Prodigiosin induced the expression of p73 and disrupted its interaction with
mutant p53, thereby rescuing p53 pathway deﬁciency and promoting antitumor effects. The disruption of mutant
p53/p73 interaction was speciﬁc to prodigiosin and not related to mTOR inhibition. Our ﬁndings suggest that
mutant p53 needs to be targeted in the context of p73 stimulation to allow efﬁcient restoration of the p53 pathway.
In exhibiting this capability, prodigiosin and its analogue provide lead compounds to rescue deﬁciencies in
the p53 pathway in cancer cells by upregulating p73 and targeting mutant p53/p73 interaction there. Cancer Res;

Introduction
The TP53 tumor suppressor is mutated in more than 50% of
human tumors (1, 2). p53 activation can induce cell-cycle arrest
and apoptosis through its transcriptional regulation of speciﬁc
target genes, such as p21, GADD45, BAX, NOXA, DR5 and PUMA
(3). Because of deﬁciencies in cell-cycle control and apoptosis,
functionally p53-deﬁcient cells are susceptible to malignant
transformation (4). It is well known that p53 knockout mice
develop spontaneous tumors (5). In clinical studies, TP53
mutation is associated with resistance to radiotherapy and
chemotherapy, poor patient survival, and tumor progression
(6, 7). Therefore, p53 pathway functional reactivation is an
attractive strategy for cancer therapy development and may
address an unmet need in the clinic for progressive therapyrefractory human tumors.

Although efforts have been devoted to searching for drugs
with the ability to rescue a mutant p53 pathway, no p53rescuing drugs have been approved for clinical use in the
United States (8). p53, as a transcription factor, is not an easy
drug target, because numerous mechanisms lead to p53 inactivation in human cancers, such as TP53 mutations, TP53
deletion, and the disruption of p53 degradation (8). Thousands
of TP53 mutations have been detected in human cancers and
so many different mutations could lead to different changes in
p53 structure and function although there are hotspots within
its DNA-binding domain (9). Therefore, p53 is not easily
targeted directly and alternative p53-targeting approaches
need to be developed.
p73, a p53 family protein, shares a high degree of sequence
homology with p53 and regulates the expression of similar
genes by binding to p53-responsive elements within gene
promoters and performs similar functions to p53 (10, 11).
However, unlike p53, p73 is not a target for mutational inactivation in human cancer (11). Recently, it has been found that
some agents induce cell death via the upregulation of p73,
including NSC176327 (12), securinine (13), and RETRA (14).
These studies indicate that these p73-inducing agents cause
cell death in a p53-like manner by activating p53-responsive
genes as well as inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, p73 function
has been shown to be inhibited by the interaction with mutant
p53 (15). The synthesized short peptides (short interfering
mutant p53 peptides; SIMP; ref. 16) and a small-molecule
RETRA (14) disrupt the interaction of mutant p53 and p73,
consequently leading to p73 release, p53 pathway activation,
and apoptosis induction. Therefore, p73 upregulation and
disruption of a mutant p53/p73 complex would be a promising

strategy to activate the p53 pathway and induce cancer cell
death.
Using a high-throughput drug screen, we identiﬁed prodigiosin and a structural analogue (Compound R) with p53
rescue activity in p53-mutant and p53-null cancer cells. We
found that prodigiosin and compound R inhibit tumor cell
growth at very low concentration (nmol/L range), and without
cytotoxicity toward normal cells. Furthermore, we found that
p73 upregulation is involved in the mechanism of p53 pathway
activation and apoptosis induction by prodigiosin and compound R. We also found that prodigiosin, but not the mTOR
inhibitor rapamycin, is able to disrupt the interaction of
mutant p53 and p73. Our study suggests that p73 could be a
useful alternative target to reactivate the p53 pathway in p53deﬁcient cancer cells.

at 4 C for overnight. After incubation, 50 mL of protein ASepharose beads was added, and the samples were rocked at
4 C for 4 hours and then washed three times. Samples were
resuspended in 20 mL of 2 sample buffer, boiled for 10
minutes, and centrifuged for 1 minute at 13,000 rpm followed
by SDS-PAGE to detect p73 and p53.
Immunoﬂuorescence
Cells were seeded in four-chamber slides. After treatment,
cells were ﬁxed by Cytoﬁx/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences) for 30
minutes. Fixed cells were blocked for 2 hours, followed by
primary antibody incubation for 2 hours and secondary antibody incubation for 2 hours at room temperature. After
washing, samples were stained with 40 , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 1 minute, mounted, and examined by ﬂuorescence
microscopy.

Materials and Methods
Cell-based p53 activity screening
Cell-based screening for p53-dependent transcriptional
activity was performed by using noninvasive bioluminescence
imaging. p53-mutant SW480 human colon cancer cells, stably
expressing a p53-responsive luciferase reporter, were used for
chemical library screening as previously described (17). Cells
were treated with small-molecule compounds from the
National Cancer Institute (NCI; Bethesda, MD) compound
library (The NCI/Developmental Therapeutics Program Open
Chemical Repository). After the treatment, cells were imaged
by using an IVIS Imaging System (Xenogen) to detect luciferase
activity. Positive hits with strong activity for luciferase induction were selected for the secondary screen. In the secondary
screen, the compounds were tested at concentrations ranging
from 0.01 to 10 mmol/L for 2, 20, and 72 hours in p53-mutant
human cancer cell lines SW480 (R273H and P309S) and DLD1
(S241F), as well as the p53-null HCT116 human cancer cell line.
Establishment of SW480 p53 reporter cell line with stable
p73 knockdown
The retroviral vector containing p73 siRNA (pSIREN-RetrolQ-p73 siRNA- blasticidin-retroviral vector) was described
previously (17). Phoenix cells were transfected with the retroviral vector containing p73 siRNA. After 48-hour transfection,
supernatant (packaged retrovirals) was collected, and then
infected SW480 p53 reporter containing cells (17). Blasticidin
at 5 mg/mL was added for selection. After 2 weeks of selection,
blasticidin-resistant cells were collected for p73 knockdown
(p73 KD) validation.
Western blotting
After treatment, protein lysates were collected for Western
blot analysis. Twenty-ﬁve micrograms of protein was used for
SDS-PAGE. After primary and secondary antibody incubations,
the signal was detected by chemiluminescent detection kit,
followed by autoradiography.
Immunoprecipitation of mutant p53 with p73
After treatment, cells were lysed with immunoprecipitation
lysis buffer. Five hundred micrograms of whole-cell extracts
were incubated with 1 mg of p53 antibody followed by rocking

Flow cytometry assay
After treatment, cells were harvested, ﬁxed by ethanol, and
stained by propidium iodide (PI), then ﬂow cytometry was
performed as previously described (17).
Cell viability assay
Cancer cells were treated with different concentrations of
prodigiosin or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control for 72
hours. The cell viability was assessed by CellTiterGlo bioluminescent cell proliferation assay (Promega). Percentage of
cell viability (meanSEM) at each dose was calculated against
the respective DMSO control. The IC50 values were determined from the sigmoidal dose–response curves using
PRISM4 software (GraphPad).
In vivo assay
Animal experiments were carried out according to a protocol approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Pennsylvania State University (State College, PA).
Athymic nude mice were injected subcutaneously in the left
and right dorsal ﬂank, each with a 100 mL suspension of 1 to
4106 cancer cells in an equal volume of Matrigel. When
tumors grew to 4 to 5 mm in diameter, the mice were treated
with the prodigiosin, compound R, or DMSO control by intraperitonel injection. p53 transcriptional activity was detected
using bioluminescence imaging at 5 minutes following intraperitoneal injection of 60 mL D-luciferin (50 mg/mL). The
induction of p53-responsive transcriptional activity was
obtained by the comparison of the luciferase activity after
12-hour treatment with that before treatment. The tumor size
was monitored by caliper measurements.
Xenograft tumor section analysis
Tumors were harvested from euthanized mice and ﬁxed in
4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 48 hours. Parafﬁn-embedding,
sectioning, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining were
performed by the Histology Core Facility at Penn State Hershey
Medical Center (Hershey, PA). Terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol
for ApopTag Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit

Rescuing Deﬁcient p53 via p73 in Cancers

(Millipore). For immunohistochemistry analysis, slides were
dewaxed in xylene, rehydrated in a decreasing gradient of
ethanol, and antigen retrieval was carried out by boiling in
10 mmol/L citric acid (pH 6.0) for 6 minutes. Samples were
blocked with goat serum (Vector Laboratories). Primary antibody for Ki67 (Immunotech, 0505) was incubated overnight at
4 C in a humidity chamber. Incubation with biotinylated
secondary antibody and 3,30 -diaminobenzidine (DAB) deposition was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol (Vector Laboratories DAB Substrate Kit for Peroxidase).
Samples were counterstained with hematoxylin (DAKO) for
6 minutes, rinsed in dH2O for 5 minutes, rinsed with PBS,
and dehydrated and sealed under cover slips. Images were
recorded on an Axioskop microscope using QCapture software
(QImaging).
Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed using PRISM4 Software (GraphPad
Software, Inc.,). Statistical analysis was performed using an
unpaired or paired t test. Results were considered as statistically signiﬁcant when P < 0.05.

Results
Prodigiosin and compound R can activate p53-like
transcriptional activity in p53-mutant and p53-null
human cancer cells
Using a mutant p53-expressing cancer cell line (SW480) with
a stably integrated p53-responsive luciferase reporter, we
sought to identify small molecules with p53 rescue activity by
screening of the NCI compound library. Our screening system
was previously established to identify small molecules that can
activate p53 family-speciﬁc transcriptional activity coupled to
loss of cell viability (17). In the screening, we identiﬁed prodigiosin, which can activate p53-like transcriptional activity in
SW480 cells. We have also identiﬁed a structurally related
analogue of prodigiosin (compound R) in the NCI library. The
structures of prodigiosin (P) and compound R (R) are shown
in Fig. 1A.
We validated prodigiosin (P) and compound R (R) in a
secondary screen. SW480, DLD1, and HCT116 p53/ cells
with p53 reporter were treated with different concentrations of
"P," "R," or DMSO control for 2, 20, and 72 hours. After
treatment, p53-responsive luciferase reporter activity was
imaged by an IVIS imaging system. As shown in Fig. 1B, "P"
or "R" activated p53-responsive reporter activity at early time
points (2 and 20 hours) in a dose-dependent manner. Following
at 72 hours, all cell lines exhibited the phenotypes of a dosedependent cell death by the treatment of either "P" or "R". These
data indicate that prodigiosin and compound R can activate
p53-responsive transcriptional activity in p53-mutant and p53null cancer cells.
To further validate that prodigiosin (P) and compound R (R)
can activate p53 signaling pathway in p53-mutant and p53-null
cancer cells, we examined whether "P" or "R" can induce the
expression of endogenous p53 target genes. Western blot
analysis indicated that "P" or "R" induced the expression of
p53 target genes (p21, DR5 and PUMA) in a dose-dependent
manner in SW480 and HCT116 p53/ cells (Fig. 1C). The data

demonstrate that p53-responsive signaling pathway is activated by prodigiosin and compound R in p53-mutant and p53-null
cancer cells.
In a panel of cancer cell lines with p53 hotspot mutants,
prodigiosin activates p53 pathway and induces cell death
Cancer cells harbor a variety of TP53 mutations, and there
are hotspot mutations occurring in DNA-binding domain. The
diversity of mutations promoted us to investigate whether
prodigiosin can active p53 pathway and induce cell death in
cancer cells containing different p53 hotspot mutants. To test
this, we selected a panel of cancer cell lines with p53 hotspot
mutants (Fig. 2), and treated these cells with prodigiosin. Cell
viability assay indicates that prodigiosin induces cell death in
all tested cancer cells with p53 hotspot mutants as well as
cancer cells with wild-type p53 and p53 null (Fig. 2A). Among
these p53-mutant cancer cells, SW480, DLD1, HT29, and
OVCAR3 cells are all sensitive to prodigiosin with very low
IC50 values, and PARP cleavage is also induced by prodigiosin in
these cancer cells. However, HOP92 and RFX393 cells are less
sensitive to prodigiosin with higher IC50 values, and PARP
cleavage is not induced in these two cancer cell lines (Fig. 2).
Prodigiosin induces DR5 and p21 in the sensitive cancer cell
lines (SW480, DLD1, HT29, and OVCAR3). In the less sensitive
cancer cell lines (HOP92 and RFX393), HOP92 cells are ﬁve
times more sensitive to prodigiosin than the RFX393 cells, but
show no induction of p21, whereas the RFX393 cells do (Fig. 2).
HOP92 cells have a higher level of apoptotic rate, as indicated
by the higher basal level of cleaved PARP (Fig. 2B). Therefore,
we consider that HOP92 cells could have undergone apoptosis
at the 12-hour treatment of prodigiosin, so the expression of
p21 (cell-cycle arrest marker) is reduced. We suspected that
p21 may be induced earlier than 12 hours in HOP92 cells and
performed a time course experiment. The data show that p21 is
induced by prodigiosin in HOP92 cell at the 4-hour time point.
As the time extends, p21 expression is decreased gradually by
the treatment of prodigiosin (Supplementary Fig. S1). Our
study suggests that prodigiosin is effective to reactivate the
p53 pathway and to induce apoptosis in cancer cells with
various p53 hotspot mutants.
Prodigiosin and compound R induce cell-cycle arrest
and apoptosis in cancer cells, and exhibit less
cytotoxicity toward normal cells at relatively low
concentration
Once the p53 pathway is activated, mammalian cells
respond by undergoing cell-cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. To
determine whether "P" or "R" induce cell-cycle arrest and/or
apoptosis following p53 pathway activation, we performed
ﬂow cytometric analysis and PARP cleavage analysis. The
cell-cycle analysis indicated that 1 mmol/L of "P" or "R" induces
G1 and/or G2 arrest at an early time point (12 hours) in SW480
and HCT116 p53/ cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). When the
cells were treated for a longer time (72 hours), 1 mmol/L of "P"
or "R" appeared to induce a remarkable sub-G1 peak (apoptotic
peak; Fig. 3A). Western blot analysis indicated that both "P" and
"R" induce obvious PARP cleavage (a marker of apoptosis
due to caspase activation) in SW480 and HCT116 p53/ cells

(Fig. 3B). DNA damage can activate p53 pathway to induce cellcycle arrest and/or apoptosis. To indicate that the p53 pathway
activation by prodigiosin and compound R is not due to DNA
damage, we detected the gH2AX expression after the treatment. Western blot analysis showed that "P" and "R" did not
induce gH2AX in SW480 cells and HCT116 p53/ cells at
lower doses required for p53 pathway activation as well as cellcycle arrest and apoptosis induction (Fig. 3C). By immunoﬂuorescence staining, we detected gH2AX foci. The data showed
that 1 mmol/L prodigiosin does not induce gH2AX foci formation after the 12-hour treatment. The chemotherapeutic agent
oxaliplatin (10 mg/mL) was used as the positive control, and
dramatically induced gH2AX foci in SW480 and HCT116
p53/ cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). These results indicate

1156

that the activation of the p53 pathway by prodigiosin or
compound R is accompanied by the induction of cell-cycle
arrest and apoptosis without genotoxic effects in p53-mutant
and p53-null cancer cells.
Under physiologic conditions, normal cells express very low
levels of p53 in the absence of stressful stimulation. To investigate the impact of activation of the p53 pathway by prodigiosin (P) or compound R (R) on normal cells, we compared the
effect of these two compounds on cellular apoptosis between
cancer and normal cells. As shown in Fig. 3D, 0.2 mmol/L of
either "P" or "R" did not appear to induce a sub-G1 phase
(apoptotic cells) following a 72-hour treatment in normal cells
(human foreskin ﬁbroblasts; HFF), however the same concentration of "P" or "R" induced a signiﬁcant increase in sub-G1

But we also found that the higher concentration (1 mmol/L) of
"P" or "R" moderately induces cellular apoptosis at 72 hours
treatment in HFF normal cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). We
performed cell viability assays and obtained a dose–response
curve of prodigiosin in cancer cells (SW480) and normal cells
(HFF; Supplementary Fig. S5). The dose–response curve
demonstrates that 1.11 mmol/L prodigiosin induces 83.90%
growth inhibition in SW480 cells and 76.16% growth inhibition
in HFF cells. However, at a lower dose (123 nmol/L), prodigiosin does not induce growth inhibition in HFF normal cells,

but dramatically induces growth inhibition in SW480 cancer
cells. The IC50 of prodigiosin in HFF normal cells is 476 nmol/L,
which is three to 10 times higher than the IC50 of cancer cell
lines, except for the RXF393 cancer cell line. In the curve, we
observed that there is a large gap between HFF and SW480 at
concentrations from 123 nmol/L to 1.11 mmol/L, which indicates that prodigiosin in the range of concentrations (100
nmol/L–1 mmol/L) induces preferential killing of cancer cells
as compared with normal cells (Supplementary Fig. S5). To
indicate the effect of prodigiosin on the p53 pathway in normal
cells, we treated normal cells HFF and MRC-5 (human lung

blotting indicates that at 12-hour treatment, 1 mmol/L prodigioin does not induce p21, and slightly induces DR5 expression
in normal cells (HFF and MRC-5); but DR5 and p21 are
dramatically induced in Fadu cancer cells, a p53-mutant head
and neck cancer cell line (Supplementary Fig. S6). The data
suggest that prodigiosin exhibits a preferential ability to induce
the p53 signaling pathway in cancer cells compared with
normal cells. These ﬁndings indicate that prodigiosin or compound R preferentially induce the death of cancer cells rather
than normal cells. This is an interesting and important observation, indicating there may be a therapeutic index for these
small molecules screened to restore signaling in the p53
pathway within mutant p53-expressing cancer cells.

The p53 family member p73 is involved in the mechanism
of p53 pathway restoration by prodigiosin or compound
R in p53-mutant and p53-null cancer cells
We observed that prodigiosin and compound R induce
p53-like transcriptional activity and its downstream genes in
p53-null cancer cells. p53 expression was not found to be
induced by prodigiosin in SW480 (p53 mutant) and HCT116
(p53 wild-type) cells, but p53 target proteins (DR5, p21, and
PUMA) were induced by prodigiosin in SW480 and HCT116
cells (Supplementary Fig. S7). These results suggest that prodigiosin and compound R can restore p53 transcriptional
responses in a p53-independent manner. p73, a p53 family
protein, can induce cell-cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in a p53like manner and recognizes the same genomic DNA-binding

responsive element as p53. Therefore, we hypothesized that
prodigiosin and compound R induce p73 expression to activate
p53 pathway signaling, leading to cellular apoptosis in p53deﬁcient cancer cells. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 4A, "P" or "R"
appear to induce p73 expression in mutant p53-expressing
SW480 and p53/ HCT116 cells. p73 expression is also
induced in p53 wild-type HCT116 cells (Supplementary Fig.
S7). p63 is another p53 family protein, which can functionally
replace p53. We examined the level of p63 when SW480 and
HCT116 p53/ cells were treated with prodigiosin. Western
blotting shows that prodigiosin does not induce p63, and even
decreases p63 level as concentrations increase in the SW480
and HCT116 p53/ cells (Supplementary Fig. S8). These data
suggest that among the p53 family members p53, p63, and p73,
prodigiosin is speciﬁc to p73 in restoring the p53 signaling
pathway.
To further conﬁrm that p73 plays a role in p53 pathway
activation and apoptosis induction by "P" or "R," we knocked
down p73 by using p73 short hairpin RNA and overexpressed
p73 by using p73-expressing adenovirus infection. When p73 is
stably knocked down in SW480 cells (Fig. 4B), we found that the
induction of p53-responsive transcriptional activity by "P" or
"R" is reduced in p73 knockdown SW480 cells, as compared
with parental SW480 cells (Fig. 4C). The sub-G1 analysis
demonstrates that "P" or "R" induces less apoptosis in SW480
cells with stable p73 knockdown than parental SW480 cells
(Fig. 4D). When p73 is overexpressed in either SW480 or
HCT116 p53/ cells (Fig. 4E), bioluminescence analysis indicates that the induction of p53-responsive transcriptional
activity by either "P" or "R" is enhanced (Fig. 4F). Crystal violet
staining demonstrates that p73 overexpression enhances prodigiosin-induced cell death (Fig. 4G). Together, these ﬁndings
indicate that p73 upregulation is involved in the mechanism of
p53 pathway activation and apoptosis induction by either
prodigiosin or compound R.
Prodigiosin disrupts the physical interaction between
mutant p53 and p73 independent of mTOR inhibition
Previous studies have shown that mutant p53 can interact
with p73 and abrogate p73 function (15). To indicate whether prodigiosin can disrupt the interaction of a mutant p53/
p73 complex, we performed an immunoprecipitation assay.
We observed that mutant p53 interacts with p73, and
prodigiosin treatment disrupts the interaction in SW480
cells (Fig. 5A).
Prodigiosin has been reported to be able to bind to mTOR
and inhibit mTOR activity (18). To determine whether
prodigiosin disrupts the interaction of mutant p53/p73
complex through mTOR inhibition, we treated SW480 cells
with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin to assess whether
mTOR inhibition can disrupt the interaction. As shown
in Fig. 5A, prodigiosin disrupts the physical interaction of
mutant p53 and p73, but rapamycin does not disrupt this
interaction. Western blot analysis conﬁrmed that both prodigiosin and rapamycin inhibit the mTOR pathway as indicated by the decrease of phospho-mTOR, phospho-p70 S6
kinase, and phospho-4E-BP1 when SW480 cells are treated
with either prodigiosin or rapamycin (Fig. 5B). To inhibit the

www.aacrjournals.org

mTOR pathway sufﬁciently, we also treated SW480 cells with
a higher concentration of rapamycin (100 nmol/L). We
compared the inhibition of the mTOR pathway between 1
mmol/L prodigiosin and 100 nmol/L rapamycin treatments.
Western blotting shows that 100 nmol/L rapamycin induces
a greater inhibition of p-mTOR and p-p70 S6 kinase as compared with 1 mmol/L prodigiosin. The inhibition of p-4E-BP1 is
same between prodigiosin and rapamycin treatments (Supplementary Fig. S9A). Then we performed the immunoprecipitation assay. The result shows that 100 nmol/L rapamycin still
does not disrupt the interaction of mutant p53/p73, but
prodigiosin does (Supplementary Fig. S9B). The result suggests
that prodigiosin disrupts the interaction of mutant p53/p73
complex independent of mTOR inhibition.
Prodigiosin induces p53-dependent transcriptional
activity and inhibits tumor growth in vivo in a
p73-dependent manner
To evaluate the antitumor efﬁcacy of prodigiosin (P) and
compound R (R) in vivo, we established a human tumor
xenograft model by subcutaneously injecting human colon
cancer cells into nude mice. Tumor-bearing mice were treated
with either "P" or "R" by intraperitoneal injection. We ﬁrst
investigated whether "P" or "R" could stimulate p53-responsive
transcriptional activity in living tumor xenografts (SW480
xenografts with p53 reporter and SW480 p73 knockdown
xenografts with p53 reporter). Before we performed the ﬁrst
drug treatment, we detected the baseline luciferase activity
(p53-responsive transcriptional activity) by bioluminescence
imaging. After 12 hours of DMSO, "P," or "R" treatment, the
luciferase activity was detected again. As shown in Fig. 6, either
"P" or "R" treatment signiﬁcantly increases p53-responsive
transcriptional activity as compared with DMSO treatment in
SW480 xenografts, moreover the induction of p53-responsive
transcriptional activity by either "P" or "R" treatment appears to
be signiﬁcantly reduced in SW480 xenografts with stable p73
knockdown. The in vivo results are consistent with our earlier
in vitro results that show either prodigiosin or compound R
induce less p53-responsive transcriptional activity in SW480
cell with stable p73 knockdown as compared with the parental
SW480 cells.
The antitumor efﬁcacy of "P" and "R" was evaluated in vivo by
measuring tumor volumes. In SW480 xenografts, tumor volume in prodigiosin-treated mice appeared to be signiﬁcantly
reduced as compared with the DMSO-treated mice (Fig. 7A and
B). However, compound R appears to be toxic due to unknown
reasons. Three mice (from the total of eight mice in the "R"treated group) died after the second drug treatment. For
compound R treatment, there was no signiﬁcant antitumor
growth effect observed at the end of the experiment (Fig. 7A
and B). Importantly, we found that tumor growth of SW480 p73
knockdown xenografts is enhanced as compared with SW480
xenografts (Fig. 7A and B). Prodigiosin or compound R do not
reduce tumor growth in SW480 p73 knockdown xenografts
(Fig. 7A and B). An additional human colon tumor xenograft,
HT29 xenograft (p53-mutant R273H), was also used to test
the antitumor efﬁcacy of prodigiosin. As shown in Fig. 7C and
7D, prodigiosin signiﬁcantly inhibits tumor growth of HT29

staining of tumor sections revealed that prodigiosin treatment
decreases tumor cell density (Fig. 7E). The tumor cell density is
also reduced at the invasive front of the tumor upon prodigiosin treatment as compared with DMSO treatment (Fig. 7E).
Ki67 expression was found to be signiﬁcantly decreased in
prodigiosin-treated tumors as compared with DMSO-treated
tumors (Fig. 7F and Supplementary Fig. S10), whereas apoptosis (TUNEL staining) is signiﬁcantly increased in the same

difference in body weight was observed between DMSO control
group and prodigiosin treatment group (Supplementary Fig.
S11). The results indicate that prodigiosin inhibits tumor
growth and that the antitumor effect of prodigiosin is associated with p73 expression and requires p73 in the mouse
xenograft model.

Discussion
Rescue of deﬁcient p53 function is an attractive strategy for
cancer therapy. However, p53 is not an easy drug target due to
many different mechanisms that result in its deﬁciency. An

www.aacrjournals.org

ideal compound for functional p53 rescue therapy is the one
that can rescue the p53 pathway by overcoming different
mechanisms of p53 loss of function in p53-deﬁcient cancer
cells. In our study, we discovered that either prodigiosin or
compound R can rescue p53 signaling pathway and induce
tumor cell death in mutant p53-expressing or p53-null cancer
cells. Our data also show that prodigiosin possess the capability
of p53 pathway activation as well as apoptosis induction in a
panel of cancer cell lines with TP53 hotspot mutations. Therefore, our study suggests prodigiosin or its structural analogues
as candidates for p53 rescue-based drug development, regardless of p53 deﬁciency status. Because p53 has been a challenge
to target directly by small molecules, several advantages make
p73 an alternative target (8). First, p73 is expressed in tumor
cells and is almost never mutated. Second, p73 induces cellcycle arrest and/or apoptosis in p53-like manner. Third, p73
can rescue the p53 pathway in various p53-deﬁcient cancer
cells. Our data indicate that both prodigiosin and compound R
upregulate p73 expression. p73 is required for the restoration of
p53 signaling as well as observed in vitro and in vivo antitumor
effects of either prodigiosin or compound R. Our study suggests
that p73 induction could rescue p53 inactivation in almost all

p73 activity has been shown to be inhibited by mutant p53 in
cancer cells (15). Thus, although p73 expression is upregulated
by prodigiosin, it is likely that the increased p73 is inhibited by
interacting with the overexpressed mutant p53 in cancer cells.
Our study indicates that prodigiosin not only upregulates p73,
but also prevents p73 from interacting with mutant p53.
Therefore, the dual effects of prodigiosin make it a very
promising candidate in anticancer drug development. Prodigiosin has been demonstrated to be able to inhibit mTOR
activity (18), and a previous study has indicated that mTOR
inhibition can upregulate p73 (19). Therefore, it is possible that
in our study, prodigiosin may have upregulated p73 through
mTOR inhibition. However, it is interesting and uniquely
important that mTOR inhibition by rapamycin does not dis-

rupt the physical association between mutant p53 and p73,
whereas prodigiosin efﬁciently disrupts this p53 pathway
inhibitory interaction. Our study demonstrates that prodigiosin targets p73 by dual effects (upregulation of p73 expression
and disruption of mutant p53/p73 interaction); however a
pure mTOR inhibitor rapamycin targets p73 only by upregulation of its expression. Our study implies that p73 upregulation by mTOR inhibition may not have a potent antitumor effect in p53-mutant cancers, as overexpressed
mutant p53 would be expected to inhibit p73 function by
protein–protein interaction.
Compared with other agents that disrupt the interaction of
mutant p53 and p73, such as SIMPs (16) and RETRA (14),
prodigiosin has an advantage because of its dual effects. SIMPs
and RETRA target p73 only by disrupting its interaction with
mutant p53, and therefore they are only effective in p53-mutant

A major desirable characteristic of any potential anticancer
drug is that it preferentially kills cancer cells leaving normal
cells unaffected. Our study clearly shows that relatively low
concentrations of prodigiosin or compound R do not induce
cell death of normal cells in culture, while causing signiﬁcant
cell death of cancer cells. Our study is consistent with previous
studies that reported a lack of toxicity of prodigiosin to normal
cells. Montaner and colleagues reported that prodigiosin
induces apoptosis in hematopoietic cancer cells with no
marked toxicity in nonmalignant cells (20). Yamamoto and
colleagues reported that a prodigiosin derivative, cycloprodigiosin hydrochloride, inhibits the growth of liver cancer cells
with very low IC50, while it does not inhibit the growth of
isolated normal rat hepatocytes (21). Therefore, these published data together with our present results suggest that
prodigiosin is a highly potent inhibitor of cancer cells with
no marked toxicity toward normal cells at relatively low doses.
It is important to note that no prior study has linked p53 or p73
to the mechanism of action of either prodigiosin or its related
structures, and no prior study has demonstrated the ability of
these compounds to restore p53 pathway signaling in mutant
p53-expressing or p53-null cancer cells.
We further investigated the effect of prodigiosin and compound R on tumor growth in vivo. We found that p53-responsive transcriptional activity is activated by prodigiosin and
compound R in vivo. Prodigiosin treatment at very low dose (5
mg/kg) effectively suppresses tumor growth. Yamamoto and
colleagues has reported that a prodigiosin derivative, cycloprodigiosin hydrochloride, signiﬁcantly inhibits the growth of
xenografted Huh-7 liver cancer cells at 1 or 10 mg/kg concentrations (21). Our result shows that compound R is toxic in a
mouse model, although it does not kill normal cell in vitro. It is
possible that the in vivo toxicity of compound R may be due to a
modiﬁcation of the structure. Importantly, our in vivo experiments reveal that SW480 xenografts with stable p73 knockdown grow faster than SW480 xenografts. SW480 xenografts
with stable p73 knockdown are also resistant to prodigiosin,
suggesting that p73 downregulation enhances tumorigenesis
and confers resistance to prodigiosin. A synthetic prodigiosin
derivative, GX15-070 (Obatoclax), has been in phase I and II
clinical trials to treat various types of cancers through a
mechanism unrelated to the p53 pathway, and we have not
evaluated Obatoclax in our experiments (22). Therefore, pro-

digiosin and its structural analogues have potential for further
clinical development based on our reported ﬁndings.
We conclude that prodigiosin rescues a deﬁcient p53 signaling pathway and induces antitumor effects via a dual
mechanism involving p73 upregulation and disruption of the
mutant p53/p73 complex. Our study suggests that p73 is a
viable and potent alternative target to reactivate the p53
pathway in p53-deﬁcient cancers. We hypothesize that in
mutant p53-expressing tumors, it will be necessary to target
mutant p53 as an important component of strategies aimed at
stimulation of p73 to restore p53 pathway signaling and to
achieve potent antitumor effects. Prodigiosin could serve as a
promising lead compound for the development of anticancer
drugs that rescue p53 activity through multiple effects on the
complex p53 network, and offer a therapeutic index with
demonstrated in vivo antitumor effects.
