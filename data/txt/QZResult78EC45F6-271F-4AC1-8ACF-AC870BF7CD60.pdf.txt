ABSTRACT
Mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome (MC) is a systemic vasculitis involving kidneys,
joints, skin, and peripheral nerves. While many autoimmune, lymphoproliferative,
and neoplastic disorders have been associated with this disorder, hepatitis C virus
(HCV) is known to be the etiologic agent in the majority of patients. Therefore, clinical
research has focused on anti-viral drugs and, more recently, on the new, highly
potent Direct-acting Antiviral Agents (DAAs). These drugs assure sustained virologic
response (SVR) rates >90%. Nevertheless, data on their efficacy in patients with HCVassociated cryoglobulinemic vasculitis are disappointing, possibly due to the inability
of the drugs to suppress the immune-mediated process once it has been triggered.
Despite the potential risk of exacerbation of the infection, immunosuppression
has traditionally been regarded as the first-line intervention in cryoglobulinemic
vasculitis, especially if renal involvement is severe. Biologic agents have raised
hopes for more manageable therapeutic approaches, and Rituximab (RTX), an anti
CD20 monoclonal antibody, is the most widely used biologic drug. It has proved to
be safer than conventional immunosuppressants, thus substantially changing the
natural history of HCV-associated cryoglobulinemic vasculitis by providing long-term
remission, especially with intensive regimens.
The present review focuses on the new therapeutic opportunities offered by the
combination of biological drugs, mainly Rituximab, with DAAs.

INTRODUCTION

consisting either of a monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig),
usually an IgM-k, plus a polyclonal Ig-k or lambda (type
II cryoglobulins), or two polyclonal Igs (type III). In a
considerable number of patients previously classified as
type III the more advanced immunofixation techniques
allow recognition of an intermediate clonal restriction in
which an oligoclonal Ig is complexed with a polyclonal Ig
type (type II/III cryoglobulins) [1].
Most of the cases that were previously described
as “idiopathic or essential” are now associated with

Mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome (MC) is an
idiopathic or secondary vasculitis characterised by the
presence of mixed cryoglobulins in the circulation,
and deposition in target organs. MC may be associated
with several conditions including chronic infections,
lymphoproliferative disorders, connective tissue diseases,
or non-infectious hepatobiliary conditions. Mixed
cryoglobulins are cryoprecipitable immune complexes

the presence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection [27]. Circulating (usually asymptomatic) cryoglobulins
are detectable in up to 40% of patients with chronic
hepatitis C. A specific cryoglobulinemic syndrome
occurs in a minority of cases (1-2%) [1]. Long-term HCV
infection, older age and genetic background all represent
predisposing factors for the development of MC [1,8,9].
Renal manifestations involve only 0.1-0.2% of
HCV-infected, but the presence of glomerulonephritis is a
major long-term prognostic factor for MC.

and monocytes [10]. More specifically, HCV-RNA, HCV
NS3 and core proteins have been restrictively found
in CD19-positive B cells [11]. HCV-persistent viral
stimulation enhances the expression of lymphomagenesisrelated genes and may induce a poly- and subsequently
monoclonal expansion of B-cells [12]. Under this trigger
effect, permanent clones of B-lymphocytes produce
oligo- or monoclonal IgM that are known to display
rheumatoid factor activity, favouring the formation of
immune-complexes (ICs) formed by the monoclonal IgM
itself, HCV, and anti-HCV polyclonal IgG antibodies.
The erythrocyte transport system does not recognize the
cryoprecipitable ICs because of the clonally restricted IgM
[13]. Therefore, these ICs escape the splenic and hepatic
macrophage removal system [14]. Similarly, monocytes
accumulating in the glomeruli of patients with MC are

of MC-membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis,
macrophage depletion protects animals from

macrophage-driving mesangial expansion and activation
are sustained by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines
and pro-cathepsin D from damage-associated molecular
patterns-activated macrophages (Table 1) [16].

organised in curved, short, thick-walled tubular structures
(diameter of about 30 nm) which appear circular on cross
sections (Figure 1).
It must be emphasised that the same clinical weight
cannot be assigned to all histological patterns. Thus, the
results of clinical studies which are not based on a careful
histological examination should be evaluated with caution.

and central nervous system involvement), was used as
parameter of poor outcome, and results were confirmed
by multivariate analysis [20]. Similarly, severe fibrosis
(HR 10.8) negatively impacted overall survival [20].
In a large, multicenter study on HCV-related MC, our
group demonstrated that significant prognostic variables
affecting the outcome of therapy included male gender,
age, proteinuria and creatinine assessed at renal biopsy,
the number of relapses, and poor blood pressure control
[1]. Basal creatinine values >1.5 mg/dL (133 μmol/L)
significantly impacted on survival as shown by KaplanMeier curves analysis. Cardiovascular disease was found
to be the cause of death in over 60% of cases [1].
In a survey from the French CryoVas study, Terrier
at al. [21] observed that purpura [HR 3.35 (1.02-10.97)],
cutaneous necrosis [HR 4.46 (1.58-12.57)] and articular
involvement [HR 2.20 (1.00-4.78)] were significantly
associated with early relapse.

Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis bears significant
morbidity and mortality. Renal involvement has
traditionally been considered one of the worst prognostic
factor [18]. More recently, Terrier and co-workers showed
that the 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year survival rates
in HCV-positive patients with MC-vasculitis were 96%,
86%, 75%, and 63%, respectively [19]. Severe infections
and end-stage liver disease were the main determinants of
fatal events. Baseline parameters associated with a poor
prognosis included the presence of severe liver fibrosis
(Metavir fibrosis score ≥ 3; hazard ratio [HR] 5.31), heart
involvement (HR 4.2), CNS involvement (HR 2.74), and
renal involvement (HR 1.91) [19]. The Five-Factor Score

inhibit the polymerase binding to viral RNA [23] and to
significantly reduce viremia within months.

revealed a significant improvement in cryoglobulinemic
nephropathy, and furthermore, cryoglobulinemic
serological parameters, such as low complement C4
and cryocrit also improved. No major side effects were
reported. Re-induction with Rituximab was carried out in
9 relapsing patients after a mean of 31.1 months (12-54),
resulting again effective. After 6 years of follow-up, the
survival rate was 75% and the probability of remaining
symptom-free for 10 years without any therapy was
approximately 60% after a single “4 plus 2” infusion
cycle, while the likelihood of living symptom-free for
5 years after relapse was 80% if treated with the same
protocol. Six patients in this study (mean age 75.3 yrs.)
died of cardiovascular causes a median of 55 months after
their RTX cicle [46]. This open, prospective study showed
Rituximab to be safe and effective for treating the most
severe cases of MC, even in a very long-term perspective
(6 years).
In order to evaluate the available data regarding
the use of Rituximab in cryoglobulinemic vasculitis with
a particular focus on cryoglobulinemic nephropathy,
we searched MEDLINE and EMBASE using the terms
“rituximab” and “cryoglobulinemia” in publications
between January 1, 1999, to April 1, 2016. Studies were
included if they were randomised, controlled studies
(RCT) or case series with more than 10 adult patients.
Studies were excluded 1. if they were reviews or expert
comments or case series with fewer than 10 patients;
2. if the main outcome was not clinical, and 3. if they
were published in abstract form alone. When several
publications involving­the same group of patients were
found, only the most recent and comprehensive paper
was considered unless the publication was derived from
another patient cohort or if the number of included patients
was significantly higher.
Among the 233 identified publications, 19
studies met the inclusion criteria, with 16 open-label
trials [22-37] and 3 RCTs [38-40]. Selected items were
systematically searched for in each paper, i.e., the number
of included patients, duration of follow-up, indication
for treatment with Rituximab and dosage, concomitant
immunosuppressive treatment, corticosteroid dosage and
clinical and biological outcomes.
Sixteen open-label trials [22-37], each of which
having at least 10 patients with cryoglobulinemia treated
with Rituximab, met the inclusion criteria. Data from a
total of 440 patients were retrieved. The main indications
for treatment with Rituximab were skin involvement (skin
vasculitis, purpura and/or skin ulcers) (N=272, 62%),
neuropathy (N=254, 58%), and nephropathy (N=143,
33%). Patients received varying doses of Rituximab
(2 × 1 g, 4 × 375 mg/m2, 4 +2 × 375 mg/m2 or 2 ×375 mg/
m2), as shown in Table 3. Median complete remission
(CR) was 68%, partial remission (PR) was 14%, and no
response was 10%, respectively.
A further analysis was carried out on case series

Mixed cryoglobulinemia as a unique pathologic
condition supporting the therapeutic use of the
anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody Rituximab
Of the many biologic agents that have shown
promising results in the management of patients with
severe vasculitis Rituximab (RTX) is the one that has been
used extensively to treat mixed cryoglobulinemia [25-40].
Rituximab is a humanised chimeric mouse
monoclonal antibody directed at the lymphocyte
membrane protein CD20, and it selectively depletes the
CD20+ B lymphocytes, thereby abolishing IgM production
and new cryoglobulin formation. It is noteworthy that
HCV proteins and RNA have been restrictively detected
in these cells [11]. Presently, more than 400 Rituximabtreated patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia have
been reported in the literature. Table 3 summarises the
published literature regarding the use of Rituximab
in MC. Briefly, Rituximab has been efficacious in the
management of the clinical manifestations of MC. Of
note, it improved skin ulcers, renal manifestations in 7590% of cases (usually within three months), and sensitivemotor neuropathy in 70% of cases. Our group also showed
that mixed peripheral neuropathy improved within 5
months after administering Rituximab [32]. Moreover,
Rituximab treatment has been found to deplete bone
marrow B-cell clonal expansion resulting in a decrease
of serum cryoglobulins and rheumatoid factor, and in a
normalisation of C4 levels [41-45].
We recently carried out a very long term
prospective (mean follow-up 72.47 months), singlecenter open study and evaluated the very long-term
effects of Rituximab administration in patients with
severe cryoglobulinemic vasculitis [46]. Rituximab
was given to 31 patients (27 HCV+ve) with mixed
cryoglobulinemia (type II in 29 subjects and type III in
2) and diffuse membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis
(16 cases), sensitive-motor neuropathy (26 cases) and
severe skin ulcers (7 cases). Rituximab was given at a
dose of 375 mg/m2 (days 1, 8, 15 and 22, followed by 2
more doses 1 and 2 months later, the so-called “4 plus 2
protocol”). Five patients also received 3 pulses of 500 mg
of methylprednisolone. No other immunosuppressive or
antiviral drugs were added. We found complete remission
of pre-treatment active manifestations in all cases of
purpuric lesions and non-healing vasculitic ulcers (Figure
2), and in 80% of the peripheral neuropathies. Followup after the second month of Rituximab administration

reporting renal outcomes [23-27,30,32-36] (Table 3).
These trials included 143 patients, but only a minority
had biopsy-proven evidence of cryoglobulinemic
glomerulonephritis. Median rates of renal CR and PR
and no response to Rituximab in patients with renal
involvement in cryoglobulinemia were 57%, 20% and
40%, respectively. Outcomes (overall and renal CR+PR)
were defined according to the definitions of each study.
Three RCTs were retrieved [38-40]. In 2010,
Dammacco and co-workers [38] investigated the safety
and efficacy of a combined use of pegylated interferon-α
and ribavirin (RBV), with or without Rituximab, in HCVrelated MC. Twenty-two patients with HCV-related MC
received pegylated interferon-α (2a: 180 μg or 2b: 1.5μ
/kg) weekly plus ribavirin (1,000 or 1,200 mg) daily for
48 weeks, and Rituximab (375 mg/m2) once a week for 1
month followed by two 5-monthly infusions [38]. Fifteen
additional patients received pegylated interferon-αI and
ribavirin with the same modalities, but without Rituximab.
CR was achieved in 54.5% (12/22) and in 33.3% (5/15)
of patients who received Rituximab and pegylated
interferon-α and ribavirin, respectively (p< 0.05), showing
that as an add-on to antiviral therapy, Rituximab was well
tolerated and more effective than pegylated interferon-α/
ribavirin alone in HCV-related MC.
A prospective RCT investigating the use of
Rituximab therapy in patients with severe MC was carried
out by De Vita and colleagues [40]. Fifty-nine patients
with MC were randomized to the non-Rituximab group
(receiving conventional treatment consisting of 1 of the
following 3 options: glucocorticoids; azathioprine or
(cyclophosphamide; plasmapheresis) or to the Rituximab
group receiving 2 infusions of 1 g each and lowering
the glucocorticoid dosage when possible, and with a
second course of Rituximab at relapse) [40]. Rituximab
appeared to be the best therapy for all 3 target-organ
manifestations (skin ulcers, active glomerulonephritis, or
refractory peripheral neuropathy). The median duration
of response to Rituximab was 18 months. The number
of patients who achieved the primary endpoint (survival
of treatment, defined as the proportion of patients who
continued taking their initial therapy), was statistically
higher in the Rituximab group at 1 year (64.3% versus
3.5%, p<0.0001), as well as at 2 years (60.7% versus
3.5%, p<0.0001).
In the same year, Sneller and co-workers [39]
published the results of a single-center, open label, RCT.
Rituximab (375 mg/ m2/week for 4 weeks) was compared
to the best available therapy in patients affected by HCVassociated cryoglobulinemic vasculitis in whom antiviral
was not effective. Sneller’s group enrolled 24 patients (12
in each treatment group). Six months after the beginning
of the treatment ten patients in the rituximab group
(83%) and 1 patient in the control group (8%) were in
remission (p< 0.001). The median duration of remission
for Rituximab-treated patients who reached the remission
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

within 6 months was 7 months. Moreover, Sneller’s group
did not observe any adverse effects of Rituximab on HCV
viremia or on the liver.
When focusing on the renal clinical outcome, our
review of the literature showed a very heterogeneous
response to Rituximab. Our recently published study,
which represents the largest single-center cohort of
patients with MC and renal involvement prospectively
treated with Rituximab [41] , showed a greater than 90%
rate of any response (CR+PR) at the end of follow-up.
We retrieved 11 studies with reported renal
outcomes. The median complete response rate was
57% (vs. 75% in our cohort). It may be speculated that
the “4 plus 2 (improved) protocol might intensify the
depleting effect of Rituximab on lymphocytes when
compared to other Rituximab regimens, thus maintaining
more prolonged B-cell depletion and improving clinical
outcome [45].
MC is an immune-mediated process that becomes
independent from the triggering virus. Rituximab is much
more selective than conventional immunosuppressive
treatments at interfering with the downstream processes
following the disease trigger [41-43], and is definitely
safer, as shown in Figure 3 which summarises the data
of HCV RNA serum load after Rituximab administration
in our cohort of 31 patients with severe mixed
cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. Moreover, MC-associated
nephritis exemplifies a unique condition of immunemediated conditions in which Rituximab specifically
targets the nephrotoxic Ig-producing cells, potentially
inducing a lymphocyte subpopulation re-assessment
(Figure 4).

ANTI-VIRAL THERAPY: THE POTENTIAL
ROLE OF DIRECT ANTIVIRAL AGENTS
For more than a decade chronic HCV infection
was mainly treated with pegylated interferon (PegIFN)
associated with RBV, even though this regimen was poorly
tolerated [44]. PegIFN/RBV therapy achieved eradication
of infection in fewer than 50% of naıve patients with
genotype 1 infection [44,45].
With
regard
to
HCV-associated
mixed
cryoglobulinemia-associated vasculitis, PegIFN/RBV
therapy was found to be most effective when combined
with Rituximab. In a pilot study, Saadoun et al. treated
16 consecutive, unselected refractory HCV-MC patients
with RTX followed by antiviral therapy with Peg-IFN
and RBV. Fifteen out of 16 patients showed clinical
improvement with an acceptable safety profile [46]. In
2010, Dammacco et al. and Saadoun et al. published two
studies on the use of RTX with Peg-IFN+RBV according
to a combined [38] or sequential [30] scheme, respectively.
In these and other studies[30,31,38,47], combined therapy
with RTX plus Peg-IFN+RBV resulted in better clinical
response and higher cryoglobulin clearance than Peg41772

IFN+RBV alone. This could be due to the combination of
cooperating mechanisms: viral eradication and depletion
of the pathological B-cell clones. Furthermore, the clinical
improvement obtained by adding RTX treatment could
make patients who were previously non-eligible for antiviral therapy now eligible for treatment.
A better understanding of the HCV genome and
structures paved the way for the development of directacting antiviral agents (DAAs). Telaprevir and boceprevir
were the first DAAs introduced in the clinical practice.
Adding these protease inhibitors to PegIFN/RBV in
naıve patients increased the rate of viral eradication to
approximately 70% [48,49]; however, PegIFN/RBV is still
needed since the use of DAAs as monotherapy may cause
viral resistance [50,51]. With regard to HCV-associated
mixed cryoglobulinemia with vasculitis, the combination
of PegIFNalfa/ribavirin/protease inhibitor proved to be
more effective than PegIFNalfa/ribavirin alone [52].
The new DAAs showed significant antiviral efficacy
(>90% cure) and a good tolerance profile. Years of
research have resulted in a very detailed understanding
of the viral life-cycle of HCV, leading to new therapeutic
strategies. HCV-RNA is bound by the translational
machinery of the host cell to the viral internal ribosome
entry site. Once internalized, the viral protein is processed
into 3 structural and 7 nonstructural (NS) proteins [58].
The new drugs target the 3 nonstructural proteins: NS5A
and NS5B RNA polymerase, the NS3 serine protease and
its cofactor, NS4A. Telaprevir and Boceprevir represent
the first-generation NS3/4A protease inhibitors but were
approved for use only in combination with PegIFN/
RBV. Asunaprevir, paritaprevir and simeprevir are
newly available DAAs. These inhibitors have improved
pharmacologic profiles with fewer administrations and
better tolerability. Despite the actual role of NS5A is
still debated, this structure seems to be involved into
the mechanism of viral replication and assembly [59].
Daclatasvir was the first NS5A inhibitor to be launched,
[60], followed by ledipasvir [61] and ombitasvir [62].
Overall, these DAAs are effective against a wide spectrum
of HCV genotypes [59]. However, those agents have a
relatively low resistance threshold. Thus, to minimise the
emergence of resistance mutations, their combined use is
recommended. Two classes of NS5B inhibitors have been
developed: nucleoside and nonnucleoside inhibitors. The
nucleoside inhibitors have a particularly high thresholds
to resistance due to variants in the active site, which is
highly preserved across HCV genotypes, leading to a pangenotypic activity to DAAs [63]. To date, sofosbuvir is
the most advanced DAAs: initially approved to be used
in association with RBV for HCV infection (genotypes 2
and 3), it is now the first all-oral, PegIFN-free regimen.
Subsequenlty, sofosbuvir was approved for a combined
use with simeprevir (NS3/4A serine protease inhibitor)
or with ledipasvir (NS5A inhibitor). Beclabuvir and
dasabuvir are non-nucleoside inhibitors of NS5B which
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

recognize sites other than the active site and interfere with
HCV viral elongation [64-66].
Multidrug regimens are combinations of an NS3/4A
inhibitor, an NS5A inhibitor and a non-nucleoside NS5A
inhibitor. A full 3D treatment regimen achieves an SVR
rate of >95 percent when administered for 12 weeks to
naıve patients, and >90 in prior non-responders.
DAAs are expected to modify both the incidence
of vasculitis resulting from a prolonged history of HCV
infection and the therapeutic algorithms in the early stages
of the disease. However, these agents do not possess the
immunomodulatory effects of the interferons. They likely
do not interfere with the pathogenesis of MC vasculitis
nor effectively impact on the development of the immunemediated injury once the immune disorder is established.
Besides, the uncertainty of their pharmacokinetics and
safety in the presence of renal impairment requires some
caution in their use in nephritic patients.
Limited evidence is currently available investigating
the treatment with DAAs in patients with HCV-related
MC [52-55], and results are difficult to interpret [56,57].
Makara[58] described the remission of multiorgan
involvement and withdrawal of serum cryoglobulins
after initiating DAA therapy as early as 4 weeks in a 40year old man with severe hepatitis C virus-associated
cryoglobulinemia treated for 12 weeks with ombitasvir/
paritaprevir/ritonavir, dasabuvir and ribavirin. However,
this patient had received 1,600 mg of Rituximab in
four doses 5 months earlier. Rituximab probably
contributed to the favourable response, in particular on
the polyneuropathy which is known to require at least 6-9
months to partially revert [29]. Details on the response
profile of proteinuria were not available in that study. Sise
at al. [56] showed that at 12 weeks patients with HCV-MC
associated vasculitis had sustained virological response
rate of 83% (10 out of 12 patients) for sofosbuvirbased DAA regimens. These findings were statistically
significantly higher than the historical control groups,
which underwent treatment with pegylated interferon
and ribavirin. The patients with glomerulonephritis (7
out of 12) who were treated with DAA therapy showed
a reduction in proteinuria and, concomitanly, an eGFR
improvement. The reduction in proteinuria was particularly
evident in the patients with a recent onset of proteinuria.
However, by examining the paper in detail, it should be
emphasised that during follow-up only 2 patients had a
substantial amelioration of serum creatinine (one who
was concomitantly treated with Rituximab and one who
only had a clinical diagnosis because no biopsy had been
performed). Changes were negligible in 4 patients, while
serum creatinine increased over time in the remaining
patient. About urinary abnormalities, the only patient who
had nephrotic range proteinuria at baseline (and showed
a decrease to non-nephrotic values) received Rituximab
together with the DAAs. Another patient who showed
a moderate reduction of proteinuria (from 1,574 to 800
41773

Oncotarget

mg/g sCr) was concomitantly treated with ustekinumab,
an anti IL-12-23 monoclonal antibody, whose effects in
proteinuric patients is presently unknown. Proteinuria
decreased from 2,141 to 400 mg/g sCr in a patient who
had not undergone biopsy. Of the remaining 4 patients,
proteinuria was negative in one case, not determined in
another, and only determined by urinalysis (1 and 3+,
respectively) in 2 cases.
Sollima et al.[59] treated 7 consecutive patients
with HCV-associated mixed cryoglobulinemia vasculitis
with new DAAs within an expanded access program.
The patients showed a broad range of manifestations,
including severe arthralgias, extensive purpura, peripheral
neuropathy, skin ulcers and nephropathy. Nephropathy was
the most frequent manifestation, presenting as a severe
nephrotic syndrome, stages III-IV chronic kidney disease
or both. Patients were treated with a variety of IFN-free
DAA regimens, including ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir
and dasabuvir, sofosbuvir plus ribavirin, sofosbuvir plus
daclatasvir and sofosbuvir plus simeprevir, depending
on HCV genotypes. Treatment was given for 12 weeks
in five cases and 24 weeks in two. All patients achieved
SVR at post-treatment week 12 (confirmed at week 24 in
five of them, on a longer follow-up). Serum cryoglobulins
were undetectable in 4 patients at the end of treatment
but increased again in three during follow-up. At posttreatment week 12, clinical response was observed in only
2 patients. Specifically, the response was partial in one
patient and complete in another who experienced vasculitis
relapse despite HCV RNA still being undetectable.
Thus, SVR to IFN-free antiviral therapy in severe HCVassociated mixed cryoglobulinemia patients may lead to
no clinical improvement.
Cornella and coworkers [57] described a case
series of 5 patients with genotype 1 chronic HCV-related
hepatitis complicated by MC who received 24 weeks’
triple therapy with oral antiviral agents (boceprivir
or telaprivir and sofosbuvir). Clearance of serum
cryoglobulins was not present in any of these patients.
Notably, a complete remission of MC associated
with sustained virological response following a combined
Peg-IFN+RBV+DAA (boceprevir)+Rituximab regimen
was described by Urraro et al.[60].
Taken together these observations emphasise the
role of DAAs in eradicating HCV infection even in mixed
cryoglobulinemia patients, a subset that is less responsive
to conventional antiviral treatment with Peg-IFN/RBV.
However, more studies are needed to establish the ideal
protocol and duration of therapy with DAAs for chronic
HCV and coincident mixed cryoglobulinemia.
Meanwhile, interest in Rituximab therapy in the
most severe patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia
remains unchanged. Besides its immunomodulatory effect,
Rituximab also plays an important role by depleting CD19
positive-B cells, known to be HCV reservoirs. Improving
the effects on vasculitis treatment and HCV eradication
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

using a combination of DAAs and Rituximab can be
envisaged.

THERAPIES TARGETING ALTERNATIVE
PATHWAYS
The use of other drugs, including thalidomide
[61,62], lenalinomide [63], and bortezomib-based
regimens [64, 65], may be useful in patients with type I
cryoglobulinemia. Some anecdotal case reports describe
successful approaches with abatacept [41] or tocilizumab
[66]. B-cell activating factor (BAFF) blocking agents
[67] and interleukin-2 agonists [68] may be promising
future therapies. Again, the combination of these agents
with DAAs could lead to parallel control of the vasculitic
process and eradication of the viral trigger.
