ABSTRACT
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive form of breast cancer for
which there is no effective treatment. Previously, we and others demonstrated that
CXCR4 surface expression is an independent prognostic factor for disease relapse and
survival in breast cancer. In this study, we investigated the effects of CXCR4 gene
silencing on cisplatin chemosensitivity in human triple-negative breast cancer cell
lines. We found that CXCR4 silencing significantly inhibited cell growth, decreased
colony formation, and enhanced cisplatin sensitivity while overexpression of CXCR4
rendered cells more resistant to cisplatin. Moreover, the percentage of apoptosis
and cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase of cisplatin-treated CXCR4 knockdown cells
was significantly higher than control cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated CXCR4
knockdown cells showed lower levels of mutant p53 and Bcl-2 protein than the control
group, while also having higher levels of caspase-3 and Bax. However overexpression
of CXCR4 had the reverse effect. In vivo experiments confirmed that downregulation
of CXCR4 enhanced cisplatin anticancer activity in tumor-bearing mice, and that this
enhanced anticancer activity is attributable to tumor cell apoptosis. Thus, this study
indicates that CXCR4 can modulate cisplatin sensitivity in TNBC cells and suggests
that CXCR4 may be a therapeutic target for TNBC.

plays an important role in TNBC treatment, especially for
patients with advanced TNBC disease [3, 4].
Patients usually have a good initial response to
cisplatin-based chemotherapy. However, drug resistance
is a fundamental problem in TNBC management, and is
responsible for most cases of treatment failure in patients
with metastatic cancer [5, 6]. Ciplatin’s cytotoxicity to
normal tissues and cancer cells’s acquired resistance
reduces the clinical efficacy of this drug [7]. The exact
mechanism of cisplatin resistance is not clear. Previous
studies have shown that the development of drug
resistance is related to the tumor microenvironment, in

INTRODUCTION
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an invasive
carcinoma, of the breast, that lacks expression of the
estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). TNBC
accounts for about 12–17% of all breast cancers and is
aggressive: there is no targeted therapy available. Patients
with TNBC have an increased likelihood of distant
recurrence (brain, lung and liver) and of death compared
to women with other types of breast cancer [1, 2]. In
addition to surgery, systematic chemotherapy like cisplatin

which chemokines appear to play pivotal roles in tumor
progression, metastasis and tumor cell dormancy [8, 9].
To date, 46 different human chemokines are
described as ligands for at least 18 G protein–coupled
receptors [10]. In the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia
(AML), interrupting the connection between leukemic
cells and the tumor microenvironment by targeting the
stromal-derived factor-1α/CXCR4 (SDF-1α/CXCR4) axis
has become an attractive approach [11, 12]. Previously, we
and others demonstrated that CXCR4 surface expression
is an independent prognostic factor for disease relapse
and survival in breast cancer [13]. CXCR4 is of particular
importance in other solid cancers, including gastric
cancer and colorectal cancer [14]. In addition, CXCR4 is
now known to be critical in almost all aspects of cancer
biology, including proliferation, apoptosis, invasion,
metastasis and angiogenesis. In recent years, studies
revealed that CXCR4 signaling mediates chemoresistance
in hematologic malignancies [15].
Based on this information, we investigated
the involvement of CXCR4 in TNBC sensitivity to
cisplatin. To confirm whether CXCR4 affects the
efficacy of treatment with cisplatin, we selected a stable
CXCR4 knockdown TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231
and overexpression CXCR4 in MDA-MB-468 cells.
In vivo and in vitro analyses demonstrated that CXCR4
knockdown cells enhanced the sensitivity to cisplatin, and
that suppressing CXCR4 signaling may render TNBC
cells responsiveness to cisplatin treatment. In contrast,
overexpression of CXCR4 stimulated TNBC cell growth
and enhanced resistance to cisplatin compared with that
of control cells. We further examined whether CXCR4
knockdown increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis. The
mechanism by which CXCR4 silencing induced apoptosis
was also explored. In the present study, we aimed to reveal
the potential role of CXCR4 in response to cisplatin and
provide a new clue for future clinical treatments of TNBC
patients who are resistant to cisplatin treatment.

same cells transfected with empty vector (Figure 1A).
Increased growth inhibition compared with MDA-MB231-NC cells was observed at cisplatin concentrations of
10 and 20 μM. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) (Figure 1B) at 48 h was 16.07 ± 1.77 μM and 32.43
± 1.21 μM for MDA-MB-231-shCXCR4 and MDA-MB231-NC cells, respectively (p = 0.000), indicating that
CXCR4 knockdown increases sensitivity to cisplatin.
Consistent with this, we found that it was more resistant
to cisplatin in CXCR4 overexpression MDA-MB-468CXCR4 cells than MDA-MB-468-NC cells. The IC50
at 48 h was 39.92 ± 1.8 μM and 13.73 ± 0.75 μM for
MDA-MB-468-CXCR4 and MDA-MB-468-NC cells,
respectively (p = 0.000, Figure 1B). In a colony formation
assay, knockdown of CXCR4 inhibited MDA-MB-231
colony formation, whereas overexpression of CXCR4
stimulated MDA-MB-468 colony formation compared
to the control (Figure 1C–1E). In addition, cisplatin
effectively inhibited colony formation of these cells in a
dose-dependent manner (p = 0.000). These results suggest
that CXCR4 might be involved in the regulation of cell
proliferation.

CXCR4 knockdown increases cisplatin-induced
apoptosis and G2/M phase arrest
To further assess the effect of CXCR4 on the
sensitivity of TNBC cells to chemotherapy, we examined
the cell cycle using flow cytometry (Figure 2A and 2B).
The percentage of cells in each cell phase is shown in
Figure 2C and 2D. Cisplatin (1 μM) treatment for 48 h
increased the number of MDA-MB-231-shCXCR4 cells
in G2/M phase compared with the untreated group (p =
0.001). To quantify apoptosis, we analyzed the percentage
of sub-G1 cell cycles. The percentage of apoptosis of
MDA-MB-231-shCXCR4 cells was 8.42 ± 0.76%,
following treatment with 1 μM cisplatin. However, the
same cisplatin concentration induced apoptosis in only
1.06 ± 0.18% of MDA-MB-231-NC cells (p = 0.002;
Figure 2E). The percentage of cisplatin-induced apoptosis
of CXCR4-negative MDA-MB-468 cells was higher
than that of the control groups (4.30 ± 0.89% and 1.04 ±
0.22%, respectively, p = 0.025). However, there was no
significantly observation of the G2/M arrest in MDA-MB468-CXCR4 cells after cisplatin treatment compared with
the untreated group (p = 0.162).

RESULTS
CXCR4 knockdown enhances cisplatin-induced
growth and colony formation inhibition in TNBC
cells
Our previous studies indicated that CXCR4
silencing affects the proliferation of breast cancer cells
compared with parental cells [13]. To assess the effects of
CXCR4 on chemosensitivity, cell viability was assessed 48
h after exposure to various concentrations of cisplatin. We
established stable cell lines that MDA-MB-231 shRNAmediated knockdown of CXCR4 and transient transfection
overexpression CXCR4 in MDA-MB-468 cells.

We further analyzed whether a similar phenomenon
could be observed in vivo using an immunodeficient
nude mouse model (Figure 3A). We found that tumors
derived from MDA-MB-231-shCXCR4 cells showed
slower growth and smaller tumor volume and weight

CXCR4 knockdown enhances cisplatin-induced
apoptosis through the Bax/Bcl-2/caspase-3
pathway
To further understand the molecular events involved
in the apoptosis resulting from CXCR4 knockdown, we
next investigated the expression of p53, Bcl-2, Bax, and
caspase-3, which are pivotal for cell apoptosis. Figure 4A
shows the expression of these proteins in MDA-MB-231
cells. Expression of mutant p53 was clearly downregulated
in MDA-MB-231 cells after transfection of CXCR4
shRNA and/or treatment with cisplatin. Simultaneously,
we observed upregulation of Bax and cleaved caspase-3
and downregulation of Bcl-2, suggesting that a decrease
in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio might be involved in the apoptosis
induced by CXCR4 shRNA combined with cisplatin in
MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, the expression of
mutant p53 and Bcl-2 were increased and decreased Bax
was decreased in CXCR4 transfected MDA-MB-468 cells
(Figure 4B). But no observation of cleaved caspase-3 in
MDA-MB-468-CXCR4 cells after treatment with cisplatin.

4.50% in the saline-treated group. The AI percentage for
the MDA-MB-231 cells treated with cisplatin and saline
was 5.58 ± 5.30% and 0.3 ± 0.1%, respectively. Therefore
the AI was significantly higher in the CXCR4 sh-RNA and

We then used immunohistochemistry and detected
p53, caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax expression in tumor tissues
obtained from the orthotopic mouse model. We similarly
found results in this model, with significantly decreased p53
and Bcl-2 proteins and increased caspase-3 and Bax proteins
(Figure 4C a–p). These findings demonstrated that CXCR4
down-regulation increased the apoptosis via leading to the
imbalance in the expression of apoptosis related proteins.

improvements in the treatment of advanced TNBC,
cisplatin resistance is a fundamental problem in TNBC
management, responsible for most cases of treatment
failure in patients with metastatic TNBC [17–20]. An
emerging understanding of the molecular pathways that
characterize cell growth, cell cycle, apoptosis, angiogenesis
and invasion have provided novel targets for TNBC therapy
[21, 22]. Combining cisplatin with non-cytotoxic agents is
imperative to improving the efficacy of chemotherapeutics
and overcoming cisplatin-resistance [23]. Previous studies
reported that treating leukemia with a combination of
CXCR4 inhibitors and chemotherapeutic agents produced
additive therapeutic effects [24, 25]. However, the exact
mechanism underlying cisplatin-resistance is still unclear.
CXCR4 is a seven transmembrane, G proteincoupled receptor widely expressed in various cell

types, including lymphocytes, hematopoietic stem cells,
endothelial and epithelial cells, and cancer cells [26].
Several studies have demonstrated the involvement of
CXCR4 in cell proliferation, migration, and metastasis
of solid tumors in a variety of cancers, such as gastric
cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer [27–29].
CXCR4-positive cell is an independent prognostic
factor for poor patient survival: CXCR4 expression is
associated with tumorigenesis and progression [30, 31].
Our previous studies indicated that CXCR4 was expressed
more frequently in the TNBC than in other subtypes breast
cancer. In the TNBC group, CXCR4 positive patients have
a significantly higher rate of visceral metastasis (liver,
lung and brain). The expression level of CXCR4 also
significantly correlates with tumor size, advanced TNM
stage, and shorter overall and disease-free survival [13].
It was reported that patients with higher CXCR4
expression have significantly lower chemosensitivity and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

poorer progression-free and overall survival. Knocking
down CXCR4 via small interfering RNA (siRNA)
suppresses cell proliferation, and increases apoptosis and
chemosensitivity to cisplatin in epithelial ovarian cancer
[32]. Mao et al. reported that CXCL12-combining
CXCR4 receptors could inhibit caspase-3 activation by
increasing the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax after traumatic brain
injury: this inhibition protected neurons from apoptosis
[33]. Another study demonstrated that ADM3100,
a CXCR4 antagonist, could inhibit cell migration,
decrease the secretion of angiogenic cytokines, and
downregulate the Bcl-2/Bax ratio to modulate apoptosis
progression in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells
(MSC) [34].
In the current work, we show that downregulation
of CXCR4 results in increased cisplatin-induced growth
inhibition. Consistent with this, we found that it was
more resistant to cisplatin in CXCR4 overexpression

MDA-MB-468-CXCR4 cells than MDA-MB-468-NC
cells. Interestingly, we find that knockdown of CXCR4
not only has an inhibitory effect on TNBC, but can also
dramatically enhance the chemosensitivity to cisplatin.
Analysis of the percent of cells in the sub-G1 cell cycle
phase, to quantify apoptosis, revealed that the percentage
of cells in apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest for MDAMB-231-shCXCR4 cells treated with cisplatin was
significantly higher than for control cells.
To explore the mechanisms underlying this
phenomenon, we examined the expression levels of p53,
Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3. In this study, the expression
of mutant p53 was downregulated in MDA-MB-231shCXCR4 cells at the protein level after cisplatin
treatment. Simultaneously, we observed upregulation of
Bax and downregulation of Bcl-2 while overexpression
of CXCR4 had the reverse effect. These findings suggest
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that decreased Bcl-2/Bax ratios might be involved in the
apoptosis induced by CXCR4 knockdown combined
with cisplatin. Wild-type p53 is known for its ability to
induce apoptosis, the most important anti-tumor barrier
[35]. However, p53 is the most frequently mutated gene
in human cancers (more than 50%), and mutant p53 loses
its ability to inhibit cell growth [36], and can inhibit cell
apoptosis and induce carcinogenesis after exposure to
DNA-damaging agents [37]. Our results show that mutant
p53 expression is downregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells
(harboring mutant p53). Moreover, the balance between
the expression levels of pro-survival and pro-apoptotic
Bcl-2 family members (e.g. Bcl-2 and Bax) is critical
for cell survival or death [38, 39]. Our results show that
combining CXCR4 knockdown and cisplatin treatment
leads to upregulation of Bax, a pro-apoptotic protein and
concomitant downregulation of Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic
1025

protein, thereby decreasing the Bcl-2/Bax ratio compared
with that in cells exposed to cisplatin alone. Most drug
compounds reportedly induce apoptosis through intrinsic
death signaling pathways. Caspase-3 is regarded as a
member of the apoptosis executioner caspases and cleaves
many key proteins in apoptosis [40]. We found that CXCR4
knockdown can increase the activation of caspase-3 and
induce apoptosis. This indicates that CXCR4 knockdown
may act through the Bax/Bcl-2/caspase-3 signaling
pathway to induce apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells.
Studies have shown an association between cell
cycle regulation and cancer, and inhibition of the cell cycle
has become an appreciated target for cancer management
[41]. In our study, CXCR4 knockdown augmented
cisplatin-mediated G2/M phase arrest in MDA-MB-231
cells. The tumor suppressor p53 acts as a cell cycle
checkpoint regulator, contributing to cell cycle arrest in
the G1 and G2 phases via multiple pathways [42–44].
Activated p53 interacts with response elements present
on the promoter region of p21 to increase expression of
p21, which subsequently interacts with CDKs to affect cell
cycle arrest [45, 46]. Since MDA-MB-231 cells express
mutant p53 [47, 48], the downregulation of p53 that we
observed by RNA interference-mediated knockdown of
CXCR4 may increase cisplatin anti-tumor activity by
inducing cell arrest in the G2/M phase.
In vivo experiments revealed that tumors in the
cisplatin treatment group derived from MDA-MB-231shCXCR4 cells show slower growth and smaller tumor
volume. Data from the TUNEL staining assay show that
the apoptosis index (AI) is dramatically increased in the
CXCR4 shRNA combined with cisplatin group compared
with the other three groups. Furthermore, we find the
expression of mutant p53 and Bcl-2 decreases, and Bax
proteins increase simultaneously.
In conclusion, our novel findings show that
downregulation of CXCR4 can enhance cisplatin-induced
growth inhibition and apoptosis in TNBC, suggesting
that CXCR4 may be an emerging new strategy for TNBC
therapy. These effects could be due to CXCR4 knockdowninduced G2/M arrest and apoptosis through upregulation of
Bax and caspase-3 and downregulation of Bcl-2. Further
studies should evaluate whether CXCR4-targeted therapy
in combination with cytotoxic agents enhances the antitumor effects of chemotherapy in human clinical trials.

(100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml)—termed
complete medium—and maintained in monolayer culture
at 37°C in humidified air with 5% CO2. We used a CXCR4
knockdown cell line, denoted MDA-MB-231-shCXCR4,
previously described [13]. The cells were cultured at 37°C
under a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.

Transient transfections
Subconfluent proliferating MDA-MB-468 cells (a
TNBC cell line, CXCR4 negative) were transfected with
increasing amounts of pGCMV/IRES/EGFP CXCR4
expressing plasmid and control vector using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Twenty four hours after transfection, the cells line
expressing CXCR4 (MDA-MB-468-CXCR4) or empty
vector (MDA-MB-468-NC) was harvested for in vitro assay.

Cell proliferation assay
The effect of cisplatin (Hansoh Pharmaceutical,
Jiangsu, China) on the growth ability of TNBC cells was
determined via MTT assay. Cells (5×103 /well) were
seeded in 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h in complete
medium before the addition of increasing concentrations
(0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 μM) of cisplatin for 48 h. Then
20 μl MTT (5 mg/ml) was added to every well and incubated
for 4 h. After removal of the medium, the dye crystals were
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and absorbance
was measured at 492 nm with a Multiskan MK3 reader
(Thermo Scientific). Inhibition was calculated as follows: IR
(%) = [(absorbance of the control group – absorbance of the
test group)/absorbance of the control group] × 100%. Three
independent experiments were done in triplicate wells.

Colony formation assay

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cells were seeded at a density of 1×105 in a 24-well
plate and allowed to adhere overnight. The cells were then
treated with 0, 0.1 and 1 μM cisplatin. Forty-eight hours
after cisplatin addition, cells were trypsinized, counted, and
reseeded at a low density (200 cells/well in a 6-well culture
dish) in triplicate. Medium was replaced every 3 days, and
the cells were allowed to grow for 14 days. The number
of colonies containing more than 50 cells in each dish was
counted under a microscope. The cloning efficiency (CE)
was calculated as follows: CE (%) = (number of colonies
formed) / (number of cells added) × 100%.

Cells were inoculated in 60 mm plates and incubated
for 24 h to resume exponential growth. Cisplatin (0, 1

The pellets were resuspended in 0.1 mg/ml of propidium
iodide (PI) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and RNase A
(1 mg/ml, both from Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The
cell suspension was incubated in the dark for 30 minutes
at room temperature. Cell cycle and apoptosis were
quantified by measuring the DNA content of cells by flow
cytometry (BD, FACSCalibur, USA). The proportion of
sub-G1 phase (apoptotic) cells (%) and the proportions
cells in other phases (%) reflected cell cycle. The
experiment was repeated three times. The percentage of
cells in different phases of the cell cycle was determined
using a ModFit 3.1 computer program.

95% viability were used. Cells (5 × 106) were inoculated
into bilateral breast fat pads (orthotopic tumor model),
with the left side being inoculated with MDA-MB-231NC cells and the right side with MDA-MB-231-shCXCR4
cells. When tumors reached a size of approximately
100 mm3, animals were then randomly allocated for
cisplatin treatment or 0.9% saline. Then mice were
intraperitoneally injected with 2 mg/kg cisplatin for one
week, while the control group received an equal volume
of 0.9% saline and the treatment was administered every
third day. The tumor sizes were measured every three
days using a digital caliper. The tumor volume were
determined with the formula: tumor volume [mm]3 =
(length [mm]) (width [mm])2 ×0.52. The average tumor
volume of each group was calculated and tumor growth
curves were drawn accordingly. The rates of anti-tumor
activity were then calculated. After 3 weeks, all surviving
mice were euthanized by an overdose of CO2 exposure
and were evaluated macroscopically for the presence of
orthotopic tumors. After treatment, the tumor xenografts
were excised and weighed. Tumor tissues were fixed in
10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, cut into
4-μm-thick sections, and then used for the TUNEL and
immunohistochemical assays.

Western blot assay
Both cell lines, at a density of 1×105 /ml, were
exposed to 10 μM cisplatin for 48 h. Cells not treated
with cisplatin were used as controls. Cells were collected
with a cell scraper and placed in lysis buffer for 30 min at
4°C, then centrifuged at 12,000 g at 4°C for 15 min. The
supernatant was then collected. Total protein was quantified
using a BCA kit (Beyotime, China), and 30 μg of protein
was separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto
a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica,
MA). Membranes were blocked using 5% non-fat milk in
TBST for 2 h at room temperature. After briefly washing
with 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) in TBS,
the membrane was incubated with anti-CXCR4 (ab2074,
Abcam Corp. Cambridge, United Kingdom), anti-p53
(BM0101, Boster, Wuhan, China), anti-caspase-3 (#9665,
Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), anti-Bax (#5023,
Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), anti-Bcl-2
(#4223, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) and antiβ-actin (TA-09, Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology,
Beijing, China) antibodies at 4°C overnight. Blots were
then incubated in secondary antibody conjugated with HRP
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) for 2 h at room temperature.
The protein bands were visualized with ECL plus Western
blotting detection reagents (Thermo Scientific, USA).

Immunohistochemistry
Orthotopic tumor paraffin sections were dewaxed
and rehydrated, and antigen retrieval was performed by
microwaving in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0,
for 15 minutes. Sections were then incubated with 3%
hydrogen peroxide for 20 min at room temperature to block
endogenous peroxidase, then blocked in 10% normal goat
serum for 1 h. Immunostaining was performed by incubating
with anti-PCNA (bs-2006R, Bioss, Beijing, China)
antibody, anti-p53 antibody, anti-caspase-3 (ZM-0320,
Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology, Beijing, China )
antibody, anti-Bax antibody or anti-Bcl-2 antibody at 4°C
overnight. Slides were then washed in PBS and incubated
with biotinylated secondary antibody (GTVision I, AntiMouse/Rabbit Detection System, Gene Tech Company) for
30 min at 37°C. Staining was visualized with 3, 3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and counterstained with hematoxylin.

Animals
All animals were cared for in accordance with the
Animal Welfare Act guidelines under an animal protocol
approved by Shantou University Medical College Animal
Care and Use Committee. Six-week-old female BALB/c nude
mice (Vital River Laboratories, Beijing, China) were used to
establish the experimental orthotopic nude mouse model.

Apoptotic index (AI)
Detection of apoptotic cells was performed on the
basis of the TUNEL method with an ApopTag Peroxidase
in situ cell apoptosis detection kit (Boster, Wuhan, China)
according to the manufacturer’s directions. Tumor sections
were examined by microscopy. At least 100 tumor cells
per field were counted in five randomly selected fields
at a 40× magnification. Cells in which the nucleus or
cytoplasm was dyed yellow and brown were identified to
be undergoing apoptosis. The percentage of apoptotic cells
was calculated as the number of apoptotic cells divided

Orthotopic nude mice breast tumor model
For the experimental orthotopic model, subconfluent MDA-MB-231-NC or MDA-MB-231shCXCR4 cells were harvested by trypsinization and
resuspended in DMEM. Only single-cell suspensions with

who were blinded to the treatment group counted cells
independently. The apoptotic index was determined from
the average of counts from five randomly selected fields.

Statistical analysis
Each assay was performed in triplicate and
repeated a minimum of three times. Statistical analysis
was performed using SPSS 17.0 for Windows. Data are
reported as means ± SD. Statistical differences were
analyzed by Student’s t-test for paired data between
control and treated groups, or a one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) for data from multiple groups, with
the level of significance set at p < 0.05.
