Abstract
Insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) overexpression
may play a role in prostate cancer progression. We found
previously that, in prostate cancer cells, IGF-IR is up-regulated
by both androgens and estrogens via a nongenotropic pathway.
We now show that, in prostate cancer cells, stimulation with
either androgens or estrogens up-regulates IGF-IR by inducing
cyclic AMP response element–binding protein (CREB) activation. Both sex steroids phosphorylated CREB at Ser133 in a
dose-dependent manner in androgen receptor (AR)–positive
LNCaP cells, whereas only estrogens phosphorylated CREB in
AR-negative PC3 cells. CREB phosphorylation involved c-Src–
dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation,
but not protein kinase A, protein kinase C, or calmodulindependent kinase II, and occurred also in cells transfected with
AR or estrogen receptor mutants that do not localize into the
nucleus. CREB silencing abrogated IGF-IR up-regulation and
promoter activation. We also showed that CREB binds to IGFIR promoter region and identified the relevant CREB-binding
site at the 5¶-untranslated region fragment of IGF-IR promoter.
In conclusion, we describe a novel mechanism of IGF-IR upregulation and promoter activity by CREB activation, induced
by sex steroids, through a nongenotropic signaling. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Prostate cancer is usually initially responsive to androgenic regulation but eventually progresses to a stage that is highly resistant
to androgen deprivation and poorly responsive to all available
therapies (1). Many factors account for progression to androgen
independence, including the possibility that the androgen receptor
(AR) signaling pathway is activated in an androgen-independent
manner. A possible role of estrogens is suggested by findings
showing that most primary and metastatic prostate cancers express
a subtype of the estrogen receptor (ER)-h (2–4) and that ER blockade
may inhibit growth and/or induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells
(2, 5).
Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF)-I and II and their cognate
receptor, the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR), play a key role in regulating

growth, survival, and invasion in a variety of human malignancies,
including prostate cancer (6, 7). In human prostate cancer
xenografts, progression to androgen independence is associated
with increased expression of both IGF-IR and IGF-I (8, 9) and
increased responsiveness to IGF-I (10). In transgenic mice
expressing human IGF-I in the prostate epithelium, IGF-IR is
activated and prostate cells undergo tumorigenesis (11). IGF-IR
down-regulation suppresses prostate cancer growth in rats and
invasiveness of human cancer transplants in mice (12, 13).
We have shown previously that both androgens and estrogens
markedly up-regulate IGF-IR in prostate cancer cells. This effect
requires binding of sex steroids to ER or AR but not receptor binding
to specific DNA response elements (14, 15). IGF-IR up-regulation is
actually dependent by the c-Src/extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) pathway and can be more effectively blocked by Src and
ERK1/2 inhibitors rather than by antiandrogens and antiestrogens
(14, 15), showing that it is mediated by nongenotropic signaling, that
is, by kinase-initiated effects that do not involve steroid receptor
binding to canonical steroid response elements on DNA.
An increasing number of important biological effects of sex
steroids involving nongenotropic signaling, including apoptosis
protection (16), cyclin D1 up-regulation (17), and bone-protective
effects (18, 19), have been recently shown.
Previous studies have indicated that transcription regulation of
certain gene by estrogens may involve the cyclic AMP response
element (CRE; refs. 20, 21). CRE, located in the regulatory regions of
target genes, is bound by CRE-binding protein (CREB), a member
of the CREB/CREM/ATF family of transcription factors. Estrogens
may induce CREB phosphorylation at Ser133 residue (22, 23), which
is required for CREB-binding protein recruitment and CREBmediated transactivation of transcription. Limited data are
available concerning CREB activation by androgens (16, 24).
In the present study, we found that CREB activation is a
common mechanism involved in IGF-IR promoter activation by
androgens and estrogens.

human ER-a and ER-h were provided by Prof. P. Chambon. The dominantnegative CREB (DN CREB) construct was provided by Dr. C. Vinson. Rat
IGF-IR promoter sequences cloned into pGL3 vector were provided by Dr.
C.T. Roberts, Jr. The cDNAs encoding mutants of the ligand-binding domain
(E) of the human ER-a, E-CFP ( fused to nontargeted fluorescent protein),
E-Mem-CFP (with a membrane localization sequence), and E-Nuc-CFP
(with a nuclear localization sequence), as well as the serum response
element ligated to the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter gene,
were provided by Drs. S. Kousteni and S. Manolagas. The CRE reporter was
from SABiosciences. The MMTV-luc reporter gene was provided by Dr. A.
Farsetti.
CREB activation. For CREB activation, serum-starved cells were
stimulated with 10 nmol/L sex steroids for 30 min and lysed in Laemmli
buffer. Cell lysates were run on 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western
blot with a phosphospecific monoclonal antibody recognizing phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) at Ser133.
Transient transfection and reporter assays. HEK293 cells were
transiently transfected as described previously (14). Twenty-four hours
after transfection, cells were serum starved for 36 h and incubated with sex
steroids, 10 nmol/L, or vehicle. For luciferase assay, cells were stimulated for
18 h, lysed, and processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency
using a vector coding for the H2B-green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter
gene (pBOS H2B-GFP-N1). For serum response element-SEAP activity,
supernatants were collected and SEAP activity was measured using the
Great EscAPe SEAP Chemiluminescence Kit (Clontech Laboratories).
Generation of mutated IGF-IR promoter by site-directed mutagenesis. The method used to obtain the pGL3 reporters of IGF-IR promoter
containing a mutated a 5¶-untranslated region (5¶-UTR) fragment in the
CREB motif ( 44 to 36; Stratagene) is based on a PCR done on the
plasmid template by using two complementary primers containing
the mutation. The PCR was done by using the Pfu DNA polymerase, the
pGL3 recombinant IGF-IR 5¶-UTR as template, and the following pairs of

complementary primers (mutation is shown in lowercase letters): 5¶CTCTTACGCGTGCTAGCgtagGTGCGCGGCCCCGAGAG-3¶ (sense) and 5¶CTCTCGGGGCCGCGCACctacGCTAGCACGCGTAAGAG-3¶ (antisense). PCR
conditions were set according to the manufacturer’s suggestions. The PCR
product was incubated with the restriction enzyme DpnI to digest the
parental methylated DNA. The pGL3 recombinant IGF-IR 5¶-UTR deleted
in the CREB motif ( 44 to 36) was produced as described above by using
the following pairs of complementary primers: 5¶-ACGCGTGCTAGCTGTGCGCGGCCC-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-GGGCCGCGCACAGCTAGCACGCGT-3¶ (antisense).
Gene silencing by short hairpin RNA. For short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
experiments, LNCaP cells were transiently transfected with a mixture
containing 6 Ag of either four different shRNAs against CREB or scramble
shRNAs and Lipofectamine LTX according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen).
Bioinformatic analysis. Human and rat IGF-IR promoter sequences
were obtained from National Center for Biotechnology Information
database. The sequences were aligned using Blast2seq tool. Identification
of putative CREB-binding sites was obtained using both the Genomatix
software package (Genomatix Software) and the Transcription Element
Search Software using the recommended default settings.
Preparation of nuclear extracts and DNA affinity precipitation
assay. Serum-starved LNCaP cells were stimulated or not with 10 nmol/L sex
steroids for 18 h and nuclear extracts were obtained as described previously
(25) and stored at 80jC until used. The DNA-binding assay was done by
mixing 200 Ag nuclear protein extract, 2 Ag biotinylated DNA sequences
( fragment 53/ 24 of the rat IGF-IR promoter), and 30 AL streptavidin-agarose
beads. The mixture was incubated for 3 h at 4jC. DNA-bound proteins were
eluted and analyzed by Western blot. To obtain rat IGF-IR promoter-specific
sequences, we used the following biotinylated oligonucleotides: for the wild-type
fragment 5¶-biotin-GTGTGCGCGCGGGCACGTGTGCGCGGCCCC-3¶, for the
mutated fragment 5¶-biotin-GTGTGCGCGCGGGCgtagGTGCGCGGCCCC-3¶
(mutation in lowercase), and for the deleted fragment 5¶-biotinGTGTGCGCGCGGGCTGTGCGCGGCCCC-3¶. The oligonucleotides were

annealed with the corresponding complementary strand immediately before
immunoprecipitation.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and PCR. LNCaP cells were
serum starved for 24 h and incubated in the presence or absence of 10
nmol/L sex steroids for 18 h. Cells were then processed according to
ChampionChIP One-Day Kit (SaBiosciences). Briefly, cells were cross-linked
for 10 min with 1% formaldehyde and lysed. Lysate pellets were
resuspended and sonicated with a Microson sonifier XL-2000 (Misonix).
Protein-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated using either monoclonal
anti-pCREB (Ser133) antibody or control IgG bound to protein A/G agarose,
eluted, and digested with proteinase K. PCR was done using primers 5¶CTCGAGAGAGGCGGGAGAGC-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-GGAGCGGGGCCGAGGGTCTG-3¶ (reverse) specific for human IGF-IR promoter fragment
+119/+201 (size 82 bp). PCR amplification was carried out for 40 cycles of
30 s at 95jC, 30 s at 62jC, and 30 s at 72jC. PCR was also done using
primers 5¶-ACACACTTGGAAGTCCCGGG-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-TTGGGAGGGAGGAGGATTG-3¶ (reverse) for Sox-9 promoter fragment (size 150 bp).
PCR amplification was carried out for 36 cycles of 30 s at 95jC, 30 s at
54jC, and 30 s at 72jC. PCR products were analyzed on agarose gel
electrophoresis and stained with Syber Safe (Invitrogen).

Results
Both androgens and estrogens activate CREB phosphorylation in prostate cancer cells. We first used the AR-positive LNCaP
cells that also express the ER-h. To evaluate CREB phosphorylation,
cells were incubated with 10 nmol/L of either 17h-estradiol (E2) or
the nonaromatizable androgen R1881. As shown in Fig. 1A (top),
both E2 and R1881 induced time-dependent CREB phosphorylation. CREB phosphorylation started to increase 10 min after
stimulation reaching maximum after 1 h with both steroids. It
declined after 1 h and increased again after 18 h incubation. Total
CREB expression remained unaltered. No CREB phosphorylation
was observed in control cells incubated with vehicle alone.
We then evaluated CREB phosphorylation in AR-negative prostate
cancer cells (PC3) that express both ER-a and ER-h subtypes. E2 but
not R1881 induced time-dependent CREB phosphorylation, which
reached maximum at 30 to 60 min, declined at 2 h, and then
increased again at 18 h (Fig. 1A, bottom). In LNCaP cells, CREB
phosphorylation was activated by low doses of steroids, starting
from 0.1 nmol/L and reached maximum at 100 nmol/L (Fig. 1B, top).
In PC3 cells exposed to E2, CREB phosphorylation followed the same
pattern (Fig. 1B, bottom).
We also incubated LNCaP and PC3 cells with estren (a synthetic
ER ligand that elicits only nongenotropic signals) and with
dihydrotestosterone (both at 10 nmol/L for 30 min). CREB
phosphorylation was induced by all ligands in LNCaP cells,
whereas it was only induced by E2 and estren in PC3 cells (Fig. 1C).
CREB activation in transfected cells. To evaluate whether
ectopic AR expression in PC3 cells induces androgen-dependent
CREB phosphorylation, we used AR-transfected PC3 cells (PC3/
AR). In these cells, CREB phosphorylation could be induced by E2
and R1881 incubation (Fig. 2A).
We next evaluated whether each ER subtype was able to activate
estrogen-mediated CREB phosphorylation in the absence of AR
and, conversely, whether the AR was also able to induce CREB
activation in the absence of ER. As LNCaP cells express a mutated
AR, ART877A, we also compared the effect of AR wild-type (ARwt)
and ART877A in HEK293 cells. Cells were stably transfected with
ER-a or ER-h or ARwt or ART877A and incubated with either E2 or
R1881 (10 nmol/L for 30 min). Control cells were transfected with
the corresponding empty vectors. As shown in Fig. 2B and C, CREB
phosphorylation was higher in both ER- and AR-transfected cells

compared with controls. CREB phosphorylation could be stimulated by E2 in ER-transfected cells (Fig. 2B) but could be stimulated
by R1881 in AR-transfected cells (Fig. 2C).
CREB activation by sex steroids is mediated by nongenotropic signaling. We first evaluated whether sex steroid–induced
CREB phosphorylation was a genomic effect. We transfected
HEK293 cells with an ER mutant targeted to the plasma membrane
(E-Mem-CFP), which is unable to bind to DNA but retains the
ability to activate the ERK pathway or with AR mutants that are
either unable to bind DNA (AR-C619Y) or to translocate into the
nucleus (AR-C574R). Control cells were transfected with an empty
vector, with a nontargeted ER (E-CFP), with a nucleus-targeted ER
(E-Nuc-CFP), or with ARwt. To confirm the specific localization of
the ER mutants, we used a serum response element-SEAP reporter,
which is induced by ER located in the cytoplasm but repressed by
ER present in the nucleus. E2 stimulated SEAP activity in the
presence of the membrane-targeted or nontargeted ERs but not in
the presence of nucleus-targeted ER (Fig. 3A). R1881 was used as
negative control. Parallel experiments with a MMTV-luc reporter
were carried out to confirm the lack of transcriptional activity of
the mutated ARs (Fig. 3B). Indeed, MMTV activity was only
stimulated in the presence of the ARwt.

CREB Activation by Sex Steroids Up-regulates IGF-IR

CREB phosphorylation was induced by both E2 and estren in
cells transfected with membrane-targeted or nontargeted ER but
not with nucleus-targeted ER (E-Nuc-CFP; Fig. 3C). Androgens
stimulated CREB phosphorylation also in cells transfected with AR
mutants unable to bind DNA as well as in ARwt-transfected cells
(Fig. 3D).
We next showed that both phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and
ERK pathways, but not protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and
calmodulin-dependent kinase II, are involved in CREB phosphorylation and activation by sex steroids (see Supplementary Figs. S1
and S2).
CREB activity is required for IGF-IR promoter activation
and protein up-regulation by sex steroids. We then evaluated
whether sex steroid–induced CREB phosphorylation plays a role in
IGF-IR promoter activation. We transiently transfected HEK293
cells with either ER-a or ER-h or the ART877A together with a
luciferase construct containing the full-length IGF-IR promoter.
Cotransfection of DN CREB completely blocked IGF-IR promoter
stimulation by sex steroids (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained
with CREB silencing with shRNAs (data not shown). Finally, DN
CREB was able to inhibit CRE activity stimulation by sex steroids in
the presence of their cognate receptors (Fig. 4B). CREB silencing by
shRNAs also completely blocked CREB phosphorylation and
ligand-induced IGF-IR protein up-regulation both in LNCaPtransfected and in ER- or ART877A-transfected HEK293 cells
(Fig. 4C and D). We further showed that sex steroid–dependent
IGF-IR promoter activity in HEK293 cells was dependent on the
PI3K/Akt and c-Src/ERK pathway by using dominant-negatives and

constitutively active forms of Src, MEK1, and p85/p110. In contrast,
dominant-negative constructs for the protein kinase A, protein
kinase Ca, and a-calmodulin-dependent kinase II were ineffective
(see Supplementary Fig. S3).
Identification of sequences binding CREB on the IGF-IR
promoter. By bioinformatic analysis, we found three different
CREB sites in the 5¶-UTR promoter, which shows 85% homology
between rat and human gene. To confirm the involvement of these
sites, we first analyzed the activity of the rat 5¶-UTR compared with
the 5¶-flanking region and the full-length promoter in ER- or
ART877A-transfected cells (Fig. 5A). The basal activity of the 5¶UTR fragment was f80% the activity of the full-length promoter,
whereas the activity of the 5¶-flanking fragment dropped to f60%.
After stimulation with sex steroids the activity of the 5¶-UTR
fragment increased significantly compared with basal (P = 0.04 for
ER-a, P = 0.03 for ER-h, and P = 0.01 for ART877A), whereas the 5¶flanking fragment was unresponsive (Fig. 5A).
To confirm the crucial role of a CREB-binding site present in the
5¶-UTR fragment, we obtained two 5¶-UTR mutated fragments: in
the first one, we introduced a nucleotide substitution in the CRE
site (GCACGT versus GCGTAG), whereas, in the second one, we
performed a deletion (GCACGT versus GCxxxT) in the same site.
We then compared the activity of these two promoter fragments
with that of the wild-type 5¶-UTR fragment (Fig. 5B). The basal
activity of both mutated and deleted 5¶-UTR fragments was
reduced to approximately half that of the 5¶-UTR fragment wildtype. In addition, the promoter activity in response to sex steroids
was significantly lower in the mutated 5¶-UTR fragment than with

by immunoblotting. D, stable HEK293 cell clones transfected with a plasmid encoding either ARwt, ARC619Y, ARC574R, or the corresponding empty vector were
exposed to 10 nmol/L E2, R1881, or dihydrotestosterone for 30 min. CREB phosphorylation and transfected AR were evaluated by immunoblotting. Representative

and P = 0.01 for ART877A) and was completely lost in the deleted
5¶-UTR promoter fragment (Fig. 5B).
We then evaluated rat IGF-IR promoter occupancy by the
steroid-activated CREB using DNA affinity precipitation assay
(Fig. 6A). We used biotinylated oligonucleotides containing either
the 5¶-UTR CRE site (GCACGT) or a mutated (GCAtag) or a deleted
(GCxxxT) sequence. Nuclear extracts of LNCaP cells unstimulated
or exposed to sex steroids for 18 h were incubated with each of the
three oligonucleotides and DNA-binding proteins were analyzed by
Western blot. Recruitment of pCREB to the wild-type DNA probe
was found in unstimulated cells and increased after incubation
with E2 (f2-fold) or R1881 (f4-fold; Fig. 6B). pCREB recruitment
was markedly reduced with the mutated promoter fragment and
was undetectable with the deleted promoter fragment, except for a
low signal observed after R1881 incubation (Fig. 6A).
Finally, we analyzed CREB occupancy on human IGF-IR promoter
by chromatin immunoprecipitation in LNCaP cells incubated in the
presence or the absence of sex steroids (10 nmol/L for 18 h).
Protein-DNA complexes were obtained by immunoprecipitation
with an anti-pCREB (Ser133) antibody and analyzed as indicated in
Materials and Methods. We found that a +119/+201 promoter
fragment, covering a predicted CREB site located in the human 5¶UTR fragment, was not only contained in the immunoprecipitated

protein-DNA complexes but also increased after sex steroid
treatment (Fig. 6B and C).

Discussion
Previously, we showed that both androgens and estrogens are
able to stimulate IGF-IR up-regulation in prostate cancer cells, thus
sensitizing cells to the biological effects of IGF-I (14, 15). Herein, we
show that CREB phosphorylation and activation is a key common
mechanism underlying IGF-IR promoter activation by sex steroids
in prostate cancer cells. This newly described mechanism of IGF-IR
up-regulation by sex steroid hormones is downstream the c-Src/
ERK and PI3K pathways. We have also identified the relevant CREBbinding sites, which are located in the 5¶-UTR of the IGF-IR
promoter and are required for this effect of sex steroids. Sex steroids
at nanomolar concentrations (0.1-1.0 nmol/L) phosphorylate CREB
at Ser113 in a dose- and time-dependent manner in prostate cancer
cells with a first peak after 30 to 60 min and a late peak after 18 h of
incubation. AR or ER mutants that do not bind to DNA are able to
induce CREB phosphorylation as well as the wild-type receptors,
confirming that genomic effects of steroids are not involved.
Moreover, sex steroid–induced CREB phosphorylation is inhibited
by MEK1 and Src inhibitors, confirming that the involvement of the
c-Src/ERK pathway. Sex steroids also specifically induced CRE

activity, which was also dependent on the c-Src/ERK pathway.
These findings are in agreement with data showing that CREB is a
substrate of p90Rsk, a kinase downstream ERK1/2 (26–28). Also,
PI3K inhibition blocked sex steroid effects on CREB phosphorylation and CRE activity. The involvement of this pathway appears to
be more important after E2 stimulation than after R1881, in
agreement with our previous findings (15). In contrast, inhibitors of
protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and calmodulin-dependent
kinase II kinases were ineffective. Very limited data are available on
CREB activation by androgens. It was reported previously that
dihydrotestosterone induces c-fos promoter activity in LNCaP cells
through a c-Src/MEK/ERK/CREB pathway (16). In the present
study, we extensively characterized CREB phosphorylation in
prostate cancer cells, showing that it is not cell type specific and
is also mediated by ARwt and not only by ART877A expressed in
LNCaP cells. Androgens were reported to induce CREB phosphorylation in Sertoli cells although at a 10- to 25-fold higher dose than
in the present study. In that study, CREB phosphorylation was
downstream ERK1/2 but not PI3K or protein kinase A (24).
CREB activation in response to estrogens has been studied in
brain, where it is involved in plasticity and resistance to apoptosis.

In hippocampal primary cell cultures, both mitogen-activated
protein kinase and calmodulin-dependent kinase II activities were
involved in CREB activation by estrogens (29), whereas, in
immortalized hippocampal cells, mitogen-activated protein kinase
and p90Rsk were the primary mediators (30). Our present work is
the first report indicating that E2 is able to phosphorylate and
activate CREB in prostate cancer cells. After phosphorylation at
Ser133, CREB binds to a conserved CREB responsive element, a
palindromic 8-bp sequence (TGACGTCA) found in the enhancer
regions of a variety of genes (31). We found that stimulation of CREB
phosphorylation and binding to CRE is a crucial step in IGF-IR upregulation by sex steroids, as CREB silencing abrogates CRE activity
as well as IGF-IR promoter activity and protein up-regulation.
The human IGF-IR promoter consists in a sequence of 1,557 bp,
including a 5¶-flanking region ( 518/ 1 fragment) and a 5¶-UTR
(+1/+1038 fragment). Both regions are highly GC-rich and show a
very high homology to the corresponding regions of the rat IGF-IR
gene (32), with 75% homology in the 5¶-flanking region and 85%
homology in the 5¶-UTR. Major regulators of the IGF-IR gene
include Sp1 transcription factor (33), WT1 (34), p53 (35, 36), and
caveolin (37). No effect of CREB has been reported previously.

Figure 6. pCREB recruitment to the IGF-IR promoter (DNA affinity precipitation assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation). A, pCREB binding to biotinylated
oligonucleotides containing either the wild-type CRE site (wt) or a mutated (M ) or a deleted (D ) sequence was carried out by DNA affinity precipitation assay (DAPA )
and analyzed by Western blotting using nuclear extracts of either unstimulated (B ) or E2- or R1881-treated LNCaP cells. pCREB recruitment to the wild-type promoter
probe was responsive to sex steroids and was markedly reduced or abolished in the mutated and deleted probes. INPUT, 10% of nuclear proteins; CTRL, aspecific
pCREB recruitment in the presence of unrelated DNA sequences (right ). B, LNCaP cells incubated or not with sex steroids were processed for chromatin
immunoprecipitation. PCR was carried out to detect the human IGF-IR promoter (top ) and the SOX-9 promoter (bottom , positive control). C, schematic representation
of the human IGF-IR proximal promoter region with the putative CREB-binding sites (ovals ) identified. INPUT, 10% of fragmented chromatin; pCREB, fragmented
chromatin immunoprecipitated with anti-pCREB (Ser133) antibody; IgG, fragmented chromatin immunoprecipitated with control IgG. Representative of three
independent experiments.

We have now identified the sex steroid–responsive CREB sites in
the 5¶-UTR promoter. In cells transfected with either ER subtypes
or ART877A, the sex steroid responsiveness of the 5¶-UTR fragment
was similar to that of the full-length promoter. Mutation of one
CREB site at the 5¶-UTR markedly reduced both basal and sex
steroid–stimulated promoter activity, whereas deletion of this
region completely abolished the response to sex steroids. The
crucial role of this sequence was further confirmed by DNA affinity
precipitation assay.
By chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, we also found that
protein-DNA complexes reacting with an anti-pCREB (Ser133)
antibody contained an 82-bp promoter fragment, in agreement
with a predicted CREB site located in the human 5¶-UTR fragment.
Interestingly, activation of the IGF-IR by IGFs may stimulate
CREB phosphorylation and regulate the expression of CREcontaining genes involved in growth and survival (38–40). Sex
steroid–mediated IGF-IR up-regulation may, therefore, activate a
loop of increased CREB phosphorylation and cell survival program.
In conclusion, we have identified, in prostate cancer cells, a
novel mechanism for IGF-IR promoter activation through CREB
phosphorylation induced by sex steroids via the c-Src/ERK
pathway. This mechanism enhances IGF downstream signaling
and biological effects and may occur not only in AR-positive but

also in AR-negative/ER-positive prostate cancer cells and in
malignant cells that express AR and/or ER mutants unable to
bind DNA. This novel mechanism enhances our understanding of
IGF-IR promoter regulation in prostate cancer cells and may open
a different approach to prostate cancer therapy, considering that
this effect is blocked by CREB silencing or by inhibitors of the cSrc/ERK/PI3K pathway rather than by the classic antiandrogen or
antiestrogen compounds (14, 15).
