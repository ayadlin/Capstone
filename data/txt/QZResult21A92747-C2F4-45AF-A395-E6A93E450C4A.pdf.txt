in G2/M Checkpoint Recovery

Abstract
CDC25B phosphatases must activate cyclin B-CDK1 complexes to restart the cell cycle after an arrest in G2
phase caused by DNA damage. However, little is known about the precise mechanisms involved in this process,
which may exert considerable impact on cancer susceptibility and therapeutic responses. Here we report the
discovery of novel N-terminally truncated CDC25B isoforms, referred to as DN-CDC25B, with an exclusively
nuclear and nonredundant function in cell cycle re-initiation after DNA damage. DN-CDC25B isoforms are
expressed from a distinct promoter not involved in expression of canonical full-length isoforms. Remarkably, in
contrast to the high lability and spatial dynamism of the full-length isoforms, DN-CDC25B isoforms are highly
stable and exclusively nuclear, strongly suggesting the existence of two pools of CDC25B phosphatases in the cell
that have functionally distinct properties. Using isoform-specific siRNA, we found that depleting full-length
isoforms, but not DN-CDC25B isoforms, delays entry into mitosis. Thus, in an unperturbed cell cycle, the fulllength isoforms are exclusively responsible for activating cyclin B-CDK1. Strikingly, in the late response to DNA
damage, we found a CHK1-dependent shift in accumulation of CDC25B isoforms toward the DN-CDC25B
species. Under this physiological stress condition, the DN-CDC25B isoform was found to play a crucial,
nonredundant function in restarting the cell cycle after DNA damage-induced G2 phase arrest. Our findings
reveal the existence of a previously unrecognized CDC25B isoform that operates specifically in the nucleus to
reinitiate G2/M transition after DNA damage. Cancer Res; 71(5); 1968–77. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
In mammals, there are 3 CDC25 phosphatases—CDC25A,
CDC25B, and CDC25C—(1, 2) which are believed to be partially functionally redundant in controlling mitotic entry (3, 4).
In the prevailing model, CDC25B has an exclusive role in the
initiation of cyclin B-CDK1 activation at the centrosome (5),
although not essential as its RNAi-mediated depletion only
results in a short delay in the entry into mitosis (5, 6). In
special physiological conditions in which the cell cycle has to
be restarted from an extended block, the functional redundancy between the 3 CDC25s is lost, and CDC25B is the only
member of the CDC25 family whose function becomes essential for mitotic entry. This notion stems in part from the fact
that in oocyte of female CDC25B-null mice, resumption of the

meiotic progression does not occur owing to a defect of
activation of cyclin B-CDK1 (7), a phenotype not observed
in a CDC25C-null background (8). Moreover, Medema and
colleagues have shown that CDC25B, but not CDC25A or
CDC25C, was critically required for the recovery from a
prolonged arrest in G2 induced by the activation of the
DNA damage checkpoint (9). What makes CDC25B so unique
among the CDC25s in activating cyclin B-CDK1 in the context
of a resumption of the cell cycle is currently unknown.
CDC25B is a very dynamic molecule that has been shown
to be subjected to a complex nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling
dependent on the combined effects of a nuclear localization
signal and a nuclear export sequence (10–12). There are
several lines of evidence showing that CDC25B is sequestered
in the cytoplasm in response to various cellular stresses (11,
13), especially those activating the p38-MK2 signaling (14).
The reason why the cell concentrates CDC25B in the cytoplasm in response to some stress, and the relationship
between cytoplasmic or nuclear compartmentalization and
the control of the phosphatase activity remain poorly understood. CDC25B has been described as a very unstable protein
whose degradation is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome
machinery (15, 16). The mechanism by which CDC25B is
directed to proteolysis involves a DDG motif, located in the
N-terminal regulatory domain, which plays a critical role in
the recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFßTrCp to the

phosphatase (17, 18). The degradation of CDC25B, which
determines the cellular level of the protein, seems to be
controlled by an intricate array of phosphorylation events
emanating from various signaling pathways (13, 19) still
sparsely characterized. The description of the regulation of
the level of CDC25B in response to genotoxic stress has led to
conflicting data (13, 20). These discrepancies stem from the
fact that CDC25B expression appears to be particularly sensitive to the nature and magnitude of the stress applied to the
cell, and most importantly from the lack of well characterized
CDC25B antibodies. In addition, because of the latter reason,
an accurate biochemical characterization of the CDC25B
isoforms present in the cell is still missing. To date, although
5 mRNA splice variants (CDC25B1 to B5) have been described
(21, 22), only CDC25B3 and CDC25B2 have been biochemically
detected in human cells (22).
Here, we have investigated the molecular diversity generated by CDC25B gene and identified a novel class of CDC25B
isoforms, nuclear, and functionally dedicated to the recovery
from the G2/M checkpoint. Besides raising the concept of the
existence of 2 molecular pools of CDC25B phosphatases with
opposite stability and nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking properties, our results point to novel regulatory modes of CDC25B,
and function in the nucleus critical for the resumption of the
cell cycle.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, transfection, synchronization, and
checkpoint recovery
U2OS and HCT116 cells were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 10% FCS. Plasmid DNA was transfected
using Jet PEI reagent (Poly Plus transfection). Thymidinesynchronization was carried out by treating the cells with 2.5
mmol/L thymidine (Sigma) either for 24 hours (simple block),
or 16 hours followed by a release of 15 hours, and readdition of
thymidine for 17 hours again (double block). Etoposide
(Sigma) was applied to the cells for one hour at a concentration of 40 mmol/L, before being washed extensively. Checkpoint recovery experiment was carried out essentially as
described (6). For protein stability studies, cycloheximide
(Sigma) and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Sigma) were
used at 50 mg/mL and 20 mmol/L, respectively.
Antibodies
Rabbit anti-CDC25B (C20), mouse monoclonal antiCDC25A (F6), anti-CyclinB1 (GNS1), anti-Chk1 (G4) were from
Santa Cruz; rabbit anti phospho H3 Ser-10 from Upstate
Biotechnology (Millipore), monoclonal mouse anti actin from
Chemicon and mouse monoclonal anti HA (HA. 11) from
Covance. The anti-CDC25B monoclonal antibody 19.29 was
generated by immunization with purified recombinant histidine-tagged CDC25B3. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti Adomain and B-domain were generated using synthetic peptides SETPKSQVGTLLF and ITNSQAPDGRRKSEA, respectively (Eurogentec). Secondary antibodies conjugated to
Alexa488 or Alexa594 were from Invitrogen. HRP conjugated
goat anti-Rabbit and anti-Mouse were from Cell Signaling.

Western blotting, and Immunofluorescence staining
Whole cell extracts for immunoprecipitation were prepared
by lysis of the cell in a buffer containing 50 mmol/L Tris HCl
pH 7.5, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% NP40, and
supplemented with proteases inhibitors. Clarified extracts
were incubated with anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche) overnight
at 4 C, and pulled down material was separated from the
beads by addition of SDS loading buffer. Western blots were
conducted using whole cell extracts obtained by lysing the
cells either in SDS PAGE loading buffer or in NP40 lysis buffer.
Proteins were separated using NuPAGE Bis Tris gradient
precasted gels (Invitrogen), and transfered to Nitrocellulose.
U2OS tet-off expressing CDC25B3-HA or CDC25B55-HA were
grown on coverslips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and
permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X100, and immunostained
using anti-HA antibody.
Plasmids
Plasmid vectors allowing the expression of C-terminally
HA-tagged CDC25B3, B6, and B7 were obtained by PCRamplifying their respective coding sequences using the forward primers B3-Bam 50 -attggatccaccatggaggtgccccagccggagc-30 or B6-Bam 50 -ttaggatccaccatggattcccccagccctatg-30
associated with 25B-HA XhoI 50 -tatctcgagttaagcgtaatctggaacatcgtatgggtagatatcctggtcct-gcagccggctacagagc-3 0 and cloning the resulting PCR fragments to the BamH1-XhoI sites
of the vector pCDNA3.1þ.
Flow cytometry
Cells were harvested and fixed with cold 70% ethanol. They
were subsequently stained with either anti-phospho H3 Ser-10
antibodies or the monoclonal 3.12.I.22 (23) that were revealed
using Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated antibodies. DNA was stained
with Propidium Iodide (Sigma). DNA content and mitotic
index were determined using a FACScalibur flow cytometer
(BD).
siRNA-mediated knockdown
siRNA were transfected using Interferin reagent (Poly Plus
transfection) at a final concentration of 1 to 3 nmol/L. The
mRNA sequences targeted by the siRNAs used in this study
are: siRNA CDC25B: agacugcagauaccccuau, siRNA 55: gcgugaccuugauugaguu, siRNA 65: aggcucggcucucagucca, siRNA
CHK1 (24). Nontargeting control siRNA and Smart Pool siRNA
to Plk1 were purchased from Dharmacon.
Sequence database search
The visualization of the cDNA sequences aligning to the
CDC25B gene locus was achieve using Blat search from UCSC
genome browser (25).

(C20 and 19.29) directed against 2 different domains of
CDC25B (see Fig. 1C). Both antibodies produced a similar
signal pattern depicted in Figure 1A consisting in 2 band
doublets migrating at an apparent molecular weight of 65 and
61 kDa for the slowest migrating pair (Fig. 1A, band 65 and 61),
and 55 and 52 kDa for the fastest (Fig. 1A, band 55 and 52). The
fact that those electrophoretic species were specifically
depleted in cells transfected with a siRNA targeting CDC25B
mRNA (Fig. 1B) excluded the possibility of nonspecific signals
and hence showed that they corresponded to bona fide
CDC25B molecules. We next used 2 antibodies directed
against either the A- or B-domain of CDC25B, both localized
in the N-terminal regulatory domain (Fig. 1C; see the schematic representation of the primary structure of CDC25B),
and absent in CDC25B1 and CDC25B2 isoforms, respectively
(21). Remarkably, the antibodies to the most N-terminal Adomain failed to recognize the 55 kDa species whereas those
against the more C-terminal B-domain did bind to it showing
that this molecular species corresponds to a N-terminal
truncation of CDC25B whose amino-terminal extremity maps
between the A- and B-domains (Fig. 1C). We were not able to
characterize the 52 kDa species primary structure using this
approach because it co-migrated with the IgG heavy chains.
The fact that the 65 kDa signal displayed the epitopes of the 4
antibodies to CDC25B used in our study, and the 61 kDa
CDC25B signal was specifically ignored by the anti-B domain
antibodies (although recognized by the anti-A domain)
(Fig. 1C), identified these 2 molecular species, collectively
referred hereafter to as full-length CDC25B (Fl-CDC25B), as
CDC25B3 and CDC25B2, respectively. We next assessed to
which extent the repertory of isoforms identified above was
present in various tumoral and nontumoral human cell lines
(described in Table S1). As shown in Figure 1D, although each
cell line expressed a unique pattern of CDC25B molecules, the
65 kDa CDC25B3 isoform seemed to constitute the major
isoform present in every cell lines. Most importantly, the 55
kDa and to a lower extent the 52 kDa species were detected in
most of, but not all, the cell lines analyzed, excluding the
possibility of a narrow range of expression restrained to the
HCT116. Thus, using classical immunoblotting approach, we
have been able to detect 4 distinct CDC25B isoforms in human
cells. Whereas our data identified the doublet of higher
molecular weight as CDC25B3 and B2, the 2 molecular species
of lower apparent molecular weight did not exhibit the
molecular weight and reactivity to antibodies features of
the known CDC25B molecules suggesting that they correspond to uncharacterized isoforms. They were called
CDC25B6 (55 kDa) and B7 (52 kDa) according to the current
CDC25B isoforms nomenclature (see Table 1 for details).

of CDC25B initiating from the methionine-113 (CDC25B3
numbering). RT-PCR experiments confirmed the existence
of these P1 mRNAs in various human cell lines including
U2OS and HCT116 (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, PCR produced 2
major amplicons (488 and 365 bp) whose sequence analysis
revealed that P1 mRNAs occur as 2 major splice variants
(Fig. 2A) encoding for Met113-truncated versions of CDC25B3
and B2 (Fig. 2D). We next aimed to investigate whether

the existence of 2 promoters referred to as P1, and P2 (see
Fig. 2A). Although P2 transcripts encoded the canonical
CDC25B isoforms (Fig. 2A), P1 promoted mRNAs were characterized by the fact that the conventional ATG codon was
removed by the splicing of the first intron, shifting the initiation of translation to the third exon (Fig. 2A). The open reading

CDC25B6 and B7 isoforms were generated from these P1
mRNAs (Fig. 2A). We designed a siRNA specifically affecting
the transcripts generated from P1 (Fig. 2A; siRNA 55), and
ignoring P2 mRNAs, using a sequence within the first exon of
the P1 mRNAs. When transfected to the cells, CDC25B6 and
B7 were depleted whereas Fl-CDC25B isoforms level
remained unaffected (Fig. 2C, lane 55). Conversely, transfection of a siRNA designed to specifically target the P2 mRNAs
(see Fig. 2A; siRNA 65) resulted in a strong reduction of FlCDC25B level whereas CDC25B6 and B7 were left almost
unaffected (Fig. 2C, lanes 65), suggesting that P2 mRNAs
exclusively produce Fl-CDC25B molecules. We concluded
from these results that the B6 and B7 isoforms originate
from P1 mRNAs. Taken with the characterization of the
sequences of the P1 mRNAs, we deduced the primary
structures of CDC25B6 and B7 as those of CDC25B3 and
CDC25B2 translated from the Met113, respectively. This class
of truncated isoforms will be collectively referred hereafter
to as DN-CDC25B by opposition to full-length (Fl) variants
(see Table 1).

DN-CDC25B isoforms are nuclear and stable
CDC25B phosphatases are viewed as very dynamic molecules subjected to a constant nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (10,
26), associated with a high turnover (16). To our surprise,
although DN-CDC25B contains the DDG degron described by
Kanemori and collaborators (17), treatment for one hour with
the proteasome inhibitor MG132 did not affect significantly
the amount of DN-CDC25B whereas under the same treatment, the level of Fl-CDC25B, as well as that of CDC25A (used
here as a highly labile protein control) dramatically increased
(Fig. 3A). These results suggested that DN-CDC25B was much
less prone to degradation by the proteasome than its fulllength counterpart. In order to confirm this observation, and
visualize the kinetics of degradation, cycloheximide chase
experiments were conducted in U2OS and HCT116 cells.
Inhibition of protein synthesis resulted in a rapid disappearance of Fl-CDC25B whereas CDC25B6 and B7 level remained
remarkably stable even 3 hours after addition of cycloheximide (Fig. 3B and C). We next sought to determine CDC25B6

antibodies to CDC25B capable of detecting the endogenous
isoforms in immunostaining, the localization of ectopically
expressed HA-tagged CDC25B6, B7, and B3 was determined
using an anti-HA antibody. In agreement with the lack of
nuclear export sequence (NES), we found that both CDC25B6
and CDC25B7 localized to the nucleus (Fig. 3D). In contrast,
and in line with our previous results (10), CDC25B3-HA
exhibited a pan-cellular localization (Fig. 3D, left panels).
Taken together, our data revealed that the DN-CDC25B isoforms are characterized by a behavior opposite to that of the
Fl-CDC25B molecules as they exhibit a particularly low turnover in addition to be compartmentalized in the nucleus.

Specific depletion of DN-CDC25B does not delay entry
into mitosis
It is established that, in an otherwise unperturbed cell cycle,
the knockdown of CDC25B results in a delay of about a couple
of hours in the entry into mitosis (5, 6). We thus sought to
address the specific contribution of each class of CDC25B
molecules in this phenotype using our isoform-specific siRNAs
(see Fig. 2B). U2OS cells were transfected with the relevant
siRNAs, and subsequently synchronized with thymidine
(Fig. 4A). The efficacy of the siRNA-mediated depletion of
Fl-CDC25B and/or DN-CDC25B 10 hours after release from
synchronization was validated by Western blot analysis

with control siRNA (Fig 4B, siRNA CDC25B versus siRNA
control). Remarkably, although transfection of the siRNA 65
resulted in a similar delay in the reduction of the 4N DNA
content, interfering with the expression of DN-CDC25B did
not produce any significant inhibition of the evolution of the
DNA content when compared to the control siRNA (Fig. 4B;
siRNA 65 versus siRNA 55). We reached identical conclusion
using a similar experimental set-up in which nocodazole was
added after release from thymidine block in order to follow the
accumulation of mitotic cells. In this experimental approach,
again, the siRNA 55 was the sole siRNA to CDC25B not to delay
the kinetic of accumulation of mitotic cells versus the control.
We concluded from these results that the full-length species is
the class of CDC25B isoforms functioning in the mitotic entry
network. In addition, our results support the idea that they
cannot be replaced by the DN-CDC25B species in this function. Moreover, if DN-CDC25B plays any role in the entry into
mitosis, this function can be fulfilled by Fl-CDC25B.
CHK1-dependent upregulation of DN-CDC25B
associated with the response to DNA damage
In the context of a prolonged G2/M block induced by the
DNA damage checkpoint, a critical role for CDC25B in the
resumption of cell cycle has been identified (6). Moreover Lazo
and collaborators have described an accumulation of CDC25B
following UV and various DNA damage (20) that had been
interpreted as an anticipatory event toward cell cycle resumption, although the nature of the CDC25B molecules visualized
in this study remains elusive. We thus found important to
examine how the 2 classes of isoforms are expressed one
versus the other especially during the response to DNA
damage. To start, we examined the dynamic of expression
of the CDC25B isoforms during progression of the cell cycle in
the context of a release from a double thymidine block. As
shown in Figure 5A, we found a clear dissociation between FlCDC25B and DN-CDC25B expressions. The latter was found
present throughout the cell cycle with a peak of accumulation
during S-phase, whereas Fl-CDC25B expression was restricted
to G2 and mitosis. We next followed the dynamic of the
expression of the CDC25B isoforms after treatment with
etoposide. Four hours after release from the genotoxic, FlCDC25B started to decline before starting rising back from 12
hours after treatment while in contrast, the level of DNCDC25B progressively increased (Fig. 5B). Twenty-four hours
after etoposide treatment, DN-CDC25B species had dramatically accumulated in the cells so that the ratio between FlCDC25B and DN-CDC25B species had reversed compared with
untreated cells. This phenomenology was not specific to
etoposide as ionizing radiation resulted in the same CDC25B
expression shift in U2OS cells (supplementary Fig. S1A). Moreover, we made a similar observation in HCT116 treated with
etoposide (supplementary Fig. S1B). We quantified the variation of the amount of P1 and P2 mRNAs occurring 24 hours

1974

Cancer Res; 71(5) March 1, 2011

after etoposide treatment by quantitative RT-PCR, and found
a 1.4-fold increase in the P1 mRNAs whereas the quantity of P2
mRNA remained stable (Fig. 5C). This result showed that the
increase of DN-CDC25B isoforms seen in the late response to
DNA damage is linked (at least in part) to a transcriptional
effect. We next sought to get insight about the mechanism
controlling the expression of Fl-CDC25B and DN-CDC25B
species in the context of the DNA damage response by
examining the consequence of the invalidation of CHK1.
We found that interfering with the expression of CHK1
resulted in the abrogation of the accumulation of DN-CDC25B
in the late response to etoposide (Fig. 5D; lanes 24), whereas
the transient collapse of Fl-CDC25B molecules 8 hours after
etoposide pulse was not significantly affected compared with
the control siRNA (Fig. 5D; lanes 8). We deduced from those
results that CHK1 is required to increase DN-CDC25B expression after genotoxic stress whereas it does not seem to control
Fl-CDC25B level under this circumstance. We thus concluded
that the 2 classes of CDC25B isoforms are expressed independently from one other, and that DN-CDC25B specifically
accumulates, in a CHK1-dependent mechanism, during the
late response to genotoxic stress. This observation raised the
possibility that DN-CDC25B molecules may play a role associated with this particular physiological state.
DN-CDC25B and Fl-CDC25B isoforms are both required
for the G2/M checkpoint recovery
The incapacity to recover from a prolonged checkpointinduced G2 block is the most prominent phenotype of cells in
which CDC25B function has been abrogated (6). We thus
sought to characterize the specific contribution of Fl-CDC25B
and DN-CDC25B in the G2/M checkpoint recovery process
using an experimental set up (Fig. 6A) initially developed by
Medema and collaborators (6). U2OS cells transfected with the
isoform-specific or control siRNAs, were treated with etoposide while progressing through G2. After 18 hours of block in
G2, a synchronous resumption of the cell cycle was simulated
by the addition of caffeine, an inhibitor of the ATR and ATM
kinases. We validated the efficiency of the siRNA-mediated
depletion of each isoforms of CDC25B by Western blotting
(Fig. 6B). In line with published data (6), 6 hours after addition
of caffeine, whereas a substantial part of the cells transfected
with the control siRNA had entered into mitosis, the depletion
of all the CDC25B isoforms, and PLK1 knockdown, both
resulted in a strong abrogation of the recovery (Fig 6C;
compare control with CDC25B and PLK1). Remarkably, a
similar inhibition of caffeine-induced entry into mitosis was
observed after specific knockdown of DN-CDC25B, or FlCDC25B (Fig. 6C; siRNA 55 and 65). Importantly, the recovery
phenotype associated with the siRNA 65 and 55 was rescued
by ectopically expressing nontargetable versions of CDC25B3
and CDC25B6, respectively (supplementary Fig. S2), excluding
the possibility of off target effects. We therefore concluded
that the expression of both Fl-CDC25B and DN-CDC25B was
required for the recovery from the G2/M checkpoint. Moreover, these results identified a function for DN-CDC25B,
exerted when the cell cycle is restarted after a prolonged
establishment of the G2/M checkpoint.

Western blotting.

Discussion
To date, little effort has been done to characterize the
CDC25B polypeptides diversity expressed in human cells.
Yet this knowledge is essential for our full understanding of
how CDC25B functions, and the regulation of its activity.
We have discovered the existence of a N-terminally truncated class of CDC25B isoforms, co-expressed along with the

www.aacrjournals.org

canonical full-length variants in the cell. Although the human
CDC25B promoter has so far never been characterized, our
data reveal the existence of 2 CDC25B promoters, P1 and P2,
which seem to control separately the expression of DN- and FlCDC25B isoforms, respectively. This notion is consistent with
the apparent independent dynamics of expression-level of
each class of isoforms observed during the progression of
the cell cycle and the response to genotoxic stress, although

mechanisms other than transcriptional regulation, like protein stability, are likely to contribute to this differential control. Most importantly, we show that CHK1 is involved in the
upregulation of DN-CDC25B level during the response to
genotoxic stress, a result consistent with the checkpointdependent induction of CDC25B described by Banzal and Lazo
(20). The nature of the CHK1-dependent mechanisms that
stimulate transcription from P1 promoter, and whose effect
take place hours after DNA damage remain to be established.
Conceptually, our results reveal a unique regulation mode of
CDC25B in response to DNA damage in which CHK1 in one
hand negatively regulates CDC25B activity to establish the
checkpoint (24, 27), and on the other hand participates in the
upregulation of the expression of special isoforms of the same
positive regulator of the cell cycle, presumably as an anticipatory event toward the resumption of the cell cycle.
The fact that DN-CDC25B escapes degradation while containing the DDG degron (17) reveals that the latter, yet
necessary, is not sufficient for targeting CDC25B to the
proteasome, and shows that the first 113 residues domain
of the full length isoforms contains essential structural and/or
regulatory determinants of CDC25B degradation.
Our finding that specific knockdown of the Fl-CDC25B
isoforms, but not that of DN-CDC25B, results in the same
delayed entry into mitosis phenotype observed after full depletion of CDC25B (5, 6) identifies the canonical full length species
as the isoforms in charge of initiating the activation of cyclin BCDK1 at the centrosome. The fact that this function cannot be
fulfilled by the DN-CDC25B isoforms alone may results from
their inability to access to the cytoplasmic centrosomal pool of
cyclin B-CDK1 owing to their nuclear compartmentalization.
The absence of cell cycle progression phenotype associated
with the knockdown of the DN-CDC25B isoforms raises the
question of their function, if any, during an unperturbed cell
division cycle, and may explain why their level of expression
was found below the detection threshold in some cell lines.
Remarkably, our results reveal that DN-CDC25B isoforms
become essential for the G2/M transition when the cell cycle

is restarted after a prolonged G2/M block induced by the
DNA damage checkpoint (6), a function consistent with the
dramatic increase of DN-CDC25B level observed under this
physiological state. This accumulation is not a matter of
simply maintaining or increasing the level of CDC25B phosphatase in the cell. Indeed, the 2 classes of isoforms do not
seem to be functionally redundant (at least at physiological
level of expression; see supplementary Fig. S2) as DN-CDC25B,
which constitutes approximately 95% of the total pool of
CDC25B 18 hours after DNA damage, fails to support the
recovery in cells depleted for Fl-CDC25B.
The consideration that, in cells blocked G2, cyclin B is
mainly cytoplasmic whereas cyclin A resides in the nucleus
(28), suggests that the substrate of DN-CDC25B might be
cyclin A-CDK complexes. This idea is in line with a recent
report (29) revealing that cyclin A-CDK activity has to be
maintained to a certain level during the establishment of the
checkpoint to allow the activation of FoxM1, a transcription
factor whose activity is critical for the recovery (30). Our
findings suggest a model in which DN-CDC25B would be
dedicated variants of CDC25B that would keep the cyclin
A-CDK activity above a critical threshold required for the
resumption of the cell-cycle.
