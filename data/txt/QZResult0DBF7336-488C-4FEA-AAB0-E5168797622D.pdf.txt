Abstract
The paucity of clinical treatment data on rare tumors, such as
mesenchymal chondrosarcoma (MCS), emphasizes the need in
theranostic tools for these diseases. We put forward and
validated a new theranostic method, combining tumor
xenografts and mathematical models, and used it to suggest
an improved treatment schedule for a particular MCS patient.
Growth curves and gene expression analysis of xenografts,
derived from a patient’s lung metastasis, served for creating a
mathematical model of MCS progression and adapting it to
the xenograft setting. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of six drugs were modeled, with model variables
being adjusted by patient-specific chemosensitivity tests. The
xenografted animals were treated by various monotherapy
and combination schedules, and the MCS xenograft model was
computer simulated under the same treatment scenario. The
mathematical model for xenograft growth was then up-scaled
to retrieve the MCS patient’s tumor progression under
different treatment schedules. An average accuracy of 87.1%
was obtained when comparing model predictions with the
observed tumor growth inhibition in the xenografted animals.
Simulation results suggested that a regimen containing
bevacizumab applied i.v. in combination with once-weekly
docetaxel would be more efficacious in the MCS patient than
all other simulated schedules. Weekly docetaxel in the patient
resulted in stable metastatic disease and relief of pancytopenia due to tumor infiltration. We suggest that the advantage of
weekly docetaxel on the triweekly regimen is directly related
to the angiogenesis rate of the tumor. Further validation of
this conclusion, and the theranostic method we provide, may
facilitate personalization of solid cancer pharmacotherapy.

Introduction
Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma (MCS) is a rare disease that
accounts for about 1% of all chondrosarcomas. Overall, 5-year
survival is 55%. This disease usually follows an aggressive course,
with a high rate of distant metastases (1, 2). Lack of efficacious

therapies for this and other rare tumors that progress rapidly
accentuates the need to develop accurate, predictive personalization tools in a timely fashion.
Prediction of personalized therapy, or theranostics, is the process
of selecting the best treatment for a given patient by accounting for
patient-specific factors, such as gender, age, and genetic characteristics. A possible theranostic solution is to assess the relative
efficacy of various treatments in laboratory animals, which bear the
patient’s cancer (3). However, xenograft models suffer from three
major impediments: slow, costly, and labor-intensive cellular
acquisition from tumor biopsies and xenograft growth; animal
physiology not reflecting the human pharmacokinetics (PK); and
xenograft methods not accounting for patient safety.
Underlying these impediments is the complexity of the involved
dynamics due to which one cannot estimate, by intuition alone, the
relationships between measurable molecular biomarkers and the
behavior of the organism as a whole. In contrast, mathematical
models formally and systematically describe the major biological
processes that relate the measured biomarkers to the phenotype in
question. By integrating these mathematical models into comprehensive computer algorithms, one can compute what will be the
effect on the phenotype of changes, even small changes, in
biomarker levels. In theranostics, laboratory experiments in
xenografted animals could be used in conjunction with mathematical models for the pathologic and physiologic growth
dynamics and for drug PK and pharmacodynamics (PD).
Mathematical models for tumor progression (4–6), cancer
therapy (7–10), and related genetic (11, 12), hematologic (13, 14),
and immunologic processes (15, 16) have been developed. Using
these models, the efficacy of various drug monotherapy and
combination schedules was predicted (7, 8, 14, 15, 17, 18). These
computer-implemented models allow clinicians to analyze the
effects of drug regimens on disease progression, as well as provide
the power to check various biomarkers for their suitability to
represent different aspects of the disease in question. New methods
for treatment optimization have also been developed, which grade
the therapeutic potential of specific regimens according to clinical
criteria, such as efficacy/toxicity ratio (17, 19). The biological
process models, in conjunction with the optimization methods,
introduce into clinical oncology a quantitative prediction-based
decision-making facility.
Several preclinical and clinical trials have been carried out for
testing the prediction accuracy of mathematical model for tumor
progression (20–24). In the present work, we applied a validated
model for vascular tumor progression (see below) to create a novel
theranostic method for a large class of anticancer drugs. The
method was validated in xenografts derived from a MCS patient’s

lung metastasis and then used for predicting an improved therapy
for the patient himself.
By controlling its variable values, the validated model was
adapted to describe the metastatic tumor growth of a specific MCS
patient as well as of its xenografted biopsy. We used these two new
models to analyze the reasons underlying the relative advantage of
one treatment option over another.

Materials and Methods
The Patient
A 45-y-old white male was in excellent health until a growing mediastinal
mass was found in 2004. His primary tumor was resected and identified
histologically as MCS. Despite the initial resection, multiple new bilateral
pulmonary nodules were discovered 30 d after the operation. Despite
aggressive chemotherapy with ifosphamide, cisplatin, and etoposide for six
cycles, VACA (vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and dactinomycin) for 2 cycles, and sunitinib p.o. for 8 wk, the patient progressed with
additional liver and bone metastases. As a consequence of prolonged
chemotherapy and documented bone marrow infiltration, the patient
suffered severe myelosuppression with pancytopenia.

Study Design
The workflow of this study is described schematically in Supplementary
Fig. S1.
Tumor fragments were taken from lung metastases of the MCS patient
and implanted in mice. This xenograft model was established and amplified
until sufficient tumor was available to implant a control and several
treatment groups. In this model, cells are only propagated directly as
smaller pieces from a previous xenograft and never propagated as a cell line.
Mice were divided into groups, each treated by different drug regimen, in
addition to a control group of untreated animals. In parallel to the
laboratory work, a general mathematical model for vascular tumor growth
dynamics was adapted to describe the growth of untreated xenografts of the
MCS patient’s lung metastases. In silico experiments, similar to those
performed in vivo, were conducted to predict growth of MCS xenografts and
their response to various drug therapies. This was done by simulating the
adapted tumor growth model in conjunction with the relevant PK/PD
models and the particular dosing regimens. Where available, patientspecific chemosensitivity information was used to fine-tune the PD models.
Otherwise, only publicly available data were used for the mathematical PK
and PD models of the drugs in the xenograft experiments. Following the
initial assessment of model prediction accuracy (25), the variables of several
drug models were reevaluated and the accuracy was assessed again.
Subsequently, the mathematical model was adjusted to describe the
patient’s metastatic growth dynamics. This was done using gene expression
analysis of key proteins in mice and human and various treatment regimens
were tested for efficacy in the MCS patient.

Experimental Setup
Immunohistochemistry. Tissue from the primary sarcoma was
removed after surgery and fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded
in paraffin. Tissue sections of 5 Am were deparaffinized in xylene and
rehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol. Endogenous peroxidase
activity was quenched with 0.01% H2O2, sections were boiled in 0.01 mol/L
citric acid (pH 6.0), and nonspecific binding was blocked with 10% normal
rabbit serum. After washing, rat anti-mouse CD34 monoclonal primary
antibody (PharMingen) specific to vascular endothelium was applied at
25 Ag/mL and incubated overnight at 4jC. After washing in PBS,
biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse antibody, diluted 1:100, was applied followed
by incubation at room temperature for 30 min. After washing again in PBS,
avidin-biotin complex (Vector Laboratories), diluted 1:25, was applied and
incubated at room temperature for 30 min and washed again in PBS. Tissue
sections were developed with diaminobenzidine and peroxide and counterstained with hematoxylin. Microvessel density (MVD) was assessed by
counting the microvessels at 200 in a field that had the highest
vascularization by scanning at 40 (12) and then converted to MVD/

mm2. Stained slides were examined blind and were also scored from one to
four with increasing vascularity.
Animal model. For establishment and propagation, tumor fragments
obtained from the MCS patient were s.c. implanted using an 11-gauge
cancer trocar on the right flank of male CD-1 nude mice, as we assumed
that mouse flank provides a good mirror of primary sarcoma growth in the
soft tissue microenvironment of the patient from which it originated. Mice
were weighed twice weekly and tumor measurements were taken with a
Vernier caliper twice weekly, beginning 7 d after implantation. Tumors were
considered established once growth reached log stage as determined by
tumor measurements. Once established tumors reached a predetermined
volume (1–3 cm3), they were excised and sectioned into 15 to 30 mm3
fragments, which were implanted s.c. as above; implantation was unilateral
on the right flank. Once tumors grew to 50 to 150 mm3 in size, animals were
pair matched by tumor size into treatment and control groups. The animals
were ear tagged and followed individually throughout each experiment.
Data collection and analysis. Tumor volume was calculated by
conversion of two-dimensional caliper measurements as follows (19):
1
V ¼ W 2L
2

ðAÞ

where V, W, and L are the tumor volume, width, and length, respectively.
Mean tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of each treated group was compared
with vehicle control and a TGI value was calculated using the following
formula:


T  T0
ðBÞ
TGIð%Þ ¼ 100  1 
C  C0
where T 0 and C 0 are initial tumor sizes of the treated and the control tumor,
respectively, and T and C are sizes of treated or control tumor, respectively.
In vitro proliferation assays. Patient-specific tumor cells were obtained
from xenografts, generated by inoculation of lung metastases into
immunocompromised mice, which were collected when they had grown
beyond 150 mm3 in size. The tumors were minced into small pieces
(<1 mm), digested for 2 h with collagenase-DNase, mechanically dissociated,
and passed through sterile nylon mesh to produce single-cell suspensions.
Viable tumor cells were enriched by elutriation and Ficoll-diatrizoate
density centrifugations (26). Tumor cell suspensions were plated in
microtiter wells (50,000 per well) and incubated in the presence or absence
of the indicated drugs or combinations for 4 d in 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; ref. 27) or 7 d in the differential
staining cytotoxicity (DiSC; ref. 28) assays.

Mathematically Modeling Vascular Tumor Growth
A mathematical model of angiogenesis-dependent tumor dynamics and
its underlying assumptions is described in detail elsewhere (4, 5, 24). The
reader is referred to Fig. 1 in ref. 24 for a schematic representation of the
model. The model describes three main interactive growth dynamics: of
tumor cells, of blood vessel formation (angiogenesis), and of new vessel
maturation.
Generally, our model assumes that the tumor volume is formed by living
cells, which undergo mitosis or death, and dying cells, which are
progressively eliminated. The living cells consume nutrients and secrete
proteins that affect angiogenesis. We distinguish between two types of
vessels, mature and immature, which differ in their perfusion efficiency.
Mature vessels are coated by pericytes, mesenchymal-like cells, which
support these vessels and enable improved blood flow (29, 30). The
immature vessels are only tubes of endothelial cells, which are more ‘‘leaky’’
than the mature ones, and conduct oxygen and nutrients less effectively to
the tumor (31, 32). Another property of immature vessels in our model is
their higher degradation tendency. The degree of tumor vascularization
strongly affects its growth rate: higher and more effective vascularization
triggers vigorous proliferation of tumor cells while inhibiting angiogenesis.
In contrast, insufficient vasculature causes hypoxia and starvation of the
tumor tissue, thus inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting angiogenesis
(33–37). Four proteins that are related to angiogenesis are modeled:

Weekly Docetaxel
where E max and E min are the bounding maximum and minimum effects,
respectively, and C max and C min are the respective drug concentrations
that cause these effects.
The model of drug effect depends on its actual mechanism of action. For
example, the effect of a cytotoxic drug, such as docetaxel, is modeled as a
fraction of cells that are killed during the current time step (Eqs. C and D).
Thus, in the context of docetaxel, E max and E min (Eqs. C and D) are taken as
1 and 0, respectively. The overall effect on treated tumor shrinkage
compared with the untreated tumor is calculated by Eq. B.
The variable identification of the MCS model and the various PK and PD
models was performed using a cross-entropy method, described in ref. 43,
as well as experimental records of xenograft dynamic and publicly available
PK data. The sources for PK and PD data can be found in Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2, respectively.

Personalizing PK/PD Models Using Xenograft Experiments

vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGF), angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2). The growth
factor VEGF drives angiogenesis by inducing endothelial cell proliferation
and by serving as a survival factor for immature vessels. PDGF drives
maturation by inducing the proliferation of pericytes, which coat the
immature vessels and turn them mature. The proteins Ang-1 and Ang-2 also
affect the processes of vessel maturation and destabilization. The protein
Ang-1 promotes vessel maturation by facilitating the binding of free
pericytes to the extracellular matrix. In contrast, Ang-2 causes pericyte
dropout, thus promoting vessel destabilization (38, 39).

Personalizing the MCS Patient Model
The growth of six untreated xenografts was monitored for estimating the
variables of the MCS patient tumor model when xenografted in mice. Only
three of them actually grew in size. Results of histopathologic assays of the
patient’s lung metastasis (e.g., tumor density, mitotic index, necrotic index,
and vessel density) were used to define valid variable ranges in the
evaluation process. Twelve model variables common to all the xenografts
were evaluated. In addition, two variables, which represent the vascular bed
at implantation site, were evaluated for each xenograft individually. Two
additional xenograft growth curves were monitored for validating model
predictability.

Mathematically Modeling PK/PD
We adopted linear compartmental PK models for all the drugs in this
study (see refs. 40, 41 for general reviews on compartmental PK modeling).
Each effect of the drug is mathematically defined as a function of drug
concentration in a predefined model compartment. In general, the
concentration-effect relationship is defined using a sigmoid function (42):
Emax  Emin
EðCÞ ¼ Emax 
1 þ ðC=Cnor Þm

ðCÞ

where E is the measured effect at the given plasma concentration C;
E max and E min are the maximal and the minimal possible effects,
respectively; C nor is the drug concentration that produces the effect that
equals to the average of E max and E min; and m is the curve slope at the
point [C nor; E(C nor)]. However, when the available information does not
permit a reliable reconstruction of the variables for the sigmoid function,
a more simplistic linear relationship is used:

Six drugs and their combinations were tested in mice bearing xenografts
from the patient’s cancer tissue to determine the best possible treatment:
bevacizumab, docetaxel, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, irinotecan (CPT-11), and
sorafenib. Results of in vitro proliferation assays of the patient’s tumor cells
were used to establish patient-specific concentration-effect curves for the
chemotherapeutics (docetaxel, gemcitabine, CPT-11, doxorubicin, and
docetaxel/gemcitabine combination). Two different concentrations of each
drug were tested, enabling to construct linear dose-response functions
(Eq. D). Response was measured using DiSC and MTT methods and
concentration-effect equations were constructed separately for each
method and then averaged. For docetaxel and gemcitabine/docetaxel, only
DiSC results were used for parameterization. These data were modeled as
the fraction of cells killed during the current time step.
Modeling PD of targeted drugs (bevacizumab and sorafenib) was based
on relevant data of treated lung cancer xenografts and was implemented as
a sigmoid dependence (Eq. C). In our mathematical model, we included
bevacizumab single-action mechanism as a VEGF inhibitor and that of
sorafenib triple-action mechanism (i.e., direct inhibition of tumor
maturation, inhibition of pericyte activity, and decreasing the cell
proliferation rate). The estimated individualized PD was combined with
the corresponding PK to yield a complete PK/PD model. No PK
individualization was performed in this work.
To model drug combinations, the independent effects of each drug in the
combination were added. An additive effect was assumed due to lack of
quantitative information on potential PK/PD interactions. An exception is
the case of docetaxel/gemcitabine combination, where data from the
patient-specific in vitro proliferation assays were available. Theoretically, the
combined effects of docetaxel and gemcitabine may be synergistic or
antagonistic depending on the type of tumor cells and on the order of drug
administration (44, 45). PK interactions are partially responsible for the
dependence of the combined effect on drug sequencing (45). As the
chemosensitivity tests are PK independent, and due to the shortage of
quantitative data, we assumed that no PD interactions exist between the
modeled drugs.

Simulating MCS Xenograft Dynamics and Response to Drug
Treatment
The full PK/PD models of numerous therapy schedules were simulated
in conjunction with the MCS xenograft model. Mouse body weight was
taken as 30 g. Efficacy was measured in terms of TGI (Eq. B). As stated
above, necrotic tumor cells do not disappear from the system
immediately, but are eliminated with a finite rate, and therefore
contribute to tumor volume. Thus, the control and treated tumor sizes
in Eq. B may refer to the total number of cells, or to living cells alone,
resulting in TGI values that consider the tumor volume as a whole (TGIT)
or only the living fraction (TGIL).
Xenograft simulations were carried out for a period of 22 d, similar to the
period for TGI calculations in the experimental setup.

Validating the Model Predictions
Growth of MCS xenografts treated under various therapies was
monitored for 22 d after treatment initiation. Model prediction accuracy

Following the initial assessment of prediction accuracy, the PK and PD
models of each drug were independently revisited by detailing the action
mechanisms of the involved biological drug models and by additional
refinement of PK/PD variables. Only publicly available data were used in this
process. Unlike the original models, the reviewing process was performed only
after receiving the experimental xenograft sensitivity. However, these were
blinded in the refinement process. Thus, the results below may be regarded as
prospective ones. Results of the initial assessment are also reported (25).

The personalized disease model of the MCS xenografts served as the
basis for the human model. Gene expression analyses of key proteins (e.g.,
VEGF; ref. 46) in the patient’s metastases and in the xenografted tumor
(denoted as Met/F1 ratio) were used to scale relevant xenograft variables.
For example, gene expression analysis shows that the Met/F1 ratio of Ang-2
is 0.7. Therefore, values of corresponding variables in the xenograft model
were multiplied by this coefficient to yield a new value in the human model.
Published data on the involved drugs were used to model their PK in
human. We assumed that administering equivalent doses to a mouse and a
human would result in effects of similar maximum magnitude but with
different time profiles. Therefore, the same PD functions used in mice
modeling were used in human models [i.e., patient-specific concentrationeffect curves for cytotoxic drugs (CPT-11, docetaxel, doxorubicin, and
gemcitabine) and literature-based functions for bevacizumab and sorafenib]. Note that for simplicity we describe here only our predictions about
drug efficacy. Predictions about drug toxicity will be discussed elsewhere.
The full PK/PD models were simulated in conjunction with the MCS
human model under various therapy regimens. A treatment period of 90 d
was simulated, but simulations were carried out for a total period of 120 d
to allow confirmation of response 4 wk after the end of treatment.

Results and Discussion
Experimental results. Personalized PD variables of the cytotoxic
drugs docetaxel, doxorubicin, gemcitabine, and CPT-11 were
estimated using the chemosensitivity tests of the patient’s tumor
cells to the respective drugs. In addition to assessing the sensitivity
to a single compound, docetaxel/gemcitabine combination was also
tested (Table 1). This combination (docetaxel, 260 Ag/mL; gemcitabine, 37.5 Ag/mL) was found in vitro to be less efficacious than
gemcitabine alone (70% versus 14% surviving cells, respectively).
Moreover, after 1:2 dilution, the docetaxel/gemcitabine combination
became completely inactive (100% surviving cells).
The xenografted animals were treated by five different drug
schedules (regimens 1–5; Table 2). Tumor sizes of the treated and
control animals were measured and registered at treatment onset
(day 0) and on day 22. The calculation of TGIT was performed
according to Eq. B. In our experiments, the TGIT values for the five

www.aacrjournals.org

regimens ranged from 38.9% (sorafenib monotherapy, regimen 4) to
109.3% (bevacizumab/docetaxel/gemcitabine, regimen 2).
Validating the predictions of the mathematical model. The
mathematical model successfully retrieved the growth curves of the
untreated MCS xenografts, including the calculated 3-month lag
period between implantation and growth (Fig. 1). Validated for
untreated tumor dynamics, the model was then simulated under
different treatment regimens. The values of TGIT were calculated
from the predicted tumor sizes (Eq. B). Model predictions were
compared with the experimentally observed values. In the initial
assessment, the average prediction accuracy was 81.9% (25). Having
refined the drug models, the accuracy of model predictions
increased to 87.1% (Table 2). The analysis below refers to the
results obtained using the refined models.
The predicted efficacy ranking of the different treatment
regimens was correct, except for the swapping of rank 3 and 4

(regimens 3 and 1). Note the small difference in the experimental
TGI values of these two regimens—59.4% for regimen 1 and 56.4%
for regimen 3. This may suggest that the difference between these
two schedules is not significant.
The most accurate prediction was achieved in the bevacizumab/
CPT-11 combination (regimen 1). The model-predicted and
measured TGIT values were 57.2% and 59.4%, respectively (accuracy
of 96.2%). The two most efficacious regimens, in terms of TGI, were
regimen 2 (bevacizumab/gemcitabine/docetaxel) with measured
TGIT being 109.3% and regimen 5 (bevacizumab/sorafenib) with
measured TGIT being 87.22%. Our prediction for regimen 2 (TGIT =
76.6% predicted versus 109.3% measured) was the less accurate of all
the predictions (accuracy of 70.1%). Nevertheless, it was correctly
identified as the most potent schedule. Note that excluding this
lowest accuracy value results in mean accuracy of 90.5%.
Antagonism between gemcitabine and docetaxel was experimentally observed in vitro using the patient’s tumor cells (Table 1).
This result is corroborated by our model simulations, which
suggest that removing gemcitabine from regimen 2 (bevacizumab/
gemcitabine/docetaxel) yields a slightly larger TGIT: 78.6% versus
76.6%. However, whereas the in vitro result is probably related to
the drug sequencing effects on cell kinetics, we believe that the
in silico predicted antagonism better reflects the in vivo setting,
where the added, relatively large, cytotoxic effect of the two drugs
may generate intensive angiogenesis, eventually leading to
excessive tumor recovery.
Proposing an improved treatment for the MCS patient. Drug
efficacy experiments in the personalized xenograft model alone are
of limited use as a theranostic tool (see above). Having validated our
mathematical model, we could use it, jointly with the results of the
empirical xenograft experiments, for analyzing putative treatment
alternatives for the patient so as to maximize the TGI (Eq. B).
Many clinical trials have been reported comparing q7d with q21d
docetaxel regimens for various indications. Nevertheless, no
definitive conclusion about the superiority of either dosing interval
can be made. In addition, several toxic effects have been associated
with weekly regimens (47). Because our preliminary simulations
pinpoint the bevacizumab/docetaxel combination as superior to
most other therapies in suppressing the growth of the MCS
patient’s xenografts (25), we wished to test whether the patient
would benefit from weekly docetaxel administrations. To this end,
a series of bevacizumab/docetaxel regimens was simulated
(regimens 6–21; Table 3). In all the studied regimens, delivery of
triweekly i.v. doses of 15 mg/kg bevacizumab combined with four
alternative docetaxel doses (45, 60, 75, and 90 mg/m2) in four
different dosing intervals (q7d, q14d, q21d, and q28d) was
simulated. The associated treatment efficacy, in terms of time to
progression and final tumor sizes, was predicted; time to
progression is defined as the time needed for 20% increase in
tumor size. Results are summarized in Table 3 and in Fig. 2A,
where the predicted tumor growth curves of the 16 simulated
treatments are shown. Our simulations suggested that once-weekly
regimens (Fig. 2A, filled circles) would be superior to other
simulated regimens for the MCS patient, both in terms of final
tumor size and time to progression. The improvement in tumor
dynamics that is predicted for once-weekly regimens is caused by
the interdosing interval and not by increasing the total drug dose:
dividing the total docetaxel dose from regimen 16 to once-weekly
dosing interval [i.e., doses of 25 mg/m2 (regimen 22)] results only in
a minute decrease in the predicted efficiency compared with
regimen 7 (75 mg/m2 q7d). Both these weekly regimens are

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (21). November 1, 2008

predicted to be more efficacious than the triweekly regimen 16
(Fig. 2). This result supports theory, suggesting that interdosing
intervals per se significantly affect drug efficacy (7, 8).
Effect of angiogenesis on treatment outcome. To understand
the mechanism underlying the predicted q7d versus q21d
superiority, we artificially changed various model variables and
examined their effects on docetaxel efficacy. By altering the kinetic
rate of new vessel formation, as influenced by VEGF secretion,
density of VEGF receptors, etc., we could test the effect of
angiogenesis on docetaxel effect over time. Our mathematical
model simulations show that a single administration of the
cytotoxic docetaxel perturbs the dynamic equilibrium between
the living tumor cells and the blood vessels that support them, thus
triggering a cascade of tumor recovery events. The more intensive
the angiogenesis, the faster the tumor recovery is (Fig. 3A and B).
Comparing the simulated tumor size in the MCS patient, after a
single docetaxel dosing, with the predicted tumor size with no
treatment, we calculated the expected TGIL at each time point
according to Eq. G. The calculated TGIL on day 7 was 46%. On day
21, the effect almost disappears, as shown by a TGIL value of only
10%—decrease of 36% (Fig. 3A). When the rate of new vessel
formation is halved, the predicted reduction in TGIL values from

q28d; A) and docetaxel [i.v. infusion applied in three different schedules:
75 mg/m2 q21d (regimen 16), 45 mg/m2 q7d (regimen 7), and 25 mg/m2 q7d
(regimen 22)]. The simulated treatment period is 90 d.

Weekly Docetaxel

Figure 3. Model simulations of MCS dynamics in the patient after a single
docetaxel dosing (75 mg/m2, 1-h i.v. infusion). A, estimated TGIL after a single
docetaxel dosing for tumors with different levels of angiogenesis intensity.
Angiogenesis intensity is determined by scaling the model variable, which
combines VEGF secretion and activity rates. Simulations using two arbitrary
scaling factors (SF ) are compared with those with estimated angiogenesis
intensity of the MCS patient and, in combination with bevacizumab (BEV ;
15 mg/kg i.v.), are presented. B, predicted decrease in TGIL from day 7 to day 21
following docetaxel administration as a function of angiogenesis intensity.

day 7 to day 21 is only 29% (39% and 10%, respectively), indicating
slower recovery from drug-induced tumor inhibition. In contrast, if
the rate of new vessel formation is doubled, compared with that
calculated for the real MCS patient, the difference in the extent of
tumor inhibition by docetaxel dose, between day 7 and day 21,
increases to 92%: 69% at day 7 versus a negative value of 22% in
day 21. The negative TGIL value means that at this point, the
number of living tumor cells is larger than it would have been if no
treatment were administered. The dependence of tumor recovery

rate on the rate of new vessel formation is almost monotonic over a
wide range of kinetic rates (Fig. 3B ). This suggests that
angiogenesis-intensive tumors can be controlled by more frequent
docetaxel dosing, whereas angiogenesis-poor tumors may be
treated by less dense regimens. Adding to docetaxel, the antiVEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab is shown in our
simulations to slow down tumor recovery. The result is a predicted
TGIL value of 76% at day 7 compared with 45% without
bevacizumab. As time goes on, bevacizumab is eliminated, which
allows rapid tumor recovery resulting in 10% TGIL on day 21
(a difference of 66%).
This work does not address drug-induced hematopoietic toxicity
(48), which is the major dose-limiting factor in radiotherapy and
chemotherapy of cancer (49). However, in another work, the
superiority of calculated 10-day interdosing docetaxel intervals for
alleviating neutropenia was theoretically shown, supporting the
superiority of the weekly docetaxel regimens.6 A clinical decision
was made to proceed with docetaxel therapy in addition to
antiangiogenesis treatment with bevacizumab. For fear of aggravating the severe pancytopenia with larger q21d doses of docetaxel,
a weekly schedule, as predicted here, was administered to the
patient. The patient had a dramatic response to therapy with a
marked decrease in serum alkaline phosphatase from bone and an
immediate substantial recovery of all three blood elements
(hemoglobin, WBCs, and platelet count). Soft tissue disease in
the lungs and liver remained stable and the patient enjoyed a
6-month period of good quality of life, ending only after pulmonary
progression of his disease to which he finally succumbed. Thus, a
combined experimental and modeling approach for treatment
personalization benefited this MCS patient.
Taken together, our results suggest that a methodology
combining xenografted biopsies and mathematical modeling has
promising prospects in personalized oncology. As our model had
predicted, the patient showed a markedly improved clinical course
after weekly docetaxel and bevacizumab combination. Our
prediction, about the superiority of once-weekly docetaxel in
patients with intensive angiogenesis, may explain observed
variability in the relative efficacy of q7d versus q21d docetaxel
regimens in cancer patients (47). This prediction should be
validated in the preclinical and clinical setting. On further
validation, it may aid physicians in identifying improved treatment
schedules for individual patients.
