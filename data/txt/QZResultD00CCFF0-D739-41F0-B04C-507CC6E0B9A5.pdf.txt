ABSTRACT
Cisplatin is a well-known chemotherapeutic agent, it could cause DNA damage and
induce apoptotic cell death, but the cisplatin resistance also appears, it’s important
to reveal the mechanisms of cisplatin resistance [1]. URGCP/URG4 is overexpressed
in various tumors and plays critical role during tumor development. We found
URGCP/URG4 was upregulated in bladder cancer cells and tissues, URGCP/URG4
overexpression increased the resistance to cisplatin-induced apoptosis in bladder
cancer, and promoted anti-apoptotic genes expression, such as Bcl-2, Survivin, MCL-1,
FLIP, and downregulated Caspase-3 expression, Knockdown of URGCP/URG4
decreased the resistance to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, and inhibited anti-apoptotic
genes expression, such as Bcl-2, Survivin, MCL-1, FLIP, and upregulated Caspase-3
expression. Mechanism analysis found URGCP/URG4 activated NF-κB pathway which is
a well-known anti-apoptotic pathway and promoted the expression of NF-κB targeted
genes. So we speculated URGCP/URG4 regulates cisplatin-induced apoptosis by
activating NF-κB pathway. We also analyzed the correlation between URGCP/URG4
expression and clinical clinicopathologic, and found its expression was positively
correlated with bladder cancer progression, it can serve as a valuable prognostic factor.
In summary, URGCP/URG4 promotes the resistance to cisplatin-induced apoptosis by
activating NF-κB pathway, and is an unfavorable prognostic factor for bladder cancer.

both carcinogenesis and cancer treatment, the mechanism
of anti-apoptotic effect in tumors is being paid more
attentions recently.
Upregulator of cell proliferation (URGCP), also
known as upregulated gene-4 (URGCP/URG4), is a
novel gene which is located on 7 chromosome (7p13). In
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), URGCP/URG4 may be
considered as a natural effector of hepatitis Bx antigen
(HBxAg) which contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis,
URGCP/URG4 is up-regulated in the presence of HBxAg.
Overexpression of URGCP/URG4 not only promotes the
growth and survival of HCC in vitro, but also accelerates
the development of HCC in vivo [5]. URGCP/URG4 is
upregulated in human gastric cancer tissues and cell

INTRODUCTION
Bladder cancer, one of the most common cancer
types in the urinary system arising from mucous membrane
of urinary bladder, accounts for 3% of all malignant
tumors all around the world and over 350,000 people are
diagnosed each year [2]. It is the 7th most common cancer
in men and the 17th most common cancer in women in
the world [3]. Like other tumors, bladder cancer cells
often have faulty apoptotic pathways, performing an
anti-apoptotic effect which leads to the resistance to the
apoptosis-inducing cancer treatment, such as radiation
or chemotherapy [4]. Consistent with accumulating
studies show that apoptosis plays an important role in

lines, and overexpression of URGCP/URG4 promotes
gastric cancer cells proliferation and tumorigenicity [6].
Moreover, URGCP/URG4 can function as a protooncogene and is associated with tumor metastasis and
recurrence in osteosarcoma [7]. These studies suggest
that URGCP/URG4 promotes the progression and
development of various tumors. However, the role of
URGCP/URG4 in bladder cancer has not been elucidated.
Here, we first determined URGCP/URG4 expression
in bladder cancer cells and tissues, then we studied the
effect of URGCP/URG4 on anti-apoptotic effect by
modulating its expression both in vitro and in vivo. We
also studied the mechanism of its anti-apoptotic effect
in bladder cancer. Finally, we analyzed the relationship
between URGCP/URG4 expression and clinicopathplogic
characteristics to examine whether URGCP/URG4 could
serve as an unfavorable prognostic factors.

To construct the overexpression plasmid, The
CDS sequence of URGCP/URG4 was PCR amplified
from cDNA of primary-cultured normal bladder
epithelial cells, and cloned into the pMSCV-retropuro vector (Clontech). The following primers were
used: forward primer: 5′-CCAGATCTACCATGG
CGTCGCCCGGGCATTC-3′ and reverse primer:
5′-GCCGAATTCTCACAGCCGTCTCACCAGCT-3′.
To knock-down URGCP/URG4, a human siRNA
sequence was cloned into the pSUPER. retro. puro
plasmid (OligoEngine) to generate pSUPER. retro.
URGCP/URG4-RNAi, the siRNA sequence was:
ACCAAAGACTTGCCCTGGAATT,
which
was
synthesized by Invitrogen. Retroviral production and
infection were performed as described previously [8].
Stable cell lines expressing URGCP/URG4 or silencing
URGCP/URG4 were selected using puromycin.
The URGCP/URG4 expression was confirmed by
immunoblotting.

The human bladder tumor cell line 5637 (from an
epithelial grade II carcinoma) and the human bladder tumor
cell line RT4 (from a transitional cell papilloma) were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(Rockville, MD). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640
medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine
(Gibco), 100 μM nonessential amino acids (NEAA), 50U/
mol penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin. The primarycultured normal bladder epithelial cells were used as the
normal control (represented as NC), which were cultured
in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 5 ng/mL
epithelial growth factor, 70 ng/mL phosphoethanolamine,
and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cisplatin (Sigma, Saint
Louis, MO, USA) was used to treat bladder cancer cells at
concentration of 40 μg/ml, for 24 h.

Cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed three
times in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended
in 0.5 ml PBS. Propidium iodide (PI) and a fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated monoclonal antibody
specific for Annexin V (Sigma) were incubated with the
cells at 4°C for 30 min. Cell apoptosis was measured using
flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson Biosciences, San Jose,
CA) and the data were analyzed by ModFit LT software
package. The experiment was performed for independently
three times for each cell line.

Mouse model
5-week-old BALB/c nude mice were used for the
bladder cancer cell lines RT4 xenograft model. Medium
(0.2 ml) containing 5 × 106 RT4 was injected subcutaneously
into the left and right posterior flank regions of each
mouse. Mice were housed in a pathogen-free environment
and tumor growth was examined every three days. After
the tumor growing for 20 days, animals were assigned to
i.p. injection of cisplatin (20mg/kg), on following days
24, 28, 32, 36, and 40. Animals were euthanized and
tumors were excised, weighed, and subjected to pathologic
examination. All animal experiments were performed
in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals and conformed by Tongji Medical
College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology
ethical guidelines for animal experiments.

3 × 104 cells per well were seeded in triplicates in
24-well plates and were allowed to settle. One hundred
nanograms of pNF-κB-luciferase plasmid or controlluciferase plasmid plus 10 ng pRL-TK renilla plasmid
(Promega) were transfected into bladder cancer cells using
the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
Luciferase and renilla signals were measured 48 hours
after transfection using the Dual Luciferase Reporter

Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were carried out using
the SPSS version 13.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, IL,
USA). The Chi-Square test was used to assess the
correlation between URGCP/URG4 expression and
clinicopathological characteristics. Bivariate correlations
between the study variables were examined using
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients. Relative risks
of death associated with URGCP/URG4 expression
and other predictive variables were estimated through
univariate and multivariate Cox-regression analysis.

RESULTS

with URGCP/URG4 shRNA and could be rescued by
URGCP/URG4 overexpression (Supplemental Figure 1).
Both the TUNEL and Annexin-V binding assays found
URGCP/URG4 silencing cell lines had less resistance to
cisplatin-induced apoptosis, and the number of apoptotic
cells was significantly higher than that in empty vector
control cells (Figure 3B and 3C). Taken together, our
results suggested that knockdown of URGCP/URG4
impaired the ability of bladder cancer cells to resist cell
death induced by cisplatin.

URGCP/URG4 is upregulated in bladder cancer
cells and tissues
To determine URGCP/URG4 expression in bladder
cancer cells and tissues, qRT-PCR and western blotting
assay showed that both mRNA and protein expression
of URGCP/URG4 were significantly upregulated in
bladder cancer cells, compared to that of in the primarycultured normal bladder epithelial cells (indicated as NC)
(Figure 1A and 1B). Meanwhile, we used eight fresh
bladder cancer tissues and one normal bladder tissue
to investigate URGCP/URG4 expression, and found
URGCP/URG4 expression was upregulated in most of
bladder cancer tissues (indicated as T) compared to that
of in normal tissue (indicated as N) (Figure 1C and 1D).
These suggested that URGCP/URG4 is upregulated in
bladder cancer, indicating a putative correlation with
bladder cancer progression.

URGCP/URG4 inhibits cisplatin-induced
apoptosis of bladder cancer cells in vivo
To further assess the effect of URGCP/URG4 on
resistance to cisplatin-induced apoptosis, we determined
its function in vivo by inoculating nude mice with tumor
cells. After treated with cisplatin, the volume and weight
of URGCP/URG4-overexpressing tumors were markedly
higher compared to the tumors formed by control cells,
indicating the anti-apoptosis function of URGCP/URG4
on bladder cancer cells in vivo (Figure 4A–4C). We
also used the stable URGCP/URG4-silencing cells to
confirm the function in vivo. Consistently, inhibition of
URGCP/URG4 enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis of
bladder cancer cells, for which tumor sizes were much
smaller (Figure 4A–4C). To investigate apoptosis of
tumor xenografts, TUNEL assay was used. Tumors from
URGCP/URG4-overexpressing xenografts displayed
fewer apoptotic cells, while tumors from URGCP/URG4silencing xenografts showed more apoptotic cells, than
that in the control groups (Figure 4D). Taken together,
these results demonstrated that URGCP/URG4 inhibits
cisplatin-induced apoptosis of bladder cancer cells
in vivo.

Ectopic URGCP/URG4 inhibits cisplatininduced apoptosis of bladder cancer cells
To explore whether upregulation of URGCP/URG4
promotes the resistance chemotherapeutics-induced
apoptosis of bladder cancer, RT4 and 5637 cells stably
overexpressing URGCP/URG4 were established for
further study. The ectopic expression of URGCP/URG4
in both stable cell lines was confirmed by western blotting
assay (Figure 2A). We examined the effect of URGCP/
URG4 on chemotherapeutics-induced cell apoptosis, by
exposing these cells to anti-tumor agent cisplatin. Cisplatin
is a well-known and popularity chemotherapeutic drug, it
kill cancer cells by causing DNA damage and initiating
apoptosis [1].
TUNEL assay found the apoptosis cells were
significantly fewer in indicated URGCP/URG4overexpressing cells (Figure 2B). Annexin-V binding
assays also showed the number of Annexin-V-FITCpositive cells in indicated URGCP/URG4-overexpressing
cells was decreased when cisplatin was used (Figure 2C).
All the results revealed that ectopic URGCP/URG4
inhibited cisplatin-induced apoptosis, it might play critical
role in bladder cancer progression and therapy.

URGCP/URG4 regulates the expression of
apoptosis related proteins and activates NF-κB
To investigate whether URGCP/URG4 regulates
apoptosis related proteins, we examined the expression
of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, and Caspase-3 which
are activated in the apoptotic cells when URGCP/
URG4 was overexpressed or knock-downed. The results
showed that URGCP/URG4 overexpression increased
Bcl-2 expression and decreased Caspase-3 and CleavedCaspase-3 expression (Figure 5A). When URGCP/
URG4 was knock-downed, Bcl-2 was downregulated,
Caspase-3 and Cleaved Caspase-3 were upregulated
(Figure 5B). We also determined Survival, mcl-1 and
FLIP expression, which all act as antipoptotic proteins.
We found URGCP/URG4 overexpression significantly
promoted these genes expression, knockdown of
URGCP/URG4 inhibited these genes expression
(Figure 5C). these suggested URGCP/URG4 is an antiapoptotic facilitator.

Inhibition of URGCP/URG4 enhances
cisplatin-induced apoptosis of bladder
cancer cells
To further confirm the function of URGCP/URG4 on
cisplatin-induced apoptosis, we downregulated URGCP/
URG4 expression using RNA inference. The effects
of URGCP/URG4 knockdown in indicated cells were
confirmed by western blotting assay (Figure 3A). URGCP/
URG4 was decreased in indicated cells transfected

NF-κB as an anti-apoptotic transcription factor, have
been widely studied, activation of NF-κB induces many antiapoptotic factors, such as cIAPs, FLICE, FLIP, A1/BFL1
and Bcl-XL [12, 13]. We determined the activity of NFκB using a luciferase reporter system. The results showed
ectopic URGCP/URG4 promoted NF-κB transcriptional
activity, silencing URGCP/URG4 inhibited the activity
of NF-κB transcription (Figure 5D). qRT-PCR analysis
found the expression of NF-κB-targeted genes, including
CCND1, Bcl-2, MMP9 and VEGF were upregulated once
overexpression of URGCP/URG4, whereas knockdown of
URGCP/URG4 significantly inhibited the levels of these
genes in bladder cancer cells (Figure 5E). Survival, MCL-1
and FLIP also are the targets of NF-κB pathway, we found
URGCP/URG4 enhances their expression. these suggested
URGCP/URG4 might regulate the resistance to cisplatininduced apoptosis by activating NF-κB pathway.
To investigate this speculation, we further examined
whether URGCP/URG4 could activate NF-κB. The
marker of NF-κB activation is that RelB (p65)-p52 dimers
translocate to the nucleus, so we determined the location
of p65 by modulating URGCP/URG4 expression. We
separated nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins used KeyGEN
Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Protein Extraction Kit (KeyGEN,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

China) according to the manufacture’s instruction. Western
blotting showed that p65 expression was significantly
increased in the nucleus of indicated cells after URGCP/
URG4 overexpression, nuclear matrix protein p84 was used
to indicate protein expression in the nucleus (Figure 6A).
We further confirmed this result used immunofluorescence,
when URGCP/URG4 was upregulated in indicated cells,
p65 translocated to the nucleus, it mainly expressed in
nucleus. When URGCP/URG4 was downregulated, it
mainly expressed in cytoplasmic (Figure 6B). these results
suggested URGCP/URG4 could activate NF-κB pathay.
All the results revealed that URGCP/URG4
promotes the resistance to cisplatin-induce apoptosis in
bladder cancer cells via activation of NF-κB signaling
pathway.

(Figure 7B, p < 0.001). We also found high expression
of URGCP/URG4 was significantly shorter than those
with high URGCP/URG4 expression in patients which
were classified into T1 (p  < 0.001) or T2 (p = 0.004)
(Figure 7C and 7D). these suggested high URGCP/
URG4 expression in primary bladder cancer patients
with poor survival.
In addition, we used Cox-regression analysis to
determine whether URGCP/URG4 could serve as a
useful prognostic factor. As shown in Table 4, we found
URGCP/URG4 expression was a independent prognostic
factor for bladder cancer patients. These suggested the
expression of URGCP/URG4 is correlated with the
prognosis of bladder cancer significantly.

In our study, we demonstrated that URGCP/URG4
was upregulated in bladder cancer cells and tissues.
Ectopic expression of URGCP/URG4 promoted the
resistance to cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis in bladder
cancer, while silencing expression of URGCP/URG4
enhanced the cisplatin-induced apoptosis, both in vitro and
in vivo. In addition, ectopic URGCP/URG4 promoted antiapoptotic factor expression and inhibited pro-apoptotic
factor expression. We further analysis found URGCP/
URG4 could activate NF-κB pathway whose target
genes are critical for apoptosis, these suggested URGCP/
URG4 promoted cisplatin-induced apoptosis by activating
NF-κB pathway. We also analyzed the correlation between

URGCP/URG4 expression and clinical parameters, and
found URGCP/URG4 expression was correlated with
bladder cancer progression, it was an unfavorable factor
for patient’s survival.
The chemotherapy is one of the most widely
used and effective methods for tumors treatment [14].
However, Drug resistance remains a major clinical
challenge and great obstacle for current cancer therapy
[15]. The mechanism of drug resistance in cancer
chemotherapy is complicated and unclear. The death of
tumor cells induced by chemotherapy is largely mediated
by activation of apoptosis, while inhibition of apoptosis
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

will increase tumor cells resistant to anti-tumor treatment
[16]. Multiple genes related to apoptosis resistance have
been found to contribute to drug resistance. For example,
overexpression of survivin promotes cancer cell growth
and drug resistance in multiple types of cancers [17].
Specific inhibition of the survival signaling resulted in a
significant enhancement of paclitaxel-induced apoptosis
[18]. It was reported that Bmi-1 upregulation protects
glioma cells from apoptosis induced by anticancer drugs
doxorubicin [19]. In our study, we determined that
URGCP/URG4 overexpression promoted the resistance
to cisplatin-induced bladder cancer cells apoptosis,

indicating its function and potential utilization in bladder
cancer chemotherapeutic treatment. It has found that
some molecular dysregulation has the potential to cause
apoptotic dysregulation, including activation of antiapoptotic factor, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL [20], inactivation
of pro-apoptotic effectors, such as p53 and Caspases [21],
or induction of survival signals including survivin, FLIP,
and NF-κB [22]. The genes modulating drug resistance
also regulate the apoptotic related factors. For examples,
Survivin enhances drug resistance via binding the effectors
cell death proteases Caspases and inhibiting Caspases
activity [23]. Bmi-1 is reported to promote apoptotic
resistance via activating NF-κB and inducing expression
of NF-κB-targeted genes [19]. Our study confirmed that
URGCP/URG4 overexpression enhanced anti-apoptotic
factor expression, such as Bcl-2 and FLIP, and inhibited
pro-apoptotic factor expression, such as Caspase-3. We
further analyzed the mechanism and found URGCP/
URG4 activated NF-κB pathway, it could promote p65
translocate to the nucleus, which a marker for activating
NF-κB pathway. NF-κB pathway plays an important role
in regulating cancer cells proliferation, anti-apoptosis,
invasion and metastasis and angiogenesis, through
modulating series of functional genes expression and
activity, including IL1A, CCND1, MYC, Bcl-2, MMP9
and VEGF [22, 24]. We also found URGCP/UGR4
overexpression promoted Bcl-2, CCND1, MMP9 and
VEGF expression, this further confirmed URGCP/URG4
could activated NF-κB pathway.
We also analyzed the correlation between URGCP/
URG4 expression and clinicopathologic parameters, and
found high URGCP/URG4 expression was correlated with
advanced clinicopathologic classifications (T and N), high
expression of URGCP/URG4 indicated an unfavorable
overall survival and served as a high risk marker of
bladder cancer, these suggested URGCP/URG4 is an
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

unfavorable prognostic factors. But the further mechanism
of URGCP/URG4 regulating drug resistance needed
to be investigate further. Cancer stem cell plays critical
role in drug resistance [25], whether URGCP/URG4
could regulate bladder cancer stem cell still needed to be
investigated.
In summary, we found URGCP/URG4 was high
expression in bladder cancer cells and tissues, it promoted
the resistance to cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis in bladder
cancer, mechanism analysis found it activated NF-κB
pathway to inhibit apoptosis. The correlation analysis
between URGCP/URG4 expression and clinicopathologic
parameters suggested URGCP/URG4 expression was
correlated with the progression of bladder cancer, and was
an unfavorable prognostic factor.
