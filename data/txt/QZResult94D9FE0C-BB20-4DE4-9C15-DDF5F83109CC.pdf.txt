Abstract
Tumor metabolism and bioenergetics have become important
topics for cancer research and are promising targets for
anticancer therapy. Although glucose serves as the main
source of energy, proline, an alternative substrate, is
important, especially during nutrient stress. Proline oxidase
(POX), catalyzing the first step in proline catabolism, is
induced by p53 and can regulate cell survival as well as
mediate programmed cell death. In a mouse xenograft tumor
model, we found that POX greatly reduced tumor formation by
causing G2 cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining showed decreased POX expression in tumor
tissues. Importantly, HIF-1A signaling was impaired with POX
expression due to the increased production of A-ketoglutarate, a critical substrate for prolyl hydroxylation and
degradation of HIF-1A. Combined with previous in vitro
findings and reported clinical genetic associations, these new
findings lead us to propose POX as a mitochondrial tumor
suppressor and a potential target for cancer therapy. [Cancer
Res 2009;69(16):6414–22]

Introduction
Although controversial over the years, a molecular basis for the
‘‘Warburg effect’’ is emerging from genetic and pharmacologic
studies that show that specific oncogene and tumor suppressor
mutations directly regulate glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation,
and other energy/nutrient supply processes (1–5). The combination of these mutations and the hypoxic conditions in many tumor
types is likely to control synergistically the overall metabolic state
and the fate of individual tumors. There are several mitochondrial
tumor suppressors that have been identified (5). The critical ways
they exert their antitumor effect are through hypoxia inducible
factor (HIF), a key player in tumor formation, and affects the
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Our previous and current findings
indicate proline oxidase (POX) plays a similar role and is a
mitochondrial tumor suppressor.
POX, also called proline dehydrogenase, is a mitochondrial
inner-membrane enzyme involved in the degradation of the
secondary amino acid proline. The function of this flavoenzyme

is to catalyze the rate-limiting two-electron oxidation of proline
to D1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) and the subsequent transfer
of reducing equivalents from the reduced flavin cofactor to the
mitochondrial electron transport chain (6). Together with P5C
reductase, which converts P5C back to proline, POX mediates the
proline cycle to shuttle redox equivalents between mitochondria
and cytosol. P5C is the intermediate providing a direct carbon
bridge connecting the TCA cycle through glutamate and aketoglutarate (a-KG) and to the urea cycle through ornithine (7).
Another important feature about proline is that together with
hydroxyproline, it constitutes over 25% of incorporated residues of
collagen, which is the most abundant protein in the extracellular
matrix and, in fact, in the entire human body. When degraded
during inflammation and tumor progression, collagen releases a
large quantity of proline after digestion by matrix metalloproteinases and prolidase. The contribution of these products to a variety
of cellular processes has recently been recognized (8).
Recent research has revealed the response of POX to energy and
nutrient stress. After it was found to be one of genes markedly
induced by p53 (9), its role in cell proliferation, apoptotic cell death,
particularly in cancer cells has been intensively investigated. POX
negatively regulates the growth of various types of cancer cells,
which prompted us to investigate further its potential role
in human cancer development. In this study, we used multiple
approaches to define the role of POX in tumor suppression and
characterized mediating mechanisms. In addition to inducing
apoptotic cell death, POX also caused cell cycle arrest at G2 phase.
Furthermore, we found that POX inhibited tumor formation in a
mouse xenograft model. Importantly, in human tissue samples,
POX expression levels were much lower in tumor tissues than in
their normal tissue counterparts. Finally, HIF signaling was reduced
in POX-expressing cells. These findings, combined with published
data and genetic information, suggest that POX is a mitochondrial
tumor suppressor protein.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. The DLD-1 human colon cancer cells are from America
Type Culture Collection. The generation, characterization, and maintenance
of the DLD-1 Tet-Off POX and DLD-1 Tet-Off Vector cell lines have been
previously described (10, 11). Dimethyloxalylglycine was purchased from
Frontier Scientific. Doxycycline (DOX) was purchased from Sigma.
Multiple protein sequence alignments. These sequence alignments
were done using the CLUSTALW2 program at the Multiple Sequence
Alignment Web site.4 The amino acid sequences were aligned and
compared among the species of Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus
norvegicus, Danio rerio, and Drosophila melanogaster.

Cell growth assays. The CellTiter 96 aqueous nonradioactive cell
proliferation assay (MTS assay; Promega), performed according to the
manufacturer’s protocol, was described in our previous studies (11). Each
data point was performed in triplicate, and the results were reported as
mean absorption F SE.
Western blot analysis. The methods for cell lysate preparation, protein
concentration determination, and electrophoresis have been described
previously (11). The primary antibodies used were GADD45a (Chemicon)
GADDh, GADDg, GADD34, GADD153 (Santa Cruz Co.), HIF-1a, vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), geminin, cyclin B1, p21, cdc25c, cdc2,
p-cdc2 (tyr-15), p-cdc2 (thr-161; Cell Signaling), (Calbiochem), and actin
(Sigma). The anti-POX polyclonal antibody was prepared and tested in the
laboratory. Blots were developed using the chemiluminescence procedure
(Amersham). All Western blots shown are representative of at least two
independent experiments.
Flow cytometry. The methods have been reported previously (11). DLD-1
Tet-Off POX cells were cultured in the medium with various concentrations
of DOX. Propidium iodide–stained cells were analyzed with an EPICS-XLMCL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). Each data point was
performed in triplicate, and the results were reported as the mean F SE.

Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Total RNA was
prepared from DLD-1-POX cells using Qiagen RNeasy kits (Qiagen). Reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) reactions were performed using Ready-To-Go
RT-PCR Beads (Amersham). The RT reaction was carried out using 0.5 Ag
RNA at 42jC for 30 min, followed by 5 min at 95jC to inactivate the
enzyme. Then, 2 Amol/L specific primers were added per reaction and
subjected to 23 to 28 cycles of amplification at 94jC 30 s/60jC 30 s/72jC
45 s. RT-PCR to actin was performed as control. All PCR shown are
representative of at least two independent experiments. The specific
sequences of the primers used have been reported elsewhere (12–15).
Animal studies. The animal protocol was approved by the National
Cancer Institute-Frederick Animal Care and Use committee. Sixty-two
Balb/C athymic mice were randomized to four groups. Two groups with
nine mice in each were injected with 2  106 of DLD-1 Tet-off Vector cells
fed water with or without 100 Ag/mL of DOX. The other two groups, with
22 mice in each, were given same number of DLD-1 Tet-off POX cells, also in
(+) DOX or ( ) DOX conditions. For mice that did not develop tumors in
( ) DOX group, half of them (eight mice) were switched to receive drinking
water with DOX, whereas the other half were kept in ( ) DOX. The tumor
development in these two new groups was monitored. The mice were

Figure 3. The involvement of GADD family proteins. The DLD-1 Tet-off POX cells were cultured in medium with 20 ng/mL [(+) DOX], or 100- and 1000-fold dilution
(0.2 or 0.02 ng/mL) for 1 or 3 d. The cells were harvested and RNA and cell lysates were prepared and then semiquantitative RT-PCR (A and B ) and Western blots (C )
for GADD members were performed. Actin was used as loading control.

observed for tumor development thrice a week and tumors were measured
twice a week after they developed.
Immunohistochemical staining. The immunostaining for POX was
performed by the Pathology/Histotechnology Laboratory, National Cancer
Institute-Frederick. The human tissue arrays, which contained paired
cancer/normal tissues from the same patient, were purchased from Cybridi,
Co. Two independent pathologists read and graded the expression as 5
levels: 0, +, ++, +++, and ++++. The expression of POX in tumor and
normal tissues from the same patients were then compared, and changes
(up-regulation, no change, or down-regulation) were determined. Data
were statistically analyzed using the Z test. The xenograft tumors were
collected from athymic mice and fixed in 10% formaldehyde and then
embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections were then mounted on slides and
processed for either H&E staining or immunostaining for POX, BrdUrd, or
for terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay.
Determination of the A-keto acids. a-Keto acids were determined by
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as their fluorescent
quinoxalinol derivatives as per the method of Pailla (16). Analysis was
carried out by HPLC on a C18 reverse phase column with fluorescence
detection using an excitation E of 350 nm and an emission E of 410 nm.
Concentration of the keto acids was calculated from linear calibration plots
using the internal standard method.
Determination of the organic acids: lactic acid, succinic acid, and
fumaric acid. Organic acids were determined by gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry as per the method of Hagen (17). The characteristic fragment
ions were monitored as follows; 261 m/z (lactic acid), 289 m/z (succinic
acid), 287 m/z ( fumaric acid), and 179 m/z (benzoic acid). Concentrations
of the organic acids were calculated from linear calibration plots using the
internal standard method.
Soft agar colony formation assay. DLD-1 Tet-Off POX cells were seeded
at 1  103 per well in six-well dishes with a bottom layer of 0.7% agar in
DMEM and a top layer of 0.35% agar in DMEM, whereas both layers
contained DOX in concentrations of 20, 1.0, 0.2, and 0.0 ng/mL, respectively.
Colonies (>0.2 mm in diameter) were counted after 10 to 14 d. At least two
independent assays were performed in triplicate.
Statistical analysis. Z test was used for immunohistochemical staining
data. Null hypothesis of proportion of decrease is equal to 50%. For other
data, Fisher’s exact test and Student’s t test were used.

Results
POX is highly conserved during evolution. Using ClustalW2
alignment software, we compared amino acid sequences of POX
protein from several species. We found homologues of POX in
Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Danio rerio, and
Drosophila melanogaster (Supplementary Fig. S1). This finding
indicates that this gene is highly conserved among various species
during evolution, and suggests an important role for POX in
eukaryotic cells.

POX overexpression inhibited tumor development in a
mouse xenograft model. We and others have shown that POX
inhibited cell growth in a variety of cultured cancer cells (11, 18–21).
To extend this cancer-suppressing effect to in vivo studies, we
developed a mouse xenograft model by injecting DLD-1 Tet-off
POX cells and DLD-1 Tet-off Vector cells into athymic mice. In mice
receiving vector control cells, tumors developed quickly. The
addition of DOX to the drinking water made no difference for
tumor development (Fig. 1A). For mice injected with DLD-1-POX
cells, in the (+) DOX group, as was the case with vector controls,
tumors developed quickly. By contrast, tumor development was
greatly reduced in mice in the ( ) DOX group (Fig. 1A). To extend
this experiment further, we switched half (8) of the mice in the ( )
DOX group that were tumor-free by week 5 to receive drinking
water with DOX to suppress POX expression, and then compared
the tumor development in these two new groups (phase II). Data
again showed that the ( ) DOX group had fewer mice with tumors
(Fig. 1A). The induced-expression of POX by removal of DOX in
drinking water was shown by immunostaining for POX, which was
mainly found in the cell cytoplasm consistent with its mitochondrial location (Fig. 1A).
To understand the mechanism by which POX inhibited in vivo
tumor development, we assessed proliferation and apoptosis using
the mouse tumor tissues. In TUNEL assays, consistent with in vitro
data, we found higher levels of apoptosis in ( ) DOX condition
than in (+) DOX (Fig. 1B). We also performed BrdUrd incorporation
assay to assess cell proliferation. The incorporation rate was greatly
reduced in POX cells in ( ) DOX (29.4%) compared with that in (+)
DOX (65.6%) or vector cells in either condition (Fig. 1C). Because
the apoptotic rate was low we suspected that cell cycle blockade/
inhibition of proliferation was the major reason for POX’s
inhibition of tumor development and growth.
To characterize the effects on growth further, we performed soft
agar colony formation assays. When cells were kept in (+) DOX
condition (20 ng/mL), they readily formed clones. When in ( )
DOX, the cloning ability of the cell was totally blocked. DOX at
a concentration as low as 1.0 ng/mL markedly reduced clone
formation (Fig. 1D).
POX also caused G2 cell cycle arrest to inhibit cell growth. A
tumor suppressor protein exerts its inhibitory function through
either induction of apoptosis or blockade of cell cycle, or both. The
published data from this and other laboratories clearly showed the
role of POX in the induction of apoptosis, and the mechanism and
signaling pathways involved have been suggested (11, 18–23).
However, our animal work indicated that POX might also regulate

progression of cells in the cell cycle. Because apoptosis and not cell
cycle distribution was the prominent feature of cells when POX was
highly expressed in previously published studies (11, 18–20), we
suspected that expression levels of POX might be critical for its
roles. Thus, taking advantage of the Tet expression system, which
allows the introduction of target genes dose-dependently by DOX,
we determined the effects of POX at different levels on cell growth
and the cell cycle. First, we confirmed that POX was indeed
suppressed by DOX in a dose-dependent fashion in DLD-1 Tet-off
POX cells (Fig. 2A). Then we turned on the expression of POX at
different levels by varying DOX concentrations and monitored its
effects on cell growth. Consistent with our previous data, cells grew
normally with DOX (20 ng/mL), whereas cells died when in ( )
DOX. Importantly, we found that cells neither grew nor died when
cultured in medium with reduced DOX (0.2 and 0.02 ng/mL),
suggesting a possible blockade in cell cycle (Fig. 2A).
To investigate cell cycle distribution further, we performed flow
cytometry. Based on the dose-dependent effect of DOX on POX
expression, cells were treated with DOX at 100- and 1,000-fold
dilutions of the usual concentration for the (+) DOX condition (0.2
and 0.02 ng/mL) for 3 days to induce POX expression at relatively
low levels, with cells in (+) DOX (20 ng/mL) as control. We found
that the percentages of cells in sub-G1/G0 phase were low and
increased only slightly ( from 2% to 4–6%); the significant changes
were in S phase, which decreased from 23% to 8% to 13%, and in G2
phase, which increased from 18% to 30% to 39%, indicating a G2
cell cycle arrest by POX when it was expressed at moderate levels
(Fig. 2B). Geminin is a nuclear protein that inhibits DNA
replication, and has been used as a marker for G2 phase (24). Its
expression was also up-regulated by POX in DLD-1 cells (Fig. 2C).
To investigate further the molecular regulation of G2 phase and
G2-M transition, we examined CDC2, the cyclin-dependent kinase
that normally drives cells into mitosis and is the ultimate target of
pathways that mediate rapid G2 arrest in response to DNA damage
(25). We found that although total CDC2 did not change, the
phosphorylated CDC2 at tyrosine 15 increased, whereas phosphorylation at theronine 161 decreased with POX expression (Fig. 2D).
These changes indicated that CDC2 was in an inactive status.
CDC25C, the phosphatase that removes the inhibitory phosphates
from CDC2 and activates cyclinB-CDC2, was found to be downregulated (Fig. 2D). It is likely that these changes were directly
responsible for POX-induced G2 cell cycle arrest.
GADDs may play a role in POX-induced G2 cell cycle arrest.
The finding that POX arrested cells in G2 phase prompted us to
identify pathways and genes whose expression might be responsible for this arrest, as well as for POX-induced apoptosis and other
changes. First, we turned to cDNA microarray (Affymatrix U133A
2.0), which covers 14,500 well-characterized human genes and
transcripts. We found that the expression of 814 genes had been
changed >2-fold when POX is over expressed.5 Among them, the
increased expression of the GADD (growth arrest and DNA damage
inducible gene) family was of interest, because the most important
role of this family is to cause G2 cell cycle arrest, and GADD45a, the
main member of this family, is a downstream gene of p53; it
directly interacts with p21 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen,
both important direct regulators of the cell cycle. It also plays a role
in apoptotic induction in certain situations (26). Interestingly, most

genes in this family were up-regulated with POX overexpression.
The array data revealed that GADD45a was induced by 3.2-fold,
GADDh by 6.3-fold, GADDg by 3.8-fold, and GADD34 by 4.4-fold. To
confirm this, we performed semiquantitive RT-PCR and Western
blots for these members. The POX expression of DLD-1 cells was
induced at different levels for 1 or 3 days. Elevation of GADD34,
GADD45a, GADDh, GADDg at the RNA level and GADD34,
GADD45a, and GADD153 at the protein level was observed
(Fig. 3). The detailed role of GADDs in POX’s inhibition of cell
growth is still under investigation. But, certainly, the up-regulation
of GADDs may play a role in POX-induced G2 cell cycle arrest, as
well as apoptosis.
The reduced expression of POX in human cancer tissues. To
show the role/function of a gene product in cancer development
and progression, it is important to determine its differential
expression levels in human tumors. Taking advantage of the
availability of human tissue arrays that provide a large number and
variety of cancer tissues along with normal tissue counterparts
from the same patient as control, we performed immunohistochemical staining for the expression of POX. In total, we had 92
pairs of tumor/normal tissues from kidney, bladder, stomach, colon
and rectum, liver, pancreas, breast, prostate, ovary, brain, lung, skin,
etc. Strikingly, POX levels were much lower in tumor tissues when
compared with normal tissues (Fig. 4). Statistical analysis showed
the difference significant (P < 0.05). This difference was more
significant in kidney, where all six pairs showed lower POX
expression in tumors, and digestive tract tissues, including those
from colon, rectum, stomach, liver, and pancreas (Fig. 4B). These
findings indicate that POX may be related to cancer development
and progression in humans, particularly in digestive tract tissues
and kidney.
A potential mitochondrial tumor suppressor. POX protein is
located in the mitochondrial inner membrane, and has an
anaplerotic role through glutamate and a-KG for the TCA cycle
(Fig. 5; ref. 8). Due to this special location and function, we
considered that POX may regulate HIF signaling, as has been
suggested for other mitochondrial tumor suppressors (6). Thus, we

investigated HIF signaling. We found that HIF-1a levels were
greatly reduced by POX in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions
(Fig. 6A). As expected, the expression of its downstream gene,
VEGF, was also down-regulated by POX (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, we
tried to determine the mechanism by which HIF signaling was
inhibited. As the most important oxygen sensor, the stability and
transcriptional activity of HIF-1a are regulated through posttranslational hydroxylation of specific prolyl and asparaginal residues in
its a-subunits. These oxygen-sensitive modifications are catalyzed
by members of the 2-oxoglutarate (a-ketoglutarate) dioxygenase
family (27). Recent studies have revealed that several TCA cycle
intermediates and glycolytic metabolites, including succinate and
fumarate, inhibit PHD activity and stabilize HIF signaling (27–31).
We suspected that as an important link between proline
metabolism and TCA cycle, a-KG, a substrate of PHD, might play
a critical role in the down-regulation of HIF by POX (Fig. 5).
Thus, we determined the effect of POX on the cellular levels
of a-KG by HPLC analysis and found increased levels of a-KG
with overexpression of POX (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, the levels of
several TCA cycle intermediates were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and succinate, fumarate, and lactate
all were found to be decreased with POX expression (Fig. 6C). To
directly decide whether a-KG played a role in the inhibition of
HIF signaling by POX, we used the widely used, cell-permeating
a-KG analogue dimethyloxalylglycine. The results showed that
dimethyloxalylglycine blocked the POX inhibition of HIF (Fig. 6D),
further supporting the important role of a-KG in the regulation
of HIF signaling. This finding further assures the important
connection between proline cycle and TCA cycle.
As a critical mediator of POX-mediated signaling and induction
of apoptosis, the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS)/superoxides
in HIF inhibition with POX expression was also examined. The data
showed that after the removal of DOX from the culture medium
and the induction of POX, HIF expression was decreased, but
unlike our previously reported effects of POX on other signaling
pathways, the effect on HIF-1a was not reversed by MnSOD,
suggesting ROS/superoxides were not a mediator for HIF inhibition

Figure 5. Proposed mechanisms by which POX inhibits
HIF signaling. The interconversion between proline and
P5C, catalyzed by POX and P5CR, respectively, forms the
proline cycle. When POX expression is high, P5C,
glutamate and a-KG are sequentially produced, forming an
important link between proline and the TCA cycle. As an
important substrate of prolyl hydroxylase, a-KG increases
the hydroxylation of HIF-1a, which will be degradated
through ubiquitinal and proteosomal degradation systems.
This is probably the principal mechanism by which POX
expression decreases HIF signaling. On the other hand,
the TCA cycle is affected, as shown by decreased cellular
levels of fumarate, succinate, and lactate. The decreased
levels of these TCA cycle intermediates may also
contribute to impaired HIF signaling. Thus, inhibition of HIF
could be another mechanism, along with those previously
identified, by which POX exerts its tumor-suppressing role.

Figure 6. The effect of POX on HIF signaling and TCA
cycle intermediates. A, left, the inhibition of HIF-1a and its
downstream gene VEGF was shown by Western blots in
both normoxic and hypoxic conditions (1% of O2, HIF-1*,
indicated longer film exposure). Right, the relative average
densitometric data of four Western blots to HIF-1a in

effect of ROS/superoxide on HIF signaling, MnSOD was

reverse the POX effect on the expression of HIF-1a.
C, DLD-POX cells were plated with DOX. After 18 h,
fresh medium with or without DOX was substituted for
the plating medium. Levels of a-KG were determined by

D, the effect of dimethyloxalylglycine on HIF-1a levels
was shown by Western blots. *, statistically significant
difference (P < 0.01).

(Fig. 6B). Because a-KG, a critical substrate for PHD-catalyzed
hydroxylation of HIF-1a and degradation, was markedly elevated
with POX overexpression, it seems likely that it is the mediator for
POX-dependent inhibition of HIF signaling.

Discussion
The POX gene is evolutionarily conserved with a high degree of
homology existing in drosophila, zebrafish, mouse, rat, human, etc.,
suggesting a fundamental biological role. In this present study, in
keeping with previously published data from this and other
laboratories, we established the tumor suppressor effect of POX in
cancer by showing its effects on the regulation of several important
signaling pathways: the induction of apoptosis, the blockade of the
cell cycle, and inhibition of tumor growth/development in vitro and
in vivo. Importantly, a significant number of human tumors had
reduced expression of POX. Additionally, the data revealed that
POX could be a mitochondrial tumor suppressor by affecting HIF
signaling and TCA cycle.
Tumor suppressors may lose their normal functions through
various mechanisms; this loss would facilitate malignant transformation and cell proliferation (32). We sought genetic and
epigenetic variations in the POX gene and its promoter using
human tumors and normal tissues, but no definitive changes have
been found thus far (occasional polymorphisms but no mutations
or hypermethylations). Nevertheless, the literature indicates
genetic changes in POX in several human cancers. The POX gene
is located at chromosome 22q11.2, a common breakpoint and a
region subject to translocation. Deletions at this site have been
associated with a variety of human cancers (33, 34). The linkage of
POX alterations with cancer development is also supported by the
observation that there is much higher frequency of malignancy in

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (16). August 15, 2009

patients with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge
syndrome/velocardiofacial syndrome; ref. 34). Two tumor suppressors have been identified in chromosome 22q11, hSNF5, and NF2
(35, 36). Some studies suggest the presence of another tumor
suppressor gene whose alteration is responsible for the development of several types of cancer (37–39). One genetic study
described ependymomas with 22q11 loci loss of heterozygosity, but
neither NF2 nor hSNF5 gene was involved (40, 41). Thus, the
existence of other tumor suppressor genes at this locus was
suggested. It is tempting to speculate that POX may be this
putative suppressor.
As a mediator of these cancer suppressive effects, we found a
novel POX-mediated mechanism in its down-regulation of HIF-1
signaling. In DLD-1 POX cells, overexpression of POX increased
the cellular level of a-KG, an important substrate for the
hydroxylation of HIF-1a by PHDs. As a substrate for PHD, a-KG
stimulates hydroxylation of HIF-1a, increases its binding to VHL
protein and causes its decrease via rapid ubiquitinylation and
subsequent proteasomal degradation. HIF is an antiapoptotic
factor; thus, the POX-mediated decrease in HIF signaling may
contribute to POX-induced apoptosis and inhibition of cell and
tumor growth.
We and others previously have shown the critical role of ROS/
superoxides in POX-induced apoptosis (11, 18, 19, 21). Actually, the
effects of ROS on HIF could be either positive or negative,
depending on ambient oxygen levels, etc. (27). As our data showed
that MnSOD had no effect on POX-mediated inhibition of HIF-1a
(Fig. 6D), the regulation of HIF signaling is most likely not due
directly to POX-mediated generation of superoxides. In fact, a-KG
is the likely mediator of the decrease in HIF-1a by POX, and this
decrease occurs in spite of the POX-mediated increase in ROS and
the known effect of ROS in stabilizing HIF-1a.

POX: A Novel Mitochondrial Tumor Suppressor

Thus, there are two important biochemical mechanisms related
to POX-mediated stress responses. Dysregulation or loss of these
responses contributes to tumor development and/or uncontrolled
cell growth. One is redox stress resulting from increased levels of
ROS. Another is metabolic signaling mediated by increased levels of
a-KG. Both may produce their effects through activation/inhibition
of well-recognized signaling pathways. Actually, these two functions may be linked and share a common denominator. For
example, a-KG dehydrogenase, the enzyme converting a-KG to
succinyl-CoA, is an important target of ROS, and is itself a
generator of oxidative stress (42).
Mitochondrial dysfunction has long been linked to cancer, and a
number of mechanisms have been suggested (3–5). The findings
reported here suggest possible consequences in cells with POX
dysregulation. POX may be up-regulated under stress conditions to
retard the cell cycle and augment apoptosis on the one hand, or
alternatively, to provide TCA cycle intermediates and to provide
redox coupling of the proline cycle to alternative energy pathways
(43). The loss of the cancer suppressive functions of POX decreases
POX-mediated apoptosis, removes the POX-mediated suppression
of HIF signaling, and augments the conversion to aerobic glycolysis,
features of the Warburg effect.
It may be pointed out that increased cancer risk in patients with
inherited deficiency of the POX has not been described. A possible
explanation is the redundant function of hydroxyproline oxidase in
apoptosis (44). Furthermore, patients with this rare inborn error
are usually identified in childhood, and careful follow-up into the
age range with increased cancer risk is not available.

Finally, genetic or epigenetic mechanisms for the decrease or
loss of POX deserve further study. Although well-recognized tumor
suppressors such as BRCA1/2 and APC underlie familial cancer
syndromes, with sporadic tumors, a substantial number of lowpenetrance alleles remain to be identified. Loss of these alleles in
combination may lead to malignant transformation. It is possible
that POX dysregulation, along with other carcinogenic factors, can
stimulate uncontrolled cell growth and eventually tumor formation. Thus, POX as a target for cancer therapeutics, in combinational metabolic interventions in particular, remains an attractive
possibility.
