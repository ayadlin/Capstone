ABSTRACT
Reelin is an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein that is essential for neuron
migration and positioning. The expression of reelin in multiple myeloma (MM) cells
and its association with cell adhesion and survival were investigated. Overexpression,
siRNA knockdown, and the addition of recombinant protein of reelin were used to
examine the function of reelin in MM cells. Clinically, high expression of reelin was
negatively associated with progression-free survival and overall survival. Functionally,
reelin promoted the adhesion of MM cells to fibronectin via activation of a5β1 integrin.
The resulting phosphorylation of Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) led to the activation
of Src/Syk/STAT3 and Akt, crucial signaling molecules involved in enhancing cell
adhesion and protecting cells from drug-induced cell apoptosis. These findings indicate
reelin’s important role in the activation of integrin-β1 and STAT3/Akt pathways in
multiple myeloma and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting reelin/integrin/
FAK axis.

[3-13]. Thus, the modulation of MM cell adhesion via
blocking of integrin β1 resulted in beneficial therapeutic
effects when combined with chemotherapy [6, 14-15].
The ECM protein reelin has been found in the brain
[16-20] and several types of peripheral tissues and cells
[21-23]. Certain types of tumor also up-regulate reelin
expression, including high Gleason score prostate cancer,
esophageal carcinoma, and retinoblastoma [24-27].
Extensive studies have shown that reelin plays an essential
role in regulating the correct migration and positioning of
cortical neurons and spines [16-20]. However, how reelin
affects the adhesion, migration, and survival of tumor cells
remains unclear. To understand the contribution of reelin
to cancer pathology, we investigated its expression and
function in MM cells.

INTRODUCTION
The strong and complex interactions between
multiple myeloma (MM) cells and the microenvironment
of the bone marrow (BM) lead to tumor cell survival,
proliferation, invasion, and the development of acquired
drug resistance [1-2]. For example, the activation
of integrin β1 promotes MM cell adhesion to BM
extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, including laminin,
microfibrillar collagen type VI, and fibronectin (FN).
Such adhesion could induce upregulation of antiapoptotic
bcl-2 family members and/or overexpression of multidrug
resistant gene 1, thereby causing malignant cells to become
unresponsive to anticancer drugs, a phenomenon called
“cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance” (CAM-DR)

RESULTS

30 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 23.7, 37.3)
and 19 months (95% CI: 12.3, 25.0), respectively (P =
0.022). The OS for low and high RELN groups were 34
months (95% CI: 27.6, 39.6) and 21 months (95% CI:
15.3, 27.6), respectively (P = 0.014). In addition, high
RELN expression was associated with higher numbers of
tumor cells in the bone marrow (42.0% ± 24.9% for high
RELN and 28.5% ± 22.8% for low RELN expressions, P
= 0.029). No significant association was found between
RELN expression and extramedullary disease (EMD),
with 11% EMD in the low RELN group and 23% in the
high RELN group, P = 0.205. These results suggest that
reelin may facilitate MM progression in the BM.

High RELN expression negatively correlates
with progression-free survival and overall
survival in MM patients
To determine the expression of RELN in multiple
myeloma, CD138+ cells from the BM aspirates of 3
healthy donors and 70 newly diagnosed or relapsed MM
patients were purified and subjected to RNA extraction
and quantitative RT-PCR (Figure 1A and Supplemental
Figure 1A). RELN expression in one of the MM cell
lines, H929, was used as an internal control and GAPDH
was used as a housekeeping gene control. The CD138+
cells from healthy donors exhibited very low level
of RELN expression (Figure 1B). In patients, various
amounts of RELN was found in CD138+ myeloma cells
and a hierarchical cluster analysis with Ward’s method
was used to analyze the relative expression fold of RELN
(compared with the GAPDH control). An arbitrary cutoff value was then set at 40-relative expression fold to
separate low from high RELN expression. The group
with low RELN expression had better progression-free
survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) than that with
high RELN expression (Figure 1C-1D). The Median
PFS for low and high RELN expression groups were

Reelin promotes MM cell adhesion to ECM
To examine the role of reelin in MM pathology,
three human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs) were used:
H929, RPMI8226, and U266. Among these cell lines,
H929 displayed the highest, whereas RPMI8226 displayed
the lowest, levels of reelin mRNA and protein (Figure 2A2B, Supplemental Figure 1B). As shown in Figure 2B,
two reelin immunoreactive bands (full length isoform of
388 KDa and a cleaved fragment of 140 KDa [28]) were
revealed with the 388 KDa as the major form of reelin
protein in HMCL lysates.

PCR was performed to measure the level of RELN transcription. The quantification was based on ∆∆CT calculations and was normalized

As reelin plays an important role in regulating the
positioning of neurons, we first investigated whether
suppressing intrinsic reelin activity by the addition of a
function-blocking anti-reelin antibody (CR-50 [29]) could
alter MM cell adhesion to FN. Both adherent cell counting
and colorimetric analysis were used to measure cell
adhesion. As shown in Figure 2C-2E, CR-50 suppressed the
cell adhesion in reelinhi/int H929 and U266 cells but not in
reelinlo RPMI8226 cells (the control antibody did not show
suppression). To examine whether the adhesion of reelinlo
RPMI8226 cells could be improved by reelin, the cells
were pre-incubated with recombinant reelin (rReelin) in the
presence or absence of CR-50 for an hour. The cells were
then thoroughly washed and were tested for their adhesion
in FN-coated plates. Reelinint/hi U266 and H929 cells were
also included in the experiments. Significantly enhanced cell
adhesion was found in all three rReelin-treated HMCLs and
was abolished in CR-50-treated ones (Figure 2F-2H). These
indicate that reelin can promote MM adhesion to FN.
The involvement of reelin in MM adhesion was
further examined by RELN overexpression using the pCrl
plasmid (Supplemental Figure 1C-1F) and by knockdown
of intrinsic expression using reelin-specific siRNAs
(Supplemental Figure 1G-1I). In pCrl-transfected HMCLs, a
significant increase in adhesion to FN was observed (Figure
2I-2L for H929 cells and Supplemental Figure 1J for U266
cells). The addition of CR-50 suppressed the adhesion
(Figure 2L). In siRNA-transfected H929 cells, however, a
significant reduction of adhesion was found and the addition
of recombinant reelin protein partially alleviated the
inhibition of adhesion (Figure 2I-2K, 2M). When mutations
around the siRNA cleavage site were introduced into reelinspecific siRNA (m-siRNA1, Supplemental Figure 1I), the
knockdown of reelin expression and the reduction of cell
adhesion to FN were both abolished (Figure 2M).
In addition, the adhesion-promoting effect of reelin
was completely nullified when Brefelin A was used to
block protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum
to Golgi complex (Figure 2N), suggesting that cell-FN
adhesion promoted by reelin requires reelin to be released
to the extracellular space. We further examined whether
the adhesion enhanced by reelin is FN-specific and found
that MM cell adhesion to poly-L-lysine (PLL)-coated wells
was not increased by the addition of rReelin (Supplemental
Figure 1K). No direct adhesion of HMCLs to rReelin was
observed, even though reelin itself is an ECM protein
(Supplemental Figure 1L). Taken together, these results
indicate that reelin expressed and secreted by MM cells
specifically promotes MM cell adhesion to FN, probably via
the alteration of FN receptors expressed on the cell surface.

were treated with Doxorubicin (Dox) in the presence and
absence of FN. As shown in Figure 3A and Supplemental
2A-2B, the overexpression of reelin significantly protected
H929 from Dox-induced cell apoptosis (IC50 for reelin
overexpression and control samples were 1.6 and 1.1 μM,
respectively, Supplemental Figure 2B). The presence of
FN further enhanced the protective effect of reelin (IC50
for reelin overexpression and control were 4.1 and 3.4
μM, respectively, Supplemental Figure 2B). In contrast,
suppressing the intrinsic expression of reelin using
specific siRNAs induced more MM cell apoptosis upon
Dox treatment, whereas the addition of recombinant reelin
alleviated the siRNA’s inhibitory effect on Dox-treated
MM cells (Figure 3A-3B, Supplemental Figure 2A).
Similarly, reelin overexpression protected HMCLs from
cisplatin (DDP, Supplemental Figure 2C)- and imatinib
mesylate (IM, Supplemental Figure 2D)-induced apoptosis
in FN-coated plates. IC50 for reelin overexpression and
control samples were 40 and 50 μM for DDP, 34 and 40
μM for IM, respectively. In the absence of these agents,
reelin overexpression or silencing did not significantly
affect H929 cell survival (Figure 3A). These results
suggest that reelin promotes MM cell survival.
To examine whether reelin promotes the survival
of Dox-treated MM cells via alteration of the balance
between pro- and anti-apoptotic gene expressions, RELNoverexpressing H929 cells were treated with Dox in the
presence and absence of FN for 24 hours before being
harvested for quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Compared with
the vector control, pCrl-transfected cells had significantly
higher expression levels of anti-apoptotic genes such as
BCL2, MCL1, and BIRC5 (survivin) in the presence or even
in the absence of FN, thus tilting the balance of reelinhi MM
cells toward cell survival (Figure 3C).

Reelin promotes the activation of integrin β1
We next investigated the cell surface molecules
that might be involved in reelin-promoted MM cell
adhesion. The very low density lipoprotein receptor
(VLDLR) and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) are
well-studied high affinity receptors for reelin [30-31].
The binding of these two receptors with reelin results
in their interaction with the adaptor protein, Disabled 1
(Dab1), and subsequent phosphorylation of Dab1 by Src
family tyrosine kinases (SFKs) [32]. The transmembrane
proteins Ephrin B and EphB were reported recently
to bind to reelin and subsequently activate the EphB
forward signaling [33] or promote the phosphorylation
of Dab1  [34]. Thus, the mRNA expressions of these
molecules were examined in all three HMCLs. The breast
cancer cell line MCF7 and human embryonic kidney 293T
cells were used as controls. As shown in Figure 4A, all
the HMCLs expressed ApoER2, but very little VLDLR.
Ephrin B2 was expressed by all three HMCLs while
EphB2 was only expressed in RPMI8226 cells. However,
the expression of Dab1 was not detected, even using

nested PCR (Figure 4A), suggesting that the activation of
Dab1 and its downstream signaling pathway may not be
involved in MM cell adhesion promoted by reelin.
We then examined whether the expression and
activation of integrin was altered following RELN changes.
Integrin α3β1 binds directly with reelin, although its effect
on neuronal migration or neuron-ECM adhesion remains
controversial [18, 35-37]. Reelin can also bind to integrin
α5β1, albeit with lower affinity when compared with
ApoER2 [38]. As shown in Figure 4B-4C, all three HMCLs
expressed α5β1, whereas only RPMI8226 expressed both
α3β1 and α5β1. Slightly increased expressions of α5 and β1
mRNAs (Supplemental Figure 3A-3B) and proteins (CD29,
Figure 4D-4E) were found in H929 cells after their adhesion
to FN or transfection with reelin-expressing plasmid (pCrl).
In contrast, reduced mRNA levels of α5 and β1, as well
as the protein level of β1 (Figure 4D-4E, Supplemental
Figure 3C) were observed in H929 cells transfected with
RELN-specific siRNAs. Reelin not only increases integrin
β1 expression, but also activates it. A reduction in the
activated form of β1 (HUTS-21) was observed in H929,
U266, and RPMI8226 cells receiving RELN-specific
siRNAs, whereas an increase in activated β1 was shown
in cells receiving pCrl plasmid or rReelin protein (Figure
4F-4G and Supplemental Figure 3D-3F). The addition of
CR-50 blocked β1 activation by rReelin (Figure 4F-4G). In
addition, Brefeldin A, which blocks the secretion of reelin,
also diminished the activation of integrin β1 (HUTS-21)
induced by RELN overexpression, suggesting that reelin is
required to be released from the cells to promote integrin β1
activation (Supplemental Figure 3G).
To test directly whether reelin-induced MM cell
adhesion to FN was mediated by β1 integrin, MM cells
were treated with the β1 inhibitory antibody P4C10 and
rReelin for 1 hour. Similar to the effect of reelin-blocking
antibody CR-50, P4C10 also abolished reelin’s capability
of promoting MM adhesion to FN (Figure 4H). These data
suggest that reelin likely enhances the binding capacity of
the extracellular domain of integrin α5β1 to their ligands
in ECM (integrin activation), thereby promoting MM cell
adhesion.

Western blotting also showed that pCrl-transfected MM
cells had significantly more phosphorylation of FAK at
both Tyr397 and Tyr861 than control vector-transfected
ones in the presence of FN (Figure 5B). A slightly more
FAK phosphorylation at Tyr861 was also found in H929
cells transfected with pCrl in the absence of FN (BSA
group) (Figure 5B). The total amount of FAK did not
appear to change. A comparison of Src phosphorylation
between pCrl- and control vector-transfected H929 cells
also revealed that the phosphorylation of Src was slightly
enhanced in reelin-overexpressing cells in the absence of
FN and was further enhanced in the presence of FN. As
FAK/Src has been shown to activate phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt to promote cell adhesion and
survival [40-41], the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473
was examined. H929 cells transfected with pCrl in FNcoated wells showed a slight but significant increase in Akt
phosphorylation when compared to controls (Figure 5B5C). The second pathway activated by FAK/Src, the ERK
pathway, was also examined. No differences of ERK1/2
phosphorylation were found between pCrl- and control
vector-transfected cells (Figure 5B). Similar results were
also found in U266 cells (Supplemental Figure 4B). These
data indicate that the activation of integrin β1 by reelin
results in the phosphorylation of the FAK/Src/Akt pathway.
To determine if reelin-induced refractoriness of MM
cells to Dox is associated with reelin’s activation of FAK/
Src/Akt pathway, H929 cells transfected with pCrl or reelinspecific siRNAs were treated with 2 μmol/L Dox in the
presence or absence of FN. Twenty-four hours later, the cells
were harvested and subjected to western blotting. Compared
with their respective controls, more phosphorylation of FAK
and Akt was found in pCrl-transfected cells, whereas less
activation of these signaling molecules was found in reelinspecific siRNA-transfected ones (Figure 5D-5E). Again, the
phosphorylation of ERK was not affected by altering reelin
expression levels in H929 cells. Notably, the differences in
FAK and Akt activation were also seen in H929 cells in the
absence of FN, implying that the activation of FAK/Src/
Akt pathway by reelin may not completely require activated
integrin β1 to bind with FN.

Phosphorylation of FAK, Src, and Akt
contributes to reelin/β1-induced cell adhesion

Phosphorylation of Syk and STAT3 contributes
to reelin/β1-induced cell adhesion and CAM-DR

To examine if reelin activates the integrin β1
signaling pathway, the phosphorylation of focal adhesion
kinase (FAK) and Src, members of integrin complexes and
key mediators of signaling downstream of integrins [39],
were measured. H929 transfected with pCrl or specific
siRNAs were cultured in FN-coated slides overnight and
were examined for the phosphorylation of tyrosine-861
(Tyr861) of FAK by confocal microscopy. As shown in
Figure 5A, the activation of FAK was enhanced in the cells
overexpressing reelin and reduced in the cells with reelin
knock-down (also shown in Supplemental Figure 4A).

The anti-apoptotic molecules Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and
survivin that are upregulated by reelin overexpression are
targets of signal transducer and activator of transcription
(STAT)3. Therefore, we examined whether reelin/integrin
β1 could activate this oncogenic transcription factor.
Compared with the vector control, a slight increase in
STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr-705 was already seen in
pCrl-transfected H929 cells without FN (Figure 6A-6B).
The same cells further enhanced STAT3 activation when
FN was present (Figure 6A-6B). The total amount of
STAT3, however, did not change.

The phosphorylation of STAT3 by integrin β2
was reported recently in acute myeloid leukemia [42]
and cutaneous T-lymphoma [43]. The integrin-activated
spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) was shown to promote
STAT3 phosphorylation [42, 44]. To determine whether
Syk activation is also associated with reelin-induced β1
activation and STAT3 phosphorylation, the phosphorylation
of Syk at Tyr525/526 was examined in reelin-overexpressing
H929 cells. Similar to the results of STAT3, more Syk
phosphorylation was seen in pCrl-transfected cells than in

control cells in the presence of FN (Figure 6A). Furthermore,
upon Dox treatment, H929 cells with pCrl-transfection
showed enhanced activation of Syk and STAT3, whereas
the cells with reelin-specific siRNA transfection exhibited
decreased phosphorylation of these two molecules (Figure
6C-6D). Similar results were obtained in pCrl-transfected
U266 cells (Supplemental Figure 4C). In addition, enhanced
FAK, Src, and STAT3 activation could be also observed
in U266 and RPMI8226 cells when treated with rReelin
(Supplemental Figure 4D-4E).

A previous report indicated that the concomitant
exposure of MM cells to IL-6 and FN adhesion increased
STAT3 phosphorylation [45]. We thus determined if reelin
activates STAT3 via IL-6 induction. However, neither
IL-6 production nor JAK2 phosphorylation were altered
following reelin-expressing plasmid or siRNA transfection
(Figure 6C and Supplemental Figure 4F-4G). In addition,
the decrease in FAK, Syk, STAT3, and Akt activation in
cells transfected with reelin-specific siRNA was abolished
when these cells were replenished with recombinant reelin
protein (Figure 6E), confirming a role of STAT3 activation
in reelin/integrin pathway. We further examined if reelin-

induced CAM-DR of MM cells is mediated by STAT3.
As shown in Supplemental Figure 4H-4J, STAT3-specific
siRNAs abolished reelin’s effect on promoting the survival
of Dox-treated H929 cells. But FN adhesion of H929 cells
transfected with pCrl was not decreased by STAT3 siRNAs.
We next used inhibitory antibodies or chemicals
against these signaling molecules to further examine the
signaling pathways activated by reelin. Upon treatment of
H929 cells with β1 inhibitory antibody P4C10, the enhanced
phosphorylation of FAK and the subsequent activation of Src,
Syk, STAT3, and Akt disappeared in reelin-overexpressing
cells, confirming the activation of integrin β1 signaling by

reelin (Figure 6F). The addition of Src kinase inhibitor PP2
to the pCrl-transfected cells resulted in a strong decreases
in Src, Syk, STAT3 and Akt activation (Figure 6F). As the
maximal activation of FAK, including the phosphorylation
of Tyr861, depends on the recruitment and activation of
Src, the phosphorylation of FAK Tyr861, but not Tyr397,
was also suppressed by PP2 (Figure 6F). The Syk inhibitor,
BAY61-3606, suppressed the activation of Syk, STAT3 and
Akt, whereas the phosphorylation of the upstream molecules
FAK and Src were not inhibited (Figure 6F), suggesting that
reelin-induced Syk phosphorylation is a result of FAK/Src
activation and the subsequent activation of STAT3 and Akt
requires Syk phosphorylation. The treatment of H929 cells
with LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K), decreased the activation of Akt, but not that of
FAK, Src, Syk, and STAT3 (Figure 6F). Taken together,
these results indicate that reelin promotes the adhesion and
CAM-DR of MM cells by activating integrin β1/FAK and its
downstream Src-Syk-STAT3/Akt pathway.

and the subsequent activation of Akt and STAT3 signaling
molecules, eventually facilitating the survival and drug
resistance of myeloma cells.
The activation of integrin β1 signaling pathways
regulates a variety of tumor cell functions [51-52].
Specifically, the engagement and clustering of integrins
by reelin allows FAK Tyr397 autophosphorylation. The
maximal activation of FAK, including the phosphorylation
of Tyr861, depends on the recruitment and activation
of Src. Thus, a Src inhibitor could suppress the
phosphorylation of FAK Tyr861 induced by reelin (Figure
6D). Phosphorylated FAK could also activate ERK1/2 via
FAK/Ras GTPase/Raf1/MEK1/ERK1/2 pathway [39].
However, we did not observe an increase in ERK1/2
phosphorylation upon reelin-induced integrin activation,
suggesting that this pathway may not play an essential role
in reelin/integrin β1 signaling.
The activation of Syk in integrin signaling is a
recent discovery [40, 42, 53-54]. Inhibition of Syk, or Syk
knockdown, suppressed VCAM-1-induced Akt activation
and cell adhesion in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells
[40]. Whether integrin-induced Syk activation occurs
in MM cells was not known. Here, we show that Syk is
activated by reelin-induced β1 engagement in MM cells.
Such activation could be reduced or blocked by reelinspecific siRNAs, or by treatment with a β1 inhibitory
antibody or Src inhibitor, whereas replenishment of
recombinant reelin to siRNA-transfected cells alleviated
the inhibition of Syk phosphorylation. This suggests that
reelin-induced Syk phosphorylation requires the activation
of integrin β1 and Src (Figure 7).

DISCUSSION
Altered reelin expression has been found in many
types of tumors [24-26, 46-50]. Except for a pancreatic
cancer cell line that showed the involvement of the
well-studied reelin receptors ApoER2/VLDLR and
their key adaptor protein, Dab1, in the suppression of
cell migration by reelin [46], none of the studies have
investigated reelin’s functions and signaling pathways in
tumorigenesis. In this study, we show that reelin produced
by MM cells promotes the adhesion of tumor cells to
fibronectin via activation of integrin β1-FAK pathway

We also showed, for the first time, that reelininduced integrin β1 activation and subsequent Syk
phosphorylation results in STAT3 activation and
up-regulation of STAT3 target gene expression.
The oncogenic transcription factor STAT3 is often
constitutively activated in various types of human
cancer, including MM, and is closely associated with
cancer cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis [55]. In
MM cells specifically, IL-6 is believed to contribute
to the activation of Jak2/STAT3 pathway [45]. The
phosphorylation of STAT3 by integrin-activated Syk
was only recently found in acute myeloid leukemia
cells and T-lymphoma cells, but not in activated B
lymphoid cells [42-43]. The current study indicates
that the plasma cell malignancy is also associated with
Syk-activated STAT3 directly downstream of reelininduced integrin β1 engagement and FAK/Src activation
(Figure 7). The activation of STAT3 in MM cells in turn
upregulates its target gene expression, including antiapoptotic members Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and survivin, resulting
in improved survival upon Doxorubicin treatment.
It was reported that STAT3 phosphorylation
induced by LFA-1 (αLβ2) cross-linking promoted the
migration of T-lymphoma cell line via binding with
microtubule-destabilizing protein stathmin [43]. T cell
adhesion and the actin cytoskeletal network, however,
were not suppressed by STAT3-inhibitory peptide. In our
results, reelin-induced MM cell adhesion was also not
abolished when STAT3-specific siRNAs were introduced
into the cells. Whether integrin β1-induced STAT3
activation facilitates the migration of MM cells awaits
further investigation.
Syk is also an upstream regulator of anti-apoptotic
PI3K-Akt pathway [56]. Our results revealed that the
phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 in MM cells upon
reelin stimulation could be suppressed by Syk inhibitor
(Figure 7). The activation of Akt subsequently upregulated
its downstream target, survivin, in reelin-overexpressing
MM cells.
Taken together, we demonstrate that reelin promotes
MM cell adhesion, survival, and drug resistance via
activation of integrin α5β1. The β1 activation subsequently
results in phosphorylation of non-receptor tyrosine kinase
FAK/Src and Syk, which in turn activates STAT3 and Akt
(Figure 7), leading to the promotion of tumor cell survival.
In addition, these findings further highlight the therapeutic
potential of targeting the reelin/integrin/FAK/STAT3 axis.

H929) and U266 were kindly provided by Prof. Jian
Hou from Shanghai Chang Zheng Hospital and Prof.
Yu Zhang from Peking University Health Science
Center (Beijing, China), respectively. H929, U266,
and RPMI8226 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640
(GibCo, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA)
supplemented with 10% or 20% (RPMI8226) fetal
bovine serum (Hyclone, ThermoFisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA). All the cell cultures were
supplemented with 2 mmol/L glutamine and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin (GibCo) and were cultured at
37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.
Primary MM cells were obtained from the BM
aspirates of MM patients at the time of diagnostic
procedure. The BM aspirates of 3 healthy donors were
also obtained. All the samples were collected after
informed consent and in compliance with the Declaration
of Helsinki under a protocol approved by the Research
Ethics Board in Peking University Health Science Center
and People’s Hospital. The samples were centrifuged over
Ficoll-Paque (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON, USA) and the
isolated mononuclear cells were stained with anti-CD138
antibody. The CD138+ cells were sorted using FACS Arial
II (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA, USA). The purity of
MM cell populations was >97% when analyzed by flow
cytometry.

Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from the indicated cells
using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA
was synthesized using the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA
Synthesis kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China). Real-time PCR
was performed using a PCR Master Mix (Roche, Basel
Schweiz, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Quantitative PCR was performed on an iCycler
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The primer
sequences are shown in Supplemental Table 1 and 2. The
PCR conditions were 94 °C for 12s, 60/58 °C for 12s, and
72 °C for 12s. The quantification was based on ∆∆CT
calculations and was normalized to GAPDH as loading
controls.

Flow cytometric analysis
Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a
FACS Gallios (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA).
Anti-CD138-PE, anti-CD138-APC, and anti-CD29APC antibodies were purchased from eBioscience (San
Diego, CA, USA), PE control mouse IgG antibodies
from BioLegend (San Diego, CA, USA), anti-CD29-PE
(HUTS-21), anti-AnnexinV-FITC, and anti-AnnexinVAPC antibodies were from BD PharMingen (San Diego,

temperature. The cells were then analyzed by FACS Arial
II. To determine the level of nonspecific binding, the cells
were stained in parallel with the PE isotype control mouse
IgG antibodies.

Full-length reelin expression vector, pCrl, was
a generous gift from Prof. Tom Curran (The Children’s
Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA). pcDNA3
was used as a control vector. siRNAs against RELN and
APOER2 were purchased from RIBOBIO (Guangzhou,
China). MM cells growing at logarithmic phase were
transfected with either 10μg pCrl or control vector
pcDNA3, or 300pmol reelin-specific siRNA, negative
control siRNA (siNC), or a specific control siRNA
with nucleic acid mutations around the cleavage site
(m-siRNA1) using electroporation (Multiporator,
Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The sequences of
siRNAs were shown in Supplemental Table 3.

Cell apoptosis assay
To assess the drug-induced apoptosis of HMCLs,
H929 cells transfected with pCrl or reelin-specific
siRNAs were treated with 2 μmol/L Doxorubicin (Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) for 24
h in 5% BSA- or 40 μg/ml of FN-coated plate. The
recombinant reelin (1 μg/ml) was also added to the
culture with siRNA-transfected cells. The cells were then
stained with annexin V antibody and the cell viability
was then measured by flow cytometry. The cell survival
was also assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assays
(DOJINDO Molecular Technologies, Minato-ku, Tokyo,
Japan), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To
measure the IC50, i.e. the 50% inhibitory concentration,
pCrl- or control vector-transfected H929 cells in
triplicate were incubated with increasing concentrations
of Doxorubicin, cisplatin (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis,
MO), and imatinib mesylate (Sigma Aldrich). The cell
viability was measured by CCK8 assay. The results were
calculated by Probit analysis in SPSS software and the
experiments were performed twice.

Cell adhesion assays
A 96-well plate was coated with 40 μg/ml of FN
(Sigma), 1 mg/ml of Poly-L-Lysine (Sigma), 1 μg/ml
reelin (R&D, Minneapolis, MN, USA), or 5% bovine
serum albumin (BSA) in PBS at 37 °C for 1 hour. BSA
in PBS (1%) was then used to block nonspecific binding
sites in the wells at 37 °C for 1 h before the experiment.
HCMLs or transfected H929 cells were pre-incubated
with recombinant reelin protein (1 μg/ml) and/or reelinspecific blocking antibody CR-50 (20 μg/ml, MBL
International Corporation, Woburn, MA, USA), and/
or the blocking antibody against integrin β1 (P4C10
clone, 20 μg/ml, Merck Millipore, Massachusetts, MA),
and/or isotype control (Ctrl) mouse IgG antibodies (20
μg/ml, eBioscience). After 1 hour of pre-incubation at
37 °C, HMCLs were washed and resuspended at 5×105/
ml in RPMI1640 with 0.1% BSA (adhesion medium).
The cells were then added in triplicate to FN-coated
96-well plates at 37 °C for 1 hour, and unbound cells
were removed by three washes with serum-free RPMI
1640. The attached cell numbers were counted for three
microscopic fields (20×) per well and averaged. The
attached cells were also stained with crystal violet and
measured by colorimetric cell adhesion assay at OD
490 using Multiskan MK3 (ThermoFisher Scientific).
For the adhesion assay using Brefeldin A (BFA, BD
PharMingen), the transfected H929 cells were treated
with BFA for 4 hours before being added to FN-coated
wells for the adhesion analysis.
