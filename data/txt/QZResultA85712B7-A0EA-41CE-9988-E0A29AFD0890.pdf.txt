Abstract
Several water-solubilized versions of the zinc ionophore
1-hydroxypyridine-2-thione (ZnHPT), synthesized as part of
the present study, have been found both to increase the
intracellular concentrations of free zinc and to produce an
antiproliferative activity in exponential phase A549 human
lung cancer cultures. Gene expression profiles of A549 cultures
treated with one of these water-soluble zinc ionophores, PCI5002, reveal the activation of stress response pathways under
the control of metal-responsive transcription factor 1 (MTF-1),
hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1 (HIF-1), and heat
shock transcription factors. Additional oxidative stress response and apoptotic pathways were activated in cultures
grown in zinc-supplemented media. We also show that these
water-soluble zinc ionophores can be given to mice at 100
Mmol/kg (300 Mmol/m2) with no observable toxicity and
inhibit the growth of A549 lung and PC3 prostate cancer cells
grown in xenograft models. Gene expression profiles of tumor
specimens harvested from mice 4 h after treatment confirmed
the in vivo activation of MTF-1–responsive genes. Overall,
we propose that water-solubilized zinc ionophores represent
a potential new class of anticancer agents. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The role intracellular free (non–protein bound) zinc plays in
regulating cellular functions is of considerable relevance to cancer.
For example, increased free zinc has been proposed to stabilize
hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and thus influence processes,
such as glycolysis, apoptosis, and angiogenesis (1–4). Moreover,
free zinc inhibits thioredoxin reductase (5), a key mediator in the
cellular response to oxidative stress that is frequently overexpressed in cancer (6–8). The importance of these targets in tumor
development led us to hypothesize that small molecules capable of
modulating free zinc levels can serve as anticancer agents.
We have recently found that motexafin gadolinium (MGd;
Xcytrin), an expanded porphyrin containing the lanthanide cation
gadolinium(III), increases intracellular free zinc levels, enhances
the cellular toxicity of zinc, and inhibits cellular bioreductive

activity in several human cancer cell lines (1, 5). In fact, the ability
of MGd to disrupt cellular zinc homeostasis provides a possible
mechanistic explanation for its anticancer activity noted in clinical
trials (9). Such considerations have led us to propose that
synergistic interactions between MGd and exogenous zinc acetate
are important for activity and that these interactions would occur
regardless of the means of zinc delivery. Indeed, MGd displayed
synergy with the zinc ionophore 1-hydroxypyridine-2-thione
(ZnHPT) in an in vitro assay measuring bioreductive activity (5).
ZnHPT is commonly used to increase intracellular zinc in vitro
and has been given p.o. to laboratory animals for toxicity testing
and to probe zinc homeostasis in vivo (10–13). ZnHPT is
extensively used as a bacteriocide and fungicide (14). However,
the complex is insoluble in aqueous media and is poorly
bioavailable (13). The goals of this study were thus (a) to prepare
a set of water-solubilized ZnHPT analogues to permit controlled
zinc delivery both in vitro and in vivo and (b) to test their biological
properties in preclinical models. This would facilitate experiments
involving ZnHPT and MGd cotreatments and also allow us to
evaluate the general utility of zinc ionophores as novel stand-alone
anticancer agents.

Materials and Methods
Materials. The synthesis, characterization, and formulation of all
compounds used in this study are described in the supplementary data.
Cells and cell culture reagents. A549 lung cancer and PC3 prostate
cancer lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.
Unless otherwise indicated, all cell culture reagents were purchased from
Invitrogen. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20 mmol/L
HEPES, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
(Hyclone) and antibiotics (200 units/mL penicillin and 200 Ag/mL
streptomycin).
Cellular and biochemical activity assays. Previously described assays
for measuring cell proliferation, thioredoxin reductase activity, the
concentration of intracellular free zinc, cell viability, and apoptosis were
used in our analyses (1). A detailed description of each assay is provided in
the supplementary data.
Gene expression profiling. A549 human lung cancer cells (1  105 per
T-25 flask in 7 mL complete RPMI 1640) were seeded 7 d before treatment of
noncycling plateau phase cultures with drug. Medium was replaced with
fresh medium 24 h before treatment. At 4 h before RNA isolation, ionophore
PCI-5002 ( final concentration, 10 Amol/L), Zn(OAc)2 ( final concentration,
25 Amol/L), the combination, or control (5% mannitol) solution was added
to the cultures. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. After
incubation, all cultures were washed twice with HBSS supplemented with
0.5% bovine serum albumin and total RNA was isolated and subjected to
analysis on Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix), as described
(1, 8). ArrayAssist software (Stratagene) was used to normalize hybridization signal (RMA algorithm) and to conduct hierarchical clustering analyses

(15). Genes at least 1.5-fold differentially expressed in drug-treated relative
to control samples with a Benjamini-Hochberg corrected Student’s t test at
P V 0.15 are reported. GeneOntology analyses were conducted using
WebGestalt software (16). All scaled fluorescent intensity values and .cel
files are available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information
Gene Expression Omnibus repository under Series Accession Number Series
GSE6972. In addition, all scaled fluorescent intensity values are available in
Supplementary Tables S2 (cell culture experiments) and S3 (xenograft model
system).
Mouse xenograft models. Details regarding the generation of xenograft
tumors in these studies are provided as supplementary data. When the
average size of tumors reached f100 mm3, mice were randomized by
tumor size to treatment groups, typically containing five to eight mice
per group. Mice were treated i.v. with two to four doses of zinc ionophore,
80 or 100 Amol/kg (240 or 300 Amol/m2), on consecutive days. Vehicle
control–treated animals received 5% mannitol on the same schedule.
Tumor and body weight measurements were performed thrice per week.
MGd was given i.p. 1 h before ionophore. For gene expression profiling,
mice were treated i.v. with one dose (100 Amol/kg) PCI-5002, PCI-5003, or
control vehicle ( four mice per group) when the average A549 tumor size
reached 500 mm3. After 4 h, tumors were harvested and snap frozen
immediately on dry ice. Tumor tissue was dissected and homogenized in
Trizol (Invitrogen), and total RNA was isolated and subjected to gene
expression analysis.

Results
Synthesis of water-soluble ionophores. We considered that
the solubilization of ZnHPT could be accomplished by attachment
of an amphoteric substituent, which would allow it to retain the
capacity for diffusion across the cell membrane. To this end, a first
water-solubilized version of ZnHPT, bearing a tri(ethyleneglycol)methyl ether substituent at the 5-position (PCI-5003), was
synthesized (Fig. 1A). Unlike the parent compound, PCI-5003 was
soluble (>12 mmol/L) in 5% aqueous mannitol.
The shorter chain analogues PCI-5001 and PCI-5002 were
prepared using analogous synthetic procedures. The corresponding ligands (PCI-5501, PCI-5502, and PCI-5503) were also
isolated (Fig. 1B). In 5% aqueous mannitol, PCI-5002 was soluble
to a level of at least 6 mmol/L. However, PCI-5001 had only
limited water solubility (<1 mmol/L in 5% aqueous mannitol).
This latter complex was formulated in DMSO and only tested in
in vitro studies. Nevertheless, we obtained PCI-5001 in single
crystalline form (Fig. 1C) and measured important bond lengths
and angles (Supplementary Table S1). This structure is notably
similar to that of ZnHPT (14), providing important support for
the conclusion that the modifications made to enhance water
solubility do not interfere significantly with the metal ion complexation properties of the 1-hydroxypyridine-2-thione (HPT)
core.
Effect of ZnHPT analogues on cellular proliferation. In A549
lung cancer cell proliferation analyses, PCI-5003 displayed an
apparent inhibitory concentration higher than that of ZnHPT
whereas PCI-5002 and PCI-5001 showed intermediate activity
(Fig. 2). The activity of ZnHPT was increased considerably by
coincubation with exogenous zinc. In contrast, the activity of PCI5003 seemed less affected by zinc at the concentrations examined.
PCI-5002 and PCI-5001 were progressively more responsive to zinc.
Similar trends were observed in PC3 prostate cancer cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
We next examined the antiproliferative activities of the noncomplexed ligands that comprise ZnHPT and its analogues. In
general, the antiproliferative activities of these ligands (HPT,

www.aacrjournals.org

PCI-5501, PCI-5502, and PCI-5503) and their corresponding zinc
complexes show excellent correlation (cf. Supplementary Fig. S2).
This indicates that the antiproliferative activities of the zinc
complexes derive in part from the activities of the ligands
(Supplementary Fig. S3).
Effect of ZnHPT analogues on cell survival. The effects of
ZnHPT and its analogues on the survival of plateau phase cultures
after 24-hour treatment were also compared. ZnHPT displayed
greater activity than PCI-5003, with PCI-5002 and PCI-5001
showing intermediate activity (Fig. 3A). However, in all instances,
coincubation with exogenous zinc(II) cation was required for
cell death at the complex concentrations tested. The amount of
zinc acetate added to the medium raised its concentration to a
level (25 Amol/L) roughly equivalent to that present in human
plasma (17).
The activities of the ligands (HPT, PCI-5501, PCI-5502, and PCI5503) were also examined in plateau phase experiments (Fig. 3B),
and these led to similar levels of cell death, but only when
supplemented with zinc. This indicates that the ligands alone are
insufficient to cause cell death in plateau phase cultures at the
concentrations tested and that the complexes are responsible for
the observed biological effects.
Intracellular free zinc measurements. Plateau phase A549
cells were treated with ZnHPT or its analogues, with or without
25 Amol/L exogenous Zn(OAc)2, for 4 hours and analyzed for
changes in intracellular free zinc by flow cytometry using the
zinc-selective fluorescent probe FluoZin-3 (18). No fluorescent

Figure 2. Zinc ionophores inhibit proliferation of A549 cells. Exponential phase A549 cell cultures were treated with zinc complexes (A–D ) at the indicated
concentrations in the presence or absence of zinc acetate [0 Amol/L (black line ), 25 Amol/L (blue line ), 50 Amol/L (green line ), and 100 Amol/L (red line )] for 72 h in
duplicate experiments. Error bars, 1 SD.

changes were observed in live-gated cells treated with 10 Amol/L
PCI-5003 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, ZnHPT (2.5 Amol/L) led to a slight
increase in FluoZin-3 fluorescence even in the absence of
exogenous zinc, although this signal was enhanced considerably
in its presence. The intensity of the FluoZin-3 signal was
enhanced slightly after treatment with PCI-5002 or PCI-5001
(10 Amol/L) in the absence of added zinc, but increased
substantially when these complexes were tested in the presence
of exogenous zinc. Cultures were also incubated with ZnHPT
or its analogues, 25 Amol/L exogenous Zn(OAc)2, and MGd
(10 Amol/L) for 4 hours and analyzed for changes in intracellular
free zinc (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these experiments indicate
that the smaller compounds are able to transport zinc and
decrease cell viability in zinc-supplemented medium. Even in
the presence of exogenous zinc, PCI-5003 (10 Amol/L) failed
to facilitate zinc transport significantly. However, it was active
at higher zinc concentrations or in the PC3 cell line (cf.
Supplementary Fig. S4).
Effect of ZnHPT analogues on lipoate reduction. Increased
levels of intracellular free zinc can block cellular reduction of
lipoate to form dihydrolipoate, principally by inhibition of
thioredoxin reductase (5). In fact, we found that lipoate reduction
was inhibited after treatment for 2 hours with ZnHPT analogues
and zinc or with MGd in zinc-supplemented medium (cf.
Supplementary Figs. S5 and S6). Inhibition of lipoate reduction
closely paralleled zinc signal and the cell death observed in cultures
treated under like conditions for 24 hours. For example, treatment
of A549 cells with 10 Amol/L PCI-5002 with exogenous zinc led to

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

70% decreased rate of lipoate reduction (Supplementary Fig. S5), a
7-fold increase in zinc signal (Fig. 3C), and f50% cell death
(Fig. 3A).
Gene expression profiling of cultured A549 cells. To
understand better the effect of a zinc ionophore on transcription,
gene expression profiles were analyzed in plateau phase A549 cells
treated with 10 Amol/L PCI-5002 for 4 hours in normal medium or
in medium supplemented with 25 Amol/L exogenous zinc. These
conditions were chosen based on the consideration that no cell
death was observed in the absence of exogenous zinc, whereas a
50% decrease in viability was measured after 24 hours with zinc
supplementation (cf. Fig. 3A). All 21 transcripts that were
differentially expressed (up-regulation in all cases; >1.5-fold
corrected P < 0.15) in response to treatment with PCI-5002
in the absence of zinc are listed in Table 1. They include transcripts
regulated by metal-responsive transcription factor 1 (MTF-1; e.g.,
10 metallothionein-related and 2 zinc transporter transcripts),
HIF-1 (i.e., HMOX1), and heat shock transcription factors (HSF; e.g.,
five heat shock–related transcripts).
Experiments conducted with the same (10 Amol/L) dosage of
PCI-5002 in zinc-supplemented medium showed 917 differentially
expressed transcripts (Supplementary Table S2). GeneOntology
(GO) analyses of the 608 up-regulated transcripts showed
enrichment (z4 transcripts, P < 0.001) for multiple functional
categories, including regulators of transcription, protein folding
genes, and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase activity
(Supplementary Fig. S7). As one might anticipate, transcripts with
cell death–related functions (e.g., DDIT3, DEDD2, and GADD45B)

were among the most highly induced (>8-fold change, corrected
P < 0.15). GO analyses of the 309 down-regulated transcripts also
showed enrichment (z4 transcripts, P < 0.001) for multiple
functional categories, including nuclear mRNA splicing
and regulators of transcription (Supplementary Fig. S8). In
contrast, no gene expression changes resulting from growth in
zinc-supplemented media were seen in the absence of added
complex. Furthermore, it was not possible to discriminate between
the zinc-treated and control cultures based on hierarchical
clustering analysis (Fig. 4). In contrast, the cultures treated with
PCI-5002 in standard or zinc-supplemented medium formed
distinct groups based on the same analysis.
Toxicity. Single-dose toxicity testing (three mice per cohort) was
conducted using PCI-5002 and PCI-5003. Both compounds were
found to be well-tolerated at the highest i.v. dose (120 Amol/kg,
360 Amol/m2) tested. Moderate signs of toxicity (transient inactivity) were observed at the highest dose level, lasting a few minutes
longer for PCI-5002 compared with PCI-5003.
Activity in tumor xenograft models. Initial xenograft studies
were conducted in CD-1 nude mice bearing A549 lung cancer
tumors (19). PCI-5002 and PCI-5003 were given to mice i.v. at a
dose level of 100 Amol/kg (300 Amol/m2) on 4 consecutive days.
Although modest growth inhibition was observed initially in
animals treated with either zinc complex (P < 0.05, days 8–16),
this effect did not maintain statistical significance at later times
(Fig. 5A ). A stoichiometric amount (200 Amol/kg) of the
corresponding ligand (PCI-5502) did not significantly inhibit tumor
growth rate (data not shown). No significant effects on mouse body
weight were observed due to treatment.
The effect of combined treatment using PCI-5003 and MGd was

also examined. In this study, MGd (40 Amol/kg) was given i.p.
1 hour before ionophore on 2 consecutive days. A slightly lower
dosage of ionophore (80 Amol/kg) was used to mitigate possible
toxicity resulting from the combined treatment. Treatment with
PCI-5003 alone was without effect on tumor growth rate, whereas
combined treatment with MGd led to significant tumor growth
delay (log-rank test, P < 0.01; Fig. 5B). No effect on body weight was
observed.
The effect of PCI-5002 treatment on the growth of PC3 prostate
cancer xenografts was then examined. It was noted previously (5)
that PC3 cells are more sensitive than A549 cells to zinc treatment
in vitro. PCI-5002 was again given i.v. at the 100 Amol/kg dose level.
In this instance, a significant tumor growth delay was observed,
wherein PCI-5002 was given on 4 consecutive days (log-rank test,
P = 0.02; Fig. 5C). Two-day treatments with PCI-5002 did not
significantly inhibit tumor growth, suggesting that more prolonged
treatment was required. As before, no effect on body weight due to
treatment was observed.
Gene expression profiling of tumor xenografts. A549
tumors, grown as described above, were treated with PCI-5002
(100 Amol/kg), PCI-5003 (100 Amol/kg), or control vehicle when
their volume reached 500 mm3. After 4 hours, tumors ( four
per cohort) were excised and homogenized, and total RNA
was extracted for microarray analysis. Hierarchical clustering of
gene expression data showed a separation of drug-treated and
control animals (Supplementary Fig. S9). However, the A549
xenografts from PCI-5002–treated and PCI-5003–treated animals
yielded similar gene expression profiles based on the same analysis.
Table 1 lists all differentially expressed transcripts in response
to treatment with PCI-5002 and/or PCI-5003. Interestingly, two

duplicate experiments. Error bars, 1 SD. A and B, percentage of Annexin-V/propidium iodide (PI )–stained cells after 24 h. C, fold increase of FluoZin-3

to ZnHPT, the antiproliferative activity of PCI-5003 was not
increased by medium supplementation with zinc acetate (Fig. 2).
Thus, we concluded that the lower activity of PCI-5003 compared
with ZnHPT did not arise solely from a decrease in the stability of
the former complex. Rather, it was considered more likely that the
larger size of the PCI-5003 inhibits cell uptake. Therefore, we

cell cultures. The dendrograms were generated based on average linkage
hierarchical clustering of expression data from 538 transcripts whose coefficient
of variation was >0.10 across all in vitro groups. Data from untreated (mannitol),
zinc-treated (25 Amol/L zinc acetate), PCI-5002–treated (10 Amol/L), and
combination-treated (25 Amol/L zinc and 10 Amol/L PCI-5002) A549 cultures are
provided in triplicate.

MTF-1–regulated transcripts (i.e., MT1F and SLC30A1) were upregulated by both drugs (Table 1). Whereas only one transcript was
down-regulated in response to PCI-5002, a total of 10 were downregulated in response to PCI-5003. However, GO analyses of these
10 transcripts indicated no enrichment for functional categories
(z2 transcripts, P < 0.001).

Discussion
Based on the hypothesis that the growth and survival of
cancer cells are sensitive to intracellular zinc levels, we sought
to prepare compounds that could be used to deliver zinc to
tumors. The zinc ionophore ZnHPT inhibits the growth of
cancer cells in culture (20), but is not appropriate for parenteral
administration, due to its limited solubility in aqueous media.
This motivated us to synthesize and characterize solubilized
ZnHPT analogues, specifically PCI-5001, PCI-5002, and PCI-5003,
bearing mono(ethyleneglycol)methyl ether, di(ethyleneglycol)methyl ether, and tri(ethyleneglycol)methyl ether substituents,
respectively.
PCI-5003 displayed antiproliferative activity in vitro, albeit at
higher concentrations relative to ZnHPT. Interestingly, in contrast

prepared the lower molecular weight congeners PCI-5002 and PCI5001 and found that the in vitro activities of these analogues were
intermediate between those of PCI-5003 and ZnHPT (Fig. 2).
Ionophore treatment led to cell death in noncycling cultures,
albeit at higher concentrations and only in the presence of
supplementary zinc (Fig. 3A). To rationalize the disparate
requirement for zinc supplementation in exponential and plateau
phase cultures, it is useful to recognize that we expect partial
dissociation of the ionophore into its constituent parts under our
conditions. In fact, it has been calculated that a 1 Amol/L ZnHPT
solution at pH 7 is composed of 43% unbound zinc, 43% zinc
bound by one ligand, and only 14% intact complex (14). Thus, we
propose that the observed antiproliferative activities of ZnHPT or
its analogues are largely due to unbound ligands that interfere with
cellular processes by binding metals. In fact, the ligands alone
displayed antiproliferative properties similar to those found for the
complexes (Supplementary Fig. S2). In plateau phase cultures,
effective concentrations tend to be higher and zinc dependent,
consistent with participation of the intact zinc complex as the
biologically active species. This interpretation is supported by the
observation that cell death in plateau phase cultures correlates
with increased intracellular free zinc levels (Fig. 3A–C).
Cotreatment of the cultures with ionophore and MGd provides
an additional means of assessing the level and importance of zinc
transport into the cells. Based on previous work (5), MGd would be
expected to increase cellular toxicity, inhibit lipoate reduction, and
increase FluoZin-3 fluorescence under conditions where the
intracellular free zinc concentration was increased via application
of an ionophore. Indeed, in medium supplemented with 25 Amol/L
zinc, a synergistic effect of MGd on FluoZin-3 fluorescence is
apparent for all ZnHPT analogues (Fig. 3D).
In the present study, we observe increased expression of
transcripts under the control of MTF-1, HIF-1, and HSFs after
treatment with PCI-5002 in normal (i.e., zinc deficient) RPMI 1640.
Widespread transcriptional activation and repression was observed
in cells treated with PCI-5002 and grown in media supplemented
with an approximate physiologic concentration (25 Amol/L) of
exogenous zinc. Notably, robust proapoptotic transcriptional
responses were observed under these conditions.
PCI-5002 and PCI-5003 were sufficiently soluble in aqueous
media to permit i.v. administration and testing in A549 and PC3
xenograft models. A549 tumor growth was inhibited transiently by
both agents (Fig. 5A). Since we had shown that MGd would
potentiate the effects of zinc in vitro (5), we also examined the
effect of i.p. treatment with MGd, followed after 1 hour by PCI5003. MGd treatment alone does not significantly inhibit A549
tumor growth (Supplementary Fig. S10). However, in combination
with PCI-5003, we observed significant tumor growth inhibition
(Fig. 5B). In the PC3 model, tumor growth was inhibited
significantly by treatment using PCI-5002 after four doses, but
not after two doses (Fig. 5C). This leads us to suggest that more

effective tumor control might be observed after more prolonged
treatment or in combination with MGd.
Growth inhibitory effects were not seen when a stoichiometric
amount of the ligand corresponding to PCI-5002 (data not shown)
was used. This leads us to propose that the effects of PCI-5002
are due to enhanced delivery of zinc to tumors, rather than
a consequence of metal ion chelation within the tumors by
the unbound ligand. Unfortunately, such controls are difficult
to interpret due to possible differences in the biodistribution of
such ligands relative to their corresponding zinc complex.
Therefore, we measured the effect of PCI-5002 and PCI-5003 on
gene expression levels in A549 xenografts to confirm the ionophore
activity of these compounds in vivo. In tumors harvested 4 hours
after administration with either compound, we observed increased
expression levels of MTF-1–regulated transcripts, such as metallothioneins and zinc transporter 1 (Table 1). Such a finding is
consistent with the zinc ionophores serving to effect zinc delivery
into the tumors.
Tumor growth inhibition in rodents has been reported
consequent to chronic zinc administration using an implanted
device or with the zinc ionophore clioquinol (21, 22). Increased
levels of intracellular free zinc activate survival pathways but can
lead to cell cycle arrest and cell death under conditions where
adaptive response mechanisms are overwhelmed. Under the
hypoxic and hypoglycemic conditions present in tumors, responses
to these stresses may be particularly important due to metabolic
adjustments made by cancer cells to adapt to their environment.
Consequently, the zinc ionophores described in this report may
display a preferential effect in tumor cells. If correct, this conjecture
would support further development of agents that provide a
sustained delivery of zinc to tumors. This approach may be
particularly germane in prostate cancer, given the unusually high
zinc levels normally found in this tissue and lost upon
transformation (17, 21).
