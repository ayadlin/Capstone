BACKGROUND: Transdermal fentanyl (TDF) is 1 of the most common opioids prescribed to patients with cancer. However, the accurate opioid rotation ratio (ORR) from other opioids to TDF is unknown, and various currently used methods result in wide variation of
the ORR. The objective of this study was to determine the ORR of the oral morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD) to the TDF dose
when correcting for the MEDD of breakthrough opioids (the net MEDD) in cancer outpatients. METHODS: The records of 6790 consecutive patients were reviewed at the authors’ supportive care center from 2010 to 2013 to identify those who underwent rotation
from other opioids to TDF. Data regarding Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale scores and MEDDs were collected for patients who
returned for a follow-up visit within 5 weeks. Linear regression analysis was used to estimate the ORR between the TDF dose and the
net MEDD (the MEDD before opioid rotation [OR] minus the MEDD of the breakthrough opioid used along with TDF after OR).
RESULTS: In total, 129 patients underwent OR from other opioids to TDF. The mean patient age was 56 years, 59% were men, and
88% had advanced cancer. Uncontrolled pain (80%) was the most frequent reason for OR. In 101 patients who underwent OR and had
no worsening of pain at follow-up, the median ORR from net MEDD to TDF (in mg per day) was 0.01 (range, 20.02 to 0.04), and the
correlation coefficient of the TDF dose to the net MEDD was 0.77 (P <.0001). The ORR was not significantly impacted by body mass
index or serum albumin. The ORR of 0.01 suggests that an MEDD of 100 mg is equivalent to 1 mg TDF daily or approximately 40
micrograms per hour of TDF (1000 micrograms/24 hours). CONCLUSIONS: The median ORR from MEDD to TDF in mg per day was

INTRODUCTION
A large majority of patients with cancer experience pain.1 Opioids are the preferred medications to treat cancer-related
pain.2,3 Chronic use of opioids may result in accumulation of the parent opioid and its metabolites, resulting in opioidinduced neurotoxicity (OIN), characterized by symptoms such as excessive sedation, delirium, hallucinations, myoclonus, and seizures.4 The preferred treatment for OIN and refractory pain involves opioid rotation (OR), which is substituting 1 opioid by another using equianalgesic tables.5-12 The lack of accurate OR ratios (ORRs) from 1 opioid to
another can result in uncontrolled pain, overdosing, or even fatal outcomes.13,14 Moreover, there are several published
equianalgesic tables involving inconsistent ORRs,13 and most of the evidence supporting the ratios are studies involving
a single-dose administration rather than chronic opioid administration.15 Almost 33% of cancer patients receiving
opioids will require OR.16,17 Apart from uncontrolled pain and OIN, rotation of opioids to a transdermal delivery system to bypass the gastrointestinal tract in patients with head and neck and gastrointestinal cancers is very common in
the palliative care setting, especially in situations related to mucositis, nausea, and dysphagia.18-20 Transdermal fentanyl
(TDF) is 1 of the most commonly prescribed opioids for cancer patients16,17 and is also 1 of the most frequently

prescribed opioids in the world.21 It has been demonstrated that an OR to TDF results in improvement of
pain, constipation, drowsiness, OIN, and even quality of
life in cancer patients.22-28 Although several studies exist on
ORRs of different opioids, the conversion from other
opioids to the TDF patch remains controversial, and the
most commonly used ratio is based on a consensus of expert
clinicians.29 The package insert for the product uses a conversion ratio of 150:1 (morphine mg to fentanyl mg).30 It
is possible that this ratio may be too conservative and may
result in insufficient analgesia, especially in patients receiving high opioid doses. Moreover, there are cases of withdrawal and uncontrolled pain after such conversions.23,3133
Several studies suggest different morphine (mg) to fentanyl (mg) ORRs ranging from 50:1 to 100:1.18,19,24,29,33
A study investigating the ORR of other strong opioids to
TDF would be beneficial in identifying a safe and effective
process of OR. The objective of the current study was to
determine the ORR from orally administered, strong
opioids (measured as the morphine equivalent daily dose
[MEDD]) to TDF when correcting for the MEDD of
breakthrough opioids (net MEDD) in cancer outpatients.
Our secondary objective was to determine the frequency,
indication, outcomes, and factors associated with successful
OR from other strong opioids to TDF.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board at The University of Texas MD Anderson
Cancer Center, which waived the requirement of
informed patient consent. We reviewed the electronic
medical records of consecutive patient visits to our outpatient supportive care center from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2013, to identify patients who were receiving
strong opioids, underwent OR to TDF, and then returned
for a follow-up visit within 5 weeks.
Patient Assessments

We collected information regarding patient demographics, including Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status; scores on the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS);34 Symptom Distress Score (SDS); Memorial Delirium
Assessment Scale (MDAS);35 the Cut Down, Annoyed,
Guilty, Eye-Opener (CAGE)36 questionnaire to screen
for alcoholism; pain characteristics; the presence of
treatment-related mucositis; history of tobacco and illicit
substance use; diagnosis of constipation by a palliative
medicine specialist; opioid use; TDF dose; MEDD;
150

body mass index (BMI); serum albumin; and indications
for OR; from the electronic medical record.
The ESAS is a validated tool for assessing the 10 major
symptoms (rated from 0 to 10) that are common in cancer
patients during the 24 hours before its administration. The
symptoms assessed are pain, fatigue, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, shortness of breath, appetite, insomnia, and
well being.34,37 The SDS is the sum of all symptoms in the
ESAS except insomnia. The MDAS is a reliable and validated
tool used to measure the presence and severity of delirium.35
The CAGE score was used to screen for alcoholism,36 because
CAGE-positive patients are more likely to be at risk for rapid
opioid dose escalation and abuse.38-40
SUPPORTIVE CARE CENTER
Interdisciplinary palliative care at our supportive care center is provided by board-certified palliative care physicians, fellows, midlevel providers, nurses, social workers, a
chaplain, pharmacists, a nutritionist, and counselors. Our
certified palliative care nurses initially evaluate the
patients and family caregivers. They administer validated
tools like the ESAS, MDAS, and CAGE questionnaire.
After receiving a detailed report from the nurses, the palliative care physician then consults with the patient and
involves the other members of the interdisciplinary teambased on the initial assessment as well as the needs of the
patient and the family caregivers. Along with thorough
assessment and management of both physical and psychosocial symptoms, discussions of goals of care and assistance with advance care planning are also provided.
Constipation is universally evaluated and treated with titration of laxatives during every patient visit in our supportive care center. A standardized model of care is
practiced, as published previously by our group.41,42
Successful OR

We used criteria that were previously published by our
team to define a successful OR.16,43,44 These included: 1)
improvement in pain, which was defined as 30% or a 2point reduction in the ESAS pain score (rated from 0 to
10) for those patients who underwent OR in the setting of
uncontrolled pain45; or 2) evidence of the disappearance
of side effects at the follow-up visit in patients who underwent OR because they developed side effects like OIN,
nausea, or itching; or 3) no worsening of the pain score
for situations in which the patient underwent OR for
other reasons, such as a need to change the route of drug
administration or a change of opioid because of drug
interaction; and 4) continued use of the new opioid at the
follow-up visit.

Successful partial OR

Successful partial OR was defined as continuation of the
previous breakthrough opioid used, even after OR from
the long-acting opioid to TDF, with the 4 criteria
described above. For example, a patient receiving
extended and immediate-release morphine can undergo
OR to TDF with continuation of immediate-release morphine for breakthrough pain.
Eligible Patients for Determination of the ORR
From MEDD to TDF

Patients who underwent OR from other strong opioids to
TDF with no worsening of pain at the time of follow-up
were included in the analysis to determine the ORR from
MEDD to TDF.44
Calculation of the TDF Dose and Net MEDD

TDF is dosed as micrograms (mcg) per hour, which
means that a 25-mcg-per-hour TDF patch delivers 25
mcg per hour 3 24 hours per day 5 600 mcg per day,
which equals 0.6 mg of fentanyl per day. The TDF dose
(in mg per day) was used in calculating the ORR of
MEDD to TDF.
Morphine, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, oxycodone, fentanyl, methadone, and oxymorphone were
defined as strong opioids. The MEDD is the total daily
dose of the opioid administered in a 24-hour period converted to an equivalent dose of oral morphine. The MEDD
was calculated using standard ORRs42; an ORR of 5.0 was
used to calculate the MEDD of methadone,46 and 1.5 was
used to calculate the MEDD of hydrocodone.44 The net
MEDD was used for calculation of the ORR from other
strong opioids to TDF. Net MEDD is the MEDD before
OR minus the MEDD of the breakthrough opioid used
along with TDF after OR. This new methodology, in
which the MEDD is adjusted for the breakthrough opioid
dose, would enable us to capture the pure contribution of
TDF alone in determining the ORR.
For example, a patient receiving morphine
extended-release and immediate-release formulations
(MEDD1 5 morphine extended release 1 immediate
release) undergoes OR to TDF plus immediate-release
oxycodone as needed for breakthrough pain
(MEDD2 5 obtained from oxycodone). The net MEDD
(MEDD1-MEDD2) is used to calculate the ORR from
MEDD to TDF.
Statistical Methods

Our primary objective was to evaluate the correlation
between fentanyl dose and net MEDD by using the ORR,
defined as TDF/net MEDD, for each patient. The variaCancer

bles of interest included patient demographic and clinical
characteristics. Data were summarized first using standard
descriptive statistics and contingency tables. Then, associations between categorical variables were examined by
chi-square test or Fisher exact tests. The Wilcoxon ranksum test was used to examine differences in continuous
variables between 2 groups. Paired t tests were applied to
test for changes in symptoms from baseline to follow-up.
Correlations were assessed between fentanyl and net
MEDD using the Spearman correlation coefficient. A linear regression model was applied to estimate the linear
association between the MEDD and fentanyl. A univariate logistic regression model was used to measure the
effects of variables on successful OR. All P values < .05
were considered statistically significant. All computations
were carried out in SAS software (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and R (version 3.0.2; R Foundation
for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
RESULTS
In total, 6790 patients attended 22,532 supportive care
center visits between January 2010 and December 2013.
Of those, 5997 patients (88%) received opioids, and 2082
(35%) underwent OR. Among those who underwent OR,
136 patients underwent OR from other strong opioids to
TDF and returned for a follow-up visit within 5 weeks.
Seven patients had missing data on MEDD, ESAS, and
TDF dose and were excluded from the analysis. In total,
129 patients underwent OR from strong opioids to TDF,
and 101 patients did not have any worsening of pain at
the time of follow-up. The median time to follow-up was
14 days (range, 3-35 days).
Table 1 lists the patient characteristics. The median
patient age was 56 years, 41% of patients were women,
70% were white, and 88% had advanced-stage cancer.
Head and neck cancers (46%) were the most common
cancer type followed by lung cancer (17%). The CAGE
score was positive in 24% of patients, 63% had a history
of smoking, and 10% had a history of drug abuse. Uncontrolled pain (80%) was the most common reason for OR,
followed by a need to change the route of administration
(9%), and OIN (9%). None of the patients underwent an
OR to TDF because of renal insufficiency. A median of 3
breakthrough opioid doses per day were used. Approximately 50% of patients had antineoplastic treatmentrelated mucositis. Patients with mucositis were more
likely to be men (P 5 .0018) and to have head and neck
cancer (P < .0001), localized disease (P 5 .0023), a history of smoking (P 5 .024) or drug abuse (P 5 .016), and
mixed (nociceptive and neuropathic) pain (P 5 .025).

Table 2 indicates that compared, with baseline,
ESAS scores for pain (P < .0001), nausea (P 5 .0072),
anxiety (P 5 .0072), insomnia (P < .0064), and SDS
(P 5 .0037) were significantly improved at follow-up. Of
129 patients, 76 (59%) underwent a successful OR.
Among patients who underwent OR for a change in route,
OIN, uncontrolled pain, and nausea, 75% (9 of 12
patients), 64% (7 of 11 patients), 55% (57 of 103
patients), and 100% (3 of 3 patients), respectively, underwent a successful OR. There was a significant improvement in constipation after OR to TDF (40 patients before
OR vs 25 patients after OR; P 5 .0112).

There were no significant independent predictors of
successful OR among the variables tested, such as age, sex,
cancer stage, cancer type, presence of mucositis, CAGE
score, history of smoking or drug abuse, BMI, albumin
level, performance status, pain characteristics, reason for
OR, and baseline ESAS score. Table 3 and Figure 1 indicate that, in linear regression, both TDF (in mcg per hour
and in mg per day) and net MEDD were significantly correlated, with a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.77
and 0.78, respectively (P < .0001). The median ORR
from net MEDD to TDF (in mg per day) was 0.01

Figure 1. Linear regression analysis of the fentanyl dose (in
micrograms [mcg] per hour) and the net morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD) ratio is illustrated. The net MEDD indicates the MEDD before opioid rotation minus the MEDD of
the breakthrough opioid used along with transdermal fentanyl after opioid rotation.

The ORR was not significantly impacted by variables like mucositis, serum albumin, BMI, TDF dose, and
success of OR (Table 4, Fig. 2). There was no significant
correlation between time to follow-up and ORR
(P 5 .53), including in patients with (P 5 .38) and without (P 5 .94) mucositis.
DISCUSSION
In this study, the median ORR (after accounting for the
breakthrough MEDD) from MEDD to TDF (in mg per
day) was 0.01, suggesting that the ratio between MEDD
and TDF (in mg per day) is 100:1. Similarly, the ORR
from MEDD to the TDF patch (in mcg per hour

[100:1000 mcg/24 hours]) was 0.4, suggesting that the ratio between MEDD and TDF (in mcg per hour) is 2.5:1.
This ratio provides a reliable, easy, and safe method for
OR from other strong opioids to TDF. However, it must
be noted that this ratio between MEDD and TDF would
not apply to opioid-na€ıve patients and only denotes an
ORR and not a ratio of equipotency. The large variability
(from 20.02 to 0.04) of the ratio demands close monitoring in all patients undergoing OR to TDF. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has determined the ORR
to TDF while adjusting for breakthrough opioid use in
cancer patients. A previous study conducted in 38 patients
with cancer in which the dropout rate was high (61%)
determined that, although a conversion ratio of 100:1
from morphine in mg to fentanyl in mg per day was safe,
the effective mean conversion ratio was 70:1.24 However
that study did not take into account the dose of morphine
used for breakthrough pain (range, 31-80 mg per day) after OR to TDF and studied the ORR to TDF from morphine alone.24
Most palliative care physicians use an ORR of 2:1
from MEDD to the TDF (mcg/hour) patch, as recommended by a consensus of expert clinicians.29 It is recommended to round the dose down if pain is well controlled
and to round it up in case of uncontrolled pain when estimating the dose of the TDF patch. However, as the
MEDD increases, this ratio may result in excessively high
doses of TDF patches, such as 300 to 500 mcg per hour
and, in some cases, may be 3 times the dose of the TDF
patch recommended by the manufacturer.30 A 2:1 ratio
from MEDD to TDF may result in a 500-mcg TDF dose
for a MEDD of 1000 mg, whereas the dose would be 400
mcg using the ratio of 2.5:1.

The net morphine equivalent daily dose (net MEDD) indicates the MEDD
before OR minus the MEDD of the breakthrough opioid used along with
transdermal fentanyl after OR.

In a randomized, open, crossover study in cancer
patients, the manufacturer’s recommendation of a morphine (mg) to TDF (mg) ratio of approximately 150:1
resulted in a few cases of opioid withdrawal, although
most patients eventually preferred TDF over extendedrelease morphine.23 There are many other reports of withdrawal symptoms noted after undergoing OR to TDF
when following the manufacturer’s recommendation.31-33
Although our study demonstrated an improvement in
constipation after OR to TDF, as previously reported,2327,47
it did not reflect an improvement in drowsiness,
unlike previous studies.27,28
TDF is increasingly the preferred source for analgesia in cancer patients who have mucositis associated with
chemotherapy and radiation. It is effective and well tolerated in patients with mucositis, because the oral route of
delivery is bypassed. It is very common for patients with
154

mucositis or gastrointestinal obstruction to undergo OR
from other strong opioids to TDF.20,48 Increasingly, fentanyl is also a frequent choice of opioid in patients with
OIN, because TDF may result in reduced metabolite formation.22,49 Half of the patients in our study were experiencing treatment-related mucositis at the time of OR to
TDF. It is important to note that, although the ORR
from MEDD to TDF did not differ in patients with and
without mucositis, patients who had mucositis may have
had a rapidly changing nociceptive input, which could
have influenced the ORR and, hence, would require closer
follow-up to facilitate titration of TDF dose.
It was reported previously that albumin levels and
BMI interfered with the ORR to TDF.50-52 However, in
our study, the ORR from MEDD to TDF did not significantly change in patients who had lower albumin and
BMI. Because of the small number of patients with low albumin levels in our patient sample, these findings need to
be validated in future studies, which also must focus on
the ORR to TDF in the presence of renal insufficiency
and in patients with cachexia.
Our study had several limitations. It was a retrospective study of prospectively collected data that included data
from only 1 follow-up visit. Although the median time
from OR to follow-up was only 2 weeks, changes like disease progression and response to cancer treatment may
have altered the pain mechanism, thereby influencing the
consumption of breakthrough opioids. Opioid doses
expressed as the MEDD in clinical studies are a compound
of several different opioids. Although calculation of the
MEDD in our study was based on published opioidconversion tables, it should be noted that there are several
such published opioid-conversion tables with various conversion ratios, which may result in a wide variation of the
prerotation MEDD. Hence, our finding that an ORR of
0.4 from MEDD to TDF (in mcg per hour) must be used
with caution and needs to be validated in larger studies that
incorporate OR from individual opioids, such as morphine, oxycodone, and hydromorphone, to TDF. Future

Conversion of MEDD to Transdermal Fentanyl/Reddy et al

studies are needed to determine the ORR from TDF to
MEDD and to validate the bidirectionality of the ORR
from MEDD to TDF. Similarly, validation studies in noncancer populations also are warranted.
Most of the patients in our study were prescribed the
TDF patch at a dose of 100 mcg per hour, and very few
were elderly. Caution must be exercised, and rounding
down is recommended in geriatric populations and also
when rotating patients from a high MEDD to the TDF
patch at doses >100 mcg per hour using an ORR of 0.4.
Like any OR, frequent monitoring and personalized titration are recommended. An ORR of 0.4 from the MEDD
to a TDF patch (in mcg per hour) provides a reliable and
effective means to rotate cancer patients from other strong
opioids to TDF.
