Colon Tumor Microenvironment That Amplify
Inﬂammation and Tumor Growth

Abstract
Inﬂammation in the colon contributes signiﬁcantly to colorectal cancer development. While aspirin reduces the colorectal
cancer risk, its action mechanism, especially in inﬂammation in
tumor microenvironment, still remains obscure. Here, we
examined this issue by subjecting mice deﬁcient in each prostaglandin (PG) receptor to colitis-associated cancer model.
Deﬁciency of PGE receptor subtype EP2 selectively reduced,
and deﬁciency of EP1 and EP3 enhanced, the tumor formation.
EP2 is expressed in inﬁltrating neutrophils and tumor-associated ﬁbroblasts in stroma, where it regulates expression of
inﬂammation- and growth-related genes in a self-ampliﬁcation
manner. Notably, expression of cytokines such as TNFa and
IL6, a chemokine, CXCL1, a PG-producing enzyme, COX-2, and
Wnt5A was signiﬁcantly elevated in tumor lesions of wild-type
mice but this elevation was signiﬁcantly suppressed in EP2deﬁcient mice. Intriguingly, EP2 stimulation in cultured neu-

trophils ampliﬁed expression of TNFa, IL6, CXCL1, COX-2, and
other proinﬂammatory genes synergistically with TNFa, and
EP2 stimulation in cultured ﬁbroblasts induced expression of
EP2 itself, COX-2, IL6, and Wnt genes. EP2 expression in
inﬁltrating neutrophils and tumor-associated ﬁbroblasts was
also found in clinical specimen of ulcerative colitis-associated
colorectal cancer. Bone marrow transfer experiments suggest
that EP2 in both cell populations is critical for tumorigenesis.
Finally, administration of a selective EP2 antagonist potently
suppressed tumorigenesis in this model. Our study has thus
revealed that EP2 in neutrophils and tumor-associated ﬁbroblasts promotes colon tumorigenesis by amplifying inﬂammation and shaping tumor microenvironment, and suggests that
EP2 antagonists are promising candidates of aspirin-alternative
for chemoprevention of colorectal cancer. Cancer Res; 75(14);

Introduction

of COX-2, an inducible form of COX under inﬂammatory
settings, have also been proved to be effective in the prevention
of colorectal cancer (6). However, extensive use of these drugs is
precluded due to their adverse effects such as gastrointestinal
toxicity and tendency to cardiovascular accidents (7, 8), making
essential development of an alternative drug for aspirin. PGs
consist of PGD2, PGE2, PGF2a, PGI2, and thromboxane (TX) A2,
which are formed from arachidonic acid by sequential actions
of COX and respective synthases (6). Because PGE2 is the most
abundant PG found in colorectal cancer (9), numerous studies
have been done to analyze actions of this PG in colorectal
cancer. However, most studies have focused on PGE2 actions on
colorectal cancer cell lines, and some on colon tumors induced
either by chemical carcinogen such as azoxymethane (AOM) or
Apc gene mutation, both of which themselves induce inﬂammation in the stroma minimally (10). Up to now, few have
analyzed PG actions on stroma components and none, to our
knowledge, studied the role of PGs in inﬂammation in tumor
microenvironment of the colon in whole animals. The latter
point is essential, because inﬂammation underlies tumor
microenvironment where various types of resident and inﬂammatory cells interact with tumor cells and promote cancer
development in reactive stroma (11). PGs exert their actions
through G-protein–coupled receptors speciﬁc for each PG, PGD
receptor (DP), four subtypes of PGE receptor EP1 to EP4, PGF
receptor (FP), PGI receptor (IP), and TXA receptor (TP; ref. 12).
Identiﬁcation of PG receptor responsible for colorectal cancer
formation and progression and elucidation of its mechanisms
are essential for development of more selective medical

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and the
fourth most common cause of cancer death (1) . One major risk
factor of colorectal cancer is inﬂammatory bowel diseases such
as ulcerative colitis (2), indicating that the pathogenesis of
colorectal cancer is closely associated with inﬂammatory
responses in the colon, and that manipulation of inﬂammation
might prevent colorectal cancer development. In fact, it is well
known that the use of aspirin or other NSAIDs is associated
with reduction of risk of colorectal cancer (3–5). NSAIDs,
including aspirin, exert their effects by inhibiting COX, an
enzyme initiating prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis. Inhibitors

PGE2–EP2 Signaling in Stroma Promotes Colon Tumorigenesis

treatment alternative to aspirin. Here, we have subjected mice
deﬁcient in each type or subtype of PG receptor to the AOMdextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colon tumorigenesis,
a model of colitis-associated cancer (CAC; ref. 13), and examined the role of PG receptors in inﬂammation-associated colon
cancer formation and progression. Our study shows that PGE
receptor EP2 is essential for colon tumorigenesis in this model,
and that administration of an EP2-selective antagonist potently
suppresses colon tumor formation.

PGE2–EP2 Signaling is critical for tumorigenesis in mouse CAC
model
To identify the PG receptor(s) responsible for CAC, we
subjected mice deﬁcient in each PG receptor, EP1 (Ptger1), EP2
(Ptger2), EP3 (Ptger3), IP (Ptgir), DP (Ptgdr), or TP (Tbxa2r), to a
mouse CAC model of AOM/DSS treatment and examined
colon tumorigenesis on day 80 (Fig. 1A). We did not include
Ptger4/ mice in our analysis, because they are available only
in mixed genetic background (16). Among the lines tested,
Ptger2/ mice selectively showed signiﬁcant reduction in the
number of macroscopically assessed tumors in the colon compared with wild-type mice, whereas the tumor number significantly increased in four other lines, Ptger1/, Ptger3/,
Ptgdr/, and Tbxa2r/ mice (Fig. 1A and Supplementary
Fig. S1A). To verify the involvement of PGE2 in this process,
we subjected mice deﬁcient in mPGES-1 (Ptges; ref. 17) to this
model. Consistent with the observation in Ptger2/ mice,
Ptges/ mice also showed signiﬁcant reduction of the tumor
number compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1A). However, the tumor number in the Ptges/
mice was signiﬁcantly larger than that in the Ptger2/ mice,
possibly reﬂecting the actions of other PGE receptors (Fig. 1A).
Notably, despite the reduction in the tumor number, the size of
tumors in Ptger2/ and Ptges/ mice did not signiﬁcantly
differ from that in wild-type mice (Fig. 1A).
Histologically, tumor lesions in wild-type mice exhibited irregular crypt structure, and enhanced mitosis and loss of polarity of
the nuclei in epithelial cells, which corresponds to the high-grade
adenoma (Fig. 1B; ref. 18). Massive inﬁltration of inﬂammatory
cells in stroma and submucosa was also observed in the colon of
wild-type mice (Fig. 1B). Although Ptger1/ or Ptger3/ mice
showed similar histology to wild-type mice (Supplementary
Fig. S1B), the colon of Ptger2/ mice mostly preserved a single-layered columnar epithelium with little inﬂammatory cell
inﬁltration, and their tumors were microadenomas consisting of
multifocal hyperplasia of crypts (Fig. 1B). Histology of the colon
of the Ptges/ mice was similar to that observed in Ptger2/
mice, but the tumor lesions exhibited more disorganized crypt
structure (Supplementary Fig. S1C). These ﬁndings suggest that
PGE2 formed by mPGES-1 acts on EP2 in cells in the colon and
facilitates colon tumorigenesis. Consistently, Ki-67 staining
showed positive signals in almost all epithelial cells in the tumors
of wild-type mice, but only in the bottom of crypts in Ptger2/
mice (Fig. 1C). When examined on day 200, the tumor number
was still signiﬁcantly lower in Ptger2/ mice and the size of their
tumors was signiﬁcantly smaller than that in wild-type mice

PGE2–EP2 Signaling in Stroma Promotes Colon Tumorigenesis

(Supplementary Fig. S1D). Although Ptger2/ mice at this stage
developed high-grade adenomas similar to those observed in
wild-type mice on day 80, their phenotypes were apparently
less malignant than wild-type counterparts as assessed as irregularity of tissue, cell, and nucleus structures (Supplementary
Fig. S1E).
We next analyzed the composition of inﬁltrating cells in the
colon of wild-type and Ptger2/ mice by FACS. Neutrophils
deﬁned as CD45þCD11bþLy-6Gþ-cells (19) were the most abundant population with the highest fold-increase in their number on
day 80 in wild-type mice, and their number was signiﬁcantly
smaller in Ptger2/ mice (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S1F).
No signiﬁcant difference was found in the numbers of CD4þ
(CD45þCD3þCD4þ) and CD8þ T cells (CD45þCD3þCD8þ),
dendritic cells (CD45þCD11bþCD11cþ) and macrophages
(CD45þCD11bþF4/80þ) between wild-type and Ptger2/ mice,
although the numbers of the latter two populations tended to be
larger in wild-type mice than those in Ptger2/ mice. Notably,
acute colitis induced by DSS was exacerbated in Ptges/ mice
(Supplementary Fig. S1G) and of similar intensity in wild-type
and Ptger2/ mice (Supplementary Fig. S1H), suggesting that the
PGE2–EP2 signaling delays inﬂammation resolution.
Neutrophils and tumor-associated ﬁbroblasts as two major cell
populations expressing EP2 in tumor lesions of the colon
Given the signiﬁcant reduction of colon tumorigenesis in
Ptger2/ mice, we next used IHC and identiﬁed cells expressing
EP2 in tumor lesions (Fig. 2A). EP2 signals, the speciﬁcity of
which was veriﬁed in Ptger2/ mouse colon (Supplementary
Fig. S2A), increased remarkably in the colon of wild-type mice
after AOM/DSS treatment, and were present as both punctate
and linear signals in the stroma and submucosa. No signiﬁcant
EP2 signals were noted in tumors themselves. Coimmunostaining for EP2 and Gr-1 showed that most of the punctate
EP2 signals overlapped with Gr-1 signals (Fig. 2A, top), the
majority of which represents CD11bþLy6-GhighLy-6Clow neutrophils (Supplementary Fig. S2B and S2C). Because the
remaining linear signals were found in the mesenchyme and
mesenchymal cells such as ﬁbroblasts are activated in tumor
microenvironment to adopt myoﬁbroblast character and called
tumor-associated ﬁbroblasts (TAF; ref. 20), we next stained the
colon with antibody to a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA), a
marker of TAFs. Signals for a-SMA indeed increased in the
proximity to tumors in the colon following AOM/DSS treatment, and overlapped with linear EP2 signals surrounding the
tumor (Fig. 2A, bottom).
To verify the clinical relevance of these ﬁndings, we examined
the expression of EP2 in the colon from patients with CAC.
Numerous punctate EP2 signals were observed in the stroma of
the colon, and the majority of these signals were costained with
NP-57 monoclonal antibody to neutrophil elastase that stained
neutrophils strongly and weakly macrophages (Fig. 2B, top;
refs. 21, 22), suggesting the EP2 expression in inﬁltrating

neutrophils also in human CAC. In addition, signals for a-SMA
were also detected in the human CAC specimen, and some
overlapped with those for EP2 (Fig. 2B, bottom).
Because both inﬁltrating neutrophils and mesenchymal TAFs
express EP2, we wondered how much each cell population contributes to colon tumorigenesis. To clarify this issue, we performed bone marrow transfer experiments between wild-type
mice and Ptger2/ mice. Transplantation of Ptger2/ bone
marrow to irradiated wild-type mice (96.5% reconstitution ratio)
signiﬁcantly reduced the colon tumor number compared with the
wild-type recipients transplanted with wild-type bone marrow
(Fig. 2C and D), suggesting the signiﬁcant contribution of EP2 in
neutrophils to colon tumorigenesis. Intriguingly, reverse transplantation of wild-type bone marrow to irradiated Ptger2/ mice
(97.9% reconstitution ratio) also signiﬁcantly suppressed the
colon tumorigenesis compared with the control group, suggesting
that not only EP2 in inﬁltrating neutrophils, but also EP2 in the
mesenchyme of recipients, possibly that in TAFs, contributes to
tumorigenesis and contributions by EP2 in the two populations
are interdependent.
EP2 in neutrophils ampliﬁes inﬂammatory signaling in a
positive feedback mechanism
Because proinﬂammatory molecules such as TNFa, IL6, and
COX-2 are critically involved in CAC (10, 23–25), we examined
the impact of Ptger2 deﬁciency on gene expression of these
molecules in the colon on day 80 of AOM/DSS treatment.
Expression of Tnf, Il6, and Ptgs2 was signiﬁcantly induced in the
colon of wild-type mice and these inductions were signiﬁcantly
attenuated in Ptger2/ mice (Fig. 3A and Supplementary
Fig. S3A). To examine the contribution of neutrophils to
expression of these genes, we performed double IHC study to
stain these molecules together with Gr-1, and found that the
signiﬁcant proportion of cells expressing TNFa, IL6, and COX-2
in the tumor lesion were Gr-1þ neutrophils (Fig. 3B and
Supplementary Fig. S3B). Because NF-kB is the master transcription factor regulating expression of these genes (26–28)
and is known to contribute to cancer formation (29, 30), we
examined activation of NF-kB in the colon by IHC for NF-kB
p65 phosphorylated at Ser276, Ser468, or Ser536 and found
that most of these signals were overlapped with those for
neutrophil-speciﬁc myeloperoxidase (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S3C). These results suggest that neutrophils recruited
to the colon induce expression of proinﬂammatory genes
through NF-kB activation, and contribute to tumorigenesis.
Because neutrophils express EP2, and the EP2 deﬁciency suppresses expression of these genes, we examined the role of EP2
in these gene expressions. We prepared na€ve neutrophils from
bone marrow as CD11bþLy-6Gþ cells (82.0% purity; Supplementary Fig. S3D), stimulated them with PGE2, an EP2 agonist
ONO-AE1-259, and dibutyryl cAMP in the absence or presence
of TNFa, and evaluated expression of these genes by qRT-PCR.
These cells expressed EP2 (Supplementary Fig. S3E), and the

of PGE2 was mimicked by ONO-AE1-259, whose speciﬁcity on
EP2 was conﬁrmed using cells from Ptger2/ mice (Supplementary Fig. S3F), and by dibutyryl cAMP, a second messenger
of EP2 signaling (Fig. 3D). In addition, PCR array analysis

ampliﬁes expression of proinﬂammatory genes as observed in
other types of cells (31).
Because the Ptger2 deﬁciency suppressed the inﬁltration of
neutrophils in the colon of AOM/DSS-treated mice, we next
examined the role of EP2 in neutrophil recruitment. To address
this issue, we ﬁrst examined expression of various chemokines
in the colon, and found that expression of Cxcl1, a chemokine
for neutrophils (32), was signiﬁcantly induced in the colon
of AOM/DSS-treated wild-type mice and this induction was
signiﬁcantly and selectively suppressed by the Ptger2 deﬁciency
(Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3H). IHC revealed that
CXCL1 was expressed at least in part by Gr-1þ neutrophils
inﬁltrating in the colon of wild-type mice and the Ptger2
deﬁciency suppressed both inﬁltration of neutrophils and
CXCL1 expression in tissue (Fig. 3E). In vitro experiment
using primary culture of neutrophils showed that PGE2,

ONO-AE1-259, and dibutyryl cAMP signiﬁcantly augmented
TNFa-induced expression of Cxcl1 as observed for Il6 and Ptgs2
(Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S3F). These results suggest that
the PGE2–EP2 pathway forms an autocrine loop for neutrophil
recruitment to the colon by inducing CXCL1 expression.
EP2 in TAFs shapes tumor microenvironment
We next studied the role of EP2 in TAFs in colon tumorigenesis.
Because TAFs secrete growth factors and tissue remodeling factors
(20, 33, 34), we examined expression of these factors in the
colon of wild-type and Ptger2/ mice on day 80. We found
signiﬁcant induction of one growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), one matrix protease, matrix metalloprotease 12 (MMP12), and one extracellular matrix protein, osteopontin, in the colon of wild-type mice and signiﬁcant reduction
of their expression in the colon of Ptger2/ mice (Fig. 4A and

Supplementary Fig. S4A). Notably, the expression of Spp1, the
osteopontin gene, was elevated about 90 folds over day 0 in wildtype mice. The Ptger2/ mouse colon exhibited the lower basal
expression and no signiﬁcant induction (Fig. 4A). IHC showed
that signals for these factors were induced and enriched in the
mesenchyme and signiﬁcantly overlapped with those for a-SMA,
indicating their main source is TAFs (Fig. 4B and Supplementary
Fig. S4B). We then used 18Co human intestinal ﬁbroblasts as a
TAF model, and incubated them with ONO-AE1-259 alone or
ONO-AE1-259 together with TNFa. ONO-AE1-259 alone

induced expression of genes for PTGER2 itself and BDNF and
together with TNFa enhanced expression of PTGS2, IL6, and
MMP12 (Fig. 4C), indicating that EP2 forms a self-ampliﬁcation
loop and shapes tumor microenvironment. Consistently, coimmunostaining for aSMA and COX-2 showed overlapping signals
in the tumor lesions (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S4B).
Notably, COX-2 staining in the mesenchyme was markedly
decreased in the colon preparation of Ptger2/ mice transferred
with wild-type bone marrow (Fig. 4D), indicating that EP2 in TAFs
is required for their activation even in the presence of inﬁltrating

neutrophils. Intriguingly, EP2 stimulation of 18Co cells also
enhanced expression of various Wnt genes (Fig. 4E), and, consistently, both basal and induced expression of Wnt5a in the colon
was signiﬁcantly suppressed in Ptger2/ mice compared with
wild-type mice (Fig. 4F). In line with the Wnt induction, examination for b-catenin signals revealed that, although positive
signals were strictly seen in cell–cell adhesion in the hyperplastic
crypts in Ptger2/ mice (Fig. 4G, bottom), b-catenin signals in
epithelial cells in the adenoma of wild-type mice spread from the
cell–cell boundary to the cytoplasm and translocated partly to the
nuclei (Fig. 4G, top).
Pharmacologic inhibition of colon tumorigenesis by a selective
EP2 antagonist, PF-04418948
To examine the potential of EP2 as a therapeutic target for CAC,
we orally administered a selective EP2 antagonist, PF-04418948
(15), to wild-type mice during AOM/DSS treatment. PF04418948 administered from the beginning of the experiment
signiﬁcantly suppressed the colon tumor formation in a dosedependent manner, and no tumor was found with the daily dose
of 100 mg/kg (Fig. 5A). Histologically, only crypt hyperplasia with
apparently normal morphology of epithelial cells was observed in
mice administered 10 mg/kg PF-04418948 daily compared with
high-grade adenoma in the vehicle-treated group (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, treatment with PF-04418948 remarkably suppressed
the inﬁltration of inﬂammatory cells and expression of CXCL1 in
the colon (Fig. 5B and C). To identify the time window for the
inhibitory action of PF-04418948, we administered this compound at 10 mg/kg/day from day 0 to 49, from day 50 to 80, and
from day 29 to 80 and examined the number and size of tumors.
Treatment with PF-04418948 from day 0 to 49 and from day 29 to
80 but not from day 50 to 80 signiﬁcantly suppressed the
formation of colon tumors to the extent seen in the mice treated
over an entire period from day 0 to 80 (Fig. 5D). However, the PF04418948 treatment affected little the size of tumors as observed

2830 Cancer Res; 75(14) July 15, 2015

in Ptger2/ mice (Fig. 5D). These results suggest the potential of
an EP2 antagonist in chemoprevention for initiation and recurrence of colorectal cancer in high-risk patients.

Discussion
Tumor growth is not only determined by tumor cells themselves, but also by the environment surrounding the tumor.
Inﬂammation underlies this microenvironment, where resident
mesenchymal cells and inﬂammatory cells interact in the stroma
to promote tumor growth through the actions of cytokines,
growth factors, growth modulators, extracellular matrix proteins,
and matrix proteases (11). The present study examined actions of
PGs in tumor microenvironment in colon tumorigenesis by
subjecting mice deﬁcient in each type or subtype of PG receptor
to the CAC model. Among the lines tested, only the Ptger2/ mice
exhibited signiﬁcant suppression of colon tumor formation with
reduced inﬂammatory responses and attenuated inﬂammatory
cell inﬁltration (Figs. 1, Fig. 3, and Fig. 4). A similar reduction was
also observed in Ptges/ mice, verifying involvement of PGE2
(Fig. 1A). EP2 is expressed in both inﬁltrating neutrophils and
TAFs in the mesenchyme (Fig. 2). EP2 stimulation in neutrophils
synergizes with TNFa to produce COX-2, cytokines, including IL6,
and a neutrophil chemokine, CXCL1. We have preliminarily
examined the underlying mechanism of this synergy, and found
that EP2 and TNFa synergistically activate NF-kB (unpublished
observation). Thus, the synergistic action of EP2 and TNFa makes
dual amplifying cycles, one for ampliﬁcation for NF-kB activation
by the COX-2–PGE2–EP2–NF-kB–COX-2 cycle and the other for
ampliﬁcation for neutrophil recruitment by autocrine production
of CXCL1 (Fig. 3). EP2 stimulation also triggers signaling ampliﬁcation in TAFs by inducing EP2 expression and producing
growth factors such as BDNF, various WNT molecules, osteopontin, and MMP12 (Fig. 4). Intriguingly, the bone marrow transfer
experiment showed that EP2 in the two cell populations is equally

PGE2–EP2 Signaling in Stroma Promotes Colon Tumorigenesis

important for tumorigenesis, suggesting that EP2 signaling in
these cell populations functions in an interdependent manner to
drive crypt hyperplasia, disorganize crypt structure to the highgrade adenoma, then convert it to adenocarcinoma (Fig. 6).
Our ﬁndings are consistent with previous studies examining the
involvement of cytokines, growth factors, chemokines, and tissue
remodeling factors in CAC. For example, TNF receptor subunit
p55 (Rp55)-deﬁcient mice or wild-type mice treated with etanercept showed reduced tumor formation in the same AOM/DSS
model (24). TNFa is a well-known pathogenic factor in human
inﬂammatory bowel diseases (35), and TNFa polymorphisms are
associated with ulcerative colitis-associated colorectal cancer
(36). Similarly, Il6/ mice developed less number of tumors in
the AOM/DSS model (23). Accumulation of CD11bþLy-6Gþ
neutrophils to the colon and involvement of CXCL1 in their
recruitment in the AOM/DSS model were also reported previously
(37, 38). The CD11bþLy-6Gþ cells we found could be granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) as suggested by
Katoh and colleagues (37). Our preliminary FACS analysis
revealed that a small population of the CD45þCD11bþLy-6Gþcells was positive for CD115, indicating that this population
could be MDSCs (data not shown). Furthermore, much has been
suggested on involvement of TAFs and TAF-derived factors in CAC
(20, 34). Here, we found that osteopontin was induced in an EP2dependent manner in the colon undergoing tumorigenesis. This
was consistent with the previous ﬁndings (39) that osteopontin
expression was induced in intestinal polyps of ApcD14/þ mice and
downregulated by treatment with a COX-inhibitor. These authors
suggested that osteopontin induction was mediated by a nuclear
factor Nr4a2, which we previously found is quickly induced
downstream of EP2 through the cAMP-PKA-CREB/CRTC2 pathway in T cells (40). Experimentally, osteopontin in tumor microenvironment has been shown to signiﬁcantly affect tumor outcome (41), and, clinically, osteopontin is recognized as a colorectal cancer progression marker (42). Our study demonstrates
that PGE2–EP2 signaling ampliﬁes the actions of all of these
molecules through amplifying expression of genes and recruitment of responsible cells.
Our ﬁndings of the EP2 expression in TAFs in the mesenchyme
are consistent with our previous ﬁnding that EP2 was expressed in
stromal region in ApcD716 mice and Ptger2 deﬁciency suppressed
intestinal polyp formation (43). Furthermore, several studies
reported expression of EP2 in various types of cancers (44–46)
and aspirin lowers the risk of solid tumors other than colorectal
cancer (4, 5). It is interesting to test how widely the EP2 actions we
found here operate in microenvironment of cancers other than
colorectal cancer.
In this study, we did not examine contribution of one PGE
receptor subtype, EP4, to colon tumorigenesis, because Ptger4/
mice are alive only in a mixed genetic background. Previously,
studies using cell lines, chemical carcinogens or Apc mutation

implicate EP4 in colon tumorigenesis (47, 48). These studies
suggest that PGE2–EP4 signaling functions directly in intestinal
epithelial cells to promote tumorigenesis. Consistent with this
idea, our preliminary study shows that administration of an EP4
antagonist does not completely suppress inﬂammation but
reduces the number of tumor formed in mice subjected to the
AOM/DSS model (unpublished observation).
Finally, this study has shown that administration of an EP2selective antagonist potently suppresses colon tumor formation.
Ptger2/ mice exhibit impaired fertilization but otherwise develop normally (49). EP2-selective antagonists are therefore supposed to be free of gastrointestinal toxicity of NSAIDs and free of
adverse tendency to cardiovascular accidents of COX-2-selective
inhibitors (8). EP2-selective antagonists also appear to be superior to mPGES-1–selective inhibitors, because tumor formation
was signiﬁcantly less in Ptger2/ mice than Ptges/ mice. EP2
was also shown to be responsible for PGE2-mediated induction of
MDSCs (50). EP2-selective antagonists can thus be a good alternative to aspirin in chemoprevention of colorectal cancer, exploiting its potent tumor-suppressing action without its adverse effects.
