BACKGROUND: Combined transperineal prostate brachytherapy and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is
widely used for treatment of prostate cancer. Long-term efficacy and toxicity results of a multicenter phase 2 trial
assessing combination of EBRT and transperineal prostate brachytherapy boost with androgen deprivation therapy
(ADT) for intermediate-risk prostate cancer are presented. METHODS: Intermediate-risk patients per Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center/National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria received 6 months of ADT, and 45 grays
(Gy) EBRT to the prostate and seminal vesicles, followed by transperineal prostate brachytherapy with I125 (100 Gy)
or Pd103 (90 Gy). Toxicity was graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 2 and
Radiation Therapy Oncology Group late radiation morbidity scoring systems. Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined
as time from enrollment to progression (biochemical, local, distant, or prostate cancer death). In addition to the protocol definition of biochemical failure (3 consecutive prostate-specific antigen rises >1.0 ng/mL after 18 months from
treatment start), the 1997 American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) consensus and Phoenix definitions were also assessed in defining DFS. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate DFS and overall
survival. RESULTS: Sixty-one of 63 enrolled patients were eligible. Median follow-up was 73 months. Late grade 2 and
3 toxicity, excluding sexual dysfunction, occurred in 20% and 3% of patients. Six-year DFS applying the protocol definition, 1997 ASTRO consensus, and Phoenix definitions was 87.1%, 75.1%, and 84.9%. Six deaths occurred; only 1 was
attributed to prostate cancer. Six-year overall survival was 96.1%. CONCLUSIONS: In a cooperative setting, combination of EBRT and transperineal prostate brachytherapy boost plus ADT resulted in excellent DFS with acceptable

Combined external beam with brachytherapy boost is commonly used for treatment of prostate cancer. Particularly for
patients with intermediate-risk disease, this approach allows for coverage of the prostate and seminal vesicles with the margin
achieved with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) combined with a high-dose boost to the prostate with brachytherapy.
Although it was routinely used as an approach to prostate cancer therapy since the late 1980s, reports of results of
this approach in the 1990s were limited to single-institution series. These series indicated that combined modality therapy
could be safely administered with promising efficacy results.1-3 In recognition of the growing use and success of this
approach to treatment of prostate cancer at individual centers of excellence, in the late 1990s both the Cancer and

Leukemia Group B (CALGB) and the Radiation Therapy
Oncology Group (RTOG) initiated multicenter phase 2
trials to assess the use of combined modality therapy as
applied across a broad range of institutions through the
cooperative research group mechanism.
CALGB 99809 was specifically designed to assess
the feasibility, toxicity, and efficacy of combined modality
therapy for treatment of patients with intermediate-risk
prostate cancer. Patients were uniformly treated with
EBRT to the prostate and seminal vesicles followed by
low dose rate (LDR) prostate brachytherapy boost with 6
months of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Longterm results of this study are now presented.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
All patients had histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma
of the prostate. A combination of clinical stage, pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and biopsy Gleason
score was used to define patients with clinically localized
intermediate-risk prostate cancer criteria as per the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk stratification
criteria as follows: clinical T1 or T2 classification with
PSA 10 and <20 ng/mL and Gleason score 6 or PSA
<10 ng/mL and Gleason score 7, or T3a with PSA <10
and Gleason score 6 were eligible for the study. Patients
with clinical evidence of nodal disease, N1, or evidence of
metastases, M1, were excluded.
An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2 was required. Patients had no prior
treatment for prostate cancer except <4 weeks of ADT,
no prior transurethral resection of the prostate, and a
prostate size determined by transrectal ultrasound at the
time of biopsy or subsequent imaging of <60 mL. Six
months of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
(LHRH) agonist therapy with either leuprolide acetate or
goserelin acetate was administered before initiation of
EBRT. EBRT was required to start within a month of initiation of LHRH agonist therapy. Four weeks of oral antiandrogen therapy with either flutamide or bicalutamide
was recommended but not required at the start of LHRH
agonist therapy to prevent a testosterone flare.
Enrolling institutions had experience with prostate
ultrasound brachytherapy with at least 50 documented
cases performed before registering patients for the study.
All participants signed an institutional review boardapproved, protocol-specific informed consent form in accordance with federal and institutional guidelines. Patient

registration and data collection were managed by the
CALGB Statistical Center. Data quality was ensured by
careful review of data by CALGB Statistical Center staff
and by the study chairperson. Statistical analyses were performed by CALGB statisticians.
Treatment Parameters
EBRT inclusive of the prostate and seminal vesicles was
administered with 3-dimensional conformal technique
using 6-MV photons to 45 gray (Gy) in 25 fractions.
International Commission on Radiation Unites and
Measurements 50 guidelines and nomenclature were used
for the study. The prescribed dose was defined on the central axis at the intersection of the beams. A total dose variation of 5% to þ7% from the prescription point dose
was allowed. The clinical target volume (CTV) was
defined as the prostate and seminal vesicles. A planning
target volume was applied to the CTV such that a block
margin of 1.5 to 2 cm was applied around the CTV. Dose
to 25% of the bladder and 50% of the rectum, defined 2
cm above to 2 cm below the CTV in the anteroposterior
projection, was limited to 45 Gy. A daily fraction of 1.8
Gy was administered 5 days per week for 5 weeks.
Brachytherapy was performed 2 to 4 weeks after
completion of EBRT by interstitial implantation using either I125 or Pd103. Preplanning was required via transrectal ultrasound performed within 2 weeks before implant;
however, intraoperative adjustment in planning was
allowed. The brachytherapy CTV was defined as the prostate identified via transrectal ultrasound with no margin.
Prescribed dose to the CTV defined per International
Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements 58
guidelines as the transrectal ultrasound-defined prostate
was 100 Gy for I125 (American Association of Physicists
in Medicine Task Group 43) or 90 Gy for Pd103 (as per
dosimetric information provided by the vendor) in addition to 45 Gy EBRT. Source strength was required to be
0.30 to 0.50 U (0.24-0.40 mCi) for I125 and 1.04 to 1.30
U (0.8-1.0 mCi) for Pd103. A postimplant computed tomography scan was obtained 3 to 5 weeks after implant
with axial images 5 mm thick obtained from at least 2
cm cephalad to the base of the prostate to 2 cm caudad
from the apex of the prostate.
Toxicity Analysis
Toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) version 2 and
Radiation Therapy Oncology Group late radiation morbidity scoring systems. Late toxicity was defined as any

toxicity persisting or occurring >9 months after prostate
implant. Patients were seen in follow-up per protocol
guidelines at 3 to 5 weeks postimplant, then at 3-month
intervals until 2 years out from implant, every 6 months
for Years 2 to 4, and annually thereafter. At each followup through Year 4, PSA, testosterone, digital rectal exam,
hemoccult, and toxicity analysis including American Urologic Association symptom assessment were required. A
central review of toxicity reporting was performed by the
study chair (M.D.H.) to ensure accuracy and uniformity
of toxicity scoring with any changes made in scoring
documented with supporting information provided by
the submitting institution to ensure transparency of the
audit process.
Statistical Design and Data Analysis
The primary endpoints were acute and late toxicity of
EBRT and brachytherapy in patients with clinically localized intermediate-risk prostate cancer who underwent
androgen deprivation. Acute toxicities were defined
according to the CALGB expanded CTC version 2, and
late toxicities were defined according to the RTOG late
radiation morbidity scoring criteria. Secondary endpoints
were biochemical failures, disease-free survival (DFS), and
overall survival (OS). DFS was defined as time from
enrollment to first observed progression (biochemical,
local, distant) or prostate cancer death. In addition to the
protocol definition of biochemical failure (3 consecutive
PSA rises >1.0 ng/mL after 18 months from start of treatment), the 1997 American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) consensus definition and
Phoenix (nadir þ 2) definition were also used in defining
DFS to facilitate comparison with other studies.
The target sample size was 50 patients. Allowing for
a 15% ineligibility rate, the total sample size was 60
patients. Sample size determination was based on the late
toxicity endpoint. A single-stage design was used to test
the null hypothesis that the late unacceptable radiation
toxicity probability at 2 years is P  .05 versus the alternative hypothesis that toxicity probability at 2 years is P 
.15. Unacceptable toxicity was defined as grade 3 or
higher toxicity, excluding sexual function. If at least 5
patients experienced late radiation toxicities at 2 years, the
null hypothesis would be rejected. This design had a
power of 89% and a type I error rate of 0.10. Acute and
late toxicities at 2 years were estimated by proportions and
95% confidence intervals (CIs) based on the binomial distribution. The Kaplan-Meier product-limit method was
used to estimate the DFS and OS distributions.

As part of the quality assurance program of the
CALGB, members of the Audit Committee visit all participating institutions at least once every 3 years to review
source documents. The auditors verify compliance with
federal regulations and protocol requirements, including
those pertaining to eligibility, treatment, adverse events,
tumor response, and outcome in a sample of protocols at
each institution. Such on-site review of medical records
was performed for a subgroup of 29 patients (46%) of the
63 patients under this study.

RESULTS
Sixty-three patients were enrolled; 61 eligible patients with
confirmed valid on-study forms were included in the analysis. The median follow-up time among living patients was
73 months (range, 0-96 months). A total of 83% of patients
received brachytherapy with I125 and 17% with Pd103.
Patient and tumor characteristics are shown in Table 1.
Both acute and late toxicity were assessed. Acute
grade 2 and 3 toxicity occurred in 25% (95% CI, 14%35%) and 7% (95% CI, 0%-13%) of patients, respectively. Urinary frequency/urgency (18%), urinary retention (7%), and proctitis (diarrhea, bleeding, and/or pain)
(7%) were the most commonly reported grade 2 toxicities.
Acute grade 3 toxicity was limited to dysuria (3%), urinary frequency/urgency (2%), and thrombosis (2%).
A complete list of grade 2 acute toxicities is shown in
Table 2. Late grade 2 and 3 toxicity occurred in 20%
(95% CI, 10%-30%) and 3% (95% CI, 0%-8%) of
patients, respectively. The most common late grade 2 toxicities were urinary frequency/urgency (7%), urinary
retention (5%), urinary incontinence (5%), and proctitis
(diarrhea, bleeding, and/or pain) (5%). Late grade 3

toxicity was limited to the 2 patients who experienced
grade 3 acute dysuria that persisted despite medications. In
both cases the dysuria resolved with longer-term followup. In 1 case resolution occurred spontaneously, and in the
second dysuria resolved after a course of antibiotic therapy.
This patient was treated empirically with antibiotics for
dysuria in the first few months after brachytherapy and
because of persistent dysuria was re-treated with antibiotic
therapy a year and a half after treatment. Notably, urinalysis was culture negative on both occasions. A complete list
of grade 2 late toxicities is shown in Table 3.
Six-year DFS applying the protocol definition, 1997
ASTRO consensus definition, and Phoenix definition of
biochemical failure was 87.1%, 75.1%, and 84.9%,
respectively, as shown in Figures 1 through 3. There were
6 deaths, only 1 of which was attributed to prostate cancer. The 6-year OS rate was 96.1%, as shown in Figure 4.

DISCUSSION
Although EBRT combined with LDR brachytherapy is a
common approach to treatment of prostate cancer, only 2
phase 2 studies conducted by cooperative groups have
been completed, including CALGB 99809. The other
study, RTOG 0019, similar to CALGB 99809, was
designed to assess toxicity, and participants were followed
up to provide an initial assessment of treatment efficacy.
RTOG 0019 included patients with clinical stage cT1c or
T2a disease and either a Gleason score of 6 or lower and
PSA levels of 10 to 20 ng/mL, or a Gleason score of 7 and
PSA levels up to 20 ng/mL. All 138 patients were treated
with EBRT to the prostate and seminal vesicles, which
comprised 45 Gy 3-dimensional conformal EBRT,

followed 2 to 6 weeks later by LDR brachytherapy boost
with 108 Gy I125. Use of up to 6 months of ADT was left
to the discretion of the treating physicians. Late genitourinary toxic effects were graded according to the CTC version 2.0, and all other toxic effects were evaluated
according to the RTOG and European Organization for
Research and Treatment of Cancer late radiation morbidity scoring system. In an initial report, median follow-up
was 19 months, and acute grade 3 toxic events were documented in 7.6% of patients. No grade 4 or 5 acute toxic
events or late grade 4 or 5 toxic events were observed.4
Increased toxicity was noted in a subsequent report with a
median follow-up of 49 months, but was deemed acceptable. Grade 3 genitourinary and gastrointestinal side effects
occurred in 10.8% and 3.1% of patients, respectively, and
grade 4 genitourinary side effects occurred in 2% of
patients. The rate of grade 3 or higher gastrointestinal
and/or genitourinary toxic effects at 4 years was estimated
to be 15%, which was higher than the estimate in RTOG
series of EBRT or LDR brachytherapy alone. Biochemical
recurrence was defined according to either the 1997
ASTRO consensus definition or the Phoenix definition.
The estimated 4-year rate of freedom from biochemical
recurrence according to the ASTRO and Phoenix criteria
were 81% and 86%, respectively.5
To date, expectations for treatment outcomes have
been primarily based on retrospective, single-institution
analyses. Sylvester and coworkers reported long-term
results on 223 patients who underwent EBRT to 45 Gy,
the majority of whom received treatment to a limited pelvic field followed by brachytherapy boost with either I125
(108 Gy) or Pd103 (90 Gy). Biochemical recurrence was
defined according to a modified ASTRO consensus criterion of 2 consecutive rises in PSA levels. With median follow-up of 9 years, applying the D’Amico and Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk stratification criteria,
the 15-year rates of biochemical freedom from recurrence
for patients at low risk in the Sylvester et al trial were 86%
and 88%, for those at intermediate risk 80% and 80%,
and for those at high risk 68% and 53%.6 Dattoli et al
reported on patients with median follow-up of 9.5 years.
Patients received a median dose of 41 Gy EBRT to a limited pelvic field up to the common iliac lymph nodes, followed by a brachytherapy boost with Pd103 (80-90 Gy).7
Biochemical failure was assessed per the 1997 ASTRO
consensus definition, nadir þ 2 definition, and absolute
PSA >0.2 ng/mL at last follow-up. Actuarial rates of freedom from biochemical failure at 14 years were 87% for
patients at intermediate risk and 72% for those at high

risk without significant variance identified when applying
the 3 definitions of biochemical failure. National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines were used for risk
stratification (intermediate risk: T2b to T2c, or Gleason
7, or PSA 10-20 ng/mL; high-risk: T3a or Gleason 8-10,
or PSA >20 mg/mL). Notably, the absolute risk of biochemical failure decreased progressively and fell to <1%
after 6 years. Other researchers have reported similarly
favorable findings in studies with shorter follow-up.8-11
There are 3 phase 3 trials inclusive of men with intermediate disease contemporary with CALGB 99809
assessing external beam with or without ADT. A trial
from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute included 206
patients with cT1b-cT2b disease (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] fourth edition criteria) with
PSA 10 and 40 ng/mL or PSA 7 ng/mL treated with
70 Gy  6 months of total ADT. With median follow-up
of 4.5 years, a survival benefit was noted for patients
receiving ADT, with 5-year OS of 88% with no deaths
because of prostate cancer. Survival without salvage ADT
was 82% at 5 years for patients receiving ADT.12 An
update with median follow-up of 7.6 years reported estimated 8-year OS of 74% with prostate cancer-specific
mortality of 3% for patients on the ADT arm of the
trial.13 The Trans-Tasman Group reported results on 818
men with cT2b-cT4 disease (AJCC fourth edition criteria) randomized to 66 Gy alone or with either 3 or 6
months of ADT. Only 18% of patients, however, were
defined as intermediate risk. For patients receiving 6
months of ADT, 5-year disease-specific survival, freedom
from salvage treatment, and prostate cancer-specific survival were 52%, 78%, and 94%, respectively.14 Preliminary results of RTOG 9408 were reported in 2009; 1979
men were enrolled, including 1068 patients with intermediate-risk disease, defined as Gleason score 7 or Gleason
of 6 or less and either a PSA of 10 to 20 or T2b disease.
Patients received 66.6 Gy  4 months of ADT. Eightyear OS with versus without ADT was 72% versus 66%,
which was statistically significant.15
A challenge in evaluating efficacy of combined modality therapy inclusive of ADT is the potential for misinterpretation of PSA rise because of testosterone rebound
after cessation of ADT with biochemical failure. Distinguishing benign rise in PSA from biochemical recurrence
is further complicated by the well-documented phenomenon of PSA bounce after brachytherapy.16-18 The 1997
ASTRO consensus definition of biochemical failure has
been shown to overestimate biochemical failure for
patients who are treated with either ADT or

brachytherapy when longer-term analyses allowing for
subsequent decline in PSA are performed.19,20 To address
this concern, the protocol definition of PSA failure, 3 consecutive PSA rises >1.0 ng/mL after 18 months from start
of treatment, was developed and applied in the analysis.
Subsequently, the Phoenix definition, nadir þ 2, was
found to have improved accuracy in defining biochemical
failure.20 To facilitate comparisons with past and future
studies, both the 1997 ASTRO consensus definition and
the Phoenix definition were assessed along with the protocol definition. The finding of a lower rate of biochemical
control in the current study using the 1997 ASTRO consensus definition in comparison with the other 2 definitions is therefore not unexpected. Ultimately, impact on
survival is the most important assessment of efficacy, and
only a phase 3 trial will satisfactorily assess survival.
Treatment efficacy is important; however, the
impact of any treatment on disease control or eradication
has to be considered in the larger context of toxicity and
quality of life. Given that prostate cancer presents without
significant symptoms for most men with clinically localized disease, and that survival is typically protracted, treatment-related toxicity is an important factor to be
considered in choosing an approach to disease management. The long-term rates of grade 2 and 3 toxicity in the
current study compare well to the other completed co-operative group study.5 We previously reported on the primary study endpoint, rate of grade 3 toxicity with 39
months median follow-up.21 Now with nearly double the
median follow-up time only a modest increase in toxicity
was noted, and only in the grade 2 category, with an
increase from 13% in our initial report to 21% in this
report. It is noted that median time to late genitourinary
and gastrointestinal toxicity is approximately 18
months.22-25 Therefore, with 73 months median followup we believe it is very unlikely that significantly more
toxicity will manifest with further follow-up. It is also important to recognize that intensity-modulated radiation
therapy (IMRT) was not allowed on CALGB 99809, as
guidelines for use of IMRT in cooperative group trials
had yet to be developed at the time of study inception.
The use of IMRT and improved brachytherapy techniques has potential to further reduce toxicity.
The excellent results of CALGB 99809 in terms of
both DFS and toxicity are notable; however, there are several limitations of the study that should be recognized.
Enrolling institutions all had experience with the use of
transperineal prostate brachytherapy, as there was a
requirement that each participating site have a minimum

5586

of 50 prior cases to accrue patients for this study. Implant
quality was excellent as assessed on central review with a
median V90 of 98%, and only 1 implant did not meet the
minimum study criteria for V90 of 80%. Therefore, the
results may not be applicable to centers with less prostate
brachytherapy experience. The study also required the use
of ADT. Although ADT has been shown to improve OS
in 3 randomized studies of intermediate-risk patients
treated with EBRT,12,14,15 no randomized studies investigating the use of hormonal therapy have been performed
for patients undergoing brachytherapy. Given the modest
doses of EBRT used in these trials, 1 hypothesis is that
with dose escalation currently in common use, ADT will
not be necessary. A new RTOG study, RTOG 0815, has
been designed to address this question. Given the potential side effects of ADT, combined EBRT and brachytherapy may be a more attractive therapeutic approach if
ADT could be omitted. Impotence is a common concern
for patients contemplating treatment for prostate cancer.
Use of ADT coupled with lack of utilization of a validated
instrument to assess sexual function made assessment of
the impact of combined EBRT with brachytherapy boost
difficult in the present study. The total number of patients
is also modest albeit sufficient to address the primary
study objective. Also, the favorable efficacy findings
would be strengthened by confirmatory findings of other
multi-institutional studies such as RTOG 0815 and
RTOG 0232, the latter of which is designed to compare
brachytherapy alone versus EBRT with brachytherapy
boost for patients with intermediate-risk disease. Results
from both of these studies will not be available for many
years; however, the current study provides valuable insight
into results achievable with combined modality therapy
across a broad range of institutions.
Conclusions
In a cooperative setting, combination of EBRT and transperineal prostate brachytherapy boost with 6 months of
ADT resulted in excellent DFS with acceptable acute and
late toxicity for patients with intermediate-risk prostate
cancer. Enrollment of intermediate-risk patients into
phase 3 trials assessing EBRT combined with transperineal prostate brachytherapy boost should be encouraged.
