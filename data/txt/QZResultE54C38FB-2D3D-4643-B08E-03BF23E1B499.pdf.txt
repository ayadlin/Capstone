ABSTRACT
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains incurable despite the introduction
of new drugs. Therapies targeting receptors and pathways active specifically in
malignant B cells might provide better treatment options. For instance, in B cell
lymphoma, our group has previously shown that scavenger receptor type B-1 (SR-B1),
the high-affinity receptor for cholesterol-rich high-density lipoproteins (HDL), is a
therapeutic target. As evidence suggests that targeting cholesterol metabolism in CLL
cells may have therapeutic benefit, we examined SR-B1 expression in primary CLL
cells from patients. Unlike normal B cells that do not express SR-B1, CLL cells express
the receptor. As a result, we evaluated cholesterol-poor synthetic HDL nanoparticles
(HDL NP), known for targeting SR-B1, as a therapy for CLL. HDL NPs potently and
selectively induce apoptotic cell death in primary CLL cells. HDL NPs had no effect
on normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals or patients
with CLL. These data implicate SR-B1 as a target in CLL and HDL NPs as targeted
monotherapy for CLL.

INTRODUCTION

patients relapse even after these therapies indicating that
further approaches are needed to enable curative therapy.
Reductions in HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) have
been documented in patients with CLL. Freshly isolated
CLL cells from patients were found to have reduced
free cholesterol, but increased cholesteryl ester content.
Treatment of the CLL cells with targeted inhibitors of
cholesteryl ester formation reduced cell proliferation
[4]. Furthermore, analysis of CLL cells obtained from
patients revealed an increase in cellular 3-hydroxy3methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA
reductase), which is the rate-limiting enzyme for
cholesterol synthesis. Additionally, data showed that

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most
frequent adult leukemia in western countries and continues
to be incurable [1]. The clinical manifestations of CLL
and corresponding patient prognoses are highly variable
[2]. Multiple internal (e.g., genetic and epigenetic) and
external (e.g., antigenic and microenvironmental stimuli)
factors have been implicated in the pathophysiology of
CLL [3]. Based on these data, more effective treatment
regimens have been designed to target specific molecules
responsible for the survival and expansion of the leukemic
clone. However, long-term cure has not been realized and

CLL cells do not utilize LDL and the LDL-receptor for
cholesterol uptake. Collectively, these data suggest CLL
cells increase cholesterol ester content via uptake of
cholesteryl ester from HDLs or by de novo intracellular
synthesis. Cholesterol metabolism, particularly inhibition
of cholesteryl ester formation and uptake, may potentially
provide new therapeutic opportunities for CLL.
Many malignant cells have been shown to
overexpress SR-B1, the high-affinity receptor for
cholesterol-rich HDL [5–9]. Cholesterol and cholesteryl
ester carried by HDLs are delivered to cancer cells
through SR-B1 [10]. SR-B1 resides in plasma membrane
lipid rafts [11] where it functions to maintain cholesterol
balance and, in a cell-specific manner, is involved in
second messenger signaling [12]. Upon binding to SR-B1,
HDL facilitates bi-directional diffusion of free cholesterol
between the HDL particle and the plasma membrane, and
delivers cholesteryl ester from the particle core to the
cell [13]. Ultimately, cholesteryl ester delivery reduces
particle size and the affinity of HDL for SR-B1 whereupon
the remnant particle disengages from SR-B1 [12]. Our
group has explored synthetic HDL nanoparticles deplete
of free cholesterol and cholesteryl ester as therapy for B
cell lymphomas. The HDL NPs are synthesized using a
5 nm diameter gold nanoparticle (AuNP) to control size
and shape. Because of the AuNP core, HDL NPs fail to
shrink in size and bind SR-B1 more tightly relative to their
cholesterol-rich natural HDL counterparts [16]. Our data
demonstrate that the HDL NPs outcompete native HDL
for SR-B1 and modulate cholesterol metabolism (i.e. via
enhanced free cholesterol removal and reduced cholesteryl
ester uptake), which potently induces apoptosis in human
B cell lymphoma in vitro and in vivo without measured
systemic side effects in the studied animal models [14–16].
We hypothesized that CLL cells express SR-B1 and
that the HDL NP would produce a therapeutic response
in primary cells isolated from patients with CLL. To test
this hypothesis we first investigated SR-B1 expression
in healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
and CLL cells collected from patients. We treated normal
PBMCs from healthy individuals and CLL cells obtained
from patients with HDL NPs and measured potential
toxicity and therapeutic response, respectively. In short,
our data demonstrate that, in contrast to normal B cells,
CLL cells express SR-B1 and the HDL NPs potently
induce apoptosis in primary CLL cells.

isolated B cells (Figure 1A). Using flow cytometry, SR-B1
expression remained negative and was not modulated in
total PBMCs or B cells after incubation with HDL NPs
(Figure 1B). We analyzed selected subpopulations of
PBMCs by flow cytometry based on side scatter (SSC) and
surface marker characteristics. Weak expression of SR-B1
was detected in the presence and absence of HDL NPs
in eosinophils [SSChigh, CD45high, CD16−, CD2+, CRTH2+]
and immature granulocytes [SSChigh, CD45+, CD16−, CD2-,
CRTH2−] (Supplementary Figure 1A, 1B). In contrast, all
other subpopulations tested including CD16+/− monocytes
[SSClow, CD2−, CRTH2−, CD19−, CD36+], cytotoxic T cells
[SSClow, CD45high, CD16+, CD2+, CRTH2+], non-cytotoxic
T cells [SSClow, CD45high, CD16−, CD2+, CRTH2+], and
myeloid progenitor cells [SSClow, CD45low, CD19−, CD2−,
CRTH2−] did not express SR-B1 by cytofluorimetric
analysis (Supplementary Figure 1C–1G). In addition,
HDL NP treatment did not significantly change SR-B1
expression in subpopulations of the PBMCs analyzed
(Supplementary Figure 1).

RESULTS

Total PBMCs from CLL patients from the USA and
Italy were treated in vitro with HDL NPs and analyzed
by flow cytometry for the occurrence of apoptosis. In the
USA, data demonstrate a significant increase in apoptosis
when the PBMCs were treated with 30 nM HDL NP
for 72 hours (Figure 4A, left). Data obtained in Italy
demonstrate no significant effect after treatment with the
30 nM dose (Figure 4A, right). Treatment of PBMCs with
100 nM HDL NPs for 72 hours demonstrated significant

HDL NPs are not toxic to PBMCs, B cells, or
T cells isolated from healthy volunteers
In order to determine the potential toxicity to
healthy cells, total PBMCs were incubated with HDL
NPs. In a cohort of healthy volunteers in the United
States (USA), no significant difference in apoptosis was
demonstrated in total PBMCs when treated with 10, 30, or
100 nM HDL NP for 24, 48, or 72 hrs (Figure 2A). Similar
data were collected in samples from healthy volunteers in
Italy, and showed that HDL NP were not toxic to PBMCs
(Figure 2B), B cells (Figure 2C), or T cells (Figure 2D).

Clinical characteristics of the CLL patients and
SR-B1 expression in CLL patient cells
The clinical characteristics of the CLL patients can
be found in Table 1. Western blot for SR-B1 was also
performed on isolated CLL cells from the patient samples
collected in Italy (Figure 3A). In addition, SR-B1 expression
was measured using flow cytometric analysis of isolated
CLL cells obtained from patients in the USA (Figure 3B).

apoptosis in both patient cohorts (Figure 4B). Importantly,
viability of normal B and T cells were not affected after 30
or 100 nM HDL NP treatment in either the USA or Italian
patient cohort (Figure 4C and 4D). The CLL clone from
the patient cohort isolated in the USA responded to 30 nM
HDL NP treatment after 72 hours (Figure 4C, left) and
the CLL clones from both patient cohorts demonstrated
significant apoptosis after 72 hours of 100 nM HDL NP
treatment (Figure 4D).

To further investigate specific killing of CLL cells, we
evaluated the effect of the HDL NP (30 nM and 100 nM) on
CLL cells isolated from the PBMCs. A dose-dependent proapoptotic effect was measured at 72 hours in samples treated
at 30 nM (Figure 5A) and 100 nM HDL NP (Figure 5B) in
both patient cohorts as compared to untreated controls.

DISCUSSION

functions. Functionally, compared with natural HDL,
the gold template used to synthesize HDL NP enables
differential manipulation of cellular cholesterol flux,
promoting cellular cholesterol efflux and inhibiting the
delivery of cholesterol ester [16]. The combination of SRB1 binding and relative cholesterol starvation selectively
induces lymphoma cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo [16].

Synthetic HDL NPs are actively targeted to cancer
cells by specific interaction with SR-B1 [14, 16–18]. In
contrast to natural HDL, HDL NPs are highly customizable,
allowing the control of many of the structural and
compositional features, which confer tailored and unique

Thus, HDL NPs are targeted functional therapeutic agents
enabled by the presence of a synthetic nano-template.
Data collected in human CLL suggest a requirement
for cholesterol ester that is satisfied by cellular uptake of
cholesterol ester-rich HDLs. Thus, we hypothesized that
CLL cells would express SR-B1, and that HDL NPs would
demonstrate a therapeutic response. We demonstrate that
leukemic B cells from patients affected by CLL express
SR-B1, and HDL NPs specifically induce apoptosis
in the leukemic B cells, sparing normal lymphocytes.
Indeed, our data demonstrate that SR-B1 is not expressed
in normal B and T cells found in the peripheral blood,
and the HDL NPs are not toxic to these lymphocytes.
The HDL NPs likely induce apoptosis in CLL cells by
reducing cholesteryl ester uptake through SR-B1. Further
exploration of this mechanism of action is under way.
These findings further expand the potential use of HDL
NP as therapeutic agents for this type of leukemia.
In the USA patient cohort, HDL NPs induced
apoptosis in CLL cells when the total PBMC cell
population was treated with the 30 nM and 100 nM dose
for 72 hours. Similar data were obtained in Italy at the
100 nM dose. In both patient cohorts, normal B and T cells
were not effected by 30 or 100 nM HDL NP treatment.
CLL cells isolated from PBMCs and then treated with
either 30 or 100 nM HDL NPs were sensitive to treatment

in both patient cohorts. Measured differences in the
potency of HDL NPs to induce apoptosis in PBMCs and
isolated CLL cells may be due to heterogeneity of SR-B1
expression in specific patient samples. More patient
samples are required in order to better correlate SR-B1
expression with sensitivity to HDL NP treatment. Further,
because a higher dose of HDL NP is more effective in
PBMCs, these data suggest that there is a protective effect
by the microenvironment, as shown with other drugs,
[19, 20] or a dilution effect due to the uptake of HDL NP
by bystander cells. In the blood of healthy individuals,
flow cytometry data indicate that SR-B1 is weakly
expressed by eosinophils and immature granulocytes,
which may play a role in the dilution effect. However, low
SR-B1 expression coupled with the low numbers of these
cells in the total PBMC population results in the lack of
SR-B1 signal when measured by Western blot. Further
study, particularly in vivo, is required to elucidate the
mechanism involved in HDL NP uptake in PBMCs and to
determine the significance of these effects.
It is important to conceptualize whether nM doses
of HDL NPs can be achieved in human patients. HDL
NPs can be synthesized and concentrated into the mid μM
concentration range such that reasonable volumes could
be delivered to easily achieve nM dosing. In addition,
intravenous administration of HDL NPs to patients with

CLL represents local delivery, which increases the effective
dose of the targeted HDL NP directly delivered to tumor
cells. Further, studies testing the HDL NP with other
therapies, including ones that also modulate cholesterol
or cholesteryl ester metabolism, or tailoring the HDL
NP to carry and deliver specific drugs are underway. The
results may provide a potent treatment for CLL where a
therapeutically active and specifically targeted “vehicle”
may show enhanced properties with selectively active
small molecules. In addition, our group has demonstrated
the tailorability of the HDL NPs with regard to nucleic acid
delivery, [21, 22] which provide a host of other opportunities
for targeted delivery to CLL and other malignancies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

HDL NP synthesis

Patients and donor samples

Synthesis was performed as described previously.
[15, 16, 22, 24].

In Italy, fresh blood samples were obtained from
patients (n = 33) diagnosed with CLL. CLL diagnosis
was confirmed according to the National Cancer Institute
Working Group (NCIWG) guidelines. [23] Patient
samples were obtained after written informed consent
following the protocol VIVI-CLL titled: “In vivo and
In vitro Characterization on CLL” approved by the
Ethical Committee at Ospedale San Raffaele, Milano,
Italy. Buffy coats from anonymous healthy donors were
obtained from ASST Rhodense Hospital (Rho, Italy).
Patients characteristics are listed in Table 1, including
biological prognostic factors such as Immunoglobulin
Heavy Chain Variable genes (IGHV) mutational status and
CD38 expression, evaluated as per standard procedures.
All patients never received therapy or were off therapy
for at least 6 months before samples were obtained.
In the USA, peripheral blood samples were obtained
from healthy individuals (n = 10, 5 male, 5 female) to
perform HDL NP uptake and apoptosis assays. Informed
consent was obtained and the study was approved by
the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board
(protocol STU00200368-MOD0001). In the USA,
peripheral blood samples were obtained from individuals
with CLL. Informed consent was obtained, and the study
was approved by the Northwestern University Institutional
Review Board (protocol NU00X3).

Western blot of SR-B1 in PBMCs, CLL cells, and
B cells
Total PBMCs were isolated from whole blood
from a healthy volunteer and from patients with CLL.
Erythrocytes were lysed using RBC Lysis Buffer (Roche,
Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Cells were re-suspended in PBS. CLL
cells were isolated per the above protocol. B cells were
isolated from PBMCs using the EasySep™ Direct Human
Naïve B Cell Isolation Kit (STEMCELL Technologies)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. B cells
were centrifuged (500 × g for 5 minutes), the supernatant
was removed, protein was isolated, and western blotting
performed as described previously. [18] For patient
samples collected in Italy, cells were lysed with RIPA
Buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) with
a fresh protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
(Roche). Western blotting was performed using 30 µg
of total protein. Membranes were incubated with 1:250
SR-B1 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) or 1:50,000
beta actin (Sigma).

SR-B1 expression in PBMC subtypes
PBMCs were washed in PBS and re-suspended
at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI medium
supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin. Cells were treated with HDL NPs (10, 30,
or 100 nM) for 24 hours in vented microcentrifuge tubes
in a humidified incubator, 5% CO2, at 37°C. The following
day, cells were centrifuged (500 × g for 5 minutes),
washed in PBS supplemented with 2% FBS, and then
re-suspended in 50 µl of PBS with 2% FBS. Cells were
then incubated with the antibodies listed in Supplementary
Table 1 (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) in accordance
with a previously established protocol [25]. After a

B lymphocyte isolation and culture from patients
and healthy volunteers
B lymphocytes expressing CD19+ were negatively
selected from peripheral blood of patients immediately
after blood withdrawal using RosetteSep B-lymphocyte
enrichment kit (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver,
BC, Canada). The purity of the cell preparations was
measured using flow cytometry (FC500; Beckman
Coulter, Pasadena, CA, USA) based upon cell surface
co-expression of CD19 and CD5. Purity was always

Dickinson (BD) LSRFortessa, Franklin Lakes, NJ,
USA). Data analysis was performed using FCS Express
Version 4 (DeNovo Software, Los Angeles, CA, USA).
The gating strategy to identify cell types based on staining
combinations was from the published literature [25].
Median fluorescent values of SR-B1 are reported, with
the median values normalized to isotype control. Relative
SR-B1 expression was normalize to healthy B cells.

Toxicity assays in PBMCs from healthy
volunteers
PBMCs were isolated from whole blood and
re-suspended in RPMI medium as detailed above to obtain
a total volume of 1.5 ml of PBMCs at 1 × 106 cells/ml.
Cells were treated with HDL NPs (10, 30, or 100 nM)
for 24, 48, and 72 hours in vented microcentrifuge tubes
in a humidified incubator, 5% CO2, at 37°C. Ramos cells
treated with HDL NPs were subject to similar analysis as
positive controls [16].
After each incubation, 500 µl of sample was retained
and centrifuged (500 × g for 5 minutes) to recover total
PBMCs. B cells were isolated from the remaining 1 ml
using the EasySep™ Direct Human Naïve B Cell Isolation
Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total
PBMC or B cell isolates were stained using the Annexin
V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (Abcam) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Flow cytometry and analysis
were performed as described above.

Cell viability was assessed by Annexin V-FITC and
propidium iodide (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using
flow cytometry (FC500-, Beckman Coulter). CD19 ECD
and CD5 PC7 antibodies (Beckman Coulter), were added
to PBMCs to determine the specific effect on the CLL
clone, which also allowed for analysis of CD5 expressing
T cells.
