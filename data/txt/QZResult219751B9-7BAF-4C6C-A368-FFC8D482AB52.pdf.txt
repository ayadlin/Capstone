Abstract
Biodegradable nanopolymers are believed to offer great potential in cancer therapy. Here, we report the
characterization of a novel, targeted, nanobiopolymeric conjugate based on biodegradable, nontoxic, and
nonimmunogenic PMLA [poly(b-L-malic acid)]. The PMLA nanoplatform was synthesized for repetitive systemic
treatments of HER2/neu-positive human breast tumors in a xenogeneic mouse model. Various moieties were
covalently attached to PMLA, including a combination of morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (AON) directed
against HER2/neu mRNA, to block new HER2/neu receptor synthesis; anti-HER2/neu antibody trastuzumab
(Herceptin), to target breast cancer cells and inhibit receptor activity simultaneously; and transferrin receptor
antibody, to target the tumor vasculature and mediate delivery of the nanobiopolymer through the host
endothelial system. The results of the study showed that the lead drug tested significantly inhibited the growth of
HER2/neu-positive breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by enhanced apoptosis and inhibition of HER2/neu
receptor signaling with suppression of Akt phosphorylation. In vivo imaging analysis and confocal microscopy
demonstrated selective accumulation of the nanodrug in tumor cells via an active delivery mechanism. Systemic
treatment of human breast tumor-bearing nude mice resulted in more than 90% inhibition of tumor growth and
tumor regression, as compared with partial (50%) tumor growth inhibition in mice treated with trastuzumab or
AON, either free or attached to PMLA. Our findings offer a preclinical proof of concept for use of the PMLA
nanoplatform for combination cancer therapy. Cancer Res; 71(4); 1454–64. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Humanized anti-HER2/neu monoclonal antibody (mAb)
trastuzumab (Herceptin, Genentech Inc.) is used alone or combined with chemotherapy for treatment of patients with
advanced breast cancer overexpressing HER2/neu (1–3). Despite
significant antitumor effects of Herceptin, it also causes serious
adverse effects on normal organs (4, 5). Moreover, many patients
develop resistance to Herceptin within 1 year of treatment, which
renders this treatment ineffective (6). Therefore, the new generation of drugs with specific tumor targeting and high accumulation in tumor cells with minimal side effects for nontumor

tissues is urgently needed to improve HER2/neu-positive tumor
therapy.
Antisense oligonucleotides (AON) that bind specifically to
mRNA and block protein synthesis are well established as
powerful and specific tools for gene/protein inhibition. Efficient delivery of AONs as well as siRNAs with systemic tumor
treatment still presents significant problems (7, 8). However,
recent preclinical studies of AON for cancer treatment showed
promising results, and AONs' stability in plasma makes them
feasible for systemic treatment (9–11). Morpholino AONs to
dystrophin were also delivered to dystrophic muscle cells
in vivo in Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse model and
patients (12, 13). Importantly, AON against HER2/neu appears
to be more potent in inhibiting neoplastic cell proliferation
in vitro than mAb inhibition of HER2/neu receptor (14).
Combination treatment of HER2/neu-positive breast cancer
cells in vitro with HER2/neu AON and conventional chemotherapeutic agents results in synergistic inhibition of
tumor cell growth by activation of apoptosis (15, 16). We
engineered novel nanobiopolymeric drugs on the basis of
PMLA [poly(b-L-malic acid)] platform that were specifically
designed for delivery into HER2/neu-positive tumors. PMLA is
a natural polymer of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum
(17, 18). PMLA is nontoxic, nonimmunogenic, and biodegradable in vitro and in vivo, stable in the bloodstream, and highly

water soluble (18–20). We recently showed that systemic
delivery of morpholino AONs against a4- and b1-chains of
a tumor vasculature-specific protein, laminin-411 (formerly,
laminin-8), to intracranial glioblastoma resulted in a marked
inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and growth (21, 22). The lead
drug tested here was designed to inhibit the synthesis of new
HER2/neu receptors with AON and to block the activity of
existing HER2/neu on the tumor cell membrane with Herceptin. To target tumor vasculature, a mAb to transferrin
receptor (TfR) was attached to the same nanoplatform. We
investigated whether the new nanobiopolymer carrying both
anti-HER2/neu antibody (Herceptin), anti-TfR antibody, and
AON to HER2/neu would enhance the specificity and antitumor effect toward HER2/neu-positive breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
Two versions of morpholino-30 -NH2 AONs to HER2/neu
Version 1: 50 -AGGGAGCCGCAGCTTCATGTCTGTG-30
Version 2: 50 -CATGGTGCTCACTGCGGCTCCGGC-30
were custom made by Gene Tools.
Highly purified, endotoxin-free PMLA, weight-averaged
molecular weight (Mw) ¼ 100 kDa, polydispersity ¼ 1.1, was
obtained from the culture broth of P. polycephalum. Rat antimouse TfR mAb R17217 (mTfR) was purchased from Southern
Biotech. Cysteamine (2-mercaptoethyl-1-amine hydrochloride), N-hydroxysuccinimide, other reagents and solvents were
of highest available purity and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Synthesis of polymalic acid nanobiopolymers
The nanobiopolymers contain 5 to 6 key components
(Fig. 1): PMLA as the backbone; morpholino AON to inhibit
HER2/neu protein synthesis; targeting anti-TfR mAb; antitumor Herceptin; 40% leucine ethyl ester (LOEt) as endosome escape unit to achieve cytoplasmic AON delivery, and
5% PEG5000 (polyethylene glycol, M ¼ 5,000) to increase
stability in the bloodstream. Anti-TfR mAb on Herceptincontaining conjugate was only anti-mouse to target tumor
vasculature. When the conjugate had only AON without
Herceptin, an anti-human TfR mAb was also attached to
it to ensure drug binding to human tumor cells and its
internalization. The preconjugate containing 40% LOEt,
5% PEG5000, and 10% cysteamine (% referring to the total
amount of pendant carboxyl groups in PMLA) was synthesized by the methods described previously (17). The antibodies conjugated with the preconjugate were qualitatively
and quantitatively assayed by size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). ELISA with purified
TfR and HER2/neu was used to verify functional reactivity of
attached antibodies as described (23).
Conjugates for imaging were fluorescently labeled with
Alexa Fluor 680 C2-maleimide (Invitrogen) by forming
thioether with sulfhydryl groups. Antibody conjugates were
then allowed to react with HER2/neu AON (Fig. 1). The control
conjugate contained Herceptin (Fig. 1) but was devoid of
HER2/neu-specific AON.

The nanobiopolymer characterization
Chemical and physical characterization of polymeric nanobioconjugate was performed by various methods, including Lmalate dehydrogenase assay, after nanobiopolymer hydrolysis
at 100 C in the presence of 6 mol/L HCl, PEG colorimetric
determination and protein quantification, size and z potential,
HPLC, and ELISA. HPLC was performed on a Hitachi analytical Elite LaChrom HPLC-UV system (Hitachi) and size
exclusion on a BioSep-SEC-S 3000 column (Phenomenex).
The nanobiopolymer variants were characterized by their size
(hydrodynamic diameter) on the basis of noninvasive backscattering (NIBS), and z potential from electrophoretic mobility on the basis of the Helmholtz–Smoluchowski formula,
using electrophoresis M3-PALS (19). Both measurements were
performed in a Zetasizer Nano System ZS90 (Malvern Instruments). Data on molecular size and z potential represent
mean  SD obtained from 3 independent measurements.
Cell lines and culture conditions
Human breast cancer cell lines BT-474, SKBR-3, MDA-MB231, MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-468, and MCF-7 were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection. BT-474, MDA-MB231, MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-468, and MCF-7 were cultured in
DMEM with 10% FBS and antibiotics. SKBR-3 was cultured in
McCoy's 5A medium with 10% FBS and antibiotics.
Nomenclature
The term "nanobiopolymer" denotes the drug delivery system
with PMLA as nanoplatform and various functional groups
covalently attached to it, specifically AON, rat anti-mouse and
mouse anti-human targeting TfR mAbs (M and H, respectively),
and LOEt as the endosomal escape unit. The newly synthesized
nanobiopolymer versions (Fig. 1, Table 1) to treat HER2/neupositive breast cancer contained either a single drug (HER2/neu
AON or Herceptin) or 2 drugs (HER2/neu AON þ Herceptin).
Cell proliferation assay
HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells (BT-474 and
SKBR-3) were seeded into 6-well plates at 3  105 cells per well.
The next day, cells were treated with PBS (control), Endoporter
(4 mmol/L; control), Herceptin (40 mg/mL), P/mPEG/LOEt/Herceptin (40 mg/mL), Endoporter (4 mmol/L) plus AON (4 mmol/L),
P/mPEG/LOEt/AON/TfR(H/M), and P/mPEG/LOEt/AON/Herceptin/TfR(M) (at 4 mmol/L AON and 40 mg/mL each antibody
for both conjugates). Seventy-two hours after treatment, the
cells were stained with trypan blue. Cell viability was determined
by calculating the mean of cell counts for each treatment group
(in triplicate) and expressed as a percentage of the total number
of cells treated to the number of cells treated with PBS.
Western blotting
BT-474 and SKBR-3 breast cancer cells were treated with
controls (PBS or 4 mmol/L Endoporter); Herceptin (40 mg/mL),
P/mPEG/LOEt/Herceptin (40 mg/mL Herceptin), Endoporter
(4 mmol/L) plus AON (4 mmol/L), P/mPEG/LOEt/AON/TfR(H/
M), and P/mPEG/LOEt/AON/Herceptin/TfR(M) (at 4 mmol/L
AON and 40 mg/mL each antibody for both conjugates). Cell
lysates were collected in 72 hours and analyzed by Western
blotting as described previously (24). Lysates of excised breast

tumors after various treatments were analyzed in the same
way. The following anti-human primary antibodies were used:

sterile PBS (control), Herceptin (4.5 mg/kg dose), P/mPEG/
LOEt/Herceptin, P/mPEG/LOEt/AON/TfR(H/M) or P/mPEG/
LOEt/AON/Herceptin/TfR(M) from the tail vein twice a week.
All nanobiopolymers were given at the same concentrations
of AON (2.5 mg/kg) and of each antibody (4.5 mg/kg) in 160 mL
per injection. Herceptin dose was determined based on FDA
approved clinical dose and was equivalent to Herceptin alone.
Treatments were performed 6 times (for 3 weeks).
Tumor xenografts were measured with calipers twice a
week, and tumor volumes were determined using the formula:
(length  width2)  (p/6).
Eighteen days after the last treatment, the animals were
anesthetized with 3% isoflurane–air mixture and killed by
cervical dislocation. Tumor samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for morphologic observation. The
data were averaged from 2 independent experiments.
Confocal microscopy
Three different versions of Alexa Fluor 680–labeled nanobiopolymers (P/mPEG/LOEt/IgG, control); P/mPEG/LOEt/Herceptin, or P/mPEG/LOEt/AON/Herceptin/TfR(M) were injected
through the tail vein of mice at the same dose as for treatment.
Twenty-four hours after drug administration, mice were euthanized; the tumors were harvested to detect the fluorescent
signal, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and embedded in OCT
(optimum cutting temperature) compound for confocal microscopy (TCS SP5 X microscope; Leica Microsystems).
In vivo imaging study
BT-474 human breast cancer cells were implanted into the
right thigh of mice as described in the Tumor Xenografts in
Nude Mice section. When tumors grew up to 120 mm3, 160 mL
of Alexa Fluor 680–labeled nanobiopolymers were injected
intravenously at the same doses as for treatment. P/mPEG/
LOEt/IgG (4.5 mg/kg IgG dose) was used as a negative control.
Drug distribution and localization was assessed in tumorbearing mice using Xenogen IVIS 200 imager (Caliper Life
Sciences), at different time points (before drug administration,
1, 3, 6, and 24 hours after the drug injection). Twenty-four
hours after drug administration, mice were euthanized and
the circulating drugs were eliminated by intra-arterial PBS
perfusion. The tumor and major organs were harvested to
detect the fluorescent signal.
Statistical analysis
Student's t test (for 2 groups) and ANOVA (for 3 groups)
were used to calculate statistical significance of the experimental results. GraphPad Prism4 program (GraphPad Software) was utilized for all calculations. Data are presented as
mean  SEM. The significance level was set at P < 0.05.

Results
Synthesis of polymer conjugates
Of the two HER2/neu-specific AON sequences (see the Materials and Methods section), version 1 did not inhibit HER2/neu
expression well in comparison with version 2 (data not shown);
therefore, only version 2 was conjugated to the polymer

platform. The absolute molecular weight of leading version of
nanobiopolymer (Fig. 1) was 1,300 kDa by light scattering and
close to the calculated value on the basis of design. Hydrodynamic diameters (nanosizes) and z potentials of the nanobiopolymers in Figure 1 are summarized in Table 1. Parameters
for z potentials in the range of –4.1 to –5.7 mV have been
reported for other nanoparticles as compatible with cell membrane attachment and nanoparticle internalization (25, 26).
The lead nanobiopolymer carrying both Herceptin and
HER2/neu AON [P/mPEG/LOEt/AON/Herceptin/TfR
(M)] inhibits growth of breast cancer cells in vitro
We have first examined breast cancer cell growth inhibition
with HER2/neu AON and Herceptin. On the basis of optimization experiments, we tested AON at 4 mmol/L with 4 mmol/L
Endoporter (in vitro AON delivery agent, Gene Tools), and
Herceptin, at 40 mg/mL. Results in Figure 2 are shown for
HER2/neu high-expressing cells BT-474 and SKBR-3, as well as
for low-expressing cells, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435. At
the concentrations used, both free AON and Herceptin
showed some growth inhibition in HER2/neu high-expressing
cells; although, low-expressing cell lines were significantly less
sensitive to both treatments. Three versions of nanobiopolymeric conjugate (one 2-drug lead variant and two single-drug
variants shown in Fig. 1) were then tested for tumor cell
growth inhibitory effect. All nanobiopolymers, Herceptin, and
free AON caused significant growth inhibition compared with
PBS control in HER2/neu high-expressing cells (Fig. 2 top; P <
0.01). The lead version produced the strongest inhibitory effect
that was significantly higher than that of other drugs including
Herceptin (P < 0.005 vs. all groups). Importantly, in HER2/neu
low-expressing cells, only the lead drug was able to induce
modest but statistically significant growth inhibition compared with PBS (Fig. 2 bottom, P < 0.02).
The lead drug inhibits HER2/neu and p-Akt expression
and induces apoptosis of HER2/neu-overexpressing
breast cancer cells in vitro
A phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and its downstream
target, the serine/threonine kinase Akt, play an important roll
in HER2/neu-positive breast cancer cell growth and proliferation, as well as in antitumor effect of Herceptin (6, 27). HER2/
neu signaling can activate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascade, and
activated Akt stimulates increases in cell size, metabolism,
and survival (28). To examine the mechanism responsible for
the enhanced growth inhibitory effect of the lead nanobiopolymer, we assessed drug effects on the expression and phosphorylation of pertinent signaling markers, HER2/neu, Akt,
and p-Akt. HER2/neu high-expressing cell lines BT-474 and
SKBR-3 were used (Fig. 3A). To further determine whether the
nanobiopolymer carrying both HER2/neu AON and Herceptin
induces apoptosis, PARP cleavage was also examined by
Western blot analysis.
In both HER2/neu high-expressing cell lines, HER2/neu
expression was inhibited to different degrees by Herceptin,
AON, and two single-drug versions of the nanobiopolymer [P/
mPEG/LOEt/Herceptin and P/mPEG/LOEt/AON/TfR(H/M)]
in comparison with controls. The strongest inhibition of

Figure 2. In vitro cell viability assay. HER2/neu overexpressing breast cancer cells (BT-474 and SKBR-3; Fig. 3A) were treated with various drugs (top row). After
72 hours, cell viability was determined using trypan blue exclusion assay. Percentages of cell growth were calculated as the average of cell counts for each group
and expressed relative to parallel samples treated with PBS (control) set to 100%. Growth of tumor cells treated with P/mPEG/LOEt/AON/Herceptin/TfR(M)
was significantly inhibited compared with other treatments in both cell lines. In cell lines expressing low amounts of HER2/neu (Fig. 3A), the only drug active in
cell growth inhibition was the lead compound (bottom row). *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.003 compared with PBS. The lead drug also showed significant
differences at P < 0.005 when compared with all treatment groups in top row, and at P < 0.02 when compared with Herceptin in bottom row.

HER2/neu expression was observed upon treatment with the
lead nanobiopolymer that had 2 drugs (AON and Herceptin)
attached to the same PMLA carrier molecule.
The expression of p-Akt, a key downstream mediator of
HER2/neu signaling (6), was inhibited to a different extent in
tumor cells treated with Herceptin, AON, or single-drug versions of nanobiopolymer as compared with control cells treated with PBS or AON transduction reagent Endoporter.
Importantly, the p-Akt signal upon treatment of both breast
cancer cell lines with the lead drug was markedly lower than
after treatment with any other reagent (Fig. 3B). The amount of
total Akt on Western blots was unchanged after all treatments.
Apoptosis assessed by PARP cleavage was induced to some
extent by Herceptin, AON, and single-drug nanobiopolymers
in HER2/neu high-expressing cells, especially in BT-474 cell
line. However, the lead version, P/mPEG/LOEt/AON/Herceptin/TfR(M), triggered apoptosis more significantly in both cell

Imaging studies in vivo showed that anti-mouse TfR and
anti-human HER2/neu combined on the same PMLA molecule provided tumor-specific drug delivery through host
endothelial system into subcutaneous human breast tumors.
Twenty-four hours after injection of drugs, they accumulated
mostly in the tumor and draining organs, kidney and liver
(Fig. 4). The nanobiopolymer with only Herceptin showed less
tumor accumulation than the version with Herceptin, AON,
and anti-TfR mAb (the lead drug), possibly because of the
enhanced targeting of tumor vasculature with anti-TfR mAb
compared with Herceptin. Control nanobiopolymer with IgG
showed only little tumor accumulation (Fig. 4).

Figure 3. Changes of HER2/neu expression, Akt phosphorylation, and apoptosis upon various treatments of breast cancer cells in vitro. A, HER2/neu
and TfR expression in cell lines. B, expression analysis of various markers. HER2/neu overexpressing breast cancer cells (a) were treated with various
drugs. Western blot analysis showed decreased HER2/neu and phosphorylated Akt in Herceptin, P/mPEG/LOEt/Herceptin, AON or P/mPEG/LOEt/AON/TfR
(H/M)-treated tumor cells but not in PBS or Endoporter-treated cells. P/mPEG/LOEt/AON/Herceptin/TfR(M) further reduced both HER2/neu and p-Akt.
Generation of cleaved PARP as a measure of apoptosis was best seen in P/mPEG/LOEt/AON/Herceptin/TfR(M)-treated cells. GAPDH was used as an
internal loading control. Breast cancer cell lines used in this study expressed high levels of TfR (A).

Confocal microscopy was performed on sections of brain
tumors removed 24 hours after intravenous injection of Alexa
Fluor 680–labeled drugs. A significantly stronger signal in
tumor cells for P/mPEG/LOEt/Herceptin was observed than
for the control conjugate P/mPEG/LOEt/IgG, and the highest
tumor accumulation was observed with the lead drug compared with other nanobiopolymers (Fig. 5).
The lead drug significantly inhibits HER2/neu-positive
breast tumor growth in vivo
We next investigated the therapeutic effect of lead drug upon
intravenous treatment using subcutaneous mouse models of
human breast tumor xenografts. We selected BT-474 cell line for
in vivo experiments because of its high HER2/neu expression
and tumorigenicity. Treatment of BT-474 tumor–bearing mice
with Herceptin, a single-drug nanobiopolymer and the lead
drug, was performed in comparison with PBS. No decrease in
body weight, morbidity or death was observed, indicating that
all treatments were well tolerated (data not shown).
All the drugs inhibited tumor growth after 6 treatments (from
days 21–38 posttumor implantation) and during follow-up to
56 days (Fig. 6B). Herceptin alone showed a similar tumor growth

www.aacrjournals.org

inhibition over time as PMLA-bound Herceptin. Both these
drugs produced a somewhat stronger effect than HER2/neu
AON bound to PMLA (Fig. 6B). This effect was significant for
all 3 drugs (P < 0.03 vs. PBS). When both Herceptin and HER2/neu
AON were combined on one nanobiopolymer, it showed the
highest degree of inhibition of tumor growth, with a clear synergistic effect compared with single-drug treatments (Fig. 6B; P
< 0.001 vs. PBS; P < 0.03 vs. all other treatment groups). The tumor
regression after lead drug treatment ranged from 80% at the
start of follow-up to 95% at the end of this period (day 56; Fig. 6B).
Moreover, tumors in the group treated with lead drug started
to regress within the first 2 weeks after the initial treatment, and
all tumors in this group remained suppressed for an additional
20 days, at which time the experiment was terminated.
H&E staining revealed that the tumors treated with Herceptin, P/mPEG/LOEt/Herceptin, or P/mPEG/LOEt/AON/TfR
(H/M) showed some areas of cell death compared with PBS
(control)-treated tumor. However, treatment with the lead
drug led to the appearance of massive morphologically necrotic areas with little unaffected tumor tissue remaining (Fig. 6A).
The mechanism of this antitumor effect was further investigated by Western blot analysis using lysates of subcutaneous

HER2/neu expression was partially inhibited by Herceptin,
AON, and single-drug versions of the nanobiopolymer [P/
mPEG/LOEt/Herceptin and P/mPEG/LOEt/AON/TfR(H/M)]
in comparison with PBS controls (Fig. 6C). The lead drug
produced the highest inhibition of HER2/neu tumor expression, in accordance with the in vitro Western blot analysis. The
phosphorylated Akt was also reduced after drug treatments.
Again, the lead drug caused the most pronounced decrease,
with little p-Akt signal left (Fig. 6C). Total Akt remained
unchanged upon treatments, as in the in vitro experiments.
Apoptosis assessed by PARP cleavage was induced to some
extent by all drugs in HER2/neu high-expressing tumors
compared with PBS treatment. However, the lead version,
P/mPEG/LOEt/AON/Herceptin/TfR(M), markedly increased
PARP cleavage compared with all other treatments suggesting
that this nanobiopolymer induced apoptosis more significantly than the other used drugs (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is one of the most effective
treatments of HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer. However, in 66% to 88% of cases, HER2/neu-overexpressing tumors
demonstrate primary resistance to Herceptin (2, 29). This
resistance may be due to epitope masking by overexpressed
mucins, loss of receptor ability to influence prosurvival signaling through PI3K–Akt axis, or loss of protein phosphatase
PTEN leading to the activation of PI3K-Akt signaling (6, 30–
32). Combining Herceptin with other agents, such as paclitaxel
and docetaxel, increased response rates, time to disease

recurrence, and overall survival (33–35). Superior antitumor
effects of these or new drug combinations can be reproduced
by an emerging class of new drugs, the nanobiopolymeric
conjugates. These compounds offer enhanced cancer cell
specificity because of the presence of tumor targeting antibodies, bypass drug resistance by delivering polymer-bound
drugs into cancer cell cytoplasm, and can carry multiple drugs
on a single platform (36). Efficient delivery of nanobiopolymerattached drugs to tumors is also increased because these
complexes exploit passive targeting through enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect typical for tumors (37) and,
in addition, active targeting using antibodies such as anti-TfR
(37–39). Moreover, as Table 1 shows, the size (<30 nm) of these
conjugates and their slightly negative z potential promote
their interaction with the cell membrane and enhance intracellular internalization. This property is widely known for
anionic nanoparticles (26). A general problem with anticancer
drugs is lack of specific tumor targeting, resulting in rather
random tissue accumulation and significant side effects for
normal tissues (40, 41). To circumvent this drawback, tumortargeting antibodies have been used as drug carriers or
directly as therapeutics (e.g., Herceptin). Dendrimer nanoconjugates with attached Herceptin displayed enhanced accumulation in breast cancer cells in animal models (41).
Methotrexate-loaded dendrimers produced a cytotoxic effect
in tumor cells in vitro resulting from Herceptin-mediated
complex internalization (40). However, the efficacy of these
nanodrugs was limited because of lack of efficient endosome
release unit (40). The polymers we have previously designed
specifically delivered drugs to cancer cells and inhibited
tumor growth and angiogenesis in brain glioma–bearing

animals (22, 42–44). Their efficiency was due to tumor targeting, use of AON drugs to more than one tumor marker at the
same time, and the presence of endosome disruption moiety
ensuring drug release inside the target cell (20).
In the present study, a new generation of this nanobiopolymeric conjugate specifically tailored for HER2/neu-expressing breast cancer treatment was designed and tested in vitro
and in vivo. The drug was based on HER2/neu inhibition by
simultaneously blocking the synthesis of HER2/neu with
specific AON and internalizing the receptor by binding to
Herceptin. The lead drug was thus meant to more efficiently
inhibit HER2/neu expression and function.
Our in vitro data showed that, indeed, the lead drug
P/mPEG/LOEt/AON/Herceptin/TfR(M) suppressed proliferation of HER2/neu-positive breast cancer cell lines significantly more than Herceptin, P/mPEG/LOEt/Herceptin
or P/mPEG/LOEt/AON/TfR(H/M) (Fig. 2). Interestingly,
the lead nanobiopolymer was effective on both HER2/neu

www.aacrjournals.org

high- and low-expressing breast cancer cell lines. With
regard to HER2/neu low-expressing cells, our lead drug
was also superior to previously used HER2/neu AON, which
did not inhibit their growth in vitro (14). Moreover, this
lead drug produced the highest inhibition of both HER2/neu
expression and Akt phosphorylation, as well as enhanced
tumor cell apoptosis, compared with other treatments.
Herceptin mediates antiproliferative effects in HER2/neupositive cells by facilitating either HER2/neu degradation
or endocytic destruction of the HER2/neu receptor or
downregulation of PI3K-Akt signaling (45) by inhibiting
HER2/neu receptor dimerization, and also by inducing
immune activation (46). In line with these mechanisms,
our data suggest that the in vitro growth-inhibiting effect
of the lead drug on tumor cells was enhanced by simultaneous AON-mediated inhibition of HER2/neu synthesis and
by downregulation of surface HER2/neu through its binding
to Herceptin. The stronger inhibition of Akt phosphorylation

produced the highest inhibition of tumor growth resulting in 80% to 95% tumor regression during the follow-up period compared with other treatment groups

P/mPEG/LOEt/AON/Herceptin/TfR(M)-treated mice compared with other groups. GAPDH was an internal control to normalize gel loading.

in this case could result from a significant attenuation of
HER2/neu signaling.
The lead drug readily accumulated in breast tumors and
dramatically inhibited human breast cancer growth in nude
mice (Fig. 6). Importantly, the magnitude of antitumor effect
of this lead drug suggests synergy between HER2/neu AON and
Herceptin in vivo (Fig. 6). In comparison, the in vitro effect was
more modest, showing only about 50% growth inhibition in
HER2/neu high-expressing cells, in contrast to nearly complete in vivo inhibition. The synergistic antitumor action
in vivo could result from a combination of several effects:
enhanced reduction in HER2/neu-mediated tumor growth by

AON together with Herceptin, preferential tumor accumulation mediated by combined EPR effect (37) and active targeting with antibodies (43), and maintenance of effective drug
concentration due to multiple treatments. Compared with the
previously used combination of HER2/neu AON with doxorubicin that was similarly effective against xenogeneic BT-474
tumors (14), our nanobiopolymeric conjugate would be free of
side effects because of absence of toxic doxorubicin and of its
efficient tumor targeting via Herceptin and anti-TfR.
Our experiments confirmed that a proper design of the lead
nanobiopolymer was possible for efficient blocking of HER2/
neu-positive breast tumor growth through dual inhibition of

HER2/neu and Akt phosphorylation, and as a result, promoting enhanced tumor cell apoptosis. The nanobiopolymer's
unique combination of features resulted in highly specific
drug accumulation in the tumor tissue and inside tumor cells.
Our nanobiopolymer can accommodate virtually any antibody, drug, or AON, alone or in combination. By this virtue, the
nanodrug can be tailored to target simultaneously different
molecular tumor markers typical of particular tumor cells to
become highly efficient against various tumors. This novel
nanobiopolymer-based therapy against HER2/neu expressing
cancer cells should make a significant clinical impact.
