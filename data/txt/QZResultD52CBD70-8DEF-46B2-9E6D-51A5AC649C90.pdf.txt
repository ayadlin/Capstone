BACKGROUND. Intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy is
effective in preventing recurrence and progression in nonmuscle-invasive bladder
cancer but the dosing schedule and duration of treatment remain empirical. The
outcome of BCG therapy was prospectively evaluated on patients according to
the number of maintenance cycles received.

METHODS. Between 1997 and 2002, 111 patients with nonmuscle-invasive bladder
cancer at high risk of recurrence and progression underwent transurethral resec-

tion followed by intravesical instillations of BCG. After an induction treatment of
6 weekly instillations, patients were scheduled to receive a 3-weekly maintenance
treatment at the 3rd, 6th, 12th, 18th, 24th, 30th, and 36th month. At each visit a
clinical assessment was obtained.
RESULTS. Over a median clinical follow-up of 31 months, 43% of patients experienced recurrence and 8.1% progressed to muscle-invasive disease or metastasis.

maintenance BCG cycles, and 41% for those who received only the induction
BCG or 1 maintenance cycle (P 5 .0003).

CONCLUSIONS. The results of this study suggest that a minimum of 3 cycles of
maintenance BCG is required to significantly reduce the recurrence rate. It also
suggests that more cycles may result in further improvements but the benefits
may be outweighed by increasing side effects in some patients. Cancer

ladder cancer represents the sixth most common cancer in Canada1 and is nonmuscle-invasive (stage pTa, pT1, or pTis) in
approximately 70% of cases.2 Nonmuscle-invasive transitional cell
carcinomas (nmTCC) recurs in up to 70% of cases within 60 months.2
Carcinoma in situ (pTis) is at higher risk of progression to muscleinvasive disease or metastasis, as more than 50% of patients treated
with transurethral resection (TUR) alone suffer progression.3
Standard treatment for high-risk nmTCC consists of TUR,
removing all visible lesions, followed by intravesical therapy. A second look resection is performed for pT1 lesions to remove any residual tumor (37% of cases) and for further staging.4 Persistence of pT1

disease is associated with a very high rate of progression to muscle-invasive disease within 5 years.5 Once

lation of bacillus Calmette-Gue
as the best treatment for high-risk nmTCC, combined
with TUR, to prevent or delay recurrences and progression and to cure Tis.2,7-11
Although its efficacy is clearly acknowledged,
BCG treatment remains largely empirical in terms of
dosing and duration. Knowing when to stop BCG or
pursue a more aggressive strategy is one of the hardest decisions facing urologists managing these highrisk patients. Persistence of T1 disease 3 to 6 months
post-BCG therapy has shown an association with an
82% chance of progression, with a median time of
8.4 months, compared with 25%, with a median time
to progression greater than 5 years, for patients with
non-T1 lesions or no disease, suggesting that these
patients require additional therapy.12 A maintenance
regimen has been proposed, adding instillations
cycles after the initial 6-instillation cycle.10 A prospective study from the Southwest Oncology Group
(SWOG) including 550 patients randomized to a
weekly BCG regimen for 6 weeks, followed or not by
3 weekly instillations at the third and sixth month
and every 6 months thereafter for up to 3 years,
added support to the use of maintenance therapy. In
patients with Tis, maintenance BCG resulted in an
improvement in 5-year disease-free survival, from
41% in the observation group to 60% in the maintenance group (P < .04).13 However, in that study only
a small percentage of patients were able to complete
the 3-year maintenance dosing schedule. This low
level of compliance makes it difficult to perform a
randomized study of the minimal number of BCG
maintenance cycles necessary for an optimal effect.
In recent years we prospectively recruited a cohort of
patients treated with maintenance BCG for high-risk
nmTCC to analyze various prognostic markers. The
present study took advantage of this cohort to evaluate the modalities of maintenance BCG.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
From 1997 to 2002, 156 patients with high-risk
nmTCC from 8 institutions in Canada, all eligible for
BCG therapy, were offered to participate in this prospective study; 131 accepted and signed an informed
consent form. Characteristics of high-risk tumors
were stage pT1, grade 3, multiplicity (>3), diffuse Tis,
more than 3 cm in size, or the presence of recurrent

711

tumors within 6 months of inclusion TUR. Previous
BCG therapy more than 1 year before inclusion
and previous use of chemotherapeutic agents like
Mitomycin C were allowed provided they were discontinued 6 months before inclusion. Previous chemotherapy for invasive bladder cancer with no residual
invasive disease was allowed provided it was discontinued 6 months before inclusion. Patients previously
treated with local radiation therapy to the pelvis for
any cancer or planning to receive concomitant chemotherapy were excluded. Fourteen were excluded
because pathologic staging showed muscle-invasive
tumors, 5 for insufficient follow-up, and 1 for protocol
violation.
At least 3 weeks after TUR, patients received the
initial 6 weekly intravesical administrations of
120 mg BCG (Pacis Shire Pharmaceuticals) in 50 mL
of physiological bacteriostatic-free saline solution.
The solution was instilled in an emptied bladder
through a catheter. Patients were instructed to try
retaining the solution for 2 hours, changing position
every 15 minutes. Maintenance therapy was given
weekly for 3 weeks, starting the week after control
cystoscopies at the 3rd, 6th, 12th, 18th, 24th, 30th,
and 36th month. In cases of moderate to severe side
effects, dosage reduction to 60 or 30 mg was allowed.
Control cystoscopies were pursued annually after the
first 3 years. At each visit clinical assessment including a questionnaire on side effects and urine cytology
was obtained. Visible recurrences or suspicious
lesions were removed by TUR. The TNM classification
was used for staging.14
Complete response was defined as normal cystoscopy and negative cytology. For Tis a biopsy was
necessary. Tumor recurrence or progression was histologically confirmed or based on the surgeon’s opinion in cases of electrofulguration or laser treatment.
To avoid any doubt as to the authenticity of recurrences, as recurrences detected at the first cystoscopy
might be tumors missed at TUR, only recurrences
detected at the second cystoscopy (sixth month) and
after were considered. The primary endpoint was
recurrence-free survival (RFS). To demonstrate a relationship between the number of BCG cycles and
RFS, the latter was not evaluated from the time of
TUR because the length of BCG treatment itself
could affect the validity of statistical tests. Premature
interruption of scheduled BCG cycles due to early recurrence might have introduced a potential bias in
the analysis, namely, the inability to determine
whether the low number of cycles resulted in recurrence or whether recurrence resulted in the low
number of cycles. Therefore, RFS was defined as the
period elapsed between the last BCG instillation and

either recurrence or the last study visit.15 The secondary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS),
defined similarly. Patients were followed past a first
recurrence to detect any progression. The association between the number of BCG cycles and the
endpoints was evaluated using survival analysis
techniques.16 Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed and compared using the log-rank test. The
hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)
according to the number of BCG cycles were computed. To facilitate clinical interpretation, survival
curves were also constructed using a standard definition of RFS after TUR. Multivariate Cox proportional
hazards models were used to adjust for potential
confounding effect of gender, age, stage, and grade.
Comparisons of baseline characteristics were done
using 1-way analysis of variance and Pearson’s chisquare test. Statistical analysis was performed using
SAS v. 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Statistical significance was determined at P < .05. All tests were 2sided.

RESULTS
Many patients from this cohort at high risk of recurrence had tumors with properties usually associated
with a bad prognosis: 42% were grade 3, 32% were
pT1, and 60% were multiple (Table 1). For analysis
purpose, and because of the limited number of
patients, the cohort was divided into 4 groups, based
on the number of BCG cycles: no maintenance, 1, 2,

and 3 or more maintenance cycles received before
the first recurrence. Disease progression, patient refusal, or severe side effects motivated ending the
treatment. Only 1 patient tolerated the complete
treatment schedule of 8 cycles (27 instillations). No
significant differences were found between groups
on any of the baseline characteristics except for age,
where patients receiving 3 or more maintenance
BCG were younger (P 5 .041).
Over a median clinical follow-up of 31 months,
48 of the 111 patients (43.2%) experienced recurrence. Thirty-seven (77.1%) of these first recurrences
were histologically confirmed. Five patients had invasive tumors, whereas 19 patients had pTa, 8 had pT1,
and 5 had pTis tumors; 6 patients had grade 1, 17
had grade 2, and 14 had grade 3 tumors. On the basis of univariate Cox proportional hazards model,
gender and number of maintenance BCG cycles were
predictors of RFS (Table 2). Women were at higher
risk of recurrence (HR 5 2.05, P 5 .028). Compared
with no maintenance, 1 maintenance BCG cycle had
no significant effect on recurrence risk, whereas 2
maintenance cycles produced a 50% decrease in recurrence risk, which did not reach statistical significance (HR 5 0.49, P 5 .14). Three or more
maintenance BCG cycles significantly reduced the recurrence risk by 80% (HR 5 0.21, P 5 .0034). Controlling for age, gender, and stage, multivariate analysis
confirmed those observations for at least 3 maintenance BCG cycles (HR 5 0.23, P 5 .0064). Further
subdivision of patients showed a risk associated with

3 maintenance cycles of 0.222 (adjusted P 5 .15) and
with four or more maintenance cycles of 0.228
(adjusted P 5 .017). However, there was no significant difference between these 2 groups (P 5 .98) and
for that reason we maintained our grouping of 3 or
more maintenance cycles. To calculate Kaplan-Meier
RFS estimates, none and 1 maintenance BCG were
grouped together. The Kaplan-Meier curves (Fig. 1)
showed a significant difference between groups in
RFS after the last BCG instillation (overall log-rank
test, P 5 .0003); however, the reduction of risk of recurrence attributed to 2 maintenance BCG failed to
reach statistical significance (P 5 .054). Twelve
months after the last BCG instillation the estimated
frequency of recurrence was of 11.5% (95% CI, 0%–
24%) for patients who received at least 3 maintenance BCG cycles, 33.3% (95% CI, 9%–57%) after 2
maintenance cycles, and 53.5% (95% CI, 40%–66%)
for patients who received 1 maintenance cycle or
only the 6 initial instillations. We also observed that
among the 31 patients who received at least 3 maintenance BCG cycles, the 4 patients who suffered recurrence received 3 (n 5 1) or 4 (n 5 3)
maintenance BCG cycles, and that no recurrence
occurred among the 12 patients who received 5
maintenance BCG cycles or more.

Recurrence rates were similar for 20 T1G3 and
non-T1G3 tumors (P 5 .48) (Table 2). Progression
was observed in 9 patients (8.1%), 8 developing muscle-invasive disease, and 1 a metastasis. Five tumor
progressions appeared at the first recurrence; 3 of
them occurring less than 7 months after TUR. The 4
other progressions occurred at 18 and 33 months
(second recurrence), 44 months (fifth recurrence),
and 49 months (fourth recurrence) after TUR. Progression was slightly more frequent among patients
who received none or 1 maintenance BCG than
among patients who received 2 maintenance BCG
cycles or more (7/64 5 10.9% vs 2/47 5 4.3%, P
5 .20). During the study period, 3 of the 9 patients

cer; 4 other patients died from other cancers and 2
from heart disease.
Noncompliance to the whole schedule of treatment was mostly related to morbidity (Table 3).
Local side effects were more frequently reported and
their frequency significantly related to the number of
BCG cycles received. Bladder irritation and burning
sensation were reported by about 20% of patients
receiving no maintenance and by more than 50% of
patients after 3 maintenance BCG cycles (Table 3).
Systemic side effects were less frequent and their frequency not significantly related to the number of
BCG cycles.

DISCUSSION
Intravesical immunotherapy with BCG has been used
for almost 30 years in the treatment of nmTCC after
TUR or to treat Tis. It is effective in delaying or preventing recurrence and progression, although its outcome is still unpredictable. Various trials have
suggested that maintenance therapy could improve
the outcome of BCG treatment but the optimal
maintenance scheme still has to be defined.9 Andius
and Holmang17 showed that multiple instillation
cycles improved RFS compared with a single 6-week
induction in 236 Ta/T1 bladder cancer patients, but
suggested that maintenance therapy may not be
necessary for pTa and lower-grade tumors. Van der
Meijden et al18 concluded that maintenance therapy
should mainly be applied to high- and intermediaterisk-tumors. Saint et al19 similarly reported that
maintenance therapy for nmTCC yielded a significant
recurrence rate reduction but adherence was hindered by adverse reactions, leading 81% of patients
to voluntary interruption. Han and Pan,11 in a metaanalysis of 25 trials (4767 patients), concluded that

Maintenance BCG in Bladder CA/Decobert et al

intravesical BCG with maintenance treatment should
be offered as the treatment of choice to patients with
papillary carcinomas.
In the present study we used a cohort of prospectively recruited patients with high-risk nmTCCs
who received various numbers of maintenance BCG
cycles to evaluate the impact of the number of BCG
cycles administered. We are well aware that this is
not a randomized study and that the number of
patients is limited. However, we believe that carrying
out a randomized study would be very difficult, for
various reasons, the most important being the low
level of compliance of patients to maintenance BCG.
Considering these limitations we nonetheless believe
that the analysis we carried out provides reliable information to help optimize maintenance BCG therapy. To increase the reliability of our analysis we
used a strict definition of recurrence, considering
only those discovered at the second cystoscopy and
later. Moreover, as detailed in Materials and Methods, RFS time was evaluated from the end of BCG
treatment to minimize the bias introduced by the
arrest of BCG therapy due to early recurrence.
Under these conditions the present study
showed that BCG maintenance therapy brought a
delayed first recurrence and a trend in lowering progression rate in high-risk nmTCCs. We showed that 2
maintenance BCG cycles was sufficient to have an
impact on RFS, whereas 3 or more led to a significant
reduction of the risk of recurrence (Fig. 1, Table 2),
with an RFS of 82.6% 3 years after the last BCG
instillation compared with only 29.0% for patients
receiving only induction BCG. Although the approximately 5-fold risk reduction brought by 3 maintenance cycles did not reach significance, we observed
no significant difference between 3 cycles and 4 or
more cycles, suggesting that 3 demonstrated a near
maximal effect. Moreover, patients who received 5
treatments or more had no recurrence. Although
these observations do not point to an optimal number of maintenance cycles to recommend, we believe
they suggest that patients should be encouraged to
tolerate at least 3 cycles of maintenance and to continue further instillations if well tolerated.
An earlier meta-analysis, regrouping results from
24 studies, demonstrated that maintenance BCG was
associated with a reduced risk of progression.9 Tumor progression was very low in our cohort (8.1%)
and could not be significantly associated with maintenance treatment, although we observed 10.9% progression among patients receiving only the induction
or 1 maintenance BCG compared with 4.3% for
patients with 2 or more maintenance BCG. Our
90.8% progression-free status at 3 years and low pro-

715

gression occurrence for T1G3 tumors (14%) may
reflect a different nature of tumors treated in general
urology practice compared with the higher progression rate observed in referral cancer centers.
Local side effects such as cystitis, hematuria, and
pollakiuria, and systemic side effects mainly related
to host reactivity against infection affect BCG-treated
patients. It was reported that side effects tend to be
less frequent during maintenance.18 However, we
observed an increase in local side effects with an
increased number of BCG treatments. Because of
early recurrence or intolerable side effects, only 1
patient received all scheduled maintenance BCG
cycles.

Conclusion
This study shows that maintenance BCG is effective
in increasing the RFS of patients with high-risk
nmTCC. However, the low percentage of patients tolerating the entire planned schedule of treatment
shows that despite its efficacy BCG should still be
administered with care. Our data also suggest that
maintenance BCG shows some efficacy even with a
reduced number of cycles, as only 2 maintenance
BCG cycles notably reduced the risk of recurrence
and 3 or more lowered the risk by approximately
80% with no significant difference between 3 cycles
and 4 or more cycles. Nonetheless, the absence of
recurrences in the small group of patients who
received 5 cycles and more suggest that patients
should be encouraged to continue the treatment
beyond 3 maintenance cycles, if well tolerated.
Although this study was not randomized, its observations could be helpful to counsel bladder cancer
patients treated with BCG.
