ABSTRACT
Lapatinib, an orally adminstered small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor
targeting epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) and Her2/Neu, has been widely
accepted in the treatment of breast cancer. In this study, we found that lapatinib
induced cytotoxicity in human hepatoma Huh7, HepG2 and HA22T cells. For the
mode of cell death, we found lapatinib induced a higher percent of dead cells and a
lower percent of hypodiploid cells, suggesting non-apoptotic cell death in lapatinibtreated hepatoma cells. Moreover, lapatinib-induced autophagy in hepatoma cells
was confirmed by the detection of autophagic LC3-II conversion, the up-regulation
of autophagy-related proteins, and the down-regulation of p62 by immunoblotting.
Autophagic cell death was demonstrated by images of punctuated LC3 patterns, a
higher percent of acridine orange positive cells, as well as a partial rescue of cell
death by autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine or chloroquine. We also found massive
vacuoles in lapatinib-treated hepatoma cells by electronic microscopy. In addition,
the shRNA of knocked-down autophagy-related proteins rescued the hepatoma
cells from lapatinib-induced growth inhibition. We also demonstrated a reduction of
tumorigenesis by lapatinib in vivo. In conclusion, lapatinib induced autophagic cell
death and the growth of human hepatoma cells. Our study provides potential cancer
therapies by using lapatinib as a treatment for hepatoma.

INTRODUCTION

to high recurrent and metastatic rates even after the use
of current treatment modalities such as surgery, transhepatic artery chemoembolzation, radiofrequency
ablation, radiotherapy, and multitarget tyrosine kinase
inhibitors[2-4]. Clearly, the development of novel
therapeutics against HCC is an urgent task.
Lapatinib is a reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(TKI) developed for targeted therapy by GlaxoSmithKline
[5-6]. Its known targets are tyrosine kinase in the
cytoplastic domain of epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR or ErbB1) and epidermal growth factor receptor-2
(ErbB2 or Her2). Due to the high incidence of EGFR/

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been
categorized as one of the five most common cancers in
the world in recent years. The incidence of HCC has
dramatically increased in Western countries and has
become more prevalent in Asian countries in the last
decades due to chronic liver disease, chronic hepatitis or
cirrhosis induced by hepatotropic viruses, aflatoxin and
alcohol consumption [1]. Even with aggressive therapy,
the 5-year survival rate of patients with advanced HCC
remains less than 10%[2]. This poor prognosis is due

Her2 signaling amplification associated with a poor
prognosis in some types of human cancers such as breast
cancer, lapatinib in combination with capecitabine has
been approved by the Food and Drug Administration
as a therapy for patients with Her2-overexpressing
or metastatic breast cancer that failed to respond to
anthracycline, taxane, or the previous targeting agent, antiErbB2 monoclonal antibody transtuzumab (Herceptin)
[5-6]. The advantages of lapatinib treatment include
the specificity of the EGFR family members, better
applicability through oral administration, and tolerability
of adverse effects with high compliance. Lapatinib is well
accepted in ongoing preclinical or clinical applications
for treatment of various solid tumors, including those
of the breast, lung, HCC, head and neck, vulva, colon,
prostate, ovarian and gastric cancers [5, 7-9]. Compared
to trastuzumab, lapatinib treatment also shows higher
activity in Her2-positive breast cancer patients with PTEN
mutations [5, 10]. Although the phase II trials for lapatinib
and HCC show a marginal benefit to a subgroup of
patients without predictive markers yet characterized [78], the role of lapatinib in the treatment of HCC remains
to be elucidated.
Many anticancer drugs work by induction of
programmed cell death in tumor cells. Apoptosis is the
first well-characterized programmed cell death. Its unique
point is cells with condensed and fragmented chromatin.
Besides apoptosis, many studies have recently focused
on anticancer-drug-induced non-apoptotic cell death,
such as autophagic cell death and necroptosis [11-12]. In
cells, autophagy was originally found to be a strategy to
accelerate material and energy recycling by the digestion
of aged organelles with autophagy-specific lysosomes,
also called autophagosomes. Some cancer cells use this
kind of autophagy to increase proliferation under stress or
in some nutrient-insufficient microenvironments [11, 13].
However, in recent years, studies found autophagosomeassociated autophagic cell death as the second type of wellstudied programmed cell death. Compared to apoptosis,
the different features of autophagic cell death include
massive autophagic vacuolization (double-membraned
vacuoles) inside the cytoplasm and the absence of
chromosome condensation and nuclear fragmentation.
Except for autophagic vacuoles, the specific features
of autophagic cell death also include beclin-1 (ATG6),
ATG5, ATG12, or ATG7 involvement and LC-I to LC-II
conversion. More papers discuss breaking the apoptosis
rules we knew a decade ago. For example, apoptotic
cascade molecules, such as FADD and caspase-8, are
also involved in autophagy, as mentioned above, since
recruitment of TNFR molecule caspase-8 and FADD with
autophagy-related proteins ATG5, ATG12, and ATG16L
were observed in the development (generation) of early
autophagosomes in certain autophagy signal pathways
[14-15].
Potential targets for anticancer therapy in HCC

include the EGFR and Her2 overexpressed in HCC and
directly implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis. Previous
investigations indicate that EGFR is actively expressed in
human HCC cells and EGF is required for the growth of
HCC cells [4, 16-17]. In addition, Her2 is expressed in a
significant number of HCCs, and may be an independent
prognostic factor [18]. In this study, we chose human HCC
cells as a model system for dissecting the mechanisms of
lapatinib-induced HCC cell death to extend the application
of lapatinib in HCC, such as that for the administration
of single therapeutic as reported in phase II clinical trials
[7-8], as well as combinatory treatment with other drugs
or radiotherapy. We found the mechanism of lapatinibinduced cytotoxicity of HCC is autophagic cell death.

RESULTS
Cytotoxicity of lapatinib in HCC cells
First, we tested lapatinib-induced cytotoxicity
in several kinds of HCC cell lines, including well
differentiated Huh7, HepG2, and poorly differentiated
HA22T-VGH (HA22T) cells. Relatively viable cells
were tested by a MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2Htetrazolium, inner salt] tetrazolium compound assay. As
shown in Fig. 1, after 3 days of lapatinib exposure, the
viability of these cells was dramatically reduced in a
dose dependent manner when compared with the relative
viability of cells treated with the same volume of vehicle
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). According to this assay,
the EC50 for growth inhibition in lapatinib-treated Huh7,
HepG2, and HA22T was about 2.11, 3.42 and 4.85 μM,
respectively. In addition, we also detected the targets of
lapatinib, EGFR and ErbB2, in these HCC cells (Fig. S1).

Induction of non-apoptotic cell death by lapatinib
in HCC cell lines
As shown in Fig. 2, lapatinib-induced more than
90% or 80% of dead (PI-positive) Huh7 or HA22T
cells (left panel), respectively; however, around or less
than 10% sub G1 (hypoploid) cells (or DNA laddering,
right panel) were detected [19-21]. We found the similar
pattern for lapatinib-treated HepG2 cells (data not shown).
We also used the Annexin V assay to detect externalized
phosphotidyl serine to confirm the apoptosis assay (data
not shown). To further elucidate lapatinib-induced cell
death, we found the involvement of mitochondria in
the lapatinib-induced death pathway due to the loss of
mitochondrial integrity in HCC cells (Fig. S2). These data
suggest mitochondria-involved non-apoptotic cell death
induction (like autophagy or necrosis) by lapatinib in HCC
cells, similar to the effect of lapatinib in K562 cells in

related proteins LC3 (LC3-II conversion), Beclin-1
(ATG6), ATG5, ATG7 and BNIP in HCC cells. Lapatinib
also decreased the expression of p62 in Huh7 and HA22T
cells. This is consistent with the degradation of p62 by
autophagy[23]. We also checked the morphology of
lapatinib-treated HCC cells by transmission electronic
microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 6, lapatinib
induced a large amount of vacuoles in drug-treated HCC
cells compared to the vehicle DMSO-treated cells. This
phenomenon is specifically evident in both Huh7 and
HepG2.
To further confirm lapatinib-induced autophagic
cell death, we tested the effects of two inhibitors,
3-methyladenine (3-MA) and chloroquine, which block
the early stages of autophagic processes with a PtdIns3K
inhibitor (3-MA) or a lysosomotropic compound for
elevating pH in lysosomes/autophagosomes (chloroquine)
[20]. Lapatinib-induced growth inhibition was effectively
blocked when HCC cells were incubated with 3-MA or
chloroquine (Fig. 7). This data suggests lapatinib induced
autophagic cell death in HCC cells.
To further test whether lapatinib induced autophagic
cell death, we explored the role of autophagic proteins,

Lapatinib-induced autophagic cell death in HCC
cells
Since we found lapatinib effective in killing HCC
cells (near 100%, Fig. 2) with less than 10% attributed
to apoptosis, we wondered if these cells could undergo
autophagy or necrosis after lapatinib treatment. We tested
whether lapatinib induced autophagic cell death in HCC
cells by the detection of autophagic vacuoles-containing
cells. As shown in Fig. 3, autolysosome formation
(acridine orange positive cells) was detected after Huh7,
HepG2 or HA22T cells were treated with lapatinib. In
addition, punctuate LC3 aggregates (the evidence of LC3
conversion) were observed after 3 kinds of HCC cells
were treated with lapatinib (Fig. 4)[22].
To further confirm lapatinib-caused autophagy in
HCC cells, we checked the expression levels of some
autophagy-related proteins in lapatinib-treated cells
by immunoblotting [20]. As shown in Fig. 5, lapatinib
induced LC3-II conversion, an increase of the autophagy-

such as ATG5, ATG7 and Beclin-1. In the vehicle- or
lapatinib-treated cells, we knocked down expression
of these autophagy-related proteins (Fig. S3) after
transduction with a short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
expression lentivirus system [21]. As shown in Fig. 8, the
specific knockdown of ATG5, ATG7, and Beclin-1 mRNA,
but not the non-targeting red fluorescent protein (RFP)
mRNA, rescued the cells from lapatinib-mediated cell
death. These data indicate, consistent with our previous
figures, the involvement of these autophagic proteins with
lapatinib-induced autophagic cell death in HCC cells.

We used a xenograft system to inoculate human HepG2
cells into nude mice. As shown in Fig. 9, after being orally
administered 100 or 200 mg/kg lapatinib for 3 weeks,
lapatinib effectively reduced the tumor volumes in a dose
dependent manner compared to the vehicle administration
while lapatinib did not dramatically affect body weight
and numbers of white blood cells in these mice (data not
shown). This demonstrates a reduction of tumorigenesis
by lapatinib in vivo.

In this study, we clarified the mode of cell death and
the mechanism of action of lapatinib against human HCC
cells[24]. It could be regarded as translational information

regimens or radiotherapy for HCC.
The evidence of lapatinib-induced autophagic cell
death includes a massive amount of dead cells with a

DISCUSSION

Since we have demonstrated the cytotoxicity effect
of lapatinib in hepatoma cells, we wondered whether
lapatinib treatment reduces HCC tumor growth in vivo.

percentage of growth inhibition was calculated as described in Fig. 1.

limited amount of apoptotic cells (Fig. 2) [19-21]; the loss
of mitochondrial integrity (Fig. S2)[25]; the detection of
punctuate LC3 aggregates (Fig. 4) and acridine orange
positive cells (Fig. 3)[22, 26]; the decreased expression
of p62 and the elevated expression of autophagy-related
proteins such as LC3, ATG5, ATG7, Beclin-1, and BNIP
(Fig. 5); and the observation of massive vacuoles by TEM
(Fig. 6) [11, 20, 27]. We also confirmed autophagic cell
death by effectively reducing growth inhibition with
both autophagy inhibitor 3-MA and lysosomal inhibitor
chloroquine (Fig. 7) and by the expression of shRNA
against autophagy-related proteins ATG5, ATG7 and
Beclin-1 (Fig. 8)[11, 20-21, 27]. Most of all, we found a
significant reduction of tumor growth in a dose-dependent
manner in vivo after oral administration of lapatinib in a
human HCC xenograft system (Fig. 9). We also found
elevated E-cadherin expression in lapatinib-treated Huh7
HCC cells (Fig. S4), implicating the potential of lapatinib
against the metastasis of HCC. This point will be further
studied in the future.
According to our previous study, tumor cells are
relatively sensitive to lapatinib as compared to normal
counterparts like human CD14+ monocytes or mouse
bone-marrow cells [21]. For attached cells, we also found
lapatinib easily kills E1A/Ras transformated[28-29],
but not its normal diploid counterpart, wild-type mouse
embryonic fibroblasts with the same genetic background
(data not shown). This correlates with the safety advantage
for the administration of lapatinib to patients.
Although there are some reports about apoptotic
cell death in lapatinib-treated cancer cells, autophagic
cell death has also been induced in lapatinib-treated
leukemia, HCT116 colon and bladder cancer cells[21, 3031] and breast cancer cells co-treated with lapatinib and
obatoclaxs[10], similar to our present study. Autophagic
cell death is also induced by many other stimuli, such as
platonin-treated leukemia cells[26], TNFα-treated cells,
and death receptor-mediated cell death in cells lacking

FADD, caspase activation, or NF-κB activation[15, 3233].
Although unlike the obvious overexpression of
ErbB2 in about 30% of breast or lung cancer patients[5],
there are still accumulated studies demonstrating
mutations or aberrant expressions of EGFR superfamily
members in HCC, such as ErbB2 overexpression or
truncated ErbB2 in a certain population of HCC patients
[16-18, 34]. According to our data, we detected similar
expression levels of EGFR and ErbB2 in our HCC cells
(Fig. S1) as compared to A549 lung adenocarcinoma
cells, which belong to cells expressing low levels of
these receptors [9]. Since those human tumor cell lines
with EGFR/ErbB2-overexpressing are more sensitive to
lapatinib cytotoxicity, according to our study, lapatinib
blocks growth signals mediated by either important EGFR/
ErbB2 signaling through moderate amounts of EGFR
and ErbB2 receptors or unveiled targets associated with
HCC proliferation. Moreover, although HepG2 cells have
lower EGFR and Her2 expression (Fig. S1), their lapatinib
sensitivity is similar to Huh7 and HA22T (Fig. 1). Further
work includes exploring the correlations between lapatinib
and the mutations or amplifications of EGFR/ErbB2 and
their downstream signaling in HCC cell proliferation
[34]. This may further clarify the roles of EGFR/ErbB2
signaling in the development of HCC.
HCC cells were reported autophagy-defective with
impaired autophagy responses[35]. Therefore, induction
of autophagy or autophagic cell death might have a role in
enhancing treatment responses for HCC.
Our study demonstrates lapatinib-induced
cytotoxicity of HCC through the mechanisms of
autophagic cell death. To extend the clinical application of
lapatinib against HCC, our results could be a reference and
translational information for the design of combinatory
treatments with other regimens or radiotherapy. From
point view of drug re-positioning by using lapatinib,
the strategy about combination of lapatinib and other

treatments or radiotherapy against hepatoma will be tested
in the future.

After lapatinib treatment, HCC cells were collected
and resuspended in a lysis buffer (Sigma) with protease
inhibitors (Roche Biochemicals). Cell lysates with
30 or 50 μg of protein were subjected to 12% sodium
dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide
gel
(SDS-PAGE)
electrophoresis. For immunoblotting, the following
antibodies were used: actin (Sigma), ATG5 (Cell
Signaling), ATG7 (Santa Cruz Biochemicals), Beclin-1
(or ATG6, Cell Signaling), LC3 (or ATG8, Abgent), and
nucleoporin p62 (Genetax).

METHODS
Tissue culture and agent treatments
Human hepatoma Huh-7, HepG2 and HA22T cells
were cultured in Dulbeco’s modified Eagles’ medium
(Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum
(Hyclone), 100 IU/ml of penicillin (Gibco), 100 mg/ml
of streptomycin (Gibco), and 1% nonessential amino acid
(Gibco). One thousand-fold stock solution of lapatinib
was prepared by dissolving a ground lapatinib tablet
(GlaxoSmithKline) in DMSO (Sigma). For lapatinib and
3-MA (Sigma) or chloroquine co-treatment experiments,
20-mM of 3-MA or 500-fold chloroquine stock solution
was prepared by dissolving both drugs in a culture
medium.

Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM)
After treatment, HCC cells were collected from
culture dishes using a PBS washing buffer and a TrypsinEDTA detaching buffer. According to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Electron Microscopy Science), cells were
fixed by 2.5% glutaraldehyde-containing cacodylate
buffer (pH 7.4), stained with 1% osmium tetroxide, and
then embedded in Spurr’s resin after dehydration. The
morphology of cells was then observed by TEM.

Growth inhibition analysis
After drug treatments, the viability of the cells was
measured using the MTS assay (Promega), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The optical density (OD)
value of DMSO-vehicle treated cells was calculated as
100% viability.

Gene knockdown by shRNA expression system
As described previously [21], a lentivirus-based
shRNA expression system from the RNAi Consortium
(TRC) was used to knockdown the expression of the
following genes: ATG5, ATG7, Beclin-1 and RFP (as
non-targeting shRNA control). These pLKO.1-shRNA
constructions were from the National RNAi Core Facility,
Academia Sinica, Taiwan[21]. We used 2 different
shRNA constructs (#1 and #2, as indicated in Figs. 8
and S3) for ATG7 and Beclin-1 (TRCN0000007584,
TRCN0000007587,
TRCN0000033549
and
TRCN0000033552,
respectively)[21].
Lentiviral
production, viral infection and puromycin selection were
performed as per TRC’s instructions. Finally, cells were
treated with lapatinib, and viability was tested by the MTS
assay as described above.

Flow cytometry
For simultaneous detection of both dead cells and
apoptotic cells by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton
Dickenson), HCC cells with intact plasma membranes
(live cells) or with DNA laddering (hypodiploid or sub
G1 phase) were detected by cell-cycle detection assay as
previously described[20-21]. After treatment, all floating
and attaching HCC cells were collected, split into 2
tubes, and resuspended in 1 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI,
Sigma) containing either phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
or hypotonic buffer (0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton
X-100, and 5 μg/ml PI). The former was used to detect the
percentage of total dead cells (PI-positive cells) without
intact plasma membranes, while the latter was used to
detect apoptotic (hypodiploid) cells [20-21]. To detect
the percent of acridine orange positive cells, cells were
collected, stained with 10 μg/ml acridine orange, and then
analyzed by flow cytometry. All data measured by flow
cytometry were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree
Star).

In vivo human tumor xenograft system
Nude mice experiments were done in the animal
colonies of Mackay Memorial Hospital after approval by
the Institutional Animal Experimentation Committee of
the hospital. Human HepG2 cells that stably expressed
luciferase were first enriched after transfection and
puromycin selection. As described previously[36], after
inoculation of HepG2 luciferase stably expressed cells (106
in 0.1 ml PBS) into the right hind limbs of Balc/c nude
mice for 3 weeks, 12 mice with similar tumor volumes
were selected and randomly divided into 3 groups.

They were then orally administered a vehicle (0.5%
hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose with 0.1% Tween-80), or
100 or 200 mg/kg lapatinib in vehicle every day for the
next 3 weeks (days 0-22). Tumor volumes were monitored
every 2 days in vivo by detection of the luciferase activity
of cells with Xenogeny IVIS 200 Imaging System
(PerkinElmer). The mice were left untreated for days
23-42. After sacrificing at day 42, tumor volumes inside
the mice were double-checked with weight and caliper
measurements.
