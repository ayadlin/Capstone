BACKGROUND: In late reproductive-aged breast cancer survivors, there is a need for real-time biomarkers of postchemotherapy ovarian function. The objective was to determine whether antimullerian hormone (AMH) and inhibin B
are such biomarkers. The authors tested whether AMH and inhibin B were impacted by breast cancer treatment by
comparing cancer survivors to age-matched control women and determined the association between these hormones and postchemotherapy menstrual pattern. METHODS: Breast cancer patients (n ¼ 127) with American Joint
Committee on Cancer stage I to III disease who were premenopausal at diagnosis were enrolled postchemotherapy
and observed. The primary endpoint was chemotherapy-related amenorrhea (CRA) (12 months of amenorrhea after
chemotherapy). Matched pair analyses compared AMH, inhibin B, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels
between cancer and age-matched control subjects. Associations between hormones, CRA status, and change in CRA
status over time were assessed. RESULTS: The median age of the patients at chemotherapy was 43.2 years (range,
26.7-57.8 years). At enrollment, median follow-up since chemotherapy was 2.1 years, and 55% of subjects had CRA.
Compared with age-matched controls, cancer subjects had significantly lower AMH (P ¼ .004) and inhibin B (P <
.001) and higher FSH (P < .001). AMH (P ¼ .002) and inhibin B (P ¼ .001) were found to be significantly associated
with risk of CRA, even after controlling for FSH. AMH was significantly lower (P ¼ .03) and FSH was significantly
higher (P ¼ .04) in menstruating subjects who developed subsequent CRA. CONCLUSIONS: AMH and inhibin B are 2
additional measures of postchemotherapy ovarian function in late reproductive-aged breast cancer survivors. With
further research and validation, these hormones may supplement limited current tools for assessing and predicting

More than 2 million American women are breast cancer survivors.1 At diagnosis, approximately one-third are younger

than 54 years old, and 10% are aged 35 to 45 years.2 Most breast cancer patients will receive gonadotoxic chemotherapy,
commonly including cyclophosphamide.3 Gonadotoxic chemotherapy accelerates natural ovarian aging, leading to shortened reproductive life and early menopause.4-6 Assessing postchemotherapy ovarian function in breast cancer survivors of
late reproductive age is important to clinical decision making on a range of issues such as choice of adjuvant endocrine therapy, surgical oophorectomy, and prevention/treatment of menopause-related symptoms. Currently, the primary tool and
gold standard for assessing postchemotherapy ovarian function is menstrual pattern. However, determining ovarian function by menstrual pattern requires watchful waiting by patients and physicians. The diagnosis of chemotherapy-related
amenorrhea (CRA) is made retrospectively after prolonged postchemotherapy amenorrhea has occurred. Furthermore, in
this population, lack of menses does not always represent ovarian failure, requiring patients to use contraception and risk

misclassification for adjuvant endocrine therapy.7 Therefore, there is a significant need for reliable, real-time biomarkers of ovarian function.
Antimullerian hormone (AMH) and inhibin B are
hormone measures of ovarian function with limited data
in the breast cancer population.8-10 In adult survivors of
childhood cancers, these hormones are putative biomarkers of ovarian function that demonstrate decreased
ovarian reserve in a population in which most survivors
continue to have regular menses.11-13 It is difficult to generalize these data to breast cancer survivors, who are older
at diagnosis and exposed to different treatment regimens,
and in whom these biomarkers may be useful beyond prediction of fertility. In the breast cancer population, most
data on hormone measures of ovarian function report on
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which rises with
decreased ovarian function.14 Available data regarding
AMH and inhibin B are limited by small sample size or
short follow-up, mostly confined to the perichemotherapy
period.8-10 There is a clear shortage of data on AMH and
inhibin B as potential measures of ovarian function in late
reproductive-aged breast cancer survivors who are beyond
the immediate perichemotherapy period.
We performed a cohort study to examine AMH,
inhibin B, and FSH in postchemotherapy breast cancer
survivors with significant follow-up since chemotherapy.
Our first objective was to determine the impact of breast
cancer treatment on hormones by comparing cancer survivors to age-matched control women. We hypothesized
that we would be able to detect differences in AMH and
inhibin B between late reproductive-aged breast cancer
survivors and age-matched controls. Our second objective
was to determine the association between hormones and
CRA in the cancer survivors. Finally, we sought to examine whether hormones can predict subsequent menstrual
pattern in the cancer survivors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
We studied a cohort of 127 female, postchemotherapy
breast cancer survivors from the Rena Rowan Breast Center of the University of Pennsylvania. Eligibility criteria
included American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I to
III breast cancer, premenopausal status at cancer diagnosis
(menstrual periods in the year before chemotherapy), subsequent treatment with cyclophosphamide-based adjuvant chemotherapy, the presence of a uterus and at least 1
ovary, and initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy 1 to 4

years before enrollment. We selected this recruitment
window to obtain adequate follow-up time for events
(CRA) to occur. Hormonal therapy for breast cancer was
not an exclusion criterion.
We matched breast cancer subjects to normal controls from the Penn Ovarian Aging Study, an ongoing
study of late reproductive aging, by age and race.15 Penn
Ovarian Aging Study subjects have provided demographics, medical history, exposures, menstrual history,
body mass index (BMI), and blood samples annually since
1995. All participants provided written consent. This
study was approved by the University of Pennsylvania
Institutional Review Board.

Data Collection
For breast cancer subjects, menstrual pattern data were
collected at 3 time points: before chemotherapy, at enrollment (Assessment 1, 1-4 years after chemotherapy), and
at a second follow-up (Assessment 2, 2-7 years after chemotherapy). At Assessment 1, breast cancer subjects underwent a blood draw timed with oncology follow-up, and
therefore, not specific to menstrual cycle day. Sera were
extracted and frozen at 80 C. Clinical data were
abstracted from medical charts. For each control, we
extracted menstrual pattern data and assayed stored, early
follicular phase blood age-matched to the Assessment 1
age of her breast cancer counterpart.

Hormone Measures
Assessment 1 sera were assayed for AMH, inhibin B,
FSH, and estradiol. Assays were conducted at the Penn
Clinical and Translational Research Center. Hormone
assays were performed in duplicate; duplicate means were
analyzed. AMH was assayed using AMH enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Diagnostic Systems,
Webster, Tex). The lower limit of detection for AMH was
25 pg/mL (SI conversion: 1 ng/mL ¼ 7.14 pmol/L), and
the intra-assay coefficient of variation was 2%. Dimeric
inhibin B was assayed using inhibin B ELISA kits (Diagnostic Systems). The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 7.9% and 8.4%, respectively. The
lower limit of detection was 5 pg/mL. Estradiol and FSH
were measured by radioimmunoassay using Coat-ACount commercial kits (Diagnostic Products, Los
Angeles, Calif). The intra- and interassay coefficients of
variation were <5%. Values below detection thresholds
were given half of the threshold value in analyses.

Data Analysis
STATA (Release 9, College Station, Tex) software was used
for analyses. Summary statistics were performed for all variables. Hormone measures were transformed to natural log
values to minimize the impact of skewed distributions.
For the first objective, we compared hormone, menstrual pattern, and demographic data between breast cancer subjects and age-matched controls using the Student
t test for paired data (normally distributed data), signedrank test (non-normally distributed data), and McNemar
test (categoric data), as appropriate. Hormone and menstrual data were obtained at Assessment 1 in breast cancer
subjects and compared with matched data from controls.
Conditional logistic regression models compared cancer
to control subjects while adjusting for confounders.
Second, we determined the association between
Assessment 1 hormone measures and CRA status in breast
cancer subjects. CRA was determined by menstrual history and defined as 12 months of amenorrhea occurring
after start of chemotherapy. Categoric variables were compared using chi-square or exact methods, whereas continuous variables were compared using the Student t test
(normally distributed data) or Wilcoxon rank sum test
(ordinal or non-normally distributed variables). Poisson
regression methods were used to model the cumulative
incidence of CRA and its association with hormone levels
while adjusting for confounding. Variables with P  .1
based on the Wald test for univariate associations were
included in multivariate models.
Finally, we examined the association between Assessment 1 hormones and change in CRA status between Assessments 1 and 2 in breast cancer subjects using the Student t
test. Assessment 2 CRA status was categorized as ‘‘no change
from Assessment 1 CRA status,’’ ‘‘CRA reversal,’’ or ‘‘CRA
progression.’’ CRA reversal was defined as resumption of
menses between Assessments 1 and 2 in subjects with CRA
at Assessment 1. CRA reversal was defined as resumption of
menses between Assessments 1 and 2 in subjects with CRA
at Assessment 1. CRA progression was defined as experiencing at least 12 months of amenorrhea between Assessments 1
and 2 in subjects who did not have CRA at Assessment 1. As
secondary analyses, we determined the impact of tamoxifen
on AMH, inhibin B, and FSH levels using Student t test. All
statistical tests were 2-sided, and P values of .05 were considered to be statistically significant.
Prestudy power calculations were based on Penn
Ovarian Aging Study AMH data from normal women of
late reproductive age, with a mean  standard deviation
(SD) AMH level of 0.65 (1.06) ng/mL.16 With a 5%

594

alpha error, the study had 80% power to detect a difference in mean AMH levels of 0.38 ng/mL between breast
cancer subjects and age-matched controls.

RESULTS
A total of 127 postchemotherapy breast cancer survivors
were enrolled between 2004 and 2005 (Assessment 1).
Assessment 2 was conducted between 2007 and 2008.
Cohort characteristics (Table 1) included a median age at
start of chemotherapy of 43.2 years (range, 26.7-57.8
years). At Assessment 1, the median time since chemotherapy was 2.1 years (range, 1.0-4.9 years). Overall, participants were observed for a median of 5.2 years since
chemotherapy (range, 1.0-7.6 years). No subject was taking
hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy.
Comparison of Hormones Between Cancer
and Control Subjects
A total of 110 cancer subjects were age-matched and racematched with controls. Breast cancer subjects had significantly lower AMH and inhibin B and higher FSH than
age-matched controls in pairwise comparisons (Table 2).
Cancer status continued to be associated with significantly
lower AMH (P ¼ .01) and inhibin B (P ¼ .001) and
higher FSH (P < .001) in regression models adjusting for
confounders including gravidity, BMI, smoking, and
alcohol exposure (Table 3).
Associations Between Hormones
and CRA at Assessment 1
Cumulative CRA incidence at Assessment 1 was 55% (70
of 127 subjects). Subjects with CRA had significantly
lower AMH and inhibin B and higher FSH compared
with women without CRA (Table 4). Univariate comparisons also demonstrated that subjects with CRA were significantly older at chemotherapy than subjects without
CRA. A multivariate regression model was developed to
examine the relation between CRA and all 3 hormones
simultaneously, while controlling for age at chemotherapy, chemotherapy schedule, taxane exposure, and tamoxifen exposure. This model demonstrated that each
hormone remains independently associated with CRA
risk in the setting of adjusting for the other 2 hormones
and clinical confounders (Table 5).

Assessment 2, 2 were deceased, 1 declined follow-up, and

Assessment 2 cohort remained unchanged from Assessment 1 (Table 1).
Return of menses, or CRA reversal, occurred in 9
(13%) subjects who had CRA at Assessment 1 and
completed Assessment 2. By clinical factors, women with
CRA reversal were younger (mean age 41.7 years [range,
38.4-44.8 years] vs 47.3 years [range, 40.3-56 years];

DISCUSSION
We examined 3 hormone measures of ovarian function in
breast cancer survivors of late reproductive age. In addition to FSH, we demonstrated significant differences in
AMH and inhibin B between breast cancer survivors and
normal controls, and between breast cancer survivors with
CRA compared with breast cancer survivors who contin-

ued to menstruate. Although our numbers are limited, the
results of the current study suggest that decreased AMH
and increased FSH precede development of CRA and that
there is no association between hormone measures and
subsequent resumption of menses. Taken together, these
hormones appear to be biomarkers measuring ovarian
aging after gonadotoxic chemotherapy exposure in late
reproductive-aged women with breast cancer.
Compared with age-matched controls, this cohort
of late reproductive-aged cancer survivors had lower
AMH and inhibin B levels, as hypothesized, and higher
FSH levels. Lower AMH and inhibin B levels (secreted by

from the pituitary) and reflect the decrease in ovarian
function as a result of exposure to gonadotoxic chemotherapy. The results suggest that 2 markers in addition to
FSH are able to measure ovarian function after gonadotoxic chemotherapy in late reproductive-aged breast cancer survivors.
As hypothesized, all 3 reproductive hormone levels
in survivors with CRA reflected decreased ovarian function compared with survivors who continued menstruating. In addition, our small subset of subjects who
developed subsequent CRA suggest that lower levels of
AMH and higher levels of FSH precede CRA. Whereas
higher FSH levels in amenorrheic survivors are known,

With lengthy follow-up, the results of the current study
are generalizable to the large survivor population that is
not immediately postchemotherapy. Moreover, long follow-up enabled the study to capture menstrual pattern
changes over time and decreased misclassification by menstrual status.
Finally, the results of the current study demonstrated that AMH and inhibin B levels were not affected
by concurrent tamoxifen use. As expected, AMH levels
did not differ by tamoxifen exposure, because AMH secretion is gonadotropin-independent, and levels are stable
between and throughout menstrual cycles.21 FSH was
lower in subjects on tamoxifen, which is consistent with
the literature.22,23 Because FSH levels may be artificially
lowered by tamoxifen, FSH is less reliable in women on
tamoxifen. With replication, these are potential advantages of AMH and inhibin over FSH.
There are several reasons to identify additional biomarkers to FSH for measuring ovarian function in late
reproductive-aged breast cancer survivors. In addition to
the potential advantage of interpreting AMH and inhibin
B over FSH in the setting of tamoxifen use, all 3 of these
biomarkers have been useful in delineating specific stages
in the natural transition to menopause.15,24-28 Changes in
AMH and inhibin B appear to occur earlier than FSH in
the natural menopausal transition, appear to reflect subtle
changes in ovarian reserve compared with FSH, and may
predict time to final menstrual period better than
FSH.27,29-32 They may play a similar role in the transition
to menopause for breast cancer patients, a hypothesis that
warrants future investigation. Finally, AMH and inhibin
B may capture additional information regarding ovarian
function independent of FSH, as both AMH and inhibin
B had independent associations with CRA after controlling for FSH in this dataset.
Several limitations should be considered. First, hormone levels were obtained postchemotherapy for the purpose of evaluating postchemotherapy ovarian function.
Therefore, these results do not apply to using these hormones prechemotherapy to predict postchemotherapy
function. A second limitation was that hormone levels
were drawn timed to oncology follow-up visits. Therefore,
hormone levels were drawn throughout the menstrual
cycle, rather than in the early follicular phase, for the 52
menstruating cancer subjects. This limitation affects the
precision of FSH and inhibin B levels in menstruating
cancer subjects, but would not affect gonadotropin-inde-

598

pendent AMH. Importantly, we do not believe that this
limitation systematically biased our results for FSH and
inhibin B. Because within the menstrual cycle hormone
levels can be higher or lower than the early follicular phase
levels of these hormones,33 the result of non–cycle-specific
blood samples would be increased variability, which
would bias our results toward the null. Therefore, the
strong, statistically significant difference in FSH and
inhibin B between cancer and control subjects is likely real
and not from differential bias. Third, we recognize that tamoxifen may independently impact FSH and menstrual
pattern,23 but we did not restrict our analyses to subjects
who are not receiving endocrine therapy. Instead, our
approach was to control for tamoxifen exposure, after
which we continued to demonstrate significant associations between CRA and all 3 hormones. Furthermore, in
including both subjects on and off of tamoxifen, we present more generalizable data, as most women with breast
cancer are hormone receptor positive.34 Finally, Assessment 1 hormone levels varied in length of time from
chemotherapy for each cancer survivor. Therefore, we are
not powered to provide hormone and menstrual data at
defined intervals (eg, 1- or 2-year intervals) from
chemotherapy.
In conclusion, the results of the current study demonstrate AMH and inhibin B to be 2 additional measures
of postchemotherapy ovarian function in late reproductive-aged breast cancer survivors. With further research
and validation, these hormone biomarkers supplement
limited current tools for assessing and predicting postchemotherapy ovarian function.
