Abstract
For pediatric cancers like neuroblastoma, the most common
extracranial solid tumor of infancy, p53 mutations are rare at
diagnosis, but may be acquired after chemotherapy, suggesting a potential role in drug resistance. Heavy metal–selected
neuroblastoma cells were found to acquire an unusually broad
multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype but displayed no
alterations in genes associated with ‘‘classic’’ MDR. These
cells had acquired a mutant p53 gene, linking p53 to drug
sensitivity in neuroblastoma. We therefore generated p53deficient variants in neuroblastoma cell lines with wild-type
p53 by transduction of p53-suppressive constructs encoding
either short hairpin RNA or a dominant-negative p53 mutant.
Analysis of these cells indicated that (a) in contrast to
previous reports, wild-type p53 was fully functional in all
neuroblastoma lines tested; (b) inactivation of p53 in
neuroblastoma cells resulted in establishment of a MDR
phenotype; (c) p53-dependent senescence, the primary response of some neuroblastoma cells to DNA damage, is
replaced after p53 inactivation by mitotic catastrophe and
subsequent apoptosis; (d) knockdown of mutant p53 did not
revert the MDR phenotype, suggesting it is determined by p53
inactivation rather than gain of mutant function. These results
suggest the importance of p53 status as a prognostic marker of
treatment response in neuroblastoma. p53 suppression may
have opposite effects on drug sensitivity as determined by
analysis of isogenic pairs of tumor cell lines of nonneuroblastoma origin, indicating the importance of tissue context
for p53-mediated modulation of tumor cell sensitivity to
treatment. [Cancer Res 2007;67(21):10351–60]

Introduction
The p53 tumor-suppressor pathway is the major cancerpreventive mechanism in mammals. Germ line mutations in p53
are associated with high cancer incidence in mice and men (1). p53
is mutated in f50% of human malignancies and is functionally
inactivated in the majority of cancers that retain wild-type p53
gene due to overexpression of natural negative regulators of p53 of
cellular (Hdm2 or Hdmx) or viral origin [E6 of human papillomavirus (HPV); refs. 2–4]. Restoration of p53 function results in
toxicity in a majority of tumor cells, thus making it a prospective
approach to cancer treatment. Loss of p53 provides tumor cells
with a series of important selective advantages, including high

tolerance to growth arrest– and death-inducing stimuli and
genomic instability that promotes tumor progression by rapid
acquisition of mutations (5).
In early studies, wild-type p53 was defined as a treatment
sensitivity factor promoting apoptotic cell death of tumor cells
under conditions of chemotherapy or radiotherapy (6). However, in
later studies, it became clear that during progression tumors can
acquire numerous mechanisms for suppressing apoptosis and that
tumor response to treatment involves other mechanisms of death
such as induction of senescence or mitotic catastrophe (7–9). In
this latter case, p53-mediated growth arrest may lead to a rescuing
effect under conditions of genotoxic stress, thereby preventing cells
from prematurely entering a deadly mitosis. This dual role of p53 in
treatment sensitivity has also been shown in normal tissues, where
it may be either a strong proapoptotic factor or a survival factor in
determining radiosensitivity of cells (10).
Drug resistance acquired in the course of therapy is the main
obstacle to the successful treatment of many cancers, including
childhood neuroblastoma, the most common extracranial solid
tumor of childhood (11). A strong initial response is frequently
followed by the appearance of multidrug resistant (MDR) variants.
Although we have previously shown that the multidrug transporter
MDR-associated protein 1 (MRP1) has an important role in this
childhood malignancy (12, 13), another lesion acquired by drugresistant neuroblastoma cells is mutant p53, suggesting the
involvement of wild-type p53 in drug response (14). However,
previous investigations in this area have been limited either to
correlative studies or to modeling by using methods of p53
inhibition not reported in neuroblastomas (e.g., E6 of HPV).
Moreover, this conclusion of p53 involvement in neuroblastoma
conflicts with a number of studies showing a lack of activity of p53
in this disease due to its cytoplasmic sequestration (15–17).
We have addressed the role of p53 in determining drug response of
neuroblastoma cells by studying an unusually broad MDR phenotype of neuroblastoma cells (IMR/KAT100) selected for resistance to
potassium antimony tartrate (KAT). Our results show that p53 acts
as a drug sensitivity gene in some neuroblastoma cells by causing
them to enter irreversible growth arrest (senescence), which is
replaced by aberrant mitosis (mitotic catastrophe) and subsequent
apoptosis in p53-deficient variants. This type of p53-dependent
response to genotoxic stress is not universal to cancer cells and
differs greatly among tumor cell lines of different tissue origin.

in DMEM. Cytotoxic drugs were purchased from manufacturers as follows:
vincristine, etoposide (VP-16), and melphalan from Sigma; cisplatin,
doxorubicin, and daunorubicin from Pharmacia & Upjohn; potassium
antimony tartrate trihydrate from TJ Baker; teniposide (VM26) from BristolMyers Squibb Australia; Taxol from Calbiochem; mafosfamide from ASTA
MEDICA; methotrexate from David Bull Laboratories; geneticin (G418) from
Life Technology; Alamar blue reagent from Astral Scientific; verapamil from
Sigma Aldrich; Lipofectamine 2000 from Invitrogen Life Technologies;
puromycin, polybrene, crystal violet, and methylene blue from SigmaAldrich.
The following monoclonal antibodies were used: anti-human p53 (DO-1,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-human p21 (clone SX118, PharMingen),
anti-human MRP1 (Alexis Biochemicals), anti-human P-glycoprotein (clone
C219, DAKO Corporation), anti-actin (Sigma-Aldrich), and anti–glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; clone 6C5, Abcam Ltd.).
Polyclonal anti-human Bax antibody is from BD PharMingen.
Short-term cytotoxicity assays and clonogenic assay. Response of
cells to chemotherapeutic drugs was determined using either a 72-h Alamar
blue assay or a 24-h methylene blue assay as previously described (18, 19).
For clonogenicity assay, cells were seeded at 100 per well in six-well plates
and treated with increasing concentrations of cisplatin (24 h), doxorubicin,
vincristine, and VM26 (72 h), respectively, then cultured in drug-free
medium for 8 to 10 days until colonies formed to reasonable size. Cells were
fixed with methanol and stained with crystal violet (0.5% crystal violet in
water with 50% methanol). Colonies containing >50 cells were counted.
Plating efficiency was defined as the number of colonies observed from the
untreated cells divided by the number of cells plated. Surviving fraction was
determined by dividing the colonies counted by the number of cells seeded
with a correction for plating efficiency.
Reverse transcription-PCR analysis. The semiquantitative reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) protocols involving coamplification of the
target gene sequence and a control gene sequence (b2-microglobulin) in
the same reaction have been described previously (12, 20). The genespecific primers used for MDR1, MRP1, and h2-microglobulin have been
described previously (12). The other primers used were as follows. MRP2
( forward 5¶-ACCAATCCAAGCCTCTACCTAG-3¶, reverse 5¶-GAAAGTGCCACAGAGTATCGAG-3¶), MRP3 ( forward 5¶-GCTTTCTCTCCCGCCTGTT-3¶,
reverse 5¶-TTTAGGGACCAGAGGTCCTTCTC-3¶), GST-k ( forward 5¶GGACCTCCGCTGCAAATAC-3¶, reverse 5¶-GAAGGTCTTGCCTCCCTGG-3¶),
gGCS ( forward 5¶-CTACGGAGGAACAATGTCCGA-3¶, reverse 5¶-CCCAGGACAGCCTAATCTGG-3¶), and metallothionein ( forward 5¶-CYGGTGDCTCCTGCACCTG-3¶, reverse 5¶-CCCCTTTGCAGAYRCAGYC-3¶).
Microarray analysis. Total cytoplasmic RNA was extracted from IMR-32
and IMR/KAT100 cells using RNA extraction kit RNeasy (Qiagen). cDNA
microarrays containing 4,000 genes on glass slides were done by Peter
MacCallum Cancer Institute (Melbourne, Australia). In a first experiment,
RNA isolated from IMR-32 cells served as the reference cDNA for IMR/
KAT100 cells, with an aim to identify genetic changes due to drug selection
that conferred MDR in IMR/KAT cells. In a second experiment, IMR-32 and
IMR/KAT100 cells were treated with 2, 20, and 200 Amol/L VP-16 or with 1
and 5 Gy g-irradiation separately. cDNA from treated cells and untreated
control cells were competitively hybridized to the reference cDNA on the
microarray slides. The responses of the IMR-32 parental cells and IMR/KAT
cells to the treatments were compared to identify candidate genes that were
responsible for the MDR in IMR/KAT100 cells. Microarray data were
analyzed using GeneSpring software (version 4.1.5, Silicon Genetics).
p53 gene sequencing. The entire p53 coding region (exons 2–11) was
amplified by PCR using Human p53 Amplimer Panels (Clontech
Laboratories, Inc.). The PCR products were gel purified and sequenced
in both directions using automated fluorescence-based cycle sequencing
with BigDye terminators (PE Biosystems). p53 sequences were compared
with the wild-type sequence deposited in Genbank (accession nos. X54156
and U94788) using AssemblyLIGN computer software (Oxford Molecular
Group).
Construction of mutant p53 expression vectors and transfection.
Site-directed mutagenesis was done to generate vectors expressing p53
protein with a codon 135 mutation (M135), using the GeneEditor in vitro

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (21). November 1, 2007

Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A mutagenic oligonucleotide (5¶-AAGATGTTTTTCCAACTGGC-3¶) was designed for generating the p53 codon 135 mutation in
the pCMV-Neo vector containing wild-type p53 cDNA sequence, which was
kindly provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein (John Hopkins University, Baltimore,
MD). The presence of p53 M135 mutation in the resultant plasmid was
determined by sequencing the full-length p53 cDNA. Human neuroblastoma
SH-EP cells were transfected with the mutant p53 constructs and pCMVNeo vector-only, respectively, using calcium phosphate transfection
methods (21). Cells were selected with geneticin (G418) and single clones
were analyzed by Western blot for expression of mutant p53 protein.
Retroviral transductions. Two retroviral constructs were used to
inactivate p53 in transduced cells: one is modified pBabe vector containing
p53 short hairpin RNA (shRNA), the other one is pLXSP vector containing
dominant-negative p53 mutant encoding truncated protein corresponding
to COOH-terminal fragment of p53 (GSE56), both of which specifically
abrogate wild-type p53 function (22). We generated stable p53-deficient
variants from a panel of p53 wild-type tumor cell lines of neuroblastoma
(IMR-32, SK-N-SH, SH-EP, and SH-SY5Y) and nonneuroblastoma origin
(RCC26b, RCC45, RCC54, ACHN, U2OS, HT1080, MCF7, and LNCaP) using
standard retroviral transduction protocol.
Western analysis. To analyze the expression of MRP1 and MDR1
proteins, crude membranes were prepared (23) and Western blot analysis
was done as described previously (24). Following incubation with the
appropriate dilution of primary antibody (p53, 1:3,000–1:5,000; p21, 1:500;
Bax, 1:2,000; MRP1, 1:500; P-glycoprotein, 1:200; actin, 1:2,000; GAPDH,
1:20,000) for 2 to 4 h, membranes were washed and then incubated with an
appropriate horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody for 1 to
2 h. Binding of the secondary antibody was detected by SuperSignal (Pierce
Biotechnology).
Irradiation and cell cycle analysis. Irradiation was done using a 137Cs
g-irradiator (model 143-45A, J.L. Shepherd and Associates). For cell cycle
analysis, early log-phase cells were either treated with doxorubicin at
various concentrations for 24 h, or exposed to different dosages of
g-irradiation. At designated time points, floating cells were collected by
centrifugation, combined with trypsinized attached cells, and fixed with icecold 70% ethanol for at least 1 h before incubation at 37jC (30 min) in
staining solution consisting of propidium iodide (50 Ag/mL) and RNase
(2 Ag/mL) in PBS. Stained cells were analyzed for DNA content on a
FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) using CELL Quest analysis
software (Becton Dickinson).
Senescence-associated B-galactosidase staining. For senescenceassociated h-galactosidase activity, cells were fixed and stained at pH 6.0 with
5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indol h-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) as described (25).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were done using StatView
(version 5.0.1; SAS Institute, Inc.). For cytotoxicity assay, determination of
ID50 values and statistical analysis were done as described previously (26).

Results and Discussion
Isolation and properties of a MDR human neuroblastoma
cell line IMR/KAT100. The IMR/KAT100 line was selected as a
result of repeated 3-day exposure of parental IMR-32 human
neuroblastoma cells to stepwise increases of the heavy metal
compound, KAT. The drug resistance profile for both parental IMR32 cells and IMR/KAT100 cells in 72-h cytotoxicity assays is shown
in Fig. 1A. By comparison with the parental IMR-32 cells, IMR/
KAT100 cells displayed 5-fold resistance to the selecting drug, KAT.
In addition, however, these cells also showed significantly increased
resistance to a range of structurally unrelated drugs, including the
anthracyclines doxorubicin and daunorubicin, the Vinca alkaloid
vincristine, the epipodophyllotoxins etoposide and teniposide, the
alkylating agents melphalan and mafosfamide, and the platinum
compound cisplatin. No significant increase in resistance to either
the antifolate methotrexate or the microtubule-stabilizing agent

number of well-characterized genes, associated with a MDR
phenotype, including MDR1, MRP1-3, GST-p, cGCS, and metallothionein. Following RT-PCR analysis, no increased expression of
any of these genes was observed, whereas Western blot analysis
showed no detectable change in either MDR1 or MRP1 protein
levels in the IMR/KAT100 cells by comparison with the parental
IMR-32 cells (data not shown).
To identify possible genetic changes responsible for the unusual
MDR phenotype observed, cDNA microarray analysis was done,
after treatment of the parental and drug-resistant cells, with
varying doses of VP-16 or g-irradiation. Microarray data from two
independent experiments confirmed the lack of involvement of
well-characterized MDR-associated genes (data not shown).
However, IMR/KAT100 cells showed a lack of induction of four
p53-regulated genes, p21 (p21WAF1 ), BTG2, WIP1, and p48, by
comparison with the up-regulation of these genes in the parental
IMR-32 cells. This defective p53 pathway was confirmed by
Western blot analyses in which a dose-dependent induction of
p21 and Bax was observed in IMR-32 parental cells, but not in IMR/
KAT100 cells, after treatment with different concentrations of
doxorubicin (Fig. 1B). We also examined p53-mediated control of
cell cycle checkpoints using fluorescence-activated cell sorting
analysis of cell distribution among the phases of the cell cycle after
low-dosage g-irradiation. Although IMR-32 cells underwent strong
G1-S arrest, as shown by the DNA histogram at 24 h postirradiation,
IMR/KAT100 cells failed to display significant G1-S cell cycle arrest
(Fig. 1C).
The entire coding region of p53 gene was sequenced in the IMR/
KAT100 cells and a point mutation was identified at codon 135
(exon 5) within the DNA-binding domain (G-T transversion),
leading to an amino acid change from cysteine to phenylalanine.
This mutation (M135) was accompanied by loss of heterozygosity,
as shown by a change of a codon 72 polymorphism from CCC/CGC
to CGC. Interestingly, an identical mutation at codon 135 has also
been previously reported in another human neuroblastoma cell line
[SK-N-BE(2c)] established from a patient with relapsed disease (27).
In addition, another study observed that exposure of a MYCNamplified neuroblastoma cell line (UKF-NB-3) to increasing
concentrations of vincristine resulted in the generation of a highly
drug-resistant subline (UKF-NB-3rVCR10), and although this subline
exhibited high levels of P-glycoprotein–mediated MDR, it had also
acquired the exact p53 mutation (M135phe) as observed in the
IMR/KAT100 cells (28). Thus, these observations pointed at p53
pathway deregulation as a potential mechanism for alterations in
the drug sensitivity observed.
To investigate the functionality of the p53 pathway in
neuroblastoma cells, we stably transduced SK-N-SH, SH-EP, and
SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with the constructs expressing
shRNAs against p53 or GFP (negative control), and investigated
the p53 transactivation activity in these cells in response to DNA
damage. As shown in Fig. 2A, after doxorubicin treatment, the
control cells of all three cell lines (SK-N-SH/shGFP, SH-EP/shGFP,
and SH-SY5Y/shGFP) displayed strong dose-dependent induction
of p53, as well as p21 and Bax encoded by p53-responsive genes.
In contrast, knocking down p53 in these cells by shRNA (SK-NSH/shp53, SH-EP/shp53, and SH-SY5Y/shp53) resulted in a loss
of p21 induction, and lack of induction (SK-N-SH/shp53 and
SH-SY5Y/shp53) or reduced induction of Bax (SH-EP/shp53).
Together, these results show that p53 is functional and able to
transcriptionally activate target genes in a range of neuroblastoma cells.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (21). November 1, 2007

Mutant p53 can confer a MDR phenotype into other
neuroblastoma cells. To determine whether the acquisition of
the p53 mutation was responsible for the MDR phenotype of the
IMR/KAT100 cells, p53 wild-type human SH-EP cells were transfected with a p53 M135 construct, pCMV-M135, generated using
site-directed mutagenesis. Following transfection, multiple clones
were isolated, and four were selected for further analysis. Both
these clones expressed high levels of mutant p53 protein (Fig. 2B).
The SH-EP M135 transfectants failed to induce any significant
levels of p21 expression after doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 2B). This
contrasted with the vector controls, SH-EP/CMV1 and SH-EP/
CMV2, both of which strongly induced p53 and p21 after drug
treatment (Fig. 2B). Lack of p21 and Bax induction was also
observed in the mutant clones after treatment with g-irradiation
(data not shown). Furthermore, by comparison with the vector
controls, cell cycle analysis on these mutant transfectants showed
a failure of any significant G1-S cell cycle arrest, 24 h after
g-irradiation compared with control cells (Fig. 2C). Thus, M135
mutant p53 confers a dominant-negative phenotype.
To address the key question of whether the p53 M135 mutation
is able to confer a MDR phenotype in the transfectant SH-EP cells,
we conducted 72-h cytotoxicity assays to a range of cytotoxic drugs
that had similarly been tested in IMR/KAT100 cells (Table 1). By
comparison with the vector controls, the p53 M135-transfected
clones showed significant resistance to doxorubicin (3.7-fold),
VM26 (11.5-fold), cisplatin (2.2-fold), and vincristine (4.1-fold). In
addition, the mutant clones showed 2.4-fold resistance to KAT, the
drug used for selection of the IMR/KAT100 cells. However, none of
the mutant clones exhibited any significant change in response to
either Taxol or methotrexate, drugs to which the IMR/KAT100 cells
were also not resistant.
The results of these short-term cytotoxicity assays also
correlated with the outcome of clonogenic assays, in which the
empty vector controls showed a stronger dose-dependent decline
in the number of colony-forming cells compared with cultures
expressing mutant p53. The mutant clones showed increased
resistance to cisplatin (2.5-fold), vincristine (1.5-fold), VM26 (1.5fold), and doxorubicin (1.4-fold; Table 2). However, the scale of drug
resistance gained by M135-expressing cell lines was smaller
than that of the short-term cytotoxicity assays, suggesting that a
significant fraction of the M135-expressing cells that survived
72-h treatment were incapable of long-term proliferation. Taken
together, these results suggest that p53 status may be an important
marker of treatment response in neuroblastoma, and in this regard
provide support for a previous study by Layfield et al. (29), showing
p53 staining in primary neuroblastoma tumor samples to be a
prognostic of outcome.
p53 M135 mutant–mediated MDR results from its p53suppressive rather than gain-of-function activity. In some
tumor types, gain of function is believed to be mechanism by which
mutant p53 contributes to tumor progression and an increase in
cellular resistance to chemotherapy and ionizing radiation (30). We
tested the possibility of mutant p53 causing up-regulation of drug
resistance genes in SH-EP cells but found no changes in the
expression of MRP1 or MDR1 at either the gene or protein level
(data not shown). Therefore, to determine whether the drugresistant phenotype resulted from loss of wild-type p53 function or
gain of mutant function, we compared the drug resistance of M135expressing cells with similar cells, in which p53 function was
suppressed by either shRNA or GSE56. GSE56 is a suppressing
element that encodes a fragment of p53 acting as a potent

dominant-negative mutant (31). By comparison with the vector
controls (IMR/LXSP and IMR/shGFP), both GSE56- and shRNAtransduced IMR-32 cells (IMR/GSE56 and IMR/shp53) showed
reduced induction of p53-regulated genes p21 and Bax after
doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 2D) and increased resistance to a range
of chemotherapy drugs with different modes of action (Table 3).
Interestingly, inhibiting wild-type p53 function by either p53 GSE56
or by shRNA did not significantly change the sensitivity of IMR-32
cells to Taxol. Thus, the pattern of cross-resistance observed in
neuroblastoma cells with loss of wild-type p53 mirrors that
displayed by the IMR/KAT100 cells.
We abrogated expression of the mutant protein in IMR/KAT100
cells by stably expressing shRNA against p53 using retroviral
transfer. By comparison with control cells transduced with shRNA
against GFP (IMR/KAT100/shGFP), p53 was barely detectable in
the IMR/KAT100 cells transduced with shRNA against p53 (IMR/
KAT100/shp53), either before or after doxorubicin treatment
(Fig. 2D). Cytotoxicity assays showed that IMR/KAT100/shp53
cells were not sensitized to a range of drugs, including cisplatin,
doxorubicin, vincristine, and VM26, by comparison with the
control IMR/KAT100/shGFP cells (Table 3), indicating that gain

www.aacrjournals.org

of function of mutant p53 is not a mechanism of MDR in the IMR/
KAT100 cells. Taken together, the above data strongly suggest that
it is the loss of wild-type p53 function that contributes to the MDR
phenotype in neuroblastoma cells. A previous study, conducted by
Keshelava et al. (14), provided initial evidence that defective p53
function confers MDR in neuroblastoma cell lines. However,
inactivation of wild-type p53 in this study was achieved by
transfection of cells with HPV16 E6 and a number of reports have
shown that the E6 protein has effects other than targeting p53 (32)
and is not equivalent to that of a mutant p53 or a knockout of p53
(33). In contrast to this study, we used highly specific RNA
interference technology and GSEs to silence p53 to generate pairs
of neuroblastoma cell lines with either functional or inactivated
p53. These isogenic pairs of lines have uniquely shown that loss of
functional p53 led to decreased sensitivity to a number of clinically
used drugs. Our results thus provide definitive evidence of a role for
p53 as a drug sensitivity gene in neuroblastoma.
The lack of an effect of p53 status on cellular response to Taxol is
in agreement with previous studies (34, 35) and contrasts with the
increased resistance observed to the microtubule-destabilizing drug
vincristine. Although Taxol and vincristine are both antimicrotubule

explanation for this differential effect after treatment with these
two drugs may relate to the increased expression of the
microtubule-stabilizing protein MAP4, which has been shown to
occur in cells with dysfunctional p53 (37). Understanding the
mechanism of MDR associated with loss of p53 function in
neuroblastoma suggests that Taxol should be more effective in
killing cells undergoing mitotic catastrophe than other chemotherapeutic drugs. However, this prediction remains to be
experimentally tested.
Mechanism of p53-mediated drug response of neuroblastoma cells. To determine mechanism(s) underlying p53 dependence
of drug sensitivity of neuroblastoma cells, we measured distribution

agents, their mechanisms of action are quite distinct. Thus, Taxol
acts by inducing polymerization of microtubules whereas
vincristine acts as a microtubule-depolymerizing drug. Previous
studies have shown that p53 localizes to cellular microtubules and
that treatment with vincristine or Taxol leads to a reduction in
the nuclear accumulation of p53 (36). However, there have also
been a number of reports in the literature that drug response of
cancer cells to Taxol, unlike vincristine, appears to be independent of p53 status. For example, data from a large-scale drug
screening project using 60 different cancer cell lines conducted by
National Cancer Institute showed that response of cells to Taxol
did not have a clear correlation with p53 status (34). One possible

of cells among phases of the cell cycle in cultures of isogenic populations of neuroblastoma cell lines differing in their
p53 function after genotoxic stress. Representative results of these
analyses are shown in Fig. 3(A–C). Doxorubicin- and radiationinduced growth arrest in both types of cells is seen 24 h posttreatment as almost complete lack of cells in S-phase (Fig. 3A and
B). This arrest appeared to be permanent for p53 wild-type cells,
the majority of which stayed on the plates during the whole
duration of the experiment (2 weeks; Fig. 3C). Arrested p53 wildtype cells expressed acidic h-galactosidase, a marker of cellular
senescence (ref. 25; Fig. 3C). In contrast, however, in p53-deficient
cells after DNA damage, growth arrest was either temporary (as
judged by reappearance of S-phase) or incomplete. Resumption of
cell cycle progression was accompanied by gradual accumulation of
cells with both sub-G1 and polyploid (>4C) DNA content (Fig. 3A
and B). Simultaneously, numerous multinucleated cells and cells
with multiple micronuclei appeared (data not shown) and the
population underwent significant cell loss: By the end of the period
of observation, most parts of the plate surface contained no cells
(Fig. 3C). At the same time, in treated populations of p53-deficient
cells, we observed formation of multiple colonies of rapidly dividing
cells with no traces of senescence-specific h-galactosidase (Fig. 3C).
The frequency of such colonies inversely correlated with the dose
of treatment.
The results above indicate that the majority of cells, regardless of
their p53 status, lose the capability to proliferate after DNA
damage. However, the mechanism of such loss is very different in
p53 wild-type and deficient cells. The major type of DNA damage
response of the p53 wild-type neuroblastoma cells is irreversible
growth arrest (senescence) that may occur both in G1 and G2
phases of the cell cycle. However, cells deficient in p53 instead
attempt to proceed through the cell cycle but fail to complete

cytokinesis and become polyploid with DNA segregated among
multiple nuclei, typical signs of mitotic catastrophe, followed by
apoptotic death (appearance of sub-G1 fraction). Hence, p53
prevents neuroblastoma cells from lethal mitotic catastrophe but
brings them into senescence so effectively that it is interpreted by
drug assays as a high degree of drug sensitivity. Although the
majority of cells in p53-deficient variants of this line die from
mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis, this mechanism of cell killing is
less efficient than p53-mediated senescence in p53 wild-type
variant and is interpreted as drug resistance. These data therefore
suggest that lack of p53 does not make each individual cell more
resistant to DNA damage but rather allows rare survivors to
continue to proliferate.
A number of previous studies have shown a defective DNA
damage–induced G1 checkpoint in neuroblastoma cells with wildtype p53 despite p21 induction (38, 39). These data, which were
obtained using relatively high doses of g-irradiation, do not
support a fully functional p53 pathway in this tumor type because
G1 checkpoint control is one of the most critical functions of p53
as a tumor suppressor. In contrast to these investigations, we
found marked G1 arrest in neuroblastoma cells without significant
change in the G2 population after treatment with low dosages of
g-radiation. These changes in cell cycle were not observed in
neuroblastoma cells with mutant p53. At higher dosages of
irradiation, N-type IMR-32 cells underwent apoptosis rather than
cell cycle arrest (data not shown) whereas S-type SH-EP cells
underwent senescence. Similar results were also observed in these
cells after treatment with various dosages of doxorubicin. Thus,
this study shows that the cellular response of wild-type p53
neuroblastoma cells after DNA damage is largely dependent on the
extent of DNA damage and cell type. Our data therefore provide
strong evidence for a fully functional p53 pathway in G1 checkpoint

p53 Determines Drug Sensitivity in Neuroblastoma

control, and the finding of treatment-induced senescence in wildtype p53 neuroblastoma cells provides further evidence of this
functionality.
p53 is not always a drug sensitivity gene: comparison of
neuroblastoma with other cancer cell types. To investigate the
role of p53 in determining drug response in other cell types, we
generated p53-deficient variants from a panel of p53 wild-type
tumor cell lines of nonneuroblastoma origin. The cell lines
investigated included renal carcinoma (RCC26b, RCC45, RCC54,
and ACHN), osteosarcoma (U2OS), lung fibrosarcoma (HT1080),
breast cancer (MCF7), and prostate cancer (LNCaP). In addition,
the colon carcinoma cell line, HCT-116, as well as its p53-deficient
variant HCT-116/p53/, were also studied. Knockdown of p53
was achieved by transduction of p53-suppressive constructs
encoding either shRNA or the dominant-negative p53 mutant,
p53GSE56. All of these p53-deficient variants displayed dramatic
reduction of p21 and Bax induction after doxorubicin treatment
compared with the control cell lines (data not shown).
The response of these isogenic pairs of tumor cell lines to
chemotherapeutic drugs was measured by short-term cytotoxicity
assays, and the results are shown in Fig. 3D. Similar to the results
above with the neuroblastoma cell lines, p53 suppression conferred
a drug resistance phenotype in breast cancer, prostate cancer, and
colon carcinoma, whereas no effect or increased drug sensitivity
was observed in renal cell carcinoma, osteosarcoma, and lung
fibrosarcoma.
p53 alterations have been linked to the failure of radiotherapy
and chemotherapy in a variety of cancers both in vitro and in vivo
(40, 41). In hematologic malignancies, p53 mutations are less
frequent but a strong correlation was found to be associated with
unfavorable prognostic factors and resistance to chemotherapy
(41, 42). Likewise, p53 mutations in breast cancer have been

associated with resistance to tamoxifen, doxorubicin, and radiotherapy (41, 43), whereas similar mutations in ovarian cancer
patients were found to be significantly correlated with resistance to
platinum-based chemotherapy, early relapse, and shortened overall
survival (44). However, clinical data are also emerging to support
both positive and negative correlations between p53 mutations and
drug sensitivity of tumors. For example, p53 mutations have been
correlated with increased drug sensitivity in bladder cancer (41). In
this study, we observed that suppression of p53 produced no change
in drug sensitivity in one osteosarcoma line and in three renal
cancer cell lines while increasing drug susceptibility in another
renal carcinoma line. These data again indicate that p53 does not
have one defined function in cancer susceptibility to treatment. Cell
death or survival depends on the balance among p53-dependent
apoptosis, p53-induced senescence, p53-dependent temporary
growth arrest, p53-mediated DNA repair as well as the existence
of alternative mechanisms preventing mitotic catastrophe (45). This
balance is regulated by largely unknown modulators that determine
the final outcome of p53 activation in response to drug treatment,
many of which are likely to be tissue specific. This indicates that the
clinical effect of p53 mutations must be assessed in a tissue context.
