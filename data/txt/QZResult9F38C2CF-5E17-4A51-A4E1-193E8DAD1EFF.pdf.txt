ABSTRACT
Chemoresistance is the major impediment for treating pancreatic cancer. Herbderived compound triptolide (TP) can inhibit proliferation of chemo-resistant pancreatic
cancer (CPC) cell lines through multiple mechanisms, which exhibited superior
anticancer efficacy compared with gemcitabine. However, toxicity due to non-specific
exposure to healthy tissues hindered its clinical translation. Herein we successfully
achieved targeting CPC cells and avoiding exposure to healthy tissues for TP by
nucleolin-specific aptamer (AS1411) mediated polymeric nanocarrier. We conjugated
AS1411 aptamer to carboxy terminated poly(ethylene glycol)–block–poly(d, l-lactide)
(HOOC-PEG-PDLLA), then prepared AS1411-PEG-PDLLA micelle loading TP (AS-PPT)
through solid dispersion technique. AS-PPT showed more antitumor activity than TP
and equivalent specific binding ability with gemcitabine-resistant human pancreatic
cancer cell (MIA PaCa-2) to AS1411 aptamer in vitro. Furthermore, we studied the
distribution of AS-PPT (Cy3-labed TP) at tissue and cellular levels using biophotonic
imaging technology. The results showed AS1411 facilitated TP selectively accumulating
in tumor tissues and targeting CPC cells. The lifetime of the MIA PaCa-2 cell-bearing
mice administrated with AS-PPT was efficiently prolonged than that of the mice
subjected to the clinical anticancer drug Gemzar® in vivo. Such work provides a new
strategy for overcoming the drug resistance of pancreatic cancer.

INTRODUCTION

major concern during its clinical application [6–9]. Hence,
developing novel chemotherapeutic drug to overcome the
drug resistance of pancreatic cancer is becoming a real
challenge.
Chemoresistance in PC is triggered by various
molecular mechanisms including aberrant gene
expression, mutations, deregulation of key signaling
pathways (such as NF-κB, Akt, and apoptosis pathways),
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the
presence of stroma cells, highly resistant cells and stem
cells [2–5]. Each of those mechanisms contributes to drug
resistance in pancreatic cancer from different aspects, and

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most aggressive
human malignancies with a historically dismal long-term
prognosis, which accounts for 2% of all cancers but 6%
of cancer deaths worldwide [1]. Chemoresistance is the
major impediment for treating PC, which can arise de
novo or can be acquired (therapy-induced) refractoriness
to anticancer chemotherapeutic interventions [2–5].
Gemcitabine has been recognized by many oncologists
as the first-line drug to treat pancreatic cancer, however,
insensitivity due to singleness of therapeutic target is the

recommends different therapeutic targets. Triptolide (TP,
Figure 1 is the structure of Triptolide) is a major active
compound of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F, which can
inhibit proliferation of chemo-resistant pancreatic cancer
cells (CPC) through multiple pathways, such as inhibition
of P-glycoprotein, Heat Shock Protein 70 (HSP70),
NF- κB, Bax gene and angiogenesis, etc, which exhibited
superior anticancer efficacy compared to gemcitabine and
taxanes in vitro [6, 10–17]. However, TP-induced toxicity
due to non-specific exposure to healthy tissues (e.g. liver)
hindered its clinical translation. In addition, higher
intratumoral accumulation is difficult for anticancer agents
with no specific ligands, of note, one major mechanism of
DR is the efflux of drug from the cell by P-glycoprotein,
thereby keeping the intracellular levels below the killing
threshold [18]. Thus, realizing TP selectively targeting
PC tissues or cells to enhance uptake and simultaneouly
reduce side effect may be practical to reverse DR with
longer survival time.
Nucleolin overexpressed on the plasma membrane
of PC cells compared with normal cells, which can
work as a cell surface receptor [19, 20]. Aptamers are
single-stranded oligonucleotides which can specifically
recognize and bind to targets by distinct secondary and
tertiary structures. Aptamer, as target moieties, conjugated
to nano-vehicles have been studied in many research
articles [21–24]. Nucleolin-specific aptamer (AS1411,
5′GGTGGTGGTGGTTGTGGTGGTGGTG G-3) is a
G-rich phosphodiester oligonucleotide with high affinity
and specificity to nucleolin, which  has been proved to
be safe in clinical research [25]. Then, this provide us an
inspiration of developing AS1411-mediated nanoparticle
to achieve CPC-specific delivery of TP.

In pilot study, we have developed triptolide-polymeric
micelle (TP-PM) by polymer-based delivery system, which
not only overcame the pitfall of hydrophobicity, but also
facilitated TP passively accumulating in cancerous tissues
based on the Enhanced Permeability and Retention (EPR)
effect [26]. Nevertheless, as passive targeting nanoscale
preparations, TP-PM suffers from some limitations including
the degree of tumor vascularization and angiogenesis, high
interstitial fluid pressure of solid tumors leading to drug
expulsion and opsonins interaction, etc [27, 28], which
limited its therapeutic effect. Herein, we conjugated AS1411
to TP micelle composed with poly(ethylene glycol)–block–
poly (D, L-lactide) (PEG- PDLLA) diblock copolymers,
which was termed AS- PPT (Figure 2). PEG-PDLLA was
chosen as a drug carrier for TP due to its biodegradability
and biocompatibility properties, which has been applied in
the formulation of Genexol-PM® for treatment of metastatic
carcinoma of ovary and breast after failure of first-line
or subsequent chemotherapy [29,  30]. In this study, we
investigated the tissue and cellular levels distribution of ASPPT (Cy3-labed TP) using biophotonic imaging. The results
showed AS1411 could facilitate TP selectively targeting
CPC cells and accumulating in tumor tissues. In addition,
AS- PPT possess more antitumor efficacy than nontargeted
TP-PM in a xenograft mouse model of gemcitabinresistant human pancreatic cancer (MIA PaCa-2),
and the lifetime of the MIA PaCa-2 cell-bearing mice
administrated with AS-PPT was efficiently prolonged
than that of the mice subjected to the clinical anticancer
drug Gemzar® in vivo. These indicated AS1411 aptamer
can facilitate TP selectively targeting CPC cells and
accumulating in tumor tissues, AS-PPT may be a potential
active targeting drug for CPC.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

and the highest DL and EE can reach to 6.1 ± 0.10% and
97.1 ± 1.01%, respectively. The AS-PPT (DL = 4%) was
chosen to characterize in detail. The average size of ASPPT was about 41.7 ± 1.5 nm (Figure 4B.) and PDI was
0.100 ± 0.023. Li Tang and his coworkers have proved that
the 50 nm nanomedicine have highest anticancer effect for
its highest tumor tissue retention, penetration and efficient
cancer cell internalization [31]. This maybe one reason
for its higher anticancer effect in the following studies.
Figure 4C was the TEM image of AS-PPT in water, which
showed AS-PPT were uniform and spherical shapes in
solution, and such Figure was consisted with the result
tested by Malvern Nano-ZS 90 laser particle size analyzer.

Characterization of AS1411-PEG-PDLLA
polymer and AS-PPT
AS1411 aptamer, HOOC-PEG-PDLLA and AS- PP
polymer were characterized by mass spectrometry
(MS), 1H-NMR and polyacrylamide gel electroporesis
(PAGE) respectively. The results were shown in Figure 3.
Figure  3A (a) showed the molecular weight of NH2AS1411 aptamer was 8486.0. Figure 3A (b) was the
1H-NMR spectrum of HOOC-PEG-PDLLA polymer
material. PAGE was utilized to examine the conjugation
of AS1411 to HOOC-PEG-PDLLA, and to demonstrate
successful removal of unconjugated aptamers after
the reaction. The mixing of aptamer and NPs without
the addition of the coupling agent (AS+PP, Figure 3B
(e)) did not show any band of conjugated aptamer after
repetitive washing by ultracentrifugation (10000 × g,
15°C, 15 minutes) in centrifugal filter tubes (MWCO 10k),
indicating a lack of non-specific interaction between the
aptamer and HOOC-PEG-PDLLA. However, conjugation
with the addition of EDC (AS-PP, Figure 3B (d)) leads
to RNA bands consistent with RNA covalently bound to
the HOOC-PEG-PDLLA even after the same repetitive
washing by ultracentrifugation, which indicated AS1411PEG-PDLLA polymer was obtained.
AS-PPT was prepared by solid dispersion technique
using MPEG-PDLLA and AS-PP polymer (10:1). The
appearance of AS-PPT was shown in Figure 4A, and
the clear solution could be observed. DL and EE can be
changed through varying the mass ratio of TP / carrier,

The selectivity and antitumor activity of
AS-PPT in vitro
To confirm the specific binding ability of AS-PPT to
cancerous cells, either the Cy3-labeled TP loaded in ASPPT or Cy3-labeled TP loaded in TP-PM were incubated
with human pancreatic carcinoma cell line MIA PaCa-2 and
human liver cell line L-02 respectively. Figure 5 (A1–D1)
and Figure 5 (A2–D2) were the cell images observed with
interference-phase contrast microscope and fluorescence
microscope, respectively, and Figure 5 (A3–D3) were their
overlay images. Figure 5A2 showed the close fluorescence
intensity with Figure 5B2, which illustrated AS-PPT had
no specific-targeting L-02 cells compared with TP-PM, in
addition, the Figure 5A3 and Figure 4B3 further confirmed
such results. In contrast, MIA PaCa-2 cells in AS-PPT
group (Figure 5D2) showed stronger fluorescence intensity
than that of TP-PM group (Figure 5C2). Especially,

Figure 5D3 showed stronger red fluorescence signal in MIA
PaCa-2 cells than that of Figure 5C3, which implied ASPPT group had higher internalizing ability with MIA PaCa2 cell than that of TP-PM group. This should be attributed
to the specific binding ability of AS1411 aptamer with
nucleolin overexpressed on the surface of cancerous cells.
Considering the controlled-release behavior of
TP-PM and AS-PPT [26], we compared the cytotoxicity
of them with free TP and Gemcitabine on MIA PaPa2 cells for 48 h. The viability of cells was measured
consecutively at arranged time points using MTT assays.
The results showed that the presence of TP, TP-PM and
AS-PPT significantly reduced MIA PaPa-2 cell viability
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6). It seemed that
AS-PPT and free TP have the same antitumor activities,
but more activities than TP-PM in vitro, which might be
ascribed to the mediation of AS1411 strengthening the
cell endocytosis of AS-PPT. Compared with Gemcitabine,
lower nanomolar concentrations of each TP formulation
induced pancreatic cancer cell death, indicating TP
exhibited more antitumor activities than Gemcitabine
in vitro.

groups showed the same fluorescence signals intensity at
6h, which should be ascribed to their nanostructure, this is
also in line with the findings of Li Tang [31]. In contrast,
the fluorescence signal intensity of AS-PPT in tumor were
significantly higher than that of TP-PM at 12 h (Figure 7),
which may be attribute to that AS1411 aptamer-mediated
nanoparticle interacted highly with the cancerous cells
and inhibited the efflux of AS-PPT from the cell by
P-glycoprotein. In addition, other tissues such as spleen
and lung of TP-PM group showed negligible fluorescence
signal at 6 h post-injection. And the fluorescence signals
in heart, spleen and lung were hardly detected in AS-PPT
administration group at either 6 h or 12 h.

In vivo pharmacodynamics of AS-PPT
To evaluate the pharmacodynamics of AS-PPT,
we compared the in vivo antitumor efficiency of TP-PM,
AS-PPT and Gemzar® in xenograft mouse model of MIA
PaCa-2. When the treatment began, the body weight and
tumor volume were monitored and calculated every two
days. The results were shown in Figure 8. We found that
TP-PM and AS-PPT can significantly inhibited tumor
growth compared with negative control (NS) and positive
control (Gemzar®), and the therapeutic group (AS-PPT)
showed the slowest growth rate of tumor volume among
the four groups. From the Figure 8A, we can see that
TP- PM, AS-PPT and Gemzar ® group showed similar
growth rate of tumors during the early stage, furthermore,
both the TP-PM and AS-PPT group showed slower
tumor growth rate during the late stage of treatment,
especially, that of AS-PPT group was the slowest among
four groups, the reason might be the sustained release of
TP from AS-PPT and higher AS-PPT accumulation in

In vivo distribution studies
To evaluate whether the AS1411 aptamer-mediated
nanocarrier loading TP can indeed specifically targeting
tumors, we used biophotonic imaging technology to
examine the tissue distribution of Cy3-labeled TP
delivered by TP-PM and AS-PPT. Figure 7 showed that
both formulations were prone to accumulate in liver and
kidney for the initial 6 h, which should be attributed to
the rapid uptake by mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS)
and glomerular filtration [32, 33]. The tumor of two

cancerous cells mediated by AS1411 aptamer. There were
significant differences between positive group (Gemzar ®)
and therapeutic groups , respectively (*P < 0.05). Weight
profiles showed a largish loss within the first week in
negative control group (NS), TP-PM and AS-PPT groups
than that of positive control group (Gemzar®), whereas
the body weight of the mice in three therapeutic groups
(TP-PM, AS-PPT, Gemzar®) all exhibited steady increase

than that of negative control group after the 10th day
(Figure 8B). Contrary to our expectation, the body weight
of positive control group (Gemzar®) exhibited higher
increase than that of TP-PM and AS-PPT group, the reason
should be the toxicity of TP released from delivery system,
which bring the discomfort to mice.
Evaluation of the effect of AS-PPT on mice survival
was accomplished and displayed in Figure 8C. It can

be seen that more than half of mice in negative control
group and positive control group died within 10, 20 days,
respectively. Half of mice in TP-PM group died within
18 days, however, the mice with 40% survived for 24 days.
In contrast, the therapeutic group administrated AS-PPT
still remained half mice after 24 days. Significance were
assessed compared with the control group of Gemzar ®
(*p < 0.05).

micrograph of tumor tissue of mice treated with NS,

scattered focal cancer cell nests are in gland tube-like
arrangement with red blood cell aggregation within the
lumen, in addition, the tissue necrosis and inflammatory
cell infiltration can be observed in Figure 9A. All these
indicated the NS has no inhibition of cancer cells. Figure 9B
shows a wide range of cancer cell necrosis and
inflammatory cell infiltration, indicating Gemazar with
good effect for inhibiting cancer cells. Figure 9C is the
group with administration of TP-PM, from the figure,
we can find a lot of necrotic tissue and inflammatory
cell infiltration, indicating that TP-PM has good

anti-gemcitabin-resistant pancreatic cancer efficacy,
these should be ascribed to nanocarrier facilitating TP
with multiple therapeutic target accumulating in tumor
tissue. From the Figure 9D, a lot of cancer cells undergo
apoptosis, scattered focal cancer cell nests arranged in
gland tube-like. AS-PPT exhibited superior anticancer
efficacy compared to Gemazar® group and TP-PM group,
which should be attributed to AS1411 aptamer provide
AS-PPT an approach to achieve nucleolin-specific
delivery and promoting endocytosis of cancerous cells for
AS-PPT, which is also consistent with the survival results.

CONCLUSION
Effective treatment of pancreatic cancer is a long
cherished object for medical workers. A viable strategy
have been developed, such as surgery, radiotherapy
and chemotherapy, etc. However; each suffers its own
specific limitations mainly arising from local recurrence
and metastatic spread of such disease. Pathological sitespecific delivery of active agents was considered to be

a perfect strategy. Nanoscience generated nano-sized
carriers provides potential to realize such purpose based on
EPR effect, however, the sole nanocarrier with no specific
ligands are not sufficient to deliver drugs to target sites.
Nowadays, ligand-modified nanoscale preparations have
been considered to effectively improve the anti-tumor
efficacy based on EPR effect and subsequent endocytosis
of cancerous cells via ligand–receptor interaction. As
one of the most excellent targeting ligands, aptamers can
selectively bind to a variety of targets ranging from small
molecules to whole cells due to their three-dimensional
structures even without knowledge of characteristic
protein profiles on cell surface. Triptolide posses multiple
therapeutic targets for cancer, however, hydrophobicity
and toxicity due to non-specific exposure to healthy tissues
hindered its clinical translation. Currently, we constructed
AS1411 aptamer modified PEG-PDLLA micelle loading
TP with an average diameter of 41.7 ± 1.5 nm. The in vitro
results showed that AS-PPT had specific binding ability
with human pancreatic carcinoma cell (MIA PaCa-2) but
no specific-targeting L-02 cells compared with TP-PM.

This should be attributed to the specific binding ability
of AS1411 aptamer with nucleolin overexpressed on the
surface of cancerous cells.
In vivo tumor inhibition study revealed that the
AS-PPT has superior anti-tumour efficacy on PC cells
when compared with TP-PM and Gemzar® . Furthermore,
in vivo distribution studies showed AS-PPT kept more TP
accumulation in tumor and extend tumor residence than
TP-PM, this should be attribute to the specific interaction
between AS1411 aptamer and nucleolin significantly
enhanced cellular uptake of AS-PPT and inhibited the
efflux of AS-PPT from the cell by P-glycoprotein. Based
on the foregoing experimental data, we concluded that
AS1411 aptamer-medicated nanocarrier can facilitate
TP accumulating in tumor tissues via EPR effect, when
they entered the tumor interstitial space, AS1411 aptamer
presented on the AS-PPT surface quickly recognized
cancerous cell followed by AS1411-nucleolin interaction,
and consequently enhanced the inhibition of tumor growth.
In conclude, AS-PPT have great potential for reversing the
drug resistance of pancreatic cancer.

All animals would be in quarantine for a week before
treatment. All animals care and experimental procedures
were conducted according to Institutional Animal Care
and Use guidelines.

Preparation and characterization of TP-PM and
AS-PPT
Preparation of TP-PM
The synthesis, preparation and characteristics of
MPEG2000–PDLLA6000 diblock copolymers and TP-PM
have been described in our previous publications [26, 35].
To prepare TP-PM, some MPEG-PDLLA copolymer and
TP were dissolved in 3 mL of dehydrated acetonitrile
under vigorous stirring. After all contents were dissolved,
the solution was evaporated on a rotary evaporator under
reduced pressure at 60°C. Upon acetonitrile evaporation,
a homogenous coevaporation was obtained. TP was
distributed into polymeric carriers in an amorphous form.
Then, the coevaporation was dissolved in 5 ml of water at
65°C to create the TP polymeric micelle solution, and the
solution was filtered with a 0.22 μm filter to obtain a clear
solution. Then, the solution was lyophilized in a freeze dry
system to obtain a dried powder.

Preparation of AS-PPT
PEG2000-PDLLA6000 copolymer and AS-PP freezedried powder (at a ratio of 10:1), TP were dissolved in
500 μL of dehydrated acetonitrile under vigorous shaking.
After all contents were dissolved, the solution was
evaporated under reduced pressure at 60°C. Then, the
coevaporation were dissolved in 1 ml of water at 60°C to
create the AS-PPT solution, and the solution was filtered
with a 0.22 μm filter to obtain a clear solution. Then, the
solution was lyophilized in a freeze dry system to obtain
a dried powder.
The drug loading (DL) and encapsulation efficiency
(EE) of AS-PPT were determined as follows: First, a
standard absorbance curve was established with a series
of standard TP solution to facilitate the determination
of the exact amount of drug within the TP-PM and ASPPT (data not shown). Determination of the TP quantity
within the AS-PPT was done by high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC. The column temperature was
30 °C. The mobile phase was composed of methanol/
acetonitrile/water (15/20/65, v/v/v %). The ﬂow rate was
1.0 mL/min and the detection wavelength is 218 nm.
Based on this data, the DL and EE of TP-PM and AS-PPT
were calculated according to eqn. (1) and (2):

Synthesis and characterization of AS1411-PEGPDLLA polymer
AS1411-PEG2000-PDLLA6000
polymer
was
synthesized by EDC/NHS technique [34, 35] Briefly, some
HOOC- PEG2000-PDLLA6000 polymer suspended in 5ml
DNase/RNase-free water (10 μg/μL) were incubated with

formula V = [length × (width)2 ] M/2, where length is
the longest diameter and width is the shortest diameter
perpendicular to length. Once the tumors reached
200 mm3, the mice will be randomly divided into 2 groups
(n = 4 for each group), and respectively subjected to
TP-PM and AS-PPT at the same dose of 0.2 mg/ kg
of cy3-labeled TP via tail vein injection. Two mice
of each group will be sacrificed at 6 h and 12 h after
the administration and the major organs (heart, liver,
spleen, lung, kidney and tumor) will be collected. The
fluorescence signal of those organs in each group will be
detected using Xenogen IVIS imaging system (Xenogen
Imaging Technologies, Alameda, CA). Excitation (λex =
445–490 nm) and Emission (λem = 515–575 nm) filters
were used. Identical illumination settings including
exposure time (5 s), binning factor (4), f-stop (2) and
fields of view (15 cm for width and length, respectively),
will be used for all image acquisition. Fluorescent and
photographic images will be acquired and overlaid. The
in vivo experiments were performed in accordance with
institutional guidelines and in compliance with national
and international law and policies. All efforts were made to
minimize the number of animals used and their suffering.

The particle size of prepared AS-PPT nano-micelle
was determined using a Malvern Nano-ZS 90 laser
particle size analyzer after equilibration for 10 min.
The morphological characteristics of the AS-PPT were
examined by transmission electron microscope (TEM,
H-6009IV, Hitachi, Japan).

The Selectivity and antitumor activity of AS-PPT
in vitro
To confirm the specific binding ability of AS-PPT
to cancer cells, the AS-PPT (Cy3-labeled TP) and the TPPM (Cy3-labeled TP) were respectively incubated with
human pancreatic carcinoma cell line MIA PaCa-2 and
human liver cell line L-02. Briefly, cells were plated at
a density of 1 × 104 cells per well in 100 μL of DMEM
medium in 96-well plates and grown for 24 h. The cells
were then exposed to TP-PM and AS-PPT at the same
concentrations of cy3-labeled TP for 2 h. After incubation,
the cells were washed using PBS buffer solution for three
times to remove the free TP, TP-PM and AS-PPT. Then the
cells were observed with fluorescence microscope.
To confirm whether AS-PPT have more antitumor
activity than free TP, TP-PM and Gemzar®, the MIA
PaCa-2 cells were incubated with the different TP
concentrations of free TP solution , TP-PM, AS-PPT and
Gemzar® for 48 h at 37 oC. After that, the viability of cells
was measured consecutively at arranged time points using
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-di-phenyl tetrazolium
bromide (MTT, Sigma-Aldrich) assays.
All the results obtained from MTT assays were
confirmed by repeating at six individual experiments, and
all data were expressed as the mean ± S.D.

Pharmacodynamics
Briefly, fifty two eight-week-old healthy female
BALB/c nude mice (18–20 g body weight) were injected
subcutaneously on the right back with 0.1 mL of cell
suspension containing MIA PaCa-2 cell (1 × 107/ml).
Treatment was initiated when the tumor reached a size of
approximately 200 mm3, the mice were randomly divided
into four groups containing thirteen animals and samples
were administered via vein once a week for three weeks.
Group 1 kept as the negative control group and receive
0.1 mL dose of normal saline (NS), group 2 received
0.1 mL of Gemzar® with 20 mg/kg (as the positive control
group), group 3 received 0.1 mL of TP-PM with dosage
of 0.32 mg/kg TP and group 4 received 0.1 mL of ASPPT with dosage of 0.32 mg/kg TP. During this period,
the mice were observed continuously for relevant indexes,
such as body weight, tumor volume and survival rate.
Three mice of each group were sacrificed on the 3th
week post-treatment and the tumor were harvested and
fixed in 10% buffered formaldehyde solution and then
embedded in paraffin. Sections of 3–5 mm were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) and observed on light
microscope and electron microscopic measurements.

of AS-PPT in a xenograft mouse model of CPC
Tissue distribution
For visually showing the tissue distribution of
AS-PPT in animal model of CPC, fluorescence imaging
will be performed using an IVIS® 200 imaging system.
Eight eight-week-old healthy female BALB/c nude mice
(18–20 g body weight) will be inoculated with 100 μl
of MIA PaCa-2 cell (1 × 107/ml) suspended in normal
saline on the right flank. Tumor size will be measured
every other day using vernier calipers in two dimensions.
Individual tumor volumes (V) were calculated using the
