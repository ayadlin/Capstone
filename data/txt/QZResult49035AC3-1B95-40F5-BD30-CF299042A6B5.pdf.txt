ABSTRACT
Treatment resistance significantly inhibits the efficiency of targeted cancer
therapies in drug-sensitive genotypes. In the current work, we studied mechanisms
for rapidly occurring, adaptive resistance in targeted therapy-sensitive lung, breast,
and melanoma cancer cell lines. The results show that in ALK translocated lung cancer
lines H3122 and H2228, cells with cancer stem-like cell features characterized by high
expression of cancer stem cell markers and/or in vivo tumorigenesis can mediate
adaptive resistance to oncogene ablative therapy. When pharmacological ablation of
ALK oncogene was accompanied with PI3K inhibitor or salinomycin therapy, cancer
stem-like cell features were reversed which was accompanied with decreased colony
formation. Furthermore, co-targeting was able to block the formation of acquired
resistance in H3122 line. The results suggest that cells with cancer stem-like cell
features can mediate adaptive resistance to targeted therapies. Since these cells
follow the stochastic model, concurrent therapy with an oncogene ablating agent and
a stem-like cell-targeting drug is needed for maximal therapeutic efficiency.

INTRODUCTION

heterogeneity. These genetic alterations can produce cells
with self-renewing and proliferating capacity resulting
generation of cancer stem-like cells (CSLC) [1-3].
High tumorigenity in xenograft models is taken
as the gold standard for the identification of CSCs or
CSLCs, but they can also be identified by various cell
surface markers such as CD44high/CD42low (breast
cancer), CD133high (glioblastoma) and high aldehyde
dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) expression or activity (various
solid tumors) [4-7]. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) has been linked to the cancer stem cell phenotype
in many studies [8, 9]. Presence of cells with CSC
features has been connected with a poor patient outcome
[4, 10] and with resistance to traditional chemotherapy
and radiotherapy [11, 12]. Some works have also
shown association of these markers to targeted therapy
resistance [13, 14]. Studies have shown that traditional
cancer therapies preferentially target the proliferating,
differentiated cells rather than the CSCs, although some
pharmacological agents such as salinomycin, abamectin,

The efficiency of targeted cancer therapies in drugsensitive genotypes such as HER2 amplified breast cancer,
B-Raf mutant melanoma and ALK translocated non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is significantly inhibited by
treatment resistance. This resistance is often divided into
early de novo resistance, in which cancer cells are initially
unaffected by the drug, and late, acquired resistance,
in which the cells gain resistance by a mechanism that
abolishes the effect of the drug. Furthermore, adaptive
resistance mechanisms also occur in which cells are able
to survive in the presence of the drug, remaining in either
a dormant or a slowly dividing state.
Tumor heterogeneity is often explained by cancer
stem cell (CSC) models. In these hierarchic models, cells
having CSC potential and ability to generate cells with
self-limited proliferative capacity maintain the CSCs pool.
Furthermore, clonal evolution of cells with additional
genetic alterations is another driving force for tumor

etoposide, and disulfiram have been shown to target
CSLCs in vitro [15-17]. Furthermore, various signalling
pathways have been linked to the cancer stem cell
phenotype e. g. Wnt, Notch and ß-catenin [18].
The acquired resistance to targeted therapies
that affects all patients with metastatic disease can
occur through various mechanisms, such as point
mutations in the target gene that lower its affinity for
the drug, activation of other tyrosine kinases, and EMT
[19]. The role of adaptive resistance and CSLSs in
acquired resistance to targeted therapies remains largely
unexplored. Cancer cells capable of undergoing adaptive
resistance could be responsible for the minimal residual
disease and serve as a source of acquired resistance.

The current study investigates the role of cells with
CSLC features in resistance to targeted cancer therapies
for NSCLC, breast cancer and melanoma. Furthermore,
it considers drug combinations capable of inhibiting cells
with CSLC features in adaptive, and acquired resistance.

RESULTS
Adaptive resistance to ALK inhibition is mediated
by ALHD1-positive cells
H3122, an ALK–translocated and dependent NSCLC
cell line, was selected as an initial model for studying

adaptive drug resistance. Pharmacological inhibition of
ALK in H3122 cells causes marked cell death, although
a small fraction of the cells do survive for long periods
of time but without marked proliferation. When the ALK
inhibitor is withdrawn, the cells rapidly start to proliferate,
and when re-challenged with the drug, a marked response
is seen once more. Furthermore, H3122 forms papillary
structures in vitro, which are abolished by treatment
with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), suggesting
some form of hierarchy among the tumor cells. We thus
hypothesized that this would be a good model for studying
the mechanisms of adaptive resistance to targeted cancer
therapy.
We first treated H3122 cells with the ALK
inhibitor TAE684 for 7 days, after which the drug was
withdrawn and the cultures were analyzed by phase
contrast microscopy. As in previous studies, TAE684
induced marked cell death, a decline in cell numbers and
a disappearance of the papillary structure. When TAE684
was withdrawn, the remaining cells quickly started to
re-proliferate and form papillary structures (Figure 1A).
After 14 days of re-growth, they were re-challenged with
TAE684, eliciting a similar response to that following the
initial drug challenge (not shown). H3122 cells are also
highly sensitive pharmacologically to concurrent dual
inhibition of PI3K and MEK kinases [20, 21]. As with
ALK inhibition, dual inhibition of PI3K and MEK induced
marked cell death and a reduction in the number of cells
during 7 days of treatment followed by a rapid recovery
of the cell population after drug withdrawal (Figure 1A).
Furthermore, a re-challenge with the same drug regimen
resulted in a similar response as initially (not shown).
Next we wanted to investigate whether H3122 cells
respond differently to a combination of ALK treatment and
dual PI3K/MEK inhibitor treatment. The responses and regrowth occurred in the same manner regardless of whether
the cells were first challenged with the ALK inhibitor and
after regrowth with dual PI3K and MEK inhibition or vice
versa (not shown). Conversely, the magnitude of the rate
of repopulation was markedly reduced, but not blocked,
when both drug regimens were administered concurrently
(Figure 1A).
We speculated that cells showing adaptive resistance
might bear a CSLC phenotype, and we therefore studied
the expression of ALDH1, a marker of CSCs, in the same
experimental setting using Western blot analysis. ALHD1
expression was low in untreated H3122 cells, but the ALK
inhibitor treatment with TAE684 induced it gradually but
to a marked extent from 12 h of treatment onwards (Figure
1B). A similar increase in ALDH1 was also seen with
crizotinib, another unrelated ALK inhibitor, suggesting
that the phenomenon is related to ALK inhibition rather
than to any specific inhibitor (Figure 1D). When TAE684
was withdrawn for 14 days, ALDH1 expression remained
at the initial, low level. When the cells were re-challenged
after regrowth with TAE684 similar induction of ALHD1
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

was detected. When the cells were initially challenged
with TAE684 and later with dual PI3K/MEK inhibition, no
marked increase in ALDH1 expression was detected, while
reversing the order produced a marked increase in ALDH1
expression. When the H3122 cells were challenged
initially with dual PI3K/MEK inhibition, a low level of
induction of ALDH1 expression was detected, which did
not disappear after drug withdrawal (Figure 1B).
We next wanted to investigate whether any other
CSC marker correlated with ALDH1 in the H3122 line.
Since EMT has been linked to cancer stem cells, we set
out to study the EMT markers E-cadherin and vimentin
in this context. We could not see any downregulation of
E-cadherin or upregulation of vimentin, however (Figure
1C). Expression of CD44, a marker linked to the CSC
phenotype in some cancers, was also undetectable in the
H3122 cells both before and after ALK inhibition (Figure
1E).

TAE684-Treated, ALHD1-positive cells are highly
tumorigenic in the xenograft model
H3122 cells transfected with a luciferase reporter
gene were shown to have a similar level of ALDH1
induction and cytotoxic response to TAE684 in vitro as the
original, untransfected cell line. Furthermore, cells treated
for 4 days with TAE684 following drug withdrawal of 24
h before analysis, showed the induced ALDH1 expression
(Figure 2A-B). Next, the H3122 Luc cells were treated
with TAE684 for 14 days to induce ALDH1-positivity
and the drug was withdrawn 24 h before injection of the
cells into mice, to diminish the potential negative effects
of the drug on tumorigenesis. 10,000 or 100,000 of either
non-treated control or TAE684-treated, luciferase reporterincorporated H3122 cells were injected subcutaneously
into mice on both flanks. The number injected cells was
selected based on preliminary experiments with H3122 in
which 100,000 cells was able to generate tumour in most
mice while no tumour formation was seen 10,000 or 1,000
cells injected. All the mice injected with 100,000 cells
in both groups rapidly generated tumors, with a similar
rate of occurrence, but an increase in tumorigenesis was
seen in the mice injected with 10,000 cells in the tumors
initiating from TAE684-treated cells, so that 40% of these
mice developed tumors whereas none of the mice injected
with control cells had tumors during the follow-up period
of 9 weeks (Figure 2C).
Dissected tumors (100,000 cells) from both nontreated and TAE684-treated H3122 cells were analyzed
for immunohistochemical ALDH1 expression. Human
gallbladder epithelium, in which a high expression of
ALDH1 has been reported in previous studies, served
as a positive control. Patchy expression of ALDH1 was
detected in the H3122-derived tumors, with only a very
few positive tumor cells, arranged either in small groups

or as single cells (Figure 2E). We could not detect any
major difference in the number or arrangement of ALDH1positive cells in either group of tumors (not shown).

Pharmacological Screening for
Targeting ALDH1-Positive Cells

an

possessed this activity as a single agent in the H3122
line, whereas ABT-263 and salinomycin had no activity
alone (Figure 3A). Initial phase contrast analysis had also
suggested that dual PI3K/MEK inhibition would reduce
colony formation with TAE684, but the pharmacological
screening showed that only PI3K inhibition is needed
for such inhibition and that the MEK inhibitor alone or
in combination with TAE684 did not have any activity in
this setting (Figure 3A). PI-103, a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor,
also induced a similar inhibition of colony formation alone
and in combination with TAE684 to that observed with
ZSTK474, suggesting that it is a PI3K inhibition-mediated
class effect (not shown).
Since ZSTK474, ABT-263 and salinomycin
inhibited colony formation in combination with TAE684,
we then investigated the effect of these combinations on
ALDH1 expression. When the H3122 cells were treated
with salinomycin, ZSTK474, or ZSTK474 with CI-1040
(MEK inhibitor) no marked increase in ALDH1 expression
was seen, while TAE684 induced high ALDH1 expression.
When TAE684 was combined with salinomycin,
ZSTK474, or ZSTK474 and CI-1040, marked inhibition
of ALDH1 induction was seen, this being most prominent

Agent

The next stage was to investigate whether a
combination of pharmacological agents could target cells
with adaptive TKI resistance in vitro using the H3122
colony formation model. H3122 cells were treated with
TAE684 in combination with another pharmacological
agent (Table 1) for 7 days, after which the drugs were
withdrawn. After regrowth had occurred, the colonies were
fixed and stained. The pharmacological agents were small
molecular inhibitors in use or under investigation as cancer
therapeutics, drugs known to target stem cells or pathways
involved in these, or traditional chemotherapeutic agents.
Surprisingly, only three agents, the PI3K inhibitor
ZSTK474, the BH3 mimetic ABT-263 and the cancer
stem cell-specific drug salinomycin, were able to inhibit
colony formation in combination with TAE684. ZSTK474

treatment alone or in combination with TAE684 did not
alter the ALDH1 expression (Figure 3B), and therefore we
focused our further experiments entirely on the ZSTK474
and salinomycin combinations.
We then set out to investigate how AKT and ERK1/2
signalling activity, the immediate downstream effectors of
PI3K and MEK, alter in H3122 cells treated with TAE684
according to different time schedules. A 5-hour treatment
with TAE684 induced a striking downregulation of
phosphorylated AKT and ERK1/2, but when the treatment
was continued for 5 days the phosphorylation of AKT and
ERK1/2 increased again. The re-activation of AKT could
be abolished by a 5-h treatment with ZSTK474 (Figure
3C). When the H3122 cells were treated with salinomycin
for 5 days, no change in either AKT or ERK was detected,
suggesting that salinomycin inhibits ALDH1-positive cells
downstream of AKT signalling (Figure 3C).
In order to analyze further whether combinations of
the ALK inhibitor with the PI3K inhibitor or salinomycin
behave similarly in short-term assays as they had done
in the longer-exposure experiments such as the colony
formation assay, H3122 cells were exposed to TAE684
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with or without increasing concentrations of ZSTK474
or salinomycin for 72 h and analyzed with a MTS
cytotoxicity assay. The TAE684+ZSTK474 combination
had a synergistic effect in the short-term assay as well, but
the combining of salinomycin with TAE684 did not alter
the toxicity of the therapy (Figure 3D).

Cancer stem cell markers in targeted therapysensitive cell line models
Since TKI treatment of the ALK-translocated
NSCLC H3122 cells induced high expression of
ALDH1 in vitro and increased tumorigenesis in vivo,
it was necessary to ascertain whether this is a general
phenomenon in targeted therapy-sensitive cancer cell
lines. One ALK translocated (H2228), two EGFR mutant
NSCLC lines (PC-9, Ma-1), two HER2-amplified (BT474, SKBR-3) and two ER+ breast cancer lines (MCF7, T-47D), two B-Raf mutant (COLO-800, SK-MEL-1)
and two N-Ras mutant melanoma lines (SK-MEL-30,
IPC-289) were exposed to TAE684, erlotinib, lapatinib,
tamoxifen, vemurafenib and CI-1040, respectively, for

7 days and analyzed for the expression of ALDH1 and
CD44. High endogenous ALDH1 expression was detected
in the HER2-amplified and T-47D breast cancer lines and
in the B-Raf mutant melanoma lines. H2228 was the
only other line to H3122 cells to display any increased
ALDH1 expression in response to targeted therapy. CD44
expression was seen in H2228, all the melanoma lines,
with some increase in expression in SK-MEL-30 and

COLO-800 in response to treatment (Figure 4A).
As the H2228 line increased expression of ALDH1
in response to TKI, we further examined whether this
cell line would behave like the H3122 cells in response
to combined inhibition of ALK with PI3K, MEK or
salinomycin. Single agents had very limited or no
activity on the colony formation while the combination of
TAE684 with ZSTK474 or salinomycin induced marked

inhibition of colony formation (Figure 4B). We further
studied whether the expression of ALDH1 or CD44 was
altered by the combination therapies. In H2228 cells, a
decrease in ALDH1 expression was seen with ZSTK474
and TAE684+ZSTK474 but not with salinomycin
combinations (Figure 4C). Conversely, CD44 expression
remained unaltered with single agents but markedly
downregulated in response TAE684 and ZSTK474 or
salinomycin. We were also anxious to find out whether
cell signalling is altered in the H2228 line in response to
short or long exposures to TAE684. 5 hours of treatment
with TAE684 resulted in complete inhibition of pAKT
signalling, while pERK remained unchanged, but by
5 days marked upregulation of pAKT and pERK/ERK
was detected even though the cells had been subject to
continuous TAE684 treatment. When the cells treated with
TAE684 for 5 days were exposed to ZSTK474 for 5 h,
complete downregulation of pAKT was seen (Figure 4D).
As with H3122 cells, H2228 cells were exposed
to drugs in a MTS cytotoxicity assay in order to analyze

further whether combinations of the ALK inhibitor and
the PI3K inhibitor or salinomycin behave similarly in
short-term assays as they had done in the longer-exposure
colony formation experiments. TAE684 and salinomycin
had no or limited activity by themselves while ZSTK474
showed concentration dependent cytotoxicity. The
TAE684+ZSTK474 combination had a synergistic effect
in the short-term assay as well, but the combination of
salinomycin with TAE684 did not alter the toxicity of the
therapy (Figure 4D).

Adaptive resistance as a factor in the development
of acquired resistance
Since our data suggested that the PI3K inhibitor
and salinomycin can inhibit adaptive resistance in
H3122 cells, we asked whether adaptive resistance
could serve as source of acquired resistance. Long-term
ALK TKI treatment of the H3122 cells has been linked

to the development of acquired resistance by multiple
mechanisms such as the L1196M secondary mutation
and the activation of EGFR/HER2 signalling [22-24]. We
therefore decided to expose H3122 cells to 1μM crizotinib
with or without 3.3μM ZSTK474 or 0.1μM salinomycin,
concentrations previously shown to inhibit adaptive
resistance, and to monitor the cells for the development of
acquired resistance. After a three-month exposure to the
drugs, growing colonies were seen amongst the crizotinibtreated cells (Figure 5A), but visual assessment suggested
that the proliferation rate was lower than in the original

cell line. Conversely, there were no growing colonies
present in either the crizotinib+ZSTK474-treated plates
nor the crizotinib+salinomycin-treated ones (Figure 5A).
We then monitored the combination-treated cells for an
additional three months, but no growing colonies or living
cells remained at the end of the treatment period, and
therefore no further experiments were carried out with
this material.
The resistance mechanism of crizotinib-treated
H3122 cells (H3122CR) was further studied by means of
cytotoxicity and Western blot assays. H3122CR showed

a ~10 fold increase in IC50 concentrations in the MTS
cytotoxicity assays, in response to both crizotinib and
TAE684 as compared with the original line. Furthermore,
the percentage downregulation relative to the controls was
markedly lower in the H3122CR cells with both drugs,
suggesting an increased number of living cells even at
high drug concentrations (Figure 5B). We next exposed the
H3122 and H3122CR cells to increasing concentrations
of crizotinib and TAE684 for 5 h and analyzed the cells
for the phosphorylation of ALK and its downstream
targets AKT and ERK. In both cell lines the lowest
concentration of the both drugs was able to completely
block ALK phosphorylation. Downregulation of AKT
and ERK phosphorylation was seen in both cell lines in
response to either crizotinib or TAE684, but complete
blocking of the signal was seen only in the H3122 cells,
suggesting that the resistance is mediated by the presence
of another activated receptor, tyrosine kinase (RTK)
(Figure 5C). Since EGFR and HER2 have been linked
to ALK TKI resistance, we then set out to see whether
these RTKs could be mediators of acquired resistance in
H3122CR cells. A Western blot assay did not show any
increase in either phosphorylated or total EGFR or HER2
levels in the H3122CR cells relative to the control cells
(not shown), but when the cells were exposed to afatinib,
a dual EGFR and HER2 inhibitor, in combination with
crizotinib, markedly increased cytotoxicity was evident by
comparison with the single agent treatments. Furthermore,
cPARP expression, an indicator of apoptosis, was only
present in H3122CR cells when they were exposed to both
drugs, but not with single agent treatments (Figure 5D).
We also tried to generate colonies of H3122CR cells
to see whether multiple resistance mechanisms occurred
simultaneously in the cell line. However, the H3122CR
lost their acquired resistance, as analyzed by either
cytoxicity or Western blot assays (not shown), during the
colony generation phase. We next withdrew the H3122CR
cells from the crizotinib medium and analyzed them for the
presence of crizotinib resistance by means of cytotoxicity
assays. The cells had retained their resistance after three
and six passages of drug withdrawal, but resistance had
been abolished after nine passages (not shown).

and drug combinations overcoming this form of resistance
using in vitro models.
We investigated adaptive resistance to targeted
cancer therapies with the main aim of ascertaining whether
the cells with CSLS features could play a role in such
resistance. Our findings indicate that increased expression
of CSC markers and in vivo tumorigenesis may occur in
response to targeted therapies at least in some cell lines.
We cannot conclude how general this phenomenon is,
since only two out of the twelve cell lines studied here
presented the same phenomenon. Even though multiple
markers such as CD44, CD133, ALDH1 and EMT have
been linked to the CSLC phenotype, no general marker
for CSCs has been identified [1, 3]. Consequently, the
CSLC phenotype could exist even though we did not
see any change in the markers that we studied. As in
previous works, our study also showed some discordancy
between ALDH1 and CD44 markers in the H2228 line
[1]. Based on our work, it remains unproven whether the
cells with CSLC features exist as a small subpopulation
before initiation of drug treatment or if CSLC markers are
upregulated in response to drug treatment.
Our screening for an agent targeting adaptive
resistance in H3122 cells, an ALK-translocated NSCLC
line, included 28 selected agents which affected the
general signalling pathways, CSLSs, or cytotoxics. Only
three agents were found to inhibit adaptive resistance,
including a PI3K inhibitor, the CSLC-targeting drug
salinomycin and the BH3-mimetic. ZSTK474 and
salinomycin also inhibited expression of the CSC marker
ALDH1, suggesting that cells with CSLS phenotype
could be mediators of adaptive resistance. PI3K inhibitors
alone also possessed cytotoxic activity in H3122 cells in
short-term assays, so that we cannot completely rule out
the possibility that PI3K activity with respect to adaptive
resistance might be partly mediated by increased acute
cytotoxicity rather than stem cell targeting. Salinomycin,
however, is non-cytotoxic in itself, implying that it may
play a role as a CSC targeting agent. Salinomycin was
originally discovered as a CSLS targeting agent in a
~16,000-compound chemical screen which showed it to
be the most selective agent against CSLCs [15]. Previous
works have also linked PI3K-AKT-mTOR signalling with
the CSLC phenotype [25, 26]. In the H3122 and H2228
cells PI3K-AKT signalling activity increased in long-term
(days) ALK TKI exposures after initial downregulation
(hours). H2228, an ALK translocated NSCLC line, has
been shown to have diminished activity with primary
ALK TKIs through unknown mechanism [27]. Current
work suggests that CSLC features might be related to
the primary ALK TKI resistance in H2228 line, which
has basal expression of both ALDH1 and CD44 and
downregulation of latter correlates with cytotoxicity.
Acquired resistance is an important factor limiting
the efficiency of targeted therapies, and one that occurs
in virtually all patients with metastatic disease in the

DISCUSSION
Acquired drug resistance in targeted therapy
sensitive cancers has been a topic of extensive studies.
In solid malignancies, clinical manifestation of acquired
resistance occurs from months to some years after
initiation of the therapy. Adaptive resistance mechanism,
which occur rapidly after therapy initiation, is another
mechanism how cancer cells can avoid targeted drug
induced cell death. Even though adaptive resistance
is largely accepted as a mechanism for targeted drug
resistance, it remains largely an unexplored area. Current
work sheds light on the occurrence, potential mechanisms,

course of time. It can occur through various mechanisms
such as point mutations in the target gene, the activation
of other tyrosine kinases, and EMT [19]. The dominant
theory regarding the development of acquired resistance
is simply Darwinian selection among the drug-resistant
clones initially present in the tumor. Interestingly, a
recent work concerned with vemurafenib resistance has
provided evidence for a knottier background in acquired
resistance. In this model, drug-dependent clones can
mediate resistance and discontinuous dosing of the
drug can forestall this resistance [28]. Our work also
provides evidence for a more complex development of
acquired resistance, since combining drugs that affect
cells with CSLC features in combination with ALK TKI
in the H3122 cells blocked the development of EGFR
and/or HER2 mediated acquired resistance, as has been
described previously in the line [23, 24]. This resistance
was reversible in nature, as characterized previously [23,
24], and therefore we cannot rule out a continuum of
adaptive resistance. However, as we followed the cultures
over time, crizotinib-treated cells remained dormant until
marked proliferation started to occur after three months
of drug exposure. It is possible that resistant clones
become diluted after drug removal because of the slower

proliferation rate and the diminishing of resistance over
time. Diminished acquired resistance has also been shown
to occur in genetic alteration-based acquired resistance
models such as T790M in EGFR-mutant NSCLC [29].
Since the salinomycin-ALK TKI combination blocked
the formation of acquired resistance in the H3122 model,
it is possible that cells with CSLC features can serve as
a source for this form of resistance. PI3K-AKT-mTOR
signalling pathway re-activation is very frequently seen in
acquired resistance, making it possible that the PI3K-ALK
inhibitor combination might prevent acquired resistance
directly rather than through cells with CSLC features..
Traditional CSC models describe a hierarchic
organisation of tumors. Based on hierarchic models, only
CSC targeting would be needed for tumor regression [13]. There is also evidence that stochastic CSC models
which presuppose that tumor cells are plastic with high
rate of bi-directional interconversion between stem
and differentiated states [30]. If the stochastic model
stands, targeting both CSCs and differentiated is needed
for maximal therapeutic efficiency. The results of our
experiments for adaptive resistance in cells with CSLC
features reflect similar stochastic model. In H3122 line,
upregulation of CSC marker ALDH1 by ALK TKI was
seen also after cytotoxic treatment of cells with dual PI3K
and MEK therapy. More importantly, combinatory drug
treatment experiments in H3122 and H2228 lines showed
that CSLC targeting agents had no or limited single agent
activity while their combination with TKI, preferentially
targeting non-CSLCs, increased cytotoxicity (Figure 6).
In conclusion, the current work describes adaptive
resistance to targeted cancer therapies. It also characterizes
drug combinations targeting this form of resistance, and
provides evidence that targeting adaptive resistance can
prevent the later occurrence of acquired resistance. An
understanding of the mechanisms behind resistance can
provide clues for smarter therapeutic approaches, which
can in turn increase the efficiency of cancer therapies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and inhibitors
Figure 6: Schematic Representation of Cancer StemLike Cells and their Targeting with TKI and StemLike Cell Drugs. TKI-sensitive malignant tumors consist

The following cell lines were used: NSCLC lines
H2228, H3122, and PC-9; breast cancer lines BT474,
SKBR3, MCF-7, and T-47D; melanoma lines IPC-298,
SK-MEL30, SK-MEL1, and COLO-800. The NSCLC
cell lines were kind gifts from Dr. Pasi Jänne (DanaFarber Cancer Institute, Boston, USA), breast cancer
lines were from one of us (P.K.) and the melanoma cell
lines were purchased DSMZ GmbH (Braunschweig,
Germany). The H3122 Luc cell line was generated by a
retroviral transfection with a firefly luciferase plasmid
(MSCV-Luc- Puro). All cell lines were grown in RPMI

of differentiated cells (red) and a minor population of cancer
stem-like cells (green). When the tumors are challenged with
TKI, the major tumor response is seen in the preferred target, the
differentiated cells, while the stem-like cells remain unaffected.
It is these remaining stem-like cells that may be responsible
for tumor relapse and acquired resistance. When the tumor is
targeted with a stem-like cell-specific (CSLC) drug, a limited
tumor response is seen because of the stochastic nature of the
cancer stem cell model. The most prominent response is seen
when tumors are targeted concurrently with TKI and a CSLC
drug.

Western blot analysis

Mouse xenograft model

The cells were plated on 6-well plates, allowed to
attach for 1-2 days, and then treated with drugs. After
desired drug treatments, the cells were lysed with NP40
lysis buffer (1% Igepal CA-630, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH
8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM
sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and 10 μg/ml
leupeptin). Protein concentrations of the cell lysates were
measured using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad;
Hercules, CA). After equalizing the protein concentrations
of the samples, 3x Laemmli buffer added, samples were
boiled and stored at -80°C.
Equal amounts of protein samples were separated
on SDS-PAGE and proteins were transferred to PVDF
membrane. The membranes were blocked and then
incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4°C.
Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked antibody was used
as a secondary, the membranes were developed using
chemiluminescense and exposed on radiographic films. All
western blot experiments were performed in duplicates.
The following antibodies were used: ALDH1 (BD
Transduction Laboratories, Franklin Lakes, USA), CD44,
phospho-Akt (S473), Akt, phospho-ERK1/2 (T202/
Y204), ERK1/2, phospho-ALK (T1096), ALK, vimentin,
E-cadherin, and Anti-Mouse/Rabbit HRP-linked antibody
(Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, USA).

H3122 Luc cells were treated with 0.1μM TAE684
for 14 days and let to recover for 1 day before injection.
TAE-untreated H3122 Luc cells were used as controls.
After trypsination, the cells were counted using trypan
blue exclusion, and the cells were diluted with PBS to
100,000 or 10,000 cells/0.2ml and immediately injected
on mice. Female NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid)Hr(hr)/NCrHsd
mice (Harlan Laboratories; Boxmeer, Netherlands)
were anesthetized with fentanyl/fluanisone/midazolam
and 0.2ml of the cell solution was injected on both
flanks. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, injected
intraperitoneally with 15 mg/kg D-luciferin Firefly and
imaged weekly using the IVIS Spectrum in vivo imaging
system with Living Image software (PerkinElmer;
Waltham, USA). The luminescent signal was measured
as radiance (p/sec/cm2/sr). The animal experiments
were performed according to protocols approved by
the Provincial State Office of Southern Finland (license
number ESAVI-5307-04.10.03-2011).

Generation of acquired resistance
H3122 cells were plated on 6-well plates, three
replicate wells per treatment. The cells were exposed to
1μM crizotinib, 3.3μM ZSTK474, 0.1μM salinomycin or
their combination and the plates were visually inspected
under microscope weekly. At three months of exposure
to the drugs, growing colonies were present only in the
crizotinib treated wells when one of three wells were fixed
and stained as for colony formation assays. One of the
crizotinib resistant wells (H3122CR cells) was trypsinized
and the cells were transferred to non-drug containing
media. After a single passage cells were 1) analyzed with
western blot and MTS-assays, 2) plated on 96-well plates
on average one cell per well to generate clones, or 3) let to
grow in non-drug media and analyzed with MTS assay for
presence of resistance every three passages. Combination
treated wells were followed for additional three months.
After six months, the experiment was terminated since
there were no surviving cells.

Colony formation assay
300-1300 cells were plated on 24-well plates and
treated with drugs for 7 days in multible parallel wells.
After 7 days, the drugs were withdrawn and the cells were
allowed to proliferate and form colonies for several weeks.
After differences in the growth of colonies had appeared,
the cells were fixed with methanol and dyed with crystal
violet stain.

MTS cytotoxicity assay
In the MTS assay, 5,000-12,000 cells were plated
into 96-well plates and treated with drugs and their
combinations for 72 hours. Three to six parallel wells
for each treatment were used and untreated cells were
used as a control. After the drug treatments, the cells
