Kidney cancer is not a single disease; it is comprised of several different types of cancer, each with a different histology, with a different clinical course, caused by a different gene, and responding differently to
therapy. The VHL gene is the gene for the hereditary cancer syndrome, von Hippel-Lindau, as well as for
the common form of sporadic, noninherited, clear cell kidney cancer. Understanding the VHL-hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathway has provided the foundation for the development of several agents targeting this
pathway, such as sunitinib, sorafenib, and temsirolimus. Hereditary papillary renal carcinoma (HPRC) is a hereditary renal cancer syndrome in which affected individuals are at risk for the development of bilateral, multifocal, type 1 papillary renal cell carcinoma. The genetic defect underlying HPRC is MET, the cell surface
receptor for hepatocyte growth factor. Mutations of MET also have been identified in a subset of tumors from
patients with sporadic type 1 papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Clinical trials targeting the MET pathway
are currently underway in patients with HPRC and in patients with sporadic (nonhereditary) papillary kidney
cancer. The BHD gene (also known as folliculin or FLCN) is the gene for Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, an autosomal-dominant genodermatosis associated with a hereditary form of chromophobe and oncocytic, hybrid RCC.
Preclinical studies are underway targeting the BHD gene pathway in preparation for clinical trials in BirtHogg-Dube and sporadic chromophobe RCC. Patients with hereditary leiomyomatosis RCC (HLRCC) are at
risk for developing cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas and a very aggressive type of RCC. HLRCC is characterized by germline mutation of the Krebs cycle enzyme, fumarate hydratase (FH). Studies of the tricarboxylic
acid cycle and the VHL-HIF pathways have provided the foundation for therapeutic approaches in patients
with HLRCC-associated kidney cancer as well as other hereditary and sporadic forms of RCC. Cancer

Targeting Kidney Cancer Gene Pathways/Linehan et al

Kidney cancer is not a single disease; it is comprised
of several different types of cancer that occur in the kidney. Each of these cancers has a different histology and
clinical course, responds differently to therapy, and is
caused by a different gene mutation.3,4
Inherited Forms of Kidney Cancer
Kidney cancer is similar to other cancers, such as prostate,
colon, and breast cancers, in that it occurs in both sporadic
(nonfamilial) and hereditary forms. Study of families with
specific types of inherited kidney cancer has led to the identification of 4 high-risk susceptibility genes for kidney cancer and has provided the foundation for the development of
therapies that target these cancer gene pathways.5 There are
4 well described types of inherited kidney cancer: 1) von
Hippel-Lindau (VHL), the inherited form of clear cell renal
cell carcinoma (RCC); 2) hereditary papillary RCC
(HPRC), the hereditary form of type 1 papillary RCC; 3)
Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD), the inherited form of chromophobe, oncocytic hybrid RCC, and 4) hereditary leiomyomatosis RCC (HLRCC) (Fig. 1).
von Hippel-Lindau: Inherited Form of Clear
Cell Kidney Cancer—VHL Gene
VHL is an inherited form of kidney cancer in which
affected individuals are at risk for the development of
tumors in several organs, including bilateral, multifocal
clear cell kidney cancers6; pancreatic cysts and neuroendocrine tumors7; pheochromocytoma8; retinal angiomas9;
central nervous system (CNS) hemangioblastomas10; and
tumors in the inner ear (endolymphatic sac tumors).11
Patients with VHL are at risk of developing of up to 600
tumors per kidney.6 The goal of surgical management for
VHL-associated kidney tumors is to prevent metastasis
while preserving renal function. An approach has been
developed to recommend surgical removal of renal
tumors12-17 with partial nephrectomy when the largest
tumor reaches 3 cm in size.18 The use of laparoscopic partial nephrectomy as well as robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy17 has the potential to reduce morbidity significantly
for patients with VHL-associated renal tumors (Fig. 2).

VHL gene mutation is identified consistently in the germline of affected patients.20 The VHL gene is also the gene
for the common form of sporadic, nonhereditary, clear
cell kidney cancer.21,22 The VHL protein forms a complex
with other proteins and targets the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. HIF is a
transcription factor that drives the downstream expression
of several growth and proangiogenic factors that are important in cancer, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor-a, plateletderived growth factor (PDGF), and the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR). When the VHL gene is mutated,
both in patients with VHL and in patients with clear cell
RCC, the VHL complex cannot degrade HIF, and HIF
accumulates. The result is increased levels of VEGF,
PDGF, EGFR, and other downstream factors in clear cell
RCC.

Hereditary Non-von Hippel-Lindau Clear
Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma
Several families have been reported in which affected individuals bearing a balanced, constitutional translocation of
a segment of chromosome 3 (to chromosome 8,23 chromosome 6,24 or chromosome 225) are at risk for the
development of bilateral, multifocal clear cell kidney
cancer. This represents an example of a ‘‘3-hit’’ model of
kidney cancer in which the first alteration is the germline
balanced translocation of chromosome 3, the second alteration is somatic loss of the chromosome 3 translocate
(bearing 1 copy of the VHL gene), and the third alteration
is the somatic mutation of the sole remaining allele of the
VHL gene.26 Clear cell kidney cancer in the chromosome
3 translocation families tends to be later onset than in
VHL, most likely because of the requirement for 3 events
(non-VHL familial clear cell RCC) versus the need for 2
mutations in VHL. In a non-VHL family in which multiple members are affected with clear cell kidney cancer, a
germline karyotype is recommended to rule out the possibility of a chromosome 3 translocation.

FIGURE 1. Kidney cancer is comprised of several different types of cancer, each with a different histologic type, with a different
clinical course, responding differently to therapy, and caused by different genes. The VHL gene is the gene for von Hippel-Lindau
and for sporadic clear cell kidney cancer. The MET proto-oncogene is the gene for hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma and
reportedly is mutated in a subset of type 1 papillary renal tumors (13%).37 The fumarate hydratase (FH) gene is the gene for hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma; to our knowledge, the genetic basis of sporadic, type 2 papillary kidney cancer
remains to be determined. The BHD gene is the gene for the hereditary form of chromophobe kidney cancer and oncocytoma
associated with Birt-Hogg-Dube. BHD gene mutations have been identified in sporadic chromophobe kidney cancer66; however,
the primary genetic basis of sporadic chromophobe kidney cancer and oncocytomas remains to be determined. Reproduced

FIGURE 2. The VHL gene is the gene for clear cell kidney cancer. The VHL protein targets hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) for
ubiquitin-mediated degradation. (A) When the VHL gene is mutated in clear cell kidney cancer, the VHL protein cannot target
and degrade HIF. HIF overaccumulates and causes increased transcription of downstream genes, such as vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). (B) Future approaches could include agents that target HIF
directly. (C) Current therapeutic approaches include antibodies, such as bevacizumab, that target VEGF, as well as agents, such
as sunitinib and sorafenib, that target the VEGF and PDGF receptors. RCC indicates renal cell carcinoma; CUL2, cullin 2; Rbx1,

the treatment of patients with advanced kidney cancer. In
a phase 3 randomized study in patients with untreated
metastatic clear cell RCC, treatment with sunitinib
resulted in superior progression-free survival and overall
survival compared with interferon. Sunitinib, a tyrosine
kinase inhibitor (TKI) that targets the VEGF and PDGF
receptors, has been associated with nearly a 35% response
rate in patients with advanced clear cell RCC and with
increased progression-free survival over interferon.27,28
Sorafenib, another TKI that targets the VEGF and PDGF
receptors as well as Raf, produced partial response rates
that ranged from 2% to 10% and, in patients with cytokine-refractory disease, demonstrated a doubling of the
time to progression versus placebo.29 The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, temsirolimus, which
indirectly targets the VHL pathway by inhibiting the transcription of HIF, produced a partial response rate of 9%
in patients with advanced clear cell kidney cancer and
increased progression-free survival and overall survival
versus interferon in patients with advanced RCC who
demonstrated 3 predefined ‘‘poor prognosis’’ features.30
Although to our knowledge there are few reported complete responses with these agents, and most patients eventually develop progressive disease, these initial approaches
offer proof of principle of the efficacy of targeting the
VHL pathway in VHL/ clear cell kidney cancer.

Hereditary Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma:
Type 1 Kidney Cancer—MET Gene
Hereditary papillary renal carcinoma (HPRC) is a hereditary cancer syndrome in which affected individuals are at
risk for the development of bilateral, multifocal, type 1
papillary RCC.31 To identify the HPRC gene, families
were studied and genetic linkage analyses were performed
to localize the HPRC gene to the long arm of chromosome 7. Subsequently, the MET gene was identified as the
gene for HPRC.32 The MET gene encodes the cell surface
receptor for hepatocyte growth factor. MET is a protooncogene; previously identified HPRC-associated mutations constitutively activate the tyrosine kinase domain of
MET. HPRC is autosomal dominant and highly penetrant; ie, affected individuals are highly likely to develop
bilateral, multifocal, papillary kidney cancer.33 HPRC
kidney cancer is uniformly type 1 papillary RCC34; the
estimated prevalence of renal tumors is 1100 to 3400
Cancer

microscopic papillary tumors in a single kidney.35
Although HPRC is typically late onset (age of onset in the
fifth, sixth, and seventh decades), an early onset form
recently has been described in which the disease appears in
the second and third decades.36 MET gene mutations also
have been detected in a subset of tumors from patients
with sporadic, type 1 papillary RCC.37

Clinical Evaluation of Patients With
Bilateral, Multifocal, Papillary Renal Cell
Carcinoma
Germline MET mutation analysis is recommended for
patients with bilateral, multifocal papillary RCC as well as
for those with a family history of type 1 papillary RCC.
Family history should be obtained, although this disease
can be occult and late onset. Imaging assessment includes
contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic
resonance imaging studies. HPRC renal tumors typically
are relatively hypovascular, enhance uniformly, and grow
slowly. Computed tomography is preferable to ultrasound
for screening, because ultrasound easily can miss HPRC
tumors.38

Clinical Management of Patients With
Hereditary Papillary Renal Carcinoma
HPRC kidney cancers tend to be occult and, if not
detected and treated, can spread to other organs. Parenchymal sparing surgery (partial nephrectomy) is recommended when the largest renal tumor approaches 3 cm in
size. Patients who have tumors <3 cm generally are managed with observation.13,39 The goal of management is to
maintain the patient’s renal function while minimizing
the risk for metastasis.

Systemic Therapy: Targeting MET
in Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma
There are several potential approaches to targeting the
MET gene pathway that currently are under study. One
approach involves the use of TKIs that target the tyrosine
kinase domain of MET. Other approaches include antibodies that target hepatocyte growth factor, the ligand of
the MET cell surface receptor, or antibodies that target
the extracellular domain of MET and inactivate the
2255

receptor. A phase 2 study of the dual MET-VEGF receptor 2 TKI GSK1363089 (formerly XL880) in patients
with papillary RCC currently is underway and is the first
trial to evaluate MET inhibition in this disease. In an
interim analysis of that clinical trial, GSK1363089 demonstrated antitumor efficacy in patients with papillary
kidney cancer.40

Birt-Hogg-Dube: Chromophobe Kidney
Cancer—BHD Gene
Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD) is an inherited renal cancer syndrome in which affected individuals are at risk for the development of cutaneous lesions (fibrofolliculoma)41;
pulmonary cysts and spontaneous pneumothorax; and
bilateral, multifocal kidney cancer.42 In describing the
renal tumors in BHD patients, Pavlovich et al observed
that 44 of 130 tumors (34%) were chromophobe kidney
cancer, 50% were hybrid oncocytic tumors (areas reminiscent of chromophobe kidney cancer as well as oncocytomas), and 9% were clear cell RCC. Approximately 58%
of their patients had microscopic oncocytosis identified in
the remaining, macroscopically normal renal parenchyma.43 In that study, the size of the tumors at presentation was correlated with the increasing malignant
potential of the histologic type. Hybrid tumors averaged
2.2 cm in size, chromophobe renal carcinomas averaged
3 cm in greatest dimension, and clear cell renal carcinomas averaged 4.7 cm. These various histologies can be
observed in the same family, in the same patient, and
sometimes even in the same kidney. In 1 patient, 2 oncocytomas, 7 hybrid tumors, chromophobe renal carcinomas, and 1 clear cell renal carcinoma were identified. Less
than 15% of that patient’s kidney was unaffected by
tumor nodules.43 In an initial report of 127 patients from
45 BHD families who were screened at the National Cancer Institute, 27% had renal tumors identified.44 Because
of the bilateral, multifocal nature of BHD-associated kidney cancer, a management approach involving observation of small tumors until they reach 3 cm in size often is
recommended.44 When surgical intervention is recommended, an attempt is made to remove all or most of the
visible tumors. Although surgical management is not
considered ‘‘curative’’ for BHD-associated RCC, BHDassociated renal tumors often are slow growing, and only
infrequently are multiple surgical procedures required
2256

during a patient’s lifetime to control the tumor burden
and prevent the development of metastasis.
Identification of the BHD Gene
To identify the susceptibility gene for BHD syndrome,
affected individuals and their family members were evaluated by a multidisciplinary team in the Clinical Center at
the National Institutes of Health. Genetic linkage analysis
was performed, and the BHD gene was localized45 and
then identified on the short arm of chromosome 17.46
Sequence analysis of the BHD gene (also known as folliculin [FLCN]) in the germline of affected individuals from
BHD families has identified mutation of this gene in nearly
90% of affected families.46,47 A Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments genetic test is available for
individuals or families who are at risk for BHD syndrome.
BHD (FLCN) Gene Function
When BHD was identified, it was a novel gene with an
unknown function. Subsequent studies that have identified binding partners to the protein product of the BHD
gene (FLCN)48,49 have placed this gene in a pathway
involving AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), serine/
threonine protein kinase LKB1, tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1)/TSC2, and mTOR. Those studies suggested that FLCN may be involved in nutrient and/or
energy sensing through the AMPK/mTOR pathway.48
Vocke et al evaluated 77 renal tumors from 12
patients who had germline mutations of the BHD gene by
DNA sequencing to identify somatic mutations in the second (wild-type) copy of the gene.50 Mutations or loss of
heterozygosity of the second allele was identified in 70%
of renal tumors, suggesting that BHD is a loss-of-function, tumor suppressor gene.
Targeting the BHD Gene Pathway
To asses the phenotypic effect of BHD gene mutations in
the kidney and to provide a model for the evaluation of
potential molecular therapeutic approaches for the treatment of BHD syndrome, a kidney-targeted BHD knockout mouse model was developed by Baba et al.51 In that
rodent model, the BHD knockout mice developed
enlarged, polycystic kidneys and died of renal failure at a
very early age. Treatment with rapamycin had a

significant impact on reducing the kidney size and
increasing the median survival of the animals.51 Those
studies provide the foundation for a potential therapeutic
approach to BHD-associated kidney cancer.

Hereditary Leiomyomatosis Renal Cell
Carcinoma: The Fumarate Hydratase Gene
Hereditary Leiomyomatosis Renal Cell Carcinoma
(HLRCC) is a hereditary cancer syndrome in which
affected individuals are at risk for the development of
cutaneous and uterine leiomyomas and kidney cancer.52
Cutaneous leiomyomas most often are present on the
trunk or extremities. The lesions often are unilateral, and
from 10 to 100 have been observed in a single individual.
Most patients will experience pain or paresthesia in association with these lesions. A high percentage of women
(nearly 100%) who either have cutaneous leiomyoma or
are fumarate hydratase (FH) mutation carriers develop
uterine leiomyomas (fibroids). The uterine leiomyomas
often are multiple and early onset; a high percentage of
affected individuals reported hysterectomy or myomectomy in their 20s.53 Cutaneous and uterine leiomyosarcoma have been reported rarely.53,54

Hereditary Leiomyomatosis Renal Cell
Carcinoma-associated Kidney Cancer
HLRCC-associated kidney cancer is an aggressive form of
kidney cancer that has a predisposition to metastasize
early.55 The morphologic spectrum of HLRCC is unique
and may be tubulopapillary, solid, often with microcystic
features. The most notable histologic features may include
the presence of large nuclei with prominent orangiophilic
nucleoli.56 The histologic pattern can be suggestive of either type 2 papillary kidney cancer or collecting duct carcinoma. In a patient with a ‘‘collecting duct carcinoma’’ or
‘‘type 2 papillary kidney cancer’’ who has a family history
of early onset uterine leiomyomas or cutaneous leiomyomas, HLRCC should be considered in the differential diagnosis. HLRCC patients are at risk for developing renal
cysts and tumors that appear to develop either independently or within the renal cysts. The renal carcinomas can
be early onset and infrequently are bilateral and multifocal. When HLRCC renal tumors are detected, early surgical intervention is strongly recommended.
Cancer

May 15, 2009

Fumarate Hydratase: The Hereditary
Leiomyomatosis Renal Cell Carcinoma Gene
The susceptibility gene for HLRCC encodes the Krebs
cycle enzyme, FH.57 Mutations of the FH gene have been
detected in >90% of HLRCC kindreds.53,58 Loss of heterozygosity is observed frequently in HLRCC-associated
kidney cancers,52,56 suggesting that the FH gene has the
characteristics of a tumor suppressor gene. In patients
who have a history of multiple cutaneous leiomyomas
and/or early onset uterine leiomyomas, germline FH
mutation analysis often is recommended.55 Isaacs et al
demonstrated a novel mechanism whereby the inactivation of FH was associated with a VHL-independent dysregulation of HIF, providing the foundation for a potential
therapeutic approach to the treatment of HLRCC-associated kidney cancer.59 Further studies are underway to
understand the relation between dysregulation of the
Krebs cycle and tumorigenesis and the role of FH mutation in RCC.
Hereditary Paraganglioma/
Pheochromocytoma
Hereditary paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma, an autosomal-dominant hereditary condition in which affected
individuals are at risk for the development of pheochromocytoma and extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas (paragangliomas) (PGL), is characterized by germline
mutation of 3 of the 4 genes that encode the Krebs cycle
gene, succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB),
SDHC, and SDHD.60,61 In 2004. Vanharanta et al identified kidney cancer as a component of the hereditary
PGL complex.61 Recently, Ricketts et al reported 3
patients with either early onset or bilateral, multifocal
clear cell or chromophobe renal carcinoma who had germline mutations of SDHB.62 In patients with early onset or
bilateral, multifocal clear cell or chromophobe kidney
cancer, consideration should be given to succinate dehydrogenase germline mutation testing.
Tuberous Sclerosis Complex
TSC is a hereditary condition in which affected individuals are at risk for the development of several manifestations, including bilateral, multifocal renal lesions.
Whereas most TSC renal lesions are angiomyolipoma,
2257

Original Article

RCC has been reported in 1% to 3% of individuals with
TSC.63 The predominant management issue with TSCassociated angiomyolipoma revolves around the potential
for spontaneous hemorrhage. Most clinicians manage
TSC-associated renal angiomyolipomas with observation,
surgical removal, or embolization. The management
approach depends on the size and location of the tumor
and the concern about the potential for spontaneous hemorrhage. Many clinicians recommend emoblization of
TSC-associated renal angiomyolipomas, particularly
those that measure >4 cm to 8 cm in size.63,64 In a recent
report of an open-label, phase 1/2 trial of sirolimus in
patients with TSC or the related condition, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, treatment with sirolimus, which suppresses mTOR signaling, was associated with a reduction
of angiomyolipoma volume of 30% in 5 patients on the
study.65

Summary
Understanding the genetic basis of kidney cancer has provided the foundation for the development of therapeutic
approaches targeting the kidney cancer genes. Encouraging progress has been made with agents such as sunitinib,
sorafenib. and temsirolimus targeting the VHL gene pathway in clear cell kidney cancer. Studies currently are
underway evaluating the role of agents that target the
MET gene, in both HPRC and in sporadic, noninherited
papillary RCC. Encouraging preclinical studies have provided a basis for potential therapeutic trials in BHD-associated kidney cancer as well as chromophobe renal
carcinoma. Study of the FH pathway has provided an
approach to the treatment of HLRCC-associated kidney
cancer that also may be of benefit to patients with
nonfamilial type 2 papillary kidney cancer. Knowledge of
the mutations and pathways underlying each form of
RCC has enabled the development of targeted approaches
to treat the various types of kidney cancer, both hereditary
and sporadic.

OPEN DISCUSSION
The questions and discussion below follow from the oral
presentation given at the Third Cambridge Conference on
Innovations and Challenges in Renal Cancer and do not
2258

correspond directly to the written article, which is a more
general review.
Dr. Michael Atkins: Dr. Linehan, in your longterm treatment protocols, have you seen any chronic side
effects, any other problems in other organs, or any resistance that develops in the kidney tumors?
Dr. W. Marston Linehan: Our longest experience
is about 12 months. People with localized disease do not
like being on the drug this long. They can develop diarrhea and fatigue, and it is inconvenient.
Dr. Atkins: Do you see any changes in the other
aspects of these hereditary diseases besides those that you
described within the kidney tumors?
Dr. Linehan: For hereditary papillary renal carcinoma, they only get kidney tumors. For VHL, we are evaluating response in retinal, CNS, pancreatic, as well as
kidney lesions.
Dr. Robert Figlin: Kidney cancer actually falls into
the paradigm of many other diseases that are EGFR overexpressing without TKI benefit.
Dr. William Kaelin: That is right, and you could
argue even at the extreme that EGFR overexpression in
kidney cancer is an epiphenomenon. That is why I come
back to the experiments of Stephen Lee, which were carefully done and well controlled. They suggested that if you
inhibit this pathway in these cells, they do not form
tumors, at least in mice. This is just 1 of those examples
where the mouse model might be misleading, and there is
something going on in humans that we do not
understand.
Dr. Linehan: It also could be that a different agent
targeting EGFR would have a different effect.
Dr. Figlin: But without VEGF receptor inhibition
or VEGF inhibition, the only thing that 6474
(AZD6474, an agent which targets the VEGF and EGF
receptor) answers in my mind is whether receptor and receptor inhibition is somehow different from ligand and
receptor inhibition because otherwise, we know the answer to that question. It does not help.
Dr. Linehan: As we enter the era of combination
therapy, it is at least formally possible that EGFR inhibitor as monotherapy might have little activity. However, in
combination with some of these other active agents, you
could see a response by blocking EGFR signaling.
Dr. Gary Hudes: Is there a difference in renal carcinomas in patients with VHL germline mutation tumors
Cancer

May 15, 2009

Targeting Kidney Cancer Gene Pathways/Linehan et al

versus sporadic alterations in terms of responsiveness to
the currently available VEGF and VEGF receptordirected therapies?
Dr. Linehan: We do not know. Genotypically, they
are identical. There are not that many people with metastatic VHL who have been treated with systemic agents.
Dr. Figlin: Do you have a series of patients with
VHL in whom you have genotyped the metastases as well
as the primary tumor so that you know that the genetic
abnormality in the metastases was exactly the same as the
genetic abnormality in the primary tumor?
Dr. Linehan: Yes, we have. For VHL, it was.
