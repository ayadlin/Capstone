ABSTRACT
Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a dominantly inherited autosomal disease
characterized by schwannomas of the 8th cranial nerve. The NF2 tumor suppressor
gene encodes for Merlin, a protein implicated as a suppressor of multiple cellular
signaling pathways. To identify potential drug targets in NF2-associated malignancies
we assessed the consequences of inhibiting the tyrosine kinase receptor MET. We
identified crizotinib, a MET and ALK inhibitor, as a potent inhibitor of NF2-null Schwann
cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. To identify the target/s of crizotnib
we employed activity-based protein profiling (ABPP), leading to identification of
FAK1 (PTK2) as the relevant target of crizotinib inhibition in NF2-null schwannoma
cells. Subsequent studies confirm that inhibition of FAK1 is sufficient to suppress
tumorigenesis in animal models of NF2 and that crizotinib-resistant forms of FAK1
can rescue the effects of treatment. These studies identify a FDA approved drug as
a potential treatment for NF2 and delineate the mechanism of action in NF2-null
Schwann cells.

INTRODUCTION

have demonstrated that Merlin functions as an inhibitor
of the group I p21-activated kinases (PAKs), by direct
inhibition and by inhibition of the small G-protein Rac1,
a direct upstream activator of the PAKs [5–8]. Previous
studies have shown that the p21-activated kinase 1
(PAK1) activates MET signaling and that disruption of
this activity inhibits PAK1-driven anchorage-independent
cell growth [9]. This is especially significant in the case
of NF2, as previous work has established the PAKs as
necessary effectors and targets for inhibition in NF2
[6, 10]. These findings implicate MET as a potential target
for therapeutic inhibition in the context of NF2 loss. We
therefore set out to determine whether MET inhibition
would be beneficial in a model of NF2-associated
schwannoma.
Towards this goal we employed pharmacologic
and genetic approaches to inhibit MET and identified the
FDA approved drug crizotinib (PF-2341066), as a potent
inhibitor of tumor progression and cellular proliferation of
NF2-null Schwann cells. Moreover, our studies establish
the inhibition of FAK1 (PTK2) as the primary mechanism

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a dominantly
inherited autosomal disease (affecting 1 in 30,000),
attributed to the loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) of the
NF2 gene. The disease is characterized mainly by
development of Schwann cell tumors of the eighth cranial
nerve. Mutations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the
NF2 locus have also been detected at high frequency in
various tumors of the nervous system, including sporadic
schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas [1]. The
NF2 tumor suppressor gene encodes a 69-kDa protein
called Merlin (Moesin, ezrin, and radixin like protein),
implicated in the regulation of a number of the Rac1,
Ras/MAPK, mTOR and Hippo signaling pathways  [2].
Previous studies have demonstrated that Merlin interacts
with CD44 and inhibits signaling through the MET
proto-oncogene, a receptor tyrosine kinase [3]. In
addition, analysis of NF2-null vestibular schwannomas
demonstrated dysregulation of MET expression and
other associated genes [4]. Moreover, several studies

tolerated and is currently being evaluated in clinical trials
in pediatric settings, our findings provide a strong rationale
for assessing this drug in NF2 patients.

crizotinib treated mice displayed a significantly slower
tumor growth rate (Figure 2A–2B). After 24 days of
treatment the animals were sacrificed and the tumors
removed and weighed. Comparison of the cohorts
demonstrates a significantly lower average tumor weight
in the crizotinib-treated group compared to control group
(Figure 2C). Taken together, these data demonstrate
that crizotinib has significant anti-proliferative activity
against NF2-null Schwann cells in vitro and anti-tumor
activity in vivo.

RESULTS
Crizotinib inhibits schwannoma cell
proliferation and tumor formation in vivo
As previous studies implicated signaling downstream
of MET as a potential therapeutic target in vestibular
schwannoma [3, 4], we assessed the consequences of
inhibiting MET in NF2-null Schwann cells. HEI193
cells (NF2-null, derived from a schwannoma of an NF2
patient), SC4 cells (Nf2-null mouse cells) and hSC2lshNF2 cells (hSC2l cells – immortalized normal human
Schwann cells with stable knockdown of  NF2) were
treated with crizotinib (PF-2341066), a FDA approved
drug that is a potent inhibitor of MET, ALK and Ros-1
[11]. Treatment of these cells resulted in a dose-dependent
reduction in cell numbers over a period of 72 hours
(Figure 1A–1C). To more accurately assess the inhibitory
activity of crizotinib, we performed dose-response
studies and established the EC50s as 54 nM and 230 nM
in SC4 or HEI193 cells, respectively (Figure 1D–1E).
To determine if the effects of crizotinib are due to
reduced cell proliferation or increased cell death rates, we
assessed BrdU incorporation in treated SC4 cells. BrdU
incorporation was significantly reduced over 72-hours,
indicating that crizotinib has a strong effect on cellular
proliferation (Figure 1F). To assess the potential effects
of crizotinib on cell death, we examined the status of a
number of apoptotic markers in the treated cells. We did
not observe any differences in levels of cleaved Caspase-3,
Caspase-7 and PARP between SC4 cells treated with
crizotinib or vehicle only (not shown). These data suggest
the effects of crizotinib are mediated primarily through
inhibition of cell proliferation.
To assess if crizotinib can inhibit tumor growth
in vivo, we employed an orthotopic model of NF2
that recapitulates the tumor microenvironment of
schwannomas, by injection of luciferase-tagged NF2-null
SC4 cells into a myelinated nerve [12, 13]. In this
model, tumors are first allowed to form and only then
treatment is commenced. Beginning at 3 days post
surgery, tumor progression was monitored every three
days by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and total flux
counts were recorded for each animal. Ten days post
injection, similar flux readings for all animals were
validated and animals were then enrolled randomly
into control (vehicle only) or drug-treated cohorts and
were treated (100 mg/kg, IP, once daily) for a period
of 24 days. Analysis of the flux reading for the animals
in the cohorts indicated the trends of tumor growth are
significantly different between the cohorts and that

MET is dispensable for NF2-null schwann cell
proliferation
To determine whether the effects of crizotinib
are mediated through inhibition of MET, we employed
pharmacological and genetic approaches to target MET
more precisely. HEI193 or SC4 cells were treated with
capmatinib (INC280), a potent MET inhibitor with
reported average IC50 of 0.13 nmol/L. INC280 is highly
selective towards MET and at 2 μmol/L exhibited 30% or
less inhibition against a panel of 57 structurally diverse
kinases [14]. Treatment of SC4 or HEI193 cells with doses
of up to 10 mM and up to 72 hours had negligible effects
on the proliferation of treated cells compared to controls
(Supplementary Figure S1A–1B). To assess the requirement
for MET directly, genome editing using the CRISPR/
Cas9 system was used to inactivate both MET alleles in
SC4 cells, generating SC4MET(−) cells (Supplementary
Figure S1C). Inactivation of MET had a minimal effect on
the proliferation of SC4MET(−) cells compared to controls
(Supplementary Figure S1D). Similar results were obtained
using 2 independent siRNA oligos to knockdown the
expression of MET (Not shown). Finally, treatment of
SC4MET(−) cells with crizotinib resulted in nearly identical
activity compared to SC4 cells, suggesting the activity
of crizotinib was not mediated through MET inhibition
(Supplementary Figure S1D).

Crizotinib inhibits a broad spectrum of kinases
in NF2-null schwannoma cells
As the anti-proliferative effects of crizotinib on
SC4 and HEI193 do not appear to be mediated through
inhibition of MET, we applied a combination of unbiased
approaches to identify the relevant targets. First,
we examined the expression of kinases in SC4 cells
through unbiased RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) reads.
The normalized read-counts of all annotated kinases
revealed a broad pattern of expression of kinases from
all families. Interestingly, the typical targets of crizotinib
ALK and Ros-1 do not appear to be expressed in SC4
cells (Figure 3A and Supplementary Table S1). Western
blot analysis of protein extracts from SC4 and HEI193
to assess the expression of ALK and Ros-1 confirmed
the lack of expression (not shown). To identify the
kinases inhibited by crizotinib we employed activity54516

Crizotinib’s anti- proliferative activity is
mediated by inhibition of FAK1/PTK2

based protein profiling (ABPP). Briefly, we used an
affinity column composed of multiple kinase inhibitors
conjugated to Sepharose beads. This Multiplexed
Inhibitor Bead (MIB) matrix provides the capability to
capture > 85% of known protein kinases. The kinases
were then eluted from the MIB matrix and identified and
quantitated by mass spectrometry. This approach allowed
us to compare multiple samples in a single run [15, 16].
Comparison of the kinases captured by the MIB matrix
to the RNA-seq expression data indicates the matrix
captured the vast majority of kinases expressed (at least
at the transcriptional level) in the SC4 cells (Figure 3B).
We next treated SC4 cells with crizotinib and
collected cells at 0′, 30′, 240′ and 24 hours post treatment.
Protein extracts from the different time points were
analyzed by ABPP, as described above, and levels of
captured kinases were assessed over time. The binding to
crizotinib should prevent binding of an inhibited kinase to
the MIB matrix and therefore levels of the kinase in treated
fractions will be decreased (Supplementary Table S2).
We applied the following criteria to identify targets of
crizotinib that might mediate the effects observed in SC4
cells: First, target displays > 2 fold reduction relative to
untreated cells and, second, the reduction is sustained up
to 24 hours. Applying these selection criteria resulted in
the identification of 10 kinases: NUAK1, NDKM, PLK4,
TESK1, ATR, SLK, PTK2, PTK2B, EPHA2 and STK10
(Figure 3C).

Although the ABPP identified at least ten potential
candidates for crizotinib’s activity, given the previous
reports correlating NF2 deficiency to sensitivity of
FAK1 inhibition [17, 18] we focused initially on FAK1
as the potential relevant crizotinib target in NF2-null
schwannoma cells. To confirm that indeed crizotinib
inhibits FAK1 in SC4 and HEI193 cells we treated the cells
and assessed FAK1 activation by western blot analysis
using a phospho-specific antibody against FAK-Y397,
which is phosphorylated in activated FAK1. As expected,
treatment with crizotinib resulted in decreased FAK-Y397
phosphorylation indicating it inhibits the activation of
FAK1 in these cells (Figure 4A). To determine if FAK1
is required for proliferation of SC4 or HEI193 cells we
employed shRNA or siRNA, respectively, to knockdown
expression of FAK1 in these cells. Indeed, the knockdown
of FAK1 significantly impaired the proliferation of these
cells (Figure 4B–4C). In addition, we examined the effects
of treating SC4 or HEI193 cells with small-molecule
FAK1 inhibitors. Treatment of SC4 or HEI193 cells with
defactinib (VS6303) or PND-1186 (VS-4718) significantly
impaired cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 4D and not shown).

and is required for the proliferation of these cells, we
sought to confirm these observations through gain of
function approaches. Towards this aim, we first identified
ALK mutations previously shown to confer a decreased
sensitivity to crizotinib and assessed their conservation
in FAK1. Mutations at residue S1206, located at the
solvent front of the kinase domain, and at G1269, located
in proximity to the DFG motif, have been suggested to
diminish the affinity of ALK to crizotinib and facilitate
cell survival in response to treatment [19, 20]. Both
S1206 and G1269 are located in regions of ALK that are
highly conserved in FAK1 with the equivalent residues
at Serine 509 and Glycine 563, respectively (Figure 5A).
We thus generated stable SC4 cells expressing FAK1wt,
FAK1S509R, FAK1G563S and FAK1S509R/G563S and assessed
the expression levels and activity of the different FAK1
alleles. The expression levels of FAK1 are similar for
the wild type and mutated alleles as are the levels of
activation, as determined by phosphorylation of the
Y397 autophosphorylation site (Figure 5B). To determine

whether the mutated alleles confer resistance to crizotinib
we assessed the EC50s for SC4 cells stably expressing
the different alleles. In a similar manner to what has
been previously reported for ALK, the FAK1 S509R,
G563S and S509R/G563S alleles conferred resistance to
crizotinib treatment. While expression of wild type FAK1
increased the EC50 by 2-fold, the expression of the mutated
FAK1 alleles shifted the EC50 by an order of magnitude
(Figure 5C). Thus, the results from both loss- and gain-offunction experiments strongly implicate FAK1 inhibition
as the main mechanism through which crizotinib mediates
its effects in NF2-null schwannoma cells.

DISCUSSION
In spite of more than 2 decades of research
into the molecular basis of NF2, treatment options
are still lacking. Current treatment options are antisymptomatic, are limited to radiation or surgery
and associated with severe morbidity. In an effort

to identify suitable therapeutic targets, we initially
focused on the MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor, based
on previous reports implicating it as a potential target
[3, 4, 9]. While our findings indicate MET is mostly
dispensable for the proliferation of NF2-null Schwann
cells, our efforts identified crizotinib (Xalkori®- Pfizer)
as a having significant anti-proliferative activity both
in vitro and in vivo. Crizotinib was developed as an ATPcompetitive inhibitor of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase
(ALK) and the MET/hepatocyte growth factor receptor
(HGFR) [11, 21]. However, it has been shown to bind and
inhibit multiple additional targets including the ROS1 and
RON receptor tyrosine kinases [22–24].
As the primary targets of crizotinib inhibition do
not appear to be expressed in NF2-null Schwann cells,
we employed ABPP to identify 10 kinases that appear
to be significantly inhibited by crizotinib. Although
it is possible that any of these kinases, either alone or
in combination, represents the target through which
crizotinib mediates its anti-tumor effects, the recently
reported association between NF2-status and sensitivity
to FAK1 inhibition (see below) led us to focus on FAK1
as the potential target. Moreover, previous reports using

competition binding approaches to assess inhibitor
selectivity/potency have identified crizotinib as a potent
inhibitor of FAK1 ([22] and HMS Library of Integrated
Network-based Cellular Signatures PF02341066
KINOMEscan dataset 20033). Multiple lines of evidence
from our work suggest that FAK1 is indeed the relevant
target of crizotinib. First, our data confirm that crizotinib
treatment inhibits the activation of FAK1, as determined
by phosphorylation of tyrosine 397 which correlates with
activation of this kinase [25, 26]. Second, treatment of
NF2-null Schwann cells with small molecules inhibitors
of FAK1 result in inhibition of cell proliferation in a dosedependent manner, mimicking the outcomes of crizotinib
treatment. Third, and most important, direct inhibition of
FAK1 in two NF2-null Schwann cell lines, using siRNA
or shRNA, recapitulates the phenotypes observed with
crizotinib treatment and confirms that loss of FAK1 is
incompatible with proliferation of these cells. Finally, the
ability of crizotinib resistant FAK1 mutants to shift and
increase the EC50 of crizotinib against SC4 cells suggests
that the effects of crizotinib in these cells are mediated
largely through FAK1 inhibition. While these studies do
not exclude the possible contribution of other targets,

the extent and concordance of the phenotypes observed
suggest that inhibition of FAK1 is the major mechanism
through which the effects of crizotinib are mediated.
FAK1 (coded by the PTK2 gene) is a cytoplasmic
tyrosine kinase shown to be upregulated and activated
in a range of solid tumor types. FAK1 promotes cell
proliferation, survival, motility and other functions,
through kinase-dependent and independent mechanisms
[27]. Recent studies in a panel of mesothelioma cells lines
revealed that sensitivity to FAK1 inhibition was inverselycorrelated to levels of Merlin expression. The proposed
mechanism suggests Merlin loss leads to destabilization
of cell:cell junctions, which causes the cells to become
more reliant on cell-ECM interactions for survival and

proliferation. As FAK1 is a critical effector of these
proliferative/survival signals, the consequences of FAK1
inhibition in the context of NF2 loss are detrimental to
the cells [18]. Other studies examining the relationship
between Merlin and FAK1 in ovarian cancer cell identified
a correlation between Merlin expression levels and
sensitivity to FAK1 inhibitors, when cells were grown in
an anchorage-independent manner. Intriguingly, stable
knockdown of Merlin in resistant cells did not sensitize
cells to FAK1 inhibition. This suggests that at least in
ovarian cancer cell lines Merlin expression might predict
responsiveness to FAK1 inhibitors, although a causal link
between Merlin and FAK1 was not identified [17]. These
recent findings, along with the data presented in our report,

strongly implicate FAK1 as a critical effector and as a
relevant target in the context of Merlin deficiency.
From a clinical standpoint, crizotinib represents an
excellent candidate for evaluation in NF2. It is well tolerated
and has already received FDA approval for the treatment of
patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that are
positive for activating ALK fusions. In addition, crizotinib is
being evaluated in phase I/II trials in children with relapsed/
refractory solid tumors and primary CNS tumors such as
neuroblastoma (NCT00939770). In addition to assessing the
efficacy of crizotinib against NF2-deficient schwannomas,
the activity of crizotinib against other NF2-null tumors, such
as meningiomas and mesotheliomas, should be evaluated.
While crizotinib was developed as an MET/ALK inhibitor,
there are a number of inhibitors specifically developed
against FAK1 that are currently in various stages of clinical
trial. These include GSK2256098, PND-1186 (VS-4718),

PF-271 (VS-6062) and defactinib (VS-6063) [27]. Once
approved, these drugs could represent additional therapeutic
options for NF2-null tumors and should thus be evaluated.
Interestingly, our studies with PND-1186 and defactinib
suggest a similar potency of these drugs compared to
crizotinib. This suggests that the inhibitory capacity of
crizotinib against FAK1 is sufficient to elicit a favorable
effect. However, a true comparison of these drugs will
ultimately require assessment in a clinical trial setting.
In summary, our studies identify an FDA approved
drug, crizotinib, which shows in vitro and in vivo efficacy
against NF2-null schwannomas. Furthermore, our studies
identify the mechanism of action, through the inhibition of
FAK1. Given the lack of curative options for NF2 and the
favorable tolerability of this drug, crizotinib represents an
excellent candidate for clinical testing in patients harboring
NF2-deficient tumors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell proliferation assays

Cell culture conditions

30,000 cells/well were plated in 12-well dishes in
triplicate. At indicated time points, cells from individual
wells were trypsinized and counted using a Coulter
counter (Z1 series, Beckman Coulter). Cell growth media
was replaced daily. For measurement of cell proliferation,
cells were plated at the numbers indicated in the figures
and BrdU Proliferation Assay (Millipore) was used
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Statistical
significance was determined by a two-tailed student’s
t-test. Each condition at each time point represents the
mean of 3 experiments in triplicate for a total of 9 wells.

The SC4 and HEI193 cell lines were obtained
from The House Ear Institute and ATCC, respectively.
The hSC2l cells are a gift from Dr. Margaret Wallace
(U. of Florida) [28]. All cell lines were authenticated
by short tandem repeat (STR) DNA profiling (DDC
Medical) (March 2015) and verified to be clean of
mycoplasma contamination using a PCR based approach.
Cells were grown in low-glucose DME, 10% fetal calf
serum, 1× non-essential amino acids and 100 IU/ml
penicillin-streptomycin. Transfections were performed
with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), following
manufacturer’s instructions.

Generation of FAK1 mutants and stable SC4
clones
The FAK1 mutant constructs were created by PCR
amplification of FAK1 cDNA from the pLV-Neo-CD2FAK1 (addgene #37013) and cloning into pcDNA3.1
using NheI and NotI sites (primer sequences Fak-Nhe1F

Bacterial clones were isolated and sequence verified. SC4
Cells were transfected with 8 μg of plasmid DNA, using
Lipofectamine 2000 (cat# 11668019), and were placed under
G418 selection, 150 ug/ml until individual clones could be
picked and expanded for experimentation.

Western blot analysis
Protein extracts were prepared with RIPA lysis
buffer (50 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40,
0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EGTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mM NaF). The
following antibodies were used according to manufactures’
instructions: MET, FAK1 and FAK-pY397 (cat# 3127,
3285, 3283 - Cell Signaling Technology).

RNAi-mediated knockdown of FAK
HEI193 and SC4 cells were transfected using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, NY, USA), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Specifically HEI193 cells
were transfected with siRNA duplexes targeting FAK1
[ID# SR303877A- GCAAUGGAGCCGAGUAUUA
AAGGUCT and SR303877B- AGAAGAUACUUACA
CCAUGCCCUCA] as well as a non-targeting siRNA
control [ID # SR30004- CGUUAAUCGCGUAUAAUACG
CGUAT] (Origene, Rockville, USA) at a concentration
of 30 nM. SC4 cells were transfected with TRC mouse
shRNA individual clones targeting FAK1 [ID # TRCN0000
023484 -5′-CGGTCCAATGACAAGGTATAT-3′ and
TRCN0000023486–5′-CCAACCTTAATAGAGAAGAA

RNA sequencing data
RNA from SC4 cells was extracted using TRIZOL
reagent. 5–10 μg of total RNA was used to isolate poly(A)
RNA using the micropoly(A) purist kit (Ambion). The
whole transcriptome library kit (Life Technologies) was
used to prepare paired-end sequencing libraries. Briefly,
100 ng of poly(A)+ RNA was enzymatically fragmented
to an average size of 150 nt, ligated to directional adapters
and reverse-transcribed, and the cDNA was size-selected
on denaturing 6% TBE-Urea polyacrylamide gels,
amplified for 15 cycles with barcoded primers and purified
using AmpPure XP beads. The resulting library was
quantified using Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and Taqman (Life
Technologies) assays. The barcoded library combined
was used at a final concentration of 0.4 pM in emulsion
PCR to link to the sequencing beads. For analysis, the
sequencing reads in color-space were mapped to the mm9

CRISPR/Cas9 editing of MET
Guide sequences from exon 1 of the MET locus
(g#1- GTTTACTGACATACGCGGCT and g#2GTTCATCTCAGACTTCACTA) were cloned into the
pX459 vector (Addgene). SC4 cells were transfected with
8 mg of plasmid into the SC4 cells using Lipofectamine
2000, according to manufacturer’s instructions. Cells
were selected for 48 hours in puromycin and individual
clones were picked and expanded after 7 days. Clones
were analyzed by western blotting to determine loss of
MET expression.

genome using Tophat [29]. The number of reads falling
into each gene defined in the RefSeq gene annotations was
quantified using HTSeq-count [30]. Samples from three
independent experiments were sequenced, combined, and
analyzed to produce the final DESeq data. The RNA-Seq
data is publicly available through the NCBI GEO database
with accession number GSE61528.

MS and MS/MS data were acquired with a
Q Exactive™ Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass
SpectroMETer (Thermo) equipped with an EASYnLC1000 nano UHPLC (Thermo). Each individual
sample was resuspended in 20 µL of sample buffer (2%
ACN, 0.1% TFA) and injected (5 µL) onto the Thermo
Scientific EASY-Spray column (C18, 2 µM, 100 A,
75 µM X 25 cm). A linear gradient from 5% B (CH3CN
+ 0.1% formic acid) to 25% B in 150 minutes and then
25% B to 45% B in 15 minutes, followed by 45% B to
95% B in 5 minutes and pumping 95% of B for additional
10 minutes. MS and MS/MS data were analyzed by
MaxQuant 1.5.0.0 with a UniProtKB database using label
free quantifications.

Determination of EC50s and dose response
analysis
To determine the EC50 of crizotinib 2500 cells from
each clone were plated, in quadruplicate, in a solid white
cell culture 384-well plate. Crizotinib was added to the
wells in a three-fold ten-point dilution series ranging from
12.5 μM to 0.0006 μM. Crizotinib activity was evaluated
24 hours after treatment using CellTiter-Glo (Promega,
USA) as a read-out of viability. The EC50 values were
calculated using Graphpad Prism.

Statistical analysis
To assess the anti-tumor activity of crizotinib
in vivo, the natural log-transformed flux readings were
used to reflect tumor growth. The trends of tumor
growth over time (followed up by days) were examined
between control and treatment groups using a mixedeffect model with the random effect at the mouse
level. A linear function, in days, was determined to
provide the best fit without random slope on followup days. A likelihood ratio testing nested models
(with versus without the interaction term of group and
time) was used to examine if trends are significantly
different overall between groups. The tumor weights
were first examined by a Shapiro-Wilk test to assess
data normality and a Variance ratio test was used to
examine the equality of variances between two groups.
The differences between the control and experimental
cohorts were analyzed by a t-test with equal variances.
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 12.0
(StataCorp LP, Texas, USA).

In vivo tumor models and imaging
All animal experiments were approved by the
Scripps Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
and performed in accordance with relevant institutional
and national guidelines. The use of the orthotopic tumor
model was previously described [31]. Briefly, Nf2−/−
SC4 Schwann cells were transduced by lentiviruses
carrying pLuc-mCherry and sorted by FACS. 5 × 104
cells were transplanted into the sciatic nerve sheath
of NOD/SCID mice (8 weeks of age) by intraneural
injection. Tumor progression was monitored every 3
days by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions on an IVIS-200 system
(Xenogen, San Francisco, CA).

MIB chromatography
Cells were treated with 10 mM crizotinib for the
indicated time points and tumors were harvested as
previously described [16]. Protein lysates containing
3 mg of total protein each were brought to 1 M NaCl and
passed through columns of inhibitor-conjugated beads
(Bisindoylmaleimide-X,SB203580, Dasatinib, PP58,
VI16832, and CTx-0294885) to isolate protein kinases.
Kinase-bound inhibitor beads were washed with high- and
low-salt buffers and 0.1% SDS before elution by boiling in
0.5% SDS with 1% b-mercaptoethanol in 0.1 M Tris-HCl
(pH 6.8). Proteins were purified using chloroform/methanol
extraction and resuspended in 50 mM HEPES (pH 8).
Samples were digested overnight at 37oC using sequencing
grade modified trypsin (Promega). Peptides were fractionated
with Mini SCX spin columns and cleaned with PepClean
C18 Spin Columns (Thermo Scientific) before MS analysis.
