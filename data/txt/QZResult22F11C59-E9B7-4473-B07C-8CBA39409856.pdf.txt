ABSTRACT
Our previous studies have demonstrated that expression of epidermal fatty
acid binding protein (E-FABP) in tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) promotes
macrophage anti-tumor activity by enhancing IFNβ responses in tumor models. Thus,
E-FABP represents a new protective factor in enhancing tumor immune surveillance
against tumor development. Herein, we report the compound 5-(benzylamino)-2(3-methylphenyl)-1,3-oxazole-4-carbonitrile (designated EI-05) as a novel E-FABP
activator for inhibition of mammary tumor growth. EI-05 was selected from the ZINC
compound library using molecular docking analysis based on the crystal structure of
E-FABP. Although EI-05 is unable to bind E-FABP directly, it significantly increases
E-FABP expression in macrophages during inflammation. Stimulation of macrophages
with EI-05 remarkably enhances lipid droplet formation and IFNβ production, which
further promotes the anti-tumor activity of macrophages. Importantly, administering
EI-05 in vivo significantly inhibits mammary tumor growth in a syngeneic mouse
model. Altogether, these results suggest that EI-05 may represent a promising drug
candidate for anti-tumor treatment through enhancing E-FABP activity and IFNβ
responses in macrophages.

INTRODUCTION

liver FABP (L-FABP) and intestinal FABP (I-FABP),
exhibit tissue-specific patterns of distribution, epidermal
FABP (E-FABP) displays a more ubiquitous expression,
particularly in immune cells, suggesting an essential
role of E-FABP in regulating energy metabolism and
functions of immune populations [6, 7]. In our studies
focusing on the role of E-FABP in tumor development,
we have demonstrated that E-FABP deficiency in mice
accelerates mammary tumor growth through impairing
IFNβ responses in tumor associated macrophages
(TAMs), suggesting E-FABP as a new protective factor
in host against tumor development [8]. In addition, we
also have reported that E-FABP expression in mice
promotes the development of experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) [9]. While effective anti-tumor
immune responses require the expression of E-FABP,
overactivity of E-FABP in immune cells may instead
promote inflammatory autoimmune responses. Thus, our
studies suggest that E-FABP functions as an important
immune regulator in shaping immune functions in

Tumor initiation and progression are complex
processes which depend not only on intrinsic alterations
in tumor cells, but also on the extrinsic factors from host
immunity. How to enhance tumor immune surveillance
remains one of the most active research areas in tumor
immunology [1, 2]. Emerging evidence indicates that
energetic metabolism of immune cells profoundly impacts
their functions and fates [3]. Therefore, investigating the
role of distinct metabolic pathways in immune populations
and uncovering how these pathways determine their
immunologic consequences represent important foci for
the control of tumor development.
Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) represent a
family of small and highly homologous cytoplasmic
lipid chaperones that regulate lipid transfer and responses
inside cells. Accumulating data have shown that FABPs
are central regulators of both metabolic and inflammatory
pathways [4, 5]. While most FABP members, such as

macrophages

different disease settings, and modulating E-FABP activity
may provide an attractive approach for treatment of tumor
and autoimmune diseases.
In fact, the use of pharmacological agents to modify
FABP function has been proposed in many studies to
control inflammatory responses and metabolic syndromes,
thus offering a new class of multi-indication therapeutic
agents [10-13]. In our efforts to screen for small molecule
compounds that may regulate E-FABP activity for
potential clinical application, we identified one compound
5-(benzylamino)-2-(3-methylphenyl)-1,3-oxazole-4carbonitrile (designated EI-05) which enhances E-FABP
expression in macrophages and promotes their type I
IFNβ responses during inflammation. More importantly,
administration of this newly-identified compound
significantly inhibited mammary tumor growth in vivo.

When we activated a macrophage cell line with LPS
in the presence or absence of EI-05 and other potential
E-FABP partners identified by computational modeling
analysis, we found that EI-05, but not other small
molecules, significantly enhanced E-FABP expression
in macrophages (Figure 2A). We further investigated the
effect of EI-05 on E-FABP expression with primary GMCSF-induced macrophages derived from mouse bone
marrow (GM-BMMs). We demonstrated that E-FABP
expression in EI-05-stimulated macrophages was about
4.5 fold higher than that in control groups (Figure 2B).
Consistent with these in vitro observations, when EI-05
was administered in vivo, it was able to greatly enhance
E-FABP expression in macrophages of the peripheral
blood as shown by western blot analysis (Figure 2C).
Confocal microscopy staining further demonstrated that
EI-05 treatment greatly enhanced E-FABP expression in
the cytoplasm of macrophages (Figure 2D). Thus, these
data suggest that EI-05 can activate macrophages through
enhanced E-FABP expression in both in vitro and in vivo
conditions.

RESULTS
Screening of potential E-FABP modifiers by
molecular modeling
As identification of small molecule inhibitors
of FABP has been proven to be effective in treating
atherosclerosis and type II diabetes in mouse models [14],
we initially intended to screen small molecules that might
specifically bind to the lipid-binding pocket of E-FABP
using computational docking analysis [15]. Based on the
crystal structure of E-FABP (PDB ID 1B56), EI-05 (Figure
1A) was selected as a potential E-FABP partner due to the
predicted binding of E-FABP/EI-05 complex shown by
molecular docking modeling (Figure 1B). However, when
we purified recombinant E-FABP proteins and conducted
in vitro binding assays, we found that E-FABP did not
bind to EI-05, despite good binding to the known inhibitor
BMS309403 [16], in thermal shift assays (Figure 1C).
As EI-05 exhibited a relatively low excitation signal at
270 nm (Figure 1D), which enabled this wavelength to
be used to excite Tyr and Trp in E-FABP, we evaluated
the binding of E-FABP/EI-05 by Förster resonance energy
transfer based on the spectral overlap of the E-FABP Tyr/
Trp emission and EI-05 excitation signals. Step-wise
addition of EI-05 to E-FABP did not affect the emission
of E-FABP Tyr/Trp (Figure 1E). The strong stepwise
increases in EI-05 emission signal at 394 nm, shown in
Figure 1E, were nearly the same in the absence of E-FABP
(Figure 1F), consistent with no energy transfer. In contrast,
positive controls performed with BMS309403 showed the
expected dose-dependent increase of E-FABP Tyr/Trp
emission (Figure 1G). Thus, although predicted to bind
E-FABP by computational modeling, our in vitro binding
assays clearly indicate that EI-05 has no direct binding to
E-FABP.

EI-05 promotes IFNβ production in macrophages
As E-FABP expression in TAMs can promote
IFNβ responses [8], we next analyzed whether EI-05
treatment impacts IFNβ production in macrophages.
Indeed, addition of EI-05 greatly enhanced IFNβ mRNA
levels in LPS-activated GM-BMMs (Figure 3A) in a
dose-dependent manner. Similarly, IFNβ protein levels
in the culture supernatants were also positively elevated
in response to increasing concentrations of EI-05 (Figure
3B). As leaking DNA from cellular damage can induce
IFNβ production [17], we analyzed the cytotoxicity of EI05 on macrophages, and demonstrated a minimal impact
of EI-05 on macrophage death (Figure 3C), suggesting
that a specific effect of IFNβ production was induced
by EI-05. When we measured IFNβ production using
E-FABP WT and KO macrophages, we found that EI-05
treatment promoted E-FABP and IFNβ production in the
WT cells, but not in the E-FABP KO cells (Figure 3D,
3E), indicating an E-FABP-dependent effect for EI-05induced IFNβ production in macrophages. In our previous
studies, we have shown that E-FABP-promoted lipid
droplet (LD) formation was positively associated with
IFNβ production [8]. It is likely that EI-05 treatment may
promote IFNβ production through E-FABP-promoted LD
formation. To this end, we measured the impact of EI-05
on LD formation in macrophages. Confocal microscope
analysis showed that EI-05 greatly upregulated LD
formation in macrophages (Figure 3F). In agreement with
our previous results, EI-05-enhanced LD formation and

EI-05 treatment enhances macrophage activation

IFNβ production were dramatically inhibited by Tracsin C,
a specific LD inhibitor (Figure 3G), further indicating the
importance of LDs in mediating the production of IFNβ
in macrophages. Of note, EI-05 treatment did not affect
the expression of other FABP members, such as L-FABP
and A-FABP, and the production of other tumor-related
cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, iNOS, etc
(Figure 4A-4H). When we further analyzed the production
of IFNβ and other cytokines by peritoneal macrophages
(PEMs), we confirmed that that EI-05 also enhanced
IFNβ production in these physiologic populations (Figure
4I, 4J). These results indicate that EI-05 treatment
greatly promotes E-FABP-mediated IFNβ production in
macrophages.

Considering the critical role of IFNβ in activating
antigen presenting cells [18, 19], we next measured the
expression of MHCII and CD86 on macrophages in the
presence or absence of EI-05 in vitro. As expected, EI-05
treatment not only increased the percentage of MHCII+
cells in F4/80+ PEMs, but also upregulated the expression
intensity of MHCII molecules (Figure 5A, 5B). CD86
expression was also significantly enhanced in response to
EI-05 treatment (Figure 5C). To evaluate the relevance of
these in vitro observations, we intraperitoneally injected
mice with either EI-05 or the vehicle and analyzed the
phenotypes of macrophages in vivo. Consistently, EI-05

administration significantly increased MHCII+ populations
in F4/80+ PEMs as compared to vehicle-treated mice
(Figure 5D). In addition, mice treated with EI-05
exhibited elevated MHCII+ macrophages in their bone
marrow, suggesting a systemic effect of EI-05 (Figure
5E). Moreover, we measured IFN-stimulated chemokines
in PEMs and demonstrated that EI-05 treatment greatly
enhanced the expression of CXCL10 and CXCL11 (Figure
5F, 5G). Accordingly, there were increased infiltration of
CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in the peritoneum of EI05-treated mice in comparison to control mice (Figure
5H). Altogether, our data suggest that EI-05 treatment
greatly activates macrophages for antigen presentation,
and subsequent T cell responses.

docking analysis with Glide XP [15, 20]. Based on the
score ranking and the molecular docking model against
the E-FABP protein structure, EI-05 and several other
compounds attracted our attention due to their potential
binding to the lipid-binding pocket of E-FABP. However,
when we conducted in vitro binding assays to detect
protein-ligand interactions using various independent
methods, such as fluorescent measurements, thermal
shift assays and bead pull-down assays, none of the data
showed any positive evidence of effective EI-05/E-FABP
interactions. Because the positive binding of BMS309403
and other compounds to E-FABP were clearly observed
in our assays, we were convinced that EI-05 actually
does not bind to E-FABP (Figure 1). However, when we
performed biological experiments with EI-05, we found
that E-FABP is able to specifically enhance E-FABP
expression in macrophages from different origins (Figure
2). Since the molecular mechanisms by which E-FABP
is regulated remain largely unknown, it warrants further
investigation to determine how EI-05 enhances E-FABP
expression in macrophages.
Given that E-FABP upregulation in TAMs promotes
IFNβ production and signaling to promote macrophage
anti-tumor activity [8], we further analyzed whether EI-05
enhances IFNβ responses in macrophages. In fact, EI-05
treatment greatly enhances IFNβ production in both bone
marrow-derived macrophages and PEMs (Figures 3, 4).
In agreement with our previous studies, EI-05 markedly
promotes LD formation in macrophages, which facilitates
the enhanced production of IFNβ. We noticed that LD
inhibition does not completely inhibit EI-05-enhanced
production of IFNβ, thus, it is possible that EI-05 may
also utilize other pathways to regulate IFNβ production.
It has been shown that IFNβ production can be regulated
by PPARγ in TLR3- and TLR4-stimulated macrophages
[21]. We observed that EI-05 treatment promotes nuclear
translocation of PPARγ and PPAR β/δ in macrophages
(data not shown). Considering E-FABP as a target gene
for PPARβ/δ [22], it is likely that EI-05 may regulate the
transactivation of PPARs, thereby contributing to IFNβ
production in macrophages.
Due to the critical role of type I IFNs in regulating
innate and adaptive immunity, IFNα/β have been used
in treatment of different types of tumors [23-25]. Unlike
IFNγ which acts directly on tumor cells, IFNα/β exerts
its anti-tumor activity mainly through acting on immune
populations, such as CD11c+ APCs, CD8+ T cells, etc [19,
26]. For example, type I IFN endogenously produced by
innate cells can bridge adaptive immune responses by
upregulating MHC molecule expression on APCs, and
enhancing Granzyme B-mediated tumor cytotoxicity of
tumor infiltrated CD8+ T cells, all of which are supported
by our data (Figures 5, 6). However, it should be pointed
out that exogenously administered IFNα/β is often
accompanied by many side effects, which extensively
limit its clinical use. In addition, the pleiotropism and

EI-05 treatment reduces mammary tumor growth
in vivo
To investigate the therapeutic efficacy of EI-05 for
tumor treatment, we orthotopically inoculated mouse
E0771 mammary tumor cells into the mammary fat pat
of mice and measured the tumor growth in EI-05- or
vehicle-treated mice. Very strikingly, tumor growth in
EI-05-treated mice was significantly decreased in volume
(about 40%) as compared to vehicle-treated group
(Figure 6A). Accordingly, tumors in EI-05 treated mice
exhibited reduced size and weight than those in control
mice (Figure 6B, 6C). Interestingly, EI-05 treatment
greatly increased the percentage of F4/80+CD11c+ TAMs
in tumors (Figure 6D). It is worth noting that EI-05
administration also remarkably enhanced the production
of IFNγ and Granzyme B by tumor-infiltrated CD8+ T cells
(Figure 6E, 6F). Thus, these results suggest that EI-05
administration is able to inhibit mammary tumor growth,
thus representing a novel drug candidate for anti-tumor
treatment.

DISCUSSION
We have previously demonstrated that E-FABP
expression in TAMs promotes their anti-tumor
phenotype through enhanced IFNβ responses in
mammary tumor models [8]. This study suggests
E-FABP as a new protective factor that can enhance
tumor immunosurveillance. Thus, identification of new
chemicals or dietary factors which specifically upregulate
E-FABP expression in macrophages may provide novel
strategies for prevention and treatment of cancer. In this
follow-up study, we identified EI-05 as a new E-FABP
activator for inhibition of mammary tumor growth in a
syngeneic mouse model.
To identify small molecules which may bind
E-FABP and inhibit its activity and be used for treatment
of autoimmune diseases, we screened more than one
million compounds from the ZINC library using in-silico

redundancy of cytokine signaling make their use for
immunotherapy a great challenge in vivo. It has been
reported that exposure to exogenous IFNβ can decrease
the expression of IFNGR1 and inhibit IFNγ-induced
activation of macrophages [27]. Thus, the efficacy of
direct application of exogenous IFNβ is very mixed and
can be compromised due to the cross-regulation between
type I and type II IFNs.
Since EI-05 can enhance E-FABP expression
and endogenous IFNβ production by macrophages, it is
logical to speculate that administering of EI-05 may be
beneficial for anti-tumor therapy. To prove our concept,
we first tested the toxicity of EI-05 application in vivo at
the dose of 5 mg/kg/mice, 10 mg/kg/mice and 20 mg/kg/
mice, respectively, based on other small molecules used
in vivo [14]. All tested mice showed no toxic responses
to EI-05 treatment regarding mouse weight, numbers of
PBMCs, immune cell phenotype and cytokine production
(data not shown), so we tested the efficacy of EI-05 using
the middle dose at 10 mg/kg for tumor treatment with a
syngeneic mouse mammary tumor model. Indeed, we
demonstrated that EI-05 has great therapeutic efficacy
in suppressing mammary tumor growth. Although more
studies are under investigation to optimize the routes of
administration and to test its efficacy in other tumors,
EI-05 represents a promising drug candidate for anticancer treatment in many aspects. 1) It is clear that cell
metabolism profoundly impacts their function [28, 29].
As the predominant FABP member in immune cells,
E-FABP expression is critical in coordinating metabolism
and function in immune cells [30]. Thus, enhancing
E-FABP expression by EI-05 will facilitate their antitumor activity. 2) Due to the dual roles of IFNα/β in antitumor effect and pro-autoimmune responses [23], it is
very hard to control the right dosage of IFNβ when it is
administered exogenously. Instead, administering of EI05 will potentially reduce the side effects of exogenous
IFNβ in that EI-05-enhanced IFNβ will be coordinately
produced by host immune cells. 3) EI-05 itself shows a
minimal toxic effect on either cultured cells or on mice
when administered in vivo. Therefore, EI-05 has great
potential clinical application.
In summary, we have identified EI-05 as a new
activator for E-FABP. It not only enhances E-FABP
expression in macrophages but also promotes their
IFNβ production and responses. More importantly,
administering EI-05 in vivo significantly suppresses
mammary tumor growth. Thus, enhancing E-FABP
activity by EI-05 may provide a new strategy for cancer

METHODS
In silico screening for E-FABP modifiers
Based on the crystal structure of E-FABP (PDB
ID 1B56), in-silico screening was conducted using the
program Glide v5.7 [15]. Flexible docking was performed
with the standard precision (SP) mode. More than
one million compounds from the ZINC database were
screened for potential E-FABP modifiers. The top-ranked
compounds were clustered into different classes based on
similarity of chemical structures. Compound EI-05 was
selected due to its potential interaction with lipid binding
pocket of E-FABP. EI-05 was purchased from Interbio
Screen Ltd for biological experimental tests.

In vitro binding assays
Recombinant E-FABP was expressed in BL21
(DE3) and purified using Ni-NTA resin followed by the
cleavage of His-tag and ion-exchange chromatography.
Endogenous lipids bound to E-FABP were removed by
running through the Lipidex-1000 column. Binding of EI05/E-FABP was determined by two independent assays,
in addition to a compound-coupled bead pull-down assay.
For the thermal shift assay [31], reactions were set-up in
PCR tubes in a 20 µl volume containing 10 µM E-FABP
and 10× SYPRO Orange dye (Invitrogen) in 20 mM
HEPES pH 7 and 150 mM NaCl, containing either EI05, BMS or DMSO control. PCR tubes were then sealed,
centrifuged and heated from 25°C to 95°C at a rate of 1
degree/min on 7500 Real-Time PCR machine (Applied
Biosystems). For the fluorescence assay, we measured the
fluorescent signals of protein Trp as previously described
[32]. Briefly, emission spectra of E-FABP Tyr/Trp and EI05 were measured using Fluorolog-3 Spectrofluorometer
(Horiba Scientific). Emission spectra were recorded from
300 to 500 nm in the presence and absence of E-FABP
(0.5 µM) with addition of indicated concentrations of EI05 or BMS-309413 (positive control) at 25°C.

Generation of macrophages from bone marrow or
peritoneum
For generation of GM-CSF-induced bone marrowderived macrophages (GM-BMMs), bone marrow
from mouse femurs or tibias was flushed with PBS,
supplemented with 2% FBS. After lysis of red blood
cells (R&D systems), the cells were plated in 100-mm
tissue culture dishes with 5% FBS RPMI 1640 medium
at 37°C/5% CO2 for 4 hours. Then the non-adherent cells
were plated in 5% FBS RPMI 1640 medium with 20 ng/
ml GM-CSF (R&D Systems). New 5% FBS RPMI 1640

medium with 20 ng/ml GM-CSF was added on day 2
and day 5. The cultured GM-BMMs were collected on
day 7 for further experiments. For collecting peritoneal
macrophages (PEMs), cells from peritoneum were flushed
out with 10ml PBS and plated in 24-well plate for 2 hours.
After wash off the non-attached cells, attached PEMs were
used for experiments.

Immune cells from peritoneum or tumors were
subjected to surface staining or cultured with PMA (5 ng/
ml; Sigma), ionomycin (500 ng/ml; Sigma) and Golgiplug
(BD) for 6 hrs, harvested for surface and intracellular
staining. Flow cytometric data were collected with a
BD FACS Calibur™. Flow cytometric data analyses
were performed with Flowjo (Tree Star). The following
antibodies were used for cell staining: anti-CD4 (clone
RM4-5), anti-CD8 (clone 53-6.7), anti-MHC class II
(clone M5/114.15.2), anti-IFNγ (clone XMG1.2), antiGranzyme B (clone GB11), anti-CD80 (clone 16-10A1)
and anti-CD86 (clone GL-1), anti-CD11c (clone HL3) and
anti-F4/80 (clone BM8).

Real-time PCR
For real-time PCR analyses, RNA was extracted
from primary macrophages or macrophage cell lines
using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis was
performed with QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit
(Qiagen). Quantitative PCR was performed with SYBR®
Green PCR Master Mix using ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR
Systems (Applied Biosystems). E-FABP, IFNβ, CXCL10,
CXCL11, PPARγ, TNFα, IL-6, IL-10 and β-actin
expression was analyzed by QuantiTect primer assays
(Qiagen). Results were normalized to β-actin. Relative
expression of the target genes was measured using the
∆∆CT approach.

Mice and tumor model
C57BL/6 mice were bred and maintained in the
animal facility at the Hormel Institute in accordance
with the University of Minnesota Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Six to ten-weekold female mice were fed standard chow diet and
utilized for these experiments. All animal protocols were
approved by IACUC in the University of Minnesota and
followed national guidelines. E0771 cell line derived
from a C57BL/6 mouse mammary adenocarcinoma was
orthotopically injected into the mammary fat pad of
the mice. EI-05 (10 mg/kg) or vehicle control were i.p.
injected every other day until mice were sacrificed on day
27 after tumor cell injection. Tumors were measured at
3 day intervals with calipers at two bisecting diameters
and an approximate volume was calculated by the formula
(0.4) × (large diameter) × (small diameter)2 and single
cells from tumor were prepared as previously described
for analysis [8, 33].

cultured on poly-D-lysine coated coverslips (NeuVitro)
in a 24-well plate were treated with LPS (10 ng/ml) in
the presence or absence of EI-05 (20 µM) for 24h. After
fixation and permeabilization, the cells were stained with
E-FABP specific antibody (R&D System). Confocal
analysis was performed with Nikon Eclipse TE2000
confocal microscopy.

ELISA
GM-BMMs or PEMs were stimulated with LPS (10
ng/ml) in the presence or absence of EI-05 for 24 hours.
Culture supernatants were collected for measurement of
protein levels of IFNβ with mouse ELISA kits (Biolegend)
according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Statistical analysis
All quantitative data were shown as means ± SD.
Unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t-test was performed for
comparison of results from different treatments. P value
less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant.

Western blot

ACKNOWLEGEMENTS

To quantify the protein levels of E-FABP in
macrophages, macrophages from peripheral blood or
peritoneum with designated treatments were lysed
in 1×lysis buffer with protease and phosphorylation
inhibitors. Protein concentration was determined by BCA
assay (Thermo Scientific). 10 µg of total protein was
loaded. β-actin was quantified as a loading control. Mouse
E-FABP antibody (goat) was from R&D Systems. Mouse
β-actin antibodies (rabbit) were from Cell Signaling
Technology.
