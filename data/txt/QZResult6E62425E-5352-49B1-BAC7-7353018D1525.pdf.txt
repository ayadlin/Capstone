Abstract
Abnormal alternative splicing has been associated with cancer. Genome-wide microarrays can be used to
detect differential splicing events. In this study, we have developed ExonPointer, an algorithm that uses data from
exon and junction probes to identify annotated cassette exons. We used the algorithm to proﬁle differential
splicing events in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells after downregulation of the oncogenic serine/arginine-rich
splicing factor 1 (SRSF1). Data were generated using two different microarray platforms. The PCR-based
validation rate of the top 20 ranked genes was 60% and 100%. Functional enrichment analyses found a substantial number of splicing events in genes related to RNA metabolism. These analyses also identiﬁed genes
associated with cancer and developmental and hereditary disorders, as well as biologic processes such as cell
division, apoptosis, and proliferation. Most of the top 20 ranked genes were validated in other adenocarcinoma
and squamous cell lung cancer cells, with validation rates of 80% to 95% and 70% to 75%, respectively. Moreover,
the analysis allowed us to identify four genes, ATP11C, IQCB1, TUBD1, and proline-rich coiled-coil 2C (PRRC2C),
with a signiﬁcantly different pattern of alternative splicing in primary non–small cell lung tumors compared with
normal lung tissue. In the case of PRRC2C, SRSF1 downregulation led to the skipping of an exon overexpressed in
primary lung tumors. Speciﬁc siRNA downregulation of the exon-containing variant signiﬁcantly reduced cell
growth. In conclusion, using a novel analytical tool, we have identiﬁed new splicing events regulated by the
oncogenic splicing factor SRSF1 in lung cancer. Cancer Res; 74(4); 1105–15. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Alternative splicing is the process by which different mRNA
isoforms are processed from a single primary transcript. In
humans, estimates indicate that as many as 95% of multiexonic
genes are alternatively spliced (1). Cassette exon, in which an
exon is either retained or spliced out of the transcript, is the
most common alternative splicing event in mammals, and
accounts for approximately half of all events (2–4). Alternative
splicing has an essential role in the regulation of cell homeostasis. When this process becomes deregulated it can lead to
pathologic conditions such as cancer (5–8). Deregulation of
splicing is often associated with an abnormal expression

pattern of splicing factors (9). One of these factors is serine/
arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1). This molecule is a
member of the serine/arginine-rich protein family, which is
involved in constitutive and alternative splicing (10). The
SRSF1 protein contains 2 RNA recognition motives (RRM) at
the N-terminal and one arginine/serine rich domain at the Cterminal. The arginine/serine rich domain mediates protein–
protein interactions in the spliceosome assembly (11). The
SRSF1 protein is also implicated in other functions, such as
nonsense-mediated RNA decay, translation and RNA transport, genome stability, and senescence (12, 13). The expression
of SRSF1 is upregulated in several human neoplasias and
participates in the establishment and maintenance of a transformed phenotype (14, 15). Consequently, the study of the
alternative splicing events regulated by this factor is of particular interest.
A number of genome-wide array approaches have been
developed to study changes in alternative splicing (16). These
arrays contain probes in exons (exon arrays), probes along the
whole genome (tiling arrays), or probes in exons and junctions
(junction arrays). The characteristics of the splicing arrays
developed to date are summarized in Supplementary Table S1.
The analytical process for the evaluation of differential splicing
events is a key aspect to consider when using these arrays. A
serious limitation of exon arrays is that the exclusion of an exon
must be inferred by the absence of a signal. In contrast, a
microarray design that includes junction probes indicates the
exclusion of an exon by the hybridization of probes to the

skipping junction. Consequently, the current trend is to work
with arrays that include probes in annotated junctions. Unfortunately, there are very few algorithms that take advantage of
the redundancy provided by junction probes (17–25).
In this study we have developed an algorithm, named
ExonPointer, which combines data from exon and junction
probes and was optimized to identify annotated cassette
exons. We used the algorithm to identify differential alternative
cassette events in lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells after the
downregulation of SRSF1. Expression data were generated
using 2 platforms: Oryzon custom arrays (Agilent technology)
and GeneSplice arrays (Affymetrix technology). Validation
rates were 60% and 100% for Agilent and Affymetrix platforms,
respectively, which demonstrate the effectiveness of this procedure in ﬁnding alternative splicing events. In addition, most
of these events were validated in other lung cancer cell lines
and, more importantly, allowed us to identify genes with
signiﬁcant differences in splicing between primary lung
tumors and normal lung tissue. Finally, functional studies
demonstrated the implication of one splicing isoform of proline-rich coiled-coil 2C (PRRC2C), one of the SRSF1-regulated
genes, in cell proliferation. In conclusion, we have developed a
useful tool for the analysis of alternative splicing and have
identiﬁed new splicing events regulated by the oncogenic
splicing factor SRSF1.

Materials and Methods
Biological material
Primary lung tumors were obtained from patients with non–
small cell lung cancer who had been treated with resectional
surgery at the Clinica Universidad de Navarra (Pamplona,
Spain). Clinicopathologic characteristics of the patients are
shown in Supplementary Table S2. Nontumor lung specimens
were sampled at a distance from the tumor to guarantee that
the tissues were free from cancerous cells. Tissue samples were
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 C
until extraction of RNA. Samples were included in the study if
greater than 70% of their cells were tumor cells. The study
protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee
and all patients gave written informed consent. RNA extraction
was performed as previously described (26).
Lung adenocarcinoma cell lines A549, HCC827, and H2087
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.
Squamous cell carcinoma cell lines HCC95 and LUDLU-1 were
obtained from the Korean Cell Line Bank and the European
Collection of Cell Cultures, respectively. Cell lines were authenticated by analysis of their genetic alterations. Cells were grown
in RPMI supplemented with 2 mmol/L glutamine, 10% Fetalclone (Thermo), 100 U/mL of penicillin and 100 mg/mL of
streptomycin (Invitrogen).
Downregulation of SRSF1 and expression analysis
Cells were transfected with a 30 nmol/L solution of a
nontargeting scramble siRNA (50 -ACGACACGCAGGTCGTCATtt-30 ) or an SRSF1 siRNA (50 -TGAAGCAGGTGATGTATGTtt-30 ) using lipofectamine as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated for 48 hours after
transfection. Total RNA was extracted using the RNA/DNA

1106

Mini Kit (Qiagen). The efﬁciency of the SRSF1 siRNA knockdown was determined by real-time PCR, using SYBR Green
PCR Master Mix and the following primers: 50 -GGAACAACGATTGCCGCATCTA-30 (forward); 50 -CTTGAGGTCGGATGTCGCGGATA-30 (reverse).
Microarray hybridization
Samples from 3 independent experiments using lipofectamine alone, scramble siRNA, or SRSF1 siRNA (i.e., a total of nine
samples) were labeled and hybridized in 2 different platforms:
Agilent custom-built microarrays from Oryzon Genomics and
Affymetrix GeneSplice arrays. The former were developed by
Oryzon Genomics in collaboration with our group, and have
been previously described (27). These arrays contain exon
probes and thermodynamically balanced junction probes. The
noncommercial Human GeneSplice Arrays were obtained
through a Technology Access program with Affymetrix. These
high-density arrays contain an average of 8 probes per probeset. RNA labeling and hybridization on the Agilent microarrays
were performed by Oryzon Genomics, as previously described
(27). Labeling and hybridization on the Affymetrix GeneSplice
microarrays were performed by the Proteomics, Genomics and
Bioinformatics Core Facility of the Center for Applied Medical
Research (CIMA) following manufacturer's instructions. The
microarray data from this study have been submitted to Gene
Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) under
accession number GSE53410.
ExonPointer algorithm
The ExonPointer algorithm was used to process and analyze
the microarray data. The aim in the design of ExonPointer was
to identify differential alternative splicing, i.e. genes that show
different relative concentrations of their isoforms, under different conditions. Fig. 1 illustrates the summarized steps of
ExonPointer. The mathematical deﬁnition of differential alternative splicing and the analytical steps are described in detail
in Supplementary Methods. Probes that did not indicate
expression levels greater than the background noise were
excluded from the analysis. Short genes with no more than
2 exons (i.e., no more than 3 probe sets) were also excluded.
Supplementary Fig. S1 shows a representative example of the
report generated by the algorithm, which points to the differential splicing event in a given gene.

Downregulation, expression analysis, and sequencing of
PRRC2C
Cells were cultured and transfected as described in section
"Down-regulation of SRSF1 and expression analysis." The
siRNA sequences were as follows: PRRC2C 50 -CGAACAGCCAGUCCAGCAA[dA][dA]-30 ; PRRC2C-L (long) 50 -GGAAGAGGACUCAGCCACA[dA][dA]-30 ; PRRC2C-S (short) 50 -GCACCCCAGGCAAAGCAGA[dA][dA]-30 . Primers used to quantify and
sequence the PRRC2C-L variant were: 50 -GTCCAGCAAAATGAACAGCA-30 (forward) and 50 -GAGTCCTCTTCCCACAGCTCTCT-30 (reverse). Primers used to quantify and sequence the
PRRC2C-S variant were: 50 -ACCCCAGGCAAAGCAGAG-30 (forward) and 50 -GATCGCCTGAGGTTTGATTG-30 (reverse). The

part of the ﬁgure, it can be
observed that the residuals of the
probes that hit an exon and its
ﬂanking junctions are positive and
the residuals of the skipping
junction are negative. The linear
model computes the P values that
correspond to these residuals. The
values are close to zero for the exon
and ﬂanking probes and close to
one for the skipping junction. The
overall P value is computed using
the Irwin–Hall distribution. These P
values are summarized taking into
account the possible inclusion or
retention of the analyzed exon.

PCR products were sequenced in the Proteomics, Genomics,
and Bioinformatics Core Facility of CIMA.
MTT and clonogenic assays
Cells were cultured and transfected as described in section "Downregulation of SRSF1 and expression analysis."
Six hours after transfection, cells were trypsinized and
seeded in 96-well plates at 1,500 cells/well for MTT assays.
Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide (MTT; Sigma) was
added at 0, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours, at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. After 4 hours of incubation, 100 mL
of solubilization solution (10% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 50%
N,N-dimethylformamide, pH 4.7) was added. Absorbance
was measured at 540 nm using 690 nm as a reference. For
clonogenic assays, 6 hours after transfection, cells were
trypsinized and seeded in 6-well plates at 300 cells/well.
Culture medium was replaced after 1 week of incubation and
removed after 2 weeks. Clones were ﬁxed with 1 mL of
formaldehyde/well for 30 minutes, dyed with few drops
of crystal violet for 10 minutes, and counted.

Cell-cycle and apoptosis analyses
Cells were cultured and transfected as described in section
"Downregulation of SRSF1 and expression analysis," and the
medium was replaced after 6 hours. At the indicated times,
suspended and attached cells were harvested. For apoptosis
analysis, cells were washed and stained with 10 mg/mL of
propidium iodide (Sigma) and 5 mL of Annexin V (BD Biosciences). For cell-cycle analysis, cells were ﬁxed with 70%
ethanol for at least 1 hour at 4 C and treated with 0.2 mg/mL
RNase A (Sigma) for 1 hour at 37 C. Cells were then stained with
10 mg/mL of propidium iodide (Sigma). All samples were
analyzed on a FACSCalibur Flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).
Percentages of cells in sub-G0–G1, G0–G1, S, and G2–M, for cellcycle analysis, or in quadrants, for apoptosis analysis, were
determined with FlowJo 9.3 software (Tree Star).
Enrichment analyses
The DAVID Functional Annotation Clustering application was used to create clusters in accordance with annotations from several databases (28). The DAVID Functional

Annotation tool was run to obtain P values for enriched
annotation terms. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis from Ingenuity
Systems (http://www.ingenuity.com/products/ipa) was used
to perform enrichment analyses of networks and functions.
Whole genome databases of the respective tools were used as
a reference for the analyses.
Statistical analyses
The statistical analysis for the selection of signiﬁcant alternative splicing events is detailed in the description of the
ExonPointer algorithm (Supplementary Methods). Differences
in the expression of splice variants in cell lines were assessed by
the Student t test. Ratios of expression in primary tumors and
normal tissues were tested for normality with the Shapiro–
Wilk test. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine
the statistical signiﬁcance of the differences between these
two groups. For MTT assays, the natural logarithm was calculated for each growth curve to obtain a straight line. Linear
regression was performed for each condition and the slopes
were compared with the Student t test. Clonogenic assays were
analyzed with the Student t test. All tests were performed in
STATA/IC 12.1 software (StataCorp).

Results
We developed the ExonPointer algorithm to identify
genome-wide differential alternative splicing events in A549
cells in which the levels of the oncogenic SRSF1 were downregulated with a speciﬁc siRNA. The efﬁciency of downregulation was assessed by real-time PCR (Supplementary Fig.
S2A). The splicing pattern of caspase-9 (CASP9) was used as
a positive control to conﬁrm the validity of our model.
Caspase-9 has two splice variants that differ in four consecutive exons, proapoptotic caspase-9a, and anti-apoptotic
caspase-9b. It has been reported that, in A549 cells, SRSF1
regulates the inclusion (CASP9a) or exclusion (CASP9b) of
this exon cassette (29). In accordance with the literature,
downregulation of SRSF1 induced a marked increase of the
CASP9b variant (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Microarray data were obtained from three independent
experiments using two different platforms: Agilent custombuilt microarrays from Oryzon Genomics and Affymetrix GeneSplice arrays. The ExonPointer algorithm was used to process
and analyze the results. The number of cassette events, after
the application of the selection criteria, was 24,205 for Oryzon
arrays and 18,583 for GeneSplice arrays. The total number of
genes was 4,062 and 7,326 for Oryzon and GeneSplice
arrays, respectively. Of these, 2,300 were common to both
platforms. For each platform, events were ranked in accordance with their P values. For validation, we selected the top 20
events ranked by ExonPointer in the two microarray platforms.
Only one gene, PPIP5K2, was common to both shortlists. For
each splicing event, a PCR was run with primers designed in the
exons that ﬂank the exon of interest, and the ratio between the
higher (exon inclusion) and lower band (exon exclusion) was
calculated. Twelve of the 20 genes (60% validation rate) selected by ExonPointer from the Oryzon platform data showed
differential alternative splicing (Supplementary Fig. S3 and
Table S3). The other 8 genes showed differences in expression

1108

or no observable changes (data not shown). Results were
consistent in all genes, that is the validated events were found
in all the triplicates, and, conversely, the events that were not
validated did not appear in any of the samples. Among the
validated genes, SRSF1 downregulation resulted in exon exclusion in 9 genes (NPRL3, PQBP1, DHPS, CHD3, MYOB1, RABL2B,
TMPO, MATR3, and CXorf26) and exon inclusion in 3 genes
(FN1, WNK1, and PP1P5K2). These changes were conﬁrmed
using samples from two independent experiments with A549
cells transfected under the same experimental conditions as
those used in the microarray studies (data not shown).
The same validation strategy was followed for the genes
selected by ExonPointer from the GeneSplice platform data.
Remarkably, 100% of the top 20 events were validated (Table 1
and Fig. 2) and the results were fully consistent among triplicates. Exclusion was again the predominant effect of SRSF1
downregulation, with 15 genes that showed an increase in exon
exclusion (ATP11C, SSH1, ABCD4, FIP1L1, TFDP1, IQCB1,
MPV17L, NAGK, RAD51C, PARPBP, ASAP1, EWSR1, TUBD1,
PRRC2C, and USP8), and only 5 genes that showed an increase
in exon retention (MYCBP2, MORF4L2, PPIP5K2, MAPT, and
SETD5). These changes were conﬁrmed using samples from the
2 independent experiments (data not shown). To establish a
reliable limit for the validity of the ranked list generated by
ExonPointer using GeneSplice microarray data, we validated
20 genes placed at lower positions in the list. We chose the
genes listed at positions 96–100, 146–150, 196–200, and 246–
250. We were able to validate 12 of these 20 genes (Supplementary Fig. S4). Exon exclusion was again the most frequent
event caused by SRSF1 downregulation (11 of the 12 validated
events). The top 250 events selected by ExonPointer were used
to perform an enrichment analysis of the cellular networks and
functions affected by the downregulation of SRSF1 in A549
cells. In the DAVID Functional Annotation Chart, the 2 most
common and enriched annotations were "alternative splicing"
and "splice variant" (Fig. 3). Within the top annotations, "RNA
binding," "mRNA processing," "Nucleotide binding," and "RNA
recognition motives" were present. These results indicated that
SRSF1 regulates splicing in pathways that are intrinsically
implicated in RNA metabolism. "Phosphoprotein" was also on
the top of the enriched annotations. The ingenuity analysis of
the differentially spliced genes regulated by SRSF1 built a total
of 11 networks. The ﬁrst contained 22 genes and included the
following annotations: "Cell Morphology, Developmental Disorder, and Hereditary Disorder" (Supplementary Fig. S5). The
next two networks contained 23 and 21 genes highly involved in
tumorigenesis and cancer development. The annotations
included in these two networks were: "Cell Cycle, Cellular
Assembly, and Organization and Cellular Movement" for the
second network (Supplementary Fig. S6); and "Organismal
Development, Cancer, Cell Death, and Survival" for the third
network (Supplementary Fig. S7). Many genes involved in these
networks have functions related to RNA metabolism (Table 2).
Functional annotations related to infection were also at the top
of the rank, although its biologic relevance needs to be
established.
We further assessed the reliability of the list generated from
the GeneSplice data by searching for events described in the

literature as targets of SRSF1. We ﬁrst analyzed the genes
reported by Karni and colleagues in their seminal paper
describing the oncogenic potential of SRSF1 (14). Interestingly,
even though the cell models were different (A549 vs. IMR90 and
HeLa cells), most of the events described in their study were
correctly identiﬁed by ExonPointer in our model (Supplementary Table S4). Other genes described in the literature as targets
of SRSF1 were also detected in our analysis: MAPT, P ¼
1.55e66 (30); CD44, P ¼ 2.04e22 (31); EPB41, P ¼ 2.22e22
(32); SRSF3, P ¼ 1.91e21 (33); CASP9, P ¼ 4.79e21 (29);
BCL2L1, P ¼ 5.03e03 (34); MCL1, P ¼ 1.13e17 (34); and FN1,
P ¼ 3.32e15 (35). These data reveal the notable capacity of
our procedure to identify alternative splicing events regulated
by SRSF1.
To conﬁrm the relevance of the information obtained from
lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, we validated the results in
four additional lung cancer cell lines: two adenocarcinomas
(HCC827 and H2087) and two squamous cell lung carcinomas
(HCC95 and LUDLU-1). Results of the validation after SRSF1
downregulation are shown in Table 1. Most of the genes were
validated in both histologic subtypes, although, as expected,
validation rates were higher in adenocarcinoma cell lines (95%
and 80%) than in squamous cell lines (75% and 70%).
Human cell lines retain many properties of the cells of origin,
but they also show clear differences and are not fully representative of the in vivo tumors (36). Therefore, we evaluated the
clinical relevance of our ﬁndings by determining the presence
of the identiﬁed splicing events in a cohort of primary lung
tumors and their corresponding normal lung tissues. After

conﬁrming the overexpression of SRSF1 in these tumors (Fig.
4A), we found a signiﬁcant deregulation in the splicing of four
genes: ATP11C, IQCB1, TUBD1, and PRRC2C (Fig. 4B–E).
Finally, we analyzed the role of one of these new splicing
events on the proliferative capacity of lung cancer cells. The
selected event was a cassette exon in PRRC2C. Based on the
ExonPointer report and the validation experiments, SRSF1
downregulation resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in exon
skipping. This result was further validated by PCR and realtime PCR in samples from both A549 cells (Fig. 5A and B) and
an extended cohort of human primary tumors (Fig. 4F).
Sequencing of the variants revealed that the alternative exon
contains 53 nucleotides and is located between exons 33
and 34. The presence of this exon results in a frameshift that
introduces a unique sequence of 41 amino acids in the Cterminal domain of the protein (Fig. 5C). Hereafter, the variant
containing the alternative exon will be referred as PRRC2C-L
(long) and the variant without this exon as PRRC2C-S (short).
To test the functional signiﬁcance of each variant on lung
cancer growth, we knocked down PRRC2C-L and PRRC2C-S in
A549 cells using speciﬁc siRNAs. Cell proliferation was
decreased after downregulation of the two spliced isoforms.
However, the effect of PRRC2C-L downregulation was significantly more pronounced (Fig. 5D). The differences were more

signiﬁcantly inhibited the formation of clones, whereas downregulation of PRRC2C-S had no effect (Fig. 5E). Cell-cycle

peak was also detected (Fig. 5F). This increase in the rate of
apoptosis was conﬁrmed using Annexin V (Fig. 5G). Comparable results were obtained with lung adenocarcinoma
HCC827 and H2087 cells (Supplementary Fig. S8A–S8F). In
lung squamous carcinoma HCC95 cells, downregulation of
PRRC2C resulted in a reduction of in vitro tumor growth,
mostly detected in clonogenic assays, although no differences
were observed between the 2 splice variants (Supplementary

squamous carcinoma LUDLU-1 cells (data not shown). Taken
together, these data suggest that the splicing of PRRC2C is
involved in the oncogenic activity of SRSF1.

exon-junction microarray technologies. We applied this algorithm to analyze differential alternative cassette events regulated by SRSF1 in the context of lung cancer. The experimental
validation rates using data from both Oryzon (Agilent) and
GeneSplice (Affymetrix) arrays demonstrated the efﬁcacy of
ExonPointer, although GeneSplice performed noticeably better. Agilent probes are longer and more sensitive than Affymetrix probes (37). However, the number of probes per array, and
consequently the number of probes used to interrogate each
splicing event, was considerably smaller in the Oryzon arrays
than in the GeneSplice arrays (40,000 vs. 6,000,000, respectively). This characteristic counterbalances the drawback of
shorter and less-speciﬁc probes. During the implementation
of ExonPointer we also found that the use of junction probes
(particularly those that skip the exon) was fundamental for the
success of the algorithm. Other aspects of ExonPointer deserve
to be mentioned. The main source of false positives was weakly
expressed sequences (i.e., probes with low signal) and the
ﬁltering of these probes drastically improved the results. The
combination of P values of several probes (as opposed to
the combination of signals of the probes) was proven to be
an effective approach to the quantiﬁcation of splicing events.
The algorithm exploits the redundancy of the junctions, and
effectively combines them with the exon probes. ExonPointer
is an extension of a linear model and, therefore, can be applied
to any experiment where a linear model holds (most of the
present algorithms are focused on case–control studies).
Finally, the characteristics of ExonPointer allow for a straight-

www.aacrjournals.org

forward implementation to other microarray platforms, provided that they contain exon and junction probes (e.g., the
GeneChip Human Transcriptome 2.0 array, recently launched
by Affymetrix).
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is an alternative genome-wide
approach used to characterize alternative splicing. The
RNA-seq technology is able to generate millions of reads
that can be mapped to the whole genome using speciﬁc
RNA aligners (38). This process requires a laborious tuning
of numerous parameters involved in each of the steps.
Using this approach, approximately 300 million reads would
be required to accurately quantify 90% of the transcriptome
in a single sample (39). With the decrease in cost and the
improvement in computing resources, read length and algorithms, RNA-seq will become a major player in the identiﬁcation of alternative splicing events, but, at present, storage
and computational requirements can be unaffordable if
the number of samples is high. Alternatively, if the focus
is on the detection of annotated splicing events in a reliable
and cost effective manner, a microarray platform with an
adequate design is a very viable option (16). Despite the
limitations of microarrays (e.g., the results are tied to the
probes that are included in the array design, based on
the existing annotations of gene structures), we have demonstrated that this technology performs well, requires only
modest computing power and is simple to interpret. In less
than 1 hour of analysis, ExonPointer obtained a remarkably
reliable list of differential splicing events.

The use of ExonPointer allowed us to study the alterations in
cassette exons caused by the downregulation of SRSF1 in lung
cancer cells. Upregulation of SRSF1 is frequent in cancer and
contributes to the oncogenic potential of H-Ras and Myc
(14, 40). Overexpression of SRSF1 in human non–small cell
lung cancers leads to a more invasive phenotype (15, 41).
Through the control of caspase-9 alternative splicing, SRSF1
also regulates the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to chemotherapy (42). The serine/arginine-rich proteins are best known
for their ability to promote exon inclusion (43). In accordance
with this observation, our results show that SRSF1 mainly
functions as a splicing repressor in A549 cells. This is also
consistent with the exon-skipping phenotypes of disease-associated mutations that affect the SRSF1-speciﬁc splicing motifs
(44). The splicing analysis described here also provides new
information on genes and functions regulated by SRSF1, which
helps to understand the transforming capacity of SRSF1. In our
study we identiﬁed a substantial number of splicing events in
genes related to RNA metabolism. This supports the data
reported by Sanford and colleagues, which showed an enrichment for genes that encode RNA binding proteins within a
group of alternative exons targeted by SRSF1 (45). In agreement with our functional analysis, the authors also found
enrichment for genes associated with biologic processes such
as cell division, apoptosis, and proliferation. To our knowledge,
the implication of SRSF1 in the regulation of alternative
splicing in genes related to developmental and hereditary
disorders is a novel observation. The association with functional annotations related to phosphoproteins and infection
also merit further attention.
In support of the validity of our approach, the ExonPointer
algorithm found statistically signiﬁcant differences in many

genes previously reported to be regulated by SRSF1 (14, 29–35).
Nevertheless, most of the splicing events that we found were
novel. Moreover, the analysis allowed us to identify 4 genes,
ATP11C, IQCB1, TUBD1, and PRRC2C, with a signiﬁcantly
different pattern of splicing in primary non–small cell lung
tumors. The association of these molecules with lung cancer
had not been previously reported, although, in the case of
PRRC2C, there was some information suggesting its role in
cancer. PRRC2C is ampliﬁed and overexpressed in bladder

cancer (46), and it has been related to proliferation and cellcycle regulation through an interaction with histone H4 transcription factor (47). We have now been able to identify a new
splice variant of PRRC2C, which is regulated by SRSF1 and is
overexpressed in primary lung tumors. We have also shown
that PRRC2C is able to regulate lung cancer growth in vitro.
Interestingly, in lung adenocarcinoma cells this activity is
mostly restricted to the splice variant overexpressed in primary
lung tumors. The SRSF1 protein has been reported to modulate

for an interaction between PRRC2C and MDM2 (48). The role
of the PRRC2C splice variants in the regulation of p53 by
MDM2 merits further investigation.
In conclusion, exon–junction microarrays, together with the
appropriate algorithm, provide a reliable analytical tool for
genome-wide examination of differential alternative splicing in
a time and cost-effective manner. This technology has allowed
us to identify new splicing events regulated by the oncogenic
splicing factor SRSF1, and some biologic pathways in which
this factor may have a signiﬁcant role. The use of this technology in other experimental and biologic conditions would
provide valuable information on the implication of alternative
splicing in normal and pathologic human biology.
