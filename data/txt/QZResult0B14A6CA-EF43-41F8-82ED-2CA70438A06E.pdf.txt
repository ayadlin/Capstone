The c-Met/hepatocyte growth factor receptor and its family members are known to promote cancer cell migration and invasion. Signaling within and beyond this pathway contributes to the systemic spread of metastases through induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, a process also implicated in mediating resistance to current anticancer therapies, including radiation. Induction of
c-Met has also been observed after irradiation, suggesting that c-Met participates in radiation-induced disease progression through
the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Therefore, c-Met inhibition is an attractive target for potentially mitigating radiation resistance.
This article summarizes key findings regarding crosstalk between radiotherapy and c-Met and discusses studies performed to date in

INTRODUCTION
c-Met, a receptor tyrosine kinase, has important roles in the malignant transformation of cancer cells. Also known as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, c-Met is a 170-kilodalton (kD) transmembrane protein that is activated by the binding of its ligand, HGF, to its extracellular region. At the time of ligand binding, c-Met activates downstream signaling
pathways that have been implicated in the invasion and migration of cancer cells. Several investigators have shown links
between c-Met signaling and cellular response to radiotherapy.
Radiotherapy, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, is the foundation of treatment for various solid tumors.
However, because of the proximity of critical normal tissues, tumoricidal radiation doses often cannot be used. Elevation
of c-Met has been noted in various tumors and is known to contribute to treatment resistance. Indeed, targeting c-Met has
shown promise for the treatment of various types of cancer and is currently being tested in phase 3 trials for non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC). In the current study, we review the current literature regarding c-Met and the potential use of
inhibitors of the HGF/c-Met axis to enhance the sensitivity of cancers to radiation.
c-Met Signaling

c-Met, a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, consists of a 45-kD a and a 150-kD b subunit.1 HGF, the only known
ligand, binds to the extracellular region, leading to receptor dimerization and phosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine kinase domains.2 The activation/phosphorylation of the intracellular domain prompts activation of downstream signaling,
mainly through the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and signal
transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathways (Fig. 1).1,3,4 Activation of c-Met has been implicated in cell
scattering, in which cells lose their contact with the surrounding cells and extracellular matrix, attain a mesenchymal phenotype, invade surrounding tissues, and proliferate. Cell scattering is crucial for wound healing, in which cells migrate to
sites of injury for tissue repair and reconstruction. Migration and invasion are also important in cancer progression, in
which epithelial cancer cells lose their cell-cell contacts and acquire a mesenchymal phenotype5,6 that circumvents anoikis
and allows the cells to invade through extracellular structures until they ultimately lodge at secondary sites.

C-Met Signaling and Radiation Response/Bhardwaj et al

Figure 1. Key components of c-Met signaling are shown. Activation of c-Met signaling triggers downstream responses in
the Ras-Raf-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase), phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt, and signal transducers
and activators of transcription (STAT) pathways, ultimately
enhancing cellular motility and invasion as well as angiogenesis and protection against apoptosis. After irradiation, activation of c-Met is increased by both hepatocyte growth factor
(HGF)-dependent and HGF-independent mechanisms. Irradiation also increases the transcription of both HGF and c-Met.

HGF/c-Met Expression in Cancer

HGF is produced by cancer cells7 and stromal cells,
including cancer-associated fibroblasts.8 The c-Met receptor is expressed mainly by epithelial cells,9 but also by
other cell types, including vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells,10 hepatocytes,11 and hematopoietic cells.12
The HGF/c-Met axis is dysregulated in many human neoplasms. Ectopic expression of the ligand, its receptor, or
both in human and mouse cells reportedly leads to tumorigenesis and promotes metastasis.13,14 Activation of c-Met
can also occur in a ligand-dependent autocrine manner.15,16 Other potential mechanisms for dysregulation of
the HGF/c-Met axis include gene amplification, receptor
overexpression, and activating mutations.17 The activation/upregulation of both HGF and its receptor is a negative prognostic indicator in various types of cancer.18-21
Raghav et al. reported high levels of c-Met and phosphorylated Met in several molecular subtypes of breast cancer.22 High levels of total and activated receptor have been
correlated with poor prognosis in terms of recurrence-free
and overall survival rates. In patients with gliomas, expression of HGF and c-Met correlates with tumor grade23,24
and elevated coexpression is correlated with recurrence of

meningioma.25 A comparison of unselected patients with
colon carcinoma revealed significant differences in
mRNA and protein levels of HGF and c-Met in tumor
versus normal mucosa. Overexpression of HGF and
c-Met mRNA were associated with lymph node metastasis
and disease stage.21 c-Met overexpression also was found
to be correlated with a shorter median progression-free
survival (PFS) and overall survival.26 HGF/c-Met expression has been implicated in the resistance of colorectal
cancer cell lines to the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) inhibitor cetuximab.27
Overexpression of c-Met mRNA has also been
found in both NSCLC and small cell lung cancer.28,29 In
patients with NSCLC, c-Met activation appears to be
associated with increased tumor differentiation and an
overall worse prognosis.30,31 Cappuzzo et al. found that
patients with NSCLC and amplified Met levels had
shorter survival times after surgical resection than patients
without Met amplification.32 Another group found significant correlations between high circulating levels of cMet in patients with NSCLC and nodal disease status and
early disease recurrence.28
The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in
relation to HGF/c-Met and radiation

HGF or scatter factor was first identified as a cytokine
that can dissociate a colony of cells into individual cells.33
Early studies found that HGF also increases cellular
migration and invasion33,34 via the urokinase plasminogen activator system.34 HGF/c-Met activation also induces EMT and is therefore important in embryogenesis and
organ regeneration. Expression of c-Met was found to be
increased in the epithelial cells of the developing mouse,
whereas the surrounding mesenchymal cells had high
HGF expression.35,36 EMT promotes cancer progression
via upregulating cancer cell migration, invasion, and, ultimately, angiogenesis. Activation of the HGF/c-Met axis is
known to promote invasive growth in both cell lines
and transgenic animal models of various types of
cancer.13,37,38 In patients with colorectal cancer,
c-Met expression can be induced by activation of the
Wnt-b-catenin pathway.39 Hypoxia also promotes the
invasive growth of cancer cells40; increases in the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1a (an oxygen
sensor that is stabilized in hypoxic environments) have
been associated with increased c-Met expression and HIF1a was inhibited by small interfering RNA (siRNA) to
c-Met.41 Because both Wnt signaling and hypoxia induce
the invasive phenotype, these findings further implicate cMet in promoting invasion. Jahn et al. recently
1769

Review Article

demonstrated that acquisition of EMT characteristics in
an in vivo model was correlated with upregulation of cMet mRNA and increased responsiveness to HGF.42
Radiotherapy is an integral component of the treatment of many solid tumors, and improvements in treatment planning and delivery have led to improvements in
local control and reductions in toxicity. However, systemic dissemination of disease continues to be a challenge in many types of tumors. As noted above, the
EMT contributes to tumor progression and metastasis.43,44 Cancer therapies such as radiotherapy have been
shown to contribute to the elevation of tumor growth
factor-b, a known inducer of EMT,45 which may lead to
the development of treatment resistance. Breast cancer
cells treated with  20 Gy begin to display changes consistent with the EMT.46 Additional studies have also
confirmed that sublethal doses of radiation prompt the
induction of EMT in various cancer cell lines.45 For
example, irradiated colorectal cancer cells undergo
changes characteristic of EMT,47 and patients with rectal
cancer show increased levels of mesenchymal markers
such as vimentin and fibronectin after chemoradiation
therapy.47 Thus far, the clinical assumption that a radiation-induced shift to the mesenchymal phenotype would
facilitate metastasis has not been borne out. Although
both preoperative and postoperative radiation can suppress local recurrence, the appearance of metastases does
not seem to differ between patients given preoperative
versus postoperative radiation for rectal cancer48 or soft
tissue sarcoma.49 Clearly additional research is needed to
clarify how radiation-induced EMT affects the biological
behavior of tumors in patients with cancer.
c-Met Signaling in Angiogenesis

Angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis are critical processes
in tumor development and metastasis. Activation of c-Met
signaling stimulates several cellular processes, including
morphogenesis, motility, tumor progression, proliferation,
survival pathways, and angiogenesis.10,50 Studies have
shown that c-Met can promote tumor angiogenesis in cell
lines and in preclinical models.51 The vascular endothelial
growth factor/receptor (VEGF/VEGFR) pathway is a key
mediator of tumor angiogenesis. HGF/c-Met signaling
can increase the expression of angiogenic mediators,
including VEGF/VEGFR family members, activating survival pathways, proliferation, and migration of vascular
endothelial cells. HGF can upregulate proangiogenic
factors (VEGF) and downregulate the expression of the
natural antiangiogenic protein thrombospondin-1, thereby
functioning as a regulator of the angiogenic switch.52 A
1770

vast body of evidence indicates that both the HGF and
VEGF pathways cooperate in inducing angiogenesis in
vitro and in vivo. c-Met and VEGFR can synergistically
activate common signaling downstream molecules, including extracelluar signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/MAPK,
AKT, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK).53 Similar to
VEGF, the expression of both c-Met and HGF is induced
by HIF-1a, suggesting a crucial contributory role for this
axis in promoting angiogenesis in microenvironments possessing low oxygen tension, such as tumors.41
c-Met Signaling in DNA Damage and Radiation
Response

A growing body of evidence has suggested that c-Met activation is also important in imparting cellular resistance to
DNA-damaging agents, including ionizing radiation.54
Fan et al. demonstrated that pretreating breast cancer cells
with HGF protected them from DNA fragmentation
induced by DNA-damaging agents. They further found
that this HGF-induced protection depended on both
dose and time and could be reversed by the HGF antagonist neurokinin-1 (NK1), a truncated form of the HGF
protein.55 That same group subsequently showed that
PI3K-Akt signaling is important in the way HGF protects
cells from DNA damage and suggested a signaling flow of
HGF!c-Met!PI3K!Akt!DNA repair.55 The mechanism behind HGF-induced prevention of DNA damage
was suggested to be upregulation of polycystic kidney disease-1 (PDK1, a survival-promoting component of cadherin-catenin complexes) and downregulation of 51C (an
inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase), TOPBP1 (a topoisomerase IIB-binding protein) , and doxorubicininduced Gu protein (which participates in RNA synthesis
and processing).56 Further support for the role of c-Met
in DNA repair came from a study by Medova et al.,57 in
which inhibition of c-Met with the small-molecule inhibitor PHA665752 and with siRNA in cell lines with abnormal c-Met signaling inhibited DNA repair by
homologous
recombination.
Treatment
with
PHA665752 also was found to prevent the formation of
the BRCA1-RAD51 complex involved in homologous
recombination-mediated DNA repair, presumably by
preventing radiation-induced accumulation of RAD51 in
the nucleus.57 In addition, HGF has been shown to inhibit c radiation-induced apoptosis in nontumor models
such as human umbilical vein endothelial cell cultures.58
Clinically, c-Met expression was found to be an
independent and significant predictor of impaired local
failure-free survival among patients undergoing definitive
radiation for squamous cell carcinoma of the

oropharynx,59 and HGF expression was found to be
inversely correlated with failure-free survival.59 Immunohistochemical analysis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma specimens from patients treated with radiotherapy found cMet to be a poor prognostic marker, with 5-year overall
survival rates of 84% to 48% for specimens with low versus high c-Met expression.60
Irradiation Upregulates c-Met Signaling

Similar to EGFR, c-Met levels are also upregulated in
irradiated cancer cells.61 De Bacco et al. found that irradiation increased the levels of c-Met in biphasic fashion
with respect to both radiation dose and time.62 Increases
in c-Met promoter activity and the phosphorylation of cMet with subsequent activation of the c-Met downstream signaling molecules GRB2-associated binding
protein 1 (Gab1) and MAPK, without increases in HGF
levels of the cells, after irradiation led the authors to suggest that activation of c-Met signaling at the time of irradiation is not ligand (HGF)-dependent.62 Qian et al.63
also demonstrated that irradiation increased c-Met levels
in a panel of pancreatic cancer cells; however, the
increase in c-Met was dose-dependent. Irradiation also
was found to increase the activation of c-Met and
increased the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer
cells in the presence of HGF.63
Although the studies noted above did not show
stimulation of HGF secretion at the time of radiation,
Chu et al. found that irradiation enhanced the secretion of
HGF by glioblastoma cells.64 They found that the glioblastoma cells with the highest basal levels of HGF were
the most radioresistant, leading them to suggest that the
radioresistance may have been related to the higher basal
HGF levels. Similarly, Schweigerer et al.65 found that irradiated neuroblastoma cells expressed higher levels of HGF
mRNA than unirradiated cells. It is interesting to note
that irradiation increased the invasiveness of neuroblastoma cells with high basal c-Met expression but not that
of cells with low basal c-Met expression.65
Collectively, these findings implicate c-Met in radiation-induced invasion and suggest that c-Met-targeting
Cancer

agents might be able to overcome radiation-induced
EMT and potentially sensitize cancer cells to radiation.
The known involvement of c-Met in cancer initiation
and progression has led to its being identified as a target
for therapy. Several groups have tried to identify which
cancer cell populations can be specifically targeted with
anti-c-Met agents.61,66,67 The effect of c-Met inhibition
on various aspects of cancer progression such as cellular
survival, EMT, invasion, migration, and angiogenesis has
been well studied.41,68 The importance of c-Met in
DNA repair has led to its being used as a target for sensitizing cancer cells to radiation as well. Inhibition of cMet by using small-molecule inhibitors and siRNA can
radiosensitize cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. We
found that glioma cells can be radiosensitized by
MP470, a small-molecule inhibitor of c-Met, and that
combining radiation with MP470 significantly increased
the percentage of apoptotic cells. This combination
affected the radiation-induced DNA damage response by
increasing the c-H2Ax foci and reducing Rad51 levels.69
In gastric carcinoma cells, radiosensitization by c-Met inhibition involved an increase in c-H2Ax levels and phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM). cMet inhibition, alone and in combination with radiation, reduced the phosphorylation of ataxia-telangiectasia-related (ATR) and checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) and
reduced radiation-induced S-phase arrest.70 Other studies in which HGF/c-met inhibition was used to radiosensitize cancer cells are mentioned in Table 1.71-75
Clinical Targeting of HGF/c-Met Signaling

Several therapeutic agents that target HGF/c-Met signaling are currently available. These agents act by blocking
either the c-Met receptor or the ligand HGF and include
both small-molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies and are being tested in a variety of solid tumors. A
recent review by Peters and Adjei mentions several agents
that are currently in clinical trials for their activity against
the HGF/c-Met signaling axis.76 Some of the agents
mentioned in the review include anti-HGF antibodies
such as ficlatuzumab, rilotumumab, and TAK-701; anti1771

Review Article

Met antibodies such as onartuzumab; and anti-Met tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as tivantinib, foretinib, cabozantinib, and others. For NSCLC, the only therapeutic
agent targeting c-Met that has been approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration to date is crizotinib, for
ALK-positive NSCLC.76 The following paragraphs summarize the status of some other c-Met–targeted therapeutics currently being developed.
Tivantinib (ARQ197) is a selective, small-molecule
c-Met blocker that is not competitive with adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Given the crosstalk between c-Met and
EGFR, and the potential for c-Met inhibition to overcome resistance to EGFR inhibitors, this agent is being
studied in combination with erlotinib. In one randomized
phase 2 trial, patients with refractory, stage IV NSCLC
were randomly assigned to receive erlotinib only or erlotinib plus tivantinib; the combination treatment resulted in
longer progression-free survival (PFS) time (16.1 weeks vs
9.7 weeks for erlotinib alone; hazard ratio [HR], 0.81
[95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.57-1.15])
(P ¼ .23). A planned multivariable Cox regression model
adjusting for prognostic factors (including histology and
genotype) yielded an HR for PFS of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.470.98 [P < .05]).77,78 The improvement in PFS was particularly prominent among patients with tumors of nonsquamous histology, wild-type EGFR, and mutated KRAS.
These promising findings have led to a phase 3 trial,
which is currently underway.
Another small-molecule inhibitor that had shown
promise is cabozantinib (XL184), which targets both cMet kinase and VEGF. Because the development of resistance to anti-VEGF therapeutic agents is known to be
mediated at least in part through the HGF/c-Met axis, the
strategy of targeting both pathways has gained considerable interest.79,80 This therapy has demonstrated singleagent antitumor activity in several types of solid tumors,
particularly androgen-resistant prostate cancer.81
Rilotumumab (AMG 102) is a fully humanized
monoclonal antibody (immunoglobulin G2) that specifically targets HGF and is being developed by Amgen Inc
(Thousand Oaks, Calif). It binds to amino acid residues
at the NH2-terminus of the beta-chain of human HGF,
with a preference for the mature, heterodimeric form,
leading to the complete inhibition of c-Met autophosphorylation.82 Unfortunately, it demonstrated no sign of activity when tested in a phase 2 trial of patients with
recurrent glioblastoma.83 Although the authors did not
speculate on the underlying cause of AMG 102’s inactivity, they suggested that pretreatment with anticancer
therapies including bevacizumab may have been responsi1772

ble. Because multiple tyrosine kinase receptors are active
in patients with glioblastoma, targeting only c-Met may
not improve PFS. Furthermore, the authors also suggested
that although unlikely, the blood-brain barrier may have
limited the transport of the drug.
DN30, developed by Metheresis Translational
Research SA (Lugano, Switzerland), is a monoclonal antibody targeting the extracellular domain of c-Met directly
at a site distinct from the binding site of its HGF ligand.84
Although treatment with DN30 significantly downregulates c-MET,85 the process is complicated by its bivalent
structure, which results in partial agonism of the c-Met
receptor and thus has hindered clinical development of
this agent.84
MetMAb (OA-5D5) from Genentech (South San
Francisco, Calif) is perhaps the furthest along in clinical
development at this time. MetMAb is a monovalent antibody specifically designed to prevent dimerization of the
receptor. In phase 2 clinical testing, erlotinib was tested
with or without MetMAb as second-line or third-line
treatment of patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC.
More than 120 patients were equally randomized to
receive the combination of erlotinib and MetMAb versus
erlotinib alone.86 Met-positive tumors were those in
which > 50% of tumor cells stained with an intensity of
2 or 3 on a scale of 0 to 3. Patients with this type of tumor who were treated with MetMAb plus erlotinib had a
trend toward improved overall survival (HR, 0.55;
P ¼ .11) and possibly PFS as well. It interesting to note
that the reverse was observed for patients with Met-negative tumors in that MetMAb plus erlotinib produced
worse overall survival compared with erlotinib plus placebo (HR, 3.02; P ¼ .02). Based on these positive results,
MetMAb currently is being tested in a phase 3 trial exclusively for patients with Met-positive tumors.
Given the encouraging findings from trials of targeted
therapies performed to date, particularly for patients with
high c-Met–expressing tumors, it is logical to expand these
findings by combining targeted therapeutic agents with cytotoxic agents such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both.
Furthermore, because blocking EGFR has also been found
to be effective in overcoming radiation resistance, blocking
both EGFR and c-Met in combination with radiotherapy is
an attractive therapeutic strategy to overcome resistance to
both EGFR inhibitors and radiation.
Conclusions

With ever-increasing numbers of studies linking it with
cancer progression, c-Met has become an attractive candidate for targeted anticancer therapy, often in combination

with chemotherapy. With tivantinib, a c-Met inhibitor
being tested with erlotinib in a phase 3 trial for the treatment of nonsquamous cell NSCLC (the MARQUEE trial
[Phase 3 Met inhibitor ARQ 197 plus Erlotinib vs Erlotinib plus placebo in NSCLC]), and with the emerging significance of c-Met in cancer, EMT, and DNA damage
repair pathways, the logical next step is to test c-Met–targeting agents in combination with radiotherapy in clinical
settings.
