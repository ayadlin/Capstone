ABSTRACT
Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine skin cancer.
Pathologic activation of PI3K/mTOR pathway and elevated expression of c-Myc are
frequently detected in MCC. Yet, there is no targeted therapy presently available for
this lethal disease. Recently, MLN0128, a second-generation dual TORC1/2 inhibitor
is shown to have therapeutic efficacy in preclinical studies. MLN0128 is currently
in clinical trials as a potential therapy for advanced cancers. Here we characterize
the therapeutic efficacy of MLN0128 in the preclinical setting of MCC and delineate
downstream targets of mTORC1/2 in MCC cellular systems. MLN0128 significantly
attenuates xenograft MCC tumor growth independent of Merkel cell polyomavirus.
Moreover, MLN0128 markedly diminishes MCC cell proliferation and induces apoptosis.
Further investigations indicate that senescence does not contribute to MLN0128mediated repression of xenograft MCC tumor growth. Finally, we also observe robust
antitumor effects of MLN0128 when administered as a dual therapy with JQ1, a
bromodomain protein BRD4 inhibitor. These results suggest dual blockade of PI3K/
mTOR pathway and c-Myc axis is effective in the control of MCC tumor growth. Our
results demonstrate that MLN0128 is potent as monotherapy or as a member of
combination therapy with JQ1 for advanced MCC.

there is no effective cure or targeted therapy for these
patients [4–6]. Nevertheless, our understanding of the
etiopathogenesis of MCC has greatly improved with the
detection of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) in 2008
[7, 8]. Although integration of MCV to the host genome
has been implicated in the pathogenesis, the exact role
of MCV in MCC carcinogenesis still remains an enigma
[4–6, 9, 10]. The ‘non-infectious’ etiology of MCC is
now being widely accepted as an additional mechanism
with frequent reporting of cases on MCV-negative MCC

INTRODUCTION
Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a lethal neuro­
endocrine cancer of the skin that commonly arises in
sun-exposed area, mainly the head and neck regions (1).
The incidence of MCC in recent years has been reported
to be on the rise globally [1, 2]. Approximately 50% of
these patients have metastatic disease at presentation
with a 5-year disease-associated mortality rate of
46%, far exceeding that of melanoma [3]. At present

[11–13]. Yet, many of the shared and convergent cell
signaling pathways of MCV-positive and MCV-negative
MCC are to be delineated [9, 11–14].
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is
an atypical integrative serine/threonine kinase and a
master regulator that governs cell growth, metabolism,
proliferation, autophagy, immune function, and apoptosis
[15–18]. mTOR kinase resides in two multiprotein
complexes, mTOR complex1 (mTORC1) and complex2
(mTORC2), which exhibit different subunit compositions
and execute distinct cellular function. Both mTORC1/2
are critical mediators of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/
AKT pathway and thus impact both downstream and
upstream of AKT activation. In particular, mTORC1
is responsible for regulating protein synthesis and
cell growth, whereas mTORC2 has been shown to
phosphorylate and activate AKT. Together, mTORC1/2
control cell growth, meta­bolism and cell survival [15].
Mounting evidence indicates that PI3K/Akt pathway is
inappropriately activated in many human cancers, thus
suggesting this as an attractive drug target [16, 19, 20].
Others and we have demonstrated activation of the
mTOR-signaling pathway in MCC [21–23]. Interaction
between eukaryotic translation initiation factor
4E-binding protein (4E-BP1) and MCV small T antigen is
thought to up-regulate mTOR pathway in MCV-positive
tumor [21]. Knock-down of mTORC1/C2 activities
significantly inhibits cancer cell proliferation in multiple
myeloma and other cancers [19, 24] [25–30].
The current focus on mTOR circuitry in cancers
came from clinical failures of first generation mTOR
inhibitors (rapamycin and its analogs), which mostly
inhibit mTORC1 complex, but are ineffective due to
feedback activation of mTORC2 complex [15, 16, 31, 32].
The second-generation inhibitors such as MLN0128
target both mTORC1 and mTORC2 and potently inhibit
feedback activation of Akt [33]. There is also an emerging
consensus that incomplete mTORC1 inhibition (especially
in the context of 4EBP1 phosphorylation) is equally or
more to blame for the weaker efficacy of rapalogs versus
active-site inhibitors. Future studies should help clarify
this anomaly. There is an increased interest in the efficacy
of MLN0128 since this dual inhibitor has been shown to be
potent against several human cancers, including prostate
cancer [34] and renal cell carcinoma [35]. Currently
MLN0128 is in clinical trial for advanced solid tumors
and hematological malignancies (http://ClinicalTrials.gov
Identifier NCT01058707). To the best of our knowledge,
MLN0128 has not been tested in preclinical setting of
MCC.
Since therapy resistance and relapse remains
a serious clinical problem, combination therapy is
considered a best strategy to combat some of the barriers
and escape mechanisms. A growing body of evidence
suggests that aberrations in epigenetics play an important

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

role in tumorigenesis [36]. Bromodomain (BRD) and
extra-C terminal (BET) domain protein family consists
of BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT which function as
epigenetic readers and gene expression regulators [37, 38].
We have shown a close association between BRD4 and
c-Myc expression in MCC [39]. Moreover, we have also
demonstrated that JQ1, an inhibitor of BRD4, exerts a
potent antitumor activity in MCC in a c-Myc-dependent
pathway [40]. Additional evidence in recent years links
epigenetic changes in BRD4 as a factor in leukemia,
lymphoma, lung adenocarcinoma and melanoma [38, 41–
43]. Convergence of c-Myc and PI3K/mTOR pathway is
also becoming evident in hematopoietic malignancies [44]
and breast cancer [45]. Collectively, these developments
suggest that many of the cell signaling pathways in cancer
cells are highly interconnected and can converge at
mTOR signaling and c-Myc expression. In this study, we
show that MLN0128 is a potent inhibitor of mTORC1/2
complex that effectively halts tumor growth, reduce cell
proliferation and increase apoptotic cell death. When used
along with JQ1 as a combination therapy, it exerted potent
anti-tumor effects in MCC.

RESULTS
Potent inhibition of tumor growth by mTORC1/2
inhibitor MLN0128
The immunodeficient NODscid gamma (NSG)
mouse strain used in this study lacks mature murine T or
B cells, and has absent complement activity and NK cell
deficiency [21, 22, 46]. We have chosen 3 MCV-negative
cell lines developed from the lymph node metastases of
individual MCC patients. These MCV-negative cell lines
share the characteristic MCC morphology and markers
as those in MCV-positive MCC cells [21, 22, 40]. MCV
positivity in both our tissues and cell lines was determined
by genomic PCR amplification followed by direct DNA
sequencing [21, 22]. In this report, we used three of our
MCV-negative cell lines (MCC-2, MCC-3 and MCC5), which were authenticated via STR DNA profiling
comparing cell lines with origin tumor tissues (Genetica
DNA Laboratories, Cincinnati, OH). MKL-1, a well
characterized MCV-positive cell line, was a gift from Dr.
Becker (University Clinic Essen, Germany). The tumor
engraftment efficiency in MCC was 100% for MCC-2,
MCC-3, MCC-5 and MKL-1 cell lines. Characterization
of MCC xenograft tumors revealed identical histologic
and molecular markers as to the originating cell lines.
Treatment with MLN0128 significantly impaired
xenograft tumor growth in three different MCC cell lines,
albeit in varying degree (Figure 1A). Differential response
to MCC-2, MCC-3, and MCC-5 suggest differences in
cellular molecular characteristics between cell lines and
their inherent susceptibility to mTOR inhibitory therapy.

Tumor bearing mice were treated with MLN0128 at 1 mg/kg/day or vehicle by oral gavage for seven days followed by a two-day rest.
B. Repressed MCC-3 xenograft tumor growth upon combined treatment with MLN0128 and JQ1. Tumor bearing mice were treated with
MLN0128 or vehicle at 1 mg/kg/day by oral gavage and JQ1 or vehicle at 50 mg/kg/day by i.p. injection for a period of 30 days. C. A more
effective reduction of MCC-3 xenograft tumor growth in the group treated with combined therapy. Fold-reduction of tumor growth was
calculated as average tumor growth of control group divided by average tumor growth of treatment group. Tumor growth was calculated as
final average tumor volume minus initial average tumor volume in each group.

The most significant reduction in tumor volume was
observed in MCC-3 xenograft tumors.

in Figure 2A, c-Myc overexpression was suppressed by
MLN0128 in MCC-3 and MCC-5 cells. With this finding,
we uncovered an additional transcriptional program that
suppresses c-Myc expression [41, 43]. Because c-Myc
and mTOR signaling converges at 4E-BP-1 in a c-Myc
driven lymphoma mouse model [47], we hypothesized
that a combination therapy with JQ1 and MLN0128 might
augment anti-tumor effect in our disease model. To this
end, we chose MCC-3 xenograft to test our hypothesis
since this particular MCC cells have the highest level of
c-Myc overexpression. As shown in Figure 1B, a 13.2fold reduction of tumor growth was observed in MCC3 xenograft tumors treated with combination therapy.

JQ1 augments the anti-tumor effects
of MLN0128
Our earlier studies demonstrated the antitumor
effects of JQ1 in c-Myc overexpressing MCC cells [40].
Because MCC-3 and MCC-5 cells overexpress c-Myc,
we were intrigued to examine if MLN0128 would also
affect c-Myc expression by an interconnected signaling
pathway. Accordingly, MCC-3 and MCC-5 cells were
treated with MLN0128 at 400 nM for 24 hours. As shown

Akt, mTOR and its downstream molecules 4E-BP1 and S6 in MCC-2, MCC-3, and MCC-5 xenograft tumors. Western blot analysis was
performed with indicated antibodies. Tubulin was used as a loading control. C. MLN0128 suppresses phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR and
its downstream molecules 4E-BP1 and S6 in MKL-1 xenograft tumors. Western blotting was performed with indicated antibodies. Actin
was used as loading control.

When treated with monotherapies, the anti-tumor effect
observed was significantly lower than combination therapy
(13.2-fold reduction in combination, vs. 7-fold reduction
in MLN0128 alone, vs. 6-fold reduction in JQ1 alone;
Figure 1C). Thus, our finding indicates that concomitant
inhibition of PI3K/mTOR and c-Myc might be a potential
therapeutic strategy in advanced MCC. Additionally,
this finding reveals important mechanistic insights into
tumor therapeutic resistance development and provides a
platform for testing other targeted therapies on PI3K/Akt/
mTOR and c-Myc axis to achieve a sustainable therapeutic
outcome.
In our earlier report, we observed that mTOR
and downstream targets were activated in MCC tumors
[21, 22]. Thus, we carried out subsequent Western blot and
immunohistochemical analyses of xenograft to elucidate
treatment-related cellular and molecular changes after
MLN-128 treatment. As expected, MLN0128 suppressed
mTORC1/2 and its downstream effector targets, as
evidenced by diminished phosphorylation of mTOR,
Akt, 4E-BP1 and S6 kinase (Figure 2B). MCV-positive
cell line MKL1 also had similar phospho-protein profile
as shown in Figure 2C. Reduced tumor volume in treated
group suggested that cell proliferation or cell death might
be altered in the xenograft. As shown in Figure 3, Ki67positive proliferating cells were significantly decreased by
MLN0128 at the treatment endpoint. In a similar fashion,
increased cell death as demonstrated by cleaved caspase-3
staining was found in the treated group, as shown in
Figure  3. As anticipated, p-mTOR was significantly
diminished in MLN0128-treated group.
To test if antitumor effects can be observed in MCVpositive MCC, we generated xenograft model using the

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

classic MCC cell line, MKL-1, which harbors MCV.
Similar to MKL-1 and other classic MCV-positive MCC
cell lines, the MCV-negative cell lines used in this study
also grow in cell clusters [40]. As shown in Figure 1A, both
MCV-negative and MCV-positive tumors responded to
MLN0128 treatment suggesting mTOR is dysregulated in
both infectious and non-infectious tumors. Taken together,
our results provide strong preclinical evidence implicating
mTOR and its downstream targets as important candidate
for therapeutic targeting in MCC. This is a meaningful
approach since PI3K/Akt/mTOR governs many critical
cellular events including metabolism, cell growth, cell
cycle, and inflammation. MLN0128, a potent ATP active
site inhibitor, is in clinical trials favored over several other
dual inhibitors due to its improved pharmacokinetics and
long-term metabolic stability [48, 49]. Previous studies
have shown mTOR activation via sustained-4E-BP1
phosphorylation by small T antigen of MCV and antitumor
effect of mTOR inhibition in MKL-1 cells [21]. In this
study, we focused on three MCV-negative MCC cell
lines to develop a molecular paradigm identifying major
pathways activated and potential therapeutic targets.

MLN0128 impaired mTORC1 and mTORC2
signaling in MCC cells
The development of MLN0128 has facilitated
therapeutic targeting of this clinically relevant pathway
and downstream components [34]. Furthermore,
MLN0128 has been demonstrated to have therapeutic
efficacy in several xenograft animal models of human
cancers alone or in combination with receptor tyrosine
kinase (RTK) inhibitors or PI3K/Akt inhibitor [25–30].

Blockade of mTOR pathway inhibited the
proliferative capacity of tumor cells

Previously we have shown that the mTOR pathway is
up-regulated in MCC tissues and primary MCC cell lines
[22]. To further elucidate the activation/inhibition of
the mTORC1/2 pathway, we performed in vitro culture
experiments with MCC cells followed by Western blot
analysis. We first treated MCC cells with or without
different concentrations of MLN0128 for 24 hours and
then examined the total and phosphorylated protein
profile of the targeted pathways by Western blotting.
Consistent with published reports on other solid tumors,
MLN0128 markedly inhibited phosphorylation of both
mTOR and its downstream effectors, including 4E-BP1
(Thr37/46) and S6 kinase (Ser235/236) in all three MCV
negative MCC cell lines (Figure 4A) [21]. As expected,
MLN0128 also abrogated p-Akt activity (Figure 4A) in
these cell lines. These results also correlate well with
Western blot data shown in Figure 2B and 2C using
xenograft tissues.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In Figure 1, we attributed phenotypic reduction of
tumor volume after mTOR blockade by MLN0128 to
decreased cell proliferation and increased cell death within
the tumor. To examine these possibilities, we studied
in vitro effects of mTORC1/2 inhibition by MLN0128
on cell viability and cell proliferation. For this, MCC-2,
MCC-3 and MCC-5 cells were treated with increasing
concentrations of MLN0128 for 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours,
respectively, and cell proliferation were analyzed utilizing
CCK-8 assay.
Results from these experiments with three MCC cell
lines showed a decreased cell proliferation over a 72-hr
period. The half maximal growth inhibitory concentration
(GI50) dose was determined by CCK-8 assay in all three
MCC cell lines. The GI50 for MCC-2, MCC-3 and

MCC-5 cells is 1200 nM, 400 nM and 500 nM,
respectively (Data not shown). The underlying
mechanism for this variation is not clear. In keeping with
this non-responder phenotype, subsequent experiments
were carried out at 800 nM for MCC-2 cell line alone.
To complement the results from short-term treatments,
we performed long-term colony formation assay to
determine if the inhibitory effects of MLN0128 were
sustained over time. Similarly, MLN0128 significantly
decreased the number of MCC cell colonies as compared

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to that of DMSO controls (Figure 4B). Collectively,
our in vitro experiments clearly show that blockade of
mTOR by MLN0128 inhibits MCC cell growth which
partly accounts for the phenotype reduction of tumor.
Additionally, the differential response observed among
MCC-2, MCC-3 and MCC-5 cells is further suggestive
of the heterogeneous nature of this tumor. While all three
cell lines share certain common cellular and molecular
characteristics, cancer initiation and other changes may
be individualistic.

Cell cycle arrest and augmentation of cell death
with mTOR blockade in MCC cells

Within the BH3-only proteins of the Bcl-2 family, Bim
contributes to resistance to various standard and novel
chemotherapeutic agents. Here we demonstrate that
treatment with MLN0128 resulted in significant increase
in the expression of Bim (Figure 6A and 6B). Western
blot analysis of other apoptotic proteins did not show
any significant changes among anti-apoptotic Bcl-2
family members (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1) or pro-apoptotic
proteins (Bak, Bax). Similarly, expression of other proapoptotic BH3-only proteins (Bid and Puma) also did
not alter significantly in all three MCC cells. Similar
to MCC, overexpression of Bim in myeloma cells has
been associated with poor prognosis [51]. Furthermore,
mechanistic studies using BH3 mimetics (ABT-737)
also suggested that Bim released from Bcl-2/Bcl-xL
accounts for pro-apoptotic activity of Bim. Additionally,
Bim inhibited autophagy by sequestering Beclin-1 at
microtubules [52]. Together, these results suggest that
a Bim-targeting strategy promotes increased apoptotic
cell death among cancer cells. These results were further
confirmed using gene expression studies. As shown in
Figure 6B, mTORC1/2 blockade by MLN0128 resulted
in significant increase of Bim mRNA levels in MCC cell
lines. Considering that Bim is traditionally characterized
as a direct ‘activator’ of Bax/Bak, we silenced Bim
expression in MCC cells by Bim shRNA followed by
MLN0128 treatment (Figure 6C). As expected, Bim
downregulation protected cells from MLN0128 induced
apoptotic cell death as examined by Annexin V binding
assay (Figure 6D and 6E), confirming the importance
of Bim in MLN0128 mediated apoptosis. We extended
these studies in vivo and results showed increased Bim
expression as evidenced from immunohistochemical
and Western blotting studies (Figure 7). Together,
these results suggest that MLN0128 induced apoptosis
is mediated through the up-regulation of BH3-only
protein Bim. FoxO class of forkhead proteins are
downstream targets of PI3K/Akt pathway [53]. Upon
phosphorylation by Akt, FoxO3a is inactivated and
accentuated in cytoplasm. Upon PI3K/Akt pathway
inhibition (decreased p-Akt), FoxO3a translocates into
the nuclei to regulate several cellular events including
cell-cycle arrest, cell differentiation, autophagy
and apoptosis [54]. To investigate whether similar
mechanism is operative in MCC, we examined FoxO3a
expression on MCC-2, MCC-3 and MCC-5 xenograft
tumors by immunohistochemistry. In agreement,
increased FoxO3a staining is detected in the nucleus
of MLN0128-treated xenograft tumors, as compared
to that in the control group (Figure 7). Interestingly,
there are concomitant increased Bim positive cells in
the MLN0128 treatment group, indicating a possible
mechanism of up-regulation of Bim expression via
FoxO3a activation. Further in vitro studies are needed
to dissect detailed mechanisms in apoptosis triggered by
MLN0128 in MCC cells.

Because cell proliferation is strictly controlled
by cell cycle checkpoints, we analyzed the mTORC1/2
blockade on cell cycle progression using BrdU
incorporation labeling method. Cell cycle analysis by
flow cytometry showed a significant reduction of cells
in the S-phase with a concomitant cell arrest at G0/
G1 after MLN0128 treatment in MCC cells (Figure
5A). No such cell cycle arrest events were observed in
vehicle alone treated control cells. Additionally, there
was a three-fold increase in sub-G1 population in MCC-3
(2.9% to 9.4%) and MCC-5 (2.1% to 9.5%), which are
due to apoptotic cell death (Figure 5A). As compared to
untreated controls there was only a marginal increased
in MCC-2 cells which was less responsive to MLN0128
treatment (7.1% vs 11.2% in treated group) suggesting
MCC-2 has a resistant phenotype. When examined by
Annexin-V assay for apoptosis, the total apoptotic cell
death also found increased significantly in all three
cell lines and in particular MCC-3 and MCC-5 (Figure
5B). To identify regulators of cell cycle checkpoint
controls perturbed by MLN0128, we examined the
expression of cyclin D1, p21, p27 and p57 by Western
blot analysis. As shown in Figure 5C, the level of
cyclin D1, which regulates the G1/S transition through
the cell cycle, was decreased significantly after 24 hr
treatment with MLN0128 in all the three MCC cell lines
examined. Additionally, MLN0128 treatment resulted
in the expression of cell cycle inhibitor p27 without any
change in the protein expression of p21 and p57. Taken
together, these results suggest that mTORC1/2 inhibitorassociated cell cycle effects were mediated via cyclin D1
down-regulation with concomitant up-regulation of p27.
In addition to anti-proliferative effects, TORC1/2
inhibition by MLN0128 induces cell death in other types
of cancer.
Furthermore, apoptotic cell death was also markedly
increased with the incubation of MLN0128 in the culture.
MLN0128 at the concentration of 800 nM increased the
fraction of late apoptotic MCC-2 cells from 15.8% to
27.4%. In comparison, MCC-3 and MCC-5 cells were
more sensitive even in the presence of 400 nM MLN0128.
MCC-3 and MCC-5 cells undergoing cell death increased
from 1.9% to 10.8% and from 2.6% to 10.9%, respectively
(Figure 5B). Moreover, increased cleavage and activation
of PARP, caspase-3 and caspase-7 by Western blotting is
indicative of increased apoptotic cell death (Figure 5D).

of mTOR blockade

family of proteins contributes significantly to relapse
and drug resistance to various cancer therapies [50, 51].

Absence of senescence in MCC xenograft tumors
treated with MLN0128

we demonstrated increased PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling
output in MCC tumors [21, 22]. In the current study, we
targeted both PI3K/Akt/mTOR and c-Myc-dependent
pathways using in vivo and in vitro models of MCC. We
focused on the therapeutic efficacy of MLN0128, a second
generation dual inhibitor of mTORC1/2 and its molecular
downstream targets in MCC. Our earlier work uncovered
c-Myc overexpression in MCC and demonstrated that
JQ1 exerts anti-tumor effect in MCC by suppression
of c-Myc [40]. These findings gave us the scientific
rationale to focus on mono- and combination therapies,
and identify signaling pathways perturbed by MLN0128
and JQ1. We used a combination of cellular, molecular
and immunohistochemical techniques to elucidate these
molecular drug targets in MCC and the underlying
mechanisms involved.
The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling axis is central to
the carcinogenesis in many human cancers including
melanoma, AML, prostate, colon, breast and non-small
lung cancer. Hyperactivation of Akt, a serine/threonine
kinase, is one of the most commonly activated oncogenic
proteins in human cancers and mTORC2 directly
phosphorylates Akt at S473 [16, 55]. While examining the

We wondered whether induction of senescence
by MLN0128 therapy is a mechanism for repressed
xenografts tumor growth. β-galactosidase activity
at pH 6.0 has been used as a surrogate marker for
senescence, and we examined this aspect in MCC-3
and MCC-5 xenograft tissue sections in the treatment
group. First, we experimentally induced senescence in
MCF-7 breast cancer cells by etoposide followed by
β-galactosidase staining. A distinct blue color staining
is indicative of β-galactosidase activity. In comparison,
no β-galactosidase positive cells (blue) were detected in
both xenograft tumors examined, suggesting senescence
is not a mechanism by which MLN0128 inhibits MCC
tumor growth (supplementary Figure S1).

DISCUSSION
Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a lethal
neuroendocrine cancer of the skin for which there is no
effective cure or targeted therapy [4, 44]. Previously,

role of mTOR in cancer, rapamycin-insensitive mTORC2
complex was discovered and is now being targeted by
second generation dual inhibitors such as MLN0128
that directly phosphorylates Akt at S473. We, and others
have demonstrated aberrations of mTOR signaling in
MCC [21, 22, 56–58]. Thus, targeting PI3K-Akt-mTOR
signaling axis through ATP-competitive ‘active-site’
is a promising approach [15, 16, 59–61]. In agreement,
MLN0128 blocks phosphorylation of Akt at S473 in a dose
dependent fashion, which is further confirmed by in vitro
experiments such as cell proliferation, colony formation,
and most importantly MLN0128 repressed tumor growth
in xenograft MCC mouse models. Mimicking human
cancers, the MCC cell lines investigated in this study
also exhibit heterogeneity and differential responsiveness
to MLN0128 both in vitro and in vivo experiments.
Consistent with previous findings, MLN0128 not only
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

down-regulated mTORC1 activity as evidenced from
decreased phosphorylation of mTOR, S6 kinase, and 4EBP1, but also decreased mTORC2 activity via decreased
phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473. Though MLN0128
suppressed 4E-BP1 activities in all 3 MCC cell lines
investigated, greater inhibitory effect on mTOR was
observed with MCC-3 cell line.
To correlate and to better understand the antitumor effects of MLN0128 at the cellular level, we
studied proteins associated with apoptosis and cell cycle
progression. mTOR kinase inhibitors are known to induce
cell cycle arrest and cause cytotoxicity, depending on
the tumor cell type [62]. Our results have demonstrated
a decreased expression of cyclin D1, a known stimulator
of G1 cell cycle progression, and overexpression of
p27, a cell cycle breaker. No appreciable change was
observed in the expression of p21 or p57 after MLN0128

treatment. Thus, MLN0128 selectively disrupts CDK
complexes that require p27 as an assembly factor in
MCC cells but not those that require p21. Additionally,
we have demonstrated increased apoptosis by MLN0128
as evidenced from activation of caspase-3, caspase-7 and
PARP in MLN0128-treated group.
Cancer cells evade apoptosis by multiple
mechanisms. BH3-only protein Bim and Puma are
necessary for MLN0128-induced lymphoid cell death
in vitro (human cells) and in vivo (mice) [19, 25, 30].
Moreover, knockdown of Bim or Puma by RNA
interference could completely eliminate MLN0128induced cell death [30]. In agreement with the pivotal role
played by Bcl-2 family proteins in the intrinsic apoptotic
pathway, we have found that only Bim is up-regulated at
the mRNA and protein level after MLN0128 treatment.
Further silencing Bim by shRNA has dramatically
protected MCC cells from MLN0128-induced cell death,
which implies Bim is a critical factor in MLN0128
mediated cell death. Collectively, these findings highlight
the fundamental importance of mTOR in MCC cell
proliferation and reinforce the notion that subsets of MCCs
are dependent on deregulated mTOR activity. Another
corollary of these findings is that therapeutic agents
that up-regulated Bim may prime therapy-resistant cells
toward cell death. Since a number of pro-apoptotic genes
including FasL, Bim and PUMA are regulated by FoxO
proteins [63], we examined whether this is the case upon
MLN0128 treatment. Our in vivo data suggests that FoxO
activation as demonstrated by increased nuclear retention
of FoxO3a detected in MLN0128-treated xenograft, may
be linked to increased Bim expression and increased
apoptosis. Further in vitro studies are needed to dissect
the mechanisms of increased apoptosis upon MLN0128
treatment in MCC. Interestingly, MLN0128 treatment does
not induce senescence in MCC xenograft tumors [64].
Interestingly, Moore’s group has shown that
sustained 4E-BP1 phosphorylation found in MCV-positive
MCC is attributed to small T antigen [21]. Together,
MCV-positive and MCV-negative cancers may have
shared abnormalities in oncogenic signaling though the
underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, and
targeting mTOR pathway may be therapeutic in MCC
regardless of MCV status [40, 65, 66].
Finally, the complexity of PI3K/Akt/mTOR net­
work provides a rationale for combination therapies.
Coincident ERK activation is reported in HER2-positive
breast cancer cell lines after MLN0128 treatment and
better xenograft tumor regression is accomplished by
dual mTOR and HER2 blockade [67]. Elevated c-Myc
expression in cancers has been shown to be associated
with changes in chromatin structure, ribosome biogenesis,
metabolic pathways, and apoptosis, among others [66].
Moreover, aberrant epigenetic modifications including
DNA methylation and histone modifications have also

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

been shown to contribute to cancer and inflammation [68].
Furthermore, an additive antitumor effect on breast cancer
cells was observed when combining mTOR inhibitors with
histone deacetylases (HDACs) [45]. Likewise, a significant
anti-tumor effect was also evident when MLN0128
was administered as a dual therapy along with JQ1, a
BRD4 inhibitor that also targets c-Myc transcriptional
amplification in MCC. In spite of these advances, we are
just beginning to appreciate the complexity of the mTOR
network and downstream targets. Defining these complex
and cell-type-specific interactions in MCC cell lines might
open the door to new therapeutic strategies.
There are many limitations in extrapolating the
laboratory data from xenograft mouse models to the clinic.
In human disease, defective tumor immunity is considered
one of the hallmarks of cancer. In most cancer types,
immune effector cells actively participate in shaping the
tumor growth or its elimination. The NSG mouse strain
used in this study lacks a functioning immune system,
which is a limitation to correctly interpret the data.
Several lines of evidence indicate that mTOR pathway
regulates both innate and adaptive immune function.
In particular, CD4+, CD8+ T-effector cells, Tregs and
myeloid suppressor cells are greatly influenced by PI3K/
mTOR pathway [69]. While rapamycin is a well-known
immunosuppressant, mTORC2 inhibitor can exert a
beneficial anti-tumor immunity by modulating Tregmediated immunosuppression. Furthermore, therapeutic
benefits of many conventional and novel therapies relies,
at least, in part on stimulating anti-tumor immunity [70].

and W is width as described before [72]. Experimental
endpoints were determined by one of the following: (1)
completion of treatment course, (2) attainment of tumor
burden exceeding 2 cm in any dimension, or (3) further
complications affecting animal welfare. Upon reaching
experimental endpoints, mice were euthanized humanely,
and tumors were excised and dissected for characterization
and mechanistic studies. Tumor growth was calculated
as average final volume minus average initial volume
for each experiment group. The Institutional Committee
approved the experimental design and the drug-dosing
regimen.

MCC cells were maintained in complete RPMI
1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 4 mM L-glutamine, 12.5 mM HEPES and antibio­
tics (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). These cultures
were maintained in a dedicated CO2 incubator at 37°C.
Cells were fed with fresh medium every other day and
cultures were split 1:2 weekly to maintain logarithmic
growth. Human embryonic kidney 293T/17 cells (ATCC,
Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS
and 5 mg/ml of sodium pyruvate.

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed on achi­
eved, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue.
Immunostaining was performed on 5-μm tissue section
slides as described previously [21, 22]. Briefly, slides
were deparaffinized, dehydrated and processed for
antigen retrieval followed by blocking non-specific sites
with 10% normal goat serum at RT for one hour. After
washes, slides were incubated with primary antibodies
for p-mTOR (Ser 2248) (1:100), Ki67 (1:400), cleaved
caspase-3 (1:100), FoxO3a (1:50) and Bim (1:100) at 4°C
overnight, respectively. After the washing steps, sections
were incubated with biotinylated secondary goat antirabbit antibody (1:200) for one hour at RT. Subsequently,
sections were treated with Vector Elite ABC-HRP reagent
(Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) followed by incubation
for 5 min in DAB peroxidase substrate (Vector Labs) for
color development. Sections were counterstained with
hematoxylin and immunostained slides were viewed on an
Olympus BX51 Research System Microscope by 20x and
40x UPlanApo air objective lenses (Olympus America).
Images were photographed using a high-resolution
interline CCD camera (CoolSNAP, Photometrics) and data
acquired with automated microscopy acquisition software
(MetaMorph version 7.7; Molecular Devices). Positively
stained cells were quantified at × 400 magnification and 5
randomly chosen fields per slide and four slides per group
were quantified for each staining. The data were presented
as the proportion of positively stained cells over the total
number of cells.

Animal studies: Xenograft transplantation
in NSG mice
Immunodeficient NOD/SCID/IL2r-γnull mice
(strain #5557) were generated by Jackson Laboratories
(Bar Harbor, ME) and their genetic and immunological
characteristics published [71]. Five-week old female NSG
mice were purchased periodically and maintained in the
university animal facility. All animal experiments were
performed under a protocol approved by the university’s
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, in
accordance with NIH guidelines. MCC cells were prepared
from logarithmically growing stock cultures by suspending
2 × 107 cells in 80 μl of media + 120 μl of Matrigel (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and injection sites were
prepared by shaving and sterilization with alcohol wipes.
Mice received subcutaneous injections of primary human
MCC cells on right rear flanks and palpable tumor growth
appeared within ~7 days of inoculation, and treatment
protocol began when tumors reached approximately 100
mm3 in volume.

Xenograft drug treatments: In vivo study
Tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into
appropriate control and treatment groups (n ≥ 4 for each
condition) receiving single- or dual-agent therapies. For
single-agent therapy, mice received oral administration
of 1 mg/kg/day MLN0128 (mTOR inhibitor) or vehicle
(5% N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), 15% polyvinyl
pyrrolidone (PVP) in water). The control and treatment
groups received their respective treatments via oral
gavage for seven days, followed by two-day rest, for a
total of twenty-seven days. For dual-agent therapy, mice
received MLN0128 or vehicle by oral gavage and 50 mg/
kg/day of JQ1 (10% cyclodextrin in water) or vehicle
(10% cyclodextrin in water) by i.p. injection. Drug
treatments began when xenograft tumors approached
~100 mm3 in volume. Mice were monitored daily,
tumors were measured with digital calipers, and tumor
volume was calculated as L/2 x W2, where L is length

Methylcellulose colony assay
Clonogenic cell formation was assayed by culturing
MCC cells in complete methylcellulose (Stem Cell
Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 3000 MCC cells were
resuspended in 1 ml complete methylcellulose plated in
35 mm plates and then incubated in a humidified CO2
incubator set at 37 °C. Colonies (CFU) consisting of at
least 40 cells was scored under microscope on day 21
post-seeding.

Gene expression analysis of bim by qRT-PCR

MCC cells were plated in 6 well plates (1 × 106 per well)
and treated with mTOR inhibitors for 24 hours. Cells were
harvested, washed in PBS and stained with Annexin-V and
propidium iodide (PI) cocktail as per the manufacturer’s
protocol. Control cells were incubated in 1x binding
buffer and stained with Annexin-V or PI alone. Cells
were analyzed in FACSAria (BD Biosciences) within an
hour of staining. Cell death was scored by the following
criteria set by appropriate gating: (a) early apoptotic cells
(PI negative, FITC Annexin-V positive), (b) late apoptotic
cells or dead cells (double positivity for both FITC
Annexin-V and PI), and (c) live cells (double negative for
Annexin-V and PI) and statistical analysis was performed
using FACSDiva software.

RNA was isolated from MCC cells with RNeasy
kit (Qiagen). cDNA was generated from MCC mRNA
using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit
(Life Technologies). RT-PCR was performed in MCC
cells as described previously using specific primers for
CK7, 18, 19, 20, neuron specific enolase, synaptophysin
and Math-1. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRTPCR) was performed with a StepOne Plus Real-Time PCR
System (Applied Biosystems). The following TaqMan
Gene Expression Assays were used: Hs.469658 (Bim)
and Hs.211334 (MRPS2). Triplicate runs of each sample
were normalized to MRPS2 mRNA to determine relative
expression.

Cell cycle analysis

Western blotting

For cell cycle analysis, MCC cells were seeded
at a cell density of 1 x106 per well in 6-well plates,
treated with mTOR inhibitors for 48 hours, and labeled
with 10 μM bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for 2 hours as
described before [40]. BrdU incorporation in these cells
was detected using Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated mouse
anti-BrdU antibody followed by 7-AAD staining as per
the manufacture’s protocol (BD Biosciences). At least
20,000 cells were acquired for each treatment condition
and cell cycle analysis was performed in the FACSAria
flow cytometer using FACS-Diva software. The cell cycle
distribution was reported as the percentage of cells in the
G0/G1, S, and G2/M populations.

Western blotting was performed essentially as described
previously [40]. Briefly, cells were harvested and washed
with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1xRIPA buffer containing 1
mM DTT and Complete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor
cocktail and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. Cell lysates were
clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C
and protein concentration was measured using protein assay
kit (Bio-Rad). Lysates (20 μg/lane) were electrophoresed in
8% or 12% SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and transferred
onto PVDF membrane by a semi-dry system (Bio-Rad)
and reacted with optimal concentrations of specific primary
antibodies at 4°C overnight followed by secondary antibodies
conjugated with HRP (Cell Signaling) for 1 hour at room
temperature. Visualization of immunoreactive proteins was
achieved with ECL chemiluminescence detection system
(Millipore, Billerica, MA). Alpha-tubulin was used as
loading control. Similarly, xenograft tumor tissues harvested
from mice were homogenized in 2% SDS lysis buffer
and processed for Western blotting as described above.
Immunoblotting data represent contiguous lanes.

Gene silencing of bim by shRNA method
Lentivirus-based short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
system is an efficient gene delivery tool to functionally
silence genes in mammalian cells. Lentivector containing
shRNA specific for Bim (TRCN0000029119) and nontargeting plasmid pLKO.1 scramble shRNA (plasmid
#1864; negative control vector) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and Addgene (Cambridge, MA)
respectively. ShRNA-encoding lentivirus was packaged
in 293T/17 cells to generate viral particles as described
before [73]. Viral supernatants were collected from these
cells 48 hours after transfection. Viral particles were
recovered after ultracentrifugation and resuspended in
PBS. After spinocculation, MCC cells were transduced
with lentivirus supernatant for 48 hours in fibronectincoated 6-well plates in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene.
Since lentiviral shRNA particles also encode for a
puromycin resistance gene for transduction selection,
cells were washed and grown in culture media containing
2 μg/mL puromycine dihydrochloride for an additional
72 hours. The remaining successfully transduced cells
were allowed to recover and proliferate for at least 2 days
before any experimental procedure.

Cell proliferation and cell viability
Cell proliferation and cell survival was assessed
using Cell Counting Kit-8 (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, MCC cells were plated
at 10,000 cells per well in a 96-well plate, allowed to attach
overnight, and then exposed to various concentrations of
MLN0128. Plates were incubated for 12, 24, 48 and 72
hours at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. At the end of incubation
period, CCK-8 (10% v/v) was added to each well and
incubated for another 4 hours at 37°C. The absorbance at
450 nm was measured using a microplate reader.

Determination of apoptosis by flow cytometry
Apoptotic cell death was determined using Annexin
V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences). Briefly,

Senescence was assessed using a commercially
available beta-galactosidase staining kit according to
the manufacturer’s protocol (Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, MA, # 9860). Briefly, 8-μm frozen tissue sections
were made and air dried for 10 minutes. The slides
were fixed for 15 minutes in 1x fixative solution
(formaldehyde-glutaraldehyde mix), followed by PBS
washes, and incubated overnight with beta-galactosidase
staining solution in a dry incubator at 37 °C with no CO2
supply to prevent false positivity. Sections were viewed
under microscope for blue color development and were
photographed for image analysis. As a positive control,
MCF-7 breast cancer cell line (ATCC, Catalog #HTB-22)
was experimentally induced for senescence by incubating
with 12.5 μM of etoposide for 24 hours. Next, etoposide
was removed and cells were cultured in fresh media for
4 days. Changes in morphology were assessed daily and
on the 5th day cells were fixed followed by staining per
manufacturer’s instructions. Subsequently, both MCF-7
cells and tissue sections were counterstained with nuclear
red to visualize nuclei (Sigma-Aldrich, #N3020, St Louis,
MO). Development of distinct blue color is indicative of
senescence.

To our knowledge, this is the first study
demonstrating the therapeutic efficacy of mTORC1/2
blockade on MCC by MLN0128. We also demonstrate
dual inhibition of mTOR and BRD4 led to a better antitumor effect in c-Myc overexpressing MCC tumors. As
PI3K and mTOR pathways as well as their close proximity
to immunotherapies are defined, effective therapies can
be developed for MCC. Future cancer genomic studies
may lead to better cancer biomarkers and evidence-based
patient management.
