Abstract

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive and incurable disease. Poor prognosis
is due to multiple reasons, including acquisition of resistance to gemcitabine, the first line
chemotherapeutic approach. Thus, there is a strong need for novel therapies, targeting more
directly the molecular aberrations of this disease. We found that chronic exposure of PDAC cells
to gemcitabine selected a subpopulation of cells that are drug-resistant (DR-PDAC cells).
Importantly, alternative splicing of the pyruvate kinase gene (PKM) was differentially modulated
in DR-PDAC cells, resulting in promotion of the cancer-related PKM2 isoform, whose high
expression also correlated with shorter recurrence free survival in PDAC patients. Switching PKM
splicing by antisense oligonucleotides to favour the alternative PKM1 variant rescued sensitivity of
DR-PDAC cells to gemcitabine and cisplatin, suggesting that PKM2 expression is required to
withstand drug-induced genotoxic stress. Mechanistically, up-regulation of the polypyrimidinetract binding protein (PTBP1), a key modulator of PKM splicing, correlated with PKM2
expression in DR-PDAC cell lines. PTBP1 was recruited more efficiently to PKM pre-mRNA in
DR- than in parental PDAC cells. Accordingly, knockdown of PTBP1 in DR-PDAC cells reduced
its recruitment to the PKM pre-mRNA, promoted splicing of the PKM1 variant and abolished drug
resistance. Thus, chronic exposure to gemcitabine leads to up-regulation of PTBP1 and
modulation of PKM alternative splicing in PDAC cells, conferring resistance to the drug. These

Introduction
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive human cancers,
being characterized by very low 5-year survival rate (1). Lack of early symptoms and late
diagnosis contribute to poor prognosis, with most patients presenting with metastasis. When
surgical resection is unfeasible, chemotherapy with gemcitabine, administered either alone
or in combination with other compounds, represents the clinical option for PDAC.
Nevertheless, relapse always occurs with more aggressive features and insensitivity to
chemotherapy, contributing to high lethality (2,3). Thus, identification of new diagnostic
markers and elucidation of the molecular pathways involved in acquisition of drug resistance
represent clinical priorities for PDAC (2,4).

Adaptation to variable stresses is a key feature of neoplastic cells. Recent evidence
highlighted how cancer cells can flexibly modulate gene expression at the level of alternative
splicing (AS) to withstand hostile conditions (5-8). In this regard, changes in expression of
some splicing factors have been directly linked to expression of oncogenic splice variants
that confer various advantages to cancer cells (9-14). Moreover, genotoxic stress was shown
to modulate splicing regulation (15), in some cases by affecting the localization or activity of
specific splicing factors, such as SAM68 (16) or EWS (17). In the case of PDAC cells, it
was previously shown that increased expression of the serine/arginine (SR)-rich protein
kinase SRPK1, a prototypic splicing factor kinase, confers resistance to treatment with
gemcitabine (18). Notably, since SRPK1 modulates the activity of several SR protein
splicing factors with implication in cancer (19), including SRSF1 (20), it is likely that upregulation of this kinase contributes to the expression of oncogenic splice variants expressed
in PDAC cells (21).
Herein, we aimed at investigating the role of AS and splicing factors in the acquisition of a
drug-resistant (DR) phenotype in PDAC cells. We observed that chronic treatment with
gemcitabine promoted the formation of DR subpopulations highly resistant to drug-induced
genotoxic stress. In order to understand the contribution of AS to the DR phenotype, we
analyzed a group of cancer-related splice variants involved in oncogenic features (5-8). We
found that DR-PDAC cells exhibited a switch in PKM AS, a gene encoding two alternative
splice variants, PKM1 and PKM2, through usage of mutually exclusive exons. PKM2 is
typically expressed in cancer cells where it confers oncogenic features (22-24). We show
that splicing of PKM2 is favoured in DR-PDAC cells with respect to the parental cells and
promotes drug resistance, as interference with this splicing event in DR-PDAC cells restored
sensitivity to gemcitabine and cisplatin. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the
polypyrimidine-tract binding protein PTBP1 is up-regulated in DR-PDAC cells and that its

increased recruitment to the PKM pre-mRNA promotes PKM2 splicing. Knockdown of
PTBP1 in DR-PDAC cells reduces its binding to PKM pre-mRNA, favours the expression of
PKM1 and rescues drug sensitivity. Hence, our results indicate a positive role for PTBP1 and
PKM2 in the acquisition of drug resistance, suggesting that this regulatory pathway
represents a novel potential therapeutic target for PDAC.

Results
Isolation of drug-resistant (DR)-PDAC cells
To isolate drug-resistant (DR) PDAC cell sub-populations, we exposed to chronic treatment
with gemcitabine (10 μM) two cell lines: Pt45P1, which displays higher sensitivity to the
drug, and PANC-1, which is more resistant to treatment (Supplementary Figure 1A). As
expected, gemcitabine caused massive cell death in both cell lines in the seven days of
treatment. However, 15 days after removal of the drug, few viable clones were visible in the
plates of both cell lines. Clones were pooled, amplified and cultured by exposing them to a
24 hour-pulse of gemcitabine every other week to maintain selection of the DR populations
(Figure 1A,B).

To confirm that DR-PDAC cells were indeed more resistant to drug treatment than the
parental cell line (PCL), we analyzed cell survival by colony formation assays. PCL- and
DR-PDAC cells were cultured for 24 hours with sub-optimal doses of gemcitabine and then
allowed to grow in complete medium until they formed visible colonies (Figure 1C,D).
Treatment with gemcitabine reduced the number of colonies in a dose dependent-manner in
PCL cells, whereas DR cells were resistant to the lower dose of gemcitabine and less
sensitive to the higher dose (Figure 1C,D). Analysis of cell death by trypan blue cell count
or by immunofluorescence analysis of the cleaved/activated form of caspase-3 confirmed
that gemcitabine was more cytotoxic for PCL- than DR-PDAC cells (Supplementary Figure
1B,C). Collectively, these results indicate that the selected cell populations have acquired a
drug-resistant phenotype.
PKM splicing is regulated in DR-PDAC cells
Recent evidence suggests a key role for mis-regulation of AS in the acquisition of oncogenic
features and drug-resistance by human cancer cells (5-8). Thus, we tested whether PCL- and
DR-PDAC cells display changes in splice variants of a subset of cancer-relevant genes. We
selected a group of genes whose AS was reported to promote oncogenic features in cancer
cells, such as the apoptotic genes CASP9 (25), CASP2 (26), BCL-X (27), BIM (28) and
FAS (29) (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure 2A), genes involved in DNA repair and
drug resistance, such as USP5 (30) and MKNK2 (31,32) (Figure 2B and Supplementary
Figure 2B), genes affecting basal metabolism, such as PKM (22) (Figure 2C), genes
involved in cell migration and invasion, such as RON (10), CD44 (5), and c-MET (33)
(Figure 2D and Supplementary Figure 2C) or the cell cycle gene CCND1 (34) (Figure 2E).
RT-PCR analysis showed that AS of most of these genes was either unchanged between
PCL- and DR-PDAC cells (CASP2, CCND1, c-MET, USP5, MKNK2 and RON) or not
modulated in the same direction in DR-PDAC cell lines (CASP9, BCL-X, BIM, CD44 and
FAS) (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 2). On the contrary, splicing of the PKM2 variant

was favoured with respect to PKM1 in both DR-PDAC cell lines (Figure 2C), suggesting
that modulation of PKM AS correlated with acquisition of drug resistance in PDAC cells.

We focused on the regulation of PKM AS because growing evidence supports a key role for
this splicing event in tumorigenesis (22,35). The PKM2 splice variant is prevalently
expressed in cancer cells (22,36), where it regulates processes spanning from cell
metabolism (22,24), to transcription (23), cell cycle (37) and cell death (38,39). Differential
expression of PKM1 and PKM2 in DR-PDAC cells was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis
using primers positioned either in exon 9 (PKM1) or 10 (PKM2) to amplify each splice
variant (Figure 3A). Furthermore, the switch in PKM splice variants was confirmed at the
protein level, as DR-PDAC cells expressed higher levels of PKM2, whereas PKM1 was
almost undetectable with respect to PCL-PDAC cells (Figure 3B). Notably, PANC-1 cells,
which are more resistant to gemcitabine (Supplementary Figure 1A), also express higher
levels of PKM2 and lower levels of PKM1 than the more sensitive Pt45P1 cells (Figure 3C).
These observations indicate that the DR phenotype of PDAC cells correlates with increased
expression of PKM2.

To assess the relevance of PKM2 in vivo, we investigated its expression levels by
immunohistochemistry in a cohort of 42 patients diagnosed with primary PDAC in the
absence of metastases, who received radical surgery and subsequent gemcitabine-based
adjuvant treatment. Our hypothesis was that patients expressing high levels of PKM2 could
be more resistant to gemcitabine and display worse clinical outcome. The anti-PKM2
antibody was validated by immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses of PANC-1 cells
silenced for PKM2 and with mouse tissues expressing (embryonic) or not (adult) PKM2
(Supplementary Figure 3A-C). Titration analysis established 1: 1600 as the optimal dilution
for immunohistochemistry (Supplementary Figure 3D). The neoplastic lesions of all 42
samples (100%) showed cytoplasmic PKM2 staining (Figure 3D), whereas non-neoplastic
pancreatic tissue occasionally displayed very weak PKM2 staining in normal ductal and
acinar cells (Supplementary Figure 3D). A linear score of staining (range 0-5) was assigned
to each sample (see Materials and Methods) and patients were subdivided in two groups: the
“low PKM2” group comprised 16 samples characterized by weak PKM2 staining (i.e. ≤3)
(Figure 3D, upper panels), whereas the “high PKM2” group comprised 26 samples
displaying stronger PKM2 staining (i.e. >3) (Figure 3D, lower panels). No differences
regarding age, sex and pathological features (mean tumour size, grade, stage and resection
margins) were found between the two groups (Supplementary Table 1). However, the
recurrence free survival (RFS), defined as the time elapsing from surgery to disease
recurrence, was significantly shorter in patients with “high PKM2” (mean 11.6 months) as
compared with the “low PKM2” group (mean 19.8 months; p=0.04; Supplementary Table
1). Accordingly, RFS estimated by Kaplan-Meier curve was significantly shorter in the first
group (Figure 3E), and PKM2 was the only risk factor significantly associated with shorter
RFS at a Cox proportional-hazards regression (HR 1.12; 95% CI 1-4.4; p=0.04). These data
suggest that tumors with higher PKM2 basal expression display more aggressive behavior
and worse response to chemotherapy.

Modulation of PKM splicing impairs drug resistance of DR-PDAC cells

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

AS can be modulated in live cells by antisense short oligonucleotides (ASOs) directed
against a specific regulatory region (40). In the case of PKM, an ASO targeting exon 10
could efficiently induce splicing of PKM1 at the expense of PKM2 (38). We used this tool to
modulate PKM splicing in PDAC cells and to evaluate the contribution of PKM2 to the DR
phenotype. RT-PCR and western blot analyses indicated that AS of endogenous PKM could
be efficiently modulated by transfection of the ASO in PDAC cells (Figure 4A,B). Analysis
of cell death by immunofluorescence for the cleaved/activated form of caspase-3 (Figure
4C), showed that ASO-mediated switching of PKM AS in favour of PKM1 increased the
sensitivity of DR-PDAC cells to gemcitabine without affecting the basal level of cell death
(Figure 4C). Furthermore, overexpression of PKM2 in PCL-PDAC cells protected them
from gemcitabine-induced cell death (Supplementary Figure 4A,B). These results indicate
that PKM2 expression in DR-PDAC cells is required to maintain gemcitabine resistance.
PTBP1 is up-regulated in DR-PDAC cells

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Three hnRNPs (hnRNPI/PTBP1, hnRNPA2/B1 and hnRNPA1) were shown to cooperate to
suppress exon 9 inclusions in the PKM transcript, leading to exon 10 inclusion and
expression of the PKM2 variant (35). Notably, these splicing factors were up-regulated in
brain tumors and their expression strongly correlated with that of PKM2 (35). Thus, we
investigated if the expression of these hnRNPs was altered in DR-PDAC cells with respect to
PCL cells. We found that only PTBP1 was markedly up-regulated in both DR-Pt45P1 and
DR-PANC-1 cells (Figure 5A,B). The highly homologous PTBP2 protein was not detected
in PDAC cells (Figure 5A,B). By contrast, hnRNPA2/B1 levels were unchanged in PCL- and
DR-PDAC cells, whereas hnRNPA1 was up-regulated in DR-PANC-1 (Figure 5B) but
slightly reduced in DR-Pt45P1 (Figure 5A). Furthermore, PTBP1 expression correlated with
sensitivity of PDAC cells to gemcitabine, as it was higher in PANC-1 cells than in Pt45P1
cells (Supplementary Figure 5A). The correlation between PTBP1 expression and PKM2
splicing in both DR-PDAC cell lines was specific, as demonstrated by western blot analysis
of other cancer-related SR proteins and hnRNPs in PCL- and DR-PDAC cells, which
showed either marginal or inconstant alterations. For instance, up-regulation of SRSF1 was
detected in DR-Pt45P1 cells but not in DR-PANC-1 cells (Supplementary Figure 5B),
possibly because PANC-1 cells are more resistant to drug treatment and express higher basal
levels of SRSF1. By contrast, SRSF6 was strongly up-regulated in DR-PANC-1 but slightly
reduced in DR-Pt45P1 (Supplementary Figure 5B). Thus, up-regulation of PTBP1 appears
to specifically correlate with regulation of PKM2 splicing in DR-PDAC cells.
PTBP1 binds in vivo PKM intron 8 and its downregulation impairs PKM2 expression and
sensitizes DR-PDAC cells to drug-induced cell death
To test whether PTBP1 was recruited to the PKM transcript more efficiently in DR-PDAC
cells, we analyzed in vivo binding by CLIP assays in PCL- and DR -Pt45P1 cells, silenced
or not for PTBP1 (Figure 6A). Binding of PTBP1 in intron 8 of PKM favours skipping of
exon 9 in the mature transcript (35), thereby generating the PKM2 isoform. Thus, we
analyzed two regions in intron 8, named A and B (Figure 6A), which were identified as high
PTBP1-bound sequences by CLIP-seq analysis (41). CLIP assays showed that PTBP1 was

recruited more efficiently to PKM intron 8 in DR-Pt45P1 cells with respect to PCL-Pt45P1
cells (Figure 6A). Increased binding was specific and likely dependent on the higher
expression of PTBP1 in DR cells, as it was suppressed by knockdown of the protein to levels
comparable with those expressed in PCL cells (Figure 6A). Thus, up-regulation of PTBP1 in
DR-PDAC cells leads to increased recruitment of this splicing factor to PKM intron 8.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To evaluate the contribution of PTBP1 to the regulation of the PKM2 variant, we analyzed
PKM AS in DR-PDAC cells knocked down for PTBP1. Knockdown of endogenous PTBP1
increased PKM1 splicing in DR-PDAC cells, resulting in a switch in PKM1 and PKM2
protein levels (Figure 6B). These results confirm that up-regulation of PTBP1 promotes
PKM2 splicing in DR-PDAC cells. To test whether PTBP1 affected additional splicing
events in DR-PDAC cells, we analyzed a subset of genes whose AS is regulated by this
splicing factor in other cell types (41,42,43). RT-PCR analysis indicated that only the
FGFR2 IIIc variant correlated with the higher expression of PTBP1 in both DR-PDAC cell
lines (Supplementary Figure 6A). However, silencing of PTBP1 did not affect this splicing
event (Supplementary Figure 6E), indicating that expression of FGFR2 IIIc correlates with
but is not dependent on high PTBP1 expression in DR-PDAC cells. By contrast, splicing of
EZH2, CTTN, RASSF8, MINK1, EIF4G2, FAM38A, CCDC138 and TPM1 was either
similar in PCL- and DR-PDAC cells or altered in one of the two DR cell lines
(Supplementary Figure 6A-C). These findings indicate that splicing of PKM is specifically
modulated by PTBP1 over-expression in DR-PDAC cells.

To investigate whether PTBP1 expression is required for the resistance of DR-PDAC to
chemotherapeutic treatments, we analyzed gemcitabine-induced cell death in PTBP1depleted DR-PDAC cells. Down-regulation of PTBP1 expression significantly rescued the
sensitivity of DR-PDAC cells to treatment with gemcitabine, reaching levels of cell death
similar to those of PCL-PDAC cells (Figure 6C,D). We also tested resistance to cisplatin as
prototype of a class of drugs currently used in clinical trials of combined chemotherapy for
advanced PDAC (44). Cell death analysis showed that DR-PDAC cells were more resistant
to cisplatin treatment than PCL-PDAC cells (Supplementary Figure 7A). However,
switching PKM splicing by either ASO transfection (Supplementary Figure 7B) or
knockdown of PTBP1 (Supplementary Figure 6C) rescued sensitivity to cisplatin, suggesting
that the PTBP1/PKM2 axis is involved in PDAC cell survival to multiple cytotoxic drugs.
Collectively, these results indicate that high PTBP1 expression levels are required for
maintenance of the DR phenotype of PDAC cells and suggest that this splicing factor mainly
confers drug resistance to PDAC cells through the promotion of PKM2 splicing.

Discussion
PDAC is a human cancer characterized by very poor prognosis. Chemotherapeutic
approaches are largely ineffective and treatment with the elective agent gemcitabine slightly
improves survival in patients with advanced disease, but does not represent a cure (1). For
this reason, understanding the biology of PDAC cells might shed light on novel therapeutic
strategies for the management of advanced PDAC. In this work, we show that chronic
gemcitabine treatment leads to isolation of DR-PDAC cells that display higher resistance not

only to gemcitabine, but also to cisplatin, a prototype of cytotoxic drugs largely used in
human cancer therapy, including PDAC (44). These findings suggest that hostile stimuli
promote the adaptive capabilities of PDAC cells, thus favouring the selection of drugresistant populations.

In order to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the acquisition of the DR
phenotype by PDAC cells, we focused on AS regulation because this process is emerging as
a key determinant of eukaryotic cell plasticity (45) that is often altered in human cancers
(5-8). Furthermore, genotoxic stresses, like those imposed by chemotherapeutic treatments,
can finely tune the expression of splice variants that protect cancer cells (15). In this regard,
our study identifies PKM splicing as a novel contributor to drug resistance acquired by
PDAC cells during chronic chemotherapeutic treatment. We found that promotion of PKM2
is the AS event that correlates more closely with drug resistance among a subset of cancerrelevant splicing events analyzed. Importantly, PKM2 splicing and expression are
functionally relevant for the resistance to chemotherapeutic treatment, as switching splicing
toward PKM1 by ASO transfection restored sensitivity of DR-PDAC cells to both
gemcitabine and cisplatin. These results point to PKM2 as a new potential prognostic marker
and therapeutic target for PDAC. In support of this hypothesis, we also found that high
PKM2 expression was the only risk factor significantly associated with shorter RFS in
patients receiving radical surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine. These
results suggest that increased PKM2 expression might be responsible for lower response of
residual cancer cells to chemotherapy. Although we did not find a significant correlation
between PKM2 expression and overall survival, the observed trend suggests that patients
expressing higher PKM2 levels also have a shorter survival rate (Supplementary Table 1).
Studies with a larger cohort of patients will be required to further assess whether or not
PKM2 can be used as marker for prediction of severity of the disease and response to
treatments.
The role of PKM2 in cancer is not fully elucidated yet. Nevertheless, several observations
pointed out that this splice variant is expressed at higher levels in cancer tissues versus their
normal counterparts (22,35). PKM2 protein was proposed as a potential molecular marker of
PDAC, as immune reactivity toward this isoform was elevated in blood from patients and
positively correlated with metastatic disease (46). We now show that PKM2 is barely
detectable in areas of pancreas with normal glands, whereas its expression is increased in
neoplastic lesions. Moreover, our findings document that up-regulation of PKM2 in DRPDAC cells is required for survival in the presence of gemcitabine or cisplatin. Notably,
depletion of PKM2 in several human cancer cell lines caused apoptosis even in the absence
of chemotherapeutic treatments (38,39). This effect was cancer-specific, as depletion of
PKM2 in non-cancerous cells did not affect their viability (39). In the case of DR-PDAC
cells, however, depletion of endogenous PKM2 per se does not trigger cell death, indicating
that PDAC cells are somewhat less dependent on this enzyme for viability. Nevertheless,
PKM2 was strictly necessary to withstand genotoxic stress in DR-PDAC cells. Importantly,
PKM2 expression has been linked to response to chemotherapy also in lung cancer, as its
depletion sensitized to apoptosis triggered by chemotherapeutic treatment in mouse
xenograft models (47). Our work also supports this scenario and suggests that modulation of
PKM splicing by ASO treatment is a potential therapeutic tool to increase the efficacy of

standard chemotherapy in advanced PDAC. This strategy might represent a promising
approach, as ASOs are already in clinical trials for other splicing-caused diseases and
improvement of their design and administration protocols might insure their use in cancer
therapy in the near future (40).

Aberrant expression of several splicing factors correlates with cancer onset, progression
and/or response to therapeutic treatments (48). Our findings indicate that the switch in PKM
AS correlates with the up-regulation of PTBP1 in DR-PDAC cells. A role for PTBP1 in
PKM splicing was already shown in glioblastoma, where this splicing factor acted in concert
with hnRNP A1 and A2/B1 to promote PKM2 splicing (35). However, we found that neither
of these hnRNPs was consistently modulated in DR-PDAC cells. Moreover, knockdown of
PTBP1 to mimic the levels observed in PCL-PDAC cells was sufficient to raise PKM1 levels
to those present in parental cells. Thus, PTBP1 is the main player in the regulation of PKM
AS during the acquisition of the DR phenotype by PDAC cells. Importantly, the effect of
PTBP1 on PKM2 splicing in PDAC cells appears to be direct, as it correlates with the extent
of PTBP1 recruitment to PKM intron 8. Furthermore, its effect on PKM AS can account for
the acquired resistance to genotoxic drugs, as DR-PDAC cells knocked down for PTBP1
switched AS in favour of PKM1 and became sensitive to gemcitabine and cisplatin like
PCL-PDAC cells. Although the pro-survival effect of PTBP1 up-regulation in PDAC cells
might also involve other targets of this splicing factor, our observations suggest that splicing
of PKM2 represents the main player. Indeed, by monitoring a group of splice variants
previously shown to be target of PTBP1 in other cellular systems (41,42,43), we did not
observe striking and consistent changes correlating with the DR-PDAC phenotype. The only
relevant change observed was promotion of the FGFR2 IIIc variant, which, however, was
unaffected by knockdown of PTBP1 in DR-PDAC cells. Furthermore, selectively restoring
the PCL pattern of PKM splicing by ASO transfection almost completely rescued the
sensitivity of DR-PDAC cells to genotoxic stresses. Thus, our results suggest that PKM AS
is particularly sensitive to changes in the expression levels of PTBP1 in PDAC cells and that
this splicing event represent a key resource for these cells to acquire drug resistance.
In conclusion, our work characterizes a novel PTBP1/PKM2 pro-survival pathway triggered
by chronic treatment of PDAC cells with gemcitabine. Interfering with this axis by
repressing PKM2 splicing or PTPB1 expression can restore sensitivity of DR-PDAC cells to
drug treatment. Since development of therapeutic ASOs is already a clinical approach for
other human diseases (40), these findings might represent a promising strategy to improve
therapeutic approaches for PDAC and to impact the resistance of cancer cells to current
treatments.

Gemcitabine (Eli Lilly & Company, IN, USA) and cisplatin (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA)
were dissolved in water. For ASO transfection, cells were transduced by scraping delivery
according to manufacturer’s instructions (Gene Tools, Oregon, USA) with PKM2 or control
ASO (10 μM for DR-PANC-1 cells, 15 μM for DR-Pt45P1 cells). For RNA interference,

Colony formation assay and cell death analyses
Single cell suspensions were plated in 6-well plates (500 cells/plate for Pt45P1, 750 cells/
plate for PANC-1). After 1 day, cells were treated for 24 hours with gemcitabine. Fresh
medium was replaced every 48h. After 10-12 days, cells were fixed in methanol for 10 min,
stained overnight with 5% Giemsa (Sigma-Aldrich), washed in PBS and dried. Pictures were
taken using a digital camera and colonies were counted. For cell death analyses, cells were
seeded at 70% confluence and treated as described for 72 h. Cells were then washed in PBS
and either trypsinized and incubated with 0.4% Trypan Blue Stain (Sigma-Aldrich) or
processed for caspase 3 immunofluorescence using anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody (1:500;
Sigma-Aldrich) as previously described (31,49). Positive cells were then counted using the

agarose or acrylamide gels. RT-PCR images were collected with Biorad Universal Hood II
using Image Lab software. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis was performed
using LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master and the LightCycler 480 System (Roche,
Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primers used are listed in
Supplementary Table 2.
Protein extracts and western blot analysis
Cells were resuspended in RIPA buffer: 150 mM sodium chloride, 1.0% NP-40, 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM NaVO4,
and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). After 10 min on ice, extracts were
centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 g ,supernatants were collected and used for western blot as
described (49). Primary antibody incubation (1:1000) was carried out with the following
antibodies: PKM1, hnRNPA1, hnRNPA2/B1, hnRNPC1/C2 (Sigma-Aldrich); PKM2 (Cell
Signaling Technology, MA, USA); PTBP1, SRSF1, SRP20, SRp40/p55/p75 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, CA, USA); hnRNPF/H (Abcam, UK). PTBP2 antibody was a generous gift
of Professor Douglas L. Black (UCLA, CA). Images of the western blot were acquired as
TIFF files.

Immunohistochemistry analysis

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed as previously described (31). Briefly, formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples obtained from 42 primary non metastatic PDAC
patients receiving surgery with radical intent were investigated for PKM2 expression, upon
informed consent. All patients received gemcitabine-based adjuvant therapy after surgery.
Clinical and histopathological data, time of tumor recurrence and survival for each patient
were recorded. IHC was performed on 4μm-thick sections. Antigen retrieval was carried out
with EDTA at pH8 (60 min at room temperature). Staining was carried out using anti PKM2
antibody (1:1600, Cell Signaling), visualized by Envision-Flex (Dako, Denmark). Staining
of PKM2 in neoplastic cells was scored based on distribution and intensity. Distribution was
scored as 0 (0%), 1 (1-50%) and 2 (51-100%). Intensity was scored as 0 (no signal), 1
(mild), 2 (intermediate), 3 (strong). Values were summed in a total score from 0 to 5.
Samples were classified as “low PKM2” expression (score ≤3) and as “high PKM2”
expression (score >3). Statistical analysis was performed by MedCalc® 9.6
(www.medcalc.be). Differences for continuous variables were evaluated by t-test and for
categorical variables by Fisher’s test. Analysis of recurrence-free survival (RFS) and of
overall survival was performed by Kaplan-Meier method and analysed by Log-rank test.
Univariate and multivariate analyses for risk factors affecting survival were performed by
Cox-proportional hazards regression model test; a p value <0.05 was considered as
statistically significant (Supplementary Table 1). Images were taken from a Zeiss axioskop 2
plus and elaborate with software Zeiss axiovision.
UV-crosslinked and RNA immunoprecipitation (CLIP) assays

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

For CLIP assays, cell extract were performed as previously described (50,51). Half extract
(1mg) was treated with Proteinase K for 30 min at 37°C and RNA was purified (input). The
remaining half (1 mg) was diluted to 1 ml with lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated by using
anti-PTBP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody or IgGs (negative control), in presence of
protein-G magnetic dynabeads (Life Technologies). 10 μl/ml of RNaseI 1:1000 (Life
Technologies) were added. After immunoprecipitation and washes (50,51), an aliquot (10%)
of the sample was kept as control of immunoprecipitation while the rest was treated with
50μg of Proteinase K and incubated for 1hr at 55°C. RNA was then isolated.
Image acquisition and manipulation
Images in Figure 1B were taken from an inverted microscope (IX70; Olympus) using an
LCA ch 40×/0.60 objective. Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator were used for composing the
panels.
