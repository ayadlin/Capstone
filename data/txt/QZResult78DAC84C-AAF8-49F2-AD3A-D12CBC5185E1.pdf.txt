Abstract
Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate-1
(STEAP-1) is a novel cell surface protein highly expressed in
primary prostate cancer, with restricted expression in normal
tissues. In this report, we show STEAP-1 expression in prostate
metastases to lymph node and bone and in the majority of
human lung and bladder carcinomas. We identify STEAP-1
function in mediating the transfer of small molecules between
adjacent cells in culture, indicating its potential role in tumor
cell intercellular communication. The successful generation of
two monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that bind to cell surface
STEAP-1 epitopes provided the tools to study STEAP-1
susceptibility to naked antibody therapy. Both mAbs inhibited
STEAP-1–induced intercellular communication in a dosedependent manner. Furthermore, both mAbs significantly
inhibited tumor growth in mouse models using patientderived LAPC-9 prostate cancer xenografts and established
UM-UC-3 bladder tumors. These studies validate STEAP-1 as
an attractive target for antibody therapy in multiple solid
tumors and provide a putative mechanism for mAb-induced
tumor growth inhibition. [Cancer Res 2007;67(12):5798–805]

Introduction
The clinical use of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) as cancer
therapeutics has been realized in the last few years with the
approval and the successful commercialization of antibody
products, such as trastuzumab, rituximab, cetuximab, and
bevacizumab (1). These advances stimulate the need for identification of additional cell surface targets suitable for antibody-based
therapy. Among the desirable features of such targets are abundant
and homogeneous target expression in the majority of relevant
patient populations, minimal expression in normal vital tissues,
and target involvement in the disease pathogenesis.
Previously, we reported the identification of six-transmembrane
epithelial antigen of the prostate-1 (STEAP-1), a novel 339–amino
acid cell surface antigen (2). Our studies showed significant and
homogeneous STEAP-1 expression in all early and advanced primary
prostate cancer specimens, including hormone-refractory samples,
with predominant expression in prostate among normal tissues (2).
High levels of STEAP-1 were also detected in multiple epithelial
tumor cell lines, suggesting its potential applicability in other cancer

indications. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated STEAP-1
localization at cell-cell junctions of the secretory epithelium of
prostate and prostate cancer cells. This observation, together with
its six-transmembrane topology, suggested that STEAP-1 may
function as a channel/transporter protein in cell-cell junctions.
The favorable expression profiling of STEAP-1 in normal and
cancer tissues suggested its potential use as a target for immunotherapy. Recent studies have shown STEAP-1 as a suitable antigen
for T-cell–based immunotherapy (3–5); however, its utilization for
antibody-mediated targeting has not yet been explored.
In this report, we have extended STEAP-1 expression analysis to
show its significant expression in all prostate cancer metastases
and in the majority of lung and bladder carcinoma specimens
tested. We identified the involvement of STEAP-1 in intracellular
communication in vitro. Two mAbs, specific to STEAP-1 extracellular loops, were shown to inhibit STEAP-1–mediated intercellular
transport in vitro. Furthermore, both antibodies exhibited significant efficacy in inhibiting the in vivo growth of prostate and
bladder tumor xenografts.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and xenografts. All human cancer cell lines used in this study
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cell lines were
maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The
androgen-dependent patient-derived prostate cancer xenograft LAPC-9AD
(6) was obtained from Dr. C. Sawyers (Memorial Sloan-Kettering, New York,
NY). The tumors were propagated by passage in severe combined
immunodeficient (SCID) mice.
Cell line generation. NIH-3T3 and PC3 cells, obtained from American
Type Culture Collection, were transduced with a retroviral vector encoding
STEAP-1 (2, 7). Cells were selected using G418, expanded, and used in the
binding assays. 293T cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1/
MycHis vector (Invitrogen) encoding STEAP-1 using a calcium phosphate
precipitation method. Cells collected after 48 h were confirmed for STEAP-1
expression by flow cytometry.
Immunohistochemical staining. Sheep polyclonal antibody directed to
the NH2 terminus of STEAP-1 was used for immunohistochemical analysis
(2). Briefly, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were cut into 4-Am
sections. Antigen retrieval was carried out in citrate buffer (BioGenex)
in an EZ-Retriever microwave (BioGenex). Sections were incubated with
1.5 Ag/mL antibody followed by sequential incubation with biotinylated
rabbit anti-sheep IgG (Vector Laboratories) and streptavidin-conjugated
horseradish peroxidase (HRP; BioGenex). The peroxidase reaction was
subsequently visualized with 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine substrate (BioGenex).
Intercellular communication assay. Intercellular communication was
measured using a fluorescent dye transfer assay adapted from previously
published studies (8, 9). Briefly, acceptor cells were preloaded with the dye
dextran-Texas red (10,000 molecular weight; Invitrogen/Molecular Probes)
overnight at 37jC. Donor cells were preloaded with 5 Ag/mL of the green
dye calcein AM (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 37jC. Donor cells

were layered over acceptor cells at a ratio of 1:3. Cells were incubated at
37jC for 6 to 7 h. Percentage transfer was calculated as the fraction of cells
that accepted the green dye (yellow/orange cells) in the total population of
acceptor cells (yellow/orange and red cells). Transfer was measured by
counting the number of cells in five different fields using fluorescence
microscopy (40).
Small interfering RNA studies. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)
oligonucleotide 5¶-GAAGACGATTATTTGCATA-3¶, obtained from Dharmacon, was selected based on silencing potency and lack of off-target effect on
STEAP-1–nonexpressing cells (3T3 and RAT1). PC3-STEAP-1 and PC3-neo
cells were transfected with the selected siRNA oligonucleotide at a
concentration of 10 nmol/L using LipofectAMINE-2000 (Invitrogen).
Forty-eight hours later, the cells were harvested and either stained for
STEAP-1 expression by flow cytometry or used in the intercellular
communication assay.
mAb generation and purification. BALB/c mice (Taconic) were
immunized with 293T cells transiently transfected with a vector encoding
STEAP-1. Spleen cells from immunized mice were fused to SP2/0-Ag14
myeloma cells using polyethylene glycol. Supernatants from derived
hybridomas were screened for binding STEAP-1–expressing cells by flow
cytometry. mAbs were purified using standard Protein G (GE Healthcare/
Life Sciences) affinity chromatography.
Western blotting. Cells were lysed using radioimmunoprecipitation
assay buffer [150 mmol/L NaCl/50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH7.2)/1% deoxycholate/1% Triton X-100/0.1% SDS/0.5 mmol/L EDTA]. Anti-STEAP-1 mAbs
were preincubated with protein-G beads at 4jC for 2 h, washed and
incubated with the cell lysates at a concentration of 10 Ag/mL, overnight at
4jC. The immunoprecipitates were washed thrice with PBS, eluted in
sample loading buffer, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were
transferred onto nitrocellulose and the blots were stained with 4 Ag/mL of
sheep STEAP-1 polyclonal antibody (2). After washing, the blot was
incubated with antisheep HRP-conjugated antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.) and developed using the enhanced chemiluminescence
kit (GE Healthcare BioSciences Corp.).
Flow cytometry analysis. Adherent cell monolayers were detached by
treatment with 0.5 mmol/L EDTA in PBS, washed, and incubated with antiSTEAP-1 antibodies for 1 h at 4jC. The cells were then washed and stained
with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Affinity measurements. Adherent cell monolayers were detached by
treatment with 0.5 mmol/L EDTA in PBS and incubated with increasing
concentrations of STEAP-1 mAbs overnight at 4jC. The cells were then
washed and stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG
and analyzed by flow cytometry. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was
plotted against the mAb concentration, and the affinity was determined by
nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism software as the concentration
of ligand required to reach half-maximal binding (GraphPad Software).
In vivo studies. Male ICR-SCID mice, 5 to 6 weeks old, were obtained
from Taconic. For tumor formation inhibition studies, mice were injected
s.c. with 2  106 LAPC-9AD cells mixed with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) at a
ratio of 1:1. Treatment was initiated on the same day with 500 Ag/dose of
either control or STEAP-1 mAb by i.p. injection. Mice were treated twice
weekly for 6 weeks. For treatment of established tumors, mice were injected
s.c. with 2  106 UM-UC-3 cells mixed with Matrigel. Treatment was
initiated on day 8 when tumor volume reached f60 mm3. Mice were
treated with 1 mg mAb injected i.p. twice weekly for three doses. Tumor
length (L) and width (W) were measured with a caliper and tumor volume
was estimated using the formula W 2  L / 2. The percentage inhibition rate
was calculated using the formula:

studies, mean tumor volumes among groups were compared using the
parametric ANOVA test, and results of pairwise comparisons of treated
groups versus control were obtained using Dunnett multiple comparison

Results
Expression of STEAP-1 in human lung, bladder, and
prostate metastasis tumors. Previously, we showed strong and
uniform expression of STEAP-1 protein in all primary prostate
cancer specimens tested and in numerous cell lines derived from
multiple solid tumors (Fig. 1A; ref. 2). In this study, we have
extended the immunohistochemical analysis of STEAP-1 protein
expression to metastatic prostate cancer and to bladder and lung

cancers. All prostate lymph node and bone metastases analyzed
( five specimens each) exhibited strong and homogeneous STEAP-1
staining (Fig. 1B). All 14 primary bladder transitional cancer
specimens were positive for STEAP-1 with 60% showing strong
staining in the majority of the tumor cells (Fig. 1C). STEAP-1
protein expression was also detected in 14 of 16 lung carcinoma
tested including lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (Fig. 1D). Of the positive tumors, 70% expressed STEAP-1 in
the majority of the tumor sections. These results validate STEAP-1
as a potential target not only for all stages of prostate cancer
disease, but also other epithelial tumors.
STEAP-1 mediates intercellular communication activity. We
have observed previously that STEAP-1 protein localizes to areas of
cell-cell junctions. This observation, together with the predicted
secondary structure as a channel protein, suggested that STEAP-1
may be involved in intercellular communication (2). STEAP-1

function as a transporter of small molecules (<1 kDa) between cells
was studied using a fluorescent dye transfer assay (see Materials and
Methods). The prostate cancer cell line PC3, which does not express
STEAP-1, was chosen for the assay due to its minimal intrinsic cell
communication properties resulting from low levels of connexin
expression (10). Retroviral transduction of STEAP-1 or empty vector
was used to generate paired cell lines, PC3-STEAP-1 and control
PC3-neo, to study the effect of STEAP-1 on intercellular communication (Fig. 2A). Donor cells loaded with calcein AM and acceptor
cells loaded with dextran-Texas red were mixed. Dye transfer,
as manifested by intracellular yellow/orange fluorescence, was not
detected between donor and acceptor cells that did not express
STEAP-1 nor between cells in which only one partner expressed
STEAP-1. In contrast, extensive dye transfer was observed in
almost all cells in cultures where both donor and acceptor cells
expressed STEAP-1. Confirmation of STEAP-1 function in mediating

were transfected with a control siRNA
(gray histogram ) or a STEAP-1 siRNA
(black histogram ). Cells were harvested
72 h later, stained with either isotype
control mAb (solid histogram ) or mAb
120.545 (open histograms ), and then
analyzed by FACS.

intercellular communication was done by silencing its expression in
PC3-STEAP-1 acceptor cells using a STEAP-1 siRNA oligonucleotide. Cells transfected with a STEAP-1 siRNA oligonucleotide
showed significant specific decrease in STEAP-1 cell surface
expression (Fig. 2B) and exhibited an 87% reduction in dye transfer
compared with cells transfected with control siRNA (Table 1).
Generation of mAbs specific to STEAP-1 cell surface
epitopes. To evaluate STEAP-1 as a target for antibody therapy,
we generated mAbs that recognize cell surface STEAP-1 epitopes.
Two mouse IgG2an mAbs, 92.30 and 120.545, were derived from
cell-based immunizations. Both mAbs bind specifically to STEAP-1
expressed recombinantly by 3T3 cells and endogenously by the
prostate cancer cell line LNCaP (Fig. 3), the bladder cell line UMUC-3, and the prostate cancer xenograft LAPC-9AD (data not
shown). In all cell lines, mAb 120.545 exhibited stronger binding to
cell surface STEAP-1 as depicted by the higher MFI detected by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) compared with 92.30
mAb. Both mAbs immunoprecipitated the 32-kDa STEAP-1 protein
from 3T3-STEAP-1 cells (Fig. 3B). The mAb affinity to cell surface
STEAP-1 was measured by FACS titration on 3T3-STEAP-1 and
LNCaP cells. mAb 120.545 exhibited an affinity of 1 nmol/L to both
3T3-STEAP-1 and LNCaP cells. mAb 92.30 exhibited lower affinity,
12 and 45 nmol/L for 3T3-STEAP-1 and LNCaP, respectively. We
have found that the two mAbs bind to different STEAP-1 epitopes,
based on their inability to compete with each other in competitive
binding analysis and the robust binding of mAb 92.30 but not
120.545 to the STEAP-1 mouse orthologue (data not shown).
STEAP-1 mAbs block intercellular communication. We
investigated the effect of the two mAbs on STEAP-1–mediated
intercellular communication activity. Incubation of STEAP-1–
expressing donor and acceptor cell populations with each of the
STEAP-1 mAbs blocked intercellular communication in a dosedependent manner (Table 1). Dye transfer was inhibited by 69% and

www.aacrjournals.org

99% in the presence of 50 Ag/mL 92.30 or 120.545 mAb, respectively,
whereas the control mAb did not show a significant effect. These
data show that the STEAP-1 mAbs are capable of modulating the
function of STEAP-1 as an intercellular transporter protein.
STEAP-1 mAbs inhibit tumor growth in vivo. The ability of
STEAP-1 mAbs to inhibit tumor growth in vivo was evaluated using
the patient-derived androgen-dependent prostate cancer xenograft
LAPC-9AD and the bladder cancer cell line UM-UC-3. Both
xenograft models express significant levels of STEAP-1 as
confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of tumor tissues
(Figs. 4A and 5A). SCID mice were injected s.c. with 2  106 LAPC9AD tumor cells and treated i.p. with either PBS, control mouse
mAb, or STEAP-1 mAbs at 500 Ag/dose. Treatment was given twice
weekly for 6 weeks starting on the day of tumor cell injection. As
shown in Fig. 4B, significant inhibition of tumor growth (85% for
mAb 120.545 and 92% for mAb 92.30) was detected on day 40. For
both mAbs, the inhibition rate was statistically significant
compared with control animals (P < 0.05). Mice receiving the
STEAP-1 mAbs were monitored for an additional 7 days after
sacrificing the control-treated mice due to high tumor burden. No
significant increase in tumor volume was observed 7 days after the
last treatment. Previous studies have shown that in LAPC-9AD
tumor-bearing mice, PSA blood levels were directly correlated to
tumor burden (6, 11). To further confirm STEAP-1 mAb efficacy,
sera obtained from mice at time of sacrifice were tested for PSA
levels. As shown in Fig. 4C, significant reduction (>95%) in
circulating PSA levels was detected in mice treated with either
120.545 or 92.30 mAb compared with control mice.
The antitumor effect of STEAP-1 mAbs was also evaluated in
established bladder cancer UM-UC-3 xenografts (Fig. 5B). UM-UC-3
cells were injected s.c. into SCID mice to establish tumors. STEAP-1
mAb treatment was initiated on day 8 when tumors reached a
volume of 50 to 60 mm3. Randomized mouse groups were treated

doses. The study was terminated on day 20 due to high tumor
burden in the control group. Statistically significant inhibition of
tumor growth was detected following treatment with mAb 92.30
(inhibition of 51%; P = 0.0015) and mAb 120.545 (inhibition of 47%;
P = 0.0055) compared with the control group. These in vivo studies
show potent STEAP-1 mAb efficacy in inhibiting growth of both
prostate and bladder tumor xenografts. Treatment of mice with
mAb 92.30, which binds to the murine STEAP-1 orthologue, did not
show any overt toxicity. The mice were well groomed and sustained
normal body weight and their movement was normal during the
experimental period.

Discussion
This report provides validation of STEAP-1 as an attractive target
for antibody cancer therapy based on its significant expression in

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (12). June 15, 2007

multiple cancer indications and its apparent involvement in tumor
growth that can be modulated by naked mAbs. Our overall
immunohistochemical analysis of patient samples shows significant
STEAP-1 expression in various epithelial tumors. The strong and
homogeneous STEAP-1 expression, shown previously in primary
prostate cancer, has been extended in this study to prostate cancer
metastases to lymph node and bone. STEAP-1 expression was also
detected in the majority of tested specimens of lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas as well as bladder
transitional carcinomas, thus expanding the repertoire of cancer
indications applicable to STEAP-1–targeted therapy.
We describe the successful generation of two unique mAbs
specific to the extracelluar epitopes of STEAP-1 and their
utilization to show antitumor efficacy. Generation of mAbs to
STEAP-1 cell surface epitopes was a challenging task due to the
predicted exposure of only small peptide loops on the extracellular
leaflet. The two mAbs exhibit different affinities and bind to

different epitopes; however, both inhibited STEAP-1–mediated
intercellular communication and the growth of two different
xenograft tumor models. The antibodies inhibited the formation of
patient-derived LAPC-9 prostate cancer xenografts, as manifested
by both tumor volume and PSA levels. Furthermore, they inhibited
the growth of established UM-UC-3 bladder cancer xenografts.
These results support the involvement of STEAP-1 in growth of
these two xenograft models and indicate the ability of STEAP-1
antibodies to modulate this function. STEAP-1 mAbs 92.30 and
120.545 were evaluated in proliferation assays in vitro in both
LNCaP and UMUC-3 cell lines. The mAbs did not affect the
proliferation of the cell lines (data not shown). Because a
significant effect of both mAbs on tumor growth in vivo was
observed in two different models, we propose that STEAP-1 may
play a critical role in tumor growth in vivo but not in vitro due to
interaction with neighboring cells within the solid tumor
microenvironment.
Of interest is the identification of STEAP-1 function as an
intercellular communication protein, which concurs with our
previous hypothesis based on its localization to cell-cell boundaries
and its projected topology (2). Using a dye transfer assay, we show
that STEAP-1 expression in connexin-deficient PC3 cells induces
significant dye transport between cells, which is inhibited by
specific STEAP-1 siRNA.
The predicted secondary structure of STEAP-1 as a channel
protein supports the possibility that STEAP-1 acts as a transporter
protein to directly transfer the dye between the cells. Alternatively,
STEAP-1 may affect intercellular communication indirectly, by
altering intracellular ion concentrations, which in turn regulate gap
or adherence junction activity. Such a function was attributed to
L-type calcium channels, which were shown to regulate adhesion

gap junction activity in human osteoblastic cells via regulation of
calcium influx (12). Recently, the family member STEAP-3 (TSAP6)
has been shown to promote exosome secretion, which in turn
allowed communication between adjacent cells (13). This may
be an additional potential mechanism mediating the observed
STEAP-1 intercellular communication activity.
The role of cell-cell communication in cancer pathogenesis has
been gaining attention (14). Cellular communication facilitates the
intercellular exchange of small molecular weight solutes, such as
nutrients, metabolites, electrolytes, and second messengers from
distant blood vessels, thus supporting tumor growth. Substantial
evidence from various models implicates cell-cell communication
in the ability of tumor cells to invade and metastasize. Intercellular
communication between glioma tumor cells and astrocytes or
endothelial cells was shown to increase tumor invasion and to
increase vascular endothelial growth factor secretion and vascular
tube formation, respectively (9, 15, 16). In prostate cancer, a direct
correlation between increased connexin 26 expression levels and
cancer progression was observed (17). The ability of STEAP-1 mAbs
to inhibit growth of STEAP-1–expressing tumors and its intercellular transport function suggest a potential link between STEAP-1
transport function and its involvement in tumor cell growth. The
inhibition of STEAP-1–mediated intercellular communication can
further facilitate the effect of the mAbs on tumor growth in an
in vivo microenvironment where limited nutrients and interaction
with surrounding matrix components require various survival
mechanisms.
Structural domains in STEAP-1 may suggest its involvement in
tumor cell growth. STEAP-1 contains a heme-binding domain
called the apoptosis, cancer and redox associated transmembrane
domain, which is present in a structurally related family identified

recently to include members of the STEAP family, as well as the
bacterial NADPH oxidase (Nox) family and the YedZ family of
oxidoreductases (18, 19). The heme-binding domain function
present in this family may facilitate electron transfer and thereby
alter cell growth and metabolism as has been shown for the
bacterial proteins (20). Unlike the other members of the STEAP
family and the bacterial Nox and YedZ families, STEAP-1 has only a
heme-binding domain but not an oxidoreductase domain. The role
of this structural feature of STEAP-1 in its intercellular transport
function remains to be explored.
The characteristics of STEAP-1 described here validate it as a
novel target with the desirable characteristics for antibody therapy.
STEAP-1 is one of a few prostate cancer antigens that meet the
appropriate criteria and represent potential antibody therapy
targets. Other novel antigens include PSCA, a cell surface antigen
highly expressed in all stages of prostate cancer (21). PSCA has
been successfully targeted with naked mAbs in various xenograft
models leading to significant inhibition of tumor growth and
spread (11, 22) and is currently being evaluated in clinical trials. In

addition, toxin-conjugated anti-PSCA antibody completely eradicated established tumors (23). For other novel prostate cancer
targets, such as PSMA and tomoregulin, naked mAb efficacy has
not been shown, resulting in the need to use mAbs as a vehicle to
deliver payloads, such as radioisotopes and toxins, to affect tumor
growth (24–26). The strong and homogeneous expression of
STEAP-1 in cancer specimens, together with its restricted
expression in normal tissues, also makes it a suitable target for
antibody drug conjugate therapy. Taken together, STEAP-1 is an
appealing target for antibody therapy that warrants future clinical
investigation for multiple solid tumor indications.
