Nonoperative Management of Rectal Cancer
Jordan A. Torok, MD; Manisha Palta, MD; Christopher G. Willett, MD; and Brian G. Czito, MD

Surgery has long been the primary curative modality for localized rectal cancer. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation has significantly
improved local control rates and, in a significant minority, eradicated all disease. Patients who achieve a pathologic complete
response to neoadjuvant therapy have an excellent prognosis, although the combination treatment is associated with long-term morbidity. Because of this, a nonoperative management (NOM) strategy has been pursued to preserve sphincter function in select
patients. Clinical and radiographic findings are used to identify patients achieving a clinical complete response to chemoradiation,
and they are then followed with intensive surveillance. Incomplete, nonresponding and those demonstrating local progression are
referred for salvage with standard surgery. Habr-Gama and colleagues have published extensively on this treatment strategy and
have laid the groundwork for this approach. This watch-and-wait strategy has evolved over time, and several groups have now
reported their results, including recent prospective experiences. Although initial results appear promising, several significant challenges remain for NOM of rectal cancer. Further study is warranted before routine implementation in the clinic. Cancer 2016;122:34C 2015 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
In 2015, an estimated 40,000 cases of rectal cancer will be diagnosed in the United States.1 Surgical therapy, by either low
anterior resection (LAR) or abdominoperineal resection (APR), has long been considered the primary curative modality
for localized disease. In recent decades, a paradigm shift for locally advanced disease has occurred: postoperative chemoradiation therapy (CRT) has largely been supplanted by a neoadjuvant approach, either through short-course radiation therapy (RT) alone or long-course CRT. This shift has been paralleled by improvements in preoperative imaging and staging,
including endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as advancements in surgical techniques. Although the initial rationale for neoadjuvant treatment was to decrease local recurrence rates, improve treatment
tolerability, and increase sphincter-preserving surgery rates, a small but significant percentage of patients were found to be
complete pathologic responders upon examination of the surgical specimen. Investigators have since explored definitive
CRT and careful follow up, also called nonoperative management (NOM), as a curative approach for select patients, with
surgery reserved as salvage therapy. This review aims to critically evaluate NOM of rectal cancer in the modern era.
BACKGROUND
The preferred surgical approach for rectal cancer depends on the location of the cancer in relation to the anal sphincter
complex: a sphincter-preserving LAR is reserved for proximal and midrectal lesions, and an APR requiring a permanent
stoma is reserved for distal lesions. Both types of resections now preferentially use total mesorectal excision (TME); this
technique removes a circumferential envelope of perirectal tissue in its entirety and has been found to reduce local recurrence rates in comparison with the historical blunt dissection approach.2 Numerous perioperative complications, including vascular injury and/or presacral bleeding,3 infection, wound complications, ureteral injury,4 and both urinary and
sexual dysfunction,5,6 have been associated with this procedure. In the Dutch TME prospective, randomized controlled
trial, which allocated patients to TME alone or a short course of neoadjuvant RT followed by TME, observed in-hospital/
postoperative mortality and overall complication rates were 3% and 47%, respectively.7,8 Complication rates from TME
with or without RT were similar; complications included perioperative bleeding in approximately 13%, anastomotic leaks
in approximately 11% (LAR patients), and operative reintervention in approximately 14%. Higher overall complication
rates were seen in patients treated with APR versus LAR. Neoadjuvant RT was, however, associated with increased blood

loss and increased perineal complications in those undergoing APR.8,9 With longer follow up, patients treated
with neoadjuvant RT were more likely to experience
chronic bowel dysfunction,10,11 urinary incontinence,12
and small bowel obstruction.13,14
Patients in the United States with American Joint
Committee on Cancer stage I lesions (tumor invasion of
the submucosa [T1] or muscularis propria [T2] and no regional lymph node [N0] or distant metastases [M0])15 are
usually treated with surgery alone, whereas most patients
with a T3-T4 stage (the tumor invades through the muscularis propria into pericolorectal tissues [T3], penetrates
to the surface of the visceral peritoneum [T4a], or directly
invades or is adherent to other organs or structures [T4b])
and/or any lymph node metastases are treated with a
combined-modality approach followed by surgical resection. Uniform treatment of these patients exposes them to
a risk of acute perioperative and long-term morbidity as
seen in the Dutch TME trial, particularly with distal
tumors planned for APR.
A nonoperative strategy may avoid the complications associated with TME. This is of particular concern
for elderly patients and for those with significant medical
comorbidities. Another potential concern is the perceived
reduction in quality of life with a permanent stoma. Compared with patients undergoing LAR, APR patients have
an inferior perceived body image as well as impaired sexual and urinary function.16,17 In contrast, LAR patients
may experience worse gastrointestinal tract symptoms in
comparison with APR patients, with similar overall
quality-of-life scores. These factors have influenced the rationale for NOM.
The potential clinical effectiveness of NOM is highlighted by pathologic response rates from neoadjuvant trials, particularly those using long-course CRT for locally
advanced cancers. Pathologic complete response (pCR)
rates in these trials range from 8% to 20%.18-24 Subsequent recurrence in patients achieving a pCR is uncommon,20,25 with several large meta-analyses reporting
significantly lower cumulative rates of local recurrence
ranging from 0.7% to 0.8% as well as improved overall
survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in comparison to partial responders or nonresponders.26-28 Although
the majority of these studies have used TME, evidence
also suggests a similarly favorable prognosis for those who
undergo local excision.29 Most of these studies use longcourse CRT regimens in which surgery is delayed by 6 to
8 weeks after treatment completion. Retrospective evidence suggests a higher incidence of pCR with longer
intervals between CRT and surgery.30-32 One prospective
Cancer

trial found that delaying surgery to 11 weeks after CRT
with integration of intensified chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6) during the rest period increased the pCR rate to
25% versus 18% with the usual 6-week period.33 A recent
update of this study reported on 2 additional study groups
with surgery delayed by 15 and 19 weeks (4 vs 6 intervening cycles of mFOLFOX6); this resulted in pCR rates of
30% and 38%, respectively.34 In standard short-course
RT, surgery is typically performed 1 week later, with pCR
rarely observed (1%) with this interval.35,36 Prolonging
the interval from preoperative RT to surgery by 2 versus 6
to 8 weeks, as in the Lyon 90-01 trial, improved the pCR
rate from 7% to 14%.37 Delayed surgery did not appear
to compromise clinical outcomes in several studies.38,39
Theoretically, if no viable tumor remains, then surgery may not add clinical benefit while potentially increasing morbidity. By definition, NOM precludes pathologic
confirmation of the primary tumor and lymph node
response. As a result, a clinical complete response (cCR) is
used as a surrogate for pCR. The determination of a cCR
is defined variably, but it is typically assessed with a combination of digital rectal examination (DRE), direct visualization by proctoscopy, and imaging studies with or
without biopsy confirmation. Imaging modalities have
been investigated to assess pCR. Fluorodeoxyglucose–
positron emission tomography and computed tomography (CT) appear limited in their ability to distinguish
pCR from partial responses.40
EUS and MRI are important techniques in the preoperative staging of rectal cancer. In one meta-analysis,
EUS was found to have increased sensitivity for perirectal
tissue invasion in comparison with MRI (90% vs 82%),
although the 2 modalities had similar rates of sensitivity
and specificity for nodal involvement (66%-67% and
76%-78%, respectively).41 The sensitivity of EUS is highest for advanced disease and decreases to approximately
80% for T2 disease.42 In contrast to a pretreatment evaluation, a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies
investigating standard MRI and EUS for restaging after
neoadjuvant treatment found that these techniques overstaged 73% and 66% of patients with ypT0 disease,
respectively.43 Both techniques had poor sensitivity for
ypT0 disease (MRI, 15%; EUS, 37%) but high specificity
(95% for both). Multiparametric MRI appears to have
increased utility in predicting pCR.44-46 Although visual
and digital palpation can supplement the evaluation of
the primary tumor, the response of clinically involved
lymph node metastases relies solely on imaging. The
nodal restaging accuracy for both standard MRI and EUS
has been reported to be approximately 72%.43 Several
35

Review Article

studies have shown that nodal responses tend to mirror
the response of the primary tumor, with ypN 1 rates
 5% in patients with ypT0 disease.47 Lymph node size,
morphology, or both, typically based on MRI, appear to
correlate with residual metastases.48 The reported accuracy of MRI in assessing complete response in initially
involved lymph nodes ranges from 80% to 90%,49,50 with
additional techniques such as contrast enhancement
potentially improving these rates.51 Because of the potential predictive value of MRI, it has been incorporated by
some groups into the assessment of cCR.
NOM
Investigators from the Angelita and Joaquim Gama Institute (University of Sao Paulo School of Medicine) have
published their NOM results for patients with potentially
resectable rectal cancer. In one early report, Habr-Gama
et al52 reported the outcomes of 265 patients with distal
cT2-T4 and/or N 1 rectal cancer (0-7 cm from the anal
verge) treated with neoadjuvant CRT (5040 cGy with
infusional 5-fluorouracil). Patients were re-evaluated at
least 8 weeks after the completion of CRT with clinical,
endoscopic, and radiologic studies with biopsies obtained
during proctoscopy for pathologic confirmation of a
response. An incomplete response was defined as a residual ulcer/mass or positive biopsies, and these patients were
subsequently managed with immediate surgery. Initial
clinical complete responders underwent a strict watchand-wait strategy, including monthly physical/digital rectal examinations, proctoscopy, biopsy of any suspicious
areas, and serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) monitoring with abdominal pelvic CT every 6 months for the
first year. Only patients with sustained tumor regression
for at least 12 months were considered to have a cCR.
After CRT, 71 patients (26.8%) of the patients met the
criteria for a cCR. These patients had a mean follow-up of
57 months, during which 2 patients (2.8%), 0 patients,
and 3 patients (4.2%) developed an endoluminal, pelvic,
or systemic recurrence, respectively. Both local failures
were treated successfully with salvage therapy. These
results were updated with a larger patient cohort, and the
feasibility of this approach was further described.53
Importantly, this publication describes the numbers
of both initial and sustained responders, with 20% of the
initial complete responders developing tumor regrowth
within 12 months. When only those patients who
retained a cCR after 12 months were selected, the endorectal recurrence rate was 6% (all were treated with salvage
therapy except for 1 patient with both local and systemic
recurrence), and the 5-year OS and DFS rates were 93%
36

and 85%, respectively. In the most recent report, the outcomes of all patients initially enrolled for the watch-andwait strategy, including those with early tumor regrowth,
were reported.54 An assessment 8 weeks after CRT found
that 49% of the patients had a cCR. With a median
follow-up of 60 months, 31% of the patients with an initial cCR developed a local recurrence. Of these recurrences, 60% occurred within the first 12 months. Salvage
therapy was possible and effective for most local recurrences, with 7% of patients not amenable to salvage.
Sphincter preservation was achieved in 86% of all patients
with this strategy. Systemic recurrence was seen in 14% of
patients, with 5-year cause-specific OS and DFS rates of
91% and 68%, respectively. These results are summarized
in Table 1. It should be noted that these authors offered
full-thickness local excision (FTLE) for small residual
lesions and used radical resection for adverse pathologic
findings or a strict surveillance program for patients with
ypT0 disease.55
Other reports of NOM have included patients who
were medically inoperable or refused surgery. Lim et al56
retrospectively reviewed 48 such patients in a multiinstitutional database in Australia. The median age of
these patients was 76 years, and the majority had distal
tumors (<8 cm from the anal verge) with T3 disease and
were treated with CRT. In contrast to the Habr-Gama
studies, follow-up was not as rigorous, and cCR was
defined solely on the basis of the visual appearance at examination. In addition, salvage was not possible for many
of these patients because of medical comorbidities. A cCR
was reported for 56% of the patients, and after a median
follow-up of 49 months, progression was seen in 37%
(local component in 60%). Patients who achieved a cCR
had significantly longer progression-free survival than
incomplete responders.
Maas et al57 aimed to prospectively replicate the
results from Sao Paulo with modern MRI techniques as
part of a strict selection process. Patients were treated with
a neoadjuvant regimen similar to that of the Habr-Gama
studies, although capecitabine was used as part of the
CRT regimen. According to their strict definition of a
cCR, only 11% of patients were determined to be eligible
for their wait-and-see policy. These patients were compared with a group that achieved a pCR (approximately
half of whom required a permanent colostomy and 35%
of whom had major operative complications). The 2-year
DFS (89% vs 93%) and OS rates (100% vs 91%) were
similar for the cCR and pCR patients. The 1 recurrence in
the wait-and-see approach group was successfully salvaged
with surgery. In addition, long-term bowel dysfunction

was worse in operatively managed patients. The low cCR
rate in this study versus Habr-Gama et al’s study was likely
a result of strict imaging criteria, which classified a cCR in
only 5 of the 20 patients found to have a pCR in the operative group.
Another prospective experience from Denmark evaluated patients with primary, resectable T2 or T3, N0-1
adenocarcinoma of the distal rectum (<6 cm). Patients
were treated with high-dose radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30
fractions with a 5-Gy endorectal brachytherapy boost)
and oral tegafur-uracil. Patients who achieved complete
clinical regression according to endoscopy/biopsy and had
no evidence of regional/distant metastases according to
MRI/CT 6 weeks after treatment were prospectively
observed. This watchful-waiting approach consisted of
clinical examination and endoscopy every 2 months for
year 1, every 3 months for year 2, every 6 months for year
3, and then annually, with biopsy reserved for suspicious
lesions. Positron emission tomography/CT was performed 3 times in the first year, twice in the second year,
and annually thereafter. Out of 51 eligible patients, 40
met the criteria for watchful waiting (78% cCR rate).58
With a median follow-up of 24 months, the 1- and 2-year
cumulative local recurrence rates for these patients were
15% and 26%, respectively. The median time to recurrence was 10.4 months, and all patients with local recurrence were surgically salvaged without additional
recurrence. Approximately 70% of the patients retained
sphincter function without fecal incontinence.
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center investigators have reported further experience with NOM of
rectal cancer. Smith et al60 reviewed the outcomes of 32
patients achieving a cCR, and as in Maas et al’s study,57
they compared the outcomes with those of contemporaneous patients achieving a pCR with resection. The
response assessment after CRT was not standardized
during this period but was primarily based on the absence of a palpable tumor on digital rectal examination
(DRE) or any visual pathology at endoscopy. With a
median follow-up of 28 months, the actuarial local
Cancer

recurrence for NOM was 21% versus 0% in the pCR
group.60 All local failures, however, were successfully
salvaged with surgery, and clinical outcomes were otherwise similar and favorable between the 2 groups. This
experience was recently updated, now with 73 patients
achieving cCR. A cCR in this update was defined on
the basis of DRE, proctoscopy, and imaging criteria as
assessed approximately 8 weeks after CRT. Patients
with a cCR were followed with endoscopy and DRE at
intervals of 3, 4, 6, and 12 months in year 1, year 2,
years 3-5 and beyond 5 years, respectively. Imaging was
performed every 6 months in years 1 and 2, followed by
every 6 to 12 months in years 3 to 5. With a median
follow-up of 3.5 years, local tumor regrowth was seen
in 26%.59 Nearly all patients with regrowth were salvaged with surgery, with preservation of the rectum in
77% of the patients. OS and disease-specific survival
were again similar and favorable between the NOM
and pCR groups. These experiences are summarized in
Table 2.
CRITICAL EVALUATION
The experience with NOM for potentially resectable rectal cancer (primarily the experience of investigators at the
University of Sao Paulo) has evolved with time. The majority of the patients in early studies were not initially
staged or followed with modern imaging techniques,
including MRI and endorectal ultrasound, so the assessment of cCR was based primarily on clinical examination.
In the Habr-Gama studies, the definition of cCR necessitated intensive monthly follow-up beginning 8 weeks after
CRT completion, and a 1-year disease-free interval was
required for classification as a complete clinical responder.
This effectively resulted in a highly selected patient population with favorable tumor biology. Not surprisingly,
these patients had an excellent prognosis. Additionally,
many of the previously discussed series have relatively
short median follow up, and should be considered preliminary given the sometimes long natural history seen in rectal cancer recurrence.

The definition of cCR and how it predicts pCR
requires further clarification. A pCR assessment requires
an operative intervention; therefore, it is problematic to
extrapolate the favorable results of patients with a pCR to
those with a cCR. In a series from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center evaluating patients treated with neoadjuvant CRT followed by a planned resection in 6 weeks,
pCR was seen in only 25% of patients deemed as cCR by
preoperative proctoscopy.61 Although longer post-CRT
intervals may result in higher response rates, delayed surgery may be associated with inferior survival,62 although
this remains controversial. According to the Habr-Gama
and Memorial Sloan Kettering series, most recurrences for
patients with an initial cCR occur within the first 12
months. Although local salvage therapy may be possible
for most of these patients, 30% of those with early
regrowth developed systemic recurrence.54 These patients
likely had an unfavorable biology and/or subclinical residual disease that was not appreciated on re-evaluation.
Whether early surgery would have benefited these patients
is unknown.
The process of selecting operative versus nonoperative strategies based on clinical assessment is also confounded by the fact that patients with residual
abnormalities may have in fact responded well, with 8%
of nonresponders demonstrating a pCR in the HabrGama series52 and 75% demonstrating a pCR in the more
restrictive Maas series.57 The latter series particularly
emphasizes the potential mismatch between clinical and
imaging criteria for a cCR and an actual response. HabrGama and colleagues offer FTLE for patients with small
(<3-cm) residual abnormalities. In one report, 20% of
these patients were found to have ypT0 disease,63 and this
further highlights the inaccuracy of clinical restaging.
FTLE allows confirmation of the pathologic response but
has several drawbacks, including the potential for morbidity63 and higher local failure rates.64
Another important consideration is the toxicity and
quality of life after definitive CRT for rectal cancer.
Although the report from Maas et al57 suggests improved
bowel function with NOM, there is little additional
38

evidence documenting the toxicity and quality of life
following definitive CRT. Although a different treatment
regimen is used, definitive CRT for anal canal carcinoma
is associated with adverse effects on quality of life, including long-term sexual and bowel dysfunction.65 Although
NOM may improve sphincter-preservation rates, a nonfunctioning or poorly functioning sphincter will result in
a significantly detrimental impact on quality of life. The
intensity of follow-up and resources necessary to assess
and monitor a cCR may also have a significant impact on
quality of life and health care costs.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Further study of radiographic and biologic predictors of
cCR/pCR may ultimately facilitate improved selection of
patients eligible for NOM instead of a waiting period for
all patients. Radiographic techniques, particularly MRI,
have already shown promise for defining favorable outcomes after neoadjuvant CRT.66 Additional improvements are necessary to improve the accuracy of cCR
assessment. Biomarkers and gene expression profiles may
also serve as predictive tools. Low pretreatment CEA levels have been associated with an improved pathologic
response.67-69 Low posttreatment CEA levels (<5-6 ng/
mL) may indicate significant pathologic downstaging
when the pretreatment level was elevated.70,71 Certain
genetic expression profiles have also been correlated with
tumor response,72 but reproducing these results in independent cohorts has been challenging.73
Prospective trials are ultimately needed before routine implementation of the NOM approach. Two
randomized, multicenter clinical trials are currently
ongoing that will help to further clarify the role of NOM.
Investigators from Sao Paulo are conducting a prospective
phase 2 trial randomizing patients achieving a cCR 12
weeks after chemoradiotherapy to TME or close observation (NCT02052921). The primary endpoint will be 3year DFS. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
investigators are also conducting a prospective phase 2
trial (NCT02008656), although the study design is more
complex and does not directly address the question of

NOM. Patients will be randomized to 1 of 3 arms: 2 experimental arms investigating the use and timing of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (before or after neoadjuvant CRT
but before surgery) and a standard arm consisting of neoadjuvant CRT, TME, and adjuvant chemotherapy. The
experimental arms include TME or NOM as treatment
approaches. As before, the primary endpoint will be 3year DFS. In the United Kingdom, a single-arm prospective study is underway to determine the safety of NOM after a response to preoperative CRT. Patients will have
MRI performed 4 weeks after long-course CRT, and if no
viable disease or a partial response is seen, MRI will be
repeated at 8 weeks. Patients who remain disease-free or
continue to respond will be eligible for continued observation. Taken together, these trials will further help to identify a select population appropriate for NOM and provide
further clinical information regarding its safety and efficacy. Because of the intensive follow-up of NOM, costeffectiveness research will also be important in the future
evaluations and development of this approach.
CONCLUSIONS
Initial reports of NOM for selected rectal cancer patients
appear promising. The optimal tools for assessing cCR
remain to be determined. Overly stringent criteria may
exclude patients who may have or will respond to treatment, whereas broader criteria will require increased utilization of salvage surgery and the morbidity associated
with resection. The intensive follow-up and extensive surgical and radiologic experience necessary for an NOM
program may limit its widespread use. In addition, robust
prospective experiences and prospective quality-of-life
and toxicity data are currently lacking. At present,
combined-modality therapy including TME should
remain the standard of care for locally advanced rectal
cancer pending further prospective validation of a nonoperative approach.
