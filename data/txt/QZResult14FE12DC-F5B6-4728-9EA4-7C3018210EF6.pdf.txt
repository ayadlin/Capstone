ABSTRACT:
Therapies targeting MAPK and AKT/mTOR signaling are currently being evaluated
in clinical trials for several tumor types. However, recent studies suggest that these
therapies may be limited due to acquired cancer cell resistance and a small therapeutic
index between normal and cancer cells. The identification of novel proteins that are
involved in MAPK or AKT/mTOR signaling and differentially expressed between normal
and cancer cells will provide mechanistically distinct therapeutic targets with the
potential to inhibit these key cancer-associated pathways. We recently identified
FAM83B as a novel, previously uncharacterized oncogene capable of hyperactivating
MAPK and mTOR signaling and driving the tumorigenicity of immortalized human
mammary epithelial cells (HMEC). We show here that elevated FAM83B expression
also activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and confers a decreased sensitivity
to PI3K, AKT, and mTOR inhibitors. FAM83B co-precipitated with the p85α and
p110α subunits of PI3K, as well as AKT, and increased p110α and AKT membrane
localization, consistent with elevated PI3K/AKT signaling. In tumor-derived cells
harboring elevated FAM83B expression, ablation of FAM83B decreased p110α and AKT
membrane localization, suppressed AKT phosphorylation, and diminished proliferation,
AIG, and tumorigenicity in vivo. We propose that the level of FAM83B expression may
be an important factor to consider when combined therapies targeting MAPK and AKT/
mTOR signaling are used. Moreover, the identification of FAM83B as a novel oncogene
and its integral involvement in activating PI3K/AKT and MAPK provides a foundation
for future therapies aimed at targeting FAM83B in order to suppress the growth of
PI3K/AKT- and MAPK-driven cancers.

INTRODUCTION

the recruitment of CRAF to the membrane for activation,
resulting in MEK1 and MEK2 phosphorylation and
subsequently ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation [3]. The
phosphorylated ERK proteins then activate transcription
factors responsible for regulating growth and proliferation.
In addition to hyperactivating CRAF, inappropriate RTK
or RAS activity also results in increased PI3K-p110
activation, either by IRS (Insulin receptor substrate
1)-mediated p110 recruitment to the receptor or direct
binding of a RAS binding domain (RBD) in the p110
catalytic subunit to RAS itself [4].

The acquisition of persistent growth signaling
is a hallmark of cellular transformation that can be
conferred by an ever increasing number of mechanisms
[1;2]. Often, the aberrant activation of receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTK) or downstream effectors such as RAS,
MAPK, and PI3K/AKT signaling drive proliferation
independently of whether growth factors are present. For
example, constitutive RAS activation, conferred either
by mutation or upstream RTK hyperactivity, enhances

In numerous breast cancer subtypes, elevated
RTK and PI3K signaling is an important driver of
transformation [5]. As with MAPK signaling, activation
of p110 by mutation or stimulation by RTKs results in a
phosphorylation cascade that includes phosphoinositidedependent protein kinase (PDK-1), AKT, and mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR regulates numerous
cell division and growth pathways by modulating
transcription, translation and protein degradation [6]. In
addition to directly phosphorylating mTOR, AKT also
phosphorylates TSC2, which results in a Rheb-mediated
interaction between mTOR and Raptor (regulatory
associated protein of mTOR) to create mTOR complex
1 (mTORC1). mTORC1 phosphorylates dowstream
effectors S6K and 4E-BP1, resulting in increased
translation by eIF-4E [7]. Collectively, these processes
all promote cell growth and survival in response to RASPI3K-AKT activation. Numerous targeted therapies aimed
at inhibiting RTKs (HER2, EGFR, MET, KIT, and VEGF)
or the downstream effectors described here (RAS, RAF,
MEK, PI3K, AKT and mTOR) have been developed and
are currently being evaluated in a number of clinical trials
[7-9]. However, the complexity of RTK and downstream
signaling interactions continues to limit the effectiveness
of targeted therapies, since cells can simply reprogram
growth and survival signals [10;11]. For these reasons, the
identification of novel targets for therapeutic intervention
need to be pursued [12].
Recently, we identified FAM83B (Family with
Sequence Similarity 83, member B) in a forward genetic
screen for genes that drive human mammary epithelial cell
(HMEC) transformation [13]. Further, we demonstrated
that FAM83B is required for EGFR/RAS-mediated

transformation and is a critical component necessary for
transmitting signals from activated RAS to downstream
MAPK effectors. Mechanistically, the elevated MAPK
activation observed in FAM83B-expressing HMEC was
due to an increased interaction between FAM83B and
CRAF, which dislodged inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins from
binding to CRAF and increased CRAF localization at
the membrane. Conversely, we found that inhibition of
FAM83B from breast cancer cell lines increased CRAF
interactions with negative regulatory 14-3-3 proteins,
decreased CRAF membrane localization, decreased MEK
activity, and decreased tumorigenicity. We show here
that elevated FAM83B expression increases PI3K/AKT
signaling, which cooperates to transform HMEC and
decreases the sensitivity to of HMEC to PI3K, AKT, and
mTOR inhibitors. Conversely, ablation of FAM83B from
EGFR-dependent breast cancer cells inhibits p110α and
AKT membrane localization and AKT phosphorylation.
Importantly, the suppression of both the PI3K/AKT and
MAPK signaling following FAM83B ablation results in a
significant reduction in tumorigenicity, providing critical
insight into the potential efficacy of future therapies aimed
at targeting FAM83B.

RESULTS
FAM83B utilizes multiple RAS effectors to drive
HMEC transformation.
We recently identified FAM83B in a ValidationBased Insertional Mutagenesis (VBIM) screen based on

CRAF, and MEK1 in HME1 cells.

its ability to promote the anchorage-independent growth
(AIG) and tumorigenicity of immortalized HMEC in a
manner similar to RAS-G12V [13]. Subsequent analysis
defined FAM83B as a critical intermediary in CRAF/
MAPK signaling. To determine whether FAM83Bmediated CRAF activation is sufficient to drive HMEC
transformation or whether FAM83B was activating
additional signaling, we examined whether constitutively
active CRAF (CA-CRAF) or MEK1 (CA-MEK1) proteins
alone could drive HME1 transformation. Retroviruses
encoding CA-CRAF, CA-MEK1, or FAM83B (as a
positive control) were used to infect HME1 cells. Western
analysis was used to confirm the appropriate expression of
each protein, and each HME1 derivative was examined for
AIG (Fig. 1A). As expected, FAM83B expression resulted
in efficient AIG; however, neither CA-CRAF nor CAMEK1 alone was sufficient to promote the AIG of HME1
cells.
Our previous studies demonstrated that RAS-G12Vtransformed HME1 cells require sustained FAM83B
expression to maintain a transformed phenotype,
implicating FAM83B as a key component in RAS/MAPK
signaling. We hypothesized that, if FAM83B functions

solely as an activator of MAPK signaling, then CACRAF or CA-MEK1 should functionally compensate
for FAM83B and allow sustained proliferation following
shRNA-mediated FAM83B ablation. To test this
hypothesis, RAS-G12V-transformed HME1 cells were
infected with retroviruses encoding GFP, CA-CRAF, or
CA-MEK1, then subsequently infected with lentiviruses
encoding shRNAs targeting GFP (G) or FAM83B (B)
before assessing cell number. Western analysis confirmed
the expression of CA-CRAF and CA-MEK1 in the RASG12V-transformed HME1 cells. As expected, ablation of
FAM83B resulted in a significant reduction in cell number
(Fig. 1B). Importantly, neither constitutively active CRAF
nor constitutively active MEK1 was able to rescue RASexpressing cells from the growth inhibition mediated by
FAM83B ablation (Fig. 1B). These results demonstrate
that constitutive CRAF or MEK are not sufficient to drive
HME1 transformation alone, and cannot compensate
for the loss of FAM83B, arguing that elevated FAM83B
expression modulates additional effectors necessary to
drive transformation.
To further define the signaling pathways that
contribute to HME1 transformation, we next compared
FAM83B to RAS-G12V or various RAS-G12V point
mutants capable of activating specific effector pathways,
including RAF (T35S), PI3K (Y40C), or RAL-GEF
(E37G). Western analysis confirmed the expression of
the RAS-V12G proteins (Supplementary Fig. 1A). Both
FAM83B and RAS-G12V expression resulted in efficient
AIG, while each of the RAS-G12V mutants capable of
specific effector pathway activation failed to produce
significant AIG, further supporting the conclusion
that HME1 transformation requires multiple effector
pathways (Supplementary Fig. 1B). In addition, FAM83Bexpressing HME1 cells possess the ability to grow in the
absence of Mammary Epithelial Growth Supplement
(MEGs), which mimics a low growth factor environment
in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 1B). This phenotype could
not be recapitulated by HMEC expressing RAS-G12V
mutants capable of activating single effector pathways
(Supplementary Fig. 1B). Taken together, our results
suggest that FAM83B has additional, growth promoting
and transforming functions that are independent of the
previously described RAF/MAPK activation.
In addition to activating CRAF signaling, FAM83B
expression results in elevated conventional phospholipase
D (PLD) activity. Inhibition of either CRAF or PLD1
suppresses FAM83B-mediated transformation [13].
Therefore, we hypothesized that the combination of
constitutive CRAF activity and elevated PLD activity
would recapitulate FAM83B-mediated transformation.
To test this hypothesis, HME1 cells expressing GFP
or constitutively active CRAF were infected with
retroviruses encoding GFP, PLD1, or PLD2. Western
analysis confirmed the expression of each protein and AIG
was assessed (Supplementary Fig. 2A). Again, expression

of FAM83B promoted efficient AIG while expression of
PLD1 or PLD2 alone or in combination with constitutively
active CRAF was insufficient to promote AIG. Similarly,
only FAM83B expression conferred sustained proliferation
in the absence of Mammary Epithelial Growth Supplement
(MEGs) (Supplementary Fig. 2B). Thus, while CRAF
and PLD activity are required for FAM83B-mediated
transformation, simply co-activating the two pathways is
insufficient to recapitulate the FAM83B phenotypes.

CA-PI3K alone or CA-AKT alone were unable to grow
anchorage-independently, arguing that simply elevating
AKT activity is insufficient for transformation. Next, we
examined whether activation of CRAF/MAPK and PI3K/
AKT signaling together would recapitulate the function
of FAM83B to drive a transformed phenotype. HME1
cells expressing GFP, FAM83B, CA-MEK1 alone, CAPI3K alone, or CA-MEK1 and CA-PI3K together were
created, analyzed by Western analysis and assessed for
AIG (Fig. 2C). Importantly, combined activation of the
CRAF/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathway together resulted
in AIG similar to FAM83B expression.
Having defined PI3K/AKT signaling as a key
effector pathway that cooperates with MAPK signaling
to transform HME1 cells, we next sought to confirm that
FAM83B-mediated transformation requires sustained
PI3K/AKT activity. HME1 cells expressing GFP or
FAM83B were analyzed for AIG in the presence of a PI3K
inhibitor (LY294002) or an AKT inhibitor (MK2206)
(Fig. 2D). FAM83B-mediated AIG was significantly
diminished following inhibition of either PI3K or AKT
activity, confirming that the hyperactivated AKT observed
in FAM83B-expressing cells is critical for FAM83Bmediated transformation. Furthermore, elevated FAM83B
expression diminished the sensitivity of HME1 cells to
therapeutic inhibition of the PI3K/AKT signaling axis,
either by LY294002 (1, 5, and 10 µM) or MK2206 (1,
5, and 10 µM), with as much as a 4-fold increase in cell
number when compared to control GFP-expressing cells
(Fig. 3A and 3B). In addition, we previously demonstrated
that the phosphorylation of mTOR effectors S6K and 4EBP1 was increased in cells harboring elevated FAM83B
expression. The hyperactivation of PI3K/AKT by elevated

Defining the signaling required to recapitulate
FAM83B phenotypes.
FAM83B is one of eight members of a protein
family (FAM83), based solely on the presence of an
N-terminal Domain of Unknown Function (DUF1669).
A recent report by Lee et. al demonstrated that another
member of this family, FAM83A, can activate the PI3K
signaling axis, leading to AKT phosphorylation [14]. To
determine whether FAM83B expression could promote
AKT phosphorylation, FAM83B-expressing HME1 cells
were examined using Western analysis to detect AKT
phosphorylated on Serine 473 (Fig. 2A). Importantly, AKT
phosphorylation was elevated in FAM83B-expressing
HME1 cells, similar to ERK1/2 as we previously reported.
To examine whether elevated signaling through the
PI3K signaling axis is sufficient to drive HME1 cells to
grow anchorage independently, HME1 cells expressing
GFP, FAM83B, constitutively active AKT (CA-AKT),
or constitutively active PI3K (CA-PI3K) were created.
Expression of CA-AKT and CA-PI3K were confirmed
by Western analysis, and AIG was assessed (Fig. 2B). As
observed with CA-RAF and CA-MEK, cells expressing

FAM83B expression provides an explanation for the
increased phosphorylation of these mTOR effectors [13].
Taken together with our previous findings that elevated
FAM83B expression also decreased the sensitivity to
mTOR inhibition, CRAF inhibition, and MEK inhibition,
we conclude that FAM83B-mediated AKT and MAPK
hyperactivation renders transformed cells less sensitive to
therapies targeting each pathway [13].

assessed. The growth of both HCC1937 and MDA468
cells was suppressed in all three assays following
FAM83B inhibition (Fig. 4B-D; [13]). Moreover, ablation
of FAM83B resulted in a strong suppression of both AKT
and ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 4E and 4F). Together, our
data demonstrates that targeted suppression of FAM83B
can simultaneously inhibit two key growth regulatory
pathways downstream of EGFR, namely PI3K/AKT and
MAPK. In addition, we previously noted that HME1
cells expressing mutant RAS were sensitive to FAM83B
ablation, implicating FAM83B as a key signaling
intermediary downstream of mutant RAS. To confirm
the requirement for FAM83B in mutant RAS-mediated
tumorigenicity in vivo, we infected HCT116 colorectal
cancer cells (KRAS-G13D and elevated FAM83B mRNA)
with lentiviruses expressing shRNAs targeting FAM83B
(B) or GFP (G), injected NOD/SCID mice, and measured
tumor formation after two weeks. Again, suppression of
FAM83B resulted in a significant inhibition of both tumor
volume and tumor weight when compared to control,
shGFP-expressing cells (Fig. 4G). Taken together, our
studies define both PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling as
key effectors induced by elevated FAM83B expression
and required for efficient FAM83B- and EGFR/RASmediated transformation.
We next performed a genetic experiment to

FAM83B inhibition suppresses cancer cell growth
and decreases AKT phosphoryation by altering
the subcellular location of multiple PI3K signaling
components.
ShRNA-mediated FAM83B ablation inhibits MAPK
signaling and suppresses the growth of tumor-derived
breast cancer cells harboring elevated EGFR signaling
or mutant RAS [13]. To determine whether PI3K/AKT
signaling is also inhibited in cancer cells following
FAM83B ablation, shRNA targeting FAM83B (B) or
GFP (G) was delivered to HCC1937 and MDA468 breast
cancer cells (harboring elevated EGFR). The efficiency
of FAM83B knock-down was examined by Western
analysis (Fig. 4A) and the proliferation, AIG, and acinar
growth in laminin-rich basement membrane (lrBM) was

determine whether constitutively active AKT (CAAKT), or constitutively active PI3K (CA-PI3K), when
combined with constitutively active MEK1 (CA-MEK)
could prevent the growth suppression observed following
FAM83B ablation. For this, MDA468 cells expressing
CA-AKT and CA-MEK or CA-PI3K and CA-MEK were
created, infected with lentiviruses encoding FAM83BshRNA, and AIG was measured (Fig. 5). While shRNAmediated FAM83B ablation was equivalent among the
MDA468 derivatives (Fig. 5B), the presence of CA-AKT/
CA-MEK or CA-PI3K/CA-MEK resulted in a significant
increase in AIG when compared to control cells (p=0.0024
and p=0.000032, respectively), although this was not a
complete rescue (Fig. 5C and 5D).
To define the mechanism by which FAM83B
activates PI3K/AKT signaling, we examined whether
PI3K signaling components co-precipitated with
FAM83B. We first examined whether FAM83B coprecipitated PI3K subunits by co-expressing FAM83B
together with either the p85α regulatory subunit of PI3K
or the p110α catalytic subunit. FAM83B was able to coprecipitate with both the p85α and p110α subunits (Fig.
6A and 6B). Using a similar assay, we determined that
AKT was also able to co-precipitate with FAM83B (Fig.
6C). In addition, we observed a significant increase in
the amount of membrane-localized p110α and AKT in
FAM83B-expressing cells compared to control cells
(Fig. 6D). Conversely, ablation of FAM83B expression
from MDA468 cells, which suppressed the growth and
tumorigenicity of this cell line, resulted in a decrease in
p110α and AKT membrane localization and subsequently
a decrease in AKT signaling (Fig. 6E and 4G). Together,
our data suggest that the increased level of FAM83B
observed in many cancers results in increased localization

of p110α to the membrane, and activation of downstream
AKT/mTOR signaling (Fig 6D and 2A) and suggests that
the therapeutic targeting of FAM83B may suppress PI3K/
AKT activation and ultimately inhibit tumor growth.

DISCUSSION
Understanding the mechanism by which elevated
FAM83B expression drives cellular transformation will
provide the foundation for future therapies aimed at
suppressing the key functions of this novel oncogene.
Previously, we demonstrated that FAM83B expression
elevates MAPK activity by increasing CRAF membrane
localization. Based on our observations, we put forth a
hypothesis that FAM83B was a key regulator of RAF/
MAPK signaling, and that its function was simply
to connect upstream EGFR/RAS with RAS/MAPK
activation. Surprisingly, when we began examining the
requirements for HME1 transformation, we noted that the
expression of activated CRAF or MEK1 failed to induce
AIG comparable to FAM83B. Additionally, the expression
of RAS-G12V mutants only capable of activating a
single downstream effector pathway (RAF, PI3K, and
RAL) in HME1 cells failed to induce AIG comparable
to RAS-G12V or FAM83B expressing HME1 cells.
Therefore, FAM83B-mediated transformation could not
be recapitulated by any single RAS effector.
During our original characterization of FAM83B
function, we focused on a phospholipase D-like motif
in the N-terminal Domain of Unknown Function 1669
(DUF1669), as it was the only clear functional motif.
Indeed, we observed FAM83B-expressing cells had
elevated PLD activity; however, this was not due to
FAM83B itself but the hyperactivation of PLD1 [13].

to the shGFP control) between the MDA468 derivatives was plotted (d).

Here, we show that increased PLD activity combined
with constitutive CRAF activation failed to recapitulate
FAM83B-mediated transformation. Thus, while PLD
activity is critical for FAM83B-mediated transformation,
additional signaling pathways are also required to

recapitulate the transformed phenotype.
FAM83B is a member of an 8 member protein
family (FAM83) that shares the highly conserved
DUF1669. In addition to our identification of FAM83B,
Lee et al. identified FAM83A in a cDNA library screen for
proteins that confer resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors. Their study identified an interaction between
FAM83A and the PI3K regulatory subunit p85α to activate
the PI3K signaling axis, leading to AKT phosphorylation
[14]. Therefore, we examined whether activated PI3K
cooperated with activated MAPK signaling to recapitulate
the FAM83B-transformed phenotype in HME1 cells.
Indeed, constitutive PI3K/MEK activation yielded the
same level of transformation as FAM83B, suggesting that
FAM83B can activate both effector pathways. In addition,
expression of a constitutively active PI3K or AKT with
constitutively active MEK partially reversed the growth
inhibition observed following FAM83B ablation. The
partial rescue could result from the incomplete activity
of one of the constitutively active proteins (CA-AKT,
CA-PI3K, or CA-MEK) or because FAM83B activates
additional, as yet undefined pathways. In any event, the
finding that the FAM83 proteins activate both PI3K and
MAPK signaling provides an exciting opportunity to
therapeutically target both signaling pathways simply by
inhibiting FAM83B. Furthermore, similar to the FAM83A
studies performed by Lee et al, we identified complexes
involving FAM83B:PI3K and FAM83B:AKT, enhanced
membrane localization of both PI3K and AKT, and
increased AKT phosphorylation. Whether the DUF1669
is responsible for complexes involving PI3K (p85α and
p110α) is an interesting hypothesis since both FAM83A
and FAM83B, which are quite divergent beyond the
DUF1669, were able to co-precipitate with p85α.
Furthermore, the conserved DUF1669 is critical for the
transforming activity of FAM83B and we postulate that
other FAM83 members may also function as oncogene
given the conservation of this domain.
The increased PI3K/AKT activity observed in
FAM83B-expressing cells, together with the activation of
MAPK signaling indicates that FAM83B is an important
protein in RAS effector activation (Fig. 6F). Additional
significance for this observation is provided by our
findings that the growth and tumorigenicity of transformed
cells harboring mutant RAS or elevated EGFR expression
can be significantly suppressed following FAM83B
ablation. Importantly, the growth suppression engaged
following FAM83B ablation is coupled with decreased
CRAF, PI3K, and AKT membrane localization, and a
subsequent suppression of activating phosphorylations
on ERK1/2 and AKT. These results provide compelling
evidence that therapeutically targeting FAM83B may
inhibit both MAPK and AKT signaling simultaneously
in tumors dependent on EGFR/RAS signaling. Combined
therapies targeting MAPK and AKT/mTOR signaling
are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for several

tumor types [9]. However, the complexity of RTK and
downstream signaling interactions continues to limit the
effectiveness of targeted therapies aimed at inhibiting
HER2, EGFR, RAS, RAF and MEK [7;8]. Previously,
we demonstrated that cells expressing elevated FAM83B
levels had a decreased sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs [13].
Given the requirement for FAM83B as an activator
of PI3K/AKT and MAPK in EGFR/RAS signaling,
the levels of FAM83B may be an important factor to
consider when determining which patients receives TKI
treatment [15]. Our significant observation that inhibition
of FAM83B expression can suppress the activity of both
CRAF and PI3K signaling provides an exciting new target
for future therapies aimed at inhibiting both pathways
simultaneously to inhibit tumor growth.

Retroviruses were produced as described [18;19].
Briefly, retroviral vectors were transfected into PhoenixAmpho cells together with a packaging plasmid encoding
the MLV-gag-pol and env genes. Plasmids encoding
shRNAs targeting FAM83B or GFP in pLKO.1 were
acquired from Open Biosystems and Sigma-Aldrich.
Viruses were packaged in 293T cells using the secondgeneration packaging constructs pCMV-dR8.74 and
pMD2G, were kind gifts from Didier Trono (University
of Geneva, Switzerland). Supernatants containing virus,
were collected at 24 and 48 hours and supplemented with
4 µg/ml of polybrene before being frozen in aliquots or
used to infect cells for 6-24 hours.

Immunoprecipitation and Western Analysis
Immunoprecipitation experiments were carried
out as previously described with exceptions as noted
[20;21]. FAM83B and p85, p110, or AKT were
immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG (M2) affinity gel
(Sigma Aldrich), from 293T cells transfected with 4µg
of each plasmid using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
as indicated in each experiment. Whole cell extracts
were prepared by incubating cell pellets in lysis buffer
containing 50 mmol/L of Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mmol/L of
NaCl, 1.0% NP40, 10 µg/mL of aprotinin, 100 µg/mL of
phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride, 5 µg/mL of leupeptin, 5
µg/mL of pepstatin, and 1 mmol/L of NaVO4. Cell extracts
containing equal quantities of proteins, determined by
the Bradford method, were separated by SDS-PAGE
(8–12.5% acrylamide) and transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (Millipore). Antibodies to HA
(F-7), MYC (9E10), HRAS(C-20), and PC-PLD1 (F12) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, antibodies to
ß-actin (pan Ab-5) were from Neomarkers, antibodies to

digital images were analyzed using MetaMorph image
quantification software.

Subcutaneous Tumorigenicity Assays.
NOD/SCID mice were bred and maintained under
defined conditions at the Athymic Animal and Xenograft
Core facility at the Case Western Reserve University,
Case Comprehensive Cancer Center an accredited facility
that acts in compliance with NIH guidelines and provides
veterinary care by several full time veterinary personnel.
HCT116 (1x106) cancer cells were suspended in a 1:1
mixture of media and matrigel (BD Biosciences) and
injected subcutaneously into mice (6-8 weeks of age) that
were sublethally irradiated with 300 rad 4 hours prior to
injection. Tumor volume was calculated with the formula
4/3πr3 and student t-tests were performed.

Soft Agar Assays
For hTERT-HME1 cells, 1 x 105 cells were
suspended in 0.6% type VII agarose (Sigma) and plated
onto a bottom layer of 1.2% agar in a 60mm plate in
triplicate as described [17]. The medium was changed
every 3 days until cells were analyzed after 3 weeks.
To quantify colonies, each plate was scanned using an
automated multi-panel scanning microscope, and the
digital images were analyzed using MetaMorph image
quantification software. For HCC1937 cells, 2 x 105 cells
were plated per 60mm dish and medium was changed
every 3 days until cells were analyzed after 3 weeks.
The specific pharmacological PI3K inhibitor LY294002
was obtained from Sigma Aldrich and the AKT inhibitor
MK2206 was obtained from Selleck Chemicals. Both
compounds were added to the medium during feedings
for indicated experiments.
