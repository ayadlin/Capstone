Abstract
mTORC1 is a central signaling node in controlling cell
growth, proliferation, and metabolism that is aberrantly activated in cancers and certain cancer-associated genetic disorders,
such as tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis. However, while mTORC1-inhibitory
compounds (rapamycin and rapalogs) attracted interest as candidate therapeutics, clinical trials have not replicated the promising ﬁndings in preclinical models, perhaps because these
compounds tend to limit cell proliferation without inducing
cell death. In seeking to address this issue, we performed a highthroughput screen for small molecules that could heighten the
cytotoxicity of mTORC1 inhibitors. Here we report the discovery

that combining inhibitors of mTORC1 and glutamate cysteine
ligase (GCLC) can selectively and efﬁciently trigger apoptosis in
Tsc2-deﬁcient cells but not wild-type cells. Mechanistic investigations revealed that coinhibition of mTORC1 and GCLC
decreased the level of the intracellular thiol antioxidant glutathione (GSH), thereby increasing levels of reactive oxygen species, which we determined to mediate cell death in Tsc2-deﬁcient
cells. Our ﬁndings offer preclinical proof of concept for a strategy
to selectively increase the cytotoxicity of mTORC1 inhibitors
as a therapy to eradicate tumor cells marked by high mTORC1
signaling, based on cotargeting a GSH-controlled oxidative stress
pathway. Cancer Res; 76(16); 4816–27. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

render tumor cell death. In this study, we chose to focus on a
distinct subset of mTORC1-driven tumor cells, which bear mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)-2 tumor suppressor
gene. The TSC tumor suppressor is a heterodimer complex, which
is composed of tuberin (TSC2), a GTPase-activating protein
(GAP), and its activation partner hamartin (TSC1). TSC inhibits
the activity of Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) by stimulating the conversion of Rheb-GTP to Rheb-GDP to suppress
mTORC1 signaling (6).
To explore the possibility of selectively killing tumor cells with
high mTORC1 signaling, we used a high-throughput screening
approach and identiﬁed a set of small molecules that collaborate
with rapamycin to suppress cell metabolism, growth and/or
survival in Tsc2-deﬁcient mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (Tsc2/
MEF). As described below, we selected one combination strategy
for further analysis. Speciﬁcally, we found that inhibition of
mTORC1 together with glutamate cysteine ligase (GCLC) selectively triggers cell death of Tsc2/ MEFs but not wild-type (WT)
Tsc2þ/þ MEFs. At a molecular level, Tsc1/2-deﬁcient cells have
elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS; ref. 7), which is counterbalanced by an mTORC1-driven increase in antioxidants via
NADPH and glutathione (GSH) production. This delicate balancing act is required for cell survival. However, this elevated
equilibrium also creates a potential vulnerability. Thus treatment of Tsc2-deﬁcient cells with rapamycin plus nontoxic doses
of GSH synthesis inhibitor L-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO)
potentiates the generation of ROS. Our results indicate that
Tsc1/2-deﬁcient cells are more susceptible to this further
increase of ROS, resulting in acute cell death. Importantly, this
combination promotes tumor regression of a Tsc2-deﬁcient
Eker rat uterine leiomoma-derived (ELT3)-xenograft tumor

The mammalian or mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1
(mTORC1) senses and integrates signals from growth factors,
nutrients, energy, and oxygen to regulate a wide range of biologic
processes including mRNA biogenesis, protein and lipid synthesis, and autophagy (1). Deregulation of mTORC1 has been
associated with a number of human diseases including cancer,
genetic tumor syndromes, diabetes, as well as obesity (2, 3).
Therefore, drugs that selectively target mTORC1, such as rapamycin, are considered to have a broad impact on a number of
diseases, particularly in treating cancer. Although mTORC1 inhibitors (rapamycin and rapalogs) promote tumor shrinkage, clinical studies showed that tumors returned to their original states
when rapalogs were discontinued, underscoring the cytostatic and
not cytotoxic effects of these agents (4, 5). Thus, there is a critical
need to develop alternative and novel approaches that could

Inhibition of GCLC and mTORC1 in mTORC1-Driven Tumors

Materials and Methods

Transmission electron microscopy
Cells were ﬁxed with 2% glutaraldehyde/2% formaldehyde
in cacodylate buffer, followed by 1% osmium tetroxide. The
samples were embedded in epoxy resin and viewed with a FEI
Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope operated at 80 kV.

Cell lines and culture
Tsc2/p53/ and Tsc2þ/þp53/ MEFs were authenticated
and kindly provided by Drs. Brendan Manning and David Kwiatkowski (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). ELT3 cells were
authenticated and kindly provided by Dr. Cheryl Walker (University of Texas, Austin, TX). ELT3-luciferase cells were described
previously (8). MEFs and ELT3 cells were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and dialyzed for experiments (Gibco). Cells derived from renal angiomyolipomas from
lymphangioleiomyomatosis patients (621-101 TSC2-null cells)
were used and maintained in IIA complete medium with 10% FBS
as described previously (9). All extra energetic additives that are
often added to some DMEM formulations such as sodium pyruvate and succinate were excluded.

Metabolite proﬁling and analysis
Cells were harvested in triplicate, and intracellular metabolites were extracted using 80% (v/v) aqueous methanol.
Targeted LC/MS-MS was performed using a 5500 QTRAP triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer (AB/SCIEX) coupled to a Prominence UFLC HPLC System (Shimadzu) with Amide HILIC
chromatography (Waters). Data were acquired in selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode using positive/negative ion
polarity switching for steady-state polar proﬁling of greater
than 260 molecules. Peak areas from the total ion current for
each metabolite SRM transition were integrated using MultiQuant v2.0 software (AB/SCIEX). Informatics analysis was
carried out using MetaboAnalyst.ca free online software.

model. Overall, our data suggest that targeting oxidative stress
may be a strategy for the treatment of mTORC1-driven tumors.

Small-molecule screening
Tsc2/p53/ MEFs were cultured in glutamine-containing
media with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin in white
384-well plates. After overnight culturing, pin transfer of smallmolecule library was performed at ICCB-Longwood screening
facility. At 48-hour postcompound addition, the plates were
allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for 1 hour. Then
30-mL CellTiter Glo (Promega) was added to each well. The plates
were allowed to sit for 1 minute before being read on the EnVision
Multilabel Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer).
Cell viability measurements
All cell viability experiments were conducted with propidium
iodide (PI) exclusion assay as described previously (10). For all
phase images, the Nikon Eclipse TE300 camera was used, and
images were taken at the indicated time points.
Determination of ROS using dihydroethidium
Cells growin in 6-well plates were treated with compounds.
After treatment, media were removed and cells were washed with
1X PBS. Fresh media containing 10 mmol/L dihydroethidium were
added. After 30-minute incubation, media were removed and
cells were washed with 1X PBS and tyrpsinized with 300-mL
tyrpsin. 1.2 mL of media without the probe was added to the
cells. ROS levels were measured by FACS.
GSH measurement
Cells grown in 6- or 12-well plates were harvested and trypsinized. The trypsinized cells were then resuspended in 0.5 mL of
PBS containing 1% FBS, and incubated with 40 mmol/L monobromobimane (Biochemika) for 10 minutes at room temperature. After incubation, cells were placed on ice and the ﬂuorescence at 485 nm (blue spectra) was measured by ﬂow cytometry.
MitoSOX staining for live cell imaging
Cells grown in 6-well plates were treated with compounds.
After treatment, media were removed and cells were rinsed with
1X PBS. Mitocondiral superoxide level was then measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc)
using Nikon Ti confocal micrsocopy.

siRNA transfections
siRNAs (25 nmol/L; SMARTpool: siGENOME GCLC siRNA
M-043462- 00-0005) were transfected in cells right after being
seeded at a density of 30% to 50% conﬂuency depending on
experiments using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Cells were harvested 36 to
60 hours after transfection as described in the ﬁgure legends.
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis
Total cellular RNA was puriﬁed from cultured cells using the
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol.
For quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), RNA was reversetranscribed using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription
Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting cDNA was analyzed by qRT-PCR using the
QuantiTect SYBR Green qPCR System (Qiagen). A QuantiTect
Primer Assay was used to amplify the target gene. All reactions
were run on an ABI 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR instrument
with a 15-minute hot start at 95 C followed by 40 cycles of a
three-step thermocycling program: denaturation, 15 seconds at
94 C; annealing, 30 seconds at 55 C; and extension, 30 seconds
at 70 C. Melting curve analysis was performed at the end of
every run to ensure that a single PCR product of the expected
melting temperature was produced in a given well. A total of
3 biologic replicates  3 technical replicates were performed for
each treatment group. Data were analyzed using the comparative
Ct method (DDCt method).
GSH/GSSG Glo assay
Cells were plated at 1,000 per well in white 384-well plates and
were allowed to attach overnight. Cells were then treated with
compounds for 24 hours. Media were removed and cells were
washed with PBS. GSH level was then measured according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Promega) with measurement of
lumniscence performed using an EnVision multimode plate
reader.
Animal studies
All animal work was performed in accordance with protocols
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use CommitteeBoston Children's Hospital. Female intact CB17-SCID mice, 6

to 8 weeks of age, were purchased from Taconic. Eker rat uterine
leiomyoma–derived Tsc2-deﬁcient cells (ELT3) were developed
by Howe and colleagues (11, 12). ELT3 cells were transduced
with luciferase tag for bioluminescent imaging. For xenograft
tumor establishment, 2.5  106 cells were inoculated bilaterally
into the lower back region of mice.
Three weeks after cell inoculation, mice bearing subcutaneous tumors were randomized into four groups: vehicle control,
rapamycin (1 mg/kg/day in 0.25% PGE300 and 0.25% Tween
80; i.p., Monday–Friday), BSO (450 mg/kg/day in PBS, i.p.,
Monday–Friday), and rapamycin plus BSO (1 mg/kg/day, i.p.
and 450 mg/kg/day, i.p., Monday–Friday). Drug treatment
was initiated 3 weeks after cell inoculation. Body weight was
measured every week. Tumor volume (length  (width)2/2)
was measured weekly using a Caliper.
Bioluminescent reporter imaging
Ten minutes prior to imaging, animals were injected with
luciferin (Xenogen; 120 mg/kg, i.p.). Bioluminescent signals were
recorded using the Xenogen IVIS System. Total photon ﬂux of
tumors was analyzed (12).
IHC
Histology sections were prepared from xenograft tumor harvested from mice treated with different drugs after 10% formalin
ﬁxation and cutting into ﬁve 1–2 mm sections in cassettes. IHC
was performed on parafﬁn-embedded 10-mm sections using
antibodies against proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; Cell
Signaling Technology). Slides were deparafﬁnized and antigen
retrieval was performed using sodium citrate buffer (pH ¼ 6.0).
Sections were stained followed the instruction of SuperPicture
3rd Gen IHC Detection Kit (Life Technologies).
After staining, slides were viewed on a Nikon Eclipse E400
microscope, and images captured using Spot Insight digital camera with Spot software (Diagnostic Instruments).
TUNEL staining
Histology sections were prepared from xenograft tumor harvested from mice treated with different drugs after 10% formalin ﬁxation and cutting into ﬁve 1–2 mm sections in cassettes.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL) staining was proceeded followed the
instruction of In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (TREVIGEN,
4810-30-K).
Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as mean  SD of at least three independent
experiments. An unpaired, two-tailed Student t test was used to
determine differences between two groups ( , P < 0.05;  , P <
0.01;  , P < 0.001) ANOVA test was used for the analysis of
tumor regression among treatment groups.

Results
Identiﬁcation of rapamycin collaborators through
small-molecule high-throughput screening
In an effort to identify small molecules that collaborate with
rapamycin to induce death in tumor cells with activated
mTORC1, we conducted a small-molecule high-throughput
screen in Tsc2/MEFs. The compound library was composed
of known bioactives, which represent >50% coverage of

FDA-approved compounds. The cells were treated with each
test compound with or without rapamycin, in a 384-well plate
format. After 2 days of incubation at 37 C, cell growth was
determined using the CellTiter-Glo (Promega; Fig. 1A). We
screened 8,247 known bioactives in duplicate, and the effect
of each compound on the cellular response to rapamycin was
determined on the basis of fold changes in cell growth (Fig. 1B
and C). We then cherry-picked 82 "hits" and retested these
compounds at 12 different doses. As a result, we identiﬁed 32
compounds (Table 1), and interestingly, several of which have
been validated previously in the literature. For example,
Goncharova and colleagues reported that the combination of
simvastatin and rapamycin reduces TSC-null tumor growth in
nude mice (13). Also, rapamycin has been shown to synergize
with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib in non–small cell lung,
pancreatic, colon, and breast tumors (14). We next selected
compounds for follow-up studies and we focused on the
combination effect of BSO, an irreversible inhibitor of GCLC,
in collaboration with rapamycin in mTORC1-driven tumor
cells. GSH is synthesized by ligation of glutamate with cysteine
to form g-glutamylcysteine followed by a second ligation to
glycine. The ﬁrst and rate-limiting enzyme of GSH biosynthesis
is composed of a catalytic (GCLC) and a modulator subunit
(GCLM). The second reaction is catalyzed by GSH synthetase to
produce the reduced form of GSH, which is a major and

Inhibition of GCLC and mTORC1 in mTORC1-Driven Tumors

abundant cellular antioxidant (Fig. 1D; ref. 15). As shown in
Fig. 1E, compared with single treatment with BSO alone, a
signiﬁcant decrease in cell growth was observed after treatment
with BSO and rapamycin in a dose-dependent manner, whereas
rapamycin alone caused about 44% decrease in cell growth.
Synergism was assessed by applying the Chou–Talalay method.
The combination of BSO and rapamycin showed synergistic
effect with a combination index (CI) <1.0 (Supplementary
Fig. S1A).
Inhibition of mTORC1 and GCLC induces cytotoxicity
in Tsc2/ MEFs
The assay used for the small-molecule screen measures the
bioenergetic state of the cell. Therefore, to further examine the
biologic consequences of targeting mTORC1 and GCLC, we ﬁrst
examined their effects on the proliferation of Tsc2/ MEFs. We
observed BSO alone (2 mmol/L) to have little effect on cell
proliferation. Rapamycin (20 nmol/L) suppressed proliferation
signiﬁcantly and the combination completely blocked cell proliferation by this assay (Fig. 2A). We next evaluated the effect of
BSO, rapamycin, or BSO plus rapamycin on cell morphology.
Consistent with the data in Figs. 1E and 2A, phase contrast
imaging showed rapamycin (20 nmol/L, 48 hours) appeared to
suppress proliferation, whereas BSO (0.5 mmol/L and 1 mmol/L,
48 hours) had no effect. Importantly, the combination resulted in
a dramatic cell death phenotype (Fig. 2B). We therefore measured
cell death with a PI-exclusion assay (Fig. 2C). FACS analysis
showed that BSO induced dose-dependent cytotoxicity with
rapamycin in Tsc2/ MEFs. Importantly, the RNAi-mediated
knockdown of GCLC also induced cell death in Tsc2/ MEFs in
the presence of rapamycin (Supplementary Fig. S2B) providing
support for the on-target effect of BSO. Rapamycin is known to
mildly induce autophagy in mammalian cells. Interestingly, we
observed increased LC3-II levels in Tsc2/ MEFs treated with
rapamycin (20 nmol/L) plus BSO (10 mmol/L) compared with
WT MEFs after 24-hour culture (Fig. 2D). We also showed
that autophagy inhibitors suppress BSOþrapamycin-induced cell
death (Fig. 2E). In addition, similar to other published data
(16, 17), we demonstrated that the addition of autophagy inhibitors to Tsc2/ MEFs treated with BSOþrapamycin, which block
the last step of autophagy, led to an increased accumulation of
LC3-II (Fig. 2F). When we compared the viability of Tsc2/ MEFs
with Tsc2-WT MEFs treated with rapamycin (20 nmol/L) and BSO
(1, 2, 10 mmol/L), the combination treatment was not toxic to WT
MEFs (Fig. 2B and G and Supplementary Fig. S2A). We also
examined the combination effect of BSO and rapamycin in
Tsc2-deﬁcient ELT3 (ELT3-V3) cells. Similarly, BSO dose-dependently reduced cell viability in combination with rapamycin
in ELT3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Importantly, while de-

creased cell viability with BSO and rapamycin was observed in
ELT3-V3 cells, this was not observed in TSC2-reexpressing ELT3
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2D). Similarly, the combination treatment induced cell death in lymphangioleiomyomatosis patient–
derived 621-102 cells but not in TSC2-add back 621-103 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2E). Thus, although rapamycin but not
BSO reduced cell proliferation, only rapamycin plus BSO-induced
cell death by PI-exclusion assay.
Elevated levels of ROS are responsible for cell death in
Tsc2/ MEFs
GSH is synthesized in the cytosol and then distributed into
different compartments, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic
reticulum (ER), and nucleus (18), and BSO inhibits the synthesis
of the reduced form of GSH (Fig. 3A). We examined the GSH
levels in Tsc2/ MEFs treated with BSO, rapamycin alone, or the
combination. As expected, addition of BSO to Tsc2/MEFs
caused a decrease in GSH levels. Interestingly, cells treated with
rapamycin also exhibited reduced the levels of GSH (Fig. 3B).
Consistently, we observed decreased GSH levels in Tsc2/MEFs
treated with rapamycin by mass spectrometry (Supplementary
Fig. S3A). Recently, our group reported that mTORC1 positively
regulates glutaminase (GLS) and glutamine ﬂux through this
enzyme (19). As GLS converts glutamine to glutamate, which is
a precursor for GSH synthesis, it is likely that rapamycin contributes to the decrease of GSH levels in Tsc2/MEFs by suppressing glutamine–glutamate production through reduction of
GLS production. Importantly, the combination treatment led to
further decrease in GSH levels relative to single-agent treatment
(Fig. 3B). It has been shown that mTORC1 stimulates the
pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and mTORC1 induces
G6PD gene through the transcription factor sterol regulatory
element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP1; ref. 20). G6PD
is the ﬁrst and rate-limiting enzyme of PPP, and plays a critical
role in protection against oxidative stress (21). Oxidized glutathione (GSSG) is reduced to GSH by NADPH, generated by
G6PD (Fig. 3A). Here we also show that rapamycin decreased
the GSH/GSSG ratio (Supplementary Fig. S3B) in Tsc2/ MEFs.
As GSH is a major intracellular antioxidant against oxidative
stress, we then asked whether the elevated levels of ROS are
responsible for the combination-induced cell death. As shown
in Fig. 3C, BSO together with rapamycin showed an increase in
ROS production levels compared with single-agent treatment in
Tsc2/ MEFs. It has been reported that the cellular levels of ROS
were signiﬁcantly higher in TSC2-deﬁcient cells than TSC2reexpressing cells (7, 22). Thus, these observations suggest that
increased ROS levels, as a result of BSO plus rapamycin, are
contributing to death in Tsc2/MEFs. To further examine this
hypothesis, we used antioxidants, N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and

vitamin C. The addition of NAC and vitamin C were able to
reverse cell death induced by BSO and rapamycin as examined
by phase contrast imaging and PI-exclusion assay (Fig. 3D and
E). Moreover, the addition of GSH reduced ethyl ester (GSHMEE), a membrane-permeable derivative of GSH, also rescued
the viability of Tsc2/MEFs treated with BSO and rapamycin
(Fig. 3D and E).
The combination of BSO and rapamycin induces
mitochondrial ROS and alters mitochondrial morphology
ROS have essential roles in normal biologic functions. A
moderate increase in ROS can promote cell growth, proliferation,
and differentiation (23). Nonetheless, an excessive amount of
ROS can cause oxidative damage to DNA, proteins, carbohydrates,
and lipids (24). Thus, it is critical to maintain ROS homeostasis
for normal growth and survival. Unlike normal cells, many types
of tumor cells often display altered redox balance and have
elevated basal levels of ROS relative to nontransformed cells
(25). To cope with the high intracellular levels of ROS, tumor
cells often express increased levels of antioxidant proteins to
perform detoxiﬁcation. As a result, tumor cells are more dependent on antioxidants for cell survival and proliferation than
normal cells (26).
The generation of ROS can occur in several intracellular
sites, such as cytosol, peroxisomes, plasma membrane,
and ER; however, a majority of ROS is produced in the
mitochondria when electrons, which are released from the
mitochondrial respiratory chain due to partial reaction, react
with molecular oxygen, resulting in the generation of the
superoxide anion O2 (24, 27). It has been estimated that the
steady-state concentration of superoxide in the mitochondrial
matrix is 5- to 10-fold higher than that in the cytosol (28). As
mitochondria are the main source of ROS, we asked whether
the combination of BSO and rapamycin further potentiates
the existing ROS levels in mitochondria. To address this question, we ﬁrst tested the basal levels of mitochondrial-speciﬁc
ROS (mtROS) in Tsc2/MEFs versus WT MEFs. As shown
in Supplementary Fig. S4A, the basal levels of mtROS were
elevated in Tsc2/ MEFs compared with WT MEFs staining
with the mitochondrial O2 indicator, MitoSOX Red. MitoSOX
Red is nonﬂuorescent until oxidized by O2 and an increase
in the ﬂuorescence of MitoSOX Red indicates oxidation by
mitochondrial O2. Then Tsc2/ MEFs were treated with
BSO or rapamycin alone, or in combination for 12 hours
and stained with MitoSOX Red. The samples were then
counterstained for MitoTracker Green, which localizes to mitochondria regardless of mitochondrial membrane potential.
Mitochondrial ROS levels were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Interestingly, Tsc2/MEFs treated with BSO or rapamycin showed an increase in mtROS compared with DMSO control. More importantly, the combination treatment showed
a further increase in mtROS levels (Fig. 4A). In addition,
mtROS levels were also examined by FACS analysis, and we
observed a similar effect with the combination treatment of
BSO and rapamycin in Tsc2/ MEFs, but the combination
treatment did not affect ROS levels in WT MEFs (Supplementary Fig. S4A).
Next, we determined whether the drug treatment would
affect mitochondrial morphology by performing transmission
electron microscopy (TEM). Within 24 hours, the combination
treatment of BSO and rapamycin-induced profound morpho-

logic changes of subcellular components (Fig. 4B). Speciﬁcally,
compared with single-agent or DMSO treatment, the combination treatment (BSO: 2 mmol/L, 10 mmol/L; rapamycin:
20 nmol/L) altered mitochondrial morphology by causing the
remodeling of inner membrane structure, cristae. Several lines
of evidence have indicated that increased oxidative stress and
the associated mitochondrial dysfunction can induce cell
death via autophagy (29). In addition, it has been reported
that oxidative stress can induce autophagic cell death independent of apoptosis in transformed and cancer cells but not in
nontransformed cells (30). Interestingly, our study suggested
that BSOþrapamycin treatment cause cell death of Tsc2/
MEFs through a similar mechanism.
Targeting GCLC and mTORC1 with small molecules causes
regression of Tsc2-deﬁcient ELT3 cell xenograft tumors
To test the role of GCLC and mTORC1 inhibition in cells
with mTORC1 hyperactivation in vivo, we used an ELT3 cellxenograft model. Mice-bearing ELT3-luciferase–expressing xenograft tumors were treated with BSO and rapamycin as single
treatments or in combination. We ﬁrst evaluated drug toxicity
by body weight changes, and we did not observe any obvious
effect of drug treatment (Fig. 5A). We next assessed the effect
of combination treatment on tumor development and found
that xenograft tumor size for 5 weeks was smaller than single
treatment of rapamycin by approximately 0.44-fold (Fig. 5B).
Subsequently, compared with the vehicle control, single treatment of rapamycin for 5 weeks reduced tumor growth
by approximately 0.69-fold in bioluminescence intensity
(Fig. 5C and D). More interestingly, in mice treated with
rapamycin alone, although tumor growth was slowed, they
continued to grow after 5 weeks. Interestingly though, tumors
in mice treated with the combination of BSO and rapamycin
grew more slowly than with rapamycin alone for 5 weeks and
then appeared to regress, consistent with suppression of xenograft tumor progression and cell death (Fig. 5D). The immunohistochemical staining showed that the combination treatment of BSO and rapamycin reduced cell proliferation using
PCNA marker (Fig. 5E). Moreover, the combination treatment
of BSO and rapamycin resulted in higher levels of TUNEL
staining indicating the enhanced cell death in tumors relative
to either single agent alone (Fig. 5F).

Discussion
Signiﬁcant efforts have been made to identify inhibitors that
effectively target the oncogenic signaling pathways. Such inhibitors have been proven efﬁcacious in some cases as single agents.
However, monotherapy often has its limitations in targeting
multigenetic diseases, such as cancer. Therefore, drug combinations that impact multiple molecular targets can potentially
provide improved therapeutic beneﬁts, and drug combination
approaches may also lead to the design of therapeutic strategies
that reduce or overcome the development of drug resistance (31).
Combination therapy with rapamycin or rapalogs has been
exploited as an alternative therapeutic strategy (32). A majority
of the ongoing rapamycin-based clinical trials are testing the
efﬁcacy of rapamycin in combination with other agents in
different disease settings (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?
term=rapamycin&pg=4). To identify new drugs that can synergistically collaborate with rapamycin to induce tumor cell death,

we set out to screen against a large library of known bioactives,
which represent 50% of the FDA-approved drugs in Tsc2/ MEFs
and determine the sensitivity of these drugs to mTORC1 inhibition. Interestingly, we found that inhibition of GCLC and
mTORC1 selectively induces death in Tsc2-deﬁcient cells but not
in Tsc2þ/þ cells. We demonstrated that the molecular basis for the
selective toxicity of the combination of BSO and rapamycin was
linked to a reduction of GSH levels and an increase in ROS in
Tsc2-deﬁcient cells. Thus, targeting oxidative stress holds great
promise for the treatment of TSC and sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis as well as cancers.
The intrinsic ROS level is higher in many cancer cell types
compared with their normal counterparts, which can result
from different cellular processes including increased metabolic activity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oncogenic activity (26). A mild increase of ROS levels may result in cellular
alterations linked to an adaptive survival response, whereas a
severe increase of ROS levels can be detrimental to cells. Thus,
cancer cells are more vulnerable to further oxidative damage
triggered by exogenous agents that increase ROS generation. As
a result, shifting redox balance will cause cancer cells to go
beyond their tolerability threshold, and induce cell death (24).
Several strategies have been employed to induce ROS including
ionizing radiation, inhibiting the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway as well as affecting GSH, thioredoxin, glucose, and glutamine metabolisms (33).
BSO is the currently only known inhibitor of de novo GSH
biosynthesis (34). Increased GSH levels have been suggested to
contribute to resistance to chemotherapeutic agents such as
platinum-containing compounds, and melphan, doxorubicin,
and bleomycin (35). Inhibition of GSH synthesis by BSO has
been shown to enhance cytotoxicity with these agents (36–38). In
addition, a new study reported that BSO enhanced the activity of LPhenylalanine Mustard (L-PAM) against multiple myeloma.
Moreover, a recent phase I study demonstrated that BSO and LPAM were well tolerated in neuroblastoma patients (39). On the
basis of previous studies and our ﬁndings, it is critical to identify
novel therapeutic targets involved in redox systems and subsequently develop inhibitors for these targets.
One major concern associated with rapamycin-based therapy
is its safety proﬁle of long-term use as rapamycin suppresses the
immune system, and such therapy may cause serious side effects
including thrombocytopenia and hyperlipidemia, impaired
wound healing, nephrotoxicity as well as altered insulin sensitivity (32). Thus, using low doses of rapamycin in combination

with other agents may provide an alterative approach. In our
in vivo study, we reduced the general doses of rapamycin, and
showed that the combination treatment with BSO effectively
reduced tumor growth. Future work exploring optimal and
clinical doses of rapamycin and BSO remain to be completed.
Taken together, we reveal a new and promising therapeutic
approach by targeting GCLC and mTORC1 in vitro and in a TSCxenograft tumor model. In this current study, we used Tsc2deﬁcient cells as a model to study cells with hyperactive
mTORC1. Future investigation will include testing the efﬁcacy
of this combination treatment in other mTORC1-driven tumor cells, such as those characterized by the loss of function
of tumor suppressors, and/or gain-of-function mutations of
upstream regulators of mTORC1, including PTEN and PI3KCA,
respectively. Further study is warranted to evaluate the therapeutic efﬁcacy of this drug combination.
