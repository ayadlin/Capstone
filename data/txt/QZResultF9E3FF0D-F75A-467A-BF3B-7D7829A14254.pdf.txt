BACKGROUND. Although aggressive dose escalation strategies were designed to
improve the risk-benefit profile of phase 1 oncology trials, they have not been
adequately studied. The prevalence of several novel trial designs and their association with a variety of clinical endpoints was evaluated.

METHODS. A review of the literature was performed to identify phase 1 oncology
studies of cytotoxic agents published from 2002 through 2004.
RESULTS. Of 955 phase 1 oncology articles initially identified, 149 studies, comprising 4532 patients, were analyzed. Only 34% of studies utilized aggressive dose

enrolled fewer than 3 patients to any dose level. Studies that allowed intrapatient
different rates of response or toxicity, nor did they increase the number of
patients who received the recommended phase 2 dose. However, aggressive dose
escalations were associated with increased rates of both hematologic (17% vs
10%) and nonhematologic (17% vs 13%) toxicity with similar response rates. Only
studies that used conservative dose escalation designs and those that studied
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents required fewer
patients to complete a trial. Trials of FDA-approved agents were also associated
with higher response rates than trials of non-FDA-approved agents (10% vs 2%),
without an increased risk of toxicity.

CONCLUSIONS. Several novel aggressive design strategies intended to improve
the risk-benefit profile of phase 1 oncology trials are not associated with
improved clinical outcome, and may be harmful in certain instances. Cancer

s first in human trials, phase 1 clinical oncology trials play a
vital role in translating laboratory science into effective therapies. Traditionally, phase 1 oncology trials begin by administering a
small dose of an experimental agent to a group of 3 or more
patients. Subsequently, cohorts of patients receive increasing
dosages, first by 100%, then 66%, 50%, 40%, and 33% based on a
‘modified Fibonacci’ protocol. Classically, an individual patient may
not receive increasing doses of the investigational agent even if he/
she experiences no significant toxicity. The trial ends when severe or
life-threatening toxicities (DLTs) are experienced by a large fraction
of patients at a given dosage level. The dose just below that which
was associated with excessive DLT is defined as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and is generally recommended for phase 2 efficacy
studies.1–3 Although these elements can vary within ‘conventional’
phase 1 trial designs, we use as our reference point the common

scenario in which all 3 of these features will be stipulated in the design of a trial.
Phase 1 oncology trials have been the subject of
considerable ethical debate for the past 20 years.4–9
In addition to questioning the adequacy of informed
consent,10–14 investigators have claimed that as many
as 60% of patients are treated at ‘subtherapeutic’
dose levels.15–20 A recent study reported increased
overall response rates for patients participating in
phase 1 oncology trials and argued that their overall
risk benefit profile had improved.21 However, it did
not examine whether this problem of ‘undertreatment’ had changed. Moreover, whereas patients enrolled in phase 1 trials that tested therapies already
approved by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) had the highest response rates, response rates
for single-agent trials of cytotoxic drugs remained
stable at 4% and did not appear to contribute to the
overall increase, leading an editorialist to emphasize
the need for improved design strategies in this category of phase 1 oncology trials in particular.22
Consequently, there has been a concerted effort to
devise innovative strategies that would 1) increase the
number of patients receiving phase 2 recommended
doses, and 2) reduce the number of patients needed to
complete a phase 1 trial. Simon et al.23 suggested a variety of aggressive titration designs, including 1) allowing
for intrapatient dose escalation (IPDE), 2) using fewer
patients in earlier dosage levels, and 3) repeatedly
increasing drug dose levels by 100%, and found them to
be somewhat successful when applied to a stochastic
computer model. Importantly, as opposed to other novel
design strategies that measure biologic activity as an
endpoint, these dose escalation strategies were primarily
designed for trials of cytotoxic agents that still use toxicity as an endpoint.24–27
Surprisingly little research has been conducted
to evaluate the frequency with which the 3 aforementioned novel trial designs are being used, or to
establish their associations with important clinical
outcomes.22 A 1996 study found that only a small
minority of trials were utilizing novel designs.2 Conversely, a more recent symposium of prominent
phase 1 investigators suggested that almost every
phase 1 study uses at least some aggressive design
strategy, but provided no empiric data.24
We hypothesized that these more aggressive
novel design strategies were being used in more than
half of all phase 1 oncology trials and would also be
associated with 1) increased numbers of patients
receiving biologically active doses, 2) fewer numbers
of patients needed per trial, 3) increased overall
response rates, and 4) higher toxicity rates. We then
conducted a systematic review of single-agent phase

1 trials of cytotoxic drugs to evaluate the frequency
with which these novel design strategies are being
used and how they correlate with these endpoints.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Selection
Medline was searched to identify single-agent phase 1
oncology trials of cytotoxic agents published between
2002 and 2004. The search criteria initially included
antineoplastic or chemotherapy or cytotoxic and was
limited to humans and the English language. The subset was defined as ‘cancer,’ the publication type was
designated as ‘clinical trial - phase 1,’ and the years of
interest were selected.
Our inclusion criteria were: 1) the study was a
phase 1 cancer chemotherapy trial that conducted
dose escalation, assessed safety, and did not allow
the use of concurrent radiotherapy, cryotherapy, or
photodynamic therapy; 2) only 1 agent was used in
the study; 3) the investigational agent was cytotoxic,
not immunotherapy, a signal transduction inhibitor,
an angiogenesis inhibitor, gene therapy, or a vaccine;
and 4) the study was accessible. Of 955 studies originally identified, 149 satisfied all of these criteria
(Fig. 1).

Data Abstraction
Three investigators (S.A.K., B.K., E.W.) independently
extracted all pertinent information using a formal
abstraction instrument. This included demographics,
prior therapy history, toxicity and response data,
dose escalation strategy, the allowance of IPDE, minimum patients per dose, class and approval status of
agent, and the number of patients who received the
agent at or above the recommended phase 2 dose at
least once. On a review of the abstracted data, discrepancy rates between data points was found to be
<5% overall. Discrepancies were reviewed and
resolved collectively by the abstractors.
Dosing strategies comprised 3 distinct categories:
1) traditional, according to a ‘modified Fibonacci’
protocol (ie, dose increased by 100% then 66%, 50%,
etc.); 2) conservative, in which the initial dose
increase was <100%; and 3) aggressive, in which at
least the first 2 dose increases were by 100%. Study
design was obtained from the methods section of
each published trial in which the investigators disclosed their study design plan before enrolling
patients. Similarly, IPDE was only recorded as
allowed if the study explicitly indicated as such in
the methods section.

dies. For this reason, grade 3 febrile neutropenia was
included as a hematologic toxicity, yet alopecia was
excluded.

FIGURE 1. Study selection. *Includes studies that were not cancer-related,
not phase 1 studies, or dose finding studies; those that did not assess the
safety profile of the agent; those that included the use of radiotherapy,
cryotherapy, or photodynamic therapy; and those for which the trial data was
inaccessible or incomplete. **Includes signal transduction inhibitors, angiogenesis inhibitors, immunotherapy, and gene therapy.

Outcome Definitions
Response data included the number of patients who
experienced a complete response (CR), partial response
(PR), and stable disease (SD) according to standard
definitions. Whereas the majority of solid tumor trials
used the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) criteria to assess response, some used the
World Health Organization (WHO) classification, the
fundamental differences between them being the use
of single linear summation of tumor volume (RECIST)
versus a bilinear product approach (WHO), as well as
the number of lesions in a given organ and/or in total
that are measured.28 Trials for patients with hematologic malignancies used their own standard definitions
for response and progression.
Toxicity data included possible or probable toxic
deaths, nonhematologic toxicity, and hematologic
toxicity. Deaths that were either explicitly reported as
toxic deaths, or that were not expressly reported to
be unrelated to the intervention, were defined as
toxic deaths. All toxicity grades follow the standard
definitions outlined in the Common Toxicity Criteria
(version 2.0; 1999) and/or the Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (vesion 3.0; 2003) as part
of the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) of
the National Cancer Institute. Grade 3/4 nonhematologic and grade 4 hematologic toxicity were recorded
because these determine toxicity rules for dosing
modification in the majority of phase 1 oncology stu-

Statistical Analysis
The unit of analysis was the study. For each study,
rates of response, mortality, and toxicity were calculated based on the published data and exact confidence limits were estimated. For some rates, data
were not available and therefore the rates for these
studies were treated as missing at random. For grade
3 to grade 4 nonhematologic and grade 4 hematologic toxicities, some of the studies only provided information such that the minimum and maximum
number of patients incurring the toxicity could be
ascribed (ie, these studies reported the number of
toxicity events rather than the number of patients
with toxicity events). In these cases, we used a
weighted approach for estimating the true number of
patients who had experienced a toxicity, in which the
estimated number of toxicities (ti) is defined as:
ti ¼ 0:75 3 mini þ 0:25 3 maxi
For example, in 1 study it could be assumed that at
least 6, but no more than 10, patients had grade 4
hematologic toxicities. The imputed number of grade
4 hematologic toxicities for this study was 7 patients.
This estimate is more conservative and also more
appropriate than simply taking the average of the
minimum and maximum.
All multiple regressions were estimated using
meta-analytic techniques. For estimating rates across
studies, a random effects grouped logit regression
model was used in which random intercepts were
assumed for each study. For the multiple regression
models, a random effects grouped logit model was
also used, assuming common effects for covariates
across studies. The model is essentially a generalized
linear model from the binomial family with logit link
in which studies are ‘groups’ (ie, the unit of analysis is
the study) and a random effect is included for each
study. Both of these approaches are meta-analytic,
accounting for variability across studies. Multiple
regression models were not fit for CR and for mortality because the event rates were very low and the
results were unstable. For multiple regression models,
we considered covariates that demonstrated significance in simple regression models. Multiple regression models were explored by including main effects
and pairwise interactions, and then removing insignificant effects and interactions 1 at a time. A Markov
chain Monte Carlo approach was implemented for
estimating parameters. Each of the coefficients in the

regression model was assumed to have a Gaussian
diffuse prior, and random effects were assumed to
have a normal distribution with variance s2, in which
the hyperprior for 1/s2 is a diffuse Gamma distribution. WinBugs within OpenBugs 2.01 was used for
model estimation. For each analysis, a burn-in period
of 5000 iterations was performed. Then an additional
20,000 iterations were run in which every fifth iteration was saved for inference. Multiple chains were run
for each analysis and traceplots were explored to
ensure convergence. No convergence problems were
encountered. Point estimates were defined as the posterior mean, 95% credible intervals as the 2.5th and
the 97.5th percentiles of the posterior distribution,
and tail probabilities as the (2-sided) proportion of
area under the posterior distribution that is more
extreme than the observed data. The tail probabilities
and 95% credible intervals can be interpreted similarly
to P values and 95% confidence intervals. Therefore,
to simplify our reporting and avoid interpretive confusion, we report P values and 95% confidence intervals.

In the 149 phase 1 studies included in the sample,
4350 patients were evaluable for toxicity and 4027
were evaluable for response (Table 1). Patients predominantly had solid tumors (90%), with 9% of studies including only hematologic or lymphatic
malignancies, and 1% of studies accepting patients
with either solid or liquid tumors.
Non-FDA-approved agents were used in 74% of
the studies, whereas 26% of the agents were
approved by the FDA. Overall, 26% of the trials used
traditional ‘modified Fibonacci’ dose escalations, 40%
used more conservative escalation schemes, and only
34% of studies utilized aggressive dose escalation
schemes (Table 2). Studies testing investigational
agents used a conservative dose escalation 32% of
the time, whereas 65% (24 of 38 studies) of studies
testing FDA-approved agents used a conservative
dose escalation strategy. A minority of trials either
permitted IPDE (22%), or enrolled fewer than 3
patients to any dose level (28%) (Table 2).
Of the 4350 patients evaluable for toxicity, 49
(1.1%) died a toxic death. Serious or life-threatening
drug-related grade 4 hematologic and grade 3/4 nonhematologic toxicities were experienced by 15% and
17% of patients, respectively (Table 2). The overall
objective response rate was 3% (CR 1 PR), which
increased to 25% with the inclusion of SD in the definition of response (CR 1 PR 1 SD; Table 2). In addition, 57% of patients received a dose of the study

Relation Between Dose Escalation and Outcome
Unadjusted Analyses
Conservative escalation designs had higher objective
response rates (CR 1 PR 6% vs 2%; P 5 .002) and
higher rates of overall clinical benefit (CR 1 PR
1 SD, 32% vs 21%; P 5 .03) when compared with the
traditional ‘modified Fibonacci’ design (Table 2).29
Conservative escalation strategies also resulted in
the highest percentage of patients that received at
least 1 dose of the investigational agent at or above
the recommended phase 2 dose (71% vs 46%;
P < .001) (Table 2). Trials that used these conservative dose increases were associated with significantly higher hematologic (17% vs 10%; P 5 .01)
and nonhematologic (20% vs 13%; P 5 .03) toxicity
rates (Table 2).
Compared with ‘modified Fibonnaci’-based
designs, aggressive dose escalation strategies were

associated with an increased risk of both hematologic (17% vs 10%; P 5 .01) and nonhematologic
(17% vs 13%; P 5 .20) toxicity (Table 2). However,
there were no associated increases in their rates of
response (CR 1 PR, 1% vs 2% [P 5 .53]; and
CR 1 PR 1 SD, 23% vs 21% [P 5 .79]) (Table 2).
Moreover, the percentage of patients receiving the
recommended phase 2 dose (55% vs 46%; P 5 .18)
was statistically similar for aggressive and traditional
escalation designs (Table 2).

Adjusted Analyses
Only objective response rate (CR 1 PR) and overall
clinical benefit (CR 1 CR 1 PR) were found to be
significantly associated with >1 predictor in simple
regression models. Therefore, according to our a
priori analytic plan, only clinical benefit and objective response were considered as outcomes in multiple regression models. For each model, FDA approval
status and dose escalation strategy, and their interaction terms, were included as predictors. The results

are shown in Figures 2 and 3. In Figure 2 we can see
that trials using FDA-approved agents were associated with higher objective response rates, independent of dose escalation strategy, and that
conservative dose escalation was associated with
higher response rates than other dosing schemes.
There did not appear to be much difference between
the traditional and aggressive designs, and there was
no evidence of an interaction between dose escalation and approval status.
Different patterns are observed for clinical benefit, as shown in Figure 3, in which a minimum number of patients per dose is also included. Trials that
allowed fewer than 3 patients per dose and those
that used FDA-approved agents were associated with
higher rates of clinical benefit (CR 1 PR 1 SD).

Patients who participated in studies that used fewer

(Fig. 3). Because it was not associated with any outcomes in univariate analyses, IPDE was not pursued
in multiple regression models.
Trials with FDA-Approved Agents
Unadjusted Analyses
Studies that tested a drug that had already been
approved by the FDA for another indication were
associated with increased objective response rates
(CR 1 PR, 10% vs 2% [P < .001]) and higher rates
of clinical benefit (CR 1 PR 1 SD, 40% vs 22%
[P < .001]) compared with investigational agents.
Increased tumor response to FDA-approved drugs
was not accompanied by significantly increased risks
of hematologic (18% vs 14%; P 5 .20) or nonhematologic (19% vs 16%; P 5 .38) toxicity (Table 2).
Adjusted Analyses
In multiple regression analyses, FDA approval and
conservative dose escalation design were found to be
independently associated with an increased CR 1 PR
(Fig. 2). FDA approval status was also associated
with clinical benefit (CR 1 PR 1 SD), as shown in
Figure 3, exhibiting a significant interaction with
minimum patients per dose for the first course of
therapy. That is, the relation between fewer patients
per dose and clinical response was stronger in studies of FDA-approved agents than in studies of nonFDA-approved agents.
Number of Patients Required Per Trials
There were no significant differences in the mean
number of patients required to complete those trials
that used aggressive dose escalations, allowed IPDE,
or required fewer than 3 patients per dose relative to
trials that did not use these strategies (Table 3). On
multivariate analysis, among trials of non-FDAapproved agents, conservative dose escalation was
associated with significantly fewer patients needed to

complete a trial compared with trials that used traditional (22.9 vs 31.2; P 5 .01), or aggressive dose escalations (22.9 vs 31.2; P 5 .005). This analysis was
limited in the FDA-approved sample because of the
paucity of trials that used traditional or aggressive
dose escalation strategies (n 5 8 and 2, respectively)
(Table 4).

DISCUSSION
Contrary to our hypothesis, aggressive novel dosing
strategies used in phase 1 oncology trials published
between 2002 and 2004 did not appear to provide
any advantage in the setting of single-agent trials of
cytotoxic drugs. Allowing IPDE, or using fewer
patients in earlier ‘subtherapeutic’ dose levels, were
not associated with increased response rates, or an
increased proportion of patients receiving the recommended phase 2 dose. In addition, trials employing
these aggressive strategies also required, on average,
the same number of patients as their more traditional alternatives. Finally, despite a lack of evidence
supporting increased benefit associated with aggressive dose escalation designs, patients enrolled in
these studies were more likely to experience severe
or life-threatening toxicity.
Aggressive dosing strategies have long been
advocated as a critical means of correcting some of
the ethical pitfalls of phase 1 oncology trials.22,24 The
rationale is that by having fewer patients in lower
dose levels, escalating the dose more quickly, and
allowing patients to increase their own dose, the
number of patients receiving ‘subtherapeutic’ doses
could be reduced. Lending partial support to this
assumption, a study that examined single-agent trials

of both cytotoxic and biologic agents found that
trials that allowed IPDE predicted an increased
response rate with no added risk of toxicity.30 Our
data suggests that this is not the case for single-agent
trials of novel, or FDA-approved, cytotoxic drugs.
Although there appears to be no benefit to allowing IPDE, or using fewer patients per dose level,
these methods do not appear to be any more harmful than standard protocols and may still confer psychologic benefits to patients enrolled.31 When given
the choice, a substantial number of patients chose to
have the highest dose despite the proportionately
increased risk for toxicity.10 Patients may also be
encouraged by the fact that, although older studies
have reported that only 40% of patients received biologically active doses, we found that 57% of patients
overall received a dose equal to, or greater than, the
recommended phase 2 dose.16
The association between aggressive titration
designs and increased toxicity is more concerning
and suggests that aggressively increasing the dose of
a cytotoxic agent in a single-agent phase 1 oncology
trial may adversely impact the risk-benefit ratios that
enrolled patients face. Although more research is
needed to confirm this finding, investigators should
inform their patients of this observation, and give
greater consideration to other methods of reducing
the number of patients treated at ‘subtherapeutic’
dose levels.
Our results for conservative dose escalation strategies appear counterintuitive. We hypothesized that
trials increasing doses more slowly would be associated with more patients being exposed to ‘less
potent’ forms of the drug and therefore with lower
rates of response and toxicity and higher numbers of

patients receiving ‘subtherapeutic’ doses. Quite the
contrary, these studies were associated with higher
response rates, a greater percentage of patients who
received the recommended phase 2 dose, and
increased toxicity rates. One explanation is that
investigators deliberately chose a more conservative
design, perhaps associated with use of a higher starting dose, because of some prior experience with
using a particular agent in routine clinical practice.
This is supported by the fact that of the studies that
tested agents already approved by the FDA, 65%
used a conservative titration design, whereas only
32% of studies that tested novel agents used conservative titration designs.
Our data also suggest that phase 1 oncology
trials of FDA-approved agents may have an inherently different risk-benefit profile than trials of nonFDA-approved agents. Patients that participate in
trials using FDA-approved therapies had significantly
higher rates of response (10% vs 2% for CR 1 PR and
40% vs 22% for CR 1 PR 1 SD) than trials testing
investigational agents, a finding that is consistent
with the results of a recent meta-analysis.21 Trials of
FDA-approved agents also required fewer patients to
achieve completion than studies of nonapproved
agents (25 patients vs 32 patients). Importantly, these
advantages did not come at the price of significantly
higher rates of toxicity. Investigators using FDAapproved agents were likely able to begin at higher
doses that were closer to therapeutic levels, escalate
doses more conservatively, and still achieve a higher
response rate. These findings highlight the importance of distinguishing between phase 1 oncology
trials of FDA-approved agents versus nonapproved
drugs, and should inform the way oncologists consider and present the risks and benefits of these trials
to their patients.
This study has several limitations. First, our sample of studies was heterogeneous with regard to the
agents studied as well as cancer types. This consideration provided the impetus to limit our investigation to single-agent cytotoxic drugs to minimize the
impact that sample heterogeneity would have on our
results. However, in doing so, the generalizability of
our results is limited and does not extend to the variety of design innovations currently being used and
studied in noncytotoxics, most notably biologic
agents and targeted therapies. Second, the lack of
uniform reporting standards as well as publication
biases may have also led to overestimated or underestimated response and toxicity rates. However,
because publication of phase 1 studies is not dependent on response rates, and there was no indication of a suppression of adverse mortality data,

Risks Benefits Phase 1 Trial Design/Koyfman et al.

publication bias may be less likely than in other
types of meta-analysis. The use of varying response
criteria can also be a potential confounder. From a
practical standpoint, our priority was to establish a
large enough sample size to adequately power our
analysis for our primary outcomes. We also reasoned
that because differences between these response criteria are subtle and often yield clinically identical
results, we would be justified including all studies
without controlling for this variable.28 We also did
not distinguish between trials that merely allowed
IPDE by design and those in which patients actually
received increasing dose levels, mostly because of
variability in reporting. Some have also questioned
the utility of stable disease as an endpoint, especially
in uncontrolled, phase 1 trials, in which cancers of
varying biologic behaviors are studied.32 Nevertheless, we included this additional endpoint in our
analysis, relying on our robust and heterogeneous
sample size, and following many recent phase 1 trials
and meta-analyses that have reported significant
findings in this area.21,29 Finally, we must always be
cautious about establishing causality in a retrospective analysis.

Conclusions
Although some novel dosing strategies appear to
have little impact on clinical endpoints, others may
in fact be harmful. The allowance of IPDE and the
use of fewer than 3 patients in initial dosage levels
do not appear to impact response or toxicity rates,
the percentage of patients who receive the recommended phase 2 ‘therapeutic’ dose, or decrease the
average number of patients needed to complete a
trial. Aggressive dose escalation designs expose
patients to greater risk of toxicity with no increased
likelihood of benefit. These innovations do not
appear to deflect some of the most fundamental ethical challenges made against these trials, and perhaps more attention ought to be focused on
alternative models aimed at improving trial design.
For cytotoxic agents, these may include trials that
adjust dosing regimens in a dynamic fashion
throughout the study period, such as the Continual
Reassessment Model (CRM) and its variants, as well
as ‘efficacy toxicity trade-off’ models that use both
toxicity and response data to optimize dosing.33–37
Also, whereas our study was limited to cytotoxics,
using biologic and pharmacokinetic endpoints for
newer noncytotoxic agents may prove more effective
in improving the risk-benefit profile of phase 1 oncology trials.25–27
