Abstract
Treatment with gefitinib, a specific inhibitor of epidermal
growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TK), has
resulted in dramatic responses in some patients with non–
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Most patients who respond to
gefitinib have EGFR-TK mutations; however, >10% of patients
with EGFR-TK mutations do not respond. Similarly, some
patients without EGFR-TK mutations respond to this drug,
suggesting that other factors determine sensitivity to gefitinib.
Aberrations of the tumor suppressor gene p53 are frequently
associated with drug resistance. In this study, we investigated
the role of p53 in growth-inhibitory and apoptotic effects of
gefitinib in the human NSCLC cell lines NCI-H1299 and A549,
which have no EGFR-TK mutations. NCI-H1299 cells, which
had a p53-null genotype, were more resistant to gefitinib
compared with A549 cells, which were wild-type p53 (IC50,
40 Mmol/L in NCI-H1299 and 5 Mmol/L in A549). Treatment of
A549 with gefitinib resulted in the translocation of p53 from
cytosol to nucleus and the up-regulation of Fas, which was
localized to the plasma membrane. In the stable H1299 cell
line with tetracycline-inducible p53 expression, induced p53
enhanced growth inhibition and apoptosis by gefitinib
through the up-regulation of Fas and restoration of caspase
activation. A caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, reduced these
effects. Conversely, inhibition of p53 using antisense oligonucleotide in A549 caused a significant decrease in apoptosis by
gefitinib and down-regulation of Fas under the same
conditions. In conclusion, p53 may play a role in determining
gefitinib sensitivity by regulating Fas expression in NSCLC.

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide,
representing more deaths than those from prostate, breast, and
colorectal cancers combined (1). The overall 5-year survival rate of
individuals with lung cancer remains at f14% because only a
minority of patients can be candidates for radical treatment with
curative intent, and the effect of systemic therapies has been
modest (2). Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies to improve the
prognosis of lung cancer are urgently needed.
Recent advances in cancer biology have identified many
therapeutic targets related to the growth and survival of cancer

cells. One of these targets is the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), which is highly expressed in numerous types of human
cancer and acts as a strong prognostic indicator in head and neck,
breast, ovarian, cervical, bladder, and esophageal cancers (3).
Gefitinib (Iressa) is an orally active EGFR tyrosine kinase (EGFRTK) inhibitor that shows good tolerability and antitumor activity
in patients with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) refractory
to platinum-based chemotherapy (4, 5). Somatic mutations in
the EGFR-TK domain are important predictors of an individual’s
response to gefitinib (6, 7). EGFR mutations are more prevalent in
females, nonsmokers, adenocarcinoma, and Asian heritage (8, 9).
Although most patients who respond to gefitinib have EGFR-TK
mutations, >10% of patients with EGFR-TK mutations do not
respond to gefitinib. Similarly, some patients in whom EGFR-TK
mutations are absent respond to this drug. In addition, most
patients achieving stable disease have wild-type EGFR, suggesting
that other factors are involved in determining sensitivity to
gefitinib (10).
p53 is a nuclear phosphoprotein that plays an important role in
apoptosis, growth arrest, genomic stability, cell senescence, and
differentiation. p53 mutations are the most common genetic
changes found in human cancers, including lung cancer (f70% of
small cell lung cancer and 50% of NSCLC; ref. 11). Mutations of
this gene often result in loss of p53 function and p53 inactivation
(12, 13), contributing to aggressive tumor behavior and therapeutic
resistance (14). Several reports have shown that the expression of
wild-type p53 is necessary for the cytotoxic response to chemotherapeutic agents (15–17), although there are some conflicting
results (18, 19).
We examined whether sensitivity to gefitinib could be affected by
the status of p53 expression in NSCLC lines without EGFR-TK
mutations. In addition, the molecular mechanisms underlying the
effect of p53 on gefitinib-induced cell growth inhibition and
apoptosis were investigated.

(Gentra Systems, Plymouth, MN). DNA (100 ng) was amplified in a 20-AL
reaction solution containing 2 AL 10 buffer (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany), 1.7 to 2.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 250 Amol/L deoxynucleoside
triphosphate, 2.5 units of DNA polymerase (Roche), and 0.3 Amol/L of
each primer pair for EGFR. Amplification of EGFR was carried out using
primers detailed in Table 1. Fragments of EGFR were amplified with a
5-min initial denaturation at 94jC followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at
94jC, 1 min at 57jC, and 1 min at 72jC, with a final 10-min extension
at 72jC. PCR of EGFR was targeted for exons 18, 19, 20, and 21 in the
critical kinase domain. DNA sequencing was done as described
previously (20). DNA purification and EGFR DNA sequencing were done
in separate laboratories.
MTT assay. Briefly, cells in the logarithmic growth phase were
harvested and seeded in 96-well plates overnight. Gefitinib was added
and cells were incubated for 72 h. The viability of cells was determined
using the MTT assay in accordance with the method described by
Carmichael et al. (21).
Apoptosis assay. Apoptosis was quantified using the Annexin V-FITC
apoptosis kit (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were trypsinized (Invitrogen),
pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in Annexin V–binding buffer
(150 mmol/L NaCl, 18 mmol/L CaCl2, 10 nmol/L HEPES, 5 mmol/L KCl,
1 mmol/L MgCl2). FITC-conjugated Annexin V (1 Ag/mL) and propidium
iodide (50 Ag/mL) were added to cells and incubated for 30 min at room
temperature in the dark. Analyses were done on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). The data were analyzed with CellQuest software
(Becton Dickinson).
Western blot analysis. Cells were washed with PBS and solubilized in
lysis buffer (25 mmol/L HEPES, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Triton
X-100, 10 mmol/L EDTA, 10 mmol/L NaF, 125 mmol/L NaCl). The protein
was then collected after centrifugation at 10,000  g for 10 min at 4jC. The
resulting supernatant (50 Ag) was separated on 8% to 12% SDS-PAGE and
transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The membranes were blocked with 5%
skim milk-PBS-0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature before being
incubated overnight with primary antibodies specific for caspase-8 (4-1-20;
1:1,000; Pharmagene, San Diego, CA), caspase-9 (Poly1330; 1:1,000;
Pharmagene), caspase-3 (E-8; 1:2,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA), h-actin (AC-74; 1:4,000; Sigma Chemical), p53 (DO-7; 1:2,000;
DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA), Ref-1 (N-16; 1:2,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Fas (1:1,000; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), Bax (1:2,000;
DakoCytomation), or p21 (C-19; 1:2,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted
in 5% skim milk-PBS-0.1% Tween 20. The membranes were then washed
thrice in 1 PBS-0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies diluted to 1:2,000 in 5% skim
milk-PBS-0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h. After successive washes, the membranes
were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham
Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).
Fluorescent immunocytochemistry. The cells were cultured in 60mm dishes in the presence or absence of gefitinib for 48 h. Collected
cells were fixed with cold methanol for 10 min and washed thrice with
PBS. Next, they were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for
5 min followed by blocking with goat serum and 5% bovine serum albumin
for 1 h. Cells were stained with monoclonal antibodies to p53 or Fas at
2 Ag/mL for 6 h, washed twice with PBS, and incubated with FITC-

conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:20) or anti-rabbit IgG (1:50) for 1 h. The
slides for translocation of p53 were counterstained with propidium iodide
(0.5 Ag/mL) to observe DNA and then washed and coverslipped. Slides
were viewed under a confocal laser scanning microscope (TC SP2; Leica,
Heidelberg, Germany) and green fluorescence, and the images were
photographed.
Preparation of nuclear extracts. Nuclear extracts from cells were
isolated using a nuclear extract buffer kit in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Briefly, cells were treated
with gefitinib for 48 h and then washed with cold PBS. The cellular
membrane was then lysed by adding CER buffer and incubating on ice for
5 min. After centrifugation at 15,000  g for 5 min, the pellets were
resuspended in NER buffer and shaken for 2 h at 4jC to release the nuclear
proteins. After centrifugation at 15,000  g for 5 min, the supernatant was
aliquoted and stored at 80jC until use.
Construction of stable cell lines. p53 cDNA was constructed by PCR
using the pcDNA4/TO expression vector (Invitrogen). This placed the p53
open reading frames under the translational control of the phCMV/TetO2
promoter containing the tetracycline (Tet)-responsive element immediately
upstream of the minimal cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The pcDNA4/
TO-p53 plasmid was cotransfected into NCI-H1299 cells with pcDNA6/TR,
a plasmid that confers blasticidin resistance, to allow the selection of stable
transfectants. Stable clones of NCI-H1299-pcDNA4/TO-p53-pcDNA6/TR
(H1299/p53) constitutively express the Tet-controlled repressor TetR, which
interacts with and inactivates the phCMV/TetO2 promoter in the absence of
doxycycline in the culture medium. After transfection, H1299/p53 cells were
exposed for 2 to 3 weeks in zeocin-containing (Invitrogen) and blasticidincontaining medium (800 Ag/mL zeocin and 10 Ag/mL blasticidin) to select
cells that express resistance to this marker. Colonies were picked for their
resistance to zeocin and blasticidin. The expression of several individual
clones derived from each transfection was tested in the presence or absence
of doxycycline.
Transfection of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by Bioneer Co. (Seoul, Korea) in the
form of phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides. The sequence of p53
antisense oligodeoxynucleotide was 5¶-CCCTGCTCCCCCCTGGCTCC-3¶ and
the control oligodeoxynucleotide was 5¶-GGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGG-3¶
(22). These oligodeoxynucleotides were used for transfection in cells. The
cells (5  105 per p35 dish) were transfected with 100 nmol/L of control or
antisense oligodeoxynucleotides by using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen)
in 1 mL of serum-free medium for 5 h at 37jC in a CO2 incubator in
accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. Then, 1 mL DMEM
with 20% FBS was added without removing the transfection mixture, and
incubation proceeded for an additional 24 h. After transfection, the cells
were treated with gefitinib for 48 h and the apoptosis assay was conducted
as described above.

Results
A549 cells were more sensitive to gefitinib compared with
NCI-H1299 cells. The effects of gefitinib on the viability of NCIH1299 (p53-null genotype) and A549 (p53 wild-type genotype)
cells were examined. Cells were treated with various concentrations of gefitinib for 72 h. As shown in Fig. 1A, gefitinib

p53 Enhances Gefitinib-Induced Inhibition and Apoptosis

Figure 1. A549 cells were more sensitive to gefitinib compared with NCI-H1299 cells. A, A549 and NCI-H1299 cells were treated with the indicated doses of gefitinib
for 72 h. The viability of cells was determined using the MTT assay. B, cells were treated with or without 20 Amol/L gefitinib for the indicated times. Cells were
harvested, stained with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of apoptotic cells was expressed as the sum of
the bottom right (early state of apoptosis) and top right quadrants (late stage of apoptosis). Columns, mean of three experiments; bars, SE. C, under identical conditions

exhibited antiproliferative effects in a dose-dependent manner in
A549 and NCI-H1299 cells; however, A549 cells were more
sensitive to gefitinib than NCI-H1299 cells (IC50, 5 Amol/L in
A549 cells and 40 Amol/L in NCI-H1299 cells). We further assessed
apoptosis in cells that were exposed to 20 Amol/L gefitinib using
flow cytometry after Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide
staining. Gefitinib induced more apoptosis in A549 cells than in
NCI-H1299 cells in a time-dependent manner, with f15% to
60% apoptosis in A549 cells and f3% to 20% in NCI-H1299
(Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis showed that procaspases were
markedly reduced in gefitinib-treated A549 cells; however,
procaspase reduction did not occur in NCI-H1299 cells (Fig. 1C).

In addition, the reduction of procaspases led to increase of
cleaved forms (see Supplementary Fig. S1). A549 and NCI-H1299
cells do not have EGFR-TK mutations in the exon 18 to 21
sequence, showing that the difference in sensitivity to gefitinib
between the two cell types was not caused by EGFR-TK mutations
(Table 2).
p53 was translocated to the nucleus and increased Fas
expression in gefitinib-induced apoptosis. Wild-type p53 is
a critical transcription factor that responds to signals from a
wide range of cellular stresses. To investigate the possible roles of
p53 in the gefitinib-mediated cytotoxicity of NSCLC, A549 cells
were treated with gefitinib for 48 h, and then total protein and

Figure 2. Gefitinib-induced apoptosis was accompanied by accumulation of p53 in the nucleus. A549 cells were treated with the indicated doses of gefitinib for 48 h.
A, total protein lysates or nuclear extracts of A549 cells were treated as indicated and Western blot analyses for p53, Ref-1, and h-actin were done. B, the treated
A549 cells were fixed with 95% methanol, immunostained with anti-p53 (green fluorescence) and propidium iodide (red fluorescence), and analyzed by confocal
microscopy to determine the intracellular localization of p53. Each photograph is representative of three independent experiments.

nuclear extracts were separated on a SDS-PAGE gel and Western
blot analysis was done. Furthermore, duplicated samples were
measured to localize p53 in the cell. Although the amount of p53
did not change in gefitinib-treated A549 cells, p53 accumulated
in the nucleus (Fig. 2A and B). Unequal protein loading was not
the cause of this apparent difference in p53 distribution between
gefitinib-treated and nontreated A549 cells because no difference
in h-actin, or the nuclear protein marker Ref-1, was observed.
The low amount of h-actin observed in nuclear extracts indicated

that very little cytoplasmic protein contamination of the nuclear
extracts had occurred. Nuclear translocation of p53 can lead to
up-regulation of the Fas gene as well as several other genes,
including Bax and p21. Therefore, the expression of these genes
was quantified using immunostaining and Western blotting.
There was no difference in p21 and Bax expression in A549 cells
treated with gefitinib for 48 h (Fig. 3A). However, the level of
Fas increased on gefitinib treatment and Fas was localized to the
plasma membrane (Fig. 3A and B). These data show that the

p53 Enhances Gefitinib-Induced Inhibition and Apoptosis

Figure 4. Reconstitution of p53 in NCI-H1299 cells enhanced sensitivity to gefitinib via activation of caspases. A, H1299/p53 cells were treated with indicated
doses of doxycycline (Dox) for 24 h. Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using anti-p53, anti-p21, and anti-h-actin antibodies. B, cells were
treated with 20 Amol/L gefitinib in the presence or absence of doxycycline (1 Ag/mL) for the indicated times. Apoptotic cells were determined by flow cytometry.
C, under identical conditions of apoptotic analysis, proforms of caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, and Fas were analyzed by Western blotting. D, after treatment with
doxycycline (1 Ag/mL), cells were incubated with 20 Amol/L gefitinib for 48 h with or without preincubation in 20 Amol/L Z-VAD-fmk. Columns, mean of three
experiments; bars, SE. P values were calculated to assess the effect of Z-VAD-fmk. *, P < 0.04; **, P < 0.02.

translocation of p53 to the nucleus and the up-regulation of Fas
are involved in gefitinib-induced apoptosis.
Reconstitution of p53 in NCI-H1299 cells enhanced
sensitivity to gefitinib. To determine whether the restoration
of p53 influences gefitinib-induced apoptosis, we used the lung
cancer cell line NCI-H1299, which lacks p53 expression because of
homozygous deletion of the gene (23). For the expression of
p53, we introduced full-length p53 into the pcDNA4/TO expression vector. In this vector, p53 was placed downstream of the
Tet-responsive element, which can turn the CMV promoter on
and off. The pcDNA4/TO-p53 plasmid was cotransfected into
NCI-H1299 cells with pcDNA6/TR, which encodes a Tet repressor,
and stable cell lines were obtained following antibiotic selection.
After treatment with the Tet analogue doxycycline, H1299/p53
cells exhibited induction of p53 in a dose-dependent manner
at 24 h (Fig. 4A). In particular, the level of p53 expression was
saturated by doxycycline (1 Ag/mL). A similar increase was
observed in the expression of the classic p53 target genes
p21WAF-1/CIP-1. The observed changes in cell growth and cell responses to gefitinib after restoration of p53 are displayed in Table 2.
No significant difference, in accordance with the reconstitution of
p53, was observed in in vitro cell growth (doubling time of 15.8 h in
NCI-H1299 cells and 16.2 h in H1299/p53 cells; P < 0.02) and
microscopic morphology. However, restoration of p53 enhanced the
sensitivity to gefitinib (IC50, 40 Amol/L in NCI-H1299 cells and 12

www.aacrjournals.org

Amol/L in H1299/p53 cells). The incubation of cells for the
indicated times with 20 Amol/L gefitinib resulted in a marked
increase in time-dependent cell death in H1299/p53 (+Dox) cells
( from f10% to 52%; Fig. 4B), which was much less obvious in
H1299/p53 (Dox) cells ( from f6% to 17%; Fig. 4B). Under the
same conditions, an increase in Fas expression was found only in
p53-induced cells in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, the activation of caspases, which can be regulated by the
Fas/FasL system, was restored, like the apoptosis in A549 cells, by
gefitinib (Fig. 4C). To assess whether the activated caspases are
necessary for apoptosis induced by gefitinib, cell-permeable Z-VADfmk was used to inhibit the activation of caspases (24). As shown
in Fig. 4D, Z-VAD-fmk significantly inhibited gefitinib-mediated
apoptosis in H1299/p53 (Dox) and H1299/p53 (+Dox) cells ( from
f17% to 10% and 30% to 5%, respectively). Together, these
findings indicate that the restored p53 enhanced gefitinib-induced
apoptosis via the activation of caspases by the Fas/FasL signaling
pathway.
Silencing of p53 reduced gefitinib-induced apoptosis via
down-regulation of Fas. We examined whether the increase in
Fas depends on p53 in gefitinib-induced apoptosis and whether
inhibition of p53 influences sensitivity to gefitinib. Here, a p53
antisense oligodeoxynucleotide was used to block the effect of
p53 in gefitinib-induced apoptosis. The level of p53 and p21
expression decreased when A549 cells were treated with 10

After transfection of cells with the p53 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide, gefitinib-induced apoptosis decreased from 53% to 15%
(Fig. 5B and C). Moreover, this decrease was accompanied by a
decrease in Fas expression (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these results
indicate that the regulation of Fas by p53 affects the cellular
response to gefitinib.

Discussion
Many previous studies have reported that viral or inducible p53
gene delivery could lead to a significant level of cell death in many
cancer cell lines (25, 26). We conducted reconstitution of p53
through Tet-inducible transfection in NCI-H1299 cells, which do
not express wild-type p53. However, cell death was not detected by
p53 expression itself within the experimental time of our study
(data not shown). This may be due to the different cell types and
the amount of p53 expression. It was interesting that sensitivity to
gefitinib was enhanced by reintroduction of p53 in NCI-H1299 cells
and the inhibition of p53 in A549 cells by antisense oligonucleotide
reduced gefitinib-induced apoptosis. Moreover, the reintroduction
of p53 enhanced Fas expression and led to activation of caspases
(caspase-9, caspase-8, and caspase-3), which can induce effective
apoptosis. These findings imply that p53 is required for the
enhancement of gefitinib-induced apoptosis.
An intact apoptotic pathway is necessary for chemotherapyinduced cell death, and conversely, abnormality in the ability of a
cell to undergo apoptosis may lead to chemotherapy resistance

(27). Several previous studies have shown that activation of
caspase system is involved in gefitinib-induced apoptosis,
although the kind of caspase activation could be different
according to the investigated cell type (28–30). We found that
20 Amol/L gefitinib did not activate caspases in NCI-H1299
cells, a relatively resistant cell line proven by MTT assay, which
contrasts with our results for A549 cells. Thus, the restoration
of caspase activation might increase sensitivity to gefitinib in
NCI-H1299 cells. In the present study, reintroduction of p53
enhanced apoptosis and activated caspase cascade in NCI-H1299
cells. Moreover, enhanced apoptosis and caspase activation after
gefitinib treatment were suppressed by pretreatment with
pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-fmk). Therefore, it is likely that
activation of caspases via reintroduction of p53 results in
enhanced apoptosis.
Our study showed that gefitinib treatment resulted in nuclear
translocation of p53 and enhancement of apoptosis through
reintroduction of p53. These results suggest that p53 acts as a
necessary factor for apoptosis induced by gefitinib treatment.
Although the exact mechanism by which p53 promotes apoptosis
is not fully understood, the p53-dependent expression of
proapoptotic genes, such as Bax and Fas, has been suggested
to be a possible mechanism (31, 32). In fact, it was reported that
gefitinib induced apoptosis through activation of Bax in human
gallbladder adenocarcinoma cells (33). In addition, they showed
that activation of Bax was independent on p53 as significant
change of p53 was not detected. However, our study showed that
Bax was not involved in p53-dependent apoptosis induced by

p53 Enhances Gefitinib-Induced Inhibition and Apoptosis

gefitinib in lung cancer cells. Although the difference of
investigated cell type might contribute to these results, other
determining factors to activate the pathway leading to cell death
should be clarified.
Several studies have shown that p53 (reintroduction of p53 by
viral vector or activation of p53 by stress) is associated with upregulation of Fas (34, 35), and the Fas promoter contains a p53responseive element (36). Thus, the loss of wild-type p53 protein
expression has been widely believed to also result in the loss of Fasinduced apoptosis (37). A recent study showed that gefitinib
treatment up-regulated Fas in lung cancer cells (38). However, the
mechanism of gefitinib-induced Fas expression was not elucidated.
Our data showed that wild-type p53 increased the expression of Fas
in endogenous or exogenous p53 expression model. In addition,
enhanced Fas expression was localized to plasma membrane.
Interestingly, this phenomenon was caused by treatment of
gefitinib in the presence of p53, not by induced p53 expression
alone. Conversely, the inhibition of p53 in A549 cells by antisense
oligonucleotide reduced Fas expression and apoptosis, suggesting
that Fas is an important transcriptional target of p53 mediating
gefitinib-induced apoptosis. Fas-mediated apoptosis may explain
the short response time of gefitinib in patients with NSCLC

compared with other chemotherapeutic agents, although the major
antitumor effect of gefitinib is cytostatic (39).
In the era of targeted and tailored therapy, it is very important to
identify the predictive factors for response to several agents
directing molecular pathways involved in cancer development and
progress. Although EGFR-TK mutations mainly contribute to the
response to gefitinib, we believe that p53 also may be a useful
variable determining clinical response, especially in NSCLC without
EGFR-TK mutations.
In summary, we have shown that p53 enhances gefitinib-induced
growth inhibition and apoptosis by modulating Fas and the caspase
system in NSCLC cells without EGFR-TK mutations. However, our
data do not show the mechanism by which gefitinib inhibits EGFR
signaling, which leads to the activation of p53. Further detailed
studies are required to clarify this mechanism and the clinical
usefulness of p53 as a marker for gefitinib sensitivity in NSCLC.
