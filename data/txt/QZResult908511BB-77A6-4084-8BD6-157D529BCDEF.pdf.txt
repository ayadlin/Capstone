Abstract
Resistance to anthracyclines and other chemotherapeutics due to P-glycoprotein (pgp)-mediated export is a
frequent problem in cancer treatment. Here, we report that iron oxide–titanium dioxide core-shell nanocomposites can serve as efﬁcient carriers for doxorubicin to overcome this common mechanism of drug resistance in
cancer cells. Doxorubicin nanocarriers (DNC) increased effective drug uptake in drug-resistant ovarian cells.
Mechanistically, doxorubicin bound to the TiO2 surface by a labile bond that was severed upon acidiﬁcation
within cell endosomes. Upon its release, doxorubicin traversed the intracellular milieu and entered the cell
nucleus by a route that evaded pgp-mediated drug export. Confocal and X-ray ﬂuorescence microscopy and ﬂow
cytometry were used to show the ability of DNCs to modulate transferrin uptake and distribution in cells.
Increased transferrin uptake occurred through clathrin-mediated endocytosis, indicating that nanocomposites
and DNCs may both interfere with removal of transferrin from cells. Together, our ﬁndings show that DNCs not
only provide an alternative route of delivery of doxorubicin to pgp-overexpressing cancer cells but also may boost
the uptake of transferrin-tagged therapeutic agents. Cancer Res; 72(3); 769–78. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Doxorubicin is one of the most widely used chemotherapy
agents. Although its normal tissue toxicity may complicate its
therapeutic use, the most serious problem with doxorubicin is
the development of drug resistance, especially in ovarian,
colon, and breast cancers (1–3). Resistance is typically mediated by overexpression of P-glycoprotein (pgp), a membrane
transporter that actively pumps doxorubicin out of the cell (4).
Different doxorubicin formulations and modiﬁcations that
allow it to evade membrane transporters have been the subject
of many new doxorubicin-containing drug formulations, many
of them using nanotechnology (5, 6).
Ovarian carcinoma cell lines A2780 (doxorubicin sensitive)
and A2780/AD (doxorubicin resistant) used in this study were
derived from the same tumor but are not isogenic (7, 8) and
have different pgp status and endocytic potential. The goal of
this work was to enable accumulation of doxorubicin in pgpAuthors' Afﬁliations: Departments of 1Radiation Oncology and 2Radiology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago;

overexpressing A2780/AD. Pharmacologic inhibition of pgp
can be achieved with calcium antagonists such as verapamil,
which has been shown to improve efﬁcacy of doxorubicin in
ovarian cancer cells by a dose-modifying factor of 3 to 12 in
resistant cells. Nevertheless, verapamil causes alterations
in calcium metabolism which affect many additional cellular
processes (7). The use of an alternative route for doxorubicin
delivery may not only boost accumulation of doxorubicin in
A2780/AD cells but also help us study the mechanisms of their
doxorubicin resistance, irrespective of pgp overexpression and
provides new ways to overcome them. The approach we
present here introduces doxorubicin into A2780/AD cells
through a 2-step process—doxorubicin enters the cells
attached to nanocomposites, detaches from the nanocomposite surface following natural acidiﬁcation of endosomes, and
permeates through the intracellular milieu ultimately reaching
the cell nucleus.
Doxorubicin nanocarriers (DNC) used in this work were iron
oxide–titanium dioxide core-shell nanocomposites with a 2 to
3 nm core diameter and 6 to 8 nm nanocomposite diameter.
These nanocomposites were selected as a vector for doxorubicin with the intention to develop a theranostic agent for
subsequent in vivo experiments. The core of these nanocomposites is superparamagnetic; the presence of the shell does
not alter their capacity for use as contrast agents for MRI (9).
Below 20 nm, the physical strain on the titanium-oxygen bonds
on the nanoparticle surface causes high reactivity: these bonds
can be broken easily to form stable polar covalent bonds with
hydroxyl groups of catechol ligands such as dopamine and
Alizarin Red S (10–14). At the same time, surface TiO2 molecules form less stable bonds with other hydroxyl group containing molecules (15–20). We found that the interaction

between the TiO2 surface and doxorubicin is relatively labile
and is pH-dependent and show several lines of evidence for
doxorubicin dissociation from nanocomposites inside cells.
Despite expression of transferrin (Tf) receptors 1 and 2 (TfR1
and 2) by both cell lines, A2780 and A2780/AD cells have
different potential for transferrin uptake by clathrin-mediated
endocytosis (CME). Similarly, active uptake of DNCs is unequal
as well. Surprisingly, while DNCs provide an alternative route of
delivery of doxorubicin to pgp-overexpressing cells, they also
modulate delivery of transferrin, providing a new route to
boost uptake of transferrin-tagged therapeutics.

Materials and Methods
Nanoconjugate preparation
Core-shell nanoparticles (referred to as "nanocomposites") were prepared using a low-temperature alkaline
hydrolysis method adapted from several procedures
(9, 21, 22). Brieﬂy, 2 to 3 nm Fe3O4 nanoparticles were
prepared and used as cores for the addition of a TiO2 shell,
for a ﬁnal diameter of 6 to 8 nm. Sizing was done by atomic
force microscopy on an Multimode V AFM (Veeco). Images
were analyzed using Nanoscope Analysis version 1.2 software (Veeco). Concentrations of Fe and Ti were determined

on an X-series 2 ICP-MS (Thermo-Fisher Scientiﬁc). Nanocomposite Concentrations was 30 mmol/L; the average concentration of surface Ti atoms and potential surface-binding
sites was 24 mmol/L (calculations in Supplementary Data).
Nanocomposites were dialyzed and stored at 4 C in 10
mmol/L Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 6.0.
Doxorubicin hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared as
a 10 mg/mL solution in water and mixed overnight with
nanocomposites at a stoichiometric ratio of doxorubicin:nanocomposite surface sites of 0.35:1. UV-visible light spectroscopy
was carried out on a NanoDrop 1000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). Zeta potential was measured
on a Zetasizer Nano ZS Particle Size Analyzer (Malvern Instruments). DNCs were stored at 4 C and used within 1 week after
preparation. DNC concentrations are expressed throughout
the text as conjoined concentrations of doxorubicin and
nanocomposite components.
Cell culture conditions
All cell culture reagents were purchased from Mediatech
Inc., unless otherwise speciﬁed. A2780 and A2780/AD human
ovarian carcinoma cells were grown in RPMI-1640 medium
supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 U/mL
penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, 0.25 mg/mL amphotericin

each pH tested. The main
absorption peak of DNCs was
shaped similarly to doxorubicin at
pH 2, but DNCs at pH 6 and pH 4
displayed a red shift in absorption
maximum to 494 nm and the
presence of a right-handed
shoulder (arrows; approximately
533 nm), suggesting binding
between doxorubicin and
nanocomposites, whereas a shift in
absorption maximum back to 484

dissociation. B, IR spectra of KBr

Flow cytometry
Cells were collected and ﬁxed in a 1.85 wt% solution of
formaldehyde (diluted from 37 wt% solution, Sigma-Aldrich)
and stored in PBS at 4 C up to 24 hours prior to analysis.
Flow cytometry was carried out on a CyAn ADP LX Analyzer
(Beckman Coulter, Inc.). Respective excitation and emission
wavelengths (nm) used for doxorubicin, AlexaFluor488, and
AlexaFluor647 were as follows: 488, 575/25; 488, 530/40; and
635, 665/20. Data analysis was conducted using FCS Express
V3 software (De Novo Software).
Confocal microscopy
After treatment, cells were ﬁxed in 3.7 wt% formaldehyde
(Sigma-Aldrich). Nuclear DNA was stained with 4 mg/mL
Hoechst 33342, trihydrochloride, trihydrate (Invitrogen). Imaging was carried out on a Zeiss UV LSM 510 META (Carl Zeiss,
Inc.) laser scanning confocal microscope. Excitation and emission wavelengths (nm) used for Hoechst 33342, doxorubicin,
and AlexaFluor647 were as follows: 405, 420; 488, 560 to 615;
and 633, 657 to 679.
X-ray ﬂuorescence microscopy
Cells were grown and treated on silicon nitride (Si3N4)
windows. Detailed scans were done with 0.3  0.3 mm steps
and elemental distribution data were recorded, extracted, and
analyzed as described previously (10, 12, 14).

Fe3O4@TiO2 core-shell nanocomposites. Although catechol
molecules attach very strongly by bidentate polar covalent
bonds, other hydroxyl groups attach to the TiO2 surface by
looser bidentate or monodentate bonds (15–20, 24). The
doxorubicin molecule falls into the latter category. In an initial
set of experiments, we found that doxorubicin nanocomposite
binding is pH-dependent (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1A). IR
spectroscopy indicates that absorptive binding occurred without the b-hydroxyquinone moieties in the anthraquinone core
but rather involves other hydroxyl groups (Fig. 1B, Supplementary Table S1; refs. 25–29). Mild shifts in a few IR spectral
peaks and the lack of new peaks formed upon doxorubicin
adsorption indicate that no signiﬁcant structural changes
occurred to either doxorubicin or the nanocomposite (Fig.
1C, Supplementary Table S1). Binding with doxorubicin also
causes a shift in the zeta potential (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Doxorubicin separates from the nanocomposite as pH

decreases (Fig. 1A). Similarly, inside cells, as endosomes
become acidiﬁed, interaction between doxorubicin and the
TiO2 surface weakens, allowing doxorubicin to be displaced by
other ligands within the endosome.
We treated ovarian cancer cell lines with doxorubicin alone,
doxorubicin and nanocomposites added to the cell culture
media separately but simultaneously, or as DNCs, and imaged
the cells at 2 hours posttreatment by confocal ﬂuorescent
microscopy (Fig. 2A and B). The distribution of doxorubicin
showed a pattern that differed for cells exposed to free doxorubicin or DNCs. In the doxorubicin-sensitive cell line A2780
(Fig. 2A), free doxorubicin showed an exclusively nuclear
staining, whereas doxorubicin-treated A2780/AD showed no
doxorubicin staining at all (Fig. 2B). However, doxorubicin
ﬂuorescence signal after the DNC treatment showed a similar
pattern in both cell lines (Fig. 2A and B), although not the same
signal intensity. In both cases, doxorubicin ﬂuorescence was

was observed concurrent with increases in treatment concentration. Hypertonic treatment caused a decline in uptake, although not by more than 30%
to 40% of the overall uptake indicating that CME is only one of the possible endocytic mechanisms by which A2780 and A2780/AD cells take up DNCs. Y-axis

more intense in the cytoplasm than the nucleus; with a
nevertheless prominent nuclear staining.
To investigate whether whole DNCs or doxorubicin alone
migrated to the nucleus, we imaged similarly prepared cells by
X-ray ﬂuorescence microscopy (XFM; Fig. 3A and B). This
technique allows 2-dimensional elemental mapping of cells
for all elements between P and Zn in the periodic table
(10, 12, 14). Although doxorubicin is not visible by XFM,
nanocomposite components Ti and Fe can be identiﬁed and
quantiﬁed (Supplementary Fig. S2). To make the analysis easier
to interpret, we separated each image into 3 regions of interest:
cell nucleus (pink), cytoplasm (yellow), and the empty area
next to the cell (light blue). This technique showed that cells
treated with DNCs for 30 minutes or 2 hours retain the
nanocomposite component of DNCs in the cytoplasm only,
despite a strong doxorubicin presence in cell nuclei.
To further investigate uptake of doxorubicin delivered via
DNCs, we used increasing concentrations of doxorubicin or

DNCs (Fig. 4A). In A2780 cells, DNCs improved doxorubicin
accumulation only slightly; however, the difference in accumulation in the resistant A2780/AD cell line was 2.5- to 6.4-fold
depending on the concentration administered (Supplementary
Table S2).
To ensure that uptake of DNCs was driven by active endocytosis, we treated cells with doxorubicin or DNCs under a
nonphysiologic temperature of 4 C and evaluated doxorubicin
accumulation by ﬂow cytometry (Fig. 4B, Supplementary Table
S3). We found that uptake of doxorubicin alone or on DNCs was
inhibited under these conditions.
Our previous work suggested that cellular uptake of nanoparticles progresses by any one of the major endocytic mechanisms; of these, CME was a leading mechanism of uptake for
untargeted nanoparticles without any surface modiﬁcations
(11). In A2780 and A2780/AD cells, CME is the most prominent
endocytic mechanism (30). To investigate whether DNC
uptake was CME mediated, we exposed cells to hypertonic

conditions (Fig. 4C, Supplementary Table S4). Decrease of
doxorubicin signal was signiﬁcant in both cell lines, although
hypertonic treatment did not completely abolish DNC uptake.
CME uptake of DNCs cannot be ascribed to any particular
nanocomposite–receptor interaction but rather to a process
whereby uptake is facilitated by cell membrane remodeling
that takes place in any endocytic process (11). To investigate
whether we could boost the DNC uptake by cotreatment with
CME triggering ligands, we used transferrin, a ligand for
receptors processed via CME (30).
Abundant and biphasic uptake of transferrin is found in cell
lines expressing both TfR1 and 2 as is the case with A2780 and
A2780/AD cells (31, 32). Although both cell types took up high
levels of transferrin, overall higher uptake was found in the
A2780/AD cell line (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Table S5; ref. 31).
This uptake seemed nonsaturable, consistent with the literature for other TfR2-expressing cells (31). We proceeded to
image transferrin uptake by confocal microscopy (Supplementary Fig. S4) in the absence (Supplementary Fig. S4A) or
presence of nanocomposites (Supplementary Fig. S4B), doxorubicin (Supplementary Fig. S4C), or DNCs (Supplementary

Fig. S4D). The appearance of the transferrin distribution
pattern at 2 hours was the same regardless of the cotreatment
with any of the other reagents.
At this point, we focused on cotreatment of ovarian cancer
cells with DNCs and transferrin. An inspection of endocytic
vesicles carrying DNCs (Fig. 5A and B) at 30 minutes posttreatment showed partial overlap of doxorubicin and AlexaFluor647 (transferrin) ﬂuorescence signals. However, although
most of the transferrin signal overlaps with doxorubicin, the
opposite is not true; moreover, doxorubicin distribution is
more diffuse, showing a pattern less punctuate/vesicular than
that of transferrin. This difference is even more apparent at 2
hours. These ﬁndings are consistent with the dissociation of
doxorubicin from nanocomposites. Free doxorubicin as a small
molecule distributes through the cell and stains cell nuclei in a
pattern overlapping with Hoechst 33342 at 2 hours in A2780
cells. In A2780/AD cells, doxorubicin in the nucleus showed a
slightly more diffuse pattern and a more prominent presence
of doxorubicin-rich vesicle-like structures in nuclei and
cytoplasm. The origin and signiﬁcance of these structures
remain to be elucidated.

to A2780 cells, AlexaFluor647

complete overlap with doxorubicin,
although the vesicle distribution
pattern seems different than in
A2780 cells. In both types of cells,
all AlexaFluor647 signal is
colocalized with doxorubicin,
indicating that DNCs are not only
taken up in the same endocytic
vesicles as transferrin but remain in
them at this later time point.
Doxorubicin released from
nanocomposites follows the same
distribution pattern as in A2780
cells: staining is mostly nuclear,
with occasional doxorubicin-rich
"blebs" in the nucleus and
cytoplasm.

Nanocarriers Enhance Clathrin-Mediated Endocytosis

To test whether we could improve the uptake of DNCs
through coendocytosis with transferrin, we cotreated cells
with a steady level of one agent and an increasing concentration of the other. Exposure to a constant concentration of
DNCs and increasing concentrations of transferrin (Fig. 6A and
B, Supplementary Table S6) showed that DNC uptake was
constant and not assisted by transferrin treatment. However,
in all experiments with the reverse experimental setup, the
opposite was true. When a constant concentration of transferrin was administered in the presence of nanocomposites
(Supplementary Fig. S5A and Table S7), uptake of transferrin
increased; this uptake was much affected by treatment temperature. To differentiate between effects of nanocomposites
from effects of DNCs or doxorubicin alone, this experiment was
repeated (Supplementary Fig. S5B and Table S8) with the same
concentrations of nanocomposites, DNCs, or doxorubicin
alone. There were no signiﬁcant differences in transferrin
uptake between cells treated with transferrin alone or with
transferrin and doxorubicin, whereas cells treated with either
nanocomposites or DNCs showed a similar increase of transferrin uptake. Uptake differences between these 2 pairs of
samples were statistically signiﬁcant.
To investigate whether transferrin uptake at constant transferrin concentration and increasing DNC concentration
remains CME dependent, cells were treated under isotonic or
hypertonic conditions (Fig. 6C, Supplementary Table S9).
Hypertonic treatment decreased transferrin uptake to the
same background level, regardless of increasing DNC concentration. Isotonic treatment again led to increased transferrin
uptake with increasing DNC concentrations.

Discussion
Resistance to anthracycline antibiotics and other chemotherapeutics through cellular export is a frequent problem
in cancer treatment and numerous approaches have been
developed to overcome it. Several different variations on
"stealth" liposomal delivery were developed as well as
approaches for binding doxorubicin to copolymers or polymeric micelles (6). In some cases, these constructs deliver
doxorubicin to pgp-overexpressing cells in a 2-step fashion,
similar to the DNCs reported in this work. Nevertheless, DNCs
described here combine several unique advantages as doxorubicin delivery vectors: (i) superparamagnetic cores allow
nanocomposites to be used as MRI contrast agents; (ii) delivery
of doxorubicin into cells bypassing the pgp transporter followed by doxorubicin detachment and migration to cell nuclei;
(iii) capacity for permanent functionalization by catecholmodiﬁed molecules, for example, nucleic acids, peptides, or
targeting small molecules, which allows trageting or retention
of the nanocomposites in different subcellular compartments,
different cell types, or intercellular space; (iv) functionalization
with catechol-conjugated contrast agents such as gadoliniumbased MRI contrast or PET agents; ﬁnally, work shown
here suggests that (v) DNCs stimulate uptake of transferrin
and may be a convenient cotreatment with transferrin-targeted nanotherapeutics. Although many of these characteristics of nanocarriers were used in proof-of-principle work

Figure 6. Transferrin uptake is increased in the presence of DNCs. DNCs
at a constant concentration of 10 mmol/L/36 nmol/L were used to treat
A2780 (light gray) and A2780/AD (dark gray) cells, at increasing
concentrations of transferrin-AlexaFluor488 before analysis by ﬂow
cytometry. A, no increase in DNC uptake was observed in either cell line.
B, transferrin uptake increased relative to increasing transferrin treatment
concentrations. Y-axis is expressed in thousands for a product of median
doxorubicin ﬂuorescence within the gate for positive cells (in this
experiment, at a DNC concentration of 10 mmol/L/36 nmol/L all cells in
either cell line were positive for doxorubicin ﬂuorescence; Supplementary
Table S6). C, A2780 (white) and A2780/AD (black) cells were treated with
5 mg/mL transferrin-AlexaFluor647 and increasing concentrations of
DNCs under either isotonic (*, circles) or hypertonic (D, triangles)
conditions. AlexaFluor647 signal increased with increasing
concentrations of DNCs, indicating increased uptake of transferrin.
Hypertonic treatment signiﬁcantly inhibited transferrin uptake in both cell
lines, despite increasing concentrations of DNCs. Even under conditions
where increased DNC concentration led to increased transferrin uptake,
transferrin uptake remained dependent on CME. Y-axis is expressed
in thousands (Supplementary Table S9). Error bars represent SD
(n ¼ 3).

Arora et al.

(9, 12, 14, 33), it still remains to be determined how many of
these properties could be used at the same time, especially in
vivo, where the success of targeting can be expected to determine therapeutic ratio of nanocarrier treatments.
In this study, we have focused on the ovarian carcinoma cell
line A2780 and its doxorubicin-resistant pgp-overexpressing
analogue, A2780/AD (34). Nuclei of both cell types treated with
DNCs accumulated doxorubicin; at 30 minutes and 2 hours
posttreatment, both cell lines showed a vesicular doxorubicin
staining pattern unique to DNC-treated cells. The temperature
dependence of DNC uptake indicates involvement of endocytosis in this process. In general, nanoparticle uptake kinetics
and dynamics depend both on the nanomaterial and the
cell type–dependent factors regulating endocytosis (35, 36),
whereas doxorubicin normally enters cells through a passive
diffusion process (37). In a prior study, we found that nonfunctionalized TiO2 nanoparticles enter prostate cancer cells
using all 3 major endocytic mechanisms, most prominently
CME (11). Here, we show that CME again plays a very significant, although not exclusive role in entry of DNCs into A2780
and A2780/AD ovarian cancer cell lines. Endosomes created by
any one of the 3 major cellular uptake mechanisms often
undergo acidiﬁcation (38, 39); they may fuse with acidic
lysosomes or become acidiﬁed through activity of Hþ-ATPase
pump in the endosomal membrane, changing pH from 5 to 6
initially to below 5 in the lysosome (40). At this pH, bonds
between TiO2 and doxorubicin destabilize and the doxorubicin
can be replaced by other molecules with plentiful hydroxyl
groups. We also found that cotreatment of ovarian cancer cells
with a combination of DNCs (or doxorubicin-free nanocomposites) and ﬂuorescent transferrin increased transferrin
uptake but not nanocarrier uptake.
In addition to its role in trafﬁcking and homeostasis of iron,
transferrin and its receptors (TfR) play an important role in
cancer progression. TfR and TfR precursor expression were
implicated as biomarkers for early-stage ovarian cancer detection (41); TfR status has signiﬁcant diagnostic and staging
beneﬁts when combined with other biomarkers such as CA-125
(42). TfR1 has been shown to be expressed in almost all cell
types, but its upregulation in a variety of cancer cell lines makes
it an attractive molecular target for novel ovarian cancer
therapeutics (43). Increased TfR1 expression also correlates
with non–pgp-mediated resistance to doxorubicin, and a drug
used to overcome pgp resistance was also found to downregulate TfR1 expression in a drug-resistant cell line (44). TfR2
is normally found only in the liver and intestine, but it is
frequently expressed in tumor cell lines, including both cell
lines in this study (32), and has been associated with increased
cell survival in an in vivo model of Chinese hamster ovary
(CHO) tumor growth in mice (45).
Although it has been noted that transferrin distribution in
cells with TfR1 only occurs in tubulovesicular endosomes,
cells coexpressing TfR1 and 2 also accumulate transferrin in
multivesicular bodies (MVB) as well as within a reticular
system in the trans-Golgi network, a region where clathrin
localizes and receptor recycling is facilitated (31, 46–48). We
noticed that the transferrin distribution patterns in A2780
and A2780/AD cells show some differences, with both cell

776

lines accumulating transferrin in centralized cytoplasmic
tubular vesicular structures with an appearance of transGolgi sacs and/or MVBs but with a series of small vesicles
surrounding the nucleus and rich in transferrin in A2780/AD
cells only. The signiﬁcance of these differences in endosome
distribution pattern in the 2 ovarian cancer cell lines is
unknown at present. It is possible that these differences in
endosome processing additionally contribute to drug resistance in A2780/AD cells, beyond the survival advantage
conferred by pgp overexpression.
Microscopy and ﬂow cytometry showed increased transferrin uptake by nanocomposite-treated cells in this study. When
cotreatment was done, a signiﬁcant overlap in the doxorubicin
and ﬂuorescently labeled transferrin signals was found in
cytoplasm, in endocytic vesicles as well as in MVBs and
trans-Golgi apparatus. Nevertheless, we show that this
enhanced transferrin uptake remains completely dependent
on CME. Transferrin uptake by either cell line was completely
abolished by hypertonic treatment and this response was
preserved in nanocomposite-treated cells. Increased uptake
of transferrin at 2 hours implies that this change is not
dependent on changes in TfR expression but rather on modulation of CME and/or trans-Golgi activity. There have been
several ﬁndings in the recent literature suggesting that nanoparticle uptake can affect the cytoskeleton and focal adhesion
points (49, 50). Such cytoskeleton modulation could lead to
decreased exocytosis or otherwise alter vesicular trafﬁcking.
Therefore, it may be possible to use nanoparticles to increase
the uptake of other chemo- or nanotherapeutics that rely on
endocytosis. More speciﬁcally, delivery of nanotherapeutics
targeted by transferrin (43) could be increased by cotreatment
with DNCs.
