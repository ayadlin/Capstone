antiangiogenic effects (2). Although the anticancer activity of
nutlin-3 initially seemed to be limited to cells harboring wild-type
p53 (1), recent results revealed that nutlin-3 also exerted anticancer
effects in p53-negative and p53-mutant human tumor cells through
E2F1 binding to MDM2 (3, 4).
In this report, nutlin-3 was investigated in combination with
cytotoxic drugs in the pediatric cancer entities neuroblastoma and
rhabdomyosarcoma. In p53 wild-type neuroblastoma cells, nutlin-3
caused apoptosis and/or neuronal differentiation (5) and increased
sensitivity to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis (6). Information
about the activity of nutlin-3 in rhabdomyosarcoma is lacking.
Because nutlin-3 was shown to also exert anticancer effects that
are independent of MDM2 inhibition (3), p53-mutated cells were
included. Our most striking finding is that nutlin-3 sensitizes p53mutated multidrug-resistant cancer cells to chemotherapy by
interference with the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters
P-glycoprotein [P-gp; encoded by multidrug resistance gene 1
(MDR1/ABCB1)] and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP-1/
ABCC1).

Abstract
Murine double minute 2 (MDM2) negatively regulates the
activity of the tumor suppressor protein p53. Nutlin-3 is a
MDM2 inhibitor under preclinical investigation as nongenotoxic activator of the p53 pathway for cancer therapy. Here,
nutlin-3 was evaluated for its activity alone or in combination
with established chemotherapeutic drugs for antitumor action
in chemosensitive and chemoresistant neuroblastoma and
rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. Effects of nutlin-3 single
treatment were much more pronounced in p53 wild-type cell
lines (IC50s <3 Mmol/L) than in p53-mutated cell lines (IC50s
>17 Mmol/L). In sharp contrast to the expectations, nutlin-3
concentrations that did not affect viability of p53-mutated cell
lines strongly increased the efficacy of vincristine in p53mutated, P-glycoprotein (P-gp)–overexpressing cell lines
(decrease in IC50s 92- to 3,434-fold). Similar results were
obtained for other P-gp substrates. Moreover, nutlin-3
reduced efflux of rhodamine 123 and other fluorescence dyes
that are effluxed by P-gp. Investigation of Madin-Darby canine
kidney (MDCK) II cells stably transfected with plasmids
encoding for P-gp (MDCKII MDR1) or multidrug resistance
protein 1 (MRP-1, MDCKII MRP1) revealed that nutlin-3 not
only interferes with P-gp but also affects MRP-1–mediated
efflux. Kinetic studies and investigation of P-gp-ATPase
activity showed that nutlin-3 is likely to act as a P-gp
transport substrate. Examination of the nutlin-3 enantiomers
nutlin-3a and nutlin-3b revealed that, in contrast to MDM2inhibitory activity that is limited to nutlin-3a, both enantiomers similarly interfere with P-gp–mediated drug efflux. In
conclusion, nutlin-3–induced inhibition of P-gp and MRP-1
was discovered as a novel anticancer mechanism of the
substance in this report. [Cancer Res 2009;69(2):416–21]

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. The neuroblastoma cell lines UKF-NB-4 and UKF-NB-3 as well
as the UKF-NB-3 sublines adapted to doxorubicin (20 ng/mL; UKF-NB3rDOX20) or vincristine (10 ng/mL; UKF-NB-3rVCR10) were established as
described before (7, 8). Be(2)-C cells were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC). The alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell line UKFRhb-1 was established in our laboratory from a bone marrow metastasis.
The alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell line Rh30 was kindly provided by
Dr. P.J. Houghton (St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis, TN).
The vincristine-resistant rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines UKF-Rhb-1rVCR10
and Rh30rVCR10 were established by adaptation of UKF-Rhb-1 or Rh30 to
growth in the presence of vincristine 10 ng/mL.
P53 status and P-gp expression status of the cell lines UKF-NB-3, UKFNB-3rDOX20, UKF-NB-3rVCR10, UKF-NB-4, Be(2)-C, UKF-Rhb-1, UKF-Rhb1rVCR10, Rh30, and Rh30rVCR10 are shown in Table 1 (refs. 8–11; data for
UKF-Rhb-1, UKF-Rhb-1rVCR10 detected as described below).
The cell lines MDCKII MDR1 (12) and MDCKII MRP1 (12) and the
nontransfected control cell line MDCKII were kind gifts of Drs. P. Borst, M.
de Haas, and A.H. Schinkel (Nederlands Kanker Instituut, NKI, Amsterdam,
the Netherlands). P53-negative, P-gp–negative PC-3 prostate cancer cells
expressing low MRP-1 levels were received from ATCC. Adaptation of PC-3
to growth in the presence of vincristine 10 ng/mL resulted in a cell line that
shows MRP-1 overexpression but no P-gp expression (PC-3rVCR10; data not
shown).
All cell lines were propagated in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/mL penicillin, and
100 mg/mL streptomycin at 37jC.
Mutation analysis of p53. TP53 gene sequencing on cDNAs was
performed using the following four pairs of primers: TP53 Ex2-3-f

sequence analysis of genomic DNA as described previously (13). PCR was
performed as described before (8, 13). Each amplicon was sequenced
bidirectionally.
Drugs. Vincristine was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Doxorubicin was
from Cell Pharm. Nutlin-3, rhodamine 123, calcein-AM, and JC-1 were
purchased from Merck Biosciences.
Viability assay. Cell viability was tested by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye reduction assay after 96h incubation modified as described before (14).
Real-time PCR. Total RNA was isolated from cell cultures using the TRI
reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). Reverse transcription and real-time PCRs were
performed as described before (15). The following primer sequences
were used: 18s rRNA forward 5¶-GTGAAACTGCGAATGGCTCAT, 18s

Flow cytometry and investigation of efflux of ABC transporter
substrates. Antibodies directed against P-gp (Alexis Biochemicals via
AXXORA Deutschland), MRP-1, MRP-3, or breast cancer resistance protein
(BCRP/ABCG2, all three from Kamiya Biomedical Company) were used to
detect protein expression by flow cytometry.
To investigate ABC transporter–mediated substance efflux, cells were
incubated with rhodamine 123 (0.1 Amol/L, P-gp, MRPs), JC-1 (0.1 Amol/L, Pgp), or calcein-AM (2 Amol/L, MRPs) for 60 min. Then, cells were washed with
PBS and incubated for another 60 min to allow ABC transporter–mediated
drug efflux. Subsequently, cellular fluorescence was analyzed by flow
cytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson). Rhodamine 123 was detected
at the FL1 channel; JC-1 and calcein-AM were detected at the FL2 channel.

Results
Influence of nutlin-3 on cancer cell viability. Nutlin-3
sensitivity markedly differed between p53 wild-type (<3 Amol/L)
and p53 mutated cells (>17 Amol/L) after a 96-hour incubation
(Table 1; Fig. 1A). Moreover, nutlin-3 (20 Amol/L) treatment
induced expression of p53 target genes (p21, MDM2, GADD45) in
p53 wild-type cells but not in p53-mutated cells as shown for UKFNB-3, UKF-NB-3rVCR10, UKF-Rhb-1, and UKF-Rhb-1rVCR10 cells by
real-time PCR (Fig. 1B and C).
Efficacy of nutlin-3 in combination with anticancer drugs.
Nutlin-3 was already shown to increase the cytotoxic activity
of anticancer drugs (1). In UKF-NB-3 (p53-wild-type, P-gp-negative)
cells, nutlin-3 and vincristine induced additive cytotoxicity
(Fig. 2A). In sharp contrast to the results obtained with UKF-NB3, nutlin-3 concentrations that were nontoxic to UKF-NB-3rVCR10
cells (p53-mutated, high P-gp expression) dramatically increased
the vincristine sensitivity of these cells (Fig. 2A). The combination
of nutlin-3 and vincristine in concentrations that alone did not
affect UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cell viability caused complete destruction
of all UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cells (Fig. 2A and C). Similar results were
obtained for the comparison of UKF-Rhb-1 cells (p53 wild-type,

P-gp-negative) and UKF-Rhb-1rVCR10 (p53-mutated, high P-gp
expression) cells (Fig. 2B and C). Investigation of further cell lines
revealed that nontoxic or moderate toxic nutlin-3 concentrations
only slightly decreased the IC50 concentration of vincristine in p53
wild-type and P-gp–negative cells (<2-fold; UKF-NB-3, UKF-Rhb-1),
but massively decreased the IC50 of vincristine in p53-mutated and
P-gp–positive cells [92- to 3,434-fold; UKF-NB-3rVCR10, UKF-Rhb1rVCR10, UKF-NB-4; Be(2)-C; Table 1]. Moreover, nutlin-3 (10 Amol/L)
induced a 3-fold reduction in the IC50 for vincristine in p53mutated, P-gp negative Rh30 cells but caused a 721-fold reduction
in the IC50 for vincristine in the P-gp–expressing vincristineresistant subline Rh30rVCR10 (Table 1). These findings suggest that
nutlin-3 may interfere with P-gp–mediated vincristine efflux. In the
p53 wild-type and P-gp–overexpressing cell line UKF-NB-3rDOX20,
the IC50 for vincristine was decreased by 28.9-fold by nutlin-3
(1 Amol/L; Table 1). The reduced effect on vincristine sensitivity
compared with other P-gp–overexpressing cell lines may be
explained by the relatively low nutlin-3 concentration that had to
be applied due to the higher nutlin-3 sensitivity of this p53 wildtype cell line.
Moreover, UKF-NB-3rVCR10 or UKF-Rhb-1rVCR10 cells were
treated with nutlin-3 in combination with cytotoxic drugs with
different modes of action that are structurally unrelated to
vincristine. Nutlin-3 (20 Amol/L), a concentration that did not
significantly affect UKF-NB-3rVCR10 viability (96 F 8% cell
viability relative to untreated control), strongly sensitized UKFNB-3rVCR10 cells to the P-gp substrates doxorubicin, paclitaxel,
etoposide, mitomycin C, and actinomycin D but not to cisplatin
that is known not to be a P-gp substrate (Fig. 2D). Nutlin-3
(20 Amol/L) substantially decreased the IC50s of doxorubicin (IC50:
110 F 13 ng/mL; IC50 + nutlin-3: 9 F 1 ng/mL; fold decrease: 12.1),
paclitaxel (IC50: 51 F 5 ng/mL; IC50 + nutlin-3: 1.5 F 0.2 ng/mL; fold
decrease: 33.6), etoposide (IC50: 320 F 47 ng/mL; IC50 + nutlin-3:
16 F 2 ng/mL; fold decrease: 19.9), mitomycin C (IC50: 34 F
3 ng/mL; IC50 + nutlin-3: 4.6 F 0.7 ng/mL; fold decrease: 7.5), or
actinomycin D (IC50: 22.3 F 2.1 ng/mL; IC50 + nutlin-3: 0.34 F
0.03 ng/mL; fold decrease: 65.7) in UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cells but
did not significantly affect sensitivity to cisplatin (IC50: 178 F
24 ng/mL; IC50 + nutlin-3: 145 F 22 ng/mL; fold decrease: 1.2).
Similar results were obtained in UKF-Rhb-1rVCR10 cells (data
not shown).
To investigate the effects of nutlin-3 in P-gp–expressing and
non–P-gp-expressing cells that share the same genetic p53
background, p53-mutated, P-gp–negative Rh30 cells were transfected with lentiviral MDR1 vectors (see Supplementary Fig. S1).
Transfection with empty vectors did not change the sensitivity
of Rh30 (Rh30empty vector) cells to nutlin-3, vincristine, or the
combination of vincristine and nutlin-3 (Table 1). Rh30 cells
transfected with MDR1 (Rh30MDR1) showed decreased sensitivity
to vincristine that was reverted by addition of nutlin-3.
Influence of nutlin-3 on the ABC transporter–mediated
efflux of fluorescence substrates. The fluorescent P-gp
substrate rhodamine 123 was used to investigate the influence
of nutlin-3 on P-gp–mediated substance efflux. Rhodamine 123
(0.1 Amol/L) fluorescence was detected in P-gp–negative UKFNB-3 cells but not in P-gp–overexpressing UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cells
(Fig. 3A). Nutlin-3 (20 Amol/L) treatment induced strong
accumulation of rhodamine 123 in UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cells (25fold increase; Fig. 3A). In contrast, nutlin-3 (20 Amol/L)
increased rhodamine 123 accumulation in UKF-NB-3 cells to a
much lesser extent (1.7-fold increase; Fig. 3A). Noteworthy,

nutlin-3–induced effects on rhodamine 123 accumulation were
similar to those induced by verapamil that is known to inhibit
P-gp being a P-gp substrate. Moreover, rhodamine 123 efflux
inhibition by nutlin-3 occurred in a concentration-dependent

0.625 Amol/L anymore (data not shown). Similar results were
obtained by the use of the fluorescence dye calcein-AM in MDCKII
MRP1 cells (data not shown). To investigate the influence of nutlin3 on MRP-1 in a second model, nutlin-3 was examined in PC3rVCR10, the vincristine-resistant subline of the p53-negative PC-3
cell line, showing high MRP-1 expression but no P-gp expression. In
PC-3rVCR10 cells, nutlin-3 (20 Amol/L) decreased the IC50 value
for vincristine from 45.78 F 3.87 ng/mL to 15.45 F 2.21 ng/mL.
The MRP inhibitor MK571 (20 Amol/L) reduced it to 11.57 F
0.45 ng/mL. Moreover, nutlin-3 caused calcein-AM accumulation
similarly to the MRP inhibitor MK571 (20 Amol/L) in PC-3rVCR10
cells (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Nutlin-3 is transported by P-gp. The question if nutlin-3 may
act as direct inhibitor of P-gp function or as P-gp substrate was
addressed by two different approaches. First, the time kinetics of
nutlin-3–mediated inhibition of rhodamine 123 efflux was investigated in UKF-NB-3rVCR10 and MDCKII MDR1 cells. Whereas P-gp
inhibitors commonly show prolonged activity even after a washingout period, the activity of P-gp substrates rapidly declines after
substance removal (19, 20). To examine this, cells were incubated
with rhodamine 123 in the presence of nutlin-3 (20 Amol/L) or
verapamil (5 Ag/mL), which is a P-gp substrate, for 60 minutes.
Then, cells were washed and rhodamine 123 fluorescence was
detected after 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes. Results indicated that
rhodamine 123 fluorescence rapidly decreases after wash-out of
nutlin-3 or verapamil (Fig. 3D).

manner in UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cells (Fig. 3B). Investigation of the
P-gp substrate JC-1 that is structurally not related to rhodamine
123 resulted in similar results: accumulation in UKF-NB-3 cells
but not in UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cells and strong inhibition of JC-1
efflux by nutlin-3 in UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cells (data not shown).
MRP-1 is another family member of the ABC transporters that
was shown to be involved in cancer cell chemoresistance (17, 18).
P-gp plays a dominant role between the ABC transporters in UKFNB-3rVCR10 cells. No significant overexpression of MRP-3 or BCRP
could be detected. Moreover, MRP-specific (MK571) or BCRPspecific ( fumitremorgin C) inhibitors did not significantly affect
efflux of different fluorescence substrates from UKF-NB-3rVCR10
cells (data not shown). Accumulation of rhodamine 123 that is a
substrate of P-gp and MRP-1 was measured in MDCKII cells stably
overexpressing P-gp (MDCKII MDR1) or MRP-1 (MDCKII MRP1)
with or without nutlin-3 treatment. Results indicated decreased
rhodamine 123 accumulation in MDCKII MDR1 and in MDCKII
MRP-1 cells. Moreover, nutlin-3 caused strong accumulation of

verapamil (5 Ag/mL) showed comparable effects like nutlin-3
in MDCKII MDR1 cells and the specific MRP inhibitor MK571
(20 Amol/L) showed comparable effects like nutlin-3 in MDCKII
MRP1 cells (data not shown). Nutlin-3 inhibited rhodamine 123
efflux from MDCKII MDR1 or MDCKII MRP1 cells in a
concentration-dependent manner, showing still weak effects in a
concentration of 1.25 Amol/L but no effect in a concentration of

Discussion

To further investigate if a substance may inhibit P-gp or act as
P-gp substrate, the P-gp ATPase activity can be determined (19,
20). The P-gp ATPase activity is often stimulated in the presence
of transported substrates such as verapamil. Determination of the
P-gp ATPase activity revealed that nutlin-3 (20 Amol/L) and
verapamil (5 Ag/mL) stimulated P-gp ATPase activity to a similar
extent and no antagonism between verapamil and nutlin-3 in
stimulation of P-gp ATPase activity (Fig. 3D). Taken together,
these results suggest that nutlin-3 acts as a P-gp transport
substrate.
Influence of the nutlin-3 enantiomers nutlin-3a and nutlin3b on P-gp. To investigate if the nutlin-3 enantiomers nutlin-3a
and nutlin-3b exert differential effects on P-gp, their influence was
tested on UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cell viability in combination with
vincristine (Supplementary Table S1), on rhodamine 123 efflux in
UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cells, and on P-gp ATPase activity (Supplementary Fig. S4). Results revealed that both enantiomers showed
similar effects on P-gp function.

In this report, the MDM2 inhibitor nutlin-3 was investigated
alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs in a panel of
chemosensitive and chemoresistant neuroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. In concordance with previous studies (5),
nutlin-3 was much more effective in p53 wild-type than in p53mutated neuroblastoma cells. Moreover, we could show that the
anticancer activity of nutlin-3 also includes p53 wild-type
rhabdomyosarcoma cells. A previous report had shown that
nutlin-3 sensitizes p53 wild-type neuroblastoma cells to chemotherapy-induced cell death (6). We found that nutlin-3 interferes
with P-gp function being a P-gp substrate. Nontoxic nutlin-3
concentrations strongly decreased the IC50 for vincristine (and
other P-gp substrates structurally nonrelated to vincristine) in
different p53-mutated, P-gp–expressing cell lines (92- to 3,434-fold).
In addition to P-gp, other ABC transporters may play a role in
cancer cell chemoresistance (17, 18). Our results indicate that
nutlin-3 also interferes with MRP-1 activity. Systematic analysis of

Reversal of P-gp–Mediated Resistance by Nutlin-3

Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest

the influence of nutlin-3 on the activity of different ABC
transporters is warranted. Notably, nutlin-3 is a racemate with
nutlin-3a being the enantiomer that inhibits MDM2, whereas
nutlin-3b does not (1). Both enantiomers similarly interfere with Pgp, indicating that the underlying structure-activity relationships
differ from those defined for MDM2 inhibition.
In conclusion, our data show that nutlin-3 interferes with Pgp– or MRP-1–mediated drug efflux in multidrug-resistant cancer
cells, representing a novel anticancer mechanism of this
substance. This newly discovered activity requires further
consideration during the development of this drug. Moreover,
previous findings about synergisms between nutlin-3 and
cytotoxic drugs may be reanalyzed concerning the role of ABC
transporters. Because overexpression of ABC transporters and
namely P-gp belongs to the most important chemoresistance
mechanisms, nutlin-3 may be a new lead structure for the design
of ABC transporter inhibitors.
