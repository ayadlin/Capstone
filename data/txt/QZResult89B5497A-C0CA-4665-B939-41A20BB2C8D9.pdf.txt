ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of global cancer mortality.
Recent studies have proposed several gene signatures to predict CRC prognosis, but
none of those have proven reliable for predicting prognosis in clinical practice yet
due to poor reproducibility and molecular heterogeneity. Here, we have established a
prognostic signature of 113 probe sets (CRC-113) that include potential biomarkers
and reflect the biological and clinical characteristics. Robustness and accuracy were
significantly validated in external data sets from 19 centers in five countries. In
multivariate analysis, CRC-113 gene signature showed a stronger prognostic value
for survival and disease recurrence in CRC patients than current clinicopathological
risk factors and molecular alterations. We also demonstrated that the CRC-113 gene
signature reflected both genetic and epigenetic molecular heterogeneity in CRC
patients. Furthermore, incorporation of the CRC-113 gene signature into a clinical
context and molecular markers further refined the selection of the CRC patients
who might benefit from postoperative chemotherapy. Conclusively, CRC-113 gene
signature provides new possibilities for improving prognostic models and personalized
therapeutic strategies.

localized CRC, because CRC is a highly heterogeneous
disease [6]. Practically, 10–20% of patients with stage II
CRC, and 30–40% of those with stage III CRC develop
recurrence [7]. Thus, molecular markers have extensively
been investigated for CRC characterization and prognosis.
Microsatellite instability (MSI), caused by defective
function of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system,
has reproducibly been found to constitute a significant
prognostic factor in early CRC in both a meta-analysis
and prospective trials [8–10]. KRAS is also a reliable
predictive marker in EGFR-targeted therapies of advanced
CRC [11, 12]. Other DNA alterations, chromosomal
instability (CIN), CpG island methylator phenotype

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes
of morbidity and mortality in the world. It is the third most
common cause of death worldwide, accounting for 8%
of all cancer-related deaths [1–3]. The American Joint
Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system is the current
standard for determining patient prognosis [4]. Usually,
stage II and stage III patients at risk of locoregional or
distant relapse are designated for chemotherapy while
stage I patients are cured by surgery only [5]. However,
pathological staging fails to accurately predict recurrence
in many patients undergoing curative surgery for

(CIMP), p53 and BRAF should be further defined for
reproducible molecular classification [11, 12].
Gene expression profiling has shown great promise
in predicting prognosis of individual patients in diverse
cancers. Several gene signatures have thus been developed
to classify various prognostic groups beyond the CRC
clinicopathological features. However, no signature has
been clinically reliable yet. This poor reproducibility
is attributed to the heterogeneity that develops in CRC
through the integration of genetic and epigenetic features
[13–16]. Therefore, it is critically required to establish a
prognostic gene signature that would reflect the molecular
heterogeneity of CRC in both genetic and epigenetic
aspects, and would be used clinically to accurately predict
recurrence risk and guide decisions of adjuvant therapy
for the patients.
In this study, we established a novel prognostic gene
signature to distinguish low and high risk patients using
a gene expression profiling technique in six independent
data sets from 19 centers in five countries. Then,
we assessed the associations between the gene signature,
clinicopathological factors and molecular alterations.
We further investigated whether the new gene signature
would help to develop adjuvant therapeutic strategies for
stage III CRC patients. Finally, we attempted to provide
possibilities for improving prognostic models of CRC
heterogeneous aspects.

coefficient indicates that the increased expression
contributes to the high value for the CRC-113 gene
signature value and thus a higher risk for poor survival.
The 113 probe sets corresponded to 77 annotated genes
(24 genes represented by more than one probe set),
one expressed sequence tag clone, and two probe sets
have no annotation (Supplementary Table S1). The
resultant expression patterns of CRC-113 gene signature
presented the low and high risk patient groups into two
clusters (Supplementary Figure S1). Several independent
studies previously proposed different gene signatures
to identify CRC subtypes for predicting prognosis. We
thus investigated whether the genes in CRC-113 gene
signature were overlapped with those in the reported
signatures: 21 genes (30 probes), 36 genes (53 probes)
and 17 genes (17 probes) were in common with those
published in the validation data sets from Jorrisen, et al.
(GSE14333) [21], De Sousa E Melo, et al. (GSE33113)
[22], Marisa, et al. (GSE39582) [23], respectively, and
13 genes (17 probes) in Oh, et al. [24]. However, there
was no common probe in the probe sets from another
study of De Sousa E Melo, et al. [25].

CRC-113 gene signature and clinical relevance
To investigate the association between the CRC-113
gene signature classifier and clinicopathological
characteristics, including gender, age at diagnosis,
AJCC disease stage, grade, race and each follow-up
time, we performed Chi-square (χ2) test (Table 1).
The AJCC stage (p = 8.45e-03) and patient follow-up
times (DFS, p = 6.43e-04; OS, p = 1.79e-04; DSS,
p = 3.74e-04, respectively) were significantly correlated
to our classification, while the others were not associated.
To compare the prognostic value of our CRC-113 gene
signature with other prognostic covariates, we performed
univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis
using the discovery data set (Table 2). In univariate
analysis, AJCC stage was significantly associated
with DFS (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.4–3.1, p = 7.24e-04),
OS (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3–2.6, p = 1.82e-03) and DSS
(HR 2.1, 95% Cl 1.3–3.8, p = 2.77e-03). The AJCC stage
remained significantly associated with patient prognosis
in DFS (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2–2.9, p = 5.29e-03), OS
(HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2–2.9, p = 5.38e-03) and DSS
(HR 2.3, 95% Cl 1.2–4.2, p = 0.011) in multivariate
analysis. Notably, CRC-113 gene signature showed
stronger prognostic ability than CRC stage: DFS
(HR 3.5, 95% CI 1.7–7.5, p = 1.08e-03), OS (HR 2.9,
95% CI 1.5–5.7, p = 1.55e-03), and DSS (HR 5.0, 95%
CI 1.9–13.2, p = 1.08e-03) in univariate analysis, and DFS
(HR 3.1, 95% CI 1.6–6.3, p = 1.18e-03), OS (HR 2.9, 95%
CI 1.5–5.6, p = 2.01e-03), DSS (HR 5.4, 95% CI 2.0–14.8,
p  = 1.10e-03) in multivariate analysis. No significant
difference was obtained in other clinical variables.

RESULTS
CRC-113 gene signature
In order to generate a molecular classifier
that distinguishes low and high risk patients, gene
expression profilings were analyzed in relation to
survival data. We used the GSE17538 data set as a
discovery data set [17, 18]. After filtering for probe set
intensity, 3531 probe sets were analyzed in a univariate
Cox regression analysis with DFS as the survival end
point, as discussed previously [19, 20]. As a result,
the gene signature with 113 probe sets was developed,
and shown to be associated with DFS (false discovery
rate of <10%). This model was termed the CRC-113
gene signature. A flow chart of the procedure used to
generate the gene signature was provided (Figure 1A).
Prognostic index for each patient was calculated based
on the CRC-113 gene signature (Figure 1B). The
patients were classified into high (n = 73) and low
(n = 72) risk groups by risk relied on their prognostic
index. Survival differences between predicted low and
high risk outcome groups were evaluated with KaplanMeier survival curves for each follow-up time: DFS
(p = 5.00e-04; Figure 1C), OS (p = 1.59e-04; Figure 1D),
and DSS (p = 4.49e-05; Figure 1E) of patients classified
by CRC-113 gene signature. A positive weighting

respectively, Supplementary Table S4). CRC-113
gene signature significantly classified patients into low
and high risk groups in three independent validation
data sets on both univariate and multivariate analyses
(Supplementary Table S5–S7). In multivariate analyses,
CRC-113 gene signature showed prognostic significance
for risk in these three different validation data sets: DFS
of GSE14333 (HR 2.2, p = 9.27e-03, Supplementary
Table S5), RFS of GSE33113 (HR 3.2, p = 0.014,
Supplementary Table S6) and RFS of GSE39582
(HR 1.7, p = 8.37e-04, Supplementary Table S7). KaplanMeier plots indicated significant differences in these three
validation data sets: GSE14333 (p = 2.0e-04, Figure 2B),
GSE33113 (p = 6.80e-03, Figure 2C) and GSE39582

of CRC-113 gene signature for each validation data
set presented the low and high risk patient groups into

GSE14333 validation data set, CRC-113 gene signature
distinguished 139 (61.5%) and 87 (38.5%) patients
as the low and high risk groups, respectively. The
Dukes’ stage and the DFS were significantly correlated
to our classification (p = 2.98e-59 and p = 4.57e-09,

validation data set, 66 (66.7%) and 30 (33.3%) patients
were predicted as low and high risk groups, respectively.
Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was significantly
correlated to our classification (p = 0.011, Supplementary
Table S3). In the GSE39582 validation data set, 331

low and high risk groups, respectively. AJCC stage and

Validation of CRC-113 gene signature in
colorectal cancer and normal tissue

CRC patients in stage II and III frequently develop
recurrence after treatment, while patients in stage I are
usually cured by surgery alone [5]. Thus, we investigated
whether CRC-113 gene signature could suitably classify
patients with stage II and/or III into two risk groups in
discovery and/or validation data sets. The discovery data
set included patients with survival information in stage II
(n = 55) and III (n = 56), and the validation data sets
comprise patients with stage II (n = 444) or III (n = 292).
All patients were labeled according to Dukes’ classification
system in the GSE14333 validation data set. Thus, we
categorized patients with Dukes’ B and C stages to AJCC
stage II and III, respectively. In all data sets, stage II
patients showed a good outcome, whereas stage III patients
had a relative poor outcome (80.3% and 63.5% in 5-year
DFS, respectively). As expected, CRC-113 gene signature
significantly stratified the stage II and/or III patients into low
and high risk groups (Figure 3). The patients with high risk
(n = 303, 41.2%) showed poorer outcomes than those with
low risk (n = 433, 59.8%) in stage II and/or III (p = 8.02e-04
for stage II, p = 0.034 for stage III and p = 4.54e-05 for stage
II and III, respectively, Figure 3A–3C). Additionally, with
the discovery data set, we also observed similar results in
stage II (p = 1.38e-04), stage III (p = 0.012), and stage II and
III (p = 1.13e-06) (Supplementary Figure S4A–S4C). This
CRC-113 gene signature could clearly classify patients in
stage I with or without patients from the discovery data set
(p = 0.033 and p = 7.82e-03, respectively, Supplementary
Figure S4D and S4E), but not in stage IV patients even
including patients from discovery data set (Supplementary
Figure S4F).

with three distinct pathways of genetic instability: MMR,
CIMP and CIN [29]. The MMR dysfunction causes MSI
which is the condition of genetic hypermutability. The
CIMP inactivates tumor suppressor genes via genome
hypermethylation. The CIMP is also relevant to BRAF
mutation [30]. The CIN phenotype results from the
accumulation of numerical or structural chromosomal
abnormalities (aneuploidy) [31], and is strongly related
to KRAS and p53 mutations [32]. However, it still
remains undefined to evaluate the heterogeneity of CRC.
Based on the information of these genetic and epigenetic
alterations presented in the GSE39582 data set, MMR
and KRAS could classify the patients into low and high
risk groups (p = 9.26e-04 and p = 0.023, respectively,
Supplementary Figure S5A and S6A). However, the
other DNA alterations did not contribute to stratification
of patients into two prognostic risk groups (CIN and
CIMP, Supplementary Figure S5D and S5G; p53 and
BRAF, Supplementary Figure S6D and S6G). We thus
investigated whether the CRC-113 gene signature could
further stratify the CRC patients associated with the
molecular subtypes. We first incorporated CRC-113 gene
signature with each of these DNA alteration factors. In
association analysis using χ2 test, the CRC-113 gene
signature risk was remarkably interrelated with each
DNA alteration: MMR (p = 1.33e-05, Figure 4A), CIN
(p = 0.035, Figure 4B), CIMP (p = 0.045, Figure 4C),
KRAS (p = 1.91e-03, Figure 4D) and p53 status
(p = 3.88e-04, Figure 4E), except for BRAF status
(p = 0.053, Figure 4F). The high risk patients with pMMR
showed the highest risk outcome among the four subgroups. The high risk patients with KRAS wild type (WT)
presented similar poor-prognostic outcomes compared to
the patients with KRAS mutant (M). Moreover, CRC-113
gene signature significantly exhibited further hierarchical
discrimination in the status of DNA alterations: MMR
proficient (pMMR, p = 6.34e-04) and MMR deficient
(dMMR, p = 0.05) (Supplementary Figure S5B and S5C);
CIN-high (p = 5.24e-03) and CIMP-low (p = 0.032)
(Supplementary Figure S5F and S5H), KRAS WT
(p = 1.32e-03, Supplementary Figure S6B), p53 M
(p = 1.05e-03, Supplementary Figure S6F), and BRAF
WT (p = 0.024, Supplementary Figure S6H). Patients
with pMMR frequently presented CIMP-low and CINhigh phenotypes (78.4%, n = 269 of 343), whereas there
was no significant relationship in dMMR, CIMP and
CIN. Additionally, KRAS, BRAF and p53 mutations did
not show any interrelationship. The association between
each DNA alteration and CRC-113 gene signature was
summarized in Supplementary Table S8.

Association of CRC-113 gene signature with
molecular pathways and mutations

Association of CRC-113 gene signature with
advantage of adjuvant chemotherapy

Traditional CRC development involves stepwise
accumulation of genetic alterations [28], which is
substantially more complex than that originally envisioned

Adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III CRC has
been shown to improve survival rate, and is currently
recommended as standard therapy [33, 34]. Thus, in order

To further evaluate whether there was a significant
difference between CRC tissues and normal tissues
based on gene expression of CRC-113 gene signature,
we analyzed two independent data sets, GSE21510 [26]
and GSE41328 [27], for which there was no available
survival information on public database. As shown in
results, the prognostic indices of normal subjects were
evidently lower than those of colorectal cancer patients
in GSE21510 (p = 3.11e-03, Figure 2F) and GSE41328
(p = 1.46e-03, Figure 2G) data sets, respectively. None
of the tissue samples from non-colorectal cancer patients
were predicted as indicating high risk.

with patients in stage III of GSE14333 and GSE39582.
In the GSE14333 validation data set, the patients in
stage C received standard adjuvant chemotherapy (either
single agent 5-fluouracil/capecitabine or 5-fluouracil
and oxaliplatin). In the GSE39582 validation data
set, the stage III patients received standard adjuvant
chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin.
Chemotherapy itself showed therapeutic benefit for
DFS in the GSE14333 validation data set (p = 0.037,
Supplementary Figure S7A), but did not give advantage
for recurrence in the GSE39582 validation data set
(p = 0.554, Supplementary Figure S7B). By incorporating
CRC-113 gene signature into chemotherapy information,
the high risk patients with stage III of GSE14333
validation data set were shown to obtain the benefit
compared to patients without adjuvant chemotherapy
(p = 0.022, Figure 5A). In contrast, low risk patients
with stage III of the GSE14333 validation data set
did not have significant difference in chemotherapy
treatment (p = 0.445, Figure 5B). Interestingly, the
stage III patients in both low and high risk groups of
GSE39582 validation data set did not benefit from
chemotherapy (Supplementary Figure S7C and S7D).
We also applied CRC-113 gene signature to other stages;
however, all the patients of these stages did not achieve
benefit with chemotherapy treatment (data not shown).
Additionally, we investigated whether incorporation of
CRC-113 gene signature into DNA alterations could give
chemotherapeutical benefit to stage  III patients of the
GSE39582 validation data set. Without incorporation of
CRC-113 gene signature, only the patients with KRAS
M  among stage III had chemotherapeutical benefit
(p = 0.018, Supplementary Figure S7E). However, with
incorporation of the CRC-113 gene signature, high
risk patients had no benefit in adjuvant chemotherapy
(p  = 0.719, Figure 5C), whereas low risk patients
receiving adjuvant chemotherapy showed better prognosis
(p = 2.49e-04, Figure 5D).

the good-prognosis (‘Others’: C1, C2, C3 and C5),
corresponding with the prognostic difference. They
reported that the C4 and C6 subtypes were enriched
for stem cell-like signature from both of a mouse
intestinal stem cell signature [35] and a human colon
top and bottom crypt signature [36], and a normallike signature from a breast cancer signature [37],
respectively. Especially, 1108 probe sets were used for
subtype-discrimination, which shared 53 probe sets with
CRC-113 gene signature (Supplementary Table S1).
Thus, we investigated the association between CRC-113
gene signature and these two distinct prognostic groups.
After incorporation of CRC-113 gene signature, our
signature risk was significantly associated with the
binary classification in all stages (p = 1.40e-06, χ2-test,
Figure 6A), and a similar result was found in the analysis
of the stage II and III combined group (p = 1.40e-04,
χ2-test, Figure 6B). Here, we identified the poorest
prognostic sub-group, C4C6-high, from the ‘C4C6’
group. Our classifier further stratified this ‘C4C6’ group
into low and high risk groups in all stages (p = 0.014,
Figure 6C), stage II and III (p = 0.014, Figure 6D),
while the ‘Others’ group was not further classified
(data not shown). Among the patients of ‘C4′ (n = 59)
and ‘C6’ (n = 60), 58 and 24 patients (n = 82, 68.9%),
respectively, belonged to high risk patients of CRC-113
gene signature.

Gene ontology term enrichment analysis and
visualization of CRC-113 gene signature
To identify the biological function of the genes in the
CRC-113 gene signature, we performed GO enrichment
analysis in DAVID, and then identified 42 significant GO
terms (biological process), including biological adhesion,
cell adhesion, cell motility, extracellular matrix organization
and response to wounding. The false discovery rates
(FDRs) were estimated using the procedure of Benjamini
(p < 0.05, Supplementary Table S9). GO term redundancy
was removed and visualized in the semantic space via
REViGO, representing functional clusters (Supplementary
Figure S8).

Incorporation of CRC-113 gene signature into a
published molecular subtype classifier

Protein network in CRC-113 gene signature

Marisa, et al (GSE39582 validation data set) [23]
previously suggested six molecular subtypes for the
predicting prognosis of CRC recurrence. These subtypes
were associated with distinct clinicopathological
characteristics, molecular mutations, gene expression
signature and signaling pathways. The six subtypes were
termed according to their biological characteristics as
follows: C1 (CINImmuneDown), C2 (dMMR), C3 (KRASm:
KRAS-mutant), C4 (CSC: cancer stem cell), C5
(CINWntUp) and C6 (CINnormL The subtypes were finally
categorized by two distinct groups: a poor-prognosis
group (‘C4C6′: C4 and C6), and all other subtypes as

To verify potential protein interactions of 77 genes
in the CRC-113 gene signature, we generated a molecular
network by introducing these 77 genes into STRING, a
molecular tool that was able to elaborate physical and
functional associations among proteins. As shown in
results, 69 out of 77 genes were closely connected in a
single network (Supplementary Figure S9).

limited due to molecular heterogeneity. Thus, it is
necessary to correctly identify individual recurrence
risk and adjuvant chemotherapeutical benefit. Several
studies have previously shown that the gene signatures
are capable of prognosticating in CRC patients, but no
gene signature has been clinically useful yet. To address
this issue, we established a CRC-113 gene signature
which could be valuable to predict disease recurrence
and adjuvant chemotherapy effect by using a large patient

sample size with a long follow-up time and the same
platform. We applied the supervised method and avoided
model overfitting by LOOCV. The robustness of the
CRC-113 gene signature was supported by the high
sensitivity (0.972) and specificity (0.932) values, and the
reproducibility through significant association between
the predicted outcome and patient prognosis in validation
data sets. Independence of CRC-113 gene signature as
a prognostic marker was reinforced by the results using

various approaches. By incorporating DNA alterations,
we found that the CRC-113 gene signature which could
further stratify patients into prognostic subdivisions has
important clinical value to help guide judicious treatment
decisions. Additionally, subgroup analysis of patients
with stage III cancer only indicated that CRC-113 gene
signature might predict which patients would benefit from
adjuvant chemotherapy for DFS. Finally, we demonstrated
that CRC-113 provides a new insight to elucidate CRC
heterogeneity.

The current AJCC pathological staging criteria
cannot accurately predict patient survival. Approximately
25% of CRC patients present metastatic features, and
pathological staging fails to correctly predict recurrence
in many patients undergoing curative surgery for CRC
due to the heterogeneity [38, 39]. We evidently showed
that the CRC-113 gene signature supplies the lack of
pathological staging via further stratification of patients
into significant low and high risk groups in each CRC
stage. Unfortunately, CRC-113 gene signature was not

correlated to demographic disparities such as age, gender
and ethnicity for prognosis prediction. Actually, these
factors have been considered to be the risk factors in CRC
[40, 41]. For example, incidence or mortality rates of CRC
are statistically highest in black men and women, followed
by white, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, and American
Indian/Alaska Native people [41]. At present, it remains to
be answered why our gene signature does not reflect the
demographic disparities.
In colorectal carcinogenesis, there are three distinct
genetic pathways: MSI, CIMP and CIN [29]. However, the
patients evaluated by these molecular markers still differ
remarkably in prognosis and therapeutic responses [42]. We
found that CRC-113 gene signature further stratified patients
in combination with MMR status; high risk patients with
pMMR presented the poorest prognosis. It also stratified
CIMP-Low or CIN-High patients. Moreover, CRC-113
gene signature further stratified the patients with KRAS
and BRAF WTs, and p53 M. Therefore, we argue that
CRC-113 gene signature can overcome limitations of the
conventional molecular markers via further stratification
in CRC predicting prognosis. Interestingly, the number
of the high risk group (n = 128, 59.8%) was relatively
larger than that of the low risk group (n = 86, 40.2%) in
patients with KRAS M, while the ratio was inclinable to
be opposite in patients with KRAS WT (n = 133, 41.3%
for high risk group; n = 198, 58.7% for low risk group).
This result seemed reasonable for the relationship between
KRAS status and risk classification, although the sample
size was not sufficient to firmly conclude this observation.
Meanwhile, poor-prognostic outcomes were shown in
both groups of low risk with KRAS M and high risk with
KRAS WT.
The identification of individual patients in need of
optimized adjuvant therapy still remains as a major clinical
concern. In both internal and combined-validation data
sets, the CRC-113 gene signature clearly stratified stage III
CRC patients into low and high risk groups. Subgroup
analysis of patients with available data revealed that
adjuvant chemotherapy improved DFS in high risk patients
with stage III. Although CRC-113 gene signature could
not predict delayed relapse after adjuvant chemotherapy,
when combined with KRAS M, it helped to define stage III
patients with delayed relapse. Our signature also showed
that a subgroup of patients with low risk and KRAS
M were more sensitive to chemotherapy. Additionally, we
found that a subgroup of patients with high risk and KRAS
M did not present adjuvant chemotherapeutical advantage.
The CRC-113 gene signature might imply the potential
benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage III
CRC, although we agree that it would not be enough to
make a strong conclusion for the predictive power due to
the small number of patients used in these analyses.
In the comparative analysis between our gene
signature and the six molecular subtypes (C1-C6) in
the recent study of Marisa, et al [23], the C4 and C6
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

patients (‘C4C6’) were classified as a poorer-outcome
group than the other group patients. The ‘C4C6’
subtypes presented down-regulation of cell growth and
death pathways, and up-regulation of the epithelial–
mesenchymal transition pathway. Our CRC-113 gene
signature further stratified ‘C4C6’ patients into low
and high risk groups, of which high risk patients
in ‘C4C6’ belonged to the poorest subtype group.
Especially, all of the C4 patients, except for one,
were evaluated as high risk patients by CRC-113
gene signature. Interestingly, 36 genes in CRC-113
gene signature were overlapped with their subtypediscrimination probe sets that they reported [23].
The majority of genes in CRC-113 gene signature
have critical roles in cell proliferation, angiogenesis,
migration, invasion and metastasis of CRC. These genes
include APOE [43], Bcat1 [44], CAV2 [45], COL1A1
[46], COL3A1 [47], COL5A2 and COL11A1 [48],
COL10A1 [49], CTGF [50], FN1 [51, 52], HOPX [53],
HOXC6 [54], LOX [55], NRP-1 [56], SERPINE1 [57],
THBS2 [58], TM4SF1 [59], Versican [60], WIST1
[61] and WNT5A [62]. Also, CRC-113 gene signature
includes a number of hypoxia and inflammation-related
genes in various cancer such as AKAP12 [63], ANXA1
[64, 65], CCL11 [66], CTGF [67], FABP4 [68], FN1
[69], IGFBP3 [70], LOX [71], NOX4 [72, 73], NRP1
[74], OLR1 [75], SLC2A3 [76] and WNT5A [77],
indicating that hypoxia and inflammation, which are two
inseparable hallmarks in tumorigenesis [78], really play
important roles in CRC pathogenesis. In addition, CRC113 gene signature also contains epigenetics-related
genes, which have pivotal roles in cancer development.
NNMT controls hypomethylation of histones and other
cancer-related proteins [79]. The hypermethylation of
FBN1 and SFRP2 was reported as sensitive molecular
markers for detecting CRC [80, 81]. Finally, many novel
genes such as C5AR1, KRT80, FRMD6, OLFML2B,
PRRX1 and ZNF532 are included, suggesting that CRC113 gene signature contains new promising biomarkers
for CRC diagnosis and potential therapeutic targets.
Conclusively, we developed a robust gene
signature that is highly discriminative. We demonstrated
that CRC-113 gene signature predicts individual
patients at high risk of recurrence and mortality by
integrating CRC heterogeneity. The prognostic value
of our signature was statistically significant in the
overall data sets, independently of the pathological
staging. When incorporated into a clinical context and
molecular subtypes, CRC-113 gene signature further
stratified patients into two distinct prognostic risk
groups to overcome the limitation of the conventional
classification and molecular markers. Hence, we
propose that our CRC-113 gene signature provides a
basis for the rational design of potentially targetable
markers for CRC prognostic prediction.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Validation of the prognostic signature

Patient and gene expression data

The validation of the gene signature was
accomplished on independent data sets. Gene expression
data from different data sets were adjusted individually
by subtracting the median expression value across the
samples. To further refine this model and to sub-stratify
the predicted outcomes, Compound Covariate Predictor
(CCP) was utilized as a class prediction algorithm [85].
The robustness was estimated by the misclassification
rate that was determined during the leave-one-out
cross-validation (LOOCV) in the training set.
The Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed
after the patient classification into two risk groups, and
Chi-square (χ2) and log-rank tests were used to evaluate the
survival risk between two predicted subgroups of patients.
The univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard
regression analyses were used to evaluate independent
prognostic factors associated with survival, and then gene
signature, tumor grade and pathological characteristics
were employed as covariates.

All clinical and gene expression data are available
on Gene Expression Omnibus database (http://www
.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) fulfilling the following criteria:
a similar chip platform (Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 chips)
with raw data CEL files (Table 3) and clinical information
of patients on survival event and time (Table 4). The raw
data were normalized using a robust multiarray averaging
method [82, 83]. The 1,358 unique patients of six different
CRC data sets were used in the analysis. Gene expression
data of 340 patients who had no clinicopathological
information were excluded from survival analysis.
GSE17538 (n = 145, Moffitt Cancer Center, Vanderbilt
Medical Center) was used as a discovery data set [17].
The validation sets were GSE14333 (n = 226, Royal
Melbourne Hospital) [21], GSE33113 (n = 96, Academic
Medical Center in Amsterdam) which included only stage
II patients of CRC [22, 25] and GSE39582 (n = 557, the
French Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer) [23]. GSE21510
(n = 148, Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital)
[26] and GSE41328 (n = 20, University of Illinois) [27],
were used for comparing between normal subjects and
CRC patients.

Pathway analysis
Gene ontology (GO) biological process enrichment
analysis was carried out using the Database for
Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery
(DAVID) bioinformatics tool (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf
.gov/) [86]. The results of the GO analysis were visualized
in semantic similarity-based scatterplots via REViGO
[87], a web server that summarized GO terms by removing
redundant ones. The allowed similarity was chosen to
be small (0.5), and the semantic similarity measure was
‘SimRel’.

Development of the prognostic gene
expression signature
A gene expression signature to predict prognostic
risk was developed from the GSE17538 discovery
data set. Gene expression and disease-free survival
(DFS) data were combined to build a gene expression
profiling-based survival classifier. The 54,675 probe
sets were filtered by at least 2 absolute value of log2
scale which represented the same gene expression level.
The univariate Cox proportional hazard regression (p
< 0.001) was then used to identify the DFS-associated
gene expression signature from the discovery data
set. Regarding predicting prognosis, probes from the
survival signature were applied to the survival risk
prediction analysis [84]. This method used the principal
component from the discovery data set and produced a
prognostic index for each patient. The prognostic index
was computed by the formula ∑iwi xi - 0.256901 where
wi and xi were the weight and logged gene expression for
the i-th gene, respectively. We attempted to divide the
patients into two groups based on a median prognostic
index of −0.04444. Patients were assigned to the high
risk group if their prognostic indices were greater than
the median value, whereas the low risk group was
composed of patients with the prognostic indices that
were equivalent to or less than the median value.

STRING analysis
Protein-protein interactions were predicted using the
Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins
(STRING) database v10.0 (http://www.string-db.org/).
Proteins were linked based on the following six criteria;
neighborhood, gene fusion, co-occurrence, co-expression,
experimental evidence and existing databases [88].

Statistical methods of microarray data
Microarray data and heatmap were analyzed using
BRB-Array Tools Version 3.0 (http://linus.nci.nih.gov/
BRB-ArrayTools.html) [89]. All other statistical analyses
were accomplished in the R language environment (http:///
www.r-project.org) and Statistical Package for Social
Sciences (SPSS) software (version 20, SPSS Inc, Chicago,
IL, USA). In all statistical analyses, p value of less than
0.05 was considered significant.
