Abstract
One arising challenge in the treatment of breast cancer is the development of therapeutic resistance to
trastuzumab, an antibody targeting the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), which is frequently
amplified in breast cancers. In this study, we provide evidence that elevated level of the receptor tyrosine
kinase Eph receptor A2 (EphA2) is an important contributor to trastuzumab resistance. In a screen of a large
cohort of human breast cancers, we found that EphA2 overexpression correlated with a decrease in diseasefree and overall survival of HER2-overexpressing patients. Trastuzumab-resistant cell lines overexpressed
EphA2, whereas inhibiting EphA2 restored sensitivity to trastuzumab treatment in vivo. Notably, trastuzumab
treatment could promote EphA2 phosphorylation by activating Src kinase, leading in turn to an amplification
of phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in resistant cells. Our
findings offer mechanistic insights into the basis for trastuzumab resistance and rationalize strategies to
target EphA2 as a tactic to reverse trastuzumab resistance. Cancer Res; 70(1); 299–308. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Recent advances in the development and application of
molecularly targeted therapies for cancer have generated
promising new treatments. One such treatment is the recombinant humanized monoclonal anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin, Genentech). Trastuzumab targets the
human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2/ErbB2)
oncoprotein (1), a member of the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK).
HER2 is overexpressed in 25% to 30% of human breast cancers and is associated with poor patient survival (2). Despite
the proven benefit of trastuzumab in treating breast cancer
(3–5), not all patients with amplified HER2 respond to trastuzumab. Indeed, only one third of women with newly diagnosed HER2-positive breast cancer exhibit tumor regression
with trastuzumab monotherapy (5). In addition, the majority
of patients who achieve an initial response develop trastuzumab resistance within 1 year (5, 6). Therefore, identifying
mechanisms that modulate trastuzumab response and resis-

tance is vital to improving the therapeutic index of this
agent.
Eph receptor A2 (EphA2), an Eph-family RTK, has been recently linked to breast tumor initiation and metastatic progression (7–9). Experimentally induced overexpression of
EphA2 resulted in malignant transformation of nontransformed MCF10A breast epithelial cells and enhanced malignancy of pancreatic carcinoma cells (10, 11). Conversely,
small interfering RNA (siRNA)–mediated inhibition of EphA2
expression impaired the malignant progression of pancreatic,
ovarian, and mesothelioma human tumor cell lines, and
overexpression of dominant-negative EphA2 constructs suppressed the growth and metastasis of 4T1 mouse mammary
adenocarcinoma cells in vivo (10, 12–14). EphA2-mediated
oncogenesis seems to be ligand independent, and EphA2 often signals through cross talk with other cell surface receptors (15, 16). We recently reported that loss of EphA2
receptor impaired tumor initiation and metastatic progression in mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-Neu mice
(17). In human and murine breast carcinoma cells, EphA2
forms a complex with HER2, resulting in enhanced activation
of Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and RhoA
GTPase and increased cell proliferation and motility. These
data indicate that EphA2 promotes breast tumor formation
and metastatic progression by amplifying HER2 signaling.
In this report, we investigated the role of EphA2 in regulation of breast cancer sensitivity to trastuzumab. We found
that high EphA2 levels enhanced both intrinsic and acquired
trastuzumab resistance. Elevated EphA2 in resistant cells
seems to be activated by trastuzumab treatment–induced
Src kinase, and activated EphA2 amplifies signaling through
the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and MAPK pathways in resistant cells. In addition, microarray analysis of a
large cohort of human breast cancer specimens revealed that

high levels of EphA2 expression in HER2-positive patients
predict poor prognosis. Thus, these results provide new
mechanistic insights into the molecular basis of anti-HER2
resistance, and targeting EphA2 could represent an appealing
therapeutic strategy to increase the efficacy of HER2-based
treatments in breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
Survival analysis. The van der Vijver database, with microarray profiles of 295 human breast tumors and associated
clinical data, was obtained from Rosetta Inpharmatics.8 The
first 25% patients that exhibit higher HER2 expression were
defined as HER2 positive, as described (18–20). The HER2positive patients were further stratified into two groups
based on the expression levels of EphA2. Kaplan-Meier analyses were computed using R survival package. Statistical differences were determined by log-rank tests.
Cell culture. The MMTV-Neu tumor–derived cell line (21),
parental MCF10A cells, and MCF10A cells stably overexpressing HER2 were maintained as described previously (17). Parental and trastuzumab-resistant SK-BR-3 and BT-474 cells
were generously provided by Francisco Esteva (The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;
ref. 22) and Carlos Arteaga (Vanderbilt University, Nashville,
TN; ref. 22), respectively. Three-dimensional spheroid cultures were established on Matrigel as described (24). Cultures
were maintained for 8 d before photodocumentation. Digital
images were analyzed and the percentage of Ki67-positive
cells was quantified using LSM Image Browser (Zeiss) software. Results were derived from 10 colonies in two independent experiments. Statistical differences among groups were
determined by Student's t test.
Mice and in vivo tumor studies. Athymic nude female
mice, 3 to 4 wk old, were implanted with 1.5-mg, 60-d-release
17β-estradiol pellets s.c. The next day, trastuzumab-resistant
BT-474 cells (1.5 × 107; HR5) were resuspended in 100 μL
PBS/100 μL growth factor–reduced Matrigel and injected into the number 4 inguinal mammary gland fat pad as previously described (22). Tumor engraftment and growth was
verified by palpation and tumor volume was measured by a
caliper. Two weeks after transplantation, the mice were treated with control IgG (10 mg/kg; clone R347, MedImmune,
LLC), anti-EphA2 antibody (10 mg/kg; clone 3F2-3M, MedImmune, LLC), trastuzumab (20 mg/kg), or the combination of
anti-EphA2 antibody and trastuzumab by twice-weekly i.p.
injections. Tumors were harvested 2 wk after treatment
and data were derived from 10 independent animals per
treatment group in two independent experiments.
Histologic analyses. Tumors were sectioned by the Vanderbilt University Immunohistochemistry Core Facility. Immunohistochemical staining for EphA2, proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA), and CD31 was done as described
previously (25). Proliferation or apoptosis was quantified by
calculating the average percentage of PCNA- or terminal

Wang, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL) and serum starved for 48 h before being treated with trastuzumab
(10 μg/mL). Imaging and fluorescence resonance energy
transfer (FRET) analysis were done on an LSM 510 META
confocal microscope (Zeiss) using a 40×/1.3 NAPlan-Neofluar
objective lens and 458-nm laser excitation for cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and FRET. Emission from CFP versus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)/FRET was discriminated using
appropriate bandpass emission filters (BP 475-525 for CFP
and LP560 for YFP/FRET). The fluorescence intensities of
CFP and YFP images were measured using the Zeiss Image
Examiner software before being quantified and analyzed by
Prism 5 (GraphPad). Quantification was based on 20 cells per
time point in two independent experiments. Statistical differences were analyzed using Student's t test.

Elevation of EphA2 Promotes Anti-HER2 Resistance

mouse models suggest that cooperation between HER2 and
EphA2 may promote mammary tumor formation, we sought
to determine if EphA2 could be an effective therapeutic target for HER2-positive breast cancer patients. To analyze the
effect of EphA2 overexpression on the prognosis of HER2positive breast cancer patients, we examined previously
published microarray data for a panel of 295 breast cancer
samples (26). Seventy-four HER2-positive samples were
examined for EphA2 mRNA expression. The resulting
Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival data revealed that high levels of EphA2 expression correlated with a decrease in overall
(Fig. 1A) and recurrence-free survival (Fig. 1B) in HER2-positive breast cancer patients. These data indicate that EphA2
overexpression in HER2-positive patients may predict poor
prognosis, and elevated EphA2 may enable breast cancer
cells to resist anti-HER2 treatment.
EphA2 overexpression confers cellular intrinsic resistance to trastuzumab. To investigate whether EphA2
overexpression is sufficient to confer resistance to trastuzumab, we transduced a constitutively activated (CA-EphA2)

or a kinase-dead (KD-EphA2) form of human EphA2 into
MCF10A.HER2 cells (ref. 27; Supplementary Fig. S1A).
MCF10A.HER2 cells formed large acinar-like structure with
a filled lumen and were sensitive to trastuzumab treatment
(Fig. 2A; ref. 28). Introduction of CA-EphA2 into in MCF10A.
HER2 cells further enhanced cell proliferation, but this increased cell growth in MCF10A.HER2 cells expressing CAEphA2 was refractory to trastuzumab (Fig. 2A and B). In
contrast, expression of catalytically inactive KD-EphA2 in
MCF10A.HER2 cells decreased the basal rates of proliferation, which were further decreased on treatment with trastuzumab (Fig. 2A and B). These data are consistent with
previous data showing cooperation between HER2 and
EphA2 to drive cellular proliferation (17), and further suggest that EphA2 kinase activity is able to promote trastuzumab resistance in HER2-overexpressing breast cells.
Interestingly, MCF10A.HER2 cells express elevated levels
of EphA2 protein relative to those in parental MCF10A
cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B). To determine if inhibition
of EphA2 increases innate sensitivity to trastuzumab,

than either antibody alone (Fig. 2C and D). Taken together,
these data suggest that EphA2 overexpression is one
mechanism of intrinsic resistance to trastuzumab.

expression levels correlate with trastuzumab resistance, we

Elevation of EphA2 Promotes Anti-HER2 Resistance

overexpressed HER2 in a panel of human breast cancer cell
lines that express EphA2 protein at low or high levels (Supplementary Fig. S2A). BT-474 and SK-BR-3 cells that express
high levels of endogenous HER2 but low levels of EphA2 were
growth inhibited in response to trastuzumab, and so were
MCF7 and T47D that overexpress HER2 (Supplementary
Fig. S2B). In contrast, HBL100, MDA-468, MDA-231, and
BT-549 expressed high levels of EphA2 and were resistant
to the growth inhibitory effects of trastuzumab. These data
are consistent with a correlation between EphA2 expression
and trastuzumab response in HER2-overexpressing human
breast cancer cells.
EphA2 elevation contributes to acquired trastuzumab
resistance. Genome-wide profiling of gene expression
showed that EphA2 and HER2 are not always coexpressed
in human breast cancer. We reasoned that on prolonged
trastuzumab treatment, a subset of HER2-positive tumors
that initially express low levels of EphA2 and respond to trastuzumab may increase EphA2 expression, leading to a decrease in trastuzumab sensitivity. To test this possibility,
we analyzed EphA2 expression in two independent trastuzumabresistant human breast cancer cell lines, SK-BR-3 and BT474, which were derived from in vitro or in vivo selection
for acquired resistance to trastuzumab, respectively (22, 23).
As shown in Fig. 3A, EphA2 levels were considerably higher in
two independently derived trastuzumab-resistant clones
from each cell line relative to their trastuzumab-sensitive parental cells. To test whether this EphA2 overexpression is required to maintain trastuzumab resistance, we treated the
parental and the trastuzumab-resistant cells with anti-EphA2
antibody in the presence or absence of trastuzumab. As expected, sensitive SK-BR-3 and BT-474 cells were growth inhibited by trastuzumab whereas resistant cells were not.
Anti-EphA2 antibody alone did not significantly affect cell
growth in SK-BR-3 or BT-474 cells. However, EphA2 inhibition restored cellular sensitivity to trastuzumab in each resistant cell line, as shown in both two-dimensional cell culture
(Fig. 3B) and three-dimensional Matrigel culture (Fig. 3C).
These data suggest that EphA2 is upregulated in treatmentinduced, trastuzumab-resistant cells and that high levels of
EphA2 in resistant cells contribute to acquired trastuzumab
resistance.
Targeting EphA2 inhibits trastuzumab-resistant tumor
growth in vivo. Having shown the combinatorial activity
of anti-EphA2 antibody and trastuzumab for growth inhibition of trastuzumab-resistant cells in vitro, we next investigated the therapeutic potential of an anti-EphA2 antibody
for the treatment of trastuzumab-resistant tumor growth
in vivo in an orthotopic xenograft model. Trastuzumabresistant BT-474 cells were injected into the mammary fat
pad of female athymic nude mice. Two weeks after transplantation, when tumor volume reached ∼200 mm3, mice
were treated with either control IgG or antihuman EphA2
antibody (10 mg/kg) in the presence or absence of trastuzumab (20 mg/kg). Consistent with a prior report (22), resistant BT-474 tumors did not respond to trastuzumab
treatment as compared with IgG-treated tumors. AntiEphA2 antibody treatment moderately reduced tumor size

relative to controls. In contrast, coadministration of antiEphA2 antibody with trastuzumab markedly reduced tumor
volume (Fig. 4A and B).
To examine cellular changes within treated tumors, we analyzed cell proliferation and apoptosis in tissue sections by
staining for PCNA and by TUNEL assay, respectively. Quantitation of PCNA-positive nuclei revealed a nearly 2-fold decrease in PCNA staining in tumors treated with the
combination of anti-EphA2 antibody versus tumors treated
with control IgG (P < 0.05; Fig. 4C). In contrast, treatment
with anti-EphA2 antibody alone or with trastuzumab alone
did not significantly alter the proportion of PCNA-positive
cells as compared with IgG-treated tumors. Similarly, apoptosis was increased ∼6-fold in tumors treated with the combination of anti-EphA2 antibody and trastuzumab (P < 0.01;
Fig. 4C) but was unaltered in tumors treated with either antibody alone. Taken together, these data suggest that targeting
EphA2 may be effective for the suppression of trastuzumabresistant breast tumor growth.
EphA2 regulates breast cancer cell sensitivity to trastuzumab by modulation of Akt and MAPK activities. Breast
cancer resistance to HER2 inhibitors could arise through
multiple mechanisms, including activation of alternative
growth factor receptors or enhancing downstream signaling
pathways. We investigated potential mechanisms by which
EphA2 contributes to trastuzumab resistance in HER2overexpressing breast cancer. We found that elimination
of EphA2 by siRNA knockdown or anti-EphA2 antibody
reduced phospho-Akt and phospho-extracellular signalregulated kinase (Erk) levels in trastuzumab-resistant cells
(Fig. 5A and B), suggesting that EphA2 expression and activity are required to maintain signaling through the PI3K-Akt
and MAPK signaling pathways.
To determine whether the PI3K-Akt and Ras-MAPK signaling pathways play a causal role in trastuzumab resistance, we
treated SK-BR-3 cells with a PI3K inhibitor, LY294002
(Fig. 5C), or a mitogen-activated protein/Erk kinase (MEK)
inhibitor, U0126 (Fig. 5D), and analyzed cell growth in the
presence or absence of trastuzumab. In sensitive cells, cell
growth is inhibited by trastuzumab, and addition of
LY294002 or U0126 did not further affect cell growth significantly. However, although resistant cells do not respond to
trastuzumab, they are exquisitely sensitive to the MEK inhibitor (Fig. 5D). In fact, resistant cells are more sensitive
to U0126 than trastuzumab-sensitive cells, suggesting that
trastuzumab-resistant cells are dependent on MAPK signaling. In addition, either PI3K inhibitor or MEK inhibitor significantly restored trastuzumab sensitivity in resistant cells.
Together, our data suggest that anti-EphA2 antibody therapy
reverses trastuzumab resistance by inhibiting the activation
of both Akt and MAPK.
Chronic trastuzumab treatment activates EphA2
through Src kinase. To investigate how EphA2 is activated
in trastuzumab-resistant cells, we examined the involvement
of Src kinase because prior studies showed that Src directly
interacts with HER2 and is activated in HER2-overexpressing
cancer cells (29, 30). Coexpression of HER2 and EphA2 in
COS7 cells was sufficient to induce tyrosine phosphorylation

be activated by trastuzumab. A previous study suggested that
short exposure to trastuzumab rapidly inhibits Src kinase activity (31). However, we found that longer treatment of SKBR-3 cells with trastuzumab increased Src phosphorylation
at Y416, an indicator of Src activation (Supplementary

Fig. S3B). To further determine whether prolonged trastuzumab treatment can activate Src kinase, we used a Src biosensor that enables the visualization of Src activity in live cells
with high spatiotemporal resolution by FRET technology
(32, 33). Trastuzumab induced a 15% to 25% reduction in
Src activity within 1 hour in MCF7.HER2 cells transfected
with the Src biosensor, but the decrease in Src activity gradually
recovered with prolonged trastuzumab incubation (Fig. 6A).
After 24 hours of treatment, Src activity increased by 35% in
MCF7.HER2 relative to control cells (Fig. 6B), whereas EphA2
levels were not changed (Supplementary Fig. S3C). These
data support the existence of a switch from trastuzumabinduced Src inhibition to activation, which could modulate
EphA2 activity in resistant cells. Indeed, EphA2 and Src
were highly phosphorylated in trastuzumab-resistant cells.
Src inhibitors, PP2 (Fig. 6C) or dasatinib (data not shown),
inhibited the activities of both Src and EphA2.

To determine whether Src kinase contributes to trastuzumab resistance, we treated SK-BR-3 cells with trastuzumab, dasatinib, or their combination and assessed cell viability.
Dasatinib inhibited cell growth in both sensitive and resistant
cells. Whereas resistant cells did not respond to trastuzumab,
dasatinib partially restored trastuzumab sensitivity in resistant
cells (Fig. 6D). Together, these results provide a clear link between activation of Src and EphA2 in trastuzumab resistance.

Discussion
In this report, we described a novel mechanism by which
HER2-positive breast cancers acquire resistance to trastuzumab. The RTK EphA2 was found to correlate with a poor
prognosis in patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancers and had a greater negative impact on patient survival in
HER2-overexpressing breast cancers as compared with other

breast cancers. We found that overexpression of EphA2 in
HER2-positive breast cancer cells was sufficient to confer innate resistance to trastuzumab. Furthermore, antibodymediated EphA2 inhibition enhanced tumor response to
trastuzumab both in cell culture and in vivo. These data suggest that therapeutic inhibition of EphA2 may represent a
strategy for improving the clinical response of trastuzumab.
What is the mechanism by which elevated EphA2 confers
tumor cell resistance to trastuzumab? Resistance to antiHER2/ErbB2 agents could arise through multiple mechanisms,
including altered receptor-antibody interaction, activation of
alternative growth factor receptor signaling pathways, and
deregulation of downstream signaling pathways (34, 35).
The most common downstream signaling pathway that contributes to trastuzumab resistance is the PI3K-Akt pathway.
Persistent activation of PI3K-Akt signaling in resistant cells

306

Cancer Res; 70(1) January 1, 2010

could result from multiple mechanisms such as oncogenic
mutations of PI3K (36), loss of PTEN (31), or upregulation of
insulin-like growth factor-I receptor and EGFR activity (22, 37).
In this case, targeting EphA2 inhibited the PI3K-Akt pathway
in trastuzumab resistant cells (Fig. 5). In addition to regulating
Akt activity, we discovered that EphA2 also modulates phospho-Erk levels in resistant cells. Increased EphA2 expression in
resistant cells enhanced phospho-Erk levels, and targeting
EphA2 with siRNA or anti-EphA2 antibody inhibited Erk activity (Fig. 5). These data, together with reports from other laboratories (38, 39), suggest that the development of trastuzumab
resistance may involve simultaneous activation of multiple
parallel signaling cascades including the PI3K-Akt and MAPK
pathways (40–42). Indeed, a MEK inhibitor that suppresses
phospho-Erk significantly decreased the viability of resistant
cells (Fig. 5D). Suppression of MAPK activity by EphA2

Elevation of EphA2 Promotes Anti-HER2 Resistance

antibody was also observed in MCF10A three-dimensional culture (data not shown), as well as in MMTV-Neu cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A), where Erk phosphorylation recovered after
prolonged treatment with gefitinib, a dual inhibitor of EGFR
and ErbB2/Neu (43). The combination of anti-EphA2 antibody
and gefitinib completely abrogated MAPK activity and inhibited tumor growth in vivo (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Together,
these data suggest that modulation of both Akt and MAPK
signaling is a primary mechanism through which EphA2
contributes to trastuzumab resistance.
How is EphA2 receptor activated in trastuzumab-resistant
cells? We have previously shown that EphA2 forms a complex with HER2/ErbB2 and can be phosphorylated in the
presence of HER2/ErbB2 (17). However, we failed to detect
direct EphA2 tyrosine phosphorylation by HER2 in an in vitro
kinase assay (data not shown), indicating the possibility of
involvement of another kinase. One candidate is the nonRTK Src because Src directly interacts with HER2 and is activated in HER2-overexpressing cancer cells (29, 30). Indeed,
Src is sufficient to activate EphA2 and is required for
the phosphorylation of EphA2 by HER2 (Supplementary
Fig. S3A). Although trastuzumab reportedly inhibits Src activity within a short time frame (31), we observed increased Src
activity in cells on prolonged exposure to trastuzumab (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Using a FRET-based Src reporter to
monitor Src activity in live cells, we found that short-term
exposure to trastuzumab inhibits Src kinase activity, consistent with a previous report (31). However, prolonged treatment resulted in increased Src activity (Fig. 6A and B).
These results were supported by biochemical studies, in
which Src phosphorylation at Y416 was increased with prolonged trastuzumab treatment. The mechanism of switch between trastuzumab-induced Src inhibition and activation is
unclear. We speculate that continuous exposure to trastuzumab may cluster HER2 at the plasma membrane and recruit
Src into the HER2/EphA2 complex, resulting in activation of
Src and phosphorylation of EphA2 receptor.
Our findings that EphA2 coexpresses with HER2 and confers trastuzumab resistance in HER2-positive breast cancers
could directly affect the clinical management of these patients. We propose that individuals with EphA2 and HER2positive breast cancer might benefit from pharmacologic
inhibition of EphA2 in combination with anti-HER2 thera-

pies. EphA2 expression may also be used as a prognostic
marker to predict trastuzumab resistance and treatment outcome. In patients who initially are negative for EphA2 but
subsequently develop resistance to trastuzumab, elevated
EphA2 could be one of the mechanisms that confer tumor
resistance to HER2 inhibitors. Targeting EphA2 may represent a novel strategy to overcome trastuzumab resistance.
In summary, our studies provide new mechanistic insights
into the molecular basis of trastuzumab resistance. These
studies provide a basis for rational design of combination
therapies to overcome tumor resistance to trastuzumab.
