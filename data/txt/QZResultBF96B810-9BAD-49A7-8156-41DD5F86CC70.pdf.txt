Abstract
Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant pediatric
brain tumor, with metastases present at diagnosis conferring a
poor prognosis. Mechanisms of dissemination are poorly
understood and metastatic lesions are genetically divergent
from the matched primary tumor. Effective and less toxic
therapies that target both compartments have yet to be identiﬁed. Here, we report that the analysis of several large nonoverlapping cohorts of patients with medulloblastoma reveals
MET kinase as a marker of sonic hedgehog (SHH)–driven
medulloblastoma. Immunohistochemical analysis of phosphorylated, active MET kinase in an independent patient cohort
conﬁrmed its correlation with increased tumor relapse and
poor survival, suggesting that patients with SHH medulloblas-

toma may beneﬁt from MET-targeted therapy. In support of this
hypothesis, we found that the approved MET inhibitor foretinib could suppress MET activation, decrease tumor cell proliferation, and induce apoptosis in SHH medulloblastomas
in vitro and in vivo. Foretinib penetrated the blood–brain barrier
and was effective in both the primary and metastatic tumor
compartments. In established mouse xenograft or transgenic
models of metastatic SHH medulloblastoma, foretinib administration reduced the growth of the primary tumor, decreased
the incidence of metastases, and increased host survival. Taken
together, our results provide a strong rationale to clinically
evaluate foretinib as an effective therapy for patients with SHHdriven medulloblastoma. Cancer Res; 75(1); 134–46. 2014 AACR.

Introduction

majority of survivors suffer from severe neurocognitive deﬁcits
induced by the deleterious effects of treatment on the developing
nervous system (1). The discovery of novel and less toxic therapies
has been hampered by the poor understanding of the mechanisms
of dissemination, and by the failure to account for the genetic
divergence between metastatic lesions and their matched primary
tumor. Recent studies have shed light into the candidate genes
that drive leptomeningeal dissemination in medulloblastoma
(2, 3), but therapies that target both the primary and the metastatic compartment have not been identiﬁed.
The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/cMET pathway is essential
for cell proliferation and migration during embryogenesis (4)
and, in the central nervous system, it plays a critical role in
cerebellar development (5). Aberrant cMET signaling is known
to be involved in tumor growth and metastatic behavior of several
human cancers (6, 7). The transmembrane receptor cMET is
activated through phosphorylation of tyrosine residues upon
binding of its ligand HGF, which triggers multiple downstream
effector cascades including MAPK and PI3K/AKT that function in
various cellular processes including cell proliferation, cell survival, migration, and invasion (8). In medulloblastoma, cMET
activation is associated with tumor growth and anaplastic histology (9). cMET signaling is deregulated in medulloblastoma
through multiple, independent molecular mechanisms including
epigenetic silencing of an upstream inhibitor, the serine protease
inhibitor Kunitz-type 2 (SPINT2; refs. 10, 11). Previous studies have
shown that cMET inhibition can effectively decrease medulloblastoma cell migration and invasion (12).

Medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor
in childhood, has a high tendency to disseminate through the
cerebrospinal ﬂuid to the brain and the spinal cord leptomeninges. Dissemination is a known factor of poor survival and
occurs in one third of the children at the time of diagnosis and in
two thirds by the time of relapse. Affected children are treated with
craniospinal radiation and high-dose chemotherapy but the

Foretinib Treatment in Metastatic SHH Medulloblastoma

Foretinib is an orally available multikinase inhibitor that
targets cMET with high afﬁnity (IC50 ¼ 0.4 nmol/L; ref. 13).
Foretinib has demonstrated antitumor activity in preclinical
models of different tumor types (14–16) and clinical trials are
currently ongoing to determine its efﬁcacy in various solid, non–
central nervous system tumors (17, 18). To date, the ability of
foretinib to penetrate the brain is unknown.
Foretinib also targets other tyrosine kinases with lower afﬁnity,
including the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta
(PDGFRb) with an IC50 of 9.6 nmol/L. Interestingly, PDGFRb is
known to be overexpressed in metastatic medulloblastoma (19,
20), and targeting the receptor reduces proliferation and migration of medulloblastoma cell lines (21). Activation of PDGFRb
occurs through a similar mechanism to cMET receptor activation,
in which ligand binding (PDGF-BB) induces receptor autophosphorylation and activates downstream signaling via MAPK and
AKT (22).
Therefore, we sought to establish the subgroup-speciﬁc role of
cMET and PDGFRb in medulloblastoma, and to test the efﬁcacy
of foretinib to cross the blood–brain barrier and to target those
pathways, both in the primary and in the metastatic
compartments.

Materials and Methods
Tumor material and patient characteristics
All tissues and clinicopathologic information were serially
collected in accordance with Institutional Review Boards from
contributing institutions. Nucleic acid extractions were carried out
as previously described (23).
Expression proﬁling and molecular subgrouping
Expression of candidate genes was assessed using the R2 software in independent gene expression cohorts (24–32). Expression
of reported intermediates of MET signaling was visualized using
heatmaps (7). Associations between gene expression and subgroup afﬁliation were evaluated using one-way ANOVA. P values
< 0.05 were considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.
Analysis of somatic copy-number alterations
Somatic copy-number alterations were assessed on the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array platform in 1,239 cases. Raw copy-number
estimates were obtained in dChip, followed by circular binary
segmentation (CBS) in R as previously described (27).
Cell lines and animal models
Human medulloblastoma cell lines (Daoy, ONS76 and D425)
were kindly provided by Dr. Annie Huang, Hospital for Sick
Children, Toronto, Canada. All cell lines were authenticated and
tested by PCR. Daoy-GFP/Luciferase cells were generated as
described previously (33). Athymic nude mice were obtained
from the Charles River Laboratory. Ptchþ//SB11/T2Onc mice
(2) were generously provided by Dr. Michael Taylor, Hospital
for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.
Cell culture assays for cMET and PDGFRb signaling
Foretinib was purchased from Selleck Chemicals, dissolved in
DMSO (Sigma), and stored at 20 C. Cells were serum starved for
24 hours in media with 0.1% (Daoy and ONS76) and 2% FBS
(D425), pretreated with increasing concentrations of foretinib or

www.aacrjournals.org

1% v/v DMSO for 2 hours, and stimulated with human recombinant HGF (20 ng/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 minutes or human
PDGF-BB (20 ng/mL; Cell Signaling) for 10 minutes.
Migration and invasion assays
The protocols for migration and invasion assays were as
described previously (34).
For the radial migration assays, medulloblastoma cells were
seeded and allowed to migrate for 24 hours in starved media
(0.1% FBS) containing HGF (50 ng/mL) or PDGF-BB (50 ng/mL),
in the presence or absence of foretinib. The radius of the migrating
cells was measured and compared with the initial radius using a
Leica Fluorescent Stereoscope (2.5 magniﬁcation).
The invasion assays were performed using Matrigel Invasion
Chambers (8 mm pore size; BD Biosciences). Daoy and ONS76
cells were incubated for 16 hours with starved media containing
dilutions of foretinib. The number of cells per 6 random ﬁelds was
determined (10 magniﬁcation) using Volocity software (Perkin
Elmer).
Immunoblotting
The following antibodies from Cell Signaling were used: cMET
(1:1,000), phospho-cMET (1:1,000), PDGFRb (1:500), phosphoPDGFRb (1:500), AKT (1:1,000), phospho-AKT (1:2,000), p44/
42 MAPK (1:1,000), phospho-p44/42 MAPK (1:2,000), PARP
(1:1,000), b-actin (1:10,000), anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase (1:5,000), and anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5,000). Western blot analysis and
quantiﬁcation were performed using the Fluorchem Q Imaging
System (ProteinSimple).
Cell proliferation assays
Medulloblastoma cells were treated with different concentrations of foretinib or DMSO, and cell viability was determined for
the indicated time points by MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium)
absorbance at 490 nm (CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution
Reagent; Promega).
Active caspase assays
The activity of caspases 3 and 7 was measured using the ApoONE Homogeneous Caspase-3/7 Assay (Promega) after 12 hours
of incubation.
Foretinib pharmacokinetic studies
Detection and quantiﬁcation of foretinib were performed using
a high-performance LC/MS/MS method (Agilent 1290 HPLC
Agilent Technologies/QTRAP 5500 AB SCIEX).
Images of foretinib distribution in various mouse organs were
acquired using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
(MALDI) time-of-ﬂight tandem mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX
TOF/TOF 5800 System; AB SCIEX).
Medulloblastoma xenografts and transgenic mouse models
All mouse studies were approved and performed in accordance
to the policies and regulations of the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of the University of Toronto and the Hospital
for Sick Children, in Toronto.
Mouse subcutaneous xenografts (Daoy and ONS76) were
established in athymic nude mice (Charles River Laboratories).
Intracranial xenografts of disseminated medulloblastoma were

Foretinib Treatment in Metastatic SHH Medulloblastoma

established by injecting Daoy cells into the fourth ventricle of
athymic nude mice. Tumor growth and the presence of metastases were evaluated by weekly bioluminescence imaging using
the IVIS Spectrum Optical In-vivo Imaging System (Caliper Life
Sciences).
Osmotic pumps (Alzet; model 2004) were implanted in Ptchþ/
mice with Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposition (Ptchþ//SB11/T2Onc)
at postnatal days 30 to 35. Pumps loaded with foretinib (6 mg/kg)
infused the drug into the cerebrospinal ﬂuid (right lateral ventricle)
for 28 days at a rate of 0.25 mL/hour.
Immunohistochemistry
The protocol for immunohistochemistry was performed as
previously described (35). The following antibodies were used:
Ki-67 (1:1,000; Novus), cleaved caspase 3 (1:800; Cell Signaling),
phospho-cMET (1:100; Cell Signaling), and phospho-PDGFRb
(1:200; Abcam).
Statistical analysis
Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan–Meier estimate and a log-rank test. The comparison between binary and
categorical patient characteristics was performed using the twosided Fisher exact test. To analyze contiguous variables, the
Mann–Whitney U test was used.
Results from experiments were expressed as mean  SEM. For
multiple group comparisons, ANOVA was conducted followed by a
post-Tukey test or a post-Dunnett test. Direct comparisons using an
unpaired two-tailed Student t test were conducted where appropriate. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5
Software. We considered a P value inferior to 0.05 as signiﬁcant.

Results
cMET and PDGFRb are highly expressed in SHH
medulloblastomas
We evaluated the expression of cMET and PDGFRb in a discovery
cohort of primary medulloblastomas from Boston (n ¼ 199;
ref. 26). cMET expression was highly upregulated in most SHH
medulloblastomas and in a subset of group 3 tumors (Fig. 1A).
PDGFRb was expressed across all medulloblastoma subgroups,
with higher levels of expression in SHH tumors (Fig. 1B). We
conﬁrmed our results using a multicenter validation cohort of 439
cases proﬁled on the Affymetrix 133plus 2.0 arrays obtained from
the German Cancer Research Centre, Heidelberg (validation
cohort; refs. 24, 25, 31, 32, M. Kool and S.M Pﬁster, unpublished
data; Fig. 1C and D).
To identify molecular markers of cMET pathway activation in
SHH medulloblastomas, we interrogated three independent datasets using a group of genes known to activate cMET signaling (7,
8). In addition to cMET, GAB1 expression was highly and specifically upregulated in SHH-driven medulloblastomas, across the
three nonoverlapping cohorts, when compared with normal
cerebellum and with non-SHH medulloblastomas (Fig. 1E–J).

To investigate possible mechanisms leading to cMET and
PDGFRb overexpression, we examined the subgroup-speciﬁc
copy number aberrations (CNA) encompassing the MET loci
(7q31.2) and the PDGFRb loci (5q31), in a large cohort of
1,239 medulloblastomas (27). There were no focal gains or
ampliﬁcations of cMET (Supplementary Fig. S1A) and very infrequent copy-number gains affecting the PDGFRb loci (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Identiﬁcation of biologic pathways and processes associated
with high cMET and low cMET SHH medulloblastomas
We performed gene set enrichment analysis between tumors
with the highest (n ¼ 13) and the lowest (n ¼ 13) cMET expression
across a series of 51 primary SHH medulloblastomas (27). Gene
sets were compiled from Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), the National Cancer
Institute (NCI), Protein Families (PFAM), and Biocarta pathway
databases. To visualize signiﬁcant gene sets (FDR < 0.25; P < 0.01)
as interaction networks, we used Cytoscape and Enrichment Map
(Supplementary Fig. S2). High cMET SHH medulloblastomas
were characterized by gene sets involved in organ development
and morphogenesis, cell migration, cell cycle and DNA repair, Tcell differentiation, transcription, and mitochondrial function.
Low cMET SHH medulloblastomas were deﬁned by numerous
networks including neural development, neurotransmission,
amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, ribonucleotide biosynthesis, smooth muscle contraction, and Ras-GTPase activity.
High p-cMET levels correlate with recurrence and poorer
survival in SHH medulloblastomas
We stained medulloblastoma tissue microarrays comprised of
an independent cohort of 385 patients for the activated cMET
receptor or phosphorylated cMET (p-cMET). Eighty percent (104/
128) of SHH tumors and approximately 25% (16/62) of group 3
tumors showed high p-cMET staining (Fig. 2A). High p-cMET was
associated with older age at diagnosis (Supplementary Fig. S3A
and S3B) and desmoplastic histology (Supplementary Fig. S3C
and S3D), most likely due to a subgroup-speciﬁc enrichment with
SHH patients. There was a signiﬁcant correlation between high pcMET and an increased 5-year rate of recurrence across all subgroups of pediatric medulloblastomas (P ¼ 0.041; Fig. 2B) and,
particularly, across pediatric SHH tumors (P ¼ 0.011; Fig. 2C).
There was no association of p-cMET expression and the presence
of metastases or TP53 mutational status in SHH tumors (Supplementary Fig. S3E and S3F).
High p-cMET expression in SHH tumors was associated with
a signiﬁcantly shorter progression-free survival (P ¼ 0.007;
Fig. 2D), particularly in the pediatric cohort (P ¼ 0.002;
Fig. 2E). A trend toward a worse overall survival was also observed in these patients (Fig. 2F and G). Interestingly, considering the metastatic status within SHH medulloblastomas, the
prognostic impact of high p-cMET expression was still observed.
High p-cMET correlated (P ¼ 0.022) with a poor outcome in

Thus, we conclude that activated cMET deﬁnes distinct prognostic patient cohorts with higher recurrence rate and poorer
prognosis in SHH subgroup of medulloblastomas.
Foretinib inhibits cMET and PDGFRb pathway activity
On the basis of the elevated expression levels of cMET and
PDGFRb in SHH and group 3 medulloblastomas, we sought to
evaluate the antitumoral effect of foretinib against medulloblastoma cell lines representative of these two subgroups.
Daoy, ONS76, and D425 cells have transcriptional and cytogenetic features that suggest they are originally derived from

Foretinib Treatment in Metastatic SHH Medulloblastoma

SHH (Daoy and ONS76) and group 3 (D425) tumors (36).
Furthermore, they express different levels of the tyrosine kinase
receptors cMET and PDGFRb (Supplementary Fig. S5A). First,
we evaluated the ability of foretinib to inhibit the cMET and the
PDGFRb pathway activity in the context of HGF or PDGF-BB
stimulation. Foretinib potently inhibited the HGF-induced
cMET pathway activation, as evidenced by the suppression in
cMET phosphorylation and also by the decrease in the phosphorylation of downstream effectors AKT and MAPK (Fig. 3A
and B). The inhibitory effect of foretinib in PDGF-BB–induced
PDGFRb pathway activation was moderate (Supplementary Fig.
S5B and S5C). Furthermore, a signiﬁcant antiproliferative effect
(Fig. 3C; Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B) and an induction of
apoptosis (Fig. 3D and E; Supplementary Fig. S6C and S6D)
were observed in foretinib-treated medulloblastoma cells. Foretinib potently inhibited HGF-mediated migration (Fig. 3F and
G; Supplementary Fig. S6E and S6F) and invasion (Fig. 3H and
Supplementary Fig. S6G) of Daoy and ONS76 cells for all drug
concentrations. In contrast, a signiﬁcant reduction in migration
and invasion mediated by PDGF-BB was only seen with 2.5
mmol/L of foretinib (Supplementary Fig. S6H and S6I).
We then assessed if cMET receptor knockdown by stable
shRNA expression would phenocopy the functional effects of
foretinib treatment. cMET shRNA 2 was able to knockdown over
70% of cMET expression in both Daoy (Fig. 3I) and ONS76
(Supplementary Fig. S6J). A signiﬁcant antiproliferative effect
was observed in both medulloblastoma cells (Fig. 3J and Supplementary Fig. S6K) stably expressing cMET shRNA compared
with nonsilencing control cells. Furthermore, a signiﬁcant inhibition of HGF-mediated invasion was observed (Fig. 3K and
Supplementary Fig. S6L). Interestingly, the relative inhibition of
invasion in cMET shRNA expressing Daoy cells mimics the
treatment of Daoy cells with 500 nmol/L to 1 mmol/L of foretinib (Fig. 3H)
Collectively, these results suggest that foretinib exhibits a
signiﬁcant in vitro inhibitory activity in medulloblastoma cells,
mainly through blockade of the cMET pathway.
Foretinib induces medulloblastoma regression in vivo
We sought to investigate the antitumor activity of foretinib in
vivo using subcutaneous xenograft models of SHH medulloblastoma. Daoy and ONS76 cells were implanted in the ﬂank of
nude mice, and animals with established tumors were treated
by oral gavage with vehicle (DMSO) or foretinib (60 and 100
mg/kg), once every other day for 9 days. Therapy with foretinib
signiﬁcantly induced tumor regression at all drug concentrations administered. At the end of treatment, tumor volumes
were reduced by 37% and 46% with 60 and 100 mg/kg of
foretinib, respectively, in Daoy xenografts (Fig. 4A and B) and
by 50% in ONS76 xenografts (Supplementary Fig. S7A and
S7B). Foretinib was well tolerated as mice body weights were
maintained during the treatment period for all cohorts (Fig. 4C
and Supplementary Fig. S7C).
Medulloblastoma tumor growth inhibition in mice treated
with foretinib was associated with concomitant reduction in
cMET and PDGFRb pathway activity (Fig. 4D and Supplementary
Fig. S7D). Foretinib treatment resulted in a potent inhibition of
cMET phosphorylation in all cohorts (Fig. 4E and Supplementary
Fig. S7E) and a moderate reduction in PDGFRb activation (Fig.
4F). Tumors treated with foretinib also displayed signiﬁcant dosedependent decrease in cell proliferation (Fig. 4G and Supplemen-

www.aacrjournals.org

tary Fig. S7F), and increase in apoptosis (Fig. 4H and Supplementary Fig. S7G).
These studies demonstrate that foretinib has a signiﬁcant in vivo
antitumor effect in medulloblastoma allografts, through a potent
suppression of the cMET pathway activity and a moderate inhibition of PDGFRb signaling.
Characterization of foretinib pharmacokinetics and brain
permeability
To further evaluate the potential clinical relevance of foretinib in brain tumor treatment, we assessed the pharmacokinetics of the drug and its ability to penetrate into the brain.
Nude mice were treated by oral gavage with 30, 60, and 100
mg/kg of foretinib, and blood and the perfused brains were
harvested at speciﬁc time points. Foretinib was detected in
samples from treated animals using high-performance LC/MS/
MS. Maximum concentrations of foretinib in the plasma and
in the brain of mice occurred 5 hours after oral administration
with no difference between dose levels (Fig. 5A and B). The
same pharmacokinetic features were previously reported in a
phase I clinical trial of foretinib in adult patients with
advanced solid tumors outside the central nervous system
(17). Furthermore, after 5 consecutive days of treatment with
60 mg/kg of oral foretinib, the penetration of the drug in the
brain was approximately 14% (Supplementary Table S1).
We then assessed the distribution of foretinib in different
mouse organs using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
with time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF) imaging.
Foretinib produces a strong signal (Fig. 5C and D) and ﬁve hours
after oral administration, when it reaches the maximum plasma
concentration, the drug is seen in the liver and also in the renal
cortex (Fig. 5E). The concentration of foretinib in the brain after
oral gavage was below the threshold detection of MALDI-TOF
imaging.
To explore the potential use of foretinib for intrathecal
therapy in neuro-oncology, we used osmotic pumps to deliver
the drug into the lateral ventricles of mice. After injection of 6
mg/kg of foretinib for 28 days at a rate of 0.25 mL/hour, the
drug was distributed through the cerebrospinal ﬂuid to the
supra- and infratentorial compartments (Fig. 5F; ref. 37).
Foretinib was detected by MALDI-TOF imaging in the right
frontal lobe of mice due to its very high concentration at the
drug delivery site (Fig. 5G). The drug was well tolerated and
the mice did not display any signs of central nervous system
toxicity.
Collectively, these studies demonstrate for the ﬁrst time, to our
knowledge, that foretinib crosses the blood–brain barrier and can
be safely administered as intrathecal therapy.

Foretinib reduces SHH medulloblastoma growth and
dissemination in mouse xenografts
Having established that foretinib can effectively be delivered in
the brain, we investigated its efﬁcacy in mouse models of disseminated medulloblastoma. Daoy cells expressing luciferase
were orthotopically implanted into the fourth ventricle of nude
mice. Animals with a detectable signal by bioluminescence at 3
days after inoculation were treated by oral gavage either with
vehicle (DMSO) or 60 mg/kg of foretinib once daily, 6 days a
week, for 2 weeks. The weekly evaluation of tumor growth and
dissemination by bioluminescence showed a signiﬁcant

reduction in tumor size and metastases in the animals treated with
foretinib (Fig. 6A and B), as conﬁrmed by the smaller increase in
the total photon ﬂux from luciferase expressing Daoy xenografts
(Fig. 6C). Histologic examination [hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
stain] of brains and spinal cords of animals in the control group
showed a higher number of metastases in the ventricles and
leptomeningeal spaces, as well as surrounding the spinal cord
and the nerve roots, when compared with foretinib-treated animals (Fig. 6D and E).
These results demonstrate that foretinib is effective in
reducing tumor growth and treating established medulloblastoma metastases in orthotopic mouse models of disseminated
medulloblastoma.

Foretinib is effective against the primary and the metastatic
compartments in a transgenic model of metastatic SHH
medulloblastoma
We then tested the efﬁcacy of foretinib in a recently published
metastatic mouse model of SHH medulloblastoma (2). The
authors used the SB transposon system where random insertion
events in the cerebellar progenitor cells of Ptchþ/ mice induce a
very aggressive form of medulloblastoma with high incidence of
leptomeningeal dissemination by 10 weeks of age (2). SB medulloblastomas express high levels of cMET, HGF, and other cMET
pathway activators (Fig. 7A and B). We asked whether early and
continuous treatment with foretinib could prevent the formation
of metastases and improve survival in this mouse model. Osmotic

pumps loaded with 6 mg/kg of foretinib or vehicle (10% cremophor) were implanted in 4 to 5 weeks old mice and delivered the
drug for 28 days, at a rate of 0.25 mL/hour. Strikingly, foretinibtreated animals showed a signiﬁcant increase in survival (Fig. 7C)
and displayed medulloblastomas in the cerebellum with a less
invasive phenotype when compared with controls (Fig. 7D
and E). Moreover, treatment with foretinib reduced the incidence
of metastases by 36% (Fig. 7F) and effectively blocked cMET
activation (Fig. 7G and H). Mice tolerated intrathecal administration of foretinib, although 4 animals presented with intratumoral hemorrhage in the cerebellum (2 animals in the vehicle
control group and 2 animals in the foretinib-treated group).
Taken together, these results demonstrate that foretinib is
effective both against the primary and the metastatic compartments in medulloblastoma, by reducing primary tumor invasion
and preventing leptomeningeal dissemination in an aggressive
mouse model of metastatic SHH medulloblastoma.

Discussion
We show here that activation of cMET signaling is a hallmark
feature of SHH medulloblastomas and correlates with poor

142 Cancer Res; 75(1) January 1, 2015

outcome in pediatric patients. Targeting the cMET receptor with
foretinib, a kinase inhibitor that crosses the blood–brain barrier,
signiﬁcantly reduces primary medulloblastoma growth and invasion, diminishes the incidence of metastases, and increases survival in disseminated mouse models of SHH medulloblastoma.
Our study identiﬁes for the ﬁrst time a subgroup-speciﬁc targeted
drug with promising efﬁcacy against both medulloblastoma
primary tumors and metastases.
We demonstrate that cMET is highly expressed in SHH
medulloblastomas although the mechanisms leading to cMET
up-regulation in this subgroup remain unclear. Of 332 medulloblastomas recently sequenced, there were no recurrent mutations or ampliﬁcations of the cMET gene (32, 38–40). These
results suggest that the high expression of cMET is not driven by
CNAs but may relate to the speciﬁc signaling events or cell of
origin of the SHH subgroup. Interestingly, our previous ﬁnding
that SPINT2, an inhibitor of cMET, is silenced by promoter
methylation (10) and the recent publication that cMET is among
the most signiﬁcantly hypermethylated genes in group 4 tumors
(41) suggest that cMET regulation in medulloblastomas may be
driven by epigenetic factors.

Examination of molecular pathways characterizing SHH
tumors with high and low cMET expression revealed distinct
patterns of alteration. Although low cMET SHH medulloblastomas were associated with deregulation of biologic processes
involved in neurogenesis and neurotransmission, high cMET
SHH medulloblastomas were characterized by alterations in a
number of cancer-related networks, namely cell migration,
cell cycle, DNA repair, and transcription. The activation of
distinct biologic pathways in high cMET SHH medulloblastomas supports the existence of a different cell of origin for
these tumors, in keeping with a recent study that has shown
that a speciﬁc population of Nestin-expressing neuronal progenitors in the cerebellum can give rise to SHH-driven medulloblastomas (42).

www.aacrjournals.org

We identify a gene signature of cMET activators, including cMET
and GAB1, unique to SHH-driven tumors. Our results are supported by a previous publication where immunoreactivity for
GAB1 was reported to be a surrogate marker for SHH medulloblastomas (43). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the cMET
pathway activation status can segregate patients with SHH medulloblastomas into distinct prognostic outcomes. In pediatric
patients with SHH tumors, activation of cMET is correlated with
an increased rate of relapse and a shorter progression-free survival.
Notably, this association is not seen in adult SHH patients
conﬁrming the previously reported clinical and molecular distinction between adult and pediatric SHH medulloblastomas
(44). Furthermore, p-cMET status does not correlate with the
presence of metastases or TP53 mutations, two known markers of

Foretinib Treatment in Metastatic SHH Medulloblastoma

poor prognosis across medulloblastoma subgroups (45) and
within the SHH subgroup (46), respectively. We show that a
simple immunohistochemical analysis of activated cMET provides a high-quality clinical trial biomarker for identiﬁcation of
patients who could beneﬁt from targeted therapy using cMET
inhibitors.
Foretinib had dramatic therapeutic effect in SHH medulloblastoma, both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, our pharmacokinetic studies demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that foretinib
penetrates the blood–brain barrier and is well tolerated and
distributed through intrathecal administration. Foretinib
reduces primary medulloblastoma growth and invasion, and
has also a potent activity against medulloblastoma metastases.
Administration of foretinib to an aggressive metastatic mouse
model of SHH medulloblastoma increases survival by 45% and
diminishes the incidence of metastases by 36%. These tumors
express high levels of HGF, suggesting an autocrine signaling
loop that maintains cMET pathway activation. Previous studies
on glioblastoma have shown a correlation between HGF autocrine expression by tumor cells and an increased sensitivity to
cMET inhibition, which may explain the efﬁcacy of foretinib
(47). Interestingly, we show that foretinib also decreases activation of AKT, a downstream effector of both cMET and
PDGFRb signaling, and recently identiﬁed as a key contributor
to leptomeningeal dissemination in medulloblastoma (2, 3).
Therefore, the antimetastatic properties of foretinib may be
related to its unique ability to target three key drivers in
medulloblastoma dissemination, namely cMET, PDGFRb and
indirectly, PI3K.
Given the high expression of cMET in SHH-driven medulloblastomas, the therapeutic regimen that may offer maximum beneﬁt
in this subset of patients is the combination of foretinib with an
antagonist of SHH signaling. A signiﬁcant antitumor effect was
reported in a patient with metastatic medulloblastoma after inhibition of smoothened (SMO), a critical component of SHH pathway, although the response was transient due to the emergence of
acquired resistance (48). Thus, we anticipate that combining foretinib with a SMO inhibitor may have a synergistic and an antiresistance effect treating cMET-dependent SHH medulloblastomas.
In summary, we show that the drug foretinib is effective treatment in preclinical murine models of metastatic SHH medulloblastoma. Given the dismal outcome and lack of options for these
patients, our results provide strong rationale for repurposing
foretinib as a targeted agent in SHH-driven medulloblastoma.
