ABSTRACT
Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN) reportedly indicated better prognosis
for some cancers. We retrospectively analyzed 150 evaluable metastatic gastric
cancer (MGC) patients who had received first-line EOF5 (combination regimen of
epirubicin, oxaliplatin and 5-day continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil) treatment. We
divided patients into three groups according to the worst grade of CIN: absent group
(grade 0), moderate group (grade 1–2) and severe group (grade 3–4). Multivariate
analyses of overall survival (OS) proved moderate and severe CIN were important
prognostic factors whether regarding CIN as a time-varying covariate (TVC) or not.
Compared with absent CIN, hazard ratio (HR) for moderate and severe CIN were 0.31
(95% confidential interval (CI): 0.17–0.55; P < 0.001) and 0.36 (95% CI: 0.20–0.64;
P = 0.001) respectively with TVC; and were 0.31 (95% CI: 0.17–0.56; P < 0.001)
and 0.34 (95% CI: 0.19–0.61; P < 0.001) respectively without TVC. In progressionfree survival (PFS) analyses, moderate and severe CIN showed similar results. In
the landmark group (n = 122 patients) analyses with TVC, moderate and severe CIN
remained prognostic factors for PFS, while only moderate CIN was prognostic factor
for OS. CIN predicted longer OS and PFS in MGC patients treated with first-line EOF5
chemotherapy.

Identification of factors that predict efficacy in order to
improve clinical outcome is necessary.
Reportedly, chemotherapy-induced neutropenia
(CIN) was a predictor of longer survival in various types of
cancer [4–9]. Possibly, CIN signified an adequate dose of
anti-tumor drugs. However, patients have been receiving
body surface area (BSA)-based standard dosages, which
were established by small-scale dose-finding trials. Thus
standard dosages may be too small for optimal efficacy in
some patients, or too large to avoid unnecessary adverse
effects in others [10]. And Bergh J et al’s study strongly
supported individualized toxicity tailored chemotherapy,

INTRODUCTION
Gastric cancer is the fourth most common malig­
nancy and the second most common cause of cancerrelated death worldwide [1], and currently no standard
first-line treatment regimen for gastric cancer is in place.
For decades, fluoropyrimidine and platinum-based dual or
triplet therapies have been the most widely used regimens
for metastatic gastric cancer (MGC). The combination
of epirubicin, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (ECF) and
its modifications have shown efficacy and manageable
toxicity [2], but only about 50% patients respond to it [3].

variables

with a superior clinical outcome to routine chemotherapy
in that study [11].
Since 2005, we performed two studies—a pilot study
and an extended-sample phase II study—to evaluate the
efficacy and toxicity of the EOF5 regimen (combination
of epirubicin, oxaliplatin and 5-day continuous infusion
of 5-fluorouracil), a modification of ECF regimen. Our
results indicated that EOF5 was an effective regimen with
mild toxicity, and was a suitable first-line treatment for
MGC [12, 13]. To identify whether CIN was associated
with better clinical outcomes, and whether it could be
used to optimize treatment schedules in MGC patients
who received EOF5 regimen as first-line treatment, we
conducted this retrospective study.

Univariate Cox analyses suggested that low/
undifferentiated tumors, liver metastasis, lung metastasis,
ascites and/or pleural effusion, baseline hemoglobin less
than median (120 g/L), and absent CIN were associated
or tended to be associated with higher risk of death
(P < 0.1; Table 2). The hazard ratio (HR) for moderate,
severe CIN relative to absent CIN was 0.43 (95%
CI: 0.24–0.75; P = 0.003), 0.59 (95% CI: 0.35–1.01;
P = 0.053), respectively.
After a stepwise backward elimination of those
6 potential prognostic factors in a multivariate model,
4 covariates remained significantly: absent CIN, liver
metastasis, lung metastasis, and ascites and/or pleural
effusion. Both moderate and severe CIN favored
significantly longer OS than did absent CIN, with HR
of 0.31 (95% CI: 0.17–0.56, P < 0.001), and 0.34 (95%
CI: 0.19–0.61; P < 0.001), respectively. When CIN was
treated as a time-varying covariate (TVC), absent CIN,
liver metastasis, lung metastasis, and ascites and/or pleural
effusion remained significant prognostic factors. The HR
for moderate, severe CIN compared with absent CIN was
0.31 (95% CI: 0.17–0.55; P < 0.001), 0.36 (95% CI: 0.20–
0.64; P = 0.001), respectively.

RESULTS
Patients’ characteristics and CIN
Among all 150 patients, 30 patients (20%) did
not experience CIN (grade 0), 54 patients (36.0%)
developed moderate CIN (grade 1–2), and 66 patients
(44.0%) developed severe CIN (grade 3–4). Of the 120
patients who developed CIN, the highest grade of CIN
occurred during the first cycle in 28 patients, the second
cycle in 32  patients, the third cycle in 21 patients, the
fourth cycle in 19 patients, the fifth cycle in 9 patients
and the sixth cycle in 11 patients; thus 83% went
through their severest CIN within 4 cycles. The median
relative dose-intensity (RDI) was 0.90, indicating good
compliance of EOF5 treatment. Characteristics of the
study population stratified by their worst CIN grade were
shown in Table 1. The groups did not significantly differ
in initial characteristics. The median number of cycles
of EOF5 administrated in the absent neutropenia group
(4, range 1–7) was lower than that in the moderate group
(6, range 2–8) or severe group (6, range 2–8), but the RDI
was higher in the absent group.

Association of CIN and PFS adjusted with other
variables
Univariate Cox regression analyses identified
6 covariates as potentially favorable prognostic factors for
PFS (P < 0.1; Table 3): moderate or severe CIN, moderate/
highly differentiated tumors, heterochronous metastasis,
no ascites and/or pleural effusion, baseline hemoglobin >
median (120 g/L), and baseline platelet count > median
(241 × 109/L; Table 3).
In multivariate Cox regression analysis, CIN
remained significant, as did heterochronous metastasis,
and ascites and/or pleural effusion. Compared with
absent CIN, the HR for moderate CIN was 0.21 (95%
CI: 0.12–0.37; P < 0.001), and for severe CIN was 0.23
(95% CI: 0.14–0.39; P < 0.001), indicating longer PFS for
patients with moderate CIN or severe CIN. In multivariate
regression analysis that treated CIN as a TVC, moderate/
severe CIN, heterochronous metastasis, and no ascites or
pleural effusion remained associated with improved PFS.
Compared with absent CIN, the HR for moderate CIN and
severe CIN was 0.23 (95% CI: 0.13–0.40; P < 0.001), and
0.29 (95% CI: 0.17–0.50; P < 0.001), respectively.

Kaplan-Meier survival analyses according to the
worst grade of CIN
The median overall survival (OS) of absent,
moderate and severe group was 6.83 months (95%
confidential interval (CI) 5.31–8.35), 19.07 months
(95%CI 13.93–24.21) and 11.33 months (95%CI 8.20–
16.94), respectively (Figure 1A). Furthermore, the median
progression-free survival (PFS) of absent, moderate, and
severe group was 3.10 months (95%CI 2.18–4.02), 7.90
months (95%CI 4.94–11.31) and 6.07 months ((95%CI
5.51–6.63), respectively (Figure 1B). These results
supported experience of CIN was associated with better
prognosis.

treating CIN during that period as a baseline feature
adjusted with other variables, moderate and severe
CIN favored significantly longer PFS in comparison
to absent CIN, with an HR of 0.35 (95% CI:
0.20–0.64; P = 0.001), 0.43 (95% CI: 0.23–0.81;

showed no association with OS.

When considering CIN as a TVC adjusted with other

0.24; 95% CI: 0.12–0.48; P < 0.001) and severe CIN (HR:
0.31; 95% CI: 0.16–0.62; P = 0.001) were identified as
a favorable prognostic factors for PFS. In OS analyses,
moderate CIN favored significantly longer OS, with an

Clinical outcomes of patients without CIN and
with grade 1 CIN during first two cycles

patients who received EOF5 treatment as first-line therapy,
showing that experience of CIN predicted longer survival
and PFS compared with no CIN. However, the prognostic
role of neutropenia has seldom been reported in a triplecombined regimen for MGC patients.
Issues about the statistical methods were concerned.
Actually, patients who survived longer received more
cycles of EOF chemotherapy, and thus had greater
chances of developing CIN, hence, considering CIN
as a baseline feature could produce a false-positive
association between CIN and overall survival, TVC and
landmark analyses were approaches applied for fear
of this problem [6, 7, 14, 15]. In the present study, the
two methods were employed. We conducted landmark
analyses, limiting to 122 patients who received at least
four cycles of chemotherapy and were alive 90 days after
initiation of EOF treatment, with the highest grade of CIN

Totally 49 patients did not develop CIN during the
first two cycles of treatment, and among these patients,
30 (61.2%) did not developed CIN during the following
cycles of treatment, and only 6 patients (12.2%) developed
grade 3 CIN (no grade 4 CIN). Those who developed
grade 1 CIN within the first 2 cycles were likely to have
longer survival than those with no CIN (HR: 0.56; 95%
CI: 0.31–1.03; P = 0.060), and had a significantly longer
PFS (HR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.30–0.84; P = 0.009).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we retrospectively investigated the
relationship between CIN and clinical outcome in MGC

during that period as a baseline feature. However, some
patients continued to receive EOF chemotherapy after four
cycles unless disease progression or intolerable toxicity
happened, which led to late-onset CIN. In the present
study, 20 patients had their worst grade of CIN in the
fifth or sixth cycle of chemotherapy. Consequently, such
landmark analyses ignored the information of those whose
CIN occurred after the landmark. Furthermore, CIN was
considered as a TVC in landmark cohort analyses to adjust
the bias of CIN that occurred after the landmark; those
with moderate CIN had consistently longer OS and PFS
in the landmark cohort TVC analyses.
Our results were consistent with the aforementioned
studies [5–9] in which we found the favorable prognostic
role of CIN. The underlying mechanism of CIN as an
optimistic prognostic factor could be explained, by
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that CIN reflected the response of hematopoietic stem
cells to chemotherapy drugs, which depended on drug
concentration partly. Hence, CIN severity could be a
measure of the plasma drug concentration. In other words,
lack of bone marrow suppression might indicate that
a chemotherapy dosage is too low to produce a strong
biological effect.
In addition, severe CIN displayed a consistently
higher HR than moderate CIN in both OS and PFS
analyses, suggesting patients with severe CIN got less
survival benefits from chemotherapy than those with
moderate CIN. Differed from our study, in some previous
studies, patients with severe CIN (grade 3–4) showed a
lower HR than patients with moderate CIN (grade 1–2),
reaping greater survival benefits [6, 15]. Similar with our
study, Han Y et al. reported that patients with severe CIN

Severe CIN might be associated with poor

Despite of the active G-CSF support in the present
study (G-CSF was permitted to use when grade 2
neutropenia was identified), 11 patients went through
grade 4 neutropenia, suggesting deficient chemotherapy
tolerance. This led to higher incidences of chemotherapy
delay and dose reduction, with a relative lower RDI

The question of whether CIN, as a favorable
prognostic factor, could optimize individualized dosages
warranted investigation. The current widely used dose
determination by BSA ignored inter-individual differences
and thus could not always determine the optimal dosage.
Reasons for this individual variation were unidentified,
although genetic polymorphisms that affect drug
metabolism or elimination might contribute [16–18].
Dose adjustments based on pharmacokinetic monitoring
have reportedly led to a significantly improved clinical
outcomes compared with BSA-guided dosages [11, 19–21].
Pharmacokinetic data showed that BSA-tailored dosage
for fluoropyrimidine might result in over- or under-dosing
[21–23]. Oxaliplatin and epibubicin might have similar
situations [24–26]. However, pharmacokinetic monitoring
was not practical in daily clinical work.
In our study, among patients without CIN during the
first two cycles, 61.2% did not developed CIN during the
following cycles of treatment, representing an unfavorable

prognostic factor. Furthermore, patients who developed
grade 1 CIN in the first two cycles had significantly longer
PFS, and tended to have enhanced OS than those with no
CIN. These findings implied that the initial BSA-based
doses could be fine-tuned for patients without CIN in
the first two cycles, aiming at experience of CIN in the
latter four cycles of EOF chemotherapy. A dose increase
could thus be implemented early in treatment for patients
with no CIN after the first and second cycles. Due to the
relative small size and retrospective nature of the present
study, the efficacy of such a strategy could be evaluated in
prospective trials.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
This was a retrospective study. All 150 patients in
this study were evaluable, they were treated with EOF5
regimen in a phase II trial conducted in our center (http://
ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT00767377). Principal inclusion

obtained from all patients. The study was approved by
the Institutional Review Board of the Fudan University
Shanghai Cancer Center.

treatment had better OS and PFS. Fine-tuning of the initial
BSA-based dose for patients without CIN in the first two
cycles merits further prospective trial.

Evaluation of survival and CIN

CIN, Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia; MGC,
Metastatic gastric cancer; EOF5, Combination regimen of
epirubicin, oxaliplatin, and 5-day continuous infusion of
5-fluorouracil; OS, Overall survival; PFS, Progression-free
survival; HR, Hazard ratio; ECF, Combination regimen
of epirubicin, cisplatin, and 21-day continuous infusion
of 5-fluorouracil; BSA, Body surface area; RECIST,
Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors; TVC, Timevarying covariate; CI, Confidential interval; RDI, relative
dose-intensity.

Abbreviations

During the phase II study, complete blood cell
counts (CBC) were detected twice a week. Prophylactic
application of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor
(G-CSF) was not allowed unless patient developed
grade ≥ 2 neutropenia. We identified the severest grade
of CIN based on the lowest recorded neutrophil count.
CIN was graded according to the National Cancer
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0. Overall
survival (OS) was defined as the internal between the
date of enrollment and the date of death or last follow-up.
Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated from the
date of enrollment to the date of disease progression or
death before progression.

Statistical methods
The primary endpoint of this study was the
association of CIN with OS for patients treated with EOF5
regimen. The second endpoint was the association between
CIN and PFS. Patients were classified into different groups
according to their severest grade of CIN. Differences in
clinical characteristics between groups were compared
using χ2 or Fisher’s exact probability tests. Dose intensity
was calculated as the total dose received per unit of body
surface area per unit of time (mg/m2/day), and RDI was
the ratio between actual dose intensity and scheduled
dose intensity. Survival curves were done by the Kaplan–
Meier method and analyzed by the log-rank test. Several
baseline characteristics (liver metastasis, lung metastasis,
baseline hemoglobin, etc.) and CIN were analyzed as
prognostic factor candidates; a reduced model was applied
using stepwise backward elimination until only significant
(P < 0.05) variables remained. However, as CIN varies over
time, CIN was analyzed both as an initiated factor and as a
time-varying covariate (TVC). TVC was identified as the
worst grade of CIN that occurred between the initiation of
EOF chemotherapy and time T > 0. We also used landmark
analyses limited to 122 patients who received at least
four cycles of chemotherapy and were alive 90 days after
initiation of EOF treatment. All tests were two-sided. P <
0.05 was considered significant. Analyses were performed
using the SPSS 10.0 software (Chicago, IL, USA).
