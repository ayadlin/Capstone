Abstract

Author Manuscript

Cancer stem cells (CSC) are remarkably similar to normal stem cells: both self-renew, are
multipotent and express common surface markers, e.g., PROMININ-1 (PROM1, CD133)1. What
remains unclear is whether CSC are the direct progeny of mutated stem cells, or more mature cells
that reacquire stem cell properties during tumor formation. Answering this important question will
require knowledge of whether normal stem cells are susceptible to cancer causing mutations;
however, this has proved difficult to test since the identity of most adult tissue stem cells is not
known. Here, using an inducible-Cre-nuclear(n)LacZ reporter allele knocked into the Prom1 locus
(Prom1C-L), we show that Prom1 is expressed in a variety of developing and adult tissues.
Lineage-tracing studies of adult Prom1+/C-L mice containing the Rosa26YFP reporter allele
showed that Prom1+ cells are located at the base of crypts in the small intestine, co-express Lgr52,
generate the entire intestinal epithelium, and are therefore likely to be the small intestinal stem
cell. Prom1 was reported recently to mark CSC of human intestinal tumors that arise frequently as
a consequence of aberrant Wingless (WNT) signaling3-5. Activation of endogenous Wnt signaling
in Prom1+/C-L mice containing a Cre-dependent mutant allele of Beta-catenin (Ctnnb1lox(ex3))
resulted first in a gross disruption of crypt architecture and a disproportionate expansion of
Prom1+ cells at the crypt base. Lineage-tracing demonstrated that the progeny of these cells
replaced the mucosa of the entire small intestine with neoplastic tissue that was characterized by
focal high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and crypt adenoma formation. Although all neoplastic

cells arose from Prom1+ cells in these mice, only 7% of tumor cells retained Prom1 expression.
Our data indicate that Prom1 marks stem cells in the adult small intestine, which are susceptible to
transformation into tumors retaining a fraction of mutant-Prom1+ tumor cells.
The hypothesis that cancers are generated by rare populations of CSC that are more
tumorigenic than other cancer cells has gained increasing credence1. This has followed
consistent observations that some solid tumors and leukemias contain small numbers of selfrenewing cells that propagate the disease when transplanted in mice3,4,6-8. CSC also
express markers of normal stem cells, and in the brain, exist in microenvironments that
mimic normal stem cell niches9,10.

Although there is an expanding literature to support the existence of CSC, important caveats
of these studies continue to provoke controversy and debate. The current definitive test of a
CSC is the capacity to propagate tumors as xenografts in immunocompromised mice11;
however, it has been argued that species differences alone might account for the selective
growth of subpopulations of cells in these assays. Indeed, the great majority of cells in a
mouse lymphoma were shown recently to possess tumor initiating capacity when allografted
into syngenic mice12. Further controversy has dogged the use of stem cell surface markers
to isolate CSC. Notable among these is PROM1, a five-transmembrane domain containing
glycoprotein that is expressed on the surface of a variety of normal stem cells13-15. CSC of
brain7,16, gut3,4 and pancreatic17 tumors have been isolated using PROM1 antibodies;
however, most PROM1 antibodies recognize glycosylation-dependent epitopes that vary
with the differentiation and transformation status of the cell18, complicating the use of these
reagents to fractionate stem cells. Without better understanding of normal tissue stem cells
and their susceptibility to neoplastic transformation, it will be difficult to conduct definitive
studies of the existence and origins of CSC.

To understand better the identity of normal tissue stem cells and their role in the cancer
process, we generated a knock-in allele in which we integrated a creERT2-IRES-nLacZ
cassette at the first ATG codon of Prom1 (Prom1C-L); thereby creating a null allele (Figure
1a and Supplemental Figure 1). Prom1C-L/C-L mice were born and aged normally, indicating
that Prom1 is dispensable for gross embryonic and postnatal development. nLacZ
expression in Prom1+/C-L embryos that retained one copy of the wild-type allele, was
restricted to the central nervous system, kidney, intestine and developing skeletal system
(Figure 1b). The tissue distribution of Prom1 expression increased with subsequent
development and was detected ultimately in several organs of adult Prom1+/C-L mice
(Figure 1c, Supplemental Figure 2 and Supplemental Table 1). Analysis of nLacZ and
Prom1 protein expression from the modified and wild-type alleles, respectively, as well as
tissue specific markers, detected Prom1 in Nestin+ cells of the ependymal layer and
subventricular zone of the adult brain; Clara Cell Specific Protein (CCSP)+ cells at the
bronchoalveloar junction in the lung; and cells lining the pancreatic ducts (Figure 1c). Each
of these cell populations has been reported to include adult stem cells19-22. nLacZ and
Prom1 expression were also observed in numerous differentiated cells in Prom1+/C-L mice,
including proximal renal tubule cells, photoreceptors in the retina (both Figure 1c), neurons
in the adult brain, acinar and islet cells in the pancreas, and goblet and columnar epithelial

cells lining the colon (Supplemental Figure 2). This pattern of Prom1 expression is in
agreement with recent studies of the Prom1 locus in mouse tissues23, and indicates that
Prom1 expression is not confined to stem cells, but is expressed also in multiple types of
differentiated cells.

Author Manuscript

In contrast to most tissues, Prom1 expression was relatively restricted in the small intestine
of Prom1+/C-L adult mice. Less than three percent of cells covering the villi expressed
nLacZ (n=82/3305), versus 26% (n=106/402) of cells at the crypt base (β-galactosidase
staining, P<0.0001, Chi-square test, Figure 2a and Supplemental Figure 3). Prom1 mRNA
expression was similarly distributed in the small intestine and overlapped closely with that
of Lgr5, which was reported recently to mark intestinal stem cells2 (Figure 2b and c, and
Supplemental Figure 3). Therefore, as a first step to test if Prom1 might be expressed by
Lgr5+ crypt stem cells, we performed concurrent Lgr5 in situ hybridization and nLacZ
immunofluorescence analyses of adult Prom1+/C-L mouse small intestine. Over 75% of
Lgr5+ crypt cells contained nLacZ+ nuclei (n=390/500 cells counted), suggesting that
Prom1+ crypt cells are predominantly stem cells (Figure 2d). Further, of the 4.1 LacZ
positive nuclei (average, range 0 to 8 cells in 210 crypts counted) observed in each
Prom1+/C-L crypt, 23%, 30% and 17% were located at the 0, 1′ and 2′ cell positions,
respectively, that are the sites most frequently occupied by Lgr5+ cells2 (Figure 2e).
Together, these data suggest strongly that Lgr5+ small intestinal stem cells express Prom1.

To test more directly if Prom1 marks stem cells in the small intestine, we used the Credependent Rosa26-Yellow Fluorescence Protein (RosaYFP) reporter allele to trace the
lineage of Prom1+ crypt cells. Two month old Prom1+/C-L ; RosaYFP mice were treated
with tamoxifen to activate CreERT2 expressed from the Prom1C-L locus; thereby
irreversibly activating YFP expression in Prom1+ cells and their progeny. Mice were
sacrificed 2, 10 and 60 days following induction. Two days following induction, an average
of 2.5 YFP-labelled cells was seen in 25% of small intestinal crypts (>50 labelled crypts
counted; Figure 2f inset). By 10 days, trains of contiguous YFP+ cells were observed
emanating in single file from the base of crypts in a manner identical to that reported for the
progeny of Lgr5+ stem cells2 (Figure 2g). YFP cells remained present at 60 days, extended
to the tip of the villi, and included the four differentiated cell types of the intestinal lining:
enterocytes, Paneth, goblet, and enteroendocrine cells (Figure 2f and Supplemental Figure
4). Thus, we conclude that the stem cells of the mouse small intestine are Prom1+. In
contrast, immediately following induction, YFP-labelling in the colon of these mice
displayed the same broad distribution as Prom1 expression, and gradually disappeared
within 60 days. Therefore, Lgr5+/Prom1+ stem cells of the small intestine are distinct from
Lgr5+/Prom1− stem cells of the large intestine2,23. YFP labelling of the brain, kidney, lung,
and pancreas remained relatively static between 2 and 60 days post tamoxifen induction
(Supplemental Figure 5 and data not shown). Since these organs have low rates of cell turnover, it remains possible that some Prom1+ cells in these tissues are quiescent adult stem
cells.
Mutations that activate aberrant WNT signaling, including mutations in Beta-Catenin
(CTNNB1), have been identified in over 80% of human colonic cancers5,24 and this tumor
type was reported recently to contain Prom1+ CSC3,4. Intestinal tumorigenesis caused by

aberrant Wnt signaling has been modeled successfully in genetically engineered mice25.
Although tumors in these animals develop predominantly in the small intestine, the disease
process mimics much of the cellular and molecular characteristics of human colonic
polyposis25-29. Therefore, to determine if intestinal tumors might arise directly from
Prom1+ stem cells, we activated endogenous WNT signaling in two month old Prom1+/C-L
mice using a Cre-dependent mutant allele of Ctnnb1 (Ctnnb1lox(ex3))29 and traced the
lineage of these cells using the Rosa26YFP allele. Two days following tamoxifen-induction,
we observed a marked increase in the number of YFP+ cells at the base of small intestinal
crypts, but at no other site above crypt cell position 4, in Prom1+/C-L ; RosaYFP ;
Ctnnb1+/ lox(ex3) mice relative to Prom1+/C-L ; RosaYFP ; Ctnnb1+/+ control mice (Figure
3a). Two-photon laser scanning microscopy demonstrated that these cells had a slim and
elongated morphology compatible with them being crypt stem cells2 (Supplemental Movie
1). Counting of cells isolated from the entire small intestinal mucosae of mice two days
following tamoxifen-induction confirmed the marked expansion in YFP+ cells in mice
containing the Ctnnb1lox(ex3) allele (P<0.0001, Wilcoxon test, Figure 3b). Remarkably,
cultures of these cells yielded four times as many, and much larger, YFP+ clonogenic
colonies when isolated from Prom1+/C-L ; RosaYFP ; Ctnnb1+/ lox(ex3) mice than those from
control animals (P<0.0001, Wilcoxon test, Figure 3c and d). Thus, activation of Wnt
signalling in small intestinal Prom1+ stem cells induces first a marked expansion of these
cells in the crypt base.

Ten days following tamoxifen-induction, Prom1+/C-L ; RosaYFP ; Ctnnb1+/lox(ex3) crypts
were markedly disorganized and contained cells that were uniformly nuclear Ctnnb1
immunoreactive, highly proliferative and disproportionately Prom1+ (nLacZ
immunopositive) relative to controls (Figure 4a and b and Supplemental Figure 6a to c).
Contiguous streams of YFP+ cells were now seen emanating from the crypt and migrating
up the surface of the villi (Figure 4c). In contrast to Prom1+/C-L ; RosaYFP ; Ctnnb1+/+
control mice, cells emanating from the crypts of Prom1+/C-L ; RosaYFP ; Ctnnb1+/lox(ex3)
mice were both hyperplastic and grossly dysplastic, forming a carpet of contiguous YFP+
cells from the base of the crypt to the tip of the villus (compare Figures 2g, and 4c). All
Prom1+/C-L ; RosaYFP ; Ctnnb1+/lox(ex3) mice allowed to age following tamoxifen induction
succumbed to their disease within 90 days (n=15/15). Sixty days following tamoxifen
induction, the small intestine of Prom1+/C-L ; RosaYFP ; Ctnnb1+/lox(ex3) mice was twice the
width of that of control animals (Supplemental Figure 6d). Gross inspection of the duodenal,
jejunal and ileal lining revealed a thickened, rugous and YFP-fluorescent mucosa; no
regions of normal tissue were identified (Supplemental Figure 6e and f). Microscopic
analysis revealed loss of the normal villus architecture across the entire small intestine that
was replaced by dysplastic tissue, characterized by focal high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia
and crypt adenoma formation (Figure 4d and Supplemental Figure 6f). In contrast, no gross
or microscopic abnormalities were seen in the colon which lacks Prom1+ stem cells
(Supplemental Figure 6g). The absence of tumors in the colon in which Ctnnb1 was
activated in Prom1+ differentiated cells, points to progenitor cells as the source of tumors in
this tissue. All cells in the neoplastic small intestine of Prom1+/C-L ; RosaYFP ;
Ctnnb1+/lox(ex3) mice expressed YFP and nuclear Ctnnb1 and therefore arose from within
the Prom1-lineage; however, only 7%±15.5 (n=36/502 YFP+ cells counted from five

separate regions) of tumor cells retained expression of Prom1 (Figure 4 e to g). Dual Ki67
and nLacZ co-immunoflourescence analysis of tumors demonstrated that approximately
10% of Prom1+ tumor cells were proliferating (Figure 4h). These data are compatible with
the hypothesis that tumors in these animals contain a fraction of transformed stem cells.

Author Manuscript

Our data demonstrate that Prom1 marks stem cells in the small intestine and that activation
of endogenous Wnt signaling in these cells disrupts normal tissue maintenance that begins
first in the crypt, expanding aberrantly the Prom1+ stem cell population, resulting ultimately
in neoplastic transformation of the small intestinal mucosa. Therefore, we show for the first
time that Prom1 marks an adult solid tissue stem cell that is susceptible to neoplastic
transformation, forming a model of a human tumor that contains Prom1+ CSC. Further
analysis will determine if the fraction of Prom1+ cells observed in the neoplastic small
intestine of Prom1+/C-L ; RosaYFP ; Ctnnb1+/lox(ex3) mice represents a remnant of mutated
stem cells that may function as CSC. Our Prom1C-L knock-in provides the research
community with an extremely useful tool to explore further the relationship between normal
and malignant stem cells in the lung, kidney, brain, pancreas and other tissues.

Methods Summary
Mice

Author Manuscript

Prom1C-L mice were generated by homologous recombination in 129SvEv mouse
embryonic stem cells targeting a CreERT2-IRES-nLacZ-PGK-Neo cassette to the ATG of
Prom1. PGK-Neo flanked by flip-recombinase target (FRT) sites was subsequently excised
by flip-recombination by breeding with Rosa26-FLPe mice. Rosa26YFP reporter and
Rosa26FLPe mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. Ctnnb1lox(ex3)/lox(ex3) mice
were kindly provided by Dr. Makoto29. Mice aged 2 months were treated by oral gavage
with 250 μl tamoxifen in corn oil at 40 mg/ml for two consecutive days.
Histology and microscopy
For nLacZ analysis, YFP microscopy and immunofluoresence, tissues were perfused and
fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight, cryo-protected and frozen in OCT. For
immunohistochemistry, tissues were fixed in 4% PFA and paraffin embedded. In situ probes
for Lgr5 and Prom1 were generated from cDNA clones and BC156649 and BC028286,
respectively. Alcian blue and PAS staining were performed on frozen sections following
standard protocols. See supplemental methods for details.
Explants and two-photon microscopy

Author Manuscript

Intestine from tamoxifen treated mice was removed surgically and immediately submerged
in Kreb's solution and superfused with a gas mixture of 95% O2/CO2. One millimetre slices
were placed on glass coverslips and stabilized with overlying mechanical support and
maintained at 37°C within the microscope chamber. Two-photon laser-scanning microscopy
was performed using an Ultima imaging system (Prairie Technologies, Middletown, WI), a
Ti:sapphire Chameleon Ultra femtosecond-pulsed laser (910 nm) (Coherent, Santa Clara,
CA). Images were analyzed using Imaris software (Bitplane, Switzerland). 3-dimensional
images were constructed from Z-series stacks taken in 1 μm steps.

The 8.0 kb 5′ end of the mouse Prom1 gene (4.8 kb upstream of the ATG start codon and
3.2 kb downstream of ATG) was cloned into pBluescript KS+ plasmid by recombineering
from the Ensembl 129S7-derived genomic BAC clone bMQ446F18. The ATG start codon
was then replaced by the CreERT2-IRES-LacZ-PgkNeo cassette using the same
recombineering-base cloning strategy. The Prom1-CreERT2-IRES-LacZ expression
construct (25μg) was linearized and transfected into 129SvEv mouse embryonic stem cells
(Millipore, CMTI-1). Neomycin-resistant recombinant ES clones were selected in medium
containing 350 μg/ml G418 for day 2-3 and 150 μg/ml for day 4-7. 192 recombinant ES
clones were picked into two 96-well plates and cultured to 70% confluence. Plates were then
duplicated, one cryo-preserved and one continued cultured to 100% confluence for DNA
isolation. DNA from all clones was screened for the correct targeting by long PCR
(Platinum® Taq polymerase high fidelity, Invitogen, 11304-011) with primers flanking the
5′ and 3′ homology arms. All positive clones and randomly selected negative clones were
then confirmed by Southern blotting using the 5′ probe indicated in Figure 1a. Positive
clones were thawed, expanded and injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts following the standard
protocol. Chimaeras were mated with C57BL/6 mice and the germline transmission in
agouti offspring were confirmed by genotyping PCR. The neomycin selection cassette was
later excised in vivo by crossing with Rosa26-FLPe mice (The Jackson Laboratory).
β-galactosidase (β-gal) staining

Author Manuscript

To prepare sections of all organs except the retina, mice were perfused and fixed with 2%
paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight at 4°C, cryo-protected in 20 % sucrose overnight at 4°C
and frozen in OCT. Frozen sections were washed in PBS for 5 min and incubated in the dark
in standard β-gal substrate (5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 1
mg/ml X-gal, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% NP-40 in PBS) overnight
at 37°C. To stain the retina, mouse eyes were removed and immersed immediately in cold
PBS. The retina was isolated from the eyes and fixed at room temperature in 0.5%
gluteraldhyde/PBS for 10 minutes, washed briefly and incubated in the rinse buffer (2 mM
MgCl2, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% NP-40 in PBS) for 30 minutes. The retina was
subsequently stained in the same β-gal substrate for 30 minutes at 37°C, rinsed in PBS and
post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight. The retina was cryo-protected in 20 % sucrose for two
hours before frozen in OCT.

(MP, 55976, 1:1000), rabbit anti-synaptophysin (Dako, A 0010, 1:150), rabbit anti-amylase
(Sigma, A8273, 1:1000), guinea pig anti-insulin (Dako, A 0564, 1:250). Two lectins:
fluorescein-labeled Dolichos Biflorus Agglutinin (DBA) (Vector, FL-1031, 1:200),
fluorescein-labeled Lotus Tetragonolobus Lectin (LTL) (Vector, FL-1321, 1:200). To obtain
the kidney images in Figure 1c, the same section was sequentially stained with X-gal
followed by Prom1/LTL co-IF. The same sequential X-gal/IF staining was performed for
Supplemental Figure 2b. All cell counts in tissue sections were performed blind to genotype
and tamoxifen treatment.
In situ hybridization (ISH)

Author Manuscript

To obtain Lgr5 probe, T3 promoter sequence (CATTCACTTTTGGCCGTTTT) was added
to Lgr5 sense oligo and T7 promoter sequence (AAGTCATGGGGTAAGCTGGTG) to the
antisense oligo. Lgr5 template was amplified from its cDNA clone (BC156649) and the 828
bp PCR product was used as the template to generate Dig-cRNA probe (Roche). Probes to
the mouse Prom1 mRNA was similarly generated from its cDNA clone (BC028286). 4%
PFA fixed frozen sections were pre-treated in graded alcohols from 70% to 100% to
facilitate penetration of Dig-labeled cRNA probes. Sections were then incubated in the
hybridization buffer (500 ng/ml Dig-labeled cRNA probe, 50% formaldehyde, 4X SSC, 250
μg/ml tRNA, 200 μg/ml ssDNA and 10% dextran sulfate) at 55°C overnight. Following
incubation sections were washed in degraded SSC buffers and incubated with anti-Dig
antibody (Roche, 1:600) for 1.5 hours at room temperature. Sections were subsequently
washed and colorized with NCBI/NBT (Roche) for 3-16 hours, counterstained with methyl
green and mounted with 2% gelatin.
Culture of intestinal crypt stem cells

Small intestines were excised from each of two Prom1+/C-L; RosaYFP and two
Prom1+/C-L ; RosaYFP ; Ctnnb1+/lox(ex3) mice induced with tamoxifen 2 days prior to
sacrifice, and rinsed repeatedly with sterile PBS. Crypts were isolated by incubating minced
intestines with 3mM EDTA and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ for 90
minutes at room temperature followed by vigorous shaking for 30 seconds to release large
sheets of cells from their calcium- and magnesium-dependent interactions with the basement
membrane and stromal cells. These were collected by centrifugation at 500 rpm for 5
minutes at room temperature. To obtain a single-cell suspension, pelleted cells were
incubated in 0.3% pancreatin (Sigma) in PBS for 90 min. at room temperature. Cells were
collected by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature, washed with 3
mM EDTA and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ and grown in RPMI

Total RNA was isolated from the kidney of adult Prom1+/C-L and Prom1C-L/C-L mice
following standard Trizol/chloroform/isopropanol protocol. 1 μg RNA was reverse
transcribed using the iScript™ reverse transcription kit (Bio-Rad, 170-8890). cDNA was
then amplified using Taq polymerase and gene specific primers for the 5′end of the Prom1
transcript (5′- GAGTCCTTATCTGCGCCATC -3′, 5′CTGCTCCCCAGACTGCTTAG-3′), 3′end of the Prom1 transcript (5′GGATTGCAAAAGAGGTCGAG-3′, 5′-AATTCAGAGGGTCCGCAAC-3′), and GAPDH
(5′-TGTTCCAGTATGACTCCACTCACG-3′, 5′-GCCCTTCCACAATGCCAAAG-3′).

Expression of (a) Prom1C-L (β-galactosidase) and (b) Prom1 wild-type (Prom1 in situ
hybridization) alleles is confined to the small intestinal crypt base in Prom1+/C-L mice and
overlaps with (c) Lgr5 expression (in situ hybridization). (d) Lgr5 (in situ hybridization,
cyoplasmic dark stain) and Prom1 (green, nLacZ immunofluorescence) are co-expressed in
the same cells (broken lines indicate cell boundaries). (e) nLacZ immunohistochemistry
(brown nuclear immunostain) counterstained with Periodic Acidic Schiff (PAS [pink], to
detect Paneth cells) and hematoxylin (blue) reveals the position of Prom1+ cells (numbers
denote crypt cell positions) in Prom1+/C-L mice. Scale bar=10μm. (f) Inset shows YFP+ cells
in the crypt base of Prom1+/C-L ; RosaYFP mice two days following tamoxifen-induction.
Main panel, YFP-labeling of the crypts and epithelial surface of the villi, 60 days post
tamoxifen-induction. Scale bar=50μm. (g) Two-photon laser-scanning microscopy (YFP,
green) through 464μm of adult Prom1+/C-L mouse small intestinal villus 10 days following
tamoxifen-induction.
