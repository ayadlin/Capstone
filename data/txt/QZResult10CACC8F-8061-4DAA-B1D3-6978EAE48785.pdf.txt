BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival in patients with
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage II colon cancer. METHODS: The authors used the State of California Cancer Surveillance Program (CSP) to assess patients ages 18 to 80 years with AJCC stage II colon cancer (ie, T3
or T4 and N0) who underwent surgical resection during 1991 and 2006. Patients who had rectal and rectosigmoid
cancers were excluded. The cohort was stratified according to the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy, and clinical and
pathologic characteristics and outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: From the CSP data, 3716 patients were identified
who underwent curative-intent surgical resection for stage II colon cancer. When the 2 treatment groups (surgery
plus adjuvant chemotherapy [n ¼ 916] and surgery alone [n ¼ 2800]) were compared, patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy were more likely to be younger and to have left-sided lesions with 12 lymph nodes examined.
There was no difference in sex or tumor differentiation between the 2 groups. According to a Kaplan-Meier analysis,
patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy had improved overall survival compared with patients who underwent
surgery alone (median survival, 12 years vs 9.2 years, respectively; P < .001). In multivariate analysis, adjuvant chemotherapy was identified as an independent predictor of improved survival (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval,
0.78-0.99; P ¼ .031). CONCLUSIONS: To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first population-based analysis to identify
a survival advantage for adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with AJCC stage II colon cancer. On the basis of the current findings, the authors concluded that the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival in select

In the United States, colon cancer occurs in approximately 106,000 patients each year and accounts for >50,000 deaths

annually.1 Among those with newly diagnosed disease, 25% to 40% of patients will present with disease that extends
beyond the muscularis propria but without lymph node involvement or metastatic disease.2,3 These patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage II disease have a good prognosis with 5-year survival rates that range from
72% to 85%.3 Nevertheless, approximately 25% of patients with stage II colon cancer ultimately develop recurrent disease, and most die of their disease.2,3
Although adjuvant chemotherapy has become the standard of care for patients who have lymph node-positive colon
cancer (ie, AJCC stage III), the role of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage II disease remains controversial. Previous randomized controlled trials, pooled analyses, meta-analyses, and population-based analyses of patients with stage II
disease were underpowered or improperly designed, leading to an inadequate evaluation of adjuvant chemotherapy for
these patients.4-10 Indeed, the evidence to support adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage II disease has been drawn
from clinical trials that evaluated patients with stage II and III disease.5,11,12 Other indirect support for adjuvant chemotherapy derives from studies that evaluated select clinicopathologic characteristics, including tumor location, tumor

differentiation, lymphovascular or perineural invasion,
obstruction, perforation, carcinoembryonic antigen levels,
and extent of lymph node retrieval.2,13-18 Aside from
those reports, there is no direct evidence that adjuvant
chemotherapy provides a survival benefit for patients who
have stage II colon cancer with defined high-risk
features.7
The objective of the current study was to evaluate
the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with AJCC
stage II colon cancer within a large, heterogeneous population. By using a population-based cancer registry, we
sought to overcome the limitations of previous smaller
cohort studies to determine whether adjuvant chemotherapy provided a survival benefit in these patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cancer Surveillance Program for Los Angeles
County
The California Cancer Registry’s Cancer Surveillance
Program (CSP) for Los Angeles County is a populationbased cancer registry. CSP captures data on nearly all cancer diagnoses, and the collected data are focused on cancer
diagnosis and treatment with the stated aim of improving
cancer care in the State of California. This focus on comprehensive data for cancer therapy (ie, chemotherapy,
radiotherapy, and intent-to-cure surgery) distinguishes
CSP from many other regional and national databases.
CSP reporting for colon cancer location, histology,
staging, and differentiation are based on the International
Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O). The
ICD-O colon adenocarcinoma histology codes used in
our study included codes 8140 through 8147, 8210
through 8211, 8220 through 8221, 8260 through 8263,
8480 through 8481, and 8570 through 8576. CSP staging
of disease was reported as localized, regional (extension
only, lymph nodes only, extension and lymph nodes, not
otherwise specified [NOS]), and distant. Tumor grade
was categorized by CSP as well differentiated, moderately
differentiated, poorly differentiated, or undifferentiated.
Topography codes were reported as ascending colon
(C18.0-C18.3), transverse colon (C18.4), and descending
and sigmoid colon (C18.5-C18.7). Overlapping (C18.8),
NOS (C18.9), and rectosigmoid tumors (C19.9) were
excluded from this analysis.
Cancer-specific therapeutic data have been available
from CSP since 1988; but the first year of our investigation was 1991, when adjuvant chemotherapy initially was
recommended.19 Chemotherapy was classified as negative

5494

(none, recommended, not given, or refused) or positive
(single agent, multiple agent, or NOS). Patients who
received radiation therapy (beam, implants, isotopes,
combination, or NOS) were excluded from this investigation. All patients underwent curative-intent surgical therapy defined by CSP codes 30-80 (partial colectomy,
hemicolectomy, subtotal colectomy, resection with continuous organ, colectomy with en bloc resection of other
organs and pelvic exenteration, total colectomy, total
proctocolectomy, and colectomy NOS). Patients with
postoperative mortality within 30 days of the operation
were excluded from analysis.
Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint was to determine whether the addition of chemotherapy to curative surgical resection conferred a survival benefit to patients with AJCC stage II
disease. Only patients who were diagnosed between 1991
and 2006 who were diagnosed with AJCC stage II disease
(ie, tumor classification 3 [T3] or T4 and negative lymph
node status [N0]) were included for analysis. These
patients were reported to CSP as having regional disease
with extension only, negative lymph nodes (N0), and
without metastatic disease (M0). Patients were grouped
by receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy, and characteristics
were compared using chi-square analyses. Analyzed factors included age (ages 50 years, 51-64 years, or 65
years), sex (man or woman), tumor location (ascending,
transverse, or descending/sigmoid colon), grade (well,
moderately, or poorly differentiated or undifferentiated),
and the number of lymph nodes examined (1-11 lymph
nodes or 12 lymph nodes). Overall survival was assessed
for the 2 groups using the Kaplan-Meier method and then
compared using the log-rank test. Logistic regression was
performed with the Cox proportional hazards model and
was reported using hazard ratios with 95% confidence
intervals to assess the receipt of chemotherapy with overall
survival while controlling for the other factors listed
above. All reported P values were 2-sided, and P < .05
was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
During the study period, 3716 patients underwent curative-intent colon resection for pathologically confirmed
stage II colon cancer. The majority of patients were aged
65 years (66%) and had moderately differentiated
tumors (73%). Most patients (75%) did not receive

adjuvant chemotherapy (Table 1). When grouped according to the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy, patients who
received chemotherapy were disproportionately younger
and had larger tumors (>5 cm), and their tumors were
located more frequently in the descending or sigmoid colon (Table 2). It is noteworthy that patients who received
adjuvant chemotherapy were more likely to have 12
lymph nodes examined.
Survival Analysis
When the 2 experimental cohorts were compared, the
administration of adjuvant chemotherapy was associated
with a significant improvement in overall survival (median survival [MS], 12 years vs 9.2 years; P < .001; 5-year
survival rate, 74% vs 66%; P < .001) (Fig. 1). Univariate
analysis was then performed to identify predictors of survival in the entire cohort (Table 3). Advancing age was
associated with poorer survival; whereas 12 lymph
nodes examined and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy
were associated with improved survival. Next, multivari-

DISCUSSION
The excellent overall prognosis of patients with stage II
colon cancer has made the evaluation of adjuvant therapy
for this stage of disease difficult. The Adjuvant Colon
Cancer Endpoints (ACCENT) registry, a pooled patient
registry of 18 adjuvant colon cancer trials, evaluated the
follow-up necessary to determine a clinically relevant survival benefit for patients with stage II colon cancer.20,21 In
the analysis, de Gramont et al concluded that future trials
evaluating adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II colon cancer should incorporate a minimum follow-up of 6 to 7
years.21 Evaluating our large Los Angeles County cohort
over a 15-year study period, we observed a significant
improvement in overall survival in favor of adjuvant
chemotherapy.
It is not without surprise that previous trials have
had difficulty identifying an improvement in overall survival in favor of adjuvant chemotherapy. In fact, current
investigations regarding the role of chemotherapy in stage
II disease have come primarily from either subset analyses
of randomized trials that included both stage II and stage
III disease or pooled analyses of those trials. The National
Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) has
conducted 7 randomized trials and at least 2 pooled analyses of these trials to determine the role of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II colon cancer.5,11,12,22-24 Each of those
trials enrolled both stage II patients and stage III patients
and evaluated different chemotherapeutic regimens. Several of the trials did not contain a surgery-alone cohort,
and none were powered adequately to perform a subset
analysis of stage II patients. Although the pooled analyses
have suggested that the relative benefit of chemotherapy is
similar between patients with stage II disease and stage III
disease,5,11,12 the lack of a clear survival advantage for the
stage II cohorts along with the heterogeneity of the trial
designs has tempered the enthusiasm for the pooled
results. Indeed, only 1 randomized controlled trial to date
that included both stage II and stage III patients has
reported a significant improvement in overall survival for
stage II patients (n ¼ 468). In that study, Taal et al

reported a significant 8% improvement in overall survival
for patients with stage II disease.25 However, the study has
been criticized for including patients with rectal cancer
and for closing before reaching accrual.
There have been 3 randomized controlled trials evaluating adjuvant chemotherapy exclusive to patients with
stage II disease: the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer
Study Group (ABCCSG) trial,9 the Intergroup 0035
trial,6 and the QUASAR Collaborative Group trial.8
Unfortunately, those trials were either powered insufficiently to detect an improvement in 5-year overall survival
or they suffered from inconsistencies in study design that
weakened the analyses. For example, the ABCCSG trial
was designed to detect a 10% difference in overall survival; and was not powered to detect smaller improvements in survival.9 The Intergroup 0035 trial reported
improved recurrence-free-survival but failed to identify a
significant benefit in 5-year overall survival.6 The largest
of these studies, the Quasar study, enrolled 2963 patients

but was limited by the inclusion of patients who had rectal
cancer with a relatively short median follow-up (<6
years).8 Although there was a 5-year survival benefit of
3.6%, it was exclusive to the rectal cancer cohort and
failed to reach significance in the subgroup analysis of
patients with colon cancer.
On the basis of these 3 trials and similar results from
recent meta-analyses, notably, the International Multicenter Pooled Analysis of B2 Colon Cancer Trials (IMPACT
B2),4,16,26 the American Society of Clinical Oncology
(ASCO) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) both have recommended against the routine use of chemotherapy for patients with stage II colon
cancer.27,28 Despite this paucity of data, both ASCO and
the NCCN nevertheless recommend that patients who
have high-risk disease features be considered for adjuvant
chemotherapy and that a detailed discussion be held with
the patient regarding the potential risks of adjuvant chem-

otherapy with uncertain clinical benefits. Our population-based analysis supports the use of chemotherapy in
patients with stage II disease without consideration for
high-risk disease characteristics. The NCCN and ASCO
guidelines define high-risk features as obstruction, perforation, lymphovascular invasion, poor differentiation, and
T4 disease.27,28 These guidelines, however, do not incorporate other prognostic factors, such as perineural invasion, tumor location, or carcinoembryonic antigen.2,13-18
Our investigation has the major strengths of evaluating an adequate number of patients over a 15-year period
to adequately perform this analysis. This 15-year time period of our study occurred primarily during an era when
the predominant systemic therapy was 5-fluorouracil and
levamisole or leucovorin. We postulate that the observed
survival difference between the 2 study cohorts could have
been more pronounced if contemporary systemic chemotherapy agents had been used. In contrast, there are

5497

Original Article

limitations to our study that warrant reader consideration.
Our study was a retrospective analysis susceptible to selection bias. For example, there were differences between the
2 study cohorts, particularly the disparities in age, suggesting that patients with better performance status were
offered chemotherapy. However, the current guidelines
for adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II disease are inherently biased, because the recommendations are given only
for patients with high-risk disease. Unfortunately, we
could not address the frequency of all high-risk or favorable prognostic factors (eg, microsatellite instability) in
our study cohort. Many patients in our cohort had inadequate lymph node retrieval, as recommended under current national guidelines,27,28 but the identification of
high-risk factors, including low lymph node count, may
not be necessary to direct therapy, as demonstrated by a
recent pooled analysis of NSABP studies C-01 through
C-05.11
Pending large, multicenter, randomized controlled
trials with adequate follow-up, the decision to offer adjuvant chemotherapy to patients with stage II disease relies
on the evidence from pooled or population-based analyses. Our investigation of adjuvant chemotherapy in the
large, heterogeneous Los Angeles County population supports the use of adjuvant chemotherapy to improve overall
survival in select patients with stage II colon cancer.
