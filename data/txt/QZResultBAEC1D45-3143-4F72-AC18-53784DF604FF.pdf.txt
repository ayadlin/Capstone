BACKGROUND. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the role of
amifostine and epoetin-a in reducing severe toxicities during concurrent chemohyperfractionated radiotherapy (CCRT) for limited disease small cell lung cancer
(LD-SCLC).

METHODS. Seventy-six patients with LD-SCLC were enrolled. The treatment
schedule was consisted of two 28-day cycles of cisplatin at a dose of 30 mg/m2
(Days 1 and 8) and irinotecan at a dose of 60 mg/m2 (Days 1, 8, and 15) followed
by two 21-day cycles of cisplatin at a dose of 60 mg/m2 (Day 1) and etoposide at
a dose of 100 mg/m2 (Days 1-3) with concurrent twice-daily thoracic radiotherapy for a total of 45 grays. Patients were randomly assigned at registration to ei-

ther amifostine at a dose of 500 mg or epoetin-a at a dose of 10,000 IU
subcutaneously 3 times weekly (n 5 36 patients and 40 patients, respectively).
Fifteen of 36 patients assigned to the amifostine arm did not receive amifostine
because of a lack of supply.

RESULTS. Amifostine treatment was associated with higher febrile neutropenia (P
5 .003) and grade 2 or 3 nausea (according to the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria [version 3.0]) (P 5 .03). It also demonstrated a trend toward higher grade 4 leukopenia (P 5 .05). Grade 3 esophagitis was reported in
30% of patients treated with amifostine and 9% of patients treated with epoetina (P 5 .059). Epoetin-a treatment was associated with less grade 2 or 3 anemia (P
5 .031) and lower decreases in hemoglobin level during CCRT (P 5 .016). The
median survival times for both treatment arms were comparable (22.6 months in
the amifostine arm vs 25.6 months in the epoetin-a arm; P 5 .447).

CONCLUSIONS. Although amifostine administered 3 times weekly during CCRT
did not significantly reduce severe toxicities, epoetin-a was effective in preventing severe anemia during CCRT in patients with LD-SCLC. Other radioprotective
strategies to minimize severe toxicities should be investigated Cancer 2008;

and 2 meta-analyses have shown that the combined
modality of chemotherapy and TRT improves the
survival of LD-SCLC in comparison with chemotherapy alone.1,2 On the basis of these results, etoposide
plus cisplatin (EP) with concurrent twice-daily TRT
(TDTRT) is currently the standard care for LD-SCLC.
However, median survival times are only 14 to 20
months and the 5-year survival rate is <30%. In
addition, most patients experienced distant failure.1,3-5 Therefore, incorporating more effective
chemotherapy is necessary to improve the survival of
LD-SCLC. Irinotecan has been demonstrated to have
significant activity against SCLC. Encouraged by a
phase 3 trial result that demonstrated better survival
outcomes after an irinotecan/cisplatin (IP) combination as compared with EP,6 we previously conducted
a phase 2 study of IP induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent EP chemotherapy with TDTRT
in patients with LD-SCLC and demonstrated a promising activity with favorable survival outcome.7 The
objective response rate was 97% after 2 cycles of IP
induction chemotherapy and 100% after concurrent
chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). The median survival was
25.0 months, with 1-year and 2-year survival rates of
85.7% and 53.9%, respectively. These findings suggest
that incorporation of 2 cycles of induction IP chemotherapy with the standard chemoradiation therapy
with EP chemotherapy may improve survival in
patients with LD-SCLC. However, this regimen was
highly myelosuppressive. During CCRT, grade 4 neutropenia developed in 91% of patients, with febrile
neutropenia reported in 60% of patients. Grade 3 or
4 anemia developed in 51% of patients. In addition,
grade 3 esophagitis developed in 29% of patients.
Such severe toxicities can have a significant impact
on patients’ quality of life and result in treatment
interruptions, which may subsequently influence disease control and possibly survival. Thus, the protection of normal tissues from the deleterious effects of
chemoradiotherapy is critical for improving treatment outcome as well as patient quality of life.
Amifostine is a cytoprotective agent for normal
tissues that reduces toxicities of chemotherapy and/
or radiotherapy.8-12 It was approved by the US Food
and Drug Administration to reduce nephrotoxicity
from chemotherapy containing cisplatin and to diminish xerostomia from radiotherapy.13 However,
amifostine has been applied in many other oncologic
settings. To our knowledge to date, several randomized trials have been published regarding the ability of amifostine to reduce severe radiation-induced
esophagitis and/or pneumonitis. In patients with
locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
however, the results are conflicting.14-20 Despite

insufficient data, a recent meta-analysis reported
that amifostine treatment might reduce the incidence
of esophagitis and pneumonitis in patients undergoing radiotherapy for lung cancer.12
Anemia is another common hematologic toxicity
associated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy21 and
concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Many patients
presenting for radiotherapy are already anemic and
the incidence of anemia may increase during a
course of radiotherapy.22 Anemia is often accompanied by fatigue and impaired quality of life, which
may interfere with the patient’s ability to tolerate
therapy, leading to a reduction or delay in chemotherapy or radiotherapy dosing, or even withdrawal
from treatment. Recombinant human erythropoietin
(r-HuEPO [epoetin-a]) is biologically and immunologically indistinguishable from endogenous erythropoietin. Several large community-based studies have
demonstrated that epoetin-a effectively corrects anemia and improves quality of life in anemic cancer
patients who are receiving chemotherapy.23-25 Thus,
we added epoetin-a treatment during CCRT as a control arm to provide a subcutaneous equivalent to
each other instead of using placebo versus amifostine.
The primary object of this randomized study was
to test the hypothesis that the administration of amifostine and epoetin-a could reduce severe toxicities
of concurrent chemo-hyperfractionated radiotherapy
for patients with LD-SCLC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

ular lymphadenopathy. All patients provided written
informed consent. The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of our institution.

Assessment of Patients
All patients underwent a medical history and physical examination with evaluation of ECOG PS. Laboratory assessments, including complete blood count
(CBC), renal and liver function tests, and urinalysis,
were conducted within 2 weeks before enrollment.
Chest x-rays, chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans, brain magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) or CT, and radionuclide bone scan were conducted within 4 weeks before enrollment.
CBC was repeated on Days 8, 15, and 21. Before
each course, the medical history and physical examination, laboratory assessment, chest x-ray, weight
determination, and toxicity evaluation were repeated.
Toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 2.0).
Treatment
Treatment was given in an outpatient setting; the
treatment schema is shown in Figure 1. As induction
therapy, patients were treated with 2 cycles of IP
chemotherapy. Each 4-week cycle consisted of cisplatin at a dose of 30 mg/m2 (Days 1 and 8) and irinotecan at a dose of 60 mg/m2 (Days 1, 8, and 15).
Cisplatin was diluted in 150 mL of normal saline and
administered as a 60-minute intravenous infusion.
Irinotecan was diluted in 5% dextrose in water and
was administered as a 90-minute intravenous infusion. Irinotecan was administered immediately after
each cisplatin administration. Approximately 4 weeks

1625

after the second IP course, patients were reassessed
for tumor response and then proceeded to CCRT.
CCRT consisted of accelerated TDTRT (1.5 grays
[Gy] twice daily to a total dose of 45 Gy) plus 2 cycles
of etoposide at a dose of 100 mg/m2 (Days 1, 2, and
3) and cisplatin at a dose of 60 mg/m2 (Day 1). Etoposide was diluted in normal saline (500 mL) and
was administered as a 90-minute intravenous infusion. Cisplatin was diluted in normal saline (150 mL)
and administered as a 60-minute intravenous infusion. The second cycle of EP chemotherapy was
given 3 weeks after the first cycle of EP, provided that
there was adequate recovery from toxicity. EP chemotherapy was administered during the intervals
between the 2 daily RT fractions (ie, at 4 hours after
the first and at 2 hours before the second fraction of
radiation).
Patients received standard intravenous hydration
with 1000 mL of 5% dextrose in normal saline or
normal saline for 2 hours before cisplatin administration. A standard antiemetic combination of dexamethasone at a dose of 20 mg and ondansetron at a
dose of 8 mg was administered by intravenous infusion before cisplatin administration.
After 2 cycles of IP induction therapy, patients
were randomized to receive either amifostine or
epoetin-a. Amifostine (500 mg/day flat dose) was
diluted in 2.5 mL of normal saline and injected subcutaneously in 1 site, such as the shoulder or abdominal area, before the afternoon treatment 3 days
per week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for a
total of 3 weeks. All patients were pretreated with
8 mg of oral ondansetron 1 to 2 hours before the
subcutaneous injection of amifostine. Amifostine was
injected with the patient in a sitting position. Blood
pressure was monitored 3 times within 15 minutes
after injection and again immediately after radiotherapy. In the control arm, patients received epoetin-a
at a dose of 10,000 U subcutaneously three times
weekly during CCRT for a total of 3 weeks.
Four weeks after completing planned treatments,
responses were evaluated by chest x-ray and CT
scan, brain MRI, and bone scan. Those who achieved
complete response (CR), or near CR, were offered
prophylactic cranial irradiation. This treatment consisted of 10 doses of 2.5 Gy to the midplane of the
brain over a 2-week period, for a total of 25 Gy.

Dose Modification
During the treatment cycle, cisplatin, irinotecan, and
etoposide were withheld for 1 week if, on the day of
planned treatment, the WBC was <3 3 109/L, the
absolute neutrophil count was <1 3 109/L, the platelet count was <100 3 109/L, or if grade 2 nonhe-

matologic toxicities were present. For the initiation
of a subsequent cycle of chemotherapy, patients
were required to have a WBC 3 3 109/L, a platelet
count 100 3 109/L, a serum creatinine concentration <1.5 mg/dL, and adequate recovery from nonhematologic toxicities.
No adjustments were made to the cisplatin dose
during treatment. All chemotherapy was withheld for
1 week if, on the planned treatment day, the creatinine concentration was >1.5 mg/dL. Resumption of
treatment was permitted when the creatinine
returned to 1.5 mg/dL.

Response Evaluation
Responses were evaluated after every 2 cycles of
chemotherapy using the same evaluation method.
Objective tumor responses were evaluated according
to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria
issued in 1979.26 CR was defined as the complete
disappearance of all known measurable disease as
determined by 2 observations 4 weeks apart with
no new lesions. Partial response (PR) was defined as
a 50% decrease in the sum of the products of the
longest perpendicular dimensions of all measured
lesions versus baseline and the absence of new
lesions. Progressive disease (PD) was defined as a
25% increase in the sum of products of all measurable lesions over the smallest sum observed (over
baseline if no reduction was observed) using the
same technique used at baseline, the appearance of
a new lesion that had disappeared, a clear worsening
of any assessable disease, or the appearance of any
new lesion or site. Stable disease (SD) was defined as
no significant change in disease status and no evidence of PD. Post-treatment evaluation was performed every 2 months until death or PD. Treatment
for PD was left to the discretion of the investigator.
Statistical Analysis
Using a 1-sided, 2-sample test of proportions, a minimum of 25 patients were required in each treatment
arm to detect a decrease in severe nonhematologic
toxicity (grade 31 [from 45% to 15%] with 80%
power to detect a significant difference at the .05
level). Five additional patients were added to each
arm (20%) to compensate for patient inevaluability,
ineligibility, or dropout after enrollment. Therefore, a
total of 60 patients were needed to conduct this
study.14 The treatment allocation used a randomized
permuted block within strata to balance for patient
factors. The stratified variables included age (60
years vs >60 years), sex (male vs female), and ECOG
PS (0-1 vs 2).

Reponses rate was defined as the ratio between
the number of responders and the number of
patients assessable for tumor response. Duration of
response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall
survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
method. PFS was calculated from the first day of
treatment to the date of disease progression or death
(from any cause) or the date of last follow-up. OS
was calculated from the first day of treatment to
death. Patients alive at the time of last follow-up
were censored on the last day they were known to be
alive. Confidence intervals (CIs) were constructed
using Kaplan-Meier estimates using Greenwood’s variance formula. The 95% CIs for response rates were
calculated using exact binomial CI methods. Means
and standard deviations of physiologic and demographic characteristics were calculated. Toxicities
were compared between 2 arms using the chi-square
test or Fisher exact test for categoric variables or the
Mann-Whitney U test for continuous ones. Significance levels of 5% were used throughout, and all P
values were 2-tailed. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows software (version
15.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
From July 2003 to June 2006, 76 patients with histologically or cytologically proven LD-SCLC were
enrolled in this study; 36 patients were randomly
assigned to the amifostine arm and 40 patients to
the epoetin-a arm. Full patient accrual was not
reached in the amifostine arm because of the unexpected lack of supply of amifostine in Korea. The
Korean Food and Drug Administration withdrew amifostine from the Korean market because of insufficient available data in Korea. Although 21 of 36
patients randomly assigned to the amifostine arm
were treated with amifostine as planned, the other
15 patients did not receive any treatment during
CCRT; thus, those 15 patients were classified as the
no-treatment arm.
Patient characteristics are listed in Table 1. Treatment arms were well balanced with respect to age,
sex, ECOG PS, weight loss, and esophageal volume
received above 2 Gy during CCRT. The median age of
the patients was 63 years (range, 46-79 years) and
the median duration of follow-up was 25.3 months
(range, 8.3-41.6 months). Among a total of 76
patients, 2 refused further treatment after the first
cycle of IP chemotherapy; thus, 74 (97%) patients
completed 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy.

tine and 9% of patients treated with epoetin-a (P 5
.059).
Overall, grade 2 or 3 anemia was observed in 54
(76%) patients during CCRT. The epoetin-a arm
showed a lower incidence of grade 2 or 3 anemia
than the amifostine arm (P 5 .031). The net
decreases in hemoglobin (Hb) levels during CCRT
were also significantly lower in the epoetin-a arm.
The median change in Hb during CCRT was 22.7 g/
dL in the amifostine arm and 21.4 g/dL in the epoetin-a arm (P 5 .016) (Table 4).

Response and Survival
After 2 cycles of IP induction chemotherapy, the
overall response rate was 95% (95% CI, 87%-98%)
with 6 CRs (8%) and 64 PRs (87%) reported. Only 1
patient (1%) had PD at the primary site. After concurrent EP with TDTRT, the overall response rate was
97% (95% CI, 90%-99%), with 31 CRs (45%) and 36
PRs (52%) reported. Two patients (3%) were found to
have PD after CCRT. These results are comparable to
those of our previous phase 2 study. No significant
difference in response rates was observed among the
3 treatment arms (P 5 .843) (Table 5).
As of October 2007, with a median follow-up of
25.3 months (range, 8.3 months-46.8 months), 40
patients died. The median PFS for all patients was
12.9 months (95% CI, 3.7 months-22.1 months) with
1-year and 2-year PFS rates of 52.7% (95% CI, 40.8%64.3%) and 37.8% (95% CI, 27.0%-49.9%), respectively. The median OS for all patients was 24.9

64.9%-85.0%) and 50.6% (95% CI, 40.9%-64.1%),
respectively. When including patients with no treatment into the amifostine arm to match the follow-up
duration for both arms, the survival times were comparable. The median PFS times were 12.5 months for
the amifostine arm and 14.7 months for the epoetina arm (P 5 .666) (Fig. 2). The median overall survival
times were 22.6 months for the amifostine arm and
25.6 months for the epoetin-a arm (P 5 .448) (Fig. 3).

DISCUSSION
The objective of the current study was to evaluate
the ability of amifostine and epoetin-a to reduce the
toxicities of concurrent chemotherapy and hyperfractionated radiotherapy in patients with LD-SCLC.
Overall, neither amifostine nor epoetin-a was found
to reduce severe toxicities in this treatment setting.
Nevertheless, this study demonstrated a favorable
survival outcome similar to our previous report. No
significant differences in OS and PFS times were
observed between the treatment arms, which suggests that amifostine and epoetin-a do not have
tumor-protective effects.
To our knowledge to date, several randomized
studies have evaluated the protective role of amifostine in NSCLC patients14-20; however, their roles are

still a matter of debate. Although 4 randomized
phase 2 or 3 studies of amifostine have demonstrated
the benefit of amifostine in reducing esophagitis and
pneumonitis,13-16 3 other randomized phase 3 trials
failed to demonstrate a significant benefit for amifostine in patients with NSCLC.18-20 In what to our
knowledge is the most recently reported largest trial,
Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 98-01, a
total of 243 patients with stage II or III NSCLC who
were treated with 2 cycles of the combination of
paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by hyperfractionated radiotherapy (69.6 Gy at 1.2 Gy twice daily)
with concurrent weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin
were examined.20 Patients were randomly assigned to
receive amifostine (at a dose of 500 mg) or placebo
intravenously 4 times per week before the afternoon
radiotherapy. The authors found that amifostine did
not significantly reduce the rate of grade 3 esophagitis. In addition, they noted the difficulty with amifostine compliance because of its toxicity, including
nausea or vomiting, hypotension, infection, or febrile
neutropenia. Only 72% of patients received amifostine as per protocol or with a minor or acceptable
variation. By contrast, it has been suggested that
subcutaneous amifostine injection may be more tolerable than intravenous injection. In a randomized
phase 2 study, a flat dose of amifostine of 500 mg
was injected subcutaneously before each radiotherapy fraction in patients with various solid tumors.
The treatment was well-tolerated and effectively
reduced radiotherapy-related toxicities.27,28 Hypoten-

sion was never noted, whereas nausea was frequent.
Indeed, the amifostine treatment was found to be
very well-tolerated and all patients received amifostine as per protocol in our study. Hypotension was
very rare and there was only 1 episode of transient
hypotension reported. Nausea developed more frequently in the amifostine arm. We also found that
the patients in the amifostine arm developed more
severe leukopenia and febrile neutropenia, which
was comparable to the results of the RTOG 98-01
study. With regard to the primary endpoint of severe
esophagitis, amifostine treatment demonstrated a
trend toward higher grade 3 esophagitis. However,
full patient accrual in the amifostine arm was not
reached in the current study, which might weaken
the objectives of the study. The optimal method for
administering amifostine in the context of a hyperfractionated radiotherapy protocol remains unclear.
Although amifostine was used daily in most studies,
a less frequent schedule may be important in the
clinical setting because the administration of amifostine is frequently associated with side effects and is
labor-intensive and costly. One group compared the
radioprotectvie effects of 2 different administration
schedules of amifostine in patients with head and
neck cancer who were undergoing radiotherapy.29
They found that the late radioprotectvie properties of
amifostine on a schedule of 3 times a week appear
to be similar to those of the daily administration of
amifostine. In addition, Komaki et al30 evaluated the
cytoprotective ability of amifostine for esophagitis
and hematologic and pulmonary toxicities in a

randomized study of patients with stage II or III
NSCLC who were receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Patients in the amifostine arm received
amifostine at a dose of 500 mg/day intravenously
twice weekly before CCRT. Significantly fewer
patients in the amifostine arm received morphine to
relieve severe esophagitis than those treated without
amifostine (7.4% vs 31%; P 5 .03). Amifostine treatment was also associated with a significantly lower
incidence of acute pneumonitis (3.7% vs 23%; P 5
.037). Based on these data, we chose a 3-timesweekly subcutaneous administration schedule for
amifostine. Despite good compliance, the amifostine
treatment did not demonstrate any significant protective effects in the current study. Preclinical studies
suggest that protection from hyperfractionated radiation is dependent on the amifostine dose and schedule.31,32 Maximum tissue levels and protection occur
when amifostine, whether given intravenously or
subcutaneously, is administered 30 to 60 minutes
before radiation exposure. In addition, the radioprotectvie effect of amifostine is reduced when there are
breaks in amifostine dosing. Protection for hyperfractionated radiation is optimal when a single large
dose is given in the morning or 2 smaller doses are
given before each fraction.32 Given these data, the
lack of significant protective effects of amifostine
noted in the current study may be attributable to the
timing of administration and break in dosing.
The ability of epoetin-a to maintain or increase
Hb levels in patients undergoing radiotherapy or
CCRT have been shown in several studies in different
tumor types.33 However, the contribution of erythropoietin to curative cancer treatment outcome is controversial.34,35 In the current study, more patients
with grade 2 anemia associated with IP induction
chemotherapy were randomized to the epoetin-a
arm than the amifostine or no-treatment arms (53%
[21 of 40 patients] vs 19% [4 of 21 patients] vs 33% [5
of 15 patients], respectively; P 5 .027) because
patients were randomized at the time of registration.
However, epoetin-a treatment was found to be effective for preventing severe anemia during CCRT in
this study. Recently, a safety analysis in a randomized
trial suggested decreased survival in patients with
advanced NSCLC treated with epoetin-a.36 Although
the rates of thrombotic disease were low, there was a
concern regarding undetectable thrombotic events.
In the current study, no thrombotic events were
reported. In addition, no significant difference was
observed with regard to survival times between the
treatment arms.
Despite a limited number of patients, our data
suggest that the 3-times-weekly subcutaneous

administration of amifostine does not appear to be
effective in preventing severe toxicities in patients
with LD-SCLC who are undergoing hyperfractionated
radiotherapy. However, our results regarding the protective role of amifostine during CCRT in patients
with LD-SCLC deserves a word of caution, because
the full patient accrual target was not reached.
Therefore, some questions regarding the protective
role of amifostine in those populations are still
awaiting more definite answers. Other administration
strategies such as a single large dose in the morning
or 2 smaller doses before each fraction need to be
explored. Meanwhile, epoetin-a adminstered 3 times
weekly demonstrated a potential benefit in preventing severe anemia during CCRT. To confirm the data
observed in the current study, further larger studies
are warranted.
