Abstract
We reported previously that Bcl-2 is paradoxically downregulated in paclitaxel-resistant cancer cells. We reveal here
that paclitaxel directly targets Bcl-2 in the loop domain,
thereby facilitating the initiation of apoptosis. Molecular
modeling revealed an extraordinary similarity between the
paclitaxel binding sites in Bcl-2 and B-tubulin, leading us to
speculate that paclitaxel could be mimetic of an endogenous
peptide ligand, which binds both proteins. We tested the
hypothesis that paclitaxel mimics Nur77, which, like paclitaxel, changes the function of Bcl-2. This premise was confirmed
by Nur77 interacting with both paclitaxel targets (Bcl-2 and
B-tubulin) and a peptide sequence mimicking the Nur77
structural region, thus reproducing the paclitaxel-like effects
of tubulin polymerization and opening the permeability
transition pore channel in mitochondria. This discovery could
help in the development of novel anticancer agents with
nontaxane skeleton as well as in identifying the clinical
subsets responsive to paclitaxel-based therapy. [Cancer Res

Materials and Methods

Introduction
Taxanes are known to target microtubules, interacting with
h-tubulin (1) and thereby interfering with microtubule dynamics.
Treatment with paclitaxel blocks the cell cycle at the transition
from the metaphase to the anaphase (2) and then activates the
intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, as shown by the
reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential, followed by
the opening of the permeability transition pore channel (PTPC). The
subsequent release of proapoptotic factors, such as cytochrome c
and apoptosis-inducing factor, leads to the activation of effector
caspases and ultimately to apoptosis (reviewed in ref. 3). However,
the exact molecular pathways connecting interference with
microtubule dynamics to the activation of cell death remain unclear.
Nur77 (NGFI-B, TR3, NR4A1) is an orphan nuclear receptor
induced by various stimuli such as growth promotion and stress.
Translocation of Nur77 from the nucleus to the mitochondrial
membrane represents a potent cell death signal (4). Lin and

colleagues have shown that translocation of Nur77 to the
mitochondrial membrane changes the function of Bcl-2 from a
protector to a cell killer through a direct interaction with its
disordered loop (5). Bcl-2 represents a member of the antiapoptotic
factors in the Bcl family. It is often overexpressed in human
cancers, particularly follicular B-cell lymphoma. Bcl-2 acts
physiologically as a proton-efflux pump that prevents conductivity
of the PTPC (6). Therefore, Bcl-2 participates in the regulation of
the PTPC and acts as a gatekeeper that decreases the sensitivity to
apoptotic stimuli (7). In 1999, Rodi and colleagues (8) used a library
of phage-displayed peptides to show that Bcl-2 could be directly
targeted by paclitaxel. More recently, we found that Bcl-2 was
down-regulated in paclitaxel-resistant cells and tumor specimens
(9), this being a paradox because normally antiapoptotic factors are
overexpressed in drug-resistant cells.
The present work was aimed at assessing the hypothesis that
paclitaxel mimics the binding motif of the Bcl-2 endogenous ligand
Nur77, thereby making Bcl-2 proapoptotic. The results confirmed
such hypothesis and revealed that paclitaxel is able to mimic the
death signal mediated by Nur77.

Flow cytometric assessment of mitochondrial transmembrane
potential. Cell culture procedures have been elsewhere described (9).
Mitochondria were freshly isolated and mitochondrial transmembrane
potential (DCm) was assessed as described previously (10) using rhodamine
123 (Molecular Probes) and a FACScan flow cytometer.
Animal study. Female athymic mice were obtained from Charles River.
Cells were s.c. injected into the right flank; after tumors grew to a size of
70 to 100 mg, mice were treated with 20 mg/kg/d paclitaxel, every third
or fourth day  4, via the i.v. route. Paclitaxel was dissolved in ethanol/
Cremophor and diluted with physiologic saline to give required concentration. Treated animals were observed up to 2 months after paclitaxel
treatment and were sacrificed when tumor weight was >10% of their body
weight. After this period, surviving animals without sign of tumor regrowth
were considered cured by treatment. Local ethics committee approved the
project.
Western blot and immunoprecipitation experiments. Cells harvested
in cold PBS were extracted in lysis buffer and immunoprecipitation
was done as described previously (9). Antibodies were anti-Bcl-2 [N19
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), clone 124 (DAKO), and BH3 (Abgent)], antiNur77 (Imgenex), anti-h-tubulin (H235; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anticlass III h-tubulin polyclonal antibody (Covance), and isotype-matched
nonimmune IgG (Sigma). Immunoprecipitation experiments were done in
fresh cell lysates and paclitaxel incubation lasted 2 h at 4jC. Western blots
were done as described previously (9).
DNA constructs. Human full-length Bcl-2 was obtained from lymphocytes by PCR with Pfu Taq polymerase (Promega) and HindIII/XbaI-cloned
into pUSE (Upstate Biotechnology). A construct (pUSE-Bcl2D) was made in

which 49 amino acids (32-80) were deleted by inverse PCR and replaced
with a linker of 4 alanines. The construct pUSE-Bcl2Pro39Gly was obtained in
the same way using the following primers: forward 5¶-CCGGGGGCCGCCCCCGCACCGGGCA-3¶ and reverse 5¶-ACCCGCGGCGCCCACATCTCCCGCATC-3¶. Human Nur77 was obtained by PCR from human
testis cDNA library (ResGen) with Pfu Taq polymerase (Promega). The PCR
product was cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI site of pUSE. The PCR
product was then isolated after the BamHI and EcoRI digestion and
subsequently cloned into pQE1 (Qiagen). Nur77 fragments were prepared as
described in ref. 5.
Far Western blotting. Bcl-2/Nur77 protein interaction was assessed by
far Western blotting technique as described in Wu and colleagues (11).
Briefly, 5 Ag of Bcl-2 and carbonic anhydrase were blotted onto
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Proteins were subjected to a
denaturation process in protein binding buffer [100 mmol/L NaCl,
20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.6), 0.5 mmol/L EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20,

2% milk powder, and 1 mmol/L DTT] containing decreasing amounts of
guanidine-HCl from 6 to 0.1 mol/L. Renaturation of proteins was done
overnight at 4jC in protein binding buffer without guanidine-HCl.
Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween
20) for 2 h at 22jC. Drugs and bait proteins were added to protein binding
buffer and membranes were incubated 16 h at 4jC. Membranes were
washed three times in PBST and incubated with primary (anti-bait protein)
and secondary (horseradish-conjugated) antibodies in PBST with 5% milk.
Detection was done by Versadoc (Bio-Rad) after incubation in SuperSignal
(Pierce). Quantitative densitometric analysis of the band of interest was
done with the Phoretix software.
Biosensor experiments and proteins. Interaction analyses were done
using a Biacore T100 (GE Healthcare). Sensor chips, N-ethyl-N¶-hydroxysuccinimide, N-ethyl-N¶-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimmide, and
ethanolamine HC were from GE Healthcare. Carbonic anhydrase, DMSO,
furosemide, and other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Tubulin

preparations were from Cytoskeleton. Before starting the experiments,
10 PBS stock solution [1 = 137 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L phosphate,
2.7 mmol/L KCl (pH 7.4)] was prepared. Carbonic anhydrase at final
concentration of 20 Ag/mL was dissolved in 400 AL of 10 mmol/L sodium
acetate (pH 5.0) after the biosensor was primed with immobilization buffer
and equilibrated to 25jC. Surface of flow cell 4 was activated for 7 min using
a mixture of 0.1 mol/L N-ethyl-N¶-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.4 mol/L
N-ethyl-N¶-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimmide. Carbonic anhydrase
was injected until the target level of 1,500 response units was reached. For
all the experiments, we chose flow cell 3 as unmodified reference surface.
For immobilization of Bcl-2 and Bcl-2D, the sensor chip was equilibrated
with PBS and then activated by injecting 0.2 mol/L N-ethyl-N¶-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-N¶-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimmide followed
by 5 to 10 Ag injection of appropriate ligand in 10 mmol/L acetate at the
correct pH according to the scouting procedure (pH 5.0 and 4.0 for Bcl-2
and Bcl-2D, respectively). After immobilization, 30 AL of regeneration buffer
[4 mol/L guanidine HCl (pH 4.0)] were injected to remove noncovalently
bound proteins. An initial series of buffer blanks was injected first to
equilibrate fully the system. Finally, analyte was injected from lowest to
highest concentrations using two blank injections and one concentration in
duplicate. For immobilization of Nur77, the CM5 sensor chip was
equilibrated with PBS and then activated by injecting 50 AL of 0.2 mol/L
N-ethyl-N¶-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-N¶-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimmide at 10 AL/min followed by 5 to 10 Ag injection of appropriate
ligand in 10 mmol/L acetate. Immobilization of Bcl-2 was done as described
above. All analyses were done at 37jC, and for studying protein-protein
interactions, kinetic data were obtained by diluting the samples in the
running buffer PBS supplemented with P20 (0.05%). The surface was

regenerated after each injection with 10 AL/min regeneration buffer.
Tubulin polymerization experiments were described previously (12).
Computational modeling of Bcl-2. All molecular modeling studies
were done on SGI Indigo II R10000 and SGI Octane 2XR10000 workstations.
Molecular modeling was done using a combination of Monte Carlo and
simulated annealing procedures. The generated models were then checked
for quality using WHAT IF version WHATCHECK 7.0.5, which warranted the
acceptability of the model. The linear functional motifs present in h-tubulin
and Bcl-2 paclitaxel binding sites were identified by using the Eukaryotic
Linear Motif server,6 a resource for predicting small functional sites in
eukaryotic proteins.

Results
Role of Bcl-2 as factor of drug resistance to paclitaxel. This
study employed human ovary A2780 cancer cells and its paclitaxelresistant counterpart TC1 (9). These cells, exhibiting Bcl-2 downregulation, were stably transfected with a construct containing the
full-length human BCL-2 gene (TC1-Bcl-2 cells) or a mutant with
deletion of loop domain (amino acids 35-91; TC1-Bcl-2D), obtained
as described by Chang and colleagues (13). The Bcl-2 mutant
Pro39Gly was generated to abrogate functionally the loop. In fact,
this mutation maps at the beginning of the loop in a critical region

part of a polyproline domain. This mutant was able to polymerize
with Bcl-2 (14), with generation of dimers at low affinity. The
binding affinity was comparable with those noticed with Bcl-2D,
thereby supporting that the mutation Pro39Gly is similar to a
functional abrogation of the loop (data not shown).
The expression levels of Bcl-2 obtained are depicted in
Fig. 1A. Mitochondria were isolated and treated with paclitaxel at
10 Amol/L, which is the intracellular level achievable in patients
(15). The status of DCm was monitored using rhodamine 123.
Mitochondria in which PTPC is opened are recognizable for the
loss of DCm and the decrease in rhodamine 123 fluorescence
(Fig. 1B). In A2780 cells, paclitaxel treatment induced the loss of
DCm. In TC1 cells, with undetectable levels of Bcl-2, paclitaxel
treatment only marginally increased the number of mitochondria
in which DCm was reduced. In TC1-Bcl-2 cells, sensitivity to
paclitaxel treatment was restored and mitochondria opened PTPC
on paclitaxel treatment. Finally, in both mutants in which the loop
was physically (TC1-Bcl-2D) or functionally (TC1-Bcl2Pro39Gly)
removed, the sensitivity to paclitaxel was abolished, with treatments having no effects on DCm.
But does Bcl-2 play a role in the antitumor effect of paclitaxel?
To address this issue, TC1 cells and its counterparts TC1-Bcl2 and
TC1-Bcl-2D (Fig. 1C) were xenotransplanted in female athymic
nude mice and the animals were treated with a paclitaxel regimen
able to achieve a 50% cure rate in the parental A2780 model.
Results showed the resistance of the TC1 model with no cures and
100% of tumor growth (A2780 versus TC1; P < 0.001). Similarly,
there were no cures in TC1-Bcl-2D–treated animals showing only a
slight delay in the onset of tumor growth (A2780 versus TC1-Bcl2D; P < 0.01). The same regimen was able to produce in TC1-Bcl2
cells a 50% of cure, similarly to what obtained in A2780 (A2780
versus TC1-Bcl-2; P = nonsignificant), thereby showing that Bcl-2
status plays a pivotal role in the anticancer effects of paclitaxel.
Paclitaxel binds directly to the disordered loop of Bcl-2.
Bcl-2 and Bcl-2D were immobilized on a biochip. We took
advantage from the fact that Bcl-2 proteins, when properly folded,
are capable to polymerize with other members of the Bcl-2 family.
As negative control, we used Bcl-2 isolated in denaturizing conditions, which was always unable to generate polymers. Conversely,
the recombinant proteins here used (Bcl-2wt, Bcl-2D, and
Bcl2Pro39Gly) were able to polymerize, thereby showing that they
were properly folded and functionally active (data not shown). A
biosensor was used to assess the ability of paclitaxel to bind Bcl-2
and Bcl-2D. As control, we immobilized in the parallel flow path
carbonic anhydrase. The binding of paclitaxel was assessed on both
targets (Bcl-2 and carbonic anhydrase), and the same was done
with furosemide, a well-known binder of carbonic anhydrase
(Fig. 2A). For Bcl-2, kinetic analysis revealed the binding with K d
value of 5.4 F 3.1 Amol/L, whereas no binding was noticeable for
furosemide. For carbonic anhydrase, no binding was detectable
for paclitaxel and a K d value of 2.9 F 0.2 Amol/L for furosemide.
Moreover, we immobilized on the two channels Bcl-2 and Bcl-2D. If
a direct and specific paclitaxel-Bcl-2 binding interaction occurred,
the paclitaxel-Bcl-2D interaction was not detectable (Fig. 2B).
These findings show that paclitaxel binding site maps in the
disordered loop of Bcl-2.
Molecular modeling of the interaction paclitaxel/Bcl-2.
Paclitaxel was docked into the homology modeled NH2-terminal
loop of Bcl-2; during the calculation procedure, either paclitaxel or
the Bcl-2 loop domain (amino acids 35-91) was left fully free. The
resulting binding site is reported in Fig. 2C. The Bcl-2 loop forms a

www.aacrjournals.org

hydrophobic environment in which paclitaxel skeleton is embedded and which includes several aromatic residues (Phe49, His55, and
His58) that establish k-k interactions with the aromatic rings of the
ligand and many aliphatic residues such as Pro65, Val66, Pro75, Ala77,
and Pro78. On the other hand, the side chains of Arg63 and the
amide hydrogen of Leu86 are involved in hydrogen bonding to
donor key groups of paclitaxel. The complete Bcl-2 paclitaxel
binding site shows striking similarities with that of h-tubulin (16),
with conserved amino acids including from Pro65 to Arg68 (Pro274Arg278 in h-tubulin), from Pro39 to Pro40 (Pro359-Pro360 in
h-tubulin), Phe49 (Phe272 in h-tubulin), His55 (Val23 in h-tubulin),
and His58 (His229 in h-tubulin; Fig. 2D). Both paclitaxel binding sites
contain a polyproline cleft together with several hydrophobic/
aromatic residues. Polyproline-containing sequences were also
found in a library of phage-displayed peptides that are able to bind
paclitaxel (8), prompting us to investigate a possible role of
paclitaxel as a peptidomimetic factor, capable of interfering with
protein-protein interactions involving polyproline ligands. Accordingly, the ELM software (17) identified two SH3 domain ligands
(72-78 and 85-91) and four WW domain ligands (53-58, 67-72, 71-76,
and 84-89) in the human Bcl-2 loop. Analogously, a structural
investigation of the paclitaxel binding site on h-tubulin provided
evidence for the presence of two proline-rich domains (359-371

and 272-278) and two LxxLL-like motif (20-28 and 227-231). We
therefore investigated the molecular interactions among SH3, WW,
and LxxLL domains and their ligands by analyzing several X-ray
structures (Supplementary Table SI). SH3 and WW domains share
common structural features: these structural features are similar to
those displayed by the LxxLL motif, in which the first and the last
Leu residues (i, i + 4; a helix) are structured like the interacting
residues Thr and Trp i + 2 (i, i + 2; h-strand) in the WW domain
(Fig. 3A), in agreement with a recent report (18) that the distance
among Ca atoms of residues i and i + 4 on one face of an a helix is
similar to the distance among Ca atoms of residues i and i + 2
along one strand of a h-hairpin.
We calculated the structural features of paclitaxel in its h-tubulin
bound conformation; the results are reported in Supplementary
Table SII. There is a striking similarity among the distances of the
paclitaxel ‘‘side chains’’ (I-II, I-III, and II-III in Supplementary
Table SII) and those of interacting residues in the SH3, LxxLL, and
WW domains. Moreover, the paclitaxel skeleton includes a turn-like
structure around bonds C3-C8 and C8-C9 that is compatible with
both a type I-aRS a turn and a type I-III h turn (Supplementary
Table SII). Thus, paclitaxel skeleton resembles an a helix/h turn
structure in which rings II, III, and I represent the side chains of
residues i and i + 4 or i and i + 2 of a helix and h turn, respectively
(Fig. 3B), thus mimicking a LxxLL-like protein domain. Accordingly, the three aromatic moieties of paclitaxel are engaged in
hydrophobic contacts with similarly oriented hydrophobic residues
both in the h-tubulin binding site (His229, Val23, and Phe272) and in
our Bcl-2 docked structure (His58, His55, and Phe49), resembling
LxxLL domain interactions. The oxetane ring of paclitaxel mimics a

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (17). September 1, 2009

proline residue, and it is engaged in hydrophobic interactions in
both h-tubulin (Pro274 and Leu275) and Bcl-2 (Pro65 and Val66),
similarly to that observed for SH3 domain ligands. However, it
remains a main difference in the Bcl-2 model, because there is
no H-bond partner resembling the interaction between Thr276 of
h-tubulin and paclitaxel. Despite this difference, homology is
impressive and supports the hypothesis that paclitaxel mimics
LxxLL-like and polyproline motifs in both targets (Bcl-2 and
h-tubulin). About paclitaxel conformers available in literature
(19, 20), all fitted into the model, but the best fit was obtained with
the T-Taxol conformation (Supplementary Table SIII).
Peptide mimicry of paclitaxel. To characterize the interaction
Nur77/Bcl-2, a panel of anti-Bcl-2 antibodies was used. Antibodies
directed toward the NH2 terminus and the BH3 domains were able
to immunoprecipitate the Bcl-2-Nur77 complex, whereas the
antibody with the epitope within the disordered loop (clone 124)
did not (Fig. 4A). This result suggests that, as for paclitaxel, the
disordered loop of Bcl-2 is responsible for Nur77 binding (5). To
assess whether paclitaxel was able to interfere with the Bcl-2-Nur77
complex, whole-cell lysates from A2780 cells were treated with
paclitaxel at concentrations up to 10 Amol/L, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments were done. As shown in Fig. 4B, 10 Amol/L
paclitaxel was able to displace Nur77 from Bcl-2, suggesting that
both paclitaxel and Nur77 target the same site on Bcl-2. To
strengthen this result, the technique of far Western blot was used.
Recombinant Bcl-2 was blotted into a membrane. After a process of
renaturation with a gradient of guanidine-HCl, the protein was
incubated with recombinant Nur77. After extensive washings, the
complexes between the two proteins were detected with anti-Nur77

and Western blot. As expected, the interaction of the two proteins
was detectable with a prominent band corresponding to the 27 kDa
of Bcl-2 (Fig. 4C). The negative control of such experiments was
represented by carbonic anhydrase, which was blotted in parallel
with Bcl-2 and was unable to form complexes with Nur77 (Fig. 4C).
Thereafter, competition experiments were done comparing paclitaxel with equimolar doses of 10-deacetyl baccatin III, which is
without significant anticancer effects (21). Although no changes in
the interaction Bcl-2/Nur77 were induced by 10-deacetyl baccatin
III, paclitaxel clearly competed for the same binding site of Nur77,
thereby revealing that paclitaxel and Nur77 have overlapping
targets on Bcl-2 (Fig. 4C and D). There was an apparent
discrepancy between the ability of paclitaxel to displace the
interaction Bcl-2/Nur77 when analyzed with coimmunoprecipitation (effect at 10 Amol/L) and far Western blotting technique
(effect at 0.1 Amol/L). It is likely that the discrepancy stems from
the fact that, in the first case, paclitaxel will bind to both Bcl-2 and
h-tubulin, thereby making paclitaxel less available for displacement
of the complex Bcl-2/Nur77, whereas, in the second case, paclitaxel
will bind only to Bcl-2, making the drug entirely available for the
displacement.
Because the major target of paclitaxel is h-tubulin, we wanted to
determine whether Nur77 was able to interact with this protein.
Our results show that Nur77 coimmunoprecipitates with h-tubulin
(Fig. 5A). To assess whether Nur77 induces the same phenotypic
effects of paclitaxel in microtubules, we assessed class III h-tubulin

(TUBB3) in A2780 and TC1 cells, and the counterparts stably
transfected with Nur77, because paclitaxel enhances expression of
this protein at the gene and protein levels (22). TUBB3 was upregulated in A2780Nur77 cells compared with untransfected cells,
with the same mobility shift observed in paclitaxel-resistant cell
lines. In TC1 cells, which were chronically exposed to paclitaxel to
maintain the resistant phenotype, TUBB3 was overexpressed and
no further increase was detectable in TC1Nur77. Real-time PCR
analysis confirmed that this up-regulation occurs at the gene level
and that its extent in A2780Nur77 cells is similar to that in TC1
cells. This finding shows that Nur77 exerts paclitaxel-like effects on
microtubules.
To characterize the interactions between Nur77 and Bcl-2/
tubulin, we performed experiments using either Bcl-2 or tubulin as
the ligand on the chip and using recombinant Nur77 as the analyte.
The Nur77-Bcl-2 binding was characterized by very low K d value
(3 F 1.4  10 11 mol/L), whereas the interaction of Nur77 with
tubulin was 3 orders of magnitude weaker (4 F 0.5  10 8 mol/L;
Fig. 5C and D).
Therefore, we analyzed the COOH-terminal fragment of Nur77
(Fig. 3C), which reportedly interacts strongly with Bcl-2 (5). This
region includes a COOH-terminal polyproline segment (580-586)
interacting with three hydrophobic residues (Val402, Phe405, and
Tyr406), and its structural comparison with SH3 domains in
complexes with polyproline ligands revealed the same orientation
of the interacting residues. Moreover, residues Phe405 and Tyr406

are located in the H3 helix of Nur77 within a sequence containing a
repeated LxxLL-like motif (Val402-Leu409). In particular, Phe405 is
also involved in k-k interactions with residues Phe478 and Trp481,
which are part of another LxxLL-like structure (H7 helix;
Phe478-Ile482) in the hydrophobic core of the ligand-binding
domain. Thus, the interaction of Nur77 with the Bcl-2 loop could
be mediated through a LxxLL-like domain that could in turn be
mimicked by paclitaxel as evidenced in Fig. 3B.
To enforce the modeling data, we prepared two Nur77 mutants.
The first one was featured by deletion of the DNA-binding domain
(amino acids 1-325, Nur77DDBD) and the second one with deletion
of the paclitaxel mimicked domain described in Fig. 3C (amino
acids 466-590, Nur77DPTXD). With these mutants, we performed
far Western blotting as above described. If with Nur77DDBD there
was binding of Nur77 to Bcl-2 and competition with paclitaxel
(Fig. 6A), no binding and competition were noticed with the
Nur77DPTXD (Fig. 6B). These observations prompted us to design
a peptide reproducing the Nur77 region mimicked by paclitaxel. We
designed two peptides, LVPPPPIVGYF (PEP1) and LVPPPPIVPYF
(PEP2), corresponding to the sequences 580-587 (Fig. 3C, cyan) and
406-405 (Fig. 3C, orange) of NUR77, spaced with G and P as linkers
for PEP1 and PEP2, respectively. A control peptide was used with
the common components of PEP1 and PEP2 but in a random
sequence (PLIPVYPFVP; PEP-ran). In tubulin oligomerization
experiments (Fig. 6C and D), the effect of PEP2 superposed that
of paclitaxel, whereas that of PEP1 was slightly lower. PEP-ran did

not vary the kinetics of microtubule assembly. The same pattern of
paclitaxel mimicry was evident at the mitochondrial level. PEP2
reduced DCm by an extent similar to that of paclitaxel, whereas
that of PEP1 was again slightly lower. Analogously to the tubulin
oligomerization experiments, PEP-ran did not vary DCm. Collectively, these findings show that the biologic activities of paclitaxel
can be mimicked by a peptide corresponding to the Bcl-2 binding
motif of Nur77.

Discussion
Bcl-2 plays a pivotal role in protecting cells from death in
hematopoietic systems, whereas in solid tumors its physiologic role
is still unclear. In an elegant review, Brown and Attardi (23)
reported how controversial is the role of Bcl-2 as mediator of drug
and radioresistance. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no clinical
evidence of a clear association between Bcl-2 up-regulation and
chemoresistance has been reported in solid tumors (24). Instead, in
several tissues, increased Bcl-2 expression has been related to drug
responsiveness in cancers treated with taxane-including regimens
such as breast (25) and prostate (26) cancers. Accordingly, early
pivotal articles reported that paclitaxel activity is inhibited in the
absence of Bcl-2 (27) or in the presence of a Bcl-2 mutant lacking
the disordered loop domain (28). Here, we reported that Bcl-2
reexpression in paclitaxel-resistant TC1 cells xenotransplanted on
nude athymic mice restored chemosensitivity to paclitaxel, thereby

Paclitaxel and Nur77

enforcing the hypothesis that in solid tumors Bcl-2 is a factor of
chemosensitivity to paclitaxel. But how does the drug play this
role? Clearly, paclitaxel interacts with h-tubulin and disrupts the
microtubule dynamics. However, along with this well-known
activity, the drug induces a direct modulation of the mitochondrial
function (15, 29, 30). Here we extend these previous reports and
provide direct evidence that paclitaxel changes the function of Bcl2 via a direct targeting of mitochondria. Bcl-2 acts as a gatekeeper
of the PTPC (7) but, in the presence of paclitaxel, its function of
blocking the PTPC is abolished and reversed, with it instead easing
the opening of the channel and the consequent reduction in DCm.
This phenomenon underlies the paradox of paclitaxel-induced
Bcl-2 down-regulation observed in paclitaxel-resistant tumor cells
and cancer patients (9).
Once the potential binding site was identified in the disordered
loop of Bcl-2, molecular modeling allowed us to characterize the
homology between the experimentally defined paclitaxel binding
site of h-tubulin (16) and the site modeled in Bcl-2. But why do
cells contain at least two paclitaxel protein targets? Similarities
suggest that paclitaxel is a peptidomimetic compound able to
mimic the endogenous ligand of the paclitaxel binding proteins.
This hypothesis was proposed by Leu and colleagues (31), who
discovered that a monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody generated
against paclitaxel was able to simulate paclitaxel activity, thereby
showing that a protein could mimic paclitaxel. Functionally, the
mimicked motif delivers a potent death signal. Throughout
evolution, many species have used similar strategies. In fact, albeit
not chemically related, several natural compounds including
epothilones and eleutherobins similarly interact with the paclitaxel
binding site in h-tubulin. Recently, also the tat protein of HIV has
been identified as a ligand for the paclitaxel binding site in tubulin,
and this interaction appears to play a pivotal role in inducing
apoptosis in HIV-infected T cells (32, 33). But which is the
mimicked protein? Given the similarity, a good candidate could be
Nur77, which, like paclitaxel, converts Bcl-2 from a protector to a
killer (5). This hypothesis was assessed in our study by looking at
the ability of Nur77 to interact with Bcl-2 and performing
experiments aimed at detecting direct competition between

paclitaxel and Nur77 for binding to Bcl-2. Moreover, we showed
that Nur77 binds to h-tubulin, thereby again resembling the
behavior of paclitaxel. Stable transformation with Nur77 leads to
the overexpression of TUBB3, a phenomenon described previously
in paclitaxel-resistant cells. This prompted us to analyze the
structure of paclitaxel, which revealed that it is able to mimic a
peptide containing both a LxxLL/SH3/WW-like domain and a
polyproline domain. Thereafter, we extended this approach by
designing the peptides PEP1 and PEP2, predicted to display the
same biological activity of paclitaxel. The activity of the peptides
confirmed our hypothesis that paclitaxel is a peptidomimetic
compound bearing the same death signal that is delivered
physiologically by Nur77, disruption of microtubule dynamics,
and Bcl-2-mediated PTPC opening. In this context, the increased
levels of TUBB3 in cells that stably overexpressed Nur77 suggest
that TUBB3 provides a pathway for circumventing Nur77dependent death signal. Unfortunately, the same pathway is
activated in paclitaxel-treated patients, thereby explaining why
TUBB3 is a marker of poor prognosis and drug resistance (34, 35).
Nature has done combinatorial chemistry for hundred million
years. This led to the synthesis of paclitaxel and other agents
sharing at least partly its pharmacophore, including the viral
products of HIV-1, which are able to mimic the death message
delivered by Nur77. This knowledge could be useful in designing
novel strategies to manipulate this message, enhancing or
inhibiting it as needed.
