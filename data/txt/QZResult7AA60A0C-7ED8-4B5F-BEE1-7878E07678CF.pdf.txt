The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
Conundrum
Jason A. Wilken, PhD1; Andre T. Baron, PhD, MPH2,3; and Nita J. Maihle, PhD1,4,5

Vogelstein has stated that if the mutations observed in proto-oncogenes are what drives the neoplastic process, they
should then be considered among the best markers for detecting specific tumors.1 Although this concept has become axiomatic, it has not held true for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/human epidermal growth factor receptor 1
[HER1]) or its related HER family members. The essence of this paradox as it applies to human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2) recently was reviewed by Allison.2 EGFR expression, similarly, has proven to be an unreliable positive
predictive marker for â€˜â€˜EGFR-drivenâ€™â€™ malignancies. Extensive analyses suggest that more than just technical issues confound the clinical utility of these 2 receptor biomarkers.
As a case in point, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved panitumumab and cetuximab, 2 EGFRdirected monoclonal antibodies, for the treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). Paradoxically,
tumor EGFR expression does not predict responsiveness to either of these antibodies, whereas mutations in genes encoding downstream effectors (ie, PTEN, BRAF, and KRAS) are negative predictors of efficacy.3 The failure of 2 recent phase
3 cetuximab trials in patients with CRC selected for both EGFR and wt K-ras expression (the N0147 and MRC COIN4
trials) illustrates the urgent need for improved methods with which to select patients for treatment with these drugs.
In this regard, we previously reported the expression of 3 alternate EGFR isoforms, which arise from naturally occurring alternative transcripts.5 One of these transcripts encodes a 90/110-kilodalton cell surface protein designated soluble
epidermal growth factor receptor (sEGFR), which is expressed in normal human tissues and tumors, and also is the source
of the major circulating isoform of sEGFR in human blood.6
It has been speculated that this circulating sEGFR isoform may serve as a sink or even as an alternate target for
antibody-based, EGFR-directed therapeutics,7 in a manner similar to trastuzumab binding to shed sHER2 in blood.8
This proposal is supported by sequence inspection of sEGFR, which contains the epitope (subdomain III) recognized by
both cetuximab and panitumumab. As shown in Figure 1,9 we directly demonstrated that both cetuximab and panitumumab recognize sEGFR using antibody concentrations far below therapeutic dosages. Because serum sEGFR concentrations range between 0.0125 and 5 mg/mL (approximately 100 to 50,000 fmol/mL) in healthy adults and may be even
lower (<10 fmol/mL) in some patients with cancer,10,11 we propose that this interaction likely occurs in vivo in patients
treated with either cetuximab or panitumumab. Given that trough and peak cetuximab treatment concentrations range
from 41 to 235 mg/mL (241,176 to 1,382,353 fmol/mL of immunoglobulin G), circulating cetuximab concentrations
would be predicted to range from a 140,000-fold to only 5-fold molar excess relative to circulating sEGFR concentrations
in treated cancer patients. Because serum sEGFR arises from a cell surface precursor that is ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues,12,13 the effective concentration of these antibodies for the presumed (single) therapeutic target (ie, EGFR)
may be even lower in most patients. In contrast, some patients with cancer exhibit baseline serum sEGFR concentrations
<10 fmol/mL11; these patients would be predicted to receive a substantially greater effective dose of cetuximab. Although
such antibody-sEGFR interactions may be relevant in calculating the effective dose of these therapeutic antibodies in
patients with cancer, we would not predict a similar interaction between sEGFR and small-molecule inhibitors such as

tissues, the potential of these proteins to interfere with the
measurement of EGFR in human tumors/tissues, as well
as the therapeutic targeting of EGFR in patients with
cancer, should be considered in the design of future
clinical trials using EGFR-directed immunotherapeutic
drugs.
Figure 1. Cetuximab and panitumumab immunoprecipitate
soluble epidermal growth factor receptor (sEGFR) is shown.
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were chosen for these
studies because they lack endogenous EGFR expression.
Conditioned medium (CM; 5 mL) from CHO cells stably
expressing human sEGFR was incubated with protein A/Gconjugated agarose beads alone (lane 1), or with 4 lg of panitumumab (lane 2), 40 lg of panitumumab (lane 3), 2 lg of
cetuximab (lane 4), or 10 lg of cetuximab (lane 5). Lane 6
was loaded with 100 lL of CM alone (arrowhead indicates
mobility of sEGFR; molecular weight markers are as indicated). All incubations were performed overnight at 4 C and
were followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis with an anti-EGFR
monoclonal antibody (clone 15E119).

gefitinib or erlotinib; previous studies examining serial serum sEGFR concentrations in patients with breast cancer
who were treated with gefitinib are consonant with this
prediction.14
Taken together, these observations suggest that
serum sEGFR may be an unanticipated â€˜â€˜first targetâ€™â€™ of
EGFR-directed antibodies in humans, in whom it may
interfere with accurate pharmacokinetic/dynamic measurements, and also may moderate therapeutic efficacy.
Moreover, the coexpression of sEGFR with EGFR on the
surface of tumor cells may contribute to the lack of
concordance noted between tumor â€˜â€˜EGFR expressionâ€™â€™
(as it is currently assayed) and responsiveness to cetuximab
or panitumumab. However, it is clear that tumor
cells are not likely to be the major source of circulating
sEGFR (unlike circulating sHER2) because several
studies have shown that serum sEGFR concentrations
actually increase after tumor resection and/or
chemotherapy.15-17
Although the study of soluble EGFR/HER isoforms
is in its infancy, we propose that the expression of these
intrinsic regulators of EGFR/HER signaling adds a new
level of complexity to our understanding of EGFR signal
transduction that is perhaps analogous to the role of
insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins in insulin/
insulin-like growth factor 1 family signaling. Despite our
limited understanding of the function(s) of these naturally
occurring EGFR isoforms in blood and other normal
