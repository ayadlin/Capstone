Abstract
Acquisition of the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) tumor phenotype is associated with impaired
chemotherapeutic delivery and a poor prognosis. In this study, we investigated the application of therapeutic
ultrasound methods available in the clinic to increase nanotherapeutic particle accumulation in epithelial and
EMT tumors by labeling particles with a positron emission tomography tracer. Epithelial tumors were highly
vascularized with tight cell–cell junctions, compared with EMT tumors where cells displayed an irregular,
elongated shape with loosened cell–cell adhesions and a reduction in E-cadherin and cytokeratins 8/18 and 19.
Without ultrasound, the accumulation of liposomal nanoparticles administered to tumors in vivo was approximately 1.5 times greater in epithelial tumors than EMT tumors. When ultrasound was applied, both nanoaccumulation and apparent tumor permeability were increased in both settings. Notably, ultrasound effects differed
with thermal and mechanical indices, such that increasing the thermal ultrasound dose increased nanoaccumulation in EMT tumors. Taken together, our results illustrate how ultrasound can be used to enhance
nanoparticle accumulation in tumors by reducing their intratumoral pressure and increasing their vascular
permeability. Cancer Res; 72(6); 1485–93. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
The delivery of drugs to solid tumors remains a signiﬁcant
challenge, particularly for stromal tumors characterized by an
epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype. EMT is a
developmental process linked to increased cell proliferation
and motility that is important for morphogenic processes that
require migratory mesenchymal cells to be recruited at distant
sites for epithelial tissue differentiation (1). Tumors have coopted this transdifferentiation program for enhanced cell
migration. While epithelial tumors are highly vascularized
with tight cell–cell junctions, EMT tumor cells adopt an
irregular, elongated shape with weak cell–cell adhesion and
a reduction in E-cadherin, cytokeratin 8/18 (CK8/18), and

cytokeratin 19 (CK19; ref. 2). In this study, by controlling the
conﬂuency and passage number, epithelial and EMT phenotypes were both produced from identical transgenic Met-1 cells
(3). Given the low accumulation and poor penetration of
nanotherapeutics in EMT tumors, we set out to test whether
nanodelivery in epithelial and EMT tumor phenotypes
improves with low levels of therapeutic ultrasound exposure.
Using positron emission tomography (PET), we have created
imaging-based methods to optimize and quantify drug delivery
vehicle distribution (4). Classical optical techniques and analyses were used to validate imaging-based results (5).
Nanoparticle-encapsulated chemotherapeutics exploit the
enhanced vascular permeability and retention effect of tumors.
Liposomes, with a 100-nm diameter, increase the therapeutic
index of chemotherapeutic drugs by reducing systemic toxicities and enhancing the drug concentration in target tissues
(6). Albumin, with a smaller diameter than liposomes (66
kDa, dimensions of 4  4  14 nm), has been used in a similar
fashion to carry therapeutics and study permeability (4, 5).
However, as compared with small-molecule therapeutics,
delivery using liposomal or albumin-based carriers is limited
by high interstitial pressure and heterogeneous vascular permeability (7, 8).
Both hyperthermia and local ablation have been associated
with enhanced nanodelivery to the treated region. The
concentration of doxorubicin liposomes has been increased
several fold to tissues surrounding tumors treated with radiofrequency ablation (9–11). Furthermore, mild hyperthermia

has been shown to increase the effective pore size and enhance
liposome extravasation (12). Here, we develop analytic techniques based on the Kedem–Katchalsky equation for the net
ﬂux of solute across a blood vessel wall to directly assess
nanoparticle transport to the endothelium with noninvasive
imaging methods (4, 5, 13, 14).
Ultrasound-induced hyperthermia is noninvasive and easily
directed to the region of interest. In addition, ultrasound has
both mechanical and thermal effects (15, 16) and has been
associated with enhancing drug delivery (17), increasing blood
supply, activating immune cell trafﬁcking (18–20), inducing
mast cell degranulation (21), and prompting macrophage
release of ﬁbroblast mitogenic factor for ﬁbroblast proliferation (22). Combining hyperthermia with chemotherapeutic
drugs enhances the efﬁcacy of macromolecular and liposomal
formulations (23, 24) by increasing tumor blood ﬂow (25) and
sensitizing tumor cells to radiation (26). However, there are
contradictory reports of the efﬁcacy of ultrasonic enhancement of nanoparticle extravasation (27–29).
Insonation-induced tissue temperature increases depend on
the dynamic balance of ultrasound absorption and heat conduction and diffusion in the tissue (30). The resulting thermal
effect on tissue increases with increasing temperature and
exposure time. Thermal dose is often estimated in terms of the
cumulative equivalent minutes at 43 C (CEM43), where CEM43
is deﬁned as tR(43T), with t being the time of treatment, T
the average temperature during treatment, and R a constant
that equals 0.25 for temperatures between 37 C and 43 C (31, 32)
and 0.5 above 43 C. Heat damage to tumor tissue and vasculature varies amongst species with human tumors being the
most heat resistant. In general, treatments resulting in a CEM43
below 0.5 are considered to be reversible and nonlethal (33).
A primary goal of this work is to determine the mechanism
and optimal treatment protocol for ultrasound-enhanced
nanodelivery to epithelial and EMT tumors, including peaknegative pressure (PNP) and thermal dose. In addition, we seek
to establish the use of imaging-based pharmacokinetic techniques to estimate vascular permeability and nanoparticle
accumulation. We have developed chemistries that can be
applied to radiolabel lipid, polymer, and albumin-based particles for preclinical and clinical studies (34, 35). Such techniques show promise in facilitating head-to-head comparisons of
nanodelivery vehicles and in evaluating techniques (such as
ultrasound) to enhance delivery.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and serial transplants
All protocols were approved by the University of California,
Davis Animal Care and Use Committee. Met-1fvb-2 cells were
cultured as previously described (3). Low passage (P9), highly
conﬂuent (120% to 150%) cells produced epithelial tumors.
High passage (P16–25), 80% to 85% conﬂuent cells generated
EMT tumors. A total of 1  105 cells in 0.02 mL were injected
into the 4th mammary inguinal fat pads of donor animals.
Fresh tumor samples were transplanted into the inguinal
mammary fat pad from cell-injected donor animals as previously described (3).

Liposome preparation, MicroPET imaging, and
biodistribution
Liposomes were composed of a total of 10 or 15 mg HSPC:
cholesterol:DSPE-PEG2K-OMe:BAT-PEG-lipid ¼ 55.5:39:5.0:0.5
mol. Preparation and radiolabeling followed previously
described protocols (34). The radiochemical purity of liposomes on TLC was greater than 95%. Isoﬂurane-anesthetized
mice were injected with 1 mg/150 mL of 64Cu-liposomes. PET
acquisitions were obtained as previously described (4, 23, 34)
with a dedicated small animal PET scanner (Focus120,
Siemens Medical Solutions, Inc.). In vivo PET scans were
obtained for 30 minutes at 0, 3, 6, 18, 28, and 48 hours
postinjection. The biodistribution of radioactivity in collected organs was measured in a gamma counter (Perkin-Elmer
Life Sciences).
Ultrasound
One tumor per animal was insoniﬁed before liposome
injection. Tumor temperature was either maintained at 37 C
 0.5 C (no thermal inﬂuence) or increased to 42 C for 2, 7, or
18 minutes using feedback-controlled ultrasound as described
in the work of Kruse and colleagues (36). The ultrasound pulses
consisted of 100-cycle bursts at 1.5 MHz center frequency and
1.1 or 2.4 MPa PNP, with variable pulse repetition frequency
(PRF) ranging from 100 Hz up to 5 kHz. Studies were designed
on the basis of CEM43 and PNP goals.
Histology
Excised tumors were ﬁxed overnight in 10% formalin and
dehydrated in 70% ethanol. Four-micron slices were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or deparafﬁnized for
immunohistochemistry with the following antibodies: CD31
(Santa Cruz, sc-1506, 1:800), E-cadherin (Abcam, ab53033,
1:1200), N-cadherin (Epitomics, 2019-1, 1:800), CK8/18 (Fitzgerald/RDI, 20R-CP004, 1:8000), CK19 (Epitomics, 3863-1,
1:1000), and vimentin (Epitomics, 2707-1, 1:1000).
Tumor interstitial pressure
Pressure was measured with the wick-in needle method
using a 25G needle with a side hole as previously described (37).
Transcapillary transport of albumin
The 30 minute clearance of ﬂuorescently labeled albumin
was measured as described in detail elsewhere (5, 38). The
tissue was dried over 3 days in an oven to obtain a dry weight
measurement.
Statistics
A total of 123 animals with bilateral tumors were studied.

CA). The maximum accumulation over time and time–activity
data acquired over multiple time points was analyzed using a
linear mixed model including repeated measures. When analyzing the effect of ultrasound on epithelial and EMT tumors,
multiple comparisons were conducted using the Turkey honest signiﬁcant difference test with a repeated measures mixed
model. Least squares means were calculated to test for differences between paired, treated, and control animals after a
global F test. A minimum of 7 animals per group were studied
with some groups including more than 7 since tumor characterization was not carried out until histology was evaluated.

Characterizing tumor phenotypes
To differentiate tumor phenotypes, we ﬁrst characterized
epithelial and EMT tumors based on H&E staining for gross
anatomy and 5 immunohistochemical markers (E-cadherin,
N-cadherin, CK8/18, CK19, and vimentin). Epithelial tumors
showed a well-deﬁned margin (Fig. 1A) that displaced the
host tissue during proliferation and contained large diameter vascular sinuses and vessels (Fig. 1B). EMT Met-1
tumors were highly invasive (Fig. 1C) with a reduced vascular volume (43.7  15.0 mL/g tissue), as compared with
epithelial tumors (107.4  111.6 mL/g tissue, P < 0.02) and the
quadriceps muscle (24.5  9.2 mL/g dry tissue, P < 5.0 
105; Fig. 1D and E). The positivity (N positive/N total) of the
immunohistochemical stains was evaluated to determine

protein prevalence (Fig. 2A–M). Epithelial tumors (Fig. 2A–
F) were characterized by the presence of high levels of
E-cadherin, CK8/18, and CK19 expression (0.63  0.01,
0.65  0.06, and 0.32  0.09, respectively) with low vimentin
expression levels (0.28  0.07). N-cadherin was highly
expressed in both tumor phenotypes (0.68  0.02 and 0.64
 0.02) but was bound to the plasma membrane in epithelial
tumors versus cytoplasmic in EMT tumors. Vimentin was
upregulated in EMT tumors (0.58  0.09), while E-cadherin,
CK8/18, and CK19 levels fell below the 20% detection
threshold (Fig. 2G–L).
The accumulation of liposomal particles differed between
epithelial (N ¼ 39) and EMT (N ¼ 58) phenotypes. In the
absence of ultrasound, liposomal accumulation was greater in
epithelial (8.2%  3.6% ID/g) than EMT tumors (5.5%  2.0%
ID/g, P < 3.0  106; Fig. 2N). The time required for maximum
accumulation was longer for epithelial tumors (30.3  9.0
hours) than EMT tumors (23.5  9.0 hours, P < 0.0005; Fig. 2N).
MicroPET imaging of 64Cu-labeled liposomal particles
after tumor insonation
Baseline levels of liposomal accumulation were ﬁrst
assessed in both epithelial and EMT tumor phenotypes. Ultrasound was then applied to induce mild hyperthermia and
mechanical stress, with a goal of increasing the transport
through the endothelium and thus increasing accumulation
(Fig. 3A and B). Over the ﬁrst 18 hours after intravenous
injection, radiolabeled liposomes were highly concentrated
within the blood pool, evident in the images within the heart
chambers and major blood vessels (Fig. 3C). Within 18 hours,
liposome accumulation in tumors was observed and accumulation was greatest for the insoniﬁed tumor (Fig. 3C, red arrow).
Through region of interest analysis and biodistribution data
(Supplementary Fig. S1), the increased accumulation of particles within the insoniﬁed tumor was quantiﬁed (Fig. 3D),
validating the enhanced accumulation in the insoniﬁed
tumors. Across EMT and epithelial tumors (N ¼ 97), therapeutic ultrasound treatment resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in
liposomal particle accumulation over control tumors (Fig. 3C
and D; P < 0.001). For these long circulating particles, tumor
accumulation peaked between 18 and 28 hours (Fig. 3D) with
particle clearance occurring through liver metabolism and
urinary and intestinal excretion. Both the maximum accumulation over time and the accumulation at the ﬁnal 48-hour time
point increased in insoniﬁed (as compared with control)
tumors. Accumulation was greatest when the particles were
injected within 1 hour of ultrasound treatment (8.5%  2.8%
ID/g) as compared with injection times exceeding 1 hour after
insonation (6.9%  3.1% ID/g, P < 0.01, N ¼ 11 for both <1 and
>1 hour; Fig. 3E).
The effect of ultrasound differed with both thermal and
mechanical ultrasound dose. Increasing the thermal ultrasound dose (CEM43) from less than 1 to 4.5 enhanced the
accumulation of particles in EMT tumors (5.3%  1.8%, 5.3% 
2.6%, 6.1%  1.8%, 8.0%  4.1%, 9.2%  3.0% ID/g tumor for a
CEM43 of 0, <1, 1.4, 1.6, and 4.5, respectively). Accumulation in
epithelial tumors peaked at approximately 15% ID/cc with
CEM43 of 1.4 and a PNP of 1.1 MPa (Figs. 4A and B, 5A). When

ultrasound with a PNP of 2.4 MPa was applied with the tumor
temperature remaining within 0.5 C of 37 C, accumulation
was not increased in the group tested (EMT tumors; 5.6% 
1.7% vs. 5.3%  2.6% ID/g; Fig. 5B).
The rate of particle extravasation was then evaluated
using an image-driven pharmacokinetic model with transport
between the vasculature and tumor estimated over the ﬁrst
28 hours after insonation and injection. Apparent permeability
(PAP) is a measure of particle transport, combining convective
and diffusive transport through modiﬁed intercellular junctions and specialized transendothelial pathways such as
transendothelial gaps and vesiculo-vacuolar organelles (13).
Averaged across all insonation parameters, for both epithelial
and EMT tumors, transport was increased by approximately
73% with insonation. For epithelial tumors, PAP increased from
4.1  108  2.8  108 to 6.7  108  4.6  108 cm/s (Fig.
5C, P < 0.001). PAP in EMT tumors was signiﬁcantly lower than
in epithelial tumors prior to insonation (2.7  108  1.4 
108 cm/s, P < 0.005); however, insonation increased PAP to 5.1
 108  3.6  108 cm/s (P < 1.0  105). A general trend of
increasing PAP with increasing CEM43 for EMT tumors was
observed with R2 ¼ 0.93 (Fig. 5D).

stitium (Fig. 6A and C). Intratumoral pressure in control
tumors averaged 13.6  5.4 mm Hg. As the tumor was heated
from body temperature (37 C) to 42 C, intratumoral pressure
was unchanged (control pressure normalized to 1 vs. 0.95 
0.19). When tumor temperature was maintained at 42 C and
insonation continued for 5 minutes (CEM43 1.4, PNP 2.4
MPa) in a live animal, intratumoral pressure declined (1 vs. 0.82
 0.24, P < 0.02, N ¼ 15). As expected, intratumoral pressure fell
after euthanasia (from 1 to 0.84  0.084, P < 0.005; Fig. 6B).
Tumor insonation after euthanasia also resulted in an intratumoral pressure reduction; a signiﬁcant change was not
observed during the 37 C to 42 C incline, but intratumoral
pressure dropped during a 5 minute insonation at 42 C (from
0.84  0.084 to 0.76  0.11, P < 0.05, N ¼ 7).
For comparison with classical permeability studies, the
clearance of ﬂuorescently labeled albumin was evaluated
before and after insonation (Fig. 6C). The 30-minute clearance
of albumin from the tumor vasculature into the tumor interstitium was faster in insoniﬁed (85.5  40.6 mL/g dry tissue)
than control tumors (64.9  33.8 mL/g dry tissue, P < 0.001, N ¼
18) and greater than quadriceps muscle clearance (8.6  3.1
mL/g dry tissue). Intratumoral water content did not change
after ultrasound (Fig. 6D, N ¼ 19), but exceeded that obtained
from the quadriceps muscle (4.2  0.4 mL/g), collected as an
internal control.

Discussion
The use of ultrasound to enhance the extravasation of
drugs and nanoparticles has been widely reported; however,
reports of signiﬁcant enhancements have been accompanied

Figure 4. Time–activity curves for epithelial (A) and EMT (B) tumors as a

no statistical differences among groups for epithelial tumors. However,
there was signiﬁcant difference between <1 and 4.5 CEM43 for EMT
tumors ( , P < 0.02).

Without ultrasound, we found that the accumulation of
liposomes was approximately 1.5 times greater in epithelial, as
compared with EMT, tumors. When ultrasound was applied
within 1 hour of particle injection, accumulation was enhanced
in the insoniﬁed, as compared with the contralateral, tumor
with a concomitant increase in both the rate and volume of
accumulation. Across both epithelial and EMT tumors, maximum and mean accumulation in the tumor interstitium were
increased in the insoniﬁed tumors. The effect of ultrasound
differed with both thermal and mechanical ultrasound indices.
Increasing the CEM43 from 1.6 to 4.5 increased the accumulation of particles in EMT tumors to a maximum of 9.2%  3.0%
ID/g for a CEM43 of 4.5, whereas accumulation peaked in
epithelial tumors at 14.7%  3.0% ID/g. Given the narrow
therapeutic window for current chemotherapeutics, this
increase in tumor accumulation could signiﬁcantly improve
efﬁcacy.

Figure 5. Ultrasonic enhancement of accumulation in epithelial and EMT tumors. A, epithelial accumulation was greatest with a CEM43 of 1.4, although
accumulation also increased (as compared with control) with a CEM43 of 1.6 and less than 1. Enhanced accumulation was achieved for EMT tumors at a
CEM43 of 1.6 and 4.5. A PNP of 1.1 MPa did not increase accumulation in EMT tumors for a CEM43 below 1.4. Statistical signiﬁcance was tested
against no ultrasound, contralateral control tumors (not shown). Table shown below plot (A) summarizes percentage of increase in accumulation
relative to control. B, in EMT tumors, insonation without a concomitant increase in temperature did not signiﬁcantly increase particle accumulation as
compared with a no ultrasound control. In the legend, "mechanical" indicates insonation with a PNP of 2.4 MPa for 35 minutes, achieving a temperature
increase below 0.5 C. C, without insonation (shown here as control), PAP was signiﬁcantly higher for epithelial, as compared with EMT, tumors.
Insonation signiﬁcantly increased PAP in both epithelial and EMT tumors. D, EMT tumors show a linear increase in PAP with increasing CEM43,
R2 ¼ 0.93. ( , P < 0.05;  , P < 0.02;   , P < 0.005; þ, P < 0.001; and þþ, P < 1.0  105).

Enhanced delivery to the EMT phenotype is of particular
interest as such tumors are aggressive and frequently difﬁcult
to treat (39). Here, a signiﬁcant enhancement of accumulation
was observed in both the EMT and epithelial models, yet the
parameters required to maximize the effect differed with the
tumor biology. Accumulation increased in both EMT and
epithelial tumors with a PNP of 2.4 MPa; however, a greater
thermal dose decreased accumulation in epithelial tumors.
The mean vascular volume in epithelial tumors was more than
double that in the EMT phenotype. We hypothesize that the
decreased accumulation in epithelial tumors with a higher
thermal dose results from vascular stasis in the large vessels
that are prevalent in the epithelial (but not EMT) phenotype
(12). On the contrary, accumulation in the EMT phenotype was
greatest at the highest thermal dose evaluated here, where
small regions of heat-mediated necrosis were evident. For EMT
tumors, the proportional increase in transport with increasing
CEM43 likely results from decreased interstitial pressure,
increased PAP, and cell damage (40).
Mechanical effects of ultrasound stem from multiple
sources, including cavitation, radiation pressure, and expansion and contraction of space between lipid membrane
bilayers (41). Potential beneﬁts of leaﬂet stretching include

stimulation of mechanosensitive membrane proteins, rearrangement of cytoskeletal elements, membrane perforation
increasing drug uptake, and increased tissue permeability (42).
As shown in Fig. 5A, accumulation was enhanced in epithelial
tumors at a PNP of 1.1 and 2.4 MPa; however, accumulation
was not maximized in EMT tumors until a PNP of 2.4 MPa was
applied. Following the transformation of Met-1 cells from
an epithelial to an EMT phenotype, we observed downregulation of E-cadherin, CK8/18, and CK19 expression but upregulation of vimentin. E-cadherin expression is important for
maintaining cell–cell contacts and tissue organization (43,
44). Vimentin has a number of critical functions within the
cell that involve attachment, migration, and cell signaling (45).
In addition, vimentin modulates the negative effects of
mechanical and thermal stresses (46, 47). Our results suggest
that imposing a mechanical stress by ultrasound (in addition to
heat) enhances accumulation in the EMT phenotype, presumably due to weakened cell–cell adhesion and increased vimentin expression.
The mechanisms for the effect of ultrasound on PAP and
particle accumulation were also investigated. First, techniques
for the estimation of vascular volume, clearance rate, and water
content were validated by measurements for the quadriceps

muscle (internal control), where values were similar to those
previously reported for C57BL/6 mice (5, 38). Ultrasound
reduced the intratumoral pressure and increased PAP in our
tumor model without signiﬁcant alterations to vascular volume and tissue water content. The measured changes in these
2 parameters likely contributed to the enhanced accumulation
of particles within the tumor. Interestingly, ultrasound reduced
intratumoral pressure even after euthanasia; therefore, the
effect cannot be solely attributed to changes in blood ﬂow,
protein expression, or macrophage recruitment. We hypothesize that this reduction is likely due to the effect of insonation
and hyperthermia on the extracellular matrix and will evaluate
this effect further in future studies. Thermal absorption and
mechanical agitation can inﬂuence the extracellular matrix,
particularly collagen integrity (48). Also, collagen content is
known to inﬂuence extracellular matrix hydraulic conductivity
(49).
PET provided a convenient method to assess the accumulation and apparent vascular permeability over time and across
the tumor volume; such measurements can be directly compared with classical estimates of vascular clearance. PET-based
pharmacokinetic modeling has previously been developed for
small-molecule therapeutics, but nuclear medicine–driven
techniques to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of nanoparticles
are currently unavailable. While small molecules distribute in
seconds to minutes, nanoparticles extravasate from the blood
pool in hours to tens of hours, and therefore, nanoparticle
distribution at the time of injection provides a direct measurement of organ and tumor vascular volume. With PET, the
circulating radioactivity can be measured on the basis of
cardiac chamber activity. With estimates of circulating particle
concentration and tumor vascular volume, PET can be applied
to estimate the rate of nanoparticle extravasation for each
acquisition.

In our Supplementary information, we detail the relationship between the PAP parameter derived through the imageguided model with the classical parameters of solute transport
coefﬁcient, clearance, and 30-minute albumin clearance (Cl30).
PAP and Cl30 are related as described by SI Eq6,
Cl30 r
PAP ¼
1800 2hVT
where VT is the tumor volume, r is the mean radius of the blood
vessels within the tumor, and h is the plasma volume fraction in
the tumor. In our study, both the PAP (as determined by PET) and
the clearance (as determined by ﬂuorescent albumin tracers)
were increased as a result of ultrasound. Not surprisingly,
because of the difference in diameter, the ultrasound-induced
increase in PAP for liposomes was greater than the induced
increase in clearance for albumin (30% increase in Cl30 for
albumin and 70% increase in PAP for liposomes as assessed by
PET, averaged across epithelial and EMT tumors). One limitation of these studies is that we were not able to determine
whether the net ﬂux of solute into the tumor interstitium was
due to increased extravasation or a decrease in the net clearance
from the tumor. Regardless of the mechanism, both albumin
clearance and PET imaging of liposomes assess net ﬂux of solute
between the tumor vasculature and interstitium and showed the
effectiveness of ultrasound to enhance accumulation. A further
limitation is that we selected one peak treatment temperature to
study (42 C) and the optimal protocol is expected to vary with
changes in this treatment temperature.
In summary, we applied ultrasound to increase nanoparticle-based drug extravasation and accumulation in both epithelial and EMT tumors. Using both the thermal and mechanical properties of ultrasound, effective treatment times were

shorter than times typically used in mild hyperthermia treatments (5–18 minutes compared with durations of 1 hours). In
addition, we observed a decrease in intratumoral pressure after
only 5 minutes as compared with the reported 6 hours required
for interstitial ﬂuid pressure reduction with whole body hyperthermia (50). Our study clearly shows that differences in tumor
phenotype must be recognized in treatment planning and
suggests that imaging techniques, such as those applied here,
may provide the information required to optimize treatment
for individual characteristics. Such individual differences can
be viewed as an opportunity or obstacle for such treatments.
For our ultrasound treatment parameters and a target temperature of 42 C, thermal dose must be limited when treating
highly vascular epithelial tumors; whereas delivery can be
increased in the poorly vascularized EMT phenotype with a
higher mechanical and thermal dose.
