ABSTRACT
The importance of tumor microenvironment (TME) as a relevant contributor
to cancer progression and its role in the development of de novo resistance to
targeted therapies has become increasingly apparent. However, the mechanisms
of microenvironment-mediated drug resistance for nonspecific conventional
chemotherapeutic agents, such as platinum compounds or antimetabolites, are still
unclear.
Here we describe a mechanism induced by soluble factors released by carcinomaassociated fibroblasts (CAFs) that induce the translocation of AKT, Survivin and P38
to the nucleus of tumor cells. These changes are guided to ensure DNA repair and
the correct entrance and exit from mitosis in the presence of chemotherapy. We
used conditioned media (CM) from normal-colonic fibroblasts and paired CAFs to
assess dose response curves of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil, separately or combined,
compared with standard culture medium. We also evaluated a colony-forming assay
and cell death to demonstrate the protective role of CAF-CM. Immunofluorescence
confirmed the translocation of AKT, P38 and Survivin to the nucleus induced by CAFsoluble factors. We also have shown that STAT3 or P38 inhibition provides a promising
strategy for overcoming microenvironment-mediated resistance. Conversely,
pharmacologic AKT inhibition induces an antagonistic effect that relieves a cMET
and STAT3-mediated compensatory feedback that might explain the failure of AKT
inhibitors in the clinic so far.

Research into therapies against specific targets or
signaling pathways is one of the pillars of current cancer
research, although most tumors are still treated with
conventional cytotoxic therapies. Drug resistance remains
the main obstacle to the success of cytotoxic therapies
[3]. As with many aspects of the tumorigenic process,
most research on drug resistance has focused on the
acquired resistance of malignant cells, which is basically
limited to the reduction of an initial tumor burden, and

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most
prevalent cancer and the leading cause of cancer mortality
worldwide [1], but its early diagnosis makes the disease
one of the most curable cancers [2], at least in developed
countries. Nevertheless, one of the main obstacles that
patients have to deal with over the course of the disease is
resistance to treatments.

so fails to eradicate a sufficient number of cancer cells
to prevent clinical recurrence. Despite the extensive use
of chemotherapy, the specific mechanisms causing tumor
regression or recurrence after treatment are poorly known.
Environment-mediated drug resistance is a form of
de novo resistance in which tumor cells are transiently
protected from drugs [4]. The elevated serum levels of
several cytokines secreted mainly by CAFs, such as IL-8,
IL-1β, VEGF, TNFα, IL-17 and IL-6, have a prognostic
value and are also implicated in tumor aggressiveness and
poor response to therapy [5]. Signaling events triggered
by such stromal cytokines and growth factors may be
involved in de novo resistance, contributing to the failure
to eliminate minimal residual disease, resulting, after
strong selective pressure of therapy, in the recruitment
of cancerous cells with acquired-resistance phenotypes
[6, 7]. This protective effect is not universal across tumor
types and drugs [8]. The effect of the microenvironment
on resistance to targeted therapies is easier to understand
conceptually, since different soluble factors might
activate signaling events converging in the same pathway
downstream of the targeted molecule/receptor. However,
the mechanisms of microenvironment-mediated drug
resistance for nonspecific and pleiotropic conventional
chemotherapeutic agents, such as platinum compounds
and antimetabolites, are still unclear.
Here we explore how CAF-soluble factors contribute
to CRC chemoresistance in the presence of antimetabolites
and DNA-damaging agents, like 5-fluorouracil (5FU),
oxaliplatin (L-OHP). To this end, we decided to investigate
multiple signaling pathways that may be involved in
mediating resistance and that might offer a useful approach
to identifying and describing some cellular and molecular
alterations in the CRC chemoresistance process. We also
examined how colorectal cancer cells may be sensitized to
chemotherapy, in order to overcome the chemoresistance
induced by CAFs.

In addition, as shown in Figure 1c (top panel), the
degree of protection conferred by CAF-soluble factors
is variable, and it will probably depend on the capacity
of each CAF to secrete protective factors, suggesting a
certain degree of CAF heterogeneity that we [9] and others
[10] have previously reported.
We suspected that such a protective effect might
be a consequence of a slower proliferative capacity of
cell lines in the presence of CAF-CM, as depicted in
Figure 1c (lower panel; wst-1 assay), an observation
already reported by us [11] and corroborated in Figure 1d
(microphotography and hemocytometer counts).
Regarding the colony-forming assay, such
differential proliferative rates were also observed (bigger
colonies in DMEMF12) when cells were cultured in the
absence of drugs (Figure 1e, left plates), while the number
of colonies (>50 cells) was similar for both conditions
(DMEMF12 and CM). Conversely, CAF-CM clearly
stimulated the formation of colonies in the presence
of 5FU and, to a lesser extent, for oxaliplatin or the
combination (FUOX).
Additionally, CAFs were capable of inducing
chemoresistance even when they were also exposed to
chemotherapy in a 24-well Transwell coculture system, as
depicted in Figure 1f: the more fibroblasts that interact in
the coculture, the more protection was observed for tumor
cells, suggesting that higher concentrations of soluble
factors can induce more protection.

Cell death assessment and cell cycle phase
distribution of CRC cells cultured with CAF-CM
or DMEMF12 in the presence of oxaliplatin or
5FU
We first assessed the capacity of CAF-soluble
factors to diminish the apoptotic rates of colorectal cancer
cells lines. Surprisingly, all the cell lines tested displayed
a very low percentage of cells in apoptosis when exposed
to 5FU or oxaliplatin at corresponding IC50 doses
(Supplementary Figure S1), as reported by other authors
[12, 13]. Remarkably, the apoptotic rate was slightly
lower even than under basal conditions, suggesting that,
although CAF-soluble factors reduce apoptosis in tumor
cells, the mechanism of cell death is something other than
apoptosis. Another factor that attracted our attention was
the presence of swollen cells, particularly in the presence
of 5FU, that despite also being reduced with respect to the
entire population occur in a lower percentage in CAF-CM
than in DMEMF12 for both treatments (Supplementary
Figure S1). This is probably due to some cells dying by
the process of oncosis, which is characterized by nuclear
and cytoplasmic swelling. Nevertheless, the total number
of oncotic or apoptotic cells was low when exposed to
IC50 values of both drugs, suggesting a different type of
cell death or a delayed or asynchronous process. Thus, we
evaluated the total population of dead cells (PI staining)

RESULTS
Altered chemosensitivity of colorectal cancer
cells after continuous exposure to chemotherapy
in the presence of conditioned media from CAFs
We checked whether CAF-soluble factors influenced
the chemosensitivity of different colorectal cancer
cell lines with different genetic backgrounds to the
conventional anticancer drugs oxaliplatin and 5FU. We
obtained the IC50 after 96 hours of continuous exposure
to drugs in the presence of standard culture medium
(DMEMF12) or conditioned medium (CM) from normal
colonic fibroblasts (NCFs) or paired CAFs. As illustrated
in Figure 1a, for all cell lines tested, CM from CAFs
(CAF-CM) conferred a survival advantage on the two
anticancer agents separately in relation to DMEMF12, and
in combination (FUOX; Figure 1b).

CAFs is variable, probably depending on the ability to secrete particular cytokines/soluble factors that induce chemoprotection. This
effect might be associated with the proliferative rate of cells in the different CMs, as depicted in the histograms in the absence of drugs
(lower panel). d. This fact was confirmed by means ofa hemocytometer count (lower panel) after 4 days in culture, as depicted in the
microphotograph. e. A similar diminished proliferative rate was also observed by means of a colony formation assay in the absence of
drugs. However, the protective effect of CAF CM on HT29 cells was apparent after the addition of oxaliplatin and 5FU, separately or
in combination. f. The protective effect might be involved in the concentration of the soluble factors responsible for such effect, since
increasing quantities of fibroblasts increased the viability of tumor cells in a Transwell coculture proliferation assay. In addition, CAFs can
induce such an effect in the presence of chemotherapy.

statistic).
for a longer exposure to 2× or 4× IC50 values for 5FU and
L-OHP. As illustrated in Table 1, after 48 hours continuous
exposure to 5FU or oxaliplatin, both cell types (HT29 and
DLD-1) exhibited relatively low levels of PI-positive
cells to a similar extent for CAF-CM and DMEMF12,
even with a 4× IC50 drug concentration. However, the
protective effect of CAF-CM was observed after extending
the assay time until 120 hours of continuous exposure to
drugs (HT29 cells) or even longer periods (168 hours for
DLD-1 cells).
Given the long time required for effective cell death
observed in previous experiments we aimed to evaluate
the proportion of cells in each cell cycle phase to assess
the effect of CAF-CM on the cell cycle perturbation
induced by L-OHP or 5FU. Results are illustrated in
Supplementary Table S1, confirming a less number of cells
accumulated in S-phase and G2/M for 5FU and L-OHP
respectively for HT29 cells and fewer cells in aneuploidy
for DLD-1 cells, interline variation already reported for
antimitotic drugs [14]. Interestingly, CAF-CM induced
an accumulation of cells in G0G1, suggesting a prolonged
G1 transit, in concordance with the lower proliferative
capacity observed.

that leads to disruption of RAD51-BRCA2 complex and
then DSB repair. CHK2 has also been involved in base
excision repair. In addition, CHK2 is an essential protein
for maintaining genome integrity and is involved in the
control of mitosis progression and repression of cell
death during mitosis. Thus, we hypothesize that during
mitosis CAF-soluble factors might mitigate the mitotic
catastrophe induced by the drugs activating CHK2 for the
proper control of the G2/M checkpoint. We observed a
higher level of Thr68 phosphorylation of CHK2 in DLD1 cells cultured in CAF-CM compared with standard
DMEMF12 after long-term exposure (24 hours and
48 hours) to 5FU and oxaliplatin, as depicted in Figure
2a. We corroborated the results using a P53 wt cell line
(HCT116; Figure 2b). Thus, soluble factors secreted by
CAFs might induce CHK2-mediated cell cycle arrest
before entering mitosis in order to ensure DNA repair,
thereby preparing cells for correct cell division. Higher
levels of Aurora B in CAF CM also points to a correct
mitosis in such conditions, particularly for 5FU treatment,
where there was a statistically significant increase of
AURKB positive cells (P<0.0001) and overexpression for
L-OHP (Supplementary figure S2).
The mechanisms by which cells are able to restart
the cell cycle and enter mitosis after the activation of
the G2/M checkpoint seem to be regulated by CDC25
phosphatases, in particular CDC25B. The latter is an
essential protein that enables a cell to resume the cell cycle
after DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest [19]. When
we examined the expression of CDC25B we observed
overexpression of the phosphatase in cells cultured in
standard culture medium compared with CAF-CM in
the presence of both oxaliplatin and 5FU. This suggests
a premature G2/M transition to overcome a deficient
checkpoint control (Figure 2c).

CHK2 is overstimulated in colorectal cancer cell
lines cultured with CAF-conditioned media
The absence of apoptosis and the prolonged time
needed to observe moderate levels of necrosis suggested
that cells could be arrested at the point of entering mitosis
with or without repairing the DNA damage induced by
oxaliplatin and 5FU. CHK2 provides a survival signal
for tumor cells when exposed to DNA damaging agents
[15], especially for those inducing DSB, like doxorubicin,
cisplatin [16], oxaliplatin and 5FU [17, 18] and is a key
protein for DNA repair mediating BRCA2 phosphorilation

CAF-conditioned media stimulate AKT, Survivin
and P38 nuclear translocation

cells. Additionally, ligands present in CAF-CM were
particularly efficient in activating JAK/STAT and AKT
pathways, as shown in Supplementary Figure S5 and S6.
Thus we decided first to check whether STAT3 inhibition
could bypass the effect triggered by soluble factors
released by CAFs. Stable silencing of the transcription
factor by means of shRNA revealed that cells were more
sensitive to oxaliplatin even in the presence of CAF’s CM,
where different JAK/STAT activators are present (Figure
5a). Interestingly, levels of Survivin were also decreased
in STAT3 deficient cells (Figure 5b). In addition, the
STAT3 silencing was also efficient sensitizing oxaliplatinresistant cells (HTOXAR3), to both oxaliplatin and 5FU in
different experimental conditions with JAK/STAT ligands
(Figure 5c and 5d).

It is well known that AKT is crucial to overcoming
the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint after DNA damage. In
addition, the PI3KCA/AKT/mTOR/Survivin pathway
has been associated with 5FU, cisplatin and resistance to
other DNA-damaging agents in many types of cancer. In
evaluating the phosphorylation of AKT, we observed an
increase in cells cultured with CAF-CM compared with
DMEMF12 for DLD-1 (Figure 2d) and HCT116 (Figure
2e) exposed to 5FU or L-OHP. This result might be
predictable, since the large quantity of ligands secreted by
CAFs that activated the PI3KCA/AKT pathway as well
as JAK/STAT, a cytokine-addicted pathway. Additionally,
phosphorylation of Ser2448 mTOR, P38 activation and
overexpression of Survivin were also evidenced in cells
cultured with CAF CM (Figure 2f).
We also explored the AKT and Survivin subcellular
localization. We observed sustained AKT phosphorylation
in the nucleolus of cells cultured in CAF-CM (Figure
2g). This is accompanied by the nuclear translocation
of Survivin and P38 (Figure 2h), which occurs more
efficiently in cells under the influence of CAF-soluble
factors. AKT, Survivin and P38 nuclear translocation
were corroborated in different cell lines and treatments
by immunofluorescence (Figures 3, 4 and Supplementary
Figures S3 and S4a). Subconfluent continuous cell cultures
also showed an increase in P38 downstream kinase
MAPKAP2 when cells were exposed to CAF-conditioned
media (Figure 2i). Additionally, the administration of a
P38 inhibitor (VX-702) sensitizes colorectal cancer cells
to oxaliplatin and 5FU (Supplementary Figure S4b).
We also checked the expression of Cyclin D1, as a
common downstream effector of JAK/STAT and PI3KCA/
AKT pathways, inducer of chemoresistance in many
tumor types and essential for cell cycle progression. As
illustrated in Figure 2j, cyclin D1 was overexpressed in
cells cultured in CM. Additionally, there was an inverse
correlation with the levels of cyclin D3 also reported by
Zhang P et al [20] in relation to cisplatin sensitivity.
All the events described so far seem to involve
some factors secreted by CAFs in mediating de novo
chemoresistance to L-OHP and 5FU. All the studied
pathways are also overstimulated in cells with acquired
resistance, as depicted in Figure 2k, suggesting that there
is a degree of convergence between stroma-mediated and
genetically acquired resistance.

Pharmacological inhibition of AKT antagonizes
with chemotherapy
Furthermore, we also examined whether the
pharmacological inhibition of AKT with MK2206, a
highly selective allosteric AKT inhibitor, could also
overcome the effect induced by CAF-CM.
Astonishingly, MK2206 seems to have an
antagonistic effect with L-OHP and 5FU even at different
doses tested (IC5 and IC50) for the two conditions
tested (Figure 6a and 6b). The combination index values
(>1) confirmed the antagonistic effect of MK2206 with
oxaliplatin (Figure 6c) and for 5FU (Figure 6f). In addition
there is a high correlation between the dose of MK2206
and the increase of the IC50 values for chemotherapeutic
agents (Figure 6e).
We suspected that these observations could be due
to compensatory mechanisms that are the consequence
of inhibiting a crucial oncogenic pathway like PI3K/
AKT. The expression of MYC and RTK (particularly
IGF1R, EGFR and ERBB3) is involved in compensatory
mechanisms after PI3K/AKT inhibition [21–24]. After 24
hours of treatment we observed potent AKT inhibition
even at very low doses (100 nM; Figure 6g), confirming
the efficacy of the inhibitor. Interestingly, although we
did not observe overexpression of previously reported
RTK or MYC, a compensatory feedback loop seems
to me mediated by JAK/STAT pathway, regarding the
overexpression of JAK1 and hyperactivation of STAT3
according to the dose increase of AKT inhibition (Figure
6g).

DISCUSSION

STAT3 silencing sensitizes cells to oxaliplatin
and 5FU. Pharmacological inhibition of AKT
antagonizes with chemotherapy

While many research publications have described
cell-autonomous processes playing decisive roles in
mediating acquired resistance to chemotherapy, little is
known about the influence of the tumor microenvironment
on responses to chemotherapy.

We have previously shown that CAF-CM can
shift the IC50 curves for 5FU and oxaliplatin even in
genetically determined oxaliplatin-resistant HTOXAR3

The present study showed how soluble factors
secreted by CAFs trigger a cell signaling cascade
that protects cells from the action of conventional
chemotherapy used in colorectal cancer treatment, a
process involving the nuclear translocation of AKT and
P38 and the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway.
It is intuitive that cytokines, chemokines and growth
factors secreted in large quantities by CAFs will activate

signaling cascades mainly through the PI3KCA/AKT
and JAK/STAT pathways, and that such signaling is a
requisite and a key event for cell proliferation, migration
and invasion [25, 26]. However, these pathways are also
relevant for cell cycle regulation, survival and DNA repair
[27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32].
Our results confirmed that the PI3K-AKT and JAKSTAT pathways were overexpressed in the presence of

Figure 3: Localization of pAKT assessed by immunofluorescence. HT29, DLD-1 and HCT116 cell lines were treated with 5FU

in the presence of DMEMF12 or CM-CAFs. The nuclear translocation of pAKT occurs in the treatments where soluble factors from CAFs
were present, while, in DMEMF12 treatments, pAKT was mainly founded predominantly in cytosolic areas.

conditioned media from CAFs, even in the presence of
5FU or oxaliplatin administration. However, the location of
activated AKT is crucially important for such a protective
effect conferred by CAF-soluble factors. Once activated,
different AKT isoforms translocate to diverse subcellular
compartments to exert specific functions depending on the
location [27]. Nuclear translocation of AKT during G1 in
particular has been associated with cell cycle progression

[33], Cyclin D1 expression [34] and DNA repair after
double-strand breaks (DSBs) [35]. Additionally, different
growth factors and soluble molecules have been reported
to induce nuclear translocation of AKT (e.g., IGF1,
insulin and NGF) [36, 37, 38]. In the context of our
results, soluble factors secreted by CAFs induce nuclear
AKT translocation that might provide protection from
cell death, ensuring correct DNA repair and triggering

cell cycle arrest to strictly control the G2/M transition
caused by the increased levels of CHK2 phosphorylation
in CAF-CM-cultured colorectal cancer cells. Conversely,
cells grown without the contribution of cytokines and
growth factors provided by the fibroblasts, in the presence
of DNA-damaging agents, cannot efficiently repair the
damaged DNA since the checkpoint control does not work
properly. The elevated levels of CDC25B boost entry into
mitosis without ensuring genome integrity. Our cell cycle
analyses corroborate this. Therefore, the decision of cells
to remain in the G2/M phase or to go through defective
mitosis is favored by microenvironmental factors,
enhancing both the nuclear translocation of AKT and the
phosphorylation of CHK2. Furthermore, DNA damageinduced activation of CHK2 results in Survivin trafficking
from the mitochondria to the cytosol, inducing the
inhibition of apoptosis and promoting tumor cell survival
[15]. In our experiments there was no suggestion that cells
were dying by apoptosis. In fact, we clearly observed that
cells developed a necrotic pattern after long-term exposure
to both oxaliplatin and 5FU. This finding, in combination
with the cytometric cell cycle analysis, led us to conclude
that the higher levels of Survivin detected in whole-cell
extracts of cells cultured with CAF CM might control
processes other than apoptosis.
It has already been reported that Survivin can
be located in different subcellular pools inside the cell,
cytosol, mitochondria and nucleus [39]. These subcellular
pools, as AKT, are believed to be strongly tied to its
varying cellular functions. Studies have demonstrated
that the nuclear pool mediates Survivin function in
mitosis, while the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions
are responsible for its antiapoptotic function [40].
When we assessed the levels of Survivin in nuclear and
cytoplasmic extracts we observed that almost all Survivin
was translocated to the nuclei in cells cultured with CAFCM. In addition, Survivin associates with microtubules to
contribute to the correct assembly of chromosomes during
the spindle formation [41]. Survivin can also repress cell
death in mitotic cells, preventing mitotic catastrophe [42].
Our results suggest that nuclear AKT and STAT3 might
regulate Survivin, as reported in platinated agents like
cisplatin [43] and for 5-fluorouracil [44]. In fact, different
cytokines and growth factors like IL6, IGF1 and CCL2
are known inducers of Survivin overexpression in a PI3kinase/AKT or JAK/STAT dependent process [44–46].
The consequence is that many cells die during mitosis
or divide inaccurately, dying in the next division or
generating instability, as found in colorectal cancer cells
exposed to anti-mitotic drugs [14].
Another event that is closely related to the
mechanism detailed above is the translocation of P38
MAPK to the nucleus in cells cultured in CAF-CM, which
occurs more efficiently than in standard culture medium.
In response to DSBs induced by DNA-damaging agents,

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

P38 is activated to control the G2/M checkpoint [47]
and is translocated to the nucleus. Therefore, cytokines/
chemokines or other soluble factors secreted by CAFs
may enhance the nuclear translocation of P38 MAPK in
tumor cells to facilitate the phosphorylation of P38 nuclear
targets necessary for the induction of the appropriate
G2/M cell cycle checkpoint and correct DNA repair in
those cells carrying DSBs.
From the point of view of the functional assays,
as a consequence of the signaling described, CRC
cells cultured in CAF-CM seem to be less sensitive
to chemotherapy, shifting IC50 curves to a greater
extent than NCF-CM compared with standard culture
medium, making it a cause of chemoresistance. All these
mechanisms give rise to a slower proliferative rate, even
in the absence of DNA-damaging agents, as determined
by MTT assays, hemocytometer counting and prolonged
G1 phase in a flow cytometric cell cycle assessment. This
is in line with the fact that the subtype of colorectal cancer
tumors that is most enriched in stromal components, and
fibroblasts in particular, are less proliferative, overexpress
Survivin, displayed fewer genetic alterations [48–50],
qualities involved in chemoresistance. These are features
that we observed culturing CRC cells in CAF-CM.
In addition we can not ascribe the observations and
mechanisms described here to a single factor secreted
by CAFs. These cells synthesize a large amount of
different redundant cytokines and growth factors, most of
them activating ligands of JAK/STAT or PI3KCA/AKT
pathways.
Different strategies, like STAT3 silencing or AKT
and P38 inhibition have been employed to diminish
microenvironment-mediated drug resistance. These
pathways are also involved and constitutively activated
in acquired-resistance processes, suggesting convergence
of stroma-induced and genetically determined resistance.
The inhibition of STAT3 and P38 sensitizes cells to
chemotherapy, while the inhibition of AKT elicits a
compensatory feedback mechanism that appears to be
mediated by the overexpression of Met and activation of
STAT3 that may explain the failure of AKT inhibitors.
In conclusion, we report here that cytokines,
chemokines and other soluble factors secreted by CAFs
induce nuclear translocation of selected effectors that
in turn slow the progress of the cell cycle, thereby
affecting proliferation. In the presence of conventional
chemotherapy, such effectors permit the stabilization and
activation of selected downstream proteins that ensure
correct DNA repair and correct mitosis entrance and
exit, avoiding the damage induced by such agents. From
a clinical perspective, our study provides information of
use in assessing the preclinical value of STAT3 and P38
inhibition in chemotherapy-sensitizing strategies designed
to overcome microenvironment-mediated resistance.
Identifying the soluble factors that mediate such

59776

events might yield valuable information to circumvent
microenvironmentally-mediated drug resistance, although
the compensatory loops and redundancy of many such
cytokines for the same signaling pathways might give
rise to new resistant phenotypes. Hampering key common
proteins responsible for the synthesis of such cytokines/
growth factors in CAFs might be an interesting approach
to avoid the protective effect exerted by such molecules
and to render tumor cells sensitive to chemotherapy.

The samples analyses were performed in a Gallios
Flow Cytometer and the generated data analyzed using
FCS Express Analysis Software (de Novo software).

Colony formation assay
1×103 CRC cells were plated in 60-mm culture
dishes (or 2×102 in 6-well plates) and incubated at 37°C.
After overnight incubation, treatments were added
and incubated for 2 weeks. The clones were fixed with
methanol for 2 minutes, stained with 0.5% crystal violet
and incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes. The
cells were washed to remove staining exceeded. Colonies
were defined from counts of at least 50 cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
All the experiments were performed under the
approval of the IDIBELL’s Ethics Committee. Samples for
fibroblast isolation were obtained under patient’s informed
consent.

Immunofluorescence staining
The cells were seeded in coverslip slides on 6-well
plates, fixed with paraformaldehyde (PFA) 4% for 20
minutes and washed 3 times with PBS 1×, permeabilized
with PBS 1× 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for
5 minutes and blocked with BSA 2% for 45 minutes–2
hours. Cells were incubated with primary antibody in
BSA 2% in a dilution 1:50 overnight and then incubated
with 1:200 fluorescence secondary antibody in BSA 2%
for 1 hour at room temperature. Coverslip slides were
mounted in VectaShield with DAPI (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, USA).

Fibroblast culture and conditioned media
acquisition
The fibroblasts were isolated and the conditioned
media (CM) were obtained as described previously [11].

Colorectal cancer cell lines
DLD1 (MSI positive, chromosomal instability
pathway negative, Kras mutated, PI3KCA mutated, TP53
mutated), HCT116 (MSI positive, chromosomal instability
pathway negative, Kras mutated, PI3KCA mutated, TP53
wild type), HT29 (MSS, chromosomal instability pathway
positive, Braf mutated, PI3KCA mutated, TP53 mutated),
HTOXAR3 (HT29 oxaliplatin-resistant derivative;
transcriptionaly characterized in GSE10405).

Western blot analysis
Protein concentration was determined by the BCA
Protein Assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). 30 μg of the
protein extract was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and
transferred to PVDF membranes. After blocking for 1
hour with 5% dried non-fat milk in TBS 1× - Tween 0.1%,
the membranes were incubated with primary antibody
diluted 1:1000 in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in
TBS 1× - Tween 0.1%. Antibody binding was detected
using a secondary antibody diluted 1:2000 in TBS 1×
- Tween 0.1% and an enhanced chemiluminescence
(ECL) detection kit (Amersham, Buckinghamshire,
UK). α-tubulin expression was used as an endogenous
control. A general protocol for nuclear and cytosolic
fractions separation was used. Briefly, cells were washed
twice in PBS and scrapped in 300 μl of cytoplasmic lysis
buffer containing 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 10 nM KCl,
0.01 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol,
5 mM Na2VO4, 20 mM sodium beta-glycerophosphate,
0.1% Nonidet P-40, and a cocktail of protease inhibitors
(Roche). Nuclei were sedimented by centrifugation and the
supernatant containing the cytoplasmic fraction removed.
The nuclei were then washed in 1 ml of cytoplasmic
lysis buffer to remove any contaminating cytoplasm
and resedimented. The nuclei were then lysed in 100l of
denaturing lysis buffer.

Cell proliferation
WST-1 proliferation assay was performed following
manufacturer instructions. Previously, 2000 cells/well
(HT29, HTOXAR3, DLD-1, HCT116; all cell lines were
obtained from our own cryobank except the oxaliplatinresistant derivative HTOXAR3, kindly provided by Dr.
E.M.Balibrea) were plated in six replicative wells in 96well plates and allowed to attach, then grown in DMEM
F12 at 37°C overnight. Next day, drugs were added in
standard media or fibroblast CM. The cells were incubated
for 5 days. The effect of the drug on each cell line in the
presence or absence of CM was calculated by normalizing
the number of cells after 5 days of continuous treatment to
the maximum number of cells in each treatment (standard
DMEMF12 medium, normal colonic fibroblast-CM [NCFCM] or CAF-CM).

Cell cycle analysis
The cell cycle was assessed by conventional PI
staining.

Cell death assessment

Statistical analysis

In order to assess necrosis or apoptosis by flow
cytometry and immunofluorescence, cells were stained
with the Promokine apoptotic/necrotic/healthy cell
detection kit (cat #PK-CA707-30018, PromoCell,
Heidelberg, Germany). First, the cells were detached
from the cell culture plate using StemPro Accutase
Cell Dissociation Reagent (cat #A1110501, Thermo
Scientific), washed twice with 1X binding buffer and
then incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature with
staining solution (5 μL of FITC-Annexin V, 5 μL of
Ethidium Homodimer III and 5 μL of Hoechst 33342
to 100 μL of 1× binding buffer). Cells were washed 1-2
times and mounted on a slide for microscope viewing,
or resuspended in 400 μL in 1× binding buffer and
then sent for flow cytometry analysis within 1 hour of
staining in a Gallios Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter,
Krefeld, Germany).
The Ac-DEVD-AMC Caspase-3 fluorogenic assay
(BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Agustin de Guadalix,
Madrid, Spain) was performed to assess caspasedependent apoptosis. Whole cellular extract (adherent
cells and floating cells) was recovered with lysis buffer
and, subsequently, 20 μM of Ac-DEVD-AMC and the
cell lysate were replaced by 1 mL of protease assay
buffer (described in the manufacturer’s instructions). The
reaction mixtures were incubated for 2 hours at 37°C in
the dark and then measured at wavelengths of 380 nm
excitation and 430-460 nm emission.
Immunofluorescence of cleaved caspase 3 was also
carried out.

Data from independent experiments were
statistically analyzed using the nonparametric MannWhitney U test to compare group differences between
experimental and control samples at a level of significance
of P<0.05. Extra sum-of-squares F test was carried out
in GraphPad PRISM 6 (GraphPad Software, San Diego,
California, USA) to identify statistically significant
differences (P<0.05) between IC50 curves.

in HTOXAR3 colorectal cell lines. Glycerol-stored
plasmid was previously replicated, isolated, transfected
in HEK293T cells and finally transduced in target cells.
Cells were selected, according to kill curve values, with
puromycin (2 μg/ml). A non-silencing GIPZ lentiviral
shRNA containing a random vector was used as a control
in both cell lines in subsequent experiments. Western blot
was performed to confirm STAT3 silencing efficiency in
colorectal cell lines.
