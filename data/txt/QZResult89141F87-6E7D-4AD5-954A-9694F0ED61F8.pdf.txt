Abstract
NAD(P)H oxidase is a major endogenous source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS may not only be
involved in carcinogenesis but also in efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents like doxorubicin. By a comprehensive genotyping approach covering 48 genetic polymorphisms (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) in five subunits of phagocytic NAD(P)H oxidase, we asked whether they affect gene expression, enzymatic activity, and
outcome of CHO(E)P chemotherapy. A highly consistent effect was observed for the CYBA 640A>G variant.
In peripheral blood granulocytes of 125 healthy volunteers, the G allele of 640A>G was associated with lower
NAD(P)H oxidase activity (P = 0.006). Moreover, the G allele was associated with lower mRNA and protein
expression (both P = 0.02). Of clinical importance, the outcome of patients suffering from non-Hodgkin lymphoma and treated with CHO(E)P regimen was dependent on the CYBA 640A>G polymorphism. In an exploratory study (n = 401), carriers of 640GG had an event-free survival (EFS) risk ratio of 1.95 [95% confidence
interval (95% CI), 1.31–2.90; P = 0.001] compared with 640AA. In a confirmatory set (n = 477), the risk ratios
were 1.53 (1.04–2.25, P = 0.03). The complete set of 878 patients showed a relative risk of 1.72 (1.30–2.26) and
1.59 (1.14–2.21) for EFS and overall survival, respectively. Further molecular-biological experiments showed
lower expression and reduced stability of transcripts with the G allele in lymphoblastoid cell lines. Transfection of allele-specific plasmids into HEK293 cells elicited lower activity for the G allele in a luciferase reporter
gene construct. Thus, CYBA 640A>G was shown to be a functional polymorphism with possible consequences
for patients receiving CHO(E)P chemotherapy and might have further implications for other ROS-mediated
modalities. Cancer Res; 70(6); 2328–38. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in cellular
functions like tissue growth, cell differentiation and proliferation, apoptosis, and regulation of blood vessel tone (1, 2).
Therefore, ROS have been associated with the pathogenesis
of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders as well as
cancer (3–6). Oxidative DNA damage plays a well-established
role in carcinogenesis of various tumors (7), for instance,
chronic systemic inflammation with increased production

of ROS seems to be a risk for non–Hodgkin lymphoma
(8–11). Beyond their role in carcinogenesis, ROS mediate
the therapeutic effects of anticancer drugs like bleomycine
or the anthracyclines (12–16). In addition, induction of
mitogen-activated protein kinases most likely mediated by
ROS was found upon exposure to doxorubicin (17). Furthermore, NAD(P)H oxidase interferes with gene expression of
metalloproteinases upon doxorubicin treatment (18).
NAD(P)H oxidase is a particularly important source for the
production of superoxide, which is a major precursor of

CYBA 640A>G: Function and Effect on Chemotherapy

other ROS. It was first detected in phagocytes, where it is
highly expressed. This enzyme is a multimeric protein
complex, and for some components also isoforms in different
cell types have been discovered (19–21). It is now believed
that NAD(P)H oxidases play important roles in almost all
cells beyond phagocytes. Its expression in B lymphocytes
has also been shown (22).
The phagocytic isoform is an inducible NAD(P)H oxidase
consisting of two membrane-anchored and four cytosolic
proteins that get assembled upon stimulation. The membrane-bound components represent a big catalytic (gene
name CYBB, traditional protein name gp91phox) and a smaller
adjacent subunit (CYBA, p22phox). Whereas for CYBB at least
seven different isoforms in other cells have been discovered,
CYBA is identical in all NAD(P)H oxidase types. In neutrophilic granulocytes the cytosolic components are NCF2
(p67phox), NCF1 (p47phox), NCF4 (p40phox), and the small
GTP-binding protein RAC2 (rac2).
Phagocytic NAD(P)H oxidase can be activated by various
stimuli, for instance, by bacterial and fungal antigens. The
phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) is a strong stimulant
leading to phosphorylation of the NAD(P)H oxidase subunit
p47phox via protein kinase C resulting in subunit assembly
(23, 24).
The amount of superoxide production by NAD(P)H oxidase and the medical consequences of this variable superoxide production may depend on genetic polymorphisms (25).
An increased lymphoma risk was attributed to the frequent
genetic polymorphism 242C>T in the CYBA subunit of NAD(P)H
oxidase in one study (26), but not in another (27). Moreover,
242C>T in CYBA and another genetic polymorphism in NCF4
were associated with chronic doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy (28). A comprehensive analysis of the multiple polymorphisms in the NAD(P)H oxidase genes in relation to
enzyme activity is still lacking. We have shown earlier that a
frequent variant in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of CYBA
(termed 640A>G) was associated with lower activity of phagocytic NAD(P)H oxidase (29). However, the mechanism how
this variant might affect the enzyme activity was not resolved.
Thus, the aim of this study was to identify (a) by a comprehensive genotyping approach which polymorphisms in five of
the six subunits of phagocytic NAD(P)H oxidase associate
with enzyme activity and subunit expression, (b) by which
mechanisms they act, and (c) whether there is medical relevance for the outcome of patients with non–Hodgkin lymphomas. Because of extensive sequence homology, the sixth
subunit (NCF1) could not unequivocally be genotyped.

Materials and Methods
Study subjects. In granulocytes of healthy volunteers (n =
125), NAD(P)H oxidase activity was measured. In a subset of
these granulocytes (n = 31), CYBA protein expression was assessed. Because granulocytes contain only rare amounts of
mRNA, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from
an independent healthy volunteer group (n = 103) were taken
for these analyses.

The clinical cohort consisted of 1,399 patients having participated in the German non–Hodgkin's lymphoma study
(NHLB) comprised by NHL-B1 for patients ≤60 y with normal
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and NHL-B2 for elderly patients as formerly described (30, 31). These patients were
treated with CHO(E)P (either CHOP or CHOEP) chemotherapy. From a subset of patients (n = 878), DNA was available
for pharmacogenetic testing, and thus associations between
genotypes and the clinical outcomes [event-free survival
(EFS) and overall survival (OS)] could be assessed. The
healthy volunteer and the clinical study including the pharmacogenetic testing were approved by the ethics committee
of the Georg-August-University of Göttingen. More details
about the study courses are found in Supplementary Data.
Selection criteria for genes and genetic polymorphisms.
We intended to get a comprehensive representation of genetic variability of all the six subunits pertinent to phagocytic
NAD(P)H oxidase. Whereof one subunit NCF1 (alias NCF1A)
could not be analyzed due to two pseudogenes (NCF1B,
NCF1C) making unequivocal genotyping not feasible both
by the HapMap project group and by our genotyping procedures. For the five remaining genes, i.e., CYBA, CYBB, NCF2,
NCF4, and RAC2 (inclusive ±5 kb upstream and downstream),
the genetic polymorphisms selected for our analysis correspond to three criteria: (a) literature reports on investigated

Molecular-biological methods. Protein expression of
CYBA was quantified by Western blotting. Relative mRNA
transcript numbers of CYBA, CYBB, NCF2, NCF4, and RAC2
were quantified by real-time PCR. In the genomic region of
these five genes, single-nucleotide polymorphisms at 48 loci
were determined. In 32 lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) from
the Coriell Institute,9 which are heterozygous at 640A>G allelic expression imbalance was assayed (32). In 7 and 10 LCLs
with 640AA and 640GG genotype, respectively, transcript stability of CYBA mRNA was assessed upon treatment with actinomycin D (33, 34). To delineate a functionality for CYBA
640A>G plasmids with either allele were constructed and
subjected to luciferase reporter gene assays. Details of these
techniques and the identifiers of the LCLs are described in
Supplementary Data.
DNA sequence motif search for microRNAs, transcription factors, and splice sites. MicroRNA (miRNA) binding

potentially at the CYBA 640 site were scanned with TargetScan10
(35). Transcription factor binding motifs in the region of
CYBA 640A>G were searched using TRANSFAC Professional
2008.4.11 Herein, for tissue-specific profiles, “vertebrate nonredundant profiles” were selected and the algorithm was
set to minimize false positive results. Potential splice sites
altered by CYBA 640A>G were checked using NetGene2
server12 (36).
Statistical analysis. Impact of genotypes on enzyme activity, mRNA and protein expression in leukocytes of healthy
volunteers was analyzed by Jonckheere-Terpstra trend test
considering allele-dosage effects. To minimize false-positive
associations, also in these functional assays, the concept of
an initial explorative and a validation data set was followed.
For additional molecular-biological assays performed for
CYBA 640A>G, the level of significance was set to P < 0.05.
Of the NHL-B1/B2 trial patients, 878 DNA samples were
available for analysis. This set was split in an exploratory
and validation study comprising 401 and 477 samples, respectively. Event-free survival (EFS) was defined as the time from
the beginning of therapy to either disease progression, initiation of salvage therapy, or additional (off-protocol) treatment,
relapse, or death from any cause. OS was defined as the time
from first day of treatment to death from any cause. EFS and
OS were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The effect of
genetic variants on EFS and OS was tested by the log-rank
trend test and further analyzed in a multivariate Cox regression analysis, adjusting for known adverse risk factors defined
by the International Prognostic Index (IPI; age >60 y, lactate

Results
The effect of genetic polymorphisms in NAD(P)H oxidase
was assessed functionally in healthy volunteers by measuring
enzyme activity. The clinical relevance of these SNPs was
evaluated in terms of CHO(E)P chemotherapy outcome of
patients suffering from non–Hodgkin lymphoma. Both approaches were conducted in an exploratory and a confirmatory fashion (for subject characteristics, see Table 1).

NAD(P)H oxidase polymorphisms: association with enzyme activity and clinical outcome. In DNA samples from
healthy volunteers and NHLB patients together (both of Caucasian origin), 47 of 48 SNPs analyzed were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) with each P > 0.01 (for 46 SNPs P >
0.2, for NCF2 rs789180 P = 0.03 according to χ2 test). The
remaining SNP (CYBB rs4422908) was in HWE in the study
with healthy volunteers (P = 0.6) but failed in the clinical set
(P = 0.002). HWE for the four X-chromosomal CYBB SNPs
was only tested for women.
The criteria for selection of the 48 SNPs, the observed minor allele frequencies, and the associations with enzyme activity and EFS are summarized in Table 2.

Bonferroni correction of the raw P values given in Table 2, only
these two SNPs, i.e., CYBA rs3180279 and CYBA 640A>G,
remained statistically significant in the clinical study part
(threshold set at 0.05/48 markers, 0.001). Regarding the enzyme
activity measurements, CYBA 640A>G exhibited the strongest
signal, although slightly failing the very conservative P value
of 0.001. However, the association of enzyme activity and CYBA
640A>G, which was initially analyzed separately in two independent cohorts (29), was well reproducible at P = 0.05.
CYBA 640A>G: association with enzyme activity, protein,
and mRNA expression. The strong associations (Table 2) for
CYBA 640A>G and CYBA rs3180279 are no independent findings due to the high degree of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in
this 3′ region of CYBA (r2 = 0.79 between these two SNPs in
HapMap, Fig. 1A; r2 = 0.91 in our samples). The effect of
CYBA 640A>G on enzyme activity (same data as in Table 2)
is graphically illustrated in Fig. 1B. We then evaluated the
effects of the 640A>G polymorphism on protein and mRNA
expression of CYBA in leukocytes of healthy volunteers. West-

ern blot analysis revealed an association of the low-activity
640G variant with lower amounts of CYBA protein in granulocytes (Fig. 1C). In addition, the low-activity 640G variant
was associated with significantly lower CYBA mRNA transcripts in freshly isolated peripheral blood cells of healthy volunteers (Fig. 1D).
CYBA 640A>G: impact on the outcome of CHO(E)P chemotherapy. Figure 2 illustrates the effect of CYBA 640A>G on
the CHO(E)P chemotherapy outcome. It affected both EFS
(Ptrend = 0.0009 according to log-rank trend test; Fig. 2A)
and OS (Ptrend = 0.015; Fig. 2B).
Next, we tested in a Cox proportional hazard model the
effect of CYBA 640A>G when adjusted for the five IPI factors
(Table 3A). Regarding EFS, this analysis revealed a relative
risk of 1.95 (95% CI, 1.31–2.90) for the GG versus AA genotype
and 1.34 (0.94–1.92) for the AG versus AA genotype. For OS, a
relative risk of 1.73 (1.09–2.74) for GG versus AA genotype and
1.36 (0.90–2.05) for AG versus AA was observed. Additional adjustment for the application schedule of the chemotherapy,

CYBA 640A>G: Function and Effect on Chemotherapy

Figure 3. Molecular-biological experiments for
elucidation of the CYBA 640A>G mechanisms.
A, allelic expression imbalance in 32 LCLs
heterozygous at CYBA 640A>G. For each LCL,
the A-to-G electropherogram signal intensity
relation in cDNA is divided by that of genomic
DNA and the LCLs are sorted by increasing
of this ratio. Statistical significance for an
expression imbalance was assessed with
Wilcoxon's signed-rank test eliciting
P = 0.000001 in favor of the A allele. B and C,
effect of CYBA 640G>A polymorphism on
mRNA stability. The decrease in CYBA
mRNA after treatment with actinomycin D
was measured in 17 LCLs harboring either
640AA (n = 7) or 640GG (n = 10). B, differences
in the background CYBA expression (before
the addition of actinomycin D) between
the AA and the GG carriers. C, the
genotype-dependent differences in the
degradation rates of CYBA mRNA 12 and
24 h upon actinomycin D addition. These
data are normalized to expression levels
measured between 0 and 6 h, where no net
decrease was observed. Columns, median
values; bars, SEM. Significance was tested
by one-sided Student's t test. D, gene
expression is dependent on CYBA 640A>G
but not on miR-663. Expression of the chimeric
luciferase reporter gene carrying CYBA 3′UTR
with 640A or G alleles was analyzed in the
presence and absence of miRNA. Samples
with no miRNA (none), unspecific miRNAs
(scrambled), and increasing concentrations
of human miR-663 were analyzed. Columns,
average of the luciferase activity of three
independent experiments; bars, SEM.
Luciferase activity of plasmids containing either
640A or 640G are referred to the construct
without CYBA 3′ UTR (control). Univariate
analyses over all five settings revealed a
significantly lower activity for the G than for the
A allele (P = 0.03), but no effect of miR-663.

the addition of etoposide, or the application of radiation therapy revealed similar relative risks for CYBA 640A>G for both
OS and EFS (data not shown).
The effect of the SNP CYBA 640A>G was further validated
in a nonoverlapping group of 477 NHLB study patients.
Thereby, CYBA 640GG compared with 640AA elicited similar
effects as in the exploratory group. The relative IPI factoradjusted risk for carriers of 640GG compared with 640AA
was 1.53 (95% CI, 1.04–2.25; P = 0.032) for EFS and 1.38
(P = 0.018) for OS in this confirmatory cohort. This resulted
in 1.72 times poorer EFS (95% CI, 1.30–2.26; P = 0.0001) and
1.59 times (1.14–2.21; P = 0.007) worse OS in the entire study
group for 640GG in relation to 640AA. No difference was
observed between 640AG and 640AA in the second cohort.
Hence, a recessive effect of the 640G allele was assumed,

and the respective data are summarized in Table 3B for
the exploratory, the confirmatory, and the entire cohort.
In summary, the CYBA 640GG status was reproducibly associated with a poorer outcome upon CHO(E)P therapy.
Molecular mechanism underlying the effects of CYBA
640A>G. The different expression in dependence on CYBA
640A>G (Fig. 1C and D) could be due to allelic expression
imbalance between 640A and 640G. To further prove that,
RNA and genomic DNA from LCLs heterozygous for the
CYBA 640A>G genotype were harvested simultaneously. Normalized to genomic DNA, preferred mRNA expression of
transcripts with the A compared with the G allele was observed in 31 of 32 LCLs (Fig. 3A).
This lower concentration of the G allele-carrying transcripts might be due to differences in gene transcription or

mRNA degradation. To differentiate between both mechanisms, we next tested for mRNA stability using blockade of
transcription with actinomycin D. To do this, we analyzed
the kinetics of mRNA degradation using LCLs of 17 unrelated
HapMap-CEU participants, which were homozygous for the
640A>G polymorphism (7 AA and 10 GG genotypes). Consistent with the allelic expression imbalance data, the CYBA expression was 51% lower in cells with 640GG compared with
640AA already before addition of actinomycin D (Fig. 3B). Importantly, upon actinomycin D treatment faster mRNA degradation was noticed for 640GG (Fig. 3C). Calculation of
median CYBA transcript half-lives revealed 6.9 and 14 hours
for GG and AA transcripts, respectively.
To show that CYBA 640A>G is really causative, plasmids
only differing at this position were assessed in a luciferase
reporter gene construct in HEK293 cells. Following the observation of impaired transcript stability in presence of 640G,
one hypothesis was altered binding of miRNAs. Hence, we
scanned TargetScan database for potential miRNAs binding
at this region, in particular, with allele-specific properties.
The most promising candidate of this search was miR-663.
Perfect matching with miR-663 is only accomplished for
640G, but not for 640A. However, when synthetic miR-663
was transfected to cells with allele-specific constructs, no effect on luciferase activity was noticed. Surprisingly, an increased luciferase reporter activity was observed for the
640A allele independent of miR-663 (Fig. 3D). In a univariate
analysis over all five conditions (no miRNA added, with
scrambled, or with three different concentrations of
miRNA-663), the difference between 640A and 640G was statistically significant (P = 0.03).
In summary, in addition to the associations with EFS, enzyme activity, protein, and mRNA expression of CYBA, further
findings supported a functional role of CYBA 640A>G, namely
(a) allelic expression imbalance, (b) altered transcript stability, and (c) allele-specific effects on luciferase reporter gene
activity. The latter one, in particular, corroborates CYBA
640G to be a hypofunctional allele compared with 640A, as
these findings were drawn from allele-specific constructs excluding functional effects of any other polymorphism due to
genetic linkage or allele-specific methylation disparities.

Discussion
This study provided seven independent lines of evidence
for functionality and possible medical relevance of the
640A>G polymorphism in the 3′ UTR of CYBA, the small
membrane-bound subunit of NAD(P)H oxidase. Compared
with the A allele, the G variant reproducibly was associated
with lower enzymatic activity (Fig. 1B) and was related to
smaller amounts of p22 phox protein (Fig. 1C) and CYBA
mRNA (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, allelic expression imbalance
was observed disfavoring the G allele (Fig. 3A), and the respective mRNA was faster degraded (Fig. 3C). Most importantly in terms of clinical relevance, prognosis of a CHO(E)P
chemotherapy was less favorable in non–Hodgkin lymphoma
patients who carried the 640G allele (Fig. 2; Table 3). Most convincing in terms of molecular biology, allele-specific effects

2336

Cancer Res; 70(6) March 15, 2010

for CYBA 640A>G could be shown allowing to classify this
polymorphism as being functional.
The CYBA 640A>G polymorphism was initially described
by de Boer and colleagues (37), but up to date, its functional
and clinical relevance is still under debate (38, 39, 40).
Starting from a comprehensive analysis between NAD(P)H
oxidase activity and genotypes, covering tagging SNPs in five
of the six subunits consistently revealed a significant effect of
640A>G in CYBA. In line with a diminished enzyme function,
presence of this polymorphism was accompanied by reduced
expression of CYBA mRNA and protein.
Intriguingly, the same polymorphism of the 48 SNP panel
was also related to a worse outcome of patients having
received a CHO(E)P chemotherapy for non–Hodgkin lymphoma. These patients were unrelated to the subjects in
whom the functional analyses have been performed. The mechanisms underlying this effect of the CYBA 640A>G
polymorphism in non–Hodgkin lymphoma are not yet
understood. Two population-based case-control studies did
indicate that SNPs in the oxidative stress pathway could
modulate susceptibility to non–Hodgkin lymphoma, but an
effect of CYBA 640A>G was denied (26, 27). Thus, the possibility that CYBA 640A>G affects the initiation of lymphoma
is less likely. After disease onset, it could modulate the natural course and/or be related to chemotherapy regimen. Inhibited oxidative burst and less NAD(P)H oxidase activity
was detected in granulocytes of cancer patients (41), however, without having addressed any effect of genetic polymorphisms.
The effect of CYBA 640A>G remained significant upon adjustment for the well-established prognostic IPI parameters.
However, based on the study design we cannot differentiate
which specific chemotherapeutic drug interacted with the
CYBA 640A>G genotype or whether the effect on prognosis
was even independent from the drug therapy. Whereas a significant contribution of etoposide or radiation therapy could
be ruled out, cyclophosphamide and, in particular, doxorubicin could be the major candidates. Superoxide production of
NAD(P)H oxidase was reported to be enhanced in presence
of doxorubicin (42). Genetic polymorphisms in the NAD(P)H
oxidase have been proposed as predictive markers for the
cardiotoxic potential of this drug (28).
Concerning the medical relevance of our data for therapy response in non–Hodgkin lymphoma, the absence of rituximab in the studied clinical sample is a limitation
concerning direct clinical use of the CYBA 640A>G variant
as future predictive marker in non–Hodgkin lymphoma.
However, our data may be relevant for many chemotherapeutic regimens in which doxorubicin and/or cyclophosphamide is contained in or where ROS are expected to
mediate effects or side effects (which could be the case
for virtually all classic cytostatics).
To date, there are only very few reports having addressed
the medical relevance of polymorphisms in ROS-related
genes for cancer therapy outcome. One intriguing finding
was that of Fagerholm and colleagues (43) showing a deficient allele in the ROS-detoxifying NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) conferring both enhanced breast cancer

risk and reduced sensitivity toward anthracycline-containing
chemotherapy. These authors postulated that higher ROS
amounts due to less NQO1 activity also act detrimental, e.g.,
by increasing genetic instability. In contrast, our results suggest that reduced ROS production could mediate poor clinical
outcome of an anthracycline-containing regimen. The question whether ROS should be increased or decreased during
cancer therapy is a matter of a still unresolved discussion
(44). To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first pointing out a genetic polymorphism in a ROS-related enzyme complex potentially implicated in cancer chemotherapy response.
The clinical association of the 640G allele found in our
study may also shed a new light on earlier observations of
a reduced susceptibility toward clozapine-induced agranulocytosis in carriers of the 640G allele (45). Together with our
findings of a poorer outcome of patients with non–Hodgkin
lymphoma, CYBA 640G could be related to reduced leukocyte
apoptosis triggered by ROS. However, no effect of CYBA
640A>G on the hematologic side effects of the CHO(E)P regimen could be verified in our clinical study group.
What might be the biological basis behind our observed
genotype-phenotype correlations? Given its location in the
3′ UTR, it could modulate binding of transcription factors,
transcript stability, splicing, or translation efficiency. In view
of the fact that 640A>G modified both mRNA and protein expression, an effect on elongation efficiency during translation
at the 80S ribosomal complex is less likely.
Performing an internet tool–based search of donor and acceptor splice sites separately for 640A and 640G did not yield
different results. Therefore, there is currently no evidence
that this polymorphism might alter splicing.
Transcript stability can be modulated by different factors,
e.g., mRNA conformation or binding of miRNA often enhancing RNA degradation. Indeed, evaluation of mRNA stability
suggested higher susceptibility to degradation for the G allele
compared with the A allele. This differential sensitivity dependent on the 640A>G genotype may both explain the ef-

fects on CYBA mRNA and protein expression in leukocytes
and the allelic expression imbalance. Database search for
miRNAs elicited miR-663 as the most promising candidate.
In proof-of-principle experiments, however, no effect of this
miR-663 could be detected. Conversely, the observed miRNAindependent effects of CYBA 640A>G could be related to transcription factors with allele-specific binding properties.
TRANSFAC database screen indicated one transcriptional repression factor, Kid3, binding in presence of 640A, but not
640G. Not much is known about this protein. It seems to regulate expression patterns during human development of
brain and kidney (46).
In summary, relevance of the CYBA 640G allele was shown
by extended clinical and thorough biochemical and molecular-biological data. In the clinical setting, carrying this variant implied a worse therapeutic outcome in patients treated
with CHO(E)P regimen for non–Hodgkin lymphoma. Biochemically, it was linked to a reduced NAD(P)H oxidase activity. On the molecular-biological level, there were four lines
of associations supporting the hypothesis that CYBA 640A>G
could be a functional variant. That could finally be proved
with allele-specific constructs indicating that there are less
transcripts for the 640G allele and/or they are less stable.
