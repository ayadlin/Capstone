ABSTRACT
The signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling
pathway plays critical roles in the pathogenesis and progression of various human
cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, we aimed to
evaluate the therapeutic potential of physalin A, a bioactive withanolide derived
from Physalis alkekengi var. francheti used in traditional Chinese medicine, was
evaluated in human NSCLC cells. Its and determined whether it effect oninhibited
both constitutive and induced STAT3 activity, through repressing the phosphorylation
levels of JAK2 and JAK3, resulting in anti-proliferation and pro-apoptotic effects on
NSCLC cells was also determined, and. theThe antitumor effects of physalin A were
also validated usingin an in vivo mouse xenograft models of NSCLC cells. Physalin
A had anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in NSCLC cells with constitutively
activated STAT3; it also suppressed both constitutive and induced STAT3 activity by
modulating the phosphorylation of JAK2 and JAK3. Furthermore, physalin A abrogated
the nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of STAT3, thereby decreasing
the expression levels of STAT3, its target genes, such as Bcl-2 and XIAP. Knockdown
of STAT3 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly enhanced the
pro-apoptotic effects of physalin A in NSCLC cells. Moreover, physalin A significantly
suppressed tumor xenograft growth. Thus, as an inhibitor of JAK2/3-STAT3 signaling,
physalin A, has potent anti-tumor activities, which may facilitate the development of
a therapeutic strategy for treating NSCLC.

INTRODUCTION

for a subset of patients with tyrosine kinase activating
mutations750) [2–5]. However, most NSCLC patients do
not benefit from the TKI treatment. Of those few who do,
many will eventually develop resistance, resulting from a
secondary EGFR mutation (e.g., T790M) or activation of
other signaling pathways [6–12]. Thus, there is an urgent
need for the development of novel, effective and safe
therapeutic agents for the treatment of NSCLC.

Lung cancer is the leading cancer killer worldwide
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for
80% of lung cancers [1]. Although recent progress has
been made with the development of epidermal growth
factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs),
such as gefitinib and erlotinib, they are only effective

Natural compounds derived from medicinal plants
have played an important role in combating cancer. For
example, Physalis alkekengi var. franchetii (Solanaceae)
has been widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for
the treatment of sore throat, cough, eczema, hepatitis,
urinary problems and tumors [13]. We have previously
demonstrated that physalin A, a major bioactive steroidal
component of P. alkekengi var. franchetii, possesses
anti-inflammatory activity by modifying IKKβ through
a Michael addition reaction [14]. In addition, physalin
A can activate mitochondrial apoptotic pathways
through p53-Noxa-mediated ROS generation in human
melanoma A375–S2 cells [15]. It also activates the death
receptor-associated extrinsic apoptotic pathways via
the upregulation of Fas expression [16]. However, the
molecular mechanism underlying its anti-tumor activities
has not been fully elucidated.
Constitutive activation of signal transducers and
activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) plays a critical role
in the tumorigenesis and progression of various human
malignances [17–20]. Notably, persistently activated
STAT3 was observed in approximately 50% of late-stage
NSCLC tumors analyzed [21]. STAT3 activation is highly
regulated by intracellular kinases, such as Janus kinases
(JAKs) and Src, which are hyperactivated in a wide range
of human cancers, including NSCLC [22–24]. Therefore,
inhibition of STAT3 signaling has been suggested to be
a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of this
malignancy.
In this study, we investigated the effect of physalin A
on the proliferation, apoptosis, and JAK/STAT3 signaling
pathway in NSCLC cell lines. In addition, the anti-tumor
activity of physalin A was tested in an in vivo xenograft
model. Our results indicate that physalin A is a promising
anti-cancer agent with potential clinical application in the
treatment of NSCLC.

H358 and H1975 cells at 5, 10, and 15 μM of physalin
A were significantly sensitive to the inhibitory effect
of physalin A (all p ≤ 0.002). Interestingly, physalin
A induced higher growth inhibition in TKI-resistant
H1975 cells than in H292 and H358 cells (10 and 15 μM,
p ≤ 0.005, Figure 1B).
The levels of phosphorylated STAT3 at Tyr705
(Tyr705-p-STAT3) and total protein were next examined
in all five NSCLC cell lines. p-STAT3 levels were high
in H292, H358 and H1975 cells (Figure 1C), which
were shown to be sensitive to physalin A (Figure 1B).
In contrast, H460 and A549 cells, which were relatively
resistant to physalin A, had almost undetectable levels of
p-STAT3 (Figure 1C). Therefore, we hypothesized that
the growth inhibitory effect of physalin A was mediated
through its repression on STAT3 activation.

Physalin A induces apoptosis of human NSCLC
cells
We next determined whether physalin A induced
apoptosis of H292, H358 and H1975 cells. By examining
Annexin V-FITC/PI flow cytometry, we found physalin
A significantly increased apoptosis in H292, H358, and
H1975 cells in a dose-dependent manner (at 15 µM
physalin A, apoptosis rate: 41.7%, 62.2%, 36.6% for
H292, H1975 and H358 cells, respectively, Figure 2A).
Accordingly, physalin A substantially increased the levels
of apoptotic markers, such as cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP), cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved
caspase-9, in H292, H358, and H1975 cells (Figure 2B).
However, total levels of caspase-3 and caspase-9 were
reduced by physalin A (Figure 2B). These data suggest
that physalin A induced apoptosis via repressing STAT3
activation, resulting in lowered NSCLC cell viability.

Physalin A inhibits constitutive and IL 6-induced
STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr705

RESULTS

Tyr705 and Ser727 are the critical phosphorylation
sites for the activity of STAT3. To investigate whether
physalin A suppressed STAT3 activity, H292 cells with
considerable basal levels of activated STAT3 were
treated with various concentrations of physalin A for 4
h. As shown in Figure 3A, physalin A inhibited Tyr705
phosphorylation of STAT3 in a concentration-dependent
manner, while the basal Ser727 phosphorylation levels of
STAT3 were not altered. Similarly, in H358 and H1975
cells, physalin A attenuated the levels of Tyr705-p-STAT3,
but not Ser727-p-STAT3 (Figure 3A).
STAT3 is phosphorylated at tyrosine 705 by
upstream kinases in response to cytokines and growth
factors, including interleukin 6 (IL-6), oncostatin M,
leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and epidermal growth

Physalin A inhibits cell viability in human
NSCLC cells with constitutively activated STAT3
To determine the anti-proliferative effects of
physalin A (structure shown in Figure 1A) in NSCLC
cells, five human cell lines (H292, H358, H1975, H460,
and A549 cells) were treated with various dosages of
physalin A for 24 h. In addition, adenovirus-12 SV40
hybrid virus transformed, non-tumorigenic human
bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells were also included
as normal control epithelial cells. As shown in Figure 1B,
physalin A at 15 μM slightly suppressed the viability of
BEAS-2B cells by approximate 10–15%. Similarly, H460
and A549 cells were relatively resistant to physalin A.

factor (EGF) [25]. Therefore, we next determined
whether physalin A could inhibit IL-6-induced STAT3
phosphorylation in IL-6 stimulated cells. As shown
in Figure 3B, IL-6-induced Tyr705-p-STAT3 was
substantially suppressed in NSCLC H292, H358 and
H1975 cells. Thus, physalin A inhibited constitutive and
IL-6-induced STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation in NSCLC
cells.

STAT3 protein levels by approximately 60%, accompanied
by an 18.5% increase of apoptosis. More interestingly,
the combination of physalin A treatment with siRNA
significantly enhanced cell apoptosis (61.6% vs. 30.9%
10 μM physalin A alone, p < 0.001, Figure 4A).
Analysis of total and phosphorylated STAT3 levels
revealed that whereas STAT3 siRNA or physalin A
alone induced a moderate reduction of p-STAT3 levels,
the combination of siRNA and physalin A completely
abrogated the Tyr705-p-STAT3 expression in H292 cells
(Figure 4B). Therefore, siRNA-mediated knockdown
of STAT3 expression significantly enhanced the proapoptotic effects of physalin A, supporting the critical
role of STAT3 inhibition in the induction of apoptosis by
physalin A.

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) knock-down of
STAT3 enhances physalin A-induced apoptosis
We next investigated whether the siRNA suppression
of STAT3 expression enhanced the pro-apoptotic effect
of physalin A. As shown in Figure 4B, siRNA reduced

Physalin A suppresses STAT3 nuclear
translocation and transcriptional activity

To further confirm the inhibitory effect of physalin
A on STAT3 transcriptional activity, we evaluated STAT3dependent transcriptional activation using dual-luciferase
reporter assays. As shown in Figure 5B, physalin A
significantly decreased STAT3-specific luciferase activity
in H292 cells.
Next, to confirm that physalin A suppressed STAT3mediated gene expression and elucidated the mechanism
underlying its pro-apoptotic effects, we analyzed the
expression levels of STAT3 downstream target genes, Bcl-2
and XIAP. As shown in Figure 6, the mRNA and protein
levels of Bcl-2 and XIAP were significantly decreased in
H292, H1975 and H358 cells by physalin A. Therefore,
physalin A suppressed STAT3 transcriptional activity,

STyr705-phosphorylated STAT3 translocates from
the cytosol to the nucleus as a homodimer and subsequently
activates the transcription of downstream target genes. Thus,
we next examined if physalin A could inhibit the nuclear
translocation of p-STAT3 using immunofluorescence
assay. After serum starvation for 12 h, H292 cells were
incubated with 15 µM physalin A for 6 h after which
immunofluorescence analysis was undertaken. As shown in
Figure 5A, Tyr705-p-STAT3 was predominantly localized
in the nucleus of control H292 cells. In contrast, the nuclear
level of p-STAT3 was dramatically decreased by physalin A.

and JAK3 in a dose-dependent manner, but did not affect
that of JAK1 and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). Similarly,
physalin A reduced the levels of phosphorylated JAK2
(P-JAK2) in both H1975 and H358 cells, whereas only
JAK3 phosphorylation (P-JAK3) was decreased in H1975
cells (Figure 7B).
We next examined the time course of physalin
A effects on tyrosine kinase activity in H292 cells.
Interestingly, the levels of p-JAK2 and p-JAK3 decreased
as early as 30 min and were almost completely abrogated
after 2 h of drug treatment, which coincided with a
decrease in Tyr705-p-STAT3. These results suggest that
physalin A-induced inhibition of p-STAT3 was mediated
by reduced JAK activity.

Physalin A inhibits phosphorylation of JAKs in
NSCLC cells
Tyrosine 705 phosphorylation of STAT3 can be
induced by tyrosine kinases of the Janus family (JAKs) and
Src kinases [22–24, 26]. To investigate whether physalin
A inhibited constitutive activation of various kinases in
NSCLC cells, we treated H292 cells with physalin A for
4 h and analyzed activation (phosphorylation) levels of
the relevant tyrosine kinases. As shown in Figure 7A,
physalin A inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2

(Ser727), p-STAT3, STAT3 and β-actin.

The tumor inhibitory effect of physalin A was similar
to cisplatin (Figure 8D). Analysis of the tumor samples
revealed that physalin A decreased Tyr705-p-STAT3
levels, and increased caspase-3 activation (Figure 8E).
Taken together, these results demonstrated that physalin
A had anti-tumor activity that is comparative with the
conventional chemotherapy agent, cisplatin, without the
side effect of weight loss.

The anti-tumor activity of physalin A in vivo

models. Compared with the control mouse group,
the mean tumor volume and tumor weight were

DISCUSSION

Physalin A does not alter expression levels of
protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), NF-κB
activity, or suppressors of cytokine signaling
(SOCS)

In this study, we demonstrated that physalin A had
potent anti-proliferative activity against NSCLC cells
with constitutively activated STAT3, but less effect on
the NSCLC cells with lower levels of activated STAT3,
or non-transformed human lung epithelial cells. We
next showed that physalin A inhibited JAK2/JAK3
activity, repressed the levels of activated STAT3, and
downregulated the expression of STAT3 target genes,
such as Bcl-2 and XIAP, resulting in increased apoptosis.
Lastly, we demonstrated that in xenograft NSCLC tumors,
physalin A inhibited STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation
and suppressed the in vivo tumor growth, to a degree
comparable to cisplatin but with less detrimental influence
to the body weight.
STAT3 activation requires phosphorylation of
Tyr705, resulting in trans-modulation of downstream
target genes that are involved in cell proliferation, survival,

Many natural product-derived small molecules
inhibit the phosphorylation of JAKs and STAT3 indirectly,
via increasing the expression of PTPs and SOCSs [27–30].
In contrast, physalin A had minimal effects on the
expression levels of PTPs, such as SHP-1, SHP-2 and
PTEN (Supplementary Figure 1A). In addition, physalin
A did not affect the protein levels of NF-κB and p-NF-κB
(Supplementary Figure 1A) and nuclear translocation
of p-NF-κB (Supplementary Figure 1B). Furthermore,
the expression level of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 was not
affected by the treatment of physalin A in H292 cells
(Supplementary Figure 1C). Therefore, the inhibition of
JAK-STAT3 signaling by physalin A might be specifically
JAK-dependent.

angiogenesis and metastasis [31–33]. In the present study,
physalin A specifically inhibited both constitutive and
IL6-induced Tyr705 phosphorylation of STAT3, with
minimal impact on Ser727 and the levels of total
STAT3 protein. Physalin A can also dampen the nuclear
translocation and transcriptional activity of STAT3,
resulting in reduced expression levels of the anti-apoptotic
target genes, Bcl-2 and XIAP [34], which may account for
the physalin A-induced apoptosis in H292, H1975 and
H358 cells. The degree of apoptosis induction by physalin
A is similar to that of other withanolides, withaferin A, in
uveal melanoma [35] and sativolide withanolides isolated
from Jaborosa reflexa Phil. and J. cabrerae Barboza [36].
These results are also consistent with the findings of Hsu
et al. [37], in which physalin B, a major constituent of the
medicinal herb, Physalis angulata L., induced apoptosis
in human melanoma A375 cells via increased expression
levels of NOXA, Bax and caspase-3. In addition, physalin
F, another P. angulata L. component, induced reactive
oxygen species (ROS)-mediated apoptosis of human
renal cancer A498 cells [38]. Furthermore, the current
study demonstrated that physalin A displayed minimal
cytotoxicity to non-transformed bronchial epithelial cells
(BEAS-2B), suggesting a level of anticancer specificity.
Intracellular and receptor kinases, JAKs, EGFR
and src, are hyper-activated in various cancers (including
NSCLC), contributing to the phosphorylation of STAT3
at Tyr705 [33, 39, 40]. Of the JAK family kinases, JAK1,
JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2 can all play a critical role in
the activation of STAT3 [41, 42]. Here, we showed that
physalin A inhibited the phosphorylation of JAK2 and
JAK3 in human NSCLC cells with minimal impact on that
of JAK1, TYK2 and Src, suggesting that the inhibition
of Tyr705-p-STAT3 was mediated by JAK2 and JAK3
inhibition. Our hypothesis is supported by two recent
studies that showed a regulatory role of JAK2 in STAT3
activation in NSCLC cells [43, 44]. In contrast, JAK1 has
been suggested to activate STAT3 activity in lung cancer
cell lines [45]. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms
by which JAK members activate STAT3 in lung cancer
remain to be investigated in vitro and in vivo.
SOCS 1 and SOCS 3 are negative regulators of
JAK/STAT3 [29, 46–49]. Specifically, SHP-1, SHP-2
and PTEN dephosphorylate protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs),
such as JAKs [50–52]. In addition, SOCS 1 and SOCS 3
inhibit JAK/STAT3 signaling through direct binding and
suppression of the gp130 receptor and their associated
JAKs [48, 49]. However, physalin A did not significantly
influence PTP expression, SOCS levels, or p-NF-κB levels
and translocation. These results are in contrast to that
reported by Wu et al. [38], in which physalin F suppressed
NF-κB activation in human renal A498 cells. This apparent
contradiction may be due to cell type-dependent differences.
Nonetheless, the inhibition of JAK-STAT3 signaling by
physalin A might be specifically JAK-dependent.
Although our data suggest that the anti-tumor effects
of physalin A are mediated by suppression of JAK/STAT3
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

signaling, it remains possible that additional mechanisms
exist to account for its anti-tumor cytotoxicity, especially
given the antioxidant activity reported for physalin D,
another component of P. alkekengi [53]. Thus, further
studies will evaluate the impact of physalin A on the
oxidative state of cancer cells. Furthermore, our current
study only focused on physalin A, but other active
component physalins of P. alkekengi L. 5–14 have also
been identified in P. alkekengi L. Therefore, it is possible
that another physalin or a combination of physalins could
exert more potent cytotoxicity against human NSCLC
cells, which needs to be further explored [54, 55].
In summary, physalin A, a natural JAK2/JAK3
inhibitor, induces apoptosis of human NSCLC cells
through inhibition of the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway.
These findings support the further development of
physalin A as a potential anticancer drug for treating
human NSCLC.

STAT3 activation, H292, H358 and H1975 cells were
serum-starved for 12 h, incubated with 15 µM physalin A
for 6 h then exposed to 25 ng/mL of IL-6 for 15 min in the
presence of physalin A.

40 µg of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and
transferred to a PVDF membrane. After being blocked
with 5% BSA for 1 h at room temperature, the membrane
was incubated with primary antibodies diluted at 1:1000
overnight at 4oC, washed three times with TBST and
incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h at room
temperature. After being washed three times with TBST,
the membranes were developed with New Clarity™
Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad), imaged and analyzed
with a ChemiDoc™ XRS system and Quantity One
software (Bio-Rad).

Proliferation assays

STAT3 luciferase reporter assay

In vitro cytotoxicity was determined using the Cell
Counting Kit-8 (CCK8; Sigma-Aldrich) assay, according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were seeded
overnight on a 96-well plate (0.6 × 105 cells per well) to
achieve 70% confluence. Different concentrations of
physalin A (0, 2.5 5, 10, and 15 µM) were added for 24 or
48 h after which 10 µL of CCK-8 solution was added to
each well of the plate. After 2 h, the absorbance at 450 nm
(OD450) was measured. In vitro cytotoxicity was assessed
as the percentage of growth inhibition, which is calculated as
100% - [(OD450 of drug-treated cells/OD450 of untreated
cells) × 100%].

Luciferase assays were used to confirm p-STAT3
transactivation in the H292 cells, which were seeded on a
24-well plate at a density 1 × 105 cells per well 24 h prior
to transfection. The STAT3-TA-luc vector (kindly provided
by HM Shen at the National University of Singapore) was
mixed with Renilla luciferase vector (Promega, Fitchburg,
WI, USA) at a 7:1 ratio. Lipofectamine 2000 (Life
Technologies) was used according to the manufacturer’s
protocol, and physalin A was added 24 h post-transfection
for an additional 8 h. Cells were harvested, and luciferase
activities were determined using the Dual-Luciferase
reporter assay (Promega).

Annexin V assay

Immunocytochemical analysis of p-STAT3
localization

For flow cytometry analysis of annexin V
externalization, cells were seeded overnight on a 12-well
plate (1 × 105 cells per well) to achieve 70% confluence.
Different concentrations of physalin A (0, 5, 10, and 15 µM)
were added for 24 h, and annexin V levels were determined
using an Annexin V-FITC/PI staining kit (BD Pharmingen,
San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Briefly, cells were trypsinized, washed twice with
PBS and resuspended with Annexin V-FITC/PI binding
buffer, and 1 × 105 cells in 100 µL were incubated with antiAnnexin V-FITC and PI for 15 min at room temperature.
After 400 µL of Annexin V-FITC/PI binding buffer was
added, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using
a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometry (BD Pharmingen) to
detect the fluorescence signal.

Immunofluorescence staining was used to confirm
the localization of p-STAT3 in the cells. H292 cells were
treated with 15 µM physalin A for 4 h, fixed in 4% cold
paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and permeabilized with
−20°C methanol for 10 min. After blocking with 5%
BSA-0.3% triton-X for 1 h, the cells were incubated with
anti-p-STAT3 antibodies diluted 1:100 overnight at 4°C
followed by incubation with anti-mouse Alexa Fluor R555
(1:100; Life Technologies) for 1 h at room temperature.
The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI.

RT-PCR analysis
H292 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate (3×105
cells per well) and cultured until they reached 70%
confluence after which 15 µM physalin A was added and
incubated for 4, 8 and 12 h. Total RNA was extracted with
TRIzol (Life Technologies), and 1 µg of RNA was reverse
transcribed using the iScript™ cDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad) with the primer sequences indicated in Table 1. All
primers were synthesized from Sangon Biotech (Shanghai,
China). PCR amplification conditions were as follows:
94°C for 2 min; 28 cycles of 94°C for 2 min, 55°C for
20 s, 72°C for 5 min; and 72°C for 5 min. All PCR products
were visualized using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and
the ChemiDoc™ XRS system (Bio-Rad) for image capture
and analysis.

Western blot analysis
The cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (Beyotime,
Shanghai, China) with a protease inhibitor cocktail
(cOmplete ULTRA Tablets, Mini, EDTA-free,
EASYpack, Roche, Basel, Switzerland), which contains
serine, cysteine, and aspartic protease inhibitors, and
the Phosphokinase Inhibitor Cocktail Set V (Merck
KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) containing the serine and
cysteine protease inhibitors, 4- benzenesulfonyl fluoride
hydrochloride, Aprotinin, E-64, and leupeptin hemisulfate.
Protein concentrations were measured using a standard
DC protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and

Xenograft mouse model

2.	

Xenograft tumors were established by subcutaneous
injection of 5 × 106 human H292 cells in 0.2 mL of PBS into
the right front leg of BALB /c mice (mean age of 6 weeks).
A total of 24 male BALB /c mice was used and divided into
four groups (6 mice per group). When the tumor reached
100–150 mm3, PBS (1% DMSO and 5% Tween80),
40 mg/kg physalin A, 80 mg/kg physalin A, or 5 mg/kg
cisplatin was injected intraperitoneally for 10 days. Tumor
volumes were measured at 2-day intervals for the tumor
growth curve. After 10 days, the mice were sacrificed,
and tumors were removed and weighed. Protein extracts
from the tumors were isolated to detect STAT3 and cleaved
caspase-3 protein expression by Western Blot analysis. This
study was carried out in accordance with local guidelines
for the care of laboratory animals of Animal Experimental
Center, Zhejiang Academy of Medical Sciences, and
was approved by the ethics committee for research on
laboratory animal use of the Zhejiang Chinese Medical
University. Anti-tumor rates were defined as follows: the
average tumor weight of the control group (g) - the average
tumor weight of physalin A group (g)/ the average tumor
weight of the control group (g) × 100%.
