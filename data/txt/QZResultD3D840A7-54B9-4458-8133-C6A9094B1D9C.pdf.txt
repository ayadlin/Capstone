ABSTRACT
Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 8 (ERK8), also known as mitogen-activated
protein kinase 15 (MAPK15), is the most recently identified protein kinase of the
ERK family members and yet the least has been studied so far. Here, we report that
ERK8 is highly expressed in several human lung cancer cell lines and is positively
correlated with their sensitivities to the anti-cancer drug arsenic trioxide (As2O3).
As2O3 at physiologically relevant concentrations (5–20 µM) potently stimulates
the phosphorylation of ERK8 at Thr175 and Tyr177 within the TEY motif in the kinase
domain, leading to its activation. Interestingly, activated ERK8 interacts and directly
phosphorylates IkappaBalpha (IκBα) at Ser32 and Ser36, resulting in IκBα degradation.
This in turn promotes nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) p65 nuclear translocation and
chromatin-binding, as well as the subsequent induction and activation of proteins
involved in apoptosis. We also show that stable short-hairpin RNA-specific knockdown
of endogenous ERK8 or inhibition of NF-κB activity by NF-κB inhibitor in high ERK8
expressing lung cancer H1299 cells blunted the As2O3-induced NF-κB activation and
cytotoxicity towards these cells, indicating the critical role of ERK8 and NF-κB in
mediating the As2O3 effects. Taken together, our findings suggest for the first time
a regulatory paradigm of NF-κB activation by ERK8 upon As2O3 treatment in human
lung cancer cells; and implicate a potential therapeutic advantage of As2O3 that might
gain more selective killing of cancer cells with high ERK8 expression.

INTRODUCTION

and function [1–3]. Furthermore, ERK8 is regulated by
auto-phosphorylation and no specific upstream activating
kinase has been identified so far [1, 4, 5]. Earlier studies
from several research groups have shown that ERK8
activity can be stimulated by serum, DNA damage, and
human oncogenes such as RET/PTC3 (an active form of
the RET proto-oncogene) [1, 6, 7]. Moreover, ERK8 has
recently been shown to increase tumorigenesis in human
colon cancer cells by activating c-jun and in gastric cancer
cells by stabilizing c-Jun [8, 9]. Besides, ERK8 is involved
in maintaining genome stability as well as autophagy
[10, 11]. Yet, it is still unclear whether ERK8 acts as a
proto-oncogene or tumor suppressor. However, it should

Human ERK8 (alias MAPK15), located at 8q24.3,
is the most recently identified member of the ERK family
[1]. Over the past decades, despite the fact that in-depth
investigations have been done on typical ERKs (ERK1 and
2), the functions of ERK8 remain relatively understudied,
in which there are still a lot of unanswered questions for
its cellular function. ERK8 resembles ERK1, ERK2, and
ERK5 that possesses a Thr-Glu-Tyr motif in the activation
loop [1]. ERK8 has been considered as an atypical MAPK
partly because it contains the long carboxyl-terminal
domain that regulating its activity, cellular localization

be noted that protein expressed in one cell type might
actually function differently in another, leading to diverse
phenotypes. Therefore, no unified functions of ERK8 can
be drawn conclusively at present.
Arsenic trioxide (As2O3), a traditional Chinese
medicine, inhibits growth and promotes apoptosis in many
different cancer cell types. It has been proven especially
to be highly effective against hematologic malignancies,
such as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) [12, 13].
Moreover, promising preclinical activity of As2O3 against
malignancies other than APL was noted, such as myeloid
leukemia, lymphoma, lymphocytic leukemia, and solid
tumor cell lines of prostate, cervix, bladder, ovary, colon,
stomach, and esophagus [12]. Lung cancers are malignant
tumors with high incidences in China and worldwide
[14] and characterized with high mortality because of the
development of acquired resistance to chemotherapy [15].
Although recent studies have shed light on the potential of
As2O3 against human lung cancers [16–21], however, there
are still missing links to be explored.
In this study, we provide evidence to show that
ERK8 is highly expressed in several human lung cancer
cell lines. Remarkably, we report for the first time that
As2O3 at physiologically relevant concentrations (effective
in as low as ~5 µM) induces the phosphorylation of
ERK8 and activated ERK8 subsequently promotes the
phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, which leads to
the activation of NF-kB and lung cancer cell apoptosis.
The pro-apoptotic role of ERK8 and NF-kB played in
As2O3 cytotoxicity has been supported by the fact that
short-hairpin RNA-specific knockdown of ERK8 or
inhibition of NF-kB activity by NF-kB inhibitor in high
ERK8-expressing human lung cancer H1299 cells blunted
the As2O3-induced NF-kB activation and cytotoxicity
towards these cells, indicating that both ERK8 and NF-kB
are critical players in mediating the effects of As2O3. Taken
together, our findings establish a novel regulatory circuit
of NF-kB activation by ERK8 upon As2O3 treatment, and
implicate the potential of As2O3 in targeting lung cancers
with high ERK8 expression.

inducing drugs, we are particularly keen on As2O3 as it is a
well-known anti-cancer therapeutic agent with promising
efficacy on hematologic malignancies such as APL. To
determine whether ERK8 can be activated by As2O3, we
transfect Xpress-ERK8 in HEK293T cells and they were
subsequently exposed to As2O3. As the phosphorylation of
ERK8 at Thr175 and Tyr177 signifies its kinase activation
status and therefore we detected the levels of p-ERK8 at
Thr175 and Tyr177 upon As2O3 treatment in these cells by
western blot analyses. Surprisingly, from the results, it can
be seen that the phosphorylation of ERK8 is increased by
As2O3 treatment in a dose- and time-dependent manner,
suggesting that ERK8 can be activated by As2O3 and
that ERK8 may mediate the cellular effects of As2O3
(Figure  1A–1C). This prompts us further to delineate
the possible relationship of As2O3 and ERK8 and the
downstream targets.

IκBα as a novel substrate of ERK8
To date, knowledge about the cellular physiological
protein substrate(s) of ERK8 is limited. Previous studies
have shown that c-Jun is an ERK8 substrate and related
to colon and gastric cancer development [8, 9]. For this
reason, we sought to discover novel ERK8 substrates and
we are particular keen on redox signaling pathways since
we found that ERK8 can be activated by the oxidant As2O3.
To identify novel substrates of ERK8, we first expressed
and purified active His-tagged ERK8 and perform in vitro
kinase assay using a list of potential substrates available
in our laboratory. Remarkably, among these substrates, we
found that IκBα can be robustly phosphorylated by ERK8
at Ser32 and Ser36 as determined by western blot analyses
(Figure 2A and 2B), but not the ERK8 K42R kinase-dead
mutant (Figure 2C).
To determine whether ERK8 and IκBα interact each
other, plasmids encoding HA-IκBα and Xpress-ERK8
were cotransfected into HEK293T cells. IκBα proteins
were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA agarose beads
and subjected to western blot analyses using anti-Xpress
antibody. ERK8 was confirmed to interact with IκBα ex
vivo (Figure 2D). From the results, we reported for the
first time that IκBα is a novel substrate of ERK8 and the
likelihood of ERK8 in regulating NF-κB pathway.

RESULTS
As2O3 induces the phosphorylation of ERK8

ERK8 promotes the phosphorylation and
degradation of IκBα

Our group has been investigating novel functions of
oncokinases and their downstream substrates as potential
signaling axis/molecular targets for cancer intervention.
Here, we focused on novel functions and signaling
cascade mediated by ERK8. Previously, ERK8 has been
shown to be phosphorylated and activated by serum and
growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF)
and increased tumorigenesis of human colon cancer [8].
However, other stimuli that would lead to its activation
is unclear and the involvement of ERK8 in ROS stress/
redox signaling is largely unexplored. Among the ROSwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Among the redox sensitive transcription factors,
NF-kB is regulated by its inhibitor IκBα which sequesters
NF-kB from entering the nucleus. Upon stimulus,
phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser32 and Ser36 would lead to
the dissociation of IκBα from NF-kB and its subsequent
ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation; as a result, NF-kB is
translocated from the cytosol into nucleus and activates
NF-kB-dependent gene expression [22]. To investigate

the cellular physiological role of ERK8 in modulation
of NF-kB pathway, first, we transfected Xpress-ERK8
into HEK293T cells and they were subsequently
treated with 5 µM As2O3 for 4 h. From the western blot
results, we observed that ectopically-expressed ERK8
can be activated by As2O3 treatment and the p-ERK8
levels positively correlate to the amount of the ERK8
plasmid transfected (Figure 3A). Moreover, if IκBα is
a physiological substrate of ERK8 and ERK8 would
catalyze the phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser32/Ser36 in
cells, then ERK8 should also presumably promote the
degradation of IκBα. As expected, when we transfect an
increasing amount (1 to 6 µg) of Xpress-ERK8 expression
plasmid into cells and subsequently dosed them with 5 µM

As2O3, the expression level of endogenous IκBα declined
accordingly (Figure 3A). To correlate if the decline of
IκBα level is due to phosphorylation, we perform similar
experiments and also monitor the level of p-IκBα at
Ser32/Ser36. From the results, it can be seen that there is
an obvious enhancement of phosphorylation of IκBα at
Ser32/Ser36 in ERK8 transfected cells with As2O3 treatment
(Figure 3B, lane 4). Although there is also elevation
of the p-IκBα level in As2O3-treated cells (Figure 3B,
lane 3), however, the protein level of IκBα declined more
dramatically in Xpress-ERK8 transfected cells with As2O3
treatment (Figure 3B, lane 4). The ratio of p-IκBα/IκBα
has the highest value in Xpress-ERK8 transfected cells
with As2O3 treatment, reflecting that endogenous IκBα

protein level is rapidly declined. To further substantiate
the notion that the decline of IκBα protein level is due
to its proteasomal degradation, we pretreated these cells
with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 before exposure
to As2O3. From the results, treatment of MG132 prior
to As2O3 treatment prevented the decline of IκBα upon
As2O3 treatment (compare lane 2 to lane 3 in Figure 3C).
To determine whether IκBα degradation would lead to
enhanced NF-kB activity, we performed NF-kB luciferase
assay by cotransfecting the 5× kB firefly luciferase reporter
with Xpress-ERK8 expression plasmid in NIH/3T3 cells
and then challenged the cells with 5 µM As2O3 for 4 h.
Our results indicate that As2O3 can synergize ERK8 in
promotion of NF-kB activity (Figure 3D).

The results thus far suggested a potential paradigm
of NF-kB activation by ERK8. However, whether similar
phenomenon occurs in other cells would need to be
verified. As our team has been focusing on lung-related
disease, especially lung cancers; for this reason, we
screened the basal levels of ERK8 in several human lung
cancer cell lines available in our laboratory, including
Calu-3, H1299, H358, and H460, by quantitative realtime RT-PCR and western blot analyses. From the

results, it can be seen that ERK8 is expressed at low
level in Calu-3 cells; however, among the lung cancer
cells, ERK8 has a relatively high expression in H1299,
H358, and H460 cells (Supplementary Figure 1A and
1B). To determine whether there is NF-kB activation in
high ERK8 expressing cells, we checked on H1299 cells
since the subcellular fractionation quality turns out to
be the best among these cell lines. So, after we treated
H1299 cells with 5 µM As2O3, we fractionated individual
subcellular components and it was found that the levels
of nuclear NF-kB in nuclear-soluble and chromatinbound fractions increased as compared with untreated
control (Figure  4A). Similar results were observed in
H358 cells (data not shown). This indicates that there
is an enhanced NF-kB chromatin-binding in As2O3treated cells, and suggests that NF-kB might likely be
involved in modulating the subsequent gene expressions.
To further strengthen the relationship of As2O3-ERK8IκBα-NF-kB cascade, we generate H1299 stable ERK8

knockdown cells and examine the levels of p-IκBα and
IκBα upon As2O3 treatment. From our results, knocking
down ERK8 in H1299 cells blunted the phosphorylation
and degradation of IκBα (compare lane 3 to lane 4 in
Figure 4B), and as a result sustained the ratio of p-IκBα/
IκBα close to untreated controls. Furthermore, we also
performed NF-kB luciferase assay by transfecting the
5× kB firefly luciferase reporter in these shMock and
shERK8 cells and then challenged the cells with 5 µM
As2O3. Our results indicate that the NF-kB luciferase
activity is significantly suppressed in ERK8 knockdown
cells as compared to shMock control (Figure 4C). In
addition, the mRNA level of NF-kB downstream genes
Fas [23, 24] was detected to further confirm the activation
of NF-kB. Interestingly, the expression of Fas increased
in shMock but not in stable shERK8 H1299 cells upon
exposure to As2O3 (Figure 4D). These results suggest that
ERK8 is critical in mediating the effect of As2O3 and the
subsequent NF-kB activation in these cells.

As2O3 promotes cell death in high ERK8expressing lung cancers

unclear. For this reason, we sought to study the phenotype
of cells mediated by this regulatory circuit. As mentioned
earlier, since there is a relatively high ERK8 expression
in H1299 cells, we would therefore want to know the
outcome of As2O3 treatment to this high ERK8-expressing

treated with As2O3 (5 to 20 µM) and monitored, it can be
seen that massive cytotoxicity occurred in a dose- and
time-dependent manner in this cell line (Figure 5A). To
check whether the observed cytotoxicity is due to the
execution of apoptosis, we checked the expression levels
of several important apoptosis mediators by western blot
analysis. The induction/cleavage of BAX/CASP9/CASP3
can well be observed (Figure 5B), suggesting that As2O3
treatment indeed leads to apoptotic cell death. As a proof
of concept, we perform similar experiments on shMock
and shERK8 H1299 cells. This time, the cell viabilities
were monitored by MTS assay post 48 h of As2O3
treatment. Notably, knocking down ERK8 in H1299 cells
sustained the cell viability of shERK8 cells upon As2O3
treatment, but not in shMock cells (Figure 5C). Similar
results were observed in H460 cells (data not shown). In
addition, knocking down ERK8 in H1299 cells blunted
the induction/cleavage of marker proteins involved in
apoptosis (Figure 5D).

study, we focused on novel substrates of ERK8. Previously,
it has been reported that ERK8 is overexpressed in
human colon cancers [8], suggesting that ERK8 might
be a promising chemotherapeutic target. Here, we first
wonder whether ERK8 may be overexpressed as well in
lung cancers. For this reason, we screened the levels of
ERK8 in several human lung cancer cell lines available
in our lab, including Calu-3, H1299, H358, and H460, by
quantitative real-time RT-PCR and western blot analyses.
From the results, it can be seen that ERK8 is expressed at
low level in Calu-3 cells. However, among the lung cancer
cells, ERK8 has a relatively high expression in H1299,
H358, and H460 cells (Supplementary Figure 1A and 1B).
The traditional Chinese medicine As2O3 is a wellknown anti-cancer therapeutic agent with promising
efficacy on hematologic malignancies such as APL.
Interestingly, we found that As2O3 induced preferential
cytotoxicity in several high ERK8-expressing lung cancer
cells (H1299, H358, and H460) (Figure 5; Supplementary
Figure 1C). Indeed, the pivotal role of ERK8 that it plays in
mediating the effect of As2O3 has been demonstrated in our
study, in which shRNA knockdown of ERK8 or inhibition
of NF-kB activity by JSH-23 treatment blunted the As2O3induced NF-kB activation and cell death in H1299 cells.
Although the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK
also increased slightly by As2O3 treatment (Figure 1A and
1B; Supplementary Figure 2), however, the magnitude of
ERK8 phosphorylation is significantly higher as compared
to those of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in all the respective
time points and As2O3 dose examined, suggesting that
ERK8 is dominantly activated by As2O3 in high ERK8
expressing cells (Figure 1A-1C; Supplementary Figure 2).
Altogether, these data confirm that the interplay of ERK8IκBα-NF-kB is critical for mediating the apoptotic signal
exerted by As2O3 (Figure 7).
To date, besides IkappaB kinases and ribosomal
S6 kinase 2 [25, 26], other potential kinases on the
phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser32 and Ser36 is unknown/
understudied. Moreover, knowledge about cellular
physiological protein substrate(s) of ERK8 is limited.
Previous studies have shown that c-Jun is an ERK8
substrate and related to colon and gastric cancer
development [8, 9]. In here, we show that As2O3 can
specifically promote the activation of ERK8 and the
subsequent phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα,
leading to NF-kB activation and inducing cell death in
high ERK8 expressing human lung cancer cells. The
reason of the Janus-faced role of ERK8 in promotion of
cell growth and cell death may be very complex and cell
type-dependent. Therefore, similar to JNK/c-Jun axis,
depending on the types and magnitude of stimuli, which
can either promote cell death or cell transformation;
suggesting that although EGF (mitogenic stimulus)
or As2O3 (apoptotic stimulus) can both activate the
phosphorylation of ERK8 at Thr175/Tyr177, however, the
relaying downstream targets are crucial in dictating the

NF-κB specific inhibitor, JSH-23, inhibits ERK8
promoted As2O3-induced lung cancer cell death
To further confirm that ERK8 promotes As2O3-induced
lung cancer cell apoptosis mainly and specifically through
IκBα associated NF-kB signaling, the NF-kB specific
inhibitor (JSH-23) was employed. First, NF-kB luciferase
assay was performed to detect the effectiveness of JSH-23 on
the suppression of NF-κB activity. As we can see in Figure
6A, JSH-23 treatment significantly suppressed As2O3-induced
NF-kB luciferase activity in H1299 cells. To correlate the
sensitivity of H1299 cells to As2O3 is due to ERK8 mediated
NF-kB activation, we performed cell viability assay in stable
shMock and shERK8 H1299 cells. As expected, JSH-23
treatment significantly sustained the cell viability of As2O3treated shMock H1299 cells (compare column 3 to column 4
in Figure 6B). In the previous section, since we showed that
knocking down ERK8 significantly suppressed the NF-kB
activity and sustained the cell viability of shERK8 H1299
cells upon As2O3 treatment (Figures 4C and 5C), therefore,
no significant difference in As2O3 sensitivity was observed
at all between JSH-23-untreated or JSH-23-treated shERK8
H1299 cells (compare column 7 to column 8 in Figure 6B).
These data indicate that lowering the ERK8 level alone
is sufficient and reminiscent to reducing the activity of
NF-κB signaling, which ultimately diminished the cellular
sensitivity to As2O3. Altogether, our data suggest that As2O3
is very effective in promoting cell death regulation in high
ERK8-expressing lung cancer cells and we document for
the first time on the interplay of As2O3-ERK8-IκBα-NF-kB
signaling axis.

cell fate that ultimately lead to cell transformation or cell
death. Nevertheless, further study is required to address
these issues to find out the NF-kB dependent genes in
response to As2O3 treatment (besides Fas as we have
demonstrated here) that lead to cell death in high ERK8expressing human lung cancer cells.
In summary, we demonstrate for the first time
a regulatory paradigm of NF-kB activation by ERK8
upon As2O3 treatment and that IκBα is a newly
identified cellular physiological substrate of ERK8.
Given the important role of ERK8 in mediating the
therapeutic efficacy of As2O3 against lung cancer cells,
we suggest that As2O3 (besides its promising role in the
treatment of hematologic malignancies) as a potential
agent in the treatment of lung cancer patients with
high ERK8 expression such that this might gain more
selective killing of cancer cells. Finally, the work we
report here might also implicate the need for ongoing
research on the identification and understanding of
novel signaling circuit(s) in response to As2O3 treatment
in various cancer types, and hopefully shed light in
providing strategies for anti-cancer management.

Materials
Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) and MG132 were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The
NF-kB specific inhibitor JSH-23 (S7351) was purchased
from Selleck (Shanghai, China). The Subcellular Protein
Fractionation Kit for Cultured Cells was from Thermo
Scientific (Rockford, IL). shRNAs were purchased from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). ERK8
shRNA plasmid (h) (sc-77462-SH) is a target-specific
lentiviral vector plasmid encoding a 19–25 nt (plus hairpin)
shRNA to knock down gene expression. Control shRNA
plasmid-A (sc-108060) encodes a scrambled shRNA
sequence that will not lead to the specific degradation of
any known cellular mRNA. All other general chemicals
were purchased from GE Healthcare (Uppsala, Sweden),
Qiagen (Valencia, CA) and Sigma-Aldrich. The pCMV4-3
HA/IκBα (21985) and pRL-SV40P (27163) plasmids were
purchased from Addgene (Cambridge, MA). The 5× kB
luciferase reporter plasmid has been described previously

Figure 7: A model of As2O3 action based on our data is presented. As2O3 treatment induces the phosphorylation of ERK8 and
activated ERK8 subsequently promotes the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, which leads to the activation of NF-κB and lung
cancer cell apoptosis.

Sciences (Shanghai, China) and cultured following the
supplier’s recommended conditions. Cell viability was
measured by MTS or NBB assay as described previously
[8, 28]. Transfection of the expression vectors was
performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) following
the manufacturer’s suggested protocol. For generation of
ERK8 knockdown cells, viral particles were packed with
control or ERK8 shRNA. H1299 cells, grown to about
70% confluence, were infected with the above lentiviral
shRNAs in the presence of 8 µg/ml polybrene for 24 h.
Uninfected cells were eliminated by exposure to 2 µg/ml
puromycin for 4 days before use.

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
In brief, total RNA was extracted from cells
using TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
15596018). cDNA was synthesized using PrimeScript
Reverse Transcriptase (Takara, 2680A) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative real-time
RT-PCR was performed with GoTaq qPCR Master Mix
(A6001) from Promega (Fitchburg, WI) and gene-specific
primers on Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR
System. β-Actin was amplified as internal reference
to normalize gene expression. Relative expression of
genes was calculated using 2 ΔΔCT method as described
previously [29]. Primers were synthesized by Beijing
Genomics Institute with the following sequences: ERK8
(forward: 5′-GACCAGAAGCCGTCCAATGT-3′, reverse:
5′-GTATCGGTGCGAAGAGAGCA-3′); Fas (forward:
5′-TGAAGGACATGGCTTAGAAGTG-3′, reverse: 5′-GG
TGCAAGGGTCACAGTGTT-3′) and β-actin (forward:
5′-ATGGGTCAGAAGGATTCCTATGTG-3′, reverse:
5′-CTTCATGAGGTAGTCAGTCAGGTC-3′).

Construction of ERK8 expression plasmids and
the corresponding mutants
The ERK8 WT and ERK8 K42R were each inserted
into the pET46 Ek/LIC plasmid and expressed as Histagged fusions as described previously [8]. The ERK8
proteins were purified using Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen).
The ERK8 gene coding sequence was also amplified
from pGEX-2T-GST-ERK8 WT by PCR. After restriction
digestion, the ERK8 sequence was ligated to the BamHI/
XbaI site of pcDNA4/HisMaxA to generate the pcDNA4/
Xpress-ERK8. For preparation of GST-IκBα, the IκBα
gene coding sequence was amplified from pCMV4-3
HA/IkB-alpha by PCR. After restriction digestion, the
IkB-alpha sequence was ligated to the EcoRI/NotI site
of pGEX-5X-1 to generate the pGEX-5X-1/GST- IκBα.
The recombinant plasmids were confirmed by DNA
sequencing (Beijing Genomics Institute, Shenzhen,
Guangdong, China).

Cell lysate preparation and conditions of western
blot and immunoprecipitation
After treatment, cells were then washed thrice
with ice-cold PBS, scraped into centrifuge tube, and then
harvested by centrifugation at 1000× g for 5 min at 4°C.
For subcellular protein preparation, the cytoplasmic,
nuclear-soluble, and chromatin-bound fractions were
prepared using the Subcellular Protein Fractionation Kit
for Cultured Cells in accordance with the manufacturer.
For western blot analysis, cell pellets were lysed in
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer according to the
protocol as described previously [28]. Equal amounts
of proteins were fractionated on a SDS-polyacrylamide
gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5%
nonfat dry milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and
probed with various primary antibodies. After incubation
with secondary antibodies, immunoblots were visualized
with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (GE
Healthcare). The normalized target band signal intensities

Cell culture and transfection
