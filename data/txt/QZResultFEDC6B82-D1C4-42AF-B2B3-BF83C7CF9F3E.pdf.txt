BACKGROUND. Nonbilharzial squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the bladder is a
rare entity in the Western hemisphere. To further understanding of its natural
history, a contemporary experience with management and outcome of this disease
was reviewed.

METHODS. Between 1988 and 2003, 27 patients with pure SCC were treated at the
center. Charts were reviewed to assess impact of therapy on survival and patterns
of recurrence in those that died of disease.

RESULTS. The 2-year overall survival and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates
were 47.6% and 32.8%, respectively, with a median follow-up of 15.3 months in
survivors. Eight patients received initial chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy
with the intent of performing surgical consolidation. In 5 of these patients surgical consolidation was not performed due to rapid progression of disease and
death. Of the 3 patients who were treated with neoadjuvant therapy (1 with
chemotherapy, 1 with radiation, and 1 with chemoradiation) and had surgical
consolidation, 2 (67%) were downstaged at cystectomy and remain disease-free.
In 10 of 20 patients who underwent radical cystectomy the disease recurred after
a median duration of 5.1 months and 7 died: 3 of local recurrence, 1 of distant
recurrence, and 3 of both. History of superficial transitional cell carcinoma that
differentiated into pure SCC (P 5 .035; hazards ratio [HR] of 3.73) and treatment
by radical cystectomy (P 5 .002; HR of 0.19) were associated with RFS.

onbilharzial squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the bladder is a
rare malignancy that represents \5% of bladder tumors diagnosed in the Western world.1–3 It is usually associated with chronic
irritation of the bladder from urinary stasis due to bladder outlet
obstruction, recurrent urinary tract infections, stones, or indwelling
catheters.4,5 It has also been associated with exposure to cyclophosphamide.6 In contrast to nonbilharzial SCC, bilharzial SCC is a distinct pathological disease that is rarely encountered in North
America; it is commonly diagnosed at a younger age, typically in
the fifth decade of life, and usually presents as low-grade disease
with a relatively good prognosis. Although many published studies
on SCC include patients with bilharziasis, the natural history and

optimal therapy of patients treated for nonbilharzial
SCC of the bladder is not as well defined and is the
subject of this report.
The majority of patients with nonbilharzial SCC
typically present with a poorly differentiated, muscle-invasive tumor with no previous history of
urothelial carcinoma.2 Less than 10% of patients
present with distant metastasis.7 Even in the absence
of distant metastasis, the prognosis of patients with
nonbilharzial SCC of the bladder remains dismal
because patients usually die after locoregional recurrence. This is in contrast to transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) in which distant metastasis accounts for
the great majority of recurrences.8 In our original
series the 5-year survival rate of patients treated for
SCC of the bladder was only 10.6%.1 In a selected
group of 25 patients treated between 1951 and 1985,
the 5-year actuarial survival of patients with stages
T2 and T3 SCC treated with preoperative radiation
therapy and radical cystectomy increased to 50%.7 It
is believed that this improvement in survival was due
partly to the sterilization of micrometastasis in pelvic
nodes and, hence, better control of local pelvic recurrences. To determine whether the prognosis for
patients with this disease has improved with advancements in patient care, surgical technique, and
neoadjuvant therapies, we retrospectively reviewed
our experience in a contemporary series to gain
insight that might guide future approaches to management of this disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval,
we reviewed the charts of all 27 patients who were
diagnosed with nonbilharzial pure SCC of the bladder at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from January 1988 to December 2003.
Transurethral resection (TUR) was performed for
diagnostic purposes and bimanual examination under
anesthesia was performed after the TUR to determine
the clinical stage of disease in each patient. By our
definition the absence of induration or a palpable
mass indicates either a noninvasive or a superficially
invasive tumor (T2), the presence of induration indicates deep muscle invasion (T2), the palpation of a
discrete, mobile 3-dimensional mass implies deep
invasion into extravesical tissue (T3), whereas a mass
that is fixed to the pelvic sidewall is staged as T4b.
Each patient had a preoperative metastatic workup
that included blood tests, chest x-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis, and
bone scan (if clinically indicated). After treatment,
patients were followed with physical examination, se-

rum chemistries, routine chest x-rays, CT scans of the
abdomen and pelvis, and bone scans (if indicated) to
assess for recurrence of disease. Reviewed data included
age, sex, presence of risk factors associated with SCC
of the bladder (such as bladder outlet obstruction,
stones, indwelling urinary catheters, recurrent urinary
tract infections, and cyclophosphamide exposure),
clinical stage of disease, presence of hydronephrosis,
history of prior superficial TCC, tumor histology, pathologic stage of disease, neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant
therapy, surgical margin status, disease recurrence,
site of recurrence, and survival. Study endpoints were
overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS),
and recurrence-free survival (RFS).
Median survival was estimated using the KaplanMeier method. A Cox proportional hazards regression
model was used to test the statistical significance of
several potential prognostic factors for OS, DSS, and
RFS. All potential prognostic factors with a Pvalue <.25 from the univariate analysis were then
included in a saturated model and backward elimination was used to remove factors from the model
based on the likelihood ratio test in the multiple
regression analysis. Locoregional and distant recurrences of disease were modeled as time varying covariates for OS and DSS.

RESULTS
Patient demographics and clinical features are shown
in Table 1. Clinical stages were T2 (13 patients), T3b
(9 patients), and T4b (5 patients). Patients were treated as follows: 17 patients underwent radical cystectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy alone (7 cT3b, 10
cT2), 1 patient received neoadjuvant radiation followed by cystectomy (cT2), 1 patient received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by cystectomy (cT3b),
1 patient received neoadjuvant chemoradiation fol-

(cT2), 4 patients received radiation therapy and
chemotherapy combined (cT4b), and 1 patient underwent TUR alone (cT4b).
With a median follow-up period of 15.3 months
(range, 5–129 months) for survivors, 14 (51.9%)
patients had died from SCC of the bladder. Eight
patients received initial chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy: 4 in the neoadjuvant setting and 4 with
initially surgically unresectable disease (cT4b) with
the hope of performing surgical consolidation in the
face of an adequate response to therapy. None of the
patients with initial unresectable disease were converted to a surgically resectable status with definitive
chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Of the 4
patients treated in the neoadjuvant setting, 1 patient
(with cT3b disease) treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not resected secondary to rapid progression to an unresectable state. Of the 3 patients in
whom surgical consolidation was attempted, 1
patient (with cT3b disease) had received neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, 1 patient (with cT2 disease) had
received neoadjuvant radiation therapy, and 1 patient
(with cT2 disease) had received neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Two of these patients (67%) had tumors
that were downstaged at the time of cystectomy;
they remained disease-free after a follow-up duration
of 5 months and 47 months, respectively. Of these 2
patients (1 cT2 and 1 cT3b), 1 received neoadjuvant
chemotherapy (cisplatin, gemcitabine, and ifosfamide) and the other received cisplatin plus irradiation. One patient (with cT2 disease) was not a
candidate for surgery because of severe comorbid-

(with cT4b disease) underwent TUR alone and died
of locoregional and metastatic disease before additional therapy could be administered. Table 2 lists
the demographics and clinical characteristics of the
20 patients who underwent radical cystectomy.
The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the 2-year OS,
DSS, and RFS rates in the overall study group were
47.6%, 47.6%, and 32.8%, respectively (Fig. 1). The

superficial TCC that differentiated into pure SCC
(P 5 .035; HR of 3.73 [95% confidence interval (95%
CI), 1.1–12.66]) and treatment by radical cystectomy
(P 5 .002; HR of 0.19 [95% CI, 0.06–0.55]). The median survival duration of patients with a history of
previous superficial TCC was 6.9 months versus 25.1
months for those who presented with a primary SCC.
Of the 27 patients, 20 underwent radical cystectomy. The pathologic stages represented were pT0 (2
patients), pT2 (7 patients), and pT3 (11 patients). Of
note, despite having pure SCC on the cystectomy
specimen, the preoperative biopsy on TUR in 5 of 20
patients was reported as TCC with squamous differentiation. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the 2-year OS,
DSS, and RFS rates in patients who underwent radical
cystectomy were 66.1%, 66.1%, and 44.4%, respectively. The median survival duration of patients that
did not undergo radical cystectomy either because of
disease progression or intended bladder preservation
was 5 months, whereas the median survival was not
reached in patients who underwent radical cystec-

tomy. Among patients who underwent cystectomy
without preoperative chemotherapy or irradiation,
clinical staging correlated with pathologic staging in
53% of cases, whereas 27% had been understaged and
20% overstaged. In 10 patients (50%) the disease
recurred after a median postsurgery time of 5.1
months; 7 of them died from the disease (3 died with
local recurrence, 1 with distant recurrence, and 3 with
both). Thus, local recurrence occurred in 6 of the 7
patients who died after radical cystectomy, and only 1
of them had positive surgical margins. Locoregional
recurrence (P 5 .014; HR of 15.25 [95% CI, 1.72–
135.2]) was significantly associated with shorter OS
and DSS on multivariate analysis among patients who
underwent radical cystectomy. Although higher pathologic stage was associated with shorter OS, DSS, and
RFS (P < .01), it was not significantly associated with
survival on multivariate analysis in this small number
of patients. Details regarding characteristics of
patients, treatment, and disease status are described
in Table 4.

DISCUSSION
Our 2-year OS rate of 47.6% is consistent with results
previously reported,1,3,7,9,10 and all of those who survived underwent cystectomy as part of their therapy.
The majority of deaths resulted from locoregional
failure. In 10 patients local recurrence developed after
radical cystectomy. Seven of these patients died.
History of previous superficial TCC that underwent
variant differentiation into pure SCC and treatment
by radical cystectomy were significantly associated
with RFS on multivariate analysis.
Published results after definitive local treatment
by external irradiation alone consistently report poor
outcome.2,11 Radical cystectomy appears to provide
better patient outcome, although the failure rate with
this modality is also considerable. The benefit of preoperative irradiation has been evaluated in several
uncontrolled series and 5-year survival rates between
34% and 50% have been reported.1,7,12 The patients
who benefited most were those whose tumors were
downstaged by preoperative radiation therapy. Unfortunately, downstaging was more likely to occur in
patients with clinically organ-confined disease in
which the benefit of preoperative therapy is not as
clear. Extrapolating from our experience with TCC,
neoadjuvant chemotherapy was more beneficial in
those with locally advanced tumors.13,14
In recent years we treated more patients with
squamous tumors with preoperative chemotherapy
or chemoradiation than with preoperative radiation
therapy. Those with surgically unresectable disease
(cT4b) are treated therapeutically with chemotherapy  radiation and are considered for cystectomy
only if they had a significant response to initial therapy. Four patients received neoadjuvant therapy with
the intent of performing surgical consolidation once
treatment was complete; however, only 3 underwent
cystectomy: 1 patient with a cT2 lesion after radiation therapy, 1 with cT3b lesion after chemotherapy,
and 1 with cT2 lesion after chemoradiation. In 2
patients the tumor was downstaged, 1 received
neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin,
gemcitabine, and ifosfamide and the other received
combined cisplatin with radiation therapy. Both
patients remain disease-free after follow-up durations of 5 and 47 months, respectively. These findings
are consistent with our previous experience in which
we reported that patients who were downstaged by
neoadjuvant radiation therapy demonstrated durable
response to therapy.7 Unfortunately, none of our
patients with surgically unresectable, locally advanced disease (cT4b) were downstaged by combined chemoradiation and their disease progressed
on therapy.

A limitation of our study is that it is a retrospective review and that all patients were treated at a single institution. We acknowledge that it is impossible
to definitively identify an optimal therapeutic strategy from a retrospective study. It is difficult to draw
definitive conclusions regarding the benefit of preoperative therapy for SCC because of the small sample
size; the multivariate analysis should be interpreted
with caution. However, because patients with favorable tumors are more likely to experience downstaging after preoperative therapy, the question that
remains unanswered is, does downstaging by preoperative chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or both
actually provide any real significant therapeutic benefit or does response to preoperative therapy merely
reflect the natural history of a less aggressive neoplasm? Regrettably, SCC of the bladder is resistant to
various chemotherapeutic agents, and we are unaware of any multiagent regimen that is consistently
effective against the disease. The lack of consistent
response to neoadjuvant therapy suggests that
patients with surgically resectable disease should
receive radical cystectomy, and those with more
advanced disease should be treated with a regimen
that has been consistently successful in the treatment of SCC at other sites. In the absence of effective therapy, locoregional failures of SCC of the
bladder will continue to be the primary cause of
death in these patients.

Conclusions
In select patients, radical cystectomy remains the
mainstay of therapy for nonbilharzial SCC of the
bladder. Locoregional recurrence is the primary
cause of death in these patients. Due to the rarity of
this disease, multicenter prospective phase 2 trials
are necessary to identify an effective approach to
treatment of advanced disease.
