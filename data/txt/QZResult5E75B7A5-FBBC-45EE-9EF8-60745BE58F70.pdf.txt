Abstract
Targeted therapies have yet to have signiﬁcant impact on the survival of patients with bladder cancer. In this
study, we focused on the urea cycle enzyme argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1) as a therapeutic target in
bladder cancer, based on our discovery of the prognostic and functional import of ASS1 in this setting. ASS1
expression status in bladder tumors from 183 Caucasian and 295 Asian patients was analyzed, along with its
hypothesized prognostic impact and association with clinicopathologic features, including tumor size and
invasion. Furthermore, the genetics, biology, and therapeutic implications of ASS1 loss were investigated in
urothelial cancer cells. We detected ASS1 negativity in 40% of bladder cancers, in which multivariate analysis
indicated worse disease-speciﬁc and metastasis-free survival. ASS1 loss secondary to epigenetic silencing was
accompanied by increased tumor cell proliferation and invasion, consistent with a tumor-suppressor role for
ASS1. In developing a treatment approach, we identiﬁed a novel targeted antimetabolite strategy to exploit
arginine deprivation with pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20) as a therapeutic. ADI-PEG20 was synthetically lethal in ASS1-methylated bladder cells and its exposure was associated with a marked reduction in
intracellular levels of thymidine, due to suppression of both uptake and de novo synthesis. We found that
thymidine uptake correlated with thymidine kinase-1 protein levels and that thymidine levels were imageable
with [18F]-ﬂuoro-L-thymidine (FLT)–positron emission tomography (PET). In contrast, inhibition of de novo
synthesis was linked to decreased expression of thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase. Notably,
inhibition of de novo synthesis was associated with potentiation of ADI-PEG20 activity by the antifolate drug
pemetrexed. Taken together, our ﬁndings argue that arginine deprivation combined with antifolates warrants
clinical investigation in ASS1-negative urothelial and related cancers, using FLT-PET as an early surrogate marker
of response. Cancer Res; 74(3); 896–907. 2013 AACR.

Prognostic and Predictive Role of ASS1 Loss in Bladder Cancer

oncology—targeted therapies have been ineffective to date in
this disease (3).
Recently, arginine auxotrophy or the absolute requirement
for exogenous arginine for cellular growth has been detected in
several chemoresistant solid cancers, including hepatocellular
carcinoma, melanoma, mesothelioma, and prostate cancer
(4–6). Arginine fuels an array of biosynthetic reactions, including proteins, nitric oxide (NO), polyamines, agmatine, and the
amino acids proline and glutamate, and therefore may modulate tumorigenesis at multiple levels (7). Inactivation of the
pleiotropic enzyme, argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1),
with key roles in the urea cycle, citrulline–NO cycle, and
arginine biosynthesis has emerged as a principal driver of
tumoral arginine auxotrophy, with evidence for epigenetic
silencing and hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a)–mediated
transcriptional repression of ASS1 (5, 8, 9). Signiﬁcantly, ASS1
loss has been associated with decreased overall survival in
ovarian cancer and myxoﬁbrosarcoma, and reduced metastasis-free survival in osteosarcoma, implicating a tumor-suppressor function for this metabolic gene (10–12). Thus, arginine deprivation is being tested increasingly in the clinic,
modeled on the successful introduction of another amino acid
depletor, namely asparaginase, in the management of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia ﬁve decades ago (13). Speciﬁcally,
several early-phase trials of the arginine-degrading mycoplasmal enzyme, pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20), have
led to phase II/III randomized studies in melanoma, hepatocellular cancer, and mesothelioma (14–16).
Here, we characterized ASS1 in bladder cancer based on the
fact that loss of chromosome 9, including q34, the locus of ASS1,
is a known early event in urothelial tumorigenesis (17). Previously, Linnenbach and colleagues provided evidence for a
truncation mutation at the ASS1 locus in a ureteric carcinoma
sample, while searching for tumor suppressors at 9q34 (18).
Here, we show that ASS1 negativity is a common event in
bladder cancer detected in approximately 40% of tumors by
immunohistochemistry (IHC). Furthermore, to address a putative tumor-suppressor role, we performed additional genetic
and epigenetic studies of ASS1 using a panel of bladder cancer
cell lines. Finally, we studied the therapeutic consequences of
ASS1 loss in bladder cancer, identifying a novel targeted
antimetabolite strategy that combines arginine deprivation
with the antifolate, pemetrexed. These studies were reinforced
by metabolomic and positron emission tomography (PET)
tracer analyses, which identify intracellular thymidine levels
as a novel biomarker of early treatment response.

Materials and Methods
Primary tumor characteristics
Tissue microarrays (TMA) were constructed using a training
set of biopsy samples, comprising 183 urothelial carcinomas
collected at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Research
Institute (19), and an independent test set of 295 urothelial
carcinomas, which were resected consecutively with curative
intent in Chi Mei Medical Center, Taiwan, between January
1996 and March 2004. Institutional review boards in the United
Kingdom (Cambridgeshire Local Research Ethics Committee)

www.aacrjournals.org

and Taiwan (IRB971006) ratiﬁed the tissue procurement. The
diagnostic criteria were based on the updated American Joint
Committee on Cancer Staging.
IHC
ASS1 IHC was performed using liver control sections as
described previously (5). The scoring of thymidylate synthase
(TS; 1:100, Clone EPR4545; Epitomics) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR;1:100, Clone EPR5285; Epitomics) was performed
using an H-score, determined by the percentage and intensity
of positively stained tumor cells with cases stratiﬁed according
to high (no less than the median score) or low expression (less
than the median score; ref. 20).
Cell lines and culture
Six bladder cancer cell lines were grown in a humidiﬁed
atmosphere at 37 C and 5% CO2 in endotoxin-free RPMI medium
with 10% FBS (RT112, 5637, SCaBER, 253J, and T24) or Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS (UMUC3). The
arginine concentration was approximately 10-fold higher in the
culture medium than found in human serum (i.e., 1 mmol/L vs.
0.06–0.1 mmol/L, respectively). Experiments were performed
using cells at 70% conﬂuency, which were harvested for analysis
of ASS1 promoter methylation, constitutive ASS1 mRNA, and
protein. Studies of corroborative cell lines in a nonurothelial solid
cancer (mesothelioma) were performed and all cell lines were
authenticated by short tandem repeat proﬁling (LGC Standards).
Methylation-speciﬁc PCR
One microgram of genomic DNA was modiﬁed with sodium
bisulphite using the EZ DNA methylation kit (Zymo) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. Then, 50 ng of modiﬁed
DNA was ampliﬁed using the following primers designed using
the ASS1 promoter sequence: UF (50 GTAGGAGGGAAGGGGTTTTT); UR (50 ACAAAAAACAAATAACCCAAA); MF (50
GTAGGAGGGAAGGGGTTTTC); and MR (50 GCAAAAAACAAATAACCCGAA), in which U ¼ unmethylated and M ¼
methylated. Control CpGenome universal methylated and
unmethylated DNA were obtained from Merck Millipore.
Pyrosequencing
Methylation in the -C-phosphate-G- (CpG) islands of the
ASS1 gene in the urothelial cell line panel was also analyzed
using pyrosequencing technology. For pyrosequencing of the
parafﬁn primary bladder cancer samples, PCR ampliﬁcation
and sequencing primers were optimized using the PyroMark
Assay Design Software 2.0. Details of PCR primers and conditions are available on request.
Sequencing analysis
The coding exons and ﬂanking sequences of ASS1 were
analyzed by Sanger sequencing in forward and reverse in the
panel of bladder cancer cell lines. Details of PCR primers and
conditions are available on request.
Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR
Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen)
and reverse-transcribed with the High Capacity cDNA Reverse
Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the

manufacturer's instructions. Multiplex PCR was performed on
an ABI Prism 7500 Real-Time PCR Instrument (Applied Biosystems). Primers and TaqMan probes for ASS1 (FAM) and 18S
(VIC) were obtained from Applied Biosystems (TaqMan Gene
Expression Assays).
ASS1 overexpression and knockdown
ASS1 overexpression was performed in 253J, UMUC-3, and
T24 bladder cancer cells using ASS1pIREShyg3 (or control)
vector under hygromycin (200 mg/mL) selection, as described
previously (10). ASS1 knockdown in 5637 bladder cancer cells
was performed using the pSilencer 4.1-CMVpuro vector
(Ambion) containing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences
targeting ASS1 (SMARTpool; Dharmacon) or a nontargeting
control shRNA under puromycin (1 mg/mL) selection.
Proliferation assays
Brieﬂy, 3  104 cells were suspended in 200 mL of serum-free
DMEM, plated into a 96-well plate, and incubated for 48 hours.
Subsequently, 40 mL of CellTitre Aqueous One solution (Promega, G3580) was added to each well and the plate was
incubated for between 15 minutes to 1 hour before reading
at 450 nm (Labtech, LT4000MS).
Invasion assays
Brieﬂy, transwells (Corning, 3422) were coated with Matrigel
(BD Bioscience, 354234) diluted 1:3 with serum-free DMEM
and allowed to set for 1 hour at 37 C. Transwells were placed in
the wells of a 24-well plate containing 500 mL of DMEM (PAA)
with 10% serum. 3  104 cells in 200 mL of serum-free DMEM
were plated into the top of the transwell, and incubated at 37 C
for 48 hours. Transwells were removed from the DMEM þ 10%
FBS and placed into 500 mL of Trypsin/EDTA (PAA) for 1 hour
at 37 C. The undersides of transwells were then washed with
trypsin and the cell suspension transferred to 9.5 mL of Isoton
and the number of cells quantiﬁed on a CASY counter. All
experiments were repeated at least three times using quintuplicate readings.
Immunoblotting
Western blot analysis for ASS1 (BD Biosciences) was performed as described previously (5). Membranes were also
probed for TS (Sigma-Aldrich), DHFR, TK1 (Abcam), p53R2
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PARP (Signal Transduction),
b-actin, and Hsc70.
Drug treatments
Arginine depletion experiments were performed using ADIPEG20 (Polaris Group) and 2% dialyzed FBS (>10 KDa, Autogen
Bioclear). Cell viability was measured using the MTT assay
according to manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics).
Pemetrexed (Eli Lilly and Company) was purchased from Barts
Chemopharmacy. Combination drug treatments of ADIPEG20 and pemetrexed were studied using the Chou-Talalay
methodology and the effect on tumor cell apoptosis was
detected using PARP cleavage (Cell Signaling Technology) and
Annexin V staining (21). Proteosome inhibition and demethylation experiments were performed using MG132 (1 mmol/L;

Cancer Res; 74(3) February 1, 2014

Sigma-Aldrich) and 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC, 0.1–1
mmol/L; Sigma-Aldrich), respectively.
Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry
PBS control and ADI-PEG20 treated cells (3  106) were
washed twice with phosphate buffer saline and then harvested
by adding 10 mL of ice-cold 80% methanol containing 0.1%
formic acid (all reagents from Fisher Scientiﬁc). Cell extracts
were prepared using a standard protocol and injected into the
liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) system.
LC was performed using the nanoACQUITY UltraPerformance
(UP) LC system (Waters) and MS was executed using a Waters
Q-ToF Premier operated in positive and negative electrospray
ionization modes. Data acquisition and analysis were performed using the Water Masslynx software (V 4.1) and MZmine
software (version 2.2), respectively. Peak lists, including retention, M/Z, and peak intensities, were exported from MZmine
and imported into Microsoft Ofﬁce Excel 2007, revealing
volcano plots and the fold change and P value for individual
metabolites. Subsequent targeted metabolomic analysis was
performed in the positive ion mode.
In vitro tracer uptake assays
Cells were plated at 1  105 cells per well the evening before
the experiment. The next day cells were incubated with ADIPEG20 (750 ng/mL). On the day of the assay, the drug media
were removed and incubated in media supplemented with
2% dialyzed FBS for 1 hour. [3H] thymidine was then added at 1
mci/mL to each well and incubated for a further 1 hour. Cells
were then washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and harvested with
trypsin. The cell lysates were collected and added to tubes
containing 2 mL of scintillation ﬂuid and the cell-associated 3H
radioactivity was measured using the b scintillation counter
(LKB Instruments). The radioactivity uptake in nmoles was
normalized to the number of viable cells to give pmole uptake
per 10,000 live cells and expressed relative to untreated controls. All experiments were done in triplicate and repeated 3
times.
In vivo experiments
UMUC-3 cells (1  107 in 0.1 mL) were implanted into the
ﬂank of CD1 nu/nu mice and developed into visible tumors by
11 days. For the in vivo [18F]-ﬂuoro-L-thymidine (FLT)–PET
studies, animals (n ¼ 5) were injected i.v. via the tail vein with 15
to 18 MBq of [18F]-FLT and imaged using an Inveon microPET/
CT (Siemens) before and 24 hours after treatment with ADIPEG20 (5 IU). Standardized uptake values (SUV) were calculated
by dividing the activity concentration in each voxel by the
injected dose and dividing by the animal weight. For drug
combination studies, mice were separated into four intraperitoneal (i.p.) treatment groups (n ¼ 11 per group): PBS control
(days 1 and 8), ADI-PEG20 (5 IU on days 1 and 8), pemetrexed
(PEM; 100 mg/kg on days 2–4 and 9–11); and ADI-PEG20 (5 IU
on days 1 and 8) plus PEM (100 mg/kg on days 2–4 and 9–11).
Tumor volume and animal weights were recorded and all mice
were sacriﬁced on day 11; tumors were collected and stored for
immunohistochemical analyses. Additional 18F-FLT microPET/
CT imaging was performed in female UMUC3 bladder cancer

Results
Loss of ASS1 confers poor survival in bladder cancer
First, we screened for ASS1 expression in a training set bladder
cancer TMA derived from a European population revealing that
45% (83 of 183) of biopsies were ASS1-negative. The validation
TMA (Fig. 1A–F) from an Asian population yielded similar
results with 37% of bladder cancer cases (108 of 295) being
ASS1-negative. ASS1 negativity conferred a poor disease-speciﬁc
(P ¼ 0.011) and metastasis-free survival (P ¼ 0.001) on multivariate analysis (Fig. 1G and H and Table 1). Furthermore, ASS1
loss was linked to several adverse clinicopathologic features,
including increased tumor size and grade, lymph node involvement, and vascular invasion (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).
Methylated ASS1 is linked to increased proliferation and
invasion of bladder cancer cells
To understand the regulation of ASS1 expression and its role
in urothelial malignancy, we screened six bladder carcinoma cell
lines for genomic and epigenetic alterations. FISH analysis
conﬁrmed all lines were either triploid or tetraploid with the
ASS1 locus intact (data not shown). There were no mutations in
ASS1 and no loss of heterozygosity in the region immediately
surrounding ASS1 (data not shown). Instead, the UMUC-3 and
253J cell lines were fully methylated, whereas the T24 line was
partially methylated at the ASS1 promoter, with negligible ASS1
mRNA and no ASS1 protein. In contrast, all the ASS1-unmethylated cell lines (SCaBER, RT112, and 5637) expressed ASS1 mRNA
and protein (Fig. 2A). Notably, ASS1 promoter methylation was
greatest in UMUC-3 and 253J compared with the T24 cell line by

900

pyrosequencing of six CpG islands within the ASS1 promoter. In
contrast, the ASS1-positive bladder cancer cell lines were
unmethylated by pyrosequencing validating the results obtained
with MS-PCR (Fig. 2B). The demethylating agent decitabine
reexpressed ASS1 protein in 253J, UMUC-3, and T24 cells, conﬁrming epigenetic silencing as a key mechanism involved in ASS1
inactivation in bladder cancer cells (data not shown; ref. 22).
To determine the correlation between immunohistochemical expression of ASS1 and methylation status, tissue blocks of
an independent set of 30 urothelial carcinomas with a high
tumor cell content (>70%) were selected for pyrosequencing.
Following optimization of primers for parafﬁn-embedded tissue, only one ASS1-positive tumor had an average methylation
value of 45% that was greater than the threshold value of 40%
(Supplementary Fig. S1). The remaining tumors with methylation values >40% were all negative for ASS1 immunoexpression
(P < 0.001), validating the role of promoter methylation in ASS1
silencing in primary bladder cancer (Supplementary Table S3).
Next, we addressed the signiﬁcance of epigenetic loss of
ASS1 in bladder cancer by manipulating ASS1 in our panel of
urothelial cancer cell lines. Although ASS1 overexpression
decreased the proliferation of 253J and UMUC-3 cells, ASS1
siRNA increased the proliferation of 5637 cells, consistent with
a tumor-suppressor role for ASS1 in urothelium (Fig. 2C). We
also observed a reciprocal relationship between ASS1 expression and cell invasion by performing matrigel invasion assays,
conﬁrming that ASS1 loss increased the invasiveness of urothelial tumor cells in vitro (Fig. 2D).
ASS1-methylated bladder cancer cell lines are sensitive to
ADI-PEG20
To test the effect of arginine deprivation on bladder cancer
cell line viability, we treated the panel of bladder cancer cell
lines with the arginine depletor, ADI-PEG20. All ASS1-negative

Prognostic and Predictive Role of ASS1 Loss in Bladder Cancer

5637, SCaBER, and RT112 cells were unmethylated, consistent with the MS-PCR data. C, overexpressing (O/E; inset) ASS1 in UMUC-3 and 253J cell
lines resulted in a signiﬁcant (5%–20%) reduction in proliferation, respectively; in contrast, knockdown of endogenous ASS1 (inset) in 5637 cells caused a
signiﬁcant 20% increase in proliferation.  , P < 0.0001 (three independent experiments). D, overexpression of ASS1 in 253J and UMUC-3 cell lines
caused a signiﬁcant (50% and 75%, respectively) reduction of invasion, whereas knockdown of endogenous ASS1 in 5637 cells resulted in a signiﬁcant (75%)
increase in invasion.  , P < 0.0001 (three independent experiments). Con, control empty vector cells.

cell lines were sensitive to ADI-PEG20 with the highly methylated lines 253J and UMUC-3 displaying the greatest sensitivity to arginine depletion; in contrast, the ASS1-positive cell
lines 5637, RT112, and SCaBER were resistant to ADI-PEG20
(Fig. 3A). Moreover, forced ASS1 overexpression in ASS1-negative cell lines reduced their sensitivity to ADI-PEG20, validating the role of ASS1 loss in mediating the synthetic lethal effect
to arginine deprivation (Fig. 3B).
ADI-PEG20 inhibits pyrimidine metabolism in
ASS1-negative tumor cells
We proceeded to analyze the metabolic effects of ADI-PEG20
and conﬁrmed a signiﬁcant decrease in intracellular arginine
with a corresponding increase in citrulline in ASS1-negative
bladder cancer cells. Marked reductions in thymidine and
increases in thymine and glutamine were also detected by

www.aacrjournals.org

LC/MS (Fig. 4A). In contrast, ADI-PEG20 reduced arginine levels
to a minor extent in the ASS1-positive RT112 control cell line,
whereas intracellular levels of thymidine, thymine, and glutamine were unaffected, indicating a nonessential role for exogenous arginine. Because of these differential effects on intracellular thymidine, we interrogated gene pathways modulated by
ADI-PEG20, identifying downregulation of the folate-dependent
nucleotide synthesizing enzymes TS and DHFR speciﬁcally in
ASS1-negative tumor cells (data not shown). Marked suppression of DHFR and TS mRNA and protein was detected in all three
ADI-sensitive bladder cancer cell lines whereas no effect was
seen in the RT112 control cell line exposed to ADI-PEG20 (Fig. 4B
and C). We also analyzed the thymidine salvage pathway, as a
compensatory source of cellular thymidine upon suppression of
de novo pyrimidine synthesis. Unexpectedly, ADI-PEG20 also
reduced 3H-thymidine uptake in the arginine-auxotrophic cell

between arginine auxotrophy and modulation of nucleotide
biosynthesis (Supplementary Fig. S3 and S4; and Supplementary Table S1). Thus, we hypothesized that ADI-PEG20 may
potentiate the cytotoxicity of pemetrexed in ASS1-negative
tumor cells via modulation of folate-dependent enzymes. First,
we showed that pemetrexed and ADI-PEG20 enhanced apoptosis compared with either agent alone by increasing PARP
cleavage and Annexin V binding in vitro in ASS1-methylated
tumor cell lines (Fig. 5A and B). Secondly, ADI-PEG20 significantly reduced tumor growth of the UMUC-3 cell line (P <
0.001) in xenografted nude mice. Although pemetrexed alone
had no effect, the combination was more effective than ADIPEG20 alone (P < 0.05; Fig. 5C and D). Analysis of tumors from
the xenograft studies conﬁrmed reduced TS, DHFR, and TK1
levels in ADI-PEG20–treated animals (Fig. 5E). Finally, to
validate our results we executed an [18F]-FLT microPET/CT
imaging study of the combination therapy in the UMUC-3
xenograft tumor model. Our SUVmax data showing the superior efﬁcacy of the ADI-PEG20 and pemetrexed drug combination over that of ADI-PEG20 alone are consistent with our
earlier tumor volumetric measurements (Fig. 5F). Notably,
there was a lack of effect on SUVmax of pemetrexed in animals
that had not been pretreated with ADI-PEG20.
Figure 3. ADI-PEG20 is cytotoxic to ASS1-methylated bladder cancer cell
lines. A, bladder cancer cell line viability following exposure to varying

days. B, overexpression of ASS1 in ASS1-methylated cell lines induced

marked in the T24 cell line, validating ASS1 loss as a biomarker of
sensitivity to arginine deprivation.

lines associated with downregulation of thymidine kinase 1
(TK1; ref. 23), with no effect in RT112 control cells (Fig. 4D and
E). Notably, cotreatment with MG132, a proteosome inhibitor
that blocks protein degradation, abrogated the ADI-PEG20–
induced suppression of TS and TK1 levels (Fig. 4F). More
generally, similar data on thymidine salvage and de novo synthesis pathways were obtained in a panel of ADI-treated ASS1negative (methylated) mesothelioma cell lines (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Finally, we assessed whether in vivo imaging of thymidine uptake could provide an early biomarker of response to
ADI-PEG20 therapy using UMUC-3 xenografts. Consistent with
our in vitro studies, there was a 66% decrease in the maximum
standardized uptake value (SUVmax) on [18F]FLT-PET after 24
hours of ADI-PEG20 therapy (Fig. 4G).
Enhanced effect of ADI-PEG20 and pemetrexed in
bladder cancer
To exploit our ﬁndings in the clinic, we used the multitargeted antifolate pemetrexed, which blocks enzymes, including TS and DHFR, and is reported to have modest activity in
bladder cancer (24). High TS expression, in particular, has been
linked to poor clinical outcome and resistance to antifolates in
cancers of the bladder, lung, mesothelium, and colon (25–29).
Moreover, bladder TMA analysis revealed that ASS1 loss was
associated with a reciprocal increase in TS and DHFR expression—both linked to poor outcome for disease-speciﬁc and
metastasis-free survival—emphasizing the interdependence

Discussion
Progress in the targeted therapy of advanced urothelial
carcinoma has lagged behind other urological malignancies,
especially prostate and renal cancer. For the ﬁrst time, we have
identiﬁed ASS1 as a novel bladder cancer biomarker with wider
implications for the therapy and monitoring of cancers dependent on exogenous arginine for survival. We show that despite
exhibiting a poorer prognosis, ASS1-negative bladder cancer is
amenable to dual targeting with ADI-PEG20 and antifolates
with early treatment response monitoring by [18F]FLT-PET.
Our bladder cancer cell line studies reveal that unmethylated ASS1 functions as a bona ﬁde tumor suppressor and is
consistent with recent studies in osteosarcomas and myxoﬁbrosarcomas (11, 12). Exactly how ASS1 promoter methylation
leads to a requirement for exogenous arginine, which promotes
increased tumor cell proliferation and invasion is unclear.
Interestingly, previous studies have associated exogenous
arginine with DNA synthesis in Burkitt lymphoma cells and
with increased proliferation of caco-2 colon cancer cells via a
glutamine-dependent effect (30, 31). Yamauchi and colleagues
proposed that under conditions of limited arginine supply
intracellular glutamine is diverted for arginine synthesis as
supplying exogenous arginine was shown to promote nucleotide synthesis. We found for the ﬁrst time that upon depletion
of arginine in ASS1-negative tumor cells, glutamine levels
increased indicative of a block on nucleotide synthesis. Thus,
our metabolomic experiments with ADI-PEG20 support the
hypothesis that the ASS1 epimutation reprograms extracellular
arginine so that it is sparing for glutamine in nucleotide
metabolism. Additional metabolomic ﬂux studies are under
way to explore further the interdependence of arginine and
glutamine in the context of tumoral ASS1-deﬁciency. Exogenous arginine has also been shown to stimulate intestinal cell

RT112 control treated with ADI-PEG20 (750 ng/mL) for 24 hours were subjected to metabolomic analysis by LC/MS. Arginine decreased in all cell lines;
however, the reduction was at least 1-log fold greater in the ASS1-negative tumor cells. Glutamine and thymine increased whereas thymidine

motility via activation of NO and focal adhesion kinase signaling (32, 33). In particular, arginine is a dominant amino acid
modulator of mTOR, a nodal pathway that integrates cell
growth, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of various
cancers, including urothelial malignancy (34–36); moreover,
arginine deprivation has been shown to repress mTOR and its
downstream substrates p70 S6 kinase and 4E-BP1 in ASS1negative cancer cells (6, 37). Indeed, it is becoming clear that

arginine deprivation has multiple effects on gene expression
and that this is likely to be determined not only by cell type but
also by the status of the ASS1 gene (38).
The ADI-PEG20–induced suppression of the folate-dependent enzymes TS and DHFR and sensitization of ASS1-negative
tumor cells to the cytotoxic effects of pemetrexed provide a
novel metabolic approach to retargeting cytotoxic chemotherapy (39). Our results also validate the work of Cheng and

colleagues, who showed that the irreversible TS inhibitor 5ﬂuorouracil was more effective when combined with pegylated
human arginase in a hepatocellular carcinoma xenograft (40).
It is noteworthy that the ADI-PEG20 and antifolate doublet has
a wide therapeutic window in the xenograft studies. Moreover,
our experience from an ongoing clinical trial of arginine
depletion in mesothelioma (NCT01279967) includes a patient
treated concurrently with ADI-PEG20 and the antifolate methotrexate for an unrelated condition; the combination was safe
and led to a prolonged period of disease control (manuscript in
preparation) (51).
Furthermore, the decreased uptake of thymidine following
ADI-PEG20 treatment as shown by the 3H-thymidine and FLT
tracer studies may be exploited as an early therapeutic biomarker for imaging ASS1-methylated tumors. This is in contrast
to recent work with ADI-PEG20 in ASS1-negative melanoma
xenografts in which there was no effect on TK1 expression and
FLT-PET metabolic responses were not detected (41). These and
previous results using 2[18F]ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose tracers
may be explained in part by the differential regulation of ASS1
promoter with HIF-1a–mediated repression in melanoma compared with epigenetic silencing identiﬁed in several other
arginine auxotrophic cancers (9, 16, 42).
Thus, arginine deprivation with ADI-PEG20 suppresses both
the de novo and salvage pathways of nucleotide synthesis in
ASS1-negative bladder cancer cells, which may be exploited for
therapy and imaging, respectively (Fig. 6). In addition to ADIPEG20 modulating protein turnover as indicated by the
MG132-mediated recovery of TS and TK1 enzymes, several
other mechanisms may underlie the reduced levels of target
proteins, including chemical attack by peroxynitrite, a potent
oxidant and nitrating species generated by arginine deprivation (43–45). More generally, the reciprocal relationship
between thymidine and glutamine in ASS1-negative tumors
reinforces several other preclinical approaches targeting ami-

no acid utilization in cancer, including methionine, glycine,
and serine (46–49). Signiﬁcantly, we observed that ASS1 downregulation was linked to the reciprocal upregulation of the
serine biosynthetic pathway enzymes, PHGDH, PSAT1, and
PSPH, in bladder cancer (data not shown), and this warrants
further evaluation in view of the important roles of serine in
tumor cell proliferation and bioenergetics.
In conclusion, our studies linking the biology of arginine
auxotrophic bladder cancer to adverse clinicopathologic variables accentuate ASS1 loss as a novel biomarker for evaluation
in patients with urothelial cancer. Speciﬁcally, targeted modulation of pyrimidine synthesis—via suppression of the de novo
and salvage nucleotide pathways—using arginine-depleting
drugs combined with antifolates has the potential to improve
the management of urothelial and related cancers with methylated ASS1.
