Abstract
We examined whether a pretargeting method using a new
recombinant anti-CD20 bispecific antibody (bsMAb) followed
by 90Y-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N¶,N¶¶,N¶¶¶-tetraacetic
acid (90Y-DOTA)-peptide could reduce hematologic toxicity
yet improve therapeutic responses compared with conventional 90Y-anti-CD20 IgG and a chemically conjugated bsMAb.
TF4, a humanized, tri-Fab bsMAb with two Fabs binding
CD20 and one Fab binding histamine-succinyl-glycine (HSG),
developed by the dock and lock (DNL) method, was tested in
nude mice with Ramos B-cell lymphomas. Optimal pretargeting required a 29-h interval between TF4 and 90Y-DOTA-HSG,
and 20-fold more moles of TF4. TF4 cleared more rapidly from
the blood than anti-CD20 IgG, with early processing in the
liver, spleen, and kidney. At 24 h, TF4 improved tumor uptake
of 111In-HSG-peptide 2.6-fold [13% versus 5% injected dose per
gram (ID/g)] and enhanced tumor to blood ratios >45-fold
(770 versus 17), compared with an anti-CD20 Fab  anti-HSG
Fab chemical conjugate, and by 1.6-fold (9.0% versus 5.6%
ID/g) and 1,600-fold (522 versus 0.32), respectively, compared
with radiolabeled anti-CD20 IgG. A severe (z90%) and
prolonged reduction of WBCs was observed at the maximum
dose of 90Y-anti-CD20 IgG, whereas pretargeting resulted in a
V60% transient drop. TF4 pretargeting resulted in highly
significant improvement in survival, curing 33% to 90% of
the animals, even at relatively low doses, whereas most
tumors progressed quickly without cures with 90Y-anti-CD20
IgG. These results indicate an improved therapeutic index
with pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (RAIT) using a
DNL-constructed tri-Fab, bsMAb, compared with conventional
therapy with directly radiolabeled antibody or with a
chemically conjugated bsMAb. These encouraging results
prompt testing these constructs for pretargeting RAIT in
patients. [Cancer Res 2008;68(13):5282–90]

Introduction
Antibody-targeted therapies are important in the management
of hematologic malignancies, with the anti-CD20 IgG rituximab
having the greatest effect in non–Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL)
treatment but also in other hematologic tumors and even

nonmalignant conditions (1–6). Although rituximab has achieved
widespread acceptance, clinical studies have shown that radiolabeled anti-CD20 antibodies, 131I-tositumomab and 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan, have a higher objective response rate, yet these
treatments are prescribed infrequently (7–9). Several factors may
be responsible, including the pivotal trial findings that duration of
response and time to progression were not improved. Unlike
rituximab, anti-CD20 radioantibodies cause severe and protracted
hematologic toxicity in many patients. However, there are an
increasing number of reports showing a higher portion of durable
complete responses, with very promising results when used in
frontline and in consolidation settings (4, 10–21). Recent results
with radioimmunotherapy (RAIT) of NHL suggest that this
modality is gaining an increased role in the management of
patients with B-cell NHL (2).
Pretargeting methods separate the delivery of the antibody from
the radionuclide, which significantly reduces the residence time of
the radionuclide in the blood, the major cause of dose-limiting
hematologic toxicity (22, 23). Pretargeting systems show less
hematologic toxicity and improved efficacy in animal model
systems, including solid and hematologic tumors (24–33). We have
been pursuing a pretargeting approach based on a bispecific
antibody (bsMAb) for localization of a radiolabeled hapten-peptide
(34). Using a bsMAb prepared by chemically coupling a Fab¶
fragment of a humanized anti-CD20 antibody, veltuzumab
(Immunomedics, Inc.), and a Fab¶ of an anti-hapten antibody, we
showed improved efficacy by pretargeting a 90Y hapten-peptide
over that of the 90Y-anti-CD20 IgG (32). Recently, we reported a
novel method of producing fusion proteins, called the ‘‘dock and
lock’’ (DNL) procedure, which can be used to prepare recombinant,
humanized, bsMAbs composed of two Fabs against a tumor
antigen tethered to a Fab fragment of the antipeptide/hapten
antibody, as well as preparing several different multivalent
monospecific or bispecific antibodies (35, 36). Herein, we report
the development and testing of a DNL tri-Fab recombinant
construct for pretargeting CD20+ lymphomas and using the
histamine-succinyl-glycine (HSG) hapten capture that together
improve tumor uptake and the therapeutic index when compared
with a monovalently CD20-binding Fab¶  anti-hapten Fab¶
chemical conjugate or a directly radiolabeled anti-CD20 IgG,
suggesting that this method is promising for clinical evaluation.

Materials and Methods
DNL technology. The basis of the DNL method is the exploitation of the
specific protein-protein interactions occurring between the dimerization
and docking domain (DDD) in protein kinase A and the anchoring domain
(AD) in a reactive A-kinase anchoring protein (35, 36). With the DNL
method, two types of modules, one containing the DDD and the other the

complexes, which are then covalently linked via disulfide bonds by
incorporating cysteine residues into the natural sequences of DDD and

Antibody and peptide preparations. Using DNL, the preparation of the
h679-Fab-AD2-pdHL2 mammalian expression vector, the purification of the
h679-Fab-AD2 fusion protein, the preparation of DOTA-conjugated IMP-288
peptide [DOTA-D-Tyr-D-Lys(HSG)-D-Glu-D-Lys(HSG)-NH2; MH+, 1453], and
the humanized anti-CD20 IgG hA20 (veltuzumab) have been described
(35, 37, 38). Detailed descriptions of the preparation of the hA20-Fab-DDD2
DNL module and the subsequent assembly of TF4, as well as radiolabeling
procedures, are provided in the Supplementary Online Materials and
Methods.
Animal studies. All studies were performed after approval of the local
animal care and use committee. The Ramos human B-cell lymphoma line
was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in
roller bottle cultures to a concentration of 1  106 before harvesting for s.c.
implantation (1  107 cells) in 6- to 8-wk old female BALB/c nude mice
(AnNCr-nu/nu; NCI/CRL). Within 17 to 19 d, tumors became visible and
grew thereafter at a rapid rate. Most studies were initiated once the tumors
were f1 cm in diameter.
The dosing, tumor size, and number of animals for each study are
provided in the tables, figures, or in Results. All agents were administered
i.v. (V0.2 mL). Trace amounts of the radiolabeled antibodies were
supplemented with unconjugated antibody to meet the prescribed dose
(50 Ag for hA20 IgG, but for pretargeting, the bsMAb and IMP-288 doses
were adjusted to yield a desired molar ratio). For therapy studies, the
nmoles of IMP-288 were based on the radioactivity given, with the TF4 or
control TF2 protein dose adjusted to give a final molar ratio of 20:1.
The pretargeting capability of TF4, which binds divalently to CD20, was
compared with pretargeting with a hA20 Fab  m679 Fab chemical
conjugate that binds CD20 monovalently. Both constructs have monovalent
binding to HSG. Ramos-bearing nude mice were given 30 or 101 Ag
(0.3–1.0 nmol) of the chemical conjugate or 118 Ag (1.0 nmol) of TF4, and
48 or 29 h later, respectively, 0.03 to 0.05 nmol (f30 ACi) of the 111In-IMP-

288 was administered. At 24 and 48 h after the 111In-IMP-288 injection,
groups of five mice were necropsied.
Before necropsy, animals were anesthetized, bled by cardiac puncture,
and then euthanized. Tumors and tissues were weighed and then counted
in a gamma counter with appropriate 125I and 111In windows. The tissue
radioactivity was divided by its weight and then by the total injected activity
to derive the percent injected dose per gram tissue (% ID/g). Tumor to
tissue ratios were calculated from the respective % ID/g data. Area under
the curve (AUC) analysis was determined when multiple intervals were
examined. Biological (i.e., % ID/g) or effective (ACi/g) data were fit to a
single-rate exponential decay function. The exception was the effective AUC
data for the tumors in animals given the 90Y-hA20 IgG, which had an initial
uptake over the first 48 h (trapezoidal fit), followed by an exponential decay
thereafter. The slope of the terminal phase of the effective curve was used to
estimate activity remaining in the tumor to an infinite time. The Wilcoxon
two-sample test (one sided) was used to compare AUCs across treatment
groups as well as ratios of the AUC for the tumor and tissues.
Hematologic toxicity was assessed in nontumor-bearing, 8-wk-old,
female, NIH-Swiss mice. All animals were prebled 1 d in advance of the
treatment and then weekly thereafter. After local proparacaine anesthesia,
blood (f70 AL) was taken retro-orbitally and added to a RBC lysing buffer.
The cell pellet was washed and diluted in PBS-formalin for flow cytometry
analysis (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) using preset scatter windows to
discriminate mouse lymphocytes and granulocytes, as well as the complete
WBC count. The percent change in the WBCs of each animal from its
baseline determination was calculated and averaged (n = 5 per treatment).
Treatments consisted of an i.v. injection of 0.15 or 0.175 mCi of 90Y-hA20 IgG
or 0.25, 0.5, or 0.7 mCi of 90Y-IMP-288, pretargeted 29 h earlier with TF4
(20:1 molar ratio). These doses were selected based on prior experience
suggesting that animals would tolerate the highest planned activity (28, 32).
Six separate studies were performed to assess the therapeutic activity of
90
Y-hA20 IgG or TF4-pretargeted 90Y-IMP-288 at various dose levels and
with a variety of controls. Each study was controlled internally with an
untreated group of animals. Other controls included 90Y-IMP-288 alone, 90YIMP-288 pretargeted with the irrelevant TF2 anti–carcinoembryonic
antigen (CEA) bsMAb, and nonradiolabeled IMP-288 pretargeted with TF4
(i.e., TF4 and IMP-288 doses equivalent to 0.5 mCi 90Y-IMP-288 treatment).
The last control group was included because in vitro studies had indicated

that the divalent IMP-288 hapten-peptide could induce apoptosis in a
lymphoma cell line as a consequence of cross-linking TF4 on the cell surface
(39). All syringes were read for 90Y activity in a calibrated Capintec CRC-15R
dose calibrator. Groups of five animals were housed in filtered caging units.
Bedding was changed within 3 to 4 h after injection of 90Y-IMP-288 and then
again the next day to remove excreted activity. Whole-body clearance was
monitored by measuring the animals in a dose calibrator at 3, 24, and 48 h.
Readings also were made on a syringe containing each injected dose.
Tumors were measured two to three times a week using a caliper in three
perpendicular planes and expressed as cm3. Studies typically started when
the majority of the tumors were minimally 1.0 cm in the longest diameter.
Animals were removed from study (a) if tumor size exceeded 3.0 cm3, (b) if
their body weight decreased by >20% of their baseline weight, or (c) for
other health-related reasons. Survival analysis was based on the time
required for the tumor to reach a size of 3.0 cm3 (tumor progression).
Animals removed based on treatment- or nontreatment-related toxicity
were censored. Analysis was performed from Kaplan-Meier survival curves
using the log-rank test (Prism GraphPad version 4.0). Additionally, tumor
quadrupling times were calculated and analyzed using a Wilcoxon twosample comparison. For this analysis, the time required for tumors to reach
four times the initial cm3 size was determined from the growth curves. For
humane reasons, animals were not allowed to bear tumors >3.0 cm3, and
because several tumors exceeded 0.75 cm3 at the start of the study, in these
cases the quadrupling time was given as the time to reach 3.0 cm3. For
animals that had no visible tumor at the termination of the study, we
assigned the termination date at the worst case scenario quadrupling time.
Finally, animals that were removed from the study for reasons other than
tumor progression used the time of their removal as the quadrupling time.

Results
Characterization of TF4. Size-exclusion high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the IMP-291 affinitypurified fraction resolved a major peak (TF4), a lower molecular
weight species representing unreacted h679-Fab-AD2 (f5%), and
some high molecular weight multimer/aggregate (Supplementary
Fig. S1A). Size-exclusion HPLC analysis of Q-Sepharose–purified
TF4 (1.2 g or 83% yield) showed a single protein peak with a
retention time consistent with a 157-kDa protein (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). SDS-PAGE showed that the product consisted solely of
the constituent TF4 polypeptides (h679-Fd-AD2, hA20-Fd-DDD2,
and n light chains; Supplementary Fig. S1C). Bispecific binding
involving all three Fabs was shown by Biacore (Supplementary
Fig. S1D).
TF4 biodistribution in tumor-bearing nude mice. 125I-labeled
TF4 cleared rapidly from the blood of mice, decreasing to <1.0%
ID/g within 24 h (Table 1). At 1 h, the highest organ uptake was the

kidneys, but activity decreased rapidly until, at 24 h, there was
<0.5% remaining in any of the major organs. This distribution
is similar to that reported previously for TF2, an anti-CEA 
anti-HSG DNL bsMAb (35).
TF4 biodistribution was also assessed using 111In-labeled TF4.
111
In is sequestered in tissues, thereby providing a better estimate
of the total amount of protein delivered over time, whereas
radioiodine is released, providing a better estimate of the amount
of product that potentially is accessible (i.e., not internalized; ref.
40). At 3 h, tumor and tissue uptake with 111In-TF4 was distributed
in a proportional manner, similar to that of 125I-TF4 at 1 and 6 h,
with a high concentration in the blood and the highest uptake in
the kidneys, and similar amounts in the liver and spleen. However,
by 24 h, 111In-TF4 uptake in the tumor and normal tissues
increased, whereas 125I-TF4 decreased >10-fold. These data suggest
that TF4 is processed in the kidneys, liver, and spleen, but based on
tissue weights (e.g., f0.15, 1.1, and 0.1 g, respectively), most were
processed in the liver. The 111In-TF4 concentration in the blood at
24 h was surprisingly nine times higher than 125I-TF4. Sizeexclusion HPLC of serum from mice given 111In-TF4 showed no
evidence of dissociation or catabolic by-products at 1, 3, or 24 h
(data not shown). Because 111In-TF4 and 125I-TF4 had similar
immunoreactivity, the f5-fold higher levels of 111In-TF4 in the
tumor at 24 h compared with 125I-TF4 suggest that a sizable
portion of TF4 delivered to the tumor (approximately one fifth)
likely was processed.
Despite a molecular size similar to IgG, the concentration of
111
In-TF4 in the blood at 24 h was f2.8-fold lower than 111In-hA20
IgG (6.4 F 1.1% versus 17.6 F 1.5% ID/g, respectively; Table 1).
Tumor uptake for 111In-TF4 and hA20 IgG was similar at each
interval, but unlike 111In-TF4, 111In-hA20 IgG uptake in the three
major organs decreased at 24 h from measurements made at 2 h.
This suggests that IgG largely stays in the blood, whereas TF4 is
removed and processed by the major organs over the first 24 h.
This rapid blood removal affects maximum tumor accretion. For
example, tumor uptake for 111In-hA20 IgG increased to 10.4 F 2.3%
ID/g at 72 h, but 111In-TF4 levels decreased to 3.4 F 1.0% ID/g at
this time.
Optimizing TF4-pretargeted 111In-hapten-peptide. Prior
experience indicated that the radiolabeled hapten-peptide injection
should be delayed until the bsMAb blood concentration is <1.0%
ID/g (41). Initial studies examined increasing amounts of TF4
given at 29 or 39 h before the injection of a fixed amount of
111
In-IMP-288. Figure 2 shows the uptake of 111In-IMP-288 in the

Figure 2. Evaluation of optimal
pretargeting conditions. Tumor-bearing
nude mice (n = 5 per determination) were
administered increasing amounts of TF4
(0.125–1.0 nmol). At 29 or 39 h later,
0.025 nmol (15 ACi) of 111In-IMP-288 was
given. Doses are expressed as the TF4 to
IMP-288 molar ratio, ranging from 5:1 to
40:1. Columns, mean; bars, SD. Tumor
weights averaged 1.0 g for the animals

the animals examined at the 29-h interval.

tumor, blood, liver, and kidneys 3 h after the injection of IMP-288
under each of these conditions. At the 39-h interval, tumor uptake
increased as the bsMAb dose increased (i.e., increasing bsMAb to
IMP-288 molar ratios) to a maximum of 9.1 F 1.6% ID/g at a 20:1
ratio (80 Ag or 0.51 nmol TF4). Blood concentrations of IMP-288
also increased, but at the 20:1 ratio, there was only 0.05 F 0.03%
ID/g, resulting in tumor to blood ratios >200:1 at 3 h after injection.
When the interval was reduced to 29 h, a 20:1 TF4 to IMP-288
molar ratio again provided the highest tumor uptake (9.7 F 2.4%
ID/g), and whereas blood concentration increased to 0.34 F 0.29%
ID/g, tumor to blood ratios still averaged 30:1 at 3 h. Increasing
the bsMAb dose to 40:1 did not improve tumor uptake but
substantially increased blood concentrations (1.92 F 0.96% ID/g),
which reduced tumor to blood ratios to f5:1. Higher liver uptake
was associated with higher levels of peptide in the blood and could
reflect the clearance of bsMAb-hapten-peptide complexes. Kidney
uptake was less affected by changing pretargeting conditions,
although there was a trend toward slightly higher accretion at the
29-h interval compared with the 39-h interval and when a 40:1
molar ratio was used.
These data suggest that a 20:1 TF4 to IMP-288 molar ratio
provides the highest tumor uptake when used with a 29- or
39-h interval. Although delaying the injection of the radiolabeled
hapten-peptide for 39 h yields higher tumor to nontumor ratios,
previous experience suggested that the hapten-peptide should be
injected at the earliest opportunity to ensure optimal tumor
retention over time (41). An evaluation of tumor retention over
48 h in animals given 120 Ag of TF4 followed 29 h later with
decreasing amounts of 111In-IMP-288 to create TF4 to IMP-288
molar ratios of 5:1, 10:1, and 20:1 showed proportionally higher
tumor uptake as the TF4 to IMP-288 molar ratio increased (at 3 h,
3.9 F 0.5%, 6.9 F 1.7%, and 10.6 F 2.0% ID/g, respectively), but by

48 h, tumor uptake decreased 59%, 51%, and 45%, respectively
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Higher concentrations in the liver and
blood also occurred as the ratio increases, but kidney uptake was
relatively unaffected. Comparisons of the individual tissue AUC, as
well as AUC tumor to tissue ratios over 48 h, confirmed that a 20:1
molar ratio provided the highest tumor accretion and significantly
improved tumor to blood ratios (all P values V0.02), thereby
justifying the selection of a 20:1 ratio at the 29-h interval for the
best pretargeting results.
A comparison was made of 111In-IMP-288 targeting by the
recombinant TF4 bsMAb, which has two binding arms for CD20, to
the previously used hA20 Fab  m679 Fab chemical conjugate,
which binds monovalently to CD20. Each system required different
conditions for optimal pretargeting. For TF4, a 20:1 molar ratio and
a 29-h interval were used, whereas for the chemical conjugate the
optimal pretargeting conditions had previously been determined to
be 10:1 bsMAb to peptide ratio, with a 48-h interval (32). With TF4,
tumor uptake of 111In-IMP-288 at 24 h was 13.0 F 4.6% ID/g with
blood concentrations of only 0.02 F 0.01% ID/g, whereas with the
chemical conjugate tumor uptake was 5.1 F 0.9% ID/g with 0.32 F
0.14% ID/g in the blood. Increasing the protein dose of the
chemical conjugate to a 20:1 molar ratio with the 48-h interval
elevated tumor uptake to the same level as TF4 (13.1 F 0.5% ID/g)
but at the expense of higher activity in the blood (1.8 F 0.7% ID/g).
111
In-IMP-288 was also more stably bound in the tumor pretargeted
with TF4, with tumor uptake decreasing to 8.7 F 1.1% ID/g at
48 h (33% decrease) compared with a 50% decrease when
pretargeted with the chemical conjugate (2.6 F 0.5% ID/g at 48 h).
Biodistribution studies performed over 5 days were used
to assess the therapeutic prospects of 111In-hA20 IgG and the
TF4-pretargeted 111In-IMP-288, with Fig. 3 showing the data in
terms of the biological (% ID/g) and the effective uptake (ACi/g;

complete % ID/g and tumor/nontumor values given in Supplementary Table S1). Measurements of whole-body radioactivity
showed that 90% of the radiolabeled peptide cleared within 4 h,
whereas 90Y-hA20 IgG clearance mimicked the physical decay of
90
Y, with <5% of the total injected dose being removed from the
body at 48 h (Supplementary Fig. S3). For the hA20 IgG, tumor
uptake progressed gradually, reaching a peak by day 5 of 11.1 F
3.0 % ID/g, but blood clearance was slow, with tumor to blood
ratios remaining V1 until 5 days after injection. In contrast, tumor
uptake with the pretargeted 111In-IMP-288 achieved a maximum
level of 10.9 F 1.5% ID/g at 3 h and then decreased over time, with
a biological half-life of f48 h. In the pretargeted animals, the
concentration in the blood at 3 h was 55-fold less than the 90Y-IgG,
decreasing to >500-fold less at 24 h. The pretargeted 111In-IMP-288
levels in the kidneys and liver also were substantially lower than
the 111In-hA20 IgG, with a somewhat faster rate of clearance.
The effective clearance data shown in Fig. 3 assume a maximum
dose of 0.15 and 0.7 mCi for the 90Y-hA20 IgG and pretargeted
90
Y-IMP-288, respectively, based on toxicity data (see below). The
pretargeting method delivered 10 to 100 times more radioactivity
to the tumor in the first 24 h compared with directly radiolabeled
anti-CD20 IgG and continued to have higher levels in the tumor
over 72 h. AUC analysis of the effective curves for the tumors
showed a slight advantage for the 90Y-hA20 IgG over the
TF4-pretargeted 90Y-IMP-288 (3,932 versus 3,641 ACi/gh, respectively). Tumor to blood AUC ratios were 71:1 for the pretargeted
procedure compared with 1.6:1 for the anti-CD20 IgG. These data
indicate that pretargeting is at least as effective as directly
radiolabeled IgG but with much less hematologic toxicity.

Toxicity. Severe (z90%) reductions in WBCs occurred irrespective of the 90Y-hA20 IgG dose administered, with the nadir lasting
1 to 2 weeks and requiring 7 to 8 weeks for full recovery
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Lymphocytes and granulocytes experienced similar losses (data not shown). One animal given 0.15 mCi
of 90Y-hA20 IgG was removed at 2.9 weeks because of severe body
weight loss (>20%). Animals receiving the pretargeted 90Y-IMP-288
experienced a moderate (V60%) decrease in WBC and had a more
rapid recovery period, lasting no more than 4 weeks, depending on
the dose administered. No animals experienced severe body weight
loss. Previously, we defined the maximum tolerated dose for a
different pretargeted 90Y hapten-peptide in nude mice at 0.7 mCi,
with dose-limiting renal toxicity seen at 0.9 mCi (28), and therefore
elected not to escalate further.
Efficacy. Supplementary Figure S5 illustrates the growth curves
obtained in one of the studies (Study D; Table 2) from which
Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated (Fig. 4). The s.c.
Ramos tumors progressed rapidly in the untreated animals,
reaching z3.0 cm3 in f1 week (Table 2). Of the 55 untreated
tumors examined, 4 failed to progress to z3.0 cm3 (7.2%) in three
different studies. Three of them doubled in size before completely
regressing and one failed to grow from its starting size of 0.53 cm3.
Although the two control groups in Study F that received 0.5 mCi of
the 90Y-IMP-288 (alone or pretargeted with the irrelevant TF2 antiCEA bsMAb) had a statistically improved survival compared with
their untreated group [by Kaplan-Meier (Table 2) and Wilcoxon
analysis (Supplementary Table S2)], the overall survival was
increased by <1.0 week, and there were no cures. Unlabeled
IMP-288 pretargeted with TF4 did not improve survival compared

with the untreated group by Kaplan-Meier analysis (Study C). In
contrast, all TF4 pretargeting doses of 90Y-IMP-288 gave highly
significant survival extension but more importantly resulted in
cures for z4 months. Four of 10 animals given just 0.15 mCi of
TF4-pretargeted 90Y-IMP-288 were tumor-free 3 months after
treatment, but one of these animals was removed at 12.5 weeks
due to a nontreatment-related prolapsed rectum (Study B), leaving
3 of 9 (33%) cures at the end of the study. Doses of z0.25 mCi
90
Y-IMP-288 cured approximately 50% to 70% of the animals, with
median survivals longer than the duration of the studies (i.e., >17.5
weeks). The number of cures increased as the 90Y-IMP-288
increased, but it was also influenced by the median size of the
tumors at the onset of treatment. For example, in Study A, 8 of
11 animals (72.7%) were cured with a pretargeting dose of 0.25 mCi
90
Y-IMP-288 when the median tumor size was 0.24 cm3, but this
was reduced to 5 of 9 (55%) when the median tumor size was
0.51 cm3 (Study C). A similar effect was observed in animal given

www.aacrjournals.org

0.5 mCi of the TF4-pretargeted 90Y-IMP-288 when the tumors were
larger at the onset of treatment (Study C versus D). At 0.7 mCi, 90%
of the animals bearing tumors with a median size of 0.9 cm3 were
cured with 22.5 weeks of follow-up. In Study C, despite the
complete ablation of the 0.61-cm3 s.c. tumor of one animal within
1.7 weeks, the animal was removed at week 16 because of hind leg
paralysis and labored breathing that was subsequently confirmed
histologically to be disseminated lymphoma. We speculate that,
during implantation, tumor cells may have been injected below the
s.c. layer, allowing it to grow eventually in the body cavity. Given
the high-h energy and long path length of 90Y, the microscopic
deposits of tumor that might have been present in the body cavity
were not effectively controlled, whereas the established s.c. tumor
was killed.
Treatment with the 90Y-hA20 IgG was not as effective as the
pretargeted RAIT procedure. Most tumors responded initially to
the treatment, but many progressed quickly (Supplementary

Fig. S5). In addition, z20% loss in body weight occurred in several
animals, forcing their removal in <3 weeks. For example, in Study
D, two of the animals given 0.15 mCi of 90Y-hA20 IgG were
removed within 1 week because of >20% loss in body weight,
but their tumors were regressing at the time. Six animals given
0.175 mCi of 90Y-hA20 IgG had to be removed because of
excessive weight loss. Tumors had completely regressed in three
of these animals, another two were regressing, and one had
progressed after a short response. In contrast, none of the
animals given the pretargeted 90Y-IMP-288 was removed from the
study due to a treatment-related toxicity (i.e., their body weight
losses were V20%).

Discussion
Pretargeting approaches for radionuclide therapy reduce
hematologic toxicity by separating the radioisotope delivery from
the antibody-targeting step (23, 34). The radionuclide is
administered on a small molecule that escapes from the blood
quickly into the extravascular compartment, where it binds
rapidly to the pretargeted antibody, and then just as quickly is
cleared from the body. In the model presented, only 17.9 F 2.7%
of the injected activity remained in the mice 3 h after injection of
the radiolabeled peptide, whereas with the directly labeled antiCD20 IgG 47.3 F 4.5% was in the body after 3 days. This is similar
to clinical results with the 90Y-anti-CD20 IgG ibritumomab where
the vast amount of radioactivity remains in the body (8). The
rapid clearance permits higher levels of radioactivity to be given

with pretargeting, and the efficient capturing in the tumor
translates to radioactivity levels in the tumor for pretargeting to
often equal or higher levels than delivered by a directly
radiolabeled IgG (24, 34). Because most of the radioactivity is
removed by urinary excretion, renal toxicity is expected to be
dose limiting, which has been confirmed in animal and clinical
studies (28, 42). Kidney uptake in mice is only f2% ID/g 3 h after
injection and declines by f40% each day thereafter. This is
significantly lower than antibody fragments or small molecular
weight recombinant antibodies directly labeled with a radiometal
(43). Previously, we found 0.7 mCi to be the maximum tolerated
dose in mice (28) and therefore limited dose escalation in this
study to this level. However, we have observed 30% lower renal
uptake with 111In-IMP-288 than with 111In-IMP-241 that was used
in the earlier study, which might allow for additional escalation.
Although a reassessment of the maximum tolerated dose is being
made, at least in this model, the current dose levels provided
exceptional antitumor responses, resulting in cures in the
majority of the animals even at relatively low radiation amounts
given by pretargeting as single doses. Repeated dose cycles, as
may be desired in patients, may provide even better efficacy
results and need to be examined.
The effective AUC for tumor uptake measured over 5 days
suggested that the 90Y-hA20 IgG was somewhat higher than the
pretargeted 90Y-peptide at their respective maximum doses. This
estimate reflected an extrapolation over an infinite time. Because
IgG uptake in the tumor was slow, with essentially a flat slope at
the end of the 5-day monitoring period, the level of radioactivity in

the tumor over the remaining time was based mostly on the
physical decay of 90Y. However, the dose rate of the radiation
exposure at these later times would be much lower than that
delivered earlier. In this regard, the effective AUC over the first
5 days clearly favored the pretargeted 90Y-peptide, with uptake
being 10- to 100-fold higher than with IgG within the first 24 h. The
therapeutic results substantiated this finding, with the pretargeted
radiopeptide curing at least 40% of the animals at doses far less
than the maximum tolerated level, whereas 90Y-anti-CD20 IgG
was less effective and more toxic based on body weight loss and
WBC reduction. Thus, although the extrapolated AUCs for the
tumor with both procedures were similar, the more rapid and
higher amount of radioactivity delivered to the tumor clearly
translated into significantly improved antitumor responses for
pretargeting but without the severe hematologic toxicity observed
with the 90Y-IgG.
The superiority of this pretargeting procedure using a DNLprepared tri-Fab bsMAb against CD20 is appreciated by comparing
its tumor accretion and tumor to blood ratios with those of the
bivalent chemical conjugate and the directly labeled anti-CD20 IgG.
At 24 h, TF4 improved tumor uptake of 111In-HSG-peptide 2.6-fold
(13% versus 5% ID/g) and enhanced tumor to blood ratios >45-fold
(770 versus 17), compared with an anti-CD20 Fab  anti-HSG
Fab chemical conjugate, and by 1.6-fold (9.0% versus 5.6% ID/g)
and 1,600-fold (522 versus 0.32), respectively, compared with
radiolabeled anti-CD20 IgG. The 157-kDa TF4 clears very quickly
in mice for its size. With such rapid clearance, there is no need for a
clearing agent in mice. Because this construct lacks the Fc portion
of an immunoglobulin that is responsible for the longevity of IgG in
the blood (44), the pharmacokinetic behavior of this construct in
humans is uncertain.
The other pretargeting procedure based on streptavidin and
using anti-CD20 and antibodies against other targets associated
with lymphoma also has been used successfully in preclinical
models to improve therapeutic responses when compared with a
directly radiolabeled antibodies (29–31, 34, 35). The published
results from these methods compare favorably with those
reported herein. For example, maximum uptake in Ramos
xenografts reported for 111In-biotin using a chemical conjugate
of the 1F5 anti-CD20 IgG coupled to streptavidin was f13% ID/g,
holding relatively steady over 24 h (31). However, using the same
pretargeting system and tumor model, Subbiah and colleagues
reported tumor uptake f5% ID/g at 24 h (33). Tumor to blood
ratios were 3:1 to 5:1 for this conjugate at 24 h, whereas we have
optimized our system for the highest possible tumor to blood
ratios, achieving a tumor uptake of f10% ID/g with tumor to
blood ratios of 20:1 at 3 h and >500:1 at 24 h. Later studies with
an anti-CD20  streptavidin fusion protein showed similar uptake
in Ramos xenografts but with higher tumor to blood ratios
(f50:1) than reported for the chemical conjugate 24 h after the
labeled biotin was injected (45). Pilot clinical studies also were
performed with a streptavidin construct that indicated that some
patients developed an anti-streptavidin antibody response (46).
Only a single dose of 15 mCi/m2 of the 90Y-biotin was given under
varying conditions to assess targeting, and although two patients
experienced grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity, there were confounding factors involved (multiple chemotherapy regimens or bone
marrow involvement). Otherwise, no hematologic toxicity occurred in 11 of 14 patients. In contrast to the bsMAb pretargeting
method described herein, other approaches based on streptavidin
conjugates/constructs have required a clearing step to ensure

www.aacrjournals.org

adequate removal from the blood. Our bsMAb method simply
delays so that the primary targeting construct can clear
sufficiently from the blood, administering the radiolabeled
hapten-peptide later with less concern for the formation of
stable complexes of the radiolabeled product that would
otherwise form with biotin/streptavidin. Indeed, the basis for
the affinity enhancement system used by this pretargeting
procedure is that the binding of the radiolabeled divalent hapten
to the bsMAb in the tumor is far stronger than to the bsMAb in
the blood (47). However, the primary incentive for using a bsMAb
pretargeting approach over one that uses streptavidin is because
streptavidin has been proven to be quite immunogenic, whereas
exclusive use of humanized bsMAbs should significantly reduce
immunogenicity.
We reported previously improved antitumor responses using a
monovalent anti-CD20 Fab  anti-HSG Fab chemical conjugate,
and here we show with the novel DNL recombinant construct
that binding divalently to CD20 improves tumor accretion and
retention. The DNL procedure can be used to make several
different bispecific constructs that can have as many as four
binding sites for the tumor target antigen and two binding sites
for a hapten and also has distinct advantages of facile production,
high protein yields, simple purification, and flexibility (36). The
higher molecular weight of these constructs might extend blood
clearance times, or their size might impede migration into the
tumor, but this was not found in these studies, where the TF4
cleared faster than IgG and the radiation delivered to tumor was
at least as high as directly labeled IgG. Indeed, this rapid
clearance from blood while retaining binding to tumor (f11%
ID/g) resulted in tumor to blood ratios of >200:1 at 3 h after
radiopeptide injection when optimal conditions were used. At
24 h, TF4 pretargeting resulted in 2.6-fold improved tumor
accretion, and 30-fold less blood radioactivity, than achieved with
the bivalent chemical conjugate. Thus, we believe that the current
divalent  monovalent tri-Fab construct used in combination
with a divalent hapten is advantageously suited for clinical
development.
Several studies have indicated that cells bound with an antiCD20 IgG can be killed by apoptosis, particularly when the
antibody is cross-linked with a secondary antibody or other crosslinking agents (48, 49). In these studies, however, mice treated with
a single dose of TF4 followed by unlabeled IMP-288 had progressive
growth similar to the untreated animals, indicating that the
delivery of radiation to the tumor was the primary mechanism
responsible for the responses seen.
We appreciate that pretargeting is more complex than
conventional one-step RAIT and thus may experience even more
resistance than the current practice of RAIT in NHL therapy.
However, if higher radiation doses can be delivered to tumors
selectively, with truly superior tumor to nontumor ratios, resulting
in lower myelosuppression and other organ toxicities, then it may
offer truly substantive therapeutic advantages over current RAIT,
including the prospect of attaching radionuclides with other
energies of possible interest.
In conclusion, a novel recombinant bsMAb construct divalently
binding to CD20 and having specificity for a unique hapten, HSG,
has shown improved binding over a monovalent bsMAb chemical
conjugate, with the ability to significantly improve antitumor
response with a >40% cure rate compared the directly radiolabeled
anti-CD20 IgG, which was not curative. Reducing the risk of
hematologic toxicity might allow pretargeting approaches to be

Thus, the improved therapeutic index of this procedure warrants
clinical assessment.
