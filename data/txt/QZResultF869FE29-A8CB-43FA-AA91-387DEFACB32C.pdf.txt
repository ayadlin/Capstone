Abstract
Epidemiologic studies associate low serum vitamin D levels with an increased risk of colon cancer and
inﬂammatory diseases such as inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD). 129-Smad3tm1Par/J (Smad3/) mice are a
model of bacteria-driven colitis and colon cancer when infected with Helicobacter bilis (H. bilis). Thus, we used
this mouse model to determine whether increased dietary vitamin D would reduce inﬂammation and colon
cancer. Smad3/ mice were fed puriﬁed diet with either maintenance (1 IU vitamin D/g diet; maintenance) or
increased concentrations of vitamin D (5 IU vitamin D/g diet; high vitamin D). One week after diet initiation,
mice were inoculated with broth or H. bilis and were necropsied at several time points postinoculation to assess
inﬂammation, dysplasia, and neoplasia incidence. At 16 weeks postinfection, 11% of mice fed high vitamin D
diet had cancer compared with 41% of mice fed maintenance diet (P ¼ 0.0121). Evaluation at an early time
point (1 week postinfection) showed that animals fed high vitamin D had decreased MAPK (p-P38 and p-JNK)
activation in lamina propria leukocytes as well as decreased NFkB activation in colonic epithelial cells.
Reduction in MAPK and NFkB activation correlated with decreased IBD scores (2.7 vs. 15.5; P < 0.0001) as well
as decreased inﬂammatory cell inﬁltrates and reduced expression of proinﬂammatory cytokines in cecal tissue.
These ﬁndings suggest that increased dietary vitamin D is beneﬁcial in preventing inﬂammation-associated
colon cancer through suppression of inﬂammatory responses during initiation of neoplasia or early-stage
carcinogenesis. Cancer Res; 74(16); 4398–408. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed
cancer in both men and women (1). Studies indicate that diet
and lifestyle choices play a signiﬁcant role in the development
of and prognosis of colon cancer (2). Vitamin D status of an
individual is also inﬂuenced by both diet and lifestyle (3). The
link between vitamin D and colon cancer was ﬁrst suggested by
Garland and colleagues who observed that populations residing in the northeastern United States had an increased incidence of colon cancer–related mortality compared with those
living in the southern United States (4). Since then, adequate
serum vitamin D levels have been associated with decreased
incidence of colon cancer and decreased mortality in patients
diagnosed with colon cancer (5, 6). Adequate serum vitamin D
levels also correlate with reduced risk for developing inﬂam1

matory diseases, such as Crohn's disease, a risk factor for colon
cancer (3, 7).
The risk of colon cancer is increased in patients diagnosed
with IBD (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) compared with
the general population, supporting the notion that colonic
inﬂammation affects cancer development (8). The chronic
inﬂammation seen in IBD, likely due in part to dysregulated
mucosal immune responses to enteric antigens (8), is believed
to progress to cancer through the promotion of angiogenesis,
tumor-promoting cytokine production, tumor cell–invasive
behavior and cellular proliferation (9).
Vitamin D has a protective effect against colon cancer in
various mouse models (10, 11). However, these cancer models,
such as ApcMin/þ mice or mice given a chemical mutagen such
as azoxymethane (AOM), are not driven by inﬂammation (12–
15). Currently, the protective effect of vitamin D on inﬂammation-associated colon cancer is not known.
To investigate the potential chemopreventive effects of elevated dietary vitamin D on inﬂammation-associated colon
cancer, we utilized Smad3/ (Smad3tm1Par/J) mice, which have
defective TGFb signaling due to the absence of the transcription
factor Smad3 (16). In humans, the TGFb signaling pathway is
commonly mutated in colon cancer, including colitis-associated colorectal cancer (17). After being infected with an enteric
microorganism, Helicobacter bilis (16), Smad3/ mice develop
transient colitis followed months later by colon cancer making
them a useful model for studying inﬂammation-associated
colon cancer. Using this model, we demonstrate that elevated

Vitamin D Decreases MAPK Signaling, Colitis, and Cancer

dietary vitamin D increases serum vitamin D and protects
H. bilis (Hb)-infected Smad3/ mice from developing colon
cancer. These protective effects are mediated through the
interactions between vitamin D and proinﬂammatory signaling
pathways during the early stages of disease development.

Materials and Methods
Mice and diets
Study mice were colony-bred 129-Smad3tm1Par/J (Smad3/)
mice (age 6–14 weeks) housed in a speciﬁc pathogen-free
facility. Mice were screened for rodent pathogens as previously
described (18) except that sentinels were collected three times
yearly rather than quarterly. In addition to referenced pathogens, annual screens were performed for minute virus of mice,
lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and ectromelia virus.
Mice were maintained in a Helicobacter and Mouse Norovirus-free colony as previously described (19). The mice were
group housed in ventilated cages and fed a puriﬁed, irradiated
diet with 1 IU vitamin D (5SRH, maintenance), 5 IU vitamin D
(5AAA, high vitamin D), or 0 IU vitamin D per gram (5AV4,
AIN93Null). All diets were manufactured by PMI Nutrition
International (LabDiet/TestDiet) based on AIN93M diet that is
formulated for the maintenance of rodents' health. All animal
procedures were approved by the University of Washington
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Experimental design
While no age-associated alterations in endpoint disease
have been noted in our experience with Smad3/ mice, care
was taken to evenly distribute mice across treatment groups
with regard to age and sex. Independent studies were performed to evaluate the effects of high and low dietary vitamin D
levels on cancer. For high vitamin D studies, mice were started
on either maintenance or high vitamin D diets one week before
infection. For vitamin D–deﬁcient studies, maintenance or
AIN93Null diets were initiated two weeks before infection
(Supplementary Fig. S1). For each diet, mice were infected
with either approximately 2  107 CFU Hb in Brucella broth or
Brucella broth alone (controls) by oral gavage as previously
described (Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 16). Helicobacter infection status was monitored by fecal PCR using previously
published primer sequences (18). Fecal samples were collected
at 3, 6, and 14 days postinfection for subjective fecal scoring
and at 7 days postinfection for fecal cytokine analysis. Mice
were weighed weekly and monitored at least three times
weekly for dehydration, diarrhea, lethargy, or weight loss.
Animals were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation at the designated end points.
Serum vitamin D and calcium determination and tissue
collection
Following euthanasia, blood was obtained via cardiac puncture. Serum samples were submitted to Heartland Assays for
quantiﬁcation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (radioimmunoassay)
and calcium levels. Mesenteric lymph nodes, cecum, colon,
and rectum were ﬁxed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin
and processed for routine histologic examination. For study of

the early inﬂammatory phase, cross-sections of proximal colon
(5 mm) were prepared for immunohistochemistry (IHC) and
histology, and cross-sections of proximal colon (5 mm) and
cecum (3 mm) were stored in RNA later (Qiagen) for cytokine
analysis by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT)-PCR. For evaluation of Hb colonization, 3 cm sections of mid-jejunum,
proximal colon, distal colon, and whole cecum were harvested,
rinsed gently in sterile PBS to remove fecal material, and stored
at 20 C until DNA extraction. For fecal cytokine analysis,
individual fecal samples were collected, homogenized in 250
mL RNAlater stabilization solution (Qiagen), and stored
at 80 C until RNA extraction. At the time of collection, a
subjective fecal score was assigned to each animal, ranking
presence of diarrhea and blood in the stool as a clinical
measure of IBD (20).
Histopathology and immunohistochemistry
Whole colon and cecum were evaluated by a board-certiﬁed
veterinary pathologist (P.M. Treuting) blinded to experimental
groups to assess the severity of colitis and incidence of neoplasia. An overall IBD score was determined as described (21)
with the exceptions that scores were summed from cecum,
proximal, mid, and distal colons and none were weighted.
Analysis of the rectum was included with the distal colon. IBD
scores incorporate the severity of mucosal epithelial changes,
degree of inﬂammation, and extent of lesions. A dysplasia score
was also generated by determining the degree of dysplasia
present in each of four segments as described (22): cecum,
proximal colon, mid colon, and distal colon. For each segment,
a score ranging from 0–4 was assigned: 0, none; 1, indeﬁnite; 2,
low grade; 3, high grade; and 4, high grade with frank invasion
beyond tunica muscularis and distinguished from mucosal
herniation. Cancers were classiﬁed as adenocarcinomas and
mucinous adenocarcinomas (16, 22). The four individual segmental scores were summed to generate the overall dysplasia
score for each animal.
For study of the early inﬂammatory phase, colonic expression of CD3, F4/80, cleaved caspase-3, and MHCII were evaluated on transverse cross-sections of proximal colon in animals euthanized 1 week postinfection. IHC staining within the
mucosa, excluding any gastrointestinal lymphoid tissue, was
scored by a pathologist blinded to groups (P.M. Treuting),
using a range of 0–4: 0, no positive cells; 1, few single positive
cells; 2, few (3 or less) scattered small clusters of positive cells; 3,
many (>3) small clusters of positive cells or larger clusters of
positive cells; and 4, large or coalescing clusters of positive
cells. For early time points, in addition to IHC staining, cecum
and serial transverse cross-sections of proximal colon were
evaluated histologically for evidence of IBD.
All IHC staining was performed by Experimental Histopathology Services at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center
(Seattle, WA). Rat monoclonal antibodies were used to detect
MHC class II (I-A/I-E, BD Pharmingen), CD3 (MCA1477, Serotec), and F4/80 (MCA497, Serotec). Signals were detected
using biotinylated goat anti-rat (Jackson ImmunoResearch)
followed by streptavidin HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch).
Cleaved caspase-3 antibody (Biocare Medical CP229B) was
followed by Mach 2 anti-rabbit HRP-labeled polymer (Biocare

Medical RHRP520L). Staining was visualized with 3,30 -diaminobenzidine (Dako) and counterstained with hematoxylin
(Dako). Concentration-matched isotype control slides were
run for each tissue sample (Jackson ImmunoResearch).
Cytokine analysis and Helicobacter quantiﬁcation by
quantitative real-time PCR analysis
For cytokine analysis, RNA was extracted from cecum, colon,
and feces using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). Fecal RNA samples
were further concentrated using the Qiagen mini-elution/cleanup kit. RNA was converted to cDNA using SuperScript First
Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) followed by qRT-PCR
using Power Sybr Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and
a Stratagene Mx3005P analyzer (Agilent Technologies). Samples
were run in duplicate. Cytokine levels were normalized to
hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) and
expressed relative to a control sample (RNA from cecum or
proximal colon) that was run on every plate as a calibrator. For
Helicobacter quantiﬁcation, DNA was extracted from mid-jejunal, cecal, proximal colon, and distal colon samples using a
previously published protocol (23). Primer sequences used are
outlined in Supplementary Table S1. Data were analyzed using
Stratagene's MxPro v4.10 software (Agilent Technologies).
Epithelial and lamina propria cell preparations
Proximal colon (4 cm sections) samples were rinsed in PBS
to remove fecal material, and epithelial and lamina propria
leukocyte (LPL) populations were isolated using the Lamina
Propria Dissociation Kit and gentleMACS Dissociator according to manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were
pelleted, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80 C.
Western blotting
Protein was extracted by homogenizing cell pellets in RIPA
buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) containing protease and
phosphatase inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). Western
blot analysis was performed according to a previously published protocol (19) with the following modiﬁcations. Proteins
(40 mg/lane) were run on gradient (4%–15%) Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to polyvinylidene
ﬂuoride membranes using 100 mmol/L N-cyclohexyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid buffer with 10% methanol. Primary antibodies used were vitamin D receptor (VDR, SC-1008; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), NFkB signaling (Phospho-NF-kB p65
(Ser536), and IkBa, L35A5; Cell Signaling Technology), MAPK
signaling (Phospho-MAPK Family, 9910, and MAPK Family,
9926, Antibody sampler kits; Cell Signaling Technology), Bcl-xl
(54H6; Cell Signaling Technology), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA, PC10; Cell Signaling Technology). b-Actin
(A5441; Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a loading control.
Statistical analysis
Before statistical analysis, distribution of data was assessed
for normality. If data were not normally distributed, transformation was attempted; if transformation did not normalize the
distribution, nonparametric tests were performed. Serum vitamin D, serum calcium, histologic scoring, fecal scoring, and
densitometries were analyzed using either an unpaired or

Mann–Whitney t test. qRT-PCR data were analyzed using the
Kruskal–Wallis nonparametric test followed by the Dunn post
hoc test to adjust for multiple comparisons. Cancer and
dysplasia incidence signiﬁcance was determined by the Fisher
exact test. All data are presented as mean  SEM. Differences
with a P value of 0.05 or less were considered signiﬁcant. All
statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism
software (Version 5.04, GraphPad Software Inc).

Results
Increased dietary vitamin D signiﬁcantly increases
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D without altering serum
calcium levels
To determine whether high dietary vitamin D increases serum
vitamin D status without causing toxicity in Smad3/ mice, we
measured serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and serum calcium in
mice fed high vitamin D diet or maintenance diet (control) for
one week. The high vitamin D diet signiﬁcantly increased serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D levels without altering serum calcium (25hydroxyvitamin D mean: 37.6 vs. 17.6 ng/mL, P ¼ 0.016; calcium
mean: 9.6 vs. 10.6 mg/dL, P ¼ 0.1), demonstrating that the dietary
regimen rapidly elevated serum vitamin D levels without causing hypercalcemia. Similarly, after 16 weeks on diet, Smad3/
mice fed high vitamin D diet had serum vitamin D levels that
were roughly double that of mice fed maintenance diet (mean:
38.4 vs. 14.4 ng/mL, P < 0.0001; Fig. 1A) while serum calcium
levels remained unchanged (Fig. 1B).
Treatment with increased dietary vitamin D signiﬁcantly
reduces cancer incidence in Hb-infected Smad3/ mice
Hb-infected mice fed increased dietary vitamin D had a
signiﬁcantly reduced incidence of invasive colon cancer compared with Hb-infected mice fed maintenance diet (11% vs. 41%,
P ¼ 0.0121; Fig. 1C). No neoplastic lesions developed in uninfected mice on either diet (Fig. 1C). Mucinous adenocarcinomas
located in the proximal colon were the primary neoplasm
diagnosed, as previously noted in this model (Fig. 1D; ref. 16).
Well-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinomas were characterized by expansile mucin-ﬁlled, epithelial-lined cysts that
disrupt the muscular tunics, serosa and expand into mesentery
(Fig. 1D). Consistent with the decreased incidence of invasive
adenocarcinoma, Hb-infected mice fed high vitamin D diet
had an average 4-fold decrease in dysplasia scores compared
with mice fed maintenance diet (mean: 0.71 vs. 2.85, P < 0.001;
score range 0–16; Fig. 1E) with a signiﬁcantly higher percentage
of animals with no evidence of dysplasia (83% vs. 40%, P ¼
0.0005). Dysplasia was primarily observed in the cecum
and proximal colon. Minimal dysplasia was observed in the
mid colon of mice fed maintenance diet but not in high vitamin
D fed mice. No dysplasia was observed in the distal colon
regardless of diet.
Clinical disease and colonic inﬂammatory cell inﬁltrates
are reduced during the inﬂammatory phase in Hbinfected Smad3/ mice fed increased dietary vitamin D

condition. Clinical signs typically resolve within 7 to 14 days
until the time that cancers develop (unpublished observations;
ref. 16). To determine the effects of elevated dietary vitamin D
on early disease stages, we assessed clinical disease parameters
and alterations in inﬂammatory inﬁltrates in the colons of Hbinfected mice fed high vitamin D diet compared with Hbinfected mice fed maintenance diet. During the initial inﬂammatory period, mice were assigned a subjective fecal score to
assess clinical evidence of IBD. Animals fed high vitamin D diet
had signiﬁcantly decreased fecal scores at both 3 and 6 days
postinfection (mean 0.1 vs. 0.8, P ¼ 0.0015 and 0.2 vs. 1.0 P ¼
0.0003, respectively; Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B) compared with animals fed maintenance diet. Broth-treated animals showed no evidence of diarrhea, as expected, and by 14
days postinfection all animals had minimal evidence of diarrhea regardless of diet (Supplementary Fig. S2C). There was no
signiﬁcant difference in body weight change associated with
diet following Hb infection (data not shown).

colonic inﬂammation during early disease, proximal colon, and
cecum of mice fed high vitamin D or maintenance diet were
analyzed for inﬂammation one week after Hb infection. Hbinfected animals fed high vitamin D diet had signiﬁcantly
reduced colitis compared with infected animals fed maintenance diet (mean 2.7 vs. 15.5, P < 0.0001; Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S3A). Immunohistochemical studies further demonstrated that infected mice fed high vitamin D diet had decreased
inﬂammatory inﬁltrates compared with those fed maintenance
diet [F4/80þ cells (mean  SEM: 2.7  0.19 vs. 3.7  0.11, P ¼
0.0003), CD3þ T cells (mean  SEM: 2.1  0.15 vs. 2.6  0.17, P ¼

Because inﬂammation is often associated with increased cell
proliferation, we evaluated if increased dietary vitamin D was
associated with changes in cell proliferation in either lamina
propria or epithelial cell populations within the colon one week
after Hb treatment. PCNA was used as a marker of cellular
proliferation by Western blot analysis. Analysis of PCNA

captured at the same low (4; scale bars, 500 mm) and high (10; scale bars, 200 mm; all bottom rows have the same magniﬁcation) magniﬁcations. Brothtreated controls fed maintenance diet are shown. No signiﬁcant differences were noted between maintenance and high vitamin D diet groups treated with

showed no signiﬁcant differences associated with diet in either
cell population (LPL mean 0.73 vs. 0.67, epithelial cell mean 0.99
vs. 0.85, high vitamin D diet vs. maintenance diet respectively,
data not shown).
High dietary vitamin D decreases cecal, proximal colon,
and fecal proinﬂammatory cytokines 1 week after Hb
infection
Because we previously observed elevated inﬂammatory
cytokines in this model associated with Hb infection (16),
proinﬂammatory cytokine expression in cecal and proximal
colon tissues one week after Hb infection were evaluated to
determine whether increased vitamin D would dampen the
inﬂammatory response induced by infection. Increased expression of Il1b, macrophage chemotaxis factor 1a (Mip1a), Il6,
Tnfa, and Ifng were noted in cecal tissue from Hb-infected
animals fed maintenance diet compared with broth-treated
controls (Fig. 3) as seen previously with this model (16).
However, there was a signiﬁcant reduction in expression of
those same cytokines in Hb-infected mice fed increased dietary
vitamin D compared with those fed maintenance diet (Fig. 3A–
E). Interestingly, there were no changes in expression of the
anti-inﬂammatory cytokine, Il10 in response to diet or Hb
infection (Fig. 3F). Expression patterns of proinﬂammatory
cytokines in the proximal colon were similar to those observed
in cecal tissue (Supplementary Fig. S4A–S4F).
Fecal cytokines have been used in the Hb-infected

response and predict development of cancers (24). To determine whether fecal cytokine expression correlated with
tissue cytokine expression, expression of Il1b and Mip1a
was evaluated in fecal pellets collected from animals 1, 2,
and 3 weeks after Hb infection. Similar to the expression
pattern of Il1b and Mip1a observed in cecal and proximal
colon tissues at 1 week after infection (Fig. 3A and B and
Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B), expression of Il1b and
Mip1a in feces were signiﬁcantly increased in Hb-infected
animals fed maintenance diet compared with broth-treated
animals (Supplementary Fig. S4G and S4H). Accordingly, Hbinfected mice fed high vitamin D diet had an average 3-fold
decrease in fecal Il1b and 1.5-fold decrease in fecal Mip1a
expression compared with mice fed the maintenance diet.
However, these fecal cytokine changes were transient as
there were no signiﬁcant differences in Il1b and Mip1a
expression between any treatment group at 2 or 3 weeks
after infection (data not shown).
Increased dietary vitamin D decreases p-P38 MAPK in the
colon
Helicobacter species have been shown to elicit proinﬂammatory cytokine production through TLR4-dependent activation of the MAPK and NFkB pathways (25). Thus, we determined whether decreased colonic inﬂammation in Smad3/
mice in response to increased dietary vitamin D was associated
with altered MAPK and NFkB signaling pathways during early
disease (1 week after Hb infection).

For changes in the MAPK pathway, relative levels of protein
expression of activated forms of P38 (p-P38), JNK (p-JNK), and
ERK1/2 (p-ERK) in LPL and colonic epithelial cell populations
were determined. LPLs of Hb-infected animals fed increased
dietary vitamin D had a 7-fold decrease in p-P38 compared
with maintenance diet-fed animals (P ¼ 0.012, Fig. 4A and
Supplementary Fig. S5). Interestingly, similar changes were not
detected in colonic epithelial cells (Fig. 4A and Supplementary
Fig. S5). There was a trend toward decreased p-JNK expression
in colonic tissue from animals fed increased dietary vitamin D;
however, these differences were not statistically signiﬁcant

High dietary vitamin D does not alter Hb colonization in
Smad3/ mice
Changes in the gut microbiome or changes in bacterial load
can inﬂuence disease severity in both human patients (26) and
animal models of IBD (26, 27). As Tlr4 expression levels tend to
be lower in high vitamin D-fed Smad3/ mice following Hb
infection, we determined whether vitamin D alters Hb colonization in cecum and colon where they preferentially reside
(16). qRT-PCR was used to compare the relative amount of
Helicobacter organisms in cecal, proximal, and distal colonic
tissues collected 8 weeks after Hb infection from mice fed
either increased or maintenance levels of vitamin D. While

difference was not statistically signiﬁcant.

cecal tissues had the highest concentration of Helicobacter as
previously reported (16), no signiﬁcant differences in Helicobacter colonization were associated with diet (Supplementary
Fig. S6).
High dietary vitamin D does not alter cecal expression of
vitamin D receptor or enzymes involved in vitamin D
metabolism
To determine whether the protective effect of increased
dietary vitamin D was associated with changes in proteins
involved in vitamin D signaling and/or metabolism, qRT-PCR
was used to evaluate RNA expression of vitamin D receptor
(Vdr) as well as two enzymes involved in conversion of vitamin
D into its active and inactive forms, 25(OH)D3-1a-hydroxylase
(Cyp27b1), and 1, 25(OH)2D3 24 hydroxylase (Cyp24a1) in cecal
tissue at one week after Hb infection. A small yet signiﬁcant
increase in VDR expression was detected in mice fed high
vitamin D diet following Hb infection (Fig. 5A). However, there
were no changes in mRNA levels of Cyp27b1 and Cyp24a1
associated with either diet or infection status (Fig. 5B and C).
Although Vdr mRNA was altered with diet, differences in VDR
protein expression were not detected using Western blot
analysis of proximal colon tissue (data not shown).

A vitamin D–deﬁcient diet did not exacerbate colitis or
colitis-associated colon cancer in Hb-infected Smad3/
mice
Because decreased serum vitamin D is associated with an
increased risk for developing IBD as well as colon cancer in
humans (4–7), we hypothesized that a diet deﬁcient in vitamin
D would exacerbate inﬂammation and potentially increase the
incidence of colon tumors in Hb-infected Smad3/ mice. We
tested this hypothesis by feeding mice maintenance diet or diet
devoid of vitamin D (AIN93Null) and induced inﬂammation by
Hb infection. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were signiﬁcantly decreased in AIN93Null-fed mice compared with mice
fed maintenance diet (mean: 5.7 vs. 12.2 ng/mL, P ¼ 0.01) after 2
weeks on the diet and were below the limit of detection at the
end of the 16-week study (Fig. 6A and B). Despite decreased
serum vitamin D levels, mice maintained on AIN93Null diet
showed no differences in serum calcium compared with maintenance diet–fed controls (Fig. 6C). Clinical disease during the
early inﬂammatory phase was assessed by monitoring subjective fecal scores and body weight change following Hb infection. Mice maintained on AIN93Null diet showed no differences in fecal scores or body weight change compared with
maintenance diet–fed controls (data not shown). To determine
whether decreased dietary vitamin D exacerbated IBD at early
disease stages, proximal colon and cecal tissue of mice fed
maintenance diet or AIN93Null were analyzed for inﬂammation one-week after Hb infection. There were no differences in
IBD associated with diet (Fig. 6D). To further evaluate any
effect of AIN93Null diet, proinﬂammatory cytokine expression
in proximal colon tissues was measured to determine whether
decreased dietary vitamin D would exacerbate the inﬂammatory response induced by Hb. In correlation with the lack of
effect on IBD scores, no differences were noted in cytokine gene
expression associated with diet (Supplementary Fig. S7). Consistent with the lack of altered inﬂammation early in disease,
there were no differences in cancer incidence or dysplasia
noted between AIN93Null-fed mice compared with mainte-

nance diet–fed animals (Fig. 6E and F) when necropsied after
16 weeks of Hb infection.

Discussion
Using Smad3/ mice, we have shown that increased
dietary vitamin D affords protection against the development
of colon cancer. In this model, we have demonstrated that
increased dietary vitamin D (i) induces elevated serum 25hydroxyvitamin D without causing hypercalcemia, (ii) significantly decreases inﬂammation, dysplasia, and tumor incidence following infection with Hb, and (iii) is associated with
decreased p-P38 (MAPK) and p-P65 (NFkB) expression during the acute inﬂammatory stage of disease. These studies
provide evidence that the protective effect(s) of elevated
dietary vitamin D supplementation in a model of inﬂammation-associated colon cancer are mediated through suppression of the inﬂammatory responses triggered following infection with colitogenic bacteria.
Animals fed increased concentrations of dietary vitamin D
demonstrated signiﬁcant protection against inﬂammation and
tumor formation. It should be noted that though serum
vitamin D levels are increased in mice fed high vitamin D diet
compared with those fed maintenance diet, levels remain
within the comparable recommended range for humans without reaching superphysiologic levels (28). Many animal and
human studies that have shown antitumor effects of vitamin D
administer metabolically active 1,25(OH)2D3, which results in
hypercalcemia and vitamin D toxicities (10, 12, 15). Our studies
show that dietary vitamin D supplementation offers a way to
improve vitamin D status and provide protection from inﬂammation-associated colon cancer while avoiding vitamin D
toxicity.
Vitamin D supplementation decreases cancer incidence in
several rodent models of colon cancer (12–15). These models
rely on either genetic predisposition for the development of
gastrointestinal neoplasias as is the case with APCMin/þ mice or

treatment with a chemical mutagen such as AOM to simulate
the adenoma to carcinoma progression that occurs during the
development of sporadic colon cancer (8, 29). However, the
molecular changes, disease progression, and pathology of
inﬂammation-associated cancer are distinct from those
changes observed in sporadic or familial colon cancers and
therefore may inﬂuence the efﬁcacy of vitamin D as well as
mechanisms through which it promotes protection from
tumor formation.
Chronic inﬂammation is believed to frequently play a key
role in carcinogenesis (9). Links between inﬂammation and
cancer have not only been observed in colon cancer in human
patients with IBD (8) but also in liver, pancreatic, stomach,
esophageal, and prostate cancers (9). Several studies utilizing
mouse models of colitis have shown that vitamin D can be
beneﬁcial in preventing or ameliorating inﬂammation and
clinical disease (30–32); however, these models do not typically
progress to neoplasia. Recently, the DSS/AOM model, another
model of inﬂammation-associated cancer that does progress
to dysplasia and tumor formation, was used to demonstrate
that increasing concentrations of dietary vitamin D are protective against preneoplasic lesions in a dose-dependent manner (33). Consistent with these ﬁndings, we have shown that

4406

Cancer Res; 74(16) August 15, 2014

increased dietary vitamin D is effective at not only preventing
inﬂammation and dysplasia, but subsequent invasive tumor
formation as well.
Chronic inﬂammation is associated with increased production of proinﬂammatory cytokines, including TNFa,
IL1b, and IL6, which contribute to carcinogenesis through
inﬂuences on cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation,
and angiogenesis (34). Dietary vitamin D supplementation
signiﬁcantly lowered inﬂammatory cytokines induced in
response to Hb in Smad3/ mice. In human patients with
colon cancer, these proinﬂammatory cytokines are positively
associated with increased cancer growth, higher neoplastic
grade, and increased risk of mortality (34). Proinﬂammatory
cytokines are also upregulated in patients with IBD, even
before the onset and progression to dysplasia or neoplasia
(35), and vitamin D supplementation has been linked to
decreased circulating proinﬂammatory cytokines in patients
with colorectal adenomas (36). Epidemiologic evidence suggests that treatments that limit inﬂammation may be beneﬁcial in reducing the incidence of inﬂammation-associated
colon cancer in high risk populations (37). Together, these
data suggest that dietary vitamin D may be effective
at decreasing the proinﬂammatory milieu in patients with

Vitamin D Decreases MAPK Signaling, Colitis, and Cancer

IBD and serve as a useful adjunct treatment in certain
populations.
The mechanism by which vitamin D suppresses colon
cancer in Smad3/ mice is not completely clear, although
our data suggest the anti-inﬂammatory effects of vitamin D are
important. Helicobacter species are Gram negative, microaerophilic bacteria that can induce local production of proinﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines through TLR4 signaling
and subsequent activation of the MAPK and NFkB pathways
(25). Both of these pathways have been shown to be upregulated in human patients with IBD (38) and are thought to be
important links between inﬂammation and cancer (38–40). In
vitro evidence suggests that vitamin D is able to suppress
MAPK activity and subsequent proinﬂammatory cytokine
production through the upregulation of MAPK phosphatase1 (41) and NFkB signaling through the upregulation of IkBa, an
inhibitor of NFkB activation (42), or through decreased expression of the NFkB component RelB, which can lead to inhibition
of dendritic cell differentiation and maturation (43). During the
early inﬂammatory disease phase in Hb-infected Smad3/
mice, vitamin D–high diet was associated with dramatic
decreases in p-P38 in the lamina propria cells, decreased NFkB
activation in epithelial cell populations, and suppressed proinﬂammatory cytokine expression compared with that observed
in infected mice on maintenance diet. On the basis of these
data, we propose a model where vitamin D suppresses inﬂammation by decreasing P38 MAPK activation in lamina propria
cells, resulting in decreased proinﬂammatory cytokine production by those cells, which in turn decreases NFkB activation
in colonic epithelial cells.
We have shown that while increased dietary vitamin D
affords protection against the development of colon cancer,
decreased dietary vitamin D was not sufﬁcient to exacerbate
disease in Smad3/ mice. Because epidemiologic studies
(5, 7, 30) as well as studies utilizing mouse models of colitis
suggest that vitamin D deﬁciency or lack of vitamin D signaling
can exacerbate IBD (44–46), we hypothesized that decreased
dietary vitamin D would exacerbate disease in the Smad3/
mouse model. Interestingly, although the AIN93Null diet sig-

niﬁcantly depleted circulating serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
levels, we did not see exacerbation of Hb-induced inﬂammation or subsequent inﬂammation-associated colon cancer.
These ﬁndings are consistent with the idea that modulation
of inﬂammation is likely responsible for the protection
afforded by increased dietary vitamin D.
In conclusion, increased dietary vitamin D suppresses acute
inﬂammation and consequently neoplastic development in a
mouse model of bacterial-driven colon cancer. While additional studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms through which vitamin D and TGFb interact to afford
protection in this model, these ﬁndings suggest that vitamin D
supplementation may prove useful in the treatment of IBD or
potentially the prevention of inﬂammation-associated cancer
by limiting inﬂammation early in disease development.
