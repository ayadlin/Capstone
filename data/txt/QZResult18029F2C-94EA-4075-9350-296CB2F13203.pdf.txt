Anti-mitotic chemotherapeutic agents such as taxanes
activate the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) to arrest
anaphase onset, but taxane-exposed cells eventually
undergo slippage to exit mitosis. The therapeutic efﬁcacy
of taxanes depends on whether slippage after SAC arrest
culminates in continued cell survival, or in death by
apoptosis. However, the mechanisms that determine these
outcomes remain unclear. Here, we identify a novel role
for cyclin G1 (CCNG1), an atypical cyclin. Increased
CCNG1 expression accompanies paclitaxel-induced,
SAC-mediated mitotic arrest, independent of p53 integrity
or signaling through the SAC component, BUBR1.
CCNG1 overexpression promotes cell survival after
paclitaxel exposure. Conversely, CCNG1 depletion by
RNA interference delays slippage and enhances paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. Consistent with these observations,
CCNG1 ampliﬁcation is associated with signiﬁcantly
shorter post-surgical survival in patients with ovarian
cancer who have received adjuvant chemotherapy with
taxanes and platinum compounds. Collectively, our
ﬁndings implicate CCNG1 in regulating slippage and the
outcome of taxane-induced mitotic arrest, with potential
implications for cancer therapy.

Introduction
Several widely used anti-cancer drugs, including taxanes
such as paclitaxel and docetaxel, and the vinca alkaloids
vinblastine or vincristine, arrest the progression
of cancer cells through mitosis by interfering with
the assembly or dynamics of spindle microtubules,
preventing their attachment to kinetochores (Weaver
and Cleveland, 2005). The failure of microtubuleCorrespondence: Dr AR Venkitaraman, The Medical Research

kinetochore attachments prevents silencing of the
spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), the cellular machinery that blocks anaphase entry until every chromosome has received a bipolar attachment to the mitotic
spindle. Until this criterion is fulﬁlled, the SAC
machinery transmits a ‘wait-anaphase’ signal by inhibiting the anaphase-promoting complex, an E3-ubiquitin
ligase that marks for destruction of several protein
substrates whose elimination is necessary for anaphase
onset. The ‘wait-anaphase’ signal is generated by the
localization of SAC components such as BUB1,
BUBR1, BUB3, MAD1 and MAD2 to kinetochores
that remain unattached to spindle microtubules.
It suppresses CDC20, a component of the anaphasepromoting complex that enables the speciﬁc recognition
of key protein substrates (reviewed in Lew and Burke,
2003; Weaver and Cleveland, 2005; Musacchio and
Salmon, 2007).
Thus, cells exposed to anti-mitotic drugs arrest in
prometaphase for a prolonged period. However, they
eventually exit mitosis even when inhibitory concentrations of the drug remain, a phenomenon termed
adaptation or mitotic slippage (Weaver and Cleveland,
2005). There is evidence to suggest that several cellular
outcomes may then follow. Cells may survive and
continue cycling, sometimes with a polyploid, 4N
content of DNA; stop dividing and undergo senescence;
or activate pathways that lead to cell death (Rieder and
Maiato, 2004). The molecules that link drug-induced
mitotic arrest to these different outcomes remain largely
unrecognized, despite the evidence that they critically
affect the sensitivity of cancer cells to the cytotoxic or
cytostatic effects of many widely used anti-cancer drugs
(Shi et al., 2008). In this paper, we report the results of
experiments that identify one downstream determinant
of the cellular outcomes following SAC activation—the
atypical cyclin G1 (CCNG1).
CCNG1 was ﬁrst identiﬁed as a p53-regulated
transcript induced by DNA damage (Okamoto and
Beach, 1994). It contains a cyclin box near its aminoterminus, but lacks the sequence motifs, characteristic
of other cyclins, which specify periodic destruction
by proteolysis during the cell cycle (Tamura et al.,
1993). Indeed, CCNG1 does not pair with a known
cyclin-dependent kinase, and thus, its biological functions are likely to be distinct, and remain to be
fully elucidated. It is known, however, that CCNG1

CCNG1 regulates the outcome of mitotic arrest

expression can be regulated by p53 following DNA
damage, initiating a feedback loop to control p53 levels
through a mechanism that involves MDM2 (Kimura
and Nojima, 2002; Okamoto et al., 2002). It has
been proposed that these events underpin the participation of CCNG1 in the enforcement of the p53dependent G1-S and G2 checkpoints responsive to
DNA damage.
Unexpectedly, we show here that CCNG1 accumulates in taxane-exposed cells arrested in mitosis in a
manner independent of signaling through p53 or the
SAC, and that it inﬂuences mitotic slippage and cell
survival after taxane exposure. Interestingly, ovarian
cancer patients who have received adjuvant chemotherapy with taxanes and platinum compounds exhibit
poorer survival if their tumors harbor >2 copies of
CCNG1 irrespective of tumor stage. Collectively, our
results identify a novel CCNG1-dependent mechanism
that regulates the outcome of taxane-induced mitotic
arrest, and provide preliminary evidence suggesting its
clinical relevance in ovarian cancer. CCNG1 may
represent a novel regulator of the recently proposed
but poorly characterized processes (Gascoigne and
Taylor, 2009; Huang et al., 2010) that link the timing
of mitotic slippage with the response of cancer cells to
drug-induced mitotic arrest.

Paclitaxel-induced CCNG1 expression is independent
of p53
The induction of CCNG1 protein expression following
cellular stresses such as DNA damage is reported to be
dependent on p53 (Okamoto and Beach, 1994; Bates
et al., 1996). We therefore compared CCNG1 protein
levels in paclitaxel-exposed wild-type HCT116 cells with
those in a p53-null, but otherwise isogenic, HCT116
derivative created by TP53 gene targeting (Bunz et al.,
1998). Although p53 expression steadily increases in
HCT116 cells following the treatment (Figures 1c and d),
CCNG1 expression peaks at 16 h, coincident with the
arrest of B80% of the cells in the mitotic phase of cell
cycle as marked by MPM-2 positive staining, before p53
accumulation. In the p53-null HCT116 p53/ cells,
neither the kinetics nor the level of CCNG1 induction
after paclitaxel exposure was changed, and cell cycle
arrest in the M phase was not signiﬁcantly affected.
Thus, p53 is dispensable for both CCNG1 induction and
mitotic arrest following paclitaxel exposure under these
conditions. The p53-independence of CCNG1 induction
following paclitaxel exposure was also evident when
comparing the osteosarcoma cell line U2OS (p53 wild
type) with its p53-deﬁcient, non-isogenic counterpart
SaOS-2 (data not shown), conﬁrming that these ﬁndings
are not conﬁned to one particular cell type.

Results

Paclitaxel-induced CCNG1 expression does not
require signaling by the SAC
Paclitaxel alters microtubule dynamics, thereby preventing the silencing of the SAC, and thus blocking mitotic
progression (Jordan and Wilson, 2004). However,
several lines of evidence suggest that paclitaxel-induced
CCNG1 expression does not require signaling by the
SAC. First, we ﬁnd that CCNG1 expression is induced
by the exposure of U2OS cells to MG132 (Figure 2),
a proteasome inhibitor that blocks the metaphaseanaphase transition, but without activating the SAC,
by preventing the degradation of mitotic substrates
required for anaphase entry (van Leuken et al., 2008).
U2OS cells were exposed to 5 mM MG132 or 10 mM
paclitaxel for 60 min. Ninety minutes after paclitaxel
release or MG132 treatment, mitotic cells were collected
by mitotic shake-off (MSO) and the level of CCNG1
expression was compared with that in untreated cells.
Notably, CCNG1 expression in MG132-treated cells is
similar to that in paclitaxel-treated cells, suggesting that
CCNG1 induction during mitosis does not require
signaling through the SAC. Similar results were
obtained in Cal51 cells, suggesting that these ﬁndings
are not conﬁned to one particular cell type.
To further verify that paclitaxel-induced CCNG1
expression is independent of SAC signaling, we depleted
the essential SAC component, BUBR1(Meraldi et al.,
2004), from U2OS cells using siRNA, before exposure
to paclitaxel as before (Figure 3a). Serial time-lapse
imaging conﬁrms that BUBR1 depletion suppresses
the mitotic arrest normally triggered by paclitaxel,
allowing anaphase entry and rapid exit from mitosis.
Therefore, to prevent mitotic exit, BUBR1-depleted,

Increased CCNG1 expression accompanies paclitaxelinduced SAC arrest
Asynchronous cultures of the cancer cell lines U2OS,
Cal51 or HCT116 were exposed to 10 mM paclitaxel for
60 min before the drug was washed out (Sena et al., 1999;
Michalakis et al., 2005). CCNG1 protein levels in cell
lysates were determined by western blotting between 2 and
48 h after paclitaxel exposure (Figure 1a). These conditions
of paclitaxel treatment induce an accumulation of cells in
prometaphase, as marked by 4N DNA content and costaining with the mitotic marker MPM-2 (Figure 1b). Prometaphase arrest was also conﬁrmed through microscopic
assessment of chromosome condensation visualized by
40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining (data not shown).
MPM-2 staining increases after drug exposure in all the
cell lines tested, peaking at >60% between 11 and 24 h
after treatment, consistent with activation of the mitotic
SAC. Although untreated cells express relatively low levels
of the protein, CCNG1 protein levels increase sharply after
paclitaxel exposure, exhibiting, for example, an approximately 100  increase 16 h after exposure in the case of the
HCT116 cells (Figure 1a). This increase coincides with the
period of maximal mitotic arrest as determined by MPM-2
expression. CCNG1 protein levels decrease rapidly as cells
undergo mitotic slippage and exit mitosis, and continue to
decrease, but more slowly, over the following 48 h. Similar
effects are elicited when HCT116 cells are treated with the
inhibitors nocodazole or monastrol, which elicit mitotic
arrest by mechanisms different from paclitaxel, suggesting
that the changes in CCNG1 expression represent a general
response to mitotic arrest (Supplementary Figure S1).

(b) Samples of the cells described in (a) were stained with mitotic phosphoprotein monoclonal antibody, MPM-2 and propidium iodide

MPM-2 staining, is shown. (c) Paclitaxel-induced CCNG1 expression is independent of p53. Asynchronous HCT116 cells and their
isogenic p53-null counterparts (HCT116 p53/) were treated with paclitaxel as described before the analysis of CCNG1 and p53
expression by western blotting. (d) Samples of the cells described in (c) were ﬁxed and stained with MPM-2 and PI as described in (b).
Results shown are typical of three or more independent experiments.

paclitaxel-treated cells were exposed to 5 mM MG132
(Brito and Rieder, 2006), as were controls, before
mitotic cells were harvested by MSO (Figure 3b). We
ﬁnd no detectable difference in paclitaxel-induced
CCNG1 expression after BUBR1 depletion, suggesting
that CCNG1 induction during mitosis is independent of
signaling by the SAC (Figure 3c).
Notably, CCNG1 expression is decreased when
paclitaxel-exposed, BUBR1-depleted cells are allowed
to exit mitosis in the absence of MG132 (Figure 3c).
This suggests that CCNG1 expression after paclitaxel
treatment correlates with mitotic arrest rather than SAC

signaling. To further conﬁrm this, we treated Cal51 cells
arrested at the metaphase-anaphase transition following
paclitaxel-induced SAC activation with the Aurora
kinase inhibitor ZM 447439 (ZM). ZM overrides SAC
signaling, enabling mitotic exit (Ditchﬁeld et al., 2003).
Indeed, 12 h after paclitaxel treatment, Cal51 cells
exposed to 2 mm ZM exit mitosis within 90 min
(Figure 3d), accompanied by a decrease in CCNG1
expression to the basal levels found in unchallenged cells
(Figure 3e). Similar observations were recorded in
U2OS cells (data not shown). Thus collectively, our
work demonstrates that paclitaxel-induced CCNG1

time, providing a sensitive measure of SAC enforcement.
Consistent with expectation, the prophase–anaphase
interval is greatly prolonged from a median of 30 min
to 270 min when control cells are exposed to paclitaxel
(Figure 4c). Conversely, and also as expected (Meraldi
et al., 2004; Sudo et al., 2004), the depletion of BUBR1,
an essential SAC component, reduces the prophase–
anaphase interval after paclitaxel treatment to a median
of 21 min. Interestingly, the depletion of CCNG1 using
either of the two sequence-independent siRNAs signiﬁcantly increased the mitotic delay induced by paclitaxel,
prolonging the prophase–anaphase interval to a median
of 381 min (P ¼ 0.0294) and 474 min (Po0.0001)
(Figure 4d). However, CCNG1 depletion did not alter
the prophase–anaphase interval in unchallenged cells,
suggesting that it is dispensable for normal mitotic
timing. From these results we infer that CCNG1 is not
an essential component of the SAC machinery per se, but
instead, may have a role in promoting slippage and
mitotic exit after SAC activation.

expression is independent of SAC signaling, but instead,

CCNG1 depletion prolongs paclitaxel-induced mitotic
arrest
We therefore tested whether CCNG1 regulates paclitaxelinduced mitotic arrest, using serial time-lapse imaging
to precisely assess mitotic progression in CCNG1depleted or control U2OS cells (Figures 4a and b),
before and after drug exposure. Images were taken every
3 min from the start of cell rounding that starts in late
prophase until the formation of a cleavage furrow in
anaphase A, visualizing at least 25 individual cells per
sample. The cumulative frequency of cells progressing
from prophase to anaphase was then plotted against

CCNG1 depletion promotes paclitaxel-induced cell death
after SAC arrest
It has been proposed (Gascoigne and Taylor, 2008) that
cell survival after drug-induced mitotic arrest is governed
by the extent of mitotic delay, such that a prolonged delay
enhances the likelihood of apoptosis. As CCNG1
depletion prolongs the prophase-anaphase interval after
paclitaxel exposure, we tested its effect on paclitaxelinduced cell death. Cal51 and U2OS cells were transfected
with CCNG1-speciﬁc siRNAs, and were then exposed to
10 mM paclitaxel for 60 min. Cells were harvested at 12 h
after drug treatment, before the maximal induction of
CCNG1 expression (Figures 4a and b), to assess CCNG1
mRNA and protein levels. The viability of the cells was
then assessed by the Promega CellTiter-Blue Cell Viability
Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) over the following
3 days (Figure 4e). siRNA-mediated depletion under
these conditions reduced CCNG1 mRNA by B95%
(Figure 4a) and markedly lowered (but did not entirely
ablate) CCNG1 protein expression (Figure 4b). CCNG1
depletion reduced the viability of both U2OS and Cal51
cells following paclitaxel exposure by 66 and 50% when
compared with the controls. In all cell lines tested, reduced
viability was accompanied by an increase in apoptotic
caspase activity (Supplementary Figure S2). Moreover,
serial time-lapse imaging suggests that CCNG1-depleted
cells undergoing cell death from mitosis (or failing to
complete cytokinesis and forming a single polyploid
nucleus) exhibit an increase in drug-induced mitotic delay
(Supplementary Figure S3). Thus, our results indicate that
the prolongation of paclitaxel-induced mitotic arrest
provoked by CCNG1 depletion is accompanied by an
increase in drug-induced cell death.
CCNG1 over-expressing cells escape paclitaxel-induced
cell death independent of p53
We therefore tested whether CCNG1 overexpression
could conversely enhance cell survival after exposure to
anti-mitotic drugs. To this end, we used a method we

whether cells overexpressing an EGFP-CCNG1 fusion
protein have a survival advantage after paclitaxel
exposure when compared with untransfected cells in
the same culture. Accordingly, HCT116 cells were
transfected (Figure 5a) with either EGFP-CCNG1 or
EGFP, such that no more than 10–30% in each culture
received the ﬂuorophore-expressing construct, whereas
the remaining cells were untransfected. Cultures were

Viable cells that express EGFP-CCNG1 are B2fold

after drug treatment. This advantage was not manifest
in untreated cultures conﬁrming that EGFP-CCNG1
promotes survival only after paclitaxel exposure. Similar
results were obtained in p53/ HCT116 cells
(Figure 5d), demonstrating that EGFP-CCNG1 expression promotes cell survival after SAC activation
independent of p53 integrity.

and the expression of CCNG1 RNA. No association was
found between CCNG1 mRNA expression levels and
patient survival. The lack of such an association in pretreatment tissue samples is not unexpected, as elevated
CCNG1 expression appears to be transiently induced
during drug-induced mitotic arrest. Therefore, CCNG1
gene copy number was assessed by a previously reported

method that is likelihood-based and explicitly takes into
account changes in the total genome size, and contamination of the cancer samples with non-cancerous cells
(Abkevich et al., 2010). The method is capable of
detecting regions with deletions and ampliﬁcations as
well as estimating actual gene copy numbers in these
regions. In contrast to mRNA expression, there was a

CCNG1 regulates the outcome of mitotic arrest

statistically signiﬁcant association between CCNG1 gene
copy number and patient survival. Kaplan–Meier
survival plots (Figure 6) demonstrate that post-surgical
survival in patients with CCNG1 copy number p2
(n ¼ 66) was signiﬁcantly prolonged (P ¼ 0.023) compared with that in patients with CCNG1 copy number
>2 (n ¼ 34). This signiﬁcance holds in multivariate Cox
models after accounting for the residual size of the
ovarian tumor after surgery as well as the tumor stage
(P ¼ 0.009). Collectively, these data suggest that CCNG1
gene copy number is an independent marker of postsurgical survival in patients with ovarian cancer who
have received adjuvant chemotherapy with taxanes and
platinum compounds.

Discussion
Although it has been appreciated for some time that
activation of the mitotic SAC by microtubule-disrupting
agents culminates after mitotic slippage in varied
biological outcomes ranging from apoptosis to survival
and continued division, the mechanisms that couple
checkpoint activation to these outcomes remain largely
unknown. Collectively, the ﬁndings we report in this
paper provide multiple lines of evidence to implicate
CCNG1 as a key determinant of cell survival following
SAC activation. We show that the expression of
CCNG1 protein is enhanced during mitotic arrest in
response to microtubule-disrupting agents (Figure 1,
Supplementary Figure S1), in a manner that does not
require SAC signaling, and is independent of p53 status
(Figures 1–3). The depletion of CCNG1 by RNA
interference does not itself affect normal mitotic timing

Figure 6 CCNG1 ampliﬁcation is associated with signiﬁcantly
shorter post-surgical survival in patients with ovarian cancer.
Kaplan–Meier survival plots show the post-surgical survival in
patients with CCNG1 copy number p2 (n ¼ 66) compared with
that in patients with CCNG1 copy number >2 (n ¼ 34). The plots
demonstrate a statistically signiﬁcant difference in patient survival
(P ¼ 0.023, Wilcoxon–Gehan test).

in unchallenged cells, but instead, prolongs mitotic delay
and reduces slippage after drug-induced SAC arrest
(Figure 4). Notably, the prolongation of drug-induced
mitotic arrest in CCNG1-depleted cells is accompanied
by an increasing drug-induced cell death (Figure 4).
Conversely, over-expression of CCNG1 promotes cell
survival after paclitaxel exposure (Figure 5). Thus
collectively, our ﬁndings suggest that CCNG1 acts as a
determinant of the outcome of drug-induced SAC
activation by regulating slippage.
A similar role for CCNG1 in determining the
outcome of drug-induced SAC arrest is also evident in
the diploid, non-transformed RPE1 cell line (Supplementary Figure S4), suggesting it is not restricted to
cancer cells.
In contrast to prior reports, which demonstrate that
p53 is required for the enhancement of CCNG1
expression after cellular stresses such as DNA damage,
hypoxia or oxidative insults (Okamoto and Beach, 1994;
Okamoto and Prives, 1999), we ﬁnd that paclitaxelinduced CCNG1 expression is independent of p53. The
p53-independence of CCNG1 induction after paclitaxel
exposure is consistent with the enhancement of cell
survival by CCNG1 over-expression even in p53deﬁcient cells; together suggesting that CCNG1 is
indeed a p53-independent effector of the outcome of
SAC activation.
Our ﬁndings have important implications for emerging concepts concerning the relationship between SAC
slippage and cancer cell survival after anti-mitotic
chemotherapy. It has recently been proposed that cell
fate after a delayed mitosis is determined by the relative
activity of two competing networks, respectively mediating the destruction of cyclin B1, or an increasing
apoptotic signal (Gascoigne and Taylor, 2008). If cyclin
B1 degradation outpaces the accumulation of the
apoptotic signal, cells adapt to the checkpoint, exit into
anaphase, and potentially survive. Conversely, the rapid
accumulation of an apoptotic signal above the threshold
required to induce apoptosis, outpacing declining cyclin
B1 levels, culminates in cell death. Our ﬁndings identify
CCNG1 as a novel factor that regulates this cell-fate
decision, and suggest that its depletion promotes druginduced cell death by delaying slippage and prolonging
drug-induced mitotic arrest. These observations are not
only consistent with the model proposed by Gascoigne
and Taylor (Gascoigne and Taylor, 2008), but also
provide fresh insight into the molecular mechanisms
underlying it.
The clinical efﬁcacy of anti-mitotic drugs that activate
the SAC has been correlated not to their ability to
induce mitotic arrest, but to their capacity to trigger
drug-induced apoptosis (Shi et al., 2008). From this
perspective, our work identifying CCNG1 as a determinant of the balance between cell survival/death induced
by microtubule-disrupting agents has several implications for cancer therapy. CCNG1 levels may serve as a
marker of the sensitivity of cancers to anti-mitotic
therapy, independent of p53 mutation status. Moreover,
inhibition of CCNG1 expression or activity may provide
a new approach for therapeutic sensitization to these

agents, again irrespective of p53 mutations. It is noteworthy in this regard that altered CCNG1 expression has
been reported in cancer samples (Reimer et al., 1999; Perez
et al., 2003), and that our ﬁndings suggest that CCNG1
gene ampliﬁcation is an independent prognostic marker of
post-surgical survival in ovarian cancer patients receiving
adjuvant chemotherapy. Thus, the data we report in this
paper provide a strong biologic and experimental rationale
for further investigation of this connection.

Materials and methods
Cell lines, culture, and drug treatment
HCT116, U2OS and Cal51 cells were obtained either from the
ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, LGC Standards,
Middlesex, UK) or Cell Services (Cancer Research UK
London Research Institute, London, UK). HCT116 p53/
cells were a kind gift supplied by Dr B Vogelstein. Cells were
maintained in either McCoy’s 5A or DMEM media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin and streptomycin as directed. Cultures were maintained at 37 1C and at
5% CO2. For paclitaxel treatment experiments, sub-conﬂuent
cells were treated with paclitaxel (Sigma, T7191, Dorset, UK)
in dimethylsulfoxide. Cells were treated with 10 mM paclitaxel
for 60 min before drug was washed out with media. On
harvesting with trypsin, cells were collected by centrifugation
in the presence of all media and phosphate buffer saline (PBS)
washes used. For MG132 treatment, cells were treated with
5 mM Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-al (MG132) (Sigma, C2211) in dimethylsulfoxide. Cells were harvested, as described, after 90 min. For
MSO experiments, sub-conﬂuent cells were gently ﬂushed with
media using a 25 ml pipette at an acute angle. Mitotic cells
were harvested by centrifugation of the media alone.
Cell cycle analysis and mitotic index
Both attached and ﬂoating cells were collected at the indicated
time points and were centrifuged at 1000 r.p.m. for 5 min at room
temperature. Cells were re-suspended in 0.5 ml PBS, ﬁxed by
adding 4.5 ml of ice-cold 70% ethanol, and incubated overnight
in ﬁxative at 4 1C. Before analysis, ﬁxed cells were washed in PBS
and incubated with propidium iodide staining solution (0.1%
Triton X-100 in PBS; 0.02 mg/ml propidium iodide; 0. 2 mg/ml
RnaseA) for 30 min at room temperature in the absence of light.
Analysis was performed on a FACS cytometer (BectonDickinson, Oxford, UK). Unless otherwise stated, 10 000 events
were analyzed per sample, and aggregates were excluded. To
determine the mitotic fraction, cells were collected and ﬁxed as
described above. After treatment with a blocking solution (PBS
containing 2% fetal bovine serum) for 1 h, cells were incubated
with the MPM-2 monoclonal antibody (05-368, Upstate
Technology, Billerica, MA, USA) at 1:100 in the block solution
for 1 h at 37 1C, followed by an incubation with Alexa 488conjugated goat against mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Paisley,
UK) for 1 h at RT. Cells were incubated with propidium iodide
before being analyzed by FACS and the percentage of MPM-2
positive cells was determined.
Immunoblot analysis
Harvested cells were resuspended in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM
Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM
DTT, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride, and protease inhibitors (Roche, Burgess Hill, UK)). After 15 min on ice, lysates
were cleared by centrifugation at 13K r.p.m. for 10 min at 4 1C.
Oncogene

50 mg of protein was run on a NuPAGE Novex 4–12% Bis-Tris
Gel (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). Western blot detection with
antibodies described were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody and an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham, Bucks, UK). Antibodies described
include anti-CCNG1 (NCL-CYCLIN G, Novocastra, Milton
Keynes, UK) at 1:200; anti-b-actin (A5441, Sigma) at 1:5000;
anti-p53 (sc-126, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) at 1:1000; anti-BUBR1
(a kind gift from F. McKeon and S. Taylor) at 1:1000.
Live-cell imaging
As previously described (Daniels et al., 2004), cells were
incubated in Leibovitz L15 medium (Invitrogen). Microscopy
was performed using a Zeiss (Welwyn Garden City, UK)
Axiovert 200 M microscope equipped with a humidiﬁed heated
enclosure, and a UV ﬁlter in the excitation light path. Timelapse images were collected every 3 to 5 min over a period of
48 h. The time taken from the start of cell rounding that starts
in late prophase until the formation of a cleavage furrow in
anaphase was calculated. For each condition, at least 25
individual cells were visualized.
Reverse transfection of siRNAs
Asynchronous cells were reverse transfected with 50 nM siRNA
smartpool speciﬁc BUBR1 (termed BUB1B) (Dharmacon,
Lafayette, CO, USA). Transfections were performed using
Dharmafect 1 (Dharmacon), utilizing the standard protocols.
For CCNG1 depletion, 100 nM of individual siRNAs speciﬁc for
CCNG1 was reverse transfected (D-003216-05, Dharmacon—
designated CCNG1_1 and S102653651, Qiagen (Crawley,
UK)—designated CCNG1_2). For cyclin G1 siRNA-mediated
knockdown, a second forward transfection was performed 24 h
after the initial reverse transfection. AllStars Negative Control
siRNA (Qiagen) were utilized as negative controls, using the
same protocols as required for the target gene.
Quantitiative RT–PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cultures described by use of
the Macherey-Nagel NucleoSpin RNA II Puriﬁcation Kit
(ABgene, Epsom, UK) with the DNase step omitted. Oligo-dT
primed ss-cDNA was generated from the resulting RNA using
the Cloned AMV First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen). Q–PCR using the LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master
mix (Roche) was performed with primers targeting the CCNG1
and PBGD mRNAs and analyzed with the use of the
LightCycler 480 System (Roche). CCNG1 results were normalized to the housekeeping gene, PBGD, utilizing the DDCt
methodology (Schmittgen and Livak, 2008).
Cell viability
The cell viability was assessed by use of the CellTiter-Blue Cell
Viability Assay (Promega). A volume of 5 ml of reagent was
added directly to 100 ml of media and incubated for 90–120 min
at 37 1C depending on the cell type. Data were acquired using the
Fusion Universal Microplate Analyzer (Perkin Elmer, Waltham,
MA, USA). Samples were excited by a Halogen source passed
through a 520/10 BP ﬁlter and ﬂuorescence was assessed for 0.1
secs/well using a 590/10 BP ﬁlter. All data had background
values of reagent plus media without cells subtracted.
Expression of EGFP-CCNG1 fusion protein
A cDNA encoding human CCNG1 was isolated by RT–PCR
using oligonucleotide primers that incorporated XhoI restriction sites. The resulting product after XhoI digestion was
cloned into the SalI site of the pEGFP-C1 plasmid (Clontech,

Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France). The empty vector control
encodes enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein alone. The
pEGFP-CCNG1 plasmid and empty vector was transfected
into HCT116 and HCT116 p53/ cells using lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) following standard protocols. Protein
expression was determined by immunoblots as described
above. Percentage of cells expressing the enhanced green
ﬂuorescent protein species was determined by ﬂow cytometry.
RNA/DNA extraction from frozen human ovarian cancers
Sections of 10 mm thickness from 100 frozen human ovarian
cancers in Tissue-Tek OCT (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) were
homogenized using a TissueRuptor (Qiagen) after adding
QIAzol lysis reagent, followed by RNA isolation using a
QIAgen miRNAeasy MiniKit per manufacturers protocol.
A QIAamp DNA MiniKit (Qiagen) was used to isolate DNA
per manufacturer’s protocol with overnight incubation (56 1C)
and RNaseA treatment.
Affymetrix 500K single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays
In 100 human ovarian cancers, 250 ng of genomic DNA was
processed using GeneChip Mapping NspI or StyI Assay Kit
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) per manufacturer’s

protocol and hybridized to Affymetrix Mapping 500K
NspI or StyI microarrays. After hybridization, array wash,
stain and scan procedures were performed per manufacturer’s
protocol. Copy number analysis for CCNG1 was performed
using a software package described elsewhere (Abkevich et al.,
2010).
