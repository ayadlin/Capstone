Abstract
Inactivating mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex 2
(TSC2) gene, which encodes tuberin, result in the development
of TSC and lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). The tumor
suppressor effect of tuberin lies in its GTPase-activating
protein activity toward Ras homologue enriched in brain
(Rheb), a Ras GTPase superfamily member. The statins,
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors, have
pleiotropic effects which may involve interference with the
isoprenylation of Ras and Rho GTPases. We show that
atorvastatin selectively inhibits the proliferation of Tsc2 /
mouse embryo fibroblasts and ELT-3 smooth muscle cells in
response to serum and estrogen, and under serum-free
conditions. The isoprenoids farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP)
and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) significantly reverse atorvastatin-induced inhibition of Tsc2 / cell growth,
suggesting that atorvastatin dually targets a farnesylated
protein, such as Rheb, and a geranylgeranylated protein, such
as Rho, both of which have elevated activity in Tsc2 / cells.
Atorvastatin reduced Rheb isoprenylation, GTP loading, and
membrane localization. Atorvastatin also inhibited the constitutive phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin,
S6 kinase, and S6 found in Tsc2 / cells in an FPP-reversible
manner and attenuated the high levels of phosphorylated
S6 in Tsc2-heterozygous mice. Atorvastatin, but not rapamycin, attenuated the increased levels of activated RhoA in
Tsc2 / cells, and this was reversed by GGPP. These results
suggest that atorvastatin may inhibit both rapamycin-sensitive and rapamycin-insensitive mechanisms of tuberin-null
cell growth, likely via Rheb and Rho inhibition, respectively.
Atorvastatin may have potential therapeutic benefit in TSC
syndromes, including LAM. [Cancer Res 2007;67(20):9878–86]

Introduction
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a tumor suppressor gene
syndrome characterized by multiple tumors of the brain, kidney,
heart, and skin (1, 2). Mutations in two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, are
causally linked to the development of TSC. Our current
understanding of the tumor suppressor effect of hamartin and

tuberin, the protein products of TSC1 and TSC2, respectively,
relates to the GTPase-activating protein function of tuberin toward
the small GTPase Ras homologue enriched in brain (Rheb; refs.
1–4). Rheb is a major regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin
complex 1 (mTORC1), which controls a pathway that mediates
protein synthesis and cell growth (5). Thus, in cells lacking
functional hamartin or tuberin, elevated levels of active Rheb (GTPRheb) lead to constitutive activation of mTOR resulting in
phosphorylation of downstream p70 S6 kinase (S6K), S6, and
4EBP1 (6–8) to increase protein translation and cell growth. Recent
attention has focused on mTORC1 as a therapeutic target to
address the uncontrolled cell and tumor growth that occurs in TSC
and TSC-related conditions, including lymphangioleiomyomatosis
(LAM), a proliferative smooth muscle disorder affecting the lung
(9, 10). Rapamycin inhibits the constitutively activated forms of
S6K and S6 and 4EBP1 that are thought to contribute to TSC2-null
cell growth. Concerns over long-term effects of rapamycin as an
immunosuppressant, and agent that potentially stimulates feedback signaling leading to oncogenic Akt (11–13), have led to a
search for additional agents that target the Rheb-mTOR-S6K-S6
pathway.
Rheb belongs to the Ras family of G proteins (5). During their
synthesis, Ras family G proteins undergo post-translational
modifications resulting in the attachment of isoprenoid lipid
moieties (14, 15). This isoprenylation step is necessary for the
biological activity of small G proteins and enables them to
associate with relevant membranes for downstream signaling
(14, 15). Ras-related G proteins are typically farnesylated (15). In
contrast, Rho G proteins are typically geranylgeranylated, whereas
RhoB undergoes both geranylgeranylation and farnesylation (14).
Small G proteins are GTPases that cycle between active GTP-bound
and inactive GDP-bound forms, and upstream signals trigger
activation of G proteins and propagation of their downstream
responses. The role of RhoA, which is geranylgeranylated, and its
effector, Rho kinase (ROCK), in controlling smooth muscle cell
contractility, nonmuscle cell cytoskeletal organization, cell cycle
progression, and apoptosis has been extensively studied (16). In
contrast, less is known about Rheb function and properties. Studies
suggest that Rheb, which is constitutively activated in tuberin-null
states, is exclusively farnesylated and that, importantly, the
farnesylation of Rheb is critical for mTORC1 kinase activity toward
S6K (17–19).
The statins are a family of pharmacologic agents that are best
known for their cholesterol lowering effect (20). Statins are specific
inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, a rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol (21).
Isoprenoids geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) and farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP), which lie downstream of mevalonate, are

metabolic products of the HMG-CoA pathway (20, 21). As a result
of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition, the statins also inhibit the
synthesis of downstream isoprenoids. The process of isoprenylation ( farnesylation and/or geranylgeranylation) of Ras/Rho family
proteins is required for G protein activity. At least some of the
pleiotropic benefits of statins that are independent of the
cholesterol lowering effect are thought to involve interference
with the normal synthesis of isoprenoids, thereby impairing Ras/
Rho G protein function (reviewed in ref. 22).
Atorvastatin (also known as Lipitor), a third-generation synthetic
statin that is widely used clinically, is a member of the lipophilic
class of statins. Based on the observations that loss of tuberin leads
to constitutively activated Rheb, and that tuberin-null cells additionally contain elevated levels of GTP-RhoA (23), we investigated
whether atorvastatin is a potential pharmacologic inhibitor of
tuberin-null cell growth. Here, we describe significant and selective
mitigation of tuberin-null cultured cell growth by atorvastatin.
Furthermore, we show that atorvastatin blocks Rheb isoprenylation
and downstream phosphorylation of mTOR-S6K-S6 (rapamycinsensitive pathway), in addition to blocking RhoA activity (rapamycin insensitive) in tuberin-null cells, both of which are thought to
contribute to the cell growth advantage observed in tuberindeficient states.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and inhibitors. Atorvastatin calcium in powder form was
obtained from Pfizer, Inc. and dissolved in ethanol as recommended.
Inhibitors used were the Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y27632 (Calbiochem),
the farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI-277), and geranylgeranyl transferase
inhibitor (GGTI-298; Sigma). Mevalonate (100 Amol/L), FPP (10 Amol/L),
GGPP (10 Amol/L), ubiquinone (30 Amol/L), and squalene (100 Amol/L)
were from Sigma. Unless otherwise stated, treatments were for 24 to 48 h at
the doses indicated in the text.
Cell culture. For descriptive purposes, tuberin-null cells are denoted
Tsc2 / and tuberin-expressing cells are denoted Tsc2 +/+. ELT-3 cells are
uterine-derived leiomyoma tumor cells cultured from the Eker rat that was
obtained from and characterized by Dr. Cheryl Walker (M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center, Houston, TX) and reexpression of the Tsc2 gene in ELT-3
cells is described elsewhere (24). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were
obtained from Tsc2 +/+ and Tsc2 / littermate controls and immortalized by
knockout of the p53 gene (25). MEFs and human embryonic kidney cells
(HEK293; American Type Culture Collection) were grown in DMEM
containing 10% serum.
Cell growth assays. Cell growth was assessed by Coulter counting and
[3H]thymidine incorporation. For Coulter counting, cells were seeded at a
density of 0.5  104 to 1  104 on 12-well plates and grown overnight.
Serum was withdrawn for 72 h (ELT-3) and 24 h (MEFs). Following serum
withdrawal, cells were counted in a Model Z1 Coulter Counter (Beckman
Coulter) to obtain day 0 values. Treatments with serum and/or atorvastatin
were at the doses indicated in the text and cells were counted again after
specific times. Cell counts were expressed as fold growth compared with
day 0. The incorporation of [3H]thymidine was done as described previously
(24). All experiments were done in duplicate and repeated at least twice for
reproducibility.
Cell transfection. Wild-type (WT) Rheb, farnesylation mutant Rheb
(C181S Rheb), and corresponding empty vector were gifts from Dr. Joseph
Avruch (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA), Dr. Andrew Tee
(University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom), and Dr. Richard Lamb
(Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom). HEK293 cells were
grown to 60% confluence on 10-cm dishes and transfected with plasmids
using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen).
Immunoblot analysis. Preparation of cell lysates and immunoblot
analysis was done as described (24). Primary antibodies used were against
phosphorylated p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), p42/44

www.aacrjournals.org

MAPK, phosphorylated Akt (Ser473), Akt, phosphorylated S6, S6, phosphorylated S6K, S6K, phosphorylated mTOR, mTOR, caspase-3 (Cell Signaling
Technology), tuberin, Rheb, and RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Secondary horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antibody (Cell Signaling
Technology) was used with chemiluminescent signal detection by enhanced
chemiluminescence (Cell Signaling Technology). Semiquantitative densitometric analysis was done by ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics).
On images where weak or no bands were observed, densitometry was done
on overexposed immunoblots. Data were expressed as fold activation
relative to control.
Immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation of mTOR was done using
a protocol published by Kim et al. (26).
GTP-RhoA pull-down assay. Cellular GTP-RhoA was affinity purified
using glutathione S-transferase-rhotekin Rho binding domain agarose
beads (Upstate/Millipore) following the manufacturer’s recommendation.
Subcellular fractionation. The protocol described by Sterpetti et al.
(27) was used.
In vivo Rheb guanine nucleotide binding. A modified form of the
method described in ref. 28 was used. ELT-3 cells were grown to 50%
confluence, and serum was withdrawn and treated with atorvastatin or
vehicle for 72 h. Cells were washed, incubated with phosphate-free DMEM
for 1 h, and labeled with 0.25 mCi/mL of [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham)
for 4 h. Cells were harvested and lysates were adjusted to 0.5 mol/L NaCl
before immunoprecipitation for 1 h with protein G-Sepharose beads that
were preincubated overnight with 20 Ag of anti-Rheb (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Nucleotides were eluted a 68jC and resolved by TLC.
[32P]GTP and [32P]GDP were quantified by phosphorimager and ImageQuant software. The percentage GTP-bound Rheb was calculated and
normalized for moles of phosphate (27).
Animals. All procedures were approved by the Children’s Hospital
Animal Care and Use Committee. Twelve-week-old male and female mice
heterozygous for Tsc2 (29) were treated with atorvastatin given at 100 mg/
kg/d by gavage for 2 weeks. Controls were treated with vehicle control (0.5%
methyl cellulose) at the same volume. Tissues were homogenized by Dounce
homogenizer and lysates were prepared as described above.
Statistical analysis. Results are expressed as mean F SD. Statistical
analysis using a nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with Dunn’s multiple
comparison test for follow-up analysis was done using GraphPad Prism 3.0
software.

Results
Atorvastatin inhibits the growth of Tsc2 / cells. Studies
have shown that members of the statin family can inhibit cell
growth (28). We tested the potential inhibitory effect of
atorvastatin on ELT-3 cells and MEFs and compared Tsc2 +/+ and
Tsc2 / cells (Fig. 1). Cultured cells were treated with 10% serum in
the presence of vehicle or atorvastatin and the growth curves were
examined. Dose-dependent growth inhibition of both Tsc2 +/+ and
Tsc2 / cells was observed in response to atorvastatin (Fig. 1A).
Moreover, increased sensitivity of Tsc2 / cells relative to Tsc2 +/+
cells with statistically significant inhibition of cell counts at
1 Amol/L atorvastatin was observed. The IC50 for Tsc2 / cells was
lower than that for Tsc2 +/+ cells [Tsc2 +/+ MEFs (1.71 Amol/L) versus
Tsc2 / MEFs (0.69 Amol/L); Tsc2 +/+ ELT-3 (2.75 Amol/L) versus
Tsc2 / ELT-3 (0.89 Amol/L)]. Similarly, significant inhibition of
serum-induced incorporation of [3H]thymidine was observed in
Tsc2 / cells compared with Tsc2 +/+ cells, indicating that the
increased sensitivity of Tsc2 / cell growth to atorvastatin is
paralleled by inhibition of DNA synthesis.
We have previously shown that the growth advantage conferred
by the loss of tuberin in ELT-3 cells is most apparent under
conditions of serum withdrawal (30) and that Tsc2 / ELT-3 cell
growth is also estrogen responsive (24). Figure 1B shows that

actin provided a loading control.

continued growth of Tsc2 / ELT-3 cells (and MEFs; Supplementary Data) in the absence of serum is significantly inhibited by
atorvastatin without any apparent effect on Tsc2 +/+ cell growth.
Under identical serum-free conditions, significant inhibition of
[3H]thymidine incorporation was also observed in Tsc2 / ELT-3
cells. Similarly, atorvastatin inhibited the estrogen-stimulated
growth in Tsc2 / cells with no effect on Tsc2 +/+ cells (Fig. 1C).
The observed reduction in cell number by higher doses of
atorvastatin of Tsc2 / cells below control cell levels in the
absence of serum (Fig. 2A) suggested that atorvastatin may induce
cell death. Concordantly, atorvastatin also resulted in increased
cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; Fig. 1D), a substrate
for caspase-3, the activation of which is a terminal event for
apoptosis, an observation that was more apparent in Tsc2 / MEFs
compared with Tsc2 / ELT-3 cells.
Inhibition of Tsc2 / cell growth by atorvastatin is reversed
by FPP and GGPP isoprenoids. The observed antiproliferative

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (20). October 15, 2007

effects of atorvastatin could be due to targeting any of the
downstream products of HMG-CoA reductase (outlined in schema
in Supplementary Data), including the isoprenoids FPP and GGPP,
and/or other byproducts, such as ubiquinone and squalene. To
examine the targets downstream of HMG-CoA that mediate the
inhibitory effect of atorvastatin, we tested cell growth in the
presence and absence of these downstream products. Atorvastatininduced inhibition of Tsc2 / cell growth was reversed by
mevalonate supplement, a compound that lies at the apex of
the cholesterol biosynthesis cascade (20). Furthermore, significant
reversal of atorvastatin-induced growth inhibition was observed
in response to GGPP and FPP. In contrast, no reversal was
observed by ubiquinone or squalene supplement. These data
suggested that atorvastatin exerts its effects on Tsc2 / cells by
inhibiting protein prenylation. Consistent with this observation,
we found that, under conditions of serum withdrawal, either
a farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI-277) or a geranylgeranyl

transferase inhibitor (GGTI-298) selectively and dose dependently
inhibits Tsc2 / cell growth, and the combination has an additive
effect that approached the inhibition seen with atorvastatin (shown
in Supplementary Data). In contrast, no growth of Tsc2 +/+ cells was
observed with resulting minimal effects of farnesyl transferase
inhibitor and geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor.
Atorvastatin inhibits the prenylation of Rheb. Farnesylation
of Rheb is important for Tsc2 / cell growth (17). We tested the
effect of atorvastatin on Rheb prenylation by immunoblot (Fig. 2A).
A shift in Rheb to a slower migrating form that corresponds to the
unprenylated form was observed in both Tsc2 +/+ and Tsc2 / ELT3 cells, indicating that atorvastatin treatment interferes with Rheb
prenylation.
Atorvastatin inhibits the downstream phosphorylation of
mTOR-S6K-S6. In tuberin-deficient states, constitutively active

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (20). October 15, 2007

Rheb leads to downstream constitutive phosphorylation of
mTOR-S6K-S6 to regulate cell size and protein synthesis (18).
The effect of atorvastatin on these downstream mediators of cell
growth in tuberin-null states was next examined. We observed
significant inhibition of mTOR phosphorylation using an
antibody directed at the autophosphorylation site of mTOR, a
finding that was replicated in MEFs but best observed in the
ELT-3 cell line (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, reduced association
between endogenous mTOR and Rheb in atorvastatin-treated
Tsc2 +/+ and Tsc2 / cells was observed, a process that was
reversed by FPP supplement.
Immunoblot analysis for phosphorylated forms of S6K and S6
showed significant dose-dependent inhibition of the constitutive
phosphorylation of S6K and S6 by atorvastatin in Tsc2 / ELT-3 cells
(Fig. 2C) with parallel data replicated in Tsc2 / MEFs (data not

shown). In contrast, no inhibition of phosphorylated p42/44
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 MAPK or phosphorylated Akt was observed in Tsc2 / cells nor was there inhibition of
phosphorylated S6K or phosphorylated S6 in Tsc2 +/+ cells. It should
be noted in the Fig. 2C graphs that, although the Tsc2+/+ cell
phosphorylated S6K and phosphorylated S6 bands were not visible,
they were set to the same starting fold value as for Tsc2 / cells for
ease of comparing any change. Interestingly, in ELT-3 cells, a slight
reduction in Akt phosphorylation was seen in Tsc2 +/+ cells in
response to atorvastatin. Under identical conditions to the rescue
studies described above, atorvastatin-induced inhibition of S6 and
S6K phosphorylation was reversed by FPP, whereas no rescue was
observed by GGPP, ubiquinone, or squalene (Fig. 2D).
Inhibition of Rheb prenylation is critical for the growthinhibitory effect of atorvastatin. In tuberin-deficient states,
levels of GTP-Rheb are increased, leading to the downstream
activation of mTORC1-S6K (3, 4). We measured the levels of
endogenous GTP-Rheb in ELT-3 cells in response to atorvastatin.
As expected, GTP-Rheb levels in Tsc2 / cells were higher

compared with Tsc2 +/+ cells; moreover, this was reduced by
atorvastatin (Fig. 3A). Using ectopically expressed WT Rheb in
HEK293 cells, we observed f60% GTP-Rheb levels, in keeping with
other reports (18, 31), which were reduced by atorvastatin
treatment. In contrast, the levels of GTP loading of a mutant form
of Rheb that is resistant to farnesylation, C181S Rheb, were lower
than that of WT Rheb. We next assayed the growth of HEK293 cells
overexpressing WT or C181S Rheb (Fig. 3B) and the response to
atorvastatin. WT Rheb expression was associated with a modest
but significant growth advantage that was significantly and dose
dependently inhibited by atorvastatin compared with control cells.
In contrast, cells expressing C181S Rheb were resistant to the
growth-inhibitory effects of atorvastatin.
Atorvastatin leads to altered Rheb membrane association in
Tsc2 / cells. We investigated the membrane localization of
endogenous Rheb in response to atorvastatin by subcellular
fractionation of serum-deprived ELT-3 cells (Fig. 3C). Under
serum-free conditions, the majority of Rheb was cytosolic in
Tsc2 +/+ cells, and this was unchanged by atorvastatin treatment.

by attenuating Rheb and Rho function, respectively.

Increased amounts of membrane-associated Rheb, as reflected by a
reduction in the S100 to P100 ratio, were found in Tsc2 / cells
compared with Tsc2 +/+ cells (Tsc2 +/+, 2.05 + 0.18; Tsc2 / , 1.59 F
0.20). Treatment of Tsc2 / cells with atorvastatin led to a
considerable reduction in the amount of membrane-bound Rheb,
as reflected in an increase in the S100 to P100 ratio (Tsc2 /
control, 1.59 F 0.20; atorvastatin, 3.25 F 0.28). The majority of
mTOR was membrane associated and its localization was
unchanged by atorvastatin. These results suggest that atorvastatin
inhibits the membrane localization of Rheb in Tsc2-null cells.
Atorvastatin inhibits in vivo phosphorylation of S6. Loss of
Tsc2 expression is associated with constitutive phosphorylation of
S6. We investigated the in vivo effect of atorvastatin on Tsc2heterozygous mice. All mice tolerated atorvastatin or vehicle with
no apparent side effects. Immunoblot analysis of tissue lysates
showed reduction in the level of phosphorylated S6 in lung and
kidney (Fig. 3D).
Atorvastatin inhibits the activity of RhoA in Tsc2 / cells.
Our Fig. 2A data suggest that atorvastatin inhibits the growth of
Tsc2 / cells in a manner that is partially GGPP dependent. Rheb is
normally farnesylated and its signaling is impaired when it is
farnesylation deficient (17, 19), suggesting that other geranylgeranylated proteins, such as Rho GTPase, are targeted by atorvastatin. Given the role of Rho in cell morphology, we examined cell
phenotype in the presence and absence of atorvastatin. Alteration
in cell phenotype was only observed in Tsc2 / cells treated with
atorvastatin with significant rounding of cells noted (Fig. 4A).
Furthermore, significant reversal of atorvastatin-induced phenotype was observed by mevalonate or GGPP supplement, suggesting
that atorvastatin selectively exerts its morphologic effect by
inhibiting geranylgeranylation in Tsc2 / cells. The Y27632 ROCK
inhibitor led to a modest reduction in Tsc2 / cell growth,
supporting a role for Rho in Tsc2 / cell growth. Furthermore,
Tsc2 / ELT-3 cells contained increased levels of active GTP-RhoA
compared with Tsc2 +/+ cells. Interestingly, the elevated levels of
GTP-RhoA in Tsc2 / cells were not inhibited by rapamycin (Fig. 4B).
In contrast, atorvastatin effectively reduced the elevated levels
of GTP-RhoA in Tsc2 / cells, and this was reversed by GGPP
and not FPP. Tsc2 / cells also contained increased levels of
membrane-associated RhoA compared with Tsc2 +/+ cells (Tsc2 +/+,
1.96 + 0.56; Tsc2 / , 1.40 F 0.09; Fig. 4C). Furthermore, treatment
with atorvastatin led to a strong reduction in membraneassociated RhoA in Tsc2 / cells as reflected by a 5.7-fold increase
in the S100 to P100 ratio (Tsc2 / control, 1.4 + 0.09; atorvastatin,
8.06 F 3.15) compared with a 2.1-fold increase in the S100 to
P100 ratio in Tsc2 +/+ cells (Tsc2 +/+ control, 1.96 F 0.56; atorvastatin,
4.16 + 1.27). These data suggest that RhoA contributes to the
growth advantage of tuberin-null states and that atorvastatin can
mitigate this rapamycin-insensitive pathway.

Discussion
In this study, we show for the first time that a statin, such as
atorvastatin, selectively inhibits the growth of Tsc2 / cells
compared with Tsc2 +/+ cells. Moreover, we show that atorvastatin
can impair Rheb GTPase activity and function, which has not been
shown before. Furthermore, we show that atorvastatin attenuates
Rheb-mTOR complex formation and mTOR-S6K activity in Tsc2 /
cells. The growth inhibition is associated with reduction of Rheb
function and signaling as well as reduced RhoA function. The
findings of growth inhibition and altered Rheb/Rho function in two

unrelated Tsc2 / cell types, MEFs and the rat ELT-3 smooth
muscle line, indicate that these are dependent on tuberin
deficiency rather than a chance event. The antiproliferative activity
of statins is associated with the lipophilic statins, such as
atorvastatin, used here (28). Significant inhibition of cellular
proliferation was achieved at lower doses of atorvastatin in
Tsc2 / cells compared with Tsc2 +/+ cells, the latter requiring a
5- to 10-fold higher dose of atorvastatin for the same reduction,
evident with and without serum. Serum concentrations of statins
vary from 10 to 200 nmol/L when prescribed as anticholesterol
agents in humans. The antiproliferative effect as low as 100 nmol/L
noted here in the absence of serum, and 1,000 nmol/L with serum,
suggests a possible overlap with anticholesterol serum levels, albeit
at the lower range, although the short-term (24–48 h) administration of atorvastatin in cell culture used here is difficult to compare
with oral statin administration over months/years. Moreover,
recent published human studies (32) show that higher statin doses
are relatively well tolerated, presenting the possibility that the
effective dose in culture may be near clinically relevant levels. In
keeping with the selective antiproliferative effect of atorvastatin in
Tsc2 / cells, lower concentrations of atorvastatin (1 Amol/L) were
also required for the induction of cleaved PARP compared with
Tsc2 +/+ cells, suggesting that at least some of the inhibitory effect of
atorvastatin on Tsc2 / cells seems to involve a selective apoptotic
response as measured by cleaved PARP. Although some difference
in levels of sensitivity of Tsc2 / MEFs and ELT-3 cells to
atorvastatin-induced apoptosis was observed, the inhibitory effect
was comparable. The effect of statins on cell cycle and apoptosis
seems independent of each other and both can occur in the same
cell line at different concentrations (33). Our data suggest that
statins are efficacious inhibitors of cell growth independent of the
balance between proliferation and apoptosis in tuberin-null cells.
Unlike tuberin-expressing cells, tuberin-deficient cells show a
growth response to estrogen in the absence of serum (24), and
our finding that atorvastatin inhibits this response is intriguing.
Recent data suggest that Rheb is involved in the proliferative
response to estrogen (34), and statins inhibit the growth of breast
cancer cells in response to estradiol (35–37). Thus, the mechanisms
involved in estrogen-induced Tsc2 / cell growth and the action
of statins, whether overlapping or not with estrogen-responsive
breast cancer cells, warrant further investigation, especially in light
of the fact that LAM, a TSC2 deficiency syndrome, occurs mainly in
women.
Our finding that mevalonate blocks the inhibitory effect of
atorvastatin on Tsc2 / cell growth indicates that the effects are
HMG-CoA reductase pathway dependent rather than independent.
Mevalonate is the precursor of the isoprenoids FPP and GGPP, and
the finding that FPP or GGPP, though not squalene or ubiquinone,
results in significant reversion of inhibition indicates that
isoprenylation is targeted. These findings are in keeping with the
literature showing that tumor cells are often more sensitive than
their normal counterparts to statin-mediated growth inhibition via
isoprenoid-mediated suppression (28). Complete reversion of
atorvastatin effects in Tsc2 / cells seemed to require both
isoprenoids, suggesting that inhibition of both farnesylation
and geranylgeranylation contributes to the antigrowth effects of
atorvastatin in Tsc2 / cells. This was independently confirmed by
the use of farnesyl transferase inhibitor and geranylgeranyl
transferase inhibitors, both of which were inhibitory toward Tsc2 /
cells, with an additive effect. These results, and the knowledge
that Rheb and Rho, which are prenylated, are implicated in Tsc2 /

Atorvastatin Inhibits TSC2-Null Cell Growth

cell growth lead us to conclude that both GTPases are statin
targets.
In support of the concept that atorvastatin targets Rheb, our
data identified the slower mobility form of Rheb corresponding to
unprenylated Rheb after statin treatment. Its presence in both
Tsc2 +/+ and Tsc2 / cells and the comparable inhibition of RhebmTOR interaction in both Tsc2 +/+ and Tsc2 / cells suggest that
atorvastatin is pharmacologically active in both cell types. Yet, the
selective inhibition by atorvastatin of cell growth only occurs in
Tsc2 / cells. Concordantly, a selective effect of atorvastatin on the
kinase activity of mTOR as measured by S6K/S6 phosphorylation
was also found in Tsc2 / but not Tsc2 +/+ cells. We interpret these
results within the context of reports showing that, whereas RhebmTOR binding per se is unaffected by GTP-Rheb, the kinase
activity of mTOR toward S6K is GTP-Rheb dependent (18). Thus,
we propose that reduced Rheb prenylation by atorvastatin
selectively affects Tsc2 / cells because Rheb is in its constitutively
GTP-bound active form in TSC2-null states. This conclusion is also
supported by the selective statin response on GTP-Rheb levels in
Tsc2 / ELT-3 cells and in cells overexpressing Rheb where 60% of
Rheb is GTP bound (18).
It could be argued that the reduced levels of Rheb bound to
mTOR in atorvastatin-treated cells are due to reduced total Rheb
levels. However, we did not observe a reduction in total Rheb levels
by statin treatment. On the contrary, inhibition of isoprenylation of
G proteins by statin frequently leads to decreased degradation
resulting in the accumulation of inactive total G protein in the
cytosol (38), an effect that was most evident for Rheb in Fig. 2A.
The finding that atorvastatin targets Rheb function is further
supported by the Rheb overexpression and localization studies. We
show that statin inhibits Rheb-induced proliferation, whereas the
reversal by C181S Rheb indicates the statin effect on Rheb
prenylation is important in mediating growth inhibition. Reports
have shown that, when overexpressed, a significant amount of
Rheb lies at or near plasma or organelle membranes (39–42). Our
study is the first to examine the cellular localization of endogenous
Rheb, although the fractionation method used here does not
distinguish organelle versus plasma membrane. The finding that
both Tsc2 +/+ and Tsc2 / cells contain cytosolic endogenous Rheb
and a relatively low GTP-Rheb fraction may be explained by the
condition of serum deprivation. However, Tsc2 / cells contain an
increased fraction of membrane-associated Rheb, in keeping with
the increased levels of GTP-Rheb in these cells. The reduction of
membrane-associated Rheb fraction in Tsc2 / cells by atorvastatin agrees with the growth-inhibitory property of statins. Although
the majority of mTOR appears in the membrane fraction, this may
be partly influenced by its large size.
In addition to its selective effect on cell growth, atorvastatin
treatment also selectively leads to rounding of Tsc2 / but not
Tsc2 +/+ cells (Fig. 4A). It is well recognized that the rounding
response of cells, such as fibroblasts, is induced by Rho inactivation
(43), as is statin-induced cell rounding (44), and the reversal of

rounding by GGPP is concordant with Rho as a statin target
in Tsc2 / cells. The finding of increased levels of active RhoA
in Tsc2 / cells that are rapamycin insensitive agrees with
Goncharova et al. (23) and supports a role for RhoA in Tsc2 /
growth. Interestingly, atorvastatin inhibits the elevated GTP-RhoA
levels in Tsc2 / cells, and this is reversed by GGPP. The reduced
RhoA membrane localization by statin treatment in both cell types
is concordant with other reports of statin effects on Rho
localization (38), although the additional inhibitory effect on
Rho-GTP loading by atorvastatin is selective for Tsc2 / cells.
RhoA may regulate Janus-activated kinase-signal transducers and
activators of transcriptions (45), the latter that may be dysregulated
in tuberin-null cells (46), and the mechanism of RhoA-mediated
Tsc2 / cell growth warrants additional investigation.
Our results support the model (Fig. 4D) that atorvastatin
treatment of Tsc2 / cells attenuates Rheb and RhoA function,
with concordant inhibition of the dual pathways of tuberin-null cell
growth: the rapamycin-sensitive Rheb-mTORC1-S6K-S6 pathway
and the rapamycin-insensitive activation of RhoA (23, 29, 47). Our
study did not detect inhibition of p42/44 ERK MAPK phosphorylation by atorvastatin, suggesting that the statin effects on Tsc2 /
cells are not mediated via Ras. Although potential atorvastatin
effects on other prenylated proteins cannot be absolutely ruled out,
the unique roles of Rheb and Rho in TSC2-null cell growth, based on
their altered function due to TSC2 mutation, are well recognized by
genetic model systems and mammalian cell studies (18, 40), thus
particularly implicating them in the differential statin effect on
TSC2-null cells. The growth-inhibitory effects of statins have led to
their consideration as potential pharmacologic agents for the
treatment of cancer and are currently being evaluated in clinical
trials (28, 48). Our finding that short-term atorvastatin administration to Tsc2-heterozygous mice attenuates the high levels of
phosphorylated S6 found in these mice in lung and kidney, two sites
involved in LAM and TSC, suggests that statins may be efficacious
in vivo. Furthermore, their relative long-term safety profile supports
advocating their potential use as an alternative or adjunct to rapamycin therapy, particularly in light of recent studies linking longterm rapamycin treatment with Akt induction and associated
oncogenesis (49). Lastly, further studies of statin effects may provide
additional insight into tuberin-null cell growth, leading to potential
new therapeutic targets for TSC and LAM.
