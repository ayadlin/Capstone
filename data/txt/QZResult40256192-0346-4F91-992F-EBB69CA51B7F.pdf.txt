Abstract
Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are associated with increased breast cancer incidence and mortality,
whereas carbohydrate-restricted ketogenic diets ameliorate T2D and suppress breast cancer. These observations suggest an inherent efﬁcacy of nonesteriﬁed long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) in suppressing T2D and
breast tumorigenesis. In this study, we investigated novel antidiabetic MEDICA analogues consisting of
methyl-substituted LCFA that are neither b-oxidized nor esteriﬁed to generate lipids, prompting interest in
their potential efﬁcacy as antitumor agents in the context of breast cancer. In the MMTV-PyMT oncomouse
model of breast cancer, in which we conﬁrmed that tumor growth could be suppressed by a carbohydraterestricted ketogenic diet, MEDICA treatment suppressed tumor growth, and lung metastasis, promoting a
differentiated phenotype while suppressing mesenchymal markers. In human breast cancer cells, MEDICA
treatment attenuated signaling through the STAT3 and c-Src transduction pathways. Mechanistic investigations suggested that MEDICA suppressed c-Src–transforming activity by elevating reactive oxygen species
production, resulting in c-Src oxidation and oligomerization. Our ﬁndings suggest that MEDICA analogues
may offer therapeutic potential in breast cancer and overcome the poor compliance of patients to dietary
carbohydrate restriction. Cancer Res; 74(23); 6991–7002. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in
women. Mammary carcinoma develops in stages consisting
of early hyperplastic ductal lesions that progress to adenoma, carcinoma in situ and lung metastasis. Mice expressing
the Polyoma Middle T antigen (PyMT) driven by the mammary MMTV promoter (MMTV-PyMT) are widely used as
the animal model for human breast cancer (reviewed in
ref. 1). Thus, similarly to human tumors, mammary carcinoma in MMTV-PyMT mice develops in stages consisting
of early hyperplastic lesions located on end buds of collecting ducts, which progress to adenoma/mammary intraepithelial neoplasia, carcinoma in situ and lung metastasis
(2). PyMT-induced survival is due to a strictly ordered
sequence whereby PyMT binds ﬁrst to the protein phosphatase PP2A, followed by recruitment of a member of the c-Src
family tyrosine kinases, usually pp60c-src, to the PyMT/PP2A

complex (3). Binding to PyMT/PP2A promotes c-Src "open"
conformation and autophosphorylation of its Tyr416, resulting in activating its kinase activity and in phosphorylating
PyMT tyrosines. Three of these phosphotyrosines act as
binding sites for the SH2 or PTB domains of ShcA [PyMT
(Tyr250)], PI3K [PyMT(Tyr315)], and PLCg [PyMT(Tyr322)],
resulting in activating the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK, PI3K/
PDK1/Akt, and PLCg/PKC survival pathways, respectively
(1). Association of the PyMT/PP2A/c-Src complex with the
plasma membrane is required for its transforming activity
(4), implying that the complex may be visualized as an
oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), with c-Src acting
as its obligatory tyrosine kinase. In addition to c-Src, MMTVPyMT breast cancer is driven by STAT3 (5), being activated
by phosphorylation of its Tyr705 by activated c-Src (5–7) or
JAK (8). Indeed, dephosphorylation of the gp130/JAK complex by the tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 is reported to result in
suppressing PyMT-induced transformation, while knocking
down Shp2 potentiates PyMT tumorigenesis (9). The c-Src/
STAT3 interplay that drives PyMT-induced transformation
is similar to that previously reported for the large tumor
antigen of the Simian virus 40 (10, 11). Because 70% of
human breast cancers express c-Src (12), whereas 50%
express constitutive STAT3 (13), treatment strategies for
suppressing the c-Src and STAT3 oncogenes of MMTVPyMT breast cancer may be of relevance in treating human
breast cancer (14).
Carbohydrate-restricted ketogenic diets, enriched in fat at
the expense of carbohydrates, have been repeatedly reported
to suppress breast cancer (15, 16). Tumor suppression by

ketogenic diets has been ascribed to limiting insulin and
IGF1 acting as growth factors (reviewed in ref. 17), and to the
obligatory requirement of malignant cells for glucosederived metabolites (e.g., nucleotides, NADPH) for supplying
their biomass demands (Warburg effect, reviewed in ref. 18).
Indeed, breast cancer is promoted by insulin resistance/
hyperinsulinemia, and insulin sensitizers used for treating
type 2 diabetes (e.g., metformin) appear to be effective in
suppressing tumorigenesis in general and breast cancer in
particular (19). Alternatively, the efﬁcacy of ketogenic diets
in suppressing tumorigenesis may further be ascribed to the
inherent efﬁcacy of free/nonesteriﬁed long-chain fatty acids
(LCFA), if allowed to reach high enough intracellular concentrations. Carbohydrate restriction may indeed allow for
that, by limiting the availability of glycerol-3-phosphate and
insulin required for the esteriﬁcation of LCFA into downstream lipid products (20).
The putative inherent efﬁcacy of nonesteriﬁed LCFA to
suppress transformation may be simulated by MEDICA
analogues. MEDICA analogues (21) consist of long-chain,
a,w–dioic acids [HOOC–C(a0 )–C(b0 )–Q–C(b)–C(a)–COOH,
where Q represents a long-chain core element], substituted
in the aa0 (Maa), bb0 (Mbb), and/or other optional core
carbons. MEDICA analogues may be thioesteriﬁed to their
respective CoA-thioesters, but these are not esteriﬁed into
lipids, nor converted into ceramides, whereas the substitutions at the aa0 or bb0 positions block their b-oxidation.
MEDICA analogues are mostly excreted in bile as respective
glucuronides. As such, MEDICA analogues may mimic allosteric activities of free/nonesteriﬁed LCFA, while avoiding
their role as substrates for b-oxidation or esteriﬁcation into
lipids. Moreover, MEDICA analogues proved antidiabetic
hypolipidemic efﬁcacy in a series of obese diabetic animal
models (22–24, 26), prompting our interest in studying the
efﬁcacy of ketogenic diet and MEDICA in the breast cancer
context.

Materials and Methods
Animals and diets
FVB wild-type females (Harlan Inc.) were bred in-house with
FVB MMTV-PyMT heterozygous males (Dr. Itay Ben-Porat,
Hebrew University Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel). F1-generation females were genotyped by PCR using the PyMT
primers: Fw: 50 GGAAAGTCACTAGGAGC-AGGG 30 ; Rev: 50
GGAAGCAAGTACTTCACAAGGG 30 . Mice were kept in standard SPF conditions in 12 hours light/dark periods, with free
access to food and water. Mice were fed with Teklad 2018S
standard rodent diet (54% carbohydrate, 18% fat, and 24%
protein energy), or with Teklad 93075 high-fat diet (HFD; 24%
carbohydrate, 54.8% fat, and 21.2% protein energy), or with
Teklad 96355 ketogenic diet (0.4% carbohydrate, 90.5% fat, and
9.1% protein energy). Teklad 96355 diet was freshly prepared as
gelatin chips every 3 days. The MEDICA diet consisted of 0.04%
(w/w) MEDICA [HOOC–C(CH3)2–(CH2)12–C(CH3)2–COOH]
mixed in Teklad 2018S standard rodent diet (yielding a dose
of 40 mg MEDICA/kg body weight/day). Energy intake was
determined by measuring food consumption every 3 days. Two
hours before sacriﬁce, mice were injected with bromodeox-

yuridine (BrdUrd) i.p where indicated. Upon sacriﬁce, mice
were anesthetized using 85% ketamine/15% xylazine (0.1 ml
per 25–30 g body weight). Breast tumors and lungs were
sampled in buffered 4% formaldehyde for further histochemistry/immunohistochemistry analysis, or in liquid nitrogen for
RNA and protein analysis. Animal care and experimental
procedures were in accordance with the accredited animal
ethics committee of the Hebrew University Medical School.
Immunohistochemistry
Mammary tumor specimens ﬁxed in 4% buffered formaldehyde were embedded in parafﬁn. Sections (5 mm) were
dewaxed and rehydrated through graded ethanol dilutions,
followed by cooking in 25 mmol/L citrate buffer, pH 7.4, at
115 C for 3 minutes. Endogenous peroxidase activity was
blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Sections were then incubated with the primary antibodies as indicated, followed by
incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or ﬂuorescentconjugated secondary antibodies (The Jackson Laboratory).
HRP-incubated sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Fluorescent intensity was analyzed by confocal microscopy
using DAPI for nuclei visualization (Zeiss LSM 710; Axio
observer Z1). Lungs were excised and ﬁxed in formalin overnight and then parafﬁn-embedded. Sections (5 mm) were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and analyzed using
computerized microscopy (Ariol SL-50; Olympus BX61 Applied
Imaging).
Cell cultures
MMTV-PyMT primary cells were isolated from 16-week-old
MMTV-PyMT mice as described previously (25). Met-1 cells
(Dr. Alexander Borowsky, Center for Comparative Medicine,
University of California, Davis, Davis, CA) and primary cells
were cultured in complete DMEM (Biological Industries) supplemented with penicillin–streptomycin solution, L-glutamine,
and 10% FCS, followed by adding MEDICA as indicated. Cell
proliferation was quantiﬁed using the Methylene Blue assay.
Met-1 cells cultured in 24 plate were transfected with M67TATA-TK-LUC (1 mg) reporter plasmid, expression plasmids
for constitutive STAT3 (0.1 mg), and for CMV–b-galactosidase
(0.1 mg), using jetPEI DNA transfection reagent (26). Following
8 hours, medium was changed and cells were treated for 24
hours with MEDICA as indicated. Luciferase activity normalized to b-galactosidase was measured as previously described
(26). HCC1954 cells (ATCC CRL-2338) were cultured in RPMI1640 (Biological Industries) supplemented with penicillin–
streptomycin solution and 10% FCS, and added MEDICA as
indicated. Where indicated, HCC1954 cells were infected with
lentivirus knockout constructs of sh-c-Src, sh-STAT3, or
scramble plasmids (Sigma Mission), followed by puromycin
selection.
Clonogenic assay
Cells of respective experimental plates were trypsinized. A
total of 7,500 cells were plated on 60-mm plate and allowed to
form colonies for 10 days. Cells were ﬁxed with 0.625% gluteraldehyde and stained with methylene blue. Colonies exceeding
400 mm in size were counted.

Suppression of Breast Cancer by Fatty Acid Analogue

Cell lysis and Western blotting
Cultured cells were scraped with 1X lysis buffer (50
mmol/L Tris HCl pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/L EGTA,
1 mmol/L EDTA, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L NaPPi,
50 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L PMSF, 1 mmol/L Na Vanadate,
40 nmol/L bpVfan and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma),
and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 12,500 rpm. Frozen tumor
samples were homogenized in lysis buffer using Polytron
homogenizer. Protein concentration was determined by BCA
(Thermo Scientiﬁc). Unless otherwise indicated, protein
lysates were prepared in SDS sample buffer [62 mmol/L
Tris (pH 6.8), 2.3% SDS, 0.64 mmol/L mercaptoethanol,
10% glycerol], subjected to SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred
onto cellulose nitrate membranes (Schleicher & Schuell)
and probed with the indicated ﬁrst antibody, followed by
HRP-labeled second antibody. Where indicated, protein
lysates were prepared in SDS sample buffer lacking mercaptoethanol. Bands were detected by ECL, and the intensity of
individual bands was determined by densitometry using
TINA 2.10 software.
Immunoprecipitation
MET-1 cells were incubated as indicated. Following incubation, cells were rinsed once in cold PBS and lysed with 50
mmol/L Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5

b-glycerolphosphate, 25 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L Na-vanadate, 40 nmol/L bpVphen, protease inhibitor mix (Sigma),
and 17.5 mg/mL Octyl beta-D-glucopyranoside (Sigma).
Lysates were kept on ice for 30 minutes and centrifuged at
12,000 rpm for 15 minutes. Lysate of 250 mg was incubated for
4 hours with protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
preloaded with the indicated antibody . The immunoprecipitate was rinsed three times with washing buffer [20 mmol/L
Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1%Tx-100, 10% glycerol],
suspended in SDS sample buffer and boiled for 8 minutes.
Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/
Western blotting.
qRT-PCR
RNA was puriﬁed from frozen mouse tissues using the
Total RNA Mini Kit (Geneaid). RNA of 0.5 mg was used as
template for cDNA synthesis using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) . Real-time PCR was carried out (Rotorgene,
Corbett Research) using KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR MIX (Kapa
Biosystems) with the following primers (50 to 30 ): MMP9
(Fw: AACCTCCAACCTCACGGACAC, Rev: CTGCT-TCTCTCCCATCATCTGG); E-cadherin (Fw: TCATCATTGAGAGGGAGACAGGCT, Rev: TGGGTAAACTCTGGCCTGTTGTCA); Ezh2
(Fw: GACGATGATGGAGATGA-TCCAGATG, Rev: CCGAGGTGGGCAAGTTTCTTTATC); PyMT (Fw: CTCCAACAGATCACCCGCACATACT, Rev: GCTGGTCTTGGTCGCTTTCTGGA-TAC). mRNA was quantiﬁed using the DDCt method (27).
ELISA
VEGF content of mouse lysates was determined using the
Quantikine Mouse VEGF Kit (R&D System) according to the
manufacturer's instructions.

ROS production
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was determined
by 2,7 dichloroﬂuoresceine diacetate (DCF; 5 mmol/L) added
to respective cell cultures for the last 15 minutes of incubation. Cells were washed once with PBS, and lysed with 0.5%
TX-100. DCF ﬂuorescence was determined by 485/530 nm
excitation/emission analysis. Hydrogen peroxide production
was determined by incubating respective growth media
(phenol red-free) with HRP/Amplex Red (Invitrogen). Fluorescence was determined by 560/590-nm excitation/emission
analysis. The glutathione/glutathione disulﬁde (GSH/GSSG)
ratio was determined by the GSH/GSSG-Glo assay (Promega)
according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Results
Suppression of MMTV-PyMT tumor growth by
carbohydrate restriction
Suppression of MMTV-PyMT tumorigenesis by ketogenic
diet has been veriﬁed in transgenic FVB MMTV-PyMT mice fed
throughout weeks 4 to 12 with either standard, high-fat or
ketogenic diet, consisting of 3.2, 0.4, and 0.004 carbohydrate/fat
energy ratios, respectively. Tumor mass decreased by 65%
upon increasing dietary fat energy at the expense of dietary
carbohydrate (Fig. 1A), with increase in tumor latency (not
shown). Suppression of tumor mass by ketogenic diet was
accompanied by decrease in BrdUrd staining (Fig. 1B). The
extent of decrease in tumor mass by ketogenic diet was
essentially similar to that of MEDICA dosed with standard
carbohydrate-rich diet (Fig. 1A).
Suppression of MMTV-PyMT tumorigenesis by ketogenic
diet was not accounted for by caloric restriction that may
accompany use of ketogenic diets (15). Indeed, daily energy
consumption amounted to 9.3, 10.2, 16.0, and 14.1 kcal/mouse
for the standard, high-fat, ketogenic diet, and MEDICA feed,
respectively. The 150% to 170% increase in ketogenic energy
consumption did not result in any signiﬁcant change in body
weight gain (23.4  2.3, 22.5  1.3, and 23.5  2.4 g for 12 weeks
control, ketogenic and MEDICA mice, respectively). In the
absence of visible diarrhea or steatorrhea, the increase in

energy consumption may imply an increase in total body
energy turnover of MMTV-PyMT mice maintained on ketogenic diet or MEDICA feed.
Suppression of MMTV-PyMT tumorigenesis by MEDICA
MEDICA treatment of transgenic FVB MMTV-PyMT
female mice throughout weeks 4 to 12 or weeks 4 to 18
(denoted by 4/12 and 4/18, respectively) resulted in 75%
decrease in tumor mass as compared with control mice (Fig.
2A). Suppression of tumor growth was also reﬂected in
longer tumor latency in MEDICA-treated mice, in which
palpable tumors of MEDICA-treated mice were delayed by 2
weeks as compared with control mice (10 and 8 weeks,
respectively). Moreover, MEDICA treatment throughout
weeks 12 to 18 (denoted by 12/18) resulted in robust
decrease in tumor mass (Fig. 2A), implying growth suppression of established MMTV-PyMT tumors.
Nontreated tumors consisted of highly dense poorly differentiated mammary carcinoma, whereas MEDICA-treated
tumors consisted of areas of papillary glandular structures,
with occasional cysts lined by squamous epithelium and ﬁlled
with ﬂuid containing casein (Figs. 2B and C), implying more
differentiated morphologic pattern.
Most importantly, MEDICA treatment resulted in robust
decrease in lung metastases (Fig. 2D). Thus, the number of lung
metastatic foci, and in particular the percentage of lung area
occupied by lung metastases, were signiﬁcantly decreased by
MEDICA (12/18) treatment (5.9% vs. 0.4% lung area in nontreated and MEDICA-treated mice, respectively), implying
growth inhibition of established lung metastatic foci.
Suppression of MMTV-PyMT tumor growth by MEDICA was
not accounted for by loss of the PyMT transgene, or by
interfering with the overall hormonal balance of treated mice.
Thus, PyMT expression remained unaffected by MEDICA
treatment, and MEDICA-treated female mice were fertile (not
shown).
Suppression of MMTV-PyMT tumor growth by MEDICA was
further evaluated in terms of proliferation, apoptosis, and

6994

Cancer Res; 74(23) December 1, 2014

angiogenesis. MEDICA treatment resulted in pronounced
decrease in BrdUrd incorporation, being sparse and mainly
evident at the periphery of tumor lesions (Fig. 3A). In line with
decreased BrdUrd incorporation, MEDICA treatment resulted
in 75% decrease in the tumor mitotic index veriﬁed by p-HH3
staining (Fig. 3B). Inhibition of proliferation by MEDICA was
accompanied by increase in apoptosis, veriﬁed by cleaved
caspase-3 staining (Fig. 3C). Increased apoptosis was mainly
evident in tumor samples of MEDICA (4/18), whereas
decreased proliferation was mostly pronounced in tumor
samples of MEDICA (4/12). Suppression of MMTV-PyMT
tumor growth by MEDICA was further accompanied by
decrease in tumor vascularization as veriﬁed by decrease in
the CD34 endothelial marker (Fig. 3D) and tumor VEGF
content (Fig. 3E).

MMTV-PyMT mesenchymal–epithelial transition in
response to MEDICA
The higher epithelial differentiation pattern induced by
MEDICA, combined with inhibition of MMTV-PyMT metastasis, was further evaluated by verifying epithelial–mesenchymal biomarkers in response to MEDICA (Fig. 4). MEDICA
treatment resulted in increase in E-cadherin expression (Fig.
4A), being accompanied by increase in membranous b-catenin
(Fig. 4B), with pronounced decrease in MMP9 expression (Fig.
4C). MEDICA-induced expression of E-cadherin combined
with suppression of MMP9 expression was further evaluated
in terms of transcription factors that may control mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET). Ezh2 (polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2) is the histone methyltransferase catalytic subunit of the polycomb-repressive complex 2,
being overexpressed in a variety of aggressive breast cancers
(28, 29). Ezh2 is associated with genome instability, disruption
of mammary ductal morphogenesis (30), and invasion and
metastasis of malignant breast cancer, being partly accounted
for by suppression of E-cadherin and induction of MMPs
expression (31, 32). Ezh2 transcript, protein, and cell content

were suppressed by MEDICA (Fig. 4D), pointing to mammary
epithelial transition of MEDICA-treated MMTV-PyMT tumors.
Suppression of PyMT c-Src and STAT3 oncogenic drivers
by MEDICA
Suppression of the MMTV-PyMT oncogenic drivers by
MEDICA was evaluated in Met-1 (33) and primary MMTVPyMT cells. MEDICA inhibited the proliferation of primary
MMTV-PyMT and of Met-1 cells (Fig. 5A). The mmol/L concentrations of MEDICA reﬂect the high binding afﬁnity of
MEDICA analogues to serum albumin [higher than 99%, independently of MEDICA concentrations in the range of 0–0.9
mmol/L (not shown)], resulting in nmol/L concentrations of
the free MEDICA acid in the culture medium.
The roles played by the c-Src and STAT3 transduction
pathways in PyMT cell survival were veriﬁed in Met-1 cells.
In line with the transforming role played by c-Src/PyMT, cell
growth was inhibited by the c-Src kinase inhibitor dasatinib
(Supplementary Fig. S1A; ref. 34). However, cell growth was

www.aacrjournals.org

only partially suppressed by dasatinib under saturating dasatinib concentrations, whereby phospho–c-Src(Tyr416) was
90% inhibited, implying the activity of additional oncogenic
driver(s). Indeed, Met-1 cell growth was inhibited by the JAK/
STAT3(Tyr705) inhibitor pyridine 6 (P6) (Supplementary Fig.
S1B; ref. 13), indicating that STAT3 serves as oncogenic driver
for PyMT cell survival. However, here again suppression of
Met-1 cell growth by P6 was only partial, whereby phosphoSTAT3(Tyr705) was essentially abrogated, implying that Met-1
survival is driven by each of the c-Src and STAT3 oncogenes.
Moreover, phospho-STAT3(Tyr705) of Met-1 cells was only
marginally (<20%) inhibited by the c-Src inhibitor dasatinib
(not shown), whereas phospho–c-Src(Tyr416) was not affected
by the JAK inhibitor P6, indicating that the c-Src and STAT3
transduction pathways act as independent oncogenic drivers.
In line with that, inhibition of Met-1 cell growth by combining
dasatinib and P6 was additive (Supplementary Fig. S1C),
implying that Met-1 survival is independently driven by both,
c-Src and STAT3.

10 ﬁelds per mouse using computerized microscopy;  , signiﬁcant as compared with control (P < 0.05). E, VEGF content of MMTV-PyMT tumors
of control and MEDICA-treated mice. VEGF content was determined by ELISA in tumor lysates of control, MEDICA (4/12)-, and MEDICA (4/18)-treated
mice. VEGF content of 12-week control is deﬁned as 1.0 mean  SE (n ¼ 8);  , signiﬁcant as compared with the respective control (P < 0.001).

In line with our previous ﬁndings in other cell types (26),
MEDICA treatment resulted in suppressing STAT3(Tyr705)
and Akt(Ser473) phosphorylation in primary MMTV-PyMT
cells, and in suppressing the transcriptional activity of STAT3
in Met-1 cells (Fig. 5B), indicating that suppression of PyMT
survival by MEDICA may partly be ascribed to inhibition of the
STAT3 transduction pathway. MEDICA efﬁcacy in suppressing
c-Src/PyMT was pursued by analyzing the c-Src content in
PyMT immunoprecipitates of Met-1 cells. MEDICA treatment
resulted in abrogating c-Src association with PyMT (Fig. 5C),
implying suppression of c-Src–induced PyMT transduction.
MEDICA apparent efﬁcacy in inducing a conformational
change in c-Src was further indicated by probing c-Src sensitivity to dasatinib in the absence and presence of added
MEDICA. Indeed, dasatinib concentrations that were only
partly effective in inhibiting phspho-Src(Tyr416), became fully
effective by added MEDICA, implying an apparent MEDICAinduced increase in c-Src afﬁnity for dasatinib (Fig. 5D).
MEDICA-induced increase in c-Src afﬁnity for dasatinib was

6996

Cancer Res; 74(23) December 1, 2014

further veriﬁed by the combined effect of MEDICA and dasatinib in suppressing Met-1 cell growth, under conditions of
short incubation time (24 hours), whereby MEDICA standalone was essentially ineffective in suppressing cell growth.
Added MEDICA resulted in synergizing dasatinib activity in
suppressing Met-1 cell growth by dasatinib concentrations
that were only partially effective in the absence of MEDICA
(Fig. 5E). That is in contrast with P6, in which its combination
with dasatinib was strictly additive (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
The mode of action of MEDICA in suppressing c-Src–transforming activity has been further studied in human HCC1954
breast cancer cells (overexpressing ErbB2, ER-, and PRnegative).

molecular weight adducts, with concomitant decrease in the cSrc monomers, exempliﬁed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing
conditions (Fig. 6C). In line with that, and in apparent similarity to classical c-Src kinase inhibitors, MEDICA-induced cSrc oligomerization resulted in suppressing the phosphorylation of downstream substrates of c-Src, like FAK(Tyr925) or
p130CAS(Tyr410) (Fig. 6D). Surprisingly, however, decrease in
c-Src monomers and its activity by MEDICA treatment was
accompanied by MEDICA-induced increase in Tyr416 phosphorylation of c-Src monomers and oligomers (Figs. 6E),
implying that c-Src conformational change induced by MEDICA may account for its inactivation, while paradoxically
increasing its Tyr416 phosphorylation.
Cysteine oxidation of c-Src by ROS (e.g., O2, H2O2) has
recently been reported to result in c-Src homodimerization
(35) and in autophosphorylating its Tyr416 (36, 37), while

6998

activating (36) or inhibiting (35, 38) its kinase activity. Indeed,
MEDICA treatment of HCC1954 cells resulted in increase in
ROS production and H2O2 release into the culture medium,
with concomitant decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio (Fig. 6F).
ROS production by MEDICA was similarly observed in Met-1
cells, being abrogated by added N-acetyl cysteine (NAC; not
shown). MEDICA-induced c-Src oligomerization and c-Src
(Tyr416) autophosphorylation were all abrogated by added
NAC (Fig. 6G), implying that c-Src oxidation by MEDICAinduced ROS may account for suppressing its activity in the
breast cancer context. Also, suppression of HCC1954 clonogenity by MEDICA was partly abrogated by added PEG–SOD
(Fig. 6H), implying that MEDICA-induced ROS may partly
account for growth inhibition of breast cancer cells. Moreover,
ketogenic diets were reported to sensitize lung cancer cells to
radiation-induced cell killing by a mechanism that appeared to

Discussion
Seventy percent of human breast cancers express active cSrc, whereas 50% express constitutive STAT3 (12, 13). Furthermore, c-Src is reported to be a common oncogenic driver of
variable trastuzumab resistance pathways, implying that suppressing its activity may overcome resistance (40). Similarly,
STAT3 plays an essential role in breast cancer stem cells, being
correlated with tamoxifen resistance (41). Hence, treatment
strategies for suppressing the c-Src/STAT3 interplay are of
relevance in treating human breast cancer (14).
c-Src plays an obligatory role in inducing breast cancer in
MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice, in which membranous PyMT
phosphorylation by c-Src results in cell proliferation and
survival (42). Hence, the c-Src/PyMT complex may be visualized as oncogenic human RTK, with c-Src acting as its obligatory tyrosine kinase. Concomitantly, PyMT cell survival is
promoted by constitutive STAT3 (5). Similarly to the MMTVPyMT model, survival of human HCC1954 breast cancer cells is
shown here to be driven by both, c-Src and STAT3. Of note, the
c-Src and STAT3 oncogenic drivers are shown here to act
independently in promoting MMTV-PyMT as well as HCC1954
cell survival, underscoring the need for abrogating both to
suppress breast cancer.
Suppression of MMTV-PyMT and HCC1954 cell survival by
MEDICA is shown here to be partly accounted for by suppressing the STAT3 transduction pathway, in line with our previous
reports in other cell types (26). Suppression of STAT3 in
MMTV-PyMT and HCC1954 cells by MEDICA is reﬂected by
decrease in phospho-STAT3(Tyr705) and in STAT3 transcriptional activity. Suppression of cell survival by MEDICA is
further due to MEDICA-induced ROS production, resulting in
inactive c-Src that fails to activate its downstream substrates
(35, 38). Thus, MEDICA treatment is shown here to abrogate cSrc association with its PyMT scaffold, as well as to suppress
the phosphorylation of c-Src downstream substrates like FAK
(Ser925) and p130CAS(Tyr410) in HCC1954 cells. That is
despite enhancing c-Src(Tyr416) autophosphorylation, implying a mode of inhibition of c-Src–transforming activity that
differs from that of classical c-Src kinase inhibitors (e.g.,
dasatinib, saracatinib, bosutinib; ref. 43).
c-Src oxidation has been reported to result in its heterodimerization and inactivation (35), whereas others have
reported increase in c-Src Tyr416 phosphorylation, resulting
in enhancing its kinase activity, tumorigenesis, and metastasis
(36, 37, 44). Increase in c-Src(Tyr416) autophosphorylation and
enhanced kinase activity has been ascribed to c-Src oxidation
that results in a covalent S–S bond between its SH2 Cys245 and
Cys487 of its kinase domain (37). In contrast, oxidation of
Cys277 in c-Src GQGCFG glycine loop is reported to result in cSrc oligomerization and loss of c-Src activity (35), due presumably to decrease in c-Src afﬁnity for its downstream
substrates. Of note, oxidation of c-Src by MEDICA-induced
ROS is shown here to result in abrogating c-Src kinase and
transforming activity, while concomitantly increasing its
Tyr416 phosphorylation, implying that the two oxidative
modes of modulating c-Src activity are not mutually exclusive.
Indeed, concomitant c-Src oxidation by the two oxidative

7000

Cancer Res; 74(23) December 1, 2014

modes may result in inactive c-Src oligomers having an "open"
conformation with increase in c-Src(Tyr416) autophosphorylation (Figs. 6D and G).
Suppression of MMTV-PyMT tumor by MEDICA resulted in
suppressing tumor mass, proliferation, mitotic index, and
angiogenesis, while promoting tumor apoptosis. Most importantly, suppression of tumor survival was accompanied by
increase in breast markers of differentiation, as evident by
tumors consisting of papillary glandular structures, with cysts
lined by squamous epithelium ﬁlled with ﬂuid containing
casein. Similar differentiation proﬁle has previously been
reported in MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice treated with the
c-Src kinase inhibitor bosutinib (SKI606; ref. 45) as well as in cSrc–null mice (42), implying that inhibiting c-Src activity by
kinase inhibitors, genetically, or by its oxidation may converge
onto a similar phenotype.
Suppression of MMTV-PyMT tumor growth by MEDICA is
further shown here to be accompanied by suppressing lung
metastasis. Suppression of lung metastasis may be ascribed to
suppressing the primary tumor, resulting in decreased probability for tumor dissemination, complemented by inhibiting
epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) of tumor cells.
Indeed, MEDICA treatment was found to induce the enrichment of tumor cells with membranous E-cadherin and b-catenin, accompanied by decrease in MMP9 transcript. Because
both, STAT3 and c-Src are potent inducers of EMT (46, 47),
tumor cell epithelialization by MEDICA may partly be ascribed
to abrogating EMT. EMT suppression by MEDICA may further
be partly accounted for by suppressing Ezh2 transcription.
Because Ezh2 is involved in controlling cell proliferation,
differentiation, and apoptosis (31, 32), its suppression by
MEDICA may further account for suppressing tumor growth
while promoting tumor differentiation.
Suppression of MMTV-PyMT tumor growth by MEDICA
apparently simulates that of ketogenic diet, indicating that
the efﬁcacy of carbohydrate-restricted/ketogenic diets in
suppressing tumorigenesis may perhaps reﬂect the inherent
tumor-suppressive efﬁcacy of free LCFA or their respective
CoA-thioesters, if allowed to reach high enough intracellular
concentrations, by suppressing their esteriﬁcation into
lipids due to limiting insulin and glycerol-3-phosphate. The
apparent similar phenotypes induced by MEDICA treatment
and ketogenic diets may indicate that both may converge to
the same target(s). Indeed, the induced increase in total
body energy turnover by the two concerned effectors may
perhaps point to mitochondria being the target of both
effectors. Indeed, LCFA as well as MEDICA compounds have
been previously reported to induce low-conductance gating
of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP;
refs. 48, 49). PTP gating results in robust increase in oxygen
consumption due to decrease in inner mitochondrial membrane potential, and in increase in mitochondrial ROS
production due to loss of mitochondrial reductive components (50). Because the compliance to ketogenic diets is
quite poor, MEDICA treatment may offer the beneﬁt of
simulating carbohydrate restriction while maintaining a
balanced diet.
