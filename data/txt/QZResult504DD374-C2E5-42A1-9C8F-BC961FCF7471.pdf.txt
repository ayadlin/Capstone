BACKGROUND. Expenditures related to the use of medical androgen deprivation
led in part to the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) in 2003. This mandated a
decline in reimbursement to 80% to 85% of the average wholesale price starting
in 2004 followed by a more significant reduction in 2005 to 106% of the average
sales price, which effectively reduced the reimbursement by approximately 50%
of 2003 values. The authors hypothesized that these changes in reimbursement
may affect the way practitioners administer these treatments.

METHODS. The publicly available dataset Medicare Part B Extract Summary System was examined from 2001 to 2005 for trends in the number of allowed services and dollar amounts of allowed charges and payments. The reimbursable
Medicare codes of J9217 (leuprolide acetate), J9202 (goserelin acetate), J9219 (leuprolide acetate implant), and J3315 (triptorelin pamoate) were examined for
medical castration. The code for simple orchiectomy, 54520, was used for surgical
castration.

RESULTS. The use of medical castration increased from 2001 to 2003, whereas,
over the same period, surgical castration decreased. Total allowed charges for
medical castration peaked in 2003 at $1.23 billion. After the enactment of
the MMA, surgical castration rates increased, and medical castration decreased.
Total allowed charges for medical castration in 2005 dropped 65% from the
2003 peak.

CONCLUSIONS. The use of medical androgen ablation decreased significantly with
the decrease in reimbursement. The administration of either surgical or medical
castration in the U.S. Medicare population appears to be tied closely to reimbursement in trend, but not always in magnitude. Cancer 2008;112:2195–201.  2008

T

he role of androgen deprivation in prostate cancer treatment
has been important for more than 60 years since Huggins and
Hodges described the effect of castration on metastatic prostate
cancer.1 The 2 primary forms of androgen deprivation for prostate
cancer used today are medical castration with lutenizing hormonereleasing hormone (LHRH) agonists and surgical castration (orchiectomy). It has been demonstrated that these treatments are
equally efficacious.2–5 Given the physiologic equality of these 2 treatments, other factors, such as quality of life and costs, tend to dominate treatment decisions.
During the late 1990s and into the early 2000s, the use of LHRH
agonists for the treatment of prostate cancer increased dramatically,

whereas, during this same period, the use of orchiectomy (surgical androgen ablation), decreased in
the U.S. Medicare population.6 These trends were
observed despite the evidence that both surgical and
medical androgen ablation are equally effective as
anticancer therapies.4,5,7 Moreover, other studies suggest that both forms of castration have similar effects
on health-related quality of life (HRQOL).8–10
This trend may be explained in part by patient
preference. Surveys of men with stage D prostate
cancer demonstrated that nearly 80% of men would
choose medical castration over surgical castration.11
However, increases in the use of LHRH agonists were
noted across all stages of disease, across all histologic
grades, and in older patients (aged 80 years),6 raising the question of whether other factors were influencing medical decisions.
Conservative cost analysis studies indicate that,
for the average patient, medical castration is from 10
to 20 times more expensive than surgical androgen
ablation.12–14 By using pre-Medicare Modernization
Act (MMA) reimbursement rates, medical androgen
ablation only surpasses surgical castration in cost
effectiveness when life expectancy is from 2
months to 5 months. Bayoumi et al. concluded that,
for men who would accept it, orchiectomy was the
most cost effective method of androgen blockade
($7500 per quality-adjusted life years).15 It is interesting to note that surgical orchiectomy costs are
1-time occurrences and eliminate future costs of
androgen ablation for the remainder of the patient’s
lifetime. In summary, despite physiologic equivalence
of surgical and medical castration, similar HRQOL
outcomes, and evidence that medical castration is
much more expensive, 1 treatment modality (LHRH
agonist therapy) has become the predominant
method of androgen ablation for prostate cancer.
Several explanations have been advanced for this
trend of increasing medical castration, including financial incentives,6 pressure to ‘‘do something’’ in
light of a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence,16–18 patient preference,11,13 desire to have a
reversible treatment option13 (slightly more men
express regret after surgical castration compared
with medical castration),19 and lack of strong data
lending to a consensus protocol.
The rising use of LHRH agonists led to increased
Medicare expenditures for these drugs, which topped
$1 billion in 2001. These exorbitant costs came
under scrutiny and led in part to the MMA in 2003.
The MMA was instituted in 2004 with a reduction in
the reimbursement of the average wholesale price
(AWP) (from 95% to 80%–85%). Then in 2005, reimbursement decreased to effectively 40% to 50% of

the 2003 AWP. The actual calculation was 106% of
the average sales price). We hypothesize that these
changes in reimbursement may change the way
practitioners administer both medical and surgical
castration.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The publicly available dataset, Medicare Part B
Extract Summary System (BESS), was examined from
2001 to 2005 for trends in the number of allowed services and dollar amounts of allowed charges and
payments. The BESS dataset includes all allowable
Medicare services in the U.S. with the accompanying
allowed charge and allowed payment. The dates were
chosen because they would bracket the timeframe of
the institution of the MMA and reflect the most
recent data available.
The reimbursable Medicare codes of J9217 (leuprolide acetate; Lupron, Eligard), J9202 (goserelin acetate; Zoladex), J9219 (leuprolide acetate implant;
Viadur), and J3315 (triptorelin pamoate; Trelstar)
were examined for medical castration. Triptorelin
pamoate injections were reimbursed under the code
J3315 beginning in 2003. Abarelix injectable solution
(Plenaxis) was the first Food and Drug Administration-approved gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist. It became available for Medicare
reimbursement in March 2005 and was given the
code J0128.
The medication histrelin acetate (Vantas) was
excluded from analysis, because it is reimbursed
under the code for ‘‘unclassified drugs,’’ J3490. This
code includes several other medications and, to our
knowledge, data regarding the use of histrelin acetate
cannot be extracted from the other drugs that also
are coded J3490. We contacted Indevus Pharmaceuticals, the makers of histrelin acetate, and asked them
to provide this information for our study. They
declined to provide information on the amount of
their product’s use; however, to our knowledge, it has
gained limited acceptance in the U.S. market and
would have little impact on our findings.
Surgical ablation rates and reimbursement data
were derived from the Current Procedural Terminology code for simple orchiectomy: 54520. The other
surgical orchiectomy codes were excluded because
they would not apply to surgical castration, including
54522 (partial orchiectomy), 54530 (radical inguinal
orchiectomy for tumor), 54535 (radical orchiectomy
for tumor with abdominal exploration), and 54690
(laparoscopic orchiectomy, likely for undescended
testicle). The data were analyzed by using commercially available software.

castration increased by 7%, and the number of orchiectomies performed increased by 4.2%. Total expenditures for combined medical and surgical castration
decreased 63% from $1.2 billion in 2003 to $450 million in 2005. The increases in surgical castration services did not proportionately offset the decrease in
medical castration, and the net effect was an overall
decrease in androgen-ablative services delivered in
the U.S. Medicare population.

DISCUSSION
FIGURE 1. The total number of services and average Medicare reimbursement for all lutenizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists in the U.S. Medicare population (codes for leuprolide acetate injection [J9217], leuprolide
acetate implant [J9219], goserelin acetate [J9202], and triptorelin pamoate
[J3315]).

RESULTS
A common trend of increasing use of LHRH agonists
as an aggregate was observed nationwide from 2001
to 2003 (Fig. 1). From 2004 to 2005, there was a trend
toward the decreasing use of LHRH agonists. This
pattern of increasing use of LHRH agonists and then
a sharp decrease from 2004 to 2005 also largely was
observed for each individual code (Fig. 2a–d). The 1
exception was noted with triptorelin pamoate (Fig.
2d), for which the number of treatments rose in the
U.S. Medicare population from 2004 to 2005. Abarelix
injectable solution, coded J0128, was reimbursed first
in 2005. During that year, 19,625 services were
allowed for code J0128. This accounts for <1% of the
2.1 million total allowed services for medical castration. An opposite pattern was noted in the case of
surgical androgen ablation. The rates of orchiectomy
decreased from 2001 to 2004 and then began to
increase from 2004 to 2005 (Fig. 3).
The sum of total payments for surgeons’ fees in
2003 for surgical castration amounted to $1,578,009,
which represents 0.16% of the total amount paid by
Medicare for both medical and surgical castration
combined. By comparison, medical castration in
2003 tallied a total of $973,243,241 in payments. Average Medicare payments represent approximately
80% of the allowed reimbursed cost, so the total
amount spent on LHRH agonists in 2003 was $1.2
billion. After enactment of the MMA, in the year
2005, the U.S. government reduced the number of
dollars it paid by $619,754,914 on these 4 agents
compared with the peak sum in 2003. This represents a 64% decrease in payment, whereas the
decrease in allowed services was only 14%. During
this same period, the average payment for surgical

The data from the current study demonstrate the
increased use of LHRH agonists over the years from
2001 to 2003 and a sudden decrease in years 2004
and 2005, with the opposite but less acute pattern
witnessed in surgical castration. Possible explanations for these trends include 1) a change in prostate
cancer disease demographics (ie, stage migration toward less aggressive disease requiring less need for
systemic agents); 2) a trend toward using longer acting (6-month to 12-month release) antiandrogen
agents in place of 3-month or 4-month preparations,
causing a pseudoreduction in overall use; 3) changes
in perception on the relative effectiveness of surgical
versus medical castration; 4) evidence in the literature supporting the decreased or intermittent use of
LHRH agonists; 5) reimbursement changes leading to
changes in use; 6) the decreased use of neoadjunctive LHRH agents with radiotherapy, brachytherapy,
or cryotherapy; or 7) a combination of these factors.
We believe that many of these explanations are
unlikely to contribute significantly to our understanding of the observed trend. First, to our knowledge, there has been no demonstration of a trend
toward the diagnosis of more aggressive prostate
cancers in the U.S. during the time frame in which
the use of LHRH agents surged. In fact, since the
introduction of PSA screening, many studies have
demonstrated a trend toward less aggressive cancer.20
Could this observed drop in LHRH use, beginning in
2004, be explained by the decrease in aggressive
cancers? It is unlikely given the finding that both
pathologic and clinical stage migration slowed substantially in the late 1990s21 and virtually was gone
by 2001.22 In addition, previous studies have demonstrated that this increase in LHRH use occurred
across all stages of disease and among elderly
patients, in whom the chance of any survival benefit
is minimal.6,17
It is difficult to determine whether there is a
trend toward longer acting agents, because data
regarding histrelin acetate were unavailable for interpretation, and both 3-month and 4-month leuprolide

acetate injections are reimbursed under the same
code. However, it is clear that the use of leuprolide
acetate implant decreased at a greater rate (27%)
than the use of leuprolide acetate injections (12%),
suggesting that practitioners simply are not using
LHRH agonists as often. It also does not appear that
practitioners merely switched to other antiandrogen
agents, such as abarelix, given the finding that it
accounted for <1% of the total expenditures by Medicare on medical castration in 2005.
Around the time this trend was observed, several
reports suggested that LHRH agonists were being

overused and that orchiectomy was being underused:
Those conclusions were based primarily on financial
analyses.6,12,14,15 Therefore, we performed a MEDLINE search for publications regarding this topic during the period to determine whether there was a
trend in publications supporting the use of LHRH
agonists over orchiectomy and, then, supporting
orchiectomy over medical castration. We searched
the controlled-vocabulary Medical Subject Heading
(MeSH) terms ‘‘gonadotropin-releasing hormone/
agonists’’ AND ‘‘orchiectomy’’ AND ‘‘prostatic neoplasms.’’ For the years 2001 through 2005 there were
6 articles, 5 articles, 12 articles, 11 articles, and 8 articles published, respectively, on this topic. Those articles were composed primarily of reviews, financial
analyses, and related publications that did not
directly address surgical versus medical ablation.
There was no pattern noted among these articles
that could explain such drastic changes in use beginning in 2004.
To search for publications addressing the adverse
effects of androgen ablation, we searched MEDLINE
for the MeSH terms (‘‘androgen antagonists’’ [MeSH]
AND ‘‘prostatic neoplasms’’ [MeSH]) AND adverse
effects. From 2001 through 2005, approximately 40 to
60 articles were published each year, and approximately 1 in 3 of those articles was a review. The

Androgen Ablation and Reimbursement/Weight et al.

most commonly cited side effect was loss of bone
mineral density. This is not a new finding: Maillefert
et al. reported this nearly 15 years ago.23 More
recently, the deleterious metabolic and cardiovascular side effects have been demonstrated with androgen ablation.24 Although there were intimations that
antiandrogens may cause increased cardiovascular
risk secondary to increased obesity/muscle loss, it
was not well established until 200624; thus, it cannot
contribute much to the observed trend. The better
penetration of knowledge of these deleterious effects
into the greater medical community may account in
part for the overall decrease in androgen ablation.
However, we are unaware of any literature that
demonstrates the side-effect profile from surgical
castration is better than that of medical castration
and therefore we do not believe that the improved
understanding of the side effects accounts for the
drastic decrease in medical castration while surgical
castration rose.
There also have been studies by the South European Uro-oncologic Group and others that have supported the intermittent use of LHRH agonists.25,26
These data could be used in support of medical castration, which offers a reversible option. This also
may account for some of the observed overall decline
in androgen ablation but does not explain the differences in trend between types of LHRH agonists. In
summary, we observed that there may be support in
the literature for the decreased or intermittent use of
androgen ablation. It would be encouraging if practice patterns advanced immediately when supported
by the literature, but it is our observation that such
immediate changes are uncommon in widespread
practice, even when they are supported by level-1
evidence.
In situations in which there are no financial
incentives (or disincentives) to prescribe a treatment,
practice patterns usually change slowly. For example,
in the case of perioperative b blockers being administered to patients with increased cardiovascular
risk, the lag between level-1 evidence27 and the
incorporation of their use into practice is measured
in decades.28 In the current study data, the change
occurred in the very same years as the reimbursement changes. It appears unlikely that a ‘‘better
understanding’’ of medical literature contributed
much to the observed trends over the past 5 years.
With regard to quality of life, the body image
concerns of surgical orchiectomy are undeniable.
However, to our knowledge there has been no published evidence that men have a worse quality of life
after orchiectomy compared the quality of life of
men on LHRH agonists. Although they compared

2199

nonrandomized groups, the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study demonstrated that most quality-of-life
measures were similar between the 2 groups. In fact,
those who received LHRH agonists were more likely
to assess their health as poor and were more worried
about their prostate cancer.10 Nevertheless, other
publications suggest that a majority of men prefer
LHRH agonists to orchiectomy.11 In fact, in a small
sample of men being treated with LHRH agonists for
metastatic prostate cancer, 50% stated that, in a hypothetical situation, they would be willing to pay
$386 per month ($4632 per year) to continue LHRH
agonists and avoid orchiectomy.13 It is interesting to
note that there was no emerging quality-of-life evidence in the time frame of these changes to support
the observed change in LHRH use.
The most plausible explanation of the change in
practice is the change in reimbursement. It has been
estimated by some that the drastic reduction in
LHRH agonist reimbursement actually would cause
practicing physicians to lose money by administering
these medications after enactment of the MMA.29
Several details from the study data suggest that reimbursement is the strongest cause of the decreased
use of LHRH agonists in the U.S. The close temporal
relation of the reimbursement and services-delivered
curves suggests an association between the variables.
In fact, only 1 of the LHRH agonists increased in use
after institution of the MMA. Triptorelin pamoate
increased in use by 2786.2% (Fig. 2d). It is interesting
to note that this new agent also was the only LHRH
agonist to maintain its pre-MMA reimbursement rate
($288 per dose), which was approximately 80% to
95% more than the average reimbursement rate for
leuprolide acetate ($160 per dose) and goserelin acetate ($145 per dose). It is plausible that this newer
agent was undergoing an expected upsurge in use
given its recent introduction into the marketplace,
but financial incentive also may have played a role.
It also is interesting to note that the decline in use
of LHRH agents was not offset by a commensurate
surge in the use of surgical orchiectomy; therfore, the
overall impact of the observed changes was a total
decrease in the use of androgen ablation for the management of prostate cancer. The medical community
increasingly is becoming aware of the long-term side
effects of any type of androgen ablation, and this may
help explain why surgical castration rose but did not
surpass 2002 levels. For many patients, this decrease
may be appropriate based on the literature suggesting
a tendency to overprescribe androgen deprivation for
certain patients. However, there is some undefined
risk that patients who would benefit from androgen
deprivation may have that treatment withheld if

2200

CANCER

financial pressures inhibit use. We believe populations
especially likely to be at risk of under use are those
with moderate or high-risk disease that may benefit
from the neoadjuvant or adjuvant administration of
androgen deprivation with radiotherapy. In addition,
it is well recognized that some socioeconomic indicators predict populations at risk of under treatment
with a variety of health conditions, and this factor
well may become apparent in the current climate
regarding androgen ablation.
The current study is limited by its focus on a
population aged 65 years. The impact of such financial changes on patients who are not covered by
Medicare also cannot be assessed by these data.
Data are unavailable regarding cancer stage, sex,
PSA, and indication for treatment; although it
appears reasonable to conclude that the vast majority of the administration of LHRH agonists or bilateral simple orchiectomy is for prostate cancer. In the
Medicare population, the use of LHRH agents is
uncommon in postmenopausal women. The primary
indication for LHRH agonists in women is endometriosis and uterine fibroid tumors and is limited to
premenopausal women; therefore, this would have
minimal impact in our study population. A strength
of the current study is that it is comprised of data
from the entire U.S. Medicare population. Although
correlation does not prove causation, these data contain a clear trend, which suggests that financial pressures most likely contributed to prescription practice
of androgen ablation among practitioners in a U.S.
Medicare population.
The use of LHRH agonists decreased significantly with the decrease in reimbursement. The
administration of either surgical or medical castration in the U.S. Medicare population appears to be
tied very closely to reimbursement in trend, but
not always in magnitude. Practitioners and individuals who are involved in financial decisions
regarding healthcare reimbursement should be
aware that variables other than evidence-based
medicine and patient preference may influence
treatment decisions significantly.
