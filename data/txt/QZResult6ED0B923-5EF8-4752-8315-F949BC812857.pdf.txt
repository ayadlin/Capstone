Abstract
Nanoparticle therapeutics are promising platforms for cancer therapy. However, it remains a formidable
challenge to assess their distribution and clinical efficacy for therapeutic applications. Here, by using multifunctional polymeric micellar nanocarriers incorporating clinically approved gadolinium (Gd)–based magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents and platinum (Pt) anticancer drugs through reversible metal
chelation of Pt, simultaneous imaging and therapy of an orthotopic animal model of intractable human
pancreatic tumor was successfully performed without any serious toxicity. The strong tumor contrast enhancement achieved by the micelles correlated with the 24 times increase of r1 of the Gd chelates, the
highest for the formulations using clinically approved Gd chelates reported to date. From the microsynchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence spectrometry scanning of the lesions, we confirmed that both
the Gd chelates and Pt drugs delivered by the micelles selectively colocalized in the tumor interior. Our
study provides new insights for the design of theranostic micelles with high contrast enhancement and
site-specific clinical potential. Cancer Res; 70(18); 7031–41. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Recently, there has been explosive development of chemotherapeutic agents for cancer, but the efficacies of anticancer
drugs are still insufficient particularly for the treatment of intractable tumors, including pancreatic cancer. Although the
latest advances in molecular targeting agents have shown specific efficiency, the survival time of patients is often extended
only slightly, even when these agents are used in combination
with other anticancer drugs. Moreover, the use of such drugs
typically results in various characteristic side effects, such as
interstitial pneumonia for gefitinib (1), cardiotoxicity for trastuzumab (2, 3), and thrombosis for bevacizumab (4). Alternatives to developing these compounds and antibodies selective
for cancer cells, with the aim of modulating drug distribution

in the body to accomplish selective drug accumulation in the
tumor site, are thus needed, and for this purpose, nanometricscale vehicles or nanocarriers directing therapeutics to the
tumor site are a key platform.
In the last decade, several kinds of nanoparticle therapeutics platforms, including liposomes, nanoparticles, and polymeric micelles, have been developed to selectively deliver
drugs to tumor sites (5–12). These approaches have been used
to improve the therapeutic efficacy and to reduce the side effects of drugs incorporated in delivery carriers (13, 14), and
nanoparticle therapeutics such as Doxil (15) or Abraxane
(16) are already in clinical use. The tumor targeting of these
nanoparticle therapeutics is based on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect (in other words, the increased accumulation of high–molecular weight compounds,
such as nanoparticles, in tumor tissue due to the high permeability of tumor blood vessels and the retention of these compounds because of the impaired lymphatic drainage at the
cancer site; ref. 17). In the late 1980s, we developed one of
the auspicious nanoparticle therapeutics, polymeric micelles,
a self-assembly of amphiphilic block copolymers consisting
of hydrophobic segments forming the drug-loaded core and
water-soluble segments forming the biocompatible shell (11,
12). The main advantages of this system are the possibility of
incorporating a variety of drugs, including hydrophobic substances, metal complexes, and charged macromolecules such
as nucleic acids, as well as controlling their release properties
by engineering and modifying the micelle-forming block copolymers. Moreover, polymeric micelles can be designed to be responsive to environmental changes and capable of target

recognition. Our micelle formulations incorporating Adriamycin, paclitaxel, SN-38, cisplatin, and DACHPt (activated
oxaliplatin; NK911, NK105, NK012, NC6004, and NC4016, respectively) are being examined in clinical studies, and four
of these formulations have advanced to phase II studies
(18–21). These clinical studies have revealed that polymeric
micelles showed reduced side effects and high effectiveness
against various intractable tumors, including triple-negative
breast cancers that do not express the genes for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and Her2/neu (22). Consequently, polymeric micelles have been considered one of
the most promising drug delivery systems (DDS) in the field
of cancer chemotherapy.
Although a crucial breakthrough in cancer treatment has
been achieved using several micelles, the methods for estimating the distribution and effectiveness of the micelles
are ineffective and inadequate. The precise monitoring of
their distribution and early feedback on treatment efficacy
would allow clinicians to anticipate the therapeutic process
in each cancer patient and customize medicine for cancer
therapy. Thus, it is imperative to directly assess the biodistribution of the micelles and their cargo as well as the magnitude of their accumulation at the cancer site. Consequently,

the development of micelles with both imaging and therapeutic functions [theranostic (23) micelles] will permit visualization of the distribution of the micelles inside the body
and tumor in a real-time manner, allowing optimization of
the treatment protocol according to the unique characteristics of the malignancies in individual patients (24–26).
We developed theranostic core-shell polymeric micelles
based on the self-assembly of block copolymers with both
a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) function and cancer
therapeutic capacity. The micelles incorporate gadolinium–
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA), a widely
used T1-weighted MRI (T1W) contrast agent (27), and (1,2diaminocyclohexane)platinum(II) (DACHPt), the parent
complex of the potent anticancer drug oxaliplatin, in their
core by reversible complexation between DACHPt, Gd-DTPA,
and poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(glutamic acid) [PEG-bP(Glu); Fig. 1]. Accordingly, both the DACHPt and Gd-DTPA
complexes, which can be excreted from the kidney, thus
avoiding toxicity from long-term accumulation inside the
body, are released from the micelles in a sustained manner
under physiologic conditions. Moreover, the longitudinal relaxivity (r1) of the micelles (i.e., their ability as an MRI contrast agent) increased ∼24 times compared with that of free

Visible DDS for Diagnosis and Therapy of Solid Tumors

Gd-DTPA, enabling, jointly with the enhanced tumor accumulation provided by the EPR effect, the improved detection of
solid tumors. We also showed that the micelles have continuous and strong anticancer effect, and enhance the MRI contrast of the tumor region in an orthotopic human pancreatic
cancer xenograft model much more intensely than Gd-DTPA
alone, although the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic
cancer has been considered to be the most difficult among digestive cancers. Thus, the Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles
are expected not only to improve the effectiveness and safety
of the incorporated drugs but also to assist in the real-time
monitoring of the drug distribution and tumor accumulation,
suggesting the great potential of visible DDSs.

Materials and Methods
Cancer cell lines and animals
Murine colon adenocarcinoma 26 (C-26) cells were kindly
supplied by the National Cancer Center. The BxPC3 human
pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line was obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection. C-26 and BxPC3 cells
were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37°C. CDF1 mice and BALB/c nude mice
(female; 18–20 g body weight; 6 weeks old) were purchased
from Charles River Japan. All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the policies of the Animal Ethics
Committee of the University of Tokyo.
Preparation of Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles
PEG-b-P(Glu) [MwPEG = 12,000 Da; polymerization degree
of P(Glu) = 20] block copolymer was synthesized according
to the previously described method (28). Briefly, the N-carboxy
anhydride of γ-benzyl L-glutamate (Sigma Chemical) was synthesized by the Fuchs-Farthing method using triphosgene.
Then, N-carboxy anhydride of γ-benzyl L-glutamate was polymerized in DMF initiated by the primary amino group of
CH3O-PEG-NH2 (Nippon Oil and Fats) to obtain PEG-b-poly
(γ-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PEG-b-PBLG). The polymerization
degree was verified by comparing the proton ratios of methylene units in PEG (-OCH2CH2-: δ = 3.7 ppm) and phenyl groups
of PBLG (-CH2C6H5: δ = 7.3 ppm) in 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurement (solvent: DMSO-d6; JEOL EX270,
JEOL, Inc.). PEG-b-PBLG was deprotected by mixing with 0.5 N
NaOH at room temperature to obtain PEG-b-P(Glu). Complete
deprotection was confirmed by 1H-NMR measurement (solvent: D2O; temperature: 25°C).
Gd-DTPA (Aldrich Chemical) was converted to sodium
salt by adjusting the pH to 7 with NaOH, and it was lyophilized. A 5 mmol/L solution of bis(nitrato) (trans-l-1,2-diaminocyclohexane)platinum(II) [DACHPt(NO3)2; W.C. Heraeus
GmbH & Co. KG] in water was mixed with the sodium salt
of Gd-DTPA (5 mmol/L), and the solution was maintained for
24 hours at 37°C. Then, PEG-b-P(Glu) ([Glu] = 5 mmol/L) was
added to this solution ([DACHPt]/[Glu] = 1.0) and reacted
for 120 hours at 37°C to prepare Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded
micelles. The micelles were purified by dialysis against

www.aacrjournals.org

distilled water [molecular weight cutoff size (MWCO):
2,000; Spectra/Por-6, Spectrum Laboratories] and by ultrafiltration (MWCO: 30,000). The size distribution of the
Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles was evaluated by a
dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurement at 25°C using a
Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern Instruments). The Pt and
Gd contents of the micelles were determined by inductively
coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; 4500 ICP-MS,
Hewlett Packard).
Fourier transform IR spectra of Gd-DTPA/DACHPt
aqueous complex
Fourier transform IR (FT-IR) spectra were obtained using
a FT-IR spectrophotometer (FT/IR 615, JASCO Corp.) with a
resolution of 4 cm−1. To characterize the interaction between
Gd-DTPA and DACHPt, freeze-dried Gd-DTPA/DACHPt
complex at 1:1, 1:5, and 1:10 mixing ratios was milled with
KBr and then pressed into a disc for analysis.
Arsenazo III colorimetric assay
The absence of Gd3+ in the Gd-DTPA/DACHPt mixture
was confirmed by using the arsenazo III method (29). Briefly,
Gd-DTPA and DACHPt were mixed at 1:1 molar ratio
(0.2 mmol/L) in water. Then, 0.5 mL of this solution was
mixed with 0.5 mL of arsenazo III (0.2 mmol/L; SigmaAldrich). The absorbance spectra were measured with a spectrometer (V-570 UV/VIS/NIR Spectrophotometer, JASCO). A
calibration curve was obtained by measuring the absorbance
at 660 nm of a series of standard solutions of the arsenazo
III/Gd3+ complex prepared by mixing solutions of GdCl3
(Sigma-Aldrich) and arsenazo III in water. The pH of the
solutions was maintained at 6.5.
Release rate of DACHPt and Gd-DTPA from the
Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles
The release of DACHPt and Gd-DTPA complexes from the
micelles was studied by the dialysis method. One milliliter of
Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles solution was introduced
in a dialysis bag (MWCO: 6,000) and incubated in 99 mL micelles in physiologic conditions (i.e., 10 mmol/L PBS plus
150 mmol/L NaCl at 37°C). The solution outside the dialysis
bag was sampled at defined periods. The concentration of Pt
and Gd was measured by ICP-MS. The UV-Vis spectra of GdDTPA, GdCl3, and the solution outside the dialysis bag were
recorded from 270 nm to 280 nm with a UV-Vis spectrometer
(V-570 UV/VIS/NIR Spectrophotometer).
Kinetic stability of Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles
The stability of the Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles in
physiologic conditions was determined by DLS and static
light scattering using a Zetasizer Nano ZS90. The changes
in the light scattering intensity were measured at defined
time periods. In this analysis, a decrease in the light scattering intensity was associated with a decrease in the apparent
molecular weight of the micelles and drug density inside the
micelle core as well as in the micelle concentration. The size
distribution of the Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles was
simultaneously monitored.

Characterization of the r1 relaxivities
The MR contrast effect of the magnetic nanoparticles was
examined by measuring their proton longitudinal relaxivities, r1, of which the definition is the slope of the concentration dependence given as 1/T1 = 1/T10 + r1[Gd], where T1
is the longitudinal relaxation time, 1/T1 is the longitudinal
relaxation rate contrast in the presence of a paramagnetic
species, and 1/T10 is the longitudinal relaxation rate contrast
in the absence of a paramagnetic species. The T1 of Gd-DTPA/
DACHPt–loaded micelles, Gd-DTPA, or Gd-DTPA/DACHPt
solution at 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 mmol/L was measured at
37°C in water with a 0.59-T 1H-NMR analyzer (JNM-MU25A,
JEOL) with a standard inversion-recovery pulse sequence.
Cancer models
CDF1 mice (female, 6 weeks old) were inoculated s.c.
with C-26 cells (1 × 106/mL) and used for biodistribution
study, antitumor activity assay, and MRI. BALB/c nude
mice (female, 6 weeks old) were inoculated in the pancreas
with BxPC3 cells for biodistribution study, antitumor activity assay, and MRI. For the latter model, the mice were
anesthetized by isoflurane inhalation, and the pancreas
was exposed and injected subserosally with 0.1 mL of
BxPC3 cells (5 × 106/mL).
Biodistribution
Biodistribution studies were carried out on C-26 tumor–
bearing mice at 10 days after implantation when the mean
tumor volume was ∼100 mm3. Oxaliplatin, Gd-DTPA, or GdDTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles were i.v. injected to mice at
a dose of 100 μg per mouse on a Pt basis or 100 μg per
mouse on a Gd basis. The mice were sacrificed after defined
time periods (1, 4, 8, and 24 hours). Tumors, livers, kidneys,
and spleens were excised. Blood was collected from the inferior vena cava, heparinized, and centrifuged to obtain the
plasma. The samples were dissolved in HNO3 and evaporated to dryness. The Pt and Gd concentrations were then
measured by ICP-MS after the samples were redissolved
in 5 N HCl.
In vivo MRI of Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles
MR images were obtained using a 4.7-T UNITY INOVA imaging spectrometer (Varian, Inc.) equipped with a birdcagetype RF coil, 66 mm in diameter. For the T1W of the mice,
the following parameters were adopted: spin-echo method,
repetition time (TR) = 500 ms, echo time (TE) = 15 ms, field
of view (FOV) = 32 × 32 mm2, matrix size = 256 × 256, and
slice thickness = 2 mm. MR images were obtained from C-26
tumor– and BxPC3 tumor–bearing mice when the mean tumor volume was 100 and 400 mm3, respectively. For all of the
mice, transaxial T1W images were taken before injecting GdDTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles as a control. The mice were
anesthetized with 1.2% isoflurane during the MRI experiments. The mice were injected i.v. with 5 μmol/kg of GdDTPA alone or Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles. The
transaxial T1W images were taken with a phantom containing water as a reference signal every 10 minutes for 4 hours.
The images were analyzed using Mathematica (Wolfram Re-

search, Inc.) and Excel (Microsoft, Inc.). For each time point,
the same level of slices that included the center of the tumors
was chosen and segmented by drawing a square that included the tumor area. The pixel intensities in the tissues were
compared with the precontrast images and the phantom.
Assessment of therapeutic effect by MRI
MR images were obtained using a 7.0-T MRI scanner
(magnet: Kobelco and Jastec; console: Bruker Biospin) with a
birdcage-type RF coil, 35 mm in diameter (Rapid Biomedical).
The experiment was carried out on BxPC3 tumor–bearing
mice at 10 days after implantation when the average size
of the tumor was ∼60 mm3. Mice (n = 2) were initially anesthetized with 3.0% isoflurane, orally intubated, and then ventilated with 2.0% isoflurane (Abbott Japan) and 1:2 O2/room
air gas mixture using a rodent ventilator (MRI-1, CWE, Inc.).
During MRI scanning, rectal temperature was continuously
monitored and maintained at 37.0 ± 0.5°C using a heating
pad throughout all scans. T1W MRIs were obtained before
and 2 hours after administration of the Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–
loaded micelles. The Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles
were injected i.v. at 8 mg/kg on a Pt base and 3 mg/kg on a
Gd-DTPA base. The control mice were injected i.v. with
30 mg/kg of Gd-DTPA, and they were imaged before and
30 minutes after the injection. The drugs were injected on
days 0, 4, 8, 11, and 18. T1W multislice two-dimensional spin
echo MRI with fat suppression preparation was obtained with
the following parameters: TR = 600 ms (respiratory gating of
100 rpm), TE = 9.5 ms, FOV = 32 × 32 mm2, matrix size = 256 ×
256, slice thickness = 1 mm, and average = 4. Slice orientation
of the T1W was transaxial (18 slices, nongap) and horizontal
(14 slice, nongap).
Image reconstruction and analysis were performed using
ParaVision (version 4.0; Bruker Biospin) and ImageJ (version
1.43; NIH). Regions of interest were identified using a mouse
atlas of anatomy, and the volume of the tumors was estimated by the following equation: V = a × b2/2, where a and b are
the major and minor axes of the orthotopic tumors measured from the MR images.
Histology and immunohistochemistry
The excised samples were directly frozen in liquid N2 for immunohistochemistry or fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and
then paraffin embedded to prepare them for H&E staining.
Frozen samples were sectioned at 16-μm thickness in a cryostat, fixed in acetone, and incubated with protein blocking solution (Blocking One Buffer, Nakalai Tesque, Inc.), PECAM-1
(BD Pharmingen), Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (Invitrogen Molecular Probes), and Hoechst (Sigma-Aldrich). The
samples were observed by using a Zeiss LSM510 Meta confocal
microscope for immunohistochemistry and an Olympus AX80
microscope for H&E staining.
Micro-synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence
spectrometry analysis
Mice bearing BxPC3 orthotopic tumors were injected i.v.
with doses of 3 mg/kg (on a Pt base) of Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–
loaded micelles. Four hours after the injection, the mice were

sacrificed and the tumors were excised, frozen in liquid N2,
sliced at 16 μm using a cryostat, and fixed on a polypropylene sheet. Micro-synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence
spectrometry (μ-SR-XRF) was performed using beamline
37XU (30) at SPring-8, operated at 8 GeV and ∼100 mA.
The tissue samples were irradiated with incident X-rays with
an energy of 14 keV, a beam spot size of 1.3 × 1.3 μm2, and
an intensity of 1012 photons/s. The fluorescence X-rays were
measured using a Si solid-state detector in air at room temperature. Each sample was mounted on an x-y translation
stage. The fluorescence X-ray intensity was normalized by
the incident X-ray intensity, I0, to produce a two-dimensional
elemental map.

Results
Characterization of Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles
The core-shell micellar nanocarriers with PEG palisade
were prepared by preincubating Gd-DTPA and DACHPt at
a 1:1 molar ratio for >10 hours in water and mixing this
solution with PEG-b-P(Glu) (Fig. 1). The incubation of

DACHPt with Gd-DTPA may lead to the formation of carboxylato complexes between DACHPt and the carboxylic
groups in the DTPA chelator of Gd-DTPA. Accordingly, the
FT-IR spectra of the DACHPt, Gd-DTPA, and Gd-DTPA/
DACHPt mixtures incubated for 24 hours (Fig. 2A) indicated
the appearance of a peak at 1,650 cm−1 in the spectra of the
Gd-DTPA/DACHPt mixtures assigned to the Pt-COO coordination bond. Moreover, the optimal mixing ratio and incubation time of Gd-DTPA and DACHPt were determined by
relaxivity titration. The r1 of the Gd-DTPA/DACHPt complexes gradually increased up to 4.6 mmol/L−1s−1 at a 1:1
ratio from the initial 3.4 mmol/L−1s−1 of Gd-DTPA alone
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). At DACHPt/Gd-DTPA ratios
higher than 1, the r1 remained constant. In addition, the
r1 of the Gd-DTPA/DACHPt complex gradually increased
until 10 hours after mixing. Moreover, the activated state
of DACHPt was found to be necessary for binding to GdDTPA because the Gd-DTPA/oxaliplatin mixture revealed
no increase in the relaxivity (Supplementary Fig. S1B). During the Gd-DTPA/DACHPt complex formation, the stability
of the Gd-DTPA complex was evaluated by using the arsenazo III method (29). Consequently, the absence of Gd3+

in the Gd-DTPA/DACHPt mixture was confirmed (Supplementary Fig. S2).
The obtained micelles were 33 nm in diameter with a
narrow size distribution (polydispersity index = 0.067;
Fig. 2B). This diameter might be small enough for the micelles to avoid recognition by the reticuloendothelial system, pass through the leaky vasculature of solid tumors
by the EPR effect, and attain deep tumor penetration (17).
The amounts of DACHPt and Gd-DTPA incorporated in the
micelles were found to be 0.42 mg DACHPt/mg polymer
and 0.04 mg Gd-DTPA/mg polymer, corresponding to 45%
and 5% of the carboxylic groups in PEG-b-P(Glu), respectively. Moreover, the r1 of the micelles increased up to
80.7 mmol/L−1s−1, that is, ∼24-fold greater than Gd-DTPA
alone (Fig. 2C).
The Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles did not release
their contents in distilled water (data not shown). However,
under physiologic conditions (i.e., 10 mmol/L PBS at 37°C),
DACHPt and Gd-DTPA were released in a sustained manner
(Fig. 2D, left). Moreover, the release of Gd-DTPA was considerably faster than that of DACHPt, probably due to stronger
binding between polymer and DACHPt than between
DACHPt and Gd-DTPA. In addition, the safe Gd-DTPA chelates in this system might remain stable because no free Gd3+
was detected in the released sample (Supplementary Fig. S3).
The gradual drug release from Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded
micelles led to a reduction in the light scattering intensity
of the micelles (Fig. 2D, middle) due to the decreased density
of the micellar cores. Accordingly, the light scattering intensity of the Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles under
physiologic conditions decreased to 20% in ∼60 hours
(Fig. 2D, middle); however, the hydrodynamic diameter of
the micelles was maintained at ∼30 nm for >48 hours
(Fig. 2D, right). The high stability of the micelles and preservation of their hydrodynamic diameter are advantageous
in the in vivo situation because the structural stability of
micelles is highly associated with their prolonged blood circulation (11).
In vivo performance of Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded
micelles
The Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles extended the circulation of their cargo in the bloodstream, attaining ∼20% of
the injected dose of DACHPt after 24 hours and >8% of the
injected dose of Gd-DTPA after 4 hours, whereas free oxaliplatin and free Gd-DTPA were rapidly cleared from plasma
(Fig. 3A). Moreover, the micelles delivered the drugs to solid
tumors due to the increased accumulation and retention at
the cancer site because of the EPR effect. Accordingly, the
micelles augmented the tumor accumulation 27.7 times for
the Pt drug at 24 hours, and >100 times for Gd-DTPA at 4
hours, in subcutaneous murine colon adenocarcinoma 26
(C-26) tumors (Fig. 3B) compared with oxaliplatin and free
Gd-DTPA, resulting in high MRI contrast enhancement of
the tumor tissue (Fig. 3C). From the ratio of the signal intensities of tumor to muscle, the micelles showed to increase the
contrast, whereas the enhancement for Gd-DTPA was almost
unchanged. Moreover, the elevated tumor accumulation of

7036

Cancer Res; 70(18) September 15, 2010

Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles may also improve the
antitumor activity of the incorporated Pt drug because
DACHPt complexes can exert their cytotoxicity after being
released from the Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles, as observed in in vitro studies (Supplementary Table S1). Accordingly, the micelles showed strong antitumor effect against
the C-26 tumor model (Supplementary Fig. S4). Thus, we
tested the potential of Gd-DTPA–loaded micelles for monitoring the drug distribution, tumor imaging, and treatment
in a pancreatic tumor model close to the clinical situation
(i.e., orthotopically inoculated BxPC3 human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumor).
Direct detection and treatment of pancreatic cancer
The T1W T1-weighted MR images after i.v. administration of the Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles clearly
showed specific contrast enhancement at the tumor area
for >4 hours (Fig. 4A and B). In contrast, we did not observe any enhancement in the tumor region after the administration of free Gd-DTPA (Fig. 4A and B), and the
signal intensity was higher in the liver, kidney, or spleen
than in tumor as suggested from the tumor-to-organ ratios
of the MR intensity (Supplementary Table S2). Also, the
signals in all organs decreased after 1 hour. The macroscopic observation of the orthotopic tumor-bearing mice
that received Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles confirmed
the position of every organ and the tumor (Fig. 4D, left and
middle), whereas the histologic study of the malignancy
revealed the poorly differentiated histology of pancreatic
adenocarcinoma, with thick fibrosis and low vascularization
(Fig. 4D, right). The amount of Gd-DTPA delivered by the
micelles in the orthotopic pancreatic tumor was seven times
higher than the accumulation of free Gd-DTPA (Fig. 4C).
Accordingly, 3.5% of the total Gd dose from the micelles
and 7.2% of the total Pt dose had accumulated within
4 hours of administration.
The antitumor activity of Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles was also evaluated by MRI. Thus, the mice treated with
the micelles at 8 mg/kg on a Pt base achieved a significant
reduction in the volume of orthotopic BxPC3 tumors
(Fig. 5A). Likewise, the weight of the pancreas at day 18 of
the micelle-treated animal was much lower than the mice
that received only Gd-DTPA (Fig. 5B). Moreover, Gd-DTPA/
DACHPt–loaded micelles were shown to enhance the signal
intensity at the tumor region (Fig. 5C). Thus, Gd-DTPA/
DACHPt–loaded micelle can be used to follow the micelle
accumulation in the tumor and the tumor size by MRI, supporting the theranostic concept.
The microdistribution of the drugs at the tumor site was
studied using μ-SR-XRF on the pancreatic lesions. Besides
the elements traditionally present in animal tissue, such as
S, Cl, K, Ca, Fe, Cu, Ni, and Zn, very distinct Pt-L and Gd-L
peaks can also be observed in the sum spectrum of the line
scan. Thus, the distribution of several atoms (Fe, K, Gd, and
Pt) in the tissue sections of the whole pancreas was studied
to evaluate the tissue properties and layout of the drugs. The
elemental mapping of Fe presents areas with high concentration probably involving the vicinity of blood vessels and the

Discussion
Pancreatic cancer has one of the worst prognoses among
cancers (32). The high malignancy of pancreatic adenocarcinoma prompts the destruction of the surrounding tissue,
whereas the lack of serous membrane in healthy pancreas
cannot prevent the dissemination of cancer cells. The microenvironment characteristics of the pancreatic adenocarcinoma, including hypovascularity and thick fibrosis, prevent the
accumulation of drugs in the tumor tissue (33). Moreover,
the anatomic position of the pancreas in the deep retroperitoneal space makes early detection difficult. Although com-

7038

Cancer Res; 70(18) September 15, 2010

puted tomography is widely used for the evaluation of
pancreatic carcinoma in the clinical setting, MRI may better
predict the therapeutic efficacy and the prognosis in patients
with pancreatic cancer because of its superior contrast resolution of noncontour deforming lesions of the pancreas,
small liver metastases, and peritoneal disseminations (34).
Thus, the outstanding contrast enhancement achieved by
Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles on this tumor model
suggests the great potential of this modality for the clear detection of the lesions in the abdominal cavity and the facile
recognition of the carcinomas of the pancreas as distinct
from the surrounding internal organs by MRI.
The exceptionally bright contrast achieved by Gd-DTPA/
DACHPt–loaded micelles can be attributed to the enhanced
accumulation of the micelles at the tumor site and to the

augmentation of the relaxivity of the Gd-DTPA in the core of
the micelles. The amount of Gd-DTPA delivered by the micelles in the orthotopic pancreatic tumor was >3% of the
injected dose after 4 hours. Because the r1 of Gd-DTPA in
the micelles is 24 times higher than that of free Gd-DTPA,
the resulting contrast enhancement probably mimics a much
higher accumulation level. In this regard, it has been reported
that the r1 of Gd-based MRI contrast agents increases after
binding with polymers or proteins due to the flexibility reduction per Gd molecule and the increase of the rotational correlation time (τR; ref. 35). Moreover, Livramento and colleagues
(36) suggested that an Fe/Gd chelate, a metallostar Fe{Gd2(bipyridine(diethylenetriaminetetraacetic acid) 2 (H 2 O) 4 ) 3 } 4structure, showed a high relaxivity because the inner-sphere
water molecules presented an exchange rate (τm) close to the
optimal value in addition to the increasing τR. In our system,
the formation of the Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles
probably combined an increase of the τR and the optimization

of the τm in the hydrophobic environment at the micelle core,
leading to the increase in relaxivity. Further studies are needed to establish the mechanism of the relaxivity enhancement
of Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles, and they are currently
under way in our laboratory.
The construction of macromolecular MRI contrast agents
has been an attractive strategy to achieve diagnostic agents
with extended blood circulation. Nevertheless, for Gd-based
contrast agents, this approach could increase the risk
of toxicity due to the prolonged tissue exposure to those
macromolecules and the potential release of Gd 3+ ions.
Thus, the accumulation of high-generation dendrimer contrast agents in the healthy tissues might potentiate the
nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity risks (37). Accordingly,
only 20% of the injected dose of a generation 4–based
PAMAM-Gd contrast agent was excreted from the body
during the first 2 days, showing transient accumulation in
the renal tubules. In contrast to this, the biodistribution of

sections 4 h after injection of the micelles. The cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst, and the blood vessels were marked with PECAM-1 antibody. Scale
bars, 100 μm. B, K, Fe, Pt, and Gd distribution in a tumor section including normal pancreatic tissue determined by μ-SR-XRF. Scale bars, 100 μm.

Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles revealed minimal accumulation of Gd-DTPA in normal tissues. Moreover, the GdDTPA released from the micelles probably is rapidly excreted
from the body because of the relatively fast plasma clearance
of low–molecular weight Gd-DTPA, thus eliminating the
risk of undesired toxicity.
The real-time observation of drug distribution can increase the accuracy of treatment and enable practitioners
to obtain feedback on the therapeutic efficacy at an earlier
stage, and promptly adjust the treatment strategy. GdDTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles might be helpful for directly
assessing the distribution of the anticancer drugs at early
stages by MRI. In this study, the μ-XRF results showed that
the delivered Gd-DTPA and DACHPt were colocalized and
uniformly distributed within the pancreatic tumors, whereas
there was no drug accumulation in healthy pancreas, supporting the strong diagnostic and anticancer effect of the micelles (Fig. 6B, Pt and Gd). Moreover, the chemotherapy
regimens are given in periodic cycles, for example, one cycle
every 2 weeks during 12 weeks in FOLFOX (folinic acid, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin) regimen for the treatment of colorectal cancer. By using Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles,
the tumor size can be followed up in real-time by imaging
at the day of the drug administration. Consequently, the

Gd-DTPA/DACHPt–loaded micelles will have significant implications in the design and development of advanced multifunctional nanomedicines with great potential for clinical
application as visible DDS.
