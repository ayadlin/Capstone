Abstract
Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a rare thyroid cancer
type with an extremely poor prognosis. Despite appropriate
treatment, which includes surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, this cancer is invariably fatal. CXCR4 is the receptor
for the stromal cell–derived factor-1 (SDF-1)/CXCL12 chemokine and it is expressed in a variety of solid tumors, including
papillary thyroid carcinoma. Here, we show that ATC cell lines
overexpress CXCR4, both at the level of mRNA and protein.
Furthermore, we found that CXCR4 was overexpressed in ATC
clinical samples, with respect to normal thyroid tissues by
real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. Treatment of ATC
cells with SDF-1 induced proliferation and increase in
phosphorylation of extracellular signal–regulated kinases
and protein kinase B/AKT. These effects were blocked by the
specific CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 and by CXCR4 RNA
interference. Moreover, AMD3100 effectively reduced tumor
growth in nude mice inoculated with different ATC cells.
Thus, we suggest that CXCR4 targeting is a novel potential
strategy in the treatment of human ATC. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Thyroid cancer accounts for the majority of endocrine neoplasms worldwide (1). Malignant tumors derived from the thyroid
gland include well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas (WDTC;
papillary and follicular) and undifferentiated or anaplastic thyroid
carcinomas (ATC). Another group of cancers falls between these
two types, the so-called poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas
(PDC). WDTC represents >90% of all thyroid cancers, whereas
ATC accounts for approximately 2% to 5% of them (2–4). WDTC
management requires surgery and adjuvant radioactive iodine
(5, 6). Whereas most of the patients with WDTC have an excellent
prognosis, those that present with PDC or ATC have a poor
prognosis. PDC displays intermediate biological and clinical
features between WDTC and ATC. Indeed, these tumors display
high propensity to recur and metastasize. Furthermore, they tend
to a progressive dedifferentiation, which leads to the decrease in
the levels of the sodium iodide symporter. As a consequence of this,

these tumors are unable to concentrate iodine and become
resistant to radiometabolic therapy (4, 7). ATC is the most
malignant thyroid tumor and one of the more fatal human
malignancy with a median survival from the time of diagnosis of
only 4 to 12 months (8, 9). ATC is more frequent in iodine-deficient
areas and can be associated with other thyroid disorders. These
tumors arise at a mean age of 55 to 65 years, are more common in
women, and present usually as a rapidly growing mass, localized in
the anterior neck area, which rapidly metastasizes at lungs, bone,
and brain. Treatment of ATC with surgery, radiotherapy, and
chemotherapy, alone or in combination, shows little or no effect on
patient’s survival (10). For these reasons, novel treatment strategies
are urgently needed. Unlike the WDTC, the molecular mechanisms
underlying the development of human ATC are largely unknown.
Genetic rearrangements of the RET and TRKA tyrosine kinase
receptors, point mutations of the BRAF serine-threonine kinase or,
less frequently, RAS mutations, are typically found in papillary
thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Rearrangements of PPARg or RAS point
mutations are instead found in human FTC (11, 12). Among these
genetic alterations, RAS or BRAF point mutations are detected at
low frequency in ATC, suggesting that some ATC may arise from a
preexisting WDTC, whereas others arise de novo (12, 13).
Inactivating point mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor and
activating point mutations of the b-catenin or the PIK3CA are also
found in ATC (13–15).
In the attempt to better characterize human ATC at the
molecular level, we aimed to study the involvement of chemokine
and chemokine receptors in these tumors. Chemokines are small
secretory proteins that were initially reported to control the
recruitment and the activation of immune cells in inflammation
(16). These molecules exert their action through binding to a group
of seven-transmembrane G protein–coupled receptors. All chemokine receptors initiate signal transduction by activating a member
of the Gi family of G proteins which, on receptor activation,
dissociates into a and hg subunits. The Ga subunit inhibits
adenylyl cyclase, whereas the Ghg dimer activates the phospholipase Ch and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways, with the
activation of downstream signaling. It has becoming clear recently
that chemokines are also involved in cancer cell migration,
survival, and growth (17). Not only chemokines regulate some
important features of cancer cells but are also involved in the
regulation of tumor angiogenesis and leukocyte recruitment (17).
In particular, the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its ligand stromal
cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)/CXCL12 have been implicated in the
metastatic spread of breast cancer cells (18). CXCR4 is one of the

most important chemokine receptors for cancer cells. Indeed, it is
expressed in a great number of human solid and hematologic
cancers, including breast, prostate, brain, colon, and lung cancer
(19, 20). We and others previously reported the overexpression and
functional activity of CXCR4 in thyroid cancer (21, 22). In this
report, we show that human ATC cells express high levels of CXCR4
and that the CXCR4-SDF-1/CXCL12 axis sustains the growth of
ATC cells. Finally, we provide evidences that targeting CXCR4
might be exploited as a novel anticancer therapy for human ATC.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. Human primary cultures of normal thyroid and ATC cells
were obtained from F. Curcio (Dipartimento di Patologia e Medicina
Sperimentale e Clinica, University of Udine, Udine, Italy; P5, P5-2N,
P5-3N, P5-4N, and HTU8) and H. Zitzelsberger (Institute of Molecular
Radiobiology, GSF-National Research Center for Environment and Health
GmbH, Neuherberg, Germany; S11T, S77T, and S14T) and cultured as
described previously (23). Primary cultures of ATC were also a kind gift of
H. Zitzelsberger. Of these, only the S11T displays a BRAF(V600E) mutation
in heterozygosis.4 Human thyroid papillary cancer cell lines TPC1, FB2, and
NIM have been described previously (24–26). TPC1 and FB2 cells harbor a
RET/PTC1 rearrangement. NPA87 cells derive from a PDC and harbor a
BRAF(V600E) mutation in homozygosis (23). The anaplastic cells ARO,
KAT4, BHT101, and FB1 cells harbor a BRAF(V600E) mutation in
heterozygosis; 8505C and FRO harbor a BRAF(V600E) mutation in
homozygosis (23); and CAL62 cells express wild-type BRAF but mutant
NRAS allele. Continuous cell lines were maintained in DMEM supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% glutamine.
RNA extraction and reverse transcription PCR. Total RNA was
isolated by the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and subjected to on-column DNase
digestion with the RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The quality of RNA was verified by electrophoresis through 1% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide.
RNA (1 Ag) from each sample was reverse transcribed with the QuantiTect
Reverse Transcription (Qiagen) using an optimized blend of oligo(dT) and
random primers according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To design
a quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay, we used the
Human ProbeLibray system (Exiqon). Briefly, Exiqon provides 90 human
prevalidated Taqman probes (8–9 nucleotides long) that recognize f99% of
human transcripts in the RefSeq database at the National Center for
Biotechnology Information. The ProbeFinder assay design software
(available online)5 was used to design primer pairs and probes. All
fluorogenic probes were dual labeled with FAM at 5¶-end and with a black
quencher at the 3¶-end. Primer pairs and PCR conditions are available on
request. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed in a Chromo 4 Detector (MJ
Research) in 96-well plates using a final volume of 20 AL. For each PCR, 8 AL
of 2.5 RealMasterMix Probe ROX (Eppendorf AG), 200 nmol/L of each
primer, 100 nmol/L probe, and cDNA generated from 50 ng of total RNA
were used. PCRs were performed in triplicate and fold changes were
calculated with the following formula: 2 (sample 1 DC t sample 2 DC t), where
DCt is the difference between the amplification fluorescent thresholds of
the mRNA of interest and the mRNA of RNA polymerase 2 used as an
internal reference.
Immunohistochemistry. Retrospectively collected archival thyroid
tissue samples from patients affected by ATCs were retrieved from the
files of the Pathology Department of the University of Pisa on informed
consent. Sections (4 Am thick) of paraffin-embedded samples were stained
with H&E for histologic examination to ensure that the samples fulfilled the
diagnostic criteria required for the identification of ATC. Normal thyroid
tissue samples were also retrieved from the files of the Pathology
Department of the University of Pisa.

For immunohistochemistry, paraffin sections (3–5 Am) were dewaxed in
xylene, dehydrated through graded alcohols, and blocked with 5%
nonimmune mouse serum in PBS with 0.05% sodium azide for 5 min.
Mouse monoclonal antibody against CXCR4 (clone 12G5; R&D Systems)
was added at 1:1,000 dilution for 15 min. After incubation with biotinylated
anti-mouse secondary antibody for 15 min followed by streptavidin-biotin
complex for 15 min (Catalyzed Signal Amplification System, DAKO), sections
were developed for 5 min with 0.05% 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and 0.01% hydrogen peroxide in 0.05 mol/L Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6),
counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted.
Protein studies. Immunoblotting experiments were performed according to standard procedures. Briefly, cells were harvested in lysis buffer
[50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton
X-100, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 10 mmol/L NaF, 10 mmol/L
sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 10 Ag/mL aprotinin, 10 Ag/mL
leupeptin] and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000  g. For protein
extraction from human tissues, snap-frozen samples were immediately
homogenized in lysis buffer by using the Mixer Mill apparatus (Qiagen).
Protein concentration was estimated with a modified Bradford assay (BioRad). Antigens were revealed by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection
kit (Amersham). Anti-CXCR4 antibodies were from Abcam Ltd. For the
evaluation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT activity on
SDF-1a triggering, BHT101 and S11T cells were serum deprived for 12 h and
then stimulated with human recombinant SDF-1a (R&D Systems) for the
indicated time. Anti-phosphorylated p44/42 MAPK, anti-p44/42 MAPK,
anti-phosphorylated AKT, and anti-AKT antibodies were from New England
Biolabs. Anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody was from Sigma Chemical.
Secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies coupled to horseradish
peroxidase were from Bio-Rad.
Flow cytometric analysis. Subconfluent cells were detached from
culture dishes with a solution of 0.5 mmol/L EDTA and then washed thrice
in PBS buffer. After saturation with 1 Ag of human IgG/105 cells, cells were
incubated for 20 min on ice with phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled antibodies
specific for human CXCR4 (R&D Systems) or isotype control antibody. After
incubation, unreacted antibody was removed by washing cells twice in PBS
buffer. Cells resuspended in PBS were analyzed on a FACSCalibur cytofluorimeter using the CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). Analyses were
performed in triplicate. In each analysis, a total of 104 events were calculated.
Cell proliferation. S-phase entry was evaluated by bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdUrd) incorporation and indirect immunofluorescence. Cells were grown
on coverslips, kept in 2.5% serum for 24 h, and then treated with
recombinant SDF-1a (100 ng/mL) for 48 h. BrdUrd was added at a
concentration of 10 Amol/L for the last 1 h. Subsequently, cells were fixed in
3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. BrdUrdpositive cells were revealed with Texas red–conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Cell nuclei were
identified by Hoechst staining. Fluorescence was visualized with a Zeiss 140
epifluorescent microscope.
For growth curves, cells were plated at a density of 0.5  105 in lowserum conditions (2.5%) and counted at the indicated time points.
RNA interference. Small inhibitor duplex RNAs targeting human CXCR4
have been described previously and were chemically synthesized by Proligo.
Sense strand for human CXCR4 small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting was
the following: 5¶-GAGGGGAUCAGCAGUAUAUAC-3¶.
Small duplex RNAs containing the same nucleotides, but in scrambled
fashion (siRNA SCR), were used as a negative control. For siRNA transfection,
ATC cells were grown under standard conditions. The day before
transfection, cells were plated in six-well dishes at 50% to 60% confluency.
Transfection was performed using 5 to 15 Ag of duplex RNA and 6 AL of
Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested at 48 and 72 h after
transfection and analyzed for protein expression and biological activity.
Xenografts in nude mice. Mice were housed in barrier facilities and
12-h light-dark cycles and received food and water ad libitum at the
Dipartimento di Biologia e Patologia Cellulare e Molecolare (University of
Naples ‘‘Federico II’’, Naples, Italy). This study was conducted in accordance
with Italian regulations for experimentation on animals. All manipulations
were performed while mice were under isoflurane gas anesthesia. No mouse

showed signs of wasting or other signs of toxicity. BHT101, ARO, or KAT4
cells (5  106 per mouse) were inoculated s.c. into the right dorsal portion
of 4-week-old male BALB/c nu/nu mice (The Jackson Laboratory). When
tumors measured 40 mm3, mice were randomized to receive AMD3100
(n = 10; 1.25 mg/kg/twice daily) or vehicle alone (n = 10; PBS) by i.p.
injection for 5 consecutive days per week for 3 to 4 weeks. Tumor diameters
were measured at regular intervals with calipers. Tumor volumes (V ) were
calculated with the following formula: V = A  B 2 / 2 (A = axial diameter;
B = rotational diameter). Tumors were excised and fixed overnight in
neutral buffered formalin and processed by routine methods.
Statistical analysis. To compare CXCR4 mRNA levels in normal thyroid
tissues versus ATC samples, we used the Mann-Whitney nonparametric test
and the GraphPad Instat software, v.3.0b. To compare ATC xenograft
growth in AMD3100-treated versus untreated animals, we used the
unpaired Student’s t test (normal distributions and equal variances) and
the GraphPad Instat software, v.3.0b. All P values were two sided, and
differences were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05.

Results
CXCR4 is overexpressed in surgical samples of human ATC.
We compared CXCR4 mRNA levels in a set of ATC samples (n = 13)

versus different samples of normal thyroid tissue (n = 6). As shown
in Fig. 1A, CXCR4 mRNA was found to be up-regulated in most of
the tumor samples (10 of 13). When we performed statistical
analysis, the differences in the expression levels of CXCR4 between
tumors and normal thyroid tissues were statistically significant
(P = 0.0084; Fig. 1A).
To verify whether CXCR4 mRNA overexpression resulted in an
increase in the protein levels, we used protein extracts from a
different set of ATC samples and three normal thyroid tissues in an
immunoblot experiment with CXCR4-specific antibodies. As shown
in Fig. 1B, CXCR4 protein levels were higher in ATC samples than
in normal thyroid. As a positive control for CXCR4 expression, the
ATC cell line ARO was used.
Finally, CXCR4 antibodies were used in immunohistochemical
experiments. We evaluated CXCR4 expression in normal thyroid
tissues and a set of ATC samples (n = 33). Whereas no CXCR4
expression was detected in normal thyroid tissues, 13 (39%) of the
ATC samples scored positive for CXCR4. A representative CXCR4
immunostaining is shown in Fig. 1C. These data indicate that a
significant fraction of human ATCs, similarly to other epithelial

results was plotted on the diagram. P value was calculated with the two-tailed, nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. B, protein lysates (100 Ag) extracted from the
indicated samples underwent Western blotting with anti-CXCR4-specific antibodies. Immunocomplexes were revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Equal protein
loading was ascertained by anti-tubulin immunoblot. C, immunohistochemical staining for CXCR4 of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded ATCs. Tissue samples from
normal thyroid or ATC were incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-CXCR4 antibody. ATCs show a strong immunoreactivity for CXCR4, whereas normal thyroid
tissue is negative. Representative pictures of normal and pathologic positive samples are shown. Isotype control was also performed (data not shown). D, the
expression levels of CXCR4 protein were analyzed in thyroid tumor samples from transgenic mice models. Tumor tissues were snap frozen and immediately
homogenized by using the Mixer Mill apparatus in lysis buffer. Equal amounts of proteins were immunoblotted and stained with anti-CXCR4 polyclonal antibodies
(Abcam). ATC-like samples displayed a more intense immunoreactivity for CXCR4. As a control for equal loading, the anti-a-tubulin monoclonal antibody was used.

cancers, features high expression levels of the CXCR4 receptor.
Furthermore, they suggest that the increase in CXCR4 levels occurs
at the transcriptional level.
CXCR4 is highly expressed in animal models of ATC. Several
transgenic mice model of thyroid cancer have been developed by
using various oncogenes under the transcriptional control of the
thyroid-specific thyroglobulin bovine promoter. Depending on the
specific transgene, these mice develop carcinomas that resemble,
for cytologic and histologic features, human PTC, FTC, or ATC.
In particular, mice expressing either RET/PTC3 (TGPTC3) or
TRK/T1 (TGTRK) oncogene develop PTC-like tumors (27, 28).
NRAS transgene expression results in follicular tumors that
progress to poorly differentiated carcinomas (TGNRAS; ref. 29).
Finally, animals expressing the SV40 large T antigen (TGSV) present
aggressive thyroid cancer with features similar to human ATC (30).
To evaluate the expression of CXCR4 in these animal models, we
extracted proteins from different tumor samples of the different
transgenic lines and performed Western blot analysis with CXCR4
antibodies. Histologic diagnosis of the thyroid lesions was verified
before processing of the samples. As shown in Fig. 1D, CXCR4

levels were higher in ATC models than in normal mouse thyroid
tissue. PTC samples displayed intermediate levels of CXCR4. These
data, together with previously published data (21, 22), suggest that
CXCR4 up-regulation is a frequent event in thyroid tumorigenesis
and that it correlates with the malignancy of the disease.
CXCR4 is a functional receptor in human ATC cells. To study
the role of CXCR4 in human ATC, we first needed to identify a
suitable cell model. To this aim, various normal thyroid and ATCderived primary cultures and continuous cell lines were tested for
CXCR4 expression by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A
and B, whereas normal thyroid cultures displayed low or undetectable CXCR4 expression levels, several ATC cell lines featured
high levels of the CXCR4 receptor. In particular, of 10 ATC cell
lines, 7 displayed high expression levels of CXCR4. In the case of
ATC cells, the increased levels of CXCR4 proteins were associated
to an increase in CXCR4 mRNA levels as assessed by quantitative
PCR analysis (Fig. 2C). We then asked whether this receptor was
expressed on the cell surface. To this aim, we performed flow
cytometry experiments using a PE-conjugated mouse monoclonal
anti-CXCR4 antibody. The percentage of CXCR4-positive cells was

Figure 2. A, CXCR4 up-regulation in cell lines derived from human thyroid carcinomas was evaluated by immunoblot with a polyclonal anti-CXCR4 antibody.
The expression levels of CXCR4 protein were analyzed in the P5 human primary thyroid cells, and in the indicated cell lines derived from human PTCs (NIM, TPC1,
FB2, and NPA) or from human ATCs (8505C, ARO, CAL62, BHT101, FRO, and FB1). B, ATC-derived (S11T, S77T, S14T, HTU8 and ARO) and normal thyroid
primary cultures (P5) were screened for CXCR4 expression by Western blot analysis with the polyclonal anti-CXCR4 antibody. As a control for equal loading, the
anti-a-tubulin monoclonal antibody was used. C, expression levels of CXCR4 in human ATC cells versus the P5 normal thyroid culture were evaluated by real-time
RT-PCR analysis. CXCR4 expression levels of ATC cell lines (Y axis ) are calculated relative to the expression level in the normal human cell culture P5. All
experiments were performed in triplicate, and the average value of the results was plotted on the diagram. SDs were smaller than 25% in all cases (data not shown).

determined. As shown in Fig. 2D, CXCR4 was expressed in almost
all the ATC cell lines tested, with the exception of the FB1 cells. The
ARO cells, which in a previous report were shown to feature high
CXCR4 levels (21), were included as a positive control. In contrast,
normal thyroid cells did not express CXCR4 (data not shown).
SDF-1, the CXCR4 ligand, was not expressed by ATC cells as
assessed by quantitative PCR or ELISA assay (data not shown).
We selected two cell lines, S11T and BHT101, for further
experiments. First, we tested the ability of recombinant SDF-1a to
stimulate signal transduction in ATC cells. It has been previously
reported that stimulation of CXCR4 induces the activation of
several kinase cascades mainly through the activation of the Ghg
subunit of the Gi protein (31, 32). We therefore tested the
phosphorylation of two downstream effectors, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and AKT, using phosphorylatedspecific antibodies. To this aim, cells were serum starved for 12 h
and then stimulated with SDF-1a for different time points. As
shown in Fig. 3A and B, SDF-1a induced rapid and sustained
activation of ERK1/2 in both cell lines. AKT activation was also
achieved in BHT101 cells on SDF-1a treatment, whereas it was less
evident in S11T cells. Together, these data indicate that CXCR4 is
functional in ATC cells. Activation of ERK1/2 and AKT was
observed in virtually all the ATC cell lines expressing CXCR4,
whereas normal thyroid cells, which do not express CXCR4, did not
display these effects (data not shown).
Biological activity of CXCR4 in ATC cells. To further test the
functional responsiveness of CXCR4 in ATC, we stimulated these
cells with SDF-1a and evaluated its ability to induce cell
proliferation. To this aim, BHT101 and S11T cells were maintained
in low-serum (2.5%) growth conditions for 24 h and then either left
untreated or stimulated with SDF-1a for 12 h. As a measure of DNA
synthesis, we counted BrdUrd-positive cells on a 1-h BrdUrd pulse.
As shown in Fig. 4, SDF-1a consistently enhanced DNA synthesis in
both BHT101 and S11T cells. We then used a specific CXCR4
inhibitor, AMD3100, to block this effect. AMD3100 is a competitive
antagonist of SDF-1a, but it also displays partial agonist activity
(33). Normal thyroid cells were insensitive to SDF-1a stimulation
and to the effect of AMD3100 (data not shown). As shown in
Fig. 4A, AMD3100 inhibited SDF-1a–mediated BrdUrd incorporation in ATC cells. The positive effect of SDF-1 on cell proliferation,
measured as S-phase entry, was also observed in other ATC cell
lines (Fig. 5C). To evaluate whether SDF-1a could stimulate ATC
cell growth, we also performed growth curves in low-serum (2.5%)
conditions. As shown in Fig. 4B, the stimulation of BHT101 with

www.aacrjournals.org

SDF-1a increased their proliferation rate, and AMD3100 reverted
this effect. SDF-1a was also able to increase the proliferation rate
of three different ATC cell lines, KAT4, CAL62, and ARO, which
express CXCR4, but was unable to do so on FB1 cells, which we
previously reported to be devoid of CXCR4 (Fig. 4B). AMD3100
alone did not have any effect on ATC cells (data not shown).
To exclude off-target effects of AMD3100 and to directly
determine the role of CXCR4 on ATC cell proliferation, we used
small duplex RNA oligos to knock down CXCR4. CXCR4 RNA
interference was verified by Western blot analysis in BHT101 cells
(Fig. 5A). We then transfected CXCR4 siRNAs into BHT101, KAT4,
CAL62, and 8505C cells. CXCR4 silencing substantially impaired
SDF-1a–induced S-phase entry in all the ATC cells but had no
effect on BrdUrd incorporation in the absence of the chemokine, as
shown in Fig. 5. When we used the control scrambled siRNA, this
inhibitory effect was not observed. Furthermore, scrambled oligos
had no effect on CXCR4 protein levels (Fig. 5A).
AMD3100 inhibits ATC tumor formation in nude mice. It has
been previously shown that the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis plays an
important role in the growth and in the metastatic ability of
several epithelial cancers (20). Because we had shown that CXCR4
inhibition blocked SDF-1a–mediated ATC cell growth in culture,
and because it has been shown that this chemokine is secreted by
stromal tumoral cells (34), we reasoned that SDF-1a-CXCR4 axis
blockade by AMD3100 might inhibit ATC tumor growth. To this
aim, we selected BHT101, ARO, and KAT4 cells for their ability to
respond to SDF-1a and their ability to form tumors in vivo with
high efficiency. Nude mice were injected s.c. with 5  106 cells.
When tumors measured f40 mm3, mice (n = 20 for each cell line)
were randomized to receive AMD3100 (1.25 mg/kg/twice daily
i.p.) or vehicle 5 days per week for 3 to 4 weeks. Tumor diameters
were measured at regular intervals with caliper. After 21 days, the
mean volume of BHT101 tumors in mice treated with AMD3100
was 48 mm3, whereas that of mice treated with vehicle was
620 mm3. Representative experiments are shown in Fig. 6A and B.
Tumors induced by ARO and KAT4 reached the volume of 40 mm3
in only 1 week. In addition, in this case, AMD3100 was able to
inhibit tumor growth, although to a lesser extent. In fact, AROinduced tumor mean volume at the end of treatment with
AMD3100 was 220 mm3, whereas that of mice treated with vehicle
was 625 mm3. Similar results were also obtained when KAT4 cells
were used. In this case, the difference between the mean volume
of AMD3100-treated versus vehicle-treated tumors was not
statistically significant after 3 weeks. However, when treatment

was extended for 1 additional week, AMD3100-treated tumor mean
volume was 180 mm3, whereas that of mice treated with vehicle
was 690 mm3, and the P value was 0.039 (Fig. 6A). These data,
taken together, show that treatment with AMD3100 strongly inhibits ATC tumor growth.

Discussion
Despite ATC is a rare disease, it is one of the most aggressive
human cancers (9). Although various therapeutic strategies have
been exploited to slow down the growth of this tumor, none of

these treatments improved survival (10). The molecular pathways
implicated in this disease are poorly understood, and this hampers
the application of novel rational therapeutic strategies. Genetic
alterations found in ATC are inactivating mutations of the p53
tumor suppressor and activating mutations of b-catenin, RAS,
BRAF, and PIK3CA (11). Recently, molecular genetic alterations of
FHIT have been also detected in ATC (35). Among the genes
involved in ATC, BRAF serine-threonine kinase has been exploited
as a potential therapeutic target (23).
Most epithelial cancers feature high levels of expression of the
chemokine receptor CXCR4 (20). This receptor has been widely

CXCR4 Is Overexpressed and Functionally Relevant in ATC

Figure 5. A, CXCR4 RNA interference was used to transiently suppress CXCR4 expression in BHT101 cells. BHT101 cells were transfected with siRNAs against
CXCR4 (siRNA CXCR4) or control nonspecific small duplex RNA containing the same nucleotides, but in scrambled fashion (siRNA SCR ), and harvested
48 and 72 h later. Protein lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-CXCR4 and anti-tubulin antibodies. Control siRNA did not affect CXCR4 protein levels.
B, CXCR4 RNA interference (siRNA CXCR4 ) in BHT101 cells inhibited SDF-1a–stimulated S-phase entry as evaluated by BrdUrd incorporation assay. Control
siRNA (siRNA SCR ) did not inhibit DNA synthesis. Unstimulated BHT101 cells were not affected by siRNA transfection. C, CXCR4 RNA interference (siRNA CXCR4 )
inhibited S-phase entry in SDF-1a–stimulated KAT4, CAL62, and 8505C. ATC cells were transfected with siRNAs against CXCR4 (siRNA CXCR4 ) or control
siRNA (siRNA SCR ) and harvested 48 h later. Control siRNA did not inhibit DNA synthesis. Unstimulated cells were not affected by siRNA transfection.

studied because its expression contributes to several phenotypes of
cancer cells, such as the ability to grow, survive, and spread
throughout the body. On the contrary, most epithelial cancers do
not express SDF-1, the unique CXCR4 ligand, whereas SDF-1 is
produced in high amounts in specific body districts. It has been
suggested that the role of this chemokine in cancer is mainly to
attract cancer cells to these districts (18). In support of this
hypothesis, it has been shown that SDF-1 is produced in several
metastatic sites. Recently, it has also been suggested that tumoral
stroma secretes high amounts of SDF-1, supporting the concept
that this chemokine is pivotal in sustaining local protumorigenic
events, such as growth and survival of cancer cells (34). Furthermore, the expression of SDF-1 by stromal cancer cells directly
recruits endothelial progenitors that are required for tumor
angiogenesis (19). As most epithelial and hematopoietic malignancies, also thyroid cancer expresses high levels of CXCR4.

We previously reported functional expression of CXCR4 in
human papillary thyroid cancer (22). Furthermore, Hwang et al.
(21) showed that an anaplastic cell line, ARO, expressed high levels
of functional CXCR4. In this report, we analyzed human ATC
samples for CXCR4 expression. We also screened a large panel of
human ATC established and primary cell cultures for CXCR4
expression. We show that, both at the mRNA and at the protein
level, this receptor is overexpressed in ATC with respect to normal
thyroid samples. In contrast, SDF-1 was not detected. The
molecular mechanisms underlying CXCR4 up-regulation in ATC
are currently unknown. Because we had previously shown that
CXCR4 expression was under the control of the RET/PTC-RASBRAF-ERK pathway in PTCs (22), and because this pathway is also
activated in ATC, we asked whether CXCR4 expression correlated
with the BRAF status in ATC. The ATC cell lines that we used in
this study had been previously characterized for BRAF mutations.

Figure 6. A, antitumorigenic effects of AMD3100 in ATC cell xenografts.
BHT101, ARO, and KAT4 cells (5  106 per mouse) were injected s.c. into the
right dorsal portion of BALB/c athymic mice. When tumors measured 40 mm3,
mice were randomized to two groups (10 mice per group) to receive AMD3100 or
vehicle (PBS) by i.p. injection. Treatment was given for 5 consecutive days per
week for 3 to 4 wk (day 1 is the treatment starting day). Tumor diameters
were measured with calipers and tumor volumes were calculated. Unpaired
Student’s t test (normal distributions and equal variances) was applied. All
P values were two sided, and differences were statistically significant at
P < 0.05. B, tumors were excised and photographed. Two representative
examples of BHT101 xenografts are shown.

Furthermore, human ATC samples were screened for the presence
of BRAF mutations.6 We found that most of the samples expressed
CXCR4, and this expression was present in both the BRAF-positive
and in the BRAF-negative tumors and cell lines. These data suggest
that CXCR4 up-regulation in ATC is not necessarily linked to the
BRAF pathway and that it can be possibly achieved through
different mechanisms. The mechanisms of CXCR4 up-regulation in
cancer thus far described are various and complex. It has been
shown that nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) positively regulates the
expression of CXCR4 (36) in breast cancer cells. Interestingly,
NF-nB is activated in human thyroid cancer cells (37, 38).
Transduction of human thyroid cancer cells with the mutant
BRAF(V600E) allele induced an increase in NF-nB DNA-binding
activity (39). Thus, it is possible that CXCR4 expression in ATC is
sustained by high NF-nB activity, which can be the result either of
BRAF activation or of the activation of other still undiscovered
pathways.
We also show that the CXCR4 expressed on the ATC cell surface
is able to transduce biochemical signals into the cell. Indeed,
stimulation of ATC cells with recombinant human SDF-1a
activated ERK1/2 and, less consistently, AKT pathways in ATC
cells. Moreover, we found that SDF-1a stimulated cell growth of
different ATC cell cultures, which was inhibited by the small
CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100. Given the high rate of mortality of this
cancer and the lack of effective therapies, we focused our efforts in
the identification of novel potential therapeutic targets in ATC. We
found that the treatment with AMD3100 significantly suppressed
the development of tumors in different xenograft models of ATC
cells in nude mice.
The more dramatic biological effects of CXCR4 inhibition
observed in the animals with respect with those observed in cell
culture could be explained by the fact that SDF-1 can act, in
tumor microenvironment, at multiple levels. Indeed, tumoral
stromal cells, such as fibroblasts and bone marrow–derived cells,
express high levels of SDF-1 (34), which can directly enhance the
growth of epithelial tumoral cells and can recruit endothelial
progenitors, thus favoring angiogenesis. However, when we
analyzed xenograft tumors for CD31-positive tumor capillaries,
we found that there were no differences in vessel density of
AMD3100-treated versus untreated tumors. Preliminary data
suggest that AMD3100 activity in xenografts correlates better
with a proapoptotic than with an antiproliferative activity.7 Our
findings are in accord with previous reports about the use of
CXCR4 inhibitors in brain tumor models (40, 41). Although
treatment of ATC xenografts with AMD3100 did not induce a
complete regression of tumors, we observed a strong reduction in
growth rate, which was more dramatic in the case of BHT101
xenografts. It is conceivable that the combination of conventional
anticancer therapies with CXCR4 targeting would display a
stronger antineoplastic effect. Given the strong antitumor activity
of AMD3100, newer-generation compounds have been developed,
such as AMD3465. This compound differs from the bicyclam
AMD3100 in that it is a monocyclam endowed with greater
solubility in water, higher affinity for CXCR4, and a potent
antitumor activity (41). Although these compounds are effective in
inhibiting various cancers, long-term sustained dosing of

AMD3100 displayed a certain toxicity (42). For this reason, further
studies, aimed at understanding the effects of long-term
administration of CXCR4 inhibitors, must be pursued. Despite
these considerations, our data, together with several other reports,
strongly indicate that the inhibition of this pathway should be
actively evaluated as a novel anticancer therapy.
In conclusion, in this report, we identify CXCR4 as another
potential target of ATC anticancer therapy and suggest that
AMD3100, or other specific CXCR4 inhibitors, should be developed
and tested for the therapy of human ATC.
