ABSTRACT
Background: Acute radiation-induced liver injury is a limitation for hepatoma
radiotherapy. Come so far the clinical treatments are insufficient. The effective,
specific, low toxicity and novel drugs are in powerful need. Glibenclamide is a
common hypoglycemic. Some studies have revealed its relation with intracellular
reactive oxygen species, the crucial mediator to radiation injury. This study is aimed
to investigate if glibenclamide could act on the acute radiation-induced liver injury.
Results: Glibenclamide mitigated acute radiation-induced liver injury of mice,
indicating as regression of hepatocellular edema, reduction of hepatic sinusoid,
decline in serum ALP level and reduction of hepatocellular apoptosis. Pretreatment
of glibenclamide reduced the radiosensitivity of NCTC-1469 cells. In mechanism,
glibenclamide elevated cells membrane potential to up-regulate intracellular reactive
oxygen species. The increased reactive oxygen species subsequently activated Akt—
NF-κB pathway to promote survival of irradiated cells.
Methods: BALB/C male mice were intraperitoneal injected with glibenclamide 1
hour before hepatic irradiation. At designed time points the livers were taken to make
histological study and bloods were collected to measure serum transaminase. With/
without glibenclamide pretreatment the irradiated NCTC-1469 cells were tested apoptosis,
viability and proliferation. By western blotting the involved molecules were detected.
Conclusions: Glibenclamide, prevents acute radiation-induced liver injury of mice
via up-regulating intracellular reactive oxygen species and subsequently activating
Akt–NF-κB pathway.

hepatic carcinoma more prevalent [1, 2]. However inevitable
radiation injury to liver is still the largest challenge to
radiotherapy [3]. Radiation-induced liver injury is a common
radiation injury in liver, which usually occurs in the early
stage of radiation and is characterized by anicteric ascites and
elevation in liver enzymes [4].

Usually acute radiation-induced liver injury could
remit itself within several weeks, but sometimes it could
deteriorate and develop to lethal liver failure [5]. Come
so far the clinical therapeutics for acute radiation-induced
liver injury mainly includes steroid and some antioxidant.
Side effects and lack of specificity are the limitations of
these drugs. Therefore effective, specific, less toxicity and
novel drug is in powerful need.
In mechanism Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is
generally believed as the crucial mediator to radiation injury,
which subsequently damages biomacromolecules such as
DNA and proteins [6]. Thus targeting ROS is considered to
be an effective strategy for ameliorating radiation injury.
Glibenclamide is a common drug for diabetes
mellitus since its production in 1957 [7]. Glibenclamide
could block the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP
channel) to induce the Ca2+ influx and subsequently
promote release of insulin so that regulate the blood sugar
level [7]. Recent studies have demonstrated that KATP
channel, especially the mitochondrial membrane ATPsensitive potassium channel (mKATP channel) is associated
with generation of intracellular ROS and that is to say,
glibenclamide may play a regulated role in generation of
intracellular ROS [8, 9]. However its exact effect remains
controversial. Some studies showed an elevated ROS
from glibenclamide [10] but some reports opposites this
conclusion [11]. At all events, by targeting KATP channel
glibenclamide indeed regulates intracellular ROS level.
As liver is the one of the few tissues that highly
expressed KATP channel, then we hypothesized that
glibenclamide could influence acute radiation-induced
liver injury by regulating ROS. Herein we made a study
to investigate this effect and further to lucubrate involved
mechanism. More meaningfully, as glibenclamide is a
common hypoglycemic, its low toxicity is explicit. Hence
if glibenclamide influence acute radiation-induced liver
injury then it would be potential in clinical application.

liver injury and then the serum ALT, AST level were detected
after irradiation. Besides, total bilirubin (T-Bil) and alkaline
phosphatase (ALP) were also measured to assess the liver
function. Results demonstrated a slight elevation of ALT
(Control group: 20.6±3.2 VS IR group: 41±18.0; P=0.037)
and AST (Control group: 54.4±7.3 VS IR group: 91.8±33.9;
P=0.042) on the first day after irradiation, and thereafter
back to normal level (Figure 1C, 1D). Serum T-Bil level
didn’t reveal significantly change after irradiation (Figure
1E). However the serum ALP level rose after irradiation and
peaked (Control group: 54±4.6 VS IR group: 118.2±39.2;
P=0.0066) on the third day (Figure 1F). These results are in
line with previous studies concerning acute radiation-induced
liver disease which described an isolated elevation in alkaline
phosphatase out of proportion to other liver enzymes [3–4].

Glibenclamide mitigated acute radiation-induced
liver injury of mice
1 hour before irradiation, BABL/C mice received
intraperitoneal injection of glibenclamide (10mg/kg). On the
designed time (Day 1, 3, 5) mice livers were taken to make
histopathological analysis by H&E staining and bloods
were collected to measure serum ALP level. Besides the
specimens taken on Day 3 were detected apoptosis by dUTP
nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay and electron microscopic
scan. As a result, the advanced injection of glibenclamide
mitigated acute radiation-induced liver injury, presenting
as regression of hepatocellular vacuolation (Figure 2A,
2C) and decline in ALP level (Figure 2E). TUNEL was
expressed significantly more often in the IR group (Control
group: 5.3±2.5% VS IR group: 78.3±9.5%; P<0.001) but
decreased in the IR+Gli group (IR+Gli group: 47.3±9.1%
VS IR group: 78.3±9.5%; P=0.015) (Figure 2B, 2D). With
electron microscopic the irradiated hepatocyte presented as
cytoplasmic degradation, increased lacuna of karyotheca
and chromatic pyknosis. Meanwhile glibenclamide
improved above lesion (Figure 2F).

Glibenclamide reduced radiosensitivity of mice
hepatocyte

Establishment of acute radiation-induced liver
injury model of mice

Since the protective effect of glibenclamide on
irradiated hepatic tissue had been verified, we next
investigated if there is as well same effect on hepatocyte.
The NCTC-1469 cells, a type of normal liver cell line form
mice (ATCC), were adopted in cell experiments. Firstly
the toxicity test of glibenclamide was conducted. NCTC1469 cells were pre-treated with different concentration
of glibenclamide for 1 hour. Then cells viability was
tested 24 hours later. As a result, cells viability decreased
significantly at 500μM (Figure 3A; P<0.05). Accordingly
100μM of glibenclamide was selected as optimum
concentration for subsequent experiments. Next we
detected cell viability, potential of proliferation and
apoptosis to evaluate cells radiosensitivity.

Hepatic regions of BABL/C mice were irradiated at
a single dose of 30 Gy. At designed time (Day1, 3, 5) livers
were taken to make histopathological study by H&E staining.
Bloods were collected to measure serum glutamic-pyruvic
transaminase (ALT), glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (AST),
total bilirubin (T-Bil) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level
respectively. Histologically there was extensive hepatocellular
edema surrounding sublobular veins and local erythrocyte
exudation under venous endodermis after irradiation, which
was characterized by poorly defined cytoplasmic space and
clear space within hepatocytes. Notably the most severe
edema occurred on the third day after irradiation (Figure 1A,
1B). Serum levels of transaminases are common index of

Cell viability and potential of proliferation were
determined by CCK-8 assay and colony forming
assay respectively. Upon different dose of IR the cells
viability and colony forming rate decreased, meanwhile
1h pretreatment of glibenclamide partly rescued this
reduction (Figure 3B, 3C, 3D, and 3E). Cell apoptosis
rate is an important indicator for radiosensitivity because
apoptosis is the main type of cell death under irradiation
[14, 15]. In this study cells apoptosis rate were evaluated
by Hoechst33342 staining and flow cytometry. IR dose
and test time selection were based on the result in Figure
3B and Figure 3C that 48h after 8Gy of irradiation
cells were detected apoptosis. Consequently irradiated
NCTC-1469 cells were stained with extensively
high-intensity of Hoechst33342, which indicated
cell apoptosis due to pyknosis of nucleus. In contrast
glibenclamide pretreatment significantly reduced the sum
of high-intensity cells (positive rate of Heochst33342:
67.0±10.5% VS 36.3±3.5%; P=0.008; Figure 3F,
3G). Results of flow cytometry also demonstrated the
remission of glibenclamide in radiation-induced apoptosis
(apoptosis rate: 30.7±3.8% VS 15.4±4.1%; P<0.001;
Figure 3H, 3I)

Membrane potential (MP), especially the
mitochondrial transmerabrane potential (MMP) is
well known to regulate intracellular ROS level and is
regulated by KATP [17, 18]. Thus MP was further detected
by DiBAC4(3) staining. Consequently glibenclamide
significantly increased intracellular membrane potential
(MP) (2164.45±184.30 VS 469.60±88.32; P<0.001; Figure
4C, 4E).

Glibenclamide activated Akt—NF-κB pathway
via up-regulating ROS
Unexpectedly glibenclamide was verified to upregulate intracellular ROS level. As ROS is the crucial
mediator to radiation injury[6], we originally hypothesize
that glibenclamide should reduce ROS to protect
hepatocyte from radiation. Despite this perplexing result,
some studies, indeed have reported that modest ROS could
induce Akt and NF-κB activation to enhance cells survival
[25–28]. Therefore we speculated that pre-treatment of
glibenclamide might moderately up-regulate intracellular
ROS level and subsequently activate Akt—NF-κB
pathway to enhance hepatocyte survival against radiation.
Firstly the relation between glibenclamide and
activation of Akt—NF-κB pathway was investigated.
Western blotting analysis manifested that glibenclamide
phosphorylated Akt at 473 locus rather than 308 locus and
reached the peak at 1 hour (Figure 5A, 5B). In the meantime
IκB degraded (Figure 5A, 5C) and p65 transferred into cell
nucleus (Figure 5D). These results confirmed an activation
of Akt—NF-κB pathway form glibenclamide. Previous
results (Figure 4) demonstrated that glibenclamide could
elevate MP and subsequently up-regulated ROS level. In
order to verify that the activated effect of glibenclamide
on Akt—NF-κB pathway is due to increased ROS, we
applied the N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a specific scavenger
for ROS. As a result NAC eliminated ROS (Figure 5E, 5F)
and simultaneously inhibited the activation of Akt—NF-κB
pathway from glibenclamide (Figure 5G, 5H).

Glibenclamide elevated membrane potential
(MP) and activated reactive oxygen species
(ROS)
Except for the simulative effect on secretion of
insulin, ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP), the
target of glibenclamide is also found to be associated
with oxidative stress and generation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) though the exact conclusion remains to be
controversial[11–12]. On the other hand increased ROS is
generally taken for the main mediator to irradiation injury
[16]. Thus in next study, we investigated if the protective
effect of glibenclamide is associated with KATP and
intracellular ROS. Firstly we verified the exact expression
of KATP in hepatic tissue and other tissues. Results of
immunohistochemical and western-blotting confirmed that
KATP highly expressed in brain, muscle and liver tissues.
In addition higher expression in Kir6.1 than Kir6.2 was
observed in hepatic tissue of mice (Figure 4A, 4B).
Intracellular ROS level was detected by Reactive
Oxygen Species Fluorogenic Probe and was observed
with confocal microscopy. Besides, the content of MDA
and activation of antioxidant enzyme including GSH,
SOD were also tested. As a result glibenclamide group
had higher flsorescence intensity (1530.28±413.26 VS
209.99±44.29; P<0.001; Figure 4D, 4F), increased
content of MDA (0.81±0.11 VS 0.36±0.07; P<0.001;
Figure 4G), decreased activation of GSH ( 0.75±0.07 VS
1.14±0.28; P=0.019; Figure 4H) and reduced content of
SOD (12.96±1.27 VS 18.09±1.22; P<0.001; Figure 4I)
indicating that glibenclamide lead to the elevation of
intracellular ROS level.

Elimination of ROS wiped off the protective
effect of glibenclamide on irradiated
NCTC-1469 cells
Previous results had verified that glibenclamide upregulated intracellular ROS level to activate Akt—NF-κB
pathway. Given activation of Akt—NF-κB pathway has
been verified to promote cells survival [27, 28], herein
we further investigated if the up-regulation of ROS
mediated the protection of glibenclamide on irradiated
NCTC-1469 cells. By using NAC, the up-regulated ROS
induced by glibenclamide was reduced (Figure 5E, 5F),
and simultaneously eliminated the protective effect of
glibenclamide on irradiated NCTC-1469 cells (Figure 6).
Above results confirmed that glibenclamide protected
irradiated hepatocyte by activating intracellular ROS.

Effect of glibenclamide on hepatoma carcinoma
cell

glibenclamide (Figure 7C). Combining 8Gy of irradiation,
glibenclamide at 100μM rescued cell viability of L-O2 but
lead to inhibition in HepG-2 (Figure 7D). Meaningfully
when concentration of glibenclamide reached to 500μM,
both L-O2 and HepG-2 cell viability reduced significantly
than radiation alone group. In addition result of flow
cytometry also demonstrated that 100μM glibenclamide
inhibited radiation-induced apoptosis in L-O2 but
promotion in HepG-2 (Figure 7E, 7F).

Above results had confirmed that glibenclamide
remitted acute radiation-induced liver disease and reduced
radiosensitivity of hepatocyte. We then wondered the
effect of glibenclamide on hepatoma carcinoma cell.
Firstly the expression of KATP was investigated. Result of
western blotting indicated a higher expression of Kir6.1
and Kir6.2 in human hepatic cell line L-O2 than in human
hepatoma cell line HepG-2 (Figure 7A, 7B), suggesting
hepatoma carcinoma cells have less expression of KATP
than normal hepatic cells.
Secondly the toxicity of glibenclamide between
L-O2 and HepG-2 was tested. With increased concentration
of glibenclamide, cells viability of both L-O2 and HepG2 decreased. However the significant toxic concentration
was 500μM in L-O2 and 100μM in HepG-2, indicating
that hepatoma carcinoma cells were more sensitive to

DISCUSSION
With the development of radiotherapy technology
and exploitation of radioembolization the therapeutic
selection for liver cancer obtains more chances though
conventionally operative treatment has been applied for
years.
However despite the therapeutic benefit, radiation
induced liver disease (RILD) has become a rising concern.

Generally, RILD contains two types, classical (patients
without underlying liver disease) and nonclassical
(patients with underlying liver disease). Patients with
classical RILD presents as isolated elevation of alkaline
phosphatase out of proportion to other liver enzymes, in
contrast non-classical RILD is characterized as jaundice
and markedly elevated serum transaminase [4, 12]. The
course of RILD is complex and multistage, including
early acute radiation-induced injury to hepatocyte and
late fibrosis in interstitial tissue [19, 20]. In the early
stage radiation leads to cells damage by directly breaking

DNA strands and indirectly elevating reactive oxygen
species (ROS) level [16]. The increased ROS extensively
binds and damages biomacromolecules such as proteins
and nucleic acid, which consequently leads to cellular
death. On the other hand radiation could also stimulate
immune cells and promote release of inflammatory
factors including TGF-β, IL-6 and TNF-α. The
activation of inflammatory response promotes fibroblasts
transformation so that finally brings to hepatic fibrosis in
the late stage [5]. Due to the great regenerative ability of
hepatocyte, hepatic fibrosis is clinically seldom to occur

but acute hepatic injury often cause severe outcome.
In addition early acute hepatic injury is considered as
central role in the development of RILD [20]. Therefore
early hepatocyte protection is crucial for RILD therapy.
Due to the complicacy of pathogenesis and fierceness of

irradiation there is no effective and specific pharmacologic
therapy for acute radiation induced-liver injury.
Glibenclamide is a classical and prevalent drug for
diabetes since its production in 1957 [7]. It is a consensus
that glibenclamide blocks ATP-sensitive potassium

channel (KATP) to induce the Ca2+ influx and subsequently
increased release of insulin so that regulating the blood
sugar level [7]. However recent studies demonstrated
that except induction of intracellular Ca2+ glibenclamide
regulated intracellular ROS by targeting KATP [8, 9].
Generally activation of KATP channel is believed to
reduce endogenic ROS and blocking KATPis regarded
as an approach to increase ROS [10, 21]. However
some studies come to opposite conclusion [11]. Despite
the controversy glibenclamide is indeed involved in
regulation of intracellular ROS level. As increased ROS
is the main mediator to radiation injury. We accordingly
speculated that the glibenclamide might influence the cell
radiosensitivity. Thus in this study we investigated the
effect of glibenclamide on acute radiation-induced liver
injury and irradiated hepatocyte.
Firstly the acute radiation-induced model of
BABL/C mice was established. After irradiation in
hepatic region, livers and bloods of mice were taken to test
pathology and measure serum transaminase respectively.
Interestingly, the hepatic histopathology presented an
extensively hepatocellular edema surrounding sublobular
veins and local erythrocyte exudation under venous
endodermis after irradiation but the serum transaminase
including ALT, AST didn’t indicate significantly change.
On the other hand, the serum content of ALP reached

to marked elevation after irradiation. This result is in
line with previous studies, which described an isolated
elevation in alkaline phosphatase out of proportion to
other liver enzymes [4]. It may be explained that cellular
and matrical edema are the main denaturation of acute
radiation-induced injury, which is limited to damage cells
and subsequently released transaminase into serum. Except
hepatocellular edema, the histo-pathological images also
showed sublobular veins injury. In fact the vascular
endothelial cell is more sensitive to irradiation than the
liver parenchyma cells, so some studies regarded the
vascular injury as the primary and critical link to radiationinduced liver. With the vascular injury, liver parenchyma
cells are gradually exposed to ischemic microenvironment
so that develop to edema or other lesions.
Using this acute radiation-induced liver injury
model we tested if the glibenclamide play a role. As a
result the pre-treatment of glibenclamide mitigated acute
radiation-induced liver injury of mice, which performed
as regression of hepatocellular edema and reduction of
hepatic sinusoid. To further verify this protective effect,
we then tested the effect of glibenclamide on NCTC-1469
cells, a normal liver cells line from mice. According with
in vivo results, glibenclamide could reduce the NCTC1469 cells radiosensitivity. Thus we confirmed that the
protective effect of glibenclamide on hepatic tissue and

hepatocyte. These results, to our knowledge, are firstly
reported, though glibenclamide have been applied and
studied for many years.
It was interesting and surprising that a classic drug
for diabetes mellitus might be a radioprotectant and the
mechanism involved should be researched in-depth.
Concerning the specific mechanism we focused on the
association of KATP and intracellular ROS. KATP is believed
to be associated with intracellular ROS level by affecting
membrane potential (MP) [17, 18] As glibenclamide could
specifically target KATP, so glibenclamide is speculated to
affect irradiated cells by changing intracellular ROS level
which is generally considered as the main mediator to
radiation-induced injury [6]. Unexpectedly, glibenclamide
elevated MP and subsequently increased intracellular
ROS. It is well known that radiation induced increase of
ROS to damage biomacromolecule and lead to apoptosis
[6]. We originally hypothesize that glibenclamide should
reduce ROS to protect hepatocyte from radiation. Despite
this perplexing result, some studies, indeed have reported
that moderate prestimulation of ROS could activate Akt
pathway to enhance cells survival [25–28]. Thus we
speculated that pre-treatment of glibenclamide stimulated
Akt-NF-κB pathway and it was the stimulation that could
protect cells from drastic ROS induced by radiation.
Accordantly western blotting and immunofluorescence
detection revealed that glibenclamide phosphorylated Akt as
well as promoted the transfer of p65 into cell nucleus. With
using NAC, a scavenger for ROS, the stimulated response
was eliminated. What’s more NAC also eliminated the
protective effect of glibenclamide on irradiated cells. Above
results confirmed the mediated role of ROS in the effect of
glibenclamide. The mechanism is summarized as Figure 8.
Having confirmed the protection of glibenclamide
on hepatocyte, we then wondered if glibenclamide
play a role in hepatoma carcinoma cell. Our results
demonstrated that beyond specific concentration (500μM
for L-O2, 100μM for HepG-2), glibenclamide could
exert inhibition on both L-O2 and HepG-2. This result is
accordance with other studies [22, 23] that glibenclamide
showed antitumor effect though so far there is no report
on liver cancer. However the toxic concentration of L-O2
is significantly less than HepG-2. HepG-2, as a kind of
hepatoma carcinoma cell, naturally restores high level of
intracellular ROS than normal hepatocyte [24]. Hence
HepG-2 may represent lower tolerance to glibenclamide
given glibenclamide is a source of ROS and play antitumor
effect. Combining with irradiation, low concentration of
glibenclamide (50μM) protected both L-O2 and HepG2, but at 100μM, the concentration of still protecting
L-O2 in contrast promoted radiation-induced apoptosis
of HepG-2. This result indicated the difference of applied
concentration of glibenclamide between hepatocyte
and hepatoma carcinoma cell, suggesting that at a dose
range glibenclamide may remit acute radiation-induced
liver injury as well as inhibit liver cancer. Anyway the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

exact conclusion remains to be confirmed by more welldesigned experiments in the future.
As far as we know this study is the first investigation
that revealed a protective effect of glibenclamide on acute
radiation-induced liver injury. Though the advanced
stimulation of ROS was verified as the critical mediator there
were still limitations to know if ROS could directly stimulated
Akt and specific combination mode still remained unclear.
Above all things our results indicated that glibenclamide
prevents acute radiation-induced liver injury via up-regulating
intracellular ROS and subsequently activating Akt—NF-κB
pathway. As the specific highly expression of KATP channel
in liver tissues and explicit toxicity of glibenclamide, we
suggested the clinical potential of glibenclamide in the
therapy of acute radiation-induced liver injury.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice
BALB/C male mice, 5-6 weeks of old, was from
Shanghai Ling Chang biological technology co., LTD.
Mice was kept in Specific Pathogen-Free (SPF) facility for
all experiments. All the experiments associated with mice
obtained approval of the Laboratory Animal Center of the
Second Military Medical University, Shanghai.

Cell and cell culture
NCTC1469 cells (a type of normal mice liver cell
line), L-O2 cells (human hepatic cell line) and HepG-2
(human hepatoma cell line) were from American Type
Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA (ATCC). Cells
were cultured using DMEM Medium (PAA, Austria)
containing 10% fetal calf serum (PAA, Austria) and were
incubated under 5% CO2 humidified chamber at 37°C.
Cells were observed with microscope every day and
medium was replaced intermittently. Finally the cells at
logarithmic phase were harvested to use for experiments.

Irradiation of mice liver and liver cell line
Co source in the radiation center (Faculty of Naval
Medicine, Second Military Medical University, China)
was used for irradiation. In order to confine irradiation
only in the liver of mice without damaging other tissues,
we had the leads shielded other tissues so that only the
liver was exposed to the beam. All the livers of mice
received a single dose of 30 Gy at a dose rate of 1 Gy/min.
Cell lines received a single dose of 6, 8, 12 Gy.

Biochemical analysis of mice serum
The hepatic function of mice was determined by the
serum level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP).

Electron microscopic (EM)

These measurements were made in “angel” pet hospital
in Shanghai.

Removed liver tissues of mice were fixed with 2.5%
glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.4),
followed by 1% OsO4. Slices were dehydrated and then
were stained with uranyl acetate. Finally the tissues were
observed by electron microscope.

Liver histological analysis and quantitative score
The livers of mice were taken according to study
design, and then the liver specimens were dehydrated,
embedded in paraffin and then sectioned into at least 7
slices with the thickness of 5 μm. After the slices were
dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated by exposure to graded
ethanols, tissue sections were stained with HaematoxylinEosin. Histological images were observed and were
photographed with microscope. Slides were manually
scored in a blinded fashion for degree of hepatocellular
vacuolation. The vacuolar differences, when present,
were primarily from periportal to midzonal hepatocytes;
thus, scoring was based on the average of three periportal
images per liver section. For each image, 100 hepatocytes
were counted and given a score corresponding to the
severity of the vacuolation: low, medium, or high. Low
vacuolation was characterized by mild cytoplasmic
vacuolation consistent with glycogen accumulation.
Medium to high vacuolar scores corresponded to
hepatocytes that were moderately to markedly enlarged
due to dilation of the cytoplasm by clear.
Space and poorly defined clear vacuoles [12].
Histological results had been certified by a pathologist MD
Qian Ma from Department of Pathology, Ruijin Hospital,
Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine,
Shanghai 200025, P.R. China.

CCK-8 assay and clonogenic survival
CCK-8 assay (Cell Counting Kit-8; Dojindo,
Kumamoto, Japan) is an improved method for detecting
cell viability, which is in principle similar to MTT assay.
Briefly cells were planked in the 96-well plates as the
density of 5000 cells per well before irradiation. 24 hours
after irradiation, cells were co-incubated with CCK-8
reagent. 2 hours later the OD values were measured by
microplate reader. Clonogenic survival was performed
to assess the potential of cell proliferation. Firstly cells
were planked in 6-well plate and the planked cell number
was based on the previous irradiated dose-survival curve.
After irradiation cells were continually cultured under 5%
CO2 humidified chamber at 37°C for 10 days. Finally the
clones were stained with crystal violet hydrate solution
containing 5% formaldehyde and were counted.

Measurement of intracellular GSH, SOD, MDA
and ROS level
The GSH, ROS, and MDA level of NCTC1469
cells were measured with GSH, SOD and MDA assay kit
respectively (Cat. No S0053, S0109, S0131; Beyotime;
China). The intracellular ROS was detected by Reactive
Oxygen Species Fluorogenic Probe (Cat. No S0033;
Beyotime; China) and was observed with confocal
microscopy.

TUNEL assay and evaluation
dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was
used to determine apoptosis in liver tissues. Paraffinembedded sections (3 μm thick) of liver tissues were fixed
in paraformaldehyde solution (3% in phosphate-buffered
saline [PBS], pH 7.4) for 5 min at room temperature. The
fixed sections were washed with PBS for 5 min at room
temperature and then treated with proteinase K in HCl
(0.01 N, pH 2.0) for 15 min at room temperature. Then
110 μL of the TUNEL reaction mixture was added to each
section, which was then coverslipped and incubated in a
humidified chamber at 37°C for 60 min. Subsequently, 65
μL antidigoxigenin conjugate solution was applied to each
specimen and the sections were incubated for 30 min at
room temperature. The reaction was carried out by adding
75 μL of a peroxidase substrate solution to the sections for
6 min at room temperature. The slides were washed with
PBS and mounted in 0.5% methyl green. TUNEL was
quantified by counting positive hepatocyte nuclei (brown)
per 400x field. A total of 5×400x fields were scored per
liver, and means of these scores were calculated for further
statistical analysis [13].

Western blot analysis
NCTC1469 cells and liver primary tissues were
collected after treatment. Then cells were resuspended
in PBS and washed for 3 times. Collected in extraction
buffer (1% Triton X-100,0.5% sodium deoxycholate,
20mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 12mMglycero-phosphate,
150mM NaCl, 5mM EGTA, 10mM NaF, 3mM
dithiothreitol, 1mM sodium orthovanadate, 1mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20g/ml aprotinin), cells
were incubated on ice for 3×10 minutes, and lysate was
centrifuged (12,000g for 15 minutes at 4°C) to obtain
the supernatant containing protein. Equal amount of
proteins was separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. 5% low-fat milk
was used to block the membranes for 2 hours then the
membranes were washed 3 times with TBST for 10mins.
The membranes were probed overnight at 4°C with
