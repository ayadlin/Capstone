ABSTRACT:
The efficacy of chemotherapy is often limited by side effects in normal tissues. This
is exemplified by cisplatin, a widely used anti-cancer drug that may induce serious
toxicity in normal tissues and organs including the kidneys. Decades of research
have delineated multiple signaling pathways that lead to kidney cell injury and
death during cisplatin treatment. However, the same signaling pathways may also
be activated in cancer cells and be responsible for the chemotherapeutic effects of
cisplatin in tumors and, as a result, blockade of these pathways is expected to reduce
the side effects as well as the anti-cancer efficacy. Thus, to effectively curtail the
side effects, it is imperative to elucidate and target the cell killing mechanisms that
are specific to normal (and not cancer) tissues. Our recent work identified protein
kinase C δ (PKCδ) as a new and critical mediator of cisplatin-induced kidney cell
injury and death. Importantly, inhibition of PKCδ enhanced the chemotherapeutic
effects of cisplatin in several tumor models while alleviating the side effect in
kidneys, opening a new avenue for normal tissue protection during chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

the therapeutic window of most anti-cancer agents is
very narrow[6]. As a result, the anti-cancer drugs cannot
be administered at the dosages where they can eradicate
all the cancer cells. This is in part responsible for the
selection of resistant cancer cells, ultimately leading to
growth of tumors that are refractory to subsequent anticancer therapy[6]. Although, the significance of resistance
to anti-cancer drugs has been widely recognized and
extensively studied[7, 8], the research on the mechanisms
responsible for the toxicity to normal tissues has generally
lagged far behind. The identification of molecular targets
that reduce toxicity to normal tissues without blocking
the anti-cancer effects has the potential to significantly
improve the efficacy of chemotherapy.

Cancer is the most devastating and intractable human
disease. There are numerous ways to kill cancer cells, but
most of them do not translate into cancer therapy because
they kill normal cells and tissues as well. Thus selective
and efficient targeting of cancer cells is the foremost goal
in the development of anti-cancer therapeutics[1]. Most
of the early anti-cancer therapies have some selectivity
for cancer cells by inhibiting essential process like DNA
replication and cell division in rapidly dividing cancer
cells[1]. Recently developed anti-cancer drugs often have
specific molecular targets that are deregulated in cancer
cells[2]. The critical barrier in the use of early anti-cancer
drugs is the development of resistance in cancer cells and
the severe toxicity to normal tissues[3, 4]. It was believed
that these impediments could be significantly reduced in
the new generation of drugs that target specific molecular
pathways in cancer tissues[2, 4]. However, it has been
found that the new drugs often suffer from the same
drawbacks[5].

CISPLATIN AND NEPHROTOXICITY
Cisplatin is one of the oldest, highly effective and
most commonly used anti-cancer drugs[9-11]. Cisplatin
is a platinum based inorganic compound that is believed
to cross-link DNA, leading to inhibition of essential
processes like DNA replication and transcription[11].

Higher rate of DNA replication in rapidly proliferative
cancer cells make them particularly sensitive to cisplatininduced DNA damage. Depending on the amount of
DNA damage, cancer cells either repair/tolerate the
DNA damage or undergo apoptosis in case of extensive
damage[8]. Identification of resistant cells that have higher
DNA repair or reduced DNA damage response/apoptosis
have provided the basis that DNA damage is the major
mechanism of cisplatin-induced tumor cell death[8, 12].
Along with its effectiveness in killing cancer cells,
cisplatin has a wide range of side-effects in normal tissues,
among which nephrotoxicity is most notable due to its
potentially fatal nature[13, 14]. Cisplatin treatment can
lead to severe kidney damage resulting in acute kidney
injury, which has a very high rate of mortality[14].
Extensive hydration in patients can partially reduce the
extent of kidney injury, however nephrotoxicity remains a
main threat[13, 14]. Development of novel drugs derived
from cisplatin like carboplatin and oxaloplatin have
reduced toxicity, but these drugs are not as widely effective
as cisplatin[13]. New strategies that reduce kidney injury
during cisplatin treatment could have significant impact on
the overall efficiency of chemotherapy.
Extensive studies have been conducted in the last
decade to decipher the patho-physiological basis of
cisplatin nephrotoxicity[13-17]. The major pathological
feature of cisplatin-induced kidney injury is the cell
death of renal tubular cells in the form of apoptosis and
necrosis[13]. The specific sensitivity of tubular cells to
cispatin is partly attributed to the fact that they accumulate
many-fold higher amounts of cisplatin than other cells and
tissues. Depending on the amount of cisplatin exposed,
renal tubular cells undergo necrosis or apoptosis[18].
Along with renal cell death, an inflammatory component
is also responsible for aggravating kidney injury[16,
19-22]. Injured kidney cells activate inflammatory
processes, which further increase renal cell death leading
to extensive kidney injury and acute renal failure[19].
Genetic and pharmacological strategies that inhibit both
renal apoptotic pathways and inflammation in renal
tissues provide significant protection during cisplatin
treatment[13]. Other pharmacological/natural compounds
that inhibit these processes indirectly also reduce cisplatininduced kidney injury[13]. These studies have thus
provided insight into the complex molecular mechanisms
responsible for cisplatin nephrotoxicity. At the same time,
it has been proposed that these strategies could have
potential renoprotective effects during cisplatin-based
chemotherapy.
However, the most critical issue that has not been
addressed is the effect of these protective strategies on
the anti-cancer efficacy of cisplatin. Indeed, some of
the signaling pathways, for example the DNA damage
response leading to p53 activation, observed in renal cells,
also contribute to cisplatin mediated cancer cell death[23].
Identification of targets that can reduce renal toxicity

without blocking the anti-cancer efficacy of cisplatin could
have important clinical significance.

IDENTIFICATION OF PKCΔ AS TARGET
FOR RENOPROTECTION DURING
CISPLATIN-BASED CHEMOTHERAPY
Protein kinase C (PKC) comprises of a family of
highly conserved serine/threonine kinases that influence a
wide range of cellular processes[24]. PKCδ is a member of
the novel PKC sub-family, that are activated in a calciumindependent, but diacylglycerol-dependent manner[25,
26]. PKCδ is widely expressed in multiple tissues and
has been implicated in a plethora of cellular processes
including proliferation and apoptosis[25, 27, 28].
Knockout of PKCδ does not affect have overt effects on
murine development, suggesting that PKCδ is not essential
for normal mammalian development[29].
PKCδ is not only activated by cofactors, such as
diacylglycerol and phorbol esters, but its activation is also
dependent on post-translational modifications, especially
phosphorylation[29]. Several tyrosine kinases, including
growth factor receptors, Src family tyrosine kinases and
c-Abl, have been implicated in PKCδ phosphorylation[29].
In addition PKCδ can be cleaved by caspases to generate
a constitutively active catalytic fragment[25]. Numerous
studies have thus implicated PKCδ activation as a proapoptotic mechanism during various stimuli, including
treatment with anti-cancer agents[29]. Intriguingly, PKCδ
can also function as an anti-apoptotic factor and confer
resistance to anticancer drugs. Furthermore, PKCδ is prosurvival factor in several cancers[29]. Thus, depending
on the treatment and cellular context, PKCδ may play
contrasting roles in the decision of cell death or survival.
The mechanisms underlying the dual roles of PKCδ
remain unclear, but the localization, phosphorylation
status and downstream substrates may be involved.
The lack of severe phenotype of PKCδ-deficient mice
suggested that PKCδ might be dispensable for normal
development and tissue maintenance[29]. However, PKCδ
may play regulatory roles in cell stress and pathological
conditions including treatment with anti-cancer drugs.
Indeed our recent study[30] has identified a novel role
of PKCδ during cisplatin-induced kidney injury. Genetic
ablation and pharmacological inhibition of PKCδ provided
significant renal protection during cisplatin treatment
in in vitro cell cultures and in vivo murine models[30].
Mechanistically, PKCδ was shown to be activated in a
Src-dependent manner leading to downstream activation
of MAPK pathway.
While our study suggested a renal protective strategy
during cisplatin chemotherapy by targeting PKCδ, we were
however concerned that PKCδ inhibition might attenuate
the anti-cancer efficacy of cisplatin in tumors. To address
this key issue, we conducted a series of in vitro and in vivo
experiments to determine the effect of PKCδ inhibition
108

on the anti-cancer efficacy of cisplatin. Intriguingly, we
found that PKCδ inhibition did not reduce the effect of
cisplatin in cancer cells and in some cases PKCδ inhibition
actually increased the chemotherapy efficacy. Importantly,
we developed new in vivo mouse models in which both
the anti-cancer efficacy of cisplatin and its toxicity or
side effects in kidneys could be directly monitored. These
experiments demonstrated unambiguously that PKCδ
inhibition reduced cisplatin toxicity in normal tissues
without diminishing its anti-cancer effects. As a matter of
fact, in ovarian and breast tumor models, PKCδ inhibitors
enhanced the cancer therapy effect of cisplatin (Figure 1).
The observed different effects of PKCδ inhibitors
in kidneys and tumors remain enigmatic. Earlier studies
implicated a pro-apoptotic role of PKCδ in both normal
and cancer cells[29], leading to the suggestion that
PKCδ may function as a tumor suppressor. However,
direct in vivo evidence for this theory is lacking and

PKCδ-deficient mice do not display any propensity
for carcinogenesis under normal conditions. In a
recent study[31] the role of PKCδ in K-ras-dependent
lung tumorigenesis was examined by using a mouse
carcinogen model. Surprisingly, the incidence of urethaneinduced lung tumors was significantly reduced in PKCδdeficient mice compared with wild-type mice. PKCδ-KO
tumors were smaller and showed significantly reduced
proliferation. It is suggested that PKCδ may act as a
tumor promoter downstream of oncogenic K-ras during
lung carcinogenesis. Unexpectedly, these studies indicate
that the function of PKCδ in tumor cells may depend on
specific oncogenic context, as loss of PKCδ suppressed
growth only in the cells that depend on oncogenic K-ras
for proliferation and survival. Consistently, a pro-survival
role of PKCδ has been documented in several cancer cell
lines[29].
How can these seemingly contradictory findings
be reconciled? We speculate that PKCδ may not have
a critical pro-apoptotic or pro-survival role in normal
mammalian development or physiological conditions.
However, the cancer cells in some tumor types require
PKCδ for survival and proliferation. Such scenario goes
by the principle of ‘non-oncogenic addiction’[6] (Figure
1). According to this model, activation of oncogenes
and rapid proliferation in cancer cells induce a stress
phenotype that is particularly sensitive to cellular stress
[6]. As a result, the cancer cells become dependent on
certain pathways for survival, which are non-essential in
normal cells and tissues. These non-oncogenic pathways
are not important for initial cancer development, but are
critical for the survival and proliferation of cancer cells in
tumors. PKCδ seems to be a good candidate protein for
‘non-oncogenic addiction’ in cancer cells, which becomes
essential for their survival under oncogenic stresses such
as ras activation. If this is true, PKCδ could turn out to
be an important target for anti-cancer therapy. Our study
demonstrated a role of PKCδ in mediates the toxic effects
of cisplatin in the kidneys and hence inhibition of PKCδ

Our recent studies have shed light on a hitherto
under-appreciated yet important aspect of cancer therapy.
Since the side effect or toxicity to normal tissues is one
of the key determinants in the success of anti-cancer
drugs, identification of targets and development of
normal tissue protective strategies could have significant
implications in the treatment of cancer. Several strategies
have been developed to selectively kill certain types of
cancer cells, while simultaneously protecting normal cells
[32-44]. By including normal tissue specific-protective
agents in chemotherapy, these strategies may increase
the therapeutic window. In line with this idea, PKCδ has
now been demonstrated to be a critical component in
nephrotoxicity during cisplatin treatment. The fact that
PKCδ might be a “non-oncogenic addiction” factor for
cancer cell survival provides an immense opportunity
to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy by reducing
the side effect in normal tissues and increasing the anticancer effect in tumors. Studies in the future should
further elucidate the differential functions of PKCδ and
other potential ‘non-oncogenic addiction’ genes in normal
versus cancer tissues, opening new avenues to improve the
efficacy of cancer therapy.
