Abstract
Up to 50% of epithelial ovarian cancers (EOC) display defects in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway.
We sought to determine the ramiﬁcations of the homologous recombination–deﬁcient (HRD) status on the
clinicopathologic features, chemotherapy response, and survival outcomes of patients with EOCs. HR status was
determined in primary cultures from ascitic ﬂuid in 50 chemotherapy-na€ve patients by a functional RAD51
immunoﬂuorescence assay and correlated with in vitro sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor (PARPi), rucaparib. All
patients went on to receive platinum-based chemotherapy; platinum sensitivity, tumor progression, and overall
survival were compared prospectively in HR-competent versus HRD patients. Compared with HR-competent
patients, the HRD group was predominantly serous with a higher median CA125 at presentation. HRD was
associated with higher ex vivo PARPi sensitivity and clinical platinum sensitivity. Median follow-up duration was
14 months; patients in the HRD group had lower tumor progression rates at 6 months, lower overall/diseasespeciﬁc death rates at 12 months, and higher median survival. We therefore suggest that HRD as predicted by a
functional RAD51 assay correlates with in vitro PARPi sensitivity, clinical platinum sensitivity, and improved
survival outcome. Cancer Res; 72(22); 5675–82. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Approximately 10% of epithelial ovarian cancers (EOC)
have germ line mutations in BRCA1/BRCA 2 rendering them
deﬁcient in the homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair
pathway (1, 2). A majority of studies show an improved
overall and progression-free survival (PFS) compared with
non–BRCA-related sporadic EOCs (3–5). BRCAness is a term
that has been coined to describe cancers that do not
have mutations in BRCA genes but phenotypically behave
like these tumors due to genetic/epigenetic events (6). These
aberrations may render these tumors defective in HR and
therefore HR deﬁciency (HRD) would appear to be a more
appropriate terminology. It is estimated that up to 50% to
60% EOCs could be HRD; functional assays continue to be

developed to identify this subset of EOCs (7). A recent study
analyzing retrospective data showed that EOCs with BRCAness determined by gene expression proﬁling had improved
disease-free survival compared with non–BRCA-like tumors
(8). However, these data need to be conﬁrmed in prospective
studies.
There is now widespread agreement that a novel class of
anti-cancer agents, PARP inhibitors (PARPi), have activity in
BRCA-related cancers by using the inherent HR defectiveness
of the tumors in a synthetically lethal manner (9, 10). Phase I
and II clinical trials have shown good clinical beneﬁt rates with
minimal side effects in recurrent advanced-stage EOCs with
BRCA mutations (11, 12). BRCA-related tumors have also been
shown to have increased sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy compared with non–BRCA-related cancers (13).
It would appear therefore that EOCs with HRD are a subset
of tumors that have distinct clinicopathologic features, chemosensitivity, and survival proﬁles. We developed a functional
assay in primary cultures to classify EOCs based on HR status
and correlated with in vitro sensitivity to PARPi (7). All these
patients subsequently received platinum-based chemotherapy
and were followed up. In this prospective study, we aimed to
correlate HR status with chemoresponsiveness and clinical
outcome.

Materials and Methods
Patients with advanced-stage ovarian/primary peritoneal
cancer (PPC) were enrolled in this study between September
2008 and June 2010.

Ascitic ﬂuid was collected from chemotherapy-na€ve
patients, either those undergoing primary surgery or those
undergoing paracentesis before receiving chemotherapy. Ethical approval and speciﬁc consent were obtained for collection
of clinical material and clinical information. None of the
patients had been screened for BRCA mutations or selected
on the basis of a family history of breast or ovarian cancer.
Determination of HR status and ex vivo cytotoxicity to
PARPi
Details of methods have been described in our previous
publication (7). Primary cultures were developed successfully
from ascitic ﬂuid in more than 90% cases. HR function was
determined by an immunoﬂuorescence-based assay, which
detects nuclear gH2AX foci as a marker of DNA double-strand
breaks (DSB) and RAD51 foci as a marker for repair of DSB
by HR. DNA DSBs were induced by 24-hour exposure to
10 mmol/L hydroxyurea (Sigma) or 10 mmol/L potent PARPi
rucaparib (Clovis Oncology Boulder—formerly known as AG014699, PF-01367338; Pﬁzer Oncology). On the basis of previous
work, a 2-fold increase in nuclear RAD51 foci formation over
untreated controls was taken as a cutoff to differentiate
between HR-competent and HRD cultures (7). Ex vivo cytotoxicity following 24-hour exposure to rucaparib was determined by sulforhodamine B (SRB assay in response to 0.0, 0.3,
1.0, 10, 30, or 100 mmol/L of rucaparib) or clonogenic cell
survival assay (in response to 0, 1, 10, or 50 mmol/L rucaparib).
On the basis of our cell line work, cytotoxicity at 10 mmol/L,
rucaparib distinguished between HR-competent and -deﬁcient
cell lines (14). Therefore, we used this cutoff to correlate
cytotoxicity with the HR status determined by RAD51 foci in
primary cultures. For categorical data, cell survival more than
70% compared with the untreated controls was taken as a
cutoff to deﬁne ex vivo chemoresponse.
Clinical data collection
Patient data including age, family history, past history of
cancer, pretreatment tumor markers, operative details and
histologic subtype, stage, and grade were recorded from the
clinical database. Histologic diagnosis of primary ovarian/PPC
was conﬁrmed by independent gynecologic-speciﬁc pathologists (15). Surgical stage, histologic grade, and cell type were
classiﬁed according to the World Health Organization (WHO)
and Federation Internationale des Gynaecologistes et Obstetristes (FIGO) standards.
BRCA1 immunostaining was conducted at Queen University
(Belfast, N. Ireland, UK) on a tumor microarray created from
formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples
that had been characterized for HR status by the RAD51 assay.
The scoring was done by 2 independent pathologists who
were blinded to the HR status of the tumors. The original
scoring estimated the percentage of cells stained, using a 6point scale, (none, <10%, 10%–25%, 25%–50%, 50%–75%, and
>75%), and also the intensity of staining (weak, moderate,
strong). A modiﬁed H-score was generated by multiplying the
area score with the intensity score giving a range of score from
1 to 18. A score of 4 was considered to be the cutoff point for a
negative BRCA1 immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. This

5676

score was chosen as it correlates with the 10% cutoff used in
previous work (16).
Patients underwent maximal effort primary cytoreductive
surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval
debulking surgery. All surgeries were carried out by accredited
Gynaecologic Oncologists. The following deﬁnitions were used
for cytoreduction; complete, no visible residual disease; optimal, <1 cm residual disease maximum diameter; and suboptimal, >1 cm residual disease.
All patients received platinum-based chemotherapy with
or without paclitaxel as ﬁrst-line treatment. Analysis of patient
survival and tumor response was limited to patients who
completed at least 6-month follow-up since the last cycle of
platinum-based chemotherapy. Response to chemotherapy
was determined by serial clinical examinations, CA125 levels,
and computed tomographic (CT) scans at predeﬁned intervals
and at completion of chemotherapy unless new onset symptoms warranted urgent evaluation. Comparison was made
with pretreatment (chemotherapy) imaging and tumor markers. Tumor response was deﬁned as radiologic evidence of
complete/partial response or a CA125 response deﬁned as
more than 50% decline sustained for at least 4 weeks (17, 18).
Tumor progression/recurrence was deﬁned as the presence of
progressive disease on CT scan, increasing CA125 levels, or
clinical evidence. Chemosensitivity to platinum was deﬁned as
1, platinum sensitive—no tumor progression within 6 months
of completion of chemotherapy as 2, platinum-resistant—
tumor progression within 6 months of completion of chemotherapy but after posttreatment evaluation as 3, platinumrefractory—tumor progression while on chemotherapy up to
the date of their posttreatment evaluation (19).
Deﬁnitions used for survival data
Survival data were calculated using the date of diagnosis,
deﬁned as the date of histologic or cytologic conﬁrmation of
EOCs. For overall survival (OS), patients who died at follow-up
(any cause) were considered uncensored, whereas patients
alive at follow-up were censored (20).
Statistical analyses
Statistical Package for Social Sciences Software (SPSS version 15.0; SPSS Inc.) was used for analyses. The association
between HR status and various clinicopathologic factors was
assessed by the c2 and the Fisher exact tests. The Spearman
test was applied for analyses of correlations. Univariate analyses for OS and PFS were generated by Kaplan–Meier survival
curves and log-rank (Mantel–Cox) tests for statistical significance. Multivariate analyses to adjust for known prognostic
factors were conducted by using a Cox proportional hazards
regression model. For all statistical analyses, signiﬁcant differences were set as P < 0.05 at the 2-sided test (SPSS version 15.0).

Results
Between September 2008 and June 2010, 75 primary cultures
were generated from ascitic ﬂuid with more than 90% success
rate. HR status was determined in 62 patients. Histologic
reports conﬁrmed non-ovarian/peritoneal origin in 8 cultures
including colon, endometrial, and metastatic breast cancers.

These patients were not followed up for clinicopathologic
correlation but were assessed for HR status and had ex vivo
cytotoxicity tests to correlate with sensitivity to PARPi. Of the
remaining 54 ascitic ﬂuid samples assessed for HR status and
with conﬁrmed EOCs, 50 had ex vivo cytotoxicity tests to
correlate with sensitivity to PARPi. A ﬂow diagram showing
patients included in this study and the correlation of HR status
and cytotoxicity to PARPi is presented in Supplementary Fig.
S1. The data for RAD51 foci and cytotoxicity to 10 mmol/L
rucaparib are presented in Supplementary Fig. S2.
Demographic characters
Demographic data were available for all patients. Fifty
patients with EOC/PPC (HR-competent, n ¼ 24; HR-deﬁcient,
n ¼ 26), who completed follow-up for at least 6 months after
completion of chemotherapy (till April 2011) were included in
the present study for analysis of clinicopathologic variables

(Table 1), platinum sensitivity (Table 2), and survival data
(Table 3).
Histology
Twelve of 50 patients had PPC with a slightly higher proportion of PPCs seen in the HRD group (26.9% vs. 20.8%). The
majority of patients had high-grade (n ¼ 44 of 50), advancedstage III/IV disease (n ¼ 47 of 50), and serous (n ¼ 39 of 50)
carcinomas. The HRD group was predominantly serous compared with the HR-competent patients (92.3% vs. 62.5%, P ¼
0.035). Both the non-serous tumors seen in the HRD group
were of high-grade endometrioid type. In keeping with the
higher prevalence of serous tumors and PPCs, the median
CA125 at presentation was also signiﬁcantly higher in the HRD
group (2,079 vs. 427 U/mL, P ¼ 0.007). BRCA1 IHC was negative
(H-score  4) in 8 of 23 (34.8%) of HRD tumors and negative in 5
of 22 (22.7%) of HR-competent tumors (P ¼ 0.37; Table 1).

NOTE: Platinum sensitivity was deﬁned as no disease recurrence within 6 months of completion of platinum-based chemotherapy.

Treatment modality
The majority of patients (n ¼ 31 of 50) had primary surgery
followed by chemotherapy, whereas the rest (n ¼ 18 of 50) were
treated with 3 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by
interval debulking surgery and further 3 cycles of chemotherapy. One patient in the HRD group opted not to have any
surgery and had 6 cycles of chemotherapy only. One patient in
the HR-competent group died 2 months after primary surgery
and therefore did not have any chemotherapy.
The median duration of follow up was 14 months in both
groups. The majority of women received both platinum
(carboplatin) and paclitaxel combination as ﬁrst-line for
the whole duration of chemotherapy (n ¼ 40 of 50). Eight

of 50 women developed toxicity/allergy to paclitaxel during
therapy and therefore went on to receive platinum only and
2 patients with stage 1c disease received 6 cycles of carboplatin as single-agent therapy. Forty-ﬁve of 50 women completed 6 cycles (4 women died while on chemotherapy and 1
after primary surgery). At the time of ﬁnal follow-up, 46%
women had gone on to receive second-line chemotherapy
and 25% of them further progressed to receive third-line
chemotherapy.
Chemoresponse and sensitivity to platinum
Overall 39 of 50 (78%) women showed evidence of response
to ﬁrst-line chemotherapy as deﬁned above. Women in the

Clinical Features of HR–Deﬁcient Ovarian Cancers

Correlation between in vivo platinum sensitivity and
ex vivo sensitivity to PARPi
Sensitivity to 10 mmol/L rucaparib was seen in 24 of 26
(92.8%) HRD cultures compared with none of the 24 HRcompetent cultures (P < 0.001; Table 2). There was a correlation
between ex vivo sensitivity to PARP inhibition and in vivo
platinum sensitivity (Spearman's r, P ¼ 0.05). Of 23 patients
with ex vivo response to PARPi, 52% were platinum-sensitive.
Conversely, of 23 patients showing no response to ex vivo PARP
inhibition, 78.3% had platinum-resistant/refractory disease.

Discussion
In line with our previous ﬁndings (7), approximately 50% of
EOCs are HR-deﬁcient and show ex vivo cytotoxicity to a PARPi
in more than 90% cases. These ﬁndings are consistent with
other published data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
project, which used molecular pathway analysis of genetic
aberrations to conclude that approximately 50% of high-grade
serous cancers will have defective HRs (21).

Survival
At 12 months, tumor progression was seen in 32 of 50 (64%)
patients (Table 3). However, at 6 months, 7.7% women in the
HRD group relapsed or progressed compared with 33.3% in the
HR-competent group (P ¼ 0.024). Median PFS was longer in
women with HRD tumors (11 vs. 8 months) and was statistically signiﬁcant (Fig. 1A, log-rank ¼ 0.024).
Median OS was longer in HRD women (20 vs.14 months, Fig.
1B, log-rank P ¼ 0.08). Minimum follow-up duration for all
patients was 14 months (maximum 28 months); therefore, we
looked into PFS (Fig. 2A) and OS (Fig. 2B) at 12 months. At 12
months since diagnosis, 13 of 50 (26%) patients died; 11.5% died
in the HRD group compared with 41.7% in the HR-competent
group [P ¼ 0.015; univariate HR for death 0.23; 95% conﬁdence
interval (CI), 0.64–0.84; Fig. 2B]. The poor survival trend in the
HR-competent group was evident even when stratiﬁed for
treatment type and better prognostic factors including serous
subtype, stage of disease (stage 3 or less), and optimal cytoreduction (Table 3). In univariate analysis of the clinical
and pathologic factors studied, only stage of disease (stage 4
vs. lesser stage) was signiﬁcantly associated (HR, 4.90; CI,
1.62–14.73; P ¼ 0.005) with OS at 12 months and therefore
was entered into Cox regression hazards model along with HR
status (Table 4). HRD conferred a 70% reduction in relative risk
of death at 12 months compared with HR-competent patients
after adjusting for stage of disease, although this was not
statistically signiﬁcant. Although not reaching statistical signiﬁcance, patients who had suboptimal cytoreduction had
increased mortality at 12 months compared with optimal or
complete cytoreduction (42.9% vs. 19.4%; P ¼ 0.090) as did
women with a nonserous histology compared with serous
tumors (45.5% vs. 20.5%; P ¼ 0.096).

Figure 1. Kaplan–Meier survival curves for PFS and OS in HR-competent
versus HR-deﬁcient EOCs. A, median PFS was higher in HRD group (11
vs. 8 months, log-rank, P ¼ 0.024). B, median OS was 19 months in HRD
group compared with 14 months in HR-competent group (log-rank,
P ¼ 0.08).

These data further support the clinical use of PARPi in this
group of patients, supporting data from the recently
reported study of maintenance PARPi treatment with olaparib in this group (22). Conversely, we would predict that
cancers that do not have HRD are unlikely to respond to
this class of agents.
We also conclude that HRD EOC as a group has a distinct
clinicopathologic phenotype compared with HR-competent
EOCs; they are predominantly serous, show increased sensitivity
to platinum, and tend to be associated with improved survival.
The results from our study are consistent with the prediction
of the proportion of BRCAness phenotype expected in sporadic cancers as described by Turner and colleagues (6) and
speciﬁc mechanisms have been identiﬁed in several studies
(23–29). A limited number of studies have explored the

the oral PARPi olaparib seems to correlate with platinum-free
interval, platinum-sensitive cancers showing a greater clinical
beneﬁt rate (30). In cell lines, reversion of open reading frames
in the BRCA gene confers platinum resistance as well as
resistance to PARPi (35, 36). Our study also shows a correlation
between HRD status, ex vivo PARPi sensitivity, and clinical
platinum sensitivity. An interesting group to study would
appear to be women whose ascitic ﬂuid cultures suggest that
they would be sensitive to a PARPi but were shown to be
platinum-resistant/refractory (14 of 32 women in our study).
Whether in recurrent EOCs, administration of PARPi helps to
regain chemosensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy is
currently being studied (37).
The strength of our study in terms of clinicopathologic
and survival data is that it was a prospective study. Although
not randomized, clinicians involved in managing the
patients as regard to surgery or chemotherapy were not
aware of the HR status. Also, blinding was maintained at
time of clinical data collection and analysis. The HRD group
was predominantly serous, associated with a higher proportion of PPCs and higher CA125 at presentation, which ﬁts
with our prediction that HRD phenotype is similar to BRCAdeﬁcient tumors. Although patients were not screened for
genetic testing, nor presented with known mutations except
one woman in the HRD group who was subsequently found
to have a germ line BRCA2 mutation, a higher proportion of
women in the HRD group had a family history of breast/
ovarian cancers in ﬁrst-degree relatives (33%) as well as a
past history of breast cancer. It is possible to postulate
with these data that HR competence confers a biologically

relationship between HR and response to platinum or PARPi
(26, 30–33). Our study is unique in that HR status was evaluated
in clinical material from chemo-na€ve patients with predominantly sporadic EOCs. Irrespective of the speciﬁc genetic
aberration, our functional assay was able to predict accurately
the group of women who could potentially beneﬁt from PARPi
(7). One interesting observation from our study was that even
in non-EOCs or cancers from other sites, HR status was
predictive of response to PARPi (Supplementary Fig. S1). This
suggests a potential wider application of a functional HR assay
and use of PARPi in other cancer types (34).
The other question that emerges from this study is whether
these assays can be used as a surrogate response biomarker
for other agents such as platinum. There is a correlation
between chemosensitivity to platinum and PARPi, and
BRCA-deﬁcient EOCs have been shown to have increased
platinum sensitivity (26, 31). In clinical studies, response to

Clinical Features of HR–Deﬁcient Ovarian Cancers

aggressive phenotype that leads to tumors presenting at
higher stage, poor histologic subtypes, poor surgical resectability, and chemoresistance. There was a very poor correlation with the BRCA1 status on IHC and the HR status. Only
35% of HRD tumors were negative for BRCA1 immunostaining implying other defects in the HR pathway such as a
BRCA2 defect and further validates the need for development of a functional assay for HRs.
Retrospective studies with long-term patient follow-up
have indicated a signiﬁcant OS beneﬁt of 72 versus 41
months in patients with a BRCA-like proﬁle on gene expression analysis (8). Our study will need long-term follow-up
with the ongoing increase in patients' numbers to show a
statistically relevant difference. However, in advanced EOCs,
even short-term endpoints such as tumor progression at 6
months or OS at 12 months are clinically relevant especially
taking into account that the majority of women (75%) are
likely to develop disease progression and die from the
disease (38). At these intervals, our data suggest a trend
toward a survival beneﬁt in the HRD group. A higher
proportion of women in the HRD group received secondand third-line chemotherapy as they survived longer despite
disease progression.
To conclude, HR deﬁciency may identify a distinct group
with favorable biologic features not only in the context of EOCs
but also in other cancer types. There is a need to develop a
functional assay to identify this group of tumors that is
feasible and applicable in clinical settings. Clinical and translational data from ongoing clinical trials studying the role of

PARPi in sporadic ovarian cancers might provide further
insight into this group of cancers (39).
