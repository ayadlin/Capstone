Abstract

Author Manuscript

Aggressive cancers and embryonic stem (ES) cells share a common gene expression signature.
Identifying the key factors/pathway(s) within this ES signature responsible for the aggressiveness
of cancers can lead to a potential cure. In this study, we find that SALL4, a gene involved in the
maintenance of ES cell self-renewal, is aberrantly expressed in 47.7% of primary human
endometrial cancer samples. It is not expressed in normal or hyperplastic endometrial. More
importantly, SALL4 expression is positively correlated with worse patient survival and aggressive
features such as metastasis in endometrial carcinoma. Further functional studies have shown that
loss of SALL4 inhibits endometrial cancer cell growth in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo, as a
result of inhibition of cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. In addition, down-regulation of
SALL4 significantly impedes the migration and invasion properties of endometrial cancer cells in
vitro and their metastatic potential in vivo. Furthermore, manipulation of SALL4 expression can
affect drug sensitivity of endometrial cancer cells to carboplatin. Moreover, we show that SALL4
specifically binds to the c-Myc promoter region in endometrial cancer cells. While downregulation of SALL4 leads to a decreased expression of c-Myc at both protein and mRNA levels,
ectopic SALL4 overexpression causes increased c-Myc protein and mRNA expression, indicating

that c-Myc is one of the SALL4 downstream targets in endometrial tumorigenesis. In summary,
we are the first to demonstrate that SALL4 plays functional role(s) in metastasis and drug
resistance in aggressive endometrial cancer. As a consequence of its functional roles in cancer cell
and absence in normal tissue, SALL4 is a potential novel therapeutic target for the high risk
endometrial cancer patient population.

Introduction
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Endometrial carcinoma is the most common gynecologic malignancy in the world.
According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), there are 8,010 deaths from endometrial
cancer in the United States in 2012. While most patients (80%) can be surgically cured with
a hysterectomy, the remaining 20% patients who are diagnosed with advanced or recurrent
disease have far worse survival rates and limited adjuvant treatment options 1, 2. Discovery
of novel target(s)/pathway(s) is needed for better understanding of the pathogenesis and
treatment development for this disease. Recent studies have shown that aggressive tumor
cells share a common gene expression signature with embryonic stem (ES) cells 3, 4. In these
studies, SALL4 has been identified as one of the top-ranked genes enriched in high-grade
cancers. As a transcription factor, SALL4 is known for its essential role in early embryonic
development, and Sall4 null mice die shortly after implantation 5, 6. Similar to OCT4, SOX2
and NANOG, SALL4 is essential to maintain ES cells in a self-renewal and undifferentiated
state. By using a transgenic murine model, we previously reported that SALL4 can function
as an oncogene in leukemogenesis 7. Thereafter, its aberrant expression in germ cell tumors
and other solid tumors has been reported by various groups 8–10. However, in-depth studies
on the functional role(s) of SALL4 in tumorigenesis of uterine tumors are still lacking.

Author Manuscript

In this study, by screening SALL4 expression in a cohort of endometrial cancer samples, we
find that SALL4 is aberrantly expressed in endometrial cancer patient samples when
compared to normal controls. More importantly, high SALL4 expression is significantly
correlated with worse patient survival and metastasis capacity. Using human endometrial
cancer cell lines, we have further conducted extensive investigations on the biological role
of SALL4 in endometrial carcinogenesis. Both our in vitro and in vivo data strongly suggest
that SALL4 expression is essential in endometrial cancer survival and progression, which is
achieved by promoting tumor metastasis and chemoresistance. This mechanism of SALL4
in endometrial cancer is mediated at least in part through activation of c-Myc. Taken
together our studies hold potential promise on targeting SALL4 as a novel therapeutic option
for endometrial cancer patients, especially those with advanced or recurrent disease.

Results
SALL4 is aberrantly expressed in endometrial carcinoma, and significantly correlated with
poor survival

Author Manuscript

To examine SALL4 expression in endometrial cancer, we constructed and screened a panel
of tissue microarrays consisting of 113 endometrial cancer samples. Twenty one normal
endometria and five hyperplastic samples were used as controls. Among the 113 endometrial
cancer cases, 47.7% were positive for SALL4 expression, albeit at variable expression
levels. In contrast, SALL4 expression was not detected in hyperplasic and normal
endometrial tissues. The data are summarized in Table 1 and Table S1, and representative
images are shown in Figure 1a and S1. In addition, we also evaluated SALL4 mRNA
expression in endometrial cancers. Using snap-frozen patient samples, SALL4 mRNA
expression was validated in endometrial carcinoma samples using quantitative reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Since we have previously identified
that human SALL4 has two isoforms (SALL4A and SALL4B) 7, isoform-specific primers
and Taqman probes were used for qRT-PCR. By qRT-PCR, we established that both
isoforms were elevated in a subgroup of primary endometrial cancers compared to normal
(Figure S1).
To examine if the upregulation of SALL4 has any clinical significance in endometrial
carcinoma, we carried out clinicopathological analysis to see if SALL4 expression predicts
poor prognosis. We retrieved clinicopathological and demographic data of 113 endometrial
carcinoma cases (Table 1 and S2). We found that SALL4 expression was significantly
correlated with poor survival of EC patients (P = 0.05) (Figure 1b).

We next chose to compare our observation with existing published expression database on
endometrial cancer. Levan et al. have reported a gene signature that can predict poor
prognosis in endometrial carcinoma 11. We extracted the gene expression profiles and reanalyzed the data in order to examine if SALL4 was differentially expressed between
survivor and non-survivor groups. We found that SALL4 expression was significantly
higher in the non-survivor compared to the survivor group (Figure 1c). Furthermore, we
carried out Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to investigate if gene sets that have
prognostic values are enriched in SALL4-expressing endometrial carcinomas from the same
database. Indeed, in SALL4-expressing endometrial carcinoma, we observed enrichment of
gene sets upregulated in cancers with poor survival (P < 0.001), metastasis (P < 0.001),
advanced tumor stage (P < 0.001), and proliferation (P < 0.001). On the other hand, gene
sets that are enriched in cancers with good survival (P < 0.001) and downregulated in
cancers of advanced stage (P < 0.001), proliferation (P = 0.006) and metastasis (P = 0.047)
are enriched in SALL4-negative endometrial carcinomas (Figure 1d and Figure S2).
In summary, these results support that SALL4 expression is significantly correlated with
poor survival of endometrial cancer patients.

Silencing of SALL4 inhibits cell growth in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo as a result of
decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis

Author Manuscript

To assess the biological functional role of SALL4 in endometrial cancer, we first evaluated
SALL4 expression in a panel of six endometrial cancer cell lines using qRT-PCR to select
for appropriate models for our functional studies (Figure S3). Three cell lines, AN3CA,
HEC-1A and Ishikawa were selected for subsequent studies based on their endogenous
SALL4 expression of high, moderate, or undetectable levels, which best represented the
differential SALL4 expression levels encountered in primary human endometrial cancer
tissues. To suppress SALL4 expression in endometrial cancer cells, two short hairpin RNAs
(shRNAs) specifically targeting both SALL4A and SALL4B isoforms, designated as
SALL4-sh1 and SALL4-sh2, were chosen and optimized from 5 constructs. AN3CA and
HEC-1A cells were infected with lentivirus expressing shRNAs. On day 4 after infection,
loss of SALL4 induced substantial cell death in both AN3CA and HEC-1A cells. The
changes in cell morphology and apoptotic phenotypes were visible by light microscopy
(Figure 2a). Knockdown efficiency of the two shRNAs was verified by Western blot and
qRT-PCR (Figure 2b and c). Both shRNAs could down-regulate SALL4A and SALL4B
efficiently in AN3CA and HEC-1A cells.

Author Manuscript

To elucidate the role of SALL4 in endometrial cancer cell survival, the viability of
lentiviral-infected AN3CA and HEC1-A cells was first examined by MTS assay over a
period of time. The growth rate of SALL4-knockdown cells was significantly decreased
compared to those of scrambled shRNA-treated control cells (Figure 2d). In contrast, no
significant effect was observed upon SALL4 knockdown in Ishikawa cells, which had
undetectable SALL4 expression endogenously (Figure S4). To further verify that the effects
of shRNAs are specific, we prepared SALL4A and SALL4B overexpression constructs that
carried triple-point mutation within the 21-bp sequence targeted by SALL4-sh1. These
mutations did not lead to an amino acid sequence change of SALL4 protein but rendered the
overexpression constructs insensitive to inhibition by SALL4-sh1, and therefore could be
used as rescue mutants to test the specificity of the shRNA. After co-infection of AN3CA
cells with SALL4-sh1 and rescue mutant SALL4A or SALL4B lentivirus, we observed that
mutant SALL4A alone or SALL4B alone was able to partially rescue SALL4 shRNA
induced phenotype (Figure S5).

Author Manuscript

The decrease in cell growth could be due to impaired proliferation and/or increased cell
death. To determine the effect of SALL4 knockdown on cell proliferation, we measured
BrdU incorporation in vitro by flow cytometry. SALL4 knockdown significantly decreased
the proportions of BrdU-positive proliferating endometrial cancer cells (Figure 2e). We next
assessed the effect of SALL4 depletion on the apoptotic activity of the endometrial cancer
cells using AnnexinV staining. The percentages of Annexin V-positive cells were much
higher in SALL4 knockdown groups than the scrambled control groups (Figure 2f).
Collectively, these data suggest that loss of SALL4 inhibits cell proliferation and triggers
cell apoptosis in vitro.
The oncogenic role of SALL4 in endometrial cancer was further confirmed by using
xenograft mouse models. First, a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model was developed to

assess the tumor growth rate in vivo. Two million AN3CA cells treated with either
scrambled control or SALL4 shRNA-expressing lentiviruses were injected subcutaneously
into the right flank region of NOD/SCID mice and monitored for tumor development. As
shown in Figure 3a and b, tumor growth induced by the SALL4 knockdown group was
dramatically slower than that induced by scrambled shRNA-treated cells. The excised
tumors were then subjected to routine histology processing and immunostaining analysis.
Cellular proliferation in tumor tissues was assessed by immunostaining with anti-Ki-67
antibody (Figure 3c, right panel). Decreased Ki-67 staining was observed in the small
tumors induced by SALL4 knockdown cells compared to the controls, suggesting that loss
of SALL4 could significantly inhibit cell proliferation. On the contrary, subcutaneous
tumors induced by SALL4 knockdown cells showed a marked increase in the number of
apoptotic cells as detected by TUNEL analysis (Figure 3c, left panel).

Author Manuscript

Despite the fact that the subcutaneous xenograft murine model is suitable for monitoring
tumor growth locally, this model has limitations in mimicking human endometrial cancer
disease progression. Therefore, we also attempted an intra-peritoneal xenograft model to
assay for the effect of SALL4 down-regulation on the tumorigenicity of AN3CA cells. Ten
million AN3CA cells treated with either scrambled control or SALL4 shRNA-expressing
lentiviruses were injected into the peritoneal cavity of NOD/SCID mice and the recipients
mice were monitored for tumor development and overall health status. While the scrambled
control-treated NOD/SCID recipient mice died of disseminated tumor within 2 months of
tumor cell injection, the SALL4 shRNA-treated NOD/SCID recipient mice were still alive at
the end of study. A statistically significant difference in survival was observed between the
two groups of mice (Figure S6).

Author Manuscript

Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that silencing SALL4 inhibits endometrial
cancer cell growth in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo by inhibiting proliferation and
triggering apoptosis.
Down-regulation of SALL4 decreases the invasiveness of endometrial cancer in vitro and
blocks its metastatic potential in vivo

Author Manuscript

Metastasis is a central problem in cancer therapeutics. Since our analysis showed a positive
correlation between SALL4 expression and endometrial cancer metastasis, we next aimed to
assess whether loss of SALL4 could affect tumor invasiveness. In a wound-healing assay, a
much slower wound closure rate was observed in the SALL4 knockdown AN3CA and
HEC-1A cells as compared to the scrambled shRNA-treated cells (Figure 4a). In transwell
migration and invasion assays, significantly reduced migration and invasion were also
observed in AN3CA and HEC-1A cells upon SALL4 knockdown (Figure 4b). We then
asked whether loss of SALL4 could influence cell migration and metastasis formation in
vivo. We compared the invasive potential of AN3CA, HEC-1A and Ishikawa cell lines in
vitro and detected a strong association between SALL4 expression and invasive capacity,
with Ishikawa showed the least migration/invasion ability.
We next explored the role of SALL4 in endometrial cancer metastasis by using another
xenotransplant model. The most invasive cell line with high endogenous SALL4 expression,
AN3CA, was chosen for the in vivo metastasis assay. SALL4-knockdown or scrambled

shRNA-treated AN3CA cells were injected into NOD/SCID mice through the retro-orbital
route, representing an intra-venous (i.v.) xenotransplant model. Metastasis of the tumor in
all organs was evaluated 6 weeks later when scrambled shRNA-treated recipient mice
became morbid. Five out of six scrambled shRNA-treated AN3CA recipients had markedly
enlarged tumor-bearing livers (Figure 4c, left upper panel), with tumor morphology
recapitulating that of the tumors found in patients with poorly differentiated invasive
endometrial carcinoma (Figure 4c, left lower panel and Figure S7). In contrast, all the
SALL4 shRNA-treated AN3CA recipients (n=9) had no detectable tumors macroscopically
or microscopically by routine H&E examination in any of the organs we evaluated,
including liver, kidney (Figure S7), lung and spleen. Only by staining for GFP, which was
used to mark the shRNA infected tumor cells, we were able to identify a few microscopic
clusters of GFP positive cells in the tissues of SALL4-shRNA treated recipient mice (Figure
S8). This is in contrast to large GFP positive tumor nodules in tissue organs observed in
scrambled shRNA-treated recipient mice (Figure S8). These data suggest that SALL4 is
essential to maintain the invasive state of endometrial cancer cells.
Manipulation of SALL4 expression affects the sensitivity of endometrial cancer cells to
carboplatin treatment

Author Manuscript

Drug resistance is another important problem in endometrial cancer patients with advanced
stages. We next asked whether SALL4 expression could affect the sensitivity of endometrial
cancer cells to carboplatin treatment. Clonogenic assay and MTS assay revealed that
overexpression of SALL4 in carboplatin-sensitive Ishikawa cells could promote carboplatinresistance in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5a, b, c and figure S9). Furthermore, we
observed that both SALL4A and SALL4B transfected Ishikawa showed increased
proliferation after carboplatin treatment compared to empty vector control as demonstrated
by Ki-67 staining (Figure 5d). In addition, SALL4 overexpression could significantly protect
cells from apoptosis induced by carboplatin treatment, assayed by TUNEL staining (Figure
5d). On the contrary, in carboplatin resistant HEC-1A cells, knocking-down SALL4
significantly restored the sensitivity of these cells to carboplatin treatment (Figure 5e and f).
In summary, our data suggest that in endometrial cancer, upregulation of SALL4 expression
can contribute to chemotherapy resistance.
SALL4 directly regulates c-Myc transcriptional activity in endometrial cancer cells

Author Manuscript

To explore the mechanism of SALL4 in endometrial cancer, we focused on its potential
downstream target gene(s) known to be involved in cancer metastasis and drug resistance.
We have previously performed a genome-wide analysis of SALL4 target genes in myeloid
leukemic NB4 cells as well as murine ES cells using chromatin immunoprecipitation
followed by microarray on the promoter regions (ChIP-chip) approach 12, 13. Re-analyzing
these ChIP-chip data sets, we found that SALL4 could bind to the c-Myc promoter region in
these cells (Figure 6a). It is possible that SALL4 regulates c-Myc in endometrial cancer as
well. To test this hypothesis, we verified the ChIP-chip result quantitatively using a regular
ChIP coupled with qPCR approach. We demonstrated that SALL4 indeed could bind to the
promoter region of c-Myc in AN3CA cells (Figure 6b). To examine the regulatory effect of
SALL4 on c-Myc expression, we performed western blot and qRT-PCR analysis after

SALL4 knockdown in AN3CA and HEC-1A cells. SALL4 silencing in these two cell lines
significantly decreased the protein and mRNA expression of c-Myc compared to scrambled
control (Figure 6c and d). A parallel ectopic SALL4 overexpression experiment was carried
out in Ishikawa cells, which have negligible endogenous SALL4 expression. As shown in
Figure 6c and e, both SALL4A and SALL4B overexpression could significantly increase cMyc protein and mRNA expression. These data suggest that SALL4 can directly regulate cMyc in endometrial cancer.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

It has been proposed that human pre-implantation embryonic cells share similar phenotypes
with cancer cells. Both types of cells are at a proliferative stem/undifferentiated cell state
and are potentially immortal. Furthermore, cancer with an ES cell gene expression signature
has poor prognosis 3. We and others have shown that Sall4 is a key factor of the
transcriptional core network essential for the maintenance of the stemness of ES cells 14, 15.
SALL4 is also abnormally expressed in germ cell tumors and has been proposed as a
diagnostic marker for these tumors 8. However, more comprehensive and systematic studies
on the functional role(s) of SALL4 in human solid tumors such as endometrial cancer are
still lacking.

Author Manuscript

In this study, we set out to test our hypothesis that SALL4 is re-expressed in solid cancer
cells and contributes to cancer cell tumorigenic properties, focusing on the endometrial
cancer model. Our study suggests that SALL4 is re-expressed in almost half of the
endometrial cancers at both the mRNA and protein levels, but not in the pre-neoplastic
endometrial hyperplasia or normal endometrial tissues. More importantly, our clinical data
combined with GESA analysis also support that aberrant SALL4 expression is positively
correlated with aggressive tumor features including worse survival, increased metastasis and
advanced tumor stages. Using gain- and loss-of-functional studies, we further confirmed the
essential role of SALL4 in cancer cell survival, metastasis, and drug resistance of
endometrial cancer. Indeed, from our immunohistochemistry study, we observed elevated
SALL4 expression in 47.7% of endometrial carcinoma (n=113) were positive for SALL4
expression (Table S1).

Author Manuscript

The ability of tumor cells to acquire metastatic potential and spread in their host organism is
one of the main issues in cancer treatment, as metastasis accounts for more than 90% of
human cancer-related deaths 16. Our correlation study on SALL4 expression and other
clinicopathological characteristics of the endometrial cancer patients reveals a positive
correlation between high SALL4 expression and poor patient survival, and our GSEA data
have suggested that SALL4 is positively correlated with tumor metastatic capacity in
addition to poor patient survival. Furthermore, both our in vitro cell culture and in vivo
murine data have confirmed that SALL4 expression is critical for tumor invasive capacity,
metastatic ability, and survival of the xenotransplant recipient mice. This suggests that
SALL4 can be a potential therapeutic target and blocking the oncogenic role of SALL4
could potentially benefit patients with more advanced endometrial cancer, whose prognosis
are very poor in general with a median survival of less than 1 year 17. Future studies are
needed to test this potential.

Another challenging hurdle in cancer therapy is chemoresistance. C-Myc is frequently
overexpressed in a wide range of human cancers, including endometrial carcinoma 18–20. In
addition, the role of c-Myc in tumor metastasis and drug resistance has been extensively
studied 21–24. In this report, we have demonstrated that c-Myc is one of SALL4 target genes
by ChIP-qPCR assay. Furthermore, our loss- and gain-of-function studies have shown that
c-Myc expression level is regulated directly by SALL4, and manipulation of SALL4
expression can affect drug sensitivity of endometrial cancer cells. Therefore, we propose
that c-Myc is one of the key target genes of SALL4 in endometrial cancer, which could
contribute, at least in part, to SALL4-mediated metastasis and drug resistance. Since SALL4
is also involved in leukemia and other solid tumors, it is will be interesting to test whether
the SALL4/c-Myc pathway could be a general property of SALL4-mediated tumorigenisis.

Author Manuscript

In summary, our study has revealed the following novel and important findings: (I) SALL4
is not expressed in normal or hyperplastic endometrial, but is aberrantly expressed in 47.7%
of endometrial carcinoma, and its expression was positively correlated with aggressive
tumor features; (II) SALL4 is critical for endometrial cancer cell survival, drug resistance
and tumor progression. As a consequence of being an oncofetal protein with functional roles
in cancer cell and absence in normal tissue, SALL4 represents an attractive novel drug target
for the high risk endometrial cancer patient population, similar to what we have reported for
aggressive hepatocellular carcinomas 25. Overall, our finding provides novel insight to the
mechanism and potential therapeutic target for endometrial cancer patients.

Materials and Methods
Patient samples

Review Board (NUS IRB 09-261).
SALL4 immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis

Author Manuscript

Immunohistochemical staining was performed according to standard techniques. Briefly,
paraffin tissue sections of 4μm were deparaffinized with Histoclear and hydrated in graded
ethanols. Antigen retrieval was performed by boiling at 120°C in high pH target retrieval
solution for 10 minutes in a pressure cooker. Primary antibodies were incubated at room
temperature for 1 hour in a humidified chamber, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary
antibody incubation for 30 minutes at room temperature. Antibody binding was revealed by
DAB and reaction was stopped by immersion of tissue sections in distilled water once
brown color appeared. Tissue sections were counterstained by hematoxylin, dehydrated in
graded ethanol and mounted. Monoclonal anti-SALL4 antibody (Santa Cruz, CA, USA
#sc-101147) was used. All reagents for immunohistochemistry were from Dako (Dako,
Denmark A/S). Appropriate positive and negative controls were included for each run of
IHC. For IHC on TMAs, SALL4 expression was scored according to the percentage of

Human SALL4A or SALL4B fragments were subcloned into a modified lentiviral vector
(FUW-Luc-mCh-puro) with mCherry and puromycin selection markers (Figure S5a).
SALL4A or SALL4B mutant preserving the same amino acid sequence, but containing
triple-point mutations within the SALL4shRNA1 target nucleotide sequence which renders
the transgenes resistant to SALL4 shRNA targeting, were generated using QuikChange sitedirected mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. Short hairpin RNAs set
for human SALL4 in pLKO.1-puro vector were purchased from Open Biosystems

Wound-healing, Migration and Invasion assays

Author Manuscript

An artificial “wound” was created on a confluent cell monolayer and photographs were
taken at the indicated time. A permeable filter of transwell system (8-μm pores size,
Transwell Permeable supports, Cat. No.3422, Corning Incoporated, MA) was used for
migration assays and 24-well plates with Matrigel-coated inserts (8-μm pores; BD
Biosciences) were used for matrigel invasion assays. After puromycin selection, shRNAsinfected cells were added to inserts in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells
were incubated for the indicated time periods under standard culture conditions. Tumor cells
remaining on the top-side of the membrane were removed by cotton swab. Cells that
migrated to the underside were fixed and stained with crystal violet solution. After taking
pictures, the stained cells were solubilized with 10% acetic acid and quantitated on a
microplate reader at 600nm.

Xenotransplant murine models

Author Manuscript

All experimental procedures involving animals were conducted in accordance with the
institutional guidelines set forth by the Children’s Hospital Boston (CHB animal protocol
number 11-09-2022). Eight to ten-week-old NOD/SCID mice were housed in a specific
pathogen-free facility. To generate a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model, NOD/SCID
mice were injected subcutaneously with 2×106 cells into right flanks. Cells were
resuspended in 0.1 ml of PBS and then mixed with 0.1ml of matrigel. Tumor sizes were
measured weekly. For development of the i.p. injection xenograft model, ten million cells,
suspended in 500ul of phosphate-buffered saline, were injected with a 25-gauge needle into
the peritoneal cavity of NOD/SCID mice and disease progression was monitored based on
overall health status of the recipient mice. As for the metastatic mouse model, one million
1×106 AN3CA cells were injected via the retro-orbital sinus route as a method of i.v.
xenotransplant model described previously. After 6 weeks, mice were euthanized and organs
were checked for metastasis. Tissues of the liver, lung, spleen, and kidney were collected
and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for further routine histology examination by
hematoxylin and eosin stain (H&E.). Tissue sections were also stained with anti-GFP
antibody (Abcam, Cat. No. ab6556). The antibody was utilized at 1:400 in a Leica Bond-III
autostainer using the Bond Polymer Refine Detection kit according to manufacturer’s
protocol. Cell proliferation in the tumors was determined by staining histological sections
with monoclonal antibody against Ki-67 (BD, Cat. No.556003), and apoptosis was evaluated
by terminal uridine deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay (in
situ cell death detection kit, Promega, Cat. No. G3250) according to manufacturer’s
protocol.

Cell proliferation and apoptosis
Cell proliferation was monitored by the MTS assay as described29, and BrdU incorporation
assay. The BD Pharmingen BrdU flow kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) was used.
BrdU was added up to 1 hour before harvesting of cells, and incorporation to the cells was
assessed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Simultaneous staining of DNA with
7-amino-actinomycin D was used in combination with BrdU, followed by two-color flow

cytometric analysis. Apoptosis was assayed by AnnexinV kit following a protocol from the
supplier (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).
qChIP (Chromatin immunoprecipitation) and qRT-PCR
AN3CA cells were grown and processed for qChIP as described previously 30 using an antiSALL4 antibody. Real-time PCR was performed with two sets of c-Myc primers (Table S3)
to validate pulldown DNA fragment. Normal IgG was used as a negative control. Total
RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) or RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Real-time PCR
for SALL4A and B was performed with the TaqMan PCR core reagent kit (Applied
Biosystems) as described previously 7. C-Myc mRNA expression was measured using
iScript One-step RT-PCR Kit with SYBR Green (Bio-Rad). C-Myc primers are as follows:
Forward 5′TCAAGAGGCGAACACACAAC-3′; Reverse: 5′GGCCTTTTCATTGTTTTCCA-3′.

GSEA analysis
Gene expression data of endometrial carcinoma was extracted from the GEO database
(Accession number: GSE21882). Prior to GSEA, all EC samples were divided into two
groups according to their SALL4 expression: SALL4 high and SALL4 low. GSEA was then
performed based on normalized data using GSEA v2.0 tool (http://www.broad.mit.edu/
gsea/) for identification of enriched gene sets between SALL4 high & SALL4 low groups.
Chemoresistance assay

Author Manuscript

Carboplatin was purchased from Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. No. C2538). Cultured cells
were plated in 6-well plates to allow for colony formation for 2–3 weeks, or cells were
seeded on coverslips overnight. Then, cells were treated with indicated dosages of
carboplatin for 72 hours. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated by MTS assay,
Ki-67 staining or TUNEL assay respectively as described above.
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean ± SD from at least three independent experiments. Statistical
significance between two groups was determined by student t-test or Pearson’s chi-squared
test (χ2) test (GraphPad Prism 5.0 Software). Log-rank test was used for survival analysis.
The value of p<0.05 was considered significant (*).

Figure 1. SALL4 expression is associated with poor survival and metastasis in endometrial
cancer patients

(a) Representative IHC images show positive SALL4 expression in endometrial cancer and
absence of SALL4 in normal endometria and hyperplasia. Scale bars = 500μm (upper
panels) and 50μm (lower panel). (b) Clinicopathological analysis demonstrates SALL4
expression is significantly correlated with worse survival of EC patients (p =0.05). SALL4
low/negative group includes IHC 0 and 1+, and SALL4 high group includes IHC 2+ or
above. (c) Microarray analysis confirms that SALL4 expression was significantly higher in
non-survivor compared to survivor of endometrial cancer. (d) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA) reveals that in high SALL4-expressing endometrial carcinoma, there is an
enrichment of gene sets upregulated in cancers with poor survival (left panel, p<0.001); On
the contrary, gene sets that are enriched in cancers with good survival are enriched in
SALL4-negative endometrial carcinoma (right panel, p<0.001).
