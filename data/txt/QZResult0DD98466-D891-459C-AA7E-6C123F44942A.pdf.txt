Abstract
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) promptly adapt hematopoiesis to stress conditions, such as infection and cancer, replenishing
bone marrow–derived circulating populations, while preserving
the stem cell reservoir. SOCS2, a feedback inhibitor of JAK–STAT
pathways, is expressed in most primitive HSC and is upregulated
in response to STAT5-inducing cytokines. We demonstrate that
Socs2 deﬁciency unleashes HSC proliferation in vitro, sustaining
STAT5 phosphorylation in response to IL3, thrombopoietin, and
GM-CSF. In vivo, SOCS2 deﬁciency leads to unrestricted myelopoietic response to 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU) and, in turn, induces
exhaustion of long-term HSC function along serial bone marrow
transplantations. The emerging role of SOCS2 in HSC under stress
conditions prompted the investigation of malignant hematopoiesis. High levels of SOCS2 characterize unfavorable subsets of
acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemias, such as those with

MLL and BCR/ABL abnormalities, and correlate with the enrichment of genes belonging to hematopoietic and leukemic stemness
signatures. In this setting, SOCS2 and its correlated genes are part
of regulatory networks fronted by IKZF1/Ikaros and MEF2C, two
transcriptional regulators involved in normal and leukemic
hematopoiesis that have never been linked to SOCS2. Accordingly, a comparison of murine wt and Socs2/ HSC gene expression in response to 5-FU revealed a signiﬁcant overlap with the
molecular programs that correlate with SOCS2 expression in
leukemias, particularly with the oncogenic pathways and with
the IKZF1/Ikaros and MEF2C-predicted targets. Lentiviral gene
transduction of murine hematopoietic precursors with Mef2c, but
not with Ikzf1, induces Socs2 upregulation, unveiling a direct
control exerted by Mef2c over Socs2 expression. Cancer Res; 75

Introduction

ﬂow of differentiated hematopoietic cells. Under hematopoietic
stress, such as infections, traumata, myeloablation, and cancer,
HSC on one side proliferate to reconstitute the affected hematopoietic pools or expand speciﬁc hematopoietic populations such
as myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the presence of cancer; on
the other side, even in conditions of emergency hematopoiesis,
they do need to maintain the stem cell reservoir (3, 4).
HSC quiescence, activation, self-renewal, and differentiation
under bone marrow stress are regulated by cytokines (5), including stem cell factor (SCF), IL3, thrombopoietin (TPO), erythropoietin (EPO), Flt3/Flk2 ligand (Flt3L), GM-CSF, G-CSF, and IL6.
Signal transduction of most hematopoietic cytokines passes
through the Janus-activated kinase (JAK) and signal transducer
and activator of transcription (STAT; ref. 5). Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family comprises eight members (SOCS17 and CIS) with similar structures, which are induced upon JAK/
STAT activation and function as negative feedback. SOCS1 and
SOCS3 immunologic roles are widely recognized (6, 7). SOCS2
has been initially described as a regulator of the growth hormone–
insulin-like growth factor 1 axis (8, 9) and only recently has been
recognized as controller of immunologic functions (10–12).
SOCS2 basal expression is higher in HSC (particularly LT-HSC)
than in differentiated populations (13–16), and it is upregulated
following STAT5 activation by hematopoietic cytokine stimulation (17) or following myeloablative 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU) treatment (18). Induction of Socs2 by G-CSF, IL3, GM-CSF, and EPO

Hematopoiesis is a regulated process in which bone marrow
multipotent hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are driven toward
self-renewal or differentiation (1). At the steady state, long-term
HSC (LT-HSC) remain mostly quiescent and rarely divide to
produce short-term HSC (ST-HSC), multipotent precursor
(MPP), and committed progenitors (2), ensuring a continuous

has been documented in cell lines and tissues, including the bone
marrow (19).
In hematologic malignancies (20–22), the JAK–STAT pathways
are frequently deregulated (10, 11), with oncogenic activation of
STAT3 and STAT5 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and of
STAT1 and STAT5 in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL)
and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML; ref. 20), with potential
involvement of SOCS2.
Here, we have uncovered a novel role for SOCS2 in the
regulation of HSC functions in settings of bone marrow myelopoietic stress response and, by thorough analysis of SOCS2
expression in human hematopoietic malignancies, we have identiﬁed SOCS2 deregulation as part of a stemness-related molecular
signature characterizing unfavorable acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemia subsets.

Materials and Methods
Mice
Socs2/ mice were obtained from Dr. C. Farquharson [The
Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies,
University of Edinburgh, Roslin, United Kingdom] and backcrossed to C57BL/6NCrl for 10 generations. Six- to 8-week-old
age- and sex-matched wild-type (wt) and Socs2/ littermates were
used for experiments. C57BL/6NCrl mice were purchased from
Charles River. CD45.1 mice were bred in our animal facility.
Experiments were performed according to local ethical guidelines.
5-FU myeloablation
Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 150 mg/kg body
weight of 5-FU (TEVA). White blood cells (WBC) were counted
on blood samples collected in heparinized tubes and counts were
expressed as WBC/mL of blood.
Cell preparation and bone marrow assays
Bone marrow cells were ﬂushed from tibias and femurs and
spleens were mechanically disrupted in PBS and passed through
70-mm cell strainers (BD). Erythrocytes were lysed and remaining
cells were resuspended in PBS. For puriﬁcation of bone marrow
lineage-negative cells (Lin), we used mouse lineage cell depletion kit (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufacturer's instructions. Details about serial bone marrow transplantation (BMT)
experiments, in vitro colony-forming cell assay, in vitro cytokine
stimulation, FACS, and phospho-STAT5 staining are included in
the Supplementary Methods.
Histopathology and IHC
Histopathologic analyses on mouse tissues were performed on
sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin. IHC on human
bone marrow was performed as previously described (23) using a
speciﬁc anti-human SOCS2 antibody (Abcam). Detailed description of the analyzed human bone marrow samples is provided in
the Supplementary Methods.
Human public dataset analysis
For computational gene expression proﬁles (GEP) analyses,
public human leukemia datasets were used. Detailed information
about samples and methods used for analysis are included in the
Supplementary Data.
Microarray
For gene expression experiment, wt and Socs2/ LincKitþSca1þ (LKS) from 6 mice/group were individually sorted in TRIzol as

2388 Cancer Res; 75(11) June 1, 2015

described in the Supplementary Data. Bead Chip Array MouseWG-6 v2 (Illumina) was used for transcriptome analysis.
Detailed procedures used for RNA extraction, cDNA ampliﬁcation, microarray, data preprocessing, and analysis are included in
the Supplementary Data. Gene expression data are deposited in
NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus database (accession number
GSE66065).
Lentiviral production and infection of Lin cells
The pReceiver-Lv215 lentiviral vectors containing the fulllength open reading frame (ORF) cDNA of mouse Mef2c
(NM_001170537) and Ikzf1 (NM_001025597) or the empty
vector were purchased from GeneCopoeia. A third-generation
packaging system involving the transfection of four plasmids in
the producer cells, namely two packaging plasmids (pMDLg/
pRRE and pRSV-REV), an envelope plasmid (pMD2-VSV-G),
and the lentiviral transfer vector, was used. Lentiviral stocks
were produced in 293T cells by Ca3PO4 cotransfection of the
four plasmids. Supernatants were collected, passed through a
0.22-mm ﬁlter, and puriﬁed by ultracentrifugation as described
previously (22). Lin cells isolated from wt mice were prestimulated overnight in Stemspan SFEM (STEMCELL Technologies)
supplemented with 100 ng/mL SCF, 100 ng/mL Flt3L, 50 ng/mL
TPO, 20 ng/mL IL3, and then lentiviral particles were added at a
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100. After 24 hours, cells were
washed and cultured without the cytokine cocktail; for positive
control, untransduced cells were left in the presence of cytokines;
48 hours later, cells were collected and lysed in TRIzol and used for
subsequent analysis.
Statistical analysis
Data in the histograms of Figs. 1–4 and 6 were represented as
mean  SEM, and an unpaired two-tailed Student t test was
routinely calculated otherwise speciﬁed in the ﬁgure legends.

Results
Hematopoietic stress responses are deregulated in SOCS2deﬁcient mice
Expression of Socs2 in HSC under basal conditions was high in
LKS multipotent HSC and declined in lineage-committed common myeloid progenitors (CMP), granulocyte/monocyte progenitors (GMP), and megakaryocyte/erythroid progenitors (MEP;
Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B), consistent with Socs2 characterizing the stem cell compartment (13–16, 22, 25). Still, SOCS2
was dispensable for basal hematopoiesis being the bone marrow
composition of wt and Socs2/ mice similar at the steady state
(Supplementary Fig. S1C and S1D). We hypothesized that
SOCS2, as inhibitor of JAK–STAT signaling, could inﬂuence HSC
functions in settings of hematopoietic stress. Therefore, we studied the bone marrow response to myeloablation induced by 5-FU
in wt and Socs2/ mice. After 5-FU, a wave of cytokines is
produced and induces bone marrow regeneration, which occurs
around day 10 (3, 21). Socs2 was rapidly induced in bone marrow
Lin cells (a population enriched for HSC) 1 day after 5-FU
administration and reached 30-fold upregulation after 6 days of
treatment, returning to baseline within day 10 (Fig. 1A). Following 5-FU treatment, WBC counts similarly reached nadir within 4
days, but Socs2/ mice fully recovered between day 7 and 9, while
wt mice recovered at day 11, a time point at which Socs2/ WBC
counts even exceeded baseline (Fig. 1B). At day 14, Socs2/ mice

SOCS2 in Stress-Adapted and Leukemic Hematopoiesis

but not STAT1, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5B, and STAT6 motifs (Supplementary Table S1), we hypothesized that SOCS2 could function
as a negative feedback for STAT5 signaling in HSC upon TPO, IL3,
or GM-CSF stimulation. In wt LKS, TPO, IL3, and GM-CSF induced
rapid phosphorylation of STAT5, peaking 15 minutes after stimulation and rapidly declining to baseline within 120 minutes (Fig.
3A, solid line; refs. 27, 28). Differently, in Socs2/ LKS, STAT5
phosphorylation was enhanced and persisted beyond 120 minutes
following stimulation with TPO or IL3 (Fig. 3A, dotted line), while
a slight anticipation of STAT5 phosphorylation occurred upon GMCSF stimulation. Enhanced STAT5 phosphorylation was also evident in Socs2/ CMP/GMP in response to TPO and GM-CSF,
whereas only slight differences were induced by IL3 (Fig. 3B). In
MEP, only TPO induced phospho-STAT5 but no differences were
found between wt and Socs2/ genotypes (Fig. 3C).
We subsequently tested whether deregulated STAT5 signaling
occurred in vivo in response to 5-FU, accounting for the increased
myelopoietic response. LT-HSC, ST-HSC, MPP, and LK Sca-1
were sorted from wt and Socs2/ bone marrow 6 days after 5-FU
administration and the expression of the STAT5 target genes (23)
Pim2, Il2ra, and Ccn3/Nov was evaluated (17). In the absence of
SOCS2, the expression of Pim2 and Il2ra was higher in ST-HSC,
MPP, and LincKitþSca-1 and that of Ccn3/Nov in ST-HSC (Fig.
3D). Interestingly, no differences were observed in LT-HSC, again
suggesting that SOCS2 inﬂuences differentiating precursors rather
than primitive HSC.
Altogether, these results indicate that in HSC, SOCS2 acts as a
negative regulator of STAT5 signaling.
SOCS2 deﬁciency enhances transient HSC repopulating activity
and causes exhaustion of long-term hematopoietic stemness
Considering that HSC proliferation and stemness maintenance
are inversely correlated programs, we analyzed the impact of
SOCS2 deﬁciency in the setting of repeated bone marrow hematopoietic stress adopting serial BMT. These experiments would let us
evaluate whether the augmented expansion of ST-HSC and MPP
and not of LT-HSC observed in Socs2/ mice under 5-FU pressure
could result in the impairment of LT-HSC functions. According to
the upregulation of Socs2 in hematopoietic precursor in settings of
bone marrow stress, Socs2 was transiently upregulated in Lin
bone marrow cells following BMT (Fig. 4A).
To perform serial BMT, two cohorts of lethally irradiated
(CD45.1) mice received 1  106 total bone marrow cells from wt
or Socs2/ littermates (CD45.2). Ten weeks after primary BMT (I
BMT), bone marrow cells from the chimeric mice were retransplanted into secondary (II BMT) lethally irradiated hosts (CD45.1).
The same procedure was adopted for tertiary and quaternary
transplants (III and IV BMT).
Consistent with enhanced stress response of Socs2/ HSC, the
repopulation of bone marrow hematopoietic parenchyma evaluated histologically after the I BMT was signiﬁcantly enhanced in
Socs2/ bone marrow recipients than wt recipients (Fig. 4B), as
well as the degree of myelopoiesis within the splenic red pulp
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Bone marrow cellularity (Fig. 4C) and

bone marrow engraftment (Fig. 4D), assessed as percentage of
circulating donor-derived CD45.2þ cells 10 weeks after BMT, were
higher in mice receiving Socs2/ bone marrow compared with
mice receiving wt bone marrow in I, II, and III BMT. These effects
were associated to higher frequencies of LKS and LincKitþSca-1
precursors (Fig. 4E) and with enhanced in vitro colony-forming
capacity in recipients of Socs2/ bone marrow than of wt counterpart (Fig. 4F). Within the LincKitþSca-1 subset, the distribution of CMP, GMP, and MEP was conserved in the two groups
of mice (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Enhanced hematopoietic responses observed in mice receiving
Socs2/ bone marrow in BMT from I to III, in turn, resulted in the
exhaustion of LT-HSC repopulating potential in the IV BMT,
which caused reduced survival of mice receiving Socs2/ bone
marrow compared with those receiving wt bone marrow (Fig. 4G).
Such failure in bone marrow hematopoiesis was associated with a
lower fraction of circulating donor hematopoietic cells
(CD45.2þ), particularly of the CD11bþ compartment (Fig.
4H). Further conﬁrming the loss of repopulating potential of
Socs2/ bone marrow at the IV BMT, bone marrow histopathology on long-term survivals (300 days after IV BMT) revealed
hypocellular marrow with scant foci of residual hematopoiesis
in mice receiving Socs2/ bone marrow in comparison with mice
receiving wt bone marrow, which showed a more conspicuous
bone marrow repopulation and diffuse hematopoietic cellularity
(Fig. 4I, top). Consistently, the spleen red pulp of IV BMT with
Socs2/ donor bone marrow showed hemorrhagic appearance
with foci of hemosiderin deposition underlining the failure of the
splenic hematopoiesis, which was preserved in recipients of wt
bone marrow (Fig. 4I, bottom).
The experiments with 5-FU indicated that in the absence of
SOCS2 LKS, speciﬁcally the committed progenitors ST-HSC and
MPP were expanded with consequent reduction in relative frequency of LT-HSC (see Fig. 1). Also in III BMT recipients receiving
Socs2/ bone marrow, the increased frequency of LKS associated
with expanded MPP and/or ST-HSC populations and with
reduced frequency of LT-HSC, and this result was valid using
both the SLAM markers and CD34/FLT3 to identify the populations (Fig. 4J). Such contraction of the LT-HSC compartment in
mice receiving Socs2/ bone marrow was progressively acquired
along with the series of transplantations, with signiﬁcant differences in LT-HSC frequencies starting from the II BMT (Fig. 4K).
Therefore, the absence of SOCS2 caused initial enhanced bone
marrow reconstitution by deregulated expansion of ST-HSC/
MPP, with exhaustion of long-term hematopoietic stemness
resulting in decreased survival of IV BMT recipients of Socs2/
bone marrow.

role in regulating hematopoietic stress responses and in preserving HSC stemness maintenance in vivo, we challenged the hypothesis that its expression could be deregulated in human hematopoietic malignancies. Analyzing public GEP, we found signiﬁcant
differences in SOCS2 expression in human hematopoietic neoplasms with different degree of differentiation, namely
CML, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), AML, and ALL
(ANOVA, P < 0.001), with SOCS2 levels peaking in some AML
and in most ALL cases (Fig. 5A). These results were conﬁrmed by in
situ quantitative immunolocalization analysis of SOCS2 (Fig. 5B).
Speciﬁcally, in normal bone marrow, SOCS2 stained progenitors
populating para-trabecular areas and myeloid precursors in the
interstitium of the inter-trabecular areas (Fig. 5C, black arrows).
No or faint expression was detected in mature cells (blue arrows).
In CML, SOCS2 expression was increased in the expanded myeloid precursors (black arrows) and decreased in clusters of differentiated myeloid elements (blue arrows). In MDS, characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis of the neoplastic clone, SOCS2
marked immature precursors also showing abnormal localization
(black arrows), whereas in AML and ALL, it was expressed in the
blastic population effacing the bone marrow. Thus, the levels of
both SOCS2 transcript and protein were associated with the
immature precursor populations expanding at the expense of the
effective hematopoietic pool.
Considering SOCS2 heterogeneity, we analyzed how SOCS2
expression was modulated in each leukemic subtype. In CML,
SOCS2 mRNA and protein (Supplementary Fig. S4) increased
along progression from chronic phase toward accelerated phase
and blast crisis.
In AML patients, high levels of SOCS2 characterized clones with
speciﬁc cytogenetic lesions such as those with MLL (11q23) and
BCR/ABL1 (t9:22) lesions, which share a dismal prognosis (Fig.
5D). Consistently, elevated SOCS2 levels correlated with reduced
overall survival (OS) in AML patients (Fig. 5E), also within subsets
of AML with normal karyotype enriched in clones with FLT3-ITD
and associated with poor prognosis (Fig. 5F).
In ALL, high SOCS2 characterized more immature subsets,
namely c-ALL/pre-B-ALL or pro-B-ALL, whereas levels of SOCS2
closer to that of normal bone marrow were detected in more
mature B-ALL and in T-ALL (Fig. 5G). Grippingly, also in ALL, the
same subsets with unfavorable cytogenetics, namely those with
MLL abnormalities and those characterized by BCR/ABL1, displayed the highest levels of SOCS2 (Fig. 5H).
SOCS2 marks a stemness-related program in acute leukemias
and is part of IKZF1/Ikaros and MEF2C regulatory networks
AML-associated HSC and leukemic stem cell (LSC) signatures
have been recently described and related to bad prognosis (29).
Considering that the basal expression of SOCS2 is conﬁned to
primitive HSC and that the upregulated SOCS2 expression characterized unfavorable acute leukemias, we hypothesized that
SOCS2 could be part of a stemness program in acute leukemias.
To this aim, we generated a list of genes positively correlated with
SOCS2 in acute leukemias (Supplementary Table S2) and crossmatched the list with the AML HSC/LSC signature (29). We found
a high degree of overlap between the two gene lists (P < 0.001; Fig.
6A) and the shared genes, namely TRAF3IP2, MEF2C, FRMD4B,
BCL11A, COL5A1, ELK3, ERG, PTK2, SPTBN1, and ARPP-19,
corresponding to 32 probe sets, were used to generate a more
restricted gene list of "leukemic stemness- and SOCS2-associated
gene list" (Table 1).

2394 Cancer Res; 75(11) June 1, 2015

Unsupervised clustering of acute leukemia samples according to
this restricted gene list was suitable to group acute leukemias with
SOCS2 levels above (or below) the median value (SOCS250–100),
comprising most ALL and a small subgroup of AML (Fig. 6B).
Speciﬁcally within AML samples, cases characterized by MLL
(11q23) and t(15;17) cytogenetic lesions formed deﬁned clusters
associated with high or low SOCS2, respectively (Fig. 6C). Similarly, within ALL samples, the "leukemic stemness- and SOCS2associated gene list" pinpointed patients with E2A/PBX1 translocation and low SOCS2 expression and patients with MLL or BCR/
ABL aberrations and high SOCS2 expression (Fig. 6D).
We also interrogated the list of SOCS2-related genes to identify
common regulatory networks shared by SOCS2 and its correlates.
Following the hypothesis that deregulated SOCS2 expression
could depend on STAT5 activation, we searched for known STAT5
targets identiﬁed in HSC (17, 30). More speciﬁcally, only two of
the 99 SOCS2 correlates belonged to STAT5-predicted targets (Fig.
6E) according to C3 motif genesets collection of MSigDB (Supplementary Table S1), suggesting that upregulated SOCS2 was not
a mere bystander result of JAK2–STAT5 activation.
Rather, we noted that several SOCS2 best correlates, including
CTGF, MEF2C, DNTT, CD79B, ADD3, CD24, LIG, BLNK, and
SOCS2 itself, were predicted or validated target genes of the
transcriptional factor IKZF1/Ikaros, which plays key roles in
normal hematopoiesis and B-cell lymphopoiesis (31) and that
is involved in AML (32), ALL (33) and CML blast crisis (34).
Moreover, MEF2C, encoding the transcription factor myocyte
enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C), is one of the best correlates of
SOCS2 and is also a target of Ikaros. MEF2C has similar expression
pattern of SOCS2 in normal HSC (35) and is ectopically expressed
in MLL-rearranged AML (36). Therefore, we evaluated whether a
regulatory network existed involving SOCS2, Ikaros and/or
MEF2C in acute leukemias by ARACNe reverse engineering analysis (37). We determined transcriptional networks of IKZF1/
Ikaros and MEF2C in bone marrow myeloid and lymphoid
precursors, AML and ALL, and identiﬁed genes whose expression
was signiﬁcantly related with them; these genes were deﬁned as
"ﬁrst neighbors" of the network representing putative transcriptional targets of IKZF1/Ikaros and MEF2C (Supplementary Tables
S3 and S4). Of note, SOCS2 was one of the ﬁrst neighbor of both
IKZF1/Ikaros and MEF2C (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4) in
normal HSC and acute leukemias, but not in mature B cells, and
related malignancies (non-Hodgkin lymphomas), conﬁrming the
speciﬁcity of these molecular interactions in hematopoietic precursor malignancies (Supplementary Tables S5 and S6). MEF2C
was a target of IKZF1/Ikaros sharing with IKZF1 a network of 530
targets (Supplementary Fig. S5). Among the SOCS2 correlates that
were identiﬁed as ﬁrst neighbors, 84 of 87 IKZF1/Ikaros putative
targets were also MEF2C targets, whereas other 90 genes were
exclusively MEF2C targets (Fig. 6F and G), suggesting a more
direct dependency of SOCS2 on MEF2C.
Common SOCS2-correlated programs are engaged in human
acute leukemias and in in vivo experimental HSC stress
Prompted by in situ analyses of human acute leukemias revealing the link between SOCS2 and, primarily, MEF2C, we investigated whether such link exists also in a condition of hematopoietic stress in vivo. To this aim, we generated GEP of murine LKS
sorted from wt and Socs2/ bone marrow 6 days after 5-FU
treatment. Supervised comparison revealed 51 differently
expressed genes (DEG) with a fold change 2 and P < 0.001

(Supplementary Table S7). Among them, eight were upregulated
and 43 were downregulated in Socs2/ as compared with wt
counterpart.
In the absence of SOCS2, there was a positive enrichment of
gene sets encoding for proteins involved in the translational
machinery, in line with a more active metabolism of Socs2/
LKS in response to myeloablation, whereas among the pathways
negatively enriched in Socs2/ LKS, many had relevance in cancer
and others were linked to cytokine response (Supplementary
Table S8 and Supplementary Fig. S6).
We then investigated similarities between gene programs
differentially regulated in human leukemias according to
SOCS2 gene expression and the 51 DEG of murine LKS under
hematopoietic stress. We documented a signiﬁcant correspondence between the cellular programs enriched in the two
signatures as deﬁned by GSEA. In particular, 10 "curated
genesets" (Supplementary Table S9) and 7 "oncogenic signatures" (Supplementary Table S10) were enriched using the 51
DEG and 2 out of 10 of the former and seven out of eight of the
latter categories were also enriched considering SOCS2-correlated genes in human leukemias (Supplementary Tables S9 and
S10, yellow highlights).
Moreover, considering the 79 probe sets corresponding to the
36 out of 51 murine DEG that are detectable in the human arrays,
33 were MEF2C putative targets identiﬁed by reverse engineering
in human acute leukemias (corresponding to 11 genes), and only
8 of these 33 probe sets (corresponding to SOCS2 itself and PATZ1
genes) were also IKZF1/Ikaros ﬁrst neighbors (Fig. 6H).
Collectively, human reverse engineering and murine GEP
results were strongly indicative that MEF2C could be a key

regulator of SOCS2 expression in HSC in different setting, while
suggesting a less prominent or indirect role for Ikaros. To conﬁrm
this potential mechanism, we lentivirally transduced murine
bone marrow Lin with Mef2c and Ikaros ORF and conﬁrmed
the expression of the two transcripts by qPCR (Supplementary Fig.
S7). The overexpression of MEF2C was able to signiﬁcantly
upregulate Socs2 transcription, similarly to the induction mediated by cytokine cocktail stimulation, whereas Ikaros expression
was unable to affect the transcription of Socs2. Therefore, in HSC,
the expression of Socs2, besides being regulated by cytokine
stimulation, is also controlled by MEF2C.

Discussion
HSC self-renewal and differentiation in response to hematopoietic stress are regulated by cytokines signaling through JAK–
STAT pathways (38). Our report describes for the ﬁrst time
the active role of SOCS2 in regulating HSC functions during
nonhomeostatic conditions such as bone marrow stress or malignant hematopoiesis. In this setting, we have identiﬁed a new
regulatory mechanism inducing Socs2 independently from STAT
pathways while depending on MEF2C.
As negative regulator of the JAK2–STAT5 pathway, SOCS2
keeps in check stress-induced HSC response avoiding uncontrolled ampliﬁcation of ST-HSC, MPP, and committed precursors
thus preserving long-term hematopoiesis. Accordingly, we demonstrate that SOCS2 deﬁciency is associated with aberrant expansion of hematopoietic progenitors following 5-FU myeloablation
and with the impoverishment of the stem cell pool in response to
serial BMT. Indeed, SOCS2 deﬁciency enhanced bone marrow
reconstitution in I, II, and III BMT recipients and, eventually, loss
of long-term hematopoietic function, with decreased survival of
IV BMT recipients. This was related with the composition of the
LKS pool that in Socs2/ bone marrow chimeras was characterized by higher ST-HSC and MPP but reduced LT-HSC frequencies.
SOCS2 is overexpressed in primitive HSC (13–16) compared
with more differentiated populations, both in human (13–16 and
mouse (22, 25), suggesting that basal SOCS2 expression could
contribute to stemness maintenance. Nevertheless, Hansen and
colleagues (25) published that Socs2-deﬁcient mice had normal
reconstitution capacity in primary and secondary competitive
BMT experiments. Our kinetic analysis of Socs2 expression following the bone marrow myeloablation (BMT or 5-FU) clearly
indicated that SOCS2 overexpression and SOCS2-negative regulation of STAT5 are transient and occur within 1 day after myeloablative treatment. Of note, the analysis of bone marrow
composition reported by Hansen and colleagues (25) was performed 4 weeks after BMT, a time point at which bone marrow
homeostatic hematopoiesis is restored.
We have dissected in vitro the dominant mechanism exerted by
SOCS2 over HSC expansion: in conditions of hematopoietic stress
or upon triggering with IL3, TPO, or GM-CSF, SOCS2 is transiently upregulated and primarily tunes JAK2–STAT5 activation, a
pathway known to regulate cytokine-mediated HSC response
(39) and self-renewal (26). Increased SOCS2 expression occurs
also in bone marrow of patients treated with hematopoietic
cytokines, suggesting a clear connection in hematopoietic cytokine response between mice and humans. However, we cannot
exclude that in HSC other cytokines and/or other STATs could be
regulated by SOCS2, nor that other SOCS family members, such
as the known STAT5 regulators SOCS1 and SOCS3, could play

redundant roles (6). Other pathways are also activated by hematopoietic cytokines such as the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
(PI3K) pathway and the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)
pathway. This multiplicity of checkpoints is necessary to maintain
bone marrow integrity and suggests that the differences observed
in our experiments, although statistically signiﬁcant, might be
attenuated by redundancy of the system.
Altered Socs2 expression has emerged from GEP of several
hematologic malignancies. In CML patients, upregulated SOCS2
was found in CD34þ cells during the transition from the chronic
phase to the blast phase and has been associated with poor
prognosis (40, 41). In contrast, a mouse model of BCR/ABL1–
induced CML shows the same incidence regardless SOCS2 deﬁciency (25). However, these data cannot be considered conclusive
given that such model is characterized by a short latency and rapid
progression, representing a suboptimal setting to appreciate any
potential phenotype related with SOCS2 effects.
The signiﬁcance of SOCS2 modulation in hematologic malignancies other than CML, including MDS, AML, and ALL has never
been thoroughly addressed. Our data conﬁrm SOCS2 upregulation along different CML blast-enrichment phases, and document
for the ﬁrst time that SOCS2 increased expression characterizes
speciﬁc AML and ALL subsets with unfavorable BCR/ABL or MLL
lesions and with the mixed lineage phenotype, a feature of
aberrant hematopoietic stemness. Of interest, ALL and SOCS2
have never been associated before. In AML, we could also demonstrate that high SOCS2 levels correlate with poor prognosis. At
the molecular level, SOCS2 and the coregulated genes signiﬁcantly overlapped with those belonging to AML-associated HSC and
LSC signatures (29).
In patients carrying mutations and translocations associated
with constitutive activation of JAK2/STAT5, such as BCR-ABL or
FLT3-ITD, high SOCS2 possibly reﬂects the chronic phosphorylation of STAT5. Accordingly, the expression of SOCS2 is downregulated in CML patients with BCR-ABL following treatment with
the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (42), and patients refractory
to the treatment displayed higher SOCS2 compared with treatment-sensitive ones (41). Similarly, in AML patients carrying the
FLT3-ITD mutation, induction of SOCS1, SOCS2, and SOCS3 is
linked with STAT5 activation, in line with the concept of SOCS2
functioning as a negative regulator of FLT3 (43).
Our reverse engineering analysis for the ﬁrst time suggests a
novel SOCS2 regulatory network that is independent from STAT
activation and that involves primarily MEF2C and less consistently Ikaros. At the steady state, MEF2C and SOCS2 expression
patterns are overlapping, being high in LKS and CMP and downregulated in GMP and MEP; in hematologic diseases, MEF2C
upregulation is described for AML with MLL lesions (those
associated to highest SOCS2), where it contributes to confer
stemness features (35). Ikaros is a transcriptional regulator that
controls key events for lymphoid differentiation in MPP and its
dominant-negative isoforms or deletions have been reported in
cases of infant and childhood ALL (44, 45) as well as in blast crisis

of Philadelphia positive CML (34). Interestingly, GEP analysis of
MEF2C competent versus deﬁcient MPP indicated a direct relationship between MEF2C and Ikaros (46); however, such relationship has never been identiﬁed in acute leukemias neither it
has been associated with SOCS2. Our GEP analyses clearly indicate that SOCS2-related transcriptional programs and MEF2C are
functionally associated also in murine HSC under stress conditions. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrated that MEF2C
expression in HSC is sufﬁcient to upregulate Socs2 even in the
absence of cytokine stimulation.
Altogether, we have uncovered that SOCS2 is part of a transcriptional program with prognostic relevance in acute leukemias,
and identiﬁed MEF2C as a novel key factor that is complementary
to STAT5 in regulating SOCS2 expression in HSC. This novel
MEF2C-mediated regulation of SOCS2 might exert a pivotal role
in the absence of cytokine stimulation, such as in HSC at the
steady state and the aberrant expression of MEF2C, SOCS2 and
the correlated genes might confer leukemic stemness features to
the neoplastic hematopoietic clones. Hence, this emerging network has clinical relevance and deserves further investigation.
