Angiopoietin-2: An Attractive Target for Improved
Antiangiogenic Tumor Therapy
Damien Gerald1, Sudhakar Chintharlapalli2, Hellmut G. Augustin3,4, and Laura E. Benjamin1

Abstract
Anti-VEGF pathway therapies primarily target immature blood vessels in tumors. However, emerging
approaches to combine with targeted therapies impacting the later stages of remodeling and vessel maturation
are expected to improve clinical efﬁcacy by expanding the target vessel population. The angiopoietin/Tie ligand/
receptor system is a prototypic regulator of vessel remodeling and maturation. Angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) appears to
be a particularly attractive therapeutic target. In fact, the experimental proof-of-concept showing improved
efﬁcacy when VEGF and Ang2-targeting therapies are combined has been solidly established in preclinical
models, and several Ang2-targeting drugs are in clinical trials. However, rational development of these secondgeneration combination therapies is hampered by a limited understanding of the biological complexity that is
generated from agonistic and antagonistic Ang/Tie signaling. This review discusses recent mechanistic advances
in angiopoietin signaling, particularly in light of the recent study published on REGN910 and summarizes the
status quo of Ang2-targeting therapies. In light of the clariﬁed partial agonist function of Ang2, we propose that
clarity on the expression proﬁle of the angiopoietin ligands and Tie1 and Tie2 receptors in subsets of cancer
vessels and cancer cells will provide clearer hypotheses for more focused rational clinical trials to exploit this
seminal pathway and improve current antiangiogenic therapies. Cancer Res; 73(6); 1649–57. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
In the last 9 years, antiangiogenic therapy has become part of
standard antitumor treatment. However, the clinical efﬁcacy of
such therapies is limited, and it appears that the full therapeutic potential of antiangiogenic intervention has not been
fully exploited. Moreover, the mechanistic goals of antiangiogenic intervention are presently less clear than ever. While
concepts developed by Folkman in the 1970s suggested that
antiangiogenic therapy was supposed to starve tumors to
death by driving the tumor-associated vasculature into regression (1), we ﬁnd that clinically established anti-VEGF/VEGF
receptor therapies primarily promote stable disease by preferentially targeting the most immature blood vessels leaving
behind normalized and resistant blood vessels (2). The enigmatic question around the importance of vascular regression,

tumor vessel normalization, or a spatiotemporal combination
of both mechanisms for the efﬁcacy to antiangiogenic intervention has increased to the forefront of basic and applied
vascular biology research to guide future pharmaceutical
development. One of the most challenging questions at the
moment is: What drug combinations improve the clinical
efﬁcacy of targeted VEGF pathway therapies without causing
toxicity by damaging the mature, resting organ vasculature
outside tumors?

Recent Advances in the Mechanistic
Understanding of Angiopoietin-2 Function
The vascular receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2 is physiologically
activated by its agonistic ligand Ang1. Ang1- and Tie2-deﬁcient
mice die in midgestation around embryonic day 10.5 as a
consequence of perturbed vessel remodeling and maturation
(3). The phenotypic similarity between Ang1 ligand and Tie2
receptor–deﬁcient mice has supported the concept that Ang1
is the single, nonredundant agonistic ligand of Tie2 (4, 5). Using
similar logic, the antagonistic mode of action of the second
angiopoietin ligand, angiopoietin-2 (Ang2), was inferred from
genetic manipulation experiments in mice: Ang2-overexpressing transgenic mice essentially phenocopy the midgestational
embryonic lethal phenotype of Ang1-deﬁcient mice (6). In
other words, too much Ang2 resembles too little Ang1. In addition, correlative expression of Ang2 at times of vessel regression in ovaries, tumor vascular cooption, and hyaloid vessel
regression supported the concept that the dominant biologic
role of Ang2 is destabilization of established blood vessels
through the interruption of Tie2 signaling, as a prerequisite to
sprouting angiogenesis in the presence of proangiogenic

stimulation or physiologic vascular regression in the absence
of such stimuli (7–10). The molecular mechanism of this vessel
destabilization phenotype has recently been bolstered to
include the Ang2-induced internalization and degradation of
endothelial cell surface integrins, which may eventually drive
the cells into apoptosis (anoikis; ref. 11). The antagonistic
mode of Ang2 function is also supported by the positional
presentation of the angiopoietin ligands; whereas Ang1 is
produced by periendothelial cells, including pericytes, to act
in a paracrine manner, Ang2 is almost exclusively produced by
endothelial cells and acts on endothelial cells in an autocrine
manner, possibly even involving intracrine signaling mechanisms (12). In fact, Ang2 is not just produced by endothelial cells,
but endothelial cells store it in Weibel–Palate bodies where it
can be rapidly released in seconds to minutes to enable the
responsiveness of endothelial cells to angiogenic, inﬂammatory, and other cytokines (13, 14). Tools to examine the impact
of Ang2 on Tie2 phosphorylation are poor and have hampered
extensive interrogation of this hypothesis; however, there is
one study in which transgenic overexpression of Ang2 in
endothelial cells was shown to be capable of reducing Tie2
phosphorylation in vivo (15). Ang2 production by endothelial
cells is strongly regulated at the transcriptional level. In fact,
almost any form of endothelial cell activation leads to upregulation of Ang2 mRNA. The mRNA induction of Ang2 in tumor
endothelium has made Ang2 a very attractive circulating
biomarker of angiogenic activation (e.g., ref. 16; summary in
ref. 3). Thus, while the in vivo evidence for a predominately
antagonistic mode of action of Ang2 is overwhelming, there is
still only very limited examination of the molecular mechanisms of this phenotype.
As a challenge to the antagonist hypothesis, a number of
cellular studies have provided compelling evidence that Ang2
may under certain conditions also be able to act agonistically
on its receptor Tie2 (e.g., ref. 17). The typically higher concentrations of Ang2 required to observe this agonism have
raised questions around the physiologic relevance of the in
vitro data. However, there are a series of in vivo data suggesting
that there are cellular contexts in which Ang2 may offer a
proangiogenic function through agonism of the Tie2 receptor.
One example is the situation in lymphatics, in which deletion of
Ang2 led to lymphatic dysfunction with chylous ascites and
edema. This lymphatic phenotype was corrected by replacing
endogenous Ang2 with a cDNA for Ang1 (18). Thus, Ang2
seemed to substitute for Ang1-agonistic functions in lymphatics in vivo, which may be deprived of Ang1 signaling due to
their low pericyte coverage. Similarly, in monocytes there is
evidence of agonist activity by Ang2. A subpopulation of Tie2expressing monocytes (TEM) are associated with tumor blood
vessels and exhibit proangiogenic activity, which could be
inhibited by Tie2 silencing or Ang2 neutralization (19, 20). In
vitro, TEMs migrated toward Ang2, which induced Tie2 phosphorylation (21). Thus, Ang2 also functioned as an agonist of
Tie2 in these cells.
To further complicate the question of Tie2 antagonism
versus agonism, there is a series of reports that incorporate
the orphan receptor Tie1 into the context of Ang2 function.
Deletion of Tie1 in mice results in defects of vascular

integrity, localized hemorrhaging, and cardiac underdevelopment, indicating its essential role in vascular maintenance
(22). Tie1 is highly expressed by arteries and their associated
capillaries at branching points and is induced by disturbed
ﬂow, suggesting dynamic physiologic regulation of Tie1 (23).
Multiple studies have addressed potential cross-talk
between Tie1 and Tie2, as well as feedback regulatory loops
that respond differently to Ang1 and Ang2 (24, 25). These
data are still emerging but a take-home hypothesis generated by Seegar and colleagues suggests that in the presence
of Tie1, Ang2 is unable to activate Tie2; however, loss of Tie1
reveals the agonist capabilities of Ang2 in vitro (26). These
tantalizing data await a more physiologic context and conﬁrmation in vivo.
Ang2 has recently been shown to exert proangiogenic
functions in a Tie2-independent manner. Angiogenic endothelial tip cells downregulate the Tie2 receptor and Ang2
signals in these cells through activated integrins to promote
focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling and, subsequently,
angiogenic sprouting (27). While not acting through an
agonism of Tie2, this is nevertheless an unexpected proangiogenic function of Ang2 where neutralization of the ligand
could be beneﬁcial in a cancer context. It is notable that in
terms of Ang2 functions, both its role in destabilizing a
mature vasculature to facilitate cooption and neoangiogenesis and its role in promoting integrin stimulation of sprouting tip cells suggest that the consequences of Ang2 blockade
will likely be contextual with different net outcomes on
sprouting Tie2-negative tip cells and more mature Tie2expressing stalk and phalanx endothelial cells (see Fig. 1).
This is consistent with published reports using neutralizing
molecules to Ang2 where tumor growth and retinal sprouting are blocked (e.g., ref. 28). These studies use antibodies
that were developed to block Tie2 interactions and often to
block the in vitro activation of Tie2 that can be observed in
the absence of Ang1, suggesting that the antibodies or
peptides block the Ang2–Tie2–interacting domain. It is
unclear whether the observed Ang2 interactions with integrins use the same binding domains and whether this function is sensitive to the currently available blocking antibodies and peptides to Ang2 in therapeutic development
described below.
In a recent issue of Cancer Research, Daly and colleagues
reveal insights into the complexity of Ang/Tie signaling that
provides a model for the contextuality of Ang2-antagonistic
and -agonistic functions of Ang2 on Tie2 (Fig. 1). The authors
show that a selective antibody to Ang2 (REGN910) can
decrease tumor growth in a manner that is reversed by
high-dose administration of an engineered form of Ang1 called
Ang1-F1-Fc-F1 (which has an IC50 of 9.7 nmol/L to Tie2 and is
a forced tetramer), hinting that Tie2 signaling was attenuated
(29, 30). This Ang1 construct has previously been shown to
maximally activate Tie2 in vitro and in vivo and to block
mustard oil–induced vascular leak. While this report falls short
of directly showing the impact of REGN910 on activation of
Tie2 by Ang2 in vivo, the tumor growth and resulting gene
expression data presented, along with the above described
cellular contexts in which Ang2 can have proangiogenic and

Figure 1. Endothelial cell phenotypes during tumor angiogenesis. A,
endothelial cells during angiogenesis maintain distinct functions and
acquire speciﬁc phenotypes during the individual steps of the angiogenic
cascade. Sprouting tip cells (1) have an invasive ﬁlopodia-rich
promigratory phenotype. They sense the gradient of angiogenic
cytokines and migrate towards the angiogenic stimuli. Tip cells are
followed by stalk cells (2), which proliferate and remodel to establish
lumen-forming microvessels. Tip cell– and stalk cell–derived PDGFB is
the best characterized pericyte-recruiting cytokine during angiogenesis.
Pericyte recruitment leads to microvessel maturation. Loosely attached
pericytes cover remodeling phalanx cells (3). Fully mature phalanx
endothelial cells (4) are in intimate contact with pericytes, which control
the quiescent endothelial cell phenotype. B, application of the tip cell/
stalk cell/phalanx cell model of angiogenesis applied to the partial Ang2
agonist concept for cancer: The mature organ vasculature outside
tumors (4) expresses Tie2, and the cells are surrounded by Ang1producing pericytes. There is low-level Ang2 production, which is stored
in quiescent phalanx endothelial cells, that can be induced and secreted
upon activation. Release of Ang2 would likely result in a quenching of
Ang1/Tie2 signal transduction indicative of an antagonistic mode of
action. Conversely, the most immature tip cell vasculature (1)
downregulates Tie2 and upregulates Ang2 creating a milieu in which
Ang2 can signal agonistically through integrins. The exact positional
information on Ang ligands and Tie receptors in stalk cells and in
remodeling phalanx cells awaits further analysis, but it is most likely that
Tie2- and Ang2-expressing endothelial cells in a low-Ang1 environment
could be found in this zone (2, 3) where the partial agonist Ang2 results in a
net activation for Tie2. The function and the positional expression of the
Ang/Tie2 response, including the role of Tie1 in this context, similarly
await further clariﬁcation.

possibly even Tie2-agonistic activity, provide a compelling case
to revisit the simplistic view of the Yin-Yang of Ang1 and Ang2.
The data presented in the article by Daly and colleagues
are compatible with a partial agonist model of Ang2 function. In line with classical pharmacologic concepts, the
partial agonist competes with the strong agonist. In the
presence of the strong agonist (in this case, Ang1), the partial

www.aacrjournals.org

agonist Ang2 quenches the signal induced by the strong
agonist, thereby exerting an inhibitory activity. In the
absence of the strong agonist, the weak agonist may function
as receptor-stimulating ligand. This model of Ang2 as a
partial agonist can perhaps provide a unifying hypothesis
to explain some of the contextuality of Ang/Tie biology. For
example, the embryonic lethal phenotype of Ang1-deﬁcient
mice may be explained by the fact that Ang2 is only later
expressed in endothelial cells during embryonic development. Conversely, the puzzling observation that Ang1 deletion in adult mice did not result in overt pathology unless
the mice were pathologically challenged (31) may well
be attributed by a compensatory agonistic function elicited
by the partial antagonist Ang2, which would be a testable
hypothesis. Clearly, the model proposed by Daly and colleagues provokes a long list of experiments on the contextuality
of Ang/Tie function, which emerges at a time when better
reagents for the tracing of receptor and ligand expression
and for the conditional mutagenesis of the ligands and
receptors becomes more readily available. An accelerated
pace in the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of
Ang/Tie signaling in the tumor context holds great promise
to enable the rational translation of Ang/Tie pathway therapeutics into clinical application.

Current Therapeutics Targeting the Angiopoietin
and Tie2 Pathway
There are no selective Tie2 kinase inhibitors in clinical
development; however, several approved agents show cellular
activity against this pathway. Regorafenib is one of several
small-molecule VEGFR2 inhibitors that also exhibit some
activity against Tie2. Regorafenib has a 3 to 10 nmol/L cellular
activity against VEGFR2, Ret, Kit, and Raf and modest (30–150
nmol/L) cellular activity against ﬁbroblast growth factor
receptor (FGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor
(PDGFR), and Tie2. Phase III trials showed a signiﬁcant
increase in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival
in second-line metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) leading to
the accelerated approval of the drug (32). Cabozopanib, a
related VEGFR TKIs that is also active against Ret, Tie2, and
other kinases, is now approved in medullary thyroid cancer
(33). Similarly, MGCD-265 is a Ron, Tie2, cMET, and a VEGFR1/
2/3 inhibitor that is being currently tested in phase II trials in
patients with a variety of advanced metastatic malignancies
(34). In addition, there are several small-molecule inhibitors
(ACTB-1003, CEP-11981, ARRY-614) in phase I trials. As it is
unlikely that any of these molecules has dominant impact via
Tie2 signaling, the remainder of this discussion will focus on
the variety of more selective biologics currently under
development.
There are 2 types of biologics targeting the angiopoietins whose references can be found in Table 1. The
ﬁrst and most advanced are peptide based, using peptides
with high afﬁnity and differing selectivity to Ang1 and
Ang2. These peptides are either linked to an Fc domain or
to an irrelevant antibody. Trebananib (AMG-386) and
PF04856884 (CVX-060) are the 2 peptide-based traps that
are most advanced, in phase III and 2 trials, respectively.

Trebananib is a peptide–Fc fusion protein (peptibody)
that blocks the interaction of both Ang1 and Ang2 to
Tie2 with an afﬁnity of 0.67 nmol/L by BiAcore (35). Several phase II trials were conducted with trebananib in which
some hints of clinical efﬁcacy and experience with pharmacokinetics (PK)/pharmacodynamics (PD) has led to
further development in phase III, particularly in ovarian
cancer. Phase II data showed an improved response rate
but no difference in PFS when trebananib was combined
with sorafenib in patients with metastatic clear cell renal
carcinoma (RCC; ref. 36). However, an encouraging dose–
response effect was observed when trebananib was used
in combination with paclitaxel in patients with advanced
recurrent epithelial ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer
(37). PK/PD analysis of the phase II data suggest that
maximum beneﬁt in PFS may not have been reached
with a trebananib dose of 10 mg/kg once every week and
predict that a dose of 15 mg/kg once every week may
provide greater exposure and may yield further improvements in PFS (38). The 3 phase III trials now ongoing
at 15 mg/kg once-a-week dose of trebananib combine
either paclitaxel (NCT01204749/TRINOVA-1), pegylated
liposomal doxorubicin (NCT01281254/TRINOVA-2), or
a combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin
(NCT01493505/TRINOVA-3). TRINOVA-1 and -2 are in

PF04856884 (CVX-060) is a CovX-body speciﬁc to Ang2.
CovX-bodies are an antibody platform that are generated by
linking an irrelevant (aldolase) IgG to a target-binding
peptide. CVX-060 has a binding afﬁnity of 4.9 nmol/L to
Ang2, similar to published afﬁnity for Ang2 to Tie2. The
peptide is linked using a branched azetidinone (AZD). The
antibody scaffold imparts IgG-like half-life, and distribution
and the peptide pharmacophores are responsible for functional activities (6, 40). CVX-060 inhibited tumor growth,
tumor microvessel density, and intratumor proangiogenic
Tie2/CD11b-positive cells (TEMs) in Colo205 xenograft
tumors. Even greater efﬁcacy (>80%) was observed when
combined with sunitinib, sorafenib, bevacizumab, irinotecan, or docetaxel in this model (35). Signiﬁcant mean
decreases in tumor blood ﬂow assessed by Ktrans (DCE-MRI)
and increase in serum Ang2 levels were observed in a phase I
study of CVX-060. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was
not deﬁned and the most common adverse event was
fatigue. PK/PD analysis has recommended 15 mg/kg once

Ang2 levels in this study are due to peptibody binding and
accumulation of stabilized complexes in the circulation as

Angiopoietin-2 as Antiangiogenic Target

expression. A phase II study is ongoing in combination with
axitinib in patients with previously treated metastatic RCC
(NCT01441414; ref. 39). In general, peptides tend to have
lower afﬁnities for Ang2 binding than antibodies, and understanding how competitive they are as neutralizing agents
clinically awaits further development of the antibodies
described below.
The second type of biologic therapeutics are antibodies.
Two selective anti-Ang2 antibodies are in development,
MEDI-3617 (AstraZeneca) and REGN-910 (Sanoﬁ). Both
MEDI-3617 and REGN-910 have ongoing phase I dose-escalation studies as single agents or in combination with other
chemotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors
(NCT01248949 and NCT01271972). MEDI-3617 reported
drug-related adverse events (% of patients) including fatigue
(24%), diarrhea (19%), nausea (19%), dysgeusia (14%), and
headache (14%), all of which were grade II (42). AMG-780,
an antibody that binds both Ang1 and Ang2, is also in phase
I development (NCT01137552) (39). In addition, Roche has
a preclinical stage CrossMab, which is a bispeciﬁc antibody
that binds and neutralizes both Ang2 and VEGF-A. This
bifunctional approach is notable, as several preclinical
studies have shown an advantage to dual inhibition of both
VEGF/VEGFR and Ang/Tie2 pathways, including the study
by Daly and colleagues, in a recent issue of Cancer Research
(29, 42).

Outstanding Questions and Future Directions for
Rational Intervention
The prominent upregulation of Ang2 in the vasculature of
most solid tumors makes Ang2 an attractive candidate for
therapeutic intervention. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that Ang2 may augment the activity of VEGF-targeted
therapies without clear evidence of enhanced toxicity. However, the pleiotropic activities of Ang2 in blood, lymphatic, and
myeloid biology, as well as complexities in receptor use and
contextual presentation demand further investigation to clarify the critical aspects of Ang2 that are drivers in cancer
progression. Regardless of which effects turn out to be dominant in cancer, current evidence supports the therapeutic
rationale to antagonize Ang2.
In tumor angiogenesis, Ang2 appears to function as a
potent Tie2 agonist based on the ability of Ang1 to counter
the efﬁcacy of anti-Ang2 antibodies. However, modulation of Tie2 activation in tumor vessels remains to be
explored (29). Ectopic administration of Ang1 can substitute for Ang2 function, raising the question of the difference
between autocrine Ang2 (released by endothelial cells subjected to stress) or paracrine Ang2. This may be particularly
relevant in some tumor settings where Ang2 is produced by
tumor cells. Ang2 has also been associated with tumor
metastases. High Ang2 expression in primary human breast
cancer specimens correlates with an increased metastatic
phenotype (44). Furthermore, overexpression of Ang2 in
MCF-7 promoted their metastasis to lymph nodes and lungs,
an effect postulated to result from direct interaction
between Ang2 and beta1 integrins on tumor cells (much
the way Ang2 was reported to facilitate sprouting of Tie2-

negative tip cells; refs. 11, 27). The delineation of autocrine
versus paracrine presentation of Ang2 still needs to be
carefully investigated.
The partial agonist concept developed by Daly and colleagues raises important questions as to when and where
angiopoietin ligands and Tie2 receptor are expressed in
different tumor settings (Fig. 1; ref. 1). Endothelial cells in
mature tumor-associated vessels express Tie2 in an Ang1rich/Ang2-poor microenvironment. When this balance is
disturbed by increased expression of Ang2 (a weak agonist),
the net result is a paradoxical decrease in Tie2 phosphorylation. Conversely, endothelial cells in the most immature
tumor vasculature downregulate Tie2 expression, while at
the same time upregulating Ang2 and favoring proangiogenic Ang2 function through integrin signaling. The contextual presentation of Ang1 in tumors is not well-deﬁned,
but an intermediate zone of Tie2- and Ang2-expressing
endothelial cells in an Ang1-low microenvironment could
likely be present in the actively proliferating stalk cell zone
(Fig. 1).
Extrapolating from rapidly growing mouse tumors with a
very immature vasculature, it is widely believed that the tumor
vasculature is low in Ang1-producing pericytes. However, this
is most likely an overstatement as microvessels in human
tumors are often well-invested by pericytes. These pericytes
may not be as tightly associated with endothelial cells as in
resting blood vessels but are widely detected in human tumors
(45). In fact, there are distinct differences in the pericyte
coverage of different human tumor blood vessels. It is tempting, therefore, to speculate that pericyte-mediated differences
in tumor blood vessel maturation could account for differences
in the efﬁcacy of immature blood vessels targeted by antiVEGF/VEGFR therapies. These concepts strongly support a
rationale for inducing vascular maturation as part of the
treatment of tumors.
The development of Ang/Tie pathway drugs and the deciphering of the intricate details of Ang/Tie signaling occur at a
time when the goals of antiangiogenic intervention are under
serious consideration. Understanding the cross-talk between
vessel maturation and remodeling (i.e., Ang/Tie) and primarily
sprouting angiogenesis-inducing pathways (i.e., VEGF) holds
great promise to rationally develop safe and improved antiangiogenic cancer therapy.
