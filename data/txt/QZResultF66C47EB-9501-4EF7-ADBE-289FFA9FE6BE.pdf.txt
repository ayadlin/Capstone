Abstract
The translation initiation factor eIF4E is an oncogene that is
commonly overexpressed in primary breast cancers and metastases. In this article, we report that a pharmacologic inhibitor of
eIF4E function, ribavirin, safely and potently suppresses breast
tumor formation. Ribavirin administration blocked the growth
of primary breast tumors in several murine models and reduced
the development of lung metastases in an invasive model.
Mechanistically, eIF4E silencing or blockade reduced the invasiveness and metastatic capability of breast cancer cells in a

manner associated with decreased activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 and MMP-9. Furthermore, eIF4E silencing
or ribavirin treatment suppressed features of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a process crucial for metastasis. Our
ﬁndings offer a preclinical rationale to explore broadening the
clinical evaluation of ribavirin, currently being tested in
patients with eIF4E-overexpressing leukemia, as a strategy to
treat solid tumors such as metastatic breast cancer. Cancer Res;

Introduction

in fact been shown to reduce breast cancer cell migration and
invasion (13). Moreover, metastasis is reduced when eIF4E cannot be phosphorylated (14).
The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a fundamental cellular process that is vital for metastasis. During EMT,
activation of transcription factors leads to altered expression of
cell surface proteins, production of extracellular matrix (ECM)
degrading enzymes, including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2, -3, and -9 (15–17), culminating in the formation of a migratory
and invasive cell (18). The transcriptional events involved in EMT
are well characterized, but the role of posttranscriptional regulation is not well deﬁned. One important regulator of EMT is the
cytokine TGFb (19–21). We recently described a novel model
wherein EMT induced by TGFb requires translational activation
via the noncanonical TGFb signaling branch acting through eIF4E
phosphorylation (14).
The only drug to date that has been shown to exhibit antitumor
activity linked to inhibition of eIF4E in patients is the antiviral
drug ribavirin (22). Ribavirin has been shown to mechanistically
inhibit eIF4E by competing with the 7-methylguanosine mRNA
cap (23, 24) and has antitumor activity in tumor cells with
elevated levels of eIF4E (3, 23, 25). In a proof-of-principle clinical
trial, ribavirin triggered dramatic clinical improvements in
patients with poor prognosis, eIF4E-overexpressing acute myelogenous leukemia (AML; ref. 22). Strikingly, clinical response
correlated with eIF4E inhibition, as shown by relocalization of
eIF4E and reduced protein levels of eIF4E targets (22). We have
previously demonstrated that ribavirin suppresses proliferation
and clonogenic potential of breast cancer cells in vitro in an eIF4Edependent manner (3). To extend these results, we assessed the
effects of ribavirin in vivo and found a remarkable inhibition of
primary tumor growth. In addition, we show that inhibiting
eIF4E, via siRNA-mediated downregulation or using ribavirin,
can suppress the expression of mesenchymal proteins and MMPs,
speciﬁcally MMP-3 and -9, and reduce invasion of both

Despite major advances in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, as well as the understanding of breast cancer biology, this
disease remains a signiﬁcant clinical challenge. Metastasis is the
main cause of breast cancer fatality, so understanding and targeting metastatic disease is critical for better therapeutic success. The
eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is an oncogene,
which is frequently overexpressed in cancer, including at least
50% of breast cancers (1–3). Overexpression and activity of eIF4E
is associated with tumor formation, metastatic disease, and
increased tumor invasion in mice (4–6). eIF4E function is essential for cap-dependent translation of speciﬁc mRNAs, including
many critical to cell division, cell survival, and angiogenesis (2, 7).
Importantly, cancer cells that overexpress eIF4E may develop an
oncogene addiction to eIF4E, rendering these cells vulnerable to
eIF4E inhibition, whereas normal cells are relatively insensitive
(8–10). We have reported that eIF4E is overexpressed in primary
breast tumors and in metastases (3), and studies have indicated
that high levels of eIF4E in the primary tumor correlate with
clinical progression (11, 12). This suggests that eIF4E could
promote a metastatic phenotype, and knockdown of eIF4E has

Ribavirin, eIF4E, and Breast Cancer Metastasis

mesenchymal cancer cells and normal mammary epithelial cells
induced to undergo EMT. Ultimately, we show that ribavirin can
reduce metastasis in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Cells and reagents
Mammary epithelial NMuMG cells were cultured in DMEM with
10% FBS, 10 mg/mL insulin (Sigma), and antibiotics. MT2186
cells, derived from a tumor that developed in a MMTV-PyMT
transgenic mouse (26), were obtained from Dr. Josie Ursini-Siegel
(Lady Davis Institute, Montreal, QC, Canada) and cultured in
DMEM with 5 % FBS, mammary epithelial growth supplement
(MEGS; Wisent) and antibiotics. 66cl4 cells (27) were obtained
from Dr. Ursini-Siegel and cultured in RPMI-1640 with 10 % FBS
and antibiotics. Human breast cancer cells were obtained from the
ATCC and maintained in DMEM (MDA-MB-231) or RPMI-1640
(BT474) with 10 % FBS and antibiotics. Culture media, FBS, and
antibiotics were purchased from Wisent. Lyophilized ribavirin
(Kemprotec Ltd.) was dissolved in H2O and sterile-ﬁltered before
use. Aliquots were kept at 80 C and thawed only once. TGFb1
was purchased from PeproTech.
Animal models
Female, 4 to 6 weeks old, FVB/NCrl, Balb/cAnNCrl and Crl:NUFoxn1nu mice were purchased from Charles River laboratories. All
animal care and experiments were carried out according to rules
and regulations established by the Canadian Council of Animal
Care and protocols were approved by the University Animal Care
Committee. A total of 5  105 MT2186 or 66cl4 cells were injected
into the mammary fat pad of FVB or Balb/c mice, respectively. A
total of 5  106 BT474 cells were resuspended in a mix of Matrigel
(BD) and PBS (1:3 ratio) before injection into the mammary fat
pad of nude mice, who had estradiol pellets (0.72 mg, 60-day
release) implanted subcutaneously 1 week before tumor cell
injection. Tumors were allowed to form and mice with palpable
tumors were randomized into groups receiving vehicle (H2O) or
3-mg ribavirin/mouse/d, administered orally by gavage 5 d/wk. At
endpoint, tumors were divided into three parts that were snap
frozen for protein and RNA isolation, ﬁxed in 10% formalin for
immunohistochemistry, and mechanically dissociated for assessment of clonogenic capacity. Lungs were formalin-ﬁxed for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining.
Ribavirin concentration in mice
Ribavirin plasma concentrations were assessed by mass spectrometry (Apredica) in samples collected during treatment (pool
of ﬁve samples from individual mice) or at the time of sacriﬁce
(1–2 hours after the last ribavirin dose).
Clonogenic assay
Cells isolated from each tumor were homogenized and passed
through a 25-G needle until resuspended as single cells and then
seeded at 500 cells per well in 6-well plates. After 14 days, cells
were ﬁxed in 10 % TCA and stained with sulforhodamine B.
Visible colonies were counted using a Gel Count colony counter
(Oxford Optronix).
Immunohistochemistry
Tumor sections were stained for Ki67 (abcam, 1:1,000) and
counterstained with 20 % Harris-modiﬁed hematoxylin (Fisher).

www.aacrjournals.org

Slides were scanned and Ki67-positive nuclei assessed using
Spectrum (Aperio Technologies). Batch analysis of 10 selected
areas of 5.8  102 mm2 (2.4  105 pixels) were run. Percent
positive nuclei per section were determined by addition of areas
until the average percent positive nuclei for one section did not
change. One tumor section per animal was analyzed, and at least
three areas of healthy tumor tissue were taken into consideration
for the percent positive nuclei result.
H&E staining and quantiﬁcation of metastasis
A total of 5  50 mm serial step sections were prepared and
stained for each mouse. Slides were scanned and metastases were
counted by hand. Percent burden and average metastasis size were
determined using Spectrum (Aperio Technologies). Percent burden per animal was calculated over the ﬁve sections as metastasis
area divided by total lung area. Average metastasis size was
calculated per animal as the average size of all metastasis areas
found within the ﬁve sections.
RNAi
Murine and human scrambled control siRNA and siRNAs
speciﬁc for eIF4E and MMP-3 were obtained from IDT. The
siRNAs were introduced into NMuMG, MT2186, and MCF10A
using RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's
protocol.
Western blotting
Cells were lysed in protein lysis buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl,
pH 8, 150 mmol/L NaCl, and 1 % Triton X-100) or RIPA buffer
(150 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 % NP-40, 1 %
sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 % SDS) supplemented with protease
and phosphatase inhibitors. Twenty to 50 mg of protein was used
to detect total eIF4E, E-cadherin, fribronectin, N-cadherin, and
vimentin (antibodies from BD Biosciences); phospho-eIF4E,
phospho-SMAD2, SMAD2/3, and Snail1 (Cell Signaling); as well
as cyclin D1 (Santa Cruz), MMP-3 (abcam), and ZO-1 (Invitrogen). b-Actin (Sigma) or Lamin A (Santa Cruz) were used to
conﬁrm equal protein loading. Protein expression was quantiﬁed
using ImageJ (NIH).
Immunoﬂuorescence
NMuMG cells were cultured on glass coverslips in 12-well
plates. After 24 hours, the cells were ﬁxed with ethanol:acetic
acid at 20 C, incubated with anti-ZO-1 (Invitrogen), then
incubated with Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG
(Molecular Probes). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst. The
mounted samples were scanned with a Leica DM LB2 microscope.
Differences between samples were quantiﬁed by selecting a
deﬁned area corresponding to edges between two cells and by
calculating the ImageJ parameter " RawIntDen," which is the sum
of the pixel values in the selected area.
Quantitative PCR
RNA was prepared using TRIzol (Invitrogen). cDNA was prepared from 1 mg of total RNA, using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit
(Bio-Rad). Snai1 mRNA expression was quantiﬁed using the
Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System with SYBR
Green–based detection using the following primers: 50 GCCGGAAGCCCAACTATAGC-30 and 50 -AGGGCTGCTGGAAGGTGAA-30 . 36B4 mRNA was quantiﬁed using the following

primers: 50 -GGCACCGAGGCAACAGTT-30 and 50 -TCATCCAGCAGGTGTTTGACA-30 . 18S was quantiﬁed using a predesigned
TaqMan assay (Applied Biosystems).
Wound-healing assay
Cells subjected to eIF4E knockdown or pretreteated with 20
mmol/L ribavirin for 24 to 48 hours were seeded in 6-well plates.
The next day, a wound was made in the conﬂuent cell layer using a
200 mL tip and the cells were gently washed with PBS to remove all
ﬂoating cells. Fresh complete media and drugs were added to the
cells (5 ng/mL TGFb, 20 mmol/L ribavirin). Pictures of the wounds
were taken at the time of the wounding and after 24 hours. The
area not ﬁlled by cells was quantiﬁed using ImageJ.
Matrigel invasion assay
Cells were pretreated with 20 mmol/L ribavirin for 24 to 48
hours and prestarved in 1 % FBS for 24 hours. Phenol red-free
Matrigel and 12-well plates with inserts with 8-mm porous membranes were purchased from BD Biosciences. For 66cl4 cells,
Matrigel was replaced with collagen I (Life technologies). Complete media in the bottom chamber acted as chemoattractant,
whereas the cells were resuspended in serum-free media  ribavirin (20 mmol/L) and seeded on top of the matrix. Eighteen hours
later, cells that had migrated through the matrix and the membrane were ﬁxed in 5% glutaraldehyde and stained with crystal
violet for visualization and counting.
Migration and invasion Transwell assay
The Transwell migration and invasion assays were performed as
previously described (28, 29). In brief, two independent
NMuMG-ErbB2 explants (NT118L and NT118R) were transfected
with control siRNA or eIF4E-speciﬁc siRNAs and incubated in the
presence or absence of TGFb for 24 hours before plating into
Boyden chambers. Cells that migrated or invaded to the underside
of the Transwell were ﬁxed and stained. Rates of cell migration and
invasion were assessed over the course of 24 hours in a RTCA DP
Analyzer (Roche Applied Science) and calculated according to
manufacturer's instructions using the xCELLigence RTCA software
(Roche Applied Science).
Gelatin zymography for MMP activity
Proteins from concentrated culture media, plasma, or protein
extracts were mixed 1:1 with loading dye (0.1 mol/L Tris-HCl,
pH 6.8, 4.5 % SDS, 22 % glycerol, bromophenol blue) and
incubated at 37 C for 15 minutes before separation in 7.5 %
acrylamide gels containing 0.1 % gelatin A (Fisher). Subsequently,
the gel was washed with 2.5 % Triton X-100 and incubated for
24 hours at 37 C in reaction solution (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH
7.4, 5 mmol/L CaCl2, 200 mmol/L NaCl) with gentle shaking. The
reaction was stopped by ﬁxing the gel for 5 minutes in 50 %
methanol þ 10 % acetic acid, followed by staining with 0.25 %
Coomassie blue. Bands were visualized using the chemigenius
2 bioimaging system (Syngene) and quantiﬁed using ImageJ.
Statistical analysis
All in vitro experiments were performed at least 3 times and
quantitative data are shown as the average of all replicates. Each in
vivo experiment was performed once with the number of animals
indicated in the ﬁgures. Statistical analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism. The type and stringency of the tests were

Results
Ribavirin blocks growth of mammary tumors in vivo
To assess the antitumor activity of ribavirin in vivo, we ﬁrst used
mammary tumor–derived MT2186 cells to generate tumors in
syngeneic FVB mice. MT2186 cells are growth inhibited by ribavirin in vitro, and as previously shown in human breast cancer
lines, this is due to cell-cycle arrest rather than cell death (3). When
tumors reached 500 mm3, mice were randomized to receive
vehicle (H2O) or ribavirin. Ribavirin 3 mg orally/mouse/d
resulted in plasma concentrations of 35 (10) mmol/L as measured in non–tumor-bearing FVB mice 1 to 2 hours posttreatment
(Supplementary Table S1). Importantly, similar concentrations
were measured in plasma from patients with AML treated with a
well-tolerated dose of ribavirin either alone (22) or in combination with low-dose Ara-C (unpublished data), conﬁrming that the
dose is clinically relevant. Animal weight was unaffected, indicating that the dose is well tolerated (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Importantly, we observed greatly reduced tumor growth in the
ribavirin-treated group (Fig. 1A), which translated to improved
survival in this group (Fig. 1B). Strikingly, 5 of 10 ribavirin-treated
MT2186 tumors regressed and 3 did not increase in size during the
ﬁrst 25 days of treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1B). However, all
tumors except one appeared to gain some degree of resistance
between days 25 and 40. At the time of sacriﬁce, a part of each
tumor was mechanically dissociated to obtain a single-cell suspension for analysis of clonogenic capacity. Cells from ribavirintreated tumors showed a greatly reduced ability to form colonies
ex vivo (Fig. 1C), despite the fact that the tumors were growing at
similar rates at the time of excision, as conﬁrmed by Ki67 staining
(Supplementary Fig. S1C). We examined the lungs of all mice at
endpoint, following H&E staining, but no metastases were
observed, despite the fact that these cells are invasive in vitro (see
below). To further examine the early response to ribavirin in vivo,
thus avoiding the emergence of drug resistance mechanisms, we
treated mice carrying MT2186 tumors with vehicle or ribavirin for
only 5 days. Remarkably, all tumors in the ribavirin-treated group
stopped growing or regressed during these 5 days (Fig. 1D), and
this was associated with a decrease in Ki67-positive nuclei compared with the control group (Fig. 1E). Tumor-derived protein
extracts from each of the 2 experiments were analyzed by western
blotting to assess the effect of ribavirin on eIF4E and its known
target cyclin D1. In tumors that had regressed following
5-day treatment with ribavirin, reduced levels of cyclin D1 were
observed; although due to lower tumor take in this experiment,
the numbers were too small to perform statistical analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1D and S1E). The total level of eIF4E was not
affected by ribavirin (Fig. 2A and C). However, phosphorylation
of eIF4E was signiﬁcantly reduced in tumors treated with ribavirin
for either 5 or 40 days (Fig. 2B and D; Supplementary Fig. S1E and
S1F). Moreover, the level of eIF4E phosphorylation showed a
positive correlation with tumor growth rate, as determined by the
Pearson r test (Fig. 2E and F), suggesting that the in vivo efﬁcacy of
ribavirin could be related to its ability to reduce phospho-eIF4E in
these tumors.
As a complement to these studies, we tested the in vivo activity of
ribavirin in a human xenograft model. Nude mice carrying BT474
tumors were treated as described for the FVB mice and, although

the experiment had to be terminated prematurely due to estradiol
toxicity (seen in both the control and ribavirin groups), a significant reduction in tumor growth was observed in response to
ribavirin (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Ribavirin reduces migration and invasion of mammary tumor
cells in vitro
It has been reported that knockdown of eIF4E can reduce breast
cancer cell migration and invasion (13). Ribavirin is the only
clinically used drug with documented activity against eIF4E (22),
and having established that ribavirin has potent in vivo activity
against mammary tumors, we wanted to test whether ribavirin
reduces the migratory and invasive properties of breast cancer
cells. Notably, ribavirin treatment of MT2186 cells signiﬁcantly
reduced cell motility (Fig. 3A) and invasion through Matrigel (Fig.
3B). Moreover, it reduced the invasive capacity of the human
triple-negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 3C) and
murine metastatic 66cl4 cells (27) (Fig. 3D). Importantly, suppression of cell migration and invasion was not due to reduced
overall cell number, as equal numbers of cells were re-seeded into
the wells after the pretreatment period, and migration or invasion
was assessed within 24 hours. We further assessed whether reducing or inhibiting eIF4E affects other characteristics of invasive
cells, such as the expression and activity of MMPs. First, MMP-2/9
activity was assessed in conditioned media from MT2186 cells.

www.aacrjournals.org

MMP-9, a reported eIF4E target (30), was conﬁrmed to be downregulated by either eIF4E knockdown or ribavirin treatment,
whereas MMP-2 was not reduced (Supplementary Fig. S3). We
recently reported that translation of MMP-3 is dependent on
phosphorylated eIF4E (14). Consistent with this, we observed
a considerable reduction in MMP-3 protein in MT2186 and 66cl4
cells transfected with siRNA targeting eIF4E or pretreated with
ribavirin (Fig. 3E and F). Knockdown of MMP-3 in MT2186 cells
resulted in a modest suppression of Matrigel invasion (Fig. 3G),
suggesting that the reduced level of MMP-3 following ribavirin
treatment may account for part of the anti-invasive effect.
Knockdown or functional inhibition of eIF4E suppresses
TGFb-induced EMT
TGFb is known to stimulate breast cancer cell invasiveness via
upregulation of MMP activity, in concert with EMT. Thus, we
asked whether inhibiting eIF4E, chemically or genetically, could
block characteristics of TGFb-induced cell invasiveness. We used
NMuMG mammary epithelial cells, a well-deﬁned model that
undergoes EMT and MMP production in response to TGFb (31,
32). Following eIF4E knockdown, the cells were exposed to TGFb,
and epithelial and mesenchymal markers were assessed by Western blotting. As expected, TGFb reduced expression of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and ZO-1 and increased the mesenchymal
markers N-cadherin, ﬁbronectin, and vimentin. Knockdown of

eIF4E attenuated these changes (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S4A).
Similar results were obtained in human, normal mammary epithelial MCF10A cells (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Importantly,
knockdown of eIF4E did not reduce the induction of SMAD2
phosphorylation by TGFb, indicating that the negative effect on
EMT is independent of suppression of the canonical TGFb signaling pathway (Fig. 4A). Immunoﬂuorescent staining for ZO-1,
which is a component of the intercellular epithelial cell junctions,
showed that TGFb stimulation leads to a loosening of the cell
junctions, and this is prevented by siRNA targeting eIF4E (Supplementary Fig. S5). We detected robust induction of MMP-9
activity in TGFb-treated NMuMG cells, and this was reduced by
knockdown of eIF4E (Fig. 4B). To further assess the effects of eIF4E
knockdown on the biologic outcome of EMT in these cells, we also
performed a wound-healing assay to evaluate motility. TGFb

treatment signiﬁcantly increased the ability of the cells to migrate

eIF4E knockdown would affect TGFb stimulated migration and
invasion in activated ErbB2-transformed NMuMG cell lines,
NT11L, and NT11R (29, 28). Knockdown of eIF4E prevented
TGFb induced cell migration and invasion in NT11L and NT11R,
as determined in Transwell assays (Fig. 4D and E). We then tested
whether ribavirin treatment could recapitulate some of the effects
of eIF4E knockdown on TGFb induced EMT. Speciﬁcally,
NMuMG cells were pretreated with 20 mmol/L ribavirin for 24
hours before the addition of TGFb, and changes to the expression
of mesenchymal markers was determined. Indeed, pretreatment
with ribavirin suppressed the induction of both N-cadherin and
ﬁbronectin, and similar to eIF4E knockdown, did not reduce the

induction of SMAD2 phosphorylation by TGFb (Fig. 4F). MMP
activity was assessed, and ribavirin pretreatment reduced induction of MMP-9 by TGFb (Fig. 4G).
A master regulator of EMT and metastasis, Snail, is controlled
by eIF4E phosphorylation (14). This prompted us to look at the
expression of Snail in both eIF4E siRNA-transfected and ribavirin-treated cells. Induction of Snail has been reported to be
sufﬁcient to induce EMT in mammary epithelial cells (34). We
ﬁrst showed that induction of Snail1 protein by TGFb was
suppressed in NMuMG and MCF10A cells transfected with
siRNA targeting eIF4E or pretreated with ribavirin (Fig. 5A and
B; Supplementary Fig. S4). The reduction was conﬁrmed to
occur at the posttranscriptional stage, as Snai1 mRNA was
unaffected (Fig. 5C). Moreover, we observed less Snail1 protein
in MDA-MB-231, MT2186, and 66cl4 breast cancer cells treated
with ribavirin (Fig. 5D), whereas Snai1 mRNA was not reduced
(Fig. 5E). We found that the decrease in Snail1 protein was
accompanied by an increase in ZO-1 and decreased ﬁbronectin
and vimentin in MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (Supplementary Fig. S6). However,
we did not observe a change in cell morphology (not shown).
In summary, reduced eIF4E activity represses the invasive
characteristics of both TGFb-treated mammary epithelial cells
and mesenchymal-like breast cancer cell lines, and this may at

least in part be explained by reduced induction of the critical
regulator of EMT and invasiveness, Snail.

Ribavirin reduces pulmonary metastases
To extend our analysis of the anti-invasive activity of ribavirin
to an in vivo model, we used 66cl4 cells, which form tumors in
syngeneic Balb/c mice that are known to metastasize to the lungs
(27). Starting on day 11 post-tumor cell injection, the mice were
treated orally with H2O or ribavirin as described above, which
resulted in plasma concentrations similar to those measured in
the FVB mice [23 (5) mmol/L, see Supplementary Table S1]. A
modest delay in tumor growth was evident in the ribavirin-treated
mice (Fig. 6A). On day 27, all mice were sacriﬁced and tumors and
lungs were preserved for analysis. Importantly, the ribavirintreated mice had signiﬁcantly reduced tumor burden in the lungs
(Fig. 6B). The heavy tumor burden in the lungs of several mice
made it hard to distinguish individual metastases, but there was a
clear trend toward reduced number of metastases as well as
smaller average metastasis size in the ribavirin group (Fig. 6C
and D), accounting for the decreased metastatic burden. There was
no correlation between metastatic burden and either primary
tumor size or tumor growth rate, as determined by Pearson r
correlation (not shown). Consistent with the MT2186 model,

ribavirin did not alter the level of eIF4E protein in the tumors, as
determined by Western blotting but reduced the level of eIF4E
phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S7A and S7C). eIF4E phosphorylation showed a signiﬁcant correlation with tumor growth
(percent change in tumor size) over the course of the experiment
(Supplementary Fig. S7B).
Our in vitro data showed that ribavirin reduced the levels of
MMP-3 and -9, so we wanted to assess if this also occurred in
vivo. MMP activity has been associated with invasiveness in
breast cancer models, including 66cl4 cells (35). We collected
plasma from 66cl4 tumor–bearing mice at different time points
after tumor cell injection to analyze circulating MMP activity
over the course of the experiment. Gelatin zymography was
used to assess the levels of MMP-2 and -9, and we found a
striking, selective increase in MMP-9 activity in the plasma of
tumor-bearing mice over time (Fig. 7A). This increase was
suppressed in the ribavirin-treated mice (Fig. 7A and B). More-

over, we assessed MMP-9 levels in tumor lysates (collected on
day 27) and found that ribavirin-treated tumors contained
signiﬁcantly less MMP-9 per total protein than tumors from
the control group (Fig. 7C; Supplementary Fig. S8A). MMP-3
levels were also assessed in the plasma and in tumor lysates
(both collected on day 27) and the pro-form as well as the
processed, active forms were signiﬁcantly reduced in the ribavirin-treated tumors (Fig. 7D and E; Supplementary Fig. S8B
and S8C). Of note, MMP-9 mRNA levels did not differ significantly between the 2 groups, whereas MMP-3 mRNA was
reduced in the ribavirin-treated tumors, indicating some regulation at the transcript level (Supplementary Fig. S8D and S8E).
Finally, to determine whether MMP levels, quantiﬁed by densitometry, correlate with lung metastasis in this experiment, we
used the Pearson r one-tailed correlation test. Notably, positive
correlations were observed between percent metastatic
burden and both plasma MMP-9 (r ¼ 0.39, P ¼ 0.04) and

tumor MMP-9 (r ¼ 0.44, P ¼ 0.03). In addition, there was a
weaker correlation between active MMP-3 in the tumor and
metastatic burden (r ¼ 0.37, P ¼ 0.05). We noted that one
mouse with high levels of MMP-3 and -9 had very few metastases, which strongly reduced the statistical signiﬁcance. This
was possibly due to a somewhat delayed tumor onset in this
mouse. Overall, our results suggest that the activity of MMP-3
and -9 in the tumor is important for its metastatic potential,
and thus it is plausible that the ability of ribavirin to reduce the
expression and secretion of these MMPs is involved in its antimetastatic activity. Moreover, the levels of both MMP-3 and -9
in the tumor correlated with the level of phospho-eIF4E (Fig. 7F
and G), again suggesting that suppression of eIF4E phosphorylation by ribavirin is functionally important.

Discussion
Metastatic breast cancer is an important clinical challenge.
Our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms
that regulate metastatic spread remains limited, and improved
knowledge will certainly bring new treatment options. We
hypothesized that modulation of eIF4E, a translation factor
that is frequently overexpressed in breast cancer and regulates
the expression of many proteins with important functions in
metastatic cancer (2), might affect invasiveness in part by
regulating EMT. In fact, we recently found that eIF4E phosphorylation modulates EMT and metastasis via translational
control of Snail and MMP-3 (14). We thus postulated that

in both cells (3, 23, 25, 36) and in patients (22), would show
antimetastatic activity in breast cancer models in vitro and in
vivo. We showed that reducing eIF4E activity, using siRNA or
ribavirin, could suppress migration and invasion in mammary
tumor–derived cells in vitro, and this was associated with
reduced levels of MMP-3 and -9 (Fig. 3; Supplementary Fig.
S3). MMP-3 is known to promote mammary tumor development and metastasis, through its ability to alter the stromal
compartment and to directly induce EMT (16, 17, 37, 38), and
several studies have shown that MMP-9 can stimulate migration and invasion (35, 39). From these data, we concluded that
suppression of MMP-3 and -9 may be partly responsible for
reducing the invasive behavior of cells following ribavirin
treatment, but postulated that modulation of additional factors
may also play a role. Indeed, we established that either downregulation of eIF4E or ribavirin pretreatment suppressed TGFbinduced EMT, correlating with reduced induction of MMP-9 as
well as reduced motility, migration, and invasion (Fig. 4).
Moreover, we found that induction of Snail was reduced,
providing a possible mechanism for the blunting of pro-invasive activity of TGFb (Fig. 5). Of note, the ability of TGFb to
activate SMAD transcriptional pathways was not altered, suggesting that eIF4E-mediated translation facilitates TGFb-mediated EMT. We therefore conclude that the mechanism by which
ribavirin exerts anti-invasive effects in these tumor cells
involves reducing the eIF4E-dependent translation of several
mRNAs encoding important regulators as well as effectors of
EMT, including MMP-9 (30) Snail, and MMP-3 (14). These
proteins could thus be direct ribavirin targets contributing to its

Ribavirin reduces lung metastasis. 66cl4 cells were injected into the
mammary fat pad of syngeneic Balb/c mice and treatment began on
day 11 postsurgery, once tumors were palpable. A, tumor growth was
monitored twice a week. B, metastatic lung burden was calculated as
percentage of tumor area/total lung area for each mouse. C, number of
metastases counted over 5  50 mm step sections for each mouse. D, average
size of all metastases counted for each mouse. Two-way ANOVA was

anti-invasive effect. In addition, a wealth of experimental data
link EMT to the generation of cancer stem cells (CSC), and this
study raises the possibility that eIF4E is implicated in the
generation or maintenance of such cells. We note that ribavirin-treated tumors showed signiﬁcantly reduced clonogenic
capacity ex vivo (Fig. 1C), which could be indicative of less
CSCs within the tumor. Our preliminary data also suggest that
eIF4E inhibition reduces the formation of mammospheres,
another feature of CSCs. Future studies are clearly needed to
deﬁne whether eIF4E indeed promotes the development of
CSCs, which may spearhead the development of therapeutic
strategies designed to interfere with eIF4E signaling and switch
off EMT programs.
In vivo, we used the highly aggressive 66cl4 model to assess
the affect of ribavirin on metastasis. Despite only a modest
inhibition of tumor growth by ribavirin in this model, a
reduction in lung metastases was evident (Fig. 6). The difference in average metastatic burden was quite striking; 18%
versus 4% of total lung area. We evaluated both the number
of metastases per lung and the average metastasis size, and
although there was a high degree of variability, especially in

1110 Cancer Res; 75(6) March 15, 2015

number of metastasis per lung, both values were reduced in the
ribavirin group. Because ribavirin signiﬁcantly reduces the
production by the tumor of two important matrix remodeling
enzymes, MMP-3 and -9, we propose that both the tumor cells
and, perhaps indirectly, the surrounding stroma are altered by
ribavirin to suppress and delay metastatic spread. Future experiments to determine the time course of lung colonization and to
proﬁle changes to the tumor microenvironment, both in the
mammary gland and in the lung, will help elucidate the
contribution of ribavirin induced changes in the different
compartments. It is important to note that the level of
MMP-9 produced by the tumor, and to a lesser extent MMP3, showed a correlation with metastatic burden, suggesting in
fact that suppression of these enzymes by ribavirin are important for its antimetastatic activity. This is consistent with published data obtained from the genetic knockout of MMP-9 in
PyMT transgenic mice, which resulted in a dramatic reduction
in lung metastasis (40). Of note, it has also been reported that
MMP-9–null mice display improved response to doxorubicin
due to increased vascular leakage (41), stressing the possibility
that suppression of MMPs by ribavirin may not only reduce
metastasis but also enhance response of the primary tumor to
chemotherapy.
Intriguingly, we found that ribavirin consistently reduces
eIF4E phosphorylation in all in vivo tumor models of breast
cancer, and the level of phospho-eIF4E at end point correlates
with tumor growth rate (Fig. 2). We ﬁnd this particularly
interesting, as phosphorylation of eIF4E has been shown to
be essential for its tumorigenic function (42, 43). In addition,
the level of eIF4E phosphorylation in the 66cl4 tumors correlated signiﬁcantly with levels of both MMP-3 and -9, further
supporting the notion that suppression of this posttranslational modiﬁcation is important for the in vivo activity of ribavirin.
It has previously been shown that inhibition of the eIF4E kinase
Mnk can reduce lung metastasis in a colon cancer model (44). A
recent article also reported that concomitant treatment with an
Mnk inhibitor and the mTORC1 inhibitor RAD001 is required
for efﬁcient inhibition of protein synthesis and proliferation in
a glioma model, further supporting a crucial role for eIF4E
phosphorylation and its inhibition in cancer therapy (45). We
have also recently reported that MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice
deﬁcient for phosphorylated eIF4E display reduced metastasis,
and this is associated with reduced mRNA translation of MMP3 and Snail (14). The mechanism by which ribavirin reduces
eIF4E phosphorylation in vivo is not clear; however, we did not
observe a decrease in either phosphorylation or total level of
Mnk1 (not shown).
Because ribavirin is a widely available, generic drug with
limited toxicity, its potential use as a breast cancer therapeutic
is of great interest. In this study, we have conﬁrmed its activity
against solid tumors in vivo, using 3 different mammary tumor
models, including the metastatic 66cl4, where antimetastatic
activity was observed despite only a minor effect on the primary
tumor growth. An ongoing phase I/II trial of ribavirin monotherapy in patients with metastatic cancers expressing high levels
of eIF4E (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01309490) will deﬁne the maximum tolerated dose and ultimately assess molecular response in
biopsies collected from accessible metastatic sites after 15 days of
treatment. We anticipate that this will further support the future
inclusion of ribavirin, or other inhibitors of eIF4E function, in
breast cancer therapy.
