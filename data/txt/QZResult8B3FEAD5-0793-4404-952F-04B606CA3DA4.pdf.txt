Abstract
2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2), a physiologic metabolite of 17Bestradiol (estrogen), has emerged as a promising cancer
therapy because of its potent growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects on both endothelial and tumor cells. 2ME2 also
suppresses osteoclast differentiation and induces apoptosis of
mature osteoclasts, and has been shown to effectively repress
bone loss in an animal model of postmenopausal osteoporosis.
Given these observations, we have examined whether 2ME2
could effectively target metastasis to bone, osteolytic tumors,
and soft tissue tumors. A 4T1 murine metastatic breast cancer
cell line was generated that stably expressed Far Red
fluorescence protein (4T1/Red) to visualize tumor development and metastasis to bone. In an intervention study, 4T1/
Red cells were injected into bone marrow of the left femur and
the mammary pad. In the latter study, 2ME2 (10, 25, and 50
mg/kg/d) treatment began on the same day as surgery and
was continued for the 16-day duration of study. Tumor cell
growth and metastasis to bone were monitored and bone
volume was determined by micro-computed tomography.
2ME2 inhibited tumor growth in soft tissue, metastasis to
bone, osteolysis, and tumor growth in bone, with maximum
effects at 50 mg/kg/d. Furthermore, tumor-induced osteolysis
was significantly reduced in mice receiving 2ME2. In vitro,
2ME2 repressed osteoclast number by inducing apoptosis of
osteoclast precursors as well as mature osteoclasts. Our data
support the conclusion that 2ME2 could be an important new
therapy in the arsenal to fight metastatic breast cancer.

Introduction
Eighty percent of breast cancer patients develop bone metastasis
as the disease advances. Bone marrow is a primary site of
metastasis, most likely due to its extensive blood supply, available
growth factors, and other aspects of the microenvironment. Once
tumors lodge in bone, progressive tumor growth leads to
osteoclast-mediated bone loss (osteolysis), which causes debilitating pain and pathologic fracture (1). Bisphosphonates antagonize
metastatic tumor progression and decrease the number of boneresorbing osteoclasts at sites of osteolysis (2). However, bisphosphonate therapy does not impede growth of tumors in soft tissues
and, as a consequence, tumors at these sites continue to grow and
metastasize (3). Therapies that target both osteolysis and tumor

growth would be an improvement in the battle against breast
cancer. 2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2), a physiologic metabolite of
17h-estradiol that does not bind to the estrogen receptor (ER), has
recently emerged as a promising anticancer agent because of its
potent growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects on both
endothelial and tumor cells. In vivo studies of several tumor types,
including sarcoma, lung, and breast cancer cells, have documented
potent inhibitory effects on tumor cells and angiogenesis while
showing no clinical signs of toxicity (4–10). Recently, in a rat
orthotopic brain tumor model, 2ME2 significantly inhibited growth
of malignant glicosarcoma (11). Investigation of the effect of 2ME2
on bone metabolism in normal and ovariectomized rats revealed
that 2ME2 suppressed bone loss in the ovariectomized rats in the
absence of ER binding without causing uterotrophic effects (12, 13).
In further studies, it was documented that 2ME2 repressed
osteoclast differentiation while inducing mature osteoclast apoptosis (14). These combined data raise the strong possibility that
2ME2 treatment may decrease tumor burden while blocking tumorinduced osteolysis in vivo. In this report, we document that 2ME2
effectively represses tumor progression in a model that examines
both tumor metastasis and tumor growth. Furthermore, we also
found that 2ME2 induces osteoclast precursor apoptosis, revealing
a mechanism by which 2ME2 reduces tumor-induced osteolysis.

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture, Reagents, and Animals
Cell lines were cultured in standard growth medium [a-MEM, 10% bovine
serum albumin (BSA), 500 Ag/mL G418]. 2ME2 was purchased from
Calbiochem and dissolved in 95% ethanol. Recombinant receptor activator of
nuclear factor-nB ligand (RANKL) was expressed in E. coli and purified using
glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Sepharose columns. Macrophage colonystimulating factor (M-CSF) was purchased from R&D Systems. a-MEM,
DMEM, fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, streptomycin, and trypsin-EDTA,
used for cell culture, were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Reagents for
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, bisbenzimide for staining
nuclei, and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Generation of Far Red–Fluorescing 4T1 Cells
4T1 cells were grown in a-MEM supplemented with 10% BSA, 1%
and 1% penicillin and streptomycin in 5% CO2 and 95% air at
37jC. The cells were passaged at 80% to 90% confluence using a solution of
0.125% trypsin and 2 mmol/L EDTA in Ca2+/Mg2+–free DMEM. The pIRES2DsRed2 vector (BD Biosciences/Clonetech) coding for Far Red protein was
transfected stably into 4T1 cells by Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to
the vendor’s instruction. The stable transformants were selected in medium
containing 500 Ag/mL geneticin (Invitrogen) and cloned by limiting
dilution. The stable clones expressing the Far Red protein were
characterized under fluorescence microscopy.

2ME2 Suppresses Osteolytic Tumor Metastasis

Figure 1. Fluorescence imaging of in vivo
bone metastasis following administration of
4T1/Red cells to BALB/c mice. To determine
the origins of the metastasis, 103 tumor cells
were injected into the bone marrow or the
mammary pad of mice. Bottom, close-up of
the framed images of femur and tibia from
noninjected and 4T1/Red-injected mice.
L, left bone; R, right bone. The mammary
pad–injected tumor metastasized to bones
and the osteolytic bone–injected tumor cells
metastasized to the noninjected contralateral
limb.

Animals were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (0.65 mL ketamine
+ 0.25 mL xylazine + 9.1 mL sterile saline) before surgery for injection of
tumor cells. The dose was determined on the basis of the mouse weight
(17 AL/g of body weight).
Experiment 1. Mice (6–7 weeks old) were randomized into two groups
(n = 3 per group) and inoculated with 103 4T1 cells expressing fluorescent
Far Red protein (4T1/Red) into the left thoracic mammary pad (group 1) or
the left femur marrow cavity (group 2). Sixteen days after implantation of
tumor cells, mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide narcosis and femurs
and tibias were excised and examined using a Kodak IS4000 imaging
system.
Experiment 2. Mice (6–7 weeks old) were randomized into four
treatment groups (n = 4 per group). Four of the groups were inoculated with
103 4T1/Red cells into the mammary pad and left femur. The other four
groups were operated but did not receive tumor cells. 2ME2 treatment
began on the same day as surgery and was administered to the tumorinoculated and sham-operated groups by s.c. injection at 0 (ethanol vehicle),
10, 25, and 50 mg/kg 2ME2 doses daily. Mice were euthanized by carbon
dioxide narcosis on day 16 and mammary pads, femurs, and tibias removed
and fixed in 75% ethanol. Quantification of tumor cell burden in mammary
pad and bone was done by calculating the fluorescence index density at
565 nm.

Micro-Computed Tomography
A micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) was used for nondestructive
three-dimensional evaluation of bone volume. Femora were scanned using
a Scanco ACT40 scanner (Scanco Medical AG) at a voxel size of 12 
12  12 Am and a threshold of 265 (gray scale, 0–1,000). Bone volume (mm3)
was determined in 100 slices (1.2 mm) at a distance of 0.6 to 1.8 mm
proximal to the highest point of the growth plate of the femur.

Bone Histology
Tumor-injected vehicle (ethanol)- and 2ME2-treated bones were processed for glycol-methacrylate (JB4, Polysciences) embedding following
fixation and dehydration in alcohols. Two-micrometer sections were stained
for TRAP to localize osteoclasts and their immediate precursors as
previously described (15).

In vitro Osteoclastogenesis Assay
Freshly isolated bone marrow cells from BALB/c mice (6–7 weeks old)
were cultured in a-MEM plus 10% FBS containing M-CSF (50 ng/mL) for
24 h. Nonadherent cells were collected, seeded at an initial density of
4.5  105 per well in 24-well plates, and cultured in the presence of
recombinant RANKL (100 ng/mL) and M-CSF (30 ng/mL). Media were
changed on day 3. To evaluate the effects of 2ME2 on osteoclast precursor
apoptosis, day 3 adherent precursors were treated with 2 Amol/L 2ME2 or

vehicle for 12 and 24 h and the cells were fixed in 1% buffered neutral
paraformaldehyde. Hoechst and TRAP staining was carried out as
previously described (16). Cells with condensed chromatin were considered
apoptotic. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined as the number
of apoptotic mononuclear or multinucleated (>3 nucleated cells) cells
versus the total number of mononuclear or multinucleated cells with the
use of a fluorescence microscope.

Statistics
The results are calculated as mean F SD. Statistical significance was
determined by Student’s t test.

Results
In experiment 1, we injected buffer (sham) or 103 4T1/Red cells
into the left femur marrow cavity or the mammary fat pad of
BALB/c mice and monitored tumor growth and metastasis. Sixteen
days after tumor implanting, the soft tissue tumor site and the left
and right femurs and tibias were excised and examined by
bioluminescence for tumor metastasis (Fig. 1). Mammary pad–
injected tumor growth consistently metastasized to bones with a

lower incidence of metastasis to soft tissues such as lung (data not
shown). In addition to osteolytic tumor growth in the injected left
limb from mice receiving tumor cells into the bone, metastases
were also observed in the noninjected contralateral limb (Fig. 1,
right limb). Thus, tumor injection into either site (mammary pad or
bone) resulted in metastasis to bone.
In experiment 2, a dose response study of 2ME2 effect on
metastasis originating from simultaneous soft tumor and bone
marrow injections was carried out (Fig. 2A–C). There was a
significant inhibition of bone metastasis to the noninjected
contralateral limb in mice receiving 25 mg/kg/d 2ME2 (Fig. 2B)
whereas 50 mg/kg/d 2ME2 significantly inhibited tumor growth
in both the injected and noninjected femurs (Fig. 2A and C). In
the 50 mg/kg/d 2ME2 treatment, there is variation of tumor
suppression among injected bones (Fig. 2A). This could be the
biological variability in responding to 2ME2 treatment. However,
overall there is significant inhibition observed in the 50 mg/kg/d
2ME2 treatment group as compared with vehicle-treated group.
Examination of the mammary fat pad tumor injection site

limb in mice receiving 25 mg/kg/d 2ME2. C, fluorescence intensity analysis confirmed the inhibition of tumor growth by 2ME2 in injected limbs and in the contralateral
limbs. D, soft tissue tumor growth was significantly suppressed by 50 mg/kg/d 2ME2.

2ME2 Suppresses Osteolytic Tumor Metastasis

revealed a significant suppression by the highest 2ME2 dose,
suggesting that 2ME2 acts on primary tumor growth as well as
metastasis (Fig. 2D).
Micro-CT analysis of the bones was used to quantify the effect of
2ME2 on osteolysis (Fig. 3). Severe internal and external bone
erosion in tumor-implanted vehicle-treated mouse bones was
observed, indicating tumor expansion from medullary bone
marrow to the external cortical bone (Fig. 3A, left images).
Tumor-induced osteolysis was significantly reduced in the bones
from mice receiving 2ME2 (Fig. 3A, middle images). The bone
volume of the distal femur from mice injected with 4T1/Red tumor
cells was increased significantly in 50 mg/kg 2ME2–treated mice,
indicating that 2ME2 clearly suppressed 4T1-induced osteolysis in
tumor-injected mouse bones (Fig. 3B).
We have found that tumor cells secrete multiple cytokines and
growth factors that simulate osteoclasts (17). We have also shown
that 2ME2 induces apoptosis of mature (multinucleated) osteoclasts and suppresses osteoclast differentiation (14). To examine
2ME2 influences on osteoclasts and tumor cells in vivo, we
examined the bone from vehicle- and 2ME2-treated mice
histologically (Fig. 3C). In vehicle-treated bones implanted with
tumor cells, the bone surfaces adjacent to the marrow cavity had
many acid phosphatase–positive osteoclasts whereas bones from
50 mg/kg 2ME2–treated mice contained few, if any, osteoclasts (top
left and right, respectively). To determine the mechanism by which
2ME2 suppresses formation, mononucleated osteoclast precursors
were treated with 2ME2 during early differentiation (Fig. 4A).
RANKL- and M-CSF–induced osteoclastogenesis was suppressed
significantly when 2ME2 (2 Amol/L) was added to culture media at
the early stage of osteoclast differentiation (Fig. 4A). 2ME2
treatment reduced the number of multinucleated osteoclasts and
mononuclear TRAP-positive cells (Fig. 4B). 2ME2 resulted in
increased apoptosis of multinucleated osteoclasts and mononuclear TRAP-positive cells (Fig. 4C).

Breast cancer that metastasizes to bone leads to pathologic
bone erosion, causing debilitating pain, fracture, and hypercalcemia. As a means to mimic the patient condition, we have
examined therapeutic responses on bone tumor load in an
animal model where tumor cells are directly deposited into the
bone microenvironment (18). In our in vivo model, tumor cells
injected directly into bone marrow metastasized to distant
extremities. These data support the capability of tumor cells to
disseminate from the bone marrow microenvironment to other
bones or soft tissues. To our knowledge, this is the first report
showing bone to bone metastasis of breast cancer in a mouse
model and confirms that 4T1 breast cancer cells can metastasize
from secondary sites to distant extremities and organs. This may,
therefore, be an ideal model to study the mechanism of bone to
bone metastasis in breast cancer.
Targeting metastatic tumors at sites of metastasis would be of
great benefit for patients who have advanced cancer diseases.
Destroying tumors in bone and also slowing the development of
osteolytic lesions would be desirable therapies and would greatly
improve the prognosis of patients who have bone micrometastasis. Our results showed that 2ME2 inhibits growth of highly
metastatic ER-negative 4T1 cells in vivo. Studies also indicated
that 2ME2 represses growth and induces apoptosis of a variety of
cancer cell lines, including ER-positive and ER-negative breast

cancer cells (19). These data suggest that 2ME2 has no differential
effect on ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer cells, which
is not surprising given that 2ME2 does not bind to and activate
ERs.
A limited number of in vivo studies of 2ME2 have investigated
tumor development using sarcoma, lung, brain, and soft tissue
transplanted breast cancer cells (6, 9–11, 13). To date, no studies
have examined the effect of 2ME2 on tumor progression in bone. In
the present study, we showed that 2ME2 inhibits tumor-induced
osteolysis in vivo while blocking tumor metastasis. Frequently,
tumor-injected bones seemed to be shorter when viewed with the
digital images (Figs. 1 and 2, left limb of tumor-injected bones
without 2ME2 treatment). As can be seen with the micro-CT image
(Fig. 3A), this is due to the sever erosion of the bone when tumor
cells are not treated with 2ME2.
The published literature and our data support that the estrogen
metabolite 2ME2 may be a potential therapy targeting tumor-

induced osteolysis and tumor metastasis. However, clinical studies
indicated that p.o. delivery of 2ME2 as a primary tumor therapy
showed significant limitations due to its apparent poor bioavailability (4). In contrast, we have found that 2ME2 can be effectively
delivered by s.c. injection in much lower doses than p.o.
administration. Using this in vivo metastasis model, we have shown
for the first time that the physiologic metabolite 2ME2 has direct
inhibitory effects on primary tumor growth, metastasis to bones, and
tumor-driven osteolysis. 2ME2 represses osteoclast differentiation
when precursors are cocultured with stromal cells and treated with
vitamin D and dexamethasone (14). However, growth factors have
been shown to have opposing influences on osteoclast differentiation in coculture compared with direct effects when precursors are
cultured without stromal cells and provided with M-CSF and RANKL
(20). We therefore have used this latter model to determine the
influences of 2ME2 on osteoclast precursors. In this alternative
model of osteoclast formation, 2ME2 targeted osteoclast precursors

as well as mature osteoclasts by inducing apoptosis. Because of its
low toxicity and inhibitory actions on osteoclasts as well as breast
tumor cells, 2ME2 is an attractive candidate for controlling
metastasis to bone and bone disorders.
In conclusion, we have shown that 2ME2 inhibits tumor
metastasis and osteolysis in the bone microenvironment caused
by metastatic breast cancer cells. The in vivo and in vitro data
clearly indicated that 2ME2 has direct effects on reducing tumor
burden as well as inhibiting tumor-induced osteoclast-mediated
osteolysis. Therefore, the reduction of osteoclast number in 2ME2treated mice prevents the tumor-induced bone loss. Based on these
