ABSTRACT
Clinically applicable platforms revealing actionable genomic alterations may
improve the treatment efficacy of myeloma patients. In this pilot study, we used a
high depth targeted sequencing panel containing 83 anti-cancer drug target genes
to sequence genomic DNAs extracted from bone marrow aspirates of 23 patients
with myeloma and 12 patients with amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis. Mutation
analysis revealed NRAS as the most commonly mutated gene (30%, 7/23) in
myeloma patients followed by KRAS (26%, 6/23) and BRAF (22%, 5/23). However,
no significant mutations were found in the 12 patients with AL amyloidosis. Notably,
6 of the 23 myeloma patients showed multi-site and/or multi-gene mutations in
NRAS, KRAS, or BRAF, indicating compound aberrations in the Mitogen activated
protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Gene panel sequencing also revealed cytogenetic
abnormalities associated with prognosis in myeloma patients. In conclusion, our pilot
study suggests that targeted gene sequencing may have an important prognostic
value for myeloma patients for the identification of actionable genomic alterations
and cytogenetic aberrations.

INTRODUCTION

preceded by an asymptomatic expansion of clonal plasma
cells [8, 9]. Amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis is a rare
clonal plasma cell disorder characterized by deposition of
amyloid fibrils derived from immunoglobulin light chains
in various organs [10]. AL amyloidosis and multiple
myeloma are theoretically same disease entity at the
cellular level, and AL amyloidosis was reported to share
genetic susceptibility with multiple myeloma [11]. The
presence of small plasma cell clones in AL amyloidosis
implies that these clones could become larger, leading to
overt multiple myeloma over time [12]. Thus, patients
with myeloma may have heterogeneous subclones,
and the identification of genetic abnormalities with low
frequency in these subclones could be helpful for a better
understanding of each patient with myeloma. However, it

Since novel drugs such as proteasome inhibitors
and immunomodulatory agents were first introduced for
the treatment of multiple myeloma, survival outcomes
have significantly improved [1–3]. However, multiple
myeloma still remains an incurable disorder because
almost all patients relapse and become refractory to
salvage treatments [4, 5]. As treatment outcome may be
associated with cytogenetic abnormalities at diagnosis,
patients with multiple genetic alterations might show
worse prognosis than patients without them [6, 7]. Genetic
alterations may accumulate during the development of
myeloma from asymptomatic monoclonal gammopathy
of undetermined significance because myeloma cases are

Mutations in myeloma and AL amyloidosis

is difficult to detect low frequency genetic alterations in
small subclones by conventional molecular testing using
malignant plasma cells from bone marrow. Genomic
next generation sequencing (NGS) has allowed for a
thorough exploration of the genetic alterations possible in
myeloma [13, 14]. However, NGS is still not readily used
in clinical practice because it is both a high cost and timeconsuming process. Thus, the development of clinically
applicable platforms revealing genomic alterations could
help to improve a risk-adapted treatment strategy. Here,
we performed a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of a
targeted gene sequencing panel consisting of 83 genes in
myeloma and AL amyloidosis patients.

Patients were genotyped using high depth panel
sequencing with a mean depth of coverage, 846×
(Supplementary Table S1). Mutation analysis of all
myeloma patients including the six patients with AL
amyloidosis revealed NRAS as the most commonly
mutated gene (30%, 7/23), followed by KRAS (26%, 6/23)
and BRAF (22%, 5/23) (Figure 1B). One patient (patient #1,
Table 3) showed multiple mutations in NRAS, KRAS,
and BRAF, and two other patients (patients #2 and #23,
Table  3) showed BRAF mutations with either NRAS
or KRAS. Three patients showed multi-site mutations
in the KRAS or BRAF gene (patients #6, #7, and #10,
Table 3). However, no significant mutations were found
in the 12  patients with AL amyloidosis alone, although
mutations were found in myeloma with AL amyloidosis
(Figure 1B). Although some patients showed more than
30% allele frequency, the majority of mutations in the three
genes showed low variant allele fractions (around 5%).
Mutations in BRAF and KRAS were verified using droplet
digital PCR (ddPCR), and the values of allele frequency
from the 7 patients harboring low allele fraction (≤ 10%)
mutations were highly correlated with those of ddPCR
(r = 0.95) (Figure 2). Thus, the application of a targeted
gene sequencing panel in myeloma patients identified
mutations in mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)
pathway-related genes (KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF).
Interestingly, the low allele frequency mutations were
detected in separate sequence reads from those with high
allele frequency mutations (Supplementary Figure S1),
demonstrating the ongoing alteration of MAPK pathway
for the wild type tumor populations. These data suggest
that the high sensitivity of our panel sequencing platform
could allow for early detection of subclones with clinical
significance.

RESULTS
Characteristics of patients
A total of 35 patients was enrolled in this study;
the median age at diagnosis was 60 years (range: 31–85).
Patients were classified into one of three groups according
to the percentage of plasma cells and the presence of organ
amyloidosis and osteolytic lesions: myeloma (n = 17),
myeloma with AL amyloidosis (n = 6), and AL amyloidosis
(n = 12). Thus, 17 patients who were diagnosed with
myeloma had at least 10% malignant plasma cells in their
bone marrow in conjunction with increased M protein in
the serum and/or urine. With the exception of one patient,
all myeloma only patients also had at least one sign or
symptom related to myeloma such as renal dysfunction,
anemia, or osteolytic bone lesion (Table 1). In the remaining
18 patients, the presence of amyloid depositions in various
organs such as heart, kidney and gastrointestinal tract was
pathologically confirmed; thus, they were diagnosed with
AL amyloidosis. Six of these patients had ≥ 30% plasma
cells in their bone marrow aspirates or had osteolytic lesions
diagnosed as myeloma coupled with AL amyloidosis
(Table 2). The clinical and laboratory characteristics
of patients at diagnosis and their initial treatments and
transplantations are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. The
most commonly used treatment regimens were thalidomide,
dexamethasone with or without cyclophosphamide (n =
13), and bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (n = 9).
Bortezomib-containing treatment was used for patients
ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT),
whereas thalidomide-containing treatment was done for
patients eligible for ASCT. Thus, ASCT was done in 13
patients as a part of the induction treatment. At the time of
analysis, 26 patients were alive, while nine patients died
from myeloma (n = 4), AL amyloidosis (n = 2), or myeloma
with AL amyloidosis (n = 3). The overall survival was not
significantly different among the three groups (Figure 1A).
When patients with AL amyloidosis were grouped together
regardless of myeloma, the comparison of overall survival
was not different either (Figure 1A).

Copy number variations in myeloma and AL
amyloidosis
In addition to mutational analysis, gene panel
sequencing was used to detect chromosomal copy number
variations (CNV), which are often associated with prognosis
in myeloma patients. Three types of CNV were detected in
myeloma patients in a mutually exclusive manner, while
amyloidosis patients had scarcely any changes (Figure 3A).
The three CNVs in myeloma patients were amplification of
chromosome 1q, amplification of odd number chromosomes
(hyperdiploidy), and deletion of chromosome 13q. In
particular, the chromosome 13q deletion was frequently
detected in patients with the dual diagnosis of myeloma
and amyloidosis (5 out of 6). Notably, chromosome 1q
amplification and 13q deletion are associated with poor
prognosis in multiple myeloma [15, 16]. The CNV calls
made from gene panel sequencing showed a significant

patients with AL amyloidosis alone, although patients
with myeloma combined with AL amyloidosis did show
mutations in all three genes (Figure 1B). The frequency
of the mutations in the three genes identified in our
study was consistent with those presented in a recent
study of whole-exome sequencing in 463 patients with
myeloma enrolled in the National Cancer Research
Institute Myeloma XI trial, which reported a dominant
mutation in the RAS (43%) [17]. Mutations in RAS
gene family have been reported to show predominant
mutational activation of one member of the RAS gene
family. Solid tumors such as colorectal and pancreatic
cancers showed frequent KRAS mutations, whereas some
hematologic cancers such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia
predominately showed NRAS mutations [18]. Unlike
other malignancies, mutations of KRAS and NRAS were
found in approximately equal rates in myeloma [19, 20].
Similarly, the frequency of mutations was similar between
NRAS (30%, 7/23) and KRAS (26%, 6/23) in our study
(Figure 1B). BRAF mutations (22%, 5/23) were also
found in five myeloma patients including two patients
with both AL amyloidosis and myeloma (Figure 1B). The
BRAF mutation is known to be mutually exclusive with
KRAS and/or NRAS mutations in other cancers [21];
however, in our study, mutations in BRAF did not appear
to be exclusive to either the KRAS or NRAS mutation
because mutations in KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF were
all found in the same patient (patient #1, Table 3). Given
that each RAS family member can provide a similar

Association of treatment response and
NRAS/KRAS/BRAF mutation
Among the seven patients with NRAS mutation,
four patients (patients #1–4) were treated with bortezomibcontaining treatment; three of these patients did not respond
(Table 1). Thus, 75% (3/4) of patients showed disease
progression during bortezomib treatment, although the
sample size was small. Two patients with BRAF mutations
also failed to show response to bortezomib; however, these
patients (patients #1 and #2) both had NRAS mutations.
Although only two patients with KRAS mutations received
the bortezomib-containing treatment (patient #1, 8), neither
responded to it. (One patient showed disease progression
while the other maintained a stable disease state; Table 1).
There was no significant association between the presence
of the mutation and the response to other drugs such as
thalidomide (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we identified mutations in three
well-known oncogenes, KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF, in
multiple myeloma patients. No mutations were found in

oncogenic signal through the mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) pathway promoting cell proliferation,
the presence of these mutations could be expected to
result in a worse treatment outcome than the absence
of these mutations. Indeed, a previous study showed an
association of NRAS mutations with a lower response rate
to bortezomib and a shorter time to disease progression
in bortezomib-treated patients [22]. In our study,
patients with NRAS mutations showed poor response
to bortezomib-containing treatments. Furthermore, the
patient with mutation of three genes, KRAS, NRAS and
BRAF (patient #1, Table 3) was primarily refractory to
bortezomib, lenalidomide, and bendamustine-containing
treatments. None of the mutations in the MAPK pathwayrelated genes were detected by conventional molecular
tests at the time of initial diagnosis. Thus, a targeted
sequencing such as our cancer panel may be useful for
detecting low frequency genetic events, allowing for
a predicted treatment response. As our patients with
AL amyloidosis were mainly treated with thalidomide
or alkylating agents, the association of the absence of
the MAPK-pathway related gene mutations with the
response to bortezomib could not be evaluated in this
study (Table  2). However, our previous study with AL

amyloidosis patients showed that sixteen of nineteen
(84%) patients who were treated with bortezomib,
melphalan, and prednisolone had a hematologic response,
including seven complete responders [23]. These results
support the association of MAPK pathway gene mutations
with the response to bortezomib.
Our pilot study applied a targeted gene sequencing
panel consisting of 83 genes that were selected based
on the availability of corresponding targeting agents.
Thus, the genes used for the targeted sequencing could
be targeted by developed anti-cancer drugs. Furthermore,
gene panel sequencing provided large numbers of
mutations as well as chromosomal amplifications or
deletions with an important prognostic value compared
to the conventional cytogenetic and FISH methods. As
there are discrepancies between gene panel sequencing
and conventional cytogenetic/FISH methods, further
improvement is required for the use of next generation
sequencing for cytogenetic analysis.
Compared to myeloma and myeloma with AL
amyloidosis, the results of AL amyloidosis showed
no evidence of major mutations. Indeed, the clinical
features and treatment outcomes were mainly correlated
with the type and extent of organ involvement rather

than by the number of plasma cells in patients with AL
amyloidosis [24, 25]. By comparison, a previous study
with longitudinal whole genome sequencing of a highrisk myeloma patients demonstrated tumor heterogeneity
at diagnosis and identiﬁed potential mutations contributing
to myeloma development as well as transformation
from myeloma to overt extramedullary disease [26].
Accordingly, genetic alterations could accumulate during
the process of myeloma development and progression
contributing to genetic heterogeneity of myeloma. This
heterogeneity also might influence treatment outcomes
of myeloma because certain clones with a given genetic
mutations may be sensitive to one drug whereas a different
clone having with a different genetic mutations may not
respond to the drug, resulting in relapse or progression
after treatment. Thus, the initial screening of the genetic
mutation landscape for each myeloma patient at diagnosis
may provide important information for subsequent
treatment and follow-up of myeloma patients.
Nonetheless, our study has some limitations.
First, our gene panel mainly consisted of genes covering
targets of developed anti-cancer drugs. Given that the
majority of targeted agents currently available focus on
solid tumors, a substantial number of genes studied were
related to solid tumor phenotypes rather than to myeloma.
It is also possible that some patients had alterations in
non-target regions. Second, we could not demonstrate
an association of mutations in MAPK pathway-related
genes (KRAS, NRAS and BRAF) with survival outcomes
of our patients. Thus, further study with larger study
populations and longer follow-ups are required to confirm
the clinical utility of targeted sequencing. Recently,
Kortum et al. investigated 72 untreated myeloma patients
with deletion 17p using a myeloma-specific gene panel
for targeted sequencing of 47 genes. They found a higher
prevalence of TP53 mutation (28%) than previous studies
and suggested that this targeted sequencing could provide
a comprehensive insight into the mutational landscape of
high-risk myeloma [27].
In conclusion, we present results of our pilot
study with targeted genome sequencing for myeloma
and AL amyloidosis. We believe that targeted gene
panel sequencing will help to further improve myeloma
diagnosis as well as track clonal heterogeneity.
Furthermore, this diagnostic approach may provide
more precise prognosis and better guidance for treatment
decisions in myeloma patients.

presence of malignant plasma cells ≥ 10% of bone marrow
aspirates and increased monoclonal proteins in serum and/
or urine [28]. AL amyloidosis was diagnosed with the
presence of amyloid deposits in involved organs, which
was confirmed by Congo red staining and monoclonal
protein in serum and/or urine. After obtaining informed
consent from participating patients, we performed bone
marrow aspiration. Plasma cells were isolated by magnetic
separation using anti-CD138 microbeads and were stored
at −80°C. The extent of disease in myeloma patients was
determined using the International Staging System (ISS)
consisting of serum albumin and beta-2 microglobulin
[29]. All patients with myeloma received induction
treatment with curative intent. Induction treatment was
done with immunomodulatory agents or proteasome
inhibitors according to the physicians’ discretion. After
induction treatment, ASCT was done for eligible patients.
To diagnose AL amyloidosis, patients receiving ASCT
were < 65 years with adequate cardiac function. However,
patients ineligible for ASCT received only an alkylating
agent containing a chemotherapeutic agent such as
melphalan or dexamethasone. The hematologic response
to treatment was based on the revised uniform response
criteria by the International Myeloma Working Group
[30]. The survival and disease statuses were updated at the
time of analysis; thus, the last update was done in March,
2016. All aspects of the study were reviewed and approved
by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Samsung
Medical Center (No. 2012-08-059).

Targeted sequencing
Targeted sequencing was done using a customized
cancer panel. Genomic DNA was extracted from tissue
specimens using QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA, USA). Genomic DNA quality and quantity were
determined using a Nanodrop 8000 UV-Vis spectrometer
(Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA ), a Qubit 2.0
Fluorometer (Life Technologies Inc., Grand Island,
NY, USA), and a 2200 TapeStation Instrument (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Genomic DNA
(250 ng) from each tissue was sheared with Covaris
S220 (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA) and was used for the
construction of a library using probes and the SureSelect XT
reagent kit, HSQ (Agilent Technologies) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. As previously reported, this panel
is designed to enrich exons of 83 genes covering 366.2 kb
of the human genome [31]. After the enriched exome
libraries were multiplexed, the libraries were sequenced
using the HiSeq 2500 sequencing platform (Illumina, San
Diego, CA, USA). Briefly, a paired-end DNA sequencing
library was prepared through gDNA shearing, end-repair,
A-tailing, paired-end adaptor ligation, and amplification.
After hybridization of the library with bait sequences for
27 hr, the captured library was purified and amplified with
an index barcode tag, and the library’s quality and quantity

Sequence reads were mapped to the human genome
(hg19) using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) [32].
Duplicate read removal was done using Picard (v1.93) and
Samtools [33]. Local alignment was optimized using The
Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) [34]. Variant calling was
done only in targeted regions of the cancer panel. To detect
single nucleotide variants, we integrated results of three
kinds of variants caller [35–37], which increased sensitivity.
We used a Pindel to detect insertions and deletions [38].
Copy number variations were calculated for targeted regions
by dividing read-depth per exon by the estimated normal
reads per exon using an in-house reference. Gene fusions in
the target region were identified using an in-house algorithm.

Digital droplet PCR
Digital droplet PCR was performed on a QX200
ddPCR™ System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA)
platform. Briefly, ddPCR™ reaction mixes were prepared
with template gDNAs, ddPCR™ Supermix (Bio-Rad),
and TaqMan primer-probe mixtures and were partitioned
into oil droplets (~20,000) generated by a QX200 droplet
generator. The droplets were then thermal-cycled under
the same condition described above using Veriti 96-Well
Thermal Cycler (Life Technologies). Amplified droplets
were imaged on a QX200 droplet reader (Bio-Rad) and
analyzed by QuantaSoft™ software (Bio-Rad). The
concentration of nucleic acid sequence targeted by the
FAM and VIC or FAM and HEX dye labeled probes was
estimated by Poisson distribution.

death. J Clin Oncol. 2014; 32:2173–2180.

Statistical analysis
The Kaplan–Meier method was used for univariate
analysis of survival outcomes. Survival outcomes were
compared with the log-rank test. Overall survival was
measured from the date of diagnosis to the date of death
due to any cause and was censored at the date of the last
follow-up visit. A two-sided P value < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
