ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of cancer-related death
worldwide. As vectors for intercellular information exchange, the potential role of
extracellular vesicles (EVs) in HCC formation, progression and therapy has been
widely investigated. In this review, we explore the current status of the researches
in this field. Altogether there is undeniable evidence that EVs play a crucial role in HCC
development, metastasis. Moreover, EVs have shown great potential as drug delivery
systems (DDSs) for the treatment of HCC. Exosomal miRNAs derived from HCC cells
can enhance transformed cell growth in recipient cells by modulating the expression
of transforming growth factor-β activated kinase-1(TAK1) and downstream signaling
molecules. Furthermore, vacuolar protein sortin 4 homolog A(VPS4A) and insulinlike growth factor(IGF)-1 regulate exosome-mediated miRNAs transfer. Immune
cells- derived EVs containing integrin αMβ2 or CD147 may facilitate HCC metastasis.
In addition, EVs-mediated shuttle of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), specifically
linc- VLDLR and linc-ROR promote chemoresistance of malignant cells. Heat shock
proteins (HSPs)-harboring exosomes derived from HCC tumor cells increase the
antitumor effect of natural killer (NK) cells, thus enhancing HCC immunotherapy.
Indeed, inhibition of HCC tumor growth has been associated with tumor cell-derived
exosomes (TEX)-pulsed dentritic cells (DCs). Exosomes are also essential in liver
metastasis during colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas
(PDAC). Therefore, as nucleic acid and drug delivery vehicles, EVs show a tremendous
potential for effective treatment against HCC.

INTRODUCTION

described not only the pathogenesis of HCC development
and metastasis [4-6] but also the multiple treatment
options for HCC treatment, including surgical resection,
orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), transcatheter
arterial chemoembolization (TACE), systemic or regional
chemotherapy, and targeted immunotherapy [7, 8].
Recently, the emerging role of extracellular vesicles (EVs)
in HCC progression and therapy attracted considerable
attention.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most
common incident cancer worldwide and the third leading
cause of cancer death annually [1, 2]. In China, HCC is
one out of the four leading causes of cancer-related death
[3]. The development of primary liver tumors, including
HCC and cholangiocarcinoma are associated with
hepatocyte damage. Large-scales studies have thoroughly

CONTENTS AND FUNCTIONS OF HCCDERIVED EVS

Although EVs - including exosomes and
microvesicles (MVs) - were previously considered
as cellular debris, they are currently well-recognized
vectors for intercellular exchange of information [9].
EVs mediate intercellular communication by transferring
biologically and functionally active proteins and RNA
across cells. Exosomes with 30-120 nm diameter are
formed by release of intracellular multivesicular bodies,
whereas MVs with a 120-1000 nm diameter, are formed
by cell membrane shedding [10]. Many cells, including
neurons [11], dendritic cells (DCs) [12], B cells, T cells,
hepatocytes [13], stem cells [14], erythrocytes [15], mast
cells, epithelial cells [16], tumor cells [17], along with
some multicellular parasites [18-20], have the capacity
to release exosomes. Exosomes can be usually found in
biological fluids such as blood, urine and ascitic fluid [2123] and they are usually detected using presence of CD63,
tumor susceptibility gene(TSG)-101, alix and absence
of endoplasmic reticulum marker Grp94 and calnexin,
peroxisome marker protein (PMP)70, mitochondria
marker COX IV [24-27]. Exosomes have been described
as a means of communication between tumor cells
[28]. Dysregulation in this cell-to-cell communication
and undesirable cellular cross-talks are considered to
contribute to cancer development and progression. A
growing body of evidence already described that uptake
of exosomes stuffed with proteins, mRNAs, miRNAs and
lipids could deliver biological information that regulate
the function of target cells [17, 29]. This mechanism
may explain how exosomes mediate tumor progression
and metastasis. Exosomes interact with their target cells
mainly via fusion of membranes and transfer of exosomal
contents, especially miRNAs.
HCC tumor cell-derived EVs have been reported
to potentially contribute to local spread, intrahepatic
metastases and multifocal growth of HCC [28]. EVsmediated intercellular transfer of biologically active RNA
and proteins might enable HCC cells to affect the tumor
microenvironment, thereby causing HCC development
and metastasis [30]. Experimental and clinical studies
have elucidated the role of EVs in HCC development
and metastasis, in order to be employed in future novel
therapies against HCC including immunotherapy and
chemotherapy, as biomarkers or as drug delivery systems
(DDSs). Among these studies, human HCC cell lines Huh7, HepG2, Hep3G, Hep3B, PLC/PRF/5, SMMC-7721,
HKCI-8, FHCC-98, HKCI-C3, MHCC97L and mouse
HCC cell lines including H22 were used to investigate the
role of EVs in HCC cells in vitro.
Accumulating evidence indicate that EVs are
involved in tumor progression, metastasis, and treatment
failure, thus showing great potential as DDSs for the
treatment of HCC. In the present article, current studies
investigating the mechanism on the contribution of EVs to
HCC development, progression, metastasis and treatment
are reviewed.

Components and tumorigenic mechanism of
HCC-derived exosomes
To rapidly and efficiently extract exosomes secreted
by tumor cells, different methods were explored [31-34].
Among them, sequential ultracentrifugation is the method
of choice to isolate exosomes from culture supernatant of
HCC cells in a consistent manner.
The RNA expression profile of exosomes derived
from human HCC cell lines Hep3B and PLC/PRF/5 was
investigated [28]. Interestingly, the exosomal was below
200 bases in size (mainly miRNAs) with a very low
fraction of internal control genes, including 18S ribosomal
RNA (rRNA), 28S rRNA, small nuclear RNA (snRNA)
U6, small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) U38B and snoRNA
U43 [28]. The expression of 11 miRNAs (miR-584, miR517c, miR-378, miR-520f, miR-142-5p, miR-451, miR518d, miR-215, miR-376a, miR-133b and miR-367)
was specifically detected in Hep3B-derived exosomes,
indicating selective enrichment of a specific set of
miRNAs in HCC-derived exosomes [28]. Similarly, a total
of 20 miRNAs were detected exclusively in PLC/PRF/5derived exosomes. There was a moderate correlation
between the findings in both cell lines, indicating the
existence of a sorting mechanism that guides HCC cells to
secrete specific intracellular miRNAs into exosomes. The
incubation of HCC cells with a neutral sphingomyelinase
2 (nSMase) inhibitor GW4869 resulted in an unchanged
cellular expression and reduced exosomal expression of
miR-16, indicating that the release of specific miRNAs
from HCC cells into exosomes might occur via a ceramide
dependent manner [28, 35]. Interestingly, some of these
miRNAs (e.g. miR-451) were also found to preferentially
enter exosomes in many other cell types [36].
HCC-derived exosomes mediated miRNA transfer
is an important mechanism of environmental modulation
of HCC growth and progress [28]. While being taken
up and internalized, HCC-derived exosomes transfer
their miRNAs contents into recipient cells to mediate
transmission of functional transgenes and genetic
modulation of cellular activities. The transfer of exosomal
miRNAs regulates target gene expression, cell signaling,
biological behavior and transformation of recipient
cells. A combinatorial analysis on 108 potential genes
identified that the transforming growth factor-β activated
kinase-1 (TAK1) pathway might be a very likely candidate
pathway targeted by these miRNAs [28]. TAK1 has been
extensively associated with the activation of signaling
cascades mediated by interleukin(IL)-1, tumor necrosis
factor (TNF-α) and transforming growth factor(TGF)-β
[37]. It is an upstream member of the mitogen-activated
3684

protein (3) kinase(MAP3K) family and an essential
component of cellular homeostasis, intercellular
communication and tumorigenesis in the liver. Loss or
downregulation of TAK1 in hepatocytes is linked to HCC
[38]. The modulation of TAK1 expression and associated
signaling pathways in recipient cells could represent an
important mechanism of exosomal miRNA mediated HCC
tumor progression (Figure 1). HCC-derived exosomes can
transfer their miRNA contents into recipient cells, inhibit
the constitutive expression of TAK1 and downstream
signaling associated with TAK1, and consequently lead
to HCC development and metastasis. In this direction
exosomes derived from Hep3B cells are able to both
increase anchorage-independent growth of transformed
cell and modestly reduce cell viability of recipient cells
[28].
Some exosomal miRNAs and long non-coding
RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in HCC progression and
treatment failure. For the first time, Li et al. reported
that enhanced expression of miR-429 in liver tissue -

caused by hypomethylation may be used as a prognosis
factor in HCC patients [39]. The enrichment of miR429 in HCC cells, especially in epithelial cell adhesion
molecule (EPCAM)+ -tumor initiating cells (T-ICs) could
lead to shedding of miR-429-harboring exosomes, thus
facilitating tumor formation. These exosomes could
shuttle and relocate miR-429 into their surrounded target
cells, targeting Rb binding protein 4 (RBBP4) expression
and further promoting the transcriptional activity of
E2F1, finally upregulating the expression of POU class 5
homeobox 1(POU5F1) [39] in recipient cells. As a result,
exosomes crucially contribute to hepatocyte self-renewal,
tumorigenicity, malignant proliferation, chemoresistance
and progression. Furthermore, exosomal transfer of the
lncRNA regulator of reprogramming (linc-RoR) may
contribute to failure of anticancer therapies and HCC
development by increasing HCC resistance against
adverse environmental conditions, such as hypoxia [40].
The levels of linc-RoR in normal hepatocytes are low [40]
potentially inhibiting cell proliferation and tumorigenesis,

Figure 1: HCC-derived exosomal miRNAs may mediate tumor progression through modulating the TAK1associated signaling pathway in recipient cells. TAK1 is involved in the activation of signaling cascades mediated by IL-1, TNF-α,

TGF-β in physiological conditions (black arrows). After uptake of HCC-derived exosomes by neighboring cells present in the tumor
microenvironment, the given exosomal miRNAs can down-regulate the constitutive expression of TAK1, TAB 2/3 in recipient cells and
restrain the phosphorylation of TAB1, TAB2/3 and TAK1. Activation of their three main downstream signaling pathways, including IKK
α/β-NF-kB, MKK4/7-JNK-API and MKK3/6-p38/MAPK-CREB is then suppressed. The pathological unbalance finally causes failure of
cellular homeostasis, leading to tumorigenesis in the liver and HCC tumor progression. (Abbreviation: TAB, TAK-1 binding protein; IKK,

CHEMORESISTANCE AND POTENTIAL
IMMUNOTHERAPY

in part, by specifically increasing stability of the c-myc
mRNA [41]. High expression of linc-RoR in HCC
decreases the expression of miR-145, a linc-RoR target,
thereby increasing hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α)
and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 1 (PDK1)
protein expression, overall improving mitochondrial
function during hypoxia via the tricarboxylic acid cycle
in recipient cells. Similarly, Takayuki and collaborators
demonstrated that the most highly expressed lncRNA
in HCC cell-derived EVs was TUC339. Suppression of
TUC339 with short interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly
reduced HCC cell proliferation and adhesion. Therefore,
EVs-mediated transfer of lncRNA-TUC339 is a unique
signaling mechanism to promote HCC growth and
metastasis [42].

Immune cells-derived EVs facilitate HCC
metastasis
Immune cells such as immature myeloid cells,
macrophages, and mast cells are considered the roots of
metastasis of tumor cells [47, 48]. In a recent study [49]
murine innate immune cells-derived microparticles (MPs)
were co-cultured with H22 tumor cells, leading to tumor
cell migration, invasion, attachment to the endothelium
in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Indeed, MPs mediate the
acquisition of a metastatic phenotype by HCC cells via
the effective relay of integrin αMβ2 (CD11b/CD18) from
stimulated innate immune cells. These findings reveal
that HCC tumor cells may usurp the phenotype of innate
immune cells through MPs in order to metastasize.
In patients with HCC, stromal and vascular invasions
contribute to tumor progression. Kornek and colleagues
indicated that MPs containing CD147 can be released
by human T cells, stimulating the expression of matrix
metalloproteinases (MMP) in fibroblasts and thus
facilitating tumor invasion and metastasis [50].

HCC suppressors/promoters exert effects by
exosome-mediated miRNAs shuttle
Based on the evidence that vacuolar protein sorting
4 homolog A (Vps4A) is frequently down-regulated in
human HCC tissue and that Vps4A represses the colony
formation, migration, growth and invasion of HCC cells
in vitro, Vps4A was identified as a HCC suppressor
[43]. Vps4A utilized exosomes as mediators to modulate
secretion, uptake and final profiles of miRNAs in HCC
cells [43]. In this study, Wei and colleagues compared
SMMC-7721 cells transfected with either Vps4A (SMMCVps4A) or exosomes secreted by SMMC-Vps4A (SMMCVps4A-exo). They observed that Vps4A suppressed
the bioactivity of exosomes via selectively packaging
oncogenic miR-27b-3p and miR-92a-3p into exosomes
and accumulating tumor-suppressive miR-193a-3p, miR320a, and miR-132-3p in HCC cells. Moreover, they
demonstrated that Vps4A decreased the recipient HCC cell
response to exosomes via selective uptake of exosomal
tumor-suppressive miR-122-5p, miR-33a-5p, miR-34a-5p,
miR-193a-3p, miR-16-5p, and miR-29b-3p.
However, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)
is considered as a HCC promoter since it can override
homeostasis and lead to tumor progression during the
initial steps of HCC development [44]. Expression
of tumor suppressor miR-122, a liver-specific antiproliferative miRNA, is usually down-regulated in
HCC cells compared with that in normal hepatocytes
surrounding the tumor [45]. Transfer of exosomal miR122 from healthy hepatocytes inhibits tumor progression.
However, this method for the maintainance of homeostasis
cannot be kept for a long time. T-ICs subsequently release
IGF-1 to prevent miR-122 production in neighbouring
normal hepatocytes and thereby curtail its intercellular
transfer within exosomes, leading to low levels of the antiproliferative miRNA in HCC cells. Thus eventually tumor
progression and metastasis occurs [46].

EVs-mediated delivery of special proteins
promote HCC invasion and migration
The uptake of exosomes from invasive HCC cell
lines can trigger the activation of phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) and mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways,
which resulting in increased secretion of active MMP,
enhanced migratory and invasive abilities of non-motile
immortalized hepatocytes [24]. This may potentially lead
to increased protrusive activity of HCC cells through
the liver parenchyma during the process of metastasis.
An in vitro study [51] demonstrated that up-regulation
of annexin A2 (ANXA2) in HCC cells contributes to the
expression of CD147, carried by their MVs. Moreover,
highly expressed CD147 is responsible for the increased
production of MMP-2 by fibroblasts in the liver stroma,
thereby leading to HCC cells invasion and migration.
Vasorin (VASN) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that
plays an important role in vasculogenesis and tumor
development [52]. Progression of HCC greatly depends on
the communication between cancer cells and endothelial
cells, which is mediated by tumor-derived exosomes.
Exosomal transfer of VASN from HCC cells promotes
mobility properties in hepatic endothelial cells, inducing
cancer cell migration to the surrounding tissue [53](Table
1).

EVs participate in inducing chemoresistance in
HCC

EV-mediated transfer of linc-VLDLR is involved
in HCC tumor cell response to chemotherapy by
modulating cell-cell communication in the tumor
microenvironment [55]. The essential role of VLDLR in
mediating HCC chemoresistance was confirmed using
linc-VLDLR which enhanced the expression of ATPbinding cassette sub-family G member 2(ABCG2) and
increased chemotherapy- induced cell death, abrogated
cell cycle progression and decreased cell viability [55].

HCC is a chemorefractory cancer and highly
resistant to chemotherapy, limiting the effectiveness of
anticancer agents [54]. Thus there is an urgent need for
more efficient chemotherapeutic agents which overcome
the mechanisms of chemoresistance in HCC cells.

Multidrug resistance is caused by overexpression of efflux
transporters (such as P-glycoprotein), and exosomes can
transfer P-glycoprotein intercellularly from multidrugresistant donor cells to drug-sensitive recipient cells
[56], thereby favoring multidrug resistance. During
chemotherapeutic stress, TGF-β increases the expression
of CD133+ cells and colony growth partly due to the
selective enrichment and high expression of lincRNAROR (linc-ROR) within exosomes, overall inducing
increased resistance of HCC cells to chemotherapy [57].
Considering the functional role of linc-ROR in TGF-βdependent chemoresistance, the knockdown of ROR using
exosomal siRNA delivery to enhance chemotherapyinduced apoptosis and cytotoxicity might be a potential
therapy for the treatment of HCC.
However, MVs secreted by tumor-associated
macrophages (TAMs) mediate effective HCC
chemotherapy. In fact, propofol inhibits HCC cell
invasiveness, viability and proliferation [58]. Macrophage
activation and shuttling of miR-142-3p containing MVs
from TAMs to HCC cells stimulated by propofol might
be the underlying mechanism, leading to down-regulation
of RAC1 - a target gene of miR-142-3p- expression ,
and thereby inhibiting tumor cell growth, migration and
invasion [59].

immunity [63]. More importantly, intravenous injection
of HCC TEX-pulsed DCs improves the tumor immune
microenvironment, in terms of increased T cells and
interferon(IFN)-γ levels and decreased IL-10 and TGF-β
in tumor sites [63]. Additionally, several phase I clinical
trials have used tumor-derived exosomes or exosomepulsed DC as cancer vaccines [64, 65].

ROLES OF EXOSOMES IN LIVER
METASTASIS OF TUMOR
The chief cause of death in cancer patients is tumor
metastasis [66] and the liver is one of the most commonly
invaded sites. In most cases, liver metastases are derived
from a colorectal or pancreatic tumor [67] [68] [69].
Several groups have demonstrated the pivotal
role of exosomes in metastatic progression of colorectal
carcinoma (CRC) [66]. The incubation of HepG2 cells
with SW480 colorectal cancer cells-derived exosomes
in vitro results in enhanced ability of HepG2 cell
migration via activation of MAPK and extracellular
signal regulated kinases (ERK)1/2 in recipient cells [70].
Besides, shuttling of exosomal microRNA (e.g. miR-21
[70] and miR-181a [71]) might mediate liver metastases
of CRC by suppressing their target genes phosphatase
and tensin homolog (PTEN), programmed cell death
4(PDCD4) or Wnt inhibitor factor(WIF)-1 in hepatocytes.
Furthermore, it has been reported that HT-29 CRC cells
are highly metastatic to the liver while Caco-2 CRC cells
are poorly metastatic. A Chinese report [66] indicated
that the administration of HT-29-derived exosomes
to Caco-2-inoculated nude mice led to a pronounced
enhancement of metastasis of Caco-2 cells to the liver.
The underlying mechanism might be that HT-29-derived
exosomes increase C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4
(CXCR4) expression in liver stromal cells, promoting
a pro-inflammatory environment in the liver that favors
metastasis.
The liver is also the most common organ in
metastases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs)
[69]. Costa-Silva et al. clarified that PDACs-derived
exosomes prime the liver for metastasis via pre-metastatic
niche formation in the liver, in which highly expressed
migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in PDAC-derived
exosomes is very likely to be involved [72, 73] (Figure
2). Further studies are needed to show which exosomes
components are involved in liver metastasis in different
cancer cell types.

Exosomes mediating in enhanced immunotherapy
of HCC
HCC is notoriously difficult to treat due to the
unique immune tolerogenicity nature of the liver [60],
however recent studies have reported that exosomes
can counterbalance the hepatic immunosuppressive
environment. The stress-induced extracellular heat
shock proteins(HSPs) are known to confer tumor
immunogenicity and induce natural killer (NK) cell
antitumor responses [61]. Upon stimulation with
chemotherapeutic drugs, HCC cells release HSP-bearing
exosomes which enhance the cytolytic activity of NK
cells and elicit efficient HSP-specific anti-HCC responses
in vitro [62]. HCC-resistant or sensitive anticancer drugs
differ in their ability to stimulate the production of HSPbearing exosomes in HCC cells . Resistant anticancer
drugs such as carboplatin and irinotecan hydrochloride
generate more exosome-carried HSPs, which could upregulate the expression of activating receptor CD69,
NKG2D, NKp44, and down-regulate inhibitory receptor
CD94 expression in NK cell, increasing granzyme B
production and activating the NK cell cytotoxic response
[62]. Thus, HSP-expressing exosomes can be potentially
used as vehicles carrying therapeutic vaccines for HCC
immunotherapy. A recent study using murine and human
HCC cell lines demonstrated that DCs pulsed with
HCC tumor cell-derived exosomes (TEX) can definitely
elicit tumor suppression by improving tumor-specific

phenotype to cholangiocytes [74]. Authors showed that
EVs internalization by cholangiocytes in vitro lead to
cholangiocarcinoma formation via enhanced production
of IL-6, cell proliferation, dysregulated expression of
cancer-associated proteins (e.g. PAK-2, a kinase that
mediates tumor cell invasion; ZO-2, a tight junction
protein), and proteins involved in the proteasome
complex [74]. Vaccines, which target tetraspanin 1, a
key EV surface molecule, and subsequently interrupt the

shown great potential in the treatment of infection-derived
cholangiocarcinoma.

cell niche and thereby favoring tumor initiation [78-80].
Consistently, exosomes derived from MSCs induced the
inhibition of HCC cell proliferation and growth both
in vitro and in vivo, by exosomal delivery of selective
proteins, mRNAs and miRNAs into HCC cells. In stem
cell-based therapies, adipose- and bone marrow-derived
MSCs are commonly used.
Sheung-Fat et al. conducted the first animal
study using adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells
(AMSC)-derived exosomes for the treatment of HCC.
The authors evaluated the effects of AMSCs-derived
exosomes on N1S1 rat HCC cells inoculation-induced
ectopic hepatoma in vivo [77]. Interestingly, AMSCderived exosomes facilitated HCC suppression mainly
by increasing intratumoral and circulating NK T-cells
[81]. In their study, the exosome-treated rats harbored
more intratumoral invariant CD8𝛼+ NK T-cells and
circulating protective NK T-suppressing HCC growth.
Considering that several miRNAs are associated with
potential antitumor activity, AMSC exosomes were used
for these miRNAs delivery [82, 83]. Since MiR-122 is a
liver-specific anti-proliferative miRNA [84], miR-122laden AMSC exosomes rendered HCC cells sensitive to
chemotherapeutic agents both in vitro and in vivo [85],
indicating that AMSC exosome might be novel carrier
molecules for antitumor miRNAs in HCC treatment.
Similarly, MVs derived from bone marrow MSCs
(BMSCs) inhibit cell cycle progression and induce
apoptosis in HepG2 cells in vitro. Moreover, in vivo intra-

have investigated the biological effect of MSCs on HCC
tumor growth and progression [75-77]. Most studies
demonstrated an antitumorigenic effect of MSCs in HCC
growth and cell proliferation; however, several reports
have postulated that MSCs could also be protumorigenic

IGF1-R. Moreover, transfection of donor cells with
selective miRNA expression plasmids, high levels of
these miRNAs are detected in their EVs. Lou showed that
AMSC transfected with a miR-122 expression plasmid
increase the therapeutic effect of chemotherapeutic
agents such as 5-fluorouracil or sorafenib on 122-Exotreated HCC cells. Thus, increased sensitivity of HCC
cells to sorafenib by 122-Exo administration depends on
exosome-mediated miR-122 transfer and down-regulation
of miR-122-target genes is involved in the antitumor
activity of sorafenib in vivo [85]. MSC is well suited for
mass production of exosomes that are ideal for drug or
miRNA delivery [91]. AMSC-derived exosome is a safe
and effective vehicle for miR-122 delivery, and a key
factor in miR-122-mediated chemotherapy sensitization.
Furthermore, exosomes can be manufactured in culture
by incorporating therapeutic miR-122 into exosome
producing cells, thereby enabling personalized treatment
[82]. Delivery of miR-122 via AMSC exosomes with
use of chemotherapeutic agents results in enhancement
of cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G0/G1, what
represents a promising strategy for HCC chemotherapy.
In addition, exosomes from AMSCs have also been tested
as an effective vehicle to package and deliver therapeutic
siRNA [92] and active drugs such as paclitaxel [93].
Improvement in the methodology for AMSC culture and
exosome purification will definitely increase the feasibility
and safety of AMSC-derived exosome therapy in clinical
treatment of HCC.
Similarly, the ability of intestinal epithelial cells
Caco-2-derived MVs has been investigated as a vehicle
for transfer of miR-168a to HCC cells. Caco-2 transfected
by miR-168a expression plasmid secrete MVs containing
these plant miRNAs. Thus, co-culture of these MVs with
HepG2 might trigger transfer of specific miR-168a to
human hepatocytes resulting in a 100-fold increase of the
miR-168a levels and significant decreased expression of
the miR-168a target protein [94].

tumor administration of BMSCs-derived MVs in tumors
remarkably inhibited tumor growth [75]. The possible
mechanism was not investigated. Although BMSCs
could effectively inhibit HCC growth and progression
via their MVs, homologous TEX-pulsed BMSCs possess
stronger migratory capacity and exhibit more effective
antitumor activities in HCC treatment than BMSCs alone,
representing an innovative and alternative antitumor
therapy. In the same direction, Ma [76] reported that
murine homologous TEX-pulsed BMSCs could inhibit
proliferation of H22 cells in vitro, as indicated by cell
cycle arrest at G0/G1phase and significantly decreased
PCNA protein expression in these cells. Previous studies
[86-88] found that the antitumor activity of BMSCs may
be significantly enhanced by cytokines such as IL-2 and
IFN-γ. Indeed, BMSCs pulsed with TEX also exhibit
enhanced migratory capacity, indicating that TEX could
endow MSCs with greater migration ability and tumor
tropism. BMSCs might uptake and present antigens, major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) complexes and HSP of
TEX, to induce effective antigen-specific cellular immune
responses. This results in enhanced antitumor activity
against HCC, very likely the underlying mechanism.
Besides, human adult liver stem cells-derived MPs induce
apoptosis and inhibit the proliferation of HepG2 cells in
vitro and suppress growth of HCC xenografts in SCID
mice by delivering antitumor miRNAs (miR451, miR223,
miR24, miR31, miR214, and miR122), that down-regulate
MDR1, MIF, ras-related protein 14(RAB14) and E2F-2
[89].
Altogether, these studies suggest that MVs
derived from stem cells may inhibit HCC tumor growth
and stimulate apoptosis in a variety of ways, including
delivery of selected miRNAs, modulation of NK T-cell
responses or antigen-specific T cellular immune responses.
Regardless of the mechanisms, the complex antitumor
capacity of MVs derived from MSCs or MSCs pulsed with
homologous/autologous TEX in HCC treatment needs
further investigation.

EVS AND DRUG DELIVERY

AMSCs-derived EVs as miR-122 vehicle increase
HCC chemosensitivity

HCC is highly resistant to chemotherapy. Sorafenib,
5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin are currently being used
for systemic or locoregional therapies against HCC but
exhibit limited efficacy. Therefore, the discovery of new
therapeutic targets and the development of novel clinical
approaches to enhance HCC chemosensitivity are urgently
needed. Therefore, the use of exosomes/EVs as nucleic
acid (miRNA, lncRNA, siRNA, mRNA, DNA) and drug
delivery vehicles has gained considerable interest due to
their excellent biodistribution and biocompatibility.

Contrary to lincROR mediating TGF β-dependent
chemoresistance, miR-122 promotes chemosensitivity of
HCC cells. MiR-122 is a liver-specific anti-proliferative
miRNA that can be transferred via exosomes between
human hepatoma cells. The loss or down-regulation of
miR-122 has been associated with HCC development and
progression and is closely related to poor prognosis and
metastasis of HCC [45, 90]. Moreover, high profiles of
miR-122 render cancer cells sensitive to chemotherapeutic
agents through down-regulation of miR-122-target genes
expression in HCC cells, including cyclin G1 (CCNG1),
a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10), and

CONCLUSIONS
Altogether, these data suggest that EVs play multiple
roles in mediating progression, metastasis and thus can

be used as a potential therapy for the treatment of HCC.
Further investigations are needed to shed more light on
the role of EVs in HCC development and its application
in the clinic.
