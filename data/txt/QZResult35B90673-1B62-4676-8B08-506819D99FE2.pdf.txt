Abstract
Acid exerts pro-proliferative effects in Barrett’s-associated
esophageal adenocarcinoma cells. In non-neoplastic Barrett’s
epithelial (BAR-T) cells, in contrast, we have shown that
acid exposure has antiproliferative effects. To explore our
hypothesis that the acid-induced, antiproliferative effects are
mediated by alterations in the proteins that regulate the G1-S
cell cycle checkpoint, we exposed non-neoplastic Barrett’s
cells to acidic media (pH 4.0) and analyzed G1-S checkpoint
proteins’ expression, phosphorylation, and activity levels by
Western blot. We studied acid effects on growth (by cell
counts), proliferation (by flow cytometry and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation), cell viability (by trypan blue staining),
and apoptosis (by annexin V staining), and we used caffeine
and small interfering RNA to assess the effects of checkpoint
kinase 2 (Chk2) inhibition on G1-S progression. Acid exposure
significantly decreased cell numbers without affecting cell
viability and with only a slight increase in apoptosis. Within
2 h of acid exposure, there was a delay in progression through
the G1-S checkpoint that was associated with increased
phosphorylation of Chk2, decreased levels of Cdc25A, and
decreased activity of cyclin E–cyclin-dependent kinase 2; by
4 h, a continued delay at G1-S was associated with increased
expression of p53 and p21. Caffeine and Chk2 siRNA abolished
the acid-induced G1-S delay at 2 but not at 4 h. We conclude
that acid exposure in non-neoplastic BAR-T cells causes early
antiproliferative effects that are mediated by the activation of
Chk2. Thus, we have elucidated a mechanism whereby acid
can exert disparate effects on proliferation in neoplastic and
non-neoplastic BAR-T cells. [Cancer Res 2007;67(18):8580–7]

Introduction
In the last three decades, the incidence of esophageal
adenocarcinoma has increased f600% in the United States (1, 2).
The major risk factors for this cancer are gastroesophageal reflux
disease (GERD) and Barrett’s esophagus, the condition in which a
metaplastic, intestinal-type epithelium replaces esophageal squamous epithelium that has been damaged by GERD. This
metaplastic epithelium is predisposed to malignancy, and most
esophageal adenocarcinomas are thought to arise from Barrett’s
esophagus (3, 4).

It has been proposed that acid reflux promotes the progression
of Barrett’s metaplasia to esophageal adenocarcinoma, based
largely on the observations that acid exposure can induce proproliferative effects in cultures of Barrett’s biopsy specimens
(explants) and in cultures of Barrett’s-associated esophageal
adenocarcinoma cells (5–7). Those in vitro model systems are
not ideal for the study of the early carcinogenetic events in Barrett’s
epithelial (BAR-T) cells, however. Explants of Barrett’s mucosa
comprise both epithelial and non-epithelial cell types (e.g.,
inflammatory and stromal cells), and it is difficult to ascertain
which of the diverse cell types proliferate in response to acid.
Barrett’s-associated adenocarcinoma cells have numerous uncharacterized genetic abnormalities, and acid-induced events in those
cells may not reflect the effects of acid on non-neoplastic BAR-T
cells.
To develop an in vitro model for Barrett’s esophagus that avoids
the pitfalls of explants and adenocarcinoma cell cultures, we have
established cultures of BAR-T cells that are immortalized, but not
transformed, through the forced expression of telomerase (8). We
have shown that these cells retain a diploid karyotype, express
differentiation markers typical of benign Barrett’s epithelium, and
exhibit phenotypic features characteristic of non-neoplastic cells,
including contact inhibition, anchorage-dependent growth, and the
expression of functional cell cycle checkpoint proteins (8). Using
cultures of BAR-T cells, we have found that acid exerts antiproliferative effects (9).
Cellular proliferation is a manifestation of passage through the
cell cycle, which is regulated at various checkpoints. Genomic
damage can activate cell cycle checkpoints to halt progression
through the cycle, enabling the cell to repair its DNA damage or, if
the damage is extensive and irreparable, to trigger cellular
destruction by apoptosis (10). Many crucial cell fate decisions
are made at the key checkpoint that regulates the transition from
G1 to S phase. Therefore, a potential mechanism whereby acid
exposure could influence proliferation and apoptosis in BAR-T cells
is by affecting the proteins that regulate the G1-S cell cycle
checkpoint.
A number of proteins are known to influence passage through
the G1-S cell cycle checkpoint. For example, Cdc25A can activate
the cyclin E–cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) complex, which
enables progression through the G1-S checkpoint (10, 11). In
contrast, progression through the checkpoint can be blocked by
activating the p53 pathway, which results in the transcription of
genes like p21 whose products inhibit the actions of cyclin-Cdk
complexes. G1-S progression can also be delayed by activating the
checkpoint kinases 1 and 2 (Chk1 and Chk2), which mediate the
degradation of Cdc25A (10). To investigate mechanisms whereby
acid reflux might influence proliferation and apoptosis in Barrett’s

Acid Activates Chk2 in Barrett’s Cells

esophagus, we exposed our BAR-T cells to acid and studied the
resulting effects on cell growth and on proteins that regulate the
G1-S cell cycle checkpoint.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. We used three telomerase-immortalized, nontransformed,
BAR-T cell lines (BAR-T, BAR-T 9, and BAR-T 10) created from endoscopic
biopsy specimens of non-dysplastic Barrett’s specialized intestinal metaplasia taken from three patients with long-segment (>3-cm) Barrett’s
esophagus. The cells were cultured in growth media consisting of
supplemented keratinocyte basal media, KBM-2 (Cambrex Biologicals)
and maintained as previously described (8, 12). For individual experiments,
cells were equally seeded into collagen IV–coated wells (BD Biosciences)
and maintained in growth media. We selected to use the BAR-T line for all
experiments unless otherwise indicated because this line has been
extensively characterized by our laboratory (8, 9, 13).
Acid exposure. For individual experiments, the cells were cultured either
in neutral full-growth media (pH 7.2) or in acidic full-growth media
(brought to a pH of 4.0 with 1 mol/L HCl). The neutral or acidic media was
added for 10 min (unless otherwise indicated) to equally seeded wells of
Barrett’s cells and then removed and replaced with neutral pH media for the
remainder of the experiment.
Determination of cell number, cell viability, apoptosis, and cell cycle
distribution. At 24 h after acid exposure, cell number was determined by
cell counts with a Z1 particle counter, and cell viability was assessed by
trypan blue staining. Apoptosis rates were assessed by analysis of annexin V
(BD Biosciences) and propidium iodide (PI; Sigma) staining by flow
cytometry (9); cells staining only with annexin V were considered to be
apoptotic. Cellular morphology was documented using the Metamorph
imaging system (Universal Imaging Corporation); UV-B irradiated cells were
used as a positive control (13). For cell-cycle analyses, Barrett’s cells were
synchronized for 24 h in KBM-2 lacking growth factor and serum
supplementation and then allowed to recover for 14 h in the neutral pH
growth media before a 10-min acid exposure. Cells were collected just
before release in neutral pH growth media (time 0) and at 2 and 4 h after
the acid exposure or neutral pH media change (time points that correspond
to 16 and 18 h after release into growth media, respectively). Before analysis
by flow cytometry, cells were stained with 50 Ag/mL of PI. Cell proliferation
was also assessed using the Cell Proliferation ELISA (Roche) per
manufacturer’s instructions.
Western blotting. Cells were exposed to 10 min of acid or neutral pH
media change, and lysates were collected immediately thereafter (time 0)
and at various other time points using Cell Signaling lysis buffer
supplemented with 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and
then sonicated briefly. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDSPAGE; protein concentrations were determined using the BCA-200 Protein
Assay kit (Pierce). After separation and transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride
(PVDF) membranes, the membranes were incubated with 1:1,000 dilutions
of mouse monoclonal anti-human p53, Cdk4 (Calbiochem), or Cdc25A
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:500 dilutions of mouse monoclonal antihuman p21 (Oncogene), 1:1,000 dilutions of rabbit polyclonal anti-human
p53 (Ser15), total Chk1, phospho-Chk1 (Ser317 and Ser345), total Chk2, or
phospho-Chk2 (Thr68; Cell Signaling). For detection of phospho-Cdk2
(Thr14/Tyr15; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), equal amounts of protein were
immunoprecipitated for 3 h at 4jC with saturating amounts of anti–
phospho-Cdk2 (Thr14/Tyr15), followed by overnight incubation with protein
A–sepharose beads at 4jC. Sepharose-bound immunoprecipitated proteins
were then washed thrice with ice-cold lysis buffer, followed by separation
and transfer to PVDF membranes. The membranes were incubated with
1:1,000 dilutions of rabbit polyclonal anti-human total Cdk2 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Anti-mouse (1:5,000) or anti-rabbit (1:2,000) horseradish
peroxidase secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used, and
chemiluminescence was determined using the Super Signal West Dura
detection system (Pierce). All studies were done in duplicate. Membranes
were then stripped using Restore Stripping Buffer (Pierce) and reprobed
with h-actin (Sigma) to confirm equal loading. Relative band intensities

www.aacrjournals.org

were determined by densitometry using the MultiAnalyst software package
(Bio-Rad).
Cyclin-Cdk assays. For cyclin E–Cdk2 activity assays, cells were exposed
to 10 min of acid, and lysates were collected immediately thereafter (time 0)
and at various other time points. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at
14,000  g for 10 min at 4jC. Following a bicinchoninic acid protein assay,
equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4jC with
saturating amounts of agarose-conjugated anti–cyclin E (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitated proteins were then washed thrice
with ice-cold lysis buffer and then twice with ice-cold kinase buffer (Cell
Signaling). Cyclin E–Cdk2 kinase activity was determined using histone H1
as the substrate for in vitro phosphorylation. The agarose bound with cyclin
E–Cdk2 complexes was resuspended in 10 AL of kinase buffer containing
0.25 Ag/AL histone H1 (Roche), 40 Amol/L ATP (Sigma), and 0.5 ACi/AL
[g-32P] ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated at 30jC for 30 min. The
kinase reaction was stopped by adding 3 AL of 4 electrophoresis sample
buffer, followed by boiling for 3 min at 95jC. The reaction products were
then electrophoresed on 12% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by
autoradiography of the dried slab gels. For cyclin D1–Cdk4 immunoprecipitation and activity assays, the same protocol was followed except that
we used agarose-conjugated anti-cyclin D1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
40 Amol/L ATP, and the Rb-C fusion protein (2 Ag/20 AL reaction), containing residues 701 to 928, which include the sites of phosphorylation by
Cdk4 as the substrate (14–16). Western blot was done using 1:1,000 dilutions
of rabbit polyclonal anti-human phospho-Rb (Ser795; Cell Signaling).
Chk inhibitors. The Chk2 pathway was blocked using 10 mmol/L
caffeine (Sigma), an inhibitor of the ATM/ATR kinases, which are
immediately upstream of Chk2, and using SMARTpool siRNA duplexes
against Chk2 (Upstate Biotechnology; ref. 17). Equally seeded wells of
Barrett’s cells were transiently transfected with 200 nmol/L siRNA using
LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. As controls, cells were transfected with nonspecific control
SMARTpool siRNA oligonucleotides (Upstate) or treated with LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent alone. Cells were pretreated with caffeine for 1 h and
then exposed to acidic media containing caffeine for 10 min. Forty-eight
hours after transfection with Chk2 siRNA, cells were exposed to acid for
10 min.
Statistical analyses. Quantitative data are expressed as the mean F SE.
Statistical analysis was done using either the unpaired Student’s t test or an
ANOVA in combination with the Student-Newman-Keuls multiple-comparison test with the Instat for Windows statistical software package
(GraphPad Software). P values <0.05 were considered significant for all
analyses.

Results
Acid exposure decreases BAR-T cell numbers at 24 h. We
have previously found that two, 3-min acid exposures given 60 min
apart decreases the cell number of BAR-T cells (9). To determine
the effect of a single acid exposure, Bar-T cells were given a single
3- or 10-min acid exposure, and cell numbers were determined.
These durations were chosen to simulate typical, physiologic
episodes of gastroesophageal reflux (18). Compared with no acid
treatment, a single acid exposure given for either 3 or 10 min
significantly decreased cell numbers at 24 h (Fig. 1A). After
reviewing these data, we selected to use the 10-min acid exposure
for all further experiments. We then determined the effect of a
single, 10-min acid exposure in two additional telomeraseimmortalized metaplastic Barrett’s cell lines (BAR-T9 and BART10). Compared with no acid treatment, a single 10-min acid
exposure significantly decreased cell numbers at 24 h in all three
Barrett’s cell lines (Fig. 1B).
Acid exposure does not affect cell viability, but causes a
small increase in apoptosis. To explore the mechanisms
underlying the acid-induced decrease in cell number, we studied

cell viability and apoptosis. Trypan blue staining revealed no
significant difference in cell viability between acid-exposed and
nonexposed cells at 24 h (data not shown). We also found no
difference in morphology between acid-exposed and nonexposed
cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast, UV-B irradiation resulted in small and
shrunken cells, phenotypic changes suggestive of apoptosis
(Fig. 2A). Using annexin V and PI staining, however, we found a
small but statistically significant increase in the fraction of
apoptotic cells in the acid-exposed group (3.8 F 0.37% SE)
compared with untreated control cells (2.7 F 0.14% SE; Fig. 2B).
Acid exposure decreases proliferation by delaying G1 to S
phase transition. Having found that neither decreased cell
viability nor increased apoptosis could account for the decreased
cell number following acid exposure, we next determined whether
acid delayed progression from G1 to S phase. Cells were
synchronized for 24 h in KBM-2 lacking growth factor and serum
supplementation, followed by release into growth media. In
preliminary time course experiments, we determined that movement from G1 into S occurred between 12 and 18 h after release
into growth media (data not shown). Therefore, BAR-T cells were
released into growth media for 14 h and then exposed to acid for
10 min. Movement from G1 to S phase was analyzed by flow
cytometry 2 and 4 h after acid exposure (time points that
correspond to 16 and 18 h after release into the growth media,
respectively). At 2 h, the fraction of cells in G1 remained higher in

the acid-treated group, although this difference was not statistically
significant (P = 0.11; Fig. 3A). Moreover, the fraction of cells in the S
phase at this 2-h time point was significantly lower in the acidtreated group (Fig. 3A). The acid-induced decrease in cells entering
the S phase at 2 h was confirmed by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd)
incorporation (Fig. 3B). By 4 h, the fraction of cells remaining in G1
was significantly higher, and the fraction of cells in S remained
significantly lower in the acid-exposed cells (Fig. 3A). There was no
significant difference in the fraction of cells in G2 at either time
point between acid-exposed and nonexposed cells (data not
shown). Compared with the 2-h time point, furthermore, the
4-h time point had a significantly smaller fraction of cells in G1
[76.6 F 0.3% versus 89.3 F 2.8%; P = 0.01] and a significantly larger
fraction of cells in the S phase (229.6 F 1.5% versus 181.0 F 1.8%;
P < 0.0001), suggesting that the acid caused a delay in progression
from G1 to S rather than a complete G1 arrest (Fig. 3A).
Acid exposure increases expression of p53, phospho-p53
Ser15, and p21. Because p53 and its downstream transcriptional
target, p21, are known to play key regulatory roles in the G1-S cell
cycle checkpoint, we investigated the effect of acid exposure on the
expression of p53 and p21 proteins (19). Furthermore, because sitespecific phosphorylation of p53 can determine whether the protein
mediates transcriptional activity (Ser15 phosphorylation) or apoptotic activity (Ser46 phosphorylation), these two phosphorylated
forms of p53 were also investigated (20, 21). Total p53, phospho-p53
(Ser15 and Ser46), and p21 protein expression were determined by
Western blot immediately after acid exposure (time 0) and at 15
and 30 min, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h later. Total p53 expression increased
beginning at 1 h and remained elevated at 6 h following acid
exposure (Fig. 4). Phospho-p53 Ser15 also increased beginning at
1 h, with maximal expression by 4 h (Fig. 4). There was no
expression of phospho-p53 Ser46 at any of the time points (data not
shown). Increased p21 expression was not apparent until 4 h after
acid exposure (Fig. 4). Thus, acid exposure increases the expression
of p53, phospho-p53 Ser15, and p21 but not phospho-p53 Ser46 in
BAR-T cells. We noted that although the increase in p21 expression
did not appear until 4 h after the acid exposure, the delay in G1-S
transition was evident by 2 h. This suggests that induction of p21
by p53 was not responsible for the early, acid-induced delay in G1-S
transition (Figs. 3A and 4). Therefore, we next investigated
expression levels of Cdc25A, a protein known to regulate a rapid
G1-S checkpoint response.
Acid exposure rapidly decreases the levels of Cdc25A
protein and cyclin E activity. G1-S regulation has been observed
in cells that lack p53 and p21 (22, 23). Cdc25A may serve as an early
regulator of that checkpoint. Cdc25A activates cyclin-Cdk complexes by dephosphorylating the Cdk, and if Cdc25A levels
decrease, progression through the G1-S checkpoint is halted rapidly
(10, 24). We investigated whether acid exposure altered expression
levels of Cdc25A, phospho-Cdk2 (Thr14/Tyr15), and activities of the
Cdk4/6–cyclin D1 and Cdk2–cyclin E complexes. Western blots
showed that Cdc25A expression levels decreased immediately after
acid exposure (time 0), with the lowest levels found at 15 to 30 min;
levels returned to baseline by 2 h (Fig. 4). Levels of phospho-Cdk2
(Thr14/Tyr15) increased immediately after acid exposure and
remained elevated at 2 h; levels returned to baseline by 4 h after
exposure (Fig. 4). Cdk2–cyclin E activity (measured as phosphorylation of histone H1) decreased immediately after acid exposure
(time 0) with the lowest levels found at 15 to 30 min (Fig. 4).
However, there was no difference in Cdk4/6-cyclin D1 activity
(measured as phospho-Rb) following acid exposure at any of the

Acid Activates Chk2 in Barrett’s Cells

the results of optical morphology for acid-exposed

Note that UV-B irradiation at 200 J/m2 induced
features of apoptosis in the Barrett’s cells. No such
morphologic features were seen following acid
exposure. B, results of acid exposures on

time points examined (Fig. 4). These data suggest that acid causes a
rapid decrease in Cdc25A levels, which is accompanied by
persistent phosphorylation of Cdk2 and decreased activity of the
Cdk2–cyclin E complex. These changes may contribute to the early
acid-induced delay in progression through the G1-S checkpoint in
BAR-T cells.
Acid exposure increases levels of phospho-Chk2. Chk1 and
Chk2 are serine/threonine kinases that, when activated by
phosphorylation, transfer phosphate groups to Cdc25A, thereby
targeting the protein for degradation (25). Having found a decrease
in Cdc25A expression levels, we investigated whether acid exposure
activated the Chk pathways. Compared with non–acid-exposed
controls, acid exposure resulted in no change in levels of total
Chk1, phospho–Chk1-s317 and phospho–Chk1-s345 at any time
point (Fig. 5). We also found that levels of total Chk2 did not seem
to differ from those of nonexposed controls at any time following
acid exposure (Fig. 5). In contrast, phospho-Chk2 levels increased
substantially after acid exposure, with maximal expression detected
at 15 to 30 min (Fig. 5). These data show that acid activates the
Chk2 checkpoint kinase, suggesting that the Chk2 pathway may be
involved in the early acid-induced delay in progression through the
G1-S checkpoint in BAR-T cells.
Inhibition of the Chk2 pathway prevents the early delay in
cell cycle progression following acid exposure. We used
caffeine, an inhibitor of the ATM/ATR kinases immediately
upstream of Chk2, to determine whether the delay in cell cycle
progression induced by acid exposure is dependent on this
checkpoint kinase cascade. In preliminary dose response experiments, we determined that 10 mmol/L caffeine prevented acidinduced phosphorylation of Chk2 kinase (Fig. 6A). BAR-T cells were
released into growth media for 14 h and then exposed to acid for 10
min in the presence and absence of 10 mmol/L caffeine; flow
cytometry was used to analyze movement into the S phase at 2 and
4 h after acid exposure. In the absence of caffeine, acid significantly
decreased the fraction of cells in the S phase compared with non–
acid-exposed controls (Fig. 6C, top). In caffeine-treated cells, there

www.aacrjournals.org

was no difference in the fraction of cells in the S phase between
acid-exposed and nonexposed cells at 2 h (Fig. 6C, top). Treatment
with caffeine did not prevent the acid-induced decrease in the
fraction of cells in the S phase at 4 h, however (Fig. 6C, top).
We next confirmed our findings by transfecting the BAR-T cells
with Chk2 siRNA oligonucleotides. To determine the efficiency of
Chk2 siRNA for inhibiting Chk2 expression, Western blotting was
done. As expected, we found a marked decrease in Chk2 expression
following transfection with the siRNA compared with transfection
with a control siRNA (Fig. 6B). We found that Chk2 siRNA
prevented the acid-induced decrease in the fraction of cells in S
phase at 2 h compared with acid-exposed cells transfected with the
control siRNA (Fig. 6C, bottom). Transfection with Chk2 siRNA did
not prevent the acid-induced decrease in the fraction of cells in S
phase at 4 h, however (Fig. 6C, bottom). These data suggest that
Chk2 activation mediates the early (2-h) acid-induced delay in
movement from G1 into S phase of the cell cycle, whereas the later
(4-h) delay in progression through this checkpoint is independent
of Chk2.

Discussion
In contrast to esophageal adenocarcinoma cells in which acid
exerts pro-proliferative effects, in telomerase-immortalized, nonneoplastic BAR-T cells, we have found that acid causes a decrease
in cellular proliferation that is associated with the activation of the
p53 and Chk2 pathways and with alterations in the levels and
activities of proteins that regulate the G1-S cell cycle checkpoint.
We have also shown that the early, antiproliferative effects of acid
are mediated by the activation of the Chk2 pathway. Thus, benign
BAR-T cells, with their intact cell cycle checkpoint machinery,
respond quite differently than Barrett’s cancer cells, which
proliferate in response to acid exposure (7, 26, 27).
In an earlier study, we found that BAR-T cells that were subjected
to multiple 3-min acid exposures exhibited a significant decrease in
cell numbers at 24 h (9). In the present study, we found a similar

significant decrease in cell numbers for BAR-T cells after a single,
3- or 10-min exposure to acid. To determine whether this acidinduced decrease in cell number was unique only to the BAR-T cell
line, we used two additional telomerase-immortalized, metaplastic
Barrett’s cells lines that were established in our laboratory. A
similar decrease in cell number was observed in all three lines,
suggesting that the antiproliferative effect of acid is a common
property of non-neoplastic BAR-T cells.
We next explored whether the acid-induced decrease in cell
number was the result of a direct toxic effect of the acid, an
acid-triggered increase in apoptosis, or an acid-induced decrease
in cell proliferation. We found that acid exposure had no effect
on cell viability, and we observed no morphologic features of
apoptosis. Using the annexin V assay, however, we found a small
but statistically significant increase in the fraction of apoptotic
cells following a 10-min acid exposure. We have previously
shown that acid exposure times of up to 3 min do not induce
apoptosis in BAR-T cells (9). These findings are in contrast to
those in esophageal adenocarcinoma cells in which acid
exposure was found to induce antiapoptotic effects (7, 26).
Furthermore, our results suggest that the acid-induced decrease
in BAR-T cell numbers was not the result of either direct acid
toxicity or apoptosis. We did find that acid prolonged the
transition from the G1 into the S phase of the cell cycle, an
effect that could be detected as early as 2 h after the acid

determined by flow cytometry 2 and 4 h after the exposure. B, effect of acid

exposure. The G1-S cell cycle checkpoint is known to be highly
susceptible to influence by exogenous factors in the cellular
environment (10).
The tumor suppressor p53 and its downstream effector p21 are
proteins well known to regulate the transition from G1 to S. In
response to genotoxic stress, p53 protein becomes post-translationally modified, stabilized, and able to induce the transcription
of genes that can cause cell cycle delay, arrest, and apoptosis
(11). In earlier studies, we showed that BAR-T cells express
functional p53 and undergo apoptosis in response to UV-B
irradiation (9, 13). In the present study, we determined protein
expression levels of total p53, phopho-p53 Ser15 (the transcriptionally active form), and phospho-p53 Ser46 (the apoptotically
active form) in BAR-T cells following acid exposure. We found an
increase in total p53 and phospho-p53 Ser15, but not phosphop53 Ser46 over a 6-h time course. In accordance with the
observed increase in the transcriptionally active form of p53, we
also observed an increase in p21 expression. In human
glioblastoma cells, acidic conditions have been shown to increase
transcriptional activity of p53 that is accompanied by an increase
in p21 mRNA and protein expression (28). Therefore, it is likely
that the induction of p21 that we observed in our BAR-T cells
was due to enhanced transcriptional activity of p53 induced by
the acid exposure.
Cyclin D1–Cdk4 and cyclin E–Cdk2, the main cyclin-Cdk
complexes that regulate the G1-S checkpoint, are known to be
targets for inhibition by p21 (29). We found no apparent effect of
acid on cyclin D1–Cdk4 activity. In contrast, acid exposure caused
an immediate decrease in cyclin E–Cdk2 activity that reached its
lowest levels within 15 to 30 min. This decrease in cyclin E–Cdk2
activity occurred well before we detected any increase in p21
protein levels, suggesting that p21 was not mediating the early
acid-induced decrease in cyclin E–Cdk2 activity.
The p53-dependent arrest of cells at the G1-S checkpoint has
been called a delayed response because it is a multistep process
(involving protein modification, stabilization, accumulation, and
transcriptional activation of downstream effector proteins) that
can require several hours to exert its effects (10). In contrast, a
rapidly activated, p53-independent G1-S checkpoint pathway
involving the degradation of Cdc25A recently has been described
(17). Normally, Cdc25A removes an inhibitory phosphate group
from the Cdk2 kinase, thereby activating the cyclin E–Cdk2
complex and promoting cell cycle progression (11). We found that
acid exposure induced a rapid decline in Cdc25A expression levels
that corresponded with increased levels of Cdk2 phosphorylated at
its inhibitory sites (Thr14/Tyr15).
Cdc25A is targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation when
it is phosphorylated by Chk1 or Chk2 (10, 25). We determined
whether acid activated Chk1 and Chk2 in BAR-T cells by
performing Western blots for expression of the phosphorylated,
active forms of these kinases. We found that acid exposure
increased phosphorylation of Chk2, but not Chk1. To determine
whether the acid-induced delay in G1-S phase progression was
Chk2 dependent, we inhibited Chk2 using either a pharmacologic
inhibitor, caffeine, or a Chk2 siRNA construct and confirmed
inhibition by Western blotting. In contrast to control cells, in which
acid exposure caused a decrease in the fraction of cells in the S
phase at 2 h, Chk2-inhibited cells exhibited no such decrease at
2 h after acid exposure. However, Chk2 inhibition did not prevent
the acid-induced decrease in the fraction of cells in the S phase at
4 h. These observations suggest that the early antiproliferative

Acid Activates Chk2 in Barrett’s Cells

demonstrating increases in p-p53 Ser15, total
p53, and p21 protein, decreases in Cdc25A
protein, increases in phospho-Cdk2 expression,

effect of acid exposure in BAR-T cells is mediated by the activation
of Chk2, which results in a rapid loss of Cdc25A activity with failure
to activate Cdk2.
We have found that acid activates both the p53 and Chk2
pathways in BAR-T cells. Those pathways are well known to be
activated by DNA damage induced by agents such as UV light or
ionizing radiation (25). Our findings that acid exposure can trigger
those same pathways suggest that acid may be exerting direct
genotoxic effects. Acid has been shown to cause DNA damage
in Chinese hamster cells and in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells
(30–32). Biopsies of metaplastic Barrett’s epithelium exhibit high
levels of DNA strand breaks and oxidative injury, and cultures of
esophageal adenocarcinoma cells exposed to acid and bile acids
develop DNA injuries (33–37). We speculate that acid exposure may

also cause genotoxic damage in our BAR-T cells. Unlike cancer cells
that proliferate in response to acid, however, benign Barrett’s cells
have intact cell cycle checkpoint mechanisms (Chk2 and p53) that
are activated by acid-induced DNA damage to decrease cell
proliferation.
Our finding that acid exerts antiproliferative effects on BAR-T
cells has interesting clinical implications. In an effort to prevent
cancer for patients with Barrett’s esophagus, clinicians commonly
prescribe antisecretory medications in doses beyond those
required to heal the symptoms and endoscopic signs of reflux
esophagitis. This practice is based on the in vitro studies discussed
above and on clinical studies showing decreased proliferation
markers in esophageal biopsy specimens from patients with
Barrett’s esophagus who received aggressive antisecretory therapy

(38). In those clinical studies, it is not possible to determine
whether acid control decreased proliferation in Barrett’s epithelium
directly by removing an acid-triggered proliferation signal, or
indirectly, through the anti-inflammatory effects of healing reflux
esophagitis. Inflammation is well known to be a potent stimulus for
proliferation and carcinogenesis in a number of organs (39). In our
BAR-T cell cultures, we have found that acid exerts direct,
antiproliferative effects via the activation of the p53 and Chk2
pathways. In clinical studies, those potentially beneficial antiproliferative effects of acid may have been overshadowed by the
more potent antiproliferative effects of acid suppression in healing
the inflammation of reflux esophagitis.
Further studies elucidating the mechanisms by which acid
triggers the p53 and Chk2 pathways in BAR-T cells will be
important to help determine what is the optimal level of acid
suppression for patients with Barrett’s esophagus. If those
pathways are activated because acid causes DNA damage, then
aggressive acid-suppressive therapy, even to the point of
complete elimination of acid secretion, may be appropriate. If,
however, acid directly triggers antiproliferative pathways without
causing DNA damage, then it may be prudent to tailor antisecretory therapy to achieve a level of gastric acid suppression

secretion.
In conclusion, we have shown that acid exposure decreases cell
proliferation by delaying progression through the G1-S cell cycle
checkpoint in non-neoplastic BAR-T cells. Acid exposure rapidly
increases the expression of phospho-Chk2, decreases the levels and
activity of Cdc25A, and decreases cyclin E–Cdk2 activity. Hours
later, acid exposure results in increased levels and transcriptional
activation of p53 along with increased expression of p21. Moreover,
activation of Chk2 mediates the early but not the late acid-induced
delay in G1-S cell cycle progression in metaplastic Barrett’s cells.
These studies have elucidated mechanisms whereby acid can exert
disparate effects on proliferation in neoplastic and non-neoplastic
BAR-T cells.
