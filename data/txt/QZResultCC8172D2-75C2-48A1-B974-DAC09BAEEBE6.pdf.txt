Abstract

Author Manuscript

Tumour-initiating cells (TICs) are responsible for metastatic dissemination and clinical relapse in
a variety of cancers1,2. Analogies between TICs and normal tissue stem cells have led to the
notion that activation of the normal stem-cell program within a tissue serves as the major
mechanism for generating TICs3-7. Supporting this notion, we and others previously established
that the Slug EMT-TF (EMT-inducing transcription factor), a member of the Snail family, is a
master regulator of the gland-reconstituting activity of normal mammary stem cells (MaSCs), and
that forced expression of Slug in collaboration with Sox9 in breast cancer cells can efficiently
induce entrance into the TIC state8. However, these earlier studies focused on xenograft models
with cultured cell lines and involved ectopic expression of EMT-TFs, often at non-physiological
levels. Using genetically engineered knock-in reporter mouse lines, here we show that normal
gland-reconstituting MaSCs9-11 residing in the basal layer of the mammary epithelium and breast
TICs originating in the luminal layer exploit the paralogous EMT-TFs Slug and Snail respectively,
which induce in turn distinct EMT programs. Broadly, our findings suggest that the seemingly
similar stem-cell programs operating in TICs and normal stem cells of the corresponding normal
tissue are likely to differ significantly in their details.
To define the functions of endogenously encoded, physiologically regulated Snail family
EMT-TFs in breast cancer pathogenesis in vivo, we generated knock-in IRES (internal

ribosomal entry site)-YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) reporters for Slug and Snail (Fig. 1a,
b). These knock-in reporters faithfully reflected the expression of the endogenous genes
(Extended Data Fig. 1a, b), and enabled the isolation of Slug+ or Snail+ cells by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Extended Data Fig. 6e-h).
Using these reporters, we found that Slug was expressed at higher levels in the normal
MaSC-enriched basal mammary epithelial cells (MECs) compared to the stromal fibroblasts
surrounding the mammary ducts. In contrast, the EMT-TFs Snail, Twist and Zeb1 were
expressed in stromal fibroblasts but not in either basal or luminal MECs (Fig. 1c-e,
Extended Data Fig. 1c-f). In addition to the differential expression of EMT-TFs, the MaSCenriched basal MECs displayed intermediate expression levels of both epithelial and
mesenchymal markers (Fig. 1f, g, Extended Data Fig. 1g). Hence, Slug expression in the
normal basal MECs was associated with only a partial conversion to the mesenchymal state.

Given the differential expression patterns of Slug and Snail, we undertook to analyze their
expression during tumour development using the MMTV-PyMT transgenic model of
mammary tumour formation, which mirrors the multi-step progression of human breast
cancers beginning from hyperplastic lesions to high-grade carcinomas that spontaneously
metastasize to the lungs12. In the initially formed hyperplastic lesions, we noted a marked
reduction of Slug-YFP+ cells relative to normal mammary glands, contrary to the hypothesis
that activation of the Slug EMT-TF might be the preferred mechanism to generate TICs.
These Slug-YFP+ cells were cytokeratin14+ (CK14) (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 2f),
indicating Slug expression was still confined to cells of the basal lineage, as was the case
within the normal ducts. In these early-stage lesions, we detected for the first time SnailYFP expression in a small fraction of the neoplastic cells displaying CK8+Slug−Zeb1−
luminal characteristics (Fig. 2a, b, Extended Data Fig. 2a-c).
As these early-stage tumours progressed to high-grade carcinomas, the Slug+ cells remained
largely confined to the basal sectors of each epithelial island, whereas the Snail+ cancer cells
were sometimes fully detached from the epithelial islands and exhibited an elongated
mesenchymal morphology (Fig. 2c). We found that virtually all Snail-YFP+ tumour cells
had lost E-cadherin and activated expression of the Zeb1 EMT-TF; in contrast, the majority
of Slug-YFP+ tumour cells retained junctional E-cadherin and lacked Zeb1 expression (Fig.
2c, d, Extended Data Fig. 2d). Therefore, Snail rather than Slug is associated with more
complete expression of mesenchymal traits in mammary tumours.

Author Manuscript

Interestingly, as tumours progressed, we noted that the Snail-YFP+ cells gradually acquired
basal CK14 expression and lost luminal CK8 expression (Fig. 2e, Extended Data Fig. 2c, e),
echoing the proposal that in human breast carcinomas, aggressive cancer cells exhibiting
basal features can actually arise from luminal precursors13-17. To compare the activation of
Slug and Snail during such luminal-basal transitions, we utilized a organoid culture system,
in which CK14 is spontaneously activated as the tumour cells invade into a type I collagen
gel13. We dissociated adenocarcinomas into tumour organoids as previously described13.
These freshly isolated tumour organoids were almost exclusively of luminal phenotype
(CK8+CK14−) and lacked both Slug-YFP and Snail-YFP expression (Extended Data Fig.
3a). After 48h in culture, CK14 expression was induced in tumour cells at the invasive fronts

of these organoids. Strikingly, this induction was tightly associated with Snail-YFP but not
Slug-YFP activation (Fig. 2f, Extended Data Fig. 3b, c).
Taken together, these analyses indicate that the EMT-TF that is activated in the MMTVPyMT mammary tumours (i.e., Snail) is distinct from the one expressed in the normal glandreconstituting MaSCs (i.e., Slug); and that expression of Snail rather than its paralogue Slug
is associated with potent EMT activation and eventual acquisition of basal features
(Extended Data Fig. 3d).

Author Manuscript

To further extend and generalize these observations, we compared Slug, Snail and Zeb1
expression patterns in the MMTV-Neu18 and BRCA1/p53-minus19 transgenic models of
breast cancer development. Snail activation had previously been associated with recurrence
and metastasis formation in the MMTV-Neu model20,21. Consistently, we found that Snail
and Zeb1 are activated in ~1-2% of tumour cells within MMTVNeu tumours that are
associated with metastatic disease, which contained no evidence of Slug activation
(Extended Data Fig. 4a-c). The BRCA1/p53-minus tumours were highly heterogeneous and
harbored areas with epithelial and glandular phenotypes as well as areas with mesenchymal
and invasive phenotypes (Extended Data Fig. 4 d, g). We found that Slug was predominantly
expressed by cells occupying the basal sectors of the gland-like structures (echoing its
expression in normal ducts), whereas Snail and Zeb1 were predominantly expressed in the
invasive cells (Extended Data Fig. 4 d-h). Hence, differential expression of Slug and Snail
appears to be a conserved feature of mammary tumours driven by diverse oncogenic signals.

We were curious whether differential expression of SLUG and SNAIL was also observable
in human breast cancer cells and therefore surveyed SLUG versus SNAIL expression in
human breast cancer cell lines. Mirroring our observations in the mouse models, SNAIL but
not SLUG was expressed in luminal breast cancer cells, and the two EMT-TFs were
expressed in distinct (but occasionally overlapping) populations in basal breast cancer cells
(Extended Data Fig. 5a, b). In addition to these genetically unrelated breast cancer cell lines,
we compared SLUG and SNAIL expression in an MCF10A-based model of breast cancer
progression22. This model consists of the immortalized, nontumourigenic MCF10A human
MECs, MCF10A cells transformed with an H-RAS oncogene (MCF10A-Ras), and a cell line
established from an MCF10A-Ras cell-derived carcinoma (MCF10A-Ras-C). We found that
SLUG was expressed in MCF10A cells, but was down-regulated in MCF10ARas-C cells. In
contrast, SNAIL was absent in MCF10A cells, but underwent activation in MCF10A-Ras
cells and further up-regulation in MCF10A-Ras-C cells (Extended Data Fig. 5c).

Author Manuscript

To summarize, these results indicated that the differential expression of Slug and Snail is a
common feature of mammary tumours despite their different subtypes, genetic backgrounds
and oncogenic drivers. Although Snail is absent in normal MECs, it often becomes activated
during breast cancer progression. Indeed, SNAIL expression was detected in ~80% microdissected human invasive ductal carcinomas23.
Our observations raised the question of whether the Slug+, Snail+, or yet other cell
subpopulations within mammary tumours were enriched in TICs. In order to address this
issue, we developed a system that allowed us to isolate these various subpopulations. Thus,

we FACS-purified premalignant EpCAM+ MECs from 4-5 week old SlugYFP/+;MMTVPyMT;RFP (red fluorescent protein) or SnailYFP/+;MMTV-PyMT;RFP animals, and
thereafter implanted these cells into cleared mammary fat pads of hosts that lacked these
transgenes (Fig. 3a). The implanted premalignant MECs first grew as rudimentary ductal
structures and then progressed over 6-7 months to form high-grade carcinomas that
metastasized to the lungs (Extended Data Fig. 6a, b).

Author Manuscript

We FACS-resolved the RFP+ carcinoma cells based on the expression levels of the YFP
(Slug or Snail) reporter and the EpCAM epithelial marker. In the high-grade carcinomas and
corresponding pulmonary metastases, EpCAM expression was down regulated in 4-12% of
the carcinoma cells. These EpCAMlo cells had low Slug-YFP expression (Fig. 3b, Extended
Data Fig. 5c) but high Snail-YFP expression (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 5d). In contrast,
the EpCAMhi populations were Snail-YFPlo (Fig. 3c), and were composed of SlugYFPloEpCAMhi and Slug-YFPhiEpCAMhi subpopulations (Fig. 3b). Hence, EpCAM
expression was inversely correlated only with Snail expression.
Using qRT-PCR analyses, we confirmed that Snail expression was highest in the EpCAMlo
subpopulations, whereas Slug was enriched in EpCAMhi subpopulations (Fig. 3d, e). As
expected, strong induction of mesenchymal markers and suppression of E-cadherin was
only seen in the EpCAMlo subpopulations (Fig. 3d, e). Using cell lines derived from
SlugYFP/+;MMTV-PyMT and SnailYFP/+;MMTV-PyMT tumours, we also observed the
segregation of Slug and Snail expression at the protein level and associated Snail but not
Slug expression with strong induction of a mesenchymal phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 6eh).

Together, these observations demonstrated our ability to resolve and isolate distinct tumour
cell subpopulations with high levels of either Slug (Slughigh) or Snail (Snailhigh) from the
same primary tumours (Extended Data Fig. 7a), allowing us, in turn, to directly compare
their respective tumour-initiating activities. To this end, we FACS-purified these
subpopulations (Extended Data Fig. 6e-h) and implanted each at limiting dilutions to score
tumour formation. Overall, Snailhigh subpopulations exhibited more than two orders-ofmagnitude higher proportions of TICs than did the other subpopulations. In contrast, the
Slug-YFPhigh cells were as deficient in tumour-initiating ability as the Slug-YFPloEpCAMhi
cells (Extended Data Fig. 7b, c). Hence, Snail but not Slug was tightly associated with a TIC
phenotype.

Author Manuscript

To compare the TIC activities and metastatic powers of these tumour cell subpopulations
coexisting in the same primary tumours in vivo, we FACS-purified each subpopulation from
highly metastatic carcinomas generated by SlugYFP;MMTV-PyMT;RFP cells and introduced
them via the tail vein to gauge their respective abilities to seed pulmonary metastases.
Strikingly, the Snailhigh cells consistently gave rise to far more metastatic outgrowths
relative to the EpCAMhi subpopulations. In particular, 40,000 Snailhigh cells from a highly
metastatic primary tumour (Extended Data Fig. 8a) seeded on average ~90 large metastases
in each animal. In stark contrast, 40,000 cells of the Slughigh, and Slug-YFPloEpCAMhi
subpopulations from the same tumour seeded an average of only 3.6 and 2.2 metastases per
animal respectively (Fig. 3f, Extended Data Fig. 8b). The Snailhigh cells were also far more

metastatic than the other two populations when implanted subcutaneously (Fig. 3g,
Extended Data Fig. 8e-g). Interestingly, the metastatic outgrowths formed by the Snailhigh
cells harbored gland-like structures composed of both Slug+ and Slug− cells (Extended Data
Fig. 8c, d). Hence, the Snailhigh cells that seeded metastases were capable of differentiating
within these outgrowths, thereby regenerating the complex cellular hierarchy present in the
original primary tumours. These data also revealed that the TICs did not derive from basal
MaSC-like cells (i.e. the Slughigh cells) but instead arose in a different cell population.
We were curious whether correlates of these distinct behaviors of SLUG and SNAIL could
be found in human clinical datasets and therefore examined the prognostic powers of SLUG
or SNAIL24. Across various patient populations, we found that only elevated expression of
SNAIL consistently associated with poor survival (Extended Data Fig. 9a).

These above results strongly argue for divergent roles of Slug and Snail, and predicted that
shutdown of Snail could selectively eliminate breast TICs. To test this notion, we knocked
down either Slug or Snail in advanced MMTV-PyMT carcinoma-derived pBl.3G cells and
MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells (Extended Data Fig. 9b, c). Strikingly, Snail
knockdown but not Slug knockdown induced mesenchymal-toepithelial transition (MET),
leading to loss of Zeb1 and reactivation of E-cadherin (Fig. 4a, b). When these cells were
injected orthotopically into mammary fat pads, Snail but not Slug knockdown attenuated
primary tumour growth and strongly suppressed their metastatic spreading (Fig. 4c-e).
Similarly, across a panel of human breast cancer cell lines, we found that SNAIL
knockdown significantly suppressed tumour-initiation in most of them, while SLUG
knockdown failed to do so (Extended Data Fig. 9d-f). In sharp contrast to the responses of
breast cancer cells, the organoid-forming and gland-reconstituting activities of normal
murine MaSCs were dramatically affected by Slug knockdown but not by Snail knockdown
(Fig. 4f, Extended Data Fig. 9g).

Given the distinct functions exerted by Slug and Snail, we analyzed the transcription
programs controlled by these paralogous EMT-TFs using ChIP-seq. We focused on two
MMTV-PyMT tumour cell lines, which differed in Slug and Snail expression and
tumorigenic potential (Extended Data Fig. 10a, b). We recovered similar numbers of
chromatin regions that were enriched for either Slug or Snail binding (Fig. 5a). Across the
genome, Slug- and Snail-binding sites displayed similar fold enrichments and were both
enriched for the known Snail family recognition CANNTG E-box motif25 (Extended Data
Fig. 10c, d). We found that Snail occupied 10,129 promoters, far more than that occupied by
Slug (2,475 promoters) (Fig. 5b). Interestingly, the promoters of genes encoding key
mesenchymal markers were only bound by Snail but not by Slug (Extended Data Fig. 10e).
Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) confirmed that Snail-bound but not Slug-bound genes
were significantly enriched for EMT-related signatures (Fig. 5c). In particular, Snail, but not
Slug, occupied the promoter of Zeb1 (Fig. 5d), a master regulator of TICs under a variety of
settings26-28. The binding of Snail appears to activate Zeb1 expression in mammary tumour
cells, because knockdown of Snail led to down-regulation of Zeb1 (Fig. 4a, c), and ectopic
expression of Snail in human MECs induced Zeb1 expression (Extended Data Fig. 10f).
Indeed, Snail had been reported to activate Zeb1 expression in non-mammary types of
epithelial cells29,30.

To investigate the possible differential abilities of SLUG and SNAIL in controlling ZEB1
expression in human breast cancer cells, we used ChIP-qPCR to examine SLUG and SNAIL
binding at the ZEB1 promoter in MDA-MB-231 cells, which happen to co-express SLUG
and SNAIL. Strikingly, although both SLUG and SNAIL appeared to co-occupy the ZEB1
promoter in these cells, SLUG binding (but not SLUG expression) was diminished in
SNAIL knockdown cells (Fig. 5e-g). Since the knockdown of SNAIL, but not SLUG,
resulted in down-regulation of ZEB1 in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4c) and the binding of
SLUG to the ZEB1 promoter is dependent on SNAIL expression, we concluded that ZEB1
expression was controlled by SNAIL but not SLUG in MDA-MB-231 cells as well.

In summary, our data underscore profound differences in the transcription-regulating
activities of the endogenously encoded Slug and Snail EMT-TFs, and provide indications
that normal SCs and TICs of the same tissue-of-origin could arise from different cellular
compartments and exploit different molecular signaling circuits to activate related but
distinct signaling pathways. We have previously correlated high levels of SLUG expression
with poor prognosis in human breast cancer patients, and attributed such correlation to the
experimentally observed EMT-inducing function of SLUG8. However, on the basis of the
present work, we propose that the prognostic power of SLUG expression may be due in
large part to its strong association with basal differentiation, which is, on its own, a wellknown feature of aggressive breast cancers16. Nonetheless, since our in vivo analyses
focused on MMTV promoter-driven tumours, which appear to derive primarily from luminal
MECs, we suggest that the functions of Slug in basal MEC-derived tumours remain to be
further characterized.

Tumour categorization

Author Manuscript

MMTV-PyMT tumours were categorized into hyperplastic lesions, adenocarcinomas and
high-grade carcinomas following the histological criteria described by Lin et al12. Briefly, in
the genetic background of our animals, hyperplasic lesions usually occur at about 8-10
weeks of age, and consist of regionally packed lobules formed on the duct. We collectively
refer to the Adenoma/MIN and early carcinoma stages defined by Lin et al as
adenocarcinomas, as the tumours from 2.5 to 4 months old animals often have mixed
characteristics of both kinds. High-grade carcinoma corresponds to the Late Carcinoma/
Advanced Invasive Carcinoma as defined by Lin et al, and is always associated with
metastatic disease.

and digested with collagenase A followed by trypLE-select (invitrogen). The dissociated
tumour cells were then washed twice with DMEM with 10% FBS, and filtered through 70

To establish tumour cell lines, 1×107 dissociated and filtered tumour cells were plated in a
10 cm dish in DMEM: F12 supplemented with 5% adult bovine serum, non-essential amino
acids (Invitrogen), and penicillin/streptomycin. On the next day, dead cells were removed by
medium change, and the attached cells were passaged at 1:2 to 1:3 for about five passages
until each culture was established. Tumour cell lines were all derived from high-grade
carcinomas of 6-7 months old females.

endogenous mammary epithelium were cleared at the time of the injection. For tail-vein
injection, tumour cells were resuspended in 100 μl PBS, and injected into male animals. The
lungs were examined 4 to 8 weeks post injection. For subcutaneous injections, tumour cells
were suspended in 100 μl PBS with or without Matrigel (as indicated in the figures) into the

Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing

Author Manuscript

ChIP assay was carried out as described previously31. The ChIP-seq results have been
deposited to Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE61198. We
performed ChIP-seq experiments using either an anti-Slug or anti-Snail antibody. In the
Slug-high pBl.1G cells, as anticipated, we could only recover chromatin fragments from
Slug ChIP but not Snail ChIP. Conversely, from the Snail-high pBl.3G cells, chromatin
fragments were only recoverable from Snail ChIP but not Slug ChIP, demonstrating the
specificities of these antibodies. Slug- or Snail-bound DNA sites were determined with
Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) algorithm, and bound target genes were
defined as containing Slug or Snail occupancy within 5 kb upstream and downstream
relative to the transcription start site for each RefSeq transcript35. Fold enrichment of each
MACS peak were calculated against the whole cell extract. Enriched motifs were identified
using 1000nt centered at the peak summit of the top 1000 Slug and Snail peaks (ranked by
MACS peak scores). The sequences were processed through MemeChIP (http://
meme.nbcr.net/meme/cgi-bin/meme-chip.cgi) using default settings.
Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) were performed with the GSEA platform of Broad
Institute (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp). Slug-bound genes and Snail-bound
genes were ranked according to the fold enrichment of the correspondent MACS peaks.

For SLUG and SNAIL ChIP-qPCR in MDA-MB-231 cells, ChIP-enriched DNA was
analyzed by realtime PCR using the ABI PRISM 7900 sequence detection system and
SYBR green master mix. Relative occupancy values were calculated by determining the
apparent immunoprecipitation efficiency (ratios of the amount of immunoprecipitated DNA
to that of the input sample) and normalized to the level observed. The primers used for the
realtime PCR are ZEB1 target locus fwd ACAAGCGAGAGGATCATGGCG, rev
CACTCACCGTTATTGCGCCG; ZEB1 control locus fwd
TAATAATGGGCGGCAACGGC, rev AGGAACCAAAGCGAGCCCCT.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out by two-tailed Student's t-test unless otherwise specified.
