Abstract
In ovarian cancer, metastasis is typically conﬁned to the
peritoneum. Surgical removal of the primary tumor and macroscopic secondary tumors is a common practice, but more
effective strategies are needed to target microscopic spheroids
persisting in the peritoneal ﬂuid after debulking surgery. To
treat this residual disease, therapeutic agents can be administered by either intravenous or intraperitoneal infusion. Here,
we describe the use of a cellular Potts model to compare
tumor penetration of two classes of drugs (cisplatin and
pertuzumab) when delivered by these two alternative routes.
The model considers the primary route when the drug is
administered either intravenously or intraperitoneally, as well
as the subsequent exchange into the other delivery volume as a
secondary route. By accounting for these dynamics, the model

Major Findings
Mathematical modeling indicates that the most effective
therapeutic route for targeting avascular and microscopic
vascular ovarian tumors following debulking is likely to be
peritoneal delivery. As secondary tumor volume expands, the
use of both delivery routes is optimal to reach both avascular
tumor spheroids common in ascites settings as well as neovascularized tumors attached to peritoneal organs.

revealed that intraperitoneal infusion is the markedly superior
route for delivery of both small-molecule and antibody therapies into microscopic, avascular tumors typical of patients
with ascites. Small tumors attached to peritoneal organs, with
vascularity ranging from 2% to 10%, also show enhanced drug
delivery via the intraperitoneal route, even though tumor
vessels can act as sinks during the dissemination of small
molecules. Furthermore, we assessed the ability of the antibody to enter the tumor by in silico and in vivo methods and
suggest that optimization of antibody delivery is an important
criterion underlying the efﬁcacy of these and other biologics.
The use of both delivery routes may provide the best total
coverage of tumors, depending on their size and vascularity.

Introduction
Ovarian cancer is the seventeenth most common and twelfth
most deadly cancer in the United States (6). Because it is largely
asymptomatic during the early stages of disease, 61% of patients
present with cancer already disseminated throughout the abdominal cavity. As a consequence of late-stage diagnosis, the 5-year
survival rate is only 44% (7). Intraperitoneal administration of
cisplatin has been shown to correlate with improved overall
survival with the greatest survival effect seen in patients surgically
debulked to no gross residual disease (8–10). Combined intravenous/intraperitoneal chemotherapy has been recommended by
the NCI (Bethesda, MD) as the standard-of-care for optimally
debulked, FIGO stage III ovarian cancer patients (11). In this
study, we explore the effectiveness of intraperitoneal versus intravenous therapy for residual disease as a function of tumor attachment and vascularity. We predict that improved outcomes may
result from pathologic assessment of peritoneal tumor characteristics after cytoreduction, potentially leading to individualized
decisions on the routes of drug administration. We tested this
hypothesis using a hybrid agent–based computational model to
simulate delivery of both small-molecule and antibody therapies.
Disseminated ovarian tumors often exist as two distinct types:
(i) avascular cell aggregates ("spheroids") that are loosely
attached to organs within the peritoneal cavity or free ﬂoating
in the ascites ﬂuid, and (ii) vascularized tumors colonizing
peritoneal organs. For optimal treatment, drugs must be effective
against both types of tumors. Furthermore, the route of drug
delivery will likely have an effect on tumor drug penetration,
binding, and accumulation. We focus here on strategies for the
postsurgery treatment of microscopic residual tumors, where
debulking has removed both the primary tumor and larger
secondary tumors (>1 cm in diameter).

Intraperitoneal versus Intravenous Drug Delivery for Ovarian Cancer

Quick Guide to Model and Major Assumptions
We assume that during the time scale of drug penetration (2–9 hours), cancer cells neither grow nor migrate. This is a reasonable
assumption as in vitro studies suggest that ovarian cancer cells grown as spheroids have a reduced proliferation rate (1). Each cell is
considered a single agent, occupying one voxel on a 3-dimensional lattice in the CompuCell3D simulation environment. Chemical
dynamics are described in the following reaction–diffusion equation:
qC1
¼ DC1 r2 C1  gC1 þ a1 ½1  dðtðSÞ; vesselÞ  z1 ½1  dðtðSÞ; tumor Þ;
qt

ðAÞ

where C1 is the chemical concentration, DC1 is the effective diffusion coefﬁcient, g 1 is the decay rate, a1 is the chemical output at the
vessel, d is the Kronecker delta function that equals 0 when its variables are the same and equals 1 when they differ, S is the cell ID, t is
the cell type, and z1 is the chemical uptake by the tumor cells. We use a forward Euler method to solve this diffusion equation.
For drug concentrations in blood plasma and peritoneal ﬂuid at each time step, we use constant concentrations determined by ﬁts to
patient data and rat data (Supplementary Table S1). Vessel voxels are reset to a new constant concentration at each time step;
therefore, only voxels comprising the vessel surface contribute drug to nonvessel neighbor voxels, as in real vessels. Peritoneal ﬂuid
voxels are treated similarly. After intravenous delivery, small-molecule drug has the same concentration at the vessel surface as in the
plasma. In contrast, antibody concentration at the vessel surface is inhibited by the vascular wall, and concentration at the vessel
surface is described by
CVesselSurface ðtÞ ¼ CPlasma ðtÞ  B;

ðBÞ

where CPlasma(t) and CVesselSurface(t) is the concentration in blood and at the vessel surface, respectively, and B is the Biot number. The
Biot number is the ratio of capillary extravasation to the free diffusion coefﬁcient in tumor tissue, an approach pioneered by Thurber
and colleagues (2–4) to quantify passage of proteins across the vascular wall as the rate-limiting step of delivery.
Our simulation environment represents small tumors of approximately 30 cells in diameter with a total of 13,997 cells. Tumors of
this size should be well oxygenated with no necrotic core (5). The spherical tumor surface is completely exposed to ﬂuid, a similar
conﬁguration to tumors suspended in peritoneal ﬂuid or attached to the mesentery. Drug is delivered simultaneously from tumor
vessels and the peritoneal cavity. Simulation volume is 33  33  33 voxels. Voxels have a cube edge of 5.6 mm. The volume of each
voxel is equivalent to the volume of an SKOV3.ip1 cancer cell, or 179.4 mm3 (5). For each drug, we deﬁne each Monte Carlo step as
the time for molecules to diffuse the distance of one cell diameter, which is equivalent to 1/1207.183 minutes for cisplatin and 1/
25.011 minutes for pertuzumab. Each vascular tumor contains a simulated vascular meshwork generated in Matlab by randomly
placing unconnected cylinders of speciﬁed radii and lengths drawn from distributions corresponding to experimental observations.

Drug Modeling Assumptions
We consider only the primary rate-limiting step for drug diffusion in tumor tissue as determined by the molecular weight, shape,
and lipophilicity of a drug (4). In the model, for low molecular weight cisplatin, we assume no explicit barriers within blood or
tissue. For large molecular weight, cell-binding antibody, we consider the penetration from the intraperitoneal ﬂuid into tumor
tissues as a passive process, and we parameterize it from our own ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements.
We consider drug distributions in two compartments, the blood (intravenous) and the peritoneal ﬂuid (intraperitoneal). The
primary delivery compartment is the ﬁrst compartment into which drug is injected (either intravenously or intraperitoneally); the
secondary compartment receives a wave of drug during distribution throughout the body. We ﬁt drug concentrations as polynomial
functions of time. All cisplatin compartment concentrations and pertuzumab primary compartment concentrations are ﬁtted using
patient data from the literature. Because we do not have simultaneous intraperitoneal and intravenous data for pertuzumab in
patients, we use intraperitoneal/intravenous and intravenous/intraperitoneal ratios from antibodies delivered intravenously and
intraperitoneally to rats (see Supplementary Table S1). We apply those ratios to patient data for primary intraperitoneal or
intravenous delivery, assuming that ratios of drug in the secondary compartment to the primary compartment are doseindependent. Secondary compartment pertuzumab concentrations are calculated as the current concentration in the primary
compartment times the ratio of the current concentration in the secondary compartment to that in the primary compartment.
Explicit equations of primary and secondary ﬁts are provided in Supplementary Table S1. Primary and secondary concentrations
are set as constant concentrations in the compartment ﬂuids for the duration of the time step, creating constant boundary conditions
for the vessels and tumor surface.

Drug movement between the peritoneal and the blood plasma
compartments is a key feature of the pharmacokinetics affecting
abdominal tumors. In healthy individuals, the volume of peritoneal ﬂuid is small (10–30 mL). This ﬂuid resides in the inter-

www.aacrjournals.org

stitial spaces and is secreted by mesothelial cells (reviewed in 12).
The ﬂuid circulates through the cavity and enters the blood
circulation via adjunct capillaries (40%–50%) or stomata on
the underside of the diaphragm. The stomata can admit particles

up to 25 mm in diameter into the diaphragmatic lymphatics,
which connect to the greater lymphatic system. Fluid ultimately
drains back into the venous circulation. Because the blood and
intraperitoneal compartments are intimately connected, our
model accounts for the initial drug infusion into the primary
peritoneal or blood compartment as well as the delayed appearance of drug in the secondary compartment.
Mathematical modeling of drug delivery was pioneered in
the 1960s and has progressed to current models that incorporate tumor-induced angiogenesis (13, 14). Recent reviews
have summarized current strategies used to model anticancer
drug penetration at different temporal and spatial scales
(15, 16). Frieboes and colleagues incorporated experimental
data into their 3-dimensional computational model of lymphoma growth (17) and have also modeled nanoparticle
delivery and accumulation in developing tumors (18). Of
particular note, Sinek and colleagues created a 2-dimensional
multiscale model of cisplatin and doxorubicin intravascular
delivery (19). For ovarian cancer, previous mathematical
models have addressed the penetration of doxorubicin
through multiple cell layers (20) the effectiveness of new or
established treatments (21) and predicted survival rates of
patients after surgery or drug treatment (22). The metabolic
and spatial characteristics of ovarian cancer cell spheroids
have also been considered (23).

1322 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

Few spatially explicit models of ovarian cancer exist aside from
our own (5). Giverso and colleagues built a 2-dimensional
cellular Potts model of ovarian cancer that explores the interaction
of ovarian cancer cells with the mesothelial layer and underlying
extracellular matrix during invasion (24). El-Kareh and colleagues
modeled the penetration distance of cisplatin into the rat peritoneum with and without hyperthermia (25). This model and
others, as well as experimental measures for penetration into
tissues in the peritoneal cavity, suggest absorption of smallmolecule drugs by vessels can be a barrier to drug delivery (2).
Here, we report results of a 3-dimensional spatial model of drug
delivery using OvTM, our ovarian tumor model (5) parameterized
for ovarian tumor spheroids in the peritoneum. OvTM was based
on the cellular Potts model using the CompuCell3D simulation
environment (26). We extend the OvTM to study drug dynamics
for two delivery compartments, the blood and peritoneal ﬂuid,
respectively. Results show that, for avascular spheroids and small,
vascularized tumors in the process of seeding peritoneal organs,
the intraperitoneal route is superior for drug delivery.

SKOV3.ip cell line was authenticated in November 2014 by ATCC
using short tandem repeat (STR) analysis by the Wandinger-Ness
lab. For spheroid assays, 2,000 SKOV3.ip-GFP cells were seeded
into each well of a Lipidure-coated 96-well plate (NOF America
Corporation) and incubated for 48 hours to allow the formation
of spheroids. Pertuzumab (Perjeta, Genentech) was purchased
from the UNM Pharmacy and conjugated to Paciﬁc Blue 410 or
Alexa Fluor 488 succinimidyl ester dyes per the manufacturer's
guidelines (Life Technologies). Spheroids were incubated in ﬂuorescently conjugated pertuzumab at a ﬁnal concentration of 3.5
mg/mL and imaged on a Zeiss 510 confocal microscope with a
META detector. For FRAP analysis, spheroids were incubated for 1
hour with 350 mg/mL nonbinding Alexa488-labeled IgG to allow
complete penetration by diffusion. Images were collected on a
Zeiss Axiovert 200M META using an LD LCI Plan-Neoﬂuar 25
objective. A 14-mm circular region of interest was photobleached
using an Argon laser at full power with maximum pinhole. Images
were corrected for background ﬂuorescence and for photobleaching during acquisition. Fluorescence recovery over time was
plotted and ﬁt to a single exponential to determine the recovery
half-time. The diffusion coefﬁcient was estimated as shown by
Axelrod and colleagues (27). Average values were obtained from
analyzing a total of 34 regions of interest from two separate

delineating the tumor area were drawn using Stereo Investigator
software. Vessel area density within these tumor regions was
calculated using the Stereo Investigator Area Fraction Fractionator
Probe. Each tumor contour was systematically, randomly sampled with a rectangular region (counting frame) containing a
lattice of grid points. Grid points were spaced 10 mm apart. A grid
point was marked as vessel if the triangle deﬁned by the upper
right-hand quadrant of the grid point "cross-hair" contained
pixels darkly stained for CD31. Structure of the overall tissue and
relative darkness of stain were taken into account in marking
CD31-labeled points. Counting frame size and spacing varied
from tumor to tumor to mark enough points to obtain good vessel
area density estimates (at least 200 points/contour). Stereo Investigator software estimated the fractional area of each tumor
covered by CD31-labeled vessels using the number of marked
grid points, the size of the sampled area, and the total area of the
tumor contour. Vessel diameter was calculated using Stereo
Investigator Line Measure or Circle Measure tools. Each tumor
section was divided roughly into quadrants, and 3 to 5 vessels
were measured per quadrant, with multiple vessels (10–20)
chosen per tumor (236 vessels measured in 18 tumors).

Results
Schematic of the modeling approach
The integration of experimental and modeling results is
outlined in Fig. 1. A critical aspect of our OvTM model is that,
once drugs are administered by the intravenous or intraperitoneal route, there is transient delivery to the other compartment. Drug exchange between the two compartments is based
on published studies as described in Supplementary Data. Fits
for drug concentrations in the primary and secondary compartments over time, which are used as parameters in our model,
are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Time courses of drug
exchange used in the model are plotted in the pharmacokinetics
box (Fig. 1). The model also explicitly integrates experimentally
measured levels of tumor vascularity, with values discretized to
ﬁt voxel dimensions. Parameters for penetration, binding, and
cellular accumulation are listed in Table 1. Further explanation
of model assumptions can be found in the Supplementary
Material.
In vitro spheroids serve as a model for drug penetration in
avascular tumors
In Fig. 2, we ﬁrst experimentally evaluate drug delivery to
avascular, 3-dimensional cancer cell aggregates by passive penetration. SKOV3.ip1 ovarian cancer cells were grown as spheroids
(2,000 cells), incubated for deﬁned intervals with ﬂuorescent
small molecules or antibodies and then imaged by confocal
microscopy. Naturally, ﬂuorescent doxorubicin (MW 543 Da)
was used to represent the class of low molecular weight, highly
lipophilic chemotherapeutic compounds; it is used here as a
surrogate for the behavior of cisplatin (MW 300 Da), a ﬁrst-line
therapy for ovarian cancer. Results for doxorubicin are shown
in Fig. 2A, where the ﬂuorescence intensity plot below the 10minute image shows the drug well distributed across the spheroid.
Note that the ﬂuorescence intensity continued to rise over the
incubation period of 90 minutes, attributed to drug accumulation
in cell nuclei as doxorubicin intercalated into DNA. The data are
consistent with the fast penetration of small–molecular weight
drugs in tumors (28). These results validate the use of a fast

1324 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

diffusion rate for cisplatin (640 mm2/second; ref. 29) in our
simulations.
We next experimentally evaluated the uptake of therapeutic
antibodies into cultured spheroids. The passive diffusion coefﬁcient for these large proteins (150 kDa) was estimated by
FRAP). The spheroids were incubated with ﬂuorescently tagged,
nonbinding IgG for 1 hour. As shown in Fig. 2B, this is a
sufﬁcient period for the IgG to diffuse through the intercellular
spaces to the spheroid interior. A 28-mm diameter spot was
photobleached, and diffusion of ﬂuorescent antibodies within
the interstitial space in the absence of binding was estimated
based upon ﬂuorescence recovery. As shown in Fig. 2C, an
estimated diffusion coefﬁcient of 4.5 mm2/second for nonspeciﬁc IgG was similar to that of control (70 kDa dextran; 4.8
mm2/second). We interpret this as evidence that the cell–cell
junctions in these spheroids are insufﬁcient barriers to strongly
limit protein penetration. Interestingly, average diffusion within in vitro spheroids was three times slower than estimates of in
vivo nonbinding antibody diffusion by Berk and colleagues,
indicating that other factors play an important role in vivo (30).
Next, the penetration of targeted antibody was evaluated by
incubating spheroids with subclinical levels (3.5 mg/mL) of Alexa
488-conjugated pertuzumab, which binds the ERBB2 receptor
and is abundantly expressed on the surface of SKOV3.ip1 cells.
Note that ERBB2 expression is a feature of only approximately
35% of ovarian tumors (31); it is reasonable to assume that our
results should apply to antibodies directed at other surface receptors on ovarian tumor cells, such as ERBB3 and MET (31). Images
in Fig. 2D and accompanying intensity plots show that there is a
"wave front" of antibody binding as it penetrates into the tumor
spheroid. Under these conditions, saturation of antibody binding
is not achieved within the center of the spheroids even following
an incubation period of 24 hours. The depth of ﬂuorescent
antibody penetration into spheroids was measured at each time
point and is plotted in Fig. 2E. On the basis of these data, the
effective penetration rate of antibodies with high afﬁnity for
tumor surface antigens is three orders of magnitude slower than
predicted based upon nonspeciﬁc antibody diffusion. One goal of
our model is to explore the relationship between binding rates,
antibody concentration, and tumor penetrance.
Incorporating vessel density from human ovarian tumors into
the mathematical model
Vascularization of tumors will also affect drug penetration.
The range of vascular densities was estimated based on the
analysis of disseminated ovarian tumors collected from 9
ovarian cancer patients. Formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded
sections from these tumors were labeled with anti-CD31
antibodies as a vascular endothelial cell marker. For each
patient, paired samples of omentum and bowel metastases
were evaluated to examine whether the site of metastasis
affected vascular density. Vascular density was measured and
reported as percent of total area analyzed (Fig. 3). Samples
from each site showed no statistical difference with respect to
distribution of vascular density, and there was no statistical
correlation between percent vascular areas at the two sites in
each patient (Supplementary Fig. S1). Mean percent vascular
area was 4.8% with SD of 2.47% and a 95% conﬁdence
interval from 3.57% to 6.03%. In our models, we consider
vascular areas of 2% and 10%, which represent the extremes of
observations from the 18 tumors. Supplementary Figure S2

Vascular density was measured in ovarian cancer patient metastases to parameterize simulations of vascularized tumors. A–F, four-micron sections of matched
bowel and omentum tumors from 9 ovarian cancer patients (UNM Human Tissue Repository) were labeled with anti-CD31 antibody (DAB, brown) to detect vascular
endothelial cells. Vascular density (% area) is reported at the bottom right of each image. Metastases showed within- and between-patient variability in
vascular density, with some patients having metastases with low vascular density (patient 7, A and B), some patients having tumor-dependent variability in vascular
density (patient 9, C and D), and other patients having tumors with uniformly high vascular density (patient 4, E and F). G, average vascular density is comparable in

As a ﬁrst step for integrating these values into our cellular

Intraperitoneal versus Intravenous Drug Delivery for Ovarian Cancer

cellular cytotoxicity to be approximately 5.6  106 cisplatin
molecules per cell (32). To reach this level, cultured cells were
exposed to 38 mmol/L cisplatin for 2 hours. Importantly, this
provides a target level of drug accumulation to be achieved in
our cell-based tumor model.
Simulation conditions began with infusion of cisplatin
by either route for 15 minutes (total 60 mg/m2), followed
by tracking of drug accumulation until cisplatin levels in
both compartments dropped to negligible levels (180
minutes). Figure 4A and B reports results for avascular spheroids with a 30 cell diameter (14,000 cells). Results show that,
for the same drug dose, the intraperitoneal route is clearly
superior. Direct infusion of cisplatin in the peritoneum at this
dose results in substantial and uniform drug levels across the
avascular tumor (Fig. 4A; plot at right), reaching a predicted
level of almost 5.7  106 molecules per cell.
In contrast, intravenous delivery of cisplatin is predicted to have
poor response. In this case, cisplatin reaches the avascular tumor
solely by secondary delivery to the peritoneal ﬂuid. Cellular
accumulation is very low (see plot to the right of Fig. 4B), with
estimated cisplatin accumulation peaking at approximately
42,000 cisplatin molecules per cell. There is again little cell–cell
variability in drug uptake in this avascular setting. Importantly,
cisplatin delivery to avascular tumors via the intravenous route
results in accumulation far below the IC50 value.
Cisplatin accumulation in tumor cells after intraperitoneal or
intravenous delivery is inﬂuenced by vascular density
We next report results for cisplatin accumulation in the same
tumor volume, but with vascular densities of either 2% or 10%.
Despite direct delivery of drug from the blood through vessels, the
intraperitoneal route is again superior for these small tumors (Fig.
4C–F). The cell-to-cell variability of cisplatin accumulation in
vascularized ovarian tumors is one of the most striking results of
these simulations. The uptake of drug is highly heterogeneous, as
indicated by the large spread around the mean values plotted in
each case. The marked spatial gradients in drug accumulation
particularly following intraperitoneal delivery to vascularized
tumors (Fig. 4C and E) is notable. As accompanying plots show,
accumulation across the tumor is much less uniform than for the
same size of avascular tumor (Fig. 4A). This result indicates that
vessels are a sink for drug when cisplatin is infused directly into the
peritoneum. The inverse relationship between the vascular density of the tumor and drug accumulation after intraperitoneal
delivery may be an unappreciated factor in chemotherapy
regimens.
As shown in Fig. 4D, intravenous drug delivery to the 2%
vascular tumor accumulates a median value (solid blue line) of
only approximately 40,000 molecules per cell. Accumulation can
reach a maximum of 140,000 molecules per cell in the cells
nearest the vessels (green shaded area). For the 10% vascular
tumor, these values reach a median of approximately 90,000
molecules per cell, with a range of 50,000 to 180,000. This
represents only a small improvement in delivery to the tumors
over the avascular tumor (compare plots in Fig. 4B and F).
Intraperitoneal delivery offers advantages for therapeutic
antibodies
Therapeutic antibodies have evolved as critical options for the
targeted treatment of cancer (33), motivating our inclusion of
these high–molecular weight biologics in our model. In vivo,

www.aacrjournals.org

passage of antibody across the vascular endothelium is a critical
step in intravenous delivery of antibody to the tumor. In the
model, this process is represented by the Biot value (see the Quick
Guide). Effectively, for normal vasculature, this translates to an
available pool of IgG that is only 2% of that inside the vessel. This
applies equally to circulating antibody that is introduced by
primary infusion or enters the blood by secondary exchange from
the peritoneum. Simulations described below use Biot numbers
reﬂecting both normal vasculature and "leaky" tumor vasculature.
Other important considerations include expression levels of target
receptors in the tumor tissue and the afﬁnity of the antibody.
SKOV3.ip1 cells express more than 2 million ERBB2/HER2 receptors per cell; the afﬁnity of pertuzumab for ERBB2 is 9.1 nmol/L
(Table 1).
Results in Fig. 5 show predictions from the model for clinically
relevant doses of pertuzumab (5 mg/kg), when administered by
either intraperitoneal (top) or intravenous (bottom) routes,
assuming normal vasculature. For the case of intraperitoneally
delivered antibody, simulation parameters were ﬁt to the data of
Pai and colleagues (34), where infusion of 1 L saline was followed
by a 50 mL injection of antibody and a second infusion of saline.
For the case of intravenously delivered antibody, parameters were
ﬁt to data in the FDA bulletin 125409, with an infusion period of 3
hours (35). Simulation results indicate the early appearance of a
wave front of antibody binding (red). Peritoneal delivery to both
the avascular tumor in Fig. 5A and the 2% vascular tumor in Fig.
5B results in a rapidly advancing front and saturation of receptors
within 0.4 hour. Note that the wave front is faster than experimental results in Fig. 1 with subclinical doses of antibody, as
expected for the higher clinical dose. For the 10% vascular tumor,
some heterogeneity is seen near the center of the tumor which is
attributed to physical barriers of vessels that block antibody
penetration within the tumor geometry. The median values for
each of these simulations are plotted at right.
As shown in Fig. 5D–F, simulation results for intravenous
infusion of antibody are particularly striking and highlight the
limitations of antibody transport across normal endothelium,
represented by the low Biot number (4). Under these stringent
conditions, there is a marked delay in antibody binding, with the
wave front initiating at the border of the spheroid. This indicates
that most of the antibody entering the tumor comes from the
intraperitoneal ﬂuid, having arrived there after exchange from
blood. Half-maximal saturation is seen many hours after intravenous introduction of drug. Even in the tumors with 2% and
10% vascularity, there is negligible contribution from antibody
entering the tissue via vessels. Plots to the right demonstrate that
vascularized tumors have much greater heterogeneity in antibody
binding.
As vessels in tumors are often described as "leaky" (36), we
considered it important to report results of simulations using
higher Biot values to reﬂect a greater range of drug transport out of
vessels within tumors (37, 38). For intravenous delivery of antibody, increasing the Biot number 3.6- (Biot, 0.08) or 8.9-fold
(Biot, 0.20) resulted in a proportional improvement in accumulation rate (Fig. 6A and B). With the highest Biot value, simulations predict that cells could be nearly saturated within 3.5 hours,
compared with less than6 hours with the transport conditions of
normal vasculature. As seen in the plots in Fig. 6A and B, leaky
vessels also reduce the heterogeneity in drug accumulation.
Images in Fig. 6C–F provide experimental validation of our
predictions that direct delivery of antibody to the peritoneum is

Intraperitoneal versus Intravenous Drug Delivery for Ovarian Cancer

the superior route. Here, we took advantage of our human
xenograft animal model. GFP-expressing SKOV3.ip1 cells were
injected intraperitoneally into nude mice. After 2 weeks of tumor
growth, ﬂuorescently tagged pertuzumab was injected either
intravenously or intraperitoneally, followed by humane sacriﬁce
of recipient mice at time points indicated. Tumors were excised
from the mesentery or omentum and imaged by two-photon
microscopy. As shown in Fig. 6C, intraperitoneal injection
resulted in a near uniform binding of antibody to ERBB2 on
tumor cells within 3 hours. In contrast, intravenous injection
resulted in variable levels of drug binding within the ﬁrst 3 hours
after administration (Fig. 6D). As shown in Fig. 6E, there was little
improvement in drug binding even at 24 hours after intravenous
delivery, particularly in tumors on the mesentery. At 72 hours after
intravenous injection, binding of tagged antibody to cells in the
tumor is markedly diminished, possibly due to internalization
and degradation. Antibody at the tumor periphery at late time
points after intravenous injection may be principally due to
delayed secondary delivery from the peritoneal compartment.
On the basis of the incomplete antibody penetration seen in vivo
after intravenous delivery, we conclude that drug transport across
tumor vessels in the SKOV3.ip1 xenograft model is close to that of
normal vasculature but acknowledge that this may be highly
variable among patients.

Discussion
Here, we use a spatially explicit model to represent the delivery
of soluble drug and antibody-based therapies to microscopic
ovarian tumors disseminated in the abdominal cavity (Fig. 1).
In silico models have been useful for predicting drug response in
ovarian cancer spheroids (23) and for examining the distribution
and uptake of therapeutic antibodies during treatment (39). We
incorporate pharmacokinetic parameters from in vitro studies
along with vascular densities derived from human patients to
help us understand how the interplay of drug dynamics at the
molecular, cellular, and tissue scales impacts delivery to tumor
cells. Our model is well integrated with experimental data,
including measurements in cultured spheroids and xenograft
models.
In our simulations, we chose to focus on treatment strategies
for microscopic residual disease after debulking surgery. Clinical evidence suggests a survival advantage for intraperitoneal
over intravenous chemotherapy in optimally debulked patients
with no remaining gross residual disease (R0) showing the
highest survival advantage (8, 9, 40, 41). However, there is still
reluctance in many hospitals to administer intraperitoneal
therapy, due to the expertise required to implant peritoneal
ports and to monitor for the potential complications of cytokine storms with intraperitoneal antibody delivery and other
toxicities. A recent study reports that less than half of eligible

patients receive intraperitoneal chemotherapy (40). In addition, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval cytoreductive surgery is gaining more popularity based on data
suggesting equivalent survival in patients with any visible
residual disease (42). Our model was able to assess the effect
of delivery route on drug penetration into tumors, showing
that the impact of the intraperitoneal route on efﬁcacy may
be underappreciated. Results emphasize the importance of
direct drug delivery to the peritoneum for superior penetration
into microscopic avascular tumors, which likely comprise the
majority of microscopic residual tumors in optimally debulked
patients. We show that the same dose of cisplatin delivered
intraperitoneally leads to uniformly higher accumulation within tumor cells. Although we do not include cell death in this
model, the platinum accumulation levels modeled throughout
a small tumor exceed accumulation levels determined in vitro
under incubation conditions at the IC50 concentration of
cisplatin established for cytotoxicity (32). Thus, the model
predicts highest efﬁciency killing after intraperitoneal cisplatin
treatment. Intravenous delivery leads to much less accumulation of cisplatin, with levels far below accumulation associated
with effective killing. Because drug must reach avascular
tumors from the peritoneal ﬂuid, intravenous delivery
increases the time it takes for the drug to enter the peritoneal
cavity. Intravenous delivery also limits the total concentration
of cisplatin achieved in the peritoneal cavity. Therefore, this
secondary delivery markedly reduces accumulation in tumor
cells.
Ovarian cancer cells also grow as vascularized tumors attached
to peritoneal organs, and our previous studies in the SKOV3.ip
xenograft model indicate that even small tumors (30–40 cells in
diameter) may be well vascularized. Therefore, we went on to test
how vascular density will alter drug penetration using our model.
As the tumor vascular densities were variable among patients and
between omentum and bowel tumors from the same patient
(Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2), we tested drug penetration in
tumors at the extremes of the vascular density range (2% and 10%
vascular density). Surprisingly, the advantage of intraperitoneal
delivery persists for small vascularized tumors. Even in tumors with
10% vascular density, intraperitoneal delivery improved the accumulation of cisplatin in small tumors by 100-fold (Fig. 4) providing
one explanation for improved survival after intraperitoneal treatment. This underscores the need for intraperitoneal chemotherapy
in cases where patients have been optimally debulked to R0. An
interesting ﬁnding from the simulations is that, as vascular density
of the tumor increases, the drug accumulation after intraperitoneal
delivery becomes much less uniform. After intraperitoneal delivery
of cisplatin, drug concentration in the vessels is always lower than
in the peritoneal ﬂuid. Therefore, the vessels act as a sink, absorbing
small molecular weight drugs and reducing cisplatin accumulation
in a small number of cells in proximity to the vessels. These cells

Figure 5.
Simulations of pertuzumab delivery to spheroids show that antibody binding exhibits "wave front" behavior when administered by either intravenous (IV) or
intraperitoneal (IP) route. Binding of antibody within 0.01 mm tumors (avascular, 2% or 10% vascular density) is compared with intraperitoneal and intravenous
delivery of 5 mg/kg pertuzumab. A–C, simulation results reporting pertuzumab accumulation in spheroids after intraperitoneal delivery. Because of fast
antibody penetration after intraperitoneal delivery, pertuzumab accumulation is shown for multiples of 4.2 minutes in a 0.8-hour simulation. D–F, simulation results
reporting pertuzumab accumulation after intravenous delivery (pertuzumab diluted in the blood volume, 5 L per patient). For simulations of intravenous
delivery where antibody penetration is slower, pertuzumab accumulation is shown over 9 hours. The simulations predict at least a 2-fold improvement with
intraperitoneal delivery over intravenous delivery. Plots on the right report the minimum/maximum (green area) and median (blue line) accumulation over time,
expressed as molecules of antibody (each binding two receptors) per cell.

could be those that survive therapy and lead to relapse. Taken
together, our model data strongly suggest that intraperitoneal
therapy has biologic advantages in eradicating microscopic residual
disease in the peritoneal cavity after complete cytoreductive surgery
and underscores the need for prompt treatment postoperatively
before residual cells and spheroids have an opportunity to establish
macroscopic implants.
Although patients initially respond well to platinum/taxol
regimens, many will relapse. Novel treatment strategies,
including therapeutic antibodies, are being considered to limit
recurrence (43). Previous trials with anti-EGFR and anti-ERBB2
antibodies had limited success (44). These disappointing
results may be due to two factors: (i) ineffective delivery and
(ii) poor stratiﬁcation of patients based upon receptor expression patterns. On the basis of IHC results for a tumor microarray representing 200 ovarian tumor patients, we recently
determined that only a limited subset of ovarian tumors
express signiﬁcant levels of either ERBB1/EGFR or ERBB2/
HER2 (31). The SKOV3.ip cell line used in our studies here
is an example of this ERBB2þ subset, as they express more than
2 million ERBB2 per cell. With this as a model system, we
examined the penetration of the anti-ERBB2 therapeutic antibody, pertuzumab, to determine whether the advantage of
intraperitoneal delivery extends to this class of therapies.
Antibodies, being larger molecules than chemotherapeutic
agents, have more limited exchange between compartments.
Simulations predicted a signiﬁcant difference in intraperitoneal
versus intravenous delivery, again attributed to lower penetration from the blood into tumors. Our results suggest that
intraperitoneal delivery, possibly in combination with delivery
through the intravenous route, will yield optimal results for
this class of therapeutics.
Computer simulations provide powerful tools to investigate
questions that cannot be answered with experiments alone. For
example, our model predicts the distribution of cisplatin and
pertuzumab accumulation with a spatial and temporal resolution that would be impractical to produce experimentally.
The model additionally allows us to consider hypothetical
tumor vascular densities and leakiness, which are difﬁcult
parameters to manipulate experimentally. Where possible, we
validate model predictions experimentally. In this model, we
made the assumption that the vasculature is spatially homogeneous throughout the tumor, with the cross-sectional density reﬂecting the 3-dimensional network density. We recognize that the model could be further reﬁned to include a
connected network of vessels with varying permeability and
greater vessel heterogeneity.
Because this study focused on early treatment time points, we
did not include cell proliferation or cell death in our model.
This is an acknowledged limitation of our model as, at later
time points, apoptosis of cancer cells will likely increase the
permeability of tumor tissue and inﬂuence drug penetration
(45). Future additions to the OvTM could include explicit
determination of pharmacodynamic outcomes such as tumor
cell proliferation, migration, and viability in response to drug
accumulation. For example, recent work by Powathil and
colleagues examined the effect of hypoxia and cell-cycle
dynamics on the efﬁcacy of chemotherapy (46). Tumor heterogeneity, as well as mutations and phenotypic changes that
occur over the course of treatment, could be included in the
model as data become available (47).

1332 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

Our model is a powerful predictive tool that can be used to test
optimal dosing of both small-molecule drugs and therapeutic
antibodies. The beneﬁts of peritoneal delivery likely applies to
antibodies now in the pharmaceutical pipeline or in clinical trials
that target other surface receptors more commonly expressed on
ovarian tumor cells. Examples include intact antibodies and
small-molecule inhibitors targeting ERBB3 and MET, as well as
antibody–toxin conjugates, where low doses may be required to
limit toxicity (48–50). In addition to new receptor targets, antibody afﬁnity, receptor expression levels, and vascular leakiness
will be factors in the success of the antibodies in the pipeline for
this disease. The OvTM model may be useful to predict outcomes
for patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer, offering a new
tool for optimizing personalized therapy decisions regarding drug
choice and mode of delivery. Continued integration of simulations and experiment would maximize impact on future clinical
practice.
