Retinoic Acid Enhances TRAIL-Induced Apoptosis in Cancer
Cells by Upregulating TRAIL Receptor 1 Expression
Latha Dhandapani, Ping Yue, Suresh S. Ramalingam, Fadlo R. Khuri, and Shi-Yong Sun

Abstract
Many human cancer cells are sensitive to killing by the proapoptotic ligand TNF-related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL), which is under study for cancer treatment in clinical trials. The TRAIL receptor (TRAIL-R1; also
known as death receptor 4) is a transmembrane receptor that mediates TRAIL-induced apoptosis in cancer cells.
In this study, we show that retinoids sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by upregulating
expression of TRAIL-R1. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) upregulated TRAIL-R1 expression in human cancer cells
at the transcriptional level. The ability of ATRA to activate TRAIL-R1 expression was inhibited by retinoic acid
receptor (RAR) antagonists or siRNAs, but augmented by several RAR agonists. In analyzing how ATRA induces
RAR-dependent transcriptional upregulation of TRAIL-R1, we identified 2 putative retinoic acid response
elements termed Pal-17 (a palindrome separated by 17 bases) and DR-11 (a direct repeat separated by 11 bases)
in the 50 -flanking region of TRAIL-R1 gene. Deletion of DR-11, but not Pal-17, abrogated the ability of ATRA to
stimulate TRAIL-R1 promoter activity. Consistent with this observation, RAR binding to DR-11, but not to Pal-17,
was detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay in ATRA-treated cells, arguing that DR-11 was
responsible for ATRA-mediated activation of the TRAIL-R1 gene. ATRA augmented TRAIL-induced apoptosis
of cancer cells, and this activity was attenuated by a blockade to upregulation of TRAIL-R1 expression. Taken
together, our findings establish that ATRA accentuates TRAIL-induced apoptosis, reveal a novel mechanism by
which retinoids modulate apoptosis, and suggest a novel strategy to augment the anti-cancer activity of TRAIL.

Introduction
Retinoic acid (RA), a natural metabolite of vitamin A, plays
an essential role in regulation of differentiation, growth, and
development of normal and malignant epithelial cells in
various tissues and is, therefore, an important regulator of
cancer formation and progression (1, 2). RA and its derivatives
(retinoids) have long been recognized as a group of cancer
chemopreventive and therapeutic agents. Currently, RA is an
approved drug for the treatment of patients with acute
promyelocytic leukemia (1). One underlying mechanism by
which retinoids exert their anticancer effects is induction of
apoptosis (3). However, the mechanisms by which retinoids

including RA induce apoptosis have not been fully elucidated
even though extensive studies have been done in this regard
(2, 3).
Retinoid carries out most of its function by regulation of
gene expression through the activation of its nuclear receptors
known as RA receptors (RAR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR).
The activated and dimerized receptors (e.g., RXR/RAR) bind to
RA response element (RARE) present in the untranslated
regions of target genes to execute the transactivation (4). A
RARE sequence is a hexamer repeat, spaced by N numbers of
nucleotides 50 -PuGGTCA (N) PuGGTCA-30 (Pu ¼ A or G). The
repeat can be direct, everted, or even palindromic (4, 5).
TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL, also called
APO-2L), a member of the TNF family, has attracted much
attention recently because it induces apoptosis in a wide
variety of transformed cells but does not seem to be cytotoxic to normal cells in vitro and in vivo. TRAIL is, therefore,
considered to be a tumor selective, apoptosis-inducing
cytokine, and is being tested in clinical trials as a potential
anticancer agent (6–8). TRAIL induces apoptosis in human
cells by interacting with 2 death domain-containing receptors: TRAIL receptor 1 (TRAIL-R1; also called death receptor
4) and TRAIL receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2; also known as DR5;
ref. 7).
It has been shown that RA induces IFN regulatory factor1–dependent TRAIL expression and subsequently triggers
apoptosis in leukemia cells through a paracrine action of

TRAIL (9, 10). In this study, we show that RA and other
retinoids upregulate TRAIL-R1 expression through a RARdependent mechanism in addition to induction of TRAIL.
Accordingly, RA cooperates with TRAIL to augment apoptosis.
Therefore, the current study has revealed a novel mechanism
by which RA modulates apoptosis, extending our understanding on RA regulation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

bulin G (IgG)1 isotype control (MOPC-21/P3) were purchased
from eBioscience.
Isolation of total RNA and reverse transcriptase PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRI Reagent
(Sigma Chemical Co). cDNA was synthesized from 1 mg of
total RNA using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and was subsequently used for the amplification of
TRAIL-R1. The following primers were used for the amplification of 170-bp fragment from TRAIL-R1 gene: forward 50 CAGAGGGATGGTCAAGGTCAAGG-30 and reverse 50 -CCACAACCTGAGCCGATGC-30 . GAPDH (239 bp) was also amplified as an internal control with the primers, forward
50 -CACAGTCAAGGCTGAGAATGGGAA-30 and reverse 50 GTGGTTCACACCCATCACAAACATG-30 .
Generation of deletion mutants of 50 flanking region of
TRAIL-R1 gene
The reporter plasmids in pGL3-basic-luc carrying the 50 flanking regions of TRAIL-R1 gene (–1,773/þ63, 586/þ63, and
208/þ63) were constructed previously in our laboratory (15).
The following primers, forward (–1,289/þ63) 50 -CGACGCGTGGGTTCAAGCGATTCTCCT-30 and forward (–174/
þ63) 50 -CGACGCGTTGGGACCAAGTGGCAAAA-30 were used
along with the reverse primer, 50 -CTAGCTAGCCATCCTGCCAGGTCAATCC-30 for the amplification of 1,289/þ63 and
174/þ63 fragments. The amplified fragments were then
cloned into pGL3-basic-luc reporter plasmid through Mlu I
and Nhe I restriction sites. The authenticities of the constructs
were confirmed by sequencing.
Transient transfection and luciferase reporter assay
The given cells plated in 24-well plates were transfected
with a TRAIL-R1 reporter plasmid together with pCH110
plasmid harboring b-galactosidase gene using Fugene 6
reagent (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's
protocol. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were treated with
DMSO or RA in serum-free medium for 16 hours and then
harvested in cell-lysis buffer for measurement of the luciferase
activity with the luciferase sssay kit (Promega) using a Sirius
Luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems). The luciferase
activity was normalized with the b-galactosidase activity,
which was measured as described previously (16).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay

Retinoid Acid Regulation of TRAIL-R1 Expression

Silencing of TRAIL-R1 with short hairpin RNA
TRAIL-R1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in pLKO1 lentiviral vector (TRCN0000005934) was purchased from Thermo
Scientific Open Biosystems. The lentivirus preparation and
infection were carried out following the manufacturer's
instructions. To assure silencing effect, the same infection
was conducted twice in a 24-hours interval. Twenty-four hours
after the second infection, the given cells were split and
treated next day with DMSO or ATRA. After an additional
48 hours, the efficiency of the TRAIL-R1 silencing was checked
with the Western blotting. The infected cells were also
reseeded in 96-well plates for cell survival and DNA fragmentation assays as described below.
Silencing of RARs with siRNA
Nonsilencing control siRNA was described previously (13).
siRNA against both RARa and RARg was used as reported (17).
RARb siRNA (sc-29466) was purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Inc. Gene silencing effects were confirmed
by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) with the primers
for RARa (18), RARb (forward: 50 GAATTCCCCCATGCGAGCTGTT 30 and reverse: 50 TCCAGGCTTGCTCGGCCAAT
30 ) and RARg (forward: 50 AGAGTCAGTGTGCGGTTTGGGAGA 30 and reverse: 50 TGGGCCTCCAAAAGTCCCGCT 30 ),
respectively, as described below.
qRT-PCR
We carried out qRT-PCR using power SYBR green PCR
master mix (Applied Biosystems) with respective primers
described above in a 7500 Fast Real Time PCR system from
Applied Biosystems. The following reaction parameters were
used for amplification: 50 C for 2 minutes and 95 C for 10
minutes followed by 40 cycles of 95 C for 15 seconds and 60 C
for 1 minute. GAPDH was used for normalization. The formula, 2–DDCT, where CT refers to threshold cycle, was applied
to calculate the fold change of gene expression.
Cell survival assay
The cell survival was measured by sulforhodamine B (SRB)
assay as described previously (11).
DNA fragmentation assay
The amounts of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments (mononucleosome and oligonucleosomes) formed during apoptosis were measured using a Cell Death Detection
ELISA kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Results
Identification of two putative RAREs in the 50 flanking
region of TRAIL-R1 gene
In an effort to understand the mechanisms by which TRAILR1 is regulated at the transcriptional level, we identified 2
putative RAREs in the 50 -flanking region of TRAIL-R1 gene. The
first RARE had direct repeat motifs of GGGTCA and AGGTCA
separated by 11 nucleotides and thus termed as DR-11. The
second RARE had palindromic motifs of CGGTCA and

ATRA induces TRAIL-R1 expression in human cancer
cells
If the aforementioned RAREs in the 50 -flanking region of
TRAIL-R1 gene are functional, it is plausible to speculate that
ATRA, a natural ligand of RAR, would induce TRAIL-R1
expression. Thus, we examined the effects of ATRA on
TRAIL-R1 expression in a panel of NSCLC and HNSCC cell
lines. By Western blotting, we found that ATRA increased the
levels of TRAIL-R1 protein in H157, A549, PLA-801C, 22B,
183A, and Tu686 cells (Fig. 2A) as well as other NSCLC and
HNSCC cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1). The induction of
TRAIL-R1 occurred 12 hours after treatment with ATRA and
was sustained up to 24 hours (Fig. 2B). ATRA even at 100
nmol/L could increase TRAIL-R1 protein levels (Fig. 2C).
Moreover, we detected cell surface TRAIL-R1 levels in
ATRA-treated cells and found that the MFI was increased
from 16.8 in DMSO-treated cells to 34.9 in ATRA-treated cells,
indicating that ATRA also increases cell surface TRAIL-R1
expression (Fig. 2D). Together, these results indicate that
ATRA induces TRAIL-R1 expression.
TRAIL-R2 is another TRAIL death receptor with similar
function to that of TRAIL-R1. We also examined the effects of
ATRA on TRAIL-R2 and TRAIL expression. ATRA had almost
no effect on TRAIL-R2 expression in the tested cell lines
(Fig. 2A–C). However, it increased TRAIL levels while inducing
TRAIL-R1 expression (Fig. 2E).
ATRA induces TRAIL-R1 expression at the
transcriptional level
To show whether ATRA increases TRAIL-R1 expression
through RAR-dependent transactivation of TRAIL-R1 gene,
we began to test whether ATRA increases TRAIL-R1 transcription, leading to upregulation of TRAIL-R1 expression. As
presented in Fig. 3A, ATRA increased TRAIL-R1 protein levels
in the absence of the transcriptional inhibitor, Act D, or the
protein synthesis inhibitor, CHX, but not in the presence of
Act D or CHX, indicating that inhibition of RNA transcription
blocks ATRA–induced TRAIL-R1 expression. Subsequently, we
studied whether ATRA increases TRAIL-R1 mRNA levels.
Indeed, increased levels of TRAIL-R1 mRNA were detected

in cells exposed to ATRA with RT-PCR (Fig. 3B); the increase of
TRAIL-R1 mRNA occurred at 8 hours and was sustained up to
24 hours after ATRA treatment. In agreement with increase in
TRAIL-R1 protein level, ATRA at 100 nmol/L elevated TRAILR1 mRNA levels (Fig. 3B). Consistently, ATRA–induced
increase in TRAIL-R1 mRNA could be abolished by the presence of Act D (Fig. 3C). We further used qRT-PCR to validate
the induction of TRAIL-R1 mRNA by ATRA. Again, we
observed that ATRA increased TRAIL-R1 mRNA levels in
the absence of Act D, but not in the presence of Act D
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Collectively, it is clear that ATRA
increases TRAIL-R1 transcription.
ATRA induces TRAIL-R1 through an RAR-dependent
mechanism
We next determined whether ATRA increases TRAIL-R1
expression through an RAR-mediated mechanism. To this
end, we first examined the effects of other RAR agonists
on TRAIL-R1 expression. As shown in Fig. 4A, the tested
RAR agonists, Am580 (RARa), CH55 (RARa/b/g), AC55649
(RARb), and CD271 (RARb/g), increased TRAIL-R1 level
as ATRA did. The presence of the RAR antagonist, LE135
(RARb) or Ro415253 (RARa), not only substantially
decreased basal levels of TRAIL-R1, but also abolished

Figure 2. ATRA increases the

the indicated cell lines were
treated with 1 mmol/L ATRA for 16
hours. B, H157 cells were treated
with 1 mmol/L ATRA for the given
times as indicated. C, H157 cells
were treated with the indicated
concentrations of ATRA for 16
hours. E, the indicated cell lines
were treated with the given
concentrations of ATRA for 48

treatments, the whole cell protein

cells and used for the detection of
indicated proteins with Western
blot analysis. D, H157 cells were
exposed to DMSO or 1 mmol/L

TRAIL-R1 upregulation by ATRA (Fig. 4B and C). We also
examined the effects of RAR knockdown on ATRA–induced
TRAIL-R1 expression. With qRT-PCR, we could show that
the tested siRNAs effectively reduced the expression of
RARa, b, and g, respectively, in our cell system (Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating good knockdown efficiencies of these
siRNAs against their corresponding genes. With these siRNAs, we found that the transfection of either RARb or RARa/
g siRNA substantially attenuated the ability of ATRA to
increase TRAIL-R1 expression. Cotransfection of RARb
and RARa/g siRNAs together was more potent than either
siRNA alone in blocking TRAIL-R1 upregulation by ATRA
(Fig. 4D). These data taken together clearly indicate that
ATRA induces an RAR–dependent TRAIL-R1 expression.
Besides, we detected TRAIL-R2 expression in the above
experiments. We noted that CH55, but not other RAR agonists,
increased TRAIL-R2 expression. Moreover, the RAR antagonists, LE135 (at 5 mmol/L) and Ro415253, substantially
reduced basal levels of TRAIL-R1, but increased TRAIL-R2
expression (Figs. 4A–C). Because knockdown of RARs did not
increase TRAIL-R2 levels even though they decreased basal
levels of TRAIL-R1 (Fig. 4D), it is likely that TRAIL-R2 induction by CH55, LE530, and Ro415253 is independent of RARmediated mechanism.

Figure 3. ATRA increases TRAIL-R1 expression at the transcriptional level. A, Act D and CHX block ATRA–induced TRAIL-R1 upregulation. The indicated
cell lines were pretreated with 2.5-mg/mL Act D or 5-mg/mL CHX for 30 minutes and then cotreated with 1 mmol/L ATRA for an additional 16 hours.
The cells were then harvested for preparation of whole cell protein lysates and subsequent Western blotting. B, ATRA increases TRAIL-R1 mRNA levels.

DR-11 is a functional RARE in the mediation of
ATRA-induced TRAIL-R1 transactivation
As stated earlier, there are 2 putative RAREs in the 50 flanking region of TRAIL-R1 gene (Fig. 1). The unaddressed
question is whether they are functional RAREs that mediate
RAR–dependent TRAIL-R1 transactivation by ATRA. To
answer this question, we made several reporter constructs
with different deletions of TRAIL-R1 50 -flanking region, which
contain both DR-11 and Pal-17 (–1,289/þ63), DR-11 only
(–586/þ63) or none of DR-11, and Pal-17 (–208/þ63 and
174/þ63; Fig. 5A). A luciferase assay from the cells transfected with these reporter constructs followed by ATRA treatment showed that ATRA significantly increased luciferase
activity in cells transfected with pGL3 (–1,289/þ63)-luc or
pGL3 (–586/þ63)-luc, but failed to do so in the cells transfected
with pGL3 (–208/þ63)-luc or pGL3 (–174/þ63)-luc. Moreover,
ATRA induced comparable luciferase activities between cells
transfected with pGL3 (–1,289/þ63)-luc and with pGL3 (–586/
þ63)-luc (Fig. 5B). Thus, it seems that the RARE, DR-11, is more

www.aacrjournals.org

important than Pal-17 in mediating ATRA–induced TRAIL-R1
transactivation. In support of this finding, we further carried
out a ChIP assay to test which RARE in the TRAIL-R1 gene
binds to RARs in response to ATRA treatment. As shown in
Fig. 5C, the ChIP assay detected a DNA fragment containing
DR-11, but not a DNA fragment with Pal-17, from DNA precipitated with an anti-RAR antibody, indicating that RARs bind
to DR-11, but not to Pal-17, in response to ATRA treatment.
Taken together, it is clear that DR-11 is the functional RARE
responsible for ATRA–induced TRAIL-R1 expression.
ATRA enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis
It has been documented in many studies that upregulation of
TRAIL death receptors can sensitize cancer cells to TRAILinduced apoptosis (19, 20). Thus, we wanted to know whether
ATRA augments TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Indeed, ATRA
and TRAIL combination was much more potent than each
single agent in decreasing cell survival (Fig. 6A) and in increasing DNA fragmentation (Fig. 6B) in both 22B and A549 cells.

Figure 4. ATRA and other RAR agonists induce TRAIL-R1 expression (A), which can be abolished by RAR antagonists (B and C) or by the knockdown of RARs
(D). A, H157 cells were treated with 1-mmol/L ATRA or other indicated retinoids for 16 hours. B and C, H157 cells were pretreated with the indicated
concentrations of LE135 or Ro415253 for 30 minutes and then cotreated with 1 mmol/L ATRA for 16 hours. D, H157 cells were transfected with control
(Ctrl), RARa/g, RARb, or RARa/g plus RARb siRNAs for 72 hours. The cells were then treated with DMSO or 1 mmol/L ATRA for an additional 16 hours.
After the aforementioned treatments, the whole cell protein lysates were prepared from these cells and used for the detection of indicated proteins with
Western blot analysis.

Moreover, the combination of ATRA and TRAIL was also more
effective than ATRA or TRAIL alone in inducing cleavage of
caspase-3 and PARP (Fig. 6C). Thus, it is apparent that ATRA
augments induction of apoptosis mediated by TRAIL.
Involvement of TRAIL-R1 upregulation in
ATRA-induced apoptosis and enhancement
of TRAIL-induced apoptosis
Finally, we determined whether TRAIL-R1 induction plays a
role in ATRA-induced apoptosis and enhancement of TRAILinduced apoptosis. Hence, we knocked down TRAIL-R1
expression using TRAIL-R1 shRNA (shTRAIL-R1) and then
examined its effects on ATRA-induced apoptosis and on
ATRA/TRAIL-induced apoptosis. As presented in Fig. 7A,
infection of cells with lentivirus carrying shTRAIL-R1 not only
decreased basal levels of TRAIL-R1 but also blocked ATRA–
induced TRAIL-R1 expression when compared with cells
infected with control vector viruses (pLKO1), indicating a
successful knockdown of TRAIL-R1. After prolonged treatment with ATRA, we detected increased levels of cleaved
forms of caspase-3 and PARP in pLKO1-infected cells, but
much less cleaved forms of caspase-3 and PARP in TRAIL-R1–
silenced cells (compared with pLKO1 control cells; Fig. 7A).

This result suggests that TRAIL-R1 upregulation contributes
to ATRA-induced apoptosis. Moreover, we examined the
impact of TRAIL-R1 knockdown on induction of apoptosis
by ATRA and TRAIL combination. As presented in Fig. 7B and
C, combination of ATRA and TRAIL was still more effective
than either agent alone in decreasing cell survival and in
increasing DNA fragmentation in shTRAIL-R1–infected cells;
however, these effects in shTRAIL-R1 cells were substantially
attenuated in comparison with their effects in pLKO1 control
cells. These data suggest that TRAIL-R1 contributes to ATRA/
TRAIL-induced apoptosis, but other mechanisms are involved
in this process as well.

Discussion
Given the critical role of RA/RAR signaling in regulation of
the growth of normal and malignant cells, understanding the
underlying mechanisms, particularly by identifying RA/RARregulated genes, has been a major focus of investigations (21).
The previous discovery of TRAIL induction by RA and its
contribution to RA-induced apoptosis via a paracrine
mechanism (9) had facilitated our understanding of the
mechanisms underlying RA-induced apoptosis. In the current

study, we could detect increased TRAIL expression in our cell
systems exposed to ATRA (Fig. 2E). We also detected cleavage
of caspase-8 in cells exposed to ATRA (data not shown),
suggesting that ATRA activates the extrinsic or death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway. The novel finding in this
study is that ATRA induces TRAIL-R1 expression as we
showed in a panel of NSCLC and HNSCC cell lines (Figs.
2A and Supplementary Fig. S1). Although ATRA is in general a
weaker inducer of apoptosis in solid tumor cells, we indeed
detected apoptosis in cells after prolonged exposure to ATRA
as supported by appearance of cleaved forms of caspase-3 and
PARP (Fig. 7). shRNA-mediated blockage of TRAIL-R1 upregulation by ATRA did attenuate the ability of ATRA to induce
apoptosis as evidenced by inhibition of caspase-3 and PARP
cleavage in shTRAIL-R1 cells (Fig. 7A). These data collectively
suggest that ATRA induces TRAIL-R1 expression that contributes to ATRA-induced apoptosis. Given that TRAIL-R1 is a
known TRAIL receptor, it is plausible to speculate that TRAILR1 induction is involved in TRAIL-dependent paracrine model
of RA-induced apoptosis as suggested previously (9). Thus, our
current finding provides complementary evidence supporting
the involvement of TRAIL/TRAIL-R1 signaling in RA-induced
apoptosis.
In addition to protein change, ATRA increased TRAIL-R1
mRNA levels. Moreover, ATRA–induced TRAIL-R1 expression
at both the protein and mRNA levels was abolished by the
transcriptional inhibitor Act D (Fig. 3). Thus, it is apparent

www.aacrjournals.org

that ATRA increases TRAIL-R1 levels at the transcriptional
level. We noted that the fold changes of TRAIL-R1 induction at
the mRNA levels were generally more modest than the
changes at the protein level. Whether this discrepancy is
caused by differential stabilities of TRAIL-R1 mRNA and
protein or suggests additional regulatory mechanism at the
protein level is unclear.
ATRA typically regulates expression of its target genes
through RAR-dependent transactivation via RAREs in their
promoter regions. The identification of 2 putative RAREs in
the 50 -flanking region of TRAIL-R1 gene led us to speculate that
TRAIL-R1 should be an RAR target gene. Indeed, other synthetic retinoids or RAR agonists with different RAR selectivity
increased TRAIL-R1 expression as ATRA did (Fig. 4A). Besides,
the presence of RAR antagonists, LE135 or Ro415253, not only
reduced basal levels of TRAIL-R1 protein expression, but also
abolished ATRA–induced TRAIL-R1 expression (Fig. 4B and
C). In agreement, knockdown of RARs with siRNA also
reduced basal levels of TRAIL-R1 and blocked TRAIL-R1
induction by ATRA (Fig. 4D). Hence, it is apparent that ATRA
induces TRAIL-R1 through an RAR-dependent mechanism.
We noted that both RAR antagonists and siRNAs substantially
reduced basal levels of TRAIL-R1 expression. It is likely that
the presence of endogenous RA in cells is involved in maintaining basal levels of TRAIL-R1 expression. RAR antagonists
or siRNAs block this effect, leading to downregulation of basal
levels of TRAIL-R1.

Retinoid Acid Regulation of TRAIL-R1 Expression

The 2 putative RAREs in the 50 -flanking region of TRAIL-R1
are not typical RAREs. Deletion experiments showed that
the deletion of the putative RARE, Pal-17, did not impair
the ability of ATRA to increase TRAIL-R1 promoter activity;
however, further deletion of the putative RARE, DR-11, abolished ATRA–induced TRAIL-R1 promoter activity. Moreover,
the ChIP assay showed that the RAR antibody could pull down
the DNA fragment containing the DR-11 RARE, but not the
DNA fragment harboring the Pal-17 RARE from cells exposed
to ATRA, indicating that ATRA treatment induces binding of
RARs to DR-11, but not Pal-17. Collectively, these results
clearly show that DR-11 is a functional RARE in the TRAILR1 gene that mediates TRAIL-R1 transactivation upon ATRA
treatment. Taking all the data discussed above together, we
conclude that TRAIL-R1 is a novel RAR target gene.
TRAIL-R1 is known to be a death receptor for the death
ligand, TRAIL (22). Upregulation of TRAIL death receptors
often results in sensitization of cancer cells to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis (19, 20). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that ATRA
can sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis because
it upregulates TRAIL-R1 expression. Indeed, the combination
of ATRA and TRAIL was much more potent than either agent
alone in decreasing cell survival and in inducing apoptosis in
the tested cancer cell lines (Fig. 6), indicating that ATRA does
sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Moreover,
we found that blockage of ATRA–induced TRAIL-R1 expression through shRNA-mediated gene silencing substantially
attenuated apoptosis induced by the combination of ATRA
and TRAIL (Fig. 7), indicating that TRAIL-R1 upregulation
contributes to enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by
ATRA. We noted that blockage of TRAIL-R1 induction failed to
abolish the ability of ATRA to enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis although it attenuated this process (Fig. 7). Thus, the
data argue that other mechanisms might also be involved in

mediating the enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by
ATRA. Given that ATRA is an approved drug for treatment of
patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (1) and that
TRAIL and TRAIL-R1 agonistic antibodies are being tested
in clinical trials (7, 8), our findings warrant further study to
look at whether ATRA can enhance TRAIL- or TRAIL-R1
agonistic antibody-based cancer therapy in vivo and even in
the clinic.
In summary, the current study has revealed for the first time
that TRAIL-R1 is an RAR target gene. Accordingly, ATRA and
other RAR agonists regulate its expression. TRAIL-R1 upregulation contributes to ATRA-induced apoptosis and
enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis, thus highlighting
a novel mechanism by which ATRA or retinoids modulate
apoptosis.
