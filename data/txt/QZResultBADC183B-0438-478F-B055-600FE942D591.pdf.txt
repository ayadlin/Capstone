Abstract
A third of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (OVCA) will not respond to standard treatment. The
determination of a robust signature that predicts chemoresponse could lead to the identiﬁcation of molecular
markers for response as well as possible clinical implementation in the future to identify patients at risk of
failing therapy. This pilot study was designed to identify biologic processes affecting candidate pathways
associated with chemoresponse and to create a robust gene signature for follow-up studies. After identifying
common pathways associated with chemoresponse in serous OVCA in three independent gene-expression
experiments, we assessed the biologic processes associated with them using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
dataset for serous OVCA. We identiﬁed differential copy-number alterations (CNA), mutations, DNA methylation, and miRNA expression between patients that responded to standard treatment and those who did not
or recurred prematurely. We correlated these signiﬁcant parameters with gene expression to create a signature
of 422 genes associated with chemoresponse. A consensus clustering of this signature identiﬁed two
differentiated clusters with unique molecular patterns: cluster 1 was signiﬁcant for cellular signaling and
immune response (mainly cell-mediated); and cluster 2 was signiﬁcant for pathways involving DNA-damage
repair and replication, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Validation through consensus clustering was performed in ﬁve
independent OVCA gene-expression experiments. Genes were located in the same cluster with consistent
agreement in all ﬁve studies (k coefﬁcient  0.6 in 4). Integrating high-throughput biologic data have created a
robust molecular signature that predicts chemoresponse in OVCA. Cancer Res; 74(14); 3902–12. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Epithelial ovarian cancer (OVCA) has the highest mortality
rate of all gynecologic cancers (1), mainly because more than
70% of patients present with advanced stage and will have
disseminated intraperitoneal disease at diagnosis (2). But also
because between 20% and 30% will not respond to the initial
treatment consisting of a combination of cytoreductive surgery
and a platinum-based chemotherapy (3). Even in some patients
with a complete initial response to chemotherapy, the disease
will recur and eventually develop resistance to multiple drugs
(4). Several mechanisms have been described to contribute to

chemoresponse, including drug efﬂux, increased cellular glutathione levels, increased DNA repair, and drug tolerance, but
the exact mechanisms are not fully deﬁned (5–7), and there are
no valid clinical biomarkers or molecular signatures that
effectively predict response to chemotherapy (8, 9). Understanding the underlying processes could lead to the identiﬁcation of prognostic signatures, which in turn, could be used to
stratify patients who are likely to develop resistance to standard chemotherapy and, thus, could beneﬁt from alternative
strategies (9).
In previous studies, we have identiﬁed a series of molecular
signaling pathways associated with OVCA response to chemotherapy in vitro as well as in clinical settings (10–13). We
selected pathways associated with chemoresponse to design a
pilot study aimed to identify biologic processes that inﬂuence
expression. For this purpose, we used publicly available data
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ovarian cancer datasets, gene expression from ovarian cancer samples available at
the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository, and OVCA
data from our laboratory previously published. All biologic
data from these diverse sources also included information
about response to chemotherapy. The objectives of this study
were to identify biologic processes affecting gene expression of
candidate pathways and create a molecular signature associated with chemoresponse. Also, we aimed to validate this
molecular signature across independent gene-expression
microarray experiments.

Molecular Analysis of Chemoresponse in Ovarian Cancer

Materials and Methods
Sources of data
Only serous OVCA specimens were used for these comparisons. The study included the following sets:
1. OVCA cultured cell lines A2008, A2780CP, A2780S, C13,
IGROV1, OV2008, OVCAR5, and T8 (12). Cells were
subjected to sequential treatment with increasing doses
of cisplatin. Both cisplatin resistance and genome-wide
expression changes were measured serially at baseline
and after three and six cisplatin treatment/expansion
cycles. Gene expression using Affymetrix Human U133
Plus 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix) was uploaded at the GEO,
accession number GSE23553.
2. GEO clinical datasets: 127 serous OVCA with
chemoresponse information from the datasets GSE23554
(12) and GSE3149 (14) with Affymetrix Human Genome
U133 Plus 2.0 and U133A arrays; 240 serous OVCA with
chemoresponse information from the dataset GSE9891
(15) with Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays;
50 serous OVCA with chemoresponse information from
the dataset GSE28739 (16) with Agilent-012097 Human 1A
arrays (V2; Agilent Technologies); 110 serous OVCA with
chemoresponse information from the dataset GSE17260
(17) with Agilent-014850 Whole Human Genome 4  44 K
arrays; 185 serous OVCA from the dataset GSE26712 (18)
with Affymetrix human U133A arrays.
3. TCGA (www.cancergenome.nih.gov): More than 20
different cancer types are included in this initiative,
including more than 560 serous OVCAs, the most common
histologic subtype of OVCA. TCGA comprehensive
genomic information includes copy-number variation,
SNPs, miRNA expression, gene expression (mRNA), and
DNA methylation as well as clinical and outcome
information. Data from TCGA were downloaded,
normalized, formatted, and organized for the integration
and analysis with other biologic datasets in accordance
with the precepts of the TCGA data sharing agreements.
All data collection and processing, including the consenting
process, were performed after approval by a local Institutional
Review Board and in accord with the TCGA Human Subjects
Protection and Data Access Policies, adopted by the National
Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome
Research Institute.
Clinical outcomes
Complete response (CR) was deﬁned as complete disappearance of all disease up to 6 months after treatment. In
patients with incomplete response (IR) the disease either not
responded or progressed during treatment (refractory) or
recurred within 6 months of treatment completion (resistant;
refs. 3, 19, 20).
Data analysis
Copy-number alteration. Samples from Agilent Human
Genome CGH Microarray 244A (Agilent Technologies) were
processed and DNA sequences were aligned to NCBI Build 36 of
the human genome. Circular binary segmentation was used to

www.aacrjournals.org

identify regions with altered copy number in each chromosome (21). The copy number at a particular genomic location
was computed on the basis of the segmentation mean log ratio
data. We found regions with frequent CNA among all samples
by performing genomic identiﬁcation of signiﬁcant targets in
cancer (GISTIC) analysis (22). The signiﬁcance of CNA at a
particular genomic location is determined on the basis of false
discovery rate (FDR), as previously described (23). To determine the performance of our strategy, we initially proceed with
the analysis of the whole sample set, and then repeated the
methodology with only samples from patients that demonstrated CR (n ¼ 294) and IR (n ¼ 158). CNA in both scenarios
was consistent.
Mutation analysis. Somatic mutation detection, calling,
annotation, and validation have been extensively discussed
previously (23). Somatic mutation information resulting from
Illumina Genome Analyzer DNA Sequencing GAIIx platform
(Illumina Inc.) was downloaded and formatted for analysis.
Mutation information was downloaded as level 3, or validated
somatic mutations. Somatic mutation information was available from 137 samples from patients with CR and 55 with IR.
For those patients, there were 6,716 unique genes presenting
some type of validated somatic mutation. These included:
frame shift insertions and deletions, in-frame insertions or
deletions, missense, nonsense, and nonstop mutations, silence,
splice site, and translation start site mutations. All independent
signiﬁcant mutated genes were correlated with gene expression of the candidate pathways genes to determine whether
mutated genes were associated or inﬂuenced expression of
those pathways. To correlate mutated genes with gene expression, we used the Spearman rank correlation test, as both
variables are not completely independent one from another.
We assessed statistical signiﬁcance of the correlation by computing q value for FDR (qFDR) and P value, corrected for
multiple analyses (24).
Gene expression and correlation with CNA. Raw geneexpression data were downloaded from the TCGA Data Portal
(level 1), extracted, loaded, and normalized with the analytical
software, BRB-ArrayTools. In total, 594 microarrays samples
analyzed with Affymetrix HT Human Genome U133 Array: 584
coming from cancer tissue and 10 coming from ovarian normal
samples. DNA sequences were aligned to NCBI Build 36 of the
human genome. There were 452 arrays with clinical information about chemoresponse. During the circular binary segmentation analysis of the CNA, a gene-centric table is created,
which contains a value for each gene covered in the genomic
array. This value is assigned on the basis of the segmentation
mean log ratios. The gene-centric table is required for the
correlation analysis between copy number and gene expression. Positive correlation between gene expression and CNA
(increased CNA/increased gene expression, and decreased
CNA/decreased gene expression) was performed using the
Spearman rank correlation test, as the expression between
genes is not completely independent one from another. Statistical signiﬁcance was assessed with qFDR and P value, and
corrected for multiple analyses (24).

patients between complete responders and incomplete

responders, we used the Class Prediction Tool of BRB-ArrayTools. Genes differentially expressed between both classes at
signiﬁcance level P < 0.001 were included in the predictor and
evaluated with several methods. To assess how accurately the
groups are predicted by this multivariate class predictor, a
cross-validated misclassiﬁcation rate is computed, usually in
the form of the leave-one-out cross-validation method. For
TCGA gene-expression analysis, 40 samples in each group (CR
vs. IR) had 90% power of detect the differentially expressed gene,
with a type 1 error of 0.001. A similar experiment, using the same
software (BRB ArrayTools), same statistics, same outcomes
deﬁnitions (CR vs. IR), and list of genes from the gene signature
identiﬁed in the testing set (TCGA), was designed to validate the
results of the signature proﬁle in independent available databases: GEO# GSE9891 (15), GSE28739 (16), and GSE23554 (12).
Methylation analysis and correlation with gene expression. DNA methylation data with b values, methylated (M),
and unmethylated (U) intensities were downloaded from the
TCGA Data Portal (level 2), extracted, loaded, and normalized.
In total, 574 arrays samples of Illumina Inﬁnium Human DNA
Methylation 27 (Illumina Inc.): 572 cancer, 2 normal. There
were 453 unique DNA-methylation arrays from serous OVCA
with clinical information about chemoresponse. Differential
DNA methylation of gene promoters was computed on the
basis of b values. b values for each sample and locus were
calculated as [M/(MþU); ref. 23]. Differences of gene b values
between the classes (CR vs. IR) at the univariate signiﬁcance
level of P < 0.001 were considered signiﬁcant. Rank-based
Spearman correlation was used to allow for nonlinear relationships between DNA methylation and gene expression, along
with P values. To control the FDR, we used the q value for
statistical signiﬁcance (qFDR; ref. 24) and Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.
miRNA expression analysis and its correlation with gene
expression. Raw miRNA expression data were downloaded
from the TCGA Data Portal (level 1), extracted, loaded, and
normalized with the analytical software, BRB-ArrayTools. In
total, 595 microarrays samples of Agilent Human miRNA
Microarray Rel12.0 (Agilent Technologies Inc.): 585 cancer,
10 normal. There were 455 unique miRNA expression arrays
from serous OVCA with clinical information about chemoresponse (23). Differences of miRNA expression between the
classes (CR vs. IR) at the univariate signiﬁcance level of P < 0.05
were considered signiﬁcant, as there were 619 unique miRNA
tested. Rank-based Spearman correlation was used to allow for
nonlinear relationships between miRNA expression and gene
expression, along with P values. To control the FDR, we used
the q value for statistical signiﬁcance (qFDR; ref. 24) and
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.
Transcription factor–binding sites and their association
with gene expression. To identify transcription factor (TF)
and their binding sites within the CNA-correlated pathway
(CCP) gene subset, we used publicly available search tools, The
Transcription Factor Database (TRANSFAC; ref. 25). TRANSFAC
is a knowledge-base containing published data on eukaryotic
TFs, their experimentally proven binding sites, and regulated
genes (26) that uses a range of tools and algorithms to search
DNA sequences for predicted TF-binding sites through high-

3904

Cancer Res; 74(14) July 15, 2014

throughput promoter analysis. Differential gene expression
between CR and IR was performed on those genes within the
CCP set found to have TF-binding sites by TRANSFAC database.
Differences of gene expression between the classes (CR vs. IR) at
the univariate signiﬁcance level of P < 0.01 were considered
signiﬁcant, as 1,700 genes were introduced in the analysis.
Nonnegative matrix factorization consensus clustering of
the ﬁnal model. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is
an unsupervised learning algorithm that has been shown to
identify molecular patterns when applied to gene-expression
data. NMF detects context-dependent patterns of gene expression in complex biologic systems (15, 23). This method computes multiple k-factor factorization decompositions of the
expression matrix and evaluates the stability of the solutions
using a cophenetic coefﬁcient. The ﬁnal subclasses of genes
were deﬁned on the basis of the most stable k-factor decomposition and visual inspection of gene-by-gene correlation
matrices (for details of the method; refs. 15, 23).
Software
The majority of analyses were performed using R statistical
package for statistical computing and graphics (www.r-project.org) as background, using Bioconductor packages as open
source software for bioinformatics (bioconductor.org). Analysis of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to assess
CNA and analysis of gene expression were performed using
Biometric Research Branch (BRB) ArrayTools, an integrated
package for the visualization and statistical analysis that uses
Excel (Microsoft) as front end, and with tools developed in the
R statistical system. BRB ArrayTools were developed by Dr.
Richard Simon (Biometric Research Branch, Division of Cancer
Treatment and Diagnosis, National Cancer Institute, Rockville,
MD) and the BRB ArrayTools development team.
MultiExperiment Viewer was used to implement the NMF
consensus clustering and is part of the TM4 suite of tools
(http://www.tm4.org/) developed in Java, an open-source, and
freely available collection of tools of use to a wide range of
laboratories conducting microarray experiments.
Pathway enrichment analysis. To identify overrepresented and signiﬁcant pathways among the selected list of genes,
we used MetaCore (GeneGo, Inc.), an integrated and curated
"knowledge-based" platform for pathway analysis. The P value
of signiﬁcant associated pathways represents the probability
that a particular gene of an experiment is placed into a pathway
by chance, considering the numbers of genes in the experiment, and total genes across all pathways.

Results
Selection of candidate pathways associated with
chemoresponse
Our analysis focused on gene-expression data from different
sources to identify genes and pathways involved in OVCA
chemoresistance. Sources included OVCA cultured cell lines
that underwent progressive higher doses of chemotherapy and
tested with a chemosensitivity analysis measured by IC50. Then
gene expression of 48 samples was compared before and after
the treatment (12). Also, we included clinical samples gathered

from our own institution, 127 samples, available at the GEO
repository with accession number GSE23554 (10, 12, 13), OVCA
samples from 240 patients from the GEO database GSE9891
(15), and data from TCGA, with 465 OVCA samples (23). Only
serous OVCA specimens with information of response to
chemotherapy were used for comparison. Chemoresponse, as
deﬁned in methods, was a signiﬁcant independent survival
factor in TCGA dataset survival analysis (Cox proportional
HR), even after control for age, stage, and optimal surgery (P <
1015; Supplementary Fig. S1). We determined genes that were
differentially expressed between patients with CR and patients
with IR in the three clinical databases; furthermore, we evaluated genes differentially expressed in the OVCA cell lines
based on in vitro chemosensitivity analysis. A series of genes
were common between these comparison analyses: TIMP3,
OLFML3, C10orf26, COPZ2, PDGFD, OMD, PKD2, SNRPA,
COL8A1, GCNT1, CDK5RAP3, PRPF40A, RAB35, MAPK14, PARN,
NCRNA00184, ERCC5, C13orf33, LHFP, KIAA1033, GJB1, SVEP1,
TPM1, and IMPACT (Supplementary Fig. S2). We introduced
these common differentially expressed genes in the pathway
enrichment analysis by GeneGO (MetaCore), and only those
signiﬁcant pathways that were previously described as asso-

ciated with chemoresponse in OVCA were used as candidates
pathways: the O-glycan biosynthesis pathway (P ¼ 7  103),
described in our previous in vitro studies of chemosensitivity
(10), the transport RAB1A regulation pathway (P ¼ 5  103)
that controls vesicle trafﬁc within the cell (27) and members of
the RAS oncogene family (11, 28), MAPK14 and PDGFD (29) part
of the MAPK signaling pathway (P ¼ 104), involved in the
initiation of a G2 delay after UV radiation (30) and also
identiﬁed in in vitro studies (11). Only these candidate pathways, previously associated with chemoresponse, were used in
the rest of the study.
Identiﬁcation of elements inﬂuencing expression of
candidate pathways genes
TCGA datasets for genomic copy-number alterations (CNA),
mutation and methylation analysis, and miRNA expression
were used to identify the elements that could potentially
inﬂuence the expression of our candidate pathways. Main
clinical and biologic data from TCGA patients included in
our study are summarized in Table 1. The TRANSFAC database (25, 31, 32) was used to predict TF-binding sites in our
analysis.

CNA analysis and correlation with gene expression
Of the 452 patients with clinical information about chemoresponse (294 CR and 158 IR) and gene-expression data from
specimens collected at diagnosis, 435 underwent CGH to
determine CNA. Supplementary Figure S3 and Supplementary
Table S1 summarize whole genome signiﬁcant somatic gains
and losses determined by the GISTIC analysis (22). CNA could
be divided into regional alterations, when gain or loss of
genetic material affects more than 50% of the chromosomal
arm and focal alterations when gains/losses are smaller (23). In
a genome-wide assessment, there were four signiﬁcant regional alterations with gains, 3q22.1-q29, 8p11.21-q24.3, 12p13.33p11.21, and 20q11.21-q13.33, and eight with losses, 4q13.3q35.2, 6q15-q27, 8p23.3-p12, 13q11-q34, 16q12.2-q24.3,
17p13.3-q21.2, 18q12.2-q23, and 22q11.22-q13.33. Apart from
the candidate pathways genes, these altered regions contained
other genes that may be important or associated with

3906

Cancer Res; 74(14) July 15, 2014

unknown mechanisms of chemoresponse in OVCA. Details of
regional and focal CNA somatic gains and losses affecting
genes of the candidate pathways are summarized in Table 2.
Of the genes included in these candidate regions with CNA
(6,622 genes) only 2,364 genes showed statistically signiﬁcant

Spearman rank correlation (Supplementary Table S2). Positive
statistical correlation was deﬁned as CNA gain with increased
gene expression, or CNA loss with decreased gene expression,
with a P value of <104 to account for multiple comparisons
(23). These 2,364 genes with CNA and correlated gene expression, including 68 genes from the three candidate pathways,
may inﬂuence or be associated with chemoresponse through
our candidate pathways, and will be used for the remainder of
our analyses and referred as the CCP gene subset.

signature predictive of CR versus IR in the CCP subset of genes
(Supplementary Fig. S4A and Supplementary Table S3). Validation of the gene signature was performed in previously
published gene-expression studies, including one from our
own institution (12, 15, 16). For this validation, we used the
same study design used in the testing set (TCGA), a retrospective design of microarray gene expression with additional
information about chemoresponse, the same software used
in the testing set (BRB ArrayTools), same statistics (t test at
signiﬁcance level P < 0.001), same outcomes deﬁnitions (CR vs.
IR), and the same list of genes from the gene signature in the
testing set. The gene signature proﬁle was validated in all
independent databases with a P value of <0.001 for GEO#
GSE9891 (15), a P value of 0.01 for GSE28739 (16), and a P
value of 0.02 for GSE23554 (Supplementary Fig. S5; ref. 12).

miRNA expression analysis and its correlation with gene
expression
Gene expression is also regulated by miRNAs. As previously,
differentially miRNA expression was performed in 455 patients
with available high-throughput data and information about
chemoresponse. A heatmap of the 38 miRNA differentially
expressed between the CR and IR groups is represented in
Supplementary Fig. S4D. A list of these miRNA could be
reviewed at Supplementary Table S5. Possible interactions
between differentially expressed miRNA and their possible
inﬂuence in the expression of our candidate pathways were
explored with a corrected correlation between miRNA expression and gene expression of the CCP subset (P value and qFDR
 106). Differentially expressed miRNAs and their correlated
genes were also included to the model or signature.

Somatic mutations and their correlation with gene
expression
Somatic mutations in genes have been shown to inﬂuence
gene-expression patterns, of both individual genes and distinct
pathways (33–35). Only validated mutations were used for
these series of analyses (23). Mutations of 6,716 genes were
available for 192 patient samples with information about
chemoresponse at the TCGA data site. We performed a logistic
regression analysis to determine which mutations were associated with chemoresponse (CR vs. IR). KRT72, MYO5C, ODZ1,
SMARCA4, and TP53 were statistically associated with the
outcome. SMARCA4 had mutations in 0.7% of CR samples and
in 7.3% of IR samples (P ¼ 0.04); and TP53 had mutations in
88.3% of CR samples and in 72.7% of IR samples (P ¼ 0.01).
Spearman rank correlation, with correction for multiple comparisons, was used to assess the correlation between signiﬁcant mutated genes and gene expression of the CCP gene
subset (P value and qFDR  104; Supplementary Fig. S4B).
Signiﬁcant mutated genes as well as their 22 correlated genes
with signiﬁcant change in gene expression were included in the
model and added to the signiﬁcant gene signature identiﬁed
from the CCP gene subset.

TF-binding sites and their association with gene
expression
Because gene expression is regulated at the transcriptional
level, we examined web-based tools that use algorithms to
search DNA sequences for predicted TF-binding sites through
high-throughput promoter analysis. TRANSFAC was used to
predict TF-binding sites in genes of the candidate pathways
associated with OVCA chemoresponse (31). Of the 2,364 genes of
the CCP subset, 1,772 genes were identiﬁed to have TF-binding
sites in their promoter area; 59 of these genes had a differential
gene expression between CR and IR (Supplementary Fig. S6A
and Supplementary Table S6). Only these 59 genes harboring TFbinding sites that presented both CNAs and differentially gene
expression were also introduced in the ﬁnal model.

Methylation analysis and its correlation with gene
expression
Epigenetic gene regulation also may affect expression of
candidate pathways by inactivating gene function (36). As we
did with mutations, an analysis of DNA methylation status was
performed in 440 patients with high-throughput data and
information about chemoresponse available. Sixty-nine genes
were differentially methylated between the CR and IR groups
(Supplementary Fig. S4C). A list of these genes could be
reviewed at Supplementary Table S4. To explore possible
interactions between differentially methylated genes and their
possible inﬂuence in the expression of our candidate pathways,
we performed a correlation, with correction for multiple
comparisons, between these differentially methylated genes
and the expression of the CCP gene subset (P value and qFDR 
106). Differentially methylated genes and their correlated
expressed genes were also added to signiﬁcant gene signature
and mutations found previously to improve the molecular
model.

External validation of the ﬁnal model with NMF
consensus clustering
The combined data from all signiﬁcant and correlated genes
included 422 unique different genes introduced in the ﬁnal
model (Supplementary Table S7). A cluster analysis of these
ﬁnal models was performed with the NMF consensus clustering, a type of unsupervised learning algorithm that has been
shown to identify molecular patterns when applied to geneexpression data (15). This analysis yielded two clusters with
differentiated gene patterns (Fig. 1A). Attempts to create
models with more than two clusters resulted in lower cophenetic correlation coefﬁcients (Fig. 1B), and less harmonic
consensus matrices (Fig. 1C).
Validation of this molecular pattern with two deﬁned clusters observed in the ﬁnal signature model of TCGA data was
performed in ﬁve publicly available independent OVCA geneexpression datasets with the same analytical tool, NMF consensus clustering. All these independent gene experiments also
showed two differentiated clusters with the highest cophenetic
correlation coefﬁcients and the most harmonious consensus
matrices (12, 14, 15, 17, 18). Comparison of these six sets of two
clusters (TCGA and ﬁve validation sets) showed an unprecedented external validation of molecular signatures associated
with chemoresponse in OVCA (Fig. 2).
We also determined whether the individual genes were placed
by the NMF consensus clustering within the same cluster in all
databases used for validation. The level of agreement measured

package, which mines the KEGG database (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, www.genome.jp/kegg). The
correlation matrix of each cluster denotes overrepresented
predominant pathways (Fig. 3). Cluster 1 showed a significant representation of cellular signaling and immune
response (mainly cell-mediated) pathways, but also several
types of metabolic pathways (Fig. 4; Supplementary Table
S8). Three fourths (75%) of all signaling and metabolic
pathways genes in cluster 1 were overexpressed in the IR
tumors with respect to the CR samples, with the general
perception that IR tumors were engaged in higher metabolic
rates through external and internal stimuli. Cluster 2 was
signiﬁcant for pathways involving DNA-damage repair and
replication as well as cell cycle and apoptosis, all of them
with strong inﬂuence by mutated TP53. Cluster 2 also
presented signiﬁcant pathways related to cancer and cytoskeleton conﬁguration and structure (Fig. 4; Supplementary
Table S9). Two thirds of all cell cycle and DNA repair genes
presented elevated expression in CR tumors when compared
with IR tumors, probably driven by mutated key elements of
these pathways, like TP53, and increased expression of TFs,
like ATF6B, CRTC1, E2F1, SIN3B, and NFIX.

Discussion
Patients suffering from platinum-refractory or -resistant
ovarian cancer have a median overall survival of around 12
to 13 months (3). Furthermore, these patients become resistant
to multiple drugs early on the course of treatment of their
disease and, thus, it is challenging to establish efﬁcacious
treatment strategies (38). The objective of our study was to
identify biologic processes associated with chemoresponse so

www.aacrjournals.org

we may, in the future, identify patients at risk for standard
chemotherapy resistance, thus eligible for novel strategies.
Also, knowledge of mechanisms involved in chemoresponse
may help design new strategies as molecular-targeted therapy
is gaining traction (39). Our study determined chemoresponse
as the most signiﬁcant independent clinical factor for survival
(P < 1015) in the TCGA database, agreeing with daily clinical
practice and published clinical trials (20).
Despite increasing knowledge about mechanisms of chemoresponse in tumor cells there are no valid clinical biomarkers or molecular signatures that could effectively predict
response to chemotherapy (8, 9). Initial analysis of gene
proﬁling aiming to identify functional processes associated
with chemoresponse in OVCA had showed little overlap
between studies looking for expression signatures or pathways
associated with response to therapy (40). Previously, several
groups have used integration of "omics" data in OVCA to
predict other clinical outcomes (41–43). By integrating the
comprehensive characterization of TCGA data, namely, CNA,
gene mutations, DNA methylation, miRNA expression, and TFbinding sites location, into an analytical framework for gene
expression, we have created a robust molecular signature that
predicts chemoresponse in OVCA. This model, with two clusters involving previous known mechanisms of chemoresponse
(9), was the most robust in the TCGA database; but what is even
more important and unprecedented in our study is the external
validation of the TCGA model with other ﬁve independent
gene-expression studies of OVCA (12, 14, 15, 17, 18). These
ﬁndings demonstrate consistency of this signature across
diverse studies and platforms that we believe is due to the
selection of microarray experiments with the same tumor type
of OVCA (serous), statistical design of analyses, and adequately
powered. Furthermore, both clusters in the model included the
same individual genes with substantial agreement in all but
one of the ﬁve independent gene-expression sets, in which the
agreement was moderate (Fig. 2). We think that adding elements to the model that did not result exclusively from the
differential gene expression of microarrays (CNA, mutations,
methylation, miRNA, and TF-binding sites) added stability to
the molecular signature and provided enough range to overcome validation difﬁculties observed by gene-expression
experiments alone due to tumor heterogeneity (8, 9).
Most genes included in our molecular signature for chemoresponse are drawn from cellular functions previously associated with response to chemotherapy (9). These biologic
processes include cell signaling pathways, immune response
pathways, and several types of metabolic pathways that are
involved in DNA-damage repair and replication, cell cycle and
apoptosis, all of them also have been associated with cancer
transformation and proliferation (44). In ovarian cancers,
signaling transduction cascades from the pathways PI3K/
AKT/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK/ERK (with representation in our molecular model, Supplementary Table S7) may
result in diverse effects, including cell proliferation, invasion,
angiogenesis, apoptosis evasion, and response to chemotherapy (44, 45). The MAPK signaling pathway is also connected to
the Ras pathway (which includes PAK4), that also regulates cell
morphology, cytoskeletal organization, and cell proliferation

and migration; PAK4 can also function as an antiapoptotic

GTPases to cytoskeleton reorganization and nuclear signaling.
Both PAK4 and RHOT1 are included in cluster 2. The Ras gene
family (which RASA1 is part) encodes membrane-associated,
guanine nucleotide–binding proteins that are involved also in
the control of cellular proliferation and differentiation, and
have a weak intrinsic GTPase activity, effectors of Ras oncogene action (47). MAPKs may also have a role in early gene
expression by modifying the chromatin environment of target
genes (48), an action regulated through phosphorylation of

NCAPG, a component of the condensin complex that is
required for both interphase and mitotic condensation, is
present in cluster 2 of the chemoresponse model. Animal
models with condensin mutations, DNA damage induced by
UV radiation is not repaired, and cells arrested by hydroxyurea
do not recover (49). In our gene signature, it is notable that a set
of genes map to the DNA repair pathway (mainly through
homologous recombination), like RAD52, and elements of the
PARP family, like PARP12. PARPs inhibitors have been proven
to be efﬁcacious in the treatment of OVCA in carriers of BRCA1

or BRCA2 mutations (50). Also notable are the results of
bevacizumab, a humanized antibody against VEGF, in the
adjuvant treatment of OVCA (51). PDGFB, a component of the
VEGF signaling pathway, is present in cluster 1, with other
numerous components of cell signaling pathways. With all
these interconnections between signaling pathways, DNAdamage repair, and cell cycle, alternative strategies to standard
therapies may have to involve a combination of cross-speciﬁc
drugs to avoid by-pass of the blocked path (52).
The strength of our study is that our discovery set has been
based on a large genomic dataset, which has high benchmarks
for quality control and processing (TCGA). The large sample
size confers adequate power to detect important patterns
while at the same time, it overcomes possible bias introduced
by outliers; moreover, it permits better selection of the histologic type (serous) and outcome of interest (chemoresponse) to
improve homogeneity. We believe that those are major factors
inﬂuencing in the important external validation of the molecular signature in ﬁve independent gene-expression experiments, which is unprecedented in microarray analysis (40).
Other major factor inﬂuencing a signiﬁcant validation is the
integration of diverse biologic data, other than gene expression, in the ﬁnal model. For the validation process, we used two
OVCA datasets that were used initially to identify candidate
pathways (12, 15). These datasets had the closest clinical
information, including chemoresponse, and study design to
TCGA. To avoid data over ﬁtting in the validation process,
though, we added three independent gene-expression experiments not used before, despite presenting minor differences in
study design and platform content (14, 17, 18).
A major limitation of this study is its retrospective nature.
Although the outcome of interest (chemoresponse) was collected, we had to reformat it to ﬁt our deﬁnition of CR and IR.
Only patients with information about the outcome variable
were ﬁnally introduced in the analysis. There was also extensive information about the speciﬁcs of patient treatment after
diagnosis, including types of drugs received. Nearly all patients
received standard treatment, with more than 99% of them
getting a platinum-based chemotherapy (Table 1). Initial
treatment with platinum may select for some of molecular
patterns observed in our signature, like cell cycle or DNA repair
pathways, due to the DNA adducts induced by platinum (53).
Consequently, our molecular model would be most applicable

to OVCA that would receive initial platinum-based treatment,
and less suited for other scenarios with different initial therapeutic strategies. Similarly, it would be interesting to investigate whether the signature is valid in other solid tumors
treated with comparable platinum-based combinations.
In summary, integration of diverse biologic data into gene
expression may strengthen gene signature models for prediction of OVCA chemoresponse. Robust validation over ﬁve
independent publicly available gene-expression experiments
supports these ﬁndings. Nonetheless, this model has to be
validated in vitro or vivo models before can be tested clinically.
It would be very interesting to apply this molecular signature
model to other solid tumors that usually receive platinumbased therapy.
