integrate multiple upstream inputs, targeting pathways downstream of the receptors could conceivably result in greater
therapeutic efficacy and broader applicability. For example,
abolishing signal transduction through MEK offers the potential
advantage of inhibiting both proliferation-promoting and antiapoptotic signals originating from either activated cell surface
receptors or mutant RAS and B-RAF. In breast cancer, activation of
the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade is associated with increased
metastasis risk (6). Furthermore, cross-talk between the RAF-MEKERK pathway and the estrogen receptor (ERa) might mediate
tamoxifen resistance (7). Although these findings validate the RAFMEK-ERK pathway as a therapeutic target in breast cancer, clinical
studies of MEK inhibitors have shown only limited antitumor
activity (8, 9). The mechanisms underlying the poor clinical
response to inhibition of MEK remain unclear and no markers of
susceptibility or resistance to MEK inhibitors suitable for guiding
patient selection have been identified.
The availability of advanced genomic and proteomic technologies has facilitated capturing the complex molecular responses
to defined stimuli at a systems level. For example, reverse-phase
protein array (RPPA) represents an emerging proteomic
technology allowing for comprehensive assessment of signal
transduction pathways at the protein and phosphoprotein
level (10, 11). Here, we pursued a systems-based experimental
strategy to create an in-depth understanding of the responses of
breast cancer cells to MEK inhibition. We found basal-type
breast cancers to be particularly sensitive to such agents. Furthermore, a potent negative feedback loop between the RAF-MEKERK and PI3K pathways was discovered, which counteracts
effects of MEK inhibition on cell cycle and apoptosis induction.
In agreement with this finding, combined treatment with MEK
and PI3K inhibitors resulted in marked tumor cell growth
inhibition.

Abstract
Specific inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) have been
developed that efficiently inhibit the oncogenic RAF-MEK-ERK
pathway. We used a systems-based approach to identify breast
cancer subtypes particularly susceptible to MEK inhibitors
and to understand molecular mechanisms conferring resistance to such compounds. Basal-type breast cancer cells were
found to be particularly susceptible to growth inhibition by
small-molecule MEK inhibitors. Activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway in response to MEK
inhibition through a negative MEK-epidermal growth factor
receptor-PI3K feedback loop was found to limit efficacy.
Interruption of this feedback mechanism by targeting MEK
and PI3K produced synergistic effects, including induction of
apoptosis and, in some cell lines, cell cycle arrest and
protection from apoptosis induced by proapoptotic agents.
These findings enhance our understanding of the interconnectivity of oncogenic signal transduction circuits and have
implications for the design of future clinical trials of MEK
inhibitors in breast cancer by guiding patient selection and
suggesting rational combination therapies. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The RAS-RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)-ERK and
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-PTEN-AKT signaling pathways
play central roles in the signal transduction networks promoting
tumor initiation and tumor progression. This is highlighted by the
high frequency of mutations of RAS, RAF, PI3KCA, AKT, and PTEN
as well as amplification of AKT present in a broad spectrum of
human malignancies (1–5). Because signal transduction networks

Figure 1. Comparison of sensitivity of breast cancer cell lines to MEK inhibitor CI1040. Forty-six basal or luminal breast cancer cell lines were treated with increasing
doses of CI1040 and cell viability was assessed at 0 h (time of drug addition) and at 72 h after treatment. GI50 was calculated from the dose-response curves as
described in Materials and Methods. Data are presented as GI50 (mol/L) of cell lines in the order of most sensitive to most resistant (from left to right ). Red and green

Supplementary Table S1.

mRNA predictors. P values were computed using Fisher’s exact test, with
Affymetrix HT_Hgu133A as a reference set. We used a threshold of P < 0.01
to identify significant pathways.
Identification of protein predictors of response to MEK inhibitors.
Protein expression profiles were generated in 35 breast cancer cell lines
using conventional Western blot analysis for the detection of 64 proteins. In
addition, expression of 34 proteins was assessed by RPPA. Proteins
predicting response to MEK inhibition were identified using the
SplineMarker algorithm.
Proteomic analysis of MEK inhibition by RPPA. MDAMB231 cells
were transferred to low serum conditions 24 h before treatment. The cells
were pretreated with U0126 (10 Amol/L) or DMSO (control) for 30 min, after
which EGF was added at a final dose of 10 ng/mL. Protein lysates were
collected at 1, 4, and 24 h after EGF stimulation, denatured in SDS sample
buffer, and spotted onto nitrocellulose-coated FAST slides (Whatman) using
a GeneTAC G3 arrayer (Genomic Solutions). Proteins were detected using a
set of validated antibodies (Supplementary Materials and Methods) and
quantified as described before (18–20).
Preparation of protein lysates and Western blots. The cells were
treated with drugs either in low serum or in full serum conditions as
indicated in the figures. For the low serum conditions, cells were washed in
the medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated in this
medium for 24 h. Drugs or DMSO (control) was added directly to this
medium, and 30 min later, EGF was added at a final dose of 10 ng/mL. Cells
were harvested at time intervals after EGF stimulation. For the full serum
conditions, cells were grown in their normal growth medium and, at
48 h after plating, treated with the drugs. Protein lysates were prepared
from cells at 70% to 90% confluency. The cells were washed in ice-cold
PBS and then extracted in the lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100,
50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 25 mmol/L h-glycerophosphate, 25 mmol/L NaF, 5 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L EDTA, protease cocktail
inhibitor set III, and phosphatase cocktail inhibitor set II (Calbiochem). The
lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 13,000 rpm for 10 min on ice and
frozen at 80jC. Protein concentrations were determined using the
bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology). Protein extract
(20 Ag per lane) was electrophoresed, transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (Millipore), and probed with specific antisera using

Cell culture. Breast cancer cell lines used in this study were described
in detail previously (13). The serum used throughout the course of
this study was FetalClone III (HyClone), which is not supplemented
with EGF.
Cell growth inhibition assay and data analysis. Cell viability was
determined using the CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega). Cells were treated with
MEK inhibitors CI1040 or U0126 dissolved in DMSO. Nine dilutions of each
drug were made in 1:5 serial dilution. The cell growth was determined using
CellTiter-Glo assay at days 0 and 3 of drug exposure. Growth inhibition was
calculated as described by the National Cancer Institute/NIH Developmental Therapeutics Program7 (14). The 50% growth-inhibiting concentration
(GI50), total growth-inhibiting concentration (TGI), and 50% lethal
concentration (LC50) were calculated using a standardized algorithms.
Drug combination studies were designed according to Chou and Talalay
(15). CalcuSyn software (Biosoft) was used to calculate the combination
index (CI). CI < 1 indicates synergy, a CI about 1 shows an additive effect,
and CI > 1 indicates antagonism. Combined drugs were used at fixed molar
ratios.
Identification of predictors of response to MEK inhibition based on
mRNA expression. SplineMarker (a variant of the linear splines method
allowing for modeling of nonlinear relationships between molecular
markers and response; ref. 16) was used to identify the mRNA predictors
of response to the MEK inhibitors CI1040 and UO126 using existing mRNA
expression profiles from 51 breast cancer cell lines (13). A false discovery
rate of 10% was used to identify transcripts associated with responsiveness
to MEK inhibition. Baseline expression data for the MAPK-related gene
predictors were hierarchically clustered with XCluster8 using a noncentered
metric and Pearson correlation. We visualized the data with Java TreeView.9
Model variables are learned by performing least squares fit between the
molecular profile and sensitivity profile for each molecular variable. In
SplinMarker algorithm, the model is determined via leave-one-out crossvalidation. The goodness of fit is assessed by evaluating a P value
corresponding to the F statistic for the fit (16). P values are corrected for
multiple hypotheses testing using the false discovery rate method (17).
Ingenuity pathway enrichment analysis was performed using the Ingenuity
Knowledge Base Database10 separately for the sensitivity and resistance

standard techniques. Bound antibodies on immunoblots were detected by
enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham).
Cell cycle and apoptosis analyses. Cells were treated with drugs
24 h after plating and harvested for apoptosis or cell cycle assays at
72 h after treatment. Apoptosis was measured in live cells by Annexin
V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) labeling using Apoptosis Detection Kit I
(BD Pharmingen) and quantified by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton
Dickinson) with CellQuest software. For cell cycle analysis, cells were fixed
in 70% ethanol, treated with PI (30 Ag/mL) and RNase A (100 Ag/mL), and
subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Data
analysis was performed using ModFit LT cell cycle analysis software (Verity
Software House). All treatments were done in triplicates and at least 40,000
cells were acquired from every sample for the FACS analysis.

MAPK pathway genes predict responsiveness to MEK
inhibitors in human breast cancer cell lines and tumors. To
identify genes and pathways predicting sensitivity to MEK
inhibitors, we performed a correlation analysis of mRNA expression
data from the cell line panel with the above-mentioned growth
inhibition data. The previously reported mRNA microarray data of
the cell line set were used (13). Using the SplineMarker algorithm,
we identified 1,548 (883) gene transcripts associated with
sensitivity to CI1040 (UO126), and 790 (671) transcripts were
associated with resistance. Among these, 292 and 127 predictors,
associated with sensitivity and resistance, respectively, were
common to both drugs. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed
that the predictive mRNA markers are significantly enriched in four
pathways for U0126 and eight for CI1040 (Supplementary Table S2).
These included ERK/MAPK signaling, purine metabolism, p53
signaling, and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450.
Genes involved in ERK/MAPK signaling were predictive of
sensitivity, whereas PI3K pathway components were associated
with resistance to MEK inhibitors (Fig. 2). Hierarchical cluster
analysis revealed that genes predictive of susceptibility to MEK
inhibitors were relatively overexpressed in basal-type cell lines,
whereas resistance markers were highly expressed in luminal cells
(Fig. 2). A multivariate model of response to CI1040 consisting of 26
mRNA predictors from the Ingenuity MAPK pathway gene set was
confirmed as involved in this pathway by at least one additional
database (KEGG, BioCarta, GeneGo, and GSEA). We trained the
model on a randomly selected set of 31 breast cancer cell lines and
tested the accuracy of the model on the remaining 10 cell lines. The
best model consisted of only one gene (RAC2). The sensitivity
predicted by the model was strongly correlated with the measured
sensitivity on the test set: r = 0.69 (P = 0.027). We applied this

Results
Basal-type breast cancer cell lines are particularly susceptible to MEK inhibition. We ascertained the effect of pharmacologic inhibition of MEK in a large panel of breast cancer cell lines
that was described before (13). Cells were treated with the specific
MEK inhibitors CI1040 or U0126 and cell viability was determined.
A wide spectrum of growth inhibition was observed. For U0126, the
GI50 ranged from 0.8 Amol/L (HCC1187 cells) to 60 Amol/L
(MDAMB231 cells), whereas the GI50 for CI1040-treated cells
ranged from 0.8 Amol/L (SUM229PE) to 33 Amol/L (MDAMB231
cells). Compared with luminal-type cell lines, basal-type breast
cancer cells showed more frequent growth inhibition in response
to MEK inhibitor treatment, particularly following treatment with
CI1040 (Fig. 1; Supplementary Materials and Methods). For the
majority of cell lines, however, the LC50 was not reached. Only
nine cell lines treated with U0126 and eight cell lines treated with
CI1040 were killed at concentrations of equal or less than 50 and
25 Amol/L, respectively (data not shown).

Figure 2. Breast cancer cell lines can be hierarchically clustered according to their expression of the MAPK-related gene predictors. Each row represents the relative
transcript abundance (in log2 space) for one gene; each column represents data from one cell line. Expression of genes in the top panel predicts sensitivity to
MEK inhibitors, whereas expression of those in the bottom panel predicts resistance. Within each panel, genes are ordered by q value. In the top panel, the most
significant predictors are at the top; in the bottom panel, the most significant predictors are at the bottom. In the tree, yellow end nodes denote basal cell lines and pink
end nodes denote luminal cell lines.

markers, was correlated with resistance to MEK inhibitors. These
findings clearly support the notion that basal-type breast cancer
cell lines are particularly susceptible to MEK inhibitors.
Temporal proteomic analysis reveals a novel negative
feedback loop between MEK and PI3K mediated by the EGF
receptor. To further understand the response of signal transduction pathways to MEK inhibition, we analyzed temporal changes in
protein expression and phosphorylation by RPPA technology. As
expected, a strong reduction in phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) levels
in response to MEK inhibitor treatment was observed, along with
down-regulation of effectors of ERK, such as cyclin D1 (Fig. 3A
and B). Additionally, EGF treatment induced phosphorylation of
the EGF receptor (EGFR) and downstream effectors, such as AKT.
Unexpectedly, MEK inhibition led to markedly enhanced phosphorylation of EGFR and activation of the PI3K pathway, as
determined by phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) at S473. We
confirmed key findings by conventional Western blotting in
MDAMB231 and T47D cells using two different MEK inhibitors,
CI1040 and U0126 (Fig. 3C; data not shown), showing that
activation of AKT in response to MEK inhibition is not limited to
a single cell line or a result of off-target effects of one drug.
Overactivation of EGFR and AKT was most striking in the presence

in vitro molecular predictor to forecast sensitivity to CI1040 of
previously reported 118 tumors (21). The model predicted that the
basal tumors are more sensitive to CI1040 than the luminal tumors.
The difference in predicted sensitivities between these two groups
was statistically significant (P = 6.7e 03).
Protein predictors of susceptibility to MEK inhibition.
Because the MAPK pathway is regulated predominantly through
protein modification, particularly phosphorylation, we ascertained
the differences in protein expression levels as predictors of
susceptibility to MEK inhibition in the panel of 53 breast cancer
cell lines by performing Western blot analysis for the detection of
64 proteins. In addition, expression and phosphorylation of 34
proteins was assessed by RPPA technology. Fifteen phosphoproteins common to both approaches were included in the analysis.
The correlation between protein expression levels in the breast
cancer cell panel and GI50 of CI1040 as well as U0126 was
calculated using SplineMarker (Supplementary Table S3). Ten
proteins were significantly correlated with susceptibility to MEK
inhibition for both drugs (Supplementary Table S4). Cytokeratin-5/
6, a well-established marker for the basal breast cancer subtype,
showed the strongest correlation with GI50 of the MEK inhibitors.

lines responding with apoptosis to the dual-inhibitor treatment
harbor wild-type p53, whereas those showing synergistic effects on
cell cycle distribution contain mutant p53.
Cooperative G1 growth arrest results from synergistic
inhibition of cyclin D1. We sought to further understand the cell
cycle effects induced by inhibition of MEK and PI3K and analyzed
the response of proteins downstream of these molecules. This
analysis included mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase,
an important regulator of protein translation. It is required for
activation of S6 kinase (S6K) and 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1),
which regulates cap-dependent mRNA translation. Despite the
inhibition of MEK by CI1040 in MDAMB231 cells, phosphorylation
of both phosphorylated S6K and phosphorylated 4E-BP1 did not
change (Fig. 6B), whereas inhibition of PI3K with PIK90 led to a
significant reduction in S6K phosphorylation and a moderate
inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. The combination of CI1040
and PIK90, in contrast, further inhibited activation of S6K and
caused a marked decrease in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (Fig. 6B).
Expression of cyclin D1, a target of translational regulation by the
mTOR pathway (25), was slightly reduced after MEK inhibition,
whereas treatment with PIK90 led to increased levels at the 24-hour
time point. In contrast, the combination of both inhibitors resulted
in a strong down-regulation of cyclin D1 protein, which was
paralleled by reduction in the corresponding mRNA levels (Fig. 6C).
Thus, regulation of cyclin D1 gene expression drives the expression
levels of cyclin D1 protein, whereas translational regulation plays a
minor role in this context. Indeed, knockdown of cyclin D1
expression by small interfering RNAs resulted in G1 arrest (data
not shown), showing the effect of cyclin D1 levels on G1-S cell cycle
progression in these cells. Based on these data, it seems that cyclin
D1 represents a major intersection point between the RAF-MEKERK and PI3K pathways, mediating cell cycle arrest in response to
pharmacologic inhibition of these pathways. Interestingly, dual
inhibition of PI3K and mTOR (with PIK90 and rapamycin or the dual
PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI103), which acts downstream of both the
MAPK and PI3K pathways, was not sufficient to induce a significant
reduction of cyclin D1 protein or mRNA levels (Fig. 6B and C). Thus,
reduction of MEK-dependent and mTOR-independent regulatory
factors is required for the observed repression of cyclin D1.
MEK inhibition counteracts apoptotic cell death induced by
camptothecin. Because it has been described by others that cells
arresting in the G1 phase of the cell cycle might be protected from
apoptosis induction, we assessed whether MEK inhibition would
alter sensitivity to apoptosis induced by chemotherapy in
MDAMB231 cells. As shown in Fig. 6D, we treated MDAMB231
cells for 1 or 24 hours with CI1040 or DMSO (control) before adding
the chemotherapeutic agent camptothecin, which strongly induces
apoptosis in these cells. In agreement with our prediction,
apoptosis induction was inhibited after 1 hour of CI1040
pretreatment. After 24 hours of pretreatment with CI1040, the
proapoptotic activity of camptothecin was completely abolished.
Thus, MEK inhibition not only did not induce apoptosis but also
acted as a cytoprotective when breast cancer cells were treated
with proapoptotic agents.

of EGF in the medium, as determined by Western blot analysis
(Fig. 4). To test whether the increased phosphorylation of AKT was
dependent on overactivation of EGFR, we treated MDAMB231cells
with the specific EGFR inhibitor gefitinib in the presence or
absence of CI1040. We found that in low serum conditions in the
presence of EGF, MEK inhibitor–induced activation of AKT was
fully abolished by the treatment with gefitinib. In 10% serum, the
effect of gefitinib was still observed, although to a lesser degree. To
rule out that MEK-dependent activation of AKT being a cell line–
specific phenomenon, we assessed p-AKT in eight cell lines treated
with CI1040 under low serum conditions and found increased
p-AKT levels in five cell lines: MDAMB231, T47D, HS578T,
MDAMB175, and Sum149 (Fig. 5A; data not shown). Thus, a
negative regulatory feedback loop exists between MEK and AKT
that depends on activation of the EGFR and thus represents a
signal-amplifying mechanism (Fig. 5B and C).
Synergistic cellular effects of inhibition of MEK and PI3K in
breast cancer cells with feedback activation of AKT. Because
suppression of apoptosis is among the known biological effects
mediated by the PI3K pathway, we hypothesized that the feedback
activation of the pathway in response to MEK inhibition
contributes to resistance of breast cancer cells to MEK inhibitors.
We therefore hypothesized that inhibitors of PI3K should synergize
with MEK inhibitors in cell lines showing feedback activation of
AKT. We tested this using inhibitors of PI3K specific for the p110a
isoform, PIK90 and PI103 (12). This PI3K isoform is frequently
mutated in cancer and a crucial signal transducer in cancer cells
(22–24). Synergistic growth inhibition following PI3K and MEK
inhibition occurred in 4 cell lines out of 11 tested (Fig. 5D). The
calculated CI values ranged from 0.259 (HS578T) to 0.742 (SUM149
cells), which are considered strong and moderate synergism,
respectively. These cell lines had shown strong activation of AKT
following MEK inhibition. However, only MDAMB175 and SUM149
cell lines showed an increase in apoptosis rates when treated with a
combination of MEK and PI3K inhibitors (Supplementary Table S5;
data not shown). In contrast, in other cell lines, including
MDAMB231 cells, the combination of CI1040 or UO126 with PI3K
inhibitors induced a complete G1 arrest (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, cell

A major finding of this study is the particular sensitivity of basaltype cell lines to inhibitors of MEK. This has implications for our
understanding of the role of the MAPK pathway in basal-type
breast cancer as well as for the further development of MEK
inhibitors clinically. The predictive nature of basal-type features
was strongly supported by our analysis of correlation of protein
expression patterns and sensitivity to MEK inhibitors. The most
predictive protein marker was cytokeratin-5/6, a well-established
marker of basal-type breast cancer (27–29). Additional subtypedefining markers were found to be correlated with response to
MEK inhibitors (EGFR with sensitivity, ERa, and cytokeratin-18
with resistance). High expression levels of EGFR and lack of
expression of ERa and cytokeratin-18 are characteristic for basaltype breast cancers (30). Our analysis of gene expression predictors

that these cell lines retain molecular abnormalities characteristic
for human breast cancers (13) and we used this system to define
molecular predictors for susceptibility to lapatinib and for EGFR
and Her2/Neu. These were validated in a clinical study of lapatinib
in combination with paclitaxel.11 Similar approaches were
previously used to identify molecular signatures of susceptibility
to conventional chemotherapeutic agents (26). Thus, the validity of
cell line–based approaches for the preclinical development and
optimization of treatment strategies using targeted therapeutics
has been well established.

MEK Inhibition in Basal-Type Breast Cancer

described before. A negative feedback loop has been shown from
ERK to the Grb2-associated binder 1 protein, a scaffold protein that
propagates EGFR signals to the PI3K and the RAS/MAPK pathways
(34, 35). Because the PI3K pathway is a known promoter of the cell
cycle and negative regulator of apoptosis, we reasoned that
feedback activation of AKT could counteract therapeutically
relevant effects of MEK inhibition. Indeed, dual inhibition of
MEK and PI3K led to synergistic down-regulation of cyclin D1
mRNA and protein levels, as well as growth inhibition in cell lines
showing strong feedback activation of AKT following MEK
inhibition. The role of cyclin D1 in mediating efficacy of MEK
inhibitors is further highlighted by our finding that cyclin D1
protein levels were correlated with resistance to MEK inhibition,
whereas levels of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (a negative regulator
of cyclin D1) were correlated with sensitivity to MEK inhibitors.
Only a subset of our cell lines responded with cell killing to the dual
inhibition, whereas the remainder of cell lines showed synergistic
inhibition of the cell cycle. Similar observations were shown by
others previously (36). It is conceivable that the reduced levels
of E2F1 as a consequence of loss of cyclin D1 expression could
result in protection from apoptosis because known E2F1dependent proapoptotic genes exist that are inhibited by PI3K
(37). The E2F1-driven apoptotic mechanism is p53 dependent.
Interestingly, wild-type p53 is present in cell lines undergoing

of response revealed a strong enrichment of genes encoding for
MAPK pathway components. Furthermore, we found increased
expression of these gene predictors in basal-type cell lines, showing
that basal-type cells use this pathway to a greater extent than
luminal cells and depend on its activity for proliferation.
Interestingly, gene expression of the Rho-like GTPase RAC2 was
highly predictive of responsiveness to MEK inhibition in breast
cancer cell lines and in human tumors. Activation of the MAPK
pathway has been shown as a central feature of basal-type breast
cancers (31). Overexpression of EGFR, amplification and mutation
of the KRAS oncogene, and overexpression of aB-crystallin have
been shown to lead to activation of this pathway in basal-type
breast cancer. aB-crystallin is a MEK-activating heat shock protein
that is overexpressed in basal-type breast cancers and associated
with poor outcome (32). Luminal-type cells might use the MEKERK pathway to a lesser extent and seem to be more dependent on
the PI3K pathway, shown by the preferential occurrence of PI3K
mutations in this subtype (33) and our finding that AKT protein
levels predict resistance to MEK inhibitors.
The role of the PI3K pathway in conferring resistance to MEK
inhibitors is highlighted by our discovery of a negative feedback
loop activating AKT in response to MEK inhibition in an EGFRdependent fashion, thus amplifying EGF signals (Fig. 5B and C).
Cross-talk between the MAPK and PI3K pathways has been

Figure 6. Biological effects of MEK inhibitors in combination with PI3K inhibitors and camptothecin. A, FACS-based analysis was used to determine percentage of
MDAMB231 cells in G1, S, and G2 phases of the cell cycle at 72 h after treatment with the single drugs and with their combinations at indicated doses. Whereas PI3K
inhibitors PIK90 and PI103 do not affect cell cycle distribution, their addition to MEK inhibitors CI1040 or U0126 results in complete G1 arrest. Columns, mean of
duplicates; bars, SD. For each duplicate, 40,000 cells were acquired. The result was confirmed in two independent experiments. B, Representative Western blot
analysis of MDAMB231 cells treated with the indicated drugs and their combinations for 4 or 24 h. The cells were treated with drugs in full serum conditions and
harvested at 4 and 24 h after drug addition for protein and RNA isolation. C, cyclin D1 gene expression changes induced by the same drug treatments as
in panel B: 1, control; 2, CI1040 (5 Amol/L); 3, PIK90 (5 Amol/L); 4, PI103 (0.5 Amol/L); 5, CI1040 + PI103; 6, CI1040 + PIK90; 7, CI1040 + PIK90 + rapamycin;
8, PIK90 + rapamycin; 9, rapamycin (5 nmol/L). Gene expression was analyzed by Taqman assay; the results are averaged from duplicates. Relative cyclin D1
expression is presented as the percentage of that of control (untreated) cells. D, G1 arrest induced by MEK inhibition rescues the cells from apoptosis induced by
cytotoxic agent. MDAMB231 cells were treated with camptothecin (2.5 Amol/L) for 48 h, which resulted in 20% of apoptotic cells. Pretreatment of cells with CI1040 for
1 h reduced the amount of apoptotic cells, whereas pretreatment of cells for 24 h completely eliminated apoptosis induced by camptothecin. Columns, mean of
duplicates; bars, SD. For each duplicate, 40,000 cells were acquired. The results were confirmed in two independent experiments.

and >60% of BRCA1-related breast cancers (38, 39). Currently,
treatment options for these patients are limited and MEK
inhibitors might represent a promising therapy. Furthermore,
inhibiting the MEK-EGFR-PI3K feedback loop is likely to result in
therapeutic synergism, particularly in cases with wild-type p53.

apoptosis following MEK/PI3K inhibition, whereas p53-mutant cell
lines showed synergistic cell cycle arrest. Moreover, in MDAMB231
cells, protection from apoptosis resulted from MEK inhibition in
cells treated with camptothecin. These findings suggest that MEK
inhibition might have antiapoptotic effects and thus counteract
potential therapeutic effects of other agents administered in
combination.
These results are relevant for the design of future clinical trials.
The MEK inhibitors CI1040 and AZD6244 have shown only modest
antitumor activity in early clinical trials (8, 9). In one study that
included breast cancer patients, tumor biopsies showed reduction
of p-ERK levels and reduction of the proliferation marker KI-67 in
tumor biopsies (9). This finding corresponds well with our
observation of predominant cell cycle effects of MEK inhibitors
in breast cancer. Our findings suggest focusing further development efforts of MEK inhibitors in breast cancer on patients with
basal-type cancers, which are representing f15% of all sporadic
