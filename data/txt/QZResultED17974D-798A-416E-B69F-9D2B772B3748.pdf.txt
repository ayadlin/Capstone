BACKGROUND: The authors prospectively assessed anxiety, depression, and behavior in children with standard-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (SR-ALL) during the first year of therapy and identified associated risk factors. METHODS: A cohort study was performed of 159 children (aged 2 years-9.99 years) with SR-ALL who were enrolled on Children’s Oncology Group protocol AALL0331
at 31 sites. Parents completed the Behavior Assessment System for Children, the General Functioning Scale of the Family Assessment
Device, and the Coping Health Inventory for Parents at approximately 1, 6, and 12 months after diagnosis. RESULTS: Overall, mean
scores for anxiety, depression, aggression, and hyperactivity were similar to population norms. However, more children scored in the
at-risk/clinical range for depression than the expected 15% at 1 month (21.7%; P 5.022), 6 months (28.6%; P <.001), and 12 months
(21.1%; P 5.032). For anxiety, more children scored in the at-risk/clinical range at 1 month (25.2% vs 15%; P 5.001), but then reverted
to expected levels. On adjusted analysis, unhealthy family functioning was found to be predictive of anxiety (odds ratio [OR], 2.24;
P 5.033) and depression (OR, 2.40; P 5.008). Hispanic ethnicity was associated with anxiety (OR, 3.35; P 5.009). Worse physical
functioning (P 5.049), unmarried parents (P 5.017), and less reliance on social support (P 5.004) were found to be associated with
depression. Emotional distress at 1 month predicted anxiety (OR, 7.11; P 5.002) and depression (OR, 3.31; P 5.023) at 12 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety is a significant problem in a subpopulation of patients with SR-ALL immediately after diagnosis, whereas
depression remains a significant problem for at least 1 year. Children of Hispanic ethnicity or those with unhealthy family functioning
may be particularly vulnerable. These data suggest that clinicians should screen for anxiety and depression throughout the first year

INTRODUCTION
Greater than 90% of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with standard risk (SR) features will be cured.1
The improved survival rate is, in part, due to more intensive therapies with durations of 2.5 to 3.5 years.2 These therapies
involve multiple different chemotherapeutic agents that can affect the child’s emotional functioning. In particular, corticosteroids, a key component of therapy for ALL, affect mood, behavior, and cognition.3
To our knowledge, the current study is the first prospective, longitudinal study of emotional and behavioral functioning in a large sample of children receiving active treatment for SR-ALL who did not receive cranial radiation.4 Information regarding the behavioral and emotional health of children with cancer is largely based on studies of children after
therapy, rather than those receiving active treatment.5 Those studies have used cross-sectional designs and yielded mixed
results regarding emotional distress in patients with ALL.4,6,7 The few longitudinal studies that are available were small,

In this prospective study of the psychological adjustment of children receiving active therapy for standard-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the authors found
that a significant subpopulation of children displayed symptoms of anxiety and depression that merit intervention. Particularly vulnerable were children of Hispanic descent or those with unhealthy family functioning.

included diverse cancer populations, and/or excluded
patients with ALL who were aged < 5 years.8-10 Variables
associated with children’s psychosocial adjustment
include older age,11,12 female sex,13,14 lower household
income,14 parental distress,14 and more intensive
treatment.12
The contribution of family functioning and coping
behaviors to children’s emotional functioning is of particular interest because there are emerging data that suggest
these factors may be modifiable. For example, a randomized clinical trial among adolescent survivors of childhood
cancer and their families found that a 1-day family-based
intervention improved symptoms of posttraumatic
stress.15 In addition, there is compelling evidence of the
efficacy of family interventions in other childhood illness
populations such as in type 1 diabetes.16
We prospectively evaluated the emotional and behavioral functioning of a large representative sample of
children with ALL who were enrolled on a frontline
Children’s Oncology Group (COG) therapeutic study
during the first year of therapy. We sought to: 1) describe
the longitudinal trajectory of the psychological adjustment of children during their first year of therapy by
measuring symptoms of anxiety, depression, and behavioral disturbances; and 2) identify factors associated with
worse psychological functioning in children, including
potentially modifiable variables related to family functioning and coping that could be targeted in future
interventions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population

We conducted a prospective, longitudinal study of emotional and behavioral outcomes in children with SR-ALL
who were enrolled on the COG AALL0331 protocol
between 2005 and 2009 at 31 sites. We focused on a subset of children who were classified as having average-risk
ALL, defined as SR by National Cancer Institute criteria
(initial white blood cell count < 50,000/lL and aged 1.09.99 years) without central nervous system or testicular
leukemia who had a good early response to therapy based
on bone marrow morphology and minimal residual disease burden at end induction, and other variables.17,18
Additional eligibility requirements for this study of emotional and behavioral outcomes included age  2 years
and at least 1 parent with reading comprehension of English or Spanish, the languages for which validated surveys
exist. The participating sites were chosen from all COG
sites to include a combination of community-based and
1418

tertiary care centers with available staffing for this ancillary study.
Patients received a 3-drug, 4-week induction with
vincristine, pegaspargase, and dexamethasone (at a dose of
6 mg/m2/day 3 28 days), as well as intrathecal chemotherapy. No patient received cranial radiation. There were
2 therapeutic randomizations: 1) standard consolidation
versus intensified consolidation, which added 2 doses of
cyclophosphamide and pegaspargase; and 2) standard interim maintenance with oral methotrexate versus augmented interim maintenance with escalating intravenous
methotrexate as postconsolidation therapy. In 2008, the
second randomization was halted based on the results of
the Children’s Cancer Group-1991 SR-ALL trial.2
A total of 194 patients who were enrolled on
AALL0331 at the participating sites met the eligibility criteria for this ancillary study. Of these, 24 patients declined
and 170 consented to participate. Of those who consented, 4 patients withdrew from the AALL0331 protocol
before the first required survey evaluations and 7 were not
given the evaluations because of errors at the study sites.
The 159 participants (82% of eligible participants) were
similar to the 35 eligible nonparticipants in terms of age at
diagnosis and sex, with some differences in ethnicity
noted (Table 1).
Procedures

The Institutional Review Board of each participating center as well as the Yale University Human Investigation
Committee approved the current study. Informed consent, and assent when indicated, was obtained for all participants. The identified primary caregiver (the child’s
mother in 84% of instances) completed surveys at 3
selected timepoints during the first year of therapy: day 1
of consolidation (approximately 1 month after diagnosis),
the end of the delayed intensification (approximately 6
months after diagnosis), and 6 months after the initiation
of maintenance (approximately 12 months after diagnosis). Of the 159 participants, 145 individuals, 131 individuals, and 136 individuals completed the evaluations at
the first, second, and third timepoints, respectively.
Measures

Emotional and behavioral functioning was assessed by the
Behavioral Assessment System for Children, Second
Edition: Parent Report Scale (BASC-2 PRS), a valid and
reliable instrument that has been used successfully in pediatric oncology populations.19,20 Children aged  8 years
also completed the BASC-2 Self-Report of Personality.
However, only 17 of the children in the current study

(10.7%) were aged at least 8 years at the time of diagnosis,
and therefore there were inadequate data with which to
compare their self-report outcomes. The BASC-2 PRS
yields standardized T-scores on a variety of clinical scales.
Scores of 60 to 69 represent the at-risk range and
scores  70 represent the clinically significant range. The
BASC-2 PRS has been standardized on normative data
obtained from a random sample of 12,350 children who
are representative of the US population based on sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, geographic region, and culture.21 Expected frequencies of elevated scores in the
normative (ie, healthy comparison) population of children are available in the BASC manual.19 For the current
study, the hyperactivity, aggression, anxiety, and depression scales were analyzed. Anxiety and depression are often comorbid conditions, but in this instrument there are
discrete scales for each.
Family functioning was evaluated using the General
Functioning Scale of the Family Assessment Device (FADGF).22 In this 12-item scale, parents indicate the degree to
Cancer

which they believe each statement describes their family
(eg, “We are able to make decisions about how to solve
problems”). Possible scores range from 1 to 4. Scores  2
reflect unhealthy family functioning.22
Family coping was assessed using the Coping Health
Inventory for Parents (CHIP), which has been validated
for children with a variety of chronic illnesses.23 In this
45-item checklist, parents rate how helpful a specific coping behavior is on a 4-point scale ranging from “not helpful” to “extremely helpful.” A higher score on each of the
3 subscales (ie, 1) maintaining family integration and optimism; 2) maintaining social support and self-esteem;
and 3) understanding the medical situation) indicates a
greater reliance on that particular coping pattern, but
there are no normative scores.
Physical functioning was measured by the “pain and
hurt” and “nausea” subscales of the Pediatric Quality of
Life Inventory (PedsQL) 3.0 Cancer Module.24 In this
questionnaire, parents rate how much of a problem each
symptom has been within the past month. Scores are
transformed on a scale from 0 (worst health) to 100 (best
health).
A parent demographic survey included questions
regarding ethnicity, household income, marital status,
maternal education, and family size.
Statistical Analysis

Patient characteristics, including age at diagnosis, sex, race,
and ethnicity, were summarized and compared between
participants and eligible nonparticipants using an exact chisquare test to evaluate the potential for response bias.
The primary outcomes of interest were the BASC-2
PRS subscales for anxiety and depression. The percentages
of patients in the “at least at-risk” and clinical ranges were
compared with the corresponding percentages in the normative population, a comparison group of healthy children, using a 1-sided binomial exact test.
Both univariate and multivariate longitudinal analyses were conducted. For univariate analysis, a logistic
regression model was tested with the dichotomized
BASC-2 PRS scores (ie, elevated vs not elevated scores)
for anxiety and depression as dependent variables, taking
into consideration the dependence of repeated measurements at 3 timepoints for each subject. The following independent variables were analyzed: age at diagnosis, sex,
race and ethnicity, household income, maternal education, marital status, family size, pain and hurt subscale
and nausea subscale, as well as repeated measures of general family functioning and coping behaviors. The multivariate regression modeling included the patient and

family factors that were found to be associated with elevated anxiety and depression scores by univariate analysis
at P < .1. All analyses were performed using SAS statistical
software (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Participants

The participants had a mean age of 4.9 6 2.2 years at the
time of diagnosis; 16.4% were of Hispanic ethnicity and
66.0% had married parents (Table 1).
Frequency of Emotional and Behavioral
Problems

Mean scores for parental report of anxiety, depression,
aggression, and hyperactivity symptoms were stable and
in the average range at all 3 timepoints. However, the frequency of anxiety and depression scores in the at-risk or
clinically significant range was greater than expected compared with the normative population of children (Fig. 1).
At 1 month after diagnosis, a greater percentage of children scored in the at-risk or clinically significant range for
anxiety (25.2% vs 15%; P 5 .001) compared with the
normative population, but then reverted to expected levels
at 6 months (17.5% vs 15%; P 5 .253) and 12 months
(14.2% vs 15%; P 5 .542) after diagnosis. The frequency
of anxiety scores that were elevated to the clinically significant range was greater than expected at 1 month (10.4%
vs 4%; P 5 .001) and 6 months (8.7% vs 4%; P 5 .013)
after diagnosis, but then declined to expected levels by 12
months after diagnosis (4.5% vs 4%; P 5 .448).
For depression, a higher percentage of children had
scores in the at-risk or clinically significant range than
expected throughout the first year of therapy (1 month:
21.7% vs 15% [P 5 .022]; 6 months: 28.6% vs 15%
[P < .001]; and 12 months: 21.1% vs 15% [P 5 .038]).
However, the frequency of depression scores in the clinically significant range was not significantly different from
expected levels at any timepoint (1 month: 5% vs 4%
[P 5 .316]; 6 months: 6.4% vs 4% [P 5 .133]; and 12
months: 6.8% vs 4% [P 5 .087]).
At the 3 timepoints, the percentage of children with
both anxiety and depression scores in the at-risk/clinically
significant range was 12.6%, 15.1%, and 8.3%, respectively. The frequency of elevated hyperactivity and aggression scores was similar to that expected in a normative
population (data not shown).
Longitudinal Analysis

Compared with children with anxiety scores in the average
range, those with anxiety scores in the at-risk/clinically
1420

significant range 1 month after diagnosis were 7.70 times
as likely to have elevated scores 6 months after diagnosis
(95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.39-24.85;
P < .001) and 7.11 times as likely to have elevated scores
12 months after diagnosis (95% CI, 2.08-24.30;
P 5 .002). Children with scores in the at-risk/clinically
significant range 6 months after diagnosis were 20.64
times as likely to have scores in the at-risk/clinically significant range 12 months after diagnosis (95% CI, 6.0270.74; P < .001).
Compared with children with depression scores in
the average range, those with depression scores in the atrisk/clinically significant range 1 month after diagnosis
were 3.51 times as likely to have scores in the at-risk/clinically significant range 6 months after diagnosis (95% CI,
1.33-9.26; P 5 .015) and 3.31 times as likely to have
scores in the at-risk/clinically significant range 12 months
after diagnosis (95% CI, 1.20-9.10; P 5 .023). Children
with scores in the at-risk/clinically significant range 6
months after diagnosis were 5.11 times as likely to have
scores in the at-risk/clinically significant range 12 months
after diagnosis (95% CI, 1.94-13.48; P < .001) (data not
shown).
Predictors of Anxiety and Depression

Table 2 displays the results of the univariate analysis
adjusted for time elapsed since diagnosis. Significant predictors of anxiety and depressive symptoms by parental
report included unhealthy family functioning and less
reliance of each of the 3 coping patterns measured by the
CHIP. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with worse anxiety symptoms, but not depressive symptoms. Conversely,
worse physical functioning as measured by the pain and
hurt subscale of the PedsQL was associated with depression, but not anxiety. There were no differences detected
among the 4 treatment groups.
Table 3 displays the results of a multivariate model,
which included the patient and family factors that were
found to be at least marginally significant (P  .1) on univariate analysis. In this adjusted analysis, Hispanic ethnicity (odds ratio [OR], 3.35; 95% CI, 1.36-8.24) and
unhealthy family functioning (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.074.70) remained significant predictors of worse anxiety
symptoms.
The significant predictors of worse depressive symptoms by adjusted analysis were unhealthy family functioning (OR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.26-4.56), unmarried parents
(OR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.17-4.75), worse physical functioning (P 5 .049), and less reliance on maintaining social
support coping behaviors (P 5 .004).

DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first
prospective, longitudinal study of emotional and behavioral functioning in a large sample of children receiving
active treatment for SR-ALL who did not receive cranial
radiation. Although the majority of children had anxiety
and depression scores similar to those of controls, a significant subpopulation of children displayed symptoms that
merit intervention. We found that depressive symptoms
were a significant problem from the end of the first month
of therapy to 12 months after diagnosis. In contrast, the
frequency of anxiety was elevated at the end of the first
month of therapy, but then declined to levels expected in
a normative population at 6 months and 12 months after
diagnosis. Anxiety and depression scores at 1 month after
diagnosis significantly predicted persistence of symptoms

throughout the first year of therapy. In adjusted analysis,
unhealthy family functioning and self-reported Hispanic
ethnicity were the variables that were found to have the
strongest association with emotional functioning. Children with unhealthy family functioning were 2.24 times
as likely to have anxiety symptoms and 2.40 times as likely
to have depressive symptoms. Hispanic children were
3.35 times as likely as white non-Hispanic children to
have anxiety symptoms, but were not at an increased risk
of depressive symptoms. Age, sex, family socioeconomic
status, and therapeutic randomization did not predict
emotional functioning. We did not find behavioral
changes to be a significant problem.
The current study is unique in that our sample was a
homogeneous group of patients with ALL with a high
expected cure rate who were also enrolled on a randomized

clinical trial. Thus, we were able to account for any differences due to therapeutic randomization. Because we enrolled patients at 31 sites from a range of community and
tertiary care centers and rural and urban regions, the results
of the current study can be generalized more than singleinstitution studies. Furthermore, we had a high participation rate (82% of eligible), which greatly reduced the
potential for selection bias.
Limited published data are available regarding the
longitudinal psychosocial functioning of children currently receiving chemotherapy. The results of the current
study can be most closely compared with the prospective
1422

cohort study of 38 patients by Sawyer et al, who also
found that children experience considerable emotional
distress in the immediate postdiagnosis period.9,25 However, in contrast to the current study, Sawyer et al concluded that by 1 year after diagnosis, children treated for
cancer had psychological functioning similar to that of
children in the community. This other study had a smaller
sample size and included a heterogeneous group of
patients with childhood cancer. A more recent study by
Furlong et al prospectively assessed quality of life in children with SR and high-risk ALL, some of whom received
cranial radiation. Although their outcomes included

global quality-of-life health utilities instead of clinical
measures of psychological functioning, Furlong et al
found that meaningful distress improved throughout
therapy in a pattern similar to the results presented
herein.10 This study also differed from the current one in
that the instrument used (the Health Utilities Index) was
only validated for children aged  5 years, which
excluded > 50% of the SR-ALL sample. The most recent
longitudinal report measured the prevalence and distress
of cancer-related symptoms in children throughout therapy.8 This study, which included parents of 89 children
with different cancer diagnoses, also found that psychological distress improved throughout therapy, but was still
an issue for a subset of children at the end of therapy.
We found that family functioning was an important
predictor of emotional functioning among children with
cancer. To the best of our knowledge, the majority of previous research has focused on family functioning as an
outcome variable. Maurice-Stam et al studied off-therapy
children and found both positive and negative correlations between family functioning and quality of life,

depending on the age of the child.26 In patients with pediatric asthma, family dysfunction has been associated with
children’s mental health.27 The current study used the
FAD-GF, which measures perceived family cohesion and
the ability of family members to communicate with each
other. The results of the current study suggest that families
who demonstrate worse cohesion and communication
should be considered to be at higher risk and be offered
more psychosocial support. There are available psychosocial risk screening measures such as the validated Psychosocial Assessment Tool (PAT2.0), which can integrate
assessments of family functioning.28 Furthermore, family
functioning may be a modifiable variable, and thus the
results of the current study support developing familybased interventions that target family functioning.
An important conclusion of the current study is that
anxiety and depression at 1 month after diagnosis significantly predict the persistence of symptoms throughout
the first year of therapy. Clinicians have long advocated
the importance of addressing acute symptoms as part of
multidisciplinary supportive care during cancer therapy.29

The results of the current study further highlight the importance of the early identification of and intervention
among distressed children to avoid long-term emotional
distress. Previous studies in the general population have
suggested that anxiety in children may result in the later
development of depressive disorders and substance
abuse.30 Studies in non-cancer pediatric populations have
also found that there are inherited factors that contribute
to an individual’s risk of responding to adversity in early
life with depression and anxiety.31 Such stressors can
result in changes in the corticotropin-releasing factor system in genetically predisposed individuals.
Although symptoms of anxiety and depression may
lessen throughout therapy, it is important to recognize the
distress they cause and provide appropriate psychosocial
interventions. The National Institutes of Health State-ofthe-Science Conference on Symptom Management in Cancer: Pain, Depression, and Fatigue concluded that: “All
patients with cancer should have optimal symptom control
from diagnosis throughout the course of illness, regardless
of personal and cultural characteristics.”32 A wealth of psychosocial interventions exists for children with cancer,
including cognitive behavioral therapy, social and recreational activities, and psychoeducational interventions.33
Many interventions use family-based methods, which have
been associated with beneficial outcomes for children.34
Understanding the efficacy of various interventions is an
ongoing area of research.33
The association between Hispanic ethnicity and
anxiety is novel in children with ALL. To make sure this
was not due to a methodological error in using an inappropriate comparison group, we verified that the frequencies of Hispanic children in the BASC-2 PRS normative
comparison group (16.5%-20%) were similar to that in
the current study population group (16.4%).19 There is a
single report that demonstrated poorer emotional functioning in Hispanic children with cancer, but it only
addressed the off-treatment period.35 There are other differences between Hispanic and non-Hispanic children
with ALL, including inferior survival rates in Hispanic
children.1,36 We do not currently have the data available
to explain how Hispanic ethnicity leads to worse psychological functioning; but given these differences, this area
of study deserves further attention.
The current study has some methodological characteristics that should be considered in interpreting the results. First,
some patients enrolled in the study did not complete the evaluations at all the required timepoints due to withdrawals
from the therapeutic study, administrative errors at study
sites, and/or incomplete forms. Second, only parent report
1424

was available for the majority (89.3%) of children in the current study because there was no self-report option of the
BASC-2 available for children aged < 8 years. In fact, to the
best of our knowledge, there are no validated, objective selfreport assessment tools for emotional functioning for children
aged < 5 years and few for those aged 5 to 8 years. Young
children may lack the language abilities to report on and/or
the cognitive capacity to reflect on one’s own behaviors or
feelings. Children as old as 11 years tend to report fewer psychiatric symptoms and are unreliable in reporting about time
factors, such as duration or frequency of symptoms,37 and
therefore collateral information is emphasized.38 Assessing
children of preschool age is typically accomplished through
parent report and observation.39 In addition, we were able to
associate family functioning with emotional functioning, but
we were unable to determine the direction of the association
from our data. It may be that children with better emotional
functioning lessen the burden on their families.
Based on the results of this large, multisite, cohort
study of children treated for SR-ALL, we conclude that
symptoms of depression and anxiety are a significant problem in the immediate postdiagnosis period. Although anxiety symptoms lessen after the first month of therapy,
depressive symptoms appear to persist throughout at least
the first year. We also found that we can identify children at
1 month after diagnosis who are substantially more likely to
have worse psychological functioning throughout the first
year of therapy. These results are highly relevant to pediatric
oncologists who should be screening for clinical levels of anxiety and depression starting in the early postdiagnosis period
for at least 1 year after diagnosis. Furthermore, the results of
the current study highlight high-risk groups who should
receive additional psychosocial support, including children
of Hispanic ethnicity or those with parent-reported unhealthy family functioning. Further studies are needed to develop
evidence-based interventions, including those targeting family functioning and patient subgroups at greatest risk, to prevent and treat anxiety and depression in children with ALL.
