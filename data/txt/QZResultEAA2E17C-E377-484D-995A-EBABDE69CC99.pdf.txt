Disrupting Established Tumor Blood Vessels
An Emerging Therapeutic Strategy for Cancer
Mark J. McKeage, MD, PhD1 and Bruce C. Baguley, PhD2

The unique characteristics of tumor vasculature represent an attractive target that may be exploited by vascular-targeting anticancer agents. A promising strategy involves the selective disruption of established tumor blood vessels
by tumor-vascular disrupting agents (tumor-VDAs), which exhibit antivascular activity, resulting in inhibition of tumor
blood flow and extensive necrosis within the tumor core. The tumor-VDA class can be subdivided into flavonoid compounds, which are related to flavone acetic acid, and tubulin-binding compounds. ASA404, of the flavonoid class, is
the most advanced tumor-VDA in clinical development and has been evaluated preclinically and in several phase 1
and phase 2 studies. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the selective apoptosis of tumor endothelial cells and the
inhibition of tumor blood flow. Synergistic activity was observed with ASA404 and with several chemotherapeutic
agents, particularly taxanes. In clinical trials, compared with chemotherapy alone, ASA404 was tolerated well and
produced improved activity in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer when combined with paclitaxel and carboplatin. Phase 3 clinical trials are ongoing. Selectively targeting established tumor vasculature with tumor-VDAs represents a promising and innovative approach to improving the efficacy of standard anticancer therapies. Cancer

The latest comprehensive global figures indicate that, annually, there are 10.9 million new cancer diagnoses, 6.7 million

deaths from cancer, and 24.6 million individuals alive with cancer (within 5 years of diagnosis).1 Over the coming decades, it is predicted that cancer incidence rates will grow significantly in line with the increasing global elderly population;
therefore, a need exists for new cancer therapeutic agents with improved efficacy that are well tolerated.
A functioning vascular network is critical for the growth and survival of solid tumors, and therapeutic agents that target the unique characteristics of tumor blood vessels represent a novel approach to anticancer therapy.2-6 One class of vascular-targeting therapies at an advanced stage of development comprises antiangiogenic agents,7-11 which predominantly
inhibit the formation of new blood vessels (neovascularization).12-16 A promising alternative vascular-targeting strategy
involves the selective disruption of established tumor vasculature. Studies from 60 to 70 years ago demonstrated that the
mitotic poison colchicine has destructive effects on tumor vasculature; however, its high toxicity prevented its clinical
use.17-19 More recently, it was demonstrated that flavone acetic acid (FAA) has significant antitumor activity, causing tumor blood flow shutdown and hemorrhagic necrosis of murine tumors.20,21 Because of those early studies, several related
agents that target the tumor vasculature currently are in clinical development. Tumor-vascular disrupting agents (tumorVDAs) have a different mechanism of action and tolerability profile from antiangiogenic agents and, thus, may provide an
additional clinical benefit to a wide patient population. In this review, we discuss the development of tumor-VDAs and
their potential as novel cancer treatments. Particular emphasis is given to ASA404 (vadimezan; 5,6-dimethylxanthenone4-acetic acid [DMXAA]; formerly known as AS1404), currently in phase 3 clinical trials for nonsmall cell lung cancer
(NSCLC).

Figure 1. Differences between tumor-vascular disrupting
agents (tumor-VDAs) and antiangiogenic agents are shown.
Antiangiogenic agents predominantly inhibit neovascularization, demonstrating the greatest activity at the tumor periphery and in small tumor masses. Tumor-VDAs cause disruption
of established tumor vasculature, inhibition of tumor blood
flow, and extensive necrosis, particularly within the core of
the tumor.

Proposed Mechanism of Action of
Tumor-Vascular Disrupting Agents
An intact vasculature is critical for tumor growth and survival, enabling the rapid proliferation of tumor cells
by the delivery of oxygen and other nutrients and facilitating the development of metastatic disease.6,22-26 Therefore, the tumor vasculature is an attractive and potentially
valuable target for anticancer therapy. Tumor-VDAs act
by selectively targeting established tumor blood vessels,
inhibiting tumor blood flow, and causing extensive secondary necrosis.27-30 Differences between tumor-VDAs
and antiangiogenic agents are highlighted in Figure 1.
Tumor-VDAs cause the disruption of established tumor
vasculature, ultimately resulting in extensive necrosis at
the tumor core.30-34 Antiangiogenic agents are cytostatic
drugs that target neovascularization, preventing tumor
growth and limiting metastatic potential, and have been
reviewed elsewhere.35,36 The differences between antiangiogenic agents and tumor-VDAs may result in distinct
toxicity profiles, offering potential for their use in combination. Preclinical studies have produced delayed tumor
growth with combinations of tumor-VDAs and antiangiogenic agents compared with single agents alone without additional toxicity.37
Tumor-VDAs may be classified into 2 groups based
on their mechanisms of action. One class of compound is
the tubulin-binding agents, which usually are stilbenes or
heterocyclic compounds that bind at the colchicine binding site.38 These agents selectively target tumor endothelial cells by exploiting their dependence on the tubulin
cytoskeleton to maintain cell shape. After binding, rapid

1860

microtubule depolymerization occurs, leading to disruption of the actin cytoskeleton.39-42 The resulting cytoskeletal rearrangements and selective disruption of the
molecular engagement of the junctional protein vascular
endothelial-cadherin result in rapid changes in endothelial
cell shape and increased vascular permeability followed by
blood flow inhibition and vasoconstriction.26,41,43-48
Tubulin-binding agents that are unrelated structurally to
colchicine also are in development; these agents interact
with the Vinca alkaloid-binding domain and have additional cytotoxic modes of action.49,50 The most clinically
advanced of the tubulin-binding tumor-VDAs are combretastatin A-4 phosphate (CA4P)39,44,51-54 and
AVE8062.46,55,56 Other compounds that are in clinical
development include the second-generation combretastatin OXi4503,57,58 dolastatin 10,59,60 dolastatin-related
peptides,49,50 and various small heterocyclic molecules
that bind at the colchicine site (Table 1).61-67
The second category of compounds is referred to
here as flavonoid tumor-VDAs (see Table 1 for mechanistic and toxicologic comparisons with other tumorVDAs),27,29,68,69 because FAA was the first member of
the class. These agents are distinct structurally and have a
tubulin-independent mechanism of action, and this class
is represented by the FAA analogue ASA404. A dual
mechanism of action has been proposed for flavonoid
tumor-VDAs comprising direct and indirect antivascular
activity (Fig. 2).26,28 Preclinical studies in various tumor
models, including human tumor biopsies, demonstrated
that flavonoid tumor-VDAs directly disrupt the tumor
vasculature by selectively inducing apoptosis in tumor
vascular endothelial cells.27,29,70 This direct effect is dosedependent and is evident within 30 minutes of drug
administration.27,29,70 Tumor endothelial cell death
causes exposure of the basement membrane, rupture of
tumor blood vessels, and extravasation of erythrocytes
into the surrounding tissue.27,29,70 The resulting vascular
damage leads to an accumulation of platelets, triggering
the release of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), and its
hepatic metabolite 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid
(5-HIAA).27,33,71,72 This direct disruption of the tumor
vasculature leads to rapid inhibition of tumor blood
flow.27,29
Preclinical studies have revealed that flavonoid tumor-VDAs disrupt the tumor vasculature indirectly by
increasing intratumoral concentrations of tumor necrosis
factor-a (TNF-a) and other cytokines, including interferon-c and chemokine interferon-inducible protein-10
(IP-10), as well as nitric oxide.28,70,73-80 TNF-a appears

Figure 2. The proposed mechanism of action of flavonoid tumor-vascular disrupting agents (tumor-VDAs) is shown. Tumor blood vessels are susceptible to both the direct and
indirect actions of flavonoid tumor-VDAs, leading to combined effects of vessel disruption, inhibition of blood flow,
and induction of hypoxia; extensive tumor necrosis follows.

to be a major contributor to these indirect effects, inducing vascular collapse and leading to increased vascular permeability and reduced tumor blood flow.33,74,79,81 This
was demonstrated by significant reductions in antivascular
activity in TNF/ or TNF-receptor (TNFR)/ knockout mice.29,81 Preclinical studies indicate that flavonoid
tumor-VDA-induced TNF-a synthesis occurs in situ
within the tumor rather than through circulating TNFa.75 Furthermore, TNF-a activity may be maintained
longer in tumor tissue than in plasma as a result of trapped
TNF-a after vascular collapse, prolonging antivascular
effects.75 Indeed, tumor blood flow inhibition still is evident 24 hours after treatment with flavonoid tumorVDAs.70,77-80 The vascular damage that arises from direct
endothelial damage and cytokine induction deprives
tumors of the oxygen and nutrients necessary for growth
and survival. This leads to extensive necrosis, primarily
within the core of the tumor, leaving a viable rim at the
periphery.26,31,33,44,82-86
Macromolecular
contrast
media-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MMCMMRI) has provided early quantitative estimates of changes
in tumor perfusion after flavonoid tumor-VDA treatment
that demonstrate good correlation with cytokine
induction.87
It is believed that the selectivity of tumor-VDAs
occurs through structural and functional differences
between the tumor vasculature and normal vessels (Fig.
3). Normal vessels are organized structurally and are well
invested with smooth muscle cells and pericytes. How-

developed vessel walls that are invested inadequately with
vascular smooth muscle cells, and they have an abnormal
basement membrane.88-91 The endothelial cell lining frequently is discontinuous, with poor connections between

permeability and high interstitial fluid pressure.92 Tumor
endothelial cells also are shaped irregularly and have weak
cell-to-cell junctions, resulting in an uneven luminal layer
that contributes further toward the leaky nature of tumor
vasculature.93 Tumor blood vessels form a highly disorganized and heterogeneous network that is characterized
by complex branching patterns and a lack of hierarchy.90,91 These blood vessels are irregular in diameter and
shape and are elongated with areas of bulging, blind ends
and sprouts.90,91 Because of these abnormalities, tumor
blood flow often is intermittent and sluggish, with an
inadequate oxygen supply.94-96 Heterogeneous oxygenation levels and areas of hypoxia can arise subsequently
and can limit the effectiveness of conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy.97,98 These differences make the tumor vasculature more susceptible than normal vessels to
the effects of tumor-VDAs.

ment.29 A significant correlation has been identified
between the levels of endothelial cell apoptosis and the
degree of tumor blood flow inhibition.29 These effects
occur before detectable increases in TNF-a levels and,
thus, are part of the direct component of the mechanism
of action. ASA404-induced reductions in vascular perfusion of up to 78% were demonstrated in transplanted colon 38 tumors79 and in human head and neck carcinoma
xenografts80 with significant inhibition (P<.01) of tumor
growth 30 days after treatment.80 Marked increases in tumor vascular permeability also have been observed after
ASA404 treatment using both intravital microscopy70
and extravasation of albumin-Evans Blue complexes (a 4fold increase in permeability).79 Furthermore, ASA404
treatment resulted in significant long-term (60-day) cures
in approximately 80% of tumor-bearing mice compared
with 0% of untreated control mice.70

In Vivo Activity of Flavonoid Tumor-Vascular
Disrupting Agents
ASA404 is the tumor-VDA at the most advanced stage of
clinical development (phase 3 in patients with NSCLC)
and has demonstrated selective antivascular activity in
both preclinical models29 and clinical trials.77 The molecular targets of ASA404 still are being elucidated; however,
it has been established in vitro that ASA404 causes a rapid
reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton of endothelial
cells, leading to the partial dissolution of actin filaments26
and changes in cell shape. The indirect effects of TNF-a
may be attributed to its properties as a vascular-disrupting
agent in its own right, and studies with recombinant
TNF-a have indicated that its effects on solid tumors are
mediated, at least in part, through changes in tumor perfusion.99,100 Key regulators of endothelial permeability
include the Rho family of guanosine triphosphate-hydrolasing enzymes (GTPases), which control actomyosinbased cell contractility and have been implicated in
signaling by several vasoactive substances, including
TNF-a.99,100
A wealth of evidence supports the antitumor activity
of ASA404.101,102 Decreased tumor blood flow was an
early observation,31,103 and Ching and colleagues demonstrated the selective induction of endothelial cell apoptosis
after treatment with ASA404 in murine tumors and in
human tumor biopsies from a phase 1 clinical trial.27 A
12-fold increase in the induction of tumor endothelial cell
apoptosis after ASA404 treatment was demonstrated
compared with untreated tumors, and a 76% inhibition
of tumor blood flow was observed 3 hours after treat-

Combining Therapeutic Strategies
Tumor-VDAs are highly effective against the poorly perfused regions of tumors, causing extensive necrosis at the
tumor core (Fig. 4) but leaving a thin layer of viable cells
at the tumor periphery (Fig. 5).31,34,104 It is believed that
this rim of viable cells survives as a result of the diffusion
of oxygen and nutrients from the surrounding tissues.31,44,51,52,105,106 Vascular density at the tumor periphery is much greater than at the tumor core107 and also
may contribute to peripheral tumor cell survival by permitting residual blood flow after vascular damage.31,44,51,52,105,106 The location of these highly
oxygenated and proliferating cells renders them accessible
and susceptible to conventional anticancer therapies.
Because tumor-VDAs primarily affect the central part of
solid tumors that often are resistant to conventional treatments, these therapeutic strategies may work
synergistically.

Chemotherapy

Preclinical studies on tumor-VDAs combined with
chemotherapy regimens have produced enhanced
antitumor activity compared with chemotherapy alone
without producing a concomitant increase in host toxicity.31,108-110 Tumor-VDA–mediated potentiation of
cytotoxic agents can arise by several different mechanisms.
First, tumor-VDAs can effectively target poorly perfused
regions at the tumor core that become resistant to chemotherapeutic agents because of poor drug delivery.
Decreases in tumor blood flow caused by vascular disruption also may lead to entrapment of chemotherapy agents

changes within the tumor, such as acidosis and hypoxia, as
demonstrated by the enhancement of the activity of melphalan by ASA404.109 The schedule in which chemotherapy and tumor-VDA combinations are administered
should be considered carefully, because vascular collapse
may render tumor cells inaccessible if chemotherapy is
given after tumor-VDAs.108
ASA404 has demonstrated synergy with several chemotherapeutic agents, particularly taxanes.110 The combination of ASA404 with docetaxel or with paclitaxel
extended median growth delay in an early passage mouse
mammary tumor (MDAH-MCa-4) by 42.3 days and
75.6 days, respectively, compared with chemotherapy
alone.110 Preclinical combination studies with paclitaxel
in human NSCLC xenografts have produced greater than
additive activity as well as tumor cures.111,112 In contrast,
no tumor cures were observed when either agent was used
alone.111 Marked potentiation of docetaxel by ASA404
also has been observed in preclinical studies in human
prostate cancer xenografts, resulting in a 43% cure rate
with no increase in host toxicity.113
Radiotherapy

The characteristic features of tumor vasculature,
such as microregional hypoxia, that result from its inadequate and irregular blood supply can induce radiation
resistance.97,98 By killing poorly oxygenated tumor
regions, tumor-VDAs may enhance the efficacy of radiation, providing an ideal companion for radiotherapy.104,114 Preclinical studies of ASA404 indeed have

produced successful combined efficacy with radiation
with more than additive antitumor activity and with no
increase in normal tissue damage.104,114 Like with chemotherapy combinations, the enhanced activity depends on
the delivery schedule. In a murine KHT sarcoma tumor
model, ASA404-enhanced radiation damage depended on
the sequence of and interval between drug treatment and
irradiation, and the greatest antitumor effects were
observed when ASA404 was administered 1 to 3 hours after irradiation.114 The absence of enhanced activity when
ASA404 was given before radiotherapy demonstrates the
importance of the order of administration. The vasculardisrupting effect of ASA404 induces tumor necrosis and
hypoxia, which can lead to increased radiation resistance
in the tumor; treatment with the tumor-VDA postirradiation avoids this potential problem and maximizes
efficacy.104,114
Clinical Development of Flavonoid TumorVascular Disrupting Agents
Both classes of tumor-VDA currently are being developed
in the clinical setting. In phase 1 studies, ASA404 significantly reduced dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging parameters, indicating reductions in
tumor blood flow, over a wide dose range.77 Dose-dependent increases in levels of the biomarker 5-HIAA also
were observed.69,115 5-HIAA is a stable metabolite of serotonin that is released from platelets into plasma after vas-

cular damage and, thus, is a useful clinical biomarker for
the action of antivascular agents.72 The dose-limiting side
effects of ASA404 were visual disturbance, anxiety, urinary incontinence, and tremor (Table 1).68,69 Other common adverse events that were reported in ASA404 phase 1
trials included infusion site pain, headache, tumor pain,
altered taste, and nausea.68,69,115 Hypertension, an
adverse effect frequently associated with therapeutic
agents that target the new and established tumor vasculature,53,116 also was observed in up to 36% of patients
(grade 1 or 2).68,69,115
Because of the synergy observed between tumorVDAs and chemotherapeutic agents in preclinical investigations, ASA404 was evaluated in combination with
paclitaxel and carboplatin (ASA404 plus PC) in a phase 2
study (n ¼ 73). That study demonstrated clinical activity
of ASA404 in both squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC
at <50% of the established maximum tolerated dose.117
The current standard treatment for NSCLC is platinumbased chemotherapy118-120; however, although chemotherapy prolongs survival, most patients with advanced
stage disease die within 2 years.121 ASA404 plus PC
(ASA404 1200 mg/m2, with carboplatin at an area under
the concentration time curve (AUC) of 6 mg/mL per minute plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m2) resulted in an apparent
improvement in a range of efficacy endpoints compared
with standard therapy alone, including the response rate
(RR) (31.3% vs 22.2%), the median time to progression
(TTP) (5.4 months vs 4.4 months), and median survival
(14.0 months vs 8.8 months) (Fig. 6).117 A single-arm
extension trial also was performed (n ¼ 31) to evaluate
the safety and efficacy of ASA404 at 1800 mg/m2 in combination with PC.122 At that dose, the RR was 37.9%
according to independently assessed Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors outcomes and 46.7% according
to the investigators’ assessment. Independent assessment
identified partial responses in 11 patients, 14 patients
with stable disease, and 4 patients with progressive disease.
The median TTP was 5.5 months, and the median overall
survival was 14.9 months.122 A retrospective analysis
using pooled phase 2 data revealed that efficacy was
improved in patients who had both squamous and nonsquamous disease when they received ASA404 plus PC
compared with chemotherapy alone.123 Those data
included the RR (squamous, 40% vs 14.3%; nonsquamous, 31.7% vs 25.0%), the median TTP (squamous, 5.6
months vs 1.6 months; nonsquamous, 5.5 months vs 4.8
months), and median survival (squamous, 10.2 months vs

ABT-751 and TZT-1027.49,50,61 In the phase 2 NSCLC
trial that evaluated ASA404 plus PC, grade 3/4 cardiac
adverse events were observed in 10.8% of patients in the
ASA404 1200 mg/m2 dose group (compared with 2.8%
in the control arm),117 and those events resolved after
treatment discontinuation. Although the incidence of cardiac adverse events was greater in the ASA404 plus PC
group, a causal relation to ASA404 was not established,

1866

and most serious adverse events occurred in patients who
had known cardiovascular disease.117 No grade 3/4 cardiac adverse events were observed in the 1800 mg/m2
ASA404 dose group.122,123 Antiangiogenic agents have
been associated with gastrointestinal perforations, hemorrhage, impaired wound healing, hypertension, and arterial
thromboembolic events.126,127 In clinical trials to date,
impaired wound healing, proteinuria, and arterial thromboembolic events have not been observed with ASA404.
Furthermore, no significant bleeding has been observed
in patients with squamous or nonsquamous lung
cancer.117,122,123
After the promising results obtained in the phase 2
combination therapy studies, the phase 3 Antivascular
Targeted Therapy: Researching ASA404 in Cancer Treatment (ATTRACT-1) trial currently is underway. The
ATTRACT-1 trial will assess 1200 patients who receive
ASA404 (1800 mg/m2) plus PC (200 mg/m2 paclitaxel
plus carboplatin at an AUC of 6 mg/mL per minute) as
first-line therapy for squamous and nonsquamous, chemotherapy-naive, advanced-stage NSCLC (Fig. 7), and the
primary endpoint will be overall survival. The
ATTRACT-2 phase 3 trial, which is evaluating ASA404
combined with docetaxel as second-line therapy for
NSCLC, began in 2009.
Limitations and Caveats
Despite promising early phase results, there are several important limitations and caveats about the potential future
use of tumor-VDAs as a therapeutic strategy for cancer.
Currently, data on their clinical use comes exclusively
from small phase 1/2 clinical trials. Cardiovascular toxicities, possibly related to vascular-disruption mechanisms,
have been observed in some of these early studies. Thus,
phase 3 trials, some of which are ongoing, are needed to
definitively establish the clinical safety and efficacy profiles of this class of agent.
Tumor-VDAs can potentiate the efficacy of standard chemotherapy, radiation, and targeted therapies, but
their combination also may result in unwanted toxicity.
In addition, careful sequencing of treatments is necessary
so that tumor-VDA administration does not antagonize
the effects of the partner treatment(s). Indeed, administering tumor-VDAs as the first agent in a sequence may
reduce tumor blood flow and induce hypoxia, potentially
inhibiting chemotherapy delivery and reducing the
impact of radiotherapy.
In a truly targeted approach to cancer treatment,
predictive biomarkers capable of identifying the patients

who are most likely to benefit from tumor-VDAs would
be available. However, the identification of such biomarkers has not yet been explored and, thus, requires
future attention.
Conclusions and Future Perspectives
There is a need to improve on conventional chemotherapy
regimens in oncology, particularly for patients with
advanced disease. An exciting approach to anticancer therapy that has received significant attention in recent years
is to target the unique characteristics of the tumor vasculature. Tumor-VDAs disrupt the established tumor vasculature, inhibit tumor blood flow, and cause extensive tumor
necrosis. Tumor-VDAs have a mechanism of action different from that of antiangiogenic agents and, thus, are
expected to have distinct activity and tolerability profiles.
Tumor-VDAs are effective against the poorly perfused
regions of tumors, causing extensive necrosis at the tumor
core, an area that is not readily accessible to cytotoxic
agents. Several clinical trials currently are ongoing to evaluate the therapeutic potential of tumor-VDAs in combination with standard therapies. The flavonoid tumorVDA ASA404, in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin, has demonstrated clinical activity as a first-line
treatment in phase 2 studies in patients with NSCLC;
and, in light of those results, this combination currently is
being evaluated in the ATTRACT-1 phase 3 trial. Selectively targeting the established tumor vasculature with
tumor-VDAs provides an innovative approach to improve
the effectiveness of conventional anticancer therapies.
