Abstract
Neovascularization plays a critical role in the growth and
metastatic spread of tumors and involves recruitment of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) from bone marrow
as well as sprouting of preexisting endothelial cells. In this
study, we examined if EPCs could promote tumor angiogenesis
and would be an effective cellular target for an angiogenesis
inhibitor, the recombinant kringle domain of tissue-type plasminogen activator (TK1-2). When TK1-2 was applied in the
ex vivo culture of EPCs isolated from human cord blood,
TK1-2 inhibited adhesive differentiation of mononuclear
EPCs into endothelial-like cells. In addition, it inhibited the
migration of ex vivo cultivated EPCs and also inhibited their
adhesion to fibronectin matrix or endothelial cell monolayer.
When A549 cancer cells were coimplanted along with
ex vivo cultivated EPCs s.c. in nude mice, the tumor growth
was increased. However, the tumor growth and the vascular
density of tumor tissues increased by coimplanted EPCs were
decreased upon TK1-2 treatment. Accordingly, TK1-2 treatment reduced the remaining number of EPCs in tumor tissues
and their incorporation into the host vascular channels. In
addition, overall expression levels of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) and von Willebrand factor in tumor
tissues were decreased upon TK1-2 treatment. Interestingly,
strong VEGF expression by implanted EPCs was decreased by
TK1-2. Finally, we confirmed in vitro that TK1-2 inhibited
VEGF secretion of EPCs. TK1-2 also inhibited endothelial cell
proliferation and migration induced by the conditioned
medium of EPCs. Therefore, we concluded that EPCs, as well
as mature endothelial cells, could be an important target of
TK1-2. [Cancer Res 2007;67(10):4851–9]

Introduction
Neovascularization is required for the growth and spread of
tumors, which recruit neighboring vessels and vascular endothelial
cells to support their own blood supply (1, 2). Due to these
characteristics of tumors, inhibition of tumor-induced neovascularization has been an effective anticancer approach. Recently, the

existence of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) in the
adult has been suggested (3–8) and increasing body of evidence has
indicated that neovascularization involves the recruitment of EPCs
as well as endothelial cells to tumor vasculature (6, 9, 10). Circulating EPCs are mobilized from the bone marrow into the
bloodstream and contribute to new blood vessel formation during
tissue ischemia, vascular trauma, and tumor growth (6, 11, 12).
Clinical studies using EPCs have been started for neovascularization of ischemic organs (13, 14). Transplantation of ex vivo
cultivated EPCs has been also reported to contribute to therapeutic
neovascularization (15, 16) and home to the angiogenic tumor vasculature (17). Recently, EPCs or EPC-like cells have been proposed
to improve angiogenesis by secretion of angiogenic cytokines,
which might activate adjacent endothelial cells (18, 19). In this
context, the modulation of recruitment and differentiation of these
cells may be an efficient target for tumor angiogenesis.
Although the evidence that EPCs promote tissue repair is strong,
the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying EPC recruitment and differentiation are not yet understood. Recruitment
and incorporation of EPCs require a coordinated sequence of
multistep events, including adhesion, migration, chemoattraction,
and differentiation to endothelial cells (20). In embryonic EPCs,
such multistep has been visually captured and defined (21). More
recently, bone marrow–derived CD34+ cells of human species also
showed a4h1-mediated attachment to endothelial cells at tumor
periphery and then migration into tumor tissues (22). These studies
suggest several inhibition targets of EPCs. In fact, some inhibitors
have been tested for their effects on EPC mobilization or in vitro
differentiation. For an example, endostatin has been found to
inhibit mobilization of circulating EPCs from bone marrow in
mice bearing lymphoma xenografts (23) and vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF)–induced mobilization of EPCs (24). Interestingly, angiostatin more sensitively inhibits human EPCs than
mature endothelial cells in vitro (25). Previously, we have identified
TK1-2, the recombinant two-kringle domain of tissue-type
plasminogen activator, as an angiogenesis inhibitor with kringle
architecture despite of low sequence identity with angiostatin (26).
It also suppresses tumor growth in vivo in xenograft animal
models of lung and colon cancers (27, 28). Until now, the exact
molecular and cellular mechanism of this fragment remains
unclear. Although antiangiogenic molecules specifically target
endothelial cells, their effects on EPCs are largely unknown.
Therefore, we have examined the effects of TK1-2 on EPCs in vitro
and in vivo by using ex vivo cultivated EPCs more likely to commit
to endothelial-like cells, and an A549 xenografted animal model
coinjected with cultured EPCs, to investigate their effects on the
process of vascular formation in tumor tissue rather than the
mobilization process.

Materials and Methods
Ex vivo cultivation of EPCs from cord blood. The institutional review
board at the Catholic University of Korea College of Medicine approved all
protocols. Cord blood (80–100 mL) was obtained from donors with
informed consent. Mononuclear cells (MNC) were isolated from the cord
blood using the Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation method as
described before (29). Isolated MNCs (1  107 cells per well) were plated
into a six-well plate coated with 0.1 mg/mL human fibronectin (Sigma) and
incubated for 3 days. After that, nonadherent cells were removed and
selected adherent cells were maintained in M199 medium supplemented
with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life Technologies), 30 Ag/mL endothelial
cell growth supplements (Sigma), 90 Ag/mL heparin (Sigma), and 1%
antibiotics for 3 to 4 days.
Cell culture. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were
isolated and cultured as described before (26). Human lung cancer A549
cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1%
antibiotics.
Treatment of TK1-2 under ex vivo culture condition. Yeast-derived
TK1-2 was prepared by expression in Pichia pastoris as previously described
(27). Isolated MNCs were incubated with TK1-2 at the indicated
concentration for 30 min and then plated on eight-chamber wells coated
with fibronectin (2,500 cells/mm2). Then, the cells were incubated in M199
supplemented with 10% FBS and 90 Ag/mL heparin. After 3 days of culture,
nonadherent cells were removed by washing with PBS, and new medium
and TK1-2 were again added to each well. The culture was maintained
through 7 days and examined for cell number and shape. Four randomly
selected fields per well were evaluated.
To confirm EPC phenotypes, binding of FITC-labeled Ulex europaeus
agglutinin 1 (UEA-1) and ac-LDL uptake of adherent cells were also
determined at day 7 as described before (29).
Cell-cell adhesion. HUVECs were seeded in 48-well plates by adding
2.5  104 cells per well 24 h before this assay. Confluent HUVEC monolayers
were stimulated for 12 h with endothelial growth medium-2 SingleQuots
(EGM-2 SingleQuots) containing endothelial basal medium-2 (EBM-2), 2%
FBS, and growth factors. Ex vivo cultivated EPCs ( for 7 days) were labeled
with CM-1,1¶-dioctadecyl-3,3,3¶,3¶-tetramethyliodocarbocyanine (CM-DiI;
Molecular Probe) at a concentration of 2.5 Ag/mL in PBS for 5 min at
37jC and for 15 min at 4jC. DiI-labeled EPCs (1  105/well) preincubated
with TK1-2 for 30 min were added to the HUVEC monolayers. After 3 h of
incubation (37jC), the plates were washed twice with EBM-2 to remove
nonadherent cells. The DiI-labeled EPCs adhering to HUVEC layer were
quantified in triplicates.
Cell-matrix adhesion. Ninety-six–well plates were coated overnight
(4jC) with 0.1 mg/mL fibronectin and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature. Ex vivo cultivated EPCs ( for 7 days)
preincubated with TK1-2 in M199 medium at the indicated concentrations
for 30 min were seeded at 8  103 cells per well. After removal of nonadherent cells by two washing steps, adhesion was quantified in triplicate
by counting adherent cells in four randomly selected fields per well.
Migration. Migration was measured by a modified Boyden chamber
assay using a 48-well chemotaxis chamber (Neuroprobe, Inc.). After ex vivo
cultivated EPCs ( for 7 days) were detached by 1 mmol/L EDTA and
suspended in M199 medium, 5  104 cells in 56 AL of serum-free medium
were incubated with TK1-2 for 30 min and then added to each well in the
upper chamber. The filter was placed over a 48-well bottom chamber
containing 10 ng/mL of VEGF in serum-free M199 with 0.1% BSA. The
assembled chamber was incubated for 6 h at 37jC with 5% CO2 to allow
cells to migrate through the filter. The membrane was removed from the
chamber and stained with Diff-Quik solution (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan).
Nonmigrated cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed.
The number of migrated cells was counted in random five fields (200) of
each well. Each experiment was done in triplicate.
The conditioned medium was prepared by incubating 4-day-old EPCs in
1% FBS-containing M199 medium for 3 days, and then filled in bottom
chambers. For testing inhibitory activity, HUVECs were preincubated with
TK1-2, VEGF-neutralizing antibody (5 Ag/mL, anti-human VEGF polyclonal
antibody, R&D Systems), or control isotype IgG (5 Ag/mL; Zymed), in M199

medium in an incubator for 30 min before being added to the upper
chamber.
Animal studies. Six-week-old male mice (BALB/c Slc-nu/nu; Japan SLC)
were s.c. implanted at the right flank with A549 cells (1  107) alone or
along with ex vivo cultivated EPCs (1  106). Before implantation, ex vivo
cultivated EPCs ( for 5–7 days) were obtained from the blood of several
donors to have enough number of the cultured cells for the animal study.
Then, they were pooled and labeled with PKH26 red (Sigma) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Three days after implantation, the mice of
the treatment group were injected i.p. every day for 17 days with TK1-2
protein (30 mg/kg), whereas control groups of mice were injected with
sterile PBS. The size of tumor in all groups was measured every 2 days using
a caliper, and the volume of tumors was determined using the formula
width2  length  0.52. Institutional guidelines for animal welfare and
experimental conduct were followed.
For the second experiment, nonlabeled EPCs were coimplanted and the
mice (A549, A549+EPC) were treated with TK1-2 for a longer period to
evaluate the effect of TK1-2 on EPC kinetics for tumor growth. All the other
experiment details were carried out identically to the above experiment,
except increasing the dose of TK1-2 from 30 to 50 mg/kg/d after 24 days of
treatment.
Histologic and immunohistochemical analysis. This analysis was
done as described before (27). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against human
von Willebrand factor (vWF; DAKO) and mouse monoclonal antibody
against human VEGF (clone 26503, R&D Systems) were used. The negative
control study for immunohistochemistry was done simultaneously without
each antibody.
Immunofluorescent staining. For cryosectioning, the tumors were fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde, incubated in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4jC,
embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (Tissue-Tek; Sakura
Finetek Europe), and frozen at 70jC. Tissue sections, cut with cryostat
(Leica CM1800) at a thickness of 8 Am and dried on glass slides, were rinsed
in PBS and then blocked with 10% normal goat serum/0.3% Triton-X in
PBS for 1 h. Tissue sections were incubated with mouse anti-human
VE-cadherin monoclonal antibody (clone BV6, Chemicon) or human VEGF
specific polyclonal goat antibody (R&D Systems) as primary antibodies
overnight at 4jC. Samples were washed and incubated with FITCconjugated anti-mouse or conjugated anti-goat antibodies (Molecular
Probes) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were treated with
biotinylated Bandeira simplicifolia lectin B4 (Vector Laboratories) and then
with fluorescein streptavidin to identify murine endothelial cells according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Finally, the sample was rinsed in PBS
and mounted (DABCO; Sigma). Figures were taken using an inverted
fluorescent microscope.
Digital image analysis. The digital images were analyzed as previously
described (30). Digital images were acquired from Olympus AX70
fluorescence microscope using DP70 camera via DP Manger version 2, 1,
1, 163 software (Olympus) and stored as TIFF files. The PKH26-labeled cells
were identified by red fluorescence, and B. simplicifolia lectin B4–binding
cells were identified by green fluorescence. Fields were chosen randomly
from various section levels to ensure objectivity of sampling. Images were
analyzed in Adobe Photoshop (Adobe, Inc.) or ImageJ v.1.34s.3 The fraction
of PKH26 (red) positive pixels or B. simplicifolia lectin B4 (green) positive
pixels was binarized to black and white and a common threshold was set
such that correct vascular morphology was represented with a minimum
background noise. The percentage of white pixels, representing each
positive staining, was determined by histogram analysis [fluorescence
intensities ranging from black (0) to white (255)]. B. simplicifolia lectin
B4–stained images were further analyzed to investigate the changes in
vessel architecture using ImageJ software. Images were skeletonized, which
reduced all vessels to a single pixel width. Total length of vessels was
determined.
Data and statistical analysis. All data are presented as mean F SE.
In vitro experiments were done in triplicate. Statistical significance was

evaluated by means of Sigma plot t test. P < 0.05 was regarded as being
statistically significant.
ELISA for VEGF levels. The MNCs (4  106 cells per well, six-well plate)
were incubated under ex vivo culture condition for 4 days and then floating
cells were removed by washing with PBS. Then, the remaining adherent
cells were incubated in M199 containing 1% FBS. To assess whether TK1-2
itself inhibits VEGF secretion of EPCs, TK1-2 was added to the medium of a
treatment group. After 3 days, only the culture medium was stored at
70jC, after being filtered with a 0.22-Am filter. Before the assay, the
conditioned medium was concentrated five times using Centricon YM3
(Millipore). The concentrated medium (200 AL) was added into the VEGF
antibody precoated 96-well plates and VEGF levels were measured by a
VEGF ELISA kit (DVE00, R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Proliferation assay. Proliferation assay was done using the conditioned
medium from EPC culture by a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay as
described before (26). HUVECs were stimulated by the conditioned
medium (1) or VEGF 10 ng/mL in the absence or presence of TK1-2
(0.5 or 1 Amol/L) or in the presence of VEGF-neutralizing antibody or
isotype IgG antibody (5 Ag/mL).
Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis for tumor tissues was done
as described before (31).

Results
TK1-2 inhibits in vitro adhesive differentiation of EPCs. In
the previous studies, we confirmed that total MNCs isolated from
human cord blood give rise to spindle-shaped and endothelial-like
cells when cultured on a fibronectin matrix in M199 containing
10% to 20% FBS for 7 days (29, 32). EPCs were characterized as
adherent cells double positive for DiI-ac-LDL uptake and UEA-1
lectin binding. We also showed by immunocytochemistry that
cultured EPCs express several important endothelial lineage
markers, including CD31, VE-cadherin, vWF, and KDR/Flk-1. Using
this established culture system, we examined whether TK1-2 affects
the differentiation of EPCs, which exist in a subfraction of MNCs of
human cord blood.
Incubation of isolated MNCs with TK1-2 on fibronectin matrix
for 7 days decreased the number of adherent cells in a dosedependent fashion (Fig. 1A). Most of the adherent cells of untreated
group are spindle shaped, whereas the adherent cells treated with
TK1-2 changed their cell morphology into round shape at high
concentrations (Fig. 1B). In addition, the number of adherent cells
double-positive for ac-LDL(+)-lectin(+) (yellow) was also decreased
dose-dependently (Fig. 1A). The double-positive cells significantly
reduced at 0.1 Amol/L, and IC50 was f1 Amol/L. Because TK1-2
did not induce cell death against MNCs and cultured EPCs in vitro
(Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B), these results indicate that
TK1-2 inhibits adhesion of early undifferentiated EPCs, a subset of
MNCs, on matrix, thereby inhibiting their adhesive differentiation
into endothelial-like cells.
Inhibition of ex vivo cultivated EPC functions by TK1-2.
Because EPCs exist in MNCs at a very low ratio and their pure
isolation is technically unapproachable, we examined the inhibitory activity of TK1-2 further using ex vivo cultivated EPCs, which
are partially selected on fibronectin-coated dishes. Before a migration assay, we confirmed that ex vivo cultivated EPCs expressed
VEGFR-2 (KDR) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and
immunostaining (data not shown) and that EPC migration was
induced dose dependently by VEGF. Inhibition assays were
conducted using 10 ng/mL of VEGF allowing maximum migration
of EPCs. As shown in Fig. 2A, TK1-2 effectively inhibited ex vivo
cultivated EPC migration induced by VEGF in a dose-dependent
manner at a concentration range of 0.05 to 0.5 Amol/L.

Next, we assessed whether TK1-2 inhibits the adhesion of ex vivo
cultivated EPCs to activated endothelial cells, or to extracellular
matrix, fibronectin. Fibronectin has been reported to be expressed
at a high level at the endothelium of tumor periphery in a breast
cancer xenografted model (22). When the cultured EPCs were
incubated on fibronectin-coated plates for 30 min after pretreatment of TK1-2, a significant decrease in the number of adherent
cells was observed upon TK1-2 treatment (Fig. 2B). The number of
adherent cells decreased dose dependently, and a maximal effect
was achieved at 2 Amol/L (at >2 Amol/L, no significant difference
was noted in the number of adherent EPCs). We also investigated
whether TK1-2 could affect adhesion of EPCs to endothelial cell
monolayer. The HUVECs activated with serum and growth factors
showed the increased adhesion of EPCs to a greater extent than
quiescent HUVECs, whereas the addition of TK1-2 significantly
inhibited EPC adhesion to HUVECs dose dependently (Fig. 2C).
Therefore, all the results show that TK1-2 effectively inhibits the
important functions for vessel formation, migration, and adhesion
of ex vivo cultivated EPCs.
In vivo tumor growth and angiogenesis are enhanced by
ex vivo cultivated EPCs and inhibited by TK1-2. On the basis of
the in vitro experiment results, we set out the in vivo experiment
whether TK1-2 inhibits the contribution of ex vivo cultivated EPCs
to tumor neovascularization and growth. Ex vivo cultivated EPCs
were labeled with a red fluorescent cell tracking dye (PKH26) and
coinjected with A549 cancer cells to the flank of nude mice. In this

model, TK1-2 was systemically administered 3 days after implantation. Figure 3A shows each animal group and a period of TK1-2
treatment, and Fig. 3B indicates relative tumor growth for each
group. TK1-2 treatment group showed inhibition of tumor growth
compared with the control and EPC-coinjected control groups,
corresponding to the antitumor effects of TK1-2 reported
previously (27). The tumor growth seemed to be slightly promoted
by EPC coimplantation. However, due to the limitation of
experimental period, significant promotion of tumor growth by
EPCs at later time points could not be observed. On the day 19 of
implantation, we observed that average tumor volume in mice of
TK1-2 treatment was f330 F 58 mm3 compared with 657 F

95 mm3 in control group (P < 0.05) and 735 F 122 mm3 in the EPCcoinjected group (P < 0.05). Thus, TK1-2 treatment decreased
tumor growth by f55% compared with EPC-coinjected group.
When we evaluated vessel density of tumor tissues of each group
by staining host vessels with B. simplicifolia lectin B4, the coimplantation with cultured EPCs led to increase of vessel density,
whereas TK1-2 treatment markedly reduced the increment of host
vessel number (Table 1; Fig. 3C). Although the same number of
cultured EPCs was coimplanted, the number of EPCs residing in
tumor tissues on day 19 was also decreased upon TK1-2 treatment (Fig. 3D). A representative fluorescent microscopic feature
of A549 + EPC tumor showed peripherally scattered EPCs in red
(Supplementary Fig. S2). The central part of tumor tissue was
almost acellular and fibrosed with sparce EPCs. PKH26-labeled
EPCs were rarely incorporated into the vessels found in the core of
the tumors; rather, they were usually incorporated into the
peripheral vessels. Some labeled cells exist around vessels, not
incorporating into the vasculatures. In the EPC-coinjected control
group, the implanted EPCs were well aggregated and spread to
form vascular channels, which were clearly incorporated with host
vessels (Fig. 4A). However, in the case of EPC coimplantation
followed by TK1-2 treatment, the remaining cell number of EPCs
until day 19 was much less than the nontreated group, and the
EPCs were poorly incorporated into the host vascular channels
compared with the nontreated group. The TK1-2–treated group
showed relatively scattered EPCs in the parenchymal tumor tissue,
whereas the nontreated group showed highly aggregated EPCs. The
latter was more likely to form vessels than the former (Figs. 3D and
4A). The PKH26-labeled cells in the tumor tissues were stained
with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and costained with human
specific anti–VE-cadherin antibody, showing that the labeled cells
were human type–cultivated EPCs (Fig. 4A). The PKH26-labeled
cells were also detected as a part of the tumor vessels that were
host derived and stained with mouse vessel–specific B. simplicifolia
lectin B4.
After EPC coimplantation, the tumor tissue showed numerous
EPCs incorporated into vessels and also showed increased positive
reaction of VEGF (Fig. 4B). The VEGF expression was strongly
detected usually around the incorporated EPCs (Fig. 4C). In the
control group (without EPC coimplantation), there was slight
VEGF staining in tumor tissues by immunofluorescent method but
not enough to notify (data not shown). Such strong expression by
the incorporated EPCs was reduced by TK1-2 treatment, in part,
through the decreased number of residing EPCs or by still
unknown mechanisms (Fig. 4C). Accordingly, vWF staining of
human and murine endothelial cells also showed the decrement of
positive reaction upon TK1-2 treatment (Fig. 4B), indicating again
that TK1-2 inhibits neovascularization in tumors. In addition,
TK1-2 treatment increased the terminal deoxyribonucleotide
transferase–mediated nick-end labeling–positive cells in tumor
tissues compared nontreated two control groups, corresponding to
the previous results that TK1-2 or PK1-3 induced apoptosis in
tumor tissues (refs. 27, 28, 31; Supplementary Fig. S3). However,
we were not able to detect whether TK1-2 induced apoptosis in
EPCs in vivo.
In a second set of experiments, nonlabeled EPCs were used for
the coimplantation with A549 cancer cells and tumor-bearing mice
were treated for a longer period; in an attempt to compare the
efficacy of TK1-2 between two groups, A549-only and A549 + EPC
groups. In this experiment, the growth rate of A549-only control
group was slow compared with the previous experiment. Although

Figure 3. TK1-2 inhibits tumor growth and vessel formation in an A549 xenograft model coinjected with ex vivo cultivated EPCs. A, mice were injected s.c. with
either 1  107 tumor cells or a mixture of 1  107 A549 cells and 1  106 PKH26-labeled EPCs. After 3 d, the mice were i.p. administered with PBS (control) or
30 mg/kg recombinant TK1-2 daily for 17 d. B, tumor volume of each group was measured. *, P < 0.05, A549 control versus TK1-2 treatment; **, P < 0.05, A549 + EPC
control versus TK1-2 treatment. C, B. simplicifolia lectin B4 staining of tumor tissues of each group was done to stain the murine, host vessels. Only the green
fluorescence was captured for B. simplicifolia lectin B4. D, implanted, red fluorescent EPCs of each tumor tissue were photographed and counted. No fluorescent
cells were detected in control group. Fields were chosen randomly from various section levels to ensure objectivity of sampling. Images were analyzed in Adobe
Photoshop or ImageJ v.1.34s. The fraction of PKH26 (red )–positive pixels or B. simplicifolia lectin B4 (green )–positive pixels was binarized to black and white, and a
common threshold was set such that correct vascular morphology was represented with a minimum of background noise. *, P < 0.05.

the same number of the cultured EPCs was implanted, the
enhancement of tumor growth by EPCs was more significant on
day 31 compared with that by labeled EPCs (Figs. 3 and 5).
Although PKH26 is being used to monitor cell division, the process

of staining cells with PKH26 seemed to affect EPC activities.
Therefore, in the case of A549 + EPC group, suppression level
of tumor growth by TK1-2 was lower on day 25 (33% suppression
with no significance) compared with the above data (55%) when

of tumor tissues dissected from the mice.
A, red fluorescent signals indicate the
localization of coimplanted labeled EPCs.
Several strongly positive PKH26-labeled
cells covering the luminal surface were
detected in animals injected with ex vivo
cultivated EPCs. Sections were labeled
with green fluorescent monoclonal
anti-human VE-cadherin to visualize
implanted EPCs. Red cells were consistent
with green cells in overlay image.
PKH26-labeled cells were also shown to
incorporate into the B. simplicifolia lectin
B4–stained host vessels. B, tumors

monoclonal antibodies against
VEGF and polyclonal antibody against

tumor tissue. The tumor tissue implanted
with EPCs and followed by TK1-2
treatment showed more loosely arranged
parenchymal tumor cells and less
immunoreactions of VEGF and vWF
(arrows ) compared with the control and
EPC coimplanted tumors. vWF staining of
human and murine endothelial cells also
showed the decrement of positive reaction
upon TK1-2 treatment. C, after EPC
coimplantation, the tumor tissue containing
numerous EPCs incorporated in vessels

VEGF. VEGF expression was detected
strongly around the incorporated
EPCs. Such strong expression by the
incorporated EPCs was inhibited by TK1-2
treatment.

tumor-bearing mice were administered at a dose of 30 mg/kg/d.
However, when the dose was increased to 50 mg/kg/d from day 25
to day 30, the inhibitor effect of TK1-2 seemed significant on day 31
after 6 days of treatment (36%). TK1-2 suppressed more potently
the growth of A549-only tumors (43%). The Western blot analysis of
the tumor tissues obtained from this experiment also showed
that EPC coimplantation increases VEGF expression, whereas
TK1-2 potently suppressed VEGF expression in the tumor tissues
of A549 and A549 + EPC groups, corresponding to the previous
immunohistochemical data of the above-labeled EPC coimplantation experiment. In addition, the tissue extracts of tumors showed
markedly contrast red colors due to the different levels of

TK1-2 inhibits VEGF secretion from EPCs and conditioned
medium–induced endothelial cell functions. From the immunohistochemical analysis of tumor tissues, we found that TK1-2
administration resulted in down-regulation of VEGF expression in
A549 tumor tissues and such effect was especially accentuated in
the coimplanted EPCs, which expressed VEGF at a higher level
than the tumor cells in vivo. Thus, we examined if TK1-2 would
directly inhibit VEGF expression in EPCs using ex vivo cultivation
system. Indeed, the level of VEGF in the 5 conditioned medium

secreted by EPCs was f230 pg/mL by an ELISA assay, and such
VEGF secretion from EPCs was decreased upon TK1-2 treatment
at 1 Amol/L (Fig. 6A).
Because EPCs seem to promote tumor growth by expression
and secretion of VEGF and other factors, we tested if TK1-2 could
inhibit endothelial functions induced by EPC-derived growth
factors. In a thymidine incorporation assay, TK1-2 dose dependently
suppressed endothelial cell growth induced by the conditioned
medium of EPCs (Fig. 6B). Neutralizing antibody against VEGF, but
not isotype IgG control, also inhibited such endothelial cell growth,
indicating that one of the major EPC-derived growth factors is
VEGF. The endothelial cell growth was profoundly increased by the
conditioned medium (3.2-fold) compared with single treatment
of VEGF (10 ng/mL). Considering the concentration of VEGF
(f50 pg/mL) in the conditioned medium (1), other growth
factors derived from EPCs also seemed to promote endothelial cell
growth potently and their stimulating activities might be also
effectively inhibited by TK1-2. Next, the endothelial cell migration
using the conditioned medium of EPCs was examined in a Boyden
chamber migration assay. We found that TK1-2 also dose dependently inhibited HUVEC migration induced by the conditioned
medium. In the same setting, VEGF-neutralizing antibody could
inhibit HUVEC migration induced by the conditioned medium,
but not isotype IgG control (Fig. 6C). Thus, these results suggest
that TK1-2 does not only inhibit VEGF secretion from EPCs, but

of 50 mg/kg for another 6 d. The tumor volume was compared on day 25

also effectively inhibits endothelial functions induced by growth
factors (i.e., VEGF derived from EPCs).

Discussion
Although there were some discrepancies already reported, the
role of EPCs in vessel formation in adult ischemia and tumor has
become widely accepted (9). CD34+ cells, or CD133+ cells have been
used as a fraction more selective for EPCs in experimental studies.
However, CD34 cells, CD34/CD14+, or CD14 cells have been
claimed for exhibiting incorporation into neovasculature in
ischemic tissues (33, 34). In case of CD14+ cells, without ex vivo
expansion, no functional improvement of neovascularization was
detected in ischemic tissues (34). Thus far, although the identity
of EPCs has not been clear yet, the ex vivo cultivated EPCs, which
already commit to differentiation at some levels, have been also
proved to contribute to tumor vessel formation (17, 35). Ex vivo
cultivated EPCs derived from MNCs of human peripheral blood or
cord blood have been successfully shown to incorporate into
neovasculature and contribute to functional recovery of ischemic
tissue (15, 16). In this study, we have shown that ex vivo cultivated
EPCs derived from human cord blood contributed to new vessel
formation in tumor tissues of A549 xenografted mice, when
coinjected with cancer cells. In addition, we also confirmed that
EPC implantation promotes tumor growth through de novo
angiogenesis. Finally, through this model, we found that TK1-2
inhibits the multisteps of vessel formation by EPCs and more
importantly suppresses the VEGF expression of EPCs.
Angiostatin, with similar structure to TK1-2, was found to inhibit
human EPC growth in culture by 75%, while having no effect on
endothelial cell growth (25). However, in this study, an in vivo
demonstration of angiostatin inhibiting vasculogenesis in a vasculogenic tumor model was lacking. Another naturally occurring endostatin has been found to block EPC mobilization increased by VEGF
(24). Endostatin was also shown to increase EPC apoptosis. Again,
in vivo effects of this agent on tumor vasculogenesis were not
addressed. Therefore, this study showed for the first time that
angiogenesis inhibitor inhibits tumor vasculogenesis by EPCs in vivo.
Because VEGF increases EPC mobilization from bone marrow
into circulation, decrement of VEGF expression can be a critical
control point (11, 36). In fact, when the effects of the VEGF-specific
antibody, Bevacizumab, on the number of circulating EPCs in six
patients with rectal adenocarcinoma were investigated, the amount
of CD133+ EPCs decreased in all patients, and all six patients
experienced tumor regression (36, 37). Interestingly, TK1-2 treatment decreased VEGF expression in tumor tissues with coimplanted EPCs. In the previous studies, we have shown the similar
pattern of VEGF suppression in tumor tissues upon TK1-2
treatment in several tumor models without EPC coimplantation.
Similar results were also shown in angiostatin fragment treatment
in a U87 glioma model (31). Endostatin and angiostatin have been
also reported to inhibit tumor growth by modulation of VEGF
expression in tumor cells in vitro and in vivo, with unknown
mechanisms (37). This notion was also supported by the previous
report that angiostatin down-regulates VEGF expression in the
retina in rats with oxygen-induced retinopathy or with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, but not in normal rats (38). In this
study, we showed that TK1-2 inhibits VEGF expression of EPCs
in vitro and in vivo. Because the labeled EPCs strongly react with
anti-VEGF antibody over the background level of VEGF expression
by A549 cells, EPCs are expected to be a major source of VEGF

Figure 6. TK1-2 inhibits secretion of VEGF from EPCs as well as conditioned medium–induced endothelial cell functions. A, the conditioned medium of EPCs
was measured for VEGF level by a VEGF ELISA kit. Upon TK1-2 treatment, VEGF secretion from EPCs in in vitro culture was reduced. B and C, the conditioned
medium potently stimulated endothelial cell proliferation (B) and migration (C ), which were inhibited by TK1-2– or VEGF-neutralizing antibody, but not by isotype IgG
control, suggesting that TK1-2 inhibits the endothelial functions induced by angiogenic factors including VEGF secreted from EPCs. *, P < 0.01, compared with no
treatment of TK1-2.

secretion in vivo. Thus, inhibition of VEGF expression of EPCs by
TK1-2 may provide a partial mechanism for the suppression of
tumor angiogenesis by TK1-2.
Through observation of the tumor tissue sections, we found that
the TK1-2–treated mice revealed lesser number of labeled
implanted EPCs than the nontreated mice, although the same
number of EPCs was implanted. At this point, we cannot answer
for those reasons. We can speculate some possibilities that TK1-2
may inhibit proliferation or induce apoptosis of the implanted
EPCs in vivo, or that TK1-2 may stimulate inflammatory cells to
phagocytose the EPCs.
It is interesting that TK1-2 inhibits the migratory activity of
ex vivo cultivated EPCs, although we observed TK1-2 did not inhibit
cancer cell migration.4 As shown in cultured embryonic stem cells
or isolated CD34+ cells, the multistep events including adhesion,
migration, chemoattraction, and differentiation to endothelial cells
are required in recruitment and incorporation of EPCs into
neovasculature (21, 22). Therefore, the inhibition of adhesion and
migration of expanded EPCs by TK1-2 enhances its usefulness in
antiangiogenic treatment. In vivo, TK1-2 also seemed to inhibit
EPC-EPC interaction because TK1-2 treatment showed more
separately locating implanted EPCs rather than aggregated form.
Moreover, TK1-2 also inhibited adhesion onto fibronectin matrix of
early undifferentiated EPC fraction from isolated MNCs in in vitro
culture conditions, thereby providing the strong possibility of the
inhibitory effect of TK1-2 on bone marrow–derived EPCs in vivo,
not alone ex vivo cultivated EPCs. Therefore, our studies provide
TK1-2 treatment as an efficient way of controlling EPC contribution
to tumor vessel formation and tumor growth.
Estimates of EPC contribution to the tumor endothelium range
from as much as 10% to 50% (8, 39), to 5% or less (40, 41). In

contrast to ischemic condition, the role of circulating EPCs is
controversial in tumor angiogenesis. However, the recent report
indicated that acute recruitment of circulating EPCs occurs after
vascular disrupting agents, such as combrestatin and OXi-4503
(42). These bone marrow–derived cells have been shown to home
to the viable tumor rim and incorporate into or around the tumor
vasculature, resulting in contribution to tumor regrowth. In
addition, disruption of this circulating EPC spike by antiangiogenic
drugs resulted in marked reductions in tumor rim size and blood
flow. The results obtained from our models using ex vivo cultivated
EPCs and TK1-2 also proved that antiangiogenic agents can
effectively inhibit EPC incorporation into tumor vasculature at
tumor periphery and EPC functions for tumor growth. Therefore,
targeting EPCs may be an effective strategy for inhibition of tumor
angiogenesis and growth, providing several possible ways, such as
inhibitions of mobilization, differentiation, incorporation into
endothelium, and other functions such as VEGF secretion.
At present, a homogenous population of EPCs is not available,
and the characteristics of these cells are not clearly defined.
Circulating EPCs and in vitro cultivated EPCs are both heterogeneous. In both cell types, some cells incorporate into vasculature
and others exist around vasculature in vivo, thereby contributing to
vessel formation and enhancing angiogenesis. In the future, if EPCs
are more clearly understood, we can approach the role of EPCs in
tumor angiogenesis and the effects of antiangiogenic agents in a
more precise manner.
