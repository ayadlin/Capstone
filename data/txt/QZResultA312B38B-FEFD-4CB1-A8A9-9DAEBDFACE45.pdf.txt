ABSTRACT
We recently discovered mutation signatures reminiscent of BRCA deficiency in the
vast majority of a set of primary osteosarcomas (OS). In the current study, we therefore
investigated the sensitivity of a panel of OS cell lines to the poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase
(PARP) inhibitor talazoparib alone and in combination with several chemotherapeutic
drugs (i.e. temozolomide (TMZ), SN-38, doxorubicin, cisplatin, methotrexate (MTX),
etoposide/carboplatin). Here, we identified an association between homologous
recombination (HR) repair deficiency and the response of OS cell lines to talazoparib. All
OS cell lines with molecular features characteristic of BRCA1/2 mutant tumors (so-called
“BRCAness”), such as disruptive gains in PTEN or FANCD2 and/or losses of ATM, BAP1,
BARD1 or CHEK2, were susceptible to talazoparib-induced reduction of cell viability
(i.e. MG63, ZK-58,, SaOS-2 and MNNG-HOS). Consistent with their high sensitivity to
talazoparib, MG63 and ZK-58 cells scored positive in a DNA-based measure of genomic
instability (i.e. homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)-loss of heterozygosity
(LOH) score). In contrast, U2OS cells that carry a heterozygous BRCA2 mutation
and therefore most likely have one intact BRCA2 allele left proved to be resistant to
talazoparib. Furthermore, we identified TMZ as the most potent chemotherapeutic
drug together with talazoparib to synergistically reduce cell viability, as confirmed by
calculation of combination index (CI) values, and to suppress long-term clonogenic
survival. Mechanistically, talazoparib and TMZ cooperated to induce apoptotic cell
death, as demonstrated by activation of BAX and BAK, loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential (MMP), caspase activation, DNA fragmentation and caspase-dependent cell
death. Genetic silencing of BAX and BAK or pharmacological inhibition of caspases by
zVAD.fmk significantly rescued OS cells from talazoparib/TMZ-induced apoptosis. These
findings have important implications for the development of novel treatment strategies

features of BRCAness.

In the current study, we aimed i) to investigate
the vulnerability of a panel of OS cell lines to the PARP
inhibitor talazoparib, ii) to explore the antitumor activity
of talazoparib in combination with chemotherapeutics and
to identify the most potent synergistic drug combinations
and ii) to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of synergy
with a specific focus on cell death pathways.

INTRODUCTION
OS is the most common primary bone cancer in
children and young adults [1]. There is a high demand
for more effective treatment options for OS patients, as
the outcome of patients with refractory and/or metastatic
disease remains poor with five-year survival rates below
30% [2]. Recently, we showed that the majority of
OS harbor defects in HR repair either due to BRCA1/2
mutations or to mutations in HR pathway genes, such
as FANCD2 [3]. Loss-of-function mutations in BRCA1
or BRCA2 as well as BRCAness have previously been
reported to confer sensitivity towards PARP inhibitors,
since ineffective HR repair induces a dependency on
base excision repair to cope with DNA damage [4]. Thus,
blockage of base excision repair using PARP inhibitors
causes synthetic lethality in cancers with defects in
HR repair, as cells are no longer capable to repair the
cumulating DNA damage and undergo cell death [5, 6].
Currently, several PARP inhibitors (for example
olaparib, talazoparib, veliparib, niraparib and rucaparib)
are being investigated in clinical trials [7]. In 2014 the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first PARP
inhibitor, olaparib, for the treatment of BRCA-mutated
ovarian cancer and recently designated a breakthrough
therapy status for olaparib in BRCA- or ATM-mutated
castration-resistant prostate cancer [8, 9]. All PARP
inhibitors inhibit the catalytic function of PARP1, required
for PARylation of damaged DNA, while they differ in their
ability to trap PARP1 to DNA, leading to replication fork
stalling and cell death [10]. Talazoparib has been reported
to harbor the highest PARP1 trapping activity, while its
ability to inhibit catalytic PARP1 function is comparable to
other inhibitors [10, 11]. Therefore, we focused our study
on the PARP inhibitor talazoparib.
Programmed cell death such as apoptosis plays
an important role in the response of tumors to cytotoxic
therapies, as most cytotoxic therapies exert their antitumor
activity by engaging programmed cell death [12]. Apoptosis
can be activated by two well-defined pathways, i.e. the
extrinsic (death receptor) and the intrinsic (mitochondrial)
pathway, which both finally culminate in the activation
of caspases as effectors of cell death [13]. Activation of
the mitochondrial pathway leads to mitochondrial outer
membrane permeabilization (MOMP) together with release
of mitochondrial intermembrane space proteins into the
cytosol triggering caspase activation and apoptosis [14].
MOMP is a process tightly regulated by various proteins,
including the BCL-2 family of proteins, which can be
divided into three different groups, the antiapoptotic BCL-2
proteins (e.g. BCL-2, BCL-XL and MCL-1), the proapoptotic
multidomain BCL-2 proteins BAK and BAX and the
proapoptotic BH3-only domain proteins [15].

RESULTS
Response of OS cell lines to the PARP inhibitor
talazoparib is associated with their genetic
signatures of BRCAness
To investigate whether OS cells are susceptible to
PARP1 inhibition, we tested the sensitivity of a panel of
OS cell lines (i.e. MG63, ZK-58, SaOS-2, MNNG-HOS
and U2OS) towards treatment with the PARP inhibitor
talazoparib. According to the observed response pattern
among the OS cell lines, we defined three subgroups.
MG63 and ZK-58 cells displayed the highest sensitivity
towards talazoparib with IC50 values in the nanomolar
range (IC50: MG63 = 0.448 μM, ZK-58 = 0.115 μM)
(Figure 1A). SaOS-2, MNNG-HOS cells showed
intermediate sensitivity to talazoparib with micromolar
IC50 values (IC50: SaOS-2 = 33.57 μM, MNNG-HOS =
87.56 μM), whereas U2OS cells remained largely resistant
(≈70% viability at 100 μM talazoparib) (Figure 1A).
Generally, this response of the OS cell lines to
monotherapy with talazoparib correlated with their
genetic background, as OS cell lines that were susceptible
to talazoparib-mediated reduction of cell viability harbor
defects in HR pathway genes. MG63 cells exhibit losses
in BAP1, FANCA and FANCD2 (Figure 1B). ZK-58 cells
carry a disruptive gain in FANCD2 and loss of BARD1,
SaOS-2 cells harbor losses in CHEK2 and TP53, and
MNNG-HOS cells are characterized by a loss of ATM as
well as by disruptive gains of PTEN and FANCD2 (Figure
1B). In contrast, the talazoparib-resistant cell line U2OS
carries a heterozygous BRCA2 mutation (Figure 1B), most
likely with one intact BRCA2 allele left.
To explore whether the observed response of OS
cell lines to talazoparib is associated with their degree
of genomic instability as a consequence of HR repair
deficiency, we determined HRD-LOH score, a DNA-based
measure of genomic instability [16]. Interestingly, MG63
and ZK-58 scored positive for HRD-LOH, consistent
with their high sensitivity to talazoparib, whereas U2OS
cells that were resistant to talazoparib scored negative for
HRD-LOH (Figure 1B). SaOS-2 and MNNG-HOS cells
that exhibited intermediate vulnerability to talazoparib
were borderline, respectively positive by HRD-LOH
score (Figure 1B). Taken together, this set of experiments

inhibitor talazoparib is associated with their mutation
signatures and the resulting degree of BRCAness.

when used as monotherapy compared to solvent-treated
controls. To identify synergistic drug interactions we
calculated CI values and fraction affected (Fa) values
[17], which are shown as CI over Fa plots for each drug
(Figure 3, Supplementary Table 1). For comparison,
we selected drug combinations that lead to the most
pronounced synergy (lowest CI values and highest Fa
values), full information on CI and Fa values are shown in
Supplementary Table 1.
This analysis revealed three different classes of
synergy of chemotherapeutics with talazoparib (10 nM) in
four of the tested OS cell lines (i.e. MG63, ZK-58, SaOS-2
and MNNG-HOS) that we defined as highly synergistic (CI
<0.2, Fa >0.5), intermediately synergistic (CI >0.2<0.9, Fa
>0.5) and weakly synergistic (CI >0.2<0.9, Fa >0.3<0.5).

Screening for synergistic drug interactions of
talazoparib and chemotherapeutic drugs
To address the question as to whether or not PARP
inhibitors modulate chemosensitivity of OS cells, we
tested the effect of talazoparib in combination with several
established anticancer drugs, such as TMZ, cisplatin,
doxorubicin, SN-38, MTX and etoposide/carboplatin
(Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 1). We used
suboptimal concentrations of talazoparib and anticancer
drugs that caused up to 20-40% reduction of cell viability

Figure 1: Talazoparib reduces cell viability of OS cells with genetic signatures of BRCAness. A. OS cells were treated for

72 hours with indicated concentrations of talazoparib. Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay and is shown as percentage of untreated
control. IC50 values were calculated using SigmaPlot™. B. HRD-LOH score, ploidy, mutational profile and IC50 values for talazoparib are

In contrast, we found no consistent synergistic interaction
of talazoparib with the tested anticancer drugs in U2OS
cells, as CI values showed no synergism (CI >0.9) and/or
Fa values were below 0.3 with the exception of a few drug
combinations (Figure 3, Supplementary Table 1).
For TMZ in combination with talazoparib we
detected a highly synergistic drug interaction in all four
responding OS cell lines (i.e. MG63, ZK-58, SaOS-2
and MNNG-HOS), as indicated by CI values < 0.2 and
Fa values > 0.7 (Figure 3A, Supplementary Table 1). For
SN-38 together with talazoparib we observed intermediate
synergy with some variations between the responding four

OS cell lines. SaOS-2 and MNNG-HOS cells proved to be
more responsive to cotreatment with talazoparib and SN38 (CI < 0.4 and Fa > 0.5) compared to MG63 and ZK-58
cells (CI ≈ 0.8 and Fa > 0.5) (Figure 3B, Supplementary
Table 1). Intermediate synergy was also found for the
combination of talazoparib and cisplatin or doxorubicin
(Figure 3C, 3D, Supplementary Table 1). However, the
response pattern to the cotreatment with doxorubicin
and talazoparib was more heterogeneous, as SaOS-2 and
MNNG-HOS cells displayed intermediate synergism, ZK58 cells high synergism and MG63 cells weak synergism
(Figure 3D). Weak synergy was predominately found for

concentrations of TMZ, cisplatin and doxorubicin. Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay and is expressed as percentage of untreated

Fa plots were created according to the Materials and Methods section based on data shown in Figure 2 for combinations of talazoparib
and chemotherapeutic drugs. CI/Fa values are shown for talazoparib concentrations ranging from 10 nM to 5 μM depending on the cell
line (MG63, ZK-58: 10, 50, 100 nM; SaOS-2, MNNG-HOS, U2OS: 0.5, 1, 5 μM) in combination with the following concentrations of
chemotherapeutics: 100 μM TMZ (A), 2 nM SN-38 (B), 0.5 μM cisplatin for MG63, ZK-58, SaOS-2 and MNNG-HOS and 0.1 μM cisplatin

the combination of MTX with talazoparib, as only selected
drug combinations yielded synergistic CI values in more
than 50% of the cell population in ZK-58 and MNNGHOS cells (Figure 3E, Supplementary Table 1). A weak
to intermediate synergism depending on the cell line was
detected for the combination of etoposide/carboplatin and
talazoparib (Figure 3F, Supplementary Table 1). Thus,
TMZ turned out to be the most potent and promising
anticancer drug that consistently acted in concert with
talazoparib to reduce cell viability in a highly synergistic
manner in four OS cells.

talazoparib/TMZ combination treatment, we monitored
the kinetics of cell death. Talazoparib acted in concert with
TMZ to increase DNA fragmentation in a time-dependent
manner in both cell lines with a significant increase in cell
death upon talazoparib/TMZ cotreatment at 24 hours in
ZK-58 cells and at 48 hours in MG63 cells (Figure 5A).
To monitor activation of caspases as typical effector
molecules of apoptosis we performed a caspase-3/7
activity assay. Talazoparib cooperated with TMZ to
significantly increase caspase-3/7 activity in both cell lines
(Figure 5B). To investigate whether caspase activity is
required for the induction of apoptosis, we used the broadrange caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk, which significantly
decreased talazoparib/TMZ-induced apoptosis in both cell
lines (Figure 5C). However, the protection by zVAD.fmk
was only partial in MG63 cells (Figure 5C), suggesting
that caspase-independent mechanisms might also be
involved. This set of experiments demonstrates that
talazoparib/TMZ-induced cell death is time-dependent
with slower kinetics in MG63 than ZK-58 cells and occurs
in a caspase-dependent manner.
To explore whether the addition of talazoparib
would potentiate the cytotoxicity of TMZ also in nonmalignant cells, we tested the effect of TMZ in the
presence and absence of talazoparib on human peripheral
blood lymphocytes (PBLs) that were freshly isolated from
two different donors. We used PBLs, as hematological
toxicity has been described for talazoparib [18].
Neither single treatment of talazoparib or TMZ nor the
combination of talazoparib/TMZ caused any detectable
cytotoxicity in PBLs compared to untreated controls
(Supplementary Figure 2) at the same time point and at
similar concentrations that cooperated to trigger cell death
in OS cells (Figure 4A). These results point to some tumor
selectivity of the talazoparib/TMZ combination treatment.

Talazoparib/TMZ cotreatment is superior to
cisplatin or doxorubicin to trigger cell death and
to suppress clonogenic growth
Since we identified MG63 and ZK-58 cells to be
most sensitive to treatment with talazoparib alone (Figure
1A) and in combination with TMZ (Figures 2, 3A), we
selected those cell lines for our subsequent studies. To
further assess the antitumor activity of selected drug
combinations we performed additional assays and
determined DNA fragmentation as a marker of apoptotic
cell death and colony formation as a parameter of longterm clonogenic survival. For these talazoparib-based
combinations, we focused on TMZ, since it showed the
most pronounced synergy together with talazoparib, and
on cisplatin and doxorubicin, as they are generally used
in the standard treatment of OS [2]. Notably, talazoparib
cooperated with TMZ to significantly increase DNA
fragmentation and to suppress colony formation in both
OS cell lines (Figure 4A, 4D). While talazoparib acted
in concert with cisplatin or doxorubicin to significantly
enhance DNA fragmentation in ZK-58 cells, these
combinations were not more effective than single agents
alone to cause DNA fragmentation in MG63 cells (Figure
4B, 4C). In addition, cotreatment with talazoparib and
cisplatin or doxorubicin failed in both OS cell lines to
inhibit colony formation significantly better than treatment
with these drugs alone (Figure 4E, 4F). Together, these
findings suggest that the combination of talazoparib
with TMZ is superior to the combination of talazoparib
with cisplatin or doxorubicin to trigger cell death and
to suppress long-term clonogenic survival in the two
investigated OS cell lines. However, further investigation
in additional OS cell lines is required to address the
question as to whether or not talazoparib is suitable to
increase chemosensitivity of OS cells to cisplatin or
doxorubicin. In the following, we focused our mechanistic
studies on the combination of talazoparib and TMZ.

Talazoparib/TMZ cotreatment triggers BAX/
BAK activation and MOMP
Next, we asked whether talazoparib and TMZ
cooperate to activate BAK and BAX, two multidomain
proapoptotic BCL-2 proteins that control MOMP [15].
To address this question, we immunoprecipitated BAK
and BAX using conformation-specific antibodies,
since activation of BAK and BAX is accompanied by a
conformational change. Strikingly, talazoparib and TMZ
acted in concert to activate BAK and BAX in both OS
cell lines compared to treatment with either agent alone
(Figure 6A). We detected BAK and BAX activation upon
talazoparib/TMZ treatment at a later time point (i.e. 36
hours) in MG63 cells compared to ZK-58 cells (i.e. 24
hours) (Figure 6A), consistent with the slower kinetics
of cell death in MG63 compared to ZK-58 cells (Figure
5A). To explore whether BAK and BAX activation is
required for talazoparib/TMZ-induced apoptosis, we
concomitantly silenced BAK and BAX by siRNAs

PTEN-deficient cells were found to be sensitive to the
PARP inhibitor olaparib [22]. Also, ATM-deficient
lymphoid tumor cells have shown vulnerability to olaparib
in vitro and in vivo [23]. Furthermore, BARD1 has been
reported to be one of the main binding partners of BRCA1
and BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer binds to DNA damage
sites [24]. CHEK2-mediated phosphorylation of BRCA1
at serine 988 has been shown to regulate DNA damage
response [25]. Ubiquitination of FANCD2 plays an
important role in the disposal of DNA interstrand crosslinks [26] and the deficiency of FANCD2, ATM or CHK2
was described to lead to non-functional HR and sensitivity
to PARP inhibition [27]. Thus, loss of function in genes
involved in HR repair can cause BRCAness, resulting in
increased vulnerability to PARP1 inhibition.
Furthermore, among the tested chemotherapeutic
drugs we identified TMZ to be most potent for combination
treatment with talazoparib in OS, which was confirmed by
highly synergistic CI values and by a large fraction of cells
affected. In addition, talazoparib and TMZ acted together
not only to reduce cell viability, but also to trigger cell
death and to suppress long-term clonogenic survival. We
and other groups previously demonstrated that the DNAdamaging agent TMZ is particularly suitable for PARP
inhibitor-based combination treatment, yielding highly
synergistic drug interaction in Ewing sarcoma cells [2830]. Depending on the type of DNA lesions generated by
genotoxic drugs, PARP1 is bound to DNA and/or required
for DNA repair [28]. Methylated bases formed as a result
of treatment with TMZ are repaired by base excision
repair, thereby producing a repair intermediate to which
PARP1 is recruited [7, 29]. Synergistic interaction of the
PARP inhibitor olaparib with topoisomerase I inhibitors,
doxorubicin or platinum drugs has been reported in a panel
of pediatric solid tumor cell lines including two OS cell
lines, while TMZ was not included in that study [31].
Our molecular studies revealed that the synergistic
cytotoxicity of talazoparib and TMZ in OS cells involves
the induction of apoptotic cell death. First, we showed
that talazoparib/TMZ cotreatment triggered DNA
fragmentation and loss of MMP as characteristic markers
of apoptotic cell death. Second, talazoparib/TMZstimulated activation of BAK and BAX contributed to the
induction of apoptosis, since genetic silencing of BAK
and BAX significantly reduced talazoparib/TMZ-induced
cell death. Third, talazoparib and TMZ acted together
to activate caspases, which were required for apoptosis,
as the caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk significantly rescued
talazoparib/TMZ-mediated cell death. While our data
showing that zVAD.fmk as well as BAK/BAX silencing
significantly reduced talazoparib/TMZ-induced cell death
demonstrated that caspases and BAK/BAX activation
contributed to talazoparib/TMZ-induced apoptosis,
additional mechanisms are also likely to be involved, since
the protection by zVAD.fmk or BAK/BAX knockdown
was only partial.

(Figure 6B). Notably, knockdown of BAK and BAX
significantly rescued talazoparib/TMZ-mediated apoptosis
in all different combinations of siRNA constructs used to
silence BAK and BAX (Figure 6C). However, BAK/BAX
silencing only partly, yet significantly reduced talazoparib/
TMZ-induced apoptosis (Figure 6C), pointing also to
BAK/BAX-independent mechanisms. Since activation
of BAK and BAX leads to pore formation in the outer
mitochondrial membrane accompanied by loss of MMP,
we then assessed the MMP by JC-1 staining, a dye that
accumulates in polarized mitochondria. Talazoparib and
TMZ cooperated to trigger a significant loss of MMP in
both cell lines (Figure 6D). These findings demonstrate
that talazoparib/TMZ cotreatment promotes BAX/BAK
activation and loss of MMP in OS cells.

DISCUSSION
Using exome sequencing, we recently identified
mutation signatures characteristic of BRCA deficiency
in OS [3], indicating that OS might be susceptible to
PARP inhibitors. Therefore, the current study aimed to
investigate the sensitivity of a panel of OS cell lines to
the PARP inhibitor talazoparib alone or in combination
with various chemotherapeutics, most of them commonly
used in the treatment of OS. Here, we discovered that the
response of OS cell lines to monotherapy with talazoparib
correlated with their mutation signatures and the resulting
degree of BRCAness. All four OS cell lines that were
susceptible to talazoparib-mediated inhibition of cell
viability harbored genetic alterations in genes that are
functionally analogous to BRCA1/2 mutations, including
disruptive gains in PTEN and FANCD2 and/or losses of
ATM, BAP1, BARD1, FANCA or CHEK2, although none
of the tested OS cell lines showed a bi-allelic BRCA1/2
mutation [3]. In contrast, talazoparib-resistant U2OS cells
carry a heterozygous BRCA2 mutation [3] and most likely
have one intact BRCA2 allele left.
Importantly, the susceptibility of OS cell lines
to talazoparib broadly correlated with their degree of
genomic instability, as MG63 and ZK-58 cells that
exhibited high sensitivity to talazoparib with nanomolar
IC50 values scored positive in HRD-LOH score, a DNAbased measure of genomic instability [16]. In contrast,
U2OS cells that were resistant to talazoparib were HRDLOH score-negative. Cell lines exhibiting micromolar
IC50 values for talazoparib (i.e. SaOS-2 and MNNG-HOS
cells) were borderline, respectively positive by HRD-LOH
score. Testing of talazoparib monotherapy in the pediatric
preclinical testing program has previously shown minimal
in vivo activity against OS; however, the BRCAness status
of OS was not reported in that study [19].
PTEN, ATM, BAP1, BARD1, CHEK2, FANCA and
FANCD2 have been shown to exert pivotal functions in
HR repair [20]. Loss of PTEN function has previously
been described to cause genomic instability [21], and

Determination of apoptosis, cell viability and
colony formation

PARP inhibitors are widely used in clinical trials
for several cancers carrying BRCA1/2 mutations or the
signature of BRCAness such as ovarian cancer, prostate
cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, and soft-tissue
sarcomas [32], and olaparib gained FDA approval for
BRCA1/2-mutated ovarian cancer and castration-resistant
prostate cancer [8, 9]. Together with our recent report
showing that the vast majority of a set of primary OS
specimens exhibit genetic traits of BRCA deficiency [3],
our present study indicates that PARP inhibitor-based
therapies may also present a novel targeted treatment
option for a defined subgroup of OS patients that harbor
features of BRCAness. Further studies are therefore
warranted in future to extend our investigation of
talazoparib/TMZ combination therapy to a larger panel
of OS cell lines including primary human OS cultures
and to an in vivo model of OS. Since the addition of
talazoparib did not increase the cytotoxicity of TMZ
on non-malignant PBLs, there might be a therapeutic
window for the incorporation of talazoparib into treatment
protocols for OS. Selective synthetic lethality of the
talazoparib/TMZ combination treatment in OS cells might
be explained by the fact that cancer cells but not normal
cells harbor HR repair deficiency. The doses of talazoparib
and TMZ that caused synergistic induction of cell death
in our study correspond to clinically achievable plasma
concentrations of those drugs (up to 67 nM for talazoparib
[18] and up to 100 μM for TMZ [33]), underlining the
potential clinical relevance of our study. Taken together,
our study has important implications for the development
of novel treatment strategies using PARP inhibitors alone
or together with chemotherapy in a subset of OS with
features of BRCAness.

Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometric
analysis (FACSCanto II, BD Biosciences, Heidelberg,
Germany) of DNA fragmentation of propidium iodide
(PI)-stained nuclei as described previously [34]. Cell
viability was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche Diagnostics,
Mannheim, Germany). Results are expressed as
percentage of cell viability relative to untreated controls.
For colony formation assay cells were treated as indicated
for 24 hours. Subsequently, living cells were counted, 100
cells were reseeded and cultured in drug-free medium for
additional 10, respectively 12 days before fixation and
staining with 0.5% crystal violet, 30% ethanol and 3%
formaldehyde. Colonies were counted macroscopically.

Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed as described
previously [34] using the following antibodies: BAK
(BD, New Jersey, USA), BAX NT (Millipore, Darmstadt,
Germany), GAPDH (HyTest, Turku, Finland). Goat
anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated
to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Heidelberg, Germany) were used as secondary antibodies
and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Bioscience,
Freiburg, Germany) or infrared dye-labeled secondary
antibodies and infrared imaging were used for detection
(Odyssey Imaging System, LI-COR Bioscience, Bad
Homburg, Germany). Representative blots of at least two
independent experiments are shown.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Caspase activity assay

Cell culture and chemicals

For determining caspase activity cells were
treated as indicated and caspase activity was assessed
by caspase-3/7 staining according to the manufacturer’s
instructions for CellEvent Caspase-3/7 Green Detection
Reagent (ThermoFisher scientific, Schwerte, Germany)
using ImageXpress Micro XLS system (Molecular
Devices, Biberach an der Riss, Germany).

OS cell lines (MG63, ZK-58, SaOS-2, MNNGHOS and U2OS) were kindly provided by M. Nathrath
(München, Germany) and authenticated by STR profiles.
Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life
Technologies, Inc., Darmstadt, Germany), supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% penicillin/
streptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (all from Life
Technologies, Inc.). Cell lines were regularly tested for
mycoplasma contamination to ensure that experiments
were performed only with mycoplasma-free cell lines.
Talazoparib was obtained from Selleckchem (Munich,
Germany). TMZ, SN-38, cisplatin, doxorubicin
and etoposide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(Taufkirchen, Germany), MTX and carboplatin were
purchased from Medac (Hamburg, Germany), zVAD.fmk
from Bachem (Heidelberg, Germany). Chemicals were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Carl Roth (Karlsruhe,
Germany) unless otherwise indicated.

RNA interference
Cells were reversely transfected with a combination
of targeting siRNAs (10nM for control siRNA, 4390844,
5 nM for BAK, s1880 and s1881; 5 nM for BAX, s1889
and s1890) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent
(Life Technologies, Inc., Darmstadt, Germany) and OptiMEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). After six hours
of incubation with transfection solution, the medium was
changed and cells recovered for 48 hours before drug
treatment.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Determination of BAK and BAX activation or
MMP

The authors disclose no potential conflicts of
interest.

BAK and BAX activation was determined by
immunoprecipitation of active conformation by specific
antibodies. Briefly, cells were lysed in CHAPS lysis
buffer (10 mmol/l HEPES, pH 7.4; 150 mmol/l NaCl;
1% CHAPS). 500 μg protein was incubated overnight
at 4°C with 8 μg mouse anti-BAX antibody (clone 6A7;
Sigma) or 0.5 μg mouse anti-BAK antibody (AB-1;
Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) and 10 μl pan mouse
IgG Dynabeads (Dako, Hamburg, Germany), washed with
CHAPS lysis buffer and analyzed by Western blotting
using rabbit anti-BAX NT antibody (Millipore, Darmstadt,
Germany) or rabbit anti-BAK antibody (BD Biosciences).
Loss of MMP was assessed by JC-1 staining according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher
scientific).
