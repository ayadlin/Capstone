Abstract

Author Manuscript

Pathogenic mycobacteria induce the formation of complex cellular aggregates called granulomas
that are the hallmark of tuberculosis1,2. Here we examine the development and consequences of
vascularisation of the tuberculous granuloma in the zebrafish-Mycobacterium marinum infection
model characterised by organised granulomas with necrotic cores that bear striking resemblance to
those of human tuberculosis2. Using intravital microscopy in the transparent larval zebrafish, we
show that granuloma formation is intimately associated with angiogenesis. The initiation of
angiogenesis in turn coincides with the generation of local hypoxia and transcriptional induction
of the canonical pro-angiogenic molecule VEGFA. Pharmacological inhibition of the VEGF
pathway suppresses granuloma-associated angiogenesis, reduces infection burden and limits
dissemination. Moreover, anti-angiogenic therapies synergise with the first-line anti-tubercular
antibiotic rifampicin as well as with the antibiotic metronidazole, which targets hypoxic bacterial
populations3. Our data suggest that mycobacteria induce granuloma-associated angiogenesis,
which promotes mycobacterial growth and increases spread of infection to new tissue sites. We
propose the use of anti-angiogenic agents, now being used in cancer regimens, as a host-targeting
TB therapy, particularly in extensively drug-resistant disease where current antibiotic regimens are
largely ineffective.

The human tuberculous granuloma, a tightly cohesive cellular structure that houses infecting
mycobacteria, develops hypoxic areas around its necrotic core4. In tumours, the
development of hypoxia is tightly linked to angiogenesis and subsequent metastasis5. In
tuberculosis, attention has focused on the possible consequences of granuloma hypoxia to
bacterial physiology,4 but relatively little attention has been paid to the functional
significance of findings that tuberculous granulomas are extensively vascularised6–8.

In its natural ectothermic hosts, Mycobacterium marinum, the closest relative of the M.
tuberculosis complex, causes a disease called fish tuberculosis, a systemic wasting disease
with organised epithelioid granulomas with necrotic cores. In zebrafish larvae,
mycobacterium-infected macrophages form early granulomas, undergo a hallmark
epithelioid transformation, and activate granuloma-specific gene expression programs2,9.

To monitor host vasculature in zebrafish, we used the Tg(kdrl:egfp)s843 line (referred to
hereafter as Tg(flk1:EGFP)), in which vascular endothelial cells are fluorescently labelled10.
Injection of mycobacteria into the most commonly used caudal vein (CV) site results in
granulomas in the immediate vicinity of the richly-vascularised area of the caudal
haematopoietic tissue (CHT) (Figure 1A). To determine if a different injection site with
sparser and smaller blood vessels was more suitable to detect angiogenesis, assessed primary
granulomas that typically formed dorsally after injection into the trunk (Figure 1B and 1C).
As with CV injection, trunk injection resulted in most bacteria becoming macrophageresident in granulomas (Extended Data 1A). Trunk granulomas progressed similarly to CV
granulomas, with dissemination into richly-vascularised areas11 (Supplementary Video 1).
Using Tg(mpeg1:tomato-caaxxt3) larvae, where macrophages are labelled by membranebound Tomato, revealed similar macrophage dynamics11, including the interstitial egress of
infected macrophages, the transfer of M. marinum between granulomas, and coalescence of
distal bacteria into existing granulomas (Supplementary Videos 2–4). Some infected
macrophages invaded vasculature around the primary granuloma (Extended Data 1B and
Supplementary Video 5).

Author Manuscript

Imaging of trunk-infected larvae revealed angiogenesis, with growth of vasculature around
sites of infection. We observed sprouting from the existing intersegmental vessels (ISVs)
starting at 4 dpi, just after the formation of granulomas (Figure 1C). We assessed the
features of vessel sprouting through long-term live imaging of infected larvae
(Supplementary Videos 6–9). Vessel growth occurred in spurts with extended periods of
quiescence or even reversed directionality (Extended Data 1C).
To examine the mode of vascular elongation, we used blue-fluorescent M. marinum to infect
the transgenic zebrafish line Tg(fli1a:nlsEGFPy7; flk1:mCherryis5), in which endothelial
nuclei are marked by EGFP expression. At 4 dpi, nuclei left the highly-organised ISVs,
always towards sites of infection, and subsequently divided within the somites (Extended
Data 1D and Supplementary Video 10). Vessels sprouted from both arterial and venous
ISVs (Extended Data 1E).

Author Manuscript

We determined whether new blood vessels generated around the granuloma were functional.
Using DsRed-labelled erythrocytes in the transgenic line Tg(flk1:EGFP; gata1:DsRedsd2)
we found substantial blood flow through both ectopic vessels that spanned existing vessels
completely and into newer blind-ending vessels (Extended Data 1F).
Angiogenesis required persistent M. marinum infection; it did not develop following
injection of PBS, heat-killed M. marinum or non-pathogenic Escherichia coli (Extended
Data 2A). Tumour-associated macrophages are important drivers of tumour angiogenesis
upon tumour hypoxia12. Since macrophages serve as a principal repository of virulent

mycobacteria, we assessed if there were differences in vascular recruitment between
macrophage-resident and extracellular mycobacteria. Infection of double transgenic
Tg(flk1:EGFP, mpeg1:tomato-caaxxt3) embryos infected with M. marinum-cerulean allowed
us to discriminate between intracellular and extracellular bacteria (Figure 2A). Enumeration
of vascular branching revealed an elevated vascularisation rate for intracellular compared
with extracellular foci (OR [95% ci], 4 dpi 6.63 [2.57–17.11], 5 dpi 6.93 [1.51–31.75], 6 dpi
27.84 [10.18–76.18]) (Extended Data 2B).

Author Manuscript

To demonstrate a functional requirement for macrophages in recruiting vasculature we
performed morpholino knockdown of the transcription factor Pu.1/Spi1, which fully ablates
all macrophages through 5 dpf13 (Extended Data 2C). As previously reported14, infection
burden was markedly increased in the Spi1 knockdown animals (Extended Data 2D).
Despite increased burden, the total length of abnormal vasculature was decreased in
morpholino-injected animals compared with controls, suggesting that macrophages
specifically mediate new vessel growth in the context of inflammation (Figure 2B).
Vascularisation coincided with the formation of granulomas at around 4 dpi. We disrupted
mycobacterium-driven granuloma formation, using an ESX1-deficient M. marinum strain
(ΔESX1) deficient for granuloma formation15. We infected with 7.5-fold excess ΔESX1
over wildtype, to generate equivalent bacterial burdens at 4 dpi (Extended Data 2E). As
expected, both strains were predominantly macrophage-resident, but ΔESX1 infection
resulted in fewer granulomas and a marked reduction in angiogenesis (Figure 2C). Thus,
macrophage residence per se is not sufficient to induce angiogenesis. Rather, macrophages
that have undergone further differentiation to form granulomas appear to be required.

Author Manuscript

When we analysed the relationship between the size of individual infection foci and the
length of recruited vasculature we found a strong correlation (Extended Data 3A). This
relationship is reminiscent of the angiogenic switch, in which tumour size is directly related
to the requirement for vascularisation due to the development of local hypoxia5.

Author Manuscript

We therefore asked whether hypoxia develops within granulomas. Activation of HIF-1α
increases transcription of prolyl hydroxylase 3 (phd3), which serves as a reporter for
hypoxic conditions in zebrafish larvae16,17. We detected robust expression of phd3 within
trunk granulomas, but not CHT granulomas, which are already proximate to vasculature
(Extended Data 3B) consistent with a lack of hypoxia in the CHT18. Conversely, to assess
whether mycobacteria within granulomas were experiencing hypoxia, we investigated the
effect of metronidazole treatment19. Metronidazole specifically kills anaerobically-growing
bacteria including anaerobically-growing M. tuberculosis, but is ineffective during aerobic
growth3,19,20. We utilised a nitroreductase-expressing transgenic line Tg(lyzC:ntr-p2AlanYFPxt14) to titrate a biologically active dose of metronidazole (Extended Data 3C).
Consistent with the phd3 staining, metronidazole treatment reduced bacterial burden in
trunk-infected animals but not CV-infected larvae (Figure 2D).
In tumours, hypoxia is known to induce VEGF expression, which in turn stimulates
angiogenesis21. VEGF has been associated with TB pathogenesis: it is induced in active
pulmonary TB22, and, in a rat corneal model, mediates neovascularisation in granulomas

triggered by mycobacterial trehalose-6,6′-dimycolate23. VEGF plays a conserved role in
homeostatic blood vessel recruitment in zebrafish24. We observed strong vegfaa expression
around sites of mycobacterial granulomas in the trunk (Figure 2E). Similar expression levels
were also observed around CHT granulomas indicating that initiation of pro-angiogenic
signalling is not dependent on prior development of hypoxia during infection (Extended
Data 4A). Analysis of stained sections revealed cells around the edge of mycobacterial
granulomas expressing vegfaa, an observation consistent with a primarily macrophagedriven expression pattern that could be reduced by macrophage depletion (Extended Data
4B). In addition to its role in angiogenesis, VEGFA plays an important role in driving
vascular permeability25. We performed microangiography on infected animals and found
increased vascular leakage, suggesting a local effect of vegfaa expression around infection
foci (Extended Data 4C).

Angiogenesis and, specifically, VEGFR signalling have been targeted in cancer therapies.
Our findings suggested that these therapies might also be useful for mycobacterial
infections. We chose the well-characterised small molecule SU5416, a prototypical tyrosine
kinase receptor, and pazopanib, a clinically relevant VEGFR inhibitor26,27. Treatment of
infected animals with SU5416 or pazopanib prevented ectopic angiogenesis around the
forming granulomas in Tg(flk1:EGFP) animals and reduced net bacterial burdens (Figure
3A and Extended Data 5A). Neither compound affected in vitro growth of M. marinum,
suggesting that the effect on bacterial burden was through targeting host pathways
(Extended Data 5B). We confirmed that the treatments were specifically targeting
angiogenesis since bacterial burdens were lowered only in trunk-infected and not in CVinfected animals (Extended Data 5C). Additionally, in trunk-infected animals, growth
restriction did not occur until after the initiation of angiogenesis at 4 dpi (Extended Data
5D). To determine if VEGFR inhibition affected macrophage recruitment, we compared the
association of bacterial foci with macrophages between control and pazopanib-treated
larvae. We did not observe any differences in the proportion of macrophage-associated foci
at timepoints between 4 and 6 dpi (Extended Data 5E). Together, these data suggest that
VEGFR inhibition reduces bacterial burden specifically through restriction of
vascularisation.
To determine if VEGFR inhibition also reduced infection-induced vascular permeability, we
measured permeability in treated and untreated animals matched for infection burden. We
found a reduction in vascular leakiness in animals treated with VEGFR inhibitor (Extended
Data 5F).

Angiogenesis is thought to play an important role in tumour metastasis5. Analogously, in
long-term monitoring experiments, we observed a decreased rate of M. marinum
dissemination to distal sites in animals treated with VEGFR antagonist compared with
untreated animals (OR 0.27, 95% ci 0.12 to 0.63) (Figure 3B and Extended Data 5G). To
investigate if decreased dissemination was solely a consequence of reduced bacterial
growth, we examined a hypoinflammatory state caused by knockdown of an enzyme
involved in eicosanoid biosynthesis, Lta4h28. Lta4h knockdown increased burden, limited
angiogenesis and also decreased dissemination, suggesting a role for angiogenesis in
dissemination independent of burden (Extended Data 5H).

We hypothesised that reduced bacterial growth due to decreased oxygen availability may
contribute to overall reduced burdens. Pazopanib treatment resulted in an increased number
of phd3-positive granulomas (Figure 3C and Extended Data 5I). Moreover, pazopanib
treatment increased the effectiveness of metronidazole (Figure 3D). These results suggest
that angiogenesis is an important modulator of oxygen availability for infecting
mycobacteria and that its limitation can enhance the efficacy of therapies targeting hypoxia.
Metronidazole has only marginal therapeutic efficacy in human tuberculosis29; our results
suggest combining it or related compounds with VEGFR inhibitors that increase the hypoxic
environment. Finally, we showed that targeting of VEGFR signalling could complement the
first-line antitubercular drug rifampicin: combination of rifampicin and SU5416 resulted in
decreased burden compared to either drug alone (Figure 3E).

We next addressed the therapeutic effectiveness of VEGFR inhibition in adult animals. We
infected with a range of mycobacterial doses from 400–8000 CFU via intraperitoneal
injection, treated with pazopanib, and observed survival. Over seventeen days, pazopanib
treatment increased survival in animals infected with high doses (4000 and 8000 CFU) of M.
marinum, but there was not yet appreciable mortality in the low-dose infection (Figure 4A).
At a dose of 500 CFU, where significant mortality was not observed in the first three weeks,
we observed granulomas that were completely cellular as well as ones that had developed
necrotic cores by two weeks post-infection (Extended Data 6A). Many adult granulomas
were hypoxic, as assessed by pimonidazole treatment and staining. Staining was largely
specific to granulomas and was concentrated in the cellular rim of the necrotic area, a
pattern similar to that seen in macaques19 (Figure 4B and Extended Data 6B).

Author Manuscript

Pazopanib treatment increased the mean distance of granulomas to the nearest vasculature
(Extended Data 6C). As in larvae, treatment resulted in reduced bacterial burdens, with a
mean 4-fold reduction relative to control animals over two weeks (Figure 4C). In week-old
established infections, pazopanib treatment for one week resulted in a mean 8-fold reduction
in burden (Extended Data 6D).

Author Manuscript

After six weeks of treatment, vascularisation was still significantly reduced relative to
controls (Extended Data 7A). Notably, there was an increased fraction of low-burden or
sterile granulomas in the pazopanib-treated animals (Figure 4D and Extended Data 7B). In
addition, the drug-treated animals displayed an increased fraction of hypoxic granulomas,
and there was an association of hypoxic granulomas with low-burden lesions (Extended
Data 7C and 7D). Many low-burden or sterilised hypoxic granulomas in the drug-treated
animals had acellular necrotic central areas (Extended Data 6A and 7B). Studies of caseous
tuberculous granulomas that are sterile in asymptomatic humans suggest that such an
outcome is possible even in the normal course of TB30.
We conclude that angiogenesis triggered by mycobacterial granulomas is an important
feature of mycobacterial pathogenesis and has significant consequences to infection
pathology and progression. We have shown that interception of this angiogenic program
using host-directed therapies can limit mycobacterial disease. These findings suggest the
potential utility of host-targeting anti-angiogenic agents as adjunctive therapies.

Methods
Zebrafish handling
All zebrafish husbandry and experimental procedures were performed in accordance and
compliance with policies approved by the Duke University Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (protocol A180-11-07). Clutches of eggs were collected from natural
spawning and raised in filtered fish system water at 28°. Pigment development was halted in
1 dpf embryos by the addition of 1-phenyl-2-thiourea (PTU; Sigma-Aldrich; final
concentration 45 μg/mL). Unless otherwise indicated, all zebrafish are from the wild-type
AB strain.
Infection by microinjection

Author Manuscript

Embryos were anesthetised at 2 dpf (or 1 dpf for morphants) with tricaine (MS-222; SigmaAldrich; final concentration 160 μg/mL) and injected with approximately 200 CFU M.
marinum or E. coli in an injection bolus of 10–20 nl as shown in Figure 1B. Infected
embryos were then recovered back to filtered fish system water supplemented with PTU.
Embryos that were physically damaged by injection handling were discarded and excluded
from further analysis.
Live imaging

Author Manuscript

Conventional and time-lapse fluorescent microscopy was carried out on a Zeiss Observer Z1
inverted microscope. Embryos were anesthetised with tricaine and mounted in 3% (w/v)
methylcellulose for static microscopy. Embryos for time-lapse microscopy were
anesthetised with 120 μg/mL tricaine, mounted in 0.75% low melting point agarose in 96
well plates and immersed in filtered fish system water supplemented with PTU. Confocal
microscopy was performed with an Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope. Images were
processed with ImageJ (NIH), Photoshop CS4 (Adobe) and Volocity 5.4 image analysis
software (Improvision/PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences).
Image analysis
Abnormal vascular length was measured as the 2 dimensional length of vessels not seen in
control embryos in Photoshop using the ruler tool. Infection burden and neutrophil units
were measured as the number of pixels above background per embryo in ImageJ using
binary thresholding of single channel images and the Analyze Particles function.
Macrophage association was scored as having mpeg:tomato-caax expression around sites of
M. marinum-wasabi expression. Dissemination was scored by comparing images of infected
larvae at 4 and 6 dpi to track M. marinum infection foci.

morpholino sequence 5′ AGCTAGGGTCTGAAACTGGAGTCAT3′. Morpholinos were
injected at 10–60 μM.
Drug treatments

Author Manuscript

Metronidazole (M1547; Sigma-Aldrich; final concentration 5 mM) was dissolved in water,
the relatively high concentration of metronidazole seems to be a function of bioavailability
in zebrafish as higher concentrations are routinely required for nitroreductase mediated
cellular ablation studies38. Pazopanib (sc-364564; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; final
concentration 250 nM for larvae, 1 μM for adults) and SU5416 (S8442; Sigma-Aldrich; final
concentration 250 nM) were dissolved in DMSO. Metronidazole, pazopanib, SU5416 were
added immediately after infection and refreshed every two days for the duration of the
experiment. Randomisation into drug treatment groups was achieved by random selection of
infected zebrafish from a single pool prior to addition of drugs.
Microangiography
To detect vascular leakiness in wild type and Tg(flk1:EGFP) embryos and ectopic
vasculature in WHIM embryos, embryos were anesthetised in tricaine water and injected
with a 10 nl bolus of Dextran-Texas Red 70,000 MW (D-1830; Life Technologies; 1 mg/ml
final concentration) into the posterior section of the dorsal aorta or posterior cardinal vein.
This injection location avoided injection trauma-induced tissue leakage occurring near M.
marinum lesions. Injected embryos were rinsed in tricaine water and immediately mounted
in methylcellulose for fluorescent microscopy. Vascular leakage was calculated as a ratio of
intersomitic dextran-Texas red signal divided by aortic dextran-Texas red signal.

Combined drug treatments
Rifampicin (R3501; Sigma-Aldrich; final concentration 50 μM) was dissolved in DMSO. To
achieve a suboptimal dose of VEGFR inhibition, SU5416 was added immediately after
infection at a final concentration of 200 nM and refreshed at 3 dpi. Rifampicin was added at
3 dpi and not refreshed for the duration of the experiment.
Metronidazole (final concentration 5 mM) and pazopanib (suboptimal final concentration
200 nM) were added immediately after infection and refreshed every two days for the
duration of the experiment.
Adult infections

Author Manuscript

Adult zebrafish were infected with approximately 500 CFU of fluorescent M. marinum via
intra peritoneal injection. Zebrafish were maintained in beakers in a dedicated incubator at
28° with a 14:10 hour light:dark cycle. Pazopanib was added to a final concentration of 1
μM immediately after infection and refreshed every two days for the duration of the
experiment.

Bacterial recovery from infected adults

Author Manuscript

Infected adult zebrafish pretreated with 25 μg/ml hygromycin to reduce microbiota load for
two hours prior to harvesting. Zebrafish were euthanised by tricaine overdose and
homogenised by bead mill for three bursts of 15 seconds. Homogenate was plated on
Middlebrook 7H10 (262710; Difco) supplemented with OADC, hygromycin (H0654;
Sigma-Aldrich, 50 μg/l) and amphotericin B (SV3007801; Thermo Scientific, 10 mg/l).
Plates were grown at 30° for 10–14 days until fluorescent colonies could be counted.
Hypoxyprobe staining

Author Manuscript

Infected adult zebrafish were injected with 15 μl of a 10 mg/ml pimonidazole solution (HP7;
Hypoxyprobe) every two days from 8 dpi to 14 dpi. Zebrafish were euthanised by tricaine
overdose at 14 dpi, fixed in 4% PFA, decalcified in 0.5M EDTA and cyrosectioned. Frozen
sections were stained with 4.3.1.3 mouse Dylight 549-MAb (HP7; Hypoxyprobe) or with
unconjugated 4.3.1.3 mouse MAb and secondary detection with goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor 647 (A-21235; Life Technologies) to detect hypoxic cells.
