ABSTRACT
The deletion of 12p (del(12p)) has been described as a novel negative prognostic
marker in multiple myeloma (MM) and has gained increasing attention in recent years.
However, its impact on MM is still controversial. In this study, we comprehensively
evaluated the clinical impact of 12p13 deletion using fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH) on 275 newly diagnosed MM cases treated in a prospective, non-randomized
clinical trial (BDH 2008/02). The results showed that deletion of 12p13 was detected
in 10.5% of newly diagnosed cases and associated with multiple indicators for
high tumor burden including ISS III, BM plasmacytosis larger than 50%, and renal
lesion. Moreover, the cases with 12p13 deletion typically had higher incidence of
del(17p), IGH translocation and t(4;14). Patients with del(12p) conferred significantly
adverse prognosis for PFS and OS, even in patients subjected to bortezomib-based
therapy. When adjusted to the established prognostic variables including del(13q),
del(17p), t(4;14), amp(1q21), ISS stage and LDH, del(12p13) remained the powerful
independent adverse factor for PFS (P = 0.007) and OS (P = 0.032). In addition,
del(12p13) combined with high β2-MG, high LDH and bone lesion can further identify
subpopulations with high-risk features. Our results strongly supported that del(12p13)
can be used as a valuable prognostic marker in MM.

Working Group (IMWG) in recent years [2, 3]. Routine
evaluation factors consist of deletion of 17p (del(17p)),
t(4;14) and t(14;16) detected by fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) [4], however, none of these factors
can completely explain the heterogeneity in this disease.
New techniques such as single-nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP)-based mapping array and array comparative genomic
hybridization (aCGH) can provide a deeper knowledge of
the diversity and heterogeneity of cytogenetic abnormalities
in MM [5, 6]. So, the question of identifying some noval

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM), a neoplasm of plasma cells,
is characterized by complex chromosomal abnormalities.
The cytogenetic abnormalities are the hallmark of MM and
commonly used as the clinical predictors for determining
the stage of disease and providing the guidance for
therapeutic strategies [1]. Risk-stratification system
based on genetic indicators has been established and
recommended by mayo clinic and International Myeloma

prognostic factors to better risk stratify patients in the
management of myeloma is becoming an important issue.
Chromosome 12p deletion has been recently reported
to exist in approximately 10% of MM patients and reveals
poor prognosis [7, 8]. However, the practical prognostic
value of del(12p) in MM remains controversial. Although
it has been identified by using FISH in several studies [5],
the failed confirmation is still observed in other series of
studies [9, 10]. Moreover, the status of 12p aberration in
MM and other plasma cell disorders are still unclear.
CD27 gene, a member of the tumor necrosis factor
receptor (TNFR) family, is regarded as a putative disease
related gene located in 12p13.31. Zhan et al. have disclosed
that the low expression of CD27 could predict high-risk
value by gene expression profiling (GEP) in MM [11].
Other studies have also confirmed this viewpoint by flow
cytometry and immunohistochemical analysis [12, 13].
In order to explore the status of 12p deletion in MM and
other plasma cell disorders and its prognostic value, a
cohort of 275 patients with newly diagnosed MM from a
prospective, non-randomized clinical trial (BDH 2008/02)
has been analyzed by detection 12p13.31 using FISH in this
study. Similarly, in order to compare the incidence of 12p
aberration among different stages of plasma cell dyscrasias,
the patients including 90 relapsed MM, 8 secondary plasma
cell leukemia (sPCL) and 7 monoclonal gammopathy of
undetermined significance (MGUS) were enrolled.

(P = 0.008). The comparison of deletion/gain rate in patients
with plasma cell dyscrasias was shown in Figure 1A and 1B.

The deletion of 12p13 is associated with multiple
factors for high tumor burden and negative
outcome in newly diagnosed MM
Clinical factors and genetic abnormalities associated
with del(12p) were shown in Table 2. From these data,
we found that del(12p) was significantly correlated with
many factors for high tumor burden including ISS III
(P = 0.006), BM plasmacytosis larger than 50% (P = 0.034),
and renal lesion (P = 0.039). Moreover, cases with 12p13
deletion typically had a higher incidence of del(17p) (39.3%
vs. 8.8%, P < 0.001), IGH translocation (75.0% vs. 55.3%, P
= 0.048) and t(4;14) (38.5% vs. 18.5%, P = 0.019). We defined
patients with the abnormalities of t(4;14), t(14;16) or del(17p)
as high-risk MM according to Intergroup Francophone du
Myeloma (IFM) stratification of the myeloma model, a higher
incidence of high-risk genetic abnormalities was observed in
patients with del(12p13) (62.1% vs. 30.4%, P = 0.001).

Prognostic value of 12p13 deletion in newly
diagnosed MM patients
Follow-up data from 241 patients were analyzed to
ascertain the prognostic value of 12p13 deletion in newly
diagnosed MM patients. Totally 34 patients did not complete
the follow-up examination due to poor contact information.
The results showed that patients with del(12p) had
significantly shortened PFS (11.0 vs. 24.0 months, P < 0.001)
and OS (17.0 vs. 40.0 months, P < 0.001) than the patients
without del(12p) (Figure 2A and 2B). In addition, we also
investigated the impact of 12p13 gain on survival; however,
no prognosis significance of 12p13 gain was observed in the
present study. We further analyzed other risk factors that might
affect the prognosis of this series of patients. Based on the
univariate analysis shown in Table 3, patients with ISS stage
III, LDH higher than 220 U/L, del(13q), del(17p), t(4;14),
amp(1q21) and high-risk genetic abnormality had inferior
survival than the control group. In multivariate analysis,
when adjusted to the above prognostic variables, del(12p13)
remained the powerful independent adverse factor for PFS
(HR 2.29, 95% CI: 1.25–4.18, P = 0.007) and OS (HR 2.11,
95% CI: 1.07–4.17, P = 0.032). The other two independent
factors were del(17p) (PFS: HR 2.50, 95% CI: 1.42–4.38,
P = 0.001; OS: HR 1.90, 95% CI: 0.99–3.68, P = 0.050) and
amp(1q21) (PFS: HR 2.67, 95% CI: 1.68–4.24, P < 0.001;
OS: HR 1.91, 95% CI: 1.13–3.24, P = 0.016) (Table 4).

RESULTS
Patient’s characteristics
A total of 275 newly diagnosed MM patients were
subjected to the detection of 12p13 deletion. The median
age of the patients was 58 years old (range, 26–83 yr)
with the median follow-up time of 36 months from the
diagnosis. Patients including 90-relapsed MM, 8 sPCL
and 7 MGUS were enrolled for the analysis to compare
the incidence of 12p aberration among different stages of
plasma cell dyscrasias. The clinical characteristics of 275
patients in arm A and arm B were shown in Table 1. There
was no significant difference in clinical and cytogenetic
characteristics between both groups.

Chromosome 12p13 aberration in plasma cell
dyscrasias
In this series of 380 patients, the deletion of 12p13
was detected in 29 (10.5%) of 275 newly diagnosed and
13 (14.4%) of 90 relapsed patients (P = 0.314). Moreover,
in patients with sPCL, 37.5% (3/8) of patients with 12p13
deletion were detected and revealed higher deletion rate than
newly diagnosed and relapsed patients (P = 0.008, 0.051).
However, none of 7 MGUS patients had this deletion.
Interestingly, we also found that 4.4% (12/275) of newly
diagnosed and 12.2% (11/90) of relapsed patients had 12p13
gain and revealed the higher gain rate in relapsed patients

DISCUSSION

high LDH or bone lesion was a good predictor marker for
dividing patients into subpopulations with different OS
time (Table 5). Patients with del(12p) and high β2-MG had
inferior outcome for PFS (12.0 vs. 21.0 vs. 26.0 months,
P =  0.003) and OS (22.0 vs. 30.0 vs. 54.0 months, P < 0.001)
than patients with del(12p) or high β2-MG and patients
without del(12p) and high β2-MG (Figure 3A and 3B).
A similar analysis for the prediction of OS was also
performed on the parameters of high LDH and bone lesion
(Figure 3C–3F). In addition, patients with del(12p) and
high LDH at the same time had a very aggressive clinical
course with the OS time from 1.0 month to 23.5 months.
Among 8 patients, 5 patients received bortezomib-based
chemotherapy and 3 patients received thalidomide-based
chemotherapy; however, possibly due to the limited number
and short follow-up time in these patients, the median
estimated PFS and OS for patients with del(12p) and high
LDH at the same time were only 1.0 and 1.5 months.

The deletion of chromosome 12p was reported as a
novel independent poor prognostic predictor in 192 newly
diagnosed patients using SNP-based array in 2009 and
has garnered increased attention in recent years [5, 7, 8].
Although the result is subsequently validated in a cohort
of 273 patients with myeloma [14], two studies are failed
to confirm this using a FISH probe covering the similar
chromosome region [9, 10]. So, the prognostic value
of del(12p) in MM patients remains controversial and
routine testing for del(12p) has not currently accepted by
the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) [3].
This study has focused on the status of 12p abnormality
in plasma cell dyscrasias and comprehensively evaluated
the prognostic value of del(12p) in newly diagnosed MM
patients in the background of the novel agent-based therapy.
According to our current knowledge, the abnormality
of 12p13 in myeloma patients by FISH has been only
mentioned in several studies. The prevalence of 12p
deletion (10.5%) in our cohort is consistent with previous
reports with 13%, 8% and 11% of 12p deletion, respectively
[5, 9, 10]. In addition, the higher deletion rate of 12p is
observed in relapsed (14.4% vs.10.5%, P = 0.314) and
sPCL (37.5% vs. 10.5%, P = 0.008) patients than newly
diagnosed patients. However, no patients with MGUS have
12p deletion. Interestingly, we have also found that 4.4%
of newly diagnosed and 12.2% of relapsed patients have
12p gain (P = 0.007). The mechanism of higher incidence
of 12p disorders in the advanced stage of MM and sPCL
remains unclear, which is possibly due to the chromosomal
instability in the progression of plasma cell dyscrasias.
We have further explored the correlation between
del(12p) and other clinical parameters in newly diagnosed
MM patients. To our surprise, del(12p) is significantly
associated with high tumor burden-related indicators
including ISS III, BM plasmacytosis higher than 50%,
and renal lesion. β2-MG, a good marker reflected tumor
burden, is defined as ISS III at the level of larger than
5.5 mg/dL; however, the level of β2-MG is usually
influenced by renal lesion. Thus, we further analyzed
the correlation between del(12p) and β2-MG excluding

Bortezomib did not significantly improve the
survival of patients with del(12p)
In thalidomide-based chemotherapy group (arm
A), the median PFS and OS of patients with del(12p)
were 12.0 vs. 21.0 months (P = 0.059) and 17.0 vs. 26.0
months (P = 0.026) when compared to patients without
del(12p). In bortezomib-based chemotherapy group (arm
B), the median PFS and OS of patients with del(12p) were
9.0 vs. 31.0 months (P = 0.001) and 21 vs. not reached
(P < 0.001) when compared to patients without del(12p).
In addition, in patients without del(12p), the median
PFS and OS of patients treated with bortezomib-based
chemotherapy were 31.0 vs. 21.0 months (P = 0.008) and
not reached vs. 26.0 months (P < 0.001) when compared
to patients treated with thalidomide-based chemotherapy
(Figure 4A and 4B). However, in patients with del(12p),
no statistically significant difference between bortezomibbased and thalidomide-based chemotherapy groups was
observed (PFS: P = 0.624; OS: P = 0.891) (Figure 4C
and 4D). It suggests that bortezomib-based chemotherapy
could obviously improve the survival of patients without
del(12p), but not overcome the negative impact of del(12p).

patients with β2-MG higher than 5.5 mg/dL and renal lesion
simultaneously, the strong correlation remains existence
(P = 0.025). In addition, we have also found that cases with
12p deletion have a obviously higher incidence of highrisk genetic aberrations including del(17p) and t(4;14).
In contrast, Jiang et al. have detected the 12p deletion
in 88 newly diagnosed MM patients, and do not observe
the association between 12p deletion and 13q deletion or
t(4;14), but their results also support our finding that MM
and sPCL cases with 12p deletion tended to have more
frequency of del(17p) when compared to patients without
del(12p) (42.0% vs.11% in MM and 75.0% vs. 50.0% in
sPCL, respectively) [9]. The discrepancy is possibly due to
the small size of the samples in Jiang’s investigation. Our
results have demonstrated that 12p deletion is a secondary
event rather than a primary event associated with disease
progression and high tumor burden in MM.
The prognostic impact of 12p deletion on MM
patients in several different cohorts remains inconsistent.
Avet-Loiseau et al. have identified the loss of 12p as an
independent poor prognostic factor for PFS and OS in
newly diagnosed MM using SNP-based array (192 cases)
and FISH (273 cases) [5]. However, an analysis of 256

P value

newly diagnosed MM patients from the Medical Research
Council (MRC) Myeloma IX trial presents no statistically
significant difference (P = 0.061), although a trend for
shorter overall OS time in patients with del(12p13)
(3.33 vs. 4.18 years) is observed [10]. Furthermore, results
from Jiang’s investigation have described that patients with
and without del(12p) have similar PFS (median 23.5 vs. 21.9
months, P = 0.616) and OS (median 44.5 vs. 91.4 months,
P = 0.105) [9]. Our results are comparable with the report
from Avet-Loiseau, and have demonstrated that patients
with del(12p13) have remarkably shorter PFS (11.0 vs.
24.0 months, P < 0.001) and OS (17.0 vs. 40.0 months, P
< 0.001) than patients without del(12p13). In multivariate
analysis, del(12p13) still remains its independent prognostic
significance for PFS (HR 2.29, 95% CI: 1.25–4.18,
P = 0.007) and OS (HR 2.11, 95% CI: 1.07–4.17, P = 0.032).
Strikingly, as the prognostic model including del(12p),
β2-MG and amp(5q31.3) suggested from Avet-Loiseau’s
investigation, we also have found that del(12p) combined
with high β2-MG, high LDH or bone lesion is a good
predictor marker for dividing patients into subpopulations
with different OS time, especially, the patients with del(12p)
and high LDH at the same time have a very aggressive

or bortezomib-based therapy. (A–B) In patients without del(12p13), PFS (P = 0.008) and OS (P < 0.001) were obviously improved
after receiving bortezomib-based therapy compared to patients receiving thalidomide-based therapy. (C–D) However, in patients with
del(12p13), patients with thalidomide-based and bortezomib-based therapy had similar PFS (P = 0.624) and OS (P = 0.891) , suggesting
that bortezomib-based therapy could not improve the poor survival of patients with del(12p13).

clinical course and high mortality rate. These results strongly
support that del(12p) is a powerful prognostic marker for
defining subpopulation with high-risk features.
Finally, our data have shown that the negative
outcome of del(12p) could not be obviously improved by
bortezomib-based therapy, suggesting that del(12p) may
mediate the resistance to bortezomib-based therapy. Zhan
et al. have first disclosed that CD27 located in 12p13.31 is
one of the most significantly under-expressed genes in MM
[11]. Davies et al. have subsequently conformed that the
down-regulation of CD27 is linked to process from normal
through MGUS to MM [15]. Moreau et al. have evaluated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

CD27 expression on normal plasma cells (PCs), PCs from
MM patients at diagnosis or relapse and human myeloma
cell lines (HMCL) using flow cytometry. The results have
revealed that CD27 is expressed by normal PCs, but is
lacking in PCs from MM patients at diagnosis (36%), relapse
(47%) and HMCL (92%), and patients with CD27 negative
have poor survival [16]. All of these results support that
CD27 gene may play an important role in MM progression.
As a member of the TNFR superfamily, CD27 provides costimulatory signals for the proliferation of T- and B-cells
and immunoglobulin production and apoptosis of B-cells
[17]. Down-regulation of CD27 gene in MM may prevent

apoptotic program mediated by interleukin 10 (IL-10) [18].
Moreover, CD27 activates both the classical and alternative
nuclear factor-κB pathways and the under-expression
of CD27 in CD-1 myeloma subgroup is reported to be
associated with a lower NF-κB signature when compared
to CD-2 myeloma subgroup [19, 20]. These results could
explain that bortezomib-based therapy targeting the NF-κB
pathway may not overcome the negative impact on patients
with del(12p), and further studies are necessary to disclose
the underlying mechanisms.
In conclusion, del(12p) is heterogeneous and
associated with high tumor burden in myeloma. Patients
with del(12p13) had adverse prognosis and were resistant to
bortezomib-based therapy. Del(12p13) combined with other
markers including high β2-MG, high LDH, and bone lesion
can further identify patients with high-risk features. So, we
suggest all newly diagnosed MM patients should be routinely

(RP11–72G18). FISH analysis was performed as previous
report [21]. For each probe, 200 plasma cells were scored
and the cut-off level was set at 20% for both deletion
and amplification according to the recommendation of
European Myeloma Network (EMN) [22].

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS
version 19.0 software. Progression-free survival (PFS)
was calculated from the date of diagnosis until disease
progression or death, and overall survival (OS) was
calculated from the date of diagnosis until death. Comparison
of categorical variables was conducted by chi-square test and
non-parametric test. Survival curves were plotted using the
Kaplan-Meier method. Differences between curves were
tested for statistical significance using the log-rank test.
Multivariate analysis of variables associated with survival
was conducted by Cox Proportional-Hazard model for
both PFS and OS. A statistically significant difference was
considered atP ≤ 0.05.

METHODS
Patients and samples

Acknowledgments

All newly diagnosed MM patients were derived
from a prospective, non-randomized clinical trial (BDH
2008/02). The trial was approved by the ethic committee of
the Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical
Sciences, and Peking Union Medical College, according to
the guidelines of the 1996 Helsinki Declaration. Patients
were homogeneously provided with thalidomide-based
(arm A) or bortezomib-based (arm B) treatment according
to our previous report [21]. Arm A consisted of TAD
(thalidomide, adriamycin and dexamethasone) or TCD
(thalidomide, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone);
Arm B consisted of BCD (bortezomib, cyclophosphamide
and dexamethasone) or PAD (bortezomib, adriamycin and
dexamethasone). After at least four cycles of treatments
with partial remission or better efficacy, patients underwent
consolidation therapy with the patient’s original regimen.
Subsequently, patients were treated with thalidomide
(100–150 mg/d) for one year to maintain response.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization
Mononuclear cells from patients with MM were
separated by gradient density centrifugation (FicollHypaque; Eurobio, Les Ulis, France). Plasma cells
were then purified using CD138-coated magnetic beads
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi
Biotec, Germany), thus enabling plasma cell purity
higher than 90%. Plasma cells were then assessed using
DNA probes specific for the following chromosomal
aberrations: del(13q14), del(17p), amp(1q21), IgH
translocation, t(11;14), t(4;14), and t(14;16). Del(12p) was
assessed using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)
probe specific for 12p13.31 region covered CD27 gene
