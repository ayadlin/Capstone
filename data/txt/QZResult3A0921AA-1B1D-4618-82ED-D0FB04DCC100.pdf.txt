key KRAS effectors has been thwarted by activation of compensatory or parallel pathways that
limit their efficacy as single agents. Here we take a systematic approach towards identifying
combination targets for trametinib, an FDA-approved MEK inhibitor that acts downstream of
KRAS to suppress signaling through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade.
Informed by a short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen, we show that trametinib provokes a
compensatory response involving the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) that leads to
signaling rebound and adaptive drug resistance. As a consequence, genetic or pharmacologic
inhibition of FGFR1 in combination with trametinib enhances tumor cell death in vitro and in
vivo. This compensatory response shows distinct specificities – it is dominated by FGFR1 in
KRAS mutant lung and pancreatic cancer cells, but is not activated or involves other mechanisms
in KRAS wild-type lung and KRAS-mutant colon cancer cells. Importantly, KRAS-mutant lung
cancer cells and patient tumors treated with trametinib show an increase in FRS2 phosphorylation,
a biomarker of FGFR activation; this increase is abolished by FGFR1 inhibition and correlates
with sensitivity to trametinib and FGFR inhibitor combinations. These results demonstrate that
FGFR1 can mediate adaptive resistance to trametinib and validate a combinatorial approach for
treating KRAS-mutant lung cancer.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

KRAS encodes a GTPase that couples growth factor signaling to the MAPK cascade and
other effector pathways. Oncogenic KRAS mutations compromise its GTPase activity
leading to accumulation of KRAS in the active GTP-bound state, thereby leading to
hyperactive signaling that initiates and maintains tumorigenesis1. Owing to the high
frequency of KRAS mutations in lung adenocarcinoma and other cancers, strategies to
inhibit the KRAS protein or exploit synthetic lethal interactions with a mutant KRAS gene
have been widely pursued but have been fraught with technical challenges or produced
inconsistent results2–7. Conversely, strategies to target key RAS effectors including MAPK
pathway components RAF, MEK, and ERK have been hindered by toxicities associated with
their sustained inhibition and/or adaptive resistance mechanisms8–11.

shRNA screen for identifying trametinib sensitizers

Author Manuscript

Hypothesizing that sustained MAPK inhibition is necessary, but not sufficient, for targeting
KRAS-mutant cancers, we performed a pool-based shRNA screen to identify genes whose
inhibition sensitizes KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells to the FDA-approved MEK inhibitor
trametinib (Supplementary Table 1). A customized shRNA library targeting the human
kinome was introduced into the TRMPVIN vector that we previously optimized for negative
selection screening12,13. In this system, cassettes encoding a mir-30 shRNA linked to a
dsRed fluorescent reporter are placed downstream of a tetracycline responsive promoter,
enabling doxycycline dependent gene silencing and the facile tracking and/or sorting of
shRNA expressing cells (Extended Data 1a)12. This library was transduced into H23
KRASG12C mutant lung cancer cells expressing a reverse-tet-transactivator (rtTA3). The
transduced populations were then treated with doxycycline in the presence or absence of 25
nM trametinib, a dose that effectively inhibits ERK signaling without substantially affecting
proliferation (Extended Data Fig.1b, c, d, e). After ten population doublings, changes in

shRNA representation were determined by sequencing of shRNAs amplified from dsRedsorted cells (Extended Data Fig.1b).
As expected, shRNAs targeting essential genes (RPA1 and CDK11A) were strongly depleted
in both vehicle and trametinib-treated cells, whereas the relative representation of neutral
non-targeting control shRNAs (Renilla (REN)) remained unchanged (Fig. 1a and Extended
Data Fig. 1f, g). Using selection criteria that required an average 4-fold or greater depletion
between conditions, we identified 64 shRNAs corresponding to 53 genes that were
selectively depleted upon MEK inhibition in trametinib-treated compared to untreated cells
(Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig.1h). Of these, shRNAs targeting the 8 genes for which
multiple shRNAs identified as hits were validated using cell competition assays in multiple
KRAS-mutant lung lines. These studies identified BRAF, CRAF, ERK2, and FGFR1 as the
top candidates in our screen (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 2a).

Trametinib has superior pharmacologic properties compared to other MEK inhibitors
because it impairs feedback reactivation of ERK10. Still, the fact that MAPK components
were identified as hits in our screen implied that pathway reactivation eventually occurs.
Indeed, although trametinib stably inhibits ERK signaling at 48-hours – a time where
rebound occurs with other agents10 - we observed an increase in phospho-ERK after 6–12
days of drug exposure (Fig. 1c). This rebound was reduced by subsequently increasing the
concentration of trametinib, indicating that it is MEK dependent (Extended Data Fig. 2b).
Accordingly, inducible knockdown of ERK2, CRAF, and BRAF blocked ERK signaling
rebound and reduced clonogenic growth after trametinib treatment (Fig. 1d and Extended
Data Fig. 2c, d). Similar effects were observed in KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells treated
with trametinib and the ERK inhibitor SCH772984 (Fig. 1e, f, and Extended Data Fig. 3)14.
These observations underscore the marked dependency of KRAS-mutant tumors on the
MAPK signaling pathway.
In agreement with other studies, KRAS-mutant cells treated with trametinib also displayed
compensatory activation of the PI3K and JAK/STAT pathways as assessed by AKT and
STAT3 phosphorylation, respectively (Fig. 1d, e, g and Extended Data Fig. 2c, 3b, 4a)11,15.
Although the increase in STAT3 phosphorylation was transient (Extended Data Fig. 4a),
AKT phosphorylation was sustained (Fig. 1g). In contrast to their effects on ERK signaling
rebound, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of MAPK signaling had little effect on the
trametinib-induced increase in pAKT (Fig. 1d, e, and Extended Data Fig. 2c, 3b). The
activation of multiple signaling pathways following trametinib-treatment likely reflects a
relief in pleiotropic feedback mechanisms produced by hyperactive RAS signaling in
KRAS-mutant cells8,9.

FGFR1 mediates adaptive drug resistance
Several RTKs have been implicated in adaptive resistance to RAS pathway
antagonist8,9,11,15–20. The identification of FGFR1 shRNAs as trametinib sensitizers raised
the possibility that FGFR1 mediates MAPK and PI3K activation in trametinib-treated
KRAS-mutant cells. In agreement, treatment of KRAS-mutant lung tumor cell lines with
trametinib increased FGFR1 receptor and/or ligand expression together with FGFR pathway

activation as assessed by an increase in phosphorylation of the FGFR adaptor protein FRS2
(Fig. 2a, b, and Extended Data Fig. 2b, 4b, c, d, e)21. In turn, FGFR1 activation correlated
with an increase in the levels of RAS-GTP, phospho-AKT, and phospho-ERK (Fig. 2b and
Extended Data Fig. 4e), which was prevented by FGFR1 knockdown (Fig. 2c). Accordingly,
FGFR1 shRNAs did not inhibit the proliferation of KRAS-mutant lung cancer, but displayed
synergistic inhibitory effects when combined with trametinib (Fig. 2d, e, and Extended Data
Fig. 4f, g).

Author Manuscript

The combinatorial effects of FGFR1 inhibition and trametinib showed distinct specificities:
for example, shRNAs targeting FGFR1 or FRS2, but not those targeting FGFR2 and 3,
sensitized KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells to trametinib (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 4h,
i). By contrast, FGFR1 knockdown had little impact on trametinib sensitivity in KRAS wildtype lung cancer cells (Fig. 2g). While FGFR1 shRNAs synergized with trametinib in two
KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancer cell lines, they showed little activity in trametinib-treated
KRAS-mutant colorectal lines (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Importantly, this genotype and
tissue specificity correlated with the ability of trametinib to trigger FRS2 phosphorylation
when applied as a single agent (Extended Data Fig. 5b, c, d). Therefore, treatment of certain
KRAS-mutant tumor types with trametinib induces a dependency on FGFR1 signaling that
promotes adaptive drug resistance.

FGFR1 inhibition enhances trametinib effects

Author Manuscript

We next tested whether therapeutic strategies combining trametinib with an FGFR1 inhibitor
could be effective in treating some KRAS-mutant lung cancers by combining trametinib
with ponatinib, an FDA-approved multikinase inhibitor that inhibits FGFR1 and is being
tested clinically for activity against FGFR1-amplified lung cancer (Extended Data Fig.
6a)22,23. Ponatinib had little effect on KRAS-mutant cells but countered the trametinibinduced increase in pFRS2, pERK, and pAKT, and synergized with trametinib in inhibiting
cell proliferation (Fig. 3a, b, c, and Extended Data Fig. 6b, c, d, e). As observed in our
genetic studies, this combination also showed combined activity in human KRAS-mutant
pancreatic cancer cells and a Kras-mutant murine lung adenocarcinoma line (Extended Data
Fig. 7a, b, c), but to a lesser extent in KRAS wild-type lung cancer cells or KRAS-mutant
colon cancer cells (Fig. 3c). Although it remains possible that the synergistic effects of this
combination involve ponatinib’s ability to target additional kinases, similar results were
observed with two other chemically-distinct FGFR inhibitors (Extended Data Fig. 7d, e,
8a)24,25. Importantly, sensitivity to the combination of trametinib and FGFR inhibition
correlated with the degree of pFRS2 induction after trametinib treatment (Extended Data
Fig. 8b, c).

Author Manuscript

While our genetic and pharmacologic studies establish the importance of the MAPK
pathway in adaptive resistance to trametinib, we reasoned that the compensatory increase in
PI3K/AKT signaling also plays a role and that its inhibition by ponatinib contributes to the
effects of this drug combination. Accordingly, PTEN knockdown, which can increase PI3K
signaling independently of RTK activation, promoted partial resistance to the drug
combination in KRAS-mutant H2030 cells. This effect was not observed in H460 cells, a
KRAS-mutant line that also harbors an activating mutation in the p110α catalytic subunit of

PI3K (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 9a, b, c). Consistent with a role for PI3K signaling in
promoting cell survival, co-treatment of H23 cells with trametinib and ponatinib triggered
substantial apoptosis in a manner that was not observed following treatment with trametinib
alone or in combination with an ERK inhibitor (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 9d). Thus,
the combined ability of ponatinib to impact reactivation of the MAPK and PI3K pathways
contributes to its combinatorial activity in KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells.

Author Manuscript

We also tested whether other RTKs known to be reactivated following MAPK inhibition
contribute to adaptive resistance to trametinib in KRAS-mutant lung cancer
cells8,9,11,16–20,26,27. While trametinib treatment of H23 and H2030 cells increased MET
and ERBB2 (but not EGFR) levels (Extended Data Fig. 9e, f, g), inhibitors targeting these
kinases did not synergize with trametinib under the conditions tested (Fig. 3f, Extended Data
Fig. 9h, 10a, b). Consistent with previous reports11, the dual EGFR/ERBB2 inhibitor
afatinib also showed combinatorial activity with trametinib in some KRAS-mutant lung
cancer lines, though in our hands less robustly than the trametinib and ponatinib
combination (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 9h, 10a, b). Accordingly, none of the agents
tested prevented the rebound in ERK signaling following trametinib treatment (Fig. 3g and
Extended Data Fig. 10c, d). Thus, reactivation of FGFR1 signaling is a prominent
mechanism of adaptive resistance to trametinib in KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells.

MEK/FGFR1 inhibition induces KRAS-mutant tumor regression

Author Manuscript

We validated our in vitro results in KRAS-mutant lung cancer xenografts, a KRAS-mutant
patient-derived xenograft, and a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of KrasG12Dinduced lung adenocarcinoma that accurately resembles the human disease28. A549 and H23
xenografts harboring tet-responsive FGFR1- or control-shRNAs were treated with
doxycycline and a daily dose of 3 mg/kg of trametinib when tumors reached ~150 mm3.
While knockdown of FGFR1 or treatment with trametinib alone had only minor anti-tumor
effects, the combination of FGFR1 knockdown with trametinib potently inhibited tumor
growth and typically caused tumor regression (Extended Data Fig. 11a, b). Treatment of the
xenografts, PDX and GEMM models with vehicle, trametinib, ponatinib, or the drug
combination showed similar results, with only the combination producing marked tumor
regressions despite no apparent toxicities (Fig. 4a, b, c and Extended Data Fig. 11c, d, e).
Moreover, histological analysis of the residual tumor mass in GEMMs treated with the drug
combination showed massive necrosis, an effect not seen with either agent alone (Fig. 4d).
Similar results were observed in an organoid based, transplantable model of KrasG12Ddriven pancreatic cancer, in which the drug combination produced marked cell death and
significantly enhanced survival (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 11f).

Author Manuscript

We also examined the ability of trametinib to induce FGFR1 signaling in KRAS-mutant
tumors. Consistent with in vitro results, a KRAS-mutant lung PDX model showed a
concomitant increase in FRS2, ERK, and AKT phosphorylation following trametinib
treatment – an effect that was canceled by ponatinib (Fig. 5a and Extended Data Fig. 11g).
Furthermore, FRS2 phosphorylation was dramatically increased following trametinib
treatment in two KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma patients (Fig. 5b), indicating that the
mechanism of adaptive resistance identified in our preclinical models is clinically relevant.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

In summary, by implementing a stringent approach for negative selection shRNA screening,
we identified feedback activation of FGFR1 signaling as a prominent mechanism of adaptive
resistance to the MEK inhibitor trametinib in KRAS-mutant lung cancer. The mechanism
was specific: only shRNAs targeting FGFR1, but not other FGFR family members or other
RTKs tested conferred trametinib sensitivity, and only FGFR1 inhibition blocked
compensatory reactivation of both ERK and AKT. In agreement, an unbiased ORF screen
identified FGFR1, but not other RTKs, as sufficient to allow proliferation of KRAS-mutant
colon cancer cells following KRAS suppression29. In our hands, the synergistic effects of the
trametinib/FGFR inhibitor combinations were largely restricted to KRAS-mutant lung and
pancreatic cancer cells, but not KRAS wild-type lung or KRAS-mutant colon cancer cells.
These results strongly associate sensitivity to the combination with the magnitude of FRS2
phosphorylation following trametinib treatment alone and provide a mechanistic foothold to
predict and study cell line and tumor variability.

Author Manuscript

Our results provide strong mechanistic support for combining trametinib with FGFR1
inhibitors for treating KRAS-mutant lung cancer and pinpoint a biomarker that might
eventually be used to identify other patients likely to benefit from this drug combination.
Although careful attention to additive or synergistic toxicities will be required for the
clinical implementation of these findings, it seems likely that targeting a specific RTK such
as FGFR1 will be more tolerable than targeting more pleiotropic factors such as AKT30 and
presents a rationale for developing more specific FGFR1 antagonists. Regardless, our study
provides further evidence that targeting adaptive resistance mechanisms can improve the
efficacy of molecular targeted therapies and provides one path towards developing rational
strategies for treating KRAS-mutant lung cancer.

METHODS
Pooled negative-selection RNAi screening

Author Manuscript

A custom shRNA library targeting 526 human kinases was designed using miR30-adapted
DSIR predictions refined with “sensor” rules31 (six shRNAs per gene) and constructed by
PCR-cloning a pool of oligonucleotides synthesized on customized arrays (Agilent
Technologies and CustomArray) as previously described (Supplementary Table 1)12. The list
of genes was obtained from KinBase Database (http://kinase.com/human/kinome/) and was
manually curated. After sequence verification, 3156 shRNAs (5–6 per gene) were combined
with 20 positive- and negative-control shRNAs at equal concentrations in one pool. This
pool was subcloned into the TRMPV-Neo vector and transduced in triplicates into Tet-on
H23 KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells using conditions that predominantly lead to a single
retroviral integration and represent each shRNA in a calculated number of at least 1,000
cells. Transduced cells were selected for 6 days using 1 mg ml−1 G418 (Invitrogen); at each
passage more than 30 million transduced cells were maintained to preserve library
representation throughout the experiment. After drug selection, T0 samples were obtained
(~30 million cells per replicate (n = 3)) and cells were subsequently cultured in the presence
or absence of trametinib (25 nM) and 1 µg ml−1 doxycycline to induce shRNA expression.
After ten population doublings (Tf), about fifteen million shRNA-expressing (dsRed+/

Venus+) cells were sorted for each replicate using a FACSAriaII (BD Biosciences). Genomic
DNA from T0 and Tf samples was isolated by two rounds of phenol extraction using
PhaseLock tubes (5prime) followed by isopropanol precipitation. Deep-sequencing template
libraries were generated by PCR amplification of shRNA guide strands as previously
described12. Libraries were analyzed on an Illumina Genome Analyzer at a final
concentration of 8 pM; 50 nucleotides of the guide strand were sequenced using a custom
primer (miR30EcoRISeq, TAGCCCCTTGAATTCCGAGGCAGTAGGCA). To provide a
sufficient baseline for detecting shRNA depletion in experimental samples, we aimed to
acquire >500 reads per shRNA in the T0 sample, which required more than twenty million
reads per sample to compensate for disparities in shRNA representation inherent to the
pooled plasmid preparation or introduced by PCR biases. With these conditions, we acquired
T0 baselines of >500 reads for 3151 (97.9%) shRNAs. Sequence processing was performed
using a customized Galaxy platform32.

Author Manuscript

Using selection criteria that required an shRNA depletion averaging greater than 4-fold after
ten population doublings and an effect greater than 4-fold in trametinib-treated cells with
respect to untreated ones, 64 shRNAs were identified. The 8 targets for which at least two
shRNAs were selectively depleted following trametinib treatment were subject to secondary
validation in cell competition assays using multiple KRAS-mutant lung cancer cell lines. 6
targets validated in the cell line in which the primary screen was performed (H23 cells) and
4 (BRAF, CRAF, ERK2, and FGFR1) across a panel of KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells, and
as such these represented the top hits of our screen.
Plasmids and recombinant proteins

Author Manuscript

All vectors were derived from the Murine Stem Cell Virus (MSCV, Clontech) retroviral
vector backbone. miR30- and mirE-based shRNAs were designed and cloned as previously
described12 and sequences are available in Supplementary Table 1. shRNAs were cloned
into the TRMPV-Neo (pSIN-TREdsRed-miR30-PGK-Venus-IRES-NeoR), LT3GEPIR
(TRE3G-GFP-miRE-PGK-PuroR-IRES-rtTA3), and MLP (LTR-miR30-PGK-PuroR-IRESGFP) vectors as previously described12. All constructs were verified by sequencing.
Recombinant proteins FGF2 (8910, Cell Signaling), HGF (100-39, Peprotech), EGF
(AF-100-15, Peprotech), and NRG1 (100-03, Peprotech) were used at 50 ngml−1 for 10
minutes.

dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to yield 5 or 10 mM stock solutions and stored at −80 °C.

Author Manuscript

For shRNA experiments, when necessary, human cancer cells were modified to express the
ecotropic receptor and rtTA3 by retroviral transduction of MSCV-RIEP (MSCV-rtTA3IRES-EcoR-PGK-Puro) followed by drug selection (1 µgml−1 puromycin for 1 week). Cell
lines were transduced with ecotropically packaged TRMPV-Neo-shRNA retroviruses or,
alternatively, with amphotropically packaged LT3GEPIR-Puro-shRNA lentiviruses, selected
with 1mgml−1 G418 or 1 µgml−1 puromycin for 1 week, and treated with 1 µgml−1
doxycycline to induce shRNA expression.
For competitive proliferation assays shRNA-transduced cells were mixed with nontransduced cells (8:2) and cultured with doxycycline in the presence or absence of trametinib
(25 nM). The relative percentage of Venus+/dsRed+ or GFP+ cells was determined before
(T0 – blue bars) and after ten population doublings (Tf) (results are relative to T0) (Tf on
dox – grey bars / Tf on dox + trametinib – red bars). The quantification of fluorescent cells
was monitored on a Guava Easycyte (Millipore). Experiments were performed
independently two or three times.
Lentiviral production

Author Manuscript

Lentiviruses were produced by co-transfection of 293T cells with lentiviral-Cre backbone
construct and packaging and envelope vectors (psPAX2 and VSV-G), using the calcium
phosphate method. Supernatant was collected 48, 60 and 72 h post-transfection,
concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 24,000 r.p.m. for 120 min and resuspended in an
appropriate volume of HBSS solution (Gibco).
Clonogenic and apoptosis assay

Author Manuscript

For clonogenic assays, cells were seeded in triplicate into 6-well plates (5–10 × 103 cells per
well) and allowed to adhere overnight in regular growth media. Cells were then cultured in
the absence or presence of drug as indicated in complete media for 10–14 days. Growth
media with or without drug was replaced every 2 days. Remaining cells were fixed with
methanol (1%) and formaldehyde (1%), stained with 0.5% crystal violet, and photographed
using a digital scanner. Relative growth was quantified by densitometry after extracting
crystal violet from the stained cells using 10% of acetic acid. All experiments were
performed at least three times. Representative experiments are shown.
For apoptosis assays, around 1 × 106 cells were seeded into 10-cm plates and cultured in the
presence or absence of drugs as indicated. After 6 days, apoptosis and cell death were
determined using AnnexinV-APC apoptosis detection kit according to the manufacturer’s
instruction (Affymetrix eBioscience). Data were acquired using a FACS Calibur (BD
Biosciences). All experiments were performed independently three times.

Quantitative analysis of drug synergy and determination of fold change in sensitivity to
trametinib
Drug synergism was analyzed using CompuSyn software (Version 1.0) (http://
www.combosyn.com), which is based on the Median-Effect Principle (Chou) and the
Combination Index-Isobologram Theorem (Chou-Talalay)33. CompuSyn software generates
combination index (CI) values, where CI <1 indicates synergism; CI = 0.75–1.25 indicates
additive effects; and CI >1 indicates antagonism. Following the instruction of the software,
drug combinations at non-constant ratios were used to calculate Combination Index (CI) in
our study.
For calculating the fold change in sensitivity to trametinib, the GI50 for trametinib was
determined for a panel of KRAS wild type and mutant cancer cell lines in the absence or
presence of ponatinib and AZD4547. Experiments were performed independently two times.

Total RNA was isolated using TRIZOL (Invitrogen), and cDNA was obtained using the
TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR was carried
out in triplicate in three independent experiments using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems) on the ViiA™ 7 Real-Time PCR System (Invitrogen). GAPDH or βactin served as endogenous normalization controls.
Animal studies
All mouse experiments were approved by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
(MSKCC) Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol no. 12-04-006). Mice were

maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions, and food and water were provided ad
libitum. 5–7-week-old, female athymic NCR-NU-NU (Harlan laboratories) mice were used
for animal experiments with human cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. For A549,
H23, and H2122 xenografts, cells (10 × 106) were harvested on the day of use and injected
in growth-factor-reduced Matrigel/PBS (50% final concentration). One flank was injected
subcutaneously per mouse. For JHU-LX55a patient-derived xenograft, a poorly
differentiated lung adenocarcinoma bearing a KRASG12C mutation, tumors were cut into
pieces and inserted into a pocket in the subcutaneous space as previously described34. After
inoculation, mice were monitored daily, weighed twice weekly, and caliper measurements
begun when tumors became visible. Tumor volume was calculated using the following
formula: tumor volume=(D × d2)/2, in which D and d refer to the long and short tumor
diameter, respectively. When tumors reached a size of 150–300 mm3, mice were randomized
into 5–8 per group and treated with vehicle, trametinib and/or ponatinib per os for 4
consecutive days followed by 3 days off treatment, at 3 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, respectively.
No obvious toxicities were observed in the vehicle- or drug-treated animals as assessed by
difference in body weight between vehicle- and drug-treated mice taking tumor size into
account. For immunohistochemistry analysis of JHU-LX55a patient-derived xenograft
tumors, tumors were harvested 4 hours after dosing on day 18.

For drug efficacy studies using a genetically engineered mouse model of lung cancer,
KrasLSL-G12D/+ and Trp53fl/fl mice (8–12 weeks old) were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal
injection of ketamine (80 mg per kg) and xylazine (10 mg per kg) and infected
intratracheally with 2.5 × 105 infectious particles of Lenti-Cre per mouse, as previously
described35. Mice were evaluated by µCT imagingto quantify lung tumor burden before
being assigned to various treatment study cohorts. Mice were treated with vehicle,
trametinib and/or ponatinib per os for 4 consecutive days followed by 3 days off treatment,
at 3 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, respectively. µCT imaging evaluation was repeated every week
during the treatment. Investigators were not blind with respect to treatment.

For drug efficacy studies using an organoid-derived murine model of pancreatic cancer,
spherical, duct like organoids were derived and cultured in matrigel and defined media as
previously described36 from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) occurring in
KrasLSL-G12D/+; Trp53fl/+; CHC (Untargeted collagen homing cassette); RIK (Rosa26-LSLrtTa3-IRES-Kate2); p48Cre mice (GEMM-KPCflox/+) generated via the PDAC-GEMM-ESC
approach37. After initially establishing primary organoid cultures, Kate positive cells were
sorted and expanded to minimize injection of non-recombined, normal duct cells. For the
orthotopic transplantation of PDAC organoids, mice were anesthetized using Isoflurane, and
the pancreas was externalized through a small incision made in the left abdominal side near
the spleen. Organoids (approximately 250000–500000 cells per mouse) were removed from
matrigel and separated into single cells by trypsinization, washed, and finally resuspended in
25 µl of Matrigel (Matrigel, BD) diluted 1:1 with cold PBS. The organoid suspension was
injected into the tail region of the pancreas using 28 gauge surgical syringes (Hamilton).
Successful injection was verified by the appearance of a fluid bubble without signs of
intraperitoneal leakage. The abdominal wall was sutured with absorbable Vicryl suture
(Ethicon), and the skin was closed with wound clips (CellPoint Scientific Inc.). Mice were
evaluated by ultrasound(Vevo 2100, VisualSonics)to quantify pancreas tumor burden before

being randomized to various treatment study cohorts. All the treatment mice had similar
initial tumor burden. Mice were treated as described above for drug efficacy studies using a
genetically engineered model of lung cancer. Investigators were not blind with respect to
treatment.
µCT imaging
µCT Scans were performed on the Mediso Nano SPECT/CT System covering only the lung
fields of each mouse. Each scan averaged approximately 6 min using 240 projections with
an exposure time of 1,000 ms set at a pitch of 1 degree. The tube energy of the X-ray was 55
kVp and 145 µA. The in-plane voxel sizes chosen were small and thin creating a voxel size
of 73 × 73 × 73 µm. The final reconstructed image consisted of 368 × 368 × 1,897 voxels.
Scans were analysed with the Osirix software.

Immunohistochemistry

Patients with KRAS mutation-positive advanced lung adenocarcinomas were enrolled in the
phase I/II clinical study of trametinib and navitoclax (NCT02079740) and the response was
assessed per RECIST (response evaluation criteria in solid tumors) criteria. Biopsies were
obtained before treatment, and within 2–4 weeks after starting the treatment with trametinib.
Specifically, for patient #1, the post-treatment biopsy was obtained after treatment with
navitoclax for 7 days, followed by co-treatment with navitoclax and trametinib for 16 days.
The post-treatment biopsy from patient #2 was obtained after co-treatment with navitoclax
and trametinib for 22 days. All human studies were approved by the Massachusetts General
Hospital Institutional Review Board, and informed consent to study was obtained as per
protocol from all patients.

Tissues were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5
µm thick sections. Sections were subject to hematoxylin and eosin staining, and
immunohistochemical staining following standard protocols. The following primary
antibodies were used: pERKT202/Y204 (4370) and pAKTS473 (4060) (Cell signaling), and
pFRS2Y436 (ab193363) (Abcam).
Statistical Analysis

Author Manuscript

Data are expressed as mean ± s.e.m or mean ± s.d. Group size was determined based on the
results of preliminary experiments and no statistical method was used to predetermine
sample size. The indicated sample size (n) represents biological replicates. Group allocation
and outcome assessment were not performed in a blinded manner. All samples that met
proper experimental conditions were included in the analysis. Survival was measured using
the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical significance was determined using Student’s t-test, logrank test, and pearson’s correlation using Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software).
Significance was set at P<0.05.
