Abstract
The safety and efficacy of S-1 plus cisplatin in Chinese advanced gastric cancer
patients in first line setting is unknown. In this pilot study, patients with advanced
gastric or gastro-esophageal junction adenocarcinoma were enrolled and randomly
assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive S-1 plus cisplatin (CS group) or 5-FU plus cisplatin
(CF group). The primary endpoint was time to progression (TTP). Secondary end points
included overall survival (OS) and safety. This study was registered on ClinicalTrials.
Gov, number NCT01198392. A total of 236 patients were enrolled. Median TTP was
5.51 months in CS group compared with 4.62 months in CF group [hazard ratio (HR)
1.028, 95% confidential interval (CI) 0.758-1.394, p = 0.859]. Median OS was 10.00
months and 10.46 months in CS and CF groups (HR 1.046, 95%CI 0.709-1.543, p =
0.820), respectively. The most common adverse events in both groups were anemia,
leukopenia, neutropenia, nausea, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, anorexia and diarrhea.
We find that S-1 plus cisplatin is an effective and tolerable option for advanced gastric
or gastro-esophageal junction adenocarcinoma patients in China.

INTRODUCTION

approval of S-1 in USA.
For any new agent, confirmation that efficacy and
toxicity profiles are similar in non-Chinese and Chinese
patients is important, given evidence of differences in
treatment effects between populations with some agents
(e.g. the gefitinib, which has a different toxicity profile in
Asian and Western populations [18]).
Besides, Jin M et al. used S-1 monotherapy as
second-line chemotherapy in AGC patients who had
previously treated with cisplatin/ infusional fluorouracil
and they found that S-1 monotherapy provided mild
response rate and overall survival (OS) as well as
favorable toxicity profile in the second-line setting for
AGC patients [19].
In this study, we compared the effect of CS and CF
in the first-line treatment for Chinese AGC patients, using
the domestic agent of S-1 (produced by Shenzhen Wanle
Pharmacy Company). This study was designed in 2008,
before the publication of FLAGS study.

The incidence rate of gastric carcinoma varies
dramatically worldwide and it is particularly high in
Eastern Asia, especially in China [1]. Advanced gastric
cancer (AGC) patients account for 40% of new Chinese
gastric cancer patients and have a worse prognosis than
that with early stage diseases [2]. Though first-line
chemotherapy for AGC patients prolongs overall survival
(OS) and improves quality of life (QoL) compared with
best supportive care (BSC); the median survival for
AGC patients who receive palliative chemotherapy is
approximately 7 to 11 months [2-8].
The available cytotoxic agents for treatment of
AGC patients included cisplatin, fluorouracil, oxaliplatin,
irinotecan and taxane [3, 9-12]. S-1 is one of the oral
fluoropyrimidines, consisting of tegafur, 5-chloro-2,
4-dihydropyrimidine, and potassium oxonate [13, 14].
Data from two phase II studies of single agent S-1 showed
a response rate of 45% and 2-year survival of 17%, in
association with 5% or lower frequencies of grade 3 or 4
toxic effects [15, 16].
Ajani JA et al. compared cisplatin/S-1 (CS) and
cisplatin/5-fluorouracil (CF) in the first-line chemotherapy
of AGC in a non-inferiority setting (FLAGS) and they
found that CS was non-inferior to CF with a lesser toxicity
profile [17]. However, the ‘lesser toxicity’ observed in this
trial was arguable, as a lower dose of cisplatin was used in
CS group, and actually this trial failed to gain regulatory

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Between October 2008 and June 2011, 255 patients
were randomly assigned to either CS or CF group at 15
centers in China. The observation profile was listed in

SD: Standard deviation; GE: Gastroesophageal; PS: Performance status
Of the 255 patients, 236 was allocated to receive
at least one cycle of CS (n = 120) or CF (n = 116). Table
1 showed demographics and baseline characteristics of
patients included in the analysis. The basic features were
well balance between these two groups. About 50% of the
patients had low differentiated cancer. Approximately 85%
of the patients had more than one site of metastasis and
over half of the patients received previous gastrectomy.

Figure 2. There was no difference of median TTP among
the three stratification factors (Table 2). The response rate
was 22.5% [27 patients got a partial response (PR)] in CS
group and 21.6% in CF group [2 complete response (CR)
and 23 PR], p = 0.86. The OS between these two groups
was showed in Figure 3. The median OS for patients in CS
and CF group was 10.00 months(95% CI: 8.59-14.52)and
10.46 months (95% CI: 8.92-13.84), p = 0.82.

Efficacy

Safety

The mean dose intensity of S-1 and Fluorouracil was
278.46 mg/m2/week and 964.48mg/m2/week respectively.
The median cycles and duration of treatment in these
two groups were 3.53 and 3.46 (p = 0.78), 4.03 and 2.87
months (p = 0.0002), respectively.
Median time to progression (TTP) in CS and CF
groups was 5.51 months [95% confidence interval (CI):
4.59-6.26] versus 4.62 months (95% CI: 4.00-6.33),
hazard ratio (HR) 1.028, 95% CI 0.76-1.39, p = 0.86,

No significant difference in the overall rate of
adverse events between these two groups was detected
(all grades, Table 3). Anemia, neutropenia, nausea,
thrombocytopenia, vomiting and anorexia were the most
frequently reported adverse events. Patients assigned to
CS group had slightly higher rates of thrombocytopenia,
abdominal pain, hyperbilirubinemia, pigmentation and
stomatitis than did patients assigned to CF group.
Patients in CS group had higher incidence rate of

grade 3 or 4 adverse events (Table 3). Serious adverse
events (grade 3 or 4 adverse events) were reported in
73 (60%) patients in CS group and 47 (36%) patients in
CF group, p = 0.0015. The most common grade 3 or 4
adverse events were neutropenia, anemia, leucopenia and
thrombocytopenia in CF-treated patients.
The proportion of patients reporting an adverse
event that led to dose modifications or interruptions did
not differ between these two groups. No drug related death
in both groups was reported in our study.

two weeks on one week off, four weeks on two weeks
off and three weeks on two weeks off [5, 13, 15-17, 2325]. There was no study to compare the difference among
these different dose schedules in efficacy and safety. It is
reasonable to assume that longer off time would produce
less side effect and that is why we pick up the dose
schedule of 3 weeks on and two weeks off. We confirmed
that this dose schedule was tolerable in Chinese AGC
patients.
Oxaliplatin which has potentially improved
efficacy and tolerance for platinum-based chemotherapy
in AGC patients, has been widely used in the treatment
of advanced gastric cancer [4, 8, 26]. However, cisplatin
combined with fluorouracil was considered as the standard
treatment for control group, the aim of our study was to
make a direct comparison between S-1 and fluorouracil,
so we chose cisplatin in both groups while not oxaliplatin.
In conclusion, we found that S-1 plus cisplatin
was comparable to fluorouracil plus cisplatin, with a
similar TTP and tolerable toxicity. In China, central
venous catheterization or peripherally inserted central
catheterization (PICC) would be established for patients
to receive continuous infusion of 5Fu, but unnecessary
for administration of cisplatin. With the advantage of
oral administration, patients in S-1 group avoided the
venous port. Based on our finding, S-1 plus cisplatin, was
an acceptable substitute for infusion 5-FU plus cisplatin
and an appropriate option as first-line chemotherapy for
advanced gastric cancer patients in China. This pilot study
provides some basic information for the further phase III
clinical study for S1 in China.

DISCUSSION
Our findings showed that CS had comparable
treatment effect with CF, with respect to similar results of
TTP, RR and OS. Patients assigned to S-1 had a 0.9 month
longer TTP than those allocated to a continuous infusion
of fluorouracil. These findings for S-1 were consistent with
the previous reports [5, 15]. Drug development for gastric
cancer has been focused on replacement of intravenous
fluorouracil with oral agents [4, 20]. Taken together
with our findings, S-1 can be an alternative option for
continuous infusion of fluorouracil in China.
Toxic effects of S-1 have been reported to be more
severe in individuals from USA than those from Asian,
indicating different dosage recommended for these
populations [13, 21]. Since similar discrepancies in toxic
effects have been noted with tegafur and uracil, ethnic
variations seem to be a factor with these dihydropyrimidine
dehydrogenase inhibitory fluoropyrimidines [22]. In
2008, an American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)
abstract showed that S-1 plus cisplatin was superior to
continuous infusion of fluorouracil plus cisplatin. Outside
Asia, despite differences in dose and schedule of S-1 from
Asian trials, S-1 plus cisplatin was associated with fewer
toxic effects, slightly better survival, and non-inferiority
compared with fluorouracil plus cisplatin [5]. In our study,
no significant difference in the overall rate of adverse
events between CS and CF groups was found. Despite a
higher rate of grade 3 or 4 adverse events in CS group
than in CF group, the number of patients discontinuing
treatment due to toxicity was limited, and patients in CS
group were able to stay on treatment longer than those in
CF group. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events
was hemorrhage. Early and effective prophylaxis as well
as management of adverse events were helpful to ensure
that patients would remain on the treatment.
The two treatment regimens were different in
terms of cycle length: 5 weeks in CS group and 4 weeks
in CF group. It seemed that the treatment duration was
biased from the beginning favoring the experimental
arm. However, patients in these two groups received the
scans with the same frequency, every 8 weeks. This could
eliminate the potential bias from different cycle lengths.
There were different dose schedules for S1, including
one week on one week off, two weeks on two weeks off,

or clinically if a patient could not have radiological
examination. Patients were followed up until death, loss
to follow-up or end of study. Efficacy and safety data were
monitored by an independent data monitoring committee.
Adverse events were assessed according to the National
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 3.0 and serious
adverse events according to International Conference on
Harmonization guidelines.

Treatment assessments

Ethics statement

CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvic were
performed for tumor assessment 2 weeks before and
repeated repeated every 8 weeks during the treatment.
After the treatment, patients were recommended to receive
the CT scans every 3 months. All patients in this study had
full information of follow-up. The last date of follow-up
was June 1st, 2014.

All patients provided written informed consent.
Approvals for the study protocol (and any modifications
thereof) were obtained from independent ethics
committees. The study was undertaken in accordance with
the ethical standards of the World Medical Association
Declaration of Helsinki. This study was registered on
ClinicalTrials. Gov, number NCT01198392.

Statistical analysis

Treatments

The intention-to-treat (ITT) principle was applied.
All statistical analysis was performed by Statistical
Package of Social Sciences 16.0 software. TTP was
adjusted for stratification factors. Patient characteristics
were described using summary statistics. P value for
comparing patient characteristics was calculated using
chi squared test. Statistical significance was set at twosided P < 0.05. All efficacy analysis were done on the
full population. No imputation was made for missing
assessments. Safety analysis included patients who
received at least one dose of study medication.

Patients who satisfied all eligibility criteria were
randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive S1 (Shenzhen
Wanle Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. China) plus cisplatin (CS
group) or fluorouracil plus cisplatin (CF group). As a pilot
study, there is no need for sample size calculation. We
planned to enroll 270 patients.
Randomized
grouping
information
for each patient was generated by central
randomization  system. At randomization, patients were
stratified by ECOG PS (0-1 vs. 2), numbers of metastasis
sites (1 vs. > 1) and gastrectomy (yes vs no). Neither
patients nor investigators were masked to treatment
assignment in this open-label study.
S-1 was given as 40mg/m2 twice daily on day 1-21
and cisplatin was 20mg/m2 ivdrip on day 1-4, repeated
every 5 weeks in the CS group. In the CF group, 5-Fu was
given as 800 mg/m2/d CI 120h, and the dosage of cisplatin
was 20mg/m2 iv on day 1-4, repeated every 4 weeks.
The treatment would continue until disease progression,
unacceptable toxicity, and withdrawal of consent or 6
cycles. Infusion treatment would be administrated in the
inpatient department. Chemotherapy dose adjustments
were allowed. Crossover to the other group at the time of
disease progression was not allowed.
The primary endpoint was time to progression
(TTP), defined as time from randomization until disease
progression (PD) or death from any cause. Secondary
endpoint included overall survival (OS) and safety.
Investigators assessed tumor response and progression
every 8  weeks, either radiologically using Response
