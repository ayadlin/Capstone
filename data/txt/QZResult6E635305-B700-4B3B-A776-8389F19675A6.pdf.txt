BACKGROUND: Sorafenib and sunitinib are oral vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
approved in 2005 and 2006, respectively, for the treatment of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). A population-based, observational cohort study of the cardiovascular risk of VEGFR TKI therapy in elderly RCC patients was conducted. METHODS: Using the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results–Medicare database, this study analyzed patients who were 66 years old or older and
were diagnosed with RCC from 2000 to 2009. The incidence of cardiovascular adverse events, including congestive heart failure and
cardiomyopathy (CHF/CM), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke, and cardiovascular deaths, was examined through December
2010. A Cox proportional hazards model was created to calculate the hazard ratio (HR), and adjustments were made for age, sex,
comorbidity, and the use of other systemic therapy. RESULTS: A total of 171 of 670 patients who received sunitinib or sorafenib had
cardiovascular events. The incidence rates for CHF/CM, AMI, and stroke were 0.87, 0.14, and 0.14 per 1000 person-days, respectively.
Sunitinib or sorafenib use was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events (HR, 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.021.87) and especially stroke (HR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.52-5.31) in comparison with 788 patients diagnosed with advanced RCC from 2007 to
2009 who were eligible for Part D but did not receive either agent. In subgroup analyses, patients who were 66 to 74 years old at diagnosis had the highest increased risk of stroke associated with the use of either or both drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Sunitinib and sorafeC 2015
nib might be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and particularly stroke. Cancer 2016;122:124-30. V

INTRODUCTION
There are 63,000 new cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) diagnosed annually in the United States, and 16% are diagnosed with metastatic disease.1 The 5-year survival rate for patients with metastatic RCC is only 12%.1 A growing understanding of the biology of RCC has led to US Food and Drug Administration approval of several agents targeting the
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase. Sorafenib and sunitinib, the earliest VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), received US Food and Drug Administration approval in December 2005 and January 2006,
respectively.2 These agents inhibit VEGFR-driven tumor angiogenesis and lead to the rapid onset of tumor cell hypoxia
and death. Sorafenib significantly improved median progression-free survival from 2.8 (with a placebo) to 5.5 months for
patients with cytokine-refractory RCC.3 Sunitinib showed an improvement in median progression-free survival from
5 (with interferon-a) to 11 months.4
However, despite the improvements in survival, there are concerns about possibly significant cardiovascular complications associated with VEGFR TKIs.3,4 In meta-analyses of clinical trials, there was an increased risk of congestive
heart failure (CHF) associated with sunitinib (relative risk, 1.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-2.50; P < .01) and
a significantly increased risk of arterial thromboembolic events from both sunitinib and sorafenib (relative risk, 3.03; 95%

CI, 1.25-7.37; P 5 .15).5,6 However, these trials do not
generalize well to US community oncology practice
because of the lower median age of trial participants
(mid-50s) in comparison with most patients (median age,
64 years) and because of the use of eligibility criteria that
exclude those with significant cardiac-related comorbidities.1,5,6 Therefore, we conducted a population-based,
observational cohort study of patients who were 66 years
old or older to estimate the incidence and relative risk of
cardiovascular complications from the use of either sunitinib or sorafenib among patients with advanced RCC seen
in a community oncology practice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source and Study Population

We used a database consisting of cancer registry information from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registries
linked with Medicare claims data, which cover approximately 26% of the US elderly population.7 All data were
de-identified so that no protected health information
could be linked to individual patients. The institutional
review board from the MedStar Georgetown Cancer Network exempted this study.
We selected patients who were diagnosed with primary RCC between January 2000 and December 2009,
were at least 66 year old at diagnosis, and were confirmed
by registry reporting sources other than an autopsy or death
certificate (n 5 51,781). We restricted the sample to those
who were enrolled in both Medicare Part A and Medicare
Part B (but not in a health maintenance organization) from
Cancer

1 year before the diagnosis to the end of follow-up, which
for this cohort was December 31, 2010 (n 5 31,824).
Use of Systemic Therapy

The use of sunitinib and sorafenib was identified from Part
D claims with National Drug Code codes. The ending date
for sunitinib and sorafenib use was defined as the last claim
date plus the number of days of supply. The use of other
chemotherapy drugs was identified from both Part D (oral)
and Part B (intravenous) claims (Table 1 shows specific
agents and corresponding National Drug Code and
Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes).
The date of the last dose of other chemotherapy was
defined as the later date when we compared the last Part B
claim date and the last Part D claim date plus the number
of days of supply.
Definition of Sorafenib and Sunitinib Use

Sorafenib and sunitinib users included all patients with
RCC who received sorafenib, sunitinib, or both drugs at
any time after the initial diagnosis because RCC patients
who received VEGFR TKIs for advanced disease could
potentially have been diagnosed previously at an earlier disease stage. Ten to thirty-five percent of RCC patients diagnosed with nonmetastatic disease experience metastatic
progression or recurrences that can be treated with these
therapies.1 Our comparison group consisted of patients
with RCC who never received sunitinib or sorafenib for
primary metastatic RCC in 2007-2009. We adopted this
approach, rather than including patients diagnosed at earlier stages of RCC, because it was not feasible to accurately
identify such patients who later had advanced disease (but

were not treated) from SEER-Medicare data. We compared the characteristics and survival of primary metastatic
cases and recurrent cases who received VEGFR TKIs to
assess any potential survival bias arising from using only
primary metastatic patients in our comparison group.
Outcome of Interest

We examined cardiovascular adverse events, including congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy (CHF/CM), acute
myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke, and cardiovascularrelated deaths (see the International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision codes used in Table 2). A patient was classified as having a condition if its diagnosis was present 1) in
an inpatient claim as a primary diagnosis, 2) in an inpatient
claim as a secondary diagnosis plus at least 1 outpatient
claim, or 3) in 2 separate outpatient claims at least 30 days
apart. Requiring more than 1 claim for an outpatient or secondary inpatient diagnosis balanced the sensitivity and specificity of CHF/CM ascertainment.8 Cardiovascular-related
deaths were identified via International Classification of
Diseases, Tenth Revision cause-of-death codes starting
with “I.”
Other Variables

Information on patients’ basic demographic characteristics was obtained from the SEER data. The stage of RCC
was characterized with the American Joint Committee on
Cancer definitions, but this information was not available
for RCC cases in SEER before 2005. Comorbidity was
assessed with a modified Charlson index and was assigned
to 1 of 3 categories: 0, 1, or  2.9
Data Analyses

Distributions of baseline characteristics were calculated
separately for different subgroups of users of VEGFR TKI
therapies. We calculated the incidence rates of cardiovascular events per 1000 person-days between the initiation
of the drug and 60 days after the last dose for each of the
subgroups. To assess the effect of sunitinib and sorafenib
on cardiovascular incidents, we used Cox proportional
hazards regression models to separately compare each of
126

the 4 groups of cases with our comparison group, with
adjustments made for the use of other systemic therapy,
age at diagnosis, baseline comorbidity, and sex. For each
case group, we used separate Cox proportional hazards
models to assess the risks of each of the cardiovascular
events. All subjects were followed to the end of the study,
death, or the occurrence of a cardiovascular event, whichever occurred first, with the start time (time zero) being
the date of diagnosis of RCC. Patients from the comparison group were censored at the end of follow-up or death
from noncardiovascular causes, and cases receiving
VEGFR TKIs were censored 60 days after the final dose
of the drug. To control for the various start dates of therapy, both sunitinib/sorafenib and other systemic therapy
were coded as time-dependent variables, with exposure
starting with the first claim date of the drug and ending
on the 61st day after the last dose. We ascertained the
validity of the proportionality assumption with interaction terms with the logarithm of time (all interactions,
P > .05). We conducted a sensitivity analysis without
stopping exposure to the TKI therapies 60 days after the
last dose to assess the potential for risks attributable to
exposures lasting longer than 60 days. To determine the
subpopulations at the greatest increased risk of adverse
events among sunitinib or sorafenib users, we performed a
subgroup analysis by age (66-74 and 75 years) and
comorbidity (Charlson index: 0, 1, or higher). We conducted all tests as 2-sided tests and used a significance level
of .05. All calculations were performed with SAS 9.4
(SAS, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
We identified 670 patients who received either sunitinib or
sorafenib (Table 3). There were 111 patients who received
both sunitinib and sorafenib in sequential administration,
and 396 and 163 patients received only sunitinib or sorafenib, respectively. One-third of the patients were 75 years
old or older, and more than half had 1 or more comorbid
conditions. Approximately half were diagnosed with
advanced (stage IV) disease. Forty-eight percent of the
patients received at least 1 other systemic therapy, including
bevacizumab (30.9%) and pazopanib (3.4%), in addition
to sunitinib or sorafenib over the course of their disease.
There were 171 total cardiovascular events among
patients who received the 2 VEGFR TKIs, and this translated into an overall incidence rate of 1.02 (95% CI,
0.88-1.19) per 1000 person-days (Table 4). The overall
incidence rate was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.37-0.80) for those
patients who received both sunitinib and sorafenib; this
was lower than the rates for the 2 groups who received

AMI, and stroke in those who received 1 of the 2 drugs
were 0.87, 0.14, and 0.14 per 1000 person-days,
respectively.
Table 5 shows both unadjusted and adjusted hazard
ratios (HRs) for each of the cardiovascular events among
the 670 recipients of the 2 VEGFR TKI therapies versus
the 788 comparison patients not receiving TKIs. After
adjustments for the age at diagnosis, sex, comorbidity,
and use of other systemic therapy, the risk of any cardiovascular events among those who received sunitinib or
sorafenib was higher than the risk for the comparison
group (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.02-1.87). The risk of stroke
was significantly elevated among those receiving sunitinib
or sorafenib (HR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.52-5.31) and among

and sunitinib-only patients (HR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.005.22). The risk of CHF/CM was increased in sunitinibonly patients (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.01-2.33) but not in
sorafenib-only patients. The risks of AMI among those
receiving either one of the VEGFR TKIs were slightly elevated but not statistically different from a null effect of
therapy on risk.
We then examined whether other factors contributed to the elevated risk of stroke. We found that increasing age and greater comorbidity were also significantly
associated with an increased risk of stroke among recipients of either sunitinib or sorafenib (Table 6).
In the subgroup analyses by age and comorbidity,
we found that the risk of stroke was similar in the

who were 66 to 74 years old, we found a much larger
effect (HR, 6.94; 95% CI, 2.52-19.09) in comparison
with patients who 75 years old or older (HR, 1.33; 95%

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first population-based,
observational study to evaluate the risk of cardiovascular
128

events associated with treatment with VEGFR TKIs for
advanced RCC. The most significant finding in our study
is that we observed a statistically and clinically significant
increase (nearly 3-fold) in the risk of stroke in patients
who were 66 years old or older and were receiving
VEGFR TKIs, although the absolute incidence rate of
stroke was low.
The increased risk of stroke from VEGFR TKIs in
the current study is consistent with a clinical trial metaCancer

analysis of sunitinib- or sorafenib-treated patients, which
showed an increased risk of arterial thromboembolic
events from sorafenib (3.8-fold) and sunitinib (2.4-fold).6
There was no significant difference in the risk of arterial
thromboembolic events (stroke or AMI) between sorafenib and sunitinib in the meta-analysis, and our results also
showed no difference in the risk of stroke or AMI by the
type of VEGFR TKI (P 5 .59; data not shown). However,
there was a difference in the risk of arterial thromboembolism by the type of cardiovascular event in our analysis. In
contrast to a statistically significant increased risk of
stroke, the risk of AMI was not statistically significantly
elevated. Although this null finding for AMI may partly
be due to a lack of power, it remains uncertain whether
the small yet elevated risk of arterial thromboembolism
previously reported in trials differs with the type of event
because the meta-analysis did not provide separate estimates for the risks of stroke and AMI.6
Our observation of an increased risk of arterial
thromboembolic events may be explained by several factors. First, VEGFR TKIs can disrupt the regenerative
capacity of the endothelial cells and cause vascular wall
defects; this can expose prothrombotic phospholipids on
the luminal plasma membrane and the underlying matrix
and lead to thrombosis.10 Second, sunitinib and sorafenib
are known to be associated with an increase in the risk of
hypertension, which is a well-known risk factor for arterial
thromboembolic events overall.11 In addition to hypertension, stroke can be a result of cardiac embolic events
triggered by drug-induced cardiac arrhythmias such as
atrial fibrillation. There was a case report of a patient who
developed atrial fibrillation on VEGFR TKIs; however,
we could not find any studies reporting or correlating the
presence of stroke with cardiac arrhythmia.12 Many elCancer

derly patients with atrial fibrillation are asymptomatic
and may present with a cardiovascular event as the first
manifestation of the arrhythmia. In our study, among 24
patients who had a stroke during sunitinib or sorafenib
administration, 4 patients also had arrhythmia during the
drug exposure.
A meta-analysis of clinical trials reported a statistically significantly increased risk of CHF with sunitinib
(1.81-fold).5 Our study also showed a fairly consistent
finding for CHF (a 1.53-fold–increased risk) after the use
of sunitinib. It has been hypothesized that inhibition of
vascular endothelial growth factor may impair myocardial
function, especially in the setting of hypertension and
pathologic pressure overload, and thus lead to heart failure; however, predictors and mechanisms leading to cardiomyopathy after exposure to VEGFR TKIs remain
uncertain pending further investigation.13
We observed that patients with RCC who received
both sunitinib and sorafenib had fewer cardiovascular
events than those who received either sunitinib or sorafenib. It is possible that patients who did not develop any
significant cardiovascular events from one VEGFR TKI
switched to the other TKI at the time of disease progression, and this suggests the possibility of a selection bias in
that recipients of both agents had a better overall health
status permitting such a switch in comparison with those
who received one or the other agent.
An increased risk of stroke from sunitinib or sorafenib was significant for the patients who were 66 to 74
years old but not for the patients who were 75 years old or
older. One possible explanation is more careful selection
of patients aged 75 years or older when physicians prescribe sunitinib or sorafenib; however, further study is
warranted to confirm this finding.

Original Article

Nephrectomy may result in de novo or accelerated
chronic renal insufficiency, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease14; however, we did not find any significant change in the HRs for cardiovascular events after the
addition of nephrectomy and chronic renal insufficiency
to the Cox proportional hazards model.
Our study has several limitations. First, our study
used Medicare claims data to define events, and such data
have a relatively low positive predictive value in identifying
CHF.15 Therefore, it is possible that our study overestimated the overall incidence of CHF. The misclassification
of CHF may make our estimates higher than the true effect.
Second, we do not know why patients in the comparison
group did not receive the drugs, although one can speculate
that it could be expense, comorbidity, or personal choice.
On the other hand, patients in the comparison group might
have received sunitinib or sorafenib via supplemental insurance policies (rather than Part D), and this could have led
to differential ascertainment of TKI use. However, this is
likely to have resulted in an underestimation of HRs for
cardiovascular events, and thus our estimates likely reflect
the lower bound estimates of the true risk. Finally, we
included patients receiving TKIs who either had stage IV
RCC at the initial diagnosis or progressed to an advanced
state after the diagnosis of earlier stages of RCC, whereas
the comparison group included only patients who had stage
IV RCC at diagnosis because of the difficulty in measuring
recurrences or disease progression in claims data. The inclusion of recurrent patients in the TKI group but not in the
control group may have introduced a survival bias into our
study. However, when we compared TKI patients
diagnosed with stage IV RCC with patients with earlier
stages who progressed to advanced RCC, we found that the
2 groups had similar cardiovascular event rates as well as
survival, and this suggested that the survival bias may not
have significantly affected the results.
In conclusion, our study suggests that VEGFR TKIs
are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular
events and stroke in particular, although the absolute risk
is very low. Clinicians should be aware of this adverse
effect to prevent or detect its development, provide early
interventions, and balance the therapeutic benefit with
adverse events.
