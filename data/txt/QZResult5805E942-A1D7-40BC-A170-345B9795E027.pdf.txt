BACKGROUND: Although treatment for multiple myeloma (MM) has considerably improved in the past decade,
MM continues to be an incurable hematological malignancy that causes most patients to eventually relapse and
die from their illness. Thus, the identification of effective salvage strategies remains a priority. METHODS: In this
trial, the authors evaluated the safety and efficacy of bortezomib and dexamethasone [V: on days 1 and 15 (1.3 mg/
mq); D: on days 1-2 and 15-16, every 28-day cycle until progression (20 mg/d)] as maintenance therapy (MT) in
patients with advanced MM who responded to salvage therapy that used a bortezomib-containing regimen.
RESULTS: Forty-nine MM patients were enrolled in this study between October of 2004 and April of 2008. All
patients who were included in this study were responsive to a prior salvage therapy with bortezomib and had a
measurable disease. The bortezomib and dexamethasone MT improved the quality of responses to complete remission in 4 patients and very good partial response in 3 patients. In addition, 10 patients experienced at least a 50%
improvement in their symptoms. The median time to progression (TTP) was 16 months with a progression-free survival of 61% after 1 year. The overall response after 1 year was 76%, and the cumulative incidence of death due to disease progression, which was adjusted for competitive risk events, was 14%. Non-dose-limiting toxicities included
neuropathy (predominantly grade 1), herpes zoster reactivation, pneumonia, and gastrointestinal affections (constipation and diarrhea). Three patients developed grade 2 neuropathy, which required a bortezomib dose reduction to 1.0
mg/mq. No grade 3 or 4 toxicities were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: The use of bortezomib and dexamethasone as MT
in advanced MM was effective and well tolerated. The twice-monthly bortezomib infusion appeared to reduce the
incidence of grade 3 and 4 neuropathies in comparison to similar experiences in other settings. Cancer 2011;117:1884–

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell proliferation disorder that causes approximately 17,000 deaths
each year in Europe.1 The survival of MM patients has improved considerably in the past decade because of melphalanbased high-dose therapy2,3 and the emerging role of novel therapies, including thalidomide, bortezomib, and lenalidomide.4-7 Unfortunately, MM remains an incurable disease, and almost all patients will eventually relapse and die from
their illness. Indeed, the median survival time of MM is approximately 4 to 5 years (2 years after relapse).8 Thus, the
identification of effective salvage strategies to control or delay disease progression remains a priority.

VD as Maintenance Therapy in Advanced MM/Benevolo et al

Corticosteroid maintenance has been shown to prolong the duration of response, although the effect on survival has been controversial.9,10 Interferon-alpha has been
demonstrated to cause frequent side effects and has only
demonstrated a modest increase in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).11
Thalidomide has also been considered for MM maintenance. Compared with no treatment or pamidronate
treatment alone, OS for patients who were randomized to
receive thalidomide maintenance therapy improved as demonstrated in a French trial.12 In addition, Barlogie et al13
studied post–autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT)
patients and reported a trend toward an increase in OS
using thalidomide treatment at 72-month follow-up. In a
similar experimental setup, Spencer et al14 demonstrated an
OS rate of 86% for a thalidomide-treatment group compared with 75% for a control group. Despite the findings
from 3 separate phase III studies that thalidomide maintenance improves OS, thalidomide has not been widely used
because of concerns about its toxicity, which appears to be
both dose dependent and cumulative.15
Lenalidomide may offer the same advantages as thalidomide but without the same degree of toxicity, and
large randomized trials are now addressing its role after
melphalan in the post-transplantation setting16 and in the
management of elderly patients.17
Bortezomib was the first proteasome inhibitor to
enter the clinic and be approved for the treatment of
MM.7,18 Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of
bortezomib as a front-line therapy in advanced MM.7,19
A trial involving patients with newly diagnosed MM, the
HOVON-65/GMMG-HD4 phase III clinical trial, has
compared a bortezomib-containing regimen (PAD-B)
given during induction before ASCT and in the subsequent maintenance phase with an anthracyclin-containing
regimen given during induction and followed by maintenance with thalidomide (VAD-T).20 Preliminary data
demonstrated bortezomib to be superior, which had an
overall complete response rate, including maintenance, of
27% versus 5% for the VAD-T arm. Chromosome abnormalities, such as the deletion of chromosome 13, did not
affect the efficacy of bortezomib. Peripheral neuropathy
and constitutional symptoms were the major adverse
effects of this treatment.
Another clinical trial is currently ongoing in newly
diagnosed MM patients who are not candidates for
ASCT. This trial is comparing induction treatment with
bortezomib plus melphalan, thalidomide, and prednisone
(VMPT) with bortezomib plus MP (VMP). After induc-

tion, only the VMPT arm has been scheduled to receive a
maintenance treatment of bortezomib at a reduced dose
(1.3 mg/mq every other week) until disease recurrence or
intolerable toxicity. The results of this trial will help to
clarify the role of bortezomib in induction treatment, as
well as the benefit derived from a prolonged but reduced
dose of bortezomib in the maintenance phase of newly
diagnosed MM patients.21
The present study was the first trial to evaluate the
safety and the efficacy of bortezomib/dexamethasone
maintenance therapy in patients with relapsed and
relapsed/refractory MM who responded to salvage therapy with bortezomib-containing regimens.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Between October 2004 and April 2008, a total of 49
patients were enrolled in the study. All the patients had
relapsed after a previous chemotherapy or the disease was
refractory, which was defined by progression during treatment or within 60 days after the completion of treatment.
All patients received salvage therapy, which was at the discretion of the referring hematologist. Salvage therapy
included bortezomib as a single agent, bortezomib in
combination with steroids and/or thalidomide, and bortezomib in association with anthracyclines. Patients who
were responsive to salvage therapy that utilized a bortezomib-containing regimen were eligible for inclusion in the
study. Patients in complete remission (CR) after salvage
therapy were not eligible for inclusion in this study
because of the lack of measurable disease. In addition,
patients with disease progression were excluded for their
apparent resistance to bortezomib therapy.
To be included in this study, patients had to be at
least 18 years old, had relapsed or were refractory after
more than 1 line of treatment, had exhibited a previous
response to bortezomib therapy, had exhibited measurable
disease (defined as a monoclonal immunoglobulin concentration on serum electrophoresis of at least 5 g/L [0.5
g/dL] IgG and IgA, 2 g/L [0.2 g/dL] IgD, or urinary
excretion of at least 200 mg monoclonal light chain per
24 hours), and had a platelet count of 75  109/L or
higher.
Patients with a preexisting peripheral neuropathy or
grade 2 or patients who were refractory to bortezomib
were excluded.

Study Design
This was a multicenter, noncomparative, open-label study
investigating the combination of bortezomib and dexamethasone as maintenance therapy in patients with
advanced MM. The primary objectives of this study were
to demonstrate the efficacy of bortezomib and dexamethasone by demonstrating at least 30% of patients were in
partial remission (PR) and to determine an acceptable rate
of toxicity for grade 3 nonhematological effects and grade
4 hematological effects. The secondary objectives of this
study were to determine the durations of PFS and OS. We
received informed consent from all the patients, and the
study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki. In addition, the local ethics committee
approved this protocol.
Drug Administration
When used as a maintenance therapy, bortezomib (Janssen & Cilag; Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical
Research and Development, LLC, Raritan, NJ) was
administered by intravenous bolus on days 1 and 15 (1.3
mg/mq), and dexamethasone was given orally (20 mg/
day) on days 1-2 and 15-16 of every 28-day cycle until
relapse. The therapy started within 60 days of the end of
salvage therapy. Responsive patients continued treatment
until relapse.

Efficacy and Safety Assessments
Blood samples were collected at screening, before each
intravenous treatment, and at the end of the study. A
complete neurological evaluation was performed during
the initial screening, during treatment as needed, and at
the end of treatment.
Treatment response was monitored by measuring
serum and urine protein levels using the uniformed
response criteria of the International Myeloma Working Group to define responses.22 Briefly, a CR
required the disappearance of myeloma protein in serum and urine and negative immunofixation. A very
good partial response (VGPR) required at least a 90%
reduction in myeloma protein level in serum or urine
(myeloma protein level <100 mg/24 hours). A PR
required at least a 50% reduction in myeloma protein
level in serum and a 90% decrease in urine. Stable
disease (SD) was defined as all responses that did not
meet the criteria for CR, VGPR, PR, or progressive
disease. Progressive disease (PD) was defined as an
increase of at least 25% in myeloma protein level
from baseline. Bone marrow plasmacytosis, skeletal

%

disease, and serum calcium level were included in the
response evaluation. All adverse events were assessed
at each visit and graded according to the National
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (version 3).23 Causes of death were recorded as disease
related, drug toxicity, other causes, or a combination
of these factors.
Statistical Analysis
Progression-free survival was defined as the time from the
start of maintenance to disease progression or patient
death from any cause. A univariate analysis of factors that
affected PFS was performed via the log-rank test. The cumulative incidence of death from disease progression was
calculated from the start of maintenance therapy to death
from either disease progression or another cause. According to the method of Gooley et al,24 death from other
causes has been considered to be a competing event in
the calculation of the cumulative incidence of death from
disease progression.

RESULTS
Patients
Between October of 2004 and April of 2008, 49 advanced
MM patients who were responsive to salvage therapy with
bortezomib were included in the study and received maintenance therapy with bortezomib and dexamethasone
(VD). The patient group included 28 men and 21
women. The median age of the patients was 71 years
(IQR, 66-75 years), the median hemoglobin value was
11.3 g/dL (IQR, 10.4-18.8 g/dL), and 8 patients (16.3%)
had renal failure (creatinine >2 mg/dL; Table 1). The
median number of prior therapies was 2 (2-3). Thirtynine patients (80%) received bortezomib as a single agent
or in combination with steroids and/or thalidomide, and
10 patients (20%) received bortezomib in association
with anthracyclines. The median time from diagnosis to
the first dose of maintenance therapy was 49 months
(IQR, 26-56 months), and the median number of bortezomib infusions was 8 (7-12). All patients were able to be
analyzed for response at the date of the last follow-up.
Safety
The most common non-dose-limiting grades 1 and 2
adverse events included fatigue (8 patients), gastrointestinal symptoms (3 patients), herpes zoster reactivation (2
patients), and pneumonia (2 patients). Gastrointestinal
symptoms (constipation and diarrhea) were typically mild
to moderate and were manageable with routine support.
The 2 patients who developed herpes zoster reactivation
were not on acyclovir prophylaxis. After the introduction
of acyclovir, herpes zoster reactivation was not observed.
Fifteen patients developed grade 1 sensory neuropathy,
which resolved with gabapentin and vitamins. Three
patients developed grade 2 neuropathy, which required
the dose of bortezomib to be reduced to 1.0 mg/mq.
None of the patients exhibited grade 3 or 4 neuropathies
or hematological toxicities, and no patient needed granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support. In addition, no
deaths were reported as a consequence of adverse events.

Efficacy
After a median follow-up of 25 months (IQR, 20-28
months), 16 patients died from disease progression, 1
patient died from acute heart failure, and 6 patients died
from infections. The maintenance therapy improved the
quality of response after salvage therapy to CR in 4
patients and to VGPR in 3 patients. In addition, 10
patients achieved at least a 50% response improvement
(Table 2). The overall response rate (ORR) was 34.6%,
and the ORR ‘‘positive’’ (including SD, which counted as
a positive response) was 73.4%. The median time to progression was 17 months (95% CI, 7-38 months), with a
PFS at 1 year of 61% (95% CI, 48%-75%; Fig. 1). The
OS at 1 year was 79% (95% CI, 75%-88%), and the
cumulative incidence of death due to disease progression

1887

Original Article

(adjusted for competitive risk events) was 12% (95% CI,
2%-19%; Fig. 2). In the univariate analysis, the PFS after
maintenance therapy was not significantly affected by age,
sex, number or type of previous therapy, hemoglobin
concentration, or serum creatinine level.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety profile
of the combination of VD as maintenance therapy
in patients with advanced multiple myeloma who had
previously responded to salvage bortezomib-containing
regimens.
Several studies have suggested that the achievement
of a CR in MM patients positively affects survival,25 and
new drugs have considerably improved the OS; however,
almost all patients relapse, which has suggested the presence of residual disease. Ideally, maintenance therapy
should be effective in residual disease control by increasing the duration of remission and ultimately in a better
survival.
The use of bortezomib-containing regimens in
advanced myeloma has induced a variable response rate of
about 25% (the combination of bortezomib plus melphalan induced a CR or VGPR rate of 15%,26 the combination of bortezomib with thalidomide and dexamethasone
induced a near-CR rate of 16%,27 and a CR or VGPR
rate of at least 43% was achieved in patients who were
treated with bortezomib plus melphalan, thalidomide,
and prednisone28).
With the addition of maintenance therapy after
salvage therapy, we demonstrated an ORR of 34.6%. A
CR and VGPR were observed in 14% of patients, whereas
an overall ‘‘positive’’ response rate (including SD) was
achieved in 73.4% of patients. Interestingly, the response
rate that was induced by VD maintenance therapy was
quite similar to the response rate that was achieved by
adding bortezomib to other agents, such as melphalan and
thalidomide. Because CR and VGPR have been shown to
be predictive of remission duration and survival, we were
encouraged by the increased quality of response that
we observed after salvage therapy was coupled with VD
maintenance therapy.
In fact, we observed a median time to progression of
16 months, which was significantly higher in a subset of
advanced patients.
In agreement with the results of several studies,29,30
in our study the responsiveness to bortezomib did not
correlate with most of the standard prognostic factors.

1888

Even when bortezomib was used as maintenance therapy,
it is possible that the unique mechanism of action of
bortezomib overcame the influence of these adverse prognostic factors.
Moreover, a comparison of the efficacy of bortezomib plus dexamethasone in cases of MM relapse17,31
(ORR, 67%; including 11% CR, 22% VGPR, and 18%
PR, with a median time to progression [TTP] of 6.22
months) with the efficacy of lenalidomide plus dexamethasone (ORR 60%, including 15% of patients achieving
CR, a median OS of 35 months, and a median TTP of 11
months), which was investigated in 2 pivotal phase III
studies (MM-009 and MM-010),32,33 demonstrates that
bortezomib results in a higher incidence of ORR, including CR and VGPR, but a lower TTP. These data suggest a
decisive effect on TTP of the role of using lenalidomide as
maintenance therapy until relapse.
Interestingly, when a sequential approach including
bortezomib as an induction and lenalidomide as a postASCT consolidation-maintenance strategy was explored
in a phase II study,15 the authors observed a CR and
VGPR response rate of 58% after induction, which
became 86% during the maintenance phase. In addition,
they observed a 2-year TTP of 75% and an OS of 86%.
Moreover, the median time to response with bortezomib
was about 1 month, and PR was more rapidly achieved
than VGPR and CR. Thus, we might be able to optimize
the efficacy of bortezomib when it is used as a maintenance therapy.
These data demonstrate the significant role of maintenance therapy in MM patients and suggest the possibility of using bortezomib instead of lenalidomide or indeed
as part of a combination approach in maintenance
therapy.
In the present study, most adverse events could be
managed with the use of standard approaches. No patients
developed grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicities or grade 4
peripheral neuropathy, which was likely a result of the
twice-monthly bortezomib infusion. Grade 2 neuropathic
pain was observed in 3 patients, and they were all treated
with a high cumulative dose of bortezomib. These observations agree with the results of previous bortezomib studies,34-36 wherein the incidence of bortezomib-induced
peripheral neuropathy plateaued at a cumulative dose
of 42-45 mg/mq in relapsed and newly diagnosed
MM patients. Importantly, our findings suggest that bortezomib can subsequently be used for maintenance therapy without any further substantial increase in the risk of
peripheral neuropathy. This finding appears to contrast

Cancer

VD as Maintenance Therapy in Advanced MM/Benevolo et al

with thalidomide-associated peripheral neuropathy,
wherein the risk continues to increase as treatment time
increases.37
Despite the absence of any anticoagulant prophylaxis, no deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary
embolism (PE) was reported. These data are consistent
with previous studies, which have shown that bortezomib
in combination with dexamethasone and/or concomitant
EPO did not appear to be associated with an elevated risk
of DVT or PE.38
By administering bortezomib on a bimonthly basis,
we avoided the most common adverse effects of prolonged
therapy, and we were able to achieve a low rate of
discontinuation.
In conclusion, the combination of dexamethasone
and the novel proteasome inhibitor bortezomib as a
maintenance therapy after salvage therapy induced clinically significant responses in patients with advanced MM.
In addition, the toxic effects were tolerable.
Further evaluation, including randomized studies,
are warranted to assess the role of bortezomib-containing
regimens as maintenance therapies in the treatment of
patients with advanced MM.
