ABSTRACT
Nonresolving inflammation in the intestine predisposes individuals to colitisassociated colorectal cancer (CAC), which leads to high morbidity and mortality. Here
we show that genistein-27 (GEN-27), a derivative of genistein, inhibited proliferation
of human colorectal cancer cells through inhibiting β-catenin activity. Our results
showed that GEN-27 increased expressions of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)
and axis inhibition protein 2 (AXIN2), and reduced β-catenin nuclear localization,
which resulted from the inhibition of NF-κB/p65 nuclear localization and up-regulation
of caudal-related homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2). Furthermore, GEN-27
decreased binding of p65 to the silencer region of CDX2 and increased binding of
CDX2 to the promoter regions of APC and AXIN2, thus inhibiting the activation of
β-catenin induced by TNF-α. Importantly, GEN-27 protected mice from azoxymethane
(AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colon carcinogenesis, with reduced
mortality, tumor number and tumor volume. Histopathology, immunohistochemistry
and flow cytometry revealed that dietary GEN-27 significantly decreased secretion of
proinflammatory cytokines and macrophage infiltration. Moreover, GEN-27 inhibited
AOM/DSS-induced p65 and β-catenin nuclear translocation, while promoted the
expression of CDX2, APC, and AXIN2. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that
the anti-proliferation effect of GEN-27 in vitro and the prevention of CAC in vivo
is mediated by p65-CDX2-β-catenin axis via inhibiting β-catenin target genes. Our
results imply that GEN-27 could be a promising candidate for the chemoprevention
of CAC.

INTRODUCTION

inflammation is closely related to the development
of colorectal cancer along with other factors such as
epigenetic abnormalities and genetic mutations [2-4]. It
has been shown that patients suffering from inflammatory
bowel diseases (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and
Crohn disease, are at increased risk of developing CRC

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common
malignant neoplasm worldwide and the second leading
cause of cancer related deaths in the United States [1].
As the seventh hallmark of cancer, cancer-associated

chemopreventive interventions for the high-risk
individuals are considered a viable alternative among
experts. Owing to the availability and safety, dietary
supplements have become a viable and important strategy
for preventing CRC [1].
Deregulation or constitutive activation of the Wnt/
β-catenin pathway has been shown to contribute to the
initiation and progression of different kinds of human
disorders, including early stages of sporadic CRC and
IBD-associated carcinogenesis [8, 9]. In normal cells,
most of β-catenin binds to cadherin in the cytomembrane,
regulating cell-cell adhesion, while β-catenin in the
cytoplasm is rapidly phosphorylated by glycogen synthase
kinase-3 beta (GSK3β) at Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 in
the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), axis inhibition
protein 2 (AXIN2), GSK-3β destruction complex and
is subsequently degraded by the proteasome [10]. In
tumor cells, inactivation of the APC/AXIN/GSK-3β
complex causes β-catenin accumulation in the cytosol
and its translocation into the nucleus, where it acts as a
co‑activator for TCF/LEF-mediated transcription and
modulates cell proliferation, survival and differentiation
[11]. This destruction complex thereby controls the
proliferation of colon cells by maintaining the level of
active β-catenin.
It has been shown that innate immune cells in
the stroma, such as tumor-associated macrophages,
play a crucial role in tumor growth, invasion and
neovascularization [12, 13]. Tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α), for example, is a proinflammatory cytokine
secreted by macrophages in acute inflammatory response
[14], and during sustained inflammation TNF-α level
within colonic mucosa is increased, which contributes
to the invasiveness of adenocarcinomas [15]. Due to
the ability of inducing growth factors and suppressing
apoptosis, TNF-α or activation of NF-κB pathway is
required for the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma
[16] and colorectal cancers [17, 18]. Furthermore, TNF-α
has been reported to increase the activity of Wnt/β-catenin
pathway in gastric tumor cells, colorectal cancer cells and
in a colitis-associated cancer mouse model [18-20].
The caudal-related homeobox transcription factor 2
(CDX2) is an important transcription factor which controls
the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation
in intestinal epithelium [21]. It has been shown that CDX2
is required for cytodifferentiation and villus morphology
of the intestinal cells [22-24]. Decreased expression of
CDX2 is often observed at the invasive front and in tumor
buddings [25, 26]. Owing to the low rate of mutations in
the CDX2 gene, it is likely that a regulatory mechanism
rather than genetic alterations contributes to the downregulation of CDX2. Indeed, RELA/p65, the subunit of
the key inflammatory transcription factor NFKB/NF-κB,
is claimed one of the regulators of CDX2 in colon cancer
cells [27]. Furthermore, CDX2 is able to enhance the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

expressions of APC and AXIN2 [28, 29], which lead to
stabilization of the degradation complex of cytoplasmic
β-catenin. Therefore, it is possible that the enhanced
tumorigenicity of CAC is caused by the down-regulated
CDX2 through activating β-catenin. Therefore, a better
understanding of the mutual regulation of inflammation
and carcinogenesis by TNF-α, NF-κB/p65, CDX2
and β-catenin will be essential for discovering new
therapeutics for CAC.
Genistein (GEN, Figure 1A) is a natural isoflavone
found in soybeans, a leguminous plant popular in
Asian countries. It exerts diverse biological functions
including chemopreventive properties against different
kinds of cancers including colorectal cancer [30, 31].
Therefore, thirty derivatives of GEN were designed and
synthesized, and among them, genistein-27(GEN-27)
(Figure 1A) exhibits much more potent anti-proliferation
activity against colon cancer cells compared with others.
Previously, GEN was reported to inhibit AOM-induced
colorectal cancer [32]. However, the effect of GEN and its
derivatives on colitis-associated colon tumor development
has not been investigated.
In the present study, we demonstrated that GEN-27
significantly inhibited proliferation of human colorectal
cancer cells through inhibiting the activity of p65CDX2-β-catenin axis. Importantly, supplementing the
diet with GEN-27 protects mice against azoxymethane
(AOM)/dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colon
carcinogenesis,indicating that GEN-27 could potentially
be usedfor the chemoprevention of colitis-associated
cancer.

RESULTS
GEN-27 inhibits proliferation of human colorectal
carcinoma cells
The chemical structures of genistein (GEN) and
genistein-27 (GEN-27) were shown in Figure 1A. In
order to access the effect of GEN-27 in human relevant
models, human colorectal carcinoma cell lines HCT116,
HT29, SW620 and normal colon epithelial cell line FHC
were treated with varying concentrations of GEN-27 for
24h (Figure 1B). A marked anti-proliferative activity was
observed in HCT116, HT29 and SW620 cells with IC50
value of 23.64 μM, 28.96 μM and 30.43 μM, respectively.
However, GEN-27 showed a lower cytotoxicity in normal
colon FHC cells, which indicates that cancer cells are
more sensitive to GEN-27 than normal cells. As shown
in Figure 1C, the percentage EdU-positive HCT116 cells
were reduced by GEN-27 in a dose-dependent manner,
which confirmed the anti-proliferation effect of GEN-27.
Cell cycle distribution of HCT116 cells was examined and

analyzed in HCT116 cells using the TOP/FOP-flash
reporter system. As shown in Figure 2C, the basal activity
of β-catenin was dose-dependently decreased by GEN27. Moreover, GEN-27 time- and dose-dependently
inhibited nuclear translocation of β-catenin and the
protein expressions of target genes including PCNA and
Cyclin D1 in HCT116 and HT29 cells (Figure 2A and
2B). Furthermore, the mRNA expressions of c-Myc,
Cyclin D1 and PCNA were also decreased by GEN27 treatment (Figure 2E). Interestingly, the mRNA and

protein levels of CDX2 and the mRNA expressions of
APC and AXIN2, which negatively regulate β-catenin
activity, were strongly increased (Figure 2A, 2B and 2E).

Given that E-cadherin and GSK3β play pivotal roles in
the distribution of β-catenin, we investigated the protein
levels of E-cadherin and p-GSK3β. As shown in Figure

contributes to the inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin
pathway by GEN-27 in vitro

2D, GEN-27 significantly inhibited p-GSK3β (S9)
levels, without affecting total GSK3β and E-cadherin.
Moreover, GEN-27 dose-dependently increased the level
of p-β-catenin (Ser37), which leads to its degradation by
proteasome. Altogether, these data indicate that GEN-27
inhibits the activity of β-catenin through increasing APC
and AXIN2 expressions of the destruction complex and
reducing the level of p-GSK3β (S9), which contributes
to the stability of the destruction complex and promotes
the phosphorylation of β-catenin, leading to the downregulation of the pro-proliferation genes.

As GEN-27 inhibited nuclear translocation of p65
and increased the expression of CDX2 (Figure 2A and
2B), we explored if the inhibition on β-catenin nuclear
translocation is related to the p65 nuclear distribution and
CDX2 expression. Firstly, p65 overexpression plasmid
was transfected into HCT116 cells, which was verified
by Western blot (Figure 3Aa). Compared with control,

(S37) was inhibited, while β-catenin nuclear translocation
as well as its target gene expression was increased by
overexpression of p65 (Figure 3Aa-d). Furthermore,
the reduction of β-catenin nuclear localization and the
lowered proliferation rate of HCT116 induced by GEN27 were remarkably blocked by the increased p65 level
(Figure 3Ab and e), suggesting that CDX2 and β-catenin

are downstream targets of p65. Secondly, to determine
if the inactivation of β-catenin induced by GEN-27 is
CDX2 dependent, we knocked down CDX2 with siRNA
(Figure 3Ba). As shown in Figure 3B, knock-down of the
CDX2 gene significantly reversed the GEN-27-induced
increase of APC, AXIN2 and p-β-catenin (S37), decrease
of β-catenin nuclear translocation, down-regulation of

human colon cancer cells

β-catenin target genes (Figure 3Bb and d), as well as
the inhibition of cell viability (Figure 3Be), while p65
nuclear translocation was not affected by the siCDX2
(Figure 3Bb), which confirmed the vital role of p65CDX2-β-catenin axis in the anti-proliferation effect of
GEN-27. Finally, to further investigate whether β-catenin
has an effect on the nuclear localization of p65 and
CDX2 expression, β-catenin overexpression plasmid was
transfected into HCT116 cells (Figure 3Ca). It was found
that the GEN-27-mediated inhibition of cell viability and
the decreased protein levels of β-catenin target genes
were reversed by the β-catenin overexpression, while the
p65 nuclear translocation and CDX2, APC and AXIN2
expressions were not affected (Figure 3Cb-e). These
observations show that GEN-27 inhibits p65 nuclear
translocation, which leads to the increased expression of
CDX2, APC, AXIN2 and p-β-catenin (S37), decreased
nuclear translocation of β-catenin, resulting in the downregulation of β-catenin target genes. In conclusion, GEN27 inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin pathway through inhibiting
the activity of p65-CDX2-β-catenin axis in HCT116 cells.

Proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α secreted
by macrophage, promotes tumorgenesis [18-20]. TNF-α
treatment caused elevated cell proliferation of HCT116
and HT29 cells as demonstrated by cell viability assay
(Figure 4A), and the p65-CDX2-β-catenin axis was also
activated in a time-dependent manner in HCT116 cells
(Figure 4B). Compared with GEN, GEN-27 pretreatment
significantly prevented TNF-α-induced activation of the
p65-CDX2-β-catenin axis, which can be concluded from
the β-catenin activity assay using TOP/FOP-flash reporter
system (Figure 4C), immunofluorescence (Figure 4D),
Western blot (Figure 4E) and Real-time PCR analysis
(Figure 4G and 4H). Knock-down of CDX2 with siCDX2
abolishes GEN-27’s inhibitory effect on β-catenin activity
in the presence of TNF-α (Figure S1A). Moreover, the
increase of p-GSK3β and the decrease of β-catenin
phosphorylation at Ser37 induced by TNF-α were also
reversed by pretreatment of GEN-27 (Figure 4F). It has
been reported that p65 could down-regulates CDX2

CDX2 could bind to upstream enhancer elements in the
APC and AXIN2 genes and therefore increase their protein
levels [33]. ChIP assay was performed to demonstrate the
binding of p65 on the silencer region of the CDX2 and

CDX2 on the enhancer elements of APC and AXIN2.

cells were immunoprecipitated with a p65 (Figure 4I) or

CDX2 silencer region after anti-p65 ChIP (Figure 4I)
and reduction of APC and AXIN2 enhancer regions after
anti-CDX2 ChIP (Figure 4J and 4K) were observed in the
TNF-α treated group, and GEN-27 and GEN pre-treatment
blocked the effect of TNF-α, which were correlated with
the mRNA analysis of CDX2, APC and AXIN2 (Figure
4G). Taken together, these results indicate that GEN-27
inhibits TNF-α-induced proliferation of human colon
cancer cells through down-regulating the activity of p65CDX2-β-catenin axis and reducing the expressions of the
β-catenin target genes.

6A). Expressions of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α,
IL-6 and IL-1β were also significantly suppressed (Figure
6B and 6C). Besides, we examined the macrophage
infiltration in colon tissues. Fewer CD11b+ cells
from GEN-27(45mg/kg)-treated mice were detected
compared with those from AOM/DSS group (Figure
6D). The accumulation of macrophages in the colons
was also investigated with flow cytometry (Figure 6E).
The percentage of F4/80+/CD11b+ cells increased from
2.4% to 17.7% in colon tissue from AOM/DSS group,
and it reduced to 5.4% and 11.2% after GEN-27 and
GEN treatment, respectively. This suppressive effect
of GEN-27 was correlated with its inhibition of colonic
inflammatory cytokines (Figure 6B and 6C). Taken
together, these results indicate that GEN-27 treatment
reduces macrophage activity and thereby ameliorates
AOM/DSS induced inflammation in a colitis-associated
colorectal cancer model.

GEN-27 prevents colitis-associated tumorigenesis
To determine whether GEN-27 directly inhibits the
formation of CAC, we generated an AOM/DSS induced
colitis-associated colon cancer model. GEN-27 was
well tolerated in mice, and no obvious systemic toxicity
was observed during the entire period of treatment as
indicated by the body weight, general appearance and
organ histology. Based on Kaplan-Meier survival curves
(Figure 5B), GEN-27, GEN and aspirin (ASP) treatment
increased the survival of mice. Body weight of the mice
was monitored throughout the experiment (Figure 5C).
Substantial weight loss following each exposure to DSS
and subsequent weight regain when being maintained on
water was observed (Figure 5C). In groups of GEN-27,
GEN and aspirin (ASP) treatment, the mice had a reduced
weight loss and recovered more quickly than mice in the
AOM/DSS group. The tumor incidence was 100% in all
mice. However, fewer and smaller tumors were observed
in the GEN-27 (45mg/kg) -treated group (P < 0.001)
(Figure 5D-5G). Tumor volume and average clinical
score were also reduced by GEN-27 in a dose-dependent
manner, which represent the total volume of all tumors
of a mouse and clinical parameters including weight loss,
stool consistency and bleeding, respectively. (Figure 5I
and 5J). Compared with the AOM/DSS group, there was
a significant increase in colon length of mice in the GEN27 (45mg/kg) group (P < 0.001) (Figure 5H). Moreover,
GEN-27 treatment inhibited the PCNA expression, which
indicates the cell proliferation in the colon (Figure 6B).
Hence, the data obtained here strongly suggest that a
diet supplemented with GEN-27 prevents colorectal
tumorigenesis in a mouse model of colitis associated CRC.

GEN-27 inhibits the p65-CDX2-β-catenin axis
in the AOM/DSS induced colitis-associated
colorectal cancer model
In order to determine if the inactivation of
p65-CDX2-β-catenin axis is responsible for the
chemoprevention effect of GEN-27 in vivo, the related
protein and mRNA levels from mouse colons were
assessed. As expected, the activity of p65-CDX2-βcatenin axis was markedly inhibited by GEN-27 compared
with the AOM/DSS group. Nuclear translocation of p65
(Figure 6A and Figure 7C) and β-catenin (Figure 7B and
7C), protein expressions of p-IKB-α, PCNA and Cyclin
D1 (Figure 7C), and mRNA expressions of c-Myc,
Cyclin D1 and PCNA (Figure 7D) in colonic tissue were
remarkably down-regulated. Besides, GEN-27 diet deeply
increased the protein and mRNA expression of the CDX2
and the mRNA levels of APC and AXIN2 compared
with the AOM/DSS group, which contributes to the
phosphorylation and degradation of β-catenin (Figure 7A,
7C and 7D). Together, these results indicate that GEN-27
administration prevent colitis-associated tumorigenesis
through inhibiting the activity of the p65-CDX2-β-catenin

DISCUSSION

GEN-27 attenuates inflammation in a colitisassociated colorectal cancer model

It has been reported that genistein (GEN) inhibits
AOM-induced colorectal cancer [30, 32]. Our results
also confirmed this inhibitory effect of GEN on Wnt/βcatenin pathway in mice with CAC (Figure 7B-7D) and
in HCT116 cells with or without TNF-α stimulation
(Figure 2A-2E and Figure 4C-4K). Compared with its
parent compound, GEN-27 exhibits much more potent
activities of chemoprevention against CAC in mice
and anti-proliferation against human colorectal cancer

In addition to the decreased colitis-associated
tumorigenesis in AOM/DSS-treated mice, we found that
the inflammation level was markedly reduced by GEN27. Nuclear translocation of NF-κB/p65 was markedly
reduced by GEN-27 compared with the AOM/DSS group
as shown by immunofluorescence cytochemistry (Figure

the nuclear translocation of p65, which increases the protein expression of CDX2. And the up-regulated CDX2 increases APC and AXIN2
gene expression, which activates the destruction complex and promotes the phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser37. As a consequence, GEN27 inhibits the target gene expressions including PCNA, Cyclin D1 and c-Myc, prevents the colitis-associated initiation, promotion, and
progression of tumor development. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 vs. AOM+DSS group. # P < 0.05, ## P < 0.01. GEN, genistein;

cells. Furthermore, the present data highlight the role of
CDX2 in the NFκB/p65-promoted activation of β-catenin
signaling. In the process of CAC, inflammatory cytokines,
such as TNF-α, induce phosphorylation of IκB-α, and
promote the nuclear translocation of p65, which inhibits
the protein expression of CDX2. And the down-regulated
CDX2 decreases APC and AXIN2 gene expression,
which inactivates the destruction complex and inhibits the
phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser37. As a consequence,
TNF-α induces the β-catenin target gene expressions
including PCNA, Cyclin D1 and c-Myc, thus promoting
the colitis-associated tumor development.
Dietary GEN-27 reduced inflammation, neutrophil
infiltration, cell proliferation, tumor burden, and mortality
associated with the AOM/DSS treatment. NF-κB/p65 and
β-catenin nuclear localization induced by AOM/DSS were
also reduced in the GEN-27-fed mice and in HCT116 and
HT29 colon cancer cells treated with GEN-27. GEN-27
did not affect the expression E-cadherin, but reduced the
level of p-GSK3β(S9), which results in the increase of
p-β-catenin (S37) (Figure 2D). These results suggest that
the anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activity of GEN27 is related to the activation of the destruction complex,
which phosphorylates β-catenin at Ser37 leading to its
destruction by the proteasome.
The proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α is a critical
mediator of inflammatory disorders and is likely to
activate signaling pathways involved in tumorigenesis
[17, 18]. And Wnt/β-catenin pathway can be activated by
TNF-α in gastric tumor cells, colorectal cancer cells, as
well as in a colitis-associated cancer mouse model [1820]. We demonstrate that TNF-α at the concentrations of
0-50 ng/ml promotes proliferation of HCT116 and HT29
cells through increasing β-catenin activity (Figure 4A and
4B). Besides, in AOM/DSS-induced CAC mice model,
the protein level of TNF-α is markedly elevated (Figure
6B and 6C), which indicates the connection between
inflammation and cancer. GEN-27 time-dependently
inhibited TNF-α-induced activation of β-catenin in vitro
and dose-dependently reduce TNF-α secretion in vivo
(Figure 4 and 6), which accounts for its anti-proliferation
and anti-inflammation effects.
It has been recently demonstrated that CDX2
regulates gene expression of APC and AXIN2, components
of the β-catenin degradation complex [33], and increasing
evidences indicate that CDX2 inhibits the activity of
β-catenin and thereby the progression of the colorectal
cancer [34, 35]. Previous studies reported that CDX2 loss
could be observed at the invasive front [20, 33], while we
detected CDX2 loss not only at the invasive front but also
in the adenoma induced by AOM/DSS in mice (Figure 7A,
red arrow). This is not surprising, because the protein level
of TNF-α is greatly elevated owing to induction of DSS in
the CAC model (Figure 6B and 6C), which deeply inhibits
the expression of CDX2 in tumor cells and malignant
transformed cells at the invasive front.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

A few number of studies have focused on the
activity and regulation of CDX2 expression. The published
works indicate that extracellular signal-regulated kinase
1/2 (ERK1/2) or p38 MAPK may be regulators of CDX2
[36-39]. It is demonstrated that TNF-α regulates the CDX2
expression through NF-κB in HT29 cells [27]. In our study,
we demonstrate that p65, as an up-steam regulator, downregulates CDX2 expression through binding to the silencer
region of the CDX2, and inhibiting the mRNA expression
of CDX2 at transcriptional level. Furthermore, by using
gain- and loss- of- function approaches, our results clearly
indicate that GEN-27 inhibits cancer cell proliferation
and inactivates Wnt pathway through regulating the p65CDX2-β-catenin axis, and this is the first report that p65
could increase the activity of β-catenin through downregulating CDX2 expression at the transcriptional level.
In conclusion, our study provides strong evidence
for the chemopreventive activity of GEN-27 against
colitis-associated colorectal cancer in mice through
inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin pathway. The mechanism
involves p-IκB-α-p65 pathway mediated CDX2-dependent
activation of the destruction complex, thus leading to
decreased expressions of β-catenin target genes including
cyclin D1, PCNA and c-Myc. GEN-27 could potentially
be used for the chemoprevention of colitis-associated
cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Human colon cancer cell lines (HCT116, HT29,
SW620) and normal colon epithelial FHC cell line were
obtained from Cell Bank of the Chinese Academic of
Sciences (Shanghai, China) and cultured in McCoy’s
5a medium supplemented with 10% FBS, RPMI-1640
medium supplemented with 10% FBS, DMEM medium
containing 10% FBS and DMEM medium containing 10%
FBS, respectively, in a 37°C humidified incubator with
5% CO2. GEN-27 was synthesized in Organic Chemistry
Laboratory of China Pharmaceutical University (>98%
purity, Nanjing Jiangsu, China). GEN and Fluorouracil
(5-FU) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (>98%
purity, St. Louis, MO). Cells were treated with GEN-27,
GEN or 5-FU at indicated concentrations and time points,
followed by TNF-α (Peprotech) based on pre-determined
experimental design. Cell viability was assessed by MTT
assay.

EdU cell proliferation assay
HCT116 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a
density of 2 × 105 cells per well. After adhesion, cells
were cultured in a standard culture medium or treated with
17880

Oncotarget

GEN-27 (5, 10, 20 μM), GEN (20 μM), and 5-FU (20 μM)
for 24 h. Cell proliferation was evaluated by measuring
EdU incorporation during DNA synthesis according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (Baseclick). EdU
incorporation was measured using immunofluorescence.

goat anti-rabbit HRP (cat. no.Ab203-01), goat anti-mouse
HRP (cat. no. Ab201-01) ( Vazyme Biotech); all secondary
antibodies were used at 1:40,000.

Real-time PCR

Cell cycle assay

RNA samples were reverse transcribed to cDNA
and the PCR reactions were performed using TaKaRa
SYBR Green Master Mix (Code. no. 638320) carried
out in StepOnePlus™ Real-Time PCR instrument (cat.
no. 4376600, Life Technologies). The program for
amplification was 1 cycle of 95°C for 2 min followed by
40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 95°C for 10
s. The primer sequences used in this study were listed in
the Supplementary data. The PCR results were normalized
to Gapdh expression and were quantified by the ΔΔCT
method.

After treatment with GEN-27 (5, 10, 20 μM), GEN
(20 μM), and 5-FU (20 μM) for 24 h, HCT116 cells were
harvested, spin down and the resulting pellets were fixed
in ice-cold 70% ethanol. Fixed cells were centrifuged,
washed and re-suspended in PBS containing RNase A (1
mg/ml), and propidium iodide (PI) was added (1.0 mg/ml).
PI-stained cells were analyzed by a fluorescence-activated
cell sorter (Accuri® C6, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes,
NJ, USA), followed by the determination of the percentage
of cells in G0/G1, S, and G2/M.

Immunofluorescence

TOP and FOP flash reporter assays

The immunofluorescence assay for NF-kB/p65 and
β-catenin nuclear translocation was performed according
to the method previously described [41].

For the analysis of β-catenin transcriptional activity,
HCT116 cells were co-transfected with TOP (T-cell factor
reporter plasmid)- or FOP (mutant T-cell factor reporter
plasmid)-flash luciferase and renilla luciferase plasmid.
Luciferase activity was divided by renilla activity to
normalize transfection efficiency.

Animal studies and colitis-associated colon cancer

Cytokine analysis by ELISA

Animal welfare and experimental procedures were
performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health,
the United States) and the related ethical regulations of
our university. Pathogen-free male C57BL/6 mice were
purchased from the Model Animal Research Center of
Nanjing University (Nanjing, China) at 5 weeks of age
and were exposed to a 12:12-hour light/dark cycle. Mice
were given an AIN-93G purified diet (Normal diet) from
Xietong-organism Co., LLC (Nanjing Jiangsu, China)
and drinking water ad libitum. At 6 weeks of age (Week
0, Figure 5A), mice were started on the indicated diet
(Supplementary Table 2) till the end of the experiment,
and two weeks later, mice were injected intraperitoneally
with AOM (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at a dose of 10 mg/
kg body weight, followed by 3 cycles of 2.5% DSS (MP
Biomedicals LL, Solon, OH) given in drinking water for
a week and then switch back to normal drinking water
for 2 weeks. The body weights were measured during the
experiment. Aspirin were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
Co., LLC (>98% purity, St. Louis, MO). Purified diets
were prepared by Xietong-organism Co., LLC (Nanjing
Jiangsu, China). Mice were allowed to eat ad libitum.
Mice were euthanized at the end of the experiment and
colon tissue harvested.
Preparation of colonic cell suspension and flow
cytometry were performed as previously described [44].
Body weight, the presence of rectal bleeding, and
stool consistency were scored and averaged to generate a
semiquantative clinical score as previously described [45].
In brief, body weight, colon lengths and stool consistency
were assessed at the completion of study. Rectal bleeding
was assessed by sampling for the presence of blood in the
stool using a Hemoccult Immunochemical Fecal Occult
Blood Test (Abon Biopharm CO., LTD) as previously
described [46].

Colon inflammatory cytokine was assessed by
flushing mice colons with PBS, and the distal-most 1-cm2
colon sections were cultured in RPMI media containing
penicillin/streptomycin for 24 h. Supernatants from these
cultures were removed, cleared of debris by centrifugation
and assessed for mouse IL-6 (EK0411), TNF-α (EK0527),
IL-1β (EK0394) (Boster Biological Technology) by
ELISA.

Statistical analysis
Most results are presented as the mean ± SD.
Significance between two groups was assessed by the
Student’s two-tailed t-test. The non-parametric MannWhitney U-test was used to assess significance between
two means of data sets lacking a normal distribution and
having a small sample size. Data sets consisting of more
than 2 groups were analyzed by analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with Tukey-Kramer HSD post test for multiple
comparisons if significance was determined. The product
limit method of Kaplan and Meier was used for generating
the survival curves. P value that was less than 0.05 was
considered statistically significant for all data sets. All
statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism
software.
