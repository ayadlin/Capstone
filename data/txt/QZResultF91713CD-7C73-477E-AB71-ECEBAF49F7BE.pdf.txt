Abstract
Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a transcription factor that regulates fundamental cellular
processes in response to changes in oxygen concentration. HIFα protein levels are increased in
most solid tumours and correlate with patient prognosis. The link between HIF and apoptosis, a
major determinant of cancer progression and treatment outcome, is poorly understood. Here we
show that Caenorhabditis elegans HIF-1 protects against DNA-damage-induced germ cell
apoptosis by antagonizing the function of CEP-1, the homologue of the tumour suppressor p53.
The antiapoptotic property of HIF-1 is mediated by means of transcriptional upregulation of the
tyrosinase family member TYR-2 in the ASJ sensory neurons. TYR-2 is secreted by ASJ sensory
neurons to antagonize CEP-1-dependent germline apoptosis. Knock down of the TYR-2
homologue TRP2 (also called DCT) in human melanoma cells similarly increases apoptosis,
indicating an evolutionarily conserved function. Our findings identify a novel link between
hypoxia and programmed cell death, and provide a paradigm for HIF-1 dictating apoptotic cell
fate at a distance.

Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) mediates cellular and systemic adaptive responses to
maintain oxygen homeostasis in all metazoan species. HIF heterodimer consists of an
oxygen-dependent α-subunit and a constitutively expressed β-subunit. Under normal
oxygen levels, prolyl hydroxylases (PHD1–PHD3) use oxygen as a substrate to modify
proline residues of HIFα1–3. Hydroxylated HIFα is recognized by the von Hippel–Lindau
tumour suppressor (VHL), a subunit of the VCB–Cul2 ubiquitin-ligase, and targeted for
proteasomal degradation4. Inactivation of VHL results in accumulation of HIFα protein and

is the underlying basis of von Hippel–Lindau disease5, a multisystem cancer syndrome.
HIFα levels are also increased as a consequence of intratumoral hypoxia as well as genetic
alterations in a variety of cancer types6,7. Increased HIFα levels have been shown to be
associated with increased mortality and treatment failure in many solid tumours8. However,
the molecular mechanisms underlying this correlation are still poorly understood.
A major determinant of tumour progression and cancer therapy is the ability of cancer cells
to activate apoptotic cell death9. Understanding how aberrant signalling within tumours can
interfere with apoptosis is therefore of particular importance.
The HIF and the apoptotic pathway are both evolutionarily highly conserved and are well
characterized in the nematode C. elegans. The C. elegans hif-1, aha-1 and vhl-1 genes
encode the single worm homologues of HIFα, HIFβ and VHL, whereas EGL-9 is the single
HIFα prolyl hydroxylase1,10. Furthermore, germline apoptosis induced by DNA damage
involves a conserved machinery of checkpoint proteins, the p53 homologue CEP-1, and the
core apoptotic machinery consisting of CED-9 (Bcl-2), CED-4 (Apaf1) and CED-3
(caspase)11–13. Here we use C. elegans to analyse the link between HIF-1 and apoptosis.

HIF-1 inhibits ionizing-radiation-induced apoptosis
HHMI Author Manuscript

To determine whether HIF-1 alters DNA-damage-induced apoptosis, we assessed germ lines
of wild-type and vhl-1(ok161) mutant animals. Loss of the negative regulator vhl-1 led to a
marked increase in HIF-1 levels (Fig. 1a), as previously shown1. Although ionizing
radiation (IR) and ultraviolet C (254 nm) induced an increase in the number of apoptotic
germ cells in wild type, no such increase was seen in vhl-1(ok161) mutant animals (Fig. 1b,
c, e and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Two lines of evidence indicate that the apoptotic defect in
vhl-1(ok161) mutants is due to stabilized HIF-1, rather than to an alternative function of
vhl-1. First, increasing HIF-1 levels via either hypoxia treatment or loss of egl-9 function
also conferred resistance to IR (Supplementary Fig. 2b, d). Second, loss of HIF-1 function
restored the sensitivity to IR in vhl-1(ok161) and egl-9(n586) mutant worms (Fig. 1d, f, g
and Supplementary Fig. 2c). Taken together, these results indicate that HIF-1 antagonizes
DNA-damage-induced apoptosis.

HHMI Author Manuscript

HIF-1 could antagonize apoptosis either by modulating the central apoptotic machinery or
by interfering with the upstream signalling pathways that activate the apoptotic machinery in
response to DNA damage. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we asked whether
HIF-1 also affects other outputs of the DNA damage response pathway that are independent
of apoptosis. We first monitored cell cycle arrest after IR in the mitotic germline
compartment. Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis are induced via a common, conserved
signalling cascade that branches into two distinct pathways upstream of CEP-1 (ref. 12;
Supplementary Fig. 1). vhl-1(ok161) worms showed a normal cell cycle arrest upon IR, as
assessed by the decrease in the number of proliferating cells in the stem cell compartment
(Supplementary Fig. 2e). Moreover, embryonic lethality—an indirect measure of failures in
DNA repair—was not affected by HIF-1, as we observed no significant change in
vhl-1(ok161) or hif-1(ia4) mutants compared to wild-type worms after IR (Supplementary
Table 1). Collectively, these findings indicate that the upstream DNA damage response
pathway is fully functional in vhl-1(ok161) mutants. Therefore, HIF-1 must act either
directly on the apoptotic machinery, or on the apoptosis-specific branch of the signalling
cascade (Supplementary Fig. 1).

HIF-1 antagonizes CEP-1/p53 function
To refine the site of action of HIF-1 further, we next asked whether HIF-1 directly
influences the core apoptotic machinery. In addition to mediating DNA-damage-induced

apoptosis, CED-3, CED-4 and CED-9 participate in physiological germ cell death, a cep-1/
p53-independent program that eliminates approximately 50% of all germ cells in the
absence of exogenous stress11. Physiological germ cell death was still readily observed in
vhl-1(ok161) and egl-9(n586) mutants, both of which overexpress HIF-1 (ref. 1) (Fig. 1a, e
and Supplementary Fig. 2b), suggesting that the core machinery is fully functional in these
mutants. Similarly, whereas mutations in ced-3 and ced-4 efficiently suppress ced-9(lf)dependent cell death11, germ cell apoptosis triggered by RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated
depletion of the Bcl-2 homologue CED-9 was not blocked in vhl-1(ok161) animals (Fig. 2a).
Taken together, these results suggest that HIF-1 antagonizes apoptosis at the level of either
CEP-1/p53 or the BH3-only domain protein EGL-1 (Supplementary Fig. 1) or that it acts in
parallel to this pathway.

HHMI Author Manuscript

In mammals, p53 is regulated via protein stability and post-translational modifications14. It
was recently shown that C. elegans CEP-1 is also phosphorylated upon IR15. To determine
whether HIF-1 alters CEP-1 activation, we compared CEP-1 levels by western blot analysis
in IR-treated wild-type, hif-1(ia4) and vhl-1(ok161) worms. IR treatment of wild-type
animals resulted in the appearance of two additional bands, representing phosphorylated
CEP-1 (Fig. 2b)15. hif-1(ia4) mutants showed two very distinctive phenotypes. First, CEP-1
protein levels were much higher than in wild-type animals (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Figs
3 and 4a–c). Second, phosphorylated CEP-1 was readily detectable even without IR
treatment (Fig. 2b). In vhl-1(ok161) mutants, which overexpress HIF-1, we observed a novel
CEP-1 migration pattern (Fig. 2b) that is distinct from the wild-type and phosphorylated
species reported previously15 and possibly represents a different type of CEP-1
modification. IR treatment of vhl-1(ok161) mutants resulted in a further shift in CEP-1
mobility (Fig. 2b). The strong changes in CEP-1 observed in vhl-1(ok161) and hif-1(ia4)
mutants suggest that HIF-1 controls, directly or indirectly, CEP-1 activation.

HIF-1 inhibits apoptosis via TYR-2

HHMI Author Manuscript

How could HIF-1 inhibit CEP-1? First, being a transcription factor, HIF-1 might promote
the expression of one or more antiapoptotic genes that antagonize CEP-1. Alternatively,
HIF-1 might directly interact with and regulate CEP-1. To discriminate between these two
scenarios, we stabilized HIF-1 by means of the vhl-1(ok161) mutation and simultaneously
knocked down the C. elegans HIFβ homologue aha-1 by RNAi to repress HIF-1
transcriptional activity (Supplementary Figs 2h and 5). We found that HIF-1 could not
inhibit apoptosis in the absence of AHA-1: aha-1(RNAi); vhl-1(ok161) animals were as
sensitive to IR as aha-1(RNAi) or wild-type control animals (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig.
4d). We thus conclude that HIF-1 antagonizes CEP-1 activation via transcriptional
upregulation of one or more antiapoptotic target genes.
Previous microarray studies of vhl-1(ok161) mutants and hypoxia-treated animals led to the
identification of putative transcriptional targets of HIF-1 (refs. 16, 17). To determine
whether any one of these targets might mediate the antiapoptotic activity of HIF-1, we tested
whether RNAi depletion of any of these genes restores IR-induced apoptosis in
vhl-1(ok161) mutants. Out of this set, only one gene, C. elegans tyrosinase tyr-2, was able to
restore sensitivity to IR (Supplementary Fig. 6). To confirm the specificity of our tyr-2
RNAi depletion, we next analysed worms carrying the tyr-2(ok1363) deletion allele
(Supplementary Fig. 7a–c). Whereas the tyr-2(ok1363) mutation did not alter IR response on
its own (Fig. 3b), it could restore the IR response defect of vhl-1(ok161) animals close to
wild-type levels (68–85%, Fig. 3c). We confirmed that tyr-2 expression is regulated by
HIF-1 using quantitative RT–PCR: relative tyr-2 messenger RNA levels in vhl-1(ok161),
wild-type and hif-1(ia4) worms were 1.74 ± 0.47 (s.d.), 1 and 0.30 ± 0.45, respectively. Our

results indicate that HIF-1 antagonizes DNA-damage-induced apoptosis to a large part via
transcriptional upregulation of the tyrosinase family member TYR-2.

HHMI Author Manuscript

TYR-2 is one of four annotated tyrosinase family members in the C. elegans genome. Given
that loss of tyr-2 did not fully restore the apoptotic defect in vhl-1(ok161) mutants, we asked
whether one of the other three tyrosinases might act in a partially redundant manner with
TYR-2. We therefore used RNAi to deplete tyr-1, tyr-3 and tyr-4 in vhl-1(ok161) or
vhl-1(ok161); tyr-2(ok1363) worms and analysed IR-induced apoptosis. Intriguingly,
tyr-3(RNAi) led to an increase in apoptosis in both genetic backgrounds (Supplementary
Fig. 8g, h). Consistent with the RNAi results, apoptosis was partially restored in
tyr-3(ok1194); vhl-1(ok161) double mutants (Supplementary Fig. 4e, f), and essentially back
to wild-type levels in the tyr-3(ok1194); tyr-2(ok1363); vhl-1(ok161) triple mutants (Fig.
3d). Deficiency in TYR-2 and TYR-3 also caused an increase in CEP-1 levels after IR (Fig.
3e and Supplementary Fig. 4b). Taken together, these findings lead us to propose a model in
which HIF-1 acts via TYR-2 and TYR-3 to downregulate CEP-1 levels, thereby impeding
apoptosis after DNA damage.

HHMI Author Manuscript

tyr-2(ok1363), tyr-3(ok1194) as well as hif-1(ia4) mutants showed increased basal levels of
apoptosis in the absence of IR, most evidently at the 36 h after young adult stage (Figs 1g
and 3b and Supplementary Fig. 4e). Because we observed increased CEP-1 levels in the
absence of HIF-1 (Fig. 2b), we asked whether these elevated basal levels of germ cell
apoptosis are dependent on CEP-1 function. Indeed, CEP-1 deficiency suppressed the
increase in apoptosis in all three mutant backgrounds (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 2i).
Thus, lack of TYR-2 and TYR-3 results in overactivation of CEP-1 and excessive germ cell
death.

TYR-2 is expressed in ASJ neurons
Because the antiapoptotic effect of HIF-1 is, to a large extent, mediated by TYR-2, we
focused on the tyr-2 gene and asked how TYR-2 induction might inhibit CEP-1-dependent
apoptosis. As a first step, we analysed the tyr-2 expression pattern using two transcriptional
GFP reporter lines. Under normoxic conditions, tyr-2 was expressed in the uterine muscles
and in the hypodermis (Supplementary Fig. 8e, f). However, HIF-1 stabilization by means of
the vhl-1(ok161) mutation led to additional expression in two neurons in the head (Fig. 4a
and Supplementary Fig. 8a–d). On the basis of their position and their ability to take up the
dye 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate (DiD)18, we
identified these two cells as the ASJL and ASJR amphid sensory neurons (Fig. 4b–g).

HHMI Author Manuscript

Because apoptosis was induced in the germ line rather than in these neurons, we investigated
the possibility that HIF-1 acted cell non-autonomously. HIF-1 is ubiquitously expressed, but
is not detectable in an adult animal under normoxia due to its rapid proteasome-dependent
degradation. In vhl-1(ok161) mutants, stabilized HIF-1::GFP could be observed ubiquitously
in the somatic tissues (Supplementary Figs 9c and 11g). However, HIF-1::GFP was not
detectable in mitotic to pachytene zones of the germ line (Supplementary Fig. 9d–i) and was
only present in mature, diakinesis stage oocytes, in the somatic gonadal sheath cells and in
the distal tip cell (Supplementary Fig. 9f–i). The failure to detect HIF-1 in the cells
undergoing apoptosis (Supplementary Figs 9–11) suggests that HIF-1 might regulate IRinduced germ cell apoptosis cell non-autonomously. Given the HIF-1-dependent expression
of TYR-2 in the ASJ neurons, we hypothesized that these two neurons might be required for
the inhibitory effect of HIF-1 on apoptosis.
To test this prediction, we specifically ablated the ASJ neurons in vhl-1(ok161) animals
using laser microbeam surgery and tested whether this affected the rate of apoptosis after IR.
The results unambiguously showed that the inhibitory effect of HIF-1 was eliminated by

ablating both ASJ sensory neurons, but not by mock ablation (Fig. 5a). Moreover, ablating
either ASJ neuron sensitized animals to IR and resulted in apoptotic levels intermediate
between the vhl-1(ok161) and vhl-1(ok161); tyr-2(ok1363) animals (Fig. 5a). To confirm
that the consequences of ASJ ablation were specific to the effect of HIF-1, rather than
generally sensitizing worms to DNA-damage-induced apoptosis, we similarly ablated ASJ
neurons in wild-type worms and did not find any significant increase in apoptosis
(Supplementary Fig. 12a). Therefore, our results indicate that stabilized HIF-1 in ASJ
sensory neurons results in TYR-2 expression, which in turn antagonizes DNA-damageinduced apoptosis in the germ line.
Our model predicts that constitutive expression of TYR-2 in ASJ neurons would inhibit
apoptosis in germ cells. To test this prediction, we overexpressed TYR-2 in the ASJ
neurons. As the model predicted, we found that expression of TYR-2, via the ASJ-specific
trx-1 promoter, was sufficient to suppress the increased basal apoptotic levels arising from
TYR-2 deficiency and inhibited DNA-damage-induced apoptosis almost completely (Table
1 and Supplementary Table 2).

Secreted TYR-2 blocks germline apoptosis

HHMI Author Manuscript

How could HIF-1-dependent TYR-2 expressed in ASJ sensory neurons regulate apoptosis in
the germ line? Tyrosinase family members possess a signal peptide that targets the protein
either to melanosomes19 or the extracellular environment20. Analysis of the TYR-2 protein
sequence revealed that its first 22 amino acids also form a putative signal peptide
(Supplementary Figs 12b and 13a–d). This finding raised the possibility that HIF-1-induced
TYR-2 could be secreted from the ASJ sensory neurons into the pseudocoelomic fluid to
impede germ cell apoptosis.
We reasoned that TYR-2 could act at a distance in two ways. First, TYR-2 could be taken up
by endocytosis and subsequently act in germ cells directly. Alternatively, a small molecule,
for example, a melanin-related metabolite, produced by TYR-2 in the pseudocoelomic fluid
could diffuse and act in germ cells. To distinguish between these possibilities, we knocked
down rme-2, a gene required for endocytosis in the gonad21, and asked whether blockage of
gonadal endocytosis restores germline apoptosis in vhl-1(ok161) mutants upon IR. We
found that deficiency in RME-2 completely restored DNA-damage-induced apoptosis in
vhl-1(ok161) mutants (Fig. 5b), but neither sensitized wild-type worms to IR nor resulted in
an engulfment phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 14a). These findings are consistent with the
notion that TYR-2 may be secreted and may enter the gonad by endocytosis.

HHMI Author Manuscript

If this model is correct, ectopic expression of TYR-2 in the germ line should be sufficient to
prevent apoptosis caused by IR. We therefore expressed modified TYR-2 protein that lacks
the signal peptide in the germ line (TYR-2-SP). TYR-2 expression as a result of this
construct rescued tyr-2(ok1363) mutants and completely prevented DNA-damage-induced
apoptosis, asserting again that TYR-2 acts in the germ line to antagonize apoptosis (Table 1
and Fig. 5c, d). In contrast, TYR-2-SP expressed under the control of the endogenous tyr-2
promoter did not protect against IR-induced apoptosis (Table 1, Fig. 5e and Supplementary
Fig. 13a–d). To explore the possibility that other proteins in addition to TYR-2 could be
taken up by endocytosis to assist TYR-2, we blocked endocytosis by rme-2(RNAi) in worms
expressing TYR-2-SP in the germ line. We found that these worms were still completely
defective in DNA-damage-induced apoptosis (Table 1). Collectively, these experiments
indicate that TYR-2 within germ cells is necessary and sufficient to inhibit DNA-damageinduced apoptosis.
In humans, the tyrosinase family consists of tyrosinase, which converts L-tyrosine into LDOPA, tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TRP1; also called TYRP1) and tyrosinase-related

protein 2 (TRP2; also called DCT), which shows no oxidase activity but instead acts as a Ldopachrome tautomerase to catalyse L-dopachrome to 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic
acid22,23. To determine TYR-2 enzymatic activity, we analysed recombinant, bacterially
expressed GST::TYR-2. We found that like mammalian TRP2, GST::TYR-2 had no
detectable tyrosinase activity (Supplementary Fig. 15), but showed L-dopachrome
tautomerase activity (Fig. 5f).
On the basis of the antiapoptotic properties of C. elegans TYR-2 and its homology to human
TRP2, we hypothesized that TRP2 might similarly represent a negative regulator of
apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, we knocked down TRP2 by short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
in human WM266-4 metastatic melanoma cells and analysed cisplatin-induced apoptosis
(Supplementary Fig. 16). TRP2 knock down (shDCT374) increased cisplatin-induced
apoptosis compared to control shRNA in WM266-4 cells (Fig. 5h, i, l and Supplementary
Fig. 17). This phenotype was rescued by expression of wild-type TRP2 but not of the
catalytically inactive point mutant TRP2(H189A/R194A) (Fig. 5j, k).

HHMI Author Manuscript

Three further traits were reminiscent of C. elegans TYR-2. First, shDCT374 and
shDCT374;TRP2(H189A/R194A) melanoma cells exhibited both higher basal apoptotic
fractions, compared to control shRNA cells, under untreated conditions (Supplementary Fig.
17). Second, TRP2, which normally localizes to melanosomes—specialized pigment
organelles produced only in melanocytes—was found to localize to the nucleus in some
(including WM266-4), but not all, melanoma cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 18). Last, in
analogy to TYR-2-mediated CEP-1 inhibition, we asked whether human TRP2 impinges on
p53 levels. We found that TRP2 knock down in WM266-4 melanoma cells increased basal
and cisplatin-induced p53 levels (Fig. 5l). We conclude from this set of experiments that
human TRP2 counteracts apoptotic cell death induction, possibly by means of its Ldopachrome tautomerase activity, and negatively affects the p53 pathway.

Discussion
Understanding the molecular events that contribute to resistance towards DNA-damageinduced apoptosis is of fundamental importance in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy9. We
present evidence suggesting that stabilization of C. elegans HIF-1 in ASJ sensory neurons
promotes expression of the tyrosinase family member TYR-2. We propose that TYR-2 acts
as a pro-survival signalling molecule: after its secretion by the ASJ sensory neurons, TYR-2
acts on the germ line, directly or indirectly, as a critical negative regulator of CEP-1, thereby
antagonizing DNA-damage-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5g). Our findings uncover a novel
pathway by which two single neurons regulate apoptotic fate in another tissue.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Previous work has shown that behavioural responses of C. elegans to oxygen are controlled
by the activity of the URX, AQR and PQR sensory neurons24,25. Here we present a second
type of systemic response to hypoxia controlled by two different sensory neurons that have
not been previously implicated in oxygen sensing. ASJ sensory neurons represent the major
ultraviolet-sensitive cells mediating negative phototaxis and have been reported to control
exit from the dauer stage26,27. C. elegans inhabits soil environments that vary from
practically 0% to 21% oxygen. Worms are forced to move into hypoxic soil areas in search
of bacteria, which consume oxygen faster than it diffuses. While feeding in such regions, the
ASJ sensory neurons may protect germ cells from apoptosis, and thus may ensure that
reproduction is not jeopardized. Notably, the role of the ASJ sensory neurons in hypoxia
response is reminiscent of the mammalian carotid body, which transduces a fall in arterial
oxygen partial pressure into systemic adaptation to hypoxia.

How could CEP-1 function be regulated by TYR-2? We found that in the absence of its
signal peptide, TYR-2 localized to the nucleus. Nuclear localization of both TYR-2 and
CEP-1 would be consistent with the possibility that TYR-2 directly interacts with, and
perhaps modifies, CEP-1. Indeed, various tyrosinases have been shown to directly
hydroxylate tyrosyl residues on proteins28,29. However, we failed to observe mass changes
in CEP-1 peptides by MS/MS after in vitro incubation with TYR-2 (Supplementary Figs 19
and 20). Nonetheless, because tautomerization does not result in amass change, tautomerase
activity cannot be excluded as a putative mechanism.

HHMI Author Manuscript

The antiapoptotic activity of TYR-2 is interesting in the light of reports that the human
homologue TRP2 mediates resistance of melanomas to DNA-damaging agents30. Our data
indicate that TRP2 counteracts apoptotic cell death induction, possibly by affecting p53
levels, and may therefore allow survival even in the absence of p53 mutations, which—
unusual for such an aggressive cancer—are rarely present in melanomas31. Activating
BRAF mutations in melanomas occur at a frequency of 50–70% and drive cancer
progression by controlling the level of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor
(MITF)32,33. Given that TRP2 in turn is transcriptionally regulated by MITF34, our findings
suggest that TRP2 could act downstream of BRAF to affect tumour progression and therapy.
The existence of such a potent antiapoptotic factor in melanocytes might be explained by its
function: melanocytes must survive ultraviolet light to produce melanin; using the same
pathway to promote both melanin synthesis and survival would be an elegant solution to this
problem.
The antiapoptotic action of HIF-1 and TRP2 could also be present in other types of cancer.
For instance, TRP2 was expressed in metastatic but not in non-metastatic human colorectal
carcinoma cells35. We suggest that increased HIFα levels could induce tyrosinases such as
TRP2 and thereby may provide an as yet unrecognized explanation for the correlation
between increased HIFα and patient mortality.
Our discovery that TYR-2 acts cell non-autonomously is of particular interest, as it raises the
possibility that HIFα stabilization in hypoxic areas of a tumour could increase viability of
cancer cells in other parts of the tumour, thereby providing a paradigm for a cell nonautonomous regulation of p53-dependent apoptosis. Such a cell non-autonomous mechanism
would introduce an additional layer of complexity within the tumour, as apoptotic cell fate
would not only be dictated by the set of genetic alterations carried by a given tumour cell,
but would also be influenced by the vicinity of hypoxic cells. If our model is correct, TRP2
might represent an intriguing target for therapeutic strategies.

ASJ neurons in L1/L2 animals were identified using DiD staining (20 µM for 2 h) as
previously described18. Synchronized L1/L2 animals were ablated, or mock-ablated in
parallel, using a laser microbeam as described previously38. Worms were allowed to recover
on plates, and irradiated upon reaching the young adult stage (12 h post L4/adult). Germline
apoptosis was quantified 24 h after treatment followed by ASJ neuron survey. Ablation of
ASJ neurons was confirmed by either absence of GFP signal in opIs216[Ptyr-2::gfp];
vhl-1(ok161) animals or absence of DiD staining of the ASJ neurons in wild-type animals.
Strains
The following mutations were used: vhl-1(ok161), egl-9(n586), hif-1(ia4), tyr-2(ok1363),
tyr-3(ok1194), cep-1(gk138), cat-2(e1112).
Transgenic lines
The following transgenic lines were used: opIs206[Phif-1::hif-1::gfp::hif-1(3′ UTR)],
opIs216[Ptyr-2::gfp::let-858(3′ UTR)], opIs217[Ptyr-2::gfp::let-858(3′ UTR)],

RNAi screen for HIF-1 target genes mediating antiapoptotic function
Staged vhl-1(ok161) L1 were transferred to plates seeded with bacteria expressing the
respective RNAi clone37. Worms were grown to the young adult stage (12 h after the L4/
adult moult) and were irradiated with 120 Gy as described above. Germline apoptosis was
quantified 24 h after treatment.
Western blot analysis

HHMI Author Manuscript

Synchronized young adult worms were exposed to 120 Gy ionizing radiation. Worms were
collected at indicated time points in lysis buffer (250 mM sucrose, 10 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM
EDTA, 1 mM PMSP, phosphatase inhibitor). Proteins were extracted by adding 212–300
mm glass beads (Sigma) and treating the worms with a BIO101/Savant FastPrep FP120 cell
disrupter for 3 times for 45 s. Extracts were centrifuged for 10 min and the supernatant was
heated to 90 °C for 10 min in Laemmli buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE,
transferred to PVDF (Amersham) membrane, and immunoblotted with CEP-1 antibody (gift
from A. Gartner). To reduce nonspecific staining, CEP-1 antibody was pre-absorbed with
OP50 acetone-powder and cep-1(gk138) acetone worm powder over night at 4 °C. β-Actin
antibody (Sigma) was used as loading control.
Immunohistochemistry
For CEP-1 immunostaining, dissected gonads from synchronized young adult worms (12 h
post L4 stage) were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, 100 mM K2HPO4 for 30 min and treated
with methanol for 20 min. Antibody incubations and washes were performed as described40.

Affinity-purified polyclonal anti-CEP-1 antibody was used at 1:50 dilution and Alexa 488
secondary antibody at 1:300 dilution.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Melanoma cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and incubated with anti-Pep8 (1:400) TRP2
antibody (provided by V. Hearing) and Alexa 488 secondary antibody (1:400). Cells were
mounted in Vectashield mounting medium.
-Dopachrome tautomerase activity

L

Enzymatic activity was determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring the decrease in
absorbance at 475 nm. Fresh solutions of L-dopachrome were prepared by oxidation of Ldopa with silver (I) oxide, as previously described41. L-Dopa (0.5 mM) in 0.05 M sodium
phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, was shaken vigorously with silver (I) oxide for 5 min. The final
suspension was filtered through a 0.45 µm Millipore filter. Solutions were immediately used
for kinetic experiments.
Tyrosinase activity
Enzymatic activity was determined spectrophotometrically by monitoring absorbance at 475
nm. 0.5 mM L-tyrosine solution in 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, was incubated
with the enzyme. Mushroom tyrosinase was obtained from Sigma (specific activity 2,085 U
mg−1).

Embryonic survival assay
Synchronized L4 larvae were exposed to different dosages of IR, transferred to fresh plates
24 h after treatment and were allowed to lay eggs for 8 h. Adults were then removed and
eggs were counted. Unhatched eggs were quantified 24 h later and percentage of embryonic
survival was calculated.
Antibody production
HIF-1 rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against the HIF-1 peptides
DDTRDYIGRQPEIVEC and DRSPPAKRMHQSGPS (Eurogentech). Antibody was affinity
purified.
Multiple alignment
Alignments were performed using MUSCLE software42.
Protein analysis

HHMI Author Manuscript

Gel bands were cut in small pieces and washed twice with 100 µl of 100 mM
NH4HCO3/50% acetonitrile, then washed once with 50 µl acetonitrile. All three supernatants
were discarded. Ten microlitres trypsin was added (0.01 mg µl−1 in 10 mM Tris/2 mM
CaCl2, pH 8.2) with 10 µl buffer (10 mM Tris/2 mM CaCl2, pH 8.2), and incubated over
night at 37 °C. Supernatant was removed and gel pieces were extracted twice with 100 µl
0.1% TFA/50% acetonitrile. All three supernatants were combined and dried. Samples were
dissolved in 15 µl 0.1% TFA. The samples were desalted by using Ziptip C18 and were
mixed 1:1 with matrix solution (5 mg ml−1 HCCA in 0.1% TFA/50% ACN). Samples were
measured by MALDI/MS and MALDI/MS/MS.
Cell culture
Human cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, InvitrogenGibco), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 U ml−1 penicillin, 50 µg ml−1
streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2.

Vectors

HHMI Author Manuscript

All retroviruses were generated using the murine stem cell virus (MSCV) backbone
(Clontech). For the expression of miR-30 based shRNAs (shRNA-mirs), we used the
retroviral vector MSCV-LTRmiR30-PIG (LMP) described previously43. The shRNAs were
cloned into LMP as 110-bp XhoI–EcoRI fragments obtained by annealing oligonucleotides
generating sticky ends. Guide strands were designed to target both isoforms of the human
dopachrome tautomerase TRP2, and had the following sequences (5′–3′): shDCT197,
UGUGAUUCAAACAACUAACAGA; shDCT223, UACAUGAACGUGCACACACAAU;
shDCT374, UUACUUUCCUUGUCUCUGUCGU; shDCT1180,
UGUACACACAUCACACUCGUUC; shDCT1182, UCUGUACACACAUCACACUCGU;
shDCT1371, AAGGUUGGCAAUUUCAUGCUGU; shDCT1372,
UAAGGUUGGCAAUUUCAUGCUG.
An shRNA efficiently targeting firefly luciferase (shLuc1309) was used as control44. The
coding sequence of human TRP2 was amplified by PCR from the IMAGE clone 4705935
(imaGenes, clone IRATp970E0539D) and XhoI–MfeI ligated into MSCV-LTR-PGKHygro. A catalytically inactive TRP2 mutant (H189A/R194A) was obtained by site-directed
mutagenesis.
Retroviral transduction

HHMI Author Manuscript

Cells were transduced as previously described45; however, target cells were infected only
once without centrifugation. Retroviral co-transduction was carried out as previously
described46. Efficiency of retroviral transduction of GFP expressing constructs was assessed
48 h after infection by flow cytometry (Guava EasyCyte, Guava Technologies). Transduced
cell populations were selected 48 h after infection, using either 2.5 mg ml−1 puromycin
(Sigma) or 400 mg ml−1 hygromycin B (Roche).
Antibodies for western blot analysis of human cells
Blots were probed with antibodies against tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TRP2) (Pep8,
1:4,000, gift from V. Hearing), p53 (DO1, 1:500, Abcam) or β-actin (AC-15, 1:15000,
Sigma).
FACS analysis using Annexin-V/PI staining

HHMI Author Manuscript

Human melanoma cells were treated with cisplatin for 24 h. Both attached and floating cells
were collected. Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and re-suspended in
Annexin-V binding buffer (Invitrogen). Thereafter, 5 µl Annexin-V-APC (BD Biosciences)
and 1 µl propidium iodide (PI) (1 mg ml−1) were added to 100 µl cell suspension and
incubated for 20 min in the dark. Finally, 400 µl Annexin-V binding buffer was added. Cells
were analysed on a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer.

a, Laser microbeam ablation of ASJ neurons. Germline apoptosis of laser-ablated and mockablated animals was quantified 24 h after irradiation and the presence of GFP-positive ASJ
neurons was determined subsequently. The number of intact ASJ neurons is indicated.
Representative head and appendant germ lines are shown on the right; mock-ablated animals
in the top row, ASJ-ablated animals are shown in the bottom row. Arrows indicate ASJ
neurons; arrowheads apoptotic germ cells. Scale bars, 10 µm. b, Germline endocytosis was
inhibited by rme-2(RNAi) and germ cell apoptosis quantified. Data shown represent the
average of three independent experiments ± s.d. (n > 20 animals). c, d, DIC microscopy
section and TYR-2::GFP nuclear localization in the germ line of Phus-1::tyr-2SP::gfp::tyr-2(3′ region) animals, which express TYR-2 lacking the signal peptide (amino
acids 1–22). Scale bars, 5 µm. e, Nuclear localization of TYR-2::GFP in Ptyr-2::tyr-2SP::gfp::tyr-2(3′ region) animals. Hypodermal nuclei are depicted. Scale bar, 5 µm. f, Ldopachrome tautomerase activity of GST::TYR-2, GST::GFP and mushroom tyrosinase. g,
Model for HIF-1-mediated inhibition of germline apoptosis. h–k, Loss of human tyrosinaserelated protein 2 (TRP2; also called DCT) results in increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis in
WM266-4 metastatic melanoma cells. Melanoma cells were treated with 50 µM cisplatin,
stained with Annexin-V/propidium iodide (PI) 24 h after treatment and analysed by flow
cytometry. TRP2 knock down (shDCT374) increases Annexin-V positive/PI negative
fractions (early apoptotic cells) compared to control shRNA (Luciferase) in WM266-4
melanoma cells (h, i). The shDCT374 (targeting endogenous TRP2 5′ UTR) phenotype is
rescued by expression of wild-type TRP2 (MSCV-DCT) (j), but not of the catalytically
inactive point mutant TRP2(H189A/R194A) (MSCV-DCT)(k). Data shown are
