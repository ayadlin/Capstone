Abstract
Over four decades ago, speciﬁc tumor characteristics were ascribed to the increased expression of sialic acid
sugars on the surface of cancer cells, and this led to the deﬁnition of sialic acids as potential therapeutic targets.
Recent advances in glycobiology and cancer research have deﬁned the key processes underlying aberrant
expression of sialic acids in cancer, and its consequences, more precisely. These consequences include effects on
tumor growth, escape from apoptosis, metastasis formation, and resistance to therapy. Collectively, these novel
insights provide further rationale for the design and development of therapeutic approaches that interfere with
excessively high expression of sialic acids in cancer cells. Strategies to target aberrant sialylation in cancer,
however, have evolved comparatively slowly. Here, we review recent ﬁndings that emphasize the detrimental
effects of hypersialylation on multiple aspects of tumor growth and behavior. We also discuss novel therapeutic
strategies. Cancer Res; 74(12); 3199–204. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Tumor cells of various origins feature increased expression
of sialic acid sugars on membrane glycoproteins and glycolipids and their secretion into the tumor microenvironment.
Sialic acids are synthesized in and expressed by essentially
every vertebrate cell, and are involved in multiple different
physiologic processes. However, hypersialylation of tumor cells
relative to their untransformed normal counter parts specifically beneﬁts tumor cell growth and correlates with a poor
prognosis for patients with cancer (1, 2). Sialic acids comprise a
family of more than 50 carbohydrates that share a nine-carbon
backbone (C1-9) to which speciﬁc chemical modiﬁcations are
enzymatically attached inside the cell. The most common sialic
acid derivate found in mammals is N-Acetylneuraminic acid
(Neu5Ac) which bears an acetyl group on the ﬁfth carbon atom
(C5). In general, sialic acids terminate the outer end of glycans
(sialoglycans), where they are enzymatically linked to other
carbohydrates, such as the monosaccharide galactose, by
glycosidic bonds. This enzymatic process is carried out by
more than 20 distinct Golgi-resident sialyltransferases (ST)
that link sialic acids via their second carbon (C2) to the carbon
atom at position C3 (ST3Gal I-VI), C6 (ST6Gal I,II and ST6GalNAc I-VI), or to C8 (ST8Sia I-VI) of carbohydrates, yielding
a2,3-, a2,6-, or a2,8-linked sialic acids, respectively (3). The
latter enzymes are also involved in creating a2,8-linked polysialic acids (PSA). Together, the multifarious chemical substitu-

tions, the different linkages to underlying sugars, and their
spatial and temporal organization result in a tremendous diversity of sialoglycans, termed the sialome by Cohen and Varki (4).
Although we have just begun to understand the biology of
the sialome and its implications in pathology, sialoglycans are
known to regulate glycoprotein and glycolipid structure, stability, trafﬁcking, and function. Moreover, their prominent
position on the cell membrane allows sialoglycans to effectively participate in cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix
interaction, including adhesion, migration, and immune recognition (3). There are receptor families that speciﬁcally
recognize sialoglycans such as selectins or sialic acid-binding
immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs). Selectins are expressed
on endothelial cells and leukocytes and enable extravasation of
immune cells to sites of inﬂammation and also allow hematogenous spread of cancer cells. Siglecs are expressed on most
cells of the immune system and can transmit immunosuppressive signals upon binding to sialic acid ligands. Increased
expression of siglec ligands by tumor cells could thus contribute to tumor immune evasion (5–7).
In line with their vital role in many physiologic processes,
several lines of evidence imply that aberrant expression of sialic
acids confers major advantages to tumor cells, ranging from
inhibition of apoptosis to resistance to cancer therapy. For
these reasons, strategies to block aberrant sialylation on tumors
may be highly beneﬁcial, not only to directly limit tumor
growth, but also to enhance the effect of cancer therapeutics.

Mechanisms of Aberrant Sialylation in Cancer
To date, three key mechanisms have been reported to cause
aberrant sialylation in cancer cells. First, overexpression and/
or altered activity of sialyltransferases results in increased
sialylation of glycans and expression of speciﬁc tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens (e.g., sLex/a, STn, GD2, GD3, or
PSA; refs. 8, 9). The proto-oncogenes, Ras and c-Myc, have been
shown to control transcription of the sialyltransferases ST6Gal
I and ST3Gal I, II, and IV, respectively. This has been reported to

result in increased a2,6-sialylation of b1-integrin (Ras) and
high expression of sLex/a antigens (c-Myc), both facilitating
tumor cell motility (10, 11). In addition, low oxygen levels and
high hormone levels have been found to upregulate expression
of sialyltransferases. Hypoxia eventually selects highly aggressive tumor cells and is associated with a poor prognosis in
patients. Low oxygen levels were found to induce ST3Gal I
expression and subsequently sLex/a antigen synthesis in colon
cancer cells, eventually favoring binding to selectins and entry
into the blood stream (12). Hatano and colleagues demonstrated that in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cells, androgens control transcription of ST3Gal II sialyltransferase by
inducing promoter demethylation, resulting in high GD1a
expression, a sialoganglioside involved in tumor progression
(13). Multiple other studies have reported overexpression of
sialyltransferases in tumor tissue indicating that sialyltransferase upregulation is a dominant mechanism underlying hypersialylation in cancer.

The second mechanism was proposed by Almaraz and
colleagues, who provided evidence that the metabolic ﬂux
through the sialic acid synthesis pathway is enhanced in
cancer cells due to increased substrate availability or overexpression of genes involved in sialic acid biosynthesis. They
demonstrated that sialylation of glycoproteins increased
dramatically when enhancing the ﬂux rate through the sialic
acid pathway by the addition of sialic acid precursors to
cancer cells in vitro (14). Interestingly, mainly glycoproteins
afﬁliated with extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions
and cell migration were found to be hypersialylated, instead
of gross upregulation of protein sialylation. Whether this
is truly a tumor-speciﬁc phenomenon remains to be
answered, but these data imply that metabolic changes in
sialic acid biosynthesis in the tumor microenvironment can
lead to hypersialylation of cancer cells, and therefore alter
the expression of molecules involved in migration and
metastasis.

Sialic Acids Sweeten a Tumor's Life

Increased tumor cell sialylation caused by differential
expression of endogenous sialidases has been put forward as
a third mechanism. Sialidases can enzymatically cleave sialic
acids from glycans and thereby regulate shedding, plasticity,
and degradation of sialoglycans. At present, four human sialidases have been identiﬁed, located in the lysosome (NEU1, 4),
cytosol (NEU2), or plasma membrane (NEU3). Expression of
NEU1, 2, and 4 has been reported to be decreased in malignancies, leading to accumulation of sialoglycans in cancer cells.
Interestingly, NEU3 is found to be upregulated in some cancer
cell types, but the functional consequences on sialylation are
not yet understood (15).
Although the molecular mechanisms responsible for hypersialylation are starting to be unraveled, many questions
remain, for instance how sialic acid and sialoglycan synthesis
or hydrolysis rates relate to the function of individual glycoproteins and glycolipids in the cell membrane. Another unresolved issue is whether hypersialylation can have a causative
role in tumorigenesis or is a bystander effect of malignant
transformation. Overexpression of ST3Gal I in cancer cells has
been reported to be sufﬁcient to drive tumorigenesis in a
mouse model for breast cancer, and Swindall and colleagues
found indications that ST6Gal I upregulation is associated with
cancer stem cell maintenance (16, 17). These ﬁndings at least
suggest that sialyltransferase overexpression may have a signiﬁcant role in promoting tumorigenesis.

Sialic Acids and Apoptosis Evasion in Cancer
Resisting cell death is one hallmark of cancer cells (18).
Mutations or downregulation of molecules involved in the Fas
receptor–Fas ligand (FasR–FasL) apoptotic pathway are wellknown mechanisms exploited by cancer cells to escape apoptosis. Swindall and Bellis discovered a novel strategy whereby
tumor cells escape from Fas-mediated apoptosis: Hypersialylation of the Fas receptor was shown to disable apoptosis
induction in cancer cells (19). They identiﬁed FasR, which
serves as a substrate for ST6Gal I. Silencing expression of
ST6Gal I in cancer cells enhanced Fas ligand–induced apoptosis, whereas overexpression of ST6Gal I hindered Fasmediated apoptosis. Detailed analysis revealed that a2,6-sialylation of the FasR prevents the initiation of the deathinducing signaling complex (DISC) by hindering the binding
of the Fas-associated adaptor molecule FADD to the FasR
death domain. In addition, it was shown that a2,6-sialylation
impaired internalization of the Fas receptor. Normally, internalization of FasR leads to further DISC complex formation
and acts as a positive feedback loop for Fas-mediated apoptosis (20). Sialylation of FasR prevented this signal ampliﬁcation
loop and disrupted the downstream apoptotic signaling cascade, allowing tumor cells to disable a major mechanism of
apoptosis.
Next to Fas-mediated apoptosis, hypersialylation has been
reported to mediate resistance to anoikis, a cell death process
triggered when cells detach from adjacent cells or the ECM
(21). Amano and colleagues and Sanchez-Ruderisch and colleagues suggested an on/off switch model in which sialylation
of the ﬁbronectin receptor a5b1-integrin controls galectin-1–
mediated anoikis (22, 23). In this model, galectin-1 binds a5b1-

integrin following detachment from ﬁbronectin and triggers
proapoptotic signals leading to caspase-8 activation and subsequent cell death. a2,6-hypersialylation of a5b1-integrin prevented its binding to galectin-1 and the subsequent induction
of anoikis. These ﬁndings support the concept that a2,6–linked
sialic acids generally prevent binding of galectins to cellsurface glycans and inhibit galectin signaling (24). Interestingly, in these studies, a correlation was observed between the
anoikis-inducing tumor suppressor p16INK4a and expression of
genes involved in sialic acid synthesis. p16INK4a selectively
upregulates expression of both a5b1-integrin and galectin-1
and reduces a2,6 sialylation by downregulation of two ratelimiting enzymes in sialic acid biosynthesis, UDP-GlcNAc-2epimerase/ManAc kinase (GNE) and sialic acid synthase
(NANS; refs. 22, 25). In line with these ﬁndings, GNE overexpression has been shown to counteract p16INK4a-induced
anoikis, most likely via increasing the metabolic ﬂux through
the sialic acid pathway (22, 26).

Sialic Acids and Cancer Progression and
Metastasis
Elevated expression of sialoglycans correlates with tumor
aggressiveness and their capacity to metastasize and invade
surrounding tissue, and therefore correlates with a poor prognosis for patients with cancer (27). Cell biologic aspects of high
sialoglycan expression on cell adhesion and motility are well
documented and have been extensively reviewed elsewhere
(28). Much less is known about the molecular changes during
tumor progression that lead to high expression of sialoglycans
and a metastatic phenotype. Recent insights reveal that the
changes that occur during epithelial–mesenchymal transition
(EMT) are associated with altered expression of sialoglycans.
EMT is essential for tumor progression and is a prerequisite for
cancer cells to invade surrounding tissues and to metastasize.
EGF-induced EMT in colon cancer cells resulted in high
expression of the sialoglycans sialyl Lewis x (sLex) and sialyl
Lewis a (sLea) due to increased expression of ST3Gal I, III, IV
(11). SLex/a are both ligands for selectins expressed on endothelial cells that allow adherence to blood vessels, facilitate
extravasation into surrounding tissue, and trigger angiogenesis.
Indeed, high sLex/a expression correlates with tumor aggressiveness and patient survival (29). In another comprehensive
study, Maupin and colleagues analyzed gene expression in a
model of TGF-b–induced EMT. Here, EMT induction caused
upregulation of the enzymes ST3Gal II, ST6GalNAc IV, and
ST8Sia IV, which are involved in the synthesis of the adhesion
molecules GD1a and PSA (30). These studies indicate that the
upregulation of sialyltransferases and subsequent expression of
sialoglycans during EMT represent an important step underlying the migratory phenotype of metastasizing cancer cells.
Further support for the importance of sialic acids in cancer
metastasis comes from the scant information that is available
about the contribution of sialidases to tumor migration and
metastasis. Generally it is believed that downregulation of
sialidases in cancer increases their metastatic ability. For
example, downregulation of the lysosomal sialidases NEU1
and NEU4 favors tumor metastasis through hypersialylation
and enhanced signaling of the laminin receptor b4-integrin or

reduced hydrolysis of sLex antigens, respectively (31, 32).
Additional work is necessary to understand the individual and
combined contribution of sialyltransferases and sialidases in
cancer cell motility, tissue invasion, and metastasis formation.

Sialic Acids and Resistance to Cancer Therapy
Tumor cell resistance to chemotherapeutics or radiotherapy
forms a major barrier toward effective cancer therapy. Recently, several groups provided evidence that aberrant sialylation
and especially overexpression of ST6Gal I contribute to therapy
resistance in cancer. Schultz and colleagues reported that
overexpression of ST6Gal I confers resistance to cisplatin, a
platinum-based chemotherapeutic drug frequently used in the
clinics. They showed that ST6Gal I knockout sensitizes cancer
cells to cisplatin treatment, while overexpression confers
resistance. Moreover, they demonstrated that ST6Gal I is
highly expressed in cisplatin-resistant cells compared with
nonresistant cells (33). However, the effects on a2,6-sialylation of surface sialoglycans, for example, FasR, need to be
determined. Lately, this group also indicated that expression
of ST6Gal I regulates cancer stem cell resistance to chemotherapy with irinocetan (17). Importantly, the sialidase NEU3
has recently been found to mediate resistance to the topoisomerase inhibitor etoposide, potentially by affecting surface expression of b1-integrins and increased FAK/AKT
signaling (34).
Other than chemotherapy, Lee and colleagues reported that
radiotherapy induces high ST6Gal I expression in both cancer
cells and healthy tissue. Radiation of cancer cells increased
a2,6-sialylation of b1-integrins and could be linked to
increased cell adhesion and migration. As is the case with
cisplatin resistance, ST6Gal I expression mediated resistance
to radiation-induced cell death, but could be reversed upon
knockout of ST6Gal I or expression of the plasma sialidase
NEU2. Irradiation induced the expression of other sialyltransferases (ST3Gal I-IV, ST8Sia I) as well (35, 36). However, their
role in radiation resistance remains to be investigated. Together, the data available so far provide preliminary evidence that
altered sialyltransferase and possibly sialidase expression, and
hypersialylation of cancer cells can modulate the efﬁcacy of
anticancer drugs and confer resistance to chemo- and radiation therapy. These intriguing ﬁndings imply that it may be
highly rewarding to study the role of sialic acids in cancer
therapy resistance further.

Sialic Acids as Targets for Cancer Therapy
In the late 1960s, several groups reported that high expression of sialic acids on tumors favors tumor growth and
therefore deﬁned sialic acids as a potential therapeutic target
for cancer. Consequently, bacterial sialidases that remove
surface sialic acids were utilized for cancer therapy and
sialidase-treated tumor cells were used to therapeutically
vaccinate patients with cancer in clinical trials, although with
limited success (37). For several decades, bacterial sialidases
constituted the only robust approach to remove sialic acids
from cells, and they are still widely used in research. However,
the fact that tumor cells can rapidly replenish sialic acid

3202

expression on their cell surface following enzymatic removal
severely limits the usage of sialidases for cancer therapy (38).
Today, advances in glycobiology and carbohydrate chemistry have boosted the development of novel strategies to target
aberrant sialylation in cancer. Current strategies include speciﬁc or global inhibition of sialyltransferases and other
enzymes involved in sialic acid biosynthesis (e.g., GNE), overexpression and selective inhibition of sialidases, incorporation
of unnatural (antigenic) sialic acid analogues into sialoglycans,
and delivery of drugs to tumors using sialic acid-recognizing
antibodies or newly developed phenylboronic acid-installed
polymeric micelles (39–42). Experimentally, some approaches
have already produced promising results in vitro or in tumor
mouse models. Our group has recently evaluated the therapeutic potential of a novel sialyltransferase inhibitor, P-3FaxNeu5Ac, that was developed by Rillahan and colleagues (43).
P-3Fax-Neu5Ac is a ﬂuorinated sialic acid analogue that globally inhibits sialyltransferases and prevents the de novo synthesis of sialoglycans with high potency. P-3Fax-Neu5Ac treatment is signiﬁcantly more effective in prolonged reduction of
surface expression of sialic acids on tumor cells when compared with bacterial sialidases. Moreover, in agreement with
the proposed consequences of aberrant sialylation for tumor
growth, we were able to demonstrate that blockage of sialylation with P-3Fax-Neu5Ac strongly hinders tumor cell adhesion
to ECM ligands and migration in vitro and tumor engraftment
in a mouse model in vivo (38). Accordingly, Chen and colleagues reported that another sialyltransferase inhibitor, Lith-OAsp, attenuates spontaneous metastasis formation in a mouse
breast cancer model (44). These examples compellingly suggest that the recent approaches to selectively block aberrant
sialylation in cancer have the potential to counteract tumor
growth and metastasis formation and should be further
explored for anticancer therapy.

Conclusions and Future Directions
Sialic acids promote tumorigenesis and enhance tumor
progression at multiple levels by facilitating escape from
apoptosis, formation of metastasis, and resistance to therapy.
Selective approaches interfering with sialic acid expression
would therefore affect multiple different key processes in
cancer cells simultaneously and hold great promise for cancer
treatment. For a long time, only a few compounds interfering
with sialic acids were available and data from preclinical trials
have been limited. Recently, novel sialyltransferase inhibitors
have been developed that show speciﬁc and potent blockade of
the aberrant sialylation of tumor cells. Moreover, the potential
of this new class of inhibitors is emphasized by their ability to
antagonize tumor growth and metastasis formation in mouse
tumor models. These ﬁndings will not only stimulate further
basic research into the mechanisms and consequences of
aberrant sialylation in cancer, but should also boost further
studies on the therapeutic window of opportunities to apply
these inhibitors in (pre)clinical models for cancer therapy. It
may turn out to be highly rewarding to evaluate the therapeutic
potential of these inhibitors for clinical application, either as
stand-alone treatment or in combination with other cancer
treatment modalities.
