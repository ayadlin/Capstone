Abstract

Author Manuscript

ROCK1 and ROCK2 mediate important processes such as cell migration, invasion and metastasis;
making them good targets for the development of antitumor agents. Recently, using a fragmentbased approach and X-ray crystallography, we reported on the design and synthesis of novel Rhokinase inhibitors (RKIs). Here, we selected a pair of RKIs, the closely-related structural analogues
RKI-18 (potent; IC50 values of 397 nM (ROCK1) and 349 nM (ROCK2)) and RKI-11 (weak/
inactive; IC50 values of 38 µM (ROCK1) and 45 µM (ROCK2), as chemical probes and
determined their effects on cytoskeleton organization, signaling, apoptosis, anchorage-dependent
and –independent growth, migration and invasion. RKI-18 but not RKI-11 suppresses potently the
phosphorylation of the ROCK substrate MLC2 in intact human breast, lung, colon and prostate
cancer cells. Furthermore, RKI-18 is highly selective at decreasing the levels of P-MLC2 over
those of P-Akt, P-S6 and P-Erk ½. RKI-18 suppresses ROCK-mediated actin fiber formation
following stimulation with LPA as well as PAK-mediated lamelipodia and filopodia formation
following bradykinin or PDGF stimulation. Furthermore, RKI-18 but not RKI-11 inhibits
migration, invasion and anchorage-independent growth of human breast cancer cells. The fact that
the active ROCK inhibitor RKI-18 but not the inactive closely related structural analogue RKI-11
is effective at suppressing malignant transformation suggests that inhibition of ROCK with
RKI-18 results in preventing migration, invasion and anchorage-independent growth. The
potential of this class of RKIs as anti tumor agents warrants further advanced preclinical studies.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The Rho associated kinases 1 and 2 (ROCK1 and ROCK2) are Ser/Thr kinases that regulate
important cellular processes such as cell morphology, shape, adhesion and migration (1–7).
A major mechanism by which ROCKs affect these processes is through the phosphorylation
of myosin light chain (MLC), the MLC phosphatase PP1 regulatory subunit MYPT-1 and
Lim kinase, all of which regulate actin-myosin contractility. Phosphorylation of MLC
activates it to induce cell migration (7, 8) whereas phosphorylation of MYPT-1 inhibits dephosphorylation of MLC (6). Furthermore, phosphorylation of Lim Kinase activates it to
phosphorylate and inactivate cofilin which is known to suppress migration (9). The
involvement of ROCKs in malignant transformation has been well studied. For example,
ROCKs are over expressed in cancer cells relative to normal cells, and this over expression
is associated with metastasis, poor clinical outcome and shorter survival of cancer patients
(10, 11). Furthermore, depletion of ROCKs inhibits invasion and metastasis of cancer in
vitro and in vivo (10, 12–17). In contrast, forced expression induces migration and invasion
(14, 18, 19). Further evidence for the involvement of ROCKs comes from the fact that Rho
GTPases such as RhoA and RhoC are the immediate activators of ROCKs and their over
expression induces whereas their depletion inhibits migration, invasion and metastasis (20,
21). Furthermore, Rho GTPases have been shown to be overexpressed in a variety of cancer
types (22–27), and at least one of these, RhoC, has been suggested as a prognostic
biomarker for metastasis in breast, melanoma and pancreatic cancer (21, 26, 27). The
overwhelming data supporting the contributions of ROCKs and their affecters Rho GTPases
in metastasis prompted us and others to investigate the possibility of identifying ROCK
inhibitors as potential anti tumor agents. In this report we describe the ability of novel
ROCK inhibitors that we have recently identified (28) to suppress anchorage-independent
growth, migration and invasion of cancer cells. We also describe the ability of the ROCK
inhibitors to suppress cytoskeletal and cell morphological changes that are associated with
migration and invasion.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Identification of a pair of closely-related structural analogues RKI-18 (potent) and RKI-11
(weak/inactive) ROCK inhibitors

Author Manuscript

Our recent chemistry efforts using fragment-based drug design coupled with X-ray
crystallography resulted in the identification of potent Rho Kinase Inhibitors (RKIs) (28). In
an effort to investigate the effects of these inhibitors on signaling, anchorage-dependent and
-independent tumor cell growth, apoptosis, migration and invasion we selected a pair of
closely-related analogues, one potent and the other weak/inactive RKI. RKI-18 and RKI-11
are structurally very close indazole urea-based analogues where in RKI-18 the indazole urea
and the phenyl group are linked by the two carbon ethylene, whereas in RKI-11 they are
attached directly without a linker (Figure 1A). Figure 1B shows that RKI-18 and RKI-11
inhibited ROCK1 with IC50 values of 397 nM and 38 µM. Figure 1B also shows that
RKI-18 and RKI-11 inhibited ROCK2 with IC50 values of 349 nM and 45 µM, respectively.
Thus, RKI-18 was 96- to 129-fold more potent than RKI-11, providing an ideal pair of

malignant transformation.
RKI-18 but not RKI-11 inhibits phosphorylation of the ROCK substrate MLC-2 selectively
over the phosphorylation of Akt, Erk and S6 kinases in human cancer cells

Author Manuscript

In order to determine the activity of the ROCK inhibitors in intact human cancer cells,
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were treated with various concentrations of RKI-11,
RKI-18, or vehicle, and their ability to inhibit the phosphorylation of MLC-2 at ser19, a
well-known substrate of ROCK was assessed by western blotting as described under
Materials and Methods. Figure 2A shows that RKI-18 suppressed phospho MLC-2 levels at
concentration as low as 1 µM whereas RKI-11, consistent with its weak in vitro activity, had
no effect at concentrations as high as 30 µM. RKI-18 also inhibited the phosphorylation of
MEK at Ser298, a site known to be phosphorylated by p21-activated kinase (PAK) (29) but
RKI-18 was more potent towards inhibiting P-MLC2 than P-Mek. In contrast, RKI-18 had
little effects on phospho Ser-240/244-S6 (mTORC1 substrate) (Figure 2A). To determine
whether RKI-18 can inhibit the phosphorylation of MLC-2 in other human cancer cell lines,
we treated 3 breast (MCF-7, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-231), 2 lung (A549 and H460),
2 colon (HT29 and HCT116) and one prostate (DU145) cancer cell lines with either vehicle
or RKI-18 and processed the cells for Western blotting as described under Materials and
Methods. Figure 2 B shows that in all 8 cell lines RKI-18 inhibited the phosphorylation
levels of MLC-2. RKI-18 was highly selective for P-MLC-2 over P-S240/244-S6 (mTORC1
substrate), P-S473-Akt (mTORC2 substrate) and P-Erk ½ (Mek substrate) (Figure 2B).
Taken together these results demonstrate that RKI-18 is highly selective for ROCK over
other kinases such as mTORC1, mTORC2 and Mek. Finally, consistent with the in vitro
kinase activity assay results, RKI-18 was much more potent than RKI-11 in intact cells.

RKI 18 but not RKI-11 inhibits LPA-, Bradykinin- and PDGF-induced stress fiber formation,
filopodia and lamelipodia, respectively

Author Manuscript

Stress fiber formation upon stimulation with LPA (Lysophosphatidic Acid) is a cytoskeleton
re-organization process mediated by the activation of RhoA/ROCK pathway whereas PDGF
stimulation of lamelipodia formation is mediated by the RAC1/PAK pathway and
Bradykinin stimulation of filopodia (spikes) formation is mediated by the CDC42/PAK
pathway (30). To determine the effects of our RKIs on these morphological changes, we
starved NIH 3T3 cells and treated them with either RKI-11, RKI-18 or vehicle prior to
stimulating them with either LPA, PDGF or bradykinin, and then staining the cells with
phalloidin as described under Materials and Methods. Figure 3 shows that RKI-18 but not
RKI-11 inhibited LPA-induced stress fiber formation, bradykinin-induced filopodia
formation and PDGF-induced lamelipodia formation (Figure 3). The ability of RKI-18 to
inhibit the formation of actin stress fiber, filopodia and lamelipodia, cytoskeletal changes
that are critical to cell motility, suggests that this inhibitor may interfere with the ability of
cancer cells to migrate and invade.

RKI-18 but not RKI-11 inhibits anchorage-independent growth, migration and invasion of
human breast cancer cells

Author Manuscript

The ability of cancer cells to metastasize depends on their ability to grow in an anchorageindependent manner, migrate and invade. We, therefore, investigated the effects of RKI-18
and RKI-11 to affect these cancer hallmarks. To this end, we first determined the ability of
these compounds to inhibit anchorage-independent growth in Soft Agar assay as described
under Materials and Methods. The results from Figures 4A and 4B demonstrate that RKI-18
inhibited soft agar colony formation of MDA-MB-231 cells with an IC50 of 8 µM whereas
the closely related analog and less active ROCK inhibitor RKI-11 had little effect at 60 µM
on anchorage-independent growth. To determine the effects of RKI-18 and RKI-11 on
anchorage-dependent proliferation and survival, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of the inhibitors and processed for MTT assays as well as Western
blotting as described under Materials and Methods. Figure 4C shows that RKI-18 was 4-fold
less potent at inhibiting anchorage-dependent proliferation (IC50 = 32 µM) as compared to
anchorage-independent growth (IC50 = 8 µM). Furthermore, RKI-18 treatment (up to 30
µM) of these cells did not induce apoptosis as measured by caspase 3 activation and PARP
cleavage (data not shown). These results suggest that the ability of RKI-18 to inhibit the
anchorage-independent growth of cancer cell on soft agar is not due to inhibition of
anchorage-dependent proliferation and/or induction of apoptosis.

Author Manuscript

We next determined the ability of these compounds to inhibit migration of breast cancer
cells in a wound healing scratch assay as described under Materials and Methods. RKI-18
inhibited the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells in a concentration dependent manner starting
at 3 µM (Figure 5A). In contrast, RKI-11 at 60 µM did not inhibit the migration of these
cells (Figure 5A). The ability of cancer cells to metastasize depends on their ability to
invade; we therefore investigated the ability of RKIs to inhibit invasion as described under
Materials and Methods. Figure 5B shows that RKI-18 at 10 µM inhibited the cancer cells
from invading through Matrigel by 67% whereas RKI-11 had no effect on cell invasion at 60
µM.

Author Manuscript

In summary, this manuscript describes the anti-migratory and anti-invasive activities of
novel ROCK inhibitors as well as their ability to suppress anchorage-independent tumor cell
growth and to inhibit cytoskeletal changes associated with migration and invasion. We chose
two pairs of inhibitors consisting of potent and weak/inactive RKIs to be able to demonstrate
a correlation between inhibition of the biochemical target and the modulation of the
biological phenotypes and cancer hallmarks. RKI-18 and RKI-11 differ by only a two
carbon linker, yet RKI-18 is 96- and 129-fold more potent towards ROCK1 and ROCK2,
respectively. This was respected in intact breast cancer cells where RKI-18 suppressed the
phosphorylation of the ROCK substrate MLC2 whereas RKI-11 had little effect.
Importantly, RKI-18 but not RKI-11 inhibited migration, invasion and anchorageindependent growth. The tight correlation between inhibition of ROCK in vitro, inhibition of
P-MLC2 levels and suppression of migration, invasion and anchorage-independent tumor
cell growth suggest that the ability of RKI-18 to suppress these cancer hallmarks is at least
in part due to their ability to inhibit ROCK. RKI-18 inhibited the phosphorylation of MCL2
selectively over the phosphorylation of Akt, Erk 1/2 and S6 suggesting that this inhibitor is

not promiscuous. However, RKI-18 also inhibited, although to a lesser extent, the
phosphorylation of Ser-298-Mek suggesting that they also inhibit PAK. Consistent with this
is the fact that RKI-18 inhibited not only the Rho-ROCK-dependent LPA stimulation of
stress fiber formation but also the Rac/PAK-dependent bradykinin stimulation of filopodia
formation as well as the CDC42/PAK-mediated PDGF-stimulation of lamellipodia
formation. Therefore, the ability of RKI-18 to inhibit migration, invasion and anchorageindependent tumor cell growth may also be mediated at least in part by inhibition of PAK.
Inhibition of PAK is desirable since this is a well validated cancer drug discovery target. It is
interesting to note here that we have recently reported on another ROCK inhibitor,
RKI-1447, with a different pharmacophore than RKI-18 and that was highly selective in its
effects on cytoskeletal organization (31). Indeed RKI-1447 inhibited LPA- but not
Bradykinin- or PDGF-induced cytoskeletal changes. Consistent with this, RKI-1447 did not
inhibit the phosphorylation of S298 on Mek (31). Finally, RKI-18 did not induce apoptosis
and inhibited anchorage-dependent proliferation at concentrations that are much higher than
those needed to inhibit anchorage-independent growth, migration and invasion. This
suggests that the ability of RKI-18 to inhibit anchorage-independent growth, migration and
invasion is not due to inhibition of proliferation and/or induction of apoptosis. This is
consistent with a mechanism involving inhibition of ROCKs, kinases known to be involved
in migration and invasion and not proliferation and survival (6, 32).

MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in a 12 well tissue culture plate at 1200 cells per well in
regular growth media and 0.3% agar as described by us (33). The cells were treated with
different doses of RKI-11and RKI-18, allowed to grow for 4 weeks after which the colonies
were stained overnight with 1mg/ml MTT and counted as described by us (33).
MTT assay

Author Manuscript

MTT assay was performed to determine the effects of RKIs on anchorage-dependent cell
proliferation. Briefly, cells were plated in a 96 well tissue culture plate (1200 cells per well)
and incubated for 24 hours. After incubation the cells were treated with vehicle or increasing
concentrations of RKI-11 or RKI-18 (0.05 -50 µM). After 72 hour incubation, freshly
prepared MTT (2mg/ml) was added to each well and incubated for 3 hours. After incubation
the plates were read at 540nm.
Wound healing-Migration assay
MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded at 4X105 cells per well in a 6-well plate and allowed to
grow overnight at 37 degree C and 5% CO2. The cells were starved for 24 hours and
scratched. The cells were then treated with different concentrations of RKIs in regular
growth media for 24 hours. Images of the scratch were acquired at 0 hours and 24 hours.
Invasion assay

Author Manuscript

Invasion assay was performed in Corning Transwell inserts coated with Matrigel. MDAMB-231 cells were seeded at 3.5X105 and allowed to grow overnight in a 6well-plate. The
cells were treated with either vehicle or different doses of RKIs for 24 hours. After
treatment, the cells were trypsinized, resuspended and plated in the inserts as described by
us previously (31). The bottom chamber contained 20% FBS as the “chemoattractant”. The
cells were kept in the incubator for 48 hours. After incubation the cells were stained and
membrane was quantified exactly the same way as described by us previously (31).

Figure 2. RKI-18 but not RKI-11 inhibits the phosphorylation of ROCK substrate MLC-2 in
human cancer cells of different origins

A. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with different concentrations of RKI-11or RKI-18 and
processed for western immunoblotting as described under Materials and Methods. B. MDAMB-468, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, DU-145, H460, A549, HT29 and HCT116 cells were
treated with either vehicle (V) or 3 µM RKI-18 (RKI) and processed for western
immunoblotting as described under Material and Methods. Data are representative of three
(A) and one (B) independent experiments.
