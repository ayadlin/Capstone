BACKGROUND. The human embryonic lethal abnormal vision (ELAV)-like protein
HuR is a messenger RNA (mRNA)-binding protein that controls the stability of
certain transcripts, including cyclooxygenase2 (COX-2).

METHODS. To investigate a possible contribution of dysregulation of mRNA stability to the progression of cancer and to COX-2 over expression in mesothelioma,
the authors studied expression of COX-2 and HuR in 5 mesothelioma cell lines
(MSTO, NCI, Ist-Mes1, Ist-Mes2, and MPP89) and in a group of 29 human
mesothelioma specimens that were characterized previously for COX-2 expression.

RESULTS. All 5 cell lines expressed HuR, whereas COX-2 was not detectable in

CONCLUSIONS. The current results suggested that HuR plays a role in tumor progression in mesothelioma and that COX-2 may be a target of its activity in neoplastic cells. Together, these observations indicate that strategies aiming toward
the modulation of HuR may have a potential clinical benefit in mesothelioma.

here is considerable evidence that arachidonic acid metabolites,
particularly prostaglandins, participate both in normal growth
responses and in aberrant growth, including carcinogenesis.1 Cyclooxygenase (COX) plays a role in the conversion of arachidonic
acid to several metabolites with the isoform COX-2, leading to preferential formation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2). COX-2 has been
implicated in tumor proliferation, increased angiogenesis, tumor
invasiveness, and decreased cell-mediated immunity.2-6 Physiologically, COX-2 expression is regulated tightly and is highly inducible
by inflammatory stimuli.7 In many malignant tumors, an increased
expression of COX-2 has been described and is related to poor prognosis. Over expression of the inducible isoform COX-2 occurs in malignant mesothelioma (MM), and a connection between COX-2

expression and human MM has been established
with the demonstration that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs specific for COX-2 have antiproliferative effects.8 Several studies examined COX-2
levels in resected MM specimens and correlated
levels of COX-2 with clinicopathologic prognostic
factors and determined that high COX-2 expression
was correlated with poor survival.9,10
The development of MM is associated in most
patients with a history of asbestos exposure.11
Research has demonstrated that asbestos exposure
generates reactive oxygen species and activates macrophages and other cell types to produce these compounds as well as cytokines and growth factors.12
Furthermore, the deposition of insoluble amphibole
fibers results in a chronic inflammatory state in
exposed individuals.13 Even if it has been proposed
that alteration of the cell cycle-regulatory proteins
could play a role in the progression of this deadly
disease,14,15 the exact mechanism by which asbestos
induces MM still has not been characterized completely.16 The existence of inflammation has been associated with up-regulation of the inducible COX-217
and is associated with an increased risk of cancer.18
Molecular events leading to over expression of the
COX-2 protein in MM have not been characterized
definitively.
Regulation of gene expression by post-transcriptional modification of messenger RNA (mRNA) stability and translation is an important mechanism
used in the adaptation of cells during inflammatory
responses as well as in the control of cellular
growth.19 AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 30 -untranslated region (30 UTR) of some mRNAs are involved in
regulating the degradation of mRNAs and provide an
effective way to control protein expression by regulating mRNA half-life as well as translation. An ARE
has been identified within the 30 UTR of COX-2
mRNA that confers post-transcriptional regulation of
expression by controlling both mRNA decay and
mRNA protein translation.20,21 A group of proteins
capable of binding to AREs to control mRNA stability
has been identified. Among these proteins, the
human family of human embryonic lethal abnormal
vision (ELAV)-like proteins consists of 4 members
(Hel-N1/HuB, HuC, HuD, and HuR) that are involved
in post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA turnover
and mRNA stability.22 These human proteins are
highly conserved and show homology to the Drosophila nuclear protein ELAV. Three of these proteins
(Hel-N1/HuB, HuC, and HuD) are expressed mainly
in neuronal tissue. In contrast, the fourth protein,
HuR, is expressed in many cell types and stabilizes
cellular mRNAs that contain AREs in their 30 UTR.

Several studies have demonstrated that HuR binds to
the COX-2 adenine- and uridine-rich element and
stabilizes COX-2 mRNA, leading to increased expression of COX-2 protein.23-26 In cancer cells, it was
demonstrated previously that altered post-transcriptional regulation of COX-2 is mediated by increased
cytoplasmic mRNA binding of the mRNA stability
factor HuR.23 Under normal conditions, HuR is localized primarily in the nucleus. However, in response
to cellular signaling, HuR is translocated rapidly to
the cytoplasm, where it influences mRNA stabilization and translational efficiency.27 It is noteworthy
that the over expression of HuR in different cancer
types, and particularly in its subcellular localization,
recently was correlated with tumor aggressiveness.28,29 On the basis of this finding, we sought to
determine whether, in MM cells, changes in cytoplasmic trafficking of this factor could account for the
observed COX-2 mRNA stabilization and protein
expression promoted by cytokine mix. Drawing from
this background, we decided to investigate COX-2
and HuR expression in several MM cell lines and in a
group of well characterized human MM specimens.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Lines
The human MM cell lines MSTO-211H and NCIH2452 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Rockville, Md). Cells were
cultured as monolayers in flasks using ATCC complete growth medium in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% carbon dioxide at 378C. The human
MM cell lines Ist-Mes1, Ist-Mes2, and MPP89 were
obtained from Genova Institute Culture Collection.
Ist-Mes1 and Ist-Mes2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium with piruvate supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
glutamine (2 mM), 1% nonessential amino acids, and
antibiotics (0.02 IU/mL-1 penicillin and 0.02 mg.mL1 streptomycin); and the established MM cell line,
MPP89, was maintained in Hamm F10 medium with
15% FBS, and supplemented with glutamine (2 mM)
and antibiotics (0.02 IU/mL-1 penicillin and 0.02
mg/mL-1 streptomycin) in a humidified atmosphere
that contained 5% carbon dioxide at 378C.
Cell Stimulation by Cytokine
Subconfluent MM cells were stimulated with cytomix
(14 ng/mL tumor necrosis factor alpha [Alexis Biochemical, Lausen, Switzerland], 1 ng/lL interleukin-1
beta [Alexis Biochemical], 27 ng/mL human interferon gamma [PBL Biochemical Laboratories, Piscataway, NJ], and 160 ng lipopolysaccharide [Alexis

HuR and COX-2 in Malignant Mesothelioma/Stoppoloni et al

Biochemical]) for 3 hours. Then, supernatant fluids
were harvested and frozen at 2808 for PGE-2 detection, and the cells were removed by trypsin and divided into 2 identical sides for protein and mRNA
extraction. Controls were treated in the same manner
without cytomix. Experiments in each MM cell line
were repeated 3 times.

Prostaglandin E2 Assay
PGE-2 levels were detected in medium from cell culture by using the Correlate-EIA high-sensitivity prostaglandin E2 enzyme immunoassay kit from Assay
Designs (Ann Arbor, Mich) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Each determination was made in
triplicate.
Protein Extraction
MM cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM
Tris [pH 8.0], 1% NP40, 10% glycerol, 137 mM NaCl,
10 mM ethylenediamine tetracetic acid [EDTA], and
inhibitor of protease) for 20 minutes followed by
centrifugation at 48C for 15 minutes. Cytoplasmic
lysates were obtained by resuspending cell pellets in
ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM N-[2-hydroxethyl] piperazine-NA-2-ethanesulfonic acid [HEPES]
[pH 7.9], 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol,
50 mM NaF, and 10 mM KCl) containing protease
inhibitors and incubating on ice for 10 minutes. Cells
were lysed by 3 passages through a 27-gauge needle,
and cytoplasmic extracts were separated from nuclei
by centrifugation at 14,000 revolutions per minute
(rpm) for 10 seconds. Nuclear lysates were obtained
by resuspending pellets in ice-cold lysis buffer (10
mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA,
25% glycerol, and 420 mM NaCl) containing protease
inhibitors and incubating on ice for 20 minutes. After
centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 5 minutes, the nuclear extracts were collected. Protein concentration
was measured using Bradford Protein Assay (Bio-Rad
Laboratories; Hercules, Calif).
Western Blot Analysis
Lysates were denatured and separated on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes
and probed with antibodies against COX-2 (COX-2
monoclonal antibody: Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor,
Mich), HuR (3A2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, Calif), monoclonal anti-g–tubulin and actin
(Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo). and antia–tubulin mouse antibody (Calbiochem, Darmstadt,
Germany). Goat antimouse immunoglobulin G horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies

2763

(Bio-Rad Laboratories) were used. Then, the blots
were reacted with ECL Western blotting detection
reagents (Amersham Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Ovine
COX-2 standard (Cayman Chemical) was used as a
positive control. The expression of COX-2 was
assayed in 80 lg of total lysates, and HuR was
detected in 10 lg of total, cytoplasmic, and nuclear
lysates. The appropriate separation of cytoplasmic
and nuclear fraction was demonstrated by labeling
for a-tubulin.

Extraction of Total RNA and Reverse Transcription
Total RNA was prepared from cultured MSTO-211H,
NCI-H2452, Ist-Mes1, Ist-Mes2, and MPP89 cells
using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies,
Paisley, UK) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Reverse transcription of RNA for first-strand
combinational DNA (cDNA) synthesis was performed
using 4 lg total RNA, 0.5 lg oligo(dT)12-18 primer
(Invitrogen Life Technologies), and 10 mM dinucleotide triphosphate mix in a final volume of 12 lL. The
reaction was incubated at 708C for 10 minutes and
immediately chilled on ice. Primer extension was
then performed 10 minutes at temperature room and
at 428C for 2 minutes after addition of First-Strand
Buffer, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 40 U RNase OUT
Recombinant Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Invitrogen Life
Technologies) in a final volume of 19 lL. Next, 1 lL
(200 U) SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen Life Technologies) was added, and the mixture
was incubated at 428C for 50 minutes. Finally, the
reaction was inactivated by heating at 708C for
10 minutes, and cDNA was stored at 2208C.
Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction Analysis
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis
was conducted in a volume of 25 lL containing
40 ng cDNA (1:100 dilution of reverse transcriptase
mixture), 1.25 lL COX-2 primer, and 12.5 lL TaqMan
Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif) in the following sequence: 2 minutes
at 508C, denaturation for 10 minutes at 958C followed
by 40 cycles of the amplification step at 958 for 15
seconds (denaturation), and then at 608C for 60 seconds (annealing/extension) in 96-well plates with
the ABI PRISM 7000 sequence Detection System
(Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR for the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH) was carried out under the same
conditions using a GADPH Assay on Demand
(Applied Biosystems). A standard curve for the COX2 gene was constructed using serial dilutions (200
ng, 40 ng, 8 ng, and 1.6 ng) of a pool of cDNA from

2764

the cell lines MSTO, NCI, Ist-Mes1, Ist-Mes2, and
MPP89. Results were analyzed using the Applied Biosystems analysis software, and expression levels were
calculated from a linear regression analysis of the
standard curve. Results are given as COX-2 expression
versus GADPH expression (COX-2 relative expression)
to correct for differences in the quantity of cDNA
used in the PCR reaction. All real-time PCR reactions
for each sample were performed in triplicate.

Clinical Data and Tumor Specimen Acquisition
All patients were treated at the Second University of
Naples between 1980 and 1996. Clinical data were
obtained by retrospective chart review. Survival was
determined from the date of initial surgery. Indeed,
surgery/biopsy was the first step in diagnosis for all
patients. Consequently, surgery/biopsy and diagnosis
overlapped. Follow-up was available for all patients.
Two patients who died of causes other than mesothelioma during follow-up were excluded from the study.
All patients underwent at least cytoreductive surgery,
and 13 patients also received radiotherapy or chemotherapy. A clear history of asbestos exposure was
reported only for 3 patients. This does not mean that
all other patients were not exposed to asbestos. In
fact, all patients were living in Campania, an Italian
region where, unfortunately, asbestos contamination
is very high. Tissues from 29 MM specimens (16
epithelioid, 6 sarcomatoid, and 7 mixed mesotheliomas) that were obtained from open biopsies or pleurectomies were collected and fixed in 10% formalin
before they were embedded in paraffin.
Histology
The formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples were
sectioned at 5 lm and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin. The histologic diagnosis was reexamined by a
pathologist (A.B.) according to the 1981 World Health
Organization criteria. In addition, the most representative blocks were selected to be cut into new 5-lmthick sections for immunohistochemical studies.
Immunohistochemistry
All 29 tumors were assessed by immunohistochemistry for the presence of HuR. Sections from each specimen were cut at 5 lm, mounted on glass, and dried
overnight at 378C. All sections were then deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated through a graded alcohol
series, and washed in phosphate-buffered saline,
which was used for all subsequent washes and for
antibody dilution. Endogenous peroxidase activity
was blocked by 5% hydrogen peroxide. The mouse
monoclonal antibody for HuR (3A2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) was applied at 48C for 12 hours at

levels of COX2 and HuR were assessed by Western blot analysis. Actin
(ACTINA) was used as a loading control.

1:1000 dilution after antigen retrieval in citrate buffer
in a pressure cooker for 5 minutes. The optimal
working dilution was defined on the basis of titration
experiments. Then, the sections were immunostained
with the streptavidin-biotin system (Dako, Carpenteria, Calif) using diaminobenzidine as the final
chromogen and hematoxylin as the nuclear counterstain. Negative controls for each tissue section were
prepared by leaving out the primary antibody. A suitable positive control was run with each set of slides.
All samples were processed under the same conditions. The expression of HuR was evaluated as
absent, nuclear, or nuclear and cytoplasmic. The experimental conditions for the immunohistochemical
analysis of COX-2, have been described elsewhere.10

Statistical Analysis
The Fisher exact test was used to assess the relation
between ordinal data (correlation matrix between
immunostaining parameters). A univariate overall
survival analysis was conducted for each prognostic
variable according to the Kaplan-Meier method.30
The terminal event was death attributable to cancer.
The statistical significance of the differences in survival distribution among the prognostic groups was
evaluated by the log-rank test.31 P values <.05 were
regarded as statistically significant in 2-tailed tests.
SPSS software (version 10.00; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill)
was used for statistical analysis.

analysis. HuR was expressed in all cell lines, whereas
COX-2 protein was detectable only in Ist-Mes1, IstMes2, and MPP89 cells. To analyze the effects of cytokine stimulation, all 5 cell lines were incubated for 3
hours with cytomix and the effect of stimulation was
evaluated by measuring the increased COX-2 mRNA in
the treated cells compared with the untreated cells.
Whereas, in MSTO, NCI, and Ist-Mes1 cells, no differences in COX-2 mRNA were observed; in MPP89 and
Ist-Mes2 cells, we observed increases of 5-fold (P 5
.0003) and 6-fold (P 5 .0001), respectively, compared
with COX-2 mRNA controls (Fig. 2A).

2765

Figure 2B shows that the increased expression of
COX-2 protein in MPP89 and Ist-Mes2 cells after stimulation with cytokines was accompanied by a clear
translocation of HuR protein from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm that was not associated with increased
expression of HuR protein in the total lysates. A different situation was observed in Ist-Mes1 cells,
which, after stimulation with cytokines, did not display an increase in COX-2, and this corresponded
with the failure of HuR to translocate from the
nucleus to the cytoplasm. In MSTO and NCI cells,
neither HuR translocation nor increased COX-2
expression was noted after stimulation with cytomix
compared with controls.
Finally, we evaluated COX-2 activity by determining PGE-2 expression in the same cells. Figure 2C
shows that the MPP89 and Ist-Mes2 cells incubated
with cytomix, respectively, produced 2-fold (P 5 .03)
and 1.5-fold (P 5 .01) more PGE-2 than controls. In
stimulated Ist-Mes1, MSTO, and NCI cells, we did
not observed any increase in COX-2 activity compared with controls. These results indicate that, in
cells that are sensitive to cytokine stimulation, the
expression of COX-2 increases only if there is translocation of HuR from the nucleus to the cytoplasm
and that this contributes to COX-2 mRNA stabilization and protein synthesis.

specimens included 16 epithelioid, 6 sarcomatoid, and
7 mixed mesotheliomas. HuR staining was either negative, or nuclear, or nuclear and cytoplasmic. Figure 3
presents some samples of typical immunohistochemical staining for HuR. COX-2 immunostaining always
was cytoplasmic, as previously reported elsewhere.10
By using a rank correlation matrix, a positive,
statistically significant correlation was recorded
between high COX-2 expression levels and cytoplasmic localization of HuR (P 5 .016). Conversely, no
correlation was recorded between immunohistochemical parameters and mesothelioma histology
type. These results are summarized in Table 2.
On univariate analysis, overall survival appeared
to be influenced by HuR expression. The median survival of patients who had absent or nuclear HuR
expression was longer than the median survival of
patients who had cytoplasmic HuR expression (P 5
.004). Indeed, when we statistically analyzed the immunohistochemical specimens by determining the

percentage of positive cells, we did not produce any
significant results, most likely because of the small
number of patients enrolled. The correlation between
high COX-2 expression and poor survival has been
described elsewhere.10 It is interesting to note that the
histologic tumor type did not influence overall survival in our patient population. These data are summarized in Table 3. Figure 4 depicts Kaplan-Meier
survival plots for all patients and demonstrates a statistically significant association between cytoplasmic
expression of HuR and poor outcome (P 5 .004). It is
important to note that chemotherapy and radiotherapy did not appear to have any impact on overall survival in univariate analysis, as depicted in Table 4.

DISCUSSION
MM is one of the most lethal human tumors, and its
incidence is expected to increase in Western countries within the next 20 years.32 The prognosis for
patients with MM is poor, and they have a median
survival of few months whether they are treated or
untreated.33,34 Recent randomized studies on the
treatment of mesothelioma with combined chemotherapy demonstrated a survival benefit when a combination of cisplatin and antifolate drugs was
used35,36 and when surgery was supplemented by
postoperative radiotherapy in patients who underwent incomplete resection.37 Unfortunately, none of
those forms of treatment had a significant impact on
the progression and outcome of mesothelioma, and
new therapeutic approaches must be investigated for
a more successful treatment of this disease.
In this scenario, the RNA-binding protein HuR
may represent a suitable candidate as an alternative
therapeutic strategy for this deadly neoplasm.
Indeed, mutated HuR has never been identified in
cancer, but it influences the expression of target
mRNAs that codify for genes fundamental in the acquisition of a tumor phenotype, such as the genes
involved in cell cycle and apoptosis regulation, in
angiogenesis and migration, and in evasion of
immune recognition.38 HuR is present predominantly
in the nucleus of unstimulated cells, but it can be
exported to the cytoplasm in response to a variety of
agents, notably, proliferative and stressful signals.27
Several stress-activated signaling pathways have been
reported that modulate the cytoplasmic abundance
of HuR and, thus, its RNA-binding function (for a
review of the literature, see Lopez de Silanes et al38).
It is noteworthy that HuR has been identified as
an RNA-binding protein that recognizes COX-2 AREs
and exerts effects on COX-2 expression by controlling
rapid mRNA decay and translational efficiency.23-26

abnormal vision-like protein HuR.

Because recent results indicate that COX-2 molecules
may be involved in the progression of mesothelioma
and may be potential targets for therapy,39-42 we
decided to investigate HuR and its regulation of
COX-2 in mesothelioma cells. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study investigating HuR in
mesothelioma. We observed that HuR was expressed
in all the 5 MM cell lines tested, whereas COX-2 was
detectable only in 3 of 5 cell lines. Cytokine treatment of these cells mobilized HuR from the nucleus
to the cytoplasm and produced consequent COX-2
mRNA stabilization and augmented protein expression. Our findings strongly argue for a role of HuR in
the stress-mediated stabilization of COX-2 mRNA. It

also is important to note that the greater mRNA
COX-2 levels in MPP89 cells (compared with protein
expression in the absence of stimulation with cytokines) suggest that COX2 mRNA in this cell line may
be regulated after transcription. After cytokine stimulation followed by HuR translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, the increased synthesis of
mRNA COX-2 leads to an increase in metabolically
active protein, as demonstrated by the levels of PGE2. Remarkably, the Ist-Mes1 cell line has very stable
mRNA, it is not subject to stimulation with cytokine
and protein expression of COX2, and its product
PGE-2 remain unchanged. Although the regulation of
mRNA stability appears to be the most important

have reported that other mechanisms, such as transcriptional control or hypermethylation,20 also are
involved in the regulation of COX-2 expression. We
believe that the finding that, in some MM cell
lines (MSTO, NCI and Ist-Mes1), there is a deteriorating increase in COX-2 expression after cytokine stimulation may be explained best by these additional
regulatory mechanisms for COX-2 expression. Nevertheless, there are several other potential mechanisms
for cytokines to affect COX-2 expression (such as
activation of nuclear factor-jB); therefore, the finding
of a correlation between HuR localization and COX-2
expression across cell lines will need further functional studies to support a mechanistic correlation.
To investigate whether these in vitro observations may have some clinical relevance, we decided
to analyze HuR expression in a group of samples
from patients with MM that already had been characterized for COX-2 expression.10 We observed that
HuR was expressed in the great majority of MM samples as a nuclear protein; moreover, in a group of
samples, we also detected cytoplasmic HuR expression. It is noteworthy that the cytoplasmic expression
of HuR was correlated significantly with high COX-2
expression and with poor survival. These observations strongly suggest that HuR plays a role in tumor
progression in MM and that COX-2 may be a target
of its activity in the neoplastic cells. It must be
noted, however, that the data described here are retrospective and essentially observational in nature;
therefore, they cannot explain the functional
mechanisms by which COX-2 actually promotes tumor growth. Therefore, additional studies performed
with larger, independent groups of patients are

needed to decipher the interactions between HuR,
and COX-2 expression in MM.
In conclusion, to our knowledge, this is the first
study of the relation between COX-2, HuR, and survival in patients with MM. The data obtained
strongly suggest that cytoplasmic expression of HuR
protein may be part of a regulatory pathway that
controls the mRNA stability of several biologically
important tumor targets and that, among these targets, COX-2 also could be considered. Therefore, we
propose that HuR may be a promising predictive
marker and a possible target for molecular tumor
therapy for patients with MM. Considering the finding that at least some COX-2 inhibitors have significant side effects related to cardiovascular toxicity,42,43
targeting HuR may be an important alternative therapeutic strategy for patients with MM who over
express COX-2. Further studies urgently are required
both at the molecular level and at the clinical level
to confirm these observations and eventually to propose HuR as a concrete target for MM therapy.
