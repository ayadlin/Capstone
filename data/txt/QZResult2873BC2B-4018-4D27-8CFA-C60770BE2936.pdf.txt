Abstract
Metabolic disruptions that occur widely in cancers offer an attractive focus for generalized treatment strategies.
The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) senses metabolic status and produces an essential substrate for
O-linked b-N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT), which glycosylates and thereby modulates the function of its
target proteins. Here, we report that the HBP is activated in prostate cancer cells and that OGT is a central regulator
of c-Myc stability in this setting. HBP genes were overexpressed in human prostate cancers and androgen regulated
in cultured human cancer cell lines. Immunohistochemical analysis of human specimens (n ¼ 1987) established
that OGT is upregulated at the protein level and that its expression correlates with high Gleason score, pT and pN
stages, and biochemical recurrence. RNA interference–mediated siliencing or pharmacologic inhibition of OGT
was sufﬁcient to decrease prostate cancer cell growth. Microarray proﬁling showed that the principal effects of OGT
inhibition in prostate cancer cells were related to cell-cycle progression and DNA replication. In particular, c-MYC
was identiﬁed as a candidate upstream regulator of OGT target genes and OGT inhibition elicited a dose-dependent
decrease in the levels of c-MYC protein but not c-MYC mRNA in cell lines. Supporting this relationship, expression
of c-MYC and OGT was tightly correlated in human prostate cancer samples (n ¼ 1306). Our ﬁndings identify HBP
as a modulator of prostate cancer growth and c-MYC as a key target of OGT function in prostate cancer cells. Cancer

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the second most common male cancer in
the world. The androgen receptor (AR) is a principal target
in prostate cancer research because AR activity is maintained
in castration-resistant disease, and both localized and
advanced diseases are responsive to drugs that alter hormonal
signaling (1). AR regulates anabolic metabolism and promotes
aerobic glycolysis (2, 3). Experiments carried out in cell lines
have led to the identiﬁcation of large metabolic networks and
the question remains whether there is an integration point of
these networks that is clinically relevant.
The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) requires glutamine, glucose, acetyl-Coenzyme-A, and nucleotide UTP to

synthesize UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc; ref. 4).
This pathway senses the availability of energy and couples
metabolic ﬂux to control cell proliferation (4–6). HBP provides
substrate for postranslational modiﬁcation of plasma membrane and secretory proteins. In addition, UDP-GlcNAc is used
by O-linked b-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) transferase
(OGT) that modiﬁes target proteins in cytosol, mitochondria,
and nucleus (7). Consequently, the HBP has emerged as a
versatile regulator of signaling cascades inﬂuencing cell cycle
(8), growth (5), metabolism (6, 9), and stress (7, 10). OGT has
previously been reported to be overexpressed in a range of
cancers, such as breast cancer (11) and lung and colon cancers
(12). Knockdown of OGT reduces tumor growth in breast
cancer mouse model (11) and invasion in colon cancer cell
lines (12), suggesting that OGT activity contributes to the
transformation phenotype. Some reports suggest that OGT
serves similar role in prostate cancer cell lines, in part, through
the O-linked glycosylation of FOXM1 (13), but no study has yet
explored the regulation of the rate-limiting steps in the HBP
pathway or assessed the effect of OGT inhibition in an unbiased
way.

Norway) and obtained from "The ProstateBiobank - a resource
for urological research in Norway" (http://www.ous-research.
no/home/tasken/Research%20interests/10769). Clinical parameters of this prostate cancer patient cohort are available in
Supplementary Table S3. Samples were treated with RNALater
at 4 C overnight according to the manufacture's instructions
(Qiagen) and stored at 80 C. The pathology of the samples
was veriﬁed by uropathologist. Written consent was obtained
from all patients, and the project was approved by The
Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics
(REK sør-øst 2010/2218). One microgram of total RNA was
reverse transcribed using the High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA
Master Mix (Applied BioSystems) according to manufacturer's
instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) was conducted using 1 ng of cDNA with Fast SYBR Green PCR
MasterMix (Applied Biosystems) for the detection of GFPT1,
OGT, and UAP1 (primer sequences are given in Supplementary
Table S4). TaqMan Gene expression Assays (Applied Biosystems) were used to determine the mRNA expression of the AR,
ERG, MYC, GADPH, TBP, ALAS1, b-ACTIN, and 18S. An ABI
HT7900 Sequence Detection System was used according to
manufacturer's recommendations. Each cDNA sample was
tested in triplicate and mean Ct values were calculated. The
mRNA expression level was determined using the comparative
Ct method and normalization to the geometric mean of
GAPDH, ALAS1, 18s, ACTB, and TBP. The expression level of
the gene of interest in the normal tissue was set to the value of
1, and the values for the matched tumor sample were calculated accordingly. The difference in mRNA expression between
matched normal and tumor sample were tested by a dependent sample t test. All data were analyzed using SPSS v.19
software (SPSS).
Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry
Patient cohort. Radical prostatectomy specimens were
available from 3,261 patients, treated in the Department of
Urology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf
(Hamburg, Germany) between 1992 and 2008 (14). Follow-up
data were available for 3,057 patients, ranging from 0.1 to 228.7
months (mean 101.6 months). None of the patients received
neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. Additional (salvage) therapy
was initiated in case of a biochemical relapse (BCR). In all
patients, prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA) values were measured
quarterly in the ﬁrst year, followed by biannual measurements
in the second, and annual measurements after the third year
following surgery. Recurrence was deﬁned as a postoperative
PSA of 0.2 ng/mL and rising thereafter. The ﬁrst PSA value
above or equal to 0.2 ng/mL was used to deﬁne the time of
recurrence. Patients without evidence of tumor recurrence
were censored at the last follow-up. All prostatectomy specimens were analyzed according to a standard procedure. All
prostates were completely parafﬁn embedded, including
whole-mount sections as previously described (15). All hematoxylin and eosin stained histologic sections from all prostatectomy specimens were reviewed and one 0.6 mm thick tissue
core was punched out from a representative cancer area and
transferred onto a tissue microarray (TMA) format as
described (16). The 3,261 cores were distributed among 7 TMA

blocks each containing 129 to 522 tumor samples. For internal
controls, each TMA block also contained different various
control tissues, including normal prostate tissue.
Immunohistochemistry. Following immunohistochemistry (IHC) optimization for OGT (mouse monoclonal; Novus
Biologicals #NB300-524; dilution 1:1350), the TMA was immunostained. Slides were deparafﬁnized and exposed to heatinduced antigen retrieval for 5 minutes in an autoclave at pH
9.0. Bound primary antibody was visualized using the DAKO
EnVision Kit (DAKO).
Nuclear OGT staining (0, þ1, þ2, þ3) was scored for each
tissue spot. This scoring pattern has been used previously (17).
Tissue samples without deﬁnite prostate cancer were excluded.
Statistical analysis. Statistical calculations were conducted with JMP statistical software (Version 8.0, SAS institute). Contingency tables were calculated with the c2 test and
Fisher exact test to analyze differences between groups. Survival curves were calculated by the Kaplan–Meier method and
compared with the log-rank test.
Technical issues. As in all TMA studies, a fraction of the
cases were noninformative due to complete lack of tissue
samples (n ¼ 475) or absence of unequivocal cancer tissue
(n ¼ 799).
Cell lines and maintenance
Cells were obtained from the American Tissue Culture
Collection (ATCC) and maintained according to ATCC
guidelines. Cell lines were authenticated by the provider
and were used within 6 months receipt. LNCaP and PC-3
cells were grown in RPMI media supplemented with 10%
FBS. VCaP cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle
Medium supplemented with 10% FBS. RWPE-1 cells were
maintained in Keratinocyte-SFM (KSFM) media supplemented with EGF and bovine pituitary extract, according to
manufacturer's instructions. Before R1881 stimulation, cells
were maintained in phenol red-free media supplemented
with 10% charcoal-stripped serum for 72 hours (LNCaP and
VCaP), whereas RWPE-1 cells were maintained in KSFM
media supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin. The
viability of cells was assessed with an MTS assay (Promega)
according to manufacturer's instructions.
Preparation of cell lysates and Western blotting
All the steps were conducted at 4 C, unless otherwise
mentioned. Cells were washed once with PBS and harvested
into cell lysis buffer (10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmol/L
EDTA, 0.5 mmol/L EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodiumdeoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 140 mmol/L NaCl þ Complete protease inhibitor mixture; Roche), rotated for 15 minutes and
centrifuged 14,000 g 10 minutes. Supernatant was collected
and protein concentration determined with bicinchoninic acid
(BCA) assay. Of note, 10 to 25 mg of lysate was separated with
SDS-PAGE, using 4% to 12% gradient gels (Invitrogen) and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were
probed with antibodies against OGT (Santa Cruz), GFPT1,
ACTIN, b-tubulin, UAP1 (Sigma), MYC (Epitomic), and RL2
(Abcam). Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish
peroxidase -conjugated secondary antibodies against cognate

3,000 mg of protein was precleared with unspeciﬁc antibody
(Santa Cruz) and protein A-goated magnetic beads (immunoprecipitation) or unbound agarose beads (Vector Labs) for 2
hours. Precleared extract was used for immunoprecipitation
(RL2 antibody, Abcam), or lectin pulldown (Wheat Germ
Agglutinin, WGA, VectorLabs) overnight. Protein G-goated
magnetic beads were added to the immunoprecipitation reaction, incubated for 2 hours and washed with immunoprecipitation wash buffer (0.5% NP-40, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 20 mmol/L
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Lectin pulldown was washed 3 times with
lectin wash buffer (0.1% Tween, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0).
RT-PCR and expression proﬁling of the cell lines
RNA was collected by illustraMiniSpin (GE Healthcare)
according to manufacturer's instructions. One microgram of
RNA was used to produce cDNA (qScript cDNA Synthesis Kit,
Quanta Biosciences). Subsequently, 0.3 mL was used for quantitative PCR (qPCR). Ampliﬁcation was conducted as follows:
10 minutes 95 C followed by 40 cycles 30 seconds 60 C, 30
seconds extension, ﬁnal extension 5 minutes in 72 C. Genes
detected with SYBR Green are listed in the Supplementary

inhibitor has an IC50 value of 30 to 53 mmol/L, depending on the
isoform of the enzyme (18) and it has been used to target OGT in

from Lifetechnologies (s16094 and s16095), and RNAiMax was
used for the transfection.

Results
Hexosamine biosynthetic pathway is upregulated during
early stages of prostate cancer
We have previously reported that the AR is a regulator of
both metabolic and cell-cycle gene networks (2). In particular,
we and others have found that genes associated with metabolic
pathways are signiﬁcantly overexpressed in prostate cancer (2,
3, 20). By combining publicly available chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data for 2 key transcription factors in
prostate cancer (AR; ref. 2; ERG; ref. 21) and clinical gene
expression data from 11 separate studies (20), we identiﬁed 195
genes, which have binding sites within their promoters and are
overexpressed in the clinical setting (Supplementary Table S1).
A pathway analysis on this geneset highlighted O-glycan
biosynthesis and amino and sugar nucleotide metabolism as
signiﬁcantly deregulated processes (Supplementary Table S1).
As a classiﬁer, O-glycan biosynthesis encompasses complex
sugar chains attached to plasma membrane proteins (22) and
single O-GlcNAc modiﬁcation occurring in other cell compartments (7). Importantly, single O-GlcNAc modiﬁcation is catalyzed by only one enzyme in humans (OGT), which requires
the activity of HBP and therefore functions as a metabolic
integration point. The ﬂux through HBP is controlled by the
rate-limiting enzyme glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 (GFPT1).

Microarrays
The purity and quantity of the extracted RNA were measured
using the NanoDrop ND1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop
Technologies), and the RNA integrity was evaluated using the
Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the RNA nano 6000 kit (Agilent
Technologies Inc.,). Synthesis of cDNA, cRNA ampliﬁcation,
and hybridization of cRNA onto the Illumina HumanHT-12 v.4
Expression BeadChips (Illumina Inc,) was carried out as per
manufacturer's instructions. Data extraction, quantile normalization, and initial quality control of the bead summary
raw data were conducted using GenomeStudio v2011.1 from
Illumina and the Gene Expression module v1.9.0. The data were
annotated using the HumanHT-12_V4_0_R2_15002873_B.bgx
annotation ﬁle from Illumina. Microarray data are deposited
in Gene Expression Omnibus with an accession number
GSE44624.

Biomarker validation
We sought to validate the transcript expression of the HBP
genes in clinical samples. For this, we had access to 29 prostate
cancer patient samples (matched tumor and normal tissue).
We found that the enzymes catalyzing the rate-limiting step
(GFPT1) and the enzyme catalyzing the ﬁnal step in the HBP,
UAP1 (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase 1) are
upregulated in localized prostate cancer (P < 0.05; Fig. 1A).
OGT is an integration point of HBP that is required to modify
target proteins via O-linked glycosylation and acts as a critical
regulator of protein stability and activity. We ﬁrst conﬁrmed
that OGT is upregulated in localized prostate cancer in the
mRNA level (Fig. 1A) and went on to assess the protein level
expression of OGT in 1,987 clinically annotated prostate cancers by IHC (Fig. 1B and Table 1). Increased OGT expression
correlated with increasing Gleason score and pT/pN stages
(P < 0.0001), preoperative PSA (P < 0.01), and also with BCR
(P < 0.0001; Table 1 and Fig. 1C).

characterized by ampliﬁcation and overexpression of wild-type
AR (24). LNCaP and VCaP cells were deprived of androgens for
72 hours to minimize AR activity and then treated with a
synthetic androgen (R1881) and mRNA was extracted after 18
hours. The expression of GFPT1 and UAP1 were increased by
over 2-fold in both LNCaP and VCaP cells (Fig. 2A and B). The
upregulation of GFPT1 and UAP1 was conﬁrmed at the protein
level in both cell lines (Fig. 2D and E).
To determine whether the hormone-dependent upregulation of the HBP enzymes is a feature found preferentially in
cancer cell lines, we used RWPE-1 cells as a contrast control.
This cell line was derived from normal prostate epithelia and
expresses wild-type AR (25). RWPE-1 cells were cultured in the
absence of growth factors for 48 hours to achieve a clear
response to androgens, stimulated with R1881 and mRNA and
protein lysates were collected. We observed no changes in the
expression of genes associated with the HBP at the transcript
(Fig. 2C) or protein levels (Fig. 2F).
Targeting OGT with a small-molecule inhibitor or siRNA
decreases cell viability
Having established the cancer-speciﬁc upregulation of HBP
enzymes, we wanted to inhibit this pathway and hypothesized

5280

Cancer Res; 73(16) August 15, 2013

that the most prominent target is OGT, which is positioned to
integrate HBP activity to regulate target proteins and can be
targeted with small-molecule inhibitors (18). We treated
LNCaP and VCaP cells with a concentration gradient of an
OGT inhibitor (ST045849) for 48 hours and assessed the
viability using an MTS assay. OGT inhibitor caused dosedependent decrease in the viability, and the highest concentration (corresponding to IC50; ref. 18) caused approximately
50% decrease in the viability in both cell lines (Fig. 3A and B). In
addition, targeting OGT with siRNA reduced the growth rate of
AR-positive prostate cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
OGT inhibitor decreases the expression of genes
associated with DNA replication and cell cycle
The activity of OGT has been reported to be of high importance for the growth of cancer cells, whereas no study has
attempted to assess the mechanism of action in an unbiased
way (6, 11–13, 26, 27). However, effects on the activity of
transcription factors through targeting OGT have previously
been reported (11, 26). Consequently, to understand how OGT
exerts its functions in prostate cancer cells, we used expression
arrays. To minimize confounding effects from apoptosis, we
selected a dose that caused maximally 20% decrease in cell

total of 218 cases and we selected the prostatectomy samples that later on developed into metastatic disease and compared these with the cases without
prostate cancer (PAN) based on the clinical data described in Supplementary Table S1 of Taylor and colleagues (32).

expression arrays and data were processed using J-Express (28)
to produce lists of up- and downregulated genes from each
treatment and time point (Supplementary Table S2.). We ﬁrst
evaluated the expression proﬁles after treating cells with
siOGT. Strikingly, MGEA5, a gene encoding for O-GlcNAcase,
was the topmost downregulated gene (after OGT) at 24 hours
(Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Fig. S1B). This is
in good agreement with previous reports showing that inhibition of OGT expression with siRNA is rapidly compensated by
commensurate loss of MGEA5 (29). MGEA5 catalyses the
removal of O-GlcNAc from OGT substrates and consequently
this compensation effect underscores the importance of this
pathway but also challenges the interpretation of OGT knockdown data.
We therefore concentrated on the data generated from
cells treated with the OGT inhibitor. First, we took the 5
most up- or downregulated genes from 24 hours time point
for validation with qPCR. We observed 1.5- to 5-fold increase
in the levels of DDIT3, AKR1C2, ARHGEF2, AKR1C4, and
FAM129A (Fig. 3D). Next, we analyzed the expression levels
of the 5 most downregulated genes CDC2, c11orf82, ATAD2,
MCM10, and ASF1B, all of which, except for c11orf82, were
downregulated by more than 50% at a 24-hour time point. To
understand the signiﬁcance of the altered gene expression
proﬁle, we conducted a pathway enrichment analysis with
DAVID (30, 31) gene ontology enrichment tool (Supplementary Table S2). This approach revealed a consistent downregulation of gene networks associated with cell-cycle progression and DNA processing, upon treatment with OGT
inhibitor.
We wanted to understand the clinical relevance of OGT
inhibitor-induced changes in the expression proﬁle, and therefore evaluated the expression of the 20 most downregulated
genes common to both time points in clinical samples using
data published in Taylor and colleagues (32). Interestingly,
genes downregulated by OGT inhibitor were overexpressed in
the prostate cancer tissue of patients with metastatic prostate
cancer (Fig. 3E).
Inhibition of OGT destabilizes c-MYC in prostate cancer
cells
OGT is a known epigenetic regulator (6), and we wanted
to assess whether OGT inhibitor-induced changes in the
transcriptome are mediated by speciﬁc transcription factors.
We therefore took the 200 most downregulated genes common to both time points and uploaded them into the
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool (Ingenuity Systems Inc,
www.ingenuity.com.) to look for common upstream regulators (Supplementary Table S2). The E2F family of transcription factors was the most prominent group of transcription
factors discovered in this analysis. We next compared the
expression levels of the candidate transcription factors with
the expression levels of OGT in a large prostate cancer gene
expression array dataset (32) and found that c-MYC is tightly
coexpressed with OGT (Supplementary Fig. S2A). We wanted
to take a more stringent approach and took only the 20 most
downregulated genes common to both time points and used
an analysis based on ﬁrst neighbor associations with other

www.aacrjournals.org

factors as reported in the REACTOME. By these criteria,
c-MYC was the sole transcription factor linked to the network (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
Consequently, we assessed the effects of OGT inhibitor on
the stability of c-MYC. We ﬁrst conﬁrmed that OGT inhibitor
was taken up by the cells by assessing the total O-GlcNAc
signal in cell lysates after treatment with drug using blotting
and densitometry. We observed a dose-dependent decrease
in the levels of O-GlcNAc in 3 cell lines (LNCaP, VcaP, and
PC3; Fig. 4A). The highest dose caused a minimum of 34%
decrease in O-GlcNAc levels. The level of inhibition is similar
to previously reported responses using the same drug (19).
Next, we assessed the effects of OGT inhibitor on c-MYC and
found that inhibition of OGT results in loss of c-MYC in both
AR-positive (LNCaP and VCaP) and AR-negative (PC3) prostate cancer cell lines (Fig. 4A). Treatment of cells with the
OGT inhibitor did not reduce c-MYC mRNA levels (Fig. 3D),
suggesting that OGT regulates c-MYC stability through a
posttranscriptional mechanism. OGT activity can also be
reduced by targeting the enzyme with siRNA and the levels
of c-MYC decreased signiﬁcantly after knocking down of
OGT for 96 hours (Supplementary Fig. S3A). c-MYC is known
to be modiﬁed by O-GlcNAc modiﬁcation (33, 34) and we
conﬁrmed this in prostate cancer cells with lectin- and
immunoprecipitation-based enrichments (Supplementary
Fig. S3B and S3C).
The data from prostate cancer cell lines support a link
between OGT activity and c-MYC. The importance of this
oncogenic transcription factor has been shown in a range of
cancers, and ampliﬁcation of the MYC locus has also been
associated with poor prognosis in patients with prostate
cancer (35). We speculated that OGT overexpression might
associate with c-MYC copy number variation in the clinical
setting to increase signaling via c-MYC oncogene in the lethal
prostate cancer. The copy number status of MYC has been
determined for 1,306 patients (35) in the cohort used to assess
OGT expression here, which enabled us to test the potential
association between MYC and OGT in the clinical setting.
Interestingly, we observed a statistically signiﬁcant association
(P ¼ 0.0012) between the increase in MYC copy number and
OGT intensity (Fig. 4B). For the further validation, we went on
to assess the potential coexpression between OGT and MYC in
the mRNA level. Interestingly, we found a positive correlation
between OGT and MYC, but not between OGT and AR or OGT
and ERG (Fig. 4C).

Discussion
In this study, we used bioinformatics to identify dysregulated gene networks during the early stages of prostate
cancer development. This approach led to the identiﬁcation
of HBP as a pathway capable of discriminating between
benign prostate tissue and cancerous tissue. We conﬁrmed
the upregulation of the rate-limiting and the ﬁnal enzymes
in HBP in patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer
(Fig. 1A). These results are in good agreement with recent
studies reporting GFPT1 as a candidate oncogene in pancreatic cancer (36). We also found elevated mRNA levels of

Figure 4. OGT activity is required for c-MYC stabilization. A, LNCaP, VcaP, and PC3 cells were treated with a concentration gradient of OGT inhibitor for
48 hours and harvested for Western blotting. RL2 antibody was used to assess the levels of O-linked glycosylation in cell lysates. Densitometric analysis of
O-GlcNAc levels was conducted on the entire lane as previously described (48) and normalized to the intensity of actin. The value for the vehicle-treated
condition was set to one, and the O-GlcNAc signal in each treatment condition is given under the blot as a proportion of the vehicle signal. B, evaluation
of OGT staining and MYC alterations in prostatectomy samples. Samples were analyzed on the basis of staining intensities for OGT shown in Fig. 1B, whereas
FISH of MYC for this patient cohort has been reported previously (35). The classiﬁcations listed are "normal" (no ploidy change), "poly" (gene copy >2, ratio 1),
"gain" (ratio 1-2), and amp (ratio>2). We found statistically signiﬁcant coexpression between OGT expression and MYC ampliﬁcation (P ¼ 0.0012). C,

18S) and then to normal tissue.

OGT in prostate cancer tissue and conﬁrmed this result by
IHC (Fig. 1B and C and Table 1). OGT and O-linked glycosylation have been frequently associated with cancer development (11–13, 19, 26, 37).
AR has been acknowledged as an important driver of
prostate cancer (1), and we observed that both the ratelimiting enzyme (GFPT1) and the last enzyme (UAP1) are
regulated by AR (Fig. 2A–F), which enables prostate cancer
cells to maintain inappropriately high levels of the HBP
enzymes. AR has been shown to activate multiple pathways
in prostate cancer cells (2, 3), and the importance of our
results lies in the identiﬁcation of a conﬁned AR-driven gene
module integrating several aspects of metabolism to regulate cell proliferation (Fig. 5).
Targeting OGT with short hairpin RNA in mouse xenograft
models decreases the growth of tumors (11, 13, 26). We found
that the protein level expression of OGT correlates with high
Gleason score and pN/T status in prostate cancer tissue and
also with biochemical recurrence (Table 1 and Fig. 1C). These
results position OGT as a candidate drug target and expres-

sion arrays revealed that treatment of cells with OGT inhibitor decreases the expression of genes associated with DNA
replication and cell-cycle progression (Supplementary Table
S2). We identiﬁed c-MYC as a candidate upstream regulator
of OGT inhibitor-induced changes in gene expression, and
conﬁrmed this association both in cell lines and in clinical
setting (Fig. 4). The importance of c-MYC for prostate cancer
has been previously documented (38–41). Taken together,
these results suggest that OGT activity integrates metabolic
ﬂux to regulate the stability of c-MYC (Fig. 5). This can be
viewed as a variation into the genetic "2-hit" hypothesis (42),
and we propose that increased OGT expression synergizes
with MYC copy number gain to promote prostate cancer
progression.
c-MYC is under both transcriptional and posttranslational
control, and protein is known to be modiﬁed by O-linked
glycosylation (33, 34). Recent therapeutic strategies to inhibit
c-MYC expression and activity in cancers have included targeting bromodomain-containing proteins with small-molecule
inhibitors. One example is a drug called JQ1, developed as an

Figure 5. HBP. We used clinical gene expression data of upregulated transcripts in localized prostate cancer (20) and ChIP-seq data on AR (2) and ERG (21) to
identify a pathway that is overexpressed in the clinical setting, is targeted by AR and ERG in vitro, and integrates metabolic ﬂux. HBP requires several key
metabolites, including glucose, glutamine, Acetyl-CoA, and UTP, which makes this pathway capable of sensing overall energy status of the cell. The ﬂux
through HBP is highlighted with a gray arrow. OGT uses UDP-GlcNAc as a substrate to modify target proteins to regulate their activity, highlighted here as

inhibitor of BRD4 (43). This drug reduces c-MYC expression at
the transcript level and has a signiﬁcant impact on tumorigenesis in lymphoma cell lines and mouse models (44, 45). In
contrast, the OGT inhibitor we used here reduced the protein
level of c-MYC without impacting on c-MYC transcript expression (Figs. 3D and 4A). The stabilization of c-MYC has been
reported to occur via serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A (46),
and our work adds glycosylation as an alternative mechanism
to stabilize c-MYC in cancer cells (Fig. 5). Future work will
focus on the development of new reagents able to discriminate
between glycosylated and nonglycosylated pools of this important oncogene.
Our data suggest that OGT activity supports the metabolic
reprogramming of tumor cells in the clinical setting by synergizing with MYC copy number gain to maximize c-MYC
activity. Taking further, our results support targeting OGT, or
indeed c-MYC, in the treatment of prostate cancer.
