Abstract
Indole-3-carbinol has emerged as a promising chemopreventive agent due to its in vivo efficacy in various animal models.
However, indole-3-carbinol exhibits weak antiproliferative
potency and is unstable in acidic milieu. Thus, this study
was aimed at exploiting indole-3-carbinol to develop potent
antitumor agents with improved chemical stability. This effort
culminated in OSU-A9 {[1-(4-chloro-3-nitrobenzenesulfonyl)1H-indol-3-yl]-methanol}, which is resistant to acid-catalyzed
condensation, and exhibits 100-fold higher apoptosis-inducing
activity than the parent compound. Relative to indole-3carbinol, OSU-A9 displays a striking qualitative similarity in
its effects on the phosphorylation or expression of multiple
signaling targets, including Akt, mitogen-activated protein
kinases, Bcl-2 family members, survivin, nuclear factor-KB,
cyclin D1, p21, and p27. The ability of OSU-A9 to concurrently
modulate this broad range of signaling targets underscores
its in vitro and in vivo efficacy in prostate cancer cells. Nevertheless, despite this complex mode of mechanism, normal
prostate epithelial cells were less susceptible to the antiproliferative effect of OSU-A9 than PC-3 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Treatment of athymic nude mice bearing
established s.c. PC-3 xenograft tumors with OSU-A9 at 10 and
25 mg/kg i.p. for 42 days resulted in a 65% and 85%, respectively, suppression of tumor growth. Western blot analysis
of representative biomarkers in tumor lysates revealed significant reductions in the intratumoral levels of phosphorylated (p-) Akt, Bcl-xL, and RelA, accompanied by robust
increases in p-p38 levels. In conclusion, the ability of OSU-A9
to target multiple aspects of cancer cell survival with high
potency suggests its clinical value in prostate cancer therapy.

Introduction
The chemopreventive potential of indole-3-carbinol, a naturally
occurring phytochemical in cruciferous vegetables (1), has received
much attention in light of its shown in vivo efficacy to protect
against chemically induced carcinogenesis in animals (2–7).
Moreover, the clinical benefits of indole-3-carbionol have also been
shown in human trials for cervical dysplasia (8), breast cancer

(9, 10), and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (11). Despite these
advances in translational research, the mechanism by which
indole-3-carbinol inhibits tumorigenesis remains inconclusive,
which, in part, might be attributable to its metabolic instability
and complicated pharmacologic properties. In an acidic milieu,
indole-3-carbinol undergoes spontaneous dehydration and condensation to form diindoylmethane and a series of oligomeric
products (12, 13), all of which exhibit in vitro antiproliferative
activities against cancer cells (14–18). Furthermore, mechanistic
evidence indicates that indole-3-carbinol facilitates growth arrest
and apoptosis by targeting a broad range of signaling pathways
pertinent to cell cycle regulation and survival, including those
mediated by Akt, nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB), Bcl-2, mitogenactivated protein (MAP) kinases, the cyclin-dependent kinase
(CDK) inhibitors p21 and p27, and cyclin D1 (reviews: refs. 19–23).
However, as these signaling targets often operate in a cell-specific
fashion, it remains in dispute whether any of them could solely
account for the effect of indole-3-carbinol on growth arrest and
apoptosis in tumor cells (24).
From a mechanistic perspective, the ability of indole-3-carbinol
and its metabolites to target a broad spectrum of signaling
pathways underlies their antiproliferative effects. However, these
agents suffer from metabolic instability, unpredictable pharmacokinetic properties, and low in vitro antiproliferative potency, which
render therapeutic concentrations difficult to achieve in the body.
Consequently, recent years have witnessed the use of diindoylmethane as a scaffold to carry out structural modifications, which
has led to three distinct antitumor agents with higher potency
reported in the literature: (p-substituted phenyl)-diindoylmethanes
[peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g (PPARg) agonists;
refs. 18, 25–28], SR13668 (an Akt inhibitor; refs. 29, 30), and an
indole-3-carbinol tetrameric derivative (a CDK6 inhibitor; ref. 31;
Fig. 1A). These novel agents exhibit Amol/L potency in inducing
apoptosis or cell cycle arrest, however, through signaling pathways
distinct from that affected by diindoylmethane.
In this study, we report the use of indole-3-carbinol as a lead
compound to develop antitumor agents with improved chemical
stability and apoptosis-inducing potency. This structural optimization effort culminated in the generation of OSU-A9, a novel,
acid-stable analogue with two orders of magnitude higher
apoptosis-inducing potency than the parental indole-3-carbinol.
Moreover, OSU-A9 retained the pleiotropic effects of indole3-carbinol on multiple signaling targets associated with growth
arrest and apoptosis. Equally important, despite this broad
spectrum of pharmacologic activities, normal prostate epithelial
cells were less sensitive to the antiproliferative effect of OSU-A9
relative to prostate cancer cell lines.

replicates.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. 1H-indole-3-carbaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the
starting material to synthesize 1H-indole-3-carbinol and series I to III
agents (Fig. 1A), of which the synthesis will be published elsewhere. The
identity and purity (z99%) of these synthetic derivatives were verified by
proton nuclear magnetic resonance, high-resolution mass spectrometry,
and elemental analysis. For in vitro experiments, these agents at various
concentrations were dissolved in DMSO, and were added to cells in medium
with a final DMSO concentration of 0.1%. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies
against various biomarkers were obtained from the following sources:
phosphorylated (p-)473Ser Akt, p-Bad, Bad, phosphorylated extracellular
signal-regulated kinases (p-ERK), phosphorylated c-Jun-NH2-kinase (p-JNK),
JNK, p-p38, p38, cyclin D1, and NF-nB, Cell Signaling Technologies; Akt,
ERKs, p27, p21, Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and AR, Santa Cruz Biotechnology;
survivin, R&D Systems; and h-actin, Sigma-Aldrich. Mouse monoclonal
anti-PARP antibody was purchased from PharMingen. The enhanced

chemiluminescence system for detection of immunoblotted proteins was
from GE Healthcare Bioscience. Other chemicals and biochemistry reagents
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise mentioned.
Cell culture. LNCaP androgen-responsive (p53+/+) and PC-3 androgennonresponsive (p53 / ) human prostate cancer cells were purchased from
the American Type Tissue Collection and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life
Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life
Technologies). Normal human prostate epithelial cells were obtained from
Cambrex Bioscience-Walkersville, and maintained in the vendor’s recommended defined prostate epithelial growth medium. All cell types were
cultured at 37jC in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.
Cell viability analysis. The effect of test agents on cell viability was
assessed by using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay in 6 to 12 replicates. Cancer cells and prostate
epithelial cells were grown in 5% FBS–supplemented RPMI 1640 or 5% FBS–
supplemented prostate epithelial growth medium, respectively, in 96-well,
flat-bottomed plates for 24 h, and then exposed to various concentrations

of test agents in the same medium for the indicated time intervals. Controls
received DMSO vehicle at a concentration equal to that in drug-treated
cells. At the end of the treatment, the medium was removed, replaced by
200 AL of 0.5 mg/mL of MTT in the same medium, and cells were incubated
in the CO2 incubator at 37jC for 2 h. Supernatants were removed from the
wells, and the reduced MTT dye was solubilized in 200 AL/well DMSO.
Absorbance at 570 nm was determined on a plate reader.
Cell proliferation. PC-3 and LNCaP cells were seeded into six-well
plates at f200,000 per well in 5% FBS–containing RPMI 1640. Following a 24 h attachment period, cells were treated in triplicate with the
indicated concentrations of test agent or DMSO vehicle in 5% FBS–
containing RPMI 1640. At different time intervals, cells were harvested by
trypsinization and counted using a Coulter counter (Model Z1 D/T,
Beckman Coulter).
Apoptosis analysis. Three apoptosis biomarkers were used to assess
drug-induced apoptosis by Western blot analysis: cytochrome c release,
caspase-3 activation, and PARP cleavage. Cytosolic-specific, mitochondriafree lysates for cytochrome c analysis was prepared according to an
established procedure (32). After drug treatments, both the incubation
medium and adherent cells in T-75 flasks were collected and centrifuged at
600  g for 5 min. The pellet fraction was recovered, placed on ice, and
triturated with 300 AL of a chilled hypotonic lysis solution [50 mmol/L
PIPES-KOH (pH 7.4), containing 220 mmol/L mannitol, 68 mmol/L sucrose,
50 mmol/L KCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 2 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L DTT, and a
mixture of protease inhibitors including 100 Amol/L AEBSF, 80 nmol/L
aprotinin, 5 Amol/L bestatin, 1.5 Amol/L E-64 protease inhibitor, 2 Amol/L
leupeptin, and 1 Amol/L pepstatin A]. After a 45-min incubation on ice, the
mixture was centrifuged at 200  g for 10 min. The supernatant was
collected in a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for
30 min. Equivalent amount of protein (50 Ag) from each supernatant was
subject to immunoblotting with anti–cytochrome c antibodies, as described
below.
With regard to the other two apoptosis biomarkers, collected drugtreated cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in lysis buffer
containing 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8), 137 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L CaCl2,
10% glycerol, 1% NP40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 Amol/L 4-(2aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin at 10 Ag/mL, and aprotinin
at 10 Ag/mL. Soluble cell lysates were collected after centrifugation at
10,000  g for 5 min. Equivalent amounts of proteins (60–100 Ag) from each
lysate were subject to immunoblotting with antibodies against caspase-3 or
PARP as described below.
Immunoblotting. Biomarkers of apoptosis and signaling components
associated with cell survival and growth arrest were assessed by Western
immunoblotting as follows. Treated cells were washed in PBS, resuspended
in SDS sample buffer, sonicated for 5 s, and then boiled for 5 min. After brief
centrifugation, equivalent amounts of proteins from the soluble fractions of
cell lysates were resolved in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels on a Minigel
apparatus, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a semidry
transfer cell. The transblotted membrane was washed thrice with TBS
containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). After blocking with TBST containing 5%
nonfat milk for 60 min, the membrane was incubated with an appropriate
primary antibody at 1:500 dilution (with the exception of anti–h-actin
antibody, 1:2,000) in TBST–5% low fat milk at 4jC for 12 h, and was then
washed thrice with TBST. The membrane was probed with goat anti-rabbit
or anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugates (1:2,500) for 90 min at
room temperature, and washed thrice with TBST. The immunoblots were
visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence.
Molecular modeling. Molecular structures of A7, OSU-A9, and A12 were
subjected to energy minimization using the Merck Molecular Force Field
program available as part of the Macromodel 7.0 software package
(Schrodinger4). The minimum conformations were then fully optimized at
a density functional theory level of B3LYP/6-31G* basis set using Gaussian
03 (Gaussian, Inc.). All of the fully optimized structures were confirmed by

normal mode analysis; no negative frequencies were found. Computations
for electron density and electrostatic potential were then carried out for
each of the fully optimized structures with a grid of 216,000 points using
Gaussian 03. Molecular electrostatic potential maps for each compound
were generated with the electrostatic potential mapped onto the electron
density. The electron density isosurface value was 0.002 (electron/Å) with a
range of 0.03 to 0.03 for the electrostatic potential. All molecular modeling
calculations and manipulations were done on Silicon Graphics O2 (Silicon
Graphics, Inc.).
Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of acid stability. Indole-3carbinol and OSU-A9, 20 mg each, were dissolved in 1 mL of CD3OD. To
each solution, 100 AL of deuterium-labeled HCl were added, and nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded in a 300 MHz NMR
spectrometer at room temperature at different time intervals.
Luciferase assay for PPAR; activation. The PPAR-response element
(PPRE)-x3-TK-Luc reporter vector contains three copies of the PPRE
upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter-luciferase fusion gene and was
kindly provided by Dr. Bruce Spiegelman (Harvard University, Cambridge,
MA). The reporter gene assay was carried out as previously described (33).
In brief, PC-3 cells were cultured in a 100-mm plate in phenol red–free RPMI
1640 containing 10% FBS until the achieved 50% to 70% confluency, after
which they were transfected with 6 Ag of the plasmid using Fugene 6
(Roche) in RPMI 1640. For each transfection, herpes simplex virusthymidine kinase promoter–driven Renilla luciferase (phRL-TK) was used
as an internal control for normalization. Following transfections, cells were
treated as indicated in RPMI 1640 containing 10% charcoal-stripped FBS.
Cells were then collected into Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), and luciferase
activities in the cell lysates were determined by luminometry. All
transfection experiments were carried out in triplicate plates and repeated
separately at least thrice.
In vivo studies. Intact male NCr athymic nude mice (5–7 weeks of age)
were obtained from the National Cancer Institute. The mice were group
housed under conditions of constant photoperiod (12 h light/12 h dark)
with ad libitum access to sterilized food and water. All experimental
procedures using these mice were done in accordance with protocols
approved by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee
of The Ohio State University.
Each mouse was inoculated s.c. in the right flank with 5  105 PC-3 cells
in a total volume of 0.1 mL serum-free medium containing 50% Matrigel
(BD Biosciences) under isoflurane anesthesia. As tumors became established (mean starting tumor volume, 109 F 10 mm3), mice were
randomized to three groups (n = 7) that received the following treatments:
(a) OSU-A9 at 10 mg/kg body weight qd, (b) OSU-A9 at 25 mg/kg qd, and (c)
DMSO vehicle. Mice received treatments by i.p. injection (50 AL/mouse)
for the duration of the study. Tumors were measured weekly using calipers and their volumes calculated using a standard formula, as follows:
width2  length  0.52. Body weights were measured weekly. At terminal
sacrifice, a complete necropsy was done on all mice and PC-3 tumors were
harvested. A portion of each tumor was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at 80jC until needed for Western blot analysis of relevant
biomarkers, and the remainder was fixed in 10% formalin. All other tissues
were fixed overnight in 10% formalin then transferred to 70% ethanol. Fourmicrometer-thick, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were stained with
H&E by standard procedures. A core list of tissues from three mice per
group were evaluated microscopically animal by animal by a veterinary
pathologist in accordance with Society of Toxicologic Pathology–proposed
guidelines for repeat-dose toxicity studies (34), with the exception of
spinal cord and thymus. Blood from each mouse was submitted to The Ohio
State University Veterinary Clinical Laboratory Services for evaluation of
serum chemistry and hematologic variables routinely evaluated in a clinical
setting (35).
Statistical analysis. Differences in relative PPARg activation in vitro
and among group means of tumor volume in vivo were analyzed for
statistical significance using one-way ANOVA followed by the NeumanKeuls test for multiple comparisons. Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05. Statistical analyses were done using SPSS for Windows
(SPSS, Inc.).

Results
Structure-activity relationship. The intrinsic instability of
indole-3-carbinol in acidic conditions arises from the vinyl
hemiaminal moiety of the indole ring, which renders the molecule
highly susceptible to acid-catalyzed dehydration and condensation
to form oligomeric products (13). Mechanistically, this acid lability
could be circumvented by blocking the vinyl hemiaminal function
through substitution. Accordingly, to test the premise that indole-3carbinol was amenable to structural optimization, we synthesized
three series of N-substituted analogues: (1-aryloyl-1H-indol-3-yl)methanols (I), (1-arylsulfonyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-carbaldehydes (II),
and (1-arylsulfonyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-methanols (III; Fig. 1B).
These agents (A1–A24) were evaluated for their ability to reduce cell viability of PC-3 (p53 / ) androgen-nonresponsive and
LNCaP (p53+/+) androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells after
24-h exposure by MTT assay. Although the IC50 values of all
carboxamide derivatives (series I) were >50 Amol/L, some of the
derivatives in the II and III series showed improved antitumor
activities vis-à-vis indole-3-carbinol. Especially noteworthy is the
compound A9 {[1-(4-chloro-3-nitrobenzenesulfonyl)-1H-indol-3-yl]methanol; designated as OSU-A9}, which exhibited IC50 values of
2 and 3.8 Amol/L for PC-3 and LNCaP cells, respectively (Fig. 1B).
This antitumor potency was two orders of magnitude higher than
that of indole-3-carbinol (IC50, 512 and 267 Amol/L, respectively;
Fig. 2A). Moreover, assessment of effects on nonmalignant cells
revealed that prostate epithelial cells exhibited a 2.2- to 4.5-fold
lower sensitivity to OSU-A9 (IC50, 9 Amol/L) than the prostate
cancer cells (Fig. 2A).
The in vitro efficacy of OSU-A9 vis-à-vis indole-3-carbinol in
inhibiting the proliferation of PC-3 and LNCaP cells was also
examined by direct counting of drug-treated cells (Fig. 2B). OSUA9, at 2.5 Amol/L and above, completely suppressed cell
proliferation and cause a net decrease in cell numbers in both
cell lines, indicative of cytocidal activity. In line with the cell
viability data, a concentration of at least 300 Amol/L was required
for indole-3-carbinol to attain the same level of efficacy.
Molecular modeling analysis. The structure-activity analysis
revealed a stringent structural requirement for the high potency of
OSU-A9. Any change in the structure of the compound, such as
substitution of the sulfonyl (-SO2-) linker with a carbonyl (-CO-)
function (i.e., A7) or replacement of the nitro (-NO2) substituent
with an amino (-NH2) moiety (i.e., A12), resulted in a substantial
loss of antitumor activity (Fig. 1B). To shed light onto the structural
basis underlying this subtle structure-activity relationship, we
analyzed the configuration and surface electrostatic potential of
OSU-A9 versus those of A7 and A12 via modeling analysis (Fig. 3A).
As shown, OSU-A9 and A7 assumed vastly different configurations resulting from the structural differences between the
tetrahedron-like sulfonyl (-SO2-) and the triagonal-planar carbonyl
(-CO-) linkers. Equally important, the electropositive nature of the
nitrosubstituent on the appended phenyl ring was crucial to the
ability of OSU-A9 to induce apoptosis. Replacement of the electronwithdrawing nitro group with an electron-donating amino
function, as in A12, changed the regional surface potential,
resulting in the loss of apoptosis-inducing activity.
OSU-A9 resists acid-catalyzed dimerization. We used a NMR
technique to analyze the chemical stability of OSU-A9 versus
indole-3-carbinol in 0.1 N HCl by monitoring changes in the proton
signal associated with CH2OH (Fig. 3B). Individual compounds
(20 mg) were dissolved in 1 mL of deuterium-labeled methanol
(CD3OD). The NMR spectra revealed signals for the methylene

and OSU-A9, respectively (top spectra, left and right). Addition
of 100 AL of 0.1 N deuterium-labeled HCl to indole-3-carbinol
resulted in an immediate shift of the CH2 signal from 4.73 to
4.66 ppm (t = 5 min), indicating the chemical transformation of
indole-3-carbinol to an acid reaction mixture consisting of diindoylmethane and other oligomeric products (12, 13). On the other
hand, no appreciable change in the spectrum was noted after
exposure of OSU-A9 to HCl for up to 8 h, indicating its significantly
greater chemical stability.

A Potent Indole-3-Carbinol–Derived Antitumor Agent

OSU-A9 facilitates apoptosis by targeting multiple signaling
pathways identical to that of indole-3-carbinol. Evidence
suggest that the antiproliferative effect of OSU-A9 was, at least in
part, attributable to apoptosis, reminiscent of that of indole-3carbinol. Western blot analysis showed a dose-dependent effect of
both agents on cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm, caspase-3
activation, and PARP cleavage (Fig. 4A). The effects of indole-3carbinol and OSU-A9 on these two apoptosis-related biomarkers
were qualitatively similar, albeit with a 100-fold difference in
potency.
From a translational perspective, the mechanism by which
OSU-A9 mediated antiproliferative effects warranted investigation.
The finding that many indole derivatives, including diindoylmethanes, exhibited PPARg agonist activity (18, 25–28, 36, 37)
raised the possibility that PPARg activation might contribute to
the apoptosis-inducing effect of OSU-A9. Accordingly, we used an
established PPRE-luciferase reporter assay (33) to assess the ability
of OSU-A9 to transactivate PPARg in PC-3 cells. However, even
at 20 Amol/L, OSU-A9 lacked appreciable activity in PPARg
transactivation, whereas the PPARg agonist rosiglitazone induced
significant activation of the reporter gene (Fig. 4B).
Indole-3-carbinol has been reported to target an array of
signaling pathways to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in
cancer cells (reviews: refs. 19–23). Consequently, we examined
the dose-dependent effect of OSU-A9 vis-à-vis indole-3-carbinol
in PC-3 cells on the phosphorylation and/or expression status
of a series of molecular targets reported for indole-3-carbinol in
the literature. These targets comprised three categories of
biomarkers: (a) phosphorylation of signaling kinases: Akt and its
downstream effector GSK3h, ERKs, JNKs, and p38; (b) phosphorylation/expression of Bcl-2 family members: Bad, Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL,
and Mcl-1; (c) expression of other apoptosis and cell-cycle

regulatory proteins: survivin, NF-nB/RelA, cyclin D1, p27, and p21
(Fig. 5).
Despite a 100-fold difference in antitumor potency, the pharmacologic profiles of OSU-A9 and indole-3-carbinol in interfering
with these target proteins were virtually identical. As shown, both
agents facilitated dose-dependent dephosphorylation of Akt and its
substrates GSK3h and Bad, accompanied by increased phosphorylation of ERKs, JNK, and p38. Moreover, the dose-dependent
effects of OSU-A9 on suppressing the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL,
Mcl-1, survivin, NF-nB, and cyclin D1, and on up-regulating the
expression of Bax, p27, and p21 paralleled those of indole-3carbinol.
Together, these data suggest that OSU-A9 retains the pleiotropic
effects of indole-3-carbinol with regard to the activating apoptosis
machinery by targeting multiple signaling pathways. Pursuant to
these findings, the in vivo antitumor potential of OSU-A9 was
further assessed in a PC-3 xenograft animal model.
OSU-A9 suppresses PC-3 tumor xenograft growth in vivo.
The maximum tolerated dose of OSU-A9 in athymic nude mice was
determined by i.p. injection at 5, 10, 25, and 50 mg/kg/d (n = 3)
continuously for 14 days (data not shown). No more than 10%
weight loss was noted at doses up to 25 mg/kg (Fig. 6A, inset).
To examine the in vivo antitumor efficacy of OSU-A9, athymic
nude mice bearing established s.c. PC-3 tumor xenografts (mean
tumor volume, 109 F 10 mm3) were treated i.p. for 42 days with
OSU-A9 at 10 or 25 mg/kg daily, or with vehicle. As shown in
Fig. 6A, treatment of mice with 10 and 25 mg/kg of OSU-A9
significantly inhibited PC-3 tumor growth by 66% and 85%,
respectively, relative to vehicle-treated controls (P < 0.01).
Importantly, mice seemed to tolerate treatment with OSU-A9
without overt signs of toxicity, without significant loss of body
weight compared with vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 6A, inset),

of the chemical stability of OSU-A9 versus

OSU-A9 and indole-3-carbinol, 20 mg
each, were dissolved in 1 mL of CD3OD.
To each solution, 100 AL of deuteriumlabeled HCl were added, and NMR spectra
were recorded in a 300 MHz NMR
spectrometer. Treatment of indole-3carbinol with HCl led to oligomerization to
form an acid reaction mixture (12, 13)
consisting of diindoylmethane and other
oligomeric products, as evidenced by an
immediate shift of the CH2 signal (* in the
chemical structure) from 4.73 to 4.66 ppm.
In contrast, treatment of OSU-A9 with HCl
gave rise to no appreciable change in the
spectrum.

and with normal hematologic and serum chemistry findings. The
sole lesions observed at necropsy in all OSU-A9–treated mice were
mild to moderate amounts of fibrous adhesions that were limited
to the peritoneal surfaces of tissues, including the colon, seminal
vesicles, and body wall, and did not seem to compromise function.
Microscopically, there were no treatment-associated lesions in the
array of tissues examined in the OSU-A9–treated mice, with the
exception of the affected peritoneum, which was variably expanded
by mixtures of granulation and fibrous tissue and activated
macrophages. No lesions were observed in the vehicle-treated
controls.
To correlate this in vivo tumor-suppressive response to
mechanisms identified in vitro, the effects of OSU-A9 on six
representative intratumoral biomarkers of drug activity were
evaluated by immunoblotting of PC-3 tumor homogenates
collected after 42 days of treatment. These biomarkers included
the phosphorylation status of Akt and p38, and expression levels
of Bcl-xL, and NF-nB/RelA. As shown in Fig. 6B and C, the effects
of OSU-A9 on these biomarkers were qualitatively similar to those
observed in vitro, and reflect the dose-dependent tumor suppression in vivo. Treatment with OSU-A9 i.p. at 10 and 25 mg/kg/d
induced marked reductions in intratumoral levels of p-Akt

(83 F 8% and 94 F 1% reductions, respectively, compared with
vehicle-treated controls), Bcl-xL (34 F 8% and 86 F 4%,
respectively), and RelA (60 F 7% and 77 F 7%, respectively),
accompanied by increases in intratumoral levels of p-p38 (9.0 F
3.5-fold and 10.1 F 2.4-fold, respectively).

Discussion
During the course of tumor progression, cancer cells constitutively up-regulate cell proliferation– and cell survival–regulatory
signaling mechanisms, thereby overcoming genomic instability
and/or acquiring a drug-resistant phenotype. From a clinical
perspective, it is desirable to concomitantly target these molecular
abnormalities by using a combination therapy or an agent with
pleiotropic effects to optimize therapeutic outcomes (38). This
rationale constitutes the molecular basis for structurally optimizing
indole-3-carbinol to develop potent antitumor agents. This effort
has culminated in the generation of OSU-A9, which provides
considerable therapeutic advantages over indole-3-carbinol with
respect to chemical stability and antitumor potency.
The introduction of a (3-chloro-2-nitrobenzene)sulfonyl substituent onto the indole nucleus endowed OSU-A9 with resistance to

acid-catalyzed dehydration, and, equally important, a 100-fold
higher apoptosis-inducing potency. The unique stereoelectronic
property of this substituent allowed OSU-A9 to interact more
effectively with target proteins compared with indole-3-carbinol.
Meanwhile, this structural modification might also affect the
kinetic behavior of drug absorption in different cell lines, as
suggested by a crossover in the relative sensitivity to OSU-A9 versus
indole-3-carbinol between PC-3 and LNCaP cells; that is, LNCaP
cells were more sensitive to indole-3-carbinol–induced apoptosis
than PC-3 cells, whereas a reversal in the relative susceptibility was
noted with OSU-A9.
Relative to indole-3-carbinol, OSU-A9 displayed a striking
similarity in the effects on modulating the phosphorylation or
expression of a multitude of molecular targets, including Akt and
its downstream effectors GSK3h and Bad; the MAP kinases ERKs,
p38, and JNK; the Bcl-2 family members Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl1; the inhibitor of apoptosis protein survivin; NF-nB; cyclin D1; and
the CDK inhibitors p21 and p27 (Fig. 6D). Among these targets, the
ability of OSU-A9 and indole-3-carbinol to facilitate Akt dephos-

phorylation in conjunction with increased phosphorylation of
ERKs, JNK, and p38 is mechanistically intriguing. This finding is
reminiscent to that reported for a number of molecules, including
thrombin (39), sphingosine 1-phosphate (40), and kainate (41), in
different cell systems. Moreover, one study with thrombin in
human endothelial cells suggests a mechanistic link between the
activation of Rho/Rho-kinase signaling and drug-induced divergent
effects on the phosphorylation status of Akt and MAP kinases (39),
which is currently under investigation in OSU-A9–treated prostate
cancer cells.
Together, the aforementioned signaling kinases/proteins regulate cell cycle and apoptosis at multiple levels, including
transcriptional activation of gene expression, cell cycle checkpoint
control, intracellular kinase signaling, mitochondrial integrity, and
caspase activation, all of which are clinically relevant to the
tumorigenesis and progression of prostate cancer. This broad range
of antitumor activities underscores the in vitro and in vivo efficacy
of OSU-A9 in prostate cancer cells. It is especially noteworthy that,
despite this complicated mode of drug action, normal prostate

epithelial cells were less susceptible to the antiproliferative effect of
OSU-A9, reflecting the in vivo tolerance of this drug in tumorbearing nude mice.
Assessment of the in vivo efficacy in tumor-bearing nude mice
indicate that daily i.p. injection of OSU-A9 at 10 and 25 mg/kg/d
for 42 days resulted in a 65% and 85%, respectively, suppression
of established PC-3 xenograft tumor growth. Western blot analysis
of the tumor lysates revealed that the extent of changes in the
six representative biomarkers paralleled the dose-dependent
tumor-suppressive activity of OSU-A9. The concerted action on
these molecular targets underscores the therapeutic potential of
OSU-A9 to be developed into a potent antitumor agent not only as
a single agent, but also potentially in combination with other
chemotherapeutic drugs. Previously, indole-3-carbinol was shown
to sensitize prostate and breast cancer cells to cisplatin (19)
and tamoxifen (42), respectively. Use of OSU-A9 as a chemosen-

sitizing agent in prostate cancer cells is currently under way in
this laboratory.
OSU-A9 was well tolerated by tumor-bearing mice after 6 weeks
of repeat dosing. The absence of gross and microscopic lesions
in major organs together with normal clinical and hematologic
findings indicated that the intra-abdominal fibrous adhesions
observed in the OSU-A9–treated animals were likely nonspecific
reactions associated with chronic irritation induced by i.p.
injection of the drug. Although concerns regarding potential
toxicities arising from the use of drugs with pleiotropic actions
warrant consideration, our findings suggest that, at least in the
case of OSU-A9, such adverse effects are not an obligatory
consequence.
Although indole-3-carbinol is considered as a chemopreventive
compound, the studies described here were focused on the therapeutic efficacy of OSU-A9. Nevertheless, in light of the molecular

heterogeneity of premalignant lesions and the multifactorial
nature of carcinogenesis (43, 44), the pleiotropic effects of OSUA9 on multiple signaling pathways, along with its enhanced chemical stability and lack of evident toxicity, suggest its potential
in the context of chemoprevention. Using prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) as a clinically relevant intervention point
(45), we have evaluated, and continue to evaluate, the chemopreventive efficacy of other compounds developed in our laboratory
in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate model
(46) in which the predictable occurrence of PIN lesions is
a component of the multistage tumor progression of the model
(47). Dysplastic lesions similar to PIN precede the occurrence
of tumors in other models as well, such as the hormoneinduced model of prostate carcinogenesis in the Noble rat, in
which PIN was shown to be a suitable intermediate end point
for chemoprevention studies (48). The chemopreventive efficacy
of OSU-A9 clearly warrants investigation and studies to do so are
planned.

In conclusion, our results show that the novel indole-3-carbinol–
derived multitargeted agent, OSU-A9, is a potent antitumor agent
that modulates multiple aspects of cancer cell cycle regulation and
survival, including intracellular kinase signaling, cell cycle checkpoint control, mitochondrial integrity, and caspase activation. This
broad spectrum of antitumor activities in conjunction with low
toxicity underlies the translational potential of OSU-A9 and suggests
its viability as part of a therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer.
