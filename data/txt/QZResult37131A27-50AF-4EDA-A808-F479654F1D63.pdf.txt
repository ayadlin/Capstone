Abstract
Chemically functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWNT) have shown promise in tumor-targeted accumulation
in mice and exhibit biocompatibility, excretion, and little
toxicity. Here, we show in vivo SWNT drug delivery for tumor
suppression in mice. We conjugate paclitaxel (PTX), a widely
used cancer chemotherapy drug, to branched polyethylene
glycol chains on SWNTs via a cleavable ester bond to obtain
a water-soluble SWNT-PTX conjugate. SWNT-PTX affords
higher efficacy in suppressing tumor growth than clinical
Taxol in a murine 4T1 breast cancer model, owing to prolonged blood circulation and 10-fold higher tumor PTX uptake
by SWNT delivery likely through enhanced permeability and
retention. Drug molecules carried into the reticuloendothelial
system are released from SWNTs and excreted via biliary pathway without causing obvious toxic effects to normal organs.
Thus, nanotube drug delivery is promising for high treatment
efficacy and minimum side effects for future cancer therapy
with low drug doses. [Cancer Res 2008;68(16):6652–60]

Introduction
A holy grail in cancer therapy is to deliver high doses of drug
molecules to tumor sites for maximum treatment efficacy while
minimizing side effects to normal organs (1, 2). Through the
enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, nanostructured
materials on systemic injection can accumulate in tumor tissues by
escaping through the abnormally leaky tumor blood vessels (3–6),
making them useful for drug delivery applications. As a unique
quasi one-dimensional material, single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWNT) have been explored as novel drug delivery vehicles in vitro
(7–9). SWNTs can effectively shuttle various biomolecules into
cells, including drugs (7–9), peptide (10), proteins (11), plasmid
DNA (12), and small interfering RNA (13, 14), via endocytosis (15).
The intrinsic near-IR (NIR) light absorption property of carbon
nanotubes has been used to destruct cancer cells in vitro (16),
whereas their NIR photoluminescence property has been used for
in vitro cell imaging and probing (17). The ultrahigh surface area of
these one-dimensional polyaromatic macromolecules allows for
efficient loading of chemotherapy drugs (8). Various groups have
investigated the in vivo behavior of carbon nanotubes in animals
(18–20). It is found that well PEGylated SWNTs i.v. injected into
mice seem nontoxic over several months (21). Nanotubes accu-

mulated in the reticuloendothelial systems (RES) of mice are
excreted gradually via the biliary pathway and end up in the feces
(22). Targeted tumor accumulation of SWNTs functionalized with
targeting ligands RGD peptide or antibodies has shown high
efficiency (18, 20). These results set a foundation for further exploration of carbon nanotubes for therapeutic applications.
In the current work, we show SWNT delivery of paclitaxel (PTX)
into xenograft tumors in mice with higher tumor suppression
efficacy than the clinical drug formulation Taxol. The waterinsoluble PTX conjugated to PEGylated SWNTs exhibits high water
solubility and maintains similar toxicity to cancer cells as Taxol
in vitro. SWNT-PTX affords much longer blood circulation time of
PTX than that of Taxol and PEGylated PTX, leading to high tumor
uptake of the drug through EPR effect. The strong therapeutic
efficacy of SWNT-PTX is shown by its ability to slow down tumor
growth even at a low drug dose (5 mg/kg PTX). We observe higher
tumor uptake of PTX and higher ratios of tumor to normal organ
PTX uptake for SWNT-PTX than Taxol and PEGylated PTX, highly
desired for higher treatment efficacy and lower side effect. PTX
carried into RES organs by SWNT-PTX is released from the nanotube carriers likely via in vivo ester cleavage and is cleared out from
the body via the biliary pathway. The non-Cremophor composition
in our SWNT-PTX, rapid clearance of drugs from RES organs,
higher ratios of tumor-to-normal organ drug uptakes, and the fact
that tumor suppression efficacy can be reached at low injected
drug dose make carbon nanotube drug delivery a very promising
nanoplatform for future cancer therapeutics.

Materials and Methods
Functionalization of SWNTs with phospholipid-branched polyethylene glycol. Raw HiPco SWNTs (0.2 mg/mL) were sonicated in a 0.2
mmol/L solution of DSPE-PEG5000-4-arm-(PEG-amine) (see Supplementary
Data for the synthetic chemistry) for 30 min with a cup-horn sonicator
followed by centrifugation at 24,000  g for 6 h, yielding a suspension of
SWNTs with noncovalent phospholipid-branched polyethylene glycol (PEG)
coating in the supernatant (13, 14, 18). Excess surfactant and unreacted PEG
molecules were removed by repeated filtration through a 100-kDa molecular
weight cutoff (MWCO) filter (Millipore) and extensive washing with water.
PTX conjugation. PTX (LC Laboratories) was modified by succinic
anhydride (Aldrich) according to the literature, adding a carboxyl acid
group on the molecule at the C-2¶-OH position highlighted in Fig. 1A (23).
SWNTs (300 nmol/L, 0.05 mg/mL) with branched PEG-NH2 functionalization were reacted with 0.3 mmol/L of the modified PTX (dissolved in
DMSO) in the presence of 5 mmol/L 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)
carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC; Aldrich) and 5 mmol/L N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (Sulfo-NHS, Pierce). The solution was supplemented with
1 PBS at pH 7.4. After 6-h reaction, the resulting SWNT-PTX was purified
to remove unconjugated PTX by filtration through 5-kDa MWCO filters
and extensive washing.
UV-Vis-NIR absorbance spectra of the SWNT-PTX conjugates were measured by a Cary-6000i spectrophotometer. The concentration of SWNTs was
determined by the absorbance at 808 nm with a molar extinction coefficient
of 7.9  106 mol/Lcm 1 with an average tube length of f150 nm (16).

In vivo Drug Delivery with Carbon Nanotubes

Figure 1. Carbon nanotube for PTX delivery. A, schematic
illustration of PTX conjugation to SWNT functionalized
by phospholipids with branched PEG chains. The PTX
molecules are reacted with succinic anhydride (at the circled
OH site) to form cleavable ester bonds and linked to the
termini of branched PEG via amide bonds. This allows for
releasing of PTX from nanotubes by ester cleavage in vivo .
The SWNT-PTX conjugate is stably suspended in normal
physiologic buffer (PBS, as shown in the photo) and serum
without aggregation. B, UV-VIS-NIR spectra of SWNT before
(black curve ) and after PTX conjugation (red curve). The
absorbance peak of PTX at 230 nm (green curve ) was
used to measure the PTX loading on nanotubes and the
result was confirmed by radiolabel-based assay. Excess
unconjugated PTX was removed by extensive filtration and
washing. C, cell survival versus concentration of PTX for
4T1 cells treated with Taxol, PEG-PTX, DSEP-PEG-PTX,
or SWNT-PTX for 3 d. The PTX concentrations to cause
50% cell viability inhibition (IC50 values) were determined
by sigmoidal fitting to be 16.4 F 1.7 nmol/L for Taxol,
23.5 F 1.1 nmol/L for DSPE-PEG-PTX, 28.4 F 3.4 nmol/L
for PEG-PTX, and 13.4 F 1.8 nmol/L for SWNT-PTX.
Error bars based on four parallel samples. Plain SWNTs
(no PTX conjugated) are nontoxic (see Supplementary
Fig. S4).

Concentration of PTX loaded onto SWNTs was measured by the absorbance
peak at 230 nm (characteristic of PTX, Fig. 1A, green curve, after subtracting
the absorbance of SWNTs at that wavelength) with a molar extinction
coefficient of 31.7  103 mol/Lcm 1. Note that thorough removal of free
unbound PTX was carried out by filtration before the measurement to
accurately assess the amount of PTX loaded onto SWNTs. To confirm the
PTX loading measured by UV-VIS, 3H-PTX (see the following paragraph)
was conjugated to SWNTs. The PTX loading number on nanotubes
measured by radioactivity was consistent to that measured by UV-VIS
spectra for same batches of samples. The PTX concentration in each batch
of SWNT-PTX sample was measured before administration to the mice to
ensure the accuracy of dose used in the treatment.
PEGylated PTX (PEG-PTX) and DSPE-PEG-PTX were synthesized by
reacting 1 equivalent of 4-arm-(PEG-amine) (10 kDa) or DSPE-PEG50004-arm-(PEG-amine) (16 kDa), respectively, with 4 equivalents succinic
anhydride–modified PTX in the presence of EDC/NHS at the same reaction condition as conjugation of SWNT-PTX. Excess unreacted PTX was
removed by filtration via 5-kDa MWCO filters. The concentrations of PEGPTX and DSPE-PEG-PTX were measured by its absorbance spectrum. In the
case of radiolabeled 3H-PTX, 100 ACi (f5 Ag) of 3H-PTX (Moravek Biochemicals) were mixed with 10 mg of regular nonradioactive PTX and used
for conjugation to obtain SWNT-PTX or PEG-PTX to impart radioactivity.
Taxol was constituted following the clinical formulation. PTX (6 mg/mL)
with or without addition of 3H-PTX (50 ACi/mL, f2.5 Ag/mL) was dissolved
in 1:1 (v/v) mixture of Cremophor EL (Aldrich) and anhydrous ethanol
(Fisher) and stored at 20jC.
Cell toxicity assay. 4T1 murine breast cancer cell line ( from the
American Type Culture Collection) was cultured in the standard medium.
Cells were plated in 96-wall plates and treated with different
concentrations of SWNT-PTX, PEG-PTX, or Taxol for 3 d. Cell viability
after various treatments was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt assay
with CellTiter 96 kit (Promega).
Animal model and treatment. All animal experiments were performed
under a protocol approved by Stanford’s Administrative Panel on
Laboratory Animal Care. The 4T1 tumor models were generated by s.c.
injection of 2  106 cells in 50 AL PBS into the right shoulder of female
BALB/c mice. The mice were used for treatment when the tumor volume
reached 50 to 100 mm3 (f6 d after tumor inoculation). For the treatment,

150 to 200 AL of different formulations of PTX and SWNTs in saline were i.v.
injected into mice via the tail vein every 6 d. The injected doses were
normalized to be 5 mg/kg PTX. The tumor sizes were measured by a caliper
every other day and calculated as the volume = (tumor length)  (tumor
width)2/2. Relative tumor volumes (Fig. 2) were calculated as V/V 0 (V 0 was
the tumor volume when the treatment was initiated).

Tumor slice staining and imaging. Tumor slices (5 Am) were cut after
frozen in OCT medium and stained with standard fluorescent terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL),
Ki67, and CD31 staining procedures (see details in Supplementary Data). To
obtain the Raman mapping image of tumor slices for mice injected with
SWNT-PTX, 5-Am-thick paraffin-embedded tumor slices were mounted on
SiO2 substrate and mapped under a Renishaw micro-Raman microscope
with a line-scan model (100 mW laser power, 40 Am  2 Am laser spot size,
20 pixels each line, 2-s collection time, 20 objective). The SWNT G-band
Raman intensity was plotted versus X and Y positions across the liver slice
to obtain a Raman image.
Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution studies. Blood circulation was
measured by drawing f10 AL blood from the tail vein of tumor-free healthy
BALB/c mice after injection of 3H-labeled SWNT-PTX, Taxol, or PEG-PTX.
The blood samples were dissolved in a lysis buffer (1% SDS, 1% Triton X100, 40 mmol/L Tris-acetate, 10 mmol/L EDTA, 10 mmol/L DTT) with brief
sonication. Concentration of SWNTs in the blood was measured by a Raman
method (22). For 3H-PTX measurement, the blood lysate was decolorized by
0.2 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide (Aldrich) and the radioactivity was
counted by Tri-Carb 2800 TR (Perkin-Elmer) scintillation counter following
the vendor’s instruction. Blood circulation data were plotted as the blood
PTX or SWNT levels with the unit of percentage of injected dose per gram
tissue (% ID/g) against time after injection. Pharmacokinetic analysis was
performed by first-order exponential decay fitting of the blood PTX
concentration data with the following equation: blood concentration = A 
exp ( t/k), in which A was a constant (initial concentration) and t was the
time after injection. The pharmacokinetic variables, including volume of
distribution, areas under the curves, and circulation half-lives, are
calculated and presented in Supplementary Table S1.
For the biodistribution study, 4T1 tumor-bearing mice (tumor size,
f200 mm3) were sacrificed at 2 and 24 h after injection of 3H-labeled
SWNT-PTX, Taxol, or PEG-PTX. The organs/tissues were collected and split
into two halves for 3H-PTX and SWNT biodistribution studies. For the
3
H-PTX biodistribution, 50 to 100 mg of tissue were weighed and solubilized
in 1 mL of scintillation counting compatible Soluene-350 solvent (PerkinElmer) by incubation at 60jC overnight and decolorized by 0.2 mL of 30%
hydrogen peroxide. The 3H radioactivity in each organ/tissue was measured
by scintillation counting to obtain the biodistribution information of PTX
(unit: % ID/g). Note that all the biodistribution and circulation tests were
carried out at the treatment dose (normalized to 5 mg/kg PTX).
For SWNT biodistribution, the organs/tissues were wet weighed and
homogenized in the lysis buffer (same as used in the blood circulation
experiment) with a PowerGen homogenizer (Fisher Scientific). After heating
at 70jC for f2 h, clear homogenous tissue solutions were obtained for
Raman measurement as reported previously and described in Supplementary Data (18, 22).
Necropsy, blood chemistry, and histology study. Twenty-four
days after initiation of treatment, three mice from each treatment group
(SWNT-PTX and Taxol) and two age-matched female BALB/c control mice
were sacrificed with blood collected for serum chemistry analysis and
organs for histology studies (see details in Supplementary Data).
Statistical analysis. Quantitative data were expressed as mean F SD.
Means were compared using Student’s t test. P values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
As-grown HiPco SWNTs functionalized by PEGylated phospholipid (14, 18) were used, made by sonication of SWNTs in a water
solution of phospholipid-PEG and centrifugation to remove large
bundles and impurities. The length distribution of the SWNTs was
20 to 300 nm with a mean of f100 nm (Supplementary Fig. S1;
refs. 14, 18) The PEG functionalized SWNTs exhibited excellent
stability without agglomeration in various biological media, including serum (14, 18). We used branched PEG chains for functionalization of SWNTs (see Materials and Methods) to afford more

functional amine groups at the PEG termini for efficient drug
conjugation (22). PTX was conjugated at the 2¶-OH position (23)
to the terminal amine group of the branched PEG on SWNTs via
a cleavable ester bond (see Materials and Methods), forming a
SWNT-PTX conjugate highly soluble and stable in aqueous
solutions (Fig. 1A). The unconjugated PTX was removed thoroughly
from the SWNT-PTX solution by filtration. The loading of PTX on
SWNTs was characterized to be f150 per SWNT with f100 nm
length by radiolabeling method using tritium 3H-labeled PTX and a
UV-VIS-NIR optical absorbance (Fig. 1B; see Materials and
Methods). Dynamic light scattering showed hydrodynamic size of
SWNTs before and after PTX conjugation of 120.6 and 132.2 nm,
respectively, suggesting no significant aggregation of nanotubes
after conjugation of hydrophobic drug molecules. The SWNT-PTX
conjugate was found stable in physiologic buffers with little drug
release within 48 h (Supplementary Fig. S2). In mouse serum, the
release of PTX is faster but SWNT-PTX is still stable for hours
(Supplementary Fig. S2), which is much longer than the blood
circulation time of SWNT-PTX as described later. In vitro cell
toxicity tests performed with a 4T1 murine breast cancer cell line
found that SWNT-PTX exhibited similar toxicity as Taxol and
PEGylated PTX (Fig. 1C) without any loss of cancer cell destruction
ability. Confocal fluorescence images indicated the endocytosis
mechanism of the SWNT-PTX uptake by cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Consistent to the previous studies (7–14), no noticeable toxic effect to cells was observed for plain nanotube carriers
without drug even at high SWNT concentrations (Supplementary
Fig. S4).
We next moved to the in vivo cancer treatment on the PTXresistant 4T1 murine breast cancer mice model (24, 25). Female
BALB/c mice bearing s.c. inoculated 4T1 tumors were treated with
different forms of PTX over several weeks, including the clinical
Taxol formulation, PEG-PTX (see Materials and Methods), DSPEPEG-PTX, and SWNT-PTX (14 mice in this group). The treatments
were done by injecting Taxol, PEG-PTX, DSEP-PEG-PTX, and
SWNT-PTX (at the same PTX dose of 5 mg/kg for all three formulations, once every 6 days) i.v. into tumor-bearing mice. The mice
were observed daily for clinical symptoms and the tumor volume
was measured by a caliper every other day. As shown in Fig. 2,
a time-related increase in tumor volume was observed in the
control untreated group and SWNT vehicle only group in which the
tumors showed average fractional tumor volumes (V/V 0) of 10.1 F
1.7 and 9.8 F 2.0, respectively, on day 22. Taxol, PEG-PTX, and
DSPE-PEG-PTX treatment resulted in V/V 0 of 7.3 F 1.5 (P = 0.06
versus untreated), 8.0 F 1.6 (P = 0.18 versus untreated), and 8.6 F
0.9 (P = 0.33 versus untreated) on day 22, which represents tumor
growth inhibition (TGI) of 27.7%, 20.8%, and 14.9%, respectively. In
contrast, SWNT-PTX treatment resulted in a V/V 0 of 4.1 F 1.1 on
day 22 (P = 2.4  10 6 versus untreated, P = 0.00063 versus Taxol,
P = 0.00026 versus PEG-PTX, and P = 2.7  10 5 versus DSEP-PEGPTX), representing a TGI of 59.4%, which is significantly more
effective than Taxol, PEG-PTX, and DSPE-PEG-PTX.
To investigate the tumor suppression mechanism, we performed
TUNEL assay to examine the apoptosis level in the tumors (26)
from mice that received different treatments. Similar to untreated
tumor, Taxol-treated tumor showed only 2% to 3% of apoptotic
cells (Fig. 3A, 1st and 2nd rows; Supplementary Fig. S5A). In
contrast, high apoptosis level (f70%; P < 0.0001 versus untreated
and Taxol-treated tumors) was observed in SWNT-PTX–treated
tumor (Fig. 3A, 4th row; see Supplementary Fig. S5A for quantitative comparison), consistent with the improved TGI efficacy

Figure 3. Tumor staining for understanding of treatment effects. A, TUNEL (apoptosis assay) and 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI ; nuclear) costaining images
of 4T1 tumor slices from mice after different treatments indicated. Whereas tumors from untreated mice (1st row ), Taxol-treated mice (2nd row ), and plain SWNTtreated mice (3rd row ) showed few apoptotic cells, many cells in the tumor from SWNT-PTX–treated mice (4th row ) were undergoing apoptosis. B, Ki67 (proliferation
assay) and DAPI costaining images of tumor slices from mice after various treatments. 4th row, few proliferation active cells were observed in the tumor of mice
that received SWNT-PTX treatment. Tumors used in this study were taken from 4T1 tumor-bearing mice 12 d after initiation of treatment. Scale bar, 100 Am.

(Fig. 2). The Ki67 antibody staining method has been widely used
as a cell proliferation marker to stain proliferation active cells in
the G1, G2, and S phases of the cell cycle (27). We found that cell
proliferation in Taxol-treated tumor was as active as in untreated
tumor (Fig. 3B, 2nd row; see Supplementary Fig. S5B for quantitative comparison). In the SWNT-PTX–treated tumor case,
however, only f20% of proliferation active cells were noted
compared with the number in the untreated tumor (P < 0.0001
versus untreated and Taxol-treated tumors; Fig. 3B, 3rd row;
Supplementary Fig. S5B). As the control, plain SWNT without PTX
showed no effect to the tumors (Fig. 3, 3rd row), proving that the
treatment efficacy of SWNT-PTX is due to PTX carried into tumors
by nanotubes. Thus, both TUNEL staining and Ki67 staining results
clearly confirmed the treatment efficacy of SWNT-PTX by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of tumor cells.
To investigate the pharmacokinetics of various drug complexes,
we first measured blood circulation behaviors of PEGylated SWNTs
with and without PTX conjugation by Raman spectroscopic
detection of SWNTs in blood sample drawn from mice after
injection of SWNT and SWNT-PTX (see Materials and Methods).
We observed a significantly shortened circulation half-life of our
branch-PEGylated SWNT from f3.3 h to f1.1 h (circulation halflife was obtained by one-compartment first-order exponential
decay fitting; see Materials and Methods) after PTX conjugation
(Fig. 4A). This result was important and attributed to the high
hydrophobicity of conjugated PTX, reducing the biological
inertness of the PEGylated nanotubes in vivo and shortening the
blood circulation time. Blood circulation behaviors of the three
forms of PTX were measured using 3H-labeled PTX. Liquid
scintillation counting of 3H-PTX radioactivity of blood samples
collected from mice after injection showed circulation half-lives
of 18.8 F 1.5, 22.8 F 1.0, and 81.4 F 7.4 min for 3H-PTX injected
in Taxol, PEG-PTX, and SWNT-PTX, respectively (Fig. 4B; see
Supplementary Table S1 for complete pharmacokinetic data).
This clearly revealed that conjugation of PTX to PEGylated
SWNTs significantly increased the blood circulation time of PTX.
Interestingly, simple PEGylation of PTX, through imparted water

www.aacrjournals.org

solubility of PTX, still exhibited much shorted blood circulation
than PTX on PEGylated SWNTs. Note that for SWNT-PTX,
circulation curves of radiolabeled PTX measured by radioactivity (Fig. 4A and B, green curves) and the drug carrier SWNT
measured by Raman have consistent slopes (Fig. 4A, red curve),
suggesting that PTX and SWNT remained in a conjugated form
in the blood circulation stage, which is consistent to the relatively slow PTX releasing behavior of SWNT-PTX in mouse
serum (Supplementary Fig. S2). The minor difference in the absolute values could be due to systematic errors between two different methodologies.
To understand the tumor treatment efficacy of various PTX
formulations (i.e., SWNT-PTX, Taxol, and PEG-PTX), we investigated biodistribution of 3H-PTX in the tumor and various main
organs. We observed significant differences in the biodistribution
of PTX administrated in the three formulations of PTX (Fig. 4C and
D). Consistent with the blood circulation data (Fig. 4B), SWNT-PTX
showed noticeable PTX activity in blood at 2 h after injection,
whereas PTX levels in the blood were much lower in the Taxol
(P < 0.001) and PEG-PTX (P < 0.01) cases (Fig. 4C, inset). Differences in biodistributions of PTX in the three cases were the
most obvious at 2 h after injection, with much higher PTX signals
in the RES organs (liver/spleen) and intestine of mice in the SWNTPTX case than the two other cases (Fig. 4C).
Importantly, SWNT-PTX afforded much higher PTX uptake in
the tumor than Taxol and PEG-PTX. The tumor PTX levels in the
SWNT-PTX case were higher than those of Taxol and PEG-PTX by
10- and 6-fold, respectively, at 2 h after injection (Fig. 4C) and by
6- and 4-fold higher, respectively, at 24 h after injection (P < 0.001 in
all cases; Fig. 4D). The ability of higher drug delivery efficiency to
tumor by our PEGylated SWNTs was striking and directly
responsible for the higher tumor suppression efficacy of SWNTPTX than the other formulations. This suggests that to reach
similar tumor uptake of drug, much lower injected dose can be
used by SWNT delivery than Taxol, which is highly favorable for
lowering toxic side effect to normal organs and tissues. An
important gauge to drug delivery efficiency is the tumor-to-normal

organ/tissue PTX uptake ratios. We obtained significantly higher
tumor-to-normal organ/tissue PTX uptake ratios ( for tumor over
liver, spleen, muscle, and other organs examined) in the case of
SWNT-PTX than Taxol and PEG-PTX (except at 2 h after injection for spleen) at 2 and 24 h (Supplementary Table S2). This again
makes SWNT-PTX highly favorable for high tumor suppression
efficacy and low side effects.
We investigated the biodistribution of SWNTs injected as SWNTPTX conjugates into mice by using their intrinsic Raman scattering properties without relying on radiolabel or fluorescent label
(18, 28). We observed high uptake of SWNTs in the RESs (18–20),
including liver and spleen (Fig. 5A–C). Tumor uptake of SWNTPTX increased significantly from f1% ID/g at 30 min to f5% ID/g
at 2 h, indicating accumulation of SWNT-PTX during this
period through blood circulation (see Fig. 4B for circulation

curve). Tumor uptake of SWNTs at 4.7% ID/g (SD = 2.1%, n = 3)
was observed at 2 h after injection (Fig. 5B), reasonably consistent
with the f6.4% ID/g (SD = 1.1%, n = 3) PTX tumor uptake
(Fig. 5B), suggesting that SWNT-PTX was taken up by tumor
in a conjugated form. The SWNT biodistribution exhibited little
change from 2 h (Fig. 5B) to 24 h after injection (Fig. 5C), in
contrast to the biodistribution of radiolabeled PTX (Fig. 4C versus
D, green columns). This suggests that the dissociation of PTX from
SWNT carriers in vivo that resulted from in vivo cleavage of the
ester bond between SWNT and PTX is likely by carboxylesterases
(29–31).
We carried out micro-Raman imaging of SWNTs in tumor slices
on sacrificing mice treated by SWNT-PTX at 24 h after injection.
The tumor uptake of SWNTs was indeed confirmed by Raman
mapping of the SWNT characteristic G-band Raman peak at

interstitial space. As the control, no tumor retention of fluorescent
dye was observed in mice injected with free Alexa Fluor 488 at the
same dose (Fig. 5D, left).
Toxic side effects to normal organs and overall well being
have been the main problems of cancer chemotherapeutics.
By themselves, our well PEGylated SWNTs have been found
to be nontoxic to mice in vivo monitored over many months
(21, 22). We carried out a pilot toxicity study by treating healthy,
tumor-free BALB/c mice with Taxol and SWNT-PTX at the
same 5 mg/kg PTX dose once every 6 days. We observed neither
mortality nor noticeable body weight loss of the mice treated
with SWNT-PTX and Taxol compared with untreated control
group at this relatively low PTX dose and injection frequency
(Fig. 6A). Blood chemistry test was performed 24 days after
initiation of the treatment, showing no physiologically significant
difference among the three groups (Fig. 6B; Supplementary
Table S3). Furthermore, H&E-stained sections of the 25 organs
and organ systems were examined (Fig. 6C), without noticing
obvious abnormal damage in the main organs including the liver
and spleen that had high SWNT uptake, which was consistent
to the normal hepatic enzyme levels measured in the blood
chemistry test (Fig. 6B). The observed lack of obvious toxic side
effect was partly due to the low dose of PTX used as the maximum tolerable dose of PTX in the Taxol case f20 to 50 mg/kg
(32–34). Achieving tumor treatment efficacy by SWNT-PTX at a
PTX dose well below the toxic limit is owed to the ability of
drug delivery to tumors by SWNTs. However, further careful

studies, such as the hepatic macrophage function tests, are required to examine any potential near-term or long-term side effect
of SWNT-PTX.

Discussion
We have shown that SWNT delivery of PTX affords markedly
improved treatment efficacy over clinical Taxol, evidenced by its
ability of slowing down tumor growth at a low PTX dose. The
treatment effect is confirmed by tumor staining that reveals
significant apoptotic cells and few proliferation active cells in the
SWNT-PTX–treated tumor. The key reason for higher tumor
suppression efficacy of SWNT-PTX than Taxol and PEG-PTX is
the up to 10-fold higher tumor uptake of PTX afforded by SWNT
carriers, which is a remarkable result. This is directly responsible
for tumor suppression at a low dose of SWNT-PTX for the 4T1
tumor model normally resistant to PTX treatment (24).
Prolonged blood circulation and EPR effects are responsible for
significantly higher tumor uptake of PTX in the SWNT-PTX case
(6.4% ID/g at 2 h after injection) than Taxol (0.6% ID/g) and
PEG-PTX (1.1% ID/g). The poor water solubility of various cancer
therapeutic drugs limits their clinical applications. Cremophor
EL is a commonly used reagent to disperse PTX and other drugs
in saline for administration. However, its toxic effects have been
noted in both animal models and patients (35–38). Similar to
previous reports (39–44), we observe (Fig. 4B) short blood
circulation time for PTX in Taxol. Little PTX (<2% ID/g) in the

weight curves of mice that received different
treatments in the study (PTX dose,

was observed in all the groups. Five

chemistry data of untreated, Taxol-treated,

attention was paid to those hepatic-related
serum chemistries (which would reflect
liver damage or alternation of function),
including aspartate aminotransferase

alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos ), and
g-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT ),
without finding obvious abnormality for
SWNT-PTX–treated mice. The error bars
are based on three mice in each group.

In vivo Drug Delivery with Carbon Nanotubes

Taxol form remains circulating in the blood after only 11 min after
injection at the current 5 mg/kg injected dose (Fig. 4B). PTX in
Taxol is cleared from the blood and taken up by various organs
especially kidney and liver for rapid renal and fecal excretion with
very low tumor uptake (39–41, 43).
Branched PEGylation of PTX via similar ester linkage as in
SWNT-PTX conjugates affords water solubility of PTX. However, the blood circulation time is still short (PEG-PTX concentration diminished to <2% ID/g in f70 min after injection),
albeit longer than Taxol. PEG-PTX remains a relatively small
molecule that tends to be rapidly excreted via the kidney and
renal route, evidenced by the high kidney and urine signals of
radiolabeled PEG-PTX (data not shown). This leads to little
advantage of PEGylation of PTX over Taxol in tumor uptake and
treatment efficacy, as found here and by previous PTX PEGylation work (45).
The water solubility of our SWNT-PTX formulation favors
prolonged blood circulation. Nevertheless, the high hydrophobicity
of PTX reduces the hydrophilicity and biological inertness of
our branch PEG functionalized SWNTs, causing significantly
shortened blood circulation half-lives of the SWNT-PTX formulation (f1.1 h) compared with PEGylated SWNTs without PTX
attachment (f3.3 h; Fig. 4A). The higher hydrophobicity led to
increased nonspecific protein absorption on the nanotube conjugates, which accelerated the uptake by macrophages in RES organs.
Compared with PEG-PTX, SWNT-PTX exhibits finite lengths
(20–300 nm; mean, f100 nm; Supplementary Fig. S1), a factor
that favors long blood circulation because the average length of
the nanotubes exceeds the threshold for renal clearance (46).
Pharmacokinetics of materials with long blood circulation times
are typically desired for a drug delivery vehicle for tumor treatment
(2, 47, 48) to favor high tumor accumulation from the circulating blood through EPR effects. Note that our method of drug
delivery by PEGylated SWNTs should be readily applicable to a
wide range of hydrophobic or water-insoluble drugs. This could
lead to a general drug delivery strategy for potent but waterinsoluble molecules.
Tumor staining data clearly revealed apoptotic cells (Fig. 3A)
inside the tumor treated by SWNT-PTX. Nanotubes were observed
in the tumor vasculature as well as leaked out of the vessels
(Fig. 5D, left). Drug delivery to cancer cells through the tumor
vessel walls and interstitial space is desired for high tumor
treatment efficacy. SWNTs seemed to exhibit certain ability in
overcoming these barriers, which could be related to the quasi
one-dimensional shape of these materials. An interesting feature
of SWNTs is that the length of nanotubes (20–300 nm currently)
could be controlled more precisely to span various size regimens. This could allow for investigation of length effect of onedimensional materials to the tumor penetration and suppression
efficacy of drug complexes. This intriguing length effect will require
systematic exploration in the future.
PTX conjugation to PEGylated SWNTs clearly alters the
pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of PTX from Taxol and
PEG-PTX. The up to 10 times high tumor uptake of the drug
through SWNT-PTX and high tumor-to-normal organ/tissue PTX
uptake ratios strongly favor high tumor killing efficacy and low
toxicity to normal organs. High RES uptake is known for nanomaterials in general. The high uptake of SWNT-PTX in RES organs
such as liver and spleen (18, 22) could be a cause of concern
in terms of toxicity to these organs. Importantly, our biodistribution studies revealed relatively low PTX levels in the RES organs

www.aacrjournals.org

at later time points (2 and 24 h), differing from the SWNT
biodistribution (Fig. 5A–C). The difference between the biodistribution of SWNT and 3H-PTX (measured by radioactivity) suggests
rapid release of PTX from SWNT in the various organs and tissues
in vivo, resulted from in vivo cleavage of the ester linkage between
PTX and PEGylated SWNT most likely by carboxylesterases
especially those in the liver (29–31). We observed a significant
PTX accumulation but proportionally lower SWNT signal in the
intestine in the PTX-SWNT case at 30 min and 2 h after injection
(Fig. 5A and B). We also detected strong PTX signal in the feces
even at only 30 min after injection (data not shown). These data
suggested that SWNT-PTX taken up by the RES organs was
dissociated via ester cleavage for release for excretion. Unlike the
SWNT carriers, which are excreted gradually in weeks or even
months (22), the dissociated PTX drug molecules can be rapidly
excreted via both feces and urine without causing noticeable
toxicity. Taken together, the uptake of drug-nanomaterial complexes by RES could serve as a scavenger system to eliminate toxic
drugs as well as carriers.
The maximum tolerable dose of Taxol for BALB/c mice is
reported to be in the range of 20 to 50 mg/kg (32–34). Achieving
tumor growth suppression by SWNT-PTX at 5 mg/kg dose once
every 6 days suggests the promise of SWNT drug delivery for
effective cancer treatment with low side effects. More importantly,
our water-soluble SWNT-PTX formulation is Cremophor-free.
SWNTs have shown to be safe at least in mouse models (21, 22).
The amount of SWNTs required to give 5 mg/kg PTX is only
f4 mg/kg compared with f420 mg/kg Cremophor in the Taxol
case for the same PTX dose. Further, the same SWNT conjugation
strategy applies to many other water-insoluble drugs.
SWNTs are highly promising for drug delivery due to several
factors. These materials can now be functionalized to a sufficient
degree to facilitate nearly complete excretion of SWNTs from mice
over time (22). The chemical composition (purely carbon) of
carbon nanotubes is among the safest in the inorganic nanomaterials, many of which such as quantum dots have heavy metal
compositions. The unique one-dimensional structure and tunable
length provide an ideal platform to investigate size and shape
effects in vivo. Lastly, unlike the conventional organic drug carriers,
the intrinsic spectroscopic properties of nanotubes, including
Raman and photoluminescence, can provide valuable means of
tracking, detecting, and imaging to understand the in vivo behavior
and drug delivery efficacy in vivo. Taken together, carbon nanotubes are promising materials for potential multimodality cancer
therapy and imaging.
To our knowledge, this is the first successful report that carbon
nanotubes are used as drug delivery vehicles to achieve in vivo
tumor treatment efficacy with mice. This opens up further exploration of biomedical applications of novel carbon nanomaterials
with animals for potential translation into the clinic in the future.
It is important to note that nanotube functionalization chemistry
largely determines the efficacy of SWNT drug delivery, as our
various other functionalization attempts have failed to give satisfactory treatment efficacy in other experiments. The treatment
efficacy of SWNT-based drug delivery vehicles can be further
improved because the current functionalization scheme is not
yet fully optimized. Targeting ligands on nanotubes for tumortargeted drug delivery is also expected to further enhance treatment efficacy. The one-dimensional shape and length of nanotubes
easily allow for targeting ligands, drugs, and multiple molecules for
synergistic effects.
