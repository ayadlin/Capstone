Abstract
Overexpression of Bcl-2 family proteins has been found in a
variety of aggressive human carcinomas, including pancreatic
cancer, suggesting that specific agents targeting Bcl-2 family
proteins would be valuable for pancreatic cancer therapy. We
have previously reported that TW-37, a small-molecule
inhibitor of Bcl-2 family proteins, inhibited cell growth and
induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer. However, the precise
role and the molecular mechanism of action of TW-37 have
not been fully elucidated. In our current study, we found that
TW-37 induces cell growth inhibition and S-phase cell cycle
arrest, with regulation of several important cell cycle–related
genes like p27, p57, E2F-1, cdc25A, CDK4, cyclin A, cyclin D1,
and cyclin E. The cell growth inhibition was accompanied by
increased apoptosis with concomitant attenuation of Notch-1,
Jagged-1, and its downstream genes such as Hes-1 in vitro and
in vivo. We also found that down-regulation of Notch-1 by
small interfering RNA or ;-secretase inhibitors before TW-37
treatment resulted in enhanced cell growth inhibition and
apoptosis. Our data suggest that the observed antitumor
activity of TW-37 is mediated through a novel pathway
involving inactivation of Notch-1 and Jagged-1. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most aggressive cancers
with a very poor prognosis. More than 33,000 patients die of this
deadly disease every year in the United States (1). The vast majority
of patients present with gross metastases or micrometastases
requiring effective drug therapies. However, conventional chemotherapy has shown only a minimal survival benefit when combined
with surgical resection (1). This disappointing outcome suggests
that new and alternative approaches to the control of cancer are
critically needed. Pancreatic cancer has been shown to overexpress
Bcl-2 and its family members (2–4). Therefore, blockade of Bcl-2
activity should become a novel therapeutic strategy for pancreatic
cancer. Many groups have been working to develop anticancer
drugs that block the function of Bcl-2 members (3, 5–7). TW-37,

a recently developed small-molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2, targets
multiple members of the Bcl-2 family and attenuates activation
of Bcl-2. TW-37 was designed to target the elongated groove of
antiapoptotic proteins that normally bind the BH3 domain of
proapoptotic effectors such as Bid, Bax, Bim, and others (8). We
have found that TW-37 inhibits the growth of a variety of cancer
cells, including breast, prostate, lymphoma, and pancreatic cancer
(8–11). However, the exact mechanism of action of TW-37 as an
antitumor agent has not yet been fully established.
It is well documented that Bcl-2 functions through heterodimerization with proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family to prevent
mitochondrial pore formation and prevent cytochrome c release
and initiation of apoptosis (12). However, there are more evidences
showing that Bcl-2 may play an oncogenic role through survival
pathways other than its function at the mitochondrial membrane.
It has been reported that Bcl-2 activates nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB)
by a signaling mechanism that involves Raf-1/MEKK-1–mediated
activation of IKKh (13). Mortenson and colleagues have shown that
overexpression of Bcl-2 increased the activity of AKT and IKK as
well as NF-nB transcriptional activity in pancreatic cancer (2).
Kumar and colleagues found that Bcl-2–induced tumor cell
proliferation and tumor cell invasion were significantly mediated
by interleukin-8 (14). Recently, Tucker and colleagues reported that
Bcl-2 overexpression leading to maintenance of cyclin D1a
expression may occur through p38 mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK)–mediated signaling pathways in human lymphoma
cell lines (15). Moreover, down-regulation of Bcl-2 also could
modulate the expression of anhydrase IX (CAIX), vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and pAkt in prostate cancer
cell lines (16). In addition, Bcl-2 induces VEGF expression in
neovascular endothelial cells through a signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)–mediated pathway (17). These
results provide evidence in support of the new functions of Bcl-2 in
cancer biology that is beyond its classic role in cell survival (17).
Because Notch signaling also plays important roles in the
cellular developmental pathway, including proliferation and
apoptosis, alterations in Notch signaling are associated with
tumorigenesis (18). Notch-1 has been reported to cross-talk with
other pathways, such as AKT and NF-nB (19–22). Thus, given the
potential role for Bcl-2 in regulating NF-nB and the known pathway
from Notch to NF-nB, we hypothesized that overexpression of Bcl-2
could lead to the activation of Notch signaling pathway in
pancreatic cancer and, as such, these pathways would be targeted
by the Bcl-2 inhibitor TW-37. Thus, in the present study, we
investigated whether TW-37–induced inhibition of pancreatic
cancer cell growth could be attributed to Bcl-2 activity and its
associated signaling, especially inactivation of Notch-1 activity.

We found that the inactivation of Bcl-2 by TW-37 down-regulated
the Notch-1 activity, resulting in the inhibition of the growth of
pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) xenograft model.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and experimental reagents. Human pancreatic cancer cell
lines AsPC-1, BxPC-3, Colo-357, HPAC, L3.6pl, MIAPaCa, and PANC-1 were
used in this study. Primary antibodies for Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, Jagged-1,
Notch-1, Hes-1, cyclin A, cyclin B, cyclin D1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, FoxM1,
p21, p57, and E2F-1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All
secondary antibodies were obtained from Pierce. g-Secretase inhibitors
L-685,458 and DAPT were obtained from Calbiochem.
TW-37. Design, synthesis, purification, and chemical characterization of
N-[(2-tert-butyl-benzenesulfonyl)-phenyl]-2,3,4-trihydroxy-5-(2-isopropylbenzyl)-benzamide (TW-37) are described in detail by Wang and colleagues
(11); in the inactive congener TW-37a, all three hydroxyl groups in the
polyphenolic ring have been substituted with a methyl group, resulting in a
100-fold loss of binding (11).
Cell growth inhibition studies by WST-1 assay. The pancreatic cancer
cells (5  103) were seeded in a 96-well culture plate. After 12 h, cells were
treated with various concentrations of TW-37 for 24, 48, and 72 h. After
incubation, the cell growth inhibition studies were performed by WST-1
assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In addition to the above
assay, we have also done clonogenic assay for assessing the effects of
treatment as shown below.
Clonogenic assay. To test the survival of cells treated with TW-37, BxPC3 and Colo-357 cells were plated (50,000–100,000 per well) in a six-well plate
and incubated overnight at 37jC. After 72-h exposure to various
concentrations of TW-37, the cells were subjected to a clonogenic assay
as described before (23).
Flow cytometry and cell cycle analysis. The TW-37–treated cells, as
indicated earlier, were trypsinized, collected, and washed twice with PBS.
Cell pellets were fixed in 70% ethanol and the percentage of cells in different
phases of the cell cycle was analyzed as described before (24).
Histone/DNA ELISA for detection of apoptosis. The Cell Death
Detection ELISA Kit was used for assessing apoptosis according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, after TW-37 treatment, the cells were lysed
and the cell lysates were overlaid and incubated in microtiter plate modules
coated with anti-histone antibody for detection of apoptosis as described
earlier (10).
Annexin V assay. Characterization of apoptosis was carried out after
propidium iodide and Annexin V–FITC staining with apoptosis detection
kit (Pharmingen) followed by flow cytometric analysis after 48 h of
500 nmol/L TW-37 treatment of BxPC-3 and Colo-357 according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Hoechst staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferasemediated nick end labeling assay for detection of apoptosis. Cells
were treated with TW-37 for 72 h, as described above. After treatment,
cells were washed with cold PBS and fixed in ethanol for 1 h. The cells were
then stained with 5 Ag/mL Hoechst for 30 min and visualized under a
fluorescence microscope. Bright condensed, punctuate, or granular nuclei
were considered apoptotic. Moreover, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferasemediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) was assayed with a commercial
apoptosis detection kit (Promega Corp.).
Western blot analysis. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer by incubating
for 20 min at 4jC. The protein concentration was determined using the
Bio-Rad assay system (Bio-Rad). Total proteins were fractionated using
SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane for Western
blotting as described earlier (10).
Real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis for gene expression
studies. The total RNA from treated cells was isolated by Trizol (Invitrogen)
and purified by RNeasy Mini Kit and RNase-free DNase Set (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The primers used in the PCR
reaction for Notch-1, Jagged-1, Hes-1, p21, p27, p57, E2F-1, Survivin, Cdc25A,

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (7). April 1, 2009

FoxM1, and h-actin were described before (19, 24). Real-time PCR
amplifications were performed as described earlier (24).
Immunofluorescence staining. The cells were plated on coverslips in
each well of an eight-well chamber for 24 h. After treatment of TW-37 for
72 h, cells were then fixed with paraformaldehyde for 15 min, rinsed with
PBS, and incubated with 5% goat serum for 30 min. The cells were then
incubated with anti–Notch-1 and anti–Jagged-1 antibody for 2 h,
respectively. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with FITCconjugated secondary antibody for 45 min and washed with PBS. Cell
images were observed under a fluorescent microscope.
Plasmids and transfections. Bcl-2 siRNA, Notch-1 siRNA, and siRNA
control were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The Bcl-2 cDNA
plasmid was generated as described earlier (25). The Notch-1 cDNA plasmid
encoding the Notch-1 intracellular domain was a kind gift from L. Miele
(Department of Biopharmaceutical Sciences and Cancer Center, University
of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL; ref. 26). Human pancreatic cancer cells,
BxPC-3 and Colo-357, were transfected with the Bcl-2 plasmid using
Lipofectamine 2000 as described earlier (27). Cells were stably transfected
with human Notch-1 ICN or vector alone (pcDNA3) and maintained under
neomycin selection.
Colo-357 xenografts. Four-week-old female ICR-SCID mice were
obtained from Taconic Laboratory. The mice were adapted to animal
housing and Colo-357 xenografts were developed as described earlier (10).
Using this model, we have previously shown the antitumor activity of TW37. Tumor tissues harvested from this experiment were used for histologic,
immunohistochemical, and Western blotting analyses. All studies involving
mice were performed under Animal Investigation Committee–approved
protocols.
Immunohistochemical expression of Ki67, proliferating cell nuclear
antigen, and phospho-p65. The expression of Ki67, proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA; proliferative marker), and phospho-p65 was
detected in histologic sections of tumor xenografts as described before
(28). Apoptotic cells were identified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining as recommended by the manufacturer (Chemicon, Inc.).
Statistical analysis. Data are represented as mean F SD for the absolute
values or percentage of controls as indicated in the vertical axis legend of
figures. The statistical significance of differential findings between
experimental groups and control was determined by the Student’s t test
as implemented by GraphPad StatMate software (GraphPad Software, Inc.).
P values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
Effects of TW-37 on the viability of pancreatic cancer cells.
The baseline expression of Bcl-2 family proteins was determined in
a panel of human pancreatic cancer cell lines that included AsPC-1,
BxPC-3, Colo-357, HPAC, L3.6pl, MIA PaCa, and PANC-1. The
results showed that Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 were frequently but
differentially expressed in different human pancreatic cancer cell
lines (Supplementary Fig. S1B). BxPC-3 and Colo-357 were chosen
for this study based on their constitutive levels of Bcl-2 family
proteins. Viability of BxPC-3 and Colo-357 cells treated with TW-37
was determined by the WST assay, and the data are presented in
Fig. 1. The treatment of pancreatic cancer cells for 1 to 3 days with
250, 500, and 750 nmol/L of TW-37 resulted in cell growth
inhibition in a dose- and time-dependent manner in both BxPC-3
and Colo-357 pancreatic cancer cell lines (Fig. 1A). In addition, we
have also tested the effects of treatment on cell viability by
clonogenic assay as shown below.
Inhibition of cell growth/survival by clonogenic assay. To
determine the effect of TW-37 on cell growth, cells were treated
with TW-37 and assessed for cell viability by clonogenic assay.

Inhibition of Cell Growth by TW-37

Figure 1. Effect of TW-37 on pancreatic cancer cell growth. A, dose and time responses of TW-37 on growth of pancreatic cancer cells. Cells were seeded in 96-well
plates at 5,000 per well and treated with varied concentrations of TW-37 for different times. After treatment, cell densities were determined by the WST assay.

and C). Overall, the results from clonogenic assay was consistent
with the WST data as shown in Fig. 1A, suggesting that TW-37
inhibited cell growth in BxPC-3 and Colo-357 pancreatic cancer
cells. Next, we examined whether the inhibition of cell growth was
also accompanied by the induction of apoptosis induced by TW-37.
TW-37 induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cell lines. To
quantitatively measure apoptotic cell death after different treatment, we conducted a histone/DNA enzyme-linked immunosorbent apoptosis assay. We found that TW-37 induced apoptosis in
a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). To confirm this
result, we also used other methods to detect apoptosis: BxPC-3 and
Colo-357 cells were treated with 500 nmol/L TW-37 for 48 h. By
staining cells with Annexin V–FITC and propidium iodide, we
found that the percentage of apoptotic cells increased from 5% to
6% in the control to 12% to 14% in both BxPC-3 and Colo-357 cell
lines (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Our TUNEL assay also showed that
TW-37 induced apoptosis in BxPC-3 and Colo-357 cells (Fig. 2B).
In addition, by Hoechst staining for testing apoptotic cells, we
observed more bright condensed and granular stained nuclei in
TW-37–treated cells compared with control (Fig. 2C), suggesting
that TW-37 could induce apoptosis.
TW-37 induced S-phase arrest. To further investigate the effect
of TW-37 on cell growth in more detail, we analyzed the effects of

500 nmol/L TW-37 on the cell cycle distribution of BxPC-3 and
Colo-357 cells. The cell cycle distribution was monitored by flow
cytometry ( fluorescence-activated cell sorting) analysis after
propidium iodide staining of the cellular DNA. As seen in
Fig. 2D, in comparison with untreated control cells, TW-37 induced
an accumulation of cells in the S-phase fractions. The S-phase
fraction increased from 25.34% in control cells to 45.89% and from
24.49% in control cells to 41.41% in TW-37–treated BxPC-3 cells
and Colo-357 cells, respectively.
To further characterize the S-phase arrest, we examined the level
of expression of several known S-phase cell cycle regulatory factors.
Consistent with cell cycle arrest, the expression of cyclin A, E, D1,
and CDK4 levels was found to be decreased, whereas p21 and p57
expression was increased (Fig. 3A and C), suggesting the
mechanistic roles of these molecules during TW-37–induced cell
cycle progression and cell cycle arrest by TW-37. To further confirm
our data, we found that the expression of cell cycle regulatory
factors involved in cell proliferation and survival, such as E2F-1,
Survivin, and cdc25A, was down-regulated in TW-37–treated cells
(Fig. 3A–C). This observation suggests that the S-phase arrest by
TW-37 is in part due to profound alterations in the expression of
positive and negative regulatory cell cycle–related proteins.
To further understand the molecular mechanism involved in

30 min and visualized under a fluorescence microscope. Bright condensed, punctuate, or granular nuclei were considered apoptotic. We observed more bright

TW-37–induced apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells, alterations
in the cell survival pathway were investigated. Because Notch
signaling plays important roles in the cellular proliferation and
apoptosis, we investigated whether TW-37 could regulate Notch
signaling pathway.
Down-regulation of the Notch-1 expression by TW-37. Notch1, Jagged-1, and Hes-1 mRNA and protein expression in BxPC-3 and
Colo-357 cell lines treated with TW-37 for 72 hours were assessed
using real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and Western
blotting analysis, respectively. We found that Notch-1 (ICN) and
Jagged-1 were down-regulated by TW-37 in both cell lines (Fig. 4A).
To confirm our results, we also did immunofluorescent staining.
Indeed, we observed a lower level of Notch-1 protein in the nucleus
and Jagged-1 in the cytoplasm in the TW-37–treated cells (Fig. 4B).
We also found that the expression of the Jagged-1 gene at the
mRNA level was down-regulated after TW-37 treatment in both
the cell lines, suggesting transcriptional inactivation of Jagged-1

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (7). April 1, 2009

gene expression in pancreatic cancer cells (Fig. 4C). However,
the Notch-1 mRNA level was not affected by TW-37 in both the cell
lines. Interestingly, Hes-1 mRNA and protein expression were
decreased in Colo-357 cell lines but not in BxPC-3 cells (Fig. 4C).
The mechanisms of such differences need further investigation in
the future. To further confirm this result, we also treated BxPC-3
and Colo-357 cells with another Bcl-2 inhibitor, ApoG2. We found
that ApoG2 also inhibited the expression of Notch and Jagged-1
(Supplementary Fig. S1D).
Down-regulation of Notch-1 expression by small interfering
RNA (siRNA) or g-secretase inhibitor (GSI) potentiates TW-37–
induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis. Next, we observed
that down-regulation of Notch-1 expression by siRNA or GSI
significantly inhibited cell growth in TW-37 treated cells (Figs. 4D
and 5A). Notch-1 siRNA-transfected cells were significantly more
sensitive to spontaneous and TW-37–induced apoptosis (Fig. 5B).
However, overexpression of Notch-1 by cDNA transfection rescued

Inhibition of Cell Growth by TW-37

TW-37–induced cell growth inhibition and abrogated TW-37–
induced apoptosis to a certain degree (Fig. 5B).
Overexpression of Bcl-2 by cDNA transfection increased
Notch-1 expression in cancer cells. To detect whether Bcl-2
regulates the Notch-1 expression, we did Bcl-2 cDNA transfection
experiment. Indeed, we found that overexpression of Bcl-2 by
cDNA transfection increased Notch-1 ICN expression. However,
down-regulation of Bcl-2 by siRNA inhibited the Notch-1
expression in BxPC-3 and Colo-357 cells (Fig. 5D). We found
similar results in PC-3 prostate cancer cells and MCF-7 breast
cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B), suggesting that Bcl-2
regulates Notch-1 activity in many different cell lines.
Effect of TW-37 on Notch-1 expression in vivo. We have
previously found that TW-37 treatment significantly inhibited
pancreatic tumor growth in vivo (10). TW-37 also did not show any
toxicity or caused any loss in the body weight of the animals during
the course of the treatment (up to 20 days). To further investigate
whether TW-37 could down-regulate Notch-1 in vivo, we examined
the Notch-1 expression in tumor tissues obtained from tumorbearing mouse treated with TW-37 as published earlier (10).
Western blot analysis showed that the expression level of Notch-1
was significantly lower in tumors from the TW-37–treated mice

than those from vehicle-treated control mice (Fig. 6C), suggesting
that TW-37 could down-regulate Notch-1 in vivo, similar to those
observed in vitro. In addition, we found that the expression of
Jagged-1 and Notch-1 downstream target gene, Hes-1, was also
down-regulated in TW-37–treated tumors (Fig. 6C).
The PCNA and Ki-67 nuclear labeling indices, as determined by
immunohistochemical staining, were decreased in the TW-37–
treated tumors compared with control tumors (Fig. 6D), suggesting
inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. In our earlier report, we
showed that TW-37 could down-regulate the DNA-binding activity
of NF-nB in vitro. To determine whether TW-37 could affect the
NF-jB gene in vivo, we also examined the expression of p65 and
the phosphorylated form of p65 (active NF-nB) in tumor tissues.
We found that the expression of p65 and phospho-p65 was downregulated in TW-37–treated animal tissues (Fig. 6C and D). To
determine TW-37 induces apoptosis, we assessed activation of
poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP), an important mediator of
apoptosis, in animal tissues by Western immunoblotting. We found
the increased expression of cleaved PARP in TW-37–treated animal
tissues. In addition, significant differences in the percentage of
TUNEL-positive cells were also noted in tumors derived from the
TW-37 treatment group relative to control group (Fig. 6B). These

Figure 4. Effect of TW-37 on Notch-1 expression in human pancreatic cancer cells. A, the expression of Notch-1, its ligand Jagged-1, and its target gene Hes-1 was
detected by Western blotting. B, the Colo-357 pancreatic cancer cells treated with 500 nmol/L TW-37 for 72 h were subjected to immunofluorescent staining using
anti–Notch-1 antibody and anti–Jagged-1 antibody. C, the Notch-1 mRNA level was detected in BxPC-3 and Colo-357 cell lines treated with TW-37 for 72 h as
measured by real-time RT-PCR. D, top, GSI (L-685,458 and DAPT ) significantly inhibited Colo-357 cell growth. TW-37 plus GSI inhibited Colo-357 cell growth to a
greater degree compared with TW-37. Bottom, the expression of Notch-1 was detected by Western blotting to check the GSI efficacy of down-regulation of
Notch-1.

results are consistent with our in vitro data showing that TW-37 is
a powerful agent for the inhibition of cell growth and induction
of apoptosis, which is mediated by inhibition of Bcl-2 family of
proteins and its downstream genes, especially Notch-1 and NF-jB.

Discussion
The Bcl-2 family of proteins plays critical roles in human
cancers, including pancreatic cancer. The activation of Bcl-2 has
been shown to enhance tumor growth, invasion, motility, tumor
spreading and metastasis, and inhibition of apoptosis. The
overexpression of Bcl-2 family proteins in pancreatic cancer may
also play important roles in resistance to a wide spectrum of
chemotherapeutic agents (29). Therefore, identification of an
inhibitor targeting Bcl-2 family of proteins is likely to provide a
therapeutic benefit for pancreatic cancer. Our laboratory and
others have extensively studied a number of small-molecule
inhibitors such as gossypol, apogossypolone, as well as TW-37 for
their antitumor activity in various cancers (4, 8, 10, 30, 31). The
present study shows that TW-37 inhibits tumor growth and induces

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (7). April 1, 2009

apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells, which was partly mediated
through inactivation of Notch-1 and NF-nB signal pathways that
are downstream of Bcl-2.
TW-37, a recently developed small-molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2, is
capable of antagonizing the function of pan-Bcl-2 family and
thereby may have greater therapeutic potential as an entirely new
class of antitumor agent. We have found that TW-37 inhibits the
growth of a variety of cancer cells, including pancreatic cancer cells
(8, 10, 11). Here, we investigated the mechanism by which TW-37
elicits its biological effects on pancreatic cancer cells. In this study,
we used two human pancreatic cancer cell lines, BxPC-3 and Colo357. Both cell lines have high expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1.
We found that TW-37 was capable of inducing significant growth
inhibition in both BxPC-3 and Colo-357 cells as detected by the
WST assay and the clonogenic assay. Moreover, TW-37 also induced
apoptotic cell death in both cell lines, suggesting that blocking
Bcl-2 is sufficient to trigger apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells
overexpressing these molecules. To further elucidate the mechanism of action, we detected whether cell cycle arrest was related to
the cell growth inhibition. Indeed, we found that TW-37 increased

Inhibition of Cell Growth by TW-37

cell population in the S phase. Moreover, we observed a marked
decrease in cyclin D1, cyclin A, and Cdk4 and the increased
expression of CdkI proteins, including p21CIP and p57KIP2, in
TW-37–treated cells.
Recent reports have shown that Bcl-2 may play an oncogenic
role by regulating important proteins in the survival pathway, such
as AKT, NF-nB, MAPK, and STAT3 (2, 15, 17). It has been reported
that AKT and NF-nB cross-talk with Notch-1 (20–22). We have
reported that Bcl-2 regulated the NF-nB activity in pancreatic
cancer (10). In this study, we further tested whether Bcl-2 could
also regulate NF-nB upstream signaling pathway, namely Notch-1.
Indeed, we found that TW-37 inhibits the activation of Notch-1 and
its ligand Jagged-1 in vitro and in vivo in pancreatic cancer. We also
found that TW-37 inhibited the expression of the Notch-1 target
gene Hes-1. Recently, it has been reported that the Notch pathway
is known to play critical roles in the processes of tumor cell
proliferation and apoptosis in pancreatic cancer (18). Therefore,
TW-37–mediated cell growth inhibition could be partly mediated
via inactivation of Notch-1 activity. Indeed, we found that downregulation of Notch-1 by siRNA or GSI together with TW-37
treatment inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis to a greater

degree in pancreatic cancer cells compared with TW-37 treatment
alone. In view of these findings, we strongly believe that
inactivation of Bcl-2 by TW-37 results in the down-regulation
of Notch-1 and subsequently inactivates NF-nB, which are believed
to be mechanistically linked with TW-37–induced apoptotic
processes.
Recently, it has been documented that activation of Notch-1
leads to the activation of NF-nB, which has been shown to be
activated in a variety of cancers (22). Increasing evidence of
dysregulated NF-nB–associated pathways has been found in
various human pancreatic cancer cell lines and primary tumors,
which supports the role of NF-nB in pancreatic cancer (32). In our
previous study, we found that TW-37 inhibits NF-nB activation in
pancreatic cancer. In this study, our results show, for the first time,
that NF-nB activity is significantly inhibited in the tumors of
TW-37–treated animals compared with untreated controls. Moreover, TW-37 treatment significantly inhibited pancreatic cancer cell
growth in vivo in the SCID xenograft model (10), which could in
part be attributed to decreased proliferation as evidenced by
reduced Ki-67 and PCNA immunoreactivity in the tumors of
TW-37–treated animals.

NS+TW , TW-37+Notch-1 siRNA; NP, Notch-1 plasmid; TW+NP, TW-37+Notch-1 plasmid. A, down-regulation of Notch-1 by siRNA significantly inhibited BxPC-3 and
Colo-357 cell growth. TW-37 plus Notch-1 siRNA inhibited cell growth to a greater degree compared with TW-37 alone. B, pancreatic cancer cell death induced by
Notch-1 siRNA and TW-37. Notch-1 siRNA–transfected cells were significantly more sensitive to spontaneous and TW-37–induced apoptosis. C, the expression of
Notch-1 was detected by Western blotting to check the Notch-1 plasmid transfection efficacy. D, Notch-1 and Hes-1 expression was up-regulated by Bcl-2 cDNA.
However, Notch-1 and Hes-1 expression was down-regulated by Bcl-2 siRNA.

were stained with antibodies to

In summary, we presented experimental evidence that strongly
supports the role of TW-37 as an antitumor agent. On the basis of
our results, we propose a hypothetical pathway by which TW-37
inhibits cell growth of pancreatic cancer cells, partly mediated
through inactivation of Notch-1 and NF-nB signaling pathways
(Supplementary Fig. S3). However, further in-depth studies are
needed to ascertain the precise molecular regulation of Bcl-2,
Notch-1, and FoxM1 and their cross-talks with NF-nB in
elucidating the role of TW-37 in cell growth inhibition and
apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells and its antitumor activity in
animal models before translating our findings for the treatment of
human pancreatic cancer.
