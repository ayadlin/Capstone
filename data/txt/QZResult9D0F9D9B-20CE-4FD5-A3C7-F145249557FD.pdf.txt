BACKGROUND. Second malignant neoplasms are a serious complication after successful treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Although
treatment intensity and outcome were not comparable, with improvements in
survival it is important to evaluate the rate and the type of second neoplasms in
adults with ALL.

METHODS. The data from the GET-LALA group were analyzed. A cohort of 1494
patients, aged 15 to 60 years and enrolled in 2 successive multicenter protocols
between 1987 and 2002, was observed to determine the incidence of second neoplasms and associated risk factors. The median follow-up from diagnosis was
6 years.

RESULTS. By February 2005 secondary or concomitant neoplasms were documen1

tumors (1 lung cancer, 1 tongue carcinoma, 1 thymoma, 1 condrosarcoma, 1 histiocytosis). Neoplasms developed 0.5 to 13.8 years (median, 4.5 years) after the

CONCLUSIONS. The data document that adult ALL survivors are at an increased
risk of later malignancy. The risk of secondary or concomitant neoplasm
appeared higher than that of childhood ALL previously reported in the literature.
Considering the low survival rate of this large unselected adult ALL cohort (32%

treatment results.1–7 However, patients who have
received cytotoxic therapy with chemotherapy drugs
and/or radiotherapy are at risk for long-term complications from their treatment, especially the occurrence of a second cancer. Second neoplasms are a
known complication of chemotherapy and irradiation
treatment for patients with Hodgkin disease and nonHodgkin lymphoma,8,9 and they have also been
reported after SCT.10–12 Although a causal link has not
been proven, these neoplasms are thought to be a
direct consequence of mutational events caused by
cytotoxic therapy. Both ionizing radiation and many,
but not all, chemotherapy drugs alter cellular DNA.
Such an alteration of DNA might involve a single base
change, deletion or inactivation of a growth suppressor gene, or changes in the expression of certain critical oncogenes or growth factor receptor genes.
In this setting, second malignant neoplasms are
a serious complication after successful treatment of
childhood ALL. Secondary malignant neoplasms
have been reported especially in the context of
cranial irradiation and administration of epipophyllotoxins. Long-term cumulative incidences of second
malignancies have been estimated between 1.5% and
5.9%.13–19 In a study of T-cell lineage ALL the incidence reached 20%.20 The incidence of secondary
brain tumors was particularly high and strongly
linked to cranial irradiation.14 Host factors seem also
to play a role since a high incidence of secondary
brain tumors was found in heterozygotes for thiopurine methyltransferase that received 6 mercaptopurine
(6-MP) during cranial irradiation.21
To our knowledge, no study has investigated the
incidence of malignant neoplasms after treatment of
adult ALL. In this study we retrospectively analyzed
data from the LALA Group database to determine the
occurrence and type of secondary neoplasms among
adults with ALL treated by 1 of the LALA protocols
since 1987 and to identify potential risk factors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
Between 1987 and 2002, 1494 adults (aged 15–60
years) with previously untreated newly diagnosed Bor T-cell lineage ALL were enrolled in the LALA multicenter trials (LALA-87 and LALA-94) and included
in the current study. The male-to-female ratio was
1.7 and the median age at diagnosis was 33 years.
Patient Subgroups
In both trials patients were stratified and randomized
into well-defined subgroups. In the LALA-87 trial,
postremission treatment was assigned according to

in 3 groups: patients 40 years with an HLA-identical sibling were scheduled to receive allogeneic SCT;
patients older than 50 years received consolidation
and maintenance chemotherapy associated with
central nervous system (CNS)-positive prophylaxis;
patients younger than 50 years who were not eligible
for allogeneic SCT were randomly allocated to either
maintenance chemotherapy or autologous SCT.1 In
the LALA-94 trial patients were stratified by risk
groups (Table 1). Standard-risk ALL comprised all Tcell lineage ALL patients achieving complete remission (CR) after 1 course of chemotherapy and B-cell
lineage ALL patients defined by the absence of CNSpositive (CNS1) ALL, the absence of Philadelphia
chromosome (Ph1), t(4;11), t(1;19), or other abnormalities involving 11q23 rearrangements, a white blood
cell (WBC) count <30 3 109/L, an immunophenotype characterized by CD101/CD191, or CD201/
CD191 and the absence of myeloid markers (My),
and achievement of CR after 1 course of chemotherapy. High-risk ALL was defined as nonstandard-risk
ALL without Ph1 or CNS involvement. Patients in
whom any phenotypic and/or karyotypic analyses
could not be performed because of marrow fibrosis
were systematically included in this group. Patients
with Ph1 and/or BCR-ABL 1 ALL constituted a specific group; those with evidence of CNS leukemia at

The cumulative doses of the important treatment
elements are listed in Table 2. Cyclophosphamide,
anthracyclines, vincristine, methotrexate, cytarabine,
and L-asparaginase were part of the treatment of all
patients. Major treatment changes between the trials
mainly concerned anthracyclines, vincristine, and
intravenous methotrexate that were given at higher
dosages in the LALA-87 trial, and cytarabine and
cyclophosphamide that were administered at higher
dosages in the LALA-94 for patients receiving only
chemotherapy.

FIGURE 1. Schedules of the trials LALA-87 and LALA-94. In the LALA-87
regimen maintenance chemotherapy consisted of a modified L10 regimen for
8 cycles of 64 days, spaced by 1 week. On cycles 1, 3, 5, and 7, PDN was
administered 60 mg/m2 orally on Days 1 through 8; VCR 1.5 mg/m2 intravenously (i.v.) on Days 1 and 8; anthracycline previously assigned, ie, DNR 60
mg/m2 i.v. on Day 15 or RBZ 120 mg/m2 i.v. on Day 15; followed by 6MP
60 mg/m2 orally on Days 28 through 54; MTX 15 mg/m2 orally on Days 35,
42, 49, and 56, and dactinomycin 1000 gamma/m2 i.v. on Day 64. On cycles
2, 4, 6, and 8, PDN was administered 60 mg/m2 orally on Days 1 through 8;
VCR 1.5 mg/m2 i.v. on Days 1 and 8; continuous passive motion 800 mg/m2
i.v. and carmustine 80 mg/m2 on Day 15; 6MP 60 mg/m2 orally on Days 28
through 54; MTX 15 mg/m2 orally on Days 35, 42, 49, and 56, and dactinomycin 1000 gamma/m2 i.v. on Day 64. In the LALA-94 regimen, maintenance chemotherapy consisted of 9 courses (Days 75, 90, 220, 304, 388,
and Months 16, 20, 24, 28) combining MTX 1500 mg/m2 i.v. on Day 1 with

Statistical Methods
Clinical and biological data were abstracted from the
patients’ hospital charts and from the GET-LALA
group database. These included: age, sex, white
blood cell (WBC) count, initial hemoglobin and platelet levels, circulating polymorphonuclear and blast
percentage at diagnosis, initial blast percentage in
bone marrow, CNS involvement, cytogenetics, immunophenotype, number of induction courses to
achieve CR, and the trial in which patients where
included.
Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the
time of initial diagnosis of ALL to death of any cause
and disease-free survival (DFS) from the time of CR
to death of any cause or first event (recurrence,
death of any cause), or last follow-up. Survival after
the second neoplasm was calculated from the time
of diagnosis of the second neoplasm to death of any
cause. The risk of second neoplasm was estimated
by cumulative incidence functions for second neoplasm and death as cause of failure. The study of the
impact of secondary neoplasm on mortality was performed thanks to a regression model that split the
mortality hazard into 2 components: mortality
hazard caused by ALL or ALL with secondary neoplasm and expected mortality due to other causes.22
The concept of relative survival is based on the
formula:

Treatment Regimens
Details of the treatment regimens have been previously published.1,7 Informed consent was obtained
for every patient. Treatment schedules have been
previously reported and are summarized in Figure 1.

kObs is the raw observed mortality rate, with ke the
expected mortality rate due to other causes
(zs 5 sex), and kc the mortality caused by ALL, z a
vector of covariates. The expected mortality according to sex, age at death, and year of death was
obtained from French published vital statistics
(INSEE data). The raw mortality hazard and ALL-specific or ALL with secondary neoplasm-specific mortality hazard were plotted to show the effect of ALL
and ALL with secondary neoplasm on mortality.

Patients With Secondary Neoplasms
As of February 2005 a total of 23 secondary neoplasms (1.5%) have been observed. The clinical and
biologic characteristics of the 23 patients are summarized in Table 3. Twelve patients have been treated in the LALA-87 regimen, while 11 have entered
the LALA-94 trial. Second neoplasm developed in 22
patients during the first complete hematologic remission. In 1 case a second neoplasm occurred after the
patient had been treated for ALL recurrence. Karyotypes were available in less than two-thirds of cases
in the LALA-87 trial, in which karyotype analysis
was not systematically performed at diagnosis. All
patients developing a second neoplasm received continuation therapy after achieving CR, while 32% of all
patients included in the LALA-87 and LALA-94 trials
did not, mainly due to medical decisions, severe toxicity during induction therapy resulting in poor physical condition, early recurrence, patient refusal, or

while 10 patients received stem cell transplantation
(5 allogeneic SCT and 5 autologous SCT). The conditioning regimen for patients undergoing SCT
included total-body irradiation (TBI) plus cyclophosphamide (9 patients) or cyclophosphamide alone (1
patient). Two out of 5 allografted patients presented
severe chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and
further developed squamous cell cancer of the skin
or buccal cavity.

Risk Factors
In most cases of second neoplasm there was no family history suggesting cancer predisposition: in 10
patients the history was negative; in 9 patients no
report was received; and in 4 cases 1 first- or second-degree relative was suffering from a malignant
disease. When considering all patients from the LALA
database with a report on family history, a positive
family history of neoplasm was more frequent for
patients developing second neoplasm (29% vs 20%).
The difference was not significant. However, the
accuracy of such data was certainly limited by the
variability of obtaining information from our database. Regarding professional occupancy, there was
no specific exposure to toxics in the cohort of
23 patients who developed a second neoplasm.
The development of secondary neoplasm was
not associated with the use of any specific cytotoxic
agent. However, the risk of skin tumor increased with
radiation dose and transplantation (P 5 .01).
Outcome
The median follow-up from diagnosis of second neoplasm was 3.8 years. At the time of the analysis, 13
patients (56%) with second neoplasm were alive: 9
were still in first CR, and 4 who had recurrence of

median time from initiation of primary treatment to
diagnosis of the second neoplasm was 4.5 years
(range, 0.5–13.8 years) (Fig. 4).
Finally, the mortality rates for ALL patients without second neoplasm and ALL patients with second
neoplasm was assessed. Raw mortality rates and
ALL-specific mortality rates showed 2 identical
curves (Fig. 5A). The raw mortality rate function is
identical to the ALL-specific mortality rate because
the expected mortality is very low in comparison
with the ALL-specific mortality rate. When the mortality rate is low, that is, less than 10%, one could
consider it a conditional mortality probability per
year. In Figure 5A, conditionally for being alive at 5
years, the probability of dying between Year 5 and
Year 6 is close to 3%.
Figure 5B shows ALL-specific mortality rates and
ALL with second neoplasm-specific mortality rates.

The impact on mortality of ALL with second neoplasm is minor during the first 4 years after diagnosis
of ALL, given that patients have to live to develop a
secondary neoplasm. The impact on mortality of ALL
with second neoplasm seems negligible afterward.
Moreover, the conditional probability of dying after 4
years is identical with or without a secondary neoplasm for patients with ALL; this probability is close
to 5%.

DISCUSSION
Among the 1494 patients who were enrolled in the
LALA-87 or the LALA-94 trials between 1987 and
2002, we found an estimated cumulative risk of a
new malignancy of 2.1% at 5 years, 4.9% at 10 years,
and 9.4% at 15 years after starting chemotherapy. To
our knowledge, no studies have attempted to
describe the overall risk of second cancer among
adults treated for ALL. Previous studies have reported
an increased risk of new malignancies after treatment of childhood ALL.13–19 Hematologic malignancies develop relatively early, while solid cancers have
a longer latency period. This tends to be confirmed
in adults. In our study the median time from diagnosis of ALL to the diagnosis of second malignancy was
1.7 years for AML/MDS, while it was 6.9 years and
3.7 years for skin tumors and other solid tumors,
respectively. The risk for developing a solid tumor
increased over time and was highest among patients
who had undergone transplantation as postremission
therapy. Patients who have undergone SCT have an
increased risk for secondary cancers compared with
the general population of patients. It is speculated
that the increased risk of solid cancers after SCT is

related to pretransplantation conditioning with radiation and altered immune function. It has been
reported that immune-suppressed patients have an
increased risk of cancer at certain sites. Chronic
GVHD, with the attendant chronic inflammation, has
long been suspected as a potential risk factor for the
development of squamous cell cancers of the skin
and the buccal cavity.23,24 This was confirmed in our
study, in which the 2 patients of the cohort present-

2753

ing a severe chronic GVHD developed this type of
second malignancy. In immune-suppressed patients,
oncogenic viruses may also contribute to squamous
cell cancer of the skin and buccal mucosa after
SCT.25
The risk of secondary neoplasm in adult ALL survivors may be influenced by genetic or other predisposing factors, as well as by the treatment given for
the primary disease. Although the percentage of family cases of cancer was more important in the cohort
of 23 patients with second malignancy than in the
entire cohort of ALL patients treated in the LALA
trials, the existence of such a predisposing factor
was not conclusive. Furthermore, this was not an
epidemiologic study and the accuracy of data was
certainly limited by the variability of obtaining information. Similarly, professional occupancy did not
appear as a predisposing factor (data not shown).
However, this could be related to the small number
of patients in our series. Other predisposing risk factors comprise possible combinations. In childhood
ALL, some combinations of tumors seem to be
related to underlying genetic syndromes. It has been
suggested that genetically determined susceptibility
is involved in the association observed between brain
tumors and leukemia.26 Secondary neoplasms may
also result from a specific combination of age, genetics, first malignancy, and therapy. The biologic characteristics of the leukemic cells may also be
associated with the development of malignancy. In
childhood ALL more secondary neoplasms in T-cell
lineage leukemia has been reported, although the
cumulative risk was not significantly increased.17,27
Such combinations were not studied in our series of
adults.
Therapy-related secondary neoplasms have been
identified in patients receiving radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or combined modality therapy for a variety
of primary neoplasms. In childhood ALL studies have
documented a clear relationship between prior therapeutic irradiation and the occurrence of CNS tumors,
sarcomas of bone, and thyroid cancers.14,17,28–30 Such
occurrences did not emerge from our study.
Multiagent chemotherapy as part of multimodality therapy for malignant disease has increased the
difficulty of assessing which agents might play a
causative role in the development of secondary neoplasms. Alkylating agents and DNA-topoisomerase II
inhibitors have been linked to the development of
secondary AML and myelodysplastic syndrome.31
However, DNA-topoisomerase II inhibitors were not
part of the treatment of adult ALL. Only alkylating
agents were used. Alkylating agents and irradiation
both possess strong mutagenic activity in vitro plus

carcinogenic potency in vivo. In contrast to the
results of previous studies performed in children, our
investigation in adults could not demonstrate a clear
relationship between the dose of cyclophosphamide
or anthracyclines and the occurrence of secondary
neoplasms or special types of secondary neoplasm.
This could be related to the smaller number of
patients reported in our study, but also to the important differences in terms of doses between children’s
and adults’ therapeutic schedules.32
Considering this large unselected cohort of adult
ALL, we showed that the risk of developing a secondary neoplasm after LALA therapy is relatively low,
although higher than in childhood ALL previously
reported in the literature. However, our data must be
carefully interpreted and definitely show some limits.
Indeed, the risk of developing a second cancer has to
be viewed in the context of the survival probability
provided by a given treatment protocol, as low survival will result in fewer secondary neoplasms. However, it appears that patients undergoing SCT have
an increased risk for development of second malignancies. The contribution of treatment received
before or during transplantation remains unclear.
The question of the actual additive contribution of
the transplant procedure remains unsolved. It is
unclear whether the subsequent malignancy is
related to pretransplantation chemotherapy and
radiotherapy, whether it is the result of transplant
conditioning regimens, or whether it is a cumulative
effect of all of these exposures. The risk of second
malignancy in adult ALL remains underestimated.
Only patients aged up to 60 years were included in
our trials and thus in the analysis. A significant proportion of adults with ALL are older and would, by
virtue of age and comorbidities, intuitively be
expected to have a higher rate of secondary malignancy. However, if mortality related to ALL is high,
the proportion surviving to develop a secondary
malignancy would be lower in number, thereby reducing the incidence. Larger series with long-term followup are necessary, as well as methods of screening and
identification of patients at increased risk. Greater
insight into the molecular pathogenesis of therapyrelated leukemia would allow treatment regimens to be
changed to prevent this late complication.
