ABSTRACT
In the light of current treatment developments for non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), the idea of a plastic cellular tumorigenic network bound by
key paracrine signaling pathways mediating resistances to targeted therapies
is brought forward. Based on a review of available preclinical and clinical data
in NSCLC combinational approaches to address drivers of this network with
marketed drugs are discussed. Five criteria for selecting drug combination
regimens aiming at its disruption and thereby overcoming resistances are
postulated.

THE HOLISTIC CONCEPT OF TUMOR
BIOLOGY

histopathological analysis. Depending on the tumor
region and the level of oxygen and nutrients available in
designated areas, specific genes are expressed varying
from cell type to cell type. In turn, this leads to distinct
effects driving the rates of proliferation, vascularization,
inflammation and invasiveness. This review will focus on
evolving treatment options for non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) with respect to the intercellular interdependence
within the cellular tumorigenic network. Lung cancer is
the leading cause of cancer‑related mortality worldwide.
Histopathological grading identifies ~80-85% of lung
cancers as NSCLCs and 15‑20% as small‑cell lung cancers
(SCLCs) [3]. Most cases of NSCLC are diagnosed at
advanced metastasized stages. These tumors and some
of non-resectable stage III carcinomas are treated with
a platinum based combination chemotherapy which is
the mainstay regimen in the absence of predictive driver
mutations. First‑line chemo­therapies for NSCLC therapy
consist of platinum‑based drugs (carboplatin or cisplatin)
combined with cytotoxic drugs such as docetaxel,
paclitaxel, gemcitabine, vinorelbine or pemetrexed [4].
In addition, many different targeted therapy drugs are
under development or have already been approved for the
treatment of NSCLC patients in selected tumor conditions
as partly discussed below [5, 6]. However, the 5‑year
survival rate of NSCLC patients is still below 20% and
thus the medical need for the development of effective
treatment concepts remains one of the greatest challenges
for health care systems worldwide so far [7].

In 2011 Hanahan and Weinberg updated their
concept “Hallmarks of Cancer” by adding two further
aspects of tumor biology, (i) reprogramming of energy
metabolism and (ii) evading immune destruction. In
total they describe 10 different mechanisms of tumor
biology. The feature of this overarching and integrating
concept is its holistic view on a tumor as an organ [1].
Most importantly this concept emphasizes the tumor´s
constitution of different cell types with distinct functions
in its biology. These specialized cell types build a cellular
tumorigenic network and they serve at different steps
during the course of tumorigenesis in an integrated
inter- and intracellular signaling network. Apart from the
neoplastic founder cell which likely originated from some
critical event of genetic alteration [2], non-neoplastic cells
such as cancer associated fibroblasts, endothelial cells and
immune cells comprise the heterotypic cell biology of a
tumor. Tumor cell signaling reprograms these cell types
leading to induction of processes such as angiogenesis,
apoptosis inhibition, immune evasion and synthesis of
soluble tumor microenvironment components. During
the evolving tumor development signaling networks
within the tumor are reshaped further and expression
programs such as hypoxia lead to heterogeneity within
specific tumor areas which also can be observed by

CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE
TREATMENT OF ADVANCED NSCLC

introduced a further median PFS of 3-4 months with
median overall survival of 7 months following progress
on first-line chemotherapy [10, 11]. Since introduction of
angiogenesis inhibitors in addition to chemotherapy in the
first-line treatment of NSCLC improvements have been
made in PFS of unselected patients by approximately
2-3 months, however with conflicting results on overall
survival [12, 13]. Two trials that investigated VEGFRinhibition in addition to docetaxel in second-line treatment
of patients with NSCLC led to improvements of median
overall survival of 1-2 months versus control [14, 15].
Today it is widely accepted that cancer stem
cells (CSCs) carrying oncogenic and tumor suppressor
mutations drive the process of tumor progression and
cancer risk has been attributed to the number of stem cell

Targeted therapy
Upon diagnosis, approximately 50% of all patients
with NSCLC present with locally advanced, unresectable
or metastasized disease. NSCLC has long been considered
as comparatively chemoresistent and the median for
overall survival is 10-12 months for platinum based
combination regimens with median progression free
survival (PFS) of 5 months and remission rates of 1520% [8, 9]. The establishment of second line regimens

Figure 1: Simplified model of preventing drug resistances by simultaneous targeting of interdependent signaling in
the cellular tumorigenic network of NSCLC tumors using already marketed drugs. Signaling axes of VEGF-VEGFR,

EGF-EGFR, SDF-1-CXCR4, COX2-PGE2-EP and PD-1-PD-L1 are exemplary shown for some of the known paracrine pathways binding
the cellular tumorigenic network in NSCLC tumors. Evidence is provided that resistances to targeted therapy drugs is partly based on
substitutions of inhibited pathways in monotherapy. Therefore, combined targeted therapies against selected pathways may overcome
primary and secondary drug resistance. Examples of FDA-approved drugs are provided adjacent to the respective targeted pathways
(updated from Langhammer, 2013 [129]). PGE2, prostaglandin E2; VEGFR, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor; EGFR, epidermal

divisions [16]. Molecular diagnostics have identified so
called “driver mutations” which account in some welldefined populations, for development of lung tumors.
K-RAS and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
are the earliest identified driver oncogenes. EGFR is
overexpressed in about 50% of NSCLC tumors and
correlates with poor prognosis [17]. This observation
led to the development of small molecules targeting the
intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR in order
to block the abundant downstream signaling in these
tumors. Gefitinib and erlotinib were the first drugs with
such a mechanism of action that received FDA approval
for patients with advanced NSCLC stages IIIB/IV in
2003 and 2004 respectively. However, a response rate of
only 10% was observed in early clinical trials with these
compounds leading to further investigation of the EGFR
signaling pathway in NSCLC [18]. Specific mutations
within the EGFR coding gene were observed only in
patients responding to EGFR inhibitor therapy. These
predictive EGFR mutations occur in about 10-15% of
NSCLC adenocarcinoma patients in the Caucasian and in
about 30-40% in the East Asian population, preferably in
patients who are nonsmokers or former light smokers [19].
The identified predominant EGFR mutations are in-frame
deletions in exon 19 (45%), mutations in exon 21, mainly
L858R (40-45%) and mutations in exon 18 and 20 [20].
The availability of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors such
as gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib introduced one further
line of therapy for patients with NSCLC and activating
mutations in the EGFR gene. The expected median
survival of patients with activating mutations is now in
the range of about 28 months with median freedom from
progression of about 10-12 months [21, 22].
Similar to EGFR, today many different genetic
mutations in NSCLC and in other tumor entities
have been described and serve as starting point for
the development of new compounds targeting hyperactivated kinases. Additional genetic mutations identified
in NSCLC adenocarcinoma encompass KRAS (~30%),
EML4-ALK (~5%), MET (HGF, ~4%), BRAF/PIK3CA
(~3%), HER2/MEK (~2%), ROS1 (~2%) and others with
lower incidences. However, it is still remarkable that in
NSCLC in about 20% (squamous carcinoma) to 40%
(adenocarcinoma) no driver mutations could be identified
despite routinely used molecular diagnostics [23, 24].
One of the most frequently encountered oncogenes in
NSCLC is K-RAS which has been difficult to address
pharmacologically and which is considered one of the
cardinal routers of mitogenic signaling. To address
K-RAS mutated carcinoma downstream targets have been
exploited. For example, MEK was addressed in K-RAS
mutated NSCLC tumors by combining the MEK-inhibitor
selumetinib with docetaxel in second line therapy.
However, this study failed to reach the primary endpoint
of progression free survival [25]. In melanoma the
addition of a MEK inhibitor, trametinib, to RAF inhibitor
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

dabrafenib improves progression free survival by about 2
months [26].
All therapeutics that were developed for targeting
driver mutations in NSCLC, such as gefitinib or afatinib
for EGFRm or crizotinib and ceritinib for EML-4-ALK
translocation have in common that after a certain time
of partial or even complete responses in these patients,
resistance mutations evolve and a loss of efficacy for the
respective drug is observed. The approximate time until
a drug resistant clone is outgrown and mediates therapy
resistance in these tumors is less than a year [21, 22].
As a consequence, 2nd and 3rd generation tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are being developed targeting the
initial driver mutations but circumventing drug resistance
mutations. An example of such a drug is osimertinib.
Osimertinib is an irreversible 3rd generation TKI approved
for treatment of EGFR mutated NSCLC tumors harboring
the T790M drug resistance mutation, which evolve in
about 60% of EGFRm tumors treated with 1st or 2nd
generation TKIs [27]. From this aspect the initial treatment
of a tumor harboring a targetable driver mutation reflects
the competition against the evolution of drug resistant
clones. This results in sequential therapy regimens, trying
to stick with the next round of an evolutionary race.
However, the development of these drugs has provided
a significant step forward in the treatment of many tumor
entities. The interim analysis of a sub-cohort of a clinical
phase I trial (AURA) with osimertinib in EGFR mutated,
but not T790M positive tumors, revealed an objective
response rate (ORR) of 67-87% and a median PFS of 19.3
months with a manageable safety profile [28]. Compared
to the efficacy of 1st or 2nd generation TKIs in this patient
population this is an increase of about 9 months in PFS if
the final analysis will confirm these results. The progress
made with such drugs for late stage NSCLC therapy
becomes even clearer when TKI therapies are compared
to platinum-based chemotherapies approved for this
indication, resulting in ORRs of about 20% and PFS rates
of about 4 months. At the same time the safety profiles
of new generation TKIs is more favorable compared to
classical chemotherapeutics. For example, in second line
NSCLC patients treated with osimertinib the incidence
of any adverse event of grade 3 or higher was 32% [29]
compared to an incidence of 76% in such patients when
treated with docetaxel chemotherapy [10].

Immunotherapy
Another evolving field in targeted cancer therapy
is the therapeutic intervention in tumor biology aiming
at the detection and destruction of tumor cells by the
immune system. Vaccination with tumor-specific antigens
is one approach that is being evaluated since many years.
Currently, for NSCLC different vaccines based on tumor
antigens including MAGE-3, MUC1 or NY-ESO-1 are
in advanced clinical development phases. In addition,

cellular based therapy approaches by direct administration
of T cells or dendritic cells stimulated with such antigens
are being developed. These type of immunotherapies
have been shown to prolong PFS and OS in NSCLC
patients significantly when compared to treatment
arms heterogeneously composed of only placebo, best
supportive care or chemotherapy. The cellular approaches
were observed to be more effective than vaccination with
tumor antigens [OS: HR 0.81, 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.94, P =
0.01; PFS: HR 0.83, 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.95, P = 0.006] as
calculated by a meta-analysis [30].
In this review we will focus on the role of
intercellular interactions by immune checkpoint inhibitors
as the most impactful development in immunotherapy
within the last decades. The underlying concept of this
approach is the cancer immune-editing process. Three
distinct phases of this process of intercellular signaling
lead to the evasion from immune detection and the
final outgrowth of the tumor [31]. In the first phase, the
elimination phase, transformed cells are still well detected
by the collaboration of the adaptive and the innate
immune system resulting in their elimination. This phase
is driven by immune stimulatory signals of innate danger
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

signals, tumor antigens and NKG2D ligands. Possibly
this phase may be survived by transformed cells that
are less immunogenic and cells that have the ability to
modulate their cellular microenvironment by intercellular
signaling impairing the adaptive immune system. T-cells,
INF-γ and IL-12 have been implicated to influence the
functional dormancy of transformed cells in this phase
[32]. Continuous evolutionary pressure on transformed
and genetically instable cells in the equilibrium phase
is likely to result into the escape phase. Therein specific
clones of transformed cells which failed to be recognized
by the adaptive and innate immune system dominate the
cellular network. Signals from this network maintain
an immunosuppressive cellular tumorigenic network
and enable the outgrowth of this cellular complex as a
clinical significant tumor [33]. During the last decade
some of the main drivers of this immune escape process
have been identified and became well known as so called
immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Among them cytotoxic
T‑lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) was the
first molecule found to be expressed on T-cell subsets as
a downmodulator of their activation. This intercellular
signaling firstly requires T-cell receptor (TCR) activation

on a T-cell by antigen uptake and interaction of the TCR
with a MHC-I molecule on an antigen presenting cell
(APC) bringing both cells into spatial proximity. At the
same time a CD28 molecule on the T-cell engages with
a CD80 (B7.1) and a CD86 (B7.2) molecule further
increasing the activation of the T-cell by the initial TCRMHC-I interaction. Subsequently CTLA-4 is becoming
expressed on the surface of the T-cell and competes for
binding to CD80 and CD86 with CD28 resulting in a
counter signal that prevents an over activation of the
immune cell. CTLA-4 has been clinically demonstrated
to be involved in the process of the immune-editing
escape phase by mediating immune suppression on
T-cell activity and thus preventing an effective adaptive
immune response against tumor cells in different tumor
entities [34]. In line with these results a recombinant
therapeutic protein encompassing the extracellular
domain of CTLA-4, abatacept, has been FDA-approved
for the immunosuppressive treatment of rheumatoid
arthritis [35]. Ipilimumab was the first therapeutic
antibody against CTLA-4 approved for treatment of
malignant melanoma. In a clinical study ipilimumab
showed a long-term survival for more than two years in
18% of patients in a study population without any further
treatment options except experimental therapy. This result
showed for the first time an exceptional long duration of
response after short treatment periods when compared to
non-immune based therapies in oncology. This finding
underscores an induced and direct effect of the adaptive
immune system as a mechanism of this therapy concept.
However, immune-related toxicities frequently occurred
in ipilimumab treated patients and required an exceptional
level of attention [36].
A second and more recently discovered mechanism
of immune-checkpoint inhibition is the interaction of the
molecules PD-1 on T-cells (predominantly CD8+) and PDL1 on APCs such as tumor cells, dendritic cells, cancer
associated fibroblasts and immune cells expressed in 20%50% of human tumors [37]. The PD-1/PD-L1 interaction
prerequisites the same process of TCR-MHC-I interaction
as described above for CTLA-4 and also functions as an
inhibitory signaling for T-cell activity when established.
In contrast to the predominant localization of CTLA-4 in
lymphatic tissue, the immunosuppressive role of PD-1/
PD-L1 engagement seems to be critical directly within
or in close proximity to the cellular tumorigenic network
forming the tumor [38].
So far, encouraging clinical activity of anti-PD-1
antibodies was observed in many different tumor entities
including lung, colon, head and neck, gastric, melanoma
and renal cell carcinoma [39,40]. The first indication a
PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor received FDA approval was
metastatic melanoma where nivolumab showed superiority
versus chemotherapy with an ORR of 40% versus 13.9%
and an overall survival rate (OS) of 72.9% versus 42.1%
[41]. For the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab an ORR
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of up to 38% was found in metastatic melanoma patients
[42]. In the second line treatment for advanced NSCLC of
squamous histology (Checkmate 017 trial, Phase III) or
of non-squamous histology (Checkmate 057 trial, Phase
III) ORRs of 20% versus 9% (squamous) and 19% versus
12% (non-squamous) were observed for nivolumab when
compared to docetaxel. When comparing nivolumab with
docetaxel median overall survival times were significantly
improved from 9.2 versus 6.0 months [squamous
histology; HR 0.59; 95% CI, 0.44-0.79; P < 0.001] and
12.2 versus 9.4 month [non-squamous histology; HR
0.73; 95% CI, 0.59-0.89; P = 0.002]. Remarkably the
median duration of response in the non-squamous study
population was 17.2 months compared to 5.6 months
for nivolumab and docetaxel respectively. In general, in
both studies fewer side effects were observed for patients
treated with nivolumab [43,44]. Patients in these trials
were not stratified for PD-L1 expression. These results
led to recent FDA approval of nivolumab as second line
therapy for the treatment of non-squamous and squamous
advanced NSCLC without mandatory PD-L1 expression
analysis.
Another phase II/III randomized trial assessed
second line treatment with pembrolizumab versus
docetaxel in a population with advanced squamous or nonsquamous NSCLC stratified for PD-L1 expression ≥1%.
Median OS was significantly longer in the pembrolizumab
study population with 10.4 months [HR 0.71; 95%
CI, 0.58-0.88; P = 0.0008] and 12.7 months [HR 0.61;
CI, 0.49-0.75; P < 0.0001] for 2 mg/kg and at 10 mg/
kg pembrolizumab, respectively with 8.5 months for
docetaxel. Tumors with PD-L1 expression ≥50% showed
a significantly increased overall survival in the populations
treated with pembrolizumab compared to docetaxel [2 mg/
kg: 14.9 vs 8.2 months; HR 0.54; 95% CI, 0.38-0.77; P =
0.0002 and 10 mg/kg: 17.3 vs 8.2] [45].
The most impactful development in the field
of immune checkpoint inhibitors is the approval
of pembrolizumab for first line therapy in PD-L1
positive NSCLC patients based on results from the
keynote 024 study. This study found a significantly
prolonged progression free survival of 10.3 months
in pembrolizumab treated patients versus 6 months in
patients treated with a platinum-based chemotherapy
[HR for disease progression or death, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.370.68; P < 0.001]. Also in terms of response to treatment
pembrolizumab showed superiority versus chemotherapy
with an ORR of 44.8% versus 27.8%. OS was significantly
longer in pembrolizumab than in chemotherapy treated
patients [HR for death 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41-0.89; P =
0.005]. Due to these impressive results the study was
stopped preliminary and patients in the chemotherapy arm
were offered treatment with pembrolizumab [46].
The first FDA approval of a PD-L1 inhibitor for
NSCLC patients who progressed on a platinum-based
chemotherapy was granted for atezolizumab recently
43559

Oncotarget

[47]. This approval is based on results from the POPLAR
phase II and the OAK phase III studies. The median
OS in POPLAR was 12.6 months in the atezolizumab
arm compared to 9.7 months in the docetaxel arm [HR
0.73; 95% CI, 0.53-0.99; P = 0.04] [48]. The OAK study
showed a median OS of 13.8 months in the atezolizumab
arm versus to 9.6 months in the docetaxel arm [HR 0.74;
95% CI, 0.63-0.87; P = 0.0004] [49].
Taken together, to date both anti-PD-1 antibodies,
pembrolizumab and nivolumab and the PD-L1 antibody
atezolizumab are FDA-approved for the treatment of
advanced squamous and non-squamous NSCLC for
second line therapy. Currently pembrolizumab is the only
checkpoint inhibitor approved for first line treatment of
NSCLC patients. For treatment with pembrolizumab the
assessment of PD-L1 expression in ≥50% of tumor tissue
by a companion diagnostic biomarker test (PD-L1 IHC
22C3 pharmDx kit) is mandatory.
An ongoing effort in the field of immune-checkpoint
inhibition is the evaluation of combination therapies of
anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies with anti-CTLA-4
antibodies or chemotherapies [50]. The CTLA-4 antigen
becomes recruited to the surface of T-cells upon CD28
activation and limits CD80/86 induced T-cell activation
by scavenging CD80/86 from binding to CD28. The
rationale for the combination of CTLA-4 and PD-1/PDL1 inhibition is based on the observation, that CTLA4 inhibition might be a prerequisite for the release of
activated, tumor-antigen specific T-cells from lymphatic
tissues capable for the subsequent infiltration of tumor
tissue. When these activated T-cells become localized
to the tumor, the inhibition of the PD-1-PD-L1 axis
upon activated TCR-MHC-I interaction between T-cell
and tumor cells enables an efficient, localized immune
response against tumor cells [38]. Ipilimumab is currently
being trialled in combination with anti-PD-1 antibodies in
first line treatment of lung cancer and preliminary phase I
data suggest a clinical efficacy no less than a PD-1 single
agent or chemotherapy combination approach in this
setting with unprecedented survival rates [51-55]. The
potential synergies of immune checkpoint inhibition and
activation of T-cell responses by vaccination or by cellular
therapies presenting tumor specific antigens at the same
time are currently under investigation in clinical trials
[56].

that this interdependence could be the initial cause of de
novo or adaptive drug resistances in many cases [1, 57,58].
Cell types unaffected by drug treatment may substitute for
impaired signal transduction by targeted therapy drugs
(see Table 1 for overview).

Tumor endothelial cells (TECs)
The process of angiogenesis is one of the key
characteristics of neoplastic growth. The angiogenic switch
driven by the onset of hypoxia in newly forming cellular
tumorigenic networks locally reinstates the embryogenetic
growth program for blood vessels and leads to tumor
neovascularization originating from preexisting blood
vessels [59]. The initial concept of targeting angiogenic
factors for tumor therapy, such as VEGFR2 or its ligand(s)
VEGF-(A) was based on the presumption of their almost
exclusive expression in tumor tissue. Today several drugs
are approved and target VEGFRs (e.g. sunitinib, sorafenib,
ramucirumab) or VEGF (bevacizumab). Noteworthy, antiangiogenic therapy is directed towards endothelial cells
but not to tumor cells directly. The drug targets VEGFR-2
and VEGFR-3 are localized primarily to the vasculature
in human primary solid cancers but not to the tumor
cells [60]. Thus the therapeutic effect of these drugs is
anticipated to be based on the interruption of angiogenic
signaling in treated tumors, which in turn firstly leads to
the destruction of tumor vasculature [61,62]. The effect
on tumor cells seems to be a secondary event based on an
increase of hypoxia and nutrient deficiency. It was shown
that it is countered by upregulation of growth factors
which have the capacity to replace VEGF and stimulate
new blood vessel growth such as EGF and SDF1α as well
as their receptors [63]. At the same time the destruction
of tumor vasculature leads to increased hypoxia in
affected areas of the tumorigenic cellular network [64]. In
consequence HIF-1α driven survival factors are expressed
in hypoxic areas from tumor cells, cancer associated
fibroblasts and immune cells and thereby may protect
certain subpopulations of tumor cells from apoptosis or
necrosis [58, 65,66].
Mathematical modelling suggests that hypoxia may
induce a glycolytic phenotype which is more prone to
invasiveness [67]. Taken together the use of angiogenesis
inhibitors, based on their primary targeting of tumor
endothelial cells but not tumor cells, CAFs or immune
cells may initiate a pattern of therapy resistance that
either develops after a certain time of therapy (adaptive
resistance) or is immediately effective based on the
specific tumor type (de novo resistance).

INTERDEPENDENT CROSSTALK OF THE
CELLULAR TUMORIGENIC NETWORK
As described by Hanahan and Weinberg in 2011 and
discussed above, a cellular tumorigenic network consists
of different classes of cells [1]. Tumor endothelial cells
(TECs), tumor cells (TCs) and immune cells (ICs) interact
with the stromal compartment during the evolution of the
tumor in an integrated inter- and intracellular signaling
network [57]. An increasing body of evidence is provided
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Tumor cells (TCs)
Analysis of tumor cells as the classical target of
drug treatment in oncology have revealed a surprising
43560

Oncotarget

complexity of cancer genomes. These cells harbor
driver mutations representing underlying events for
tumor initiation and progression. Such as EGFR KRAS,
PTEN mutations, PIK3CA amplifications and EML4ALK translocations in NSCLC [23]. Analysis of both
squamous and nonsquamous carcinoma genomes in
the TCGA project revealed mutations or amplifications
in oxidative stress response pathway NFE/KEAP1, in
squamous differentiation related pathway SOX2/TP63,
alterations in HLA-A, the multitude of cell-cycle control
and p53 pathways as well as nucleosome modelling and
RNA processing pathways [68,69]. Of note, it was stated
that genome data did not explain all pathway activation
patterns, and many tumors lack genomic alterations to
explain phosphoprotein activation [69], a fact that may
reflect epigenetic alterations [70]. Accordingly, in 20%
of squamous carcinoma and 40% of adenocarcinoma no
accountable mutations have been identified so far [24].
Research on signal transduction network dynamics
showed that addressing oncogenic targets may result in
paradoxical effects and that oncogenicity may be contextdependent [71]. The MAPK/ERK pathway displays a
feedback inhibitory loop to upstream located targets
such as EGF. Inhibition of MEK relieves this feedback
inhibition and renders AKT signaling more active which
could explain why simple MEK inhibition did not achieve
pronounce changes in progression free survival [71,72].
The multitude of observed alterations raises the
question as to whether such tumor populations could more
effectively be addressed by exploiting combinations of
agents directed against established pathways attempting
to evoke what has been called synthetic lethality and
well worked out in the context of ovarian cancer [73].
In NSCLC, the EGF receptor is probably the best
investigated and evaluated druggable molecular target
and scrutinizing EGFR signaling could help to uncover
possible combination regimens. EGFR overexpression is
observed in the majority of NSCLC tumors [17]. NSCLC
tumor cells interact with their surrounding cellular
tumorigenic network via EGFR signaling and other cell
surface receptors that contribute to survival, proliferation,
induction of tumor promoting factors and immune evasion
[74]. The anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab, approved
for treatment of EGFR expressing colorectal cancers,
competitively blocks the binding of EGF to its receptor.
As a consequence, paracrine signaling within the cellular
tumorigenic network by EGF originating from CAFs and
immune cells for example, is blocked by EGFR signaling
interruption. In addition, cetuximab is capable of depleting
tumor cells by antibody depending cytotoxicity [75].
In NSCLC adenocarcinoma with activating EGFR
mutations, such as L858R and Del19 the receptor seems
to be constitutively active and independent from ligand
binding [76] resulting in what has been termed oncogeneaddiction [77]. Signal withdrawal evokes large shifts in
the apoptotic balance resulting in the rapid and extensive
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

remissions typically observed following EGFR-TKIs in
these cancers. In squamous lung cancer, however, almost
no such activating mutations have been observed albeit a
rate of 7% overexpression of EGFR [68]. A recent phase
III trial in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the
lung and selected for EGFR overexpression but not for
EGFR mutation revealed a significantly improved overall
survival of 11.8 months in patients receiving the EGFRmAb necitumumab plus gemcitabine-cisplatin versus 10
months in the gemcitabine-cisplatin control group [HR
0.79; 95% CI, 0.69- 0.92] [78]. This observation provides
evidence, that also in non-EGFR mutated tumors targeting
of EGFR signaling has an impact on the clinical outcome.
Activating EGFR mutations display a shift towards
stronger STAT3 and STAT5 signaling [79,80]. This
suggests that STAT3 induced genes that shift the immune
balance towards a suppressive, tolerogenic environment
could be addressed to revert this effect. The precise timing
of STAT3 modulation or inhibiton has not been worked out
and it is known that persistent STAT3 ablation may cause
autoimmunity in mice [81]. This points to the possibility
of intermittent or chronometric dosing of agents that
interfere with STAT3 signaling. For activation of STAT3
both EGFR mediated signaling as well as IL-6 signaling
has been shown to be relevant and in NSCLC tumor cells
JAK1 and not JAK2 was determined as the signal relaying
kinase [82]. Ruxolitinib and Tofacitinib, JAK-inhibitors
that can cover all three JAK-kinases, are possibly suited
to suppress STAT3 mediated effects in a two pronged way
that includes EGFR blockade. Still, it is unclear whether
JAK-inhibition will result in a clear improvement of the
immunosuppressive environment. IL-6 is one of the major
effectors of immunosuppression and a target of STAT3
[81]. Therefore, IL-6 inhibitors, either chronometrically or
continuously dosed could be an option to further improve
freedom from progression in these patients. Currently
approved antibodies against the IL-6 receptor or IL-6
itself are tocilizumab and siltuximab, respectively. Both
are being trialled in solid tumor indications and a role of
siltuximab in suppressing IL-6 mediated STAT3 activation
has been described [82].
Receptor tyrosine kinase signaling including
EGFR is associated with the emergence of epidermalmesenchymal transition (EMT) which is considered a
central switch to invasion and metastasis [71]. EMT is a
complex process the current understanding of which does
not yet allow a meaningful approach and its dynamics
suggests a gradual shift with some tumor cells still with
epithelial characteristics and some with transitional or
mesenchymal phenotype which may imply an altered
driver kinase dependency in the context of the cellular
tumorigenic network.
The main cause of treatment resistance is the
emergence of resistant tumor cells after therapy, described
in many different tumor entities [83]. Cancer stem cells
(CSCs) are suspected being the origin of outgrowing
43561

Oncotarget

therapy resistant tumor cells. CSC have a high capacity
for self-renewal and multilineage differentiation and are
believed to be responsible for tumorigenesis, therapeutic
resistance, metastasis and recurrence of cancer [84]. In
NSCLC tumor cells resistant to the EGFR TKI gefitinib
the expression of CXCR4 maintains stemness through
JAK/STAT3 downstream signaling. In these drug resistant
tumor cells the CXCR4 inhibitor plerixafor (AMD3100)
exhibits significant anti-tumorigenic effects [85]. Most
interestingly Phillip et al., showed that activation of
EGFR by its ligand under hypoxic conditions enhances
CXCR4 expression leading to malignant transformation
through increased proliferation, survival and motility
[86]. Treatment with plerixafor is also capable to sensitize
prostate cancer cells and pancreatic cancer cells to
chemotherapy [87,88] and it is believed that attachment
of CXCR4 expressing cells to the ECM protects cancer
cells from chemotherapy. In line with these results antitumor activity also was observed for the SDF-1 peptide
analogue CTCE-9908 in different tumor entities including
breast and prostate cancer [89-91]. CTCE-9908 was
shown to enhance the efficacy of anti-VEGF treatment
in an experimental mouse model [90] consisting with the
observation that a high expression of CXCR4 was found
to correlate with insensitivity against treatment with
the VEGR inhibitor sunitinib [92]. Tumor cells are also
tightly linked to tumor endothelial cells since they are the
main source of VEGF secretion inducing and maintaining
angiogenesis by paracrine signaling [64]. Antiangiogenesis therapy, such as bevacizumab treatment,
has an indirect effect on tumor cells as described above
but leads to the activation of the hypoxia HIF-1α program
resulting in the upregulation of drug resistance pathways
[62,63,93].

and survival factors such as SDF-1, bFGF, IGF-II and
HGF and by inducing the expression of their respective
receptors CXCR4, IGF-1R, HGFR [85,97,98]. Evidence
is provided that CAF secreted HGF provides resistance
to EGFR TKI therapy in NSCLC patients by cytokine
crosstalk [99] and CAF subsets mediate de novo resistance
to EGFR TKI therapy in EGFRm NSCLC [100]. Several
of these factors are also known to be HIF-1 regulated and
become increasingly expressed in different cell types in
hypoxia. CAFs were also shown to modulate the tumor
microenvironment by the expression of VEGF-A [101]
and EGF [58] and thus contribute to angiogenesis. Among
the CAF secreted cytokines the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis is
best investigated. SDF-1 of fibroblast origin can promote
tumor growth and angiogenesis [102]. CXCR4 expression
on tumor cells has been associated with a negative
prognostic value for survival, homing to tissues with
SDF-1 expression, resistance to angiogenesis inhibition
and resistance to chemotherapy [91,103].
High expression of CXCR4 also correlates with
insensitivity against treatment with the VEGR inhibitor
sunitinib in renal cancer [92]. In addition, CAFs also
display a proinflammatory gene signature mediated by
NF-kB signaling [104]. Together with the cancer cell they
are a source for immunosuppressive factors like IL-6, IL11, COX2 and also for VEGF, all of which are STAT3
induced as well as being inducers of immunosuppressive
STAT3 signaling [81]. Expression of COX2 and PGE2
within the cellular tumorigenic network has been shown
to increase tumor invasiveness and function as mediators
of tumor progression [105]. COX2 produced PGE2 was
recently shown to be a mediator of resistance to the
VEGFR-inhibitor axitinib and the combination of axitinib
and COX2 inhibition was suggested to be a potential
target to suppress metastasizing potential [106,107].
IL-6 secreted by CAFs mediates EMT and contributes
to platinum resistance in NSCLC cell lines and isolated
cancer cells of NSCLC patients [108].

Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs)
The
connective
tissue
of
the
tumor
microenvironement consists of the extracellular matrix
(ECM), and fibroblasts of which cancer-associated
fibroblasts (CAFs) as a distinct class are being discerned
from tissue-associated native fibroblasts [57]. CAFs
are thought to derive from epithelial and endothelial
mesenchymal transitions, from myeloid precursors
and from host fibroblasts [57,94]. They are thought to
coevolve with the tumor and migrate, differentiate and
secrete factors which may influence both tumor cells as
well as the surrounding immune cells [94]. Their role
and their contribution to tumorigenesis, angiogenesis
and invasiveness within the cellular tumorigenic network
became increasingly recognized during the last years
[58]. Increasing evidence is provided that CAFs provide a
target for chemoprevention in lung cancer and other tumor
entities [95,96].
CAFs orchestrate the cellular tumorigenic network
and contribute to cancer stemness by secreting growth
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Immune cells (ICs)
Immune cells have long been known to play an
important role in tumorigenic processes. Inflammatory
cells infiltrating the tumor contribute to angiogenesis,
tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. These effects
are based on signaling within the cellular tumorigenic
network by the release of factors such as VEGF, EGF,
cytokines and chemokines [57,100,110]. Despite the
potential localization of inflammatory cells and their proinflammatory effects within this network, such as NK
cells and CD8+ CTLs, neo-antigens from tumor cells
are rarely recognized due a state of immunosuppression.
Tumor cells express factors that inhibit an anti-tumor
immune response, such as programmed cell death 1
ligand 1 (PD-L1), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO),
IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). The
43562

Oncotarget

immunomodulatory effects of these factors prevent
the process of antigen recognition, CTL activation
and immune response towards antigen-expressing
cells [111]. Tumor-specific antigens may originate
from oncogenic viruses, differentiation antigens and
epigenetically modified molecules or from mutationinduced neo-antigens [112]. As described above the
underlying mechanism of the suppression of T-cell
effector functions is based on constitutively overexpressed
immunosuppressive cell surface molecules on tumor cells,
such as PD-L1 [38]. Breaking the immune-checkpoint
inhibition within the cellular tumorigenic network is
currently one of the most promising therapy concepts in
oncology. However, patient populations with NSCLC
tumors driven by EGFR mutations or EML4-ALK
translocations treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors showed
reduced ORRs compared to patient populations harboring
EGFR and ALK wild-type tumors. This observation is in
line with low rates of PD-L1 expression and CD8+ tumorinfiltrating cells (TILs) in corresponding tumors [113].
In T-cell infiltrated tumors with a signature indicative of
active Th1-type response tumor escape is characterized by
PD-L1 upregulation, by induction of and infiltration with
CD25+FOXP3+Tregs and by T-cell anergy characterized
by defective IL-2 secretion upon antigen stimulation
[114]. An antibody against CTLA-4 in combination with
anti PD-L1 was shown to revert T-cell anergy in this
setting as shown by increased proliferation and increased
production of IL-2 and TNF-α indicative of functional
T cells [114]. Most interestingly PD-L1 has recently
been described as a direct target of HIF-1α consisting of
an active HIF response element (HRE) in its promotor
region. Experiments in tumor-bearing mice under hypoxic
conditions resulted in a significant up-regulation of PDL1 on macrophages, dendritic cells, and tumor cells
[115]. This observation underscores the multiplicity of
pathway interactions and their interdependencies between
the components of the cellular tumorigenic network once
again. Still, remission rates induced by PD-1 antibody
nivolumab second line after platinum based chemotherapy
in both squamous and non-squamous carcinoma of the
lung are in the range of 20% with a median PFS in the
range of 2.2-3.5 months [43,44].
In the cellular tumorigenic network, the balance
between tumor cells and the cells of the surrounding
innate and adaptive immune system is determined by
elements with both tumor repressive and tumor supportive
features. The cell types that act in a tumor-repressive
immunogenic way are governed by NK/NKT-cells and
Th1-cells. Macrophages and Neutrophils display type 1
characteristics and IFNγ, IL-2 and IL-12 are important
cytokines [116]. The tumor promoting arm of that balance
is determined by the presence of cells of myeloid origin,
Type 2 suppressive T-cells (Tregs) and Th2-cells and IL4, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-13 are relevant cytokines. The ratio
of Th2/Th1 cells correlates with parameters of clinical
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

progression in breast cancers [116]. The role of Th17cells is considered to be context dependent and can be
both repressive and supportive [57, 109, 110, 116]. STAT
signaling plays a major role in the crosstalk between
somatic and immune cells and STATS 1, 2 and 4 contribute
to a tumor suppressive response whereas STATs 3, 5 and 6
act more immunosuppressive [81]. Tumor cells are able to
induce a suppressive phenotype by STAT3-signaling which
leads to secretion of IL-6 and may suppress the activity
of several cell types relevant to antigen presentation and
cytotoxic T-cell responses. Numerous genes are being
influenced by STAT3. They include proliferation and
survival related genes and angiogenesis genes like VEGF,
HIF1α, bFGF and HGF as well as immunosuppressive
factors like IL-6 and IL-10 [117]. STAT3 also suppresses
the expression of Th1-associated gene products like IFNb,
IFNγ and IL-12 and induces genes like COX2 and NOS
that are associated with an inflammatory phenotype. IL-6
induced genes may themselves induce STAT3 and thus
contribute to maintenance via a feedforward loop [118].
COX2 as a STAT3 induced gene is by itself a suppressor of
antigen-specific immunity. Local overexpression of COX2
generates an immunosuppressive milieu by mechanisms
that involve IL-4, IDO and IFNγ [119]. PGE2 as a product
of COX2 amplifies the suppressive activity of CD25+
Tregs and induces FOXP3+ in both CD25- and CD25+cells thus contributing to immunosuppression [120]. In
NSCLC a large share of tumor infiltrating leukocytes are
CD25+ Tregs that may suppress T-cell proliferation. An
increased number of CD4+FOXP3+ Tregs correlates with
poor prognosis in NSCLC suggesting that differentiation
of CD4+ to CD4+FOXP3+ cells may contribute to tumor
escape. Thus, influencing factors such as COX2 and IL-6
display effects on tumor progression.

THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES FOR
DISRUPTING
KEY
SIGNALING
CROSSTALK IN THE CELLULAR
TUMORIGENIC NETWORK OF NSCLC
As described above the cellular tumorigenic
network can be described as an interdependent network
of intercellular signaling via cell surface receptors of its
different cell types. As an example in case of EGFRm
NSCLC these dependencies are profoundly skewed in
favor of the EGFR as a driver stimulus. Recently the
combination therapy of bevacizumab plus erlotinib
was approved for first line therapy of patients with
EGFR mutated advanced NSCLC based on a Japanese
clinical phase 2 study. In this trial, median progression
free survival in the combination arm was 16.0 months
(95%CI 13·9-18·1) versus 9.7 months with erlotinib
alone [HR 0.54; 95%CI, 0·36- 0·79]; log-rank P =
0·0015). Three complete responses (CRs) were observed
in the combination arm versus one CR in the erlotinib
43563

Oncotarget

monotherapy arm. Interestingly, overall response rates
of 69% in the combination arm compared to 64% in the
monotherapy arm were not significantly different. The
incidence of grade 3-4 adverse events was elevated in
the combination arm. However, no new AE categories
were identified and the safety profile was manageable in
both groups [121]. For the first time these results show
a significant additive effect in the treatment of advanced
NSCLC patients by combining the two different treatment
concepts of anti-angiogenesis and inhibition of tumor cell
proliferation based on EGFR driver mutations. Because
the combination therapy only had a minimal effect on the
initial response rates (ORRs 69% versus 64%), blocking
of both mechanisms must have had at least an effect on
the adaptive cellular resistance preventing the outgrowth
of erlotinib drug resistant tumor cell subclones for a
longer time in the combination arm than under erlotinib
monotherapy. Obviously, in this setting of a kinaseaddicted tumor the addition of bevacizumab to erlotinib
potentiated the effect of erlotinib, resulting in what can
be called an evolutionary bottleneck to the tumor in its
cellular tumorigenic network. For this combination, one
may speculate that after an initial depletion of tumor
cells by erlotinib outgrowth of drug resistant tumor cell
clones, harboring resistance mutations such as T790M was
prevented by simultaneous inhibition of tumor endothelial
cell growth and their secretion of pro-tumorigenic factors,
such as SDF-1, by bevacizumab [65,122]. This effect may
have prolonged time to an adaptive cellular resistance. A
later occurring loss of efficacy in the combination arm
may have been based on a slowly evolving substitution
of tumor endothelial cell signaling by CAFs or immune
cells within the cellular network. Evidence for a similar
mechanism has recently been provided showing that
a combined suppression of endothelial cells and CAF
growth resulted in synergistic effects when using
bevacizumab in bevacizumab-resistant cancer cells (Table
1) [123].
Taken together the study published by Seto et al.,
confirmed the pronounced efficacy of EGFR TKIs in
NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations and for the
first time showed that a meaningful improvement of this
therapy concept is possible by combining drugs with
different mechanisms of action. This effect might be
expected of similarly kinase-addicted types of tumors
such as those with activating translocations of ALK and
ROS. This observation provides the rationale for further
combinations of targeted therapies addressing the factors
of interdependency in the cellular tumorigenic network as
discussed in this review and which may lead to improved
therapeutic efficacies. Therefore, a combination therapy
should address each cell type involved in linking the
cellular tumorigenic network: The proliferation of
malignant tumor cells can be effectively targeted at their
driver mutations if present, such as for EGFR mutated
tumors by EGFR TKIs. The tumor promoting effects
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of tumor endothelial cells (angiogenesis, tumor cell
survival and metastasis) can be targeted by inhibition of
VEGFRs or VEGFs. Mediated survival signals to tumor
cells originating from cancer associated fibroblasts
can be targeted by blocking the SDF-1-CXCR4 axis
and COX2 for example. At the same time immune cell
activation could further elevate the pressure on the
cellular tumorigenic network integrity by PD-1 or PDL1 inhibition. Against all of these different tumor targets
approved drugs are available (Table 1; Figure 1). Concerns
regarding the potential toxicity of combination therapies
should be taken into account. Start dosages of selected
combined drug regimens may be chosen in dose escalation
steps starting significantly below monotherapy dosages,
anticipating additive or synergistic effects and thus
lowering toxicity at the same time. Patient stratification
should be mandatory by expression (e.g. PD-L1, CXCR4,
COX2) or mutational (EGFRm) analysis in tumor biopsies.
In the interest of a valid clinical research rationale, it
would be most desirable that selected targets for the design
of novel therapeutic approaches possess predictive values.
In this approach it holds true for PD-L1 expression and
for EGFR mutations as described above, but it remains
less clear for CXCR4 and COX2. However, in line with
the presented data-based hypothesis the predictivity of
some targets may only be observable in combinational
therapeutic approaches.
In summary, the results reviewed in this article
provide evidence that simultaneous and distinct targeting
of signaling from different cell types forming the cellular
tumorigenic network may break the intercellular crosstalk
and thus may overcome de novo and may delay adaptive
drug resistances. Noteworthy, the direct suppression of
cellular interdependency may most likely be achieved
when targeting paracrine signaling axes of cell surface
receptors and their respective ligands critical for the
respective tumor biology. Based on the findings discussed
in this review we suggest the following five criteria for
selecting a combinational targeted therapy approach in late
stage NSCLC patients:
(i)	Target expression or activating mutation proven
by expression and/or mutational analysis
(ii)	
Target should be part of a paracrine
signaling pathway mediating intercellular interdependency
within the cellular tumorigenic network (see Table 1)
(iii)	
Drug combination should be selected
from non-overlapping intercellular signaling axes targeting
each cell type of the cellular tumorigenic network
(iv)	
Selected drugs should have proven antitumor activity in clinical or preclinical studies
(v)		
Manageable safety profile of drug
combinations.
