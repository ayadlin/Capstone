BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to investigate the dependence between progression-free survival (PFS) and overall
survival (OS) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) and to explore whether PFS can be used as an intermediate
endpoint of OS in this patient population. METHODS: A total of 1381 patients from 2 prospective phase 3 trials (Cancer and Leukemia
Group B [CALGB] 90206 and AVOREN) of interferon-alpha with or without bevacizumab were analyzed. Both trials recruited previously untreated patients with clear cell mRCC with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2; adequate
bone marrow, hepatic, cardiac, and renal function; and controlled blood pressure. The CALGB study served as the training data set,
and the AVOREN study served as the testing data set. The dependence between PFS and OS was investigated using the Kendall tau
for bivariate time-to-event endpoints. RESULTS: In the training data set, the median OS times among patients who experienced progressive disease at 3 months or 6 months were 6 months and 8 months, respectively, compared with 25 months and 30 months,
respectively, (P <.001) in patients who did not develop disease progress. The adjusted hazard ratios (HR) were 2.6 (P <.0001) and 2.8
(P <.0001), respectively, for patients who did and did not progress at 3 months or 6 months. The dependence between PFS and OS
was 0.53. These associations were confirmed in the testing data set. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mRCC who were treated with
interferon-alpha with or without bevacizumab, the PFS at 3 months and 6 months was found to be predictive of OS. A high dependence between PFS and OS was observed, suggesting that PFS may be used as a surrogate endpoint for OS. Although this is a novel
observation for RCC, these findings require validation in patients with mRCC who are treated with other targeted agents. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Advances in understanding the genetics and biology of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have led to the successful development
of novel therapies that target the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and mammalian target of rapamycin pathways.1-7 Regulatory approval for nearly all of the available agents were based on the rather large improvements in
progression-free survival (PFS) over a standard control arm. It is important to note that in these trials, the hazard ratios
(HRs) for PFS for these agents were large, the available standard therapies were sufficiently limited, the toxicity profiles
were acceptable within the context of available therapies, and the overall survival (OS) trends mirrored the PFS results in
direction even though the magnitude of survival benefit was limited and often not statistically significant. It was thus relatively straightforward for regulatory authorities to determine that improvements in PFS were reasonably likely to provide
a clinically relevant benefit within the context of known risk and known available therapies.
It is critical to note that PFS, although a convenient and objective intermediate endpoint, has not been established as
a reliable surrogate endpoint in metastatic RCC (mRCC), even within the context of VEGF pathway-directed therapy.
This is best illustrated by the recent lack of support for the regulatory approval of the alternative VEGF receptor tyrosine

kinase inhibitor tivozanib after a phase 3 trial in which a
statistically significant but clinically modest improvement
in PFS was demonstrated, but OS favored the control
therapy.
These results have reignited the debate as to the true
relationship between PFS and OS in RCC, and whether
the observed lack of a tight relationship in phase 3 trials is
due to the inadequacy of this intermediate endpoint or
the effects of posttrial therapy. The latter is especially important in patients with RCC given that several agents
were developed and marketed simultaneously.1-7
Although the relationship between PFS and OS has
been evaluated in other tumor types, most notably in
colorectal and breast cancer, to the best of our knowledge
it has been examined in only 1 analysis of patients with
mRCC.8-11 Heng et al evaluated the relationship between
PFS and OS among 1158 patients treated from 2005
through 2009. However, the data were based on retrospective and nonrandomized patients and the authors did
not externally validate their findings.11
The association between PFS and OS is not a foregone conclusion in patients with mRCC because the development and approval of a large number of agents
targeting similar pathways have created the potential for a
significant number of postprogression therapies that may
confound and attenuate treatment effects on OS in phase
3 trials. Furthermore, the relatively long survival of
patients with mRCC, and the significant heterogeneity in
outcomes (with survival reported to exceed 10 years in
20% of patients with a good prognosis), have resulted in
the requirement for large trial sizes, long follow-up times,
and large effect sizes if OS is used as the study endpoint.
It was with these concerns in mind that an evaluation was undertaken of the usefulness of PFS as an intermediate endpoint for OS in patients with mRCC who
were treated on 2 large phase 3 trials.
The main objective of the current study was to
examine whether PFS is a valid intermediate endpoint of
OS in patients with mRCC, using data from 2 large, prospective, phase 3 trials (Cancer and Leukemia Group B
[CALGB] 90206 and AVOREN) that tested the VEGF
targeted agent, bevacizumab, in similar patient populations.4,5 This allowed for the use of one of these studies as
a training data set and the second as a testing data set.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population

Data from the CALGB 90206 study were used as a training data set for this analysis. Between October 2003 and
Cancer

January 1, 2014

July 2005, 732 patients were randomized to receive bevacizumab at a dose of 10 mg=kg intravenously every
2 weeks plus interferon-alpha (IFNA) at a dose of 9
million U subcutaneously 3 times weekly, or the same
dose and schedule of IFNA alone. Randomization was
stratified by nephrectomy status (yes vs no) and the
number of adverse prognostic factors (0, 1-2, or > 3)
using established risk criteria.12 This trial recruited previously untreated patients with clear cell mRCC with an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
of 0 to 2; adequate bone marrow, hepatic, cardiac, and renal function; and blood pressure controlled to < 160=90
mm Hg. Other eligibility criteria included a lack of central nervous system metastases, significant cardiac comorbidity, or a recent history of bleeding or clotting. The
primary endpoint was OS with investigator-assessed PFS
as a secondary endpoint.4,6
Data from a similar international phase 3 trial
(AVOREN) were used to confirm the results that were
observed in the CALGB 90206 study and served as the
testing data set. Between June 2004 and October 2005,
649 untreated patients with mRCC were randomized.
The AVOREN trial had similar eligibility criteria and
treatment regimens as CALGB 90206 except that the
AVOREN trial used IFNA=placebo for the control group
therapy and randomization was stratified by country and
the number of adverse prognostic factors (0, 1-2, or  3).
The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS.
Details regarding the 2 trials have been published elsewhere.4-7

Endpoints

The primary endpoint of the current analysis was OS,
which was defined as the time from randomization to the
date of death from any cause. PFS was defined as the time
from randomization to the date of disease progression or
death, whichever occurred first. The PFS rates at 3 months
and 6 months were defined as binary variables: a patient
experiencing disease progression at or before 3 months (or
6 months) was considered as experiencing an event. Otherwise, the patient was censored. Radiologic assessments
for disease progression were determined by investigator
assessment according to the Response Evaluation Criteria
In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria at baseline and every
8 weeks on the CALGB protocol. For the AVOREN trial,
radiological assessments of disease progression were performed every 8 weeks up to week 32 and then 12 weeks
thereafter until disease progression. Disease progression
was determined by both investigator assessment of

radiographs using the RECIST criteria and independent
radiological review.
Statistical Methods and Data Analysis

A similar methodological approach was used as reported
by Halabi et al.8 Landmark analyses of PFS at 3 months
and 6 months from randomization were performed to
minimize lead-time bias.13 In the training and testing data
sets, 53 patients and 41 patients and 133 patients and 109
patients, respectively, who died before 3 months and
6 months were excluded from the landmark analyses. The
Kaplan-Meier product-limit method was used to estimate
the OS distribution by the PFS rate at 3 months and at
6 months.14 The Cox proportional hazards model was
used to assess the significance of the effect of the PFS rate
at 3 months and at 6 months in predicting OS adjusting
for the stratification factors (prior nephrectomy [CALGB
90206], number of adverse risk factors assessed using
the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center criteria
[CALGB 90206 and AVOREN], and country [AVOREN trial]).15 In these models, progression at 3 months
and 6 months were considered to be binary variables. Prognostic variables included in the proportional hazards models were treatment arm, patient age, patient sex, presence of
bone metastases, and presence of lung metastases.4,5
The association between PFS (denoted as x) and OS
(denoted as y), was investigated in 1381 patients with
mRCC using a nonparametric statistic that estimates the
Kendall tau coefficient measure of association for bivariate
time-to-event outcomes subject to censoring.16,17 The
Kendall tau measures the dependence between the 2 endpoints. For any pair of patients, (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are
said to be concordant if the ranks for both PFS and OS
agree (ie, if both PFS1 is > PFS2 and OS1 is > OS2 or if
both PFS1 is < PFS2 and OS1 is < OS2). Otherwise the
pairs are considered to be discordant. The Kendall tau
coefficient ranges from 21 to 1, with 1 representing perfect agreement between the 2 rankings of the endpoints. If
the disagreement between the 2 rankings is perfect, the
coefficient will have a value of 2 1. We would expect the
coefficient to be approximately 0 if the PFS and OS endpoints are independent. The null sampling distribution of
the test statistic was approximated using 10,000 permutation replicates. Along with the bootstrap bias and standard
error (SE), an interval estimate (confidence limit [CL ]) of
the association parameter was constructed using adjusted
bootstrap percentile CLs based on 10,000 permutation
replicates.18
In addition, the adjusted association, a measurement
to assess the surrogacy of a time-to-event endpoint, was
54

computed.19 The null hypothesis to be tested was u 5 1
versus the alternative hypothesis that u is > 1. The
adjusted association is also a measure of correlation
between 2 censored variables; however, we applied the
adjusted association for 2 reasons. First, there is a definite
ordering between PFS and OS: PFS cannot be greater
than OS. The semicompeting risk paradigm fits properly
for this type of asymmetrical data structure. The semicompeting risk paradigm refers to a variation of the competing risk problem in which a terminal event (deaths)
censors a nonterminal event, but not vice versa. Second,
there has been a great interest in adjusting for the treatment effect in the validation of the surrogate endpoint.
The adjusted association first estimates the dependency
parameter within each arm and then aggregates the information by a weighted average. The larger association suggests a higher concordance among all comparable pairs
(by concordance, we mean whenever a patient has large
PFS, his=her OS duration also is large).
S-plus statistical software (version 8.0; Insightful
Corporation, Seattle, Wash) and R statistical software (R
Foundation, Vienna, Austria) were used for the data analyses and all statistical tests were 2-sided.
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics

A total of 1381 patients who were enrolled on the CALGB
and AVOREN trials were included in the current analysis.
Baseline clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1.
There were no differences noted in baseline clinical variables between the training and the testing data sets with
regard to sex, the presence of liver or lung metastases, and
the distribution of patients among risk groups as assigned
by established criteria.12 There were differences noted
between the 2 trials with regard to age, time from the diagnosis of metastatic disease to study entry, prior nephrectomy, percentage of patients with bone metastases, and
ECOG performance status. Patients who were randomized to CALGB 90206 were slightly older (median age, 62
years vs 61 years), had more bone metastases as the common disease site (29% vs 19%), and had better performance status (ECOG 0: 62% vs 41%) compared with
patients randomized to the AVOREN trial. Neither trial
was found to have imbalances between the experimental
and control arms.
Overall Survival

The median follow-up among the surviving patients in
the training and testing data sets was 62 months (95%
confidence interval [95% CI], 61 months-63 months)

and 39 months (95% CI, 38 months-40 months), respectively. A total of 704 and 599 progression events, respectively, and 627 and 444 deaths, respectively, were
observed in the training and testing data sets. The median
survival time was longer in the testing data set (AVOREN
trial; median, 22 months) compared with the training
data set (CALGB 90206; median, 18 months) (P 5 .06),
but this difference was not statistically significant when
adjusted for the stratification factors (Fig. 1) (stratified
log-rank P 5 .483).

patients who did not experience disease progression at 3
months was 25 months (95% CI, 22 months-29 months)

months (P < .0001). In the testing data set, the median
OS times were 26 months (95% CI, 24 months-30
months) and 6 months (95% CI, 5 months-9 months)
among patients who did not experience and patients who
did experience disease progression at 3 months, respectively
(P < .0001). The Kaplan-Meier product-limit survival
curves by PFS rate at 3 months are shown in Figure 2.
In the training data set, disease progression at
3 months was found to be predictive of OS (Table 2). The
adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for death was 2.6 (95% CI,
2.1-3.1; P < .0001) for patients who progressed at 3
months compared with patients who did not. In the testing data set, the adjusted HR for death was 3.4 (95% CI,
2.7-4.3; P < .0001).
Similar results were obtained with the use of PFS at
the 6-month landmark. In the training data set, the median survival time among patients who did not and did

experience disease progression at 6 months were 30
months (95% CI, 25 months -35 months) and 8 months
(95% CI, 6 months -10 months) (P < .0001) (Fig. 3
Top), respectively. In the testing data set, the median OS
times were 32 months (95% CI, 27 months -39 months)
and 10 months (95% CI, 8 months -13 months) (P
< .0001) (Fig. 3 Bottom), respectively, in patients with
mRCC who did not and did experience PFS at 6 months.
PFS at 6 months also was found to predict OS on
multivariable analysis (Table 3). Compared with patients
who did not develop disease progression at 6 months, the
adjusted HR for death for patients who progressed at 6
months was 2.8 (95% CI, 2.3-3.4; P < .0001) in the
training data set and 2.8 (95% CI, 2.2-3.5; P < .0001) in
the testing data set
Dependence Between PFS and OS

In the training data set, the estimated Kendall tau was
0.53 (95% CL, 0.49-0.56) (Table 4). Moreover, there
was strong evidence suggesting that OS and PFS are
statistically associated (P < .00001). In patients who
were treated with bevacizumab plus IFNA, the Kendall
tau between the OS and PFS was estimated to be
0.60 (95% CL, 0.55-0.63; P < .00001). In contrast,
the Kendall tau was 0.47 (95% CL, 0.40-0.52) in
patients who were treated with IFNA. This difference
was statistically significant. The results based on a
complete-case analysis (that is uncensored cases)
yielded similar results.
Using the testing data set, the Kendall tau between
OS and PFS was 0.50 (95% CL, 0.45-0.53; P < .00001).
56

Similarly, a higher coefficient of the Kendall tau was
observed in patients who were treated with bevacizumab
plus IFNA (Kendall tau of 0.58) compared with patients
who were treated with IFNA plus placebo (Kendall tau of
0.41) (Table 4).
Surrogacy Between PFS and OS

Using the training data set, the adjusted association was
3.145, which is a highly significant measure (P < .0001)
that was also confirmed in the testing data set. The
adjusted association was 2.80, which was also highly significant (P < .0001) and indicates that PFS is a surrogate
marker of OS.
DISCUSSION
In this analysis of 1381 patients with mRCC, PFS at 3
months and 6 months was found to be strongly predictive
of OS. In the training data set, CALGB 90206, the median OS was statistically significantly longer among
patients with mRCC who did not experience disease progression at 3 months (25 months) compared with patients
who did experience disease progression (6 months)
(P < .0001), with an adjusted HR for death of 2.6 for
patients who experienced disease progression at 3 months.
Similar results were observed in patients who did and did
not experience disease progression by 6 months. These
findings were initially confirmed using the 649 patients
with mRCC who were randomized on the testing data set,
the AVOREN trial. It is interesting to note that similar
results were also reported by Heng et al in a retrospective

(Cancer and Leukemia Group B [CALGB] 90206) and (Bottom) testing (AVOREN) data sets.

In addition, the adjusted association, a quantity with
which to assess the surrogacy of PFS, demonstrated that
PFS is a good surrogate of OS. Unlike the Kendall tau,
the adjusted association is computed after incorporating
the treatment assignment and, as is expected for a good
endpoint, the true association between the surrogate
(PFS) and true endpoint (OS) improved after adjustment
for the treatment effect. This association was confirmed in
the testing data set (AVOREN).
Before this analysis, the usefulness of PFS as a potential intermediate endpoint for OS in patients with mRCC
has been called into question, insomuch as the PFS results
of both CALGB 90206 and AVOREN did not translate

centers.11
In the current analysis, the relationship between PFS
and OS was moderate, with a Kendall tau of 0.53 and
0.50, respectively. However, the relationship was found to
be highly statistically significant (P < .00001). In fact, a
larger coefficient of the Kendall tau (0.60 and 0.58,
respectively, in the CALGB and AVOREN trials) was
observed in patients who were treated with bevacizumab
plus IFNA compared with patients treated with IFNA
alone (0.47 and 0.41, respectively, in the CALGB and
AVOREN trials), indicating a stronger dependence
between PFS and OS.

into a survival benefit. Further doubt regarding PFS as a
useful intermediate endpoint was raised by the recently
reported results of a study comparing tivozanib with
sorafenib, in which a PFS advantage in the experimental
tivozanib arm was linked to an apparent survival improvement in the sorafenib arm.4-7 Although these observations
could be explained by a weak association between PFS
and OS, an alternative explanation is that the association
between these 2 endpoints is strong but was obscured by
multiple sequential salvage therapies after disease progres-

sion. The latter explanation appears to be the case in the 2
analyzed bevacizumab trials because 62% and 54%,
respectively of patients randomized on IFNA or bevacizumab plus IFNA on CALGB 90206 received subsequent
therapies. Although some investigators have made similar
claims in the past,6,7 to our knowledge this is the first formal statistical analysis of prospectively obtained clinical
trial data supporting such a view and supports regulatory
agency approval of bevacizumab as a useful therapy in
patients with mRCC.

Although the results of the current analysis suggest
that PFS may be used as a surrogate endpoint in trials of
patients with mRCC using VEGF pathway-directed
therapies, it is important to mention that it was not possible to evaluate the PFS endpoint for surrogacy using the
Prentice criteria because bevacizumab did not demonstrate a prolongation in OS in either trial.20 Several
authors, however, have used different approaches to the
validation of surrogate endpoints (such as individual-level
surrogacy based on individual patient data).21-23 Thus, an
intermediate endpoint of OS may be of great use in clinical trials, even if it does not meet Prentice criteria.
There are several strengths to the current analysis.
First, the data were obtained from randomized multiinstitutional phase 3 trials that prospectively enrolled treated
patients and collected data of high quality. Second, both
trials had similar eligibility criteria and recruited previously
untreated patients with mRCC to receive treatment with
the same experimental regimen (bevacizumab and IFNA)
and the same control arm was used (IFNA alone). Third,
the results of the current analysis were confirmed in an independent data set. Finally, individual patient data were
used in this analysis. However, the main limitation of the
current study is the finding that patients enrolled in these
studies were required to have certain eligibility criteria to
be deemed appropriate for participation in a clinical trial.
Thus, the results of the current study cannot be generalized
to the entire population of patients with mRCC and may
or may not be generalizable to other VEGF pathwaydirected or non-VEGF pathway-directed therapies.
Nevertheless, there exists an unmet need for validated surrogate endpoints in clinical trials of patients with
mRCC. Although OS remains the regulatory gold standard, a pragmatic and reliable intermediate endpoint, especially in the era of multiple available therapies and
prolonged OS, is critical. The results of the current analysis demonstrate that PFS at 3 months and at 6 months
predicted OS in patients with mRCC who were treated
with bevacizumab and IFNA and suggest that PFS may be

an appropriate intermediate endpoint for OS. However,
these findings need to be validated in patients with
mRCC who are treated with VEGF pathway-directed
agents in general.
