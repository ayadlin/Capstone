ABSTRACT
Malignant gliomas are highly proliferative and invasive neoplasms where total
surgical resection is often impossible and effective local radiation therapy difficult.
Consequently, there is a need to develop a greater understanding of the molecular
events driving invasion and to identify novel treatment targets. Using microarray
analysis comparing normal brain samples and mesenchymal glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM), we identified over 140 significant genes involved in cell migration and
invasion. The cofilin (CFL) pathway, which disassembles actin filaments, was highly
up-regulated compared to normal brain. Up-regulation of LIM domain kinase 1 and 2
(LIMK1/2), that phosphorylates and inactivates cofilin, was confirmed in an additional
independent data set comparing normal brain to GBM. We identified and utilized
two small molecule inhibitors BMS-5 and Cucurbitacin I directed against the cofilin
regulating kinases, LIMK1 and LIMK2, to target this pathway. Significant decreases
in cell viability were observed in glioma cells treated with BMS-5 and Cucurbitacin I,
while no cytotoxic effects were seen in normal astrocytes that lack LIMK. BMS-5 and
Cucurbitacin I promoted increased adhesion in GBM cells, and decreased migration
and invasion. Collectively, these data suggest that use of LIMK inhibitors may provide
a novel way to target the invasive machinery in GBM.

and dysregulation of intrinsic molecular motors of cancer
cells which result in rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton
and subsequent enhanced cancer cell motility. Recently, we
have focused our research efforts on the Rho GTPase family
of molecular motors in the study of glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM), a highly infiltrative and invasive cancer of the
brain [1–3]. We have shown that GBM cells demonstrate
both mesenchymal migration predominantly through Rac1
activation and amoeboid migration through Rho/Rho kinase
(ROCK) activation [4, 5].

INTRODUCTION
Cancer invasion remains a significant cause of patient
related morbidity and mortality, and poses challenges for
locally directed therapies such as surgery and radiation
therapy. The molecular mechanisms underlying cancer
invasion are not completely understood, but include the
elaboration of proteolytic enzymes by tumour cells which
degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) macromolecules,
tumour cell:tumour cell and tumour cell:ECM interactions,

Downsteam members of the Rho-GTPase
pathway are critical intracellular mediators of the actinmodeling events that control directional cell migration
and are frequently dysregulated in numerous neoplasms
including GBM [3, 6–9]. Previously, we and others have
demonstrated that dyregulated phosphorylation of the
downstream protein Coﬁlin (CFL) signiﬁcantly increased
tumour migration and invasion in vivo [10–13].
CFL phosphorylation is dynamically regulated by
LIM kinases (LIMK) and testis-specific kinases (TESK1
and TESK2) that phosphorylate CFL at serine-3 (S3)
residues that inactivate CFL by blocking CFLʹs actin
binding ability [14–16]. The phosphatases Slingshot
and Chronophilin activate CFL through localization
dependent dephosphorylation [17]. The factors known to
phosphorylate and dephosphorylate CFL to enable CFL
to work on downstream effector molecules leading to cell
migration collectively comprise the CFL pathway.
Given that LIMK1 is a downstream effector of
both the Rac and Rho pathways, which respectively
regulate mesenchymal and amoeboid migration, LIMK
is likely a key regulator in both modes of cell migration.
Interestingly, abnormal expression of LIMK has been
implicated in numerous malignancies such as prostate
cancer, invasive breast cancer and melanoma [18–21].
In the current study, we identified aberrant LIMK
in a gene expression array of invasion/migration genes
comparing normal brain to samples from highly malignant
and invasive GBM. Here we investigate the role of
LIMK in GBM migration and invasion and evaluate if
LIMK small molecule inhibitors are viable candidates
for preclinical targeting of GBM invasiveness. To our
knowledge, an in-depth study of the role of LIMK in
glioma motility and invasion has not been performed
previously.

filaments (namely LIMK1, LIMK2, CFL, CAP1) was
highly upregulated compared to normal brain (Figure 1B,
P<0.05). Of great interest we identified up-regulation of
LIM domain kinase 1 and 2 (LIMK1/2) that phosphorylates
and inactivates CFL in an additional data set comparing
normal brain to GBM (Figure 1C). Lastly, we observed
robust expression of LIMK1 in several well-characterized
GBM cell lines (U87, T98G and U118) and phosphoCFL in cell lines that expressed LIMK1 (Figure 1D).
All phospho-CFL lines expressed LIMK1, but we did not
observe phospho-CFL positive cell lines that were LIMK1
negative (Figure 1D).

LIMK is of prognostic value
CFL and its role in migration and invasion have
been previously implicated in GBM biology, however
the role and potential prognostic value of its upstream
regulators, LIMK1/2, are still incompletely elucidated.
Towards this end, we queried if LIMK1 and LIMK2
had prognostic value in a clinically annotated dataset
(REpository of Molecular BRAin Neoplasia DaTa/
REMBRANDT) [25]. Based on gene expression, glioma
patients (grades II–IV) with downregulated LIMK1
and LIMK2 had significantly better overall survival
(Figures 2A-B, p>0.05). We next queried the prognostic
value of LIMK1 and LIMK2 in GBM – the worst
outcome group. Using DNA copy number analysis,
patients with LIMK1 gains (> 3 copies of a gene) but
not LIMK2 had a worse overall survival (Figures 2C-D,
p < 0.05). Lastly, as GBM is comprised of 5 molecular
subtypes (Proneural, Neural, Classical, Mesenchymal,
and the G-CIMP positive subgroup), we compared
LIMK1 and LIMK2 among the varying subgroups of
GBM from the TCGA dataset and observed no subtype
differences (Figures 2E-F). In summary, LIMK1 and
LIMK2 down-regulation correlates with better overall
survival in glioma patients; and DNA copy number
gains of LIMK1 correlate with worse survival in GBM
patients.

RESULTS
Identification of Cofilin pathway dysregulation in
GBM
Using gene-expression data from The Cancer
Genome Atlas data set (TCGA) on the Affymetrix U133
platform we performed microarray analysis comparing
10 normal brain samples versus 51 mesenchymal
GBMs. We initially selected one subtype of GBM, the
mesenchymal GBM, in our discovery screen to reduce the
impact of GBM subtype heterogeneity. The mesenchymal
subtype also lacks immediate actionable targets, and is
associated with a poor prognosis [22–24]. We compared
400 invasion/migration genes – using the gene-ontology
terms invasion and migration – represented by 700 probesets. We identified over 141 significant genes with a 1.5
fold change (p-value < 0.05, and a false discovery rate
q < 0.05) compared to normal brain (Figure 1A). Of the
141 genes, the cofilin pathway, which disassembles actin

GBMs are highly heterogeneous cancers
phenotypically and genotypically characterized by cells
demonstrating central pseudopalisading and infiltrative
tumor cells at the interface between solid tumour and
normal brain. Spatial and regional heterogeneity of many
markers of GBM including oncogenes have been reported;
however the spatial heterogeneity of LIMK1 and its target
CFL are poorly characterized. Using a well-characterized
tissue microarray of 20 GBM patients for which a tumour
core and a matched tumour periphery sample were
available we undertook immunohistochemical (IHC)
analysis of LIMK1 and pCFL. We observed significant

expression of LIMK1 at the periphery of the GBMs
compared to the core (11/20 in the periphery versus 2/20
in the core) (Figure 3A). On average 43% of the cells
stained positively for LIMK1 in the periphery compared
to only 12% of cells that were positive in the tumour core
(Figure 3B, p<0.05). Similarly, we observed significantly
more expression of p-CFL in the periphery of the GBM
compared to the core (7/16 in the periphery versus 2/16
in the core) (Figure 3C). On average 42% of the cells
stained positively for p-CFL in the periphery compared
to only 15% of cells that were positive in the tumour core
(Figure 3D, p<0.05). We next performed co-expression
analysis in which we had matching LIMK1 and pCFL
protein expression from the same cells in the centre and
periphery (from serial sections of our IHC analysis of
LIMK1 and pCFL). We observed a correlation between
positive pCFL and positive LIMK1 expression in the
tumour periphery, (Figure 3E, Fischerʹs Exact Test,
p=0.0001). Likewise, we observed a correlation between
negative pCFL and negative LIMK1 expression in the
tumor centre, (Figure 3E, p=0.0001).

observed significant decrease in cell viability in U87
and T98G cells using doses of 10–20 μM BMS-5
from days 3–5 with no effect at day 1 (Figure 5A-B,
p<0.05). Similarly, Cucurbitacin I treatment resulted
in a significant reduction in cell viability in U87 cells
and T98G cells from 100nM–10μM from days 3–5
(Figure 5C-D, P<0.05). Reduction of cell viability
correlated with increased apoptosis as measured by
cleaved caspase 3/7 enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) (Figure 5E-F, p>0.05). We previously
demonstrated that normal human astrocytes (NHAs)
do not express p-CFL and LIMK1 [13]. We tested
several low and high doses of BMS-5 and Cucurbitacin
I and observed no cytotoxic effect on NHAs at low
doses suggesting our small molecule inhibitors act
specifically on tumor cells expressing LIMK1 and
pCFL. Interestingly, reduced cell viability was observed
in NHAs at high doses outside the potential therapeutic
range of these molecules (50 μM for BMS-5 and 20 μM
for Cucurbitacin I) (Supplemental Figure 1A-B).

BMS-5 and Cucurbitacin I inhibit GBM cell
migration, invasion

Phospho-cofilin is attenuated by a LIM kinase
inhibitor and Cucurbitacin

Having established that there was an antitumor effect on GBM cells with two small molecule
inhibitors we queried whether there were pro-adhesion,
anti-migratory and anti-invasion effects. Both BMS5 (10  μM) and Cucurbitacin I (100 nM) promoted
increased adhesion in U87 and T98G cells on various
surface coatings (Figure 6A-B, p<0.05). Interestingly,
BMS-5 and Cucurbitacin I reduced migration rates of
both U87 and T98G cells (Figures 6C-D, p < 0.05).
Next, to assess invasion, we performed a trans-well
migration assay and observed significant reduction
of invasion of T98G and U87 cells by BMS-5 and
Cucurbitacin I (Figure 6E-F, p<0.05). The adhesion,
migration and invasion assays were performed at time
points less than 24 hr at which times the drugs do not
alter cell number or viability.

Currently there is a lack of therapeutic agents
targeting invasion and migration in GBM and there is
a need for actionable targets involving these pathways.
Having established that pCFL plays an integral role in
GBM invasion, we explored how to target this pathway
using small molecule inhibitors [12, 13, 26]. We tested
LIMK1/2 and p-CFL inhibitors, BMS-5 and Cucurbitacin
I. Both have been shown to inhibit phosphorylation
of CFL with BMS-5 inhibiting LIMK1/LIMK2 and
Cucurbitacin I inhibiting cofilin phosphorylation
through an unknown mechanism. We tested both
compounds on two well-established GBM cell line
models, U87 and T98G cell, both of which express
LIMK1 and p-CFL. Both BMS-5 and Cucurbitacin I
significantly inhibited cofilin phosphorylation at 10μM
and 100nM respectively in U87 cells, using linear
protein quantification by chemiluminescent densitometry
(Figure 4A-B, p<0.05). Similar results for both BMS-5
and Cucurbitacin I were seen in T98G cells where
cofilin phosphorylation was inhibited at 10μM and
100nM respectively and was significant based on linear
protein quantification by chemiluminescent densitometry
(Figure 4C-D, p<0.05).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we have shown by transcriptional
profiling of a dataset of over 400 genes that the CFL
pathway is dysregulated in GBM, and that LIMK is
upregulated in GBM using the REMBRANDT brain
tumour dataset. From a prognostic perspective, patients
with low LIMK1/2 expression had an overall better
survival than those with high LIMK1/2 expression. Using
a TMA with 20 patient matched samples of tumour core
and rim regions, we demonstrate that LIMK1 and pCFL
are more highly expressed at the tumour rim and periphery
than in the core. We have shown that the LIM kinase
inhibitor, Cucurbitacin, diminishes the phosphorylation of
CFL at therapeutically achievable drug doses, and leads to

a variety of cellular processes including cell migration,
cancer cell invasion, metastasis, and neurodevelopmental
disorders (e.g. Williamʹs syndrome) [28, 29].
LIMK1/2 are strategically located at a convergence
point of upstream signals from a number of Rho GTPase
family members [30]. The most important of these include
Cdc42/Rac/Pak1, 2 and 4; Rho/ROCK/I&II; and Cdc42
MRCKa. From this convergence of signals, ROCKI and II,
and PAK have been shown to phosphorylate and activate
LIMK. LIMK1/2 then serve to phosphorylate CFL.
However, there are phosphatases of CFL such as SSH and
Chronophilin which counteract the phosphorylation and
inactivation of CFL.
The gene for LIMK1 is localized to 7q11.23,
whereas the gene for LIMK2 is found at 22q12.2 [31].
Mice in which Limk1 is deleted show defects in synaptic
structure and spine development [32]. Interestingly,
Williams syndrome, a condition characterized by cognitive
impairment, learning difficulties, and cardiovascular
disease, is associated with gene deletions at 7q11.2
including the gene for LIMK1 [29]. Mice with gene
deletion of Limk2 demonstrate impaired spermatogenesis
[33]. When double Limk1/Limk2 null mice are examined,
these mice are viable, and show significant defects in
synaptogenesis not seen in the single knockouts [32]. [34]
While the genes for LIMK1/2 do not appear to be the
target of mutations in human cancers, the subversion of
their expression may be important in the process of cancer
cell migration and metastasis [31]. In this regard, the
balance between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated
CFL, as would be regulated in part by LIMK1/2, may
be critically important players. To support this concept,
overexpression of LIMK1 has been described previously
in malignant melanoma, breast cancer, and prostate
epithelial cells/cancer [18, 21, 35]. When LIMK1 is
overexpressed in breast cancer cells, increased invasion
and metastasis of breast cancer cells are promoted [36].
Several reports have shown that modulating LIMK1
expression by antisense, by overexpression of LIMK1 by
a dominant negative form, or by knockdown of LIMK2
by ribozyme-mediated knockdown will inhibit cancer
motility, invasion, and metastasis [18, 36, 37].
There are a number of negative regulators
of LIMK1/2. SSH reduces LIMK activity by
dephosphorylation of transphosphorylated residues;
LATS1 reduces LIMK1 activity; and Caspase 3 produces
an inactive form of LIMK by truncation at Asp240 [38]
[39]. To date, several small molecule inhibitors have been
produced against the LIM kinases. These are generally
phenyl-substituted primidines with 1-2 additional elements
at the heterocyclic scaffold core [38, 39]. These were
originally synthesized by Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS),
and are known as the BMS compounds. Compound

BMS-3 was shown to inhibit cofilin phosphorylation in a
dose-dependent manner in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
cells [40]. It has also been used in MCF7 breast cancer cells
and shows sensitization to doxorubicin, thus paving the
way towards significant potential for more effective drug
combination therapy [41]. In our study, we used BMS5 which is a LIMK inhibitor without kinase selectivity
[38]. The issue with some of the BMS compounds is
their adverse effects on microtubule formation [41].
Cucurbitacin belongs to a class of biochemical compounds
that plants such as pumpkins and gourds use to defend
themselves against herbivores [42]. They are classified
as steroids and often occur as glycosides. Structurally,
Cucurbitacins are found as tetacyclic cucurbitane nuleus
skeletons (triterpenes). Many of the cucurbitacins are
known to be cytotoxic. Of the more than 30 cucurbitacins
that have been identified, the ones most widely used for
in vitro and in vivo cancer inhibition studies have been
Cucurbitacin E, B, D, and I [42]. In our study we used
Cucurbitacin I and noted a significant anti-tumour effect in
vitro [42]. Unlike BMS-5, Cucurbitacin is not as selective
an inhibitor of LIMK given its known effects on the signal
transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), cyclooxygenase-2, and the apoptosis machinery. Recently,
Cucurbitacin I was shown to inhibit JAK2/STAT3 and
induce autophagy and apoptosis in glioblastoma cells in
vitro and in flank xenograft studies [43]. These results
indicate that Cucurbitacin I likely inhibits multiple
signaling pathways and have functional effects on glioma
cells in addition to its inhibition of migration and invasion
described in the current study.
One of the major hurdles to treating GBM is failure
of promising drugs to cross the BBB. Accordingly, we
utilized a Multi-Parameter Optimization (MPO) algorithm
to identify compounds with the physical properties to
penetrate the BBB [44]. With the data from the MPO
algorithm, BMS-5 and Cucurbitacin are predicted to have
suboptimal BBB penetration in their native state (data
not shown). Although beyond the scope of the current
study manuscript, BMS-5 and Cucurbitacin could be
delivered at higher concentrations to intracranial gliomas
using techniques which focally disrupt the BBB such
as Magnetic Resonance guided Focused ultrasound
(MRgFUS) as we have shown in previous studies [45–47].
While the use of targeted Rho-GTPase inhibitors
has not become mainstream therapy for any cancer at this
time, there are several potential opportunities to increase
their usage against human cancers. These include targeting
the Rho activation with GEF inhibitors, inhibiting Rhoassociated kinase activity, inhibiting MRCK activity, and
p21-activated kinase activity. In combination, they may
hold more promise than as stand-alone agents given the
known redundancy of the elements in this system.

Cell lines and cell culture and inhibitors

Caspase 3/7 Assay

Human glioma cell lines T98G and U87 were
purchased from the ATCC (American Type Culture
Collection) and were maintained in Dulbeccoʹs modified
Eagleʹs medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% of
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and cultured at
37°C, 5% carbon dioxide in a humidified chamber. NHAs
were purchased from Lonza (Lonza, Walkersville, MD)
and maintained in Astrocyte Growth Media (Lonza) containing 2.5% FBS, 0.1% ascorbic acid, 0.5% recombinant
human epidermal growth factor, 0.1% GA-1000, 0.25%
insulin, and 1% L-glutamine (Lonza). LIMK inhibitor
was purchased from SYNKINASE (SYN-1024 BMS-5)
and Cucurbitacin I was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(C-4493). Both drugs were dissolved in DMSO making a
master stock of 1 mM and used at doses and times points
listed in the Results section.

Caspase 3/7 activity levels as a measure of apoptosis
were measured using the Apo-One® Homogeneous
Caspase 3/7 assay (Promega Corp., USA) that provides
a profluorescent substrate and a cell lysis/activity buffer
for Caspase 3/7 (DEVDase) activity. Briefly, 5,000 cells
were seeded into 96 well plates and treated with varying
doses of LIMK inhibitor BMS and Cucurbitactin I. After
48–72 hours of incubation with drug, 100 μL of Apo-One
was seeded in each well, incubated for 3 hours and then
fluorescence levels measured (485Ex/527Em).

Cell proliferation assay
Cell proliferation was assessed by the colorimetric
MTS assay using the Promega CellTiter 96 AQueous One
Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison,
WI). Cells were seeded on 96-well plates at a density of
1000–5000 cells in 100 μl of culture medium containing
10% FBS per well. After one hour of incubation with
20 μl of MTS reagent per well, absorbance at 490 nm
was measured using the VERSA max microplate reader
(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at the specified time
points. Experiments were repeated three times with eight
replicates.

Western blot analysis
Cell lysates were prepared by harvesting cells in
RIPA lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) with
a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics,
Indianapolis, IN). Protein concentration was determined
using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo
Scientific, Rockford, IL) as per the manufacturerʹs
protocol, and 30 μg of protein extracts were mixed with
6X SDS sample buffer (Tris pH 6.8, 1.7% SDS, glycerol
and β-mercaptoethanol). Lysates were resolved on a 10%
SDS-polyacrylamide gel of 1.5 mm thickness. Proteins
were then transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride
transfer membranes (Pall Corporation, Pensacola, FL),
and subsequently blocked with 5% skim milk in TBS-T
adjusted to pH 7.4 (20 mM Tris aminomethane, 150
mM NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 hour at room
temperature. The membranes were immunoblotted
overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies. After incubation
with a primary antibody, the membranes were incubated
at room temperature for 1 hour with a secondary antibody,
horseradish peroxidise-conjugated Protein A (1: 5000;
GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) or a horseradish
peroxidise-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin
G antibody (1:5000; Cell Signaling Technology), and
bound primary antibodies were visualized using Western
Lightning Plus-ECL (PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, MA).
Relative densitometric ratios of average expression of
LIMK1/2, CFL, and pCFL to that of actin are shown
and were quantified using chemiluminescence signal
in the linear range on an Alpha Imager imaging system.
Antibodies used were as follows: Phospho Cofilin
(p-serine 3): Rabbit polyclonal: 1:5000: SAB4504370100UG. Cofilin: Rabbit polyclonal: 1:5000 Sigma-Aldrich
SAB4500148-100UG. LIMK1: Rabbit polyclonal: 1:1000

Cell adhesion assay
96-well plates were coated with different ECM
proteins (laminin [LN] and fibronectin [FN] at 10 μg/ml,
collagen type IV [CL] at 50 μg/ml, and vitronectin [VN]
at 1μg/ml) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS
at 4°C overnight. Purified human ECM proteins – LN, CL,
VN and FN – were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The
unbound sites were blocked with 0.1% BSA in PBS for
one hour at 37°C. Cells treated with Cucurbitacin I and
LIMK inhibitor were collected 12 hours after treatment
and were resuspended in serum-free medium and plated
on the coated plate at 5×104 cells per well. After 3 hours
incubation at 37°C in a 5% carbon dioxide humidified
chamber to allow cells to adhere, unattached cells were
removed by washing with PBS, and the remaining cells
attached to the ECM on the bottom of the plates were
fixed with 4% PFA for 15 minutes at room temperature.
After washing with PBS three times, cells were stained
with 0.5% crystal violet for 10 minutes. The excess stain
was washed with water and cells were allowed to airdry overnight. The crystal violet bound to the attached
cells was solubilized in 200 μl of 1% SDS per well, and
absorbance at 595 nm was measured using the VERSA
max microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Experiments
were repeated three times with five replicates.

serum for one hour at room temperature. The tissues were
incubated with a rabbit polyclonal p-CFL antibody (SigmaAldrich, SAB4504370-100UG) and anti-LIMK1 antibody
(Sigma-Aldrich HPA028516-100UL) both at 1:100
dilutions at 4°C overnight. Subsequently, the tissues were
incubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector
Laboratories Inc.) for one hour at room temperature. For
detection, the ABC kit (Vector Laboratories Inc.) and DAB
chromagen (Sigma-Aldrich) were used. Finally, the tissues
were counterstained in hematoxylin (Fisher Scientific Inc.,
Fair Lawn, NJ), dehydrated in ethanol, washed in xylene,
and mounted on glass slides using Permount (Fisher
Scientific Inc.). P-CFL and LIMK1 positivity and staining
were independently and scored by neuropathologist Dr
Sidney Croul, who was blinded to the origin of the samples.

Cell migration was assessed by the microliterscale radial monolayer assay using 10-well Teflon-coated
glass slides (CSM Inc., Phoenix, AZ). Cells treated with
Cucurbitacin I and LIMK inhibitor were collected 12 hours
after siRNA transfection and were seeded through a cell
sedimentation manifold (CSM Inc.) at 3000 cells per well.
After 6 hours of incubation, manifolds were removed,
and a best-fit circle circumscribing the cells was drawn as
baseline. The cells were allowed to migrate for 24 hours
in culture medium, and another circle circumscribing the
newly migrated cells was drawn. The average migration
rate (μm/24 hours) was determined by the increase of the
diameter of the circle beyond the baseline diameter of the
cells during a 24-hour period. Experiments were repeated
three times with six replicates.

Microarray and Copy Number Data
Glioma and GBM mRNA and copy number
expression data was obtained from the Repository of
Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (REMBRANDT, https://
caintegrator.nci.nih.gov/rembrandt/) [25] and analysis was
performed using Rembrandt online statistical software.
Normal brain versus mesenchymal GBMs were obtained
from the TCGA data portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/
tcga/) including 10 normal brain and 51 mesenchymal
GBMs as defined from the Verhaak et al. study [22].
Affymetrix gene expression profiles on the U133A
platform were downloaded as raw CEL files. CEL files
were then imported into Affymetrix Expression Console
(Version 1.1) and gene level analysis (CORE content)
was performed. Arrays were quantile normalized (RMA
sketch normalization) and summarized using PLIER
with PM-GCBG background correction followed by a
COMBAT analysis (combatting batch correction) using
the statistical software from the Broad Institute (GenePattern). Probesets were annotated according to the human
genome build HG19 (GRCh37). Gene lists involving cell
migration and invasion were extracted for differential gene
expression analysis using gene-ontology terms (GO-terms)
for invasion and migration: Invasion (GO:0044409) Neuron
Migration (GO:0001764), Glial Migration (GO:0008347),
Mesenchyme Migration (GO:0090131), forebrain cell
migration (GO:0021885), cerebral cortex migration
(GO:0021795). Using these terms we generated a list of 400
genes involved in core invasion and migration processes.
Significant genes were identified as genes differentially
expressed by 1.5 fold, having a q-value less than 5%
(false discovery rate) and a p-value less than 0.05 using
a significance of microarray analysis (SAM) pairwise test.

Cell invasion assay
Cell invasion ability was assessed using BD BioCoat
Matrigel Invasion Chambers consisting of Transwellprecoated Matrigel membrane filter inserts with 8 μm
pores in 24-well tissue culture plates (BD Biosciences,
Bedford, MA). 5×104 of cells treated with both inhibitors
were collected 12 hours after treatment and seeded onto
the top of the chamber in DMEM with 0.1% FBS, and the
bottom chamber was filled with DMEM with 10% FBS as
a chemoattractant. The cells were incubated for 12 hours at
37°C in a 5% carbon dioxide humidified chamber to allow
them to migrate through the filter membrane. After 12 hours
of incubation, non-invading cells were removed from the
upper surface of the membrane using cotton swabs, and the
filter membranes were fixed with 4% PFA for 15 minutes.
Subsequently, the filter membranes were mounted on glass
slides using Vectashield with DAPI (Vector Laboratories
Inc., Burlingame, CA) for nuclear staining. Fluorescence
was visualized and images were taken using a fluorescence
microscope and quantified using Image J software.
Experiments were repeated three times in triplicate.

Tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry
A glioma tissue microarray (TMA) containing
tumour core (TC) and periphery (P) samples go GBM
was obtained from Dr. Michael Berens (TGen, Phoenix
AZ). The TMA used in this study consisted of a total of 20
matched TC and P GBMs spotted as 1 mm cores.
The TMA and GBM sample slides were
deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in ethanol.
Then, antigen retrieval was achieved by microwave
pressure-cooking in sodium citrate solution adjusted to
pH 6.0, followed by blocking of endogenous peroxidase
activity using 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for
20 minutes. Blocking was performed using 10% donkey

mean reported where appropriate. Where appropriate,
direct comparisons were conducted using an unpaired
two-tailed Studentʹs t-test. Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
was conducted for multi-group comparisons followed by
a post-Dunnetts test (groups compared to one control
group) or post-Tukey (to identify differences among subgroups). Significance was defined as p < 0.05. KaplanMeier survival curve analysis was performed and the
survival was statistically compared by the log-rank test. A
probability value less than 0.05 was considered significant.
Blood brain barrier permeability predictions were
performed using the CNS multiparameter optimization
(CNS MPO) algorithm, an in silico BBB permeability
prediction model used to prioritize compounds for drug
development in CNS diseases [44]. Physiochemical
properties used in the analysis were estimated using
Advanced Chemistry Development Labs (ACD/Labs)
PhysChem Suite.
