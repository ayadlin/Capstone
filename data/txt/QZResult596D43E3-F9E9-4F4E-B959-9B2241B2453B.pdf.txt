Abstract
Rapidly growing glycolytic tumors require energy and intracellular pH (pHi) homeostasis through the activity of two major
monocarboxylate transporters, MCT1 and the hypoxia-inducible
MCT4, in intimate association with the glycoprotein CD147/
BASIGIN (BSG). To further explore and validate the blockade of
lactic acid export as an anticancer strategy, we disrupted, via zinc
ﬁnger nucleases, MCT4 and BASIGIN genes in colon adenocarcinoma (LS174T) and glioblastoma (U87) human cell lines. First,
we showed that homozygous loss of MCT4 dramatically sensitized cells to the MCT1 inhibitor AZD3965. Second, we demonstrated that knockout of BSG leads to a decrease in lactate
transport activity of MCT1 and MCT4 by 10- and 6-fold, respectively. Consequently, cells accumulated an intracellular pool of
lactic and pyruvic acids, magniﬁed by the MCT1 inhibitor decreasing further pHi and glycolysis. As a result, we found that these

glycolytic/MCT-deﬁcient cells resumed growth by redirecting their
metabolism toward OXPHOS. Third, we showed that in contrast
with parental cells, BSG-null cells became highly sensitive to
phenformin, an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I. Phenformin addition to these MCT-disrupted cells in normoxic and
hypoxic conditions induced a rapid drop in cellular ATP-inducing
cell death by "metabolic catastrophe." Finally, xenograft analysis
conﬁrmed the deleterious tumor growth effect of MCT1/MCT4
ablation, an action enhanced by phenformin treatment. Collectively, these ﬁndings highlight that inhibition of the MCT/BSG
complexes alone or in combination with phenformin provides an
acute anticancer strategy to target highly glycolytic tumors. This
genetic approach validates the anticancer potential of the MCT1
and MCT4 inhibitors in current development. Cancer Res; 75(1);

Introduction

precursors (6, 9, 10). However, the high glycolytic rate associated
with a production of lactic acid rapidly creates a hostile acidic and
hypoxic microenvironment that induces dissemination of metastatic variants (11). Hypoxia via HIF1 controls intracellular pH
(pHi) by inducing the membrane-bound carbonic anhydrases IX
and XII (12–14) and a major Hþ/lactate symporter, MCT4
(15–17). Considering the key role of glycolysis in "glucoseaddicted" tumors, targeting this bioenergetic and anabolic pathway represents an attractive therapeutic approach (18–22).
The regulation of pHi is a key determinant for many physiologic
processes and is certainly essential in maintaining a high glycolytic
rate. For this reason, we have exploited our knowledge on lactic acid
transport to evaluate the impact of its inhibition as an anticancer
strategy (21, 23). Transport of lactate across the plasma membrane
is carried out by a family of solute carrier family 16 (SLC16), or
monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) in which four (MCT1-4)
catalyze bidirectional proton-coupled transport of lactate. MCT1
is induced by Myc and MCT4 by HIF1, and are upregulated in
several cancers (17, 24). These two transporters require an accessory
glycoprotein CD147/BASIGIN (BSG) for proper folding, stability,
and trafﬁcking to the cell surface (25, 26). BSG is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that has been reported to be overexpressed
in different metastatic tumor cells (24, 26). Thus targeting BSG/
MCTs complex using a pharmacologic inhibitor or shRNA-mediated knockdown was reported to impair the in vitro and in vivo
growth of pancreatic tumor cells (27), Ras-transformed ﬁbroblasts,
colon adenocarcinoma (21), and Myc-induced human malignancies (22), which suggested that blocking lactic acid export provides
an efﬁcient metabolic therapy to limit tumor cell growth (14).

Unlike in normal differentiated cells, most rapidly growing
tumors rely primarily on glycolysis as a major source of energy
even in the presence of oxygen, which is referred to as "fermentative glycolysis" (1). This phenomenon, conﬁrmed through the
use of 18Fluoro-deoxyglucose PET (2), is now considered as a key
metabolic hallmark of invasive cancers (3). Recent studies linked
the Warburg effect to metabolic reprogramming, in which oncogenic transformation, as well as the transcriptional activity of cMyc and the hypoxia-inducible factor1 (HIF1), induce glycolytic
activity (4–6) associated to parallel inhibition of the pyruvate
dehydrogenase (PDH) complex (7, 8).
Even if fermentative glycolysis generates only a few ATP
molecules considering the large amounts of glucose consumed,
this pathway appears to be well ﬁtted for rapid growth of normal
and cancer cells, as it provides not only energy, but also anabolic

In the present study, we explored further the mechanism by
which blockade of lactic acid export exerts cytostasis and could be
turned into a strategy to provoke tumor cell death. Because there is
no pharmacologic inhibitor for MCT4, we designed genetic
experiments to knockout, using the zinc ﬁnger nuclease (ZFN),
either MCT4 or BSG or both in two glycolytic tumor models,
the colon adenocarcinoma (LS174T), and glioblastoma (U87)
human cell lines. We demonstrated that tumor cells grown in
normoxia or hypoxia survived the MCT blockade by reactivating
OXPHOS. This key ﬁnding prompted us to test the sensitivity of
these cells to phenformin a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor.
Indeed, the two tumor cell lines that survive MCT blockade with
minimal growth rapidly enter into "ATP crisis" and die in vitro
and in vivo upon treatment with phenformin.

concentration measured every 22 seconds for 3 minutes. Different
agents were then injected into the wells at a ﬁnal concentration of
10 mmol/L of glucose (Sigma), 300 nmol/L of MCT1i, 50 mmol/L
of phenformin (Sigma), and 1 mmol/L of rotenone (Sigma). After
each addition, four data points of 3 minutes were taken to
determine the OCR (pMoles O2/minutes) and ECAR (mpH/
minute). The protein concentration was measured to normalize
the OCR and ECAR values.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean  SD. Each experiment was performed at least three times and the number of experiments is
represented by n. Statistical analysis was done with the unpaired
Student t test. Differences between groups were considered statistically signiﬁcant when P < 0.05.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and hypoxia
Colon adenocarcinoma LS174T cells (kindly provided by
Dr. Van de Wetering, Oxford University, Oxford, United Kingdom), and glioblastoma U87 cells (kindly provided by Dr. Adrian
Harris, Oxford University) were grown in DMEM (Gibco)
supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (10 U/mL), and streptomycin (10 mg/mL). Chinese hamster lung CCL39 ﬁbroblasts
obtained from the ATCC and the CCL39-derived mutants
impaired either in respiration (res) or in glycolysis (gly), were
obtained as described (28, 29) and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 7.5% FBS. Cell lines were identiﬁed by DNA
ﬁngerprint and STR loci (DSMZ). With the exception of "Seahorse" experiments, all in vitro studies were performed in parallel,
under normoxia or hypoxia 1% O2 as reported (21) to fully
express glycolytic enzymes, particularly MCT4.
Animal studies
The different LS174T stable cell lines (1  106 cells) suspended
in 300 mL of serum-free DMEM supplemented with insulin–
transferrin–selenium (Life Technologies) were injected subcutaneously into the back of 8-week-old male athymic mice (Harlan).
All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee at the University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis
(Nice, France; CIEPAL-azur agreement NCE/165; see Supplementary Data for details).
Proliferation assay
The different LS174T cell lines (6  104 cells) were seeded onto
6-well plates, three wells per cell line and per condition. We
measured proliferation by detaching the cells by trypsinization,
and counting them daily with a Coulter Z1 (Beckman) during 5
days. Proliferation units were calculated by dividing the cell
number obtained for each day by the one obtained 24 hours
after seeding.
Metabolic analysis
The rate of extracellular acidiﬁcation (ECAR) and the oxygen
consumption rate (OCR) were measured using the Seahorse XF24
analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). LS174T cells (9  104) and U87
cells (3  105) were seeded on Seahorse 24-well plates, 24 and 3
hours, respectively, before analysis. Cells were maintained in cell
culture medium without glucose, pyruvate, serum, or bicarbonate, and incubated for 45 minutes in a non-CO2 incubator at
37 C. The wells were mixed for 2 minutes and the pH and oxygen

Results
Disruption of BSG/MCTs complex ablates lactic acid transport
and decreases intracellular pH
We ﬁrst knocked out the MCT4 gene in LS174T cells that express
high levels of BSG, MCT1, and MCT4; the mutations altering the
two alleles are depicted in Supplementary Fig. S1A. We then
knocked out the BSG gene in wild-type (WT) LS174T (Supplementary Fig. S1B) or in LS174T-MCT4/ generating the double
knocked out BSG/, MCT4/ cell line. The MCT4/ cell line
shows the lack of expression of MCT4 in both normoxia and
hypoxia (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Ablation of MCT4 was accompanied by a slight decrease in the expression of BSG in normoxia
and hypoxia (Fig. 1A), and by an increase in MCT1 expression that
is more apparent in hypoxia (Fig. 1A). BSG knockout lead to the
complete loss of both forms, the heavily glycosylated (around
65 kDa) and the immature low-molecular weight form of 39 kDa.
BSG disruption, as expected from its chaperone role, induces
decreased expression of both transporters MCT1 and MCT4
(Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained for the human glioblastoma cell line. Knockout of the BSG gene in U87 cells induced a
major decrease in the protein level of MCT1 and MCT4 in both
normoxia and hypoxia (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
Next, we investigated the impact of these mutations on the Vmax
values of MCT1 and MCT4 by measuring initial lactic acid
transport rates. The initial entry rates of total lactic acid transport
in hypoxic LS174T cells was 61  5% for MCT1 and 39  5% for
MCT4. Quantiﬁcation was facilitated by the use of the speciﬁc
MCT1 inhibitor (AR-C155858) referred to as MCT1i and the
observation that LS174T cells do not express MCT2 and MCT3
(data not shown). Disruption of the MCT4 gene did not modify
the transport activity of MCT1 (Fig. 1B). However, addition of 300
nmol/L MCT1i to the MCT4/ cell line totally abolished facilitated lactic acid transport, conﬁrming the nonexpression of other
MCT isoforms (Fig. 1B). Disruption of BSG severely reduced the
lactic acid transport activity. Thus, MCT1 and MCT4 expression
was reduced by 10- and 6-fold, respectively, in LS174T (Fig. 1B),
and by 3.9- and 3.3-fold, respectively, in U87 (Supplementary
Fig. S2B), conﬁrming that in the absence of BSG, MCTs, fully
transcribed (Supplementary Fig. S3), were retained and degraded
in the endoplasmic reticulum as nonfunctional transporters (25).
The next step was to analyze the pHi in the LS174-mutant
derivatives. The alkaline resting pHi of the parental LS174 cell
line, close to 8, was essentially not affected by the complete
inhibition of MCT1 (Fig. 1C). The additional knockout of MCT4

had a very modest effect on pHi. In sharp contrast, in the MCT4/
cells, MCT1i increased by 10-fold the intracellular Hþ concentration; the resting pHi decreased from about 7.9 to 6.9 (Fig. 1C).
Inactivation of the BSG/MCTs complexes decreases the rate of
glycolysis and reactivates OXPHOS
When mutants derived from LS174T cells were starved for 1
hour of glucose, they rapidly accumulated intracellular lactic acid

www.aacrjournals.org

upon glucose addition with a steady-state equilibrium that was
reached within 3 to 5 hours (Fig. 2A). In agreement with the results
described above, BSG/ and BSG/, MCT4/ cells, compared
with parental cells, accumulated a large intracellular pool of lactic
acid ranging from 5 to 6 mmol/L lactate in parental cells to 20
mmol/L in the double knockout BSG/, MCT4/ cells (Fig. 2A,
left) . The intracellular pool of lactic acid of the single mutant
MCT4/ was not affected (7 mmol/L), indicating the major role
played by MCT1 alone in lactic acid export. As expected, treatment
of the cells with MCT1i further increased the intracellular lactate
levels particularly for the MCT4/ cells reaching 38 to 40 mmol/L
(Fig. 2A, right). This accumulation was less pronounced in the
BSG/ cells, whereas parental cells remained less sensitive to
MCT1 inhibition. With such a block in lactic acid export, retroinhibition on lactic dehydrogenease-A (LDHA) was expected to
lead to a parallel increase in pyruvic acid pool. Pyruvate concentrations were about 20-fold lower than lactate pool in parental
cells but increased 4- to 6-fold in the three MCT/BSG knockout
cells (Fig. 2B, right).
The intracellular glycolytic metabolite and proton accumulation mediated by MCT blockade had, not surprisingly, a strong
negative impact on the rate of glycolysis. Data from the Seahorse
analyzer conﬁrmed the rapid decrease in the ECAR after BSG/
knockout (2-fold) or BSG/,MCT4/ double knockout (3fold), whereas the ECAR was similar in MCT4/ and parental
cells (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, MCT1 inhibition did not affect the
ECAR of parental cells, a result that was consistent with the
relatively high expression of MCT4 in normoxic LS174T cells
(Fig. 1A). However, compared with parental cells, MCT1i virtually
suppressed the ECAR in the MCT4/ cells (8 and 16-fold
decreases of ECAR in mct4/ and BSG/,MCT4/ cells,
respectively; Fig. 2C).
The corresponding OCR, which was low in parental cells, in
contrast increased progressively with mutations affecting the
intensity of the glycolytic blockade (WT < MCT4/ < BSG/ <
BSG/,MCT4/; Fig. 2D). As expected, the OCR was increased in
the disrupted cell lines upon MCT1 inhibitor. These results were
conﬁrmed in U87 cells. Indeed, both U87 BSG-null cells displayed
a decreased ECAR (50%) and even an increased OCR (53%)
compared with the parental U87 cells. These changes were magniﬁed by the pharmacologic inhibition of MCT1 (Supplementary
Fig. S2C and S2D).
Taken together, these ﬁndings highlight the plasticity of cancer
cells and clearly demonstrate the ability of highly glycolytic tumor
cells, such as LS174T and U87 cells, to rapidly shift their metabolism to OXPHOS, a mechanism of resistance to inhibition of
fermentative glycolysis.
To further understand how this metabolic switch occurred and
to which substrate the knockout cells relied on to increase their
respiration, we ﬁrst assessed the impact of glutamine deprivation on the OCR. Indeed, glutamine metabolism is well documented as a carbon and bioenergetic source for cancer cells (30).
Our results showed that the highly glycolytic parental LS174T
cells displayed, in the presence of 2 mmol/L glutamine as the only
exogenous carbon source (no glucose), a rather low respiratory
rate (OCR ¼ 180) that was increased when the MCT activity
was partially disrupted (OCR ¼ 380 in MCT4/ and 600 in
BSG/; Fig. 2E). Removal of glutamine from this medium
sharply reduced by 3- to 4-fold the rate of respiration for the
three cell lines thereby highlighting the key contribution of
glutamine to respiration (Fig. 2E and Supplementary Fig. S4A

and S4B). We next conducted the experiment without glutamine
to analyze the contribution of glucose in OXPHOS (Fig. 2F). The
rate of respiration increased in proportion to the decreased level of
the MCT activity (WT < MCT4/ < BSG/) and became maximal
in the presence of MCT1i (Fig. 2F). It is interesting to note that in
the presence of MCT1i, both MCT4/ or BSG/ cells respired at
the same level, that is, 4-fold above the parental cells (Fig. 2F), a
value that paralleled the increased intracellular pool of pyruvate
in these two cell lines (5-fold increase in the ﬁrst hour of MCT1i
addition; Fig. 2B, right). Because this increase in OXPHOS is
sensitive to rotenone (Fig. 2F) or metformin/phenformin (Supplementary Fig. S5B), mitochondrial complex I inhibitors (31–
33), we propose that the accumulation of pyruvate increases, by
mass action, the activity of PDH.

Disruption of the BSG/MCTs complexes arrests cell growth and
sensitizes cells to phenformin
We next reported the impact of inhibition of glycolysis on the in
vitro growth rates of the four LS174T-derived cell lines (Fig. 3A and
B) and of the three U87-derived cell lines (Supplementary
Fig. S2E). In normoxia, the disruption of MCT4, BSG, or both
had only a modest effect on the growth rate (less than 20%, for
BSG/; Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S2E, left). In hypoxia, the
trend in general is that many tumor cells display a reduced growth
rate (2-fold reduction for the parental LS174T cells). Again, it is
the BSG/,MCT4/ cells that display the most reduced growth
rate in hypoxia compared with the parental cells (1.5-fold, Fig. 3A,
right). In contrast with these modest effects on growth, the
addition of the MCT1i, that does not affect the parental cell

growth, decreased the growth of U87 BSG/ cells by 2-fold
(Supplementary Fig. S2E), and severely reduced the growth of
LS174T -MCT4/ cells by, respectively, 3-fold (Fig. 3A, left) and
up to 6-fold in hypoxia (Fig. 3A, right).
Interestingly, this decrease in growth rate correlated with the
decrease in pHi (Fig. 1C), which is known to restrict mTORC1
(34) as seen by inhibition of p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation (Fig.
3B). In other words, the MCT1i sensitized MCT4-null cells to
growth arrest by inducing a pHi drop of 1 pH unit. The most
remarkable ﬁnding is that ablation of lactic acid export induced
only cytostasis with minimal loss of cell viability (data not
shown). The bioenergetic plasticity reported above is certainly
the basis of this acquired tumor cell viability under MCT
blockade. We thus analyzed the in vitro growth of LS174T cells

(WT or BSG/) treated with MCT1i or the lipophilic biguanide
metformin analog, phenformin, or both. Figure 3C shows that the
parental cells, either grown in normoxia or hypoxia, are not
affected by any of the treatments, MCT1i, phenformin, or both.
Disruption of BSG alone, however, severely restricted clonal
growth in response to phenformin in normoxia but not in
hypoxia (Fig. 3C). In hypoxia, although MCT1i or phenformin
alone has no effect, their combination suppressed clonal growth,
highlighting a clear case of synthetic lethality (Fig. 3C). Similar
results were obtained by replacing 50 mmol/L phenformin by 1
mmol/L of the hydrophilic and less permeable analog metformin.
The diverse growth phenotypes displayed in normoxia/
hypoxia and in response to phenformin by the four cell lines,
WT, MCT4/, BSG/, and BSG/,MCT4/, are easily

explained by their energy metabolic features. In normoxia, the
rates of glycolysis (ECAR), although high are further stimulated in
response to phenformin for the WT and MCT4/ cell lines but
not affected in the most MCT-disrupted cells BSG/ and BSG/,
MCT4/ (Supplementary Fig. S5A). The corresponding OCR
showed a collapse of respiration for the four cell lines in response
to phenformin (Supplementary Fig. S5B). The most dramatic
phenformin-mediated growth restriction is only seen in the most
restricted cell lines for MCT/glycolysis: BSG/ and BSG/,
MCT4/ (Supplementary Fig. S5C).
These ﬁndings received conﬁrmation in two independent BSGnull tumor cell lines, glioblastoma U87 (Supplementary Fig. S2E)
and lung adenoma carcinoma A549 (data not shown), pointing
that targeting glycolysis (MCT inhibition) sensitized cells to
phenformin. In hypoxic conditions, however, MCT4 induction
induced a slight resistance to phenformin for BSG/ cells, whereas cells lacking both BSG and MCT4 remained highly sensitive
(Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S5C). For BSG/ and BSG/,
MCT4/ cells, we postulate that the elevated intracellular lactate
levels played a negative feedback on the glycolysis, thus inhibiting
the increased ECAR due to phenformin (Supplementary Fig. S5A
and S5B). These ﬁndings were supported by other results obtained

from the Ras-transformed ﬁbroblast CCL39 cell line, for which we
possess mutants impaired either in glycolysis (gly; Supplementary Fig. S5D; refs. 29, 35) or in respiration (res; Supplementary
Fig. S5E; refs. 21, 28). As expected, only the CCL39 glycolysis–
defective cells (gly) were rapidly killed by phenformin treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S5F).
In conclusion, phenformin/metformin severely impairs growth
and viability of tumor cells only when fermentative glycolysis is
compromised.
Phenformin combined with BSG/MCTs disruption induces a
major drop in cellular ATP provoking rapid cell death
As mentioned above, phenformin treatment abolishes
OXPHOS (Supplementary Fig. S5B). This resulted in decreased
mitochondrial ATP and led to a compensatory increase in glycolysis with increased lactate production and extracellular acidiﬁcation (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Here, we showed that 24
hours of phenformin treatment had no effect on intracellular
ATP levels of LS174T WT cells in both normoxia and hypoxia (Fig.
4A and B). In the case of MCT4 knockout, phenformin only
decreased the intracellular ATP by 10% showing that the compensatory glycolysis is sufﬁcient to maintain high ATP levels.

Genetic Disruption of the Lactate/Hþ Symporters in Cancer

However, BSG/ and BSG/,MCT4/ cells, impaired in their
glycolytic ﬂux, were not able to restore their intracellular ATP,
which dropped by 60% and 80%, respectively, compared with WT
cells in normoxia (Fig. 4A). MCT4 induction in hypoxia limited
this decrease for BSG/ cells, conﬁrming thus our ﬁndings on
clonal growth.
Although MCT1 inhibition slightly decreased the intracellular
ATP of BSG/MCT-disrupted cells, combination with phenformin
induced an "energetic crisis" represented by a striking decrease of
ATP (up to 85%; Fig. 4A and B). This ATP drop resulted in
enhanced cytotoxicity and consequently rapid cell death. Indeed,
50% of either MCT4/ or BSG/ cells, and 90% of BSG/,
MCT4/ cells died in both normoxia and hypoxia after 24 hours
of combined treatment; and only 8% of BSG/ cells survived
under hypoxic conditions after 96 hours (Fig. 4C and D). These

results pointed out the acute synthetic lethality achieved through
the simultaneous block of lactic acid export and mitochondrial
complex I.
Lactate export inhibition combined to phenformin suppresses
xenograft tumor cell growth
To assess the efﬁcacy of our combined strategy in vivo, LS174Tderived cell lines were injected subcutaneously to nude mice. After
tumor appearance (>30 mm3), mice received 200 mg/kg/d phenformin in the drinking water, and/or, when speciﬁed, 100 mg/kg
MCT1 inhibitor AZD3965 twice daily by oral gavage for 10 days.
Interestingly, even if no relevant differences were seen in vitro,
knockout of either MCT4, BSG, or both induced in untreated mice
a modest (20%–25%) decrease in tumor growth (Fig. 5A–D).

treatment alone had no effect (Fig. 5A and B), suggesting, as
shown in Fig. 3C, an in vivo hypoxic environment. In contrast and
consistent with in vitro clonal growth (Supplementary Fig. S5C),
phenformin alone reduced by 2-fold tumor growth of MCT4/
and BSG/,MCT4/ tumors (Fig. 5C and D). Treatment with
MCT1i alone affected tumor growth of the four tumor cell lines.
The reduction in the tumor growth rate of WT and BSG/ tumors
(2-fold) was stopped with halt in treatment (arrows, Fig. 5A
and B). As expected, the strongest inhibitory effect of MCT1i
alone was observed in the two MCT4-null cell lines: 75% and
86% reduction in tumor volume, respectively, for MCT4/ and
BSG/,MCT4/ tumors (Fig. 5C and D). Finally, combination
of treatment (phenformin/MCT1i) reduced further the tumor
volume to 84% and 96% when measured at 20 days in the two
MCT4-null cell lines (Fig. 5C and D).
Taken together, these ﬁndings support the importance of combining blockers of lactate/Hþ transporters (MCT1 and MCT4)
with inhibitors of OXPHOS (phenformin) for a novel efﬁcient
anticancer strategy.

Discussion
In this study, we extended our previous work on the last step
of glycolysis and further investigated via gene disruption the key
role of MCTs/BSG complexes in controlling lactic acid export,
bioenergetics, and tumor growth.
Ablation of MCTs induced inhibition of growth but not cell
death
We showed that the growth of the two glycolytic cell lines,
LS174 and U87, was not impaired by pharmacologic inhibition of
MCT1 (MCT1i). The basal and hypoxia-induced expression of
MCT4 was sufﬁcient to ensure export of lactic acid and growth.
Thus, it was clear from previous MCT knockdown studies that
both MCT1/4 have to be suppressed for anticancer strategies,
unless only MCT1 is expressed like in transformed ﬁbroblasts (21)
or neoplastic B cells (22). Interestingly BSG-knockout, as expected
from Halestrap's work (26), severely reduced the MCT1/4 lactate
transport activities but only minimally affected in vitro and in vivo
growth of both cell lines. It is only when the full MCT activity was
ablated, in MCT4-null cells treated with MCT1i that in vitro and in
vivo growth was strongly reduced but not abolished (Figs. 3A
and Fig. 5C). This strong inhibitory growth effect of MCT1i (300
nmol/L) raises the question of its speciﬁcity that we addressed
previously with cells expressing only MCT1 or both MCT1/4 (21).
We conﬁrmed the speciﬁcity of MCT1i by showing that the
residual growth rate seen in MCT1/MCT4 double knockout is
not affected by MCT1i (data not shown). This tumor growth
inhibition, however, is not due to cell death but due to cytostasis
induced by mTORC1 inhibition in response to intracellular acidic
stress (Fig. 3B), as we previously reported (34).
Inhibition of MCTs maintains cell survival by reactivating
OXPHOS
BSG-disruption in LS174T and U87 cells impacted strongly on
the plasma membrane expression of MCT1/4 thereby reducing
lactate transport and inducing a 2-fold reduction in the rate of
glycolysis and almost no change in the rate of growth. This
minimal impact on growth was surprising until we realized
reactivation of OXPHOS in BSG-null cells. Thus, treating BSGor MCT4-null cells with MCT1i reduced further lactate export,

178 Cancer Res; 75(1) January 1, 2015

leading to substantial intracellular accumulation of lactate, pyruvate, and Hþ. This drastic metabolic and acidic stress inhibited
further the glycolytic rate thereby mirroring a sharp increase in
oxygen consumption. This metabolic plasticity, observed within
minutes of addition of MCT1i, explains the cell survival by rapid
maintenance of ATP levels. These ﬁndings contrasted with similar
approaches that targeted MCT1 (22), MCT4 (36), or the upstream
glycolytic step of LDHA (18, 20). In these three cases, cell death
was reported to be associated with a decrease in ATP and an
increase in oxidative stress. This was not the case for all the MCTdisrupted cell lines issued from LS174 even when associated with
MCT1i treatment; ATP levels decreased no more than 20% and no
reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S6A), a result apparently consistent with the
antioxidant character of lactate (37). Nevertheless, this is an
important issue that needs further exploration to fully understand
resistance or vulnerability depending of the cancer model used.
How can we turn the cytostatic effect imposed by MCTs
blockade into cell death? As ATP levels, rescued from OXPHOS,
were due to activation of mitochondrial complex I (Fig. 2F and
Supplementary Fig. S5B), the solution to the question came from
associating phenformin with MCTs inhibition. The most remarkable point here is that only a 2-fold reduction in the glycolytic rate
of BSG-null cells sensitized normoxic cells to death in response to
phenformin or metformin. Note that these two biguanides, at
their respective active concentrations (50 mmol/L, 1 mmol/L), had
no detectable effect on growth and viability of WT cells (Fig. 3C,
data not shown). Phenformin, alone or combined with MCT1i,
reduced the ATP pool of BSG-null cells, respectively, by 60% and
80% in 24 hours. Loss of cell viability in either normoxia or
hypoxia paralleled the rapid fall in ATP with no detectable
apoptosis; this was acute necrotic cell death resulting from ATP
crisis. Indeed combining phenformin with MCTs blockade
induced ROS formation (Supplementary Fig. S6B), as reported
by Cleveland's group (22), but cell death was not avoided by
addition of N-acetyl-L-cysteine conﬁrming cell death by "metabolic catastrophe."
Tumor lactate, a double-edged sword speaks for a MCT
targeting strategy
Lactic acid generated from tumors is emerging as a major
metabolite that impacts on the tumor microenvironment not
only as a signaling molecule, but also as an acid stressor
compromising immune surveillance (14, 38, 39). High levels
of tumor lactate in cervical cancers (40) as well as high expression of MCT4, a major lactate transporter in breast cancers (17),
are reported to be associated with a high frequency of metastases, tumor recurrence, and low survival. High lactate levels
also signal "pseudo hypoxia" by increasing HIF1a stability
(41), which promotes or enhances tumor hypoxia. We conﬁrmed that four hypoxic markers, CA9, LDHA, PDK1 and
VEGF-A, were further induced 3- to 8-fold in hypoxia by the
increased pool of 40 mmol/L lactate (Supplementary Fig. S3E).
Lactate as a signaling metabolite was also reported to promote
M2 polarization of tumor-inﬁltrated macrophages (42). The
second edged sword of lactate is its acidic function that together
with carbonic acid (43) contributes to the extracellular acidic
tumor microenvironment (14). Few reports have demonstrated
the devastating impact of lactic acid on several immune cell
function in vitro (44) and inhibition of cytolytic NK in vivo (45).
Interestingly, the anergic state established at low pH (6–6.5) of

Genetic Disruption of the Lactate/Hþ Symporters in Cancer

tumor-speciﬁc CD8(þ) T lymphocytes could be reverted by
restoring a physiologic pH (39).
Altogether, these protumoral features of lactate levels and acidic
tumor microenvironment converge to raise optimism concerning
an anticancer strategy that will reduce production and secretion of
lactic acid. Here, we provided genetic evidence that targeting
MCT1 and MCT4 reduced tumor growth and, if associated with
the antidiabetic drugs phenformin/metformin (33), could, in a
short tolerable therapeutic window, induce tumor cell death. Our
optimism took off from our in vitro preliminary experiments on
several cancer cell lines combining MCT1i and the novel speciﬁc
MCT4 inhibitor in current development by AstraZeneca (46).
Further experimentation with immune-competent mouse genetic
cancer models and the MCT1/MCT4 inhibitors should demonstrate the beneﬁt of this novel anticancer strategy.
