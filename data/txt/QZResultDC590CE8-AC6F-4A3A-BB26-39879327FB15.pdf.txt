BACKGROUND: Several studies have suggested that bisphosphonates have an antitumor effect. In the current study,
the authors sought to evaluate whether the use of bisphosphonates increased the rate of pathological complete
response (pCR) in patients with breast cancer. METHODS: The authors identified 1449 patients with breast cancer
who were receiving taxane- and anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy between 1995 and 2007 at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Patients who received bisphosphonates for osteopenia or osteoporosis
while receiving chemotherapy were also identified. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients achieving a
pCR. Groups were compared using the chi-square test. A multivariable logistic regression model was fit to examine
the relation between the use of bisphosphonates and pCR. An exploratory survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier
method was performed; groups were compared using the log-rank test. RESULTS: Of the 1449 patients included, 39
(2.7%) received bisphosphonates. Those receiving bisphosphonates were older (P < .001) and less likely to be obese
(P ¼ .04). The pCR rate was 25.4% in the bisphosphonate group and 16% in the nonbisphosphonate group (P ¼ .11). In
the multivariable model, patients treated with bisphosphonates tended to have higher rates of pCR (odds ratio, 2.18;
95% confidence interval, 0.90-5.24); however, the difference was not found to be statistically significant. With a median follow-up of 55 months (range, 3 months-145 months), no differences in disease recurrence or survival were
observed. CONCLUSIONS: The use of bisphosphonates at the time of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not found to
be associated with a statistically significant increase in the rates of pCR. The observed estimates suggest a positive
effect; however, the small percentage of patients receiving bisphosphonates likely affected the power to detect a

Breast cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death among women in the United States. It is estimated that

during 2009, > 194,280 new cases were diagnosed and 40,610 deaths occurred.1 Despite significant advances in the treatment
of patients with breast cancer, approximately 10% to 60% of patients with initial localized breast cancer will develop systemic
disease recurrence. Neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) is the standard approach to treat women with locally advanced and
inflammatory breast cancer, and is now being used in patients with earlier stage disease. By downstaging tumors; NST most
likely improves available surgical options while concurrently allowing for in vivo assessment of chemosensitivity. Furthermore,
attaining a pathological complete response (pCR) after NST has been shown by several investigators to be a surrogate marker
for improved long-term outcome, possibly because of the eradication of distant micrometastatic residual disease.2-8 Unfortunately, NST using conventional anthracycline- and/or taxane-based regimens results in pCR rates of only 8% to 31%.4,6,9,10
Bisphosphonates are analogs of pyrophosphates that bind to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibit bone resorption by
osteoclasts. They are widely used for the treatment of osteoporosis and to prevent both skeletal complications in patients

with bone metastases and the bone loss associated with
cancer treatment.11,12 There are clinical and preclinical
data suggesting that bisphosphonates have osteoclast-independent effects that can be associated with an antitumor
effect.13 Proposed mechanisms include the induction of
apoptosis; a synergistic effect with chemotherapy; or the
inhibition of tumor cells by affecting adhesion, migration,
invasion, and cell proliferation.14-16 Recent epidemiological studies have shown that the use of bisphosphonates
decreases the incidence of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women.17,18
The purpose of the current study was to determine
whether the use of bisphosphonates increased the rates of
pCR in a cohort of patients with breast cancer who were
treated with taxane- and anthracycline-based neoadjuvant
chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
Patients treated with NST were identified in a prospectively
maintained database in the Breast Medical Oncology
department at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. A total of 1449 patients diagnosed with invasive
primary breast cancer between 1995 and 2007 and treated
with anthracycline- and taxane-based NST were included.
We excluded patients with metastatic disease at the time of
diagnosis, those with bilateral breast cancer, or males. The
variables recorded included patient demographics (race, age,
and menopausal status), tumor characteristics (histology;
grade; lymphovascular invasion [LVI]; and estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 [HER2] status), clinical stage at diagnosis
(based on the criteria proposed by the sixth edition of American Joint Committee on Cancer criteria19), body mass index
(BMI), pathological stage, and recurrence and survival information. Patients who received bisphosphonates for another
indication (osteopenia and osteoporosis) while receiving
NST were identified by chart review (physician’s notes, medication records, and pharmacy records).
All pathology specimens were reviewed by dedicated
breast pathologists at the study institution. Histologic type
and grade were defined according to the World Health Organization classification system20 and the modified nuclear
grade system of Black and Speer,21 respectively. All surgical
breast and axillary lymph node specimens were reviewed to
identify the presence or absence of residual disease. pCR
was defined as no residual invasive cancer in both the breast
and the axillary lymph nodes.

Treatment
All patients were treated with a multidisciplinary
approach and received NST with an anthracycline- and
taxane-based regimen. Taxanes administered included
paclitaxel at a dose of 175 to 250 mg/m2 intravenously
(iv) on day 1 every 21 days for 4 cycles; paclitaxel at a dose
of 80 mg/m2 weekly for 12 doses; or docetaxel at a dose of
100 mg/m2 iv on day 1 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Anthracycline regimens included 3 to 6 cycles of 1 of the following: 5-fluorouracil at a dose of 500 mg/m2, epirubicin at a
dose of 100 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide at a dose of
500 mg/m2 iv on day 1, every 3 weeks; 5-fluorouracil at a
dose of 500 mg/m2 on days 1 and 4, epirubicin at a dose
of 75 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide at a dose of 500 mg/
m2 iv on day 1, every 3 weeks; 5-fluorouracil at a dose of
500 mg/m2 iv on days 1 and 4, doxorubicin at a dose of
50 mg/m2 iv by continuous infusion over 72 hours, and
cyclophosphamide at a dose of 500 mg/m2 on day 1 every
3 weeks; or doxorubicin at a dose of 60 mg/m2 and
cyclophosphamide at a dose of 600 mg/m2 iv on day 1,
every 3 weeks. There were a total of 258 patients with
tumors that overexpressed HER2-neu; none of these
patients received trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting.
At the completion of NST, all patients underwent
definitive surgery; eligibility for breast conservation was
determined based on recommendations made by the
multidisciplinary team and patient preferences. All
patients underwent axillary lymph node staging with axillary lymph node dissection or sentinel lymph node
biopsy. Radiation therapy was delivered if patients underwent breast conservation surgery or had locally advanced
disease, a primary tumor measuring > 5 cm, or  4
involved lymph nodes. Adjuvant hormonal therapy was
administered according to standard practice. The Institutional Review Board of The University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center approved the study.
Statistical Analysis and Outcome Measures
We computed descriptive statistics. Patient characteristics
were compared based on whether patients received
bisphosphonates, and groups were compared using the
chi-square test. Rates of pCR were compared among
groups. An exploratory analysis was performed to compare the pCR rates by bisphosphonate status according to
tumor subtype. A multivariable logistic regression model
was fit to examine the relation between the use of
bisphosphonates and pCR. Variables in the model
included age, stage of disease, tumor grade, tumor subtype, LVI, and BMI. Exploratory survival analyses were

performed to examine the recurrence-free survival (RFS)
and overall survival (OS) between groups. RFS was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of first documented local or distant recurrence or last follow-up.
Patients who died before experiencing a disease recurrence
were considered censored at their date of death. OS was
calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of death
or last follow-up. The Kaplan-Meier product limit
method was used to estimate the survival outcomes and
groups were compared with the log-rank statistic. P values
< .05 were considered to be statistically significant. All
tests were 2-sided. Statistical analyses were performed using
SAS (version 9.1; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and S-Plus 7.0
(Insightful Corporation, Seattle, Wash) statistical software.

RESULTS
A total of 1449 patients were included, of whom only 39
(2.7%) received bisphosphonates concurrently with NST.
Among the patients who received bisphosphonates,
66.7% (n ¼ 26), 28.2% (n ¼ 11), and 5.1% (n ¼ 2)
received alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate,
respectively. Patients who received bisphosphonates were
more likely to be older and postmenopausal (P < .001 for
both) and were less likely to be overweight (P ¼ .04).
Patient and tumor characteristics stratified by bisphosphonate use are summarized in Table 1.
Among the patients not treated with bisphosphonates, 16.0% achieved a pCR. A higher rate of pCR
(25.6%) was observed among those patients treated with

bisphosphonates; however, this difference did not
achieve statistical significance (P ¼ .11). When the rates
of pCR in the bisphosphonate and nonbisphosphonate
groups were compared according to tumor subtype, the
same trend was observed, but in all cases the results were
not statistically significant. In the patients with hormone-positive tumors, the pCR rates between the
bisphosphonate and nonbisphosphonate groups were
7.6% versus 16.7% (P ¼ .10); in those patients with
tumors overexpressing HER2-neu, the rates were 26.8%
versus 37.5% (P ¼ .50); and among patients with triple
receptor-negative tumors, the rates were 26.9% versus
42.9% (P ¼ .35). The results of the multivariable model

for pCR are shown in Table 2. After adjusting for age,
stage, tumor subtype, grade, LVI, and BMI, bisphosphonate use was found to be associated with higher pCR
rates (odds ratio [OR], 2.16; 95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 0.90-5.24 [P ¼ .08]); however, statistical significance was not reached.
The median follow-up was 55 months (range, 3
months–155 months). Among all patients, there were 413
recurrences. The RFS rate at 5 years was 71.0% (95%CI,
68.0%-73.0%) among patients who did not receive
bisphosphonates and 81% (95%CI, 64%-90%) among
those who did (P ¼ .28). There were a total of 359 deaths.
The OS rate at 5 years was 77.0% (95%CI, 74.0%-79.0%)
among those patients who did not receive bisphosphonates
compared with 83% (95%CI, 65.0%-92.0%) for those
who did (P ¼ .42). The RFS and OS estimates by
bisphosphonate group according to tumor subtype are
shown in Table 3. Kaplan-Meier curves for RFS and OS
by bisphosphonate group are presented in Figure 1.

DISCUSSION
The objective of the current study was to describe the
effect of bisphosphonate use on the pCR rates among
patients with breast cancer who are treated with anthracycline- and taxane-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In
this retrospective, single-institution study, the results
demonstrated that pCR rates were higher among patients
who received bisphosphonates; however, the difference

was not statistically significant. Similarly, in a multivariable model, patients who received oral bisphosphonates
during NST tended to have higher rates of pCR; however,
this association only approached statistical significance.
We did not find an association between bisphosphonate
use and RFS or OS.

Despite being inconclusive, these results of the current study could suggest that bisphosphonates may have
tumor effects outside the bone, maybe even enhancing the
effect of chemotherapy. We observed that 16% of the
patients in the current study who did not receive
bisphosphonates achieved a pCR compared with 25.6%
of the patients who did. These results are in concordance
with previously reported data. The AZURE (Adjuvant
Zoledronic Acid to Reduce Recurrence) trial evaluated
whether zoledronic acid (ZA) when added to systemic
chemotherapy improved disease-related outcomes. In a
subset analysis evaluating 195 patients who received
NST,22 the mean residual tumor size was smaller in the
ZA group compared with the non-ZA group (P ¼ .024).
The rates of pCR favored the group treated with ZA
(6.9% vs 11.7%) and in the multivariable analysis, the use
of ZA increased the odds of achieving a pCR (OR, 2.1;
95%CI, 0.8-6.3).22 The estimate did not achieve statistical significance, and the authors attributed it to the small
number of patients achieving a pCR. In a phase 2 clinical
trial (n ¼ 120), Aft et al evaluated the addition of ZA to
anthracycline- and taxane-based NST.23 In an exploratory
analysis evaluating tumor responses at the time of surgery,
a pCR rate of 15.5% was observed in the patients who did
not receive ZA compared with 21.6% in the patients who
did (P ¼ .63). In addition, in a tumor subtype analysis,
they observed an effect among patients with triple-negative tumors, with a pCR rate of 10.5% in the non-ZA
group compared with 28.6% in the ZA acid group. More
recently, the ANZAC trial randomized 40 patients to
receive chemotherapy with or without ZA. The biomarker
analysis indicated a greater reduction in VEGF and in cell
turnover at day 5 in the ZA arm; however, this marker
recovered by day 21, suggesting that ZA may have relevant
biologic effects that require further exploration.24
Despite being insignificant, the results of the current
and some of the previously discussed studies suggest that
bisphosphonates may have an antitumor effect when used
in combination with NST. However, the small numbers
mandate a cautious interpretation of the data. Bisphosphonates, and in particular ZA, have been demonstrated to
have a synergistic antitumor effect in preclinical models
when used in combination with doxorubicin,14,15 and all
the patients included in the previously discussed studies
were treated with anthracyclines. The possible antitumor
effect of bisphosphonates is also supported by epidemiological studies suggesting that the use of bisphosphonates
is associated with a reduced risk of developing breast cancer. Data from the Women’s Health Initiative evaluated

the association between the use of bisphosphonates and
the development of invasive breast cancer. In a large
cohort of 154,768 postmenopausal women, a statistically
significant association between the use of oral bisphosphonates and a lower incidence of invasive breast cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% CI, 0.52-0.88) was observed.17
Similarly, Rennert et al18 reported that the use of
bisphosphonates for > 1 year was associated with a 28%
reduction in the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer.
The potential antitumor effect of bisphosphonates
has been reported in the adjuvant setting, but the data are
still inconclusive. Diel et al25 randomized 302 patients to
receive clodronate for 2 years versus standard of care. After
36 months of follow-up, a reduction in the incidence of
bone and visceral metastases (P ¼ .003) and an increase in
OS (P ¼ .001) in the clodronate treatment arm were
observed. However, after an extended follow-up of 53
months, the effect of clodronate on visceral metastases was
no longer significant. A similar large multicenter study26
compared the use of clodronate against placebo in 1069
patients with breast cancer. After 2 years of treatment,
patients in the clodronate group had a reduction in the
incidence of bone metastases; however, the effect did not
reach statistical significance. In contrast, Saarto et al27 did
not observe any reduction in the incidence of bone metastases in those patients who were randomized to receive
clodronate. The patients treated with clodronate were
actually found to have a higher risk of nonskeletal recurrences (43% vs 25%; P ¼ .0007), leading to lower disease-free survival (DFS) in the treatment arm.
The Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study
Group (ABCSG)-12 study (n ¼ 1803), a phase 3, 2  2,
4-arm trial, randomized patients to receive goserelin acetate or tamoxifen with or without ZA.28 No difference
was observed among the tamoxifen and goserelin treatment arms, however; patients who received ZA experienced an improvement in RFS (HR, 0.64; 95%CI, 0.460.91), but no difference in OS was noted. A recently
published meta-analysis29 including data from 13 clinical
trials evaluated the use of bisphosphonates in the adjuvant
setting in 6886 patients with breast cancer. Treatment
with ZA was not found to be associated with any statistically significant difference in rates of death (OR, 0.642;
95%CI, 0.388-1.063) or bone metastasis (OR, 0.661;
95%CI, 0.379-1.151). The AZURE trial22 randomized
3360 patients with breast cancer to receive 5 years of ZA
or no treatment. With a median follow-up of 58.6
months, no differences with regard to rates of local or distant recurrence or DFS (HR, 0.98; 95%CI, 0.85-1.10) or

Cancer

January 15, 2012

OS (HR, 0.88; 95%CI, 0.72-1.01) were observed. However, in an analysis performed according to menopausal
status, an improvement in DFS and OS was observed
among patients with established menopause, suggesting
that ZA may have a benefit when administered in a lowestrogen environment.
To appreciate the findings of the current study,
some strengths and limitations need to be addressed. The
current study is retrospective in nature, and therefore is
associated with the limitations inherent to this type of
study design. All the patients were treated at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Despite the
different chemotherapy regimens used, patients were
treated in similar way regardless of whether they were
treated with bisphosphonates. Therefore, if differences in
treatment occurred, they were nondifferential. Information regarding bisphosphonate intake during NST was
obtained by chart review. However, despite a thorough
review of physician’s notes, medication records, and pharmacy records, it is possible that not all the patients receiving bisphosphonates were correctly identified, likely
diluting any possible association. The observed estimates
suggest that bisphosphonates may have a positive effect in
increasing the rates of pCR among patients with breast
cancer; however, the small percentage of patients receiving
bisphosphonates likely affected the power to detect a statistically significant difference. In addition, it is important
to mention that all the patients identified as bisphosphonate users received oral bisphosphonates. We cannot
exclude the possibility that the use of iv, more potent
bisphosphonates could have a significant effect on the
rates of pCR. In addition, we did not observe any differences in RFS or OS. It is important to mention that the
impact of adjuvant radiation, endocrine, and trastuzumab
therapy was not taken into account in the current analysis.
It is possible that any potential differences in survival were
diluted by differences in treatment in the adjuvant setting.
In conclusion, the results of the current study demonstrate that in this cohort of patients, bisphosphonate
use was not associated with pCR rates. Although all our
estimates suggest a positive effect, the small percentage of
patients receiving bisphosphonates likely affected the
power to detect a statistically significant difference. Given
the preclinical and clinical data suggesting bisphosphonate-induced antitumor effects, prospective studies evaluating the effect of potent bisphosphonates are needed.
Several questions regarding the use of bisphosphonates
remain unanswered; it is unclear what dose and frequency
will be appropriate and further studies should address this

issue. In addition, further epidemiological studies and
molecular characterization of the tumors are needed to
explore whether the antitumor effect of bisphosphonates
predominates in specific subsets of patients with breast
cancer.
