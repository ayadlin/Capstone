The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) describes the presence of extracapsular spread and/or positive margins in oropharynx cancer (OPC) as an indication for the addition of chemotherapy to postoperative radiation. The guideline’s category 1 consensus is based on what they term high-level evidence. For this study, the authors performed a critical appraisal of the research upon
which the NCCN guideline is based and assessed its relevance in the era of human papillomavirus (HPV)/p16-positive OPC. Multiple
shortcomings were identified, including patient exclusion after randomization and the use of unplanned subgroup analyses without
multivariate adjustment, which undermined internal validity. Indeterminate HPV/p16 status limited external validity. Given the unique
biology of HPV/p16-positive tumors and the problems of internal and external validity, the authors concluded that the literature upon
which the recommendation for the addition of chemotherapy to adjuvant radiation was based does not generate high-level evidence,
and its relevance for the postoperative management of patients with HPV/p16-positive OPC remains unknown. Cancer 2015;121:1747C 2015 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
The presence of extracapsular spread (ECS) and/or positive margins after surgical resection of oropharynx carcinoma
(OPC) are considered high-risk features, which generally trigger treatment with adjuvant chemoradiation (CRT). The recommendation to combine postoperative chemotherapy with adjuvant radiation (RT) to target these features constitutes a
clinical practice guideline by the National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN).1 The NCCN cites the evidence
and consensus for this guideline as category 1, ie, based on high-level evidence, the uniform NCCN consensus is that the
intervention is appropriate.
Head and neck cancer epidemiology has undergone a marked change over the last decade, with an upsurge of human
papillomavirus (HPV)-driven OPC in healthy, nonsmoking males.2 Several studies across the world have demonstrated
that prognosis and prognostic factors for surgically treated, HPV-driven OPC differ from those in traditional smokingdriven disease.3-7 The Institute of Medicine8 published best practice standards for developing trustworthy clinical practice
guidelines, which include establishing evidence foundations for recommendations, use of external review, management of
conflicts of interest, and regular guideline update. Hence, the existing postoperative adjuvant therapy-related NCCN
guidelines need re-evaluation and an imminent update, particularly in light of the biologically determined good prognosis
and rapidly increasing incidence of HPV-driven OPC. In this study, we conducted a critical appraisal of the scientific literature that provides the evidence upon which the NCCN guidelines are based for recommendation of adjuvant CRT in the
presence of ECS and/or positive margins in patients with OPC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A critical appraisal was performed of publications,9-11 that form the initial evidence base for the current NCCN guidelines
regarding postoperative adjuvant therapy in OPC. These guidelines result from 3 publications that were generated by 2

multicenter, randomized clinical trials: 1) Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trial 9501 from the United
States9; 2) European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) trial 2293110; and 3) a collaborative, comparative analysis of both trials.11 In addition, the
long-term RTOG 9501 trial report12 was reviewed. The
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)
2010 checklist13 was used to evaluate the trials. Additional
metrics, including the absolute risk reduction, the absolute
risk increase, the number needed to treat, and the number
needed to harm with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were
calculated to quantitatively assess the actual treatment benefit and harm from the addition of chemotherapy to postoperative RT.14 Heterogeneity between the treatment
groups was investigated using a chi-square test, and statistical significance was tested with a 2-tailed P value.
RESULTS
The salient features of the 4 publications from the 2
randomized clinical trials are summarized in Table 1. The
main problems identified in our critical appraisal are
detailed below along with other pertinent observations
(see Table 2).
Review of the Publications Cited as a Basis of
the NCCN Guideline
Failure to describe HPV/tumor protein 16 status

HPV/tumor protein 16 (p16) status was not assessed in either trial.9-11
Heterogeneous study population

Patients who had tumors with differing prognoses from
multiple subsites in the head and neck, such as the oral
cavity, oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx, were
grouped together. In the RTOG 95019 and EORTC
2293110 trials, 58% and 70% of patients, respectively,
had cancer that did not arise in the oropharynx.
In the RTOG 9501 trial, there was unequal distribution of patients with tumors from different head and neck
subsites in the 2 treatment arms.9 Compared with the RT
arm, patients in the CRT arm had a statistically significant
greater percentage of OPC (48% vs 37%; P 5 .029).
Patients in the CRT arm had statistically nonsignificant but
smaller percentages of cancers of the hypopharynx (7% vs
12%; P 5 .099) and oral cavity (24% vs 30%; P 5 .227).
Failure to report tumor and lymph node
classification

The distribution of tumor (T) and lymph node (N) classification across the CRT and RT treatment arms was not
reported in the RTOG 9501 trial9 or in the pooled
1748

study.11 Therefore, it is unclear whether the T and N classifications were distributed evenly across the CRT and RT
treatment arms.
Exclusion after randomization

After randomization and treatment, as reported in 2004
for the RTOG 9501 trial,9 43 of 459 patients (9%) were
excluded from the analysis after randomization and treatment; 22 patients were excluded from the CRT arm and
21 from the RT arm, after the study chairs conducted a
case-by-case, nonblinded review (Table 3). The causes for
exclusion were the absence of specified high-risk characteristics for eligibility (n 5 23), unclear site of tumor origin (n 5 10), macroscopically incomplete resection of
disease (n 5 7), metastatic disease at study entry (n 5 2),
and inadequate creatinine clearance (n 5 1).9 For the trial’s long-term results published in 2012,12 6 more patients
were excluded for a total of 11% (n 5 49 of 459 patients).
These 6 patients were identified as ineligible after a review
of additional submitted information, as mentioned in the
report12; however, the exact causes for their exclusion
were not specified.
Inconsistencies in numerical data

The number at risk for death at the 2-year follow-up
point in the RTOG 9501 study from 20049 was reported
as 252 patients (120 in the RT arm and 132 in the CRT
arm). However, from 2012,12 the number at risk at 2
years was reported as 203 patients (93 in the RT arm and
110 in the CRT arm), resulting in a difference of 19% (n
5 49 of 252 patients). In addition, the percentage of
patients who had the positive margin high-risk feature
was 18% for the study population in the original 2004
RTOG 9501 trial,9 but it was reported as 10% by the
collaborative study.11
Failure to report absolute effect sizes

The authors failed to report the treatment effects as absolute differences for the subgroup analyses. Table 4 provides the relative and absolute effect sizes with associated
95% CIs using the data reported in the publications.
Use of unplanned subgroup analyses in treatment
recommendation for ECS and/or positive margins

The collaborative, unplanned, high-risk subgroup analyses
form the basis of the treatment recommendation for
patients with ECS and/or positive margins.11 The trial
investigators acknowledged that the design of the study
and its statistical power were not developed specifically to
test treatments in patient subsets defined according to the
2 matching high-risk eligibility criterion. These subgroup

analyses were performed on patients with the high-risk criteria of ECS and/or positive margins and included 64%
(n 5 479 of 750 patients) of the randomized population
once the trials were pooled (Fig. 1).
Failure to perform appropriate multivariable
analyses

In the RTOG 9501 trial,9 multivariable analysis was not
performed to assess the independent impact of various
prognostic factors, such as T and N classification and tumor subsite. Multivariable analysis was also not performed for the collaborative study11 on pooled data from
the RTOG 9501 and EORTC 22931 trials.
No patient-centered information reported

There was no patient-centered reporting of the differential
functional impact or quality of life from CRT versus RT
in either of the 2 trial populations. Table 5 illustrates the
toxicity/harm from the addition of postoperative chemotherapy to adjuvant RT observed in the 2 trials.

In the long-term report of RTOG 9501 trial,12 the treatment effect of CRT versus RT was not significantly different for any of the study’s 3 endpoints—locoregional
control, disease-free survival, or overall survival—in all eligible patients or in the OPC subgroup. When the analyses were limited to the subgroup of patients with OPC
who had positive margins and/or ECS, again, the treat1750

Missing cause of death for study patients and
unexplained high mortality in the CRT arm

For an unplanned cause-specific analysis, the cause of death
was unknown or unreported in 42 of 410 patients (10%)
and was unrelated to or probably unrelated to cancer or treatment in another 44 of 410 patients (11%) (see Table 3 in
Cooper et al12). Thus, the cause of death was uncertain
for a total of 86 of 410 patients (21%). The overall percentage of deaths recorded in the CRT arm (70%; n 5
141 of 202 patients) was similar to that in the RT arm (n
5 148 of 208 patients; 71%); however, the CRT arm had
a higher percentage of death not attributed to the study cancer (Table 6). An analysis of death not attributed to the
study cancer in all eligible patients (n 5 410) indicated
that 24% (n 5 50 of 208 patients) died in the RT arm,
and 36% (n 5 72 of 202 patients) died in the CRT arm,
and the difference was statistically significant (P 5 .01).
An analysis of death not attributed to the study cancer in a
subgroup of patients with ECS and/or positive margins (n
5 242) (see the supplemental image in Cooper et al12)
indicated that 10% died in the RT arm (n 5 12 of 115
patients), and 19% died in the CRT arm (n 5 24 of 127
patients), and the difference trended toward significance
(P 5 .065).
Inconsistencies in numerical data

The total number of patients who were alive and diseasefree (n 5 87) (see Table 2 in Cooper et al12) was reported
as greater than the number of patients who remained alive
(n 5 63) (see: numbers at risk at 10 years, supplemental
image in Cooper et al12).

No reduction in distant metastasis was reported in the adjuvant CRT versus RT arms by either of the 2 trials9,10 (Table

DISCUSSION
Important shortcomings, such as lack of HPV/p16 information, use of unplanned and unadjusted subgroup analyses, and exclusion after randomization, limit the internal
and external validity of the studies cited by the NCCN for
its recommendation of postoperative CRT in patients
Cancer

who have OPC with ECS and/or positive margins. Additional analytical problems were identified, including
inconsistencies in numerical data. Consequently, we
deduce that these studies9-11 lack sufficient validity and
generalizability to reliably inform the use of postoperative
chemotherapy with adjuvant RT for patients with surgically treated, HPV-driven/p16-positive OPC.
The oropharynx as a subsite for the primary tumor
constituted a minority of patients in both RTOG 9501
and EORTC 22931. Tumors arising from different head
and neck subsites have different etiologies and oncologic
outcomes. In addition to the heterogeneity of subsites,
RTOG 9501 had a significant preponderance of sites in
the oropharynx in the CRT arm (see Heterogeneous study
population, above).9 Some proportion of the patients
with OPC in the 2 trials could have been HPV/p16-positive; however, with no assessment of HPV/p16 status, its
impact on outcomes remains unknown for both RTOG
9501 and EORTC 22931.
Imbalance in the distribution of T and N classifications between the treatment arms could substantially
affect the oncologic outcomes and, thus, undermine the
assessment of the relative treatment effects. Failure to
present the T and N classification distribution, combined
with lack of multivariate analyses to control for these factors, limits the internal validity of the RTOG 9501
results. Furthermore, postrandomization exclusion of
patients in RTOG 9501 is a factor that could have introduced bias in results (see Exclusion after randomization,
above) (Table 3).15,16 If the patients who were excluded
after randomization (22 in the CRT arm and 21 in the
RT arm) were actually included in an intention-to-treat
analysis and experienced very unbalanced outcomes, then
the observed results would most definitely be affected.

The discrepancy in numerical information about
key data points in the RTOG 9501 study is also of considerable concern (see Inconsistencies in numerical data,
above). In the 2004 publication,9 the authors state that all
surviving patients were followed for a minimum of 2
years. Yet there was a difference in the number of patients
who remained alive (ie, at risk of death) at the 2-year time
point in both9,12 reported analyses of the RTOG 9501
trial. The number in the 20049 and 201212 reports differs
by 19% despite the minimum follow-up of 2 years. What
could account for the discrepancy in the number of
patients who remained alive in the 2 studies, and what
impact does it have on the results?
Presentation of both absolute and relative effect sizes
is recommended by the CONSORT checklist.13 Reliance
on relative effect size alone can overestimate the actual
treatment benefit (Table 4). Lack of reporting on baseline
locoregional recurrence rates, as noted in the collaborative11 and long-term RTOG 950112 subgroup analyses of
patients with ECS and/or positive margins, makes it difficult to clearly judge the absolute treatment benefit from
the addition of postoperative chemotherapy. Our estimate
indicates that the absolute reduction in risk for locoregional recurrence with postoperative chemotherapy in the
1752

pooled study was 12%, but the reported relative reduction
was 42% (hazard ratio, 0.58) (Table 4).21
Subgroup analysis of patients pooled with the 2
high-risk features of ECS and/or positive margins11 forms
the basis of the NCCN recommendation for addition of
postoperative chemotherapy. Although acknowledged by
the study investigators, the subgroup analysis was not part
of the initial study design, nor was the statistical power
specifically developed to test the 2 treatments within this
subgroup. To reduce the risk of obtaining a spurious effect
from sample size reduction in unplanned subgroup analyses, a test for interaction between treatment and subgroup
is recommended to examine whether treatment effects differ between subgroups.17,18 It has also been estimated
that, if a trial has 80% power to detect the overall treatment effect, then reliable detection of a treatmentsubgroup interaction with the same power could require a
4-fold greater sample size.17 Failure to test interaction
along with lack of a priori specification of the subgroup
hypothesis and the absence of the subgroup variable of
ECS and/or positive margins as a stratification factor at randomization are important unmet criteria,18 which are often recommended to assess credibility of a subgroup
analysis. Moreover, unplanned subgroup analysis after
Cancer

patient exclusion from a randomized trial reverts the exercise to a nonrandomized comparison and, essentially, just
a cohort study.16 Cohort studies are exploratory,
hypothesis-generating exercises and cannot be considered
high-level evidence.16,19
Significant omissions from reporting of the
unplanned subgroup collaborative analyses21 further
weaken the strength of evidence generated. Multivariate
analyses were not reported for the collaborative study.11 It
is likely that there was heterogeneity in the individual
treatment arms for 1 or more important head and neck
cancer prognostic factors (eg, age, T or N classification,
and overall stage) that were not reported or adjusted in the
subgroup analyses. In addition, results from the subgroup
analyses were not stratified by the individual risk factors
of ECS or positive margins. These 2 high-risk factors are
biologically and therapeutically disparate. Thus, the benefit of combining postoperative chemotherapy with adjuvant RT remains unknown for each of these 2 factors
individually. This is important, because, in a head and
neck oncology practice, patients often present with either
ECS, positive margins, or both.
Long-term outcomes were recently reported for the
RTOG 9501 trial with no significant differences in outcome observed with the addition of chemotherapy to
postoperative RT. The authors reported that, at a median
follow-up of 9.4 years (range, 0.21 to 14.0 years) for surviving patients, there were no significant differences in
outcome in an analysis of all eligible randomized patients
with addition of chemotherapy to adjuvant RT.12
Unplanned subgroup analyses were performed again; and,
of the 18 analyses performed, a statistically significant difference was observed only in 1—the outcome of locoregional control in the ECS and/or positive margins
subgroup when patients with all tumor sites were pooled.
For the OPC subgroup, however, none of the outcomes
differed significantly either in all eligible patients or in the
ECS and/or positive margins subgroup. Furthermore, the
long-term RTOG 9501 report12 indicated a higher mortality rate among the patients who received CRT compared with those who received RT alone (Table 6). The
increased death rate among patients who received CRT
makes it difficult to draw conclusions about the benefit of
locoregional control. Moreover, the cause of death was
uncertain in 21% of patients, which further obfuscates
accurate determination of the ultimate treatment benefit.
When evaluating comparative treatments, it is crucial to consider both benefits and harms. By using various
endpoints, we observed a higher number needed to treat
and a lower number needed to harm for CRT versus RT

(Tables 4 and 5). For instance, in the RTOG 9501 trial,9
for every 9 patients who received postoperative CRT,
locoregional recurrence was prevented in 1 patient. When
considering harm, for every 2 patients who received postoperative CRT, 1 patient suffered severe acute toxicity.
For every 3 patients who received adjuvant CRT, 1
patient suffered severe acute and late toxicity. To avoid
the toxicity associated with treatments that have marginally higher survival, when informed, patients might select
treatments that are less toxic even if they are associated
with slightly reduced survival. However, prospective,
multi-institutional studies exclusive for a homogeneous
group of HPV/p16-positive patients with OPC assigned
randomly to RT or CRT will provide an accurate comparison of the average benefits versus harms from the 2 treatments for this specific disease.
Finally, the failure to assess the status of HPV or p16
prevents the generalizability of results from the RTOG
9501 and EORTC 22931 trials to patients with HPVdriven OPC. Among head and neck cancers, HPV status
defines a separate disease entity from the smoking-driven
cancers, and the epidemiologic20 and clinical3,21 differences between the 2 are supported by a distinct molecular
biology.22 Both RTOG 9501 and EORTC 22931
recorded improved locoregional control with the addition
of chemotherapy. Achieving locoregional control is a
greater challenge in non-HPV/p16-negative tumors
because of field cancerization compared with HPV-driven/
p16-positive OPC, in which several recent publications
have demonstrated excellent locoregional control with
treatment.3,23-25 Although infrequent, distant metastatic
spread of disease is the most common mode of failure in
HPV-driven/p16-positive OPC.3,26 Neither RTOG
9501 nor EORTC 22931 reported a significant reduction
in distant metastasis in the postoperative CRT arm.
Moreover, factors like ECS and advanced lymph node status, which are clearly associated with a poor prognosis in
patients with smoking-driven cancer, are now reported as
lacking a prognostic impact in patients with HPV-driven,
p16-positive OPC.4-6,27,28
Thus, we believe that it is unjustified to classify the
existing evidence for the NCCN recommendation to add
chemotherapy to postoperative RT for patients who have
OPC with ECS and/or positive margins as high level, especially if they are HPV/p16-positive. The strength of the
scientific evidence from these articles is lower than the
generally accorded high-level status, especially in the light
of findings from the long-term follow-up of 1 of the trials.
The evidence is based not on randomized clinical trials
but on study investigator-acknowledged, exploratory,

hypothesis-generating, unplanned, underpowered subgroup analyses of head and neck cancers of all sites, which
are equivalent to cohort studies (ie, level 3 evidence).19
The unknown HPV/p16 status of the trials’ patients compels head and neck oncologists to judge the current
NCCN guideline as of unknown relevance in its application to patients with HPV-related OPC. This mandates a
focused re-evaluation of recommendations for the use of
postoperative CRT over RT alone.
Conclusions

This critical appraisal of the literature on the role of adjuvant CRT in surgically treated oropharynx patients with
adverse features of ECS and/or positive margins identified
multiple methodological and analytical problems that
undermine both internal validity and external generalizability of the results. The less than high-level evidence upon
which the NCCN guideline for the use of adjuvant CRT is
based mandates a thorough re-evaluation, especially in the
context of the HPV/p16-positive oropharynx epidemic.
