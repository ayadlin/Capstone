ABSTRACT
Patients with primary HER2-positive breast cancer benefit from HER2-targeted
therapies. Nevertheless, a significant proportion of these patients die of disease
progression due to mechanisms of drug resistance. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as
critical core regulators of drug resistance that act by modulating the epithelialto-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer-related immune responses. In this study,
we investigated the association between the expression of a specific subset of 14 miRNAs
involved in EMT processes and immune functions and the response to neoadjuvant
trastuzumab and chemotherapy in 52 patients with HER2-overexpressing breast tumors.
The expression of only a single miRNA, miR-21, was significantly associated with residual
disease (p = 0.030) and increased after trastuzumab-chemotherapy (p  =  0.012).
A target prediction analysis coupled with in vitro and in vivo validations revealed
that miR-21 levels inversely correlated with the expression of PTEN (rs = −0.502;
p = 0.005) and PDCD4 (rs = −0.426; p = 0.019), which differentially influenced the
drug sensitivity of HER2-positive breast cancer cells. However, PTEN expression was

only marginally associated with residual disease. We further demonstrated that miR21 was able to affect the response to both trastuzumab and chemotherapy, triggering
an IL-6/STAT3/NF-κB-mediated signaling loop and activating the PI3K pathway. Our
findings support the ability of miR-21 signaling to sustain EMT and shape the tumor
immune microenvironment in HER2-positive breast cancer. Collectively, these data
provide a rationale for using miR-21 expression as a biomarker to select trastuzumabchemotherapy-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer patients who may benefit from
treatments containing PI3K inhibitors or immunomodulatory drugs.

Therefore, a comprehensive molecular understanding of
the pathways associated with resistance to trastuzumab
and chemotherapy might greatly aid the development of
more effective targeted therapies, whereas the discovery
of clinical molecular predictors of response will allow a
more personalized treatment approach for patients with
HER2-amplified breast cancer.
In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of
small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression,
have emerged as crucial regulators of the drug response
that act by shaping the tumor immune microenvironment
and modulating EMT [22–26]. Hence, identifying and
targeting miRNAs that regulate pathways involved in
tumor-associated inflammation and EMT may result in an
effective integrative approach to overcome drug resistance
in HER2-overexpressing breast cancers. In this study,
we investigated the association and biological role of a
specific subset of miRNAs involved in EMT and tumorassociated immune pathways. Specifically, we evaluated
the response to neoadjuvant trastuzumab and chemotherapy
in two cohorts of HER2-positive breast cancer patients.
Furthermore, we identified the molecular mechanisms
underlying miRNA-mediated drug resistance using in vitro
and in vivo assays.

INTRODUCTION
HER2-overexpressing breast cancer represents
approximately 20% of human breast cancers and is
associated with an increased risk of tumor recurrence
and reduced overall survival [1, 2]. The overexpression
of HER2 enables the constitutive activation of growth
factor signaling pathways and thereby serves as an
oncogenic driver of breast cancer [3]. Despite the
clinical benefit of HER2-targeted therapies, a substantial
percentage of patients die of disease progression due
to drug resistance [1–5]. Elucidating the molecular
pathways involved in trastuzumab resistance has been
difficult due to the variety of mechanisms of action
of this drug. Multiple mechanisms of resistance have
been proposed, including the deregulation of the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway,
which is caused by activating mutations of PIK3CA
or a loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN),
the reduced receptor-antibody binding affinity, and
the increased signaling via alternative HER and
non-HER family receptor tyrosine kinases [3–9].
However, final validations based on analyses of human
tumor samples have been limited and are not entirely
reproducible [3, 10]. Furthermore, trastuzumab in
either the early or metastatic setting is administered
with cytotoxic chemotherapy, which may be a further
potential confounding factor in the search for specific
predictive clinical biomarkers of drug resistance.
Recently, additional pathways have been demonstrated
to contribute to the resistance of HER2-positive breast
tumors to trastuzumab and chemotherapy. Epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT) is a central biological
event that allows cancer cells to avoid apoptosis
and cellular senescence, which contributes to tumor
progression [11]. Anti-HER2 and chemotherapeutic
agents have been shown to increase the number of cells
with mesenchymal traits and contribute to multidrug
resistance in breast cancer [12–16]. Furthermore, the
overexpression of HER2 itself regulates EMT by directly
activating downstream signaling, such as the PI3K
pathway, and the induction of IL-6 release from cancer
cells [15, 17]. Indeed, IL-6 has been demonstrated to
activate STAT3/NF-κB signaling, which consequently
sustains EMT in breast cancer, and to modulate the
tumor microenvironment, linking inflammation to
cancer progression and drug resistance [13, 17–21].

RESULTS
Overexpression of miR-21 is associated with
resistance to neoadjuvant trastuzumabchemotherapy in HER2-positive breast cancer
patients
Based on a comprehensive literature review, we
selected 14 functionally relevant miRNAs involved in the
regulation of EMT and anti-tumor immune response and
evaluated their clinical significance in primary HER2positive (n = 22) and HER2-negative (n = 21) breast
cancer patients who received neoadjuvant trastuzumabchemotherapy or chemotherapy alone, respectively
(Table 1, Supplementary Table 1). Within this subset of
miRNAs, miR-373 and miR-18b were not detectable in
the majority of samples and were consequently excluded
from subsequent analyses. We found that only a single
miRNA, miR-21, was significantly differentially
expressed between HER2-positive patients who achieved
a pathological complete response (pCR) and patients with
residual disease (RD) ( p = 0.030) (Table 1). None of the

cancer cell line (SKBR3) treated with a miR-21 inhibitor
alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs
or trastuzumab. The miR-21 inhibitor alone was able
to decrease the viability of untreated cells ( p = 0.042),
but it was less effective than treatment with paclitaxel
( p = 0.001), doxorubicin ( p = 0.002), and trastuzumab
( p = 0.002) (Figure 2). Notably, the inhibition of miR-21
significantly increased the ability of paclitaxel ( p = 0.005),
doxorubicin ( p = 0.001), and trastuzumab ( p = 0.004)
to reduce the viability of SKBR3 cells, indicating that
miR-21 is involved in both trastuzumab and chemotherapy
resistance (Figure 2).
To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying
miR-21-mediated therapy resistance, we searched for
predicted and validated target genes by combining
several target prediction databases, including miRBase
(http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk), TargetScan (http://www
.targetscan.org), and Tarbase (http://diana.cslab.ece.ntua.
gr/tarbase). Based on these analyses and the biological
roles played in EMT and immune signaling [13, 27], PTEN
and PDCD4 were selected for further evaluation. We found
that inhibition of miR-21 substantially increased PTEN
and PDCD4 expression in SKBR3 cells (Supplementary
Figure 1), confirming that both proteins are direct targets
of miR-21. Furthermore, both PTEN (rs = −0.502;
p  = 0.005) (Figure 3A, 3B) and PDCD4 (rs  =  −0.426;
p = 0.019) (Figure 3C, 3D) protein expression significantly
and inversely correlated with the expression of miR-21
in HER2-positive breast cancer patients. However, only
PTEN showed a mild association with response to therapy
( p = 0.033) (Supplementary Table 2). Overall, these
findings suggest that the reduced expression of these

miRNAs analyzed correlated with drug response in HER2negative patients, suggesting that miR-21 may be a specific
biomarker of resistance for HER2-positive breast cancer
(Table 1). A further analysis of an additional cohort of 30
HER2-positive breast cancers (Supplementary Table 1)
confirmed that miR-21 overexpression was associated
with RD ( p = 0.012) (Figure 1A), indicating that miR-21
is indeed involved in resistance to neoadjuvant treatment
consisting of trastuzumab and chemotherapy. Notably,
although the baseline levels of miR-21 predicted resistance
to trastuzumab-chemotherapy treatment, we found that
its expression was further upregulated after such therapy
( p  =  0.016) (Figure 1B). These data indicate that an
additional increase in miR-21 induced by the current
therapy may sustain a molecular loop responsible for drug
resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer. To further assess
the ability of miR-21 to discriminate the patients’ responses
to trastuzumab-based therapy, we performed a receiveroperating characteristic (ROC) analysis of the validation
dataset. The results of this analysis confirmed that miR-21
expression was able to discriminate patients who achieved
a pCR from those with RD after neoadjuvant therapy with
high accuracy (AUC = 0.772) (Figure 1C).

protein markers alone may not be sufficient to predict
response to preoperative trastuzumab and chemotherapy.
To further explore the role of these targets in miR-21mediated drug resistance, we evaluated the effects of PTEN
and PDCD4 silencing on the viability of SKBR3 cells treated
with paclitaxel, doxorubicin, or trastuzumab (Figure 4). We
found that a reduction of PTEN consistently increased the
viability of untreated cells ( p = 0.022) and enhanced the
resistance of SKBR3 cells to treatments with doxorubicin
( p = 0.012) and trastuzumab ( p = 0.001), but failed to affect
the viability of paclitaxel-treated cells (Figure 4A, 4B).
Conversely, the downregulation of PDCD4 slightly increased
the survival of untreated cells ( p = 0.036), and significantly
reduced the sensitivity of SKBR3 cells to both paclitaxel
( p = 0.005) and doxorubicin ( p = 0.001) (Figure 4C, 4D).
These results suggest that distinct molecular mechanisms,
specifically those affecting the sensitivity to different drugs,
may be responsible for the miR-21-mediated resistance to
trastuzumab and chemotherapy in HER2-positive cancer
cells.

involvement in the induction of a local immune response,
which may sustain EMT in HER2-overexpressing cancer
cells. Our data demonstrated that PTEN silencing, but
not PDCD4 silencing, increased the release of IL-6 from
SKBR3 cells ( p = 0.001) (Figure 5A), and that the direct
stimulation of cells with IL-6 increased the expression
of miR-21 ( p = 0.016) (Figure 5B). In addition, IL-6
induced EMT, as indicated by the down-regulation
of E-cadherin and the up-regulation of vimentin,
activated the PI3K pathway (via the downregulation
of PTEN and up-regulation of phosphorylated AKT),
and triggered an inflammatory loop by increasing the
levels of phosphorylated STAT3 and NF-κB proteins
(Figure 5C). Overall, these results suggest that miR-21
signaling sustains EMT in these cancer cells to cause
tumor progression and therapy resistance, and may affect
the tumor immune microenvironment by activating IL-6
signaling. In support of these findings, we also found that
HER2-positive tumors expressing high levels of miR-21
showed a significant high content of CD68-positive
macrophages (rs = 0.417; p = 0.022), supporting the
immunomodulatory role of this miRNA (Figure 5D).

success, drug resistance, particularly to trastuzumab,
remains an important clinical challenge. Several preclinical
models have identified different mechanisms of resistance
[1–9]. However, clinical studies have demonstrated the
limited value of potential molecular predictors of response
or resistance to anti-HER2-based therapies [3, 10]. In
this study, we assessed the expression of a subset of
specific miRNAs that are involved in the modulation
of the tumor-associated immune response and EMT
features and evaluated their association with pCR or
RD in two independent cohorts of HER2-positive breast
cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant trastuzumab
and chemotherapy. The expression of a single miRNA,
miR-21, was specifically higher in patients with HER2amplified breast cancer with RD compared with patients
who achieved pCR, indicating that miR-21 is an important
molecular mediator of drug resistance. Consequently,
we demonstrated that the miR-21 expression levels were
further amplified following trastuzumab and chemotherapy,
suggesting a possible increase in metastatic potential.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Consistent with our findings, chemotherapy-induced DNA
damage has been shown to upregulate the expression of
miR-21 by activating NF-κB, which enables breast cancer
cells to override DNA damage-induced apoptosis and
enhances their invasiveness [28]. Therefore, higher levels
of miR-21 may contribute to both primary and acquired
resistance to trastuzumab-chemotherapy treatment in
patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Trastuzumab,
either in the early or metastatic setting, is co-administered
with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Thus, the identification
of reliable markers of trastuzumab resistance should be
carefully evaluated, and the presence of high levels of
miR-21 may suggest trastuzumab resistance independently
of the administered chemotherapy. Overall, our data
indicate that the measurement of the expression of miR-21
at baseline or in residual cancer after neoadjuvant therapy
may be used to understand the likelihood of therapeutic
response and to select patients harboring HER2-positive,
drug-resistant tumors who may benefit from novel
pharmacological agents.

Herein, we confirmed that miR-21 is involved in
EMT and targets PTEN and PDCD4 in HER2-positive
breast cancer patients, which corroborates previous findings
[13, 29]. Our data support that the miR-21-mediated
epigenetic silencing of both tumor suppressor genes,
particularly PTEN, could be an important mechanism of
resistance to trastuzumab-chemotherapy in patients with
HER2-positive tumors. As a result, we demonstrated that
the downregulation of PTEN and PDCD4 differentially
influenced the sensitivity of HER2-positive breast cancer
cells to current drugs. Several experimental models
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

have proven that the activation of the PI3K pathway,
especially via the loss of PTEN, is responsible to determine
resistance to trastuzumab [3–8]. Notably, a lack of PTEN
expression only marginally correlated with RD after
neoadjuvant trastuzumab-chemotherapy in this study.
These findings are supported by recent studies that suggest
that a loss of PTEN is associated with poor outcome
but has very limited predictive value to measure the
response to trastuzumab-based therapy [30, 31]. Potential
explanations for these conflicting results are linked to a
lack of standardization for PTEN status determination and
37275

consequent challenges of reproducibility across different
studies, complex mechanisms of drug resistance, and
confounding effects from different types of concomitant
chemotherapies [3, 5, 10]. These findings, together with
the lack of association between PDCD4 and response to
trastuzumab and chemotherapy treatment, suggest that
either PTEN or PDCD4 alone, likely may not reliably
predict the response of HER2-positive breast cancer
patients to therapy. Conversely, we demonstrated that
the inhibition of miR-21 synergistically increased the
ability of chemotherapeutic agents and trastuzumab to
reduce the viability of HER2-positive breast cancer cells.
These results indicate that miR-21 leads to resistance to
trastuzumab and chemotherapy via different mechanisms,
confirming that miR-21 could serve as a comprehensive
predictive marker of response to such therapy for HER2positive breast cancer patients.
Despite the important role of miR-21-mediated
PTEN and PDCD4 deficiency in drug resistance, the
response to anti-HER2 and chemotherapeutic agents
may be dependent on additional mechanisms, including
the boosting of a local inflammatory signaling, which
is responsible for the release of specific cytokines and
the expansion of tumor cells with an EMT phenotype
[13, 18, 28]. Consistently, we found that PTEN silencing
increased the production of IL-6, which consequently
increased the expression of miR-21 and induced EMT.
Our results are in agreement with previous findings
showing that the release of IL-6 by mesenchymal cancer
cells and tumor-associated macrophages was able to
induce EMT and macrophage polarization toward a
pro-tumoral M2 profile [13, 18, 19, 32, 33]. In addition,
our in vitro assays demonstrated that the silencing of
PTEN in HER2-amplified breast cancer cells was indeed
able to activate the PI3K pathway and an inflammatory
signaling cascade driven by the STAT3/NF-κB pathway.
The activation of both PI3K/AKT and STAT3 signaling
has been recognized to shape the tumor immune
microenvironment and modulate the anti-tumor immune
response, which emphasizes the therapeutic potential
of targeting both oncogenic and immune checkpoint
pathways (e.g. PD-1 or CTLA4) in drug-resistant HER2positive breast tumors [34]. Furthermore, we demonstrated
that miR-21 overexpression correlated with the infiltration
of macrophages, suggesting a potential crosstalk between
the tumor and immune microenvironment that sustains
an EMT phenotype and drug resistance in HER2-positive
cancer cells. Our data are reinforced by the association
between a low content of macrophages and the response
to neoadjuvant therapy, as well as the increased overall
survival of HER2-positive breast cancer patients [35].
The infiltration of macrophages is responsible for the
recruitment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, which
are now emerging as potential prognostic, and possibly
predictive, factors in HER2-positive breast cancers
[35–38]. Indeed, clinically relevant reciprocal crosstalk
between adaptive and innate immune cells, particularly
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

macrophages and T lymphocytes, has been demonstrated
in breast cancer, and warrants further study [35, 39].
Collectively, these results suggest that miR-21
overexpression may be used as a comprehensive predictive
biomarker of trastuzumab-chemotherapy resistance and
that patients harboring HER2-positive tumors expressing
high levels of miR-21 may benefit from the addition of
PI3K inhibitors or immunomodulatory drugs to current
anti-HER2 therapies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients characteristic and tumor samples
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) core
biopsies were retrospectively collected from 52 patients
harboring histologically confirmed HER2-positive breast
cancer who underwent neoadjuvant treatment consisting
of trastuzumab and chemotherapy at Vall d’Hebron
University Hospital and Humanitas Clinical and Research
Institute from 2005 to 2011. Paired post-chemotherapy
specimens were also available for 12 of these samples.
Ethical approval was obtained from the review boards
at the Spanish and Italian Institutions. Tissues from 21
HER2-negative breast cancer patients who underwent
neoadjuvant anthracycline- or taxane-based chemotherapy
were also collected and used as controls. The patient
characteristics are presented in Supplementary Table 1.
HER2-overexpressing breast cancer patients were divided
into a discovery (n = 22) and a validation (n = 30) cohort.
Response to therapy was dichotomized as pCR (defined
by the absence of a residual invasive tumor in the breast
and axillary lymph nodes) or RD. Among the 52 HER2positive patients, 28 patients achieved a pCR, whereas the
other 24 cases had RD (Supplementary Table 1).

RNA isolation and quantitative real-time
PCR analysis
Total RNA from two 6-μm FFPE sections was
extracted using a High Pure miRNA Isolation Kit (Roche,
Milan, Italy) based on the company’s specifications. The
extracted RNA was then eluted in RNase-free water and
stored at - 80°C until use. Based on a literature review,
we selected the most functionally relevant miRNAs
associated with immune function and EMT regulation (let7b-3p, miR-18b-3p, miR-20a-3p, miR-21–5p, miR-34a-5p,
miR-106b-3p, miR-107, miR-145–3p,  miR-155–5p,
miR-181b-5p, miR-200b-3p, miR-221–3p, miR-373–3p
and miR-495–3p) and evaluated their expression in
22 HER2-positive (discovery cohort) and 21 HER2negative core biopsies by quantitative real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR). Briefly, total RNA was reverse transcribed
using the miRCURY LNA™ Universal RT microRNA
PCR kit (Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark). The expression
of each miRNA was assayed on the microRNA
custom  Pick-&-Mix panel (Exiqon) in a LightCycler

480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche). Negative controls
without template and the cDNA synthesis control (UniSp6)
were included. All data were normalized to the average
of assays detected in all samples (average Ct-assay Ct).
The two miRNAs expressed in all samples (miR-16–5p
and let-7a-5p) were used to normalize miRNA expression.
Upon the selection based on a statistical analysis, the
expression of miR-21–5p was further analyzed in the
validation cohort (n = 30). Briefly, 20 ng of total RNA
from each sample was reverse transcribed using the
TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription kit (Life
Technologies, Monza, Italy). Each amplification reaction
was performed in triplicate. The miRNA expression was
quantified in relation to the expression of small nuclear U6
RNA. The relative expression of miR-21 was calculated
using the comparative Ct method.

whereas doxorubicin and paclitaxel were dissolved in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The cells were treated with
paclitaxel (25 nM), doxorubicin (1 μM), trastuzumab
(10 μg/mL) or control vehicle. Recombinant IL-6 (R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, USA) was used at a concentration
of 10 ng/mL.

Cell lines transfection experiments
Small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific to
human PTEN and PDCD4 (Dharmacon, Lafayette,
USA) or control siRNA that does not target any
sequence in the human genome (scrambled) were used
in transient transfection experiments. We optimized the
transfection conditions for SKBR3 cells as previously
described [40]. Gene silencing was performed in three
replicates in 96-well plates under predetermined optimal
transfection conditions. Anti-miR-21 inhibitor and its
corresponding negative control (anti-NC; Ambion,
Life Technologies) were then transfected into SKBR3
cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. The final
concentrations of miR-21 inhibitor and anti-NC were
30 nmol/L, and the treatments were started 24 h after
transfection.

Immunohistochemistry
The 30 samples of the validation cohort were
subjected to immunohistochemistry (IHC). FFPE sections
(3  μm) were deparaffinized and subjected to epitope
retrieval. Tissue sections were treated with Peroxidase
Blocking Reagent (Dako, Milan, Italy) and Background
Sniper (Biocare, Milan, Italy) and then incubated with
antibodies to PTEN (Cell Signaling, Danvers, USA),
PDCD4 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and CD68 (Dako).
Negative control slides without primary antibody were also
included in the analysis. Immunodetection was performed
with the Envision Plus Horseradish Peroxidase Kit (Dako)
and diaminobenzidine (DAB; Biocare) was used for
colorimetric visualization followed by counterstaining with
hematoxylin. The PTEN and PDCD4 expression levels were
semi-quantitatively scored based on the staining intensity
(0  = negative; 1  =  weak; 2  =  moderate; and 3 = strong)
and the percentage of positive cells (0 < 1%; 1 = 1–25%;
2 = 26–50%; 3 = 51–80%; and 4 > 80%). Ten visual fields
from different areas of each tumor were used to evaluate
the IHC staining. A composite immunoreactive score (IRS)
was calculated by multiplying the intensity by the percentage
scores, and the staining intensity was graded as follows:
0 = IRS 0–3 (negative), 1 = IRS 4–6 (weakly positive),
2 = IRS 7–9 (positive), and 3 = IRS 10–12 (strongly
positive). Patients were stratified by low (0–1) or high (2–3)
PTEN or PDCD4 expression for statistical analyses. The
CD68 staining was scored based on the infiltration density
of CD68 positive cells, which ranged from 0 (absent) to
3 (dense).

Western blotting
The protein extracts were isolated using RIPA
buffer containing protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich,
Milan, Italy) and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The antibody
against anti-PDCD4 was obtained from Abcam. AntiE-cadherin, anti-vimentin, anti-PTEN, anti-phosphoNF-κB (p65), anti-phospho-STAT3, and anti-phosphoAKT antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling.
The membranes were then incubated with the appropriate
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Millipore,
Billerica, USA), and the protein signal was detected
using a chemiluminescent substrate (Millipore). β-actin
was used as a loading control (Santa Cruz, Heidelberg,
Germany).

Cell viability assay
Viable cells were identified using the 3-[4,
5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
assay (MTT; Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, cells were plated
(3 × 103 cells/well) on 96-well plates and incubated
overnight to allow cell attachment. The cells were then
treated with paclitaxel, doxorubicin, or trastuzumab for
48 hours. Subsequently, the MTT reagent (5 mg/ml in PBS)
was added to each well, followed by incubation for 4 h at
37°C. After the incubation, the MTT crystals in each well
were solubilized in DMSO, and the absorbance was read at
560 nm with an iMark plate reader (BioRad, Milan, Italy).
All treatments were performed in triplicate, and the cell
viability was expressed as a percentage of the untreated
control (mean ± S.D.).

Cell cultures and treatments
SKBR3 cell lines were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, USA). The
cells were maintained in RPMI containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin (Life
Technologies, Monza, Italy) at 37°C in an atmosphere
of 5% CO2. Trastuzumab was dissolved in sterile water,

Statistical analysis
The differential expression of miRNAs between
patient subgroups was evaluated with a nonparametric
Mann-Whitney test, and the Wilcoxon-signed rank test
was used to compare matched samples. To evaluate the
predictive accuracy of the selected miRNAs, (ROC)
curves and areas under the curves (AUC) with a 95%
confidence interval were calculated. The association
between miRNAs and selected targets was explored with
Spearman’s correlation analysis. Fisher’s exact test was
used to compare protein expression levels between groups.
All tests were two-sided, and the level of significance was
set to p < 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism version 5.
