Human Colon Carcinoma Cells

Abstract
Aberrant activation of Hedgehog (HH) signaling is implicated in many human cancers. Classical HH signaling
is characterized by Smoothened (Smo)-dependent activation of Gli1 and Gli2, which transcriptionally regulate
target genes. A small molecule inhibitor of Gli1 and Gli2, GANT61, was used to block HH signaling in human
colon carcinoma cell lines that express HH signaling components. GANT61 administration induced robust
cytotoxicity in 5 of 6 cell lines and moderate cytotoxicity in the remaining 1 cell line. In comparison, the classical
Smo inhibitor, cyclopamine, induced modest cytotoxicity. Further, GANT61 treatment abolished the clonogenicity of all six human colon carcinoma cell lines. Analysis of the molecular mechanisms of GANT61-induced
cytotoxicity in HT29 cells showed increased Fas expression and decreased expression of PDGFRa, which also
regulates Fas. Furthermore, DR5 expression was increased whereas Bcl-2 (direct target of Gli2) was downregulated following GANT61 treatment. Suppression of Gli1 by shRNA mimicked the changes in gene expression
observed in GANT61-treated cells. Overexpression of dominant-negative FADD (to abrogate Fas/DR5-mediated
death receptor signaling) and/or Bcl-2 (to block mitochondria-mediated apoptosis) partially rescued GANT61induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells. Thus, activated GLI genes repress DR5 and Fas expressions while
upregulating Bcl-2 and PDGFRa expressions to inhibit Fas and facilitate cell survival. Collectively, these results
highlight the importance of Gli activation downstream of Smo as a therapeutic target in models of human colon
carcinoma. Cancer Res; 71(3); 1092–102. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Activation of the canonical Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway is initiated by the binding of HH ligands (namely Shh, Ihh,
or Dhh) to the transmembrane receptor Patched (Ptc), which
becomes internalized leading to the activation of the transmembrane signaling molecule Smo via release from Ptcdependent suppression. Smo activates the final arbiter of
HH signaling, the Gli family of transcription factors that
regulate HH target gene expression (1).
HH signaling is important during normal embryonic development and its aberrant activation has been associated with
many human cancers (reviewed in ref. 2). HH signaling is also
critical in the regulation of cellular proliferation, stemness, cell
fate determination, and cellular survival in a variety of organs
(3, 4). Gli1 is amplified in glioma (5), osteosarcoma, and
rhabdomyosarcoma (6), whereas Gli2 is amplified in oral
squamous cell carcinoma (7). Mutations in Ptc or Smo are
also prevalent in basal cell carcinomas, medulloblastomas,

and cancers of the esophagus and bladder (reviewed in ref. 8),
and sustained and activated HH–Gli signaling has led to the
development of medulloblastomas in Ptcþ/ mice (9). Melanomas and carcinomas of the prostate have further shown a
HH–Gli signaling axis, inhibited by cyclopamine at the level of
Smo (10, 11). In gastrointestinal cancers, HH signaling activation occurs not by mutation or amplification of signaling
molecules, but via transcriptional upregulation of the HH
ligands (8). It has recently been suggested that HH signaling
progresses during colon carcinogenesis (12, 13) and in metastatic disease (13), whereas in normal colonic tissue, HH
signaling is involved in differentiation (14, 15). However, very
little is known regarding the specific role of HH signaling in
regulating cellular survival and proliferation in colon cancers,
and the downstream target genes involved in determination of
cell fate.
The Gli family of transcription factors has activator and
repressor functions that are defined only partially and can
respond to combinatorial and cooperative Gli activity (3).
Although dispensable for normal development (16, 17), Gli1
plays a key role in HH-driven cancers (4, 16), whereas less is
known about the role of Gli2 in HH signaling in tumors (17).
Gli2 appears to be the primary activator of HH signaling, with
Gli1 as a transcriptional target of Gli2, which may amplify HHinduced, Gli2-mediated transcription of Gli1 target genes (8,
18–20); Gli2 and Gli1 also induce transcription of overlapping
and distinct sets of target genes (17). The roles of Gi1 and Gli2
in HH-driven cellular survival and cell death responses remain

HH-Dependent Survival in Human Colon Carcinoma Cell Lines

ill-defined, and specifically, their role in cellular survival of
colon cancer is unknown.
We have recently profiled genes that are regulated downstream of Gli1 and Gli2 that are either direct or indirect targets
and are involved in cellular proliferation including genes that
regulate the cell cycle, such as Cyclin D, CYCLIN B, FOXM1,
CDC25 family members, and CDC2 (4, 8, 21–23). Other genes
that are involved in cell signaling or the regulation of cell
survival including PDGFRa (24, 25) and BCL-2 (26) also function downstream of the Gli proteins. PDGFRa is a gene that
encodes a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor, expressed in
human cancers, and whose expression is regulated by Gli1
(25). Thus, decreased expression of Gli1 reduces the expression of PDGFRa, which via Erk, removes the repression
imposed on Fas expression (24, 27), a molecule that is well
known to be an important regulator of cell death in colon
cancer cells (28, 29). Further, overexpression of Gli1 or
PDGFRa has rendered basal cell carcinoma cells resistant
to cyclopamine (27). The BCL-2 gene encodes an integral outer
membrane protein that blocks apoptotic cell death and is
expressed and functional in colon carcinoma cells (30). Bcl-2 is
transcriptionally regulated by Gli2 (26), in contrast to its
family member Bcl-xL.
To identify downstream targets of the Gli genes that
regulate cellular survival in the context of colon cancer, we
employed a small molecule inhibitor of Gli1 and Gli2, GANT61,
identified in a cell-based small molecule screen for inhibitors
of Gli1-mediated transcription (31). GANT61 acts in the
nucleus to block Gli function, inhibits both Gli1- and Gli2mediated transcription, and shows a high degree of selectivity
for HH/Gli signaling (31). In a panel of 6 well-characterized
human colon carcinoma cell lines, we showed that inhibition
of the HH signaling pathway by targeting the Gli genes using
GANT61 induced significant cell death in all the cell lines
whereas the conventional Smo inhibitor, cyclopamine,
showed only modest cytotoxic activity. The components of
the canonical HH signaling pathway were present in all cell
lines. In further detailed analyses of HT29 cells, GANT61
decreased both Gli1 and Gli2 expressions, and decreased
Gli-luciferase reporter activity. In addition, partial knockdown
of both Gli1 and Gli2 expressions using shRNA conferred
equivalent and partial resistance to GANT61-induced cytotoxicity confirming that cytotoxicity is dependent on Gli
inhibition in response to GANT61 treatment. Further,
decreased expression of PDGFRa concomitant with elevation
in Fas, elevated expression of the death receptor DR5 (known
to be functional in colon carcinoma cells; ref. 32), and
decreased expression of the antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2 were
shown, and PARP cleavage and activation of caspase-3 were
also induced. Similar changes in gene expression were
obtained by Gli1 knockdown using Gli1shRNA. Using HT29
cells transfected with a dominant-negative mutant form of
FADD (DNFADD; ref. 33) to inhibit the function of both Fas
and DR5, partial protection from GANT61-induced cell death
was observed. When Bcl-2 was overexpressed prior to GANT61
treatment, partial protection from GANT61-induced cytotoxicity was also observed. Similar partial protection was obtained
when DNFADD and Bcl-2 were overexpressed simultaneously

in HT29 cells, suggesting that the extrinsic pathway via death
receptors and the intrinsic pathway via the mitochondria are
not mutually exclusive for the induction of cell death, and
contribute to the regulation of HH-dependent cell survival in
colon cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
HT29, HCT116, SW480, and HCT8 cells were obtained
from ATCC. GC3/c1 and VRC5/c1 cells were established in
our laboratories from a human colon adenocarcinoma xenograft model (34). Cell lines were routinely verified by morphology, growth characteristics, response to cytotoxic
agents (Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining). cDNA
microarray gene profiles were also characteristic. Cell lines
were verified biannually to be mycoplasma-free. Cells were
maintained in the presence of folate-free RPMI 1640 medium
containing 10% dFBS and 80 nmol/L [6RS]5-methyltetrahydrofolate. Antibodies against SHH, Ptc, Smo, PARP,
PDGFRa, Fas, b-actin, and HSP90a/b were purchased from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against Gli2, DR5, and
caspase-3 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology,
and against Gli1 from Novus Biologicals. GANT61 was
purchased from Alexis Biochemicals, and cyclopamine from
Toronto Research Chemicals.
Gli1shRNA, Gli2shRNA, DNFADD, and Bcl-2
transduction
Gli1shRNA (50 -CGCCTTGAGAACCTCAGGCTGGACCAGCT-30 ) and Gli2shRNA (50 -CCACGGAAAGCACTGGCTTCTCTGACAAC-30 ) were obtained from OriGene Technologies, Inc.
HT29 cells stably expressing Gli1shRNA or Gli2shRNA were
generated by transducing HT29 cells with scrambled shRNA
(control), Gli1shRNA, or Gli2shRNA expressing retroviruses
for 48 hours (50% retroviral supernatant and 50% normal
growth media). Following transduction, the cells were
washed 3 times with 1 PBS and allowed to grow for 3
passages before screening for gene expression. Once
decreased expression of the targeted gene was confirmed,
the cells were used for experiments. Stable expression of
Gli1shRNA and Gli2shRNA was ensured by culturing cells in
the presence of a selection antibiotic, puromycin (1 mg/mL).
The HT29 cell line simultaneously expressing both
Gli1shRNA and Gli2shRNA was generated by transducing
HT29 cells stably expressing Gli2shRNA with Gli1shRNA
expressing retroviruses, for 48 hours (50% retroviral supernatant and 50% normal growth media). The transduced cells
were washed 3 times with 1 PBS and used for experiments.
HT29Bcl-2 (30) and HT29DNFADD (30), stably overexpressing Bcl-2 or DNFADD, respectively, were generated by
retroviral gene transduction, as described. The HT29 cell
line simultaneously expressing both DNFADD and Bcl-2 was
generated by transducing HT29 cells stably expressing Bcl-2,
with DNFADD expressing retroviruses, for 48 hours (50%
retroviral supernatant and 50% normal growth media). The
transduced cells were washed 3 times with 1 PBS and used
for experiments.

Clonogenic assays
The cells were plated at densities of 1,500 (HT29, HCT8,
HCT116) and 3,000 (SW480, GC3/c1, VRC5/c1) cells/well in 6well plates. Following overnight attachment, cells were treated, in triplicate, with varied concentrations of GANT61 (0–20
mmol/L) for 72 hours. Drug was removed and replaced with
fresh media containing dThd (20 mmol/L) for a period equivalent to 7 cell doublings (7 days for HT29, SW480, GC3/c1, and
VRC5/c1; 5 days for HCT8 and HCT116). Cells were washed
with 1 Dulbecco's PBS (without Caþþ or Mgþþ) and allowed
to dry overnight. The following day, cells were stained with
crystal violet, and colonies analyzed using an Alpha Innotech
imager.
Annexin V/PI staining and flow cytometric analysis
Annexin V/PI staining and flow cytometric analysis was
performed as described previously (35). Briefly, cells were
treated, in duplicate, as described in the figure legends, after
which they were collected by trypsinization and incubated
with Annexin V FITC (BD Biosciences) and PI (Sigma) prior to
analysis using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Raw data were
analyzed by CellQuest software.

Gli-luciferase assay
The Gli-luciferase reporter construct (kindly provided by Dr.

Rune Toftga rd, Karolinska Institutet) contains 12 consensus
Gli binding sites (36). HT29 cells were transiently transfected
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 4 mg Gli-luc and 0.4
mg pRLTK (renilla luciferase driven by TK promoter). Twentyfour hours posttransfection, cells were treated with GANT61
(20 mmol/L) for 36 hours, and harvested using the dual luciferase kit (Promega Corporation) according to the manufacturer's
protocol. Luciferase activity was detected by a Victor2 multilabel counter, and normalized to renilla luciferase activity as a
control for transfection efficiency.

Results
Western blot analysis
Total cellular lysates were prepared using RIPA lysis buffer
(Cell Signaling Technology). Protein (54 mg) was loaded and
separated on a 10% or 5% Tris-HCl gel. Proteins from the gel
were transferred on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and
subsequently blocked in blocking buffer [5% nonfat dry milk in
1 Tris Buffer Saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T)] for 1 hour.
Membranes were washed in 1 TBS-T and incubated with
primary antibody overnight at 4 C; they were subsequently
washed and incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 hour
after which they were developed using Super Signal Pico
substrate from Pierce Biotechnology.
RNA isolation and mRNA analysis
Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit
according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was
converted to cDNA using random primers (iScript Select
cDNA synthesis kit; BIO-RAD), and used for real-time mRNA
expression analysis using 40 cycles of Applied Biosystems 7500
Real-Time PCR instrumentation and software. Basal levels of
canonical HH signaling components were analyzed by 35
cycles of conventional PCR using the cDNA prepared as
described earlier in the text. Primers specific for each of
the signaling molecules were designed using NCBI/PrimerBLAST and used to generate the PCR products, subsequently
resolved and visualized on a 1% agarose gel. The following
primers were used:

Canonical HH pathway signaling components are
expressed in human colon carcinoma cell lines
We have shown that canonical HH signaling pathway
components, including the ligand, Shh, and the signaling
molecules Ptc, Smo, Gli1, and Gli2, are expressed in human
colon carcinoma cell lines, determined by RT-PCR (Fig. 1A) or
by Western analysis (Fig. 1B). Shh, Smo, and Gli1 were consistently expressed among the cell lines, whereas the levels of
both Ptc and Gli2 were more variable. Of interest, all the 6
human colon carcinoma cell lines expressed the secretory HH
ligand, Shh, shown by both RT-PCR and by Western analysis,
which supports the existence of an autocrine HH signaling
pathway in these cells, and is consistent with the known
transcriptional upregulation of HH ligands in gastrointestinal
malignancies (8).
Targeting Gli1 and Gli2 (GANT61) induced greater cell
death than targeting Smo (cyclopamine)
Previous studies have targeted Smo with cyclopamine, a
natural inhibitor, and have reported modest cytotoxicity in
human colon cancer cell models (13, 37). GANT61 has been
recently identified as a small molecule inhibitor of Gli1
transcriptional activity, which also abrogates Gli2-mediated
transcription (31). We compared the efficacy of both cyclopamine and GANT61 in the panel of 6 human colon cancer cell
lines. Cells were treated, in duplicate, with either cyclopamine
(20 mmol/L) or GANT61 (20 mmol/L) for up to 72 hours prior to
flow cytometric analysis to determine the extent of cell death
by Annexin V/PI staining, as described in Materials and
Methods. Cell death was initiated within 24 hours following
exposure to GANT61, but was maximally observed between 48
hours and 72 hours. In all cell lines except for HCT8, cell death
was more than 80% at 72 hours, and for HCT8, this was
approximately 60% (Fig. 2A). In contrast, cyclopamine induced

modest cytotoxicity in all cell lines examined, except for
SW480 (approximately 55% cell death; Fig. 2A) when administered at equimolar concentrations and for the same period of
time as GANT61. All cell lines responded to GANT61 treatment for 72 hours in a dose-dependent manner for a range of
concentrations (0–30 mmol/L; Fig. 2B), with 20 mmol/L achieving almost maximal cytotoxicity. Thus, GANT61 was further
employed in mechanistic studies.
GANT61 inhibited colony forming ability
Cells were treated, in triplicate, with increasing concentrations of GANT61 (0–20 mmol/L) for 72 hours, and clonogenic
survival determined (Fig. 3). HCT116, VRC5/c1, and GC3/c1
cells were sensitive at 10 mmol/L GANT61 (<10% clonogenic
survival), and almost no cell survival in all 6 colon carcinoma
cell lines following exposure to 20 mmol/L GANT61 (IC50:
5–15 mmol/L; Fig. 3).
GANT61 downregulates Gli1 and Gli2 expressions in
HT29 cells
The influence of GANT61 (20 mmol/L) on the expressions of
both Gli1 and Gli2 was subsequently determined by real-time
PCR in HT29 cells for up to 72 hours after treatment (Fig. 4A).
Gli2 expression was more rapidly decreased in comparison to
Gli1, with 50% decreased expression by 48 hours; Gli1 downregulation was approaching these levels by 72 hours. In
addition, Western analysis confirmed reduced expressions
of both Gli1 and Gli2 in HT29 cells by 72 hours after GANT61
treatment (Fig. 4B). In a third experiment, transient transfection of HT29 with a Gli-dependent luciferase reporter construct followed by exposure to GANT61 (0–20 mmol/L) for
36 hours showed a 50% decrease (at 20 mmol/L concentration)
in Gli-dependent luciferase reporter activity and hence

1096

Cancer Res; 71(3) February 1, 2011

reduced transcriptional activity of the Gli genes (Fig. 4C).
To confirm the Gli-dependent cytotoxic effects of GANT61, we
generated an HT29-derived stable cell line simultaneously
expressing Gli1shRNA and Gli2shRNA. Partial knockdown
of both Gli1 and Gli2 expressions resulted in partial (50% cell
death in GLI1shRNA þ Gli2shRNA compared with 80% in cell
death in scrambled shRNA) but significant (p < 0.0005)
protection from GANT61-induced cytotoxicity at 72 hours
posttreatment (Fig. 4D), supporting Gli-mediated cytotoxic
effects of GANT61 in human colon cancer cells.
GANT61 differentially regulates genes involved in the
balance between cell death and cell survival
HT29 cells were exposed to GANT61 (10 mmol/L, 20 mmol/
L) for 72 hours followed by Western analysis to determine the
expression of genes involved in the regulation of cell death
[PDGFRa, Fas, DR4, DR5 (DR5L, DR5S)] and cell survival
(Bcl-2), of which PDGFRa can be regulated by Gli1 (25),
and Bcl-2 is a direct transcriptional target of Gli2 (26).
Expression of PDGFRa was decreased following GANT61
treatment, with concomitant increase in Fas (Fig. 5A). No
increase in expression of the TRAIL receptor DR4 was
observed, in contrast to DR5 expression, in which the short
isoform of DR5, DR5S, was elevated. In contrast, Bcl-2 expression was decreased by GANT61 treatment. Cleavage of PARP
and activation of caspase-3, both markers of apoptosis, were
also increased after GANT61 exposure, correlating with the
change in expression of genes that regulate cell death (Fig. 5A).
Maximal effects on gene expression were obtained with
20 mmol/L GANT61 exposure, correlating with the extent of
cell death determined in Annexin V/PI staining and clonogenic survival assays. To genetically determine the effects of
Gli1 knockdown, Gli1 expression was inhibited in HT29 cells

using Gli1shRNA (Fig. 5B). Following Gli1 knockdown,
PDGFRa and Bcl-2 expressions were both decreased, whereas
Fas and DR5 expressions were simultaneously increased,
similar to the effects of GANT61 (Fig. 5B). Further, upregulation of DR5 by GANT61 (20 mmol/L) at the level of transcription was also shown at 48 hours after treatment (Fig. 5C). The
clonogenic cell survival of HT29 cells, stably expressing
Gli1shRNA, was reduced by approximately 60% compared
with scrambled shRNA expressing HT29 cells in the presence
of GANT61 (20 mmol/L; Fig. 5D).

Overexpression of DNFADD and Bcl-2 inhibit GANT61induced cell death
Since GANT61 induced the expressions of both Fas and the
short isoform of DR5, DR5S, signaling via both receptors at the
level of the adaptor molecule, FADD, was inhibited by transduction of DNFADD (33). HT29 cells stably transfected with
DNFADD were less sensitive to GANT61-induced cytotoxicity
(20 mmol/L, 72 hours; approximately 45% cell death).
Further, on overexpression of Bcl-2, HT29 cells were also
partially protected (approximately 50% cell death) from

HH signaling is required for colon cancer cell survival, such
that blocking active HH signaling with the pharmacologic
inhibitor cyclopamine (37) or shRNA, both targeting Smo,

carcinoma cell lines consistently express HH signaling components including Ptc, Smo, Gli1, Gli2, and, most importantly,

Figure 6. Overexpression of DNFADD and Bcl-2 inhibit GANT61-induced cell death. A, expression of DNFADD or overexpression of Bcl-2, or simultaneous
expression of both DNFADD and Bcl-2, in HT29 cells, impart partial protection against GANT61-induced cell death. HT29 cells were stably transduced with
either DNFADD or Bcl-2, as described in Materials and Methods. HT29 cells expressing Bcl-2 were further transduced with DNFADD to generate dual
expression of both Bcl-2 and DNFADD. Cells were treated with GANT61 (20 mmol/L) for 72 hours and cell death determined by Annexin V FITC/PI staining and
FACS analysis. Data represent the mean  SD of 3 determinations. B, expression of Bcl-2 and DNFADD was confirmed by Western analysis. DNFADD is a

the ligand, Shh, suggesting an autocrine mode of HH signaling
in these cells. Activation of the HH signaling cascade consistently induces Gli1 transcription (42), hence Gli1 mRNA and
protein expression, expressed in all cell lines in this study, is
indicative of active HH signaling.
To identify new therapeutic targets, inhibition of HH signaling has been attempted in various human cancer models
including basal cell carcinoma (27), prostate cancer (11),
rhabdomyosarcoma (40), and pancreatic cancer (43). Historically, Smo antagonists have been used to abrogate HH signaling in human cancers with moderate success (40). Natural and
synthetic pharmacologic agents including cyclopamine (11)
and GDC-0449, respectively, have inhibited survival and antitumor functions in preclinical models of human cancers
whereas GDC-0449 has recently obtained responses in one
medulloblastoma (44) and certain basal cell carcinomas in
patients (45). However, various levels of resistance have been
observed with each of the clinical trials that have been
performed. These observations highlight the need for identifying better therapeutic targets that will effectively block HH
signaling. One potential druggable target lies in the family of
Gli transcription factors, Gli1 and Gli2, which are the final
arbiters of transcriptional regulation in the HH signaling
pathway.
A recent study identified a small molecule inhibitor,
GANT61, which effectively blocked Gli1 DNA-binding and
transcriptional activity, and also interrupted Gli2 activator
functions (31). In the context of colon cancer, previous
attempts to block HH signaling at the level of Smo, induced
only moderate cytotoxicity in these cells (37). In contrast,
exposure to GANT61 induces significant cytotoxicity in
human colon cancer cells, (60%–90% cell death), which is

greater than that induced by exposure to cyclopamine at
equimolar concentrations and equivalent durations. This
finding suggests that direct targeting of the Gli transcription
factors, rather than Smo, upstream of Gli1 and Gli2, is more
efficient in inducing cytotoxicity in colon cancer cells (Fig. 2).
Recent studies in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma show
Smo-independent activation of Gli proteins that are dependent on TGF-b and KRAS signaling (46). Although comprehensive data are lacking, it has been suggested that oncogenic
signals such as KRAS may affect HH signaling, because both
aberrant activation of HH signaling and RAS mutations are
found in colon cancers (reviewed in ref. 47).
GANT61 treatment decreased constitutive Gli1 and Gli2
mRNA and protein expression and Gli-luciferase reporter
activity in the human colon carcinoma cell line, HT29,
consistent with previous observations in HEK293 cells engineered to express Gli1 (31). Of particular interest, GANT61
treatment of human colon carcinoma cell lines markedly
reduced their colony forming ability by more than 90%,
thereby showing potential for therapeutic application. It
was previously reported that GANT61 was identified as an
inhibitor of Gli1 transcriptional activity, and also abrogated
Gli2-mediated transcription (31). Subsequently, we have
observed that reduction in Gli2 mRNA and protein expression preceded that of Gli1 in human colon carcinoma cells.
Further, Gli2 is known to transcriptionally regulate Gli1
expression (8, 18–20). Because the HH signaling pathway
is already activated in human colon carcinoma cell lines,
studies using shRNA knockdown of both Gli1 and Gli2 were
conducted. Because HH signaling is critical to cellular
survival, complete knockdown of the Gli genes could not
be obtained. However, stable expressions of Gli1shRNA and

Gli2shRNA, and partial knockdown of Gli1 and Gli2, in HT29
cells, conferred partial but significant protection from
GANT61-induced cytotoxicity. These data further support
the Gli-specific mode of action of GANT61, and further show
the importance of functional Gli genes in maintaining cellular survival in human colon carcinoma cells.
We characterized the molecular mechanisms of GANT61induced cell death in HT29 cells. Exposure to GANT61 resulted
in caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage, characteristic of
apoptotic cell death (48). We also determined the contributions of both the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic and death
receptor signaling–mediated extrinsic apoptotic cell death
pathways, based on the known regulation of PDGFRa
upstream of Fas (24), and of Bcl-2, which may be a direct
transcriptional target of both Gli1 and Gli2, in HH-dependent
cell survival (26). We have shown that GANT61 treatment
reduces Bcl-2 expression and overexpression of Bcl-2 partially
rescues from GANT61-induced cytotoxicity in HT29 cells
(Fig. 7). These observations underscore the important role
of Bcl-2 in contributing to HH-dependent colon cancer cell
survival.
A second important cell death signaling mechanism is
mediated by the death receptor signaling pathway. Death
receptors are cell surface proteins that belong to the TNF
family (reviewed in ref. 49). These receptors contain an 80
amino acid long cytoplasmic region, the death domain, which
interacts with the death domains of adaptor molecules that in
turn transduce cell death signals (49). The specific death
receptors, Fas (29) and DR5 (50), are expressed in colon
cancers. Exposure to GANT61 induced a marked increase
in the expression levels of both Fas and the short isoform
of DR5, DR5S, but not TRAIL receptor DR4, suggesting the
potential involvement of Fas and DR5 in GANT61-induced
cytotoxicity. The regulation of DR5 expression by the Gli genes
is currently unknown and may be via an indirect mechanism,
because no Gli binding sites can be identified in the promoter
region of DR5. However, GANT61 induced upregulation of DR5
mRNA in HT29 cells, suggesting transcriptional regulation of
DR5 by a currently unknown mechanism. The adaptor molecule FADD is a critical component of death receptor signaling,
and functions downstream of both the death receptors Fas
and DR5. Thus, we inhibited the function of FADD with
DNFADD, which would inhibit death receptor signaling downstream of the receptor complex. Data show that DNFADD had
a protective effect from GANT61-induced cell death in HT29
cells, confirming the importance of suppression of the death
receptor signaling pathway in HH-dependent colon cancer cell
survival. GANT61-elicited cytotoxicity in human colon cancer
cells may be mediated by multiple mechanisms such as cell
cycle checkpoints, DNA damage response and autophagy and
are currently under investigation.
This work has defined two molecular determinants of cell
death following the inhibition of HH signaling by GANT61 in
human colon cancer cells that include a functional death
receptor signaling pathway, and suppression of Bcl-2 expression. Inhibition of Gli1 expression and function in HT29
cells using RNA interference technology mimicked the effects
of GANT61 administration, supporting the specificity of

Figure 7. Schematic representation of the inhibition of HH signaling and
genes involved in the balance between cell survival and cell death.
Activated Gli1 and Gli2, downstream of Shh-Ptc-Smo, regulate targets of
HH signaling including Bcl-2, PDGFRa, Fas, and DR5. GANT61 (targeting
Gli) blocks the direct functions of Gli activators, resulting in greater cell
death than that induced by cyclopamine, which targets Smo.

GANT61. Collectively (see schema in Fig. 7), this study shows
the significance of HH signaling to cellular survival via activation of Gli1 and Gli2 in human colon carcinoma cells. Activated
Gli proteins regulate downstream targets of HH signaling,
including Bcl-2, PDGFRa, Fas, and DR5. In the presence of
GANT61 (targeting Gli) the functions of Gli activators are
inhibited; PDGFRa and Bcl-2 are downregulated, whereas
Fas and DR5 are upregulated. GANT61 induces significant cell
death, whereas targeting Smo with cyclopamine is less effective
at inducing cytotoxicity. These findings underscore the critical
role of HH signaling in human colon cancer cells and the
possibility of targeting Gli1 and Gli2 activator functions using
GANT61 in this disease.
