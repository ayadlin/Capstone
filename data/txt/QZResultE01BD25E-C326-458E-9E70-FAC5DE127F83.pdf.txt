ABSTRACT
Breast-cancer is heterogeneous and consists of various groups with different
biological characteristics. Innovative pharmacological approaches accounting for this
heterogeneity are needed. The forty eight human Nuclear-Hormone-Receptors are
ligand-dependent transcription-factors and are classified into Endocrine-Receptors,
Adopted-Orphan-Receptors (Lipid-sensors and Enigmatic-Orphans) and Orphanreceptors. Nuclear-Receptors represent ideal targets for the design/synthesis of
pharmacological ligands. We provide an overview of the literature available on
the expression and potential role played by Lipid-sensors, Enigmatic-Orphans and
Orphan-Receptors in breast-cancer. The data are complemented by an analysis of
the expression levels of each selected Nuclear-Receptor in the PAM50 breast-cancer
groups, following re-elaboration of the data publicly available. The major aim is to
support the idea that some of the Nuclear-Receptors represent largely unexploited
therapeutic-targets in breast-cancer treatment/chemo-prevention. On the basis of
our analysis, we conclude that the Lipid-Sensors, NR1C3, NR1H2 and NR1H3 are
likely to be onco-suppressors in breast-cancer. The Enigmatic-Orphans, NR1F1 NR2A1
and NR3B3 as well as the Orphan-Receptors, NR0B1, NR0B2, NR1D1, NR2F1, NR2F2
and NR4A3 exert a similar action. These Nuclear-Receptors represent candidates
for the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at increasing their expression
or activating them in tumor cells. The group of Nuclear-Receptors endowed with
potential oncogenic properties consists of the Lipid-Sensors, NR1C2 and NR1I2, the
Enigmatic-Orphans, NR1F3, NR3B1 and NR5A2, as well as the Orphan-Receptors,
NR2E1, NR2E3 and NR6A1. These oncogenic Nuclear-Receptors should be targeted
with selective antagonists, reverse-agonists or agents/strategies capable of reducing
their expression in breast-cancer cells.

each having different biological characteristics and drugsensitivity [1]. A more recent classification further split
PAM50 Basal cancer into Basal-like and Claudin-low
tumors (Figure 1).
The superfamily of human Nuclear-HormoneReceptors (NRs) consists of forty eight members, which
are ligand-dependent transcription-factors controlling
the expression of specific gene-sets [2]. However, this is
unlikely to represent their sole function, as transcriptionindependent activities are known for various NRs. NRs
are encoded by distinct genes which, in many cases, give
rise to different splicing-/protein-variants (Tables 1, 2,
3). The amino-acid sequences of human NRs are highly

Breast-cancer is heterogeneous and traditionally
classified according to the expression of EstrogenReceptor-alpha (NR3A1/ERα), Progesterone-Receptor
(NR3C3/PR) and/or HER2, the ERBB2 gene product.
With these markers, breast-cancer is subdivided into
ER-positive (ER+), HER2-positive (HER2+) and triplenegative tumors. Genomic/transcriptomic data indicate
that the number of breast-cancer groups is larger than
originally assumed. The PAM50 gene-expression
fingerprint classifies mammary-tumors in five groups,
Basal, Her2, Luminal-A, Luminal-B and Normal-like,

Heterodimeric-Receptors.
Steroid-Receptors
include Estrogen-Receptor-α (NR3A1/ERα) and
Estrogen-Receptor-β (NR3A2/ERβ), ProgesteroneReceptor (NR3C3/PR), Androgen-Receptor (NR3C4/
AR), Mineralcorticoid-Receptor (NR3C2/MR) and
Glucocorticod-Receptor (NR3C1/GR). The VitaminD-Receptor (NR1I1/VDR), Thyroid-Receptor-alpha
(NR1A1/TRα), Thyroid-Receptor-beta (NR1A2/TRβ),
Retinoic-Acid-Receptor-alpha (NR1B1/RARα), RetinoicAcid-Receptor-beta (NR1B2/RARβ) and Retinoic-AcidReceptor-gamma (NR1B3/RARγ) are HeterodimericReceptors. Adopted-Orphan-Receptors are split into
Lipid-sensors and Enigmatic-Orphans.
Innovative pharmacological approaches taking into
account the heterogeneity of breast cancer are needed.
NRs represent ideal targets for the design/synthesis
of pharmacological ligands. Indeed, the E-region

similar (Figure 2A) and contain up to six conserved
structural regions (Figure 2B). The N-terminal A- and
B-regions are responsible for the ligand-independent
transcriptional-activation-function (AF-1). The C-region
contains the DNA-binding domain, while the D-region is
unstructured. The E-region contains the ligand-bindingdomain and is responsible for the ligand-dependent
transcriptional-activation-function (AF-2). The function
of the C-terminal ill-conserved F-region is undefined.
As the C- and E-regions are particularly important and
structurally conserved, their position in NRs is indicated
in Tables 1, 2, 3.
Human NRs are classified into EndocrineReceptors, Adopted-Orphan-Receptors and Orphanreceptors according to the presence/absence of
identified endogenous-ligands [3] (Tables 1, 2, 3).
Endocrine-Receptors are divided into Steroid-Receptors

an overview of the literature available on the expression
and role played by Lipid-sensors, Enigmatic-Orphans

are complemented by an analysis of the expression levels
of each NR in the PAM50 breast-cancer groups, following
re-elaboration of the data in the TCGA site (The-CancerGenome-Atlas:

represent unexploited therapeutic-targets in breast-cancer

acid, induces apoptosis in ER+/ and ER-/breast-cancer cells
and this effect is potentiated by RXR-selective ligands
[9]. NR1C1 onco-suppressive action may involve breastcancer stromal components. Indeed, NR1C1-activation
in mammary-tumor cells suppresses Hypoxia-InducibleFactor-1-α signaling, reduces Vascular-EndothelialGrowth-Factor secretion and tube formation by
endothelial cells, suggesting anti-angiogenic effects [10].
NR1C1 anti-tumor activity may be of particular relevance
in ER+/breast-cancer, since anti-estrogens induce NR1C1mRNA in ER+/MCF-7 cells and ERα over-expression into
ER-/MDA-MB-231 cells decreases NR1C1-mRNA [11].
In ER+/MCF-7 and ER+/T47D breast-cancer cells,
NR1C2-activation by GW501516 stimulates proliferation

and angiogenic responses [10]. In addition, the NR1C2antagonist, SR13904, inhibits cell-growth and -survival
[12]. Two NR1C2-inverse-agonists (ST247 = methyl
3-(N-(4-(hexylamino)-2-methoxyphenyl)sulfamoyl)
thiophene-2-carboxylate and DG172 = (Z)-2-(2bromophenyl)-3-(4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl)
acrylonitrile dihydrochloride) inhibit serum- and TGFβinduced invasion of ER-/MDA-MB231 cells into threedimensional matrixes, suggesting that NR1C2 favors
tumor-cell dissemination [13]. A role in ST247/DG172
action is played by Angiopoietin-Like-4 down-regulation.
NR1C2 oncogenic action is supported by data obtained
in MMTV-PPARβ/δ transgenic-models of mammary
carcinogenesis where the NR1C2-agonist, GW501516,
42668

Oncotarget

reduces tumor latency [14]. Further support comes from
transgenic-mice over-expressing 3-PhosphoinositideDependent-Kinase-1, a protein regulated by NR1C2,
where GW501516 accelerates tumorigenesis [15].
NR1C2 oncogenic action may involve the EGFR/ERBB2
pathway via FABP5 (Fatty-Acid-Binding-Protein-5),
which delivers ligands to NR1C2. In ER+/MCF-7 cells,
EGFR/ERBB2-dependent proliferative responses are
accompanied by FABP5 induction [16]. In MMTV-ErbB2/
HER2 mice, spontaneously developing breast-cancer,
FABP5 ablation relieves activation of EGFR downstream
signals, down-regulates NR1C2 target-genes involved
in cell-proliferation and suppresses tumor-growth [17].
The retinoid pathway may also be involved in NR1C2
oncogenic activity, as NR1C2 is bound/activated by
ATRA [18]. Indeed, ATRA delivery to NR1C2 and RARs
is dependent on FABP5 and CRABP-II, respectively. In
ATRA-resistant MMTV-neu transgenic-model of breastcancer, decreasing FABP5/CRABP-II ratio diverts ATRA
from NR1C2 to RAR and suppresses tumor-growth [19].
Although all this is consistent with an oncogenic action
of NR1C2 in breast-cancer, there is also evidence to the
contrary. The NR1C2-agonist, GW501516, inhibits MCF7 cells growth [20] and NR1C2 over-expression/activation
reduces clonogenicity and in-vivo growth of ER+/MCF7 and ER-/MDA-MB231 cells [21]. In conclusion, the
majority of the available data indicates that NR1C2 is prooncogenic in breast-carcinoma [22].
NR1C3 levels are associated with improved
clinical outcome and represent a prognostic factor for
overall-survival in ER+/breast-cancer patients, suggesting
onco-suppressive properties [23]. The synthetic NR1C3agonists, thiazolidinediones, suppress mammary-tumor
growth in-vitro and in-vivo [24-26]. Thiazolidinedioneactivated NR1C3 interferes with ERα, Signal-Transducerand-Activator-of-Transcription-5B and Nucler-FactorkappaB, inhibiting the proliferation of ER+/ and ER-/cells
which undergo differentiation [27] and apoptosis [28].
In addition, thiazolidinediones inhibit TGFβ signaling,
which suppresses breast-cancer early-development
[25]. Finally, NR1C3-agonists reduce mammary-tumor
angiogenesis and invasion [29]. In rats, the NR1C3ligand, GW7845, inhibits carcinogen-induced breastcancer [26]. Troglitazone prevents 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)
anthracene-induced transformation of murine breast-tissue
[30] and NR1C3 heterozygous-deletion causes greater
susceptibility to mammary-tumor development after
exposure to the same anthracene-related compound [31].
The action of NR1C3 stimulation is not limited to breastcancer prevention and extends to treatment [32]. The only
exception to the in-vivo data supporting NR1C3 oncosuppressive properties is represented by a study showing
that the NR acts as a tumor-promoter in a transgenicmodel of breast carcinogenesis via interference with the
WNT-pathway [33]. A small-sized clinical-trial reports
that patients with metastatic breast-cancer fail to show any
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

benefit from troglitazone administration [34]. An equally
small and recent trial demonstrates that administration of
rosiglitazone between the time of diagnostic biopsy and
definitive surgery is well-tolerated although it does not
alter breast-cancer cell-proliferation [35].

NR1H2 (LXRβ:liver-X-receptor-β) and NR1H3
(LXRα:liver-X-receptor-α)
NR1H2 and NR1H3 are involved in the metabolism/
homeostasis of cholesterol/lipids/bile-acids/steroidhormones and modulate innate immunity [36]. NR1H2
and NR1H3 are activated by oxysterols, like 27-hydroxycholesterol (Table 1). There is cross-talk between NR1H2/
NR1H3 and NR1H4/NR1F1, as NR1H4 activation downregulates NR1H3, while NR1H3 and NR1F1 antagonize
each other in terms of transcriptional activity [36, 37].
NR1H2 (UNIGENE-Hs.432976) and NR1H3 (UNIGENEHs.438863) mRNA expression is ubiquitous. The largest
amounts of NR1H3 mRNA are observed in adipose-tissue.
According to the TCGA dataset, normal mammary-glands
contain high NR1H2 and NR1H3 mRNA levels (Figure
3). No difference in NR1H2 expression is observed among
the PAM50 groups of breast-cancer and normal tissue. By
contrast, NR1H3 is down-regulated in all PAM50 tumor
groups relative to the normal mammary-gland.
As for the potential role of NR1H2 and NR1H3 in
breast-cancer, little and contrasting evidence is available.
NR1H2/NR1H3 ligands secreted by tumor cells inhibit
CCR7 expression on maturing dendritic cells, impairing
immune-surveillance and favoring tumor growth [38].
In mouse breast-cancer models, 27-hydroxycholesterol
augments ER-dependent mammary-tumor growth
and increases NR1H2/NR1H3-dependent metastasis
[39]. The two effects require conversion of cholesterol
into 27-hydroxycholesterol by CYP27A1 [40]. The
data obtained in these mouse models contrast with
the observations made in some breast-cancer cells,
where NR1H2/NR1H3 activation reduces proliferation
with down-regulation of genes involved in cell cycle
progression, DNA replication and other cell-growthrelated processes [41, 42]. In ER+/breast-tumors the
NR1H2/NR1H3 growth-inhibitory action may result from
systemic effects, as the two NRs control hepatic estrogen
biosynthesis. In the liver, NR1H2/NR1H3 stimulation
results in sulfotransferase (an enzyme critical for estrogen
deactivation) induction which inhibits breast-cancer
growth in xenografted mice [43]. Non-cell autonomous
growth-inhibitory effects are also suggested by in-vitro
results, as culture medium from NR1H2/NR1H3 activated
macrophages causes growth-inhibition and apoptosis of
breast-cancer cells [44].
In conclusion, NR1H2/NR1H3 activation may
represent a strategy for the treatment/chemoprevention of
breast-cancer, although caution should be exercised, since
42669

Oncotarget

NR1I2-mRNA is down-regulated in Her2 tumors, while
the opposite is true in Basal tumors (Figure 3). The
TCGA data on the expression of the NR1I2 transcript
in the PAM50 breast cancer subtypes are only partially
in line with the reported inverse relationship between
NR1I2-mRNA expression and ER-positivity [55]. NR1I2
represents a negative prognostic marker in breast-cancer,
as NR1I2-protein levels correlate with labeling-index,
histologic-grade and lymph-node-status [56]. In addition,
NR1I2-protein over-expression and nuclear localization
is associated with infiltrative-carcinoma recurrence [56].
NR1I2 plays a role in breast-cancer cell resistance to antitumor agents. In ER+/MCF-7 cells, NR1I2 is involved
in induced resistance to tamoxifene via up-regulation of
Multidrug-Resistance-Associated-protein-2, a membranetransporter controlling drug efflux [57]. In ER+/MCF-7
and ER-/MDA-MB231 cells, SR12813 causes docetaxel
resistance and induction of the drug-resistance genes,
Multidrug-Resistance-1 and Breast-cancer-ResistanceProtein B [58]. Thus, NR1I2-inhibition should be
considered in the treatment of tumors with acquired
resistance to anti-hormones and chemotherapy.

NR1H2/NR1H3-agonists may favor the metastatic spread
of tumor cells [39].

NR1H4 (FXR:farnesoid-X-receptor)
NR1H4 transcriptional activity is stimulated by bileacids, such as chenodeoxycholic acid [45, 46]. Adrenalglands, kidney, liver and intestine express the highest
NR1H4-mRNA levels (UNIGENE-Hs.282735), although
the transcript is present also in mammary-glands. With the
exception of the Normal-like group, all PAM50 mammarytumor sub-types express smaller NR1H4 amounts than the
normal counterpart (Figure 3). In breast-cancer, NR1H4protein levels are associated with ER-status and luminal
markers [47].
Data on the role played by NR1H4 in mammarytumors are contrasting. As bile-acids are a risk factor
for post-menopausal breast-cancer [48], their high
concentrations in breast-cysts/plasma of mammarytumor patients [49] suggest a role for NR1H4 in disease
induction/progression. Consistent with this hypothesis,
the NR1H4 agonist, deoxycholate, promotes survival
and favors migration of ER-/MDA-MB-231 cells, while
the inverse-agonist, guggulsterone, exerts opposite
effects [50]. Similarly, farnesol, another NR1H4-agonist,
exerts mitogenic effects in ER+/MCF-7 cells, but not in
ER-/MDA-MB231 cells [47]. Mitogenesis may require
binding/activation of ERα by NR1H4 [47]. NR1H4dependent proliferation of ER+/breast-cancer cells is
stimulated by estrogen deprivation, which recapitulates
menopause and aromatase-inhibitor treatment [47]. In
spite of the evidence indicating that NR1H4 is oncogenic,
particularly in ER+/breast-cancer, there is also evidence
supporting the idea that NR1H4-activation is antioncogenic. High concentrations of the GW4064 agonist
induce apoptosis of ER+/MCF-7 and ER-/MDA-MB468
cells [51]. Chenodeoxycholic-acid and GW4064 inhibit
growth of tamoxifen-resistant ER+/cells. Interestingly,
chenodeoxycholic-acid reduces EGF-induced growth
of these cells via inhibition of the HER2 pathway [52].
On the basis of these data, it is currently difficult to
establish whether NR1H4 is endowed with oncogenic
or onco-suppressive properties in breast cancer and
whether targeted therapeutic strategies should be aimed at
inhibiting or activating the receptor.

ENIGMATIC-ORPHANS
The family of Enigmatic-orphans contains NRs
whose endogenous ligands are ill-defined or unknown and
consists of eleven members.

NR1F1 (RORα:RAR-related-orphan-receptor-α),
NR1F2 (RORβ:RAR-related-orphan-receptor-β)
and
NR1F3
(ROR:RAR-related-orphanreceptor-γ)
NR1F1, NR1F2 and NR1F3 control circadian
rhythms [59]. NR1F2 plays also a role in lineage
specification of CD4+ T-helper into Th17 cells [60].
NR1F1, NR1F2 and NRF3 bind to the regulatory
regions of target-genes (ROR-Response-Elements) as
monomers [61]. ATRA and melatonin are endogenous
NR1F1-agonists, while 7β,27-dihydroxycholesterol is
an endogenous NR1F3-ligand (Table 3). Only synthetic
agonists/antagonists targeting NR1F1 and NR1F3
are available. The highest NR1F1-mRNA levels are
observed in skin, muscle and adrenal-glands (UNIGENEHs.560343), while NR1F2-mRNA expression is restricted
to eyes and adrenal-glands (UNIGENE-Hs.494178) and
NR1F3-mRNA is ubiquitous (UNIGENE-Hs.256022).
NR1F1 and NR1F3 are expressed in the mammarygland, while NRF2 is under-represented in the organ.
All PAM50-classified breast-cancer types express lower
NR1F1-mRNA levels than the normal tissue (Figure 4).
Luminal-A and Normal-like tumors presents with the
largest NR1F1 amounts. Similarly, NR1F2 is downregulated in most cancer subgroups relative to the normal

NR1I2 (PXR:pregnane-X-receptor)
NR1I2 plays a role in xenobiotic metabolism
and is activated by various synthetic ligands (Table 1)
[53]. NR1I2 regulates the expression of genes involved
in xenobiotic metabolism and transport [54]. NR1I2mRNA highest levels are observed in liver although
considerable amounts are measurable also in mammaryglands (UNIGENE-Hs.7303). Relative to normal tissue,

tissue. Basal tumors are the poorest NR1F2 source. Unlike
NR1F1 and NR1F2, larger NR1F3-mRNA amounts are
present in mammary-tumors than in normal glands.
NR1F1 is a growth stimulator in ER+/cells, while
it is an inhibitor in ER-/cells [62]. NR1F1 may stimulate
ER+/cell-growth via ERα binding/activation or aromatase
induction [63]. Besides inhibiting growth, NR1F1 exerts
anti-invasive actions in ER-/cells and tumors [64-66]. In
ER-/cells and xenografts, transcriptional Semaphorin3F induction via a ROR-Response-Element contributes
to NR1F1 anti-invasive and growth-inhibitory activities
[64]. In addition, NR1F1 binds E2F1-transcriptionfactor, inhibits E2F1-acetylation and transcriptional
activity, reducing ductal epithelial-cell proliferation [66].
No studies on NR1F2 in breast-cancer are available and
the number of publications involving NR1F3 is limited
[64, 67, 68]. High NR1F3 expression is associated with
an increase in metastasis-free survival [67]. It is also
possible that NR1F3 expression enhances mammarytumors aggressiveness reducing T-lymphocytes immunesurveillance [64]. In conclusion, NRF1 induction/
activation and NRF13 suppression/inhibition may be of
therapeutic use, particularly in ER-/breast-cancer

NR2A1 [75] and it is bound/activated by endogenous
fatty-acids, which are difficult to replace with synthetic
molecules [76]. NR2A1-mRNA expression is restricted
to liver, kidney, small intestine and stomach (UNIGENEHs.116462), while NR2A2-mRNA is present in kidney,
stomach and muscle (UNIGENE-Hs.241529). Very small
NR2A1 and NR2A2 mRNA amounts are detectable in
mammary-glands. NR2A1 levels are slightly higher in
Luminal-A and Luminal-B cancers relative to normal tissue
(Figure 4). Her2 tumors contain the smallest NR2A2
amounts. In mammary-glands, NR2A1 has been the object
of few studies [77-81], while no studies on NR2A2 are
available. NR2A1 may have oncosuppressive properties
[77], as it is down-regulated in mammary epithelial-cells
undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).

NR3B1
(ERRα:estrogen-related-receptor-α),
NR3B2 (ERRβ: estrogen-related-receptor-β) and
NR3B3 (ERRγ:estrogen-related-receptor-γ)
NR3B1, NR1B2 and NRB3 show structural
similarity with ERs [82]. Diethylstilbestrol is a nonselective endogenous NR3B-agonist (Table 2). NR3Bs
bind to ERRE (Estrogen-Related-Response-Elements)
in target-genes. Although it was originally thought
that NR3Bs and ERα control common target-genes, a
recent study demonstrates that NR3B1 and ERα share
only a minor fraction of targets [83]. NR3B1-mRNA
(UNIGENE-Hs.110849) and NRB3-mRNA (UNIGENEHs.444225) are ubiquitously expressed, while NRB2mRNA expression is restricted (eye and muscle;
UNIGENE-Hs.435845). NR3B1 regulates circadianclocks, influencing metabolic homeostasis and locomotoractivity [84-86].
In mammary-glands, NR3B1 and NR3B2 are highly
expressed, while NR3B3 levels are negligible (Figure
4). Normal tissues and all PAM50-classified breastcancers express similar amounts of NR3B2-mRNA and
NR3B3-mRNA. By converse, HER2-like and Basal-like
mammary-tumors contain larger NR3B1-mRNA amounts
than the normal tissue, which is consistent with a positive
correlation between NR3B1 and HER2 expression [87].
In line with this, HER2/MAPK/AKT activation causes
NR3B1 phosphorylation/activation in HER2+/BT474
cells [88]. In addition, NR3B1 activates transcription of
the genes contained in the ERBB2 amplicon observed in
the majority of HER2+ breast tumors, possibly explaining
the delay in tumor development observed following
NR3b1 knock-out in a mouse model of ERBB2-initiated
mammary cancerogenesis [89]. NR3B1 is a negative
prognostic factor for breast-tumors, being associated with
increased recurrence-risk and adverse clinical-outcome
[90]. Consistent with NR3B1 oncogenic action, NR3B1antagonists reduce the size of ER+/ and ER-/xenografts
[91], while NR3B1 knock-down diminishes in-vitro

NR1I3 (CAR:constitutive-androstane-receptor)
NR1I3 is characterized by a large number of
protein variants (Table 2). NR1I3 high basal activity is
inhibited by steroids related to androstenol [69] and is
involved in drug-metabolism and energy-homeostasis
[70]. NR1I3 and NR1I2 control an overlapping set
of genes and their physiological function seems to
be redundant, although NR1I3 plays a unique role in
bilirubin clearance [71]. NR1I3 is activated by 4-bis[2(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP) directly
or indirectly by phenobarbital via cytoplasm-to-nucleus
translocation [72]. The only known synthetic NR1I3agonist is (4-chlorophenyl)imidazo[2,1-b][1,3]thiazole5-carbaldehyde-O-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)oxime (CITCO),
while various synthetic NR1I3-inhibitors are available.
NR1I3-mRNA expression is limited to liver and kidney
(UNIGENE-Hs.349642) and very low NR1I3-mRNA
levels are detectable in the mammary-gland. NR1I3 is upregulated in all mammary-tumor sub-types, with the sole
exception of Normal-like cancer (Figure 4). There are no
studies on NR1I3 in breast cancer indicating whether it
could be oncogenic or not.

NR2A1(HNF4α:hepatocyte-nuclear-factor-4α)
and NR2A2 (HNF4γ:hepatocyte-nuclear-factor-4)
NR2A1 binds as a homodimer to target genes
[73] and its transcriptional activity may be regulated by
endogenous ligands such as linoleic acid [74]. NR2A2
interacts with the same DNA target-sites recognized by

migration and in-vivo growth of ER-/MDA-MB-231 cells
[91]. The pathways underlying NR3B1 pro-oncogenic
action are obscure and may vary in ER+/ and HER2+/
tumors. WNT inhibitors suppress NR3B1 transcriptional
activity via β-catenin [92], reducing breast-cancer cells
migration. In contrast, NR3B1-activation stimulates
Vascular-Endothelial-Growth-Factor production and
angiogenesis [93]. In ER+/breast-cancer cells, NR3B1
increases estrogen synthesis via aromatase induction
[94]. As local synthesis of estrogens is fundamental
for the growth of post-menopausal ER+/breast-cancer,
NR3B1 inhibition may represent a therapeutic strategy
in these patients. In breast-cancer, single study indicates
that NR3B2 is a potential tumor-suppressor [95], while
the potential tumor-suppressive activity of NR3B3 is
supported by more studies [82, 96, 97]. NR3B3suppresses
breast tumor growth and reverses the process of epithelialto-mesenchymal transition [97].
In summary, while NR3B1 suppression/inhibition is
likely to be of therapeutic value in Her2, Basal and postmenopausal or tamoxifen resistant ER+/tumors, activation
or induction of NR3B3 may represent a viable therapeutic
strategy in ER-/tumors.

[99]. In ER+/ and ER- /breast-cancer cells, NR5A2 is a
mitogen and this action may involve NR5A2-dependent
stimulation of Growth-Regulation-by-Estrogen-in-Breastcancer-1 (GREB-1) transcription [102]. In ER+/MCF-7
and ER-/MDA-MB231 cells, NR5A2 increases motility, a
key process in metastatic spread [103]. Finally, NR5A2
may represent a negative prognostic marker, as a targetgenes signature is associated with poor outcome in highgrade mammary-tumors [104]. Thus, NR5A2 is likely to
be an oncogene and reduction of NR5A2-antagonists may
produce anti-tumor effects.

ORPHAN RECEPTORS
The fifteen members of the Orphan-receptors family
are NRs for which endogenous-ligands are not identified.
The sole exceptions are represented by NR1D1, NR1D2
and NR4A3 for which two endogenous-agonists are
hypothesized.

NR0B1(DAX-1:dosage-sensitive-sex-reversaladrenal-hypoplasia-critical-region-onchromosome-X-gene-1) and NR0B2 (SHP:smallheterodimeric-partner)

NR5A1 (SF-1:steroidogenic-factor-1) and NR5A2
(LRH-1:liver-receptor-homolog-1)

NR0B1 and NR0B2 are devoid of DNA-binding
domains and act as co-repressor/co-activator of NR1Bs/
RARs, NR2Bs/RXRs, NR1Cs, NR1Hs and NR1H4 [105,
106]. NR0B1 plays a role in adrenal-cortex development
and puberty onset, while NR0B2 controls various aspects
of cell metabolism. NR0B1 expression is restricted
to adrenal-glands, lung and pancreas (UNIGENEHs.268490), while NR0B2 mRNA is measurable in
liver, stomach, heart, lung and intestine (UNIGENEHs.427055). Mammary-glands contain low NR0B1mRNA and NR0B2-mRNA levels and NR0B1-mRNA is
down-regulated in all PAM50 breast-cancer types (Figure
5). NR0B1 is associated with ERα, PR and AR expression
[107] and is a positive prognostic factor in node-negative
breast-cancer, being correlated with smaller tumor-size,
earlier disease-stage and increased survival [106, 107].
NR0B1 is induced by AR-activation in ER+/MCF-7 breastcancer cells and this causes aromatase down-regulation.
The effect may underlay AR-ligands anti-estrogenic
action. NR0B1 over-expression induces growth-inhibitory
and apoptotic responses in MCF-7 cells [108]. NR0B2
activation by CD437 exerts pro-apoptotic actions in ER-/
MDA-MB-468 breast-cancer cells via transcriptional
mechanisms [109]. However, NR0B2 triggers apoptosis
also via BCL-2 binding in mitochondria [109]. In
conclusion, NR0B1 and NR0B2 are endowed with oncosuppressive properties in breast-cancer.

NR5A1 controls the expression of genes involved
in cortisol/corticosterone biosynthesis [98], while
NR5A2 play a role in hepatic bile-acids-metabolism,
cholesterol-transport and glucose-homeostasis [99].
It is still unresolved whether NR5A1 is activated by
endogenous ligands, as its transcriptional activity is
stimulated by phosphorylation and by interactions
with other proteins [98]. Nevertheless, NR5A1 and
NR5A2 bind phospholipids, like phosphatidic-acid and
phosphatidyl-choline. In addition, synthetic NR5A1/
NR5A2 agonists/antagonists are available (Table 2). Large
NR5A-mRNA amounts are expressed in adrenal-glands
and testis (UNIGENE-Hs.495108), while the richest
sources of NR5A2 are pancreas, adrenal-glands and liver
(UNIGENE-Hs.33446).
In normal mammary-glands, NR5A2 levels are
much higher than NR5A1 levels. Basal cancer overexpresses NR5A1 relative to the other tumor subtypes
and normal tissue. In contrast NR5A2-mRNA is downregulated in all breast-tumors, regardless of the PAM50
classification (Figure 4). The strongest NR5A2-mRNA
expression is observed in Luminal-A Luminal-B and
Normal-like which may be consistent with NR5A2-gene
control by ERα [99-101].
NR5A1 has never been the object of studies in
breast-cancer while data on NR5A2 are available. NR5A2
knock-down inhibits estrogens proliferative action in
ER+/MCF-7 cells and down-regulates ERα target-genes

and

muscle, respectively. Low levels of NR2E1-mRNA
and NR2E3-mRNA are detectable in mammaryglands and NR2E1 is further down-regulated in breastcancers (Figure 5). Higher NR2E1 expression levels are
observed in Basal relative to Luminal tumors, while the
opposite is true for NR2E3. Limited functional data on
NR2E1 and NR2E3 are available and only few pertain
to the breast-cancer realm. NR2E1 represses target-gene
expression in neuronal-stem-cells [118], is an oncogene
in glioblastoma and inhibits senescence in different cell
types [120]. A recent and seminal paper by Lin et al.
[121] supports the idea that NR2E1 is a potential drug
target for the treatment of ER- breast cancer. In fact
high levels of NR2E1 expression in ER- are a negative
prognostic factor in this type of cancer. Consistent with
this targeted knock-down of NR2E1 inhibits the growth of
different ER- breast cancer cell lines. By converse, overexpression of the nuclear receptor stimulates the formation
of mammospheres, the growth and the invasive behavior
of ER- MDA-MB231 cells [121]. NR2E3 is an ERα
transcriptional activator [122] and it may contribute to
hormone-dependent growth of ER+/tumors, although high
NR2E3 levels are associated with favorable responses to
tamoxifen. NR2E3 oncogenic action may extend to ER-/
tumors, inducing MDA-MB-231 cell migration in-vitro and
metastatic spread in-vivo [122].

NR1D1 and NR1D2 control circadian-rhythms and
regulate fat deposition [110, 111]. Heme seems to be the
endogenous NR1D1/NR1D2 ligand. High NR1D1-mRNA
(UNIGENE-Hs.592130) and NR1D2-mRNA (UNIGENEHs.37288) levels are observed in many tissues. NR1D1and NR1D2-mRNAs are down-regulated in neoplastic
relative to the normal mammary tissues (Figure 5). Basal
tumors are characterized by lower NR1D1 contents
than Luminal-A, Luminal-B or Her2 breast-cancers.
Interestingly, the NR1D1-gene maps close to the ERBB2gene and is often amplified in HER2+ tumors [112]. As for
NR1D2 mRNA, the lowest levels are observed in Normallike tumors. While no studies on NR1D2 in mammarytumors are available, NR1D1 may exert onco-suppressive
effects, as silencing causes reduced growth/apoptosis of
HER2+/BT-474 and ER+/MCF-7 cells [112].

NR2C1 (TR2:testicular-receptor-2) and NR2C2
(TR4:testicular-receptor-4)
NR2C1 and NR2C2 can form heterodimers and
act as transcriptional activators/repressors of other NRs.
NR2C1 and NR2C2 are involved in early embryonic
development and embryonic stem cells [113]. NR2C1mRNA (UNIGENE-Hs.108301) and NR2C2-mRNA
(UNIGENE-Hs.555973) are expressed ubiquitously and
are measurable in mammary-glands. NR2C1 and NR2C2
levels are lower in breast-cancer than normal tissue
(Figure 5). NR2C1 is over-expressed in Basal relative
to Her2 and Normal-like tumors. In ER+/breast-cancer
cells, NR2C1 suppresses ERα-mediated transcriptional
activity, blocking ERα-binding to DNA via formation
of an ERα-NR2C1 heterodimer. This inhibits estrogeninduced cell-growth and G(1)/S transition [114]. NR2C1
may indirectly contribute to ATRA anti-estrogenic activity
in ER+/breast-cancer, as the retinoid controls the activity
of this NR in other cellular contexts [115, 116]. NR2C1
suppresses androgen-mediated AR transactivation, which
may be of therapeutic interest in AR+/mammary-tumors
[117]. The few available data do not provide clues as to the
relevance of NR2C1 and NR2C2 in breast-cancer, but it
can be suggested that the two receptors are anti-oncogenic.

NR2F1 (COUP-TFα:COUP-transcription-factor1α), NR2F2 (COUP-TFβ:COUP-transcriptionfactor-1β) and NR2F6 (COUP-TFγ:COUPtranscription-factor-1γ)
NR2F1, NR2F2 and NR2F6 control embryonic
development. Two NR2F2-protein variants are devoid of a
DNA-binding domain (Table 3). The bindingDB database
(http://www.bindingdb.org) contain several potential
NR2F2-ligands, such as pyridaben. NR2F1-mRNA
(UNIGENE- Hs.519445), NR2F2-mRNA (UNIGENEHs.347991) and NR2F6-mRNA (UNIGENE- Hs.519445)
are expressed ubiquitously. Relative to the normal gland,
mammary-tumors contain smaller and equal amounts
of NR2F1 and NR2F2, respectively. Basal-like tumors
express the lowest levels of both NR2F1 and NR2F2.
Relative to the normal gland, NR2F6 is over-expressed in
all PAM50-classified breast-cancer sub-types (Figure 5).
NR2F1 enhances ERα transcriptional activity
increasing ERK-2 dependent phosphorylation [123].
NR2F1 silencing stimulates ER+/MCF-7 cell-growth invivo [124]. NR2F1 over-expression in MCF-7 cells downregulates CXCL12 and up-regulates the corresponding
receptor, CXCR4, via activation of the EGF-pathway.
This increases MCF-7 cell-growth and cell-motility in
response to CXCL12, suggesting a role for the NR2F1
in metastatic spread [125]. In breast-tumors, high NR2F2
mRNA levels are associated with better overall-survival

NR2E1 (TLX:drosophila-tailless-homolog) and
NR2E3 (PNR:photo-specific-nuclear-receptor)
NR2E1 plays a role in neuronal stem-cells
homeostasis [118], while NR2E3 is involved in retinal
visual function [119]. NR2E1-mRNA (UNIGENEHs.157688) and NR2E3-mRNA (UNIGENE-Hs.187354)
expression is restricted to eye and brain and eye and

and increased time-to-metastasis. NR2F2 silencing does
not affect the growth/survival, while it increases MCF-7
and ER-/MDA-MB-231 cell-migration. NR2F2 inhibits
TGFβ-dependent EMT in both cell-lines [126]. NR2F2
down-regulation is associated with anti-estrogen resistance
and NR2F2 over-expression reinstates sensitivity [127].
NR2F2 over-expression in ER-/MDA-MB435 cells causes
growth-inhibition and G2/M phase arrest. Taken together
the available results indicate that NR2F1 and NR2F2 are
characterized by onco-suppressive properties in breast
cancer, suggesting that strategies aimed at increasing
their expression levels or aimed at stimulating their
transcriptional activity are likely to be of therapeutic
value. There are no studies on the significance of NR2F6
in mammary-tumors. However, given over-expression
in all breast-cancer sub-types, NR2F6 may be a prooncogene.

cancer growth, although this beneficial effect may be
counterbalanced by increased metastatic-spread.
NR4A2-mRNA is down-regulated in all PAM50
sub-types relative to the normal mammary tissue and,
consistent with data obtained at the protein level [132],
Basal tumors contain the smallest NR4A2 amounts
(Figure 5). In primary breast-cancer, NR4A2 expression
is inversely correlated with lymph-node metastases and
directly correlated with increased relapse-free survival,
suggesting onco-suppressive properties. In spite of this,
NR4A2 silencing in Basal cell-lines decreases xenograft
growth [133]. NR4A2 inhibits aromatase expression in
mammary-gland stromal adipocytes [134] and this action
may have implications for breast-cancer prevention, as
obesity and estrogen production are breast-cancer riskfactors. The few data available in mammary-tumors
support therapeutic strategies based on NR4A2-agonists.
As the NR4A2 E-region is occupied by hydrophobic
molecules, which prevents synthetic ligand accessibility
[135], the observation that 6-mercaptopurine activates
NR4As by targeting the N-terminal portion discloses new
avenues in the design of agonists [136].
Although NR4A3-mRNA is generally downregulated in breast-cancer relative to the normal gland,
Basal contain larger amounts than Luminal-A or
Luminal-B tumors (Figure 5), confirming the results of
a study showing NR4A3 up-regulation in TN relative
to Luminal breast-tumors [137]. This suggests an oncosuppressive role of NR4A3 in mammary-tissue, consistent
with the NR4A3 growth-inhibitory action in other cellular
contexts [138, 139]. Onco-suppression in breast-cancer
is supported by NR4A3 up-regulation during apoptosis
in MCF-7 cells [140]. NR4A3 induction in MCF-7 cells
by the cyto-differentiating agent, ATRA, is also consistent
with NR4A3 onco-suppressive potential [141].

NR4A1 (NUR77:nuclear-receptor-related-77),
NR4A2 (NURR1:nuclear-receptor-related-1) and
NR4A3 (NOR-1:nuclear-orphan-receptor-1)
NR4A1, NR4A2 and NR4A3 may control targetgene expression in a ligand-independent manner, acting as
homodimers or RXR-heterodimers. NR4As are implicated
in cell-cycle regulation, apoptosis, inflammation and
metabolism [128]. The only known NR4A ligands/
activators are prostaglandin-A2 and 6-mercaptopurine
which target NR4A3 (Table 3). NR4A1-mRNA is
expressed in many tissues, including mammary-glands,
although peripheral-nerves and adipose-tissue the
highest levels (UNIGENE-Hs.524430). NR4A2-mRNA
expression is restricted to bone-marrow, adrenal-glands,
oviduct and sympathetic-ganglions,. The richest NR4A3
sources are adipose tissue, adrenal-glands and peripheral
nerves (UNIGENE-Hs.279522). Mammary-glands contain
similar levels of NR4A2 and NR4A3 transcripts.
Smaller NR4A1-mRNA amounts are observed in
all PAM50 mammary-tumor types relative to the normal
gland (Figure 5). Luminal-A and Normal-like show higher
NR4A1 mRNA levels than Luminal-B tumors. NR4A1agonists induce apoptosis in mammary-tumor cells [129],
although NR4A1 apoptotic activity is not necessarily
related to NR4A1 transcriptional activity. In ER+/MCF7 cells, the apoptotic action of a natural coumarin and
Plexin-D1 [130] requires JNK-dependent phosphorylation
of NR4A1 and translocation from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm, where the NR binds and inhibits BCL-2.
NR4A1 activation reduces breast-cancer cell-migration,
[131], although NR4A1-silencing inhibits TGF-β-induced
EMT suggesting an opposite effect. The effect on EMT
is consistent with the observation that inflammatory
cytokines induce NR4A1 and enhance TGF-β-dependent
breast-cancer cell-invasiveness in-vitro and in-vivo.
Thus, NR4A1 induction/activation may reduce breastwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

NR6A1 (GCNF:germ-cell-nuclear-factor)
NR6A1 plays a crucial role in embryonic-stem-cell
(ESC) homeostasis [142]. In ESC, NR6A1 is a positive
determinant of pluripotency being down-regulated
by the differentiating-agent, ATRA [99]. In adults,
NR6A1-mRNA tissue-specific expression is limited to
ovary and testis (UNIGENE-Hs.586460). Mammaryglands contain very low amounts of NR6A1 which are
generally up-regulated in breast-cancer (Figure 5). The
PAM50 subtypes showing the highest levels of NR6A1
up-regulation are Basal and Luminal-B tumors. The first
observation is supported by a recent study indicating
NR6A1 gene-expression enrichment in TN/ and ER+/
tumors [143]. These data suggest that NR6A1 may be
endowed with oncogenic properties in breast-cancer.

CONCLUSION

in all mammary tumor-subtypes and targeting it results in
similar anti-tumor effects, as recently demonstrated for
the activation of RARs by ATRA and derived retinoids
[5]. Thus, studies should not be limited to evaluating
differential effects in the ER+/ and ER-/cellular context,
as traditionally done, but should take into consideration
other identified breast cancer sub-groups such as the
PAM50 classes used in this review. In addition, when
different protein-variants of a specific NR are known, it
is important to gather information as to the specific forms
predominantly expressed in each breast-cancer subtype. In
fact, this type of information is not available and should be
gathered, as different protein-variants may have opposite
effects in terms of oncogenic or onco-suppressive activity.
Finally, the side effects potentially triggered by targeting a
specific NR in breast-cancer should be considered before
designing any targeted therapeutic strategy. With respect
to this, a preliminary analysis of the data available on the
tissue-distribution and physiological function of each NR
is likely to be helpful in the selection of the specific NR
to be targeted.

Integration of the expression and functional
data available allows a reliable prediction of the oncosuppressive or oncogenic role played by many of the
NRs considered in breast-cancer (Tables 1, 2, 3). Within
the Lipid-Sensors group, NR1C3, NR1H2 and NR1H3
are likely to play an onco-suppressive action. NR1F1,
NR2A1 and NR3B3 (Enigmatic-Orphans) as well as
NR0B1, NR0B2, NR1D1, NR2F1, NR2F2 and NR4A3
(Orphan-Receptors) seem to exert a similar activity. These
NRs represent viable candidates for the development of
therapeutic strategies aimed at increasing their expression
or activating them in tumor cells. The availability of
pharmacological agonists for NR1C3, NR1H2, NR1H3,
NR1F1, NR0B2, and NR4A3 should boost pre-clinical
studies in this direction. For all the remaining NRs, efforts
should be oriented towards the design and synthesis of
selective and high-affinity agonists. Except for NR1D1
and NR2F1, whose levels are significantly lower in Basallike relative to the other PAM50 subgroups, the expression
profiles of the transcripts encoding the above mentioned
NRs do not indicate any expression specificity in terms
of breast-cancer subtypes. Nevertheless, as indicated in
Table 2 and on the basis of the available literature, NR1F1
may be of particular significance as a therapeutic target
in ER- breast cancer. The group of NRs endowed with
potential oncogenic properties in breast-cancer is smaller
and consists of the Lipid-Sensors, NR1C2 and NR1I2,
the Enigmatic-Orphans, NR1F3, NR3B1 and NR5A2,
as well as the Orphan-Receptors, NR2E1, NR2E3 and
NR6A1. To obtain anti-tumor effects, oncogenic NRs
should be targeted with selective antagonists, reverseagonists or agents/strategies capable of reducing their
expression in breast-cancer cells. At present only synthetic
antagonists targeting NR1C2, NR1I2 and NR1F3 are
available. On the basis of the expression profiles in the
PAM50 subgroups, we propose that NR1C2, NR1I2 and
NR2E1 are pharmacological targets of particular interest
in Basal-like tumors. In the case of NR2E1, this is line
with the evidence present in the literature which indicates
that targeting of the receptor is particularly promising in
ER- mammary tumors [121]. A similar relevance in ER- is
predicted also for NR1F3, as indicated in Table 2. Similar
considerations suggest that NR1C2 and NR3B1 may be
a useful targets in Her2 breast cancer as well (Tables 1,
2). Finally the interest of NR3B1 may not be limited to
this last group, as it may extend to ER- mammary tumors
regardless of HER2-positivity (Table 2).
In the case of both onco-suppressive and oncogenic
NRs there are some general points that should be
considered and were touched upon in this review. Studies
focusing on NR-targeting should be aimed at establishing
the therapeutic potential in specific types of breast cancer
given the heterogeneity of the disease. It is, indeed, highly
unlikely that each of the identified NRs plays the same role
