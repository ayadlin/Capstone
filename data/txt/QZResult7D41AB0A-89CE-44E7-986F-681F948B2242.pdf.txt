ABSTRACT
A prospective study was conducted to identify biomarkers associated with
resistance to panitumumab monotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal
cancer (mCRC). Patients with previously treated, codon 12/13 KRAS wt, mCRC were
prospectively administered panitumumab 6mg/kg IV q2weeks. Of 34 panitumumabtreated patients, 11 (32%) had progressive disease at 8 weeks and were classified
as non-responders.
A Nanostring nCounter-based assay identified a 5-gene expression signature
(ERBB2, MLPH, IRX3, MYRF, and KLK6) associated with panitumumab resistance
(P = 0.001). Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization determined that the HER2
(ERBB2) protein was overexpressed in 4/11 non-responding and 0/21 responding
cases (P = 0.035). Two non-responding tumors had ERBB2 gene amplification only,
and one demonstrated both ERBB2 amplification and mutation. A non-codon 12/13
KRAS mutation occurred in one panitumumab-resistant patient and was mutually
exclusive with ERBB2/HER2 abnormalities.
This study identifies a 5-gene signature associated with non-response to
single agent panitumumab, including a subgroup of non-responders with evidence
of aberrant ERBB2/HER2 signaling. KRAS wt tumors resistant to EGFRi may be
identified by gene signature analysis, and the HER2 pathway plays an important role
in resistance to therapy.

INTRODUCTION

of patients having progressive disease as best response
[3]. Excluding patients with KRAS mutated tumors and
other recently described RAS mutants [9, 10], reduces this
proportion to approximately 30% of patients without response
to EGFRi therapy. Determining which patients are unlikely
to respond to EGFRi therapy will spare the patient from
treatment-related toxicity and allow them to be directed to
other therapeutic options or clinical trials, thus gaining time.
Inter-tumoral heterogeneity in CRC has been
demonstrated in whole genome expression array studies,
with the identification of six and three biological
subtypes in two large, recent cohorts, respectively [7, 11].
Furthermore, gene expression-based drug sensitivity
predictors have been shown to be the superior to other
genomic, epigenomic, and proteomic drug sensitivity
predictors across human breast cancer cell lines [12]. Gene

Colorectal cancer (CRC) has high rates of metastasis
and recurrence [1, 2]. Therapy for advanced disease includes
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-inhibitors,
including cetuximab and panitumumab, which have only
shown effectiveness in RAS non-mutated tumors, though
demonstrating a marked range of clinical response rates
[3–5]. This heterogeneous response rate may be due to
substantial intrinsic molecular differences among these
tumors, including, but not limited to, mitogen-activated
protein–kinase (MAPK/ERK) and phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K/Akt) pathways, and anti-apoptosis [6–8].
Phase III trials of patients with metastatic KRAS unselected
mCRC treated with single agent EGFR inhibitors (EGFRi)
reported a high rate of resistance to therapy, with 70%

expression signatures already have an established role in risk
stratification and treatment selection in some settings, most
notably in early stage breast and colon cancers [13–15].
In this phase II biomarker study, we aimed to
identify molecular markers in KRAS wt mCRC that
would identify patients resistant to EGFRi therapy. We
determined the presence of molecular determinants of
primary resistance to EGFRi therapy, defined as disease
progression within 8 weeks of commencing single agent
therapy with panitumumab. Gene expression profiling
was conducted with a knowledge-based selection of
candidate genes and targeted next-generation sequencing
was performed. ERBB2/HER2 copy number status and
protein expression quantification was conducted due to
the identification of this gene in the response signature.

the 120 genes had matched expression between BCCA and
TCGA cohorts with over 30% of cases above background
expression after normalization. Performing identical
subsequent analyses on the TCGA-normalized data
identified four highly ranked genes with an FDR below
10%, ERBB2, MLPH, IRX3, and MYRF (Supplementary
Figure 2), and demonstrated very significant association
with panitumumab response (P  = 2.86 × 10−8, CI 95%
= 1.02–1.89). A comparison of all three analyses can be
found in Supplementary Figure 3. While re-performing the
analysis on a smaller set of genes may have inflated the
level of significance, taken together, this analysis bolstered
the significant genes found in the SAM analysis prior to
this normalization method. We noted that EGFR expression
was not significantly associated with panitumumab
response in any of these analyses, despite being the direct
target of panitumumab.

RESULTS

Mutations in RAS, BRAF, and ERBB2

Of the 37 evaluable patients, one demonstrated a
false negative KRAS codon 12 mutation and an additional
two patients did not have sufficient primary tumor
nucleic acid isolation; these patients were removed from
subsequent analyses (Figure 1). Of 34 remaining evaluable
cases, the median age was 64.5 years. All patients
received prior chemotherapy including 59% who received
5-Fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin and 53% received
prior bevacizumab. Response to therapy and median
number cycles of panitumumab are summarized in Table 1.
Eleven of the remaining 34 patients developed progressive
disease (PD) (median # of cycles = 4) at the time of the
initial imaging for response at the 8-week time point
and were classified as non-responders. Of the remaining
23 patients, nine had stable disease (SD) and eight had a
partial response (PR) (median # cycles = 12). Six patients
demonstrated a best response of two-year prolonged
stable disease (median # cycles = 22). For the purposes
of the biomarker analysis, patients were dichotomized into
response groups and defined as non-responders if they had
PD (n = 11) and responders if they had SD, PR, or PSD.

Thirty-one out of 34 evaluable primary tumor cases
included in the study had sufficient genomic DNA and
matching blood DNA to be sequenced by the Illumina-based
Oncopanel. Ten out of 11 matching metastatic tumor
samples also passed these criteria and were sequenced.
Of the 31 primary tumor samples, one KRAS
mutation was found in a non-responding patient (Figure 3).
This G to A transition mutation produced an A146T amino
acid change. A mutation in BRAF (K601E) was also
found in this KRAS A146T mutant patient. This A146T
mutation was also identified in a second patient with PD
that was ultimately excluded from the study on the basis of
unavailable RNA for gene expression analysis. One NRAS
mutation at Q61L was also identified in a patient with
progressive disease. No HRAS mutations were identified.
A total of four BRAF mutations were identified in
the 31 patients, two in patients with PD and two in patients
with SD. One of the two patients with PD had the V600E
mutation and the other with a K601E mutation. Of patients
with SD, one had a K601E mutation and the other had an
L597R mutation. One patient classified as having a partial
response had a frame shift mutation in EGFR itself, likely
abrogating EGFR pathway activation.
There was one patient with a mutation in ERBB2
classified as a non-responder. This was a homozygous
V747L mutation that occurred in the tyrosine kinase
domain of the protein; however, we are unaware of any
study reporting the functional significance of this mutation
at the time of this study.
Three patients had PDGFRA mutations, of which
two were EGFRi non-responders. One of these PDGFRA
mutations occurred in a resistant patient with a coexisting
NRAS mutation. KIT mutations were found in two patients
within the responder group. Infrequent mutations in
MTOR and PIK3CA were also found in both responders
and non-responders.

Gene expression analysis identified 5 genes
significantly associated with non-response to
panitumumab
We identified five highly ranked genes with a
positive correlation with panitumumab resistance below
an FDR of 15% by Significance Analysis of Microarrays
(SAM); ERBB2, MLPH, IRX3, MYRF, and KLK6 (Figure
2). Two of these genes, ERBB2 and MLPH, had a FDR of
0%. These two genes alone were borderline significantly
associated with non-response to panitumumab (P = 0.05,
CI 95% = 0.0015–1.98), but the five-gene signature
demonstrated a more significant association (P = 0.001, CI
95% = 0.597–2.16). Recognizing the weakness of a small
cohort size, we performed normalization with the 220 cases
of KRAS wt mCRC from the TCGA cohort. Ninety-five of

Immunohistochemistry and FISH demonstrate
over-activity of the HER2 pathway in a subset of
RAS-BRAF wt panitumumab non-responders

with HER2/CEP ratios of > 2.1 (Figure 3). Three of these
amplified cases demonstrated PD after panitumumab and
had average copy numbers exceeding 8 copies of ERBB2.
The fourth amplified case had HER2/CEP ratio of 2.2 and
demonstrated stable disease.

Of the 35 assessable TMA cases, two did not
undergo the gene expression assay and one had KRAS
mutated codon 12, so were excluded as described earlier.
Twenty-six out of 32 cases were negative (score = 0),
5/32 cases were low (score = 1), and 4/32 cases were
high (score = 3+) for HER2 protein expression (Figure 3).
The level of HER2 protein expression was significantly
associated with resistance to panitumumab (Fisher’s exact
test, P = 0.035).
FISH was also performed on cases of the TMA with
adequate tumor tissue and KRAS wt as for IHC, removing
the same 3 cases from a total of 37. An additional
9 cases did not have adequate FISH results for assessment,
leaving 25 cases with measurable ERBB2 copy number.
ERBB2 amplification was correlated significantly with
panitumumab resistance (P = 0.009, CI 95% 0.418–2.68).
Four cases were found to have amplification of ERBB2

DISCUSSION
The objective of this prospective, exploratory
biomarker study was to identify biomarkers associated
with resistance to panitumumab therapy in KRAS wt
mCRC on archival paraffin embedded tissue. Eleven out
of 34 patients (32%) with KRAS wt (codons 12/13) mCRC
did not respond to single agent panitumumab. A 5-gene
signature was developed including ERBB2 and MLPH on
the Nanostring® nCounter platform, and strongly associated
with non-response to therapy. HER2 protein amplification
was present in 13.8% (4/29) of all-RAS wt cases and was
significantly associated with non-response to therapy.
A recently described 180-gene predictor assay was
found to significantly classify EGFR-inhibitor-treated lung

and colon adenocarcinoma disease types into high and low
response groups [16]. The authors found 26 genes from the
180-gene set were adequate to significantly classify high
and low cetuximab responders in KRAS wt mCRC. These
genes were represented in the PI3K/AKT and MAPK
pathways downstream of EGFR. A separate phase I doseescalation cetuximab trial in a KRAS wt mCRC cohort
reported a non-overlapping set of 6 genes associated
with response to EGFR inhibition, though the biological
significance of these genes is currently unknown [13].
None of these 6 genes were represented in the expression
signature of the current study.
A subset of poor-prognosis BRAF-mutant-like
(BRAFm) patients, defined as having tumors with gene
expression profiles similar to known BRAFm tumors, were
previously identified in a KRAS wt CRC cohort using a
predictor based on differential expression of 32 gene pairs
[17]. Remarkably, the BRAFm predictor identified 13%
of KRAS wt CRC patients with a much poorer prognosis
(P = 0.022), capturing a significant number of non-BRAF
mutant patients with a BRAFm expression signature. We
included these 64 genes in the present study, reasoning
a BRAF-mutant-like phenotype may be associated with
non-response to EGFR-directed therapies. Indeed, MYRF,
MLPH, and IRX3 expression - genes implicated in the
BRAF-mutant-like phenotype - were associated with nonresponders. Overexpression of these three genes was most
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

significantly associated with panitumumab non-response
aside from ERBB2, and thus may represent a relevant
molecular pattern of panitumumab resistance by aberration
and/or bypass of the EGFR signaling pathway for cancer
cell survival. IRX3 may be implicated in colorectal
tumorigenesis by reducing tumor cell sensitivity to the Dpp/
TGFβ pathway, granting tumor cells a growth advantage
[18]. MLPH and MYRF have not been specifically
described as linked to EGFRi resistance in CRC tumors, so
this is a novel finding of this study.
The presently described outcomes are comparable
with other studies. Peeters et al. reported 16% of patients
with KRAS wt (codons 12/13/61) tumours showed no
objective response to panitumumab monotherapy [9].
Among patients with KRAS wt (codons 12/13/61),
nine and 13 out of 138 patients showed mutations in
NRAS and BRAF, respectively, all of which showed no
objective response to panitumumab. Patients with mutant
TP53 and PIK3CA showed response rates of 17 and
20%, respectively. Doulliard et al. found that additional
mutations in KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF in patients with
KRAS wt codons 12/13 conferred an inferior progression
free survival and overall survival for those treated with
panitumumab-FOLFOX4 therapy [10]. Seventeen percent
of KRAS wt codons 12/13 patients had these additional
RAS mutations. Of note, one patient in our study had an
A146T mutation in KRAS, unreported by routine clinical
18956

Oncotarget

hotspot mutation assays. Previous evidence suggests that
KRAS A146T mutations may have oncogenic potential
in other cancer types [18–20]. Of note, the KRAS
mutant patient also bore a K601E mutation in BRAF,
an exceedingly rare occurrence. We suspect that the two
mutations may have contributed to a lack of response to
panitumumab in this patient [21].
Interestingly, four BRAF mutations were identified
in the cohort, two in patients with resistant tumors and
two in patients with stable disease. BRAF mutation is
a powerful prognostic marker in mCRC conferring a
significantly shorter overall survival regardless of type
of systemic therapy [22, 23]. Despite some evidence
[22], mutations in BRAF have not been consistently
established as a predictive marker for EGFRi resistance,
and current treatment recommendations do not exclude
these patients from EGFRi therapy. However, in a large
randomized clinical trial of irinotecan plus panitumumab
versus irinotecan alone, the latter was favored in cases
harboring BRAF mutations [24]. The variability of BRAF
as a marker of EGFRi resistance is reflected in this study
as BRAF mutations occurred in both 20% of resistant (PD)

and 9.5% of responsive (SD/PR/PSD) tumors. This may
highlight the value of a gene response signature to further
distinguish resistant from responsive disease in BRAF
mutant mCRC.
The significance of mutations found in PDGFRA
and KIT are currently unclear. Activating PDGFR
mutations have been implicated in a favorable tumor
microenvironment and angiogenesis [25]. While possible
that a relationship exists between PDGFR mutation and
lack of response to EGFRi therapy, the low frequency
of these mutations in the present cohort, as well as
a confounding NRAS mutation, was not adequate to
support this. However, the CORRECT clinical trial of
multi-kinase (including PDGFR) inhibitor regorafenib in
mCRC patients who previously failed panitumumab and/
or cetuximab demonstrated a significant benefit both in
progression-free and overall survival (HR = 0.5 and 0.71,
respectively) [26]. This seems to suggest that a variety of
tyrosine kinases, including PDGFR, may be involved in
tumor resistance to agents targeting specific oncogenic
targets, such as EGFRi. There have been no reports of KIT
involvement in EGFRi responsiveness in the colorectal

cancer literature, and the presence of these mutations in
the responder group is of unknown significance.
We queried the TCGA data for alterations in the
5 top ranked genes from our gene expression analysis
using the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics from Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center [27, 28]. Thirteen (6%)
of the CRC cases from the TCGA database (N = 224)
had gene alterations in ERBB2, 7 of which were gene
amplifications (3.1%). All ERRB2 amplified cases were
mutually exclusive of alterations in MYRF, MLPH, IRX3,
and KLK6. KLK6 was altered in 4 cases (2%), MYRF
was altered in 3 cases (1%), and IRX3 was altered in
2 cases (1%). MLPH was altered in 1 case. The relatively
low frequency of these aberrations may point to their
specificity with regards to predictors for EGFRi resistance.
Of the genes we included in the expression analysis,
ERBB2 overexpression by FISH and IHC was strikingly and
significantly associated with panitumumab non-response.
Previous studies of have reported a rate of HER2 positivity
of 2.0 to 4.3% as defined by HER2 protein expression of 3+
protein or FISH amplification > 2.1 [29–32] in colorectal
tumors. One study reported an overall frequency of 2.3% in
2349 patients reported in the literature [33]. Concordance
of HER2 positivity in paired samples was reported to be
96% [32].

Until recently it was thought that HER2 gene copy
number was not predictive of EGFR-directed therapy
response [34]. However, recent studies do suggest HER2
overexpression by gene amplification may indeed be
related to poor outcome in KRAS wt mCRC patients
treated with cetuximab or panitumumab [35]. In a study
of 137 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors, HER2
amplification was documented in a 13.6% of cases
in patients with cetuximab resistant, KRAS wild-type
tumors [33], a frequency similar to the one documented
in the current study. Two representative KRAS wt, HER2
amplified, cetuximab resistant PDX tumors were treated
with pertuzumab, an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody
preventing dimerization with HER partners including
EGFR, in combination with either lapatinib, a dual EGFR/
HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or cetuximab, and resulted
in substantial and prolonged tumor regression, whereas
pertuzumab alone had no effect. An earlier phase II study
of herceptin, an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, plus
cytotoxic therapy with irinotecan in patients with advanced
HER2 positive (2+ or 3+ protein expression) mCRC,
reported a response to therapy in 5 of 7 patients, but the
study was closed due to poor accrual as only 8% of 138
screened patients were HER2 positive [29]. In the current
study 4 of 29 (13.8%) patients with all-RAS wt tumors had

HER2 overexpression by IHC and/or FISH. This incidence
significantly increases the feasibility of a trial of a dual
EGFR inhibitor combined with HER2 directed therapy in
advanced HER2 positive mCRC. Indeed, a recent phase
II study of combination trastuzumab plus lapatinib in
KRAS wt and HER2 IHC 2/3+ and FISH + cancers met
its primary efficacy endpoint and reported a 32% response
rate in patients with advanced, treatment refractory cancer
[36]. This lends strong support to ERBB2 as relevant
therapeutic biomarker in mCRC.
In conclusion, this study represents a primary
effort to define a novel gene expression signature based
on differentially expressed genes in KRAS wt mCRC
not responsive to EGFRi, in particular, panitumumab
monotherapy. A five-gene expression signature was found
to be highly associated with panitumumab resistance in
mCRC, with ERBB2 and MLPH as the top differentially
expressed genes. We intend to explore if this gene
expression signature is unique to mCRC or has utility
in other tumor sites as well. The secondary goal was to
identify possible mechanisms of panitumumab resistance
by targeted resequencing of implicated genes of the EGFR
and HER2 signaling pathways and protein expression and
gene amplification of HER2 and ERBB2, respectively. We
detected molecular aberrations associated with EGFRi
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

resistance in 6 out of 10 of non-responding patients. Further
modeling and validation of the gene expression signature in
a larger, independent cohort may allow refined prediction
of resistant cases. A prospective screening method to
identify patients least likely to respond to panitumumab
monotherapy will spare patients from unnecessary exposure
to EGFRi administration and toxicity and will help to
redirect these patients to an alternative therapy or clinical
trial earlier, enhancing their chances of a positive outcome.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient eligibility and study design
A total of 40 patients with KRAS wt (codons 12
and 13) advanced mCRCs with measurable disease were
prospectively enrolled at three BCCA cancer centers on
an exploratory biomarker study. Patients were previously
treated with 5-Fluorouracil and received, or were ineligible
for, prior oxaliplatin/5-FU and irinotecan and were treated
with panitumumab 6mg/kg IV q2w until progression or
toxicity. None of the patients enrolling on this study had
ever been exposed to prior anti-EGFR therapy, either as
a single agent or in combination with an irinotecan-based
regimen. Computed Tomography (CT) was done at baseline
18959

and every 8 weeks to assess response. The primary endpoint
was tumor response and patients were classified by standard
RECIST criteria as Progressive Disease (PD), Stable Disease
(SD), Prolonged Stable Disease ≥ 24 weeks (PSD) or Partial
Response (PR). For the biomarker analysis, patients with
PD were classified as non-responders and patients with SD,
PSD24 or PR were classified as responders to panitumumab.
The primary objective of the study was to determine rates
of response and non-response by RECIST to single agent
panitumumab therapy and the study was powered to detect
biomarkers with a frequency of 20–50%. The study was
approved by the institutional REB and was registered on
clinicaltrials.gov study NCT00853931.
Sample collection, experimental steps, and analytical
workflow are summarized in Figure 1. Of 40 KRAS wt
mCRC patients treated with panitumumab monotherapy,
37 were evaluable for response to therapy. One patient
with a KRAS mutation identified in codon 12 that was not
identified by standard clinical testing was excluded from
all analyses. Two samples that did not have sufficient RNA
for the Nanostring assay requirements, nor did not pass
expression data quality control determined by nSolver
software (Nanostring), were also excluded, leaving a total
of 34 patients included in the final analysis.

was normalized to the same dimensional space as the wt
cases from the 220-case TCGA cohort and sample-to-sample
geomean normalized using eight 8 housekeeping genes:
ACTB, GUSB, PSMC4, RPLP0, PUM1, SF3A1, TFRC,
and MRPL19. Genes with expression above background in
fewer than 30% of cases after normalization were removed.
Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to visualize the
dimensional space of the BCCA and TCGA cohort datasets.
Two-class unpaired Significance Analysis of
Microarrays (SAM) was used to identify the top ranked
genes associated with resistance to panitumumab in the
BCCA cohort. For the cases where matched primary- and
metastatic-derived tumor samples were both available,
metastatic samples were included for SAM analysis in
place of primary tumor samples. False Discovery Rate
(FDR), or q-value, was used to identify the genes most
significantly associated with panitumumab response.
A T-statistic, called the score(d), was calculated by
calculating a “d” statistic for each gene based on its linear
regression with the outcome. “d” statistics are ordered
and plotted against their expected order statistics after a
large number of random permutations of the response data.
The score(d) represented how far the “d” statistic is from
the expected order statistic and was used to weight each
corresponding gene within a signature equation. Weighted
average expression of top ranked genes was calculated in
each analyses and association with panitumumab response
was performed by two-tailed unpaired Welch’s T-test,
which reports a 95% confidence interval for the difference
in means of responders vs. non-responders.
Since the BCCA study cohort was composed
entirely of KRAS wt tumors, we sought to identify if there
was any expression bias of 120 selected gene expression
profiles within a larger mixed KRAS wt and mutant CRC
tumor cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
database. Two hundred and twenty colon adenocarcinoma
tumor samples with both global gene expression profiles
and somatic mutational analysis were collected from
TCGA. Gene expression and somatic mutation data from
the TCGA cohort were previously measured with a custom
Agilent 244K array and both SOLiD 4 and Illumina HiSeq
platforms, respectively. Global gene expression profiles
were abridged to only represent the 120 candidate genes.
Since the BCCA cohort size was relatively small
and represented a biased population based in terms of
KRAS wt status, we determined whether a gene expression
bias was present between known KRAS mutant and wt
cases. We assessed this by principal component analysis
(Supplementary Figure 1). By normalizing the BCCA
cohort dataset to the much larger TCGA cohort, the BCCA
cohort dataset shifted to overlap with the TCGA cohort
dataset correcting platform variation between datasets.

Gene expression profiles
Gene selection and probe design
A 120-gene Nanostring nCounter codeset was
designed from previously reported gene sets predictive
of BRAF mutation status and cetuximab response in
mCRC [13, 17, 37], and a hypoxia signature predictive of
metastasis in a broad range of tumor types [38]. Additional
genes of interest such as RAD51, EGFR, ERBB2, and
CRYAB were also included [35, 39–42]. The complete
gene list can be found in Supplementary Table 1.

Nucleic acid isolation and expression profiling
Total ribonucleic acid (RNA) and genomic
deoxyribonucleic acid (gDNA) was isolated from
duplicate 1mm diameter cores taken from FFPE tissue
blocks with a Total Nucleic Acid Extraction kit (Qiagen).
Qubit and Nanodrop-1000 spectrophotometry measured
quantity and quality of RNA, respectively. Samples
with a minimum quantity threshold of 12.5 ng/ul and a
260/280 quality ratio between 1.7 and 2.3 were included
in the nCounter assay as previously described [43]. The
nCounter assay was performed following recommended
protocols using between 100 and 250 ng of total RNA.

Oncopanel was performed. This sequencing panel included
genes suspected to confer resistance to EGFR-directed
therapy beyond KRAS codons 12 and 13 mutations, such as in
other regions of the RAS homologs. A minimum of 250 ng of
genomic DNA was submitted for Illumina-based Oncopanel
targeted resequencing. The coding exonic sequence and
at least 2bp of flanking intronic sequence of each target
was determined from the source DNA material following
RainDance-mediated primer-DNA droplet merging, PCR
amplification and Illumina sequencing. Resulting sequences
were aligned to the GRCh37 human genome reference using
BWA (version 0.7.5a, mem algorithm). Variant calling was
performed using VarScan2 (v2.3.6), with the minimum allele
frequency threshold for reporting variants set to 0.1. cDNA
nucleotide numbering begins at the A of the initiating codon
(ATG) as per HGVS convention of the reference sequences
(Supplementary Table 2).

As ERBB2 gene expression showed the highest
association in tumours that did not respond to
panitumumab, immunohistochemistry (IHC) of HER2
protein and ERBB2 in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis
was conducted. The antibody used for IHC was specific
to HER2 protein (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc.).
HER2- stained tissue microarray (TMA) slides were scored
as 0 for negative, 1–2 for moderate expression, and 3+ as
positive overexpression based on stain intensity according
to the ASCO/CAP guidelines. Scores were defined as
negative (0–2) or positive (3+) and analyzed by Fisher’s
exact test for significance.
For FISH analysis, TMA slides were stained with
the Inform HER2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail Assay
(Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson AZ) to determine
HER2 gene amplification. Adequate staining was
defined as the presence of both signals in at least 20
nuclei, performed on duplicate cores when possible.
The numbers of HER2 and chromosome 17 signals were
enumerated in 20 nuclei (only in nuclei containing both
signals). HER2:Chromosome 17 ratios were calculated
by dividing the number of HER2 signals by the number
of chromosome 17 signals in each case; ratios of ≥ 2
were considered to have Her2 amplification. Significance
of ISH results as a continuous variable to response was
analyzed by Welch’s two-tailed T-test, also reporting
a 95% confidence interval for the difference in means
between responders vs. non-responders.
Adjacent signals were only considered separate
if the distance between the signals was greater or equal
to one signal. Small clusters of HER2 signals where
individual signal counting was impossible were counted
as 6 signals, and large clusters were counted as 12 signals,
as per the manufacturer’s specifications.
