Abstract

Author Manuscript

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are mutagenic and may thereby promote cancer1. Normally, ROS
levels are tightly controlled by an inducible antioxidant program that responds to cellular stressors
and is predominantly regulated by the transcription factor Nrf2 and its repressor protein Keap12-5.
In contrast to the acute physiological regulation of Nrf2, in neoplasia there is evidence for
increased basal activation of Nrf2. Indeed, somatic mutations that disrupt the Nrf2-Keap1
interaction to stabilize Nrf2 and increase the constitutive transcription of Nrf2 target genes were
recently identified, suggesting that enhanced ROS detoxification and additional Nrf2 functions
may in fact be pro-tumorigenic6. Here, we investigated ROS metabolism in primary murine cells

following the expression of endogenous oncogenic alleles of K-Ras, B-Raf and Myc, and find that
ROS are actively suppressed by these oncogenes. K-RasG12D, B-RafV619E and MycERT2 each
increased the transcription of Nrf2 to stably elevate the basal Nrf2 antioxidant program and
thereby lower intracellular ROS and confer a more reduced intracellular environment. Oncogenedirected increased expression of Nrf2 is a novel mechanism for the activation of the Nrf2
antioxidant program, and is evident in primary cells and tissues of mice expressing K-RasG12D and
B-RafV619E, and in human pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, genetic targeting of the Nrf2 pathway
impairs K-RasG12D-induced proliferation and tumorigenesis in vivo. Thus, the Nrf2 antioxidant
and cellular detoxification program represents a previously unappreciated mediator of
oncogenesis.

Author Manuscript

To examine the role of ROS in cellular transformation and tumorigenesis, we utilized an
endogenous and conditional oncogenic LSL-K-RasG12D allele7. K-RasG12D/+ and KRasLSL/+ MEFs were compared to MEFs and NIH3T3 fibroblasts (NIH3T3s) transduced
with K-Ras4BG12D and H-RasV12 (Fig. 1a), since ectopic Ras introduction was previously
reported to increase ROS production8. In contrast to ectopic overexpression of oncogenic
Ras, K-RasG12D/+ MEFs demonstrated lower levels of hydrogen peroxide, superoxide, and
mitochondrial ROS compared to K-RasLSL/+ MEFs (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 2a,b).
Accordingly, the level of 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dGuo), one of the
major products of DNA oxidation, was decreased in MEFs expressing endogenous KRasG12D/+, but increased by ectopic oncogenic Ras (Fig. 1b). The levels of ROS and 8-oxodGuo were also lower in p53-/-; K-RasG12D/+ MEFs compared to p53-/-; K-RasLSL/+ MEFs
(Supplementary Fig. 2c,d), supporting that these differences are not due to differential
activation of a senescence program and demonstrating that increased ROS production is not
required for full transformation7,9.

Because alterations of ROS can affect the intracellular redox state10, the ratio of reduced/
oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) was examined in cells expressing ectopic and
endogenous K-RasG12D. While both elevated the level of total glutathione (Fig. 1d,f and ref.
11), only the endogenous expression of K-RasG12D elevated the GSH/GSSG ratio to
promote a more reduced intracellular environment (Fig. 1c,e). The production of ROS by
ectopic oncogenic Ras is chiefly regulated by NADPH-oxidase (Nox)12. Only the ectopic
overexpression of oncogenic Ras increased Nox activity and mRNA, providing a
mechanistic explanation for these differing results (Supplementary Fig. 3). Similar to
oncogenic Ras, ectopic expression of Myc has also been shown to increase the production of
ROS in NIH3T3 fibroblasts13 and accordingly we sought to determine whether nearphysiological expression of this oncogene had a similar effect. Treatment of R26MER/MER
MEFs, which express a homozygous MycERT2 allele under the control of the Rosa26
promoter14, with 4-OHT resulted in a substantial reduction of ROS (Fig. 1g). However, this
was not a characteristic feature of all oncogenic stimuli as expression of activated Notch1
and β-catenin did not lower ROS (Supplementary Fig. 4). Therefore, endogenous expression
of oncogenic K-Ras or MycERT2 lowers the level of cellular ROS, in contrast to the ectopic
overexpression of these oncogenes.

As the intracellular redox state is chiefly regulated by Nrf2, we examined Nrf2 protein levels
and activity in K-RasLSL/+ and K-RasG12D/+ MEFs by western blot, reporter assay and
chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of the Nrf2 target genes Hmox1 and Nqo1.
Expression of K-RasG12D resulted in an approximately two-fold increase in Nrf2 protein and
binding activity compared to control MEFs (Fig. 2a,b, Supplementary Fig. 5a), which was
not attributable to altered regulation by Keap12 (Supplementary Fig. 6). K-RasG12D/+ MEFs
demonstrated increased Nrf2 mRNA and increased expression of Hmox1, Nqo1, Gclc, Gclm
and Ggt1 mRNA and protein (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 5b). Increased expression of Nrf2
and its target genes was also observed following K-RasG12D expression in p53-/- MEFs, and
following ectopic expression of K-RasG12D and H-RasV12 in primary MEFs, but not
following expression of activated Notch1 or β-catenin (Supplementary Figs. 5c-g).
However, expression of K-RasG12D in Nrf2-deficient MEFs failed to elevate total
glutathione and resulted in a more oxidized intracellular environment (Fig. 2d,e). Neither the
cell culture conditions employed to express K-RasG12D nor the gene dosage of wild-type KRas affected the expression of Nrf2 target genes (Supplementary Fig. 7a,b). Additionally,
ROS metabolism in wild-type MEFs was sensitive to acute changes in the levels of Keap1
and Nrf2, further supporting a causal relationship between Nrf2 and ROS (Supplementary
Fig. 7c-e). Furthermore, acute knockdown of Nrf2 attenuated the reduction in ROS by KRasG12D (Fig. 2f), and the effects of Nrf2 depletion on ROS were dosage-dependent,
supporting the importance of the level of Nrf2 mRNA for ROS control (Supplementary Fig.
7f,g). Similar to K-RasG12D, activation of c-MycERT2 (with 4-OHT) promoted an increase in
the mRNA and protein levels of Nrf2 and its target genes (Fig. 2g,h, Supplementary Fig.
7h). Furthermore, ChIP-seq data from the ENCODE consortium demonstrated direct binding
of Myc to the Nrf2 locus (Supplementary Fig. 8a)15. Therefore, the K-Ras and Myc
oncogenes can constitutively increase the transcription of Nrf2 to elevate the basal activity
of the antioxidant and cellular detoxification program.

Author Manuscript

To investigate the mechanism of Nrf2 activation by K-RasG12D, the roles of the
Raf/MEK/ERK and p38alpha MAPK pathways were investigated. First, cells were treated
with a potent and specific inhibitor of MEK, AZD6244 (ARRY-142886) (Supplementary
Fig. 9a-c), which restored the ROS level of K-RasG12D/+ cells nearly to the level of KRasLSL/+ cells (Fig. 3a). Additionally, AZD6244 treatment resulted in decreased induction
of Nrf2 and its target genes (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, endogenous expression of B-RafV619E
(corresponding to human B-RafV600E)16 resulted in increased phospho-ERK levels, a
decrease in ROS, and an increase in Nrf2 mRNA and antioxidant gene expression
(Supplementary Fig. 9d-f). As previously reported17, we found that p38alpha MAPK kinase
did not activate Nrf2 (Supplementary Fig. 9g-i). To determine the mechanism of increased
Nrf2 expression, transcription factors downstream of MAPK signaling were examined.
Accordingly, knockdown of Jun, Fra1, and Myc, but not JunD or Elk1, decreased the Nrf2
mRNA in K-RasG12D/+ cells, with almost complete rescue achieved with Jun (Fig. 3c).
siRNA efficiency was confirmed by real-time PCR and western blot (Supplementary Fig.
10a,b). Importantly, K-RasG12D/+ MEFs and B-RafV619E MEFs demonstrated elevated Jun
protein levels compared to control MEFs, and the elevated Jun level in K-RasG12D/+ MEFs
was rescued by treatment with AZD6244 (Fig. 3d). Furthermore, depletion of Jun with
siRNA prevented the decrease in ROS following expression of K-RasG12D (Fig. 3e,

Supplementary Fig. 10c). Our results reinforce a prior finding that antioxidant response
elements that closely resemble AP-1 sites help regulate the Nrf2 promoter18. Finally, ChIPseq revealed that the transcriptional start site of the Nrf2 locus is a direct binding target of
Jun (Supplementary Fig. 8b)15. Thus, K-RasG12D and B-RafV619E stimulate transcription of
Nrf2 via Jun and Myc.

We next examined whether these oncogenes promote activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant and
cellular detoxification program in vivo. Elevated protein expression of the Nrf2 target gene
Nqo1 and decreased immunoreactivity for 8-oxo-dGuo were evident in K-Ras mutant
murine19 and human preinvasive pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), and in murine lung adenomas expressing B-RafV619E (Fig.
4a, Supplementary Figs. 11a, 12, 13, 14a). PanIN also demonstrated reduced
immunoreactivity for the lipid peroxidation adduct malondialdehyde (MDA)
(Supplementary Fig. 11b). Furthermore, K-RasG12D/+ pancreatic epithelial cells
demonstrated activation of Nrf2 and decreased ROS compared to K-RasLSL/+, while
treatment of human PDA tumor lines with K-Ras siRNA resulted in decreased Nrf2 and
Nqo1 mRNA and an increase in ROS (Supplementary Fig. 15). The activation of Nrf2 in
human pancreatic cancer could not be explained by somatic mutations in NRF2 or KEAP1;
we sequenced over 100 samples of human PDA and identified only one case with a
concomitant KEAP1 and K-RAS mutation (Supplemental material and Supplementary Fig.
14b). Importantly, Nrf2-deficient murine PanIN were negative for Nqo1 and demonstrated
similar levels of 8-oxo-dGuo and MDA in PanIN compared to neighboring morphologically
normal ductal cells, supporting a role for Nrf2 in ROS detoxification in vivo (Fig. 4b,
Supplementary Fig. 11b,c). Nrf2-deficient salivary gland did not demonstrate elevated 8oxo-dGuo immunoreactivity, suggesting that K-RasG12D-expressing cells are more reliant
on Nrf2 for ROS detoxification (Supplementary Fig. 16a). Therefore, an antioxidant
program is operant during tumorigenesis, consistent with our findings that link oncogenic KRas and B-Raf expression with the activation of Nrf2.

To investigate whether activation of Nrf2 promotes K-RasG12D–initiated carcinomas, the
effects of Nrf2 ablation were examined in established mouse models of pancreatic and lung
cancer. Nrf2-deficient pancreata were noted to contain fewer PanIN (Fig. 4c). While the
proliferation of the salivary gland was unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 16b), PanIN from
Nrf2-deficient mice were significantly less proliferative and demonstrated an increased
content of cells exhibiting senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 4d,
Supplementary Fig. 17a). No significant differences were observed in PanIN cell apoptosis
or DNA damage (Supplementary Fig. 17b,c). Senescence was also observed in K-RasG12D/+
MEFs following acute depletion of Nrf2 with siRNA and was dependent on expression of
p53 (Supplementary Fig. 17d). The Nrf2 dependent proliferation defect noted in PanIN was
also observed in MEFs, and both could be rescued by the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine
(Supplementary Fig. 18a,b). Furthermore, treatment of Nrf2+/+ PanIN mice with a
glutathione synthesis inhibitor resulted in a significant decrease in the proliferation of PanIN
but not adjacent acinar cells (Supplementary Fig. 18c-e). Additionally, the role of Nrf2 in
lung cancer development was investigated. Nrf2 deficiency resulted in a significant
reduction in disease burden and proliferation, and an increase in median survival

(Supplementary Fig. 19). While we cannot exclude the potential involvement of non-cell
autonomous effects arising from constitutive Nrf2 deficiency, the major impact appeared to
be restricted to tumor initiation and proliferation of nascent preneoplastic cells. These results
demonstrate that Nrf2 promotes K-RasG12D-initiated pancreatic and lung tumorigenesis and
proliferation.

ROS can stimulate tumorigenesis through the oxidation of DNA and subsequent mutation of
genes that promote carcinogenesis. In contrast, we found that activating an ROSdetoxification program contributed to tumorigenesis, although our study does not exclude a
role for other Nrf2 targets such as drug-metabolizing enzymes and efflux pumps, heat shock
proteins, 26S proteasome subunits, growth factors and receptors6. Future studies will be
necessary to determine the role of these Nrf2 functions in tumors with activated Nrf2.
Increased expression of Nrf2 target genes and increased stability of Nrf2 caused by somatic
mutations in Nrf2 and Keap1 are well documented in human cancer, providing one
mechanism for enhanced Nrf2 activity during tumorigenesis. Our work describes oncogenic
signaling as an alternative mechanism to activate Nrf2 transcription during tumorigenesis
(Supplementary Fig. 1), and suggests that modulation of the redox state is uniformly
important in cancer and may therefore represent a therapeutic opportunity. Thus,
constitutively elevated Nrf2 activity in cancer cells occurs through two distinct mechanisms:
diminished Nrf2 turnover and augmented Nrf2 mRNA levels.

Methods
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation was performed as described25. 5×106 cells were fixed at
37°C in DMEM + 1% Formaldehyde for 10 minutes and lysed in 1% SDS, 10mM EDTA,
50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1 plus protease inhibitors and sonicated for 20 minutes in a cold
water bath until DNA was an average size of 1Kb. Input was saved and lysate was diluted in
IP buffer (1% Triton, 2mM EDTA, 150mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1) and mixed with
beads (Dynal Protein A, Invitrogen) that were pre-bound overnight with Nrf2 antibody
(H-300, Santa Cruz). Chromatin was immunoprecipitated overnight, and beads were washed
6 times with RIPA buffer (50mM HEPES pH 7.6, 1mM EDTA, 0.7% Na deoxycholate, 1%
NP-40, 0.5M LiCl) and twice with TE. Beads were incubated with 1% SDS, 0.1M NaHCO3
for 30 minutes at room temperature, and then crosslinks were reversed on both the input and
the IP by heating overnight in a 65°C water bath. DNA was purified with a QIAquick spin
kit (Qiagen) and Q-PCR was performed in triplicate with power sybr mastermix (Applied

Immunohistochemistry

Author Manuscript

Human tissue was donated for research purposes by patients undergoing pancreatic surgery
at a tertiary hepatopancreaticobiliary referral center (Addenbrookes Teaching Hospitals
NHS Trust, Cambridge, UK). Ethical approval was granted by the local research and ethics
committee (LREC Number: 08/H0306/32). Paraffin embedded mouse and human specimens
were deparaffinized and rehydrated, followed by antigen retrieval in boiling citrate buffer.
The following primary antibodies were used: Ki-67 (SP-6, Neomarkers), Nqo1 (Abcam,
Sigma Aldrich), 8-oxo-dGuo ([N45.1], Abcam), γ -H2AX (Millipore), Cleaved caspase 3
(Cell Signaling), anti-Malondialdehyde (Abcam). HRP-based detection reagents were used
for all IHC except 8-oxo-dGuo, for which AP-based reagents were used. 8-oxo-dGuo
specificity was verified by treating sections for 1 hour with 1U/ml DNase at 37°C. For
quantification of 8-oxo-dGuo, mean signal intensity was calculated using Adobe Photoshop
CS. Immunohistochemistry images were converted to grayscale images, inverted, and mean
pixel 8-oxo-dGuo intensity analyzed. For murine Nqo1 IHC, the Sigma Aldrich anti-Nqo1
antibody was used, and the staining pattern was confirmed to be reproducible with the
Abcam antibody (not shown). The Abcam Nqo1 antibody was used for human tissue.
Luciferase assay
LSL-K-RasG12D and Nrf2-/-; K-RasG12D MEFs were plated in 12 well dishes at a density of
5 × 104 cells/well and infected with a Cignal Lenti ARE Reporter (Qiagen) at an MOI of 10.
After 6 hours the cells were split 1:2 and infected the next day with Ad-mock and Ad-cre.
After 4 days the cells were plated at 70% confluence and analyzed for luciferase activity
using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) with a luminometer. Lysates
were analyzed in duplicate and cells lacking the ARE reporter were included as a control.

Nox Activity assay

Author Manuscript

Cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS, scraped in PBS, and centrifuged to obtain a cell
pellet. The pellet was dounce homogenized in PBS + 1mM MgCl2 + 1mM EGTA +
protease inhibitors and 100ul of homogenate was added to 100ul of 2× reaction buffer (PBS
+ 1mM MgCl2 + 1mM EGTA + 300mM sucrose + 10uM lucigenin [Sigma Aldrich] +
200uM NADPH [Sigma Aldrich]) and relative light units were measured with a
luminometer every minute for 10 minutes. Specificity was confirmed by adding the specific
Nox inhibitor diphenylene iodonium (10uM, Sigma Aldrich). Graphs show one
representative measurement in the linear range (2-3 minutes) and are expressed as relative
light units per μg protein.
Nrf2 stability

Author Manuscript

MEFs were treated with 25ug/ml cycloheximide (Acros Organics) for indicated time points
and total cell lysates extracted and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred to
nitrocellulose (Biorad), and membranes were probed with Anti-Nrf2 antibody, affinity
purified as described.28
Quantification of proliferation and neoplasms

Author Manuscript

Values for proliferation were obtained by counting at least 5 fields of greater than 50 cells.
For PanIN studies, only cells contained in PanIN-1a were included in the analysis
(surrounding stromal, acinar or immune cells were all excluded). Proliferation is determined
as a percentage and therefore represents the number of Ki-67 positive PanIN-1a cells /total
PanIN-1a cells. For quantification of lung disease burden, total lung areas and neoplasm
areas were calculated using Image J29 and disease burden was represented as a percent of
total area. For characterization of individual neoplasms, data was represented as neoplasms/
lung area. For quantification of PanIN per mouse, paraffin embedded pancreata were
sectioned at 100 micron intervals and individual PanIN were counted.
Ras-GTP activity assays
Ras-GTP levels were determined according to the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore).
Membranes were also blotted with anti-Rac antibody (Millipore) as a loading control.
Reagents
4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OHT) was obtained from Sigma Aldrich. AZD6244
(ARRY-142886) was obtained from Symansis.

Senescence-associated b-galactosidase staining
Cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 5 minutes and stained
in staining solution (Citric acid/Phosphate buffer pH 6.0, 150mM NaCl, 2mM MgCl, 5mM
Potassium Ferricyanide, 5mM Potassium Ferrocyanide, and 1mg/ml X-gal) overnight at
37°C. Fields of at least 50 cells were counted, in triplicate. For tissue, fresh pancreas from
mice harboring PanIN was cut into small pieces (approximately 1-3 mm cubes) and fixed for
2 hours in 4% PFA in PBS on ice, and incubated in staining solution overnight at 37°C. The
pieces were then fixed in formalin overnight, followed by a quick processing and embedding

exposure to xylene, and counterstained with nuclear fast red. Five fields of at least 50 cells
were counted per mouse.
Sequencing of KEAP1 and NRF2 in patient samples

Author Manuscript

Xenograft enriched pancreatic cancers were created as described previously30. Cell lines
were obtained from the ATCC (Aspc-1, CAPAN1, CFPAC1, Hs766T, MiaPACA2, Panc-1
and Su86.86) or from other sources. PK8 and PK9 were kindly provided by Dr. A. Horii31.
PL11, PL19, PL23, (kindly provided by Dr. E. Jaffee), and XPA1 (kindly provided by Dr.
A. Maitra) were also used. Genomic DNA from immortalized peripheral blood lymphocytes
of 29 patients with familial pancreatic cancer were obtained from the National Familial
Pancreatic Tumor Registry (NFPTR). The acquisition of human tissues from resection
specimens or the NFPTR was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Johns
Hopkins Hospital. The coding sequences of exons 2-6, encompassing the entire coding
sequence of KEAP1, and exon 2 of NRF2 (official current gene name, NFE2L2),
encompassing the KEAP1 binding domain, were amplified from genomic DNAs using
intronic primers flanking each exon. Primers were designed using Primer3 online software
(http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3). PCR-amplified products were sequenced using nested
primers and an ABI Prism model 3700 Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequence
analysis employed Sequencher™ version 4.8 software (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI).
Identified variants were verified by independent PCR amplification and reverse sequencing
of the amplified products. The somatic or germline nature of each variant was determined by
comparing their respective sequences to matched normal DNA available from the same
patients. The following primers were used:
