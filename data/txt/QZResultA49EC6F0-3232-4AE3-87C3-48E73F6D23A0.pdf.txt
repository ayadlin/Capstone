Abstract
Clinical correlative studies have linked 1p36 deletions with worse prognosis in follicular lymphoma (FL). In
this study, we sought to identify the critical gene(s) in this region that is responsible for conferring inferior
prognosis. BAC array technology applied to 141 FL specimens detected a minimum region of deletion (MRD)
of ∼97 kb within 1p36.32 in 20% of these cases. Frequent single-nucleotide polymorphism–detected copyneutral loss of heterozygosity was also found in this region. Analysis of promoter CpGs in the MRD did not
reveal differential patterns of DNA methylation in samples that differed in 1p36 status. Exon sequencing of
MRD genes identified somatic alterations in the TNFRSF14 gene in 3 of 11 selected cases with matching normal DNA. An expanded cohort consisting of 251 specimens identified 46 cases (18.3%) with nonsynonymous
mutations affecting TNFRSF14. Overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were associated with
the presence of TNFRSF14 mutation in patients whose overall treatment included rituximab. We further
showed that inferior OS and DSS were most pronounced in patients whose lymphomas contained both
TNFRSF14 mutations and 1p36 deletions after adjustment for the International Prognostic Index [hazard
ratios of 3.65 (95% confidence interval, 1.35–9.878, P = 0.011) and 3.19 (95% confidence interval, 1.06–9.57,
P = 0.039), respectively]. Our findings identify TNFRSF14 as a candidate gene associated with a subset of
FL, based on frequent occurrence of acquired mutations and their correlation with inferior clinical outcomes.

Introduction
Follicular lymphoma (FL) is characterized at the karyotype
level by the t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation, which leads to
overexpression of the antiapoptotic gene BCL2 due to relocation in proximity to the IGH enhancer (1–6). In the great majority of cases, additional chromosomal changes are evident,
some of which represent disease-associated events of clonal
evolution. Alterations resulting in deletion of chromosome
band 1p36 constitute the most frequent of these secondary
karyotypic alterations. The 1p36 region has been the focus
of attempts to refine the deletion breakpoints and identify
driver or tumor suppressor gene(s), but historically, these efAuthors' Affiliations: 1Center for Lymphoid Cancer, British Columbia

forts have been hampered by relatively small sample cohorts,
the inclusion of heterogeneous subtypes of lymphoma, and
the low resolution of analytic tools available including standard cytogenetic analysis and chromosome-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Most of these studies have
reported 1p36 aberrations in the form of intrachromosomal
deletions and unbalanced translocations (7–10). Recently developed high-resolution technologies have shed further light
on the issue. Of interest, a study by Ross and colleagues (5) of
58 FL cases analyzed using a 50k single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array showed that 50% of these cases had either
copy number loss or copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity
(cnLOH) at 1p36. O'Shea and colleagues (11), using a lowerresolution 10k SNP assay, found 8% of cases to show cnLOH
but found no evidence of deletions, possibly because of the
low-resolution capability of the array; however, correlation
between 1p36 cnLOH and overall survival (OS) was significant. These studies have highlighted the importance of alternate mechanisms of gene inactivation that may be operative
in FL. Although the affected region of alteration identified in
these studies was still relatively large at 8.5 Mb (5), a specific
candidate gene was not identified.
In a previous study we have shown by karyotype and array
CGH that a region of ∼11 Mb from 1p36.22 to p36.33 was deleted at a frequency of ∼25% in 106 FL specimens, and the
deletion was shown to correlate with risk for development

TNFRSF14 Mutations in Follicular Lymphoma

of mutation frequency and clinical correlative analysis, we included 115 of the 141 cohort plus 136 additional specimens
from our archive, totaling 251 cases with sufficient DNA for
sequencing analysis. Each case had a lymph node biopsy
containing FL obtained at the time of diagnosis or before
systemic therapy and available clinical information that included initial clinical characteristics, age, stage, lactate dehydrogenase level, performance status, number of extranodal
sites, treatment regimen, and clinical outcome (Table 1). It
should be noted that the two cases with homozygous deletion of TNFRSF14 were not included in the 251-patient cohort
because there were insufficient follow-up data for survival
analysis. Of these 251 patients, 35 had paired biopsies taken
at the time of diagnosis and at transformation to aggressive
DLBCL. The samples were accrued over a 20-year period
(March 16, 1987 to September 11, 2007), reviewed by an expert hematopathologist (R.D.G.), and classified according to
2008 WHO criteria (13). Treatment regimens evolved over the
20 years and included observation, localized radiation, and
systemic chemotherapy with or without rituximab, including
rituximab maintenance. Chemotherapeutic regimens ranged
from single-agent fludarabine and chlorambucil to multiagent

of transformed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and
for poor survival outcome independent of clinical risk predictors (6). In this study, we have applied tiling path BAC
array CGH, with a resolution of 80 to 150 kb (12), to a larger
cohort of 141 FL specimens and applied robust computational algorithm to further fine-map the 1p36 deleted region. We
have also used a custom-designed oligonucleotide microarray
targeted to band 1p36, promoter methylation analysis, and
exon sequencing to identify the potential gene of interest.
Further, in an expanded cohort of 251 FL patients, we have
assessed the frequency and clinical effect of somatic mutations of a candidate gene in the 1p36 region.

Materials and Methods
Patient materials
For breakpoint mapping of 1p36 deletions, 141 FL cases
were selected from the Lymphoid Cancer Database of the
British Columbia Cancer Agency, who were diagnosed between 1987 and 1996 based on the availability of sufficient
frozen tumor material for DNA extraction. Of these 141 cases,
103 were included in a previous study (6). For the assessment

regimens such as CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and
prednisone) or CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
vincristine, and prednisone). Information on the percentages
of patients receiving rituximab as part of their first-line
therapy is listed in Table 1. This study was approved by the
University of British Columbia-British Columbia Cancer
Agency Research Ethics Board.
Cytogenetic analysis
Cytogenetic analysis of lymph node specimens was
performed as previously described (8). Fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) was performed on residual cell suspensions using the LSI IGH/BCL2 probe according to the manufacturer's protocol (Vysis) to detect the presence of IGH/
BCL2 genomic fusion. For validation of deletion of the
1p36.32 locus, the BAC clones RP13-493G06, RP13-586E24,
and RP11-756P03 were selected from the array CGH profile
and prepared for use as FISH probes as previously described
(14). BAC RP11-229M05 at 1q32.3 was used as a copy number
control. All BAC clones had previously been identity-verified
by BAC-end sequencing and by hybridization to normal metaphases to confirm the expected site of chromosomal localization. The frequency of false deletion for each BAC FISH
probe was established by hybridization to normal lymphocyte cell suspensions and ranged from 0.5% to 3.0%. For
the purpose of this study, the cutoff value for true deletion
was set at >5% of 200 interphase nuclei. All of the FISH
studies were performed on residual methanol/acetic acid–
preserved cell pellets.
Sample preparation
Genomic tumor DNA was extracted from frozen tissues or
frozen cell suspensions using the ALLPREP kit (Qiagen).
Germline DNA was extracted from peripheral blood in
11 patients using the PureGene DNA purification kit (Gentra).
BAC array CGH and oligonucleotide array analysis
The sub-megabase resolution tiling (SMRT) BAC array
contains 26,819 BAC clones spotted in duplicate on glass
slides and covers >95% of the human genome (15, 16). Array
CGH using this platform was performed as previously described (17). A custom-built high-density Agilent oligonucleotide array was designed using the eArray software (Agilent
Technologies) and contained ∼12,000 60-mer probes with an
average of one probe per 500 bp spanning the first 5,983,478 bp
of the 1p terminus. Hybridization to the custom Agilent array
was performed using 500 ng of tumor DNA according to the
manufacturer's protocol (Agilent Technologies). Analysis of
BAC array CGH data was performed using the joint inference
Hidden Markov Model called Conditional Markov Model
(CMM) proposed by Colella and colleagues, adapted for array
CGH to detect subtle clone shifts in recurrent cases (18). The
model consists of a nonstationary transition matrix indexed by
a probe that is shared across samples, thus allowing for borrowing statistical strength that may be present in recurrent
alterations. Data from the Agilent oligo array were visualized
using the CGHAnalytics 3.0 software (Agilent Technologies)
and analyzed using the supplied statistical algorithm ADM-1,

with the sensitivity threshold set to 5.0, the moving average
window to 1 Mb, and the requirement of 10 consecutive
probes to annotate a loss or a gain.
DNA methylation analysis
CpG's were selected for pyrosequencing based on their
location within the promoter of the associated gene. Specifically, if the gene had a CpG island promoter, CpG's from
within the island were chosen. If the gene did not have an
identified CpG island promoter, CpG's closest to the transcription start site were chosen. PCR primer and sequencing
primer design were performed using the PyroMark software
(Qiagen). Genomic DNA (500 ng) was bisulfite-converted
using the EZ DNA Methylation Gold Kit (Zymo Research Corporation) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cycling
conditions were as follows: 95°C for 15 minutes, 50 cycles of
[94°C for 30 seconds, 57°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 1 minute],
72°C for 10 minutes. PCR products were then prepared for
pyrosequencing as described by Tost and Gut (19) using
the PyroMark reagent kit (Qiagen) and sequencing primers
as listed in Supplementary Table S1. Pyrosequencing was
performed using a PyroMark Q96 ID instrument (Qiagen)
and bisulfite DNA conversion was confirmed using internal
bisulfite conversion controls.
DNA sequencing
Exon sequencing was performed using an ABI 3730xl DNA
analyzer and the Jumpstart Taq DNA polymerase (SigmaAldrich) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each
amplification primer set was tagged with M13F(-21) forward
(5′-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′) and M13 reverse (5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3′) for direct sequencing. Cycling conditions were as follows: 94°C for 1 minute, 30 cycles of 98°C
for 10 seconds, 68°C for 6 minutes, and 72°C for 10 minutes.
Mutation Surveyor software (SoftGenetics LLC) was used to
analyze the sequence data. Information on primer sequences
is provided in Supplementary Table S1.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Software
version 14.0. For methylation analysis, differences among
groups were evaluated by one-way ANOVA. Pearson's χ2 test
was used to determine the significance of any differences
between the clinical variables in mutated versus wild-type
samples. Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier
method and compared using the log-rank test. OS was defined
as the time from diagnosis to date of most recent follow-up
(censored) or death from any cause (event). The Cox proportional hazards model that included the International Prognostic Index (IPI) score was used to determine the significance
of variables in the univariate survival analyses. All statistical
tests were two-sided and considered significant at P ≤ 0.05.

TNFRSF14 Mutations in Follicular Lymphoma

CGH analysis of 106 diagnostic FL biopsies (6). Herein we
report a frequency of 20% in 141 FL cases using an algorithm called CMM joint analysis that identified a minimum
region of deletion (MRD) corresponding to a single BAC
clone with the highest frequency shift (Fig. 1A). This area
is approximately 97 kb in size and contains five genes including HES5, LOC115110, TNFRSF14, C1orf93, and MMEL1.
Information on the BAC clone within the MRD and the
frequency of loss, gain, and copy-neutral state is shown
in Fig. 1A (bottom).
Figure 1B (right) shows four representative array CGH
cases with heterozygous (−/+) and homozygous (−/−) deletions and the corresponding FISH profiles (1p36: red arrowhead; 1q32 control: green arrowhead). All deletions detected
by array CGH were validated by FISH analysis using one or
more of the BAC probes RP13-493G06, RP13-586E24, and
RP11-756P03 with probe RP11-229M05 mapping at 1q32.3
as a copy number control. The majority of the deletions
were shown to be heterozygous, whereas two were homozygous. High-resolution oligonucleotide array analysis was
performed on case 1, which had the smallest array
CGH–detected 1p36 deletion, to fine-map the breakpoints

(Fig. 1B, left). Due to numerous sequence repeats in this
area, a portion of the deleted region was not covered by
the probes; however, the deletion spanned 224,674 bp containing the five genes identified in the MRD by array CGH
analysis (red/black/blue dots are data points representing
gain/neutral/loss status).
The MRD region was also examined with Affymetrix
mapping 500k SNP arrays to detect possible cnLOH using
27 selected cases with available matched germline DNA
(from the 141 cases used to determine the MRD). Six of the
27 cases (22.2%) showed cnLOH affecting chromosome arm
1p with an overlapping region of cnLOH of approximately
15Mb that included the 97-kb MRD identified by array
CGH (data not shown).
Methylation status of genes in the MRD
The methylation pattern of four of the five genes within
the MRD was investigated using the pyrosequencing technique (Fig. 2). Technical failures prevented the analysis of
LOC115110, likely owing to abundant sequence repeats in
the promoter region (see Fig. 2). A number of samples were
not investigated because of the lack of available tumor DNA.

Figure 2. Methylation analysis. Six specimens (T1–T6) without 1p36 deletions (1p36 del−), five specimens (T7–T11) with 1p36 cnLOH, and 14 specimens
(T12–T25) with 1p36 deletions (1p35 del+) were examined. The number of CpGs analyzed is indicated beside each gene. The percent methylation is

The number of CpG dinucleotides analyzed at each gene promoter is indicated beside each gene in Fig. 2. The percent
methylation of each CpG is presented both numerically
and by color coding (with yellow being the least methylated,
green being intermediate, and blue being highly methylated).
None of the genes examined showed a differential methylation pattern among (a) six cases without array CGH–detected
1p36 deletion (1p36 del−), (b) five cases with cnLOH (1p36
cnLOH), and (c) 14 cases with 1p36 deletion (1p36 del+;
P > 0.05, one-way ANOVA).
Identification of somatic mutations in TNFRSF14
Exon sequencing of the five genes identified within the
MRD was performed on 11 cases: 5 cases with and 6 cases
without deletion of 1p36 as determined by array CGH
analysis. We searched for somatic mutations in the sequence
data from the lymphoma cells by comparison with constitutional DNA obtained from peripheral blood lymphocytes
from the same patient. The exons and exon/intron boundaries for HES5 (exons 1–3), LOC115110 (exons 1 and 2),
TNFRSF14 (exons 1–8), C1orf93 (exons 1–7), and MMEL1
(exons 18–23) were studied. Exons 1 to 17 and 24 of MMEL1
could not be covered by PCR amplicons owing to high content of GC repeats; therefore, the existence of mutations in
these exons cannot be excluded. Of the five genes, only
TNFRSF14 displayed somatic mutations. Four somatic mutations were found in the tumor DNA from three of the five
cases with 1p36 deletion. One case had an A > G transition
in exon 1 resulting in an amino acid change from methionine
to valine, plus a synonymous change from G > A also in exon
1. Another case had a G > T transversion in exon 2 resulting
in truncation. The last case had a G > A transition in the first
base of intron 4. There were no somatic mutations detected
in the six cases without a 1p36 deletion.
Validation of TNFRSF14 mutation frequency and
correlation with inferior prognosis
To determine the frequency of TNFRSF14 mutation and to
undertake clinical correlative analysis, we selected 115 cases
with sufficient DNA from our 141 discovery cohort (used in

9170

Cancer Res; 70(22) November 15, 2010

determining the MRD and for which 1p36 deletion status was
known) plus 136 additional FL specimens from our archive in
which 1p36 deletion status was not known, totaling 251 primary FL cases. The clinical features and mutation findings
for these cases are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.
Briefly, in 46 cases (18.3%), we identified a total of 47 previously undescribed nonsynonymous mutations in TNFRSF14
after screening to exclude known polymorphic variants using
several databases including NCBI dbSNP Build 130 (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/), J. Craig Venter HuRef
Genome Browser (http://huref.jcvi.org/), James Watson Genotype Viewer (http://jimwatsonsequence.cshl.edu/cgi-perl/
gbrowse/jwsequence/), and the 1000 Genomes Project
(http://www.1000genomes.org/page.php). The 47 nonsynonymous mutations included 22 transitions, 13 transversions,
8 deletions, and 4 insertions resulting in 16 truncations
and 10 frameshifts (Table 2). All exons except 7 and 8 were
affected by mutations. One case showed two mutations in
TNFRSF14.
On examination of the relationship between 1p36 deletion
and TNFRSF14 mutation among the 114 cases whose deletion
status and mutation status were known, we found that
8 cases (7%) were positive for both 1p36 deletion and
TNFRSF14 mutation, 10 cases (8.8%) were TNFRSF14 mutation positive and 1p36 deletion negative, and 23 cases
(20.2%) were 1p36 deletion positive and TNFRSF14 mutation
negative. The clinical effect of these findings is presented
below. Furthermore, we found that among the 35 cases with
paired specimens taken at diagnosis and later at the time of
development of transformed DLBCL, a TNFRSF14 mutation
was detected in both samples from five paired specimens
and in two of the transformed samples whose corresponding
prior FL samples had no mutation.
Analysis of clinical correlation with TNFRSF14 mutations
in an expanded cohort of 251 cases revealed that TNFRSF14
mutations were associated with high-risk clinical features
(see Table 1). Specifically, patients with mutated TNFRSF14
were more likely to have a poor performance status, and
their FL involved a greater number of extranodal sites. When
patients whose overall treatment included rituximab were

analyzed, inferior OS and disease-specific survival (DSS) were
observed in those with a mutation in TNFRSF14 (median of
3.73 and 7.52 years, respectively) compared with those without (median of 15.85 and 15.85 years; log-rank test, P < 0.001

and P = 0.004, respectively; Fig. 3A and B). On multivariate
analysis using Cox regression, TNFRSF14 mutation emerged
as a stronger predictor of inferior OS and DSS after adjustment for the IPI in rituximab-treated patients {hazard ratios

TNFRSF14 Mutations in Follicular Lymphoma

or cases without any mutation but in whom the 1p36 deletion status was unknown (“no mut/del NA”; median not

Discussion
Based on microarray-based copy number and cnLOH data
analyses, we have identified a MRD at chromosome band
1p36 in FL that measures approximately 97 kb. This region
contains five genes: HES5, LOC115110, TNFRSF14, C1orf93,
and MMEL1. Direct DNA sequencing of the exons of these
genes in the 11 cases with matching tumor and constitutional DNA revealed that only TNFRSF14 was affected by
acquired somatic mutations in the clonal cells. In the cohort
of 251 cases where matching constitutional DNA was not
examined, 47 nonsynonymous mutations were detected in
46 cases (18.3%; after elimination of known polymorphic
variants). Although the mutations detected in the 251 case
study were not definitively confirmed to be somatic by parallel constitutional DNA sequencing, the lack of similar mutations in large public genomic databases and the significant
correlation of these observed mutations with inferior clinical
outcomes provide strong evidence that these mutations are
somatic in nature and that TNFRSF14 is the target gene in
the 1p36 MRD.
In the clinical correlative analysis of the 251-patient cohort, we report three interesting observations. First, patients
with TNFRSF14 mutations were more likely to have high-risk
clinical features such as poor performance status and involvement of multiple extranodal sites. Second, TNFRSF14
mutation alone or combined with 1p36 deletion correlated
with inferior prognosis. Third, the adverse effect of TNFRSF14
mutation on FL patients was independent of rituximab treatment. The implications of these findings are of clinical significance. Essentially, there seems to be a dose effect where
homozygosity for a somatic TNFRSF14 gene defect (deletion
plus mutation) was correlated with the poorest clinical
outcomes. In addition, treatment with rituximab conferred
less-than-expected benefit in patients with a mutation in
TNFRSF14. Furthermore, our observation that TNFRSF14
mutations were detected in both the paired diagnostic and
transformed specimens or only in transformed specimens
suggests that TNFRSF14 mutation may play a role in transformation of FL to DLBCL.
The TNFRSF14 gene is located on the chromosome 1 minus DNA strand from base pairs 2,479,150 to 2,486,757 and
is composed of eight exons, which together produce an
RNA transcript 1,731 bp in size and a protein product
consisting of 283 amino acids. The significance of such acquired mutations on the structure-function relationship of
TNFRSF14 is unclear; however, a previous study has found
that alterations of amino acid residues at positions 14, 23,

www.aacrjournals.org

and 26 (corresponding to exons 1, 1, and 2, respectively)
significantly reduce its binding affinity to BTLA, one of
the protein ligands for TNFRSF14 in negatively modulating
T-cell immune responses (20). Of interest in light of this
report, we found one case with a frameshift mutation
corresponding to amino acid position 14, another frameshift
mutation corresponding to position 23, and a nonsynonymous mutation corresponding to position 26. Among the
mutations detected in TNFRSF14, we found an exon-intron
junction alteration. Because TNFRSF14 can produce 15 different splice variants, alterations at splice sites will likely
disrupt their recognition by the transcription machinery,
leading to introns not being removed from the pre-mRNA
and/or frameshifts (21, 22). In vitro investigation will be
needed to further examine the effect of mutations on cellular function in different parts of the gene. Furthermore, CpG
methylation analysis of the five genes in the MRD showed
that acquired methylation was unlikely to be a mechanism
involved in the transcriptional silencing of TNFRSF14.
In conclusion, we have identified a MRD at 1p36 that
encompasses five genes, of which only TNFRSF14 (also
called HVEA, HVEM, ATAR, TR2, or LIGHTR) is associated
with FL based on the presence of somatic mutations and
the observation that FL patients with TNFRSF14 mutation
alone or combined with a 1p36 deletion have an inferior
prognosis. To the best of our knowledge, no other studies
have been able to provide strong evidence for a candidate
gene in the 1p36 deleted region in FL. Although the physiologic role of TNFRSF14 in humans is still being deciphered, recent evidence indicates that in addition to
being a member of the TNF receptor superfamily, normal
TNFRSF14 is capable of inhibiting the proliferation of adenocarcinoma cells and enhancing Fas-induced apoptosis
in non–Hodgkin's lymphoma cells, suggesting a tumor
suppressor role (23, 24). Functional analysis of this gene,
specifically the effect of mutations on the function of
TNFRSF14, is the subject of ongoing investigations. The
identification of TNFRSF14 as a candidate gene in the second most frequently altered region in the FL genome will
not only open the possibility of it being developed as a
prognostic marker for identifying high-risk patients as candidates for risk-adapted therapies, but TNFRSF14 may also
provide pharmacologic clues on why rituximab treatment
in some cases of FL may have a less-than-expected beneficial effect on survival.
