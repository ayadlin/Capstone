Abstract
Although ovarian cancer is a highly chemosensitive disease, it is only infrequently
cured. One of the major reasons lies in the presence of drug-resistant cancer stemlike cells, sufficient to fuel recurrence. We phenotyped cancer stem-like cells by
flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry in 55 matched samples before and after
taxane/platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. All used markers of stemness
(ALDH1, CD24, CD117, CD133) isolated low frequencies of malignant cells. ALDH1
was the most valuable marker for tracking stemness in vivo. The enrichment of ALDH1
expression after treatment was associated with a poor response to chemotherapy,
with platinum resistance and independently prognosticated unfavorable outcome. Our
results suggest that increased ALDH1 expression after treatment identifies patients
with aggressive tumor phenotypes.

Introduction

and taxane/platinum-based chemotherapy, more than 70%
of patients experience relapse and eventually succumb to
the disease.
Different factors have been shown to contribute
to treatment failure in cancer. Among these, cancer stem
cells (CSCs), cancer-/tumor-initiating cells (CICs, TICs;
from this point onward referred to as CSCs) or cancer
stem-like cells (CSLCs; from this point onward referred
to as CSCs) came into the focus of interest during the
last decade. Solid tumors are known to be composed of
different cell populations, of which one, in contrast to
cancer cells with a limited proliferative potential, is able
to self-renew and to maintain the tumor [5]. The existence
of these slow-dividing immortal cells explain why current
anti-cancer agents are effective in reducing the tumor mass
but by selecting for oncogenic resistance only infrequently
cure the patient [6, 7]. CSCs rely on a network of highly
conserved embryonic signaling pathways, including

Despite being the second most common malignancy
of the female genital tract in developed countries, epithelial
ovarian cancer (EOC) is the leading cause of death from
all gynecologic tumors and the fifth most lethal type of
cancer in women. Over the past two decades the median
survival has improved due to more aggressive surgical
techniques [1] and optimized combinations of cytotoxic
drugs [2, 3] but the long-term cure rate remains as low
as 30%. Thus, with an age-standardized mortality rate of
5.1/100.000 person-years EOC has significant implications
for public health and social costs [4]. A major reason for
this high death toll is the development of chemoresistance
in the course of the disease and especially platinumresistant disease is uniformly fatal. Even though a first
complete clinical and pathological remission is achieved
in at least 50% of these women with cytoreductive surgery

Notch, Hedgehog and Wnt, which are vital for selfpropagation. CSCs also exhibit resistance to treatment
with genotoxic agents mainly due to active DNA repair
machinery, the expression of ATB-binding cassette (ABC)
drug transporters and resistance to apoptosis [8].
CSCs have been isolated from multiple cancer
entities and correlated to therapeutic resistance and poor
prognosis [9]. Depending on the tumor context various
markers have been suggested to be useful to identify CSCs
but a single universal indicator has not been discovered
yet. In fact, its existence is questionable given CSC
phenotype variations both among tumors and within a
tumor. Also for ovarian CSCs, a specific phenotype has
not been determined so far. Given the heterogeneity
of the tumor bulk in advanced stages it even seems
unlikely that one universal marker would be sufficient
to describe all ovarian CSCs. Candidate markers include
aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) [10-16], mucin-type
glycoprotein CD24 [17, 18], proto-oncoprotein CD117 or
c-Kit [19-21] and transmembrane glycoprotein CD133
[22].
Here, we used matched pairs of chemotherapy-naïve
tissue specimens taken at the time of diagnosis and taxane/
platinum-treated samples taken during radical interval
debulking surgery (IDS) to characterize residual tumor
cells that have survived chemotherapy using several wellcharacterized markers of stemness. These CSC populations
were then tested as predictors of chemotherapeutic

response and prognosticators of recurrence-free and
overall survival. The goal of our study was to provide the
rationale for the improvement of CSC-focused anticancer
strategies able to abrogate chemoresistance and thus to
improve outcome.

Results
CSCs are present in ascites of therapy-naïve EOC
patients as detected by flow cytometry
Advanced EOC is typically associated with ascites,
which is considered an adequate model for the tumor
and its microenvironment. We have previously identified
epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)+ EOC
cells as the second largest ascitic cellular population in
therapy-naïve women [23]. Based on this finding, we
determined the frequency of ascitic CSCs in the subset
of EpCAM+ EOC cells using previously reported markers
of tumorigenicity [24]. Two of these antigens (ALDH1,
CD24) were distributed in a nearly ubiquitous fashion
on cancer cells (Figure 1A). However, CSCs could be
differentiated from non-tumorigenic cells by their high
staining intensity. Accordingly, EOC cells were split into
high versus low ALDH1 and CD24 expression groups.
Other CSC phenotypes (CD117, CD133) were identified

by positive labeling in contrast to absent expression in
non-tumorigenic cells. The percentage of CSCs in ascites
varied between 0.12% and 36.1% (Figure 1B, Table 1).
We found that the quantities of ALDH1high, CD24high
and CD117+ CSCs were of similar magnitude while
the proportion of CD133+ CSCs was lower suggesting
phenotypic heterogeneity. Additionally, we performed a
comparative analysis of stemness antigen expression in
malignant and benign tissue and found that CSC-related
molecules are also distributed on selected normal cells
(Supplementary Figure S1). However, antigen signals on
immunocytes were always lower than those of CSCs.

analyses of solid tumors and ascites gave similar results
for the quantification of ALDH1high (p < 0.05), CD24high
(p < 0.04) and CD117+ (p < 0.02) CSCs indicating the
validity of both methods and the presence of ovarian CSCs
(Figure 2B). Only with regard to CD133+ the two methods
detected different frequencies presumably due to low
antigen expression.

CSC frequency in response to neoadjuvant
chemotherapy
In the next step we aimed to monitor the
proliferation of CSCs during the course of treatment.
The amount of CSCs before and after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy (NAC) was evaluated in paired tissue
specimens by immunohistochemistry (IHC). We were
able to isolate restricted subpopulations of cancerous
cells expressing stemness antigens in NAC-treated EOC
samples (Table 1). However, when evaluating all patients
together, no consistent pattern of change in response to
anticancer therapy was found (Figure 3A).

CSCs are present in solid therapy-naïve EOC
specimens as detected by immunohistochemistry
We screened solid tumors for the existence of
ovarian CSCs to provide a basis for the evaluation of the
tumoral response to chemotherapy. In accordance to our
flow cytometric data, the immunohistochemical approach
identified a small percentage of ALDH1high, CD24high,
CD117+ and CD133+ EOC cells (Figure 2A, Table 1). The

Chemoresistant disease is characterized by CSC
accumulation

populations were not associated with FIGO stage, tumor
grade or lymph node metastasis (Supplementary Figure
S2). Moreover, the number of cycles and the type of
chemotherapeutic agents had no influence on the CSC
count after NAC (data not shown).
Based on our observation that myeloid cells, which
are morphologically similar to malignant cells, express
ALDH1 (Supplementary Figure S1) the presence of
aldehyde dehydrogenases was evaluated in the canceradjacent stroma of post-NAC tissue. However, no
correlation of ALDH1+ monocytes/macrophages with
histopathological tumor regression was found (data not
shown) excluding a chemotherapy-mediated increase
in macrophages that might have been able to support
chemoresistance [25].

We then asked whether a distinct shift in the amount
of CSCs might differentiate chemotherapeutic responders
(Rs) from non-responders (NRs). To further test this theory
we correlated the change of CSC antigen expression levels
from pre- to post-treatment periods with histopathological
features of chemoresistance. Indeed, malignancies that
lacked signs of regression in response to NAC showed an
accumulation of ALDH1high CSCs (p < 0.02; Figure 3B);
CD24high, CD117+ and CD133+ tumor cell proportions,
however, were not informative for histopathological signs
of regression. Remarkably, in non-regressing tumors after
NAC the median of IHC-determined ALDH1 expression
increased 3-fold; in single cases the increase was even up
to 17-fold.
Further support for our data of CSC expansion in
chemoresistant tumors came from the observation that
ALDH1high CSCs enriched in platinum-resistant disease
(Table 2). Early relapse within 6 months of completing
chemotherapy was found to occur more frequently in
patients with elevated ALDH1high CSC quantities after
NAC. None of the other stemness antigens evaluated in
our study was found to be associated with the tumoral
response to platinum.
We then aimed to know whether CSC counts might
be already indicative of poor treatment response at initial
diagnosis. Frequencies of ALDH1high CSCs before and
after NAC in NRs and Rs were determined. No difference
in ALDH1high cell proportions was found in chemotherapynaïve women (Figure 3C). However, after NAC NRs
showed increased numbers of ALDH1high cells suggesting
that CSCs expanded at the expense of their chemosensitive
counterparts (p < 0.05).
Further association analysis of CSCs with clinical
parameters confirmed our theory that ALDH1 expression
is rather responsible for resistance to treatment than
for promoting the disease. In detail, ALDH1high cell

The increase of CSCs after NAC is indicative of
poor outcome
Having demonstrated that tumors that enrich
CSCs after NAC are characterized by chemoresistance,
we speculated that these malignancies exhibit a more
aggressive phenotype. Consequently, CSCs were analyzed
for their use as prognosticators of survival. The pre- to
post chemotherapeutic change of ALDH1high tumorigenic
cells was able to distinguish between recurrence-free
survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates relating
the accumulation of CSCs to an unfavorable outcome
(Figure 3D). Consistent with these results, univariate
Cox regression analysis identified an increase of ALDH1
expression after NAC as a risk factor of RFS and OS
(Table 3). In the multivariate model for OS the ALDH1
score remained significant. Fascinatingly, the presence
of ALDH1high CSCs increased the risk of death by 4.18
times, a hazard ratio (HR) comparable to that of high RCB
following cytoreductive surgery, which is known to be the
most important prognostic factor in EOC and thus served
as the gold standard.

Discussion

antigen expression levels. Consistent with published
reports we found low- and high-expressing cancer cells
with regard to ALDH1 [15, 16] and CD24 [30]; concerning
CD117 [31] and CD133 [13] only antigen-positive and
-negative cancer cells were observed. Our expression data
indicated that ALDH1, CD24 and CD117 are more robust
markers of stemness than CD133 since they appeared to
be informative in a higher number of tumors. Likewise, a
recent report considered CD133 only useful in a minority
of EOC patients [22]. Additionally, the application of
antibodies targeting different CD133 epitopes was shown
to result in distinct expression patterns assigning the
sparsest staining to the clone AC133, which was used in
our study [32].
The expression variability across individual CSC
antigens in our study was in accordance with other
reports suggesting that each marker detects a unique
rather than the same CSC population [33]. Cancerous
ALDH1 expression was the only marker in our study that
convincingly predicted the response to chemotherapy
and independently prognosticated disease outcome.
Also in breast cancer, ALDH1 has been proposed to be
the best marker of stemness since fewer cells with this
phenotype were required to engraft the disease in mice
[34]. ALDH1 is the predominant isoform of a family
of cytosolic enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of
intracellular aldehydes. It has been suggested to play a
drug-metabolizing role possibly protecting CSCs against
chemotherapy [35]. In our analysis, we used ALDH1
protein levels, which have been shown to be positively
associated with the enzyme activity [11]. An enrichment of
tumorous expression of ALDH1 after NAC was associated
with a poor chemotherapeutic response. Moreover, the

Despite initial excellent response rates to standard
treatment,recurrent disease is still the major cause
of mortality in EOC. We demonstrate that, although
chemotherapy eliminates most malignant cells, CSCs
defined by high ALDH1 activity are left behind in
tumors with limited chemotherapeutic response and poor
prognosis indicating their pronounced ability to re-initiate
cancer.
It is generally accepted that progenitor cells
are present in the tumor mass of EOC [26, 27]. In the
stochastic model of cancer development treatment failure
results from the clonal selection of tumor cells, which
acquire genetic and epigenetic alterations during therapy
consequently reducing their sensitivity to antineoplastic
drugs. In contrast, the CSC hypothesis suggests that
a small fraction of cells is intrinsically resistant to
chemotherapy and gives rise to tumor recurrence due to
preferential proliferation. Consistent with this theory and
according to previous publications, we isolated cancerous
subpopulations of cells phenotypically resembling CSCs
[11, 13, 18]. To enrich for tumor cells we utilized the
antigen EpCAM, which has also been observed to be
upregulated on CSCs and appeared itself to be an indicator
of stem-like features [28]. The combinational use of
EpCAM and other CSC-related markers has been found to
improve the detection of stem-like cells [29]. Accordingly,
ovarian stem-like cells have been characterized previously
by their concomitant expression of EpCAM and ALDH1,
CD24, CD117 or CD133 [11, 16, 18]. We distinguished
tumorigenic from non-tumorigenic cells by their CSCwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

accumulation of ALDH1high CSCs correlated with platinum
resistance. Thus, ALDH1 appears to play a significant role
in platinum sensitivity, which is vital for the prognosis of
EOC patients. In line with these results, carboplatin was
shown to enrich ALDH1+ CSCs in residual tumors in a
xenograft mouse model of EOC [36]. Additionally, several
authors have reported an ALDH1 resistance to taxane and
platinum in vitro [11-13, 15].
According to these data of treatment resistance,
ALDH1 served also as a prognostic marker associated
with poor clinical outcome. Multivariate analysis
identified the accumulation of ALDH1high CSCs in the
course of treatment as an independent prognostic factor for
OS but not for RFS. ALDH1 staining intensity has been
found to be predictive of response to treatment, which
might affect not only initial but also relapse therapy. Thus,
patients with low counts of ALDH1high cells benefit from
each cycle of chemotherapy and consequently exhibit a
higher cumulative survival. Alternatively, the difference
might be due to non-tumor-related factors influencing
survival or to a more accurate assessment of death
compared to that of recurrence. Also other authors have
associated a high percentage of ALDH1+ EOC cells in
non-treated patients with short survival times [11-13, 15,
16]. However, our results show for the first time that NAC
in EOC selects for ALDH1high CSCs, which intensifies
the association of CSCs with poor survival. An increase
of ALDH1 expression after NAC identifies tumors with
intrinsically aggressive phenotypes. Consistent to our data,
ALDH1+ cells after NAC in breast cancer but not ALDH1
expression at initial diagnosis influenced prognosis [37].
In advanced EOC, NAC followed by IDS results
in comparable HRs for death and progressive disease
compared to primary cytoreductive surgery [38].
Benefits of NAC include lower rates of perioperative
morbidity, early identification of NRs and evaluation
of chemotherapy-induced bystander immune effects
[39, 40]. However, critics have expressed concern that
NAC, unlike primary surgical treatment, may select for
chemoresistant CSCs. Indeed, our results indicated an
enrichment of CSCs after NAC. We showed, however,
that only a subpopulation of patients is affected. Thus, the
analysis of cancerous ALDH1 expression at the time of
IDS may identify women, who are candidates for extended
treatment including CSC-targeted agents. For instance,
Metformin has been shown to be efficient in inhibiting
growth and proliferation of ALDH1+ CSCs both in vitro
and in vivo [41]. Additionally, clinical trials for the ALDH
inhibitor disulfiram have been initiated [42]. Also the
pretreatment with gold nanoparticles was found to be
promising to reduce acquired platinum-associated stemlike properties [43].
A potential limitation of our study was the use of
different tissue types for comparison of chemo-naïve with
NAC-treated CSCs. Different findings indicate that signals
of the microenvironment are able to modulate the profile
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of CSCs [5]. However, one recent study demonstrated
that frequencies of equally defined CSCs in the primary
tumor and intraperitoneal metastases are comparable
suggesting amount and characteristics are intrinsic
properties [44]. Another restriction of our findings is the
lack of experimental validation of stem-like cell behavior.
However, other authors have convincingly shown
that ALDH1+ EOC cells have the ability to engraft in
immunodeficient mice and when propagated recapitulate
their original tumor phenotype [11-13, 15, 16].
In conclusion, the key contribution of our analysis
is to better understand the evolution of resistance
mechanisms under the selective pressure of chemotherapy
in vivo. For patients with high amounts of ALDH1high
CSCs after NAC our study demonstrated an elevated
risk of poor outcome. Thus, we suggest ALDH1 to be a
pivotal marker in EOC that may improve the accuracy of
clinical outcome predictions and the choice of appropriate
treatment.

Materials and Methods
Patients and specimen
The study population consisted of a retrospective
sample of 55 patients with advanced EOC (serouspapillary, FIGO stage IIIC/IV) diagnosed at the University
of Bonn between 2002 and 2012. Patients were treated with
neoadjuvant chemotherapy under clinical trial conditions
[2] or because they were considered to be poor candidates
for upfront primary cytoreductive surgery [45]. Clinical
information was obtained from medical records; follow-up
data were updated until July 2014. After approval of the
Institutional Review Board the following matched pairs of
histological sections were selected for morphological and
immunohistochemical analysis: tumor tissue obtained at
the time of initial diagnosis by laparoscopy from therapynaïve patients, tumor tissue collected at the time of IDS
after NAC. Histopathological diagnosis was determined
based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria,
tumor grade on Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)
criteria. The International Federation of Gynecology and
Obstetrics (FIGO) system was used to assign the tumor
stage. According to the National Comprehensive Cancer
Network (NCCN) guidelines residual disease < 1cm
defines optimal cytoreduction [45]. In Europe, since 2010
the term ‘optimal cytoreduction’ is reserved for women
with no macroscopic residual disease (NRD) [46]. In
our study, we favored NCCN guidelines due to the high
number of women (44.80%) treated in the years before
2010. Patient baseline characteristics are listed in Table 1.

Assessment of chemotherapy response

account for different quantities of viable tumor in nonand NAC-treated tissue samples the amount of vital tumor
was morphologically determined and clustered as follows:
100%, > 50%, < 50%, 0% of vital tumor. For statistical
analysis these quantities were set to 1, 0.75, 0.25 and 0.05
representing the mean of the intervals and accounting for
non-observed vital cells in the last group. Expressions
of stemness antigens are given as semiquantitative
immunoreactivity scores normalized by the amount of
vital tumor (relative immunoreactivity score, denoted
as IRS). ALDH1 staining intensity was also recorded
for stromal cells adjacent to the cancer using criteria
mentioned above.

Histopathological criteria are considered the gold
standard to differentiate between chemotherapeutic Rs
and NRs. Therefore, the morphological response to
chemotherapy was assessed by an extensive evaluation of
all specimens taken at the time of IDS [47, 48]. According
to published criteria, samples with no residual tumor or
marked signs of tumor regression were categorized as
histopathological Rs; samples with no signs of tumor
regression or minimal regressive changes in < 50% of
tumor cells were classified as NRs [39, 49]. Additionally,
relapse-free intervals were determined for the analysis
of treatment response to platinum-containing regimen.
Disease that recurred within 6 months of completing
chemotherapy was defined platinum-resistant; disease that
relapsed within 6-12 months was considered intermediate
and disease that relapsed after a 12-month interval was
considered highly sensitive to platinum [50].

Flow cytometry
Ascites was collected at the time of initial diagnosis
in a subset of 15 patients. Primary antibodies are provided
in Supplementary Table S1, secondary antibodies in
Supplementary Table S2. Data were obtained on a LSR
II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) evaluating at least
100.000 events per sample after excluding debris and
doublets. Benign cells expressing CSC-related antigens
were excluded from flow cytometric analysis by electronic
gating. ALDH1 was stained intracellularly using the
Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences). Analysis
was performed by FlowJo software (TreeStar, Olten,
Switzerland).

Immunohistochemistry
Areas of EOC were identified in sections stained
with hematoxylin and eosin. IHC of ALDH1, CD24 [51]
and CD117 was performed on 2-3µm formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded tissue specimens using an automated
staining system (Medac 480 S Autostainer; Medac,
Wedel, Germany). The reaction was developed with
HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse/rabbit/rat IgG and the
DAB system (Medac). CD133 IHC was carried out on the
Ventana BenchMark Ultra (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)
using Ventana OptiView reagents and the DAB detection
kit. Supplementary Table 1 reports the antibodies used for
IHC.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS
version 21 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA) and ‘R’
version 2.15.1 (The R Foundation for Statistical
Computing, Vienna, Austria). Fold change (FC) was
defined as the ratio of the IRS in pre-NAC samples to that
in post-NAC tissue. Due to our inability to enumerate all
tumor cells in a patient a pseudocount of one was added to
all IRS values to account for unobserved immunopositive
cells [54]. The median was used as a cut-off point to
assign tumors into high and low ALDH1, CD24, CD117
and CD133 reactivity groups. Comparisons between
continuous data were carried out using the Mann-Whitney
U and the Kruskal-Wallis test; comparisons between
categorical variables were performed using the chisquare test; p-values for tests with only a small number of
counts were computed based on Monte Carlo simulations
using 1.000.000 replicates. Cumulative survival analysis
was performed using Kaplan-Meier method; curves
were compared with log-rank test. Multivariate survival
analysis was performed using the Cox’s proportional
hazard regression model. The median follow-up time was
calculated by reverse Kaplan-Meier estimator [55]. Results
with a p-value < 0.05 were considered to be significant.

Evaluation of immunoreactions
Immunostained cells were analyzed with a Leica
DM LB2 microscope (Leica Microsystems Wetzlar
GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). To minimize interobserver
variability all specimens were analyzed by the same
person (B.R.) in a blinded fashion. ALDH1 was considered
positive when the cytoplasm showed a positive reaction
[11]; for CD24 total staining was determined [51]; CD117
was scored as positive if the staining was localized to the
cell membrane and cytoplasm simultaneously [52]; for
CD133 cell membrane labeling was regarded positive
[53]. Tumoral expression of ALDH1, CD24, CD117
and CD133 was assessed using a semiquantitative
immunoreactivity score ranging from 0 (negative) to 12
(strongly positive), calculated as the product of staining
intensity (0 = no staining; 1 = weak staining; 2 = moderate
staining; 3 = intense staining) and staining area (0 = 0%;
1 = < 10%; 2 = 11-50%; 3 = 51-80%; 4 = 81-100%). To
