Abstract
Although chemokine and growth factor receptors are attractive and popular targets for cancer therapeutic intervention,
structure-based targeting of the ligands themselves is generally not considered practical. New evidence indicates that a
notable exception to this is macrophage migration inhibitory
factor (MIF). MIF, an autocrine- and paracrine-acting cytokine/growth factor, plays a pivotal role in both the initiation
and maintenance of neoplastic diseases. MIF possesses a
nonphysiologic enzymatic activity that is evolutionarily wellconserved. Although small molecule antagonists of MIFs
enzymatic active site have been reported to inhibit biological
activities of MIF, universally high IC50s have limited their
clinical appeal. Using a computational virtual screening
strategy, we have identified a unique small molecule inhibitor
that serves as a suicide substrate for MIF, resulting in the
covalent modification of the catalytically active NH2-terminal
proline. Our studies further reveal that this compound,
4-iodo-6-phenylpyrimidine (4-IPP), is f5 to 10 times more
potent in blocking MIF-dependent catalysis and lung adenocarcinoma cell migration and anchorage-independent growth
than the prototypical MIF inhibitor, ISO-1. Finally, using an
in silico combinatorial optimization strategy, we have
identified four unique congeners of 4-IPP that exhibit MIF
inhibitory activity at concentrations 10 to 20 lower than
that of parental 4-IPP. [Cancer Res 2008;68(18):7253–7]

Introduction
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic
cytokine/growth factor that contributes to inflammatory, autoimmune, and malignant disease pathologies. MIF exerts at least some
of its biological actions through binding to its extracellular cognate
receptor complex consisting of CD74 and CD44 (1, 2). Studies from
this laboratory have revealed a requirement for extracellular MIF in
the steady-state activation of Rho GTPase family members, leading
to cell growth and migratory phenotypes (3, 4). These MIFmediated effects are thought to be linked to CD74/CD44-initiated
signaling given the fact that CD44-dependent signaling has been
shown to promote Rho GTPase family member activation (5).

MIF possesses the unusual ability to catalyze the tautomerization of the nonphysiologic substrates D-dopachrome and
L-dopachrome methyl ester into their corresponding indole
derivatives (6). The NH2-terminal proline of MIF (Pro-1) seems to
be a critical residue for enzymatic activity, as site-directed
mutagenesis that substitutes a serine or glycine for this proline
(P1G) is devoid of tautomerase activity (7). The physiologic role of
MIFs catalytic activity remains in question, however, because of
conflicting reports of loss or gain of biological activity with various
proline mutants (7, 8).
Of the MIF enzyme/biological antagonists reported, ISO-1 [S,R-3(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazole acetic acid methyl ester],
is the best characterized (9, 10). Although other compounds have
been shown to have improved biological inhibitory activities against
MIF (11, 12), ISO-1 is considered to be the prototypical MIF
antagonist. We and others have reported that this compound is as
effective in blocking MIF-dependent malignant phenotypes as MIF
knockdown by siRNA (4, 13).
We now report on a unique virtual screening strategy that
identified a novel suicide substrate for MIF. Our studies indicate
that this compound is f5 to 10 more potent than the best
known MIF inhibitor in blocking MIF-dependent catalysis,
migration and anchorage-independent growth.

Materials and Methods
Cells and reagents. Human A549 lung adenocarcinoma (American Type
Culture Collection) cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FCS,
2 mmol/L glutamine, and 50 Ag/mL gentamicin (Invitrogen). RNA
interference transfections, migration assays, and soft agar colony formation
experiments were performed as previously described (4). Candidate MIF
inhibitor compounds were purchased from Chemnavigator, 4-iodo-6phenylpyrimidine (4-IPP) was purchased from Specs, 6-phenylpyrimidine
was from Sigma-Aldrich, and ISO-1 was a generous gift from Dr. Yousef
Al-Abed (Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, NY).
Virtual screening. SDF-formatted files from the ACD (MDL) library were
transformed using Genfra (Accelrys), obtaining a library of 343,802
structures suitable for the virtual screening software Ludi (Accelrys). Ludi
considers hydrogen bond donors and acceptors and aliphatic nature
(variables: 8-Å radius with no linkage, or rotatable bonds, 5,000 fits, 300
lowest hits to be stored, aliphatic_aromatic, and electrostatic_check
options). The first three energy functions were used and a manual
consensus score ranked the lists.
Enzymatic analyses. MIF enzymatic activity in cell lysates and liver
tissue was carried out by lysing 1  107 A549 cells or f1 gram pieces of
liver in PBS containing 1 mmol/L NaVO4, 2 mmol/L NaF, and a protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche Biochemical) using dounce homogenization on
ice. rMIF (14), cell lysate, or liver lysate was added to a final volume of
700 AL PBS in plastic cuvettes. For rMIF inhibition assays, compounds
were added to the rMIF/PBS solution and preincubated for 5 min.

Cancer Research
L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine methyl ester (4 mmol/L) and 8 mmol/L
sodium periodate (Sigma-Aldrich) were combined in a 3:2 ratio to form
L-dopachrome methyl ester. L-dopachrome methyl ester (300 AL) was then
immediately added to the cuvettes, incubated for an additional 5 min to
allow color change, which was measured at OD 475 nm.
Crystallization and structure determination. Recombinant MIF
protein (0.1 mmol/L; ref. 9) was mixed with a 10-fold molar excess of
4-IPP, incubated over night, and concentrated to 1 mmol/L protein with a
Centricon 3000 M.W. centrifugal filter unit (Millipore). The complex was
crystallized using the hanging drop vapor-diffusion method at 20jC. Equal
volumes of the MIF inhibitor complex and reservoir solution [2 mol/L
ammonium sulfate, 4% isopropanol, and 0.1 mol/L tris (pH 7.5)] were mixed
to form 2 AL drops. Crystals belonging to space group P212121 formed
within 2 wk. Data were collected in house using a Rigaku RAXIS-IV imaging
plate area detector. The crystal was cryoprotected in the reservoir solution
containing 25% glycerol. Diffraction data were collected at 180jC, and
HKL2000 (15) was used to integrate and scale the diffraction data to 1.8 Å.
The structure was solved by molecular replacement with Phaser (16) using
the structure of MIF in complex with Oxim-11 as search model (11).
Refinement was performed using CNS and Refmac (17, 18), and manual
manipulation of the model was done using MIFit 4.1. The structure is
deposited with the RCSB Protein Data Bank and has been assigned the
RCSB ID code RCSB045257 and PDB ID code 3B9S.
Mass spectroscopy. MIF/4-IPP adducts were analyzed by liquid
chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Samples were run on a C18
(Waters) column attached to an HP1100 LC with auto sampler and Diode
Array UV detector (Agilent Technologies) coupled to a Micromass Quattro
LCZ (Waters Corp.) triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, using the
electrospray ion source. The LC method used a reversed phase gradient,
10% to 60% acetonitrile, and the mass spectrometer was set up in the
electrospray positive-ion mode to scan over the range M/z 200 to 1,000. LC
peaks containing consecutive M/z scans were combined to produce mass
spectra of the analyte, consisting of a series of multiply-charged ions of the
intact protein. Spectra were further analyzed using MaxEnt1 feature of
MassLynx (Waters Corp.) to determine mass of the proteins from the
multiply-charged series of ions.

spectrophotometrically at OD475.

Results and Discussion
Virtual screening against Met-2 of MIF reveals a novel small
molecule inhibitor of MIF. As opposed to prior virtual screens
run against MIF that targeted the NH2-terminal proline, our
computational screening strategy focused on targeting methionine
at position A2 (A2 refers to monomer A, position 2 from the
trimeric crystal structure of MIF). We chose this strategy because
(a) Met-2 resides at the base of the hydrophobic binding pocket,
whereas the NH2-terminal proline is situated on the side of the
pocket (19); and (b) prior studies have shown that disrupting this
hydrophobic substrate–binding pocket by insertion of a single
amino acid residue adjacent to Met-2 leads to a complete loss of
enzymatic and biological activity (9).
Our initial virtual screen used the crystal structure of MIF (PDB1MIF) and the Available Chemicals Directory library, the results of
which provided a ranking list of the top 100 compounds. Of the 76
commercially available compounds obtained from this list, only 41
were found to be soluble in aqueous solutions at 100 Amol/L
concentrations. Of these, 9 were found to be inhibitory at
concentrations of 50 Amol/L or less to the catalytic activity of
purified, recombinant MIF (22.0% success rate; 9 of 41). When these
compounds were tested against MIF-dependent catalytic activity in
whole cell lysates, we found that only three compounds remained
inhibitory at similar IC50s. Of these three remaining compounds,
only one was found to exhibit superior MIF catalytic inhibitory
activity versus ISO-1: 4-IPP (Fig. 1A). 4-IPP and ISO-1 were tested

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (18). September 15, 2008

for their relative inhibitory effects against the catalytic activity of
recombinant human MIF. As shown in Fig. 1B, the IC50 of 4-IPP is
10 times lower than that of ISO-1.
4-IPP is a suicide substrate for MIF. Because the kinetics
observed with 4-IPP against MIF catalysis were reminiscent of an
irreversible inhibitor (data not shown), we next tested MIF/4-IPP
admixtures to determine whether any shifts in the molecular
weight of MIF were observable. As shown in Fig. 2A (top), LC-MS
analysis revealed that MIF coincubated with 4-IPP resulted in a
mass increase of 154 units. Coincubation of 4-IPP with a
catalytically inactive mutant of MIF (point mutation of Pro-1 to
Gly-1; ref. 7), resulted in no covalent modification as assessed by
mass spectroscopy (Fig. 2A, bottom).
Cocrystallization of MIF and 4-IPP reveals 6-phenylpyrimidine covalently modified catalytic proline. Because 4-IPP is
M.W. 282 and the iodine at position 4 of the pyrimidine ring can
act as a leaving group, we suspected that the increase in mass of
154 units observed with wild-type rMIF/4-IPP (but not catalytically
inactive mutants) was due to a covalent modification of rMIF by
deiodinated 4-IPP giving 6-phenylpyrimidine–modified MIF (M.W.
156; with covalent attachment, M.W. 154). To test this, we
performed cocrystalization of MIF/4-IPP admixtures. As shown in
Fig. 2B, 4-IPP binds covalently to MIF at the nitrogen of the NH2terminal proline by substitution of the iodo group at the 4-position
of 4-IPP (data collection details are found in Supplementary

Table S1). The phenyl substituent is oriented deep in the MIF
catalytic pocket near Met-2 (Fig. 2C). This is similar to existing
crystal structures of MIF with antagonists 7-hydroxy-2-oxochromene-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (20) and OXIM6 (PDB
entries 1GCZ and 2OOZ, respectively; ref. 11), although the phenyl
substituent of bound 4-IPP is located slightly deeper into the
binding pocket and in a different orientation. There is some
apparent freedom of rotation of the phenyl ring as two different
conformations exist in the trisubstituted trimeric MIF crystal
structure. The major interaction partners for bound 4-IPP within
2.5 Å are MET A2,TYR A36, HIS A62, VAL A106, PHE A113, TYR B95,
and ASN B97.
Inhibition of MIF-dependent migration and anchorage
independence by 4-IPP. Studies from this (4) and other
laboratories (13) reveal that ISO-1 effectively inhibits MIFdependent cell migration and anchorage-independent growth in
human cancer cell lines. As such, we tested 4-IPP against ISO-1 and
determined the relative inhibitory effects on the migration of A549
lung adenocarcinoma cells on collagen substrates. Consistent with
our recent findings, MIF siRNA strongly reduced the migration of
A549 cells (Fig. 3A; ref. 4). Similar to MIF siRNA, pretreatment of
A549 cells with either ISO-1 or 4-IPP at 100 Amol/L reduced A549
motility by >70%. In contrast, 10 Amol/L (Fig. 3A) and 50 Amol/L
(data not shown) ISO-1 had no effect on A549 migration, whereas

10 Amol/L 4-IPP attenuated migration by >50% that of vehicle
alone (Fig. 3A). To ensure that this effect was not restricted to A549
cells, H1299 and H23 NSCLC cell lines showed a similar effect with
4-IPP albeit more pronounced (Supplementary Fig. S1). Interestingly, both of these cell lines were largely resistant to ISO-1 at
100 Amol/L, whereas 4-IPP was maximally effective at this
concentration. As MIF is thought to promote non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) motility in a Rac1-dependent fashion, 4-IPP was
tested for its ability to block Rac1 binding to the PAK-binding
domain of Pak (PBD; ref. 4). As shown in Fig. 3B, 4-IPP reduced
Rac1 binding to PBD similar to what we have observed with siRNA
in the same cells.
We next tested and compared the relative efficacies of ISO-1 and
4-IPP to inhibit lung adenocarcinoma anchorage-independent
growth. As shown in Fig. 3C, both ISO-1 and 4-IPP inhibited
A549 soft agar growth, but 4-IPP was between 5- to 10-fold more
potent (similar to IC50 data from Fig. 1A) than ISO-1.
We then tested in vivo inhibition of tissue-associated MIF by
4-IPP. Injections of 4-IPP (1 mg; f50 mg/kg) inhibited liver MIF
enzyme tautomerase activity at 6 hours or for 3 and 7 days (daily
injections of 1 mg 4-IPP) by >50% (Fig. 3D). Importantly, we
observed no weight loss or obvious toxicity with 1, 2, or 4 mg daily
i.p. injections (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, respectively) of 4-IPP over
the course of 7 days (Fig. 3D; data not shown). Although longer

swabbing, and the bottom of the membrane was stained, washed, solubilized with isopropanol, and read spectrophotometrically at OD570. Results are representative of
four independent experiments and were performed in duplicate. B, 4  105 A549 cells were treated in duplicate with 0.1% DMSO or 50 Amol/L 4-IPP in fresh medium

tissue, 500 Ag of total liver protein was assessed for L-dopachrome methyl ester tautomerase activity.

treatment regimens remain to be tested, acute toxicity of 4-IPP
seems to be nominal.
To identify more potent analogues of our lead MIF antagonist,
we performed an in silico combinatorial docking screen using the
cocrystal structure of the MIF:4-IPP complex defining MIF as the
receptor and the phenylpyrimidine rings of 4-IPP as the core. Four
unique congeners of 4-IPP were predicted to have substantially
increased binding potential within the MIF substrate binding
pocket. We subsequently synthesized the four analogues and, as
predicted, the IC50s of all four individual analogues were between
f10 and 20 more active (IC50s: A1, f200 nmol/L; A2, f275
nmol/L; A3, f400 nmol/L; A4, f475 nmol/L) than parental 4-IPP
in blocking MIF-dependent catalysis (Fig. 4A). Finally, to
determine if enhanced enzyme inhibitory activity correlates with
enhanced biological inhibitory activity, we tested the most potent
of the four analogues against 4-IPP in an in vitro migration assay.
As shown in Fig. 4B, A1-4-IPP was substantially more potent in
blocking migration than our lead parent compound, 4-IPP.

Characterization of a Novel MIF Suicide Antagonist

Using a novel virtual screening strategy, we have discovered a
family of suicide substrates of MIF that covalently modify the NH2terminal, catalytically active proline of MIF. Our results indicate
that 4-IPP is dehalogenated upon contact with enzymatically
active, but not inactive, MIF, and a subsequent covalent bond then
forms between C-4 of pyrimidine and the NH2-terminal nitrogen of
Proline at position 1. Importantly, this covalently modified MIF is
rendered inactive in both its catalytic and biological functions by
the suicide substrate, 4-IPP. Our studies further indicate that 4-IPP
treatment inhibits the migration and anchorage independence of
human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines in vitro and MIF-associated
liver enzyme activity when administered in vivo.
Several small molecule inhibitors of MIF have been described
since enzymatic activity of MIF was first discovered (9, 11, 12, 20).
Orita and colleagues (20) first described virtual screening as a tool
to identify novel small molecule antagonists of MIF. Using the
catalytically active NH2-terminal proline as a target, the authors
discovered that SBDD-identified MIF inhibitory compounds could
be classified into four independent groups. Despite excellent IC50
activities against MIF catalysis of lead compounds identified from
this study, no functional testing of these inhibitors has been
reported to date.
Our group and others have recently reported that ISO-1 blocks
the migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth of

human cancer cell lines (4, 13). As the MIF receptor CD74 has been
found to be necessary for antitumor activities of ISO-1, it is likely
that 4-IPP and its more active analogues similarly block MIF/
receptor interactions albeit more efficiently than ISO-1.
In summary, we have identified a unique family of small
compound inhibitors of MIF that act as suicide substrates to
irreversibly inhibit MIF-dependent tumor cell invasive and
anchorage-independent properties. Although further studies are
needed to elucidate the antitumor efficacy of this novel lead
compound, we propose that 4-IPP represents a unique class of antiMIF therapeutic antagonists.
