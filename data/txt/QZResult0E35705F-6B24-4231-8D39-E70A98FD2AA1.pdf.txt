Abstract
The precise role of transforming growth factor (TGF)-B
signaling in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
is not yet fully understood. Here, we report generation of an
inducible head- and neck-specific knockout mouse model by
crossing TGF-B receptor I (Tgfbr1) floxed mice with K14CreERtam mice. By applying tamoxifen to oral cavity of the
mouse to induce Cre expression, we were able to conditionally delete Tgfbr1 in the mouse head and neck epithelia. On
tumor induction with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene
(DMBA), 45% of Tgfbr1 conditional knockout (cKO) mice
(n = 42) developed SCCs in the head and neck area starting
from 16 weeks after treatment. However, no tumors were
observed in the control littermates. A molecular analysis
revealed an enhanced proliferation and loss of apoptosis in
the basal layer of the head and neck epithelia of Tgfbr1 cKO
mice 4 weeks after tamoxifen and DMBA treatment. The
most notable finding of our study is that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway was activated in SCCs that
developed in the Tgfbr1 cKO mice on inactivation of TGF-B
signaling through Smad2/3 and DMBA treatment. These
observations suggest that activation of Smad-independent
pathways may contribute cooperatively with inactivation of
Smad-dependent pathways to promote head and neck
carcinogenesis in these mice. Our results revealed the
critical role of the TGF-B signaling pathway and its crosstalk with the PI3K/Akt pathway in suppressing head and
neck carcinogenesis. [Cancer Res 2009;69(14):5918–26]

Introduction
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the
most common types of human cancer (1). Tobacco, alcohol consumption, and viral agents are the major risk factors for development of
HNSCC. These risk factors together with genetic susceptibility result
in the accumulation of multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations

in a multistep process of cancer development (2). However, the
underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms that contribute to
the initiation and progression from normal epithelia to invasive SCC
have not been clearly delineated (3).
There is accumulating evidence that suggests that the transforming growth factor (TGF)-h signal transduction pathway is
involved in head and neck carcinogenesis (4, 5). TGF-h is a
multifunctional cytokine with diverse biological effects on
cellular processes, including cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis. The three mammalian TGF-h isoforms,
TGF-h1, TGF-h2, and TGF-h3, exert their functions through a cell
surface receptor complex composed of type I (TGFBR1) and type II
(TGFBR2) serine/threonine kinase receptors. Intracellular signaling
is initiated once TGFBR1 has been phosphorylated by TGFBR2,
which in turn phosphorylates Smad2 or Smad3. Phosphorylated
Smad2 (p-Smad2) or Smad3 binds to Smad4, and then the complexes
translocate from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. This results in the
transcriptional activation of TGF-h–responsive genes that mediate
the effects of TGF-h at the cellular level. Independent of Smad
proteins, receptor activation also induces other downstream targets,
including Ras, RhoA, TAK1, MEKK1, phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K), and PP2A, to produce the full spectrum of TGF-h responses
(6–8).
The effects of TGF-h signaling in carcinogenesis largely depend
on the tissue of origin and the tumor type. In most types of human
cancer, TGF-h plays a paradoxical role in cancer development by
acting as a tumor suppressor in early stages (9) and a tumor
promoter in later stages (10, 11). In HNSCC, it is known that TGF-h
functions as a potent tumor suppressor (12). However, it is not
clear whether TGF-h acts in a pro-oncogenic manner in advanced
late-stage HNSCC. A human oral carcinoma cell line, which
contained a normal Ras but was growth inhibited by TGF-h1, led to
an increase in cell migration and invasion, and metastasis when
transfected with dominant-negative TGFBR2 (dn RII) cDNA (13).
When TGF-h receptor II (Tgfbr2) was conditionally deleted in mouse
head and neck epithelia, 35% of the 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene
(DMBA)–initiated Tgfbr2 / mice developed jugular lymph node
metastasis, suggesting that TGF-h may actually in fact suppress
metastasis rather than promote it (14).
The correlation between TGF-h receptor–mediated signaling
and cancer development has been studied extensively. However,
much less attention has been paid to the role of TGFBR1 in
carcinogenesis when compared with that of TGFBR2. Although
several reports have noted that mutations and polymorphisms of
TGFBR1 are associated with HNSCC (15–17), the precise molecular
nature of TGFBR1-mediated pro-oncogenic effects is still unknown.

Tgfbr1 and PI3K/Akt Pathway in HNSCC

In the current study, we conditionally deleted Tgfbr1 in mouse head
and neck epithelia using the Cre-LoxP approach to show that
deletion of Tgfbr1 alone is not sufficient for spontaneous tumor
formation, although it can increase the susceptibility to tumor
development initiated by DMBA. The most notable finding of our
study is that, in SCCs that developed in the Tgfbr1 conditional
knockout (cKO) mice, the PI3K/Akt pathway, one of the most
important Smad-independent receptor I signaling pathways, was
clearly activated in addition to inactivation of the Smad-dependent
TGF-h signaling pathway. Our studies identified the critical role of
the TGFBR1-mediated signaling pathway and its cross-talk with the
PI3K/Akt pathway in suppressing head and neck carcinogenesis. The
Tgfbr1 cKO mouse will be a valuable animal model for studying
genetic alterations and signaling pathways that play important roles
in HNSCC.

Materials and Methods
Generation of Tgfbr1 cKO mice. The Tgfbr1 cKO mice (K14CreERtam;Tgfbr1 f/f ) were generated from crosses between Tgfbr1f/f mice (mixed
genetic strains of C57BL/6, 129SV/J, and FVB/N; refs. 18, 19) and K14-CreERtam
mice (genetic strain CD-1; ref. 20). The Tgfbr1 cKO mice and their controls
(Tgfbr1f/f, Tgfbr1 f/ +, and K14-CreERtam;Tgfbr1 f/ + mice) were from the same
litter and therefore had exactly the same mixed genetic background. The
treatment procedures of tamoxifen and DMBA have been described (14, 20).
Additional details are provided in Supplementary Data.

Histology, immunostaining, and bromodeoxyuridine labeling. Immunohistochemical staining and quantifications of immunohistochemical
slides were performed using a previously published method (21). Intratumoral microvessel density (iMVD) was determined as previously described (22). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling and primary antibodies
are described in Supplementary Data.
Western blot analysis. Normal buccal mucosa and tongue from six pairs
of Tgfbr1f/f and Tgfbr1 cKO mice, together with tumors that developed in
DMBA-initiated Tgfbr1 cKO mice, were carefully dissected. A total amount
of 40 Ag protein from each sample was denatured and then loaded in each
lane of NuPAGE 4% to 12% Bis-Tris precast gel. Additional details are
provided in Supplementary Data.
Additional methods. Information on terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, Cre-mediated
recombination assessment, quantitative real-time PCR, and flow cytometry
analysis (23) is detailed in Supplementary Data.
Statistical analysis. Statistical differences in the levels of mRNA
expression between controls and experimental samples were determined
using the Student’s t test.

Results
Inducible deletion of Tgfbr1 in head and neck epithelia is
not sufficient for SCC formation in mice. We generated an
inducible head- and neck-specific knockout mouse model by crossing Tgfbr1 floxed mice with K14-CreERtam mice. K14 is expressed
in proliferating keratinocytes of the basal layer of the epidermis.

H, DMBA-treated Tgfbr1 cKO mice develop
SCCs more frequently than Tgfbr1 cKO mice. No
tumors were observed in K14-CreERtam;Tgfbr1 f/ + or
Tgfbr1f/f control littermates during 1 y of observation
after tamoxifen and DMBA treatment.

It is also active in stem cells that regenerate the epidermis,
sebaceous glands, hair follicles, and the oral mucosa. Therefore,
tamoxifen treatment causes permanent excision of Tgfbr1 in both
epithelia and epidermis of the head and neck region, including
buccal mucosa, tongue, and ears. The Tgfbr1 cKO mice and
controls (Tgfbr1f/f ) were dissected 10 days after tamoxifen
treatment. Genomic DNA was extracted from all major organs
and tissues. Cre-mediated recombination of the Tgfbr1f/f allele was
assessed using a PCR-based assay. Deletions of Tgfbr1 were
detected in the buccal mucosa, tongue, and ear but not in the
esophagus, forestomach, back skin, or any other nonstratified
epithelial organs of Tgfbr1 cKO mice (Supplementary Fig. S1). No
recombination was detected before tamoxifen administration.
Tgfbr1 mRNA expression was examined by quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). The expression levels of Tgfbr1
mRNA in Tgfbr1f/f mice were normalized as 1.00 F 0.23 in the
buccal mucosa and 1.00 F 0.08 in the tongue. The mRNA
expression levels were significantly reduced to a mean of 0.65 F
0.17 in the buccal mucosa (P < 0.01) and 0.07 F 0.05 in SCC of
Tgfbr1 cKO mice as well as 0.46 F 0.05 in the tongue (P < 0.001; Fig.
1A). Using immunostaining, the Tgfbr1 protein level was found to
be significantly decreased in the tongue of Tgfbr1 cKO mice
compared with that of Tgfbr1f/f mice. A similar decrease was also
observed in p-Smad2, an activated mediator of TGF-h signaling
(Fig. 1B ). However, the expression of both Tgfbr1 and p-Smad2
in the back skin of the same mice remained normal (data not
shown). This suggests that, on oral administration of tamoxifen,
the deletion of Tgfbr1 and the inactivation of its downstream
signaling were localized only in the head and neck epithelia.
These results were further confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 1C).

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (14). July 15, 2009

Of 31 Tgfbr1 cKO mice, only 3 (9.7%, 3 of 31) developed
spontaneous tumors, including 2 SCCs in the periorbital region
and 1 in the upper lateral neck. No significant pathologic changes
in the head and neck region were observed in the remaining
Tgfbr1 cKO mice during 1 year of observation. Thus, our results
indicate that inactivation of TGF-h signaling alone is not sufficient to promote tumor formation in head and neck epithelia of
these mice.
Deletion of Tgfbr1 in the head and neck epithelia together
with DMBA initiation-induced SCCs in mice. Because spontaneous tumor formation in Tgfbr1 cKO mice was rare, we induced
tumors in Tgfbr1 cKO mice by applying a single dose (50 Ag per
mouse) of DMBA to the mouse oral cavity 10 days after the last
tamoxifen treatment. DMBA is a commonly used chemical
carcinogen, which can induce H-ras mutations in sporadic cells
(24). After tumor initiation with DMBA, Tgfbr1 cKO mice started to
develop SCCs in the head and neck area as early as 16 weeks, and
by 1 year after treatment, 19 of 42 (45%) Tgfbr1 cKO mice had
developed SCCs. The sites of tumors that developed in DMBAtreated Tgfbr1 cKO mice included the oral cavity, periorbital region,
muzzle area, and skin around the head and neck area (Fig. 2A–E).
Sixteen percent (3 of 19) of mice with tumors had developed
metastases in the jugular lymph nodes and/or lungs by the time the
mice were dissected (10–12 months after tamoxifen and DMBA
treatment; Fig. 2F and G ). No tumors developed in the
heterozygous mice (K14-CreERtam;Tgfbr1 f/ +; n = 27) or the Tgfbr1
floxed homozygous (Tgfbr1f/f ; n = 34) control littermates (also
treated with tamoxifen and DMBA) during the same time period
(Fig. 2H). However, only partial excision of Tgfbr1 in mouse head
and neck epithelia was noted by immunohistochemistry and

Western blot due to relatively low efficiency of the tamoxifeninduced K14-CreERtam mouse line being used in this study (Fig. 1B
and C; ref. 20).
Enhanced cell proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, and
down-regulation of cell cycle inhibitors in the head and neck
epithelia of Tgfbr1 cKO mice. TGF-h has effects on both cell
growth and apoptosis. Four weeks after DMBA treatment, an
increased expression of a proliferative marker, Ki67, was detected
in the basal layer of the tongue of Tgfbr1 cKO mice but not in
Tgfbr1f/f mice. A decreased apoptosis was also observed, indicating
that the imbalance between cell proliferation and apoptosis occurs
early in the head and neck epithelia of Tgfbr1 cKO mice (Fig. 3A).
Using BrdUrd assays, we found a significantly increased number of
proliferative cells in Tgfbr1 cKO mice head and neck epithelia and
SCCs when compared with those of Tgfbr1f/f mice (Fig. 3B).
However, we did not observe any apoptotic cells in SCCs by TUNEL
assays (data not shown). Immunostaining revealed that CDKN1A
expression was reduced in tongue and SCCs of Tgfbr1 cKO mice
compared with that in Tgfbr1f/f mice. In contrast, c-Myc was

overexpressed in tongue of Tgfbr1 cKO mice and its expression was
even more remarkable in SCCs (Fig. 3B). These results were
further confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3C). Our results
indicate the existence of an imbalance between cell proliferation,
differentiation, and apoptosis in SCCs that developed in Tgfbr1
cKO mice as well as in normal Tgfbr1 cKO mice head and neck
epithelia.
Enhanced paracrine effect of TGF-B on tumor stroma of
Tgfbr1 cKO mice. Increased inflammation and angiogenesis have
been found in human HNSCCs (25). Deletion of Tgfbr2 in mouse
head and neck epithelia resulted in enhanced paracrine effect of
TGF-h on tumor stroma (14). To investigate the paracrine effect of
TGF-h in tumor progression in the DMBA-treated Tgfbr1 cKO
mice, we analyzed the expression level of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2;
ref. 26), endoglin (CD105; ref. 27), and a-smooth muscle actin
(SMA) in tumor stroma (28, 29). We found that Cox-2 expression
was absent in normal buccal mucosa and tongue of Tgfbr1f/f mice,
as well as in Tgfbr1 cKO mice, but its expression was significantly
increased in SCCs, suggesting increased inflammation in tumors

(Fig. 4A and B). Increased angiogenesis indicated by endoglin
(CD105)–stained microvessels in the stroma surrounding SCCs was
also observed (Fig. 4A and B). Using immunofluorescent staining,
we found that a-SMA, a hallmark of the myofibroblastic phenotype,
was strongly expressed in the stroma surrounding SCCs but was
not detected in the tongues of Tgfbr1f/f mice (Fig. 4A). To
determine whether these enhanced paracrine effects correlate
with endogenous TGF-h1 levels in the area surrounding the SCCs,
we examined Tgfb1 mRNA expression by qRT-PCR. In comparison
with tissues from Tgfb1f/f mice, the levels of Tgfb1 mRNA
expression were increased 2.42 F 0.31–fold and 27.08 F 4.42–fold
(P < 0.01) in DMBA-treated Tgfbr1 cKO mice tongues and SCCs,
respectively (Fig. 4C). Immunofluorescent staining indicated
significantly increased expression of Tgfb1 located only in the
tumor stroma (Fig. 4D).
Evasion of the immune response is one of the most important
features of TGF-h–mediated tumor progression (30, 31). We
analyzed the immune status of the Tgfbr1 cKO mice using flow
cytometry analysis. Compared with their control littermates, Tgfbr1
cKO mice showed significantly reduced numbers of both CD4+ and
CD8+ effector T cells in jugular lymph nodes. In contrast, the
regulatory T cells (CD4+CD25+Foxp3+) were increased, indicating

active immune suppression in Tgfbr1 cKO mice. Gross changes in
inflammation within tumors were noted by H&E staining
(Supplementary Fig. S2A and B).
Activation of PI3K/Akt signaling in SCCs of Tgfbr1 cKO
mice. The PI3K/Akt pathway is important in suppressing
apoptosis and in promoting cell growth and proliferation.
Hyperactivation of PI3K/Akt in HNSCC is induced either by
mutations or by enhanced activity of its upstream activators,
including the Ras oncogene or inactivation of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10; ref. 32).
PTEN is a potent tumor suppressor gene and a negative
regulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Mutations of PTEN have
been found in a wide range of human cancers (33). In our study,
a significantly increased level of unphosphorylated PTEN, an
active form of the protein, was detected in all of the tumors that
developed in the DMBA-treated Tgfbr1 cKO mice (Fig. 5B).
However, despite the elevated PTEN levels, we observed
consistently increased levels of the phosphorylated form of Akt
(p-Akt) and its downstream target, the mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR), in all of the tumors analyzed by both
immunostaining and Western blot (Fig. 5A and B). These results
indicate that in spite of the increased expression of PTEN,

Tgfbr1 and PI3K/Akt Pathway in HNSCC

Figure 5. Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in
Tgfbr1 cKO mice. A, immunostaining revealed a
significantly increased number of positive cells
of p-Akt and p-mTOR in the SCCs that developed in
Tgfbr1 cKO mice. The dotted lines delineate the

Western blot analysis.

the PI3K/Akt pathway was activated in the SCCs that developed
in the DMBA-treated Tgfbr1 cKO mice. Our results suggest
that Akt activation in the SCCs is independent of effects on
PTEN in this mouse model and that other mechanisms are
involved in the activation of this pathway. One of these might
be the H-ras mutations caused by DMBA initiation. Indeed, H-ras
mutations were detected in 9 of 17 tumors (53%) at codon 61 in
exon 2 of the gene. No K-ras mutations were found in any of these
tumors (data not shown). However, the mechanisms underlying
the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway on TGFBR1 deletion
warrant further investigation. A proposed TGF-h signaling alteration that promotes HNSCC in mice through activation of PI3K/
Akt pathway is shown in Fig. 6.

Discussion
TGF-h is a potent growth inhibitor for epithelial cells (34).
Inactivating mutations or experimental deletion of components of
the TGF-h pathway has been shown to promote tumorigenesis in
a variety of organ systems (35, 36). However, the precise role of
TGF-h signaling in head and neck carcinogenesis has not been fully
understood. As with other organ systems, existing research has
been mainly focused on TGFBR2. Inactivation of Tgfbr2 by
overexpression of dominant-negative receptor constructs or by
targeted deletion promotes tumorigenesis in the mammary gland,
prostate, pancreas, anogenital region, as well as in the head and
neck area (14, 37–40). With one exception (40), inactivation of
Tgfbr2 does not generally result in tumor formation unless
cooperating oncogenic lesions are present, suggesting that loss of
TGF-h response plays a tumor-promoting rather than initiating
role (14, 41). Interestingly, mice that harbored an inactivated Tgfbr2
in stromal cells developed intraepithelial neoplasia of the prostate
and invasive SCCs in the forestomach. This suggests that alterations in the TGF-h signaling pathway within cells of the tumor

www.aacrjournals.org

microenvironment can also contribute to cancer development and
progression (38). Even in cases where the TGF-h pathway is
compromised specifically in the epithelium, the effects of this
perturbation seem to extend to the stroma. Thus, mice with
inactivated Tgfbr2 in the mammary epithelium show increased
recruitment of F4/80+ cells, increased expression of proinflammatory genes, and altered composition of the fibrovascular
stroma—all effects that may promote further tumor progression
(42). It is clear that perturbations in TGF-h signaling can have farreaching effects throughout the ecosystem of the tumor.
It is important to note that TGFBR2 not only interacts with
TGFBR1 but also forms functional complexes with other type I
receptors, such as ActRI/ALK2, ALK3, or ALK1 (43, 44). Signaling
through TGFBR2/Alk1 complexes activates Smad1, Smad5, and
Smad8, whereas signaling through the TGFBR2/TGFBR1 complex
results in phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3. In fact, TGF-h
signaling through TGFBR1 and ALK1, in a complex with TGFBR2,
showed opposing activities in endothelial cell migration and
proliferation (45). Importantly, in epithelial cells, TGFBR2 can also
directly phosphorylate Par6 without involvement of TGFBR1 and
release Par6 from the Par6-TGFBR1 complex. This allows Par6 to
trigger the dissolution of tight junctions in the context of epithelialmesenchymal transitions (46). Therefore, knocking out Tgfbr2
affects not only Smad-mediated TGF-h signaling but also direct
receptor II–mediated alternative signaling via Par6. Thus, knocking
out TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 individually could affect downstream
signaling differently, leading to distinct biological outcomes.
TGFBR1 forms heterotetrameric complexes with TGFBR2 on the
cell surface and is critical for the downstream phosphorylation and
activation of the Smads. Mutations and polymorphisms of TGFBR1
have been described: TGFBR1(6A), a 9-bp deletion coding for three
alanine residues within the nine alanine repeat region of exon 1,
has been particularly associated with HNSCC (15–17). In an earlier

study, we showed that 35% of mice with a targeted deletion of
Tgfbr1 developed spontaneous SCCs in periorbital and/or perianal
regions (19). To specifically study the role of Tgfbr1-mediated
signaling in the progression of HNSCCs, we developed a novel
inducible knockout mouse model by deleting Tgfbr1 in head and
neck epithelia.
Most of our findings on the Tgfbr1 cKO mouse model are
consistent with the findings from DMBA-initiated Tgfbr2 cKO mice
(14), suggesting that Tgfbr1 functions similarly to Tgfbr2 in the
progression of HNSCCs. The lack of spontaneous tumor formation
in Tgfbr1 cKO mice, together with the fact that DMBA treatment
facilitates tumor development in these mice, suggests that rather
than initiation, loss of Tgfbr1 may play a more crucial role in tumor
progression in mouse HNSCC. This is also the case for other
epithelia, with the sole exception of the anogenital region (40).
However, several differences have also been noted in our DMBAinitiated Tgfbr1 cKO mice compared with DMBA-initiated Tgfbr2
cKO mice. For example, none of our DMBA-initiated Tgfbr1
heterozygous mice (K14-CreERtam;Tgfbr1 f/ +) developed HNSCCs,
whereas f33% of mice with a heterozygous Tgfbr2 deletion
(K5-CrePR1;Tgfbr2 f/ +) in the head and neck epithelia developed
HNSCCs after DMBA initiation. Therefore, tumor suppressor
activities of TGF-h require a higher threshold level of Tgfbr2 than
of Tgfbr1. Furthermore, only 16% of our DMBA-initiated Tgfbr1
cKO mice with tumors developed metastases in jugular lymph
nodes and/or lungs by the time the mice were dissected. However,
up to 35% of the DMBA-initiated Tgfbr2 cKO mice developed
jugular lymph node metastases by 20 to 39 weeks of age. Although
this difference between the two mouse models may be attributable
to differences in mouse genetic background and/or the Cre mouse
line being used in the studies, it may also indicate that Tgfbr1 and
Tgfbr2 function differently. For example, Tgfbr2 may have more
suppressive effects in later stages of cancer development, possibly
due to TGFBR1-independent effects.

It is widely believed that TGF-h can affect cancer progression
through both autocrine and paracrine effects. Paracrine effects of
TGF-h, which are generally tumor promoting, include stimulation
of inflammation and angiogenesis, escape from immunosurveillance, and recruitment of myofibroblasts. Autocrine effects of
TGF-h in premalignant epithelial cells are tumor suppressive,
whereas more advanced cancer cells with a functional TGF-h
receptor complex may exhibit tumor-promoting autocrine effects
due to a convergence of TGF-h signaling with other signaling
pathways (47). In the current study, we saw evidence for both types
of effect. We found that on deletion of Tgfbr1 in mouse head and
neck epithelia, there is an enhanced cell proliferation and downregulation of cell cycle inhibitors due to inactivation of Smad2/
3-mediated signaling. An inhibition of apoptosis through activation
of the PI3K/Akt pathway in SCCs that developed in Tgfbr1 cKO
mice was also observed. These results suggest that in the head and
neck epithelia, TGF-h is an early tumor suppressor. In the SCCs
that developed in Tgfbr1 cKO mice, we found increased
inflammation, angiogenesis, and myofibroblast formation. Similar
results have been observed in other mouse models when TGF-h
signaling was disrupted (14, 48). Furthermore, elevated levels of
endogenous TGF-h1 were detected in tumor stroma of Tgfbr1 cKO
mice, as they have been in other studies (14). Therefore, on one
hand, the deletion of Tgfbr1 in mouse head and neck epithelia
prevents the surrounding increased TGF-h1 from exerting its
tumor-suppressive effects. On the other hand, the expression of
Tgfbr1 in tumor stroma would certainly enhance its tumorpromoting function through paracrine effects. Consequently, we
believe that the elevated level of TGF-h1 in tumor stroma has
direct involvement in the creation of microenvironment for
tumor progression (4).
Alternative modes of TGF-h signaling have been categorized (8).
Recent work showed that TGF-h induces apoptosis through
repression of PI3K/Akt signaling, indicating that there may be

Figure 6. A schematic presentation of the proposed TGF-h signaling alteration that promotes HNSCC in mice. In normal cells, TGF-h inhibits cell proliferation
through the Smad-dependent pathway. It also induces apoptosis by repressing the PI3K/Akt pathway results in tumor suppression. Decreased Tgfbr1 expression
in Tgfbr1 cKO mice leads to increased cell proliferation and cell survival through PTEN-independent activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. DMBA treatment, which
causes H-ras mutation as well as other mechanisms, may also play an important role in Akt activation. Decreased TGFBR1 can also increase TGF-h1 in tumor stroma
by as yet unidentified mechanisms, which leads to increased invasion, angiogenesis, and inflammation, as well as immune suppression through the paracrine
effect of TGF-h. In summary, inactivation of TGF-h signaling, in the context of ras mutations and aberrant activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and accompanied
by increased paracrine effect of TGF-h, switches TGF-h signaling from tumor suppression in normal cells to tumor promotion in head and neck carcinogenesis
of Tgfbr1 cKO mice.

Tgfbr1 and PI3K/Akt Pathway in HNSCC

negative cross-talk between the TGF-h tumor suppressor and
PI3K/Akt pathways (49). The most notable finding of our current
study is that in addition to inactivation of the Smad-dependent
TGF-h signaling pathway and in spite of increased PTEN levels
after deletion of Tgfbr1 in mouse head and neck epithelia and
DMBA treatment, the PI3K/Akt pathway is activated in all SCCs
that developed in the Tgfbr1 cKO mice. The results from our study
indicate that decreased Tgfbr1 expression in Tgfbr1 cKO mice leads
to increased cell proliferation and cell survival through PTENindependent activation of PI3K/Akt pathway. This is possibly due
to DMBA-induced H-ras mutation as well as other unknown
mechanisms. These changes accompanied by increased TGF-h1 in
tumor stroma, which leads to increased invasion, angiogenesis,
inflammation, and immune suppression through paracrine effect of
TGF-h, switch TGF-h signaling from tumor suppression in normal
cells to tumor promotion in head and neck carcinogenesis of
Tgfbr1 cKO mice.
In summary, we generated an inducible conditional gene
targeting mouse model for head and neck cancer research. We
have shown that targeted deletion of Tgfbr1 in the head and neck
epithelia is apparently not sufficient for spontaneous tumor
formation but could increase susceptibility to tumor development
initiated by DMBA. TGF-h is a major tumor suppressor, and

inactivation of TGF-h signaling, in the context of ras mutations
and aberrant activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, may contribute
cooperatively to the promotion of head and neck carcinogenesis in
these mice. Our results underscore a critical role of the TGF-h
signaling pathway and its cross-talk with the PI3K/Akt pathway in
suppressing head and neck carcinogenesis. These findings have
significant implications for the development of effective therapeutic strategies targeting both the TGF-h and the PI3K/Akt pathways
for the treatment of HNSCCs.
