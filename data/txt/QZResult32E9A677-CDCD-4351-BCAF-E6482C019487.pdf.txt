ABSTRACT
As PI3K/Akt signaling is frequently deregulated in a wide variety of human
tumors, PI3K inhibitors are an emerging class of drugs for cancer treatment. The
monitoring of the drug behavior and distribution in the biological system can play an
important role for targeted therapy and provide information regarding the response
or resistance to available therapies. In this study, therefore, we have developed a
family of xanthine derivatives, serving as a dual function exhibiting fluorescence,
as well as inhibiting PI3K. Among them, HS-133 showed anti-proliferative effects
and was monitored for its subcellular localization by a fluorescence microscopy.
HS-133 suppressed the PI3K/Akt pathway and induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1
phase. The induction of apoptosis by HS-133 was confirmed by the increases of the
cleaved PARP, caspase-3, and caspase-8. Furthermore, HS-133 decreased the protein
expression of HIF-1α and VEGF, as well inhibited the tube formation and migration of
the human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In vivo imaging also showed that tumors
were visualized fluorescent with HS-133, and its oral administration significantly
inhibited the growth of tumor in SkBr3 mouse xenograft models. Thus, we suggest
that HS-133 may be used as a fluorescent anticancer agent against human breast
cancer.

growth factors or insulin to the cell surface receptors,
which activates the class IA PI3K that converts the plasma
membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate
(PIP2) to PIP3. PIP3 plays a key role in recruiting proteins,
such as the serine/threonine kinases phosphoinositidedependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and Akt (also known as
PKB), to the plasma membrane [3, 5]. This in turn
activates Akt which subsequently phosphorylates mTOR
and several other cytoplasmic proteins [6]. A serine/
threonine kinase, mTOR, has diverse cellular functions,

INTRODUCTION
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K) are
responsible for the generation of 3-phosphorylated
inositides, such as the important second messenger
phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5-trisphosphate (PIP3), resulting
in an activation of the signal transduction pathways
implicated in many essential cellular processes, including
metabolism, cell survival, growth, and differentiation
[1–4]. The PI3K pathway is initiated by the binding of

including regulation of mRNA translation, cell growth
and proliferation, ribosome biogenesis, transcription,
cytoskeletal reorganization, long-term potentiation and
autophagy [7]. The mTOR serves as the catalytic subunit
in two distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1)
and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), which vary both in
their subunit components and their function [8, 9].
The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is the most
commonly activated pathway in human cancer [6, 10,
11]. In particular, members of class IA PI3Ks among
several isoforms of the PI3K family are implicated
and often mutated in human cancer [12–15]. The
deregulation of this pathway has been implicated in
tumor initiation, cell growth and survival, invasion and
angiogenesis [4]. As such, there is a strong rationale for
targeting PI3K, especially in cancers that are known to
carry alterations in PI3K/Akt signaling. Inhibition of
this pathway is an attractive target for the development
of new anticancer strategies. A new generation of PI3K
inhibitors is emerging, overcoming earlier problems of
poor selectivity, unfavorable pharmacokinetic profiles, and
unacceptable toxicity [10, 16]. A number of these agents
have entered the early phase clinical trials [17]. Some
major pharmaceutical companies are currently testing the
hypothesis that ATP competitive mTOR or dual-PI3K/
mTOR inhibitors will be able to overcome the limited
clinical responses that have been observed with rapamycin
and its analogs (rapalogs) [18].
The monitoring of the drug behavior and distribution
in the biological system can play an important role for the
targeted therapy and provide a biological rationale for the
design of new therapeutics with improved properties and
fewer side effects [19]. A response to PI3K inhibition is
often associated with tumor stasis rather than shrinkage
[20–23]. The utility of such traditional imaging methods
as computed tomography (CT), ultrasound imaging, and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in monitoring early
response is limited [23]. Accordingly, there is a critical
need for noninvasive functional imaging biomarkers
that confirm drug delivery and molecular drug activity.
The tethering of fluorescent dyes to drugs is a popular
method for visually monitoring the time course of the
drug behavior, and also provides a useful tool for studying
cellular, animal and clinical imaging in a noninvasive,
nonradioactive, and stable procedure [24–26]. However,
the addition of fluorophores into the drug molecules
often causes undesired effects on the binding affinity, cell
permeability, in vivo activity and toxicity. These problems
can be overcome if one drug has a dual function that
exhibits fluorescence as well as anticancer activity.
Xanthines are known as important alkaloids, which
are biologically active and constitute a major class of
adenosine receptor antagonists, as well as fluorophores.
We recently reported on the identification of a family of
potent fluorescent PI3Kα inhibitors from xanthine scaffold
in which the part of the fluorophore was engineered to be
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

a pharmacophore capable of inhibiting PI3Kα [26, 27].
Further we showed that the xanthine derivatives blocked
cancer cell proliferation and monitored its subcellular
localization by fluorescent microscopy [26].
In the study, we selected N-(4-(7-(3-Fluorophenyl)-1,
3-dimethyl-2, 6-dioxo-2, 3, 6, 7-tetrahydro-1H-purin-8-yl)
phenyl) acetamide (HS-133), which was found to be the
most potent fluorescent PI3K inhibitor and investigated
whether or not HS-133 possesses anti-cancer activity
against breast cancer and its molecular mechanism.
HS-133 potently inhibited PI3K/Akt pathway signaling
and cell growth/proliferation in human breast cancer cells
together with suppressing tumor growth in the xenograft
models. Furthermore, the inherent fluorescence of HS-133
was detected in tumor bearing mice, as well as intracellular
localization, and its pharmacokinetic properties exhibited
good oral bioavailability.

RESULTS
Synthesis and binding mode of a new PI3Kα
inhibitor, HS-133
A novel compound HS-133 was synthesized and
was found to be a potent ATP-competitive inhibitor against
PI3Kα (Fig. 1A) [26]. The calculated binding mode of
the inhibitor HS-133 in the ATP-binding sites of PI3Kα
was calculated using the modified Auto Dock program
in Fig. 1B. Hydrogen bonding groups on the inhibitors
appeared to point toward the backbone groups of the ATP
binding site, with their hydrophobic groups situated in
the proximity of the Gly loop. The carbonyl moiety at the
3-position of xanthine core can forms a hydrogen bond
to the backbone aminocarbonyl nitrogen of Val851 in the
hinge region, and the amide group of HS-133 donates a
hydrogen bond to the side-chain carboxylate of Asp810. In
addition, the fluoro group at the 5-phenyl group appeared
to form a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of
Ser774. These three hydrogen bonds appear to play a role
of anchoring HS-133 at the ATP-binding site. Compound
HS-133 can be further stabilized in the ATP-binding site
of the PI3Kα via hydrophobic interactions with the side
chains of Lys776, Asp805, Asp806, Asp806, Tyr836,
Ile848, Asp933, and Gly935. Thus, the overall structural
features derived from the docking simulations suggested
that the inhibitory activity of HS-133 should stem from
multiple hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions
established simultaneously in the ATP-binding site.

Intracellular monitoring studies by

When SkBr3 breast cancer cells were incubated
with HS-133 (10 μM) for 4 h, fluorescence became clearly
visible in the cytoplasm of SkBr3 cells, providing visual

It has been shown that breast tumor cell growth
is closely related to the activation of the PI3K/Akt
pathway [28–30]. The IC50 determination was performed

(Fig. 2A). Therefore, we evaluated the effects of HS-133
on the PI3K/Akt pathway in breast cancer cells. The PI3K
inhibitory activity of HS-133 was assessed in the SkBr3

cells. The phosphorylation of Akt and its substrate, mTOR,
and phosphorylation of downstream factors, including
p70S6K and 4E-BP1were also effectively suppressed
(Fig. 2B).

To determine whether HS-133 can function as a
novel anticancer compound, we tested the ability of this
compound to inhibit the growth of breast cancer cell lines
(SkBr3, T47D, and MCF-7) using an MTT assay. The
cells were exposed to various concentrations (0.5–50 μM)
of HS-133 for 48 h. As shown in Fig. 3A-C, HS-133
inhibited the growth of all three breast cancer cell lines
in a dose-dependent manner. The IC50 values of HS-133

using a flow cytometry. The SkBr3 cells were treated for
24 h with various concentrations of HS-133 (1, 10, 50 μM)
and collected and stained with PI and then analyzed by
FACS. As shown in the Fig. 4A and 4B, HS-133 increased
the number of cells in the G0/G1 phase. The up-regulation
of p27, cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, is related
to G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and contributes to the downregulation of cyclin D1 [31]. Thus, we evaluated the
effect of HS-133 on the protein expressions of p27 and
cyclin D1. HS-133 increased the expression of p27 while
decreasing cyclin D1 expression (Fig. 4C).
Since PI3K and its downstream effectors appear to
mediate anti-apoptotic signals, we examined the effect
of HS-133 on apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 5A, HS-133
promoted the cleavage of PARP, caspase-9, caspase-8 and
casepase-3. We also observed that the levels of Bax, proapoptotic protein, were increased by HS-133 treatment
in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, induction of
apoptosis by HS-133 was confirmed by visualizing the
fragmented DNA with TUNEL staining (Fig. 5B). These

results showed that HS-133 could induce apoptosis in the
SkBr3 cells.

HS-133 suppresses angiogenesis
Since HIF-1α is the major regulator of cellular
adaptive responses to hypoxia, we examined the effect of
HS-133 on the expression of the HIF-1α in SkBr3 cells.
The cells were treated with various concentrations of
HS-133 (1–50 μM) under hypoxic mimicking conditions
induced by a treatment with 100 μM CoCl2 for 16 h. As
shown in Fig. 6A, HS-133 inhibited the hypoxia-induced
HIF-1α expression. To further determine the effect of HS133 on hypoxia-induced VEGF, an immediate downstream
target gene of HIF-1α, the protein and production of
VEGF were measured by western blotting and ELISA in
the SkBr3 cells. A notable increase of VEGF was observed
under hypoxic conditions, and the HS-133 treatment was
found to suppress the VEGF expression and production in
a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6A and 6B).

To examine the effect of HS-133 on angiogenesis,
a capillary tube formation assay using human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was performed. HS-133
inhibited the formation of vessel-like structures, characterized
by elongation and alignment of the cells at the indicated
concentrations (Fig. 6C). Cell migration is critical for the

endothelial cells to form blood vessels during angiogenesis,
and is necessary for tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, we
conducted a wound migration assay to study the effect of
HS-133 on cell migration. When the endothelial cell layer
was wounded and incubated in a medium containing 1, 5, or
10 μM HS-133 for 18 h, the cell migration was significantly

ability to block angiogenesis.

administration of HS-133 showed to be 1,480 mL/h/kg
and 12,000 mL/kg, respectively. The high Vss value of
HS-133 may indicate that HS-133 shows a rapid and high
distribution to the tissues. Other major pharmacokinetic
parameters are shown in Table 1.
Various tissue concentrations, such as the heart,
lung, liver, kidney, spleen, brain, and tumor in BALB/c
nude mice bearing SkBr3 xenograft are shown in
Fig. 9B. The ratios of each tissue-to-plasma (KP value)
were 3.26, 4.18, 0.11, 1.99, 3.07, 4.99, and 2.06 for
the heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, brain, and tumor,
respectively. Almost all tissues except the liver showed
high concentration levels of HS-133 compared to the
plasma concentration. Especially, HS-133 in the tumor
tissue also showed high concentration level, being over
two times the plasma concentration level. Thus, this high
concentration level of HS-133 in tumor tissues may be
contributed to in vivo efficacy in the SkBr3 xenograft
model.

In vivo imaging of HS-133
To evaluate whether HS-133 can be detected as
fluorescent in the tumor, we used the SkBr3 xenograft
model in which human breast cancer cells were
inoculated into the dorsal flank of BALB/c nude mice.
Fluorescence of HS-133 was obviously detected when
HS-133 was injected intratumorally into SkBr3 tumorbearing mice (Fig. 7A). Tumors were excised at 1 h after
the intratumoral injection of HS-133, frozen sectioned,
and observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope
after propidium iodide (PI) staining. As a result, the
fluorescence by HS-133 became clearly visible in the
isolated tumor (Fig. 7B).

HS-133 inhibits tumor growth
We examined the effects of HS-133 using athymic
BALB/c nude mice implanted with the SkBr3 cells. HS133 was injected intratumorally 2 times per week with a
dose of 5 mg/kg when tumors reached an average volume
of 50–100 mm3. As a result, tumor volume and weight
were remarkably reduced, showing an antitumor activity
in mice treated with HS-133 (Fig. 8A and 8B). When
HS-133 was also administered orally with a daily dose
of 10 mg/kg for 21 days, it significantly suppressed the
tumor growth (Fig. 8C). The average tumor volume of­
HS-133 treated mice was reduced by about 50% compared
to that of control mice (Fig. 8D). To assess the general
toxicity, we also measured the body weight change in
tumor-bearing mice. The same dose of HS-133 showed no
significant change in the body weight (data not shown),
suggesting little toxicity of HS-133 at the tested dosage
and conditions.

HS-133 exhibits the good oral bioavailability
Extensive preclinical pharmacokinetic evaluation
of HS-133 in ICR mice and BALB/c nude mice bearing
SkBr3 xenograft has been performed. The plasma
concentration-time profile of HS-133 after oral (PO) and
intravenous (IV) administration is shown in Fig. 9A. In
brief, the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of HS-133 was
236 ng/mL occurring at approximately 4.8 h post-dose, and
the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)
after intravenous and oral administration were 3,410 and
3,260 h×ng/mL, respectively. The bioavailability (F value)
of HS-133 was 95.6%; thus, almost all molecules of
HS-133 after oral administration were exposed to the
systemic circulation system. Clearance (CL) and volume

DISCUSSION
The PI3K/Akt pathway is one of the most frequently
activated and deregulated pathways in various human
cancers [6, 32, 33]. Specifically, over 70% of human
breast cancers have a deregulated PI3K/Akt pathway [34].
The high frequency of PI3K/Akt pathway alterations in
cancer has led to a surge in the development of PI3K
inhibitors. Therapeutic targeting of the PI3K/Akt pathway
with small molecule inhibitors may have clinical benefit,
either as a single agent in PI3K-addicted cancers or used
more broadly in combination with other conventional or
targeted therapies. Several classes of inhibitors targeting
this pathway, including both the natural and chemically
synthesized agents, have been reported and now entered
the clinical trials phase. Despite differences in chemical
structures, most PI3K inhibitors competitively inhibit ATP
binding at the catalytic site [17, 33, 35, 36]. Although the
monitoring of intracellular drug delivery and intratumoral
distribution can provide information for target therapy, it
has remained difficult and proven to still be challenging.
Radiolabeling exposes patients to ionizing radiation
and results in imaging with poor spatial and temporal
resolution. Optical labeling overcomes these disadvantages
but suffers from poor tissue penetration, preventing wholebody imaging [37]. Therefore, there is a critical need for
noninvasive functional imaging biomarkers that confirm
drug delivery and molecular drug activity at the tumor. In
an effort to develop potent PI3K inhibitors, which provide
an imageable ‘readout’, we screened a large number of
novel fluorescent analogs of xanthine [26]. In this study,
we describe the detailed pharmacologic characterization
of HS-133, which revealed high potency against PI3Kα
(0.992 μM) among them. We have shown that HS-133
modulated PI3K/Akt signaling, elicited cell cycle arrest

regulating p27, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) protein
and cyclin D1, and ultimately induced apoptosis through
extrinsic and mitochondria-related pathways in breast
cancer cells. Our findings are consistent with the results
that the PI3K/Akt pathway contributes to the regulation
of cell cycle progression, particularly at the G1/S
transition [3, 38].
Interestingly, inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway
may attack tumors by two distinct directions, by blocking
the tumor cell growth directly and by inhibiting tumor
angiogenesis. It is notable that the PI3K/Akt pathway
plays an important role in the production of the key
endothelial cell growth factor, VEGF, and in the signaling

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of the VEGF receptor [33]. HIF-1α plays a central
role as the main regulator of the hypoxic transcription
response [39], and VEGF is a downstream molecule of
HIF-1α [40]. As shown in Fig. 6, HS-133 inhibited not
only the expression of HIF-1α and VEGF under hypoxia
induced by CoCl2 in SkBr3 cells, but also inhibited tube
formation of and migration of the endothelial cells.
Therefore, we suppose that HS-133 has a potential antiangiogenic capacity. Although HS-133 is very similar to
the pharmacological mechanism of IPD-196, a previously
reported PI3K inhibitor, the potency is distinctly
different [41]. In addition, the IC50 of HS-133 was higher
than the other PI3K inhibitor without fluorescence such

as HS-104 in breast cancer [42]. Thus, we need to further
develop the potent PI3K inhibitors with fluorescent
function.
We also demonstrated that orally administered and
intratumorally injected HS-133 has therapeutic efficacy
against human breast xenografts in mice. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first report of an intratumorally
injected PI3K inhibitor with antitumor activity and
fluorescent property in vivo. Until now, only a few
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

fluorescent inhibitors have been reported. For examples,
triapine, which entered phase I and phase II clinical
trials as a potent inhibitor of the enzyme ribonucleotide
reductase was shown to possess intrinsic fluorescence
properties [43]. Yenugonda et al. reported that fluorescent
CDK inhibitors (VMY-1-101 and VMY-1-103) blocked
the proliferation of human breast cancer cells [44].

promising anticancer agents for the potential dual imaging
and therapeutic application [45]. However, these studies
only experimented in vitro without in vivo experiments.
We investigated in vivo fluorescence imaging and detected
the fluorescence in SkBr3 xenograft models. In addition,
surprisingly, we observed that oral administration of
HS-133 had a remarkably good bioavailability, and the
high concentration level of HS-133 in tumor tissues
may be contributed to the in vivo efficacy in the SkBr3
xenograft model. In particular, since the level of HS-133
was the highest in the brain tissues, it seems to have the
potential for use in a targeted therapy for brain diseases.
Furthermore, we observed that HS-133 is more efficient
than other previously reported PI3K inhibitors in human
breast cancer. For example, although the IC50 of HS-104
(4.8 μM) was more effective by approximately 8 folds than
HS-133 (32 μM) in SkBr3 cells, tumor growth inhibition
was shown at the lower dose of HS-133 compared to
HS-104 against SkBr3-bearing xenograft mice
(respectively 10 mg/kg/d, 20 mg/kg/d) [42]. The reason
why HS-133 showed better effect in our experiments may
be due to good oral bioavailability. Recent studies have
demonstrated that a number of natural products isolated
from the plants (e.g. fruits, vegetables, spices, nuts,
legumes, herbs, etc.) also inhibit the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway, and exhibit potent anticancer activities. As
most of the natural products occur in our every diet day,
and are very safe, the results suggest that those natural
products may be explored for cancer prevention and
treatment [36]. This special issue selects apigenin [46],
curcumin [47], cryptotanshinone [48], fisetin [49], indoles
(indole-3-carbinol and 3, 3-diindolylmethane) [50],
isoflavones (genistein and deguelin) [51], quercetin [52],
resveratrol [53], and tocotrienol [54]. Among them,
cryptotanshinone is a potential anticancer agent. However,
cryptotanshinone has not been in clinical trials for

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

any cancer therapy because of its poor bioavailability.
Considering the poor bioavailability of natural products,
the good bioavailability of HS-133 can be the best
advantage.
In conclusion, we have designed and synthesized
HS-133, a fluorescent PI3K inhibitor with potent antiproliferative, pro-apoptotic capabilities, anti-angiogenic,
and anti-tumor effects in human breast cancer. The
intrinsic fluorescent properties of HS-133 may be proved
to be useful by providing opportunities to study the cellular
distribution, delivery and behavior in the biological system
of the drugs. These findings lead us to believe that HS-133
may represent to be a promising class of anticancer agents
for potential dual imaging and therapeutic applications
targeting PI3K/Akt signaling.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and materials
The human breast cancer cell lines SkBr3, T47D,
and MCF-7, were purchased from the Korean Cell
Line Bank (KCLB, Seoul, Korea). The SkBr3 cells
were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM), and T47D and MCF-7 cells were cultured
in Roswell Park Memorial Institute Media 1640
­(RPMI-1640), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. FBS, cell culture
media, penicillin-streptomycin, and all other agents used
in cell culture studies were purchased from GIBCO
(Grand Island, NY). Cultures were maintained at 37°C in
a CO2 incubator with a controlled humidified atmosphere
composed of 95% air and 5% CO2. Human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were grown in a gelatin
coated 75 cm2 flask in a M199 medium containing
20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), 100 U/ml

at a density of 1-5 × 103 cells/well in a 96-well plate for
48 h. The medium was removed, and the cells were treated
with either DMSO as control or various concentrations of
HS-133. The final concentration of DMSO in the medium
was ≤ 0.1% (v/v). After the cells were incubated for 48 h,
20 μl of MTT solutions (2 mg/ml) was added to each well
for another 4 h at 37°C. The formazan crystals that formed
were dissolved in DMSO (200 μl/well) via constant
shaking for 5 min. The plate was then read on a microplate
reader at 540 nm. Three replicate wells were used for
each analysis. The median inhibitory concentration (IC50,
defined as the drug concentration at which cell growth was
inhibited by 50%) was assessed from the dose-response
curves.

The SkBr3 cells were plated on18-mm cover
glasses in DMEM medium and incubated for 24 h so that
approximately 70% confluence was reached. The cells
were then incubated in the presence or absence of 10 μM
HS-133 for 4 h. After washing with phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) three times, each slide was covered with
DABCO (Sigma-Aldrich) and observed using a confocal
laser scanning microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

The cells were washed three times with ice-cold
PBS before lysis, and were lysed with a buffer containing
1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40 (NP-40), as well as
protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (GenDEPOT,
Barker, TX). Equal amounts of protein were separated
by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto the
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore,
Bedford, MA). Immunostaining was performed
by incubating the blots with primary antibodies,
followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
secondary antibody and detected with an enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) plus system (Amersham
Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The primary mouse
antibodies against the following factors were used: p27
(Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA), cyclin D1,
hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α, BD Biosciences,
SanJose, CA), VEGF (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO)
and β-actin (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). The primary
rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the following proteins
were also used: cleaved caspase-3, poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase protein (PARP), p-Akt, Akt, p-mTOR, mTOR,
p-p70S6K, p70S6K, p-4E-BP1, 4E-BP1 (Cell Signaling
Technologies), cleaved caspase-8, procasepase-9 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and α-tubulin
(Abcam). The secondary antibodies were purchased from
Amersham Biosciences.

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was performed by an MTT assay.
Briefly, the SkBr3, T47D, and MCF-7 cells were plated

Cell cycle analysis

(50 nM) and/or VEGF (50 ng/ml). HUVECs were allowed
to migrate for 18 h and were rinsed with a serum-free
medium, followed by fixing with absolute methanol and
staining with Giemsa (Sigma-Aldrich). Migration was
quantitated with counting the number of cells that moved
beyond the reference line.

The SkBr3 cells were plated in 100 mm-diameter
culture dishes. On the following day, the cells were
treated with various concentrations of HS-133 or 0.1%
DMSO for 24 h. The floating and adherent cells were
collected and fixed in cold 70% ethanol at 4°C overnight.
After washing, the cells were subsequently stained with
50 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) and 100 μg/ml RNase
A for 1 h in the dark and subjected to a flow cytometric
analysis to determine the percentage of cells at specific
phases of the cell cycle. A flow cytometric analysis was
performed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton
Dickinson, San Jose, CA) equipped with a 488 nm argon
laser. The events were evaluated for each sample and the
cell cycle distribution was analyzed using Cell Quest
software (Becton Dickinson). The results were presented
as the number of cells versus the amount of DNA, as
indicated by the intensity of a fluorescence signal. All the
experiments were conducted three times.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
The amount of VEGF secreted into the media was
measured by sandwich ELISA. ELISA plates (Nunc,
Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 100 μl of 2 μg/ml
anti-VEGF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) antibody
in PBS for 24 h at 25°C. The plates were washed with
PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 and incubated for 1 h
at 25°C with 200 μl/well of 1% bovine serum albumin
(BSA, Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS. The conditioned medium
or various concentrations of recombinant human VEGF
were incubated for 2 h at 25°C with 100 μl of 75 ng/ml
biotinylatedanti-VEGF antibody, and the plates were
washed and further incubated for 30 min with 100 μl of
HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Vector Laboratories). After
washing, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 2 N
H2SO4. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured with a
96-well plate reader.

Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay
The SkBr3 cells were plated on 18-mm cover
glasses in DMEM medium and incubated for 24 h so
that approximately 70% confluence was reached. The
cells were then incubated in the presence or absence of
50 μM HS-133, washed twice with PBS, and fixed in an
acetone: methanol solution (1:1) for 10 min at -20°C. The
stained cells were examined for a fluorescence of nuclear
fragmentation. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–
mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) was performed
using the TUNEL kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA).

Tumor xenograft studies
To establish SkBr3 tumor xenograft in mice, the
SkBr3 cell line was grown in a culture, detached by
trypsinization, washed and resuspended in PBS. Six-week
old athymic BALB/c nude mice (Central Lab. Animal
Inc. Seoul, Korea) were injected with 5 × 106 cells in the
right flank of each mouse to initiate tumor growth. After
reaching a tumor volume of 50–100 mm3, mice were
randomly divided into two groups, each having six mice.
Mice in the control group were fed with a 0.2 mL vehicle
(DMSO:PEG400:saline = 5:50:45) by oral gavage daily
and the second group with 10 mg/kg dose of HS-133 in
0.2 mL daily for 21 days. For intratumoral administration,
HS-133 was injected intratumorally with 2 times per
week with a dose of 5 mg/kg when tumors reached an
average volume of 50–100 mm3. The body weight and
tumor size were recorded twice per week. The tumor size
was calculated by 0.5 × long axis × (short axis) 2. Animal
care and experimental procedures were conducted in
accordance with the Guide for Animal Experiments by the
Korean Academy of Medical Sciences, and the protocols
used to this study were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee in Inha University
Hospital (Approval No. 110802-105).

Tube formation assay
A 10 mg/ml (200 μl) of Matrigel (BD Biosciences)
was polymerized for 30 min at 37°C. HUVECs were
suspended in M199 (2% FBS) medium containing
VEGF (50 ng/ml) at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/ml, and
0.2 ml of cell suspension was added to each well coated
with Matrigel, together with or without the indicated
concentrations of HS-133 for 20 h. The morphological
changes of the cells and tubes formed were observed under
a phase-contrast microscope and photographed at 200×
and 400× magnification.

Wound migration assay
HUVECs plated on 60 mm-diameter culture dishes
at 90% confluence, were wounded 2 mm in width with
a sterile razor blade and marked at the injury line. After
wounding, the peeled off cells were removed with a
serum-free medium and further incubated in M199 with
2% FBS, 1 mM thymidine (Sigma-Aldrich), HS-133

SkBr3 cells in the right flank of each mouse to initiate tumor
growth. HS-133 was injected via an intratumoral injection in
the SkBr3 tumor bearing mice. The mice were anesthetized
with intraperitoneal (IP) administration of ketamin/rumpun,
then, spectral fluorescence images were obtained with the
Maestro™ In-Vivo Fluorescence Imaging System (CRi,
Inc., Woburn, MA). The spectral fluorescence images
consisting of HS-133 (5 mg/kg) and autofluorescence
spectra were then unmixed based on their spectral patterns
using commercial software (Maestro software, CRi).

Pharmacokinetic study in mouse
Eight-week old ICR mice (23–25 g) were orally
given a 5 mg/kg dose of HS-133 in DMSO:PEG400:saline
= 5:50:45. Blood samples (approximately 0.15 mL) were
collected from each mouse (n = 3 mice per time point) by
a retro-orbital bleed or terminal cardiac puncture under
isoflurane anesthesia. Blood samples were collected in
tubes containing K2-EDTA as the anticoagulant, pre-dose
and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h post-dose. Samples were
centrifuged, and the plasma was collected and stored
at -80°C until analysis. Total concentrations of HS133 were determined by LC-MS/MS, following plasma
protein precipitation with acetonitrile, and injection of the
supernatant onto the column, a Hypersil Gold C18 column
(50 mm × 2.1 mm, 3μmparticle size; Thermo, Waltham,
MA). The Agilent 1260 HPLC and Agilent 6460 triple
quadrupole mass spectrometry system (Agilent Inc.,
Santa Clara, CA) were used for the LC-MS/MS assay.
The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and 10 mM
ammonium formate buffer (80:20, v/v), at a flow rate of
0.3 mL/min. The lower and upper limits of quantitation of
the assay were 0.005 and 10 μg/mL, respectively. The total
run time was 1.5 min and the ionization was conducted in
the positive ion mode.
The heart, lung, liver, kidney, brain, spleen, and
tumor were collected at 30 min post-dose from 3 different
animals at each time point, rinsed with ice-cold saline,
weighed and stored at -80°C until analysis. For HS-133
quantification, mouse tissues were homogenized with
three times the volume of PBS. The homogenates were
extracted by protein precipitation with acetonitrile.
LC-MS/MS analysis was conducted as described for the
plasma. The homogenate concentrations were converted
to tissue concentrations for the calculations of each tissueto-plasma ratio.
