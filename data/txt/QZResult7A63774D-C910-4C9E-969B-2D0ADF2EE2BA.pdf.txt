ABSTRACT
Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) has been recognized as a potential
therapeutic target for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Herein, we identified a novel
LSD1 inhibitor, JL1037, via Computer Aided Drug Design technology. JL1037 is a
potent, selective and reversible LSD1 inhibitor with IC50s of 0.1 μM and >1.5 μM for
LSD1 and monoamine oxidases A/B (MAO-A/B), respectively. Treatment of THP-1
and Kasumi-1 cell lines with JL1037 resulted in dose dependent accumulation of
H3K4me1 and H3K4me2, the major substrates of LSD1, as well as inhibition of cell
proliferation, blockade of cell cycle and induction of apoptosis. Further investigations
demonstrated that JL1037 could upregulate cell cycle-related proteins P21, P57, proapoptotic protein Bax and downregulate anti-apoptosis proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL.
JL1037 appeared to activate autophage response in AML cell lines as well as primary
cells from AML patients by increasing LC3-II expression and the formation of
autophagosomes and autolysosomes in cytoplasm. Co-treatment with autophagy
inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) enhanced JL1037-induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, daily
intravenous administration of JL1037 tended to reduce tumor burden and prolong
the survival of t(8;21) leukemia mice. In conclusion, JL1037 exhibited potent antileukemia effect and could be a potential therapeutic agent for AML treatment.

INTRODUCTION

a transcriptional repress or a transcriptional activator
depending on cell context [9–12]. In most cases, LSD1
is a transcriptional repressor suppressing the expression
of tumor suppressor genes through demethylating H3K4
in the promoter/enhancer regions, and therefore promotes
tumorigenesis.
More and more investigators have reported
that LSD1 is highly expressed and closely correlated
with poor prognosis in various kinds of malignancies
[13–16]. Harris and his colleagues had demonstrated
that LSD1 was preferentially expressed in leukemia
stem cell (LSC)-enriched population and functioned to
maintain LSC potential of AML cells. LSD1 knockdown
or pharmacological inhibition reduces the colonyforming cell (CFC) frequencies of MLL-AF9 AML

Epigenetic abnormalities are in close relationship
with the initiation and progression of leukemia [1, 2].
Since epigenetic abnormalities are generally reversible
by nature versus gene mutations, epigenetic targets
have great potentials for developing novel and more
effective therapeutic drugs for leukemia treatment.
Abnormality in histone lysine methylation modifications,
regulated by histone methyltransferases and histone
lysine demethylases (LSD), is one of the most common
epigenetic dysfunctions found in numerous types of
cancers including various forms of leukemia [3–7]. LSD1,
the first reported histone demethylase [8], participates
in many multisubunit complexes and serves as either

cells and induces cell differentiation [17]. The finding
provides further mechanism evidence for developing
small-molecule LSD1 inhibitors to treat AML and other
types of leukemia. Over the past few years, a large
number of irreversible inhibitors of LSD1 have been
developed by major pharmaceutical companies and
research institutes [18–20]. Among them, ORY-1001 and
GSK2879552, two TCP derivatives, developed by Oryzon
Genomics and GSK, respectively, have been in phase I
clinical trials for treatment of AML and small cell lung
cancer, respectively. Although the above irreversible
LSD1 inhibitors exhibit potent and long-lasting biological
effects, they may also produce endurable side-effects due
to extensive LSD1 inactivation. Effective reversible LSD1
inhibitors may be more desirable in terms of the control
of the target suppression and may alleviate some of the
side-effects caused by irreversible inhibitors, such as bone
marrow suppression [17].
In this study, using structure-based virtual screening
and subsequent compound optimization, we identified
and synthesized a novel reversible LSD1 inhibitor coded
as JL1037, which specifically inhibited LSD1 in cell-free
enzymatic assay with great potency. We further characterized
JL1037 in ex vivo AML cell systems as well as in a mouse
model harboring AML1-ETO translocation to elucidate the
role of JL1037 as an effective anti-leukemia agent.

2VID) as shown in Figure 2A. In our docking experiment,
JL1037 bound LSD1 well. In close proximity to FAD,
JL1037 occupied three important sub-pockets of the active
site as shown in Figure 2B. The spatial complementarity
played a key role in the JL1037 binding to LSD1. Also in
our docking model, JL1037 interacted chemically with
LSD1 favorably. JL1037 formed favorable hydrophobic
interactions with LSD1 and an important hydrogen bond
with the carbonyl oxygen (O4) of FAD. Still more, JL1037
seemed to form favorable charge interactions with LSD1
involving residues Asp553, Asp556, Asp555, and Glu559.
Herein, for the sake of the patent protection, the chemical
structural formula of JL1037 was not shown.
We next evaluated the in vitro inhibitory activity
of JL1037 on LSD1 with LSD1 Fluorimetric Drug
Discovery kit (# BML-AK 544, Enzo Life Science Inc,
USA). JL1037 exhibited good inhibitory potency against
LSD1 with IC50 value of 110 nM (Figure 2C). We also
examined the specificity of JL1037 over other related
monoamine oxidases such as MAO-A and MAO-B as
the previous LSD1 inhibitors were proved to be strong
MAO-A/B inhibitors. We found that the inhibitory
effect of JL1037 on LSD1 was 17.45 and 16.09 fold
stronger than that on MAO-A and MAO-B, respectively
(Table 1), suggesting that JL1037 was a highly specific
LSD1 inhibitor. Then, we evaluated JL1037 inhibitory
activity against LSD1 at cellular level. Representative
AML cell lines THP-1 and Kasumi-1 were treated
with increasing doses of JL1037 ranging from 0 μM to
50 μM for 48 hours. Western blot assay was performed
to determine the effect of JL1037 on the methylation
levels of LSD1 substrates H3K4 and H3K9. In each
cell line, JL1037 treatment didn’t change the expression
level of LSD1, but resulted in detectable increases of
H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 (Figure 2D), whereas the levels
of acetylated H3, H3K9me1, H3K9me2, H3K4me3 and
H3K9me3 remained unchanged. These results suggested
that JL1037 was capable of LSD1 inhibition in AML cell
lines without affecting the acetylation status of those
LSD1 substrates.

RESULTS
LSD1 is highly expressed in AML cells
To investigate whether LSD1 could be a valid
therapeutic target for AML, the expression levels of LSD1
in a variety of AML cell lines were compared with that of
normal bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) by
real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot.
The results clearly demonstrated that LSD1 expression at
both mRNA and protein level was significantly higher in
majority of AML cell lines, especially in Kasumi-1, THP-1
and K562 cells, compared with that of normal BMMNCs,
which was hardly detectable (Figure 1A and 1B).

JL1037 inhibits AML cell proliferation by
blocking cell cycles and inducing caspase-3
dependent apoptosis

JL1037 is a novel LSD1 specific inhibitor
Increasing numbers of investigators have
demonstrated LSD1 as a potentially promising drug target
for AML. Herein, we successfully synthesized a novel
LSD1 inhibitor, JL1037, which was originated from
computational screening and designed using mainly the
DOCK module of the MOE software (CCG, Montreal,
Canada). Molecular docking sampled conformations of
small molecules in a protein binding site and found which
of those shapes fit well both spatially and chemically to the
protein binding site. In this study, docking was implemented
with the crystal structure of the LSD1 enzyme in complex
with CoREST and a substrate-like peptide (PDB ID:

We next explored the biological impacts of JL1037
on AML cells. MTS assay was performed to evaluate the
anti-proliferative activity of JL1037. JL1037 strongly
inhibited the growth of THP-1 and Kasumi-1 cells in a
time and dose dependent manner. The IC50 values of
48 hours were (30.3 ± 2.22) μM and (19.42 ± 3.02) μM,
respectively (Figure 3A). We further tested whether
JL1037 inhibited cell proliferation by blocking cell cycles
or inducing apoptosis. Cell cycle assay was performed
with propidium iodide (PI) staining and the result showed
that a 24-hour treatment of JL1037 arrested cell cycle at S

phase when used at lower doses (10 ~ 30) μM, however,
when the doses increased to (40 ~ 50) μM, the cell cycle
would be blocked at G0/G1 phase (Figure 3B). Apoptosis
analysis demonstrated that JL1037 induced cell apoptosis
in a dose-dependent manner ranging from 10% ~ 90%
in THP-1 cells and 10% ~ 60% in Kasumi-1 cells when
treated with (10 ~ 50) μM for 48 hours (Figure  3C).
Morphology analysis with Wright-Giemsa staining
displayed typical apoptotic characteristics of the treated
AML cells such as karyopyknosis, reduced ratio of
nucleus to cytoplasm, nuclear fragmentation with intact
cell membrane and vacuolar degeneration (Figure 3D).
The mechanism underlying the cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis induced by JL1037 was explored. Cell
cycle-related proteins P21, P27 and P57 were examined
by Western blot after 24-hour treatment of the cell lines
with JL1037. As shown in Figure 4A, P21 and P57
were significantly up-regulated while P27 remained
unchanged. Apoptosis markers such as cleaved caspase-3
and cleaved PARP were also examined after treatment
with JL1037 for 48h. Both markers were elevated as the
concentrations of JL1037 increased and became more
evident when concentration increased to 30 μM or higher
(Figure 4B). Bcl-2 family members, the key components
of mitochondrial pathway were further investigated. The
results demonstrated that the pro-apoptotic protein Bax
increased in both cell lines accompanied by the decrease
of anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-XL. However, Bcl-2 was
down-regulated only in Kasumi-1 cells (Figure 4C).

The conversion of LC3-I into LC3-II is an essential
step in autophagy and the number of LC3-II puncta
represents the number of autophagosomes. Western blot
assay showed that JL1037 significantly enhanced the
expression of LC3-II even at the concentration of 10 μM
(Figure 5B). Immunofluorescent staining for LC3-II
further revealed that the number of LC3-II puncta in
cytoplasm significantly increased in JL1037 treated cells
in comparison with the non-treated controls (Figure 5C).
Previous studies have demonstrated autophagy could
either serve as a pro-apoptotic or an anti-apoptotic factor in
tumor cells treated with different anticancer drugs [21–23].
To further explore the relationship between apoptosis and
autophagy in AML cells induced by JL1037, THP-1 cells
were treated with JL1037 in the presence or absence of a
specific autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ). As shown
in Figure 5D, the combined treatment with JL1037 and CQ
increased more markedly the proportion of apoptotic cells
than treatment with JL1037 alone. Also the expression
of apoptosis markers such as cleaved PARP and cleaved
caspase-3 increased more significantly when JL1037 and
CQ were used in combination than used alone (Figure 5E).
These results suggested autophagy induced by JL1037
might be an alternative conduit of cell-killing other than
apoptosis in the treated AML cells. The combination of
JL1037 with an autophagy inhibitor would force more
tumor cells to go through apoptosis, therefore, further
enhanced the efficacy of LSD1 inhibitors such as JL1037
against leukemia cells.

Inhibition of JL1037 induced cell autophagy
enhances apoptosis of AML cells

JL1037 induces apoptosis and autophagy in
primary AML cells

Autophagy, a kind of non-apoptotic programmed cell
death, can be induced by many cytotoxic compounds. In
present study, to explore whether autophagy was involved
in the process of cell death induced by JL1037, we utilized
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to analyze
the ultrastructure of AML cells treated by JL1037. Both
autophagosomes and autolysosomes were clearly observed in
THP-1 and Kasumi-1 cells after being treated with 30 μM of
JL1037 for 48 hours and neither was seen in untreated cells
(Figure 5A). Under TEM examination, we also observed
features of mitochondrial apoptosis in JL1037 treated cells
such as mitochondrial swelling and degeneration, which
were consistent with our apoptotic biomarker analyses
shown in Figure 4C that JL1037 induced apoptosis through
mitochondrial apoptosis pathway (Figure 5A).

We further examined the effects of JL1037 on
human primary AML cells. BMMNCs from newly
diagnosed AML patients were collected and treated with
increasing doses of JL1037 for 48 hours. Apoptosis assay
was then performed and the relative apoptosis rate was
used to normalize apoptosis between different individuals.
BMMNCs from healthy donors were also analyzed to
evaluate the JL1037 specific killing effect on AML cells.
As shown in Figure 6A, the proportion of apoptotic cells
increased with the concentration of JL1037 in AML
samples, while BMMNCs from healthy donors were
slightly affected. Apoptosis of primary AML cells was
confirmed by Western blot analysis of cleaved caspase 3
and cleaved PARP after the treatment with JL1037 for
48 hours (Figure 6B). The effects of JL1037 on CD34+

hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells were also examined.
CD34+ cells were isolated from fresh umbilical cord blood
samples with immunomagnetic beads and treated with
different concentrations of JL1037 for 48 h, the percentage
of apoptotic cells was determined with flow cytometry.
The results showed that JL1037 induced apoptosis of
CD34+ cells evidently at the high concentration of 50 μM,
suggesting JL1037 at high concentrations might have toxic
effect on hematopoietic cells (Figure 6C). Next, the role of
autophagy response induced by JL1037 was also evaluated
on primary AML cells. Treatment of AML cells with
JL1037 in the presence or absence of autophagy inhibitor

chloroquine (CQ) demonstrated that combination of the
two compounds had better inhibitory effect than either of
the single compound alone (Figure 6D).

effects of JL1037, the survival time of the transplantable

result of drug toxicity (Figure 7D).The median survival
time of PBS group, 2.5 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg JL1037 group
was 26, 27, 29 days, respectively. We monitored the

any side effects of JL1037 on the general conditions of the
tested mice. A slight degree of weight loss was observed
in both dosages of JL1037 treated groups, but not in the

JL1037 might also have some toxic effects along with
anti-leukemia effects in vivo.

activity in intracellular environment [25]. Other associated
factors such as CoREST and HDACs may influence the
activity of LSD1 to demethylate nucleosomal substrates.
LSD1 inhibitors are effective in a panel of leukemia
cells, especially those harboring MLL-AF9 and RUNX1RUNX1T1 translocations [17, 26]. THP-1 and Kasumi-1
cells with high LSD1 expression relative to normal
BMMNCs were selected for the evaluation of JL1037 as
an anti-leukemic agent (Figure 1). JL1037 reduced cell
viability of THP-1 and Kasumi-1 cells through blocking
cell cycle and inducing apoptosis. The likely mechanism
could be explained by the upregulation of CDK inhibitors,
P21 and P57 (Figure 4A), which negatively regulated cell
cycle progression through inhibiting the activity of cyclin/
CDK complexes [27]. The apoptotic effect of JL1037 were
probably through mitochondrial death pathway, as revealed
by an increase of pro-apoptotic protein Bax and a decrease
of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-XL (Figure 4C) [28].
Morphological changes such as mitochondrial swelling
and degeneration were consistent with the above findings
(Figure 5A). Interestingly, the efficacy of JL1037
toward AML cells was not seen with normal BMMNCs
from healthy donors (Figure 6A). However, CD34+
hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell was not spared by the
inhibition of JL1037 due to its high expression of LSD1
as shown in Figure 6C. This finding further demonstrates
LSD1 plays essential roles in stem cell maintenance and
is consistent with previously reported myelosuppression
caused by LSD1 inhibitors [17]. Therefore, side effects
such as anemia and thrombocytopenia warrant close
monitoring during the early development and later on
human trials of LSD1 inhibitors.
Autophagy, a catabolic process which helps cells
to maintain normal homeostasis and survive against
cellular stress, can be induced by many chemotherapeutic
drugs in leukemia treatment, such as daunorubicin,
dasatinib, HDACi, As2O3 and ATRA [21–23, 29, 30].
In present study, we first reported that autophagy could
be activated by a LSD1 inhibitor in AML cells. We
found that treatment with JL1037 could induce dosedependent autophagy responses in AML cells (Figure
5). However, the exact role of autophagy in antileukemic therapy remains controversial. On one hand,
autophagy induced by chemotherapeutic drugs are
cytoprotective and associated with chemoresistance by
activation of ERK in myeloid leukemia cells [22, 23].
On the other hand, autophagy induced by ATRA and/
or As2O3 contributes significantly to the degradation of
oncoproteins such as PML/RARα and BCR-ABL and the
regulation of therapy-induced differentiation in the case
of acute promyelocytic leukemia [30–33]. In this study,
we found that JL1037 induced autophagy even at lower
dosages than that for cell apoptosis (Figures 3C, 4B, 5B),
autophagy inhibitor CQ enhanced the apoptotic effect of
JL1037 (Figure 5D, 5E). As CQ alone was seen apoptotic
itself in our study (Figure 5D, 5E), it remains unclear

DISCUSSION
High LSD1 expression correlates with poor
prognosis in various kinds of malignancies [13, 24] and
has been demonstrated an essential regulator of LSC.
Inhibition of LSD1 abrogates clonogenic potential and
induces differentiation of both murine and primary human
MLL leukemia cells [17]. Despite the progresses made in
recent years in AML treatment with chemotherapy and
targeted therapeutics, the survival rate of AML patients
remains far from satisfactory, the high recurrence rate
of AML patients presents a huge challenge and unmet
medical need, successfully targeting LSD1 with small
molecules will no doubt provide a novel approach for
treating AML patients, mainly by preventing the recurrence
of AML patients due to more effective control of LSCs.
Up to date, rapid progresses have been made in
the development of irreversible LSD1 inhibitors with
at least 2 compounds entering early clinical stage,
whereas, the development of reversible inhibitors lags
behind largely due to lack of a clear structure–activity
relationship (SAR) and a small number of highly
selective and potent compounds. In the present study,
we disclosed a novel, potent LSD1 inhibitor JL1037
and evaluated the therapeutic effect of JL1037 on AML
with both in vitro and in vivo experiments. JL1037 was
identified from computational screening and designed
using the crystal structure of the LSD1 in complex with
CoREST and a substrate-like peptide as docking template
(Figure 2A). JL1037 docked well into the active site of
LSD1 both spatially and chemically through non-covalent
intermolecular interaction, suggesting it is a reversible
inhibitor against LSD1 (Figure 2B). In addition, JL1037
specifically targeted LSD1 without significantly inhibiting
MAO-A and MAO-B, showing its excellent target
selectivity (Figure 2C, Table 1). In cellular experiments,
JL1037 treatment resulted in an accumulation of
H3K4Me1 and H3K4Me2 modifications (Figure 2D),
which suggested it could effectively target LSD1 in
AML cells. However, the IC50 value of JL1037 in cellular
experiments was 200~300-fold higher than that in cell-free
enzyme assay (Figure 2C, Table 1, Figure 3A) . This was
possibly due to the limited cell membrane permeability
of this compound and the complex regulation of LSD1

whether the enhanced apoptotic effect of JL1037 was a
synergy or a forced increase due to the specific block of
autophagy by CQ. Similar results were seen with primary
leukemic samples directly obtained from leukemic
patients (Figure 6D). Nevertheless, the observation of
the enhanced apoptotic effect of JL1037 by CQ indicates
that combination treatment with an autophagy inhibitor
will improve the anti-leukemic efficacy of LSD1
inhibitors. Due to the low bioavailability (5%, data not
shown) of JL1037, once daily intravenous injection of
the compound was applied for the in vivo efficacy tests
in a murine leukemia model co-expressing AML1-ETO
and HyC-KITD816V. JL1037 significantly suppressed the
proliferation of the peripheral leukemia cells and slightly
prolonged the survival time of leukemia mice compared
with PBS treated control mice (Figure 7B, 7D). The
relatively low efficacy observed in the animal study vs the
strong effects observed in the cell study could probably

be explained by short half-life of JL1037 (1 hour, data
not shown) and the dose limiting toxicities. Body weight
loss in several mice in high dose group and two animal
deaths were observed in the same group (Figure 7C, 7D).
The nature and extent of the toxicity were not yet fully
investigated at this stage of development. Further
optimization of the compound series is warranted in terms
of the improvement of metabolic stability, toxicity profile
and the in vivo efficacy.
In summary, the novel LSD1 inhibitor JL1037
exhibited strongly anti-leukemia effect on AML cell lines
and primary AML cells, and also significantly prolonged
survival time of leukemia mouse harboring AML1-ETO
translocation. Co-treatment with an autophagy inhibitor
could achieve superior apoptotic effect than JL1037
alone. JL1037 represents a promising chemical series, out
of which more successful investigational drug candidates
may be developed.

umbilical cord blood samples and were cultured in IMDM
supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 ng/ml SCF, 50 ng/ml
TPO, and 100 ng/ml Flt-3L at 37°C in 5% CO2. All human
samples used in experiment were collected under informed
consent from the participating subjects.

LSD1 activity assay
LSD1 enzyme inhibition assay was performed with
LSD1 Fluorimetric Drug Discovery kit (# BML-AK544,
Enzo Life Science Inc, USA) modified according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, in each well of a 384well microplate, add 15 μl Mix A containing 1.5 μl LSD1
(0.1 μg/μl) and 0.5 μl HRP stock solutions and 13 μl
assay buffer. Then, add in each well 1 μl of serial diluted
compound solutions such as JL1037 (Each compound was
serial diluted in 8 different concentrations in assay buffer
from 0 to 10 μM) and incubate at room temperature for
5 min. Add in each well 15 μl of Mix B containing 1.2 μl
of H3K4me2 (0.5 mM) and 0.4 μl of Cellestial® (100X)
stock solutions and 13.4 μl LSD1 assay buffer. Tap the
microplate and read immediately the fluorescent signals in
kinetic mode of the samples in Beckman Coulter DTX 880
Multimode Detector (535 nm and 595 nm for excitation
and emission wavelengths, respectively).The assay results
were plotted with Prism GraphPad.

MTS assay
Cell growth inhibitory rates were measured by using
CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Assay (Promega, USA).
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (2 × 104 cells/well) in
100 μl volume and treated with various concentrations of
JL1037 for 24, 48 and 72 hours. At the end of culture, 20
μl MTS reagent was added. Then the cells were incubated
at 37ºC for an additional 2 h and the absorbance was
measured by Synergy H4 Hybrid Microplate Reader
(Biotek, USA) at the wavelength of 490 nm.

MAO-A and MAO-B inhibition assay
MAO-A and MAO-B enzymes were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and the
inhibition assay was tested with Promega MAO-Glo™
Assay kit (# V1401, Madison, WI, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The luminescent signals were
detected with Beckman Coulter DTX 880 Multimode
Detector and the results were analyzed with Prism GraphPad.

In vivo studies using an AML1-ETO & C-KIT
leukemia mouse model

Transcriptase (Life technologies, USA). qRT-PCR
analysis for the expression of LSD1 was performed
on the ABI PRISM 7500real-time PCR system with
SYBR Green PCR kit (Takara, Japan) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Primers for LSD1 were
5′-GCTCGGGGCTCTTATTCCTA-3′ (forward) and
5′-CCCAAAAACTGGTCTGCAAT-3′ (reverse). Human
GAPDH was used as an internal control.

The AML1-ETO & C-KIT leukemia mouse model
was previously established by our laboratory [34].
For in vivo study, 6~8 week female C57BL/6 mice
were exposed to sub-lethal of radiation (450 cGy) and
transplanted with 5 × 105 GFP+ spleen cells from the third
generation leukemia mouse. The mice were monitored for
10 days and then randomly divided into three groups: PBS
group, low-dose JL1037 (2.5 mg/kg.d) group and highdose JL1037 (5 mg/kg.d) group. Each group included
8 mice. The intraperitoneal administrations of drugs were
initiated on day 10 after transplantation. During a 10-day
administration period, the percentage of GFP+ cells in
peripheral blood was measured by flow cytometry every
three days to assess the development of leukemia. Body
weight was measured every two days to evaluate drug
toxicity. The overall survival of each group was calculated
from the date of transplantation to the date of death. All
animal experiments were performed under protocols
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Peking Union Medical College.

Western blot assay
Following the drug treatments, cells were collected
and resuspended in RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime, China)
and lysed by ultrasonic instrument. Then equal protein
amount of the cell extracts was analyzed on a 12%
SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto PVDF
membranes. Membranes were blotted with primary
antibodies targeting the following proteins: LSD1 (Sangon
Biotech, Shanghai, China), pan-acetyl-H3 (Millipore,
USA), Mono-Methyl-Histone H3 (Lys4), Di-MethylHistone H3 (Lys4), Tri-Methyl-Histone H3 (Lys4), MonoMethyl-Histone H3 (Lys9), Di-Methyl-Histone H3 (Lys9),
Tri-Methyl-Histone H3 (Lys9), PARP [poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase], Caspases-3, P21, P27, P57, Bcl-xL, Bcl2, Bax and LC3B (all from Cell Signaling Technology,
USA). β-actin (Abcam, USA) and Histone H3 (Abcam,
USA) were used as internal controls. Then, membranes
were incubated in HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
and visualized using the HRP Substrate (Millipore, USA)
by Image Quant LAS-4010 system (GE Healthcare, USA).

Statistical analysis
All experiments in this study were conducted at
least three times. IC50 values of MTS assay was calculated
using SPSS software (version 16.0). The comparisons
were performed by Student’s t-test analysis using
GraphPad Prism (version 5.0). The lifespan of mice was
analyzed by Kaplan-Meier methods and a log-rank test.
P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Immunofluorescence analysis
Treated cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 for
10 min and blocked with PBS containing 2% goat serum
for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated
with an anti-LC3B primary antibody (Cell Signaling
Technology, USA) overnight at 4°C, washed three times
with PBS and stained with an Alexa 488-labeled donkey
anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (BioLegend, USA )
2 h at room temperature in darkness. Nuclei were stained
with DAPI for visualization. Fluorescence images were
taken on a spinning disk confocal microscope using a
100X oil-immersion objective. Autophagy was evaluated
by the formation of punctate fluorescent structures.
