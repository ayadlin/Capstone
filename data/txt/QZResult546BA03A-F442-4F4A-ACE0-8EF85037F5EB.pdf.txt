ABSTRACT
Long-term exposure to airborne PM2.5 is associated with increased lung cancer risk
but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We characterized global microRNA and
mRNA expression in human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to PM2.5 organic extract
and integrally analyzed microRNA-mRNA interactions. Foci formation and xenograft
tumorigenesis in mice with NIH3T3 cells expressing genes targeted by microRNAs were
performed to explore the oncogenic potential of these genes. We also detected plasma
levels of candidate microRNAs in subjects exposed to different levels of air PM2.5 and
examined the aberrant expression of genes targeted by these microRNAs in human
lung cancer. Under our experimental conditions, treatment of cells with PM2.5 extract
resulted in downregulation of 138 microRNAs and aberrant expression of 13 mRNAs
(11 upregulation and 2 downregulation). In silico and biochemical analyses suggested
SLC30A1, SERPINB2 and AKR1C1, among the upregulated genes, as target for miR182 and miR-185, respectively. Ectopic expression of each of these genes significantly
enhanced foci formation in NIH3T3 cells. Following subcutaneous injection of these cells
into nude mice, fibrosarcoma were formed from SLC30A1- or SERPINB2-expressing cells.
Reduced plasma levels of miR-182 were detected in subjects exposed to high level of
PM2.5 than in those exposed to low level of PM2.5 (P = 0.043). Similar results were seen for
miR-185 although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.328). Increased
expressions of SLC30A1, SERPINB2 and AKR1C1 were detected in human lung cancer.
These results suggest that modulation of miR-182 and miR-185 and their target genes
may contribute to lung carcinogenesis attributable to PM2.5 exposure.

species [2–5]. It has been shown that PM2.5 can induce
genetic and epigenetic changes in the airway tissues [6–10].
Some previous studies have characterized the effects of
PM2.5 on the human airway epithelial transcriptome and
found that PM2.5 may induce the expression of airway genes
involved in oxidative stress, xenobiotic metabolism and
oncogenesis, but suppress the expression of genes involved
in immune response and tumor suppression [11–13]. These

findings indicate that the changes in gene expression in
airway tissues may reflect host response to and damage
from PM2.5. However, the mechanism underlying these gene
expression changes and their consequences remains to be
further elucidated.
MicroRNAs are a large family of post-transcriptional
regulators of gene expression and they have been predicted
to control the activity of about 50% of all protein-coding
genes in mammals. It has been suggested that microRNAs
participate in the regulation of almost every cellular process
and the change in their expression are associated with many
human diseases [14]. MicroRNA expression has been shown
to be altered by exposure to air pollutants including PM2.5.
One previous study reported an association between exposure
to PM2.5 and downregulation of several select microRNAs in
elderly men [15]. Another study showed that single nucleotide
polymorphisms in microRNA-processing genes modify
the association between ambient pollutants including PM2.5
and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular
cell adhesion molecule-1 levels, which are associated with
atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease [16]. These
findings imply that altered microRNA expression may play a
role in PM2.5-induced diseases. However, up to date, there is
little experimental evidence showing the effects of exposure
to airborne PM2.5 on microRNA expression in cells and its
biological consequences.
In this study, we hypothesized that components of
airborne PM2.5 may alter microRNA expression resulting
in deregulation of their target oncogenes, which in turn
may lead to carcinogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we first
examined the effects of PM2.5 on whole-genome microRNA
expression in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells. We
then identified protein-coding genes that may be targeted by
PM2.5-modulated microRNAs. Furthermore, we investigated
the phenotypic changes in mouse NIH3T3 cells ectopically
and stably expressing these microRNA-targeted genes. We
also detected the plasma levels of the candidate microRNAs
in subjects exposed to different levels of ambient airborne
PM2.5, and examined the expression of these microRNAtargeted genes in human lung cancer. Here we show that
exposure to PM2.5 suppressed some microRNA expression
in vitro and in vivo. The suppression of these microRNAs
elevated expression of their target genes that may cause
neoplastic transformation in NIH3T3 cells. Low plasma
levels of candidate microRNAs and aberrant expression of
their target genes were detected in human subjects exposed
to higher levels of airborne PM2.5 and lung cancer tissues,
respectively.

aberrantly expressed (11 upregulated and 2 downregulated)
in HBE cells exposed to dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)
extracts of PM2.5 compared with those in cells without
exposure (Figure 1a). These genes are functionally
involved in xenobiotic metabolism (e.g., CYP1A1,
CYP4F11, AKR1C1, MT1X, TXNIP, SLC30A1 and
SLC30A2), immunoregulatory or inflammatory response
(e.g., IL24, IL1RL1, IL1B, CCL5 and SERPINB2) and
other (EID3). Meanwhile, we identified 138 microRNAs
aberrantly expressed in exposed cells compared with
unexposed cells and all of these microRNAs were
downregulated (Figure 1b). We then examined the
correlation between the expression of microRNAs and
mRNAs to predict the potential targets of microRNAs and
found 3 genes, SLC30A1, SERPINB2 and AKR1C1, whose
expression was inversely correlated with miR-182 and (or)
miR-185 expression (Figure 1c). These results suggested
that SLC30A1, SERPINB2 and AKR1C1 may be regulatory
targets for miR-182 and miR-185. The upregulation of
SLC30A1, SERPINB2 and AKR1C1 and downregulation
of miR-182 and miR-185 in HBE cells exposed to PM2.5
extract detected by microarray were further confirmed by
using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western
blot assays (Supplementary Figure S1a and S1b).

SLC30A1, SERPINB2 and AKR1C1 are bona fide
target genes of miR-182 or miR-185
To test whether SLC30A1, SERPINB2 and AKR1C1
are bona fide targets of miR-182 or miR-185, a series of
assays were conducted. First, we constructed luciferase
reporter plasmids with 3′UTR of the SLC30A1, SERPINB2
and AKR1C1 genes, respectively, in psiCHECK-2 vector.
Transient transfection of these reporter plasmids to
human lung cancer cell lines A549 and H446 with miR182 or miR-185 mimic or microRNA control showed
that transfection with miR-182 significantly reduced
the luciferase activity caused by 3′UTR of SLC30A1 or
SERPINB2 while transfection with miR-185 significantly
reduced luciferase activity caused by 3′UTR of AKR1C1
(all P < 0.05). The reduction of luciferase activity was
in a microRNA concentration-dependent manner in
both A549 and H446 cells and when the microRNA
inhibitor was presented, the reduction was completely
rescued (Figure 2a, 2b and 2c). We next constructed
luciferase reporter plasmids with 3′UTR of SLC30A1,
SERPINB2 or AKR1C1 mutated in the core microRNA
binding sites by site-directed mutagenesis (Figure 2e).
Transfection of these plasmids with miR-182 or miR185 mimic showed no significant change in luciferase
activity compared with transfection of these plasmids
with microRNA control (Figure 2d), suggesting that the
interactions between the two microRNAs and 3′UTR of
three target genes are sequence-specific. Furthermore, the
significant suppression of both endogenous mRNA and
protein expression of SLC30A1, SERPINB2 or AKR1C1

Reduced expression of miR-182 and miR-185 in
human subjects exposed to PM2.5

in A549 and H446 cells was verified by transfection of
cells with miR-182 or miR-185 mimic (all P < 0.01), and
this microRNA-induced suppression of gene expression
could be rescued when the specific miRNA inhibitor was
co-transfected (Figure 3a–3c). These results provided
further evidence that SLC30A1, SERPINB2 and AKR1C1
are respective bona fide target genes of miR-182 or miR185 in human cells.

Plasma miR-182 and miR-185 were measured in
109 subjects living at the same region (Wuhan, China) but
exposed to different levels of PM2.5 and PM10 monitored
by personal sampler for 24 h. The median levels of
individuals’ exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 were 124.8 μg/
m3 and 179.3 μg/m3, respectively, with the ranges of 18.7
to 274.2 μg/m3 for PM2.5 and 39.8 to 383.3 μg/m3 for PM10
(Supplementary Table S1). We then separately stratified all
subjects into low exposure (≤124.8 μg/m3 PM2.5 or ≤179.3
μg/m3 PM10) and high exposure (>124.8 μg/m3 PM2.5 or >
179.3 μg/m3 PM10) groups based on the median levels of
PM2.5 or PM10 exposure. The results showed that median
plasma levels of miR-182 were significantly decreased
in subjects exposed to high levels of PM2.5 and PM10
compared with that in subjects exposed to low levels of
PM2.5 (0.166 versus 0.411, P = 0.043) and PM10 (0.141
versus 0.457, P = 0.007), respectively. For miR-185, the
reduced levels in subjects with high exposure compared
with those with low exposure were also observed although
the differences were not statistically significant (Table 1).

Overexpression of SLC30A1 or SERPINB2
evokes neoplastic transforming in NIH3T3 cells
Mouse NIH3T3 cells ectopically and stably
expressing SLC30A1, SERPINB2 or AKR1C1
were established (Figure 4a) to test the neoplastic
transforming activity of these genes. We first conducted
foci formation assay and found that colony number
(mean ± SE) of cells with ectopic expression of each
of SLC30A1 (389.3 ± 10.7, P = 0.002), SERPINB2
(370 ± 9.1, P = 0.003) or AKR1C1 (354 ± 7.9,
P = 0.006) was significantly greater than that of cells
with vector control (289.7 ± 9.1) (Figure 4b). We then
examined tumorigenesis of these NIH3T3 cells in vivo
by subcutaneous injection to nude mice. Although no
tumor was found in animals (n = 5) injected with cells
transfected with vector, all animals injected with cells
expressing SLC30A1 (n = 5) or SERPINB2 (n = 4)
developed tumor at the xenograft site within 4 weeks
after injection. However, under the same experimental
conditions, injection of cells expressing AKR1C1
to mice (n = 5) failed to induce tumor (Figure 5a).
Histological analysis showed that all the tumor
cells had similar morphology and were diagnosed as
fibrosarcoma (Figure 5b). Immunohistochemical
staining confirmed that SLC30A1 and SERPINB2
were highly expressed in tumors induced by NIH3T3
cells transfected with human SLC30A1 or SERPINB2,
respectively (Figure 5c).

We further analyzed SLC30A1, SERPINB2 and

retrieved from the TCGA database. It was found that the
median SLC30A1 RNA level in lung tumor tissues was
significantly higher than that in normal tissues (8.459

difference was only occurred in adenocarcinoma but not
in squamous cell carcinoma (Figure 6a). The median

significantly higher than that in normal tissues (4.625

our knowledge, this is the first report comprehensively
examining the effects of PM2.5 organic extract on wholegenome expressions of microRNAs and protein-coding
genes and their association with lung cancer.
Several previous studies have examined PM2.5 and
PM10 on global gene expression profile in vitro in cell
cultures. Despite differences in cell types, microarray
platforms, and PM sources and doses, these experiments
showed commonality in the expression of genes and
pathways such as xenobiotic metabolism, immune
or inflammation, and oxidative stress [11–13]. In the
present study, we identified 13 protein-coding genes
that had 2-fold change in their expression in HBE cells
treated with PM2.5 DMSO extract compared with control
(11 up-regulated and 2 down-regulated). These genes
also are mainly involved in xenobiotic metabolism and
immunoregulatory or inflammatory pathways and some of
them have been reported in the published studies [11–13].
In addition to protein-coding genes, we found aberrant
expression of 138 microRNAs in HBE cells exposed
to PM2.5 DMSO extract under the same experimental
conditions, and all of them were downregulated. Although
the underlying mechanism has yet to be clarified, it is

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we showed that downregulation of miR-182 and miR-185 in HBE cells
exposed to DMSO extracts of PM2.5 resulted in increased
SLC30A1, SERPINB2 and AKR1C1 gene expression and
ectopic expression of these genes can respectively lead
to neoplastic transformation in NIH3T3 cells. We also
detected depressed expression of miR-182 and perhaps
miR-185 in human subjects exposed to high level of
PM2.5 and overexpression of SLC30A1, SERPINB2 and
AKR1C1, which we have first demonstrated to be target
genes of miR-182 and/or miR-185, in human lung cancer
compared with the corresponding normal lung tissues.
These results together suggest that exposure to airborne
PM2.5 may cause depression of some microRNAs, which
results in overexpression of their target oncogenes and
consequently leads to lung carcinogenesis. To the best of

reasonable to speculate that downregulation of microRNA
expression might be necessary for cells to activate
some key genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism,
DNA repair, immune, inflammation and proliferation
pathways to maintain cell survival upon exposure to toxic
environmental chemicals. Similar phenomenon has been
observed in previous studies showing that the expression
of most microRNAs were declined in vivo in human
subjects exposed to ambient PMs [15] or cigarette smoke
[17] or in vitro in cells treated with certain chemical [18].
The most significant finding in the present study
is that we identified at the first time that miR-182 and
miR-185 are target regulators of SLC30A1, SERPINB2 or
AKR1C1 that function as potential oncogenes because they
were able to induce neoplastic transformation in NIH3T3
cells and were overexpressed in human lung cancer. We
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

also observed reduced levels of plasma miR-182 and
perhaps miR-185 in human subjects exposed to high
levels of PM2.5 compared with those exposed to low levels
of PM2.5 residing at the same region, directly connecting
PM2.5 exposure to microRNA expression in vivo. It has
been shown that miR-182 is overexpressed in  many
types of cancer including lung cancer and is thought to
be associated with cancer development and prognosis
[19, 20]. However, little has been known about the effect
of miR-182 on lung cancer initiation. Accumulating
evidence has shown that microRNAs have distinct effects
in different biological contexts. Indeed, miR-182 has also
been shown to act as a tumor suppressor. For example,
miR-182 was reported to suppress lung tumorigenesis
and lung cancer cell proliferation through downregulation
of RGS17 or RASA1 [21, 22]. In another study,

downregulation of miR-182 was shown to contribute to
renal cell carcinoma proliferation via activation of AKT/
FOXO3a signaling pathway [23]. MiR-185 seems to be
a tumor suppressor and is frequently downregulated in
many types of human cancer [24–26]. Taken together,
these results suggest that long-term exposure to PM2.5
may suppress some microRNA expression, which evokes
the activation of certain oncogenes and thus results in
developing malignancies such as lung cancer.
In the present study, we identified SLC30A1,
SERPINB2 and AKR1C1 as potential oncogenes
targeted by miR-182 and (or) miR-185, respectively.
We demonstrated that ectopic and stable expression of
these genes in NIH3T3 cells could induce cell neoplastic
transformation. Intracellular zinc homeostasis, which
plays an important role in maintaining normality of cells,
is tightly controlled by two families of zinc transporters,
SLC39 and SLC30. It has been shown that cytosolic
zinc negatively regulates RAS-mediated signaling and
physiological zinc level is important for maintaining
the inactive state of the RAS pathway [27]. On the
other hand, it was reported that exposure to zinc sulfate
in human prostate cancer cells increased intracellular
levels of zinc, resulting in increased apoptosis, which
could be due to increased levels of BAX or decreased
Bcl-2 and survivin expression [28]. SLC30A1 is a
SLC30 family member acting as primary regulator of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cellular zinc efflux and overexpression of SLC30A1
may disrupts intracellular zinc homeostasis, leading to
cell neoplastic transformation. SERPINB2, encoding
plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 (also known as
PAI-2), is commonly expressed in many types of human
cancer including lung cancer [29]. The expression of
SERPINB2 in human cells can be induced by chemical
carcinogens such as cigarette smoke and dioxin [30–32].
It has been shown that overexpression of SERPINB2 in
keratinocytes enhances papilloma formation in transgenic
mice [33] and knockout of SERPINB2 abrogates
papilloma formation in mice [34]. The findings in these
previous studies support our results that SERPINB2 can
be induced by PM2.5 and ectopic expression of this gene
is implicated in neoplastic transformation in NIH3T3
cells. AKR1C1 gene encodes a member of the aldo/keto
reductase superfamily, which catalyze the conversion of
aldehydes and ketones to generate their corresponding
alcohols. Previous studies showed that in human lung
cell lines, AKR1C1 and AKR1A1 also play an important
role in the metabolic activation of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, a major component in PM2.5, which
may contribute to the causation of human lung cancer
[35]. In fact, it has been documented that AKR1C
family including AKR1C1 are able to drive neoplastic
transformation of NIH3T3 cells [36], which is generally
consistent with our results in the present study, although

we failed to induce tumor in nude mice with transformed
NIH3T3 cells having significantly increased colonyforming ability.
The analysis of SLC30A1, SERPINB2 and AKR1C1
levels in human lung specimens from the TCGA database
also revealed the aberrant expression of these genes in
lung cancer tissues compared with paired normal tissues.
Although these results did not provide direct evidence
that the aberrant expression of SLC30A1, SERPINB2 and
AKR1C1 in human lung cancer is caused by exposure to
PM2.5, they did indicate a role in the development of lung
cancer of these genes whose expression can be induced
by PM2.5 organic extract. Interestingly, we found that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the aberrant expression of these genes differed in lung
adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting
that they may function differentially in carcinogenesis of
different lung cancer subtypes. Further studies are needed
to address this issue.
The present study had some limitations. First,
because we used DMSO as solvent to extract PM2.5,
therefore the results reflected only the effects of
components dissolved in DMSO. Since PM2.5 may contain
numerous carcinogens that have different chemical/
physical features depending on the sources of air
pollutants, it would be interesting to investigate the effects
of other components in PM2.5 using other extracts. Second,

although the ectopic expression of SLC30A1, SERPINB2
and AKR1C1 can drive neoplastic transformation
of NIH3T3 cells, whether they can drive neoplastic
transformation of human cells and what are the underlying
mechanisms need to be examined. Furthermore, in
this study, we identified aberrant expression of 138
microRNAs and 13 protein-coding genes and examined
only 2 microRNAs and their 3 target genes; it would
be interesting to investigate the oncogenic potential of
other miRNAs in the future. Lastly, the sample sizes for
investigating the associations between PM2.5 exposure and
plasma miRNAs were relatively small, thus the findings
need further validation with larger sample sizes.

In summary, we have identified a bunch of microRNAs
and protein-coding genes that were aberrantly expressed in
human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to DMSO extracts
of airborne PM2.5. Among them, overexpression of SLC30A1,
SERPINB2 as well as AKR1C1, mediated by downregulation
of miR-182 and (or) miR-185, can induce neoplastic
transformation in NIH3T3 cells. Depression of plasma miR182 and miR-185 in subjects exposed to high levels of PM2.5
and overexpression of SLC30A1, SERPINB2 and AKR1C1
in human lung cancer tissues were detected. These results
suggest that altered expression of microRNAs and their target
oncogenes may contribute to the development of lung cancer
attributable to airborne PM2.5.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

CO2. PM2.5 extract was added to the cell culture at a final
concentration of 0.45 mg/ml, a dose that allows 90% of
HBE cells alive after exposure for 24 h. Cells treated with
equal amount of DMSO served as solvent control.

Study subjects and individual monitoring of
airborne PM exposure
A pilot study of 109 subjects with the availability
of personal 24-h exposure to ambient PM2.5 and PM10
and blood were recruited from a community-based,
prospective cohort study conducted between April and
May of 2011 in Wuhan City, China [37]. These subjects
resided in two distinct communities of Wuhan City;
one is located in the urban district and the other is in
the suburb. All subjects have been living in the sampling
buildings for >5 years and aged >40 years, free of
chronic diseases based on physical examination [37].
Each individual was interviewed by using a structure
questionnaire including tobacco smoking, alcohol use,
and environment exposure history. Twenty four-hour
exposure of subjects to PM2.5 and PM10 was monitored
by using a Model 200 Personal Environmental Monitor
(MSP, Minnesota) and Gilian 5000 pump (Sensidyne,
Florida). PM samples were collected on 37-mm Teflon
filters (LianyiXingtong Apparatus & Instrument, Beijing)
at the flow rate of 2.0 l/min. Before and after sampling,
the filters were weighted after conditioning for 24 h.
A 24-h PM2.5 or PM10 exposure level was calculated to
represent as personal exposure level. At recruitment,
informed consent for the study, use of blood sample and
medical records was obtained from each subject. This
study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
the Huazhong University of Sciences and Technologies
School of Public Health.

Isolation of RNA from plasma, cells and lung
tissues
For plasma, total RNA was isolated from 200  μl
of EDTA-anticoagulated sample according to the
manufacturer’s protocol of the mirVana PARIS miRNA
Isolation Kit (Ambion 1556, Austin, TX). Twenty five
fmol of Caenorhabditis elegans cel-miR-39 (synthesized
by Qiagen) was added to each sample as the internal
control. For HBE cells and lung tissue samples, total
RNA was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA
integrity was assessed using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent,
Santa Clara, CA).

Microarray analysis of mRNA and microRNA
expression
Glue Grant Human Transcriptome Array
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and Human miRNA
Microarray 8 × 60 K platform version 18 (Agilent) were
used to generate whole-genome expression profiles of
mRNAs and microRNAs, respectively. We set a threshold
of 2-fold change (exposed versus control) to obtain mRNA
profile and 1.5-fold change to obtain microRNA profile as
significantly induced or repressed by PM2.5 extract. The
experiments were performed in duplicate. The integrated
mRNA and microRNA expression data were used to
identify the potential microRNA target genes by using
the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software as well as
TargetScan and miRanda databases.

Preparation of PM2.5 extract
Urban atmospheric PM2.5 was collected in Wuhan
City between April and May of 2011 by using a PM2.5
sampler as described above. PM2.5 extract was prepared by
suspending PM2.5 sample in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at
a proportion of 200 mg/ml. The mixture was extracted in an
ultrasonic bath for 30 min and then briefly centrifuged to
obtain the supernatant, which was stored at –40°C until use.

Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of candidate
mRNAs and microRNAs
First-strand cDNA was synthesized with the
Superscript II-reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) using
total RNA as the template. For analysis of microRNAs
from cell lines and tissue samples, polyadenylation was
performed before cDNA synthesis. Quantitative real-time
PCR (qRT-PCR) was accomplished on an ABI Prism
7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA) based on the SYBR Green method and
GAPDH as the internal control. The expression of miR182 and miR-185 was calculated relative to U6 small
nuclear RNA. For analysis of plasma miR-182 and miR185, the input RNA was reverse transcribed using TaqMan
miRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied BioSystems,
Foster City, CA). The miRNA levels were normalized to
cel-miR-39. The gene- and microRNA-specific qRT-PCR
primer pairs are shown in Supplementary Table S2.

Cell culture and treatment
Immortalized human bronchial epithelial (HBE)
cells established in our laboratory [38] were maintained
in serum-free medium. Mouse fibroblast cells (NIH3T3),
human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cells and small-cell
lung cancer (H446) cells, purchased from the Cell Bank of
Type Culture Collection of Chinese Academy of Sciences
Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology
(Shanghai, China), were maintained according to the Cell
Bank’s protocols. Cell lines were characterized by DNA
finger printing analysis using short-tandem repeat markers.
HBE cells (1.5 × 105) were seeded in six-well plates and
allowed to grow for 24 h in an incubator at 37°C with 4%

transfection and luciferase assay

ProteinTech) were used. The membranes were incubated
overnight at 4°C with the primary antibody and the
proteins were then detected with a Phototope-horseradish
peroxidase Western blot detection kit (Cell Signaling
Technology).

The 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of SLC30A1,
SERPINB2, which were generated by PCR, or AKR1C1,
which was synthesized (Genewiz, South Plainfield,
NJ), was subcloned in psiCHECK2 vector (Promega,
Fitchburg, WI) as reporter plasmids. Mutants of these
3′UTR fragments at the microRNA binding seed site were
achieved by using the Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (SBS
Genetech, Beijing). All constructs were restriction-mapped
and sequenced to confirm their authenticity. A549 and H446
cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells per well in 24-multiwell
plates (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and allowed to grow
to 80%–90% confluence. Reporter plasmids (100 ng) with
microRNA mimics or scrambled sequences of microRNA
inhibitors were co-transfected to cells using lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen). Each group had three replicates, and the
experiment was repeated at least three times. Cells were
collected at 24 h after transfection using 100 μl of passive
buffer and Renilla luciferase activity was detected with
Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) in a TD20/20 luminometer (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA);
firefly luciferase activity was also determined to normalize
the activity of Renilla luciferase.

Colony formation assay
NIH3T3 cells with ectopic and stable expression of
human SLC30A1, SERPINB2 or AKR1C1 were plated
evenly onto 10-cm dishes in medium containing 10%
FBS. Cells were fed every three days over 10 days in
culture. Colonies were fixed in cold methanol and stained
with crystal violet.

Xenograft growth of NIH3T3 cells in mice
BALB/c nude mice, aged 6 weeks and purchased
from Shanghai Laboratory Animal Center of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, were allowed to acclimatize to local
conditions for one week and maintained under a 12-h dark,
12-h light cycle with food and water ad libitum. Animals
(5 mice in each group) were injected subcutaneously with
0.1 ml of cell suspension containing 107 cells into the
right flank. When a tumor was palpable, its volume was
measured every other day and calculated according to the
formula, Volume = Length × Width2 × 0.5. All experiments
were performed in accordance with the Institutional
Review Board of the Cancer Institute and Hospital and
national guidelines and regulations.

Expression plasmid construction, lentiviral
production and transduction
The expression plasmids pLVX-SLC30A1, pLVXSERPINB2 and pLVX-AKR1C1 were constructed using
pLVX-IRES-Neo lentiviral vector and full length cDNAs
of human SLC30A1, SERPINB2 generated by PCR (see
Supplementary Table S2 for the primers), or AKR1C1
provided by OriGene Technologies (Rockville, MD). These
expression plasmids were used to generate recombinant
lentiviruses in HEK293T cells by cotransfection with
VSVG, REV and ΔR. Transfection of pLVX-SLC30A1,
pLVX-SERPINB2, pLVX-AKR1C1 or empty pLVX vector
into NIH3T3 cells was done using lipofectamine 2000 DNA
Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen). At 48 h of transfection,
cells were stably selected with G418 and drug-resistant cells
were used for subsequent studies.

Histological and immunohistochemical analysis
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples
were sectioned, stained with hematoxylin and eosin
and analyzed under light microscopy. To investigate
the presence of SLC30A1 or SERPINB2 proteins in
tumor tissues, the rabbit antibody against SERPINB2 or
SLC30A1 (1:500 dilution) was incubated with the tissue
sections at 4°C overnight, which was then detected with
the ABC kit (Pierce).

Retrieval of data from online databases
RNA expression levels of SLC30A1, SERPINB2 and
AKR1C1 in lung cancer and their paired normal tissues
were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database
(TCGA, http://cancergenome.nih.gov/).

Western blotting assay
Western blotting assay was used to detect the protein
expression levels of interest genes in HBE cells exposed to
PM2.5 extract or cells transfected with expression plasmids
containing the interest genes. Protein extract prepared
by detergent lysis was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF membrane
(Millipore, Temecula, CA). Antibodies against SLC30A1
(ab110383, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), SERPINB2 (160351-AP, ProteinTech, Chicago, IL), AKR1C1 (7660-1,
Epitomics, Burlingame, CA) or β-ACTIN (20536-1-AP,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Statistical analysis
The normal distribution of data was tested by the
1-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. The continuous
variables were expressed as mean ± SE or median (25th–
75th quartile). The concentrations of plasma microRNA
expression levels measured by qRT-PCR were normalized

by log2 transformed. Multivariate regression models
were used to evaluate the association between plasma
microRNA levels and PM2.5 or PM10 exposure levels, with
adjustment for covariates including age, gender, smoking
status, drinking status and BMI. All analyses were carried
out using Statistical Analysis System software (version
9.0; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Two-side P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
