ABSTRACT
Primary or acquired resistance to MEK inhibitors has been a barrier to successful
treatment with MEK inhibitors in many tumors. In this study, we analyzed genome-wide
gene expression profiling data from 6 sensitive and 6 resistant cell lines to identify
candidate genes whose expression changes are associated with responses to a MEK
inhibitor, selumetinib (AZD6244). Of 62 identified differentially expressed genes, we
selected Immunoglobulin Transcription Factor 2, also known as transcription factor 4
as a potential drug resistance marker for further analysis. This was because the ITF2 expression increase in resistant cell lines was relatively high and a previous study
has suggested that ITF-2 functions as an oncogene in human colon cancers. We also
established an AZD6244 resistant cell line (M14/AZD-3) from an AZD6244 sensitive M14
cell line. The expression of the ITF-2 was elevated both in primary AZD6244 resistant
cell line, LOX-IMVI and acquired resistant cell line, M14/AZD-3. Targeted silencing
of ITF-2 by siRNA significantly enhanced susceptibility to AZD6244 in resistant cells.
Wnt/β-catenin pathway was activated through direct interaction of p-ERK and GSK3β.
Our results suggest that up-regulation of the ITF-2 gene expression is associated with
cellular resistance to MEK inhibitors, and activation of Wnt signaling pathway through
interaction of p-ERK and GSK3β seems to be a mechanism for increase of ITF-2.

RAS, which activates RAF and then activates mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK), leading
to the phosphorylation and activation of MAPK (originally
called extracellular signal-regulated kinase [ERK]). MEK1

and MEK2 show a unique specificity for ERK1/2 and the
ERKs have wide spectrum substrates, many of which play
a role in promoting cell proliferation and survival [1].
Small-molecule inhibitors of one or more components
of the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway have potential
therapeutic properties for some cancers, particularly those
that have a dysregulated MAPK pathway (for example,
B-RAF-mutated melanoma and K-RAS/B-RAF-mutated
colorectal cancer) [2]. MEK inhibitors inhibit MEK1 and/
or MEK2, homologous dual specificity kinases that share
ERK as their only known catalytic substrate [3]. PD098059
was the first MEK inhibitor to be described [4] and
several other MEK inhibitors have since been developed
in clinical use for various cancers [5]. The Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States recently
approved one of these agents, trametinib for the treatment
of patients with unrespectable or metastatic melanomas
harboring B-RAFV600E or B-RAFV600K mutations, as detected
by an FDA-approved test (https://www.fda.gov/downloads/
drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/guidances/
ucm481951.pdf). AZD6244 (Selumetinib) is a non-ATP
competitive inhibitor and is highly specific for MEK1/2.
Multiple phase 2 studies of this drug have been conducted
in patients with a wide range of cancers [5].
Although recent studies have demonstrated
impressive antitumor activities of MEK inhibitors,
many tumors show intrinsic resistance of these agents.
Reliable biomarkers of susceptibility or resistance to
MEK inhibitors are thus needed to allow tailoring of
individualized treatments with these compounds and
to reduce the risk of unnecessary drug toxicities. It has
been suggested that activating mutations in the B-RAF
gene represent the most important predictive biomarker
for sensitivity to MEK inhibitors [6, 7]. However, early
clinical data have revealed that B-RAF mutant tumors
were not uniformly responsive to MEK inhibitors although
tumors with these mutations seemed to be more sensitive.
[8, 9] Furthermore, the duration of the responses to
MEK inhibitors is reported to be relatively short (median
≤ 5 months) in melanoma [10]. Other biomarkers such as
RAS mutations or ERK activation correlate poorly with the
sensitivity of cells to MEK inhibitors [11, 12].
The NCI-60 is a set of 60 human cancer cell lines
derived from diverse tissues, including brain, blood
and bone marrow, breast, colon, kidney, lung, ovary,
prostate, and skin. These cell lines have now been
subjected to a battery of experiments including extensive
pharmacological characterization analyses via treatment
with over 100,000 chemical compounds, chromosome
karyotyping, and gene expression analysis using various
DNA microarray platforms [13]. The current approaches
to studying the genetic basis of cancer are exploring
substantial components of the expressed genome rather
than focusing on individual genes [14]. Researchers can
now use standards-based repositories such as the Stanford

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Microarray Database and the Gene Expression Omnibus,
which have developed to store and disseminate the results
of microarray experiments [15].
The proto-oncogene β-catenin has been linked to
the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal
carcinoma, lung cancer, malignant breast tumors,
and leukemia through the Wnt-signal transduction
pathway [16] Immunoglobulin Transcription Factor-2
(ITF-2) is one of several specific target genes of T-cell
factor-dependent transcription upon translocation of
β-catenin to the nucleus [17].
In our current study we aimed to screen for novel
response predictive markers for the AZD6244, MEK
inhibitor by analyzing published microarray data from
AZD6244 sensitivity profiling of the NCI-60 cell lines
and also aimed to validate the candidate markers in both
primary and acquired resistance models.

RESULTS
Screening of cancer cell lines for their response
to a MEK inhibitor, AZD6244
We performed assays for the growth response of
a panel of NCI-60 cell lines to 10 μM or less AZD6244
by proliferation assay. On the basis of the response
to AZD6244, we selected 6 sensitive (IC50 ≤ 0.5 µM)
and 6 resistant (IC50 > 5 µM) cell lines (Supplementary
Figure 1). The IC50 values for the 6 resistant cell lines
ranged from 6.032 to 125.9 μM, while the 6 sensitive
cell lines showed IC50 values of less than 0.5 μM (range,
0.02923 to 0.4870 μM). One resistant and 5 sensitive cell
lines harbored a B-RAF mutation; and 1 resistant and
1 sensitive line contained a K-RAS mutation. One resistant
cell line had an N-RAS mutation (Table 1).

Selection of ITF-2 as a potential AZD6244
resistance marker from public microarray data
Following public microarray data acquisition and
analysis, a total of 62 differentially expressed genes
(DEGs) were selected from 12 cell lines (6 AZD6244
resistant; CCRF-CEM, HL-60, K-562, LOX-IMVI, SF295 and SNB-19 vs. 6 AZD6244 sensitive; COLO-205,
SW-620, M14, SK-MEL-28, UACC-257 and UACC-62)
(Supplementary Figure 2). Of these selected genes, 18 were
up-regulated and 44 were down-regulated in AZD6244
resistant cell lines (Supplementary Table 1). Table 2 lists the
top 10 AZD6244 resistant signature genes and we confirmed
the expression using quantitative real-time PCR for these 10
genes (data not shown). We selected the Immunoglobulin
transcription factor-2 (ITF-2) gene because it showed the
strongest upregulation in resistant lines and previous studies
have suggested that this gene is a downstream target of the
Wnt/β-catenin/T-cell factor pathway [18].

Increased expression of ITF-2 in cell lines having
primary or acquired resistance to AZD6244

polymerase (PARP) cleavages following treatment of
AZD6244 (Figure 2B). Western blot demonstrated that the
ITF-2 protein level was elevated in M14/AZD-3 as well
as LOX-IMVI, while it was not in parent M14 cell line
(Figure 2C). ITF-2 protein overexpression in both primary
(LOX-IMVI) and acquired (M14/AZD-3) resistant cell
lines suggested the possible role of ITF-2 in resistance
to AZD6244. In contrast, the levels of RAS/RAF/MEK/
ERK signaling proteins were not significantly changed in
resistant cell lines (M14/AZD-1, M14/AZD-3, and M14/
AZD-4) compared to M14 (Supplementary Figure 4).

The mRNA levels of ITF-2 in AZD6244 resistant
cancer cell lines were found to be significantly higher than
in cell lines sensitive to this inhibitor (Figure 1A). Moreover,
western blot using an anti-ITF-2 monoclonal antibody
(mAb) showed that the ITF-2 protein level was elevated in
5 of 6 AZD6244 resistant cell lines but in only one sensitive
cell line. The p-ERK levels were not significantly associated
with the sensitivity to AZD6244 (Figure 1B).
M14/AZD-3 is 33.4-fold more resistant to AZD6244
compared to parent M14 (Figure 2A). Direct sequencing
demonstrated that both M14 and M14/AZD-3 had
B-RAFV600E mutation, but did not have mutations in MEK1
exon 3 and exon 6 which encompass the validated resistant
alleles (Supplementary Figure  3) [51]. M14/AZD-3
needed higher concentration of AZD6244 to decrease
the p-ERK level and did not induce poly (ADP-ribose)

Suppression of ITF-2 by siRNA in primary and
acquired resistant cell lines
To exam whether ITF-2 overexpression is associated
with the resistance to AZD6244, M14/AZD-3 and LOXIMVI cells were transfected with either 50 nM of control
siRNAs or siRNA against ITF-2 (siITF-2) (Figure 3).

Transfection of siITF-2 into M14/AZD-3 and LOXIMVI effectively reduced ITF-2 protein expression,
but transfection alone did not induce cleavage of PARP
(Figure 3A) or did not inhibit cell proliferation (Figure 3B).
Although the transfection of siITF-2 alone did not
induce the death of AZD6244 resistant cells, it might
alter response of the resistant cells to AZD6244. To test
this hypothesis, we treated AZD6244 resistant cells with
10 μM of AZD6244 for 24 h following transfection of
siITF-2. The Live-Dead cell staining showed that ITF-2
suppression by transfection of siITF-2 dramatically
increased the proportion of dead cells with treatment
of AZD6244 (Figure 4A). Western blot analysis also
demonstrated increased cleavage of procaspase-3 and
PARP with treatment of AZD6244 following transfection
of siITF-2 (Figure 4B).
This phenomenon could also be found in other
primary AZD6244 resistant cell line, human gliomaderived SF-295. The cell line had increased ITF-2 level,

which was effectively suppressed by two different
siRNAs against ITF-2 (siITF-2 #1 and siITF-2 #2)
(Supplementary Figure 5A). The apoptotic and cytotoxic
effects of AZD6244 on SF-295 cells were enhanced by
transfection of both siRNAs as evidenced by inhibition
of phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) and increased cleavage
of PARP in western blot (Supplementary Figure 5B) and
increase of the proportion of dead cells in Live-Dead cell
staining (Supplementary Figure 5C).
These results suggest that the ITF-2 suppression
could enhance the susceptibility to AZD6244 in melanoma
cells with primary or acquired resistance.

Activation of Wnt signaling pathway in primary
and acquired resistant cell lines
Because ITF-2 is known as a downstream target
of Wnt signaling pathway, we examined the pathway
in AZD6244 sensitive cell line (M14) and resistant cell

sensitive cell lines. Statistical significances are calculated by the Mann-Whitney U-test. (B) Equal amounts of total cellular proteins were
subjected to western blot analysis for ITF-2, and phospho-specific and total ERK1/2. ITF-2 was elevated in AZD6244 resistant cell lines

lines (M14/AZD-3 and LOX-IMVI). Translocation
of dephosphorylated β-catenin to the nucleus and
accumulation of phosphorylated Ser9 of GSK3β in
cytosol fraction were found in AZD6244 resistant cell
lines (M14/AZD-3 and LOX-IMVI), but not in AZD6244
sensitive cell line, M14 (Figure 5A). The same findings
were observed in SF-295 (Supplementary Figure 6).
These findings suggest that activation of Wnt signaling
pathway due to inactivation of GSK3β leads to increased
transcription of ITF-2 in AZD6244 resistant cells. Because
GSK3β is known to be phosphorylated at Ser9 by the most
downstream kinase of the classical MAPK cascade, called
ribosome S6 kinase (RSK), [19] we assayed total and
phosphorylated p90RSK (Tyr573). Interestingly, we found
that p90RSK was downregulated in AZD6244 resistant
cell lines (Figure 5B).
We assumed that p-ERK might directly interact
with GSK3β and we performed GST pull-down assay
using pGEX-GSK3β and Glutathione-Sepharose 4B
(GST) beads. GSK3β fused GST bead was interacted with
phosphorylated p90RSK (Tyr573) and ERK (T202/Y204)
in M14 but the interaction did not activate phosphorylation

of GSK3β (S9). In contrast, the bead was interacted with
phosphorylated ERK (T202/Y204) and phosphorylation
of GSK3β (S9) was induced in both resistant cell lines
without p90RSK (Figure 5C). The findings demonstrated
that p-ERK was directly bound to GSK3β, which was
phosphorylated at Ser9, in AZD6244 resistant cell lines
(M14/AZD-3 and LOX-IMVI).

DISCUSSION
Drug resistance, either primary or acquired, is one
of the most challenging aspects of anticancer agents. A
critical component of cancer drug development is the
identification of biomarkers that can be used to predict
resistance to these agents. Biomarker identification is also
important for minimizing patient exposure to potentially
toxic agents for little clinical benefit and to develop
rational approaches for overcoming drug resistance.
Many studies have been under taken to gain an improved
understanding of the mechanisms of cancer drug resistance
and have identified factors that seemed to be associated
with resistance to MEK inhibitors, [20] including MEK1

expression of musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (MAF),
[23] concurrent activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
pathway [24, 25] or the signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway, [26] and an ‘invasive
phenotype’ of transcriptional pathway signatures [27].
In our current study, we obtained evidence that the
over-expression of ITF-2 might be a novel biomarker of
cellular resistance to MEK inhibitors because the mRNA
and protein levels of this gene in AZD6244 resistant cell
lines were significantly elevated and suppression of ITF-2
by siRNA enhanced the susceptibility of AZD6244
resistant cells to this inhibitor. These results were observed
with both primary AZD6244 resistance cell line (LOX-

IMVI) and acquired resistance cell line (M14/AZD),
which was established as a model for acquired resistance
using a sensitive cell line harboring B-RAF mutation. Our
study results might provide a clue to prevent or overcome
the development of acquired resistance to MEK inhibitors,
which is a common and serious problem in real clinical
settings.
The ITF-2 gene (also known as TCF4, E2-2, ME2,
or SEF2) is located on human chromosome 18q21,
consists of 20 exons (exons 1 and 20 are noncoding), and
spans 360 kb. ITF-2 belongs to the class A subfamily of
basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional regulators
[28, 29]. This gene is different from T-cell transcription
factor 4 on human chromosome 10q25.3, which was
previously termed TCF4, but is now designated as TCF7L2.
The ITF-2 gene encodes two splice variants, ITF-2A

and ITF-2B. ITF-2A is a truncated splice variant with a low
transcriptional potency. ITF-2B produces a larger protein,
which is ubiquitously expressed and dimerizes with other
classes of bHLH proteins to regulate tissue-specific gene
expression through E-box sites in various cell types
including myocytes, osteoblasts, B and T lymphocytes, and
neuronal cells [30]. Previous studies have demonstrated
that ITF-2 is a downstream target of the Wnt/β-catenin/
TCF7L2 pathway, which is frequently disrupted in human
cancers [17, 18, 31]. It is also well known that nuclear
transcriptional activity of β-catenin is enhanced upon
sustained oncogenic stimulation by the RAS-MAPK
signaling pathway [32]. Like c-MYC and cyclin D1, ITF-2
functions as an oncogene when deregulated in human
colon cancer or ovarian cancer, [18, 31] although other
studies have reported that the inactivation of ITF-2 may
play a role in early gastric carcinoma progression or in

the colonic adenoma to carcinoma transition [33, 34].
In another earlier study aiming to identify predictive
biomarkers of the response to AZD6244 in colorectal
cancer, members of the Wnt signaling pathway were found
to be highly over-expressed in response to AZD6244 and
shRNA knockdown experiments indicated the functional
involvement of these factors in mediating resistance to
this inhibitor [35]. In our study, we observed increase of
inactive form of GSK3β and translocation of β-catenin to
nucleus in AZD6244 resistant cell lines (M14/AZD3 and
LOX-IMVI), leading to increased transcription of ITF-2.
It has been known that GSK3β is phosphorylated at Ser9
by stress-activated p90RSK [36]. In our study, however,
p90RSK was downregulated in AZD6244 resistant cell
lines and GST pull-down assay showed that p-ERK was
bound to GSK3β, which was phosphorylated at Ser9.
Thus, it is reasonably assumed that p-ERK directly

and activation of Wnt pathway results in the transcription
of ITF-2 gene in AZD6244 resistant cells (Figure 6).
Downstream signals of ITF-2 related to resistance to MEK
inhibitor remain to be studied.
MEK inhibitors have generally shown limited
effectiveness as monotherapeutic agents and combination
regimens are a possible treatment approach to overcome
MEK inhibitor resistance. Indeed, simultaneously
inhibition of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways
has been proposed for melanoma [37]. Moreover, in a
K-RAS mutant lung cancer mouse model, a combination
of a MEK inhibitor at doses below the maximum tolerated
dose with a PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor was found to
suppress the growth of the tumors [38]. In another previous
in vitro study using melanoma cell lines, a high degree
of cross-resistance to a B-RAF inhibitor (vemurafenib)
and a MEK inhibitor (AZD6244) was reported, and
genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR pathway was found to partially or completely
reverse this resistance [39]. Furthermore, a combination
of AZD6244 and an BCL2 inhibitor (ABT-263) was
shown to be synergistic in causing a cell death response
in colon cancer or melanoma cells harboring B-RAF or
RAS mutations, and also to delay the onset of acquired
resistance and in some cases overcome acquired resistance

to AZD6244 [40]. The MAPK pathway is activated by
BCR-ABL in nilotinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML) cells and nilotinib acts synergistically with MEK
inhibitors to kill drug-resistant CML cells both in vitro and
in vivo [41]. The available evidence suggests that cytotoxic
chemotherapeutic agents can activate the MAPK pathway
through diverse processes and that MEK inhibitors
may effectively blocked the activation [42]. It has also
been demonstrated that there are synergistic or additive
effects of MEK inhibitors in combination with various
cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. In vitro studies using
leukemia cell lines have reported that MEK inhibitors
enhance the cytotoxic effects of cytarabine or doxorubicin
[43, 44]. Similar enhanced effects of MEK inhibitors in
combination with cytotoxic drugs have been observed
in xenograft tumor models of solid cancers including
melanoma, [45] and biliary, [46] colon, [47,  48] lung,
[48] pancreatic [48] or hepatocellular carcinoma  [49].
When MEK inhibitors are combined with traditional
chemotherapeutic agents, drug scheduling may have a
critical disease management role because MEK inhibitors
cause cell cycle arrest whereas many standard cytotoxic
agents kill actively dividing cancer cells [46, 48]. In our
current study, a combination of AZD6244 and ITF-2
siRNA induced cell death in AZD6244 resistant cell
lines, although the magnitude of enhanced susceptibility

nucleus and the association of β-catenin and T-cell factor results in the transcription of ITF-2 gene, one of Wnt target genes.

to AZD6244 was not adequate for clinical application,
probably due to the only partial suppression of ITF-2
expression by siRNA. Wnt/ β-catenin pathway inhibitors
might suppress ITF-2 more effectively and may provide a
novel combination approach for MEK inhibitors.
In summary, we have identified the ITF-2 gene
as a novel resistance biomarker for an MEK inhibitor,
AZD6244. The mRNA and protein levels of ITF-2
were found to be significantly elevated in cell lines
with primary or acquired resistance to AZD6244 and
a targeted silencing of ITF-2 by siRNA significantly
enhanced the susceptibility of primary resistant cells
(LOX-IMVI) and acquired resistant cells (M14/AZD-3) to
AZD6244. Activation of Wnt signaling pathway through
direct interaction of p-ERK and GSK3β seems to be a
mechanism for increase of ITF-2.

luminescence plate reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA).
The concentration of AZD6244 required for 50% growth
inhibition was scored as the half maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50) values.

Public microarray data acquisition and data
analysis
To identify candidate genes associated with resistant
or sensitive responses to AZD6244 genome-wide gene
expression profiling data from Affymetrix HG-U133A
chips were downloaded from the Gene Expression
Omnibus (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo). The chip data
were analyzed with RNA-eXpress (www.rnaexpress.org)
using its default analysis settings and a quintile
normalization method. Analyses of preprocessed data were
performed using BRB-ArrayTools (linus.nci.nih.gov/BRBArrayTools.html). A two-sample t-test was performed
between sensitive and resistant groups at P  < 0.005 to
select for DEGs between the two groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cancer cell lines

Genomic DNA PCR and direct sequencing

The NCI-60 cell lines were purchased from the
Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and were cultured
at 37°C in 5% CO2 in RPMI-1640 medium containing
5% or 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Information
regarding the mutation status of the B-RAF, K-RAS, and
N-RAS genes of each cell line was obtained from the
Wellcome Trust Sanger institute website (http://cancer.
sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/sample/overview?id=1295340, http://
cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/sample/overview?id=1238117).

Genomic DNA was purified using the QIAamp DNA
mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). All PCR amplifications
were performed with HotStar HiFidelity Polymerase kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. B-RAF codon V600 was PCR amplified using
following primers: 5′GGCCAAAAATTTAATCAGTGGA3′
and 5′ AGCCTCAATTCTTACCATCC3′. 50 μl PCR
reactions were 35 cycles at 95°C for 30 sec, 56°C
for 30 sec, 72°C 45 sec. The MEK1 genetic mutation
was accomplished using published methods [51]. The
sequencing primers were the same as the PCR forward
primers and the sequencing reaction was performed using
standard-seq single (Macrogen Inc. Seoul. Kr).

Establishment of an AZD6244 resistant
melanoma cell line
Human melanoma M14 cell line was sensitive to
AZD6244 in vitro. M14 cells were continuously exposed to
gradually increasing concentration of AZD6244 up to 500
nM. An AZD6244 resistant subclone was isolated using
limiting dilution method and AZD6244 resistant cell lines
(M14/AZD-1, M14/AZD-3, and M14/AZD-4) could be
established. In most experiments, M14/AZD-3 was used.

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Total RNAs were extracted using TRIzol® Reagent
(Invitrogen) and converted into cDNA using a QuantiTect
Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The
transcript levels were quantified via the SYBR Green real
time PCR method using LightCycler® 480 SYBR Green
I Master Mix (Roche Applied Science) on a Roche-480
system using primer sets (Supplementary Table 2). After
an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 5 min, amplification
occurred over 45 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s,
annealing at 60°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 30 s.
Each sample was tested in triplicate, and gene expression
levels were normalized to those of beta-actin.

Cell proliferation assay
Cell viability was assessed by the luminescent-based
CellTiter-Glo system (Promega, Madison, WI) and Cell
counting kit -SK (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc.
Rockville, MD) in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, cells were plated at 1,000–3,000
per well in a 96-well opaque plate and were incubated
in complete growth medium. Cells were treated with
various concentrations of MEK1/2 inhibitor (AZD6244),
which was synthesized by Chemizon (Seongnam,
Korea) and prepared as a 50 mmol/L stock solution
in DMSO. After 48 h, cell viability was determined by
measuring luminescent signals with a VICTOR™ X Light

Inhibition of gene expression by siRNA
transfection
The siRNA was used for targeted silencing
of ITF-2. Because off-target activity of siRNA may

complicate the interpretation of phenotypic effects
in gene silencing, two kinds of ITF-2 siRNA’s were
used for the experiments: siITF-2 #1 (Integrated DNA
technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA) and siITF-2 #2 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX). The level of
off-target effects was assessed by western blot analysis
using an anti-ITF-2 mAb in M14/AZD-3 and both ITF-2
siRNA’s significantly reduced ITF-2 expression levels
(Supplementary Figure 7). A non-targeting control siRNA
(negative control) and a cell death control siRNA (positive
control) were purchased from Qiagen. Cells were seeded
at 2 × 105 per well in a 6-well plate and were transfected
with 50 μM of siRNA using jetPRIME® in accordance
with the manufacturer’s instructions (Polyplus, Illkirch,
France). Cells were then incubated at 37°C for 24 h.

then incubated with secondary anti-goat antibody
conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Bethyl,
Montgomery, TX) and counterstained with a 4  μg/mL
DAPI solution. After the coverslips were mounted with
fluorescence mounting medium (Dako, Carpinteria,
CA), cells were viewed using a fluorescence microscope
(Olympus-IX71 Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

Flow cytometric apoptosis analysis
Cells (1 × 106) were treated with AZD6244 for
24 h, washed twice with cold PBS, and resuspended in
1× Binding Buffer at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL.
A 100 μL aliquot of this solution (1 × 105 cells) was then
transferred to a 5 mL culture tube to which 5 μL of FITC
Annexin V was added. These cells were incubated for
15 min at room temperature in the dark before assaying
with an Annexin V–FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit I
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), in accordance with the
manufacturer’s protocol. The percentage of apoptotic
cells was analyzed by flow cytometry within 1 h (Becton
Dickinson, San Jose, CA).

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (cell signaling
technology, Beverly, MA) and protein samples (50  μg)
were separated by SDS-PAGE and were blotted onto
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore,
Bedford,  MA). After blocking with 5% (w/v) non-fat
dry milk powder for 1 h, the membranes were incubated
with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C, then with
secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish
peroxidase (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY).
Specific antigen-antibody complexes were detected
by enhanced chemiluminescence using SuperSignal
West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA). Specific antibodies were as
follows: ITF-2 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), phospho-betacatenin (p-beta-catenin), beta-catenin, phospho-ERK
(p-ERK), ERK, phospho-GSK3 beta (Y216 and S9), GSK3 alpha and beta, phospho-90RSK (Y573), 90RSK, PARP,
cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly,
MA), dephospho-beta-catenin (de-p-beta-catenin) (Enzo
bioscience Inc. France), KRAS, B-RAF, phosphor-MEK,
MEK, and beta-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).
To isolate cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, cells
were incubated using NE-PER® Nuclear and cytoplasmic
extraction reagents (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For comparison,
one equivalent of cytoplasmic proteins and two equivalents
of nuclear proteins were analyzed side-by-side by western
blot analysis with different antibodies.

Assessment of cell death by Live-Dead cell
staining
Cell death after siRNA transfection with or without
AZD6244 treatment was assessed using Live-Dead Cell
Staining Kit (Enzo Life Sciences). This kit utilizes a cell
permeable green fluorescent dye to stain live cells. Dead
cells were stained by propidium iodide, a red fluorescent
dye, which is actively pumped out of the cytoplasm in
viable cells. Stained cells were visualized by fluorescence
microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

GST pull-down assay
pGEX-GSK3β (Addgene, Cambridge, MA) was
introduced into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by transformation and the
cells were cultured in 5 ml LB medium at 37°C to the
mid-log phase. Protein expression was induced by 1mM
isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG). After
culturing for 3 h, cells were pelleted by centrifugation and
then suspended in 100 μL of a lysis buffer (Cell Signaling
Technology, Beverly, MA). Recombinant GST-GSK3β
was purified using Glutathione- Sepharose 4B beads (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences. UK). Protein lysates of M14,
M14/AZD-3, and LOX-IMVI cell lines were respectively
combined with 50 μL pre-cleaned Glutathione- Sepharose
4B beads and the mixture was incubated under shaking
for 16 h at 4°C. The incubated beads were washed three
times with lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology,
Beverly, MA). After washing, 2× SDS-PAGE loading
buffer was added to the washed beads and proteins were
extracted from the beads by boiled for 5 min. Proteins

Immunofluorescence assay
Cells (2 × 105) grown on sterile glass coverslips
were transfected with either non-targeting control
siRNA or ITF-2 siRNA. These transfected cells were
then incubated with 1:50 anti-ITF-2 (Santa Cruz
Biothchnology, Dallas,  TX) at room temperature for
1 h after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde and
permeabilization with triton X-100. The cells were
