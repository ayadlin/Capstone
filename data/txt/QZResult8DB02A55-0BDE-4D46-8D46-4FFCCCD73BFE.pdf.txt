Abstract
Despite better control of early-stage disease and improved overall survival of patients with breast cancer, the
incidence of life-threatening brain metastases continues to increase in some of these patients. Unfortunately,
other than palliative treatments there is no effective therapy for this condition. In this study, we reveal a critical
role for Src activation in promoting brain metastasis in a preclinical model of breast cancer and we show how Srctargeting combinatorial regimens can treat HER2þ brain metastases in this model. We found that Src was
hyperactivated in brain-seeking breast cancer cells derived from human cell lines or from patients' brain
metastases. Mechanistically, Src activation promoted tumor cell extravasation into the brain parenchyma via
permeabilization of the blood–brain barrier. When combined with the EGFR/HER2 dual-targeting drug lapatinib,
an Src-targeting combinatorial regimen prevented outgrowth of disseminated breast cancer cells through the
induction of cell-cycle arrest. More importantly, this combinatorial regimen inhibited the outgrowth of
established experimental brain metastases, prolonging the survival of metastases-bearing mice. Our results
provide a rationale for clinical evaluation of Src-targeting regimens to treat patients with breast cancer suffering
from brain metastasis. Cancer Res; 73(18); 5764–74. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Although modern multimodality therapies have improved
the overall survival of patients with breast cancer, many of
these survivors ultimately develop brain metastases, with a
median survival of less than one year (1, 2). Neither chemotherapies nor targeted therapies are clinically effective in
treating life-threatening established brain metastases. Current
clinical options for patients with brain metastasis are very
limited. Most of these patients undergo whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) or stereotactic radiosurgery. As severe cognitive complications may accompany these aggressive treatments, particularly WBRT, the quality of life associated therewith is poor (3). Despite the better control of primary disease
and systemic metastases (4), the increasing incidence of brain

metastasis further underpins an imperative need for developing novel therapies to treat overt brain metastases and/or
prevent outgrowth of brain micrometastases.
Clinically, patients with either HER2-ampliﬁed (HER2þ) or
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have a signiﬁcantly higher
incidence of brain metastasis relapse (2, 5). Interestingly, the Src
family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (referred to as "Src",
hereafter) is critical for both types of breast cancer. In HER2þ
breast cancer, Src activation maximizes the HER2:HER3 interaction and serves as a convergent point of multiple upstream
signals, thus conferring resistance to anti-HER2 therapies (6–8).
TNBC cells are preferentially sensitive to Src-targeting smallmolecule inhibitors, indicating Src targeting is a promising
strategy for TNBC (9, 10). In addition, blood–brain barrier
(BBB)-permeable Src inhibitors have been considered for the
treatment of glioblastoma and leukemia in the central nervous
system (11, 12). This collective evidence suggests that targeting
Src, coupled with anti-HER family agents, is a promising strategy
for the treatment of breast cancer brain metastasis.
Here, we show a unique role of Src activation in disrupting
the BBB and promoting breast cancer brain metastasis. A
combinatorial regimen of Src and the EGFR/HER2 inhibitor
lapatinib-inhibited brain metastasis incidence and signiﬁcantly extended the overall survival of metastasis-bearing mice.
These data exemplify the clinical potential of Src-targeting
strategies for patients suffering from brain metastases.

Targeting Src for Brain Metastasis Therapies

Cancer Center (MDACC; Houston, TX) Cell Line Characterization Core Facility veriﬁed the identities of above cell lines.
MDA-MB-231.HER2 cells were generated as described previously (15). Lentiviral-based expression vector pLOVE and
packaging vectors were from Addgene. Src and ﬂuorescence
proteins vectors were generated via Gateway cloning. Lentiviral-based pLKO.1 Src short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was purchased from Sigma. All antibodies were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology.
Reverse phase protein array
Reverse phase protein array (RPPA) was conducted in
MDACC Functional Proteomics core facility. Brieﬂy, cellular
proteins were denatured by 1% SDS, serial diluted, and
spotted on nitrocellulose-coated slides. Each slide was
probed with a validated primary antibody plus a biotinconjugated secondary antibody. The signal obtained was
ampliﬁed using a DakoCytomation-catalyzed system and
visualized by 3,30 -diaminobenzidine (DAB) colorimetric
reaction. The slides were analyzed using customized Microvigene Software (VigeneTech Inc.). Each dilution curve was
ﬁtted with a logistic model ("super curve ﬁtting" developed
at MDACC) and normalized by median polish. Antibodies
that did not show progressive and consistent changes from
parental, Br.1 to Br.2 were excluded from further analysis.
The distance (Dis ¼ v1v2) between the normalized log
values of parental cell (control) and Br.2 were compared.
Antibodies with distance more than 0.1 were selected
for clustering. The data clustering was conducted using
Cluster 3.0 (centered by gene; followed by hierarchically
clustering by gene and array using complete linkage) and
TreeView.
Western blotting
Western blotting was done as previously described (16).
Brieﬂy, at the end of designated experiments, cells were lysed in
cell lysis buffer (20 mmol/L Tris at pH 7.0, 1% Triton-X 100, 0.5%
NP-40, 250 mmol/L NaCl, 3 mmol/L EDTA, and protease
inhibitor cocktail). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and
transferred onto a polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane. After
each membrane was blocked with 5% milk for 1 hour, it was
probed with various primary antibodies overnight at 4 C,
followed by incubation with secondary antibodies for 1 hour
at room temperature before being visualized with enhanced
chemiluminescence reagent.
Trans-BBB invasion assay
Human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC)
were purchased from Cell Systems. Immortalized mouse
astrocytes were a gift from Dr. Isaiah J. Fidler (MDACC).
HBMEC (5,000 cells) were plated on ﬁbronectin-coated
Transwell inserts with 8 mm pores. 24 hours later, astrocytes
(5,000 cells) were seeded on the bottom side of inserts.
Four days later, tumor cells were seeded in FBS-free
medium on top of the inserts and immersed into medium
containing 10% FBS for 24 hours. Fluorescent proteinlabeled cancer cells transmitting to bottom chambers were
counted.

Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing assay
Brieﬂy, 8W10E chamber slides were coated with type I
collagen and then plated with 100,000 mouse endothelial cells.
Eight hours later, tumor cells (500,000) were seeded onto the
endothelial cell monolayer. The transendothelial cell impedance was monitored in real-time by ECIS detector model 1600R
(Applied BioPhysics).
BBB permeability assays
BBB permeability was measured by ﬂuorescent tracers as
described before (17). Brieﬂy, BBB tracer dyes (1% sodium
ﬂuorescein in PBS, molecular weight 376 or 2% Evans blue in
PBS, molecular weight 960.82) were injected intravenously
on the same day as intracarotid injection of tumor cells.
Forty-eight hours later, whole mouse brains were dissected
and imaged using a ﬂuorescence stereomicroscope equipped
with ﬁlter sets for GFP and DsRed. The mean ﬂuorescence
intensity of dissected brains was compared by ImageJ software (NIH).
Cell proliferation, invasion, and adhesion assays
These assays were conducted as we have previously
described (8). Brieﬂy, cells (5,000/well) were seeded in 96-well
plates and treated for 72 hours. Cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay or Click-iT EdU Cell Proliferation Assays
(Life Technology). Percentage of inhibition of cell proliferation
was calculated as [1-(treated cells/untreated cells)  100]. For
invasion assays, a Transwell was coated with 15% Matrigel for 2
hours. Tumor cells (5,000/well) were plated in FBS-free medium. 10% FBS-containing medium was used as chemical attractant. For adhesion assay, a 96-well plate was coated with
ﬁbronectin for 1 hour at 37 C before blocking the plate with
0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in medium. About 100,000
cells were seeded and incubated for 30 minutes. After 2,000
rpm shaking for 1 minute, the cells that had adhered onto the
plate were stained with crystal violet and counted.
EdU cell-cycle assays
Cell-cycle analysis was conducted using Click-iT EdU Alexa
Fluor 647 Flow Cytometry Assay Kit from Life Technology.
Brieﬂy, EdU was added into cell-culture medium to a ﬁnal
concentration of 10 mmol/L 2 hours before the endpoint of the
experiments. Then, cells were washed once with 3 mL of 1%
BSA in PBS, ﬁxed using Click-iT ﬁxative, and incubated for 15
minutes in saponin-based permeabilization solution. Cells
were then treated with Click-iT reaction cocktail according
to manufacturer's instruction for 30 minutes before ﬂow
cytometry analysis.
Immunoﬂuorescence
Cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined by immunoﬂuorescence-based PathScan Apoptosis and Proliferation
Multiplex IF Kit from Cell Signaling. Brieﬂy, after washing with
PBS, cells were ﬁxed with 4% formaldehyde. Samples were
blocked with PBS per 5% normal goat serum for 1 hour before
incubation with a primary antibody cocktail overnight at 4 C.
Samples were then incubated with secondary antibodies
before examination using confocal microscope.

In vivo experiments
Animal experiments were conducted under approved MDACC
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocols. To
develop the brain metastasis models, female Swiss nude mice
were injected with tumor cells [250,000 cells in 0.1 mL Hank's
Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) for MDA-MB-231 and 500,000
cells in 0.1 ml HBSS for BT474.m1] into the right common
carotid artery. After development of overt metastases, whole
brains were dissected and disaggregated by using Tenbroeck
homogenizer brieﬂy in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium/F-12
medium before plating on tissue culture dishes. Two weeks later,
tumors cells recovered from brain tissue were collected and
expanded as brain-seeking sublines (Br.1). For drug treatment
assays, inhibitors were prepared in vehicle (0.5% hydroxypropyl–
methylcellulose with 0.1% Tween 80) and administered via oral
gavage (25 mg/kg/d saracatinib and 100 mg/kg/d lapatinib). At
the end of experiments, brains were excised for imaging and
histologic examination. Ten serial sagittal sections every 300
microns throughout the brain were analyzed as described (14).
Patient samples and immunohistochemistry
Tissues were collected under protocols approved by the
Institutional Review Board. Archived parafﬁn-embedded
tumor samples were coded with no patient identiﬁers and
subjected to standard immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis.
IHC staining was conducted as previously described (18).
Brieﬂy, after deparafﬁnization and rehydration, 4 mm sections
were subjected to heat-induced epitope retrieval (0.001 mol/L
EDTA for pSrc-Y416 and 0.01 mol/L citrate for cyclin D1). After
blocking with 1% goat serum and incubating with primary
antibody at 4 C overnight, slides underwent color development with DAB and hematoxylin counterstaining. Ten visual
ﬁelds from different areas of each tumor were evaluated by 2
independent pathologists. Cyclin D1 staining was calculated as
percentage of nuclear-positive cells per ﬁeld (%) and normalized by the total cancer cell number in each ﬁeld.
Statistical analysis
For quantitative data with normal distribution, the Student t
test was used for comparing 2 groups. Differences of IHC
staining were compared using c2 test. Survival analysis was
conducted using Kaplan–Meier model with two-sided log-rank
test. All P values are two-tailed. A difference with P < 0.05 (twosided) was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Development of novel brain metastasis cell line model
with endogenous HER2 ampliﬁcation
All currently available models for studying brain metastasis
have severe limitations (19). Among other limitations, none of
the current models are representative of breast cancers with
endogenous HER2 ampliﬁcation (HER2þ). Therefore, to model
HER2þ breast cancer brain metastasis, we used a subline of
the HER2þ tumorigenic BT474 human breast cancer cell line,
BT474.m1 (BT474), to select for brain-seeking (Br) cells in vivo.
Tumor cells were injected into the right-side common carotid
artery (Fig. 1A, left). Three months later, BT474 cells formed
overt brain metastases predominantly in the right hemisphere of

5766

Cancer Res; 73(18) September 15, 2013

the brain. Rare micrometastasis in left hemisphere could be
detected. No metastasis was observed in other organs. Overt
brain metastasis lesions derived from BT474 cells have a moderately invasive phenotype (Fig. 1A, right, hematoxylin and eosin
stain, H&E) with a high-level of HER2 expression (Fig. 1A, right,
IHC HER2), although metastatic formation occurs with low
efﬁciency. The metastatic lesions were isolated and used for
additional cycles of in vivo selection of Br.2 and Br.3 sublines.
Src signaling is upregulated in brain-seeking cell lines
and human brain metastases
To reveal the mechanisms contributing to brain metastasis,
we conducted RPPA analyses comparing BT474.Br sublines
with the parental line (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Table S1).
In vivo selective pressure led to an increase of Src protein
expression in the brain-seeking subline BT474.Br.2 (Fig. 1B and
C, left). This upregulation was accompanied by a strong
increase in Src activity, indicated by increased phosphorylation
of Src on tyrosine 416 (pSrc-Y416; Fig. 1C, left). pSrc-Y416 and
phospho-Paxillin (Y118; a Src downstream target) were also
signiﬁcantly elevated in the Br subline of MDA-MB-231 (Fig.
1C, right). A consistent change of Akt phosphorylation could
not be detected. To validate the clinical relevance, we compared pSrc-Y416 levels between resected brain metastases and
primary breast tumors (unmatched) by IHC analyses (Fig. 1D).
Forty-ﬁve primary breast tumors and 46 unmatched brain
metastasis tumors were collected. Of all the primary tumors,
31.1% were HER2þ and 51.1% were estrogen receptor-positive
(ERþ). Of brain metastases, 43.3% were HER2þ and 33.3% were
ERþ. Src activation, indicated by strong membrane staining of
pSrc-Y416 staining, was signiﬁcantly increased in brain metastases compared with primary breast tumors (65.7% vs. 34.3%
IHC 3þ; c2 P ¼ 0.008). Moreover, a signiﬁcant increase of pSrc416 (c2, P ¼ 0.045) was observed in HER2-ampliﬁed tumors
(Supplementary Table S2).
Src activation in tumor cells promotes the invasion of
simulated BBB in vitro and brain metastasis in vivo
To determine the functional role of Src activation in brain
metastasis, we expressed either V5-tagged wild-type Src (SrcWT) or constitutively activated Src (Src-Y527F) in MDA-MB231 and BT474 parental cells. Src activation was validated by
Western blotting (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S1A). Next,
we examined key brain metastasis-related properties in vitro in
Src-activated cells. One distinct feature of the brain is the
presence of the BBB, which represents the ﬁrst line of defense
in preventing extravasation of disseminated tumors cells into
the brain (20, 21). To test role of Src activation in cell extravasation, we used an in vitro model of BBB by coculturing brain
endothelial cells and astrocytes on each side of the membrane
of a Transwell (Fig. 2B, left; ref. 22). Src-Y527F 231.Br cells were
signiﬁcantly (2.5-fold) more efﬁcient in passing through the
simulated BBB (P ¼ 0.002; Fig. 2B, right). Similarly, transfection
of either Src-WT or Src-Y527F into BT474 parental cells
signiﬁcantly promoted invasion (2.0-fold and 2.2-fold increase,
respectively; Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1C). Next, we
knocked down Src in brain-seeking sublines using 2 independent Src shRNA constructs (Src.sh648 and Src.sh.1579). Stable

Targeting Src for Brain Metastasis Therapies

tumor cells occasionally generated extracranial lesions. Interestingly, the extracranial tumors observed had a similar ratio of
parental (GFP-labeled) and Src-activated (TdRed-labeled) cells
(Fig. 2D), in sharp contrast with a dominant brain metastatic
tumor formation by the Src-activated cells. We also carried out
the same experiment by injecting tdTomato red-labeled MDAMB-231 cells that stably overexpress wild-type Src and control
cells labeled with GFP (vec.GFP). Consistently, overt brain
metastases contained signiﬁcantly more Src-overexpressing
cells than vector control cells (P ¼ 0.0051; Supplementary
Fig. S2). These in vivo observations pointed to a unique role
of Src activation in the development of brain metastasis.

transfection of Src shRNAs led to downregulation of Src,
dramatic inhibition of Src activation (Fig. 2C, left) and significant suppression of invasion of the simulated BBB in both
MDA-MB-231.Br (3.14-fold) and BT474.Br (4.74-fold) models
(Fig. 2C, right). In vivo brain metastasis assays further tested
the role of Src activation in promoting brain metastasis. We
injected an equal mixture (1:1 ratio) of Src-activated MDA-MB231 cells labeled with tdTomato Red (Src-527F.TdRed) and
control cells labeled with GFP (vec.GFP). Remarkably, 35 days
after injection, mice developed overt brain metastases dominated by strong red ﬂuorescent signals (Src-Y527F cells; Fig.
2D, left). As a byproduct of the model, intracarotid injection of

Targeting Src for Brain Metastasis Therapies

monotherapy in treating brain metastases in limited clinical
studies (23, 24). We reasoned that a combination of the smallmolecule Src inhibitor saracatinib plus lapatinib might be a
superior regimen for HER2þ brain metastases therapy. To
support this hypothesis, we ﬁrst showed that saracatinib
abolished cell migration in a wound-healing assay (Supplementary Fig. S3) and signiﬁcantly enhanced the inhibitory
effects of lapatinib on trans-BBB invasion and the adhesion
of 231.Br cells transfected with HER2 to the extracellular
matrix (Fig. 4A). Similarly, saracatinib and lapatinib treatment
each inhibited the invasion of BT474.Br cells (60% and 75%
inhibition, respectively) and combinatorial treatment further
enhanced the inhibitory effect to about 90% (Supplementary
Fig. S4). Moreover, compared with either single-drug treatment, the combinatorial treatment more effectively inhibited
proliferation of BT474.Br and 231.Br cells (Fig. 4B). Together,
the data indicated that Src-targeting combinatorial treatments
can more effectively inhibit both metastasis-related properties
and proliferation of brain-seeking cancer cells.
Next, we investigated this combinatorial regimen for both
prevention and treatment of breast cancer brain metastasis

junctions (Fig. 3A). In addition, compared with 231.Vec cells,
injection of 231.Src-Y527F cells into mice resulted in a much
greater compromise of BBB integrity in vivo, as measured by
the accumulation of 2 BBB integrity tracers in the brain
parenchyma (Fig. 3B and C). Compared with vector control
cells, Src-activated cells induced a 2-fold increase of accumulation of both small molecular weight BBB tracer (sodium
ﬂuorescein) and high molecular weight tracer (Evans blue) in
the brain parenchyma (Fig. 3C). Concordantly, 5 days after
intracarotid injection, signiﬁcantly (P ¼ 0.0132) more Srcactivated cells had extravasated successfully into the brain
parenchyma than the 231.Vec control cells, likely due to a leaky
BBB (Fig. 3D).
Src-targeting combinatorial treatments inhibit
experimental brain metastasis
We next sought to preclinically test the efﬁcacy of targeting
Src for brain metastasis treatment. Although once considered a
promising targeted therapy for HER2þ breast cancer brain
metastases, lapatinib, an EGFR and HER2 dual-targeting smallmolecule inhibitor, showed only a modest efﬁcacy (6%) as a

suppression of pSrc-Y416 in brain metastasis lesions derived
from 231.Br.HER2 cells in mice, indicating the BBB permeability of saracatinib (Supplementary Fig. S5). We then tested
saracatinib for prevention of brain metastasis with treatment
started at day 0 after intracarotid injection, before tumor cell
extravasation (Fig. 4C). Saracatinib decreased the overall incidence of brain metastasis (4 of 10 mice had brain metastases)
compared with vehicle-treated group (9 of 10 mice), which is
likely due to reduced tumor cell extravasation due to Src
inhibition. Histologic examination 30 days after tumor cell
injection revealed that the combinatorial regimen of lapatinib
and saracatinib exhibited signiﬁcantly (P ¼ 0.036, Student t
test) better efﬁcacy in reducing overt brain metastases, The
combinatorial treatment effectively reduced the large brain
metastases derived from 231.Br.HER2 cells (Fig. 4C, left). We
next tested the efﬁcacy of the combinatorial regimen in
treatment of established metastases. Combinatorial treatment
signiﬁcantly (P ¼ 0.004, log-rank test) extended overall survival
of brain metastases-bearing mice (Fig. 4D, left, 231.Br.HER2

lapatinib or saracatinib alone had only modest effects on
prolonging the survival of brain metastases-bearing mice,
whereas combinatorial treatment signiﬁcantly extended the
survival time of these mice (median survival of 43 days in
vehicle control group vs. 103 days in combinatorial treatment
group, P ¼ 0.0177; Fig. 4D, right). Collectively, these data
strongly support the potential clinical application of this

kinases (RTK), including HER2, HER3, and Eph family receptors (Fig. 5A). In addition, phosphorylation of both Akt and Erk
was also inhibited (Fig. 5A). Western blotting validated that
cotreatment with lapatinib and saracatinib more signiﬁcantly
inhibited HER2 and Akt phosphorylation than either individual
treatment (Fig. 5B). Saracatinib treatment of BT474.Br cells
further inhibited cell proliferation and promoted lapatinibinduced PARP cleavage. The phosphorylation of histone H3
serine 10 (a proliferation marker) in BT474.Br cells was greatly
diminished in combination treatment group compared with
the control group (Fig. 5C). Concurrently, cleaved PARP, an
apoptosis marker, was detected in combinatorial therapytreated BT474.Br cells but not in control- or single drug-treated
cells (Fig. 5A, and data not shown). Consistently, a sub-G1

of BT474.Br cells resulted in more than 60% apoptotic cells
compared with less than 40% apoptosis by lapatinib single

Combinatorial treatment suppresses cell-cycle
progression
A recent study has suggested that inhibition of Src disrupts pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2)-dependent b-catenin
transactivation of cyclin D1 (25). To investigate whether
this mechanism may also contribute to the inhibition of
proliferation of BT474.Br and 231.Br cells, we further analyzed the cell-cycle proﬁle after combinatorial treatment.

Discussion

using 231.Br model revealed that inhibition of Src and HER2
signaling by combinatorial therapy led to a decrease of EdU
incorporation (Fig. 6A, top), an indicator of reduced DNA
synthesis. Correspondingly, signiﬁcantly more cells were
arrested at G1 phase (Fig. 6A, bottom). Furthermore, while
neither saracatinib nor lapatinib single treatment could
signiﬁcantly reduce cyclin D1 expression in either BT474.
Br or 231.Br.HER2 cells, combinatorial therapy led to a
prominent decrease of cyclin D1 protein expression in both
cell lines (Fig. 6B and C and Supplementary Fig. S6). In
BT474.Br cells, combined treatment also led to a strong
induction of p27 protein expression (Fig. 6B). Thus, Srctargeting combinatorial treatment further enhanced the
therapeutic effects on cell-cycle regulatory proteins. In
accordance with these data, IHC staining of brain metastasis
tumors from mice injected with 231.Br.HER2 cells also
showed that combinatorial therapy led to fewer tumor
lesions with a signiﬁcant decrease of cyclin D1-positive cells
compared with single treatments (Fig. 6D).

To develop novel therapies for brain metastases, it is imperative to understand the mechanism of the disease. Brain
metastasis is a complex and inefﬁcient process. As such,
in vivo models that simulate the development of brain metastasis are limited (19, 26). None of the currently brain metastasis
models adequately represent breast cancers with endogenous
HER2 ampliﬁcation. Intracranial injection of HER2þ tumor
cells directly into brain parenchyma (27) bypassed the most
critical obstacle of brain metastasis, the BBB, failing to faithfully model the brain metastasis. Previously, in lieu of endogenously HER2þ models, the 231.Br model was transfected with
HER2 for use in brain metastasis preclinical study (14). However, this model's problems include the facts that HER2 is
exogenously overexpressed and HER3, which is crucial for
HER2 signaling, is not expressed at all (14, 15). BT474 cells
have endogenous HER2 ampliﬁcation and here, we show that
they readily form moderately invasive brain metastatic tumors.
Histologically, BT474 brain metastasis tumors have a distinct

Targeting Src for Brain Metastasis Therapies

metastasis pattern from that of the MDA-MB-231 model (Fig.
1A). Importantly, the BT474 model might more faithfully
represents the therapeutic response of HER2þ tumor to
anti-HER2 therapies, which makes it an ideal model for testing
HER2-targeting combinatorial therapies for HER2þ tumor
brain metastasis.
Our studies shed new light on the potential clinical application of Src inhibitor-containing regimens in the treatment of
HER2þ breast cancer brain metastasis. While Src inhibitor
holds promise in treating metastatic disease, Src inhibitor
monotherapy clinical trials were unsuccessful (28). Previous
Src inhibitor trials were conducted in unselected patients,
which may be one underlying reason for the overall low
response rate observed. To improve the clinical beneﬁt of
Src-targeting therapies, it will be important to preselect
patients whose tumors have Src activation before applying
Src inhibitors. Indeed, a number of preclinical studies showed a
strong correlation between Src pathway activation with the
response to Src inhibitors and the importance of hyperactivated Src signaling for the ideal therapeutic efﬁcacy of Src
inhibitors (29, 30). In breast cancer cells, the expression of Yesassociated protein-1 (YAP1), Src pathway-associated protein,
strongly correlated with a response to the Src inhibitor dasatinib (10). Consistently, our RPPA analysis of brain-seeking
breast cancer sublines revealed Src activation along with a
prominent increase of YAP phosphorylation at S127, an indicator of YAP activation (Fig. 1B). Collectively, these data
indicate a super activation of Src pathway in brain metastases
and provide the rationale to target Src activation for treating
brain metastasis. Preselection of patient groups using Src
activation biomarker may improve the clinical efﬁcacy of
Src-targeting therapies, especially for patients with brain
metastasis.
Src is a key downstream transducer of many RTKs, especially
EGFR and HER2 (8, 31). The crosstalk between Src signaling
and RTKs facilitates RTK-addicted tumor growth (32). For
HER2þ tumors, we and others recently showed that targeting
Src signaling signiﬁcantly sensitized resistant tumors to antiHER2 therapies (7, 6). In this study, we also showed that Src
inhibitor plus lapatinib extended the overall survival of mice
bearing HER2þ brain metastasis tumors. As clinical studies
have indicated that lapatinib has only moderate therapeutic
efﬁcacy for brain metastasis (14, 23), it is conceivable that
combining Src inhibitors with lapatinib should enhance the
efﬁcacy in treating brain metastasis, especially for HER2þ
breast cancer brain metastasis. Notably, we also observed
additive effects of this combinatorial regimen in inhibiting
brain metastasis of the triple-negative MDA-MB-231.Br cells
(Fig. 4B). This suggested that the combinatorial therapy might
also be efﬁcacious for treatment of brain metastasis derived
from TNBC. In addition, our data on Src promoting the

extravasion of disseminated tumor cells, an early step in the
metastatic cascade, emphasized the importance of choosing
the right therapeutic window. To obtain the optimum efﬁcacy
in treating and preventing brain metastasis, clinical testing of
Src-targeting combinatorial therapies in the after adjuvant
treatment setting is warranted (33). Applying rationally
designed combinatorial therapies in adjuvant setting may not
only reduce the risk of metastatic recurrence, but also prevent
the outgrowth of secondary metastases.
In summary, our studies functionally and mechanistically
deﬁne an important role of Src activation in promoting breast
cancer brain metastasis. The high efﬁcacy of the combinatorial
regimen of lapatinib plus saracatinib for prevention and treatment of HER2þ experimental brain metastases may complement the limited existing clinical options for patients with
brain metastasis.
