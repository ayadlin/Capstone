ABSTRACT
Over half of BRAFV600E melanomas display intrinsic resistance to BRAF
inhibitors, in part due to adaptive signaling responses. In this communication we ask
whether BRAFV600E melanomas share common adaptive responses to BRAF inhibition
that can provide clinically relevant targets for drug combinations. We screened a
panel of 12 treatment-naïve BRAFV600E melanoma cell lines with MAP Kinase
pathway inhibitors in pairwise combination with 58 signaling inhibitors, assaying for
synergistic cytotoxicity. We found enormous diversity in the drug combinations that
showed synergy, with no two cell lines having an identical profile. Although the 6 lines
most resistant to BRAF inhibition showed synergistic benefit from combination with
lapatinib, the signaling mechanisms by which this combination generated synergistic
cytotoxicity differed between the cell lines. We conclude that adaptive responses to
inhibition of the primary oncogenic driver (BRAFV600E) are determined not only by
the primary oncogenic driver but also by diverse secondary genetic and epigenetic
changes (“back-seat drivers”) and hence optimal drug combinations will be variable.
Because upregulation of receptor tyrosine kinases is a major source of drug resistance
arising from diverse adaptive responses, we propose that inhibitors of these receptors
may have substantial clinical utility in combination with inhibitors of the MAP Kinase
pathway.

cases where responses appear to be robust, many tumors
are intrinsically resistant to treatment because of their
ability to rapidly adapt to target inhibition. Even though
combining a MEK inhibitor such as trametinib along with
a BRAF inhibitor can improve the response, only half of
patients show a “complete” response and the majority of
patients show disease progression after one year [4–8].
Analysis of samples from patients with recurrent disease
has provided considerable insight into the mechanisms by
which BRAF mutant melanomas ultimately achieve resistance
to BRAF inhibitors [6, 8–20]. These almost always involve
reactivation of the MAP Kinase pathway, although PI3Kinase,
STATs, HIPPO, beta-catenin, BH3 proteins, autophagy and

INTRODUCTION
BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib and dabra­
fenib have generated remarkable responses in the
approximately 50% of melanomas containing activating
mutations in BRAF [See reference [1] for a comprehensive
review]. However, only 50–60% of patients demonstrate
therapeutic responses to BRAF inhibitors by RECIST
criteria, and only 10% demonstrate a complete response.
Moreover, the responses generally are not durable, with
aggressive disease typically recurring within 6 months
[2]. When disease recurs it often appears at the same
sites as the original tumors [3], indicating that even in

translational regulation have also been flagged [21–40].
Tumors that have been selected for resistance can be expected
to display diverse resistance mechanisms, since anything that
promotes cell growth can provide a selective advantage for the
tumor. Indeed, multiple resistance mechanisms appear even
between different metastases or different regions within the
same tumor [16, 20, 41–43].
Less is known about the rapid homeostatic adaptations
that occur within the first few hours or days following the
initiation of treatment and that allow the cancer cells to
survive initial inhibition of BRAF. A number of investigators
[18, 44–47] have called attention to these homeostatic
adaptations as an important component of intrinsic resistance
or early relapse, and pointed out how they can set the stage
for selection of genetic and epigenetic variants in which
the MAP Kinase pathway is reactivated. Thus, there is
a need to identify and analyze the adaptations that can be
deployed rapidly by cancer cells and that enable survival
and the resumption of proliferation in spite of inhibition of
mutant BRAF. It seems likely that identification and analysis
of mechanisms of adaptive resistance to BRAF inhibition
could guide the development of additional combination
therapies that would provide more complete responses, and
by anticipating mechanisms of acquired resistance, would
lead to more durable responses as well.
Analysis of transcriptional and proteomic changes
following blockade of MAP Kinase signaling has revealed
a stunning complexity in adaptive responses [8, 20, 41,
45–61] and it has been difficult to determine which of the
numerous components of the “adaptome” would be most
appropriate for therapeutic co-targeting. Therefore, we
[61, 62] as well as Held et al. [56] have taken an empirical,
chemical genetic approach to identify actionable adaptive
responses. Both groups performed chemical genetic
screens with diverse drug combinations to probe the
melanoma cell signaling network for novel functional
interactions and identify drug combinations effective
on either mutant RAF, RAS or wild-type melanomas.
Surprisingly, no single drug combination or subset of
drug combinations was found to be synergistic in either
all of the RAF or all of the RAS mutant melanoma lines.
This suggested that the underlying signaling network of
each melanoma line was different, even when the primary
driver (RAF or RAS) was the same.
In the current communication we focused on
identifying drug combinations that might be clinically
useful and mechanistically informative. We conducted a
targeted combinatorial chemical genetic screen using as
primary drugs either the vemurafenib analog PLX4720 or
two other inhibitors of the MAP Kinase pathway in twoway combinations with 58 drugs or clinically relevant
tool compounds in 12 BRAFV600E melanoma cell lines.
We found that half the lines showed synergistic benefit
by combining lapatinib or masitinib with PLX4720.
Importantly, the lines that showed benefit from this
combination were the lines least sensitive intrinsically to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

BRAF inhibition, indicating the importance of Receptor
Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) signaling in vemurafenib resistance,
as shown previously [13, 56, 63–75]. Nevertheless, the
overall pattern of effective drug combinations was different
for each cell line, indicating that the “wiring” of the
signaling network and mechanisms of adaptive resistance
differed for each line even though all were driven by
BRAFV600E and 6 of the 12 showed enhanced cytotoxicity
from an RTK inhibitor. Protein pathway phosphorylation/
activation mapping via reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA)
and gene expression analysis confirmed that, even when
cells were sensitive to the combination of PLX4720 and
lapatinib, the adaptive changes in intracellular signaling in
response to BRAF inhibition differed and the mechanism(s)
by which lapatinib or masitinib were synergistically
cytotoxic differed. We propose that intrinsic and adaptive
resistance to BRAF inhibition in BRAFV600E melanomas
occurs by multiple mechanisms that differ substantially,
dependent on the broader genetic and epigenetic landscape
of the cancer cells that shape the underlying architecture
of cell signaling networks. Because Receptor Tyrosine
Kinases (RTKs) can activate multiple resistance pathways,
and upregulation of RTKs is a convergent source of drug
resistance in many cell lines, inhibitors of these receptors
can play an important role in drug combinations in a variety
of genetic backgrounds and may be clinically useful in
combinations with inhibitors of the MAP Kinase pathway.

RESULTS
Combinatorial drug screening reveals diverse
patterns of cytotoxic synergy between MAP
Kinase pathway inhibitors and other targeted
agents
We assembled a library of 58 small molecule cell
signaling inhibitors, focused on targeted drugs or related
tool compounds, and containing not only kinase inhibitors,
but also inhibitors of various other enzymatic processes
(Supplementary Table S1). These were tested for synergistic
cytotoxicity in 12 treatment-naïve BRAFV600E cell lines in
combination with one of three inhibitors of the MAP Kinase
pathway: PLX4720, a vemurafenib analog and inhibitor of
activated RAF; RAF265, a less-specific RAF inhibitor; or
PD325901, a selective allosteric MEK inhibitor (Figure 1).
We scored for synergy for two reasons. First, synergy is
considered a marker of functional interactions between the
targets, thus suggesting that the benefit of drug combination
was due to inhibition of an adaptive response. Second, there
is a possibility that the synergy would be maintained in vivo,
thus enabling a broader therapeutic window. We scored
synergy using the Bliss model of independence [76, 77] in
part because it quantifies interactions even where one drug
does not display cytotoxic effects as a single agent, a common
occurrence with targeted therapies.

Figure 1 Panel A demonstrates the range of varia­
bility of intrinsic sensitivity in our cell line panel to
PLX4720 as a single agent: from VMM12 and A375
which are highly sensitive, to DM331 which is almost
entirely resistant in vitro. Panel B displays the degrees of
synergistic or antagonistic interactions between the drug
pairs, and identifies the 26% synergy (98th percentile)
cut-off that was used to generate Panel C, where the
synergistic drug pairs are displayed. Note that each of the
three MAP Kinase pathway inhibitors is synergistic with
a distinct pattern of combination drugs, demonstrating
that the specificity of the primary drug (e.g. PLX4720 vs

RAF265) and the identity of its target (RAF vs MEK)
play a role in establishing the optimum combination of
drugs. This is displayed in Panel D, which shows that
two of the secondary drugs demonstrated synergy only
with PLX4720, and nine showed synergy with PLX4720
and RAF265 but not with the MEK inhibitor. No drugs
were synergistic only with the MEK inhibitor, consistent
with the notion that effectiveness of the RAF inhibitors
depends at least in part on their inhibition of MEK
activity. Also note that the frequency of synergistic “hits”
was inversely proportional to the selectivity of the pri­
mary drug, indicating the potential utility of multi-target

performed by combining 58 secondary drugs with varying concentrations of the vemurafenib-analog, PLX4720, pan-RAF inhibitor, RAF265,

percent synergy assessed by the Bliss independence method [76]. Cytotoxicity was normalized to the vehicle control treated samples for each
cell line. Each data point on the curve represents the difference between the observed cytotoxicity and the predicted additive cytotoxicity
based on the Bliss model (termed “percent synergy”). A cutoff was drawn at p-value of 0.05 which corresponds to the 98th percentile and 26%
synergy. C. Drug combinations that produced cytotoxicity greater than 26% over Bliss predicted were identified and color coded according to
the primary drug (PLX4720 [blue bars], RAF265 [yellow bars] or PD325901 [red bars]). Combinations that did not display synergy in any line
are not shown. D. Venn diagram shows overlap of synergistic cytotoxicity of secondary drug with Raf and MEK inhibitors.

agents even in drug combinations. Importantly, no two
cell lines showed the same pattern of sensitivity to drug
combinations. This further confirms previous suggestions
[56, 62] that the genetic landscape of each individual cell
line is determinative for the ability of a drug combination’s
effectiveness, regardless of the cell lineage and primary
driver, in this case BRAFV600E melanoma.
Within this complexity, there is a striking
concordance: half of the cell lines showed synergy
between PLX4720 and lapatinib or masitinib (Figure 1C),
suggesting an important role for Receptor Tyrosine Kinase
activity in intrinsic resistance to BRAFV600E inhibition,
consistent with previous findings from others [13, 54,
56, 63, 64, 66–74, 78–85]. The data in Figure 2A–2F
demonstrate that the synergistic interactions between

lapatinib and PLX4720 are displayed over a wide range
of concentrations, and that the combination can generate
almost complete cytotoxicity in resistant cell lines at
concentrations of individual drugs that have incomplete
effects as single agents. By contrast, the PLX4720
sensitive line A375 showed little benefit and no significant
synergistic effect from the addition of lapatinib, even
though the experiments utilized at least one dose below the
IC50. The effectiveness of lapatinib was not consistently
correlated with the expression level of the EGFR or other
members of the HER family of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases
(Supplementary Figure S1), although DM331, the most
resistant line, expressed the highest levels of EGFR and
we have shown that it expresses neuregulin, and is the only
line in this panel to do so [61]. Figure 2G demonstrates

that the response to the PLX4720-lapatinib combination
is bimodal with respect to synergy. Importantly, the lines
that showed the greatest intrinsic resistance to PLX4720
as a single agent displayed synergistic benefit from the
addition of lapatinib (Compare Figure 2G to Figure 1B).
By contrast, the lines most sensitive to PLX4720 did not
display synergistic cytotoxicity from lapatinib addition
even when PLX4720 was used at concentrations that
caused only modest (less than 50%) growth inhibition.

do not know whether this is due to reprogramming of the
melanoma signaling networks in vivo, an effect on the tumor
microenvironment or pharmacokinetic issues. Addition of
lapatinib provided strong therapeutic benefit (Figure 3).
Qualitatively similar results were obtained with SKMEL24
xenografts, showing improved tumor control with the drug
combinations. The mice tolerated the combination well with
all mice maintaining weight throughout the experiment (data
not shown).

BRAF inhibition triggers diverse adaptive
responses in cell signaling

To determine whether synergy observed in vitro could
be seen in vivo, PLX4720-resistant DM331 cells and partially
resistant SKMEL24 cells were implanted subcutaneously in
immunodeficient mice, PLX4720 was administered with or
without lapatinib, and tumor growth was monitored. DM331
tumors were partially sensitive to PLX4720 in vivo even
though they were almost entirely resistant in cell culture. We

Because resistance to BRAF inhibitors in melanoma
patients is almost always due to reactivation of the MAP
Kinase pathway [6, 11, 13, 15, 18, 20, 44, 60, 70, 84,
86–96] we expected that lapatinib would reinforce the
effectiveness of PLX4720 on MAP Kinase pathway
inhibition. However, western blots of phospho-ERK did
not confirm this expectation (Figure 4): during the 72 hour

period where growth inhibition was measured, comparable
inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by PLX4720 was
observed in sensitive and resistant lines at concentrations
of PLX4720 where synergy was apparent, and lapatinib
addition had little effect on this (although a modest effect
on rebound of ERK phosphorylation in DM331 was
observed in some experiments).
We employed RPPA to map the basal activation
state and adaptive responses to BRAF inhibition on a
broader range of signaling pathway proteins in our panel
of 12 BRAFV600E melanomas as well as 4 BRAFwt
melanomas (Figure 5 and Supplementary Figures 2, 3 and
5). In the basal state, phosphosites representative of the
MAPK, PI3K JNK or STAT pathways did not correlate
uniformly with sensitivity to PLX4720 or responsiveness
to lapatinib. However, there was a trend for higher
expression of pAKT and some of its substrates in the 8
lines most resistant to PLX4720, compared to 3 of the 4
most sensitive lines (Supplementary Figure S2). Similarly,
by comparing protein and phosphoprotein levels from
RPPA data between the three most resistant (VMM5A,

VMM18 and DM331) and three most sensitive (VMM12,
A375 and VMM15) cell lines to PLX4720 treatment using
a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, we identified significantly
higher levels of pAKT and pAKT substrates in the basal
state of the resistant lines (data not shown). However,
these trends in basal phosphorylation did not correlate
with sensitivity to the combination of PLX4720 with
either PI3K or PDK1 inhibitors (Figures 1 and 7).
We then performed RPPA analysis to determine
whether there was congruence in adaptive responses to
BRAF inhibition. Cultures of the 12 BRAFV600E and
4 BRAFwt cell lines were treated with PLX4720 for 8
hours, a time chosen based on work showing that feedback
responses to MAP Kinase pathway inhibition become
evident at 6–8 hours [44, 97]. The data (Figure 5) show
that BRAFV600E inhibition causes inhibition of many
protein phosphorylations in addition to those that are
considered part of the MAP Kinase pathway. Conversely,
in the BRAFwt melanoma lines, MAP Kinase pathway
phosphorylations are “paradoxically” upregulated as
expected [98] but also many other phosphorylations are

described and analyzed by Reverse Phase Protein Arrays. Differentially abundant or differentially phosphorylated epitopes were identified
using a moderated t-test, and epitopes with an FDR of better than 1% are marked with an asterisk (“*”). Unsupervised hierarchical

upregulated, presumably reflecting the adaptive changes
for these genotypes. Besides this broad dichotomy, the
diversity of adaptive responses within the BRAFV600E
melanomas is striking. Notably, the degree of inhibition of
MAP Kinase pathway components was not related to drug
sensitivity, and upregulation of PI3 Kinase-related epitopes
occurred in only a few instances. Unsupervised cluster
analysis of the changes in protein phosphorylation induced
by treatment with PLX4720 as a single agent within the
panel of 114 phospho-sites revealed that the adaptive
responses (“kinome rewiring” [46]) differed substantially
between the cell lines mirroring the diversity of synergistic
drug responses shown in Figure 1C, and no consistent
signature of adaptive responses could be extracted.
To determine whether lapatinib would consistently
have a predominant effect on a subset of these adaptive
responses, we treated cells with PLX4720, lapatinib
or the combination for 1, 8 or 24 hours and analyzed
the responses by RPPA (Supplementary Figure S3).
We included PLX4720-sensitive A375 cells, and three
lines that covered the span of resistance: SKMEL24,
VMM5A and DM331, as well as two RAS-transformed
lines, SKMEL2 and VMM39. The data demonstrate a
wide diversity of responses between the cell lines to
the combination of PLX4720 and lapatinib, regardless
of whether the primary driving oncogene was BRAF or
NRAS.
The variety of adaptive responses can easily be
visualized by focusing on a panel of MAP Kinase and PI3
Kinase pathway phosphorylation sites within the RPPA
array (Figure 6). Figure 6A shows the inhibition of the
MAP Kinase pathway by PLX4720 as a single agent in the
BRAFV600E melanomas and their activation in the NRAS
melanomas, based on the data displayed in Supplementary
Figure S3. Blockade of BRAF in the BRAFV600E
melanoma lines resulted in a drop in activating
phosphorylations throughout the MAP Kinase pathway,
including the transcription factor ELK1 and downstream
kinases p90RSK and MSK1. Thus, pathway blockade
in BRAFV600E melanomas was effective regardless
of whether growth was inhibited. Lapatinib addition to
PLX4720 did not significantly alter these phosphorylation
changes, regardless of whether synergistic cytotoxicity was
occurring (Supplementary Figure S3). Although PLX4720
as a single agent did not cause aggregate changes in
PI3 Kinase pathway phosphorylations (Figure 6A),
examination of the individual sites of phosphorylation
(Figure 6B) revealed changes potentially informative of
the mechanism of synergy with lapatinib in SKMEL24,
but not in VMM5A. In the case of SKMEL24 (red
bars), addition of lapatinib reversed the activating effect
PLX4720 had on AKT phosphorylation, and deepened the
inhibitory effects on the other phosphorylations, consistent
with the hypothesis that lapatinib is synergistic in these
cells by inhibiting PI3 Kinase signaling. By contrast,
in VMM5A cells, addition of lapatinib to PLX4720 did
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

not significantly alter any of the PI3 Kinase pathway
phosphorylations beyond their response to PLX4720
alone, suggesting that the RTK inhibitor generated synergy
by inhibiting a pathway other than MAP Kinase or PI3
Kinase in these cells. This is consistent with the empirical
data of Figure 1, showing that the PI3 Kinase inhibitor
PI103 had no synergistic benefit when combined with
PLX4720 in these VMM5A cells.
Inspection of Figure 1 Panel C reveals that the
putative PDK inhibitor, OSU-03012, provided the same
pattern of synergies as the RTK inhibitors lapatinib and
masitinib. This suggests that inhibition of this enzyme,
a component of the PI3 Kinase signaling pathway, could
be a key element in the adaptive resistance to PLX4720
in these cells. To test this concept, we examined the
effects of GSK2334470, another PDK1 inhibitor with a
different chemical structure. We found that GSK2334470
also displayed synergistic cytotoxicity with PLX4720
in SKMEL24 but to a lesser extent and over a narrow
concentration range in VMM5A (Figure 7) consistent
with the RPPA data which indicated that the PI3 Kinase
pathway was not a major component of adaptive resistance
in VMM5A. (We suspect that the broader effectiveness of
OSU-03012 is due to a lack of specificity). These findings
support the proposal that in at least some melanomas that
utilize PI3 Kinase signaling as a survival mechanism,
PDK1 can be an important component, as suggested by
Ronai and colleagues [35, 99].
To further broaden our analysis of drug-induced
adaptive changes in cell signaling we profiled the
transcriptional responses in five lines to treatment for
8 hours with PLX4720, lapatinib, masitinib or the
combinations using Illumina HT12 v4 arrays (Figure 8).
Inspection of the heat map of transcriptional changes
shows broadly different responses to treatment with
PLX4720 alone. A375 had a robust transcriptional
response, which is expected given its strong sensitivity to
the drug. The slightly resistant and non-synergistic line
HT144 and the highly resistant line DM331 showed very
modest transcriptional responses. However, SKMEL24
and SKMEL28, both of which are partially resistant
to PLX4720 as a single agent showed very large druginduced changes in transcription pattern. Importantly,
each line displayed different blocks of genes responding
to the various treatments. Each line’s transcriptional
response occupies an individual cluster, with few genes
demonstrating significant responses across multiple lines.
Using MSigDB, a tool that aggregates multiple
data bases, a pathway enrichment analysis was performed
inputting differentially expressed genes in response to
PLX4720 for the three lines that demonstrated synergy
(SKMEL24, SKMEL28, and DM331). 91 unique gene
sets were identified across the three sets of differentially
expressed genes, but only two were shared by all three
lines in response to PLX4720 alone: PID_AP1 and
PID_NFAT_TF. The AP1 and NFAT pathways are stress

response pathways that are nearly universal and were also
seen in the sensitive A375 line, and thus are not viewed as
signatures of cytotoxic synergy.
None of the lines showed large gene expression
changes in response to addition of lapatinib or masitinib
as single agents. Addition of the RTK inhibitors amplified
some of the transcriptional effects of PLX4720 treatment,
but what is most striking is that the majority of genes
whose expression is altered by RTK inhibition only
appear during combination treatment. Thus, it is clear
that the BRAF inhibition was creating the vulnerability
to the RTK inhibitor. Nevertheless there is considerable
divergence in the gene expression changes induced by
each RTK inhibitor and in each cell line. For example, of
the 37 transcriptional changes induced by the PLX4720lapatinib combination in DM331 cells, only 8 overlap with
the 13 induced by the PLX4720-masitinib combination
(Supplementary Figure S4 and Supplementary Table S2).
No MSigDB gene sets were found to be enriched for all
three lines post treatment with either combination. After
treatment with the combination, DM331 was the only line

that lost the enrichment for the PID_AP1_PATHWAY and
PID_NFAT_TFPATHWAY.
Potential mechanistic insight could be gained by
examination of individual gene lists that could be obscured
by aggregating the genes into the pathways defined by
standard databases. The lines displayed widely varying
transcriptional indicators of combination treatment
(Supplementary Table S2). DM331 responses centered
on ERBB pathway ligands (TGF-alpha, epiregulin,
neuregulin, HB-EGF) as well as other secreted growth
factors (CSF-1, VEGFA). Thus, the regulatory bias by
which DM331 presumably attains its resistance to BRAF
inhibition (expression of EGFR and NRG-1) is enhanced
in its adaptive response and inhibited at least in part by
lapatinib. SKMEL24 displayed unique cytokine responses
(IL-1, IRAK, IL-8, CXCL-1, CXCL-20) as well as
genes associated with migration and extracellular matrix
(Semaphorins, Serpin8, thrombospondin, and others).
SKMEL28 combination responsive genes centered on
ERBB pathway and cell cycle genes, including CDKN2A.

appeared in this list, notably the DUSPs (dual specificity
phosphatases). Thus, although a logical hypothesis and list
of potentially “actionable” targets could be constructed for
each individual cell line about how growth inhibition and
synergistic interactions might occur, no unifying themes
emerged that could be applied to all the lines.

appearing adaptive resistance to MAP Kinase pathway
inhibition. To accomplish this, we screened a panel
of 12 BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines for drugs or
small molecule inhibitors that were synergistically
cytotoxic with one of three MAP Kinase pathway
inhibitors (PLX4720, RAF265 or PD325901). We
found that no two cells were identical in their pattern
of combinatorial drug sensitivities, although all were
of the same developmental lineage, were driven by
mutationally activated BRAF, and had elevated levels
of MAP Kinase. This surprising result indicates that the
broad genetic and/or epigenetic landscape of these cells,
in addition to the primary oncogenic driver, determines
the cell signaling architecture and hence the mechanisms
of adaptation and resistance available to these cells. We
refer to these functionally significant secondary genetic
and epigenetic changes as “back-seat drivers.”

DISCUSSION
Combinatorial drug screening reveals diverse
adaptive survival responses of BRAF melanoma
cell lines
Because clinical responses to BRAF inhibitor
treatment of BRAF mutant melanomas are generally
incomplete, there is a compelling need to identify
actionable mechanisms of intrinsic and rapidly

More synergies were observed in combination
with RAF265 than with the other primary drugs. We
suspect that this is because RAF265 is the least selective
of the kinase inhibitors [100] and that some of the
synergistic cytotoxicities are generated by “off-target”
effects of RAF265. This raises the possibility that the
most effective agents to use in combination therapy will
be drugs that have multiple targets, a conclusion also
reached by Langdon et al and Girotti et al. [63, 101].
The panel of drugs synergistic with the MEK inhibitor,
PD325901, represents a subset of the drugs that enhanced
cytotoxicity of the BRAF inhibitor, PLX4720. Assuming
that PLX4720 effects are due solely to inhibition of RAF
family members, this suggests additional activities of RAF
beyond MAP Kinase activation, consistent with other
reports [102–106]. Although the use of small molecule
inhibitors in this analysis makes it difficult to draw
unambiguous conclusions about molecular mechanisms,
they potentially provide more clinical relevance than
would putatively more specific reagents such as shRNA.

feature of the adaptive response to PLX4720 in many
BRAF mutant melanomas. Consistent with this, groupwise analysis of gene expression of 4 resistant cell lines
treated as replicates (SKMEL28, VMM5A, VMM18,
DM13; excluding DM331 because of its high basal EGFR
expression) by Pathway Express showed upregulation
of genes associated with the ERBB pathway following
PLX4720 treatment [61]. Notably, group-wise analysis
allows modest but consistent changes to be identified
across a group of cell lines while they cannot be identified
by analyzing each cell line separately. The upregulation
of ERBB family members generates the vulnerability to
lapatinib inhibition in these lines.

Multiple adaptive survival pathways contribute
to RTK-dependent resistance to BRAF inhibition
We did not find that differences in the IC50 for
pERK inhibition nor the extent of MAP Kinase pathway
reactivation correlated with combination drug sensitivity
(Figures 4 and 5, Supplementary Figures 2 and 3)
indicating that resistance to PLX4720 via RTK activation
does not occur solely by reactivation of the MAP Kinase
pathway. Rather, our data indicate that resistance to
PLX4720 via RTK activation depends also on engagement
of other pathways known to be accessible to RTKs, such
as PI3K and JAK/STAT. Although data from patients
shows that therapeutic response correlates with MAP
Kinase pathway inhibition by vemurafenib [5, 108, 109]
we suggest that inhibition of MAP Kinase signaling by
RAF inhibitors is a necessary but not a sufficient condition
to achieve cytotoxicity.
It is widely recognized that a major mechanism of
resistance to MAP Kinase inhibition in cancer is generated
via the PI3 Kinase pathway. For example, Akt mutations
can play a role in acquired resistance to vemurafenib, and
Akt inhibitors and PI3 Kinase inhibitors can be synergistic
with BRAF inhibition [21, 24, 29, 37, 38, 56, 110–117].
In agreement with this, we observed that the PI3 Kinase
inhibitor PI-103 was synergistic with PLX4720 in some
of the resistant cell lines. OSU-03012, a putative PDK1
inhibitor, displayed synergistic benefit with PLX4720 in
all of the cell lines that were resistant or partially resistant
to the BRAFV600E inhibitor. Ronai and colleagues have
also pointed to an important role of PDK1 in melanoma
[99]. We therefore examined the effects of GSK2334470
which was developed as a specific PDK1 inhibitor, and
found that it also provided synergistic cytotoxicity with
PLX4720 in SKMEL24, a cell line where lapatinib
altered the profile of selected PI3 Kinase pathway
phosphorylations. Interestingly, the PDK1 inhibitor was
less effective at generating synergy in VMM5A, a cell line
where lapatinib addition to PLX4720 generated synergy
without apparent effects on PI3 Kinase signaling. These
data demonstrate that PLX4720-lapatinib synergy can be
achieved independent of effects on PI3 Kinase signaling
as well as MAP Kinase reactivation.

Signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases represents
a major source of adaptive resistance
Half of the cell lines tested, and all of the lines
displaying some level of intrinsic resistance to BRAF
inhibition, displayed enhanced cytotoxicity when
PLX4720 was combined with lapatinib, consistent
with the results of Held et al. [56]. The same lines also
responded to the combination of PLX4720 with masitinib,
an inhibitor of PDGFR, KIT and VEGFR tyrosine kinases,
but not of HER family kinases. These results suggest that
reduction in the total RTK activity rather than inhibition
of a specific RTK may be important for enhancing the
effectiveness of PLX4720. Consistent with this concept,
we found that gefitinib, which is selective for EGFR
and does not inhibit other HER family kinases, did not
achieve the 98th percentile synergy threshold obtained
with lapatinib although, as reported by Girotti, Marais and
colleagues [71, 72], some additive benefit was obtained
in some cell lines. Ng et al have reported that the panHER family inhibitor canertinib provides even greater
benefit [107] and Langdon et al. have recently reported
that dovitinib,a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, displays
synergistic benefit comparable to the combination of 6
separate kinase inhibitors [63]. These observations all
support the proposal that feedback-regulated activation
of RTKs is a central component of adaptive resistance in
melanomas, and that drug combinations that focus on this
causal agent have clinical potential.
RTK inhibitors had modest effects on gene
expression when used as single agents, but much larger
effects when combined with the BRAF inhibitor. This
indicates that, even though there is enormous diversity
in patterns of gene expression and of changes in protein
phosphorylation (as measured by RPPA) across individual
lines, upregulation of RTK dependency is a convergent

The fact that some cell lines sensitive to PDK1
inhibition were not sensitive to PI3 Kinase inhibition
indicates that even though PDK1 is “downstream” of PI3
Kinase, inhibition of these targets is not equivalent. This
agrees with the surprising results recently reported by
Scortegagna et. al. showing synergy between PI3K and
PDK1 inhibitors [35, 36] in BRAF mutant melanomas.
Collectively, our data demonstrate that there is
enormous diversity in the adaptive survival responses
to BRAF inhibition utilized by different BRAFV600E
melanomas, and that many of the changes observed
by molecular profiling are therapeutically irrelevant.
Thus, it will be extremely challenging to develop drug
combinations that specifically inhibit each significant
adaptive response. Our data suggest that drug
combinations that pair MAP Kinase pathway inhibition
with other individual intracellular signaling pathways,
such as PI3K, STAT or WNT, may not be as broadly useful
as combinations with an RTK inhibitor that dampens
multiple pathways. Thus we suggest that a combination
of MAP Kinase pathway inhibition with the addition of
an RTK inhibitor such as lapatinib is worthy of clinical
evaluation.

that altered the ability for synergistic interactions to be
manifest, so each lot was tested at 1.0% to 5% serum. A
dose response of each inhibitor used in the screen was
performed on a panel of cell lines to determine doses that
would result in approximately 15, 25, and 35% growth
inhibition. Cell lines were grown in their normal growth
media to 80% confluence and then were washed with 1x
PBS, trypsinized, collected, counted (via hemocytometer),
and resuspended in phenol-red free RPMI 1640 + FBS at
concentrations that would result in 80–90% confluence of
the vehicle-treated control wells after 3 days of growth.
Plating of the cells was carried out using the BioMek
NX workstation (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN).
90 μl of cell suspension was added per well in 96-well
format. Small molecular inhibitors were diluted to 10x
concentration and plated into master drug plates. The
BioMek NX workstation was used to add 10 μl of drug
from the master plates to each well. The cells were then
incubated for 3 days at 37°C and 5% CO2. Following
this incubation, the BioMek NX workstation was used to
add 10 μl of alamarBlue (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY)
to each well. The plates were incubated for 4 hours and
fluorescence was measured at 560 nm excitation/590 nm
emission on a Synergy 2 plate reader (BioTek Instruments,
Winooski, VT). Mean results and standard error were
calculated for triplicate samples.
The Bliss model of independence was used to
determine synergy [76, 77]. This model estimates the
combined effect of two drugs as the multiplicative effect
of each drug measured individually: Synergy Score
= CCombination − (1 – (1 – CSecondary Drug)*(1 –
CPrimary Drug)) where CCombination is the observed
cytotoxicity of the combination treatment, CSecondary
Drug is the observed cytotoxicity of the secondary
drug, and CPrimary Drug is the observed cytotoxicity
of the primary drug. Bliss independence assumes that
the two drugs act through independent mechanisms, and
is thought to be a reasonable baseline model for large
networks [77]. When the observed experimental data
match the predictions of Bliss independence, the inhibitors
are said to be additive whereas greater than predicted
potency indicates synergism and lower potency indicates
antagonism. An advantage of this method is that it can
score synergy even when one of the drugs is inactive as
a single agent.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture, antibodies, and reagents
SkMel28 cells (American Type Culture Collection;
ATCC; Rockville, MD), A375, DM13, DM331, DM6,
HT144, SKMel24, VMM12, VMM15, VMM17,
VMM18, and VMM5A (kind gift from Dr. Craig
Slingluff, University of Virginia) were propagated in
RPMI Medium 1640 (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY)
supplemented with 5% or 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;
Gemini Bio-Products, West Sacramento, CA). All cultures
were maintained in a humidified chamber at 37°C with
5% CO2. OncoMap analysis was conducted at the Broad
Institute to identify the mutational status of over 30
known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. The cell
lines were authenticated by comparing the tumor mutation
profile determined by OncoMap with published reports.
Antibodies were obtained from the following
sources: anti-phosphoERK and anti-total ERK (SigmaAldrich), and anti-tubulin (Calbiochem, Gibbstown, NJ).

a gift from Pfizer.

Animal studies
All experiments were carried out under an
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
approved protocol and institutional guidelines for
the proper and humane use of the animals in the
research were followed. Four- to six-week-old female
Hsd:Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu mice were obtained from
Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN) and maintained
in ventilated caging. Tumors were generated by injecting
1 × 107 cells in 1:1 Phosphate-Buffered Saline: Matrigel

Synthetic lethal pathway screen
Combinatorial drug screening was as described
previously [62]. In brief, prior to screening, plate density
that resulted in 80% confluence after three days of
incubation was determined for each cell line. We observed

into the dorsal flanks (2 sites per mouse). Mice were
anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 3 ml/kg of a
solution containing 25 mg/ml ketamine HCl, 2.5 mg/ml
xylazine, and 14% ethanol in 0.85% NaCl. Surgical sites
were prepped and cells were delivered with a 25 gauge
syringe in 100μl volumes. Tumors were allowed to grow
to an average volume of 400 mm3 ((length * width2)π/6)
and mice were randomized into groups for treatment. Mice
received vehicle control and/or control rodent diet, 200
mg/kg lapatinib (LC Laboratories) alone by oral gavage
once daily, rodent diet with 417 mg/kg plx4720 (Research
Diets, Inc. New Brunswick NJ), or plx4720 rodent diet plus
200 mg/kg lapatinib by gavage. Tumors were measured biweekly and mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation
under anesthesia when tumors reached 1000 mm3. A
random coefficient model was used to estimate mean tumor
growth following treatment initiation, assuming a quadratic
model and with a robust estimate of the covariance matrix
[118]. F-tests based on the random coefficient models were
used to compare the groups. Analyses were carried out in
SAS 9.4, PROC MIXED.

Statistical analysis of functional genomics and
genomics data
Illumina microarray data was variance stabilized
transformed [120, 121] using the lumi Bioconductor
package in R [122]. Differentially expressed genes
were identified using limma to perform moderated ttests and derive Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery
Rate (FDR) adjusted p-values [123, 124] and applying
a 1% FDR threshold. Differentially expressed genes
were clustered using the R package pvclust [125] with
the Pearson correlation distance measure and average
linkage. We assessed the significance of the clusters by
performing 1000 iterations of the clustering introducing
random variations and assessing how much randomness
was required to lose a specific branch. Normalized log2
reverse phase protein array (RPPA) data was generated
using methods described in [121]. We performed a paired
t-test in limma to identify epitopes which were affected by
treatment using a 1% FDR.

Immunoblot analysis
Cells were allowed to adhere to plates overnight
before being treated with inhibitors or vehicle control
in phenol red-free RPMI Medium 1640 (Invitrogen,
Grand Island, NY) without fetal bovine serum for 1, 8,
or 24 hours at 37°C. Cells were rinsed with cold 1x PBS
containing phosphatase inhibitors, calyculin A and
orthovanadate, and lysed in Triton lysis buffer [10%
