ABSTRACT:
Identifying cancer-specific biomarkers represents an ongoing challenge to the
development of novel cancer diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies. Cancer/
testis (CT) genes are an important gene family with expression tightly restricted to
the testis in normal individuals but which can also be activated in cancers. Here
we develop a pipeline to identify new CT genes. We analysed and validated expression profiles of human meiotic genes in normal and cancerous tissue followed by
meta-analyses of clinical data sets from a range of tumour types resulting in the
identification of a large cohort of highly specific cancer biomarker genes, including
the recombination hot spot activator PRDM9 and the meiotic cohesin genes
SMC1beta and RAD21L. These genes not only provide excellent cancer biomarkers
for diagnostics and prognostics, but may serve as oncogenes and have excellent
drug targeting potential.

recognised as ‘self’ by the immune system, limiting their
use in immune therapeutic, prognostic and diagnostic
technologies. One family of proteins, the so-called
cancer/testis (CT) antigens, represents an excellent group
of cancer-specific biomarkers [14-21]. These are produced in the testes of healthy male adults and can also
be found in cells with a cancerous phenotype. The immunological privilege of the testis [22,23] makes the CT
antigens excellent immunological targets and a number
of CT antigens have been employed successfully in a
range of clinical applications, including adoptive therapeutics for late stage cancer treatment [for example,
see 24]. Some CT antigens are also present in other
immunologically privileged tissues of the central nervous

INTRODUCTION
The demarcation of neoplastic cells from healthy
tissue represents an important goal in clinical oncology; this is of particular interest given the need for
diagnostic markers to enable early intervention strategies, such as surgical resection, and the re-emergence
of immunotherapeutics, cancer vaccines and targeted
drug delivery via antibody-drug conjugates [1-10].
To achieve this goal, the identification of tumourassociated antigens is of central importance [for example, see 11-13]. Whilst almost all cancer cells have
an altered gene expression profile, including many up
regulated genes, most of the associated antigens are

system (CNS) and these are referred to as cancer/testisCNS (CT/CNS) antigens [25].
Many genes have been purported to encode CT
antigens [21], however, not all of these have endured
continued scrutiny and many of the genes have subsequently been found to have some degree of expression
in normal somatic tissues [25]. This has lead to the redefining of CT genes into testis (and CNS)-restricted and
testis (and CNS)-selective, where there is some evidence
to indicate the latter class are expressed in at least one
non-immune privileged, normal tissue type [25,26].
CT antigens have been further sub-classified into
those which are encoded by genes on the X chromosome
(X-CT genes) and those which are encoded by genes on
autosomes (non-X-CT genes) [14-21]. The majority of
characterised testis-restricted CT genes are X-CT genes
and many of these reside within large families of orthologous genes, such as the MAGE family [14-21,27]. In
addition, some CT genes are co-expressed in the same
cancerous tissue, suggesting a dysfunction in one or
more, as yet uncharacterised, testis-specific transcriptional regulatory pathway(s) [for example, see 28].
It has been demonstrated that some CT antigens
have the potential for oncogenic activity or contribute
to maintaining or enhancing the neoplastic state [19].
For example, MAGE-A2 has been demonstrated to
induce the down regulation of one of the primary tumour
suppressor genes, p53 [29]. Furthermore, MAGE-A2
and another MAGE family member, MAGE-A6, have
been demonstrated to have the potential to induce
resistance to chemotherapeutic agents [30]. However,
the function, the oncogenic activity and the drug
resistance-inducing potential of CT antigens remains
poorly studied considering the potential importance of
these proteins.
There has been speculation that some CT antigens
could function in the testes to mediate the meiotic programme [31,32]. During meiosis the chromosomes of
diploid progenitor cells (spermatogonia in testis) become
reductionally segregated to produce haploid gametes
(sperm cells in testis) [33,34]. This meiotic chromosome
segregation involves a complex and poorly understood
series of events, which include the pairing of homologous chromosomes followed by a covalent conjoining
to generate a bivalent which is required for chromatid
alignment at the first meiotic division. It has been
postulated that the aberrant production of CT antigens
with chromosome modulating potential in mitotically
dividing somatic cells could result in inappropriate nonallelic inter-/intra-chromosomal recombination and interhomologue recombination events which could generate
oncogenic genetic changes such as translocations and
losses of heterozygocity [21,31,32]. In addition, the aberrant expression of meiotic chromosome regulators in
matched induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has
been demonstrated to illicit an immune response to

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

iPSC-induced teratomas in mice indicating a broader
importance to understanding the consequences of aberrant expression of meiotic genes [35].
In male mammals there exists a unique mechanism for the meiosis-specific transcriptional silencing of
the X chromosome during the meiotic zygotene to
pachytene transition, which is dependent upon meiotic
double-strand break formation in unpaired chromatin
[36]. This meiotic X inactivation suggests that most of
the genes encoding known testis-restricted CT antigens
are silenced during meiosis, as most of these are
X-encoded and so may have largely non-meiotic roles in
the testis.
These findings lead us to postulate that there is
a family of human meiosis-specific genes, which are
autosomally encoded and therefore not subjected to
meiotic X inactivation. If these genes are aberrantly
expressed in cancers and iPSCs they might represent
a clinically important, novel sub-class of the testisrestricted CT gene family. Moreover, we speculated
that such genes might have oncogenic activity by
encoding proteins which interfere with chromosome
dynamics and cell division when aberrantly expressed
in mitotically dividing somatic cells. Here we identify
human meiosis-specific genes showing the characteristics of CT genes, which we designate meiCT genes.
This work defines a novel, meiosis-specific sub-class of
clinically-relevant CT genes which includes previously
uncharacterised human testis-specific genes, the human
meiotic hotspot regulator gene PRDM9, the meiotic regulator gene STRA8 and meiosis-specific sister chromatid
cohesion regulator genes.

RESULTS
Analysis of selected meiotic chromosome
regulatory genes for CT gene candidature
Some important meiosis-specific genes which
encode chromosome modulators have previously been
reported to be CT genes, including SPO11 which encodes a meiosis-specific nuclease required for the initiation of meiotic recombination [15]; however, many
of these previously identified meiotic regulators
(including, SPO11, HORMAD1, SYCE1, SYCP1) have
subsequently been found to be selective in their expression profile, suggesting they are not strictly testisrestricted [25]. As a first step to address the possibility
that additional meiosis-specific genes might encode
highly restricted CT antigens, we selected from the literature a sample cohort of human genes predicted to have
meiosis-specific expression (Supplementary Table S1).
These included genes encoding subunits of the meiosisspecific cohesin complex (REC8, STAG3, SMC1beta,
RAD21L), which is responsible for modulating meiotic

recombination, meiotic centromere monopolarity and
meiotic sister chromatid cohesion [37,38]. To assess the
meiotic specificity of the selected genes, we obtained
RNA extracted from a panel of normal human tissues,
including testis, ovary and CNS tissue. We designed
intron-spanning primer sets for the genes of interest
and carried out reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) analysis as described in the materials
and methods. Surprisingly, a number of these genes were
expressed in a wide range of normal tissues, suggesting
that their expression is not exclusively meiosis-specific
(Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S1A). These included two
genes encoding cohesin components, REC8 and STAG3,
the protein products of which are widely accepted as
being meiosis-specific from studies in other organisms,
including the mouse [for example, 39]. Taking this
further, we detected some expression of both REC8
and STAG3 in mouse non-meiotic somatic tissue using
our RT-PCR conditions (Supplementary Fig. S1B),
suggesting that expression of these genes is not fully

restricted to meiosis, rather, they are subjected to a
meiotic up regulation, consistent with previous analyses in the mouse [for example, 40]. DNA sequencing
was used to confirm the identity of all RT-PCR products from both mouse and human. RT-PCR followed by DNA sequencing confirmed that a number
of other genes we had postulated would be testis /
meiosis-specific were expressed more extensively in
non-meiotic tissues (Supplementary Fig. S1A; Supplementary Table S1). Despite the detection of REC8
and STAG3 expression in normal tissue, the other
two meiosis cohesin genes tested, RAD21L and SMC1beta, exhibited a tight testis-specific expression profile
(Fig. 1A). To explore whether these testis-specific
cohesin genes could potentially encode CT antigens
we analysed their expression using RT-PCR on RNA
samples taken from cancer cell lines and tumour
samples from a range of cancer types. For both genes,
expression was detected in a number of the cancer cells
indicating they are CT genes (Fig. 1A). Of the other

manually selected genes a further five exhibited a
CT gene expression profile (a mixture of cancer/
testis-restricted and cancer/testis/CNS-restricted); these
were the meiotic recombination hotspot activator gene
PRDM9, the nuclear protein in testis (NUT) gene, the
testis-specific serine/threonine kinase 1 (TSSK1) gene,
the synaptonemal complex component gene SYCP1
(which has previously been reported as a CT gene [18])
and the meiotic regulatory gene STRA8 (Fig. 1A).
A sixth gene, TEX19, exhibited a testis-selective expression profile as it was expressed in the testis and the thymus, the latter being a tissue known to undergo
atrophy in older individuals such as those from which
this tissue was derived, which may account for the
expression of this gene in the thymus; TEX19 also exhibited extensive expression in many cancer types (Fig. 1A).
To address whether an expressed gene might be
translated into a protein product, which might therefore provide an antigenic target in clinical applications, we carried out western blot analysis to detect
the protein product of one of the CT genes identified
above, PRDM9, for which commercial antibodies
were available. The intracellular nature of these antigens does not preclude them from serving as targets
for monoclonal antibody therapies or other immunotherapeutic approaches [for example, 24,41,42].
We generated whole cell extracts (WCEs) from one
of the cancer cell lines in which PRDM9 gene expression had been observed, NTERA-2 (Fig. 1A), and a
culture of non-cancerous primary human prostate
smooth muscle (HPrSM) cells, in which no PRDM9
gene expression could be detected by RT-PCR.
PRDM9 was readily detectable in the cancer cells,
but not in the HPrSM cells (Fig. 1C) demonstrating
that the expression of the PRDM9 CT gene results in
protein production, leading to the possibility that the
de-repression of the PRDM9 gene generates a protein
which could be antigenic and thus be of clinical and
oncogenic importance.

human orthologue assignment and filtering to eliminate
non-testis-specific genes, 375 human genes remained

Identification and validation of novel
meiosis-associated CT genes using
computational analysis of EST data
Whilst the above approach has identified a number of new CT genes, it is limited by the fact that a
manual curation of the literature is not only timeconsuming, but also exposes relatively few mammalian
meiosis-specific genes. We took advantage of a previous large scale microarray study which identified
an extensive cohort of genes with expression associated
specifically with meiosis and spermatocyte development in mammals [43]. We used this to conduct a
systematic approach to identify new meiosis-associated
human CT genes. The mouse study provided a starting

scale microarray study [43], 744 mouse meiosis-specific genes
were selected as a starting point: 408 human orthologues
could be identified and 375 human meiosis-specific genes
remained after filtering to eliminate non-testis specific genes.
All 375 candidates as well as 3 controls (MAGE-A1, GAGE1
and SSX2) were fed into the EST analysis pipeline, which
returned 105 candidate genes which were subjected to RTPCR validation/microarray meta-analysis. Support text to

Supplementary Information). Briefly, if a candidate
gene is represented in a non-testis / non-CNS normal
tissue EST library, it was dismissed. The remaining genes
were further assessed for representation in cancer EST
libraries. This screen identified 177 candidate genes, of
which 9 were cancer/testis-restricted (class 1), 75 were
testis-restricted (class 2), 21 were cancer/testis/CNSrestricted (class 3) and 72 were testis/CNS-restricted
(class 4). We favoured an EST screen, since microarray
technology is limited by the number of published cancer
arrays available as well as by the number of genes which
can be analysed due to lack of gene coverage on arrays.
Moreover, an EST screen can confirm the testis-restricted
expression pattern and therefore functions as an additional filter to eliminate non-testis-restricted genes.
However, microarray data sets were not ignored and
following experimental validation of the candidates (see
below) we carried out meta-analysis of clinically-relevant
cancer microarray data sets (see below).
Having identified candidates in the four classes
outlined above we validated those in classes 1-3 using
RT-PCR. We included the genes in class 2, which are
predicted to be testis-specific, but have not been identified in the EST data sets of cancer tissue. We initially
carried out RT-PCR on RNA isolated from a range of
normal human tissues, including testis-derived RNA,
as described above. Of the 105 genes in classes 1-3
we could not obtain RT-PCR products in our control
tissue (testis) for 12 genes, resulting in 93 genes which
were subjected to RT-PCR validation. Of these,
39 genes were expressed in more than two non-testis/
CNS normal tissues and were therefore dismissed at
this stage. Of the remaining 54 genes, 41 had expression restricted to testis in normal tissues, 3 had expression restricted to testis and CNS tissue and 10 were
testis-specific, or testis/CNS-specific and yet exhibited
expression in one or two normal tissues. RT-PCR analysis was carried out to assess the expression profiles of
these 54 genes in cancer cells, as above. From these
analyses it was determined that 29 genes exhibited no
expression in any of the cancerous material and
appeared to be tightly testis-specific (Supplementary
Table S2; the example of C5orf47 is shown in Fig. 1A);
12 were CT-restricted genes and they were expressed
in the testis and at least one cancer type (the example
of C1orf65 is shown in Fig. 1A; Fig. 3); 3 were cancer/testis/CNS-restricted genes as they were expressed
in testis, CNS and at least one cancer type (Fig. 3); 6
were cancer/testis-selective as they were expressed in
testis, one or two other non-testis/CNS normal tissues
and at least one cancer type (Fig. 3); 4 were cancer/
testis/CNS-selective as they were expressed in testis,
CNS tissue, one or two other normal tissue types and
at least one cancer type (Fig. 3). This resulted in the
identification of a total of 25 genes distributed in
the various CT classes. This, in combination with the

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

8 CT genes identified in the preliminary study (see
above) resulted in the identification of 33 restricted /
selective CT or CT/CNS genes, most of which have
not been previously characterised as CT genes and
are largely autosomally encoded; we will refer to these
as meiCT genes (Fig. 3).

Meta-analysis of validated candidate genes
To explore the clinical relevance of the 33 meiCT
genes we have identified, we developed a meta-analysis
pipeline for patient-derived cancer microarray data
including 13 cancer types (Fig. 2; support text to
Fig. 2 is given in Supplementary Information; Supplementary Table S3). We analysed the meta-change in
gene expression of patient-derived, untreated cancerous tissues compared to normal tissues for the candidates as well as for 3 known X-CT control genes
(MAGE-A1, GAGE, SSX2) in a total of 80 microarray
data sets (Supplementary Table S3). Of the 33 candidates, 25 were covered by the array sets and could be
evaluated (Supplementary Table S4). This revealed
that 15 of the meiCT genes exhibited statistically significant, cancer-specific mean up regulation in at least
one cancer type for combined data sets for specific
cancer types where enough clinically-derived data sets
were available (Fig. 4; Supplementary Table S4). The
Circos plot (Fig. 4) shows the meta-change in gene
expression in relation to the corresponding cancer type.
This provides evidence that the meiCT genes are
expressed in clinically-relevant material and shows
examples of more extensive tumour expression patterns.
Some notable patterns emerge from these analyses;
firstly, many of the meiCT genes show a mean up regulation in ovarian, brain and lung cancers; secondly, a
number of cancer types exhibit no mean up regulation
of any of the analysed meiCT genes, these include breast
and colorectal, for which 11 and 13 microarray data sets
were available. However, a limited number of microarray data sets were available for many cancer types and
thus designating cancer specificity from these data has
limitations.
Whilst a significant mean up regulation is observed for a number of genes in combined data sets
for distinct cancer types (Fig. 4), this does not reflect
a uniform up regulation of a specific gene in all samples for a given cancer type. For example, PRDM9
exhibits a significant mean up regulation in the ovarian cancer microarray sets used (Fig. 4); however, it
is not significantly up regulated in all the individual
cancer samples tested, despite the significant mean
elevation (Fig. 5). This indicates that these markers
may not be universally up regulated in specific cancer
sub-types or cancer samples. Extending this, we determined that a further number of clinically-derived cancer samples exhibited up regulation of a wider range of

genes are expressed in clinically-relevant samples covering a broad range of cancer types.
The meta-analysis approach was extended to
address whether any of the 29 genes ascribed as testisspecific (no evidence for expression in any of the
cancer cells we tested) by RT-PCR analysis, were up
regulated in the clinically-derived microarray data
sets. Of the 29 genes, 21 were represented on the arrays
(Supplementary Table S2). Meta-analysis of combined

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cancer data sets revealed that 9 of these genes showed
a significant mean up regulation in leukaemias and
lung and ovarian cancers (Fig. 6). These findings indicate that these further 9 genes qualify as meiCT genes,
bringing the total number of meiCT genes identified
in this study to 42 (Supplementary Table S5), many of
which are novel genes which have not been classified
as cancer biomarkers. Additionally, analysis of individual (not combined) cancer data sets revealed up regulation of 19 of the 21 genes in a broader range of cancer
types (Supplementary Fig. S2B), indicating that a
further 10 genes could be considered as meiCT genes.

important oncological biomarkers. However, the classification of CT genes remains fraught with difficulties
and it has been proposed that a uniform classification
is premature until a greater insight into the biology
and clinical importance of CT genes is revealed [25].
Here we add a new group of genes to this expanding
family, the meiCT genes, which not only have expression restricted to the testis, but are likely to be further
restricted to the highly immunologically privileged
meiotic spermatocytes. These are more widely represented on the autosomes than previously characterised
CT genes (45 of the 52 meiCT genes are autosomally
encoded; Supplementary Table S5) and their identification opens up new possibilities in terms of both tumour
distribution and oncogenic activities. Analysis of the
meiCT genes demonstrates that these are expressed
in a wide range of cancer types. For example, our
RT-PCR validation demonstrates expression of a number of meiCT genes, including PRDM9, in lymphoma
and leukaemia lines (Fig. 1A; Fig. 3). Of the 46 genes
subjected to meta-analysis (combined cancer data sets),
20 were expressed in ovarian cancers. The use of CT

DISCUSSION
The restricted regulation of CT genes has resulted in the emergence of their associated antigens as

has yielded positive results (for example, see 44), and so
the finding that the meiCT genes are extensively
expressed in ovarian cancers could provide an additional suite of markers for a tumour type which is
amenable to immunotherapeutic approaches. In addition to the meta-analysis, study of individual cancer
data sets (cancer vs. normal) suggested expression of
additional meiCT genes (42 out of the 44 represented
on microarrays) in a broader range of cancer sub-types
(Fig. 6; Supplementary Fig. S2; Supplementary Table
S5); however, the extent to which these single data set
analyses reflect extensive expression in a given cancer
type will rely on the generation of further clinicallyderived data sets and their subsequent analyses,
whereas meta-analyses are generally accepted to indicate a more precise and reliable estimate of gene expression for a given cancer type.
In our original computational analysis we applied
relatively stringent conditions to the classification of
the meiCT genes. We only selected candidates for validation which were not represented in EST libraries of any
non-testis / non-CNS normal tissue types. Chen and
co-workers [26] challenged EST data sets with testisspecific genes identified by massive parallel sequencing
and retained those genes with expression in one or two
other non-testis normal tissues. Indeed, when we re-ran
our analysis setting the criteria with this same lower
stringency we identified a significant number of additional candidates. We took the more stringent approach
so as to target meiCT genes which were tightly restricted
CT genes. However, on validation we revealed a number
of meiCT genes which fall into the CT (and CT/CNS)
selective class. This might be due to the nature of
the so-called normal tissue; as in our case, RNA from
many normal tissues are extracted from tissue obtained
post mortem and are often pooled from tissues from a
number of individuals, many of whom were aged at time
of death. It remains a possibility that some of these
tissues had undergone undiagnosed neoplastic change
and might have been aberrantly expressing one or more
of the candidate genes. In support of this, Chen and
co-workers [26] observed expression of some genes in
tissues from one panel of normal tissues, but detected
no measurable expression in similar tissue types from a
distinct second source. Thus, genes which exhibit meiCT
selective profiles, such as TEX19, might indeed be CT
restricted genes and be of clinical use.

effect [18,32] and indeed, aberrant expression of germ
line genes in Drosophila contributes to malignant
growth [45]; when this idea is applied to the genes
identified here it opens up some interesting possibilities, which might indicate that the meiCT genes might
not only be oncogenic, but might also provide drug
targeting opportunities. For example, the meiotic
cohesin genes RAD21L and SMC1beta may produce
proteins which are incorporated into functional cohesin complexes within mitotically dividing tissues; this
may not only result in aberrant modulation of chromosome segregation resulting in genome instability,
but might also provide a cancer cell-specific drug target to inhibit chromosome segregation.
The expression of the meiotic recombination
hotspot activator gene PRDM9 is intriguing as the
gene product is a sequence-specific zinc finger histone
methyltransferase known to regulate the epigenetic
programme for hotspot chromatin activation [46,47]
and in mice the orthologue, Meisetz, has a function
in transcriptional regulation where it activates expression of the testis-specific RIK gene, amongst others
[48]. We could find no evidence that any of the human
orthologues of RIK were differentially activated in
cancer cells expressing PRDM9, but the possibility
remains that active PRDM9 protein in somatic cells
might trigger unscheduled transcriptional activity and/
or generate regions with altered chromatin structure
which could form unstable chromatin lesions, both of
which could be oncogenic in nature.
In addition to identifying the meiCT genes, we
found expression in non-testis tissues of a number of
genes which are reported as meiosis-specific, including
REC8 and STAG3. This is not inconsistent with previous studies, where these genes are reported to be up
regulated in the testis and are not testis-restricted.
Why might some genes, which encode meiosis-specific
functions, be less tightly regulated than others? The
answer to this could come from studies in the fission
yeast were the production of Rec8 protein in mitotic
cells is inhibited by specific post-transcriptional mRNA
degradation [49,50]. If an analogous system were operating in mammals then many CT antigen genes might
be missed using transcriptional profiling alone; REC8
and STAG3 might prove to be good genes on which
to test this idea. This raises the possibility that CT antigens can be generated not only by transcriptional dysfunction, but also by the de-regulation of translational
repression programmes which ensure spermatocyte-/
testis-specific translation.

Meiotic chromosome regulators as CT genes
Here we have identified a number of previously
uncharacterised genes as meiCT genes; for example,
C12orf12. However, we also find that a number of
relatively well characterised meiotic genes are meiCT
genes. It has been previously proposed that the aberrant expression of CT genes may have an oncogenic

incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. The aqueous phase was transferred to a clean tube following
centrifugation at 12,000 g for 15 minutes at 4°C. The
RNA was precipitated out of solution using isopropanol
(10 minutes at room temperature and centrifuged at
12,000 g for 20 minutes at 4°C). RNA preparations were
re-suspended in RNase-free water containing DNase.
The concentration and quality of RNA was measured
using a NanoDrop (ND_1000). 1.0 µg of total RNA
was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript
III First Strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen™) as per the
manufacturer’s instructions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture
The NTERA-2 (clone D1) cell line was gifted by
Prof. P.W. Andrews (University of Sheffield) and are
regularly authenticated within the group using standard
antibody tests using anti-OCT4 antibodies and retinoic
acid-induced differentiation. The A2780 cell line was
provided by Prof. P. Workman (Cancer Research UK
Centre for Cancer Therapeutics, Surrey, UK) and was
authenticated at source. The following cell lines were
purchased from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (ECACC); 1321N1, COLO800, COLO857, G-361,
HCT116, HT29, LoVo, MM127, SW480 and T84.
H460 was purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC), and the two ovarian adenocarcinoma
cell lines, PEO14 and TO14, were obtained from Cancer
Research Technology Ltd. Primary cultures of proliferating human prostate smooth muscle cells were obtained
from PromoCell™ (C-12574). All cultures were used
within a six month period of obtaining validated lines
from external sources.
1321N1, A2780, NTERA-2 (clone D1) and SW480
cell lines were cultured in Invitrogens Dubeco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM + GLATAMAX™) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS). COLO800,
COLO857 and H460 cell lines were cultured in Invitrogens Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium
(RPMI 1640) + GLUTAMAX™ with 10% FBS.
PEO14 and TO14 cell lines were cultured in RPMI
1640 + GLUTAMAX™ supplemented with 10% FBS
and 2 mM sodium pyruvate, and MM127 was cultured
in RPMI 1640 + GLUTAMAX™ supplemented with
10% FBS and 25 mM HEPES. Invitrogens McCoy’s
5A medium + GLUTAMAX™ supplemented with 10%
FBS was used to culture the G-361, HCT116 and HT29
cell lines. Ham’s F12 + DMEM (1:1) + GLUTAMAX™
(Invitrogen™) with 10% FBS was used to culture T84
cells.
All cell lines were grown in a 37°C incubator with
5% CO2, with the exception of the NTERA-2 (clone
D1) cell line which was grown at 37°C with 10% CO2.

RT-PCR
The sequences for each of the genes analysed
were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Primers
to each of the genes were designed to span exons
where possible using Primer3 software (available from:
www.genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3www.cgi;
primer sequences are available upon request).
A volume of 2 µL diluted cDNA (containing
~150 ng/µl cDNA) was used for PCR in a 50 µL final
volume. BioMix™ Red (Bioline™) was used for PCR
amplification. Samples were amplified with a precycling hold at 96°C for 5 minutes, followed by 40
cycles of denaturing at 96°C for 30 seconds, annealing
at a temperature between 58-62°C for 30 seconds and
extension at 72°C for 40 seconds followed by a final
extension step at 72°C for 5 minutes. The products
were separated on 1% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide.

Western blot analysis
Whole cell protein lysates were prepared from cells
using lysis buffer {50 mM Tris-HCl pH7.4, 200 mM
sodium chloride, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mM AEBSF
[4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride] with complete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)}
and Laemmli buffer. The samples were boiled and an aliquot containing 60,000 cells was subjected to denaturing
gel electrophoresis using a NuPAGE™ 4-12% Bis-Tris
gel (Invitrogen™) and transferred to a PVDF membrane
(Millipore™). Membranes were blocked for one hour
using 1xPBST (0.3% Tween-20) containing 5% non-fat
dry milk, followed by an overnight incubation at 4°C
with rabbit polyclonal anti-PRDM9 antibody (Abcam;
ab85654) at a dilution of 1:1,000, or mouse monoclonal
anti-tubulin antibody (Sigma cat. no. T6074) at a

dilution of 1:5,000, or goat polyclonal anti-lamin antibody (Santa Cruz cat. no. sc-6217) at a dilution of
1:1,000. Membranes were washed using 1xPBST and
incubated with either goat, mouse or rabbit HRPconjugated IgG antibody dependent upon the primary
antibody. ECL detection reagents were then used for
visulisation (SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate; Thermo Scientific).
