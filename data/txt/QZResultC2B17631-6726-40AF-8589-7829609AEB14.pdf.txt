Abstract
We previously identified 1-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-(1-methylindolyl) propenone
(IPP51), a new chalcone derivative that is capable of inducing prometaphase arrest
and subsequent apoptosis of bladder cancer cells. Here, we demonstrate that IPP51
selectively inhibits proliferation of tumor-derived cells versus normal non-tumor
cells. IPP51 interfered with spindle formation and mitotic chromosome alignment.
Accumulation of cyclin B1 and mitotic checkpoint proteins Bub1 and BubR1 on
chromosomes in IPP51 treated cells indicated the activation of spindle-assembly
checkpoint, which is consistent with the mitotic arrest. The antimitotic actions of other
chalcones are often associated with microtubule disruption. Indeed, IPP51 inhibited
tubulin polymerization in an in vitro assay with purified tubulin. In cells, IPP51
induced an increase in soluble tubulin. Furthermore, IPP51 inhibited in vitro capillarylike tube formation by endothelial cells, indicating that it has anti-angiogenic activity.
Molecular docking showed that the indol group of IPP51 can be accommodated in
the colchicine binding site of tubulin. This characteristic was confirmed by an in vitro
competition assay demonstrating that IPP51 can compete for colchicine binding to
soluble tubulin. Finally, in a human bladder xenograft mouse model, IPP51 inhibited
tumor growth without signs of toxicity. Altogether, these findings suggest that IPP51
is an attractive new microtubule-targeting agent with potential chemotherapeutic
value.

and depolymerization, and these dynamics are important
for many cellular processes, the most dramatic of which
being mitosis. Several natural and synthetic drugs inhibit
microtubule dynamics leading to mitotic arrest and
subsequent cell apoptosis. For example, paclitaxel, vincaalkaloids and epothilones are currently used to treat a
variety of human cancers [2]. However, their clinical
success is often limited by severe side effects, such

Microtubules, composed of αβ-tubulin heterodimers,
are key components of the cytoskeleton. Microtubules
form hollow rods and are essential in a variety of
fundamental processes, such as cell division, intracellular
transport, maintenance of cell shape and polarity [1].

as neurotoxicity, poor accessibility of the drug due to
multidrug resistance transporters and drug resistance due
to tubulin mutations [2, 3]. Therefore, there is a continuing
need for the development of novel anti-microtubule drugs.
Flavonoids are naturally occurring polyphenols that
are widely distributed throughout the plant kingdom. They
are classified into several subclasses, including chalcones,
flavones, flavanones, flavonols and aurones. In plants,
they are biosynthesized through a key step involving
the cyclization of chalcones (1,3-diphenylpropanoids),
which are flavonoid precursors. Flavonoids are frequently
recommended as preventive agents against several
diseases. For instance, Asians, who ingest more flavonoids
in their diet than populations in the Western hemisphere,
have much lower risks of colon, prostate and breast
cancers, and this raises the question of whether flavonoids
can serve as natural chemopreventive and anticancer
agents [4-6]. Various molecules derived from flavonoids
have been studied in vitro and in vivo to determine
their potential anticancer activities [7, 8]. For example,
quercetin, a natural flavonol, is an inhibitor of different
kinases involved in cancer progression, such as epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR), cyclin-dependent kinases
and Aurora-A [9, 10]. Clinical trials were performed on
quercetin and have yielded encouraging results, but further
studies are needed to determine its possible use in adjuvant
cancer therapy [11, 12]. Flavopiridol, a semi-synthetic
flavone, was the first inhibitor of cyclin-dependent
kinases tested in human clinical trials to treat chronic
lymphocytic leukemia patients [13, 14]. Clinical phase
I/II trials have demonstrated the efficacy of flavopiridol
in high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients,
although side effects, such as hyperacute tumor lysis
syndrome, limit its use [15]. However, the administration
of flavopiridol following a new schedule was recently
shown to be effective and to have limited toxicity for the
treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma [16]. While these
studies demonstrated that tested flavonoids retain their
anticancer properties in vivo, they also showed that the
bioavailability of flavonoids are often limited and that
efficacious doses often lead to unwanted side effects, such
as liver failure and anemia [17]. In this context, our goal
was to develop more efficient flavonoids that are active
against bladder carcinoma [18-21]. Bladder cancer is the
10th most common cancer worldwide, with the highest
rates being reported in Europe, North America and
Australia, and it caused approximately 150,000 deaths
worldwide in 2008 [22]. Age is a notable risk factor for
the development of bladder cancer, but the greatest risk
is exposure to aromatic amines, which are found in the
products of chemical industries and in hair dyes, paints
and cigarette smoke [23]. Approximately 70% of newly
diagnosed bladder tumors are non-muscle-invasive, but
approximately 50-70% of these tumors recur and 10-20%
progress to muscle-invasive disease [24]. Since the 1980s,
the standard treatment for advanced bladder cancer has
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

been MVAC, a combination of methotrexate, vinblastine,
doxorubicin and cisplatin [25]. This regimen results in
a median survival duration of 13 to 15 months, and no
other drug combination has generated a better survival
rate [26]. Despite its clinical activity, the MVAC regimen
has some limitations, such as a relatively short response
duration and significant toxicities. Bladder cancer poses a
significant economic burden for the following reasons: the
need for lifetime surveillance, the treatment of recurrent
tumors, and the cost of complications associated with
treatment; thus, new chemotherapeutic agents are urgently
needed [27].
We
have
recently
identified
1-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-(1-methylindolyl) propenone
(IPP51) (Figure 1A), a new chalcone derivative that
is able to inhibit bladder cancer cell proliferation [19].
Chalcones target different cellular proteins, such as
tubulin, phospholipase A2 and DNA topoisomerase [2830]. IPP51 is a member of the methoxylated chalcones,
which are known to be potent antimitotic agents [31,
32]. Interestingly, it is known that inhibitors of tubulin
polymerization, such as combretastatin A and colchicine,
are also rich in methoxy groups [33, 34]. The antimitotic
activity of chalcones could also be attributed to the
enone moiety of these molecules, which can interact
with a critical thiol residue in the colchicine binding site
of tubulin [35, 36]. Indeed, we have shown that IPP51
treatment induces cell cycle arrest at the G2+M phases,
which leads to apoptotic cell death through caspase-3
activation. The antimitotic effect of IPP51 on bladder
cancer cell lines, the fact that indolyl-appended chalcones
have never been investigated as colchicine-like agents and
the ease with which IPP51 was synthesized prompted us to
further characterize the mechanism of action of IPP51 and
its potential interaction with tubulin. In the present study,
we show that IPP51 binds to the colchicine binding site
of tubulin and inhibits the polymerization of microtubules
both in vitro and in cellulo. Furthermore, the results of our
in vivo studies in mice show that IPP51 can inhibit the
growth of bladder cancer xenografts. Overall, our results
demonstrate that IPP51 is a novel anti-microtubule agent.

RESULTS
Selective effect of IPP51 on tumor cells
Our chalcone-derivative IPP51 was previously
tested in different bladder cancer cell lines isolated
from bladder tumors of different grades and stages that
mimic the bladder tumor progression process [19]. The
IC50 of IPP51 (concentration resulting in 50% loss of cell
viability) was found to be 5 µM for cell lines derived
from low grade tumors (RT4 and RT112 cell lines) and
approximately 50 µM for cell lines derived from high

grade tumors (T24, TCCSUP and J82 cell lines). To
determine if IPP51 had specific activity against tumor
cells, it was tested in HeLa cells (derived from a cervical
cancer) and immortalized normal human cell lines:
urothelial cells, the TERT-NHU cell line [44] and human
fetal lung fibroblasts, the IMR-90 cell line. As observed
previously in bladder cancer cells, IPP51 inhibited HeLa
cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50
value of 4.4 ± 0.4 µM. Interestingly, IPP51 did not affect
the proliferation of TERT-NHU cells at 5 µM, which is
its IC50 for RT112 cells (Figure 1B). Importantly, even
at the higher IPP51 concentration (50 µM), it remained
inactive against TERT-NHU cells. Furthermore, IPP51 had
little effect on IMR-90 cell proliferation. Even at IPP51
concentrations up to 50 µM, the viability of IMR-90 cells
was approximately 75%. This observation encouraged
us to further analyze the mechanism of action of IPP51
because it appeared to be a potent selective inhibitor of
tumor-derived cell lines.

in HeLa cells (data not shown). Interference with mitotic
progression is often associated with perturbation of
microtubule dynamics. Therefore, we tested whether
IPP51 affects microtubule organization in dividing
cells by examining HeLa cells stably expressing GFPtubulin by videomicroscopy. Following the addition
of 10 µM IPP51, preformed bipolar spindles began
to dismantle, spindle microtubules shortened and the
spindle poles split into multiple asters. Compared to
control cells, IPP51-treated cells showed clear spindle
assembly defects and failed to proceed into anaphase
and cytokinesis (Supplementary Movies S1 and S2).
Similar aberrant spindles were observed in IPP51-treated
RT112 cells by immunofluorescence microscopy (Figure
2A). In the presence of IPP51, all mitotic spindles were
aberrant, as indicated by multiple short microtubule
asters, misaligned chromosomes and defects in DNA
congression to the metaphase plate. In contrast, untreated
cells had normal bipolar spindles with chromosomes
aligned to the metaphase plate (Figure 2A). Interestingly,
at the IPP51 concentration that induced aberrant spindles,
the interphase microtubule network appeared to be
unaffected compared to that of untreated cells (Figure
2B). Centrosomes, which are duplicated before mitosis,
control spindle organization and ensure spindle bipolarity

IPP51 disorganizes mitotic spindles
IPP51 was previously shown to induce an increase
in the proportion of RT112 cells arrested at the G2+M
phase of the cell cycle [19]. The same effect was observed

IPP51 treatment induces mitotic checkpoint
activation

during mitosis [45]. Among their components, γ-tubulin
is the most well-characterized and is known to promote
microtubule nucleation from the centrosomes [46]. As
expected, two spots of γ-tubulin were visualized in 95%
of mitotic cells in the control, leading to the formation of
normal bipolar spindles (Figure 2C). However, in presence
of IPP51, approximately 60% of mitotic cells showed
supernumerary microtubule organizing centers with three
or more γ-tubulin spots, leading to multiple spindle asters
(Figure 2C).

To determine the molecular changes caused by
IPP51 that are involved in cell cycle arrest during mitosis,
we analyzed the expression of cyclin B1, a key mitotic
regulator of cdk1 activity that accumulates progressively
during interphase before being degraded at the metaphase/
anaphase transition [47]. Western blotting of RT112 cell
lysates showed that the level of cyclin B1 was significantly

increased under IPP51 treatment (Figure 3A). This
accumulation of cyclin B1 was detected from 8 h after
the addition of IPP51 for both concentrations tested (5
µM and 10 µM), and 16 h after the addition of 10 µM
IPP51, cyclin B1 expression was two-fold greater than
that in untreated cells (Figure 3B). This effect was then
progressively attenuated, as the cyclin B1 expression
returned to its normal level after 24 h of treatment (Figure
3B).
BubR1 and Bub1 are protein kinases of the spindle
checkpoint complex that accumulate on kinetochores of
mitotic cells during pre-metaphase where they monitor
the proper microtubule kinetochore interactions; at

metaphase, their disappearance from the kinetochrores
triggers the transition from metaphase to anaphase [48,
49]. Visualization of BubR1 and Bub1 in mitotic HeLa
cells showed that BubR1 accumulates on chromosomes
during prometaphase but is no longer associated with
DNA at metaphase (Figure 3C). In contrast, some BubR1
spots were still visible in IPP51-treated cells arrested
at metaphase. Bub1 accumulation on kinetochores of
misaligned chromosomes in IPP51-treated cells arrested
at metaphase was much more obvious than that of BubR1
(Figure 3C). In contrast, in untreated cells (control) Bub1
was associated with chromosomes during prometaphase
but not metaphase.

IPP51 affects tubulin assembly in vitro and in
cellulo

4A). When IPP51 was added, the rate and overall extent of
tubulin assembly decreased in a dose-dependent manner.
The addition of 10 µM IPP51 resulted in 1.75 times
less polymerized tubulin than in the control. Although,
there was a progressive delay in the time of onset and a
progressive decrease in the initial rate of polymerization
with increasing concentrations of IPP51 (10-50 µM), the
plateau values for mass steady state were similar, but not
identical, for all concentrations. However, at 100 µM
IPP51, polymer mass was decreased by 89% compared to
the control. At each concentration, the initial bulk rate of
tubulin polymerization was calculated from the slope of

The above observation that IPP51 affects the cellular
organization of microtubules prompted us to examine
its possible effect on tubulin polymerization. Tubulin
assembly kinetics was studied using an in vitro turbidity
assay with purified tubulin in the presence or absence
of IPP51 [50]. The time course of turbidity variation
generated a sigmoid curve, with steady state being reached
at 40 minutes with our experimental conditions (Figure

equation. C. Upper. RT112 cells were incubated with nocodazole or IPP51 for 16 or 24 h. Fractions containing polymerized (pellet, P) and

the linear elongation phase, before microtubule polymer
mass steady state was reached, by linear regression. As
shown in Figure 4B, IPP51 inhibited microtubule bulk
elongation rates, with an IC50 of 4.89 µM.
To determine if this inhibitory effect of IPP51 on
tubulin polymerization could be detected in cellulo,
we quantified polymerized tubulin in cells by western
blotting. After incubation with IPP51 for 12 or 24 h,
cells were extracted with a microtubule-stabilizing buffer
to separate polymerized tubulin from free tubulin. As
expected, treatment of cells with nocodazole, a known
microtubule polymerization inhibitor, led to an increase in
the free tubulin fraction (Figure 4C). IPP51 had the same
effect, albeit to a lesser extent. Simultaneously, the free
tubulin fraction increased and the polymerized tubulin
fraction decreased in a time and concentration-dependent
manner. The relatively low effect of IPP51 on the level
of polymerized tubulin compared to that of nocodazole
is in agreement with the observation by indirect
immunofluorescence microscopy of no notable changes in
microtubule cytoskeleton organization in interphase cells
exposed to the same IPP51 concentrations as used in the
western blotting experiments (Figure 2B).
Altogether, our results strongly suggest that IPP51
binds directly to tubulin resulting in inhibition of its
polymerization both in vitro and in cellulo.

Cys241, and Leu242) and H8 (Leu248, Ala250, and
Leu255), whereas the aromatic moiety of IPP51 formed
hydrophobic interactions with Leu242 (H7), Ala316 and
Ala354 (S8-S10). No hydrogen bonds were observed
between IPP51 and the protein. MD simulation for 1 ns
confirmed the stability of the complex in explicit water
molecules, with a RMSD value of 0.9 +/- 0.2 for the ligand
atoms. Moreover, MM-GBSA thermodynamic calculations
confirmed a favorable binding mode for IP551, with a
ΔGMM-GBSA value of -37.2 +/- 1.8 kcal/mol.
The docking results predicted that IPP51 shares
the same tubulin binding site as colchicine. Affinityinduced fluorescence enhancement of colchicine with
tubulin (excitation, 362 nm; emission, 435 nm) has been
previously demonstrated [41]. To confirm that IPP51
interacts with the colchicine-binding site of tubulin in
vitro, we measured the fluorescence emission of the
colchicine-tubulin complex formed in the presence of
increasing concentrations of IPP51. Indeed, when tubulin
was added to the mixtures of colchicine and IPP51,
significant inhibition (close to 50%) of fluorescence
development occurred at IPP51 concentrations higher
than 10 µM (Figure 5C), suggesting that the IPP51 can
compete, albeit partially, with colchicine binding to
tubulin. These data confirmed our docking results and
led us to conclude that IPP51 interacts with tubulin at
the colchicine binding site, leading to an inhibition of
microtubule assembly.

IPP51 binds tubulin at the colchicine binding site

IPP51 exhibits anti-angiogenic properties

Numerous chalcone compounds that inhibit
the assembly of tubulin into microtubules bind to the
colchicine-binding site of tubulin [51]. Colchicine (Figure
5A) binding to tubulin causes tubulin to acquire a straight
structure, which prevents it from polymerizing into
microtubules. To determine whether IP551 can bind to the
colchicine-binding site of tubulin, a computational study
was performed. The crystallographic structure of tubulin
in complex with DAMA colchicine from Bos Taurus
(99% identity with human tubulin for which no X-ray
information is available, Supplementary Figure S1) was
used as a starting point for molecular docking calculations
[52]. Due to the hydrophobic properties of the colchicine
binding domain (lipophilic index of 11), a GOLD-MLP
approach was used for the molecular docking calculations
[39, 40]. Hydrophobicity was described by the molecular
lipophilicity potential (MLP), a molecular interaction
field that relies on an atomic fragmental system based on
1-octanol/water experimental partition coefficients. The
docking protocol was able to position the best-ranked
DAMA colchicine in the niche localized between the two
α and β tubulin subunits with a RMSD value of 1.0 Å with
respect to crystallographic information (Supplementary
Figure S2). Following this successful strategy, IPP51 was
docked in the colchicine binding site of β-tubulin (Figure
5B). The best ranked pose for the indol group of IPP51
was found to be trapped between helices H7 (Val238,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Recent studies have shown that most microtubulebinding agents have anti-angiogenic and/or vasculardisrupting activities [53]. Moreover, flavonoids and
chalcones have been shown to inhibit angiogenesis
through different mechanisms, such as regulation of
VEGF expression [54]. Thus, we evaluated the effect
of IPP51 on capillary-like tube formation by HUVECs
(human umbilical vein endothelial cells) plated on
Matrigel. In control conditions, after 5 h, we observed that
Matrigel provides a good environment for the organization
of endothelial cells into a network of tubes (Figure 6A).
When IPP51 was added at 5 or 10 µM at the time of cell
seeding, there was a strong inhibition of tube formation
(Figure 6A). Quantification of the characteristics of the
capillary-like network of HUVECs showed that IPP51
decreased both dimensions of that network (total area
covered by cells and total tube length) and its topology
in a concentration dependent manner (Figure 6B). This
indicated that IPP51 is a potent anti-angiogenic compound.

parental RT112 cells (Figure 7B). The calculated IC50 of
IPP51 for RT112-LUC cells was 4.1 ± 0.22 µM, which was
very close to that for RT112 parental cells (5 ± 0.31 µM).
These results justified the use of RT112-LUC cells instead
of RT112 parental cells for our in vivo experiments. Cells
were injected subcutaneously into the right flanks of nude
mice, and when tumors were palpable and detectable by
bioluminescence imaging, the animals were randomized
into two cohorts of four animals each: one group received
IPP51 and the other group received vehicle as a control
(1.5% DMSO in PBS). The treated mice received 50 µg
of IPP51 by intratumoral injection every two days for up
to twenty days. No signs of redness or inflammation were
observed at the IPP51 injection site. As shown in Figure

implant luciferase-transfected RT112 cells for this model,
which allowed us to directly monitor tumor development
by bioluminescence [55]. As a control, we first checked
whether the luciferase gene alone had a negative influence
on cell growth in vitro. The proliferative rates of the
RT112 parental cell line and a stably expressing luciferase
clone were assessed by MTT assay. As shown in Figure

of parental RT112 cells. Next, we examined whether IPP51
has the same cytotoxic effect against RT112-LUC cells and

noted that we were forced to sacrifice the animals at day
18 because the tumors had become too large. In contrast,
mice treated with IPP51 remained healthy without signs of
toxicity. The tumor growth of the IPP51-treated animals
was significantly inhibited; the tumors grew to only eight
times their starting volumes in the IPP51-treated animals
in comparison to thirty-two times their starting volumes
in the control-treated animals. After twenty days, the
tumor volume the IPP51-treated animals was 595 ± 146
mm3. The results were obtained by monitoring tumor
progression by traditional caliper measurement and were
confirmed by bioluminescent imaging (Figures 7D-7E).
At twenty days (sixteen days of treatment), the volume of
the IPP51-treated tumors was reduced by approximately
thirty-times that of the control group.
As IPP51 induced a significant reduction in tumor
volume, we searched to determine whether this was
accompanied by inhibition of cell proliferation and/or
apoptosis induction using tumor sections. Figures 8A
and 8B showed histological examination of H&E stained
sections obtained from tumors excised from control and
IPP51-treated mice. Several necrotic foci with pyknotic
and fragmented cell nuclei were observed in sections
derived from IPP51-injected tumors. This indicated that
IPP51 induced cell death. This was further assessed by
a TUNEL assay, which showed a significant number
of apoptotic nuclei in tumors from IPP51-treated mice
(Figures 8C-8D). The percentage of TUNEL-positive
cells increased from 11 ± 1% in the control group to 33 ±
5% in the IPP51-treated group (Figure 8K). As observed
in RT112 cells in culture, immunohistochemical analysis
of Ki-67, a cellular marker of cell proliferation [56],
confirmed that IPP51 injection resulted in a decrease in
cell proliferation of approximately 1.5-fold in the IPP51treated xenograft tumors compared to the vehicle-treated
xenograft tumors (Figures 8E-8F and 8L). We also
measured the mitotic index of RT112-tumor xenografts
to confirm the mechanism of action of IPP51 in vivo.
Immunostaining of phosphorylated histone H3 (Figures
8G-8H), a marker of mitotic chromosome condensation
[57], in sections from xenograft tumors showed an
increase in sections from IPP51-treated mice (~ 1.7-fold
greater than vehicle-treated mice, Figure 8M). It should
be noted that only a limited proportion of tumoral cells
expressed H3-phosphorylated histone or Ki-67 proteins.
This could be due to the proliferation rate paradox in
tumors [58]. In fact, low mitotic indices are frequently
observed in solid tumors, and it seems that cancer cells do
not proliferate quicker than normal cells but, rather, do so
in an untimely fashion. This led to the recent hypothesis
that microtubule-targeting agents could have effects on
cellular processes other than mitosis [59, 60]. Finally, we
examined whether IPP51 inhibits tumor angiogenesis.
Tumor sections were stained for CD31, a specific and
sensitive marker of endothelial cells. As shown in
Figures 8I-8J, IPP51 seemed to reduce the number of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

tumor blood vessels. Altogether, the results of our RT112
tumor xenograft experiments were consistent with those
previously observed in cultured cells, demonstrating that
IPP51 retained its activity in vivo.

IPP51, a chalcone derivative, was initially identified
as a potential anticancer agent that kills bladder cancer
cells through caspase-dependent apoptosis following cell
cycle arrest at the prometaphase stage. While inhibiting
proliferation of bladder and cervical cancer cells, IPP51
showed no toxicity against normal urothelial or lung cells,
which incited us to further characterize IPP51 and to
identify its cellular target(s). First, we observed that the
prometaphase arrest caused by IPP51 is associated with
aberrant mitotic spindles, accumulation of cyclin B1 and
activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint proteins.
These findings prompted us to investigate whether IPP51
targets tubulin. Our in vitro microtubule polymerization
assay suggested that IPP51 is a new inhibitor of
microtubule assembly. Furthermore, virtual docking of
the IPP51 to tubulin supported the observation that IPP51
competes with colchicine for the same tubulin binding site
in vitro. Finally, the putative chemotherapeutic potential of
IPP51 was confirmed by the observation of reduced tumor
growth in a mouse xenograft model.
IPP51 induced a mitotic block associated with
aberrant spindle formation and chromosome misalignment.
Live cell imaging of HeLa cells after they assembled
bipolar spindles demonstrated that the addition of IPP51
results in the disorganization of the bipolar mitotic spindle
due to spindle microtubules shortening and splitting
from the two spindle poles into multiple microtubule
asters with short microtubules. Treated bladder cancer
cells also appeared to have an increase in microtubule
organizing centers, which may be due to centrosome
splitting and/or the inheritance of aberrant centrosome
numbers following mitotic failure. Although centrosome
amplification is considered oncogenic in the absence of a
centrosome clustering mechanism, the increased number
of centrosomes leads to massive mitotic catastrophe and
inhibition of proliferation [61, 62].
Although the mechanisms by which inhibitors of
tubulin induce cell death vary depending on the particular
inhibitor and cell type, it seems clear that disruption of the
mitotic spindle activates the spindle-assembly checkpoint
(SAC), ultimately leading to apoptosis [63]. Indeed, IPP51
induced accumulation of the kinetochore-associated
checkpoint proteins Bub1 and BubR1 on the chromosomes
of HeLa cells. Their recruitment to the kinetochores has
been previously attributed to defects in the kinetochore
microtubule interaction and, in particular, in the lack
of tension generated by the forces exerted by dynamic
kinetochore-microtubules [64-66]. The presence of Bub1
and BubR1 in the kinetochores of treated cells suggests

protocol predicted that the indol group of IPP51 is
trapped between helices H7 (Val 238, Cys 241, and Leu
242) and H8 (Leu 248, Ala 250, and Leu 255), whereas
the aromatic moiety may be involved in hydrophobic
interactions with the Leu242 (H7), Ala 316 and Ala 354
(S8-S10) residues of β tubulin. No hydrogen bonds were
observed between IPP51 and the protein. Furthermore,
our in vitro competition assays for colchicine binding to
tubulin in the presence of IPP51 showed that IPP51 could
partially displace colchicine from tubulin, indicating that
IPP51 and colchicine target the same tubulin binding-site.
The failure of IPP51 to fully inhibit colchicine binding
to tubulin dimers may indicate differences in the tubulinligand binding reaction. Colchicine is known to bind to
the tubulin dimer through a biphasic reaction characterized
by the formation of a fast and reversible pre-equilibrium
complex followed by many conformational changes
in tubulin, which results in a poorly reversible tubulincolchicine complex (reviewed in [72]. The fact that IPP51
fails to fully displace colchicine at excess concentrations
relative to colchicine, may be due to the ability of IPP51
to only compete for the first pre-equilibrium tubulincolchicine complex (with a calculated IC50 of 7.29 µM)
and not for the second binding phase, which results in the
nearly irreversible final tubulin-colchicine complex.
Although colchicine was the first discovered tubulin
destabilizing agent that was able to inhibit mitosis, its
use as a chemotherapeutic agent is hampered by its low
therapeutic index due to its severe toxicity to normal
tissues [29]. However, it has been shown that drugs
targeting the colchicine-binding site on tubulin circumvent
class III β-tubulin resistance, which is one of major
limitations of the clinical use of microtubule-targeting
agents [73]. Therefore, IPP51 could have a clinical
advantage in tumors overexpressing the β III-tubulin
isoform.
Recently, tubulin binding agents received renewed
interest as anti-angiogenic drugs [2, 53]. Angiogenesis is
a key step in tumor progression and is a complex process
through which new blood vessels are formed from the preexisting vasculature [74]. The endothelial cell cytoskeleton
plays an essential role in this highly regulated process,
which may explain why microtubule-targeting agents show
anti-angiogenic properties. Indeed, we found that IPP51
inhibits capillary-like tube formation by HUVEC cells
embedded in Matrigel. Further studies would determine
how IPP51 interferes with the microtubule dynamics of
endothelial cells. We will also study if IPP51 can inhibit
endothelial cell proliferation or induce endothelial cell
apoptosis, which could be an advantage for disrupting
formed tumor blood vessels. Finally, our preliminary
studies on tumor xenografts indicated that IPP51
maintains its anti-angiogenic activity in vivo. However,
complementary studies will be necessary to quantify
this effect and to determine whether IPP51 affects tumor
vessel structure. In summary, this study identifies tubulin

aberrant kinetochore-microtubule dynamics and the loss of
tension between sister kinetochores. Thus, IPP51 induced
a sustained accumulation of the mitotic checkpoint
proteins Bub1 and BubR1 on misaligned chromosomes,
indicating that SAC activation occurred. This result is
consistent with the observed cyclin B1 accumulation and
mitotic arrest [67].
Microtubule dynamics are related to the intrinsic
tubulin polymerization properties and are regulated
by microtubule-associated proteins. In light scattering
experiments of MAP-free tubulin assembly, IPP51
inhibited the nucleation time and the bulk microtubule
elongation rate in a concentration-dependent manner.
The observed IC50 value of IPP51 in the microtubule
elongation phase of purified tubulin was approximately
5 µM, which coincided with our previous results that 5
µM IPP51 was sufficient to induce 50% loss of RT112
cell viability. Although the concentrations of the inhibitor
used in the current study were sufficient to provoke
obvious microtubule spindle defects, at interphase, the
microtubule cytoskeleton was not affected, and the
polymer mass was only slightly diminished. It is well
accepted that microtubules in interphase tissue culture
cells turnover slower than mitotic microtubules (reviewed
in [68, 69]. Therefore, mitotic microtubules may be more
prone to inhibition by IPP51 or by any other microtubuleinhibiting agent. On the other hand, recent studies have
shown that microtubule-targeting agents could have
effects on cellular processes other than mitosis [59, 60]. A
quantitative analysis of microtubule dynamics in cellulo
in the presence of the inhibitor would be valuable for
determining, in a more detailed mechanistic manner, the
inhibitory properties of IPP51 in interphase and mitotic
cells. The challenge now is to decipher which interphase
processes are more susceptible in tumor cells following
interphase-microtubule perturbations by IPP51 than
in normal cells. Such studies may explain the clinical
efficacy of anti-mitotic strategies, despite the fact that low
mitotic indices are observed in solid tumors.
Microtubule-targeting drugs are often classified
into two main groups, namely microtubule-stabilizing
agents and microtubule-destabilizing agents. The
second class of molecules often target the vinca, or
the colchicine-binding site, of tubulin [70]. These
molecules act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization and
inducing mitotic arrest, eventually leading to apoptosis.
Microtubule-depolymerizing agents induce spindle
formation defects, characterized by the formation of
paracrystalline microtubule arrays with vinca alkaloids
[71]. The effect of IPP51 on microtubule polymerization
and mitotic spindle formation most closely resembles that
of colchicine. Indeed, in silico modeling predicted that
the site of interaction of IPP51 with tubulin coincides
with the previously structurally characterized colchicine
binding site located at the interface between the α and β
monomers of the same heterodimer. Our virtual docking

as the molecular target of IPP51. This easily synthesized
chalcone derivative binds to the colchicine binding site
and inhibits tubulin polymerization both in vitro and in
vivo. IPP51 targets the mitotic spindle microtubules,
suggesting that its induction of apoptotic death can be
attributed to mitotic arrest caused by perturbation of
spindle assembly and activation of the spindle assembly
checkpoint. We have not yet analyzed whether the dead
cells were arrested in mitosis or in G1 after slippage from
mitosis. Nevertheless, our studies in a mouse model with
xenografts of human bladder tumor cells showed that
tumor shrinkage is associated with lower cell proliferation
linked to a higher mitotic index and apoptotic cell death
at IPP51 dosages of 50 µg every two days. Interestingly,
IPP51 exhibited significant reduction of tumor growth
with no signs of toxicity, which indicates that IPP51 has
chemotherapeutic potential. No drug currently approved
for clinical use targets the colchicine-binding site of
tubulin, suggesting that IPP51 is an interesting drug
candidate for further studies.

including for the docking studies.

Cell proliferation assay
Inhibition of cell proliferation was measured by a
MTT assay as previously described [20].

Indirect immunofluorescence
RT112 cells were plated on coverslips the day
before treatment with IPP51 for 16 h or 24 h. For
β-tubulin visualization, cells were fixed for 15 min in
4% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized for 10 min
with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. For γ-tubulin labeling,
fixation was performed in methanol at -20°C for 10 min.
After incubation with primary antibodies against tubulin
followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated
secondary antibodies, DNA was counterstained with
Hoechst (Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France).
Coverslips were mounted on glass slides using the
mounting liquid Fluorsave™ Reagent (Calbiochem,
Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Cells were observed
with an Axiovert 135 inverted microscope (Zeiss, Le Pecq,
France). Images were acquired using a black and white
XM10 camera (Olympus France SAS, Rungis, France)
and the Cell Sens software (Olympus).
For detection of Bub1 and BubR1 proteins, HeLa
cells were grown on poly-Dlysine-coated glass coverslips.
Cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde-PBS for 20
min, washed for 5 min with PBS, permeabilized with
0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 min, and washed again
for 5 min with PBS. Then, the cells were processed with
primary and secondary antibodies. DNA was detected with
DAPI in the VECTASHIELD mounting medium (Vector
Laboratories Inc, Burlingame, CA).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Antibodies against β-tubulin (clone TUB 2.1),
γ-tubulin and actin were purchased from Sigma (Lyon,
France). Rabbit anti-Bub1 and anti-BubR1 antibodies
were a kind gift from T. Yen (Fox Chase Cancer Institute,
Philadelphia). Cyclin B1 antibody was purchased from
Epitomics (Burlingame, USA). Antibodies against Ki-67
and Ser 10-phosphorylated histone H3 were purchased
from Abcam (Cambridge, UK) and Cell Signaling
Technology (Danvers, USA) respectively. Anti-CD31
antibody (clone MEC 13.3) was obtained from BD
Pharmingen (Le Pont de Claix, France). Antibody Alexa
Fluor 488 and 568-conjugated secondary antibodies were
obtained from Life Technologies (Paisley, UK).

Western blotting
Adherent and suspended cells were harvested,
washed twice with PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer
containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete, Roche,
Meylan, France). After 45 min on ice, the lysates were
centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 15 minutes, and soluble
proteins were quantitated using the QuantiPro BCA kit
(Sigma). Samples (50 µg of total protein) were resolved
by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose
membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat
dry milk, incubated overnight at 4°C with cyclin B1 or
actin antibodies and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit or
anti-mouse HRP-conjugated antibodies for 45 min at room
temperature. The membranes were developed with ECL
substrate (Perkin Elmer, Courtaboeuf, France).

Cell culture
Cells were cultured as described in Supplemental
Materials and Methods.

Chalcone synthesis
1-(2,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)-3-(1-methylindolyl)
propenone, namely IPP51 was prepared and characterized
according to our previous report [19]. It should be
highlighted that the IPP51 was obtained exclusively as the
E isomer as clearly and unambiguously determined by 1H
NMR. The Z isomer formation has never been observed.
Therefore, through all our study, the E isomer was used

Extraction of soluble and polymerized tubulin
fractions

described by Bhattacharyya and Wolff [41]. Excitation
was at 353 nm, and emission was read at 430 nm.
Measurements were performed at 37°C in a 1 x 1-cm
fluorescence cuvette under continuous stirring. Tubulin
(1 µM final concentration) was added to 5 µM colchicine
(from 2.5 M stock solution in DMSO) in the absence or
presence of increasing IPP51 concentrations. Changes
in the ratio of F/Fo, where F is the fluorescence of the
colchicine-tubulin complex formed in the presence of a
given IPP51 after 1 h and Fo is the fluorescence of an
equal concentration of colchicine in excess tubulin, were
plotted as a function of the inhibitor concentration. Data
points were fitted using GRAPHPAD PRISM 6 software.

Extraction was done using a modification of the
protocol described by Moon et al. [37]. After treatment
with drugs for 16 h or 24 h, medium containing cells
in suspension was recovered and pooled with adherent
cells scraped in PBS pre-warmed at 37°C. After
centrifugation 5 min at 400 x g and a wash with PBS,
cells were extracted for 5 min with pre-warmed at 37°C
microtubule-stabilizing buffer (0.1 M PIPES pH 6.9,
14.5% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mM EGTA and
5 mM MgCl2) containing Complete (protease inhibitor
cocktail from Roche) and 10 ng/ml paclitaxel (Sigma).
After centrifugation at 20 000 x g for 10 min at 25°C,
supernatants containing soluble fractions were transferred
to a new tube, while polymerized fractions in pellets were
recovered by incubation in RIPA buffer for 45 min on
ice followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 20 000 x g.
Twenty microliters of soluble and polymerized fractions
separately mixed with 4X Laemmli buffer were analyzed
by western blotting realized as mentioned above.

In vitro angiogenesis assay
An initial layer of Matrigel matrix (Corning,
Amsterdam, The Netherlands) of 150 µl per well in a
24-well plate was allowed to polymerize for 30 min at
37°C. Then, a second layer of 150 µl Matrigel per well
was applied and allowed to polymerize for 30 min at
37°C. The gel was overlaid with 8 x 104 HUVEC cells in
1 ml of complete medium containing a series of the same
concentrations of IPP51 or DMSO. After 5 h at 37°C,
phase contrast images were recorded and analyzed using
the automated WimTube image analysis tool (Wimasis
GmbH, Munich, Germany). Data were expressed as
percentages in comparison to cells treated with an equal
volume of vehicle alone (DMSO). All values presented
here are the means of two independent experiments. For
each well, 3 distinct fields of view were analyzed and
averaged.

Microtubule polymerization assays
Microtubule
polymerization
assays
were
performed in 96-well half-area µclear plates using a 96well photometer (TECAN) to measure absorbance at a
wavelength of 340 nm. All experiments were performed
at the same time using the same buffers and MAP-free
tubulin [38] from the same preparation to minimize
variations originating from different experimental
conditions. The final test volume was 50 L and was
prepared from solutions kept at 4 °C. The final tubulin
concentration was 20 µM in PEM buffer (100 mM PIPES,
1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, and 1 mM GTP), and tubulin
was supplemented with increasing concentrations of
inhibitor in DMSO; the DMSO concentration was adjusted
to be equal in all wells (10%). The polymerization of
microtubules was followed at 340 nm at 37°C. Data were
fitted using GRAPHPAD PRISM 6 software.

Tumor xenograft studies
All animal experiments were conducted in
adherence to the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care
(National Institutes of Health publication no 86-23, revised
1985) and approved by the regional ethics committee
(Reference number for animal experiments: 91_IAB-U823
MK-04; Comité d’éthique en experimentation animale de
Grenoble: Com-Eth, amended by the Comité National de
Réflexion Ethique sur l’Expérimentation animale (N°.12)).
Female athymic NMRI nude mice purchased from
Janvier (Le Genest Saint Isle, France) at 6 to 8 weeks
of age were maintained under specific pathogen-free
conditions. Xenografts were established by injecting 5
x 106 of luciferase-expressing cells subcutaneously into
the right flanks of the mice. On day 4, tumor size was
measured, the animals were randomized into 2 groups (n =
4 per group) and drug treatment was initiated. The control
group was treated with vehicle (1.5% DMSO in PBS). The
drug (or vehicle) treatment was performed for 20 days.
Tumor size was measured twice a week. The tumoral
volume was calculated as l2 x L x 0.52.

Molecular modeling
Docking calculations were carried out using GOLD
version 5.1 (CCDC, Cambridge, UK) and the MLP-filter
approach [39, 40]. Details of the docking studies are
described in Supplemental Materials and Methods.

Colchicine-tubulin binding competition assay
Fluorescence measurements of the binding of
colchicine to tubulin were performed with a MOS250 optical system (Bio-Logic S. A, Claix, France), as

Histological analyses
At the end of the in vivo experiment, the mice were
sacrificed, and the subcutaneous tumors were excised
and frozen. Frozen sections (8 µm) of the tumors were
made for further analysis. Hematoxylin / eosin staining
was performed as previously described [42]. For
immunostaining of proliferation and apoptosis markers,
frozen sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde,
permeabilized in PBS / 0.2% Triton-X100, and then
incubated with antibodies. Immunohistochemical staining
of CD31 was performed as previously described [43].
For quantification of apoptosis, TUNEL labeling was
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Roche).
