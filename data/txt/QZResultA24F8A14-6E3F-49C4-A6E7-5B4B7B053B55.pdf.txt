Abstract
The use of multikinase inhibitors (MKI) in oncology, such as
sorafenib, is associated with a cutaneous adverse event called
hand–foot skin reaction (HFSR), in which sites of pressure or
friction become inﬂamed and painful, thus signiﬁcantly
impacting quality of life. The pathogenesis of MKI-induced
HFSR is unknown, and the only available treatment options
involve dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy, which
have negative effects on primary disease management. To
investigate the underlying mechanisms by which sorafenib
promotes keratinocyte cytotoxicity and subsequent HFSR
induction, we performed a transporter-directed RNAi screen
in human epidermal keratinocytes and identiﬁed SLC22A20

(OAT6) as an uptake carrier of sorafenib. Further investigations
into the intracellular mechanism of sorafenib activity through
in situ kinome proﬁling identiﬁed the mitogen-activated protein kinase MAP3K7 (TAK1) as a target of sorafenib that induces
cell death. Finally, we demonstrate that sorafenib induced
keratinocyte injury in vivo and that this effect could be reversed
by cotreatment with the OAT6 inhibitor probenecid. Collectively, our ﬁndings reveal a novel pathway that regulates the
entry of some MKIs into keratinocytes and explains the basis
underlying sorafenib-induced skin toxicity, with important
implications for the therapeutic management of HFSR. Cancer

Introduction

myriad of mechanisms, leading ultimately to lack of efﬁcacy.
Moreover, although kinase inhibitors offer possibly a number of
important theoretical advantages over conventional cytotoxic
chemotherapy, they are still afﬂicted by some of the same problems, including an extensive interindividual pharmacokinetic
variability, the existence of a rather narrow therapeutic window,
and the occurrence of multiple, debilitating adverse events (1).
Cutaneous adverse effects are among the most frequently
observed toxicities with many kinase inhibitors, and their intensity can signiﬁcantly affect both quality of life and health care
economics (2). A particularly painful complication seen most
frequently during the early weeks of use with multikinase inhibitors (MKI), such as sorafenib, sunitinib, and pazopanib, is
called hand–foot skin reaction (HFSR), in which hyperkeratotic
plaques develop predominantly over sites of pressure or friction
(3, 4). These plaques may have signiﬁcant inﬂammation and
xerotic hyperkeratosis, often in a bilateral symmetric distribution,
causing pain and debilitation that interfere with activities of daily
living (2). Sequential biopsy specimens have revealed progressive
accumulation of hyperkeratosis with focal parakeratosis. The
clinical incidence of HFSR varies among MKIs with a particularly
high incidence being observed with sorafenib (Supplementary
Table S1; ref. 4), and does not appear to be related to increased
excretion of MKIs through sweat (5). The pathogenesis of MKIinduced HFSR remains currently unknown, and the only demonstrably effective treatment options involve dose reduction or
discontinuation of therapy, which have negative effects on disease
management (6, 7). Here, we provide evidence that sorafenib can
extensively accumulate into human epidermal keratinocytes
mediated by the organic anion transporter SLC22A20 (OAT6)

In oncology, the last two decades have seen a dramatic transition from the use of traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy to the
emergence of a new paradigm in rational drug design coupled
with an uprising in the development of targeted agents, including
the kinase inhibitors. To date, more than 20 different kinase
inhibitors have received approval by the FDA for the treatment
of a variety of diseases that were previously essentially resistant to
standard chemotherapy, and many more can be expected to
become available in the future (1). However, despite the success
of these agents in speciﬁc disease settings, many kinase inhibitors
face signiﬁcant challenges due to their susceptibility to de novo
resistance and/or the occurrence of acquired resistance through a

access to unlimited food and water. Wax depilation (Surgiwax)
was performed on the dorsal surface of anesthetized animals
according to the manufacturer's instructions, and mice were
randomly assigned a treatment group. The next day treatment
was initiated with twice daily oral administration of sorafenib
(60 mg/kg; formulated in 50% Cremophor EL and 50% ethanol,
then diluted 1:4 with deionized water), imatinib (100 mg/kg;
formulated in water), or vehicle and continued for 2 weeks.
Sorafenib (60 mg/kg) was also administered once daily with or
without probenecid (200 mg/kg; formulated in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose/0.1% Tween 80) given as an intraperitoneal
injection. At the end of treatment, mice were humanely euthanized and ﬁxed in 10% formalin. Blocks of skin tissue were
collected from the dorsal surface and sectioned into 4-mm-thick
sections. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and
hair follicle morphology was assessed in accordance with the
criteria outlined in Muller-Rover and colleagues (9). All procedures were approved by the St. Jude Animal Care and Use
Committee under protocol number 479-100245-07/13.
Plasma pharmacokinetic studies
Two separate sorafenib pharmacokinetic studies were performed in three to four C57BL6 mice following oral administration of sorafenib 60 mg/kg given with or without probenecid 100 mg/kg (i.p.). Serial blood samples were taken from
individual mice at 0.5 and 1 hour from the submandibular
vein, at 2 and 4 hours from the retro-orbital sinus, and at

6 hours by a terminal cardiac puncture. All blood samples were
centrifuged at 3,000  g for 5 minutes and plasma was stored
at 80 C until analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. The area under the
plasma concentration–time curve from time zero to 6 hours
after drug administration was estimated using WinNonlin
6.3 (Pharsight).
siRNA transfection
The MISSION Human Ion Channel and Transporter siRNA
library and siRNA-targeting A-RAF were purchased from SigmaAldrich. For the transporter screen, siRNA (set of three per gene)
were suspended in sterile water and pooled. Transient transfection
in HEKa cells was performed using Lipofectamine RNAiMax
according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies).
Brieﬂy, cells were plated in collagen-coated 96-well plates. The
next day the lipofectamine:siRNA (25 nmol/L) mixture was
prepared in OptiMEM media (Gibco) and then added to cells.
A sorafenib uptake assay was performed 48 hours later. SMARTpool siRNA was purchased from GE Life Sciences, and transfection
of HEKa cells in a 96-well or 12-well format was performed similar
to the method reported above.
In vitro transport assays
Cells were plated on 6-well, 12-well, or 96-well plates and
incubated with the indicated amount of [3H]-radiolabeled
drug for 5 to 60 minutes in phenol red-free EpiLife medium

without supplements at 37 C. The experiment was terminated
by placing the cells on ice and washing three times with icecold PBS. Cell were then lysed in 1 N NaOH and the solution
neutralized with 2 M HCl. Total protein was measured using a
Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc) and total
protein content was quantiﬁed using a Biotek mQuant microplate spectrophotometer. Intracellular drug accumulation was
determined in the remaining cell lysate by liquid scintillation
counting using a LS 6500 Multipurpose Scintillation Counter
(Beckman).
Kinome analyses
HEKa cells were exposed to DMSO or drug for 1 hour, washed
in PBS, and pelleted. Samples were analyzed by KiNativ in situ
proteomic proﬁling (ActivX Biosciences; refs. 10, 11). Kinase tree
was developed using TREEspot software. Inhibitor activity against
puriﬁed TAK1 was determined by KinaseProﬁler in vitro kinase
assay (Millipore).
Quantitative real-time PCR and microarrays
RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol reagent according to
the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was converted to cDNA
using the SuperScript III First Strand Kit (Life Technologies)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gene expression
was determined using Taqman primer/probes on a 7900HT
Sequence Detection System according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Microarray analysis was performed according to the
manufacturer's instructions.

In vitro antitumor efﬁcacy
Gene expression analyses in human tumors were performed
using the Pan Cancer gene expression dataset (9755 samples).
This dataset consists of RNA seq data from Illumina Hi-seq
analyses (12). The expression values were normalized across
cancer types, where the red color represents high gene expression
values, values in green represent low gene expression, and black
represents average expression. The information of interest was
extracted using the UCSC Xena browser (13). Expression of the
OAT6 gene SLC22A20 was further evaluated using real-time
RT-PCR in the lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549, the renal cell
carcinoma cell line 7860, the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line
HepG2, and the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line
CHRF288-11. The A549, 7860, and HepG2 cell lines were
obtained from ATCC; the CHRF288-11 cell line was a kind gift
from Dr. Tanja Gruber (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital).
The cell growth inhibitory potential of sorafenib (range: 0.1–100
mmol/L) in these cell lines was evaluated in the presence or
absence of probenecid (500 mmol/L) using an MTT assay following continuous exposure for 72 hours.
Statistical analyses
All data are presented as mean  SEM unless otherwise indicated. Prism (GraphPad) software was used for nonlinear
regression analysis of cell viability dose–response data and
Michaelis–Menten kinetics analysis. Statistical analysis was done
using a two-tailed Student t test using a cutoff for statistical
signiﬁcance of P < 0.05.

Multikinase Inhibitor-Induced Skin Toxicity

Identiﬁcation of OAT6 as a sorafenib transporter in
keratinocytes
Using primary human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKa) as a
model system (14), we observed that sorafenib causes a dosedependent decrease in viability [IC50 (mean  SEM) ¼ 0.83 
0.04 mmol/L and 0.99  0.05 mmol/L, lot 932013 and lot
1443683, respectively] and an increase in apoptosis (Fig. 1A and
B). In contrast, these cells were not sensitive to the Bcr-Abl
inhibitor imatinib, the clinical use of which is not associated
with HFSR (Supplementary Table S1). We hypothesized that
HFSR induction is due to extensive intracellular uptake of MKIs
in keratinocytes. In support of this hypothesis, we found that
sorafenib highly accumulates in HEKa compared with a panel
of other kinase inhibitors, including imatinib (Fig. 1C). The
sorafenib uptake process was concentration, time, and temperature dependent with a Michaelis–Menten constant (Km) of
7.0 mmol/L and a maximum velocity (Vmax) of 20,900 pmol/5
min/mg protein (Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1D). Similar to
sorafenib, the pharmacologically-active metabolite sorafenib
N-oxide also displayed a temperature- and time-dependent
transport in and cytotoxicity against HEKa (Supplementary Fig.
S1A and S1C–S1E).
Because sorafenib is a poorly permeable compound (15), we
next hypothesized that its uptake into keratinocytes is predominantly a transporter-mediated process. To explore this possibility
experimentally, we used the MISSION Human Ion Channel and
Transporter siRNA library in order to identify outer-membrane
localized transporter proteins in HEKa that, when silenced by a
short-interfering RNA, cause a decrease in the uptake of sorafenib.
In total, we screened 412 transporters in HEKa using an average
decrease in sorafenib uptake of 25% following gene silencing as
a cutoff for the identiﬁcation of candidate transporters for
further consideration (Supplementary Fig. S2A and Table
S2). This screen initially yielded 15 genes of putative importance (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S2B), although transcriptional proﬁling of HEKa indicated that 6 of these genes
(SLC6A18, SLC22A11, SLC25A31, SLC30A4, SLC32A1, and
SLC34A1) had very low expression levels (Supplementary Fig.
S2C). These six genes, and SLC35A2, which is known to encode
a transporter localized in the mitochondria (16), were excluded
from further consideration.
To identify the carrier that transports sorafenib into HEKa, we
measured sorafenib uptake in the presence of known inhibitors
for the eight remaining candidate transporters, namely SLC6A11,
SLC6A15, SLC6A19, SLC12A6, SLC22A20, SLC36A3, SLC38A1,
and SLC44A3. We found that the uptake process was particularly
sensitive to inhibitors of the family of organic anion transporters
(OATs; SLC22A), including probenecid (Fig. 1E). The sensitivity
of sorafenib uptake to the OAT inhibitors probenecid, hemicholinum-3 (HC3), and homovanillic acid (HVA) was further conﬁrmed in HEKa from a second lot (Fig. 1E). There are currently
seven known OATs with conﬁrmed sensitivity to probenecidmediated inhibition (17), and of these OAT6 showed the highest
mRNA expression in HEKa cells (Supplementary Fig. S2D). The
only known substrate for the OAT6 murine ortholog mOAT6 is
estrone-3-sulfate (18). Interestingly, OATP1B1, a hepatocellular
transporter of sorafenib (15), also transports estrone-3-sulfate,
suggesting a possible overlapping substrate speciﬁcity. Moreover,
SMARTpool siRNA-mediated knockdown of the OAT6 gene

www.aacrjournals.org

SLC22A20 in keratinocytes also reduced sorafenib uptake compared with control conditions (Fig. 1F). Taken together, these data
demonstrate that OAT6 is, at least in part, responsible for sorafenib uptake into HEKa.
Identiﬁcation of TAK1 as a sorafenib target in keratinocytes
At clinically achievable concentrations, many MKIs are not
selective for their intended target (19), and this ability to nonselectively inhibit kinases is thought to contribute to "off-target"
adverse events. In an effort to elucidate the intracellular mechanism of sorafenib-dependent keratinocyte cytotoxicity, we performed KiNativ in situ kinome analyses. Of note, this assay was
performed with intact cells and accounted for drug uptake
(Fig. 2A; ref. 10). A focused, sorafenib-target signature consisting
of 27 kinases was deﬁned by greater than 40% inhibition of
kinase-ATP binding following sorafenib treatment, and this list
of genes included the putative sorafenib target B-RAF (Fig. 2B;
ref. 20).
Using a clinically achievable concentration (3), sorafenib
kinase targets in HEKa were found to primarily cluster within
the tyrosine kinase, tyrosine kinase-like, STE, and GMGC subfamilies (Fig. 3A). To determine whether these kinases are important for cell survival, HEKa were transfected with SMARTpool or
MISSION siRNA followed by an assessment of cell viability. We
found that knockdown of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
MAP3K7 (TAK1) led to the greatest loss in cell viability (30 
5.5%, Z-score ¼ 3.6; Fig. 3B). We next performed KiNativ in situ

well as with dasatinib, a Bcr-Abl inhibitor that is not associated

at a clinically relevant inhibitor concentration, we found that 11
kinases were inhibited by sorafenib and sunitinib more strongly
as compared with dasatinib, including TAK1 (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table S3). Interestingly, previous reports have demonstrated that TAK1-deﬁcient keratinocytes show elevated basal
apoptosis and are hypersensitive to TNFa-induced cell death
(21, 22). Likewise, we observed a loss in cell viability and an
increase in cleaved caspase by transfecting cells with the deconstructed SMARTpool TAK1-targeting siRNA (Fig. 3C and D).

naling through MKK7/JNK (23), which was similar to the effects
observed with sorafenib (Fig. 4). Collectively, these ﬁndings
demonstrate that HEKa are sensitive to genetic and pharmacological inhibition of TAK1.
In agreement with our in vitro data, sorafenib was demonstrated to potently inhibit TAK1 kinase activity (IC50 ¼ 1.5
mmol/L; Fig. 3E). In addition, other MKIs associated with HFSR
were found to be active against TAK1 (IC50 range ¼ 0.16–1.3
mmol/L). In contrast, Bcr-Abl inhibitors did not inhibit TAK1
under the conditions tested, with the exception of dasatinib
(IC50 ¼ 51 mmol/L; Fig. 3E). However, at a clinically achievable
concentration (24), dasatinib displayed only low afﬁnity for
TAK1 in HEKa as assessed by in situ kinome proﬁling (Fig. 2B).
In addition, the MKI sunitinib, which potently inhibited TAK1

for TAK1 in situ (Fig. 2B). Both the in situ binding in keratinocytes and TAK1 kinase inhibition data are consistent with
publically available data for dissociation constants (Kd; Supplementary Fig. S3B; ref. 19), and further suggest that the
targeting of TAK1 may underlie the propensity of certain MKIs
to cause HFSR.
Sorafenib-mediated keratinocyte toxicity in vivo
Recent studies have uncovered a role for TAK1 in the maintenance of keratinocyte homeostasis, with the most compelling
evidence coming from mice with an epidermis-speciﬁc TAK1
deﬁciency. These mice display a phenotype characterized by
hard, inﬂexible skin with widespread scaling (25). Likewise,
inducible deletion of epidermal TAK1 in mice shows a phenotype of hyperkeratotic, scaling skin, the histopathology of
which is similar to that observed in patients experiencing
MKI-mediated HFSR (22). Moreover, TAK1-deﬁcient mice
show reduced hair follicle morphogenesis and hair follicle
regrowth after depilation (26).
Similar to our observations in HEKa in vitro, we observed that
mouse primary epithelial keratinocytes (MPEK) are sensitive to

www.aacrjournals.org

sorafenib-induced cell death with an IC50 similar to that observed
in HEKa [IC50 (mean  SEM): 2.2  0.02 and 1.5  0.05 mmol/L,
MPEK-129 and MPEK-BL6 cells, respectively; Fig. 5A]. MPEK
accumulate sorafenib to a similar extent compared with HEKa,
and through a mechanism that is sensitive to probenecid (Fig. 5B
and C). We next tested whether sorafenib can induce keratinocyte
injury in vivo by determining its effects on hair follicle growth in
mice after depilation. The hair follicle is a specialized mini-organ
that is critically dependent on programmed keratinocyte differentiation (27, 28), and disruption of hair follicle cycling or
morphology is indicative of keratinocyte toxicity. We hypothesized that this could be a useful model for MKI-induced HFSR
because immunostaining of biopsies from patients receiving
sorafenib has shown loss of cytokeratin 10 (CK10) and increased
cytokeratin 14 (CK14) expression, suggesting an effect on keratinocyte differentiation. Wax depilation of the dorsal hair of
C57Bl6 mice was performed to stimulate and synchronize hair
follicle growth. Mice were then administered sorafenib or imatinib under treatment schedules that produce a clinically relevant
drug exposure (29, 30). One week after depilation, hair growth
was delayed in sorafenib-treated animals, and at two weeks hair

was less dense and lacked pigmentation in sorafenib-treated
animals compared with control animals (Fig. 5D). In contrast to
sorafenib, hair growth and pigmentation in imatinib-treated
animals was similar to that of vehicle-treated animals (Fig.
5D). Histologic assessment revealed that the skin of sorafenibtreated mice contained hair follicles that had reduced melanin
and a gross disruption in morphology, including a reduced hair
bulb diameter and enlarged outer root sheath, compared with the
skin of vehicle- or imatinib-treated mice (Fig. 5E). However,
under the applied conditions, no differences in the keratin and
granular cell layers were observed in each of the three treatment
groups (Supplementary Fig. S4). Both of these layers were
increased in thickness in areas of skin with active hair growth
(anagen), but the granular layer was absent in all inactive areas
(telogen). Currently ongoing studies are focused on more prolonged treatment regimens to conﬁrm the presence of such
phenotypes.
To test whether inhibition of OAT6 can prevent the effects of
sorafenib on hair follicle regrowth and morphology in vivo,
depilated mice were treated with sorafenib and probenecid, and
this cotreatment reversed the effects of sorafenib on hair follicle
regrowth (Fig. 5F). Both hair follicle pigmentation and hair
follicle morphology in mice that received sorafenib in combination with probenecid were similar to vehicle-treated mice (Fig.
5G). Pharmacokinetic studies were performed following administration of sorafenib with or without probenecid to ensure that
probenecid did not alter the concentrations of sorafenib in
plasma. The area under the plasma concentration–time curve
(mean  SEM) of sorafenib was 32.5  10.9 mgh/mL following
single-agent sorafenib administration and 33.0  17.0 mgh/mL
when sorafenib was coadministered with probenecid. This ﬁnding indicates that the observed toxicity phenotypes are not the
result of a reduced systemic exposure of sorafenib caused by
probenecid.

Probenecid as adjunct therapy during sorafenib treatment
Combining sorafenib with OAT6 inhibitors such as probenecid could possibly reduce the incidence and severity of HFSR
during anticancer therapy. However, it is important to establish
that the anticancer efﬁcacy of sorafenib is not reduced by
probenecid. The success of such a combination therapy would
most likely depend on two crucial factors, namely dosing/
scheduling strategy and expression status of OAT6 in cancer
cells. To gain preliminary insights, we ﬁrst evaluated the OAT6
gene expression proﬁle in 9755 human tumor specimens using
normalized RNAseq data from 31 individual cancer cohorts
from The Cancer Genome Atlas. This analysis indicated that
OAT6 is expressed at low or undetectable levels in samples
associated with the main sorafenib indications, namely renal
cell, hepatocellular, and thyroid carcinomas (Fig. 6A), whereas
OAT6 is detectable in the majority of samples only in a single
disease type, namely AML (Fig. 6A). A similar OAT6 expression
pattern was observed in replicating cell lines representative of
lung adenocarcinoma (A549), renal cell carcinoma (7860),
hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), and AML (CHRF28811; Fig. 6B), although in each cell line the expression was
substantially lower than that observed in HEKa (Fig. 6B). Most
importantly, in vitro experiments where cells were treated with
the combination sorafenib–probenecid followed by MTT
assays at 72 hours indicated that probenecid did not antagonize
the cytotoxic effects of sorafenib under these conditions (Fig.
6C–G). This ﬁnding suggests that sorafenib can be taken up
into cancer cells by one or more distinct carriers independently
of OAT6, and that these presently unknown carriers are insensitive to probenecid-mediated inhibition. Although in vivo
conﬁrmation is required, these initial observations suggest that
combining sorafenib with OAT6 inhibitors has the potential to
reduce toxicities without compromising anticancer effects on
tumor cells.

Multikinase Inhibitor-Induced Skin Toxicity

In summary, we identiﬁed OAT6 as a transporter regulating
the uptake of sorafenib in keratinocytes, which resulted in cytotoxicity in vitro by a TAK1-dependent mechanism (Fig. 7). In vivo,
sorafenib-dependent keratinocyte toxicity was observed as
reduced hair follicle regrowth, loss of hair pigmentation, and
altered hair follicle morphology. These ﬁndings not only shed
light on the etiology of sorafenib-induced skin toxicity, but
provide a rationale for the future development of new targeted
interventions using transporter inhibitors to mitigate a debilitating side effect associated with MKIs.
