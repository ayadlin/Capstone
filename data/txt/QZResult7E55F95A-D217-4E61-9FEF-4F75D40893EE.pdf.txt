Abstract

HHMI Author Manuscript

Oncogenic mutations in the small GTPase Ras are highly prevalent in cancer, but an understanding
of the vulnerabilities of these cancers is lacking. We undertook a genome-wide RNAi screen to
identify synthetic lethal interactions with the KRAS oncogene. We discovered a diverse set of
proteins whose depletion selectively impaired the viability of Ras mutant cells. Among these we
observed a strong enrichment for genes with mitotic functions. We describe a pathway involving the
mitotic kinase PLK1, the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome and the proteasome that, when
inhibited, results in prometaphase accumulation and the subsequent death of Ras mutant cells. Gene
expression analysis indicates that reduced expression of genes in this pathway correlates with
increased survival of patients bearing tumors with a Ras transcriptional signature. Our results suggest
a previously underappreciated role for Ras in mitotic progression and demonstrate a
pharmacologically tractable pathway for the potential treatment of cancers harboring Ras mutations.

INTRODUCTION
A major challenge in cancer therapeutics is the identification of cellular drug targets whose
inhibition leads to the selective killing of cancer cells while sparing normal cells. Recent
advances in mammalian RNA interference (RNAi) technologies have made it possible to
systematically interrogate the human genome for genes whose loss of function constitute
synthetic lethality either with the oncogenic state or with particular oncogenic mutations (Ngo

lentiviral-based short hairpin RNA (shRNA) libraries targeting the entire human genome to
enable genome-wide loss-of-function analysis through stable gene knockdown (Silva et al.,
2005). Our design also allowed us to develop a multiplex screening platform that enables the
highly parallel screening of >10,000 shRNAs in a pool-based format using microarray
deconvolution (Schlabach et al., 2008; Silva et al., 2008). These technological breakthroughs
have made it possible to rapidly interrogate the genome for functional vulnerability of cancer
cells and here we apply these to the Ras oncogene.

HHMI Author Manuscript

The Ras family of small GTPases are frequently mutated in human cancers [Reviewed in
(Karnoub and Weinberg, 2008)]. Ras is a membrane-bound signaling molecule that cycles
between the inactive, GDP-bound state and the active, GTP-bound state. Growth factor
receptor signaling promotes GTP loading and activation of Ras, which in turn activates an array
of downstream pathways to promote cell proliferation and survival. Among the major Ras
effector pathways is the MAP kinase pathway, the PI3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, RalGDS
proteins, phospholipase-Cε and Rac. Each of these has been implicated in mediation of Ras
oncogenesis. Ras GAPs (GTPase activating proteins) inactivate Ras by stimulating GTP
hydrolysis. Oncogenic mutations in Ras are invariably point mutations that either interfere with
Ras GAP binding or directly disrupt Ras GTPase activity, locking Ras in a constitutively active,
GTP-bound state. Oncogenic mutations have been found in all three members of the Ras gene
family with KRAS being the most frequently mutated. KRAS mutations are found at high
frequencies in pancreatic, thyroid, colon, lung and liver cancers and in myelodyspastic
syndrome and are correlated with poor prognosis (Karnoub and Weinberg, 2008).
Despite its prominent status as a cancer drug target, therapeutics aimed at disrupting the Ras
pathway have proven challenging thus far. Inhibitors of farnesyl transferase, the enzyme that
prenylates Ras for its membrane localization, have met with only limited success (Karnoub
and Weinberg, 2008). Chemical screens in isogenic Ras mutant and wild type cell lines have
identified compounds that exhibit preferential toxicity towards Ras mutant cells (Torrance et
al., 2001; Dolma et al., 2003). However, the translation of these chemical screens into clinical
practice has been impeded by the challenge in identifying the protein targets of these chemical
entities and subsequent drug development. Inhibitors targeting various Ras effecter pathways
could also prove efficacious in treating tumors with Ras mutations, as it was recently shown
that a combined application of MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors can reduce tumor burden in
a mouse model of Ras-driven lung cancer (Engelman et al., 2008). However, the prevalence
of de novo and acquired drug resistance to other targeted therapies suggests that combinations
of multiple therapeutic agents will be required to effectively inhibit malignant progression.

HHMI Author Manuscript

In principle, tumors can be attacked by either reversing the effects of oncoproteins through
inhibition (i.e. exploiting oncogene addiction), or by attacking tumor-specific vulnerabilities
caused by the oncogenic state, often by inhibiting proteins that are not oncoproteins themselves
(i.e. exploiting non-oncogene addiction) (Solimini et al., 2008;Luo et al., 2009). The
inappropriate rewiring of cellular signaling through oncogene activation should result in
vulnerabilities that could be exploited for cancer therapies in theory. Since these vulnerabilities
are not obvious and cannot be predicted, the most direct approach to their discovery is through
genetic exploration. The systematic identification of genes and pathways necessary for the Rasdriven oncogenic state would provide additional drug targets for therapeutic exploration, shed
new light on Ras’ mechanisms of action and potentially provide new biomarkers for patient
stratification. To this end, we screened our shRNA library for genes whose inhibition
constitutes synthetic lethality with the KRAS oncogene. We identified a functionally diverse
set of genes including a number of mitotic proteins and demonstrate that pharmacological
inhibitors targeting these mitotic proteins can selectively impair the viability of Ras mutant
cells. These findings point to a previously underappreciated role of Ras in mitotic progression

and demonstrate that mitotic stress induced by the Ras oncogene might be exploited for
therapeutic purposes.

RESULTS
Genome-wide RNAi synthetic lethal screen against the KRAS oncogene
We chose the colorectal cancer cell line DLD-1 for the primary screen (Figure 1A). These cells
carry an endogenous activating K-Ras G13D point mutation required for maintaining their
oncogenic state (Shirasawa et al., 1993; Torrance et al., 2001). An isogenic clone of DLD-1
cells with the KRASG13D allele disrupted shows decreased MAP kinase signaling, reduced
proliferation on adherent surfaces and is no longer able to sustain anchorage-independent
growth in vitro (Figure 1 B-D) or tumor growth in vivo. Thus, they clearly exhibit addiction
to the KRAS oncogene and their malignant phenotype critically depends on mutant K-Ras
function.

HHMI Author Manuscript

We screened the parental KRAS WT/G13D (Ras Mut) DLD-1 cells and the isogenic
KRAS WT/− (Ras WT) DLD-1 control cells with our library of 74,905 retroviral shRNAs
targeting 32,293 unique human transcripts (including 19,542 RefSeq transcripts). The library
was screened in 6 pools of ∼13,000 shRNAs per pool using a protocol described previously
(Figure 1A) (Schlabach et al., 2008). We analyzed the change in relative abundance of each
shRNA over time by microarray hybridization to identify those that are anti-proliferative and
are thus depleted from the population. We compared the lethality signature of the Ras Mut and
WT cells to identify those shRNAs showing selective depletion in the Ras Mut but not Ras
WT cells. Such shRNAs are potential Ras synthetic lethal (RSL) candidates. Relaxed statistical
criteria identified 1,741 RSL shRNAs targeting 1,613 genes, whereas a more stringent cutoff
identified a subset 379 RSL shRNAs targeting 368 genes (Table S1 and Table S2).

HHMI Author Manuscript

We devised a multicolor competition assay (MCA) to test the reproducibility of candidate RSL
shRNAs from the primary screen (Smogorzewska et al., 2007). Individual shRNAs were
packaged into retroviruses and infected into a 50:50 mixture of GFP+ DLD-1 Ras Mut cells
and GFP− (colorless) DLD-1 Ras WT cells. The relative ratio of Ras Mut versus WT cells at
∼7 days post shRNA infection was analyzed by FACS and compared to that of the same cells
infected with a negative control shRNA targeting luciferase (Figure 1E). Using this assay we
tested 320 candidate RSL shRNAs from the primary screen and found 83 shRNA (26%)
targeting 77 genes to preferentially decrease the fitness of Ras Mut cells compared to Ras WT
cells (Table S3). To rule out cell-line specific effects, we performed MCAs in a second isogenic
pair of colorectal cancer cell lines: HCT116 KRAS WT/G13D and HCT116 KRAS WT/−, which
were derived in the same manner as the DLD-1 isogenic pair (Shirasawa et al., 1993; Torrance
et al., 2001). Many shRNAs that scored in the DLD-1 cells also showed synthetic lethality in
the HCT116 cells (50 of 68 tested, 73.5%, Table S3), indicating the majority of candidate RSL
shRNAs are likely to interact genetically with KRAS.
Functional diversity of candidate RSL genes
We recovered shRNAs against KRAS itself from the screen. In accordance with the phenotype
of the Ras WT isogenic controls, shRNA-mediated knockdown of K-Ras expression (both Mut
and WT protein) in both DLD-1 and HCT116 cells resulted only in modest decrease in growth
on adhesive surfaces but severely impaired colony formation in soft-agarose (Figure S1), thus
confirming the inhibition of K-Ras to be sufficient for suppressing the malignant phenotype
of these cells. Both the MAP kinase and PI 3-kinase pathways have been implicated in Rasdriven oncogenesis, However, we recovered few genes in these pathways and the MEK
inhibitor U0126 and PI3K inhibitor LY294002 did not cause selective toxicity towards Ras

Mut cells compared to Ras WT cells, indicating that inhibiting MEK or PI3K alone in these
cells are not sufficient to constitute synthetic lethality (Figure S1) (Haigis et al., 2008).

HHMI Author Manuscript

The list of candidate RSL genes is functionally diverse (Figure 2A and Table S3). Using
PANTHER (Thomas et al., 2003), we identified several biological processes including protein
modification, nucleic acid metabolism, cell cycle and signal transduction to be enriched in our
screen. We also identified a number of pathways upon which Ras Mut cells are more dependent.
For example, we identified shRNAs against genes in ribosomal biogenesis and translation
control (BXDC2, FBL, NOL5A, EIF3S8, EIF3S4, GSPT1, HNRNPC and METAP1), in protein
neddylation (COPS3, COPS4, COPS8, NEDD8, NAE1/APPBP1) and sumoylation pathways
(SAE1, UBA2 and UBE2I) and in RNA splicing (FIP1L1, NXF1, USP39, DHX8 and
THOC1). While many of these are essential genes under circumstances of complete depletion,
we have found that partially reducing their activity leads to enhanced growth defects in Ras
Mut cells. To rule out off-target effects, we tested multiple shRNAs against several of these
genes, and in the majority of cases we were able to identify additional shRNAs that give the
same phenotype (Figure 2B).

HHMI Author Manuscript

These findings suggest that Ras requires additional support from many genes to maintain the
oncogenic state. For example, we identified the RNA processing/export factor THOC1, a
member of the TREX mRNA transport complex, to be synthetically lethal with Ras (Figure
2B). THOC1 was recently shown to be selectively required for the Ras-driven proliferation
and transformation of murine fibroblasts (Li et al., 2007). We also identified several subunits
of the COP9 signalosome (Cope and Deshaies, 2003), which regulates the activity of SCF
ubiquitin ligases as RSLs. Depleting either COPS3 or COPS4 impaired the fitness of Ras Mut
cells relative to Ras WT cells in the competition assay (Figure 2). Furthermore, DLD-1 Ras
Mut cells with stable depletion of COPS4 exhibit both impaired growth on adherent surfaces
and in soft agar (Figure S2).
Ras mutant cells are sensitive to mitotic perturbations
Strikingly, we identified a number of genes involved in the regulation of mitosis as RSL genes.
Among these are cyclin A2 (CCNA2), hMis18α and hMis18 β (C21ORF45 and OIP5), borealin
(CDCA8), KNL-1 (CASC5), MCAK (KIF2C), subunits of the APC/C complex (ANAPC1,
ANAPC4, CDC16 and CDC27), SMC4 and the mitotic kinase PLK1 (Table S1 and Table S3).
Their depletion phenotypes are likely to be on-target effects as multiple shRNAs gave similar
results (Figure 3A and Figure S3A).

HHMI Author Manuscript

The identification of many mitotic genes as RSL candidates suggest that Ras Mut cells might
experience heightened mitotic stress. Indeed, despite having a modestly faster doubling time
(Figure 1C) and a similar percentage of G2 cells relative to Ras WT cells (26.1±3.3 vs. 26.7
±4.5), DLD-1 Ras Mut cells show a 50% higher mitotic index, indicative of slower mitotic
progression (Figure 3B). Furthermore, when released from a mitotic block induced by the Eg5
kinesin inhibitor monastrol (Mayer et al., 1999), a significantly higher fraction of Ras Mut cells
exhibit lagging chromosome in anaphase (Figure 3C). To further explore the consequences of
mitotic stress pharmacologically we examined the sensitivity of the Ras Mut and WT cells
towards two inhibitors of mitotic spindle function, nocodazole and paclitaxel (Peterson and
Mitchison, 2002). Whereas both the Ras Mut and WT cells show comparable sensitivity to the
microtubule depolymerizer nocodazole (Figure S3B), both DLD-1 and HCT116 Ras Mut cells
show increased sensitivity to the microtubule stabilizer paclitaxel relative to their respective
WT counterparts (Figure 3D and Figure S3C). Cell cycle analysis reveals that, at the synthetic
lethal concentration, paclitaxel causes a strong G2/M arrest in Ras Mut cells but not in Ras
WT cells that is attributed to a striking pro-metaphase block in the Ras Mut cells (Figure 3E
and F). Together these findings indicate that the Ras oncogene causes increased mitotic stress
and renders the cell hypersensitive to perturbation of the mitotic machinery.

Ras mutant cells are hypersensitive to inhibition of PLK1 function

HHMI Author Manuscript

Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) plays a key role in mitosis (Barr et al., 2004; Petronczki et al.,
2008). Its activity is often deregulated in cancer cells and inhibitors against PLK1 have been
developed as potential cancer therapeutics (Strebhardt and Ullrich, 2006). We discovered that
multiple shRNAs against PLK1 show increased toxicity towards Ras Mut cells compared to
Ras WT cells in both DLD-1 and HCT116 isogenic pairs (Figure 4A, Figure S4A).
Furthermore, siRNAs against PLK1 also yielded enhanced toxicity towards Ras Mut cells
(Figure S4B).
To further confirm this, we tested the effect of BI-2536, a highly selective small molecule
inhibitor of PLK1 (Steegmaier et al., 2007). We observed increased sensitivity of Ras Mut cells
towards BI-2536 in both DLD-1 and HCT116 isogenic pairs (Figure 4B, Figure S4C), with
the strongest effect found at 25 nM in DLD-1 cells. We next analyzed cell cycle distribution
of DLD-1 cells after treatment with either 25 nM or 50 nM of BI-2536 for 24h. Whereas the
cell cycle profile of Ras WT cells is only modestly affected, Ras Mut cells show a profound
G2/M accumulation in the presence of BI-2536 (Figure 4C). Microscopy analysis revealed the
G2/M accumulation in Ras Mut cells is due to a strong block in prometaphase: whereas a
substantial number of metaphase and anaphase cells could still be found among Ras WT cells
in the presence of BI-2536, few such cells were found among Ras Mut cells (Figure 4D and
Figure S4D).

HHMI Author Manuscript

PLK1 functions at multiple stages during mitosis (Petronczki et al., 2008). To investigate
whether PLK1 inhibition delays mitotic entry in DLD-1 Ras Mut cells, we synchronized cells
at the G2/M boundary using the CDK1 inhibitor RO-3306 (Vassilev et al., 2006) and released
them with or without the presence of BI-2536 into nocodazole to trap mitotic cells. Mitotic
entry was faster for Ras Mut cells but was unaffected by BI-2536 in either Ras WT or Ras Mut
cells (Figure 4E and Figure S4E). We next released mitotic cells synchronized in nocodazole
and tested their ability to complete mitosis in the presence of BI-2536. Whereas BI-2536 had
minimal effect on Ras WT cells in this respect, it caused a profound delay in mitotic exit in
Ras Mut cells (Figure 4F and Figure S4F). This finding further supports the notion that Ras
Mut cells are more dependent upon PLK1 for mitotic progression. The mitotic arrest of Ras
Mut cells in BI-2536, however, was not sustained over time. Prolonged treatment with BI-2536
for 48h results in an elevated sub-G1 population in Ras Mut cells, indicative of cell death
(Figure 4G and Figure S4G).

HHMI Author Manuscript

PLK1 is transcriptionally upregulated in late S and in G2 phase, whereas its catalytic activation
requires phosphorylation at Thr210 by the kinase Aurora-A at the G2/M transition (Seki et al.,
2008; Macurek et al., 2008). A simple explanation of our results would be if Ras Mut cells had
lower PLK1 protein levels or activity during mitosis. However, the levels of both total and
activated PLK1 protein are actually slightly elevated in Ras Mut cells during mitosis,
particularly at G2/M (Figure S4H). Together our findings suggest that activated Ras adversely
affects mitotic progression and renders cells more dependent on PLK1 activity for proper
mitosis progression.
Ras mutant cells are hypersensitive to APC/C and proteasome inhibition
Mitotic progression is controlled by the activity of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome
(APC/C), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes the orderly degradation of key mitotic proteins
(Peters, 2006). Several APC/C subunits including APC1/ANAPC1, APC4/ANAPC4, Cdc16
and Cdc27 scored in our screen (Table S1 and Table S3, Figure 5A), suggesting that Ras Mut
cells are more dependent on APC/C activity for mitotic progression. The activity of APC/C is
inhibited by EMI1 prior to mitosis, until PLK1 phosphorylates EMI1 and targets it for
degradation via the SCF-βTRCP E3 ligase (Reimann et al., 2001; Hansen et al., 2004). The

binding partner of EMI1, EVI5, on the other hand, blocks PLK1 phosphorylation of EMI1 and
thereby antagonizes APC/C activation (Eldridge et al., 2006). Thus if Ras Mut cells are more
dependent on APC/C activity, they might also be more sensitive to EMI1 or EVI5
overexpression. This is indeed the case. When we lentivirally over-expressed exogenous EMI1
and EVI5 in these cells, the viability of Ras Mut cells was specifically impaired (Figure 5B).
Our results suggest that either APC activation might be reduced in Ras Mut cells or that these
cells show a higher dependence on normal APC/C activity for survival. Consistent with these
models, sub-phenotypic siRNA knockdown of APC subunits strongly synergizes with subphenotypic low concentrations of BI-2536 to confer synthetic lethality in DLD-1 Ras Mut cells
(Figure 5C).

HHMI Author Manuscript

Two steps in the central pathway identified in our screen require proteolysis. Both activation
of the APC/C through EMI1 ubiquitination and APC/C targeted ubiquitination of mitotic
proteins ultimately require proteasome activity for degradation. Importantly, our screen also
identified shRNAs against several proteasome subunits including PSMA5, PSMB5 and
PSMB6 (Figure 5D). Furthermore, two structurally distinct small molecule inhibitors of the
proteasome, MG132 and bortezomib (Velcade), both exhibit synthetic lethality with Ras Mut
cells (Figure 5E and Figure S5A). Consistent with the model that the hypersensitivity of Ras
Mut cells to proteasome inhibition is in part due to mitotic defects, Ras Mut cells are more
sensitive to MG132- and bortezomib-induced G2/M arrest (Figure 5F and Figure S5B), again
due to a profound prometaphase block (Figure 5G). Interestingly, we found that DLD-1 Ras
Mut cells have higher levels of cyclin B1, a key mitotic cyclin that must be degraded by the
APC/C during metaphase-anaphase transition (Figure S5C). Together these results suggest that
the Ras oncogene causes a heightened dependency on the APC and renders cells sensitive to
further inhibition of this complex.
Mitotic inhibitors attenuate tumor xenograft growth in vivo
To assess whether targeting the mitotic machinery could inhibit the growth of DLD-1 and
HCT116 cells in vivo using mouse xenograft models, we treated nude mice bearing
subcutaneous DLD-1 or HCT116 tumors with the PLK1 inhibitor BI-2536. In both cases we
found tumor growth to be significantly attenuated in animals treated with BI-2536 (Figure 6A
and 6B). In agreement with their in vitro sensitivity, we find HCT116 tumors to be more
sensitive to BI-2536 compared to DLD-1 tumors.
The mitotic machinery as an Achilles’ heel for Ras mutant cancer cells

HHMI Author Manuscript

Taken together, our results suggest that cancer cells with mutant Ras experience elevated
mitotic stress and are more dependent on key mitotic proteins such as PLK1, the APC complex,
the COP9 signelosome and the proteasome for proper mitotic progression (Figure 6C), and we
showed that targeting selected mitotic proteins could exacerbate this mitotic stress to
selectively kill Ras mutant cancer cells. We have shown that small molecule inhibitors that
disrupt mitosis, including paclitaxel, BI-2536, bortezomb (Velcade) and MG132, all constitute
synthetic lethality with Ras mutant cells. Strikingly, transient treatment of DLD-1 cells for 24
hours with these drugs, which approximates the length of one cell cycle for these cells, is
sufficient to selectively impair the viability of Ras Mut cells (Figure S6). This indicates that
many Ras Mut cells might not recover from their drug-induced mitotic arrest and fail to
complete normal mitosis following the inhibitor removal.
To assess whether this mitotic stress might also be associated with other oncogenes, we tested
potential synthetic lethal interactions between paclitaxel, BI-2536, bortezomib or MG132 and
the PIK3CA oncogene. DLD-1 and HCT116 cells also harbor oncogenic mutations in
PIK3CA encoding the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K. Isogenic DLD-1 and HCT116 cell lines
in which the PIK3A oncogene has been deleted by homologous recombination have been

generated (Samuels et al., 2005). In contrast to Ras Mut DLD-1 cells, PI3K Mut DLD-1 cells
are more resistant to these inhibitors compared to PIK3CA WT DLD-1 cells. Furthermore,
HCT116 PI3K Mut and WT cells showed very little difference when treated with these
inhibitors (Figure S7). These results indicate that the increased mitotic stress we observed is
specific for oncogeneic Ras.
Although the detailed mechanisms by which the Ras oncogene affects the activity of various
mitotic machineries remain to be elucidated, our data suggest that either impaired APC function
or an enhanced requirement for APC function might be a critical oncogenic stress associated
with Ras mutation. We tested this proposition using a panel of non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) cell lines with or without Ras mutations by assessing their sensitivity to shRNAmediated knockdown of either APC1 or APC4. Since these cell lines are not isogenic and
harbor many additional, different mutations, they are expected to display a range of sensitivities
to APC/C knockdown. However, as a group the NSCLC cells with Ras mutations are generally
more sensitive to shRNAs against APC1 and APC4, thereby further supporting the notion that
Ras mutation is associated with mitotic stress (Figure 6D).

If our in vitro and mouse xenograft analysis are relevant to Ras-driven tumors, patients bearing
tumors with activated Ras could benefit from decreased APC activity. Support for this
hypothesis comes from analysis of lung cancer tumor samples. We analyzed whether the
expression of any of our core mitotic RSL candidate genes and other genes directly associated
with APC function (all APC subunits, EMI1, EVI5, Cdc20, Cdh1 and UbcH10) correlated with
patient prognosis in a large cohort of lung cancer samples (Shedden et al., 2008). As the
mutation status of the Ras genes in these tumors is currently unknown but their transcriptional
profiles are known, we first derived a Ras expression signature from a separate, smaller set of
lung tumors whose Ras mutation status was known (Bhattacharjee et al., 2001). Importantly,
we were able to validate the predictive power of our Ras signature in two additional cohorts
of lung tumor samples (Figure S8). We applied this Ras signature to our large cohort to stratify
them as having positive, negative or neutral Ras signatures (Figure 7A). We defined 143 tumors
as having a strong Ras mutant signature (Ras signature +) and 116 as having a WT-Ras
signature (Ras signature -). We then asked if the expression levels of any of the 24 APC/C and
COPS9-associated core genes were associated with prognosis in a manner that was also
dependent on the tumor’s Ras signature status. Three genes, COPS3, CDC16 and EVI5, showed
such a correlation. Strikingly, lower expression of COPS3 and CDC16, and higher expression
of EVI5 – all consistent with potentially decreased APC/C activity – are each associated with
enhanced survival for patients bearing tumors with a positive Ras signature but have no
prognostic value in patients bearing tumors with a negative Ras signature (Figure 7B). The
correlation pattern of these genes remains significant after correction for multiple hypothesis
testing (p = 0.02). When the tumors were simultaneously investigated for all three signatures,
those with lower COPS3 and CDC16 together with higher EVI5 expression levels were
associated with a striking enhancement of survival for patients bearing tumors that exhibit a
positive Ras signature (Figure 7C). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that APC
activity could present a limiting factor in Ras mutant cancer cells and present an attractive drug
target for cancers with Ras mutation.

DISCUSSION
Using our pool-based shRNA platform in a genome-wide screen, we identified candidate Ras
synthetic lethal (RSL) genes whose depletion constitute synthetic lethality with the KRAS
oncogene. The vast majority of these are implicated in Ras function for the first time. Our study
suggests that a broad genetic network spanning multiple cellular functions is required to support
the Ras oncogenic state. Many genes in this network could be exploited as potential therapeutic
targets, as demonstrated by the synthetic lethal effect of their depletion by RNAi.

Mitotic stress as a hallmark of the Ras oncogenic state

HHMI Author Manuscript
HHMI Author Manuscript

We identified multiple mitotic genes whose inhibition results in synthetic lethality with mutant
Ras. These findings underscore a previously underappreciated role for Ras in regulating mitotic
progression and suggest that the Ras oncogene renders cells more dependent on key mitotic
proteins for survival, possibly by compromising the fidelity of mitosis itself and generating
mitotic stress. It has been shown that mutant Ras can induce chromosome instability (Denko
et al., 1994). How Ras affects mitotic progression is presently unclear although our data suggest
a role in regulation of prometaphase events, possibly chromosome congression. Several reports
have implicated the Ras/MAPK pathway in mitosis. Previously, we showed yeast Ras
genetically interacts with the kinetochore DASH/Dam1-Duo1 complex and thus might
influence spindle attachment and resolution of syntelic attachments (Li et al., 2005). In mitotic
Xenopus oocyte extracts, MAPK activity is required for mitotic entry and the maintenance of
the mitotic state, whereas its inactivation is required for mitotic exit (Wang et al., 2007;
Guadagno and Ferrell, 1998). In Xenopus oocytes arrested at metaphase of meiosis II, a
signaling pathway involving Mos-MAPK activates Erp1/Emi2 to inhibit APC/C activation
(Inoue et al., 2007; Nishiyama et al., 2007). Activated MAP kinase localizes to kinetochores
(Zecevic et al., 1998) and a hyperactive MAPK pathway can promote spindle checkpoint
bypass (Eves et al., 2006). In addition, the Ras effector, RASSF1A, has been proposed to
negatively regulate the APC in mammals (Whitehurst et al., 2008). We observe that Ras
activation causes a delay in mitotic progression, lengthening it by nearly 50%. In addition, we
find that transient treatment with monastrol arrests Ras mutant cells that upon release display
a massive increase in lagging chromosomes during anaphase. Our data suggest that Ras mutants
are experiencing mitotic stress and exacerbating this stress in particular ways such that
interference with KNL-1, PLK1 or MCAK, or addition of paclitaxel leads to stress overload
and cell death. In support of our findings, depletion of survivin and TPX2 has deleterious effects
on Ras mutant cells (Sarthy et al., 2007; Morgan-Lappe et al., 2007). Importantly, not all mitotic
perturbations selectively kill Ras mutants, as nocodazole treatment displayed no synthetic
lethality. It will be important to precisely dissect these mitotic defects to determine how they
might best be exploited to kill Ras mutant cells.
New drug targets for tumors with Ras mutations

HHMI Author Manuscript

A key goal in cancer research is the discovery of new drug targets that will selectively impair
the viability of cancer cells. Our approach enables the rapid identification of functional
vulnerabilities in cancer cells for therapeutic exploitation. Based on our genetic analysis, we
have identified at least 7 such enzymatic targets in the mitotic pathway alone, NAE1 (the E1
for Nedd8), the COP9 signalosome (a deneddylase), PLK1, MCAK, the APC, the proteasome
and possibly the SCF. Our studies strongly suggest that inhibiting each of these enzymatic
complexes could have efficacy in selectively killing cancer cells. Of these targets, all have
some relationship to control of the APC, which, along with NAE1 and the COP9 signalosome,
presents itself as a novel target in cancer cells. In support of this, the overproduction of two
inhibitors of the APC, EMI1 and EVI5 are also more toxic to Ras mutant cells. Furthermore,
we showed that NSCLCs with Ras mutations tend to be more sensitive to APC knockdown.
Thus, inhibiting APC function could prove efficacious in treating Ras-driven tumors of diverse
genetic backgrounds. In addition to mitotic regulators, our screen has identified a functionally
diverse set of RSL candidates with enzymatic activities and thus are potential drug candidates.
Examples are the helicase DHX8, the kinases JAK1, ERK5/MAPK7, ROIK1, the glutaminyl
t-RNA synthase QARS, the histone H3-K9 methryltransferase SUV39H2, the E2 SUMO
conjugating enzyme UBA2/SAE2, and the E1 and E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes UBE1
and UBC9/UBE2I, respectively. Further validation efforts will be needed to assess the
addiction of Ras mutant cells to these genes and determine their utility as drug targets.

Illumination of the mitotic stress phenotype of Ras mutants led us to the identification of a
number of small molecule inhibitors potentially useful for treating tumors with Ras mutations.
Two of these, the microtubule stabilizer paclitaxel and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib
(Velcade), have already been approved for the treatment of certain types of cancers. Velcade
has been approved for use in multiple myeloma (MM). Perhaps not coincidentally, MM has a
high frequency of Ras mutation, 30–50% in different studies and up to 80% in patients
experiencing a relapse (Liu et al., 1996; Bezieau et al., 2001). In addition, a significant number
of patients that do not have activating mutations in Ras, have an activated Ras pathway through
IL-6 signaling (Ogata et al., 1997; Rowley and Van Ness, 2002). Thus, the efficacy of Velcade
in treating MM might be in part due to their high prevalence of Ras mutations and acute
activation of Ras, and it would be important to determine if patients with Ras mutations respond
better to Velcade, thereby allowing Ras status to be used as a marker for patient stratification
in future clinical trials. The third agent, the PLK1 inhibitor BI-2536, is currently undergoing
phase I clinical trials (Mross et al., 2008). Although their efficacy with respect to Ras mutational
status remains to be tested clinically, finding three existing molecules as targets based on this
simple genetic screen bodes well for genetic dissection of cancers in the future.
Additional uses of the RSL genes in cancer analysis

HHMI Author Manuscript

In addition to the discovery of novel cancer drug targets and potential patient stratification
markers for clinical trials such as Ras for proteasome inhibitors, this screen has provided
markers that provide prognostic value for patient survival. Expression levels of three genes
identified in our study, COPS3, CDC16 and EVI5 show good correlations with patient survival
in the direction that reducing APC/C activity promotes survival in Ras-driven lung cancers but
has no predictive value in lung tumors lacking the Ras transcriptional signature. In support of
this, we found that although our Ras synthetic lethal screen was carried out in colon cancer
cells, the genetic dependency of the Ras oncogene on APC appears to be conserved in NSCLCs
as well. These findings lend strong support to the idea that the activity of the RSL genes will
affect tumorigenesis and survival in humans. It will be interesting to see whether these
transcriptional patterns correlate with survival in other Ras-dependent tumor types. A priori,
there is no reason that these genes in particular will correlate with survival in other cancer types
but it is possible that other members of this RSL gene cohort will display a similar ability in
different tumor contexts as each of them can become rate limiting for this process. Furthermore,
it is possible that other synthetic lethal cohorts for other oncogenes or cancer types will also
provide predictive value for other tumors types.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Our study illustrates the rapidity in which synthetic lethality analysis can be translated into
better therapeutic strategies. We find that therapeutic strategies aimed at suppressing the Ras
oncogenic pathway directly (e.g. RNAi against Ras), inhibiting the stress support pathways
protecting the cancer cells from oncogenic stress (e.g. RNAi and inhibitors against the
proteasome and the APC), or enhancing the stress phenotype of cancer cells (e.g. paclitaxel)
could all selectively impair the viability of Ras mutant cancer cells. Complementary to the
physical mapping of cancer genomes, functional approaches such as these can identify genetic
dependencies of cancer cells regardless of the mutational status of the gene of interest. Indeed,
a key point from this study is that among the many genes identified and verified in this screen
as potential drug targets, only Ras itself is a known oncogene. This suggests that there is a
much larger set of non-oncogen`es that can serve as drug targets in treating cancer. We have
recently proposed the concept of “non-oncogene addiction” (NOA) to describe the extensive
dependency of cancer cells on the function of diverse networks of genes – many of which are
neither mutated in cancer or oncogenic – for their growth and survival (Solimini et al., 2008;
Luo et al., 2009). Our study provides a glimpse of the landscape of NOA and suggests this is
an area that is likely to shed new light on the mechanisms of tumorigenesis and presents new

Experimental Procedures
shRNA library screen and micoarray hybridization
The pool-based shRNA screen using half-hairpin (HH) barcode deconvolution was carried out
as described in (Schlabach et al., 2008) at a representation of 1000, screened as 6 pools of
∼13,000 shRNAs per pool in independent triplicates. For each pair of corresponding PD0 and
PD17 samples, shRNA HH barcodes were PCR-recovered from genomic samples and
competitively hybridized to a microarray containing the corresponding probes. Custom
microarrays with HH barcode probe sequences were from Roche Nimblegen. For additional
information, see the supplemental information.

Sequence information for additional shRNAs and siRNAs used for validation is in
Supplemental Table 4. The DLD-1 and HCT116 isogenic cells were maintained in McCoy’s
5A media supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. NSCLC lines were maintained in
RPMI-1640 media with 10% FBS and antibiotics. For proliferation assays, cells were seeded
in either 24-well or 96-well plates and cell number was measured using CellTiterGLO
(Promega). For adherent colony assays, 1000 cells were seeded in each well of a 6-well plate
and colonies were counted 10 days later by Coomassie staining. For anchorage independent
colony assays, 1000 cells were seeded in each well of a 6-well plate in media containing 0.35%
low-melting point agarose and colonies were counted 3 weeks later by crystal violet staining.
Analysis of human lung tumor profiles

HHMI Author Manuscript

A gene signature of KRAS mutant versus wild-type tumors was defined, using a published
dataset of 84 lung adenocarcinomas (Bhattacharjee et al., 2001) for which the KRAS mutation
status of each tumor was known (genes with P<0.01, two-sided t-test were selected). This
KRAS signature was validated by both gene signature similarity scores and by gene set
enrichment analysis using two independent cohorts of lung cancer where the KRAS mutation
status was known for the tumors (Ding et al., 2008; Beer et al., 2002), (Figure S8). This
KRAS gene signature was then applied to analyze a gene expression profile dataset of 442
human lung adenocarcinomas (Shedden et al., 2008). Each tumor was scored for manifestation
of the Ras pathway as follows: The Shedden tumor profiles were generated among four
laboratories, and so within each laboratory subset, expression values for each gene were
normalized to standard deviations from the mean. Within each Shedden tumor profile, the
average of the genes high (“up”) in the Bhattacharjee KRAS signature were compared with the
average of the genes low (“down”) in the signature: tumors with higher expression of the “up”
genes as compared to the “down” genes (P<0.01, t-test) were classified as showing Ras
pathway manifestation (“Ras signature+”); tumors with higher expression of the “down” genes
(P<0.01) were classified as not showing Ras pathway manifestation (“Ras signature–”); tumors
that were intermediate between the above two groups were not used in subsequent analyses.
Within the Shedden “Ras signature+” tumors (N=143), tumors with expression levels greater
than the median for the given gene were compared with the rest of the tumors in the subset,
using Kaplan-Meier analysis for time to patient death. In addition, univariate Cox analysis
evaluated the expression of genes as a continuous variable for correlation with outcome. The
same Kaplan-Meier and Cox analyses were also carried out using the Shedden “Ras signature-”
tumors (N=116). To correct for multiple hypothesis testing, we carried out simulation tests to
estimate the probability of obtaining 3 out of 24 APC and COPS9 signalosome associated genes
that both had a p-value of <0.05 and whose relative expression levels changed in the predicted
direction in KRAS mutant tumors. Based on these criteria, the expected number of chance

significant hits was 0.57 genes (based on 1000 simulations, where both survival p-value and
direction of change was randomly generated for each of the 24 genes), and the probability of
getting 3 or more genes due to multiple testing was p = 0.02.

Cell cycle analysis
For cell cycle analysis, cells were analyzed using a BD LSR II FACS analyzer. Cells were
synchronization by double thymidine (Steegmaier et al., 2007) and were released into media
with the indicated drug, RO-3306 (10µM) (Vassilev et al., 2006), BI-2536 (100 nM)
(Steegmaier et al., 2007) and nocodazole (100 ng/ml). For one-step arrest in G2/M or in
prometaphase, cells were treated overnight with either RO-3306 (10 µM) or monastrol (100
µM), respectively.
Mouse xenograft tumor models

HHMI Author Manuscript

DLD-1 cells (5 million cells per site) or HCT116 cells (2 million cells per site) in suspension
were mixed with equal volumes of matrigel (BD bioscience) and injected subcutaneously into
both flanks of 6 week-old female nude mice (Charles River laboratory). Drug treatment began
after one week of cell injection. BI-2536 was given by i.v. under a twice per week schedule.
The dose of BI-2536 used for DLD-1 xenografts was 50 mg/kg for the first 2 weeks and then
increased to 75 mg/kg for the last week. The dose of BI-2536 used for HCT116 xenografts was
50 mg/kg. Measurement of tumor size was performed twice a week, and tumor volume was
estimated using the formula: volume = Length x Width2 x 0.5. The volume of each tumor at
serial time points was normalized with the initial tumor volume and comparison of tumor
volumes between the drug treatment group and vehicle control group was carried out using 2way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-tests.

Figure 5. Ras Mut cells are hypersensitive to APC/C and proteasome inhibition

A. Multiple shRNAs against APC1 and APC4 confer synthetic lethality in Ras Mut cells as
measured by the competition assay (for each shRNA p< 0.05 compared to respective FF
control, except # not significant).
B. Over expression of the APC/C inhibitor EMI1 and its binding protein EVI5 selectively
impair the viability of Ras Mut cells days (* p<0.05 compared to uninfected samples).
C. siRNA mediated knockdown of APC/C subunits synergizes with low concentration of
BI-2536 to selectively impair the viability of DLD-1 Ras Mut cells as measured by the
competition assay. Cells were transfected with pools of 4 siRNAs against each gene, 2 days

post transfection cells were treated with 10 nM of BI-2536 for 3 days before analysis by FACS
(* p<0.05 compared to untransfected samples in the sample treatment group).
D. shRNAs targeting various proteasome subunits exhibit synthetic lethality in Ras Mut cells
(for each shRNA p< 0.05 compared to respective FF control).
E. The proteasome inhibitors MG132 and bortezomib selectively decreased the fitness of
DLD-1 Ras Mut cells in a dose dependent fashion over 4 days (* p<0.05,** p<0.01 compared
to untreated samples).
F. MG132 and bortezomib preferentially induce the accumulation of Ras Mut DLD-1 cells as
assessed by FACS using staining (** p<0.01 compared to samples without drug treatment).
G. MG132 and bortezomib cause strong prometaphase arrest in mitotic DLD-1 Ras Mut cells
(shown are mean values of independent triplicates).

Figure 6. A model of mitotic regulation by Ras

A. BI-2536 attenuates DLD-1 tumor growth in vivo. Intravenous injection of BI-2536 started
1 week after subcutaneous injection of DLD1 cells. Tumor volume at each time point was
normalized to the initial tumor volume (* p<0.05 and ** p<0.01, 2-way ANOVA, error bars
indicate S.E.M.). Representative images of tumors after treatment are shown.
B. BI-2536 attenuates HCT116 tumor growth in vivo. Treatment of HCT116 xenografts was
similar to that described for DLD-1 tumors (* p<0.05 and ** p<0.01, 2-way ANOVA, error
bars indicate S.E.M.).
C. A model in which oncogenic Ras introduces mitotic stress that can be exacerbated to produce
lethality by interfering with kinetochore and APC/C function. Genes shaded green are RSL

genes, while yellow genes cause Ras-specific lethality when overproduced. Dotted lines
illustrate hypothetical connections between Ras and aspects of mitotic regulation leading to
mitotic stress.
D. Sensitivity of a panel of NSCLCs to APC/C shRNAs. NSCLCs with endogenous Ras
mutations (H23, H358, H647, H1299, H1734, H2030, H2122 and H2228) and without Ras
mutations (H522, H838, H1437, H1650, H1838 and H1975) were infected with shRNAs
against APC1 or APC4. Cell viability was compared to control FF shRNA infected samples 6
days post infection.

Figure 7. Candidate RSL genes associated with prognosis in human lung adenocarcinomas showing
activation of the Ras pathway

A. A gene expression signature for lung cancers with activated Ras pathway. A previously
derived gene expression signature (766 genes) of KRAS mutant versus wild-type lung tumors
was used as a probe in an additional set of expression profiles from 442 human lung
adenocarcinomas. Both tumors with significant (P<0.01) similarity or dissimilarity to the
KRAS signature (“Ras signature +” and “Ras signature –” tumors, respectively) were
considered for subsequent survival analyses.
B. RSL pathway genes that correlate with prognosis among “Ras signature+” tumors. The
expression of two RSL genes, COPS3 and CDC16, are inversely correlated with better survival

whereas expression of EVI5 correlates with better survival (P<0.05, both log-rank and Cox,
log-rank P-values shown). Within each of the two tumor subsets considered (“Ras signature
+” and “Ras signature −”), tumors with expression levels for the given gene greater than the
median (red line) were compared to the rest of the tumors in the subset (blue line), using KaplanMeier analysis.
C. Prognosis in “Ras signature +” and “Ras signature −” tumors using combined information
from COPS3CDC16, and EVI5. For each of the three genes, “+” and “−” is relative to their
median expression across the subset of tumors. Within each of the two tumor subsets, three
tumor groups were compared by Kaplan-Meier analysis: tumors with high CDC16, high
COPS3, and low EVI5 (“CDC16+ COPS3+ EVI−”); tumors with low CDC16, low COPS3,
and high EVI5 (“CDC16− COPS3− EVI+”); and tumors not falling into these two groups
(“other”). Log-rank P-values indicate significant differences among any of the three groups.
