Abstract
The NCI-60 cell lines are the most frequently studied human tumor cell lines in cancer research. This panel has
generated the most extensive cancer pharmacology database worldwide. In addition, these cell lines have been
intensely investigated, providing a unique platform for hypothesis-driven research focused on enhancing our
understanding of tumor biology. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of coding variants in the NCI-60 panel
of cell lines identiﬁed by whole exome sequencing, providing a list of possible cancer speciﬁc variants for the
community. Furthermore, we identify pharmacogenomic correlations between speciﬁc variants in genes such as
TP53, BRAF, ERBBs, and ATAD5 and anticancer agents such as nutlin, vemurafenib, erlotinib, and bleomycin
showing one of many ways the data could be used to validate and generate novel hypotheses for further
investigation. As new cancer genes are identiﬁed through large-scale sequencing studies, the data presented here
for the NCI-60 will be an invaluable resource for identifying cell lines with mutations in such genes for hypothesisdriven research. To enhance the utility of the data for the greater research community, the genomic variants are
freely available in different formats and from multiple sources including the CellMiner and Ingenuity websites.

Introduction
The NCI-60 human tumor cell line panel (1) is used by a
broad range of cancer investigators and by the NCI Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) to discover novel anticancer drugs (2). This panel represents an invaluable and
publicly accessible platform of pharmacological, genomic,
metabolomic, biochemical, and molecular datasets (3–8). This
study reports ﬁndings from whole exome sequencing (WES) of
the NCI-60 panel of cell lines. In addition, pharmacogenomic
analyses provide examples of a few of the many ways the
variant data could be used to generate novel hypotheses. Our
study complements two recently published large-scale cancer
cell line sequencing studies, which used a limited number of
genes (9, 10), because our work provides the whole exome

variants for the entire NCI-60 cell lines. The data are made
available through the CellMiner, NCI DTP and Ingenuity
Systems' websites (11).

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
The list of cell lines in the NCI-60 panel and their tissue
origins are given in Supplementary Fig. S8. DNA was extracted
from cells and ﬁngerprinted as described before (12).
Exome capture and sequencing
Brieﬂy, 38 Mb of coding region for each cell line was captured
using the Agilent SureSelect All Exon v1.0 Kit (Agilent). Genomic DNA (3 mg) was sheared using the Covaris S2 ultrasonicator (Covaris) using the settings duty cycle 10%, intensity
5%, cycle/burst 200, and time 60s, which yielded a fragment size
distribution with a mean at 200 bp. Libraries were generated
using standard Illumina library protocol (Illumina) followed
by size selection using ChromaSpin TE200 spin columns
(Clonetech). Pre- and postcapture steps were conducted following the manufacturers' protocol (Agilent). The samples
were sequenced as paired-end 80-mer reads on an Illumina
Genome Analyzer IIx instrument (Illumina) following the
manufacturers' protocol.
Data processing and variant calls
Fastq ﬁles were aligned against the reference human
genome build 19 (hg19) using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner
(13). Alignment ﬁles were base quality score recalibrated and
locally realigned around indels with GATK (14) and marked

for duplicates using PICARD tools (picard.sourceforge.net).
Alignment ﬁles and variant calls can be accessed from the
links provided (11). Consensus genotype calls were generated
using samtools mpileup (15) and annotated using the Annovar
package (16). Variants were further ﬁltered for the SureSelect
bait region, a minimum read depth of 6 and a minimum quality
score of 30 for single nucleotide variant (SNV) and 60 for indels,
producing the ﬁnal variant calls.
Drug activity determination
Drug activity was determined by the DTP human cancer cell
line screen (11). The concentration of agent required to cause
50% growth inhibition (GI50) as measured at 48 hours by the
sulphorhodamine B assay (17) was determined.
Gene expression and other NCI-60 molecular
characterization
mRNA expression, miRNA expression, copy number, and
protein measurements are publicly available from DTP or from
CellMiner (excluding the protein data; ref. 11). The details
pertaining to data acquisition and analysis were previously
published (18).
Volcano plots
The x-axis of a volcano plot depicts the difference in mean
log GI50 between the cell lines containing a mutation in the
speciﬁed gene and the cell lines not containing such a mutation. The y-axis depicts the statistical signiﬁcance level for the
comparison of log GI50 for those 2 groups of cell lines with
larger values indicating smaller P values. On a volcano plot for a
gene, the points represent the compounds. On a volcano plot
for a compound, the points represent the genes. For a volcano
plot representing a gene, the false discovery rate can be limited
to 0.2 or less by restricting attention to the 310 clinical and
investigational compounds with P values no greater than
0.0005. When examining all of the screening compounds, the
false discovery rate will be greater unless attention is restricted
by a more stringent signiﬁcance cut-off (e.g., 10 4) and an
imposed cut-off on difference in log GI50 between mutated and
wild-type groups (e.g.,  0.5). In general, however, the volcano
plots are used either to conﬁrm previously identiﬁed hypotheses or to generate hypotheses that require independent
validation.
Super Learner prediction models
Using GI50 data on the NCI-60 for 103 U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)-approved and 207 investigational oncology drugs and the 711 genes with at least 5 cell lines containing
a type II variant in the gene, we estimated a predictor for each
drug using the Super Learner algorithm (19). The predictor
uses the gene-level mutation proﬁle to predict the log GI50 for
each drug. The Super Learner is an ensemble-based prediction
methodology that combines different machine-learning predictors into a single optimal predictor based on minimizing the
cross-validated risk. The base algorithms for the Super Learner
include elastic net regression, gradient-boosting regression,
bagging, CART, random forests, neural networks, and support
vector machines. In total, 35 prediction algorithms were com-

www.aacrjournals.org

bined for the Super Learner ensemble. We do not expect a
single prediction algorithm (e.g., elastic net regression) to be
optimal across all 310 drugs, and the Super Learner allows the
ﬁnal predictor to data-adaptively up-weight the best algorithms for the ﬁnal predictor. Examining the weights for each
algorithm across the 310 drugs (data not shown) shows great
variability, indicating we should see a beneﬁt with the Super
Learner ensemble approach. Within a drug, the Super Learner
predicts the log GI50 based on the gene-level mutation proﬁles.
To compare across the drugs with different potencies, the
log GI50 values need to be normalized. We deﬁne the normalized log GI50 for a cell line as the log GI50 minus the mean
log GI50 for that drug in all the other cell lines. For ROC
analysis, we classiﬁed a cell line as sensitive to a drug if its
true-normalized log GI50 was less than 0.5, and insensitive if
the value was greater than 0.5.

Results
The variant calls were generated as described in Materials
and Methods, where we ﬁltered variants with a minimum
quality of 30 (60 for small insertions/deletions) and a minimum depth of 6 with at least 3 alternate alleles over the
targeted 38 Mb coding region. Because matched normals are
not available for cell lines, we conducted a more stringent
ﬁltering to identify potential cancer-speciﬁc variants. Using
this ﬁltering, the variants were divided into 2 groups: type I
variants corresponding to common (and possibly germline)
variants and type II variants enriched for acquired cancerspeciﬁc variants (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2). We
obtained more than 1.2 million type I and 60,005 type II
variants in the NCI-60 cell lines.
Although a limitation of cell line sequencing is the lack of
available normal-matched tissue for comparison, the NCI-60
panel does allow comparisons between cell lines from 9
distinct tissues of origin. NCI-60 cell lines with known microsatellite instability (MSI; Supplementary Fig. S3) have very high
type II variant counts (Fig. 1A). However, HCC2998, a colon
cancer cell line not known to have MSI, has the highest number
of type II variants. In contrast to the known MSI cell lines, more
than 98% of HCC2998 type II variants are SNVs (Supplementary
Fig. S4), suggesting that this hypermutator phenotype arises
from a mechanism other than MSI. Of interest, HCC2998
carries a POLE exonuclease domain missence variant coding
for a P286R mutation in POLe (Supplementary Fig. S5). Previous reports indicate that impaired POLe proofreading results
in a high rate of single nucleotide substitutions and increased
tumor formation (20) and POLE mutations in colorectal cancer
has recently been reported (21). HCC2998 seems to exemplify
this phenomenon, providing a reagent for further investigation
and illustrating the utility of the NCI-60 WES data.
Given the diversity in the NCI-60 panel based on the tissue of
origin, the WES data reveal important information about the
etiology of each subgroup. As is evident from Fig. 1B, there is a
wide range of transition-to-transversion ratios (ti/tv) among
the NCI-60 panel. Melanoma cell lines have the highest ti/tv
(3.93) with higher C:G to T:A transitions, which is the major
mode of change for UV-induced DNA damage (22). In contrast,
lung cancer cell lines have a ti/tv (0.67) indicative of tobacco

smoke-induced DNA damage (23). Thus, the WES data supports the prior notion that the NCI-60 panel retains disease
etiology signatures (7).
Figure 2A shows a map of the 10 most frequently mutated
genes in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database (24). We annotated the WES variant calls as
those present in the COSMIC database (v59) and those that
are absent in COSMIC but predicted to be deleterious by the
Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant (SIFT; ref. 25) or PolyPhen (26)
algorithms. TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene overall,
whereas BRAF is the most frequently mutated gene among
melanoma cell lines (Fig. 2A). Although most of the variants
identiﬁed in these 10 genes are already annotated in COSMIC,
novel variants in these 10 genes were also observed. Although,
the lack of normal tissue makes it almost impossible to validate
these as somatic changes, these variants were not observed in
either the 1,000 Genomes Project (27), or in the 5,600 normal
whole exomes available through the NHLBI Exome Sequencing
Project (28). Besides the many well-deﬁned cancer genes such as
those in Fig. 2A, large-scale tumor sequencing efforts by others
continue to lead to the discovery of novel cancer genes, such as
the 16 genes listed in Fig. 2B. Because the NCI-60 cell lines are so
well characterized and readily available, they are ideal tools for
hypothesis-driven research of these novel cancer genes/mutations identiﬁed by large-scale sequencing efforts. Details for
these particular mutations or for any other gene mutation can
be downloaded from the public domains, including CellMiner
(Fig. 3) or Ingenuity website (Supplementary Fig. S6).

Cancer Res; 73(14) July 15, 2013

To show the utility of this unique dataset and illustrate one
of many ways to apply these data in hypothesis-driven research,
we carried out an integrated pharmacogenomic investigation.
The fact that the NCI-60 panel has been used to screen thousands of compounds provides a rich resource for testing
the relationship of variants in genes to drug response. Among
43,225 compounds screened for activity against the NCI-60 cell
lines (as of September 2012), 15,898 showed high dynamic range
in their GI50 estimates across all cell lines. For each gene with at
least 5 cell lines containing a type II variant, we evaluated the
association of log GI50 to variants in genes for all of the screened
compounds. TP53, the most frequently mutated gene in the
NCI-60 panel, shows strong correlation with drug response.
MDM2 inhibitors are effective agents in cell lines with wild-type
p53 (Fig. 4A), where they can induce cell death. Of the 15,898
compounds and 310 FDA-approved or investigational oncology drugs, the activities of 2 clinically relevant MDM2 inhibitors show strong negative correlation with mutant p53 (Fig.
4B). Nutlin-3 gives the highest statistical signiﬁcance score for
its activity in p53 wild-type cell lines (Fig. 4B and C). MI-219,
a known MDM2 inhibitor, exhibits a similar strong negative
correlation with mutant p53 (Fig. 4B). In contrast, National
Service Center (NSC)-670177 (Supplementary Table S1) shows
signiﬁcant selectivity for the p53 mutant cells. However, the
proposed p53-speciﬁc compound reactivation of p53 and
induction of tumor cell apoptosis (RITA; NSC-652287; ref. 29),
initially identiﬁed as a DNA cross-linking agent (30), showed
little evidence of selective activity for cell lines with p53

wild-type status and only limited correlation with nutlin-3
(Supplementary Fig. S7A), questioning the claim that RITA acts
speciﬁcally as a p53-reactivating compound. As for comparison,
RITA displays far less selectivity for p53 wild-type cells than
the classical DNA-targeted agent mithramycin. As expected,
expression of the well-known components of the p53 pathway,
MDM2 and miR-34a (31) correlate with p53 wild-type cell
lines (Fig. 4E and F). Additional pharmacogenomic correlations
between TP53 mutational status, miRNAs, mRNA transcripts,
or other agents are listed in Supplementary Fig. S7B. Integrating
additional genomic datasets, such as gene and miRNA expression data (18) strengthens the value in all these comprehensive
datasets for the NCI-60 panel.
We further supplemented this work with cross-validated
multivariate analyses. For each of the 310 FDA-approved or
investigational oncology drugs, we developed a Super Learner
ensemble machine-learning model predicting log GI50 based
on variants in genes. We included genes with type II variants in
5 or more cell lines across the NCI-60 panel. Leave-one-out
cross-validation was used to evaluate the ability of such
modeling to distinguish sensitive from insensitive cell lines
for individual drugs and to select active drugs for individual cell
lines. We developed these 310 models for each loop of a crossvalidation in which one cell line was omitted and the remaining
cell lines were used as a training set. Those models were then

M

used to predict the log GI50 values for all drugs for the omitted
cell line thereby predicting the most active drugs (smallest
normalized log GI50; see Materials and Methods) against this
cell line (Supplementary Table S2). Using these models, we
generated cross-validated receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curves for each cell line (Supplementary Fig. S8). The
ROC curve plots sensitivity versus one minus speciﬁcity for
identifying active drugs. The area under the curve (AUC)
between the ROC curve and the diagonal line is a measure of
the predictive accuracy of the WES-based models. A large AUC
value for a cell line indicates that the mutation spectrum of the
cell line is informative for discriminating active from inactive
drugs. The set of drugs analyzed, however, contains many
cytotoxics, for which the predictive model based only on
mutation spectrum was poorly informative. Our models
included only mutation status and did not attempt to distinguish the confounding between mutation status and cell line
lineage. Further studies with comprehensive models that
include copy number, transcript abundance, and methylation
status should yield more accurate predictions.
The ROC curves provide valuable insight into cancer biology.
For instance, among the NCI-60 melanoma cell lines, SK-MEL-2
has the lowest AUC value (Fig. 5A). This is particularly interesting because SK-MEL-2 is the only non-BRAF-V600E mutant
melanoma cell line with an activating NRAS-Q61R mutation.

As shown with the volcano plot in Fig. 5B, the 3 BRAF-V600E–
speciﬁc inhibitors PLX-4720, vemurafenib (Fig. 5C) and SB590885 stand out with extremely high signiﬁcance and differential mean GI50 in the BRAF-mutant cell lines. All the MEK
inhibitors (blue font) including selumetinib (Fig. 5D) and hypothemycin (Fig. 5E) show highly signiﬁcant selectivity and
differential GI50, indicating their therapeutic value in cancer
cells with activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
pathway. Notably, one compound, NSC-678518 showed extreme
selectivity for the BRAF-mutated cells. NSC-678518, the anthrax
lethal factor, was identiﬁed in a screen for agents with similar
inhibitory proﬁles to another MAPK kinase inhibitor, PD098059,
and shown to proteolytically inactivate such kinases (32).

mutations in protein kinase target genes are strong indicators
of response to clinically relevant targeted drugs. In addition,
such observation could be generalized to key signaling pathways. Ten distinct kinase inhibitors from 3 major target classes
cluster separately depending on the mutations in 6 genes:
BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PTEN, and ERBB2 (Fig. 5F). These
effects can be viewed in the context of the MAPK and phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) pathways downstream of receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTK).
One of the most clinically relevant RTK is the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR). However, as showed by Garnett
and colleagues (10), it is critical to integrate genomic mutation
data with transcript levels to correlate and possibly predict
drug responses. The NCI-60 provides a solid background
for studying gene expression (see MDM2 example in Fig. 4E;

ref. 18), and its large drug database offers unique opportunities to query drug response parameters. To test this possibility, we examined the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, whose activity
is highly correlated with geﬁtinib and lapatinib in the NCI-60
(see Fig. 6 in ref. 18). Overall, high expression of EGFR (ERBB1)
and ERBB2 are determinants of cellular response to erlotinib
(Fig. 6B). However, the colon and central nervous system
(CNS) cell lines are generally insensitive to erlotinib in spite
of high EGFR and ERBB2 expression. This can be rationalized
by taking into account mutations in the MAPK or PI3K pathways, a common mechanism of resistance (33), which are
present in all 7 colon and 4 of 6 CNS cell lines (Fig. 6B).

analogues, show strong activity toward these cell lines. ATAD5,
the human homolog of yeast ELG1, is essential for maintaining
genome stability through its functions in deubiqitinating
proliferating cell nuclear antigen and is known to be mutated
in endometrial cancer (34–36). Genotype calls revealed 10 cell

delCAATGT. Of the 10 cell lines, 3 are renal (ACHN, CAKI-1,
RXF-393), where earlier work suggests dimethane sulfonate
analogues, such as DMS612, as effective agents against renal
cancer (37) and are being investigated phase I trials in renal
cancer patients (#09-C-0111). Interestingly, there are addition-

al germline variants in ATAD5, that are also present exclusively
in the same set of 10 cell lines. When we looked for possible
haplotypes in the Hapmap database, we discovered a region of
linkage-disequilibrium spanning more than 300 kb (Fig. 7B).
Therefore, this particular haplotype could be a response modiﬁer during chemotherapy with DNA-damaging agents. These
results illustrate the discovery potential of exonic variant data
when integrated with previously available NCI-60 databases.

Discussion
In this study, we provide WES analysis of the widely used
NCI-60 cell line panel. We show that the overall pattern of

mutation is strikingly divergent between cell lines, ranging
from 172 to 9205 type II variants. As expected, higher variant
rates are observed in MSI cell lines; but remarkably, the highest
number of SNVs was observed in HCC2998, a colon cancer cell
line in which we discovered a defect in the proofreading
domain of POLe. The signature of speciﬁc carcinogens is
readily discernible in lung cancer and melanoma, which show
very low (0.67) and high (3.93) ti/tv ratio, respectively. Variants
in established cancer genes are abundantly represented in the
NCI-60, and numerous examples of variants in recently implied
cancer genes are also present.
In addition to the mutational data provided in this article,
substantial drug sensitivity data for tens of thousands of
compounds and multiple other types of biological data are
available for the NCI-60. Using straightforward approaches
(see Fig. 3) together with more sophisticated analyses, we were
able to show the inﬂuence of speciﬁc variants for TP53, BRAF,
KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA, PTEN, and ERBBs on the response to
clinically relevant targeted agents (nutlin, vemurafenib, selumetinib, hypothemycin, rapamycin, wortmannin, perifosine,

aspects of those results that may merit further study. For
example, even though targeted inhibitors of activated BRAFV600E have been widely studied, the comprehensive NCI-60
datasets offers a unique opportunity to identify additional
mechanisms of resistance and possibly offer novel means to
overcome acquired resistance. The power of the NCI-60 WES
variants is apparent from the observation that common variants in the human population may have a profound effect
on drug response. Of course, our observation regarding the
ATAD5 gene locus requires further studies; however, it opens
up a completely new perspective on common variants and
their phenotypes in the context of DNA damaging agents and
the ongoing clinical trials with DMS612 (37).
In comparison to the 2 recent studies conducted with more
cell lines (947 in ref. 9 and 639 in ref. 10), our study integrates far
more drugs (approximately 20,000 vs. 24 in ref. 9 and 130 in
ref. 10; see volcano plots in Figs. 4, 5, 7, and Supplementary
Figures) and provides a comprehensive dataset of all exonic
variants for the NCI-60 cell lines, whereas 1,600 genes were
sequenced in ref. 9 and 64 cancer-related genes in ref. 10. Given

invaluable data, and made this dataset public for the greater
community to use and analyze. This is critical for expanding
our knowledge in understanding tumorigenesis and the genomic bases of drug sensitivity in years to come as many more
cancer-related gene aberrations are discovered.
Importantly, the availability of this sequencing data will
allow increased precision in the use of these common cell lines
as experimental models and, as indicated above, expand the
utility of other cell line panels for drug development. To enable
this important step forward, the complete dataset is readily
accessible in 2 forms, the easily searchable CellMiner database
and a preﬁltered, annotated Ingenuity Systems database.
Through these portals, cancer investigators will be able to
select precisely the cell line models most genetically suited to
their research. The availability of the variant information
allows the formulation and testing of hypotheses arising from
the entire range of projects using the NCI-60 or its components.
In conclusion, our datasets add substantial depth to the
already extensive characterization of the NCI-60 tumor cell
panel and provide an invaluable resource for ongoing investigations in cancer cell biology and pharmacology.

study, such comprehensive analyses as performed by these 2
studies offer enormous opportunities. The WES data that we
are providing for the NCI-60 also enables the vast compound
activity database to be used as a resource for drug development
to complement genomic studies conducted using larger cell
line panels. That is, when one discovers a genomic variant as a
molecular target using other cell line resources, using the WES
data for the NCI-60 one can potentially identify screened
compounds with selective activity for that target. We have
limited our work to the exploration of certain aspects of this
