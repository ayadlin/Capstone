Abstract:

Escape from cellular senescence induction is a potent mechanism for chemoresistance.
Cellular senescence can be induced in breast cancer cell lines by the removal of
estrogen signaling with tamoxifen or by the accumulation of DNA damage induced by
the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. Long term culturing of the hormone-sensitive
breast cancer cell line MCF-7 in doxorubicin (MCF-7/DoxR) reduced the ability of
doxorubicin, but not tamoxifen, to induce senescence. Two pathways that are often
upregulated in chemo- and hormonal-resistance are the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR and
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways. To determine if active Akt-1 and Raf-1 can influence
drug-induced senescence, we stably introduced activated ∆Akt-1(CA) and ∆Raf-1(CA)
into drug-sensitive and doxorubicin-resistant cells. Expression of a constitutivelyactive Raf-1 construct resulted in higher baseline senescence, indicating these
cells possessed the ability to undergo oncogene-induced-senescence. Constitutive
activation of the Akt pathway significantly decreased drug-induced senescence in
response to doxorubicin but not tamoxifen in MCF-7 cells. However, constitutive Akt1 activation in drug-resistant cells containing high levels of active ERK completely
escaped cellular senescence induced by doxorubicin and tamoxifen. These results
indicate that up regulation of the Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway in the presence
of elevated Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling together can contribute to drug-resistance
by diminishing cell senescence in response to chemotherapy. Understanding how
breast cancers containing certain oncogenic mutations escape cell senescence in
response to chemotherapy and hormonal based therapies may provide insights into
the design of more effective drug combinations for the treatment of breast cancer.

Introduction

and their deregulation is often implicated in malignant
transformation [2-9]. Indeed, the PI3K p110 catalytic
subunit gene (PIK3CA) is one of the most frequently
mutated genes in breast cancer [10-11]. Oncogenic
mutations often elicit a permanent cell cycle withdrawal,
termed oncogene-induced-senescence (OIS), to eliminate
pre-malignant cells before they acquire additional
mutations [12].
Phosphatidylinositol (PI) (3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 are

Signal transduction cascades downstream of
epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) isoforms
(e.g., EGFR & HER2) have been associated with breast
cancer development and resistance to anticancer agents
[1]. Among the signaling pathways downstream of these
receptors, the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/
mTOR pathways have been shown to regulate apoptosis

produced by class 1A PI3Ks and recruit phosphoinositide
dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) as well as Akt isoforms to
the plasma membrane by interacting with their pleckstrin
homology (PH) domains [13-17]. Colocalization of PDK1
with Akt proteins at the plasma membrane causes PDK1
to phosphorylate Akt proteins at a threonine residue
(T308) [18-19] and a serine residue (S473). Activation
of PDK1 and Akt by class 1A PI3Ks is negatively
regulated by phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted
on chromosome ten (PTEN) [4,6,8,16,20,21]. PTEN
removes phosphate groups from PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)
P3 added by PI3K as well as from tyrosine phosphorylated
proteins including focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and
Shc [4,16,20,22]. PTEN also has important roles in the
nucleus and can regulate genome stability [6, 21]. In some
cases, there are complex interactions with the p53, PI3K/
PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways which determine whether
senescence, quiescence or autophagy occurs in response
to DNA damaging drugs [12, 15, 23-49].
Diverse mechanisms regulate PTEN expression [7,
50-53], including gene deletion, alterations in mRNA
splicing, subcellular localization, epigenetic repression
and protein:protein interactions [51]. There are numerous
microRNAs (miRNAs) which target the PTEN gene to
inhibit its expression [4,6,50,54,55]. Furthermore there
is a pseudo PTEN gene [6] which serves as a decoy to
bind and neutralize some of these miRNAs. PTEN
interacts with p53 to influence key points in the regulation
of cellular proliferation. Loss of these tumor suppressor
interactions can lead to cancer or in some cases cellular
senescence [12,53,56].
PTEN mutations occur in breast cancer at varying
frequencies (5-21%). While PTEN is deleted in certain
cancers, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is a more common
genetic event (30%) leading to decreased PTEN expression
[50,57]. Additionally, PTEN expression can be decreased by
promoter methylation [50]. In one study, 26% of primary
breast cancers had low PTEN levels which correlated with
lymph node metastases and poor prognoses [58]. Disruption
of PTEN activity by various mechanisms frequently results
in Akt activation.
Elevated Akt activity can have pleiotropic effects
on cell growth, which include activation/inactivation of
transcription factors controlling pivotal gene expression,
inactivation of pro-apoptotic molecules by their
phosphorylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation,
or by regulating the efficiency of translation of mRNAs
involved in growth. Akt can regulate translation directly
by activating mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
or indirectly by inhibiting TSC2. Active mTOR then
can phosphorylate ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K), which
in turn regulates the efficiency of translation of certain
mRNAs and also functions in a negative feedback loop
to control Akt activity [7,16,59-61]. The activities of Akt
and p70S6K along with other molecules are essential
for the formation of the eIF4F translation complex. The
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

eIF4F complex is necessary for the translation of mRNAs
containing long 5’UTRs which are highly-structured and
have an elevated G+C content. These “weak” mRNAs
often encode proteins involved in oncogenesis and
survival such as c-Myc, Mcl-1, cyclin-D, VEGF and
survivin. Furthermore p70S6K has important roles in
autophagy and cellular senescence [62-65].
Akt, mTOR and p70S6K activation have been
associated with a more severe prognosis in breast and
other cancers [66-73]. Targeting the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/
mTOR pathway may prove effective therapy in a variety
of cancers [9,16,74-76]. Indeed some studies have
evaluated the effectiveness of targeting mTOR in PTENnegative cells [69]. Elevated active Akt expression has
been associated with both chemo- and hormonal resistance
in breast cancer [67-68,77]. Cells expressing activated
Akt may be more sensitive to mTOR inhibitors such as
rapamycin and may increase the efficacy in combination
with chemo- and hormonal-based therapies [6,69]. A
distinct advantage of targeting mTOR with rapamycin
is that it has been used for many years to treat organ
transplant patients. Rapamycin is now being examined in
treatment of certain cancers and in the prevention of aging
and other diseases including AIDS [7,8,78]. Previously
it was determined that mutated forms of Akt and PTEN
can induce chemotherapeutic- and hormonal-based drug
resistance in breast cancer [5,67,77]. PTEN mutants that
eliminate the lipid phosphatase activity result in activated
Akt expression and drug resistance, which can be reversed
by the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin [5].
In addition to deregulation of the PI3K/mTOR
pathway, the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway plays a critical
role in cellular transformation and drug resistance.
Growth factor/cytokine/mitogen activation recruits a Src
homology 2 (Shc) domain containing adaptor protein
to the C-terminus of the receptor [6-8,60]. Shc in turn
recruits the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2
(Grb2) protein and the son of sevenless (SOS) homolog
protein, resulting in the loading of membrane-bound Ras
with GTP [6-8,60]. Additionally, Ras can be activated
by growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), such
as insulin receptor (IR), and insulin-like growth factor
one receptor (IGF1-R), via intermediates like insulin
receptor substrate (IRS) proteins that bind Grb2 [68,60,79]. Ras:GTP can recruit Raf to the membrane where
it becomes activated, likely via a Src-family tyrosine
kinase [6-8,60,80,81]. Ras and Raf are members of multigene families and there are three Ras members (KRAS,
NRAS and HRAS) and three Raf members (BRAF, CRAF
(a.k.a Raf-1) and ARAF) [6-8,60]. Raf is responsible for
serine/threonine phosphorylation of mitogen-extracellular
activated protein kinase kinase-1 (MEK1) [6-8,60].
MEK1 phosphorylates extracellular signal-regulated
kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) at specific threonine and
tyrosine residues [6-8,60]. Activated ERK1 and ERK2
serine/threonine kinases phosphorylate and activate a

that deregulation of PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR, and to a
lesser extent the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, decreases
drug-induced cellular senescence in response to chemo-/
hormonal therapy.

variety of substrates, including p90 ribosomal six kinase
(p90Rsk1) [6-8,60,82,83]. ERK1/2 has many downstream
(>60) and even upstream substrates. The Ras/Raf/MEK/
ERK pathway plays pivotal roles in: differentiation,
chemotherapeutic drug resistance, cellular senescence and
metastasis [2,84-94]. Thus suppression of MEK and ERK
activities will have profound effects on cell growth. While
Ras is frequently mutated in human cancers overall, it is
rarely mutated in breast cancer. However, this pathway
can be activated by multiple other mechanisms including:
mutations in upstream receptors, mutations in pathway
components, subcellular localization and changes in the
level of expression of pathway constituents and regulators
[82-83,95-98].
We have previously demonstrated that activated
HRAS, CRAF, AKT1 and mutated phosphatase-inactive
PTEN genes confer drug resistance to breast cancer cells
[2,3,5,99,100]. Cellular senescence is clearly a very
important component in regulating cancer development
and responding to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics as
well as anti-cancer dietary considerations [12,101-108].
However, it remains unclear as to how drug-resistant cells
bypass the induction of cellular senescence.
In the following study, we examined the effects of
activated PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/
ERK pathways on the induction of cellular senescence in

Doxorubicin and Tamoxifen Induce Cellular
Senescence in MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells
We first examined the ability of doxorubicin and 4
hydroxy-tamoxifen (4HT) to induce senescence in p53
wild type (WT) and estrogen receptor (ER) positive MCF7 breast cancer cells [2,3,5,99,100]. Cells were plated in
6 well plates containing an etched, gridded coverslip on
the bottom of the well at 5 x 106 cells/well. The MCF7 cells adhered to the etched coverslips and essentially
grew as colonies (Figure 1). After 6 days, the cells on the
coverslips were processed for β-galactosidase staining as
described [109]. Both doxorubicin (10-100 nM) and 4HT
(50-1000 nM) induced senescence in MCF-7 cells in a
dose-dependent fashion (Figure 1). At high concentrations
of 4HT (1000 nM), MCF-7 cells did not grow and form

MCF-7 cells as determined by MTT analysis.
The ability of MCF-7 and MCF7/DoxR cells
to undergo cellular senescence was quantified from
β-galactosidase-positive cells in the presence of
doxorubicin (10, 50 and 100nM) for 6 days (Figure 2,
Panels A and B). While MCF7/DoxR cells displayed
lower levels of senescence compared to MCF-7 cells at
10 and 50 nM, similar levels of senescence was achieved
at 100 nM, suggesting that drug-resistance cells have a
diminished ability to arrest (Figure 2, Panels A and B).

drug resistant cells [MCF7/∆Akt-1(CA)DoxR] resulted
in the complete abrogation of drug-induced senescence
at all doses examined (Panel D), suggesting an interplay
between active Akt-1 and other resistance mechanisms
acquired by the MCF7/DoxR cells. We have observed
that MCF7/DoxR cells overexpress activated ERK, but
not activated Akt when cultured in medium containing
doxorubicin. In addition, we have seen that MCF7/∆Akt1(CA) also overexpress activated ERK, suggesting the
presence of both active pathways may serve to prevent
drug-induced senescence.

Ectopic Akt-1 Expression Promotes Resistance
of MCF-7 Cells to Induction of Senescence after
Doxorubicin Treatment
Since the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway is
frequently altered in breast cancer and associated with
drug resistance, we used a retrovirus to stably-transfect
MCF-7 cells with a constitutively-active Akt-1 gene
[∆Akt-1(CA)]. Expression of activated Akt-1 alone was
sufficient to increase the IC50 for doxorubicin by 2-fold
in MCF7/∆Akt-1(CA) [100]. Similar to MCF7/DoxR
cells, expression of ∆Akt-1 reduced senescence 10-fold
compared to MCF-7 cells when the cells were treated with
50 nM doxorubicin (Figure 2, Panels A and C).
We also isolated MCF7/∆Akt-1(CA) cells with
increased resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs by
culturing the cells in medium containing 25 nM
doxorubicin. These cells were named MCF7/∆Akt1(CA)DoxR. The MCF7/∆Akt-1(CA)DoxR were 5-fold
more frequently recovered from MCF7/∆Akt-1(CA)
than the MCF7/DoxR were from MCF-7 cell line. The
MCF7/∆Akt-1(CA)DoxR cells were approximately 6.7fold more resistant to doxorubicin than control MCF-7
cells [100].
Interestingly, constitutive activation of Akt-1 in the

Effects of Ectopic Raf-1 Expression on the
Induction of Senescence
Since we observed elevated activated ERK1/2
expression in MCF7/DoxR cells, the activity of the
Raf/MEK/ERK cascade was manipulated in MCF-7
cells in order to determine whether signals transduced
by this pathway control the induction of drug-induced
senescence. MCF-7 cells were stably transfected with
a constitutively-active Raf-1 gene [Raf-1(CA)] using a
retrovirus [2,3]. Expression of constitutively-active Raf-1
increased resistance to doxorubicin by 9-fold compared to
parental MCF-7 cells [2,3].
Consistent with prior reports, activated Raf-1
expression increased baseline cellular senescence in
the absence of stress by 3-fold, indicating that MCF-

7 cells were undergoing oncogene-induced senescence
(OIS) (Figure 2, Panels A and E). MCF7/∆Raf-1(CA)
cells treated with 10 nM doxorubicin showed a 2.4-fold
increase in cellular senescence, whereas similar treatments
did not induce cellular senescence in either MCF-7 or
MCF7/∆Akt-1(CA) cells (Figure 2, Panels A, C and E).
Interestingly, increasing concentrations of doxorubicin
in MCF7/∆Raf-1(CA) cells failed to induce senescence
to as high levels as observed in MCF-7 or unselected
MCF7/Akt-1(CA) cells.
We also isolated MCF7/∆Raf-1(CA)DoxR cells
with increased resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs
by culturing the cells in medium containing 25 nM
doxorubicin. These cells are approximately 5-fold more
resistant to doxorubicin than MCF7/∆Raf-1(CA) cells.
The MCF7/∆Raf-1(CA)DoxR cells had a 5.8-fold higher
baseline level of cellular senescence than MCF-7 cells
(Figure 2, Panels A and F) and a 2.1-fold higher baseline
level of cellular senescence than MCF7/∆Raf-1(CA) cells
(Figure 2, Panels E & F). However, these MCF7/∆Raf1(CA)DoxR cells displayed a similar induction of
senescence in response to doxorubicin treatment as
MCF7/∆Raf-1(CA) cells (Figure 2, Panels E & F).

Since chemotherapies are commonly administered
in combination with hormonal therapy in ER-positive
breast cancers, we sought to determine if drug resistance
and oncogenic signaling through Akt-1 or Raf-1 effects
induction of cellular senescence in response to 4-hydroxy
tamoxifen (4HT). MCF-7 or MCF7/DoxR cells expressing
constitutively-active Akt-1 or Raf-1 were treated with
10, 50 and 100 nM 4HT for six days then stained for
β-galactosidase activity (Figure 4). Photomicrographs
of the induction of cellular senescence in MCF-7 and
the doxorubicin-resistant cells in response to 4HT or
doxorubicin treatment are presented in Figure 3.
Similar levels of cellular senescence were
observed in MCF-7 and MCF7/DoxR (Panel A) after
4HT treatment, suggesting that mechanisms of drug
resistance are independent of senescence inducted by
4HT. Interestingly, ∆Akt-1(CA) expression did not
prevent cellular senescence induction by 4HT treatment
in the unselected MCF7/∆Akt-1(CA) cells (Panel B), but
potently suppressed senescence in doxorubicin-resistant
MCF7/∆Akt-1(CA)DoxR cells (Panel B). In contrast,
Raf-1 activation in doxorubicin-resistant MCF7/∆Raf1(CA)DoxR cells did not suppress senescence by 4HT
treatment (Panel C). Together, these results suggest that
presence activated PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway in
the presence of acquired drug resistant Raf/MEK/ERK
pathway activation is sufficient to block drug-induced
senescence to both doxorubicin and 4HT.

induces p53 in MCF-7 cells [99]. Lower levels of p53 and
downstream p21Cip-1 were induced in doxorubicin-resistant
MCF-7 cells which also contain activated Akt-1[99]. p53
plays key roles in the regulation of cellular senescence [3840,43-46,110-120], DNA damage response [121-123], cell
cycle progression [124-143], chromosome dynamics [144146], apoptosis [147-151], sensitivity to chemotherapy
[152-154], radiotherapy [107,155] tumorigenesis and
metastasis [53,156-158], metabolism [159-161], cellular
redox [41,162], hypoxia [61,75,136,163,164], autophagy
[49,165,166] and aging [167] as well as other important
biological processes. Often some of the purported functions
of p53 are overlapping and even sometimes contradictory.
p53 is regulated by other transcription factors [168,169],
the proteins ATM [170], MDM2 and MDMX [174-180]
and other interacting proteins [181-187] and miRNAs
[171-173]. Small molecule inhibitors to proteins such
as MDM2 which negatively regulate p53 have been
developed [56,188-190]. Akt-1 can phosphorylate MDM2 which can promote p53 destabilization. Decreased p53
and p21Cip-1 levels may result in less cellular senescence in
response to doxorubicin in the cells containing activated
Akt-1 than in wild type MCF-7 cells.
The target genes of p53 and other members of the p53
family are clearly important in regulating many diverse
processes [191-200]. p21Cip1 can activate pRb which can
regulate entry into replicative senescence [12,201]. p53
also suppresses mTOR [38,40,44], however Akt can
suppress the effects of p53 documenting the complexity of
these pathways in how they regulate senescence induction
[202-204]. miRNAs have also been shown to regulate
critical genes involved in senescence such as pRb, p53,
and PTEN [51,171-173,190,205]. Integrating these
complex and often redundant interactions into a model by
which p53 regulates cellular senescence in MCF-7 cells
remains an ongoing process.
Recently it has been demonstrated by Blagosklonny
and colleagues that the mTOR complex plays a critical
role in regulating senescence and quiescence [3032,38,40,206]. Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin treatment
in the presence of Nutlin-3A, will prevent the induction
of senescence and result in p53-mediated quiescence
[38, 40]. Interestingly, they also observed that inhibiting
mTOR with rapamycin resulted in increased activation of
“upstream” Akt [40]. This induction of Akt could have
resulted from a shift in the equilibrium between mTORC1
and mTORC2, leading to higher levels of mTORC2 which
resulted in Akt activation that prevented the induction of
senescence by a mTORC1-independent mechanism [59].
Other studies by Blagosklonny’s group demonstrated
that knock down of TSC2, a negative upstream regulator of
mTOR, could convert quiescent cells into senescent cells
in the presence of Nutlin-3A [38]. Nutlin-3A is a MDM2
inhibitor, which results in p53 induction (accumulation).
Inhibiting TSC2 resulted in increased mTORC1 activity
which switched the cells from the quiescent into the

Discussion
In our studies, we determined the effects of the
chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin and the hormonal drug
tamoxifen (4HT) on the induction of cellular senescence
in MCF-7 and derivative cell lines which varied in their
levels of activated Akt-1 or Raf-1 expression. Moreover,
we also examined the induction of cellular senescence in
cells which were selected for drug resistance by prolonged
culture in medium containing 25 nM doxorubicin to
determine whether drug resistance would alter the
induction of senescence after either doxorubicin or 4HT
treatment. An advantage of our investigation was that all
cells had the same basic genetic background (MCF-7) and
differed only in the levels of activated Akt-1 or Raf-1, or
their resistance to doxorubicin.
A lower level of senescence was observed after 50
nM doxorubicin treatment of MCF7/DoxR than in MCF7 cells. However, when the cells were treated with 100
nM doxorubicin, similar levels of cellular senescence
were observed. These results demonstrated that the
doxorubicin-resistant MCF7/DoxR wells were more
resistant to the induction of senescence after doxorubicin
treatment than unselected MCF-7 cells. However, the
MCF7/DoxR doxorubicin-resistant phenotype did not
prevent the induction of senescence in response to 4HT
treatment. This indicates that acquired resistance to DNA
damage-induced senescence does not protect against
senescence induced by hormone blockade, and thus the
two are likely to occur through independent signaling
cascades.
While previous studies have shown that
overexpression of either activated Akt-1 or Raf-1 results
in resistance to doxorubicin [2,3,99,100], in our current
work activated Akt-1 and Raf-1 expression have different
effects on the induction of senescence after doxorubicin
treatment. Overexpression of activated Akt-1 resulted in
decreased induction of senescence compared with MCF7 cells after 50 nM doxorubicin treatment. Drug-resistant
MCF7/∆Akt-1[CA]DoxR cells were even more resistant
to the induction of senescence than either MCF7/∆Akt1[CA], MCF7/DoxR or MCF-7 cells (Figure 2). In
contrast, a higher background level of cellular senescence
was observed in untreated MCF7/∆Raf-1(CA) and
MCF7/∆Raf-1(CA)DoxR cells compared to MCF-7 cells.
However, the levels of cellular senescence observed after
100 nM doxorubicin treatment of MCF7/∆Raf-1(CA)
and MCF7/∆Raf-1(CA)DoxR cells were not as high as
observed in MCF-7 cells, suggesting that while there were
higher levels of constitutive senescence in MCF7/∆Raf1(CA) and MCF7/∆Raf-1(CA)DoxR cells, they were
blocked in their ability to undergo as much senescence as
MCF-7 cells.

Doxorubicin induces the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in
MCF-7 cells and higher levels of active ERK are detected
in MCF7/DoxR cells than in drug sensitive MCF-7 cells.
ERK can in some cases phosphorylate p53 (or additional
proteins) and alter its activity. However, this increased
ERK expression does not appear to prevent the induction
of cellular senescence. In fact, a higher as a higher baseline
level of cellular senescence was detected in MCF7/∆Raf1(CA) cells. Thus it can be argued that there is probably
an additional modification(s) besides increased ERK
expression in MCF7/DoxR which results in the decreased
induction of senescence after doxorubicin treatment.
While both MCF7/∆Akt-1(CA) and MCF7/∆Raf-1(CA)
cells display increased resistance to doxorubicin compared
with MCF-7 cells [2,3,100], they varied in terms of
induction of senescence after doxorubicin treatment. Thus
the genetic mechanisms responsible for chemotherapeutic
drug resistance and senescence induction are different.
The ability of 4HT to induce cellular senescence in
breast cancer is not well documented. 4HT likely induces
reactive oxygen species (ROS) which in turn cause DNA
damage and subsequently cellular senescence [211-213].
Similar levels of cellular senescence were observed in
MCF-7 and MCF7/DoxR cells when they were cultured in
medium containing 4HT. Thus the genetic modifications
that occur in MCF7/DoxR cells which allow them to
grow in medium containing 25 nM doxorubicin are not
sufficient to prevent the induction of senescence induced
by 4HT.
Induction of cellular senescence in response to 4HT
differed in these models which expressed activated Akt1(CA) or Raf-1(CA). In the MCF7/∆Akt-1(CA) cells that
had not been selected in doxorubicin, there was more
cellular senescence than in the MCF-7 cells in response
to 4HT treatment (compare in Figure 4 panels A and B).
In contrast, with the MCF7/Akt-1(CA)DoxR cells that
had been selected in doxorubicin, less cellular senescence
in response to 4HT treatment was observed than in all
the other cell lines examined. These results suggest
that doxorubicin-selected drug resistant cells which
overexpress activated Akt-1 are resistant to the induction
of senescence upon 4HT as well as doxorubicin treatment.
As stated previously, the doxorubicin-resistant cells
express higher levels of activated Akt-1 than cells which
have not been selected in doxorubicin. This higher level of
Akt-1 confers increased resistance to 4HT [99,100].
Activated Raf-1 did not appear to suppress the
induction of cellular senescence in response to 4HT
treatment. Although in general, relatively constant levels
of cellular senescence were observed in MCF7/∆Raf1(CA) and MCF7/∆Raf-1(CA)DoxR cells in response to
4HT treatment as was seen after doxorubicin treatment of
these cells. Taken together with the results observed with
MCF7/DoxR cells, which express high levels of activated
ERK, it is likely that increased levels of the Raf/MEK/
ERK pathway does not inhibit the induction of cellular

senescent phenotype.
The effects of Akt on the induction of cellular
senescence remain controversial. Often abnormal
oncogene expression or tumor suppressor gene deletion
(PTEN, NF1 or RB) has been associated with “oncogene
induced senescence” (OIS) which can be viewed as a
protective mechanism to prevent tumor development
[80,101]. However, recently it has been observed that Akt
activation can suppress the senescence induced by mutant
Ras signaling to promote tumorigenesis [207]. In this
system, mutations at PI3K/Akt accelerated tumorigenesis
potentially by bypassing the senescence induced by the
activated Ras.
Activating mutations at oncogenes in the EGFR/Ras/
PI3K/Akt pathway do not always result in OIS. AKT1,
FGFR3, PIK3CA, KRAS, HRAS, and EGFR mutations
have been found in some benign Seborrheic keratosis
tumors which are not associated with increased cellular
senescence. Interesting mutations in tumor suppressor
genes TSC1 and PTEN were not observed in this study
[208].
Inhibition of Akt activity can also have effects
resulting in the induction of senescence. Pharmacological
suppression of Akt activity in combination with vitamin
D3 can synergistically inhibit growth and result in the
induction of senescence in prostate cancer cells [209]. This
research demonstrates that quenching the effects of Akt
can result in the induction of senescence. Expression of
an inducible Akt gene suppressed temozolomide-induced
Chk2 activation and G2 arrest and senescence in a glioma
cell line model [210]. These studies indicate the protective
effects of Akt with regards to certain chemotherapeutic
drug treatments and support our findings that constitutive
activation of Akt-1 can prevent the induction of senescence
in MCF-7 cells after doxorubicin treatment.
Previously we have determined that there are higher
levels of activated Akt-1 in the drug resistant cell line
MCF7/ΔAkt-1ER*(Myr+)DoxR compared with MCF7/
ΔAkt-1ER*(Myr+) cells which had not been selected
for doxorubicin- or hormonal-resistance [99]. Growth
in medium containing either doxorubicin or 4HT selects
for ∆Akt-1(CA)-infected cells, as higher levels of Akt-1
expression provides a selective growth advantage in the
presence of these drugs [99].
We have also shown that introduction of mutated
forms of PTEN into MCF-7 cells which lacked lipid and
protein phosphatase activity also suppressed the ability
of doxorubicin to induce cellular senescence [5]. These
cells which express the PTEN mutants were also more
drug resistant than MCF-7 cells and also overexpressed
activated Akt [5]. The PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR and
Raf/MEK/ERK pathways differed in their abilities to
modulate the induction of cellular senescence in response
to doxorubicin treatment in breast cancer cells as activated
Akt-1 impeded senescence while activated Raf-1 did not,
similar to the results of the present study.

senescence induced by either 4HT or doxorubicin.
In some cases, the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway
may induce cellular senescence [27,214-218]. Ras can
activate both the Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/
mTOR pathways [6-8,59,60]. Other investigators have
demonstrated that sustained Ras activation in endothelial
cells can result in autonomous growth and senescence
bypass and alter the differentiation status [219]. However,
this altered phenotype was demonstrated to be regulated
by the PI3K/Akt pathway.
These results have clinical significance as the PI3K/
PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway is often activated in breast
cancer by mutations at PIK3CA and dysregulation of
PTEN. Thus this pathway and downstream substrates such
as the transcription factor Twist are critically involved in
breast cancer and are targets for improved therapy [220222]. Furthermore, drug resistance frequently develops in
breast cancer after chemo- or hormonal-based therapies.
Akt is frequently activated by upstream PIK3CA or
PTEN mutations or gene silencing. PTEN can be mutated
or silenced by various mechanisms in human cancer.
Mutations occur which either delete the PTEN gene or
alter its activity. These mutations which result in activated
Akt expression may have effects on the induction of
cellular senescence in response to chemotherapeutic
drugs currently used to treat breast cancer patients.
Our studies also indicate that just because a cell is drug
resistant, that does not mean that it will be resistant to the
induction of cellular senescence by a chemotherapeutic
drug. Doxorubicin induced cell cycle arrest in the G2/M
phase in both MCF7/∆Raf-1 and MCF7/Akt-1 cells, yet
these cells differed in the extent of cellular senescence
after doxorubicin treatment. Clearly cell cycle regulatory
proteins play key roles in regulation of cellular senescence
[223]. Other studies have shown that certain proteins such
as p21Cip-1 are required in some cells for the induction of
senescence but not for cell cycle arrest in response to
HDAC inhibitors such as sodium butyrate [224]. Together
these studies point to the complexities of drug resistance
and cellular senescence.

5 x 105 MCF-7 cells were plated into 6-well cell
culture plates (BD Biosciences, Mountainview, CA) and
one day later infected with a retrovirus containing the
various plasmid DNAs as described [3,5,99,100,109]. The
nomenclature of the transfected cells is MCF7/ followed
by the name of the introduced plasmid DNA. Stably
transfected/infected cells were isolated by culture in
medium containing 2 mg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Invitrogen).

Cellular Senescence Assay
Senescent cells were identified by a senescence
associated (SA) β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) assay as
described [109].
