Abstract
Aberrant expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) is a common characteristic of many cancers, including
non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and ovarian cancer. Although EGFR is
currently a favorite molecular target for the treatment of these
cancers, inhibition of the receptor with small-molecule inhibitors (i.e., erlotinib) or monoclonal antibodies (i.e., cetuximab) does not provide long-term therapeutic beneﬁt as standalone treatment. Interestingly, we have found that addition of
erlotinib to photodynamic therapy (PDT) can improve treatment response in typically erlotinib-resistant NSCLC tumor
xenografts. Ninety-day complete response rates of 63% are
achieved when erlotinib is administered in three doses before
PDT of H460 human tumor xenografts, compared with 16%
after PDT-alone. Similar beneﬁt is found when erlotinib is

added to PDT of A549 NCSLC xenografts. Improved response
is accompanied by increased vascular shutdown, and erlotinib
increases the in vitro cytotoxicity of PDT to endothelial cells.
Tumor uptake of the photosensitizer (benzoporphyrin derivative monoacid ring A; BPD) is increased by the in vivo administration of erlotinib; nevertheless, this elevation of BPD levels
only partially accounts for the beneﬁt of erlotinib to PDT. Thus,
pretreatment with erlotinib augments multiple mechanisms of
PDT effect that collectively lead to large improvements in
therapeutic efﬁcacy. These data demonstrate that short-duration administration of erlotinib before PDT can greatly improve
the responsiveness of even erlotinib-resistant tumors to treatment. Results will inform clinical investigation of EGFR-targeting therapeutics in conjunction with PDT. Cancer Res; 75(15);

Introduction

mutations tend to be more sensitive to EGFR-targeted therapy,
whereas tumors that exhibit KRAS mutations respond poorly;
and while some tumor types are initially sensitive to EGFR
inhibition, others will acquire resistance, leaving patients with
limited treatment options (1, 3). Thus, while EGFR has gained
favor as a molecular target for treating several types of tumors,
inhibition of the receptor as standalone treatment does not
consistently yield clinically positive results.
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a combination of light,
photosensitizer, and oxygen to inﬂict cell damage. Combinations of PDT with drugs that target EGFR suggest that multimodality therapy can increase cytotoxicity (4, 5). EGFR targeting of photosensitizer reduces cell proliferation after PDT
(6), and anti-EGFR antibodies and small-molecular inhibitors
can increase apoptosis and/or inhibit proliferation in tumors
or cell cultures that are treated with PDT (7–10). Therapeutic
beneﬁt has been shown in combinations of PDT with cetuximab in tumor models of ovarian, nasopharyngeal, and
bladder cancer (7–9). Such results have stimulated clinical
interest in combining EGFR inhibition with PDT, but the
mechanisms that underlie this added therapeutic beneﬁt are
poorly understood.
The goals of this study are 2-fold. First, we establish the
therapeutic efﬁcacy of adding erlotinib, a small-molecule inhibitor of EGFR, before PDT of NSCLC human tumor xenografts.
Erlotinib is an oral drug, so pre-PDT administration is translatable
to intraoperative delivery of PDT, where oral drug administration
to patients in the intensive care unit postoperatively is not
feasible. Second, we have elucidated the mechanisms by which

A leading characteristic of aggressive tumors is aberrant
expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a
signaling protein involved in promoting cell proliferation,
angiogenesis, and survival. Several EGFR-inhibiting drugs are
used to treat malignancies such as non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC), and breast cancer (1, 2). These drugs include
EGFR-targeting antibodies (i.e., cetuximab) and small-molecule inhibitors (e.g., geﬁtinib and erlotinib). The efﬁcacy of
EGFR inhibition varies based on the molecular characteristics
of the tumor. For example, tumors harboring EGFR-activating

Erlotinib Pretreatment Improves PDT

response is improved using this protocol. The effects of erlotinib
on PDT-induced tumor cytotoxicity, endothelial cell damage, and
vascular function have been determined and studied for their
contribution to long-term PDT responsiveness. These ﬁndings
provide insights that will inform the clinical development of
treatment regimens that incorporate targeting of EGFR with PDT.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
EGFR wild-type, KRAS-mutant human NSCLC cell lines, H460
and A549, were obtained from the ATCC. H460-mCherry cells
and SVEC (immortalized mouse endothelial cells) were provided
by Drs. Jay Dorsey (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA)
and Bin Chen (University of the Sciences, Philadelphia, PA),
respectively. Cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 (H460, SVEC)
or DMEM (A549) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. All cell lines were authenticated
by and conﬁrmed as Mycoplasma free using the Cell Check Plus
authentication service from IDEXX Bioresearch (May 2014).
Tumor models
Tumors were propagated by intradermal injection of 1  106
cells over the right shoulder of female nude mice (Athymic,
Ncr-nu/nu; National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD). Studies
were initiated when tumors reached diameters of 6 to 8 mm.
Investigations were approved by the University of Pennsylvania
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee; animal facilities
are Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care accredited.

Phosphorescence lifetime oximetry
Phosphorescence lifetime-based measurements of tumor oxygenation were performed as described previously (11) using
intratumoral injection of the probe Oxyphor G4 (20 mmol/L).
Erlotinib was administered on a triple-dose schedule. Tumor pO2
was measured before erlotinib (50 mg/kg) administration on each
day and then at 3 hours after the ﬁnal dose (corresponding to
measurements at 0, 24, 48, and 51 hours relative to the ﬁrst dose of
erlotinib). Phosphorescence lifetime oximetry is based on variations in the probe phosphorescence decay time due to quenching
of the probe triplet state by oxygen. The measured quantity
(phosphorescence lifetime) is dependent on the concentration
of oxygen, but not upon the concentration of the probe, the
excitation light intensity or signal collection efﬁciency. Data
represent the average of multiple measurements that were taken
at different locations on the tumor.
Flow cytometry
Treated or control H460-mCherry tumors (2–5 pooled/condition) were excised and studied for the presence of treatmentinduced apoptosis (labeled by Annexin V) and necrosis (labeled
by DAPI). The staining protocol is detailed in Supplementary
Materials and Methods. Samples were analyzed on a LSRII Flow
Cytometer using Diva software (Becton Dickinson). Data were
analyzed in FlowJo (TreeStar).

PDT
Animals received benzoporphyrin derivative monoacid ring A
(BPD, Visudyne; QLT Ophthalmics), at 1 mg/kg (i.v.), 3 hours
before light delivery (690  5 nm). Light from a diode laser (B&W
Tek, Inc.) was delivered through microlens-tipped ﬁbers (Pioneer)
to produce a 1 cm diameter ﬁeld of uniform intensity. Laser
output was measured (LabMaster power meter; Coherent) and
adjusted to produce a ﬂuence rate of 75 mW/cm2 at the tumor
surface. A ﬂuence of 135 J/cm2 was delivered, during which mice
were anesthetized by inhalation of isoﬂurane in medical air
(VetEquip anesthesia machine).

In vivo imaging
To detect BPD, animals were imaged 3 hours after BPD
injection. For perfusion imaging, IRDye800 PEG (LI-COR) was
administered i.v. 15 to 30 minutes before imaging at 1, 4, and
18 hours after PDT. Imaging was performed on a LI-COR Pearl
Impulse using white light, 700 nm, and 800 nm to visualize
anatomy, BPD, and IRDye800, respectively. For analysis, similarly sized tumor and ﬂank-identifying regions of interest
(ROI) were drawn on the white light images and applied to
the near-infrared images. Data are expressed as average ﬂuorescence intensity (FI)/unit area, and for IRDye800 images, data
are normalized to the ﬂank in order to provide for individual
standardization of dye circulation. For scab measurements,
ROIs were drawn around scab-containing areas in the white
light images, and data are expressed as the number of pixels in
the scab (or the pre-PDT tumor).

Anti-EGFR and anti-VEGF treatment
PDT was combined with erlotinib (Tarceva, Genentech) or
bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech). Erlotinib (50 mg/kg) was
administered (oral gavage) at either 3 hours before PDT (single
dose) or at 2 days, 1 day, and 3 hours before PDT (triple dose).
Dosing was chosen from pilot studies in which 50 mg/kg was
efﬁcacious in the absence of toxicities, whereas higher doses (up to
100 mg/kg) resulted in dramatic weight loss in the animals.
Bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) was administered via intraperitoneal
injection at 2 days, 1 day, and 3 hours before PDT.

ELISA
Tumor-localized concentrations of human VEGF were assayed
by ELISA (R&D Systems). Excised tumors were immediately
frozen in a slurry of dry ice and 70% ethanol, then homogenized
on dry ice and resuspended in cold 1 PBS. Vortexed samples
were freeze-thawed (three times), centrifuged, and protein concentrations of cleared lysates were detected using BCA reagent
(Thermo Scientiﬁc). The manufacturer's protocols were subsequently followed. Plates were analyzed using SoftMax Pro software (Molecular Devices).

Tumor response assays
After treatment, animals were followed daily to assess longterm outcome. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula
volume ¼ diameter  width2  p/6. Animals were euthanized
when tumor volume exceeded its pretreatment measurement or at
90 days after PDT in the absence of tumor recurrence (i.e.,
complete response).

Western blot analysis
EGFR expression in lysed solutions of SVEC, H460, and A549
cells was conﬁrmed by Western blotting. Probing with anti-EGFR
antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) was performed overnight
on equivalent amounts of protein electrophoresed on BIS–Tris
NuPage gels (Life Technologies) and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes. Anti-b-actin antibody was used as a loading control.

Details on the staining protocol are provided in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.
AlamarBlue assay
Viability/proliferation was assessed in cells that were either left
untreated or exposed to erlotinib-alone, light-alone, BPD-alone,
DMSO-alone, PDT-alone, or erlotinib/PDT. Speciﬁc to the condition studied, cells were pretreated with 4 mmol/L erlotinib 2
days before PDT. The following day (1 day pre-PDT), cells were
reseeded into black-walled 96-well plates (4 wells/condition),
and incubated overnight. On the day of PDT, BPD (100 ng/mL)
and/or erlotinib (4 mmol/L) were added for a 3-hour incubation,
cells were illuminated (5 mW/cm2, 0.5 J/cm2), and replacement
medium was added that contained a low dose (1 mmol/L) of
erlotinib (accounting for cell exposure to erlotinib in the short
term after PDT in vivo). At 20 hours after PDT, the medium was
replaced with alamarBlue-containing medium (cells were not
reseeded) and the plate was read every hour up to 25 hours after
PDT. A 5-hour incubation in alamarBlue reagent produced a
strong but unsaturated signal, thus viability was assessed at the
25-hour time point per the manufacturer's protocol. Data are
expressed as viability relative to untreated controls.
In vitro BPD uptake
Cells were incubated with 4 mmol/L erlotinib at 2 days, 1 day,
and 3 hours before their extraction. BPD (100 ng/mL) was
included with the ﬁnal addition of erlotinib. After 3 hours, cells
were washed 2 in Cell Rinse (0.1 mol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L KCl,
1 mmol/L NaH2PO4, 6 mmol/L glucose, 20 mmol/L HEPES, pH
7.2), extracted in 1% SDS, passed through a 30 g needle two to
three times to shear the DNA, and stored frozen (20 C). For
analysis, samples were heated (50 C), diluted in PBS, and read on
a Fluoromax-4 spectroﬂuorometer (Horiba Scientiﬁc) with excitation at 405 nm. Peak emission between 688 and 693 nm was
determined and BPD concentration was calculated by comparison with a standard curve. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA assay (Pierce) and data are expressed as BPD
uptake per unit protein.
Bilirubin tests
Animals received either single- or triple-dose erlotinib treatment. Three hours after the ﬁnal erlotinib dose was administered,
anesthetized animals underwent a terminal cardiac puncture.
Blood coagulated at room temperature (20 minutes), and
plasma was collected by centrifugation and frozen (20 C).
Bilirubin content was analyzed by Antech Diagnostics.
Clonogenic assay
Following the protocol used in the alamarBlue assay, cells that
were untreated, as well as those that were erlotinib and/or PDTtreated, were plated at deﬁned concentrations and incubated to
permit colony formation (7 days). Tests of a single "dose" of
erlotinib were performed as a 3 hour erlotinib exposure before
PDT. A slightly higher light dose (0.8 J/cm2) was used for clonogenics due to the more protracted time course of this assay.
Surviving fractions were calculated relative to the plating efﬁcacy
of cells exposed to neither erlotinib nor PDT.
Statistical analysis
Means and standard errors are reported in ﬁgures. The Student t
tests (JMP, SAS Institute, Inc.) were used to assess differences in

3120 Cancer Res; 75(15) August 1, 2015

means between groups, with paired tests used where noted.
Tumor response data were described using the Kaplan–Meier
method, yielding median regrowth times, and 95% conﬁdence
intervals (95% CI) noting that in some cases the upper bound was
undetermined. We ﬁt a Cox model to the data and determined
differences in median survival between groups based on a Wald
test. A post-hoc test for trend was used to determine whether
median survival increased as a function of erlotinib dose (zero,
one, or three doses). Hypothesis tests were one-sided for the
tumor response data, as there was no scientiﬁc interest in determining whether treatment reduced response, and two-sided for all
other hypothesis tests. The type I error rate was 0.05.

Results
Erlotinib improves therapeutic response and enhances
shutdown of the tumor vasculature after PDT
We ﬁrst considered the therapeutic effect of erlotinib administration before PDT. At 2 days, 1 day, and 3 hours before light
delivery, erlotinib was administered to mice bearing H460 tumors
(Fig. 1A). All animals treated with erlotinib regrew their tumors in
less than 1 day (i.e., no tumor regression occurred). In mice treated
with PDT, median time-to-regrowth was 11 days (95% CI, 5–29
days), and impressively, pretreatment with erlotinib increased the
median time-to-regrowth to over 90 days after PDT (P < 0.001
compared with PDT). This was accompanied by an increase in
90-day complete response rate from 16% (PDT) to 63% (erlotinib/PDT). Erlotinib similarly improved response in mice bearing
A549 tumors (Fig. 1B). Pretreatment with erlotinib increased
median time-to-regrowth to 69 days versus 8 days in animals
that received PDT (P ¼ 0.033). This was reﬂected in an increase in
90-day complete response rate from 15% (PDT) to 51% (erlotinib/PDT).
These ﬁndings identify exceptional improvements in therapeutic outcome as a consequence of adding erlotinib to PDT. The
results were far superior to the beneﬁt that was expected from our
previous in vitro work in which erlotinib augmented the cytotoxic
effect of PDT by <1 log of kill (12). As such, we considered the
potential contribution of in vivo–speciﬁc factors to tumor
response with erlotinib/PDT. Others have reported short duration
treatment with erlotinib to increase tumor oxygenation (13),
which could improve the in vivo effectiveness of PDT relative to
in vitro ﬁndings (for which oxygen limitation is not an issue). To
test for this, tumor oxygenation was measured after the administration of erlotinib. Compared with baseline values in each
tumor, no appreciable increases in oxygenation were observed
after erlotinib administration (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Flow cytometry was performed to study the nature and time
course of treatment-induced cytotoxicity (Supplementary
Fig. S2). In agreement with tumor response results, erlotinib was
minimally cytotoxic to H460 tumors. When used as a single agent,
erlotinib induced only small, insigniﬁcant increases in apoptosis
(augmented by the addition of PDT) that did not affect overall
viability. In the absence of PDT, erlotinib did not induce necrosis.
Moreover, these data revealed erlotinib-mediated increases in
PDT cytotoxicity at delayed (18 hours), but not early (1 hours)
time points after treatment. This time course is consistent with
PDT cytotoxicity secondary to in vivo microenvironmental
effects, such as vascular damage, and led us to next evaluate the
contribution of vascular effects to the erlotinib-enhanced PDT
response.

Addition of erlotinib to BPD-PDT improves therapeutic response of mice
bearing NSCLC tumor xenografts. A, response of H460 tumors to erlotinib
(n ¼ 6), BPD-PDT (n ¼ 19), or erlotinib/BPD-PDT (n ¼ 27). B, response of
A549 tumors (n ¼ 7–11) to the same conditions. Three daily doses of erlotinib
were administered prior to PDT. Tumor regrowth was monitored up to 90
days after PDT. For B, a long-term survivor of PDT was euthanized (tumorfree) at 36 days due to unrelated illness.

Erlotinib reduces acute PDT-induced VEGF secretion, but
without therapeutic consequence
EGFR inhibition can decrease the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a protein critical for reestablishment
of damaged vasculature (15). Like other cancer therapies, PDT can
induce increases in VEGF that contribute to tumor recurrence after
treatment (16–18). Therefore, if erlotinib attenuates PDT-induced
increases in VEGF, we might expect these decreases to contribute
to the stronger vascular response in tumors pretreated with
erlotinib. Indeed, PDT produced large increases in tumor concentrations of H460-produced (human) VEGF (Fig. 3A). Pretreatment with erlotinib signiﬁcantly abrogated this effect and VEGF
levels were barely elevated after PDT. PDT of A549 tumors led
to even larger increases in human VEGF that were reduced nearly
2-fold when erlotinib was given before PDT (Supplementary
Fig. S4).
To assess if abrogation of VEGF in the early time course after
PDT is responsible for augmentation of PDT response by erlotinib, we investigated whether inhibition of extracellular VEGF
resulted in similar improvements in PDT response. To accomplish
this, we substituted a clinically approved antibody that speciﬁcally targets VEGF, bevacizumab, for erlotinib. These studies
followed the rationale that if reduction of extracellular VEGF was
responsible for mediating vascular shutdown after treatment with
erlotinib/PDT, then bevacizumab/PDT would result in similarly
robust vascular shutdown. The H460 tumor model was used
because in this model the administration of erlotinib provided
complete abrogation of PDT-induced increases in VEGF. Pre-PDT
administration of bevacizumab reduced VEGF levels in H460
tumors after PDT below those observed in untreated controls
(Fig. 3A). However, despite the dramatic reduction of VEGF in
H460 tumors as a result of the pre-PDT addition of bevacizumab,
no enhanced vascular damage was observed after PDT (Fig. 3B). In
contrast to improvements in tumor response after treatment with
erlotinib/PDT (see Fig. 1A), pretreatment with bevacizumab
yielded no improvement and all tumors regrew within 26 days
of illumination (median 10 days; data not shown).

Near-infrared in vivo imaging of tumor perfusion was used to
study the antivascular effects of adding erlotinib to the pre-PDT
regimen. In vivo imaging incorporated signal that originated
mostly from the tumor vasculature, but unavoidably included
signal from overlying skin, and, to some extent, underlying tissue.
Thus, we compared in vivo to ex vivo imaging of tumors in order to
conﬁrm that in vivo imaging was representative of the tumorspeciﬁc signal (obtained by ex vivo imaging). The data obtained
from ex vivo and in vivo images were extremely well correlated
(Supplementary Fig. S3), validating use of in vivo imaging to study
tumor vascular response.
By in vivo imaging, we could identify localized increases in
dye accumulation, indicative of a hyper-permeable state that is
characteristic after PDT (14), as well as dye exclusion that
demonstrates impairment of tumor blood ﬂow. PDT of
H460 tumors produced a hyper-permeable state at 1 hour that
was followed at 4 and 18 hours by the progressive development
of dye-excluding vascular damage (Fig. 2). In both H460 and
A549 tumors (Fig. 2, inset), there was signiﬁcantly greater dye

Erlotinib increases endothelial cytotoxicity after PDT
To further consider the mechanisms of erlotinib-mediated
augmentation of PDT vascular damage, the direct cytotoxic
action of erlotinib/PDT on endothelial cells was studied. The
viability of mouse endothelial cells (SVEC) was compared after
treatment with erlotinib, PDT, or the combination. Prior to
initiation of these experiments, EGFR expression by SVEC was
conﬁrmed by Western blot analyses and was detected at similar
levels as were observed in the NSCLC tumor lines studied
(Supplementary Fig. S5). SVEC viability was signiﬁcantly
reduced by PDT and erlotinib, as well as by the erlotinib/PDT
combination (Fig. 4A). Moreover, erlotinib pretreatment before
PDT signiﬁcantly increased the cytotoxic effect of PDT.
A mechanism by which erlotinib could increase PDT cytotoxicity is through the capability of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) to augment photosensitizer retention. This is mediated
via their inhibition of drug transport by ABCG2 (ATP-binding
cassette transporter G2). TKIs act through this mechanism to
increase tumor levels of several photosensitizers, although BPD
is typically less affected (19). Indeed, we previously found no

To elucidate whether erlotinib-induced increases in photosensitizer uptake were of signiﬁcance in vivo, the ﬂuorescence intensity of BPD in H460 tumors was directly measured by in vivo
optical imaging at 700 nm. Fluorescence intensity at 700 nm
increased by approximately 50% when animals were pretreated
with erlotinib. With erlotinib pretreatment, BPD levels were also
elevated in the ﬂanks of the animals, indicating a more systemic
impact of erlotinib on photosensitizer uptake (Fig. 5A). More-

over, similar elevations were detected in A549 tumors (Supplementary Fig. S6).
The contribution of erlotinib-induced increases in BPD uptake
to therapeutic response was tested using an alternative schedule of
erlotinib dosing. We found that in contrast to the triple-dosing
schedule, a single dose of erlotinib given immediately before BPD
administration did not increase BPD uptake (Fig. 5B). This ﬁnding
may reﬂect the known induction of hepatic side effects by erlotinib
(common among TKIs; refs. 20, 21) because patients with mild
hepatic dysfunction exhibit increases in the plasma half-life of BPD
(22). Indeed, we found that bilirubin, a breakdown product of
heme catabolism whose elevation is associated with liver dysfunction, was ﬁve times higher in the plasma of mice given three doses
of erlotinib (1.03 mg/dL  0.17) than in untreated controls (0.21
mg/dL  0.03). In contrast, a single dose of erlotinib administered
3 hours before PDT (before BPD administration) caused only a
small increase in bilirubin concentration (Fig. 5C).

Thus, a single dose of erlotinib did not alter tumor BPD levels.
Yet, importantly, a single dose of erlotinib does increase PDTinduced cytotoxicity to SVEC, indicating that a single dose is
adequate at a molecular level to augment cell death from PDT
(Supplementary Fig. S7). From these results, we hypothesized that
treatment with a single erlotinib dose would produce little
improvement in tumor response compared with PDT-alone if
erlotinib-induced increases in BPD uptake were the sole mechanism of enhanced tumor response. Conversely, if the causative
mechanisms included other factors in addition to enhanced BPD
uptake, then the single-dose erlotinib schedule should yield a
tumor response that is intermediate to the effects of treatment
with PDT and with erlotinib/PDT on a triple-dose schedule. Our
data support the second hypothesis. A log-rank test for trend
indicated an increasing median regrowth time for triple-dose
erlotinib/PDT, followed by single-dose erlotinib/PDT and lastly
PDT-alone (P ¼ 0.009; Table 1). Speciﬁcally, treatment with PDT
after a single dose of erlotinib yielded a median regrowth time of
21 days (95% CI of 10 days and undetermined), a value that was
signiﬁcantly lower than regrowth time after a triple-dose erlotinib
schedule (median of >90 days; P ¼ 0.042) and higher than
regrowth time after PDT-alone (median of 11 days; P ¼
0.053). Because response to erlotinib/PDT on a single-dose
schedule is independent of an elevation in BPD levels, these data
show that the therapeutic action of erlotinib/PDT includes factors
other than photosensitizer uptake, such as erlotinib-induced
augmentation of PDT vascular response.
Efﬁcacy is not at the expense of selectivity
Because erlotinib-induced enhancement of photosensitizer
levels partly contributes to tumor response, and because erlotinib
led to general increases in BPD levels, we lastly considered the
selectivity of PDT when preceded by erlotinib dosing. Irrespective
of whether the animal received erlotinib, scabs that developed 18
to 30 hours after PDT encompassed areas that were smaller than
their pre-PDT tumor sizes (Fig. 6). Thus, the addition of erlotinib
to PDT did not promote a nonselective reaction. However, the
PDT-induced scabs on animals that received erlotinib/PDT were
larger than those on animals that received PDT. Accordingly, they
involved a larger area of the treated tumor (without nonselectively
extending beyond it), which corroborates the beneﬁt that erlotinib pretreatment provided to tumor response to PDT.

Discussion
Combinations of molecular targeting agents with chemotherapy or radiation are under investigation, especially in treatment of
NSCLC (23, 24), following the premise that addition of these
agents to standard therapies could provide a multifaceted treatment approach (25). Similar to other therapies, there exists a
beneﬁt to combining PDT with molecular targeting (26, 27).
EGFR inhibition using receptor-targeting antibodies and smallmolecule inhibitors can increase the cytotoxicity of PDT against
tumor cells in vitro and reduce tumor burden after PDT in vivo
(7–10, 28). Furthermore, molecular targeting can be used for
photosensitizer delivery through the integration of photosensitizers into antibody (e.g., cetuximab)-coated nanoparticles or by
coupling of antibodies or molecular targeting agents (e.g., erlotinib) directly to a photosensitizer (29–34). In this way, molecular
targeting is exploited to both increase the selectivity of PDT and
augment its cytotoxicity. These studies, together with our current
work, demonstrate great potential in combining PDT with molecular targeting agents to improve therapeutic outcomes. They
emphasize a need to discern the mechanisms that drive improvements in PDT response, toward the goal of informing translation
into clinical protocols.
When erlotinib was used as a standalone treatment, it
completely failed to affect tumor growth compared with control;
indeed, failure rates were identical in the two groups. In contrast,
when combined with PDT, erlotinib signiﬁcantly improved therapeutic outcomes in H460 and A549 tumors, and the effect was

larger than PDT alone. The combined effect was, thus, by deﬁnition synergistic in nature. Both H460 and A459 cells are relatively
resistant to erlotinib (35), although it is reported that a 3-week
dosing schedule can produce tumor growth delay in vivo (36). This
schedule is more prolonged than the triple-dose pre-PDT schedule
that we used, which may account for the standalone effect of
erlotinib. Effectiveness can increase at higher doses, but 100 mg/
kg is the maximum-tolerated dose (36) and we found it to be
associated with morbidities. Thus, the present studies were conducted at an erlotinib dose of 50 mg/kg, which was well tolerated
by the animals.
One mechanism by which erlotinib enhances tumor response
to PDT appears to be through the augmentation of PDT vascular
effects. Vascular damage contributes to PDT response with many
treatment regimens (37, 38). In BPD-PDT, acute vascular shutdown occurs when treatment is performed at short drug-light
intervals (e.g., 15 minutes; refs. 38, 39). Yet, longer drug–light
intervals are associated with venodilation (40), followed by
reduced perfusion at delayed time points (41, 42). For example,
a 50% reduction in tumor perfusion is reported at 6 hours after
BPD-PDT with a 3-hour drug–light interval (41). On the basis of
in vivo imaging of a perfusion marker, we ﬁnd no decrease in
tumor perfusion at 4 hours after PDT and an approximately 35%
decrease at 18 hours, compared with controls. Erlotinib pretreatment augmented vascular effects, producing a 65% reduction in
perfusion at 18 hours after PDT. Enhancement of PDT-induced
vascular effects by erlotinib may be a result of endothelial cell
damage. EGFR inhibition can reduce the proliferation (43) and
promote apoptosis (44) of endothelial cells in tumors. We found
that erlotinib reduced the viability of endothelial cells after PDT
compared with PDT or EGFR inhibition as monotherapies. These
results suggest that EGFR inhibition can increase the cytotoxicity
of PDT to endothelial cells, thereby contributing to the vasculardamaging effects of BPD-PDT. Thus, our ﬁndings uniquely identify the tumor vasculature as an important target when erlotinib is
administered in the pre-PDT time course.
Another mechanism for erlotinib's effect on PDT response
stems from observations that TKIs can improve photosensitizer
uptake (19). Indeed, we found that erlotinib augmentation of
PDT cytotoxicity to endothelial cells was accompanied by small
but signiﬁcant increases in BPD uptake. A triple-dose erlotinib
schedule also increased in vivo uptake of BPD, but BPD uptake was
minimally affected when the dosing schedule was shorted to a
single erlotinib dose. When combined with in vivo PDT, a single
erlotinib dose was not as effective as the triple-dose schedule, but
still provided for better outcomes than if PDT was performed
alone. Single doses of erlotinib also remained effective in augmenting PDT cytotoxicity to endothelial cells. Thus, these data
suggest that changes in photosensitizer uptake are one component, but not the sole contributor to erlotinib's effect in PDT.
Other potential mechanisms were also explored for the therapeutic beneﬁt of erlotinib to PDT. For example, tumor blood
ﬂow can improve after TKI therapy (13, 45), which could potentially beneﬁt oxygenation and PDT response. However, erlotinib

Erlotinib Pretreatment Improves PDT

did not improve oxygenation of H460 tumors in our studies, nor
in the models recently published by others (46). EGFR inhibition
can also reduce tumor VEGF levels (47), and, in agreement, we
found erlotinib pretreatment to reduce PDT-induced acute
increases in VEGF. Use of antiangiogenic agents after PDT to
decrease VEGF production is associated with better long-term
tumor response (16, 26, 48). However, typical combinations of
antiangiogenics with PDT include prolonged, post-PDT administration of these drugs, not the exclusive pre-PDT administration
of drug that was used in this study. To inform if therapeutic
outcome was aided by decreases in extracellular VEGF in the early
post-PDT time course, we used pre-PDT administration of bevacizumab. Results demonstrated that tumor VEGF levels were
reduced by bevacizumab in the 18 hours after PDT, but without
beneﬁt to long-term PDT response. These results are not in
opposition to favorable reports of combining antiangiogenics
with PDT due to the pre-PDT and short time course of drug
delivery in our studies. However, they do suggest that decreases in
extracellular VEGF in the immediate time frame of PDT cannot
account for the therapeutic beneﬁt of pretreatment with erlotinib.
Toward the goal of clinical translation, the short pre-PDT time
course of erlotinib administration in this study provides a number
of beneﬁts. First, a pre-PDT schedule of erlotinib could be adapted
to clinical trials of intraoperative PDT, where it is difﬁcult to
administer oral agents to postoperative patients who are intubated.
In addition, compared with typical long-term erlotinib dosing, an
abbreviated schedule may avoid erlotinib side effects of skin rash
and diarrhea, which typically develop in the ﬁrst month (49).
Limited use of erlotinib could further avoid the development of
acquired resistance to TKIs that is prevalent with long-term drug use
(50). Consequently, an abbreviated dosing schedule might minimize the incidence of adverse events and prevent acquired resistance, thereby improving patient quality of life compared with
more typical schedules of erlotinib administration.
In conclusion, these studies uniquely investigate the pre-PDT
administration of erlotinib in a clinically relevant regimen for
adding molecular targeting to intraoperative PDT. Given the
prevalence of tumor resistance to molecular targeting drugs,
studies were conducted in erlotinib-resistant tumor models. Nevertheless, we ﬁnd that short-term pre-PDT administration of

erlotinib produces large improvements in PDT outcome. Multiple
mechanisms are responsible for this effect, including erlotinib
sensitization of the tumor vasculature to PDT and an erlotinibinduced increase in tumor accumulation of BPD. Given the
multiple actions of erlotinib on PDT response and the large
magnitude of its effect on this response, these ﬁndings suggest
a signiﬁcant potential for PDT with pre-administration of erlotinib in the treatment of NSCLC and other types of malignancies.
