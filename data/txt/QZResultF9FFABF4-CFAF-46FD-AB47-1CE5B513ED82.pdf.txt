Abstract
Asparagine deamidation in peptides or in fibronectin fragments containing the asparagine-glycine-arginine sequence
generates isoaspartate-glycine-arginine (isoDGR), a new AvB3
integrin-binding motif. Because AvB3 is expressed in angiogenic vessels, we hypothesized that isoDGR-containing peptides could be exploited as ligands for targeted delivery
of drugs to tumor neovasculature. We found that a cyclic
CisoDGRC peptide coupled to fluorescent nanoparticles
(quantum dots) could bind AvB3 integrin and colocalize with
anti-CD31, anti-AvB3, and anti-A5B1 antibodies in human
renal cell carcinoma tissue sections, indicating that this
peptide could efficiently recognize endothelial cells of
angiogenic vessels. Using CisoDGRC fused to tumor necrosis
factor A (TNF) we observed that ultralow doses (1–10 pg) of
this product (called isoDGR-TNF), but not of TNF or CDGRCTNF fusion protein, were sufficient to induce antitumor effects
when administered alone or in combination with chemotherapy to tumor-bearing mice. The antitumor activity of isoDGRTNF was efficiently inhibited by coadministration with an
excess of free CisoDGRC, as expected for ligand-directed
targeting mechanisms. These results suggest that isoDGR is a
novel tumor vasculature–targeting motif. Peptides containing
isoDGR could be exploited as ligands for targeted delivery of
drugs, imaging agents, or other compounds to tumor
vasculature. [Cancer Res 2008;68(17):7073–82]

Introduction
It is well-known that tumors cannot grow beyond 2 to 3 mm
without an adequate vascular supply. For this reason, tumors tend
to recruit new blood vessels from the preexisting vasculature by
neoangiogenesis (1, 2). This concept provides the rationale for
developing new strategies for cancer therapy based on administration of drugs that inhibit the formation of new blood vessels
(antiangiogenic drugs) or drugs that destroy or alter existing tumor
blood vessels (vascular-targeting agents; ref. 3). In the last decade,
many investigators have made efforts to identify molecules capable
of interacting with receptors expressed in angiogenic vessels, in the

attempt to generate new antiangiogenic drugs or to obtain ligands
for targeted delivery of other drugs to tumors.
Panning of peptide-phage libraries in tumor-bearing mice
has proven useful for selecting peptides able to interact with proteins expressed within tumor-associated vessels and, therefore, to
home to neoplastic tissues (4). Among the various ligands identified
thus far, peptides containing the asparagine-glycine-arginine (NGR)
motif have been exploited for ligand-directed targeted delivery of
various drugs and compounds to angiogenic vessels. For instance,
we have shown that the therapeutic index of certain cytokines
capable of affecting tumor blood vessels, such as tumor necrosis
factor a (TNF) and IFNg, can be improved by fusing their NH2 or
COOH termini to peptides containing the NGR motif (5–7). In
particular, the CNGRC-TNF fusion protein (called NGR-TNF) has
improved vasculature-damaging properties and improved antitumor activity, compared with TNF (5, 8). We have also shown that
administration of ultralow doses (picograms) of NGR-TNF, but not
of TNF, exert synergistic antitumor effects with various chemotherapeutic drugs, such as doxorubicin, melphalan, cisplatin, paclitaxel,
and gemcitabine, by altering drug-penetration barriers (7–11).
NGR-TNF, alone and in combination with chemotherapy, is currently
tested in phase II clinical trial.
We have recently shown that the NGR motif, which recognizes a
CD13 isoform expressed in angiogenic vessels (12–15), can rapidly
convert to isoDGR, by asparagine deamidation, and that this motif
can interact with avh3, an integrin critically involved in
angiogenesis (16–18). The transition of NGR to isoDGR can occur
also in fibronectin, an extracellular matrix protein that contains
four NGR sites, generating new avh3 integrin binding sites (16).
Considering that avh3 integrin is a good marker of angiogenic
vessels, natural or synthetic polypeptides containing isoDGR may
be exploited, in principle, as ligands for targeted delivery of cytotoxic drugs or nanoparticles to angiogenic vessels in tumors.
To address this hypothesis, we have investigated the tumor
vasculature homing properties of a CisoDGRC peptide coupled
to fluorescent nanoparticles (quantum dots) or fused to TNF
(isoDGR-TNF). We show that indeed CisoDGRC can recognize
tumor vessels and that it can be exploited for targeted delivery of
TNF to tumors, improving its therapeutic index.

of TNF fused with the COOH terminus of CDGRCG) were prepared by
recombinant DNA technology as described (5, 16).
Preparation and characterization of synthetic peptides. The NH2terminal acetylated peptides prepared were as follows: CisoDGRCGVRSSSRTPSDKY, CRGDCGVRSSSRTPSDKY, CNGRCGVRSSSRTPSDKY,
and CARACGVRSSSRTPSDKY (called Ciso DGRC-hTNF 1-11, CRGDChTNF1-11, CNGRC-hTNF1-11, and CARAC-hTNF1-11, respectively). These
peptides consist of CisoDGRCG, CRGDCG, CNGRCG, or CARACG fused to
the NH2-terminal sequence of human TNF (underlined , hTNF1-11) followed
by a Tyr, to enable detection. These peptides contain only one amino group
to enable conjugation to nanoparticles. Each peptide was synthesized and
purified as described (20). All peptides were dissolved in sterile. The
molecular mass of each peptide was checked by MALDI-TOF analysis.
Preparation of isoDGR-Qdot. Amine-modified Qdot nanoparticles
[Qdot605 ITK Amino (PEG) Quantum Dots; Invitrogen] were activated
with bis[sulfosuccinimidyl] suberate (BS3; Pierce), a homobifunctional
crosslinker, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The N-hydroxysuccinimide-nanoparticles were purified from unreacted crosslinker by gelfiltration chromatography on NAP-5 column (GE Healthcare). Colored
fractions were pooled (600 AL) and divided into two separate tubes.
CisoDGRC-hTNF1-11 (160 Ag in 32 AL of water) was then added to one tube,
whereas the other tube was mixed with 32 AL of water alone. Both tubes
were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The conjugates (called
isoDGR-Qdot and Qdot) were then separated from free peptide by
ultrafiltration (Ultra-4 Ultracel-100K; AMICON, Millipore), resuspended in
100 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and stored at 4jC.
Binding assay of isoDGR-Qdot to avh3 integrin. Human avh3
integrin solution, 0.5 Ag/mL in PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+ (DPBS; Cambrex),
was added to 96-wells black ELISA plate (NUNC; Maxisorb; 100 AL/well) and
left to incubate overnight at 4jC. All subsequent steps were carried out
at room temperature. The plates were washed with DPBS and further
incubated with DPBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA;
200 AL per well; 1 h). The plates were washed with 25 mmol/L Tris-HCl,
150 mmol/L sodium chloride, 1 mmol/L magnesium chloride, 1 mmol/L
manganese chloride (pH 7.4; washing solution), and filled with serial
dilution of isoDGR-Qdot or Qdot solution (100 AL per well in washing
solution containing 1% BSA). After incubation for 2 h, the plates were
washed again as described above. The bound fluorescence was determined
using a Victor Wallac3 instrument (excitation filter, F355 nm; emission filter,
595/60 nm).
Binding assay of isoDGR-Qdot to cells. Binding of isoDGR-Qdot or
Qdot to human EA.hy926 cells and to murine WEHI-164 or RMA cells was
carried out as follows: adherent cells were detached with 138 mmol/L
sodium chloride, 2.7 mmol/L potassium chloride, 10 mmol/L sodium
phosphate (pH 7.3; PBS), containing 5 mmol/L EDTA. After washing with
PBS, the cells were resuspended in 25 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L
sodium chloride, 1 mmol/L magnesium chloride, 1 mmol/L manganese
chloride, 1% BSA, 0.02% sodium-azide containing serial dilution of isoDGRQdot or Qdot solution (5  105 cell/200 AL tube) and left to incubate 2 h at
37jC, 5% CO2. After washing, cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde in PBS
and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).
Binding assay of isoDGR-Qdot to tumor sections. Surgical specimens
of human renal cell carcinoma were obtained from the Department of
Histopathology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute. The tumor tissues were
embedded in ornithine carbamyl transferase medium (Bio-Optica) cryosectioned at 20jC into slice of 6-Am thickness, and adsorbed on polylysinecoated slides. Tumor sections were incubated in 25 mmol/L HEPES
(pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L sodium chloride, 1 mmol/L magnesium chloride,
1 mmol/L manganese chloride, and 3% BSA (binding buffer) for 1 h at room
temperature. The solution was then removed and replaced with binding
buffer containing isoDGR-Qdot or Qdot (1:2,500). After 2 h of incubation at
room temperature, tissue sections were rinsed for 10 min with binding
buffer and further incubated for 5 min with PBS containing 0.1 Ag/mL 4¶,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma). The slides were rinsed again and
incubated for 10 min at room temperature with PBS containing 2%
paraformaldehyde and 3% sucrose. After extensive washing with PBS, slides
were examined under the microscope (Carl Zeiss, Axioscop 40FL; excitation

filter, BP 560/40 nm; beam splitter filter, FT 585 nm; emission filter,
630/75 nm). Costaining experiments were performed as follows: tissue
sections were incubated with isoDGR-Qdot or Qdot solution containing the
mAb anti-CD31, or anti-avh3, or anti-a5h1, respectively (4 Ag/mL), for 1 h at
room temperature. The solution was then removed and replaced with
isoDGR-Qdot or Qdot solution containing goat anti-mouse IgG antibody
FITC-conjugated FITC (1:100). The slides were incubated for 1 h at room
temperature, rinsed again, and processed as described above.
Purification and characterization of isoDGR-TNF by high performance liquid chromatography analysis. IsoDGR-TNF was isolated from
NGR-TNF by reverse-phase (RP)–high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) using a C-3 column (Zorbax 300SB-C3, 5-Am, 300Å, 2509.4 mm;
Agilent), connected in line with 2-Am column prefilter (Supelco), as follows:
mobile phase A, 5 mmol/L sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), containing
5% acetonitrile in water; mobile phase B, 5 mmol/L sodium phosphate
buffer (pH 6.8), containing 70% acetonitrile in water; 0% B for 10 min, 30% B
for 5 min, linear gradient 30% to 65% B in 35 min, 100% B for 10 min, 0% B
for 10 min, and flow rate of 4 mL/min. HPLC fractions were partially dried
using a Savant Speed-Vac System, to eliminate the organic phase, and stored
at 80jC until further analysis. Protein purity and identity were checked by
SDS-PAGE and electrospray mass spectrometry. The in vitro cytolytic
activity of each HPLC fraction was measured by cytolytic assay with L-M
mouse fibroblasts (21) using murine TNF as reference standard (National
Institute for Biological Standards and Control).
Protein digestion with trypsin. NGR-TNF (20 Ag), diluted in 100 AL
of 50 mmol/L phosphate buffer and 150 mmol/L sodium chloride (pH 7.4),
was incubated for 24 h at 37jC or at 20jC. Thirty microliters of trypsinagarose (1:1 suspension; Sigma) were added to each sample. Protein
digestion was carried out at room temperature under gentle agitation. After
3 h of digestion, the sample was centrifuged through a Spin-x filter (Corning
Incorporated), to remove trypsin-agarose, and stored at 20jC until
analysis.
In vivo studies. Studies on animal models were approved by the Ethical
Committee of the San Raffaele Scientific Institute, and performed according
to the prescribed guidelines. BALB/c (Harlan) or C57BL/6N mice (Charles
River Laboratories), weighing 16 to 18 g, were challenged with s.c. injection
in the left flank of 106 WEHI-164 or 7  104 RMA living cells; 5 to 10 d later,
mice were treated i.p. with protein solution (100 AL). All proteins were
diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride containing 100 Ag/mL endotoxin-free
human serum albumin (Farma-Biagini SpA). Tumor growth was monitored
daily by measuring tumor volumes with calipers, as previously described
(22). Animals were sacrificed before tumors reached 1.0 to 1.5 cm in
diameter. Tumor sizes are shown as mean F SE (5 to 12 animals per group).

Results
IsoDGR-Qdot binds endothelial cells in culture and in tumor
vessels. To investigate the tumor vasculature binding properties
of CisoDGRC, we have coupled CisoDGRCGVRSSSRTPSDKY,
a peptide consisting of CisoDGRC fused to the NH2-terminal
sequence of human TNF (CisoDGRC-hTNF1-11), to amine-modified
quantum dots. Given that hTNF1-11 residues do not interfere in the
binding of CisoDGRC to integrins (16), this sequence was exploited
as a spacer. This peptide-Qdot conjugate was called isoDGR-Qdot.
In parallel, we prepared similar conjugates with the ARA sequence
in place of isoDGR (ARA-Qdot) and quantum dots without peptide
(Qdot), to be used as negative controls. To verify that CisoDGRC
was functional after conjugation, we analyzed the binding of these
conjugates to purified avh3 integrin absorbed onto microtiterplates. As expected, isoDGR-Qdot, but not of Qdot, could bind to
avh3 integrin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Furthermore,
no binding of ARA-Qdot was observed, suggesting that the isoDGR
sequence was critical for binding. This also confirms that the
binding was entirely dependent on the CisoDGRC domain and not
the hTNF1-11 sequence added as a spacer.

Tumor Targeting with isoDGR Peptides

To assess whether isoDGR-Qdot could also bind membraneassociated integrins, we tested the binding of isoDGR-Qdot to
EA.hy926 cells, an endothelial cell line known to express isoDGR
receptors (16). Fluorescence microscopy experiments showed
binding of isoDGR-Qdot, but not of Qdot, to adherent EA.hy926
cells (Fig. 1B). FACS analysis of EA.hy926 cells after incubation with
these conjugates confirmed that isoDGR-Qdot, but not Qdot, could
bind these cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C, top). The
binding was efficiently inhibited by free CisoDGRC-hTNF1-11
peptide, whereas no inhibition was observed with CARAChTNF1-11 (Fig. 1C, bottom). This suggests that the binding was
mediated by the isoDGR sequence. Of note, the binding of isoDGRQdot was also inhibited by CRGDC-hTNF1-11, although less efficiently. This is in line with the hypothesis that integrin receptors

were recognized by isoDGR-Qdot. To assess the role of CD13, the
ligand of NGR, we also evaluated the binding of isoDGR-Qdot in
the absence and in the presence of mAb WM15 (10 Ag/mL), an
anti-CD13 mAb able to inhibit the binding of NGR-peptides to
CD13 (23). No inhibition of binding was observed (data not shown),
suggesting that the interaction with EA.hy926 cells was primarily
mediated by integrins.
Interestingly, little or no binding of isoDGR-Qdot was observed
to RMA lymphoma cells (Fig. 1D), a cell line that do not express av
subunits (24), and to WEHI-164 fibrosarcoma cells (not shown),
suggesting that these cells do not express isoDGR receptors.
Next, we studied the binding of isoDGR-Qdot to tumor vessels
using human renal cell carcinoma sections. Fluorescence microscopy analysis of tissue sections with isoDGR-Qdot (red) and with

an anti-CD31 antibody (green), a well-known endothelial marker,
showed a good colocalization of red and green fluorescence (Fig. 2).
In contrast, no binding to vessels was observed with Qdots (Fig. 2).
The binding of isoDGR-Qdot to tumor vessels was efficiently
inhibited by CisoDGRC-hTNF1-11 peptide, whereas no inhibition
was observed with CARAC-hTNF1-11 (data not shown). These
results suggest that CisoDGRC is a good ligand of tumor vessels.
Interestingly, colocalization was observed also with isoDGR-Qdot
and anti-avh3 or anti-a5h1 antibodies (Fig. 2). IsoDGR-Qdot could
also bind vessels in murine RMA lymphoma tissue sections but not
normal vessels in muscle tissue sections (data not shown). These
data, together, suggest that the CisoDGRC peptide can bind specific
receptors, likely integrins, within tumor vessels.
RP-HPLC of deamidated NGR-TNF separates different
fractions (P2 and P3) that contain isoDGR-TNF and NGRTNF. To assess whether the CisoDGRC motif can be exploited for
targeted delivery of drugs to tumors, we prepared CisoDGRC-TNF
fusion protein. Because this product cannot be produced by

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (17). September 1, 2008

standard DNA technology, we tried to prepare it by deamidation of
NGR-TNF and reverse-phase chromatography. RP-HPLC analysis of
NGR-TNF revealed two minor peaks, called P1 and P2, and a major
peak, called P3 (Fig. 3A, top). Rechromatography of these peaks, by
RP-HPLC, showed single peaks and no change in their retention
time (Fig. 3A, bottom), indicating that the corresponding products
were stable after separation. The molecular mass of P1, P2, and
P3, as measured by electrospray mass spectrometry analysis,
were 17,944.8 F 1.19 Da, (n = 2), 17,844.7 F 0.75 Da, (n = 5), and
17,843.7 F 0.62 Da, (n = 4), respectively. Because the expected
molecular weight of NGR-TNF is 17,844.2, these results suggest that
P3 corresponds to NGR-TNF, whereas P1 and P2 correspond to
modified products. Sequence analysis of P1 by Edman degradation
showed that the NH2 terminus was modified, as no reaction with
phenylisothiocynate could occur. P1, therefore, was discarded. The
molecular mass of P2, which is only 1 Da greater than that of P3,
suggests that this product corresponds to isoDGR-TNF and/or
DGR-TNF, as Asn/isoAsp and Asn/Asp transitions are accompanied

Tumor Targeting with isoDGR Peptides

by an increase of 1 Da. To verify that indeed P2 and P3 correspond
to isoDGR-TNF/DGR-TNF and NGR-TNF, respectively, we performed additional experiments.
First, incubation of NGR-TNF in conditions that favor Asn
deamidation [i.e., at 37jC, for 4 hours (pH 8.5)] caused a rapid
decrease of P3 and an increase of P2 (Fig. 3A, top). TNF, under the
same conditions, was homogeneous and stable (data not shown),
suggesting that the different chromatographic behavior of P2 and
P3 was indeed related to the NGR domain.
Second, limited trypsin digestion of NGR-TNF, before and
after heat treatment for 24 hours, produced two different peptides with monoisototopic masses (MH+) of 894.5 Da and 895.5
Da, respectively, corresponding to disulfide-linked CNGRfCGLR
and CDGRfCGLR/CisoDGRfCGLR peptides, cleaved at the RC
bond (expected, 894.40 and 895.40 Da, respectively; Fig. 3B).

Third, NH2-terminal sequences of P2 and P3, as measured by the
Edman degradation method, were XDGRXG and XNGRXG,
respectively, where X is likely Cys, which cannot be determined
by Edman degradation.
Fourth, P2 and P3 contained 0.70 F 0.14 and <0.05 pmol isoAsp/
pmol of protein, respectively, as measured by IsoQuant Isoaspartate
Detection kit (Promega).
These results strongly suggest that P2 corresponds to a mixture
of DGR-TNF and isoDGR-TNF, whereas P3 corresponds to NGRTNF. Based on these findings, P2 was produced in larger amounts
by incubating NGR-TNF for 4 hours, in 0.1 mol/L ammonium
bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5), at 37jC, followed by RP-HPLC. P3 was
directly purified from untreated NGR-TNF by RP-HPLC.
Both P2 and P3 are trimeric proteins biologically active in
cytolytic assays. Bioactive TNF is a homotrimeric molecule (25).

Figure 4. Effect of P2, P3, TNF, and DGR-TNF on tumor
growth in the WEHI-164 model. Mice bearing WEHI tumors
(6 or 12 per group) were treated 5 d after tumor
implantation with various doses of P2 (A), P3 (B), TNF, and
DGR-TNF (C ; i.p.). Tumor volumes after treatment are
shown; points, mean; bars, SE.

To assess whether P2 and P3 could form bioactive trimers, both
products were further characterized by biochemical and biological
assays.
Nonreducing SDS-PAGE of both products showed bands
corresponding to 17 to 18 kDa subunits (Supplementary
Fig. S1A), whereas analytic gel-filtration chromatography showed
peaks corresponding to proteins of 45 to 50 kDa, as expected for
homotrimeric molecules (Supplementary Fig. S1B). To assess
whether the TNF domain was properly folded and functional, we
measured the cytolytic activity of P2 and P3 against L-M cell.
The specific activities obtained were 6.4 F 1.98  108 U/mg and
2.03 F 0.18  108 U/mg, respectively. Because the specific activity
of unmodified TNF is 2  108 U/mg, these results suggest that both
products were biologically active.
We have previously shown that peptides containing CisoDGRC
can bind avh3 integrin and promote endothelial EAhy.926 cell

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (17). September 1, 2008

adhesion, whereas little or no binding occurs with peptides
containing CDGRC or CNGRC (16). To assess whether the
CisoDGRC domain of P2 was functional, we analyzed, therefore,
its capability to bind avh3 and to promote cell adhesion in vitro.
The results showed that P2, but not P3, could bind avh3 integrin
(Fig. 3C) and could induce endothelial cell adhesion (Fig. 3D), as
expected. In contrast, DGR-TNF, prepared by recombinant DNA
technology, and TNF could neither bind avh3 nor promote cell
adhesion (data not shown).
These results suggest that both targeting and effector domains of
the isoDGR-TNF component of P2 are properly folded and
functional.

were sufficient to induce significant antitumor effects (Fig. 4A
and B). Administration of higher doses (30–100 ng) or lower dose
(0.2 pg) induced lower antitumor responses (data not shown),
suggesting that dose-response curves were bell-shaped in both
cases, with maximal activity in the 1 to 10 pg range. Remarkably, no
significant effects were obtained with 1 pg of recombinant DGRTNF or TNF (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that P2 and P3 can
induce antitumor effects with similar potency, and that the effect
observed with P2 was mainly due to the isoDGR-TNF component.
These results also rule out the possibility that the activity of P2
was due to the presence of NGR-TNF contaminants (<1% by
RP-HPLC).
No loss of body weight was caused by any tested dose of P2 or
P3, suggesting that the antitumor effects described above were
induced without causing major toxicity. Furthermore, no loss
of body weight was observed when mice were treated with
100 Ag/mouse/day of CisoDGRCGVRY peptide for 7 days, suggesting that the isoDGR peptide does not cause major toxicity either
when used alone or coupled to TNF (data not shown).
Antitumor activity of P2 and P3 in combination with
melphalan in the RMA lymphoma model. In previous work,
we showed that administration of picogram doses of NGR-TNF
(e.g., 0.1 ng) to RMA tumor–bearing mice increases the penetration
of chemotherapeutic drugs in tumors, whereas similar doses of
TNF were inactive (7). The antitumor activity of P2 and P3 in

combination with melphalan was therefore tested in the RMA
lymphoma model. A single administration of melphalan (90 Ag)
induced little or no effects (Fig. 5A and B, left). When melphalan
was administered to mice in combination with various doses of P2
(5–100 pg), we observed a synergistic effect, as expected (Fig. 5A,
left). Similar effects were also observed when animals were treated
with melphalan in combination with various doses of P3 (4–100 pg;
Fig. 5B, left). No increase of melphalan-dependent toxicity (body
weight loss) was induced by P2 or P3 (Fig. 5A and B, right),
suggesting that both products could increase the antitumor activity
of melphalan without increasing its toxicity. Synergy was observed
also when melphalan (50 Ag) was administered 30 min after P2
(not shown).
Also in this model, no antitumor effects were observed with
DGR-TNF/melphalan (20 and 80 pg; Fig. 5C), confirming the
hypothesis that the active component of P2 is isoDGR-TNF.
Considering that also TNF is inactive in this model when
administered at comparable doses (5), these results, together,
suggest that fusion of TNF to CisoDGRC improved its antitumor
activity, alone and in combination with chemotherapy.
Mechanism of action of P2. To assess whether the antitumor
activity of P2 depends on targeted delivery of TNF to isoDGR
receptors in tumors, we coadministered P2 (1 pg) with a molar
excess of CisoDGRCGVRY (isoDGR-2C) peptide (100 Ag) to WEHI164 tumor–bearing mice. IsoDGR-2C inhibited most of the

antitumor effects induced by P2 (Fig. 6A, left). Similarly, isoDGR-2C
could inhibit the activity of isoDGR-TNF in combination with
melphalan in the RMA model (Fig. 6B), supporting the hypothesis
that the improved activity of P2 was related to an isoDGRdependent targeting mechanism. Remarkably, the same treatment
did not affect the antitumor activity of P3 (Fig. 6A, right). These
results are in line with the hypothesis that the receptors of isoDGR
and NGR are different, i.e., integrins and CD13, respectively.

Discussion
We have recently shown that fibronectin fragments containing
the isoDGR motif (called isonectins) can bind integrins typically
expressed by angiogenic vasculature, such as avh3 and a5h1 (16).
This notion led us to hypothesize that peptides containing isoDGR
could be exploited as ligands for targeted delivery of drugs and
nanoparticles to angiogenic vessels.
The results of the current study suggest that isoDGR can indeed
be exploited for this purpose. In particular, the results of binding
studies obtained with a peptide containing the cyclic CisoDGRC
sequence coupled with fluorescent Qdot nanoparticles (isoDGRQdot) show that this motif can bind not only purified avh3 integrin
adsorbed on microtiter plates, as previously shown with isonectins,
but also tumor vessels. The good colocalization of isoDGR-Qdot
with anti-CD31, anti-avh3, and anti-a5h1 antibodies in tumor
tissue sections suggests that activated endothelial cells of angiogenic vessels, known to express these markers, are important
targets of isoDGR. Accordingly, isoDGR-Qdot could also bind
EA.hy926 cells in vitro, an immortalized endothelial cell line that

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (17). September 1, 2008

express avh3. The binding could be competed by peptides
containing CisoDGRC as well as by peptides containing CRGDC,
a well-known integrin binding motif (26). This suggests that
isoDGR can bind the RGD binding site of integrins on the
endothelial cell surface.
The concept that cyclic peptides containing isoDGR can be
exploited as ligands for drug delivery to tumors is supported by the
results of pharmacologic studies carried out in murine lymphoma
and fibrosarcoma models, showing that the antitumor activity of a
CisoDGRC-TNF fusion protein (isoDGR-TNF) is greater than that of
TNF and of CDGRC-TNF (DGR-TNF), a similar fusion protein
unable to interact with avh3. Of note, although DGR-TNF and TNF
were produced by expression in Escherichia coli cells, isoDGR-TNF
could not be prepared by standard recombinant DNA technology,
as no codon/anticodon pairs exist in these cells for isoaspartate.
Thus, we have developed a method for preparing isoDGR-TNF
based on incubation of recombinant NGR-TNF at pH 8.5 for
4 hours (37jC), i.e., in conditions that are known to favor NGR
deamidation and consequent formation of isoDGR and DGR in 3:1
ratio (16). Two main components, called P2 and P3, were separated
from the product by RP-HPLC. The results of sequence analysis and
biochemical characterization studies show that P2 corresponded
to a mixture of isoDGR-TNF and DGR-TNF, i.e., the products of
NGR deamidation, whereas P3 corresponded to NGR-TNF. P2 and
P3 formed bioactive homotrimers, as indicated by the results of
SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry, gel-filtration chromatography, and
cytolytic assays. Furthermore, P2, but not P3 (NGR-TNF) and DGRTNF, could bind to avh3 and promote endothelial cell adhesion
in vitro. These findings suggest that both targeting and effector

Tumor Targeting with isoDGR Peptides

domains of isoDGR-TNF (i.e., isoDGR and TNF) present in P2 were
properly folded and functional. Moreover, the finding that ultralow
doses of P2 (1–10 pg), but not of DGR-TNF, could induce antitumor
effects in mice, implies that isoDGR-TNF was indeed the biologically active component of P2. The hypothesis that the improved
activity of P2 was related to isoDGR-directed delivery of TNF to
tumors is also supported by the observation that coadministration
of P2 with an excess of an isoDGR-containing peptide inhibited its
antitumor activity.
Interestingly, although the activity of purified isoDGR-TNF (P2)
was inhibited by coadministration with an excess of a peptide
containing CisoDGRC, the activity of purified NGR-TNF (P3) was
not inhibited. This finding supports the hypothesis that isoDGRTNF and NGR-TNF work via different receptors, likely integrins and
CD13 (12, 16). These results, together, suggest that isoDGR is a
novel tumor vasculature-targeting motif.
The results of the present work could also have important
pharmacologic implications for NGR-drug conjugates previously
developed. Various compounds and particles have been coupled to
NGR peptides in an attempt to increase their neovasculaturehoming attributes, including cytotoxic drugs, cytokines, antiangiogenic compounds, viral particles, fluorescent compounds, contrast
agents, DNA complexes, and other biological response modifiers
(4–6, 8, 14, 27–39). In principle, isoDGR formation may occur in all
these conjugates during preparation and storage, depending on pH
and buffer composition. Furthermore, considering that the kinetics
of isoDGR formation in cyclic NGR peptides is very fast (half-life, 3–
4 hours in DMEM at 37jC; ref. 16), it is possible that transition of
isoDGR to NGR occurs also in vivo, after conjugate administration.
Although the amount of isoDGR formed in vivo could be low for
conjugates with short plasma half-life, such as in the case of NGRTNF, this reaction could be relevant for drugs with long half-life,

such as liposomes (28), or for conjugates that persist in tissues for
several hours, such as fluorophore-tagged CNGRC (14). Noteworthy,
various conjugates have been prepared using linear and cyclic
peptides with different NGR flanking residues (23, 35, 40).
Finally, given that the NGR motif is also present in fibronectin
and that generation of isoDGR in this protein may represent a
mechanism for regulating its function (16), the finding that
peptides containing isoDGR can bind tumor vessels may suggest
that also deamidated fibronectin or fibronectin fragments could
bind endothelial cells in tumor vessels, with potentially important
physiologic and pathologic implications. Of note, damaged vessels
can release protein-L-isoAsp-O-methyltransferase, an enzyme that
can convert isoaspartate to aspartate (16, 41), pointing to a
potential mechanism for regulating its function.
In conclusion, the results obtained with isoDGR-Qdots and
isoDGR-TNF suggest that natural or synthetic polypeptides containing the isoDGR motif may be exploited as ligands for targeted
delivery of drugs, nanoparticles, imaging compounds, or genes to
angiogenic vasculature in tumors or in other angiogenesis-related
diseases.
