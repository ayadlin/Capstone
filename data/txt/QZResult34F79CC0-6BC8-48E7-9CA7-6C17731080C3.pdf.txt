Abstract
Melanoma differentiation associated gene-7(mda-7) encodes IL-24, a cytokine that can selectively trigger
apoptosis in transformed cells. Recombinant mda-7 adenovirus (Ad.mda-7) effectively kills glioma cells, offering a novel gene therapy strategy to address deadly brain tumors. In this study, we defined the proximal mechanisms by which Ad-mda-7 kills glioma cells. Key factors implicated included activation of the endoplasmic
reticulum stress kinase protein kinase R–like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), Ca++ elevation, ceramide
generation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. PERK inhibition blocked ceramide or dihydroceramide generation, which were critical for Ca++ induction and subsequent ROS formation. Activation of autophagy and cell death relied upon ROS formation, the inhibition of which ablated Ad.mda-7–killing activity. In
contrast, inhibiting TRX induced by Ad.MDA-7 enhanced tumor cytotoxicity and improved animal survival in
an orthotopic tumor model. Our findings indicate that mda-7/IL-24 induces an endoplasmic reticulum stress
response that triggers production of ceramide, Ca2+, and ROS, which in turn promote glioma cell autophagy
and cell death. Cancer Res; 70(3); 1120–9. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
In the United States, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is diagnosed in ∼20,000 patients per annum. High-grade tumors
such as anaplastic astrocytoma and GBM account for the
majority of tumors (1). Even when all of the tumor can be
surgically removed and patients are maximally treated with
radiation and chemotherapy, the mean survival is only extended from ∼3 to ∼12 months (1).
The melanoma differentiation–associated gene-7/ interleukin 24 (mda-7/IL-24) gene was isolated from human melanoma cells induced to undergo terminal differentiation by IFN
and mezerein treatment (2). MDA-7/IL-24 protein expression
is decreased in advanced melanomas, with undetectable levels
in metastatic disease (2–4). This cytokine is a member of the
interleukin-10 (IL-10) family (5–12). Enforced expression of
MDA-7/IL-24 by a recombinant adenovirus Ad.mda-7 inhibits

growth and kills a broad spectrum of cancer cells without exerting deleterious effects in normal human epithelial or fibroblast cells (9–14). Considering its potent cancer-specific
apoptosis-inducing ability and tumor growth–suppressing
properties in xenograft models, mda-7/IL-24 was evaluated
in a phase I trial (10, 11, 15, 16). This study indicated that
Ad.mda-7 injected intratumorally was safe, and with repeated
injection, significant clinical activity was evident.
The apoptotic pathways by which Ad.mda-7 causes cell
death are not fully understood; however, current evidence
suggests an inherent complexity and an involvement of
proteins important for the onset of growth inhibition and apoptosis, including BCL-XL, BCL-2, and BAX (9–14). In melanoma cell lines, but not in normal melanocytes, Ad.mda-7
infection induces a decrease in BCL-2 and BCL-XL levels,
with a modest upregulation of BAX and BAK expression
(17). The ability of Ad.mda-7 to induce apoptosis in DU-145
prostate cancer cells, which do not produce BAX, indicates
that MDA-7/IL-24 could also mediate apoptosis by a BAX-independent pathway (9–12). Overexpression of BCL-2 or BCLXL protects cells from Ad.mda-7–induced toxicity in a cell
type–dependent fashion (18). In one ovarian cancer line,
MDA-7/IL24 was reported to kill via the extrinsic apoptosis
pathway (19). Thus, MDA-7/IL-24 lethality seems to occur by
multiple distinct pathways in different cell types, but in all of
these studies, killing is reflected in a profound induction of
mitochondrial dysfunction (20).
The ability of MDA-7/IL-24 to modulate cell signaling
processes in transformed cells has been investigated by
several groups (13–32). Our laboratories have shown that
Ad.mda-7 kills melanoma cells, in part, by promoting p38

mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)–dependent activation of the growth arrest and DNA damage–inducible genes,
including GADD153 and GADD34 (27). In primary GBM cells,
however, we noted p38 MAPK signaling as a protective signal
(25). Other groups have argued that inhibition of phosphoinositide-3-kinase signaling, but not ERK1/2 signaling, modestly promotes Ad.mda-7 lethality in breast and lung cancer
cells (28–30).
MDA-7/IL-24 toxicity has been linked to alterations in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signaling (21). In addition to
virus-administered mda-7/IL-24, delivery of this cytokine as a
bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase fusion protein, GST-MDA-7, retains cancer-specific killing, selective
ER localization, and induces similar signal transduction
changes in cancer cells. We have noted that high concentrations of GST-MDA-7/IL-24 or infection with Ad.mda-7 kills
human glioma cells in an ER stress–dependent fashion that
is contingent on mitochondrial dysfunction (22–25). The
present studies have elucidated in detail the proximal
mechanisms downstream of Ad.mda-7–induced ER stress
that mediate MDA-7/IL-24 toxicity.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies and Santa Cruz Biotechnology. N-acetyl cysteine was
supplied by Calbiochem. Media and penicillin-streptomycin
were purchased from Life Technologies. Dr. David Guis
(Radiation Oncology Branch National Cancer Institute
Bethesda, MD) supplied the TR/TRX plasmids. The plasmids
to express BiP/GRP78 and calbindin D28 were provided by
Dr. A. Lee (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Keck School of Medicine, USC/Norris Comprehensive
Cancer Center, Los Angeles, CA), and Dr. Y.J. Oh (Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea), respectively.
Methods
Generation of Ad.mda-7. Recombinant serotype 5 adenoviruses to express MDA-7 (Ad.mda-7) and control (Ad.cmv
vector) were generated using recombination in HEK293
cells (14).
Cell culture and in vitro infection of cells with Ad.mda7. All lines were cultured at 37°C (5% v/v CO2) in vitro using
RPMI supplemented with 5% (v/v) FCS. Primary human glioma cells were subcultured in 2% (v/v) FCS for 1 wk prior to
in vitro analyses, after which cells were cultured in 5% serum.
For short-term cell-killing assays and immunoblotting, cells
were plated at a density of 3 × 103 per cm2 and 24 h after
plating were infected [Ad.cmv; Ad.mda-7 (GBM6 and
GBM14 at 10 multiplicity of infection; GBM12 at 25 multiplicity of infection)] and the expression of the recombinant viral
transgene allowed to occur for 24 h prior to any additional
procedure, including irradiation (4 Gy). In vitro inhibitor
treatments were from a 100 mmol/L stock solution of each
drug and the maximal concentration of vehicle (DMSO) in
medium was 0.02% (v/v).

Cell treatments, SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis.
For SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, cells were lysed in either a nondenaturing lysis buffer, and prepared for immunoprecipitation as described (33), or in whole-cell lysis buffer
[0.5 mol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1% βmercaptoethanol, and 0.02% bromophenol blue], and the
samples were boiled for 30 min. The boiled samples were
loaded onto 10% to 14% SDS-PAGE and electrophoresis
was run overnight. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto 0.22 μm nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with
the indicated primary antibodies against different proteins.
Recombinant adenoviral vectors; infection in vitro. We
generated and purchased adenoviruses to express constitutively active MEK1 EE, constitutively active AKT, dominant
negative MEK1, dominant negative caspase 9, CRM A, and
BCL-XL (Vector Biolabs). Cells were infected with these
adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 50. Cells were
further incubated for 24 h prior to ensure adequate expression of transduced gene products (23–25).
Detection of cell death by trypan blue, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling,
and flow cytometric assays. Trypan blue, Annexin V/propidium iodide, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling assays were carried out in
triplicate to determine cell viability (24–26).
Plasmid transfection. Plasmid DNA was transfected using
LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the
instructions of the manufacturer.
Microscopy for LC3-GFP expression. Twelve hours after
transfection, LC3-green flourescence protein (GFP)–transfected
cells were infected (where indicated) with either Ad.cmv or
Ad.mda-7, and then cultured for 24 h. LC3-GFP–transfected
cells were visualized at the indicated time points on the Zeiss
Axiovert 200 microscope using the FITC filter.
Generation of Rho zero GBM6 cells. GBM6 cells were
cultured in 50 μmol/L of uridine, 1 mmol/L of sodium pyruvate, and the growth medium supplemented with 10 μg/dm3
of ethidium bromide. Cells were cultured in this medium for
3 wk before any further experimentation.
Assessment of reactive oxygen species generation. GBM
cells were plated in 96-well plates using phenol red–free medium. Cells were preincubated with the peroxide-sensitive fluorescent dye 2′,7′-dichloro-dihydrofluorescein diacetate, or the
superoxide-sensitive dye dihydroethidium (5 μmol/L for 30
min; both from Molecular Probes). Intracellular fluorescence
measurements for reactive oxygen species (ROS) determination
were obtained 0 to 24 h after virus infection with a Vector 3 plate
reader. Data are presented corrected for basal fluorescence of
vehicle-treated empty well dye blank at each time point (32).
Assessment of cytosolic Ca2+ levels. A high-speed wavelength switching fluorescence image analysis system (a Vector 3 plate reader) was used to determine [Ca2+] i in the
carcinoma cells, seeded in 96-well plates (20,000 cells per
well), with fura-2 acetoxy-methylester (fura-2) as an indicator. The ratio of fura-2 emissions, when excited at the 340
and 380 nm wavelengths, was recorded and analysis software
provided with the Vector 3 plate reader were used to process
and statistically analyze data (33).

Mass spectrometric determination of ceramide/dihydroceramide levels. GBM cells were infected/transfected with
plasmids and were scraped into PBS 12 h after infection.
Lipids were isolated from the cells and ceramide isoforms
analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (34, 35).
Data analysis. Comparison of the in vitro effects of
various treatments was performed using one-way ANOVA
and a two-tailed Student's t test. Differences at P < 0.05 were
considered statistically significant. Experiments shown
are the means of multiple individual points from multiple
experiments (±SEM).

Results
Expression of MDA-7/IL-24 increased thioredoxin (TRX)
and manganese superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) protein levels, but not of SOD1 (Supplementary Fig. S1). Expression

as judged using 2′,7′-dichloro-dihydrofluorescein diacetate
that was suppressed by the overexpression of TRX or
SOD2, and was enhanced by the expression of mutant inactive TRX or by knockdown of SOD2 levels (Fig. 1A and B; Supplementary Fig. S2). Similar data were obtained examining
ROS (superoxide) as judged using dihydroethidium (data
not shown). MDA-7/IL-24–induced ROS levels peaked 12
hours after infection, slightly delayed by several hours from
the earliest detectable induction of MDA-7/IL-24 protein
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
Inhibition of mitochondrial function using small molecule
inhibitors or using mitochondria-deficient Rho zero cells, reduced MDA-7/IL-24–induced levels of ROS, whereas small
molecule–mediated inhibition of cytosolic NADPH oxidases
had little effect on ROS (Fig. 1C). In agreement with the
concept that increased ROS levels are toxic, expression of
TRX or SOD2 suppressed Ad.mda-7–induced killing and expression of mutant TRX or knockdown of SOD2 enhanced

Ad.mda-7–induced lethality (Fig. 1D). In colony formation
expression of thioredoxin reductase or TRX enhanced
survival against Ad.mda-7, whereas expression of mutant
TRX reduced colony formation (Supplementary Fig. S3).
We examined the effect of manipulating ROS levels on
Ad.mda-7–induced ER stress, autophagy, and signal transduction. TRX suppressed Ad.mda-7–induced Beclin1 and LC3-II
expression, the activation of protein kinase R–like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), eIF2α and JNK1-3, and ERK1/
2 and AKT inactivation (Fig. 2A). Expression of mutant
TRX enhanced MDA-7/IL-24–induced Beclin1, ATG5, and
LC3-II expression; enhanced PERK, eIF2α, p38 MAPK, and
JNK1-3 phosphorylation, and abolished ERK1/2 and AKT
phosphorylation. TRX binds to the MAP3K upstream of

JNK1-3, apoptosis signaling kinase 1, and ROS-induced inactivation of TRX promotes apoptosis signaling kinase 1 activation
(32).Expression of dominant negative apoptosis signaling kinase 1 blocked MDA-7/IL-24–induced activation of JNK1-3
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Twelve hours after infection of
Ad.mda-7 in control cells, ROS levels were increased; however,
we did not observe increased LC3-GFP vesicularization at
this time, indicative of autophagy (Fig. 2B). Ad.mda-7 infection
produced measurable increases in autophagy 24 to 48 hours
after infection. Expression of TRX suppressed MDA-7/IL-24–
induced LC3-GFP vesicularization, whereas expression of mutant TRX increased vesicularization. Knockdown of Beclin1 or
ATG5 expression blocked autophagy and nearly abolished Ad.

We determined the roles of altered kinase activities in the

Activation of MEK1 or combined activation of MEK1 and AKT

cells lysed and lipids extracted prior to analyses by tandem mass spectrometry (n = 4; three experiments ± SEM). *, P < 0.05 greater than Ad.cmv control.

We determined whether MDA-7/IL-24 caused any changes
in the cytosolic levels of Ca2+. Ad.mda-7 infection increased
cytosolic Ca2+ levels within 12 hours (Fig. 3A). The increase in
Ca2+ was blocked by dominant negative PERK or calbindin
D28 expression, but was not altered by TRX toxicity expression. Calbindin D28 expression blocked Ad.mda-7–induced
ROS and blunted the ability of mutant TRX to further increase
ROS levels (Fig. 3B). Infection of GBM cells with Ad.mda-7 promoted eEF2 phosphorylation that was blocked by expression
of calbindin (Supplementary Fig. S6; ref. 36).
Prior studies examining the effects of MDA-7/IL-24 in carcinoma cells has shown that ceramide generation plays a key
role in cytokine lethality (32, 35). Inhibition of the de novo
ceramide synthesis pathway, and to a lesser extent, the acidic

sphingomyelinase (ASMase) pathway, significantly reduced
Ad.mda-7–induced ROS levels (Fig. 3C). Similar data were
obtained when ceramide synthase 6 (LASS6) expression
was knocked down (data not shown). Inhibition of the
de novo ceramide synthesis pathway using myriocin or
knockdown of LASS6 blocked Ad.mda-7–induced changes
in cytosolic Ca2+, whereas ASMase inhibition only partially
blunted Ca2+ (Fig. 3D).
The mechanism by which Ad.mda-7 increased dihydroceramide levels was explored using a vector to express a FLAGtagged LASS6. Infection of FLAG-LASS6–transfected cells
with Ad.cmv did not alter FLAG-LASS6 levels compared with
uninfected cells (Supplementary Fig. S7). More noticeably,
infection of cells with Ad.mda-7 caused a large increase in

FLAG-LASS6 protein levels. As FLAG-LASS6 was being expressed from a plasmid using a constitutively active cytomegalovirus promoter, our data suggest that expression of
MDA-7/IL-24 stabilized LASS6 mRNA/protein levels. Expression of dominant negative PERK reduced Ad.mda-7–induced
LASS6 levels by 63 ± 3% (P < 0.05).
Expression of dominant negative PERK or knockout of
PERK abolished Ad.mda-7–induced ROS levels, and knockout
of PERK blocked Ad.mda-7–induced cytosolic Ca2+ changes
(Fig. 4A and B). Inhibition of de novo ceramide synthesis;
inhibition of changes in cytosolic Ca2+; or expression of
dominant negative PERK suppressed Ad.mda-7 lethality
(Fig. 4C). Expression of MDA-7/IL-24 rapidly increased
ceramide and dihydroceramide levels within 12 hours, which
was suppressed by >80% by dominant negative PERK
or by knockdown of LASS6 (Fig. 4D; Supplementary Fig.
S8; data not shown). Calbindin D28 expression blocked
MDA-7/IL-24–induced ceramide but did not alter MDA-7/
IL-24–induced dihydroceramide levels.
Radiotherapy is a primary modality in GBM treatment.
Ad.mda-7 enhanced the toxicity of ionizing radiation in a
dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 5A). Radiation enhanced the
vesicularization of LC3-GFP and combined with Ad.mda-7
infection caused an at least additive increase in LC3-GFP vesicle numbers (Fig. 5B). The ability of radiation to increase
vesicle formation was blocked by the expression of calbindin
D28, TRX, or dominant negative PERK; or by knockdown of
LASS6 (data not shown). Knockdown of ATG5 or Beclin1
suppressed autophagy and reduced, although it did not abolish, the toxic interaction between MDA-7/IL-24 and radiation
(Fig. 5C). In colony assays, knockdown of ATG5 or Beclin1
almost abolished the toxicity of either Ad.mda-7 or radiation;
however, combined MDA-7/IL-24 and radiation exposure,
even in the absence of autophagy, was still capable of causing
a significant survival reduction (Fig. 5D). Knockdown of Beclin1 suppressed MDA-7/IL-24–induced cytosol release of cytochrome c, and partially suppressed the release caused by
MDA-7/IL-24 + radiation exposure (Supplementary Fig. S9).
Inhibition of TRX has been postulated to improve the
therapeutic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs, and TRX inhibitors are undergoing phase I evaluation (37). Infection of
GBM6 cells with Ad.mda-7 suppressed tumor formation, as
did transfection with mutant TRX (Supplementary Fig. S10).
GBM cells expressing both MDA-7/IL-24 and mutant TRX
did not form progressive tumors for up to 28 days postimplantation. Animals infected with Ad.cmv + vector had
a mean survival of 38 ± 7 days; animals infected with
Ad.cmv + mTRX had a mean survival of 47 ± 4 days; animals infected with Ad.mda-7 + vector had a mean survival
of 79 ± 9 days; animals infected with Ad.mda-7 + mTRX
were all viable 110 days postimplantation (P < 0.05 different
from Ad.mda-7 + vector).

Discussion
Previous studies have noted that MDA-7/IL-24 reduces proliferation and causes tumor cell–specific killing and radiosensitization (20). Although PERK-dependent autophagy and

JNK-signaling plays a key role in killing by mda-7/IL-24 of
GBM cells, the precise pathways proximally downstream
of PERK activation provoked by Ad.mda-7 and causally related
to its cancer-specific cell killing effects require further
clarification. The studies in this article were designed to define
precisely how GBM cells respond to MDA-7/IL-24.
Infection of GBM cells with Ad.mda-7 that caused ∼30%
apoptosis in 72 hours correlated with the induction of
ceramide, dihydroceramide, cytosolic Ca2+, and ROS 12 hours
after infection. The increased levels of ceramide, dihydroceramide, cytosolic Ca2+, and ROS were blocked by the expression
of dominant negative PERK. Inhibition of ceramide genera‐
tion blocked increased cytosolic Ca2+ and ROS levels and
quenching of cytosolic Ca2+ blocked the induction of ROS.
Quenching of Ca 2+ also inhibited MDA-7/IL-24–induced
ceramide production. Quenching of Ca 2+ did not block
MDA-7/IL-24–induced dihydroceramide levels and MDA-7/
IL-24 increased the expression of ceramide synthase 6. Inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory function blocked increased
ROS, and quenching of ROS blocked MDA-7/IL-24–induced
autophagy. Genetic suppression of autophagy blocked
Ad.mda-7 toxicity. Our data favors a model for MDA-7/IL-24
actions in GBM cells in which MDA-7/IL-24, by disrupting
the interaction between PERK and its chaperone BiP/GRP78,
causes PERK to become activated which promotes dihydroceramide generation followed by a codependent induction
of Ca2+ and ceramide, leading to greater levels of cytosolic
Ca2+ that affects mitochondria to generate ROS; elevated
ROS levels stimulate toxic autophagy leading to tumor cell
death (Supplementary Fig. S11).
PERK signaling could promote tumor cell death or survival
based on the stimulus (e.g., refs. 24, 25, 38, 39). There are
three primary unfolded protein response sensors: PERK, activating transcription factor 6, and inositol-requiring enzyme 1.
As unfolded proteins accumulate, BiP/GRP78, the HSP70
ER-resident chaperone, dissociates from PERK, activating
transcription factor 6, or IRE1. BiP/GRP78 dissociation
from PERK allows this protein to dimerize, autophosphorylate, and then phosphorylate eIF2α, the protein required
for bringing the initiator methionyl-tRNA to the 40S ribosome (25). Phosphorylated eIF2α leads to the repression
of global translation, helping cells to recover from the accumulation of unfolded proteins. Reduced translation can also
lower the expression of short-lived prosurvival proteins
such as MCL-1. MDA-7/IL-24 binds to BiP/GRP78, and in
GBM cells, we hypothesized that this binding would play a
central role in regulating PERK activity and regulating
MDA-7/IL24–induced killing (21, 25, 32). A constitutively active
form of MEK1 maintained ERK1/2 phosphorylation in cells expressing MDA-7/IL-24, increased BiP/GRP78 expression,
blocked PERK activation, and reduced MDA-7/IL-24 lethality.
Overexpression of BiP/GRP78 blocked MDA-7/IL-24–induced
PERK activation and tumor cell death. Expression of dominant negative PERK blocked MDA-7/IL-24–induced activation of eIF2α and JNK1-3 as well as reduced expression of
MCL-1. Thus, in GBM cells MDA-7/IL-24, by binding to BiP/
GRP78, results in the disruption of the BiP/GRP78-PERK chaperone interaction resulting in enhanced PERK signaling into

MDA-7 and ROS

autophagy. A, GBM6 cells infected with Ad.cmv or with Ad.mda-7 and 12 h later irradiated (0–6 Gy). Cells were isolated 48 h after infection and viability
determined (±SEM, n = 3). *, P < 0.05 greater differential between Ad.cmv and Ad.mda-7 values in unirradiated cells. B, GBM6 cells transfected with plasmids:
to express LC3-GFP and to express nothing, TRX, calbindin D28, or dominant negative PERK. Twelve hours later, cells were infected with Ad.cmv or
Ad.mda-7. Twenty-four hours after infection, slides were examined for punctate GFP vesicles (±SEM, n = 3). #, P < 0.05 less than corresponding value in

the eIF2α and JNK pathways that act to promote mitochondrial dysfunction.
The production of ROS was also essential in the regulation
of ERK1/2, AKT, JNK1-3, and p38 MAPK by MDA-7/IL-24,
with overexpression of TRX blocking inhibition of ERK1/2
and AKT, and blunting the activation of JNK1/2 and p38
MAPK, and conversely, the expression of mutant TRX facilitating the inactivation of ERK1/2 and AKT and greater activation of JNK1-3 and p38 MAPK. Multiple studies using a
variety of cytokine and toxic stimuli document that prolonged JNK1-3 and/or p38 MAPK activation in a wide variety
of cell types could trigger apoptosis (40). TRX can reduce

many oxidized proteins and it supports a large system of redox detoxification reactions. Sequential univalent transfer
occurs with many redox proteins that generate superoxide
species so that hydrogen peroxide is a common product of
these reactions. Dismutation of the superoxide anion to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen occurs at a rapid rate and the
reaction of radicals with radical scavengers such as TRX results in a highly efficient conversion of radicals to nonradical
oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide (41).
In addition to modulating the activities of signal transduction pathways, inhibiting ROS detoxification in vitro enhanced
MDA-7/IL-24–induced ROS levels that promoted greater

autophagy levels. The mechanisms by which elevated ROS levels regulate autophagy are not fully understood. There are
multiple possibilities for radical species to alter ER stress levels. Reactive nitrogen species could inhibit protein disulfide
isomerase activity, leading to increased protein unfolding
in the ER and activation of PERK and JNK1/2 with resultant
cell killing (42). The PI3P lipid phosphatase “Jumpy” negatively regulates autophagy and it is known that lipid and tyrosine phosphatase activities are inactivated by elevated ROS
levels (43, 44).
MDA-7/IL-24 and ionizing radiation interact in a greater
than additive fashion to kill GBM cells in vitro and in vivo.
As has been noted by others, we found that exposure of primary human GBM cells to radiation increased LC3-GFP vesicle levels within 24 hours (45). Some studies have argued
that radiation-induced autophagy is a protective effect following exposure, whereas others have argued that autophagy
plays a role in radiosensitization (46, 47). Our data argued
that ATG5 or Beclin1 knockdown suppressed radiation toxicity in GBM cells. Radiation and MDA-7/IL-24 interacted to
cause a greater than additive induction of autophagic vesicles in GBM cells and suppression of ceramide, Ca 2+, or
ROS signaling abolished the MDA-7/IL-24 + radiationinduced increase in autophagy. However, whereas inhibition
of autophagy suppressed the toxic effects of MDA-7/IL-24 or
radiation in colony formation assays to a level approaching
those observed in control-treated cells, the combination of
MDA-7/IL-24 + radiation still exhibited a significant, albeit
reduced, amount of killing. Prior analyses have shown that
MDA-7/IL-24 + radiation toxicity is completely blocked by
pan-caspase inhibitors and inhibitors of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Measurable radiation-induced increases in ROS
levels in tumor cells are known to be dependent on functional mitochondria acting as amplifiers of ROS that act to
promote MDA-7/IL-24–induced activation of JNK1-3, and
subsequently, BAX and BAK (24, 25). Our findings argue that
radiation enhances MDA-7/IL-24 toxicity via promoting in-

creased autophagy, and in a direct manner, via elevated
JNK signaling with increased cytochrome c release from the
mitochondrion.
Expression of dominant negative PERK suppressed ceramide generation in GBM cells, which implies either that PERK
directly or indirectly through its kinase phosphorylates ASMase and/or ceramide synthase 6 to regulate their activity
or that activation of PERK via eIF2α modulates the expression
of proteins which result in elevated ER-localized ceramide activity. In this regard, both acid and neutral ceramidase enzymes are known to be regulated by transcription and have
∼6 hours half-life (48). However, preliminary assays noted that
acid ceramidase levels did not decrease in response to MDA-7/
IL-24 expression. In contrast, we found that MDA-7/IL-24 expression increased the protein levels of FLAG-tagged LASS6.
As FLAG-LASS6 is expressed using a constitutively active promoter, these findings argue that MDA-7/IL-24 promotes the
stabilization of LASS6 mRNA and/or protein. The precise ER
and mitochondrial targets of MDA-7/IL-24–induced ceramide
generation in GBM cells will need to be examined in detail in
future studies.
