ABSTRACT
Members of the bromodomain and extra-C terminal (BET) domain protein
family and the histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzyme family regulate the expression
of important oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Here we show that the BET
inhibitor JQ1 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of both triple negative and
estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells. Consistent with the critical role of
histone acetylation in the regulation of gene expression, treatment with JQ1 or the
HDAC inhibitor mocetinostat was associated with global changes in gene expression
resulting in suppression of genes involved in cell-cycle regulation. Combining JQ1
with mocetinostat, further decreased cell viability. This synergistic effect was
associated with increased suppression of genes essential for cell-cycle progression.
Furthermore, we detected dramatic increase in the expression of several members
of the ubiquitin–specific protease 17 (USP17) family of deubiquitinating enzymes
in response to the combination treatment. Increased expression of USP17 enzymes
were able to attenuate the Ras/MAPK pathway causing decrease in cell viability,
while, siRNA mediated depletion of USP17 significantly decreased cytotoxicity after
the combination treatment. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that co-treatment
with BET inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors reduces breast cancer cell viability through
induction of USP17.

INTRODUCTION

as target-specific drugs are not available [2]. Thus the use
of novel molecularly targeted approaches to treat breast
cancer is of great interest.
Next to the accumulation of genetic mutations,
there is growing evidence that reversible modifications
of histone proteins and DNA are crucial to the onset and
progression of breast cancer. These, so called epigenetic
modifications, play major roles in the regulation and
modulation of gene expression, representing an attractive
mechanism that can be exploited in breast cancer therapy
[3].
Acetylation and deacetylation are among the
most abundant histone post-translational modifications
and are regulated by two families of enzymes: histone

Breast cancer has the highest incidence and
mortality (13%) among all cancer types diagnosed in
women worldwide with nearly 1,5 million new cases per
year [1]. Histology and biomarkers are tools to subgroup
breast cancer and also determine treatment regimen.
Estrogen receptor alpha (ER)-expressing breast tumors are
classically treated with anti-estrogens. However, some of
these tumors present as endocrine resistant at diagnosis or
develop resistance during treatment. Treatment of triplenegative breast cancer (TNBC), a tumor type defined by
lack of expression of ER, progesterone receptor (PR) and
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), is a challenge

acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases
(HDACs). HATs facilitate the transfer of acetyl groups to
the ε-amino group on lysine residues of histone proteins.
HDACs oppose the action of HATs and remove the acetyl
group from lysine residues. Acetylation has the effect of
neutralizing the overall negative charge of the histone
tail. This results in a relaxed structure of the chromatin,
permissive to the recruitment of the transcriptional
machinery. Significant correlations have been reported
between histone modification status, tumor biomarker
phenotype, and clinical outcome, where high relative
levels of global histone acetylation were associated with
a favorable prognosis [4]. HDAC inhibitors (HDACis)
are currently considered as candidate new drugs in breast
cancer therapy. A number of early phase clinical trials
have been completed or are ongoing [3, 5], but the initial
optimism has not been completely translated to clinical
success. As single agents, HDACis have proven less
successful for the treatment of breast cancer therefore,
much effort is invested in evaluating rational combinations
[3].
Histone acetylation also directly promotes
transcription by providing binding sites for BET
proteins that recognize or “read” histone modifications
and assemble a complex of co-regulatory proteins such
as positive transcription elongation factor b complex
(P-TEFb) to facilitate gene transcription [6, 7]. The
BET family consists of four members in humans, the
bromodomain-containing proteins (BRD), BRD2,
BRD3 and BRD4 and the bromodomain testis-specific
protein (BRDT). Through the initiation of transcription
elongation, BRD4 has been shown to increase the
transcription of various genes such as MYC, cyclin A,
cyclin D1 and BCL2, all involved in initiation and growth
of tumors [8, 9, 10].
Several selective, small-molecule BET protein
inhibitors have recently been developed. Among these,
JQ1 is in preclinical development for cancer treatment as
several studies demonstrated its anti-tumorigenic activities
in preclinical models of hematological malignancies
and neuroblastoma [9, 10, 11]. JQ1 binds competitively
to bromodomains to displace BET proteins along
with associated transcription factors, from chromatin.
Inhibition of BRD4-promoter interactions has been shown
to suppress the expression of important cell growth and
survival genes, resulting in cell cycle arrest and extensive
apoptosis in ER+ breast cancer [12, 13], leukemia [9]
and lymphoma [14] cells. However, the utility of BET
inhibitors in TNBC has not been investigated.
In this study we show that the small-molecule
BET inhibitor JQ1 exerts growth inhibitory effects on
a representative panel of TNBC and ER+ breast cancer
cell lines and that this is associated with global changes
in gene expression. Consistent with a synergistic effect of
diverse levels of epigenetic regulation on gene expression,
we report synergistic effects of JQ1 and the HDACi

mocetinostat on regulation of gene expression. These
effects coincided with a significant suppression of several
cell-cycle related genes, up-regulation of members of the
USP17 family of deubiquitinating enzymes and downregulation of the Ras/MAP kinase signaling pathway
which is commonly dysregulated in TNBC [15].

RESULTS
JQ1 exerts pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative
effects in TNBC and ER+ breast cancer cell lines.
To test the effect of JQ1 on breast cancer cells,
two TNBC (MDA-MB-231 and BT549) and two ER+
(MCF7 and T47D) breast cancer cell lines were treated
with increasing concentrations of JQ1 for 48 hours.
Cell viability was determined by the WST-1 assay. We
observed that JQ1 significantly decreased cell viability
in a dose-dependent manner in all four tested cell lines
(Fig. 1A). This result was further confirmed by the trypan
blue exclusion assay (Fig. S1), which serves as an index
of cell viability. Visual inspection of cells following JQ1
treatment showed that in addition to a decrease in cell
number, cells also changed morphology. These changes
were most marked in the BT549 and T47D cell lines
which showed various extents of cell shrinkage and
cell membrane blebbing consistent with apoptosis (Fig.
1B). These observations suggested that JQ1 may induce
apoptosis. This was measured by an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and flow cytometry. As
shown in Fig. 1C, JQ1 treatment induced apoptosis in
BT549, MCF7 and T47D cells but not in MDA-MB-231
cells. Furthermore, there is an induction of necrosis in
the BT549 and MCF7 cells (Fig. 1D). Next we used flow
cytometry subsequent to staining with propidium iodide
(PI) to assess cell cycle progression after 48 hours of
JQ1 treatment. The cell cycle analysis revealed that JQ1
treatment induced significant G0/G1 phase and G2/M
phase cell cycle arrest in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells
respectively (Fig. 1E). We did not observe significant
changes in the G0/G1 and G2/M transitions in the BT549
and T47D cell lines but JQ1 significantly decreased the
S-phase population in all cell lines except MCF7 cells.
Together these findings demonstrate that JQ1 exerted
significant growth inhibitory effects in the investigated
breast cancer cell lines as a result of prolonged duration
of the cell cycle and/or increased cell death. JQ1 seems
to display cell line selectivity as it does not exert a strong
pro-apoptotic activity in MDA-MB-231 cells but exerts
anti-proliferative effects at different phases of the cell
cycle progression in all cell lines. Finally, JQ1 exerts both
pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effect in the MCF7
cell line.

viability, the four breast cancer cell lines were treated
with increasing concentrations of mocetinostat or VPA for
two days. As shown in Fig. 3B, mocetinostat induced a
significant and dose-dependent decrease in cell viability.
Based on the IC50 values shown in Fig. 3C, ER+ cells
were more sensitive to mocetinostat treatment with IC50
values of 1.17 µM and 0.67 µM for MCF7 and T47D cells,
respectively, compared to IC50 values of 4.38 µM and 3.04
µM determined for the TNBC cell lines BT549 and MDAMB-231, respectively. VPA also decreased cell viability at
higher millimolar concentrations (Fig. S2A and B).
Since both BET and HDAC inhibitors are known
to alter gene expression and both groups of inhibitors
attenuated cell viability in our experiments (Fig. 1A, 3B
and S2A), we next asked if co-treatment with JQ1 and
HDACi would further decrease cell viability. All four
breast cancer cell lines were treated for two days with a
combination of JQ1 (1 µM) and mocetinostat (cell line
dependent IC50 value) (Fig. 3D) or a combination of JQ1 (1
µM) and VPA (cell line dependent IC50 value) (Fig. S2C).
We observed that the combination treatments significantly
decreased cell viability compared to treatment with JQ1,
mocetinostat or VPA alone in MDA-MB-231, BT549
and MCF7 cell lines but not in the T47D cell line. The
results also showed that TNBC cells were more sensitive
to both mocetinostat-JQ1 and VPA-JQ1 combinations, as
compared to the ER+ cells.

It has previously been shown that BRD4 plays an
important role in the regulation of cell cycle progression
and cell viability. Furthermore, of the BET proteins,
BRD4 is the most sensitive to JQ1 treatment [16]. We
therefore assessed BRD4 expression in the investigated
breast cancer cell lines. BRD4 was found to be expressed
in all four cell lines (Fig. 2A). BRD4 is known to
positively regulate the transcription of c-Myc through the
recruitment of P-TEFb, which activates RNA POLII [9].
Consistent with this, JQ1 treatment suppressed c-Myc
mRNA expression (Fig. 2B). However, the time course
was different for the different cell lines. In the MDAMB-231 cell line we observed a transient down-regulation
at the earliest investigated time point (4 hours) after JQ1
treatment. In the BT549 and T47D cell lines, we observed
a time dependent decrease in c-Myc mRNA expression,
however of different magnitudes. Finally, in the MCF7
cell line, we observed increased c-Myc mRNA expression
at an early time point (4 hours) which was followed by a
decrease at later time points (8 and 16 hours). Importantly,
JQ1 decreased the levels of the c-Myc protein for all
cell lines (Fig. 2C). c-Myc promotes either cell cycle
progression or apoptosis through inhibiting expression
of target genes such as CDKN1A, known to inhibit
proliferation and inducing expression of pro-apoptotic
genes such as BAX [17]. In concert with the attenuation
of c-Myc expression, JQ1 treatment up-regulated the
mRNA expression of CDKN1A and down-regulated the
mRNA expression of BAX (Fig. 2B). Similar results were
observed at the level of protein expression. JQ1 treatment
decreased BAX protein levels and increased CDKN1A
protein levels in all four cell lines (Fig. 2C).

JQ1 and mocetinostat down-regulate similar
cellular pathways
To further characterize the cellular effects of JQ1
and HDACis, alone or in combination, we performed a
comparative global gene expression analysis for MDAMB-231 cells treated with JQ1 or mocetinostat alone or in
combination. Transcripts deregulated ≥ 2 fold (P < 0.001)
were derived from three independent experiments. The top
1000 up- and down-regulated genes are depicted in the
heatmap (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, a total of 361 and
743 genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively, by
JQ1 treatment. The mocetinostat treatment resulted in the
up-regulation of 1171 and down-regulation of 1002 genes.
The combination treatment up-regulated 1187 genes while
the expression of 1443 genes was suppressed.
Global gene expression profiles were further
analyzed to reveal possible molecular mechanisms and
signaling pathways involved in the response of MDAMB-231 cells to JQ1, mocetinostat and the combination
of these. Fig. 4C shows the top five pathways up- and
down-regulated by JQ1, mocetinostat or the combination
treatment, respectively (Table S3 shows the full list of
biological process categories significantly altered by the
treatments in MDA-MB-231 cells). The results show that
genes down-regulated by the single treatment with JQ1 or
mocetinostat or the combination treatment are overlapping

Combination treatment with HDAC inhibitors
and JQ1 has synergistic effects in breast cancer
cell lines
To test the efficacy of HDACis on HDAC
expression and histone acetylation, the breast cancer
cell lines were treated with increasing concentrations of
the HDACis, VPA and mocetinostat, independently, for
two days. De-acetylation of histone H3 was efficiently
inhibited by both mocetinostat and VPA in all four cell
lines (Fig. 3A). With regard to histone H4, mocetinostat
clearly induced hyper-acetylation in all cell lines except
BT549. On the contrary, VPA only clearly induced hyperacetylation in the MDA-MB-231 cell line. None of the
HDACis significantly changed the expression of HDAC1,
HDAC2 and HDAC3 proteins in MDA-MB-231, BT549
or MCF7 cells but both inhibitors reduced the expression
levels of HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC3 in T47D cells
(Fig. 3A). To determine the effect of HDACis on cell

promoting genes, e.g. CDK1 (-33-fold), CDCA8 (-32fold), CCNA2 (-29-fold) were significantly reduced. This
result is consistent with our observation of decreased cell

six up-regulated and top six down-regulated genes are
listed in Fig. 5A. Among the top up-regulated genes, we
found several members of the USP17 deubiquitinating
family that were up-regulated by the single compound
treatments and further increased by the combination
treatment. Furthermore, cell cycle related genes were
down-regulated by the single compound treatment and
then further down-regulated by the combination treatment.
We examined USP17 and USP17L5 expression
by QPCR in all four breast cancer cell lines after drug
exposure. Increased USP17 and USP17L5 expression was
found in both ER+ and TNBC cell lines after combination
treatment (Fig. S3). We further examined dose-responsive
changes of USP17 and USP17L5 expression in MDAMB-231 cells. A dose dependent increase in USP17 and
USP17L5 mRNA levels was observed (Fig. 5B). Similar
results were observed with combination treatments where
we applied increasing concentrations of one inhibitor with

mocetinostat or with their combination for two days and
examined the protein expression level of one member of
the USP17 family (USP17L5) and also the activity of the
Ras/MAPK signaling pathway. Fig. 6A shows a significant
increase of the USP17L5 protein level in MDA-MB-231
cells after treatment with JQ1 or mocetinostat. The
USP17L5 protein expression was further increased by the
combination treatment. We found the levels of activated
Ras were markedly reduced in samples treated with the
combination of JQ1 and mocetinostat. Consistent with
the lower level of activated Ras, levels of phosphorylated

USP17L5 mRNA expression was time dependent with
a dramatic increase between the 24 and 48 hours time
points (Fig. 5C). It is well established that USP enzymes
regulate cell growth and survival [18]. Furthermore,
USP17 inhibits cell proliferation [19] partly through the
regulation of the activity of the Ras converting enzyme
1 (RCE1) resulting in a decrease in activity of the Ras/
MAPK signaling pathway [20], which could also explain
our results shown in Fig. 1E. To confirm if the dramatic
increase in USP17 mRNA expression was associated with
a corresponding decrease in the activity of Ras signaling,

is involved in the synergistic effect of the combination
treatment, we used selumetinib to specifically block the
MEK protein. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with
JQ1, mocetinostat or selumetinib alone or with their
combinations. Selumetinib treatment led to a significant
decrease in cell viability in all combinations compared
to single agent treatment (Fig. 6B). We next determined
whether siRNA-mediated USP17 depletion would affect
the cytotoxicity following drug treatment. We observed
that knockdown of USP17 significantly increased the
cell viability after 48 hours treatment with JQ1 (1 µM) or

and BT549 cell lines, purely anti-proliferative effects in
the MDA-MB-231 cell line and both pro-apoptotic and
anti-proliferative effects in the MCF7 cell line (Fig. 1B1E). Similarly, effects of JQ1 with regard to progression
through the cell cycle, also displayed cell line selectivity.
JQ1 efficiently attenuated both c-Myc mRNA and protein
expression in all four breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 2B,
2C). Knowing the central role of c-Myc in proliferation
and malignant transformation of human and animal cells
[22] and the growth inhibitory effect of JQ1, it is tempting
to conclude that targeting the BET-family of proteins
represents an exciting novel approach to treat breast
cancer. However, the complexity of c-Myc regulation
and the differences in cellular response to JQ1 treatment
also underline the importance of further characterizing the
effects of JQ1 treatment on c-Myc signaling in different in
vitro and in vivo models of breast cancer.
Several reports demonstrate a critical role of
HDACs in epigenetic regulation of gene expression in
breast cancer [23]. Besides romidepsin and vorinostat,
which have been approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell
lymphoma, an increasing number of HDACis have been
developed and recently advanced to clinical trials [24].
Many HDACis have demonstrated preclinical efficacy as
monotherapy for hematological malignancies however,
as single agents they have proven less successful for the
treatment of solid tumor malignancies [3]. Therefore,
much effort has been invested in evaluating rational
combinations of HDACis and interest in HDACis in
combination therapy is growing.
Selective targeting of epigenetic readers as a
potential therapeutic strategy became available recently

DISCUSSION
It has previously been demonstrated that BET
inhibitor treatment leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
in different cancer forms such as acute myelogenous
leukemia, medulloblastoma and Burkitt`s lymphoma
[9, 10, 16, 21]. The BET inhibitor JQ1 increased the
percentage of cells in the G1-phase and reduced the
percentage of cells in the S-phase in leukemia cells [9].
In this study we demonstrated that JQ1 can influence
proliferation and apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines
representative of two different types of breast cancer. We
utilized MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cell lines as models
of TNBC and MCF7 and T47D cell lines as models of
ER+ breast cancer. We further provided evidence that JQ1,
dose-dependently decreased cell viability in all four breast
cancer cell lines (Fig. 1A). We also demonstrated that JQ1
displays diverse cell line dependent growth inhibitory
actions showing mainly pro-apoptotic effects in T47D

with the recent discovery of BET bromodomain inhibitors
such as JQ1 [25], I-BET151 [26], I-BET726 [27]. Previous
studies in hematological malignancies have suggested
that co-treatment with BET and HDAC inhibitors is
more effective than each agent alone [9]. We tested two
HDACis different in their structural characteristics,
selectivity, efficacy and clinical developmental phase.
VPA is a broad-spectrum HDACi with relatively
weak (millimolar) inhibition on HDACs [28] with a
clear advantage that it has been on the market for nononcological uses for decades. Mocetinostat is a benzamide
HDACi, selective of HDAC1, 2 and 3 enzymes [29]. In
accordance with previous reports, we found that both
HDACis induce hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4
and decrease cell viability in all four tested cell lines (Fig.
3A-C, S2A, B). We tested both VPA and mocetinostat in
combination with JQ1 and both combinations decreased
cell viability synergistically in the MDA-MB-231, BT549
and MCF7 cell lines but not in the T47D cell line (Fig.
3D, S2C). Since single agent treatment with JQ1, VPA or
mocetinostat was comparable and equally efficient in all
four cell lines, the lack of significant synergistic effects in
the T47D cell line requires further investigation.
TNBC, lacking ER, PR and HER2 is considered
to constitute the most drug-resistant and difficult-to-treat
subtypes of breast cancers [2, 15]. The MDA-MB-231
cell line is representing the mesenchymal-like (ML),
claudin-low subtype of TNBC which lacks luminal
differentiation markers, but shows high enrichment of
genes involved in cell motility, epithelial to mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and growth factor signalling pathways
among others [30]. Overall, patients with claudin-low
tumors have an increased likelihood of distant recurrence
and death partly due to the highly invasive nature of the
disease [18, 31]. We chose the MD-MB-231 cell line for a
more extensive molecular characterization as it displayed
extensive decrease in cell viability after the combination
treatment and we prioritized to further examine this highly
aggressive and treatment resistant subtype of breast
cancer. Since mocetinostat is active at low micromolar
concentrations (Fig. 3C) and induced a higher level of
histone acetylation especially on histone H4 (Fig. 3A),
we chose the mocetinostat-JQ1 combination treatment
to investigate global gene expression changes in MDAMB-231 cells upon treatment. Gene expression profiling
revealed that both JQ1 and mocetinostat had extensive
and similar effects on the transcriptome (Fig. 4A, 4B).
Furthermore, gene ontology analysis showed that both
monotherapy and combination treatment affected genes
involved in cell cycle progression and proliferation (Fig.
4C and S3). We also observed significant time- and
dose-dependent increases in the expression of several
members of the USP17 subfamily of cytokine-inducible
deubiquitinating enzymes (Fig. 5A-5C).
DUB enzymes constitute a large family of proteases,
essential in the renewal of the polyubiquitin chains for use
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

during ubiquitination. USP is one of the five sub-families
of DUB enzymes. Several lines of evidence suggest that
the USP17 family regulates cell growth and survival and
that constitutive expression of USP17 can block cell
proliferation [18, 32]. Furthermore, USP17-mediated Lys63-specific deubiquitination of SDS3 (a key component
of the HDAC-dependent Sin3A co-repressor complex)
resulted in decreased activity of HDACs in HeLa cells
[33]. This raises the possibility that a positive feedback
loop may exist between USP17 and HDACs which leads
to a further decrease of HDAC activity following upregulation of USP17.
It has also been reported that USP17 is capable
of regulating Ras/MAPK signaling partly through the
regulation of the RCE1 [18]. Since Ras is a key protooncogene in a number of cancers and the aberrant
regulation of the Ras/MAPK pathway is one of the
most common events in breast cancer progression [15]
we tested the activity of the Ras/MAPK pathway upon
JQ1 and mocetinostat single agent treatments and cotreatment. We observed an increase in USP17L5 protein
expression and a decrease in the activity of Ras (GTPbound Ras) after combination treatment (Fig. 6A). In
accordance with decreased Ras activation, we also found
decreased phosphorylation levels of MEK and ERK1/2
enzymes after combination treatment, meanwhile none
of the tested components of the Ras/MAPK pathway
(including Ras, MEK and ERK1/2) showed altered
protein expression levels in response to the treatments.
Furthermore, substitution for each drug with the selective
MEK1/2 inhibitor, selumetinib resulted in decreased cell
viability (Fig. 6B) while siRNA mediated silencing of
USP17 rescued MDA-MB-231 cells from either JQ1 or
mocetinostat single agent or combination treatments (Fig.
6C), suggesting that the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway
is involved in the synergistic effect of the combination
treatment.
In summary, we have shown that the BET
bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 decreased cell viability in
cultured human breast cancer cells representing both
TNBC and ER+ breast cancers. Our finding also revealed
that JQ1 treatment potentiated the anti-proliferative
and pro-apoptotic effects of the HDACis VPA and
mocetinostat. Gene expression profiling revealed that
both JQ1 and mocetinostat induced similar changes in
the transcriptome of MDA-MB-231 cells which resulted
in down-regulation of cell cycle related genes and upregulation of several members of the USP17 sub-family.
This latter effect could likely be connected to the stronger
anti-proliferative effect of the combination treatment
through the down-regulation of the Ras/MAPK signaling
pathway. Our study demonstrates that co-treatment with
BET inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors reduces breast cancer
cell viability through induction of USP17, suggesting that
such a regimen may be an effective treatment for breast
cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for
detection of cell death

Cell lines and reagents

MCF7, T47D, BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells were
plated in 96-well tissue culture plates at 1 × 104 cells/well
and treated with the indicated concentrations of JQ1 for
48 hours. Apoptosis and necrosis, were determined with
the Cell Death Detection ELISA PLUS Assay kit (Roche)
as previously described [34] in accordance with the
manufacturer`s instructions.

Human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231,
BT549, MCF7 and T47D) were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas,
VA, USA). MCF7 and T47D cell lines are characterized as
representing ER+, luminal A breast cancer and BT549 and
MDA-MB-231 cell lines as triple negative, basal B breast
cancer. MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were routinely
cultured at 37°C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS) (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
T47D and BT549 cells were cultured under the same
conditions but in Roswell Park Memorial Institute
(RPMI) (Invitrogen) medium supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
Valproic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) was
dissolved in sterile water at a stock concentration of 0.4
M. MGCD-0103 (mocetinostat) (SelleckChem, Houston,
TX, USA), (S)-JQ1 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and
AZD6244 (selumetinib) (SelleckChem) were prepared as
1 mM stocks in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide. All stocks were
frozen at -80°C in 20 μl aliquots.

Flow cytometry
For cell-cycle analysis, cells were harvested by
trypsinization, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS, pH 7.4), then fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol and
stored on ice for at least 1 hour. Before analysis, the fixed
cells were incubated with 10 µg/ml propidium iodide
(Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 µg/ml DNase free ribonuclease
A (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min. The cell-cycle phase
distribution was analyzed using FACSCalibur flow
cytometer (BD biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).

Immunoblot analysis
Immunoblotting was performed using standard
protocols using c-MYC, p21, Ac-H3 (Lys9/Lys14), AcH4 (Lys5), p-MEK, MEK, p-ERK1/2, ERK1/2 (Cell
Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), BAX, HDAC1, HDAC2,
HDAC3 (Santa Cruz Inc., Dallas, TX, USA), BRD4
(Bethyl Laboratories Inc., Montgomery, TX, USA),
beta-actin (Sigma-Aldrich), USP17L5 (Abcam) primary
antibodies and horse radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated
anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare,
Piscataway, NJ, USA) secondary antibodies.

WST-1 cell viability assay
Cell viability was assessed using the WST-1
assay (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) following the
manufacturer`s instructions. Cells cultured in 96 well
plates at a concentration of 8 × 103 cells/well and incubated
in the presence of compounds in complete medium for the
indicated times. Three hours after the addition of WST1, absorbance was measured at 440 nm and 650 nm (as
reference wavelength) using a TECAN Infinite® 200 PRO
multimode reader (TECAN, Maennedorf, Switzerland).

RNA isolation and quantitative PCR
Total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy Mini
Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the
manufacturer`s instructions and reverse transcribed
from 1 μg RNA. Quantitative real time PCR (QPCR)
analysis for the expression of c-MYC, CDKN1A
and BAX was carried out with SYBR-Green PCR
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA) in an ABI PRISM 7500 apparatus (Applied
Biosystems) with the following primers: 36B4 forward:
5’-GTGTTCGACAATGGCAGCAT-3’,
reverse:
5’-GACACCCTCCAGGAAGCGA-3;
c-MYC
forward: 5’-GAGCCCCTGGTGCTCCAT-3’, reverse:
5’-TCATCTTCTTGTTCCTCCTCAGAGT-3’; CDKN1A
forward: 5’-AGGTGGACCTGGAGACTCTCAG-3’,
reverse:
5’-TCCTCTTGGAGAAGATCAGCCG-3’;
BAX forward: 5’-CCCGAGAGGTCTTTTTCCGAG-3’,

Trypan blue exclusion assay
Trypan blue solution (0.4%)(Invitrogen), is used as
a cell stain to assess cell viability using the dye exclusion
test. MCF7, T47D, BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells were
seeded at 3x105 cells/well in six-well plates. Following
48 hours treatment with inhibitors or vehicle, cells were
trypsinized and cell suspensions mixed with trypan blue
stain (0.4%) at a one to one ratio. Cells were counted using
Countess Automated Cell Counter (Invitrogen).
