Abstract
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is strongly associated with cancer progression, but its potential
role during premalignant development has not been studied. Here, we show that a 4-week exposure of
immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) to tobacco carcinogens can induce a persistent,
irreversible, and multifaceted dedifferentiation program marked by EMT and the emergence of stem cell–like
properties. EMT induction was epigenetically driven, initially by chromatin remodeling through H3K27me3
enrichment and later by ensuing DNA methylation to sustain silencing of tumor-suppressive microRNAs
(miRNA), miR-200b, miR-200c, and miR-205, which were implicated in the dedifferentiation program in HBECs
and also in primary lung tumors. Carcinogen-treated HBECs acquired stem cell–like features characterized by
their ability to form spheroids with branching tubules and enrichment of the CD44high/CD24low, CD133, and
ALDH1 stem cell–like markers. miRNA overexpression studies indicated that regulation of the EMT, stem-like,
and transformed phenotypes in HBECs were distinct events. Our findings extend present concepts of how EMT
participates in cancer pathophysiology by showing that EMT induction can participate in cancer initiation to
promote the clonal expansion of premalignant lung epithelial cells. Cancer Res; 71(8); 3087–97. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Lung cancer associated with tobacco use may soon become
the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide due to
the advanced stage at detection and the ineffectiveness of
chemotherapy to achieve long-term remission (1). Investigations using malignant tumors and precursor lesions to adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma have provided
insight into some of the genes and pathways that contribute to
malignancy (2, 3). Studies using animal models and human
tumors have established a link between exposure to chemical
carcinogens in tobacco smoke with genomic instability (3),
gene mutation (4), LOH (5), and epigenetic silencing of genes
through DNA methylation of cytosines and histone modifications (2). Moreover, DNA methylation is now recognized as a
causal epigenetic event that occurs during lung cancer progression to affect gene expression (6).

Recently, the activation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) program has been implicated as an important step in the metastasis of lung and other tumors (7). This
process in cancer pathogenesis involves disruption of normal
epithelial integrity, with loss of morphologic features of polarized epithelia, and gain of mesenchymal markers accompanied by the progressive acquisition of a motile and invasive
phenotype (8). EMT is characterized by changes in several
molecular pathways and networks, with the loss of E-cadherin
expression emerging as a critical step driving this developmental program in human cancers, including lung (9–11).
Mechanisms for loss of E-cadherin function include promoter
CpG hypermethylation, histone modifications, and direct inhibition by zinc finger transcriptional repressors ZEB1, ZEB2,
Snail1, and Twist1 (12–17). Recently, specific microRNAs
(miRNA) have been described as crucial regulators of the
EMT process. miRNAs are evolutionary conserved small RNAs
that can modulate gene expression by inhibiting the protein
translation process and/or degrading the respective target
mRNA (18). The miR-200 family and miR-205 are key determinants of the epithelial phenotype by directly targeting ZEB1
and ZEB2, showing that miRNAs can indirectly regulate Ecadherin expression (19, 20). Adding to the complexity of the
EMT regulatory program is the recent discovery of a reciprocal
feedback loop in which transcriptional repressors such as
ZEB1 and ZEB2 bind to E-boxes within the promoter regions
of the miR-200 family to repress their transcription (21, 22).

The morphologic heterogeneity seen in lung tumors suggests that EMT could be an active process driving differentiation and dedifferentiation in early tumor development (23).
The E-cadherin gene is somatically inactivated in many cancers types, such as lobular carcinoma of the breast and diffuse
gastric carcinoma, in which neoplastic cells throughout the
entire tumor mass have lost epithelial characteristics and
display a highly invasive phenotype with features of EMT
(7). Reduced expression of E-cadherin is also seen in solid
cancers at the tumor–stroma boundary where single invading
cells exhibit growth patterns that resemble EMT (7). Local
invasion of carcinoma in situ spreading through the basement
membrane may also involve increased expression of zinc
finger transcriptional repressors, such as ZEB1, which, in turn,
promotes EMT (24). We have developed an in vitro premalignancy lung model that uses human bronchial epithelial cells
(HBEC) to identify genes and pathways critical for neoplastic
transformation associated with exposure to tobacco carcinogens (25). Our initial study showed differences in transformation efficiency associated with DNA repair capacity for
two HBECs after low-dose treatment with the carcinogens
methylnitrosourea (MNU) or benzo(a)pyrene-diolepoxide
(BPDE), or both, for 12 weeks (25). Protein levels of cytosine
DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) increased significantly
during carcinogen exposure and were associated with promoter hypermethylation of 5 to 10 genes in each transformed
cell line (25). The HBECs displayed a change in morphology to
a mesenchymal-like appearance, suggestive of EMT, after
4 weeks of carcinogen treatments that persisted throughout
the remaining treatments and in transformed cells (colonies
recovered from soft agar). The purpose of this study was to
characterize the cellular and molecular changes associated
with morphology and the impact on transformation.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and samples
HBECs (from Drs. Shay and Minna, Southwestern Medical
Center, Dallas, TX) were established from two different people
(HBEC1; smoker without lung cancer; HBEC2; smoker with
cancer; ref. 26). Carcinogen exposures were previously
described (25). Thirteen lung cancer-derived cell lines (Calu6,
Calu3, A549, H358, H522, H23, H1435, H1975, H1993, H2023,
H2085, H2228, and HCC827) were obtained from and authenticated by the American Type Culture Collection. Experiments
were conducted in cell lines passed for a maximum of
6 months postresuscitation.
Twenty-four frozen carcinomas (stage I, TNM staging system) with distant normal lung tissue were obtained from our
New Mexico Lung Cancer Cohort. White bloods cells (WBC)
and normal HBECs from cancer-free smokers were used as
controls. All persons providing tissue specimens signed
informed consent, and the Institutional Review Board of
Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute approved this study.
Soft agar assays
Soft agar assays were conducted as described previously
(27). Cultures were photographed and the colonies with

3088

diameters larger than 100 mm were counted using ImageJ
software (28).
Sphere formation assay
A total of 6  103 cells were plated in 24-well plates and
analyzed in a nonadherent culture conditions, using 10%
Matrigel matrix (BD Biosciences). Plates were inspected for
colony growth and branching morphology on day 10.
FACS analysis
Cells were labeled with antibodies conjugated with fluorescent dyes, anti–CD44-PE (clone G44-26; BD Bioscience),
anti–CD24-FITC (clone ML5; BD Bioscience), and anti–
CD133/2-APC (clone 293C3; Miltenyi Biotec). The antibodies
were diluted in fluorescence-activated cell-sorting (FACS)
buffer (1 PBS, 5% FBS) containing 15% blocking reagent
(Miltenyi Biotec) and sorted with a flow cytometer. The
ALDEFLUOR kit (STEMCELL Technologies Inc.) was used
to isolate a cell population with ALDH1 enzymatic activity
(29).
Gene expression analysis
RNA was isolated with TRI reagent (Sigma) and reverse
transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR) was carried out with the ABI PRISM 7900HT, using
inventoried TaqMan assays (Applied Biosystems). Experiments were normalized to GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase). Data were analyzed with respect to a
calibrator sample using the 2DDCt method (30).
Immunoblot analysis
The anti–E-cadherin, anti-vimentin, anti-ZEB1, anti–
b-actin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used at
1:1,000 dilution.
miRNA expression analysis
Total RNA (1 mg) was reverse transcribed using the miScript
Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen). qRT-PCR was carried out
using the miScript PCR Kit (Qiagen). Experiments were normalized to RNU5A. Results were reported as RQ with respect
to a calibrator sample by using the 2DDCt method.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
Antibodies specific to histone H3, dimethyl H3K4, dimethyl
H3K9 (Abcam), DNMT1 (Imgenex), and trimethyl H3K27 (from
Dr. Thomas Jenuwein, Institute of Molecular Pathology,
Austria; ref. 31) were used to capture protein–DNA complexes.
Rabbit and mouse immunoglobins (IgG) were used for isotype
controls. Results were generated by qRT-PCR carried out in
triplicate, using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems). Primer sequences and PCR conditions are available on request. Results were quantified using a 2DDCt method.
CpG cluster prediction
The enrichment for CpG dinucleotides were predicted using
the online sliding window algorithm CpGPlot in the EMBOSS
package from EMBL-EBI (32).

DNA methylation analysis
DNA was isolated from cell lines and tumor samples by a
standard phenol–chloroform extraction. DNA was modified
using the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit (Zymo Research),
and 50 ng of modified DNA was used for PCR in COBRA or
bisulfite sequencing. PCR products were cloned into the pCR
4-TOPO Vector (Invitrogen), and 10 clones per promoter
were sequenced (Sequetech). The promoter regions of the
miRNAs studied are upstream of the pre-miRNA transcript
(þ1); miR-200b 3,318 to 2,978 (20 CpGs), miR-200c
1,301 to 920 (16 CpGs), and miR-205 467 to 175 (3
CpGs). Primer sequences and PCR conditions are available

assays were done according to the protocol, and serum
containing growth media of the respective cell lines were
used as a chemoattractant for 24 hours.

Decitabine and trichostatin A treatment
Cells were treated in duplicate as follows: vehicle (0.6 mL
ethanol in 10 mL medium), trichostatin A (TSA; Sigma), 300
nmol/L for 18 hours, or decitabine (DAC; Sigma), 500 nmol/L
for 96 hours, with fresh medium containing the drug changed
every 24 hours.

Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean  SEM. Correlation of the
quantitative data was determined using the Pearson correlation coefficient among the different normalized expression
values. Statistical significance was P < 0.05.

Transfections
Cells were seeded at 70% confluency. After 24 hours, cells
were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with
miRNA or control mimics (Applied Biosystems). Plasmids for
stable expression of miR-200c and miR-205 were purchased
from Cell Biolabs and cotransfected with linear hygromycin
selection marker (Clontech). The pSilencer2.1 (Ambion) siRNA
expression vector with hygromycin resistance was used for
stable gene knockdown.

transformation assessed by growth in soft agar (25). Moreover, the cells recovered from soft agar (transformed cells)
had acquired a fibroblast-like appearance (Fig. 1A and
Supplementary Fig. S1). HBEC2 cells treated with this combination of tobacco carcinogens for 4, 8, or 12 weeks were
compared with the transformed cell line. After 4 weeks of
exposure to MNU/BPDE, HBEC2 had acquired a fibroblastlike mesenchymal appearance consistent with EMT. The
mesenchymal-like morphology remained throughout the
remaining 8 weeks of treatment and persisted after removal
of the carcinogens at all time points and in transformed cells
(Fig. 1A). Transformation efficiency was greatest in HBEC2
treated with MNU/BPDE; therefore, this cell line was
selected for detailed temporal characterization of the
mechanisms underlying the changes in their growth pattern.
HBEC1 MNU/BPDE-transformed cells were used to confirm
studies related to EMT.
In vitro motility and invasion assays were used to determine
whether the induction of EMT affected the motility and
invasive potential of the transformed cells. Although EMT

was evident after 4 weeks of carcinogen exposure, only the
transformed cells were migratory and invasive compared with
untreated HBEC2 (Fig. 1B). The molecular hallmark of EMT is
decreased expression of E-cadherin and KRT19, and expression of these genes was reduced 99- and 8-fold after 4 weeks
and 659- and 474-fold in HBEC2-transformed cells (Fig. 2,
Supplementary Fig. S2, and Table 1). An increase in expression
was seen for the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin (150- to
237-fold), vimentin (6- to 7-fold), and fibronectin (1- to 21-fold)
over 4 to 12 weeks (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. S2, and Table 1).
Expression of the EMT-inducing transcription factors ZEB1,
ZEB2, Snail1, and Twist1 were significantly increased 2- to
1,418-fold at week 4 and 5- to 2,219-fold in transformed HBEC2
cells (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. S2, and Table 1). HBEC1transformed cells exhibited reduced expression of epithelial
markers E-cadherin and KRT19 (2- to 5-fold), increased
expression of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, vimentin,
and fibronectin (2- to 19-fold), and increased expression of
EMT-inducing transcription factors ZEB1, ZEB2, Snail1, and
Twist1 (3- to 109-fold; Table 1). Expression of the miRNAs

regulating EMT (miR-200b, miR-200c, and miR-205) was
reduced 4- to 12-fold at 4 weeks and 10- to 55-fold in the
HBEC2-transformed cell line (Fig. 3A). A 2-fold reduction in
expression of these miRNAs was also seen in HBEC1-transformed cells (Table 1). Transient overexpression of miR-200b,
miR-200c, or miR-205 in HBEC2-transformed cells did not
induce a morphologic mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition
(MET). However, reexpression of these miRNAs with mature
mimics in HBEC2-transformed cells prevented growth in soft
agar (Fig. 4A). Expression of E-cadherin increased 85- and 68fold with transient expression of miR-200b and miR-200c,
respectively, while a modest increase in expression (1.2-fold)
was seen following transfection of miR-205 (Fig. 4B). These
findings were replicated in HBEC2-transformed cells with
stable integration and expression of miR-200c and miR-205
(not shown; not tested for miR-200b because the construct
was not available). Although knockdown of ZEB1, ZEB2,
Snail1, and Twist1 or combinations (ZEB1/ZEB2, ZEB1/Snail1,
ZEB1/Twist1, ZEB2/Snail1, ZEB2/Twist1, and Snail1/Twist1)
in HBEC2-transformed cells did not induce morphologic MET,
transformation was reversed as reflected by a dramatic reduction in the number and size of the colonies in soft agar
(Supplementary Table S1).
Transformed HBECs acquire stem cell–like features
The induction of EMT has been associated with the acquisition of stem cell–like features that include nonadherent
growth and change in expression of cell-surface glycoproteins
(33, 34). Therefore, we analyzed the ability of the transformed

versus HBEC2 treated for 4, 8, or 12 weeks with carcinogens to
grow in a laminin-rich growth factor–reduced Matrigel assay
indicative of a nonadherent growth property of cancer stemlike/tumor progenitor cells. Although EMT was present after
4 weeks of carcinogen treatment, only the 12-week treated
cells grew from single cells into small aggregate colonies and
formed spherical structures 50 mm in diameter by the 10th
day. Moreover, the transformed cells formed large spheroids
100 mm or greater with branching tubules, an in vitro characteristic of invasive cells (Fig. 5A). Reexpression of miR-200b
or miR-200c with mature mimics in the transformed cells
prevented growth in Matrigel (Fig. 5B). In contrast, transformed cells with transient expression of miR-205 grew as
small aggregate colonies forming spheroids (50 mm in diameter) but did not form branching tubules. A similar growth
pattern in the transformed cells with stable expression of miR200c and miR-205 was observed (not shown). The stem cell–
like phenotype of HBEC2 and HBEC1 was further characterized by assessing the expression of recently reported stem cell
surface markers CD44, CD24, CD133, and ALDH1 (29, 33, 35).
The CD44high/CD24low cell population was absent in HBEC2
and HBEC1. In marked contrast, after only 4 weeks of carcinogen exposure, the CD44high/CD24low cell population had
increased by approximately 14%, with a striking increase in
approximately 73% of the HBEC2-transformed cells displaying
this stem cell marker (Fig. 5C and D and Table 1). Interestingly,
the transformed cells with stable reexpression of miR-200c
and miR-205 retained the stem cell CD44high/CD24low cell
population (65% and 82%, respectively). The CD133 marker

ALDH1 was detected in less than 1% and 9% of HBEC1- and
HBEC2-transformed cells, respectively. CD44high/CD24low,
CD133, and ALDH1 were also present in 1% to 82% of lung
cancer cell lines; however, stem cell surface markers were not
associated with expression changes of the EMT markers
(Fig. 5C and D and Table 1).
Epigenetic silencing of miR-205 and miR-200 family
The regulatory regions of miR-200b and miR-200c contain
CpG-rich sequences. The recently characterized promoter of
miR-200b has a CpG island (length 2,541, % GC 65.0, O/E ratio
0.69, 183 CpGs). The miR-200c promoter resides within a CpGenriched region (length 1,796, % GC 50, O/E ratio 0.60, 66
CpGs). In contrast, the regulatory region of miR-205 is nearly
devoid of CpGs. HBEC2-transformed cells were treated with
the demethylating agent DAC or histone deacetylase inhibitor
TSA to assess the impact of cytosine DNA methylation and
chromatin remodeling on the expression of these miRNAs.

3092

Cancer Res; 71(8) April 15, 2011

DAC induced robust reexpression (4- to 7-fold) of each miRNA,
whereas expression increased 2- to 3-fold with TSA (Fig. 3A).
Bisulfite sequencing revealed a small increase in CpG methylation in these promoters at week 4 (3%–16%) that increased
to 27% to 42% in the transformed cell line (Fig. 3B). The steady
increase in hypermethylation was associated with a more
profound reduction in expression of the miRNAs. Following
treatment with DAC, the transformed cells showed nearcomplete demethylation (10% methylation remaining) of
CpGs within these miRNA promoters that was associated
with up to a 7-fold increase in expression. The 4- to 12-fold
reduction in expression of these miRNAs in conjunction with
16% or less CpG promoter methylation after 4 weeks of
carcinogen exposure suggests that histone modifications
may contribute to their transcriptional silencing. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation coupled to qRT-PCR was used to investigate changes in active and repressive histone marks. The
H3K4me2 (indicative of active/open chromatin) mark was
absent at the promoters of these miRNAs during carcinogen

H3K27me3 (indicative of inactive/closed chromatin) was
enriched 14- to 30-fold at week 4 but declined dramatically
to 0.7- to 7-fold by week 8 (Fig. 6). The occupancy of H3K9me2
(inactive/closed chromatin mark) was 0.3- to 1-fold at week 4
and increased up to 8-fold in transformed cells. Enrichment of
DNMT1 at these miRNA promoters was observed at week 4,
with the highest level of occupancy observed at week 12
(Fig. 6).
Markers of EMT in lung cancer cells
Established lung cancer cell lines Calu6 and A549 display
morphologic features of EMT reflected by reduced expression
of E-cadherin and KRT19 that is associated with methylation
of miR-200b, miR-200c, and miR-205 (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). The lung cancer cell lines H1435 and HCC827
have an epithelial morphology associated with normal levels
of E-cadherin, KRT19, miR-200b, miR-200c, and miR-205
expression (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). COBRA
was used to evaluate the methylation status of these miRNAs
in HBEC1-transformed cells, lung cancer cell lines, and bronchial epithelial cells. Reduced expression of miR-200b, miR200c, and miR-205 was strongly correlated with hypermethylation of these promoters in HBEC1-transformed cells and was
associated with an EMT phenotype (Table 1). Cancer-specific
methylation within the promoter of miR-200b, miR-200c, and
miR-205 was found in 69%, 54%, and 92% of lung cancer cell
lines, respectively (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2),
whereas no methylation was detected in bronchial epithelial
cells (Supplementary Table S3). Bisulfite sequencing detected
dense methylation in Calu6 cells (64%–98%) that correlated
with reduced miRNA expression and modest enrichment of
H3K27me3, H3K9me2, and DNMT1 (Figs. 3 and 6). In contrast,
miR-200b and miR-200c were sparsely methylated (4%) and
highly expressed in H1435 cells (Fig. 3). Moderate methylation
(21% of CpGs) and lower expression of miR-205 were seen in
H1435, along with enrichment of H3K27me3, H3K9me2, and
DNMT1 (Figs. 3 and 6). The expression of E-cadherin and
ZEB1 reflected the methylation and expression status of these

www.aacrjournals.org

miRNAs in lung cancer cell lines (Table 1). A recent study (36)
reported cell-type–specific methylation of miR-200c in fibroblasts, suggesting differential regulation in this cell type.
Primary tumors are heterogeneous and contain stromal cells
consisting of fibroblasts, endothelial, and inflammatory cells.
Assessing the prevalence of DNA methylation in these miRNAs
from primary blood lymphocytes (WBCs) revealed extensive
and frequent methylation of these promoters (Supplementary
Table S3), an effect that may support the nonadherent properties of this circulating cell population. The high prevalence for
methylation in stromal cells confounds the evaluation of
promoter methylation of these miRNAs in primary lung
tumors. As an alternative approach, qRT-PCR was used to
investigate miRNA expression patterns in 24 primary lung
carcinomas relative to distant normal lung tissue (Supplementary Table S4). Reduced expression of at least one miRNA
was observed in 9 of 24 (38%) primary lung tumors. The
expression of miR-200b and miR-200c was significantly correlated (r ¼ 0.595, P ¼ 0.002). The EMT markers ZEB1 (r ¼
0.365, P ¼ 0.07) and KRT19 (r ¼ 0.396, P ¼ 0.05) were
associated with reduced expression of miR-200b, suggesting
that EMT is a feature of some nonmetastatic lung tumors.

Discussion
These studies show that the exposure of immortalized
HBECs to tobacco carcinogens rapidly induces a multifaceted
dedifferentiation program characterized by EMT and stemlike properties. The induction of EMT is epigenetically driven,
initially by chromatin remodeling with ensuing promoter DNA
methylation sustaining stable silencing of the miRNAs implicated in this developmental program. Finally and of great
importance is the finding that the regulation of EMT morphology, induction of stem cell–like phenotype, and transformation are distinct events in response to carcinogen exposure.
EMT occurs during embryogenesis to support tissue remodeling and has been proposed as a key step in the metastasis of
epithelial tumors (9, 37). Experimental models to characterize
the genotypic and phenotypic changes of EMT during tumor

invasion have used ectopic expression of transcription factors
such as Twist or Snail or, alternatively, stimulation of these
transcription factors by the growth factors TGF-b and TNF-a,
which are present in the tumor microenvironment (14, 22).
Abrogating the increased expression of these transcription
factors induced MET and reversed phenotypic (growth in soft
agar) and gene expression changes (e.g., E-cadherin and miR200 family) linked to this developmental program. Our studies
offer new insight into the role and regulation of EMT in lung
carcinogenesis. We show that EMT can be induced by DNA
damage generated from carcinogens present within tobacco
smoke. An attribute of this premalignancy model is the ability
to define the timing of events occurring during carcinogen
exposure. Although EMT was induced after 4 weeks, these
cells failed to exhibit enhanced proliferative and invasive
phenotypes (growth in soft agar and Matrigel). Rather, after
12 weeks of carcinogen exposure, HBEC2 became highly
enriched for the CD44high/CD24low stem cell marker and

3094

transformed cells exhibited nonadherent growth associated
with invasive properties of branching morphogenesis and
increased migration and invasion. Interestingly, the acquisition of this stem cell–like feature is not required for the
enhanced proliferative and invasive properties displayed by
the transformed HBECs. This conclusion is based on the fact
that stable overexpression of miR-200c or miR-205 reverses
branching morphogenesis and nonadherent growth of the
transformed cells without reducing the population of cells
enriched for the CD44high/CD24low cell marker or changing
the morphology (EMT to MET). These results may reflect the
multitude of signaling networks regulating EMT (e.g., Wnt
and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling) that are likely
impacted by carcinogen exposure (24, 38). Thus, the deregulation of pathways controlling cell morphology, miRNAs,
transcriptional regulators, and phenotype associated with
EMT are not always coordinately regulated. This conclusion
is further substantiated by the extension of our findings in

Carcinogens Induce Epigenetic Silencing of miRNAs

this model of premalignancy to malignant lung tumor–
derived cell lines and primary tumors. The plasticity of
EMT is clearly evident on the basis of the fact that some
cancer cell lines display many of the hallmarks of EMT:
reduced expression of E-cadherin and requisite miRNAs and
increased expression of ZEB1 while exhibiting an epithelial
rather than a mesenchymal morphology. Nonmetastatic
primary lung tumors also displayed features of EMT as

evident by the reduced expression of miRNAs in our study.
Interestingly, Yanagawa and colleagues (39) showed that
increased expression of Snail in adenocarcinoma was associated with poor prognosis and heterogeneous E-cadherin
expression, with a greater reduction seen in the poorly
differentiated component of the tumors. Together, these
findings extend the role of EMT from cancer metastasis
to initiation and progression of lung cancer.

Tellez et al.

The histone methyltransferase EZH2 along with EED and
SUZ12 comprises the polycomb repressive complex 2 to
catalyze the repressive trimethylation mark at lysine 27 of
histone H3 (H3K27me3). Stem cells rely on polycomb group
proteins to reversibly repress genes encoding transcription
factors required for differentiation (40). Several recent studies
support the hypothesis of a stem cell signature in cancer in
which differentiated cells undergoing transformation acquire
stem cell characteristics through a process of dedifferentiation
by enrichment of the H3K27me3 and de novo cytosine DNA
methylation (41). This scenario was observed during transformation of HBECs in which carcinogen exposure first led to
a reduction in expression of these EMT-regulating miRNAs by
recruitment of H3K27me3, followed by epigenetic switching in
which this histone modification was replaced by cytosine DNA
methylation within the miRNA promoters. Epigenetic switching has recently been described for genes in a prostate cancer
cell line (42).
Substantial evidence linking DNA damage to the acquisition
of epigenetic silencing via chromatin remodeling and cytosine
DNA methylation is now emerging. One factor contributing to
aberrant de novo cytosine DNA methylation during DNA
damage is the rapid recruitment of DNMT1 to sites of DNA
damage (43). Le Gac and colleagues (44) found that in cells
treated with doxorubicin that induces double-strand breaks,
DNMT1 is recruited by activated p53 and binds to functional
Sp1 sites within promoters of the survivin, CDC2, and CDC25
genes. Moreover, the transcriptional repressor HDAC1 and the
repressive chromatin marker H3K9me2 were also found at
these promoters following DNA damage (44, 45). Cuozzo and
colleagues (46) provide stronger support for a mechanistic link
between DNA damage and DNA methylation. In that study, a
recombinant plasmid containing a 1-Sce1 restriction site
within one copy of two inactivated tandem repeated green
fluorescent protein (GFP) genes was introduced into HeLa or
mouse embryonic stem cells. The restriction endonuclease
1-Sce1 was added to the cells to induce a double-strand
break in the GFP gene at this site. Rapid gene silencing
associated with homologous recombination and DNA
methylation of GFP was seen and could be blocked by
treatment with DAC. The initiation of epigenetic silencing

in our study of miR-200b, miR-200c, and miR-205 by trimethylation of H3K27 provides another link between chromatin remodeling and transcriptional repression in
response to DNA damage. Finally, our previous study
revealed that reduced DNA repair capacity is associated
with increased gene promoter methylation in the aerodigestive tract of smokers (47). Collectively, these findings
provide both in vitro and in vivo support for a major role of
tobacco carcinogens in affecting epigenetic regulation of
miRNAs and genes involved in lung carcinogenesis.
Our model of tobacco carcinogen–induced premalignancy
shows temporally that initiation of EMT occurs after just
4 weeks of carcinogen exposure, followed by the acquisition of
other stem cell–like traits: spheroids with branching tubules
and a marked enrichment for stem cell–like markers
CD44high/CD24low and/or CD133/ALDH1 in HBEC-transformed cells. However, in spite of displaying in vitro characteristics of highly invasive cells, the HBEC-transformed cell
lines did not grow orthotopically in nude mice (25). The ability
to confer a complete malignant and metastatic phenotype has
been associated with the presence of EMT, K-ras, and p53
mutations in murine cell lines (9). Mutation of the K-ras and
p53 genes, generally late events in tumor development (48, 49),
was not observed in carcinogen-treated HBECs (25). However,
our in vitro model establishes a link between tobacco carcinogen exposure, epigenetic induction of EMT, and the development of stem cell–like phenotype that together may represent
some of the early events driving the clonal expansion of
premalignant lung cells.
