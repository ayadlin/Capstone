BACKGROUND: Lenalidomide is approved for the treatment of anemia with transfusion dependence (TD) in patients with lower-risk
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with 5q deletion (del5q-MDS), but its “real-life” use and effect on transfusion needs are unclear. In
the current study, the authors examined its use in the Medicare population. METHODS: Patients with MDS who were enrolled in Medicare Parts A, B, and D were identified using International Classification of Diseases 9-Clinical Modification (ICD-9) codes from 100%
Medicare claims from 2006 through 2008. Patients were followed until the end of the study or death. Claims were used to determine
time to initiation of lenalidomide, daily dose, duration, and other MDS therapies. Transfusion status was defined each week based on
transfusion use in rolling 8-week period: TD, required transfusions during 2 weeks, separated by  3 weeks; transfusion user (TU), 1
transfusion; and transfusion independence (TI), no transfusions. RESULTS: A total of 753 of 23,855 patients (3.2%) received lenalidomide, including 31% of 470 patients with del5q-MDS. At the time of lenalidomide initiation, 33% of patients were TD, 31% were TU,
and 36% were TI. The median time to lenalidomide initiation was shorter for patients with del5q-MDS than for other lower-risk
patients (8 weeks vs 20 weeks; P <.01). The percentage of patients with del5q-MDS receiving lenalidomide increased over time. Lenalidomide initiation was found to be negatively associated with older age and baseline diabetes, stroke, and renal disease. During the
observation period, 44% of TU=TD patients (53% of the patients with del5q-MDS) achieved reductions in transfusion use; among TD
patients receiving  3 cycles, 77% reduced their transfusion use and 40% achieved TI. CONCLUSIONS: To the authors’ knowledge, the
current study is the first report of lenalidomide use in a large Medicare-enrolled population with MDS. Reductions in transfusion rates
were overall consistent with data from clinical trials. Response rates were higher when  3 lenalidomide cycles were received. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Anemia that requires transfusions represents a significant problem for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
Historically, the primary therapeutic strategy was supportive care with red blood cell (RBC) transfusions and
erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). The addition of 3 new therapies, the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors
(DNMTi) azacitidine and decitabine and the immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide, to the MDS therapeutic armamentarium has been a major advancement.
Lenalidomide is a potent oral derivative of thalidomide that is active in several hematologic malignancies. Patients with
lower-risk (LR) MDS with chromosome 5q deletions (del5q-MDS) are highly responsive to lenalidomide. In clinical trials,
lenalidomide induced RBC transfusion independence (TI) in approximately two-thirds of these patients, and complete cytogenetic responses in some patients.1,2 Lenalidomide was approved by the US Food and Drug administration in December
2005 for use in patients with transfusion-dependent (TD) anemia due to LR del5q-MDS with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.3-5 Lenalidomide also induced TI in 26% of patients with LR MDS without del5q.5 Current treatment
guidelines recommend consideration of lenalidomide therapy in some patients with TD LR MDS without 5q deletion.6

Lenalidomide in MDS: Real-Life Use/Zeidan et al

MDS was identified by a single ICD-9-CM diagnostic
code (238.7) until October 2006, when a fifth digit was
added that allowed for classification by patient MDS risk
status. The ICD-9-CM code 238.72 identified patients
with LR MDS, code 238.74 identified patients with
del5q-MDS, and code 238.73 was used for patients with
HR MDS. Diagnostic codes 238.7 and 238.75 were
grouped together as not otherwise specified (NOS).
Studied Variables

Figure 1. Generation of the database and the specific cohort
of the study is shown. MDS indicates myelodysplastic syndromes; ICD-9, International Classification of Diseases 9Clinical Modification; w=o, without; LIS, low-income subsidy.

Patient characteristics (age at diagnosis, race, and sex)
were determined from Medicare enrollment files. Receipt
of the Medicare Part D low-income subsidy (LIS) was
captured based on monthly enrollment indicators. Sociodemographic factors from the 2000 US Census were
linked to the enrollment files by ZIP code of residence.9
Baseline Health Status

A similar percentage of patients with higher-risk (HR)
del5q-MDS develop TI, but responses are typically shorter
than those among patients with LR del5q-MDS.3-5
Despite accumulating evidence supporting the use
of lenalidomide therapy in some MDS subtypes, data
regarding patterns of use and effectiveness in the “realworld” setting, i.e outside of the context of clinical trials,
are to the best of our knowledge scarce.7,8 To address this
issue, we conducted a retrospective observational study
using a large, 100% Medicare-enrolled, claims-based
MDS database to characterize lenalidomide use and the
effects on RBC transfusion use.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population

Medicare beneficiaries with MDS were selected using
100% Medicare enrollment and claims data from 2006
through 2008. Claims for Medicare Parts A, B, and D
included detailed information regarding dates; International Classification of Diseases 9-Clinical Modification
(ICD-9-CM) diagnoses; and services provided based on
ICD-9-CM procedure codes, Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes, and=or National
Drug Codes (NDC). Inclusion required 1 inpatient
claim or 2 outpatient claims with a MDS diagnosis
within a 12-month span. Patients were observed from
the date of their first MDS claim (index date) through
death or study end (December 31, 2008). To ensure the
observation of the use of all oral therapies, the cohort
was also limited to patients continuously enrolled in
Medicare Part D from the index date through the end of
the study (Fig. 1). All MDS risk groups were included.

Baseline comorbidities were defined based on claims during the 12 months before the diagnosis of MDS was
made. We included an indicator for poor predicted disability status (DS), a weighted claims-based measure
recently described by Davidoff et al.10
MDS Therapies

Prescribed treatments were identified from HCPCS or
NDC codes in the Medicare Part B claims or Part D event
files. We specified lenalidomide treatment episodes as periods of continuous claims with < 6 months between fills.
We calculated the duration of lenalidomide use (first to last
claim plus days supplied), daily dose, time from MDS diagnosis to the initiation of lenalidomide treatment, and time
until discontinuation. Small gaps in therapy were smoothed
through a series of logical imputations. For example, when
observing monthly fills of 14 or 21 tablets, we assumed that
each fill covered a 28-day period and we adjusted days supplied and average daily dose measures accordingly. We also
measured use of DNMTi, ESAs, and RBC transfusions.
Transfusion Status and Response

We measured transfusion status weekly based on a rolling
8-week period (current and prior 7 weeks). Patients with
 2 transfusion weeks with a gap of  2 weeks were designated as TD. Patients with only 1 transfusion episode in
the 8 weeks were designated as transfusion users (TU),
whereas those who received no transfusions were designated as TI. To measure response to treatment, we
selected patients who were TD or TU at the time of lenalidomide initiation, and scanned subsequent weekly transfusion status measures during the first episode of therapy
to identify changes from baseline. We categorized

Lenalidomide Use

During the 3-year observation period (2006-2008), lenalidomide was prescribed to 753 patients with MDS
(3.2%), 19.8% of whom had del5q-MDS and 24.2% of
whom had other LR MDS (Table 2); others had HR or
unclassified MDS. The percentage of patients with del5qMDS treated with lenalidomide increased over time
(32.2% in first 6 months of 2006 to 37.6% in first 6
months of 2008; rates of use for beneficiaries diagnosed in
the latter one-half of 2008 were not reported due to inadequate follow-up to assess use). The median time from
3873

Original Article

diagnosis to the initiation of lenalidomide was 11.5 weeks
(range, 0 weeks-132 weeks) for new users; the time to initiation was shorter for patients with del5q-MDS compared with other patients with LR MDS (8 weeks vs 20
weeks; P < .01). Among patients who received lenalidomide, 72.3% had received a prior ESA and 11.7% had
received a prior DNMTi. Approximately 56.4% of lenalidomide users received ESA treatment concurrently with
lenalidomide, whereas 29.0% received ESAs after discontinuing lenalidomide.
Prior use of other MDS therapies tended to be lower
for patients with del5q-MDS compared with those with
other LR MDS, which is consistent with a shorter time to
the initiation of lenalidomide. The mean number of 4week cycles for all patients was 4.1 (median, 2 cycles;
range 0.4 cycles-29.8 cycles), with 34.3% of patients
receiving > 3 cycles. In contrast, patients with del5qMDS received a mean of 5.1 treatments with 4-week lenalidomide cycles (median, 3 treatments; range, 1
treatment-29.8 treatments), with 44.7% of patients
receiving > 3 cycles. The median starting daily dose of
lenalidomide was 7.5 mg (mean, 8.1 mg; mode, 10 mg).
Doses tended to be lower in patients with del5q-MDS
compared with other patients with LR MDS, but small
sample sizes precluded statistical comparisons. There was
a trend toward lower doses in the last, compared with first,
treatment periods for individual patients, which is consistent with dose reductions with longer lenalidomide use
(data not shown). Reduction in doses with longer therapy
could reflect dose adjustment for side effects or a reduction to lower effective doses.

thrombocytopenia and high local rates of difficulty in
speaking English also were found to be positively correlated with the prescription of lenalidomide. In contrast,
LIS receipt, sex, ethnicity, area-level education, median
household income, urbanicity, and region of residence
were not found to be associated with lenalidomide
prescription.
Lenalidomide and Transfusion Status

Factors Associated With Lenalidomide
Prescription

Despite the approved indication for lenalidomide in
patients with LR MDS with del5q with TD anemia, 36%
of patients were transfusion-naive (TN; no prior history of
RBC) or TI at the time of lenalidomide initiation, whereas
31% were TU and 33% were TD (Fig. 2 Top). Point estimates indicated that 44% of the patients who were either
TU or TD at the time of lenalidomide initiation (53% of
patients with del5q-MDS) experienced a transfusion
response. Among those who were TD at the time of lenalidomide initiation, 45% experienced a reduction in transfusion use during the observation period, with 15%
achieving TI (Fig. 2 Top). Moreover, 43% of patients
who were TU at the time of lenalidomide initiation (55%
of patients with del5q-MDS) achieved TI status (Fig. 2
Top). When analysis was limited to patients who received
 3 cycles of lenalidomide, 71% of patients who were TU
or TD at the time of lenalidomide initiation (83% of
patients with del5q-MDS) experienced a transfusion
response (Fig. 2 Bottom). Among TD patients who
received  3 lenalidomide cycles, 77% experienced a transfusion response and 40% achieved TI (Fig. 2 Bottom).
Among these more extensively treated patients who were
TU at time of lenalidomide initiation, 67% became TI
(Fig. 2 Bottom). Small sample sizes provided inadequate
power to detect differences between MDS risk groups.

Table 3 presents multivariate logistic regression estimates
for factors associated with lenalidomide use. Lenalidomide initiation was found to be negatively associated with
older age (age  85 years; odds ratio [OR], 0.58 [95%
confidence interval (95% CI), 0.46-0.74]), poor DS (OR,
0.56; 95% CI, 0.41-0.75), baseline diabetes (OR, 0.83;

0.58-0.88), and prior stroke (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.510.91). As expected, the del5q-MDS subtype was found to
be the strongest factor associated with lenalidomide prescription (OR, 15.4; 95% CI, 11.8-20.0 relative to the
reference category of other LR MDS). HR MDS also was
found to be associated with an increased use of lenalidomide (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.26-2.29), whereas the MDSNOS subtype was associated with lower rates of use (OR,
0.73; 95% CI, 0.60-0.89). Baseline pancytopenia and

DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, the current study represents
the first report of lenalidomide use for patients with MDS
in a large population of Part D-enrolled Medicare beneficiaries with newly diagnosed MDS. We are not aware of
other large “real-life” analyses evaluating changes in transfusion status in patients with MDS patients who received
lenalidomide therapy or, in particular, any reports of
patients not enrolled in Medicare. We evaluated patterns
of lenalidomide use and associated changes in RBC transfusion status in a “real-world” setting during the first 3
years after lenalidomide was approved for the treatment of
MDS (2006-2008). As expected, rates of use were highest
among patients with del5q-MDS and the time to lenalidomide initiation was shorter for patients with del5q-

MDS versus those with other LR MDS. These observations suggest general increased awareness of the selective
activity of lenalidomide for patients with del5q-MDS on
the part of prescribing physicians. Reports of hematologic
response in patients with LR MDS without del5q5,12
might account in part for the current study finding that
the majority of patients with MDS (80%) who received
lenalidomide were not coded as having del5q-MDS.
However, this finding, as well as our observation that
patients with del5q-MDS constituted an increasing percentage of lenalidomide users, may be an artifact of the
change in ICD-9-CM coding that occurred 10 months
into our observation period.
3876

The findings of the current study with regard to rates
of lenalidomide use are in contrast with estimates from a
survey of 101 hematology and medical oncology providers
that was completed between June 2005 and January
2007.7 In that study, which spanned the first year after
lenalidomide was approved for the treatment of MDS,
providers reported that 8% of recently diagnosed and 1%
to 9% of established patients with MDS received lenalidomide. However, the study cohort was not limited to Medicare beneficiaries, and did not provide information
regarding risk status, karyotype, or other patient characteristics among lenalidomide users and nonusers.7
In contrast to the labeled indication for TD patients,
approximately one-third of patients with MDS (including
a similar percentage of patients with del5q-MDS) initiated lenalidomide treatment while TI. This apparent
inconsistency with treatment guidelines was also found in
our previous study examining guideline adherence with
regard to ESA use in patients with MDS.13 It is possible
that physicians were privy to clinical parameters suggesting a need for RBC transfusion, and chose to preempt
transfusions by initiating lenalidomide therapy. Absent
clinical measures in our claims data, we are unable to
assess this scenario more definitively.
The negative correlation of advanced age, comorbidities, and poor DS with prescription of lenalidomide that
was observed in our multivariate analysis is discouraging,
because one of the goals of introducing nonintensive
therapies is to allow more frail elderly patients with MDS
with comorbidities to receive active therapy that can be
better tolerated. These findings are consistent with a
recent report of patterns of use of DNMTi among elderly
Medicare beneficiaries with MDS who were followed
through 2007.14 In this study, only 11% of patients with
MDS received DNMTi therapy, and older patients and
those with more comorbidities were found to be less likely
to receive DNMTi. The additional burden of physician
office visits or hospitalization for their administration
may explain the low rates of DNMTi use but, as an oral
agent, lenalidomide should not be subject to these constraints. Instead, the lower rate of lenalidomide use
observed in vulnerable patient populations might reflect a
more cautious approach with a newly approved agent, and
rates of use may increase with improved familiarity.
Contrary to expectations, we did not find strong evidence that socioeconomic status, including LIS receipt,
influenced the initiation of lenalidomide. Lenalidomide is
an expensive oral medication, and therefore beneficiaries
without the LIS are subject to very large initial outof-pocket payments and continued large payments even

when reaching the catastrophic coverage phase. In contrast, those with the LIS pay minimal amounts toward
their initial prescription, and pay nothing once they reach
the catastrophic phase. The lack of an observed effect of
LIS receipt on lenalidomide treatment may suggest that
patients are not price-sensitive . Decreased price response
has been demonstrated in other studies for patients with
cancer,15,16 and the perceived benefits of lenalidomide
may be sufficiently large to justify the payment from the
patient’s perspective. However, patients may face income
constraints that either discourage the initiation of lenalidomide or encourage its early discontinuation. Our ZIP
code-level income measure may not adequately correlate
with person-specific income, and consequently may not
capture an association between income and treatment.
Although the transfusion response rates for the full
cohort in the current study reflected a mix of risk groups
and a relatively short duration of therapy for many
patients, overall they are consistent with data in previously
published clinical trials. In the registration study by List et
al, patients with TD anemia due to MDS with 5q deletions irrespective of karyotype complexity received lenalidomide at a dose of 10 mg daily for 21 days or 28 days of
a 28-day cycle,1 with TI or a reduction in the need for
transfusions noted in 67% and 76% of patients, respectively.1 The randomized phase 3 MDS004 trial suggested
a dose-dependent effect of lenalidomide: with the 10-mg
dose (taken for 21 of 28 days), 56.1% and 50% of
patients, respectively, achieved TI for  26 weeks and
cytogenetic response compared with 42.6% and 25%,
respectively, with the 5-mg dose (taken for 28 of 28
days).2 Lenalidomide has limited activity in patients with
LR MDS without 5q deletions (TI, 26%; median duration, 41 weeks) and HR MDS with 5q deletions (TI,
25.5%; median duration, 26 weeks), with responses typically less frequent and shorter in duration than those
noted in patients with LR MDS with 5q deletions.3-5
Relative to these trial data, we observed that 44% of
all patients with MDS and 53% of patients with del5qMDS who were either TU or TD at the time of lenalidomide initiation experienced a reduction in transfusion
use. For patients who were TD at the time of lenalidomide initiation (all risk groups), 45% experienced a
reduction in RBC transfusions, including 15% who
achieved TI (Fig. 2 Top). When we restricted the analysis
to patients who received  3 cycles of lenalidomide, 71%
of patients who were TU or TD at the time of lenalidomide initiation (all risk groups, including 83% of patients
with del5q-MDS) experienced a reduction in transfusion
use. The patients who were TD at the time of lenalidoCancer

mide initiation (all risk groups) and subsequently received
 3 cycles of therapy had an augmented benefit; 77% had
reductions in transfusions, including 40% who achieved
TI (Fig. 2 Bottom). Small sample sizes provided inadequate power with which to detect differences between
MDS risk subgroups (including those with del5q-MDS vs
other LR MDS) or to compare differences based on lenalidomide dose.
The greater frequency in the reduction of transfusions needed for patients who received  3 cycles of lenalidomide indicates that, in line with current guidelines,6
the therapeutic potential of the drug might require  3
months to be fully achieved in some patients. Conversely,
patients with a longer treatment duration may be enriched
with early responders, which could explain some of our
findings. The current descriptive analysis does not
account for this potential pattern; further research on the
effect of therapy duration on outcomes is warranted.
The main limitations of the current study relate to
the use of claims data to select patient cohorts and to construct valid measures of treatment exposures and transfusion status. MDS risk group was assigned based on ICD9- diagnostic codes on claims, yet many in the cohort did
not have a specific risk group designated. This might be
due to cytogenetic evaluation not being performed in
routine-care settings or, if performed, the results not being
reflected in the coding. As a result, the number of patients
identified as carrying del5q is relatively small, and we recognize that some percentage of those patients designated
as having other LR MDS or MDS-NOS may actually harbor the del5q abnormality. Although we report lenalidomide use patterns stratified by del5q and other LR MDS,
the sample size was not sufficient in either group to test
for differences in treatments or outcomes.
Our measures of lenalidomide and other MDS
therapies were based on claims. For oral medications in
particular we had to presume that the medication was
consumed by the patient. Our measure of erythroid
response was based on changes in transfusion status,
which in turn were based on observed weekly transfusion
receipt. Although we modeled this approach on the International Working Group 2000 definitions of major and
minor responses, we could not fully operationalize them,
absent data on hemoglobin levels.
In addition, our analysis of changes in transfusion
response should be considered descriptive and not causal.
Although it is possible to use observational data to examine
causal relations between lenalidomide and a variety of outcomes, including survival, progression to acute myeloid
leukemia (AML), secondary solid tumor malignancies,
3877

and venous thromboembolism, reporting such outcomes
without adequate controls for other therapies received and
without use of an analytic strategy that addresses patient
selection would be inadequate and possibly misleading.
This type of analysis was outside the scope of the current
study, but is clearly warranted in the future.
In summary, the data from the current study suggest
that in the first 3 years after the approval of lenalidomide
for its MDS indication, prescribing patterns were only
partly consistent with clinical guidelines and the drug
label.6,17 Major deviations were the high percentage of
patients who were TI when the drug was prescribed, high
rates of the concomitant use of lenalidomide with ESAs
and other MDS therapies, and the short duration of treatment episodes for a large percentage of patients. Consistency of prescribing patterns across socioeconomic strata,
including in patients who may incur significant copayments, suggests that MDS-associated anemia presents a
significant clinical problem for patients with MDS. For
those patients who were TD at the time of the initiation
of lenalidomide, therapy appears to have had a positive
impact on transfusion rates, particularly for those receiving at least 3 cycles. This experience suggests that stronger
adherence to treatment guidelines would result in further
improvements in outcomes.
