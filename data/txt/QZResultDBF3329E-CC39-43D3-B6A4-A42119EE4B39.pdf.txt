p73 engages A2B receptor signalling to prime cancer cells
to chemotherapy-induced death
JS Long1, PM Schoonen1,2, D Graczyk1, J O’Prey1 and KM Ryan1
Tumour cells often acquire the ability to escape cell death, a key event leading to the development of cancer. In almost half of all
human cancers, the capability to induce cell death is reduced by the mutation and inactivation of p53, a tumour suppressor protein
that is a central regulator of apoptosis. As a result, there is a crucial need to identify different cell death pathways that could be
targeted in malignancies lacking p53. p73, the closely related p53 family member, can regulate many p53 target genes and
therefore some of the same cellular responses as p53. Unlike p53, however, p73 is seldom mutated in cancer, making it an
attractive, alternative death effector to target. We report here the ability of p73 to upregulate the expression of the A2B receptor,
a recently characterized p53 target that effectively promotes cell death in response to extracellular adenosine—a metabolite that
accumulates during various forms of cellular stress. Importantly, we show that p73-dependent stimulation of A2B signalling
markedly enhances apoptosis in cancer cells that are devoid of p53. This mode of death is caspase- and puma-dependent, and can
be prevented by the overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL. Moreover, treatment of p53-null cancer cells with the chemotherapeutic
drug adriamycin (doxorubicin) induces A2B in a p73-dependent manner and, in combination with an A2B agonist, substantially
enhances apoptotic death. We therefore propose an alternate and distinct p53-independent pathway to stimulate programmed cell
death involving p73-mediated engagement of adenosine signalling.

INTRODUCTION
The prominent tumour suppressor p53 actively protects against cellular
transformation by curbing undesirable propagation of damaged cells.
One of the ways in which p53 functions in this context is by
transactivating genes that execute programmed cell death in response
to harmful cellular stresses such as genomic damage or oncogene
activation.1 However, over half of all human cancers contain mutations
in the p53 gene2 and others have perturbations in pathways required
for p53 activation,3 limiting the beneﬁt of targeting p53 in these
tumour settings. Hence, the discovery of other factors that can
promote cell death in a p53-independent manner is of great interest
and utmost importance in targeting such cancers.
p73, a paralogue of p53 from the same family of transcription
factors, is now known to have important roles in tumorigenesis.4
Owing to alternative promoter usage and C-terminal alternative
splicing, p73 exists in multiple isoforms. Transcription of the gene
from the upstream P1 promoter gives rise to the transactivating
isoforms (TAp73), while transcripts generated from the internal P2
promoter are amino-terminally truncated and lack the transactivation domain (ΔNp73).5,6 Functionally, the TAp73 isoforms closely
mimic p53 in the ability to stimulate transcription of death genes
and to trigger programmed cell death, and have been shown to
be bona ﬁde tumour suppressors.4,7 However, unlike p53, TAp73 is
rarely found to be mutated in cancers,8,9 making it an attractive
target for therapeutic intervention. Indeed, previous studies have
indicated that TAp73 can be activated in cancer to promote
tumour cell death and cause tumour regression.10,11
Extracellular adenosine, the backbone of ATP, is a natural
signalling molecule that activates four cell-surface, G-proteincoupled adenosine receptors. These receptors called A1, A2A, A2B

and A3 signal a diverse range of responses in a variety of cells.12 For
example, adenosine has been shown to regulate neuro-transmission, immune response, vascular permeability and cell viability.12,13
A1, A2A and A3 respond to physiological levels of adenosine in the
nanomolar range.12 By contrast, A2B is only fully activated by
micromolar levels of adenosine that are normally associated with
cells under stressed conditions.12 This can occur under conditions of
metabolic stress such as hypoxia or upon treatment with cytotoxic
drugs.13 Moreover, it has been shown that the extracellular space of
many solid tumours has unusually high levels of adenosine.14–16
Although it is considered that this arises through the enhanced
metabolic stress associated with tumour development, the role of
adenosine in this context is not entirely clear.
We previously identiﬁed ADORA2B (the gene that encodes
A2B) to be a target of p53 that functions to prime cells to die in
response to the accumulation of extracellular adenosine.13 It was
therefore of great interest to investigate whether p73 could also
regulate ADORA2B expression and activate programmed cell
death via this pathway in a manner independent of p53. Here,
we demonstrate the ability of TAp73 to stimulate ADORA2B
expression and function, which enhances p73-dependent cell
death in response to chemotherapy. These ﬁndings reveal an
alternative, p53-independent cell death pathway that could
potentially be exploited for therapeutic intervention.

we investigated whether these different p73 isoforms could
regulate ADORA2B expression. We observed TAp73γ to be a strong
inducer (four- to ninefold) of ADORA2B expression. TAp73α and
TAp73β could also reproducibly induce ADORA2B expression,
albeit to a lesser extent (two- to fourfold) following doxycycline
treatment (Figure 1a). The levels of induction of the TAp73
isoforms upon doxycycline treatment are comparable (Figure 1b),
indicating that the differential regulation of ADORA2B expression
is unlikely due to differences in the TAp73α, TAp73β or TA-p73γ
expression levels. Furthermore, induction of each isoform could
effectively stimulate p21 expression (Figure 1b), a known target
gene of p73,7,18 indicating that all isoforms are functionally
competent. As mentioned earlier, p73 can be transcribed via an
alternative internal promoter, giving rise to isoforms lacking the
transactivation domain, which are collectively termed ΔNp73. We
therefore also examined whether ΔNp73 could regulate ADORA2B
expression, and we found that expression of ΔNp73 does not
affect ADORA2B levels, as demonstrated in Supplementary Figures
S1a and b. We also sought to corroborate the induction of
ADORA2B mRNA at the protein level, but we were unable to
convincingly detect A2B in our cell systems with sufﬁcient clarity.
As TAp73 shares a high degree of sequence homology with
p53 and can therefore bind to p53-responsive elements,6
we examined whether TAp73 may also transactivate ADORA2B
through elements that were previously identiﬁed as potential
p53-binding sites (Figure 1c).13 Indeed, the co-transfection of
TAp73α, TAp73β or TAp73γ with reporter constructs containing
the potential p53-binding elements revealed that TAp73 can
transactivate ADORA2B (Figure 1d). All three TAp73 isoforms were
observed to efﬁciently transactivate binding site ii. We noted,
however, that our luciferase data do not completely parallel our
qRT-PCR for ADORA2B induction as shown in Figure 1a. This may
be due to the fact that the luciferase assay involves isolated
fragments of potential binding sites that are exogenously overexpressed. Therefore, to test more quantitatively whether p73
isoforms bind to this site, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays for the ability of TAp73 isoforms to bind
the endogenous elements examined in our luciferase assays. This
showed that each isoform associates with binding site ii and in
line with our qRT–PCR analysis (Figure 1a), we found that TAp73γ
appeared to bind site ii with a greater afﬁnity than TAp73α and
TAp73β (Figure 1e). As an indication of speciﬁcity, no signiﬁcant
binding was detected using primers that amplify the regions
containing the potential binding sites i, iii, iv and v (Figures 1c and e).
For comparison, we also examined p53 binding by ChIP, which
revealed preferential binding to site ii, indicating that this is the
primary site targeted by both p53 and TAp73 (Supplementary
Figure 1c).
A2B receptor stimulates cell death downstream of p73
p73 is known to induce programmed cell death by activating the
transcription of several p53-responsive pro-apoptotic genes.7,19,20
Therefore, we next asked the question whether p73 induction of
ADORA2B could contribute to programmed cell death downstream
of p73. This was assessed by treating the TetOn-TAp73α, -TAp73β or
-TAp73γ Saos-2 cells with dox in combination with the adenosine
analogue, adenosine-5'-N-ethylcarboxamide (NECA), which binds to
and activates the A2B adenosine receptor. Programmed cell death
was assessed using ﬂow cytometry by measuring the percentage of
propidium iodide-positive cells with subdiploid (sub-G1) DNA
content.21 Upon dox treatment of the TetOn-TAp73α, -TAp73β or
-TAp73γ Saos-2 cells, we observed an increase in the proportion of
cells displaying a sub-G1 fraction, which is in line with the ability of
p73 to stimulate apoptotic cell death (Figure 2a).7,19 Notably,
additional treatment of the cells with NECA resulted in a further
increase in this sub-G1 DNA-containing population in TetOnTAp73β and -TAp73γ, but not -TAp73α Saos-2 cells (Figure 2a).

NECA treatment in the absence of Dox did not increase the
proportion of apoptotic cells when compared with untreated
samples. This indicates that the enhancement in cell death
mediated by NECA following TAp73β and TAp73γ activation results
from the increased expression of A2B by p73, and not from NECA
stimulation of basal levels of A2B.
To conﬁrm that the elevated cell death response following
TAp73β and TAp73γ stimulation in combination with NECA is due
to A2B receptor activation, we employed the use of the
A2B-speciﬁc antagonist, PSB 60322 and RNAi to knockdown A2B
levels. We observed that PSB 603 and A2B knockdown abolishes
the enhancement in cell death by NECA in combination with dox
(Figures 2b–e), conﬁrming the role of A2B in mediating the cell
death response downstream of TAp73β and TAp73γ. However,
PSB 603 did not alter the levels of TAp73β and TAp73γ induced
by dox treatment (Supplementary Figure 2), discounting the
possibility that the inhibition of cell death is attributed to changes
in p73 expression. We also tested the effect of NECA treatment on
the TetOn-ΔNp73 Saos-2 cells but found that the cells do not die
in response to NECA in combination with or without dox
treatment (Supplementary Figures S1d). This was expected since
ΔNp73 does not upregulate ADORA2B expression, as we described
earlier (Supplementary Figure S1a).
p73-A2B receptor mediated cell death is caspase-dependent
We were next interested to further assess the pathways by which
A2B stimulates cell death upon p73 activation. We found that the
pre-treatment of cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk,
completely blocked the cell death response elicited by A2B
signalling downstream of TAp73β and TAp73γ activation
(Figure 3a and b). In addition, we found that stimulation of A2B
signalling downstream of p73 resulted in enhanced PARP
cleavage (Figures 3c and d) and the appearance of cells that
were positive for Annexin V and propidium iodide (Supplementary
Figure S3). This indicates that A2B likely signals to a caspasedependent, apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, western blotting
analyses revealed that this enhanced cell death response by A2B
in combination with TAp73β or TAp73γ activation was accompanied by increased detection of cleaved forms of caspases-9, -8,
-7 and -3 (Figures 3e and f).
Typically, apoptosis can proceed via two different pathways,
that is, the extrinsic/caspase-8-dependent, or the intrinsic-/
caspase-9-dependent pathway.23 Crosstalk between the pathways
has also been reported.24 In an attempt to elucidate the
involvement of either/both of these pathways in mediating the
cell death response by A2B and p73, we sought to separately
inhibit these pathways and examine the effect on A2B-stimulated
death. To attenuate the extrinsic pathway, we ectopically
expressed the cowpox viral protein CrmA, which is a potent
inhibitor of caspase-8,25,26 in the TetOn-TAp73β and -TAp73γ
Saos-2 cells. We observed that the extent of cell death induced by
NECA and TAp73β or TAp73γ was not signiﬁcantly altered by
CrmA (Figures 4a and b). Expression of CrmA, however, effectively
attenuated cell death in response to tumour necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α) and cycloheximide (Supplementary Figure S4a and b), a
combination that triggers caspase-8-dependent apoptosis,27
thereby validating the efﬁcacy of the ectopically expressed viral
protein. To attenuate the intrinsic pathway, we overexpressed the
pro-survival mitochondrial protein Bcl-XL, which counteracts
pro-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins that result in the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane, release of
cytochrome c and activation of caspase-9.28,29 The overexpression
of Bcl-XL was able to prevent the increase in apoptosis caused
by A2B stimulation downstream of TAp73β or TAp73γ
activation (Figures 4c–f), indicating that A2B signals via the
intrinsic apoptosis pathway in this context. In support of this
notion, we also observed an enhanced release of cytochrome

(Supplementary Figure S5). Overexpression of CrmA in combination with Bcl-XL did not further reduce the apoptotic response
stimulated by A2B signalling downstream of p73 (Figures 4g and h

primarily to the intrinsic pathway in this context. In this regard,

it is also important to note that while cleavage of caspase-8 was
observed upon engagement of A2B signalling downstream
of p73 (Figures 3e and f), this was markedly reduced in cells
expressing Bcl-XL (Supplementary Figure S6). This indicates that
caspase-8 cleavage occurs downstream of MOMP as has
previously been reported.30

Levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins are unaltered but
Puma is upregulated in response to A2B signalling downstream
of p73
As we previously observed A2B signalling to regulate changes in
protein levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1 and Puma,13 we decided to
examine the levels of these proteins in response to p73
stimulation of A2B signalling. This revealed that while levels of
Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 were unaltered, Puma expression was
clearly elevated upon TAp73β or TAp73γ activation in combination with NECA (Figure 5a) and this was found to be A2B
dependent (Figure 5b). We also examined levels of pro-apoptotic
Bak, Bax and Noxa, but found these proteins to be unaffected
(Figure 5a).
Oncogene (2015) 5152 – 5162

p73 engages A2B signalling during chemotherapy- and UVinduced cancer cell death
p73, like p53, is known to be activated in response to cellular
stress, such as during genotoxic damage.11 We were therefore
keen to examine whether p73 activation in response to genotoxic
stress could also induce ADORA2B. To test this, we utilized HCT116
cells that are deﬁcient in p53 (HCT116 p53− / −),31 to exclude the
involvement in p53 in any ADORA2B induction responses we may
observe. We challenged the HCT116 p53− / − cells with a panel of
agents known to cause DNA damage and found that adriamycin
(doxorubicin) treatment led to an increase in ADORA2B mRNA
levels (Figure 6a). This corresponded with an increase in TAp73
expression (Figure 6b). To ascertain whether this increase was

by PSB 603 treatment (Figure 6e). Previous studies have also
reported a role for Puma in p73-induced cell death.19,32 In this
regard, we found that cell death enhancement by NECA
did not occur in Puma-null cells indicating that A2B-mediated
cell death is also Puma-dependent (Figure 6f). Importantly,
NECA treatment on its own (in the absence of adriamycin) does
not promote cell death, showing that the p73-A2B pathway
is only engaged upon combined treatment with adriamycin and
NECA (Figure 6e).
We also observed that exposure of our p73-inducible cells to UV
resulted in an accumulation of extracellular adenosine (Figure 7a).
Activation of TAp73β in this context resulted in enhanced cell
death (Figure 7b). Moreover, treatment with PSB603 resulted in a
small, but signiﬁcant decrease in this cell death response,
indicating involvement of A2B in this context (Figure 7b) and
highlighting another cell death situation in which the A2B axis can
be involved.

DISCUSSION
Owing to its important role in tumour suppression and its potent
cell death-inducing potential, p53 has been highlighted as a credible
target for cancer therapy. However, because of the frequent
mutation of p53 in human cancer, strategies to activate p53 are
limited in their applicability. By contrast, the relatively infrequent
inactivation of p73 in cancer makes targeting p73 and its downstream signalling components, a conceivably more promising
approach. To this end, it is critical to understand the ways in which
p73 can induce programmed cell death. In this study, we described
a new signalling pathway that potentiates p73-mediated cancer cell
death via activation of the adenosine receptor, A2B. We identiﬁed
ADORA2B (the gene that encodes A2B) as a new target gene of p73,
which can be induced in response to chemotherapy treatment.
Strikingly, the combined treatment of chemotherapy with an A2B
agonist stimulates more cell death compared with chemotherapy
alone. This prominent response occurs in cells deﬁcient in p53 and

utilizing this may be a beneﬁcial approach for targeting cancers with
deregulated p53 function.
An initial interesting observation from this study is that we
only detected induction of p73 and ADORA2B in response to
adriamycin. This is particularly intriguing, as other studies have
reported p73 induction in response to other drug treatments that
we used in our study.33–38 It may be the case that this is a celltype-speciﬁc effect. However, as we were unable to effectively
detect expression of all TA-p73 isoforms at the protein level, it
could be that other drugs induce p73 post-transcriptionally in our
cells. If this were the case, it still remains that the only drug that
induces ADORA2B mRNA in our cells is adriamycin. It is also
possible therefore that adriamycin causes post-translational
modiﬁcations to p73, which facilitate ADORA2B induction, or that

adriamycin induces other factors that cooperate with p73 to
induce ADORA2B. Whatever the mechanism(s) involved for the
selective induction of ADORA2B, it is without question that this is
an area worthy of future investigation.
Similar to what we previously observed with A2B signalling
downstream of p53,13 p73 stimulation of A2B results in a caspaseand Puma-dependent apoptotic cell death. In line with the Puma
dependency and similar to what we observed for p53, death from
p73 in the presence of adenosine can be repressed by overexpression of Bcl-XL, but not by crmA. This indicates that death
proceeds via the mitochondrial pathway without involvement of
caspase 8. The engagement of the mitochondrial pathway as a
result of p73-mediated stimulation of A2B signalling appears,
however, to be different to when A2B signalling is activated by

p53. We observed that stimulation of A2B signalling by p73
involves upregulation of Puma, but Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL do not appear
to be downregulated upon A2B activation as was the case
downstream of p53.13 This difference may suggest that other
factors that are activated by p53, but not p73, are responsible for
the downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. This may also imply that
the downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL alone may not be solely
responsible for p53-A2B stimulation of cell death, but that it is
more the actual balance and interaction between pro- and antiapoptotic mitochondrial proteins that eventually determines the
fate of cells. As a result, this would suggest that activation of A2B
signalling by p53 and p73 may result in an additive response
through the combined effect on different members of the Bcl-2
family.
In addition to the observed differences in the way p53 and p73
engage adenosine signalling, it was also interesting to see that
the cellular response upon stimulation of A2B following activation
by p73 was isoform-speciﬁc. While all three isoforms of p73 could
induce ADORA2B expression, agonist stimulation of A2B only
enhances death in response to TAp73β and TAp73γ, but not
TAp73α. Previous reports have shown that TAp73β and TAp73γ
are, in their own right, much better inducers of cell death than
TAp73α.19 This may be due to the fact that different target genes
are activated by each of the isoforms due to differences in
transcriptional activity as has previously been reported.39,40 Thus,
certain TAp73β- and/or TAp73γ-induced genes may co-operate
in cell death induction upon stimulation of A2B signalling.
Oncogene (2015) 5152 – 5162

Conversely, it may also be the case that TAp73α, but not TAp73β
and TAp73γ, activates gene(s) that promote survival and therefore
antagonize cell death responses downstream of A2B. Lastly, of
course, it must also be considered that when TAp73α activates
A2B this is not part of a cell death response at all. It remains
possible that cellular responses other than cell death, which were
not examined in this study, could be stimulated by A2B signalling
induced in this context. Whatever the reasons for these
differences in the response to A2B activation, the differential
regulation of A2B function by p73 isoforms is undoubtedly
fascinating and warrants further in-depth exploration.
Despite these open questions, the ﬁndings from this study
certainly corroborate an important conclusion—p73 can engage
A2B receptor signalling to trigger cancer cell death in cells
exposed to chemotherapeutic drug treatments or agents such as
UV, which cause accumulation of extracellular adenosine. As this
occurs in the absence of p53, this potentially opens up situations
in which modulation of this pathway could be considered as a
potential target for cancer therapy. It must be noted, however,
that through our analysis of cBioportal for Cancer Genomics
(www.cBioportal.org)41,42 and The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute’s COSMIC (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cancergenome/projects/
cosmic/)43 databases we observed that allelic loss of ADORA2B has
been reported in tumours of lung, ovarian, breast and large
intestine among others (Supplementary Figure S7). This indicates
that ADORA2B may be a tumour suppressor gene and its
connection to cell death pathways downstream of p53 and p73
would certainly support this possibility. If future studies prove this
to be the case, then proﬁling of ADORA2B status may well be
prudent in therapeutic situations, which are thought to involve
accumulation of extracellular adenosine.

Real-time PCR quantiﬁcation of immunoprecipitated DNA fragments
For ChIP experiments, the input and immunoprecipitated samples were
assayed by quantitative PCR. PCR reactions contained 2 μl of DNA template
and 300 nM of each primer. Quantitative PCR was performed on a BioRad
(Hemel Hempstead, UK) CFX 96 units using a 3-min incubation at 95 °C,
followed by 40 cycles of 20 s at 95 °C, 20 s at 57 °C (58 °C for region (i)
primers) and 20 s at 72 °C (with a plate read after each cycle). The primer
sequences used are described in the table below. Data were processed in
BioRad CFX Manager 3.0. Occupancy values are expressed as a corrected
immunoprecipitation efﬁciency (% IP/Input [target antibody] − (% IP/Input

formaldehyde to a ﬁnal concentration of 1% for 8 min at RT, followed by
the addition of glycine to a ﬁnal concentration of 125 mM. Cells were lysed
in 1 ml ChIP buffer (150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5%
NP-40, 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5)) containing 1.5 × protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo, Renfrew, UK) by passing through a 26-G
needle. Nuclei were spun and lysed in 0.5 ml ChIP buffer supplemented
with 0.5% SDS and 1 mM sodium butyrate. The lysate was sonicated ﬁve
times for 30 s with 30 s intervals in the Diagenode Bioruptor (Diagenode,
Seraing, Belgium) set to maximum power. Seventy-ﬁve microlitres of
extract was saved for Input. One hundred and ﬁfty microlitres of extract
was diluted ﬁve times with ChIP buffer (with no SDS) and used for IP. For
each IP 3 μg of antibody was added. The antibody used for p73 ChIPs were
rabbit Anti-HA (A190-108A, Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX, USA) and
normal rabbit IgG (X0903, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) as a negative control;
for p53 ChIP, Anti-p53 (DO-1, BD Pharmingen) and mouse Anti-HA (05–904,
Upstate, Millipore, Watford, UK) as a negative control. Following overnight
incubation at 4 °C with rotation, 50 μl of Protein G magnetic beads (Dynal Life
Technologies, Paisley, UK) was added and further incubated for 6 h. Beads
were washed once with ChIP buffer, once with high salt buffer (500 mM NaCl,

Cytochrome c release assay
The assay for measuring cytochrome c release was adapted from
previously described method by Waterhouse and Trapani.49 In brief,
adherent and non-adherent cells were collected by trypsinization and
collected with 50 μg/ml digitonin (in PBS containing 100 mM potassium
chloride and 1 mM EDTA) for 10 min on ice. Cells were subsequently
washed with ice-cold PBS, ﬁxed in paraformaldehyde (4% in PBS) on ice for
20 min and incubated in blocking buffer (2% BSA in PBS) for 30 min at
room temperature. Cells were then incubated with 1:200 anti-cytochrome
c antibody (Clone 6H2.B4, Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA) overnight at 4 °C.
The next day, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 1:200 antimouse-Alexa 488 antibody (A11001, Life technologies) for 1 h at room
temperature. Finally, cells were washed with PBS before ﬂow cytometry
analysis in FL-1 channel.

Adenosine measurement by liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry
Measurement of extracellular adenosine in conditioned media of UV-treated
cells were performed as previously described.13 In brief, the conditioned
media was combined with acetonitrile (1:3 volume) and left to shake for
10 min at 4 °C to allow adenosine extraction. Any insoluble material was
pelleted and the supernatant was collected for subsequent LC-MS analysis.
The remaining cells on the dishes were trypsinized, counted and the
adenosine measurements were normalized to cell number.

Statistical tests
Data are presented as mean ± s.e. The statistical signiﬁcance between
treatments was determined by Student’s two-tailed t-test when comparing
two groups and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) when comparing
multiple groups. Po0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. In the
Figures, P-values are denoted as follows—ns, P40.05; *Po 0.05; **Po0.01;
***P o0.001. All data were analysed with GraphPad Prism.
