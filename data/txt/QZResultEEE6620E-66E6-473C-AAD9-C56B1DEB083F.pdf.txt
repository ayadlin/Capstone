ABSTRACT
Many studies involving patients with cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer have shown
that AKT activation leads to inhibition of apoptosis. The aim of this study was to examine
the potential involvement of the Bcl-2 family proteins in AKT-regulated cell survival in
response to cisplatin treatment. Cisplatin-sensitive (PEO1) and cisplatin-resistant (PEO4)
cells were taken from ascites of patients with ovarian cancer before cisplatin treatment
and after development of chemoresistance. It was found that cisplatin treatment activated
the AKT signaling pathway and promoted cell proliferation in cisplatin-resistant EOC cells.
When AKT was transfected into nucleus of cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells, DNAPK was phosphorylated at S473. The activated AKT (pAKT-S473) in these cells inhibited
the death signal induced by cisplatin thereby inhibiting cisplatin-mediated apoptosis.
Results from this study showed that the combination of cisplatin, DNA-PK inhibitor
NU7441, and AKT inhibitor TCN can overcome drug resistance, increase apoptosis, and
re-sensitize PEO4 cells to cisplatin treatment. A decrease in apoptotic activity was seen
in PEO4 cells when Bad was downregulated by siRNA, which indicated that Bad promotes
apoptosis in PEO4 cells. Use of the Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-737 showed that ABT-737 binds to
Bcl-2 but not Mcl-1 and releases Bax/Bak which leads to cell apoptosis. The combination
of ABT-737 and cisplatin leads to a significant increase in the death of PEO1 and PEO4
cells. All together, these results indicate that Bcl-2 family proteins are regulators of drug
resistance. The combination of cisplatin and Bcl-2 family protein inhibitor could be a
strategy for the treatment of cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer.

INTRODUCTION

[2]. Those with tumors that progress during or recur within
6 months of treatment are considered platinum-resistant
[3]. Overall response rates with other treatments in these
platinum-resistant patients are only 10–25% with relatively
short durations of response [2]. Treatment failure is thought
to be attributed to drug resistance in over 90% of cases
with metastatic malignancy [2]. It can arise from multiple
factors such as pharmacokinetic interactions, tumor
micro-environment, and most likely, cancer-cell-specific
abnormalities [2]. Therefore, there is a dire need to better
elucidate the mechanisms behind ovarian cancer drug
resistance and how to overcome them.
While prognosis is initially determined through the
extent of initial surgical resection, chemotherapy is the
cornerstone of maintenance of progression-free survival.

Ovarian cancer is a devastating malignancy, causing
more deaths in the female US population compared to
any other gynecologic cancer [1]. Of the three subgroups
– epithelial, stromal, and germ cell tumors – majority of
ovarian cancer cases are classified as epithelial carcinomas
[1, 2]. Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) at first detection
will already be at advanced stage in approximately 70% of
diagnoses and of these, 30% of women will survive 5 years
[1]. 80% of EOC patients will soon relapse after first-line
chemotherapy [3]. This is in part due to the difficulty in
diagnosis and treatment, particularly the rising concern
of drug resistance. The median progression-free survival
(PFS) is 18 months before most of these patients relapse

Current standard drug treatment includes a combination
regimen of paclitaxel and a platinum compound such as
cisplatin [2]. The mechanism of action of cisplatin is DNA
double-strand damage, which induces phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT activation downstream of DNA-PK
[2, 4]. Hyper-activation of AKT is often seen in cisplatinresistant epithelial ovarian cancers through the inhibition
of p53 phosphorylation [5, 6]. Lee et al. demonstrated
that the addition of an AKT inhibitor enhanced platinuminduced apoptosis in EOC cell lines [7]. Cisplatinmediated cytotoxicity creates a downstream effect on a
variety of molecular factors including activation of p53
and subsequent modulation of Bcl-2 family proteins
including the pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX and
BAK, and anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and
Mcl-1 [2, 8, 9]. Interestingly, AKT inhibition resulted
in downregulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Mcl-1,
suggesting a compensatory mechanism. Thus a more selective
therapy was investigated by van Delft et al. who utilized a
known Bcl-2 inhibitor, ABT-737 in mouse lymphoma cells
[10]. Conversely, Bcl-2 can block p53-mediated apoptosis
and is also a potential predictor of cisplatin-resistance in
EOC [11]. Kassim et al. showed that overexpression of Bcl2 correlated to decreased overall survival in ovarian cancer
patients, therefore concluding the prognostic value of Bcl-2
in aggressive EOC [11]. Therefore, there may be abundant
potential for Bcl-2 as a marker to aid in diagnosis and as an
agent of overcoming cisplatin-resistance.
The aim of this study was to further examine the
role of Bcl-2 family in AKT-regulated cell survival by
evaluating how various known inhibitor compounds
such as NU7441 (a DNA-PK inhibitor), TCN (an AKT
inhibitor), and ABT-737 (a Bcl-2 inhibitor) affect cell
apoptosis in cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant EOC

cells. Modulating this signaling pathway may help reverse
drug resistance and reduce toxicity in these platinumresistant patients, leading to novel EOC treatment methods.

RESULTS
Caspases activity remain constant under various
drug treatments
Caspase 8 and caspase 9 cleavage activation are
crucial for the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways,
respectively [12]. Both caspase 8 and caspase 9 are important
members of the cysteine aspartic acid protease family. Upon
stimulation, the pro-caspase 9 (47 kDa) is associated with
cytochrome c, forming apoptosome complex to process
pro-caspase 9 into an active fragment (35 kDa or 17 kDa)
[12]. Only the cleaved form of caspase 9 can further process
other caspase members, including caspase 3 and caspase 7,
to initiate caspase cascade and cell apoptosis. Caspase 8 was
also activated by cleavage to induce apoptosis. In both PEO1
and PEO4 cells, caspase 8 did not change significantly in
response to various drug treatments, including 10 µM TCN,
10 µM NU7441 and 25 µM cisplatin (Figure 1). Similarly,
expression of full length of caspase 9 was not affected by
drug treatment. However, the active cleaved form of caspase
9 (caspase 9s) was detected in PEO1 cells but not in PEO4
cells, and this was elevated in the presence of cisplatin.
Although these results showed no clear role for caspase-8 or
-9 in apoptosis in the response of PEO1 and PEO4 cells to
cisplatin, they are downstream mediators of apoptosis and
may be activated following treatment for a longer period
(e.g. 24 hrs). Therefore, the expressions of the Bcl-2 family
proteins, which are upstream of these caspases were next
examined (Table 1).

Figure 1: Expressions of caspase 8 and caspase 9 proteins in PEO1 and PEO4 cells in response to treatment with
cisplatin, TCN and NU7441. Cisplatin-sensitive PEO1 cells and cisplatin-resistant PEO4 cells were treated as indicated. Cell lysates
were prepared and were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE agarose gel as described in Materials and Methods. The blots were probed with anticaspase 8/9 antibodies and all blots were re-probed for b-tubulin expression as a loading control.

Expression of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family
proteins are altered differentially in cisplatinsensitive and –resistant EOC cells in response to
treatment with AKT and DNA-PK inhibitors

inhibition in combination with cisplatin therapy stimulates
the Bax/Bak oligomerization directly or indirectly is
still unknown. To investigate the potential role of a
Bax/Bak-mediated mechanism underlying reversal of
cisplatin resistance in response to AKT inhibition, the
expression levels of Bax and Bak were examined using
Western blotting (Table 1) (Figure 2A) and the densities
of the proteins were measured and normalized to their
corresponding beta-tubulin densities (Table 2).
In PEO1 cells Bak expression was found to be
decreased when the cells were treated for 8 hrs with 10 µM
AKT inhibitor TCN, and this decrease was prevented
when the cells were co-treated with 25 µM cisplatin. Bak
expression was also reduced, although to a greater extent,
when cells were treated for 8 hrs with 10 µM DNA-PK
inhibitor NU7441 alone. This was only partially reversed
when cells were treated with 10 µM in combination with

Bcl-2 family proteins are essential molecules
involved in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway and may
be downstream targets for AKT activation, therefore
contributing to the development of cisplatin-resistance.
Identification of such targets could provide clues for drug
discovery in reversing the cisplatin-resistance in EOC.
Following the activation of intrinsic apoptotic
pathway, formation of Bax and Bak oligomers at the outer
mitochondrial membrane increases the permeability of
this membrane, permitting the release of pro-apoptotic
mediators such as cytochrome c [12]. Therefore Bax
and Bak are crucial for this pathway and whether AKT

25 µM cisplatin. In comparison, expression of Bak was
only decreased in PEO4 cells following treatment with
10 µM TCN for 8 hrs. This alluded that TCN-mediated
AKT inhibition could decrease the Bak expression and this
suppression may be reversed by cisplatin-induced DNA
damage. On the other hand, Bax expression was also
decreased by 10 µM NU7441 and 10 µM TCN for 8 hrs,
although the presence of cisplatin suppressed the inhibitory
effect exerted by these two inhibitors. In PEO4 cells,
TCN and NU7441, either alone or in combination with
cisplatin enhanced Bax expression. The upregulation of
Bax may be associated with AKT inhibition and DNA-PK
inhibition, implying that Bax rather than Bak could
become a potential therapeutic strategy.
Inhibition of pro-apoptotic BH-3 only proteins
is also possible to be involved in AKT-promoted cell
survival signaling because of their close association with
other Bcl-2 family members. Thus the expression of proapoptotic BH-3 only proteins in PEO1 and PEO4 cells was
also evaluated. Expression of Bcl-2 interacting killer (Bik)
protein in cisplatin-sensitive PEO1 cell line was found to
be increased following treatment with 25 µM cisplatin
(Figure 2B). This increase occurred to a lesser extent when
the cells were co-treated with TCN, and was prevented
in cells co-treated with NU7441. In comparison, basal
expression of Bik was not detected in cisplatin-resistant
PEO4 cells. However, 25 µM cisplatin treatment in PEO4
cells induced a low Bik expression and TCN or NU7441
treatments prevented this induction completely.
Another pro-apoptotic BH-3 only protein Bid,
exhibited completely different expression patterns in
PEO1 and PEO4 cells. Bid expression was not changed
in PEO1 cells under all conditions but a slight decrease
was seen in PEO4 cells treated with TCN, TCN/cisplatin,
NU7441 and NU7441/cisplatin (Figure 2B). Moreover,
Bid expression was not stimulated by AKT inhibition
directly. From these evidences we assumed that Bid could
be a natural killer in cisplatin-sensitive PEO1 cells but
not in cisplatin-resistant PEO4 cells due to its high
endogenous expression in PEO1 cells only.
Bim has shown distinct expression patterns in PEO1
and PEO4 cells. There are three isoforms of the BH3-only
protein Bim: BimEL (23 kDa), BimL (15 kDa) and BimS
(12 kDa). BimS is the most cytotoxic isoform and is only
transiently expressed during apoptosis [13]. In contrast, the
apoptotic activity of the longer isoforms may be inhibited
by phosphorylation and normally the BimEL and BimL
are sequestered dynein motor complex and only released
during apoptosis [13]. In PEO1 cells, three bands were
observed: the top band representing the full length of Bim
(BimEL 23 kDa) while the other two bands indicated the
two additional isoforms of Bim (BimL: 15 kDa and BimS:
12 kDa) (Figure 2B). In PEO4 cells, expression of BimEL
was found to be increased after co-treatment with 10 µM
TCN and 25 µM cisplatin. In addition, a slight increase
in expression of BimL was detected in cells treated with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

10 µM TCN and 10 µM NU7441, both alone and in
combination with cisplatin. More importantly, the changes
of the short forms of Bim between PEO1 and PEO4 cells
were striking. The evidence presented here may suggest
that Bim in PEO1 is poised for apoptosis whereas that in
PEO4 is not to the same extent.
Puma, a pro-apoptotic BH-3 only Bcl-2 family
protein identified recently, was also screened in this
study [15]. Puma was increased in PEO1 cells treated
with 10 µM TCN or 10 µM NU7441 in combination with
25 µM cisplatin at the same time (Figure 2B). In contrast,
TCN and NU7441 treatments repressed Puma expression
in PEO4 cells in the absence of cisplatin but this inhibitory
effect was abrogated when these compounds were
combined with cisplatin treatment. AKT inhibition, as a
result, may interfere with puma expression in cisplatinsensitive PEO1 cells but not in its cisplatin-resistant
counterpart PEO4 cells.

Bad is involved in the responses of EOC cells to
cisplatin
The active form of AKT phosphorylates Bad at
Ser136 residue, directly inhibiting cell apoptosis and
decreasing the chemo-sensitivity to cisplatin in EOC cells
[16]. Therefore Bad protein expression and pBad (Ser136)
expression levels before and after AKT inhibition in the
presence or absence of cisplatin were of particular interest
and were investigated to determine the correlation between
Bad activation (i.e. phosphorylation) and AKT inhibition. In
cisplatin-sensitive PEO1 cells, treatment with 10 µM TCN
exerted a significant inhibitory effect on Bad expression and
co-treatment with 25 µM cisplatin restored the expression
to the basal level, which was observed in the untreated
PEO1 cells (Figure 2C). Moreover, treatment with 10 µM
NU7441 mediated a slightly greater inhibitory effect on Bad
expression, compared with TCN alone, but the combination
of cisplatin and NU7441 did not restore Bad expression.
On the other hand, pBad (Ser136) expression was greatly
increased in PEO1 cells in response to treatment with 25
µM cisplatin. This was not prevented in cells co-treated
with 10 µM TCN or 10 µM NU7441, although treatment
with these agents alone decreased expression of pBad
(Ser136) in these cells. This indicated that Bad inactivation
by AKT was not influenced by AKT signaling directly.
In other words, the AKT inhibition resulted from direct
inhibition by TCN or indirect inhibition by NU7441 did
not interfere with the Bad inactivation in cisplatin-sensitive
PEO1 cells (Figure 2C).
In contrast, Bad expression was increased 3-fold
in PEO4 cells treated with 25 µM cisplatin (Figure 2C).
Moreover, 10 µM TCN and 10 µM NU7441 treatments
also enhanced Bad expression by 4.8- and 6-fold,
respectively. Cisplatin used in the presence of TCN
enhanced the Bad expression further, with a 5.5-fold
increase compare with basal levels measured. In
comparison, Bad protein in PEO4 cells treated with the

combination of NU7441 and cisplatin presented a similar
increase in expression compared with those treated
with NU7441 alone (fold-increases of 6.16 and 6.26,
respectively) (Figure 2C). Expression of pBad (Ser136)
was slightly increased in PEO4 cells treated with 25 µM
cisplatin. However, a 3-fold increase in expression was
detected in these cells following treatment with 10 µM
NU7441, and this up-regulation increased to 4.5-fold when
NU7441 was combined with cisplatin. pBad (Ser136)/

Bad ratios in PEO4 cells were obtained by dividing the
densitometry values of pBad (S136) to the corresponding
densitometry values of total Bad (Figure 2D). It is obvious
that pBad was rarely presented in PEO4 cells and cisplatin
did not affect the phosphorylation of Bad due to the similar
values of pBad/Bad was obtained in presence of cisplatin
(0.43) in comparison to that in cells incubated with DMSO
control (0.49). In comparison, pBad/Bad ratios obtained
from PEO4 cells when they were treated with individual

TCN or TCN in combination with cisplatin were relatively
low (0.03 and 0.11, respectively), indicating that AKT
mediated the inhibitory Bad phosphorylation at Ser136
(Figure 2D). Nevertheless, individual use of NU7441 or its
combination with cisplatin in PEO4 cells increased pBad
levels significantly and the pBad/Bad values were 0.54 and
0.72 under these two conditions. This implies that the DNAPK inhibition does not fully mimic AKT inhibition in terms
of the modulation of pro-apoptotic proteins (Figure 2E).
The increased expression of total Bad in response
to TCN and NU7441 clearly suggests that this could be
an important mechanism by which AKT inhibition resensitizes cisplatin-resistant PEO4 cells to cisplatin. To
investigate this further, Bad siRNA knockdown transfection
in PEO4 cells was carried out in the rest of study.

cells and cisplatin did not affect Bcl-2 levels. The changes
of Bcl-2 expression were relatively modest except for a
decrease in cells treated with combination of NU7441 and
cisplatin (Figure 3).
On the other hand, in cisplatin-resistant PEO4 cells,
Bcl-2 protein expression was not affected by cisplatin
treatment but was completely abrogated by NU7441
treatments. Moreover, this decrease in Bcl-2 protein
expression was maintained in cells treated with NU7441
and cisplatin at the same time. TCN inhibitor alone did
not affect Bcl-2 protein expression, whereas TCN used
in the presence of cisplatin suppressed Bcl-2 protein
expression extensively (Figure 3). This provides evidence
that AKT inhibition by NU7441 and TCN had a significant
inhibitory impact on anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression,
especially in combination with cisplatin therapy. Thus
TCN/NU7441 could become good suppressive agents
targeting Bcl-2 protein.
The phosphorylation status of Bcl-2 was also
investigated using anti-pBcl2 (Ser70) and anti-pBcl
(Thr56) antibodies. pBcl-2 (Thr56) was not detected
in either PEO1 or PEO4 cells whereas pBcl-2 (Ser70)
was found in PEO1 cells only but not in PEO4 cells.
pBcl-2 (Ser70) was only observed in control cells (no
treatment and DMSO treated) and was reduced in all other
treatments and in particular by NU7441 treatment where
it was barely detectable. Cisplatin appeared to have some
modest restorative effect on Bcl-2 levels in combination
with either TCN or NU7441 (Figure 3).
Mcl-1 is another anti-apoptotic protein within the
Bcl-2 family proteins and localizes to the mitochondria,

Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein is an important
modulator of chemosensitivity in EOC cells
Bcl-2 was the first identified anti-apoptotic protein
and is known to inhibit apoptosis by sequestering its proapoptotic partners. Bcl-2 is frequently phosphorylated via
several sites, including Thr56, Ser70, Thr74 and Ser87.
Ser70 phosphorylation is the most frequently observed,
suggesting its functional significance and phosphorylation
of Bcl-2 is assumed to abrogate the pro-survival activity
of Bcl-2 (reviewed in [17]). Therefore the expression of
total Bcl-2 and pBcl-2 were tested here to examine the
potential involvement of Bcl-2 in AKT-promoted cell
survival signaling. As shown in Figure 3, total Bcl-2
expression exhibited a relative low basal level in PEO1

interacting with and antagonizing pro-apoptotic Bcl-2
family members [18]. Mcl-1 can be activated at both
transcriptional and post-transcriptional level, which
is distinct from other family members that tend to be
activated at protein level [18]. Mcl-1 is rapidly transcribed
via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, leading to the
increased expression during myeloid differentiation and

cytokine stimulation [18]. Mcl-1 expression level in
PEO1 cells did not exhibit significant differences among
various drug treatments (Figure 3). In PEO4 cells, Mcl-1
expression was decreased following treatment with
cisplatin and TCN. However, when a combination of
TCN with cisplatin was used, Mcl-1 expression increased
greatly (Figure 3). NU7441 alone increased Mcl-1

expression in PEO4 cells, although combination with
cisplatin modestly reduced this effect. Considering the
expression variances of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 in PEO4 cells,
it is possible that the increased Mcl-1 expression was
induced by the loss of Bcl-2 expression in response to
AKT inhibition, utilizing as a potential compensatory
mechanism. Therefore, a specific inhibitor for Bcl-2,
Bcl-XL and Bcl-w, termed BH-3 mimetic ABT-737
inhibitor, could be used in PEO1 and PEO4 cells to evaluate
the correlation between Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 in determining the
chemosensitivity.
Bcl-XL is also a member of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2
family proteins and it prevents apoptosis via two distinct
mechanisms, heterodimerization with pro-apoptotic
proteins and formation of mitochondrial outer membrane
pores to help maintain a normal membrane state under
stressful conditions [19]. Bcl-XL expression in PEO1
cells did not vary under different drug treatments with
the exception of NU7441 (Figure 3). NU7441 treatment
reduced Bcl-XL expression both in the presence or
absence of cisplatin. However, NU7441 did not have a
similar impact on Bcl-XL expression in PEO4 cells and
Bcl-XL expression was only suppressed to some extent
by TCN and its combination with cisplatin (Figure 3). The
divergent effects on Bcl-XL expression exerted by TCNand NU7441-mediated AKT inhibition suggested that
inhibition of Bcl-XL expression may not be involved in
DNA-damage mediated AKT signaling pathway.
In addition to anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins,
XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein) may be a
key determinant in chemosensitivity by suppressing the
apoptotic activities induced by cisplatin in ovarian cancer
[20]. XIAP is suggested as a activator in PI3K/AKT
survival pathway in chemo-sensitive and chemo-resistant
ovarian cancer cell lines [20]. Here we investigated the
XIAP expression levels under specified conditions and
there are negligible differences on XIAP expression across
the various conditions. However, XIAP expression level
was clearly reduced upon cisplatin treatment in PEO1
cells but not in PEO4 cells (Figure 3). XIAP expression
was also reduced by TCN and NU7441 in both PEO1 and
PEO4 cells, indicating a potential correlation between
XIAP expression and AKT activation regardless of the
extent of chemo-sensitivity of the cells. However, the
repression of XIAP protein was restored by cisplatin
treatments in PEO1 and PEO4 cells (Figure 3). In all,
XIAP demonstrated similar expression patterns in PEO1
and PEO4 cells in response to individual use of TCN and
NU7441 as well as their combinations with cisplatin.

activity in PEO4 cells was examined by Bad siRNA
transfection, caspase 3/7 and MTT assays. Firstly, the
working concentration of Bad siRNA was optimized to
achieve the best transfection efficiency with minimal
cytotoxicity. Western blotting analysis was then carried out
to assess efficiency of Bad siRNA knockdown, showing
that 50  nM Bad siRNA knocked down Bad expression
by 50% in comparison to 50 nM siGenome Lamin A/C
control (Figure 4A). Furthermore, Bad siRNA at 100 nM
inhibited Bad protein expression by 90% and thus Bad
siRNA (100 nM) was adopted for the further experiments
(Figure 4A).
To investigate the apoptotic activity after
transfection, the Bad siRNA-transfected PEO4 cells
were seeded in 96 well plates for caspase 3/7 and
MTT assays. As is widely known, caspase3/7 assay
provides a proluminescent caspase 3/7 substrate,
releasing aminoluciferin by cleavage [21]. The cleaved
aminoluciferin can be consumed by the luciferase,
producing a luminescent signal which is proportional to
the caspase 3/7 activity [21]. As shown in Figure 4B, the
induction of apoptosis on cisplatin treatment (1.4-fold
increase: 1.718/1.226) was reduced in Bad siRNAtransfected PEO4 cells when compared to that in untreated
PEO4 cells (2.055-fold increase) and siGenome Lamintransfected control cells (2.31-fold increase) (Figure 4B).
Although this indicates that Bad is functionally proapoptotic in response to cisplatin in cisplatin-resistant
PEO4 cells, the incomplete inhibition of apoptosis
suggests that Bad was not solely responsible for the
apoptotic responses in PEO4 cells.

ABT-737 sensitized PEO1 and PEO4 cells to
cisplatin treatment
BH-3 mimetic ABT-737 is a small molecule
inhibitor that could trigger Bax/Bak-mediated apoptosis
and it has a high affinity for Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Bcl-w
but not Mcl-1 [22]. Moreover, the inability of ABT-737
to target Mcl-1 and the enhancement of Mcl-1 expression
conferred resistance in cancer cells [22]. Here we investigate
the potential of ABT-737 in reversing the resistance by
targeting the Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL in ovarian cancer cell lines
via caspase3/7 and MTT assays. Here ABT-737 (1 mM) was
found to sensitize the PEO1 and PEO cells to cisplatin to a
large extent (1.85 fold increases in PEO1 cells and 3.93 fold
increases in PEO4 cells) (Figure 5). Importantly, ABT-737
alone was relatively non-apoptotic towards both cell lines
(1.697 and 0.874 in PEO1 and PEO4, respectively, implying
that ABT-737 did not confer much toxicity to these two cell
lines and without an apoptotic stimulus (e.g. cisplatin) the
cells would not induce apoptosis even when anti-apoptotic
proteins are inhibited (Figure 5). These results suggest
that ABT-737 could be a promising therapeutic agent for
reversing the cisplatin-resistance in ovarian cancer and can
be used in combination with cisplatin in advanced EOC.

Although Mcl-1 expression was increased in response
to TCN/NU7441-based treatments in PEO4 cells, this
elevation was not sufficient to overcome the inhibition
of Bcl-2 protein under the same conditions (Figure 3). In
this case, the combination therapy of ABT-737 and AKT
inhibitors like TCN and NU7441 is of profound importance
to be investigated furthermore due to the expression

for 90% of the cases [2]. Cisplatin is the first line
chemotherapeutic agent for patients with ovarian cancers
[3]. However, despite initial sensitivity to platinum-based
chemotherapy, EOC often develop drug-resistance, which
limits patient survival [3]. AKT survival signaling, which
is a crucial regulator of cell proliferation, growth, survival
and metabolism, had been implicated in the development
of drug-resistance and the progression of EOC [5, 6].
There are emerging evidences for the involvement of
AKT in controlling the apoptosis mechanism in response
to cisplatin-induced DNA damage, promoting the cell
survival and acquiring eventual cisplatin-resistance in
EOC [5, 6]. DNA-PK was found to phosphorylate AKT

of total Bad were assessed by Western Blotting as described in Materials and Methods. 90% knockdown of Bad was achieved when PEO4
cells were transfected with Bad siRNA (100 nM). The apoptotic activity induced by cisplatin was significantly reduced by Bad siRNA
when compared to that in untreated cells. (B) Bad siRNA knockdown repressed the apoptotic activity of cisplatin in chemo-resistant
PEO4 cells. The caspase3/7 assay and MTT assay were performed to observe the influence of Bad knockdown on apoptosis in response to

apoptotic response of PEO4 cells to cisplatin.

at Ser473 directly in response to platinum, promoting
resistance. The phosphorylated AKT exerts its biological
functions via phosphorylation of its downstream
targets, ultimately inhibiting apoptosis and promoting
cell survival [5, 6]. Many studies had found that AKT
activation is frequently observed in patients with relapse
and therefore the potential role of AKT in the acquired
cisplatin resistance may have significant clinical
relevance [4–7]. Furthermore, Bcl-2 family proteins are
key modulators of the intrinsic mitochondrial-mediated
apoptotic pathway and regulation of the activity of some
members within this family have been associated with
AKT phosphorylation and chemosensitivity in EOC
[2, 8, 9]. The mechanisms in which Bcl-2 family proteins
interact to bring about the cisplatin-resistant phenotype
of DNA-PK mediated AKT activation remains to be fully
elucidated. This study therefore aims to examine the
potential involvement of Bcl-2 proteins in AKT-regulated
cell survival in response to cisplatin in cisplatin-sensitive
and cisplatin-resistant EOC cells. Here we provide some
preliminary data on the differential expression of Bcl-2
family protein according to AKT activity and give
some insights into the possible mechanisms of AKT in
developing cisplatin resistance.
To investigate the association of AKT inhibition
and subsequent resensitisation to cisplatin with Bcl-2
family members, Western blotting was used to identify
the potential downstream targets of TCN and NU7441
within this family in cisplatin-sensitive (PEO1) and its
cisplatin-resistant counterpart (PEO4) cell lines. TCN is a
selective potent AKT inhibitor and is found to inhibit AKT
activation directly with high affinity. Although there is
limited literature regarding the effect of NU7441 on AKT
inhibition, the fact that DNA-PK can phosphorylate AKT
at Ser473 in presence of cisplatin can be used to suggest
that NU7441 can function as an indirect AKT inhibitor
[19]). After Western blotting screening of the Bcl-2 family
proteins and several other potential apoptotic proteins, we
identified interesting targets and selected Bad and Bcl-2
for further assessments.
Firstly, multi-domain pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak
are executors of apoptosis and their oligomerizations
on the outer mitochondrial membrane are required for
the release of cytochrome c and induction of apoptosis
[18]. Previous studies have suggested that Bax rather
than Bak promotes apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells and
the data shown here also support this. Bak expression
is not affected by AKT inhibition whereas an elevated
level of Bax expression was detected in response to AKT
inhibition in cisplatin-resistant PEO4 cells. This suggests
the potential involvement of Bax in re-sensitizing PEO4
cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis in response to AKT
inhibition. However, this evidence is not sufficient to show
that Bax is a direct downstream target for AKT activation
and therefore Bax was not taken forward for further
study in this project. Moreover, the limitation of Western
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Blotting is its inability to tell whether the protein is active
in forming the pores on the mitochondrial membrane.
Thus Bak expression may not be altered but it could still
be functionally modulated upon treatments.
Another pro-apoptotic subgroup of Bcl-2 family is
the BH-3 only proteins, of which Bik, Bid, Bim, puma and
Bad were assessed here using Western blotting. There are
two models by which Bax may be activated by BH-3 only
proteins, including direct activation and neutralization of
the anti-apoptotic proteins [18]. Here BimEL expression
was found to be up-regulated by the AKT inhibitor TCN
in the presence of cisplatin in cisplatin-resistant PEO4
cells. This strongly supports a direct link between Bim
expression and AKT phosphorylation in EOC cells.
Moreover, expression of the more pro-apoptotic BimL
was induced in PEO4 cells in response to AKT inhibition.
Together, these results suggest that in addition to Bax,
Bim is involved in the re-sensitization of chemoresistant
EOC cells to cisplatin by AKT inhibitors. The data
obtained from cisplatin-sensitive cells shown that the
most pro-apoptotic isoform of Bim (Bims) was abundantly
expressed especially in cells treated with cisplatin and
TCN inhibitor. In the meantime, the BimEL level was
significantly diminished by cisplatin. All these evidences
indicate that Bim especially Bims plays a stimulatory role
in apoptosis in response to cisplatin. (Figure 6).
The BH-3 only Bad protein, which is a known
downstream substrate of the AKT phosphorylation, has
also been implicated in determining the chemosensitivity
in EOC [16]. The phosphorylation of Bad at Ser136
inactivates its pro-apoptotic activity and therefore we
studied the expression variances of Bad protein and its
phosphorylation at Ser136 in response to AKT inhibition
and platinum treatment. Here in cisplatin-resistant PEO4
cells, Bad protein was found to be increased in response to
AKT inhibition. Moreover, TCN-targeted AKT suppression
prevented Bad phosphorylation at Ser136, which was seen
in PEO4 cells treated with cisplatin. Together, these results
suggest that inactivation of Bad may be an underlying
cause of cisplatin resistance in PEO4 cells, and that AKT
inhibition desensitizes these cells by both upregulation
of Bad and reversal of its inactivation. Interestingly, Bad
phosphorylation was found to be increased in PEO4 cells
treated with NU7441, either alone or in combination with
cisplatin. This suggests that inactivation of AKT activity
via DNA-PK may activate an alternative re-sensitization
mechanism, compared with direct inhibition of AKT. In
cisplatin-sensitive PEO1 cells, Bad expression was not
affected by AKT inhibition. However, cisplatin-induced
Bad inactivation via phosphorylation was not prevented
in cells co-treated with TCN or NU7441. This may
partly explain why AKT inhibition does not increase the
sensitivity of PEO1 cells to cisplatin. However, AKT
inhibition alone decreased Bad phosphorylation in PEO1
cells. Together, this suggests that Bad does not have an
important role in the apoptotic response of chemosensitive

PEO1 cells to cisplatin. Given the potential importance
of bad in regulating cisplatin-sensitivity in PEO4 cells,
inhibition of Bad expression by siRNA knockdown was
found to partially prevent cisplatin-induced apoptosis
in transfected PEO4 cells. The incomplete repression
of apoptosis implies that Bad alone is not sufficient for
cisplatin-induced apoptosis in these cells, and that other
protein are also involved in the induction of apoptosis.
However, this suppression may also have arisen due to the
cytotoxicity of the transfection reagents to the cells during
the experiments. Although cells remained viable after 72 hr
transfection as seen in the initial MTT assay, additional
stresses of harvesting and reseeding may have accumulated
and these stresses may cause widespread cell death at the
72 hr post-transfection time point. Thus the knockdown
of Bad may not be involved in, or sufficient to prevent
cell death in such instance. In addition, the use of a high
amount of Bad siRNA (100 nM) may have contributed to
cytotoxicity. However, this amount was chosen,although
50 nM Bad siRNA may have a lower cytotoxicity, the
transfection efficiency was too low (50%) to demonstrate
the influence of Bad siRNA knockdown on cell viability.
This functionally highlights the potential pro-apoptotic
role of Bad in cisplatin-resistant cells.
In comparison to Bim and Bad, expression of
pro-apoptotic BH-3 only proteins Bik and Bid were not
found to be regulated by AKT in the present study. Bik is
rarely associated with AKT activation in literature but its
expression has been shown to be necessary for caspase-8
activation. Bik expression was not affected by TCN- or
NU7441-mediated AKT inhibition, however, its expression
level was elevated in response to cisplatin treatment in
both cisplatin-sensitive (PEO1) and cisplatin-resistant

(PEO4) cells. Thus it is possible that Bik is involved in
the apoptotic pathway directly activated by cisplatin
in ovarian cancer cells but its activity is not induced by
AKT signaling pathway. The lack of effect of cisplatin,
TCN and NU7441 on Bid expression in PEO1 and PEO4
cells suggests that this protein is not involved in apoptotic
pathways activated in these cells, and also that AKT does
not regulate the activity of this protein. Unlike Bik and Bid,
the expression of the pro-apoptotic BH-3 only protein may
be regulated by AKT in PEO1 and PEO4 cells. However,
the effect of AKT inhibition on Puma expression was found
to be different in the cell lines, and was increased in PEO1
cells but decreased in PEO4 cells. Puma is a p53 inducible
gene and acts as pro-apoptotic factor by binding to antiapoptotic Bcl-2 [15]. A recent study has established that
induction of Puma expression by cisplatin was abolished
in p53-deficient SKOV3 cells whereas increased Puma
expression would sensitize SKOV3 cells to cisplatin via
down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 [15].
Moreover, the Puma-triggered Mcl-1 down-regulation can
be associated with caspase-dependent cleavage. Therefore
overexpression of Puma could potentially enhance the
sensitivity to cisplatin in EOC by lowering the threshold
set simultaneously by Bcl-XL and Mcl-1. Thus, as both
PEO1 and PEO4 cells are p53 mutated the lack of effect
of cisplatin on Puma expression may due to this. However,
the mechanism by which AKT inhibition regulates Puma
expression may be p53-independent, and remains to
be investigated. From these aspects, the role of Puma
in cisplatin-induced apoptosis and in determining the
chemosensitivity remains complex and unclear.
Bcl-2 is an intriguing member within the Bcl-2 family
that may be identified as a downstream target of AKT

and AKT inhibitor TCN.

phosphorylation. In this study Western blot data suggested
an association between AKT inhibition and suppression of
anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression in both PEO1 and
PEO4 cells. Bcl-2 expression was decreased by NU7441
regardless of the presence or absence of cisplatin. In
addition, TCN also exerted a complete inhibitory effect
on Bcl-2 expression in PEO4 cells when it was used in
combination with cisplatin. Interestingly, phosphorylation
of Bcl-2 at Ser70 (pBcl-2) was completely abrogated in
PEO1 cells in response to cisplatin and AKT inhibition. And
the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 at Ser70 was not detected in
PEO4 cells, implying a potential regulatory role of Bcl-2 in
cisplatin-sensitivity via its phosphorylation. Several studies
speculated that pBcl-2 (Ser70) status is closely correlated
with metastasis and the extent of malignancy in colorectal
cancer and the absence of pBcl-2 (Ser70) is closely
associated with poor survival in colorectal cancer [17]. Loss
of pBcl-2 (Ser70) was more frequently recognized in the
cases with advanced stage of lymph nodal metastasis and
clinical stages in comparison to the poorly differentiated
cases [17]. Considering this particularly with our evidences,
it is convincible to assume that phosphorylation of pBcl-2
at Ser70 could play a similar inhibitory role in the inhibition
of apoptosis in EOC. Therefore pBcl-2 (Ser70) can be
suggested as biological marker for the extent of cisplatinsensitivity in EOC and a novel prognostic indicator. It is
also necessary to mention that pBcl-2 (Thr56) was not
detected in this study and therefore we assume that no clear
association of phosphorylation of Bcl-2 at Thr56 found
according to present study.
In comparison, Bcl-XL expression was decreased
in response to TCN in PEO1 cells only, and to NU7441
in PEO4 cells only. Together, these results indicate a
greater role for Bcl-2 in the AKT-mediated regulation
of cell survival pathways. Furthermore, the Western blot
analysis on Mcl-1 expression can be interpreted alongside
with the protein profiling results of Bcl-2. Intriguingly,
inhibition of AKT increased Mcl-1 expression in PEO4
cells. This suggests that although AKT inhibition can
inhibit expression of anti-apoptotic bcl-2, the cells may
attempt to counteract this by increasing Mcl-1 expression
as a possible cellular compensatory mechanism (Figure 6).
Thus it is possible that cisplatin resistance in these cells
requires suppression of more than one anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family proteins. To further clarify the role of Bcl-2 and
Mcl-1 in cisplatin-induced apoptosis, a BH-3 mimetic
ABT-737, which has a high affinity for Bcl-2 and BclXL but not Mcl-1, was used in both cisplatin-sensitive
and cisplatin-resistant cell lines (Figure 6). Previous
studies shown that ABT-737 triggered Bax/Bak-mediated
apoptosis by targeting Bcl-2/Bcl-XL but ABT-737’s
inability to target Mcl-1 may confer resistance to cisplatin
in vitro [22]. Here ABT-737 inhibitor was found to
sensitize both PEO1 and PEO4 cells to cisplatin treatment,
confirming that Bcl-2 has an important role in determining
the cisplatin-sensitivity in EOC. Accordingly, ABT-737 in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

combination with cisplatin may be an effective strategy
for enhancing the response of patients to cisplatin therapy.
In addition to the Bcl-2 family of proteins, the role
of the apoptotic effectors caspase 8 and caspase 9 in the
response of EOC cells to cisplatin and AKT inhibition was
also assessed (Figure 6). Here the cleaved form of caspase
9 was only detected in PEO1 cells in response to cisplatin
treatment. However, it is possible that the proteolytic
activation of caspase 9, which occurs downstream of Bcl2 proteins may only be detectable after treatment periods
of greater than the 8 hrs time point which was used in
this study. Similarly, no cleaved forms of caspase 8 were
detected, but assessment of their expression after longer
treatment times will be required to determine whether or
not it is involved in the response of the cells to the drugs.
However in support of a role for caspase 9 in cisplatininduced apoptosis in PEO1 cells expression of X-linked
inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), which prevents activation of
caspase 9, was found to be decrease in cisplatin-sensitive
PEO1 cells treated with cisplatin. Apparently, more
assessment is needed to give more information on XIAP
molecular actions during apoptosis. Together with the data
regarding Bcl-2 protein expression, these results suggest
the intrinsic apoptotic pathway is the main mechanism by
which apoptosis is induced in cisplatin-sensitive PEO1
cells treated with cisplatin (Figure 6).
Taken together, our results suggest that Bcl-2 family
proteins are regulators of drug resistance. This study
provides rational to support using a combination of cisplatin
and ABT-737 to treat cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials and chemicals
AKT inhibitor TCN, DNA-PK inhibitor NU7441,
and Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-737, were obtained from Berry
and Associates (Devon, UK), KuDOS Pharmaceuticals
(Cambridge, UK) and Allan Richardson (London, UK),
respectively. They were dissolved in DMSO. Cisplatin
(1 mg/ml in PBS) was obtained from the Pharmacy
Department, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK. All
other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(Dorest UK), and all solutions were prepared and diluted
using distilled water.

Cell culture
PEO1, PEA1 and PEO14 are platinum-sensitive
cell lines while their intra-patient paired variants, PEO4,
PEA2 and PEO23, are platinum-resistant. They were
all generated from ascites fluid taken from patients with
ovarian cancer before cisplatin treatment (PEO1, PEA1,
PEO14) and after development of chemoresistance (PEO4,
PEA2, PEO23) [23]. These cell lines were maintained
in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,

representing 95% knockdown of OPCML and 1×OPCML,
respectively. These two cell lines were maintained in
RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS,
2 mM L-Glutamine and 3 µg/ml Puromycin (Invitrogen,
(California ,USA) at 33°C with 5% CO2.

25 µg protein was added to an equal volume of 2×
loading buffer [0.5M Tris-HCl (pH6.8), 20% Glycerol,
10% SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.1% Bromophenol
Blue] and boiled for 5 minutes at 90°C. The denatured
proteins were resolved by 8% or 12% sodium dodecyl
sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
using a Mini-Protean electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad,
Berkeley, CA, USA). The separated proteins were then
transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad,
Berkeley, CA, USA) at 100 volts for 1 hr using a MiniTransBlot system (Bio-Rad, Berkeley, CA, USA). The
membranes were then blocked with 5% skimmed milk
in tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Trition-X
(TBS-T)or 5% BSA in TBS-T for detection of phosphoproteins, for 1 hour at room temperature with shaking.
The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies
(Table 1) at 4°C overnight with shaking. The blots were
then washed three times for 5 mins each, with TBS-T prior
to incubation with appropriate horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (Table 1) for 1 hr
at room temperature with shaking. The blots were washed
as before and proteins were visualized using Millipore™
Immobilon™ Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate
system (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) as
per manufacturer’s instructions. The blots were developed
on photography film using Kodax SRX SRX2200
(Rochester, NY, USA).

Drug treatments
When required for drug treatment, cells were
harvested by trypsinisation and cell counting was carried
out using a hemacytometer. The trypsinized cells were
centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 mins and resuspended by
pipetting up and down thoroughly. Then the cells were
counted using a hemacytometer (Thermo Scientific, USA)
following manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were seeded
at the required density and allowed to adhere overnight.
When required for detected of phospho-proteins, cells
were serum starved overnight by incubating in serum-free
medium. Culture medium was then removed, and replaced
with the required concentrations of drugs, or vehicle
control. Treated cells were incubated under the appropriate
conditions and the required time period.

siRNA transfection
The transfection with Bad small interfering
RNA (siRNA) (5′→3′ sense: GGAGGAUGAGUGACG
AGUUtt; 5′→3′ anti-sense: AACUCGUCACUCAUCCUC
Cgg) (Applied Biosystems/Ambion, USA) was performed
using antibiotic-free RPMI media containing 10% FCS and
2 mM L-Glutamine. PEO4 cells were seeded at 1 × 106
cells/well in 6-well plate and left in incubator overnight.
Cells were transfected by the addition of Optimem medium
(400 µl, Invitrogen) containing 100  nM Bad siRNA or
siGenome Lamin A/C control siRNA (Dharmacon, Denver,
Colorado, US) in the presence of 0.1% Transfection
Reagent-1 (Dhramacon). After 48 hrs, a second transfection
was carried out and the cells were incubated for a further
24 hrs. Transfected cells were then washed with PBS and
trypsinized using 1 × Trypsine as previously described
(Section 4.3). Cells were then counted and seeded in 6-well
plate and 96-well plates for Western Blotting analysis,
MTT and Caspase 3/7 Assays, respectively.

SDS-PAGE and Western blotting
Following drug treatment, cells were washed once
with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed
using 30 µl Radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) buffer
[50 mM 1×TBS, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Sodium
Deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.004% Sodium Azide, PMSF,
Sodium orthovanadate and 10 µl/ml 100× phosphatase

X-100 and 10 µl/ml 100× phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Texas, USA)]. Then the cells
were left on ice for 15 mins and harvested with a cell
scraper. The lysate was then centrifuged at 13,300 rpm
for 10 mins at 4°C and the supernatant was collected.
The protein concentration of each sample was examined
by Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) protein assay (Thermo
Scientific, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Caspase 3/7 assay
The cells were seeded at 20,000 cells/well in a white
opaque 96-well plate (PerkinElmer, Singapore) and the
plate was left in incubator overnight. Cells were treated
with 25 µM cisplatin or vehicle for 24 hrs. CaspaseGloâ 3/7 Substrate (Promega, USA) was added as per
manufacturer’s instructions and the plate was incubated at
room temperature for 1 hr. Luminescence was measured
using a LUMIstar model luminometer (BMG LabTech)
using OPTIMA software (BMG LabTech).

Data analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out using Microsoft
Excel 2001 and data are presented as mean ± standard
error of the mean (SEM) combining three experimental
repeats. The Western blot results were analyzed using
densitometry (Image J software) where appropriate and
the values of the protein densities were normalized to their
corresponding beta-tubulin loading control to compare the
variances of protein expression under specified conditions.
