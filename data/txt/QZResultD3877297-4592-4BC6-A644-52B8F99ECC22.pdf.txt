ABSTRACT
YM155, a small molecule inhibitor of the antiapoptotic protein survivin, has been
developed as a potential anti-cancer drug. We investigated a combination therapy
of YM155 and interleukin-2 (IL-2) in a mouse model of renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
YM155 caused cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in renal cancer (RENCA) cells. Next,
luciferase-expressing RENCA cells were implanted in the left kidney and the lung of
BALB/c mice to develop RCC metastatic model. In this orthotopic renal and metastatic
lung tumors models, YM155 and IL-2 additively decreased tumor weight, lung
metastasis, and luciferin-stained tumor images. Also, the combination significantly
suppressed regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells compared with
single agent treatment. We suggest that a combination of YM155 and IL-2 can be
tested as a potential therapeutic modality in patients with RCC.

INTRODUCTION

long-term complete remission in metastatic RCC, as
with IL-2 treatment, which offers the only potentially
curative treatment in patients with advanced disease [10,
11]. However, the complete, durable response rates of
immunotherapy have been shown to be less than 10% in
select patients receiving intensive care [12, 13]. Due to its
limited use and efficacy, an effective treatment strategy
that includes IL-2 immunotherapy combined with other
methods is required to improve the efficacy of IL-2
immunotherapy.
Survivin, encoded by the BIRC5 gene, inhibits
apoptosis and regulates mitosis [14, 15]. Survivin is
undetectable or expressed at extremely low levels in
normal tissue, whereas it is upregulated in many malignant
tumors and plays a critical role in cancer progression
and treatment resistance [16]. Survivin expression has

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common
malignant tumor of the kidney [1, 2]. Approximately 30%
of patients with RCC have metastasis when diagnosed
[3], and one-third develop recurrence or metastasis after
initial treatment [4]. High-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2)
therapy was approved in 1992 by the US Food and Drug
Administration for treatment of metastatic RCC [5].
Recently, the development of therapies that target vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and mammalian target
of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways, including sorafenib
[6], sunitinib [7], temsirolimus [8], and everolimus
[9] have exhibited angiogenesis-inhibitory effects.
Nevertheless, the development of resistance to targeted
drugs has resulted in disease progression without durable

been shown to be an independent prognostic marker of
pathologic characteristics and clinical outcomes in RCC
[17, 18]. These characteristics make survivin a potential
therapeutic target. YM155, a novel selective small
molecule survivin inhibitor, has demonstrated antitumor
activities in a wide variety of mouse models of tumor
xenografts [19,20] and has demonstrated synergistic
antitumor activities in lung cancer, breast cancer, and
leukemia when combined with other antitumor agents
[21-23].
In this work, we evaluated the antitumor
activities of YM155 alone and in combination with
IL-2 in a mouse model of RCC. We found that YM155
treatment downregulated survivin expression in renal
cancer (RENCA) cells, inhibited renal carcinoma
cell proliferation, and induced cell apoptosis in vitro.
Furthermore, the combination of YM155 and IL-2
demonstrated an additive antitumor effect on both
orthotopic renal and metastatic lung tumors in a RENCA

mouse model of RCC and induced the additional
downregulation of peripheral myeloid-derived suppressor
cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in vivo.

RESULTS
Survivin was highly expressed in RENCA cells
We measured survivin levels in several human and
mouse renal cell lines by Western blot analysis; the highest
levels were demonstrated in RENCA cells, followed by
KPK-1, CAKI-1, and ACHN (Figure 1A). Survivin levels
in normal cell line RPTEC were extremely low.

Potent additive antitumor effects of the
combination of YM155 and IL-2 on both
orthotopic and metastatic lung tumors in a
RENCA mouse model of RCC

The antiproliferative activity of YM155 against
the renal carcinoma cell lines RENCA, KPK-1, CAKI1, and ACHN was examined. As shown in Figure 1B,
YM155 inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent
manner. These renal carcinoma cell lines were sensitive
to YM155 treatment with 50% inhibition concentrations
of approximately 3–8 nM. PI staining/flow cytometric
analysis showed an increase in the percentages of sub-G1
and G0/G1 fractions in RENCA cells 24 h after YM155
treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1C).

YM155 treatment downregulated

We conducted a therapeutic trial with YM155 alone,
IL-2 alone, and the combination of YM155 with IL-2 to
determine their antitumor effects on the progression of
both orthotopic and lung metastatic tumors in a luciferaseexpressing RENCA mouse model of RCC. The therapeutic
efficacy of a 1-week course of treatment with YM155 (1
mg/kg per day), a 2-week course of treatment with IL-2
with an interval of 3 days (16000 U/mouse/3 times),
and the combination of YM155 and IL-2 was evaluated
by demonstration of decreased tumor volume, analyzed
with an in vivo imaging and analysis (IVIS) instrument
(Figure 3A and 3B), and lower weights of orthotopic renal
and metastatic lung tumor tissues (Figure 4A and 4B,
respectively).
As shown in Figure 3B, tumor volume, as analyzed
by the IVIS instrument, was significantly smaller following
YM155 and IL-2 combination therapy, as compared with
treatment with IL-2 or YM155 alone (p = 0.000 and
0.026, respectively). Furthermore, the tissue weights of
the removed left kidney and bilateral lungs revealed that

We investigated whether YM155 could inhibit
survivin expression in RENCA cells, a mouse renal
carcinoma cell line, and found that YM155 significantly
suppressed survivin expression in a time- and dosedependent manner (Figure 2A and 2B, respectively) and
induced increasing expression of cleaved caspase-3.
Interestingly, the addition of YM155 resulted in higher
expression levels of phospho-Akt (Ser473) and phosphoAkt (Thr308) compared with those in the control group,
whereas it did not impact expression levels of other

the combination of YM155 with IL-2 induced significant
inhibition of tumor growth 14 days after treatment (Figure
4A and 4B, respectively). The combination of YM155 and
IL-2 induced a significant antitumor effect in orthotopic
renal and lung metastatic carcinomas compared with
that induced by administration of either agent alone. The
tissue weights of the orthotopic tumor and metastatic lung
tumors were correlated to luciferase expression levels,

groups.

elevated in patients with progressive cancer (molecular
mechanisms that regulate MDSC differentiation
and function). Therefore, it is increasingly clear that
successful cancer immunotherapy will require limiting
the immunosuppressive effects of these cell populations
(coordinated myeloid cell regulation by tumors). To
explore the potential mechanisms underlying the potent
antitumor effects elicited by the combination of YM155
and IL-2, the percentages of Gr-1+ CD11b+ MDSCs and
CD4+ Foxp3+ Tregs in peripheral blood were assessed.
Before treatment, the percentages of populations of Gr1+ CD11b+ MDSCs and CD4+ Foxp3+ Tregs were similar
among all groups (Figures 5A and 6A, respectively),
whereas the percentages of these populations in the IL2-treated group were reduced in comparison with those
in the PBS-treated group after 2 weeks of treatment.
Furthermore, the population of Gr-1+ CD11b+ MDSCs
(Figure 5B) and CD4+ Foxp3+ Tregs (Figure 6B) was

significantly downregulated following treatment with
the combination of YM155 and IL-2 compared with that
following IL-2 treatment. Next, we investigated Treg
and MDSC expression in orthotopic and metastatic lung
tumors by immunofluorescence staining, which confirmed
the presence of Gr-1+ CD11b+ MDSCs (Figure 5C) and
CD4+ Foxp3+ Tregs (Figure 6C) in RCC metastatic lung
tumor tissues following treatment with the combination of
YM155 and IL-2. In addition, histopathological analysis
of liver and other body tissue specimens indicated no
histological damage in any treatment group (data not
shown).

efficacy of molecular-targeted drugs for treatment of
RCC has been demonstrated, and improved therapeutic
responses are expected with treatment with the
combination of this class of drugs and cytokine therapy.
The objective of this study was to develop an effective
clinical therapy in patients with RCC to further improve
efficacy [12, 13, 24].
MDSCs and Treg cells are major components
of the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment
[25, 26]. Both cell types proliferate systematically in
preclinical tumor models and promote T-cell dysfunction,
which in turn favors tumor progression. MDSCs act
to suppress antitumor immunity through a number of
diverse mechanisms. T-cell activation is suppressed by
the production of reactive oxygen species and arginase,
which induces nitration of T-cell receptors and induction
of Tregs [26, 27].
In this study, the effects of the combination
therapy of IL-2 and YM155 were evaluated in three
animal models of RCC. The results showed that the
combination treatment had a greater antitumor efficacy
in a murine orthotopic renal and metastatic lung tumor
model compared with the efficacy of treatment with either

DISCUSSION
Survivin is highly expressed in cancer and
correlated with advanced disease, treatment resistance,
and metastasis [16]. YM155, a novel imidazolium-based
compound, has been shown to selectively suppress
survivin expression in several cell lines [19, 20].
IL-2 administration is the only systemic treatment
currently available that is capable of achieving a curative
effect in patients with metastatic RCC. In addition, the

drug alone. Therefore, we expected synergistic antitumor
effects by the combination of these agents or agents acting
independently via different modes.
At first, our in vitro assay with mouse RCC cells
demonstrated the cytotoxic effects of YM155, whereas
no cytotoxic effect was induced by treatment with IL-2
alone, which was reasonable because IL-2 was not able
to exhibit anticancer effects in the absence of immune
cells. Previous studies showed that YM155 is an effective
survivin inhibitor, and YM155 indeed induced dramatic
survivin downregulation by known mechanisms of
resistance to mTOR-inhibitor therapy, which included
mutations in FKBP-12 [21, 22] and mTOR, PI3K/AKT
[23] pathway activation, increased ERK/MAPK signaling,
and activation of PIM kinases, among others [21, 28].
In our study, we analyzed molecular events related to
YM155-treated RCC cells by dosage and time and found
that YM155 upregulated expression levels of the PI3K/

AKT pathway members p-AKTThr308, p-AKTSer473, and
cleaved caspase-3, suggesting that YM155 may activate
the AKT family to promote cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
of RENCA cells.
A previous study reported that YM155 treatment
sensitized myeloma cells to T cell-mediated antitumor
effects and, more importantly, can overcome the
microenvironment-mediated resistance of cancer cells
to T cell treatment [29]. Mice with tumors in human
MSC-coated scaffolds were treated with T cells alone,
YM155 alone, or the combination of both. YM155 and
T cell immunotherapy induced tumor regression on the
evaluation of tumor growth based on bioluminescent
signals. Moreover, the combination of YM155 with T
cells demonstrated a substantial antitumor effect. These
findings suggest that the repression of survivin with
the small-molecule YM155 synergized with cytotoxic
T lymphocytes and abrogated cell adhesion-mediated

immune resistance (CAM-IR) both in vitro and in vivo
[29]. YM155 can be used as a CAM-IR inhibitor in
combination with IL-2 resistance of RCC.
In in vivo experiment, intravenous administration
of YM155 killed cancer cells in both the orthotopic
renal tumor and metastatic lung tumors, while there was
no definite histological damage in the examined normal
organs.
The current study revealed that the combined
IP administration of YM155 plus IL-2 induced robust
therapeutic effects on both orthotopic renal and metastatic
lung tumors.
In mice, Treg cells occur as two distinct classes:
natural Treg (nTreg) cells, which comprise 5%–10% of
CD4+ cells, and induced Treg cells, which are the cellular
components of peripheral immune tolerance. nTreg
cells mature within the thymus and express the Foxp3
transcription factor. Experimental evidence indicates that

nTreg cells exist without peripheral antigenic stimulation.
To examine the anticancer immunomodulation in each
mouse, in this study, the proportion of peripheral CD4+
Foxp3+ nTreg [24] and Gr-1+ CD11b+ MDSCs [30] were
measured by FACS analysis.
Although treatment with YM155 alone had no
inhibitory effect on nTreg and MDSC populations,
these populations were significantly downregulated after
YM155 and IL-2 combination therapy in comparison
with treatment with IL-2 alone. Therefore, an in vivo
synergistic effect of YM155 treatment on the IL-2induced downregulation of peripheral Treg and MDSC
populations was observed in the current RCC model. This
immunological synergistic effect on suppression of Tregs
and MDSCs may explain the robust antitumor therapeutic
effects of YM155 and IL-2 combination therapy.
Several studies have investigated IL-2 as a T cell
growth factor that induce Fas-mediated elimination of

Tregs and MDSCs from the tumor microenvironment
and elicit synergistic antitumor responses coincident
with the efficient removal of Tregs and MDSCs in cancer
models [31]. We previously reported that IL-2 is a T cell
growth factor that is thought to play a critical role in the
regulation of T cell-dependent immune responses. Highaffinity IL-2 receptor-mediated cell signaling is critical
to Treg regulation in vivo [30]. Therefore, it appears that
the therapeutic effect of IL-2 is at least partially due to
immunological activation by the downregulation of Tregs
and MDSCs. These findings may provide a clue to clarify
the mechanisms of synergistic antitumor immunological
responses elicited by the combination of YM155 and IL2. Considering the rationale for the efficacy of YM155
combined with IL-2, different independent modes of
action of IL-2, which induce antitumor responses, and
the action of YM155, which causes apoptosis, may act
synergistically to kill RCC cells in vivo. In the background
of lymphocyte populations, IL-2 activates suppressor T
cells (Treg) in a normal state of immunosuppression. In
contrast, IL-2 readily stimulates cytotoxic T cells [12,
31]. The results of the present study revealed that IL-2
stimulated a positive immune response and reduced
populations of Treg cells and MDSCs when combined
with YM155 against the tumor immune response.
In conclusion, the combined administration of
YM155 and IL-2 exhibited a potent therapeutic effect in
a murine model of RCC without any definite toxicities.
These findings suggest combination therapy for both
primary and metastatic RCC.

the experiments. Animals were housed and handled in
accordance with the guidelines of the Okayama University
Animal Research Committee.

Drugs and antibodies
The survivin suppressor YM155 was obtained from
Selleck Chemicals Inc. (Houston, TX, USA). IL-2 was
kindly provided by Shionogi Co. (Osaka, Japan). Primary
antibodies against survivin, phosho-PDK1, phosho-PTEN,
AKT, phosho-AKT (Ser473), phosho-AKT (Ser308),
phosho-GSK-3β (Ser9), cleaved caspase-3, phosho-cRaf, and ɑ-tubulin were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA, USA).

XTT proliferation assay
The effect of YM155 on cell growth was determined
using a cell proliferation kit that employs the sodium
3´-[1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis
(4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzene sulfonic acid hydrate (XTT)
assay (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Aliquots
of 1 × 103 RENCA cells were seeded in 96-well plates
and incubated with medium alone or serial dilutions of
YM155. After 72 h, an XTT labeling mixture containing
an XTT labeling reagent and an electron coupling reagent
was added to the culture. After a 4-h incubation, the
absorbance at 450–500 nm with a reference wavelength
at 650 nm was recorded using a microplate reader (model
680; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Flow cytometry

Cell and cell culture

Treated cells were washed with PBS, fixed in
75% ethanol for 2 h at 4°C, and then suspended and
incubated in sodium citrate solution containing RNase
A (Roche Diagnostics) and propidium iodide (PI) (Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) in the dark for 30
min at 4°C. Flow cytometric analyses were performed
using a BD FASC Cabibur cytometer (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA, USA) and CellQuest software (BD
Biosciences). Blood samples from mice were collected
into tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA). The samples were then incubated with
phycoerythrin-labeled anti-mouse CD4 antibody and
fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse Foxp3
antibody or phycoerythrin-labeled anti-mouse Gr-1
antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antimouse CD11b antibody (all, eBioscience, Inc., San Diego,
CA, USA) for 1 h at 4°C and washed twice with PBS.
Next, the samples were resuspended in 250 μL of cold
PBS and analyzed using a fluorescence-activated cell
sorter (FACS) (Calibur flow cytometer; BD Biosciences)
with gating.

The human kidney clear cell carcinoma cell line
Caki-1, adenocarcinoma cell lines ACHN and KPK-1,
murine kidney carcinoma cell line RENCA, and Human
Renal Proximal Tubule Cells (RPTEC) were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville,
MD, USA). All cells were maintained in Roswell Park
Memorial Institute 1640 medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum or Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and cultured at
37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2.

performed and tumor volume was analyzed in all groups
on day 14 post-treatment. The mice were sacrificed, and
the weights of the orthotopic tumor in the left kidney and
sections of bilateral lung tissues with metastatic growth
were measured.

Cells were lysed with lysis buffer that
contained 50 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1piperazineethanesulfonic acid, pH 7.4), 250 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 µg/mL of leupeptin,
5 µg/mL of aprotinin, 2 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF, and
10 mM ß-glycerophosphate. Approximately 100 µg of
protein was suspended in Laemmli sample buffer (BD
Biosciences), boiled, and separated by sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels
were electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.), which was then
incubated with the indicated primary antibodies in 5%
BSA or nonfat milk in TBS-T overnight at 4°C. Next,
the membranes were washed and immediately incubated
with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies. Specific proteins were
detected by exposing membranes to x-ray film after
incubation with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent
(ECL kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Chandler, AZ,
USA).

Immunofluorescence staining
After deparaffinization and rehydration of tissue
sections, antigens were unmasked by blocking with 5%
normal goat serum and 0.3% Triton™ X-100 in PBS and

Imaging of RCC tumors in live mice

Statistical analysis

Tumors derived from stable luciferase-transfected
RENCA cells were imaged to observe luciferase
expression. Briefly, the animals were anesthetized and
then injected IP with luciferin (a substrate of luciferase) at
150 mg/kg in a volume of 100 μL. Images were captured
at a peak time of 20 min after injection using an IVIS-200
Imaging System (Xenogen Corporation, Alameda, CA,
USA) and then processed using Living Image software
(Xenogen Corporation) by region-of-interest analysis
of the total photons per second for each tumor with
appropriate background subtraction.

Data are expressed as mean values ± standard
deviation (SD). One-way analysis of variance followed
by Bonferroni’s post-hoc comparison tests was performed
for comparisons among multiple groups. A p value ˂ 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
