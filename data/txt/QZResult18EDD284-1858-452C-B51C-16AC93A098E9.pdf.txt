Abstract
The autocrine platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)/PDGF receptor (PDGFR)
signaling pathway promotes breast cancer tumorigenesis, but the mechanisms for
its dysregulation in breast cancer are largely unknown. In the study, we identified
PDGF-A as a novel transcriptional target of FoxM1. FoxM1 directly binds to two sites
in the promoter of PDGF-A and activates its transcription. Mutation of these FoxM1binding sites diminished PDGF-A promoter activity. Increased FoxM1 resulted in the
upregulation of PDGF-A, which led to activation of the AKT pathway and increased
breast cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis, whereas knockdown of FoxM1
does the opposite. Blocking AKT activation with a phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT
inhibitor decreased FoxM1-induced cell proliferation. Moreover, PDGF/AKT pathway
upregulates the expression of FoxM1 in breast cancer cells. Knockdown of PDGF-A or
blockade of AKT activation inhibited the expression of FoxM1 in breast cancer cells.
Furthermore, expression of FoxM1 significantly correlated with the expression of
PDGF-A and the activated AKT signaling pathway in human breast cancer specimens.
Our study demonstrates a novel positive regulatory feedback loop between FoxM1 and
the PDGF/AKT signaling pathway; this loop contributes to breast cancer cell growth
and tumorigenesis.

Introduction

of the development and progression of breast cancer
will highlight strategies for accurate diagnosis, early
intervention, and effective therapies.
Several pathways have been implicated in breast
cancer, including p53, epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), PDGF/PDGFR, PI3K/AKT, and mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) [2]. The AKT pathway is
strongly activated during breast cancer development and
progression. In one study, activation of AKT was observed
in approximately 80% of breast cancer patients and was

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy
and the leading cause of cancer-related death in
women worldwide [1]. Breast cancer death rates have
been declining in developed countries owing to early
detection and improved treatment, but incidence and
mortality rates have risen in developing areas [1], and
thus, breast cancer still remains a substantial clinical
challenge. Understanding the molecular mechanisms

associated with poor disease-free survival [3]. Studies
have shown that phosphorylation and activation of AKT
kinase is often achieved by stimulation of the PDGF
pathway through the binding of PDGFs to PDGFRs [4].
The activated PDGF pathway has been shown to prevent
cancer cells from undergoing apoptosis during epithelialmesenchymal transition and thus to promote breast cancer
progression and metastasis [5, 6].
PDGFs are key growth factors in many kinds of
tumors that are produced via autocrine or paracrine
regulation and contribute to malignant progression [7].
One study found that the metastatic potential of mammary
epithelial cancer cells requires an autocrine PDGF/
PDGFR loop, and targeting the PDGF/PDGFR signaling
was proved to therapeutically interfere with metastasis
of breast cancers [6]. PDGF consists of several isoforms:
alpha (A), beta (B), C, and D. Among these isoforms,
PDGF-A has been shown to be over-expressed frequently
in human breast tumors [8], and is an adverse prognostic
factor in patients with advanced breast cancer [9].
However, little is known about the mechanism of PDGF-A
dysregulation in human breast cancer.
FoxM1, a member of the Forkhead box transcription
factor family, was first discovered as an oncogene, plays
a key role in cell-cycle progression [10-12]. Aberrant
expression of FoxM1 has been observed in the majority
of human solid human tumors, including breast cancer
[13-20]. Like the PDGF/AKT signaling pathway, which
is also aberrantly activated in breast cancer, FoxM1 has
been implicated in breast tumorigenesis. Moreover, in
vivo and in vitro studies have also showed that FoxM1
depletion results in a significant reduction of cancer cell
proliferation and tumor formation, suggesting that the
consecutive expression of FoxM1 may act as a crucial
factor for tumor growth [13, 21-23]. Aberrant activation
or expression of FoxM1 also promotes the development
of acquired drug resistance in various tumors, including
breast cancer [24-28]. FoxM1 expression levels were
elevated in 87% of breast cancer patients and the
elevated FoxM1 levels were correlated with breast cancer
development [29]. Enhanced expression of FoxM1 in
breast cancer cells increased invasion and metastasis of
these cells [30] and increased acquired drug resistance as
well [26]. Moreover, several therapeutic targets for breast
cancer, such as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
and estrogen receptor alpha, may regulate the expression
of FoxM1 [31, 32], which underlines the importance of
FoxM1 as a therapeutic target in breast cancer treatment.
However, the mechanisms for the roles of FoxM1 in breast
cancer are largely unknown.
Since FoxM1 and the PDGF/AKT signaling
pathway are both dysregulated in breast cancer and since
both play important roles in breast tumorigenesis, in
this study we explored the relationship between them to
elucidate the responsible molecular mechanisms [6, 7, 30].
To our knowledge, we are the first to discover that FoxM1
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

activates the PDGF/AKT signaling pathway by directly
transactivating PDGF-A. We also found that the PDGF/
AKT signaling pathway increases FoxM1 expression.
Therefore, our findings elucidate a novel FoxM1/PDGF/
AKT regulatory feedback loop that promotes breast cancer
cell growth and tumorigenesis.

Results
FoxM1 activates the PDGF/AKT signaling
pathway and promotes breast cancer cell growth
We examined the expression levels of FoxM1 in two
mouse mammary carcinoma cell lines (4T07 and 4T1), in
two human mammary carcinoma cell lines (BT474 and
MDA-MB-231), and in an immortalized normal human
breast epithelial cell line (MCF 10A). FoxM1 levels were
high in MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells, were relatively low
in BT474 and 4T07 cells, and were barely detectable in
MCF 10A cells (Fig. 1A).
We next explored the regulatory relationship
between FoxM1 and the PDGF/AKT signaling pathway.
To determine the effect of FoxM1 on the PDGF/
AKT pathway, we used 4T07 cells with relatively low
endogenous FoxM1 to generate 4T07-FoxM1 stable
cell lines. We detected obvious elevation of PDGFR-A
phosphorylation (Tyr754) in two different 4T07-FoxM1
stable cell lines but no alteration in the total PDGFR-A,
suggesting that FoxM1 activated PDGFR-A (Fig. 1B,
left panel). Furthermore, FoxM1 elevated the levels of
phosphorylated AKT (Ser473), a downstream effector
of the PDGF pathway, but the total protein levels
remained the same (Fig. 1B, left panel). To determine the
endogenous effect of FoxM1 on the PDGF pathway, we
generated two MDA-MB-231-shFoxM1 stable cell lines
using MDA-MB-231 cells and found that knockdown
of FoxM1 decreased the activation and phosphorylation
of PDGFR-A and AKT (Fig. 1B, right panel). These
results indicate that FoxM1 activated the PDGF signaling
pathway.
We next analyzed the roles of FoxM1 in breast
tumor cell growth in vitro. Overexpression of FoxM1 in
4T07-FoxM1 stable cells significantly increased colony
formation (Fig. 1C) and cell proliferation (Supplementary
Fig. S1A), compared with control cells. Conversely,
knocking down FoxM1 in MDA-MB-231-shFoxM1 cells
significantly decreased colony formation (Fig. 1D) and
cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S1B), compared
with control cells. Together, these results suggest that
FoxM1 activated the PDGF/AKT signaling pathway and
promoted breast cancer cell growth.

FoxM1 positively regulates PDGF-A expression in
breast cancer cells

PDGF-A via transcription inhibition because doxycycline
hydrochloride dramatically decreased the promoter
activity of PDGF-A (Fig. 3C, lower panel).
To confirm the roles of the two putative
predictiveFoxM1-binding sites in mediating the response
of the PDGF-A promoter to FoxM1, we constructed two
reporter plasmids with a single mutation in site 1 or site 2
and another reporter plasmid with mutations in both sites
(Fig. 3A). The results show that mutation of site 1 or site
2 significantly decreased PDGF-A promoter activity, and
simultaneous mutation of both sites almost abolished the
promoter activity (Fig. 3D).
We further investigated whether FoxM1 activates
PDGF-A transcription by directly binding to these sites.
We performed EMSA assays by incubating the labeled
probes harboring site 1 or site 2 with the nuclear extracts
from MDA-MB-231 cells. A shift band was detected
using either of the two labeled probes, and the shift band
disappeared in samples with 50 times molar excess of the
unlabeled probe (Fig. 3E, upper panel). Moreover, adding
FoxM1 antibody further slowed the migration of the shift
band (Fig. 3E, upper panel), suggesting that FoxM1 binds
to site 1 and site 2 in the PDGF-A promoter. To determine
in vivo the binding site of FoxM1 to the PDGF-A
promoter, we performed a ChIP assay in MDA-MB-231
cells, which showed that FoxM1 bound to both site 1 and
site 2 in the PDGF-A promoter (Fig. 3E, lower panel).
Taken together, the above results indicate that FoxM1
bound directly to the PDGF-A promoter and activated
PDGF-A transcription in breast cancer cells.

The above results show that FoxM1 promoted
PDGFR-A phosphorylation without altering the total
PDGFR-A, suggesting that FoxM1 may activate the PDGF
pathway through signals upstream of PDGFR-A. PDGF-A,
as a homodimer or heterodimer with PDGF-B, can bind
to PDGFR-A and promote PDGFR-A dimerization
and tyrosine phosphorylation in the cytoplasm, which
then activates several signaling cascades. We therefore
analyzed the correlation of FoxM1 with PDGF-A in
different breast cancer cell lines and found that PDGF-A
expression level was positively correlated with FoxM1 in
these cell lines (Fig. 2A). We next overexpressed FoxM1
in two cell lines, BT474 and 4T07, which both have low
levels of endogenous FoxM1, and found that PDGF-A was
dramatically elevated in both cell lines (Fig. 2B, upper
panel). Also, 4T07-FoxM1 stable cells had higher levels
of PDGF-A expression and secretion than did the control
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A). FoxM1 elevates PDGF-A
levels via transcription activation because the mRNA
level of PDGF-A was increased in both 4T07 and BT474
cells (Fig. 2B, lower panels). Conversely, knocking down
FoxM1 in 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 cells, which have high
levels of endogenous FoxM1, significantly downregulated
both PDGF-A protein and mRNA expression (Fig. 2C).
Furthermore, MDA-MB-231-shFoxM1 stable cells had
lower levels of PDGF-A expression and secretion than did
the control stable cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B). These
results indicate that FoxM1 regulated PDGF-A in breast
cancer cells.

FoxM1 activates the AKT pathway and promotes
breast cancer cell growth through PDGF-A

PDGF-A is a direct transcriptional target of
FoxM1

Our data indicate that FoxM1 upregulated the
levels of PDGF-A and phospho-AKT in breast cancer
cells (Fig. 1B and D, Supplementary Fig. S4); therefore,
we investigated whether the activation of the AKT
pathway by FoxM1 depends on PDGF-A. In BT474 cells,
FoxM1 transfection significantly upregulated PDGF-A
expression; however, this effect was reversed by PDGF-A
shRNA transfection (Supplementary Fig. S5, left panel).
Conversely, in MDA-MB-231 cells, knockdown of
FoxM1 by shRNA decreased the phospho-AKT level,
and exogenous PDGF-AA reversed the effect of FoxM1
downregulation on the activation of the AKT signaling
pathway (Fig. 4A, left panel).
We next determined the role of FoxM1 in the
proliferation of breast cancer cells through the PDGF-A/
AKT pathway. BT474 cell growth significantly increased
after overexpression of FoxM1 but was suppressed after
simultaneous knockdown of PDGF-A (Supplementary Fig.
S5, right panel). Conversely, MDA-MB-231 cell growth
was inhibited after FoxM1 knockdown, but this inhibition
was largely reversed by exogenous PDGF-AA treatment

To determine whether FoxM1 transcriptionally
regulates PDGF-A directly, we searched the promoter
region of human PDGF-A (NM_002607) for the
consensus-binding site of FoxM1. Two potential FoxM1binding sites were observed in a 900-bp region upstream
of the transcriptional start site (Fig. 3A). We then assessed
the effect of altering FoxM1 on the activity of the
PDGF-A promoter in breast cancer cells. We found that
the activity of the PDGF-A promoter was increased by
FoxM1 overexpression in 4T07 cells and was decreased
by FoxM1 knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3B,
Supplementary Fig. S3).
We next generated a Tet-Off–based FoxM1
inducible MEF/3T3 cell line to control FoxM1 expression.
FoxM1 was repressed by culturing FoxM1-transfected
MEF/3T3 Tet-Off cells in the presence of doxycycline
hydrochloride, and PDGF-A was also dramatically
decreased after FoxM1 suppression (Fig. 3C, upper panel).
We found that doxycycline hydrochloride suppressed

the in vivo function of FoxM1 in tumorigenesis of breast
cancer cells, we performed FoxM1 loss-of-function studies
by injecting 4T1-shFoxM1 and MDA-MB-231-shFoxM1
cells into the mammary fat pads of nude mice. We found
that knockdown of FoxM1 inhibited tumorigenesis of 4T1
cells; the tumors of mice injected with 4T1-shFoxM1 cells
were significantly smaller than those of mice injected with
4T1 or 4T1-sh-control cells (Supplementary Fig. S6, left
panel). Likewise, knockdown of FoxM1 also significantly
inhibited tumorigenesis in human breast cancer MDAMB-231 cells (Fig. 4D, left panel).
We next detected the expression of FoxM1,
PDGF-A, and phospho-AKT (Ser473) using
immunohistochemical assay in the tumors from the above
in vivo experiments. Tumors from 4T07-FoxM1 cells had
higher levels of FoxM1, PDGF-A, and phospho-AKT than
did tumors from 4T07-pcDNA-control cells (Fig. 4C, right
panel). Furthermore, we also examined the expression
of Ki-67, a biomarker of tumor cell proliferation; Ki67 staining was significantly increasedin the tumors
from 4T07-FoxM1 cells that that from the control cells
(Supplementary Fig. S7A). In contrast, tumors from
4T1-shFoxM1 and MDA-MB-231-shFoxM1 cells had
lower levels of FoxM1, PDGF-A, and phospho-AKT
than did tumors from the sh-control cells (Fig. 4D and
Supplementary Fig. S6, right panel). Likewise, the Ki-67
staining was also decreased in the tumors after FoxM1
knockdown compared with the controls (Supplementary
Fig. S7B). Taken together, our results suggest that FoxM1
promoted breast tumorigenesis, at least partly, by elevating
PDGF-A expression and activating the AKT pathway.

through the AKT pathway.

FoxM1 expression positively correlated with
the expression of PDGF-A and phospho-AKT in
human breast tumors
To determine whether our findings have clinical
relevance in human breast cancer, we investigated the
expression of FoxM1, PDGF-A, and phospho-AKT in
human breast tumor samples. We analyzed the significance
of the FoxM1/PDGF-A/AKT axis in a panel of 67 human
breast cancer specimens and 10 adjacent non-tumor
tissues. The expression levels of FoxM1, PDGF-A, and
phospho-AKT were significantly higher in tumor tissues
than in non-tumor tissues (Fig. 6A). The expression levels
of FoxM1 directly correlated with those of PDGF-A and
phospho-AKT (Fig. 6B). These results further support the
essential role of FoxM1 in regulating PDGF-A induction
and AKT activation in human breast cancers and the role
of the FoxM1/PDGF-A/AKT axis in the pathogenesis
of human breast cancer. Collectively, our findings
demonstrate a positive regulatory feedback loop in which
FoxM1 transactivates PDGF-A expression and the AKT
signaling pathway, events that in turn elevate FoxM1
expression levels and promote breast tumor cell growth
and tumorigenesis (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
Our study demonstrates strong evidence supporting
a critical role for FoxM1 in regulating breast cell
tumorigenicity. We showed that FoxM1 enhances the
survival and growth of human breast cancer cells through
the PDGF/AKT signaling pathway. Specifically, FoxM1
stimulates the transcription of PDGF-A by directly binding
to its promoter at two sites, which in turn leads to the
activation of the AKT pathway, one of the most important
pathways underlying breast tumorigenesis. We also found
that the PDGF/AKT pathway elevates FoxM1 expression
and that the level of FoxM1 is significantly correlated with
that of PDGF-A and with the activity of the AKT pathway
in human breast cancers. The regulatory feedback between
FoxM1 and the PDGF/AKT pathway revealed in our study
may represent a critical mechanism for the proliferation
and tumorigenesis of human breast cancer (Fig. 6D).
Studies have shown that the formation and
progression of breast cancer depend on multiple
interactions of several proteins and signaling pathways
[6, 35]. Our study supports the notion that FoxM1
overexpression, upregulation of PDGF-A, and activation
of the PI3K/AKT pathway favor breast cancer cell
proliferation and tumorigenesis. Studies have shown that
FoxM1 stimulates the transcription of estrogen receptoralpha and is significantly correlated with estrogen receptoralpha in breast cancer cells [17]. Our study demonstrated

PDGF-A regulates FoxM1 through the AKT
pathway
To further reveal the crosstalk between FoxM1
and the PDGF pathway, we examined the effect of the
PDGF/AKT signaling pathway on FoxM1. Using a
reporter plasmid harboring the consensus FoxM1-binding
elements, we found that PDGF-A activated FoxM1mediated transcription and that this activation was blocked
by LY294002, an inhibitor of the AKT pathway (Fig. 5A).
To determine the effect of PDGF-A on FoxM1 expression
level, we treated BT474 cells with PDGF-AA and found
elevated FoxM1 levels (Fig. 5B). In contrast, knocking
down PDGF-A in MDA-MB-231 cells decreased the
expression of FoxM1 in the cells (Fig. 5C). Moreover, the
levels of phospho-AKT were increased after PDGF-AA
treatment but were decreased by knockdown of PDGF-A
in BT474 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (Fig. 5B
and C). Furthermore, LY294002 blocked the ability of
PDGF-AA to induce FoxM1 expression in BT474 cells
(Fig. 5D and E). Also, LY294002 blocked the cell growth
induced by PDGF-AA (Fig. 5D, right panel). Together,
these results indicate that PDGF-A regulated FoxM1

that FoxM1 activates the PDGF/AKT signaling pathway
by stimulating the transcription of PDGF-A in breast
cancer cells. Moreover, knockdown of PDGF-A blocks
FoxM1-induced cell proliferation. Therefore, our findings
elucidate a hitherto unexplored mechanism for FoxM1 in
breast cancer progression.
Previous studies have shown that the autocrine
PDGF/PDGFR signaling pathway promotes breast cancer
progression [5] and that inhibiting PDGFR-A expression

or activity by reducing its phosphorylation is an effective
strategy for molecular therapy in breast cancer or other
tumors [36]. PDGF-A, an important ligand of PDGFR,
induces PDGFR phosphorylation and activation. Although
previous studies have shown that PDGF-A is dysregulated
in breast cancer and is correlated with cancer stage and
rate of progression in breast cancer patients [9], the
mechanisms for this dysregulation are largely unknown.
Our results demonstrate that PDGF-A is a direct

Figure 6: FoxM1, PDGF-A, and phospho-AKT (p-AKT) are positively correlated in human breast cancer samples. (A)
Upper panel, expression of FoxM1, PDGF-A, and p-AKT was examined by immunohistochemical assay in 67 breast cancer specimens
and 10 adjacent normal tissues. Images shown are representatives of the examined samples. Magnification 200×. Lower panel, the level of
FoxM1, PDGF-A, and p-AKT staining was scored from 0 to 12. The expression of FoxM1, PDGF-A, and p-AKT between non-tumor (N)
and tumor specimens (T) were evaluated. **P < 0.01. (B) The expression correlations among FoxM1, PDGF-A, and p-AKT were significant
as determined by Pearson’s correlation test. r: Pearson correlation coefficient. (C) Schematic diagram shows the mechanism underlying
FoxM1, PDGF-A, and AKT: FoxM1 transcriptionally activates PDGF-A and the AKT signaling pathway; in return, the activated AKT
pathway upregulates FoxM1 expression, which forms a positive feedback loop and promotes breast cancer cell growth and tumorigenesis..

transcriptional target of FoxM1 and that the expression
of FoxM1 is significantly correlated with that of PDGF-A
in breast cancer. Moreover, FoxM1 activates the PDGF/
PDGFR pathway in breast cancer cells by stimulating
the transcription of PDGF-A. Thus, our findings reveal
a novel mechanism for PDGF-A dysregulation in breast
cancer and for the activation of PDGF/PDGFR signaling
in breast tumor progression.
We discovered a novel positive regulatory
feedback loop; these loops are a common mechanism for
consecutive activation of factors or signaling pathways
in tumor progression. We found that FoxM1 activates
the AKT pathway by stimulating the PDGF/PDGFR
pathway through PDGF-A. Moreover, we also found that
the PDGF/AKT pathway activates FoxM1 expression in
breast cancer cells. This regulatory feedback loop between
FoxM1 and PDGF/AKT maintains the consecutive
activation of the AKT signaling pathway, which may be a
critical mechanism for breast tumor progression.
In summary, our findings show crosstalk between
FoxM1 and the PDGF/AKT signaling pathway in
human breast cancer. Owing to the great importance of
the FoxM1/PDGF-A/AKT axis in human cancers, our
findings strongly suggest that targeting FoxM1 may be an
alternative therapeutic strategy for breast cancer.

Human breast cancer tissue microarray (BR1503a)
was purchased from US Biomax. Sixty-seven patients were
enrolled in this study. None of these patients underwent
preoperative chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The
median age was 49 years (range, 19-69 years). Of the 67
patients, 7 (10.4%) presented with intraductal carcinoma
(tumor-node-metastasis stage (TNM), TisN0M0), and 60
patients (89.6%) had invasive ductal carcinoma. Of these
60 patients, 7 (11.7%) had TNM stage I tumors, 34 had
(56.7%) TNM stage II tumors, 14 (23.3%) had TNM stage
III tumors, and 5 (8.3%) had TNM stage IV tumors.

Plasmids, siRNA, and transfection
The pcDNA3.1-FoxM1 and pSilencer-shFoxM1
plasmids were constructed as described previously
[16]. pSilencer-shFoxM1 and pSilencer-shPDGF-A
were constructed using the following target sequences:
FoxM1,
5’-CUCUUCUCCCUCAGAUAUA-3’;
PDGF-A, 5’-CUGAAUCCGGAUUAUCGGGAA-3’.
pSilencer-shcontrol expressing a hairpin shRNA with
limited homology to any known sequences in the human,
mouse, and rat genomes was also constructed and was
used as a control. Mutagenesis in the PDGF-A promoter
was introduced using the QuikChange site-directed
mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies).
The siGENOME SMART pool siRNA targeting
FoxM1 and the scramble siRNA were purchased from
Dharmacon. For siRNA transfection, cells were transfected
into FoxM1 siRNA or scramble siRNA at a final
concentration of 50 nM using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
transfection reagent (Life Technologies), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
BT474, MDA-MB-231, 4T07, and 4T1 breast
cancer cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 1% penicillin/ streptomycin, and 1% glutaMAX
(Invitrogen). MCF 10A cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 supplemented with 5%
heat-inactivated horse serum (Life Technologies), insulin
(10 μg/mL, Life Technologies), cholera toxin (100 ng/
mL, Sigma-Aldrich), hydrocortisone (0.5 μg/mL, SigmaAldrich), recombinant epidermal growth factor (20 ng/
mL, Life Technologies), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
The MEF/3T3 Tet-Off cell line from Clontech was used
to stably express the tetracycline-controlled transactivator.
Recombinant human PDGF-AA was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich, and the final treatment concentration was
10 ng/mL. Doxycycline hydrochloride was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and was used at a final concentration
of 1 µg/mL. The specific phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K)/AKT inhibitor LY294002 was purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology and was used at a final
concentration of 10 µM.

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed using radioimmunoprecipitation
assay buffer (Tris-hydrochloric acid (50 mM), pH 8.0;
sodium chloride (150 mM); 1% NP-40; 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate; 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate; and
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (2 mM)) containing
protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich). Protein
extracts were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (EMD
Millipore). The membranes were incubated with antibodies
against FoxM1 (sc-500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
PDGF-A (NBP1-19781, Novus Biologicals), PDGFR-A
(sc-338, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-PDGFRA
(Tyr 754) (sc-12911, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), AKT
(#9272, Cell Signaling Technology), phospho-AKT
(Ser473) (#9271, Cell Signaling Technology). β-actin was

DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated using an
antibody against FoxM1. DNA was purified and then
subjected to semiquantitative PCR analysis using sitespecific primers (Supplementary Table S1).

Cell viability and colony formation assays
We performed cell viability assays using a TACS
XTT assay kit (R&D Systems). Briefly, cells were plated
in 96-well plates (1×104/well) and were treated with
PDGF-AA or LY294002 for 24 hours. We added 50 µL
of XTT working solution (combining XTT reagent with
XTT activator) to each well. After incubating the cells
for 6 hours, we obtained the absorbance values at 490 nm
with a reference correction at 630 nm in an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay plate reader (Thermo Scientific).
Data were obtained from three independent assays in
triplicate.
We performed colony formation assays as described
previously [16]. Only colonies containing more than
50 cells were scored. Data shown are mean number of
colonies observed in six randomly chosen microscopic
fields (magnification ×200).

Mammary fat pad tumor growth

Promoter reporters and luciferase reporter assay

Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS
version 16.0. We used a two-tailed Student t test to
determine the significance of the in vitro results and a
one-way analysis of variance to determine the significance
of the in vivo data. We determined the significance of
differences in the human tissue data using Pearson’s
correlation test. P values less than 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.

Female athymic BALB/c nude mice were purchased
from the National Cancer Institute and were maintained
in institutional facilities approved by the Association
for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care. Breast cancer cells were injected into the mammary
fat pads of nude mice, and the diameters of the resulting
tumors were measured once every 5 days. Three to four
weeks later, the mice were killed, and the tumors were
dissected. Tumor samples were fixed in formalin for
hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemical analysis.

Statistical analysis

We used PDGF-A promoter reporter plasmids [33],
mutant PDGF-A promoter reporter plasmids, or FoxM1dependent luciferase promoter reporter plasmids [23].
Cells in 24-well plates were transfected with each reporter
plasmid and Renilla luciferase (pRL-TK) vector plasmid.
Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested
for firefly/Renilla luciferase assays using the Dual-Glo
luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Luciferase
activities were normalized to the cotransfected pRL-TK
plasmid. All experiments were performed at least twice
in triplicate.
