ABSTRACT
Phosphoinositide (PIP) phosphatases such as myotubularins (MTMs) inhibit
growth factor receptor signaling. However, the function of myotubularin-related
protein 7 (MTMR7) in cancer is unknown. We show that MTMR7 protein was downregulated with increasing tumor grade (G), size (T) and stage (UICC) in patients with
colorectal cancer (CRC) (n=1786). The presence of MTMR7 in the stroma correlated
with poor prognosis, whereas MTMR7 expression in the tumor was not predictive
for patients’ survival. Insulin reduced MTMR7 protein levels in human CRC cell
lines, and CRC patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or loss of imprinting
(LOI) of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) had an increased risk for MTMR7 loss.
Mechanistically, MTMR7 lowered PIPs and inhibited insulin-mediated AKT-ERK1/2
signaling and proliferation in human CRC cell lines. MTMR7 provides a novel link
between growth factor signaling and cancer, and may thus constitute a potential
marker or drug target for human CRC.

factor receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are common
in tumors [1] [2] and underlie non-response to current
clinical therapies [7]. Thus, new drugable targets that
inhibit RTK signaling are needed [8].
We identified myotubularin-related protein 7
(MTMR7) [9], a member of the myotubularin (MTM)
lipid phosphatase family [10], as an inhibitor of insulin
signaling. MTMs consist of N-terminal plextrin homology
(PH), central protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) and
C-terminal SET-interaction (SID) and coiled coiled
(CC) domains [11]. Heterodimers are formed between
catalytically active and inactive enzymes, e.g. MTMR6/7/8
with MTMR9 [12], which dephosphorylate phosphatidyl-

INTRODUCTION
Chronic or constitutive stimulation of receptors for
insulin, insulin-like (IGF) and epidermal (EGF) growth
factors activates RAS-ERK1/2 and PI3K-AKT-mTOR
signaling [1] [2]. Increased activity of those proteins
involved in signal transduction and secretion of ligands
drive tumor initiation and progression in colorectal cancer
(CRC) [3]. Thereby, hyperinsulinemia may contribute
to an increased cancer risk in patients with type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [4–6]. However, the molecular
pathways which link metabolism and cancer are unknown.

Genetic alterations of the MTMR7 gene in
human CRC

inositol-3-monophosphate (PI(3)P) and -3,5-bisphosphate
(PI(3,5)P2) at the 3’-position of inositol. MTMs localize to
endosomal-lysosomal membranes, initiate vesicle trafficking
and autophagy [10] and are mutated in human congenital
neuromuscular diseases (such as MTM1) [11]. MTMR7 is
also present in a soluble form in the cytoplasm using free
inositol-1,3-bisphosphate (Ins(1,3)P2) as a substrate [9].
MTMR7 was detected in brain, muscle, liver and kidney
[9], whereas its expression and function in the colorectum
is unknown.
We show that MTMR7 inhibited insulin-mediated
activation of AKT and ERK1/2 signaling and reduced
proliferation of human CRC cells. MTMR7 protein was
down-regulated in human CRC cells and patient tissues.
Expression of MTMR7 in the tumor was independent
of prognosis, whereas stromal MTMR7 predicted poor
survival in CRC patients. Thus, MTMR7 may constitute a
potential target or marker for CRC and a possible link in the
cross-talk of lipid phosphatases and growth factor signaling.

In silico screening of a large series of CRC
patients using the cBioportal of Cancer Genomics [13,
14] was conducted on the data sets: TCGA_Provisional
(n=631 cases) and TCGA_Nature2012 (n=195 cases)
[3]. The MTMR7 gene was altered in 10%, MTMR9 in
6% of patient cases (n=826) (Figure 2A). Mining of the
human cancer cell line encyclopedia (CCLE) data base
evinced alterations of MTMR7 in 11% and of MTMR9
in 16% of cell lines (n=1019) [15] (data not shown). The
overall alteration rate of MTMR7 and MTMR9 genes
was <10% in 86 cancer studies from >15 different tumor
entities, indicating that the two genes are of importance
beyond CRC (Supplementary Table S1 and S2). In CRC,
alterations were mainly due to genomic deletions and
changes in mRNA expression levels, whereas the somatic
mutation rate was low (<1%). The down-regulation
of mRNA correlated with copy number alterations
(CNAs) for both genes (Figure 2B) and patient data sets
(Supplementary Figure S2). A strong co-occurrence of
alterations in MTMR7 and MTMR9 genes was observed
in human CRC (n=631 cases; Odds ratio >3, *p<0.001,
Fisher Exact test) and the CCLE (n=1019; Odds ratio
1.552, *p<0.001, Fisher Exact test), consistent with the
biochemical evidence that MTMR7 forms heterodimers
with MTMR9 [9]. Both genes colocalized to the short
arm of chromosome 8 (8p21-p23) which is frequently
subjected to genomic rearrangements in cancers [16, 17]
(Figure 2C), providing an underlying structural basis for
the alterations observed in the cBioportal data sets.

RESULTS
Expression of MTMR7 in intestinal tissues and
cell lines
Three different primer sets were designed to amplify
the N- and C-terminal ends and the central (mid) region
of the full-length (FL) MTMR7 cDNA (Figure 1A). RTqPCR analyses showed that MTMR7 mRNA was present
in six human CRC cell lines (SW480, HCT116, Caco2,
HT29, LOVO, DLD1) and in non-cancer HEK293T cells.
We then PCR-amplified and inserted FL MTMR7 cDNA
from HCT116 cells into pTarget (pT) expression vector.
HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with pTMTMR7 plasmid, and total cell lysate (TCL) expressing
the ectopic 76 kDa protein was used as a positive control
for validation of MTMR7 Ab (from Abcam) compared to
negative control cells transfected with empty vector (EV).
Western blot analyses (Figure 1B) demonstrated expression
of endogenous 76 kDa MTMR7 protein in a subset of CRC
cell lines (HCT116, LOVO, DLD1). Transformed (AGS,
PATU8902) and non-cancer cell lines of different tumor
types or species (e.g. COS7) were positive as well (not
shown). Abs specific for the C-terminal part of MTMR7
recognized an additional band at 54 kDa (unpublished
observation), indicating that protein isoforms or mRNA
variants may exist as described for mice [9]. MTMR7
mRNA was also detected in frozen samples of normal colon
(NC) and tumor (TU) tissues from CRC patients (Figure
1C) and in mouse organs (Supplementary Figure S1). RTqPCR analyses revealed coexpression of MTMR9/Mtmr9
mRNAs with MTMR7/Mtmr7 in all tissues and cell lines
examined. MTMR7 mRNA was down-regulated in 63 %
of CRC samples compared to matched normal colon tissue
(n=19 cases), indicative of a loss of expression in a subset
of tumors.

Loss of MTMR7 protein is a common event in
human CRC
To visualize expression of MTMR7 protein in situ,
we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) on normal
human colon tissue with the Ab (from Abcam) used for
Western blotting (Supplementary Figure S3). MTMR7
staining was found to be weak in the cytoplasm of normal
intestinal epithelial cells, but was most prominent in
smooth muscle cells of the muscularis mucosae and in
perivascular smooth muscle cells of the submucosa. Single
MTMR7 positive stromal cells in the lamina propria
partially colocalized with alpha-smooth muscle actin and
macrophages (data not shown).
MTMR7 was present in human CRC tumor cells or
completely absent. To explore the clinical significance of
this dichotome MTMR7 expression, tissue microarrays
(TMAs) with tumor and adjacent stroma tissue of a
large CRC patient cohort were analysed (Figure 3A).
Univariate statistical evaluation of the stainings evinced an
inverse relation between MTMR7 positivity and clinical
parameters (Supplementary Figure S4, Supplementary
Table S3). Consistent with the findings on MTMR7 mRNA

expression, MTMR7 protein was lost in 77.5 % (n=1776)
of tumor and 35.4 % (n=1786) of stroma samples. There
was no correlation between MTMR7 positivity and
patient age or gender. However, MTMR7 expression was
higher in the distal colon (sigmoid and rectum) than in

the proximal colon (coecum and ascending colon) both in
tumor and stroma (*p<0.001). MTMR7 positivity in tumor
cells was negatively associated with local tumor growth
(T1/2 vs. T3/4: *p=0.003), tumor stage (UICC I-IV:
*p=0.027) and grade (G: *p=0.015). These data indicated

group of CRC cases with neither IGF2 LOI nor T2DM
(n=16). A similar association (OR: 8.57,*p= 0.0209) was
stated for CRC patients with T2DM (n=17). MTMR7 loss
was exclusively detected in specimens of malignant tissue.
There was no case of reduced MTMR7 expression in the
benign colonic mucosa, neither in cases of T2DM nor in
healthy individuals. Thus, metabolic factors which activate
RTK signaling positively correlate with loss of MTMR7 in
human CRC.

that MTMR7 is lost during dedifferentiation and invasive
growth of the tumor, consistent with a putative role for
MTMR7 as a tumor suppressor in the colon.

MTMR7 protein in the stroma is a negative
predictor of CRC patient survival
Regarding prognostic relevance, we found that
MTMR7 positivity in the stroma tissue surrounding the
tumor cells was associated with a reduced 5- and 10year survival rate for patients with CRC in the UICC
stage 1 (Figure 3B). This held true for overall survival
(OS) (5-year: MTMR7 stroma negative 88 % vs. 76 %
positive; 10-year: MTMR7 stroma negative 78 % vs. 69
% positive) and tumor-specific survival (TSS) (5-year:
MTMR7 stroma negative 96 % vs. 88 % positive; 10-year:
MTMR7 stroma negative 93 % vs. 86 % positive) (n=345
cases, *p=0.032, log rank test). However, there was no
association between MTMR7 protein expression in the
tumor and survival at any UICC stage (Supplementary
Table S4). In silico screening of additional data sets
(TCGA_Nature, _Cell, _Provisional [3]) using cBioportal
[13, 14] revealed that MTMR7 (but not MTMR9) was
of prognostic value in other tumor entities including
liver, pancreas, head and neck or renal cancer. However,
conclusions were limited due to low case numbers
(Supplementary Table S5).

MTMR7 decreases cellular PI(3)P levels
To elucidate the function of MTMR7 in cells, we
measured the enzymatic activity of the phosphatase by
ELISA. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with
EV or MTMR7 plasmid for 48 h, and overexpression of
76 kDa MTMR7 protein was confirmed by Western blot
(Figure 5A). PIPs were quantified in total acidic lipids
extracted from cells after precipitation of the proteins.
The amount of mono-phosphorylated PI(3)P was reduced
in MTMR7-transfected cells to 54±16 % (n=4, *p=0.016,
Wilcoxon signed rank test) compared with EV controls
(MTMR7 106±29 vs. EV 230±78 pmol/106 cells) (Figure
5A). Similar results were obtained from SW480 and
HCT116 cells (data not shown). Levels of PI(3,4,5)P3
were not altered (not shown), corroborating the specificity
of MTMR7 towards PI(3)P. MALDI-MS imaging of
frozen cell pellets revealed no changes in PI ion intensity,
irrespective of the type of fatty acid side chain attached
to the glycerol moiety, either (Figure 5B). These data
confirmed the enzymatic activity and substrate specificity
of MTMR7 and allowed us to explore the function of this
phosphatase in human CRC cells.

MTMR7 is lost in CRC under conditions of
active insulin/IGF2 signaling
To identify factors which influence MTMR7
expression, we analysed a second independent cohort of
CRC patients with metabolic parameters known to activate
RTK signaling: type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and loss
of imprinting (LOI) of the IGF2 gene in the tumor. The
collection consisted of CRC tumor samples (n=113), normal
colon biopsies of healthy individuals (n=8) and normal colon
tissue adjacent to the tumor site of T2DM patients (n=9).
While detectable in all samples of benign colon tissue (n=17),
MTMR7 staining was absent in 55% (62 of 113) of the CRC
samples (Figure 4A, Supplementary Table S6). The negative
correlation between MTMR7 positivity and tumor grade
was confirmed: 64 % (7 of 11) of G1 tumors were positive
for MTMR7, in contrast to 47 % (33 of 70) of G2 tumors
and 32 % (8 of 25) of G3 tumors. There was no correlation
between MTMR7 and additional tumor specifications or
patient characteristics such as KRAS mutations or the body
mass index (data not shown). We then separately analysed
samples of CRC cases with T2DM (n=17) or IGF2 LOI
(n=13). MTMR7 was lost to a higher percentage in tumor
tissues of both patient groups (T2DM: 88%, 15 of 17; IGF2
LOI: 92%, 12 of 13) than in individuals with neither T2DM
nor IGF2 LOI (44%, 7 of 16) (Figure 4B). IGF2 LOI (n=13)
was associated with a higher risk for loss of MTMR7 in the
tumor (OR: 13.71, *p= 0.0157) compared with the control

MTMR7 inhibits insulin-mediated AKT and
ERK1/2 signaling in human CRC cells
Since PIPs activate RTK signaling [2], we tested
whether the PIP phosphatase MTMR7 is able to inhibit RTK
signaling. Two exemplary down-stream signaling pathways,
the AKT-mTOR and ERK1/2 cascades, were studied.
HEK293T, SW480 and HCT116 cells were transiently
transfected with MTMR7 or EV plasmids for 48 h, followed
by serum-deprival for 16 h and subsequent stimulation with
insulin (50 ng/ml) for 0 to 30 min. To measure the rapid time
course of AKT-mTOR-S6K-S6RP pathway activation, two
phosphorylation sites on AKT1/2 were analysed, the THR308
residue, which is the target of PI3K, PIPs and PDK, and the
SER473 residue, which is addressed by a feed forward loop
through the mTORC2 complex [18]. Western blot analyses
(Figure 6A) showed that insulin increased phosphorylation
at both AKT sites. Overexpression of MTMR7 reduced
phosphorylation on both residues compared to EV controls
(S473: EV 2.2±0.2 vs. MTMR7 1.0±0.3 *107, *p=0.0206, n=4;

pathway, was also lowered (EV 2.4±0.2 vs. MTMR7 0.8±0.2

Vice versa, knock-down of endogenous MTMR7
protein in HCT116 cells (by ~52%) upon transfection of
MTMR7-shRNA plasmid accelerated cell proliferation
compared with cells receiving control shRNA plasmid
(sh MTMR7 3.2 ± 0.5 % vs. sh Control 1.1 ± 0.2 %,
n=3, *p=0.004, t-test) (Figure 7B). Similar results were
obtained from LOVO cells (sh MTMR7 1.6 ± 0.2 % vs. sh
Control 1.2 ± 0.1 %, n=3, p=0.096, t-test). KRAS-WT cells
(Caco2, HT29, HEK293T) were less sensitive to MTMR7
silencing than KRAS-mutant cells (HCT116, LOVO,
SW480, DLD1) (Supplementary Figure S6). Thus, loss of
endogenous MTMR7 protein resulted in increased tumor
cell proliferation, consistent with the observation that

MTMR7 was down-regulated during CRC progression in
patients.

MTMR7 protein is down-regulated by insulin in
human CRC cell lines
We finally asked whether long-term exposure of
human CRC cells to growth factors reduces MTMR7 protein
similar to the observed loss of MTMR7 in CRC patients.
To this end, HCT116 cells were grown to 30% confluency
and then incubated in full medium (control) or full medium
supplemented with insulin (at 50 ng/ml) for 1 to 7 days.
Western blot analyses of TCLs demonstrated that MTMR7

with high expression of MTMR7 in terminal differentiated
tissues (such as smooth muscle cells). In contrast, MTMR7
protein was decreased in presence of insulin already after 1-2
days compared to controls (insulin 0.79 ± 0.06 vs. control
1.23 ± 0.08; n=7; *p=0.0294; two-way ANOVA) (Figure
8A). Similar results were collected from LOVO and DLD1

cells (not shown). In contrast, recombinant growth factors
(IGF1, IGF2, EGF), serum shock [20% (v/v) FCS], starvation
[0% (v/v) FCS] or other stimuli (rosiglitazone, H2O2) had no
effect (Supplementary Figure S7 and S8). Neither insulin nor
any other stimuli tested diminished the expression of MTMR7
mRNA (data not shown), suggesting a (post)translational
mechanism that has to be studied in the future.

Figure 8: Insulin decreases cellular MTMR7 protein. A. HCT116 cells were incubated with or without insulin (at 50 ng/ml) in full
medium for the times indicated, followed by Western blotting. OD values from MTMR7 bands in gels were calculated as -fold ± S.E. of day 0
in control cells (n=3; *p<0.05 insulin vs. control; two-way ANOVA). B. Model for MTMR7 function and regulation by insulin. MTMR7 lowers
PI3P levels, which results in a decrease of growth factor-mediated AKT/ERK signaling, resulting in inhibition of proliferation of CRC cells. In
contrast, insulin itself leads to down-regulation of MTMR7 protein, thus preventing the inhibitory effect of MTMR7 on growth factor signaling.

insulin also down-regulated MTMR7 protein expression
in human CRC cell lines. MTMR7 silencing may thus be a
consequence of enhanced growth factor signaling, and its
association with CRC progression implicates that MTMR7
restricts or terminates RTK signals.
No prognostic relevance was found for expression
of MTMR7 protein in the tumor. Instead, MTMR7 was
strongly present in smooth muscle cells of the tumorstroma. The positive association of stromal MTMR7 with
poor survival in UICC stage I CRC patients may implicate
tumor-stroma interactions via secreted growth factors
[1, 2]. MTMs are activators of autophagy and AMPK
signaling [33]. In stroma cells surrounding the tumor
with high levels of MTMR7, AMPK may thereby evoke
metabolic adaptation to lack of nutrients or oxygen that
promotes tumor growth and confers poor prognosis for the
patient. More than 65 % of stroma tissue adjacent to the
tumor still expressed MTMR7 protein. Thus, future pre/
clinical studies have to explore the function of MTMR7 in
the tumor microenvironment and its potential as a marker
or drug target in human CRC.

Collectively, these data indicated that insulin downregulates MTMR7 protein as an endogenous inhibitor
of growth factor receptor signaling, thereby establishing
a potential vicious cycle promoting the proliferation of
cancer cells (Figure 8B).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we described MTMR7 as an inhibitor
of insulin signaling in human CRC cells. MTMR7
attenuated two major pathways important for cell
proliferation and survival, the AKT and ERK1/2 cascades.
This mechanism applied to human cell lines derived from
colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic cancer and to embryonic
kidney cells, alluding at a more general principle. MTMR7
decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by MEK1/2 on
202/185TEY204/187 and of AKT on S473/T308 residues.
Hence, MTMR7 did not block single mTORC1/2
complexes, as described for MTM1 [19, 20] or MTMR3
[21], what would have abrogated phosphorylation
exclusively on either SER473, which is part of the
AKT-mTORC2 feed forward loop, or THR308, which
is targeted by PI3K-PDK1. Instead, MTMR7 inhibited
upstream components in these pathways resulting in a
decreased production of the lipid second messenger PI(3)
P. MTMR8 binds PI3K thereby reducing PI3K activity
[22]. Thus, direct inhibition of PI3K by MTMR7 may
explain our findings, given the structural homology
between MTMR7 and MTMR8 and the similarity in
binding of both enzymes to MTMR9 [9, 12]. Inhibition
of the AKT pathway by MTMs has been reported for T
lymphocytes [23] and myotubes [24, 25] in mice and
zebrafish [22]. Thus, our data may contribute to redefine
MTMs from “survival” [19, 20, 23, 26] towards “tumor
suppressor” phosphatases similar to PTEN [27]. MTMR7
blocked RTK signaling in KRAS-WT and KRAS-mutated
cells, and there was no correlation between MTMR7 loss
and KRAS-mutations in CRC patients. MTMR7 as a dual
AKT-ERK1/2 inhibitor may thus be a possible candidate
for novel therapeutical strategies also against RAS-mutated
tumors [28, 29].
Hyperinsulinemia increases growth factor signaling
even if the metabolic function of insulin is disturbed
[2]. Peripheral insulin resistance augments IGF1 levels
[30], and loss of imprinting (LOI) of the IGF2 gene is
associated with poor survival in CRC [31, 32]. Hence,
the patient subgroups in our study represented clinical
situations of active growth factor signaling, due to
systemic or local secretion of RTK ligands. T2DM and
IGF2 LOI were associated with a higher risk for MTMR7
loss in CRC patients. MTMR7-negative tumors may
therefore have a growth advantage under those conditions.
MTMR7 was expressed in the benign human colonic
tissue of all cases. Thus, loss of MTMR7 did not occur
before or during tumor initiation but rather at a later step
of tumor progression. Consistent with this observation,

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
Histological specimens were obtained by surgical
resection of primary tumors or metastases. Samples
were collected, histologically classified and stored as
formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) or fresh
frozen material. Specimens were provided as tissue
microarray (TMA, n=1786, Supplementary Table S3) [34]
or whole tissue sections [35, 36]. The patient collective
(Supplementary Table S6) with known metabolic
parameters (T2DM, LOI IGF2) comprised tumor samples
of CRC patients (total n=113) and normal colon biopsies
from 8 healthy male individuals and 9 tissue samples from
normal colon adjacent to the tumor from CRC patients
with T2DM (total n=17). The study was approved by the
Ethics Committees of the Universities of Heidelberg and
Kiel.

Detection of IGF2 LOI
Genomic DNA was extracted from fresh frozen CRC
and normal mucosa samples using Purigene Kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany) and genotyped for a single-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) (820 A/G, refSNP IDrs680) located in
the IGF2 exon 9 using an allele-specific PCR with primers
IGF2rs680F 5’-GAATTGGCTGAGAAACAATTGGC-3’
and IGF2rs680Rt 5’-CCACCTGTGATTTCTGGGGT-3’
specific for the “A” allele und IGF2rs680Rc 5’-CCAC
CTGTGATTTCTGGGGC-3’ specific for the “G” allele. Betaglobin forward 5’-GGTTGGCCAATCTACTCCCAGG-3’
and reverse 5’-GGTTGGCCAATCTACTCCCAGG-3’
primers were used to control for DNA-quality. The PCR

was performed with 95°C for 2 min followed by 10 x cycles
(94°C for 20 sec, 65°C for 1 min) and 35 cycles (94°C for 20
sec, 62°C for 1 min and 72°C for 30 sec).

FCS, defined as “serum shock”, or cells were kept at 0%
(v/v) FCS in DMEM without any supplements, defined as
“starvation”. Cells were harvested on a daily basis over
a time period of 1-7 days. Untreated (control) cells were
kept in a duplicate dish in full medium and were harvested
at the same time points as the treated cells. Cells reached
confluency after 3 days and were left in the post-confluent
state until day 7.
For time course experiments detecting phosphorylated
proteins, 1.5x106 cells were seeded per 10 cm dish. The
day after, cells were transfected for 6 h before replacement
to full medium and incubation for additional 42 h. Cells
were then serum-deprived for 16 h in DMEM without any
supplements followed by restimulation (with insulin, EGF
or TPA) in DMEM without any supplements for 0-60 min
before harvesting.

Reagents
Chemicals were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt,
Germany) or Sigma (Heidelberg, Germany). Antibodies
were MTMR7 (#121222, Abcam, Cambridge, UK),
phospho-AKT-S473 (#4060), phospho-AKT-T308 (#13038),
AKT (#9272), phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (#4858), S6
ribosomal protein (#2217), phospho-ERK1/2 (#4370) (all
from Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), ERK2 (sc-154), HSP90
(sc-7947) (both from Santa Cruz Biotech., CA) and betaactin (A1978, Sigma). Rosiglitazone (rosi) was obtained
from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, Michigan).
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and human
recombinant IGF1/2 were from Sigma, insulin and EGF from
Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany.

Gene silencing
SiRNA oligonucleotides were from Dharmacon
(SMARTpool: ON-TARGETplus, Thermo Scientific,
Lafayette, CO). Cells (500.000/well of a 6-well plate)
were transiently transfected for 48 h with a mixture of four
MTMR7-specific siRNAs provided as a single reagent or
control siRNA using Oligofectamin (Thermo Scientific)
as recommended by the manufacturer. ShRNA plasmids
were from Qiagen (SureSilencing #KH17308, Hilden,
Germany). One control and four separate shRNA designs
(MTMR7 NM_004686) were provided and packaged in
the same plasmid backbone (pGeneClip, Promega). Cells
(500.000/well of a 6-well plate) were transfected with the
shRNA-control plasmid or a mixture (1:1:1:1) of the four
MTMR7-shRNA plasmids (500 ng/well) using Turbofect
for 6 h followed by cultivation in full medium for 1-7 days
as suggested by the manufacturer.

Expression plasmids
The human full-length (FL) cDNA of MTMR7 (start
codon MEHIRT, aa 1-660, 76 kDa, NM_004686.4) was
amplified from total RNA extracted from HEK293T cells
and inserted with and without an N-terminal FLAG-tag
into pTarget (pT) vector (Promega GmbH, Mannheim,
Germany). Empty vector (EV) pT was used as a negative
control.

Cell culture
Human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) and CRC
cell lines were from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC, Rockville, MD). Cell lines were maintained at
37° C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95%
air in high-glucose DMEM (#41965) supplemented
with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS) (#SV30160), 20
mM glutamine and penicillin / streptomycin (1000 units/
ml; all from from Thermo Scientific), herewith defined
as “full” medium. Stably transfected clones of parental
cell lines were maintained as previously described [36].
In brief, HCT116 and SW480 cells were transfected
with pT-MTMR7 or empty vector (EV) using Turbofect
(Thermo Scientific) for 6 h, followed by a change to full
medium and incubation for additional 42 h. Thereafter,
transfectants were selected for 3 weeks in full medium
supplemented with 500 μg/ml G418 (Thermo Scientific),
and single clones were subcultivated for additional 4
weeks at 250 μg/ml G418. Clones were tested for the
presence of MTMR7 by RT-qPCR and Western blotting.
For insulin-mediated down-regulation of MTMR7
protein, 200.000 cells/well were seeded into a 6-well
plate. After 24 h (at ~30% confluency), growth factors
or other agents (rosi, H2O2) were added to the monolayer
in full medium. Alternatively, medium was replaced
to full medium with a final concentration of 20% (v/v)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Proliferation assay
Colorimetric cell viability assays were conducted
according to the manufacturer’s protocols (Roche
Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). In
brief, 500.000 cells/well were seeded into a 6-well
plate. The day after, cells were transfected for 6 h
before replacement to full medium and incubation
for additional 18 h. Cells were then trypsinized
and reseeded at a density of 2000 cells/well of 96well plates and grown for 1-7 days before adding
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) reagent and measurement of optical
density (OD) using a microplate reader (Infinite 200,
Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland).

Western blot
The method was performed essentially as detailed
elsewhere [36]. Cell monolayers were harvested by scraping
into lysis buffer (2% (w/v) SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4

supplemented with protease inhibitor [Minicomplete,
Roche], 1mM Na3VO4, 1mM DTT) followed by 3 x 3 sec
sonification (30% amplitude, Sonoplus HD 2070, Bandelin,
Berlin, Germany) and centrifugation in a bench-top
centrifuge (13.000 rpm, 10 min, 4°C). Supernatants were
subjected to colorimetric quantification (Pierce BCA protein
assay, Thermo Scientific) and stored at -20°C. SDS-PAGE
gels were loaded with equal amounts of protein per lane
(25 μg/lane) and transfer was visualized by Ponceau Red
staining of nitrocellulose membranes. Primary and secondary
peroxidase-coupled Abs (Amersham GE, Little Chalfont,
UK) were diluted as recommended by the manufacturers.
Chemoluminescence was detected using ECL (Amersham)
and quantified in an automated luminescence imaging device
(Fusion Solo, Peqlab VWR, Radnor, Pennsylvania).

sections were pretreated in citrate buffer for antigen
retrieval and incubated with hydrogen peroxide block and
Ultra V Block (both Thermo Scientific, Braunschweig,
Germany) to avoid unspecific reactions. IHC was
performed using polyclonal rabbit anti-MTMR7 Ab
(1:400, from Abcam). For visualization, the HistofineHRP-Universal-Antibody Polymer (Medac, Wedel,
Germany) and the 3,3'-diamino benzidine (DAB) substrate
kit (VectorLabs, Peterborough, UK) were applied (brown
color). Counterstaining was done with haematoxylin (Dr.
K. Hollborn Söhne GmbH Co KG; Leipzig, Germany).
The cytoplasmic staining was evaluated in the epithelial
compartment (TU and NC) and the stroma (lamina
propria) using a human smooth muscle biopsy as a positive
control for calibration of the staining on each slide. The
frequency and intensity of MTMR7 staining was assessed
in human custom-made (from CR) and commercial
(Co483, US Biomax, Rockville, MD) TMAs or in FFPE
resection material and biopsies on slides (provided by JM,
PK) using the following scores: 0+ = negative (0-25%
positive rate), 1+ = weak (25-50%), 2+ = moderate (5075%), 3+ = strong (75-100%). In addition, patient cases
were analysed for dichotome distribution of staining
positivity (0=negative vs. 1=positive). All analyses were
done rater-blinded on a standard bright-field microscope
using manual counting supported by Image J software
(imagej.nih.gov/ij).

MALDI-MS imaging of lipids
Cells were transiently transfected with EV or
MTMR7 plasmids for 48 h. Thereafter, cell monolayers
were harvested by trypsinization, centrifuged and stored
as pellets at -20°C. Lipid spectra were identified and
quantified as published [37]. In brief, frozen cell pellets
were cut into 10 μm sections using a Leica CM 1900
cryostat (Leica Biosystems, Nussloch, Germany) at
-15°C and thaw-mounted in duplicates onto indium tin
oxide-coated conductive glass slides (Bruker Daltonik
GmbH, Bremen, Germany). 4-phenyl-α-cyanocinnamic
acid amide (Ph-CCA-NH2) [5 mg/ml in acetone/water
(90:10, v/v)] was deposited onto the cryosections using
a matrix sprayer (SunChrom, Friedrichsdorf, Germany),
where air pressure was set to 2.5 bar. Matrix was
deposited in nine layers, with medium flow rate set to 10
μl/min (first layer); 15 μl/min (second); 20 μl/min (third)
and 25 μl/min (all others). The z-position was set to 25.3
mm. MALDI-TOF MS was performed on an Autoflex III
MALDI-TOF/TOF instrument (Bruker) equipped with a
smartbeam laser (200 Hz) and controlled by flexControl
3.0 software (Bruker). The instrument was set to an
acceleration voltage of 19 kV; spectra were acquired in
reflector negative ion mode with baseline subtraction in
the range from 400 to 1200 Da. Images were acquired
at a spatial resolution of 100 μm with 200 laser shots
per position by flexImaging 3.0 software (Bruker). The
MALDI-MS/MS analysis using the LIFT cell of the
Autoflex III instrument was conducted directly on the
cell pellet sections after MALDI IMS in which parent
ions were selected with a precursor ion selector window
of 1% of their mass. The MALDI Imaging data were
normalized to the total ion count and mass filters were
chosen with a width of 0.2 Da.

ELISA
The PI(3)P (#K-3300) and PI(3,4,5)P3 (#K-2500)
Mass ELISA Kits (both from Echelon Biosciences,
Salt Lake City, UT) were used as recommended by the
manufacturer. Acidic lipids were extracted from 5*106
cells. OD values from serial dilutions of lipids (pure, 1:2,
1:4 and 1:8) were measured using a microplate reader
(Infinite 200, Tecan) and calculated as pmol per 106 cells
from the standard curve using non-linear curve fitting
software (Graphpad Prism 4.0).

Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and
quantitative PCR (qPCR)
Extraction of total RNA from cells and frozen tissues
was carried out with peqGOLD Total RNA kit (VWR
International, Darmstadt, Germany), and PCR methods
were performed as published [36, 38]. Human MTMR7
cDNA (NM_004686.4) was amplified with primer pairs
against N-terminal (N-MTMR7 328-672), central/middle
(M-MTMR7 1087-1220) and C-terminal (C-MTMR7 20872217) regions of the CDS. Sequences of oligonucleotides
are listed in Supplementary Table S7. CT-values were
normalized to the house-keeping gene beta2-microglobulin
(B2M, B2m) and calculated as -fold induction using the
formulas of the relative quantification ΔΔCT-method
according to (https://lifescience.roche.com) [39].

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Antibody (Ab) and haematoxylin and eosin (HE)
stainings were done as described [35, 38]. In brief, tissue

Calculation of optical density (OD)

Abbreviations

Band intensities in gels from Western blots were
quantified using Image J software (imagej.nih.gov/ij).
OD values from proteins of interest were normalized
to OD values of the corresponding house-keeping
proteins (HSP90, beta-actin) or in case of phosphoepitopes to the unphosphorylated protein of interest.
These normalized OD ratios from MTMR7-transfected
cells were then substracted from the respective control
cells transfected with empty vector (EV) for each
time point or concentration. Statistical analysis was
then performed on these differences (D = MTMR7EV). OD values from colorimetric MTT assays were
first normalized by division through the starting value,
defined as 100% cell viability at day 1. Thereafter,
values from MTMR7-transfected cells were divided
through the respective EV-transfected control cells for
each time point or concentration. Statistical analysis
was then performed on these ratios (R = MTMR7/EV
vs. EV/EV).

Statistics and software
IHC data from patient tissue specimens were
analysed with SPSS version 20.0 (IBM Corporation,
Armonk, NY) as described [40, 41]. Univariate analyses
were done to detect differences between patient groups
using log-rank and Fisher exact tests regarding metabolic
factors, tumor-specific parameters and survival. Median
times and rates for survival were defined according to the
NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms (www.cancer.gov): OS
rate = percentage of people who are still alive for a certain
period of time (usually after a 5- or 10 year follow-up)
after they were diagnosed for CRC. TSS rate = percentage
of patients who have not died from the CRC in a defined
period of time. The time period begins at the time of
diagnosis and ends at the time of death. Patients who
died from causes other than CRC were excluded from the
measurement.
Quantitative results from cell experiments are
