BACKGROUND. During therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), approximately 20% to 50% of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) develop
grade 3 thrombocytopenia leading to treatment interruptions and dose reductions. Interleukin 11 (IL-11) reduces the incidence and the severity of thrombocytopenia in solid tumors.

METHODS. The authors investigated the efficacy and safety of low-dose IL-11 for
improving thrombocytopenia associated with TKI therapy in 14 patients with
CML. The starting dose of IL-11 was 10 lg/kg 3 times weekly, and the dose was

escalated by 1 dose level every 2 weeks if the patients had no sustained platelet
increase.

RESULTS. The median patient age was 52 years. The median platelet count at the
time IL-11 was started was 37 3 109/L. All patients had prior TKI dose reductions. After the initiation of IL-11, 8 of 14 patients (57%) had an increase in platelet count with a median peak platelet count of 110 3 109/L. One additional
patient had no platelet increase but was able to tolerate an imatinib dose
increase. Eleven patients had a decrease in the number of days of TKI therapy
interruption secondary to thrombocytopenia after the initiation of IL-11 (6% of
total treatment time vs 34% of total treatment time before IL-11). Therapy was
well tolerated.

CONCLUSIONS. The current results indicated that IL-11 may correct thrombocytopenia associated with TKI therapy for patients with CML and that it has a favorable toxicity profile. Cancer 2008;113:1338–43.  2008 American Cancer Society.

matinib mesylate is standard therapy for patients with chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML) and induced a complete cytogenetic
response in 50% to 60% of patients with CML who failed previous
therapy with interferon a and in up to 90% of patients who received
imatinib as frontline therapy.1,2 Second-generation tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs), such as dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, and INNO406, recently have demonstrated significant clinical efficacy in
patients who failed prior therapy with imatinib.3–6 Although imatinib and the second-generation TKIs are tolerated well overall, some
patients develop adverse events that complicate their management
and, in a few instances, lead to permanent treatment discontinuation. Among them, myelosuppression (anemia, neutropenia, or
thrombocytopenia) is the most common adverse event, and it
occurs to a different extent with all of these agents. These most fre-

quently are grade 1or 2 toxicities, but grade 3
thrombocytopenia (platelets <50 3 109/L) and neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <109/L) can
occur in 10% to 15% of patients who receive imatinib
as frontline therapy1 and in up to 50% of patients
who are treated with second-generation TKIs after
imatinib failure.3-6 The current guidelines for the
management of TKI-associated myelosuppression
recommend treatment interruption for grade 3 or 4
neutropenia or thrombocytopenia until platelets
recover to >50 3 109/L and neutrophils recover to
>1 3 109/L. Usually, if the recovery takes 2 weeks,
then treatment is restarted at the same dose that was
used when the event first occurred; if recovery takes
>2 weeks or if it is recurrent, then the dose usually
is reduced. Myelosuppression in patients with CML
has been associated with lower probability for
achieving a complete or major cytogenetic response,
possibly because of the treatment interruptions.7
To manage myelosuppression, hematopoietic
growth factors have been used. Erythropoietin or
darbepoetin have been used successfully to manage
anemia,8 and filgrastim has been used to manage
neutropenia.9,10 Interleukin 11 (IL-11) (oprelvekin) is
a pleiotropic cytokine that plays an important role in
hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic systems, with
participation in megakaryopoiesis, osteoclastogenesis, neurogenesis, and fertility in women. IL-11 has
been approved for the treatment of thrombocytopenia associated with cancer therapy.11-13 It has been
demonstrated that prolonged administration of lowdose IL-11 is safe and effective in the management
of thrombocytopenia associated with aplastic anemia
and myelodysplastic syndromes,14,15 and an initial
observation suggested a potential role in the management of patients with CML who had imatinibassociated thromboctyopenia.16 Here, we report the
results from a pilot trial that further explored the use
of IL-11 in the management of TKI-associated
thrombocytopenia among patients with CML.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between October 2005 and November 2006, 14
patients with CML in chronic or accelerated phase
who were receiving treatment with imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, or bosutinib and who had thrombocytopenia that occurred during the course of therapy
with TKI were included in this study. To be eligible,
patients had to have grade 3 thrombocytopenia (ie,
platelets <50 3 109/L) after at least 4 weeks of therapy with TKI that was either recurrent or required a
dose reduction of the TKI. Patients were excluded
from the study if they had 1) a known allergy to

1339

Escherichia coli, 2) hypersensitivity to IL-11 or any
component of IL-11, 3) New York Heart Association
Class III or IV heart failure, 4) thrombocytopenia
considered to be unrelated to TKI therapy, 5) stem
cell transplantation within 60 days, 6) a history of
atrial arrhythmia, or 7) pregnancy or papilledema. All
patients signed an informed consent document that
was approved by the Institutional Review Board.
All patients had a complete blood count before
starting IL-11 therapy, every week until they achieved
a stable platelet count (>60 3 109/L), and then every
2 to 6 weeks while they were on IL-11. Patients were
followed for the response to TKI with bone marrow
aspirations, cytogenetic analysis, and peripheral
blood polymerases chain reaction analysis every 3 to
6 months.

Treatment
The starting dose of IL-11 was 10 lg/kg subcutaneously 3 times weekly. The IL-11 dose could be
escalated every 2 to 4 weeks to 10 lg/kg 5 times
weekly and, subsequently, to 10 lg/kg daily if there
was not a sustained platelet increase of at least 10 3
109/L above the baseline or to allow a TKI dose
increase if clinically indicated, provided there was no
grade 3 or 4 toxicity related to IL-11. The dose of IL11 also could be reduced in case of grade 3 or 4 toxicity to 5 lg/kg. Patients who had a response to therapy could have their IL-11 dose reduced by 1 dose
level to 5 lg/kg 3 times weekly every 2 to 4 weeks to
maintain platelet counts that would allow uninterrupted TKI therapy. Patients could continue to
receive IL-11 as long as they continued on TKI provided there was continued benefit without grade 3 or
4 toxicity. Patients with no response after 3 months
on therapy despite dose escalation were considered
to have failure to therapy and were taken off study.
Response Definitions
For the purposes of this study, platelet response was
defined as follows: A complete response (CR) was
defined as a sustained (3 months) platelet count
60 3 109/L while continuing TKI therapy or sustained (3 months) re-escalation of TKI dose to the
prethrombocytopenia level without recurrence of
thrombocytopenia. Two endpoints were monitored:
the leukemia failure rate and the platelet response
rate. The response definitions for CML were reported
previously.17

RESULTS
Fourteen patients were enrolled in the study. Their
clinical characteristics are shown in Table 1. The

median patient age was 52 years (range, 34-77 years).
Twelve patients were in chronic phase, and 2
patients were in accelerated phase at the time TKI
was started. At the time IL-11 was initiated, 9
patients were receiving imatinib, 3 patients were
receiving dasatinib, and 2 patients were receiving
nilotinib. All patients had required TKI dose reductions and/or treatment interruptions because of
thrombocytopenia before they started IL-11 (Table 2).
After a median duration of IL-11 therapy of 7
months (range, 1-16 months), 9 patients (64%)
achieved a CR as defined above. Seven of the
responding patients met the CR criteria by having an
increased platelet count, 1 patient met the CR criteria by having a TKI dose escalation, and 1 patient
had both an increased platelet count and an
increased TKI dose. The median duration of response
to IL-11 was 9 months (range, 2.5-40 months). The
median increment in platelet count from baseline
was 67 3 109/L (range, 29-165 3 109/L), and the median peak platelet count was 110 3 109/L (range, 66200 3 109/L) (Figs. 1 and 2). Next, we calculated the
time patients had been off TKI therapy because of
thrombocytopenia as a proportion of the total time
patients had been on TKI therapy. Eleven patients
had a decrease in the number of days of TKI therapy
interruption secondary to thrombocytopenia after
the initiation of IL-11. The median time off TKI as a
percentage of the total time on TKI for these 11

patients was 6% (range, 0%-17%) after the initiation
of IL-11 compared with 34% (range, 7%-65%) before
the initiation of IL-11. The cytogenetic response to
TKI improved in 7 patients, including 3 patients who
achieved a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR)
and 1 patient who achieved a partial cytogenetic
response after the initiation of IL-11. In addition, 1
patient already in CCyR had an improvement in molecular response (the BCR-ABL/ABL ratio decreased
from 0.39% to 0.19%) during IL-11 therapy (Table 2).
Platelet responses were durable, and the median
duration of CR was 13 months (range, 3-40 months)
from the start of IL-11. Two of these responding
patients eventually discontinued therapy with IL-11
and maintained their response for 16 months and 32
months, respectively, after discontinuing IL-11. One
patient experienced a recurrence of thrombocytopenia after 4 months despite continuation of IL-11.
The median highest dose of IL-11 received by all
patients was 10 lg/kg 5 times weekly (range, from 10
lg/kg 3 times weekly to 10 lg/kg 7 times weekly).
Nine patients had IL-11 dose escalation to achieve or
maintain response to therapy, including 6 patients
who increased to 10 lg/kg 5 times weekly and 3
patients who increased to 10 lg/kg 7 times weekly.
Six patients discontinued IL-11 therapy because they
had no response (n 5 2 patients; after 5 weeks and
9 weeks of therapy), because they had a sustained
platelet response without IL-11 (n 5 2 patients),
because of noncompliance (n 5 1 patient), and
because of fatigue (n 5 1 patient). IL-11 was tolerated well overall. Grade 1 or 2 peripheral edema was
the most common adverse event observed in 6
patients (43%) and was manageable with diuretics in
all but 1 patient who had grade 2 edema and
required an IL-11 dose reduction. One patient developed grade 1 blurry vision, and 1 patient developed
a grade 1 rash. The only grade >3 toxicity was grade
4 fatigue, possibly related to IL-11, in 1 patient, leading to discontinuation of therapy. No other adverse
events related to IL-11 were observed.

DISCUSSION
Thrombocytopenia is a relatively common adverse
event observed among patients with CML treated
with TKI. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia ranges from 9% among patients who receive
imatinib as frontline therapy,1 to 22% among patients
who receive imatinib after interferon failure,2 to 29%
among patients who receive nilotinib after imatinib
failure, and to 47% among patients who receive dasatinib after imatinib failure. Although most of these
episodes are transient and occur predominantly dur-

One patient had no improvement in platelet count, but was able to tolerate

ing the first 2 to 3 months of therapy, in some
patients, thrombocytopenia is persistent or recurrent
and may require TKI dose reductions and/or treatment interruptions. Patients with significant myelosuppression may have a lower probability of
responding to TKIs.7 In 1 report of 143 patients who
received imatinib after failure on interferon, among
31 patients who developed grade 3 thrombocytopenia, 11 patients (35%) achieved a CCyR compared
with 66 of 112 patients (59%) who did not develop
thrombocytopenia.7 A similar adverse outcome was
observed for those who developed grade 3 neutrope-

nia. Patients who had myelosuppression that lasted
>2 weeks had a particularly poor outcome. Thus,
approaches that could help manage thrombocytopenia would be desirable. IL-11 is a hematopoietic
growth factor in which the primary hematopoietic
activity is stimulation of megakaryocytopoiesis and
thrombopoiesis, leading to increases in the platelet
production in vivo with a time course similar to that
of thrombopoietin.18 The thrombopoietic action of
IL-11 is not mediated through thrombopoietin
release or synergism and is independent of the
thrombopoietin receptor.19 Several clinical trails have

an increase in TKI dose.

reported the efficacy of recombinant IL-11 in cancer
patients with thrombocytopenia.11,13,20 Isaacs et al
reported on 77 patients with advanced breast cancer
who were receiving chemotherapy and were randomized to receive placebo or IL-11 50 lg/kg subcutaneously daily for 10 days or 17 days after 2 cycles of
chemotherapy. In that study, platelet transfusions
were required in 32% of patients who received IL-11
compared with 59% of patients who received placebo.20 Fluid retention was the most common
adverse event: Sixty-three percent of patients developed peripheral edema, 48% developed dyspnea, and
18% developed pleural effusions.20 On the basis of
those results, IL-11 was approved for the management of chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia.
The standard dose of IL-11 is 50 lg/kg given subcutaneously every day for 14 to 21 days or until the platelet count reaches 50 3 109/L.21 However, this
dose has been associated with significant toxicity
when used in the management of thrombocytopenia
in patients with bone marrow failure disorders
(aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome).22
To overcome this, Kurzrock et al investigated the use
of a low-dose IL-11 in patients with bone marrow
failure disorders. In that study, 33 patients with
thrombocytopenia associated with myelodysplastic
syndromes, aplastic anemia, or stem cell transplantation received IL-11 10 lg/kg daily for 2 weeks followed by a 2-week rest.14 Nine patients (27%)
responded with a median increment in platelet count
of 111 3 109/L. Treatment was tolerated well, and
grade 1 or 2 edema occurred in 42% of patients.
Grade 3 adverse events included 1 episode each of
transient ischemic attack and atrial fibrillation/
supraventricular tachycardia.14
We previously reported on the potential benefit
of IL-11 in 3 patients with CML who had thrombocytopenia associated with imatinib therapy.16 Now, we
report on an expanded experience in which 9 of 14
patients who received low-dose IL-11 responded with
a platelet increase and/or an increase in the dose of
TKI. All patients had required frequent treatment
interruptions and/or dose reductions because of
thrombocytopenia; and, after they received IL-11, the
responders were able to remain on uninterrupted
TKI for a longer time. Two concerns about the use of
IL-11 in this setting are the toxicity and the possibility of worsening outcome of the leukemia. Regarding
the toxicity, treatment at these lower doses of IL-11
was tolerated well, in agreement with previous
reports.14,15 Edema was the most common adverse
event, but this typically was modest and manageable.
The possibility that hematopoietic growth factors
may stimulate the growth of leukemic progenitors

and, thus, may worsen the outcome of patients who
receive these agents has been a concern. In fact, IL11 currently is indicated for the prevention of severe
thrombocytopenia and the reduction of the need for
platelet transfusions after myelosuppressive chemotherapy in adult patients with nonmyeloid malignancies who are at risk for severe thrombocytopenia. In
the current study, most patients actually improved
their response to TKI during IL-11 therapy. This
probably reflects the finding that they were more
likely to continue on TKI therapy uninterrupted.
In conclusion, IL-11 may improve the thrombocytopenia associated with TKI therapy in patients
with CML. Low-dose IL-11 (10 lg/kg 3-5 times per
week) can be administered with minimal toxicity and
with no evidence of worsening of CML response to
TKI. Further studies of IL-11 or other thromobpoietic
agents are warranted to confirm these observations.
