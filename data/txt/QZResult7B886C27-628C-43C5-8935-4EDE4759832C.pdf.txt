Abstract
Aneuploidy, the unbalanced number of chromosomes in a cell, is considered
a prevalent form of genetic instability and is largely acknowledged as a condition
implicated in tumorigenesis. Epigenetic alterations like DNA hypomethylation have
been correlated with cancer initiation/progression. Furthermore, a growing body of
evidence suggests the involvement of epigenome-wide disruption as a cause of global
DNA hypomethylation in aneuploidy generation.
Here, we report that the DNA hypomethylating drug 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine
(DAC), affects the correct ploidy of nearly diploid HCT-116 human cells by altering
the methylation pattern of the chromosomes. Specifically, we show that a DACinduced reduction of 5-Methyl Cytosine at the pericentromeric region of chromosomes
correlates with aneuploidy and mitotic defects.
Our results suggest that DNA hypomethylation leads to aneuploidy by altering
the DNA methylation landscape at the centromere that is necessary to ensure proper
chromosomes segregation by recruiting the proteins necessary to build up a functional
kinetochore.

Introduction

reported that severe hypomethylation correlates with
increased malignancy [13]. However, little is known
about the mechanism(s) by which most of human cancers
become aneuploid following DNA hypomethylation. DNA
hypomethylation can result in different phenotypic effects
depending on the cell genotype. Previously, we reported
that DNA Methyl-Transferase 1 (DNMT1) depletion
caused cell cycle arrest in IMR90 cells and aneuploidy
in HCT-116 colon cancer cells missing p14ARF function
in association with global DNA hypomethylation
[14]. Loss of DNMTs function leads to global genome
hypomethylation and to chromosomal instability in
mouse models [15] and human ICF syndrome [16, 17].
Specifically, cells from patients with ICF syndrome exhibit
hypomethylation of pericentromeric regions associated
with the formation of micronuclei [18].
Two different hypotheses, not mutually exclusive,
have been formulated to explain the correlation
between DNA hypomethylation and aneuploidy.

The majority of human tumours show a form
of genome instability called chromosomal instability
(CIN) that refers to the high rate of numerical and
structural chromosome aberrations found in cancer cells.
Numerical CIN is characterised by gain and loss of
whole chromosomes resulting in aneuploidy, a harmful
condition for the viability of cells and organisms.
At the molecular level, aneuploidy arises by several
mechanism(s) including mutations in genes encoding
mitotic regulators [1, 2], tumour suppressors or controlling
centrosome numbers [3-7], altered expression of mitotic
checkpoint proteins, defects in chromatid cohesion and in
kinetochore-microtubule attachment [6-10]. Furthermore,
epigenetic alterations such as DNA hypomethylation
are considered as a cause of aneuploidy [11, 12]. Global
genome hypomethylation has been described in breast,
ovarian, cervical and brain tumours and it has been

DNA hypomethylation could alter the expression of
genes coding for specific mitotic checkpoint proteins.
Alternatively modifications of chromosomal DNA
methylation pattern could also interfere with the correct
structure of chromosomes [12]. In this regard, it has
been reported that an epigenetic, sequence-independent
mechanism underlies the formation of the centromere
[19, 20]. Indeed, the epigenetic environment onto and
around the centromere is very important to ensure proper
chromosome segregation. In all species studied, the
centromere is defined by a specific chromatin domain
containing a H3 histone variant (CENP-A), flanked
by a large pericentromeric heterochromatin domain
CENP-A free and enriched in highly repetitive α-satellite
sequences. Although repetitive DNA sequences are not
essential for centromere formation, they provide the
necessary environment to assemble the centromere [21
22] and the disruption of pericentromeric heterochromatin
conformation leads to chromosome segregation defects,
generally associated with the loss of cohesins into and
around this domain [20, 23, 24].
The decrease of pericentromeric methylation in
human lymphocytes treated with the 5-Azacytidine (AZA)
inducing loss of DNA methylation was associated with
missegregation of chromosomes 1 and 16 [25]. Given that
these two chromosomes have highly methylated satellite
2 regions this observation suggests a relationship between
loss of DNA methylation and chromosomes loss.
To investigate the role of global DNA
hypomethylation on chromosome structure and
segregation and to clarify the relationship between DNA
hypomethylation and generation of aneuploidy, we treated
HCT-116 cells, a nearly diploid human cell line with
5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (DAC, also known as decitabine),
to induce DNA hypomethylation [26]. After cellular
uptake and phosphorylations, the cytidine analogue AZA
is incorporated into both DNA and RNA with effects
on the processing of tRNA and thereby interfering with
protein translation. On the contrary, DAC is incorporated
into DNA and causes more efficient inhibition of DNA
methyltransferases [27]. DAC acts through the formation
of covalent DNMT1-DAC-DNA adducts leading to
a decrease in DNMT1 levels and CpG dinucleotides
hypomethylation [28]. This in turn causes changes in the
genome methylation pattern to be transmitted to daughter
cells.
Here, we report that the DNA hypomethylating drug
5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (DAC), affects the correct ploidy
of nearly diploid HCT-116 human cells by altering the
methylation pattern of the chromosomes. Specifically, we
show that a DAC-induced reduction of 5-Methyl Cytosine
at the pericentromeric region of chromosomes correlates
with aneuploidy and mitotic defects

Low doses of DAC induce DNA hypomethylation
and aneuploidy
DNA methylation occurs onto cytosine located in the
so-called CpG islands thanks to DNA methyl-transferases.
DNA methylation strongly influences chromatin structure
and generally leads to a higher degree of compaction thus
repressing gene expression. In order to study the effects of
DNA hypomethylation on chromosome dynamics, we first
assessed at which concentration DAC was able to induce
DNA hypomethylation without affecting cell viability and
cell proliferation. HCT-116 cells were treated with DAC at
different doses and the effects of exposure were evaluated
over a period of 72 hours. Cells treated with 2 µM and
5µM of DAC did not show reduction of cell viability
(Figure 1A). In addition the acridine orange assay showed
that HCT116 cells after DAC treatment did not undergo
apoptosis or necrosis (Figure 1B). On the contrary,
DAC at a concentration of 10 µM severely impaired
cell viability (Figure 1A). Next, we assessed the level of
5-methylcytosine (5mC) in HCT-116 cells after the DAC
treatment. Fluorescence microscopy and Slot-blot analysis
showed a progressive and intensive reduction of the 5-mC
signal throughout 72 hours of treatment with a decrease of
50%, 60% and 80% after 24, 48 and 72 hours, respectively
(Figure 2A, 2B; Figure S1). This result is in accordance
with the DAC mechanism affecting DNA methylation
level via CpG dinucleotides hypomethylation [28] that in
turn causes changes in the genome methylation pattern of
daughter cells. To determine if loss of methylation upon
DAC treatment occurred also at specific hypermethylated
promoter we evaluated the promoter methylation status
of the CHFR gene that is hypermethylated in HCT-116
cells [29]. The methylation status of the CHFR promoter
was assessed by Methylation Specific PCR (MSP) in
HCT-116 cells treated with DAC (1, 2, 5μM) for 72 hours.
DAC treatment induced loss of DNA methylation of the
CHFR gene promoter as revealed by the presence of an
amplicon obtained with specific primers annealing with
the unmethylated DNA (Figure 2C). The methylation loss
of CHFR promoter was confirmed by the re-expression
of CHFR assessed by RT-PCR and Western Blot (Figure
2D, 2E).
As loss of DNA methylation could interfere with
chromosome dynamics, we evaluated if the global DNA
hypomethylation observed upon the DAC treatment was
associated with aneuploidy. We scored the number of
chromosomes/cell by fluorescent microscopy in HCT-116
cells treated for 72 hours with 5µM DAC. This analysis
showed a significant alteration in the distribution of the
number of chromosomes per cell after treatment with
DAC when compared to the control. Specifically, after

24 hours of treatment we observed a 30% reduction
in the number of cells with 45 chromosomes and
concurrently a significant increase in aneuploid cells with
a clear trend to hypodiploidy. Additionally, it was also
observed a significant increase of hypodiploid cells (<39
chromosomes per cell) at 48 and 72 hours, ranging from
15% to 25 % respectively (Figure 3).

immunofluorescence microscopy to establish whether
these changes could account for the mitotic segregation
defects described. After 24 hours of DAC treatment,
we did not observe a different 5-mC-FITC labelling of
chromosomes in respect to untreated cells. However,
after 48 hours chromosomes appeared asymmetrically
labelled with one chromatid of each chromosome
unlabelled (Figure 4). Moreover, pericentromeric regions
appeared faintly labelled or not labelled at all (Figure
4B, e). The asymmetric methylation of sister chromatids
is in agreement with data shown in Figure 2A and is
indicative of loss of DNA methylation occurring after
two subsequent cell cycles in presence of DAC. To relate
the observed chromosome methylation pattern to the
number of cell divisions that HCT116 cells underwent
in the presence of DAC we determined cell proliferation
timing by allowing cells to incorporate the halogenated
thymidine analog 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into
DNA. Subsequently, by bivariate DNA-BrdU (propidium

Recently, it has been proposed a relationship
between loss of DNA methylation and chromosome
segregation defects through the disruption of
pericentromeric heterochromatin configuration [20, 23]
[24, 25]. Given the increase in the number of aneuploid
cells upon DAC treatment, we aimed to evaluate the
changes in the methylation pattern of chromosomes by

iodide (PI) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)) flow
cytometry we analysed the presence of the BrdU-labeled
cells during the cell cycle. The nuclei stained with PI,
which fluoresces red at an intensity reflecting the DNA
content, define a reference for G1 and G2/M cells. The
cytofluorimetric profiles of HCT16 cells treated with DAC
or left untreated were similar and suggest that HCT116
DAC treated cells duplicate in about 24 hours (Figure S2).
We gained additional evidence that DAC treated
HCT116 cells have undergone two cell cycles using
the Fluorescence plus Giemsa (FPG) technique to stain
chromosomes. The FPG method is generally used to
visualize sister chromatid exchanges in cells grown for
two cell cycles in BrdUrd [30]. Based on semiconservative
DNA replication, both chromatids of a chromosome will

have incorporated BrdU into either one or both of their
strands at the end of two cycles. After staining with
the DNA-binding fluorochrome Hoechst 33258, UV
photolysis, and Giemsa staining, the doubly substituted
chromatids (new strands) appear light and the sister
chromatids (parental strands) appear dark when observed
by transmitted light microscopy (Figure S2B).
All together these findings confirm that the presence
of asymmetrically methylated sister chromatids (Figure4)
is explained by the semiconservative DNA replication
coupled with the passive loss of CpG dinucleotide
methylation caused by DAC exposure (48h).
In the attempt to understand how the induced
DNA hypomethylation triggered aneuploidy, we looked
at the morphology of chromosomes. In addition to

chromosomal aberrations such as chromatid breaks/gaps,
chromatid exchanges and chromosome pulverization
(Figure S3, S4), we found “railroad track” chromosomes
(RR) characterised by the absence of a clear centromere
in 15% of mitosis analised. RR chromosomes coexisted

with normal chromosomes in the same metaphase spread
(Figure 5). Chromosomes in mitosis were DAPI stained

method (Figure 5B).

week, 10 days and 2 weeks from the beginning of the
treatment. Seventy-two hours post-treatment cells
showed aneuploidy and in particular 23% of aneuploidy
cells were hypodiploid in which only few chromosomes
were missing. This percentage increased up to 40% and
remained stable up to two 2 weeks of treatment (Figure
7A). The prolonged treatment with 2µM of DAC also
induced RR chromosomes (Figure 7B; Figure S5). These
aberrant chromosomes were mainly evident after one
week of treatment when the about 70% of metaphases
showed at least a couple of RR chromosomes in which the
centromere appeared less Giemsa stained. Taken together
these experiments showed that DNA hypomethylation
caused by DAC treatments induced in addition to
aneuploidy, alteration of chromosome methylation pattern
and of cell division. To establish whether the effects of
the DAC treatment were reversible, cells exposed to 2µM
DAC for one week were released in DAC-free medium for

We addressed then the question if an extended DAC
treatment, up to 2 weeks, at lower doses than 5µM could
have a different impact on cell viability and ploidy. Cells
were then treated with 2µM DAC and counted every
24 hours to estimate the proliferation rate that resulted
slightly delayed in respect to untreated cells (Figure 6A).
In addition, the cellular ploidy was assessed after one week
of treatment by using the ‘modfit’ software that estimates
the ploidy of the cells after FACS analysis by measuring
the DNA content (Propidium Iodide fluorescence). The
results indicated the presence of an elevated percentage
of aneuploid cells (50%) in these treated cells (Figure 6C).
We determined then the effects of 2µM DAC
treatment on aneuploidy generation at different times
by evaluating chromosome numbers at 72 hours, 1

observed a decrease in the number of aneuploid cells as
well as of RR chromosomes suggesting that the effect of
the DAC were partially reversible (Figure 7C).

DAC-treated HCT-116 cells expressing H2B-GFP [31] to
detect mitotic abnormalities from which aneuploidy could
arise. At 24 and 48 hours after DAC treatment (5µM),
we observed increased mitotic defects and chromosome
alterations like: chromosome bridge, lagging chromosome,
micronuclei and chromosome out of the spindle. (Figure 8
and S4, Table 1). We noticed a strong increase (>40%) of
these mitotic alterations at 48 hours from DAC treatment
in agreement with the observed aneuploidy (Figure 3). The
delay from prometaphase to anaphase progression was
likely caused by the presence of these defects (Figure 8B).

Aneuploidy triggered by hypomethylation is
associated with mitotic defects
We investigated if the altered methylation pattern of
chromosomes correlated with chromosomes segregation
defects. To this purpose, we performed live-imaging of

can result in kinetochore dysfunction so losing the
connection between chromosomes and the mitotic spindle
an event known to cause chromosome missegregation
and aneuploidy [33]. Imbalance in cytosine methylation
(hypomethylation) and deregulation of DNA methyltransferases, are recurrent in human sporadic cancers
and it was reported that they could be involved in the
acquisition of chromosomal instability [34]. In a recent
work, we demonstrated that DNA hypomethylation
caused by DNMT1 post-transcriptional silencing induced
aneuploidy in cells lacking p14ARF [14]. Here, we treated
cells with low doses of DAC (2µM and 5 µM) in order
to induce DNA hypomethylation without interfering with
cell viability and we determined that DAC induces loss of
DNA methylation at the centromere/pericentromere region
resulting in mitotic defects (i.e. lagging chromosomes and
micronuclei) that in turn underlie aneuploidy as suggested
by the increase number of aneuploidy cells that raised
up to 25-30% after DAC treatment. DAC acts through
the formation of covalent adducts DNMT1-DAC-DNA
leading to two consequences: the decrease of DNMT1
into the cell and CpG hypomethylation [28]. Cells exposed

Discussion
Epigenetic marks combine to bring about
DNA hypercondensation typical of centromeric and
pericentromeric heterochromatin [32, 20, 22]. The
maintenance of the epigenetic memory at these regions
is believed to be essential for a functional centromere.
Thus, loss of DNA methylation altering this configuration

to this drug for either a short (72 hours) or a long (1-2
weeks) period of time became aneuploid. This condition
was alleviated when cells were released in drug-free
medium for additional two weeks. The decrease in DNA
methylation was assessed by slot blot assay that evaluates
the global degree of DNA methylation and by Methylation
Specific PCR. Both strategies confirmed that low doses of
DAC induce not only a global reduction in 5mC levels,
but also the specific methylation loss of the CHFR gene
promoter. Interestingly, the reduction in global DNA
methylation was associated with a significant change of
the 5mC pattern along mitotic chromosomes in that the
presence of 5mC was detected in only one of the two sister
chromatids after 48 hours of DAC treatment. This finding
is in agreement with the semiconservative replication of
the DNA in that after two cell divisions, one chromatid
is originated by the unmethylated DNA strands resulting
from the passive loss of DNA methylation induced by
DAC. The other chromatid, instead, retains the original
methylated strand. Our results also confirmed the HCT116
cell cycle duration of about 24 hours.
We hypothesize that DNA hypomethylation is
directly responsible for the aneuploidy we observed.
Our working model is supported by our time-lapse
video-microscopy where we observed several mitotic
alterations: mitotic delay, lagging chromosomes and
micronuclei generation, all of them recognized as a cause
of aneuploidy.
Moreover, we observed the RR chromosomes
that are characterized by the lack of the centromere and
appear as two single chromatids close to each other.
These RR chromosomes are not a consequence of
premature separation of the sister chromatids since not
all the chromatids in a metaphase appeared separated.
Instead they appear to be the consequence of the loss of
DNA methylation at the pericentromeric region of these
chromosomes that affects the centromere organization.
Although we cannot exclude that DNA
hypomethylation might also affect genes involved in
chromosome dynamics leading to destabilization of
chromosome cohesion and segregation, our results
suggest that the altered DNA methylation pattern could
compromise the functionality of the centromere and
consequently the correct chromosome segregation.
Finally, our results point at DNA hypomethylation
as a novel mechanism underlying aneuploidy and further
studies should be aimed to evaluate the integrity and
functionality of centromeres and kinetochores in cells
undergoing DNA methylation loss.

formamide/2X SSC (v/v) at 70°C for 5 min. The slides
were then dehydrated in a series of 70, 80 and 100%
cold ethanol and air dried. Samples were incubated
in a blocking solution (3% bovine serum albumin,
0.1% Tween-20/PBS) in coplin-jar for 1 hour. An anti5-methylcytosine (5-mC) mouse monoclonal antibody
(cloneD33, Epigentek, USA) was diluted 1:100 in 1%
Tween-20/PBS,) and was added to the cells for 1 hour at
37°C in a humidified chamber. The slides were washed
with 0.05% Tween-20/PBS, 3 times for 10 min and
incubated with FITC conjugated anti-mouse secondary
antibody (diluted 1:1000 in 1% Tween-20/PBS) for 1
hour at 37°C in a humidified chamber. Finally, cells were
washed with 0.05% Tween-20/PBS 3 times 10 min each
and nuclei were stained with 1µg/mL of DAPI. Fluorescent
images of prophase nuclei were acquired using the Zeiss
Axioskop microscope equipped for fluorescence. To
estimate the fluorescent signal of each nucleus images
were processed using the ImageJ software. The intensity
of the 5-mC signal was calculated as integrated density
and processed using the statistical software OriginPro
8.5.1 (OriginLab Corporation) as corrected total cell
fluorescence (CTCF) according to the following formula:
CTCF = Integrated Density − (Area of selected cell ×
Mean fluorescence of background readings). The final
value was normalized with DAPI signal. The same slides
were used to evaluate the 5mC methylation pattern of
metaphase chromosomes. For each condition tested,
chromosomes of 50 metaphases were scanned along their
longitudinal axis by using the RGB profile plot plugin of
ImageJ that provided, for every rectangular selection, a
two-dimensional graph of the intensities of pixels along
a line and a plot list of the data, in which were reported
the values of pixel intensity for each channel (blue, DAPI;
green, 5-mC signal). That data were then processed with
Origin-Pro 8.5.1 (OriginLab corporation) and graphed in
two different colour lines for each fluorescent channel,
where the x-axis represents the horizontal distance in
microns through the chromosome and the y-axis the
vertically averaged pixel intensity.

Cytogenetics analysis
Cells were treated with 0.2μg/mL of colcemid
(Demecolcine, SIGMA-Aldrich, Italy) for two hours,
trypsinized and harvested by centrifugation at 1000
rpm for 10 min. Cells were swollen by adding 75mM
KCl dropwise and incubated at 37°C for 10 min, then
centrifugated at 800 rpm for 10 min. The pellet was
resuspended adding dropwise 5 mL of cold Carnoy’s
fixative [methanol/acetic acid (3:1 v/v)] and incubated
for 15 min on ice. After repeating the last step twice,
cells were dropped onto iced slides. Chromosomes were
stained either with Giemsa or with 1µg/mL of DAPI
(4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, SIGMA-Aldrich, Italy)
and examined on a Zeiss Axioskop microscope equipped
for fluorescence, images were captured with a CCD digital
camera (AxioCam, Zeiss) and then transferred to Adobe
PhotoShop. We evaluated at least 100 mitoses for each
sample. The experiment was repeated twice.

Slot blot analysis

DNA and the following reagents mix: 1x Buffer, 0,2 µM
dNTP mix, 1,5 mM MgCl2, 0,5 µM Primer for, 0,5 µM
Primer rev, 1,5U/µl Taq (Applied Biosystems, Thermo
Fisher Scientific) PCR reaction consisted of a step at 95°C
for 10min before of 45 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 58°C for
1min, 72°C for 1 min (MCHFR); 94°C for 1 min, 50°C
for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min (UCHFR), followed by a final
step at 72°C for 4 min. The resultant PCR products were
resolved on a 1,8% agarose gel.

The DNA-slot blot analysis of 5-mC was performed
as described in [36] with the following modifications. Nonmethylated DNA of Escherichia coli ET12567/pUZ8002
[37] was used as negative control and methylated DNA
of Escherichia coli Yale BW25113 [38] as positive
control. Total genomic DNA was purified and 100 μg/25
μL from each sample were denatured at 100°C for 5
min and applied onto Hybond-N membrane (RPN203N,
Amersham Biosciences) using the Hybrislot Manifold
Apparatus (Whatman Biometra, Germany) under vacuum
for 3 min. DNA was fixed to the membrane by exposing
to UV light (70,000 μ joules/cm2) for 45 seconds using
the Hoefer UVC 50 Crosslinker (Amersham Biosciences).
The membrane was then incubated in 5% w/v no-fat dry
milk prepared in TBST buffer (Tris Buffered Saline 0.05%
Tween-20), for 1 hour at RT. This step was then followed
by incubation with anti- 5-Methylcytosine Monoclonal
Antibody (1:500, cloneD33, Epigentek, USA) for 1 hour
at RT. The membrane was then washed 3 times with
TBST for 10 min and incubated with an anti-mouse HRP
conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:2000 (Abcam,
UK) for 1 hour at RT. After extensive washes in TBST
(3 washes of 10 min each) the membrane was washed
once in double distilled water and developed by enhanced
chemiluminescence detection reagents (Pierce, Thermo
Scientific). Images were acquired with the Chemidoc
XSR Imaging System (BioRad). The amount of spotted
DNA was detected by staining the membrane with 0.02%
w/v methylene blue in 0.3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2).
Subsequently, washing in double distilled water was
necessary to reduce the background noise. The relative
5-mC optical density (OD) value was calculated with
Quantity One 4.6.7 software (BioRad) and the amount of
DNA was normalised against the wild type control.

Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR)
Primers to be used in real time RT-PCR experiments
were designed with Primer Express software (Applied
Biosystems, Life Technologies) choosing amplicons of
approximately 70-100 bp. The selected sequences were
tested against public databases (BLAST) to confirm
the identity of the genes. Total RNA was extracted
from cells by using the “PureLink RNA mini kit ”
(Ambion, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the
manufacture’s instruction. RNA was reverse-transcribed
in a final volume of 20μL using the High Capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems,
Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 10 minutes at 25°C and
2 hours at 37°C. For each sample 50ng of cDNA, was
analyzed by RT-PCR (95°C for 15 sec, 60°C for 60 sec
repeated for 40 cycles). RT-PCR was done in a final
volume of 20μl comprising 1x Master Mix SYBR Green
(Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and
0,3 μM of forward and reverse primers for: GAPDH
(Fw: 5’-CTCATG ACCACAGTCCATGCC-3’, Rev:
5’-GCCATCCACA GTCTTCTGGGT-3’), CHFR (Fw:
5’-CCTCAACAACCTCGTGGAAGCATAC -3’, Rev:
5’-TCCTGGCATCCATACTTTGCACAT -3’).

Western blotting

Methylation specific PCR (MSP)

Protein concentration was measured using the
Bio-RadProtein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Proteins
(40 μg) were separated by 4-12% Bolt bis-tris plus gels
(Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and transferred
to Hybond-C nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham
Life Science) by electroblotting. The membranes were
sequentially incubated with primary antibodies against
CHFR (goat, Santa Cruz, 1:100), β-tubulin (mouse,
SIGMA, 1:5000) and HRP-conjugated mouse (Pierce
Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:5000) or goat (ab97110,
Abcam, 1:2000) as secondary antibodies. The target
protein was detected with enhanced chemiluminescence
Western blotting detection reagents (Pierce, Thermo Fisher
Scientific).

Genomic DNA was extracted from DAC treated
HCT-116 cells (1, 2 and 5µM) by using the All-Prep DNA/
RNA kit (Qiagen S.r.l.- Italy). 2µg of DNA in a volume
of 20µl were converted by Epitect Bisulfite kit (Qiagen
S.r.l.- Italy). Methylation-specific PCR amplification was
carried out using oligonucleotide primers which were
designed to anneal specifically to either methylated or
unmethylated DNA after sodium bisulfite conversion as
described above. The oligonucleotides used in this study
were the following: Methylated DNA-specific primers
were MCHFR-forward (5’-ATATAATATGGCGTCGATC)
and MCHFR reverse (5’-TCAACTAATCCGCGAAACG).
Unmethylated DNA-specific primers were UCHFRforward (5’-ATATAATATGGTGTTGATT) and UCHFR
reverse (5’-TCAACTAATCCACAAAACA) [39]
The PCR reaction was performed using 100ng of

Live imaging of cell division by time lapse videomicroscopy
HCT-116 cells expressing H2B-GFP were seeded
in 25 cm2 flasks and treated with DAC as reported above
and cultured in 6 mL of complete DMEM medium
(Gibco) 24 h before Time-Lapse analysis, the medium
was replaced with supplemented HEPES no phenol red
DMEM (Gibco, Life Technology, Italy). Fluorescent and
phase contrast images were automatically acquired every
10-60 sec over a period of 1-4 h using the Epifluorescence
inverted microscope Axio Observer D1 (Carl Zeiss). The
microscope was controlled in an automated manner using
the Axio-Vision40 V 4.8.2.0 software and housed in a
home-made box to maintain a constant temperature of
37°C. Fluorescence and differential interference constrast
images were obtained. When necessary, manual focusing
was performed every 20 min using the fluorescence
channel. Time-lapse images were processed in Adobe
Photoshop CS5 indicating the movie progression time in
minutes.
