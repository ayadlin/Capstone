BACKGROUND: Altered glucose metabolism is the most common metabolic hallmark of malignancies. The
authors tested the hypothesis that glucose metabolism gene variations affect clinical outcome in pancreatic cancer.
METHODS: The authors retrospectively genotyped 26 single nucleotide polymorphisms from 5 glucose metabolism
genes in 154 patients with localized disease and validated the findings in 552 patients with different stages of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Association between genotypes and overall survival (OS) was evaluated using multivariate Cox
proportional hazard regression models with adjustment for clinical predictors. RESULTS: Glucokinase (GCK) IVS1 þ
9652C > T and hexokinase 2 (HK2) N692N homozygous variants were significantly associated with reduced OS in the
training set of 154 patients (P < .001). These associations were confirmed in the validation set of 552 patients and in
the combined dataset of all 706 patients (P  .001). In addition, HK2 R844K variant K allele was associated with a
better survival in the validation set and the combined dataset (P  .001). When data were further analyzed by disease

with localized disease and GCK IVS1 þ 9652C>T in patients with advanced disease were significant independent predictors for OS (P  .001). Haplotype CGG of GPI and GCTATGG of HK2 were associated with better OS, respectively,
with P values of .004 and .007. CONCLUSIONS: The authors demonstrated that glucose metabolism gene polymorphisms affect clinical outcome in pancreatic cancer. These observations support a role of abnormal glucose metaboC 2010 American Cancer Society.

A common property of malignant tumors is altered glucose metabolism. The Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis, a persistently high rate of glucose conversion into lactate even under normoxic condition) is a distinctive metabolic characteristic
of malignancies that distinguishes them from normal cells.1 Possibly this effect is an adaptation to intermittent hypoxia in
premalignant lesions. Enhanced glycolysis at the expense of mitochondrial energy production causing microenvironment
acidosis triggers evolution to phenotypes resistant to acid toxicity, provides precursors for macromolecule biosynthesis,
and protects cells from excessive toxic reactive oxygen species.2 Subsequent cell populations with intensified glycolysis and
acid resistance have a strong growth advantage, which promotes malignant proliferation, unrestrained growth, and invasion.3 On the basis of this prominent phenotype, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has become a major
method for cancer detection and surveillance. The worldwide clinical application of PET has resulted in a resurgence of interest in tumor metabolism.4 PET using the glucose analogue tracer 2-(18F)-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) has shown that
most cancers profoundly strengthen glucose uptake, which depends on glycolysis rate. FDG uptake/trapping results from
up-regulation of glucose transporters and hexokinases (HK1/2) in pancreatic cancer.5,6 This is a marker that can be used
to monitor cancer progression; the augmented glucose uptake correlates with enhanced tumor aggression, advanced clinical stage, and poorer prognosis.7,8
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States, with an estimated 42,470 new
cases and 35,240 deaths in 2009.9 Pancreatic cancer is 1 of the most difficult malignancies to treat, with a 5-year survival
rate <5%.9 Glucose intolerance and diabetes are common manifestations of pancreatic cancer. Whether and how genetic
variations in glucose metabolism affect the clinical outcome of this disease are unknown.

Glucose Metabolism and Pancreatic Cancer/Dong et al

HK2, glucokinase (GCK), glutamine-fructose-6phosphate transaminase (GFPT1), glucose phosphate
isomerase (GPI), and O-linked N-acetylglucosamine
transferase (OGT) are key enzymes involved in glucose
metabolism. For its crucial role in determining the cell
fate (survival or death),10 glucose metabolism pathway
has become a therapeutic target for cancer treatment,11
with clinical trials on HK2 inhibitors being conducted.12,13 We have previously shown that obesity and
diabetes are associated with reduced overall survival in
patients with pancreatic cancer.14,15 Whether genetic variations in glucose metabolism contribute to the poor clinical outcome of pancreatic cancer has never been explored.
To test the hypothesis that genetic variation in glucose
metabolism genes is related to clinical outcome in pancreatic cancer, we evaluated 26 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of GCK, GFPT1, GPI, HK2, and OGT
genes (Fig. 1) in reference to the overall survival (OS) and
response to chemoradiotherapy in 706 patients with pancreatic cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Recruitment and Data Collection
The 706 patients included 154 patients with resectable tumor who were enrolled in clinical trials of preoperative
gemcitabine-based chemoradiation16 and 552 patients
who were recruited in a case-control study conducted at
The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center
from February 1999 to May 2007, with follow-up to August 2009.17 Patients were eligible for the current study if
they had a diagnosis of pathologically confirmed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and had an available DNA
sample. All patients signed an informed consent for medical record review and DNA sample collection. The study
was approved by the institutional review board of The
University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center and
conducted in accordance with all current ethical
guidelines.
We reviewed patients’ medical records to collect demographic (age, sex, and self-reported race) and clinical
information on date of diagnosis; date of death or last follow-up; clinical tumor stage; tumor resection, site, size,
and differentiation; performance status; serum markers
for liver, kidney, and pancreas functions; and serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) level at diagnosis. Clinical tumor staging followed the objective computed
tomography (CT) criteria: a localized or potentially resectable tumor is defined as a tumor with no evidence of

2 and glucokinase (GCK)/HK4 phosphorylate glucose to produce glucose-6-phosphate (Glucose-6P), the first step in
most glucose metabolism pathways including glycolysis.25
GPI (phosphoglucose isomerase) catalyzes the reversible
isomerization of glucose-6P and fructose-6P, and guides the
glucose flow to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP).28 GPI
also functions as an autocrine motility factor (AMF), secreted
from the tumor cells to promote progression.29 Glutaminefructose-6-phosphate transaminase (GFPT1) is the first and
rate-limiting enzyme of the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway
(HBP) and controls the flux of glucose into the hexosamine
pathway. O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) is
a glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the addition of a single
N-acetylglucosamine in O-glycosidic linkage to serine or
threonine residues. O-linked glycosylation plays a role in controlling gene expression, fuel metabolism, cell growth, differentiation, and cytoskeleton organization.30 ATP indicates
adenosine triphosphate.

encasement or occlusion of the superior mesenteric veinportal vein confluence. Tumor abutment and encasement
of the superior mesenteric vein, in the absence of vessel
occlusion or extension to the superior mesenteric artery,
was considered resectable. Locally advanced tumors are
those unresectable but without distant metastasis. Tumor
response to preoperative therapy was evaluated by CT at
restaging in patients who had localized tumor and
received preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Tumor margin
and lymph node status were evaluated in patients with
resected tumors only. Dates of death were obtained and
cross-checked using the following sources: The University

copy-based MassArray method (Sequenom, San Diego,
Calif). We randomly genotyped 20% of total samples in
duplicate, showing 99.8% concordance. The inconsistent
data were excluded from final analysis.

DNA Extraction, SNP Selection,
and Genotyping
DNA was extracted from peripheral lymphocytes using
Qiagen (Valencia, Calif) DNA isolation kits. Seventeen
tagging SNPs were selected using SNPbrowser software
(Applied Biosystems, www.allsnps.com/snpbrowser) with
a cutoff of r2 ¼ 0.8 and a minor allele frequency 10%
in Caucasians from the HapMap Project database
(www.hapmap.org). We also included 9 coding SNPs
(nonsynonymous or synonymous) or untranslated region
(UTR) SNPs that have a minor allele frequency 5% in
Caucasians. The genes, nucleotide substitutions, functions, reference SNP identification numbers, and minor
allele frequencies of the 26 SNPs are described in Table 1.
The protein sequences, structures, homology models,
mRNA transcripts, and predicted functions for the SNPs
were evaluated by F-SNP (Queen’s University, Kingston,
Ontario, Canada).18 Genotyping used the mass spectros-

Statistical Analysis
The distribution of genotypes was tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with the goodness-of-fit chi-square test.
Genotype and allele frequency of the SNP were determined by direct gene counting. Haplotype diversity and
linkage disequilibrium index (Lewontin’s D0 and r2) were
calculated using SNPAlyze (DYNACOM Co., Mobara,
Japan). The median follow-up time was computed using
censored observations only. The association between genotype/haplotype and OS was evaluated by Cox proportional hazard regression models. Hazard ratios and 95%
confidence interval (CIs) were calculated with adjustment
of sex, race, and any clinical factors that are significant
predictors for OS in multivariate Cox regression models.
The association of genotype with categorical variables
such as sex, race, and tumor response to therapy was
examined using the chi-square test and a logistic regression model with adjustment for clinical factors. Statistical

analysis used SPSS (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill). The false discovery rate was calculated using the Beta-Uniform Mixture method.19 For 77 comparisons in a total of 26 SNPs
(38 SNPs in dominant and 39 in recessive inheritance
modes) for OS in all patients, we found that a P value
of.002 corresponded to an false discovery rate of 5%.
Thus, P  .002 in the genotype analysis was considered
statistically significant.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The patients’ demographics and clinical predictors for OS
are summarized in Table 2. There were 333 patients with
localized disease, 211 with locally advanced disease, and
162 with metastatic disease. Of the 333 patients with
localized tumor, 275 (83%) had tumor resection. Of the
706 patients, 138 (19.5%) were alive at the end of the
study, with a median follow-up time of 46.0 months. The
median survival time for the entire patient population was
17.2 months (95% CI, 15.8-18.5). Advanced tumor
stage, unresected tumor, an elevated CA19-9 serum level
or biochemical index, or poor performance status
remained as significant predictors for worse OS in multivariate Cox regression models (data not shown).
Genotype Distribution and Allele Frequencies
The observed allele frequencies in this study population
were comparable to the previously reported allele frequencies in the general population (Table 1). The distribution
of 26 SNPs followed Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P >
.05) except for OGT IVS18-424A>G (P ¼ .001). Linkage disequilibrium data of the 26 SNPs are described in
Table 3. There were significant sex and racial differences
in the genotype distributions; for example, the HK2
N692N CC genotype frequency was 22.4% for men but
10.3% for women (P < .001), and the HK2 R844K GG
genotype frequency was 63.9%, 53.5%, and 25.9% for
whites, Hispanics, and blacks, respectively (P < .001)
(data for other SNPs are not shown). Therefore, sex and
race were included in all Cox regression models.
Associations of Genotype with
Overall Survival
The association of each genotype with OS was first analyzed in a relatively homogenous population of 154
patients who had resectable tumor and were treated on
protocol for preoperative chemoradiotherapy. SNPs with

gene, GCTATGG and ATTACAT, were associated with
a better or worse OS, with a P value of .007 and .03,
respectively, in multivariate Cox regression (Table 6).
Two other haplotypes, GCCGCAT and ATTGCAT,
showed nonsignificant associations with OS (P ¼ .055
and .06). Apparently, haplotypes containing CAT of
N692N, L766L, and Ex18 þ 407T>G (30 UTR SNP) all
conferred a worse OS.

the genotype distribution of these 2 SNPs was significantly different by disease stage and tumor resection status. For example, the HK2 N692N CC genotype was
detected in 12.6%, 19.0%, and 25.9% of patients with
localized, locally advanced, and metastatic disease (P <

69.7% of the patients with advanced disease (P < .001,

had resectable tumors and received preoperative chemoradiotherapy. HK2 N692N and R844K genotype showed

significant independent predictors for OS. We also found
a significant association of HK2 N692N and R844K
genotype with disease stage, tumor resection status,
and response to preoperative chemoradiotherapy. These
data support a role of glucose metabolism gene polymorphisms in modifying the clinical outcome in pancreatic
cancer.
Hexokinases catalyze the phosphorylation of glucose
to glucose-6-phosphate. This is the first and rate-limiting
step in glucose metabolism. HK2 localizes to the outer
membrane of the mitochondria and is the major hexokinase isoform expressed in cancer cells.20 HK2 expression
is insulin responsive and responsible for the accelerated
glycolysis in cancer cells.21 Overexpression of HK2 in tumor tissues has been correlated to poor prognosis in breast
cancer and liver cancer but not in pancreatic cancer,7,22,23
although the negative finding in pancreatic cancer could
be partially explained by the heterogeneity of the study
population.23 We observed 2 HK2 SNPs, R844K and
N692N, significantly associated with OS, tumor stage, tumor resection status, and tumor response to therapy. HK2
R844K, an evolutionary conservative SNP, K variant, is
computationally predicted to deleteriously affect protein
coding and RNA splicing, which change the solvent accessibility and hydrophobicity of the protein.18 The K variant thus may confer a dysfunctional low enzymatic
activity of HK2, impose restraint on glycolysis rate, and
dampen tumor progression because of lack of energy supply. Indeed, a better response to therapy, a higher tumor
resection rate, and a longer OS were observed among
patients carrying the K variant allele (GA/AA genotype).
The functional significance of the synonymous SNP HK2
N692N is unknown. By computational prediction, such
an SNP may result in altered conformation, substrate affinity, and mRNA splicing.18 Whether such changes
result in a higher enzyme activity, which may explain the
association of the variant allele with reduced OS, needs
further investigation. We observed that the HK2 N692N
CC frequency in men was higher than that in women, and
concluded that CC represents higher enzyme activity;
whether the genotype difference contributes to a previously reported higher HK enzyme activity in men than
women needs further investigation.24 We also observed
that haplotypes containing variant alleles of HK2 N692N,
L766L, and Ex18 þ 407T>G (30 -UTR SNP) were associated with worse OS. It is possible that these genotypes/
haplotypes conferred a higher level/activity of HK2, contributing to a higher rate of glycolysis, accelerated tumor
progression, and reduced OS.

Cancer

February 1, 2011

We found 3 intronic SNPs that were associated with
OS, GCK IVS1 þ 9652 TT genotype in patients with
advanced diseases, GFPT1 IVS14-3094T>C in all
patients and in patients with localized tumors, and a GPI
haplotype containing the IVS9 þ 2363C>G G allele in
all patients. GCK is another member of the hexokinase
family, catalyzing the adenosine triphosphate-dependent
phosphorylation of glucose. Unlike HK2, GCK activity is
not inhibited by its product glucose-6-phosphate, but
remains active while glucose is abundant. GCK plays a
role in maintaining glucose homeostasis as the glucosesensor and glycolysis pacemaker involved in regulating insulin secretion.25 We speculate that there is an increased
demand for glucose phosphorylation in advanced tumors
because of the rapid cell growth, so GCK is required to
maintain a constantly active glucose metabolism. The
GFPT1 gene encoding glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate
transaminase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the
hexosamine biosynthesis pathway, controls the glucose
flux into the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway. The hexosamine biosynthesis pathway is responsible for shuttling
glucose to cellular glycosylation events, for example, promoting N-linked glycosylation of Wnt-related proteins.26
Glucose flux into the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway
initiates post-translational modifications of cytoplasmic
and nuclear proteins that regulate signal transduction,
transcription, and protein degradation.27 GPI catalyzes
the reversible isomerization of glucose-6-phosphate and
fructose-6-phosphate, and plays a central role in glycolysis
and gluconeogenesis. GPI can guide the glucose flow to
the pentose phosphate pathway to produce nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate and pentose.28 GPI also
functions as an autocrine motility factor, secreted from
the tumor cells to promote cell migration, progression,
and metastasis and to help the cells survive and proliferate
under hypoxic and nutrient-deprived conditions.29
Although the functional significance of these intron SNPs
is unknown, the variant alleles may affect the binding of
transcriptional factors to the gene, thus up-regulating the
mRNA and protein expression.18 The possibility that
these SNPs are in linkage with unidentified functional
SNPs could not be excluded.
OGT catalyzes the addition of a single N-acetylglucosamine in O-glycosidic linkage to serine or threonine
residues. O-linked glycosylation plays a role in controlling
gene expression, fuel metabolism, cell growth, differentiation, and cytoskeleton organization.30 We did not observe
any significant association of the OGT genotype/haplotype with OS, partly because only 2 SNPs were examined

in this study. Further study of this gene is warranted when
additional SNPs are revealed by DNA sequencing.
Strengths of our study includes detailed clinical information, a large sample size, a 2-step design, and a hypothesis-driven gene selection. Limitations of the study
include the limited number of genes and SNPs evaluated
and the potentially false-positive findings owing to multiple comparisons. To keep the false discovery rate <5%,
we applied a P value of .002 as the significance level in the
genotype analysis. However, the frequencies of most
homozygotes with major effects on clinical outcome are
relatively low, so the possibility that these observations are
by chance alone cannot be excluded. Additional studies
with larger samples in different patient populations are
required to confirm these findings. Furthermore, demonstrating the functional significances of these gene traits is
pivotal in understanding their role in pancreatic cancer.
Nevertheless, our findings provided supporting evidence
for the importance of the glucose metabolism pathway in
pancreatic cancer. Whether these genetic markers have a
potential value in predicting response to glucose metabolism-targeted therapy in pancreatic cancer is under current
investigation.
