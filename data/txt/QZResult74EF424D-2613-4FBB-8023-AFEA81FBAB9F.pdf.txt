Abstract

HHMI Author Manuscript

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease characterized by an intense
fibrotic stromal response and deregulated metabolism1–4. The role of the stroma in PDAC biology
is complex and it has been shown to play critical roles that differ depending on the biological
context5–10. The stromal reaction also impairs the vasculature, leading to a highly hypoxic,
nutrient-poor environment4,11,12. As such, these tumours must alter how they capture and use
nutrients to support their metabolic needs11,13. Here we show that stroma-associated pancreatic
stellate cells (PSCs) are critical for PDAC metabolism through the secretion of non-essential
amino acids (NEAA). Specifically, we uncover a previously undescribed role for alanine, which
outcompetes glucose and glutamine-derived carbon in PDAC to fuel the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
cycle, and thus NEAA and lipid biosynthesis. This shift in fuel source decreases the tumour’s
dependence on glucose and serum-derived nutrients, which are limited in the pancreatic tumour
microenvironment4,11. Moreover, we demonstrate that alanine secretion by PSCs is dependent on
PSC autophagy, a process that is stimulated by cancer cells. Thus, our results demonstrate a novel
metabolic interaction between PSCs and cancer cells, in which PSC-derived alanine acts as an
alternative carbon source. This finding highlights a previously unappreciated metabolic network
within pancreatic tumours in which diverse fuel sources are used to promote growth in an austere
tumour microenvironment.

We previously demonstrated that metabolism is rewired in pancreatic cancer cells to
facilitate biosynthesis and maintain redox balance in the nutrient-poor conditions of a
pancreatic tumour2,14,15. While extracellular protein can provide nutrients to the starved
cancer cells11,13, we hypothesized that the stroma may provide additional avenues of
metabolic support for the tumour. Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are a predominant cell
type in the pancreatic tumour stroma and are important mediators of the desmoplastic
response. Their abundance suggests that they may contribute to the metabolism of cancer
cells. To test this idea, we assessed changes in the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and
extracellular media acidification rate (ECAR), measures of mitochondrial activity and
glycolysis, respectively, in PDAC cells treated with conditioned medium from a well
characterized human PSC (hPSC) line16 (Fig. 1a, b and Extended Data Fig. 1a–e). PDAC
glycolysis showed minimal changes when cells were treated with PSC-conditioned medium,
as measured by ECAR (Extended Data Fig. 1d, e). By contrast, we observed a consistent
increase of 20–40% in the basal OCR after treatment with hPSC medium (Fig. 1a, b and
Extended Data Fig. 1a–c), a feature that was independent of serum during the conditioning
process (Extended Data Fig. 1f, g) and reproducible with multiple primary specimens (Fig.
1b and Extended Data Fig. 1h, i). Notably, this metabolic phenotype was specific to
pancreatic cancer cells; non-transformed pancreatic ductal epithelial cells did not exhibit
increased OCR in response to PSC medium (Extended Data Fig. 1j).

To identify the nature of the PSC-secreted factors that alter PDAC metabolism, we subjected
conditioned medium to three freeze-thaw cycles (−80 °C, 60 °C) or heating (100 °C, 15 min)
and observed that it retained the ability to increase PDAC OCR (Fig. 1c and Extended Data
Fig. 1k–m), indicating that the factor(s) lacked tertiary structure. Moreover, the activity was
retained in medium passed through a 3-kDa cut-off filter (Extended Data Fig. 1n). The small
size and resistance to extreme temperatures of the OCR-increasing factor(s) excluded large
candidate molecules such as proteins, indicating that the factor(s) could be metabolites.
We next performed a series of metabolomic studies17 to identify metabolites that were
secreted by PSCs and taken up by PDAC cells (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Specifically, we
sought molecules that were over-represented in PSC medium (and therefore secreted by
PSCs); under-represented in the PSC medium after contact with PDAC cells (removed by
PDAC cells); and over-represented inside PDAC cells treated with the PSC medium (taken
up by PDAC cells). Of approximately 200 metabolites analysed, only the non-essential
amino acids (NEAA) alanine and aspartate followed this pattern (Fig. 1d and Extended Data
Fig. 2b). Treatment of PDAC cells with the individual amino acids revealed that only alanine
had the ability to increase PDAC OCR to a degree comparable to that of PSC-conditioned
medium (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 2c).

To demonstrate that PSC-derived metabolites, and alanine specifically, were being taken up
by PDAC cells, we performed metabolite tracing experiments in which PSCs were grown to
saturation in medium containing uniformly carbon-13-labelled (U13C-)glucose and U13Cglutamine to label secreted NEAAs (Extended Data Fig. 2d). The conditioned medium from
the labelled cells was then added to PDAC cells, allowing us to track the production and
secretion of alanine by the PSCs and to follow its depletion from PSC medium upon contact
with PDAC cells (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Quantification revealed that secreted alanine in
the PSC medium reached millimolar concentration within 24 h of conditioning (Fig. 1f and
Extended Data Fig. 2f–i), and this occurred independent of serum in the medium (Extended
Data Fig. 2h). In the context of a tumour in vivo, the more important parameters to assess
are the release and uptake of alanine relative to other nutrients. Accordingly, we performed
kinetic studies and found that alanine was secreted by the PSCs at the greatest rate of the 14
amino acids measured and more rapidly than even lactate (Extended Data Fig. 2j, k).
Alanine was also one of only two amino acids to accumulate in PDAC cells, achieving an
enrichment of greater than fivefold (Extended Data Fig. 2l).
We next investigated how PDAC cells metabolize PSC-derived alanine. Alanine could
increase OCR by fuelling the TCA cycle, and a likely route for this is through
transamination of alanine into pyruvate (Fig. 2a). Consistently, depletion of the cytosolic or
mitochondrial alanine transaminase (GPT1 or GPT2, respectively) in PDAC cells (Extended
Data Fig. 3a) resulted in an increase in accumulation of alanine (Fig. 2b) and a decrease in
OCR in PSC medium-treated PDAC cells (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 3b, c). Moreover,
direct addition of pyruvate to PDAC cells increased OCR (Fig. 2d). We then performed
U-13C-Ala tracing studies to assess how alanine was being used in PDAC metabolism.
Treatment of cells with 1 mM U-13C-Ala led to a 5–10-fold increase in the intracellular
alanine pool (Extended Data Fig. 3d–h). Carbon from alanine did not contribute to upstream
glycolytic intermediates (Extended Data Fig. 3i, j) or alter glycolytic flux (Extended Data

Fig. 3k) or the NAD+/NADH ratio (Extended Data Fig. 3l, m), and it contributed minimally
to the intracellular lactate pool (Extended Data Fig. 3d, n), irrespective of the extracellular
glucose concentration (Extended Data Fig. 3o–q). These results suggested that alaninederived pyruvate was being used in the mitochondria, because it was not affecting cytosolic
glycolytic metabolism. Indeed, alanine was a major carbon source for the TCA cycle; 13C
was markedly incorporated into citrate and isocitrate, and, to a lesser extent, malate and
fumarate (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Figs 4, 5), as well as into the NEAAs aspartate and
glutamate (Extended Data Fig. 4–5), which can be biosynthesized from TCA cycle
intermediates in PDAC cells14. Indeed, citrate was one of the major recipients of alanine
carbon, with labelling ranging from 23% to 46% among PDAC lines (Fig. 2f and Extended
Data Figs 4, 5).

HHMI Author Manuscript

We also observed that the alanine-derived pyruvate competed meaningfully with
mitochondrial but not cytosolic glucose-derived pyruvate based on the citrate (M2, where M
refers to metabolite and 2 the number of 13C atoms present) and lactate (M3) labelling
patterns following U-13C-Ala or U-13C-glucose tracing studies (Extended Data Figs 3d, i, j,
o–q, 4, 5, 6a). These results illustrate that alanine carbon is being used selectively to fuel
mitochondrial metabolism and are consistent with our earlier observations that the addition
of alanine does not disrupt glycolysis (Extended Data Fig. 3i–k). A principle function of
mitochondrial pyruvate in proliferating cells is to contribute to citrate generation via its
conversion to acetyl coenzyme A (Ac-CoA). This citrate (labelled with the two Ac-CoA
carbons, M2) is then released into the cytosol and used as a building block for fatty acid
biosynthesis. As shown in Fig. 2g, h, more than 20% of total palmitate and 10% of total
stearate contained alanine-derived 13C, rivalling the contribution derived from glucose
(around 50% and 20%, respectively; Extended Data Fig. 6b–g), and illustrating the
importance of alanine in lipid biosynthesis. The production of citrate from alanine for fatty
acid biosynthesis requires an additional TCA cycle input to support anaplerosis. Indeed, we
observed that alanine could also serve in this role through pyruvate carboxylase, as
evidenced by M3 labelling of citrate and other TCA cycle intermediates from U-13C–Ala
(Extended Data Figs 4, 5).

HHMI Author Manuscript

We also found that addition of alanine increased flux through the serine biosynthetic
pathway in PDAC cells (Extended Data Fig. 6h–j). This pathway uses glucose to generate
the NEAAs serine and glycine, which are used for, among other processes, the de novo
biosynthesis of nucleic acids. U-13C-glucose tracing studies confirmed that alanine
promoted flux of glucose-derived carbon through this pathway (Extended Data Fig. 6h), an
effect that was more pronounced under the glucose-limiting conditions, which resemble
poorly perfused pancreatic tumours (Extended Data Fig. 6j). Collectively, these results
demonstrated that alanine-derived carbon could supplant glucose-derived carbon in TCA
cycle metabolism (to make lipids and NEAAs), thereby enabling glucose to be used for
additional biosynthetic functions such as the serine biosynthetic pathway. Glutamine
metabolism was also altered in the presence of exogenous alanine, with more alanine being
incorporated into the TCA cycle in place of glutamine carbon (Extended Data Fig. 6k, l), but
this occurred to a much lower degree relative to glucose-derived carbon in most PDAC lines.

One possible source of PSC-secreted alanine was protein catabolism. Given the critical role
of autophagy in PDAC18,19, we tested whether the secretion of alanine was autophagydependent. PSCs in culture exhibit readily detectable levels of basal autophagy, as
demonstrated by LC3 puncta (representing autophagosomes; Extended Data Fig. 7a), and
exhibit appreciable levels of autophagic flux (Fig. 3a–c and Extended Data Fig. 7b–d).
Notably, co-culture with PDAC cells (Fig. 3a, b), or treatment with PDAC-conditioned
medium (Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. 7d), significantly increased autophagic flux in
PSCs. To assess the importance of autophagy in the secretion of alanine, we inhibited
autophagy in PSCs using short hairpin (sh)RNAs targeting the essential autophagy genes
ATG5 and ATG7 (Extended Data Fig. 7b, c, e, f) and measured the ability of the PSCconditioned medium to increase PDAC OCR. The ability of PSC medium to increase OCR
in PDAC cells was abolished upon knockdown of autophagy genes (Fig. 3d and Extended
Data Fig. 7g) and could be rescued by addition of exogenous alanine (Extended Data Fig.
7h). Consistently, we observed a drop in the levels of both intracellular alanine and secreted
alanine when autophagy was impaired in hPSCs (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 7i–m).
Furthermore, intracellular alanine accumulation in PDAC cells was also diminished
following treatment with autophagy-impaired PSC-conditioned medium (Fig. 3f). In contrast
to PDAC cells, which respond robustly to autophagy inhibition18,19, PSC proliferation was
largely insensitive to autophagy impairment (Extended Data Fig. 7n). Even under nutrientdepleted conditions, PSC survival was not altered when autophagy was impaired (Extended
Data Fig. 7o, p), indicating that altered PSC survival was not the cause of decreased alanine
secretion. In sum, these data provide evidence for two-way intratumoral metabolic crosstalk, in which cancer cells release a signal to PSCs that results in the induction of autophagy
and the release of alanine.

We next sought to determine whether these PSC-induced metabolic alterations in PDAC
would have an impact on PDAC proliferation. Not surprisingly, in high-nutrient medium (25
mM glucose, 4 mM Gln, full serum), the impact of PSC medium on PDAC proliferation was
not significant (Extended Data Fig. 8a). By contrast, when grown in a low-nutrient setting
(serum-free or glucose-limiting conditions), recapitulating the austere microenvironment in
vivo, there was a significant positive effect of PSC medium on PDAC proliferation (Fig. 4a
and Extended Data Fig. 8b–f). Notably, PSC medium from autophagy-impaired cells did not
produce this growth-promoting effect (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 8d–i).
Supplementation of serum-free or low-glucose medium with alanine was also able to rescue
growth in a manner similar to PSC medium (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 8d–f, j–l), while
having a minimal effect in nutrient-rich settings (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Moreover, alanine
was able to restore the growth-promoting ability of PSC medium from autophagy-impaired
cells (Extended Data Fig. 8g). Consistent with the proposed mechanism, pyruvate (the
product of the transamination of alanine), but not lactate, was able to sustain PDAC
proliferation in glucose-limited medium (Extended Data Fig. 8j–l). Similarly, GPT1
knockdown in PDAC cells grown under serum-free conditions significantly attenuated the
effects of PSC medium or alanine on proliferation (Extended Data Fig. 8m).
To determine whether this cross-feeding mechanism was operative in vivo, we developed a
co-injection system in which PSCs could be manipulated genetically and then implanted
alongside cancer cells into the flanks of mice. Although previous studies have shown that

co-injection of PSCs with PDAC cells promotes tumour growth16, the contribution of
metabolic cross-talk to this effect has not been explored. The fact that autophagy is required
for PSC alanine secretion, while having a minimal impact on proliferation and no effect on
survival (Extended Data Fig. 7n–p), permits selective attenuation of this metabolic cross-talk
so that its role in tumour growth can be assessed. We therefore performed co-injection
studies with limiting numbers of PDAC cells along with autophagy-competent or
incompetent PSCs (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Consistent with the in vitro proliferation data,
both tumour take and tumour growth kinetics were increased significantly when co-injected
with autophagy-competent PSCs, and this increase was significantly attenuated when PDAC
cells were co-injected with autophagy-incompetent PSCs (Fig. 4b, c and Extended Data Fig.
9b–e). Notably, the predominant effect of PSC growth support in these assays appears to be
during tumour initiation or tumour take (Fig. 4b, c and Extended Data Fig. 9c, d); at later
time points the autophagy-incompetent PSC-containing tumours approximate their
autophagy-competent counterparts (Extended Data Fig. 9b, e). Indeed, the cancer cells
ultimately form the majority of the grafted tumours, even with the wild-type PSCs
(Extended Data Fig. 9f, g). Quantification of stellate cells by western blot for RFP
(exogenous PSCs were marked with RFP) showed that while the levels of RFP expression
varied by individual tumour, there were no significant differences between groups based on
autophagy status (Extended Data Fig. 9h, i).
Consistent with the results from the subcutaneous model, diminution of autophagy in PSCs
slowed tumour growth and increased tumour-free survival in orthotopic assays (Extended
Data Fig. 10a–d). The orthotopic tumours contained more PSCs than the subcutaneous
tumours, but again PSCs were less abundant than tumour cells (Extended Data Fig. 10e). To
further validate the in vivo relevance of this mechanism, we used a syngeneic system
consisting of cancer cells and PSCs derived from our murine PDAC autochthonous
models15. Consistent with our findings using human PDAC and PSC lines, murine PSCs
improved tumour engraftment in an autophagy-dependent manner (Fig. 4d, e and Extended
Data Fig. 7l, m).

Our work demonstrates growth-promoting metabolic cross-talk between stromal PSCs and
epithelial cancer cells (Fig. 4f). Previous work has illustrated that intratumoral metabolic
cross-talk can occur between different populations of cells in a tumour20,21. For example,
hypoxic cancer cells in colorectal and lung cancer models preferentially consume glucose
and provide well-oxygenated cancer cells with lactate for oxidative metabolism21. More
recently, others have suggested that stromal cells can alter the metabolism of pancreatic
cancer cells22 and that this can occur with exosomes as a vehicle for non-selective
metabolite delivery20. While alterations in lactate and alanine were recently reported using
imaging studies during pancreatic cancer progression in mouse models, these studies did not
have the spatial resolution to distinguish between different cell types within the tumour and
would not be able to detect metabolic cross-talk between cancer cells and fibroblasts23. Our
work, using pancreatic cancer model systems and in vivo co-transplantation assays,
demonstrate a specific role of PSC-derived alanine, whose carbon competes with glucosederived carbon as a metabolic substrate—effects not recapitulated with exogenous lactate.

Protein catabolized through autophagy is the source of secreted alanine from PSCs. Given
that alanine is the second most represented amino acid in proteins, catabolism can provide
an important source of free alanine24. We found that PDAC cells stimulate autophagy in
PSCs and selectively consume the released alanine, using this carbon in the TCA cycle
following its conversion to pyruvate. Notably, alanine-derived pyruvate does not equilibrate
with cytosolic pyruvate. As such, it provides a direct mitochondrial carbon source without
changing the cytosolic NAD+/NADH redox balance. This results in increased mitochondrial
oxygen consumption as well as lipid biosynthesis. Importantly, the metabolism of alanine
allows traditional carbon sources such as glucose to be more available for other biosynthetic
processes, such as the synthesis of serine and glycine, which are precursors for nucleic acid
biosynthesis. This cooperative metabolism promotes tumour growth and is particularly
relevant in nutrient-limited conditions.

HHMI Author Manuscript

According to this mechanism, we would predict that PSC-mediated alanine secretion would
be less relevant under circumstances in which pancreatic cancer cells are able to access
nutrients through the vasculature directly, such as those in PSC-ablated pancreatic
tumours8,9. In contrast, alteration of PSC features (inhibiting autophagy, for example)
without their ablation would allow the continued, PSC-mediated restraint of tumour growth
while potentially sensitizing the tumour to treatment. A recent example of this strategy
demonstrated that stromal reprogramming of PDAC with vitamin D sensitized them to
chemotherapy25.
Collectively, these findings are important for the following reasons. First, they shed light on
the complex biology of tumour–stroma interactions. Furthermore, they highlight the
importance of studying the metabolism of highly desmoplastic tumours such as PDAC in the
proper context, in this case in the presence of relevant supporting cell types. Last, this
cooperative metabolism between cancer cells and PSCs, which is dependent on autophagy,
further substantiates the critical role of metabolic scavenging in PDAC and suggests that
inhibition of autophagy and other lysosomal degradation pathways may have an even greater
therapeutic utility in this disease than previously appreciated.

METHODS

Cell culture
The cell lines 8988T, MiaPaCa2, Tu8902, Panc1, MPanc96 and IMR90 were obtained from
ATCC or the DSMZ. hPSCs (hPSC#1) have been previously described16. hPSC#2 was
isolated from an untreated human PDAC resection and considered de-identified ‘surgical
waste’ tissue under IRB approved protocols 03-189 and 11-104. Patients gave informed
consent for tissue collection. Stromal cells that outgrew the cancer cells in culture were
isolated by differential trypsinization and immortalized by infection with hTERT and
SV40gp6 (Addgene plasmids #22396 and #10891, respectively) retro-viruses. These cells
were kept in DMEM (Life Technologies 11965) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/
Strep (Life Technologies 15140). Primary human pancreatic cancer-associated fibroblasts
were isolated from tumour resections in a similar manner as above, under IRB approved
protocol STU 102010-051, but were not immortalized. Cells were kept in DMEM
supplemented with 10% CCS (Thermo Scientific) and 1% Pen/Strep. PSCs were verified by

measuring Desmin and SMA expression. HPDE have been previously described and grown
as indicated26. All cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma by PCR and PDAC lines were
typically authenticated by fingerprinting as well as visual inspection and carefully
maintained in a centralized cell bank. mPSCs were isolated from normal mice pancreata and
purified by centrifugation using a Nycodenz gradient and activated by in vitro culture, as
described25.
Black 6 (B6) mPSCs were generated from B6 females (Taconic, B6NTac) harbouring mouse
PDAC. These animals were pre-treated with doxycycline diet and kept in doxycycline
regimen for the duration of the experiment and were injected with 5 × 105 iKRAS mPDAC
cells15 into the pancreas. Pancreatic tumours were resected at 2 weeks, digested in
collagenase and dispase and mechanically minced. Cells were plated in cell culture dishes in
DMEM (Gibco) with 15% FBS in the absence of doxycycline to limit the growth of iKRAS
mouse PDAC cells. mPSCs were immortalized by infection with hTERT and SV40gp6
(Adgene plasmids #22396 and #10891, respectively) retro-viruses. Cells were kept in
DMEM (Gibco) with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/strep.

mCherry-hPSCs are hPSC#1 labelled with mCherry through infection with a lentivirus
expressing mCherry.
Conditioned medium was generated by adding fresh medium to cells at >50% confluence.
Medium was harvested 48 h later and passed through 0.45-μm filters. For size cut-off
experiments conditioned medium was filtered through 3-kDa cutoff columns (EMD
Millipore, UFC900308). Concentrated (>3kDa) medium was resuspended in a DMEM
volume matching the initial medium volume. Boiled medium experiments were performed
by heating conditioned medium at 100 °C for 15 min followed by filtration at 0.45 μm to
remove precipitate. Freeze-thaw medium was treated by 3 consecutive cycles of 15 min at
−80 °C followed by 15 min at 60 °C and then filtered to remove precipitate.

The tandem fluorescence LC3-reporter stable hPSC cells were generated by retroviral
infection of hPSCs with pBABE-puro mCherry-EGFP-LC3B (Addgene plasmid #22418).
For autophagic flux quantification experiments, 7.5 × 104 hPSC-LC3 cells were plated in
12-well plates with cover slips and 3 × 105 PDAC or hPSC cells were added 4 h later. Cover
slips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (ThermoFisher, 28908) after cells had been in
contact for 24 h. Coverslips were mounted in DAPI containing mounting solution (Life
Technologies P36931). Cells were imaged on a Yokogawa Spinning Disk Confocal in FITC,
RFP and DAPI channels. The ratio of red:yellow puncta was determined by counting puncta
using the Cell Counter imageJ plugin.
Oil-red O staining was performed on cells plated on glass cover slips and fixed 24 h after
plating in 4% paraformaldehyde (Thermo-Fisher, 28908) for 15 min. Cells were rinsed with
PBS followed by a rinse with 60% isopropanol and stained with freshly prepared Oil Red O
working solution comprised of 3 ml of 0.5% solution (Sigma, O1391) and 2 ml of H2O for
15 min, rinsed with 60% isopropanol and counterstained with Heamatoxylin. Cover slips
were then washed in H2O, mounted in Vectashield and imaged using a Leica DM2000
bright-field microscope.

Growth curves were obtained as previously described19. Cell growth over 48 h was assessed
in clear bottom 96-well plates (Costar 3603, Corning Incorporated) by CellTiter-Glo
(Promega G7572) analysis 48 h post treatment with conditioned medium or metabolites and
determined by the mean of at least three wells per condition. Luminescence was measured
on a POLARstar Omega plate reader.
Metabolism experiments

HHMI Author Manuscript

OCR and ECAR experiments were performed using the XF-96 apparatus from Seahorse
Bioscience. Cells were plated (16,000 cells per well for 8988T; 20,000 cells for Tu8902 or
Panc-1; 50,000 cells for HPDE) in at least quadruplicate for each condition the day before
the experiment. The next day, medium was completely replaced with conditioned medium
(75 μl of conditioned medium and 25 μl of fresh medium) or fresh medium containing either
1 mM L-alanine (Sigma A7469), 1 mM of NEAAs (Gibco 11140), 1 mM glycine (Sigma
G8790), 1 mM aspartate (Sigma A4534) or 1 mM cysteine (Sigma A9165). 20 h later,
medium was replaced by reconstituted DMEM with 25 mM glucose and 2 mM glutamine
(no sodium bicarbonate) adjusted to pH~7.4 and incubated for 30 min at 37% in a CO2-free
incubator. For the mitochondrial stress test (Seahorse 101706-100), oligomycin, FCCP and
rotenone were injected to a final concentration of 2 μM, 0.5μM and 4 μM, respectively. For
the glycolysis stress test (Seahorse 102194-100), glucose, oligomycin and 2-deoxyglucose
were injected to a final concentration of 10 mM, 2 μM and 100 mM, respectively. OCR and
ECAR were normalized to cell number as determined by CellTiter-Glo analysis at the end of
the experiments.
Metabolomics

HHMI Author Manuscript

Steady-state metabolomics experiments were performed as previously described14. Briefly,
PDAC cell lines were grown to ~80% confluence in growth medium (DMEM, 2 mM
glutamine, 10 mM glucose, 10% CCS) on 6 cm dishes in biological triplicate. A complete
medium change was performed two hours before metabolite collection. To trace the effect of
alanine on glutamine and glucose metabolism, PDAC cell lines were grown as above and
then transferred into glutamine-free (with 10 mM glucose) or glucose-free (with 2 mM
glutamine) DMEM containing 10% dialysed FBS and supplemented with either 2 mM
U-13C-glutamine (± 1 mM alanine) or 10 mM U-13C-glucose (± 1 mM alanine),
respectively, overnight. To trace alanine metabolism, PDAC cell lines were grown as above
and then transferred into DMEM (with 10 mM glucose, 2 mM glutamine, 10% dialysed
FBS) and supplemented with 1 mM U-13C-alanine overnight. Additionally, fresh medium
containing the labelled metabolite was exchanged 2 h before metabolite extraction for
steady-state analyses. To trace glucose metabolism in low-glucose conditions, cells were
grown in 0.5 mM of glucose and medium was refreshed every 8 h for the 24 h labelling
period to achieve steady-state labelling. For all metabolomics experiments, the quantity of
the metabolite fraction analysed was adjusted to the corresponding protein concentration
calculated upon processing a parallel well in a 6-cm dish.
To collect labelled conditioned medium, hPSC or 8988T cells were grown for three passages
in DMEM containing 10 mM U-13C-glucose, 2 mM U-13C-Gln and 10% dialysed FBS. This

medium was then replaced by DMEM with unlabelled glucose, glutamine and 10% dialysed
FBS, and incubated for 48 h, filtered and processed for metabolite extraction. Metabolite
extraction of medium was performed by adding 200 μl of filtered fresh conditioned medium
to 800 μl of cold (−80 °C) methanol, incubated at −80 °C for 30 min followed by
centrifugation at 10,000g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resultant supernatant was lyophilized by
speedvac and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Dried metabolite pellets were re-suspended in
20 μl LC–MS grade water, 5 μl were injected onto a Prominence UFLC and separated using
a 4.6 mm i.d. × 100 mm Amide XBridge HILIC column at 360 μl per minute starting from
85% buffer B (100% ACN) to 0% B over 16 min. Buffer A: 20 mM NH4OH/20 mM
CH3COONH4 (pH = 9.0) in 95:5 water/ACN. 287 selected reaction monitoring (SRM)
transitions were captured using positive/negative polarity switching by targeted LC-MS/MS
using a 5500 QTRAP hybrid triple quadrupole mass spectrometer.
For kinetics of metabolite secretion by hPSCs, triplicate samples of subconfluent hPSCs
cultured under normal conditions were changed to fresh DMEM with 10% dialysed FBS,
which was allowed to condition for 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, or 72 h. Fresh DMEM with 10% dialysed
FBS was used as a blank control. Metabolites were then extracted from conditioned medium
by adding ice cold 100% MeOH to a final concentration of 80% MeOH.

For PDAC metabolite uptake kinetics, conditioned DMEM with 10% dialysed FBS from
subconfluent hPSCs was collected after 48 h of culture, and then filtered through a 0.45 μm
filter. 8988T PDAC cells were plated in triplicate and treated with the PSC-conditioned
medium or fresh DMEM with 10% dialysed FBS for 1, 2, 4, 8, or 24 h. The medium was
removed and the cell lysate harvested with ice cold 80% MeOH. The soluble metabolite
fractions were cleared by centrifugation, dried under nitrogen, then resuspended in 50:50
MeOH:H2O mixture for LC–MS analysis.

For the kinetic analyses, a Shimadzu Nexera X2 UHPLC combined with a Sciex 5600 Triple
TOFMS was used, which was controlled by Sciex Analyst 1.7.1 instrument acquiring
software. A Supelco Ascentis Express HILIC (7.5 cm × 3mm, 2.7 μm) column was used
with mobile phase (A) consisting of 5 mM NH4OAc and 0.1% formic acid; mobile phase
(B) consisting of 98% CAN, 2% 5 mM NH4OAc and 0.1% formic acid. Gradient program:
mobile phase (A) was held at 10% for 0.5 min and then increased to 50% in 3 min; then to
99% in 4.1 min and held for 1.4 min before returning initial condition. The column was held
at 40 °C and 5 μl of sample was injected into the LC–MS with a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min.
Calibrations of TOFMS were achieved through reference APCI source with average mass
accuracy of less than 5 ppm except for alanine, which was 20 ppm. Key MS parameters were
the collision energy and spread of 25 eV and 10 eV for positive product ion acquisition and
−35 eV and 15 eV for negative acquisition. 100 MRM transitions were set on the MS
method. Data Processing Software included Sciex PeakView 2.2, MasterView 1.1,
LibraryView (64 bit) and MultiQuant 3.0.2.
For analysis of palmitate and stearate, PDAC cells in log growth were labelled in biological
quadruplicate with either 5.5 mM U-13C-glucose or 1 mM U-13C-Ala in DMEM containing
2 mM glutamine and 10% dialysed FBS for 3 days. Unlabelled species were used at

h, medium was refreshed for 2 h, and samples were collected by quick rinse in ddH2O
followed by liquid nitrogen quenching directly on cells. Plates were then stored at −80 °C
before extraction. Polar metabolites and fatty acids were extracted using methanol/water/
chloroform, as described27. Samples were placed on ice and 10 μl of 1.2 mM D27 myristic
acid as internal standard was introduced to each cell plate. 400 μl of cold water and 400 μl of
methanol were added to each sample. Cells were collected in a centrifuge tube and 400 μl of
ice-cold chloroform was added to each tube. Extracts were vortexed at 4 °C for 30 min and
centrifuged at 14,000×G for 20 min at 4 °C. The lower (organic) phase was recovered, and
samples were nitrogen dried before reconstitution in 50 μl of Methyl-8 reagent (Thermo) at
60 °C for 1 h to generate fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs).

GC–MS analysis was performed using an Agilent 7890A GC equipped with a 30 m
DB-5MS+DG capillary column and a Leap CTC PAL ALS as the sample injector. The GC
was connected to an Agilent 5975C quadrupole MS operating under positive electron impact
ionization at 70 eV. Tunings and data acquisition were done with ChemStation E.02.01, PAL
Loader 1.1.1, Agilent Pal Control Software Rev A and Pal Object Manager updated
firmware. MS tuning parameters were optimized so that PFTBA tuning ion abundance ratios
of 69:219:512 were 100:114:12, increasing high ion abundance. Agilent Fiehn retention time
locking (RLT) GC method was used and calibrated with standard FAMEs (Agilent) and
confirmed with Agilent G1677AA Fiehn GC/MS metabolomics RTL Library. For
measurement of FAMEs, the GC injection port was set at 250 °C and GC oven temperature
was held at 60 °C for 1 min and increased to 320 °C at a rate of 10 °C/minute, then held for
10 min under constant flow with initial pressure of 10.91 psi. The MS source and
quadrupole were held at 230 °C and 159 °C, respectively, and the detector was run in
scanning mode, recording ion abundance in the range of 35–600 m/z with solvent delay time
of 5.9 min. Data extraction was done with Agilent MassHunter WorkStation Software
GCMS Quantitative Analysis Version B.07. Additional isotope correction was performed
using an in-house software tool from MATLab28.
All 13C isotopic reagents were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories.

When comparing multiple groups with more than one changing variable (for example,
experiments where cells were treated with different shRNAs and with different conditioned
media) a two-way ANOVA test was performed. For experiments where we analysed one
variable for multiple conditions, a one-way ANOVA was performed. In both cases, ANOVA
analyses were followed by Tukey’s post hoc tests to allow multiple group comparisons.
Survival curve statistical analysis was performed using the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test.
When comparing two groups to each other, a Student’s t-test (unpaired, 2-tailed) was
performed.
Groups were considered significantly different when P < 0.05. The relevant calculated P
values are reported in Supplementary Information, where detailed statistical information for
each experiment can also be found.
Ultrasound tumour monitoring

HHMI Author Manuscript

Tumours were identified and dimensions and volume were measured as previously described
using high-resolution ultrasound (Vevo 770)29. Briefly, mice were anaesthetized using 3%
isoflurane, and abdominal fur was removed using fine clippers and depilatory cream. Prewarmed sterile saline (100–200 μl) was administered via intraperitoneal injection.
Ultrasound gel was applied over the abdominal area and the ultrasound transducer was used
to identify abdominal landmark organs (liver/spleen) followed by the pancreas and the
tumour. Once identified, the transducer was transferred to the 3D motor stage and a 3D scan
was performed for measurement of tumour dimensions and volume. Tumour volumes were
contoured as described29.
Trypan blue-exclusion assays
To determine cell viability in starved conditions, cells were plated in complete medium at
50% confluency. Once the cells were attached, medium was replaced with serum-free
DMEM. 48 h later, cells were trypsinized, re-suspended in their own medium, diluted in
trypan blue (Thermo-scientific 15250061) and counted using a haematocytometer. The
percentage of dead cells was determined by trypan blue incorporation.
Xenografts

HHMI Author Manuscript

Xenograft studies were performed as described previously14. Briefly, 2 × 105 8988T or
MiaPaCa2 cells were either injected alone or co-injected into the flanks of nude female mice
at 6 weeks of age (Taconic ncrnu-f) with 1 × 106 hPSCs previously infected with shGFP,
shATG5 or shATG7 shRNAs under protocol 10-055. Tumour take was monitored visually
and by palpation bi-weekly. Tumour diameter and volume were calculated based on caliper
measurements of tumour length and height using the formula tumour volume =(length ×
width2)/2. Animals were considered to have a tumour when the maximal tumour diameter
was over 2 mm.
For syngeneic orthotopic injections, black6 female mice at 12 weeks of age (Taconic
B6NTac), pre-conditioned with doxycycline diet and kept in doxycycline regimen for the
duration of the experiment, were injected in the pancreas with 1 × 105 iKRAS mPDAC cells
isolated from a pure black6 PDAC GEMM (KrasG12D, P53 L/+)15 either alone or co-

injected with 5 × 105 mPSCs that were previously infected with shGFP, shATG5 or shATG7
shRNAs (or mPSC–shGFP was used alone as a negative control). Briefly, an incision was
made on the flank, above the spleen. The spleen was identified and gently pulled out through
the incision to expose the pancreas. 10 μl of cell suspension containing 20% of Matrigel
(BD-Biosciences 354234) was injected in the tail of the pancreas using a Hamilton syringe
that was held in place for 30 s to allow Matrigel polymerization. The spleen and pancreas
were carefully re-introduced in the animal and the peritoneum sutured. The wound was
clipped with surgical staples and the animals were allowed to recover for 1 week until the
beginning of weekly ultra-sound monitoring of tumour take and progression.
Human PDAC orthotopic injections were performed in a similar way, by injecting 5 × 105
MiaPaCa2 and/or 1 × 106 hPSC #1 infected with shGFP, shATG5 or shATG7 shRNAs into
the tail of the pancreas of nude female mice (Taconic ncrnu-f) at 8 weeks of age. Animals
were considered as tumour-positive when a mass detected in the pancreas reached a volume
of at least 1 mm3 as calculated by 3D ultrasound. All animal studies were not blinded or
randomized. Studies were performed under DFCI IACUC protocol # 10-055, where the
maximal tumour size allowed is less than 2 cm.

a, 1 mM U-13C-Ala labelling of 8988T cells for 24 h shows incorporation of alanine carbon
into the TCA cycle metabolites citrate (Cit), isocitrate (Iso), fumarate (Fum), malate (Mal)
and NEAAs, aspartate and glutamate, derived thereof. These data are presented in Fig. 2 as
fractional labelling (Fig. 2e) and as the percentage of the citrate pool incorporating the label
(Fig. 2f). M0 refers to an unlabelled metabolite with no heavy carbons (unlabelled
isotopomer, 12C), M1 is an isotopomer with one heavy (13C) carbon that can be in any
position in the molecule, M2 is a metabolite with any two heavy carbons (13C), M3 with 3
and so on. The maximal M for a given species represents the fully 13C labelled isotopomer
(for example, for citrate that has a 6-carbon skeleton, it would be M6). In the schematic
illustration, U-13C-Ala is represented as three red balls, each depicting a labelled carbon
atom. This is converted into U-13C-Pyr (M3) and shuttled into the mitochondria. The
conversion of U-13C-Pyr to Ac-CoA results in the loss of one carbon as CO2. Ac-CoA is
then added to oxaloacetate (OAA) to form 2-13C labelled citrate (M2). This citrate traverses
around the TCA cycle and is metabolized into the other TCA cycle metabolites. The carbon
labelling patterns are indicated with red (labelled) and white (unlabelled) balls. αKG, αketoglutarate; Succ, succinate. b–e, Contribution of alanine and pyruvate to TCA cycle
metabolites citrate (b), isocitrate (c), fumarate (d) and malate (e) as shown by U-13C-Ala
and U-13C-Pyr tracing in 8988T cells in medium containing 10 mM glucose and 2 mM
glutamine. f–k, Contribution of alanine to TCA cycle metabolites citrate (f), isocitrate (g),
fumarate (h) and malate (i) as well as the NEAAs Glu (j) and Asp (k) is independent of
glucose concentration in the medium, as shown by U-13C-Ala tracing in medium containing
0.5 mM, 10 mM or 25 mM glucose. Data are presented as total ion currents; error bars
represent the s.d. of n =3 technical replicates from independently prepared samples from
individual wells. The raw data for b–k are presented in Supplementary Information Fig. 2a–

carbon so that it can fuel other biosynthetic processes

HHMI Author Manuscript

a, The addition of alanine to PDAC cells labelled with U-13C-glucose significantly increases
the unlabelled citrate, with a corresponding reduction in the labelled (M2) citrate. A t-test
was performed; ***P =0.0009, *P =0.0169. b–c, Alanine is a meaningful source of carbon
for the de novo biosynthesis of the free fatty acids palmitate (b) and stearate (c) in two
PDAC cell lines. The sum of the isotopomers from these data are presented in Fig. 2g, h. d–
g, The addition of alanine to PDAC cells labelled with U-13C-glucose reduces glucose
carbon incorporation into palmitate in 8988T (d) and Tu8902 (e) cells as well as into stearate
in both 8988T (f) and Tu8902 (g) PDAC cells. This is shown by a decrease in highly
enriched species (M14, M16 for palmitate and M16, M18 for stearate) and an increase in
less enriched species (M6, M8, M10 for palmitate and M6, M8, M10, M12 for stearate). h,
U-13C-glucose tracing studies illustrate that alanine drives glucose carbon into the serine
biosynthetic pathway, as demonstrated by significant increases in fully labelled (M3),
glucose-derived 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG), 3-phosphoserine (p-Ser), serine (Ser), and M2
glycine. A t-test was performed; *P = 0.0355 for 3PG (Ala) versus control; ***P = 0.0041
for p-Ser (Ala) versus control; *P = 0.0172 for Ser (Ala) versus control; *P = 0.0123 for Gly
(Ala) versus control. i, j, Alanine increases serine biosynthetic pathway activity, as seen for
changes in the precursors 3PG and p-Ser. This effect is enhanced in cells grown under low
glucose (0.5 mM) conditions (j). A t-test was performed; i, *P =0.0355, ***P =0.0041; j,
***P = 0.0005 for 3PG Ala versus mock, P < 0.0001 for pSer Ala versus mock. k, l, Alanine

ATG5 or ATG7 knockdown attenuates the ability of PSC- (hPSC#1)-conditioned medium to

for hPSC-shGFP versus hPSC-shATG5; P = 0.0040 for hPSC-shGFP versus hPSC-shATG7.

for shGFP versus shATG5, P =0.0003 for shGFP versus shATG7, P = 0.0001 for shGFP

a, hPSC-conditioned medium does not significantly affect proliferation of 8988T cells
grown in complete medium (25 mM glucose, 4 mM Gln, 10% serum). Alanine
supplementation contributes modestly to PDAC growth in complete medium. Error bars
represent the s.d. of 6 replicate wells from a representative experiment (of 4 experiments).
One-way ANOVA; **P =0.0079. b, c, hPSC #2 or hPSC #3-conditioned medium can sustain
in vitro proliferation over 48 h for 8988T (b) and Tu8902 (c) cells, as compared to PDACconditioned medium. Data are normalized to growth in serum-free DMEM and complete
serum medium is included as a positive control. Error bars represent s.e.m of n = 4

experiments) for c. One-way ANOVA; b, ***P < 0.0001; c, **P =0.0091, ***P < 0.0001. d,
hPSC-conditioned medium facilitates proliferation of 8988T cells grown in low glucose (0.5
mM) medium. Conditioned medium from hPSCs in which autophagy is inhibited loses the
ability to support PDAC growth. Supplementation of medium with exogenous alanine
rescues PDAC proliferation under low glucose conditions in a manner akin to the positive
control, 10 mM glucose-containing medium. Error bars represent the s.e.m of 4 independent
experiments. One-way ANOVA; *P = 0.0420 for GFP versus control, P = 0.0158 for
complete medium versus control; **P =0.0054. e–g, hPSC#1-conditioned medium increases
PDAC proliferation in MiaPaCa2 (e), Tu8902 (f) and 8988T (g) cells in serum-free medium.
Conditioned medium from hPSCs in which autophagy is inhibited is less effective at
maintaining PDAC proliferation. Alanine increases PDAC proliferation under serum-free
conditions, and it can rescue the proliferation-inducing capacity of autophagy-deficient

over 48 h in serum-free conditions. This effect is impaired when the conditioned medium is
collected from mouse PSCs in which autophagy is inhibited. Error bars represent s.e.m of n

pyruvate, but not by 1 mM lactate in 8988T (j), Tu8902 (k) and MiaPaCa2 (l) PDAC cell

Figure 4. Stellate cell metabolite secretion supports PDAC growth under nutrient-limiting
conditions and facilitates tumour growth

HHMI Author Manuscript

a, PSC-conditioned medium increases proliferation of 8988T cells grown in serum-free
medium, a feature recapitulated with exogenous alanine supplementation. By contrast,
conditioned medium from PSCs where autophagy is inhibited is unable to support PDAC
growth. The addition of 10% serum is included as a positive control. Error bars, s.e.m. (n
=7) independent experiments. b, c, Co-injection of 8988T PDAC cells with PSCs
significantly enhances early tumour growth, analysed at 35 days post-injection (b), and
decreases tumour-free survival (c), in a xenograft model. This effect is significantly
attenuated when autophagy is suppressed in the PSCs. Error bars, s.e.m. (n = 10) tumours
per condition per time point, except for the PSC–shGFP control, for which (n = 5) animals
were injected. d, e Co-injection of inducible KRAS mouse PDAC cells with mPSCs in the
pancreas of syngeneic mice significantly enhances early tumour growth at 7 days postinjection (d) and decreases tumour-free survival (e) in an orthotopic syngeneic graft model,
whereas this effect is significantly attenuated when autophagy is suppressed in the PSCs.
