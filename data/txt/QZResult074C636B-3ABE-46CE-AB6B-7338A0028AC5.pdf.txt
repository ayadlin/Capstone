Abstract
BCL6 is a transcriptional repressor that recognizes DNA target sequences similar to those recognized by
signal transducer and activator of transcriptions 5 (Stat5). BCL6 disrupts differentiation of breast epithelia,
is downregulated during lactation, and is upregulated in poorly differentiated breast cancer. In contrast,
Stat5a mediates prolactin-induced differentiation of mammary epithelia, and loss of Stat5 signaling in human breast cancer is associated with undifferentiated histology and poor prognosis. Here, we identify the
mammary cell growth factor prolactin as a potent suppressor of BCL6 protein expression in human breast
cancer through a mechanism that requires Stat5a, but not prolactin-activated Stat5b, MEK-ERK, or PI3KAKT pathways. Prolactin rapidly suppressed BCL6 mRNA in T47D, MCF7, ZR75.1, and SKBr3 breast cancer
cell lines, followed by prolonged reduction of BCL6 protein levels within 3 hours. Prolactin suppression of
BCL6 was enhanced by overexpression of Stat5a but not Stat5b, was mimicked by constitutively active
Stat5a, but did not require the transactivation domain of Stat5a. Stat5 chromatin immunoprecipitation
demonstrated physical interaction with a BCL6 gene regulatory region, and BCL6 transcript repression
required histone deacetylase activity based on sensitivity to trichostatin A. Functionally, BCL6 overexpression disrupted prolactin induction of Stat5 reporter genes. Prolactin suppression of BCL6 was extended to
xenotransplant tumors in nude mice in vivo and to freshly isolated human breast cancer explants ex vivo.
Quantitative immunohistochemistry revealed elevated BCL6 in high-grade and metastatic breast cancer
compared with ductal carcinoma in situ and nonmalignant breast, and cellular BCL6 protein levels correlated negatively with nuclear Stat5a (r = −0.52; P < 0.001) but not with Stat5b. Loss of prolactin-Stat5a
signaling and concomitant upregulation of BCL6 may represent a regulatory switch facilitating undifferentiated histology and poor prognosis of breast cancer. Cancer Res; 70(4); 1711–21. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Prolactin regulates growth and differentiation of breast epithelia during pregnancy and lactation (1, 2). Prolactin activates the prolactin receptor–associated Jak2 tyrosine kinase
and downstream signaling proteins, including signal transducer and activator of transcription-5a (Stat5a) and Stat5b
(3). Stat5a and Stat5b have 92% amino acid identity and share
many characteristics, but are encoded by distinct genes that
vary in tissue expression and display subtle differences in
phosphoregulation and DNA binding (3). Upon tyrosine phosAuthors' Affiliations: 1Department of Cancer Biology, Kimmel Cancer

phorylation of a conserved motif, Stat5 proteins form stable
homodimers and heterodimers that translocate to the nucleus and bind to target DNA sequences. Prolactin activates both
Stat5a and Stat5b in mammary epithelia of pregnant and lactating rodents (1, 4) and in many human breast cancer cell
lines (5). Nonetheless, Stat5a null mice have a more pronounced lactational deficiency than Stat5b null mice (1, 6).
Studies in mice indicate that prolactin promotes mammary tumor initiation and growth via Stat5a (7–14). Several other prolactin-responsive signaling pathways have also been
implicated in breast cancer growth and progression, including MEK-ERK, PI3K-AKT, and AP-1 pathways (11, 15–17). Evidence has also implicated prolactin and Stat5 in the
maintenance of cell differentiation and suppression of invasive characteristics in breast cancer (18–21). Basal activation
of Stat5 in healthy human breast epithelia is frequently lost
in invasive and metastatic human breast cancer (19). Indeed,
loss of active Stat5 in breast cancer correlated with poorly
differentiated histology and poor prognosis (19, 22–24). Thus,
a working model has been proposed in which prolactin-Jak2Stat5 signaling promotes mammary tumor initiation but
also maintains differentiation and suppresses progression
of established breast cancer (25).

The proto-oncogene B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/
lymphoma 6 (BCL6) is a master regulator of B-lymphocyte
development and facilitates proliferative expansion and
blocks differentiation into plasma and memory cells (26).
BCL6 is a zinc-finger protein and a potent transcriptional repressor (27). Intriguingly, the BCL6 consensus DNA-binding
sequence resembles that of Stat5, and BCL6 competes for
binding to many Stat5 DNA interaction sites (28–30). Emerging evidence points to a tumor-promoting role of BCL6 in
breast cancer. First, BCL6 protein is elevated in human
breast cancers, especially in high-grade, poorly differentiated
cases (31, 32). Second, BCL6 is expressed in mouse mammary
epithelia, primarily in virgin and pregnant animals, but
is completely suppressed during lactation, a terminal
differentiation stage that coincides with peak activation of
Stat5a and Stat5b (33). Third, overexpression of BCL6 in
immortalized mouse mammary EpH4 cells blocked cellular
differentiation and promoted proliferation, supporting a
differentiation-suppressive role of BCL6 in mammary epithelial
cells (32).
Both negative and positive regulation of BCL6 by Stat5 has
been reported. Stat5 suppressed BCL6 expression in B-cell
lymphomas, adipocytes, and hepatocytes (28, 34, 35), but
stimulated BCL6 in B lymphocytes (36) and in insulin-producing β-cells during pregnancy (37). A recent gene-profiling
study of breast cancer cells indicated that prolactin inhibited
expression of BCL6 mRNA, an effect that could be mimicked
by a constitutively active Stat5a mutant (38). However, the
study did not determine whether prolactin affected BCL6
protein levels or whether Stat5b or other prolactin pathways
were involved. In fact, exposure of mammary epithelial cells
to prolactin-containing differentiation media increased BCL6
mRNA but not protein (32). The present study provides novel
evidence that prolactin effectively suppresses BCL6 protein
and mRNA levels in human breast cancer through a mechanism that depends on Stat5a but not prolactin signaling via
the Stat5b, MEK-ERK, or AKT pathways. The data are supported by experimental studies of prolactin-responsive human breast cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo, as well as
patient tumors ex vivo. In addition, correlative studies on a
progression series of archival human specimens representing
normal and malignant breast tissues further supported the
conclusions.

Materials and Methods
Tissue culture. T47D, SKBr3, ZR75.1, and MCF7 cells
[American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)] and surgical
human breast tissue explants were cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1 mmol/L
sodium pyruvate. MDA-MB-231 cells (ATCC) and HEK293
cells (Invitrogen) were grown in DMEM containing 10%
FBS and 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate. Recombinant human
prolactin (AFP795) was provided by Dr. A.F. Parlow (National Hormone and Pituitary Program, Torrence, CA). Confluent, serum-starved SKBr3 cells were incubated with
DMSO, 10 μmol/L U0126 (Signagen), 10 μmol/L LY294002

(Signagen), or 500 nmol/L trichostatin A (TSA; Sigma) for
1 h before prolactin stimulation.
Luciferase assay. The BCL6 promoter gene construct
(pGL3-BCL6-pr) was generated by PCR using BCL6-pr-f and
BCL6-pr-r primers (Supplementary Table S1) to amplify the
BCL6 regulatory region B of the BCL6 gene (34), digested with
KpnI and HindIII and cloned into pGL3 vector. For BCL6
reporter assays, stably transfected T47D cells (T47D-BCL6pr) were generated by cotransfecting pGL3-BCL6-pr and
pcDNA3 (to provide neomycin selection; 10:1 ratio), and individual cell clones were selected with G418 (500 μg/mL). For Stat5
target gene reporter assays, T47D cells (1.5 × 10 5 ) were
transiently cotransfected with either β-casein (39) or CIS
(40) genomic reporter constructs and pCMV-SPORT6-BCL6
or pCMV-SPORT6 (Open Biosystems). After 12 h, cells were
serum-starved in RPMI without FBS for 16 h and subsequently incubated with or without human prolactin
(10 nmol/L) for 24 h. MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded at
1 × 10 5 /24-well and transfected with combinations of
0.3 μg of DNA constructs for β-casein reporter (39), CIS reporter (40), pcDNA3-hPRLR (41), pCMV-SPORT-BCL6, and
pXM-Stat5a. Transfections were equalized for total DNA
with pcDNA3 empty vector. After 24 h, cells were incubated
with vehicle control or prolactin (10 nmol/L) in DMEM containing 10% horse serum. Luciferase assays were performed
24 h after prolactin stimulation (BMG PolarStar Optima luminescence reader; BMG Technologies).
Lentiviral and adenoviral vectors. Lentivirus was produced in HEK-293 cells cotransfected with lentiviral vectors
carrying short hairpin RNAs (shRNA; Open Biosystems) for nontarget control (SHC002), Stat5a [RHS-4533-NM-003142:
TRCN0000019305 (5a2), TRCN0000019306 (5a3)], or Stat5b
[RHS-4533-NM12448: TRCN0000019356 (5b3), TRCN0000019358
(5b6)], along with pCMV-dR8.2.dvpr and pCMV-VSV-G (Addgene
cdx8454 and 8455; ref. 42). SKBr3 cells (4 × 106/T25) were infected with individual lentivirus and incubated for 48 h before
exposure to prolactin. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot and quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR)
analyses. Stat5a, Stat5b, Stat5a-710F, and Stat5a-Δ713 adenovirus preparations were prepared using double cesium chloride centrifugation (43) and used for gene delivery into
SKBr3 cells (4 × 106/T25; multiplicity of infection = 5). After
24 h, cells were incubated with or without prolactin
(10 nmol/L) in the absence of FBS for another 24 h and subsequently harvested for qRT-PCR analysis.
T47D xenograft tumors. T47D xenotransplants were performed as previously described (39). Briefly, nude mice implanted with 17β-estradiol pellets (0.72 mg; Innovative
Research of America) were injected s.c. with 5 × 106 T47D
cells into two dorsolateral sites. Once tumors averaging 0.5
cm had formed, mice were injected s.c. with either vehicle
control (n = 10) or 5 μg/g body mass of human prolactin
(n = 10) every 12 h for 48 h. Tumors were harvested and processed for immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. Confluent SKBr3 cells
serum starved for 16 h were treated with or without prolactin (10 nmol/L) for 1 h and exposed to 1% formaldehyde for
5 min. Reactions were terminated with 0.125 mol/L glycine.

Stat5a Inhibits BCL6 Expression in Breast Cancer

Cells were lysed in lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH
8.0), 10 mmol/L EDTA, 1% SDS] for 1 h and subsequently
sonicated for 10 seconds (10×) on ice. Lysates were incubated with binding buffer [0.1% SDS, 1.1% Triton-X 100, 167
mmol/L NaCl, 16.7 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.1)] with a panStat5 antibody (N20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at
4°C, followed by capture with protein A–Sepharose (Amersham) for 1 h. Samples were washed with binding buffer
and resuspended in 100 μL of TE before immunoblot and
qRT-PCR analyses.
Quantitative RT-PCR. qRT-PCR assays were performed
with RNA isolated from cell lines and primary human breast
tissues using RNeasy kit (Qiagen). cDNA was generated using
Iscript (Bio-Rad). Both cDNA and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) DNA were subjected to quantitative PCR using
corresponding primers (Supplementary Table S1).
Immunoblotting. T47D and SKBr3 cell lysates were
immunoprecipitated with 4 μL of rabbit Stat5a or Stat5b
antibodies as described (39). Proteins were resolved by
SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with mouse pY-Stat5 (AX1,
1:10,000; Advantex), rabbit Stat5a (1:3,000), or rabbit Stat5b
(1:1,500) antibodies followed by secondary horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit
antibodies, respectively. BCL6 expression was detected in
whole cell lysates with BCL6 antibody (1:1,000; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) followed by secondary HRP-conjugated
anti-rabbit antibody. Densitometric analyses were performed
using Chemidoc scanner and Quantity One software (BioRad) on three independent experiments.
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry and
AQUA analyses were performed on sections containing either
xenotransplant tissues or a tissue array constructed by cutting edge matrix assembly containing 140 deidentified breast
carcinoma specimens [ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), primary invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC; grades 1–3), and
lymph node metastases] and 40 normal breast tissues (Supplementary Data). Immunohistochemistry was performed as
described previously (44) using Stat5a (Advantex, 1:8,000),
Stat5b (Advantex, 1:4,000), pY-Stat5 (Epitomics, 1:200), and
BCL6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:50). AQUA analysis was
performed using AQUA/PM2000 (HistoRx; ref. 45). Briefly,
slides were scanned and fluorescent images were captured
in three channels (FITC/Alexa-488, Cy5, or 4′,6-diamidino2-phenylindole). AQUA scores for Stat5a, Stat5b, pY-Stat5,
and BCL6 represent average signal intensities within the epithelial cell compartment as defined by cytokeratin-positive
mapping.

Results
Prolactin suppresses BCL6 protein and mRNA levels in
breast cancer cell lines. BCL6 protein levels in lysates of
SKBr3 and T47D human breast cancer lines decreased rapidly within 3 hours of prolactin stimulation, whereas levels remained unchanged in untreated cells (Fig. 1A). By 6 hours
and throughout the 48-hour time course, levels of BCL6 protein in both cell lines were markedly suppressed in the continued presence of prolactin. In parallel, levels of pY-Stat5

www.aacrjournals.org

increased rapidly following prolactin receptor activation
and remained elevated. Densitometry on four independent
experiments confirmed the inverse relationship between
pY-Stat5 and BCL6 proteins in breast cancer cells (Fig. 1B).
Prolactin suppression of BCL6 protein levels in T47D and
SKBr3 was associated with reduction in mRNA levels as revealed by qRT-PCR. BCL6 transcript levels were repressed as
early as 1 hour of prolactin stimulation and reached maximum repression by 3 hours in both cell lines (Fig. 1C). In contrast, cytokine-inducible SH2 (CISH) mRNA, an established
prolactin-stimulated gene (46), was markedly induced by
prolactin in both SKBr3 and T47D cells (Fig. 1C). Marked inhibitory effect by prolactin on BCL6 mRNA levels was also
observed in ZR-75.1 and MCF7 cells (Fig. 1D), suggesting a
broad negative regulation by prolactin of BCL6 expression
in human breast cancer lines. The rapid suppression of
BCL6 transcript levels by prolactin is consistent with the
∼30-minute half-life of BCL6 mRNA (34).
Prolactin suppression of BCL6 is dependent on Stat5a
but not Stat5b, MEK/ERK, or AKT pathways. BCL6 mRNA
and protein expression were examined in SKBr3 cells treated with vehicle or prolactin in the presence of MEK inhibitor U0126 or AKT inhibitor LY294002. Cells exposed to
neither inhibitor displayed marked prolactin suppression
of BCL6 and stimulation of CISH mRNA, effects that were
not affected by MEK or AKT inhibitors (Fig. 2A, top). The
two inhibitors were effective as judged by inhibition of prolactin-induced phosphorylation of ERK or AKT, but did not
affect prolactin suppression of BCL6 protein levels as indicated in a representative protein blot and densitometric
analyses of repeat experiments (Fig. 2A, middle and bottom,
respectively).
To examine the requirement of Stat5 signaling for prolactin-induced BCL6 repression, shRNA sequences that targeted
either Stat5a (shRNA-5a2) or Stat5b (shRNA-5b6) or a nontarget control shRNA were introduced into SKBr3 cells by
lentiviral delivery, and cells were subsequently treated with
prolactin for 6 hours. Selective knockdown of Stat5a significantly reversed both prolactin suppression of BCL6 mRNA
levels and stimulation of CISH mRNA expression, whereas selective knockdown of Stat5b did not (Fig. 2B, top). Prolactin
suppression of BLC6 protein levels was also reversed by
shRNA-5a2 as well as to a lesser but statistically significant
extent by a second independent Stat5a-targeted shRNA,
shRNA-5a3 (Fig. 2B, middle and bottom). Two shRNA constructs, 5b3 and 5b6, targeting Stat5b effectively knocked
down Stat5b but did not affect prolactin suppression of
BCL6 protein, consistent with mRNA data (Fig. 2B, middle
and bottom).
Conversely, overexpression of Stat5a but not Stat5b in
SKBr3 cells using adenoviral gene delivery suppressed basal
levels of BCL6 and further enhanced prolactin suppression of
BCL6 (Fig. 2C, top). The lack of efficacy of Stat5b could not be
attributed to differences in expression (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Furthermore, Stat5a-Δ713, which lacks the transactivation domain, retained the ability to mediate prolactin
suppression of BCL6 (Fig. 2C, bottom left). Stat5a-Δ713 acts
as a dominant-negative mutant for transactivation function

and suppressed both basal and prolactin-induced CISH transcript levels (Fig. 2C, bottom right). Importantly, Stat5a-Δ713
was at least as effective as Stat5a in enhancing prolactin suppression of BCL6 mRNA levels. Finally, the constitutively active Stat5a-S710F mimicked prolactin suppression of BCL6 in
the absence of prolactin and further suppressed BCL6 in response to prolactin (Fig. 2C, bottom left). In conclusion, prolactin suppression of BCL6 could be reversed by knockdown
of Stat5a but not Stat5b or by disruption of MEK-ERK or AKT
pathways.
Prolactin-activated Stat5 directly binds and functionally inhibits the BCL6 regulatory region by a TSA-sensitive
mechanism. Stat5 ChIP assays in SKBr3 cells revealed prolactin-inducible Stat5 binding to the exon I region of the

1714

BCL6 gene (region B), which contains four adjacent canonical GAS (IFN-γ-activated Sequence) sites (Fig. 3A) previously shown to be regulated by Stat5 in B-cell lymphoma
lines (34). Anti-Stat5 ChIP and qPCR revealed that capture
of the BCL6 response region almost exclusively occurred
when Stat5 was activated, although Stat5 protein was
captured equally well in cell lysates from prolactin-treated
or untreated cells (Fig. 3B). In fact, activation of Stat5
was associated with >10-fold enrichment for BCL6 DNA
(Fig. 3C). Likewise, the genomic promoter region of CISH,
a known Stat5 target gene, was also significantly enriched
upon Stat5 immunoprecipitation in prolactin-treated cells,
but not the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH)–negative control DNA.

Stat5a Inhibits BCL6 Expression in Breast Cancer

To test whether the interaction between Stat5 and the
BCL6 regulatory sequence was associated with transcriptional repression of BCL6, a genomic BCL6 luciferase reporter
was generated that contained the regulatory region B with

the four GAS sites (34). When tested in transient transfection
assays, prolactin consistently stimulated this reporter gene
(data not shown), in agreement with previous analysis of this
regulatory genomic element in isolation outside of chromatin

context (34). However, when stably transfected into T47D
cells, 2 of 10 clones consistently showed prolactin repression
of the BCL6 luciferase reporter gene by ∼50% (Fig. 3D),
whereas the other clones did not respond to prolactin (data
not shown). This observation suggested that prolactin repression of BCL6 is dependent on chromatin context and
may require additional cofactors. In fact, prolactin-induced
repression of BCL6 required HDAC activity as revealed by reversal upon pretreatment of cells with TSA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor that inactivates HDAC class I and II (ref. 47;
Supplementary Fig. S2). In the absence of TSA, prolactin effectively inhibited BCL6 mRNA expression, stimulated expression of CISH, and derepressed the BCL6 target gene,
BLIMP1 (26). TSA effectively blocked prolactin repression of
BCL6 but did not affect basal levels of BCL6 (Supplementary
Fig. S2A and S2B). Consistent with the histone deacetylase
(HDAC) requirement for prolactin repression of BCL6, the associated prolactin derepression of the BCL6-target gene,
BLIMP1 (26), was also sensitive to TSA (Supplementary Fig.
S2C). In contrast, prolactin stimulation of CISH mRNA levels
remained intact (Supplementary Fig. S2D), a result consistent
with the lack of requirement for HDAC for transcriptional
activation by Stat5 of CISH. Collectively, ChIP assays and
the reporter gene analyses provided evidence of direct involvement of Stat5 in occupying the regulatory region of

1716

Cancer Res; 70(4) February 15, 2010

the BCL6 gene and suggested critical involvement of HDAC
activity for gene suppression.
BCL6 interferes with Stat5-induced gene transcription.
Whereas Stat5a suppressed BCL6 protein expression, BCL6
conversely interfered with prolactin-Stat5 signaling in breast
cancer. Overexpression of BCL6 in T47D cells completely
blocked prolactin-induced expression of β-casein and CIS reporter gene constructs (Fig. 4A and B), indicating that BCL6
effectively disrupts at least some of the Stat5-induced genes
in breast cancer cells. Stat5a induction of β-casein and CIS
reporter genes was also disrupted by BCL6 in MDA-MB-231
breast cancer cells. Because our MDA-MB-231 cells do
not express appreciable levels of prolactin receptor or
Stat5, prolactin receptor and Stat5a cDNAs were also cotransfected. Overexpression of BCL6 completely blocked
prolactin-induced expression of both Stat5 target genes in
MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4C). We conclude that BCL6 disrupts
prolactin induction of Stat5-regulated reporter genes in both
T47D and MDA-MB-231 cells.
Prolactin inhibits BCL6 expression in human breast
cancer in vivo and ex vivo. We tested whether BCL6 expression was suppressed by prolactin in vivo using T47D xenotransplants and ex vivo using freshly isolated explant
cultures of human surgical breast cancer tissues. For xenotransplant experiments, T47D tumor-bearing mice were

treated with either PBS control (n = 10) or human prolactin
(n = 10) for 48 hours. Immunohistochemistry revealed an inverse relationship between levels of nuclear pY-Stat5 and cellular BCL6 protein in xenotransplant tumors (Fig. 5A).
Without prolactin treatment, Stat5 was inactive and BCL6
expression was detectable in the majority of T47D tumor
cells. In contrast, tumors in prolactin-treated animals displayed high levels of nuclear pY-Stat5 and markedly reduced
BCL6 protein levels. In addition, qRT-PCR analysis showed
high levels of BCL6 transcripts in untreated control tumors
and at least 4-fold reduction of BCL6 transcripts in prolactin-stimulated tumors, consistent with the observed in vitro
prolactin suppression of BCL6 (Fig. 5B). Conversely, control
tumors expressed low levels of CISH mRNA that were stimulated up to 8-fold by prolactin treatment.
Human primary breast cancer tissue explants in shortterm ex vivo cultures were also examined, extending the effect
of prolactin on BCL6 to more clinically relevant conditions.
Human breast cancer tissue explants from two patients
were exposed ex vivo to either vehicle or prolactin for 1 hour
before being subjected to immunohistochemical or qRTPCR analyses. Specimen 1 responded to prolactin by increased levels of pY-Stat5 (Fig. 5C), whereas specimen 2

had no detectable pY-Stat5 in response to prolactin. qRTPCR assays revealed that prolactin suppressed BCL6 expression >2-fold in prolactin-responsive specimen 1 but not in
prolactin-unresponsive specimen 2 (Fig. 5D). Consistent
with Stat5 activation, CISH mRNA was stimulated 2-fold by
prolactin in specimen 1 but not in specimen 2 (Fig. 5D).
Collectively, these data further extended prolactin suppression
of BCL6 expression in human breast cancer to both in vivo and
ex vivo conditions.
Cellular levels of BCL6 protein are negatively correlated
with levels of nuclear-localized Stat5a but not Stat5b in
human breast cancer tissues. A breast cancer progression
array containing 40 normal and 140 malignant breast tissues, including DCIS, IDC, and metastases, was analyzed
by automated quantitative immunohistochemistry (45) for
levels within the epithelial compartment of cellular BCL6
protein, nuclear-localized pY-Stat5, nuclear-localized Stat5a
protein, and nuclear-localized Stat5b protein (Fig. 6A–C).
Overall, whereas cellular levels of BCL6 increased, levels of
nuclear-localized pY-Stat5 gradually decreased over the
progression series from normal breast to metastatic lesions
(Fig. 6B, left). A weak negative correlation between levels of
BCL6 and nuclear-localized tyrosine phosphorylated Stat5
(r = −0.23, P < 0.014; Fig. 6B, right) was observed in the clinical specimens. However, when Stat5a and Stat5b proteins
were analyzed separately, a strong negative correlation was
observed between levels of cellular BCL6 and nuclear Stat5a
(r = −0.52, P < 0.001) but not with nuclear Stat5b (Fig. 6C).
Instead, a weak positive correlation was noted between
cellular BCL6 and nuclear Stat5b (r = 0.27; P = 0.006). The
observed selective negative correlation between cellular
BCL6 and nuclear Stat5a but not Stat5b is consistent with
the observed selective mechanistic role of Stat5a in prolactin suppression of BCL6 based on the in vitro cell line data.

The present study provides novel evidence of prolactin
suppression of BCL6 protein levels in human breast cancer
and suggests a mechanism that selectively involves Stat5a despite robust parallel activation of Stat5b, ERK, and AKT by
prolactin in breast cancer cell lines. Prolactin inhibited
BCL6 protein expression through rapid suppression of
BCL6 mRNA, an effect that could be reversed by shRNAmediated suppression of Stat5a but not Stat5b. A strong negative correlation between protein levels of cellular BCL6 and
nuclear Stat5a, but not Stat5b, in a progression material of
normal and malignant breast tissues supported the selective
role of Stat5a as a suppressor of BCL6, as suggested by the
in vitro data and provided clinical relevance to the observations. Furthermore, several lines of evidence indicated that
the effect was mediated by repressor activity and direct binding of Stat5a to regulatory elements in the BCL6 gene based
on (a) ChIP, (b) rapid reduction of BCL6 mRNA levels within
minutes of Stat5a activation, (c) requirement for HDAC activity as determined by sensitivity to TSA, and (d) the lack of
requirement for the transactivation domain of Stat5a. Furthermore, a genomic BCL6 DNA fragment containing the

Stat5a Inhibits BCL6 Expression in Breast Cancer

Stat5-binding elements coupled to a luciferase reporter gene
could restore Stat5-dependent repression when stably transfected into breast cancer cells. However, repression seemed
to be chromatin context dependent because not all of the
stably transfected clones revealed repression. Finally, functional involvement of BCL6 as a direct negative regulator
of Stat5-induced gene transcription supported the concept
that elevated BCL6 may enhance the effects of reduced Stat5
signaling during breast cancer progression.

The observation that shRNA targeting of Stat5a but not
Stat5b reversed prolactin suppression of BCL6 suggests a
unique repressor capacity of prolactin-activated Stat5a that
is not mimicked by prolactin-activated Stat5b in breast cancer cells. Although Stat5a and Stat5b generally recognize the
same primary GAS sites (3), the greater ability of Stat5a to
form N-domain–dependent tetramers on tandem GAS sites
(48) provides one possible Stat5a-selective mechanism. Further analyses are therefore needed to map in detail which of

the regulatory GAS sites of the BCL6 gene are required for
Stat5a-mediated repression of BCL6, whether Stat5a preferentially binds to this region, and to identify the exact molecular complexes responsible for prolactin suppression of BCL6
mRNA. The transcriptional corepressor SMRT can bind to
the coiled-coil domain of Stat5a and Stat5b activated by interleukin-3 and provide repressor functions (49), and future
work will determine the requirement for SMRT for prolactindependent repression of BCL6.
Previously, the observed loss of nuclear-localized, tyrosine
phosphorylated Stat5 protein in invasive breast cancer was
associated with poor prognosis and raised the possibility that
Stat5 inhibits cell invasion and metastasis. In established
breast cancer, active Stat5 is associated with more differentiated histology and experimental evidence suggests that
Stat5a promotes differentiation and suppresses invasive features (19, 20, 23). Our present results demonstrating that
prolactin-activated Stat5a negatively regulates BCL6 expression provide a new mechanism by which Stat5 may control differentiation of normal and malignant breast epithelia. BCL6
functions as a tumor-promoting factor by blocking differentiation and stimulating cell cycle progression in lymphomas.
Consistent with this action, poorly differentiated and rapidly
growing breast cancers exhibited elevated levels of BCL6 protein. Overexpression of BCL6 in the mammary cell line EpH4
inhibited cellular differentiation and promoted growth by increasing cell proliferation and reducing apoptosis (32, 50). Correspondingly, in the present study, overexpression of BCL6 in
breast cancer cell lines abolished prolactin-induced expression of Stat5 reporter genes β-casein and CIS. Ongoing studies
will address the impact of BCL6 for prolactin regulation of
breast cancer cell biology in vitro and in vivo.

In summary, the present work has revealed a novel negative regulatory interaction placing the proto-oncogene BCL6
within the prolactin-Jak2-Stat5a signaling network in human
breast cancer. The resulting upregulation of BCL6 may
exacerbate the biological consequences associated with loss
of Stat5a signaling in breast cancer due to the suppressive
effect of BCL6 on Stat5 target gene induction. Further work
is now warranted to determine the diagnostic and therapeutic implications for human breast cancer of the mutually
negative crosstalk between Stat5a and BCL6 signaling.
