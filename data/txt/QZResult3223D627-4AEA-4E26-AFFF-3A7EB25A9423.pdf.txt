BACKGROUND: The combination of cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and cetuximab is a standard treatment for patients with recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancer, with a high rate of toxicity. Identifying less toxic, equally effective regimens is imperative. Therefore, in
the current study, the authors investigated first-line treatment with an all-oral regimen of capecitabine and lapatinib. METHODS:
Patients were required to have incurable head and neck cancer of any primary site other than the nasopharynx, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 to 2, and no prior exposure to capecitabine or lapatinib. Subjects were
treated with capecitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 twice daily and lapatinib at a dose of 1250 mg daily. Capecitabine was administered for 14 days of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles. Lapatinib was administered daily until disease progression. The primary outcome
was overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 44 subjects were accrued between November 13, 2009 and April 29, 2014. Approximately
38.6% of the sample had an ECOG PS of 0, 52.3% had an ECOG PS of 1, and 9.1% had an ECOG PS of 2. Approximately 81.8% were
male and the median age of the patients was 62 years. Prior attempts at curative treatment with chemotherapy had been used in
68.2% of patients (platinum was used in 55.8%). There was no grade 5 toxicity noted (toxicity was graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 3.0]). The most common adverse events were diarrhea (18.2%
of patients with grade 3) and rash (13.6% of patients with grade 3). The primary objective was met; the median overall survival was
10.7 months (90% confidence interval [90% CI], 8.7-12.9 months). The overall response rate was 25% (90% CI, 15%-38%). The median
progression-free survival was 4.2 months (90% CI, 3.6-5.1 months). The results were not substantially different when subdivided by
p16 status. Only 2 patients were positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 by immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSIONS:
The current study met its primary objective of survival comparable to the combination of cisplatin, 5-FU and cetuximab regimen, and

INTRODUCTION
Recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer (R/M HNSCC) remains incurable in the vast majority of cases.
Cisplatin-containing regimens have been the standard treatment platform for >20 years. The most recent advance was the
addition of cetuximab to a cisplatin-containing or carboplatin-containing regimen, which increased the overall survival
(OS) from 7.4 months to 10.1 months compared with chemotherapy alone.1 To the best of our knowledge, the Erbitux in
First-Line Treatment of Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer (EXTREME) regimen of cisplatin, 5-FU and
cetuximab represented the first significant breakthrough in the treatment of R/M HNSCC, but it came at a price. Adverse
events (AEs) in both treatment arms of the EXTREME trial were significant; 76% of patients receiving 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and platinum experienced grade 3 to 4 adverse events, and 82% of patients receiving cisplatin, 5-FU, and cetuximab
experienced grade 3 to 4 adverse events.
Other limitations of current chemotherapy regimens for R/M HNSCC include the need for an infusaport for continuous 5-FU administration and anaphylaxis associated with cetuximab (especially in the southeastern United States, in
which the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions approaches 20%2,3). Finally, many patients with R/M HNSCC have

already received cisplatin-based or carboplatin-based
chemotherapy or cetuximab during induction and/or concurrent chemoradiation, thereby making these medications less effective for palliative therapy. Therefore,
alternative first-line regimens with improved toxicity and,
ideally, better efficacy are needed for the treatment of
patients with R/M HNSCC.
Capecitabine is the oral pro-drug of 5-FU. At the
time the current study was designed, the Grupo Espanol
de Tratamiento de Tumores de Cabeza y Cuello (TTCC)
had evaluated capecitabine in patients with cisplatinrefractory disease and demonstrated a time to disease progression of 4.8 months and an OS of 7.3 months.4
Lapatinib is an orally administered agent that inhibits
both human epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (HER1)
(epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]) and HER2; it
is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in
combination with capecitabine for the treatment of HER2overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.5,6 HER2 is an
orphan receptor: it lacks a ligand-binding domain and it
dimerizes with other members of the Erb family, including
EGFR (ErbB1/HER1), leading to downstream signaling.7
HER2 overexpression has been associated with an adverse
prognosis in patients with HNSCC. Data available at the
time of the design of the current study indicated frequent
overexpression of HER2 in HNSCC.8 Lapatinib also offers
practical advantages in that unlike cetuximab, it is an oral
agent and does not cause allergic reactions. Both capecitabine and lapatinib can be administered, if necessary,
through a gastrostomy tube. We sought to determine the
efficacy and tolerability of the all-oral regimen.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review
Boards at participating sites, which included the University
of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania Hospital, Pennsylvania Presbyterian Hospital, and the University of North Carolina. A
medical monitor provided ongoing safety monitoring.
Patients

Eligibility stipulated incurable R/M HHSCC. All primary mucosal head and neck sites other than the nasopharynx were allowed. Prior chemotherapy delivered with
curative intent was permitted (eg, as a component of
induction chemotherapy or concurrent chemoradiation,
or as adjuvant therapy), but patients may not have
received prior capecitabine or lapatinib. No prior chemotherapy in the noncurative setting was permitted. An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
(ECOG PS) of 0 to 2 was required. Laboratory stipulaCancer

tions at study entry included an absolute neutrophil count
1500/mm3, platelet count 100,000/mm3, total bilirubin <2, albumin >2.5, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 5.0 times the institutional upper
limit of normal for patients with hepatic metastases or
3.0 times the institutional upper limit of normal for
patients without hepatic metastases, and a glomerular filtration rate >30 (by the standard Cockcroft-Gault formula). Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was required
to be at least 50%. Washout periods of 4 weeks were
required for prior cetuximab therapy and 14 days for prior
radiotherapy. 5-FU as part of curative therapy was not
permitted within 6 months of study entry.
Protocol Treatment

Lapatinib was administered orally at a dose of 1250 mg
daily at least 1 hour before or after the morning meal every
day of each 21-day cycle. Capecitabine was administered
orally on a full stomach at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 twice per
day for the first 14 days of each 21-day cycle. For patients
with a glomerular filtration rate between 30 and 50, the
capecitabine dose was reduced to 850 mg/m2 daily.
Instructions were provided for the safe administration of
both medicines via gastrostomy tube, if required.
Full information regarding dose adjustments is included
in the protocol (see online Supporting Information). Left ventricular EF was monitored every 12 weeks using either echocardiogram or multigated acquisition scan. Any decrease in
the left ventricular EF of >20% was reevaluated 1 to 2 weeks
later while the patient was still receiving lapatinib; if the repeat
EF confirmed a sustained decrease of >20% and the resulting
EF fell below the institutional limit of normal, then lapatinib
was withheld until recovery. Specific management guidelines
for diarrhea were provided, including the avoidance of
lactose-containing products, encouragement of adequate oral
hydration, consumption of small frequent meals, and liberal
use of loperamide. For patients with diarrhea that was not
adequately responsive to these maneuvers, therapy was withheld, and diphenoxylate/atropine and octreotide were considered. Specific dose reduction guidelines were provided for
diarrhea, rash, hand-foot syndrome, and abnormal liver function tests. Dose reduction and dose omissions for other toxicities were based on National Cancer Institute Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0) grades
and number of recurrences of a given toxicity.
Study Assessments

Imaging of involved disease sites was obtained every 6
weeks during treatment. Cytotoxic therapy was limited to

which patients with stable disease or response could
receive maintenance therapy with lapatinib until disease
progression. After 24 weeks, patients with an objective
response or stable disease could, at the discretion of the
treating physician, increase the interval of imaging to every 9 weeks. Tumor measurements were based on
Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors
(RECIST), version 1.0. p16 positivity was defined by at
least 70% of the tumor cells demonstrating nuclear reactivity. A positive result for HER2 was defined as any staining (at least 11).
Statistical Analysis

The study was designed with OS as the primary outcome
with the goal of detecting an increase in the median OS
from 6.6 months9 to 9.3 months with 80% power and a
significance level of .1. An interim analysis for futility was
performed after 9 subjects had been enrolled and evaluated for disease progression; 8 achieved disease control
(defined as complete response, partial response, or stable
disease) and therefore the study continued to full enrollment. Descriptive statistics for the study variables were
produced, including median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables and frequency and percentage for categorical variables. AEs were
tabulated by type and grade. With a total of 44 subjects,
there was a probability of 90% to detect any unforeseen
AE occurring with an incidence of at least 5.1%. The
overall response rate and disease control rate were computed with the 90% exact confidence interval (90% CI)
using binomial distribution. OS was defined as the
months between the initiation of the treatment and the
date of death or was censored at the date of last patient
contact. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the
number of months between the initiation of the treatment
and the date of death or disease progression, whichever
occurred first or censored at the date the patient was last
seen. OS and PFS distributions were estimated using the
Kaplan-Meier method, and 90% pointwise confidence
bounds were displayed. Exploratory subgroup analyses
were performed by p16 positivity; the combination of
p16 positivity, oropharynx site, and smoking status; and
by HER2 status. Statistical analysis was performed using
Stata statistical software (version 14; StataCorp LP, College Station, Tex).

and oral cavity were the predominant primary tumor sites,
occurring in 39% and 30% of patients, respectively. The
tumors of 14 patients were positive for p16; of these, 10
patients had an oropharyngeal primary tumor, 2 had a

Adverse events were reported if they occurred in at least 10% of patients
at any grade, in at least 5% at grade 3, or if there were any grade 4 occurrences. There were no grade 5 adverse events reported.

was grade 3; and infection, which was observed in 15.9%
of patients (6 with grade 3 and 1 patient with grade 4).
Hand-foot syndrome occurred in 18.2% of patients, all of
which were grade 1 to 2. Mucositis occurred in 31.8% of
patients and was grade 3 to 4 in 9.1%. No instances of
congestive heart failure were observed (Table 2).
The response rate (RR) was 25% (90% CI, 15%38%). Two patients achieved a complete response and 9
patients achieved a partial response; 4 patients were not
evaluable for response and were counted as nonresponders. The disease control rate, defined as the RR plus stable
disease, was 68% (90% CI, 55%-80%). The median PFS
was 4.2 months (90% CI, 3.6-5.1 months) (Fig. 1) and
the median OS was 10.7 months (90% CI, 8.7-12.9

pharyngeal primary tumor and p16 positivity, the RR was
60%, PFS was 6.5 months, and OS was 18.8 months.
Only 2 patients had tumors that were found to be positive
for HER2 by immunohistochemistry. One patient had
stable disease, a PFS of 5.5 months, and an OS of 5.5
months. The other patient developed progressive disease,
and had a PFS of 1.4 months and an OS of 9 months.
DISCUSSION
With a median survival of 10.7 months (90% CI, 8.712.9 months), the current study met its primary objective
of an OS of at least 9.3 months in a population of patients
with R/M HNSCC that included patients with an ECOG
PS of 2. The demographics shown in Table 1, including
the Charlson Comorbidity Index, are not consistent with
the selection of favorable-risk patients. This survival result
is comparable to the OS of 10.1 months obtained in the
experimental arm of the EXTREME study of cisplatin, 5FU, and cetuximab. Comparisons with the RR and PFS
data from the EXTREME study are less favorable; the RR
2353

Original Article

in the EXTREME study was 36% and the PFS was 5.6
months.
The toxicity of the regimen was mostly favorable
compared with the toxicity in either arm of the
EXTREME study. Hematologic toxicity was substantially
milder; grade 3 to 4 neutropenia occurred in 22% of
patients in the EXTREME study and anemia in 13%,
whereas in the current study only a single patient (2.3%)
experienced grade 3 to 4 levels of either toxicity. In the
EXTREME study, approximately 11% of patients experienced grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia and 9% had grade 3
to 4 leukopenia; no patient experienced either toxicity in
the current study. One toxicity that was found to increase
in the current study was diarrhea, which occurred at grade
3 to 4 in 18.2% of patients compared with <5% in the
EXTREME study. The study protocol defined a diarrhea
management strategy, including dose reductions and antidiarrheal regimens (see online Supporting Information
for the full protocol). Some patients value the demedicalization of life and convenience offered by an all-oral (or
gastrostomy tube) regimen.10 Unfortunately, to the best
of our knowledge, standard quality-of-life instruments do
not measure this potential improvement in quality of life.
Because we did not attribute the favorable survival
results to patient selection or to the activity of lapatinib,
an alternative hypothesis is required. By 1 year, the chance
of a patient having progressive disease was estimated to be
95%, yet the 1-year and 2-year OS probabilities were
42% and 22%, respectively. We hypothesize that the
favorable toxicity profile of the regimen increased the feasibility of subsequent therapy. Although the lack of data
regarding the results of subsequent therapy limits the ability to assess this hypothesis, we believe that the 74% rate
of receiving subsequent therapy was at least supportive.
Future research regarding cytotoxic therapy should
address whether concurrent multidrug regimens are
required to optimize survival or whether the serial administration of active agents can provide similar survival with
less toxicity.
The PFS curves from the current study are nearly
superimposable with those reported in another study of
previously treated patients who received single-agent
capecitabine.4 A phase 2 study of single-agent lapatinib in
patients with R/M HNSCC yielded a RR of 0%,11 suggesting an absence of activity. The tumors of only 2
patients in the current study were found to overexpress
HER2, and even in these 2 patients, neither experienced a
response. Data published subsequent to the design and
conduct of the current study have shown substantially
lower rates of HER2 overexpression in patients with
2354

HNSCC,7,12,13 and the results of other clinical studies of
dual EGFR and HER2 inhibitors have not found an
improvement in survival.14,15 Although recently published preclinical data have suggested that lapatinib is
more active against human papillomavirus-driven disease,16 the small amount of data from the subgroup of
patients with p16-positive disease cannot add clinical support to this finding. A major weakness of the study design
was a lack of biologic enrichment.
The combination of the all-oral regimen of capecitabine and lapatinib appeared to be reasonably well tolerated and resulted in favorable survival. Although the
current study did meet its primary endpoint, we do not
believe that this regimen warrants further study in unselected patients.
