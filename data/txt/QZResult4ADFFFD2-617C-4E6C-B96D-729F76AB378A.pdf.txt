ABSTRACT
Taxol is a mitotoxin widely used to treat human cancers, including of the
breast and ovary. However, taxol resistance (txr) limits treatment efficacy in
human patients. To study chemoresistance in ovarian cancer, we established txr
ovarian carcinoma cells derived from the SKOV3 cell lineage. The cells obtained
were cross-resistant to other mitotoxins such as vincristine while they showed
no resistance to the genotoxin cisplatin. Transcriptomic analysis identified 112
highly up-regulated genes in txr cells. Surprisingly, FK506-binding protein 5
(FKBP5) was transiently up-regulated 100-fold in txr cells but showed decreased
expression in prolonged culture. Silencing of FKBP5 sensitized txr cells to taxol,
whereas ectopic expression of FKBP5 increased resistance to the drug. Modulation
of FKBP5 expression produced similar effects in response to vincristine but not to
cisplatin. We observed that a panel of newly identified txr genes was trancriptionally
regulated by FKBP5 and silencing of these genes sensitized cells to taxol. Notably,
immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that FKBP5 forms a protein complex
with the androgen receptor (AR), and this complex regulates the transcriptional
activity of both proteins. Furthermore, we found that the Akt kinase pathway is
regulated by FKBP5. These results indicate that the FKBP5/AR complex may affect
cancer cell sensitivity to taxol by regulating expression of txr genes. Our findings
suggest that mitotoxin-based treatment against ovarian cancer should be avoided
when the Akt/FKBP5/AR axis is activated.

of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and solute carrier
(SLC) families play a major role in these phenomena.
Probably the most important ABC protein in this context
is glycoprotein P (P-gp), which is encoded by the abcb1
gene (multidrug resistance protein 1, or MDR1) [3]. This
protein is a drug efflux pump that can actively remove
nearly 20 different drugs from the cell. It is expected
that at least 10 additional ABC proteins are involved
in drug resistance [4]. Structural advances in this field
have provided a framework to decipher the kinetic and

INTRODUCTION
The taxanes paclitaxel (taxol) and docetaxel are
microtubule-stabilizing agents that function primarily by
interfering with spindle microtubule dynamics, ultimately
causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. These agents have
become widely recognized as active chemotherapeutic
agents for the treatment of various human cancers.
However, their therapeutic efficacy is limited by inherent
or acquired resistance [1, 2]. Membrane transporters

molecular mechanisms by which ABC transporters
couple ATP hydrolysis to substrate translocation [5].
Another group of membrane transporters involved in
drug resistance is the SLC transporters, which function
mainly as influx transporters [6]; these transporters
are often downregulated in chemoresistant cells [7–9].
Despite recent advances in this field, no valid biomarkers
exist to predict resistance to taxanes in breast cancer [1].
Overexpression of MDR-1/P-gp and altered expression of
microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), including tau,
stathmin, and MAP4, may help identify the patients who
are at risk of recurrence and the ones most likely to benefit
from taxane treatment [2]. Gene set enrichment analysis
(GSEA) is a statistical methodology for determining
whether a given gene set is significantly associated
with a phenotype of interest [10, 11]. GSEA has been
successfully used to identify metabolic pathways altered
in many diseases, including to identify that activation
of the PI3K/Akt pathway is associated with incomplete
metabolic response in cervical cancer [12].
PI3K is activated by growth factor signaling through
both Ras and receptor kinase signaling. One of the early
events in Akt activation is the recruitment of PIP3 to
the cellular membrane. Akt becomes fully activated by
phosphorylation at two sites, S473 and T308. In contrast,
the phosphatases in the PH domain and leucine-rich repeat
protein phosphatases (PHLPP) family have been shown
to directly dephosphorylate and therefore inactivate
distinct Akt isoforms. FKBP5 functions as a scaffolding
protein that brings PHLLP closer to the Akt S473 site and
facilitate the dephosphorylation of S473, which in turn
downregulates Akt signaling [13]. The protein kinase Akt
regulates cellular survival [14] and metabolism by binding
and regulating many downstream effectors. Furthermore,
Akt is frequently activated in human cancers and has been
implicated in resistance to chemotherapy.
FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) belongs to a
family of immunophilins that exhibit peptidylprolyl
cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) activity [15, 16]. FKBP5,
a target for drugs such as rapamycin and tacrolimus
(FK506), binds proteins such as Akt and the progesterone
receptor (PR) at FKBP-type domains. FKBP5 also binds
the androgen receptor (AR), glucocorticoid receptor
(GR), phosphatase PHLPP, and chaperone Hsp90 through
tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains. FKBP5 is involved
in several signaling pathways, including hormone signaling,
irradiation-induced NF-κB activation, and chemotherapyinduced Akt-PHLPP pathways, exerting important roles in
cancer development and chemoresistance [17]. Although
FKBP5 shares many characteristics with other FK506
binding proteins (FKBPs), it also has unique features, such
as regulating important signaling pathways (e.g., Akt) [13].
FKBP5 is highly expressed in multiple tissues. Previous
studies showed that upregulation of FKBP5 is associated
with drug resistance in various cancers (including breast,
prostate, myeloma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

melanoma) following treatment with antineoplastic agents
(FK506, rapamycin, dexamethasone, irradiation) [18–23].
These studies involved NF-κB or hormone signaling. In
contrast, Wang and colleagues used genome-wide screening
to demonstrate that FKBP5 levels are inversely associated
with response to two cytidine analogues, gemcitabine and
cytosine arabinoside [24]. Furthermore, downregulation of
FKBP5 desensitized pancreatic and breast cancer cell lines
to several classes of chemotherapeutic agents, including not
only cytidine analogues but also taxanes, irinotecan, and
etoposide [24, 25]. These findings can be explained by the
regulatory mechanisms affecting Akt kinase activity which
are also involved in regulating chemosensitivity [26].
By influencing Akt phosphorylation, FKBP5
cellular levels may affect sensitivity to chemotherapy.
However, the actions of FKBP5 on NF-κB activation or
hormone induction could not explain the increased level
of chemoresistance in cells showing reduced FKBP5
expression, suggesting the existence of other mechanisms
by which FKBP5 may regulate cell survival. FKBP5
expression can be induced by activation of AR, GR, and
PR [27]. Both overexpression and downregulation of
FKBP5 have been observed in human cancers. FKBP5 has
been shown to either promote or suppress tumor growth
through its regulation of different signaling pathways in
specific tissue environments [17].
Considering that taxanes are important
chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of cancers, we
are trying to determine the mechanism of taxol resistance
(txr) in order to optimize the use of these drugs during
cancer treatment. Using a microarray analysis, we
searched for new candidate genes in SKOV3-derived txr
cell lines in order to identify txr biomarkers. Among the
txr genes identified, FKBP5 is the most notable since it
is highly upregulated early during development of txr,
but show reduced expression in prolonged culture. To
our knowledge, this study is the first report revealing
that FKBP5 plays a role in survival signaling and taxol
response in ovarian cancer.

RESULTS
FKBP5 modulates cell response to mitotoxins
but not to genotoxins
Transcriptomic profiling revealed that FKBP5
mRNA was highly up-regulated in txr cells (the DNA
microarray data were deposited into the GEO database;
GSE60335). Surprisingly, up-regulation of FKBP5 was
nearly lost after prolonged culture (12 months; GSE58878
containing the subseries GSE58840 and GSE58877).
Accordingly, FKBP5 expression was dramatically
reduced in prolonged culture of txr cells as measured
by qPCR (Fig. 1A). We examined the kinetic change of
FKBP5 gene expression during early response to taxol

(challenged every other day). The mRNA level measured
by qPCR was slightly induced after taxol treatment
(1 nM), reaching a peak at day 1 and declining thereafter
to non-induced level. Although a second challenge with
the same concentration of taxol did not cause immediate
increase of FKBP5’s slope or peak, a third challenge led to
a large increase of FKBP5, followed by a moderate decline
(Fig. S1). These results indicate that the FKBP5 gene is
inducible and its expression increases at the early stage of
txr development, following taxol treatment. However, the
FKBP5 gene is less responsive to the drug in late culture
during selection with increasing concentration of taxol.
The level of FKBP5 was dramatically reduced in txr cells
compared to early cultures, but it still increased 10 fold
compared to non-treated cells.
To assess the role of FKBP5, we silenced this gene
using short-hairpin RNA (shRNA). FKBP5 silencing
(shFKBP5) significantly sensitized txr cells to taxol
(Fig. 1B). We examined the effects of FKBP5 silencing in
response to others chemotherapeutic drugs. While FKBP5
silencing sensitized txr cells to taxol by 9.2-fold, a 2.4-fold
sensitization effect was noted for vincristine (Fig. 1C).
Notably, silencing of FKBP5 did not affect cell response
to the genotoxin cisplatin (Fig. 1D), suggesting that
taxol-regulated genes such as FKBP5 may be regulated
differently by DNA-damaging agents.
To ensure that the sensitization effect was associated
with apoptosis, we examined caspase-3 activation using
Western blotting. In control SKOV3 cells expressing shLuc,
taxol induced cleavage and activation of caspase-3 and its
substrate, poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). Caspase-3
activation increased in taxol-treated cells following silencing
of FKBP5 (Fig. 1E). Enhanced apoptosis was also confirmed
by the significant increase of sub-G1 cells following FKBP5
silencing (see Fig. 1F for representative flow cytometry
diagrams and Fig. 1G for the corresponding quantitative and
statistical analysis; P < 0.001).
In contrast, ectopic expression of FKBP5 induced
resistance to taxol by 8.7 fold (Fig. 2A). We observed that
FKBP5 overexpression increased resistance to vincristine
by 1.8 fold (Fig. 2B). However, FKBP5 overexpression did
not significantly alter cellular response to cisplatin (Fig. 2C).
Ectopic expression of FKBP5 significantly reduced caspase
activation and sub-G1 cell accumulation induced by taxol in
SKOV3 cells (Fig. 2D-F). Taken together, these results show
that FKBP5 modulates cell response to mitotoxins.

(Fig. 3A). In contrast, while caspase-9 (mitochondrial
apoptosis pathway) was activated by taxol in a dosedependent manner, ectopic expression of FKBP5 reduced
activation of both caspase-3 and caspase-9 (Fig. 3A).
While release of cytochrome c from mitochondria
was induced by taxol, cytosolic cytochrome c levels were
reduced by FKBP5 overexpression (Fig. 3B), and the
reduction was significant at high dose of taxol (Fig. 3C).
Reduced mitochondrial Bax was also observed in FKBP5overexpressing cells (Fig. 3B and D). These results
suggest that the intrinsic, mitochondrial apoptosis pathway
is regulated by FKBP5 in ovarian cancer cells.

FKBP5 expression reduces activation of ­
pro-apoptotic mitochondrial pathways

To assess the stability of FKBP5, we performed
experiments using the translation elongation inhibitor
cycloheximide (CHX). Following CHX treatment, FKBP5
was stabilized in txr cells (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 1–4 with
lanes 5–8). Statistical analysis indicated that the stabilization
was significant (Fig. 5B; P < 0.01). Ectopic expression of
FKBP5 also stabilized AR protein level in parental SKOV3
cells (Fig. 5C and D; P < 0.001).

FKBP5 forms a protein complex with
inactivated AR
Since FKBP5 represents a scaffold protein and the
AR is upregulated in tumors and chemoresistant cancer cells
[28, 29], we examined the possibility that these proteins may
interact. Although the AR was upregulated in txr ovarian
cells (SKOV3/Tx600) compared to parental cells, FKBP5
protein levels were similar in txr and parental cells (Fig. 4A).
Nevertheless, FKBP5 mRNA was moderately upregulated
in txr cells (Fig. 4B). Consistent with the increased protein
level described above, AR mRNA was upregulated more
than 1,000-fold in txr cells (Fig. 4B).
Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments
revealed that the activated AR induced by
dihydrotestosterone (DHT) showed reduced interaction
with FKBP5 (Fig. 4C). While the level of AR increased
following ectopic expression of FKBP5, the level of
FKBP5 that precipitated with AR gradually decreased
in response to DHT treatment, suggesting that FKBP5
preferentially interacted with inactivated AR.
Activation of AR by DHT was confirmed by
increased nuclear translocation of the protein (Fig. 4D,
lanes 5–8). In this case, FKBP5 remained in the cytosol
and nucleus. Ectopic expression of FKBP5 (flag-FKBP5)
induced AR expression in non-tumor HEK293T cells
(Fig. 4E). As seen in SKOV3 cells, FKBP5 interacted
less efficiently with DHT-activated AR as revealed by­
co-IP (Fig. 4F, compare lanes 3 and 4 with 5 and 6).
These results indicate that the interaction between the two
proteins is highly affected by AR’s conformation.

Stabilization of both FKBP5 and AR in txr cells

To further assess activation of apoptotic pathways,
we examined the levels of additional pro-apoptotic proteins.
A slight activation of caspase-8 (membrane death receptor
pathway) was observed following treatment with taxol,
but caspase-8 was not affected by FKBP5 overexpression

Since protein stability is mostly regulated by
ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation, we also
analyzed the ubiquitination of AR in FKBP5-overexpressing
HEK293T cells using treatment with the proteasome
inhibitor MG132 [30]. While HEK293T cells displayed
highly ubiquitinated AR, the level of this ubiquitinated
protein was almost completely eliminated in FKBP5overexpressing cells (Fig. 5E). These results suggest that
FKBP5-induced stabilization of AR may occur through a
reduced ubiquitination of the protein. We noted that ectopic
expression of FKBP5 resulted in moderate increase of AR
in SKOV3 cells, whereas no significant increase of AR was
detected in HEK293T cells, suggesting the possibility that
higher survival signals may be present in cancer cells.

following silencing or ectopic expression of FKBP5. First,
silencing of FKBP5 considerably reduced AR protein
expression in txr cells (Fig. 6A). In contrast, ectopic
expression of FKBP5 rescued AR expression back to
control levels (Fig. 6A, compare lanes 1 and 4).
It is known that high levels of FKBP51 lead to
reduced Akt phosphorylation/activity and increased
chemosensitivity, whereas low levels of FKBP51
lead to increased Akt phosphorylation/activity and
chemoresistance of cancer cells of the prostate, breast,
and pancreas [24, 25]. On the other hand, AR stability/
activity is regulated by Akt-mediated phosphorylation
depending on cell context [31–33]. To examine the possible
link between Akt and FKBP5 in ovarian cancer cells, we
examined the levels of Akt kinase and found significant
inhibition of Akt phosphorylation or activation (pAkt)
following FKBP5 silencing (Fig. 6B). These results suggest
that FKBP5 positively regulates pAkt and AR expression
post-translationally in our system. Similarly, AR mRNA
levels were effectively suppressed by FKBP5 silencing

(Fig. 6C). In contrast, AR mRNA levels were considerably
induced by ectopic expression of FKBP5 (Fig. 6D).
To determine the significance of this alteration, we
assessed cell viability following silencing of AR or FKBP5.
Silencing of AR produced a 2.7-fold sensitization to taxol,
whereas silencing of FKBP5 sensitized the cells by 8.9fold (Fig. 6E). These results were not due to difference in
silencing efficiency (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, silencing of
both AR and FKBP5 caused a 5.4-fold sensitization to taxol,
whereas ectopic expression of FKBP5 in shAR-expressing

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells considerably reduced sensitization, producing a SF of
1.2 (Fig. 6F). These results suggest that FKBP5-regulated txr
cell response may occurs through AR expression. However,
shFKBP5 induced-sensitization to taxol is remarkably higher
than the sensitizing effect induced by shAR. In addition,
the sensitization effect of double FKBP5/AR silencing is
higher than that of single AR silencing (Fig. 6E). These
results suggest that further mechanisms, in addition to AR
upregulation, may be involved in FKBP5-regulated taxol
resistance.

overexpressed less than 10 fold) and 13 genes that were
not regulated by AR were selected and their upregulation
was confirmed by qPCR (Table 1). Eight AR-regulated
genes were upregulated following ectopic expression
of FKBP5 (Table 1; also see Fig. 7). None of the genes
that were not regulated by AR was regulated by FKBP5,
suggesting that a sub-group of txr genes may be regulated
by both FKBP5 and AR. qPCR analysis confirmed the
upregulation of these genes (Fig. 7A). FKBP5 silencing
downregulated the eight txr gene candidates (Fig. 7B). In
contrast, ectopic expression of FKBP5 upregulated these
genes by 5 to 40 fold (Fig. 7C).
Interestingly, silencing of AR also downregulated
the txr gene candidates (Fig. 7D). Furthermore, while these
genes were upregulated by activation of AR using the
synthetic androgen R1881, all of them were suppressed to
near basal level following silencing of FKBP5 (Fig. 7E),
supporting the notion that FKBP5 and AR interact and
control downstream gene expression.
Using an AR promoter reporter assay (see Materials
and methods), we observed that AR-driven promoter
activity was induced 10-fold by R1881, with a basal
level of 2.5-fold. R1881-induced AR promoter activity
was further upregulated more than 20-fold by ectopic
expression of FKBP5 (Fig. 7F).
To assess the role of the potential txr genes
identified, we selected the canonical multidrug gene
ABCB1 and a novel H1F0 for cell viability experiments.
Silencing of ABCB1 and H1F0 sensitized txr cells to
taxol by 3.1 fold and 1.7 fold, respectively (Fig. 7G).
Furthermore, silencing of BMP5 and FGFR2 resulted in
2.4-fold and 2.6-fold sensitization of txr cells to taxol,
respectively (Fig. 7H). Further experiments showed
that individual silencing of the other four FKBP5/ARregulated genes sensitized txr cells to taxol (Fig. S2).

which were present even without any treatment. While
tumor volume was the same between untreated shLuc
control and shFKBP5 groups, it was significantly reduced
in the FKBP5 silencing group following taxol treatment
(Fig. 8B; P < 0.001).
To assess the status of these tumors, FKBP5 expression
and apoptotic cells were examined. Immunohistochemistry
staining showed that FKBP5 expression was reduced in
shFKBP5 tumors treated or not with taxol (Fig. 8C, panels a,
a’, b, and b’; indicated with arrows). Apoptotic cells revealed
by activated caspase-3 expression were enhanced following
silencing of FKBP5 in taxol-treated tumors (Fig. 8C,
compare shLuc panels c and c’ and shFKBP5 panels d and
d’; indicated with arrows). Furthermore, taxol-induced
caspase activation was dramatically enhanced following
silencing of FKBP5 as revealed by Western blotting
performed on mouse tumors (Fig. 8D).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we found that FKBP5 represents
a powerful regulator or driver of gene expression
involved in txr. By comparing genome-wide expression
of genes in parental and txr ovarian carcinoma cells, we
identified over 100 genes that were overexpressed more
than 10-fold in txr cells. We found that eight txr genes
were upregulated by FKBP5/AR. Surprisingly, FKBP5
was initially upregulated over 100-fold in txr cells but
its expression was reduced following prolonged culture
as measured by DNA microarray and qPCR. FKBP5
nonetheless upregulated a sub-group of txr genes in
resistant cells. Our results confirm that FKBP5 acts as a
scaffold protein [13] that recruits AR and regulates gene
expression. Amplification of FKBP5 expression also
subsequently upregulates target txr genes such as ABCB1,
H1F0, BMP5, and FGFR. However, our current data did
not show whether FKBP5 can directly function to regulate
taxol response in ovarian cancer cells. Most of the txr
genes identified are novel associations worthy of further
studies to verify their role in regulation of txr. While the
txr genes are highly upregulated and readily detected by
transcriptome profiling, FKBP5 may have been overlooked
due to its transient upregulation at the transcriptional level.
Accordingly, we uncover a potentially hidden marker that
plays a role in the development and/or maintenance of
txr (a diagram of the pathway involved in txr is shown
in Fig. 8E).
We noted that FKBP5 protein levels were more
stable in txr cells than in parental cells. Cells in which
FKBP5 was overexpressed displayed a considerable
stabilization of the AR protein, which is a versatile
protein capable of reprogramming genomic activity in
prostate cancer and probably also in other cancers [28].

Silencing FKBP5 sensitizes mouse tumor
xenograft to taxol treatment
To assess whether the modulation effects of FKBP5
on txr exists in vivo, we used a mouse tumor xenograft
model. SKOV3 cells were implanted into severe
combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice by a two step
transplantation process due to difficulties in colonizing the
animals with this cell line. Prepared SKOV3 cells were
expanded in cell culture for silencing FKBP5 or control
shLuc. When SKOV3 cells of both groups were grown
subcutaneously to the same volume, animals were injected
with saline (untreated) or with taxol, and followed until
tumors reached ~1 cm in diameter.
Representative animals showed reduced tumor
size following silencing of FKBP5 and treatment with
taxol (Fig. 8A). We noted that the tumors were covered
by a dried tissue that may represent shrinked tumor cells,

nucleus. Both pathways eventually lead to anti-apoptotic effects or chemoresistance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Our results indicate that a normal level of FKBP5
is able to stabilize AR or lead to its accumulation in
ovarian cancer as well as in non-cancer HEK293T cells.
Interestingly, FKBP5 appears not to form a complex with
activated AR following stimulation with DHT in our cell
system. This phenomenon may be explained by the notion
that FKBP5 acts as a scaffold protein that recruits other
components in an appropriate conformation through TPR
domains [17]. Txr genes may be upregulated through
AR activity during the development of txr, as long as
FKBP5 provides the required factors [28]. This scenario
is highly possible since AR, through phosphorylation
[34] or ubiquitination/deubiquitination [35, 36] by
other proteins, may be structurally modified and this
process may regulate the transcription of target genes.
In addition to interacting with AR, FKBP5 also interacts
with other hormone-regulated receptors such as PR and
GR to regulate target genes [17]. However, a network
construction using MetaCore and the highly upregulated
genes or potential txr genes identified here did not reveal
a significant association with PR or GR (data not shown).
These results suggest that FKBP5 preferentially recruits
AR and other protein components for upregulation of txr
genes in the process of txr.
Another interesting finding reported here is that the
regulatory role of FKBP5 in chemoresistance appears to
be specific for drugs that impair mitotic functions. This
observation is supported by the lack of regulation in cells
treated with cisplatin, which mainly causes DNA damage.
Highly-overexpressed genes in cisplatin-resistant cervical
cancer cells have been identified recently, and these genes
have been found to be involved in resistance to cisplatin
[37]. Of note, we observed no overlapping between the
genes upregulated by cisplatin or taxol. The transcriptomic
profiling performed here identified genes that may be
involved in response to other mitotoxins as the txr cells
were also resistant to the mitotic inhibitor vincristine [38].
Since ABCB1 has been shown to represent an important
factor for multiple drug resistance [3], the finding that the
FKBP5/AR/ABCB1 axis plays a role in txr in ovarian
cancer cells supports the usefulness of our strategy.
Our results, although not consistent with those of
Pei et al, who showed that FKBP51 reduces pAkt levels
[25], are, instead, in line with those of Fabian AK et al,
[39] who, using mutational and pharmacological studies,
showed that FKBP inhibitors are unlikely to inhibit the
Akt-FKBP-PHLPP network.
Additional factors that interact with FKBP5
may provide an additional layer of regulation and this
regulation may be cell-type dependent. Our findings
strongly suggest that regulation of txr genes by FKBP5
is specific to the drug used. Identification of unique
txr genes may provide important markers for the
development of new cancer treatments based on single or
multiple drug(s).

Cell lines and reagents
SKOV3 cells (American Type Culture Collection,
Rockville, MD, USA) were grown as monolayers in a 1:1
mixture of DMEM/nutrient F-12 Ham (Life Technologies,
Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 1% (w/v)
penicillin/streptomycin and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum
(FBS) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5%
CO2. The chemotherapeutic drugs used included cisplatin,
taxol (paclitaxel), and vincristine (Bristol-Myers Squibb,
New York, NY, USA). MG132 and cycloheximide were
purchased from Calbiochem/Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).
The other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA). All reagents were used according to
the instructions provided by the supplier.

Establishment of cell lines with acquired
resistance to taxol
Taxol-resistant ovarian cancer cells were obtained
from the parental, drug-sensitive, ovarian cancer cell
line SKOV3 by administrating taxol in a conventional
dose-escalation manner. The concentration of taxol
was increased stepwise, starting at 10 nM and finishing
at 600 nM. Parental SKOV3 cells were first exposed
to 10 nM taxol for two months followed by exposure
to stepwise double concentrations of taxol for a further
two months of treatment. Chemoresistant cell lines were
maintained in selective medium containing the taxol
concentration used for selection of resistance. The cells
were cultured in taxol-free medium for one week before
further studies. Episodic determinations of inhibitory
concentration 50% (IC50) values confirmed that taxolresistant phenotypes were stable for at least two months
in drug-free medium.

Cell viability
Cell growth inhibition were determined using
the in vitro MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,
5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide] colorimetric method
as previously described [40]. IC50 of cell viability was
defined as the levels that caused 50% reduction in the cell
viability treatment versus the DMSO control. Resistance
factors (RF) or sensitization factors (SF) were calculated
based on IC50 ratios to express the levels of resistance or
sensitization.

Real time q-PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted with the Trizol reagent
(Life Technologies) as previously described [41]. RNA
concentrations were assessed using spectrophotometry and

values were calculated from adjusted log 2 ratios and were
used to select differential expression genes. The primary
data was deposited into the GEO database (GSE58878
containing subseries GSE58840, GSE58877, and
GSE60335). Gene network analysis was performed using
the MetaCore software (Thomson Reuters, Philadelphia,
PA, USA).

Plasmids, transfection, cell extracts, and
immunoblot analysis
The pSG5-AR AR-expressing plasmid used in
these experiments was provided by Dr Hsiu-Ming Shih,
Academia Sinica, Taiwan). Preparation of cell samples
and procedures of Western blotting were performed
as described before [37]. Fifty μg of protein sample
was separated on a 10% sodium dedecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel [42] and electro-blotted onto
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore,
Bedford, MA, USA). After electroblotting, the membranes
were incubated in 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered
saline/Tween 20 (0.1 M Trizma base, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05%
Tween 20, pH 7.4) for blocking and with the primary
antibody raised against the following proteins: cleaved
caspase-3, Akt, phosphor-Akt (Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, MA, USA), AR, GAPDH (FL-335), FKBP5
(H-100), β-actin, Bax (N-20), PARP (H-250) (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Membranes were
incubated with secondary antibodies: goat anti-mouse
or goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (Amersham,
Buckinghamshire, UK). Resulting protein signals were
visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence based on the
specifications of the supplier (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).
Protein band intensity was determined by scanning X-ray
films through a scanning densitometer (GS 300, Hoefer,
Holliston, MA, USA).

DNA microarray
Fluorescent RNA targets were prepared from 2.5 μg
total RNA isolated from parental SKOV3 and taxolresistant derivative cells using the OneArray Amino
Allyl aRNA Amplification Kit (Phalanx Biotech Group,
Hsinchu, Taiwan) and Cy5 dyes (GE Healthcare, Little
Chalfont, UK). Fluorescent targets were hybridized
to the Human Whole Genome OneArray v5.1 which
contains 30,275 DNA oligonucleotide probes (HOA5.1,
Phalanx Biotech Group, Hsinchu, Taiwan) with Phalanx
hybridization buffer and system. After 16 hrs of
hybridization at 50°C, non-specific binding was washed
away using three different washing steps (wash 1, 42°C for
5 mins; wash 2, 42°C for 5 mins and 25°C for 5 mins; wash
3, rinse 20 times). The slides were dried by centrifugation
and scanned using an Axon 4000B scanner (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Cy5 fluorescent intensity
of each spot was analyzed using the GenePix Pro 4.1.1.44
software (Molecular Devices). Repeat experimental
data were tested with the Pearson correlation coefficient
calculation to check reproducibility (R value > 0.975).
Signal intensity of each spot was transferred to the Rosetta
Resolver System (Rosetta Biosoftware, Seattle, WA, USA)
for data analysis. The error model of the Rosetta Resolver
System removed both systematic and random errors.
Spots that passed the selection criteria were normalized
by the median scaling normalization method. Normalized
intensities were transformed to gene expression log 2
ratios between control and treatment groups using the
Rosetta Resolver error model adjustment. Fold change
