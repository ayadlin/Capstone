Abstract
Withaferin A (WFA) is a steroidal lactone with antitumor effects manifested at multiple levels that are
mechanistically obscure. Using a phospho-kinase screening array, we discovered that WFA activated phosphorylation of the S6 kinase RSK (ribosomal S6 kinase) in breast cancer cells. Pursuing this observation, we deﬁned
activation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK)–RSK and ETS-like transcription factor 1 (Elk1)–CHOP
(C-EBP homologous protein) kinase pathways in upregulating transcription of the death receptor 5 (DR5).
Through this route, WFA acted as an effective DR5 activator capable of potentiating the biologic effects of
celecoxib, etoposide, and TRAIL. Accordingly, WFA treatment inhibited breast tumor formation in xenograft and
mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-neu mouse models in a manner associated with activation of the ERK/
RSK axis, DR5 upregulation, and elevated nuclear accumulation of Elk1 and CHOP. Together, our results offer
mechanistic insight into how WFA inhibits breast tumor growth. Cancer Res; 74(9); 2617–29. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in
women worldwide. Despite improvements in early diagnosis,
and development of various targeted therapeutic approaches,
breast cancer–related mortality still remains at a high level.
Major limitations associated with available therapeutic
approaches are high toxicity, lower efﬁcacy, therapeutic resistance, and therapy-related morbidity. A more promising
approach seems to be the development of more effective,
nonendocrine, nontoxic therapeutic strategies using active
constitutive agents in natural products owing to their cancer
preventive as well as therapeutic potential. Historically, natural
products have played an important role in the discovery and
development of novel anticancer agents (1, 2). Withania somnifera has been successfully used in traditional ayurvedic
medicine to treat various diseases owing to its broad spectrum
pharmacologic efﬁcacy (3–5). The root extract of Withania

somnifera, is composed of 14 bioactive compounds known as
withanolides (6, 7). Withaferin A (WFA) is the most abundant
and therapeutically effective withanolide and multiple studies
have shown the anticancer activities of WFA (8–10). WFA
administration decreases mammary tumors and pulmonary
metastasis in the MMTV (mouse mammary tumor virus)-neu
transgenic model and is associated with increased apoptosis
(11) WFA-induced apoptosis involves reactive oxygen species
production (12), FOXO3a and Bim induction (8). Although
WFA effectively inhibits oncogenic transcription factors such
as Stat3 (13), resulting in growth inhibition, it is interesting to
note that WFA has also been reported to activate Notch
signaling, which plays an oncogenic role and is often hyperactive in breast cancer cells (14). Multiple other targets have
been documented for WFA action such as NF-kB, BCL2, Hsp90,
vimentin, and annexin II in various other cellular systems (15–
20); however, a complete molecular understanding of WFAmediated signaling networks in breast cancer growth inhibition is still emerging. Deciphering the key nodes of WFA action
in breast cancer is needed to establish surrogate biomarkers
for its efﬁcacy and help in clinical development of this bioactive
molecule, an issue, we addressed by systematically elucidating
the underlying mechanisms.
Because many cellular signaling events involve induced
phosphorylation of key targets, in the present study, we used
phosphokinase arrays to gain insight into the intricacies of
WFA-mediated signaling networks and discovered that WFA
induces ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) phosphorylation in breast
cancer cells. We designed this study to examine the role of RSK
and the underlying molecular mechanisms how WFA-mediated activation of RSK leads to growth inhibition of breast
cancer cells. Here, we provide strong evidence for extracellular
signal–regulated kinase (ERK)/RSK as an important mediator
in WFA-induced breast cancer growth inhibition and uncover

a novel mechanism of WFA action through activation of the
ETS-like transcription factor 1 (Elk1)/C-EBP homologous protein (CHOP) axis leading to death receptor 5 (DR5) activation.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
The human breast cancer cell lines, MCF7, MDA-MB-231,
T47D, and MDA-MB-468 were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection, resuscitated from early passage liquid
nitrogen vapor stocks as needed and cultured according to the
supplier's instructions. Cells were cultured for less than 3
months before reinitiating cultures and were routinely
inspected microscopically for stable phenotype. WFA was
procured from Calbiochem. Fluoromethyl ketone–methoxyethylamine (fmk–MEA), a speciﬁc p90-RSK inhibitor was
kindly provided by Dr. Jack Taunton (University of California
at San Francisco, Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology, San
Francisco, CA; ref. 21). U0126 and trichostatin A (TSA) were
procured from Sigma. CHOP overexpression construct was
purchased from OriGene Technologies, Inc. Wild-type and
S383A-mutant Elk1 plasmids were kindly provided by Dr.
Andrew D. Sharrocks (University of Manchester, Manchester,
UK; ref. 22). ERK plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Paul
Shapiro, University of Maryland (Baltimore, MD). Celecoxib
was obtained from LKT laboratories. TRAIL was obtained from
Millipore. Etoposide was purchased from Sigma.
Clonogenicity, anchorage-independent growth, and cell
viability assays
To perform clonogenicity assay (23), breast cancer cells were
treated with WFA as indicated for 10 days; colonies were
counted. Anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells
in the presence of WFA was assayed by colony formation in soft
agar (24). Cell viability assay was performed using a commercially available XTT Assay Kit (Roche Applied Science).
Breast tumorigenesis assay
MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-231-pLKO.1, MDA-MB-231DR5shRNA1, and MDA-MB-231-DR5shRNA2 xenografts were
generated as previously described (24), grouped in two
experimental groups (8 mice/group) and treated with intraperitoneal injections of either vehicle (10% dimethyl sulfoxide, 40% cremophor-EL, and 50% PBS) or vehicle containing
4-mg WFA (ChromaDex Inc.)/kg body weight 5 d/wk for
5 weeks. The dose and route of WFA administration were
selected from previous study documenting in vivo efﬁcacy of
WFA (8). Tumors were collected after 4 weeks of treatment;
measured, weighed, and subjected to further analysis by
immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR (RT-PCR), and Western blotting. At least four random, nonoverlapping representative images from each tumor section from eight tumors
of each group were captured using ImagePro software for
quantitation of pERK (phosphorylated-ERK), pRSK (phosphorylated-RSK), CHOP, pElk1 (phosphorylated-Elk1), and
DR5 expression. MMTV-neu mice model–mammary tumor
tissues from our previously published prevention study in
MMTV-neu mice (11) were also used to determine the

2618

expression of these proteins by Western blotting. In this
study, WFA administration resulted in a statistically significant decrease in macroscopic mammary tumor size, microscopic mammary tumor area (11). All animal studies were in
accordance with the guidelines of Johns Hopkins University
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and
University of Pittsburgh IACUC.
Phospho-antibody array analysis
Breast cancer cells were treated with WFA and the phosphoantibody array analysis was performed using the Proteome
Proﬁler Human Phospho-Kinase Array Kit ARY003 from R&D
Systems according to the manufacturer's instructions. Array
images were analyzed using the GeneTools image analysis
software (Syngene).
Subcellular fractions, immunoblotting, transfection,
RNA interference, immunoﬂuorescence, and confocal
imaging
Cellular cytosolic and nuclear fractions were prepared following previously published protocol (25). Immunoblotting
was carried out as described (26). The blots are representative
of multiple independent experiments and bar diagrams are
included showing quantitation of Western blot signals. Breast
cancer cells were transfected with ERK, CHOP, Elk1-WT, and
Elk1-S383A–mutant vectors using Lipofectamine-2000 (Invitrogen) and treated with WFA as indicated. For RNA interference, cells were transfected at 50% conﬂuency with 100 nmol/L
of control siRNA or ERK1/2 siRNA (SignalSilence) using Oligofectamine (Cell Signaling Technology). Breast cancer cells
were subjected to immunoﬂuorescence analysis as described
previously (24).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation and RNA isolation,
RT-PCR
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses were
performed using our published procedure (27). Total cellular RNA was extracted using the TRIzol Reagent Kit (Life
Technologies, Inc.). RT-PCR was performed using speciﬁc
sense and antisense PCR primers.
Stable knockdown using lentiviral short hairpin RNA
Five to six premade lentiviral DR5, CHOP and RSK short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs, and a negative control construct created in the same vector system (pLKO.1) were
purchased from Open Biosystems. Constructs were used for
transient transfections using Fugene or Lipofectamine. Paired
stable knockdown cells were generated following our previously established protocol (25).
Statistical analysis
All experiments were performed thrice in triplicates.
Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel
software. Signiﬁcant differences were analyzed using the
Student t test and two-tailed distribution. Results were
considered to be statistically signiﬁcant if P < 0.05. Results
were expressed as mean  SE between triplicate experiments performed thrice.

Withaferin A Modulates ERK/RSK and CHOP/Elk1 Axes in Breast Cancer

Results
WFA treatment inhibits clonogenicity, anchorageindependent growth of breast cancer cells and inhibits
breast tumor progression in athymic nude mice
We ﬁrst examined the effect of WFA on clonogenic potential
and anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells.
Treatment with 5 mmol/L WFA resulted in approximately
50% to 60% inhibition in clonogenicity and soft agar colony
formation, whereas higher concentrations were more inhibitory (Fig. 1A and B). Exposure of breast cancer cells to WFA led
to decreased cell viability (Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1D).
WFA-mediated inhibition of cancer cell growth is associated
with induction of apoptosis (8, 12, 17). Members of inhibitor-ofapoptosis protein family, survivin and X-linked inhibitor-ofapoptosis protein (XIAP), mainly function to suppress apoptosis by inhibiting caspases (28) and are associated with
increased aggressiveness, higher recurrence rate, and unfavorable breast cancer outcome (28–30). Decreased expression of
survivin and XIAP was observed in breast cancer cells treated

with WFA (Supplementary Fig. S2A). An induction of cleaved
PARP was observed in the presence of 5 and 10 mmol/L WFA
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). Treatment of breast cancer cells
with 5 mmol/L WFA for various time intervals showed a
decrease in XIAP expression along with an induction of PARP
cleavage (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
We further investigated the in vivo physiologic relevance of
our in vitro ﬁndings by evaluating whether WFA had inhibitory
effects on the development of breast carcinoma in nude mouse
models. Tumor growth was signiﬁcantly inhibited in the WFAtreated experimental group in comparison with the control
group (Fig. 1C). Ki-67, a nuclear nonhistone protein, is one of
the major markers of tumor proliferation (31) used as a
decision-making tool for adjuvant therapy (32). The immunohistochemical assessment of tumor proliferation showed
higher Ki-67 in the control group as compared with the
WFA-treated group (Fig. 1D and E). In our in vitro analysis,
we found that WFA modulated the expression of survivin and
XIAP in breast cancer cells. Corroborating the in vitro ﬁndings,

treatment results in suppression of tumor growth, inhibition
of cellular proliferation, and increased apoptosis in the breast
tumors.

To identify cellular signal transduction pathways involved in
WFA-induced inhibition of breast carcinogenesis, we interrogated 46 speciﬁc Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphorylation sites of 38
selected proteins using phosphoprotein arrays. Breast cancer
cells were treated with 5 mmol/L WFA for 3 hours and subjected to phospho-protein analysis. Phosphorylation level of
p90-RSK was signiﬁcantly increased in both MCF7 and MDAMB-231 cells. In addition, WFA treatment increased phosphorylation of ERK in breast cancer cells (Fig. 2A and B and
Supplementary Fig. S3). Dysregulated RSK expression or activity has been associated with several human cancers, controlling various downstream signaling pathways and modulating
cellular processes (33, 34). In contrast with the conventional

oncogenic role of RSK, multiple studies have shown RSK as a
potential tumor suppressor, a participant in p53-dependent
cell growth arrest, showing an important role in decreasing
cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis (33–35). We
further explored the molecular mechanisms how WFA activates RSK and the biologic signiﬁcance of RSK activation in
WFA-mediated inhibition of breast carcinogenesis.
WFA treatment activates p90-RSK via ERK-dependent
manner in breast cancer cells
To conﬁrm whether WFA can activate RSK as indicated by
phosphoprotein array results, and to clarify its dose- and timedependent response, we treated breast cancer cells with WFA.
Immunoblot analysis showed that phosphorylation of RSK
increased in a concentration-dependent manner in both MCF7
and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2C). Treatment of breast cancer
cells with 5 mmol/L WFA for various time intervals exhibited
striking increase in RSK phosphorylation within 30 minutes
(Fig. 2D and Supplementary Fig. S4A), whereas total RSK
remained unchanged. RSK activation is controlled by the
canonical Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway via direct phosphorylation of RSK by ERK (34). ERK itself
represents a major survival signaling pathway that promotes
cancer cell survival via inhibiting apoptosis; however, a proapoptotic role of ERK signaling has also been shown (36). Our
phosphoprotein array analysis showed elevated phosphorylation of ERK in breast cancer cells treated with WFA. Because of
these interesting attributes, we explored the effect of WFA on
ERK activation. Increased phosphorylation of ERK was
observed in response to WFA treatment as compared with
untreated cells (Fig. 2E). Breast cancer cells, treated with 5
mmol/L WFA for various intervals of time, showed that WFA
increased ERK phosphorylation within 30 minutes of WFA
treatment (Fig. 2F and Supplementary Fig. S4B). We questioned whether ERK is a key player in WFA-mediated RSK
activation and toward this end, we used ERK siRNA to silence
ERK (Fig. 2G) and then investigated its impact on WFAinduced RSK activation. Immunoblot analysis for phosphorylated RSK levels after ERK silencing and WFA treatment
showed that indeed ERK silencing inhibited WFA-induced
RSK phosphorylation (Fig. 2H and Supplementary Fig. S4C).
Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation using U0126 also resulted in
abrogation of WFA-mediated RSK activation (Supplementary
Fig. S5A). Next, we examined the importance of ERK and RSK
activation in WFA-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells
using MEK/ERK inhibitor, U0126, and RSK inhibitor, fmk–
MEA. WFA treatment resulted in elevated PARP cleavage,
indicating increased apoptotic response in breast cancer cells,
which was inhibited in breast cancer cells cotreated with
U0126 or fmk–MEA (Supplementary Fig. S5B and S5C). ERK
silencing abrogated WFA-mediated inhibition of clonogenicity
of breast cancer cells and reintroduction of ERK in ERKsilenced cells resensitized them to WFA (Supplementary Fig.
S6A). RSK inhibition using RSK–shRNA(s) (Supplementary Fig.
S6B) also rendered breast cancer cells nonresponsive to WFAmediated inhibition of clonogenicity of breast cancer cells
(Supplementary Fig. S6C). Collectively, these pieces of evidence
support the notion that RSK and ERK activation plays an

www.aacrjournals.org

important role in mediating biologic effects of WFA in breast
cancer cells.
WFA induces concomitant upregulation and nuclear
translocation of Elk1 and CHOP via the ERK/RSK
signaling axis in breast cancer cells
The ETS domain transactivation factor Elk1 is a direct target
of the MAPK pathways and phosphorylation of the Elk1
transcriptional activation domain by MAPKs triggers its activation, which further induces apoptosis and growth inhibition
(37). Phosphorylation at serine 383 plays a critical role in Elk1
activation. Increased Elk1 phosphorylation was observed within 30 minutes of WFA treatment, which was diminished after 6
hours posttreatment (Fig. 3A and B). We examined whether
WFA-induced Elk1 phosphorylation involves ERK. Indeed,
pretreatment of breast cancer cells with ERK siRNA reduced
WFA-induced phosphorylation of Elk1, indicating a direct
regulatory role of ERK (Supplementary Fig. S7A and S7B). Our
studies discovered the involvement of RSK in WFA function,
therefore, we investigated whether RSK is integral for WFAmediated Elk1 phosphorylation. RSK-speciﬁc inhibitor fmk–
MEA inhibited phosphorylation of RSK (Fig. 3C). Pretreatment
of breast cancer cells with fmk–MEA followed by WFA treatment showed that inhibition of RSK phosphorylation inhibited
WFA-induced Elk1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S7C). Phosphorylation can also affect the subcellular
localization of Ets proteins (37, 38). As evident in Fig. 3E, WFA
treatment did not affect the total expression level of Elk1 in
either cytoplasmic or nuclear fraction; however, increased level
of phosphorylated Elk1 was observed in nuclear fraction within
30 minutes after treatment, which remained elevated for
the duration of the treatment (Fig. 3E and Supplementary
Fig. S7D). Immunoﬂuorescence analysis of breast cancer cells
showed nuclear phosphorylated Elk1 in WFA-treated cells
(Fig. 3F).
Induction of apoptotic response by many pharmacologically
active compounds and anticancer drugs is achieved by activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. ER stress signaling system induces transcription of CHOP, a key proapoptotic
transcription factor that binds with other transcription factors
and induces proapoptotic genes (39). We found that WFA
increased expression of CHOP in a temporal manner with a
signiﬁcant increase observed within 30 minutes after treatment (Fig. 4A and B). To evaluate the contribution of ERK in
WFA-induced CHOP overexpression, we examined CHOP
expression after ERK silencing using ERK siRNA. Results
indicated that indeed ERK silencing abrogated WFA-induced
CHOP expression (Fig. 4C and D), suggesting the involvement
of ERK in the CHOP-stimulatory effect of WFA. Once upregulated, CHOP translocates to the nucleus and participates in
transcriptional modulation of responsive genes critical for
tumor cell apoptosis (39). Analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic
fractions from WFA-treated cells showed that WFA treatment
increased nuclear accumulation of CHOP (Fig. 4E and F).
Immunostaining of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells showed
that WFA treatment increases nuclear accumulation of
CHOP, whereas untreated cells showed predominantly cytoplasmic localization of CHOP (Fig. 4G). CHOP inhibition using

CHOP–shRNA(s) (Supplementary Fig. S8A) rendered breast
cancer cells nonresponsive to WFA-mediated inhibition of
clonogenicity of breast cancer cells (Supplementary Fig.

ﬁndings suggest that the ERK/RSK signaling axis plays an
important role in regulating upregulation and activation of
CHOP and Elk1 in breast cancer cells.
Elk1 and CHOP contribute to WFA-induced upregulation
of DR5 in breast cancer cells
DR5 is a death domain–containing transmembrane receptor
that triggers apoptotic response upon overexpression or activation by certain stimuli, including small-molecule anticancer

drugs and bioactive molecules (40, 41). We found that WFA
induced the expression of DR5 in breast cancer cells (Fig. 5A and
Supplementary Fig. S9A–S9D). The fact that DR5 promoter
contains cis-acting CHOP-like binding sequence prompted us
to explore the connection between WFA-mediated CHOP
induction and DR5 upregulation. We investigated whether
enforced overexpression of CHOP (Fig. 5B) using CHOP overexpression construct alters WFA-mediated DR5 expression.
Overexpression of CHOP in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells
increased DR5 expression potentiating the effect of WFA (Fig.
5C and Supplementary Fig. S9E). In a reciprocal approach,
CHOP was silenced using CHOP–shRNA approach (Supplementary Fig. S8A) followed by WFA treatment. Silencing of CHOP in

breast cancer cells inhibited WFA-mediated induction of DR5
expression (Fig. 5D). A recent study reported that DR5 promoter
contains a putative Elk1-binding site and mutations in this
binding site affected DR5 transactivation, suggesting a link
between DR5 and Elk1 (42). Because there was no previous
study linking Elk1 to DR5 expression in breast cancer cells, we
asked whether Elk1 was indeed involved in regulating WFAmediated DR5 expression. Transactivation potential of Elk1 is
enhanced by S383 phosphorylation (38), which is increased by
WFA (Fig. 3A and B); therefore, we focused on the key phos-

phoacceptor residue Ser383. Breast cancer cells were transfected with wild-type or phospho-deﬁcient (S383A) Elk1 constructs. Expression of wild-type Elk1 increased DR5 expression,
whereas phospho-deﬁcient Elk1 did not affect DR5 expression
(Fig. 5E). To examine whether Elk1 contributes to WFA-mediated DR5 upregulation, we transfected breast cancer cells with
wild-type or phospho-deﬁcient Elk1 constructs followed by

WFA treatment. Silencing of RSK in breast cancer cells inhibited
WFA-mediated induction of DR5 expression (Fig. 5H). In an
effort to better understand the molecular events involved in
WFA-induced DR5 expression, we used ChIP analyses to examine the recruitment of pElk1 and CHOP to the DR5 promoter.
pElk1 and CHOP were associated with the DR5 promoter in the
presence of WFA. DR5 in repressed state has been shown to be
associated with HDAC1 (43). Intriguingly, we observed release
of HDAC1 from DR5 promoter in response to WFA treatment
and a signiﬁcant increase in histone H4 acetylation, indicating
active chromatin conformation (Fig. 5I and Supplementary Fig.
S10A). Treatment of breast cancer cells with HDAC inhibitor,
TSA, resulted in increased expression of DR5 (Supplementary
Fig. S10B) supporting a functional role of HDAC1 in regulation
of DR5 expression. Taken together, these data show that WFA
induces DR5 expression in breast cancer cells through a mechanism involving CHOP and Elk1.
WFA is a potent inducer of DR5 and silencing of DR5
abrogates WFA-mediated growth inhibition of breast
cancer cells
DR5, upon induction, mediates enhancement of TRAILinduced apoptosis and contributes to apoptosis by other
small-molecule drugs (44). Using established small-molecule
DR5 inducers (TRAIL, celecoxib, and etoposide), we compared the efﬁcacy of WFA to induce DR5 expression in
breast cancer cells. It was interesting to note that WFA
treatment resulted in a greater induction of DR5 expression
in comparison with TRAIL, celecoxib, and etoposide (Fig. 6A
and Supplementary Fig. S11A). To determine whether WFA
enhances the effect of small-molecule DR5 inducers, we
treated breast cancer cells with WFA in combination with
TRAIL, etoposide, and celecoxib and assessed modulation of
DR5 expression, clonogenicity, and soft agar colony formation. Combination treatment with WFA enhanced etoposide-, celecoxib-, and TRAIL-induced DR5 expression (Fig. 6B
and Supplementary Fig. S11B) and resulted in signiﬁcantly
higher inhibition of clonogenicity and soft agar colony
formation (Fig. 6C and D). These results show that WFA is
a potent inducer of DR5 that can act as an effective bioactive
alternative to TRAIL, celecoxib, and etoposide as well as
enhance their effect when used in combination.
To directly examine the role of DR5 in WFA-mediated
growth inhibition of breast cancer cells, we used DR5shRNA
lentiviruses and puromycin to select for stable pools of MCF7
and MDA-MB-231 cells with DR5 depletion. We analyzed
pLKO.1 and DR5shRNA stable MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cell
pools for DR5 protein expression, and found that DR5 protein
expression was signiﬁcantly knocked down in DR5shRNA1–3
cells as compared with pLKO.1 control cells (Fig. 6E). WFA
increased PARP cleavage in pLKO.1 cells, whereas no change in
cleaved PARP was observed in DR5shRNA MCF7 and DR5shRNA
MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 6F). WFA treatment efﬁciently inhibited clonogenicity and soft agar colony formation of pLKO.1
breast cancer cells but not of DR5shRNA cells (Fig. 6G–I). We
further investigated the in vivo physiologic relevance of our in
vitro ﬁndings by evaluating whether DR5 is integral for the
inhibitory effects of WFA on the development of breast car-

cinoma in nude mouse models. MDA-MB-231-pLKO.1 and
MDA-MB-231-DR5shRNA1 and shRNA2 were used in the xenograft
athymic nude mice model. Tumor growth was signiﬁcantly
inhibited in WFA-treated MDA-MB-231-pLKO.1 (the vector
control group), whereas WFA was unable to inhibit tumor
growth in MDA-MB-231-DR5shRNA1 and shRNA2 groups (Fig. 6J–
L). These results showed that WFA-induced DR5 overexpression is indeed a crucial component of the signaling machinery
used by WFA in inhibiting growth of breast cancer cells.
WFA administration modulates activation of ERK/RSK
and CHOP/Elk1 axes in vivo
Our studies show that WFA treatment inhibits breast tumor
progression in vivo (Fig. 1C). We used tumor tissue from the
same experiment to determine the effect of WFA treatment on
the expression and activation of important signaling molecules. Tumors from WFA-treated mice exhibited increased
phosphorylation of ERK, RSK, Elk1 as well as higher expression
CHOP and DR5 in comparison with the vehicle-treated group
(Fig. 7A). Also, WFA-treated tumors showed transcriptional
upregulation of DR5 (Fig. 7B). Immunohistochemical analysis
showed that tumors from WFA-treated mice exhibited higher
number of tumor cells showing increased expression of pERK,
pRSK, CHOP, pELK1, and DR5 as compared with tumors from
the vehicle-treated group (Fig. 7C and D) providing physiologic
relevance to our in vitro ﬁndings. Earlier studies from our group
have shown that WFA treatment prevents mammary cancer
development in the MMTV-neu mouse model, tumor weight in
the WFA treatment group was lower by 50% in comparison
with the control group (11). Mammary tumor tissues from this
study were used to examine the ERK/RSK signaling axis and
DR5. Tumors from the WFA-treated group exhibited increased
expression of phosphorylated ERK and RSK as well as higher
expression of DR5 in comparison with the control group (Fig.
7E). Collectively, the ﬁndings presented here suggest that WFA
inhibits breast tumor progression and provide in vitro as well as
in vivo evidence for the involvement of RSK as an important
mediator, and uncover a novel mechanism of WFA action
through activation of Elk1 leading to DR5 activation.

Discussion
The realization of the ability of bioactive small-molecule
agent WFA to effectively inhibit carcinogenesis in a nontoxic,
nonendocrine manner has made this agent of potential interest
in the treatment of breast cancer and sparked a new interest in
understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms. Deciphering the key nodes of WFA action can help in establishing
surrogate biomarkers for its efﬁcacy and help in clinical development of this bioactive molecule. We found that WFA effectively inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells in vitro and in
vivo but our phosphokinase array studies led us to novel
discoveries that extend beyond the popular proliferative and
oncogenic role of certain kinases and inhibition of these kinases
by anticancer agents to achieve tumor growth inhibition. Both
p90-RSK and ERK are popularly known for their oncogenic role
but this study illustrates that WFA despite efﬁciently inhibiting
breast tumor growth, increases phosphorylation of RSK in

breast cancer cells via activation of ERK. These studies provide
an interesting mechanism by which WFA-induced ERK/RSK, in
a concerted action, results in concomitant upregulation/activation of CHOP and Elk1. We also identify WFA as a potent DR5
activator in breast cancer whose effects mimic molecular and
cell biological outcomes of ligand-dependent DR5 activation.
Mechanistically, this process is associated with recruitment of
CHOP and Elk1 to DR5 promoter, increased histone acetylation
in conjunction with clearance of histone deacetylase HDAC1. In
vivo analyses of tumor xenografts and tumors from MMTV-neu
mice provide further evidence of involvement of ERK/RSK and
CHOP/Elk1 axes and an integral role of DR5. On the basis of

these data, we provide a schematic diagram depicting a series of
events, including a feed-forward interaction of ERK and RSK,
direct involvement of CHOP/Elk1/HDAC1 in DR5 upregulation,
which is operative in WFA-induced DR5-dependent growth
inhibition of breast cancer cells (Fig. 7F).
Our studies offer the ﬁrst evidence of the ability of WFA to
activate RSK. RSK directly phosphorylates transcription factors, hence, regulating the transactivation of multiple gene
targets. RSK positively regulates diverse cellular processes,
including transformation, cell cycle, cell proliferation, cell
survival, and migration in response to various growth factors,
chemokines and other stimuli (45). RSK has been implicated in

apoptosis inhibition achieved in part by phosphorylation of
Bad, CEBPb and DAPK (34), as well as apoptosis induction via
phosphorylating Nur77 (46). We show that the ability of RSK to
mediate activation of Elk1 and CHOP leading to upregulation
of DR5 is critical to WFA outcomes in breast cancer cells. This
provides a new mechanism by which WFA can achieve effective
breast tumor growth inhibition. Also, these discoveries have
potentially important implications in regard to increasing
interest in targeting breast cancer through manipulation of
DR5.
Activation of death receptors to induce apoptosis in tumor
cells has been recognized as an effective way to therapeutically target epithelial cell–derived cancers but this notion is
marred by the toxic effects of death receptor ligands, FASL
and TNF. Over the few years, several small-molecule activators of the death receptor family have been reported with
some more potent than others (44). WFA has been shown to
sensitize TRAIL-induced apoptosis and activates DR5 expression in human renal cancer cells (Caki cells, but not in human

www.aacrjournals.org

normal mesangial cells; ref. 41). Here, we show that WFA is
more effective than three other known DR5 activators,
TRAIL, etoposide, and celecoxib, in activation of DR5 in
breast cancer cells, hence, seems to be a good candidate for
further development as an effective DR5 inducer. It is interesting to note that in recent years, many phase I and II single
agent and combination clinical trials have been conducted to
examine the efﬁcacy and safety of recombinant human
TRAIL (dulanermin; Amgen/Genentech), and the agonistic
monoclonal antibodies to DR5 [lexatumumab (Human
Genome Sciences), conatumumab (Amgen), drozitumab
(Genentech), tigatuzumab (Daiichi-Sankyo), and LBY135
(Novartis); refs. 44, 47]. Studies with these proapoptotic
receptor agonists (PARA) have been encouraging but no full
phase III studies have been performed, suggesting the need
for novel PARAs with improved properties.
Moreover, we report a novel ﬁnding that ERK activation is
important for WFA action in breast cancer cells. Generally
considered a survival signaling pathway, ERK-mediated

induction of apoptotic pathways has also been reported
(36, 48). Kinetics and duration of ERK activation are important
for these unusual effects of ERK. A transient activation of ERK
inhibits cell death (49), whereas prolonged ERK activation is
associated with the proapoptotic effect of ERK (36). WFA
induces a sustained ERK activation in breast cancer cells,
which was observed for the duration of experiment (until 24
hours). Very recently, it was reported that WFA increases ERK
phosphorylation in MCF7 and SUM159 cells (50). It is known
that the ERK protein directly phosphorylates Elk1 (38). Hence,
the ﬁnding of the involvement of ERK in regulation of WFAinduced cell death resulted in our subsequent novel ﬁnding
that WFA activates Elk1, which contributes to DR5 induction.
In our study, inhibition of ERK, RSK, or Elk1 with both smallmolecule inhibitors and siRNA- or shRNA-mediated gene
silencing abolishes WFA-mediated DR5 induction.
In conclusion, we uncovered a novel mechanism by which
WFA inhibits growth of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo,
which involves activation of RSK and ERK. We also demonstrate a feed-forward loop of ERK and RSK that results in
concurrent activation of CHOP and pElk1, their recruitment to
DR5 promoter leading to DR5 activation. Our results, thus,
demonstrate the integral role of a previously unrecognized
functional cross-talk between WFA and ERK/RSK and CHOP/
Elk1 axes in breast tumor growth inhibition. Also, our ﬁndings

may potentially open new avenues of research on the role of
WFA as a novel PARA.
