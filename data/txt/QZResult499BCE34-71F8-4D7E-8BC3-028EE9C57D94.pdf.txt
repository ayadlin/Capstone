ABSTRACT
Neurocognitive deficits are serious sequelae that follow cranial irradiation used
to treat patients with medulloblastoma and other brain neoplasms. Cranial irradiation
causes apoptosis in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus leading to cognitive
deficits. Valproic acid (VPA) treatment protected hippocampal neurons from radiationinduced damage in both cell culture and animal models. Radioprotection was observed
in VPA-treated neuronal cells compared to cells treated with radiation alone. This
protection is specific to normal neuronal cells and did not extend to cancer cells.
In fact, VPA acted as a radiosensitizer in brain cancer cells. VPA treatment induced
cell cycle arrest in cancer cells but not in normal neuronal cells. The level of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was increased and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax was reduced
in VPA treated normal cells. VPA inhibited the activities of histone deacetylase (HDAC)
and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), the latter of which is only inhibited in
normal cells. The combination of VPA and radiation was most effective in inhibiting
tumor growth in heterotopic brain tumor models. An intracranial orthotopic glioma
tumor model was used to evaluate tumor growth by using dynamic contrast-enhanced
magnetic resonance (DCE MRI) and mouse survival following treatment with VPA and
radiation. VPA, in combination with radiation, significantly delayed tumor growth and
improved mouse survival. Overall, VPA protects normal hippocampal neurons and
not cancer cells from radiation-induced cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. VPA
treatment has the potential for attenuating neurocognitive deficits associated with
cranial irradiation while enhancing the efficiency of glioma radiotherapy.

involving the central nervous system. Radiotherapy
can have negative sequelae of acute neurocognitive
deficits, especially in the pediatric population [3–5].
The pathogenesis of radiation-induced neurocognitive
deficits involves apoptosis of neuroproliferative cells in
the subgranular zone of the hippocampus, a region in
the brain vital for learning and memory [6–11]. Several
studies have demonstrated a steep, long-term decline in

INTRODUCTION
Radiotherapy, the clinical application of ionizing
radiation, is a crucial treatment option in modern cancer
therapy in addition to surgery and systemic therapy. This is
corroborated by the fact that more than 60% of all cancer
patients receive radiotherapy [1, 2]. Cranial irradiation
is commonly used for the treatment of neoplasms

subgranular neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus following
radiation exposure [11–15] and direct irradiation of the
hippocampus has been shown to result in pronounced
cognitive deficits [16]. The cognitive deficits following
hippocampal irradiation include deficits of learning,
memory, and spatial processing [17, 18]. Other areas
of the cerebrum appear to be less sensitive to the
effects of radiation [19]. Although at present there is no
pharmacological prophylaxis available for the prevention
of radiation-induced neurocognitive deficits, the drugs
memantine and minocycline are promising novel agents.
Memantine attenuated cognitive function decline after
whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in patients with brain
metastases [20]. Minocycline ameliorated cognitive
impairment induced by WBRT in animal models [21].
Valproic acid (VPA) is a short branched–chain
carboxylic acid that is an FDA approved anti-seizure
and antidepressant drug that is well tolerated and whose
toxicity profile has been extensively characterized [22].
VPA has a neuroprotective effect in the setting of
various neurological insults, including ibetinoic
acid  [23],  glutamate toxicity [24, 25], intracerebral
hemorrhage [26], ischemia [27, 28], malonate
toxicity [29], and oxidative stress [30]. The inhibition of
histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity by VPA is thought
to be involved in such neuroprotection [24–27, 31–34].
VPA inhibits both class I and II HDACs with resultant
hyperacetylation of histone H3 and H4 [35–39]. In
addition to HDAC inhibition, VPA has been shown to
have effects on the Akt/GSK3β pathway, an observation
that provides a novel facet of mechanisms involved in
the neuroprotective effects of VPA [40]. Other pathways
have also been proposed, including the induction of alphasynuclein [24], heat shock protein 70 [34], brain-derived
neurotrophic factor [41], and modulation of the JNK
pathway [42].
In addition to protecting healthy neurons, treatment
with VPA can selectively kill various cancer cell lines
including glioblastoma [43–45], erythroleukemic cells
[43], colon cancer cells [46] and prostate cancer cells [47].
The preclinical data of VPA on 19 different types of solid
cancers including glioma have been summarized [48, 49].
The mechanism of sensitization is proposed to involve
inhibition of HDAC leading to interference with the repair
of double strand DNA breaks [50–53]. VPA is also known
to inhibit cell growth in cancer cells by inducing apoptosis
and cell cycle arrest [54, 55].
GBM patients treated with VPA as an anticonvulsant
agent during treatment with radiochemotherapy have
recently drawn attention because of better outcomes of
the treatment, reviewed in [56]. Combined therapy with
VPA produced a 3-month longer overall survival (OS) as
compared with carbamazepine in patients with GBM [57].
Several recent studies have found improved OS in both
children and adults, ranging from 3–6 months by the
inclusion of VPA [48, 58–61]. It has been speculated that
the HDAC inhibitory properties of VPA could mediate the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

prolonged survival derived from radio-chemotherapy seen
in GBM patients [62].
Whole genome expression monitored by microarray
analysis of primary tumors of patients treated with VPA
showed significant up-regulation of hundreds of genes
belonging to multiple pathways. These include ribosomal
proteins, oxidative phosphorylation, MAPK signaling,
focal adhesion, cell cycle, antigen processing and
presentation, proteasome, apoptosis, PI3K, Wnt signaling,
calcium signaling, TGF-beta signaling, and ubiquitinmediated proteolysis among others [49].
In the present study, we found that VPA protected the
normal hippocampus from radiation-induced damage, while
sensitizing malignant gliomas to radiation. We analyzed
the anti-apoptotic effects of VPA administration in vitro
and in vivo and characterized the changes in intracellular
signaling and protein expression induced by administration
of VPA prior to radiation. We also determined the
radiosensitizing effect of VPA in glioblastoma cell lines,
and its effects on tumor growth delay and survival of
intracranial glioma-bearing mice using dynamic contrast
enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, DCE MRI.

RESULTS
VPA treatment protects hippocampal neurons
from radiation-induced apoptosis in vivo
To determine whether VPA regulates cell survival
and apoptosis in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus
after irradiation, we pretreated 1-week-old mice with
300 mg/kg of VPA for 7 days prior to cranial irradiation
with 7Gy. Typically, glioblastoma patients are treated with
fractionated focal irradiation delivered as daily fractions
of 2 Gy given five days per week for 6 weeks, for a total
of 60 Gy [63]. We have shown that treatment with 7 Gy
is in the steep part of the sigmoidal dose response curve
for radiation-induced apoptosis in the mouse hippocampus
[64] and hence we used 7 Gy for our studies. Apoptosis
within the subgranular zone was determined by staining
the hippocampal sections with a TUNEL kit, and the
TUNEL positive cells (TPC) were counted (Figs. 1A
& 1B). Three sections from each of three different mice
in each treatment (a total of 9 sections per treatment)
were analyzed. Mice irradiated with 7Gy had increased
apoptosis compared to untreated mice. Mice treated with
VPA prior to 7Gy irradiation had significantly fewer
TPC compared to mice irradiated with 7 Gy (P < 0.001;
Fig. 1B), indicating that VPA treatment protected the
mouse hippocampus from radiation-induced apoptosis.

VPA treatment reduces GL261 cell survival

cells were analyzed by flow cytometry after various
experimental treatments (Fig. 1C). Cells pre-treated
with VPA prior to 4Gy irradiation had significantly less
apoptotic cells (12% annexin V positive: P = 0.002),
than cells treated with PBS alone (50%; Fig. 1C). To
further confirm these results, we monitored the nuclear
morphology of irradiated cells using DAPI staining
(Supplemental Fig. 1, Fig. 1D). Pre-treatment of irradiated
HT22 cells with VPA led to a protective effect, with a
reduced number of apoptotic cells (15%) compared to
35% in PBS-pretreated cells (P < 0.001; Fig. 1D). We
did observe a slight increased apoptosis when cells were
treated with VPA when compared to PBS; this however
was not statistically significant. Treatment of HT22 cells
with VPA led to decreased levels of the pro-apoptotic
protein BAX and increased levels the anti-apoptotic
protein Bcl-2 (Fig. 1E), which is consistent with the
results obtained using the other endpoints for apoptosis
described above. However, we did not detect any PARP
cleavage in irradiated HT22 cells as has been reported
before (Supplementary Fig. 2) [65].

To determine the effect of VPA treatment on cell
viability and survival of hippocampus-derived HT22 cells
and glioblastoma GL261 cells, we performed a colony
formation assay. Cells were treated with 0.6 mM VPA or
PBS for 7 days and equal numbers of cells were plated
to determine plating efficiency. There was no significant
difference in the numbers of colonies from HT22 cells
treated with VPA (P = 0.398) compared to PBS treated
cells (Fig. 2A). However, treatment of GL261 cells with
VPA led to a significant decrease in colony formation
(P = <0.001) compared to PBS control (Fig. 2A).

as compared to cells treated with radiation alone with a
DMF10 of 0.87 (Fig. 2B). However, pretreatment of Daoy
(human medulloblastoma), D54 (human glioma) and
GL261(mouse glioma) cells with 0.6 mM VPA for 7 days
prior to irradiation led to significant radiosensitization
with DMF10 of 2.25, 1.49, and 2.31 for Daoy, D54 and
GL261 cells, respectively (Fig 2B). These results indicate
that VPA treatment protects normal hippocampal neuronal
cells (HT22) from radiation induced cell killing, while
radiosensitizing medulloblastoma cells (Daoy) and GBM
cells (D54 & GL261).

for 96 h, and then 20 μL of cell proliferation assay reagent
(Promega) was added. HT22 cells treated with VPA did
not show any differences in proliferation compared to PBS
treated cells (P = 0.065; Fig. 2C). However, treatment
with VPA led to reduced cell proliferation in Daoy cells
(P  =  <0.002), D54 cells (P = <0.001) and GL261cells
(P = <0.001; Fig. 2C). Thus the anti-proliferative effect
of VPA treatment was observed only in cancer cells (Daoy
D54 and GL261) and not in normal neuronal cells (HT22).

VPA treatment induces the accumulation of
GL261 cells at G2/M
Since VPA treatment led to inhibition of cell
proliferation only in cancer cells, we compared the
effect of VPA treatment on the cell cycle distribution
of normal vs. cancer cells. HT22 and GL261 cells were
treated with PBS or VPA (0.6 mM) for 7 days prior to
irradiation with 4Gy. The cells were harvested 24 h post
irradiation, stained with propidium iodide and analyzed
by flow cytometry. There were no significant alterations
of cell cycle distribution in HT22 cells treated with VPA
alone, while irradiation led to the accumulation of cells
in the G2/M phase (40%) compared to untreated PBS
controls (18%; P = <0.001). The accumulation in G2/M
was abrogated when cells were treated with VPA (25%)

VPA treatment inhibits Daoy, D54 and GL261
cell proliferation
Having observed radiosensitization of cancer cells
(Daoy, D54 and GL261) and radioprotection of normal
cells (HT22) after VPA treatment in clonogenic assays,
we wanted to ascertain if this was due to alterations in
cell proliferation. HT22, Daoy, D54 and GL261 cells were
treated with PBS or VPA (0.6 mM) for 7 days and then
equal numbers of treated cells (of each cell line) were
plated in 96-well plates. The plates were then incubated

of GSK3β at ser9 that inhibits its activity and evaluated
the levels of β-catenin as a surrogate indicator of GSK3β
activity. Since active GSK3β phosphorylates β-catenin
that promotes its degradation, increased accumulation of
β-catenin correlates with decreased activity of GSK3β.
Inhibition of HDAC activity was observed in both HT22
and GL261 cells treated with 0.6 mM VPA for 7 days
(Fig. 4). Interestingly, the inhibition of GSK3β by VPA
treatment was observed only in HT22 cells and not in
GL261cells (Fig. 4). These results indicate that VPA,
in addition to inhibiting HDAC, also inhibits GSK3β
in HT22 cells but not in GL261cells. Thus, the overall
mechanisms of the action of VPA are different in these
two cell lines. VPA treatment associated inhibition
of GSK3β activity contributed to reduced radiationinduced apoptosis in HT22 cells (Fig. 1C). We have
previously shown that inhibition of GSK3β either with
small molecule inhibitors or knockdown led to decreased
apoptosis in normal hippocampal neurons and normal
epithelial cells [64, 68, 69].

prior to irradiation (P = <0.001; Fig. 3). Significant
accumulation in the G2/M phase (41%) was observed
in GL261 cells treated with VPA when compared
to untreated PBS control cells (24%) (P = <0.001).
A larger fraction of G2/M accumulation was observed
when they were treated with a combination of VPA and
irradiation with 4Gy (37%) compared to irradiation
alone (28%; P = <0.001). This increase was however
not statistically significant from the G2/M accumulation
induced by VPA treatment alone (40%; Fig.  3).
There  was no major effect  in the fraction of S phase
cells in either cell line after the various experimental
treatments.

VPA treatment inhibits both HDAC and GSK3β
in HT22 cells
VPA inhibits the activity of histone deacetylases,
HDACs, most likely by binding to the catalytic center of
the enzyme [35]. VPA has also been reported to inhibit
the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β)
both in vitro [66, 67] and in vivo [67]. To determine if
HDAC activity was inhibited by VPA treatments of HT22
and GL261 cells we monitored the levels of acetylated
histone H4. To determine if VPA treatment inhibits
GSK3β in HT22 hippocampal neurons and GL261
glioblastoma cells, we monitored the phosphorylation

curves (Fig. 5A & 5D). One million GL261 or D54 cells
were injected subcutaneously in the right hind limb
of nude mice. Tumor-bearing mice were then treated
with PBS alone, irradiation alone (five daily fractions
of 2  Gy), VPA (300 mg/kg) alone for 5 days, or VPA
(300 mg/kg) for 5 days followed by irradiation (five daily
fractions of 2Gy). In studies on the effect of VPA in mice
models, doses ranging from 150 mg/Kg to 400 mg/Kg
have been used [49, 67, 70]. The time required to reach
a tumor volume of 0.6 cm3 was determined (Fig. 5B
& 5E). An average of 13 days (GL261) and 10.2 days
(D54) was required to reach this tumor volume in PBS
treated mice, 20 days (GL261) and 12 days (D54) in the
VPA treated mice, 26.5 days (GL261) and 15.2 days
(D54) days in irradiated mice and 36.5 days (GL261)
and 24 days (D54) in mice treated with combination of
VPA and irradiation. Kruskal-Wallis and Tukeys pairwise
comparisons indicated a significant difference in the
number of days required to reach a tumor volume of
0.6 cm3 between each treatment group (Figs 5B & 5E).
We also analyzed the effect of the treatments on mean
tumor growth at the midpoint (the 15th day) of the study
(Fig. 5C & 5F). The most pronounced tumor growth
delay was observed in tumors receiving a combination
of VPA and irradiation (0.17 cm3 in GL261; 0.38 cm3

in D54), followed by tumors treated with irradiation
alone (0.34 mm3 in GL261; 0.65 cm3 in D54), followed
by tumors treated with VPA alone (0.43 cm3 in GL261;
0.84 cm3 in D54) followed by untreated tumors (0.86 cm3
in GL261; 1.06 cm3 in D54). This tumor growth data
from day 15 was also analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis
and Tukeys pairwise comparisons. The growth of both
GL261 and D54 tumors was significantly delayed in
mice treated with the combination of VPA and irradiation
when compared to mice receiving radiation alone
(P = <0.001), or mice receiving VPA alone (P =< 0.001),
or PBS treated controls (P = <0.001). Tumor growth
was also significantly delayed in mice treated with
VPA alone when compared to untreated control tumors
(P = <0.001).

bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and stratified into
4 groups having similar distribution of tumor volumes.
Nine mice in each group were then treated with PBS,
irradiation alone (five daily fractions of 2 Gy), VPA
(300 mg/kg) alone for 5 days, or VPA (300 mg/kg) for
5 days followed by irradiation (five daily fractions of
2Gy). We obtained both contrast-enhanced T1-weighted
and T2 weighted MR images for tumor growth analysis.
We scanned the mice at three time points during these
experiments: 1) prior to treatment (Baseline), 2) 7 days
post treatment, and 3) 14 days post treatment (Fig. 6A).
Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn manually around
tumors using Image J software and the corresponding

tumor volumes were calculated. The tumor volumes
of all the treatment groups at the first baseline scan
were similar, with no significant differences among the
groups. In the second scan, seven days post treatment,
tumor volumes for mice treated with either radiation
(13.9 mm3 ) or VPA alone (17.9 mm3 ) were significantly
smaller than PBS treated controls (80.3 mm3 ). The most
significant reduction in volume was seen in mice treated
with combination of VPA and radiation (7.4 mm3 ),
indicating that such treatment reduced the growth of the
glioblastoma tumor most efficiently (Fig. 6B). For the
third scan (14 days post treatment), we scanned mice
treated with VPA alone, irradiation alone and VPA in
combination with irradiation. PBS treated control mice
had to be euthanized due to tumor burden (Fig. 6A).

that treatment of mice with a combination of VPA and

To determine the effects of VPA on the survival of
orthotopic tumor bearing mice, we used an intracranial
GL261 mouse glioblastoma model stably expressing
luciferase. Tumor-bearing mice were screened using
bioluminescence imaging, (BLI) and stratified into four
groups of nine mice each having similar distribution of
tumor volumes. The mice in each group were then treated
with PBS alone, radiation alone (five daily fractions
of 2  Gy), VPA (300 mg/kg) alone for 5 days, or VPA
(300 mg/kg) for 5 days followed by radiation (five daily
fractions of 2Gy). We then analyzed the effect of the
treatments on percent survival at the midpoint of the
study (the 15th day). Percent survival was 13% for PBS
treated mice, 55% for mice treated with radiation and
44% for mice treated with VPA alone. In mice treated
with VPA combined with radiation, 15-day survival
was 100% (Fig. 6C). Using a Cox Proportional Hazard
regression model we found that the mice receiving the
combined treatment with VPA and radiation showed
statistically significant increased survival when compared
to PBS treated mice (P = 0.002), mice treated with
radiation alone (P = 0.0130) or mice treated with VPA

DISCUSSION
Radiation therapy is an effective treatment for
children with medulloblastoma and some forms of
leukemia. Cranial irradiation, however, results in memory
and learning deficits in children [71]. The age dependence
of radiation-induced brain injury has led to delaying
radiotherapy in infants [72]. Treatment of infants and
children with low doses of radiation to the brain often
leads to long lasting neurocognitive deficits that can
become permanent [73, 74]. These neurocognitive deficits
manifest as declines in IQ and higher unemployment
rates as compared to children treated with chemotherapy
alone [75, 76]. It has been proposed that the hippocampal
neuron progenitor cells are the most affected, leading to
the radiation-induced neurocognitive decline [77, 78].
Radiation-induced cognitive deficits involve apoptosis
in the sub-granular region of the hippocampus and
the subsequent diminished neurogenesis [78, 79]. The
efficacy of radiotherapy can be improved by the use of
radioprotectors that prevent radiation damage to normal

tissues [64, 68, 80, 81]. The efficacy of radiotherapy
can also be improved by use of chemical agents that
specifically sensitize cancer cells to radiation [82, 83].
In the present study, mouse hippocampus and
hippocampus-derived cells (HT22) pretreated with VPA
were protected from radiation damage. However, such
radioprotection was not observed in the brain cancer cell
lines (Daoy, D54 and GL261; Fig. 2B & 2C), or in the
GL261 and D54 tumor models (Fig. 5). The selective
protection of hippocampal neurons could be due to
modulations of radiation-induced pro-apoptotic signaling
by VPA (Fig 1E). In contrast to hippocampal neurons in the
sub-granular zone, cancer cells typically do not undergo
apoptosis in response to ionizing radiation. Therapeutic
radiation kills most tumor cells by post-mitotic cell death
through mitotic catastrophe [1, 83]. Hence this differential
response to radiation provides a means to improve the
therapeutic effect of cranial irradiation.
Following treatment of both normal hippocampal
cells (HT22) and glioblastoma cells (GL261) with VPA,
we found increased levels of acetylated histone H4,
indicating that the activity of HDACs was inhibited in
both normal and cancer cells (Fig 4). Several phenotypes
associated with the effects of VPA are brought about by
its action as an inhibitor of HDACs. These include its
cytotoxicity and perturbation on the DNA damage repair
machinery [22, 49]. Although VPA inhibits HDAC in
both normal and cancer cells, it selectively kills cancer
cells [84, 85]. Several mechanisms have been proposed
to explain the preferential selectivity killing of cancer
cells by VPA and other HDAC inhibitors. None of the
proposed mechanism so far can fully account for this
generalized effect, found in multiple cell lines and tumor
types irrespective of the different cell line specific control
of gene transcription [84, 85]. It has been shown that
VPA induces a specific type of DNA damage that can be
repaired in normal cells but not in cancer cells [86]. The
nature of such DNA damage remains to be elucidated.
There is evidence that HDAC inhibitors lower the cell’s
capacity to repair radiation-induced DNA damage. Such
perturbations occur both at the level of DNA damage
signaling and the major DNA repair pathways like NHEJ
and HR [85, 87]. VPA and other HDAC inhibitors have
been shown to decrease several key players in the repair
of DNA DSB in cancer cells, at the levels of protein and/
or mRNA as well as prolonged radiation-induced repair
protein foci. These include Ku70, Ku80, DNA PK, ligase
IV, XRCC4, RAD 51, RAD 50, ATM, γ-H2AX, BRCA1,
BRCA2, and 53 BP1 [46, 87]. These alterations have
been reported in cancer cells but not in normal cells. The
participation of the acetylation of non-histone proteins
in the increased radiosensitivity of HDAC treated cancer
cells has been postulated, but remains to be demonstrated
[1, 84, 88]
We found that VPA protected normal cells from
radiation damage, which was in part due to the attenuation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of radiation-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1A–1D; 2B). Such
attenuation was associated with decreased levels of Bax,
a proapoptotic protein and increased levels of Bcl-2, an
antiapoptotic protein (Fig. 1E). Whether the attenuation of
radiation-induced apoptosis in the hippocampus (Figs. 1A
& 1B) is also associated with alterations in the levels of
these proteins remains to be determined.
We observed an increase in the phosphorylation of
GSK3β (ser9) and stabilization of β-catenin, indicating the
inhibition of the GSK3β activity by VPA treatment, but
only in normal and not in cancer cells (Fig. 4). Previously
we have shown that inhibition of GSK3β either with
small molecule inhibitor or knockdown protected the
hippocampal neurons from radiation-induced apoptosis
and increased clonogenic survival [64, 89]. Further, we
have shown that GSK 3β inhibition enhances the repair
of DNA DSB in irradiated normal hippocampal neurons
(HT22) but not in glioma cells (GL261 and D54). This
effect correlated with increased efficacy of end rejoining
by the NHEJ DSB repair pathway [89]. Hence, we
speculate that the neuroprotection of hippocampal
neurons in vivo involves such enhancement of the efficacy
of the NHEJ by GSK3β. The lack of inhibition of VPAmediated GSK3β in glioma cells could be associated with
the differential VPA sensitivity and radiation response of
cancer cells.
VPA treatment has been reported to provide
neuroprotection and improve cognitive function [67, 90].
The neuroprotection and improved cognitive function was
due, in part, to inhibition of HDAC and GSK3β, which
helped to stabilize antiapoptotic proteins like Bcl-2 in
normal HT22 cells and prevent apoptosis ([67] Fig. 1C,
1D & 1E). We also observed that VPA treatment reduced
the levels of the pro apoptotic protein Bax (Fig. 1E).
VPA treatment induced a G2/M cell cycle arrest
in GL261 cells (Fig 3). The accumulation of cells with
G2/M DNA content is consistent with the induction of
mitotic catastrophe as a mode of cell death in irradiated
cells. Such effects have been reported for several glioma
cells lines treated with VPA [91]. Taken all together, these
results suggest that radioprotection by VPA is selective
for hippocampal neurons, which could be mediated
through the inhibition of HDAC and GSK3β. Although
there has been a report that VPA protected rat brains
from radiation-induced damage, apoptosis in cerebral
cortex cells and long-term blood vessel damage were not
quantitated [92].
We used 300 mg/kg VPA in the studies
demonstrating radioprotection of normal hippocampal
neurons and radiosensitization of glioblastoma in mice.
VPA administered at 300 mg/Kg in mice leads to a
serum concentration between 265–280 μg/ml [93]. At
such serum concentrations, the maximum level of VPA
in mouse brains is 17–30 μg/g [94, 95]. The half-life of
VPA in mice is 1–3 hours [94], while in humans it is 9–18
hours [96, 97]. In humans the maximum therapeutic dose
35014

Oncotarget

for epilepsy and mania is 60 mg/kg, which amounts to
750–4000 mg/day [96]. At these doses the therapeutic
serum levels are 50–150 μg/ml of which the levels of
free VPA are 6–32 μg/ml [98, 99]. The levels of VPA
in cerebrospinal fluid are usually similar to the free
valproic acid levels [100, 101]. There are differences in
VPA metabolism between mice and humans. Thus the
findings in mice are difficult to extrapolate directly to
humans [102]. Nevertheless, we speculate that the levels
of VPA in our studies are comparable to those associated
with therapeutic ranges in humans [102].
We found that 300 mg/kg VPA significantly
protected mouse hippocampal neurons from radiation
damage by attenuating apoptosis (Fig. 1A). Similar
neuroprotection by VPA has been observed in animals
subjected to ischemia [27, 103], traumatic brain
injury  [67], and intracerebral hemorrhage [26]. HDAC
and/ or GSK3β inhibition has been reported in various
studies of animals treated with 300–400 mg/kg of VPA
[67, 103, 104].
In preclinical studies treatment with VPA was
reported to control the growth of a variety of tumors,
including gliomas, neuroblastomas, medulloblastomas
and melanomas [22, 49]. VPA’s antitumor effects involve
the modulation of various cellular and tissue pathways,
including cell-cycle arrest, angiogenesis, apoptosis,
differentiation, senescence and DNA repair [22]. In the
heterotopic GL261 and D54 tumor models, mice treated
with VPA were half as likely to develop a tumor with a
volume greater than 0.6 cm3 than PBS treated mice (Fig.
5B&5E). Tumor growth in mice treated with a combination
of VPA and radiation was significantly delayed when
compared to radiation alone, VPA alone or PBS treated
controls (Fig. 5A & 5B, 6A & 6B). These results
indicate that a combination of VPA with irradiation was
significantly more effective in controlling tumor growth.
VPA treatment alone was also effective in controlling
tumor growth in mice and was significantly better than
no treatment. More importantly, VPA treatment alone did
not enhance tumor growth. These findings suggest that
pre-treatment with VPA may significantly improve the
response of malignant glioma to radiation therapy.
There are reports indicating that VPA alone or in
combination therapy can increase the life span of both
tumor bearing mice [105] and humans with brain cancer
[48, 56, 58, 60, 61]. In clinical trials, valproic acid
was the preferred antiepileptic agent in a combination
therapy that utilized radiation and temozolomide
[48]. Valproic acid has also been reported to enhance
other combination therapies in treating intracranial
gliomas in mice  [105,  106]. We found similar results
while analyzing DCE MRI derived tumor volumes.
Mice treated with a combination of VPA and radiation
showed significantly reduced tumor growth compared
to PBS treated mice (Fig. 6A & 6B). Cox proportional
hazards modeling was used to estimate the hazard ratio
for overall survival between the treatment levels in the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

orthotopic intracranial tumor model. We found that mice
with no treatment were 11.4 times (p = 0.0002) more
likely to die than mice treated with combination of VPA
and radiation. Mice treated with radiation alone were
4.7  times (p =  0.0130) more likely to die than mice
treated with combination of VPA and radiation (Fig. 6C).
The survival of mice correlated with the tumor volume as
seen by DCE MRI (Figs 6A&6B). Overall, these results
indicate that VPA in combination with radiation can
effectively control tumor growth in the brain, leading to
improved survival.
VPA is now drawing attention due to its versatility
in improving cognitive sequelae and protecting against
various neurological insults, and is emerging as a
promising drug for brain cancer treatment [56]. Our
current findings on the radioprotective effects of VPA on
the hippocampus and radio-sensitization effects of VPA in
cancer cells also makes it attractive as a novel therapeutic
strategy for the prevention of neurocognitive deficits
resulting from cranial irradiation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals, cell culture and treatments
Valproic acid was purchased from Sigma. Mouse
hippocampal neuronal cells HT22 were obtained from
David Schubert (The Salk Institute; La Jolla, CA) and
maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies).
Human medulloblastoma Daoy cells were obtained from
ATCC and propagated in Eagle’s Minimum Essential
Medium with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1.5 g/L
sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids,
and 1.0 mM sodium pyruvate. Human glioma D54 and
mouse glioma GL261 cell lines were obtained from
Dr. Yancey Gillespie (University of Alabama-Birmingham,
Birmingham, AL) and maintained in DMEM with Nutrient
Mixture F-12 (1:1), 10% FBS, 1% sodium pyruvate and
1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies). All cells
were grown in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C. Cells were
irradiated at a dose rate of 2.5 Gy/min using a RS2000
160 kV X-ray Irradiator with a 0.3 mm copper filter (Rad
Source Technologies).

Histological staining for apoptosis using TUNEL
One-week-old C57BL/6 mice pups were treated
with daily i.p. injections of VPA (300 mg/kg) or PBS. On
the seventh day of VPA treatment, the pups’ brains were
irradiated with 7 Gy. Twenty four hours later, the animals
were sacrificed and their brains were harvested and fixed
in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The fixed brains were
embedded in paraffin and sectioned coronally. Five micron
thick sections were placed on Superfrost Gold Plus slides,
stained with the DeadEnd™ Colorimetric TUNEL System
(Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
35015

Oncotarget

and counterstained with hematoxylin. For the TUNEL
experiments, at least three animals were used in each
experimental group. TUNEL positive cells (TPC) were
counted using an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped
with an Olympus DP26 digital camera. At least three high
power fields (HPF) per animal were scored. The average
number of TUNEL positive cells per HPF (+/−SD) was
calculated.

microscope (Zeiss). The survival fractions were calculated
as (number of colonies/number of cells plated)/(number
of colonies for corresponding control/number of control
cells plated). The dose modifying factors at 10% survival
(DMF10) were calculated from the survival curves by
taking the ratio of the dose of IR that reduced survival to
10% divided by the dose of IR that reduced survival to
10% in the presence VPA.

Apoptosis assays for cultured cells

Immunoblotting

Apoptosis was monitored by annexin V-APC/
propidium iodide staining using the Apoptosis Detection
Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (BD
PharMingen). Briefly, HT22 cells were treated with PBS
or VPA (0.6 mM) for seven days, and then irradiated
with 4Gy. Sixteen hours post irradiations aliquots of 105
cells were incubated with Annexin V/propidium iodide
for 15 minutes at room temperature. The cells were then
analyzed by flow cytometry, using a two-color MACS
FCM analysis system (Miltenyi Biotech). For each
treatment, the average fold-increase of apoptotic cells over
control (+/− SD) was calculated.
In separate experiments, the apoptotic nuclei
of HT22 cells were counted after staining with 4',
6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The treated cells
were washed with PBS, fixed in 70% ethanol at room
temperature for 10 minutes, and stained with DAPI (Vector
Labs). The nuclear morphology was monitored using an
Olympus BX60 fluorescence microscope equipped with
a Retiga 2000R digital camera. Apoptosis was quantified
by scoring the percentage of cells with apoptotic nuclear
morphology at the single cell level. Condensed or
fragmented nuclei were scored as apoptotic; the average
percentage of apoptotic cells (+/− SD) was calculated in
5–7 randomly selected HPF.

Total protein was extracted from treated cells
using the M-PER mammalian protein extraction
reagent (Pierce). Protein concentration was determined
using the BCA Reagent (Pierce). Protein extracts
were analyzed using antibodies for the detection of
phospho-GSK3βSer-9, GSK3β, β-catenin, PARP, Bcl-2
(Cell Signaling Technologies), Acetyl H4 (Millipore)
and Bax (Santa Cruz). Antibody against actin (Sigma)
was used to normalize protein loading in each lane.
Bands were visualized using the Western Lightning
Chemiluminescence Plus detection system (PerkinElmer),
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Colorimetric cell proliferation assay
Cell proliferation was determined using Cell Titer
96 aqueous non-radioactive cell proliferation assay
reagent (Promega). The assay was performed following
the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were treated
with PBS or 0.6 mM VPA for seven days and equal
numbers of treated HT22 (1000 cells), GL261 (2000
cells), D54 (2000 cells) and Daoy (2000 cells) cells were
plated in 96-well plates. The cells plated in the 96 well
plates had the respective drug or vehicle control. Cell
viability was determined after incubation for 96 h by
measuring the absorbance at 490 nm with a Countess II
L plate reader (Life Technologies). The cells in 96-well
plate were visually scanned in an inverted microscope
AE30 (Motic) after 96 h of incubation, to ensure that cells
were not overly confluent in some experimental arms
before performing the proliferation assay. Experiments
were performed in triplicate, and both average fold
changes relative to controls and standard errors were
calculated.

Colony formation assay
Equal numbers of GL261 and HT22 cells were
plated on 60 mm dishes. After 4–5 h, cells were treated
with either PBS or 0.6 mM VPA for seven days. Colonies
were allowed to form for 10 days, after which cells were
fixed with 70% ethanol and stained with 1% methylene
blue. Colonies having greater than 50 cells were counted
under a microscope and the results plotted. Experiments
were repeated in triplicate and standard errors were
calculated.

Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry
HT22 and GL261 cells were treated with PBS or
0.6 mM VPA for seven days, and then irradiated with
4Gy. Twenty-four hours post irradiation; treated cells were
washed with PBS, fixed in 70% ethanol, and incubated
overnight at -20°C. Cells were pelleted and resuspended
in PBS with DNAse-free RNAse (20 μg/ml) and
incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The cells were then stained
with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) at room temperature
for 15 min and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell cycle

Clonogenic survival assay
Defined numbers of cells were plated and allowed
to attach for 5 hours and then irradiated with 0, 2, 4, 6
or 8 Gy. After 7–10-day incubation, plates were fixed
with 70% ethanol and stained with 1% methylene blue.
Colonies consisting of more than 50 cells were counted

also received either 300 mg/kg VPA or PBS alone i.p.,
daily for five days as well. Over the course of 30 days,
mice were weighed daily and monitored closely for
the signs of pre-morbid state. These signs included
hypoactivity, shallow, rapid and/or labored breathing,
failure to groom, failure to respond to stimuli, hunched
posture, dehydration and weight loss. When any of these
signs were present, mice were euthanized. Surviving
animals were euthanized at the end of the experiment
(45  days after tumor implantation). Survival was
calculated using Kaplan-Meyer analysis.

Mice and treatments
C57BL/6 and Nu/Nu mice (Harlan) were used for
animal studies. Animal procedures were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
at Washington University School of Medicine in St.
Louis. Mice were irradiated at a dose rate of 1 Gy/min
using RS2000 160 kV X-ray Irradiator with a 0.3  mm
copper filter (Rad Source Technologies). Mice were
anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane delivered using oxygen
to immobilize the mice. Only the intended organ or the
tumor was exposed and the rest was shielded with lead
during irradiation.

MRI imaging of intracranial tumors

One million GL261 or D54 cells were injected into
the right flank of each C57BL/6 mouse. Once tumors were
palpable, mice were stratified into four treatment groups
of eight each representing similar distributions of tumor
sizes. Tumors from two groups of mice were irradiated
with 2 Gy fractions daily for five consecutive days for
a total of 10 Gy. These mice received either 300 mg/kg
VPA or PBS as vehicle control by intraperitoneal injection
(i.p.), 60 min prior to each irradiation. Two groups of nonirradiated mice received either 300 mg/kg VPA or PBS
alone by i.p. injection daily for five days as well. Tumor
volumes in the mouse hind limbs were measured using
calipers. The mean tumor volume and standard error were
calculated for each treatment group.

Magnetic resonance images were collected using
an Oxford Instruments 4.7-T magnet (40 cm, clear bore)
equipped with 21-cm inner diameter, actively shielded
Agilent/Magnex (Yarnton) gradient coils (maximum
gradient 28 G/cm; rise time ~650 μs) driven by model
A-240 amplifiers (Oy International Electric Company)
The magnet/gradients were interfaced with an Agilent/
Varian Direct Drive console, and data were collected
using a 1.5-cm OD surface coil (receive) and a 5-cm ID
Helmholtz coil (transmit) actively decoupled coil pair as
described [108]. Before the imaging experiments, mice
were anesthetized with isoflurane/O2 [2–3% (v/v)], and
maintained on isoflurane/O2 [1% (v/v)] throughout the
experiments. Animal body temperature was maintained
at 37°C using a pad heated with warm circulating
water. Mice were injected i.p. with 500 μl MultiHance
contrast agent (Bracco Imaging), diluted 1:10 in sterile
saline, 15 minutes prior to being placed in the magnet.
T1-weighted, spin-echo multi-slice transaxial images
were collected with TR = 0.65 s, TE = 0.02 s, FOV = 1.5 ×
1.5 cm2, slice thickness = 0.5 mm.

Intracranial tumors

Statistical analyses

Orthotopic intracranial tumors were induced by
stereotactically injecting 5 × 104 GL261-FG cells into
the brains of six-week-old nude mice at a position 2 mm
lateral to the bregma at a depth of 3 mm. The GL261FG cells were transduced with a lentivirus for stable
expression of both firefly luciferase and green fluorescent
protein. Ten days after injecting the GL261-FG cells, the
presence of tumor was confirmed by bioluminescence
imaging (BLI) [107]. The mice were then stratified into
four treatment groups of nine, each representing similar
distributions of tumor sizes. Tumors from two groups of
mice were irradiated daily with 2Gy for five consecutive
days for a total of 10 Gy. Mice were anesthetized and
irradiated in a holder designed to irradiate the tumor
region in the head only and shield the rest of the body
with lead during irradiation. These mice received either
300 mg/kg VPA or PBS as vehicle control i.p., 60 min
prior to irradiation. Two groups of non-irradiated mice

The means and standard deviations (SD) of each
treatment group were calculated for all experiments.
The number of samples is indicated in the description
of each experiment. Kaplan-Meier and Cox Proportional
Hazards models were used to analyze survival data,
while non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis analysis was used
to compare treatment effectiveness on tumor growth
delay. All pair-wise comparisons between treatment
groups were adjusted using Tukey’s multiple comparison
method. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
