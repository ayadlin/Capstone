ABSTRACT
A present challenge in breast oncology research is to identify therapeutical targets
which could impact tumor progression. Neurotensin (NTS) and its high affinity receptor
(NTSR1) are up regulated in 20% of breast cancers, and NTSR1 overexpression
was shown to predict a poor prognosis for 5 year overall survival in invasive breast
carcinomas. Interactions between NTS and NTSR1 induce pro-oncogenic biological
effects associated with neoplastic processes and tumor progression. Here, we depict
the cellular mechanisms activated by NTS, and contributing to breast cancer cell
aggressiveness.
We show that neurotensin (NTS) and its high affinity receptor (NTSR1) contribute
to the enhancement of experimental tumor growth and metastasis emergence in
an experimental mice model. This effect ensued following EGFR, HER2, and HER3
over-expression and autocrine activation and was associated with an increase of
metalloproteinase MMP9, HB-EGF and Neuregulin 2 in the culture media. EGFR over
expression ensued in a more intense response to EGF on cellular migration and
invasion. Accordingly, lapatinib, an EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, as well as
metformin, reduced the tumor growth of cells overexpressing NTS and NTSR1. All
cellular effects, such as adherence, migration, invasion, altered by NTS/NTSR1 were
abolished by a specific NTSR1 antagonist. A strong statistical correlation between
NTS-NTSR1-and HER3 (p< 0.0001) as well as NTS-NTSR1-and HER3- HER2 (p< 0.001)
expression was found in human breast tumors.
Expression of NTS/NTSR1 on breast tumoral cells creates a cellular context
associated with cancer aggressiveness by enhancing epidermal growth factor
receptor activity. We propose the use of labeled NTS/NTSR1 complexes to enlarge
the population eligible for therapy targeting HERs tyrosine kinase inhibitor or HER2
overexpression.

INTRODUCTION

property of NTS on breast cancer cellular models was also
shown [15,16].
Under physiology, NTS, a 13 amino acids
peptide, is mainly localized in endocrine N-cells of the
gastrointestinal tract, where it regulates various functions
such as inhibition of gut motility and gastric acid
secretions, stimulation of pancreatic and biliary secretions
and facilitation of fatty acids intake [17,19]. The effects of
NTS are mediated by three subtypes of receptor. NTSR1
and NTSR2 belong to the class A GPCRs [20] and exhibit
high (sub-nanomolar) and low (nanomolar) affinity for
NTS, respectively. NTSR3 or gp/95/sortilin is a single
transmembrane domain receptor. The NTSR1 often
overexpressed in tumors, activates many physiological
effectors participating in cell proliferation, migration,
invasion and remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, like
MAPK, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and RhoGTPases.
NTSR1 activation also transactivates the EGFR receptor in
colonic, prostatic and pancreatic cancer cell lines [21,23].
We propose that a cross-talk occurs between
neurotensinergic and the HER pathways in breast tumors
which effects breast cancer progression. In this report, we
analyzed this hypothesis, and showed that a NTS autocrine
signaling loop dramatically accelerates the tumor growth
and the metastatic progression of a poorly aggressive breast
adenocarcinoma cell line. We analyzed the oncogenic
cellular effects enhanced by NTS, and showed a possible
synergic interaction between EGF and NTS, and observed
a complete remodeling of HERs basal and activated
profiles in cells under the constant stimulation by NTS.

The mortality rate of breast cancer has been
stabilized due to early detection and constant progress in
therapy. Nevertheless, breast cancer remains the leading
cause of cancer-related deaths among women in most of
the western countries [1,2]. The progression of tumors to
a metastatic disease is the primary cause of death in most
patients and the main target of cancer research.
The human epidermal growth factor receptor
(HERs) signaling pathways have been shown to largely
contribute to this process. The success of therapies
employing HERs immunotherapy or tyrosine kinase
inhibitors, while limiting the progression of the disease
and extending the disease free survival time, demonstrates
the contribution of HERs at the clinical level [3]. In breast
cancer, where human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2) gene amplication is detected in 25% of patients
[4], a monoclonal antibody targeting HER2, trastuzumab,
(Herceptin) significantly improves the survival of these
patients [5]. Nevertheless, contribution of the HERs
in breast cancer progression is complex, and studies
have focused more specially on HER3/HER2 or HER2/
EGFR dimers. HER3 and HER2 overexpression and
activation driven growth and metastasis are associated
with a worse prognosis [6,8]. The availability of the
EGFR inhibitors, proposed to patients in association
with HER2 immunotherapy, has been a real benefit [9].
For example, patients with metastatic breast cancer,
which had experienced progression under trastuzumab,
found a benefit from the association of trastuzumab and
Pertuzumab [5], a recombinant humanized monoclonal
antibody binding to the HER2 dimerization domain
and preventing dimerization of HER2 with other HER
receptors (HER3, HER1, and HER4) [10]. More recently,
investigations have focused on autocrine HERs activation
in cells lacking HER2 amplification. This cellular context
generates regulatory mechanisms involved in cancer
progression and is suspected to induce drug resistance.
These mechanisms remain to be clarified, and the
identification of factors inducing this cellular context
would help to better characterize and treat breast tumor.
Amongst the factors contributing to tumor
aggressiveness, neurotensin (NTS) and its cognate highaffinity receptor (NTSR1) have been shown to contribute
to breast cancer progression [11,12]. High proportion of
pro NTS in the blood is also correlated with a higher risk
of breast cancer [13]. NTS and NTSR1 are concomitantly
overexpressed in patients with breast cancer [14].
The deregulated expression profile of the NTSR1 was
correlated with negative prognostic parameters such
as tumor size, the number of invaded lymph nodes,
Scarff, Bloom and Richardson’s histoprognostic grade,
and patient mortality [14]. In corroborating clinical
experiments, a direct effect of the neurotensinergic system
on breast tumor growth in mice, and the anti-apoptotic

RESULTS
The NTS-NTSR1 complex enhances tumor
growth and metastasis emergence from breast
experimental tumor
MCF-7 cells, which constitutively express NTSR1,
were transfected with the neurotensin full length coding
sequence to evaluate the influence of an autocrine
neurotensinergic signaling loop on the tumorigenicity
of the ER-positive breast cancer. Amongst the selected
clones, two showed a differential NTS expression based on
transcription levels the NTS high expressing clone, NTS-h,
and the NTS low expressing clone, NTS-l (Figure 1A
inset). The NTS expression levels were confirmed by
quantitative RT-PCR in both clones, showing a 500-fold
and a 4-fold NTS transcript’s induction for NTS-h and
NTS-l, respectively as compared to the MCF-7 parental
cells (Figure 1SA). High expression levels of NTS alter the
cell morphology by reducing the size of the cytoplasm. The
nucleocytoplasmic ratio is similar for NTS-l and parental
cell lines (1/3.2 and 1/3.3 respectively) whereas the ratio
decreases to (1/2.5) for NTS-h cells (Figure 1S B). The
size of the nucleus remained similar for the three cell

lines (Fig 1S B). Immunofluorescent staining experiments
show the sub-cellular localization of NTS (Figure 1S C panels 1, 2, 3), and NTSR1 (Figure 1S C - panels 4, 5, 6).
In wild type cells, no or an extremely weak NTS labeling
is noted. In the NTS-l cells, NTS immunoreactivity is
dispersed in small dots throughout the cytosol. The same
pattern is observed in NTS-h cells with larger dots of
stronger intensity due to the higher NTS expression level.
In parallel, in MCF-7 cells, NTSR1 labeling is localized
at the cell membrane, whereas an intense intracellular
granular labeling of an endocytosed receptor is seen in
NTS-h cell. NTS-l cells show a dual pattern of NTSR1
localized both at the membrane and inside the cytoplasm.
To evaluate the influence of the NTS autocrine
signaling loop on tumor growth, the MCF-7 parental
line and the two NTS-overexpressing clones, NTS-l
and NTS-h, were xenografted in the mammary fat pad
of female athymic mice. Tumor growth rose with NTS
expression levels (Figure 1A). The group bearing the
MCF-7 cells began to develop tumors after 77 days to
reach a small size of 108 ± 56 mm3 at day 105. During
the same period of time mice bearing NTS-overexpressing
cells developed much bigger tumors, with a volume of 483
± 102 mm3 for NTS-l at day 105 and 1239 ± 251 mm3 for
NTS-h at 91 days. The corresponding tumor weights were
0.2 ± 0.1 g, 1.0 ± 0.2 g and 2.0 ± 0.2 g, respectively. None
of the animals xenografted with MCF-7 cells developed
metastases during the experiment (Figure 1B). On the
contrary, metastases were observed in 41% of the NTS-l
group and 76% of the NTS-h group. The metastases were
preferentially found in the homolateral lymph nodes
(24% and 59% respectively) and the lungs (35% and
47% respectively). Furthermore, 18% of the animals in
the NTS-h group also showed a metastatic spread in the
controlateral lymph nodes reflecting a more advanced
metastatic stage. Immunohistochemical slides representing
examples of a lymph node, a lung, and a kidney metastatic
lesion are shown in figure 1C.

was confirmed by the stronger labeling of all three HER
receptors by immunocytochemistry in NTS-l cells as
compared to MCF-7 cells (Figure 2D). In NTS-l cells,
EGFR is accumulated in clusters close to the nucleus,
while in MCF-7, EGFR is at the membrane, HER2
membrane labeling, and HER3 cytosol labeling are more
intense in NTS-l than in MCF-7 cells (Figure 2D see
white arrow). The specific NTSR1 antagonist, SR 48692,
reduced HERs increases in NTS expressing cells, but
not in wild type cells (Figures 2C and 2S A), validating
the contribution of NTS/NTSR1 complex in this HERs
overexpression. As HERs transcript levels were essentially
the same in MCF-7 and NTS-l cells (Figure 2S B), HERs
protein accumulation in the cells suggest that recycling
and degradation are altered due to NTS exposure.
In parallel, an increase in the activation states for
all three receptors was observed in NTS-l cells. The
phosphorylation levels were enhanced up to 400 and
500% for EGFR and HER3, respectively (Figures 2E
and F), and was partially abolished by the antagonist SR
48692 (Figure 2S C). Similar observations were made
with NTS-h cells and a 200% increase was seen for the
three receptors (not shown).
Subsequently, we searched for a possible EGFR and
HER3 autocrine activation by the release of EGF “like”
ligands from the cell membrane following a proteolysis
process mediated by NTS. In the culture media from NTS-l
cells, the amount of HB-EGF was twofold higher than
MCF-7 cells. The presence of SR 48692 in the culture media
abolished this increase (Figure 3 A). In the same vein, a
stronger release of neuregulin 2 could be detected in the
culture media of NTS-l cells compared to MCF-7 cells, and
again counteracted by SR 48692 (Figure 3 B). The release
of these specific ligands for EGFR and HER3 suggests
an activation of metalloproteases due to NTS exposure.
MMP9 transcripts increased (Figure 3 C) in NTS-l cells as
compared to MCF-7, as was the case for MDA-MB 231
cells [16]. In addition, MMP9 anchored at the membrane
was activated, as a 180% increase of MMP9 released
in culture media was detected in NTS-l as compared to
MCF-7 cells and abolished by SR 48692 (Figure 3 D).
We confirmed the contribution of EGFR and HER2
activation in NTS induced tumor growth by treating
xenografted mice with NTS-h and lapatinib. Lapatinib
inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of both HER2 and
EGFR. This property is currently used in breast cancer
treatment. We confirmed that NTS-h cells do not carry
the following EGFR active mutations: exon 19 deletion,
exon 20 insertion, exon 18 Q719A, Q719C, Q719S and
exon 21 L858R, L861Q point mutations. These cells do
not possesses the HER2 exon 20 insertion, or the KRAS
point mutations: G12D, G12S, G12C, G12R, G12A,
G12V, G13D KRAS. Figures 4 A and B show that the
tumor growth rate is reduced when mice are treated
with lapatinib. The final tumor volume after 23 days of

The NTS/NTSR1 complex enhances EGFR,
HER2, and HER3 expression and activation in
breast cancer and tumoral cells
In order to identify the mechanisms underlying
NTS induced growth and metastasis, we searched for
the possible interrelation between NTS/NTSR1 complex
and epidermal growth factor receptors (HERs). We first
observed the amplification of HER2 and HER3 protein
levels in tumors obtained after the xenograft of NTS-h
and NTS-l cells, as compared to MCF-7 cells. In these
cases, the membranes of the labeled tumoral cells was
often thicker and more intense (Figure 2 A).
Analysis of NTS-l, NTS-h, and MCF-7 cellular
protein content, showed an increase of 150–275% of
EGFR, HER2, and HER3 (Figures 2B and C). This effect

were detected when both drugs were employed. The final
volumes were 135.9 ± 30.4 mm3 and 177.7 ± 51.3 mm3

respectively (Fig 4 A and B). The tumor doubling time was

treatment was 352.3 ± 87 mm3 for the control, and 134.5
± 44.15 mm3 (p= 0.02 vs control) for lapatinib. We also
tested metformin on our model. Metformin is suspected
to provide anticancer effects in breast cancer and several
clinical trials are currently under way [24]. In parallel,
metformin was shown to disrupt the crosstalk between
insulin receptor and NTS receptor in pancreatic cancer
cells [25]. In addition to inhibiting the mTOR pathway,
metformin prevents ERK activation induced by NTS and
insulin [26]. In a breast cancer cellular model with NTS
overexpression, metformin reduced the tumor growth with

Cell detachment is a pre-requisite in metastatic
spreading. For this purpose, we studied the adhesion
ability of our cellular models on various matrices. Cells
were initially detached from their support and the kinetics
of reattachment was evaluated. After 1 hour of seeding,
the NTS-h cells displayed only 68% and 60% of the
adhesion capacity on collagen (Figure 5 B) and matrigel
(Figure 3S B) respectively, as compared to MCF-7. NTS-l
cells displayed 55% and 52%, respectively. Interestingly,
this decline in cellular adhesion ability stabilizes over
time. At 48 hours of post seeding, the percentage of
adherent cells is similar to those after 1 hour (Figure 5 B
and 3S B). This suggests that NTS alters the basal cell
adhesion capacities of the tumor cells.
We performed migration assays on type I collagen
or matrigel supports, because migration requires cell

interactions with the extracellular matrix. We developed an
experimental procedure, in order to estimate the migration
speed of the cells. As described in detail in the methods
section, this procedure allows measuring the average
distance covered by the cells within 48h, while preserving
the matrix coating on the dishes. As shown in figure 5 C
and 3S C, NTS expression significantly affects the basal
migration speed of the NTS-l cells on both collagen and
matrigel coated dishes. The migration speed on collagen
was 2.50 ± 0.07 µm/h and 3.10 ± 0.09 µm/h (p < 0.0001;
n=10) and on matrigel was 3.99 ± 0.21 µm/h and 5.31
± 0.24 µm/h (p = 0.003; n=12) for MCF-7 and NTS-l,
respectively. As EGFR expression was enhanced under
NTS autocrine regulation, we inquired on the effect of
EGF on cell speed migration. When cells were treated
with EGF, a clear synergic effect between NTS and EGF

was observed. The NTS-l cells migrate 38% and 42%
faster when treated with EGF on collagen and matrigel
respectively, compared to EGF-treated MCF-7 cells
(Figure 5 C and 3S C). In order to confirm the contribution
of the NTS-NTSR1 complex in this synergic effect,
MCF-7 and NTS-l were treated with EGF and the NTSR1
specific antagonist SR 48692. As shown in figure 5 C and
3S C, this treatment had no effect on the EGF-induced
migration of MCF-7 on collagen and matrigel, whereas,
SR 48692 inhibited the acceleration of the migration speed
in the EGF-treated NTS-l cells. Specific PKC and PLC
inhibitors were applied and clearly abolished the synergic
effect of NTS and EGF observed in NTS-l cells. In the
parental cells, EGF’s contribution to the migratory effect
was insensitive to these inhibitors although the basal
migration speed did increase in matrigel matrix (Figures
5 D and 3S D). As control, a specific inhibitor of EGFR,
the AG1478, completely abolished the EGF-induced

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

migration in both MCF-7 and NTS-overexpressing cells
(Figure 5 D and 3S D).
The invasiveness properties of NTS-overexpressing
cells, was studied using a 3 dimensional collagen invasion
assay. Results are expressed as the invasion index
corresponding to the number of invading cells related to
the number of total seeded cells. The introduction of NTS
expression into MCF-7 cells induced a small increase in
invasiveness properties (Figure 5 E). However, EGFinduced invasion doubled in NTS-overexpressing cells
(20% invasion index) as compared to MCF-7 (10% invasion
index). The induction of invasiveness was inhibited by PKC
inhibitors only in NTS-overexpressing clones, suggesting
dependence of this effect on GPCR activation.
The synergic effects of NTS and EGF on cellular
migration and invasion suggest that a new pattern of HER
heterodimers, with a higher EGF response potency, is
generated in the cells. When cells were stimulated with

a score of 2 and 3 indicate the overexpressed condition,
and consequently we performed contingent’s analysis on
these combined scores. Results are summarized in table 1.
NTS and NTSR1 were found in 23% of the samples,
in agreement with our previous studies [14], whereas
HER2 and HER3 were found in 28% and 53% of the

(16%) than HER2 (7%). HER3 expression was positively

validation of these factors is difficult because tumors are
often heterogeneous and their molecular characteristics
evolve over time. In addition to the clinical parameters,
genetic alterations on key genes provide additional
information on disease outcome. These genetic alterations
can be modulated by regulatory mechanism which may
cause changes to the amplitude of cell aggressiveness
within the tumor. While genetic alterations acquired by
tumors are irreversible, their regulatory process can be
de-programmed to restore a tumor phenotype to a less
aggressive and more differentiated form.
In this article we show that the NTS/NTSR1
complex enhances tumor aggressiveness (tumor
growth and metastasis emergence) by enhancing HERs
expression, and their activation by the release of specific

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

EGFR and HER3 ligands. This concept can be extended
to other tumors, as we observed similar results in lung
cancer cells and subsequent experimental tumors [27].
In lung cancer cells all three receptors (but mainly HER2
and HER3) are over expressed under NTS autocrine
regulation. EGFR and HER3 activation occurred with
HB-EGF and NGR1 as well as MMP1 released from the
cells [51].
In breast cancer cells, NTSR1 activation alters many
cellular effects having oncogenic characteristics including
proliferation, survival, adherence, migration and invasion,
with a synergic effect between NTS and EGF on cellular
migration and invasiveness. This latter point may explain
the exacerbation of the metastasis process seen due to
NTSR1 activation. Synergy between NTS and EGF was

previously described on DNA synthesis in primary adult
rats’ hepatocytes [28], and the regulation between these
two factors appears to be independent of oncogenic
characteristics of the cells. EGF was detected in normal
and tumoral breast tissues, with a higher expression found
in normal tissues adjacent to tumor [29]. We previously
showed that NTS is expressed in normal breast epithelial
cells. Its expression is regulated by estrogen [14]. The
synergy between NTS and EGF may therefore occur
during the breast carcinogenesis.
Our data showed that under NTS stimulation,
EGFR, HER2 and HER3 are up-regulated and intrinsically
activated. This over expression was not associated with
gene transcriptional or post-transcriptional activity,
suggesting that NTS induced a new equilibrium in HERs
cellular traffic and a new pattern of HERs formed after
stimulation. HERs internalization pathways depend on the
expression of ligands and/or their receptors [30,31]. Under
physiological conditions (low concentration of ligands
and moderate EGFR expression <200 000/cell), EGFR
internalization is dependent on clathrin coated pits, with
a half-life of 6-10 hours. However, under conditions of
receptor overexpression or high concentration of ligands,
the clathrin pathway becomes saturated, and the complex
(ligand-receptor) is internalized with a slow kinetics in a
clathrin independent pathway. Under these conditions, the
half-life can reach 24 hours [32,33].
In cells overexpressing HER2, receptors are
mainly localized at the cell membrane, indicating that
overexpression of HER2 does not lead to accelerating
its endocytosis [34].The HER2 heterodimerization
with EGFR influences the endocytosis pathway for
both receptors. Treatment by EGF of cells expressing
low HER2, resulted in HER2 down-regulation [35]. In
contrast, EGFR activation in cells overexpressing HER2,
does not affect the membrane expression of HER2 or its
degradation [34,36]. In addition, overexpression of HER2
had a dominant-negative effect on the down regulation
of stimulated EGFR, and stabilized both receptors by
altering autophosphorylation patterns [34,37]. HER2
overexpression may also prevent EGFR internalization by
clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and it’s re-directed from
the degradation to the recycling pathway [36,38,39].
The activation of HER3 leads to its internalization
and its down regulation. However, HER3 internalization
is slower than EGFR internalization [40]. In addition,
HER3 is inefficiently sorted to the degradation pathway,
apparently due to the lack of the C-terminal domain,
which contains patterns used for targeting to lysosomes
[41,42]. It has also been suggested that neuregulins do not
guide HER3 to degradation due to the early dissociation of
complexes (ligand-receptor) in endosomes [41]. In these
situations the stabilization of HERs cells are independent
of gene transcription, activation and amplification, as in
the case for NTS.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Associated with HERs regulation, we also
observed an increase of NRG2 and HB-EGF secretion
by NTS mediated by MMP activation. The release of
these growth factors caused the concomitant activation
of HER3 and EGFR. EGF “like” ligands are largely
implicated in breast cancer progression, yet, most reports
have only studied the expression of ligands specific to
EGFR, or those specific to HER3. For example, in one
case a 10 fold increase of HB-EGF in cancer tissues was
reported, and in another a high proportion of the four
neuregulins and major isoforms were expressed in the
cytoplasm of DCIS and IDC of the breast [29,43,44].
In both cases, deleterious effects of growth factors
are often in HER2 overexpressing cells, indicating
that EGFR/HER2 and/or HER3/HER2 dimers are
related to biological aggressiveness [29]. Globally, the
overexpression of both HER2 and HER3 participates in
the stabilization of the HERs dimer, and subsequently
the sustained activation of the HERs, and the survival
pathway. By enhancing the overexpression and
activation of EGFR, HER2 and HER3, the NTS/NTSR1
complex becomes an upstream factor that modulates this
regulatory mechanism.
In agreement with in vitro studies, tumor growth
induced by NTS/NTSR1 can be restrained by a specific
tyrosine kinase inhibitor EGFR and HER2, lapatinib. The
cascade of biological events from the interaction between
NTS and NTSR1 to the activation of HERs receptor
appears to be a major contributor to rapid cancer cell
growth.
This cascade is inhibited by metformin, known to
interfere with activated mTOR and ERK pathway [26,45].
The lack of additional effects from the combination of
the two drugs suggests that consecutive cellular events
lead to increase tumor aggressiveness by NTS. We
previously showed that sustained NTSR1 activation
generated a permanent PKC dependent activation of ERK
signaling [46]. It is therefore coherent that metformin
and other ERK or PKC inhibitors counteract the same
NTS oncogenic cellular effect. PKC appears to be a
central signaling hub to generate cell aggressiveness by
NTS/NTSR1 through the sustained overexpression and
activation of HERs.
Experimental tumors report the tumorigenic
performance of single cell lines or clones. Nevertheless,
heterogeneity is an important characteristic of human
tumors. For instance, we found that in 35% of patient with
IDC, NTSR1 was expressed in at least 80% of tumoral
cells, and only 20% of patients express high level of
NTSR1 and NTS [47]. In human tumors, NTS and NTSR1
are expressed in cells clusters with diverse sizes. Tumoral
cells with potential aggressiveness characteristics could be
detected with NTS/NTSR1 labeling, and specific treatment
could be proposed accordingly. Lapatinib is proposed in
a second line of treatments, in combination with other

drug in advanced or metastatic breast cancers whose
tumors overexpress HER2. Our results suggest that a more
restrained (or targeted) population, can be determined by
taking into account NTS and NTSR1 co expression. The
resulting subpopulation will provide a significantly better
performance for this drug.

Samples in Laemmli buffer were loaded on 10%
SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes.
Membranes were exposed to primary antibody overnight.
Total anti-EGFR (1:500), anti-phospho-EGFR (1:500),
anti-phospho-HER2 (1:500), anti-HER3 (1:2000), antiphospho-HER3 (1:1000), anti-ERK 1/2 (1:2000) were
from Cell Signaling Technology®. Total anti-HER2
(1:2000) were purchased from Neomarkers and anti-βactin
(1:50000) from Sigma®. Secondary anti-rabbit (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-mouse (Sigma®) antibodies
conjugated to HRP were used at 1:2000 dilutions for
1h at room temperature and visualized by enhanced
chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare®). See details in
supplementary information.

CONCLUSION
The activation of the neurotensinergic system in
breast tumors induces the overexpression of the EGFR,
HER2 and HER3 receptors and their concomitant autocrine
activation. The presence of this regulatory mechanism
would have a significant impact on cancer progression in
tumor cells by accelerating the process of metastasis. It
also modulates the response to tyrosine inhibitor HER2
and EGFR therapy. NTS/NSTR1 overexpression in breast
cancer cells creates a tumoral context for EGFR tyrosine
kinase inhibitor responsiveness, and therefore a new
population of patients would be eligible to these specific
tyrosine inhibitors.

Adhesion assays
The assay was performed in 96-wells plates coated
or not with 50 µg/mL of type I collagen (Sigma®)
overnight at 4°C or with 1:10 diluted-growth factor
reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences®) for 1 hour at 37°C.
Cells were harvested with PBS containing 0.5 mM
EDTA for 20 min at 37°C, pelleted and suspended in
adhesion buffer (DMEM, 15 mM HEPES, 1.2g/L sodium
bicarbonate, 0.2% BSA). 5x104 cells per well were seeded
and incubated at 37°C for 1 or 48 hours. Wells were
washed with culture medium and adherent cells fixed
with 5% paraformaldehyde for 45 min, then colored with
0.1% cristal violet during 30 min at room temperature.
Cells were subjected to 30 min lysis in 1% SDS under
agitation. Absorbance at 570 nm was determined by
spectrophotometric measures and correlates with the
number of adherent remaining cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture procedure
The human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF7 and the corresponding NTS–overexpressing clones,
NTS-h (high level of NTS) and NTS-l (low level of
NTS), were grown at 37°C, in a humidified atmosphere
of 5% CO2, in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum, 2 mM glutamine and G418 0.5 mg/mL
(Invitrogen™).

3 millions cells (MCF-7, NTS-h, NTS-l) resuspended
in Matrigel (BD Biosciences) were then inoculated in
the right mammary gland of the mice. Tumor growth
was induced by a daily intra-peritoneal injection of
2µg estradiol per mouse. Tumors, axillary and inguinal
lymph nodes, lungs, liver and bones (vertebra, sternum)
were taken, weighed and fixed in formol or frozen. All
the procedures were in accordance with the “Guide of
the Care and Use of laboratory Animals”. Institutional
Review Board approval was obtained by «Le Comité
d’Ethique pour l’Expérimentation Animale Charles
Darwin # Ce5/2010/049 ». For lapatinib experiments
NTS-h cells were inoculated in the left mammary gland
of the mice. 51 days after injection, 4 groups of 7 mice
were randomized as follows : 95.9 ± 14.57 mm3 for
control group, 94.5 ± 15.0 mm3 for lapatinib group, 91.5 ±
14.09 mm3 for metformin group and 95.6 ± 12.20 mm3
for lapatinib and metformin group. Mice were treated for
21 days per os, with sesame oil containing 6% DMSO, or
75 mg/kg lapatinib, or 200 mg/kg metformin or both.

Colony growth assays were performed by seeding
on the top of a 0.6% low gelling temperature agarose layer,
5x103 cells in 0.5 mL of cultured medium containing 0.3%
agarose solution ± EGF (10 ng/mL). Culture medium
and EGF were replenished every 2-3 days. Cells were
incubated at 37°C for 12 days and colonies ≥ 50 µm were
counted in the whole well.

Cell migration assays
12 wells-culture plates were coated with type I
collagen or Matrigel as mentioned in adhesion assay.
1x105 cells were plated for 4 hours in an 8 mm-cloning
ring placed in the center of the well to form a confluent
circle of monolayer cells. The cylinder was removed and
cells grow for 16 hours. Cells were then treated in serumfree medium ± EGF (10 ng/mL) in the presence or absence
of various cell signaling inhibitors. Four pictures were

acquired per well at the initial time of treatment and 48
hours later for comparison with an inverted microscope
at 200X magnification. Migration speed was determined
using the Morpho Expert software (Explora Nova) and
was expressed as the average cells covered distance
divided by the experimental duration (µm/h). Presented
results are expressed in percentage of the non-treated
condition.

We studied 499 specimen from patients operated
for breast cancer in 2008 in Algeria. The average patient
age was 51.1 ± 11.7 years. The sizes of the tumors were
36.3 ± 21.7 mm. The SBR histoprognostic grading
was 6% grade I, 63% grade II and 31% grade III (See
supplementary information). Investigation has been
conducted in accordance with the ethical standards and
according to the Declaration of Helsinki and according
to Algerian guidelines and has been approved by the
authors' institutional review board from CPMC. Data were
analyzed anonymously.

Collagen invasion assays
Invasion potential was evaluated by a single-cell
collagen invasion model, extensively described [48].
Briefly, 6-wells plates were coated with 1.25 mL of a 1
mg/mL collagen type I solution, allowed to gel for at least
1 hour at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing
10% of CO2. 2x105 viable single-cells, obtained by mild
enzymatic dissociation with trypsin/EDTA solution and
filtration, are seeded on the top of the gel in presence or
not of EGF (100 ng/mL) and/or Gö6976 (4x10-8 M) for
24h. Invasion index (cells with invasive extensions versus
total number of cells × 100) was determined by counting
the number of invading and non-invading cells present
in 10 to 15 random fields of an inverted phase-contrast
microscope.

Statistics
Statistical analysis was carried out using test
Student’s t-test or Student-Newman-Keuls Multiple
Comparisons Test : ***p<0.001,**p<0.01, and *p<0.05.
For contingency analysis Fisher's Exact Test was applied.
The Odds ratio was performed using the approximation

ADDITIONAL METHODS
Transfection procedure

ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay)

Total RNA was extracted by the acidic phenol/
chloroform guanidine thiocyanate method as documented
by [49,50]. Detailed are described in supplementary
information.

Following the manufacturer’s instructions, a
pCDNA3.1 plasmid encoding the large fragment of rat
neurotensin ou neurotensin full length coding sequence
was transfected in MCF-7 cells using the Lipofectamine
Plus Reagent (Invitrogen™). Briefly, 0.8x106 cells were
plated in 60 mm-Petri dishes and were allowed to grow
24 hours before transfection. 2µg of DNA were complexed
together with the Plus Reagent and the Lipofectamine
Reagent to form transfection complexes which were
incubated during 4 hours on the cells. Complete medium
was then added to reach a 10% final fetal calf serum
concentration. 24 hours later, cells were harvested
and placed in fresh culture medium. Selection was
performed 2 days after transfection with 1mg/mL of G418

NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0,5% NP40, 0,5% glycerol, 1 mM
PMSF, protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail) at 4°C
for 30 min. Samples in Laemmli buffer were loaded on
10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes.

Cells were seeded at 4X10 cells in 100 mm dish
in culture media. The next day media was changed to
4.5 mL of serum free media for 48h. To assay Hb-EGF
and NRG-2, the media were concentrated with dialysis
tube (7 Spectra / Por ® Dialysis Membrane). In all
samples Protease Inhibitor Cocktail P8340 [1:100] were
added. MMP9, HB-EGF and NRG2 released in the culture
media were assayed by ELISA kits (DuoSet®ELISA

RNA extraction
Total RNA was extracted by the acidic phenol/
chloroform guanidine thiocyanate. Two cycles of
phenol-chloroform extraction (pH 4.7) were preceded
by two ethanol precipitations in GTC buffer (4 M
Guanidium Thiocyanate, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM
EDTA pH 8.0, 30% N-lauroylsarcosine sodium salt, 1%
β-mercaptoethanol) and followed by a final extraction with
chloroform-isoamyl alcohol 25:1 (v/v). Two final ethanol
precipitations in acetic acid and NET buffer (150 mM
NaCl, 15 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA) were
successively performed. After washing in 70% ethanol,
pellets were resuspended in 20 µL of sterile deionized
diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and titrated by
spectrophotometric measure of the absorbance at 260 nm.

Immunohistochemistry
Deparaffinized TMA sections (4 µm) were
subjected to heat-induced epitope retrieval in citrate
buffer (pH 6.0). The sections were labeled for the target
