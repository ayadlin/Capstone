Abstract
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a member of the
ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, is overexpressed in
as many as 60% cases of breast and other cancers. EGFR
overexpression is a characteristic of highly aggressive molecular subtypes of breast cancer with basal-like and BRCA1
mutant phenotypes distinct from ErbB2-overexpressing breast
cancers. Yet, EGFR is substantially weaker compared with
ErbB2 in promoting the oncogenic transformation of nontumorigenic human mammary epithelial cells (human MEC),
suggesting a role for cooperating oncogenes. Here, we have
modeled the co-overexpression of EGFR and a biologically and
clinically relevant potential modifier c-Src in two distinct
immortal but nontumorigenic human MECs. Using a combination of morphologic analysis and confocal imaging of
polarity markers in three-dimensional Matrigel culture together with functional analyses of early oncogenic traits, we
show for the first time that EGFR and c-Src co-overexpression
but not EGFR or c-Src overexpression alone unleashes an
oncogenic signaling program that leads to hyperproliferation
and loss of polarity in three-dimensional acinar cultures,
marked enhancement of migratory and invasive behavior, and
anchorage-independent growth. Our results establish that
EGFR overexpression in an appropriate context (modeled here
using c-Src overexpression) can initiate oncogenic transformation of nontumorigenic human MECs and provide a
suitable in vitro model to interrogate human breast cancer–
relevant oncogenic signaling pathways initiated by overexpressed EGFR and to identify modifiers of EGFR-mediated
breast oncogenesis. [Cancer Res 2007;67(9):4164–72]

Introduction
Members of the ErbB family of growth factor receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTK), in particular the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR or ErbB1) and ErbB2, have been implicated in the
pathogenesis of human cancers and have emerged as targets for
rational cancer therapy, as exemplified by the development of

trastuzumab (Herceptin) for the treatment of ErbB2-overexpressing
breast cancer patients (1).
EGFR is overexpressed in over a quarter of breast cancer
patients and in as many as 60% cases in some studies (2). EGFR
overexpression has also been reported in other cancers such as
those of the colon, lung, and ovary (3). Infrequent co-overexpression of EGFR and ErbB2 suggests that EGFR overexpression
defines a distinct subset of breast and other solid tumors (3, 4).
Indeed, microarray-based molecular profiling showed the EGFR
overexpression to be highly prevalent in breast cancer subtypes
with the basal cell–like and BRCA1 mutant phenotypes with the
worst clinical outcomes (5–7). Despite this evidence validating
EGFR overexpression as a biomarker of poor prognosis and a
therapeutic target, success with EGFR-directed kinase inhibitors
has been limited primarily to non–small-cell lung cancer with
activating EGFR mutations (8). It is crucial to gain further insights
into oncogenic signaling by EGFR and the role of potential
modifiers that may need to be concurrently targeted for effective
therapy.
Although ErbB2 and EGFR are both linked to breast cancer,
in vitro cell biological models have shown more potent transforming activities of ErbB2 (9–11). Notably, inducible dimers of
ErbB2 (or ErbB2-EGFR heterodimers) but not of EGFR expressed in
nontumorigenic MEC line MCF10A reinitiated the proliferation of
quiescent acini grown in three-dimensional Matrigel cultures, and
only ErbB2 activation obliterated the lumen formation (12). These
findings suggest that additional alterations promote EGFRdependent oncogenic transformation in MECs, and that the
three-dimensional acinar culture could reveal the role of such
collaborators. The non–receptor protein tyrosine kinase c-Src is
likely to be one such collaborator.
Clinical-pathologic studies have shown elevated c-Src protein
levels and/or activity in about 70% of primary human breast and
other epithelial tumors, often with concomitant ErbB2 or EGFR
overexpression (reviewed in refs. 3, 13, 14). The c-Src–overexpressing tumors include a subset of late stage breast cancers
with more aggressive disease (reviewed in refs. 3, 13). Experimental
studies support a positive role of c-Src overexpression in signaling
through ErbB receptors and other RTKs (3). Studies in breast
cancer cell lines and limited analysis of tumor tissues showed that
c-Src associates with EGFR or ErbB2 (3, 14). However, analyses of
Src-dependent oncogenesis in the past have used activated Src
mutants rarely seen in human cancers and never observed in
breast cancer (reviewed in refs. 13–15). Parsons et al. first showed
the cooperative tumorigenesis by wild-type c-Src and EGFR in
C3H10T1/2 murine fibroblasts (3, 16) and showed that c-Src

Mammary Cell Transformation by c-Src and EGFR

overexpression in EGFR-expressing metastatic breast and other
cancer cell lines promoted cell migration (3). Thus, c-Src represents
a clinically and biologically relevant modifier of EGFR-mediated
oncogenesis, but such a role has not been investigated in
nontransformed human epithelial cell models.
Here, we modeled the co-overexpression of EGFR and c-Src in
well-defined human MECs to address the hypothesis that c-Src is a
modifier of EGFR-mediated mammary epithelial oncogenesis. We
engineered immortal but nontumorigenic human MECs to overexpress EGFR and c-Src, either individually or in combination, and
examined the biological consequences of these manipulations in
two-dimensional and three-dimensional culture systems. We show
that c-Src overexpression, while of minor consequence by itself,
dramatically promotes the ability of overexpressed EGFR to induce
a phenotype of branched and irregular acini formation in threedimensional Matrigel cultures and enhances the migration,
invasion, and anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. Thus,
our findings establish that c-Src can modify EGFR-mediated
mammary oncogenesis and provide a simple and tractable system
to identify other EGFR modifiers and to dissect c-Src–regulated
EGFR oncogenesis pathways.

Materials and Methods
Retroviral constructs. The wild-type human EGFR and ErbB2 were PCR
amplified from cDNA templates (17, 18) and directionally cloned into the
XhoI and HpaI sites of the pMSCV-Puro vector (Clontech). Mouse c-Src
sequence was PCR amplified from the pLNCX-Src plasmid (provided by
Dr. Joan Brugge) and directionally cloned into the BglII and XhoI sites of the
pMSCV-Hygro vector (Clontech). The kinase-inactive c-Src K297R mutant
was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit
(Stratagene). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing.
Antibodies and other reagents. The following antibodies were
obtained from commercial sources: rabbit polyclonal (pAb) anti-EGFR,
pAb anti-ErbB2, monoclonal (mAb) anti-c-Src, pAb anti-PLCg1, pAb anti–
phosphorylated AKT (pAKT), and mAb anti-AKT were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology; pAb anti–phosphorylated EGFR-pY1068, anti–phosphorylated EGFR-pY845, anti–phosphorylated EGFR-pY1173, anti–phosphorylated EGFR-pY992, anti–phosphorylated Src (416), anti–phosphorylated Src
homology and collagen (Shc), anti-Shc, anti–phosphorylated PLCg1, anti–
phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (antipSTAT3), anti-STAT3, and anti-STAT5 were from Cell Signaling Technology;
mAb anti-EGFR Ab-12 and pAb anti-pSTAT5b were from Lab Vision Corp.;
mAb anti-h actin was from Sigma-Aldrich; mAb anti-a6 integrin was from
Chemicon. mAb anti-EGFR (clone 528; American Type Culture Collection)
and mAb anti-E-cadherin (clone E 4.6; provided by Drs. Jonathan Higgins
and Michael Brenner; ref. 19) were Protein G purified from hybridoma
supernatants. Purified mAb 4G10 (anti-pY) was provided by Dr. Brian
Druker. Purified mouse EGF was from Sigma-Aldrich. The Src inhibitor PP2
and EGFR inhibitor AG1478 were from Calbiochem. Matrigel was
purchased from BD Biosciences.
MEC lines. 16A5 is an HPV16 E6/E7–immortalized derivative of
reduction mammoplasty-derived 76N normal MEC line (20). Spontaneously
immortalized MEC line MCF10A (21) was obtained from Dr. Senthil
Muthuswamy (22). The MECs and their retroviral transductants (below)
were cultured in DFCI-1 medium supplemented with 12.5 ng/mL EGF (20).
Retroviral infections. Retroviral supernatants were generated by
calcium phosphate–mediated cotransfection of the expression plasmids
and the packaging plasmid pIK into the packaging cell line TSA54 (23). The
retroviral supernatants, collected 24 h after transfection, were used to infect
subconfluent MECs in three sequential 4-h incubations in the presence of
4 Ag/mL polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich). Transductants were selected in
puromycin (16A5, 0.5 Ag/mL; MCF10A, 1 Ag/mL) or hygromycin (16A5,
5 Ag/mL; MCF10A, 10 Ag/mL), 48 h after infection. Double transductants
were derived by serial infection.

EGF stimulation, immunoprecipitations, immunoblotting, and gel
electrophoresis of proteins. Cells at 60% to 70% confluence in DFCI-1
medium were switched to growth factor–deficient D3 medium (24) for
48 h and stimulated with EGF (10 ng/mL unless otherwise indicated) for the
indicated time periods. Cell lysates were prepared in cold lysis buffer
containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L sodium
chloride, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 Ag/mL
each of leupeptin and pepstatin, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, and
10 mmol/L sodium fluoride. Immunoprecipitations and Western blotting
were done as described (25). The films were scanned with an HP ScanJet 4
scanner (Hewlett-Packard), and the density of bands was quantified using the
Labworks 4.5 Image Acquisition and Analysis software for Windows (UVP).
Transwell cell migration assay. The Transwell chambers with 8-Am
pores (Corning) were coated overnight at 4jC with 2% laminin followed by
blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h. Cells (2.5  104) deprived of
EGF for 48 h in D3 medium were plated in the top chamber in 0.1 mL D3 for
2 h to allow attachment, and D3, with or without EGF (12.5 ng/mL), was
added in the bottom chamber. PP2 was added to cells in top chamber
2 h before migration assay and to D3 medium in the bottom chamber. After
5 h, cells on the top side were removed by scraping, and the migrated cells
were fixed in methanol at 20jC and visualized using the Diff-Quik stain
(Dade Behring). The number of cells in three high-power (400) fields was
enumerated for each filter. Experiments were repeated a minimum of three
times. Data were analyzed using the Student’s t test, and P < 0.05 was
considered significant.
Matrigel invasion assay. Invasion assays were carried out using the
24-well BD Biocoat Matrigel Invasion Chambers (BD Biosciences) according
to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Briefly, 2  104 cells in 0.2 mL D3
were added to the top chambers of Matrigel-coated or control wells with D3
medium containing 12.5 ng/mL EGF in the bottom chamber. After 22 h at
37jC, the filters were processed as in the migration assay, and the cells were
enumerated in three high-power fields (400) per filter. The experiments
were done at least three times.
Anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. 16A5 (105) or MCF10A
(5  105) transductants were plated per 60-mm dish in 2 mL of 0.3% agarose
in DFCI-1 medium (20) on top of a bottom layer of 0.5% agarose. The cells
were fed every 3 days. Phase-contrast images were obtained under 40
magnification, and colonies were counted. Each experiment was done in
triplicates.
Three-dimensional Matrigel culture and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells (2.5  103) in 0.4 mL of 2% Matrigel in DFCI-1
medium were plated per well of an eight-well chamber slide on top of a
polymerized layer of 100% Matrigel, as described (22). The cultures were fed
every 3 days. Phase-contrast images were obtained under 100 magnification. For immunofluorescence analyses, the cultures were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde on day 20, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min,
and stained with anti-E-cadherin (1:1,000) or anti-a6 integrin (1:200) primary
antibodies followed by Alexa Fluor 488– and Alexa Fluor 594–conjugated
secondary antibodies, respectively (Molecular Probes). The slides were
mounted with Vectashield mounting medium containing 4¶,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (Vector Laboratories). Images were acquired with a Zeiss
LSM510 UV META confocal microscope under 400 magnification and
analyzed with LSM510 META Image Examiner software (version 3.1.0; Zeiss).
Tumorigenicity assays. Six-week-old female athymic nude (nu/nu) mice
(Charles River Laboratories) were injected s.c. close to the fourth mammary
gland with 107 cells in 0.2 mL of 1:1 Matrigel and PBS, and tumor growth
was monitored. Animals were euthanized, and necropsies were done when
tumors reached 1 to 1.5 cm diameter, or after 8 months if no tumors
formed. Each cell line was tested in at least five animals. All animal-related
procedures were in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee guidelines.

immortal, nontumorigenic human MECs, we derived polyclonal
retroviral transductants of HPV E6/E7–immortalized 16A5 and
spontaneously immortal MCF10A cell lines, as such cells have been
widely employed to investigate the cell biology of early mammary
tumor progression (26–33). Western blot analysis of cell lysates
confirmed the expression of endogenous and overexpressed levels
of c-Src, EGFR, or ErbB2 as well as comparable overexpression of
EGFR and c-Src in single and double transductants (Fig. 1A and B).
We used the 16A5 transductants for in-depth analyses and the
MCF10A transductants to confirm key observations.
To assess if EGFR and c-Src co-overexpressed in nontransformed MECs exhibit biochemical synergy reported in rodent
fibroblasts and breast cancer cell lines (3), we examined the
status of EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR in parental 16A5
cells and its transductants (Fig. 2). Although EGF-deprived cells
showed expected lack of tyrosine phosphorylation in antiphosphotyrosine (anti-pY) blots of whole-cell lysates (Fig. 2B,
lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10), EGF stimulation induced substantial
phosphorylation of EGFR (Fig. 2B, lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11). Blotting
with phospho-specific antibodies detected tyrosine phosphorylation of Y845, the target of Src kinase activity, and Y1068 an EGFR
autophosphorylation site, in parental cells and all transductants
(Fig. 2A and B). Compared with c-Src or EGFR single transductants, EGFR phosphorylation in EGFR plus c-Src double
transductants was markedly increased. The EGF-induced Y845
phosphorylation was markedly reduced in the presence of a Src
kinase inhibitor PP2 (34), used at a concentration (3 Amol/L) that
fully inhibited c-Src Y416 autophosphorylation (Supplementary
Fig. S1A and B), in parental 16A5 and its transductants, whereas
Y1068 phosphorylation was minimally or not affected (Fig. 2A,
compare lanes 3 and 4, lanes 7 and 8, lanes 11 and 12, and lanes
15 and 16). Conversely, when the cells were treated with an EGFR
inhibitor AG1478 at 1 Amol/L (see Supplementary Fig. S1C for
dose-response), overall EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR as
well as Y845 and Y1068 phosphorylation were markedly reduced

Figure 1. Western blot analysis of EGFR, c-Src, and ErbB2 overexpression in
16A5 and MCF10A transductants. 16A5 (A) and MCF10A (B) cells were starved
for 48 h by culturing them in EGF-deficient D3 medium and lysed in a buffer
containing 0.5% Triton. 50 Ag lysate protein were analyzed by Western blotting
with anti-EGFR antibody (Ab-10), anti-ErbB2, and anti-Src antibodies and
reprobed with anti-h-actin antibody to verify equal loading.

(Fig. 2B, lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12). The specificity of c-Src–dependent
Y845 phosphorylation was further supported by the loss of pY845
signal, but not the pY1068 signal, in 16A5 cells overexpressing
EGFR and kinase-inactive K297R c-Src mutant (Fig. 2B, lanes 13–
15) when compared with a co-overexpressed wild-type c-Src
(Fig. 2B, lanes 10–12; for expression levels of K297R c-Src mutant,
see Supplementary Fig. S1D). Notably, the increase in EGFR Y1068
phosphorylation seen with c-Src overexpression was not reversed
by the c-Src inhibitor or the kinase-inactive c-Src. Together, the
analyses of EGFR Y845 phosphorylation using a Src inhibitor and
kinase-inactive c-Src mutant clearly showed biochemical cooperation between overexpressed EGFR and c-Src in human MECs.
We observed that phosphorylation of EGFR Y992 and Y1173 was
also elevated in EGFR plus c-Src co-overexpressing cells compared
with vector-transduced parental cells (Fig. 2C). Because Y992
and Y1173 are known to bind PLCg1 (35) and Shc, respectively
(36), we asked if these pathways were altered. Indeed, higher levels
of phosphorylated Shc were observed in EGFR plus c-Src cooverexpressing cells (Fig. 2C), and phosphorylated PLCg1 levels
remained elevated longer in EGFR plus c-Src double transductants
(Fig. 2C). EGFR stimulation is also known to activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT and STAT pathways (37, 38).
Immunoblotting revealed elevated and prolonged phosphorylation
of AKT, STAT3, and STAT5b in EGFR plus c-Src co-overexpressing
cells (Fig. 2D). Collectively, these findings validated the use of
model cell lines generated here to further assess the biological
cooperation between c-Src and EGFR in MECs.
c-Src overexpression disrupts acinar structure and induces
branching morphogenesis in EGFR-overexpressing MECs
grown in three-dimensional Matrigel culture. Three-dimensional culture on matrices, such as Matrigel, can reveal subtle
biological alterations associated with early oncogenic transformation of MECs (32, 39). Therefore, we used the three-dimensional
Matrigel culture, with a base layer of 100% and cells plated on top in
2% Matrigel (overlay Matrigel culture method; ref. 22) to assess the
biological synergism between co-overexpressed EGFR and c-Src in
human MECs. Phase-contrast microscopy on day 12 showed that
16A5 cells (Fig. 3A, a), similar to MCF10A cells (Fig. 3B, a), formed
predominantly regular acinar structures. The 16A5 and MCF10A
cells transduced with control vectors (Puro, Hygro, or Puro plus
Hygro) were indistinguishable from their respective parental cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Although c-Src–overexpressing cells
showed no discernible difference from control cells (Fig. 3A and
B, b), EGFR overexpression increased the proportion of irregular
acini (Fig. 3A and B, c). In contrast to the relatively mild effect of
singly overexpressed EGFR or c-Src, MECs co-overexpressing EGFR
and c-Src showed a dramatic shift towards irregular and hypercellullar acini, with a marked increase in the proportion of acini with
branching morphogenesis (Fig. 3A and B, d and C). The glandular
epithelial tissues, such as the breast, are comprised of cells that
exhibit a characteristic polarity, with apical poles pointing towards
the central lumen. This polarity, identifiable by apical and basal
membrane markers, is often disrupted in carcinomas (27). Hence, to
characterize the acinar architecture further and to assess the MEC
polarity, we cultured MEC acini for 20 days in three-dimensional
and analyzed them for a6 integrin (basal marker) and E-cadherin
(basolateral marker; ref. 22) localization using confocal immunofluorescence imaging. The parental 16A5 as well as MCF10A acini
were comprised of a layer of polarized epithelial cells surrounding a
lumen (Fig. 4A and B, a and f ), as reported by others for MCF10A
and other immortal nontumorigenic MECs (32). Notably, the

Figure 2. Biochemical cooperation between EGFR and c-Src in human MEC. A, parental 16A5 cells and the indicated transductants were deprived of EGF for 48 h and
preincubated for 2 h with DMSO or Src inhibitor PP2 (3 Amol/L) before stimulation with EGF (10 ng/mL) for 30 min, as indicated. 250 Ag aliquots of lysate protein
were immunoprecipitated (IP ) with anti-EGFR antibody 528 and immunoblotted (IB ) with antibodies against EGFR pY845, EGFR pY1068, and total pY. pY845 blot was
reprobed with anti-EGFR antibody to assess total EGFR levels in each lane. B, parental 16A5, c-Src, EGFR, EGFR plus wild-type c-Src, or EGFR plus kinase-inactive
K297R mutant c-Src–overexpressing cells were deprived of EGF for 48 h, left untreated or preincubated for 2 h with AG1478 (1 Amol/L) followed by EGF
stimulation (10 ng/mL) for 30 min, as indicated. Whole-cell lysate protein (50 Ag) was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane,
and immunoblotted with antibodies against EGFR pY845, EGFR pY1068, total pY, EGFR, and Src. The blot was reprobed with anti-h-actin antibody to verify equal
loading. C, top, 16A5 co-overexpressing EGFR plus c-Src and the puro plus hygro vector control cells were deprived of EGF for 48 h followed by EGF stimulation
(10 ng/mL) for 10, 30, 90, and 270 min as indicated. Aliquots (250 Ag) of lysate protein were immunoprecipitated with anti-EGFR antibody 528 and immunoblotted
with antibodies against pY1173 and pY992 of EGFR and reprobed with anti-EGFR antibody to assess EGFR levels in each lane. Bottom, equal aliquots of lysate
proteins were probed with antibodies against phosphorylated Shc and PLCg1. The blots were reprobed with Shc and PLCg1 to assess their total levels. The h-actin level
is shown as a loading control. D, 16A5 co-overexpressing EGFR plus c-Src and the puro plus hygro vector control cells were deprived of EGF for 48 h, followed by
EGF stimulation for various time as in (C ). Equal amount of cell lysate protein was probed with antibodies against pAKT, pSTAT3, and pSTAT5b. Blots were
reprobed for respective total protein levels. h-Actin levels are shown as a loading control.

overexpression of c-Src alone did not alter the overall acinar
structure or disrupt the polarity (Fig. 4A and B, b and g ). The
overexpression of EGFR alone resulted in a higher frequency of
larger acini with increased numbers of cells in acini and partially
filled lumens; however, the polarity, as determined with E-cadherin
and a6 integrin staining, was maintained (Fig. 4A and B, c and h).
Strikingly, EGFR plus c-Src co-overexpressing cells stained aberrantly for a6 integrin and E-cadherin, indicating a dramatic loss of
polarity (Fig. 4A and B, d and i). In comparison, MECs with ErbB2

overexpression showed a predominance of irregular and hyperproliferative acini, as anticipated from earlier studies (12), with a
substantial proportion of branched acini (Fig. 3A and B, e; Fig. 4A
and B, e and j); notably, whereas ErbB2 overexpression alone
induced substantially more branched acini and loss of polarity compared with EGFR overexpression, these changes were more pronounced in EGFR plus c-Src co-overexpressing MECs (Fig. 4A and B,
compare d and i with e and j). Overall, the co-overexpression of
c-Src dramatically enhanced the hyperproliferation and promoted

the formation of branched structures and loss of polarity in EGFRoverexpressing MECs grown in three-dimensional culture (Fig. 3C;
Fig. 4A and B, d and i). The phenotypes of c-Src, EGFR, or EGFR plus
c-Src overexpression were comparable in 16A5 and MCF10A cells,
indicating that these are not restricted to a particular cell line.
Culture of the MECs in the presence of PP2 led to a dramatic
reversion of the phenotypic abnormalities induced by EGFR, EGFR
plus c-Src, or ErbB2 overexpression; this was indicated by the
reduced size of acini and a drastic reduction in the proportion
of irregular, hyperproliferative, and branched acinar structures
(Fig. 3A and B, f–j and Fig. 3C and D) as well as by the restoration
of cell polarity (Supplementary Fig. S3). Thus, Src activity is critical
for abnormal acinar structure induced by EGFR, EGFR plus c-Src,
or ErbB2 overexpression.
c-Src overexpression enhances the migration of MECs in
response to EGF. Src-family kinases play a key role in cell
migration (40). As abnormally polarized acini of c-Src and EGFR
co-overexpressing MECs were often surrounded by apparently
migratory cells, we quantified the influence of c-Src on migration
specifically triggered upon EGFR activation. Untreated or PP2treated 16A5 cells or various transductants were subjected to

migration assay as described in Materials and Methods. As
anticipated, substantial migration was observed in parental 16A5
cells only when EGF was added to the lower chamber (Fig. 5A, D3
versus D3 + EGF), consistent with the role of EGFR activation to
trigger epithelial cell migration (41). EGF-induced migration was
markedly reduced by PP2, indicative of a critical role of endogenous
c-Src in EGF-induced MEC migration. Furthermore, 16A5 cells
overexpressing c-Src alone showed a substantial increase in EGFinduced cell migration, and cells co-overexpressing EGFR plus c-Src
showed a significantly higher level of migration compared with the
c-Src–overexpressing (P = 0.0214) and the EGFR-overexpressing
cells (P = 0.0066). As with the parental cells, EGF-induced migration
was dramatically reduced by PP2 treatment of c-Src, EGFR, or EGFR
plus c-Src–overexpressing MECs (Fig. 5A). Thus, c-Src and EGFR
cooperatively enhance the MEC migration, and c-Src activity is
essential for the enhanced cell migration.
EGFR and c-Src co-overexpression renders human MECs
invasive. In view of the c-Src–enhanced MEC migration, and the
reported induction of invasive characteristics by unregulated Src
activity (e.g., by v-Src; ref. 15), we examined if c-Src and EGFR cooverexpression promoted the invasiveness of MECs by analyzing cell

transductants were seeded in 2% Matrigel

media without (a–e ) or with (f–j ) PP2
(3 Amol/L) every 3 d. After 12 d, acini were
photographed under a phase-contrast
microscope. The acini with regular
(smooth and spherical shape), irregular
(irregular outline, multilobular), or branched
morphology were enumerated and plotted
as a percentage of total counted, in the
absence (C ) or presence of PP2 (D );
a minimum of 120 acini were counted for
each cell line.

Mammary Cell Transformation by c-Src and EGFR

Figure 4. Disruption of epithelial polarity in
three-dimensional acini upon EGFR and
c-Src co-overexpression in 16A5 and
MCF10A cells. Matrigel cultures were
carried out as in Fig. 3. At day 20, the
cultures were fixed and stained with
anti-E-cadherin (green, a–e ) and anti-a6
integrin (red, f–j ). Nuclei were stained with
4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI ).

migration through Matrigel. As anticipated, parental 16A5 cells
exhibited a low level of Matrigel invasion that was inhibited by PP2
(Fig. 5B). Notably, there was little enhancement of basal invasion
upon c-Src overexpression. EGFR-overexpressing cells showed a
modest increase in invasion, whereas ErbB2-overexpressing cells
showed a somewhat higher level of invasion. Remarkably, the EGFR
and c-Src co-overexpressing cells exhibited a dramatic increase in
invasion, substantially greater than that for ErbB2-overexpressing
cells (Fig. 5B). The invasive behavior of EGFR plus c-Src–overexpressing as well as the single transductants was inhibited by PP2,
consistent with the critical role of Src activity in the enhanced
invasion.
EGFR and c-Src co-overexpression promotes the anchorageindependent growth of MECs. As reported with normal MECs
and immortal nontumorigenic lines, such as MCF10A or HPV16
E6/E7–immortalized MECs (20, 21), 16A5 cells formed few (usually
<10 per 105 cells) colonies when grown on soft agar (Fig. 6A, a).
16A5 cells overexpressing c-Src were comparable (Fig. 6A, b),
whereas EGFR overexpression led to a small but detectable
increase in colony formation (Fig. 6A, c), and ErbB2 overexpression
resulted in a more robust increase (Fig. 6A, e). Notably, the cooverexpression of EGFR and c-Src substantially increased the soft
agar colony-forming ability of 16A5 cells (Fig. 6A, d) and also led
to substantially larger colonies (see insets in Fig. 6A, compare
c with d), with many colonies showing loosely attached cells near
the periphery of the colony, suggestive of migrating/invasive cells
(see higher magnification in Fig. 6A, d). This was in contrast to
smaller and compact colonies observed formed by parental and
EGFR-overexpressing 16A5 cells, and even ErbB2-overexpressing
16A5 cells formed more compact colonies.
Similar analyses using MCF10A transductants showed that the
parental cells essentially lacked anchorage-independent growth; very
low level of colony formation was observed in cells overexpressing EGFR or ErbB2 but more readily in cells co-overexpressing
EGFR and c-Src (Fig. 6B and C). Overall, fewer colonies were
obtained in MCF10A transductants possibly because they lack a

permissive milieu created by the HPV E6 and E7 (22). Importantly,
colony formation in both cell panels was significantly inhibited by
PP2 (Fig. 6A and B, f–j), establishing its c-Src dependence.
EGFR and c-Src co-overexpression is insufficient to drive
in vivo tumor formation. Because the in vitro phenotypic changes
induced by the co-overexpression of EGFR and c-Src suggested that
these cells were transformed, we injected these cells s.c. near the
mammary fat pad of female nude mice to determine whether they
could form tumors in immunocompromised mice. Although almost
all animals inoculated with transformed MECs, HMLER (29) and
Ma-6-Ras (42), used as positive controls, formed tumors within
8 weeks of inoculation (5 of 5 for HMLER, 4 of 5 for Ma-6-Ras),
none of the animals implanted with parental 16A5 or its c-Src,
EGFR, or EGFR plus c-Src–overexpressing derivatives developed
tumors even after 8 months of observation. Thus, EGFR plus c-Src
are insufficient to promote MEC growth as xenotransplant tumors
in immunocompromised mice.
Overall, the analyses of three-dimensional acinar structure and
polarity together with functional indicators of early oncogenesis
show that co-overexpressed EGFR and c-Src biologically cooperate
to promote early oncogenic phenotypes in human MECs.

Discussion
Although ErbB receptors are now well accepted as key players
during oncogenesis of mammary and other epithelial tissues, the
signaling pathways relevant to epithelial cell oncogenesis remain
unclear because nearly all studies have been done in non-epithelial
cell models or in metastatic tumor cells. Here, we have modeled, for
the first time, the co-overexpression of EGFR and c-Src, clinically
observed in human breast cancers, in immortalized nontumorigenic
human MECs. Analyses of oncogenic traits using biologically relevant and sensitive three-dimensional culture in Matrigel, together
with functional assays of in vitro oncogenesis, showed that c-Src
overexpression can markedly enhance the ability of EGFR to promote oncogenic traits in MECs. These traits resemble those observed

with the overexpression of ErbB2, generally recognized as a more
potent epithelial transforming oncogene. Thus, biological modifiers,
such as c-Src, can dramatically exaggerate the output of oncogenic
signals downstream of EGFR, and the model presented here should
facilitate the identification and characterization of such modifiers.
Controlled dimerization of ectopic ErbB2 but not EGFR was
previously shown to reinitiate proliferation of growth-arrested
MCF10A acini, whereas comparable growth promoting effects of
EGFR or ErbB2 dimerization were seen in two-dimensional culture
(12). Compared with these findings, we observed a modest degree
of hyperproliferation and irregular acini as well as partial luminal
filling with constitutive EGFR overexpression (Fig. 4), likely
reflecting the constitutive overexpression of EGFR in our system.
However, the effects of EGFR overexpression alone were far less
drastic compared with those of ErbB2, which induced irregular and
hyperproliferative acini and also induced marked loss of polarity
with branching morphogenesis in a substantial proportion of acini.
Importantly, the c-Src co-overexpression with EGFR not only
increased the proportion of hyperproliferative and irregular acini
but also increased the proportion of acini with branching
morphogenesis (Figs. 3 and 4) above the levels seen in ErbB2
transductants. The phenotypic alterations induced by ErbB2
overexpression are also exaggerated by c-Src (data not shown),
suggesting a general positive modifier role c-Src in ErbB receptor–
mediated mammary oncogenesis. This suggestion is consistent
with the activation of Src in ErbB2-driven transgenic mouse

Figure 5. Cooperative enhancement of MEC migration and invasion towards

The number of cells that migrated across the Transwell membrane in the absence
or presence of PP2 (in both chambers at 3 Amol/L) was assessed after 5 h. For
each cell line, triplicate samples were assayed, and migrated cells were counted

mammary tumors as well as Src overexpression in ErbB2overexpressing breast cancers (14, 43). c-Src–like modifiers could
play a more critical role in the case of weaker oncogenes, such as
EGFR, compared with potent oncogenes such as ErbB2 (10, 11).
Similar to ErbB2 overexpression, EGFR plus c-Src induced a loss of
cell polarity as shown by mislocalization of basal integrin and
basolateral E-cadherin. Importantly, analyses using a c-Src inhibitor
support the conclusion that hyperproliferation as well as loss of
polarity induced by EGFR plus c-Src overexpression required c-Src
activity. E-cadherin is the major adherens junction adhesion protein
expressed by epithelial cells and is known to play an important role
in the maintenance of cell polarity (44). Disruption of E-cadherin–
mediated adhesion is associated with progression of noninvasive
tumors to an invasive stage (45). Although mechanisms by which
c-Src might regulate E-cadherin in MECs in three-dimensional
remain unclear, analyses in other epithelial cells show that activated
Src can enhance the down-regulation of E-cadherin, often in
conjunction with EGFR stimuli, through ubiquitin-dependent
endocytosis and lysosomal degradation (46). However, E-cadherin
protein levels were not altered by c-Src or EGFR plus c-Src
overexpression in our studies (Supplementary Fig. S5). Consistent
with a role of Src in E-cadherin–mediated cell-cell adhesion, Src
inhibitor PP2 was shown to promote the aggregation of breast
cancer cells in vitro (47), whereas c-Src activation in hepatocellular
carcinoma cells deregulated E-cadherin function (48). Elevated c-Src
activity can also cause several components of the adherens junctions
to redistribute to integrin-based adhesion complexes (15). As
endogenous (in ErbB2 or EGFR single transductants) as well as
overexpressed c-Src seemed important for ErbB receptor–driven
perturbations of MEC polarity, the model system described here
should help dissect the cell biological and biochemical pathways
linking c-Src to E-cadherin function in a tractable system relevant to
human epithelial cancers.
Compared with relatively little phenotypic alteration in threedimensional acinar structure, c-Src overexpression alone induced a
substantial increase in Transwell migration response to EGF
exceeding that induced by EGFR overexpression (Fig. 5). The effects
of EGFR and c-Src co-overexpression were not dramatic in this assay
as we observed at best an additive effect. However, the more stringent
Matrigel invasion assay showed that EGFR plus c-Src overexpression
dramatically promoted the invasive behavior of MECs (Fig. 5).
Invasion through the basement membrane requires matrix degrading
activities in addition to enhanced migration (15), suggesting that
cooperative signaling by c-Src and EGFR may be critical to trigger the
release of appropriate proteolytic enzymes at the cell-matrix interface. This idea is consistent with the induction of matrix-degrading
metalloproteases upon overexpression of v-Src in many cell systems
(15). The model described here should help explore the mechanistic
basis for c-Src–dependent invasive traits of human MECs.
Biological cooperativity between co-overexpressed EGFR and
c-Src (Supplementary Fig. S4) was further evident in the ability of
doubly transduced MECs to undergo anchorage-independent
growth, a trait commonly used to gauge the oncogenicity of cells
in vitro. Clear increase in soft agar colony formation was seen with
EGFR plus c-Src overexpression (Fig. 6), and as with threedimensional acinar abnormalities, colony formation was inhibited
by the Src inhibitor PP2, indicating its Src dependence. Finally,
in vivo xenotransplant studies indicate that EGFR plus c-Src cooverexpression does not result in full tumorigenic transformation
of MECs, unlike the rodent fibroblast system (16). This result is
reminiscent of the inability of other rodent fibroblast-transforming

Figure 6. EGFR and c-Src cooperate to
promote anchorage-independent growth of
MECs in soft agar: 105 (for 16A5; A) or
5  105 (for MCF10A; B) parental cells or

oncogenes, such as activated Ras, to fully transform immortalized
human MECs (29). Future analyses using the present system should
identify cancer-relevant genes whose perturbations together with
EGFR overexpression promote full oncogenesis of human MECs.
Notably, similar to the rodent fibroblast system as well as c-Src–
overexpressing epithelial tumor cell lines, c-Src overexpression in
nontumorigenic human MECs enhanced the phosphorylation of
EGFR on Y845, a highly conserved activation loop tyrosine that is
uniquely phosphorylated by Src (3). The c-Src dependence of Y845
phosphorylation in MECs was supported by its abrogation upon
c-Src inhibitor treatment and expression of a kinase-inactive c-Src
(Fig. 2A and B). In contrast, the enhanced phosphorylation on
Y1068 of EGFR was not reversed by the Src inhibitor and was seen
upon co-overexpression of wild-type as well as kinase-inactive c-Src
(Fig. 2B). This kinase-independent enhancement of EGFR Y1068 is
likely to be due to general protection of phosphorylation sites on
EGFR by the bound SH2 domain of c-Src or its mutant; consistent
with this suggestion, the effect of c-Src overexpression was lost
when EGFR kinase activity was inhibited (Fig. 2A).
Recent studies have linked EGFR pY845 to STAT activation and
cell proliferation as well as to potential regulation of apoptosis
through pY845-mediated interaction with mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 2 (49). Our initial analyses are consistent with
enhanced STAT activation in EGFR plus c-Src co-overexpressing
MECs, which also exhibit increased PI3K and Shc pathway
activation (Fig. 2C and D). Given the recently shown roles of
STAT proteins and PI3K mutations in mammary development

www.aacrjournals.org

and breast cancer (37, 38, 50), further studies using the present
model should provide a more relevant system to dissect these
oncogenic signaling pathways compared with traditional fibroblast and other model cellular systems. The simple assay systems
that revealed the cooperative oncogenic progression in human
MECs co-overexpressing EGFR and c-Src should be adaptable for
high-throughput screening to identify additional modifiers of
EGFR-mediated oncogenesis, screen for chemical inhibitors, and
dissect oncogenic ErbB receptor signaling using ectopic gene
expression or knockdown strategies.
