ABSTRACT
Trastuzumab is widely used in the clinical treatment of human epidermal growth
factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer, but the patient response rate is low.
CD147 stimulates cancer cell proliferation, migration, metastasis and differentiation
and is involved in chemoresistance in many types of cancer cells. Whether CD147
alters the effect of trastuzumab on HER2-positive breast cancer cells has not been
previously reported. Our study confirmed that CD147 suppression enhances the
effects of trastuzumab both in vitro and in vivo. CD147 suppression increased the
inhibitory rate of trastuzumab and cell apoptosis in SKBR3, BT474, HCC1954 and MDAMB453 cells compared with the controls. Furthermore, CD147 knockdown increased
expression of cleaved Caspase-3/9 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and
decreased both mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt phosphorylation
in the four cell lines. In an HCC1954 xenograft model, trastuzumab achieved greater
suppression of tumor growth in the CD147-knockdown group than in the shRNA
negative control (NC) group. These data indicated that enhancement of the effect of
trastuzumab on HER2-positive cells following CD147 knockdown might be attributed
to increased apoptosis and decreased phosphorylation of signaling proteins. CD147
may be a key protein for enhancing the clinical efficacy of trastuzumab.

objective response rate to trastuzumab is only 30%, and
most breast cancer patients with high HER2 expression
do not respond to trastuzumab treatment [3, 4]. Hence,
efforts to improve drug treatment efficacy have received
widespread attention. The goals of these efforts have
included elucidation of the underlying mechanisms [4],
identification of the synergistic effects of new target
proteins [5], and the construction of bispecific or multispecific antibodies.
CD147, or HAb18G, a transmembrane glycoprotein,
is a member of the human immunoglobulin superfamily
[6-8]. It promotes tumor invasion, growth and metastasis
by stimulating matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) synthesis
in neighboring fibroblasts [9] and inhibiting cell apoptosis
[10]. In addition, it promotes chemoresistance in different

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is one of the major malignancies
threatening womenʼs health. Worldwide, approximately
1.2 million new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed, and
approximately 500,000 women die of breast cancer each
year. HER2 (ErbB2 or NEU), a member of the ErbB family
of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), is the main pathogenic
gene in breast cancer; HER2 overexpression has been
demonstrated in 20 to 30% of patients [1, 2]. Trastuzumab
(Herceptin), a humanized monoclonal antibody against
HER2 developed by Genentech, was approved by the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment high
HER2-expression breast cancer in 1998. However, the

cancer cell types, including breast cancer cells [11-15], by
stimulating hyaluronan production [16]. In hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) and breast cancer, CD147 increases
multi-drug resistance-1 and MMP-11 expression [12,
17-19]. Moreover, CD147 correlates with epidermal
growth factor receptor activity in association with tumor
chemoresistance in a cancer stem cell-like cell line derived
from breast cancer cells [20]. However, wheher CD147
is related to antibody drug efficacy has not yet been
elucidated.
In this study, we investigated whether CD147
alters the efficacy of trastuzumab against HER2-positive
cancer in both trastuzumab-sensitive and -resistant breast
cancer cell lines via CD147 knockdown and preliminarily
explored the underlying mechanism. We also assessed the
effect of CD147 on the antitumor efficacy of trastuzumab
in a breast cancer xenograft model. Our results may
provide insights for improving the efficacy of trastuzumab
in HER2-positive breast cancer patients.

MDA-MB453 cells. We also detected CD147 expression
in cancer cells by immunofluorescence (IF) and
immunocytochemistry (ICC) (Figure 2C), demonstrating
similar results as those described above in the four cell
lines. According to the literature, HCC1954 and MDAMB453 are always regarded as trastuzumab-resistant cell
lines, and BT474 and SKBR3 are regarded as trastuzumabsensitive cell lines. Therefore, we chose these four cell
lines for further study.

CD147 expression is decreased by specific
siRNAs in HER2-positive breast cancer cells
The effects of specific siRNAs (Table 1) on CD147
expression were first evaluated by real-time polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results indicated that CD147
expression was significantly decreased in the CD147si2- and
CD147si3-treated groups compared with the CD147si1treated, control and siRNA NC groups in BT474, SKBR3,
MDA-MB453 and HCC1954 cells (Figure 3A, p≤0.01).
Western blot analysis also confirmed that CD147si2 and
CD147si3 decreased the CD147 protein levels in the four cell
lines (Figure 3B). Thus, we chose CD147si2 and CD147si3
to inhibit CD147 expression in further experiments.

CD147 knockdown enhances the inhibitory effect
of trastuzumab in HER2-positive cancer cells

CD147 is expressed at a high level in cancer
tissues and at a low level in normal tissues [21]. CD147
and HER2 expression in 271 breast cancer samples,
as demonstrated by streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase
immunohistochemistry (S-P IHC) analysis, has been
previously reported [22, 23]. Here, we also detected
CD147 and HER2 expression in 10 clinical breast
cancer tissue samples (including 9 HER2-positive
samples) by IHC to provide a foundation for subsequent
analyses. The staining results for one sample are
presented in Figure 1 (the rest of the results are shown in
Supplementary Figure S1). CD147 and HER2 were mainly
expressed on membranes. According to our results, CD147
was highly expressed in HER2-positive breast cancer
tissues, verifying that CD147 and HER2 are frequently
simultaneously expressed in HER2-positive breast cancer
tissues in vivo.

To further understand the role of CD147, we
investigated whether the suppression of CD147 expression
by two specific siRNAs altered the response of HER2positive cancer cells to trastuzumab using different
concentrations and treatment times. The morphologies and
numbers of SKBR3, BT474, HCC1954 and MDA-MB453
cells were altered following trastuzumab treatment for 96 h.
Here, we only display the changes in SKBR3 and HCC1954
cells as representatives (Figure 4A). First, we examined
the responses of the four cell lines to treatments with
different concentrations of trastuzumab for 96 h by CCK-8
assay (Figure 4B) to determine the optimal concentration.
Interestingly, at 0 μg/mL trastuzumab, siRNA-mediated
silencing of CD147 improved the responses of the resistant
cell lines HCC1954 and MDA-MB453 to trastuzumab
compared with the control cells (parental and siRNA NCtreated cells), whereas the sensitive cell lines SKBR3 and
BT474 displayed the opposite responses, although no
significance differences were detected compared with the
controls in the four cell lines. However, starting at 0.1 μg/
mL trastuzumab, the CD147-knockdown-plus-trastuzumab
treatment significantly inhibited cell proliferation in a dosedependent manner compared with the CD147-knockdown
or trastuzumab treatment alone in both the resistant and
sensitive cell lines (p<0.05 in SKBR3, HCC1954 and
MDA-MB453 cells; p<0.001 in BT474 cells), although
the sensitive SKBR3 and BT474 cells maintained strong
reactions to trastuzumab treatment alone, while the resistant
HCC1954 and MDA-MB453 cells displayed weak reactions

Verification of CD147 and HER2 expression in
HER2-positive cancer cells
To further confirm the IHC results, we performed
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to analyze
CD147 and HER2 expression in different HER2-positive
breast cancer cell lines (Figure 2A, 2B). High CD147
expression and low HER2 expression were observed in
JIMT-1 and HCC1954 cells, and moderate expression
of both CD147 and HER2 was detected in SKBR3
cells. Further, moderate CD147 expression and high
HER2 expression were observed in BT474 cells, and
low expression of both CD147 and HER2 was found in

CD147 knockdown induces HER2-positive
cancer cell apoptosis under trastuzumab
treatment

There were no significant differences in the treatment
responses between the two control groups in the four cell
lines. Following treatment with 10 μg/mL trastuzumab, the
inhibition rates were approximately 50% in the CD147knockdown groups of SKBR3 and BT474 cells; therefore,
a concentration of 10 μg/mL was used in subsequent
experiments, except for the HCC1954 and MDA-MB453
cell treatments, for which 100 μg/mL was used.
Then, time-dependent analysis was performed the
four cell lines (Figure 4C). For each treatment time, the
trends in cell proliferation were similar to those observed
in dose-dependent analysis in the four cell lines. The only
difference was that the inhibition rates in the CD147knockdown groups were markedly increased compared
with those in the control groups of BT474 and SKBR3
cells (p<0.001) and HCC1954 cells (p<0.05) following
the 3-day treatment, whereas in MDA-MB453 cells, such
enhancement was observed following the 4-day treatment
(p<0.01). No significant differences in the inhibition rates
were noted between the siRNA NC and control groups in
the four cell lines.
These results suggest that CD147 knockdown
and trastuzumab have an additive effect on inhibition of
HER2-positive breast cancer cell viability.

We also assessed apoptosis of SKBR3, BT474,
HCC1954 and MDA-MB453 cells following trastuzumab
treatment using Annexin V (AV) and propidium iodide
(PI) staining. Here, we only present the AV and PI staining
of SKBR3 and HCC1954 cells as representatives of
sensitive and resistant cells, respectively (Figure 5A).
Apoptosis was increased in the CD147-knockdown and
CD147-knockdown-plus-trastuzumab groups compared
with the control groups in the four cell lines (Figure 5B).
Furthermore, only CD147-knockdown treatment notably
enhanced apoptosis compared with the control groups
especially in SKBR3 and BT474 cells. Under trastuzumab
treatment alone, apoptosis was unpredictably strongly
increased in the sensitive SKBR3 and BT474 cells, whereas
it was markedly decreased in the resistant HCC1954
(p<0.05) and MDA-MB453 (p<0.05) cells compared with
control cells. Moreover, compared with CD147-knockdown
treatment alone, CD147-knockdown-plus-trastuzumab
treatment increased apoptosis in SKBR3 (p<0.01) and
HCC1954 (p<0.05) cells, and this result was not observed

in BT474 or MDA-MB453 cells. However, compared with
trastuzumab treatment alone, CD147-knockdown-plustrastuzumab treatment significantly increased apoptosis in
the four cell lines. These findings indicated that inhibition
of CD147 resulted in high rates of apoptosis in SKBR3
and BT474 cells and especially in trastuzumab-resistant
HCC1954 and MDA-MB453 cells, which might be the
primary reason that CD147 knockdown improved the
efficacy of trastuzumab. No significant differences in
apoptosis were noted between the siRNA NC and parental
cell groups in the four cell lines.
Furthermore, we detected the levels of apoptotic
proteins in the four cell lines (Figure 5C). Consistent
with the above results, cleaved Caspase-3/9 and cleaved
PARP were increased only in the CD147-knockdown
and CD147-knockdown-plus-trastuzumab treatment
groups compared with the control groups, regardless of

trastuzumab treatment. In particular, the levels of cleaved
Caspase-3/9 were markedly altered in SKBR3 cells, in
addition to the levels of cleaved Caspase-9 and PARP
in BT474 and MDA-MB453 cells and those of cleaved
Caspase-3 and PARP in HCC1954 cells. There were no
significant differences in the levels of apoptotic proteins
between the two control groups in the four cell lines.

Inhibition of CD147 decreases MAPK and/
or Akt phosphorylation during trastuzumab
treatment in different HER2-positive breast
cancer cells
The MAPK/Erk or PI3K/Akt pathway is the primary
downstream signaling pathway inhibited by trastuzumab
in HER2-positive cancer cells [4]. Thus, we examined
changes in the phosphorylation of MAPK and Akt before

and after trastuzumab treatment for 1 h in SKBR3,
BT474, HCC1954 and MDA-MB453 cells. As shown in
Figure 6, CD147-knockdown or trastuzumab treatment
alone decreased MAPK phosphorylation compared
with the untreated control groups in the four cell lines.
Moreover, CD147-knockdown-plus-trastuzumab treatment
dramatically decreased MAPK phosphorylation compared

HCC1954-sh483 cells were screened from stable CD147
knockdown cell lines established in HCC1954 cells using
the shRNA interference method (Supplementary Figure
S2). Trastuzumab exhibited increased suppression of
tumor growth in the CD147-knockdown group compared
the shRNA NC group in the HCC1954 xenograft model
(Figure 7). Notably, based on the IHC results in tumor
tissues, CD147 expression was suppressed in CD147knockdown group compared with shRNA NC group
(Figure 7A), in accordance with the in vitro results
(Supplementary Figure S3). Moreover, CD147-knockdownplus-trastuzumab treatment exhibited greater efficacy
in inhibiting HCC1954 tumor growth than trastuzumab
or CD147-knockdown treatment alone (Figure 7B).
Specifically, compared with no treatment in the shRNA
NC group, CD147-knockdown-plus-trastuzumab treatment
resulted in 38.5% regression of HCC1954 tumors (p<0.01),
and CD147-knockdown treatment alone caused 15%
regression (p<0.05), whereas the trastuzumab treatment
alone resulted in no significant regression. These results
indicated that CD147 knockdown improved the suppressive
effect of trastuzumab on tumor growth in vivo.

have been reported [3, 4]. These findings prompted us to
identify novel ways to improve the efficacy of trastuzumab
treatment in trastuzumab-responsive and unresponsive
patients. CD147 is an important molecule in cancer [21],
and different CD147 expression levels may have different
clinical significance. Overexpression is always correlated
with poor prognosis in certain cancers [24-29]. However,
few reports have demonstrated a link between CD147 and
trastuzumab treatment in HER2-positive breast cancer
cells. Therefore, we first specifically detected CD147
expression and demonstrated that its knockdown improved
the efficacy of trastuzumab in HER2-positive cancer cells.
Our results were consistent with those of previous studies
of CD147 expression in cancer cells using western blotting
[30], and serve as a foundation for further analyses
of relative CD147 expression. CD147-knockdownplus-trastuzumab treatment significantly inhibited cell
proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in vitro and
significantly improved the response of HER2-positive
breast cancer cells to trastuzumab in vivo compared with
the controls. These results indicate that inhibition of
CD147 may be a new strategy for increasing the efficacy
of trastuzumab in the clinical setting.
Next we preliminarily examined how CD147
knockdown improves the efficacy of trastuzumab.
One hypothesis involved altered apoptosis of SKBR3,
BT474, HCC1954 and MDA-MB453 cells in response to
trastuzumab treatment. Caspase-3/9 and PARP cleavages,

as well as AV and PI staining, were enhanced in the CD147knockdown groups compared with the control groups,
indicating that CD147 has an important role in tumor cell
apoptosis. CD147 has been reported to play similar roles in
HCC [10, 31-33], head and neck squamous cell carcinomas
[34], non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) [35], and
ovarian cancer [36]. Following CD147 knockdown,
Caspase-3 is activated in HCC cells [10]; further, increased
Caspase-3 and PARP cleavages occur in human leukemic
monocyte lymphoma U937 cells [37], whereas the addition
of CD147 to melanoma cell lines has been shown to result
in a decrease in Caspase-3/7 activity [38]. However, the
effect of trastuzumab on cell apoptosis has not been well
studied in recent years. Here, we determined the rates of
trastuzumab-induced apoptosis in four parental HER2positive cancer cell lines. We found that trastuzumabinduced apoptosis was decreased in the parental SKBR3
and BT474 cells, similar to previous studies [39, 40], and

it was even decreased in the parental HCC1954 and MDAMB453 cells, which again may demonstrate that these two
cell lines are trastuzumab resistant.
The mechanism underlying the effect of
trastuzumab treatment on HER2-positive cancer cells
primarily involves the MAPK and Akt pathways [4,
7, 8, 41]. CD147 is involved in HCC chemoresistance
through the MAPK/Erk signaling pathway, and it
activates PI3K/Akt signaling to promote tumor invasion
and metastasis [17]. Therefore, we also preliminarily
examined changes in MAPK and Akt phosphorylation
after CD147 knockdown in the presence or absence
of trastuzumab treatment. According to our results,
trastuzumab treatment in the control groups
decreased MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) and Akt (Ser473)
phosphorylation in SKBR3, BT474 and HCC1954 cells
and reduced MAPK phosphorylation in MDA-MB453
cells (which harbor a mutated Akt gene). CD147-

knockdown or CD147-knockdown-plus-trastuzumab
treatment reduced MAPK and Akt phosphorylation in
all four cell lines compared with the controls, indicating
that CD147 knockdown might increase the effects
of trastuzumab on the MAPK and Akt pathways in
HER2-positive breast cancer cells, and the effects of
CD147 knockdown and trastuzumab were overlapping.
However, further studies are needed to determine the
exact mechanism underlying these effects.
CD147 may be clinically significant not only as
a marker of activated regulatory T cells but also as a

potential diagnostic marker of early-stage disease [21] or a
prognostic marker, as reported in endometrial cancer [24],
gastric cancer [25], HCC [27], lupus nephritis [42] and
UCB [28]. CD147 is also an indicator of five-year survival
rate in NSCLC [29]. Another study has demonstrated that
CD147 expression is associated with poor overall survival
in patients with glioblastoma and has suggested that it may
be used to predict the treatment response of glioblastoma
patients [26]. CD147 expression is correlated with
axillary lymph node involvement, TNM (tumor, node,
metastasis) staging and breast cancer HER2 expression

based on S-P IHC analysis (p<0.01, p<0.05 and p<0.01,
respectively) [22]. Our study demonstrated a relationship
between CD147 and antibody drug treatment efficacy,
but further study of the relationship between CD147 and
HER2 is needed. According to our findings, CD147 could
serve as a therapeutic target and a potential indicator of
the response to trastuzumab treatment and prognosis of
HER2-positive breast cancer patients. However, it remains
unclear whether high CD147 expression in HER2-positive
breast cancer is related to a poor response to antibody drug
treatment, and further clinical investigations are needed
to confirm this association. The finding that CD147
knockdown may improve antitumor efficacy in patients
with HER2-positive solid tumors provides a new strategy
for constructing bispecific antibodies against CD147 and
HER2 or adding other effective targets, which will be
extremely significant for clinical tumor immunotherapy
in the future.

using a Microplate Reader (Bio-Rad Model 680). The cell
survival index was calculated as [A490(trastuzumab+)/
A490(trastuzumab−)] · 100%.

Determination of cell apoptosis via AV staining
Control cells or cells treated with 10 μg/mL
trastuzumab were collected and stained with AVphycoerythrin and PI (Becton Dickinson). Apoptotic cell
death was measured by counting the number of cells that
stained positive for AV-phycoerythrin, as determined by
FACS.

Immunohistochemistry
For 3,3-diaminobenzidine staining, paraffinembedded tissue sections were deparaffinized and
stained with antibodies against CD147 and HER2
and then with biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies
(1:1000), followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated
streptavidin (Dianova). The sections were finally
counterstained with hematoxylin. The number of tumors
in each group was quantified in at least 10 random areas
per section. Images were obtained with an OLYMPUS
BX51.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and culture
The human breast cancer cell lines BT474,
SKBR-3, MDA-MB453, HCC1954 and JIMT-1
were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC). All cell lines were identified by
GENEWIZ, Inc. (Beijing, China) and were maintained
in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
except for HCC1954, which was maintained in RPMI
1640 containing 10% FBS at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere with 5% CO2/95% air.

In vivo therapeutic analysis
HCC1954-shRNA NC or HCC1954-sh483 cells (5
× 106 per mouse) were subcutaneously inoculated into the
mammary fat pads of female BALB/c nude mice. When
the tumor volumes reached an average of approximately
100 mm3, the mice were randomly divided into groups
of 10 mice each. They were then intravenously injected
with control human IgG or trastuzumab (10 mg/kg) twice
weekly. Tumors were measured with digital calipers, and
tumor volumes were calculated using the formula volume
= [length × (width)]2 ÷ 2.

Western blot analysis
Cells were harvested in RIPA buffer (Beyotime)
and maintained on ice. After vortexing for 30 sec, the
lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 g for 5
min. The whole-cell protein extracts were analyzed by
Western blotting with the following primary antibodies:
CD147 and β-actin (Abcam), p44/42 MAPK, Akt,
phosphorylated p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (p-MAPK,
Thr202/Tyr204), phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt, Ser473),
Caspase-3, Caspase-9, cleaved Caspase-3 (Asp175)
and 9 (Asp330) and PARP (Asp214) (Cell Signaling
Technology).

Statistical analysis
Experiments were repeated at least three times. Data
were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
or Student’s t-test. A p-value of <0.05 was considered
significant.
