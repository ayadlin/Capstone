Abstract
DNA damage activates Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) to halt cell cycle progression
thereby preventing further DNA replication and mitosis until the damage has been
repaired. Consequently, Chk1 inhibitors have emerged as promising anticancer
therapeutics in combination with DNA damaging drugs, but their single agent
activity also provides a novel approach that may be particularly effective in a subset
of patients. From analysis of a large panel of cell lines, we demonstrate that 15%
are very sensitive to the Chk1 inhibitor MK-8776. Upon inhibition of Chk1, sensitive
cells rapidly accumulate DNA double-strand breaks in S phase in a CDK2- and cyclin
A-dependent manner. In contrast, resistant cells can continue to grow for at least
7 days despite continued inhibition of Chk1. Resistance can be circumvented by
inhibiting Wee1 kinase and thereby directly activating CDK2. Hence, sensitivity to
Chk1 inhibition is regulated upstream of CDK2 and correlates with accumulation of
CDC25A. We conclude that cells poorly tolerate CDK2 activity in S phase and that a
major function of Chk1 is to ensure it remains inactive. Indeed, inhibitors of CDK1 and
CDK2 arrest cells in G1 or G2, respectively, but do not prevent progression through
S phase demonstrating that neither kinase is required for S phase progression.
Inappropriate activation of CDK2 in S phase underlies the sensitivity of a subset of
cell lines to Chk1 inhibitors, and this may provide a novel therapeutic opportunity for
appropriately stratified patients.

INTRODUCTION

requires activation of Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) that
inhibits CDC25 and thereby prevents activation of
CDK1/2 [2]. Consequently, Chk1 inhibitors have been
developed as potential adjuvants to DNA damaging
agents as they circumvent arrest before repair is complete,
drive cells through the cell cycle, and increase cell killing
[2]. In addition, antimetabolites such as gemcitabine
and hydroxyurea deprive cells of deoxyribonucleotides
thereby stalling replication. These stalled replication forks
are stabilized by Chk1, such that inhibition of Chk1 results
in replication fork collapse and DNA double-strand breaks
(DSB) [3, 4]. Wee1 inhibitors have also been shown to
enhance DNA damage-induced cell killing [5, 6]. Whether
either of these approaches can elicit cytotoxicity that is
selective for the tumor cells remains to be established,
although growth suppression in tumor xenografts suggests

In an undamaged cell, progression through G1, S
and G2 phase of the cell cycle is dependent on temporal
activation of cyclin-dependent kinases CDK1 and CDK2
in complex with cyclins E, A and B. CDK1/2 usually
exist in a phosphorylated and inactive form that requires
dephosphoryation for activation at an appropriate time in
the cell cycle. The inhibitory phosphorylation on tyrosine
15 and threonine 14 is catalyzed by Wee1 or Myt1 (also
known as PKMyt1). The subsequent dephosphorylation
and activation of CDK1/2 is mediated by one of three
CDC25 phosphatases (A, B or C) [1].
Many anticancer agents damage DNA thereby
activating a cell cycle checkpoint that arrests cell cycle
progression and permits repair and recovery. The arrest

these approaches are tolerated [4, 7].
Recently, both Chk1 and Wee1 inhibitors have
been shown to have single agent activity in some cell
lines, while the combination of these inhibitors has
been reported to induce synergistic killing [3, 8-10]. We
recently reported that U2OS cells are very sensitive to
short incubation with a low concentration of the Chk1
inhibitor MK-8776 [11]. The DSB that occur in S phase
are the result of Mus81-mediated cleavage of DNA, which
can be prevented by inhibiting the single-strand nuclease
activity of Mre11, which in turn is dependent on CDK1/2
[11]. Here, we set out to determine the extent of sensitivity
in a large panel of cell lines and to define the specific CDK
that is involved in the induction of DSB in cells sensitive
to MK-8776. This necessitated a critical reanalysis of the
methods that discriminate CDK1 from CDK2.
Tumors frequently exhibit oncogene-induced
replicative stress, and it has been suggested that this may
provide a therapeutic opportunity to selectively target
such cells, in particular through inhibition of Chk1 or its
upstream activator kinase ataxia telangiectasia-mutated
and Rad3-related (ATR) [12, 13]. This would suggest a
large proportion of tumors should be sensitive to Chk1
inhibition, yet this is not the case. Only a few cell lines are
sensitive to MK-8776 as a single agent. In contrast, the
majority of cell lines are sensitive to the Wee1 inhibitor
AZD1775 (formerly known as MK-1775). It has also been
suggested that DNA damage induced by either Chk1 or
Wee1 inhibition results from aberrant mitotic entry [5, 14],
yet this is also inconsistent with the observations reported
here. The results suggest that only a subset of cell lines
activate CDK2 in S phase upon incubation with a Chk1
inhibitor, and that this might provide a chemical synthetic
lethal interaction whereby a subset of tumors will respond
to Chk1 inhibitors as monotherapy.

show that the majority of cell lines are resistant (IC50
> 10 µM) and many continue to grow even when MK8776 is left in the media for the entire 7 days (Figure 1A).
These values are comparable to the plasma concentrations
of MK-8776 in patients where a concentration of > 1 µM
was maintained for at least 6 h [15].
Resistance to MK8776 does not appear to be due
to lack of drug bioavailability or defects in Chk1 as these
cell lines can still be sensitized to either hydroxyurea or
gemcitabine when incubated with MK-8776 [3, 4]. To
confirm that Chk1 remained inhibited in the resistant cells
for a long period, we investigated the impact of MK-8776
on response of cells to the topoisomerase I inhibitor SN38
as previously studied [3, 16]. SW620 cells incubated with
SN38 for 24 h arrested in S phase, but when incubated
concurrently with SN38 and either 1 or 10 µM MK8776, the cells arrested in G2, consistent with abrogation
of S phase arrest (Figure 1B). Parallel cell cultures were
plated at low density in the presence of 0, 1 or 10 µM
MK-8776 and allowed to grow for 6 days at which time
SN38 was added for the final 24 h. In the absence of MK8776, SN38 arrested the cells in S phase as expected.
However, cells that had been incubated for 6 days in MK8776 failed to arrest in S phase when SN38 was added,
but rather arrested in G2 consistent with concurrent Chk1
inhibition. A second indication of the activity of Chk1 is
its autophosphorylation on ser296 that is observed after
a 24-h incubation with SN38 (Figure 1B). Concurrent
or 6-day pretreatment with MK-8776 prevented this
phosphorylation. Similar results were obtained with other
resistant cell lines (e.g., ADR-Res and MiaPaCa2; data not
shown). These experiments demonstrate that MK-8776
continued to inhibit Chk1 for at least 7 days yet these
resistant cells continued to proliferate.
A subset of cell lines was selected for further
analysis, and compared for their sensitivity to the Wee1
inhibitor AZD1775 (Figure 1C). While the majority of
cell lines appeared to be sensitive to a short incubation
with AZD1775, a few cell lines appeared to be more
resistant even to continuous exposure. Importantly, most
cell lines that were resistant to MK-8776 were sensitive
to AZD1775. As discussed further below, the cell lines
resistant to AZD1775 were sensitive to incubation with the
broad spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor PD166285 which
inhibits both Wee1 and Myt1 [17] (Figure 1C).

RESULTS
Differential sensitivity of cells to MK-8776 and
AZD1775
We recently demonstrated that several cell lines
are acutely sensitive to the Chk1 inhibitor MK-8776 as a
single agent [3, 4, 11]. We have expanded this analysis to
a large panel of cell lines (Figure 1A). In this cytotoxicity
screen, cells were incubated with drug for either 24 or 48
h, then the drug was removed and incubation continued
to 7 days. Alternately, cells were incubated continuously
for 7 days. Cytotoxicity observed after the shorter
incubations reflects the inability of the cells to recover
after a potentially toxic insult. We show that 11 cell lines
are very sensitive (IC50 < 2 µM) to short incubation with
MK-8776, while another 9 cell lines are sensitive to this
concentration after 48 h incubation. However, we now

mitosis and DNA double-strand breaks
The following experiments were designed to
investigate the mechanisms underlying the differential
response of cells to MK-8776 and AZD1775. We initially
studied the pancreas tumor cell line AsPC-1 which is
acutely sensitive to both drugs, and investigated the
concentration and time required to induce phosphorylation

of RPA and H2AX (this phosphorylation on ser139 is
known as γH2AX) which are commonly used as markers
of single-stranded DNA and DSB, respectively (Figure
2A). γH2AX is occasionally reported to occur in the
absence of DSB although this might be explained by the
recent observation that stalled replication forks can rapidly
regress giving a “one-sided DSB” [18]. We previously
reported that MK-8776 induces γH2AX in U2OS cells that
is associated with the appearance of DSB in the comet
assay [11]. Here, we demonstrate the appearance of DSB
in MK-8776-treated AsPC-1 cells as well (Figure 2B). The
proportion of cells positive for DSB correlated with the
proportion of cells positive for γH2AX by flow cytometry
(Figure 3). We also observed concurrent appearance of
S4/S8-phosphorylated RPA, a substrate of DNA-protein
kinase, which in turn is activated by DSB (Figure 2A).
Incubation of AsPC-1 cells with ≥125 nM AZD1775
for 3 or 6 h caused dephosphorylation of tyrosine 15-

CDK1/2, and the appearance of both γH2AX and
phospho-RPA (Figure 2A). There was also an increase
in phospho-histone H3 (pHH3), a common marker for
mitotic cells. In contrast, MK-8776 induced minimal
dephosphorylation of CDK1/2 or increase in pHH3, but it
still induced γH2AX and phospho-RPA at 250 - 500 nM.
Very similar results were obtained in another sensitive cell
line, ACHN (Supplemental Figure S1).
To further contrast the difference between MK8776 and AZD1775, we performed 2-dimensional flow
cytometry to assess the phase of the cell cycle at which
γH2AX and pHH3 appeared. γH2AX was induced in S
phase cells by both drugs (Figure 3A; compare rows 1
and 2). AZD1775 was about 2-fold more potent than MK8776, and the majority of S phase cells exhibit γH2AX
within 6 h (Supplemental Figure S2). A time course
experiment with MK-8776 demonstrated that, as cells
continue to enter S, they accumulate in early S phase with

high γH2AX (Supplemental Figure S2D). While a small
proportion of untreated cells exhibited pHH3, these were
all in G2/M consistent with a few cells passing through
mitosis. Incubation with AZD1775 but not MK-8776
induced a significant increase in pHH3 that was only
observed in the G2/M population (Figure 3B; compare
rows 1 and 2), and is consistent with activation of the
mitotic CDK1 (and presumably of aurora kinase B which
is the ultimate kinase that phosphorylates pHH3; [19]).
It is important to emphasize that all the γH2AX-positive
cells are in S phase and so are distinct from the pHH3positive cells. Hence, the appearance of γH2AX is not a
consequence of premature mitosis or mitotic catastrophe.
These observations highlight a significant difference
between the two drugs as MK-8776 does not appear to
activate CDK1. We and others have previously reported
that inhibition of CDK1/2 can prevent Chk1-inhibitorinduced γH2AX [11, 20], thereby suggesting that CDK2
is probably responsible for the induction of γH2AX in S
phase cells.
Activation of CDK1 or CDK2 is frequently assessed
as dephosphorylation of tyrosine 15. Unfortunately,
the phosphotyrosine-15-specific antibodies do not
discriminate between CDK1 and CDK2 (despite what
most suppliers state) as the phosphotyrosine resides in the
middle of a 13 amino acid conserved sequence. We have
confirmed this by selectively immunoprecipitating CDK2,
and showing that a purported phosphotyrosine-15-CDK1
antibody detects the phosphorylated CDK2 (Supplemental
Figure S3). The failure to detect dephosphorylation
with MK-8776 (Figure 2; see also Figure 4A) might be
explained by the continued presence of phospho-CDK1
masking any dephosphorylation of CDK2. It has been
reported that CDK1 is present at 10-fold higher levels than
CDK2 [21], so the phospho-CDK2 would represent a very
small proportion of the total phospho-CDK1/2.
To better define the differential involvement of
CDK1 versus CDK2, we used a small molecule inhibitor,
CVT-313, which is reported to be about 10-fold more
selective for CDK2 over CDK1 when tested against
purified kinases [22]. We found that CVT-313 reduced the
number of cells exhibiting γH2AX by 50% around 1 µM
whereas it required about 10 µM to inhibit pHH3 by 50%
(Figure 3). These results were similar whether γH2AX
was induced by AZD1775 or MK-8776. Using the comet
assay, we also demonstrated that CVT-313 prevented the
appearance of MK-8776-induced DSB (Figure 2B).
To contrast these results, we also used Ro3306
which is reported to be about 10-fold more selective for
CDK1 against the purified kinases [23]. However, Ro3306
inhibited both γH2AX and pHH3 at 2.5 µM suggesting
that it does not discriminate between CDK1 and CDK2
in cells (Figure 3E, 3F). This inability of Ro3306 to
preferentially inhibit CDK1 over CDK2 in cells may
be attributable to the far lower level of active CDK2
compared to CDK1 in the cells as discussed above [21].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We further compared the efficacy of CVT-313 and
Ro3306 in otherwise undamaged, but synchronized cells.
CVT-313 was more effective at preventing progression
through G1, but Ro3306 was about equipotent at inducing
G1 and G2 arrest consistent with it inhibiting both CDK1
and CDK2 (Supplemental Figure S4). Importantly, neither
inhibitor appeared to prevent progression through S phase.
The results with Ro3306 require additional comment
as low concentrations caused an increase in pHH3 (Figure
3; Supplemental Figure S4) and an increase in the
proportion of cells in G2/M, which we attribute to partial
inhibition of CDK1 preventing complete passage through
mitosis. The results with Ro3306 are clearly different
than those obtained with CVT-313, and are consistent
with the latter compound preferentially inhibiting CDK2.
These data further support the model whereby γH2AX
is a consequence of CDK2 activation, whereas pHH3 is
a consequence of CDK1 activation. Importantly, MK8776 did not activate CDK1 yet both CVT-313 and
Ro3306 inhibited γH2AX at concentrations that implicate
inhibition of CDK2.

Cyclin E degradation as a marker of CDK2
activity
Neither HH3 nor H2AX is a direct phosphorylation
target of CDK1 or CDK2. We therefore sought a more
direct target. CDK2 complexes with cyclin E and,
when activated, phosphorylates cyclin E resulting in its
degradation [24, 25]. This is exactly what was observed
in several sensitive cell lines (Figure 4A). For example,
U2OS, ACHN, MDA-MB-435 and TK10 cells show
degradation of cyclin E upon incubation with MK8776 and AZD1775. The degradation of cyclin E was
prevented by low concentrations of CVT-313 consistent
with CDK2 inhibition (Figure 4B). Importantly, the
results show the correlation between inhibition of γH2AX
and the accumulation of cyclin E further supporting the
premise that the DNA damage is a consequence of CDK2
activation.
Ro3306 also prevented the degradation of cyclin
E and the appearance of γH2AX at ~2.5 µM which is
consistent with the data above suggesting that Ro3306
also inhibits CDK2 at this concentration. Interestingly,
incubation of these cell lines with either CVT-313 or
Ro3306 alone also induced accumulation of cyclin E
(Figure 4C) suggesting that a basal level of CDK2 activity
provides constitutive turnover of the protein.
Surprisingly, several of the sensitive cell lines
(AsPC-1, RXF393 and A2780) did not decrease cyclin E
upon incubation with MK-8776, although it was decreased
by AZD1775 (Figure 4A). Degradation of cyclin E is
not solely regulated by CDK2 but by a phosphodegron
whereby CDK2 phosphorylates ser399 and GSK3B then
phosphorylates thr395 [25]. Consequently, the degradation

of cyclin E in U2OS cells was prevented by incubation
with the GSK3B inhibitor CHIR-99021 (Figure 4D).
We therefore questioned whether the failure to degrade
cyclin E in AsPC1 and A2780 cells was due to a lack of
active GSK3B. The cells were incubated with LY294002
to inhibit PI3K, which in turn leads to activation of
GSK3B (confirmed by the decreased phosphorylation of
ser9), and as a consequence, cyclin E was now degraded
(Figure 4D). This degradation was also prevented by
concurrent inhibition of GSK3B by CHIR-99021. These
results suggest that the failure to degrade cyclin E is not a
deficiency in activation of CDK2 but rather in the limited
availability of active GSK3B.
To further dissect the regulation of cyclin E/CDK2
in the U2OS and AsPC-1 cells, we immunoprecipitated
cyclin E and assessed the amount of CDK that coimmunoprecipitated. In both cell lines, a very low level of
CDK2 was associated with cyclin E either constitutively
or after incubation with MK-8776; no CDK1 was detected
(Figure 5A). We also assessed the amount of CDK2 that
co-immunoprecipated with cyclin A; more CDK2 was
detected but most still appeared to be unbound (Figure
5B). These results suggest that the majority of CDK2
is not associated with either cyclin A or E and therefore
inactive. These observations are attributed to the fact
that, unlike CDK1/cyclin B, CDK2 is phosphorylated on
tyrosine 15 independent of cyclin E or cyclin A, and only
a small amount then complexes with the cyclins [26]. To
confirm this hypothesis, we immunoprecipitated CDK2

to assess its phosphorylation status and indeed found that
most of the CDK2 remained phosphorylated even when
cells were incubated with MK-8776 (Supplemental Figure
S3). In contrast, inhibition of Wee1 prevented the initial
phosphorylation of CDK2 so no phosphorylation was
detected. These observations also provide an additional
explanation as to why little if any dephosphorylation of
CDK2 was observed upon incubation of cells with MK8776; as the majority of phospho-CDK2 is not bound to
cyclin E or A, it is not subject to dephosphorylation by
CDC25A.

Resistance to MK-8776 is associated with failure
to activate CDK2
The experiments above suggested that CDK2
activity is required for sensitivity of cells to both MK8776 and AZD1775. We therefore selected several of the
cell lines that were resistant to MK-8776 (Figure 1). These
cells failed to dephosphorylate CDK1/2, did not degrade
cyclin E, and did not accumulate γH2AX (Figure 4A). The
failure to degrade cyclin E might be attributable to limited
GSK3B activity as seen for AsPC1 cells. Incubation with
LY294002 activated GSK3B as judged by decreased
phosphorylation of ser9-GSK3, but unlike AsPC-1 cells,
this failed to induce degradation of cyclin E, consistent
with the failure of MK-8776 to activate CDK2 (Figure
4D).
ADR-Res cells were resistant to both MK-8776 and

AZD1775, and this correlated with a failure to activate
CDK2 as assessed by degradation of cyclin E (Figure
4A). AZD1775 also failed to induce dephosphorylation of
CDK1/2 (Figures 4A and 6A). One possible mechanism
of resistance to AZD1775 is that they rely on Myt1 to
prevent activation of CDK1/2. We are unaware of any
selective inhibitors of Myt1, but PD166285 is a broad
tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits both Wee1 and Myt1
[17]. All the cell lines were sensitive to a 24-h incubation
with PD166285 (Figure 1C), and γH2AX was observed
preferentially in S phase cells with potency similar to
both MK-8776 and AZD1775 (Supplemental Figure
S2C). ADR-Res cells incubated with PD166285 exhibited
dephosphorylation of CDK1/2, and phosphorylation of
RPA, H2AX and HH3 within 6 h (Figure 6). This acute
sensitivity of ADR-Res cells suggests that resistance to
AZD1775 might be mediated by Myt1.

siRNA targeting either cyclin E or cyclin A. In both AsPC1 and ACHN cells, the suppression of cyclin A, but not
cyclin E, resulted in suppression of γH2AX (Figure 5C).
As CDK1 did not immunoprecipitate with cyclin A (Figure
5B), these results support the contention that cyclin A/
CDK2 activation is critical for the onset of DSB.

MK-8776-mediated accumulation of CDC25A
predicts sensitivity to MK-8776
The activation of CDK2 is a consequence of its
dephosphorylation by CDC25A which, in turn, is a
direct target of Chk1. Phosphorylation by Chk1 causes
degradation of CDC25A and maintains low basal levels of
CDC25A [27]. Therefore, we assessed the impact of MK8776 on the levels of CDC25A. In six sensitive cell lines,
MK-8776 induced accumulation of CDC25A, consistent
with the observed activation of CDK2 (Figure 7A). In
contrast, five resistant cell lines exhibited no change in
CDC25A levels consistent with the failure of MK-8776
to activate CDK2. There was a large range of levels of
CDC25A across the cell lines requiring multiple exposures
of the western blots to show the differences; one cell line,
ADR-Res, expressed no detectable protein (note the AsPC1 lysate is shown in both blots for direct comparison of
levels). Interestingly, there is no correlation between basal
CDC25A levels and sensitivity to MK-8776.

Cyclin A/CDK2 is responsible for the appearance
of γH2AX
CDK2 normally partners with both cyclin E and
cyclin A. The results above have correlated the activation
of cyclin E/CDK2 with sensitivity to MK-8776 and
AZD1775. However, the DSB could equally be the
consequence of activation of cyclin A/CDK2, and CDK2
did immunoprecipitate with both cyclins (Figure 5A and
5B). To address this possibility, we transfected cells with

Figure 6: Mechanism of resistance of ADR-Res cells to MK-8776. ADR-Res cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations
of either MK-8776, AZD1775 or PD166285 for 6 h, then analyzed by western blotting. These cells were only sensitive to PD166285 and

DISCUSSION

the short incubation with drug might better reflect what
can be achieved upon administration to a patient. It also
demonstrates a potential therapeutic window that is based
on both dose and time of administration. For example,
a non-transformed, but immortalized breast cell line
(IMEC) was completely resistant to a 48-h incubation
and only showed a slight growth inhibition after 7 days.
MK-8776 continued to inhibit Chk1 in resistant cells for
7 days without impeding their growth. This differs from
experiments in mice in which deletion of Chk1 led to

By screening a large number of cell lines, we have
established that only about 15% are hypersensitive to the
Chk1 inhibitor MK-8776 following a 24-h incubation
(IC50 < 2 µM). Our cytotoxicity assay differs from more
commonly used continuous incubations of cells with
drug as it assesses the ability of cells to recover over 6
days following a short incubation. In this regard, it more
closely approximates a clonogenic assay. Furthermore,

Figure 7: Impact of MK-8776 on CDC25A levels in sensitive and resistant cells. A. Sensitive (top) and resistant cells (bottom)
were incubated with MK-8776 for 6 h, then analyzed by western blotting for changes in level of CDC25A protein. AsPC-1 cells are
included in both panels for comparison. Several exposures are shown of each blot. Each lane contained lysate from 20,000 cells. PARP was
used as a loading control; while it differs in level between cell lines, it demonstrates equal loading between control and treated samples for
each line. B. Model of the signaling pathway impacted by Chk1 in MK-8776-sensitive and resistant cells. A role for any of the alternate
kinases (GSK3, PLK3, CK1/ε and NEK11) in eliciting resistance remains to be established. The box demonstrates how the Wee1 inhibitor

embryonic lethality [28, 29]. Previous experiments have
been performed with U2OS cells that are sensitive to Chk1
inhibition [30], but those studies failed to recognize that
the majority of cell lines can tolerate inhibition of Chk1
for long periods.
Sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition was observed as
rapid induction ( < 6 h) of γH2AX in S phase cells. As
more cells progress from G1 into S, they also succumb
to Chk1 inhibition and exhibit high γH2AX. Prior
experiments have demonstrated that the γH2AX in U2OS
cells correlates with the appearance of DSB [11], and
this was confirmed for AsPC-1 cells in this study. These
DSB were prevented by CVT-313 at concentrations
that selectively inhibit CDK2, and by siRNA-mediated
suppression of cyclin A. CDK2 is required for replication
origin firing and is therefore suppressed by Chk1 [31].
Chk1 inhibition in early S phase leads to premature firing
of late replication origins, which may result in collision
of these late replicons with ongoing transcription, R loop
formation and replication fork collapse [32]. Whether this
pathway is involved in the observed cytotoxicity remains
to be determined, but downstream effectors, Mre11 and
Mus81 nucleases, have been implicated in the eventual
DNA breakage [11, 33, 34].
It was unexpected to find that cells do not tolerate
increased CDK2 activity in S phase, although, in
retrospect, this has been reported previously using a CDK2
variant that can not be phosphorylated on thr14 and tyr15
[35]. In contrast, CDK2 is usually considered essential for
progression through S phase, as it is required for loading
Cdc45 on to DNA to initiate the firing of each replication
fork [31]. However, we observed that incubation of
undamaged cells with CVT-313 failed to arrest cells in
S phase suggesting that this requirement for CDK2 can
be circumvented. Incubation of undamaged cells with
CVT-313 did cause accumulation of cyclin E suggesting
that there is sufficient constitutive CDK2 activity to limit
cyclin E/CDK2. It is possible that there is a threshold level
of activity of CDK2 below which cells survive, but which,
once exceeded, leads to DSB. Cells may activate CDK2
in S phase as a stress response that permits circumvention
of blocked replication by activating alternate replicons.
Hence, there must be a careful balance between the CDK2
activity required for replication recovery versus induction
of extensive DNA fragmentation.
The majority of cell lines were resistant to Chk1
inhibition. Resistance did not correlate with any particular
organ site or p53 status. While the observed DSB might
induce a p53 response, that would occur after activation
of CDK2 so could not prevent the damage. Several cell
lines had been selected for other phenotypes that might
contribute to sensitivity (e.g., 2008, a FANCF-defective
ovarian line; ATLD1, isolated from a patient defective for
Mre11), but they, and their complemented derivatives,
remained resistant to MK-8776 in our analysis (Figure 1).
To begin to understand the mechanism of resistance
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to MK-8776, we asked whether more direct activation
of CDK2 using the Wee1 inhibitor AZD1775 would
circumvent resistance. Inhibition of Wee1 was cytotoxic
to most of the cell lines, and the few resistant lines were
sensitive to dual inhibition of Wee1 and Myt1. MK8776-resistant cells failed to activate CDK2 or degrade
cyclin E (a consequence of CDK2 activation) in response
to Chk1 inhibition. This compared to the sensitive
cells that activated CDK2 and, in most cases, degraded
cyclin E. Several sensitive cells failed to degrade cyclin
E, but this was attributed to limited activity of GSK3B,
whose activity is also required to phosphorylate the
phosphodegron in cyclin E that leads to its degradation. In
contrast, activation of GSK3B in resistant cells, in concert
with MK-8776, did not lead to degradation of cyclin E.
These results suggest that the mechanism of resistance
to MK-8776 is mediated upstream of CDK2 activation
(Figure 7B). In support of this conclusion, MK-8776
induced accumulation of CDC25A only in the sensitive
cells. CDC25A regulation is complex with input from
multiple other kinases resulting in either degradation
or sequestration depending on cell cycle phase [36-39].
Future studies will be directed to defining the critical
proteins that regulate CDC25A and discriminate sensitive
and resistant cells.
It has previously been demonstrated that the Wee1
inhibitor can force S phase-arrested cells to directly enter
mitosis without completing DNA synthesis, albeit only in
some cell lines [5, 14]. It was suggested this was a novel
mechanism of action whereby unscheduled entry into
mitosis explained the underlying sensitivity to AZD1775.
However, we demonstrate that extensive γH2AX can
occur in S phase upon incubation with either MK-8776 or
AZD1775, and these cells are distinct from those positive
for pHH3, demonstrating that mitotic events are not
required for the DSB observed here.
These experiments required a critical reevaluation
of the tools available to discriminate CDK1 from CDK2.
Many suppliers provide antibodies that are purported to
detect phosphotyrosine on CDK1, while other antibodies
are purported to detect the phosphotyrosine on CDK2.
However, this is a highly conserved epitope in both
proteins and the antibodies do not discriminate the two
kinases. The use of siRNA to suppress one or other
kinase can also be misleading as this can arrest cell cycle
progression in G1 or G2 and thereby protect cells from
a drug that requires S phase progression. We found that
the commonly used CDK1-selective inhibitor Ro3306 was
equally effective at inhibiting CDK2. This observation
may relate to the much lower level of CDK2 present
in cells compared to CDK1, and also to the very small
proportion of CDK2 that complexes with either cyclin E
or cyclin A [21, 26]. We conclude that CVT-313 is more
selective for CDK2 and this was a major tool to help
understand the critical role of CDK2. Many substrates
can be phosphorylated by both CDK1 and CDK2, but
1390

cyclin E should be a selective target for CDK2 as they
form a heterodimeric complex. The fact that cyclin E was
degraded whenever CDK2 was active was also a useful
tool in these studies, but with the proviso that concurrent
GSK3B-mediated phosphorylation is also required for
cyclin E degradation. An interesting extrapolation of these
observations is that cells or tumors with elevated cyclin E
protein probably reflect cells with inactive CDK2.
Several Chk1 inhibitors have been combined with
DNA damaging agents in clinical trials, though several
were terminated because of toxicity [2, 40]. Many of
the drugs are not pure Chk1 inhibitors, so it is not clear
whether the toxicity is due to off-target effects. For
example, a recent report showed that three Chk1 inhibitors
also inhibit FLT3 [41]. MK-8776 is possibly one of the
most selective inhibitors, and clinical trials have been
performed in combination with both cytarabine and
gemcitabine; partial responses were observed but further
development has been terminated for business reasons
[15, 42, 43]. A Phase I clinical trial of GDC0425 plus
gemcitabine continues (www.clinicaltrials.gov) though the
selectivity of this compound has not yet been reported. The
only clinical trial testing a Chk1 inhibitor as monotherapy
involves LY2606368, although this compound also
inhibits a variety of other kinases including Chk2 and
RSK1-3. Unfortunately no attempt has been made to
stratify patients who might respond. This is critical if
Chk1 inhibitors are to succeed as monotherapy.
In summary, we conclude that CDK2 is usually
repressed in S phase cells, and its untimely activation
explains the sensitivity to Chk1 and Wee1 inhibitors as
single agents. The mechanism of resistance to MK-8776
appears to rely on redundant pathways that regulate
CDC25A, whereas the sensitive cells appear to rely
solely on Chk1. Identification of the critical determinants
of response is required so that appropriate patients
can be stratified to clinical trials of Chk1 inhibitors as
monotherapy.
