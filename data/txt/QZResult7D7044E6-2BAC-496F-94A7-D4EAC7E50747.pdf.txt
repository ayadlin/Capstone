ABSTRACT
Our identification of dysregulation of the AKT pathway in ovarian cancer as a
platinum resistance specific event led to a comprehensive analysis of in vitro, in
vivo and clinical behaviour of the AKT inhibitor GSK2141795. Proteomic biomarker
signatures correlating with effects of GSK2141795 were developed using in vitro
and in vivo models, well characterised for related molecular, phenotypic and imaging
endpoints. Signatures were validated in temporally paired biopsies from patients
treated with GSK2141795 in a clinical study. GSK2141795 caused growth-arrest
as single agent in vitro, enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis in vitro and reduced
tumour volume in combination with platinum in vivo. GSK2141795 treatment in vitro
and in vivo resulted in ~50-90% decrease in phospho-PRAS40 and 20-80% decrease
in fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG) uptake. Proteomic analysis of GSK2141795 in vitro and
in vivo identified a signature of pathway inhibition including changes in AKT and p38
phosphorylation and total Bim, IGF1R, AR and YB1 levels. In patient biopsies, prior to
treatment with GSK2141795 in a phase 1 clinical trial, this signature was predictive of
post-treatment changes in the response marker CA125. Development of this signature
represents an opportunity to demonstrate the clinical importance of AKT inhibition
for re-sensitisation of platinum resistant ovarian cancer to platinum.

INTRODUCTION

is explained by the frequent emergence of resistance
to current therapeutic regimens combining platinum
compounds and taxanes [1]. Addition of further cytotoxic
combinations have not produced clinical improvement
[2], and thus the focus has turned to targeted therapeutics,

selected on the basis of our understanding of ovarian
tumour biology.
EOC is a heterogeneous group of diseases
representing distinct histological subtypes including
serous, endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous. Serous
ovarian cancer has been further divided into Type I and
Type II tumours which represent distinct clinical and
genetic entities [3]. One of the most frequently activated
pathways in EOC is the PI3K/AKT oncogenic network.
PI3K (~40%), KRAS (~20%) and PTEN (~5%) mutations
underlie activation in Type I tumours, whereas Type II
tumours exhibit frequent copy number changes and overexpression of PI3K/AKT pathway components (~46%)
[4]. We showed that activation of AKT in platinumresistant cells occurs by phosphorylation of AKT at
serine 473 by DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNAPK) [5] following DNA damage, directly linking the
established role of AKT in chemo-resistance to platinummediated DNA damage [4, 6, 7]. We also demonstrated
that inhibition of AKT or DNA-PK restores sensitivity
to platinum in clinically resistant EOC cells [5]. These
data suggest AKT is a strong anti-cancer target for
platinum resistant disease and several AKT inhibitors
have been developed and are reviewed elsewhere [6, 7].
GlaxoSmithKline has developed GSK2141795, which is
a potent N-alkyl pyrazole pan-AKT inhibitor, with high
affinity for all three AKT isoforms [8, 9].
The development of drugs for treatment of cancer
remains a slow, expensive and high-risk process with
many compounds failing due to lack of therapeutic
activity, toxicity and poor pharmacokinetics. Additionally,
the difficulty in translating behaviour of anti-cancer agents
from in vitro to in vivo, and subsequently the clinical
environment has contributed to this failure. A key area of
focus in the drug discovery process is identification and
validation of reliable predictive and pharmacodynamic
(PD) biomarkers. PD biomarkers may include cellular,
molecular, histopathological and/or imaging parameters
[10, 11]. Such PD biomarkers should clearly enable
efficient and scientifically-driven “Go/NoGo” decisions
allowing acceleration of the drug development process.
This study was designed to evaluate the activity
of the specific AKT inhibitor GSK2141795 [9] alone
and in combination with platinum in platinum-resistant
ovarian cancer and to guide the clinical development of
AKT inhibition by identifying protein-based and imagingbased predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers.
Significantly, we report the identification of a proteomic
signature of response to AKT inhibition using in vitro
and in vivo samples and subsequent validation using
clinical biopsies taken before and after treatment with
GSK2141795. This signature will be of use for predicting
response to AKT inhibition in the clinic.

Inhibition of AKT results in growth arrest alone
and apoptosis in combination with cisplatin in
platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cells
Platinum-resistant SKOV3 cells, grown as
monolayers, were treated with GSK2141795 alone or
with cisplatin for 24, 48 and 72 hours. Caspase 3/7 activity
was assessed as a marker of apoptosis at each time point.
GSK2141795 treatment alone did not induce caspase
activation, however significantly enhanced apoptosis
induced by cisplatin at all time points tested (Figure
1A and Supplementary Figure S1). Similar results were
obtained for platinum-resistant PEO4 ovarian cancer cell
monolayers (Figure 1B) and SKOV3 spheroids (Figure
1C).
Cell viability in 2D-monolayers was measured
by MTT assay, which measures cellular metabolism
as a surrogate of viability, under conditions identical to
apoptosis experiments. SKOV3 cells treated GSK2141795
showed a dose dependent decrease in cell viability
(Figure 2A). Interestingly, this was despite no increase
in apoptosis detected by caspase 3/7 assay (Figure 1A),
and is thus consistent with MTT changes predominantly
representing growth arrest rather than apoptosis.
Treatment with cisplatin alone reduced cell viability,
and this was further decreased in a GSK2141795 dosedependent manner on combination (Figure 2A: >50%
reduction with cisplatin and 5µM GSK2141795 relative
to cisplatin-treatment alone (p < 0.01)), and the halfmaximal effective concentration of GSK2141795 in the
combination treatment was 3μM. Cell cycle analysis by
flow cytometry indicated G1 and G2 arrest in SKOV3
cells treated with GSK2141795 alone, but no increase in
apoptosis, consistent with caspase 3/7 and MTT assay data
(Figure 2B). Co-treatment with GSK2141795 and cisplatin
increased sub-G0/G1 fraction compared to either drug
treatment alone, consistent with caspase activation data
(Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure S2).
The combinatorial effect of varying concentrations
of cisplatin and GSK2141795 in vitro was assessed by
isobologram analysis and indicated synergy in both
SKOV3 and PEO4 cells (Supplementary Figure S3).
Tumour growth rates of SKOV3 tumour-bearing
mice were assessed following daily dosing with vehicle
or GSK2141795 either alone or in combination with
cisplatin. Treatment with cisplatin alone caused a
significant decrease in tumour size compared to vehicletreated animals at day 14 (p < 0.05; Figure 2C). When
GSK2141795 and cisplatin were used in combination, the
tumour growth rates were further decreased compared to
cisplatin only treated animals (p < 0.01; Figure 2C).

blood taken from in vivo SKOV3 xenograft time-course
studies were determined. GSK2141795 accumulated in
the SKOV3 xenograft tumours during the first 24 hours
of treatment, with 12.5 hour half-life of the drug in the
tumour (Supplementary Figure S4). In comparison,
GSK2141795 was elevated in the blood for 60 minutes
following oral dosing, decreasing rapidly to low levels for
the remainder of the time-course (Supplementary Figure
S4).

To confirm the ability of GSK2141795 to
inhibit AKT signalling in SKOV3 cells, lysates from
2D monolayers and 3D spheroids were treated with
GSK2141795 and analysed for phosphorylation of
its downstream substrate PRAS40. Treatment with
GSK2141795 resulted in a concentration-dependent
reduction in the ratio of phosphorylated PRAS40 (Thr246)

concentrations of GSK2141795, 1 hour prior to treatment with cisplatin (cddp; 25 μM). Induction of caspase 3/7 activity was assessed at 24

to total PRAS40 in both SKOV3 monolayers and 3D
spheroids (Figure 3A). Phosphorylation of PRAS40 at
Thr246 was reduced to < 1% pretreatment level in SKOV3
monolayers treated with GSK2141795 (5µM) for both 72
hours (Figure 3A) and 48 hours (Supplementary Figure
S5). Reduction in phosphorylation was only partial (~50%
of the pretreatment level) in the 3D model at the highest
concentration, perhaps reflecting partial penetration

of the compound into the 3D spheroids (Figure 3A).
Additionally, levels of phosphorylated PRAS40 were
significantly reduced in SKOV3 xenografts following
treatment with either GSK2141795 as a single agent (p
< 0.01) or in combination with cisplatin (p < 0.05; Figure
3B). This effect was not observed when using cisplatin as
a single agent in these xenografts.

FDG uptake in 2D, 3D spheroids and tumour
xenograft models of ovarian cancer

24-hour time-course. [3H]FDG uptake into vehicle
treated monolayers and spheroids reached a plateau at
approximately 6 and 10 hours, respectively (t½ = 0.52
hours (monolayers) and 3.04 hours (spheroids); Figures
4A and 4B). Additionally, these in vitro time-course
studies demonstrated dose-dependent decrease in FDG
uptake upon treatment with GSK2141795 (t½ = 0.41 and
0.53 hours for 1 and 5 µM, respectively (monolayers);
and 5.79 and 4.30 hours for 1 and 5 µM, respectively
(spheroids)) (Figures 4A and 4B). In addition, SKOV3
tumour bearing mice were treated with GSK2141795
for 1 to 72 hours prior to [18F]FDG administration.
Uptake of [18F]FDG into SKOV3 tumours decreased in
a time-dependent manner (t½ = 12 hours) following oral
administration of GSK2141795 (30mg/kg; Supplementary
Figure S4A); which results in blood and tumour Cmax
>5µM GSK2141795 (Supplementary Figure S4B-D).
Although maximal uptake of [3H]FDG into SKOV3
monolayers and spheroids occurred at approximately 6
and 10 hours respectively, it is not feasible to use these
time points when scanning patients with [18F]FDG in
the clinic. Therefore, dose-response studies utilising
GSK2141795 were repeated in SKOV3 monolayers at 2
hours (optimum time for clinical scanning; Figure 4C) and
spheroids at both 2 and 6 hours (6 hours = optimum time
for incubation of the tumours with radio-ligand; Figure
4C) to allow comparison. A dose-dependent decrease in
[3H]FDG uptake was observed in the SKOV3 monolayers
(ED50 = 0.22 µM; Figure 4C) which formed a plateau at
~1 µM GSK2141795. A greater concentration-dependent
effect of GSK2141795 was observed in the SKOV3
spheroids at both the 2 and 6 hour time-points, again
reaching a plateau at ~1 μM, yielding similar ED50 values
(ED50 = 0.42 µM (2 hours) and 0.18 µM (6 hours); Figure
4C). In vivo analysis of the effect of GSK2141795 on [18F]
FDG uptake into SKOV3 xenografts indicated reduced
[18F]FDG signal compared to vehicle reaching a maximum
of 68% at the highest dose of 30 mg/kg of GSK2141795 (p
< 0.05) used in this study (Figure 4D).
The relationship between decreases in FDG uptake
in cells and changes in downstream markers of AKT
pathway inhibition (phospho-PRAS40/total PRAS40)
induced by GSK2141795 were evaluated in SKOV3
monolayers and spheroids. These comparisons revealed
a strong positive correlation between the two parameters
over the range of GSK2141795 concentrations in both the
SKOV3 monolayers (R2 = 0.910; Figure 4E) and spheroids
(R2 = 0.979; Figure 4F).

Uptake of radiolabelled FDG into SKOV3
monolayers and spheroids, treated with GSK2141795
for 24 and 48 hours respectively, was measured over a

number of patients with paired biopsies (n = 10). A
similar effect, although not statistically significant, is also
observed in which response tends to be better in patients
with high pre-treatment levels of the GSK2141795downregulated proteins (Figure 5D (right panel)). These
results suggest that it is possible to predict the clinical
benefit a patient may gain from treatment with AKT
inhibitors, based on the proteomic signatures derived
from our experiments involving in vitro and in vivo model
systems.

DISCUSSION

Using the experimentally-derived proteomic
signature of AKT inhibition via treatment with
GSK2141795 (Table 1), we calculated signature scores
to reflect the degree of AKT pathway modulation in
this series of biopsies taken from patients undergoing
treatment with GSK2141795 in the clinic. Clinical
response in patients receiving the drug was inferred from
the percentage drop in levels of the ovarian cancer marker
CA125. Interestingly, the difference in signature scores
between pre-treatment and post-treatment biopsies for
each patient were correlated to the corresponding decrease
in CA125 levels, as shown in Figure 5C. It can be seen
that as expression levels of the in vitro GSK2141795upregulated proteins (see Table 1) systematically increase
following clinical administration of the drug, there is a
trend towards the patient’s CA125 levels decreasing
correspondingly (p = 0.082). A similar effect is observed
for a decrease in expression of the in vitro GSK2141795downregulated proteins (p = ns). This indicates that
successful pharmacological modulation of the AKT
pathway in ovarian tumours is reflected by a decrease in
the patient’s overall tumour burden.

The AKT pathway has been shown to have a role
in chemotherapy resistance in a variety of situations
[12]. This study describes the first demonstration of
the ability of the ATP competitive, pan-AKT inhibitor,
GSK2141795 [9], to restore platinum-sensitivity to cells
that developed platinum resistance in patients. In addition,
we have demonstrated the utility of FDG-PET imaging
as a pharmacodynamic marker via correlating changes
in glucose metabolism (as measured by changes in FDG
uptake) with changes in downstream biomarkers (phosphoPRAS40) of AKT inhibition and have importantly shown
that proteomic signatures derived from our in vitro and in
vivo experiments are predictive of patient PD and CA125
response to GSK2141795 in the clinic.
GSK2141795 as a single agent did not increase
levels of caspase 3/7 activity in platinum-resistant cell
lines, despite inhibiting AKT enzymatic activity, as
inferred by decrease in phosphorylation of PRAS40.
The drug did however cause growth arrest as a single
agent, as indicated by cell cycle analysis and MTT assay.
This observation indicates that increases in caspase 3/7
activity, indicative of increased apoptosis, observed when
GSK2141795 was combined with cisplatin were due to
synergy between the two agents, a finding which was
confirmed by subsequent isobologram analysis. This
has important implications for the use of AKT inhibitors
suggesting that synergistic combinations with drugs
that enhance apoptosis would be predicted to be more
clinically efficacious than single agent treatment, which
may only cause temporary tumour growth arrest.
Given these data and the clinical unmet need of
ovarian cancer patients with platinum-resistant disease,
combining GSK2141795 with platinum-based agents in
the clinic is imperative. However, combining anti-cancer
agents in the clinic is not always straightforward; doses
of drugs used in combination often have to be reduced
compared to when they are given as monotherapies. Yet
it is not always clear that the reduced dose will have
the same effects on the target pathway, i.e. what is the
minimal level of pathway inhibition required to maintain
efficacy. Ideally, quantification of pathway inhibition
would be done with serial biopsies of a patient’s tumour

Pre-treatment expression levels of AKT-inhibition
signature proteins are predictive of clinical
response
The clinical activity in patients receiving
GSK2141795, as indicated by the percentage decrease in
CA125 levels, was significantly greater in patients with
low pre-treatment levels of the in vitro GSK2141795upregulated proteins (see Table 1) than it was for the
patients with high pre-treatment levels of these proteins.
Figure 5D (left panel) shows the distributions of CA125
decrease for the low-expressing group (consisting
of patients for which z-scores for the GSK2141795upregulated signature were less than zero in pre-treatment
biopsies, meaning the tumours were expressing the
proteins at relatively low levels), and the high-expressing
group (the remaining patients, which all had z-scores
greater than zero). The correlation between low pretreatment expression of the GSK2141795-upregulated
proteins and the treatment-induced reduction in CA125

before and after drug treatment, in order to evaluate levels
of phosphorylated AKT substrates. Although paired
biopsies were achieved in the trial described here, clinical
implementation of this approach can be challenging due
to the lack of infrastructure at most centres for collection
and processing of biopsies, the invasive nature of repeat
biopsies or lack of biopsiable tumours in some patients.
Therefore having a way to measure pathway inhibition in
a non-invasive fashion would be of great benefit to this
process.
The preclinical FDG-PET studies described in
this manuscript suggest that FDG-PET may be a useful
pharmacodynamic biomarker for reflecting the effects
of GSK2141795 on tumour glucose metabolism in the
clinic. Identical FDG-PET studies were performed using
SKOV3 cells as (1) monolayers, (2) spheroids and (3) in
vivo xenografts. This allowed for comparison of the data
obtained with the three models in order to determine the
inter-predictability of each model and the relationship
between changes in phospho-PRAS40 and FDG uptake
in various models. Our data shows that although phosphoPRAS40 levels were decreased by >50% in all 3 model
systems, only spheroids and in vivo xenografts showed
>50% decrease in FDG uptake, suggesting that spheroids
may be preferable to monolayer cultures as an in vitro
representation of in vivo physiology. Spheroids studies
also demonstrated a concentration-dependent decrease
in FDG signal following GSK2141795 administration,
which was reproduced in xenograft studies. These data,
coupled with the PK data obtained from xenograft studies,
predict that concentrations ≥1 μM GSK2141795 would be
required achieve maximal decrease in phospho-PRAS40
and FDG uptake.
In a phase I dose escalation study of GSK2141795
in cancer patients, a mean Cmax of 398 ng/mL (0.93 μM)
was observed at the maximally tolerated dose of 75 mg
GSK2141795 once daily [13]. Separately, we reported, in
a PK/PD phase I study, an inverse relationship between
maximum GSK2141795 plasma concentrations with
the maximum decrease in [18F]FDG uptake in patient
tumours [8], i.e. as concentrations of GSK2141795
increased, FDG-uptake decreased. The lack of a clear dose
response relationship in the latter study was likely due to
a narrow dose range tested (25-75 mg, daily) coupled with
large inter-patient variability in the pharmacokinetics
of GSK2141795. Maximum GSK2141795 plasma
concentrations observed in the clinical study ranged from
approximately 300-800 ng/mL (0.70-1.86 μM), with
>40% decrease in [18F]FDG uptake in 5 out of 6 patients
achieving >1 μM Cmax on week 4 [8]. The preclinical
data reported in this manuscript are in agreement with
the clinical observations that AKT inhibition with
GSK2141795 requires ≥1 μM concentration for optimal
decreases in [18F]FDG uptake.
Protein level analysis of tumour xenografts and
cell monolayers following treatment with GSK2141795
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

revealed several consistent alterations within the AKT
pathway. Of particular note AKT phosphorylation at S473
and T308 were increased following dosing of tumour
xenografts in vivo and in two different cell line models
in vitro indicating these may represent stable molecular
biomarkers of AKT inhibition by a catalytic domain
inhibitor. Although counter-intuitive at face value the
increase in AKT phosphorylation following treatment
with an AKT kinase domain inhibitor has been reported
previously [14-18]. Two main hypotheses prevail to
explain this. Firstly inhibition of mTOR signalling
downstream of AKT may alleviate a negative feedback
loop exerted through p70-S6K/IRS-1 mediated inhibition
of PI3K [15, 17]. Secondly, the occupancy of the ATP
binding domain of AKT by an ATP competitive inhibitor
stabilises the structure of AKT such that access to negative
regulatory phosphatases is restricted [14, 16]. Experiments
using catalytically inactive mutants of AKT indicated that
downstream activity is not required for inhibitor-induced
hyper-phosphorylation, hence favouring the second
hypothesis [18]. In addition to AKT hyper-phosphorylation
upon treatment with GSK2141795 we also saw increased
phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and increases in total
AR, Bim, IGF1R and YB-1 consistently across the
independent RPPA datasets studied suggesting these as
relatively robust markers of AKT pathway inhibition. The
androgen receptor is phosphorylated at serine 210 by AKT,
which has been reported to supress AR transactivation
and transcription of AR target genes including p21 and
AR itself [19]. Pro-apoptotic Bim is transcriptionally
regulated by forkhead family of transcription factors,
which in turn are negatively regulated by AKT-dependent
phosphorylation hence Bim upregulation on AKT
inhibition is indicative of on target effects of GSK2141795
and also a functional indicator of apoptotic priming [20].
Interestingly however, despite upregulation of Bim
and phosphorylation of p38-MAPK following AKT
inhibition, data in Figures 1 and S1 indicate that caspase
activation and hence apoptosis does not occur on single
agent AKT inhibition. We hypothesise that p38-MAPK
phosphorylation and Bim upregulation primes the cells for
apoptosis, which then occurs only following an apoptotic
stimulus such as platinum treatment (Figure 1). YB-1 is an
oncogenic transcription and translation factor, regulated by
direct phosphorylation by AKT. At high levels it blocks
protein translation and inhibits proliferation whereas
AKT phosphorylation has been proposed to disable this
inhibitory activity allowing translation of oncogenic
proteins [21-23]. Yan et al reported AKT pathway analysis
in preclinical (breast cancer) and clinical samples (phase
1; solid tumours) treated with the ATP-competitive AKT
inhibitor GDC-0068. Consistent with our data they
observed increases in pAKT and decreases in pPRAS40
and pS6 on AKT inhibitor treatment [24]. They also
reported a compensatory feedback activation of ERK and
HER3, which was not observed here, possible reflecting

the different biology of the cancer types studied.
Importantly we showed that the significant changes
upon GSK2141795 treatment in vitro and in vivo were
also seen in paired clinical biopsies taken before and
four weeks after GSK2141795 treatment on clinical trial
and that the detection of these alterations was correlated
with the extent decrease in CA125 in this small patient
cohort, as a surrogate of clinical anti-tumour activity.
Perhaps more importantly we also showed that the pretreatment levels of “upregulated signature” proteins
were significantly predictive of CA125 response to
GSK2141795. Surprisingly we found that low levels of
pAKT in pre-treatment biopsies was part of the predictive
signature of response. This indicates that pAKT levels
must be below a certain threshold for treatment to be
effective ie that AKT inhibitor treatment is not 100%
efficient and in patients with robust baseline activity,
sufficient pathway down-regulation to produce 30%
CA125 decrease may not be achieved. Pathway signatures
identified here warrant confirmation in larger future
clinical studies and to consider their utility in predicting
response in combination with platinum containing
chemotherapy.
To conclude, data reported in this manuscript
demonstrate that the pan-AKT inhibitor, GSK2141795,
modulates multiple components of AKT signalling in
platinum-resistant ovarian cancer cells, most notably
components of the mTOR pathway, that [18F]FDG uptake
could be used as a non-invasive pharmacodynamic marker
and that levels of AKT pathway proteins identified in preclinical models, are able to predict CA125 response in
platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients treated with
the AKT inhibitor GSK2141795. This data suggests that
proteomic signature can be used to stratify patient selection
and that [18F]FDG can be used to detect pharmacodynamic
tumour response to AKT inhibition. These data have
significant implication for clinical implementation of
targeted therapy using AKT inhibitor strategies.

(Edinburgh, UK). PEO4 cells have been shown previously
by us to activate AKT pathway in response to cisplatin
treatment and to be sensitized to platinum by AKT
inhibition [5]. The ovarian carcinoma cell line SKOV3
(cisplatin IC50 = 28.8µM), which harbours a PIK3CA
activating mutation (COSMIC ID: 1070900) and stably
expresses pAKT [5], was obtained from ECACC.

Flow cytometry analysis
Cells were treated with GSK2141795 (1μM or
5μM) and/or cisplatin (25μM). For combination treatment,
cells were pre-treated with GSK2141795 1 hour prior
to addition of cisplatin. Twenty-four hours following
incubation, cells were harvested with 0.25% trypsin.
Floating cells were combined with trypsinised cells prior to
centrifugation. Cells (100,000) were fixed in 70% ethanol
overnight at -20oC, followed by PBS wash and incubation
with 0.05mg/ml propidium iodide (PI), 0.2mg/ml RNase
A in PBS for 30 minutes, 4°C in the dark. Samples were
analysed with a FACScalibur flow cytometer (Becton
Dickinson, UK). Ten thousand threshold events per
sample were collected and analysed on the basis of their
FL2 fluorescence (excitation at 488nm/emission 585nm).
Data were analysed using Flowjo software (Tree Star. Inc.
USA).

Phospho-PRAS40 and PRAS40 enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays (ELISA)
Levels of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated
proline-rich AKT substrate of 40kDa (phospho-PRAS40
(pT246) and total PRAS40) were assessed using PRAS40
ELISA kits (Invitrogen, Camarillo, USA, KHO0421
and KHO0411 respectively). SKOV3 monolayers or
spheroids were treated with increasing concentrations
of GSK2141795 (0.01 - 5µM) for 48 hours. Following
treatment, cells were lysed in extraction buffer (Invitrogen,
Camarillo, USA, FNN0011) and samples diluted 1 in 50
in diluent buffer. On completion of the assay, absorbance
measured at 450nm. Phospho-PRAS40 levels were
normalised to the total PRAS40 concentration.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials

In vitro radioligand binding studies

The AKT inhibitor, GSK2141795 [9], was
synthesized at GlaxoSmithKline. Cisplatin was obtained
from Hammersmith Hospital’s pharmacy. [3H]FDG
(Specific Activity = 222 GBq/mmol; 37 MBq/ml) was
obtained from American Radiolabelled Chemicals Inc.,
St Louis, USA and [18F]FDG (500 MBq) was obtained
from PETNET UK. All other chemicals and reagents
were of the highest grade possible. The high-grade serous
ovarian cancer cell line PEO4 (cisplatin IC50 = 11.6µM
[25]), derived directly from patient ascites after platinumresistant relapse, was obtained from Dr. Simon Langdon
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

For time-course studies, SKOV3 monolayers
and spheroids were treated with two concentrations
of GSK2141795 (1 and 5µM) for 24 and 48 hours
respectively and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2. Shorter
exposure to GSK2141795 was considered for 2D-models
due to the greater growth inhibitory effect of GSK2141795
in monolayers. Twenty four hours into the incubation,
SKOV3 monolayers and spheroids were incubated with
medium (0.5 ml per well) containing [3H]FDG (296 kBq)
41746

for 0-24 hours as indicated. For dose-response studies,
SKOV3 monolayers and spheroids were treated with a
range of concentrations of GSK2141795 (0.001-5µM;
monolayers = 24hours; spheroids = 48hours). Monolayers
and spheroids were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2. Two
or six hours prior to the end of incubation, monolayers
and spheroids were incubated with 0.5ml medium per
well containing [3H]FDG (296kBq). Following assay,
monolayers and spheroids were washed twice with PBS
and solubilised in 0.1M NaOH at 37°C overnight prior
to transfer to 5ml tubes and addition of scintillation fluid
(4ml; Packard Ultima Gold MV). Bound radioactivity was
determined by liquid scintillation counting (Perkin Elmer,
TriCarb2900). For each spheroids, 100μl of final wash was
measured as background. Data were analysed by iterative
non-linear regression curve fitting procedures in Prism
v5.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, USA)
with each experiment analysed individually.

Reverse phase protein array (RPPA)
SKOV3 and PEO4 cells were treated with DMSO
(vehicle) or 5µM GSK2141795 in vitro at timepoints
indicated. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and
lysed using 100µL RPPA lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100,
50mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150mM NaCl, 1.5mM MgCl2,
1mM EGTA, 100mM NaF, 10mM Na pyrophosphate, 10%
glycerol containing freshly added protease (Roche Applied
Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (VWR)) on 6-well
plates. Tumours recovered from in vivo experiments were
crushed in 100µl cold RPPA lysis buffer using an electric
pellet pestle (Sigma). Lysates were centrifuged at 14000
rpm at 4ºC for 15 minutes following incubation on ice
for 30 minutes. Supernatants were collected and pellets
discarded. Protein concentration was determined by BCA
assay. Additional lysates were derived from 18 gauge core
biopsies taken at screening and at week 4 from 12 patients
on phase 1b trial of single agent GSK2141795 (trial
number NCT01266954; ClinicalTrials.gov) [8]. Details
are in Supplementary Table 1. Lysates were shipped to
MD Anderson Cancer Centre and analysed by RPPA as
described previously [26]. RPPA data was normalised
as described [27] and analysed using Genespring GX7
(Agilent) and R with Bioconductor. Full RPPA datasets
are available as Supplementary Tables S3 (in vitro/in vivo)
and S4 (clinical).

In vivo xenograft imaging studies
All animal work described was performed in
accordance with the United Kingdom’s ‘Guidance on
the Operation of Animals’ (Scientific Procedures) Act
1986. Mice (female, Crl: NU/NU-Foxn-1, 25 - 30 g)
were supplied by Charles River, UK. Subcutaneous
xenografts were generated via injection of ~10million
SKOV3 cells into the flank of NU/NU-Foxn-1 mice and
tumours grown to approximately 100mm3. For tumour
growth studies, mice bearing SKOV3 xenografts were
randomly grouped into 4 treatment groups (5 animals per
group), receiving either vehicle (20% PEG/1% DMSO),
cisplatin (1.5mg/kg), single agent GSK2141795 (30mg/
kg) or combination of GSK2141795 and cisplatin.
Animals received GSK2141795 daily by oral gavage and
cisplatin twice weekly via intraperitoneal (ip) injection.
Tumour sizes were measured every other day for 14
days and growth curves generated for each group. For
time-course studies, following overnight fasting mice
were treated with GSK2141795 (30mg/kg) for 1-72hrs,
as indicated, prior to [18F]FDG administration (~8MBq)
via a jugular vein cannula. For dose-response studies,
following overnight fasting, mice received either vehicle
(20%PEG / 1%DMSO) or GSK2141795 (10, 20 or 30mg/
kg) by oral gavage. At 5hours post-treatment, animals
were administered [18F]FDG (~8 MBq) via a jugular vein
cannula. All animals were scanned on a dedicated small
animal PET scanner (Inveon PET/CT module, Siemens
Molecular Imaging Inc. UK). Animals were kept under
isofluorane anaesthesia throughout imaging. Dynamic
emission scans were acquired in list mode format over
60min. Standardised uptake values (SUV) of radioactivity
were calculated for the tumour region of interest (ROI) for
each image of a dynamic series using the formula:

Identification of proteomic pharmacodynamic
signature
A proteomic pharmacodynamic biomarker signature
was constructed by identifying proteins with significant
protein expression level changes following GSK2141795
treatment, across xenografts and cell lines. Statistical
significance for each protein was evaluated using Rank
Product meta-analysis [28] as implemented in the R
package RankProd, This analysis takes into account the
effects in each individual study, with each cell line treated
as a separate study, 0.5hrs and 8hrs treated as separate
studies, and the xenografts treated as one (separate) study.
Proteins with a meta-analysis significance estimate of p <
0.05 were selected to construct the proteomic PD signature
(Table 1).

Evaluation of proteomic signature levels in
clinical biopsies
The proteins constituting the pharmacodynamic
signature derived from in vitro and in vivo assays were

Oncotarget

mapped to those in the RPPA profiling of biopsies taken
from patients undergoing treatment with GSK2141795
as part of a phase I clinical trial (trial number:
NCT01266954). AKT pathway modulation scores were
derived for each biopsy, including those taken prior to
GSK2141795 treatment, using the improved Gene Set
Enrichment z-score of Irizarry [29]. Briefly, this involves
calculating t-statistics for differential expression of each
protein in the signature in each sample, as compared with
all other samples. A weighted average of these t-statistics
has been shown to be normally distributed and thus can
be used to derive a z-score for each sample, quantifying
the degree of systematic up- or down-regulation of the
set of proteins comprising the signature. Signatures
were calculated for GSK2141795-upregulated and
GSK2141795-downregulated proteins separately.
