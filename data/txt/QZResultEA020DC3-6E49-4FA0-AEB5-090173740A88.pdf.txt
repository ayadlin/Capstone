ABSTRACT
A major problem for cancer patients is the metastasis of cancer cells from the
primary tumor. This involves: (1) migration through the basement membrane; (2)
dissemination via the circulatory system; and (3) invasion into a secondary site.
Metastasis suppressors, by definition, inhibit metastasis at any step of the metastatic
cascade. Notably, Src is a non-receptor, cytoplasmic, tyrosine kinase, which becomes
aberrantly activated in many cancer-types following stimulation of plasma membrane
receptors (e.g., receptor tyrosine kinases and integrins). There is evidence of a
prominent role of Src in tumor progression-related events such as the epithelial–
mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the development of metastasis. However, the
precise molecular interactions of Src with metastasis suppressors remain unclear.
Herein, we review known metastasis suppressors and summarize recent advances
in understanding the mechanisms of how these proteins inhibit metastasis through
modulation of Src. Particular emphasis is bestowed on the potent metastasis
suppressor, N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) and its interactions with
the Src signaling cascade. Recent studies demonstrated a novel mechanism through
which NDRG1 plays a significant role in regulating cancer cell migration by inhibiting
Src activity. Moreover, we discuss the rationale for targeting metastasis suppressor
genes as a sound therapeutic modality, and we review several examples from the
literature where such strategies show promise. Collectively, this review summarizes
the essential interactions of metastasis suppressors with Src and their effects on
progression of cancer metastasis. Moreover, interesting unresolved issues regarding
these proteins as well as their potential as therapeutic targets are also discussed.

and biochemical determinants in these processes are still
largely unknown.
The viral Src (v-Src) gene encoded by the Rous
sarcoma virus was the first defined oncogene and encodes
the first recognized tyrosine kinase [2]. It can initiate and
maintain cell transformation, even though it is irrelevant
to viral replication [3]. Its cellular counterpart, c-Src,
also plays a key role in tumorigenesis and metastatic
progression [4, 5]. This latter molecule belongs to a
family of non-receptor, membrane-associated, tyrosine
kinases, including Fyn, Yes, Blk, Yrk, Fgr, Hck, Lck,
and Lyn [4]. Importantly, c-Src is known to be overexpressed and/or hyper-activated in a wide variety of
human cancers, which is caused by enhanced expression
or dysregulation of upstream growth factor receptors
and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (HER2), platelet-derived growth factor
receptor (PDGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor
(FGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
(VEGF), integrins, or focal adhesion kinase (FAK) [69]. Interestingly, over-expression of these receptors, their
ligands, or both, is common in many tumor-types [1012], and concurs with the fact that deregulation of c-Src
tyrosine kinase activity occurs in various tumors, including
those derived from the colon, pancreas, prostate, etc. [1315]. Once activated, c-Src is involved in the regulation
of oncogenic processes [16]. This, in turn, results in
increased growth factor activity during tumorigenesis and
the development of a metastatic phenotype [7].
Just as tumor promoters, such as oncogenic Ras
or Src, play positive roles in regulating tumorigenesis,
a growing body of literature demonstrates a new
class of proteins, known as metastasis suppressors,
that effectively inhibit metastasis [17, 18]. Examples
of metastasis suppressors include Kangai1 (KAI1/
CD82), E-cadherin, Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor 2
(RhoGDI2), Src-suppressed C kinase substrate (SSeCKS)
and N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) [19].
Interestingly, while these molecules are able to inhibit
the formation of metastases, they generally do not affect
formation of primary tumors [19, 20]. To achieve their
anti-metastatic effects, these molecules regulate key cell
signaling pathways, such as those involving Src, which
directly influence cell motility and invasion [19]. The
number of known metastasis suppressors continues to
grow, but since most have only recently been discovered,
their mechanisms of action are yet to be fully elucidated.
One metastasis suppressor that has recently attracted
increasing interest, due to its potent anti-cancer effects,
is NDRG1. This molecule was first identified as a tumor
suppressor gene in human breast and prostate cancers
[21], in which it was found to reduce cell growth both in
vitro and in vivo [22-25]. Interestingly, over-expression of
NDRG1 in breast, pancreatic and prostate cancer cell lines
result in suppression of metastasis without suppression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of tumorigenicity [26-28]. In clinical studies, NDRG1
was inversely correlated with breast and prostate cancer
metastasis, while being positively correlated with patient
survival [26, 28]. In our recent studies, as well as those
from others, it has been demonstrated that NDRG1 plays a
key role in the regulation of cellular signaling via a variety
of pathways inhibiting cancer cell invasion and migration
[23, 25, 29-31]. These signaling pathways include: (1)
the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/
AKT) and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase
(MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
cascade [29, 32]; (2) the transforming growth factor-β
(TGF-β) pathway [33], leading to the up-regulation of two
key tumor suppressor proteins, namely phosphatase and
tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and
mothers against decapentaplegic homolog-4 (SMAD4)
[29]; (3) the Ras oncogenic pathway [29]; (4) β-catenin
and the WNT pathway [25, 34]; as well as (5) the Rhoassociated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1
(ROCK1)/phosphorylated myosin light chain2 (pMLC2)
pathway [35].
In this review, we provide a perspective on NDRG1
and other metastasis suppressors, namely KAI1/CD82,
E-cadherin, RhoGDI2 and SSeCKS, and the mechanisms
involved in their interplay with the oncogene Src during
tumorigenesis and metastasis. Moreover, we will discuss
the rationale for targeting metastasis suppressor molecules
such as NDRG1 as an emerging therapeutic modality.

SRC KINASE
The most critical feature of tyrosine kinases
is the strict regulation of their activity and functions
[36]. Dysregulation of tyrosine kinase activity leads to
progression of cancers [37]. Below, we briefly discuss
the regulation of Src kinase activity and its role in tumor
metastasis progression.

The regulation of c-Src activity
Structurally, c-Src consists of a unique Src
homology (SH) 4 domain, a SH3 domain, an SH3-SH2
connector, an SH2 domain, an SH2-kinase linker, an SH1
(kinase) domain, and a C-terminal tail regulatory region
(Figure 1A) [36]. The phosphorylation of two tyrosine
sites (Tyr416 in the kinase domain and Tyr527 in the
C-terminal region) and the intra-molecular interactions
among the domains are crucial for the regulation of c-Src
activity (Figure 1B) [38].
c-Src is normally present in its inactive form, in
which Tyr527 is phosphorylated and stabilized by two
key intra-molecular interactions, including: (1) binding
of phosphorylated Tyr527 to its own SH2 domain; and
(2) binding of the SH2-kinase linker to the SH3 domain
(Figure 1B) [39]. These intra-molecular interactions affect
35523

the configuration of the catalytic pocket (Figure 1B). The
de-phosphorylation of Tyr527 releases the ‘lock’ by the
SH2 domain and causes a dramatic conformational change
in the kinase domain, subsequently catalyzing the intramolecular auto-phosphorylation of Tyr416 in the activation
loop (Figure 1B) [40]. This auto-phosphorylation locks
the catalytic domain into the active conformation and
facilitates access of substrates to the active site [40].
The regulation of c-Src activity by intra-molecular
interactions suggests that it can also be regulated
by interaction with molecules that compete with the

functional domains. Indeed, c-Src binds to various
tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins by recognizing specific
phosphopeptide sequences via the SH2 domain [38].
For example, c-Src binds to the phosphorylated forms
of p130Cas, FAK, and paxillin, as well as growth factor
receptors such as EGFR, CSF-1R and PDGFR, resulting
in activation of c-Src [5, 7, 41-43]. Activated c-Src can
further phosphorylate these interacting proteins to create
new binding sites for other adaptors and effectors, which
in turn, allows amplification of down-stream signals
[5, 44, 45]. In addition, the c-Src SH3 domain binds to

Figure 1: The structure of c-Src and regulation of its kinase activity. A. Structurally, c-Src consists of a unique Src homology

(SH) 4 domain, a SH3 domain, a SH3-SH2 connector, a SH2 domain, a SH2-kinase linker, a SH1-kinase domain, and a C-terminal tail
regulatory region. B. The phosphorylation of two tyrosine sites (Tyr416 in the catalytic domain and Tyr527 in C-terminal region) and the
intra-molecular interactions among the domains are crucial for the regulation of c-Src activity. Normally c-Src is present in its inactive
form, in which Tyr527 is phosphorylated and stabilized by two intra-molecular interactions including: (1) binding of phosphorylated
Tyr527 to its own SH2 domain; and (2) binding of the SH2-kinase linker to the SH3 domain. The de-phosphorylation of Tyr527 releases the
‘lock’ from the SH2 domain and causes dramatic conformational change in the kinase domain, subsequently catalyzing the intra-molecular
auto-phosphorylation of Tyr416 in the activation loop.

various signaling proteins that contain proline-rich motifs,
such as Shc, PI3K and p130Cas [46-48]. The interaction
of c-Src with these proteins disrupts the stabilized inactive
conformation of c-Src, resulting in the activation of this
kinase and leads to its down-stream effects, which include
the phosphorylation of these latter signaling proteins [36].
Although the molecular mechanisms of c-Src
activation may vary depending upon the cell-type and
extracellular stimuli, it is now believed that in general, full
activation of c-Src is achieved by a series of events in the
following order: (1) activated receptors such as PDGFR
or EGFR, as well as protein tyrosine kinases such as FAK,
recruit and interact with the SH2/3 domains of inactive
c-Src to open the closed conformation; (2) tyrosine
phosphatases de-phosphorylate the exposed pTyr527
to stabilize the active conformation; and (3) activated
c-Src undergoes inter-molecular auto-phosphorylation
on Tyr416 to lock the catalytic pocket into the fully
active conformation [36, 38]. The fully activated c-Src
can then phosphorylate substrate proteins, such as FAK
and p130Cas, many of which can also create binding
sites for c-Src which initiates the positive-feedback
loop of c-Src activation [5]. When the cell response is
terminated, activated c-Src is rapidly degraded via the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [49], or inactivated by
phosphorylation at Tyr527 [39] and dephosphorylation at
Tyr416 [50, 51]. This highly secure regulatory system is
required in order to strictly control potentially dangerous

c-Src signaling, which possesses inherent oncogenic
activity [36].

The role of Src in cancer metastasis
During tumor progression, metastasis is an
exceedingly complex process where primary tumor cells
invade adjacent tissues, intravasate into the surrounding
microvasculature and travel to distant sites where they may
succeed in forming secondary tumors [52]. The increase
of Src levels in metastasizing cancer cells compared to
non-metastatic cells may represent an important step in
the development of this more aggressive phase of cancer
evolution [9, 53]. A series of studies have shown that Src
activity increases with the progression of many cancers
[15, 54-56]. In fact, Src activation has been used as a
biological marker for tumor progression [54].
Src was found to play a key role in all steps of the
metastatic cascade of colon cancer via its downstream
targets [37, 57]. Specifically, Src promotes cancer cell
detachment from the primary tumor by down-regulating
the cell adhesion molecule, E-cadherin, and increasing
matrix-degrading proteases (MMPs) [14, 58]. Moreover,
it can also enhance cancer-cell focal adhesion via FAK
and integrins (e.g., α5β1 integrin complexes; forming a
focal adhesion complex) [41, 42]. Importantly, studies
revealed that Src increases cell migration by modulating
downstream effectors, such as p130Cas, PEAK, Cool-

Figure 2: KAI1/CD82 suppresses the activity of Src via its upstream activator. KAI1/CD82 plays an important role in cancer

metastasis and was initially identified as a metastasis suppressor. KAI1/CD82 could attenuate EGFR signaling by promoting internalization
of the activated receptor. It also reduces both integrin-dependent and HGF-induced activation of c-Met, subsequently inhibiting signaling
to activate Src, resulting in reduced activation of p130Cas. Moreover, CDCP1, which promotes metastasis via enhancement of Src activity,
was found to be suppressed by KAI1/CD82.

1, etc. [5, 53, 59-62]. Src is also involved in promoting
angiogenesis, which is necessary to support the growth of
secondary tumors [37]. This latter effect occurs through
Src-mediated activation of STAT3 [63], which leads to
increased expression of VEGF and interleukin-8 (IL-8),
both of which are crucial for angiogenesis [52].

Another receptor tyrosine kinase that is suppressed by
KAI1/CD82 is c-Met (also known as the hepatocyte
growth factor receptor; HGFR), which is involved in
oncogenic signaling in cancer cells (Figure 2) [68, 71].
In the prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and PC3, KAI1/
CD82 reduced both integrin-dependent and HGF-induced
activation of c-Met, subsequently inhibiting signaling to
activate Src, resulting in reduced activation of p130Cas
[68]. Other than integrins and EGFR, KAI1/CD82 inhibits
the expression of CUB-domain-containing protein 1
(CDCP1), which itself is known to be involved in the
promotion of metastasis via enhancement of Src activity
(Figure 2) [72]. Indeed, inhibition of CDCP1 expression
via KAI1/CD82 in an in vivo tumor xenograft model, leads
to significantly decreased levels of hypoxia-inducible
factor-1α (HIF-1α) and one of its key down-stream targets,
the angiogenesis promoting protein vascular endothelial
growth factor-1 (VEGF-1) [72].
Moreover, KAI1/CD82 was found to have an
important role in regulating cell-cell adhesion, again
through its effects on inhibiting Src function [73]. Using
the DU145 prostate cancer cell model, over-expression
of KAI1/CD82 induced homotypic cell-cell aggregation
[73]. This increase in cell-cell adhesion can be blocked
by protein phosphatase 1, an inhibitor of Src kinase, or
by the over-expression of a kinase negative Src mutant,
indicating that the effect was mediated as a result of Src
inhibition [73]. These novel findings indicate that KAI1/
CD82 affects multiple targets to inhibit Src activity,
which forms an integral part of its ability to function as a
metastasis suppressor.

THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN SRC AND
METASTASIS SUPPRESSORS
Considering the growing advances in understanding
the function of metastasis suppressors, as well as the
vital role of Src in metastasis development, the interplay
of these important molecules and how they affect
cancer metastasis was important to examine. Hence,
the metastasis suppressors, KAI1/CD82, E-cadherin,
RhoGDI2, SSeCKS and NDRG1, and their interaction
with Src, will be further discussed below.

KAI1/CD82
KAI1/CD82 is a member of the tetraspanin family,
which is known to be involved in the regulation of cell
morphology, proliferation, fusion, motility and the
immune system [64]. This protein plays an important
role in cancer progression being initially identified as a
metastasis-suppressor gene in prostate cancer [65]. Studies
have shown that the expression of KAI1/CD82 is downregulated in most metastatic cancers [64]. Its ability to
inhibit cell motility, invasion and adhesion, together with
the clinical observations that KAI1/CD82 expression
is often lost/reduced in cancer, strongly suggests that
KAI1/CD82 has an anti-oncogenic role in cancer [66].
Importantly, Src has been implicated to interact with
KAI1/CD82 in the progression of several tumors and will
be further discussed below.

KAI1/CD82 suppress the activity of downstream
effectors of Src
Cell migration plays an essential role during cancer
metastasis [74]. Recently, progress has been made in
understanding the signaling pathways that control cell
migration [75]. Signaling pathways directly downstream of Src, which are mediated by p130Cas and CrkII,
were found to determine directional persistence of cell
migration by activating the small GTPases of the Rho
family member Rac1, regulating actin re-organization,
focal contacts, and membrane ruffling [76]. The small
GTPases of the Rho family regulate multiple aspects of
cell motility, such as generation of lamellipodia, assembly
of focal adhesions, retraction of the cell tail, and formation
of stress fibers by either directly acting on cytoskeleton
reorganization or by cross-talk with the above signaling
pathways [77, 78].
Importantly, both p130Cas and CrkII are involved
in Src-mediated cancer cell invasion and migration [79,
80]. Using DU145 metastatic prostate cancer cells as the
experimental model, it was demonstrated that inhibition
of the p130Cas-CrkII pathway is crucial for the KAI1/
CD82-mediated suppression of cell motility in DU145

KAI1/CD82 suppresses the activity of Src
As indicated above, the activation of Src can be
achieved by the interplay of growth factor receptors
(EGFR, PDGFR, etc.) or integrins with Src [7, 43].
Integrins play a key role in cell-matrix adhesion and are
responsible for mediating various signals from the cell
surface to the extracellular matrix [67]. The promoter
role of EGF during tumorigenesis has been very well
recognized and its receptor (EGFR) is presently a target
for many cancer therapies [10].
The association of KAI1/CD82 with integrins and
EGFR has been extensively studied (Figure 2) [68, 69]. In
fact, the activity of KAI1/CD82 in inhibiting cell motility
and invasion is mediated through its ability to modulate
the activity of receptor tyrosine kinases [64, 66, 69, 70].
It has been reported that KAI1/CD82 attenuates EGFR
signaling by promoting internalization and subsequent
degradation of the activated receptor (Figure 2) [69].

cells [81]. In fact, KAI1/CD82 was found to reduce
the level of p130Cas, and consequently, the coupling
of phosphorylated p130Cas and CrkII required for
cell motility [82], was also attenuated (Figure 2). The
reduction in p130Cas was found to occur through posttranscriptional effects, as p130Cas mRNA level was not
affected [81]. However, the precise mechanisms by which
KAI1/CD82 were able to reduce p130Cas protein levels
remains to be elucidated.
Collectively, KAI1/CD82 interacts with Src on
multiple levels, playing an important role in inhibiting the
activation of this latter oncogene, while also suppressing
its downstream effects, ultimately leading to inhibition of
cell motility, angiogenesis and metastasis.

Another metastasis suppressor that is involved in Src
signaling is E-cadherin [83-85]. The human E-cadherin
gene (located on 16q22.1) encodes a calcium-dependent,
120 kDa membrane protein that mediates cell-cell and
cell-matrix adhesion [86]. E-cadherin is an epithelial
adhesion molecule and plays a crucial role in maintaining
the polarity of epithelial cells by preserving tight junctions
and cytoskeletal systems [86, 87]. Increasing evidence
indicates that E-cadherin is reduced in various tumor
tissues, including colorectal cancer [88], breast cancer
[89], prostate cancer [90], etc., compared with their
corresponding normal epithelium. In addition, the loss of

Figure 3: Src modulates cell adhesion through regulation of E-cadherin expression, distribution and function. E-cadherin

is one of the important epithelial adhesion molecules that plays a crucial role in maintaining the polarity of epithelial cells due to the
disruption of tight conjunctions and reorganization of cytoskeleton systems. The decrease in E-cadherin based cell-cell contact induced by
c-Src occurs not only through the prohibited expression of E-cadherin, but also via the enhanced endocytosis and further internalization
of E-cadherin by regulating the E3 ligase, Hakai. Moreover, activated c-Src results in tyrosine phosphorylation of E-cadherin and p120catenin. This effect leads to a weakened association between E-cadherin and p120-catenin that contributes to the instability of E-cadherin
at the adherens junction, as well as E-cadherin ubiquitination and degradation.

E-cadherin on the cell surface enables epithelial-derived
cancer cells to transfer to a mesenchymal-like morphology,
and thus, becoming more aggressive [91].

Hence, the Src-mediated endocytosis of E-cadherin may
directly decrease the distribution of E-cadherin on the
epithelial membrane, and thus, stimulate tumor metastasis
by disrupting cell-cell contacts.
Post-translational regulation of E-cadherin by Srcmediated phosphorylation is an essential requirement
for endocytosis of E-cadherin [101]. The balance of
degradation and re-expression after internalization are
vital factors that affect protein levels and are responsible
for rapid loss of E-cadherin expression [102]. Tyrosine
phosphorylation of E-cadherin and its binding protein,
β-catenin, was found to be strongly enhanced by Src [85].
Following the activation of tyrosine kinases, the tyrosinephosphorylated E-cadherin complex attracts the E3
ligase protein, Hakai, resulting in its ubiquitin-dependent
degradation and endocytosis (Figure 3) [98]. Tyrosine
phosphorylation of E-cadherin was also found to reduce
the association of this latter molecule with p120-catenin,
contributing to the instability of E-cadherin at the adherens
junction [103].
p120-catenin is a component of the cadherin
adhesion complex being associated with E-cadherin,
and is involved in the regulation of cadherin-mediated
cell adhesion [104]. Interestingly, v-Src is able to
phosphorylate p120-catenin in epithelial cells [105], which
weakens its association with E-cadherin and subsequently
affects E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion (Figure 3)
[106]. Considering that p120-catenin anchors E-cadherin
to the actin cytoskeleton via α-catenin (Figure 3) [16,
106, 107], activation of SFKs disrupts these crucial bonds
and leads to the rapid internalization of E-cadherin [16,
42, 95]. Hence, through its ability to inhibit E-cadherin
expression and promote the degradation of this metastasis
suppressor, Src is able to disrupt cancer cell adhesion and
promote cell detachment, the initial step in the metastatic
cascade.

Src inhibits the expression of E-cadherin
Src and other Src-family kinases (SFKs) were
found to inhibit the expression of E-cadherin (Figure 3),
and thus, influencing cell-cell adhesion, cancer invasion
and metastasis [92]. In fact, activated Src, via its SH2
and SH3 domains, induced the EMT by deregulating
E-cadherin and inhibiting its function, while at the same
time promoting assembly of integrin adhesion structures
to promote a mesenchymal state [93]. Moreover, it was
found that active Src caused components of the adherens
junction to be re-distributed to Src-induced integrin
adhesion complexes, leading to the conclusion that
disruption of E-cadherin localization requires integrin
signaling [84]. This was further confirmed by studies
showing that E-cadherin redistribution was blocked by
specific inhibitory antibodies to α or β integrin subunits
[84]. In addition, another study indicated that the Src
family inhibitor, protein phosphatase 2 (PP2), could
enhance E-cadherin/catenin proteins and activate cell
adhesion, which may lead to metastasis suppression [83].
Interestingly, E-cadherin can also be inhibited by
other molecular pathways, namely TGF-β, although this
latter effect was found to be independent of Src [94].
In fact, neither the specific Src family kinase inhibitor,
SU6656, nor a dominant negative Src was able to inhibit
TGF-β mediated EMT [94]. Hence, Src is not essential for
the induction of the EMT, as this process is influenced by
multiple signaling pathways [95, 96].
Paradoxically, while high levels of Src can inhibit
the function of E-cadherin at the adherens junction, low
levels of Src were found to play a positive supporting role
on the function of this adhesion molecule [97]. Moreover,
E-cadherin itself can also activate Src at cell-cell contacts,
which then aids its own function [97]. This indicates that
the interaction between E-cadherin and Src is complex and
is mediated by both the levels of Src and their interaction
at cell junctions.
The reduced levels of E-cadherin by Src are
mediated not only through suppression of E-cadherin
expression, but also via enhanced endocytosis and further
internalization of this molecule (Figure 3) [87]. It was
reported that when Src is activated in MDCK epithelial
cells, the E-cadherin complex is ubiquitinated and
endocytosed, and this was mediated by E-cadherin binding
the E3 ligase, Hakai [98]. Once endocytosed, E-cadherin
degradation was mediated by its shuttling from the
endosome to the lysosome, a process that was mediated
by hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase
substrate (Hrs) and Src-induced activation of the Rab5
and Rab7 GTPases [99]. The membrane redistribution
of E-cadherin molecules engaged in mature junctions
requires endocytosis and subsequent exocytosis [100].

RhoGDI2
RhoGDI2, also known as D4-GDI, Ly-GDI and
ARHGDIB, has also been identified as a metastasis
suppressor protein [108-110]. It belongs to a family of
related proteins that also includes RhoGDI1 and RhoGDI3
[111]. RhoGDIs bind to Rho GTPases, namely Rac1, Rho
and CDC42, sequester them in the cytosol, and maintain
their GDP-bound inactive state [108]. This prevents their
interactions with effectors or other regulatory proteins,
namely GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine
nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs; Figure 4) [108].
RhoGDI2 is ubiquitously expressed, and has been shown
to interact with RhoA, Rac1, and Rac2 [108]. RhoGDI2
has been demonstrated to be a metastasis suppressor in
different cancers, as its expression was decreased or
lost in metastatic cancers, including bladder cancer and
Hodgkin’s lymphoma [109, 112]. Paradoxically, RhoGDI2
has also been shown to promote metastasis in other
35528

cancers, namely ovarian adenocarcinoma, breast cancer,
etc. [113, 114]. These functional differences may be due
to cell type specificity, variations in the experimental
approaches, patient populations, and statistical analyses.

promotes metastatic progression in cancer cells.

Src and RhoGDI2

Src-suppressed C kinase substrate (SSeCKS) is a
metastasis suppressor that is also known as the ortholog
of human GRAVIN/AKAP12 [119]. It was originally
identified in a screen for genes markedly down-regulated
by v-Src [120]. Importantly, there is increasing evidence
suggesting that SSeCKS is reduced in metastases
when compared to the primary tumors in a number of
neoplasms, including prostate, breast, etc. [121-123].
Moreover, SSeCKS has been utilized as a predictive
marker for prostate cancer metastasis [122]. These studies
indicate that loss of SSeCKS expression is correlated with
increased metastatic potential of human malignancies.
Current evidence suggests that SSeCKS functions
as a scaffold protein, which controls mitogenic signaling
and cytoskeletal remodeling by binding key signaling
mediators such as PKC, PKA, calmodulin, F-actin,
cyclins, Src and phospholipids in a spatiotemporal
manner [124]. SSeCKS also participates in the control of
cytoskeletal reorganization associated with motility, which
is most likely facilitated by domains that link it to both

SSeCKS

The phosphorylation of RhoGDI1 and RhoGDI2
by Src was shown to inhibit the ability of these former
proteins to complex with Rho GTPases, allowing these
latter proteins to become active [115]. In fact, RhoGDI2
phosphorylation by Src decreased its association with
Rac1, leading to an increase of the active Rac1-GTP
(Figure 4). Interestingly, phosphorylation of RhoGDI2
by Src at Tyr153 and, to a lesser degree, Tyr24, not only
decreased the amount of Rac1 in RhoGDI2 complexes, it
also increased RhoGDI2 association with cell membranes
[116]. The function of RhoGDI2 at the cell membrane
remains to be elucidated, although it has been speculated
to contribute to its anti-metastatic effects [116].
Rho GTPases play a critical role in cellular
activities, including growth and differentiation, apoptosis,
cell motility, and various other aspects of cytoskeletal
dynamics and cell polarity [117, 118]. Hence, through its
ability to phosphorylate RhoGDI2, Src is able to promote
the activation of Rho GTPase proteins and subsequently

Figure 4: Src increases Rac1 activity by phosphorylating RhoGDI2. RhoGDI2 binds to Rho GTPases, sequestering them in
the cytosol, which subsequently inhibits the activation of the Rho proteins and prevents their interaction with effectors or other regulatory
proteins such as GAPs and GEFs. Src activation can modulate the RhoGDI2-Rho GTPase complex formation by phosphorylating RhoGDI2
at Tyr153, which could free Rac1 from its association with RhoGDI2. Subsequently, Rac1 then goes back into a functional cycle between
GDP-bound Rac1 or GTP-bound Rac1.

plasma membrane and cytoskeletal sites [125].

SSeCKS also suppressed adhesion-induced Src activation
(phosphorylated Src at Tyr416) and phosphorylation of
FAK at Tyr925, a known Src substrate site [133].
Another mechanism by which SSeCKS might
disengage active Src from down-stream oncogenic
signaling is based on the identification of a Src scaffolding
domain in SSeCKS, which is homologous to the Srcbinding domain in Caveolin-1 (Figure 5B) [133]. A
recent model suggested that SSeCKS enhanced relative
adhesion-induced FAK phosphorylation levels at Tyr397,
yet suppressed phosphorylation at Tyr925, suggesting
that Src is disengaged by SSeCKS from normal FAK/Src
complexes. Direct binding between Src and SSeCKS via a
domain homologous to the Src-binding site on Caveolin-1
was observed [133]. Hence, SSeCKS attenuates Src’s
ability to induce metastatic progression by directly
sequestering Src from its down-stream targets.
Using cDNA microarrays and semi-quantitative RTPCR analysis, it was found that SSeCKS re-expression
resulted in the attenuation of critical Src-induced
proliferative and pro-angiogenic genes including Afp,
Hif-1α, Cdc20a and Pdgfr-β [134]. Conversely, SSeCKS
induced several cell cycle regulatory genes such as Ptpn11,
Gadd45a, Ptplad1, Cdkn2d (p19), and Rbbp7 [134].
Together, these studies indicate that SSeCKS can
suppress Src-induced oncogenesis by modulating gene
expression down-stream of Src kinase activity.

Src suppresses the expression of SSeCKS
SSeCKS was found to be down-regulated by
several oncogenes (Ras, Src, Myc, Jun, Fos, Wnt1, etc.)
in various cancers including prostate, lung, gastric, breast
and ovarian [121-123, 126-128]. However, the mechanism
by which SSeCKS is down-regulated by Src still remains
unclear. The fact that SSeCKS is down-regulated by
specific group of oncogenes like Src, Myc, Jun, etc., but
not other oncogenes such as Raf, Mos, or Neu, suggests
that it is controlled by specific mitogenic and oncogenic
pathways [129].
Studies have elucidated several mechanisms by
which SSeCKS is transcriptionally regulated. In humans,
SSeCKS transcription is driven by three independent
promoters, which encode for three different SSeCKS
transcripts, namely α, β and γ [130]. v-Src was found to
repress SSeCKS transcription through its effects on the
E- and GC-boxes in the SSeCKS α proximal promoter,
which are bound by the transcription factors, USF1 and
SP1/3, respectively [131]. In fact, v-Src promoted the
complex formation between USF1 and SP1/3, increasing
the binding of SP1/3 to the SSeCKS α promoter [131].
This led to the recruitment of HDAC, which prompted
a chromatin structure change that affected both the
α and the down-stream β promoters and resulted in
suppressed SSeCKS expression [131]. Another study
revealed that the transcription factor, TFII-I, which
converts to a transcriptional repressor once it has been at
phosphorylated at Tyr248 by activated Src, also plays an
important role in the Src-induced suppression of SSeCKS
transcription [132].

NDRG1
NDRG1 (also known as Drg1, RTP, Rit42,
PROXY-1 or Cap43) belongs to the human NDRG family,
which also comprises NDRG2, NDRG3 and NDRG4
that share a 53–64% amino acid identity with each other
[21, 136-138]. The NDRG1 gene has been mapped to
chromosome 8q24.3 (8q24.2 in the AceView database
[139]) [140] and encodes a stable protein which is
ubiquitously expressed and predominantly cytosolic [24].

SSeCKS inhibits Src oncogenic effects via disengaging
active Src from its down-stream effectors
Interestingly, while Src can inhibit SSeCKS
transcription, this latter metastasis suppressor can also
inhibit Src activity by disrupting the link between Src
and its down-stream mediators [133, 134]. In fact,
SSeCKS inhibits oncogenic motility and invasiveness by
disengaging growth factor-activated Src from activating
the PKC-Raf-MEK-ERK pathways that control the
formation of podosome/invadosome structures and
promote the expression/secretion of MMPs [124, 135].
This, together with the fact that SSeCKS alters the
actin-based cytoskeletal architecture [125], suggests that
SSeCKS inhibits Src oncogenic signaling by physically
sequestering it away from downstream signaling
mediators.
The ability of SSeCKS to sequester Src from
FAK, which play a crucial role in mediating signaling
to the actin-based cytoskeleton, inhibits the FAK/Src
complex (Figure 5A) [133] . In fact, SSeCKS directly
sequesters Src pools from FAK complexes to lipid rafts
in the plasma membrane, attenuating the ability of Src
to induce metastatic progression (Figure 5A) [133].

Functions of NDRG1 in cancer
NDRG1 is a multifunctional protein involved in
tumorigenesis and tumor development, and its function
differs in different tumor-types [22, 24, 141]. In colorectal,
prostate, cervical, and ovarian cancers, NDRG1 plays
important roles in preventing tumor progression and
metastasis, which suggests that NDRG1 has a role as
a tumor suppressor, metastasis suppressor, or both in
these cancers [23, 142-144]. However, in hepatocellular
carcinoma, NDRG1 enhances portal vein invasion and
intra-hepatic metastasis, indicating that this protein plays
pleiotropic roles, with its activity being context-dependent
[145]. Hence, it is clear that NDRG1 plays an important
role in the promotion or inhibition of carcinogenesis
depending on factors such as the cell-type.
NDRG1 has been demonstrated to inhibit primary
tumor growth in vitro and in vivo [21, 146]. In vitro studies
35530

Oncotarget

demonstrated that over-expression of NDRG1 significantly
decreased the proliferation rate of MCF7 breast and EJ
bladder cancer cell lines [21]. Moreover, these cells were
also found to form smaller colonies on soft agar relative
to control cells [21]. Further, mice injected with NDRG1
over-expressing EJ bladder cancer cells exhibited smaller
tumors compared to those injected with control EJ bladder
cancer cells [21]. Subsequent studies reported a reduction
in tumor microvascular density, invasion depth and
histopathological grading, with a corresponding increase
in overall survival rates for pancreatic cancer patients with
higher levels of NDRG1 expression [27]. Interestingly,
in this latter study, although NDRG1 over-expression
reduced tumor growth in vivo, cell growth was not affected
in vitro, potentially due to in vivo modulatory factors such
as those associated with the stroma and angiogenesis [27].
The establishment of metastatic lesions is dependent
upon successful initiation of angiogenesis, a process that is
essential for providing the oxygen and nutrients required
for cell growth. Interestingly, NDRG1 was found to inhibit
the process of angiogenesis by negatively regulating
critical pro-angiogenic factors, such as IL-8, MMP-9 and
VEGF1, in pancreatic cancer [27]. Moreover, NDRG1
has been shown to suppress angiogenesis via attenuating

the expression and phosphorylation of the inhibitor of κB
kinase (IκBα) and subsequently NF-κB signaling [147].
In addition to its effects on primary tumor growth,
the role of NDRG1 as a metastasis suppressor has been
demonstrated in vitro [26, 28] and in vivo [25, 31, 146,
148]. NDRG1 was shown to inhibit metastasis by
decreasing cell–cell and cell–matrix adhesion in AT6.1
rat prostate cancer cells [149] and to inhibit metastasis
to lungs without affecting primary tumor growth in a
SCID mouse model [26]. NDRG1 expression was also
found to inhibit cell proliferation in the metastatic colonic
cancer cell line, HCT116 [150]. Further, suppression
of NDRG1 was demonstrated to significantly enhance
cell proliferation, migration and invasion in Ishikawa
endometrial cancer cells [151]. In contrast, overexpression of NDRG1 was shown to inhibit cellular
proliferation and migration of this latter cell line [151].
Recently, NDRG1 has been shown to suppress
metastasis by a mechanism involving the modulation of
the structural protein actin [35]. In cancer cells, actin is
polymerized to form stress fibers that are required for
cell migration [152]. NDRG1 has been demonstrated to
inhibit the Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein
kinase 1 (ROCK1)/phosphorylated myosin light chain 2

Figure 5: Src abrogates the function of the FAK/Src complex. A. SSeCKS attenuates the ability of Src to induce metastatic

(pMLC2) pathway [35], which would result in suppression
of the assembly and rearrangement of stress fibers from
actin [153]. Furthermore, NDRG1 modulates metastasis
via proteins including MMPs, which degrade extracellular
matrix, and adhesion molecules, such as β-catenin and
E-cadherin that form the adherens junction at the cell
membrane [33, 34, 154]. In agreement with these latter
studies, NDRG1 has also been demonstrated to promote
the membrane expression of β-catenin in breast, prostate
and colon cancer cells [25, 34]. Further, NDRG1 has also
been shown to inhibit the TGF-β-induced EMT and to
restore membrane β-catenin and E-cadherin levels, which
are suppressed by TGF-β in cancer cells [33]. Together,
these observations indicate that NDRG1 promotes the

formation of the adherens junction, which is critical for
cell–cell adhesion, and elucidates the mechanisms by
which this molecule is able to suppress metastasis in
cancer cells.
Src and NDRG1 interactions
Considering the significant roles of both NDRG1
and Src in cancer metastasis [9, 24, 29, 34, 155], we
recently conducted studies that explored the potential
interplay of these two molecules [156]. It was discovered
that in both prostate cancer DU145 and colon cancer
HT29 cell models, NDRG1 over-expression significantly
decreased Src phosphorylation at Tyr416, while it had no
significant effect on Src phosphorylation at Tyr527 or total
c-Src levels (Figure 6A) [156]. Further, incubation of these

Figure 6: A. NDRG1 inhibits Src activity and its downstream signaling pathway. B. Line drawings of the structures of potential anti-

metastatic agents under development. A. NDRG1 expression inhibits c-Src phosphorylation at its activating site (Tyr416). This occurs
through NDRG1-induced reduction in EGFR expression, abrogation of EGF-mediated EGFR activation, and thus preventing the EGFRc-Src interaction. Moreover, NDRG1 was shown to suppress Rac1 activity by modulating the phosphorylation of a c-Src down-stream
effector, namely p130Cas and its association with CrkII, which acts as a molecular switch to activate Rac1. B. Line drawings of: Genistein,
KISS1-derived peptide, etoposide, atrasentan, di-2-pyridylketone 4,4,-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT) and di-2-pyridylketone

cells with the EGF ligand revealed that NDRG1 affected
c-Src activation via decreasing EGFR expression, leading
to loss of activated EGFR, and thus, preventing the EGFRc-Src interaction (Figure 6A) [156].
Moreover, a key substrate and down-stream
effector of Src, namely p130Cas, was also inhibited
by NDRG1 expression [156]. That is, over-expression
of NDRG1 markedly reduced the phosphorylation of
p130Cas at Tyr249 and Tyr410 (Figure 6A), both of
which are located in the substrate-binding domain and are
vital for p130Cas activation [80, 157]. Importantly, the
modulation of p130Cas activation by NDRG1 occurred
in a Src-dependent manner, as transient silencing Src
expression or pharmacologically inhibiting Src activity
reversed the inhibitory effect of NDRG1 on p130Cas
[156]. As described above, phosphorylation of p130Cas
promotes its binding to CrkII, which subsequently recruits
DOCK180, leading to the activation of the Rho family
GTPase Rac1 [156]. In fact, as a result of its effect on
p130Cas, NDRG1 was also able to suppress Rac1 activity,
as demonstrated by a Rac1 activation assay assessing the
levels of GTP-bound Rac1 (GTP-Rac1; Figure 6A) [156].
When migration assay experiments were performed, it was
shown that NDRG1 reduced cancer cell migration through
inhibition of Src activation [156].
Considering its marked anti-metastatic activity,
NDRG1 presents a promising molecular target for antimetastatic agents. In fact, a novel class of pharmacological
agents were found to significantly up-regulate NDRG1
expression in a range of neoplasms [23, 32, 158, 159].
As a result, these agents were also found to decrease
Src activation [156]. These recent findings highlight the
potential of metastasis suppressors as novel therapeutic
targets and this is further discussed below.

METASTASIS

THERAPEUTIC TARGETS

an agent for re-induction of KAI1/CD82, was shown to
inhibit the invasive behavior of prostate tumor cells in
nude mice [160]. Moreover, administration of the KISS1derived peptide, Metastin (Figure 6B), demonstrated
promising anti-metastatic effects on melanoma cells in a
preclinical study [161].
There are also other examples of re-expression
or induction to develop therapies targeting metastasis
suppressor genes. As mentioned above, KAI1/CD82
acts as metastasis suppressor in many malignant tumors
[64, 66]. Several strategies have been employed to reexpress KAI1/CD82 in cancer cells via targeting its
transcription [162, 163]. The tumor suppressor, p53, has
been demonstrated to increase transcription of KAI1/
CD82 through a p53-responsive element [162]. This
concept led to the use of etoposide (Figure 6B), an agent
that induces p53, and increases KAI1/CD82 expression
in prostate cancer [163]. Another potential therapeutic
agent, namely atrasentan (Figure 6B), which is currently
in Phase III trials for stage IV prostate cancer, was shown
to antagonize endothelin 1, a down-stream molecules of
metastasis of RhoGDI2, mimicking the role of RhoGDI2
and reducing T24T cell metastases in animal models [164,
165].
A novel class of anti-cancer agents currently under
development are the thiosemicarbazones [166-168], that
selectively target cancer cells based on their increased
requirements for iron [169-172]. Iron plays a crucial
role in proliferation and DNA synthesis and neoplastic
cells have an increased requirement for iron as shown
by their markedly elevated expression of the transferrin
receptor 1 and enhanced uptake of iron [171, 173, 174].
Novel thiosemicarbazones bind iron and copper in cancer
cells and also form redox active complexes which results
in multiple down-stream effects [175-177] and alter
the expression of a variety of proteins involved in cell
cycle control, such as members of the cyclin family and
cyclin-dependent kinases [166, 178, 179]. Importantly,
these agents also up-regulate the growth and metastasis
suppressor protein, NDRG1 [158], which has been shown
to be vital in the progression and outcome of a variety of
neoplasms [24, 25, 31, 180-182], as described above. Iron
chelators up-regulate NDRG1 via HIF-1α-dependent and
-independent mechanisms [158], with iron depletion being
required for this effect to occur [158, 178].
A variety of chelators have been developed, with
ligands of the di-2-pyridylketone thiosemicarbazone
(DpT) class, including di-2-pyridylketone 4,4-dimethyl3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT; Figure 6B) and
di-2-pyridylketone
4-cyclohexyl-4-methyl-3thiosemicarbazone (DpC; Figure 6B), demonstrating the
most potent and selective anti-cancer activity both in vitro
and in vivo against a range of different tumor cells [32, 33,
167, 168, 180, 183]. We have recently demonstrated that
both Dp44mT and DpC act to markedly increase NDRG1
expression, which subsequently also led to the inhibition

AS

Identification of proteins that inhibit dissemination
of cancer cells will provide new perspectives to define
novel therapeutics. Based on the function of metastasis
suppressor genes in cancer regression, they have become
a hot topic for therapeutic approaches. Several strategies
have been developed to potentiate the expression of
metastasis suppressors. These strategies include direct
administration of the gene product, re-expression of the
endogenous locus, restoration of function by gene therapy,
and identification of downstream effectors associated with
the loss of metastasis suppressor proteins, which have
been summarized [19].
Development of anti-metastatic drugs that trigger or
mimic the effect of metastasis suppressors represents new
therapeutic approaches to improve patient survival [19].
A number of drugs that can restore or mimic the effect
of target proteins have proven promising in preclinical
and clinical studies. For example, genistein (Figure 6B),

of Src activity, suggesting the therapeutic efficacy of
these agents involves the suppression of this oncogene
[156]. Notably, DpC is currently under active preclinical
development and clinical trials are planned in 2015 [24,
166, 184], which hopefully will lead to the development of
new anti-cancer therapeutics in the near future.
As the field grows, and additional novel strategies
for therapeutic intervention are developed, the number
and kind of targets are likely to increase. Moreover, future
candidate metastasis suppressor genes may also prove
tractable as pharmacological targets.

This review has briefly summarized the known
molecular interactions between the potent oncogene
Src and a variety of metastasis suppressors. However,
as discussed, the role of Src in cancer metastasis can
be multifaceted, with this latter oncogene being able to
negatively regulate a number of metastasis suppressors,
while itself being a target for these proteins. This further
indicates the complex relationship between Src and
metastasis suppressors, which participate in a delicate
balance that ultimately determines a cell’s ability to invade
and metastasize. Importantly, understanding the complex
interaction between c-Src and key metastasis suppressors
such as NDRG1 has resulted in the development of
new anti-metastatic therapies such as the novel agents,
Dp44mT and DpC.
