ABSTRACT
Erythropoietin (EPO) is a frequently prescribed anti-anemic drug for patients
with advanced renal carcinoma. However, recent evidence from clinical studies
suggested that EPO accelerated tumor progression and jeopardized the 5-year
survival. Herein, we show, starting from the in silico microarray bioinformatics
analysis, that activation of Erythropoietin signaling pathway enhanced renal clear
carcinoma (RCC) progression. EPO accelerated the proliferative and migratory ability
in 786-O and Caki-2 cells. Moreover, comparative proteomics expression profiling
suggested that exogenous EPO stimulated RCC progression via up-regulation of
KIAA0101 expression. Loss of KIAA0101 impeded the undesirable propensity of EPO in
RCC. Finally, low expression of KIAA0101 was associated with the excellent prognosis
and prognosticated a higher 5-year survival in human patients with renal carcinoma.
Overall, KIAA0101 appears to be a key promoter of RCC malignancy induced by EPO,
which provide mechanistic insights into KIAA0101 functions, and pave the road to
develop new therapeutics for treatment of cancer-related and chemotherapy-induced
anemia in patients with RCC.

occurring in more than 40% of cases [11]. The nature of
cancer-induced anemia is multi-factorial with potential
contributing factors including blood loss from surgery,
tumor-associated bleeding, nutritional deficiencies,
chronic inflammation and even the myelosuppressive
effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy [11].
Accumulating clinical evidence from large
randomized trials indicated erythropoiesis-stimulating
agents (ESAs) benefit individuals with cancer-induced
anemia. ESAs treatment, especially for recombinant
human erythropoietin (r-Hu EPO), has become an
indispensable procedure of supportive therapy for cancer
patients with anemia [12, 13]. EPO elevates red blood
cell count, hemoglobin and hematocrit peripheral blood
system, which results in the improvement of quality of life
in patients with anemia. However, a double-edged sword
acting mediated by EPO in cancer patients gradually
embodied and its beneficial effects on cancer patients has
been recently challenged. Large clinical researches aimed
at the correction of breast cancer [14], lung cancer and
cervical cancer [15] have raised the question that EPO
treatment jeopardized the overall survival rate in cancer

INTRODUCTION
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) constitutes about 2 to
3% of all adult malignancies with approximately 271, 000
new cases and 116,000 related deaths estimated worldwide
[1]. RCC is classified histologically into several types,
including clear cell RCC (ccRCC), the most common and
aggressive type accounting for 70 to 80% of all kidney
cancers [2]. By far, multiple etiological factors including
obesity [3], dietary habits [4], alcohol drinking [5],
smoking [6] and even occupational exposure to specific
carcinogens [7] have been attested to have a first-degree
relative with RCC malignancy. Besides, genetic mutations
or functional loss of tumor suppressor genes such as
VHL, BAP1, PBRM1 and SETD2, also contribute to RCC
cachexia [8]. Interestingly, in some cases, malignancies
are often manifested owing to their clinical manifestations
including skeletal muscle atrophy, anemia, weakness
or anorexia [9]. All of these cancer-associated systemic
diseases (CASS) entail a significant reduction in quality
of life and even shorten 5-year survival rate [10]. Among
them, anemia is a frequent finding in cancer patients

patients with anemia. Although conflicting data on EPO
have been implicated to play a role in tumorigenesis and
progression, little is known about whether and how EPO
regulate RCC progression.
KIAA0101, also referred as PAF15 (proliferating
cell unclear antigen-associated factor), encodes a PCNA
(proliferating cell nuclear antigen)-associated factor
[16]. KIAA0101 has been verified to regulate DNA
synthesis and cell cycle progression [17]. Inhibition of
KIAA0101 in cancer cells improved cancer cells sensitive
to ultraviolet. In addition, levels of KIAA0101 are also
found to be up-regulated in cancer tissues from patients
with esophageal, gastric and lung carcinoma [18–20].
Hence, KIAA0101 potentially functions as an oncogene in
tumor progression. However, it is still unknown whether
EPO regulates KIAA0101 expressed in RCC of clear cell
type. It is a clinically important question in light of the
reported unwanted side effects by EPO in tumor patients
with anemia. Herein, we demonstrated KIAA0101 as a
positive, yet previously unrecognized, regulator of ccRCC
proliferation and migration induced by recombinant
human erythropoietin (r-Hu EPO). Our work suggests an

unfavorable role of KIAA0101 in the mechanism by which
EPO elicits an undesired response that maybe important to
sustain RCC progression.

RESULTS
CcRCC regulatory network modules
construction
Totally, 22,639 probes were matched in the
integrated cohort from three different ccRCC microarrays
(Supplementary material 1). To elevate the reproducibility
and obtain stable gene signatures driven ccRCC
progression, virtual microarray datasets originated
from the combined metadata were generated randomly
(Table  1) and performed significance analysis of
microarray (SAM) analysis respectively using student’s
t test comparison, which resulted in the generation
of a cohort of up (red dots) and/or down (green dots)
regulated genes (Figure  1A). To understand how these
signatures regulate ccRCC progression, we matched
the relationships between signatures and human cancer

signaling atlas, which were obtained from literature
curation and established warehouses. As shown in Figure
1B, 6 out of 8 network modules derived by the 8 simulated
microarrays were thought to be involved in ccRCC and 27
gene signatures have been attested to be robust according
to the gene expression (Figure 2A) and unsupervised
hierarchical clustering analysis (Figure 2B). In addition,
three dimension principal component analysis (PCA) also
indicated that 100% (27/27) of ccRCC patients could be
correctly classified from the vehicle groups (Figure 2C).
To further understand the biological processes involved
in the pathogenesis, we performed a pathway enrichment
analysis in terms of the global canonical pathway using
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), which represents
immunology and inflammation pathways (such as B cell
receptor signaling, IL signaling, IGF signaling, GM-CSF
signaling pathway, etc.), Erythropoietin signaling, ERK/
MAPK signaling and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways
were closely associated with the human renal carcinoma
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network (Figure 2D).

was conducted. Simultaneous quantifications of
multiparameter obtained from the same microscopic areas
indicated that 50 IU/mL EPO dramatically increases tumor
cell counts (BrdU, Figure 3D and 3E) and DNA content
(DAPI, 2N verse 4N, Figure 3E), which illustrates that
r-Hu EPO promotes 786-O and Caki-2 cells proliferative
activity.

Exogenous EPO increases migratory capacity in
786-O and Caki-2 cells
To evaluate the pro-metastatic ability of EPO on
RCC in vitro, 786-O and Caki-2 cells were pre-cultured
with serum free medium for 24 h and treated with r-Hu
EPO (10 to 50 IU/mL). The wounding healing assay
showed that both 786-O and Caki-2 cells had a faster
migratory rate than the untreated cells among all of the
concentrations used and 50 IU/mL EPO exhibited the
strongest pro-migratory ability (Figure 4A and 4B). To
further confirm the results mentioned above, we performed
cell migration assay using the Boyden chamber. Consistent
with the scratch assay, 786-O and Caki-2 cells treated with
EPO displayed significant more migratory ability than the
control group, resulting in more tumor cells across the
Transwell membrane (Figure 4C and 4D). Thus, these
results suggested that r-Hu EPO could accelerate the
proliferative and migratory ability in 786-O and Caki-2
cells.

CcRCC cells secrete endogenous EPO and
express authentic EPO receptor protein
On the basis of the bioinformatics analysis,
Erythropoietin signaling pathway seemed to be engaged
in ccRCC malignancy, which intrigued the interest of our
further investigation. To examine whether ccRCC cells
produce EPO, we measured EPO expression by ELISA.
Quantification results showed that both 786-O and Caki-2
cells secreted EPO (from 14.35 to 41.35 pg/mL, Figure 3A),
whereas the EPO secretion was 89% higher in 786-O
compared to Caki-2 cells. To determine whether malignant
RCC cells express EPO receptor (EPOR), 786-O and Caki2 cells were lysed and examined. Figure 3B showed the
Western Blot results of EPOR obtained from 786-O and
Caki-2 cells, respectively. Lane 1 (786-O) and 2 (Caki-2)
depict the immunoreactive EPOR protein bands, with an
approximate molecular mass of 70 KD.

Identification of high confidence predicted
protein targets induced by exogenous r-Hu
EPO in 786-O cell
To understand how r-Hu EPO regulates RCC
proliferation and migration, we introduce a proteomics
profiling in quiescent 786-O cell with or without EPO
treatment. Analysis of the control and EPO treated 786-O
cell protein fractions reveals a high degree of overlap
among each biological replication. Of the 4,781 proteins
identified by LC-LTQ-Orbitrap-MS (Supplementary
material 2), only 17 proteins were identified to be
differently expressed in the EPO treated 786-O cell
compared to the control groups (Table 2 and Figure 5A).
In order to construct a reliable PPI network
mediated by r-Hu EPO, 17 proteins differently expressed
in the one-Dimensional SDS-PAGE proteomics  assay
were imported into the integration package of
BisoGenet. As shown in Figure 5B, the PPI network
mediated by r-Hu EPO contained 17 root proteins and
1,242 interactors. That is, all together, 1,259 nodes and
1,426 interactions. To identify and pinpoint the proteins
that are most likely to drive the aggressive phenotype
of RCC induced by EPO, we calculated the topological
parameters. For each seed proteins, we counted the
number of neighbors in the regulatory network and

Exogenous EPO promotes 786-O and Caki-2
cells proliferation
To examine the consequences of EPO exposure
on ccRCC cells, we firstly treated 786-O and Caki-2
cells with a range of concentrations of exogenous r-Hu
EPO (from 10 to 50 IU/mL) for 48 h and measured the
relative cell viability using MTS assay. In the presence
of 50 IU/mL r-Hu EPO, the proliferative ability of 786-O
and Caki-2 cells were perceptibly enhanced compared to
the vehicle group, suggesting r-Hu EPO has a stimulative
effect on RCC cell proliferation (Figure 3C).
To further confirm the undesired pro-proliferative
effect of r-Hu EPO-induced cell survival, multiparameter

interacted with KIAA0101 and an imbalance of these
regulations would result in aberrant nuclear-transcribed
mRNA catabolic processes. Thus, to test the causeeffect of KIAA0101 protein expression, we knocked
down KIAA0101 in 786-O and Caki-2 cells using RNA
interference (Figure 6A and 6B). For the proliferation
assay, MTS results showed that EPO treatment caused
marked cell viability loss with a significant reduction
of 25% in si-KIAA0101 Caki-2 cells. However, as
to the 786-O cell, knockdown of KIAA0101 could
not antagonize the pro-proliferative capacity by

average clustering coefficient (CC) distribution. As
shown in Figure 5C and 5D, among these root nodes
regulated by EPO, KIAA0101 was ranked as the top
roots and interacted with 843 transcription factors with
the lowest average CC parameter (CCKIAA0101=0).

and 8K, p < 0.05). Besides, high levels of KIAA0101 and
EPO gene expression in cancer tissues from patients with
breast cancer (GSE1456) revealed a shortened relapse-free
survival rate, as indicated by Figure 8I and 8L. Thus, these
finding mentioned above confirmed the negative clinical
significance for KIAA0101 and EPO in cancer patients,
which spurred us on to greater efforts to further understand
the nature of KIAA0101 and EPO in tumorigenesis.

tumors. As shown in Figure 7C to 7E, mRNA levels of
KIAA0101 were significantly up-regulated in the primary
tumor tissues of patients with renal carcinoma in many
independent studies. Similarly, KIAA0101 was also found
to be elevated in multiple cancer subtypes, such as breast
(Figure 7F), hepatocellular (Figure 7G) and pancreatic
cancers (Figure 7H).
For the prognostic value of KIAA0101 and EPO
expression in the primary tumors, GSE33371 (renal
carcinoma), GSE13507 (bladder carcinoma) and
GSE1456 (breast carcinoma) were downloaded from
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. As shown
in Figure 8A to 8C, the mRNA levels of KIAA0101 were
much higher than EPO in cancer samples. In addition,
KIAA0101 and EPO expression were found to be
positively correlated in the dataset of 23 renal carcinoma,
164 bladder carcinoma and 159 breast carcinoma samples
(Figure 8D to 8F). As to renal carcinoma, patients with
low levels of KIAA0101 and EPO had a relative higher
3 and 5-year survival rate (Figure 8G and 8J, KIAA0101:
p = 0.0367, EPO: p = 0.0863). Similarly, the GSE13507

survival rate in bladder carcinoma patients (Figure  8H

DISCUSSION
Most cancer patients with RCC show various degree
of anemia, a major source of morbidity and mortality
with a poor life quality. Thus, it is therefore critical
to better understand whether the correction of anemia
in RCC patients would discriminate aggressive from
indolent RCC. In this study, we demonstrated that human
ccRCC cell lines expressed authentic EPOR and secreted
endogenous EPO. The activation of Erythropoietin
signaling pathway by r-Hu EPO accelerated ccRCC cell
growth and metastasis in vitro. These results further
proved the potential undesired side effects of EPO to treat
or prevent cancer-associated anemia in clinical findings.

KIAA0101 were up-regulated in 61 human primary cancer
tissues from patients with gastric cancer. Suppression of

KIAA0101 by RNA interference inhibited cell viability
and prolonged overall survival [18]. Besides, overexpression of KIAA0101 also predicts a poor prognosis in
lung cancer patients [21]. Consistent with the previously
published data, we discovered EPO increased KIAA0101

interference attenuated cell growth and migration in 786-O
and Caki-2 cells induced by EPO. To further determine if
KIAA0101 and EPO expression are of clinical relevance,
we interrogated databases of gene expression in patient
samples from GEO database. Multiple independent
datasets of patient samples indicated that mRNA levels
of KIAA0101 were much higher in the primary tumor of
patients with renal, breast, liver and pancreatic cancer.
Clinical survival analysis also revealed that low levels of
KIAA0101 are associated with an increased longer survival
time. Similarly, endogenous EPO expression was also
negatively correlated with cancer patients’ survival. In
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

addition, correlated analysis indicated that the expression
of KIAA0101 and EPO expression was positively in
clinical tumor samples. Therefore, EPO coordinates the
expression of KIAA0101 that cooperate to accelerate
ccRCC progression and decreased 3 and 5 year survival.
Unlike the Caki-2 cells, 786-O cell line lacks the
VHL tumor suppressor gene [22]. Although the promigratory capacity of EPO were similar in both 786O and Caki-2 cells, the mitogenic responses towards
EPO were quite different before and after KIAA0101
knockdown. In 786-O cells, when knockdown
of KIAA0101protein, r-Hu EPO still elicited its
deteriousness on cell viability. In contrast, Caki-2

cells responded with decrease in proliferation when
treated with 50 IU/mL EPO. The differences in growth
response between 786-O and Caki-2 cells are quite
puzzling and lack explanations. In our present study,
we observed the increased proliferative advantage of
VHL-deficient 786-O cells revealed a more aggressive
phenotype compared with the Caki-2 cells. According
to the previous publications, it is conceivable that loss
of wild type VHL protein expression resulted in the
enhancement of proliferative and angiogenic activity
in patients with RCC, as described by Paulsen et al.
[23]. Thus, these differences indicated the fact that
only patients with VHL gene can be treated with EPO
for RCC-induced anemia when co-administration with
KIAA0101 inhibitors.
In conclusion, using an integrative systems
biological approach, we determined the role of EPO
signaling pathway in ccRCC progression, and identified
an undesired role of KIAA0101 in ccRCC proliferation
and migration induced by EPO, which have not previously
been linked KIAA0101 to kidney cancer cachexia elicited
by EPO.

mismatching [30]. To overcome the problem of low
sample sizes in typical microarray studies, various
cross-study normalization algorithms such as empirical
Bayes (EB) [31], median rank scores (MRS) or
quantile discretization (QD) [32], NorDi [33], Quantile
discretization normalization (QDISC) [32], XPN [34]
and Median Rank Score Normalization (MNORM) [32]
were employed to decrease non-biological bias and
variance. Since EB method has been applied widely to
a large variety of microarray datasets analysis owing to
its ability to robustly handle high-dimensional data when
sample sizes are small, in this present study, we used EB
algorithm to adjust for batch effects normalization for
ccRCC [35].

Microarray simulation and significantly
expressed gene identification
High-throughput screening (HTS) technique
facilitates rapid translation of molecular targets
identification to clinical diagnostics and therapeutics.
However, tumor heterogeneity is still a large challenge
which prevents the robustness of gene signatures
especially when the sample size was relative small [36].
In order to overcome such a disposition and provide robust
cancer biomarkers, we carried out a simulated study from
the integrated cohort via generating 8 virtual microarray
data sets. For each virtual microarray data set, SAM
[37] was applied for gene signatures identification. Gene
expression was considered to be different if the threshold
of false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.05 and fold
change above 1.2.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Microarray selection and metadata
normalization
The raw human microarray transcription tissue
expression profiles were retrieved and downloaded
from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and
Array Express (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/).
Totally, three ccRCC microarray datasets from the
cohorts of Lenburg et al. [24], Gumz et al. [25] and
Cifola et al. [26], that included RCC samples and the
matching normal tissue samples from the same patient,
were downloaded. To avoid the variable biases from
artifacts and non-biological conditions, raw fluorescence
files were normalized using Robust Multichip Average
(RMA) algorithm basing on R environment (http://www
.r-project.org/). To remove the non-biological experiment
variation across different microarray individuals, AILUN
[27] platform comparison (http://ailun.stanford.edu/)
and ArrayMining [28] cross-study integration (http://
www.arraymining.net/) were achieved as our previously
described [29].

RCC regulated network construction
Manually curated human signaling atlas with great
superiority was downloaded from Edwin Wang lab (http://
www.cancer-systemsbiology.org/) which covered data
source from BioCarta, CST signaling pathways, pathways
interaction database (PID), iHOP and even many review
papers from cell signaling [38]. To obtain a related
network regulated by renal cell carcinoma, differently
expressed genes originated from the simulated microarray
metadata were matched into the human cancer protein
interaction network and visualized using Cytoscape (http://
www.cytoscape.org/).

Datasets integration

Signaling pathway enrichment analysis by
ingenuity pathway analysis

As a major challenge for gene signatures
identification, limited sample of clusters prevent the
robustness of cancer biomarkers. Mutated tumor
suppressor buried in the tumor genomes often led to
genomic instability, which in turn resulted in genomic
rearrangements or even chromosomal fragment

All the gene sets regulated by ccRCC were
uploaded to the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis platform
(IPA, Ingenuity System Inc, USA, http://www.ingenuity
.com/) in the context of global canonical pathway. The
p  value was calculated using the right-tailed Fisher
Exact Test.

Cell culture

For Boyden chamber assay, the bottom of the
Transwell membrane was pretreated with Matrigel
(Becton-Dickinson, Bedford, MA, USA) for 4 h.
Afterwards, 5 × 104 cells resuspended in serum-free
r-Hu EPO medium were plated in the upper chamber of
a transwell apparatus (8.0 μm pore, Coaster, Corning, NY,
USA), while 600 μL of RPMI 1640 (786-O) or McCoy’s
5A (Caki-2) medium with 10% FBS were provided in
the lower chamber. After incubation at 37°C for 24 h,
cells in the upper chamber were removed with a cotton
sticker. Cells that migrated to the bottom of the membrane
were attached and fixed, stained with 0.5% crystal violet
and counted using Image Pro Plus software (Media
Cybernetics, Inc., Bethesda, MD).

Two established human renal clear adenocarcinoma
cell lines Caki-2 and 786-O were all purchased from ATCC
(ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA). Cells were maintained in
RPMI 1640 (786-O) or McCoy’s 5A (Caki-2) medium
supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS),
1% (v/v) penicillin and 1% (v/v) streptomycin. Cells were
maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2 and proper humidity.

MTS assay for cell proliferation
To elevate whether r-Hu EPO elicit a negative
proliferative effect towards human ccRCC, cell viability
was determined using MTS (CellTiter 96® Aqueous,
Madison, WI, USA) kit. Caki-2 and 786-O cells were
seeded into the 96-well plates at a density of 2,000 per well
and allowed to adhere using serum-free culture medium.
After 24 h incubation, cells were treated with or without
r-Hu EPO for another 48 h. At the end of incubation,
100 μL of MTS was added to each well and continued
to incubate for 2 h at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2. Finally, to determine the amount of
soluble formazan produced by cellular reduction of MTS,
cells were recorded using a 96-well plate reader (Bio-Rad
Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) at 490 nm.

Whole cell lysates and one-Dimensional
SDS-PAGE separation
786-O Cells with or without r-Hu EPO treatment
were washed with chilled PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer
(50 mm Tric-HCl, (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2 ,
1 mm CaCl2 and 1% Triton X-100) containing protease
inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). The
concentration of whole proteins was determined at 570 nm
using the bicinchoninic acid kit (BCA, Pierce, Rockford, IL,
USA). For one-Dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis, 80 μg of
protein samples were separated using 12% SDS-PAGE gel.
Gel was stained using coomassie blue (0.5% Coomassie
Blue G-250, 30% methanol and 10% acetic acid) for 1 h
and destained in 50% acetonitrile containing 5% acetic acid
until the desired contrast was achieved.

High content screening (HCS) for BrdU
proliferation
The Cellomics BrdU cell proliferation reagent
kits (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) was used
for quantification of DNA replication per our previous
publication [39]. As an alternative to 3H-thymidine,
5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU) enables us to detect
DNA replication in actively proliferating cells using
a monoclonal antibody against BrdU and DyLight
488 fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody.
Moreover, cell number and DNA content were quantified
with DAPI staining. For image acquisition, Caki-2 and
786-O cells were fixed and analyzed using the high
content screening Operetta system (Perkin-Elmer,
Hamburg, Germany).

In-gel digestion, peptide extraction and
separation, and liquid chromatography
LTQ-orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS) analysis
Destained gel was cutted into 10 pieces and
digested overnight with 5 μL trypsin (10 ng/μL) at
37°C. For peptide extraction, the trypsin digestions were
extracted using filter aided sample preparation (FASP)
per the manufacturer’s protocol [40]. The extracted
peptide samples were reconstituted with 600  μL of
20  mM ammonium formate at pH10.0, and directly
injected into a C18 Waters XBridge BEH130 column
(2.1  × 150 mm, Waters, Milford, MA) containing
3.5  μm particles. Peptides separation was performed
in a Liquid Chromatography for gradient elution using
acetonitrile plus 20 mM ammonium formate at a flow
rate of 230 μL/min. As to the MS analysis, peptides were
analyzed by a LTQ-OrbitrapVelos mass spectrometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipping
with a Nanospray Flex Ion Source (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, USA). Full scan MS spectra (m/z 350–2000)
was monitored with a resolution of 60,000 at m/z 400.
Finally, sequence analysis was carried on the Uniprot

Cell migration assays
To test the directional migratory ability of renal
cell carcinoma cells before and after r-Hu EPO treatment,
wound closure assay was performed. Briefly, confluent
Caki-2 or 786-O cells were cultured in serum-depleted
medium for 24 h and scratched with a 200 μL pipette
tip and washed by germfree PBS three times. Wounds
in the present or absent of r-Hu EPO were then imaged
at different intervals with a Nikon Eclipse microscope
(Nikon UK Limited, Kingston Upon Thames, UK).

CC = 2en  / (kn(kn-1))
Where en represents the number of connected pairs

Raw data analysis and differentially expressed
proteins identification

Western blot

Relative protein abundance was calculated using
MaxQuant [42] (http://www.maxquant.org/) and preprocessed using the filter function button in Perseus
platform (version 1.5.2.6, http://www.perseus-framework
.org/). For significantly expressed proteins identification,
two class paired student’s t test was utilized between the
3  r-Hu EPO treated groups and their matched vehicles
with the P value less than 0.001.

Total protein extracted from Caki-2 and 786-O
cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (Biyuntian,
Shanghai, China) and equal amounts of proteins were
separated using 12% SDS-PAGE electronics. Proteins
were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membranes, blocked by 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)
and incubated with a rabbit monoclonal anti- KIAA010
antibody (diluted 1:1,000, Abcam, Cambridge, MA,
USA), a rabbit monoclonal anti- EPOR antibody(diluted
1:2,000, Bioworld Technology, Inc. Minneapolis, MN)
and a rabbit monoclonal anti-GAPDH antibody (diluted
1:10,000, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), followed
be a DyLight 800-conjugated secondary immunoglobulin
G antibody against rabbit (diluted 1:1,000, EarthOx, San
Francisco, CA, USA).

Protein-protein interaction network construction
To infer a reliable PPI network mediated by EPO
in renal cell carcinoma, differently expressed protein
identified by one-Dimensional SDS-PAGE proteomics
were used as seeds to fish out the direct and indirect
interactions from DIP (Database of Interaction Proteins,
http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/dip/Main.cgi),
BIOGRID
(Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets,
http://thebiogrid.org/), HPRD (Human Protein Reference
Database, http://www.hprd.org/), BOND (Bimolecular
Object Network Database, http://bind.ca), MINT
(Molecular Interaction database, http://mint.bio.uniroma2
.it/mint/Welcome.do) and IntAct (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/
intact/) warehouses from the in-house SysBiomics
platform [43].

Immunofluorescence staining
Caki-2 and 786-O cells were allowed to adhere
to WillCo-35-mm confocal dishes (WPI, Sarasota, FL,
Invitrogen) with a glass bottom. 50 IU/mL r-Hu EPO
was added to the dish and cells were incubated for 48 h
at 37°C. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed with
4% pre-warmed formaldehyde for 20 to 30 min at room
temperature, following by permeabilization with 0.1%
Triton X-100. The permeabilized cells were stained
with KIAA0101 (diluted 1:500, Abcam, Cambridge,
MA, USA) and DyLight 488 (diluted 1:1,000, EarthOx,
San  Francisco, CA, USA) antibodies. For image
acquisition, cellular fluorescence was scanned and
monitored with an UltraVIEW VOX Confocal imaging
system (PerkinElmer, Cambridge, UK).

Network optimization, topological calculation
and target identification
For network optimization, the undirected PPI
network was visualized using Cytoscape platform and
Steiner minimal tree algorithm was applied for network
optimization. By applying the NetworkAnalyzer plug- in
[44], all directed and undirected self-loops were removed.
In addition, nodes without connections were deleted
from the network and only the largest component was
considered as the renal cell carcinoma PPI network
mediated by r-Hu EPO.
To calculate the regulatory capacity of each
individual protein regulated by r-Hu EPO, again, the
Cytoscape NetworkAnalyzer package was employed
for topological parameters calculation. Degree (kn), the
number of first links attached to a node that represents
the capacity encoding by other transcription factors, was
used and calculated in the network for neighborhood
connectivity. In addition, we also quantify the structural
properties of the renal cell carcinoma elicited by r-Hu EPO

KIAA0101 protein knockdown
KIAA0101 small interfering RNA (siRNA) and
the negative control siRNA (Scramble) were purchased
from Santa Cruz Inc. (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA). For KIAA0101 protein transient knockdown,
Caki-2 and 786-O cells were co-transfected KIAA0101
siRNA (or scramble siRNA) and siRNA Transfection
Reagent for 12 h. After incubation with culture medium
supplemented with 10% FBS for another 12 h, cells were
lysed and the knockdown efficiency was assessed using
Western Blot.
