ABSTRACT
Until recently, few molecular signatures of drug resistance identified in druginduced resistant cancer cell models can be translated into clinical practice. Here, we
defined differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between pre-chemotherapy colorectal
cancer (CRC) tissue samples of non-responders and responders for 5-fluorouracil and
oxaliplatin-based therapy as clinically relevant drug resistance genes (CRG5-FU/L-OHP).
Taking CRG5-FU/L-OHP as reference, we evaluated the clinical relevance of several types of
genes derived from HCT116 CRC cells with resistance to 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin,
respectively. The results revealed that DEGs between parental and resistant cells,
when both were treated with the corresponding drug for a certain time, were
significantly consistent with the CRG5-FU/L-OHP as well as the DEGs between the postchemotherapy CRC specimens of responders and non-responders. This study suggests
a novel strategy to extract clinically relevant drug resistance genes from both druginduced resistant cell models and post-chemotherapy cancer tissue specimens.

resistant and drug-treated resistant cells [inducible in the
resistant cells (IR) genes]. They considered the pathways
significantly enriched with any of the three types of genes
as drug resistance pathways. Apparently, both IP and IR
genes may mainly represent drug-induced changes, and
their relevance to drug resistance is unclear. Allen et al.
proposed that the overlap between BD genes and IP genes
might represent drug resistance genes [16, 17]. However,
because BD and IP genes represent sustained and transient
drug-induced changes, respectively, their overlaps may still
be irrelevant to drug resistance. Munkácsy et al. proposed
that IP genes should be excluded from BD genes [18].
However, some IP genes could be drug resistance genes,
and it is difficult to determine which IP genes should be
excluded. In contrast to the aforementioned studies, Li et al.
proposed that DEGs between a drug-induced resistant cell
and its parental cell, both of which have undergone drug
treatment for a defined time, might represent targets for

INTRODUCTION
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between
parental and drug–induced resistant cells are frequently
regarded as drug resistance genes [1–6] and used to
identify predictive markers of therapeutic benefit [7–9].
However, findings of such studies can be hardly translated
into clinical practice [10–14]. It has been recognized that
genes identified from drug–induced resistant cell models
may simply represent drug-induced transcriptional
changes that may be irrelevant to resistance mechanisms
[15]. Therefore, alternative experimental approaches have
been proposed.
Stevenson et al. introduced three in vitro gene lists
[9]: (i) DEGs between parental and resistant cells [termed
basally deregulated (BD) genes]; (ii) DEGs between
parental and drug-treated parental cells [inducible in
the parental cells (IP) genes], and (iii) DEGs between

therapies aimed at reversing drug resistance [19]. Here,
we define this type of DEG as inducible difference (ID)
genes, which represent the difference between two cell
types in response to drug treatment. Given this diversity
of definition for candidate drug resistance genes, it is
necessary to evaluate the clinical relevance of various
genes identified in cell models.
Another problem is that, in microarray or RNAsequencing experiments that compare two types of cell
lines, usually only two or three technical replicates are
generated. Because commonly used statistical methods,
such as Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM)
[20] and variation analysis [21], often have insufficient
statistical power when the sample sizes are small [22–24],
the FC method is frequently applied to select DEGs in
such small-scale cell line experiments [25–27]. However,
genes that are highly expressed in both cells can hardly
reach large FCs. Moreover, genes with low expression
levels in both cell types may reach large FCs owing simply
to measurement variations, resulting in false positives
[28]. In contrast, the average difference (AD) method can
identify genes that are highly expressed in both cells and
show large absolute differences, even if the FCs in their
expression levels are small [23, 29]. Notably, genes with
high expression levels are likely to participate in some
biologically conserved pathways, such as metabolism and
membrane trafficking [29, 30] Hence, it is necessary to
leverage its value in detecting drug resistance genes in
small-scale cell line experiments.
In this study, we defined DEGs between prechemotherapy clinical tissue samples of responders and
non-responders for 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin-based
therapy as clinically relevant drug resistance genes
(CRG5-FU/L-OHP). By analyzing the transcriptional profiles
of drug-induced resistant cell models, we showed that
BD genes mainly reflected drug treatment response and
were inconsistent with CRG5-FU/L-OHP. In contrast, ID genes,
especially when selected according to the AD ranking
method, were significantly consistent with CRG5-FU/L-OHP.
We also found that ID genes were significantly consistent
with DEGs between the post-chemotherapy CRC
specimens of responders and non-responders, which
provided compelling evidence for the use of postchemotherapy CRC specimens for identifying genes
relevant to drug resistance.

FC values. The consistency scores (the percentage of genes
that had the same deregulation directions, see Methods)
of BD genes with IP6, IP12 and IP24 were 97.16%, 98.42%
and 98.13%, respectively (binomial test, all P-values
< 1.11E-16, Table 2). When ranking genes by AD, the
corresponding consistency scores were 90.92%, 90.96%
and 86.85% (binomial test, all P-values < 1.11E-16,
Table 1). Similarly, significant consistency between BD
genes and IP6, IP12 and IP24 genes of L-OHP was observed
(binomial test, all P-values < 1.11E-16, Table 1). When
comparing the top-ranked 1500 BD genes and IP genes,
the same results were observed (Supplementary Table 1).
Subsequent analysis of HCT116 SN-38-resistant
cells and doxorubicin-resistant cells from four cancer
types (gastric, pancreatic, colon and breast) in the
GSE3926 dataset revealed similar results (Supplementary
Table 2).

Clinically relevant drug resistance genes
We defined DEGs between pre-chemotherapy tissue
samples of non-responders and responders of CRC patients
treated with 5-FU and L-OHP-based therapy as clinically
relevant drug resistance genes, denoted as CRG5-FU/L-OHP.
The GSE19860 and GSE28702 datasets (Table 1), which
were both generated by the Affymetrix microarray
GPL570 platform, included samples for a total of 25 nonresponders and 19 responders of metastatic CRC patients
treated with mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy, respectively.
We combined the two datasets together to detect 2033
DEGs(FDR < 0.2) using the RankProduct method which
is resistant to experimental batch effects [31]. Then, we
detected 179 DEGs (FDR < 0.2) between the 4 nonresponders and 4 responders of metastatic CRC patients
treated with 5-FU and L-OHP in the E-MEXP-3368
dataset. As the mFOLFOX6 regimen also included 5-FU
and L-OHP, the overlapped genes of the two lists of DEGs
should be CRG5-FU/L-OHP and consistent in deregulation
directions under the assumption that the drugs used
together in each of the chemotherapy regimens have no
or limited antagonistic effects against with each other
(Supplementary Methods). In fact, the two lists of DEGs
had 82 overlapped genes and the consistency score was
79.27% (binomial test, P-value < 5.15E-07). This result
suggested that CRG5-FU/L-OHP could be detected robustly
in the independent datasets. It also provided evidence
for the assumption that the drugs used in combination
had no or limited antagonistic effects against with each
other. Finally, the 315 DEGs detected with FDR < 0.2 in
a dataset and with P-value < 0.05 in another dataset were
treated as the final CRG5-FU/L-OHP (Supplementary Table3).
We additionally analyzed the GSE52735 dataset
which included samples for 14 non-responders and
23 responders of metastatic CRC patients treated with a
combination chemotherapy including fluoropyrimidine
(5-FU and capecitabine, an oral prodrug of 5-FU).

RESULTS
BD genes are significantly consistent with
IP genes
The IP genes were denoted as IP6, IP12 and IP24
for the conditions in which the parental cells underwent
drug treatment for 6, 12 and 24 hours, respectively. In the
E-MEXP-390 dataset (Table 1), we selected the top-ranked
3000 BD genes and the IP genes for 5-FU with the largest

Using the RankProduct method, we detected 1805 DEGs
(FDR < 0.2) between the non-responders and responders
and they overlapped with 167 of the 315 CRG5-FU/L-OHP.
As the three combination chemotherapy regimens shared
5-FU only, the overlapped DEGs should represent
CRG5-FU and consistent in deregulation directions in
the three gene lists (Supplementary Methods). In fact,
the consistency score for the 167 overlapped genes was
78.44% (binomial test, P-value = 7.39E-11). This result
suggested that CRGs for 5-FU could be detected robustly
in independent datasets. The 131 DEGs consistently
detected in the three datasets were defined as the final
CRG5-FU (Supplementary Table4). We used CRG5-FU to
evaluate the clinical relevance of candidate genes derived
from 5-FU resistant cell line models (Figure 1). Due to the
lack of other independent datasets for CRC patients with
L-OHP-based chemotherapy, we treated the CRG5-FU/L-OHP
as the reference to evaluate the clinical relevance of
BD  genes and ID genes of L-OHP (Supplementary
Methods).

were as low as 45% for the DEGs ranked by the FC
method. The score was 64.44% for the DEGs ranked by the
AD method (binomial test, P-value = 3.62E-02, Table 3),
suggesting significant but weak consistency between
BDtwo genes and CRG5-FU/L-OHP. In addition, We evaluated
the clinical relevance of BD genes for each single drug.
The corresponding consistency scores between the topranked 3000 BD genes of 5-FU and CRG5-FU/L-OHP were
51.35% for the FC method and 68.57% for the AD method
(Table 3). Similar results were observed when the CRG5-FU
were used as the reference to evaluate the clinical
relevance of BD genes for 5-FU (Supplementary Table 6).
For L-OHP, no significant consistency was observed
between BD genes and CRG5-FU/L-OHP when ranking genes
by either FC or AD (Table 3). For other CRC L-OHPresistant cell lines (DLD1, HT29, LS513 and Lovo) in
the GSE10405 dataset, no significant consistency was
observed between BD genes and CRG5-FU/L-OHP (Table 3).
Similar results were observed when analyzing the
top-ranked 1500 BDtwo and BD genes ranked by FC or AD
(Supplementary Table 7). These results suggest that the
clinical relevance of BD genes is poor.

Clinical relevance of BD genes
We defined BDtwo genes as those found in the
overlap between the top-ranked 3000 BD genes of 5-FU
and L-OHP, which had the same deregulation directions

(binomial test, P-value = 2.85E-06) and 72.15% (binomial
test, P-value = 5.13E-05, Table 3), respectively. Similar
results were observed when the CRG5-FU were used as the
reference to evaluate the clinical relevance of ID genes for
5-FU (Supplementary Table 6). With regard to L-OHP, no
significant consistency was observed for either ID6 or ID12
genes when ranking genes by either FC or AD (Table 3).
For ID24 genes, however, the corresponding consistency
scores were 74.65% when ranked by FC (binomial
test, P-value = 1.94E-05) and 83.10% by AD (binomial
test, P-value = 6.74E-09, Table 3). Similar results were
observed when analyzing the top-ranked 1500 ID genes
(Supplementary Table 7).
Additionally, we applied two-way analysis of
variance to identify ID genes. The numbers of ID genes for
L-OHP and 5-FU were 269 and 361 (P-value < 5.00E-02),
respectively, and they overlapped with only 6 and 3 of
CRG5-FU/L-OHP, respectively, due to the limited efficiency of
variance estimation [22].
We found that the IDtwo-24 genes, BD genes
of 5-FU and ID24 genes of 5-FU detected by the

parental cell lines also treated with 5-FU or L-OHP
(Supplementary Table 5). The IDtwo genes were further
denoted as IDtwo-6, IDtwo-12 and IDtwo-24 for the conditions
where cells underwent drug treatment for 6, 12, and 24 hours,
respectively. We then evaluated the clinical relevance of these
genes. No significant consistency was observed for IDtwo-6
and IDtwo-12 genes when ranking genes either by FC or AD
(Table 3). For IDtwo-24 genes, however, the consistency score
was as high as 84.21% when ranking genes by AD (binomial
test, P-value=1.22E-05). The score was also as high as
70% when ranking genes by FC, although it did not reach
significance. Similar results were observed when analyzing
the top-ranked 1500 IDtwo genes (Supplementary Table7).
We further evaluated the clinical relevance of the
top-ranked 3000 ID genes of 5-FU. When ranking genes
by FC, only ID12 genes were significantly consistent with
CRG5-FU/L-OHP, with a corresponding consistency score
of 77.65% (binomial test, P-value = 1.52E-07, Table 3).
When ranking genes by AD, however, significant
consistency was observed for both ID12 and ID24 genes
and the corresponding consistency scores were 74.16%

AD method were more significantly consistent with
CRG5-FU/L-OHP compared with the FC method (Table 3).
With regard to the IDtwo-24 genes, there were 35 genes
detected by AD but not FC. The average expression
levels of these genes in parental cells treated with 5-FU
for 24 hours and 5-FU-resistant cells treated with 5-FU
for 24 hours were 1992.72 and 2322.72 (Figure  2A,
Supplementary Table  8). The consistency score of
these genes with CRG5-FU/L-OHP was 82.86% (binomial
test, P-value = 5.84E-05, Supplementary Table  8). By
contrast, 7 genes detected by FC but not AD tended to
have low expression levels and the corresponding average
expression levels were 212.93 and 238.03 (Figure 2A,
Supplementary Table 8). The corresponding consistency
score was 57.14% (Supplementary Table 8). A similar
result was also observed in L-OHP-resistant cells
(Figure 2B, Supplementary Table 4). Subsequent analysis
of BD genes of 5-FU and ID24 genes of 5-FU revealed
similar results (Figure 2C–2D, Supplementary Table 8).
These results demonstrate that AD is biased toward the
identification of genes expressing at higher levels, whereas
FC is biased at lower levels. Genes with low expression

levels in both cell lines may reach large FCs simply due
to measurement variations that create false positives [32].
It is worth noting that IDtwo-24 and ID24 genes
of both 5-FU and L-OHP had significant consistency
with CRG5-FU/L-OHP while no significant consistency
was observed in IDtwo-6 and ID6 genes (Table 2). We
combined ID24 genes detected by FC or AD method,
which were significantly consistent with CRG5-FU/L-OHP,
resulting in 70 genes of 5-FU resistance and 65 genes
of L-OHP resistance (Supplementary Table 9). The log2
FC values and AD values of these genes are shown in
Figure 3A–3D. We found that resistant genes of both
5-FU and L-OHP tended to change abruptly before the
24-hour time point. This result indicates that transient
changes in expression levels might be unstable when the
drug treatment time is short. It has been reported that
many of the genes obtained above correlate with drug
resistance, as exemplified in Supplementary Table  10
for the top 20 ID24 genes ranked by AD method for
each of the two drugs. TYMS is target of 5-FU and its
overexpression can induce 5-FU resistance [33]. UNG
can initiate base excision repair and its overexpression

and increases chemoresistance of colon cancer cells
to L-OHP [35]. TTK, MCM2, CLDN7 and TSPAN13

could stimulate drug resistance [36–39].

Pathway analysis of ID24 genes
Functional enrichment analysis showed that the top
3000 ID24 genes of 5-FU separately ranked by FC and
AD were enriched in 6 and 22 pathways, respectively
(FDR  <  0.1, Supplementary Table 11). With regard to
L-OHP, the top 3000 ID24 genes separately ranked by FC
and AD were enriched in 14 and 31 pathways, respectively
(FDR <0.1, Supplementary Table 11). It has been reported
that many of the pathways enriched with ID24 genes
could mediate drug resistance of the corresponding
drug, as described in the Supplementary Table 11. Genes
detected by the AD method but not FC were significantly
enriched mostly in more conserved pathways with
important biological significance, including glycolysis/
gluconeogenesis, citrate cycle (TCA cycle), fatty acid

Identification of ID genes based on
post-chemotherapy CRC specimens
We denoted IDclinical genes as DEGs between the postchemotherapy CRC specimens of responders and non–
responders, which are similar to ID genes that represent
the difference between two cell types in response to drug
treatment. Using the RankProduct method, we detected
1725 IDclinical genes (FDR < 0.1), with the consistency score
between IDclinical genes and CRG5-FU/L-OHP (CRG5-FU) as high
as 83.85% (88.46%) (binomial test, P-value < 1.11E-16,
Supplementary Table 13). Furthermore, the consistency
score between IDclinical genes and the top-ranked 3000

IDtwo-24 detected by the AD method was 73.57% (binomial
test, P-value < 1.09E-08, Supplementary Table 13). Both
IDtwo-24 and ID24 genes were substantially more consistent
with IDclinical genes than IDtwo-6, IDtwo-12, ID6, and ID12
(Supplementary Table 13). Similar results were observed
when analyzing the top-ranked 1500 ID genes ranked
by FC or AD (Supplementary Table 13). In addition, the
IDtwo-24 genes detected by the AD method were also more
significantly consistent with IDclinical genes compared with
the FC method (Supplementary Table 8, Figure 2E–2F).

supporting the notion that the two type genes might be
largely consistent [52, 53].
In summary, this pilot study on CRC suggests a
novel experimental analysis strategy to extract clinically
relevant drug-resistance signatures from drug-induced
resistant cell models. It also suggests that tumor tissue
samples taken at definitive surgery after chemotherapy
could be useful for identifying drug-resistance signatures.

DISCUSSION

Data acquisition and processing

Current cancer therapeutics are generally dosed in
combination [42, 43]. This makes it difficult to directly
study drug resistance mechanisms for any single drug in
clinical cohorts. Thus, using cell models would be the only
practical choice for identifying resistant signatures for
individual drugs [7, 44–46] although the clinical relevance
of cancer cell models has been continuously questioned
[10–14]. Our results demonstrated that, rather than BD
genes, ID genes which represented the difference between
parental and resistant cells in response to drug treatment
would be more likely to be involved in drug resistance.
Moreover, our analysis supports that samples taken after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be used to ascertain
functional drug resistance signatures [47, 48].
One caveat of our analysis for identifying ID genes
is that expression profiles of drug-treated cells were
only measured at 6, 12, and 24 hours, which might be
insufficient to investigate the characteristics of sustained
responses [49, 50]. It would be possible that the difference
between two types of cell in sustained response to drug
treatment might be more likely relevant with drug
resistance. Hence, it is necessary to design experiments
with prolonged time of drug treatment and to further
characterize the dynamic transcriptome change. Another
problem is that many factors such as the choice of a parent
cell line, drug dose and treatment interval are associated
with the drug resistance level of the drug-induced resistant
cell [51]. A reasonable assumption would be that using cell
models with higher level of drug resistance might have
larger chance to find drug resistance genes, which deserves
our future study. The third problem is that the CRGs
identified from pre-chemotherapy specimens represent
inherent resistance genes, whereas the process of inducing
a drug sensitive cell to become a drug resistant cell by
drug treatment might mimic the process of acquiring
drug resistance for clinical patients during chemotherapy.
However, it has been suggested that there might be no
obvious boundaries between inherent drug resistance
genes and acquired drug resistance genes [52, 53]. In
fact, the significant consistency between the ID genes and
the corresponding CRGs could be regarded as evidence

The transcriptional profiles of 30 postchemotherapy CRC specimens were submitted to
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession
number GSE69657. All patients underwent neoadjuvant
FOLFOX4 chemotherapy, and there were 13 responders
and 17 non-responders according to the Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) [54].
The detailed experimental protocols were described in
a previous study [55]. All other datasets analyzed in this
study were downloaded from GEO and ArrayExpress
(Table 1). The datasets generated from the Affymetrix
microarray platform were pre-processed using the
robust microarray average (RMA) algorithm and the
other datasets generated from the Illumina and Agilent
microarray platform were log2-transformed and
quantile normalized. Normalization of GSE10405 was
performed with Lowess and Dye Swap Sim Fix Filter
methods [56]. Each probe-set ID was mapped to its
Entrez gene ID. If multiple probe-sets were mapped to
the same gene, the expression value for the gene was
defined as the arithmetic mean of the values of the
multiple probe-sets.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Reproducibility evaluation of DEGs from
independent datasets
For DEGs from two independent datasets, sharing
k DEGs, of which s genes had the same deregulation
directions (both up-regulated or down-regulated in the two
gene lists), the consistency score was calculated as s/k.
The probability of observing at least s of k DEGs with the
same deregulation directions by chance can be evaluated
using the cumulative binomial distribution model as
follows:
s−1
k
p = 1 − a a b 1 pe 2 i 1 1 − pe 2 k−i	(1)
i=0 i

where pe is the probability of one gene having the
same deregulation directions in two gene lists by random
chance (here, pe=0.5).

We have made a strict mathematical derivation to
prove that if two different regimens share one or several
drugs, then the overlaps of CRGs for the two different
regimens should be the CRGs for the shared drug(s) under
the assumption that the drugs used in combination had no
(or limited) antagonistic effects(Supplementary Methods).
The RankProduct method [31], which is resistant to batch
effects, was applied to identify DEGs between responders
and non–responders. Using 52 samples collected from
three independent datasets (Table 1), we selected and
evaluated the reproducibility of the CRG5-FU/L-OHP. The
GSE52735 dataset including 37 samples was used to
select the CRG5-FU. The p-values were adjusted using the
Benjamini and Hochberg procedure [57].
