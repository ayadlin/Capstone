Summary

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We analyzed proteomes of colon and rectal tumors previously characterized by the Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) and performed integrated proteogenomic analyses. Somatic variants
displayed reduced protein abundance compared to germline variants. mRNA transcript abundance
did not reliably predict protein abundance differences between tumors. Proteomics identified five
proteomic subtypes in the TCGA cohort, two of which overlapped with the TCGA “MSI/CIMP”
transcriptomic subtype, but had distinct mutation, methylation, and protein expression patterns
associated with different clinical outcomes. Although copy number alterations showed strong cisand trans-effects on mRNA abundance, relatively few of these extend to the protein level. Thus,
proteomics data enabled prioritization of candidate driver genes. The chromosome 20q amplicon
was associated with the largest global changes at both mRNA and protein levels; proteomics data
highlighted potential 20q candidates including HNF4A, TOMM34 and SRC. Integrated
proteogenomic analysis provides functional context to interpret genomic abnormalities and affords
a new paradigm for understanding cancer biology.

Introduction

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has characterized the genomic features of human
cancers1–6 and thereby presents the challenge of explaining how genomic alterations drive
cancers7. Because proteins link genotypes to phenotypes, the Clinical Proteomic Tumor
Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) is performing proteomic analyses of TCGA tumor
specimens for selected cancer types. Here we present the first integrated proteogenomic
characterization of human cancer with an analysis of the TCGA colorectal cancer (CRC)
specimens6.
The TCGA study affirmed well-established genomic features of CRC and described three
transcriptional subtypes, 17 chromosomal regions of significant focal amplification and 28
regions of significant focal deletion, and linked genomic features of CRC to critical
signaling pathways. The drivers underlying copy number alterations (CNAs) and
transcriptional subtypes are largely unknown, and an integrative analysis of both genomic
and proteomic data may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the information
flow from DNA to protein to phenotype.

Identification of peptides, proteins and variant sequences

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We performed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based
shotgun proteomic analyses on 95 TCGA tumor samples (Extended Data Fig. 1,
Supplementary Methods 1–4), the clinical and pathological characteristics and TCGA
datasets for which are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Benchmark quality control
(QC) samples from one basal and one luminal human breast tumor xenograft were analyzed
in alternating order after every five CRC samples (Supplementary Methods 2).
We identified a total of 124,823 distinct peptides among the 95 samples, corresponding to
6,299,756 spectra in an assembly of 7,526 protein groups with a protein-level False
Discovery Rate (FDR) of 2.64% (Supplementary Methods 5.1–5.2, Extended Data Fig. 2).
To facilitate integration between genomic and proteomic data, a gene-level assembly of the
peptides identified 7,211 genes.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A fundamental question in proteogenomics is which protein coding alterations are expressed
at the protein level. Because standard database search approaches cannot identify variant
pe3ptides from MS/MS data, we also performed database searches with customized
sequence databases from matched RNA-Seq data for individual samples8, 9 (Supplementary
Methods 5.3, Extended Data Fig. 3).
We identified 796 single amino acid variants (SAAVs) across all 86 tumors for which
matched RNA-Seq data was available (Fig. 1a–b, Supplementary Table 2–3), among which
64 corresponded to somatic variants reported by TCGA and 101 were reported in the
COSMIC database (i.e. COSMIC-supported variants). Of the remaining SAAVs, 526 were
listed in the dbSNP database (i.e. dbSNP-supported variants) and are likely to be germline
variants. The 162 previously unreported SAAVs might be explained by novel somatic or
germline variants, RNA editing, or, in some cases, false discovery.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The identified somatic variants were clearly enriched in the hypermutated samples, whereas
the germline variants showed no association with hypermutation (Fig. 1a). Although 58% of
the germline variants occurred in two or more samples, almost all somatic variants occurred
in only one sample (Fig. 1c). The low identification rate for somatic variants may reflect
relatively low sequence coverage in shotgun proteomics; however, somatic variants also
might negatively impact protein abundance, possibly by reducing translational efficiency or
protein stability10. Using the protein abundance quantification method described below and
detailed in Supplementary Methods 5.4, we found that somatic variants exerted a
significantly stronger negative impact on protein abundance than did dbSNP-supported
variants (p<2.2 × 10-16, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, Fig. 1d, Supplementary Methods
5.5). The percentage of variants with an impact score of less than −2 was doubled for
somatic variants compared to dbSNP-supported variants (p<2.2 × 10-16, Chi-squared test,
Fig. 1d).
Cancer-related variant proteins may serve as candidate protein biomarkers or therapeutic
targets. The 108 somatic or COSMIC-supported protein variants mapped to 105 genes,
including known cancer genes in the Cancer Gene Census database such as KRAS, CTNNB1,
SF3B1, ALDH2, and FH. The list also included 14 targets of FDA-approved drugs or drugs

in clinical trials4, such as ALDH2, HSD17B4, PARP1, P4HB, TST, GAK, SLC25A24, and
SUPT16H. A subset of variant peptide sequences, including K-ras (G12D) were verified by
targeted analyses of tumor lysates spiked with synthetic, isotope-labeled peptide standards
(Supplementary Methods 6). One example is shown in Extended Data Fig. 4.
Quantification of protein abundance
To quantify protein abundance, we used spectral counts, which are the total number of
MS/MS spectra acquired for peptides from a given protein11 (Supplementary Methods 5.4,
Supplementary Table 4). Analysis of data from benchmark QC samples demonstrated
platform reproducibility throughout the analyses and enabled evaluation of data
normalization methods (Extended Data Fig. 5a–b). Based on the minimal spectral count
requirement established using the QC data set (Extended Data Fig. 5c), 3,899 genes with a
protein-level FDR of 0.43% were used to compare relative protein abundance across tumor
samples.
mRNA abundance does not reliably predict protein abundance

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The matched proteomic and RNA-Seq measurements from the TCGA CRC tumors allowed
the first global analysis of transcript-protein relationships in a large human tumor cohort
(Supplementary Methods 7). First, we compared the steady state mRNA and protein
abundance for each gene within individual samples (Supplementary Methods 7.2–7.3,
Extended Data Fig. 6a). All samples showed significant positive mRNA-protein correlation
(multiple-test adjusted p value < 0.01, Spearman’s correlation coefficient) and the average
correlation between steady state mRNA and protein abundance in individual samples was
0.47 (Fig. 2a), which is comparable to previous reports in multi-cellular organisms12.
Next, we examined the concordance between mRNA and protein variation of individual
genes across the 87 tumors for which 3,764 genes had both mRNA and protein
measurements suitable for relative abundance comparison (Supplementary Methods 7.2,
7.4). Although 89% of the genes showed a positive mRNA-protein correlation, only 32%
had statistically significant correlations (Fig. 2b). The average Spearman’s correlation
between mRNA and protein variation was 0.23, which was comparable to reported values
for yeast, mouse and human cell lines13–15.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To test whether the concordance between protein and mRNA variation is related to the
biological function of the gene product, we performed KEGG enrichment analysis
(Supplementary Methods 7.5, Supplementary Table 5). Genes involved in several metabolic
processes showed concordant mRNA and protein variation, whereas other gene classes
showed low or even negative concordance in mRNA and protein variation (Figure 2c). We
also found that genes with stable mRNA and stable protein tend to have higher mRNAprotein correlation than those with unstable mRNA and unstable protein (p = 5.27 × 10-6,
two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Supplementary Methods 7.6, Extended Data Fig. 6b).
mRNA measurements thus are poor predictors of protein abundance variations and both
biological functions of the gene products and mRNA and protein stability may govern
mRNA-protein correlation.

Impact of copy number alterations on mRNA and protein abundance

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The TCGA study identified 17 regions of significant focal amplification and 28 regions of
significant focal deletion. We examined the impact of CNAs on mRNA and protein
abundance, including both cis-effects on the abundance of genes in the same loci and transeffects on the abundance of genes at other loci in the genome (Supplementary Methods 8).
For all 23,125 genes with a CNA measurement in the TCGA data set, we calculated
Spearman’s correlation with mRNA and protein abundance, respectively for the 3,764 genes
with both mRNA and protein measurements (Supplementary Methods 8.1). Examination of
the matrix visualizing significant CNA-mRNA correlations (multiple-test adjusted p value <
0.01) revealed strong positive correlations along the diagonal (Fig. 3a), suggesting strong
cis-effects of CNAs on mRNA abundance. Most of the diagonal signals corresponded to
previously reported arm-level changes6. In contrast, the diagonal pattern was much weaker
for CNA-protein correlations (Fig. 3b).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further investigate the cis-effects of CNAs, we separated all genes with CNA, mRNA,
and protein measurements into those in focal amplification regions, focal deletion regions,
and non-focal regions (i.e., chromosomal regions without focal amplification or deletion).
As shown in Extended Data Figure 7, CNA-mRNA correlations were significantly higher
than CNA-protein correlations for genes in all three groups (p<1.0 × 10-10, KS test).
Moreover, genes in the focal amplification regions showed significantly higher CNA-mRNA
and CNA-protein correlations than genes in the non-focal regions (p=4.4 × 10-4 and 0.02,
respectively, KS test). However, the same trend was not observed for genes in the focal
deletion regions. Therefore, focal amplifications have the strongest cis-effects on both
mRNA and protein abundance, suggesting that selection for high protein abundance may
drive CNA in regions of focal amplification. On the other hand, many CNA-driven mRNA
level increases do not translate into increased abundance of the corresponding proteins.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Figure 3a–b also revealed multiple trans-acting CNA hot spots, defined as chromosomal loci
whose amplification is significantly associated with abundance changes of many transcripts
or proteins at other loci. Chromosomes 20q, 18, 16, 13 and 7 contained the five strongest hot
spots driving global mRNA abundance variation. These hot spots also were strongest at the
protein level. Most hot spot-related transcript changes did not propagate to the protein level,
presumably reflecting buffering of protein abundance by post-transcriptional
regulation16, 17. Notably, many hot spot-associated protein level alterations occurred in the
absence of corresponding mRNA alterations, suggesting that the same trans-acting hot spot
may exert independent effects at both the transcriptome and proteome levels.
The 20q amplification was associated with the largest global changes in both mRNA and
protein levels in this univariate analysis. The same conclusion was reached with a
regularized multivariate regression analysis method, remMap18 (Supplementary Methods
8.2, Supplementary Table 6–9). These data highlight the importance of 20q amplification in
CRC, which has not been well documented in previous studies. Among the 79 genes in the
20q region with quantifiable protein measurements, 67 (85%) showed significant CNAmRNA correlation, but only 40 (51%) showed significant CNA-protein correlation

(multiple-test adjusted p value < 0.01, Spearman’s correlation coefficient, Supplementary
Table 10).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Because significant CNA-protein correlations identify amplified sequences that translate to
high protein abundance, proteomic measurements can help prioritize genes in amplified
regions for further examination. Of particular interest among the 40 genes is HNF4A (Fig.
3c), a candidate driver gene nominated by TCGA for the 20q13.12 focal amplification
peak6. HNF4α is a transcription factor with a key role in normal gastrointestinal
development19 and is increasingly being linked to CRC20. However, there are contradictory
reports on whether HNF4α acts as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor gene in CRC20. Upon
reanalysis of the HNF4A shRNA knockdown data for CRC cell lines from the Achilles
project21, we found that the dependency of CRC cells on HNF4α correlated significantly
with the amplification level of HNF4A (Supplementary Methods 8.3, Extended Data Fig. 8),
which may partially explain the contradictory roles reported for HNF4α in CRC. Other
interesting candidates included TOMM34 (Fig. 3d), which is over-expressed frequently in
CRC tumors and is involved in the growth of CRC cells22, and SRC (Fig. 3e), which
encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase implicated in several human cancers including
CRC23.

Proteomic subtypes of CRC
The TCGA study reported three transcriptomic subtypes of CRC, designated “MSI/CIMP”
(microsatellite instability/CpG island methylator phenotype), “Invasive”, and “CIN”
(chromosomal instability). Given the limited correlation between mRNA and protein levels,
we asked whether CRC subtypes can be better represented with proteomics data. Using the
Consensus Clustering24 method (Supplementary Methods 9.1–9.2, Extended Data Fig. 9),
we identified five major proteomic subtypes in this tumor cohort, with 15, 9, 25, 11, and 19
cases in subtypes A through E, respectively (Fig. 4a–b).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We tested the association between the subtype classification and established genomic and
epigenomic features of CRC using Fisher’s exact test (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Table 11).
Almost all hypermutated and MSI-high tumors were included in subtypes B and C, as well
as tumors with POLE and BRAF mutations. However, statistically significant association
with these features was only observed for subtype B (multiple-test adjusted p value < 0.05).
Moreover, whereas subtype B was significantly associated with the TCGA CIMP-H (CIMPhigh) methylation subtype, subtype C was significantly associated with a non-CIMP subtype
(cluster 4). Another unique feature of subtype B was the lack of TP53 mutations and
chromosome 18q loss. These results clearly established the association between proteomic
subtype B and MSI-High and CIMP, but suggest that subtype C might have different
biological underpinnings.
The remaining three subtypes were associated with CIN, another well-accepted genetic
property of CRC. In particular, subtype E was significantly associated with both TP53
mutations and 18q loss, genomic features frequently associated with CIN tumors25.
Interestingly, subtype E was also associated with HNF4A amplification and relatively higher
abundance of HNF4α protein (Fig. 4d). HNF4α abundance was significantly higher in
subtype E tumors compared to normal colon samples (multiple-test adjusted p value = 1.09

× 10-6, two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test); however, significant up-regulation of HNF4α
was not observed for other subtypes (Supplementary Methods 10). This result, together with
our reanalysis of shRNA knockdown data from the Achilles project (Extended Data Fig. 8),
suggest that HNF4α dependency might be particularly associated with the subset of tumors
or cells with HNF4A amplification.
We also examined the association between the subtype classification and clinical features
and found only that stage II tumors were significantly enriched in subtype C (multiple-test
adjusted p value < 0.05, Supplementary Table 11). Supervised statistical analyses at the
individual protein level for 13 clinical and genomic features also identified few, if any
significant protein effects of these features, except for hypermutation status, MSI status, and
18q loss (Supplementary Table 12), suggesting that the proteomic subtypes identified by the
unsupervised clustering analysis captured the major proteome variations across the tumors.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Next, we compared the proteomic subtype classification with the TCGA transcriptional
subtype classification for the 62 samples that had both subtype labels. Proteomic subtypes B
and C both showed significant association with the TCGA subtype “MSI/CIMP” (Fig. 4b,
Supplementary Table 11); however, they differ considerably at genomic, epigenomic, and
proteomic levels (Fig. 4b). We also examined alternative classifications of the TCGA
samples based on two recently published transcriptomic subtype classifiers26, 27. Proteomic
subtype C, but not subtype B, showed enriched overlap with the “Stem-like” subtype
described by Sadanandam et al.27 and the “CCS3” subtype described by De Sousa et al.26.
Interestingly, tumors with “Stem-like” and “CCS3” classifications both have poor prognosis,
which suggests that proteome subtype C also may be associated with poor prognosis.
Therefore, the ability to distinguish subtype B from C through proteomics data is important,
because MSI-High tumors typically have better prognosis25.
Protein signatures and networks associated with proteomic subtypes

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To better understand the biology underlying the proteomic subtypes, we identified protein
signatures for each subtype by supervised comparison of protein abundance in that subtype
against all others; we also required signature proteins for a subtype to be significantly
different in abundance compared to normal colon samples from 30 individuals analyzed on
the same proteome analysis platform (Supplementary Methods 10, Supplementary Table 13–
14). As shown in Extended Data Figure 10a, all CRC subtypes displayed more than 2,000
(>60%) significant protein abundance differences compared to normal colon. Although a
full validation of the proteomic subtypes and protein signatures for the subtypes will require
proteomic profiling data from an independent tumor cohort, a low cross-validation error rate
of 3.8% demonstrated good generalizability of the subtypes and their signature proteins
(Supplementary Methods 11).
We performed Gene Ontology enrichment analysis for the subtype signatures using
WebGestalt28 (Supplementary Methods 11, Supplementary Table 15). Genes involved in
“response to wounding” were significantly enriched in the up-signature of subtype C
(multiple-test adjusted p value < 2.2 × 10-16, Fisher’s exact test). The wound-response gene
signature is a powerful predictor of poor clinical outcome in patients with early stage breast
cancers29. This result further links our subtype C to poor prognosis.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To better understand the functional networks underlying this subtype with potential clinical
importance, we uploaded the up- and down-signatures of subtype C to NetGestalt30 for
enriched protein-protein interaction network module analysis. Four network modules were
enriched with genes in the up-signature for subtype C, whereas two modules were enriched
with genes in the down-signature (multiple-test adjusted p value < 0.01, Fisher’s exact test,
Extended Data Fig. 10b). Notably, the down-signature enriched module (III) included the Ecadherin (CDH1)-β-catenin (CTNNB1)-α-catenin (CTNNA1) complex (Extended Data Fig.
10c, 10e). E-cadherin, the most under-expressed protein in the sub-network, suppresses
invasion in lobular breast carcinoma31 and is a switch for the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), which is associated with poor prognosis in colon cancer32. Other
components of the module were desmosomal proteins (PKP2, JUP and DSG2) and
cytokeratins (KRT18, KRT6A and KRT8). Reduction in both desmosome formation and
cytokeratin expression is associated with EMT33. Moreover, proteins in the most
significantly up-regulated network module (Extended Data Fig. 10d, 10f) included collagens
(COL1A1 and COL3A1) and extracellular matrix glycoproteins (FN1, BGN, FBN1, and
FBN2) that also are markers of EMT34, 35. These data strengthen the association of subtype
C with poor prognosis and relate it to EMT activation.

Discussion
Our proteomic characterization of the genomically-annotated TCGA colon tumors illustrates
the power of integrated proteogenomic analysis. The data demonstrate that protein
abundance cannot be reliably predicted from DNA or RNA-level measurements. mRNA and
protein levels were modestly correlated, as earlier cell and animal model studies suggest36,
but over two thirds of these correlations were not statistically significant in the TCGA tumor
set. Although most CNAs in CRC drive mRNA abundance changes, relatively few
translated to consistent changes in protein abundance.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Genomic and proteomic technologies provide reinforcing data. RNA-Seq data facilitates the
discovery of variant proteins, which could serve as possible biomarker candidates or
therapeutic targets. Combined mRNA and protein profiling data can identify potentially
relevant genes in amplified chromosomal regions. This approach, which revealed the
importance of chromosome 20q amplification and provided new insights into the role of
HNF4α in CRC, can be broadly extended to understand roles of CNAs in other cancers.
Proteomics identified CRC subtypes similar to those detectable by transcriptome profiles,
but further captured features not detectable in transcript profiles. The separation of the
TCGA “MSI/CIMP” subtype into distinct proteotypes illustrates the unique potential of
proteomics-based subtyping. After validation in independent cohorts, protein subtype
signatures could be directly translated into laboratory tests for tumor classification.
Integrated proteogenomic analysis, as demonstrated in this study, will enable new advances
in cancer biology, diagnostics and therapeutics.

Methods Summary
All tumor samples for the current study were obtained through the TCGA Biospecimen Core
Resource (BCR) as described previously6. No other selection criteria other than availability

were applied for this study. Patient-derived xenograft tumors from established Basal and
Luminal-B breast cancer intrinsic subtypes 37, 38 were raised subcutaneously in 8 week old
NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ mice (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, Maine) as previously
described39, 40. Normal colon biopsies were obtained from screening colonoscopies
performed between July 2006 and October 2010 under Vanderbilt University IRB approval
#061096.
Tissue proteins were extracted and tryptic peptide digests were analyzed by
multidimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Xenograft QC samples
were run after every 5 colorectal tumor samples. Raw data were processed for peptide
identification by database and spectral library searching and identified peptides were
assembled as proteins and mapped to gene identifiers for proteogenomic comparisons.
Quantitative proteomic comparisons were based on spectral count data. Detailed
descriptions of the samples, LC-MS/MS analysis, and data analysis methods can be found in
Supplementary Methods. All of the primary mass spectrometry data on TCGA tumor
samples are deposited at the CPTAC Data Coordinating Center as raw and mzML files and
complete protein assembly datasets for public access (https://cptac-dataportal.georgetown.edu).

Extended Data Figure 2. Relaxing the false discovery rate (FDR) of peptide-spectrum match
(PSM) for high-confident proteins increases spectral counts

To increase spectral counts and improve statistical comparisons, we first created a protein
assembly that maximized the number of proteins identified (at 0.1% PSM FDR) and then
relaxed the PSM FDR to 1% exclusively for the set of confidently identified proteins. This
strategy led to increased spectral counts from 4,896,831 to 6,299,756, a 29% increase. a,
Spectral count plot of all 7,526 confidently identified proteins demonstrates the increase in

samples were selected for validation. The TCGA samples were freshly prepared in the same
manner as the original samples analyzed by shotgun proteomics. Each sample was spiked
with 12.5 fmol/μL of a mixture of all isotopically labeled peptides. Using an inclusion list

y-axes representing quantile-normalized spectral counts for samples in corresponding
columns and rows, respectively. The upper-right half (red colored) depicts pair-wise
Spearman’s correlation coefficients for the same comparisons. b, For each normalization
method (none, global, quantile, and NSAF), we calculated the intraclass correlation
coefficients (ICCs) for individual proteins in the QC data set. The analysis was done for the
top 1000, 500, or 100 proteins with the largest variance and the cumulative fraction curves
were plotted. In most scenarios, quantile normalization generated slightly higher ICC scores
than global normalization, and both methods clearly outperformed the NSAF normalization.
c, We sorted all proteins in the QC data set based on their total spectral counts and then
divided the proteins into 10 bins with equal number of proteins. Average spectral count
ranges for each bin are shown in the brackets in the legend box. For each bin, we calculated
the ICCs for individual proteins in the bin. The analysis was done for the top 300, 200, or
100 proteins with the largest variance in each bin. The cumulative fraction curves were
plotted. Protein bins with spectral counts less than 1.4 showed clearly lower ICC scores,
whereas the ICC score curves started to converge when the average spectral count was
greater than 1.4.

a, Evaluation of the length-bias in different RNA-Seq-based gene abundance estimation
methods. The plot shows the distribution of correlation between gene length and estimated
transcript abundance based on FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million

measure strongly correlates with gene length. b, Relationship between mRNA-protein
correlation and the stability of the molecules. Human genes were separated into four
categories based on the mRNA and protein half-lives of their mouse orthologs: stable
mRNA/stable protein; stable mRNA/unstable protein, unstable mRNA/stable protein, and
unstable mRNA/unstable protein. Distribution of mRNA-protein correlations for genes in
each category was plotted in the box plots. Genes with stable mRNA and stable protein

showed relatively higher mRNA-protein correlation whereas those with unstable mRNA and
unstable protein showed relatively lower mRNA-protein correlation. Only common genes in
both our study and the mouse study were included in the analysis. The total number of genes
in each category (N) is labeled in the figure. The p value indicating correlation difference
among the four categories was calculated based on the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric
ANOVA test. The p value indicating correlation difference between the stable mRNA/stable
protein group and the unstable mRNA/unstable protein group was calculated based on the
two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

deletion regions (green), and non-focal regions (blue), respectively. Focal amplification
regions were defined in the TCGA study. Any chromosomal regions outside the focal
amplification and deletion regions were considered as non-focal regions. CNA-mRNA
correlations were significantly higher than CNA-protein correlations for genes in any of the
three groups. Moreover, genes in the focal amplification regions showed the highest level of
CNA-mRNA and CNA-protein correlations among the three groups of genes. P values were
based on the two-sided kolmogorov-smirnov test.

(CDF) plot and core sample identification

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

a, Consensus matrices of the 90 CRC samples for k = 2 to k = 8. The consensus matrices
show the robustness of the discovered clusters to sampling variability (resampling 80%
samples) for cluster numbers k = 2 to 8. In each consensus matrix, both the rows and the
columns were indexed with the same sample order and samples belonging to the same
cluster frequently are adjacent to each other. For each pair of samples, a consensus index,
which is the percentage of times they belong to the same cluster during 1,000 runs of the
clustering algorithm based on resampling was calculated. The consensus index for each pair
of samples was represented by color gradient from white (0%) to red (100%) in the
consensus matrix. b, CDF plots corresponding to the consensus matrices for k = 2 to k = 8.
This plot shows the cumulative distribution of the entries of the consensus matrices within
the 0–1 range. Skew toward 0 and 1 indicates good clustering. As k increases, the area under
the CDF is hypothesized to increase markedly until k reaches the ktrue. In this case, 7 was
considered as ktrue because the change of the area under the CDF was close to zero when k
increased from 7 to 8. c, Silhouette plot for core sample identification. For each sample (yaxis), the silhouette width (x-axis) compares its similarity to its assigned class and to any

nucleotide variants (SNVs) on protein abundance

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

a, The number of different types of SAAVs (TCGA-reported somatic variants, COSMICsupported variants, dbSNP-supported variants, and new variants) in individual tumor
samples. The samples are ordered by the number of detected somatic variants, then
COSMIC-supported variants, and then dbSNP-supported variants. The Microsatellite
instability (MSI) and hypermutation (Hyper) status are labeled below the bar charts for each
sample (MSI-High: red, MSI-Low: orange, Microsatellite Stable: yellow; hypermutated:
blue, non-hypermutated: sky blue; no data: grey). The number of somatic variants and
COSMIC-supported variants were significantly higher in MSI-High and hypermutated
tumors, whereas the other two types of SAAVs were randomly distributed across the data
set. b, The total numbers for different types of SAAVs and their overlapping relations. All
796 detected SAAVs were annotated based on previous reports in dbSNP (left circle),
COSMIC (middle circle), or TCGA-reported somatic variants (right circle), and their
overlapping relations are shown in the Venn diagram. There are 162 SAAVs that have not
been reported previously in these databases (new). c, Distribution of the frequency of
occurrence (1 sample: light grey, 2–9 samples: grey, >=10 samples: dark grey) for different
types of SAAVs. Border colors of the pie charts correspond to different SAAV types using
the same color scheme as in (a). Whereas 58% of dbSNP-supported variants occurred in two
or more samples, almost all somatic variants each occurred in only one sample. d, SNVs
detected in RNA-Seq data were separated into three categories (dbSNP-supported,
COSMIC-supported, and TCGA-Somatic). The impact of individual SNVs on protein
abundance was calculated (see supplementary methods) and the impact scores for different
categories of SNVs were plotted as cumulative fraction curves with two-sided p values from
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test labeled. The percentage of SNVs with an absolute impact
score greater than 2 was also plotted as an inset, with p values from the Chi-squared test.
