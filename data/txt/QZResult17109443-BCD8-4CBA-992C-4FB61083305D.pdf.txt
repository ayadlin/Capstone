Author Manuscript

Brain metastases (BM) are a devastating consequence of breast cancer. BM occur more frequently
in patients with estrogen receptor-negative (ER−) breast cancer subtypes; HER2 overexpressing
(HER2+) tumors and triple-negative (TN) (ER−, progesterone receptor-negative (PR−) and normal
HER2) tumors. Young age is an independent risk factor for development of BM, thus we
speculated that higher circulating estrogens in young, pre-menopausal women could exert
paracrine effects through the highly estrogen-responsive brain microenvironment. Using a TN
experimental metastases model, we demonstrate that ovariectomy decreased the frequency of MRI
detectable lesions by 56% as compared to estrogen supplementation, and that the combination of
ovariectomy and letrozole further reduced the frequency of large lesions to 14.4% of the estrogen
control. Human BM expressed 4.2-48.4% ER+ stromal area, particularly ER+ astrocytes. In vitro,
E2-treated astrocytes increased proliferation, migration and invasion of 231BR-EGFP cells in an
ER-dependent manner. E2 upregulated EGFR ligands Egf, Ereg, and Tgfa mRNA and protein
levels in astrocytes, and activated EGFR in brain metastatic cells. Co-culture of 231BR-EGFP
cells with E2-treated astrocytes led to upregulation of the metastatic mediator S100 Calciumbinding protein A4 (S100A4) (1.78-fold, P<0.05). Exogenous EGF increased S100A4 mRNA

levels in 231BR-EGFP cells (1.40±0.02 fold, P<0.01 compared to vehicle-control) and an EGFR/
HER2 inhibitor blocked this effect, suggesting that S100A4 is a downstream effector of EGFR
activation. ShRNA-mediated S100A4 silencing in 231BR-EGFP cells decreased their migration
and invasion in response to E2-CM, abolished their increased proliferation in co-cultures with E2treated astrocytes, and decreased brain metastatic colonization. Thus, S100A4 is one effector of
the paracrine action of E2 in brain metastatic cells. These studies provide a novel mechanism by
which estrogens, acting through ER+ astrocytes in the brain microenvironment, can promote BM
of TN breast cancers, and suggests existing endocrine agents may provide some clinical benefit
towards reducing and managing BM.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Symptomatic brain metastases (BM) develop in 10 to 16% of patients with metastatic breast
cancer and the prognosis of these patients is dismal with a survival varying from 4 to 18
months with multimodal therapies (1-3). The highest incidence of BM occurs in breast
cancers overexpressing HER2 (HER2+), and triple negative (TN) breast cancers (negative
for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and normal HER2) (4-9). There are
currently no effective targeted therapies for TN tumors, and large antibodies targeting
HER2+ tumors have limited ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Estrogens are the
main mitogens driving the growth of ER+ breast cancers, and thus these tumors are treated
with endocrine targeting agents such as tamoxifen (a selective estrogen modulator (SERM)),
fulvestrant (ICI) (a selective estrogen degrader (SERD)), and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) such
as letrozole which block the enzyme that produces estrogens. Since the vast majority of
breast cancers that colonize the brain are from ER− subtypes, it has been assumed that
estrogens do not play a role in their clinical course. However, TN and HER2+ breast cancers
are more prevalent in pre-menopausal women, and young age (<40) is an independent risk
factor for developing central nervous system (CNS) metastasis (6, 9-15). This suggests that a
brain microenvironment fueled by estrogen might play a role in the development of ER−
BM.

Author Manuscript

The brain microenvironment is highly estrogen-responsive as astrocytes, neurons,
endothelial cells and microglia express classical ERs (ERα and ERβ) as well as non-classical
G-protein coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) (16-19). Estrogens play lifelong roles in the
formation, maintenance, and remodeling of neuronal circuits in the brain (17, 20-22). As
estrogens are small lipophilic molecules, they readily diffuse through the multiple cell
membranes that comprise the BBB to penetrate the CNS. In pre-menopausal women the
brain is exposed to peak estrogen levels during the follicular phase; in the absence of ovarian
estrogens, the brain is not completely estrogen-depleted due to local synthesis by aromataseexpressing astrocytes (23-25). We hypothesized that estrogen acting through the brain
microenvironment would influence the ability of ER− breast cancer cells to colonize the
brain, and investigated the preventive effect of ovarian and peripheral estrogen depletion

using an experimental model of TN breast cancer BM. We demonstrate that 17-β-estradiol
(E2) stimulates the release of astrocyte-derived paracrine factors that promote the
proliferation, migration, and invasion of TN brain metastatic cells. We provide a novel
mechanism by which estrogens indirectly affect the brain metastatic colonization of TN
breast cancer cells. These findings could have significant translational effects as aromatase
inhibitors used to treat ER+ breast tumors can cross the blood brain barrier.

Estrogen depletion decreases brain metastatic colonization of the ER− brain tropic cell
line 231BR-EGFP

To determine whether estrogens affect the ability of ER− cells to colonize the brain, we
utilized the well characterized brain-tropic subline of human TN MDA-MB-231 breast
cancer cells, termed 231-BR-EGFP (26, 27). These cells form high frequencies of BM when
introduced into the circulation of immune compromised mice. For our experiments,
ovariectomized (OVX) female nu/nu mice were implanted with slow release pellets
containing 1mg E2 (E2) or placebo. OVX mice supplemented with placebo pellets were
additionally injected with vehicle-control (OVX) or 10 μg of letrozole daily (OVX
+Letrozole). Two days post endocrine initiation, 231-BR-EGFP cells were introduced via
intracardiac (ic) injection. Macroscopic BM were quantified using T2-weighted and
gadolinium enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 25 to 28 days post
injection and sacrificed thereafter. While 62.5% (10/16) of E2-treated mice developed MRI
detectable metastases (>0.2mm), only 35.2% (6/17) of OVX mice and 9% (1/11) of OVX
+letrozole treated mice developed large BM, a reduction to 56% and 14.4% as compared to
E2-treated mice, respectively (P=0.0186, χ2 test) (Figure 1a). . The mean number of MRI
detectable metastases showed similar trends, 1.37 in estrogen treated controls as compared
to 0.4 (P=0.043) in OVX and 0.18 (P=0.0089) in OVX + Letrozole (Figure 1a). Median
diameter of MRI-detectable metastases was 0.54 mm (range 0.2-2.97 mm) in E2-treated
mice, 0.3 mm (range 0.2-1.64 mm) in OVX, and <0.2 mm in OVX+Letrozole mice (Figure
1b). Occult micrometastases were quantified in step sections through one brain hemisphere
based on a cutoff of 300 μm along the longest axis (26). Ovarian estrogen depletion alone
(OVX) resulted in a median of 17.5 micrometastases per section, and OVX+Letrozole mice
showed a median of 21 micrometastases per section, a reduction of 64% and 56% compared
to E2-treated mice (48.5 median number of micrometastases per section, P=0.0001 and
P=0.0098 respectively, Figure 1c). These data demonstrate that ovarian estrogen and, to a
lesser extent, peripheral estrogen, play a role in brain metastatic colonization of otherwise
estrogen unresponsive TN breast cancer cells.

Astrocytes proximal to breast cancer BM are ER+ in patients and xenograft models
BM are surrounded and infiltrated by activated astrocytes (expressing Glial Fibrillary Acidic
Protein, GFAP), part of the neuro-inflammatory response to metastases in the brain
microenvironment (26). We assessed expression of estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ in the
tumor microenvironments of sections of clinical resected breast cancer metastases and in
experimental 231BR-EGFP BM. Clinically stained sections of BM (n=12) contained ERα+
stroma, with a 75% percentile of 19.89% (mean 15.85±12.25%) positive stromal area,

plotted according to different subtypes (Figure 2a, Supplementary Figure 1). Doubleimmunofluorescence staining showed that this ER+ tumor associated stroma includes GFAP
+ astrocytes, expressing both ERα and ERβ (Figure 2b). Nuclear and membrane localized
expression of ERα and ERβ was observed also in activated astrocytes (GFAP+) surrounding
metastatic lesions the 231BR-EGFP model (Figure 2c). These data support the hypothesis
that the astrocytic brain microenvironment can mediate estrogen signals in the context of
breast cancer BM.
E2-treated astrocytes increase proliferation, migration and invasion of brain metastatic
cells in an ER-dependent manner

Author Manuscript

We hypothesized that estrogens could signal through astrocytes in the neuroinflammatory
response to increase breast cancer cell brain colonization. To test this, we used primary
mouse astrocytes isolated from neonatal mice which contain >95% GFAP+ cells, and human
astrocytes differentiated from the human neural stem cell line K048 (28). Both murine and
human astrocytes stained positive for nuclear and membrane localized ERα and ERβ (Figure
2d, Supplementary Figure 2a). Neither human nor mouse-derived astrocytes contained
detectable levels of non-classical estrogen receptor membrane associated GPR30. The
231BR-EGFP cells lack ERα (Figure 2d), have low levels of ERβ and are unresponsive to
E2, as measured by proliferation, migration, and invasion (Figure 3a, b, & c).

Author Manuscript

To determine if E2 could exert paracrine actions though astrocytes and influence breast
cancer cells, we used a co-culture system. Co-culture with astrocytes led to increased
proliferation of 231BR-EGFP cells in E2 as compared to vehicle-treated samples
(20.12±1.8% GFP+ cells in E2 vs 14.8±2.5% GFP+ in vehicle cells after 6 days, P<0.0001)
(Figure 3a). The selective ER antagonist 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4OH-TAM) and pure-anti
ERα and ERβ ICI were used for in vitro experiments, as letrozole was ineffective in serumfree culture medium. Both agents blocked the increase in E2-mediated proliferation
(10.1±2.4 and 14.9±2.4% GFP+ cells after 6 days, respectively, P<0.0001) (Figure 3a). No
difference in ER expression of astrocytes was noted under these conditions (data not shown).
These data suggest that the paracrine effects of E2 on 231BR-EGFP cell proliferation are
dependent on astrocytic ERs.

Author Manuscript

Since the establishment of metastases depends to a great extent on the ability of cells to
migrate and invade through the extracellular matrix, we determined whether E2 paracrine
factors released from astrocytes could alter the migratory and invasive ability of 231BREGFP cells. Concentrated conditioned media (CM) from E2-treated astrocytes (CM-E2)
increased migration of 231BR-EGFP cells in a scratch wound assay (29.1±58.1 μm wound
at 24 h), as compared to CM from vehicle-treated astrocytes (CM-OH) (196.9±35.7 μm
wound at 24 h, P<0.0001) (Figure 3b). CM from astrocytes treated with E2 in combination
with 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (CM E2+4-OH-TAM) and ICI (CM E2+ICI) abolished this effect
(149.7±30.41 μm and 133.6±10.9 μm, P<0.01 and P<0.05 compared to CM-E2,
respectively) suggesting that paracrine effects of E2 on 231BR-EGFP migration are
dependent on astrocytic ERs (Figure 3b). A modified scratch wound assay was used to
assess the ability of 231BR-EGFP cells to invade through a Matrigel-filled wound, and the
relative wound density (RWD) over time was assessed using IncuCyte live imaging. CM-E2

significantly increased invasion of 231BR-EGFP cells (85.3±1.6% RWD at 24 h) as
compared to CM-OH (72.6%1.6 RWD at 24 h) (P<0.0001), and CM-4OH-TAM and CMICI abolished this effect (73.8.7±3.8% and 73.3±3.2% at 24 h, P<0.001 compared to CME2) (Figure 3c). We confirmed these results by demonstrating 231BR-EGFP cells invade
through Matrigel-coated Boyden chambers, with E2− but not vehicle-treated astrocyte CM
as a chemoattractant (Supplementary Figure 3). Despite the expression of ERβ in 231BREGFP cells, the same treatments had no effect on proliferation, migration or invasion in the
absence of astrocytes (data not shown). These results implicate that E2 can work through
astrocytic ERs to increase 231BR-EGFP cell migration, invasion and proliferation.
E2 upregulates EGFR ligands in astrocytes leading to EGFR activation and increased
migration and invasion of 231BR-EGFP cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGFα) is abundant in astrocytes and its expression
increases in response to E2 (29, 30). TGFα is an EGFR-ligand, and EGFR expression was
increased in human brain metastasis (6,10). EGFR activation is also a well-known
mechanism driving migration, invasion and proliferation of metastatic cells, so we sought to
elucidate whether TGFα and other EGFR ligands are in part responsible for the paracrine
effects of E2 in brain metastatic cells. Tgfα and Ereg mRNA levels were modestly
upregulated following E2− treatment of mouse astrocytes (1.5±0.3 fold increase at 48 h,
P<0.05) while Egf mRNA levels were robustly upregulated at 6 and 48 h after E2stimulation (3.4±0.4 fold change at 6 h and 4.2±0.6 fold change at 48 h, P<0.05) (Figure 4a).
Co-treatment with E2 plus 4OH-Tam or ICI abolished E2-mediated mRNA upregulation for
all ligands (Figure 4b). Upregulation of EGF and TGFα was also observed in E2-treated
human astrocytes (Supplementary Figure 2b). EGF and EREG protein levels were
significantly increased in E2-treated astrocytes (6.2±2.4 and 2.3±0.4 fold increase,
respectively, P<0.05), as compared to OH-treated astrocytes, and both 4-OH-TAM and ICI
abolished this effect (Figure 4c). TGFα precursor measured by western blot, also showed a
3-fold increase in TGFα protein levels in E2-treated compared to vehicle-treated astrocytes,
with only a moderate blockage by 4-OH-TAM and complete blockage with ICI (Figure 4c).
Taken together these results suggest that E2-mediated upregulation of Egf, Tgfα and Ereg in
astrocytes is dependent on ERs.

231BR-EGFP cells express high levels of EGFR and EGFR activation drives migration and
invasion in this cell line (31). Thus, we asked whether CM from E2-stimulated astrocytes
could activate EGFR in 231BR-EGFP cells, and whether EGFR activation is a downstream
effector for astrocytic ligands that increase the aggressive behavior of 231BR-EGFP cells in
response to CM-E2. Since the EGFR/HER inhibitor lapatinib has been shown to reduce
EGFR activation and downstream signaling in 231BR-EGFP cells in vitro (31), we used
lapatinib to block EGFR activation in response to CM-E2 and measure its role in migration
and invasion. Treatment of 231BR-EGFP cells with CM-E2 but not CM-OH resulted in
EGFR phosphorylation (Y1068) and lapatinib abolished this effect (Figure 4d). Treatment
with media containing OH or E2 alone, did not lead to EGFR phosphorylation (data not
shown), suggesting that the residual E2 present in the CM is not directly responsible for
EGFR phosphorylation. Lapatinib inhibited the increase in migration and invasion of

231BR-EGFP cells in response to CM-E2, suggesting a role for EGFR activation in
mediating paracrine effects of E2 (Figure 4d).
The metastasis mediator S100A4 is a downstream effector of astrocyte activated EGFR
in 231BR-EGFP cells

We next measured global gene expression of 231BR-EGFP co-cultured for 24hr with
astrocytes pre-treated with vehicle or 10 nM E2 for 24 h. E2 treatment in the absence of
astrocytes did not alter gene expression profiles, confirming that E2 does not directly affect
gene expression in 231BR-EGFP cells. We identified 254 genes that were differentially
expressed (fold change >1.5 and p<0.05) in 231BR-EGFP cells in co-culture with E2stimulated (E2Astro/231BR) compared to OH-stimulated astrocytes (OHAstro/231BR) (Figure
5a, Supplementary Table 1). The S100 Calcium-binding protein A4 (S100A4) was
significantly upregulated (1.78 fold change, P<0.05) in E2Astro/231BR cells as compared to
OHAstro/231BR. qRT-PCR confirmed the mRNA upregulation of S100A4 in E2Astro 231BREGFP cells (6.6±1.7 vs. 1.8±1.4 fold increase in E2 vs OH treated-respectively, P<0.05), and
treatment of astrocytes with E2+ICI abolished this effect (1.5±0.3 fold increase, P<0.05 vs
E2Astro-treated) (Figure 5b), suggesting that S100A4 upregulation depends on E2-ER
signaling in astrocytes.

Author Manuscript

We next determined whether S100A4 mRNA upregulation in 231BR-EGFP cells was
dependent on EGFR activation. 231BR-EGFP cells were pretreated with vehicle or lapatinib
for 6 h, then treated with EGF or vehicle (OH) for an additional 48 h. EGF upregulated
S100A4 mRNA levels in 231BR-EGFP cells (1.40±0.02 fold increase in EGF-treated vs
1.0±0.07 fold in DMSO-control, P<0.01) (Figure 5c), and lapatinib decreased this effect
(1.13±0.05 fold change in EGF/LAP treated cells), suggesting that S100A4 is a downstream
effector of EGFR activation in 231BR-EGFP cells.

Author Manuscript

As S100A4 is important in promoting proliferation, migration and metastasis (32, 33), we
sought to elucidate the role of S100A4 in mediating the E2-stimulated increases in
proliferation, migration and invasion of 231BR-EGFP cells. Three different shRNA
lentiviral vectors (sh6308, sh6309, sh6310) were used to knockdown S100A4 expression in
231BR-EGFP cells. All shRNAs were able to abolish the upregulation of S100A4 in
response to E2-treated astrocytes (Figure 6a, Supplementary Figure 4), compared to
scramble-control shRNA (Sh-NC) cells. Furthermore, S100A4 inhibition blocked the
increases in migration (Figure 6b), invasion (Figure 6c) and proliferation (Figure 6d) of
231BR-EGFP cells in response to E2-treated astrocytes S100A4 knockdown also
significantly decreased the ability of 231BR-EGFP cells to proliferate in response to EGF
(Figure 6e), further supporting S100A4 as an effector downstream of EGFR activation.
ShS100A4-231BR (sh6309) cells showed a significant decrease in its ability to form
metastases in E2-treated mice (median number of metastases 0), as compared to shNC cells
(median number of metastases 48, P<0.0001) (Figure 6f). Taken together, these data suggest
that S100A4 is a key mediator of the paracrine effects of estrogen in 231BR cells.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Elucidating the participation of the brain microenvironment during the brain metastatic
process is of crucial importance for the identification of therapeutic and preventive
alternatives. Despite the well-known role of estrogen in normal brain functioning (22, 34),
the effects of ovarian and local estrogens in the context of brain metastatic progression
remain unknown. Our studies showing that estrogen supplementation to levels found in premenopausal women significantly increase brain metastatic colonization in the 231-BREGFP experimental model, are first to demonstrate a role for estrogen in brain metastatic
colonization of TN breast cancer cells. We used both MRI-based quantification of large
brain metastases and histological count of micrometastases to measure the contribution of
ovarian and peripheral estrogen to brain metastatic colonization. Micromestases count did
not show any added effect of letrozole to ovariectomy in preventing brain colonization.
However, addition of letrozole was more effective than ovariectomy alone in decreasing the
frequency and size of MRI-detectable metastases to 14.4% of E2-treated mice (compared to
a reduction of 56% by ovariectomy alone). This suggests that in the absence of ovarian
estrogen (i.e in post-menopausal women), locally produced estrogen plays a role in
promoting the growth of brain metastatic cells.

Author Manuscript

E2 has been previously shown to accelerate the growth of ER− patient-derived xenograft
tumors by influencing the mobilization and recruitment of a pro-angiogenic population of
bone marrow–derived myeloid cells to the tumor microenvironment and increasing
angiogenesis (35, 36). However, brain metastatic colonization of breast cancer does not
necessarily rely on neo-angiogenesis (37, 38), suggesting that the paracrine effects of
estrogen in the brain microenvironment are likely to involve other cell populations and
mechanisms. Here we investigated the role of reactive astrocytes as they are known to
surround and infiltrate BM in human and experimental models (39-42), and astrocytes play
important roles in mediating the responses to estrogen in the normal and injured brain (16,
21, 43-45).We distinctly detected ERα in stromal cells surrounding human breast cancers,
and double immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that this ER+ stroma is comprised of
GFAP+ reactive astrocytes. This stromal expression of ERα is not routinely evaluated during
diagnosis of human breast tumors or their metastases; however, it could be relevant if a
correlation between stromal ERα expression, prognosis, and/or treatment response could be
addressed in women with brain metastatic breast cancer.

Author Manuscript

Our results demonstrate that E2-treated human and mouse astrocytes promote proliferation,
migration and invasion of 231BR-EGFP cells in vitro, in part through the upregulation of
EGFR ligands. We demonstrate that this effect is abolished by 4-OH-TAM and ICI,
indicating that the paracrine action of E2 depends on astrocytic ERs but the contribution of
ERα and ERβ to each phenotype remains unknown. Previous studies have extensively
deciphered signaling downstream of EGFR activation in 231BR-EGFP cells and shown that
EGFR activation is critical for migration and invasion in vitro, and for brain metastatic
colonization in vivo (31). Since EGFR overexpression is a known risk factor for BM (7)
particularly in TN tumors, it is likely that increased levels of EGFR ligands by astrocytes in
pre-menopausal women could play a critical role in the ability of TN EGFR expressing brain
metastases to colonize the brain.

The paracrine actions of estrogen observed in 231BR-EGFP cells are likely to involve
molecules downstream of EGFR activation as well as other unidentified pathways. We show
that co-culture with E2-treated astrocytes leads to global changes in gene expression in
231BR-EGFP cells, including S100A4, and that S100A4 is required to mediate the paracrine
effects of estrogen in vitro and in vivo. S100A4 is highly expressed in metastatic tumor cell
lines (46) and it exhibits its prometastatic role via affecting apoptosis, cytoskeletal integrity,
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), tumor-related transcription factors, and stromal factors
(33, 46,47). Interestingly, the 231BR-EGFP cells do not express S100A4 endogenously, but
only upregulate its expression in response to co-culture with E2-treated astrocytes, further
demonstrating that the paracrine action of estrogen can facilitate metastasis. Given the
complex bi-directional signaling between astrocytes and breast cancer cells (48-50), further
analyses are required to determine the extent to which other genes (both in astrocyte and
breast cancer cells) participate in this process.

Author Manuscript

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that estrogen depletion significantly reduces brain
metastatic burden in a TN experimental model in vivo and have provided a novel mechanism
whereby estrogen acting on ER+ astrocytes, promotes migration, invasion and proliferation
of otherwise estrogen-unresponsive TN brain metastatic cells (Figure 7). Importantly, our
study suggest that ovarian estrogen depletion and aromatase inhibitors could be of value for
the prevention of BM in women with TN EGFR+ tumors at high risk of BM.

Murine cortical primary astrocytes were cultured from postnatal day 1-3 pups as described
(51,52). Astrocyte-enriched glial cell cultures were checked for purity and only preparations
with >90% GFAP+ cells were used. To obtain 10X concentrated astrocytic-conditioned
media (CM), 100% confluent astrocyte cultures were rinsed and incubated for 72 h with
serum-free media containing different hormonal treatments. Supernatants were collected and
cleared from cell debris and then concentrated by passing it through a 3000 Dalton cutoff
centrifuge tube (Millipore) until volume was 1/10 of the initial volume. CM was used
immediately or stored at −80C.

sorted cells were collected directly in RNA lyses buffer for RNA isolation (RNAqueousMicroKit). CDNA for qRT-PCR was synthesized using the MuLV reverse transcriptase
(Applied Biosystems). β-actin or GAPDG were used for normalization. The relative mRNA
levels were calculated using the comparative Ct method (ΔΔCt).
Gene Expression profiling

Author Manuscript

Integrity of triplicate RNA samples was confirmed on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent). The cDNA
was generated according to the GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual
(Affymetrix). Labeled complementary RNA was made using the GeneChip_IVT Labeling
Kit (Affymetrix), fragmented, and hybridized to Human Gene 1.1 ST Arrays. Probe
intensities were exported into Partek Genomics Suite (v6.6, Partek, Inc. St. Louis, MO)
where RMA normalization was applied, resulting in log2-transformed expression intensities
for each transcript in each sample. Data were filtered using a 1.5-fold change cutoff and a P
value of 0.05. Microarray data access # GSE71272.
Migration Assays

Author Manuscript

231BR-EGFP cells were serum starved for 6 h and 40.000 cells per well were plated on a
96-well Essen ImageLock plate. Adhered cells were starved in serum-free media for 16 h
and a scratch wound performed using a 96-pin WoundMaker and then treated with hormones
or astrocytic CM. Wound images were taken every 4h for 24h and the wound width
calculated at each time point. In experiments using lapatinib, cells were pretreated with 1
μM lapatinib or DMSO controls for 6 h prior to scratch wound. Each treatment was
performed in 4-biological replicates in at least two independent experiments.

Invasion assays

Author Manuscript

Cells were plated in matrigel-coated plates, a scratch wound made and filled with 4 μg/ml
Matrigel and treated as in migration assays. Relative wound density was calculated for each
time point. Alternatively, invasion was measured in Boyden chamber assays: 231BR-EGFP
cells were serum-starved for 6h and then 200,000 cells were plated on top of growth factorreduced Matrigel-coated boyden chambers (BD-Pharmingen). CM from hormonally treatedastrocytes was used as chemoattractant. Cells were allowed to invade for 24 h, the invading
cells fixed on the opposite side of the filter and stained using crystal violet. Percentage of the
filter covered by invading cells was calculated using Image J. Each treatment was performed
in triplicate in at least two independent experiments.
Reagents

Author Manuscript

Primary antibodies included rat anti-GFAP (Invitrogen, CA); α-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA), Estrogen Receptor α (C1355) (Millipore, Temecula, CA), Estrogen
Receptor β, clone 68-4 (Millipore), S100A4 (Abcam), Pan-cytokeratin MNF116
(Dakocytomation, Denmark); Phospho-EGF Receptor (Tyr1068) and total EGFR (Cell
Signaling, Boston, MA). For western blot, secondary antibodies were Alexa-fluor 680 AntiRabbit or Anti-Mouse IgG (Invitrogen, NY) detected using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging
System (Licor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). For immunohistochemistry, secondary antibodies
were anti-mouse Alexafluor-488 or anti-rabbit Alexafluo-555 (Invitrogen). ER antagonists
included 4-OH-tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich) and ICI 182780 (Tocris bioscience; R&D
systems, Minneapolis, MN). The EGFR/HER2 inhibitor Lapatinib was purchased from
Selleckchem (Houston, TX).
Experimental BM

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Animal studies were approved by the University of Colorado Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee. BM were developed by injecting 175,000 231BR-EGFP cells in 100 μl PBS
in the left ventricle of ovariectomized 5-7 week old female nu/nu mice (Charles River).
Randomly assigned mice were implanted with pellets containing either E2 (1mg) or placebo,
two days before tumor inoculation. The dose of E2 used in these studies is required to
promote tumor growth of estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells in nude mice (53) and it is
within serum-levels in pre-menopausal women (~50-150pg/ml)(54) . Letrozole is an
aromatase inhibitor known to cross the BBB; here it was used to prevent the local production
of E2 in the brain. Letrozole (Selleck chemical, Houston TX) was diluted in 0.3% hydroxylpropyl cellulose at 0.2 mg/ml and 50 μl were injected subcutaneously daily (10μg/day).
Metastatic brain burden was measured using high-resolution T2-weigthed and gadolinium
enhanced T2-weigted-MRI at 25 days post-injection. Mice were euthanized 28 days after
tumor cell injection, and the brains were removed at necropsy. For quantification of micrometastases, six hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)–stained serial sections (10-μm-thick), one
every 300 μm in a sagittal plane through the right hemisphere of the brain were analyzed
using an ocular grid (4X objective). Every micrometastases (≤300 μm) along the longest
axis, respectively) in each section was tabulated by an investigator blinded to the
experimental groups.

MRI

Author Manuscript

Animals were injected with 0.4 mmol/kg gadolinium contrast Multihance (gadobenate
dimeglumine, Bracco Diagnostic) via tail vein. Animals were inserted into a Bruker 4.7
Tesla MRI PharmaScan (Bruker Medical) under 2-2.5% isoflurane. High-resolution RARE
(rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement) T2-weighted images with fat suppression
were obtained (TR/TE= 4000/ 80 ms) followed by a MSME (multi slice multi echo) T1weighted sequence (TR/TE= 700/ 11 ms). All images were obtained in the axial plane, with
the field of view of 3 cm, slice thickness 1 mm, number of slices 16, matrix size 256×256.
In-plane resolution was 90 μm. All images were acquired and analyzed (for lesion numbers
and diameters) using Bruker ParaVision (v4.0) software (55), by an investigator blinded to
the experimental groups.
Statistical Analysis

Author Manuscript

Statistics were done using Graphpad Prism 6.0 software. One way ANOVA or repeated
measured ANOVA followed by multiple comparison post hoc tests were used when samples
met variance and normality tests. P values <0.05 were considered significant. Chi-square
was used to compare frequency of MRI-detectable metastases. Number of MRI detectable
metastases and median numner of micrometastases were analyzed using one-way nonparametric t-test (Mann-Whitney) or ANOVA (Kruskal Wallis) tests followed by Dunn’s
multiple comparison test. For animal experiments, sample size was calculated at 80% power,
two sided tests and α=0.05.

a. Primary mouse astrocytes were treated with vehicle (OH) or 10 nM E2 for the indicated
times and qRT-PCR was used to measure Egf, Tgfα and Ereg mRNA levels. Bars represent
fold change mRNA levels normalized to mouse β-Actin mRNA and relative to OH-treated.
*P<0.05, **P<0.01 vs. OH-control. n=3. b. Astrocytes were cultured in serum-free media
containing vehicle (OH) or E2 alone (10 nM) or E2 in combination with 1 μM 4-OH-Tam
(E2+TAM) or 100 nM ICI (E2+ICI) for qRT-PCR at 24 h (for Egf and Ereg) or 48 h (for
Tgfα). Graph shows mRNA levels normalized to mouse β-actin relative to OH-treated
astrocytes. Bars are average ± SEM. c. Astrocytes were cultured as in b for 48 h, and cell
lysates assessed by ELISA (mEGF, mEREG) or Western blot (TGFα). Graphs shows mEGF
and mEREG concentration in 1 μg total cell lysate. Bars are average ± SEM. WB shows
precursor TGFα (16KD), GAPDH was used as loading control. Numbers indicate fold
change of TGFα/GAPDH relative to OH-treated cells. d. 231BR-EGFP cells were starved
for 12 h, treated with 1 uM lapatinib or vehicle (DMSO) for 6 h and then stimulated with 10
ng/ml EGF, CM-OH or CM-E2 for 10 min. GAPDH was used as loading control. e. 231BREGFP cells were plated in uncoated (left, migration) or matrigel-coated (right, invasion)
plates, serum-starved for 16 h and treated with 1 μM lapatinib for 3 h. After scratch wound,
invasion well were coated with matrigel and then CM-OH or CM-E2 used as
chemoattractant. Graphs show average wound width ±SEM (migration) and average RWD ±
SEM (invasion). For all graphs, *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.

Figure 7. A simplified scheme of the paracrine effects of estrogen in brain metastases

Author Manuscript

Consistent with the notion that breast cancer cells benefit from normal homeostasis
mechanisms at the metastatic site (48, 50), our data supports a novel mechanism whereby
brain metastatic cells exploit estrogen signaling though ER+ astrocytes. Estrogen can
activate ERs on astrocytes, leading to transcriptional upregulation of EGFR ligands,
activation of EGFR on TN EGFR+ brain metastatic breast cancer cells, and upregulation of
several metastatic mediators, including S100A4. Given the complex bi-directional
interactions between astrocytes and breast cancer cells, it is possible that other factors
regulated by ERs in astrocytes and receptors on brain metastatic cells participate in this
process. Ovarian and local estrogen depletion decrease brain metastatic colonization of TN
EGFR+ 231BR cells in vivo, emphasizing the need to consider the brain microenvironment
in designing novel therapies for brain metastases and the possibility to extend the use of
aromatase inhibitors in the prevention of brain metastases in TN EGFR+ patients.
