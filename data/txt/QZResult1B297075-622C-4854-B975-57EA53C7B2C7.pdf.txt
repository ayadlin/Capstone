from tumors [tumor-derived endothelial cells (TDEC); refs. 8, 9].
Treatment with calcitriol promotes G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and
induces apoptosis in TDEC (9, 10). The growth inhibition observed
in TDEC is accompanied by the modulation of cell cycle
proteins (p21 and p27), down-regulation of survival markers
(phosphorylated-Akt and phosphorylated-Erk), and increase in
cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP (9).
The actions of calcitriol are mediated by the vitamin D receptor
(VDR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily (11). VDR
expression is observed in several endothelial cell types, including
TDEC (9, 12, 13). Treatment with calcitriol induces the upregulation of VDR protein expression, promotes receptor phosphorylation, and increases receptor trafficking into the nucleus in
TDEC (9). Ligand-bound VDR heterodimerizes with the retinoid
X receptor and interacts with specific DNA sequences to regulate
gene expression (9, 14).
The physiologic consequences of calcitriol/VDR disruption have
been investigated in animals and humans deficient in vitamin D as
well as in those with VDR mutations (15–18). Defects in VDR
structure, which impair the function of the receptor, are shown to
be the molecular basis for the human vitamin D–resistant rickets
(19, 20). The study of mice with targeted ablation of VDR has
provided substantial insights into the role of the receptor in various
calcitriol effects (11, 21–23). In the VDR knockout (KO) mice, VDR
ablation seems to increase sensitivity to mammary gland
tumorigenesis and chemical-induced skin carcinogenesis. Thus,
supporting the role of vitamin D signaling in tumor development
(6, 24). Whether VDR plays a major role in calcitriol-mediated
antiproliferative effects on TDEC or tumor angiogenesis is unclear.
Because formation of blood vessels in the tumor requires
participation from the host cells (25, 26), in this study, we
compared TDEC isolated from tumors derived from a cell line
established from the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse
prostate model (TRAMP-C2) in VDR wild-type (WT) and KO mice.
TRAMP cells express WT VDR but the endothelial cells recruited
into the tumors will be determined by the hosts’ genetic
background.

Abstract
Calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol), the major active
form of vitamin D, is antiproliferative in tumor cells and
tumor-derived endothelial cells (TDEC). These actions of
calcitriol are mediated at least in part by vitamin D receptor
(VDR), which is expressed in many tissues including endothelial cells. To investigate the role of VDR in calcitriol effects on
tumor vasculature, we established TRAMP-2 tumors subcutaneously into either VDR wild-type (WT) or knockout (KO)
mice. Within 30 days post-inoculation, tumors in KO mice
were larger than those in WT (P < 0.001). TDEC from WT
expressed VDR and were able to transactivate a reporter gene
whereas TDEC from KO mice were not. Treatment with
calcitriol resulted in growth inhibition in TDEC expressing
VDR. However, TDEC from KO mice were relatively resistant,
suggesting that calcitriol-mediated growth inhibition on TDEC
is VDR-dependent. Further analysis of the TRAMP-C2 tumor
sections revealed that the vessels in KO mice were enlarged
and had less pericyte coverage compared with WT (P < 0.001).
Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed an
increase in vascular volume of TRAMP tumors grown in VDR
KO mice compared with WT mice (P < 0.001) and FITCdextran permeability assay suggested a higher extent of
vascular leakage in tumors from KO mice. Using ELISA and
Western blot analysis, there was an increase of hypoxiainducible factor-1A, vascular endothelial growth factor,
angiopoietin 1, and platelet-derived growth factor-BB levels
observed in tumors from KO mice. These results indicate
that calcitriol-mediated antiproliferative effects on TDEC are
VDR-dependent and loss of VDR can lead to abnormal tumor
angiogenesis. [Cancer Res 2009;69(3):967–75]

Introduction
Calcitriol has effects on multiple tissues by regulating cell
proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (1, 2). Calcitriol has
profound antitumor activity in many in vitro and in vivo human
and murine tumor models, including leukemia (3), squamous cell
carcinoma (4), prostate (5), breast (6), and colon cancer (7).
Calcitriol has antiproliferative effects not only on malignant
epithelial cells (2), but also on endothelial cells freshly isolated

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Reagents
Calcitriol (Hoffmann-LaRoche) was reconstituted in 100% ethanol and
stored, protected from light, under a layer of nitrogen gas at 70jC. All
handling of calcitriol was performed with indirect lighting. Immediately
prior to use, calcitriol was diluted to the final concentrations in tissue
culture medium. For most applications, calcitriol was used at 10 nmol/L, a
concentration that consistently shows antiproliferative effects in multiple
assays in a variety of tumor cell types. Albumin-GdDTPA (courtesy of Robert
Brasch) was obtained from Contrast Media Laboratory, Department of

microscope, images of five fields at consistent locations for each sample
were taken at 100 magnification. The average number of microvessels per
field was calculated using Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Vessels
with a clearly defined lumen or a well-defined linear vessel shape were
counted. Single endothelial cells were not counted as vessels.
Vessel lumen area. Images of vessels at the locations described above
were taken at high-power field (magnification, 400). Vessel lumen area
was determined using the software Analyze 7.0 (AnalyzeDirect), by
measuring the vessel lumen circumference stained with CD31 antibody.
Pericyte coverage analysis. Images of vessels in sections stained with
CD31 and a-SMA were taken at high-power field (magnification, 400).
CD31- and a-SMA–positive areas were measured for each vessel using
Analyze 7.0 software. Pericyte coverage for each vessel was calculated
using the formula: (CD31 and a-SMA overlapping area) / (total CD31
positive area).

This agent has been extensively characterized and used for experimental
studies (27).

Animal Models
A breeding colony of VDR KO mice was established from mice
generously provided by Dr. Marie Demay (Harvard Medical School, Boston,
MA). The phenotype of these mice, generated by targeted ablation of the
second zinc finger of the DNA-binding domain of the VDR, resembles the
human vitamin D–dependent rickets type II (11). Mice were genotyped by
PCR amplification of DNA isolated from tail cuts using primers targeting
exon 3 (second zinc finger region) for WT mice and the neomycin gene
(replaces exon 3) for KO mice. All VDR KO and WT mice were fed with a
diet containing 2% calcium, 1.25% phosphorus, and 20% lactose with 2.2 IU
vitamin D3/g (TD96348; Teklad). This diet has been shown to normalize
serum mineral homeostasis, bone growth, and body weight in VDR KO
mice (28). TRAMP C2 (TRAMP) cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with
10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (29). TRAMP-2 cells
(2  106) were inoculated s.c. in 0.1 mL HBSS/Matrigel (1:1) solution into
age-matched VDR WT and KO male mice. Tumor growth was monitored
over time and tumor size was measured using calipers. Tumor volumes
were calculated by the following formula: volume = (length  width2) / 2.
After 31 days, tumors were harvested and processed for endothelial cell
isolation, immunohistochemical, or molecular studies. All mice breeding
and handling were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at Roswell Park Cancer Institute.

Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Magnetic resonance imaging of tumor-bearing mice was carried out in a
4.7 T horizontal bore scanner (General Electric NMR Instruments). We have
previously described the imaging protocol for calculating tumor vascular
volume using the intravascular contrast agent, albumin-GbDTPA (27).
Regional precontrast T1 values were calculated from a series of three
preliminary images acquired prior to contrast agent administration.
Following these baseline acquisitions, albumin-GdDTPA (0.1 mmol/kg)
was injected via tail vein and a second series of five post-contrast images
was acquired for f45 min, as described previously (27). Image processing
and analysis were carried out using commercially available software
(Analyze PC, version 7.0; AnalyzeDirect). Regions of interest of tumors,
kidneys, and muscle tissues were manually drawn on the images and object
maps of the regions of interest constructed. The longitudinal relaxation rate
(R1 = 1/T1) for each region of interest was computed using MATLAB
(version 7.0; Math Works, Inc.), and source codes were developed by RPCI
Preclinical Imaging Resource. Linear regression analysis of the change in RI
(DRI) over the 45 min period was used to compare vascular volume and
permeability (27) and differences between tumors in WT (n = 7) and KO
mice (n = 8) analyzed for statistical significance using Prism (version 5.00,
GraphPad Prism).

Isolation of TDEC
Isolation and identification of TDEC from TRAMP tumors implanted in
VDR WT and KO mice were performed using procedures described
previously (9, 30). TDEC were cultured on 1% gelatin-coated flasks (Corning
Glass, Inc.) in DMEM/10% v/v fetal bovine serum/1% penicillin and
streptomycin. For all experiments, endothelial cells used were at low
passage (<8).

Immunohistochemistry
Endothelial CD31 staining. Tumors were excised and immediately
placed in zinc fixative (BD Biosciences PharMingen) overnight, transferred
to 70% ethanol, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Sections 5 Am thick
were stained after conventional deparaffinization, endogenous peroxidase
quenching with 3% H2O2, and pretreatment with 0.03% casein in PBS with
500 AL/L of Tween for 30 min at room temperature to block nonspecific
binding. Slides were counterstained with Harris hematoxylin (Poly
Scientific). Mouse CD31 was detected with rat monoclonal antibody
(IgG2a; BD Biosciences PharMingen) at 1:50 dilution in PBS for 60 min at
37jC. This was followed by the addition of biotinylated rabbit anti-rat IgG
(BD Biosciences PharMingen) at 1:100 dilution for 30 min, streptavidin
peroxidase (Zymed) for 30 min, and diaminobenzidine for 5 min. An
isotype-matched control (10 Ag/mL rat IgG) was used on a duplicate slide in
place of the primary antibody as a negative control.
CD31/A-smooth muscle actin double staining. Frozen sections (6 Am)
were cut and stored at 80jC until the assay was run. The slides were
thawed quickly and fixed for 10 min in cold acetone ( 20jC). After
blocking, a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) antibody was used at 1/250 for
30 min and was detected by biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary
antibody 25 min followed by streptavidin peroxidase for an additional
25 min. 3,3¶-Diaminobenzidine was used as the chromogen for a-SMA. After
a second blocking step, sections were incubated with CD31 (BD Biosciences
PharMingen) at 5 Ag/mL for 30 min followed by biotinylated anti-rat
secondary antibody for 25 min and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated
streptavidin reagent for 25 min. The chromogen, Fast Red, was used to
detect CD31. An isotype-matched control (2 Ag/mL rabbit IgG and 5 Ag/mL
rat IgG) was used on a duplicate slide in place of the primary antibody as a
negative control.

In vivo Evans Blue Dye Assay

Mice received intracardiac injections of 200 AL of Evans blue dye (0.5%;
Sigma) for 5 min while under anesthesia. After sacrifice, tumors and livers
were collected and incubated with formamide (Fisher) at 55jC overnight.
The amount of dye extracted from each sample was quantitated by
spectrophotometry (Spectra Max 340PC) at 610 nm. Data were normalized
with sample weight and data obtained from the liver.

FITC-Dextran Permeability Assay
Mice were given intracardiac injection with 200 AL of saline containing
2 Amol/L of lysine-fixable FITC-labeled dextran (FITC-D 2  106 molecular
weight; Molecular Probes) for 5 min followed by 2 min of 0.05 mol/L citrate
in 1% paraformaldehyde (pH 3.5) while under anesthesia. After sacrifice,
tumors and livers were collected immediately and frozen using optimal
cutting temperature compound. Five-micrometer-thick sections were
prepared and mounted in VectaShield with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(Vector Laboratories) followed by analysis with a confocal microscopy
(Leica TCS SP2, Leica Microsytems).

Tetrazolium Salt 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide Assay

TDEC were plated at the range of 1  103 to 2  103 cells/well into
96-well tissue culture plates (Corning Glass) and incubated at 37jC in a
humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. After 24 h post-plating, cells
were either treated for 48 h with vehicle or varying doses of calcitriol. Cells
were harvested by adding 20 AL of 0.5% 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma) for 3 h at 37jC. The medium was
removed, and the cells were solubilized with 10% SDS/10 mmol/L HCl
overnight at 37jC. The absorbance was read with an ELISA reader (Spectra
Max 340PC) at 490 nm.

Western Blot Analysis

24-Hydroxylase Promoter-Luciferase Reporter Assay

Twenty-four hours post-plating, the cells were treated with vehicle or
10 nmol/L of calcitriol. After 48 h, the cells were harvested and whole cell
lysates were prepared using lysis buffer as described previously (9). For
in vivo tumor and Matrigel plug specimens, protein lysates were prepared
using CelLytic Lysis Buffer (Sigma). Protein samples (30 Ag) were resolved
by SDS-PAGE, and transferred overnight to polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes. Western blot analysis was performed as previously described.
Antibodies used include VDR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), hypoxiainducible factor-1a (HIF-1a; ABR), vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), VEGF receptor 2 (Cell Signaling),
angiopoietin 1 (Ang1; U.S. Biologicals), Tie1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
Tie2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PDGF receptor-h (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary
antibodies were purchased from Amersham Life Sciences and actin was
detected using the actin kit from Oncogene Research Products.

Cells were plated on 48-well plates and cultured for 24 h in 5% charcoalstripped medium and then treated for 3 h with a constant dose of adenovirus containing h-galactosidase and adenovirus containing 24-hydroxylase
promoter-luciferase construct or adenoviral empty vector control in serumfree medium. The cells were treated with varying doses of calcitriol for
48 h in 5% charcoal-stripped medium. Cells were harvested and cell lysates
were obtained as described previously (9). The cell lysates were then
subjected to Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega) and the light produced
was measured with a luminometer (Veritas Microplate Luminometer). hGalactosidase activity was obtained using h-Galactosidase Enzyme Assay
System (Promega) and the absorbance was measured with an ELISA reader
(Spectra Max 340PC) at 520 nm. The relative luciferase unit was obtained by
normalizing the luciferase unit with the activity of h-galactosidase and total
protein from each lysate.

Cell Cycle Analysis
Endothelial cells were plated and treated at a final concentration
10 nmol/L of calcitriol. Cells were harvested 48 h after treatment by
trypsinization, washed using PBS and fixed with 70% ethanol. The cells were
RNase-treated prior to staining with 400 AL of 50 Ag/mL propidium iodide
(Sigma) in PBS solution, filtered through a 30 Am nylon mesh, and analyzed
by flow cytometry using a BD FACScan. Cell cycle analysis was performed
using ModFit software.
Statistical analysis. Differences between groups were analyzed for
statistical significance using Student’s t test (two-tailed). All data were

ELISA
Protein lysates were prepared from tumors using CelLytic Lysis Buffer
(Sigma). All ELISA procedures were performed using ELISA development
kits, murine VEGF (PeproTech, Inc.), murine HIF-1a (R&D Systems), murine
Ang1 (R&D Systems), and murine PDGF-B (R&D Systems) following the
instructions of the manufacturer. Data were collected from at least five
samples from each group and were measured in triplicate.

stated otherwise.

observed in calcitriol-treated TDEC from WT mice (Table 1). These
effects were not observed in TDEC from KO mice. These results
indicate that calcitriol-mediated growth inhibition in TDEC is a
VDR-dependent event.
Vessels in TRAMP-2 tumors in VDR KO mice are enlarged
and have lower pericyte coverage. Detailed examination of the
tumor vascular morphology was performed by immunohistochemical staining of tumor sections for the endothelial cell marker,
CD31. Although mean vessel density was not different between the
two groups, vessel lumen size and percentage vessel area per field
were higher in tumors of KO mice when compared with WT mice
(P < 0.001; Table 2). Using CD31 and a-SMA (pericyte marker)
double staining to measure pericyte coverage vessels in the tumor
of VDR KO mice have less pericyte coverage when compared with
those in WT mice (Fig. 2B). In WT mice, the average pericyte
coverage of the vessels is 39%, whereas tumor vessels in KO mice
have f11% pericyte coverage (Table 2). These findings suggest a
lower degree of vessel maturation in VDR KO vessels. In addition
to the microvessels, there was also a proportion of enlarged vessels
found in KO mice and these are not obvious in WT animals
(Fig. 2A; Table 2).
Tumors in VDR WT and KO mice have different vascular
properties and size. To evaluate the functional implications of
these morphologic differences, we examined tumor perfusion using
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Change in longitudinal relaxation rates (DR1) of tumors implanted in WT and KO
mice were plotted as a function of time and variables of vascular
volume (Y-intercept) and permeability (slope) calculated. The
vascular volume of TRAMP-C2 tumors implanted in KO mice
(0.1953 F 0.005) was significantly higher than tumors implanted in
WT (0.1047 F 0.0205; P < 0.0001; Fig. 3A). There was no difference
in vascular permeability between the two types of tumors (Fig. 3A).

Results
TDEC isolated from VDR KO mice are not sensitive to
calcitriol-mediated growth inhibition. We showed that calcitriol
exerts growth-inhibitory effects on TDEC by inducing G0/G1 cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis (9). To determine the role of VDR on
these effects, we isolated TDEC from TRAMP-2 tumors grown for
30 days in WT and KO mice, using methods previously described
(29). As shown in Fig. 1A, there was no obvious difference in cell
morphology of TDEC when isolated from different VDR genotype
mice. The doubling time for each cell type was similar (data not
shown). Upon treatment with calcitriol, VDR expression was
induced in TDEC isolated from WT but not in those from KO
mice (Fig. 1B). Using the 24-hydroxylase promoter-luciferase
reporter, we showed that in TDEC expressing VDR, but not those
from KO mice, calcitriol transactivated CYP24, a calcitriolresponsive gene (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that endothelial
cells derived from TRAMP tumors grown in VDR KO mice were
VDR negative and could not activate the VDR-mediated signaling
pathway.
TDEC from these mice were treated with 0 to 500 nmol/L of
calcitriol for 48 hours and cell viability was determined using the
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay.
TDEC expressing VDR were growth inhibited in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 1D). However, in the absence of VDR, TDEC were
minimally affected by similar treatment (Fig. 1D). The growth
inhibition observed in TDEC expressing VDR was accompanied by
an induction of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, as measured by propidium
iodide staining (Table 1). An increase of G0/G1 phase cells from 45%
to 77% and a decrease of S phase cells from 53% to 23% were

No differences were observed in the expression of the receptors
for Ang1 (Tie1 and Tie2) and PDGF-BB (PDGF-Rh) between these
tumors (Fig. 4E). Increased expression of these proangiogenic
signaling molecules could, at least in part, account for the observed
tumor vasculature characteristics in VDR KO mice.

No significant change in the longitudinal relaxation rates was
observed in kidneys and muscle tissues between VDR WT and VDR
KO mice (data not shown).
We further evaluated vascular volume and permeability using
quantitative in vivo Evans blue dye assay and qualitative FITCdextran staining. Tumors from VDR KO mice showed a significantly higher Evans blue dye content (P = 0.029), indicating a
higher vascular volume in these tumors (Fig. 3B). Confocal
microscopy analysis of FITC-dextran–stained tumor vasculature
showed a higher degree of plasma extravasation in KO versus WT
animals (Fig. 3C). FITC-dextran–stained vasculature in the liver
served as a control for injection of the dyes.
We compared the growth of TRAMP-C2 tumors in VDR WT and
KO mice. Tumors were palpable around day 14 post-inoculation;
subsequently, tumor measurement was performed twice a week
(Fig. 3D). From day 18 to day 31, TRAMP-C2 tumors in KO mice
were larger than those in WT animals (P = 0.018).
Abnormal tumor vasculature in VDR KO mice is associated
with increased HIF-1A, VEGF, Ang1, and PDGF-B expression.
Angiogenesis is a process governed by complex signaling pathways
that promote endothelial cell proliferation and vascular maturation
(25). To determine if the observed differences in angiogenesis
between WT and KO tumors were related to dysregulation of
angiogenic signaling pathways, we examined hypoxia-induced
factor-1a (HIF-1a), VEGF, Ang1, and PDGF-B protein expression
from the tumor lysates. Tumors from VDR KO mice exhibited a
significantly higher level of HIF-1a protein when compared with
WT mice (P = 0.01) as measured by ELISA (Fig. 4A). There was a
significant increase in VEGF expression in tumors from KO mice
when compared with WT (Fig. 4B and E). No significant change
was observed in VEGF receptor 2 protein level between the two
groups (Fig. 4E). Higher expression of Ang1 (Fig. 4C and E) and
PDGF-BB (the dimer form) was also observed (Fig. 4D and E) in
tumors from VDR KO mice as compared with the WT counterpart.

Discussion
Calcitriol exerts profound antiproliferative effects on TDEC by
inducing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (8, 9). In TDEC,
treatment with calcitriol up-regulates VDR protein expression and
activates VDR signaling pathway (9). Using VDR KO mice, this
study shows that VDR plays a major role in calcitriol-mediated
antiproliferative effects in TDEC and in the development of tumor
angiogenesis in vivo. TDEC isolated from tumors implanted in VDR
WT, but not those from KO mice, showed enhanced VDR protein
expression and are growth-inhibited by calcitriol. Calcitriol
treatment induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in TDEC expressing
VDR but not VDR KO TDEC. In calcitriol-treated TDEC from VDR
KO mice, the lack of a luciferase signal from the promoter reporter
assay suggests that calcitriol-activated VDR may be involved in
regulating the transcription of various target genes governing cell
growth (31).
The absence of VDR in tumor-infiltrating vessels results in a
more aberrant vasculature. Compared with WT animals, the tumor
vessels in the KO mice are enlarged, are associated with fewer
pericytes and these tumors contain increased content of angiogenic factors such as HIF-1a, VEGF, Ang1, and PDGF-BB.
During rapid growth, tumor cells encounter hypoxic conditions
which result in the induction of HIF-1a (32). HIF-1a can act as a
transcriptional activator for various genes including VEGF (33).
VEGF is a potent endothelial cell growth factor and survival
molecule (34). Studies using transgenic VEGF mice and adenovirally mediated ectopic VEGF overexpression animal models revealed

Despite the high expression of VEGF observed in tumors of
VDR KO mice, our studies did not reveal a significant increase in
vascular permeability in these tumors. These findings could be
explained by the Ang1 overexpression in these tumors because
studies by others have shown that vessels stimulated by Ang1 are
resistant to plasma leakage (38). When both VEGF and Ang1 were
overexpressed at the same time, the leakage-resistance of the Ang1
phenotype seems to dominate (38, 42). Taken together, we conclude
that complete loss of VDR signaling results in aberrant angiogenic
signaling pathways in the tumor microenvironment.
We showed that tumor vessels in KO animals were covered with
fewer pericytes when compared with those in WT animals.

that excessive amounts of VEGF can result in enlarged and highly
permeable vascular beds (35, 36). Similarly, in mice overexpressing
Ang1, vessels were also dramatically enlarged compared with the
control mice (37, 38). Although Ang1 does not stimulate the
proliferation of endothelial cells (39), Ang1 could induce endothelial migration, tube formation, sprouting, and survival following
various apoptotic insults (40). Ang1 synergized with VEGF to
activate phosphoinositide-3-kinase and Akt signaling to promote
endothelial cell survival (41). Consistent with these studies, our
observation of significantly enlarged tumor vessels in VDR KO mice
may be attributed to the high level of VEGF and Ang1 within the
tumor microenvironment.

TRAMP tumors in VDR WT (y) and KO (o) mice. Vascular volume and permeability values were calculated from DR1 using linear regression analysis. Analysis of the
slopes showed a slight, but not significant difference in permeability between the two groups. Significant differences were seen between the vascular volumes
(Y-intercept) of tumors in VDR WT and KO mice (P < 0.001). B, modified in vivo Evans blue dye assay showed a significant increase in Evans blue dye content in
tumors from VDR KO compared to WT. Animals were given 0.2 mL of 0.5% Evans blue intracardiacally under anesthesia for 5 min before being sacrificed. The dye from
tumors was extracted using formamide, and readings were normalized with those from the livers. Data shown were from at least three to five animals per group.
C, confocal microscopy analysis shows a more extensive leakage of FITC-dextran from the tumor vasculature in VDR KO than in WT animals. Animals were given
0.2 mL of 2 Amol/L FITC-dextran in saline intracardically before fixation with paraformaldehyde. Livers were used as a control for sufficient systemic delivery of the dye.
Data shown were representative of three independent experiments. Scale bar, 200 Am. D, tumors in VDR KO mice were larger than those in WT mice. TRAMP cells
(2  106) were implanted subcutaneously into VDR WT (y) and KO (o) mice. The growth of the tumors, as measured by the tumor size, was monitored over time.
There were at least 4 to 6 animals per group, and the data shown is representative of two independent experiments.

BB, which promotes pericyte recruitment in a paracrine fashion
(43). Interestingly, ectopic PDGF-BB expression could disrupt
endothelial-pericyte interactions and may lead to abnormalities
in pericyte attachment and in vessel remodeling (43). In addition to
promoting pericyte recruitment, PDGF-BB induces intratumoral
lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis in the murine
fibrosarcoma model (44), promotes angiogenesis and glial tumorigenesis (45), and directly promotes the growth of prostate cancer
cells (46). In vitro and in vivo studies show that targeting this

Pericytes regulate endothelial cell proliferation, survival, migration,
and differentiation, and also modulate blood flow and vascular
permeability. It has been shown that lack of pericyte coverage may
represent a window of plasticity for further vessel remodeling (43).
Therefore, the vessels in VDR KO mice may be more responsive
to mitogenic and survival signals. However, the lower pericyte
coverage observed in VDR KO mice is contrary to the increase of
the pericyte-recruiting factor, PDGF-BB expression, in these
tumors. It has been shown that endothelial cells secrete PDGF-

The role of VDR signaling in the interactions among these cell
types and tumor cells in tumorigenesis remains to be elucidated. In
this model, we compared vasculature from the same tumor cells
grown in different VDR genetic backgrounds. The differences
of phenotype observed could be directly attributed to the VDR
activity in the host cells. Our studies provide in vivo molecular
evidence that calcitriol-VDR signaling has a substantial effect on
tumor angiogenesis and is required for the growth-inhibitory
effects on TDEC.

signaling pathway using PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(such as STI571), can enhance paclitaxel-mediated regression of
prostate tumors (47). Therefore, the enhanced PDGF-BB expression
within the TRAMP-C2 tumors in VDR KO mice may not only affect
pericyte recruitment but might also lead to increased neovascularization and tumor cell growth.
The role of VDR signaling in regulating these angiogenic
pathways is not well characterized. In various human cancer cells,
calcitriol inhibits HIF-1a protein expression and HIF-1a target
genes such as VEGF, endothelin-1, and glucose transporter-1 (48).
Furthermore, there are DR3 type vitamin D response element–like
sequences in the promoter region of the rat VEGF gene (48);
therefore, it is possible that calcitriol modulates VEGF expression
at the transcriptional level (49, 50). Whether Ang1 and PDGF-B
expression are also regulated through direct VDR-DNA interaction
remains to be elucidated. In calcitriol-treated TDEC WT cells, we
observed a reduction of VEGF, Ang1, and PDGF-BB expression but
this was not seen in TDEC KO cells. This model of TDEC, isolated
from different tumor microenvironments, will allow for a direct
examination of the role of VDR in mediating the effects of calcitriol
on angiogenic signaling pathways.
Our studies also contribute to the increasing evidence indicating
that host cells contribute to tumor growth. In addition to the
endothelial cells, there are other host cells present in the tumor
microenvironment, e.g., pericytes, stromal cells, and immune cells.
