BACKGROUND: The alpha v beta 3 (avb3) integrin is involved in intracellular signaling regulating cell proliferation,
migration, and differentiation and is important for tumor-induced angiogenesis. METHODS: This phase 2, randomized,
open-label, 2-arm study was designed to capture safety data and evaluate the antitumor efficacy of etaracizumab
(Abegrin), an IgG1 humanized monoclonal antibody against the avb3 integrin, in patients with previously untreated
metastatic melanoma. The objective was to evaluate whether etaracizumab  dacarbazine had sufficient clinical activity to warrant further study in a phase 3 clinical trial. RESULTS: One hundred twelve patients were randomized to
receive etaracizumab alone (N ¼ 57) or etaracizumab þ dacarbazine (N ¼ 55). Safety of etaracizumab  dacarbazine
was acceptable with infusion-related, gastrointestinal, and metabolic reactions being the most common adverse
events (AEs). The majority of AEs were grade 1 or 2 in severity in both study arms; most events were not considered
serious, except for cardiovascular (myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation) and thromboembolic events, which
occurred in 3 and 5 patients, respectively. None of the patients in the etaracizumab-alone study arm and 12.7% of
patients in the etaracizumab þ dacarbazine study arm achieved an objective response. The median duration of objective response in the etaracizumab þ dacarbazine study arm was 4.2 months. Stable disease rate, time to progression
(TTP), and progression-free survival (PFS) appeared to be similar between the 2 treatment arms. Stable disease
occurred in 45.6% of patients in the etaracizumab-alone study arm and 40.0% of patients in the etaracizumab þ
dacarbazine study arm. Median TTP and median PFS were both 1.8 months in the etaracizumab-alone study arm and
2.5 and 2.6 months in the etaracizumab þ dacarbazine study arm, respectively. Median overall survival was 12.6
months in the etaracizumab-alone study arm and 9.4 months in the etaracizumab þ dacarbazine study arm. CONCLUSIONS: The survival results in both treatment arms of this study were considered unlikely to result in clinically

Worldwide, cutaneous melanoma accounts for an estimated 160,000 new cases and 41,000 deaths annually.1 Median survival for patients with stage IV disease, based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) criteria, is 6
months to 10 months, with an estimated 5-year survival rate of 6%-10% for patients with advanced disease.2,3
Dacarbazine is the only US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of metastatic melanoma in current usage. Single-agent response rates range from 7% to 20% for dacarbazine but are
of short duration.4,5 Historically, the median survival of patients treated with dacarbazine alone in phase 3 randomized

studies is 6 months to 10 months.6-10 Interleukin-2 is an
immunotherapeutic agent approved for the treatment of
metastatic melanoma. Its multiorgan toxicity has limited
its utility, which has never been established in a phase 3
trial. No other agents or combinations have proved to be
more effective than single-agent dacarbazine.6-8,11-15
Etaracizumab (Abegrin or MEDI-522; MedImmune, Gaithersburg, Md) is an IgG1 humanized monoclonal antibody engineered from the murine monoclonal
LM609, an antibody directed against a conformational
epitope of alpha v beta 3 (avb3) integrin that is present on
the surface of certain types of invasive tumor cells, angiogenic endothelial cells, and mature osteoclasts.16
Although it is expressed at low levels in most normal tissues, avb3 integrin is highly expressed in certain malignancies, such as melanoma, late-stage glioma, and renal cell
carcinoma, as well as a limited number of cell types, such
as endothelial cells involved in angiogenesis and mature
osteoclasts involved in bone resorption.17-21 Preclinical
studies using avb3 antagonists have reported inhibition of
melanoma tumor growth independent of its antiangiogenic effects.22
Preclinical data suggest that a minimum continuous
trough concentration of 10-30 lg/mL of etaracizumab
induces in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity, including
inhibition of angiogenesis, direct inhibition of melanoma
tumor growth (ie, delay in tumor progression), and antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity of melanoma
cells independent of antiangiogenic activity. In human tissue cross-reactivity studies, etaracizumab binding was
detected mainly in endothelium, smooth muscle, selected
epithelial cells, and cells of the lamina propria.
Previous phase 1 studies demonstrated that the
safety profile of weekly etaracizumab at 8 mg/kg doses
was acceptable, and pharmacokinetics resulted in trough
concentrations shown in preclinical studies to be associated with biologic activity.23 In a phase 1 study of the saturation of avb3 by etaracizumab in patients with
metastatic melanoma that tested 1, 4, and 8 mg/kg, 8
mg/kg proved to be the optimal biologic dose.24 The
present phase 2 uncontrolled multicenter study was
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of
etaracizumab (8 mg/kg) alone or in combination with
dacarbazine, and to assess whether 1 of the 2 regimens
would merit further study. This report presents the
results of the study through 12 months postrandomization of the last patient plus approximately 2 years of
long-term follow-up.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
Patients eligible to enter the study were at least 18 years
old with histologically confirmed unresectable, stage IV
melanoma with at least 1 measurable lesion. Patients were
required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status of 0-1. Patients who had
prior adjuvant immunotherapy or surgery were eligible,
provided that therapy/surgery occurred at least 4 weeks
before randomization. Eligibility also required adequate
renal function (serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL), hepatic
function (bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase [AST]/alanine aminotransferase [ALT] 3 times the
upper limit of normal [ULN], alkaline phosphatase 3
times ULN), and bone marrow function (white blood cell
3000/mm3, absolute neutrophil count [ANC] 1500/
mm3, platelet count 100,000/mm3).
Patients were excluded if they had prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, or biologics for
metastatic melanoma. Concurrent therapy for cancer was
not allowed. Patients with known brain metastases or primary brain tumors, ocular melanoma, symptomatic pleural effusion, or ascites requiring paracentesis were also
excluded. Patients with any history or evidence of pulmonary embolism or thrombophlebitis (including deep-vein
thrombosis) requiring anticoagulant therapy (eg, warfarin
or heparin) or requiring therapeutic anticoagulation, as
well as patients with prior myocardial infarction or angina
or uncontrolled/refractory hypertension within 6 months
before randomization, were excluded.
Local institutional review boards approved the protocol, and patients provided written informed consent
before enrollment.

Treatment Plan
Patients were randomized using a 1:1 ratio to receive etaracizumab or etaracizumab þ dacarbazine with the following stratification factors: site of distant metastases (AJCC
Stage IV, M1a vs M1b vs M1c) and geographic region.
Patients randomized to the etaracizumab treatment arm
received etaracizumab weekly (8.0 mg/kg intravenous
[IV] over 30 minutes [5 minutes]). The duration of
each treatment cycle was 3 weeks, regardless of the number of etaracizumab doses administered, but could be
extended up to 5 weeks. Treatment cycles were repeated
until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or patient
withdrawal for any other reason. Patients randomized to
the etaracizumab þ dacarbazine study arm received the

Original Article

same weekly doses of etaracizumab followed by dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2 as a 60-minute IV infusion [10
minutes]) given once at Week 1 of every 3-week treatment
cycle. Dacarbazine was to be administered no earlier than
60 minutes (10 minutes) after the completion of the
etaracizumab infusion.
Efficacy Assessments
The antitumor activity primary endpoints were objective
tumor response rate, early disease progression rate, and
time to progression (TTP). Duration of objective
response, overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS) were secondary endpoints.
Tumor measurements were performed at screening
and after every 2 cycles of treatment until documentation
of disease progression. Tumor measurements were
repeated at least 4 weeks later in patients who achieved a
complete or partial response to treatment. Tumor assessments were based on Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors guidelines.25
Safety Profile Assessments
Safety profile endpoints included adverse events (AEs),
serious adverse events (SAEs), and changes in clinical
laboratory evaluations, vital signs, and urinalysis. Toxicity grading was based on NCI CTC 3.0.26 Routine laboratory screening and study tests included CBC with
differential, platelets, prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time, serum chemistries, and thyroxin and thyroid stimulating hormone (screening only).
Statistical Analyses
One of the primary endpoints was objective tumor
response, defined as either complete or partial response,
confirmed at least 4 weeks after the initial response. Other
primary endpoints were early disease progression rate,
defined as the proportion of patients with disease progression at the end of 2 treatment cycles, and TTP. Duration
of objective response, OS, and PFS were secondary endpoints. For patients without disease progression or death
due to disease before study end or start of alternative cancer therapy, TTP and duration of objective response were
censored on the last tumor assessment date. For patients
who had not progressed or died by the end of study, PFS
was censored on the last date patients were known to be
alive. OS was determined from the day of randomization
until death, or for surviving or lost-to-follow-up patients,
OS was censored on the last date patients were known to
be alive.

1528

For each of the TTP, duration of objective response,
PFS, and OS, the median and corresponding confidence
intervals (CIs) as well as plots of overall time-to-event distribution were obtained using Kaplan-Meier estimates.27
The effects of prognostic factors on OS were investigated
using the Cox proportional hazard regression27 with backward selection procedure. Significance testing was 2-sided
at the 0.05 level. Subgroup comparisons by baseline
patient characteristics (sex, age, ECOG performance status, and LDH ratio [baseline LDH/upper limit of laboratory-specific norm for LDH]) and stratification factors
(AJCC staging and geographic region) were explored for
the primary (objective tumor response, early disease progression rate, and TTP) and secondary (PFS and OS) endpoints. No formal statistical testing for the safety
endpoints were planned or performed. No power analysis
was performed for sample size determination. P values
and CIs reported in this article were not adjusted for multiple comparisons or multiple endpoints.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Disposition
A total of 112 patients with stage IV melanoma were enrolled between September 23, 2003, and May 20, 2004,
to receive etaracizumab alone (N ¼ 57) or etaracizumab
þ dacarbazine (N ¼ 55) at 23 sites in the United States
(20 sites), Australia (2 sites), and United Kingdom (1
site). Patient baseline characteristics are provided in Table
1. All but 2 patients (1 in each study arm) discontinued
treatment at 12 months after enrollment of the last
patient. The most common reason for discontinuation
was disease progression (etaracizumab alone, 46 of 56
[82.1%]; etaracizumab þ dacarbazine, 45 of 54 [83.3%]),
and AEs (etaracizumab alone, 7 of 56 [12.5%]; etaracizumab þ dacarbazine, 3 of 54 [5.6%]). One patient (1.9%)
in the etaracizumab þ dacarbazine study arm withdrew
consent, and 3 of 56 (5.4%) and 5 of 54 (9.3%) in the
etaracizumab-alone study arm and etaracizumab þ dacarbazine study arm, respectively, discontinued because of
other reasons (eg, physician decision, patient decision,
suspected progression, surgical intervention, adrenocortical adenoma). Three patient populations were analyzed
during this trial: intent-to-treat, evaluable, and safety
populations. All 112 patients (57 in the etaracizumabalone study arm and 55 in the etaracizumab þ dacarbazine study arm) were included in the intent-to-treat
and safety patient populations. The evaluable patient
population included 53 of 57 (93.0%) patients in the

Disease Response and TTP
Table 2 summarizes the disease response to etaracizumab
 dacarbazine in the intent-to-treat population as well as
PFS and OS. Disease responses were all partial and
observed in the etaracizumab þ dacarbazine treatment
group. Objective response was 12.7% (7 of 55) in the etaracizumab þ dacarbazine study arm and 0% in the etaracizumab study arm. Stable disease and early disease
progression rates as well as TTP were similar across the 2
treatment groups. Thus, stable disease, as best treatment
outcome during the study, occurred in 45.6% (26 of 57)
patients in the etaracizumab-alone study arm and 40.0%
(22 of 55) patients in the etaracizumab þ dacarbazine
study arm. Early disease progression rate was 47.4% in
the etaracizumab-alone study arm and 40.0% in the etaracizumab þ dacarbazine study arm.
Median time to progression was 1.8 months in the
etaracizumab-alone study arm and 2.5 months in the etaracizumab þ dacarbazine study arm. The median duration

1529

of objective response was 4.2 months in the etaracizumab
þ dacarbazine study arm. Similar results (objective tumor
response, early disease progression rate, time to progression, duration of objective response, duration of stable
disease) were observed for the evaluable patient population (data not shown).
PFS and OS
Kaplan-Meier estimates for PFS and OS for each treatment arm are presented in Table 2 and Figure 1. At a median follow-up of 11.2 months (range, 0.1-40.7), median
PFS was 1.8 months in the etaracizumab-alone study arm
and 2.6 months in the etaracizumab þ dacarbazine study
arm (Table 2). Median OS was 12.6 months in the etaracizumab-alone study arm and 9.4 months in the etaracizumab þ dacarbazine study arm (Table 2).
Results of subgroup analyses by baseline patient
characteristics showed that for both treatment arms,
females had longer median PFS and longer median OS
than males. Similarly, patients with ECOG performance
status of 0 had longer median OS than patients with
ECOG performance status of 1. In addition, LDH ratio
1.1 was associated with adverse PFS and OS outcomes.
The impact of prognostic factors such as age, gender,

1530

ECOG performance status, M classification, and LDH
ratio on OS was analyzed using Cox regression. Only
LDH ratio, M classification, and gender reached statistical
significance (P ¼ .0005, P ¼ .033, and P ¼ .015, respectively). On the basis of the hazard ratio estimates, it can be
concluded that patients with an LDH ratio 1.1 had
69.5% higher risk of death compared with patients with a
LDH ratio <1.1 (hazard ratio of 2.27 [95% CI, 1.433.61]), and patients with M1c melanoma had 60.8%
higher risk of death compared with patients with other M
classifications (hazard ratio of 1.55 [95% CI, 1.04-2.33]).
Also, male patients had 63.6% higher risk of death compared with female patients (hazard ratio of 1.75 [95% CI,
1.12-2.74]). Other factors that appeared to adversely
affect survival were lack of subsequent anticancer therapy
and increased length of time from initial diagnosis to
randomization.
Similar results (median PFS and OS time) were
observed for the evaluable patient population.
Safety Profile
The median number of treatment cycles was 2.0 in
the etaracizumab-alone study arm and 3.0 in the etaracizumab þ dacarbazine study arm up to 12 months after
the last patient was randomized. One of the 2 patients

Cancer

who remained on the study as of 12 months after the last
patient was randomized had received a total of 53 treatment cycles. The other patient discontinued treatment after a total of 39 cycles of treatment. At the completion of
the long-term follow-up (11.2 months; range, 0.1-40.7),
14% (8 of 57) of patients in the etaracizumab-alone study
arm and 7.3% (4 of 55) of patients in the etaracizumab þ
dacarbazine study arm were alive.
Table 3 summarizes the AEs that occurred in 6
patients (11%) in either treatment arm. The most frequently occurring AEs were infusion-related, gastrointestinal-related, or metabolic. Among the most common
events (occurring in 15 patients) reported by patients in
either the etaracizumab-alone study arm or etaracizumab
þ dacarbazine study arm were fatigue, nausea, hyperglycemia, chills, and anemia. Other commonly reported
events in the etaracizumab-alone study arm were pyrexia,
hypocalcemia, and diarrhea, and in the etaracizumab þ
dacarbazine study arm, thrombocytopenia, constipation,
leukopenia, and neutropenia. The majority of AEs in
both study arms was grade 1 or 2 in severity and was considered not serious. Table 4 summarizes the grade 3 AEs
that occurred in 2 patients (4%) in either treatment
arm. The most common grade 3 AEs occurring in
patients in the etaracizumab-alone study arm were fatigue
and pulmonary embolism. The most common grade 3
AEs occurring in patients in the etaracizumab þ dacarbazine study arm were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and
leukopenia, anemia, and lymphopenia, perhaps because
of the addition of dacarbazine.
Table 5 summarizes the major organ-associated
SAEs that occurred in any patient in the study. One
patient in the etaracizumab-alone study arm died of acute
myocardial infarction, and 1 patient in the etaracizumab
þ dacarbazine study arm died of pulmonary embolism.
Serious cardiac disorders occurred in 2 patients in the
etaracizumab-alone study arm and 1 patient in the etaracizumab þ dacarbazine study arm. In the etaracizumabalone study arm, these events included 1 each of grade 4
and 5 acute myocardial infarction judged as treatmentrelated. Grade 3 atrial fibrillation occurred in the etaracizumab þ dacarbazine study arm and was considered unrelated to treatment. Pulmonary embolism occurred in 3
patients in the etaracizumab-alone study arm and 1
patient in the etaracizumab þ dacarbazine study arm;
thrombosis occurred in 1 patient in the etaracizumabalone study arm. Each event was considered serious, but
only 1 pulmonary embolism event on each study arm was
judged as being treatment-related.

Hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 7 patients in
the etaracizumab-alone study arm and in 5 patients in the
etaracizumab þ dacarbazine study arm. Each reaction was
mild, and none of them resulted in treatment discontinuation. Gastrointestinal events (eg, diverticulum, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, rectal hemorrhage) occurred in 3
patients in the etaracizumab-alone study arm and 1
patient in the etaracizumab þ dacarbazine study arm.

Two events (upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage and gastrointestinal hemorrhage, each grade 3) were serious, but
neither event was considered treatment-related or
required treatment discontinuation. One event (grade 2
rectal hemorrhage) in the etaracizumab þ dacarbazine
study arm was considered possibly treatment-related.
Elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase, ALT,
AST, and blood glucose, as well as reduction of serum calcium, sodium, phosphate, and albumin levels were
observed at similar rates in patients on both treatment
arms.
The majority of AEs exhibited by the 2 patients who
remained on study as of 12 months after the last patient
was randomized was grade 1 or 2 in severity. The patient
in the etaracizumab-alone study arm reported SAEs of rib
fracture (grade 3), dyspnea (grade 3), cellulitis (grade 2),
anxiety (grade 3), and abdominal pain (grade 3). These
events were considered to be unrelated or remotely drugrelated (cellulitis). The patient in the etaracizumab þ
dacarbazine study arm reported SAEs of osteonecrosis
(grade 3) and catheter sepsis (grade 3); neither event was
considered to be etaracizumab-related.

DISCUSSION
We report the results of a randomized multicenter phase 2
study of etaracizumab in patients with stage IV melanoma. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive etaracizu-

mab (8 mg/kg/week) as a single agent or combined with
dacarbazine (1000 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks). The study
was designed to evaluate whether one of the regimens
warranted further phase 3 clinical study.
Etaracizumab  dacarbazine does not appear to be
more effective for treatment of metastatic melanoma than
historic experience with single-agent dacarbazine and
other inactive drugs.28 The median OS time of 12.6
months for the etaracizumab-alone study arm and 9.4
months for the etaracizumab þ dacarbazine study arm
appears comparable to historical data for dacarbazine
alone (6-10 months) in similar patient populations.6-10
The tumor response rate of 12.7% for etaracizumab þ
dacarbazine was also comparable to historical rates for
dacarbazine alone (10%-20%),4-8 but etaracizumab alone
showed no tumor response. Median PFS for the 2 treatment arms (1.8-2.6 months) are similar to historical data
for dacarbazine alone (1.5-2.3 months) in similar patient
populations.7,9,10
On the basis of the data from 70 phase 2 multicenter
cooperative group studies in 2100 patients analyzed by
Korn et al,28 median PFS was 1.7 months (95% CI, 1.61.8 months), median OS was 6.2 months (95% CI, 5.96.5 months), and 1-year survival was 25.5% (95% CI,

23.6%-27.4%). There are important differences in the
patient population of this study and the one presented by
Korn et al. Many of the patients analyzed by Korn et al28
had brain metastases and/or an ECOG performance status
of 2-3. Patients in the present study had a significantly
better median survival than patients analyzed the study by
Korn et al. Thus, the OS outcome at 1 year (40% in the
etaracizumab-alone study arm and 51% in the etaracizumab þ dacarbazine study arm) was initially viewed as
encouraging, although longer follow-up did not reveal
sustained differences, and the exclusion of patients with
an ECOG performance status of 2-3 and evidence of
brain disease may have contributed to the more optimistic
earlier findings.28
In general, ECOG performance status, LDH, M classification, age, and sex predicted survival in patients with
metastatic melanoma as shown in other studies.3,28,29
It is important to note that tumor response rate and
TTP/PFS in the etaracizumab þ dacarbazine study arm
did not correlate with improved survival. Tumor response
rate of 0% and shorter TTP/PFS for etaracizumab were
associated with the best survival in this study. Whether
this lack of concordance between the survival and
response rate is related to the capacity for biologics, like
bevacizumab, or small-molecule agents, like erlotinib and
sorafenib, to prolong PFS (erlotinib and sorafenib)30,31 or
OS (bevacizumab and sorafenib)31,32 without achieving
objective response, or because of variability in these outcomes that requires a larger sample size to be reliably
assessed, is presently uncertain.
The safety profile of etaracizumab  dacarbazine
was generally acceptable in this study. As expected in a
combination with dacarbazine, hematologic toxicity
occurred more frequently and with a higher severity with
etaracizumab þ dacarbazine than with etaracizumab
alone. The majority of AEs in either treatment arm were
considered not serious with the exception of myocardial
infarction in 2 patients, atrial fibrillation in 1 patient, and
thromboembolic events in 5 patients. These AEs have also
been reported with other antiangiogenic agents.33
The OS for both study arms was judged to be no different from many other inactive agents including dacarbazine; thus, further phase 3 study was not deemed to be
reasonable. Although further studies could explore
whether higher doses (>10 mg/kg) of etaracizumab alone
or in combination with dacarbazine may be more effective
in metastatic melanoma, at the present time, clinical development of etaracizumab has been interrupted until its
precise mechanism of action is understood.
