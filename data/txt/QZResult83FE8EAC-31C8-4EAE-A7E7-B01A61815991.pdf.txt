BACKGROUND: The combination of fish oil-derived docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (22:6; omega 3 [n-3]) and butyrate
(4:0), a fiber fermentation product, synergized to enhance colonocyte apoptosis by inducing a p53-independent, oxidation sensitive, mitochondrial Ca2þ-dependent (intrinsic) pathway. METHODS: In this study, the authors probed the
specificity of n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid induction of Ca2þ-dependent proapoptotic events in immortalized young adult mouse colonocytes and determined whether combinations of polyunsaturated fatty acid and butyrate could trigger endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress conditions, thereby promoting mitochondrial Ca2þ overload.
Cultures were treated with 0 lM to 50 lM of DHA (22:6; n-3), EPA (20:5; n-3), arachidoinic acid (AA) (20:4; n-6), linoleic acid (18:2; n-6), or oleic acid (OA) (18:1; n-9) for a total of 72 hours with or without RU-360 (to inhibit the mitochondrial Ca2þ uniporter) for 30 minutes before cotreatment with butyrate (0 mM or 5 mM). RESULTS: Combined
DHA and butyrate maximally induced apoptosis and mitochondrial-to-cytosolic Ca2þ levels. By comparison, EPA, a
precursor to DHA, was minimally effective. Similarly, AA and OA in combination with butyrate had no effect on mitochondrial Ca2þ or apoptosis compared with butyrate alone. DHA with or without butyrate cotreatment minimally
altered the ER stress-regulated genes DNA damage-inducible transcript 3, the CCAAT enhancer binding protein (C/
EBP) homologous protein (CHOP), and eukaryotic initiation factor 2a. CONCLUSIONS: The current data indicated
that butyrate and DHA, but not EPA, worked in a coordinated fashion to trigger an ER-independent, Ca2þ-dependent,

There is substantial experimental, epidemiological, and clinical evidence indicating that fish oil-containing diets rich

in omega 3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), eg, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (22:6D4,7,10,13,16,19) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (20:5D5,8,11,14,17), are protective against colon tumorigenesis.1-9 In a major recent finding, it was
demonstrated that EPA reduced rectal polyp numbers and size in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).10
Most impressive was the finding that fish oil-derived EPA suppressed FAP to a degree similar to that suppressed by the
selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor celecoxib. Collectively, these data indicate that n-3 PUFA holds promise as
a chemoprevention agent for FAP and sporadic colon cancer. In part as a consequence of these studies, fish oil is now being
promoted extensively in the unregulated nutraceutical sector. However, some of the fundamental aspects of n-3 PUFA
action need to be understood before it can be developed as a clinically viable cancer prevention therapy. These areas pertain to the mechanism of EPA and DHA action, which still has not been defined fully in molecular terms. Indeed, it is
becoming increasingly clear that these fatty acids have distinct biologic properties.11-13
The balance between proliferation and apoptosis is critical to the maintenance of steady-state numbers for cell populations in the colon. In general, dysregulation of this mechanism can disrupt homeostasis, resulting in clonal expansion,
with the resultant over production of affected cells.14,15 The enhancement of ‘‘targeted’’ apoptosis combined with the
reduced formation of DNA adducts during the initiation and late phases of tumorigenesis, in part, accounts for the

observed protective effect of n-3 PUFA against experimentally induced colon cancer.16-18 A very exciting outcome of our studies was the demonstration that the
pleiotropic, bioactive components generated by fermentable fiber (butyrate) and fish oil (DHA) work coordinately
to protect against colon tumorigenesis.5,19,20 Although it
has been well documented that butyrate is an inhibitor of
histone deacetylases and can activate the Fas receptormediated extrinsic death pathway,21,22 the role of these
mechanisms in the induction of colonocyte apoptosis may
be a secondary consequence of its ability to promote cellular oxidation.23 With respect to molecular triggers for apoptosis, Ca2þ is 1 of the most versatile and universal
signaling mediators in cells and is required for the activation of many cellular processes. Increasing evidence indicates that alterations in the finely tuned intracellular
homeostasis and compartmentalization of Ca2þ can lead
to cell death through either apoptosis or necrosis.24 Eukaryotic cells can increase their cytosolic Ca2þ levels by 2
mechanisms: release of Ca2þ from intracellular stores or
influx through plasma membrane channels. Although the
importance of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as the
major storage organelle is indisputable, growing evidence
indicates that functional compartmentalization of Ca2þ
exists within the various cellular organelles. Recent studies
have identified the contributions of the mitochondria in
maintaining intracellular Ca2þ homeostasis and cellular
physiologic function.25 Given the central role of mitochondria in the commitment to apoptosis, we demonstrated that DHA and butyrate interactively promote
apoptosis by triggering changes in mitochondrial Ca2þ
levels that contribute to caspase activation and colonocyte
cell death. For example, isogenic p53 wild-type and deficient human colon tumor cell lines as well as an immortalized mouse colonocyte line were used to demonstrate that
DHA modulates intracellular Ca2þ compartmentalization and store-operated channel (SOC) entry to induce
colonocyte apoptosis.26 These results corroborate previous observations19,27 and demonstrate that DHA and butyrate synergistically enhance both mitochondrial Ca2þ
accumulation and membrane lipid peroxidation, which
serve as triggers for apoptosis in a p53-independent
manner.28
In this study, we further probed the specificity of n6 and n-3 PUFA induction of Ca2þ-dependent proapoptotic events in immortalized colonocytes. In addition,
because ER stress-dependent apoptotic pathways can be
activated by fatty acids,29,30 we also determined whether
combinations of PUFA and butyrate trigger ER stress

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Two-well Lab-Tek chambered coverglass slides were purchased from Nunc, Inc. (Naperville, Ill). RPMI 1640 and
Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) were purchased
from Mediatech (Herndon, Va). Insulin, transferrin, and
selenium without linoleic acid were purchased from Collaborative Biomedical Products (Bedford, Mass). Fetal
bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from Hyclone (Logan,
Utah). Recombinant mouse interferon-c (IFN-c), Glutamax and Leibowitz media were purchased from GIBCO
BRL (Grand Island, NY). Fatty acids were obtained from
NuChek (Elysian, Minn). The Ca2þ-sensitive dyes Fluo4 AM and Rhod-2 AM were obtained from Molecular
Probes (Eugene, Ore). Soluble recombinant Fas:Fc was
purchased from BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes, NJ).
The mitochondrial Ca2þ inhibitor RU-360 was obtained
from Calbiochem (San Diego, Calif). The cell death
detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
kit was obtained from Roche Applied Science (Indianapolis, Ind). Sodium butyrate, immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1)
from human serum, and all other reagents were obtained
from Sigma (St. Louis, Mo). Stock solutions of Fluo-4,
AM (1 mM) and Rhod-2 (4 mM) were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted to 3.0 lM and 2.0
lM, respectively, for cell culture treatment (final concentration of the vehicle DMSO was maintained at 0.1%0.3% in culture). RU-360 (1 mM stock) was prepared in
degassed water and diluted in media to a final concentration of 10 lM.
Cell Cultures
Conditionally immortalized young adult mouse colonocytes (YAMCs) originally were obtained from R. H.
Whitehead at the Ludwig Cancer Institute (Melbourne,
Australia). These cells are immortalized by virtue of
expression of a temperature-sensitive simian virus 40
(SV40) large-T antigen.31 YAMCs were cultured in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% FBS, 1% insulintransferrin-selenium, 2 mM Glutamax, and 5000 U/L of
recombinant interferon c (IFN-c). Cells were cultured
under permissive conditions (33 C with IFN-c) or nonpermissive conditions (39 C), as described previously.26
For all fluorescence measurements, cells (12-18 passages)
were seeded onto borosilicate 2-chambered coverglass

slides at a density of 5  103 to 7  103 to achieve 50% to
70% confluence. For apoptosis assays, cells were seeded
onto 6-well plates at a density of 35  103. After 24 hours
of plating, select cultures were treated with 0 to 50 lM of
bovine serum albumin-complexed DHA (22:6; n-3), EPA
(20:5; n-3), arachidoinic acid (AA) (20:4; n-6), linoleic
acid (18:2; n-6), or oleic acid (OA) (18:1, n-9) for a total
of 72 hours, as described previously.26,28 In select experiments, cultures were preincubated with 0 lM or 10 lM
RU-360 in RPMI 1640 to inhibit the mitochondrial uniporter for 30 minutes before butyrate and fatty acid
cotreatment. In other experiments, cells were coincubated
with Fas:Fc or IgG1 (3 lg/mL) along with sodium butyrate for the final 24 hours of fatty acid pretreatment; then,
apoptosis and the mitochondrial-to-cytosol Ca2þ ratio
were measured.
Analysis of Mitochondrial Ca21
After a 24-hour fatty acid and butyrate treatment period,
cells were washed with serum-free Leibowitz media and
phenol red. Cells were then coincubated with 3 lM Fluo4 and 2 lM Rhod-2 for 1 hour at 33 C. Cultures were
washed subsequently with serum-free Leibowitz media,
and the mitochondrial-to-cytosolic Ca2þ ratio was measured. Quantification of Fluo-4 and Rhod-2 fluorescence
was performed by excitation at 488 nm and 550 nm,
respectively, and fluorescence emission was monitored at
530 nm and 580 nm, respectively, as described previously.26,28 The ratio of mitochondrial-to-cytosolic Ca2þ
was calculated. Data from 5 to 12 areas per well and from
at least 6 to 8 wells per treatment group were collected in
each experiment. Mitochondrial Ca2þ accumulation
observed by Rhod-2 fluorescence was corroborated by inhibiting the mitochondrial uniporter using RU-360 (10
lM) for 30 minutes before butyrate cotreatment. In addition, in previous experiments, MitoTracker, a mitochondrial targeting dye, was used to validate the subcellular
localization of Rhod-2 fluorescence.26
Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase
Polymerase Chain Reaction
Total RNA was isolated using the RNAqueous 4-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) isolation kit from Ambion
(Austin, Tex). The isolated total RNA subsequently was
treated with DNase to remove contaminating DNA.
RNA was reverse-transcribed to combinational DNA
using SuperScript II (Gibco BRL). Real-time PCR was
performed using the ABI 7900 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif). A predeveloped TaqMan gene expression

5296

assay for mouse the CCAAT enhancer binding protein
(C/EBP) homologous protein (CHOP) (NM-008929)
was obtained from Applied Biosystems.

Immunoblotting
Cell lysates from treated YAMCs were immunoblotted
with eukaryotic initiation factor 2a (eIF2a) or with phosphorylated eIF2a (phospho-eIF2a) antibody using the
method described by Davidson et al32 to evaluate protein
expression levels. Briefly, samples were treated with sodium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer and subjected to electrophoresis on a 4% to 20% precast Tris-glycine gel. After
electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes using a Hoefer Mighty
Small Transphor Unit (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) at
400 mA for 100 minutes. After transfer, membranes were
incubated with rabbit anti-eIF2a (9722) or rabbit antiphospho-serine 51 (Ser51)-eIF2a (9721; Cell Signaling,
Danvers, Md) antibody overnight at 4 C, followed by
peroxidase-labeled goat-antirabbit IgG incubation for 1
hour at room temperature. Bands were detected using
Super Signal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate
(Pierce, Rockford, Ill), and the blots were scanned using a
Bio-Rad Fluor-S Max MultiImager System (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, Calif).

Cell Death Assay
Apoptosis was determined using nucleosomal fragmentation ELISA (Roche Applied Science). Floating cells were
harvested, washed, lysed, and centrifuged to sediment
nuclei. The supernatant containing mononucleosomes
and oligonucleosomes was incubated with substrate and
analyzed by ELISA. Absorbance values were measured at
405 nm and subsequently were normalized to the number
of adherent cells per dish, as described previously.22 To
determine the association between the mitochondrial-tocytosolic Ca2þ ratio and apoptosis, select cultures were
preincubated with RU-360 (10 lM) for 30 minutes
before butyrate exposure. Cells were washed and treated
with 5 mM butyrate, and apoptosis was measured after a
24-hour incubation period. In addition, the association
between the extrinsic pathway and apoptosis was determined by coincubating select cultures in Fas:Fc or IgG1
with sodium butyrate for the final 24 hours. In complimentary apoptosis experiments, adherent cells and
floating cells were harvested, washed, pelleted by centrifugation, and lysed.

Figure 1. The induction of apoptosis by fatty acid and butyrate cotreatment is illustrated. Young adult mouse colonocytes
were treated with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (50 lM), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), arachidonic acid (AA), or oleic
acid (OA) for a total of 72 hours and with 0 mM or 5 mM butyrate for the final 24 hours. Nonadherent cells were harvested, and apoptosis was measured by using a nucleosomal
fragmentation assay. C indicates control (no fatty acid or butyrate); B, butyrate only; DB, DHA and butyrate; EB, EPA and

control cells. Data are from 6 to 12 wells per treatment from 2

that were treated with fatty acid (50 lM for 72 hours). D indicates DHA only; E, EPA only; A, AA only; O, OA only.

Statistical Analysis
The effect of independent variables (treatment effects)
was assessed using the SuperAnova software package (Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkeley, Calif). Differences among
means were determined using t/F-type tests of contrast. P
values < .05 were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
The findings in Figure 1 indicate that butyrate alone as
well as EPA (n-3 PUFA), AA (n-6 PUFA; control), and
OA (n-9; monounsaturated control) in combination with
butyrate significantly (P < .05) enhanced apoptosis
(80%) compared with untreated control cells. By comparison, DHA and butyrate maximally enhanced apoptosis (170%) compared with untreated control cells. Fatty
acid treatment alone had no effect on the apoptotic index
(Fig. 1, inset). The levels of butyrate and fatty acid are
considered physiologically relevant because they lie within
the range present in the colonic lumen33 and blood,34

tracellular calcium levels, the combination of EPA and butyrate modestly (8%) increased (P < .05) the
mitochondrial-to-cytosolic Ca2þ ratio compared with
untreated control cells (Fig. 2). By comparison, the combination of DHA and butyrate maximally induced (47%)
mitochondrial-to-cytosolic Ca2þ levels compared with
untreated control cells. The results indicated in the Figure
2 inset indicate that that fatty acid treatment alone had no
effect on intracellular Ca2þ homeostasis.
Having established that both DHA and EPA, when
combined with butyrate, perturb intracellular Ca2þ homeostasis, we subsequently investigated the ability of an
inhibitor of the mitochondrial Ca2þ uniporter RU36028
to suppress the induction of apoptosis. In addition,
because Fas receptor signaling transduction is involved in
butyrate induction of apoptosis in colonocytes,22 we
investigated how YAMCs would respond when cultured
with antagonistic soluble Fas:Fc. Figure 3A indicates that

coincubated with either combined fatty acid plus 5 mM butyrate (DBR treatment) or with combined DHA, butyrate, and Fas inhibitor (3 lg/mL Fas:Fc) for an additional 24 hours (DBRF treatment). Select cultures that were not pretreated with RU-360
were coincubated with fatty acid, butyrate, and Fas:Fc (DBF treatment). Nonadherent cells were harvested, and nucleosomal

from 2 separate experiments. Inset: The apoptotic index is illustrated in cells that were treated with 5 mM butyrate alone (B);

Mitochondrial-to-cytosolic Ca2þ levels are illustrated in cells that were treated with butyrate (B), RU-360 (BR), Fas:Fc (BF), or

RU-360 partially blocked DHA, and butyrate induced
apoptosis, whereas Fas:Fc had no effect. The combination
of RU-360 and Fas:Fc partially reversed the proapoptotic
effect of the DHA and butyrate (DB) combination. In
contrast, combined treatment with Fas:Fc and RU-360
(DBRF) did not produce any significant difference in apoptosis compared with RU-360 treatment alone (DBR).
In cells that were not exposed to fatty acid (Fig. 3A, inset),
the results indicated that butyrate enhanced apoptosis
compared with untreated control cells (C). Fas:Fc alone
(BF) and the combination of RU-360 þ Fas:Fc (BRF)
completely blocked the butyrate-induced increase in apoptosis in the absence of fatty acid treatment. In contrast,
RU-360 alone had no effect on butyrate-induced apoptosis. The results illustrated in Figure 3B demonstrate that
DHA and butyrate cotreatment significantly increased
mitochondrial-Ca2þ accumulation compared with
untreated control cells. Fas:Fc (DBF) had no effect on mitochondrial-to-cytosolic Ca2þ levels compared with DBtreated cells. RU-360-pretreated cultures (DBR and

5298

DBRF) exhibited significant reductions (P < .05) in mitochondrial-to-cytosolic Ca2þ levels, as expected. In cells
that were not exposed to fatty acid (Fig. 3B, inset), Fas:Fc
treatment (BF and BRF) reduced mitochondrial-to-cytosolic Ca2þ levels. In contrast, RU-360 alone (BR) had no
effect on mitochondrial-Ca2þ accumulation, consistent
with the lack of an effect of butyrate on intracellular Ca2þ
homeostasis.26
We previously demonstrated that the immortalized
YAMC cell line is a good model system in which to examine bioactive chemoprotective properties with respect to
apoptosis.19,22,34 In comparative experiments examining
EPA, RU-360 partially blocked EPA, and butyrate
induced apoptosis, whereas Fas:Fc had no effect (Fig. 4A).
The combination of RU-360 þ Fas:Fc partially reversed
the proapoptotic effect of the EPA and butyrate (EB)
combination. In contrast, combined Fas:Fc and RU-360

(EBR). In cells that were not exposed to fatty acid or

incubated with RU-360 (10 lM) for 30 minutes to inhibit mitochondrial Ca2þ uptake. Cells that were pretreated with RU-360
were rinsed and subsequently coincubated with EPA and butyrate only (5 mM) (EBR treatment) or with combined EPA, butyrate,

Ru-360 combined with Fas:Fc) had no effect on apoptosis
compared with untreated control cells. An analysis of mitochondrial-to-cytosolic Ca2þ ratios after EPA treatment
is illustrated in Figure 4B. The EPA and butyrate combination significantly (P < .05) enhanced mitochondrialto-cytosolic Ca2þ levels, which were inhibited by RU-360
(EBR) and combined Fas:Fc and RU-360 (EBRF). In
contrast, Fas:Fc treatment in the absence of RU-360
(EBF) had no effect on mitochondrial-to-cytosolic Ca2þ
accumulation. The inset in Figure 4B indicates that, for
cells that were treated with RU-360 (CR), Fas:Fc (CF), or
combined RU-360 and Fas:Fc (CRF) in the absence of
fatty acid and butyrate, only RU-360 and Fas:Fc treatment (CRF) reduced mitochondrial-to-cytosolic Ca2þ
levels compared with untreated control cells.
Because Ca2þ is stored in the ER, and ER stress
increases Ca2þ transfer to mitochondria, thereby amplifying the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK)eIF2a-activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)-CHOP
pathway,36 we also examined the effect of fatty acid and
butyrate treatment on ER stress-regulated genes. Both bu-

tyrate alone and butyrate-fatty acid combinations modestly increased CHOP messenger RNA expression relative
to basal untreated control cells (Fig. 5). Thapsigargin, an
inhibitor of sarco/ER Ca2þ-ATPase (SERCA) activity
that is known to induce ER stress, was used as a positive
pharmacologic control.26,37 An examination of the ER
stress protein phosphorylation (P-eIF2a) revealed no
induction of the ER stress response (Fig. 6). Collectively,
these data suggest that the proapoptotic synergy between
DHA and butyrate involving mitochondrial Ca2þ loading
is not mediated by ER stress.

DISCUSSION
An important outcome of our previous studies was the
demonstration that the antitumorigenic effect of fish oil
(n-3 PUFA) is enhanced when a highly fermentable fiber
or its fermentation product-butyrate is added to the
diet.4,18-20,38 This chemopreventive effect is mediated in
part by the up-regulation of targeted apoptosis of DNA
adducts during tumor initiation16,27 and spontaneous apoptosis during promotion.39 With respect to a mechanism
of action, pectin is metabolized by bacteria within the

lumen of the gut to generate millimolar levels of butyrate
and other short-chain fatty acids.32 We recently demonstrated that the combination of DHA and butyrate, compared with DHA or butyrate alone, further enhanced
colonocyte apoptosis by inducing a p53-independent, oxidation-sensitive, mitochondrial Ca2þ-dependent (intrinsic) pathway.26,28 Our results using YAMCs are consistent
with data generated using the human colon cancer cell
line HCT116 as well as mouse and rat azoxymethane in
vivo models.4,19,20,26,28 Therefore, similar results are
observed when neoplastic cells are used. Collectively, these
data indicate that highly fermentable fiber, which generates butyrate in the colon, only has chemotherapeutic
value when n-3 PUFA is the lipid source. This critical observation emphasizes the need to examine both the lipid
and fiber composition of diets.
To further elucidate specifically which dietary n-3
PUFA in combinations with fermentable fiber up-regulate apoptosis effector mechanisms in colonocytes, we
contrasted the ability of EPA, AA, or OA versus DHA in
combination with butyrate to synergistically induce apoptosis. Specifically, n-6 and n-3 PUFAs were examined
with respect to apoptogenic mitochondrial Ca2þ overloading and ER stress. We report that the combination of
DHA and butyrate maximally induced apoptosis and mitochondrial-to-cytosolic Ca2þ levels. By comparison,
EPA, a precursor to DHA, was minimally effective. Similarly, AA (20:4; n-6) and OA (18:1; n-9) in combination
with butyrate had no effect on mitochondrial Ca2þ levels
or apoptosis compared with butyrate alone. RU-360, a
mitochondrial-uniporter inhibitor, abrogated mitochondrial-to-cytosolic Ca2þ accumulation and also partially
blocked apoptosis in DHA and butyrate cotreated cells.
Collectively, these data indicate that only the combination
of DHA and butyrate, compared with fatty acid or butyrate alone, synergistically enhances apoptosis by also
recruiting a Ca2þ-mediated, intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. Data from these experiments extend observations in
human cell lines and rat colonic crypt cultures.28 Because
butyrate is capable of inducing colonocyte apoptosis
through a nonmitochondrial, Fas-mediated, extrinsic
pathway,22,26 we also examined the effect of a CD95 (Fas
receptor) antagonist. Fas:Fc blocked apoptosis in cultures
that were incubated with butyrate alone, as expected.
However, this antagonist did not block mitochondrial-tocytosolic Ca2þ accumulation and apoptosis in cells that
were treated with combined DHA and butyrate.
Because select fatty acids can regulate cell death by
inducing ER stress in several cell types,29,30 we examined

whether a PUFA/butyrate combination regimen activates
ER stress responses in colonocytes. Intriguingly, we produced little evidence that DHA and butyrate cotreatment
increases ER stress-regulated genes, CHOP and eIF2a.
This is in contrast to results from a previous report in
which the cytotoxic effect of DHA was associated with signaling pathways involving ER stress.30 In those studies,
DHA was added in ethanol at a higher concentration (70
lM) to the colon cancer cell line SW620. Treatment of
these cells leads to the accumulation of numerous, large
lipid droplets, which probably is cytoxic.30 To avoid artifacts related to fatty acid oxidation and toxicity, we routinely complex fatty acids to albumin, a physiologically
relevant delivery modality for long-chain PUFA use in
culture.40
Acquired resistance to apoptosis is a common defect
associated with tumor cells and represents a critical obstacle for therapy.14,41 Therefore, the elucidation of novel
apoptotic triggers constitutes an important objective in
the effort to develop therapies. It is important to note that
chemopreventive interventions using drugs have raised
safety concerns. For example, the long-term use of COX2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDS) is not feasible because of associated cardiovascular risk.42,43 This has dampened enthusiasm for their
extensive use as cancer chemopreventive therapies. Safety
problems intrinsic to drugs administered over long periods of time strengthen the interest in diet-related cancer
chemoprevention approaches. Therefore, the search for
toxicologically innocuous dietary interventions is timely
and propitious, and foodstuffs that provide both DHA
and butyrate-generating, fermentable fiber provide an
attractive alternative.
In summary, we have demonstrated that the pleiotropic bioactive components generated by fermentable
fiber (butyrate) and fish oil (DHA but not EPA) work in a
coordinated fashion to trigger a Ca2þ-dependent, intrinsic mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic pathway in colonocytes. This finding is significant, because n-3 PUFA1,6,8
and butyrate20,41,44,45 reduce the risk of colon cancer in
humans and appear to be suited ideally as a new generation of nontoxic chemotherapeutics to work either alone
or in combination with chemoprotective drugs, eg,
NSAIDs, whose long-term use is contraindicated.43
Given the critical nature of apoptosis in colon cancer prevention, and because the inhibition of apoptosis is an integral component in the genesis of colon cancer, it is
imperative to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which
n-3 PUFA and butyrate promote apoptosis in the colon.
