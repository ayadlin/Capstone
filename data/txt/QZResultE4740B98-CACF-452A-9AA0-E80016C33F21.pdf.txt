Abstract
Activating BRAF kinase mutations arise in f7% of all human
tumors, and preclinical studies have validated the RAF–
mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase–ERK signaling cascade as a potentially
important therapeutic target in this setting. Selective RAF
kinase inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical development, and based on the experience with other kinase-targeted
therapeutics, it is expected that clinical responses to these
agents, if observed, will lead to the eventual emergence of
drug resistance in most cases. Thus, it is important to
establish molecular mechanisms underlying such resistance
to develop effective therapeutic strategies to overcome or
prevent drug resistance. To anticipate potential mechanisms
of acquired resistance to RAF inhibitors during the course of
treatment, we established drug-resistant clones from a human
melanoma-derived cell line harboring the recurrent V600E
activating BRAF mutation, which exhibits exquisite sensitivity
to AZ628, a selective RAF kinase inhibitor. We determined that
elevated CRAF protein levels account for the acquisition of
resistance to AZ628 in these cells, associated with a switch
from BRAF to CRAF dependency in tumor cells. We also found
that elevated CRAF protein levels may similarly contribute to
primary insensitivity to RAF inhibition in a subset of BRAF
mutant tumor cells. Interestingly, AZ628-resistant cells demonstrating either primary drug insensitivity or acquired drug
resistance exhibit exquisite sensitivity to the HSP90 inhibitor
geldanamycin. Geldanamycin effectively promotes the degradation of CRAF, thereby revealing a potential therapeutic
strategy to overcome resistance to RAF inhibition in a subset
of BRAF mutant tumors. [Cancer Res 2008;68(12):4853–61]

Introduction
Genetic alterations that contribute to tumorigenesis can give rise
to proteins that are essential for maintaining the enhanced growth
and survival properties of tumor cells. Such ‘‘addiction’’ to
individual oncogenic proteins seems to explain the exquisite
clinical sensitivity of some tumors to various molecularly targeted
kinase inhibitors (1). Thus, imatinib is highly effective in chronic

myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells that harbor the BCR-ABL
translocation and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) with
activating c-KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor
mutations (2). Similarly, most non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC)
harboring an activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
kinase domain mutation are sensitive to the selective EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) gefitinib and erlotinib (3–5).
As a result of cancer genome resequencing efforts, activating
somatic mutations in BRAF have been identified in 60% of
melanomas, 40% of thyroid cancers, and 20% of colon cancers (6).
The most common BRAF mutation leads to a substitution of
glutamic acid for valine at position 600 (V600E) within the
activation segment of the BRAF kinase domain, which results in
elevated kinase activity and stimulation of downstream mitogenactivated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
kinase (MEK)–ERK signaling, consequently promoting tumor cell
survival and proliferation (6–8). Therefore, inhibition of the BRAF
pathway is considered to be a promising strategy for treating
melanoma and other BRAF mutant cancers, and several selective
kinase inhibitors that target the BRAF-MEK-ERK pathway are
currently being developed (9, 10). In preclinical studies, inhibition
of the MEK kinase effectively and specifically inhibits the growth of
human tumor cell lines harboring activating BRAF mutations (9).
Similarly, in a high-throughput tumor cell line profiling study, we
have recently reported that AZ628, a selective and potent
investigational small molecule RAF kinase inhibitor, is remarkably
effective at inhibiting the growth of a specific subset of human
cancer cell lines derived from melanomas, thyroid cancers, and
colorectal cancers that harbor the BRAF V600E mutation (11).
Whereas various targeted kinase inhibitors have shown both
preclinical and clinical activity, the application of these agents to
large patient populations has clearly shown that, whereas initial
clinical responses can be dramatic, rapid acquisition of drug
resistance is a major limitation to the overall therapeutic efficacy of
these drugs. Therefore, one of the major challenges associated with
the broader use of these inhibitors is the elucidation of drug
resistance mechanisms and the development of strategies to
overcome or prevent resistance.
In CML, GIST, and NSCLC, acquired resistance to kinase
inhibitors is frequently associated with either secondary kinase
domain mutations, amplification of the gene encoding the target
kinase, or mutational activation of genes encoding components of
alternative survival pathways (12–18). Notably, each of these
identified resistance mechanisms has been successfully modeled
in cell culture using appropriate drug-treated cancer cell lines,
indicating that such cell culture modeling can provide an effective
system for identifying mechanisms of acquired drug resistance that
are likely to arise clinically (16, 19, 20). This is important because

will generally require considerable time, first requires the
identification of relevant resistance mechanisms. Therefore, the
ability to anticipate clinical mechanisms of acquired resistance to
targeted kinase inhibitors is likely to greatly accelerate the
development of strategies to overcome or prevent acquired drug
resistance (21) and to reduce the current temporal gap between
initial clinical successes and subsequent disease progression in the
absence of available secondary treatment options.
Selective inhibitors of the RAF and MEK kinases are currently
undergoing early-phase clinical testing (22–24). To anticipate
potential mechanisms of acquired resistance to RAF inhibitors
that could arise during the course of treatment, we established
drug-resistant clones from a human melanoma-derived cell line
that harbors the V600E activating BRAF mutation and exhibits
exquisite sensitivity to AZ628, a selective RAF kinase inhibitor. In a
subset of these clones, significantly increased expression of the
BRAF-related CRAF protein seems to account for the acquisition of
resistance to AZ628. Interestingly, the resistant clones, which have
shifted their dependency from BRAF to CRAF, acquire substantial
sensitivity to the HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin. Geldanamycin
effectively promotes the degradation of CRAF, thereby revealing a
potential therapeutic strategy to overcome this resistance mechanism.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents. The human melanoma cell line M14
expressing the V600E BRAF mutation was kindly provided by Daphne Bell
(NIH). M14 is a cell line from the NCI-60 cell line panel that has been
extensively characterized (25). Cells were maintained at 37jC in a humidified
atmosphere at 5% CO2 grown in RPMI 1640 (Cellgro; Mediatech, Inc.)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 IU/mL penicillin,
100 Ag/mL streptomycin, and 2 nmol/L glutamine. AZ628 resistant M14
clones were maintained in the above-mentioned medium and 2 Amol/L of
AZ628, except where otherwise indicated. The BRAF inhibitor AZ628 was
synthesized by Astra Zeneca. It shows IC50 values of f30 nmol/L for BRAF
V600E and wild-type CRAF and 100 nmol/L for wild-type BRAF and strong
selectivity for RAF kinases among a panel of 150 tested kinases.3 Additional
details regarding the structure and properties of AZ628 will be reported
separately. The MEK inhibitor U0126 was purchased from Promega.
Geldanamycin was acquired from Biomol International. The additional
inhibitors were either obtained from the MGH pharmacy or were synthesized at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute based on published structures.
Cellular proliferation assay. Approximately 50,000 or 25,000 cells were
seeded in 12-well or 24-well plates, respectively, in medium supplemented
with 5% FBS. After overnight incubation, the cells were treated with various
concentrations of each drug. Fresh medium and drug were replaced every
2 d until the untreated control wells reached confluence. At this time point,
the media were removed and the cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS
(Boston Bioproducts) for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were then
washed twice with PBS and stained with a 1:5,000 solution of the fluorescent
nucleic acid stain Syto60 (Molecular Probes). Quantitation of fluorescent
signal intensity was carried out at 700 nm using an Odyssey IR Imager
(Li-Cor Biosciences). Each experiment was performed in quadruplicate, and
the results shown represent the average of the four values compared with
untreated wells. Error bars represent SD of the four values from the mean.
High-throughput cell growth/viability assays were performed as previously
reported (11).
Protein detection. To collect protein lysates, cells were washed with
PBS, scraped in lysis buffer (150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP40, 50 mmol/L Tris,
2 mmol/L EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 Ag/mL each of aprotinin, leupeptine, and

14,000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatant was collected. Protein
concentration was measured with the bicinchoninic acid protein assay
(Pierce), and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gels were
electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybond-P,
Amersham). Antibody detection was performed with a chemiluminescence
kit (Supersignal, Pierce). The ERK1/2, phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2;
T202/Y204), MEK, and ARAF antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology.
The CRAF and BRAF antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All
antibodies were used at a 1:1,000 dilution.
Generation of AZ628-resistant M14 clones. Approximately, 105 M14
cells were plated in each of three 10-cm dishes. After overnight incubation,
the medium was removed and fresh medium was added, together with
AZ628 at 2 Amol/L. Fresh medium containing drug was added to the cells
every 3 d. Five weeks after drug selection, f10 clones per dish appeared.
Two to three clones per dish were isolated using cloning cylinders and
propagated progressively in 3-cm, 6-cm, and 10-cm dishes maintained in

2 Amol/L AZ628. All of the clones were confirmed to be resistant to AZ628
in a follow-up cell proliferation assay with Syto60 staining and quantitation.
DNA sequencing. Genomic DNA was isolated from the M14 parental cell
line and AZ628-resistant clones using the Gentra purification system
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. BRAF was amplified from
genomic DNA by PCR. PCR products were purified using exonuclease I
and shrimp alkaline phosphatase (U.S. Biochemical) followed by bidirectional sequencing using BigDye v1.1 (Applied Biosystems) in combination
with an ABI3100 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Primers used for
sequencing of BRAF are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Electropherograms were analyzed using Sequence Navigator software (Applied
Biosystems). All mutations were confirmed by at least two independent
PCR amplifications.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization. Two-color fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) was performed on 3:1 methanol-acetic acid fixed cell
lines using the following probes, according to the manufacturer’s protocols:
SpectrumOrange–labeled CRAF (BAC clones RP11-148M13 and CTD2163C15, 3p25.1) and BRAF (BAC clones RP11-1065D4 and CTD-2516J12,
7q34), SpectrumGreen–labeled control probe for CRAF (BAC RP11-36I6,
3q13.2), and SpectrumAqua–labeled centromeric probe for chromosome 7
(Vysis) that serves as a control probe for BRAF. Images were captured using
an Olympus BX61 fluorescent microscope equipped with a CCD camera,
and analysis was performed with Cytovision software (Applied Imaging).
Short hairpin RNA constructs and lentiviral infection. Two short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) species targeting sequences for BRAF and two for
CRAF were expressed from the pLKO.1 lentiviral vector (BRAF target
sequences, 5¶GCAGATGAAGATCATCGAAAT3¶ and 5¶CAGCAGTTACAAGCCTTCAAA3¶; CRAF target sequences, 5¶CATGAGTATTTAGAGGAAGTA3¶
and 5¶GCTTCCTTATTCTCACATCAA3¶). Cells were inoculated in 96-well
plates and 6-cm dishes and incubated for 16 h until cells reach f80%
confluency. Cells were then infected with shRNA lentiviruses or control
vector (PLKO.1) in the presence of polybrene 8 Ag/mL (hexadimethrine
bromide, Sigma-Aldrich) under 1,200  g gravity at 32jC for 60 min. Under

this condition, f5 multiplicity of infection efficiency was achieved. After
infection, cells were maintained in the presence of 2 Ag/mL of puromycin
(Invitrogen) for an additional 4 to 6 d. A cell line resistant to
pharmacologic RAF inhibition (A549) was used to show infection efficiency
and specificity.
Quantitative PCR. Total RNA was isolated from M14 and M14BRR2 cells
using RNeasy kit (QIAGEN). One-step reverse transcription and real-time
PCR was performed using FastLane Cell kit (QIAGEN). The amount of CRAF
amplicons was determined using the AB7500 quantitative PCR (qPCR)
system (Applied Biosystems) with SYBR Green I as the fluorescence reporter
dye and ROX as the passive reference dye. The amount of glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase amplicons was determined similarly using
QuantiTect primers (QIAGEN). The qPCR thermal profile was 50jC for
30 min for cDNA synthesis, 95jC for 15 min for hot-start activation of the
antibody-neutralized DNA polymerase, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation (94jC, 15 s), annealing (60jC, 30 s), and elongation/data acquisition
(72jC, 35 s). After completion of the thermal cycling, PCR product melting
curves were obtained using the standard protocol of the AB7500 system.
The C t values were determined using manual settings recommended by the
manufacturer of the FastLane reagent.
All specimens were analyzed in triplicate. CRAF primers used are as
follow: forward 1 5¶GCACGGAGATGTTGCAGTAA3¶, reverse 1 5¶GCTACCAGCCTCTTCATTGC; forward 2 5¶CTGTTTCCAGGATGCCTGTT, reverse 2
5¶GCTACTGGACAGGGCTGAAG.
CRAF expression construct. The CRAF 22W cDNA coding sequence
within a pBABE retrovirus plasmid was a kind gift from Channing Der
(University of North Carolina; ref. 26). Transfection of Phoenix Morpho cells
with the retroviral vector was performed using the Fugene Transfection
Reagent (Invitrogen). The collected retrovirus was used to infect M14 cells
in the presence of polybrene (8 Ag/mL) under 1,200  g gravity at 32jC for
60 min. Cells were selected in puromycin (2 Ag/mL), and resistant clones
were used for analysis. M14 cells infected with an empty pBABE puro
plasmid were used as control.

Results
Generation of melanoma cell line clones with acquired
resistance to the RAF kinase inhibitor AZ628. To identify
potential mechanisms of acquired resistance to a selective RAF
kinase inhibitor, we used the M14 human melanoma-derived cell
line. These cells harbor the V600E BRAF mutation and are
exquisitely sensitive to the potent and selective RAF inhibitor
AZ628 (11). Five weeks after continuously exposing M14 cells to
2 Amol/L AZ628, a concentration that rapidly promotes growth
inhibition and cell death in the vast majority of treated cells, single
cell–derived drug-resistant clones emerged at a frequency of f1 in
104 cells. Six of these clones were isolated and expanded for further
characterization.
Morphologically, the M14-derived AZ628 resistant (M14BRR)
clones are flat and epithelial-like when compared with the parental
M14 cell line (Supplementary Fig. S1). Their growth properties are
otherwise indistinguishable from the parental cells. A drug
titration assay of cell viability showed that AZ628-resistant clones
are f100-fold more resistant to AZ628 than the parental cell line,
exhibiting an IC50 of f10 Amol/L compared with 0.1 Amol/L for

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (12). June 15, 2008

the parental cell line (Fig. 1A). Similar results were observed with
an alternative RAF-selective inhibitor that is currently undergoing
clinical development (data not shown). DNA sequence analysis of
the AZ628-resistant clones excluded the presence of any
secondary mutations in BRAF, a potential mechanism reported
to contribute to acquired resistance to other kinase inhibitors
in other tumor types (12–14). Furthermore, the presence of
the V600E activating BRAF mutation in the resistant clones
(not shown) confirmed that they had not arisen from a
contaminating subpopulation of cells.
Resistance to AZ628 is associated with elevated levels of the
RAF downstream effector p-ERK1/2. To further investigate the
mechanism underlying acquired AZ628 resistance in these cells, we
performed immunoblotting studies of established RAF downstream
effectors in the parental cell line and the resistant clones (Fig. 1B).
In three of the resistant clones (M14BRR2, M14BRR5, and
M14BRR8), basal activation of the downstream effector ERK1/2
was significantly increased relative to levels seen in the parental
cell line. Therefore, we hypothesized that ERK1/2 might play a
pivotal role in the mechanism of acquired resistance to AZ628, in at

least a subset of cases, and these three resistant clones were further
characterized.
We next compared the effect of AZ628 treatment on
RAF-dependent signaling on the M14 cells and drug-resistant
derivatives. As we have previously reported, sensitivity to AZ628 is
correlated with suppression of the downstream effector p-ERK1/2
after treatment of various melanoma-derived cell lines harboring
BRAF activating mutations (11). Effective suppression of p-ERK1/2
levels was observed in the M14 parental cell line after treatment
with increasing concentrations of AZ628. In contrast, p-ERK1/2
activity persisted at high levels in the resistant clones after AZ628
exposure, suggesting that sustained activation of ERK1/2 signaling
may be critical to the maintenance of cell proliferation and survival
in these cells and may play a role in conferring resistance to AZ628
(Fig. 1C and Fig. 2B).
ERK1/2 activation in AZ628-resistant clones is mediated by
MEK. To determine whether activation of ERK1/2 in AZ628resistant clones is mediated by the upstream ERK activator MEK,
we assessed the sensitivity of the resistant clones to the selective
MEK inhibitor U0126 (Fig. 2A). The IC50 of the resistant clones for
U0126 ranged from 3 to 7 Amol/L and was very similar to that of
the M14 parental cell line (2 Amol/L). Biochemical analysis revealed
that sensitivity to U0126 was consistent with the suppression of
signaling to the downstream effector ERK1/2 in both the M14
parental cells and resistant clones (Fig. 2B). An unrelated human
tumor cell line, A431 (negative control), was relatively insensitive to
U0126 (IC50 of 10 Amol/L), and consistent with this, there was no
detectable attenuation of p-ERK1/2 levels upon treatment with the
inhibitor (Fig. 2B). Thus, persistent ERK1/2 activation in the
AZ628-resistant clones seems to be mediated by MEK.
Sustained proliferation of AZ628-resistant clones is largely
independent of BRAF kinase activity. We next explored the
mechanism of persistent MEK-mediated ERK1/2 activation in
AZ628-resistant clones in the presence of drug. Although we had
excluded the role of a secondary BRAF mutation as a resistance

mechanism, it remained possible that reduced bioavailability of the
inhibitor was involved in mediating resistance. A second possibility
was that MEK-ERK activation was no longer driven by BRAF
kinase activity, but instead involved another aberrantly activated
intracellular pathway, as previously described in the setting of
acquired resistance to other selective kinase inhibitors (16). To
distinguish between these possibilities, we used lentivirus-mediated delivery of BRAF shRNAs to down-regulate the expression of
BRAF in the resistant clones. Immunoblotting showed successful
and specific depletion of BRAF protein using BRAF-directed
shRNA in both the parental M14 cells and the M14BRR2 AZ628resistant clone (Fig. 2C). As expected, knockdown of BRAF in the
parental M14 cells resulted in a substantial decrease in cell
viability, consistent with dependency on BRAF kinase activity in
these cells (Fig. 2D). However, depleting BRAF protein in the
M14BRR2 cell line or in the unrelated A549 tumor cell line
(negative control) only had a very mild effect on cell viability,
suggesting that these cells exhibited substantially reduced
dependency on BRAF for their sustained survival (Fig. 2D).
Moreover, whereas down-regulation of BRAF protein in the M14
parental cells resulted in complete abrogation of ERK1/2
activation, in the AZ628-resistant clones, p-ERK1/2 was only
partially suppressed (Fig. 2C), suggesting an uncoupling of ERK1/2
from BRAF in the resistant clones. Taken together, these results
strongly suggest that sustained survival of the AZ628-resistant
clones is mediated through an alternative activated pathway that is
largely independent of BRAF kinase activity.
AZ628-resistant clones express elevated CRAF. To identify the
activated pathway that contributes to cell survival via sustained
MEK-ERK signaling in the AZ628-resistant clones, we examined the
sensitivity of these cells to a variety of small molecule inhibitors of
cellular signaling pathways implicated in cancer (Fig. 3A). Among
the many tested inhibitors, the resistant clones exhibited
significantly increased sensitivity to the HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin relative to the parental M14 cell line (Fig. 3A and B). HSP90

is a chaperone protein required for conformational stability of
various proteins, including mutant V600E BRAF and the BRAFrelated RAF family member CRAF (27–30). Therefore, we examined
levels of the three RAF isoforms in these cells after geldanamycin
treatment. As previously reported (28, 29), we observed that
geldanamycin promotes a reduction in BRAF protein levels,
although the decline in CRAF protein levels in these cells was
notably more substantial, associated with a virtually complete
elimination of CRAF protein in both geldanamycin-treated M14
parental cells and the resistant clones (Fig. 3C). A role for CRAF in
the AZ628-resistant cells was further supported by the observation
that some of the resistant clones expressed significantly elevated
basal levels of CRAF relative to the M14 parental cells (Fig. 3D),
whereas BRAF and ARAF protein expression was not detectably
changed. As expected, the AZ628-resistant clones that expressed
elevated CRAF protein levels (M14BRR2, M14BRR5, and M14BRR8)
correspond to the clones demonstrating increased p-ERK1/2 levels
(Fig. 1B).
FISH analysis of interphase chromosomal spreads revealed that
the increased expression of CRAF in the AZ628-resistant cells was
not associated with CRAF gene amplification (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Similarly, RT-qPCR analysis showed indistinguishable
CRAF mRNA levels in both the parental cell line and the resistant
clones (Supplementary Fig. S3). Taken together, these data suggest
that resistance to AZ628 was associated with increased CRAF
protein levels that cannot be attributed to gene amplification or
increased CRAF gene transcription. Thus, changes in CRAF protein
levels in the resistant cell lines seem to reflect a posttranscriptional
regulatory mechanism.
Survival of AZ628-resistant cells is dependent on CRAF. To
confirm that proliferation and survival of the AZ628-resistant
clones is truly mediated by CRAF, we used an RNA interference
approach. M14 cells and the AZ628-resistant clones were infected
with a lentiviral vector expressing shRNA designed to specifically
target CRAF. Immunoblotting showed specific and effective downregulation of CRAF after infection (Fig. 4A). We observed a

considerable reduction in cell proliferation after CRAF downregulation in the AZ628-resistant clones (M14BRR2 and M14BRR8),
whereas the effect on M14 cells was significantly less (Fig. 4B).
Furthermore, ERK1/2 activation was completely suppressed by
CRAF depletion in the resistant clones (M14BRR2), but not in the
M14 parental cells (Fig. 4A), suggesting that ERK1/2 activation is
tightly coupled to CRAF in the AZ628-resistant cells.
During the course of characterizing the AZ628-resistant clones,
we observed that varying the concentration of AZ628 in which cells
were propagated led to a corresponding change in their expression
of CRAF protein. Thus, after five passages in 4 Amol/L AZ628, a
significant increase in CRAF protein expression was observed
(relative to cells propagated in 2 Amol/L AZ628), whereas there was
a relative decrease in CRAF levels in cells growing in
1 Amol/L AZ628 (Fig. 4C). Significantly, ARAF and BRAF protein
levels were unchanged under these conditions. Such a correlation
between AZ628 concentration and CRAF protein levels is
consistent with a ‘‘compensatory’’ regulation of CRAF expression
to permit cell growth and survival in the presence of AZ628.
To confirm a causal role for increased CRAF expression in the
AZ628-resistant phenotype, we determined that stable overexpression of CRAF in the M14 parental cells confers significant
resistance to AZ628 (IC50, 2 Amol/L) when compared with M14
cells transfected with a vector control (IC50, 100 nmol/L; Fig. 5A–C).
However, we note that CRAF-overexpressing M14 cells were not
as resistant to AZ628 as the clones that were initially selected in
2 Amol/L AZ628 (IC50 10 Amol/L). Taken together, these results
suggest that elevated CRAF expression is a potential mechanism of
acquired resistance to continuous AZ628 exposure, leading to
sustained activation of ERK1/2.
Elevated CRAF can confer primary insensitivity to a RAF
inhibitor. In a high-throughput profiling study of AZ628 sensitivity
across 500 human tumor-derived cell lines, we recently showed
that, whereas sensitivity to AZ628 is highly correlated with the
presence of the activating BRAF V600E mutation, a small subset of
cell lines exhibit primary insensitivity to AZ628 despite harboring

the V600E BRAF mutation (11). To determine if elevated CRAF
expression could potentially account for insensitivity to BRAF
inhibitors in such lines, we further characterized the three most
AZ628-insensitive cell lines harboring BRAF V600E mutations,
A2058, Sw1417, and Wm1552C (Fig. 6A). p-ERK1/2 activity was not
significantly suppressed by exposure to AZ628 in one of these three
AZ628-insensitive cell lines (Wm1552C) suggesting that, as in the
M14-derived AZ628-resistant clones, activated ERK1/2 was
uncoupled from BRAF in this cell line (Fig. 6A).

Significantly, immunoblot analysis revealed relatively high levels
of CRAF protein in the Wm1552C cell line (Fig. 6B). Wm1552C is a
melanoma-derived cell line that harbors the BRAF V600E mutation
and is highly refractory to AZ628 treatment (IC50, 10 Amol/L), as
well as to an alternative RAF inhibitor (data not shown).
Interestingly, in a high-throughput screen of 500 tumor cell lines
for geldanamycin sensitivity, Wm1552C scored as being exquisitely
sensitive to geldanamycin when compared with the other AZ628insensitve cell lines, consistent with a potential role for elevated

CRAF in maintaining cell proliferation in Wm1552C cells (Fig. 6B
and data not shown). Consistent with this possibility, immunoblot
analysis of geldanamycin-treated Wm1552C cells showed markedly
reduced CRAF protein levels and suppression of ERK1/2 activation
(Fig. 6B).
To confirm that Wm1552C cells are in fact dependent on CRAF,
we used the lentiviral-mediated CRAF shRNA to reduce CRAF
protein in these cells. After efficient depletion of CRAF in
Wm1552C cells, a significant decrease in viability was observed
(Fig. 6C). Taken altogether, our findings suggest that elevated CRAF
levels may also represent a mechanism that confers primary
insensitivity to RAF kinase inhibition in a subset of tumor cells
harboring the BRAF V600E mutation. Because it has been reported
that, in NRAS mutant melanomas, ERK activation is mediated
largely through CRAF (8), we also examined the ability of AZ628 to
suppress ERK phosphorylation in two different melanoma lines
that harbor activated NRAS alleles. We found that, unlike in the
AZ628-resistant M14 cells in which AZ628 fails to suppress ERK
activation, AZ628 treatment efficiently attenuates ERK activation
in the NRAS mutant melanoma cells, suggesting distinct roles for
CRAF in the activation of ERK in these two settings (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
Kinase-targeted drugs have emerged as an important new class
of cancer therapeutics, with demonstrated clinical efficacy in
multiple tumor contexts. However, treatment with such agents is
invariably associated with the eventual emergence of drug
resistance, which remains the most significant limitation of such
therapies. Therefore, it is important to identify mechanisms
underlying acquired drug resistance, as well as to use preclinical
models to reveal resistance mechanisms that are likely to be
observed clinically to accelerate the development of strategies to
overcome or prevent such resistance. Here, we have described a cell
culture model of acquired resistance to RAF inhibition in a BRAF
V600E mutated melanoma cell line with exquisite sensitivity to the
selective RAF kinase inhibitor AZ628. Inhibitors of this class are
currently undergoing early clinical testing, and consequently, it will
be quite some time before mechanisms of acquired drug resistance
can be established from clinical specimens, assuming that these
agents produce clinical benefit. Our findings have revealed a
potential mechanism underlying acquired resistance to a selective
RAF kinase inhibitor and, furthermore, have shown that HSP90
inhibition may be an effective therapeutic strategy to overcome
such resistance. Because HSP90 inhibitors are currently undergoing
clinical evaluation as cancer therapeutics (30–32), our findings may
prompt another potential application of such agents. Notably, a
recent report showed that HSP90 inhibition effectively promotes
tumor regression in a mouse transgenic model of EGFR, in which
the T790M TKI-resistance mutation was expressed (33). Such
findings, together with our findings, implicate HSP90 inhibitors as
potentially important drugs in a variety of drug resistance settings.
Previous preclinical cell culture–based studies have shown that
most BRAF mutant tumor cells are in fact ‘‘addicted’’ to BRAF and
that signaling to the downstream effector ERK, via the MEK kinase,
is a critical pathway by which BRAF drives cell proliferation and
survival in such tumors (6, 7, 9, 34). Our finding that M14
melanoma cells are growth inhibited by both BRAF and MEK
kinase inhibitors is consistent with those observations. Moreover,
the sustained ERK activation seen in drug-treated M14-derived
AZ628-resistant cells is also consistent with a critical role for this

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (12). June 15, 2008

pathway in these melanoma cells. Notably, not all of the individual
clones exhibit the same signaling properties, suggesting that
multiple distinct mechanisms of acquired resistance can be
established through such modeling, and further study will certainly
be required to reveal such alternative resistance mechanisms in
those clones.
We focused on the subset of AZ628-resistant clones in which ERK
signaling is sustained in the presence of the inhibitor. Interestingly,
these cells exhibit significantly elevated expression of CRAF, which
seems to involve a posttranscriptional mechanism. Although this
finding suggests that these cells may have switched their dependency
from BRAF to CRAF, it is noteworthy that AZ628 inhibits the BRAF
and CRAF isoforms somewhat equally in vitro.3 Therefore, it is
possible that increased CRAF protein levels decrease the bioavailability of drug within cells by virtue of increased intracellular
concentration of drug-binding targets. Similarly, increased expression of the BCR-ABL kinase, frequently as a result of specific gene
amplification, in imatinib-resistant cases of CML may contribute to
resistance through a similar drug titration mechanism (13).
The increased expression of CRAF in the AZ628-resistant cells
suggests that these cells may have shifted their dependency from
BRAF to CRAF. Notably, this switch does not necessarily require
CRAF kinase activity, as previous reports have shown kinaseindependent functions for CRAF (35, 36). The fact that the AZ628resistant cells can be growth inhibited by shRNA-mediated
knockdown of CRAF, but much less so by knockdown of BRAF, is
consistent with a shift in their dependency from BRAF to CRAF.
Previous studies have shown a physical interaction between BRAF
and CRAF, with BRAF promoting CRAF-mediated ERK activation
through the formation of BRAF/CRAF heterodimers, thereby
demonstrating an intimate relationship between these two proteins
in regulating the ERK pathway (8, 37, 38). Moreover, recent studies
have revealed a role for cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling in a switch
from BRAF to CRAF dependency for MEK-ERK signaling in BRAF
mutant melanoma cells (39). Thus, it is possible that the
acquisition of AZ628 resistance in M14 melanoma cells similarly
involves altered cAMP signaling. It is worth noting that the
parental M14 cells also display some CRAF dependency, as revealed
by gene knockdown studies, and that the M14 cells transfected with
CRAF are not as resistant to AZ628 as the selected clones. Thus, the
collective data point to a critical balance between BRAF and CRAF
in parental M14 cells that drives ERK signaling, which is
substantially affected by the relative levels of these proteins.
However, the precise mechanism by which CRAF levels are
increased to disrupt this balance in the drug-resistant clones is
currently unknown.
Molecular mechanisms of acquired resistance to kinase inhibitors
can also contribute to primary insensitivity to such treatment in
some cases. For example, the T790M EGFR mutation that seems to
account for acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs in about half of
TKI-responsive patients who subsequently relapse has also been
detected in a small subset of untreated tumors (40–42). Similarly,
amplification of the gene encoding the MET tyrosine kinase, which
occurs in a small percentage of EGFR TKI-treated NSCLCs, has also
been detected in NSCLCs demonstrating primary insensitivity to
treatment with EGFR TKIs (11). Based on our preclinical findings,
CRAF overexpression may similarly represent both a mechanism of
acquired drug resistance and primary drug insensitivity in a subset
of cases. The fact that tumor cell lines demonstrating elevated CRAF
protein are highly geldanamycin-sensitive, irrespective of whether
they were derived through acquired resistance or not, suggests that

elevated CRAF protein may constitute a tumor biomarker that
predicts response to HSP90 inhibition, as well as a lack of response
to BRAF kinase inhibitors, in both of these clinical settings.
