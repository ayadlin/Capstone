Abstract
Chronic activation through Toll-like receptors (TLR) occurs in
a number of pathologic settings, but has not been studied to
the same extent as primary activation. TLR7, expressed by B
cells and some dendritic cells, recognizes molecular patterns
associated with viruses that can be mimicked by synthetic
imidazoquinolines. In response to primary stimulation with
the imidazoquinoline, S28690, human mononuclear cells
produced tumor necrosis factor-A, but were unable to do so
upon restimulation with S28690. This state of ‘‘tolerization’’
lasted at least 5 days. Using chronic lymphocytic leukemia B
cells as a model to facilitate biochemical analysis, the
tolerized state was found to be associated with altered
receptor components, including down-regulated expression
of TLR7 mRNA and decreased levels of interleukin-1 receptorassociated kinase 1. Tolerization was characterized by a
transcriptionally regulated block in stress-activated protein
kinase and nuclear factor KB activation, with relatively
preserved activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK). Tolerized chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells were
found to be more sensitive to cytotoxic chemotherapeutic
agents, in part through altered stress-activated protein kinase
signaling pathways. This property of the TLR7-tolerized state
may potentially be exploited in the treatment of B cell cancers.

Introduction
Toll-like receptors (TLR) regulate innate and adaptive immunity
(1), and the identification of these molecules (along with their
ligands) suggests new ways to treat infections, autoimmune
diseases, and cancer (2). For example, we showed recently that
leukemic skin infiltrates in a patient with chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL) disappeared after treatment with a TLR7 agonist
(3). However, realization of the therapeutic potential of TLRs,
particularly TLR7, will require a deeper understanding of their
mechanisms of action.
TLR7 is expressed mainly by monocytes, activated B cells, and
plasmacytoid dendritic cells (1, 4). The natural ligand for murine
TLR7 (ref. 5; and human TLR8, which is related to TLR7; ref. 4) has
been identified as single-stranded RNA, whereas oxidized guanosines
(6) and imidazoquinolines (7) are synthetic human TLR7 ligands.
Like other TLRs, TLR7 contains a TLR and interleukin-1 (IL1)
receptor–related (TIR) domain, which associates with the adaptor

protein, MyD88, in the presence of a ligand (8). The TLR7-MyD88
complex recruits the IL1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family
members, IRAK1 and IRAK4. IRAK4 phosphorylates and activates
IRAK1, which recruits tumor necrosis factor-associated factor
(TRAF)-6. IRAK1 and TRAF6 then dissociate from TLR7 and
interact with a membrane-associated complex of the mitogenactivated protein kinase kinase kinase, transforming growth factorh–activated kinase 1 (TAK1), and two TAK1-binding proteins
(TAB1 and TAB2). This interaction leads to the phosphorylation of
TAB2 and TAK1, which translocate to the cytosol (with TRAF6 and
TAB1), whereas IRAK1 is degraded at the membrane. Subsequent
ubiquination of TRAF6 triggers TAK1 kinase activity. Activated
TAK1 phosphorylates components of the inhibitor of nuclear factor
(NK) nB (InB) kinase complex, which then phosphorylate InB,
causing it to be degraded and release NF-nB dimers to act as
nuclear transcription factors. TAK1 also activates stress-activated
protein kinase (SAPK) pathways by phosphorylating and activating
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases such as MKK4 or MKK3
and MKK6, which phosphorylate and activate c-Jun-NH2-kinases
(JNK) or p38, respectively. Activated JNK and p38 then translocate
to the nucleus where they phosphorylate and activate components
of activator protein-1 (AP-1), including c-Jun and c-Fos, which
mediates the transcription of genes such as tumor necrosis factora (TNFa; ref. 8).
Although these acute signaling events have been studied
intensively, the effects of chronic stimulation through TLR7 are
not well understood. The two situations may well lead to very
different biological outcomes (9). Understanding the effects of
repeated stimulation is especially important for the clinical use of
TLR7 ligands, where the optimal dose and schedule of injections
are not yet known (3). Accordingly, the effects of repeated
activation through TLR7 in primary human cells were studied in
this paper.

Materials and Methods
Blood samples. Heparinized blood (30–40 mL) was collected from
healthy volunteers and consenting CLL patients (with a persistent clonal
expansion of CD19+CD5+IgMlo lymphocytes; ref. 10), whose clinical
characteristics are described in Table 1 and who were untreated for at
least 3 months before study. Identification numbers were assigned
arbitrarily and maintained throughout the manuscript. Protocols were
approved by the Institutional Review Board.
Antibodies and reagents. Phycoerythrin-labeled or FITC-labeled CD19
and TNFa antibodies and blocking Fas antibodies were purchased from
PharMingen (San Francisco, CA). Lipopolysaccharide, actinomycin D,
cycloheximide, and phorbol dibutyrate were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).
Stock solutions of phorbol dibutyrate (5 mg/mL) were made in DMSO.

phosphate (Berlex Canada Inc. Pointe-Claire, Quebec), and cyclosporin A
(Novartis Canada Inc., Dorval, Quebec) were purchased from the hospital
pharmacy. SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), MG-132 (proteasome inhibitor), and
caffeic acid phenylester (CAPE; NF-nB inhibitor) were from Calbiochem
(San Diego, CA), and stock solutions (25 mg/mL) were made in DMSO. The
TLR7/8 agonist, S28690 (ref. 3; 3M Pharmaceuticals, St. Paul, MN), was
dissolved in serum-free AIM-V media (GibcoBRL, Grand Island, NY; with
33% DMSO) at 1.3 mg/mL and stored in the dark at 4jC. PBS was from
Wisent Inc. (Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Rouville, Quebec). IRAK4 antibodies
were from eBioscience (San Diego, CA). IRAK1 antibodies were a gift from
Dr. W.C. Yeh (Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada). Antibodies
against germinal center kinase, caspase-8 and caspase-9, JNK, p38, p42/p44
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), InB, c-Jun, cytochrome d , hactin, and the serine/threonine-phosphorylated forms of JNK, p38, ERK, InB,
and c-Jun were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The TNFa
converting enzyme inhibitor, TAPI (11), was from Peptides International
(Louisville, KY).
Primary cell purification. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
were isolated by density centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden). CLL cells were isolated from

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (4). February 15, 2007

blood by negative selection (RosetteSep, StemCell Technologies, Vancouver,
BC) as described previously (12).
TLR7 tolerization of CLL cells. Purified CLL cells (1.5  106 cells/mL)
were cultured in AIM-V plus 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma; 5  10 5 mol/L) in
6- or 24-well plates (Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lake, NJ) at 37jC
in 5% CO2. S28690 was added at the indicated concentrations. At various
times, the cells were collected, washed twice, resuspended at 1.5  106 cells/
mL, and then reactivated with S28690 (1 Ag/mL).
Membrane TNFA detection. Ten million CLL cells were cultured with
or without S28690 in 5-mL polystyrene tubes (Becton Dickinson Labware).
TAPI (100 Amol/L) was added to each tube, and CD19-FITC and TNFa-PE
antibodies were added 4 h later. Subsequent steps were similar to
conventional immunophenotyping (13).
Analysis of apoptotic and necrotic cell populations. Cells were
washed twice in PBS at room temperature and then resuspended at 5 to
10  105 cells/mL in 0.2 mL of PBS supplemented with 4 AL of AnnexinV-PE (BD PharMingen) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in
the dark. Twenty microliters of 7-amino-actinomycin (7-AAD) solution was
then added, and the suspension was incubated for an additional 15 min.
Annexin-V labels apoptotic cells, and 7-AAD identifies necrotic cells with

leaky membranes. The percentages of dead and dying CLL target cells were
determined by flow cytometry (14).
Immunophenotyping. Cells were washed once in PBS and then
resuspended in PBS plus 1% albumin before flow cytometric analysis.
Negative controls were isotype-matched irrelevant antibodies (PharMingen). Staining of nucleated cells was determined by gating on forward- and
side-scatter properties. Ten thousand viable counts were analyzed with a
FACScan flow cytometer and CELLQUEST software (Becton Dickinson, San
Jose, CA). Standardization of the flow cytometer was done before each
experiment using SpheroParticles (Spherotech Inc., Chicago, IL).
Isolation of total RNA and synthesis of cDNA. Total RNA was
extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. To remove contaminating genomic DNA,
10 Ag of the total RNA preparation was incubated with 10 units of RNasefree Dnase I (Promega, Madison, WI) for 30 min at 37jC. Total RNA
concentration was determined in a spectrophotometer at 260 nm.
cDNA was made with the Superscript First Strand Synthesis System for
reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in a 20-AL reaction
containing 3 Ag of DNase I–treated total RNA, 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.4),
50 mmol/L KCl, 2.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 10 mmol/L DTT, 0.5 Ag oligodT18, 0.5
mmol/L each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP, and 200 units Superscript II
reverse transcriptase. The priming oligonucleotide was annealed to total
RNA by incubating at 70jC for 5 min and then cooling to 4jC. Reverse
transcription was done at 42jC for 2 h, and cDNA was stored at 20jC
until PCR analysis.
Real-time PCR amplification. The following primers were used to
amplify human TNFa, TLR7, and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase
(HPRT) transcripts: TNFa forward, 5¶-ACCTCTCTCTAATCAGCCC-3¶; TNFa
reverse, 5¶-AGGAGCACATGGGTGGAG-3¶; TLR7 forward, 5¶-CTAAAGACCCAGCTGTGACCGA-3¶; TLR7 reverse, 5¶-CCAGTCCCTTTCCTCGAGACAT3¶; HPRT forward, 5¶-GAGGATTTGGAAAGGGTGTT-3¶; and HPRT reverse,
5¶-ACAATAGCTCTTCAGTCTGA-3¶.
PCR was done on a DNA engine Opticon System (MJ Research Inc.,
Waltham, MA) using SYBR Green I as a double-stranded DNA–specific
binding dye. PCR reactions were cycled 40 times after initial denaturation
(95jC, 15 min) with the following parameters: denaturation at 95jC for 15 s,
annealing of primers at 57jC (TNFa), 54jC (TLR7), and 52jC (HPRT) for
20 s, and extension at 72jC for 20 s. Fluorescent data were acquired during
each extension phase. After each PCR reaction, a melting curve analysis of
amplification products was done by cooling the samples to 4jC and then
increasing the temperature to 95jC at 0.2jC/s. Fast loss of fluorescence is
observed uniquely at the denaturing/melting temperature of the amplified
DNA fragment. Standard curves were generated with serial 10-fold dilutions
of cDNAs obtained using the same primers as for real-time PCR.
Immunoblotting. Protein extracts were made from activated CLL cells
as described previously (12). The proteins were resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE
gels and transferred onto Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore
Corp., Billerica, MA). Western blot analysis was then done according to the
manufacturer’s protocols for the specific antibodies. Chemiluminescence
signals were assessed with a GS-700 Imaging densitometer and MultiAnalyst software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).
Cytokine measurement. Cytokines in supernatants of CLL cells
cultured for 48 h were measured by a multi-analyte fluorescent bead assay
with a Luminex-100 system (Luminex Corp., Austin, TX) as before (12). A kit
for human IL10, IL6, and TNFa was used according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Individual cytokine concentrations (average of two separate measurements) were determined from
standard curves using Bio-Plex 2.0 software (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario).
The assay was linear between 3 and 10,000 pg/mL for each cytokine.
Statistical analysis. The Student’s t test was used to determine P values
for differences between sample means.

Results
Effect of restimulation through TLR7 on TNFA production
by PBMCs. Expression of TNFa mRNA by PBMCs from healthy
donors increased at least 10-fold within 1 h after primary

www.aacrjournals.org

stimulation by the imidazoquinoline, S28690, a TLR7/8 agonist
[for donors 1, 2, and 3 in Fig. 1A, TNFa transcript numbers (relative to HPRT transcripts) before stimulation were 0.03, 0.53, and
0.2 and increased to 9.22, 6.8, and 11.6, respectively, after stimulation]. However, if PBMCs were first activated with S28690 overnight, then washed and stimulated a second time, TNFa mRNA
induction was much weaker (Fig. 1A). By analogy with ‘‘endotoxin tolerance’’ (defined by the failure to make TNFa in response
to a second stimulation with the TLR4 agonist, lipopolysaccharide; ref. 15), cells that do not make TNFa in response to
restimulation with S28690 will subsequently be referred to as being
‘‘tolerized.’’
TLR7 tolerization was dependent on the strength of the initial
stimulation with S28690. The threshold for tolerization was f0.01
Ag/mL because only weak inhibition of TNFa mRNA production in
response to a second stimulation with 1 Ag/mL of S28690 was seen
at this initial dose (see results for donors 1 and 2, Fig. 1A).
To determine the duration of the tolerized state, PBMCs were first
exposed to S28690 overnight (to tolerize them) and then cultured
for various times before rechallenging them with S28690. Based
on the continued inability to transcribe TNFa after restimulation
with S28690, tolerization seemed to last at least 5 days (Fig. 1B).
Note that primary increases in TNFa transcripts decreased with
time (Fig. 1B, columns with diagonal lines), in accordance with the
deterioration of normal cells in culture, making it difficult to assess
tolerization reversal over a longer time period.
TLR7 tolerization in CLL cells. Because PBMCs are a heterogeneous population of cells that express TLR8, as well as TLR7, the
tolerized state caused by S28690 could be mediated through both
receptors. As a model to study the effects of restimulating TLR7,
primary CLL cells were used because they do not express TLR8 (3)
and respond to S28690 by increasing costimulatory molecule
expression, NF-nB activation, and cytokine production (including
TNFa; refs. 3, 14). Another advantage of this model was that large
numbers of monoclonal primary human cells could be obtained
easily for immunoblotting experiments.
As with PBMCs, TNFa mRNA transcripts in CLL cells increased
after primary stimulation, but not after restimulation with S28680
(data not shown). Tolerization was more transient than in PBMCs,
lasting 3 to 5 days (data not shown). However, the results support
the use of CLL cells as a model system for characterizing TLR7
tolerization.
Inhibition of TNFa protein production (suggested by impaired
mRNA expression) was confirmed in a flow cytometric assay using
a tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase to prevent solubilization of
membrane TNFa (mTNFa; ref. 13). As shown in Fig. 1C, mTNFa
increased on CLL cells within 4 h of primary stimulation with
S28690 and then decreased to baseline levels within 24 h (Fig. 1C,
third panel). In accordance with the block in TNFa mRNA
production, CLL cells restimulated with S28690 failed to increase
mTNFa expression (Fig. 1C, fourth panel). To show that the block in
TNFa production was specific to S28690 signaling, TLR7-tolerized
CLL cells were restimulated with phorbol dibutyrate (Fig. 1C, fifth
panel) and made TNFa, as reported previously (12).
To confirm that the block in TNFa production [indicated by
decreased mRNA expression after 1 h (Fig. 1A) and individual cell
protein expression after 4 h (Fig. 1C)] was maintained, cytokine
levels in culture supernatants were measured 48 h after restimulation with S28690 (Fig. 1D). The Luminex assays again revealed
impaired TNFa production by TLR7-tolerized CLL cells that were
restimulated with S28690. In contrast to TNFa, IL10 production

and CLL cells reactivated with S26890.
A, dose response: PBMCs from three
healthy donors were cultured overnight in
different concentrations of S28690. The
cells were then washed and restimulated
with S28690 (1 Ag/mL). After 1 h, TNFa
mRNA transcripts (relative to HPRT
transcripts) were determined by real-time
PCR and compared with TNFa expression
by S28690-activated PBMCs that had
been cultured overnight without prior
stimulation. The results for each donor are
shown and indicate that S28690 doses as
low as 0.1 Ag/mL strongly inhibited TNFa
mRNA production by PBMCs in response
to a second challenge with S28690.

were cultured with or without S28690
(1 Ag/mL) overnight, washed, and then
cultured again (to allow them to recover) for
1, 2, or 5 d, as indicated on the x -axis. The
cells were then washed again and either
cultured alone or restimulated with S28690
for 1 h. TNFa mRNA transcript numbers
were then determined by real-time PCR.
Impaired TNFa mRNA synthesis persisted
at least 5 d. The results for donor 4 are
representative of those from four different
donors. C, purified CLL cells were cultured
overnight alone or with S28690 (1 Ag/mL),
washed, and then restimulated with
S28690. After 4 h, membrane TNFa
expression was determined by flow
cytometry. An example for patient 83 is
shown, with two-color staining used to
reveal the purity of the CLL-B cell sample.

generally increased after restimulation with S28690 (Fig. 1D, Pts. 47,
29, and 21). TLR7-tolerized cells from some patients also made IL6
in response to S28690 (Fig. 1D, Pts. 47, 46, and 29). These
observations suggested that some aspects of TLR7 signaling were
retained in the tolerized cells.
TLR7 expression and signal transduction in tolerized cells.
Decreased expression of TLR7 caused by the initial encounter with
S28690 could explain the failure of TLR7-tolerized cells to make
TNFa upon restimulation with S28690. We were unable to detect
TLR7 proteins by immunoblotting with commercially available
antibodies, but using quantitative real-time PCR, TLR7 transcript
levels were found to decrease in tolerized CLL cells and PBMCs
(Fig. 2A). TLR7 message was generally higher in CLL cells than in
PBMCs, which contain many T cells that do not express TLR7.
Despite this apparent decreased receptor expression, the production of IL6 and IL10 by restimulated CLL samples (Fig. 1D)
suggested that some TLR7-signaling properties were present in
tolerized cells. As described in the Introduction, a number of

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (4). February 15, 2007

signaling pathways are activated when TLR7 encounters an
agonist, such as S28690. The state of activation of these pathways
can be determined by immunoblotting with antibodies that
recognize phosphorylated forms of important components of the
pathway. Activation of the p38, SAPK, and MAPK pathways were
determined using antibodies against phosphorylated forms of p38,
JNK, and ERK. NF-nB activation was indicated with phospho-InB
antibodies.
As shown in the examples in Fig. 2B, initial stimulation with
S28690 resulted in strong phosphorylation of InB, along with the
46- and 54-kDa JNK isoforms (which arise by differential mRNA
splicing; ref. 16). CLL cells initially stimulated with S28690 also
expressed phosphorylated p42/p44 MAPK (ERK1 and ERK2) and
phosphorylated p38, although the degree of activation of the latter
two pathways seemed weaker than NF-nB and SAPK.
Strikingly, JNK phosphorylation was inhibited strongly in CLL
cells that were restimulated with S28690. Increased levels of
phosphorylated InB were sometimes observed in CLL cells that had

been exposed to S28690 for 24 h (Fig. 2B) but did not change after
restimulation with S28690, in contrast to the strong activation seen
after primary stimulation. Activation of the p38 MAPK pathway
(evidenced by the appearance of phosphorylated p38) was also
inhibited in reactivated CLL cells (Fig. 2B).
The situation with the classic MAPK pathway was different. As
shown in the examples in Fig. 2B [and consistent with increased
IL6 and IL10 production by some reactivated CLL cells (Fig. 1D)],
TLR7-tolerized CLL cells expressed increased levels of phosphorylated p42/p44 ERK-1/2 proteins in response to restimulation with
S28690, despite the decreased TLR7 receptor expression.

and CLL cells were cultured alone or tolerized with S28690. After 24 h, numbers
of TLR7 mRNA transcripts (relative to HPRT transcripts) were determined by
real-time PCR. Left and right , individual results from nine CLL patients and nine
normal donors, respectively; these suggest that receptor levels were lower in
tolerized cells. B, purified CLL cells were cultured alone (lanes 1 and 2 ) or with
S28690 (1 Ag/mL; lanes 3 and 4 ) for 24 h. The cells were then washed thrice
and cultured alone (lanes 1 and 3) or activated with S28690 (lanes 2 and 4 ).
After 1 h, changes in the phosphorylation status of JNK, p42/44 ERK, p38, and
InB were determined by immunoblotting with phosphospecific antibodies. Blots
were first probed with phosphospecific antibodies and then stripped and
reprobed with pan-specific JNK, p42/p44, or p38 antibodies (data not shown) or
h-actin antibodies as a loading control. The results with CLL cells from patients
23 and 87 are representative of 22 other patient samples. C, time course:
tolerized CLL cells were washed and restimulated with S28690. Aliquots were
collected 1, 10, 30, and 60 min later, and the phosphorylation status of JNK was
determined by immunoblotting. CLL cells, cultured overnight without primary
activation, were treated with S28690 at the same time as the tolerized cells and
analyzed after 1 h, as a positive control. The examples shown are representative
of four patient samples studied in the same way and suggest that impaired
signaling through TLR7 in tolerized CLL cells was not due to enhanced
phosphatase activity.

Taken together, these results suggested that TLR7 expression and
the activation of the SAPK and NF-nB signaling pathways were
decreased in TLR7-tolerized cells.
Defective receptor kinase activity in TLR7-tolerized CLL cells.
Decreased phosphorylation of JNK isoforms in restimulated TLR7tolerized cells could reflect defective kinase or enhanced phosphatase activity. If increased activity of phosphatases caused the
decreased phosphorylation of JNK at the times indicated in
Fig. 2B, then high levels of the phosphorylated forms should be
seen transiently after reactivation with S28690. Accordingly,
phospho-JNK levels in tolerized cells were determined 1, 10, 30,
and 60 min after reactivation with S28690 (Fig. 2C). No or only weak
JNK phosphorylation was seen after restimulation, in contrast to primary stimulation of these cells (Fig. 3C, lane 2). These results suggested that impaired SAPK activation in tolerized CLL cells was due
mainly to defective kinase activity of the TLR7 signaling complex.
Expression of IRAK1 and IRAK4 in TLR7-tolerized cells. As
described in the Introduction, signal propagation through TLR7 is
dependent on IRAK1 and IRAK4 (17). IRAK1 expression decreases
after stimulation with IL1 and some TLR ligands, which may
account for some tolerant states (such as endotoxin tolerance;
ref. 18). Similarly, IRAK4 protein levels are down-regulated after
prolonged stimulation through TLR-2, TLR-4, or TLR-9 (potentially
through cleavage of IRAK4 by a protease induced by NF-nB
activation; ref. 19). Therefore, we considered that decreased levels
of IRAK1 or IRAK4 could account for defective signaling in
response to reactivation with S28690 in TLR7-tolerized cells. As
shown in Fig. 3A, IRAK4 levels did not change in response to
stimulation with S28690. However, IRAK1 levels decreased in TLR7tolerized cells (Fig. 3A, top).
Transcriptional regulation of TLR7 tolerization. The TLR7tolerized state developed over at least 6 to 8 h (data not shown),
suggesting it might depend on the synthesis of proteins that
inhibited subsequent signaling through TLR7. To determine if TLR7
tolerization was regulated through transcriptional mechanisms,
CLL cells were stimulated for 6 h with S28690 in the presence of
actinomycin D (which inhibits mRNA transcription) before
restimulation with S28690 (Fig. 3B). SAPK activation was restored
partially by actinomycin D, suggesting that the tolerized state was
under partial transcriptional control. Similar experiments with
protein synthesis inhibitors, such as cycloheximide, are not shown
because these inhibitors activate SAPK pathways directly (16).
The above results suggested that TLR7 tolerization was
transcriptionally regulated (Fig. 3B) and characterized by impaired
SAPK activation (Fig. 2). Because primary stimulation of TLR7
caused the activation of NF-nB (Fig. 2) and transcriptional targets
of NF-nB can inhibit SAPK activation (20), NF-nB signaling
inhibitors were used to address the possibility that activation of
NF-nB by the initial stimulation with S28690 accounted for the
subsequent development of TLR7 tolerization.
Dexamethasone is an inhibitor of NF-nB–mediated gene
transcription (21). CAPE prevents nuclear NF-nB translocation
(22). MG-132, a 26S proteasome inhibitor, prevents degradation of
InB (23). As shown in Fig. 3C (lanes 5 and 6), treatment of CLL cells
with MG-132 during primary stimulation with S28690 ameliorated
the block in JNK phosphorylation upon restimulation with S28690.
Dexamethasone and CAPE also restored JNK phosphorylation
partially in TLR7-tolerized cells (Fig. 3C, lanes 7, 8, 9, and 10). Taken
together, the results suggested that initial activation of NF-nB by
S28690 contributed to the block in JNK phosphorylation that
characterized TLR7-tolerized cells.

Figure 3. IRAK1 expression and effects of transcription and NF-nB inhibitors in
TLR7-tolerized cells. A, IRAK1 and IRAK4 levels were determined by
immunoblotting in unstimulated CLL cells, cells stimulated for 1 h with S28690,
TLR7-tolerized cells (6 h after primary stimulation with S28690), and tolerized
cells restimulated for 1 h with S28690. Similar results were seen in nine different
patient samples. B, CLL cells were cultured alone, with S28690 (1 Ag/mL) for
6 h (to induce tolerization), or with S28690 and actinomycin D (30 Amol/L) for
6 h (to determine the role of induced proteins on subsequent TLR7 tolerization).
The cells were then collected, washed, and either cultured alone or restimulated
with S28690 for an additional 1 h. The phosphorylation status of JNK proteins
was then measured by immunoblotting. The results show that phosphorylation of
JNK proteins was restored partially in tolerized cells by blocking mRNA
transcription during the initial stimulation through TLR7 (compare lanes 4 and 6).
C, MG-132 (10 Amol/L), dexamethasone (15 Ag/mL), or CAPE (25 Ag/mL)
were included in the initial 6-h priming cultures with S28690. The results show
that inhibition of NF-nB activation also prevented the inhibition of JNK
phosphorylation in CLL cells reactivated with S28690. Similar results were
obtained with four other patient samples.

Enhanced sensitivity of TLR7-tolerized CLL cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Previously, we showed that CLL cells exposed
to S28690 for 2 days were killed more easily by cytotoxic T cells (CTL;
ref. 14). Because, in retrospect, these cells had been tolerized, we
considered that their sensitivity to CTLs might extend to cytotoxic
drugs. Vincristine is a microtubule inhibitor with activity against
CLL cells in vitro (24). A dose of 0.1 Ag/mL of vincristine was found
to be relatively nontoxic to CLL cells (shown in Fig. 4A, top two
panels, and summarized in Fig. 4B), in contrast to doses of 1 Ag/mL
or more which killed most cells within 24 h (data not shown). S28690
alone increased the death of CLL cells somewhat (Fig. 4B and
compare with Fig. 4A, first and third panels). Remarkably, TLR7tolerized tumor cells were highly sensitive to low doses of vincristine
(Fig. 4B and compare with Fig. 4A, second and fourth panels).
In separate experiments, the enhanced susceptibility of TLR7tolerized cells to vincristine was found to extend to low doses of

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (4). February 15, 2007

Adriamycin (data not shown), an anthracycline that kills tumor
cells by a variety of mechanisms, including DNA intercalation and
induction of oxidative stress (25). However, fludarabine, a purine
analogue that is active against CLL cells in vivo (26), did not exhibit
enhanced activity against TLR7-tolerized CLL cells in vitro (data
not shown).
Although TLR7-tolerized CLL cells were uniformly more
sensitive to low doses of vincristine, variations in the magnitude
of killing by vincristine were apparent (Fig. 4B). However, no
obvious correlations were noted with the underlying cytogenetic
abnormalities or CD38 expression (Table 1), which are known to be
important biological parameters associated with variations in the
clinical behavior of CLL cells (27).
To determine if the timing of exposure to S28690 affected the
resulting sensitivity to vincristine (28), CLL cells were simultaneously treated with vincristine and S28690. In marked contrast to
prior treatment with S28690, acute treatment protected CLL cells
from 10-fold higher doses of vincristine (Fig. 4C). This finding
suggested that entry into the tolerized state was necessary for cells
to become sensitized to vincristine.
Mechanism of enhanced sensitivity of TLR7-tolerized CLL
cells to vincristine. As revealed in Fig. 4A, low doses of vincristine
caused tolerized CLL cells to become mainly necrotic. Because
energetic conditions are thought to determine the mode of cell
death (29), the less nutrient-rich serum-free conditions used in
these experiments may have promoted necrosis. Indeed, addition
of serum increased the percentage of annexin-V+ 7-AAD cells but
did not alter the enhanced sensitivity of tolerized cells to
vincristine. Moreover, the enhanced death was not mediated
mainly by classic mitochondrial or death receptor pathways (30)
because cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-9 occurred at around
the same time after the release of cytochrome c from the
mitochondria, and death could not be blocked by Fas or TNF
antibodies, or by permeability pore transition inhibitors such as
cyclosporin A (data not shown).
Strong JNK signaling, especially in the setting of aberrant NF-nB
activation, is thought to kill cells (20, 31). Because microtubule
disruption is known to activate JNK signaling (32), we examined
vincristine-induced signaling in TLR7-tolerized CLL cells (Fig. 5).
Low doses of vincristine caused small increases in the phosphorylated p54 isoform of JNK (Fig. 5A; compare lanes 1 and 3, top).
Activation of JNK, implied by the presence of the phosphorylated
form, was also indicated by the small increase in the level of
phosphorylated c-Jun, a substrate of JNK. Strikingly, the same dose
of vincristine produced much higher levels of phospho-JNK and
phosopho-c-Jun in TLR7-tolerized cells (compare lanes 3 and 7).
The elevated levels of phospho-c-Jun also reflected increased total
c-Jun levels in TLR7-tolerized cells (compare lanes 5–8 with lanes
1–4). SP600125, a cell-permeable inhibitor of JNK, partially
decreased the phosphorylation of c-Jun (compare lanes 7 and 8)
and also decreased the amount of death observed in cultures of
tolerized CLL cells treated with low doses of vincristine (Fig. 5B).
These results suggest that changes in JNK signaling properties were
associated with the heightened sensitivity of TLR7-tolerized CLL
cells to vincristine.

Discussion
The results in this paper suggest that stimulation through TLR7
produces a state of tolerization that is characterized by impaired
production of TNFa (Fig. 1) and aberrant activation of SAPK and

TLR-7 Tolerization in Human B Cells

NF-nB signaling pathways (Fig. 2). Importantly, this tolerized state
seems to confer enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents
(Figs. 4 and 5) and CTLs (14).
Not all immunomodulatory agents seem capable of sensitizing
CLL cells to chemotherapy. For example, exposure to type 1 IFNs
(28) for 48 h protected CLL cells from low doses of vincristine (data
not shown), in marked contrast to S28690 (Fig. 4).
The failure to make TNFa by TLR7-tolerized cells may be due to
blocked SAPK and NF-nB activation because the TNFa promoter
contains AP-1 and NF-nB sites (33). However, the tolerized state
does not involve a complete shutdown of signaling through TLR7.
Cytokines, such as IL6 and IL10 (Fig. 1D), were made, and the
MAPK pathway (as shown by phosphorylation of ERK proteins; Fig.
2B) was still activated in TLR7-tolerized cells restimulated with
S28690.
The mechanism of TLR7 tolerization seems to be multifactorial.
An altered balance between proinflammatory cytokines (TNFa)

and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL10; Fig. 1D) could lead to
impaired inflammatory signal transduction. Decreased expression
of TLR7 mRNA (and presumably TLR7 protein; Fig. 2A) and IRAK1
(Fig. 3A) would be expected to decrease the magnitude of signaling
through TLR7 upon reactivation. In addition, the initial activation
of NF-nB through TLR7 seemed to induce inhibitors of TLR7 by
transcriptional mechanisms because TLR7 tolerization could be
blocked by actinomycin D and NF-nB inhibitors (Fig. 3B and C).
Despite the apparent absence of a unique mechanism for TLR7
tolerization, the complexity and diversity of the possibilities attest
to the probable biological importance of the phenomenon.
The observation that a state of ‘‘tolerance’’ follows activation
with a variety of TLR agonists (including endotoxin and imidazoquinolines) suggests that it has been important for multicellular
organisms to develop methods to limit production of potentially
harmful, inflammatory cytokines caused by TLR-mediated responses. Endotoxin tolerance also involves multiple mechanisms,

presence of vincristine and the

contrast to the tolerized state, acute
treatment with S28690 protected CLL
cells from vincristine-induced death.
The P values indicate that the differences
were statistically significant.

Figure 5. Enhanced vincristine-induced JNK activation in TLR7-tolerized CLL
cells. A, purified CLL cells were cultured alone or tolerized with S28690
(1 Ag/mL) for 48 h. The cells were then washed and recultured in the presence or
absence of vincristine (0.1 mg/mL), as well as the specific JNK inhibitor
SP600125 (20 Amol/L). After 1 h, lysates were collected and levels of
phosphorylated JNK and c-Jun levels, along with total levels of JunD, c-Jun, and
h-actin, were determined by immunoblotting. The results show that JNK
activation (as measured by phosphorylated JNK levels and reflected by
enhanced phosphorylation of c-Jun) in response to an otherwise sublytic dose of
vincristine was enhanced in TLR7-tolerized cells (compare lanes 3 and 7). The
results with CLL cells from patient 25 are shown and are representative of six
other samples. B, control and tolerized CLL cells from the indicated patients
were treated with vincristine (0.1 Ag/mL) for 18 h in the presence or absence of
SP600125. The percentage of necrotic and apoptotic cells was then determined
by staining with annexin-V and 7-AAD. Specific death was determined by
subtracting the percentage of dead cells without vincristine from the percentage
of dead cells in the presence of vincristine. The results show that increased
sensitivity of tolerized cells to vincristine could be blocked partially by SP600125.

including reduced surface expression of TLR4 (a member of the
lipopolysaccharide receptor complex), enhanced phosphatase
activity, alterations in signal-transduction pathways through the
TLR, reduced expression of IRAK1, reduced production of TNFa
relative to anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL10 and TGFh,

and increased expression of negative regulators of TLR signaling,
such as IRAK-M, and members of the suppressor of cytokine
signaling protein family (15). TLR7 tolerization resembles endotoxin tolerance in several ways, but there seem to be some
mechanistic differences. The disappearance of germinal center
kinase, an upstream activator of JNK, was seen in reactivated
endotoxin-tolerant PBMCs, but not in TLR7-tolerized CLL cells
(data not shown; ref. 34). Similarly, IRAK4 disappears in endotoxintolerant cells (19) but not in TLR7-tolerized cells (Fig. 3A).
Cytokines (such as IFNg and the granulocyte macrophage
colony-stimulating factor) have been reported to overcome
endotoxin tolerance (35), but type I IFNs could not reverse TLR7
tolerization (data not shown).
The physiologic significance of the tolerized state that follows
strong TLR activation, particularly the TLR7-tolerized state, is not
clear. Endotoxin-tolerant macrophages and dendritic cells that
arise in patients after Gram-negative septicemia may cause
immunosuppression associated with enhanced susceptibility to
subsequent infections (36). Daily injections of CpG oligonucleotides
would presumably tolerize TLR9-expressing cells and cause a
generalized state of immunosuppression, associated with the
destruction of lymph node follicles (37). We found previously that
TLR7-tolerized CLL cells (i.e., CLL cells treated with S28690 for
2 days) could not stimulate T cells to proliferate, despite strong
expression of costimulatory molecules, but were more susceptible
to killing by CTLs (14). Taken together, these observations suggest
that tolerization may mark cells to be cleared more easily by CTLs
during viral infections, when pathogen-associated molecular
patterns (such as single-stranded RNA and oxidized guanosine)
are present.
Although TLR7 tolerization may have evolved to facilitate
antiviral immunity, induction of tolerization in TLR7+ cancer cells
may potentially be used to increase their susceptibility to cytotoxic
chemotherapeutic drugs or CTLs that have been activated by a
vaccine (38). Clearance of leukemic skin infiltrates by topical
imidazoquinolines (3) might be explained partly by TLR7-tolerization induction in target tumor cells. Clinical studies are needed to
provide more information about the utility of TLR7 tolerization in
management strategies for CLL and, by extension, other B cell
tumors.
