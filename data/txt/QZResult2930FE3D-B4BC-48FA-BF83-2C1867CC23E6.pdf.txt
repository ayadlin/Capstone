Abstract
Loss of fat mass is a key feature of cancer cachexia and has
been attributed to increased adipocyte lipolysis. The mechanism behind this alteration is unknown and was presently
investigated. We studied mature s.c. fat cells and differentiated preadipocytes from 26 cancer patients with and without
cachexia. Hormone-induced lipolysis and expression of lipolysis-regulating genes were determined together with body
composition and in vivo lipolytic activity ( fasting plasma
glycerol or fatty acids related to body fat). Body fat was
reduced by 40% and in vivo lipolytic activity was 2-fold
increased in cachexia (P = 0.001). In mature adipocytes, the
lipolytic effects of catecholamines and natriuretic peptide
were 2- to 3-fold increased in cachexia (P < 0.001). This was
completely counteracted by inhibiting the rate-limiting
lipolysis enzyme hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). In cachexia,
the expression levels of HSL mRNA and protein were increased
by 50% and 100%, respectively (P = 0.005–0.03), which strongly
correlated with in vitro lipolytic stimulation (r = 0.7–0.9). The
antilipolytic effect of insulin in mature fat cells and the
stimulated lipolytic effect in differentiated preadipocytes were
unaltered in cachexia. Patients who lost weight due to other
factors than cancer cachexia had no change in adipocyte
lipolysis. In conclusion, adipocyte lipolysis is increased in
cancer cachexia not due to nonepigenic factors or to weight
loss per se, but most probably because of enhanced expression
and function of adipocyte HSL. The selective inhibition of this
enzyme may prevent fat loss in cancer patients. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Many cancer patients have a wasting syndrome termed cachexia,
which is characterized by loss of skeletal muscle and adipose
tissue. Although the mechanisms behind muscle wasting have been
studied intensely, much less is known about the factors promoting
loss of adipose tissue in cancer patients (1, 2). However, it is
believed that increased fat cell lipolysis, resulting in loss of lipids
from adipose tissue, is independent of malnutrition, as reviewed
(1–4). Indeed, many studies have shown that increased in vivo
lipolysis is a key factor behind adipose cachexia in weight-losing
cancer patients (5–8).
Increased production of lipolytic factors from adipose tissue
such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) or
by tumor-derived lipolytic factors such as zinc-a2 glycoprotein

(ZAG) could explain increased lipolysis in cancer cachexia (4, 9).
Moreover, altered action of the major lipolysis-regulating hormones, catecholamines (stimulatory), natriuretic peptides (stimulatory), and insulin (inhibitory), may be of importance (4). These
hormones regulate lipolysis by separate mechanisms, which all
converge at the final rate-limiting step in lipolysis activation [i.e.,
hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL)] as reviewed (10). The recently
described natriuretic peptide system is mediated by the cyclic
guanosine 3¶,5¶-monophosphate (cGMP) pathway, which stimulates
protein kinase G so that HSL is activated (11).
No adipocyte lipolysis mechanism has thus far been shown in
human cancer cachexia. The present in vitro study was conducted
to elucidate if the hormonal regulation of lipolysis in fat cells by
insulin, catecholamines, and natriuretic peptides is altered in
cancer cachexia. Cancer cachexia was defined as nonintentional
weight loss in subjects with gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma. To
control for nonspecific effects of cancer and weight loss, we
included two control groups. One consisted of weight-stable cancer
patients whereas a second was composed of weight-losing cancer
patients with evidence of malnutrition (anorexia and/or gastrointestinal obstruction). The reasons for weight loss in the latter group
might be different than in the cachexia group.

Materials and Methods
Patients. All patients scheduled for gastrointestinal cancer operation
between January 2004 and December 2005 (f300 patients) were evaluated
for the study and all patients who were (a) fit in spite of their cancer
disease, (b) had not received prior anticancer treatment, and (c) were
willing to participate were included (n = 26). The study was approved by the
Ethics committee of the Karolinska Institutet. After explaining the study in
detail to each patient, their informed consent was obtained. The patients
were divided into three groups based on diagnosis before surgery by one of
the responsible surgeons (T.A., J.P., B.I.), who did not take part in the
adipose analyses. The diagnosis of each patient was blinded for those
responsible for lipolysis studies (P.A.), gene expression studies (J.H.), protein
expression studies (M.R.), and preadipocyte studies (V.v-H., J.L., A.D.) until
all data were obtained. None of the patients had jaundice. Cancer cachexia
(n = 7) was defined as prediagnosed gastrointestinal cancer with no
evidence of gastrointestinal obstruction or anorexia with nausea and/or
stomach pain, in combination with unintentional weight loss of >5% of the
habitual weight during the last 3 months or >10% weight loss during the last
6 months. One control group (n = 11) consisted of subjects with
prediagnosed gastrointestinal cancer who reported no important weight
change during the last year. The second control group (n = 8) was
composed of subjects with prediagnosed gastrointestinal cancer who had
reported weight loss as defined for the cancer cachexia group above in
combination with symptoms of anorexia, dysphagia, and/or evidence of
obstructive cancer, which supposedly had caused malnutrition. The study
was designed as ‘‘intention to treat.’’ Therefore, all included subjects were
kept in the primary analyses in spite of postoperative reclassification. None
in the cachexia group was reclassified. These patients had adenocarcinoma
in the pancreas (n = 5), colon (n = 1), or gastric cardia (n = 1). Two weightstable control patients did not have cancer but had chronic pancreatitis.

The remaining patients had pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n = 3), ventricular
adenocarcinoma (n = 1), colon adenocarcinoma (n = 3), or esophagal
dysplasia (n = 1). Two of the weight-losing control patients did not have
cancer but had chronic pancreatitis or chronic cholecystitis but no
jaundice. The remaining weight-losing control patients had obstructive
esophagal cancer (n = 5) or obstructive pancreas cancer associated with
stomach pain when eating (n = 1).
Clinical examination. The patients came to the laboratory after an
overnight fast. Height, weight, waist-to-hip ratio, and body composition
with bioimpedance using Bodystat Quad Scand 4000 (Bodystat Ltd.) were
determined. A venous blood sample was obtained for the determination of
lipids, glycerol, fatty acids, albumin, C-reactive protein, insulin-like growth
factor I (IGF-I), leptin, noradrenaline, adrenaline, and insulin by the
hospital’s accredited routine chemistry laboratories, and atrial natriuretic
peptide was measured using a RIA kit (Phoenix Peptides). The nutritional
status was assessed by using a standardized questionnaire for oncology
termed Subjective Global Assessment (SGA; ref. 12). Tumor stage was
classified postoperatively according to the TNM Classification of Malignant
Tumors by International Union Against Cancer, 6th edition (13).
Fat biopsies. After the clinical examination, an abdominal s.c. fat biopsy
(0.5–1 g) was obtained by needle biopsy as described (14). The tissue pieces
(5 mg each) were rapidly rinsed in saline and submitted to lipolysis
investigations. One 300-mg portion of the collected adipose tissue was
frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at 70jC for later gene expression
studies. This was done for all subjects except for three weight-losing
controls. Another 300-mg portion was kept in the same way for subsequent
Western blot analysis. This was done for six cachexia patients, eight weightstable controls, and two weight-losing controls. We have previously shown
that the tissue pieces removed and frozen in this way are free from damaged
cells and blood (15).
Lipolysis. The remaining tissue from the needle biopsy (500–600 mg)
was immediately processed further. Isolated fat cells were prepared by
collagenase treatment of adipose tissue; fat cell size was determined; and
lipolysis experiments were done on isolated fat cells as described (16). In
brief, diluted fat cell suspensions (2%, vol/vol) were incubated in an
albumin buffer (pH 7.4) supplemented with glucose, ascorbic acid, and, for
the insulin experiments, adenosine deaminase and 10 3 mol/L of 8-bromocyclic AMP (8-Br-cAMP). The cells were incubated at 37jC for 2 h without
(basal) or with increasing concentrations (10 16–10 5 mol/L, depending on
the hormone used) of noradrenaline, atrial natriuretic peptide, insulin
together with 10 2 mol/L 8-Br-cAMP, 8-Br-cAMP (10 2 mol/L) alone, or
10 2 mol/L 8-bromo-cGMP (8-Br-cGMP). Thereafter, glycerol release into
the incubation medium (lipolysis index) was determined. In additional
lipolysis experiments, the buffer containing 8-Br-cAMP plus adenosine
deaminase was also supplemented with a maximum effective concentration
(10 5 mol/L) of a highly selective inhibitor of hormone-sensitive lipase 4isopropyl-3-methyl-2-[1-(3-(S)-methyl-piperidin-1-yl)-methanoyl]-2H-isoxazol-5-one, termed BAY (17).
For five cancer cachexia patients and eight weight-stable controls,
sufficient amounts of the stroma fraction of adipose tissue were obtained
for preadipocyte isolation. These cells were differentiated exactly as
described (17) for 2 weeks, and lipolysis experiments without (basal) or
with 10 5 mol/L of noradrenaline were done as described (16).
The lipolysis data were expressed in two ways: the first was glycerol
release per gram of lipids in the studies of mature fat cells or per gram of
protein in the preadipocyte studies. The second was as a function of basal
(non–hormone stimulated) glycerol release. The latter was defined as
insulin-induced values divided by 8-Br-cAMP–induced values in the
antilipolytic experiments and noradrenaline- or atrial natriuretic peptide–
induced values divided by basal values in the lipolytic experiments.
Maximum effect was defined as the value obtained at maximum effective
hormone concentration. Priority was given to expression of lipolysis as a
function of basal rate because there is a strong relationship between this
way of expressing lipolysis and HSL gene or protein expression in human
s.c. fat cells (18).
Gene expression. Total RNA was extracted from 300 mg of adipose
tissue using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen GmbH). The Agilent 2100

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (11). June 1, 2007

Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) was used to confirm the integrity of the
RNA. One microgram of total RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen) and random hexamer
primers (Invitrogen). cDNA synthesis was done simultaneously for all subjects using the same mix of primers and RT kit. In a final volume of 25 AL,
5 ng of cDNA were mixed with 2 SYBR green PCR master mix (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Inc.) and primers (Invitrogen). The primer pairs were selected
to yield a single amplicon based on dissociation curves and analysis by
agarose gel electrophoresis. The primers used were 5¶-GTGTCAGACGGCGAGAATG-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-TGGAGGGAGGGAGGGATG-3¶ (antisense) for
adipose triglyceride lipase, 5¶-GGAAGTGCTATCGTCTCTGG-3¶ (sense) and
5¶-GGCAGTCAGTGGCATCTC-3¶ (antisense) for HSL, and 5¶-TGACTCAACACGGGAAACC-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-TCGCTCCACCAACTAAGAAC-3¶ (antisense)
for 18S. Quantitative real-time PCR was done with an iCycler IQ (Bio-Rad
Laboratories). The mRNA levels were determined by a comparative C t
method. The subject with the highest C t value was used as a reference from
which all other C t values for the target gene and reference gene, respectively,
were subtracted from this C t value. The C t values were then normalized to
rRNA for 18S using the formula 2DCt-target gene / 2DCt-reference gene.
Protein expression. Approximately 300 mg of white adipose tissue
were crushed and lysed in protein lysis buffer [1% Triton-X 100, Tris-HCl
(pH 7.6), and 150 mmol/L NaCl, 4jC], supplemented with protease
inhibitors [1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and Complete (Boehringer Mannheim)], and homogenized. The homogenate was centrifuged
and the infranatant was collected and saved. Protein content was assayed
using BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce). One hundred micrograms
of total cellular protein were loaded on polyacrylamide gels and separated
by standard 12% SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred to polyvinylidine fluoride
membranes (Amersham Pharmacia). Blots were blocked for 1 h at room
temperature in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat
dried milk. This was followed by an overnight incubation at 4jC in the
presence of antibodies directed against HSL (19) or the control protein
h-actin (Sigma). Secondary a-rabbit antibodies conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase were from Sigma. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected
by chemiluminescence using a detection kit (SuperSignal) from Pierce
and specific bands were detected and quantified using a Chemidoc XRS
system and the Quantity One Software from Bio-Rad, and expressed as the
HSL/h-actin ratio.
Statistical analysis. The reported values are mean F SD or median and
range. The values with adipose tissue were considered to be normally
distributed because retrospective analysis of previously investigated large
cohorts using the same lipolysis and gene or protein expression methods
showed a normal distribution of data (18, 20, 21). Results were compared
using ANOVA and appropriate post hoc tests, Student’s unpaired or paired
t test, or linear regression by the method of least squares. Kruskal-Wallis
and Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare SGA and tumor score
values. A power calculation was made before patient collection and was
based on the previously known distribution of maximum noradrenalineinduced glycerol release divided by basal glycerol release (22). We expected
the recruitment of weight-stable patients to be easier and anticipated the
relative proportion between the three groups to be 2:3:2. Based on these
estimations and mean and SD of noradrenaline/basal lipolysis, we
calculated that we had to recruit 7 cachexia patients, 11 weight-stable
control patients, and 7 weight-losing control patients to detect a 70%
difference between cachexia and the two control groups at P < 0.05
(ANOVA) with 80% power using Sample Power (SPSS, Inc.).

Results
In vivo results. Regarding the clinical findings (Table 1), the
groups were of comparable mean age, and gender distribution did
not differ in a significant way. Body mass index (BMI) and amount
of body fat were equal in the cachectic and weight-losing control
groups but lower compared with the weight-stable group. Neither
total body water nor lean body mass differed between the three
groups. Fat cell volume was similar in the two weight-losing groups

but much smaller than in the weight-stable group. In addition,
plasma levels of insulin, leptin, triglycerides, and serum albumin
were similar in the two weight-losing groups but lower than the
weight-stable group. IGF-I levels were reduced by half in the
weight-losing control group in comparison with the other two
groups. In vivo lipolytic activity, measured as the concentration of
plasma fatty acids or plasma glycerol divided by amount of total
body fat, was about twice as high in patients with cachexia as
compared with patients in the two control groups. Blood pressure,
pulse rate, and plasma concentrations of catecholamines or atrial
natriuretic peptide were similar in all groups. SGA scores were
increased in cachexia and weight-losing control patients. The score
was much higher in the latter group as compared with the group
with cachexia (P = 0.027, Mann-Whitney test). There was no
difference in tumor severity. The average score was 3.
Lipolysis in vitro. Insulin inhibited lipolysis in a similar
concentration-dependent manner in the three groups (Fig. 1).
Maximum inhibition of lipolysis varied from 55% to 60% in these
groups (Fig. 1).
Noradrenaline and atrial natriuretic peptide stimulation of basal
lipolysis rate was much more efficient (P < 0.001, ANOVA repeated
measure) in cachectic patients as compared with the control
groups, who did not differ between each other (Fig. 1). At the
maximum effective concentration, noradrenaline stimulated lipolysis 5-, 3-, and 2.5-fold in the cachectic, weight-stable control, and

www.aacrjournals.org

weight-losing control groups, respectively (P = 0.01; Fig. 1).
Corresponding values for natriuretic peptide were 7-, 4-, and
3-fold (P = 0.02; Fig. 1).
We also expressed lipolysis as absolute values of glycerol release
(Amol/g of lipid/2 h). As shown in Table 2 this mode of expression
gave similar results as above; however, some of them did not reach
a level of statistical significance (P = 0.06–0.07). Furthermore, basal
(nonhormonal) lipolysis did not differ between groups (Table 2).
The cAMP analogue 8-Br-cAMP caused a 7-fold stimulation of
lipolysis in the cachectic group as compared with a 3-fold
stimulation in the two control groups (Fig. 2). The selective HSL
inhibitor BAY decreased the lipolytic effect of the cAMP analogue by
>90%, with no differences between the groups (Fig. 2). Finally, 8-BrcGMP stimulated lipolysis 10 F 6-fold in cachexia and 3.0 F 1.6-fold
and 2.7 F 0.5-fold, respectively, in the two control groups (P = 0.03).
Gene expression. In the adipose tissue of cachectic patients,
HSL mRNA expression was 50% higher compared with the two
control groups, which did not differ between each other, but there
was no difference between the three groups in adipose triglyceride
lipase expression (Fig. 2). As regards maximum lipolytic effect of
noradrenaline or atrial natriuretic peptide, both hormones showed
a strong positive correlation with HSL gene expression (r = 0.58;
P = 0.005 for noradrenaline and r = 0.50; P = 0.02 for atrial
natriuretic peptide; graphs not shown). No such correlation was
observed for adipose triglyceride lipase mRNA (r  0.15).

Protein expression. The number of subjects investigated was too
small for an analysis of the three separate groups. However, HSL
protein expression was 2-fold increased in cachexia as compared with
the two control groups (0.23 F 0.57 versus 0.69 F 0.34 arbitrary units;
P = 0.032; Fig. 2). When all protein data were compiled, there was a
strong positive correlation between HSL protein expression and
noradrenaline-stimulated lipolysis (Fig. 2). As much as 50% of the
variation in lipolysis (adjusted r 2) could be explained by variations in
HSL. Similar correlations were obtained with atrial natriuretic
peptide (r = 0.67; P = 0.005) or 8-Br-cAMP (r = 0.85; P < 0.001). The
results were not altered in a significant way when absolute values for
HSL expression were used instead of HSL/actin ratio (r = 0.67–0.85;
graphs not shown). h-Actin expression was not correlated with
lipolysis (r = 0.03–0.07). The mRNA and protein expression of HSL
showed a very strong correlation (r = 0.81; P = 0.001).
Preadipocytes. In preadipocytes (Fig. 2) differentiated to
adipocytes, the lipolytic effect of noradrenaline was the same in
cachexia and weight-stable control (8-fold stimulation of basal
rate). Similar results were obtained when preadipocyte lipolysis was
expressed as a function of cellular protein content (values not
shown).
Four control subjects were wrongly classified, as they did not
have cancer. When they were excluded, the results of the analysis
presented above were essentially the same as for the whole
material.

Discussion
The weight-losing control group had impaired food intake and/or
evidence of gastrointestinal stricture, which presumably caused
malnutrition. These problems were not found in the cachectic
group. Tumor severity was similar in all three groups. The two
weight-losing groups had comparable values for BMI, adipose mass,
and plasma levels of leptin, insulin, triglycerides, and albumin, all of
which were much lower than in weight-stable cancer patients. This
suggests a similar catabolic state in the two former groups.
However, there were two clear differences in the clinical characteristics of the two weight-losing groups. The weight-losing controls
had much higher SGA scores than cachexia patients, and only the
former patients displayed lower IGF-I values. Both SGA and IGF-I
are markers of malnutrition as discussed (23, 24). Thus, our clinical
data clearly suggest that the two weight-losing groups, at least in
part, have different etiologies underlying their reported weight loss,
malnutrition being dominant only in the control group.
We found no difference in lean body mass between the groups.
However, none of our patients was extremely lean (lowest BMI was
18.6 kg/m2), indicating that we might have studied patients in an
early cachexia phase when there is predominantly loss of adipose
tissue. This notion is supported by a recent large study showing
that body fat was lost more rapidly than lean tissue in progressive
cancer cachexia (25).

Only the cachexia group had significantly increased in vivo
lipolysis although there was no evidence of increased sympathetic
nervous activity or elevated levels of circulating natriuretic peptide.
As regards the cellular mechanism promoting this increase in
lipolysis in human cachexia, the antilipolytic effect of insulin was
not significantly altered in cachexia. In contrast, the lipolytic effects
of the two major lipolysis-regulating hormone systems in man
(i.e., catecholamines and natriuretic peptides) were markedly
increased in patients with cachexia as compared with the two
control groups. Furthermore, stimulation of lipolysis with cAMP or
cGMP analogues also gave increased effect in the cachexia group.
Noradrenaline and natriuretic peptide stimulate adipocyte lipolysis
through separate signal pathways (mediated by either cAMP or

cGMP) that all converge at HSL, an enzyme that is also a target for
cAMP and cGMP. The similar findings with the two cyclic
nucleotides indicate that the cellular mechanism for increased
lipolysis in cachexia is due to enhanced lipolytic signaling of the
hormone systems at the post-receptor level because of enhanced
function of HSL. Indeed, this seems to be the case because lipolysis
could be inhibited to the same extent in all three groups using the
highly selective HSL inhibitor BAY.
In a previous study, adipose tissue gene expression of HSL was
increased in cancer patients as compared control patients (26). We
found a 50% increase in HSL gene expression selectively in the
cachexia group and a 2-fold increase in amount of HSL protein in
adipocytes among this group as compared with the other two

groups together. In the whole material, HSL gene and protein
expression correlated strongly with the lipolytic effect of noradrenaline or natriuretic peptide and could explain 50% of the
between subject variation in lipolytic effect of the hormone.
Furthermore, mRNA and HSL protein levels were strongly
interrelated and overexpression of HSL leads to a marked increase
in adipocyte lipase activity (27). Thus, when present and previous
data are taken together, it is likely that increased production of
HSL protein, due to enhanced gene activity in fat cells, is the major
cause behind enhanced lipolysis in cancer cachexia.
The novel lipase adipose triglyceride lipase may be important for
determining fat cell lipolysis (28). In this study, however, there was
no effect of cachexia on adipose triglyceride lipase expression, and
the expression of this enzyme did not correlate with lipolysis.
Furthermore, there was <10% residual adipocyte lipolytic activity in
all groups when HSL -induced lipolysis was inhibited, suggesting no
or a minor role of adipose triglyceride lipase for the altered
regulation of lipolysis in cancer cachexia.
Our findings suggest that treatment of cancer cachexia with
recently developed selective HSL inhibitors may be of clinical value
to prevent loss of adipose tissue (29). Although loss of adipose
tissue may be less harmful than muscle loss in cancer cachexia, the
former seems to precede the latter. Maybe early antilipolysis
treatment could slow down or prevent the progressive wasting
among cancer patients.
It is unlikely that increased lipolysis in cachexia is secondary to
weight loss because weight-losing control patients had the same
adipocyte lipolytic activity as the weight-stable control patients.
However, increased lipolysis in cachexia is not an epigenetic
phenomenon because the difference in lipolysis between weightstable controls and cachexia disappeared in preadipocytes that had
differentiated into fat cells. The influence of external factors had
been eliminated in these cells. These factors could be produced
within adipose tissue or they could be circulating factors produced
by certain tumors. One such lipolytic mediator not investigated by

us could be ZAG (4, 9). It is quite possible that ZAG-induced
lipolysis is increased in human cancer cachexia because the protein
stimulates lipolysis through the same pathway as catecholamines
(30, 31). In rodents with experimentally induced cancer cachexia, a
tumor-derived factor was shown to sensitize adipose tissue to
lipolytic stimuli (32).
Are the present findings relevant for other lipolytic regulators
such as IL-6 and TFNa? Probably not, because basal lipolysis was
not influenced in cancer cachexia. In human fat cells, TNFa above
all enhances the basal rate of adipocyte lipolysis (33). Furthermore,
the stimulatory effect of IL-6 on human lipolysis is as acute, which
does not fit in with our HSL observations (34).
Our studies were conducted on rather small study groups. It is
very difficult to recruit cancer cachexia patients to this type of
investigation. However, the study was powered to detect the
observed differences in lipolysis.
In conclusion, we propose that yet unidentified factors among
certain cancer patients increase the gene expression and thereby
the protein production of HSL in fat cells. This enhances the
stimulatory effect of lipolytic hormones and possibly of specific
cachexia factors such as ZAG. Because the hormones are always
present in the circulation, lipolysis is continuously activated
because the action of the major antilipolytic hormone, insulin, is
not altered. Therefore, HSL inhibitors may be useful in the
treatment or prevention of cancer cachexia.
