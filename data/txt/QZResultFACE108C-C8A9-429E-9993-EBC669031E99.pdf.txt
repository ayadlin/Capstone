Blocking Hedgehog Survival Signaling at the Level of the GLI
Genes Induces DNA Damage and Extensive Cell Death in
Human Colon Carcinoma Cells
Tapati Mazumdar, Jennifer DeVecchio, Akwasi Agyeman, Ting Shi, and Janet A. Houghton

Abstract
Canonical Hedgehog (HH) signaling is characterized by Smoothened (Smo)-dependent activation of the
transcription factors Gli1 and Gli2, which regulate HH target genes. In human colon carcinoma cells, treatment
with the Gli small-molecule inhibitor GANT61 induces extensive cell death in contrast to the Smo inhibitor
cyclopamine. Here we elucidate cellular events upstream of cell death elicited by GANT61, which reveal the basis
for its unique cytotoxic activity in colon carcinoma cells. Unlike cyclopamine, GANT61 induced transient cellular
accumulation at G1–S (24 hours) and in early S-phase (32 hours), with elevated p21Cip1, cyclin E, and cyclin A in
HT29 cells. GANT61 induced DNA damage within 24 hours, with the appearance of p-ATM and p-Chk2.
Pharmacologic inhibition of Gli1 and Gli2 by GANT61 or genetic inhibition by transient transfection of the Gli3
repressor (Gli3R) downregulated Gli1 and Gli2 expression and induced gH2AX, PARP cleavage, caspase-3
activation, and cell death. GANT61 induced gH2AX nuclear foci, while transient transfection of Gli3R showed
expression of Gli3R and gH2AX foci within the same nuclei in HT29, SW480, and HCT116. GANT61 specifically
targeted Gli1 and Gli2 substantiated by specific inhibition of (i) direct binding of Gli1 and Gli2 to the promoters
of target genes HIP1 and BCL-2, (ii) Gli-luciferase activity, and (iii) transcriptional activation of BCL-2. Taken
together, these findings establish that inhibition of HH signaling at the level of the GLI genes downstream of Smo
is critical in the induction of DNA damage in early S-phase, leading to cell death in human colon carcinoma cells.

Introduction
Binding of the secretory Hedgehog (HH) ligands to their
transmembrane receptor Patched (Ptch1) initiates the classical HH signaling pathway by releasing Smo from Ptch1dependent suppression. Smo activates the final arbiters of
HH signaling, the Gli transcription factors, that regulate HH
target genes (1, 2). Aberrantly activated HH signaling has been
identified in the malignant phenotype of several types of
human cancers (reviewed in ref. 3), involving amplification
of GLI1 or GLI2 and mutations in PTCH1 or SMO (4, 5). There
is emerging evidence that the HH pathway progresses during
colon carcinogenesis (6, 7) and in metastatic disease (8),
whereas in normal colonic tissue, HH signaling is involved
in differentiation (9–11). Canonical HH signaling genes are
expressed in primary colon cancers, metastatic disease,

human carcinoma xenografts (8), and human colon carcinoma
cell lines (12, 13). In several studies, HH signaling molecules
have been linked to genomic instability, involving inactivation
of homologous recombination or nonhomologous end joining,
defects in checkpoint activation, and predisposition to development of cancers (14–16). However, little is known functionally about this signaling pathway and how it affects the
survival and pathogenesis of colon cancer.
The majority of studies that determine the effects of inhibiting the HH signaling pathway have used the classic Smo
inhibitor, cyclopamine, which cross-links Smo (17). Cyclopamine has shown variable activity in several different types of
cancer cells (18). Oncogene-driven signaling pathways converge downstream of Smo on the Gli transcription factors
providing noncanonical regulation of HH signaling (5, 19–22).
Such noncanonical activation of the Gli proteins can therefore
circumvent the inhibition of Smo resulting in reduced efficacy
of or resistance to Smo inhibitors. The Gli family of transcription factors is composed of Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3 that regulate
HH-induced target gene expression (3). Gli2 seems to be the
primary activator of HH signaling, with Gli1 as a transcriptional target of Gli2, which may amplify HH-induced target
gene expression (4, 23–25). Gli1 and Gli2 induce transcription
of overlapping and distinct sets of target genes (4, 23–25). Fulllength Gli3 has activator functions, whereas a C-terminus
cleaved form mediates repressor activity (3, 5). Expression
of the repressor form of Gli3 (Gli3R) inhibited proliferation

Gli1 and Gli2 Inhibition Induces DNA Damage

and induced cell death in primary cultures of human colon
cancers and metastases. Furthermore, human colon carcinoma cells transduced with Gli3R failed to form xenografts in
nude mice (8), indicating the importance of Gli1 and Gli2 and
corroborating the role of the HH signaling pathway in colon
cancer cell survival.
To identify the mechanisms that regulate HH-driven cellular survival in the context of colon cancer, we employed
cyclopamine to target Smo. In addition, to target the Gli
proteins downstream of Smo, we employed a small-molecule
inhibitor of both Gli1 and Gli2, GANT61, identified in a cellbased small-molecule screen for inhibitors of Gli1-mediated
transcription (26). We have previously shown that GANT61
reduced GLI1, GLI2, and PTCH1 mRNA expression in human
colon carcinoma cell lines and significantly modulated cDNA
microarray gene expression profiles downstream of Gli1/Gli2
function (12). Furthermore, inhibition of HH signaling by
GANT61 induced greater cytotoxicity in human colon carcinoma cell lines than targeting Smo with cyclopamine (13). To
elucidate the mechanisms regulating this differential response,
studies were conducted in the human colon carcinoma cell
line HT29, which is mutant for p53. Cells treated with GANT61
(20 mmol/L) accumulated at G1–S and in early S-phase at 24
and 32 hours, respectively, and by 48 hours underwent cell
death. In contrast, cyclopamine (20 mmol/L)-treated HT29
cells showed minimal effects on cell-cycle distribution or cell
death. GANT61-treated cells accumulated p21Cip1, cyclin E, and
cyclin A in G1- and S-phase cells at 24 to 40 hours, in contrast
to cyclopamine-treated cells, and stable knockdown of p21Cip1
did not influence sensitivity to GANT61. GANT61 but not
cyclopamine induced DNA damage by 24 hours with the
appearance of gH2AX nuclear foci at the sites of DNA strand
breaks. Similar to the cellular effects induced by pharmacologic
inhibition of Gli1 and Gli2 by GANT61, transient transfection of
the Gli3R mutant, which inhibits the activating functions of
Gli1 and Gli2 (3), downregulated expression of Gli1 and Gli2,
induced expression of gH2AX, cleavage of PARP, and caspase-3,
and cell death. GANT61 activated ATM and Chk2 (but not ATR
and Chk1) by 4 hours, which was sustainable. Transient
expression of Gli3R in HT29, SW480, and HCT116 cells induced
nuclear localization of the Gli3R protein and induced formation of gH2AX nuclear foci within the same cells. Data suggest
that exogenously expressed Gli3R is functional and suppression of HH/Gli signaling results in DNA damage in multiple
human colon carcinoma cell lines that show active HH signaling. This phenomenon is p53 independent, because HT29 and
SW480 cells express a mutant form of p53 whereas HCT116
harbor a wild-type p53 gene. Within 1 hour of exposure,
GANT61 (i) reduced the binding of Gli1 and Gli2 to the
promoter regions of the Gli target genes HIP1 and BCL-2 but
not FAS, which is not a direct Gli target, and (ii) inhibited the
transcriptional regulation of BCL-2. Furthermore, GANT61
specifically inhibited Gli-luciferase (luc) activity in contrast
to NF-kB-luc or AP1-luc activities, indicating its specificity for
Gli1 and Gli2. These findings emphasize the importance of
targeting the Gli proteins to functionally inhibit HH signaling
and their critical role in the cellular survival of human colon
carcinoma cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
HT29, SW480 and HCT116 cells were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection and routinely verified by
morphology, growth characteristics, response to cytotoxic
agents [Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining]. cDNA
microarray gene profiles were also characteristic. Cells were
verified biannually to be mycoplasma-free. Cells were maintained in folate-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% dFBS
and 80 nmol/L [6RS]5-methyltetrahydrofolate. The cells were
trypsinized and counted using a Z2 Coulter particle count and
size analyzer (Beckman Coulter). For Western analysis, antibodies against p21Cip1, b-actin, and HSP90a/b were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-Gli1 antibody was from
Novus Biologicals, and anti-Gli2 antibody was from Cell
Signaling Technology. Anti-c-myc antibody (9E10) was
obtained from the Hybridoma Core, Lerner Research Institute.
Anti-p21Cip1, anti-cyclin E, and anti-cyclin A antibodies used
for bivariate flow cytometry were purchased from BD Biosciences. For Western analysis and confocal microscopy, antibodies against gH2AX, p-Chk1, Chk-1, p-ATR, ATR, p-Chk2,

Invitrogen. GANT61 was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals
and cyclopamine from Toronto Research Chemicals.
Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/PI staining and
flow cytometric analysis
These were as described previously (27).
Cell-cycle distribution, bivariate flow cytometric
analysis, and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation
For cell-cycle distribution and bivariate flow cytometry,
cells were analyzed as previously described (28). For analysis
of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, cells were plated
(50,000 cells/well) in a 6-well format and treated with GANT61
(20 mmol/L) or cyclopamine (20 mmol/L) for up to 48 hours.
Cells were pulsed with BrdU (10 mmol/L; BD Biosciences) for
30 to 45 minutes and analyzed by flow cytometry for distribution within the cell cycle as per the manufacturer protocol.
Western analysis
This was carried out as previously described (27).
RNA interference studies
HT29 cells stably expressing p21Cip1 shRNA were generated
by transducing HT29 cells with scrambled-shRNA or the genespecific short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-expressing retroviruses.
Details are provided in Supplementary Materials and
Methods.
COMET assay
Cells were processed, and electrophoresed in agarose gels as
described (29). Tail moment (TM) and tail length (TL) were
used to characterize the DNA damage within individual cells.

Confocal microscopy
Cells were plated (50,000/well) on coverslips in 6-well plates.
The cells were treated with GANT61 (20 mmol/L) or cyclopamine (20 mmol/L) for up to 48 hours and processed for
microscopy. Details of microscopy are described in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Gli3R and transient transfections
The myc-tagged C-terminus deleted construct Gli3R (gift of
Dr. Ariel Ruiz i Altaba, University of Geneva Medical School,
Geneva, Switzerland) has been previously described (3). HT29
cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) with Gli3R or the empty vector pCS2-MT (gifted
by Dr. David Turner, University of Michigan's The Molecular &
Behavioral Neuroscience Institute, Ann Arbor, MI). Cells were
used for experiments 24, 48, or 72 hours posttransfection.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis
HT29 cells were treated with GANT61 (20 mmol/L) for 1 or
24 hours and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis
was conducted using Gli1 or Gli2 antibodies and Abcam ChIP
kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Details are
provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Luciferase reporter assays
The Gli-luc reporter construct (kindly provided by Dr. Rune

Toftga rd, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden) has been
previously described (30). The NF-kB-luc plasmid p5XIP10kB
was previously reported (27). The AP1-luc (kindly provided by
Dr. Philip H. Howe, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH) contains
a basic promoter element (TATA box) joined to tandem
repeats of the AP1 binding element (Stratagene). Transient
transfection for 24 hours with luciferase reporters was carried
out 24 hours after GANT61 (20 mmol/L) treatment, as
described (13).
RT-PCR
HT29 cell were treated with GANT61 (20 mmol/L) for 1 hour,
followed by RNA isolation for up to a further 4 hours. Following conversion into cDNA, samples were used for quantitative
PCR (qPCR) as described previously (13). Primers used were
BCL-2 forward 50 -GGAGGATTGTGGCCTTCTTT-30 and BCL-2
reverse 50 -GCCGTACAGTTCCACAAAGG-30 .

Results
GANT61 and cyclopamine exhibit differences in
cell-cycle regulation and induction of cell death
We have shown previously in a panel of 6 human colon
carcinoma cell lines that at equimolar concentrations (10–30
mmol/L), GANT61 induced more than 80% cell death by 72
hours of treatment in contrast to cyclopamine (13). These

5906

concentrations and time frames for the induction of cellular
effects are similar to those determined in other model systems
for inhibitors of HH signaling (8, 26, 31, 32). A more detailed
study of the mechanisms regulating the differential effects
between GANT61 and cyclopamine was conducted in HT29
cells, which express mutant p53. Cells were treated with
GANT61 (20 mmol/L) or cyclopamine (20 mmol/L), followed
by PI staining and flow cytometric analysis of cell-cycle
distribution. GANT61-treated cells accumulated at G1–S by
24 hours, moving into early S-phase by 32 hours, and subsequently becoming sub-G1 by 48 hours (Fig. 1A). In contrast,
treatment with cyclopamine resulted in a modest increase in
G1 to S-phase cells by 48 hours; by 72 hours cells had not
progressed either into S-phase or into sub-G1 (Fig. 1A).
BrdU incorporation analysis
In GANT61-treated cells, cellular accumulation at the G1–S
boundary was evident by 24 hours, as shown by a 37% increase
in BrdU incorporation, which increased to 52% by 32 hours,
and an 8% increase in S-phase cells at this time. By 40 hours,
there was a decrease in cells in G1–S (>40% decrease in BrdU
incorporation), in S-phase (17%), and an increase (60%) in cells
within the sub-G1 compartment (Fig. 1B and Supplementary
Fig. S1). These effects were consistent with decreased BrdUlabeled cells in G2–M. In contrast, following cyclopamine
treatment, the appearance of a stronger G1–S peak by 48
hours observed in cell-cycle analysis (Fig. 1A) was paralleled by
an 11% to 14% increase in BrdU-labeled cells in the S-phase
(Fig. 1B), clearly showing differences in cell-cycle regulation
between GANT61- and cyclopamine-treated HT29 cells.
Bivariate flow cytometric analysis of the distribution of
p21Cip1, cyclin E, and cyclin A within the cell cycle
Cell-cycle progression is regulated by different cyclin–Cdk
complexes. Cyclin E, which regulates Cdk2, is expressed in late
G1 and early S-phase (33). Cyclin A, expressed in late G1, begins
to accumulate in S-phase and is rapidly destroyed at the onset
of mitosis (34). Furthermore, p21Cip1 could have a potential
role at the G1–S boundary. Expression of these proteins was
analyzed by bivariate flow cytometric analysis, simultaneously
with DNA content. In GANT61-treated cells, p21Cip1 was
induced and continued to be elevated in G1 phase cells over
a period of 24 to 40 hours (Fig. 1C). Similarly, cyclin E appeared
at 24 hours in G1 and S-phase cells at 32 to 40 hours; the largest
accumulation of cyclin E occurred in G1 phase cells where
most remained accumulated at 40 hours. Cyclin A accumulated significantly in the G1 phase following GANT61 treatment, whereas the percentage of cells expressing cyclin A in
S-phase as well as G2–M phase cells declined. In cyclopaminetreated cells, p21Cip1 and cyclin E remained at low levels in all
cell-cycle phases for up to 40 hours. Cyclin A was expressed in
untreated cells in G1, S, and G2–M but decreased in all phases
by 24 hours following cyclopamine treatment (Fig. 1C and
Supplementary Fig. S2). Data are consistent with cellular
accumulation at the G1–S boundary and in early S-phase in
GANT61-treated HT29 cells with accumulation of p21Cip1,
cyclin E, and cyclin A mostly in G1 and partially in S-phase
cells. In contrast, no effects on p21Cip1 or cyclin E distribution,

sine, cytidine, and guanosine; 20 mmol/L each). Supplementation with nucleosides conferred partial protection (50% cell
death) from GANT61-induced cytotoxicity (80% cell death;
Fig. 2C), indicating a role of DNA damage signaling in
GANT61-induced cytotoxicity.
To further characterize the DNA damage response, expression of gH2AX, a marker of double-strand breaks (DSB; ref. 35),
was determined by Western analysis in HT29 cells treated for
up to 72 hours with GANT61 (20 mmol/L) or cyclopamine (20
mmol/L; Fig. 3A). Appearance of gH2AX was detected at 24
hours after GANT61 treatment upstream of cell death and was
strongly expressed at 48 hours when cells were undergoing
apoptosis. In contrast, gH2AX was barely detectable in cyclopamine-treated cells at 24 hours by Western analysis and only
slightly increased at 48 hours. Further evaluation of gH2AX
expression by confocal microscopy is shown in Figure 3B.
Following treatment of HT29 cells with GANT61, gH2AX was
strongly detected at 24 hours along with a change in cellular
morphology comprising cellular dissociation in the absence of
cell death. Changes in cellular morphology by confocal microscopy and gH2AX foci were not detectable within 48 hours of
cyclopamine exposure (Fig. 3B).

or sustained accumulation of cyclin A, were evident in cyclopamine-treated cells, consistent with lack of significant cellcycle perturbation or induction of cell death.
GANT61-induced cell death is independent of p21Cip1
HT29 cells stably transduced with p21Cip1shRNA or
scrambled-shRNA (control) were treated with GANT61 (20
mmol/L) for 72 hours, followed by Annexin V/PI staining and
flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 1D). GANT61 induced similar
levels of cell death (75%–80%) in scrambled-shRNA- or p21Cip1
shRNA-transduced cells, indicating the lack of a functional
role for p21Cip1, as well as p53, in the mechanism of GANT61induced cell death.
GANT61 induces DNA damage
To determine whether GANT61 induces DNA damage
following cellular accumulation at G1–S and in early S-phase,
HT29 cells were treated with GANT61 (20 mmol/L) or cyclopamine (20 mmol/L) for 24 or 48 hours. Single cells were
analyzed by the COMET assay, which detects DNA damage by
alteration in the pattern of cellular elution through agarose
gels (Fig. 2A). Significant changes in elution profiles were
detected in GANT61-treated cells by fluorescence miscroscopy, tail moment, and tail length (Fig. 2B). In contrast,
cyclopamine-treated cells showed an increase in tail moment
but not in tail length at 48 hours. HT29 cells were also exposed
to GANT61 (20 mmol/L) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; control)
in the absence or presence of nucleosides (thymidine, adeno-

Genetic downregulation of Gli1 and Gli2 by Gli3R
induces DNA damage and cell death
The critical role of Gli1 and Gli2 function in cellular survival
in colon carcinoma cells was further investigated by genetic
downregulation of Gli1 and Gli2. A C-terminus deleted mutant
form of Gli3 [Gli3R, Gli3C’DCla1 with a myc tag; refs. 3, 8)] was
employed, which contains the N-terminus region that determines nuclear localization and repressor activity. Transient
transfection of HT29 cells with Gli3R-pCS2-MT reduced cell
growth by 60% over a period of 72 hours (microscopy, cell
number), induced cell death (microscopy, Annexin V/PI staining), and decreased Gli1 and Gli2 protein expression (Western). By 72 hours posttransfection, Gli2 protein was
reexpressed whereas decreased Gli1 protein was sustained
(Fig. 4A). Gli3R was determined by expression of the myc tag,
which was detected by 24 hours and was highest at 48 hours
posttransfection (Fig. 4A). Similar effects on cell growth, cell
death, and Gli1 and Gli2 protein expression were induced by
GANT61 (20 mmol/L; Fig. 4B). Furthermore, induction of DNA
damage was detected following transient transfection with
Gli3R, marked by elevated expression of gH2AX, detected
within 24 hours. This was associated with cleavage of fulllength PARP and caspase-3, also determined in GANT61-

treated cells (Fig. 4C). To ensure that the effects of Gli3R
were not specific to HT29 only, Gli3R was transiently
expressed in SW480 and HCT116 cells and gH2AX expression
was determined by confocal microscopy. The expression of
Gli3R was visualized using an anti-myc antibody. Within 24
hours of transient transfection, myc-tagged Gli3R was
detected in nuclei of cells that also expressed gH2AX nuclear
foci in all 3 cell lines, HT29, SW480, and HCT116 (Fig. 5).
Collectively, data show that both pharmacologic inhibition
and genetic inhibition of HH signaling result in reduced cell
growth, increased cell death, and induction of DNA damage
that is associated with reduced Gli1 and Gli2 protein levels.
These findings emphasize the significance of the HH signaling
pathway in human colon cancer cell growth and survival,
regulated at the level of the GLI genes.
GANT61 inhibits specific binding of Gli1 and Gli2 to Gli
target genes and blocks transcriptional activity
To further determine the specificity of GANT61 for targeting the function of Gli1 and Gli2, ChIP analysis was conducted
using GANT61-treated HT29 cells (20 mmol/L; 24 hours).
Following isolation of chromatin, immunoprecipitation with
Gli1- or Gli2-specific antibodies, or antibodies against IgG
(negative control) or histone H3 (positive control), was carried
out. Subsequent qPCR using primers that flanked the promoter regions of the Gli target genes HIP1 and BCL-2, or FAS
(negative control), revealed inhibition of binding by GANT61
of both Gli1 and Gli2 to their target gene promoters of HIP1
and BCL-2 but not to FAS, where no Gli binding sites were
detected (Fig. 6A). GANT61 (20 mmol/L; 24 hours) specifically
inhibited Gli-luc reporter activity in transiently transfected
HT29 cells. In contrast, neither p65-luc nor AP1-luc activities
were affected (Fig. 6B). In addition, using short, 1-hour

HH signaling in colon carcinogenesis, progression (6, 7), and
metastatic disease (8), there is limited understanding about its
mechanistic role in colon cancer. Primary human colon
carcinomas, liver metastases, xenografts (8), and human colon
carcinoma cell lines (12) express HH signaling pathway components. siRNA-mediated downregulation of Gli1 or Gli2 has
reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis in primary cultures of human colon cancers and liver metastatses, with the
Gli3R acting with greater potency. Furthermore, human colon
carcinoma cells transduced with Gli3R have failed to grow as
xenografts in nude mice (8).
In the context of colon cancer, previous attempts to block
HH signaling at the level of Smo has induced only moderate
cytotoxicity in these cells (36). A recent study reported

GANT61, a small-molecule inhibitor of both Gli1 and Gli2,
which effectively blocks Gli function (26). We have shown that
GANT61 induced considerably greater cytotoxicity in 6 human
colon carcinoma cell lines (60%–90% cell death) than that
induced by cyclopamine (30% cell death; ref. 13). These
findings indicate that direct targeting of the Gli transcription
factors downstream of Smo is more efficient in interrupting
HH signaling, likely due to noncanonical activation of Gli
proteins independent of Smo (5, 19–22).
Limited information exists about the genes or mechanisms
involved in the inhibition of the HH signaling response in
cancer cells. In an oral squamous carcinoma cell line, cyclopamine induced a modest (10%) increase in cells at the G1–S
boundary (37). Knockdown of Smo using siRNA reduced
proliferation of 2 human colon cancer cell lines, with
decreased expression of cyclin E and increased expression
of p21Cip1, consistent with accumulation at G1–S (38). However, no cytotoxic effects were described in either study. These
results are consistent with only modest cytotoxicity shown by
cyclopamine in human colon carcinoma cell lines. In detailed

www.aacrjournals.org

studies conducted in HT29 cells, inhibition of Smo by cyclopamine induced a modest increase in cells at the G1–S
boundary and modest perturbations in cell-cycle distribution,
with minimal entry of cells into the sub-G1 compartment, even
after 72 hours of exposure. In contrast, inhibition of Gli1/Gli2
downstream of Smo by GANT61 induced transient accumulation of cells at the G1–S boundary and in early S-phase,
followed by entry into the sub-G1 compartment. Previously,
cDNA microarray gene profiling showed upregulated expression of p21Cip1 mRNA and downregulated expression of genes
involved in the G1–S (CYCLIN E, CYCLIN A, CDK2, and
CDC25A) transition in HT29 (and GC3/c1) human colon
carcinoma cell lines treated with GANT61 for 24 hours (12).
Using bivariate flow cytometric analysis, accumulation of
p21Cip1, cyclin E, and cyclin A was observed in the G1 and
S-phases in contrast to cyclopamine-treated cells. Incorporation of BrdU also showed accumulation of GANT61-treated
cells at the G1–S boundary and delay in early S-phase without
further progression. Previously, it was shown in GANT61treated HT29 cells that the mRNAs of genes involved in
DNA replication, including thymidylate synthase, thymidine
kinase, topoisomerase2, E2F, and DNA polymerases, were also
downregulated at this time (12), supporting the lack of progression of cells through S-phase. p21Cip1 binds to and inhibits
cyclin–Cdk complexes with a preference for those containing
Cdk2 (39) and plays an essential role in growth arrest after
DNA damage (40, 41). Overexpression of p21Cip1 can lead to G1
and G2 (42) or S-phase (43) arrest. However, stable p21Cip1
knockdown had no effect on GANT61-induced cell death in
HT29 cells, supporting a p21Cip1-independent mechanism.
We have previously reported that GANT61-treated cells
showed modifications in genes involved in DNA damage
response signaling including H2AFX, MDC1, BRCA1, FANCD2,
CDC45L, DDI, and RAD genes (12). The present study characterized the DNA damage response elicited by GANT61mediated inhibition of HH signaling activity in human colon
cancer cells. In mammalian cells, there are 2 parallel pathways
that respond to stress-induced DNA damage: the ATM pathway, which responds to DSBs, and ATR, which responds to
DSBs and to agents that interfere with replication forks (44,
45). Both ATM and ATR are kinases that phosphorylate several
target proteins, are early transducers of the DNA damage
response (reviewed in refs. 46–48), and are recruited to DNA
break sites following activation (49). Checkpoint functions of
ATM are primarily mediated by the effector kinase Chk2, and
of ATR by Chk1, following phosphorylation (reviewed in refs.
46, 49). Efficient transduction of DNA damage signals downstream of ATM and ATR also requires a class of checkpoint
mediators and adaptors whose mechanisms are not yet completely defined (50). One of the earliest modifications of
chromatin in the DNA damage response is phosphorylation
of H2AX (gH2AX), a direct phosphorylation target of ATM and
ATR (46, 49), located at the sites of DNA strand breaks as
immunoreactive foci. Expression of gH2AX was detected by
both Western analysis and confocal microscopy by 24 hours in
GANT61-treated cells upstream of cell death. This was not
observed in cyclopamine-treated cells. A differential DNA
damage response evaluated in single cells in GANT61-treated

versus cyclopamine-treated cells was also determined by
COMET assay. The involvement of DNA damage in
GANT61-induced cytotoxicity was further substantiated from
the protective effect of nucleoside supplementation during
exposure of HT29 cells to GANT61, which would elevate the
pool of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP required for DNA
replication. Subsequent examination of the early response
genes, the activated forms of ATM and Chk2, showed the
appearance of p-ATM and p-Chk2 (but not p-ATR or p-Chk1)
at 4 hours following GANT61 treatment, which was sustained;
p-Chk2 nuclear foci were also determined in individual cells by
confocal microscopy (summarized in Fig. 7). No activation of
ATM, ATR, Chk1, or Chk2 was detected in cyclopaminetreated cells.
The role of the Gli proteins in colon cancer cell survival
was further confirmed using the C-terminus deleted repressor Gli3R to inhibit Gli1 and Gli2 activity. Transient expression of Gli3R over a period of 72 hours paralleled the effects
of GANT61 by decreasing growth and expression of Gli1 and
Gli2 in HT29 cells, inducing cell death, gH2AX expression,
and cleavage of PARP and caspase-3. Multiple human colon
carcinoma cell lines (HT29, SW480, HCT116) respond to the
exogenous expression of Gli3R (a C-terminus truncated
mutant of the Gli3 protein that localizes to the nucleus;

5912

ref. 3), by induction of immunoreactive gH2AX nuclear foci
in the same cells expressing nuclear Gli3R. These data show
the far-reaching consequences of Gli3R expression in human
colon carcinoma cell lines that express active HH signaling.
The GANT61- or Gli3R-induced DNA damage response is
also independent of p53, because expression HT29 and
SW480 express mutant p53, whereas HCT116 is p53 wildtype.
GANT61 functions in the nucleus to abrogate Gli function,
blocks both Gli1- and Gli2-mediated transcription, reduces
expression of GLI1 and HIP1 mRNA (qRT-PCR) in contrast to
cyclopamine in SUFU-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and
inhibits Gli1 DNA binding activity (electrophoretic mobility
shift assay; ref. 26). Further confirmation of the specificity of
Gli1 and Gli2 as targets for GANT61 is provided by ChIP
analysis, luciferase reporter assays, and inhibition of the
transcriptional regulation of BCL-2. In ChIP analysis, GANT61
specifically inhibited the binding of Gli1 and Gli2 transcription
factors to promoter regions of the Gli target genes HIP1 and
BCL-2 in contrast to that of FAS, which is not a direct target of
the Gli proteins, as early as 1 hour following GANT61 exposure. Treatment with GANT61 specifically inhibited Gli-luc
but not the activity of NF-kB (p65) or AP1 transcription
factors in luciferase reporter assays. Inhibition of BCL-2

specificity of GANT61 in targeting Gli transcriptional activity
in human colon carcinoma cells.
In summary, inhibition of the HH signaling pathway by
targeting the transcription factors Gli1 and Gli2 is highly
effective at inducing cell death in human colon carcinoma
cells in contrast to targeting Smo upstream of Gli. Inhibition of
Gli1 and Gli2 by GANT61 induced inhibition of DNA replication in early S-phase leading to DNA damage signaling involving an ATM–Chk2 axis and induction of cell death.
Pharmacologic (GANT61) and genetic (Gli3R) downregulation
of Gli1 and Gli2 by Gli3R reduced Gli1 and Gli2 expression,
reduced cell proliferation, and induced changes in cellular
morphology, DNA damage, gH2AX nuclear foci, cleavage of
PARP and caspase-3, and cell death (schematically represented in Fig. 7). The mechanisms underlying the induction
of Gli1/Gli2-regulated DNA damage, the significance of an
early S-phase response, and the inability to repair damaged
DNA are currently under investigation.
Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest
No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.

Figure 7. Schematic representation of the mechanisms underlying the
inhibition of HH/Gli signaling that result in cell death. Targeting Smo by
cyclopamine is upstream and less effective than targeting Gli1/Gli2 by
either GANT61 or Gli3R in eliciting cytotoxicity in human colon carcinoma
cells. Blocking Gli1/Gli2 function with GANT61 or Gli3R induces DNA
damage marked by the formation of gH2AX foci at DNA break sites. An
ATM–Chk2 axis is involved in DNA damage signaling downstream of
inhibiting Gli1/Gli2 activity. P, phosphorylation.
