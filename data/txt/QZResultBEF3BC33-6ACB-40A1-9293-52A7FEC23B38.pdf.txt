BACKGROUND. This prospective study was undertaken to evaluate patient and
treatment characteristics that contribute to hematologic toxicity in older cancer
patients.

METHODS. A nationwide study of 115 community oncology practices was conducted between 2002 and 2005 with data collected on 976 patients who had
received chemotherapy for common malignancies, including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, genitourinary cancer, and lymphoma.
Primary outcomes included severe neutropenia (SN) and febrile neutropenia

(FN). Secondary outcomes included delivered relative dose intensity (RDI) <85%,
dose delays 15% days, and reductions 15%.

RESULTS. Approximately 50% of both patients with early-stage disease and
patients with advanced-stage disease received an actual RDI <85%, and this rate
reached 60% in the oldest group (aged >80 years). Increasing age was associated
with lower actual RDI (P 5 .030) and averaged 87.5% across all elderly age
groups. A decreasing trend in SN or FN events occurred with increasing age (P
for trend 5 .039), with the majority of initial neutropenic events occurring in
Cycle 1 for all age groups. Among the patients who received an actual RDI 85%,
there was no significant difference in SN or FN by age group or disease stage. Independent risk factors for the development of SN or FN included cancer type,
planned RDI 85%, body surface area 2m2, anthracycline- or platinum-based
regimens, previous chemotherapy, elevated blood urea nitrogen, and alkaline
phosphatase. Neutropenic complications decreased significantly with primary
colony-stimulating factor (CSF) prophylaxis (coefficient of determination
[R2] 5 0.260; c-statistic 5 0.782).

CONCLUSIONS. Among cancer patients aged 70 years, 50% of whom received
relatively full-dose chemotherapy, increasing age alone did not increase the risk
of hematologic toxicity. Cancer 2007;110:1611–20.  2007 American Cancer

t has been established that age-related comorbidities and physiologic changes, such as declining renal and hepatic function and
progressive loss of total body protein, increase the risk of chemotherapy-induced toxicity in older cancer patients.1–3 The effects of
age alone on the hematopoietic system, though modest, become
more pronounced after age 65.4 Therefore, not infrequently, age
itself is perceived as a risk factor for chemotherapy-induced toxicity.
Planned chemotherapy dose reductions that lead to decreased relative dose intensity (RDI) are common, particularly for older patients
who are treated with anthracycline-containing regimens for breast
cancer or non-Hodgkin lymphoma.5–7 It has been demonstrated

that increasing age is an independent risk factor for
these substantial reductions in RDI.8 Dose reductions
used as a means of reducing toxicity may undermine
outcomes when 85% of the standard dose intensity
is delivered.9 Such dose reductions may compromise
disease control and overall survival, particularly in
patients with potentially curable malignancies.10,11
Controlled clinical trials have provided limited data
on hematologic toxicity and dose intensity of chemotherapy in the elderly. In the current study, we evaluated baseline patient and treatment characteristics
that contributed to hematologic toxicity in cancer
patients aged 70 years who were treated in a community setting.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
A prospective study of 115 community oncology
practices in the United States was undertaken
between March 2002 and March 2005 that included
976 consecutive patients ages 70 years. Stratified
random sampling based on practice size and geographic location was used to select sites for participation in this patient registry. All practice sites were
approved by institutional review boards, and all
patients signed informed consent. Outpatients were
enrolled before the initiation of a planned number of
cycles of chemotherapy. Pretreatment demographics
and clinical characteristics that were gathered on
each patient in the first 4 cycles of treatment
included age at diagnosis, weight, height, body surface area (BSA), comorbidities, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS).
Assessment of comorbidity for each patient was
derived from the Charlson Comorbidity Index.12 We
summed the number of comorbidities to derive the
variable ‘‘2 comorbidities.’’ Thus, no weighted measure of disease severity was incorporated into this
analysis. Treatment data included chemotherapy regimen and planned dose and schedule as well as information on neutropenic events, including occurrences
of severe neutropenia (SN) and febrile neutropenia
(FN). Identities of participating patients were kept
confidential and inaccessible to investigators through
the use of anonymous numeric codes. Major malignancies included lung cancer (27%), colorectal cancer
(14%), lymphoma (14%), breast cancer (13%), ovarian
cancer (9%), genitourinary cancer (7%), other gastrointestinal cancers (6%), other gynecologic cancers
(3%), and head and neck cancers (2%).
Clinical Outcomes
Primary outcome measures included incidence of
anemia (hemoglobin <10 g/dL); thrombocytopenia

(platelets <75 k/mm3); SN, which was defined as
neutrophils <500 cells/mm3; and FN (neutrophils
<1000 cells/mm3 and report of fever/infection). In
addition, planned RDI and actual RDI, compared
with the standard dose intensity for each chemotherapy regimen, were evaluated. Both planned and
unplanned reductions in RDI were calculated for
each drug and were averaged for each regimen. The
standard dose intensity for each drug is defined as
the established dose in mg/m2 per unit time (week).
Identifying the standard or established dose intensity
involved a comprehensive literature review of articles
and chemotherapy reference manuals commonly
used by oncologists in the process of selecting chemotherapy.13–21 If more than 1 possible dosing schedule or dosing interval was identified, oncology
experts for each major tumor type were asked to
identify the dosing schedule and interval for each
regimen that, in their opinion, was considered
‘‘standard.’’ Occasionally, when more than 1 potential
standard regimen was identified, the more conservative schedule was selected as a means of avoiding
overestimation of standards. The RDI for each drug
is defined as the ratio of either the actual or planned
dose intensity to the standard dose intensity. The
RDI for each regimen represents the average RDI for
each chemotherapeutic agent in a given regimen.
The planned RDI includes dose reductions, as determined by the treating physician, that take effect from
the start of treatment. Thus, the planned RDI differs
from the standard RDI when such dose reductions
are implemented. The difference between the
planned RDI and the actual RDI delivered forms the
basis for unplanned reductions in RDI and, as such,
represents subsequent reductions in dose intensity
that were not planned from the start of treatment.
Unplanned dose reductions most often are initiated
in response to some form of chemotherapy toxicity.
Secondary outcome measurements for the current study included the frequency of actual or
planned RDI <85% of the reference standard and the
incidence of chemotherapy dose delays 15% days
and dose reductions 15%. Dose reductions and
delays are ratios of the actual dose compared with
the standard dose and the actual cycle length compared with standard cycle length, respectively.

Colony-stimulating Factors
The frequency and time to the initiation of growth
factor use was monitored for every chemotherapy
cycle. Ninety-six percent of patients who received
growth factor received granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and the remaining patients
received granulocyte-macrophage–colony-stimulating

factor. Primary prophylaxis was defined as prophylactic colony-stimulating factor (CSF) administered
in conjunction with initiation of the first cycle chemotherapy. All other use of a CSF was considered reactive use. Information on CSF dose and duration of
use was not included in this analysis.

Statistical Methods
The distribution of each demographic and clinical
variable was calculated using appropriate summary
measures. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to compare the difference among patients ages 70 to 74 years, 75 to 79
years, and 80 years. The relation of each demographic and clinical variable with primary and secondary outcomes was assessed using univariate
analysis. The chi-square method was used for group
comparisons of categorical variables. Trends were
evaluated by Cochran-Armitage test. The RDI categorization was based on values <85% or 85% for
univariate and multivariate analyses. Logistic regression models for outcomes of SN and/or FN and RDI
<85% formed the basis of multivariate analyses.
The age groups and cancer categories were
included a priori in the models. The additional covariates were considered based on statistical significance and clinical relevance. Global model significance was based on the chi-square method,
whereas the significance of individual covariates was
based on the Wald statistic. Two-sided tests of the
null hypothesis were used throughout. The c-statistic
was used to ascertain the multivariate model’s level

of discrimination. The values of c-statistics range
from 0.5 (no discrimination ability) to 1.0 (perfect discrimination).

RESULTS
More than 3500 unselected patients have been enrolled in this prospective registry. We identified 976
patients aged 70 years for this analysis with a predominance of lung cancer, breast cancer, and lymphoma (Fig. 1). Forty-four percent of the patients
(44%) of were ages 70 to 74 years, 34% were ages 75
to 79 years, and 22% of patients were aged 80 years
(Table 1).
Approximately half of the patients (51%) had
potentially curable, nonmetastatic disease; and the
majority (72%) had never received prior chemotherapy. Whereas disease stage and ECOG PS increased
with age, the proportion of patients who received
previous chemotherapy and the number of comorbidities did not.
SN or FN over the first 4 cycles of chemotherapy
occurred in 210 of 930 patients (23%) who had
known hematologic toxicity outcomes. The majority
of initial neutropenic events occurred in Cycle 1 for
all age groups (14%) (Fig. 2). Table 2 summarizes the
risk of FN and SN or FN in the first chemotherapy
cycles and across all chemotherapy cycles. Baseline
elevation in alkaline phosphatase levels, along with
anthracycline use, was associated with a significantly
increased risk of developing first-cycle FN. In terms
of neutropenic events, in all chemotherapy cycles,

anthracycline use and female gender were associated
with significantly increased risk. Whereas prophylactic CSF use was not associated with a decreased risk
in first-cycle FN, it was associated with a significant
reduction in the risk of FN across all cycles (P 5 .02).
A decreasing trend in SN or FN events occurred
with increasing age (P for trend 5 .039). This trend
appeared to be driven by the group aged 80 years.
Although age alone was not associated with any
overall significant difference in rates of SN or FN, the
SN/FN rate for patients ages 70 to 79 years was
24.2%, and it was 16.7% for patients aged 80 years
(P 5 .022). Among the approximately 50% of patients
who received an actual RDI 85%, there was no significant difference in SN or FN by age group or disease stage.

FIGURE 2. Initial episodes of severe or febrile neutropenia in Cycles 1
through 4 by age group (P for trend 5 .039).

The planned RDI was established in 681 patients
based on recognizable regimens, doses, and schedules; whereas the actual RDI was defined in 657
patients. The mean actual RDI was 80% overall, with
336 patients (51.1%) receiving <85% of standard
dose intensity. Among 363 older patients with potentially curable, nonmetastatic cancer, 49% received an
actual RDI <85%, and 33% of these patients with
stage I through III cancers received a planned RDI
<85%. Older patients who received a planned RDI
<85% maintained an actual RDI <85%. Among
patients who began their treatments with a planned
RDI 85%, an additional 29% decline from baseline
RDI in subsequent cycles was observed, with a resultant RDI <85%. Among 556 patients who had an
ECOG PS of 0 or 1, 187 patients (33.6%) received a
planned RDI <85%. Among patients who had an
ECOG PS of 2, 3, or 4, 35 of 101 patients (34.7%)
received a planned RDI <85% (P 5 .84). Regarding
planned RDI as a function of comorbidity, 192 of 578
patients (33.2%) with 0 or 1 comorbidity received a
planned RDI <85%. There was no statistically significant difference between planned RDI in the patients
who had few comorbidities compared with the 30 of
79 patients (37%) who had from 2 to 4 comorbidities
and received a planned RDI <85% (P 5 .40).
Most of the planned RDI reductions did occur in
association with certain types of chemotherapy. Significantly more planned RDI <85% was observed
with taxane- and platinum-containing regimens. Significantly less planned RDI <85% was observed with
anthracycline-containing regimens compared with
nonanthracycline-containing regimens. Table 3 shows
both the planned and actual RDI <85% for major
clinical variables.
Age 80 years was associated with a lower actual
RDI (P 5 .017), although the planned RDI did not differ significantly among age groups (P 5 .097), aver-

aging 87.5% across all elderly age groups (Fig. 3). The
average actual RDI decreased to 76% in patients
aged 80 years, and 82 of those patients (60%)
received <85% of the standard dose intensity (Fig. 4).
Delays 15% and RDI <85% were more common
among patients who had stage IV disease compared
with patients who had early-stage disease (Fig. 5).
The use of anthracycline-containing regimens
was associated with a greater risk of SN or FN compared with nonanthracycline regimens (48% vs. 17%,
respectively; P < .001). The use of taxane-containing
regimens decreased with advancing age (36%, 35%,
and 28% for the groups ages 70–74 years, 75–79
years, and 80 years, respectively; P for trend 5 .050).

There was no statistically significant difference in the
rates of anemia or thrombocytopenia among the different age groups. This was observed in the older
patients overall and in the group of patients who
received an RDI 85%. Disease stage did not alter
this finding.
CSF was used in 34% of patients over the first 4
cycles of therapy, including 14% of patients who
received CSF prophylactically in Cycle 1. Although the
use of primary CSF prophylaxis was greatest among
the patients with lymphoma (25%), and the overall
use of CSF was greatest in patients with small cell
lung cancer (60%) and lymphoma (56%), there were
no significant differences in CSF use by age group.

calculate the actual RDI. Table 5 shows that significant predictors of greater reduction in RDI in multiple logistic regression analyses include a lower level
of education, the use of a platinum-based regimen

predictors of decreased reduction in RDI included
age (R2 5 0.174; c-statistic 5 0.701).

DISCUSSION
This report represents one of the largest prospective
studies to date of older cancer patients receiving systemic chemotherapy. In approximately 50% of the
patients who were treated with relatively full-dose-intensity chemotherapy, increasing age alone did not
appear to increase the risk of hematologic toxicity.
Nevertheless, fully half of the elderly patients in this
study who had common malignancies and were treated with standard regimens experienced major
reductions in actual dose intensity, including patients
with nonmetastatic, potentially curable malignancies.
Thirty-seven percent of patients with stage I through
III cancers in this study did not complete treatment,
primarily because of disease progression, and 45% of
the patients who did not complete treatment
received a planned RDI <85%. The potential for
compromised outcomes, including decreased sur-

vival, as a result of significant reductions in RDI does
not justify the objective of minimizing chemotherapy-induced toxicity, particularly in patients who
have responsive and potentially curable malignancies. Others have observed that the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy are similar for patients aged <70
years compared with patients aged 70 years.22,23 A
mortality reduction of almost 15% has been associated with the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in
selected older patients with breast cancer.23
In this elderly patient population, reductions in
planned RDI were associated with decreased rates of
neutropenic events, the significance of which was
greater over the course of 4 cycles of chemotherapy
compared with the initial cycle. These chemotherapy
dose reductions, therefore, may be perceived as
necessary to avoid incurring neutropenic complications. If no alternative existed to circumvent these
hematologic toxicities, then the argument to reduce
the dose at the expense of possible compromise in
long-term outcome may be justified. However, CSF,
which can mitigate neutropenic complications, was
administered prophylactically to only 14% of the
patients in this study. Despite this, prophylactic CSF
in the current study was a statistically significant
predictor of reduced neutropenic events. The benefit
of prophylactic CSF in terms of abrogating first-cycle
FN may have been underestimated because of the
limited use of this agent; nevertheless, the association between decreased rates of FN in subsequent
chemotherapy cycles was significant. Furthermore,
because the planned RDI did not differ significantly
among the older age groups, and a trend toward
decreasing neutropenic complications was observed
with increasing age, the decision to reduce the dose
of chemotherapy for most of these patients was
made presumably in reaction to toxicity. Randomized
controlled trials have demonstrated a significant
reduction in the risk of neutropenic complications
for older cancer patients in the setting of CSF
use.24–26 Neutropenic complications, thus, may have
been reduced further in this study through the more
judicious use of CSF.27 In the 42% of patients who
did not complete this study, the rationale was based
on factors pertaining to disease progression as
opposed to toxicity. Whether disease progression in
this study was the result of substantial dose reductions or of fundamentally chemotherapy-resistant
disease is unknown.
Independent risk factors for SN or FN among elderly cancer patients in this study included the type
of cancer, the type and dose intensity of chemotherapy, BSA 2 m2, previous chemotherapy, and baseline elevations in BUN and alkaline phosphatase.

Prophylactic CSF significantly reduced the risk of SN
or FN. An ECOG PS 2, 2 comorbidities, and age
were not statistically significant risk factors for the
development of SN or FN during chemotherapy. We
postulate that the lack of correlation between ECOG
PS or comorbidity and neutropenia can be ascribed,
at least in part, to variations in chemotherapy regimens, because less myelosuppressive agents may
have been selected for sicker patients. Alternatively,
our data may lack sufficient sensitivity to detect the
real impact of performance status or comorbidity on
neutropenia. Planned RDI did not differ significantly
between patients who had an ECOG PS 2 compared
with patients who had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Likewise, the planned RDI did not differ significantly
between patients with multiple comorbidities and
patients with <2 comorbidities. The lack of a perceived significant difference between patients with
multiple comorbidities or poor PS and planned RDI,
again, may result from insufficient power to detect
any real differences. The numbers of patients who
had multiple comorbidities and poor functional status
were much less than the numbers of healthier
patients who had optimal functional status. It is likely
that chemotherapy was not recommended as often
for more frail, functionally compromised patients.
Independent risk factors for actual RDI <85%
included increasing age, chemotherapy cycle length,
baseline elevated glucose and reduced serum protein, treatment with a platinum-based regimen, and
an education level 8th grade. Although the use of
anthracycline-containing regimens was a significant
predictor of actual RDI 85% in univariate analysis,
after adjusting for other confounding variables, such
as cancer type and increasing age, in the multivariate
model, anthracycline use no longer was associated
significantly with a reduction in actual RDI.
The finding that a low education level is a highly
significant independent risk factor for actual RDI
<85% is worthy of note. Others have described socioeconomic variables as predictors of reduced chemotherapy dose intensity.28 In this study, an education
level 8 grades may be a surrogate for frailty as a
result of possible suboptimal access to adequate
healthcare. It also may represent a form of treatment
bias on the part of the treating oncologist. Heightened awareness of such prescribing patterns may
contribute to optimizing RDI and, consequently,
improving outcomes in older patients.
Limitations of this study include the inherent
selection bias observed in analyses of observational
data. Although we observed no increase in risk of hematologic toxicity in the subgroup of patients who
received full doses of chemotherapy, this finding may

Chemotherapy RDI in Older Patients/Shayne et al.

have been subject to selection bias. The treating physicians may have selected patients who had a more
optimal functional status or fewer comorbidities to
undergo treatment with chemotherapy, thus avoiding
a recommendation of treatment for less fit older
patients. Further selection bias may have been introduced through inconsistency of data submission on
consecutive patients. Whereas data submission by
participating oncology practices on consecutive
patients was encouraged, it was not monitored closely in this study. This form of selection bias falsely
may suggest a decreased frequency of reductions in
planned and actual RDI, because preselected, more
robust, older individuals may be perceived as requiring fewer dose reductions. Furthermore, the actual
RDI may have been overestimated given a patient
drop-out rate of 42%.
Although the rates of both SN and FN were ageand planned RDI-dependent, no significant difference in the rates of anemia or thrombocytopenia
were observed among the different age groups in this
study regardless of RDI. These findings support a
stronger relation between the planned RDI and
effects on the white blood cell neutrophil series compared with the planned RDI and effects on red blood
cells or platelets. This may be caused in part by differences in life span between these hematologic cell
types. Chemotherapy-related anemia and thrombocytopenia may depend more on the duration of chemotherapy exposure than on the initial chemotherapy
dose intensity. Therefore, differences in the rates of
chemotherapy-related anemia and thrombocytopenia
associated with increasing age may have been underestimated by limiting the study duration to 4 cycles
of chemotherapy.
Another limitation of this trial includes the lack
of information concerning nonhematologic toxicities,
which may have contributed to unplanned reductions in RDI. Again, with only data pertaining to the
first 4 cycles of chemotherapy included in this analysis, there may be under-representation of the frequency of nonhematologic toxic events, which are
cumulative in the presence of sustained chemotherapy administration. The findings of this study also
may under-represent the more widespread problem
of under-treatment in this population of patients.
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data
from the year 2000 demonstrate that women aged
70 years with early-stage breast cancer were much
less likely to receive adjuvant treatment compared
with younger women. Furthermore, only 10% of
these older women received an anthracycline-based
regimen to treat lymph node-positive, estrogen receptor-negative disease.29 The influence of age is

1619

clearly a factor in the decision of whether or not to
recommend chemotherapy to patients. Because, in
our study, we evaluated only patients who received
treatment, failure by physicians to recommend chemotherapy when indicated solely on the basis of advanced age, thus, is a form of under-treatment that
this trial did not address. More randomized clinical
trials that include older cancer patients are warranted
to assess outcomes as well as patterns of toxicity in
this population.
