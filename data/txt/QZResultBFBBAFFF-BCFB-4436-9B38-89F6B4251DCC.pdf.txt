BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to investigate whether polymorphisms in DNA repair genes affect
clinical outcome of never-smokers with lung adenocarcinoma (NSLA). METHOD: Common polymorphisms in the
DNA repair genes ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1), excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1), and
x-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) were genotyped in DNA samples from 158 patients among 313
NSLA who were randomized to receive either gefitinib or gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GP) as first-line therapy. Immunohistochemistry for ERCC1 (n ¼ 38) and direct sequencing of the epidermal growth factor gene (EGFR) (n ¼ 42)
were performed using tumor samples. RESULTS: Patients who had the XRCC1 arginine (Arg)/Arg polymorphism at
codon 399 (399Arg/Arg) had a higher response rate to gefitinib (71% vs 36%; P ¼ .002) and had more EGFR-mutant
tumors (82% vs 29%; P ¼ .001) than patients who had the glutamine (Gln) allele. Patients who had the ERCC1 adenine-adenine (AA) polymorphism at codon 8092 (8092AA) had a higher response to GP than patients who had the
cytosine-cytosine (CC) or the CA genotype (100% vs 44%; P ¼ .043).When gefitinib was compared with GP, significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) was observed with gefitinib among patients who had the XRCC1
399Arg/Arg genotype (7.5 months vs 6.6 months; P ¼ .013), the RRM1 2464 guanine-guanine (GG) genotype (11.5
months vs 6.0 months; P ¼ .004), and the ERCC1 8092CA genotype (7.5 months vs 6.4 months; P ¼ .024). When the
3 genotypes were analyzed jointly, significantly longer PFS was observed with gefitinib among patients who had 2
genotypes (8.1 months vs 6.4 months; P ¼ .009), whereas a trend for longer PFS was observed with GP among
patients without the 3 genotypes (6.3 months vs 2.0 months; P ¼ .06). In a multivariate Cox regression model, the
greater number of specific genotypes independently predicted improved overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.8; P ¼ .006). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the XRCC1 399Arg/Arg, RRM1 2464GG, and ERCC1
8092CA genotypes did benefit from gefitinib. Having more of these genotypes may predict favorable prognosis for

Recently, we demonstrated that the first-line use of gefitinib improved progression-free survival (PFS) in neversmokers with lung adenocarcinoma (NSLA) compared with gemcitabine and cisplatin (GP) chemotherapy (hazard ratio
[HR], 0.8; P ¼ .04) in a randomized phase 3 study (First-Line Single Agent Iressa vs Gemcitabine and Cisplatin Trial in
Never-Smokers with Adenocarcinoma of Lung [First-SIGNAL]).1 Nevertheless, no significant difference in overall
survival (OS) was observed. Therefore, platinum-based chemotherapy as well as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) remain important treatment options for NSLA.
It is believed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNA repair genes modulate DNA repair capacity
(DRC) and may affect tumor response and prognosis. The excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1)
enzyme plays a rate-limiting role in nucleotide excision repair and has been associated with cisplatin resistance.2,3 It is
believed that 2 common polymorphisms in ERCC1, a cytosine-to-thymine (C!T) substitution at codon 118 (118C!T)
and a cytosine-to-adenine (C!A) substitution at codon 8092 (8092C!A), affect ERCC1 levels and are associated with
clinical outcomes in patients who receive treatment with various platinum analogues.4-8 Another key enzyme in DNA

synthesis and repair is ribonucleotide reductase M1
(RRM1), which catalyzes the biosynthesis of deoxyribonucleotides from the corresponding ribonucleotides and is
essential to the later stages of nucleotide excision repair.9
RRM1 over expression in lung tumors has been linked with
resistance to platinum drugs and gemcitabine.10,11 Two
polymorphisms located in the promoter region, RRM1
524C!T and 37C!A, have been associated with
response to GP chemotherapy and survival in patients with
nonsmall cell lung cancer.12,13 It has been suggested that 2
other nonsynonymous coding SNPs in exon 19, RRM1
2455A!guanine (G) and 2464G!A, are related to gemcitabine susceptibility in patients with breast cancer.14 The
x-ray cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) acts as a
facilitator or coordinator in base excision repair, which is
another DNA repair pathway. The XRCC1 arginine (Arg)to-glutamine (Gln) substitution at codon 399 (Arg399Gnl)
is the most common variant and occurs in the poly(ADPribose) polymerase (PARP)-binding domain and may affect
complex assembly or repair efficiency.15 Carriers of the variant Gln allele reportedly had higher levels of DNA adducts
and tobacco-related DNA damage.16-18 Theoretically, a
larger number of variant alleles of DNA repair genes should
confer impaired DRC and increased sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy, but the results are inconsistent.
Meanwhile, gene-smoking interactions for the associations
between DNA repair gene polymorphisms and the risk of
lung cancer have been observed consistently. In particular,
the Gln/Gln genotype of the XRCC1 Arg399Gln SNP and
the A/A genotype of ERCC1 8092C!A, which are associated with decreased DNA adduct removal, have been identified as risk factors for lung cancer in never-smokers but tend
to be protective in heavy smokers.19-21 These findings suggest
that there may be a striking difference in the phenotype of
DNA repair gene polymorphisms in lung cancer according
to smoking status. However, little information is available on
never-smokers with lung cancer. Thus, we undertook correlative analyses to determine whether potential SNPs in
ERCC1, RRM1, and XRCC1 modified the prognosis for
NSLA who received treatment with gefitinib or GP as firstline therapy. We also integrated results on polymorphisms
with data on ERCC1 expression and sensitive EGFR mutations to explore the predictive value of these SNPs in NSLA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Study Design
Full details of the First-SIGNAL study have been reported
previously.1 In total, 313 NSLA were assigned randomly

3202

to receive either oral gefitinib 250 mg daily or GP (intravenous gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8 and intravenous cisplatin 80 mg/m2 on Day 1) as first-line
therapy. Chemotherapy was repeated every 3 weeks up to
a total of 9 cycles unless there was evidence of disease progression or patient intolerance. The primary endpoint was
OS. Of 313 patients, 158 signed a second, optional
written informed consent for genomic DNA research.
The object of this correlative study was to determine
whether the different genotypes of DNA repair genes predicted response and survival. The survival data were censored at June 19, 2009. This study was conducted under
the approval of the ethical review boards and according to
guidelines for good clinical practice.
Genotyping Polymorphisms
Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood
samples using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, Calif) in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions. Genotypes of RRM1 (2455A!G, 2464G!
A, 524C!T, 37C!A), ERCC1 (8092C!A,
19007C!T), and XRCC1 Arg399Gln were identified
using the Taqman 50 nuclease assay for allelic discrimination and the 384-well ABI 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif) as
reported previously. The primers and fluorescent-labeled
probes for genotyping were available commercially as predesigned Taqman genotyping probes. The genotyping
results were analyzed by allelic discrimination plots using
SDS 2.2 software (Applied Biosystems).
Direct Sequencing of EGFR
Genomic DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded
tissues by using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen).
To detect EGFR gene mutations, exons 19 and 21 were
amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
directly sequenced according to a method reported
previously by Lynch et al.22 All PCR direct sequencing
reactions were repeated twice to confirm the results.
Immunohistochemistry
ERCC1 protein expression was evaluated by using a previously described immunohistochemical method.23 The
primary antibody was mouse monoclonal antibody antiERCC1 (clone 8F1; Neomarkers, Fremont, Calif). Cellular localization of the antigenic sites was determined by
2 investigators who had no knowledge of related clinicopathologic information. At least 200 cancer cells were
counted in 5 high-power fields. The staining intensity was

graded on a scale from 0 to 3. The percentages of positive
tumor nuclei were calculated in each specimen, and a proportion score was assigned (0, 0% positive tumor nuclei;
1, 1% to 9% positive tumor nuclei; 2, 10% to 24% positive tumor nuclei; 3, 25% to 49% positive tumor nuclei;
and 4,  50% positive tumor nuclei). This proportion
score was multiplied by the staining intensity of the nuclei
to obtain a final semiquantitative H score. The median
value of all H scores was chosen as the cutoff point for
separating ERCC1-positive tumors from ERCC1negative tumors.
Statistical Analysis
Chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests were used to compare
differences in proportions between groups for the categorical variables. Kaplan-Meier estimates and the log-rank
test were used in univariate analyses of PFS and OS.
Multivariate analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis with the significance
level for entering an effect into a model limited to P ¼ .1.
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill), and 2-sided P values < .05 were
considered significant.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Patients’ characteristics are listed in Table 1. There were
158 patients, including 14 men and 144 women, and
their median age was 57 years (range, 19-74 years).
Seventy-seven patients (49%) received GP, and 81
patients (51%) received gefitinib as first-line therapy. At
the time of disease progression, 60 patients (81%) patients
received EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib [54 patients] or erlotinib
[6 patients]), and 14 patients (19%) received nonplatinum chemotherapy (docetaxel [12 patients] or
pemetrexed [2 patients]) as second-line therapy in the GP
arm. In the gefitinib arm, 53 patients (79%) received
platinum-based chemotherapy, and 14 patients (21%)
received nonplatinum chemotherapy (gemcitabine plus
vinorelbine [12 patients], pemetrexed [1 patient], or
irinotecan [1 patient]) as second-line therapy.
The distribution of SNPs is also provided in Table
1. All variants were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P >
.05). Among 158 patients, tumor ERCC1 expression and
EGFR mutations were evaluable in 38 patients and 42
patients, respectively. ERCC1-positive tumors comprised
55% (n ¼ 21). Among 42 evaluable tumors, EGFR
mutations were identified in 23 (55%). Sixteen patients

exhibited an in-frame deletion in exon 19, and 7 patients
had the leucine-to-arginine substitution at amino acid
858 (L858R) point mutation in exon 21. No significant
correlation was observed between ERCC1 expression and
EGFR mutations. In addition, no significant correlation
was observed between patients’ clinical characteristics
(e.g., age, performance status, disease stage, and sex) and
genotypes, ERCC1 expression, or EGFR mutations (data
not shown).
Genotype and Tumor Response
The overall response to each treatment was compared
within treatment arms according to genotype, ERCC1
expression, and EGFR mutations status. In the GP arm, a
higher response rate (RR) was observed among patients
who had ERCC1-negative tumors compared with
patients who had ERCC1-positive tumors (88% vs 17%;
P ¼ .026). Patients who had the ERCC1 8092 adenineadenine (AA) genotype also had a trend toward a higher
RR compared with patients who had the cytosine-cytosine
(CC) or CA genotypes (100% vs 46% vs 41%; P ¼ .082;
AA vs CC þ CA; P ¼ .043). In the gefitinib arm, a higher
RR was observed for patients who had EGFR mutations
compared with patients who had wild-type EGFR (89%
vs 13%; P < .0001). Patients who harbored the XRCC1
399Arg/Arg genotype also had a higher RR to gefitinib
than patients who had the Arg/Gln or Gln/Gln genotypes
(71% vs 35% vs 43%; P ¼ .006). When comparing RRs
by treatment arm (gefitinib vs GP), patients with the
RRM1 2464GG genotype (88% vs 29%; P ¼ .041) and
those with EGFR mutations (87% vs 38%; P ¼ .026) had
a significantly higher RR to gefitinib compared with GP.
In addition, patients with the ERCC1 8092CA (41% vs
64%; P ¼ .05) and XRCC1 399Arg/Arg (54% vs 71%;
P ¼ .094) genotypes and those with ERCC1-positive
tumors (54% vs 13%; P ¼ .085) had a trend toward a
higher RR to gefitinib compared with GP.
ERCC1 Expression and EGFR Mutations
Within Genotypes
Because the RR to each treatment was affected significantly by ERCC1 expression or EGFR mutations, the
association with genotypes was examined. Patients with
the XRCC1 399Arg/Arg genotype, which was associated
with a higher RR to gefitinib, had more EGFR mutations
than those with the Arg/Gln or Gln/Gln genotypes (82%
vs 29% vs 0%; P ¼ .001). Although it is believed that the
SNPs examined here are related to DRC, no significant
correlation with ERCC1 expression was observed.

Patients who had the RRM1 2455AA genotype had
more ERCC1-negative tumors compared with patients
who had the AG or GG genotypes (73% vs 29% vs 50%;
P ¼ .056).
Progression-Free Survival
The association between PFS and genotypes is summarized in Table 2. In the GP arm, patients who had the
XRCC1 399Arg/Arg or Arg/Gln genotype had significantly improved PFS compared with patients who had the
with Gln/Gln genotype. However, the number of Gln/
Gln genotypes was too small (n ¼ 1) to reach a conclusion. In the gefitinib arm, the XRCC1 399Arg/Arg genotype and positive EGFR mutation status were associated
with prolonged PFS (P ¼ .034 and P ¼ .014, respectively). Patients who had the RRM1 2464GG or ERCC1
8092CA genotype also had a trend toward prolonged PFS
compared with those who had other genotypes.
When comparing the gefitinib arm with the GP arm
(Table 2), longer PFS was observed with gefitinib among
patients who had the XRCC1 399Arg/Arg genotype (7.5
months vs 6.6 months; P ¼ .012), the RRM1 2464GG
genotype (11.5 months vs 6.0 months; P ¼ .004), and the
ERCC1 8092CA genotype (7.5 months vs 6.4 months;
P ¼ .024). When 3 specific genotypes were analyzed
together, the greater number of specific genotypes was
associated with a higher RR (21% vs 60% vs 74%; P ¼
.001) and longer PFS (2.0 months vs 5.9 months vs 8.1
months; P < .001) in the gefitinib arm, whereas no significant difference was observed in the GP arm. When we
compared the gefitinib arm with the GP arm, patients
who had  2 specific genotypes had a longer PFS with
gefitinib (6.4 months vs 8.1 months; P ¼ .009). Conversely, patients without any genotype had a trend toward
longer PFS with GP versus gefitinib (6.3 vs 2.0 months;
P ¼ .063). EGFR mutation status and ERCC1 expression
were not significantly predictive of differential PFS.
Overall Survival
Because > 80% of patients in each arm received crossover
treatments as second-line therapy, there was no significant
difference in OS between the 2 treatment arms (data not
shown). Therefore, we analyzed the association between
these factors and OS among all patients. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the independent impact of each variable on OS (Table 3). The number
of specific genotypes was related to a favorable response to
gefitinib and had a significant impact on OS (P ¼ .01).
Baseline prognostic factors for better survival included

DISCUSSION
A lowered capacity to repair DNA (DRC) has been associated with higher lung cancer risk in never-smokers. The
XRCC1 399Gln variant allele is less likely to repair DNA
damage and has been associated with a higher risk of lung
cancer in never-smokers but a lower risk in heavier smokers.19,20 Recently, 1 study in 122 healthy Japanese workers
indicated that individuals with the Gln allele had significantly higher DNA adducts in lymphocytes among never-

3206

smokers or former smokers but not among current
smokers.24 In our study, patients who had the XRCC1
399Arg/Arg genotype, which is associated with intact
DRC, had a favorable response and gained a PFS benefit
from gefitinib. Moreover, this genotype was associated
significantly with sensitive EGFR mutations. These findings suggest that never-smokers who have the Arg/Arg
genotype, which is related to intact DRC, appear to
have relatively homogenous lung tumors characterized
by somatic mutations of the EGFR gene rather than by
the accumulation of multiple genetic and epigenetic
alterations, which may have lead to a higher response to
gefitinib and to improved survival.
It has been suggested that 2 common polymorphisms in ERCC1, 118C!T and 8092C!A, affect
ERCC1 levels.4-7 Nevertheless, to our knowledge, no significant difference in the ERCC1 messenger RNA level in
tumors has been described.25 Consistently, we did not
observe any significant correlation between these SNPs
and ERCC1 expression. Although no functional difference has been described for the ERCC1 8092C!A polymorphism, it has been suggested that this polymorphism
affects ERCC1 messenger RNA stability and, thus, may
be associated with lower DRC.26 Like the XRCC1 codon
399 polymorphism, a significant gene-smoking interaction was observed for this polymorphism. Compared with
the CC genotype, the AA genotype is associated with
higher lung cancer risk in never-smokers but with lower
lung cancer risk in heavy smokers. However, no

significant association has been reported between the CA
genotype and lung cancer risk in never-smokers.19 This
finding suggests that the ERCC1 8092AA genotype (but
not the CA genotype) may not repair DNA damage efficiently, which results in higher levels of DNA damage and
increased risks of lung cancer and cancer progression in
never-smokers. In our study, differential RRs and PFS
were observed in patients who had the ERCC1 8092C!A
polymorphism. When we compared gefitinib with GP,
patients who had the ERCC1 8092CA genotype had
higher RRs and improved PFS with gefitinib. Conversely,
patients who had the AA genotype had a trend toward
higher RRs to GP compared with gefitinib. When we considered only those patients who received GP as first-line
therapy, patients who had the ERCC1 8092AA genotype
had a trend toward higher RR to GP compared with
patients who had the CA or CC genotype. These findings
may support the well documented disparate role of DNA
repair in cancer susceptibility or progression and platinum
sensitivity.9
The RRM1  37C!A and  524C!T polymorphisms reportedly are associated with promoter activity;
however, no significant correlation with RRM1 expression has been reported. One retrospective analysis indicated that the RR37CC  RR524TT allelotype was
associated with improved survival in patients with resected
nonsmall cell lung cancer.12 However, another retrospective study in patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung
cancer indicated that the RR37AC-524CT allelotype predicted a higher RR to gemcitabine-based chemotherapy
but did not predict a survival benefit.13 In our current
study, none of these allelotypes had any significant association with clinical outcome, even in the haplotype analysis. Instead, we observed that patients who had the RRM1
2464GG genotype had a higher RR and a longer PFS
with gefitinib compared with GP. Although no functional
difference has been reported for the RRM1 2464G!A
polymorphism, an in vitro study has suggested that the
variant allele is associated with increased sensitivity to
gemcitabine.27 Considering the role of RRM1 in DNA
synthesis and repair, the RRM1 2464GG genotype may
have intact DRC compared with the GA or AA genotype,
which may lead to a higher RR and a longer PFS with
gefitinib.
In summary, we observed that NSLA who harbored
SNPs related to intact DRC had improved survival. We
also established that these SNPs are predictive of a benefit
from gefitinib rather than GP. Our findings support the
hypothesis that intact DRC may retard the molecular

events related to disease progression in already established
cancer by preventing additional DNA damage, which, in
turn, leads to a benefit from gefitinib treatment and
improved survival in NSLA. Limitations of this study
included the small number of patients, limited information on EGFR mutations and ERCC1 expression, and
lack of validation. Therefore, larger prospective trials that
further validate and refine the predictive and prognostic
utility of these SNPs are desirable.
