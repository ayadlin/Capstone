Integrated Genomic Characterization of Endometrial Carcinoma
The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network

Summary

Author Manuscript

We performed an integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic characterization of 373
endometrial carcinomas using array- and sequencing-based technologies. Uterine serous tumors
and ~25% of high-grade endometrioid tumors have extensive copy number alterations, few DNA
methylation changes, low ER/PR levels, and frequent TP53 mutations. Most endometrioid tumors
have few copy number alterations or TP53 mutations but frequent mutations in PTEN, CTNNB1,
PIK3CA, ARID1A, KRAS and novel mutations in the SWI/SNF gene ARID5B. A subset of
endometrioid tumors we identified had a dramatically increased transversion mutation frequency,
and newly identified hotspot mutations in POLE. Our results classified endometrial cancers into
four categories: POLE ultramutated, microsatellite instability hypermutated, copy number low,
and copy number high. Uterine serous carcinomas share genomic features with ovarian serous and
basal-like breast carcinomas. We demonstrated that the genomic features of endometrial
carcinomas permit a reclassification that may impact post-surgical adjuvant treatment for women
with aggressive tumors.

8,000 deaths in 2012.1 Most patients present with low-grade, early-stage disease. The
majority of patients with more aggressive, high-grade tumors who have disease spread
beyond the uterus will progress within 1 year.2,3 Endometrial cancers have been broadly
classified into two groups.4 Type I endometrioid tumors are linked to estrogen excess,
obesity, hormone-receptor positivity, and favorable prognosis compared with type II,
primarily serous, tumors that are more common in older, non-obese women and have worse
outcome. Early-stage endometrioid cancers are often treated with adjuvant radiotherapy,
whereas serous tumors are treated with chemotherapy, similar to advanced-stage cancers of
either histologic subtype. Therefore, proper subtype classification is critical for selecting
appropriate adjuvant therapy.

Author Manuscript

Several prior reports suggest that PTEN mutations occur early in the neoplastic process of
Type I tumors and co-exist frequently with other mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway.5,6
Other commonly mutated genes in Type I tumors include FGFR2, ARID1A, CTNNB1,
PIK3CA, PIK3R1, and KRAS.7–9 Microsatellite instability (MSI) is found in approximately
one-third of Type I tumors but is infrequent in Type II tumors.10 TP53, PIK3CA, and
PPP2R1A mutations are frequent in Type II tumors.11,12 Most of these studies have been
limited to DNA sequencing only with samples of heterogeneous histologic subtypes and
tumor grades. We present a comprehensive, multiplatform analysis of 373 endometrial
carcinomas including low-grade endometrioid, high-grade endometrioid, and serous
carcinomas. This integrated analysis provides key molecular insights into tumor
classification, which may have direct impact on treatment recommendations for patients, and
provides opportunities for genome-guided clinical trials and drug development.

Results
Author Manuscript

Tumor samples and corresponding germline DNA were collected from 373 patients,
including 307 endometrioid and 66 serous (53) or mixed histology (13) cases. Local
institutional review boards approved all tissue acquisition. The clinical and pathologic
characteristics of the samples generally reflect a cross-section of individuals with recurrent
endometrial cancer (Supplementary Table 1.1).2,3 The median follow-up of the cohort was
32 months (range, 1–195 months); 21% of the patients have recurred, and 11% have died.
Comprehensive molecular analyses were performed at independent centers using six
genomic or proteomic platforms (Supplementary Table 1.2). MSI testing performed on all
samples using seven repeat loci (Supplementary Table 1.3) found MSI in 40% of
endometrioid tumors and 2% of serous tumors.
Somatic copy number alterations

Author Manuscript

Somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) were assessed in 363 endometrial carcinomas.
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering grouped the tumors into four clusters (Fig. 1a). The
first three copy number clusters were composed almost exclusively (97%) of endometrioid
tumors without significant differences in tumor grades. Cluster 1 tumors were nearly devoid
of broad SCNAs, averaging less than 0.5% genome alteration, with no significant recurrent
events. Cluster 1 tumors also had significantly elevated non-synonymous mutation rates
compared to all others (median 7.2 × 10−6 vs. 1.7 × 10−6 mutations per megabase (Mb),

P<0.001). Copy number clusters 2 and 3 consisted mainly of endometrioid tumors,
distinguished by more frequent 1q amplification in cluster 3 than cluster 2 (100% of cluster
3 tumors vs. 33% of cluster 2 tumors) and worse progression-free survival (PFS, P=0.003,
log-rank vs. clusters 1 and 2; Fig. 1b).

Author Manuscript

Most of the serous (50 of 53 [94%]) and mixed histology tumors (8 of 13 [62%]) clustered
with 36 (12%) of the 289 endometrioid tumors, including 24% of grade 3 and 5% of grade 1
or 2, into copy number cluster 4; a single group characterized by a very high degree of copynumber alterations (Supplementary Fig. 2.1; focal SCNAs with FDR < 0.15, and
Supplementary Data File 2.1). Cluster 4 tumors were characterized by significantly recurrent
previously reported focal amplifications of the oncogenes MYC (8q24.12), ERBB2 (17q12),
and CCNE1 (19q12),13 and by SCNAs previously unreported in endometrial cancers
including those containing FGFR3 (4p16.3) and SOX17 (8q11.23). Cluster 4 tumors also
had frequent TP53 mutations (90%), little MSI (6%), and fewer PTEN mutations (11%) than
other endometrioid tumors (84%). Overall, these findings suggest that a subset of
endometrial tumors contain distinct patterns of SCNAs and mutations that do not correlate
with traditional tumor histology or grade.
As expected, tumors in the ‘serous-like’ cluster (cluster 4) had significantly worse PFS than
tumors in the endometrioid cluster groups (P=0.003, log-rank, Fig. 1b). Potential
therapeutically relevant SCNAs included the cluster 2 15q26.2 focal amplification, which
contained IGF1R; and cluster 4 amplifications of ERBB2, FGFR1, FGFR3, and LRP1B
deletion, which was recently associated with resistance to liposomal doxorubicin in serous
ovarian cancer.14
Exome sequence analysis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We sequenced the exomes of 248 tumor/normal pairs. Based on a combination of somatic
nucleotide substitutions, MSI, and SCNA, the endometrial tumors were classified into four
groups (Fig. 2a and b): 1) an ultra-mutated group with unusually high mutation rates
(232×10−6 mutations/Mb) and a unique nucleotide change spectrum; 2) a hypermutated
group (18×10−6 mutations/Mb) of MSI tumors, most with MLH1 promoter methylation; 3) a
group with lower mutation frequency (2.9×10−6 mutations/Mb) and most of the
microsatellite stable (MSS) endometrioid cancers; and 4) a group that consists primarily of
serous-like cancers with extensive SCNA (copy-number cluster 4) and a low mutation rate
(2.3×10−6 mutations/Mb). The ultra-mutated group consisted of 17 (7%) tumors exemplified
by an increased C→A transversion frequency, all with mutations in the exonuclease domain
of POLE, and an improved progression-free survival (Fig. 2a and 2c). POLE is a catalytic
subunit of DNA polymerase epsilon involved in nuclear DNA replication and repair. We
identified hotspot mutations in POLE at P286R and V411L present in 13 (76%) of the 17
ultramutated samples. Significantly mutated genes (SMGs) identified at low False Discovery
Rates (Q) in this subset included PTEN (at 94% with Q=0), PIK3R1 (65%, Q=8.3×10−7),
PIK3CA (71%, Q=9.1×10−5), FBXW7 (82%, Q=1.4×10−4), KRAS (53%, Q=9.2×10−4), and
POLE (100%, Q=4.2×10−3). Mutation rates in POLE mutant endometrial and previously
reported ultramutated colorectal tumors exceed that found in any other lineage including
lung cancer and melanoma.15–17 Germline susceptibility variants have been reported in

POLE (L424V) and POLD1 (S478N), but were not found in our endometrial normal exomeseq reads.18

Author Manuscript

The MSI endometrioid tumors had a mutation frequency approximately 10-fold greater than
MSS endometrioid tumors, few SCNAs, frame-shift deletions in RPL22, frequent nonsynonymous KRAS mutations, and few mutations in FBXW7, CTNNB1, PPP2R1A, and
TP53. The MSS, copy number low, endometrioid tumors had an unusually high frequency
of CTNNB1 mutations (52%); the only gene with a higher mutation frequency than the MSI
samples. The copy number high group contained all of the remaining serous cases and onequarter of the grade 3 endometrioid cases. Most of these tumors had TP53 mutations and a
high frequency of FBXW7 (22%, Q=0) and PPP2R1A (22%, Q=1.7×10−16) mutations,
previously reported as common in uterine serous but not endometrioid carcinomas. Thus, a
subset of high-grade endometrioid tumors had similar SCNAs and mutation spectra as
uterine serous carcinomas, suggesting these patients might benefit from treatment
approaches that parallel those for serous tumors.

Author Manuscript

There were 48 genes with differential mutation frequencies across the four groups (Fig. 2d,
Supplementary Data File S3.1). ARID5B, a member of the same AT-rich interaction domain
(ARID) family as ARID1A, was more frequently mutated in MSI (23.1%), than in either
MSS endometrioid (5.6%) or high SCNA serous tumors (0%), a novel finding for
endometrial cancer. Frame-shifting RPL22 indels near a homopolymer at Lys15 were almost
exclusively found in the MSI group (36.9%). The TP53 mutation frequency (>90%) in
serous tumors differentiates them from the endometrioid subtypes (11.4%). However, many
(10 of 20; 50%) endometrioid tumors with a non-silent TP53 mutation also had non-silent
mutations in PTEN, compared to only 1 of 39 (2.6%) serous tumors with TP53 non-silent
mutations. Though TP53 mutations are not restricted to serous tumors, the co-existing PTEN
mutations in the endometrioid cases suggest a distinct tumorigenic mechanism.
Comparisons of 66 SMGs between traditional histologic subtypes are provided
(Supplementary Methods S3) and SMGs across other subcohorts can be found in
Supplementary Data File S3.2. The spectrum of PIK3CA and PTEN mutations in
endometrial cancer also differs from other solid tumors (Supplementary Methods S3).
Integrated analysis may be useful for identifying histologically misclassified cases. For
example, a single serous case was identified without a TP53 mutation or extensive SCNA
and with a KRAS mutation and high mutation rate. Upon re-review of the histologic section,
the case was deemed consistent with a grade 3 endometrioid tumor demonstrating how
molecular analysis could reclassify tumor histology and potentially impact treatment
decisions.

Multiplatform subtype classifications
All of the endometrial tumors were examined for mRNA expression (n=333), protein
expression (n=293), miRNA expression (n=367), and DNA methylation (n=373)
(Supplementary Methods S4–S7). Unsupervised k-means clustering of mRNA expression
from RNA sequencing identified three robust clusters termed ‘mitotic’, ‘hormonal’, and
‘immunoreactive’ (Supplementary Fig. 4.1) that were significantly correlated with the four
integrated clusters; POLE, MSI, CN low and CN high (P<0.0001). Supervised analysis

identified signature genes of the POLE cluster (n = 17) mostly involved in cellular
metabolism (Fig. 3a). Among the few signature genes in the MSI cluster was decreased
MLH1 mRNA expression likely due to its promoter methylation. Elevated progesterone
receptor (PGR) expression was noted in the CN low cluster, suggesting responsiveness to
hormonal therapy. The CN high cluster, which included most serous and serous-like
endometrioid tumors, exhibited the greatest transcriptional activity exemplified by increased
cell cycle deregulation (e.g. CCNE1, PIK3CA, MYC, and CDKN2A) and TP53 mutation
(Supplementary Figs. 4.2 and 4.3). This is consistent with reports that elevated CDKN2A
can distinguish serous from endometrioid carcinomas.19 Approximately 85% of cases in the
CN high cluster shared membership with the ‘mitotic’ mRNA subtype.

Author Manuscript

Supervised clustering of the RPPA expression data was consistent with loss of function for
many of the mutated genes (Fig. 3b). TP53 was frequently mutated in the CN high group
(P=2.5×10−27) and its protein expression was also elevated, suggesting these mutations are
associated with increased expression. By contrast, PTEN (P=2.8×10−19) and ARID1A
(P=1.2×10−6) had high mutation rates in the remaining groups, but their expression was
decreased, suggesting inactivating mutations in both genes. The CN high group also had
decreased levels of phospho-AKT, consistent with down regulation of the AKT pathway.
The CN low group had elevated RAD50 expression, which is associated with DNA repair,
explaining some of the differences between the CN high and CN low groups. The POLE
group had high expression of ASNS and CCNB1, whereas the MSI tumors had both high
phospho-AKT and low PTEN expression.

Author Manuscript

Unsupervised clustering of DNA methylation data generated from Illumina Infinium DNA
methylation arrays revealed four unique subtypes (MC1-4) that support the four integrative
clusters. A heavily methylated subtype (MC1) reminiscent of the CpG island methylator
phenotype (CIMP) phenotype described in colon cancers and glioblastomas,20–22 was
associated with the MSI subtype and attributable to promoter hypermethylation of MLH1. A
serous-like cluster (MC3) with minimal DNA methylation changes was composed primarily
of serous tumors and some endometrioid tumors (Supplementary Fig. 7.1) and contained
most of the CN high tumors.

Author Manuscript

Integrative clustering using the iCluster framework returned two major clusters split
primarily on serous and endometrioid histology highlighting TP53 mutations, lack of PTEN
mutation and encompassing almost exclusively CN high tumors (Supplementary Fig. 8.1).23
We developed a new clustering algorithm, called SuperCluster, to derive overall subtypes
based on sample cluster memberships across all data types (Supplementary Fig. 9.1).
SuperCluster identified 4 clusters that generally confirmed the contributions of individual
platforms to the overall integrated clusters. No major batch effects were identified for any
platform (Supplementary Methods S10).
Structural Aberrations
To identify somatic chromosomal aberrations, we performed low-pass, paired-end, wholegenome sequencing on 106 tumors with matched normals. We found recurrent
translocations involving genes in several pathways including WNT, EGFR-RAS-MAPK,
PI3K, Protein Kinase A, RB and apoptosis. The most frequent translocations (5/106)

involved a member of the BCL family (BCL2, BCL7, BCL9 and BCL2L11). Four of these
were confirmed by identification of the translocation junction point and two were also
confirmed by RNA-Seq. In all cases the translocations result in in-frame fusions and
predicted to result in activation or increased expression of the BCL family members
(Supplementary Fig. 3.2). Translocations involving members of the BCL family leading to
reduced apoptosis have been described in other tumor types24 and our results suggest that
similar mechanisms may be operative here.
Pathway alterations

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Multiple platform data were integrated to identify recurrently altered pathways in the four
endometrial cancer integrated subgroups. Because of the high background mutation rate and
small sample size, we excluded the POLE subgroup from this analysis. Considering all
recurrently mutated, homozygously deleted, and amplified genes, we used MEMo25 to
identify gene networks with mutually exclusive alteration patterns in each subgroup. The
most significant module was found in the CN low group and contained CTNNB1, KRAS, and
SOX17 (Fig. 4a). The very strong mutual exclusivity between mutations in these three genes
suggests that alternative mechanisms activate WNT signaling in endometrioid endometrial
cancer. Activating KRAS mutations have been shown to increase the stability of beta-catenin
via GSK3beta leading to an alternative mechanism of beta-catenin activation to APC
degradation.26 SOX17, which mediates proteasomal degradation of beta-catenin,27,28 is
mutated exclusively in the CN low group (8%) at recurrent positions (A96G and S403I) not
previously described. Other genes with mutually exclusive alteration patterns in this module
were FBXW7, FGFR2, and ERBB2.29 ERBB2 was focally amplified with protein
overexpression in 25% of the serous or serous-like tumors, suggesting a potential role for
HER2 targeted inhibitors. A small clinical trial of trastuzumab found no activity in
endometrial carcinoma, but accrued few HER2 FISH-amplified serous carcinomas.30
PIK3CA and PIK3R1 mutations were frequent and showed a strong tendency for mutual
exclusivity in all subgroups, but unlike other tumor types, they co-occurred with PTEN
mutations in the MSI and CN low subgroups as previously reported (Fig. 4b).5,9 The CN
high subgroup showed mutual exclusivity between alterations of all three genes. Overall,
93% of endometrioid tumors had mutations that suggested potential for targeted therapy
with PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors.

Author Manuscript

Consensus clustering of copy number, mRNA expression, and pathway interaction data for
324 samples yielded 5 PARADIGM clusters with distinct pathway activation patterns (Fig.
4c, Supplementary Methods, S11).31 Paradigm cluster 1 had the lowest level of MYC
pathway activation and highest level of WNT pathway activation, consistent with its
composition of CN low cases having frequent CTNNB1 mutations. PARADIGM cluster 3
was composed predominantly of the CN high cases with relatively high MYC/Max but low
ER/FOXA1 signaling and p53 activity. Only TP53 truncation and not missense mutations
were implicated as loss-of-function mutations, suggesting different classes of p53 mutations
may have distinct signaling consequences. Paradigm cluster 5 was enriched for hormone
receptor expression.

Comparison to ovarian and breast cancers

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The clinical and pathologic features of uterine serous carcinoma and high-grade serous
ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) are quite similar. HGSOC shares many similar molecular
features with basal-like breast carcinoma.32 Focal SCNA patterns were similar between
these three tumor subtypes and unsupervised clustering identified relatedness (Fig. 5a,
Supplementary Fig. 12.1). Supervised analysis of transcriptome datasets showed high
correlation between tumor subtypes (Supplementary Fig. 12.2). The MC3 DNA methylation
subtype with minimal DNA methylation changes also was similar to basal-like breast and
HGSOCs (Supplementary Fig. 12.3). High frequency of TP53 mutations is shared across
these tumor subtypes (uterine serous, 91%; ovarian serous, 96%; basal-like breast,
84%),33,34 as is the very low frequency of PTEN mutations (uterine serous carcinoma, 2%;
HGSOC, 1%; basal-like breast carcinoma, 1%). Differences include a higher frequency of
FBXW7, PPP2R1A, and PIK3CA mutations in uterine serous compared to basal-like breast
and HGSOCs (Fig. 5b). We show that uterine serous carcinomas share many molecular
features with both HGSOC and basal-like breast carcinomas, despite more frequent
mutations, suggesting new opportunities for overlapping treatment paradigms.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

This integrated genomic and proteomic analysis of 373 endometrial cancers provides
insights into disease biology and diagnostic classification that could have immediate
therapeutic application. Our analysis identified four novel groups of tumors based on
integrated genomic data, including a novel POLE subtype in ~10% of endometrioid tumors.
Ultra-high somatic mutation frequency, MSS, and common, newly identified hotspot
mutations in the exonuclease domain of POLE characterize this subtype. SCNAs add a layer
of resolution, revealing that most endometrioid tumors have few SCNAs, most serous and
serous-like tumors exhibit extensive SCNAs, and the extent of SCNA roughly correlates
with PFS.

Author Manuscript

Endometrial cancer has more frequent mutations in the PI3K/AKT pathway than any other
tumor type studied by TCGA to-date. Endometrioid endometrial carcinomas share many
characteristics with colorectal carcinoma including a high frequency of MSI (40% and 11%,
respectively), POLE mutations (7% and 3%, respectively) leading to ultrahigh mutation
rates, and frequent activation of WNT/CTNNB1 signaling; yet endometrial carcinomas have
novel exclusivity of KRAS and CTNNB1 mutation and a distinct mechanism of pathway
activation. Uterine serous carcinomas share many similar characteristics with basal-like
breast and HGSOCs; three tumor types with a high frequency non-silent TP53 mutations and
extensive SCNA. However, the high frequency of PIK3CA, FBXW7, PPP2R1A, and
ARID1A mutations in uterine serous carcinoma are not found in basal-like breast and
HGSOCs. The frequency of mutations in PIK3CA, FBXW7, and PPP2R1A was ~30% higher
than in a recently reported study of 76 uterine serous carcinomas,11 but similar to another
study.12 Uterine serous carcinomas have ERBB2 amplification in 27% of tumors and
PIK3CA mutations in 42%, which provide translational opportunities for targeted
therapeutics.

Early stage Type I endometrioid tumors are often treated with adjuvant radiotherapy, while
similarly staged Type II serous tumors are treated with chemotherapy. High-grade serous
and endometrioid endometrial carcinomas are difficult to correctly subtype, and intraobserver concordance among specialty pathologists is low.7,34–36 Our molecular
characterization data demonstrate that ~25% of tumors classified as high-grade endometrioid
by pathologists have a molecular phenotype similar to uterine serous carcinoma, including
frequent TP53 mutations and extensive SCNA. The compelling similarities between this
subset of endometrioid tumors and uterine serous carcinomas suggest that genomic-based
classification may lead to improved management of these patients. Clinicians should
carefully consider treating copy number altered endometrioid patients with chemotherapy
rather than adjuvant radiotherapy and formally test such hypotheses in prospective clinical
trials. Further, the marked molecular differences between endometrioid and serous-like
tumors suggest that these tumors warrant separate clinical trials to develop the independent
treatment paradigms that have improved outcomes in other tumor types, such as breast
cancer.

Methods Summary

Author Manuscript

Biospecimens were obtained from 373 patients after institutional review board-approved
consents. DNA and RNA were co-isolated using a modified AllPrep kit (Qiagen). We used
Affymetrix SNP 6.0 microarrays to detect SCNA in 363 samples and GISTIC analysis to
identify recurrent events.37 The exomes of 248 tumors were sequenced to a read-depth of at
least 20×. We performed low-pass whole-genome sequencing on 107 tumors to a mean
depth of 6×. Consensus clustering was used to analyze mRNA, miRNA, RPPA, and
methylation data with methods previously described.38–40 Integrated cross-platform analyses
were performed using MEMo, iCluster, and PARADIGM. 25,31

Figure 1. Somatic copy number alterations in endometrial carcinomas

a, Tumors were hierarchically clustered into four groups based on SCNAs. The heatmap
shows SCNAs in each tumor (vertical axis) plotted by chromosomal location (horizontal
axis). Vertical color bars to the right of the heatmap show genomic features. b, KaplanMeier curves of PFS for each copy number cluster.

Figure 2. Mutation spectra across endometrial carcinomas

a, Mutation frequencies (vertical axis, upper panel) plotted for each tumor (horizontal axis).
Nucleotide substitutions are shown in the middle panel with a high frequency of C to A
transversions in the samples with POLE exonuclease mutations. b, Tumors were stratified
into the four groups by 1) nucleotide substitution frequencies and patterns, 2) MSI status,
and 3) copy-number cluster. c, POLE-mutant tumors have significantly better PFS, while
CN high tumors have the poorest outcome. d, Recurrently mutated genes are different
between the four subgroups. Shown are the mutation frequencies of all genes that were
significantly mutated in at least one of the four subgroups (MUSiC, FDR < 0.05, indicated
by asterisk).

Figure 4. Pathway alterations in endometrial carcinomas

Author Manuscript

a, The RTK/RAS/beta-catenin pathway is altered through multiple mechanisms that exhibit
mutually exclusive patterns. Alteration frequencies are expressed as a percentage of all
cases. The right panel shows patterns of occurrence. b, The PI3K pathway has mutually
exclusive PIK3CA and PIK3R1 alterations that frequently co-occur with PTEN alterations in
the MSI and CN low subgroups. c, Heatmap display of top 1000 varying pathway features
within PARADIGM consensus clusters. Samples were arranged in order of their consensus
cluster membership. The mutation spectrum for each sample is displayed below the
consensus clusters.
