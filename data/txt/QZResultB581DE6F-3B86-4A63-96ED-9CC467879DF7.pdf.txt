phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). A Phase II study was performed on
low-dose decitabine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, in combination with
imatinib in patients with CML in accelerated phase (AP) and myeloid blastic
phase (BP).

METHODS. Patients received decitabine 15 mg/m2 intravenously daily, 5 days a
week for 2 weeks, and imatinib 600 mg orally daily. Global DNA methylation was
measured by long interspersed nucleotide element (LINE) bisulfite/pyrosequencing.

Major and minor cytogenetic responses were observed in 5 (18%) and 3 (11%)
patients. The hematologic response rate was higher in patients without BCR-ABL
kinase mutations (10 of 19, 53%) than in those with mutations (1 of 7, 14%). Median duration of hematologic response was 18 (range, 4 to 107þ) weeks. Myelosuppression was the major adverse effect, with neutropenic fever in 9 patients
(32%). LINE methylation decreased from 71.6%  0.9% (mean  standard error

to 68.8%  1.4% at peripheral blood recovery. A decrease in LINE methylation
tended to be greater in nonresponders than in responders on Days 5 and 12.

T

he treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) was revolutionized by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate
(imatinib).1 Although imatinib is generally highly effective and well
tolerated, resistance to imatinib is increasingly recognized as a clinical problem, especially in patients with accelerated phase (AP) or
blastic phase (BP). The main mechanism of resistance is mutation
in the BCR-ABL gene.2 ABL kinase domain mutations are detected
in up to one-third of untreated patients with CML-BP,3 and 30% to
90% of patients whose disease progresses while on imatinib.4–10
Other suggested mechanisms include aberrant expression of drug

transporter system11 and gain of alternative pathways.12,13 Regardless of the mechanism of resistance,
the prognosis for patients who develop imatinib resistance is poor.
Aberrant DNA methylation can lead to carcinogenesis by silencing tumor suppressor or other critical
genes.14 In CML, DNA methylation increases in concert with disease progression.15 Reversal of DNA methylation has been investigated as a target for cancer
therapy.16 We have previously shown that decitabine, a
hypomethylating agent, has single-agent clinical activity in CML,17,18 including imatinib-resistant cases.
A combination of the 2 drugs for the treatment of CML
has become of interest because decitabine clearly
provides a distinct therapeutic approach from imatinib, and the combination therapy may exert an antileukemic effect in CML cells that are resistant to either
drug as a single agent. In fact, a recent study showed
that decitabine acts synergistically with imatinib in
the treatment of CML cells in vitro.19 With a hypothesis that the combination of decitabine and imatinib
mesylate will be a more effective regimen in CML-AP
and CML-BP than either drug alone, we performed a
Phase II study of decitabine in combination with
imatinib mesylate in patients with CML-AP and CML
myeloid BP.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Group
Eligible patients were required to have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of CML in AP or myeloid
BP, with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positivity by
cytogenetics or FISH analysis. Patients with CML in
lymphoid BP are treated differently (acute lymphomytic leukemia type chemotherapy) and were
excluded from this study. CML-AP was defined by 1
of following features: bone marrow (BM) blasts
15%, BM basophils 20%, BM blasts þ promyelocytes 30%, platelet count <100 3 109/L unrelated
to therapy, or clonal cytogenetic evolution. CMLBP was defined by BM blasts 30% or extramedullary disease. Other eligibility criteria were adequate
performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status 2), adequate cardiac
(New York Heart Association class III-IV excluded),
and hepatorenal functions (creatinine <2 mg/dL; bilirubin <2 mg/dL; hepatic enzymes <2 3 upper
limit), no prior therapy with decitabine, and negative
pregnancy test in women of child-bearing age.
Patients must have been off chemotherapy except
hydroxyurea and imatinib for 2 weeks before entering the study and recovered from the toxic effects of
the therapy, unless there was evidence of rapidly pro-

gressive disease. Patients previously treated with imatinib must have had evidence of imatinib resistance,
as defined by disease progression to AP or BP while
on imatinib in patients who initially had CML
chronic phase, or absence of at least a partial hematologic response (PHR, defined below) after 8 weeks
of imatinib therapy in patients who already were in
AP or BP at initiation of imatinib. Patients who had
never been exposed to imatinib were also eligible for
this study as long as they had CML-AP or BP,
because the single-agent activity of imatinib as an
initial treatment in such patients was observed to be
limited and short-lived if any. All patients gave written informed consent indicating that they were
aware of the investigational nature of the study, in
keeping with the policies of the M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center. Consent was also obtained for the
optional correlative studies, which included the collection of additional blood samples.

Treatment
Patients were treated with imatinib 600 mg orally
daily while on study. Decitabine was administered at
15 mg/m2 daily intravenously over 1 hour for 10 days
(Days 1–5 and 8–12), approximately every 6 weeks as
indicated by follow-up counts and marrow studies.
Use of hydroxyurea was allowed during the first 2
cycles of therapy.
Previous studies have repeatedly shown that decitabine works slowly, and that multiple cycles are
required for optimal response.17,20 Therefore, the
protocol recommended that patients complete at
least 2 cycles of therapy, regardless of response.
Patients experiencing grade 3 or worse hematologic
toxicity were evaluated for persistent disease. If myelosuppression was attributed to disease, the treatment
was continued at the same dose level. If myelosuppression was attributed to the treatment, subsequent
cycles were given at a dose that was lowered by 5
mg/m2/d of treatment. Prophylactic antibiotics were
recommended for all patients who became neutropenic. Growth factors were not routinely used, but were
allowed in patients who developed febrile neutropenia. In general, patients were treated every 6 weeks
for 2 cycles and treatment was continued beyond 2
cycles unless clear evidence of lack of response or
disease progression was observed.
Response Criteria
Response criteria were as previously described.17,21 A
complete hematologic response (CHR) required disappearance of all signs and symptoms related to disease, normalization of peripheral counts (absolute
neutrophil count 109/L, platelet count 100 3 109/L),

Decitabine and Imatinib in Advanced CML/Oki et al.

and a normal bone marrow morphology with <5%
marrow blasts. A PHR was defined as a CHR except
persistence of peripheral immature cells (<5% myelocytes þ metamyelocytes) or persistent splenomegaly or thrombocytosis that were reduced by 50% or
more from pretreatment levels. A hematologic
improvement (HI) was defined as a return to a second CP, referring to disappearance of AP and BP criteria. Cytogenetic responses were measured by Gbanding in at least 20 metaphases and were categorized by the degree of suppression of Ph-positive cells
as a complete cytogenetic response (Ph, 0%), partial
cytogenetic response (Ph, 1% to 34%), or minor cytogenetic response (Ph, 35% to 95%). Duration of response was calculated from date of first response
until recurrence. Survival was calculated from the
start of therapy until death from any cause.

BCR-ABL Mutation Analyses
The kinase domain of BCR-ABL was sequenced by a
nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method.
RNA was isolated from RBC-lysed total cells from peripheral blood or bone marrow by Trizol solubilization (Gibco-BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) and cDNA was
synthesized using 14 lg of total RNA, random hexamers, and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). BCR-ABL was then amplified
by 2 separate PCR reactions that cover amino acids
221 to 380 and 350 to 500 of the ABL kinase domain,
respectively. After purification of PCR products through
QIAquick columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), standard
dideoxy chain-termination DNA sequencing was
performed using Big Dye chain terminator reagents on
an automated ABI3700 analyzer and analyzed using
Sequence Analysis software V3.3 and the SeqScape
software V2 (ABI, Foster City, CA). All mutations were
confirmed by sequencing of forward and reverse
strands.
DNA Methylation Analyses
In patients who gave consent, peripheral blood was
obtained before or on the first day of treatment
(Days 0 or 1), at the end of the first week or at the
beginning of the second week (Day 5), at the end of
the second week (Day 12), and at recovery of counts.
After ficoll separation of mononuclear cells from peripheral blood samples, DNA was isolated using
standard phenol-chloroform extraction methods.
DNA was modified with sodium bisulfite.22 This
induces deamination of unmethylated cytosines converting unmethylated CpG to UpG without modifying
methylated CpG sites. In brief, 2 lg of DNA was
denatured in 0.2 N NaOH at 378C for 10 minutes and
incubated with 3 M sodium bisulfite at 508C for 16

901

hours. Treated DNA was then purified using the
Wizard cleanup system (Promega, Madison, WI) and
desulfonated with 0.3 N NaOH at 258C for 5 minutes.
DNA was then precipitated with ammonium acetate
and ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and
resuspended in H2O.
We used a long interspersed nucleotide element
(LINE) bisulfite/pyrosequencing assay to estimate
global methylation.23 After bisulfite treatment of
DNA, a 50 lL PCR was carried out in 67 mmol/L of
Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 16 mmol/L of ammonium sulfate,
10 mmol/L of 2-mercaptoethanol, 2.0 mmol/L of
MgCl2, 1 mM of dNTP mix, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase. The PCR primers were 10 pmol of 50 TTTTGAGTTAGGTGTGGGATATA-30 and 10 pmol of
biotinylated-50 -AAAATCAAAAAATTCCCTTTC-30 . PCR
cycling conditions were denaturing temperature of
928C for 30 seconds, 488C for 30 seconds, and 728C
for 30 seconds for 50 cycles to consume all the biotinylated primers. The biotinylated strand was captured on streptavidin sepharose beads (Amersham
Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) and annealed with
the sequencing primer 50 -GGGTGGGAGTGAT-30 .
Polymorphisms of T/C, which correspond to unmethylated and methylated cytosine of original sequence, were quantified by pyrosequencing using
PSQ HS 96 SNP Reagents and the PSQ HS 96 pyrosequencing machine (Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden).
It has been suggested that a cyclin kinase inhibitor, p15INK4B, may carry tumor suppressor function,
and that promoter methylation leading to silencing of
this gene has been most extensively studied in myeloid
malignancies24 including CML.15 We determined the
methylation status of the p15 promoter by bisulfitepyrosequencing. A 50-lL PCR was carried out using
the same PCR buffer as the LINE assay. PCR primers
used were 10 pmol of 50 -GTTTTTTTTTAGAAGTAATTTAGG-30 and 10 pmol of biotinylated-50 -TCCTTCTACRACTTAAAACC-30 . This set of primers specifically
amplifies the promoter region of the p15 gene. PCR cycling conditions were denaturing temperature of 928C
for 30 seconds, annealing for 30 seconds at a temperature of 608C for 4 cycles, 588C for 4 cycles, 568C for 42
cycles, and extension temperature of 728C for 20 seconds. We analyzed the methylation degree of 3 CpG
sites (96, 98, and 102 bp downstream from transcription start site) with pyrosequencing using sequencing
primer 50 -TTTTTAGAAGTAATTTAGG-30 . The methylation degree of p15 was computed as the average of 3
CpG sites.

Statistical Considerations
Simple descriptive statistics were used in the analysis
of clinical efficacy. Survival was computed using

The methylation data were expressed as a percentage
and showed a normal distribution. The data were
summarized (mean, median, standard error of the

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
A total of 28 patients were registered on this study.
Their clinical characteristics are summarized in Table
1. Eighteen patients had CML-AP and 10 had CMLBP. Twenty-five patients were previously treated with
imatinib mesylate and showed resistance to imatinib.

Fifteen of the 25 patients had previously received
other treatment regimens including interferon
(n ¼ 10), farnesyltransferase inhibitor (n ¼ 6), homoharringtonine (n ¼ 4), cytotoxic chemotherapy other
than hydroxyurea (n ¼ 4), and allogeneic stem cell
transplantation (n ¼ 3). One patient with BP and 2
with AP entered the clinical trial as their first treatment for CML. Mutation status of BCR-ABL kinase
domain was determined in 26 patients, of whom 7
(27%) carried mutations (Table 1). Among these
mutations, E450A has not been previously reported.
All other mutations were reported to be associated
with imatinib resistance.2,4,9,10 None of the 3 patients
who were never exposed to imatinib before study
entry carried BCR-ABL mutation.

Response to Treatment
A total 91 cycles, median 2.5 cycles per patient
(range, 1–12), was administered. Seven patients
received only 1 cycle of therapy because of rapid
progression of disease (n ¼ 5), recurrent subdural
hematoma (n ¼ 1), and patient’s decision because of
grade 3 diarrhea (n ¼ 1). Another 7 patients received
2 cycles of therapy and were taken off study because
of progression of disease (n ¼ 6), and patient’s withdrawal of consent (n ¼ 1). Fifteen patients received 3
or more cycles of therapy, and eventually were taken
off study because of disease progression (n ¼ 11)
and allogeneic stem cell transplantation after achieving CHR (n ¼ 4).
Responses are summarized in Table 2. Seven
patients with AP and 2 with BP achieved CHR. One
patient with AP achieved PHR, and 1 with AP and 1
with BP achieved HI. The overall hematologic
response rate (CHR þ PHR þ HI) was 50% (9 of 18)
and 30% (3 of 10) in patients with AP and BP, respectively. When analysis was limited to those who had
previously been treated with imatinib, the response
rate was 44% (7 of 16) and 22% (2 of 9), respectively.
A cytogenetic response was observed in 33% and
20% of patients with AP and BP, respectively. All but
1 cytogenetic responses were observed in patients
who achieved CHR. One patient who achieved partial
cytogenetic response (55% Ph) had persistent circulating metamyelocytes; therefore, the hematologic
response of this patient was categorized as PHR. Of
the 3 patients who were imatinib naive, 1 with AP
achieved CHR but no cytogenetic response, another
1 with AP achieved CHR and a minor cytogenetic
response, and 1 with BP achieved CHR and a complete cytogenetic response. Median cycles needed to
achieve PHR, CHR, minor and major cytogenetic
response were 2 (range, 1–4), 2 (range, 1–4), 2 (range,
1–4), and 2.5 (range, 1–6.5), respectively. Median duration

of hematologic response was 18 weeks, ranging from
4 weeks to 107þ weeks.
Point mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain
can contribute to imatinib resistance of CML cells. In
patients in this study, BCR-ABL mutation status was
determined in 26 patients, and 7 (27%) carried mutations in the kinase domain (Table 1). Among
7 patients with BCR-ABL kinase mutation, only 1
(14%) with E450A responded to therapy, achieving a
CHR with a minor cytogenetic response. Among 19
patients with no BCR-ABL kinase mutation, 10 (53%)
achieved hematologic responses (7 CHR, 1 PHR, and
2 HI), and 7 (37%) achieved cytogenetic responses (5
major CR and 2 minor CR). The difference in hematologic response rate (14% and 53% in patients with
and without mutation, respectively) was not statistically significant (P ¼ .18).
We next assessed whether the duration of offtherapy from imatinib (so-called ‘drug holiday’)
before the study entry would affect the response to
the combination therapy. Of 25 patients who had
received imatinib therapy before the study entry, 13
had been off imatinib for 30 days and 12 had been
off imatinib for >30 days before study entry (median,
165 days; range, 35–1460). Hematologic responses
(CHR þ PHR þ HI) were observed in 7 (54%) and 2
(17%) patients, respectively (P ¼ .05). Cytogenetic
responses were observed in 4 (31%) and 2 (17%)
patients, respectively (P ¼ .41).

Overall Survival
The median overall survival of patients with CML-AP
and BP were 56 and 15 weeks, respectively (log-rank
P ¼ .026, Fig. 1). In patients with AP, median survival
of patients who did and did not achieve hematological
responses were 93 and 18 weeks, respectively (log-

rank P<.001). In patients with BP, median survival of
patients who did and did not achieve hematological
responses were 81 and 11 weeks, respectively (logrank P ¼ .025). All patients together, median survival
of responders vs nonresponders was 86 and 16 weeks,
respectively (log-rank P < .001, Fig. 2).

Toxicity
Hematologic toxicities are difficult to assess in this
population because of bone marrow compromise by
leukemia. In 25 patients who had absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 1.0 3 109/L at baseline, 19 (76%)
developed neutropenia (ANC less than 0.5 3 109/L)

after the first cycle of treatment. The median duration of neutropenia was 13 days (range, 7–53 days).
Seven of these patients experienced prolonged neutropenia (>4 weeks) and had bone marrow biopsy
performed to assess whether the neutropenia was
due to drug toxicity or disease progression. None of
the 7 showed an increase in the blast count, and the
neutropenia was believed to be mostly due to drug
toxicity. All these 7 patients therefore remained in
the study and eventually proceeded to the second
course of therapy after neutrophil recovery. Overall,
9 (32%) patients experienced febrile neutropenia after the first cycle and received filgrastim. In 16
patients who had a platelet count 100 3 109/L at
baseline, thrombocytopenia was observed in 12
(75%) patients after the first cycle of treatment.
The median nadir platelet count of 12 3 109/L
(range, 3–798 3 109/L) attained at a median of
23 days after therapy. Eight patients required dose
reduction of decitabine for the second or later
cycles of therapy because of prolonged bone marrow suppression, presumably due to therapy. Other
nonhematologic grade 3/4 toxicity included central
nervous system bleed (n ¼ 2), gastrointestinal bleed
(n ¼ 2), diarrhea (n ¼ 2), dyspnea (n ¼ 1), and
edema (n ¼ 1). In 2 patients who developed grade 3
diarrhea the toxicity was potentially associated with
imatinib. The dose of imatinib was therefore decreased to 400 mg daily in 1 patient, who tolerated
the decreased dose well. The other patient chose to
discontinue therapy because of the toxicity. All other
patients continued to receive imatinib at 600 mg
daily while on study.

Methylation Changes
We used a LINE bisulfite/pyrosequencing assay to
measure global DNA methylation changes after decitabine. Peripheral blood samples from 20 patients
were available before and after therapy. Pretreatment LINE methylation was 71.6%  0.9%, and
methylation decreased to 60.4%  2.0% on Day 5,
60.5%  1.8% on Day 12, and recovered to 68.8%
 1.4% at peripheral blood recovery. We next analyzed the relation between induction of hypomethylation during cycle 1 and response. Figure 3 shows
methylation dynamics in responders vs nonresponders. The absolute decrease in LINE methylation
tended to be greater in nonresponders than responders on Day 5 (15.4%  3.9% vs 7.6% 
2.1%, P ¼ .14) and on Day 12 (14.4%  4.5% vs
9.3%  1.8%, P ¼ .34). This finding is consistent
with a previous Phase II trial of single-agent lowdose decitabine in CML.18 Finally, we also measured
p15 methylation by bisulfite/pyrosequencing and
found no significant methylation in any of the
patients at baseline.

DISCUSSION
In this Phase II study, we report on the safety and efficacy of combination therapy of decitabine and imatinib in patients with CML-AP and BP. Toxicities were
generally mild and limited to myelosuppression. The
response rates observed in this study were broadly
similar to the previous single-agent study of decitabine, where in patients with imatinib-refractory
CML-AP or CML-BP, decitabine induced CHR and
PHR in 26% and 13% of patients, respectively, and
major and minor cytogenetic responses in 13% and
26%, respectively. Although these 2 regimens were
not compared in a randomized study, the addition of

Decitabine and Imatinib in Advanced CML/Oki et al.

imatinib to decitabine in the treatment of advanced
phase CML seems to have limited effect. One possible explanation is that the synergy between imatinib
and decitabine depends on residual sensitivity to
imatinib, as shown in vitro.19 Thus, in patients completely resistant to imatinib, adding decitabine may
not be sufficient to reverse resistance. Consistent
with this, patients with BCR-ABL kinase mutation
seemed particularly resistant to the combination
therapy in this study. In patients without such mutations, the response rate to the combination therapy
is high enough to warrant further investigations.
The degree of hypomethylation induction was
lower in patients who eventually achieved a hematologic response than those who did not. This finding is
consistent with correlative studies in a previous Phase
II trial of single-agent low-dose decitabine in CML.18
Possible explanations for this phenomenon are 1) resistant clones may withstand more hypomethylation
without apoptosis; 2) rapidly dividing cells reflecting
more aggressive, poor prognosis disease take up decitabine more than those cells dividing slowly, therefore
showing greater hypomethylation; 3) decitabine may
exert clinical activity through mechanisms other than
hypomethylation.
We did not observe significant methylation of the
p15 gene promoter in any of the patients in this
study. Considering the method used for methylation
assay and the small number of patients analyzed, this
is not a surprising result because p15 methylation in
fact is infrequently observed when quantitative assays
such as bisulfite/pyrosequencing are used.18 The clinical responses observed in this study despite the lack
of p15 gene methylation suggest that the p15 hypomethylation is not required for clinical responses,
and that the mechanisms of response potentially
include hypomethylation of other genes or mechanisms other than hypomethylation. Therefore, analysis
of the p15 gene promoter methylation alone is not
a very useful marker of response to decitabine in
patients with this disease.
Our data suggest that a long drug holiday from
imatinib before the combination therapy in patients
with ‘imatinib-resistant CML’ is probably not beneficial, and may even be harmful for future disease
control. Our data are limited to draw a definite conclusion, but suggest that discontinuation of imatinib
in patients with ‘imatinib-resistant CML’ should be
carefully decided before the next therapeutic strategy
is initiated.
A new generation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs) is being evaluated in patients with imatinibresistant CML. Two agents in this class, nilotinib and
dasatinib, have shown activity in Phase I/II trials in

905

patients with imatinib-resistant CML.25,26 Nevertheless, activity in CML-BP continues to be limited, and
additional options are needed for this group of
patients. Based on the rationale for greater synergy if
hypomethylating agents are combined with TKI in
cells still somewhat sensitive to single-agent TKI,19 it
may be worthwhile to combine decitabine with 1 of
the new TKIs in CML-AP and BP.
