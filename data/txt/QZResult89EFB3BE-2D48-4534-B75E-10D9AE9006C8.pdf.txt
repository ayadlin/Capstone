Abstract
Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor in the development of
non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for 80%
of all lung cancers. Nicotine, the major addictive component of
tobacco smoke, can induce proliferation, invasion, and epithelialto-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in NSCLC cell lines and promote metastasis of NSCLC in mice. Here, we demonstrate that the
scaffolding protein b-arrestin-1 is necessary for nicotine-mediated
induction of mesenchymal genes vimentin and ﬁbronectin as well
as EMT regulators ZEB1 and ZEB2. Nicotine induced changes in
cell morphology and ablate tight junctions consistent with EMT;
b-arrestin-1, but not b-arrestin-2, was required for these changes.
b-Arrestin-1 promoted the expression of the mesenchymal genes,
as well as ZEB1 and ZEB2, through the mediation of the E2F1

transcription factor; this required Src kinase activity. Stimulation
of multiple NSCLC cell lines with nicotine led to enhanced
recruitment of b-arrestin-1 and E2F1 on vimentin, ﬁbronectin,
and ZEB1 and ZEB2 promoters. Furthermore, there was signiﬁcantly more b-arrestin-1 and E2F1 associated with these promoters in human NSCLC tumors, and b-arrestin-1 levels correlated
with vimentin and ﬁbronectin levels in human NSCLC samples.
A549-luciferase cells lacking b-arrestin-1 showed a signiﬁcantly
reduced capacity for tumor growth and metastasis when orthotopically implanted into the lungs of SCID-beige mice. Taken
together, these studies reveal a novel role for b-arrestin-1 in the
growth and metastasis of NSCLC. Cancer Res; 75(6); 1009–20. 2015

Introduction

(G protein-coupled receptors), they also regulate signaling by
Notch, endothelin A receptor, frizzled, smoothened, and T-cell
receptors (7–11). Our earlier studies demonstrated that nAChR
signaling induces nuclear translocation of b-arrestin-1 (arrestin,
b 1 or ARRB1) in a Src-dependent manner, where it recruited the
histone acetyltransferase p300 to E2F1-regulated proliferative
promoters, facilitating their transcription (12).
Nicotine can induce changes in gene expression consistent with
EMT, a signature of more advanced and less differentiated cancers.
The EMT program is a highly conserved developmental event
that promotes epithelial cell dissociation and migration to appropriate sites during embryogenesis (13); it also facilitates the
metastasis of tumors (14). During EMT, epithelial markers such
as E-cadherin (CDH1) and catenins are downregulated with a
concomitant upregulation of mesenchymal markers, including
vimentin (VIM) and ﬁbronectin (FN1; ref. 15). TGFb is known to
induce EMT robustly in many cell types (16). Here, we demonstrate that ﬁbronectin and vimentin promoters are E2F1 regulated
and the expression of these genes is induced by nicotine in a
b-arrestin-1–dependent manner. There was a direct correlation
between the levels of these genes and b-arrestin-1 in human
NSCLC samples. In addition, b-arrestin-1 regulated the expression
of EMT-promoting transcription factors such as ZEB1 and ZEB2.
b-Arrestin-1–depleted cells could not form tumors or metastasize
in SCID mice in response to nicotine stimulation. Our results
suggest that b-arrestin-1 plays a key and speciﬁc role in nicotineinduced EMT and metastasis.

Cigarette smoking is highly correlated with the development of
non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for 80% of
all lung cancers (1). Nicotine, the addictive component of tobacco
smoke has been found to induce cell proliferation, angiogenesis,
and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR; refs. 2, 3). In addition,
nicotine confers resistance to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents (4). Although nicotine is not known to initiate
tumors, it can promote the growth and metastasis of solid tumors
in vivo, suggesting that nicotine might promote the progression of
tumors already initiated by tobacco-speciﬁc nitrosamines (5, 6).
The arrestin family consists of four members, including visual
arrestins (arrestin1 and 4), which are expressed exclusively in the
retina and ubiquitously expressed nonvisual arrestins (b-arrestin1 and 2 or ARRB1 and ARRB2). Although it is established that
b-arrestins promote internalization and desensitization of GPCR

NSCLC cells were cultured in F12K medium with 10% serum
(Cellgro). H358, H1975, Calu6, H23, PC9, and H1650 human
NSCLC cells were grown in RPMI with 10% serum. A549 cells
stably expressing the ﬁreﬂy luciferase gene (A549-luc) were
obtained from Caliper and grown in RPMI with neomycin
(200 ng/mL). shRNA cell lines were made by stably transfecting
A549 cells with shRNA constructs that speciﬁcally target
b-arrestin-1 or a control vector obtained from a shRNAmir
library from Open Biosystems. A549 cells transfected with
empty vector (called shcontrol) were used as the control.
All shRNA cells lines were maintained in media containing
1 mg/mL puromycin. For treatment with nicotine or TGFb, cells
were rendered quiescent by serum starvation for 36 hours, and
subsequently stimulated with nicotine (Sigma) at 1 mmol/L or
TGFb at 5 ng/mL concentration. The TGFb receptor inhibitor SB
431542 was purchased from Cayman Chemical and was used at
1 mmol/L. For treatment with Src inhibitors dasatinib and PP2,
cells were serum starved for 36 hours and treated with nicotine
1 mmol/L for 24 hours in the presence of 0. 2 mmol/L dasatinib
or 0.5 mmol/L PP2.
Detailed experimental procedures for orthotopic lung tumor
model, migration assay, 3D culture, immunoﬂuorescence, Western blot analyses, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays,

section.
Constructs and transfections
Fibronectin (pFN 1.2 kb) and vimentin (VimPro-1.5 kb)
promoter luciferase constructs were kindly provided by Dr.
Jesse Roman (Emory University, Atlanta, GA; ref. 17) and Dr.
C. Gilles (Liege University, Belgium; ref. 18). The A549 and
H1650 cells were transfected using Fugene HD reagent (Roche)
following the manufacturer's instruction. Luciferase assays
were done 48 hours after transfection, using the Dual Luciferase Assay system (Promega) following the manufacturer's
protocol.
siRNA transfections and real-time PCR
For siRNA transfections, 50, 75, or 100 pmol of siRNAs
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with Oligofectamine were added
to cells. For real-time PCR, total RNA was isolated using RNeasy
miniprep kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer's protocol,
followed by ﬁrst-strand cDNA synthesis using iScript cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). Data were analyzed by the DDCt
method, where gene of interested was normalized to 18s rRNA,
then compared with the nontargeting siRNA control sample.
Error bars represent the SD of three independent experiments.
Details of siRNAs and sequences of primers used for RT-PCR are
given in Supplemental Methods.
Wound-healing assay
A549 cells were grown in a 6-well plate (Falcon Becton Dickinson) transfected with siRNAs. These cells were starved in serumfree media for 24 hours and then washed with 1 Dulbecco's PBS
(MediaTech). The cells were scratched with a sterilized 200 mL
pipette tip in three separate places in each well and medium
containing 1 mmol/L nicotine or starvation media were added to
the wells. After 24 hours, the wounds were observed and images
were taken in 20 magniﬁcation using Zeiss inverted phase
contrast microscope.

Invasion assays
Boyden Chamber assays were used to assess the invasive ability
of cells as described previously (2). The upper surface of the 6.5
mm ﬁlters (Corning) was coated with collagen (100 mg/ﬁlter) and
Matrigel (BD Biosciences; 50 mg/ﬁlter). Twenty thousand cells
were plated in the upper chamber with 0.1% BSA (Sigma). Media
containing 20% FBS was placed in the lower well as chemoattractant. The cells that invaded through the ﬁlters were quantiﬁed
by counting three ﬁelds under 20 objective magniﬁcations.
Statistical methods and analysis
A log transformation was performed to make mRNA expression values of four genes [b- arrestin-1, vimentin, ﬁbronectin,
and 18SrRNA] approximately normal. Pearson rank correlation
(r) was used to assess correlation among these three genes. An
exact normal scores test was used to assess the association
between mRNA expression values of these genes and pathologic
stage. The reduced monotonic regression model (19) was used
to assess the association between mRNA expression values of
these genes and smoking pack years. An optimal cut point for
disease-free survival, deﬁned as the time for surgical resection
to disease recurrence or death, was tested for using the maximal
c2 test. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS (Version 9.2; SAS Institute).

Results
b-arrestin-1 is necessary for nicotine-induced disruption of
tight junctions to facilitate EMT and invasion
We previously observed that nAChR stimulation results in
changed reminiscent of EMT (2, 20). To investigate the role of
b-arrestin-1 in this process, A549 cells that lack b-arrestin-1
were generated by stably expressing b-arrestin-1–speciﬁc
shRNA (shb-arrestin1); cells transfected with empty vector were
used as control (shcontrol). These cells were rendered quiescent
by serum starvation and stimulated with 1 mmol/L nicotine,
which is equivalent to the levels observed in the blood stream
of heavy smokers. Immunoﬂuorescence experiments revealed
membranous staining of tight junction protein zona occludens
1 (ZO-1) in quiescent cells; nicotine treatment reduced ZO-1
levels in shcontrol cells, but not in shb-arrestin1 cells (Fig. 1A,
top; Supplementary Fig. S1E). Selective knockdown of
b-arrestin-1 by shRNA and siRNAs is shown in Supplementary
Fig. S1A–S1D. Similar results were observed when b-arrestin-1
was depleted by siRNA in H1650 cells (Fig. 1A, bottom;
Supplementary Fig. S1F and S1G), suggesting that b-arrestin1 is necessary for reducing tight junctions upon nAChR activation. In addition to ZO-1, the levels of E-cadherin, an
epithelial marker, were signiﬁcantly decreased upon nicotine
stimulation only in shcontrol cells but not in shb-arrestin1 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). Shcontrol cells and shbarrestin-1 cells were grown as 3D cultures on collagen in the
presence or absence of nicotine; shcontrol cells treated with
nicotine acquired a more elongated, migratory morphology,
but shb-arrestin1 cells did not show such changes (Fig. 1B).
Shb-arrestin1 cells were also impaired in their ability to migrate
(Supplementary Fig. S2C) or invade in response to nicotine
stimulation (Fig. 1C). Depletion of b-arrestin-1 impaired nicotine-mediated invasion of a variety of NSCLC cell lines (Fig.
1D), indicating a deﬁnite role for b-arrestin-1 in the induction
of mesenchymal features in response to nAChR signaling.

We examined whether b-arrestin-1 regulates the expression

nAChR stimulation. Western blotting showed that nicotine
treatment induced the expression of ﬁbronectin and vimentin
in shcontrol cells, but not in shb-arrestin1 cells (Fig. 2A); this
induction occurred at the transcriptional level (Fig. 2B). In

contrast, depletion of b-arrestin-1 did not alter TGFb-mediated
vimentin or ﬁbronectin expression, suggesting that b-arrestin-1
plays a role in mediating EMT downstream of nAChRs. Transient transfection assays were then conducted using luciferase
reporter constructs driven by human vimentin and ﬁbronectin
promoters. Shcontrol and shb-arrestin1 cells were transfected
with the reporters, rendered quiescent by serum starvation,
and stimulated with nicotine or TGFb. Both promoters were

a closely related arrestin, did not play a role in nicotine-induced

b-Arrestin-1–Mediated Induction of EMT

Because nicotine induces cell proliferation by a7nAChR
(CHRNA7)-mediated activation of Src, experiments were conducted to assess whether they contribute to the induction of
these mesenchymal promoters. Western blot analysis (Fig. 2F)
and RT-PCR (Fig. 2G) showed that depletion of Src and
a7nAChR by siRNAs abrogated induction of vimentin and
ﬁbronectin by nicotine, but not TGFb. Since nicotine is known
to induce TGFb in certain cell lines (21, 22), we examined
whether nAChR-mediated mesenchymal gene expression is
indirectly mediated through the activation of the TGFb pathway. A549 cells were serum starved and treated with nicotine or
TGFb in the presence or absence of TGFb1 receptor inhibitor
SB431542. SB431542 abrogated the induction of vimentin and
ﬁbronectin expression by TGFb but not nicotine (Fig. 2H),
suggesting that nicotine-mediated induction of these genes is
independent of TGFb. To further establish the role of b-arrestin1 in nicotine-induced EMT, we determined the levels of tight
junction protein ZO-1 and epithelial markers E-cadherin and
b-catenin from membrane fractions of shcontrol and shbarrestin1 cells. As seen in Fig. 2I, nicotine treatment decreased
the levels of E-cadherin, b-catenin, and ZO-1 in shcontrol cells,
but not in shb-arrestin1 cells.
Vimentin and ﬁbronectin promoters are E2F1 and Rb
responsive
Recent studies have indicated that E2Fs function in a wide
range of biologic processes in addition to cell-cycle progression
(23–26). Because b-arrestin-1 interacts with E2F1 (12),
attempts were made to assess whether E2F transcription factors
played a role in the induction of ﬁbronectin and vimentin
during EMT. An analysis of the promoter regions (1 kb)
upstream of transcription start site using MatInspector program
(Genomatix) revealed the presence of six potential E2F-binding
sites on the vimentin promoter (Supplementary Fig. S4A)
and two sites on the ﬁbronectin promoter (Supplementary
Table S1).
ChIP assays conducted on A549 cells detected the binding of
E2F1 and Rb to vimentin and ﬁbronectin promoters (Supplementary Fig. S4B); further, transient transfection experiments
showed that E2F1 could induce using vimentin-Luc and ﬁbronectin-Luc reporters, while Rb suppressed this induction (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Similar results were obtained in additional
NSCLC cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S4D and S4E). Although
E2Fs 2–5 could also induce these promoters, E2F1 had the
maximal effect (Supplementary Fig. S3F). Supporting these
results, transfection of 75 pmols of an E2F1 siRNA signiﬁcantly
reduced the levels of endogenous vimentin and ﬁbronectin,
(Supplementary Fig. S4G and S4H).
Transient transfections were conducted using deletion
mutants of vimentin promoter to ﬁne map the promoter region
required for E2F-mediated induction (Supplementary Fig.
S5A); it was found that the full-length promoter (1.5kb; six
E2F-binding sites) and the deletion mutant vim-387þ24 (Vim411; three sites) could be transcriptionally induced by E2F1,
but the shortest mutant vim-245þ24 (Vim-269) was not E2F1
responsive (Supplementary Fig. S5B), suggesting that the three
proximal sites were sufﬁcient for E2F-mediated transcriptional
induction. Similar experiments on the deletion mutants of
ﬁbronectin promoter revealed that only a proximal binding
site was necessary for induction by E2F1 (Supplementary Fig.
S5C and S5D); this was conﬁrmed by mutating this site (Sup-

www.aacrjournals.org

plementary Fig. S5E). These experiments demonstrate a direct
role for E2F1 in regulating these mesenchymal promoters.
nAChR stimulation leads to recruitment of E2F1 and b-arrestin1 on ﬁbronectin and vimentin promoters
Because nAChR stimulation induced the nuclear translocation of a subset of b-arrestin-1 (12), ChIP assays were conducted to determine whether it could associate with vimentin
and ﬁbronectin promoters. A549 cells were serum starved and
stimulated with nicotine; quiescent cells had robust amount of
Rb on these promoters. Nicotine stimulation led to an increase
in the association of E2F1 and b-arrestin-1 with a concomitant
dissociation of Rb from these promoters (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S6). ChIP assays followed by real-time PCR also
showed the increased association of E2F1, b-arrestin-1, p300,
and Ac-H3 with vimentin and ﬁbronectin promoters in nicotine-treated shcontrol cells, but not on shb-arrestin1 cells.
Furthermore, Rb was present on vimentin and ﬁbronectin
promoters in shb-arrestin1 cells even after nicotine stimulation
(Fig. 3B). An unrelated promoter, c-Fos, was used as the
negative control and there was only minimal association of
E2F1, Rb, b-arrestin-1, p300, and Ac-H3 on this promoter
(Supplementary Fig. S7); further, the ﬁbronectin and vimentin
promoters could not be detected in immunoprecipitations
performed with a control irrelevant antibody (IgG), conﬁrming
the speciﬁcity of the assay. These results suggest that b-arrestin1–mediated signaling events facilitated the dissociation of Rb
and enhanced recruitment of E2F1, p300, and acetylation of
histones on vimentin and ﬁbronectin promoters.
To examine whether nicotine- or TGFb-induced expression of
these mesenchymal markers is dependent on E2F1, we transfected
A549 cells with control siRNA or two different E2F1 siRNAs, and
stimulated with nicotine or TGFb. Western blotting (Fig. 3C and
D) and RT-PCR showed that (Fig. 3E) E2F1 was necessary for
nicotine-mediated, but not TGFb-mediated, induction of vimentin and ﬁbronectin. To assess whether b-arrestin-1 is required for
the transcriptional induction of these promoters by E2F1, shcontrol and shb-arrestin1 cells were transfected with vimentin or
ﬁbronectin promoter constructs along with E2F1. Interestingly,
ﬁbronectin and vimentin promoters were induced by E2F1 in
shcontrol cells but not in shb-arrestin1 cells (Fig. 3F and G),
suggesting that b-arrestin-1 was necessary for the E2F1-mediated
transcription of these genes. Experiments on control siRNA or
E2F1 siRNA-transfected cells also showed that E2F1 was required
for the induction of vimentin and ﬁbronectin promoters upon
nicotine stimulation, but not TGFb stimulation (Fig. 3H and I).
Collectively these results indicate that E2F1 and b-arrestin-1 are
required for the nAChR-mediated, but not TGFbmediated, expression of ﬁbronectin and vimentin.
Nuclear function of b-arrestin-1 is necessary for induction of
EMT
To examine whether nuclear translocation of b-arrestin-1 regulates the expression of mesenchymal genes, we performed transient transfection assays using the b-arrestin-1–mutant Q394L, in
which glutamine 394 has been mutated to leucine to create a
nuclear export signal (27, 28). The mutant Q394L did not
enhance E2F1-mediated transcription from ﬁbronectin and
vimentin promoters, suggesting that nuclear translocation of
b-arrestin-1 is required for the transcription of these genes
(Fig. 4A).

To further explore the requirement of the nuclear function
of b-arrestin-1 in inducing EMT, shb-arrestin1 cells were transfected with pcDNA3, WT-b-arrestin1-RFP, or Q394L-b-arrestin-1
constructs. Shcontrol cells transfected with pcDNA3 were used as
the control. As shown in Fig. 4B, nicotine-induced expression of
ﬁbronectin and vimentin in Shb-arrestin1 cells was rescued by the
WT-b-arrestin-1-RFP construct but not the Q394L-b-arrestin-1
construct. Furthermore, WT-b-arrestin-1, but not Q394Lb-arrestin-1 could rescue the nicotine-induced migration and
invasion (Fig. 4C and D) of shb-arrestin1 cells, supporting the
contention that b-arrestin-1 facilitates the transcriptional induction of mesenchymal genes upon nicotine stimulation. The level
of b-arrestin-1 after rescue was examined by RT-PCR and Western
blot analyses (Supplementary Fig. S8A–S8C).

We next examined whether nuclear functions of b-arrestin-1
require Src activity. A549 and H1650 cells were transfected with
vimentin and ﬁbronectin promoters along with a dominant
negative or constitutively active Src expression vector. Luciferase
assays revealed that dominant negative Src inhibited transactivation of these promoters (Fig. 4E) by E2F1. In addition, Src
inhibitors dasatinib and PP2 could strongly inhibit E2F1 and
b-arrestin-1–mediated transcription of ﬁbronectin and vimentin
reporters (Fig. 4F), suggesting that Src was necessary for the
nuclear functions of b-arrestin-1. In addition, we performed ChIP
assays on A549 cells treated with nicotine in the presence or
absence of dasatinib and PP2. Nicotine treatment enhanced
recruitment of E2F1, b-arrestin-1, and p300 on these promoters
with concomitant release of Rb; these effects were abrogated in

cells treated with the two Src inhibitors (Fig. 4G and H). Though
less speciﬁc than dasatinib, treatment with both the agents led to a
near complete dissociation of Rb, E2F1 b-arrestin-1, and p300
from the vimentin promoter; a minimal amount of Rb, comparable with that present in serum-starved cells, was retained on the
FN promoter. There was no detectable ampliﬁcation of the
promoters in a control IP conducted with normal IgG, and these
proteins were not associated with the unrelated c-Fos promoter.
These results indicate that Src-mediated signaling events facilitate
the nicotine-mediated induction of these promoters, by targeting
Rb, E2F1 and b-arrestin-1.

E2F1–b-arrestin-1 interaction is necessary for the expression of
mesenchymal genes
Previous studies from our laboratory had shown that amino acids
1-163 of b-arrestin-1 were required for its binding to E2F1 (Supplementary data in ref. 12). We conducted IP–Western blot assays to
determine whether delivery of the 1-163 fragment of b-arrestin-1
disrupts the binding of endogenous E2F1 to b-arrestin-1. A549 cells
were transfected with either the control vector (pcDNA3) or two
levels of pcDNA3-b-arrestin-1 1-163 construct (4 mg or 8 mg). IPWestern blots showed that the binding of endogenous E2F1 and
b-arrestin-1 was disrupted by b-arrestin-1 1-163 construct in a dose-

dependent manner (Fig. 5A). Similar results were obtained when we
overexpressed E2F1 and WT-b-arrestin-1 along with two different
levels of b-arrestin-1 1-163 fragment (Fig. 5B).
We next examined whether disrupting the binding of b-arrestin1 prevented the E2F-1–mediated induction of vimentin and
ﬁbronectin. A549 cells were transfected with the promoter luciferase constructs along with E2F1 and b-arrestin-1 alone or with
different levels of b-arrestin-1 1-163; cotransfection of b-arrestin-1
1-163 abrogated promoter induction by E2F1 (Fig. 5C), suggesting that binding of b-arrestin-1 is necessary for E2F1-mediated
induction of vimentin and ﬁbronectin.
We performed functional assays to explore whether binding of
b-arrestin-1 to E2F1 is required for nicotine-induced EMT. A549
cells were transfected with either pcDNA3 or b-arrestin-1 1-163
fragment, serum starved for 24 hours, and subsequently induced
with 1 mmol/L nicotine. As seen in Fig. 5D, b-arrestin-1 1-163
fragment could effectively inhibit nicotine-mediated expression
of vimentin and ﬁbronectin, as well as nicotine-mediated invasion (Fig. 5E) and migration (Fig. 5F) of cells. In conclusion,
disruption of E2F1- b-arrestin-1 binding by b-arrestin-1 1-163
fragment could signiﬁcantly prevent nicotine-mediated mesenchymal gene expression, invasion, and migration of cells.
b-Arrestin-1 mediates the induction of EMT-promoting
transcription factors
Attempts were made to analyze the global association of
b-arrestin-1 with promoters upon nicotine stimulation by ChIP

sequencing. It was found that b-arrestin-1 is recruited on the
promoters of many genes that regulate EMT such as ZEB2 as well
as other regulatory pathways (Supplementary Table S2; GEO
accession number GSE40689). Because ZEB1 and ZEB2 are
involved in the repression of epithelial genes during EMT, it was
examined whether b-arrestin-1 contributes to the expression of
these factors. Real-time PCR experiments showed that ZEB1 and
ZEB2 are upregulated by nAChR stimulation and b-arrestin-1 was
necessary for this (Supplementary Fig. S9A–S9F).
Because b-arrestin-1 does not possess a DNA-binding domain,
we hypothesized that b-arrestin-1 associates with these promoters
probably through E2F1. It was found that ZEB1 had six and ZEB2
had two E2F-binding sites (Supplementary Table S1) in the 1,000
bp promoter region upstream of TSS (Supplementary Fig. S10A).
ChIP assays revealed the association of b-arrestin-1 and E2F1 on
these promoters, along with dissociation of Rb upon nAChR
stimulation (Supplementary Fig. S10B). Transient transfection
assays demonstrated that these promoters are indeed E2F1
responsive (Supplementary Fig. S10C).
Role of b-arrestin-1 in lung cancer metastasis
Given the above results, we examined whether b-arrestin-1 was
necessary for nicotine-mediated growth and metastasis of tumors
in mice. Shb-arrestin1 cells showed markedly reduced ability to
form tumors compared with shcontrol cells when implanted
subcutaneously into athymic nude mice (Fig. 6A). The potential

system. Mice implanted with shcontrol-luc cells that received
nicotine had signiﬁcantly larger tumors compared with those
who received vehicle (Fig. 6B and E); shcontrol-luc tumors displayed metastases to brain, adrenal glands, and liver (Fig. 6D) and
nicotine treatment further enhanced metastases. Mice implanted
with shbarr1-luc had signiﬁcantly smaller tumors and nicotine
treatment did not increase tumor growth or metastasis; ex vivo
imaging of organs at the termination of the experiment conﬁrmed
these results (Fig. 6C).
Vimentin and ﬁbronectin expression was signiﬁcantly higher in
tumors from nicotine-treated mice compared with vehicle-treated
mice implanted with shcontrol cells; tumors from mice implanted
with shb-arrestin-1 cells displayed minimal staining for vimentin
and ﬁbronectin (Fig. 6F). The levels of b-arrestin-1 depletion in
the stable b-arrestin-1 knockdown cells are shown in Fig. 6G.
Taken together, these results conﬁrm that b-arrestin-1 is indispensable for the growth and metastasis of lung tumors, especially
in the context of nicotine exposure.
b-Arrestin-1 expression levels correlate with ﬁbronectin and
vimentin levels in lung tumor tissues from patients
We next examined whether the expression of b-arrestin-1 in
human lung tumor samples correlates with levels of vimentin and
ﬁbronectin by conducting qRT-PCR on 116 patient samples. As
shown in Fig. 7A and B and Supplementary Table S3, b-arrestin-1
expression showed a very strong positive correlation with vimentin (r ¼ 0.59, P < 0.0001) and ﬁbronectin (r ¼ 0.52; P < 0.0001),

which are known to be overexpressed in more aggressive tumors
(29, 30). No signiﬁcant association was observed between these
gene expression patterns and pathologic stages or smoking history
(pack years) and disease-free survival (data not shown), suggesting that b-arrestin-1 might be contributing to the growth and
metastasis of lung cancer in both smokers and nonsmokers.
ChIP assays were conducted to examine whether b-arrestin-1 is
recruited to the promoters of vimentin, ﬁbronectin, ZEB1, and
ZEB2 in human lung tumors. There was enhanced association of
E2F1 and b-arrestin-1 and elevated levels of acetylated histone H3
on vimentin, ﬁbronectin, ZEB1, and ZEB2 promoters in tumors
compared with normal lung tissues in three sets of tumor samples
(Fig. 7C–E). Taken together, these results indicate that b-arrestin-1
might have contributed to the growth and progression of NSCLCs
by regulating the expression of E2F-regulated mesenchymal genes
and EMT transcription factors.

Discussion
b-arrestins function as scaffold proteins that recruit a broad
spectrum of signaling molecules to membrane-bound receptors
(11, 31). In addition to their established roles in promoting
internalization and desensitization of GPCRs, recent studies have
implicated involvement of b-arrestins in Notch, frizzled, Wnt/
b-catenin, nAChR signaling and regulation of gene expression by
facilitating histone acetylation (32, 33). Accumulating evidences
indicate a functional role for b-arrestin-1 as a mediator of cellular

b-Arrestin-1–Mediated Induction of EMT

migration, invasion, and metastatic progression of colorectal,
ovarian, and breast cancer (34–39). In this study, we demonstrate
that b-arrestin-1, but not b-arrestin-2, plays a major role in
nicotine-induced EMT and metastasis, thus contributing to invasive properties of nicotine. The elevated levels of b-arrestin-1,
vimentin, and FN in tumors from both smokers and nonsmokers
demonstrate that the molecules contribute to the growth
and progression of NSCLCs; at the same time, the induction of
these genes could be an important mechanism by which nicotine
exerts its tumor-promoting functions. Interestingly, b-arrestin-1
was necessary for the induction of mesenchymal promoters upon
nAChR stimulation, it did not play a role in TGFb-mediated
induction of these genes. The induction of these genes by
b-arrestin-1 and E2F1 in response to nAChR signaling required
Src activity; at the same time, TGFb induces these mesenchymal
genes through SMAD proteins, suggesting a unique role for
b-arrestin-1 in mediating signals downstream of nAChRs (40, 41).
In addition, the present study demonstrates the critical role of
E2F1 in regulating genes involved in EMT, including ZEB1 and
ZEB2. ZEB1 suppresses the expression of basement membrane
components, cell polarity factors, and epithelial genes, including
E-cadherin (42–44), promoting tumor invasion and metastasis
(45, 46). ZEB2 collaborates with the TGFb signaling pathway by
interacting with SMAD factors, and induces tumor cell invasion
(47). A recent analysis of gene expression database of NSCLC cell
lines identiﬁed a mesenchymal gene pattern (low E-cadherin,
high vimentin) signiﬁcantly associated with ZEB1 and ZEB2
expression but not with snail, slug, twist1, or twist2 (48). However, correlations between these genes with proliferative signaling
cascades have not been elucidated. Our studies show that mitogenic signaling through the nAChRs can also activate components
of invasive and metastatic phenotype of cancer.
The Rb–E2F transcriptional regulatory pathway plays a major
role in cell-cycle regulation, but its role in other aspects of tumor
progression, invasion, and metastasis is relatively less explored.
E2F1 has been shown to induce VEGF receptors and MMPs,
indicating the importance of the Rb–E2F pathway in promoting
tumor angiogenesis and metastasis (23, 24). Recent studies demonstrated that Rb depletion results in disruption of cell–cell
adhesion and downregulation of E-cadherin (49). In addition,

other EMT-related transcription factors, including slug and ZEB1,
are also induced by Rb depletion, suggesting that inhibition of
EMT is a novel tumor-suppressor function of Rb (50). Our ﬁnding
that the Rb–E2F pathway is involved in the regulation of mesenchymal proteins and EMT-related transcription factors provides
a molecular mechanism by which Rb and E2F1 facilitate tumor
progression. This also raises the possibility that signaling events
that inactivate Rb and promote cell proliferation might also
promote EMT and metastasis upon the acquisition of additional
mutational events or signaling cues, suggesting an interrelated
circuitry of signaling and transcriptional events that promote the
initiation as well as progression of cancers.
