BACKGROUND: New, effective chemotherapeutic agents are needed for intraocular retinoblastoma. METHODS: This institutional clinical trial sought to estimate the rate of response to 2 courses of vincristine and topotecan (VT) window therapy in patients with bilateral retinoblastoma and advanced disease (Reese-Ellsworth group IV or V) in at least 1 eye. The topotecan dose started at 3 mg/m2/
day for 5 days and was adjusted to target a systemic exposure of 140  20 ng/mL  hour. The vincristine dose was 0.05 mg/kg for
patients <12 months of age and 1.5 mg/m2 for those >12 months of age at diagnosis. RESULTS: From February 2005 to June 2010, 27
patients received VT window therapy. Median age at enrollment was 8.1 months (range, 0.7-22.1 months). Twenty-four patients
(88.9%) responded to window therapy (95% confidence interval ¼ 71.3%-96.9%). Hematologic toxicity comprised grade 4 neutropenia
(n ¼ 27), grade 3 anemia (n ¼ 19), and grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia (n ¼ 16). Thirteen patients had grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity.
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support was added after 10 patients had been treated, and it significantly reduced the duration
of grade 4 neutropenia (median, 7 vs 24 days; P < .001). Pharmacokinetic studies showed rapid changes in topotecan clearance rates
during the first year of life. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of topotecan and vincristine is effective for the treatment of advanced
intraocular retinoblastoma. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor treatment alleviates the duration of grade 4 neutropenia. AppropriC 2012

Primary systemic chemotherapy moved to the forefront of the management of intraocular retinoblastoma in the 1990s.1-3
Its aims were to reduce tumor volume and allow focal consolidation therapy while avoiding external-beam irradiation of
young patients with a germline RB1 (retinoblastoma 1) mutation that increases the risk of second tumors throughout life.4
Initial primary chemotherapy comprised carboplatin, vincristine, and etoposide with or without cyclosporine.1-3,5
To reduce the risk of chemotherapy-induced acute myeloid leukemia,6 the previous prospective study RET3
(Carboplatin Plus Vincristine in Treating Children With Retinoblastoma),7 conducted at St. Jude Children’s Research
Hospital, Memphis, Tenn, excluded etoposide and called for 8 cycles of carboplatin and vincristine at 3-week intervals.
Focal therapy was withheld until disease progression was noted. Although the results were similar to those obtained with
the 3-drug regimens, further improvement was needed; we reasoned that better outcomes would require the earlier
introduction of focal therapy or the use of new effective chemotherapeutic agents.
Topotecan was subsequently selected for investigation in a phase 2 study conducted at St. Jude Children’s Research
Hospital. Topotecan had been shown to provide good cerebrospinal fluid penetration in children with central nervous

system tumors8 and a 25% to 30% response rate in
patients with high-risk medulloblastoma.9 Other pediatric malignancies, including neuroblastoma10 and rhabdomyosarcoma,11 were also responsive to topotecan.
Further, topotecan had shown efficacy against retinoblastoma in both preclinical12 and clinical13 studies. The
blood–ocular barrier is similar to the blood–brain barrier,
and preclinical studies at St. Jude Children’s Research
Hospital had shown that topotecan readily penetrates the
vitreous humor.12 Finally, therapeutic response in children with embryonal brain tumors was related to topotecan cerebrospinal fluid penetration achievable only after
high topotecan plasma exposure (eg, area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] of 140 ng/mLhour), which
is only tolerable on a schedule of daily doses for 5 days/
week.9
Metabolism and elimination of drugs is unique during the first few months of life,14 and bilateral retinoblastoma occurs at a much younger age than other childhood
malignancies. Therefore, it was important to perform a
prospective phase 2 study to evaluate response and toxicity
in this age group. Here, we describe the responses and
toxicity profile associated with 2 courses of vincristine and
topotecan window therapy in children with advanced
intraocular retinoblastoma.

The primary objective of the RET5 trial was to estimate the response rate of stratum B patients to 2 courses
of window therapy with vincristine and topotecan (VT).
Topotecan (a 0.5-hour daily infusion for 5 days) was first
administered at 3 mg/m2/day, and the dose was then
adjusted to attain a targeted systemic exposure of 140 
20 ng/mL  hour. The vincristine dose was 0.05 mg/kg for
patients age <12 months and 1.5 mg/m2 for patients age
12 months at diagnosis.
To accurately evaluate response to the window VT
therapy, focal consolidation was used only after the second course of chemotherapy. Patients who had a complete response or partial response (PR) to window
therapy were to receive 3 additional courses of VT at
21-day intervals (courses 5, 8, and 11), alternating with
vincristine–carboplatin (courses 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 10).
Subsequent courses of chemotherapy were initiated only
if absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was >750/lL and
platelet count was >100,000/lL. Patients with less than
a PR after window therapy were to receive 6 courses of
vincristine, carboplatin, and etoposide, given at 21-day
intervals. After hematologic toxicity was observed in the
first 10 patients, the protocol was amended to add granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (5 lg/kg/
day), starting at 24 to 36 hours after completion of
each course of chemotherapy and given for 7 to 10
days, until ANC was >2000/lL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Treatment Plan

The RET5 protocol (www.clinicaltrials.org identifier
NCT0018688) was opened to accrual on February 4,
2005, after approval by the St. Jude Institutional Review
Board. Written, informed consent was obtained from the
parent or guardian of each patient.
Patients with nonmetastatic intraocular retinoblastoma were stratified according to disease laterality and
stage. Eyes were grouped by the Reese-Ellsworth group as
the study design progressed between 2002 and 2004 and
was approved in 2005. During this period, the newly
designed classification (International Classification of
Retinoblastoma)15 that provided better evaluation of
response to intravenous chemotherapy was still being evaluated. Stratum A was for early-group bilateral or unilateral (unifocal or multifocal) retinoblastoma (ReeseEllsworth groups I to III). Stratum B was for bilateral retinoblastoma for which conservative management was considered and in which at least 1 eye had Reese-Ellsworth
group IV or V disease. Stratum C was for advanced
(Reese-Ellsworth group IV or V) unilateral retinoblastoma that required enucleation.

Definition of Response

Patients underwent serial, detailed funduscopic examinations under anesthesia. All tumors were carefully documented during each exam by using the RET-CAM II
retinal camera (Clarity Medical, Pleasanton, Calif), which
provided digital storage and allowed immediate comparison to previous findings. Patients on stratum B also
underwent serial magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits
and Doppler ultrasonography of the eye as an adjunct
means of measuring tumors and evaluating responses. A
complete response was defined as complete calcification
or regression of all documented tumors for at least 4
weeks, and a PR was defined as >50% but <100% reduction or calcification of the tumors, without the appearance
of new lesions, for at least 4 weeks. Development of any
new lesion (including vitreous seeds), irrespective of other
responses, constituted progressive disease. Response was
documented per eye and per patient. For analysis of the
primary objective (the response rate of stratum B patients
to 2 courses of window therapy), response was assessed
per patient, using the lesser response of the 2 eyes.

Statistical Design and Analysis

Pharmacokinetically Guided Topotecan Dosing

The RET5 protocol was a single-arm, 2-stage study
designed to evaluate response to window therapy by using
the sequential conditional probability ratio test16 to determine whether the response rate was 70% versus 85%
with a 10% significance level and 90% power. The
planned sample size was 53 patients, and an interim analysis was planned after 27 stratum B patients had been evaluated for response. If 18 or fewer of the 27 patients had
responses, closure of the study would be considered.
Although RET5 was predicted to reach its full recruitment
goal within 5 years, only 27 stratum B patients had been
enrolled after 5 years. The protocol was closed in June
2010. A Blyth-Still-Casella 95% confidence interval for
the rate of response to window therapy was calculated.
The 2-sided exact Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to
compare the duration of grade 4 neutropenia in patients
who did versus those who did not receive G-CSF with
window therapy. An alpha value of P ¼ .05 was prospectively chosen.

We used a previously described pharmacokinetically
guided dosing approach18 to individualize topotecan dosage to attain a targeted plasma AUC of 120 to 160 ng/mL
 hour. After the first topotecan dose of course 1, plasma
samples were obtained, processed immediately, and analyzed. If the topotecan plasma AUC was within the target
range, no adjustment was required. If not, the dosage was
adjusted linearly on the basis of the patient’s topotecan
clearance rate (CL) to attain the targeted AUC on day 2,
and repeat pharmacokinetic studies were performed.
Pharmacokinetic data from samples obtained on day 5 of
course 1 were used to determine the starting dosage for
the second course of therapy. During the second course,
plasma samples were collected on day 1, and the dosage
was adjusted as described for course 1. If dose adjustments
were required during course 2, pharmacokinetic studies
were repeated during course 5 (the third course of VT),
beginning with dose 1. Pharmacokinetic targeting studies
were similarly performed with dose 1 of course 8 (the
fourth course of VT).

Pharmacokinetic Sampling and Analysis

Plasma samples were obtained according to a limited sampling model,17 before topotecan infusion and at hours
0.083, 1.5, and 2.5 after the end of infusion. At each time
point, 2 mL of whole blood was collected from a site contralateral to the infusion and placed in a heparinized tube.
Plasma was separated for assay of topotecan lactone
concentration.18
To support pharmacokinetically guided topotecan
dosing, the AUC (topotecan systemic exposure) from
time zero to infinity (AUC0!1) was estimated by fitting
a 2-compartment model to topotecan lactone plasma concentration–time data by using a maximum a posteriori
Bayesian algorithm in ADAPT 5 software.18 To calculate
age-based optimal topotecan starting dosages for future
studies, all pharmacokinetic data were combined to develop a nonlinear mixed-effects model using NONMEM
7 software. Estimated fixed-effect parameters included
volumes of the central (Vc) and peripheral (Vd) compartments, clearance rate (CL), and intercompartmental
clearance rate (Q). Interindividual variability of all fixedeffects parameters and interoccasion variability of CL
were estimated. The PRIOR subroutine in NONMEM
was used to include previously estimated data from older
patients. Age was tested as a covariate of CL by using a sigmoidal function, where age was adjusted to the estimated
postconceptual age. Monte Carlo simulations were performed with the final model to assess the optimal starting
dosages for different age groups.

RESULTS
Patients

Table 1 shows the characteristics of the 27 stratum B
patients. All had bilateral disease and at least 1 eye in
Reese-Ellsworth group IV or V. Median age at study
enrollment was 8.1 months. Seven patients (26%) were
<6 months of age, and 23 (85%) were <12 months of
age at diagnosis. Most patients were caucasian (78%).
Fifteen patients (56%) had advanced-stage (group IV or
V) disease in both eyes. Two patients (7%), neither of
whom received G-CSF, had 13q deletions.
Response

Of the 27 patients, 23 had confirmed, sustained PR in
both eyes and were considered to have an overall PR; 1
patient had undergone enucleation of the left eye at diagnosis and had a PR in the right eye that was sustained for
8 weeks. Thus, 24 of 27 patients (88.9%) responded to
VT (95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 71.3%-96.9%).
One patient who experienced unacceptable toxicity discontinued window therapy and was categorized as a nonresponder. Each of 2 patients had a PR in 1 eye but
developed new lesions in the other eye within 4 weeks;
they were therefore categorized as having progressive disease. Of the 53 eyes available for response evaluation, 49
(92.4%) had a PR to window therapy. The Reese-Ellsworth distribution of the 49 eyes comprised group II (n ¼
3), group III (n ¼ 8), group IV (n ¼ 17), and group V

partial calcification.
Courses and Dose Modifications

Twenty-six of the 27 stratum B patients received both
courses of window therapy. The patient who did not complete both courses had a 13q deletion and did not receive
G-CSF. After experiencing 21 days of grade 4 neutropenia
during course 1, grade 4 thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, and grade 2 colitis and allergic reaction (drug fever),
this patient was moved to a nonprotocol vincristine–carboplatin regimen. The 26 patients who received both
courses required a median of 47 days (range, 41-55 days)
to complete window therapy (calculated from the start of
window course 1 to the day before course 3 began). The
median time required to complete window therapy was
49 days (range, 42-55 days) in the 9 patients treated without G-CSF and 44 days (range, 41-51 days) in the 17
patients who received G-CSF (P ¼ .095). Five patients
required a delay of VT during course 2; 3 of the 5 did not
receive G-CSF (delays of 5, 7, and 6 days); the 2 who
received G-CSF had delays of 1 and 5 days.
Toxicity

Version 3.0 of the Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events was used to evaluate toxicity in our study.
5666

Myelosuppression was significant. All patients experienced grade 4 hematologic toxicity (neutropenia) during
window therapy (Table 2). Nineteen of the 27 patients
(70%) had grade 3 anemia, and 16 patients (59%) had
grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia. Thirteen patients (48%)
experienced grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity (Table
2), including 6 of 10 patients (60%) treated without
G-CSF and 7 of 17 patients (41%) who received G-CSF
(P ¼ .44).
The median duration of grade 4 neutropenia was 24
days (range, 10-33 days) for patients treated without
G-CSF and 7 days (range, 4-11 days) for those treated
with G-CSF (P < .0001). Five patients had grade 3 febrile
neutropenia during window therapy, including 3 of 10
patients (30%) treated without G-CSF and 2 of 17
patients (12%) treated with G-CSF (P ¼ .33). The febrile
neutropenia resolved within 1 day in all patients but one;
that patient was treated without G-CSF and had grade 3
febrile neutropenia for 11 days.
Twenty of the 27 patients (74%) required packed
red blood cell transfusions during window therapy; 13
patients (48%) required 1 transfusion and 7 (26%)
required 2. Eight of 10 patients (80%) treated without GCSF and 12 of 17 patients (71%) who received G-CSF
required packed red blood cell transfusions. Seven of the
27 patients (26%) required platelet transfusion during
window therapy, including 3 of 10 patients (30%) treated
without G-CSF and 4 of 17 patients (24%) treated with
G-CSF. Six patients received 1 platelet transfusion and 1
received 2 platelet transfusions.
Pharmacokinetic Analysis

A total of 111 pharmacokinetic studies were performed in
26 patients. After the first (fixed) dose of cycle 1, 8 of 26
patients (31%) were within the targeted exposure range.
The median topotecan lactone clearance rate after this
dose was 18.8 L/hour/m2 (range, 9.8-36.8 L/hour/m2).
Of the remaining 85 pharmacokinetic studies, 54 (64%)
revealed systemic exposure within the target range. The
topotecan lactone clearance rate was observed to increase
rapidly with age, particularly in very young children.
Only 3 patients required no topotecan dose modification.
A nonlinear mixed-effects modeling and simulation
analysis was performed to relate topotecan clearance to
age and determine age-appropriate starting dosages. Systemic clearance of topotecan lactone changed rapidly during the first year of life (Fig. 1). The effect of age on
clearance was appropriately described by a sigmoidal relationship. Monte Carlo simulations based on the final
model, including the effect of age on clearance, were used

(Table 3).
DISCUSSION
Although our study demonstrated that the combination
of topotecan and vincristine is an effective therapy of previously untreated advanced intraocular retinoblastoma,
we believe that most of the observed response is due to
topotecan. Our group demonstrated previously that
vincristine had the lowest effect on retinoblastoma cell
cultures and no effect on retinoblastoma in preclinical
mouse models.12 Carboplatin and etoposide have been
the mainstay of chemotherapy for intraocular retinoblastoma for 2 decades.1-3,5,7 However, these agents pose a
long-term risk of second malignancy1,6 and ototoxicity,19,20 and patients with advanced intraocular retinoblastoma remain at high risk of requiring external-beam
irradiation or enucleation. Chantada et al used topotecan
in 9 patients but with metastatic (n ¼ 6) or relapsed/refractory (n ¼ 3) previously treated intraocular retinoblasCancer

reported in prospective studies of other therapeutic agents
in untreated patients.1,5
We also describe the toxicity profile of topotecan in
the youngest group reported to date. Only a few studies11,21,22 have used the regimen of daily doses over 5 days,
which we chose because a higher topotecan systemic exposure (AUC of 140 ng/mL  hour) was tolerated in patients
with central nervous system tumors.9 Comparison of toxicity data across studies is confounded not only by different
intravenous topotecan regimens23 but also by differences in
age, previous treatment, dosing, use of G-CSF, and methods of reporting toxicity (that is, per course vs per patient)
(Table 4). In addition, there are intrastudy differences in
topotecan doses and/or use of G-CSF. Overall, our toxicity
profile was comparable to those reported with the use of
similar regimens, and VT therapy was well tolerated after
G-CSF was introduced. Patients treated with G-CSF had a

significantly shorter duration of grade 4 neutropenia, a
lower frequency of grade 3/4 nonhematologic toxicity, and
less delay in completing window therapy.
Our use of pharmacokinetically guided topotecan
dosage was initially intended to minimize interpatient variability in topotecan systemic exposure and to target a
range of plasma drug exposure putatively associated with
cytotoxic effects in the vitreous body and retina. The rapid
change in topotecan lactone clearance rates observed during the first year of life partially explained the limited success of pharmacokinetically guided dose adjustment.
However, pharmacokinetically guided dosing prevented
the recurrence of systemic overexposure to topotecan
observed after the first dose, especially in very young children. This finding presumably reflects a lower topotecan
systemic clearance in young children with developing renal function (the primary mechanism of topotecan elimination). Age <0.5 versus >0.5 years was previously
shown to be a significant covariate in a pharmacokinetic
study of a topotecan-treated population.24 However, only
a few infants <0.5 years of age were included. The present
study greatly enhances our ability to accurately select
appropriate doses for these children. We acknowledge
that pharmacokinetically guided dosing requires extensive
infrastructure and may be available at only a few centers.25
However, in its absence, the information in Table 4 may
be used to select both the initial dosage and appropriate
increases in dosage as an infant ages. These starting doses
will be used in our future protocols and our standard of
care for topotecan therapy in infants <1 year of age.
Another potential limitation to wider acceptance of
our regimen is the higher toxicity observed compared with
other standard therapies for intraocular retinoblastoma.1-3,5
We believe that if our approach demonstrates a higher success rate in avoiding enucleation and/or radiation therapy,
such extra toxicity could be justified. In addition, different
strategies such as use of topotecan without vincristine or
fewer cycles of topotecan could be investigated in the
future. Such approaches could decrease toxicity, especially
nonhematologic, without compromising efficacy.
Childhood cancers during the first year of life are
unique and are increasingly diagnosed.26 The physiology
of infants is unique as well, compounding the complexity
of treatment. Our comprehensive toxicity and pharmacokinetic data may be useful in treating many cancers in this
age group.
