BACKGROUND. The incidence of primary central nervous system lymphoma
(PCNSL) has increased in recent decades and is highest in people aged 65
years. Radiotherapy (XRT) and systemic chemotherapy (CTX), alone or in combination, are reported to extend survival, but treatment-related toxicity is a particular concern in the elderly. The objective of the current study was to identify
factors associated with the receipt and type of treatment in a population-based
cohort of older PCNSL patients.

METHODS. Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry data linked with Medicare claims, the authors identified PCNSL cases in
adults aged 65 years who were diagnosed between 1994 and 2002. Initial treatment was defined as XRT alone, CTX alone, combined CTX and XRT, or no treatment, based on Medicare claims in the 6 months after diagnosis. The authors
assessed the effects of age, comorbidity, and sociodemographic characteristics on
the odds of receiving treatment.
RESULTS. Of 579 PCNSL patients, 464 (80%) received any treatment. XRT alone
was the most common modality (46%), followed by combined therapy (33%)
and CTX alone (22%). The type of treatment varied by age (P < .0001). The use
of CTX alone or in combination with XRT decreased with increasing age,

whereas the use of XRT alone increased with age. In adjusted analysis, younger
age (P < .01) was found to be predictive of the receipt of any treatment. The use
of CTX decreased with age (P < .0001). The median survival was 7 months (95%
confidence interval, 6–8 months); no significant time trends were observed.
CONCLUSIONS. Although the majority of older PCNSL patients received treatment,
most did not receive optimal therapy. Age was found to have the greatest influence on treatment selection. Overall survival in elderly PCNSL patients appears
to be poor. Cancer 2007;110:1338–44.  2007 American Cancer Society.

P

rimary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare
form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that is restricted to the
brain, cerebrospinal fluid, or eyes. The age-adjusted incidence of
PCNSL in the U.S. has increased substantially since the 1970s.1
Although much of this increase has been attributed to the spread of
the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (HIV/AIDS), its incidence among the elderly immunocompetent population also has increased.2–4
Recent reports suggest that chemotherapy (CTX) alone or in
combination with radiotherapy (XRT) improves survival more than
the use of XRT alone.5,6 Despite important treatment advances, our
prior analysis of a population-based cohort did not identify signifi-

cant improvements in survival from PCNSL from
1975 through 1999.7 Even after excluding individuals
known to have HIV/AIDS, the median survival from
the time of PCNSL diagnosis was 9 months, and
this estimate did not appear to vary by year of
diagnosis. These results suggest that therapeutic
advances may not be widely disseminated among
community practitioners or may not be as effective
in routine clinical practice as they have been in
prospective trials.
Clinicians may be reluctant to offer aggressive
therapies to older patients with PCNSL. There is a
common perception that high-dose methotrexate is
too toxic to administer safely to older patients, many
of whom may be offered treatment with XRT alone
in spite of data suggesting its inferior efficacy.
Furthermore, the elderly patient population is relatively understudied and often under-represented in
clinical trials for brain tumors.8,9 As a result, it is difficult to know which treatments are being offered to
older patients and which factors influence therapeutic decision-making. Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)–Medicare-linked
database, we assessed patterns of treatment in
PCNSL patients aged 65 years in a large population-based cohort.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data
We identified a cohort of PCNSL patients from SEER
cancer registry data that were linked with Medicare
claims. SEER, sponsored by the National Cancer
Institute, is a consortium of population-based cancer
registries in selected states and metropolitan areas
covering >20% of the U.S. population. For all incident cancers in their coverage areas, the SEER registries collect data regarding the site and extent of
disease, surgery and XRT planned or administered
within 4 months of diagnosis, and sociodemographic
characteristics with active follow-up for date and
cause of death. The SEER registries maintain high
standards of data quality, and the program’s overall
completeness of case ascertainment is 98%.10
For cancer patients aged 65 years residing in
SEER areas, Medicare claims have been linked with
SEER files. Medicare is the primary health insurer for
97% of Americans aged 65 years, covering inpatient
hospital care (Part A), outpatient and physician services (Part B), and other medical care. Among persons aged 65 years in the SEER database, at least
93% have been identified in the Medicare enrollment
file.10 We used Medicare claims from 3 sources: 1)
the physician/supplier file, which contains claims for

1339

physician and other professional services; 2) the outpatient standard analytic file, which contains claims
for outpatient facility services; and 3) the Medicare
provider analysis and review file, which contains
claims for hospital inpatient services.

Study Cohort
From the 2006 release of the linked SEER-Medicare
database, we identified all subjects aged 65 years
with a primary diagnosis of PCNSL made between
1994 and 2002. PCNSL cases were identified in SEER
as cancers in the primary anatomic sites of the brain,
spinal cord, cranial nerves, and other parts of the
central nervous system (CNS) (International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 2nd edition [ICD-O2] codes C70.0–C72.9), with specified NHL morphologies (ICD-O-2 codes 9590–9595, 9670–9698, 9711,
and 9714). Patients whose diagnoses were made only
at the time of death, those who were enrolled in a
health maintenance organization (HMO) at the time
of diagnosis, and those who lacked Medicare Part B
coverage were excluded.
Because immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients with PCNSL differ with regard to
their therapeutic options and overall survival, we
attempted to isolate an immunocompetent cohort.
Using a method employed in a prior study of PCNSL
survival, we distinguished HIV/AIDS-related PCNSL
cases on the basis of cause of death.7 Deaths due to
HIV/AIDS were identified by the ICD underlying
cause-of-death code listed on the state death certificate (ICD-8 or ICD-9 codes 42.0–44.9 and ICD-10
codes B20.0–B24.0). Patients who died of causes
other than HIV/AIDS and those who were alive at
the time of last follow-up were assumed to have
PCNSL unrelated to HIV/AIDS.
Treatment
The use of CTX and XRT was identified on the basis
of inpatient, outpatient, and physician claims in
the first 6 months after the diagnosis of PCNSL.
Treatment was identified by ICD-9 Clinical Modification diagnosis and procedure codes and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes
(Table 1).
Initial treatment was categorized as XRT alone,
CTX alone, combined CTX and XRT, or no treatment.
For patients identified as having received both CTX
and XRT within the first 6 months after diagnosis, we
also determined the sequence of treatment modalities. If the first CTX (or XRT) treatment was administered >7 days after the first XRT (CTX) treatment,
we described the treatment combination as sequen-

tial. If the 2 treatment modalities were initiated
within 7 days of each other, the treatments were
then considered concurrent.

Explanatory Variables
We assessed the impact of demographic, socioeconomic, disease, and general health characteristics on
the receipt and type of treatment. Demographic
characteristics, from SEER and Medicare records,
included age at diagnosis, gender, race (white vs
other/unknown), marital status (married vs not married/unknown), number of prior cancers, and urban
versus rural residence (metropolitan vs nonmetropolitan county). Socioeconomic status (SES) was evaluated using an area-level measure of SES: the
percentage of the population living at or below the
federal poverty level in census tract of residence
(<10% vs 10%). Comorbidity was assessed using
the Romano modification of the Charlson comorbidity index based on inpatient Medicare claims in the
12 months prior to diagnosis.11,12 A minority of
patients in the sample (14.7%) had been enrolled in
Medicare for <12 months at the time they were diagnosed with PCNSL.
Outcomes
The primary outcome of the analysis was the type of
therapy (including no treatment) received in the first
6 months after diagnosis. We identified predictors of
treatment using multivariate logistic regression. To
assess time trends, we classified year of diagnosis in
3-year intervals. We also assessed overall survival
using Kaplan-Meier estimation methods. Survival
was calculated as the time from diagnosis to death
or last follow-up. Observations were censored in

cases in which a patient was alive at the time of last
follow-up. Survival distributions were compared
using the log-rank test. All analyses were performed
using SAS statistical software (SAS Institute Inc, Cary,
NC).

RESULTS
Between 1994 and 2002, 1383 patients were diagnosed with PCNSL in the linked SEER-Medicare database. Of these patients, 809 were aged 65 years.
Patients were excluded if they had 1 of the following: diagnosed at death or autopsy (14 patients), enrolled in an HMO at the time of diagnosis (170
patients), not registered in Parts A and B of Medicare
at the time of diagnosis (50 patients), or had no
available information regarding the month of diagnosis (3 patients). To identify an immunocompetent
cohort, patients who died of an HIV/AIDS-related illness (3 patients) also were excluded. The final cohort
included 579 patients.
As shown in Table 2, XRT alone was the most
common treatment modality (36%), followed by
combined therapy (26%) and CTX alone (17%). There
were 115 patients (20%) who received no treatment.
The type of treatment varied considerably by age
(P < .0001), with younger patients being more likely
to receive any treatment. Of those patients ages 65
to 69 years, 85% received any treatment, whereas
only 66% of those aged 85 years received any treatment. Age also appeared to influence the type of
treatment among those patients who received any
therapy. The receipt of CTX, either alone or in combination with XRT, decreased with increasing age. Of
the 115 patients ages 65 to 69 years who received
any treatment, 81 (70%) received CTX. In comparison, of the 90 patients aged 80 years who received
any treatment, only 31 (34%) received CTX. Of the
152 patients who received both XRT and CTX, 28
(18%) received concurrent treatment, 65 (43%)
received treatment with XRT prior to CTX, and 59
(39%) were treated with CTX prior to XRT (data not
shown).
No important differences with regard to treatment patterns were observed by gender, urban versus
rural residence, or number of prior cancers. There
were slight differences noted by race, with nonwhite
patients more likely to receive XRT alone and less
likely to receive any CTX compared with white
patients. Patients with more comorbid illness were
less like to receive any treatment and also were less
likely to receive combined therapy. Married patients
were more likely to receive combined therapy than
unmarried patients.

PCNSL indicates primary central nervous system lymphoma.

On multivariate analysis, the receipt of any
treatment decreased with increasing age (P < .01)
and comorbidity (P 5 .08) (Table 3). Among patients
who received any treatment (Table 4), the use of
CTX decreased with increasing age (P < .0001) and
was more common in those who were white (P 5
.08). Comorbidity was not found to be a significant
predictor of the receipt of CTX.

To identify time trends, we grouped year of diagnosis into 3-year intervals (1994–1996, 1997–1999,
and 2000–2002). Across all 3 treatment periods,
approximately 20% of patients were untreated. Differences were observed over time in the treatments
that involved CTX. Only 8% of patients diagnosed
between 1994 and 1996 received CTX alone, whereas
25% of those diagnosed between 2000 and 2002

received CTX alone. There was a decline over time in
the use of combination treatment (XRT and CTX). In
all 3 time periods, XRT alone was the most common
treatment.
For the entire cohort, the median overall survival
was 7 months (95% confidence interval, 6–8 months)
(Fig. 1). There were 93 patients alive at the time of
last follow-up, with a median follow-up of 26
months; the median age at the time of diagnosis of
these surviving patients was 72 years (range, 65–88
years) and only 8% of patients had any comorbidity.
Of the surviving patients, 91 had documentation of
treatment and 74% received CTX either alone (34%)
or in combination with XRT (40%). There were 381
deaths attributed to PCNSL (ie, NHL or a malignancy
of the brain or CNS) and 97 deaths due to other
causes, including diseases of the heart (28 patients),
pneumonia and influenza (3 patients), cerebrovascular diseases (10 patients), and various other specified
causes (19 patients). Deaths due to other cancers

included in situ, benign, or neoplasms of unknown
behavior (17 patients); lung cancer (4 patients); miscellaneous malignant cancer (3 patients); colon cancer (2 patients); bladder cancer (1 patient); breast
cancer (1 patient); and pancreatic cancer (1 patient).
The cause of death was not available for 8 patients.
As shown in Figure 2, the survival distributions did
not vary by year of diagnosis.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, there currently is no universally
accepted standard treatment for PCNSL. However,
expert recommendations and available data endorse
the use of methotrexate-based CTX alone or in combination with whole brain XRT. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines
suggest avoiding XRT in patients aged 60 years
whenever possible.13 Unfortunately, this analysis suggests that the majority of elderly PCNSL patients are

offered treatment with XRT alone and that the median survival is poor and similar to that observed in
the 1980s.
XRT alone was found to be the most common
treatment approach across all time intervals and all
age subgroups, with the exception of patients ages
65 to 69 years, who were more commonly treated
with a combination of CTX and XRT. The fact that
greater than half of elderly patients were not treated
or received XRT alone may account for the observed
low survival rates. These survival rates are comparable to the results of Radiation Therapy Oncology
Group (RTOG) Trial 83-15, which demonstrated that
patients aged >60 years have a median survival of
7.6 months when treated with XRT alone.14
The major trend we observed in the treatment of
elderly PCNSL patients was the decreased use of CTX
plus XRT and a concomitant increase in the use of
CTX alone. This likely reflects a change in medical
oncology practice during the 1990s, specifically the
increased recognition of the risk of neurotoxicity
associated with combined modality therapy, particularly in older patients. However, during this same
time period, the use of XRT alone remained stable. It
is possible that this reflects a referral pattern directly
to radiation oncology that we were unable to examine more specifically in the current study.
The recommended sequence of combined modality therapy is to administer CTX prior to XRT.15,16
However, in this dataset, only 39% of patients who
received combined therapy had their treatment
administered in this sequence, whereas 61% either
received concurrent therapy or XRT followed by CTX.

Modality sequence may affect the risk of neurotoxicity, which primarily occurs with the combined
impact of methotrexate and XRT. This risk may be
increased if methotrexate is administered concomitantly or after XRT.
Age was found to be the most significant predictor of receipt of therapy. Increasing age was associated with a decrease in the chance of receiving any
therapy and decreased the likelihood of receiving
CTX. Although there is a common perception that elderly patients are less able than younger patients to
tolerate systemic CTX, we did not find a significant
effect of comorbidity on treatment selection. Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of treating elderly PCNSL patients using CTX.17,18
Other than age, few sociodemographic characteristics were found to be associated with treatment.
Older patients and those who were unmarried were
less likely to receive CTX. No significant variations
in therapy were observed on the basis of race or
area-level economic status. However, our sample was
relatively small, and its statistical power may have
been insufficient to detect significant associations
between these characteristics and the type of treatment received.
Because our analyses were based on administrative data, we had no available information regarding
important characteristics such as performance status,
cognitive function, social support, and detailed tumor characteristics. All these factors likely influence

treatment decisions, and performance status is a
consistent marker of prognosis.19 We also lacked information regarding physician treatment recommendations and patient preferences, which may have
differed in some cases from the treatment ultimately
received. Finally, in a majority of cases, we were
unable to identify specific chemotherapeutic agents;
the majority of the CTX use in the study cohort was
identified from inpatient claims, which do not contain agent-specific codes.
The results of the current study suggest that
many elderly patients with PCNSL do not receive
optimal care. Less than half of all patients received
any CTX as a component of treatment and many
were given combined modality therapy in a suboptimal sequence. We would recommend several possible strategies to improve the management of elderly
PCNSL patients within the community. Effective educational strategies should be developed and offered
to those practitioners most likely to see these
patients early in the course of their disease, including
neurosurgeons, geriatricians, and neurologists. Ideally, it would be best to have elderly patients with
PCNSL treated at a tertiary referral center with expertise in PCNSL management, but this appears unlikely
given geographic constraints and other practical limitations. Finally, the development of appropriate clinical trials that incorporate or specifically address the
treatment of PCNSL in elderly patients is critical,
because many recently reported studies have age
restrictions that limit their applicability to this
patient population.
