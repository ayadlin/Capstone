BACKGROUND: In 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued regulatory alerts for use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in cancer patients with anemia after clinical trials and meta-analysis data found that
high ESA doses were associated with adverse outcomes in patients. In response to these findings, specific patient
management tools for anemia (consisting in an algorithm and prescribing order set) were developed by a multidisciplinary team at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. METHODS: A retrospective study consisted of
7117 patients aged 18 years and older with cancer malignancies who had received an ESA between January 2006 and
December 2008 at MD Anderson. Changes in utilization of ESAs and packed red blood cells (PRBCs) were evaluated.
RESULTS: The number of ESA doses dispensed each month decreased by 83% from January 2006 to December
2008 (P < .01), and the number of patients who received ESAs decreased by 80% (P < .01). The number of dispensed
ESA doses for hemoglobin (Hb) levels 12 g/dL decreased significantly from 4% to 0% (P < .01), and the number for
10 g/dL decreased from 44% to 12% (P < .01). The PRBC transfusion rate remained stable in solid tumor patients (P
> .05) but increased from 7% to 9% (P < .05) in patients with hematologic malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: The authors
summarized their experience with use of ESAs in a tertiary oncology center. The implementation of their patient management tools for anemia might have facilitated the observed change at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Cancer

KEYWORDS: erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, anemia, cancer, patient management, evidence-based.

Patients with cancer often experience anemia as a result of disease or treatment.1-3 Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents
(ESAs) have been shown in multiple controlled clinical trials to increase hemoglobin (Hb) levels, reduce the need for transfusions, and improve quality of life in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia and anemia due to malignancies.4-9 Based
on these results, two ESAs epoetin alfa (epoetin) and darbepoetin alfa (darbepoetin) have been approved by the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia.6 In 1998, data began to emerge associating excessive target hemoglobin (Hb) levels with an increased risk of thrombosis and mortality, warranting ESA labeling changes
for patients with chronic renal failure and concurrent cardiac disease.10 In 2002 on the basis of these safety concerns, the
American Society of Hematology (ASH) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) developed joint evidencebased clinical practice guidelines for use of ESAs in chemotherapy-induced anemia and in patients with anemia due to malignant diseases.11,12 The 2002 ASH/ASCO guidelines recommended 1) initiation of ESAs when Hb levels fell below 10 g/dL

and 2) that maintenance Hb levels should be kept at or
near 12 g/dL in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia.11,12 Because of insufficient data, no recommended
Hb levels were stated in these guidelines for initiation of
ESAs in patients with anemia due to malignant diseases.12,13 Subsequent evidence that had accumulated from
clinical trials published between 2002 and 2008 demonstrated increased adverse outcomes associated with ESAs,
including increased tumor progression and decreased survival of cancer patients not receiving concurrent chemotherapy when excessive Hb values were targeted.14,15 In
addition, a meta-analysis based on 6769 patients in 35 trials
showed that the relative risk of a thromboembolic event
was increased by 67% in the ESA-treated group compared
with a control group.16 The need to minimize the risks of
ESA administration to cancer patients has led to changes in
indications and expanded warnings for ESA use as
summarized in the FDA 2004 and 2008 expert panel recommendations.17,18 Similarly, the ASH/ASCO guidelines for
ESAs were updated in 2007 recommending initiation of
ESAs as Hb approaches or falls below 10 g/dL for patients
with chemotherapy-associated anemia.19 For patients with
low-risk myelodysplasia, the use of ESAs was also supported.
The lack of a survival benefit and an increased risk of
thromboembolic events were included in these guidelines.19 Concurrently, the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) also limited their coverage of ESA
administration on the basis of emerging safety concerns.20
In response to the published data on risks associated
with ESA use and to better reflect available data and
current best practices, the MD Anderson Cancer Center
revised its anemia patient care management tools to contain clear guidelines for management of chemotherapyinduced anemia, anemia due to malignant diseases, and
administration of ESAs. These tools were implemented in
September 2007, and practitioners at our institution
received education on the availability of the anemia treatment algorithm and ESA order sets.
To better understand the pattern of ESA administration during a time of changes in labeling and guidelines
and to follow the impact of changes to our patient
care management, we conducted a retrospective study to
evaluate ESA and PRBC use between 2006 and 2008 in
adult cancer patients at MD Anderson Cancer Center.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
We included all patients with cancer (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [ICD-9] codes 140-

199 for solid tumors and 200-240 for hematological
malignancies) aged 18 years or older who had received at
least 1 dose of ESA or 1 unit of packed red blood cells
(PRBCs) between January 1, 2006 and December 31,
2008 at MD Anderson. Patients’ age, sex, tumor type, Hb
values within 7 days before treatment, date and number of
ESA doses, and number PRBC units administered were
collected from our institution’s patient administrative,
laboratory, and pharmacy-dispensing databases. The
study was reviewed and approved by the MD Anderson
Institutional Review Board.
Patient Care Management Tools
Our anemia patient care management tools consist of an
algorithm and order sets. This algorithm was developed
by a multidisciplinary team on the basis of available
evidence and best practices. The algorithm for anemia
management included 1) differential management of
cancer-related anemia, 2) thresholds for treatment initiation based on laboratory values, clinical signs, and symptoms, and 3) parameters for ESA dose modification and
discontinuation. The algorithm was approved by the
appropriate committees of the medical staff. Meanwhile,
medication order sets for ESAs were revised to address
new labeling and dosing recommendations. The algorithm and order sets were made available in September
2007 to an electronic medical record system that is used
to store and retrieve patient information and to support
physicians and clinical personnel.
Outcome Measures
We measured changes in the number of ESA doses
dispensed by Hb level from 2006 to 2008. ESA treatment
was defined as at least 1 ESA dose dispensed by an
inpatient or outpatient pharmacy and recorded in the
administrative database from January 1, 2006 through
December 31, 2008. The ESA dispensed date and
quantity were linked with a known Hb level. Reasons for
ESA discontinuation and changes in Hb levels were not
evaluated in this study.
Pretreatment Hb levels were classified as <9.0,
9.0-<10.0, 10.0-<11.0, 11.0-<12.0, and 12.0 g/
dL and were recorded by using the lowest Hb level within
7 days before each ESA dose. ESA doses ranged from
10,000 units to 40,000 units for epoetin and 200 lg to
500 lg for darbepoetin. We also stratified changes by tumor
type (solid tumors and hematological malignancies).
We reviewed inpatient and outpatient PRBC transfusion orders from January 1, 2006 to December 31,

2008. The number of PRBC units ordered was stratified
according to the lowest Hb level within 7 days before
ordering PRBCs (<7.0, 7.0-<9.0, 9.0-<10.0,
10.0-<11.0, 11.0-<12.0, and 12.0 g/dL). These
data were also separated by tumor type (solid tumors and
hematologic malignancies).
To normalize these data for changes in total patient
volumes over time, we calculated the PRBC transfusion
rates per month by dividing the number of patients who
had at least 1 unit transfused by the total number of
patients seen at MD Anderson. And we calculated ESA
use by dividing the number of patients who received at
least 1 dose of ESA by the total number of patients seen at
MD Anderson.
Statistical Analysis
The proportions of ESAs and PRBCs were stratified
according to Hb level, as described above, and CochranArmitage trend tests were performed to determine the
proportions of changes over time. To determine whether
ESA or PRBC use changed from month to month, we
performed trend analyses by using linear regression analyses. The chi-square test was used to compare differences in
categorical variables. One-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was used to compare changes in number of
ESA doses among selected quarters of years. All tests were
conducted with a significance level of P < .05. All statistical analyses were performed by using SAS software (version 9.1.3; SAS, Chapel Hill, NC).

RESULTS
Patients Characteristics
We identified 7117 patients aged 18 years and older who
had received at least 1 ESA dose associated with a known
Hb value (Table 1). The patients’ median age was 61
years, and half were women. Most (81%) patients had
solid tumors.

Changes in ESA Usage
During the course of 3 years, 34,279 ESA doses were dispensed. This number decreased by 83% between January
2006, and December 2008 (P < .01), whereas the
number of patients who received ESAs decreased by 80%
(P < .01). We stratified the number of doses by disease
type (solid tumor or hematological malignancy) and
observed that the number of dispensed ESA doses at different Hb levels decreased during this study in both types
of cancers (Fig. 1). We also observed that the number of
doses dispensed each month decreased by 74%, 71%,
97%, 93%, and 100% in solid tumor patients with Hb
levels of <9, 9-<10, 10-<11, 11-<12, and 12 g/
dL, respectively and decreased by 70%, 75%, 94%, 98%,
and 98% in hematological malignancy patients between
January 2006 and December 2008. The proportion
of dispensed ESA doses at Hb level 12 g/dL decreased
from 4% to 0% (P < .01), and the proportion at Hb
level 10 g/dL decreased from 44% to 12% (P < .01).
To better describe the changes in ESA use, we compared the mean number of monthly ESA doses during
selected quarters (Fig. 2). There were no detected changes
in the numbers of monthly ESA doses by Hb levels from
the first quarter of 2006 through the fourth quarter of
2006 (all P-values were >.05). Substantial declines in the
number of monthly dispensed ESA doses by Hb levels
were observed (all P-values were <.05) during 2007 with
the greatest decline (80%) seen in the number of ESAs
prescribed for the Hb level of 11-<12, followed by the
Hb level of 12 (76%), and then the Hb level of 10<11 (68%). Further decreases in the use of ESAs was
reported between the fourth quarter of 2007 and the
fourth quarter of 2008 (all P-values were <.05; Fig. 2).
Changes in PRBC Transfusion
From 2006 to 2008, 115,980 PRBC units were ordered
for 13,681 patients. Patients with hematologic malignancies received a mean of 15 units per patient (48,902 units
for 3345 patients) compared with a mean of 7 units
(67,078 units for 10,336 patients) for solid tumor
patients (P < .01). We calculated the number of PRBC
units ordered each month and stratified these data by Hb
level (<7.0, 7.0-<9.0, 9.0-<10.0, 10.0-<11.0,
11.0-<12.0, and 12.0 g/dL) within 7 days of a PRBC
order. The practice patterns of ordering PRBCs according
to Hb levels is presented in Figure 3. We found there was
no sharp increase or decrease observed in the number of
units delivered over time. Most PRBC units were administered to patients with Hb < 9.0 g/dL (99% hematologic
malignancies and 84% solid tumors [P < .01]).

ESA and PRBC Utilization
ESA utilization rates significantly decreased from 4% of
patients with solid tumors (606 patients of 16,032 patients)
and 5% of patients with hematological malignancies (187
patients of 3778 patients) in January 2006 to 0.7% (126
patients of 17,606 patients; P < .01) and 0.9% (36 patients
of 3867 patients; P < .01) in December 2008, respectively
(Fig. 4). The PRBC transfusion rate remained stable at 3%
in both January 2006 and December 2008 in solid tumor
patients (P > .05) but significantly increased from 7% to 9%
(P < .05) in patients with hematologic malignancies (Fig. 4).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we evaluated ESA and PRBC use at our institution during changes in ESA labeling and before and after
the implementation of institutional clinical management
tools for anemia. ESA use remained stable at our institution
during the year 2006. A decrease in ESA use begun at our

3272

institution starting in early 2007, indicating increased awareness of the potential risks associated with these agents. In
September 2007, institutionally derived anemia treatment
algorithms and order sets were developed to ensure that 1)
ESAs are prescribed for appropriate indications and Hb values, 2) optimal ESA therapy is used (eg, dose escalation or
discontinuation in patients who do not experience a
response), and 3) education is disseminated concerning
safety and reimbursement through use of order sets that are
widely available in our electronic medical record system.
Our initiatives were based on earlier research results that
showed how organizational strategies, such as institutional
practice algorithms, can contribute to adherence to nationally recognized best clinical practices.21,22 Following the
introduction of anemia management algorithms and order
sets, ESA use further decreased, with the largest decline
observed in patients with solid tumors and patients whose
Hb levels were >10 g/dL.

The approval of ESA use in patients with cancer was based
on improvements in anemia, in reduction in transfusion
requirements, and to quality of life.3,4,9 On the basis of
these findings, many clinicians raised the question whether
the decrease in the use of ESAs would lead to increases in
the need for blood transfusions. In our experience, despite
the dramatic reduction in ESA use during a period of 3
years, PRBC transfusion requirements remained stable in
patients with solid tumors (P > .05). In patients with hematological malignancies, the decrease in ESA use was associated with a small, but statistically significant, increase in
PRBC transfusions (P < .05). These findings are concordant with a large study based on Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results-Medicare data (SEER-Medicare), which
failed to demonstrate a significant reduction in PRBC
transfusions during a rapid increase in ESA use among
56,210 patients with cancer (data included in the SEERMedicare study were largely from patients with solid tumor) between 1991 and 2002.23 The highly regulated use
of blood products and decreasing use of ESAs raise a concern regarding the possible undertreatment of patients with
moderate anemia, which was suggested in a recently published retrospective study from another single institution.24
In our study, we were unable to address whether there was

3274

a change in the severity of anemia or quality of life following the decrease in ESA use. These important questions can
only be answered by prospective randomized clinical trials
that will capture data on concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgical interventions, and other risk factors (eg,
metastatic cancer, nutritional deficiencies, comorbidities)
that influence blood loss or production of red blood cells.
Quality of life information will also need to be an integral
component of such a study.
We were unable to capture all data on concurrent
chemotherapy or radiotherapy in this patient population.
A large proportion of patients received these therapies
outside of our institution, and dates of administration
could not be confirmed. This is a limitation of our study.
Second, our analysis did not analyze other risk factors that
may influence blood loss or production of red blood cells
(eg, metastatic cancer, comorbidities, surgery). If these
factors changed over the duration of the study, then this
also may have impacted our results, especially related to
blood transfusions. Because the main purpose of our
analysis was to assess ESA use in our overall patient population, we did not limit inclusion only to those with diseases for which ESA treatment is approved by regulatory
agencies. Therefore, we could not differentiate between

chemotherapy-induced anemia and cancer-related
anemia.
In this study, we showed that ESA use dramatically
decreased in our cancer patients between 2006 and 2008.
This decrease was not associated with an increased PRBC
transfusion rate in solid tumor patients but was associated
with an increase in blood use in hematologic malignancy
patients. The goal of our report is to share the experience
of our center with the implementation of care management tools in the specific setting of changing guidelines
for anemia management in cancer patients. Our experience indicates that following initial reductions in the use
of ESAs due to safety concerns, the pattern of use of ESAs
during the remainder of the study suggests that patient
care management tools such as algorithms and standardized order sets facilitate implementation of best practices
in a large academic facility.
