BACKGROUND: Anemia is an expected consequence of intensive chemotherapy regimens administered to patients
with acute leukemia. This study was designed to determine whether epoetin alpha would decrease the number of
transfusion events and units of packed erythrocytes (PRBCs) transfused, and the secondary objective was to study
the effects of epoetin alpha on quality of life (QOL) and complete remission (CR) rates. METHODS: Patients with
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL), or Burkitt lymphoma (BL) who were receiving
frontline myelosuppressive chemotherapy were randomized to receive epoetin alpha or no epoetin during the first 6
cycles of their planned chemotherapy. QOL was assessed by using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale
(ESAS) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Anemia questionnaires. RESULTS: Fifty-five
patients were randomized to receive epoetin alpha, and 54 patients received no epoetin. Transfusion data were
available for 79 of 81 evaluable patients (98%) who completed the treatment/observation period. The trial was
stopped early because of poor accrual before the target of 123 evaluable patients was met. A mean of 10.6 units of
PRBCs over 5 months were administered to those who received epoetin alpha compared with 13 units for those who
did not receive epoetin (P ¼ .04). There was no significant difference in QOL as assessed by the FACT-Anemia or
ESAS instruments. The CR rate and the 3-year CR duration were not affected adversely by use of epoetin alpha.
CONCLUSIONS: Epoetin alpha decreased the number of PRBC transfusions and did not appear to have a negative

INTRODUCTION
Anemia is 1 of the most common manifestations of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), lymphoblastic lymphoma
(LL), and Burkitt lymphoma (BL). A variety of symptoms can occur, depending on the degree of anemia, including
fatigue, weakness, hypersensitivity to cold, dyspnea, tachycardia, dizziness, and acute coronary syndromes.1 In addition,
the induction and consolidation phases of chemotherapy for ALL, LL, and BL are significantly myelosuppressive, further

contributing to the severity of the anemia.2 Thus, transfusion support of packed erythrocytes (PRBCs) becomes
critical in minimizing the potential complications of
severe anemia.
Although screening techniques have been improved
substantially in recent years, transfusion of PRBCs still
represents a risk of morbidity for the recipient, mainly
related to infection.3-6 In addition, other potential complications include volume overload (predominantly in elderly patients or those with underlying congestive heart
failure) and iron overload (when multiple transfusions are
administered).7,8 On rare occasions, frequent transfusions
can result in the development of alloantibodies, which
ultimately limit or delay the availability of compatible
PRBCs. Interventions that could lead to even a modest
decrease in transfusion requirements would represent a
major advantage for patients who receive myelosuppressive chemotherapy for ALL, LL, or BL.
We hypothesized that epoetin alpha, an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent, could benefit patients with ALL,
LL, or BL by decreasing PRBC transfusion requirements
after frontline induction and consolidation chemotherapy. Therefore, we designed a randomized study comparing outcome measures between the 2 groups (epoetin
alpha vs no epoetin alpha) with respect to transfusions of
PRBCs, response, response duration, and quality of life
(QOL).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria
Patients who were receiving induction chemotherapy at
The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center
(MDACC) with either hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating with high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine (the
hyper-CVAD regimen) or augmented Berlin-FrankfurtMuenster (BFM) regimens for the treatment of newly
diagnosed ALL, LL, or BL were eligible.9-13 Patients in

first relapse who had a remission duration 12 months
also were eligible. There were no age restrictions. Deficiencies of vitamin B12, folate, or iron were allowed provided that replacement therapy was initiated. Enrollment
was not allowed if the baseline hemoglobin level was
>10 g/dL or if erythropoietin had been administered
within the previous 3 months. Uncontrolled hypertension, a previous thrombotic event, and/or poorly controlled
or new-onset seizure disorder were contraindications to
participation. The enrollment period included the first 14
days from the start of induction chemotherapy. Patients
had to provide written informed consent for participation.
Study Design and Therapy
Details of the treatment regimens (hyper-CVAD including rituximab for CD20-positive ALL or BL and imatinib
for Philadelphia chromosome [Ph]-positive ALL or an
augmented BFM regimen) were detailed previously.9-13
Once enrolled, patients were randomized to either epoetin
alpha or no epoetin alpha during the first 6 cycles of their
planned chemotherapy. Patients were randomized 1-to-1
and were balanced with respect to the treatment in each
stratum using the Pocock and Simon algorithm14 for 3
age categories (ages 18 years, 19-59 years, and 60
years). Epoetin alpha was administered at a starting dose
of 40,000 U subcutaneously once weekly. If, after 4 weeks
of therapy, an increase 1 g/dL in the hemoglobin level
from the baseline value was not achieved, then the dose of
epoetin alpha was increased to 60,000 U subcutaneously
per week. In patients aged <18 years, the starting dose of
epoetin alpha was 600 U/kg per week delivered subcutaneously to a maximum dose of 40,000 U per week. Doses
were escalated to 900 U/kg per week (maximum, 60,000
U per week) for patients who did not achieve an increase
1 g/dL in hemoglobin level. If, after 4 weeks on the
maximal dose of epoetin alpha, an increase 1 g/dL in hemoglobin was not achieved, then study participation was
discontinued. Failure to achieve complete remission (CR)
after 2 courses of induction chemotherapy or disease recurrence after initial CR also resulted in withdrawal from
the trial. Epoetin alpha was withheld if the hemoglobin
level 10 g/dL and was resumed when the hemoglobin
fell below 10 g/dL. All epoetin alpha injections were
administered by a health care provider. Neither patients
nor physicians were blinded to treatment. Hemoglobin
was evaluated on at least a weekly basis in all patients.
PRBC transfusions were administered according to
MDACC institutional standards in both arms (Table 1).
For patients who received interim care outside MDACC,

years, 19-59 years, and 60 years).

the local physicians were requested to adhere to the
MDACC PRBC transfusion guidelines if feasible,
although deviations were allowed at the physician’s discretion if deemed in the best interest of the patient. All transfusions of PRBCs were verified.
QOL assessments were performed using the
Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS)15,16 and
the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia
(FACT-An)17 QOL questionnaires at study entry and
before each chemotherapy cycle in patients who agreed to
participate in this optional part of the study. The ESAS
assesses symptoms of pain, fatigue (tired), depression, well
being, and shortness of breath, among others. The FACTAn evaluates well being and fatigue.
Statistical Methods
The primary endpoint was to compare the number of
PRBC transfusions after at least 5 weeks of treatment in
patients who received epoetin alpha versus the control
arm. The secondary endpoint was to investigate any possible adverse effect of epoetin alpha on the CR rate and on
progression-free survival (PFS). A projected sample of
164 patients was required to determine statistical superiority. However, a significant decrease in accrual was
observed after an adverse influence of epoetin alpha on
survival in solid tumor malignancies was reported. Therefore, the study was terminated early in October 2008 after
109 patients had been enrolled. Baseline demographics
and clinical characteristics were summarized as descriptive
statistics, including mean and median values (including

850

ranges and standard deviations), or the frequency for each
of the continuous or categorical variables, respectively.
With respect to the primary endpoint of the study,
the overall number of PRBC units transfused (including
frequency per week) was tallied during the study period
(starting at 5 weeks through 5 months from study enrollment). In addition, the maximum change in hemoglobin
level from baseline also was computed. The Wilcoxon
rank-sum test was used to compare these computed values
between the 2 treatment groups. The Fisher exact test was
used to compare the proportion of relapses between the 2
treatment groups. The Kaplan-Meier method was applied
to estimate the probabilities of PFS and overall survival
(OS), and differences were analyzed with the log-rank test.
With respect to QOL assessments, a fitting linear
mixed model was used to estimate the effect of treatment
with or without epoetin alpha on QOL outcomes. Spearman
correlation coefficients were used to assess the correlation of
hemoglobin with fatigue scales (on both questionnaires) at
the baseline, midpoint and end of study time points.

RESULTS
Clinical Characteristics
From September 2003 to July 2008, 109 patients were
randomized to receive epoetin alpha (n ¼ 54) or no epoetin
alpha (n ¼ 55) (Fig. 1). Of these, 28 patients withdrew early
for the following reasons: 7 patients subsequently declined to
participate; 7 patients developed toxicity, which mandated
their removal from the study (see below); 6 patients developed disease-related complications, prohibiting continuation

fifth week until end of 5 months from the time of enrollment. There was no significant difference in the number
of PRBC transfusion events per week between the 2 treatment groups (P ¼ .089) (Table 3). However, the mean
number of PRBC units transfused in the epoetin alpha
group was significantly lower than that in the control
group (P ¼ .04). No significant difference was detected in
the maximum change in hemoglobin levels from baseline
between the 2 treatment groups (P ¼ .21). The majority
of patients (75%) required at least 1 dose escalation to
60,000 U epoetin alpha per week.
Quality of Life
Seventy-four patients participated in the QOL endpoint,
of which 40 patients (54%) were receiving epoetin alpha.
No significant differences between the 2 treatment groups

852

were detected with the ESAS scales or the FACT-An questionnaire. There were no significant associations between
hemoglobin levels and fatigue scores on either scale.
Disease Response Outcomes
The CR rate was 95% for those who received hyperCVAD (n ¼ 106) and 100% for those who received the
BFM regimen (n ¼ 3). In the epoetin alpha group, 2
patients who received hyper-CVAD had a partial response
(both had LL with imaging studies suggestive of persistent
adenopathy), and 1 patient failed to respond. In the control group, 1 patient had a partial response (LL with residual adenopathy), and 1 patient died before response could
be assessed. There were no statistically significant differences in the CR rate between the treatment and control
groups (P ¼ .62). The median PFS rate was 41% (95%

confidence interval, 24.6 to not available) for the epoetin
alpha group versus 50.3% (95% confidence interval, 39.6
to not available) for the control group (P ¼ .58) (Fig. 2).
Overall Survival
The analysis of OS included all 109 randomized patients.
There were 40 deaths overall (37%), including 20 deaths
(37%) in the control arm and 20 deaths (36%) in the
epoetin alpha arm. The median OS has not been reached.
There were no significant differences in OS between the 2
treatment arms (P ¼ .96) (Fig. 3).
Safety
Eight patients in the epoetin alpha arm had adverse events,
6 of which were attributed to epoetin therapy (5 thrombotic events, 1 seizure). Only 1 of the 5 patients who had a
thrombotic event (lower extremity deep vein thrombosis)
had been dose escalated to 60,000 U per week. Six patients
in the no epoetin alpha arm also had similar serious adverse
events (including 2 thrombotic events and 2 seizures).
There was no statistical difference in the rate of thrombotic
events between the 2 groups (P ¼ .44).

DISCUSSION
In this study using epoetin alpha during intensive induction and consolidation chemotherapy (hyper-CVAD or
Cancer

augmented BFM) in patients with newly diagnosed ALL,
LL, or BL, we observed a modest but statistically significant decrease in the number of PRBC units transfused per
week compared with the no epoetin alpha arm. For 79
evaluable patients who completed the 5-month observation period, the mean number of units transfused was
10.6 units in the epoetin alpha arm compared with 13
units in the no epoetin alpha group (P ¼ .04).
Several studies have demonstrated a beneficial effect
of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents on the QOL of
patients receiving chemotherapy.18-23 In our study, we
did not demonstrate a statistically significant, beneficial
effect of epoetin alpha on QOL; however, the number of
patients studied for this endpoint was small, and the study
was not powered for this endpoint.
There have been significant concerns regarding the
potential deleterious effects of erythropoiesis-stimulating
agents in solid tumors. This issue surfaced in 2005, when
data emerged regarding the association between erythropoiesis-stimulating agent use and poorer tumor-related
outcomes in patients who received chemotherapy for
breast cancer.24 That study was halted early because of the
higher mortality observed in the epoetin-treated patients.
However, the dosing of epoetin alpha was designed to
achieve and maintain hemoglobin levels above 12 g/dL, a
practice that is not recommended with erythropoiesis-

853

Original Article

stimulating agents. In addition, some prognostic factors
favored the placebo group, which may have influenced
the proportion of tumor progression-related deaths in the
erythropoiesis-stimulating agent-treated groups. Several
other studies in different tumor types have demonstrated
adverse effects on survival; however, all of those studies
were designed to target hemoglobin levels 12 g/dL.24-28
In contrast, other studies using epoetin alpha have
reported either modest benefits or no differences in survival.22,29-32 In our study, hemoglobin levels were carefully monitored, and epoetin alpha was discontinued if
the hemoglobin level rose above 10 g/dL. There was no
significant increase in the number of thrombotic events in
patients who received epoetin alpha compared with those
who did not. It is noteworthy that none of these events
were fatal. More important, the use of epoetin alpha had
no negative effect on the rates of remission, response duration, or OS. Thus, the possible negative effect observed
with the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents under
certain circumstances in some tumors should not be extrapolated to all cancers considering the difference in
patient populations, biology of the disease, chemotherapy
agents, expected long-term outcomes, and other variables.
This study is not without its limitations. First,
because of the rarity of aggressive lymphoid leukemias in
the adult population, the number of patients studied was
relatively small. Second, the study was not placebo-controlled, which could have introduced physician bias with
respect to the frequency of transfusions and the number of
units administered. Finally, the study was terminated
early because of a sharp reduction in accrual once information regarding the potential adverse effect of epoetin
alpha on survival was incorporated into the informed consent document for the study. This resulted in patient
reluctance to participate in the study. However, there was
no evidence that epoetin alpha as administered in our
study had any deleterious effects on outcome (similar rates
of CR, 5-year PFS, and toxicity).
Although the early termination of the study did not
allow us to reach any firm conclusions, our results suggest
that the use of epoetin alpha can decrease the requirements for PRBC transfusions in patients with ALL, LL,
and BL who are receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. With the use of appropriate parameters for epoetin
alpha dosing, including interruption of therapy when hemoglobin levels increased beyond 10g/dL, the risk of
thrombotic events was not increased. The use of epoetin
alpha had no adverse impact on disease outcomes, such as
response or survival. Additional prospective studies clearly

854

are warranted to better define the risks and potential benefits of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in specific patient
populations.
