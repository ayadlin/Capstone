Abstract

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Mutations of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) enzyme fumarate hydratase (FH) cause
Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer (HLRCC)1. FH-deficient renal cancers are
highly aggressive and metastasise even when small, leading to an abysmal clinical outcome2.
Fumarate, a small molecule metabolite that accumulates in FH-deficient cells, plays a key role in
cell transformation, making it a bona fide oncometabolite3. Fumarate was shown to inhibit αketoglutarate (aKG)-dependent dioxygenases involved in DNA and histone demethylation4,5.
However, the link between fumarate accumulation, epigenetic changes, and tumorigenesis is
unclear. Here we show that loss of FH and the subsequent accumulation of fumarate elicits an
epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT), a phenotypic switch associated with cancer
initiation, invasion, and metastasis6. We demonstrate that fumarate inhibits Tet-mediated
demethylation of a regulatory region of the antimetastatic miRNA cluster6 miR-200ba429, leading
to the expression of EMT-related transcription factors and enhanced migratory properties. These
epigenetic and phenotypic changes are recapitulated by the incubation of FH-proficient cells with
cell-permeable fumarate. Loss of FH is associated with suppression of miR-200 and EMT
signature in renal cancer patients, and is associated with poor clinical outcome. These results
imply that loss of FH and fumarate accumulation contribute to the aggressive features of FHdeficient tumours.
To identify oncogenic features associated with FH loss we performed unbiased proteomics
analyses of mouse (Fh1-/-) and human (UOK262) FH-deficient cells7 (Extended Data Fig.
1). We found that vimentin, a known EMT marker, is the most overexpressed protein in
these cells, compared to FH-proficient counterparts (Fig. 1a). Gene expression profiling
(Fig. 1b) followed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)8 confirmed an enrichment of
EMT-related genes in FH-deficient cells (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 3a,
respectively). The reintroduction of full-length Fh1 (pFh1) in Fh1-/- cells (Extended Data
Fig. 1a-e) was sufficient to rescue the EMT signature (Extended Data Fig. 2a and Extended
Data Fig. 2c), to abolish vimentin expression (Fig. 1c-e), and to restore expression of ECadherin (Fig. 1c-d), a key epithelial marker. Fh1-/-+pFh1 cells acquired an epithelial
morphology (Extended Data Fig. 1e) and their motility was reduced compared to that of
Fh1-deficient cells (Fig. 1f-g). UOK262 cells exhibited a strong Vimentin expression
(Extended Data Fig. 3b-d), and increased migration (Extended data Fig. 3e) compared to
UOK262pFH. However, localisation of E-Cadherin at the plasma membrane was not
observed in UOK262pFH (Extended Data Fig. 3d).

EMT is orchestrated by several transcription factors, including Twist, Snai1, Snai2, and
Zeb1/2 (ref 9). Twist, which is activated by the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor HIF1 (ref 10), a
key player in FH-deficient tumours11, was elevated in Fh1-deficient cells (Fig. 1h). The
silencing of HIF1β, the constitutively expressed subunit of HIFs required for their
transcriptional activity12, failed to reduce the expression of EMT markers (Extended Data
Fig. 4a-b), suggesting that EMT in Fh1-deficient cells is likely HIF-independent. Snai2,
Zeb1 and Zeb2 were also induced in Fh1-deficient cells, and their expression was reverted
by Fh1 re-expression in these cells (Fig. 1h-i). Zeb2 expression was also decreased upon FH
restoration in UOK262 cells (Extended Data Fig. 3f). Snai2 and Zeb1/2 are suppressed by
antimetastatic miRNAs miR-200ba429 and the miR-200c141 (ref 6). miRNA profiling
revealed that miR-200 family members were among the most down-regulated miRNAs in
Fh1-deficient cells (Fig. 2a). Suppression of MIR-200 was also observed in UOK262 cells
compared to the non-transformed counterpart HK2 and partially restored by FH reexpression (Extended Data Fig. 3g-h). qPCR confirmed the miRNA profiling results and
showed that the reconstitution of Fh1 in Fh1-deficient cells restored the expression levels of
miR-200a and miR-200b and, in part, that of miR-200c and miR-141 (Fig. 2b). We
hypothesised that the partial restoration of miR-200c141 could be ascribed to the residual
fumarate in Fh1-/-+pFh1 cells (Extended Data Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 5b), which
could also explain the partial recovery of the EMT gene signature (Extended Data Fig. 2a-c).
Blunting fumarate levels by re-expressing high levels of Fh1 in Fh1-/- cells rescued their
phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 5b-g) and led to a full reactivation of the entire miR-200
family (Extended Data Fig. 5h), indicating that members of this family have a different
susceptibility to fumarate. The incomplete rescue of fumarate levels in UOK262pFH (ref 7)
could also explain the partial restoration of MIRNAs and some EMT markers in these cells.

Since miR-200ba429 expression was fully restored in Fh1-/-+pFh1 and its expression was
sufficient to suppress vimentin and rescue E-cadherin expression in Fh1-deficient cells (Fig.
2c), we investigated the role of this miRNA cluster in Fh1-dependent EMT. Repression of
miR-200 is associated with its epigenetic silencing via CpG island hypermethylation13,
which can also be caused by downregulation of Tets14,15. We hypothesised that fumarate
could cause suppression of miR-200ba429 by inhibiting their Tets-mediated demethylation.
The combined silencing of Tet2 and Tet3, the most abundant Tets isoform in Fh1fl/fl cells
(Extended Data Fig. 6a), but not the inhibition of aKG-dependent histone demethylases with
GSK-J4 (ref 16), decreased miRNAs and E-Cadherin expression (Extended Data Fig. 6b-e),
highlighting the role of Tets in regulating EMT, in line with previous findings14,15. Genome
Browser17 view of an ENCODE dataset generated in mouse kidney cells revealed a
conserved CpG island at the 5’ end of miR-200ba429, CpG43, that is enriched in binding
sites for Tets and for lysine-methylated histone H3 (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments showed that a region adjacent to CpG43 is
enriched for the repressive marks H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 and depleted of the permissive
marks H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac in Fh1-deficient cells (Extended Data Fig. 7b) in the
absence of changes in H3K4 and H3K27 methylation among the four cell lines (Extended
data Fig. 7c). Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) analysis18 identified a physical
association between this regulatory region and the transcription starting site of
miR-200ba429, which sits in the intronic region of the gene Ttl10 (Extended Data Fig. 7d).

This region was hypermethylated in Fh1-deficient cells and the re-expression of Fh1
restored its methylation levels (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 7e). Binding of Tets to the
CpG43 was comparable among the cell line tested (Extended Data Fig. 7f), suggesting that
the changes in methylation of this region are, at least in part, caused by inhibition of Tets
enzymatic activity rather than by their differential binding to chromatin. Consistently, 5hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmc), the product of oxidation of 5-methylcytosine by Tets15, was
significantly decreased in Fh1-deficient cells (Extended Data Fig. 7g).

Incubating cells with dimethyl aKG (DM-aKG), a cell-permeable derivative of aKG, known
to reactivate aKG-dependent dioxygenases19, restored the expression miR-200a in Fh1deficient cells (Extended Data Fig. 6f). Conversely, treating Fh1fl/fl and human FHproficient epithelial kidney cells HK2 with monomethyl fumarate (MMF), a cell permeable
derivative of fumarate triggered profound phenotypical (Extended Data Fig. 8a) and
(epi)genetic (Fig. 3a-g) changes that resembled those of FH-deficient cells. However, we
could not observe induction of Snai2 that we observed in Fh1-/- cells (Fig. 1h) and changes
in Vimentin in HK2 cells, which is expressed in these cells22, despite their epithelial origin.
MMF did not cause mitochondrial dysfunction but lead to a typical fumarate-dependent
metabolic signature, characterised in both cell types by accumulation of fumarate and
fumarate-derived succinic-GSH (succGSH) and succinic-cysteine (2SC) that we and others
recently described20,21 (Extended Data Fig. 8b-c and SI Table 3). To rule out the possibility
that by-products of fumarate accumulation, rather than fumarate itself, elicit EMT we
analysed the effects of accumulation of succinate, another metabolite that can inhibit Tets3–
5, but cannot promote succination. Since we could not increase succinate levels with the cell
permeable dimethyl succinate (Extended Data Fig. 9a) we used succinate dehydrogenase b
(Sdhb)-deficient cell lines23, which accumulate succinate but not fumarate by-products,
including succGSH (Extended Data Fig. 9b-c). These cells exhibited striking mesenchymal
features (Extended Data Fig. 9d-e), and epigenetic suppression of the miR-200ba429 family
(Extended Data Fig. 9f-g), in line with the hypermethylation phenotype and EMT signature
recently observed in SDH-deficient cells24.
We next investigated the link between FH loss, fumarate accumulation and EMT in renal
cancer samples. Vimentin was highly expressed and E-Cadherin was decreased in a
previously published dataset25 of HLRCC tumour samples, when compared to normal tissue
(Extended Data Fig. 10a). Two HLRCC tumours that we profiled (Fig. 4a), exhibited
decreased 5hmC levels (Fig. 4b) despite comparable TETs levels (Extended Data Fig. 10b),
MIR-200 suppression (Fig. 4c), a marked Vimentin staining and loss of E-Cadherin
(Extended Data Fig 10b), compared to matched normal tissue. We also took advantage of
data from a collection of papillary renal-cell carcinoma (KIRP), a tumour type associated
with loss of FH26. These tumours exhibited a partial EMT signature (Extended Data Fig.
10c) and downregulation of MIR-200 (Extended Data Fig. 10d). FH levels were positively
correlated with patients’ survival (Extended Data Fig. 10e) in line with the poor prognosis
associated with EMT6. The five FH-mutant tumours in this cohort exhibited overexpression
of Vimentin and suppression of E-Cadherin (Extended Data Fig. 10f), hypermethylation and
suppression of MIR-200A and MIR-200B (Fig. 4d-e) in the absence of TETs mutations
(Extended Data Fig. 10g). These tumours were associated with the worst prognosis among
papillary cancers (Extended Data Fig. 10h). FH mRNA was also significantly decreased in a

negatively correlated with Vimentin (Pearson correlation coefficient of -0.5, p-value < 1e-5;
Fig. 4f) and positively with E-Cadherin (Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.22, p-value <
1e-5; Fig. 4g), and were positively correlated with patients’ survival (Extended Data Fig.
10k), confirming the role of FH in tumour malignancy and patient outcome.

Our results report a novel link between the loss of FH and epigenetic suppression of
miR-200 mediated by fumarate (see Extended Data Fig. 1f for a schematic). Although other
mechanisms could contribute to fumarate-driven EMT, our findings offer an explanation for
the suppression of MIR-200 in papillary and clear-cell renal carcinoma and the expression of
EMT-related transcription factors, including ZEB2, in KIRC28. Our data imply that
dysregulation of FH activity and fumarate accumulation have roles in EMT induction and
may feature in other tumour types where FH loss has been reported, including
neuroblastoma29, colorectal and lung cancer30.

Cell culture—Fh1-proficient (Fh1fl/fl), and the two Fh1-deficient clones (Fh1-/-CL1, and
Fh1-/-CL19) cells were obtained as previously described7. Fh1-/-+pFh1 were single clones
generated from Fh1-/-CL19 after stable expression of a plasmid carrying mouse wild-type Fh1
gene (Origene, MC200586). Mouse cells were cultured using DMEM (Gibco-41966-029)
supplemented with 10% heat inactivated serum (Gibco-10270-106) and 50 µg x
mL-1uridine. Genotyping of cells was assessed as previously described7. Human FHdeficient (UOK262) and FH-restored (UOK262pFH) were obtained as previously described7
and cultured in DMEM (Gibco-41966-029) supplemented with 10% serum heat inactivated
(Gibco-10270-106). HK2 cells were a gift from the laboratory of E.R.M. These cells were
authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat and cultured in DMEM (Gibco-41966-029)
supplemented with heat inactivated 10% serum. All cell lines have been tested for
mycoplasma contamination using MycoProbe® Mycoplasma Detection Kit (R&D Systems
CUL001B), and were confirmed mycoplasma-free.
Generation of Fh1-/-+pFh1-GFP cells—Fh1-GFP vector was generated by amplifying
wild-type Fh1 sequence using cDNA generated from Fh1fl/fl cells by PCR. Restriction
overhangs (KpnI, EcoRI) were included in the primer sequence allowing for restriction
enzyme cloning of Fh1 into the backbone vector pEF1α-V5/His (Life Technology). We then
used a two-step PCR “restriction-free” method to swap the V5-His sequence within pEF1α
with the AcGFP sequence to yield a fusion protein, Fh1-GFP. 1x105 Fh1-/- CL1 cells were
plated onto 6-well plate and the day after transfected with Fh1-GFP vector using
Lipofectamine 2000 following manufacturer’s instructions. After 2 weeks, cells were sorted

Migration assay—Migration experiments were performed using xCELLigence instrument
(ACEA Biosciences). In brief, 5x104 cells were plated onto CIM plates in medium
supplemented with 1% FBS. Complete medium with 20% FBS was used as chemo
attractant. Migration was registered in real time for at least 24 hours and cell index was
calculated using the appropriate function of the xCELLigence software.
Motility assay—5x104 mouse cells of the indicated genotype were plated the day before
the experiment onto 6-cm dishes. The day after, medium was replaced with fresh medium
containing Hoechst (Sigma-Aldrich) and cells were incubated for 15 minutes at 37°C with
5% CO2 before starting recording. Images were collected every minute for 3 hours using a
Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope with a 10x objective. Analysis of cells movement was
performed using cell tracker (www.celltracker.website) implemented in MATLAB
(MATLAB R2013b, The MathWorks Inc., 2013) as previously described32. Three replicates
were analysed for each cell type. All tracks were examined and those belonging to nonisolated cells deleted. Average speed for each cell was calculated as the sum length of the
cell’s trajectory divided by the total time over which the trajectory was measured. Since the
data were not normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test), a Mann-Whitney test was used to
compare the average speeds of the cells.

μL T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen). Ligation mixture was then incubated with Proteinase K
(Roche) at 65°C overnight to reverse the crosslinking and was incubated with RNase A
(Roche) at 37°C for 1 hour. DNA was purified with Phenol (pH 8.0, Sigma) once and then
with Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl Alcohol (25:24:1, pH 8.0, Sigma), followed by ethanol
precipitation by adding 2.5 volume of ice-cold 100% ethanol and 1/10 volume of 3 M
sodium acetate (pH 5.2, Lonza). DNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol twice and was
eventually dissolved in 100 μL distilled water. The concentration of 3C DNA was
determined by Qubit dsDNA HS assays (Invitrogen). 100 ng DNA was taken to run qPCR in
duplicate wells for each 3C sample, using Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems) and specific Taqman primers and probes on ABI 7900 (Applied Biosystems)
following manufacturer’s instruction. Data were analysed as recommended18 and were
normalized to the internal loading control of Gapdh locus. Calculation of primers location
was based on the transcription start site (TSS) of Ttll10 transcript
(ENSMUST00000097731). Oligo sequences are listed in the SI Table 1.

Metabolomic analyses—3x105 cells were plated onto a 6-well plate and cultured in
standard conditions for 24 hours. Medium was replenished with fresh one and, after 24
hours, intracellular metabolites were extracted as previously described20. LCMS analysis
was performed on a QExactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled to Dionex UltiMate
3000 Rapid Separation LC system (Thermo). The liquid chromatography system was fitted
with either a SeQuant Zic-HILIC column (column A, 150 mm × 4.6 mm, internal diameter
3.5 µm), or a SeQuant Zic-pHilic (column B, 150 mm × 2.1 mm, internal diameter 3.5 µm)
with guard columns (20 mm × 2.1 mm, internal diameter 3.5 µm) both from Merck
(Darmstadt, Germany). With column A, the mobile phase was composed by 0.1% aqueous
formic acid (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B). The flow rate was
set at 300 μL x min-1 and the gradient was as follows: 0-5 min 80 % B, 5-15 min 15 min
30% B, 15-20 min 10 % B, 20-21 min 80% B, hold at 80% B for 9 minutes. For column B,
the mobile phase was composed of 20 mM ammonium carbonate and 0.1% ammonium
hydroxide in water (solvent C), and acetonitrile (solvent D). The flow rate was set at 180 µL
x min-1 with the following gradient: 0 min 70% D, 1 min 70% D, 16 min 38% D, 16.5 min
70% D, hold at 70% D for 8.5 minutes. The mass spectrometer was operated in full MS and
polarity switching mode. Samples were randomised, in order to avoid machine drift, and
were blinded to the operator. The acquired spectra were analysed using XCalibur Qual
Browser and XCalibur Quan Browser softwares (Thermo Scientific) by referencing to an
internal library of compounds. Calibration curves were generated using synthetic standards
of the indicated metabolites.
Proteomics analysis—Proteomics experiments were performed using mass spectrometry
as reported before34,35. In brief, cells were lysed in urea lysis buffer (8 M urea, 10 mM
Na3VO4, 100 mM β-Glycerol phosphate and 25 mM Na2H2P2O7 and supplemented with
phosphatases inhibitors-Sigma) and proteins reduced and alkylated by sequential addition of
1 mM DTT and 5 mM iodoacetamide. Immobilised trypsin was then added to digest proteins
into peptides. After overnight incubation with trypsin, peptides were desalted by solid phase
extraction (SPE) using OASIS HLB columns (Waters) in a vacuum manifold following

Dried peptide extracts were dissolved in 0.1% TFA and analysed by nanoflow LCMS/MS in
an LTQ-orbitrap as described before34,35. Gradient elution was from 2% to 35% buffer B in
90 minutes with buffer A being used to balance the mobile phase (buffer A was 0.1% formic
acid in water and B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). MS/MS was acquired in
multistage acquisition mode. MS raw files were converted into Mascot Generic Format using
Mascot Distiller (version 1.2) and searched against the SwissProt database (version 2013.03)
restricted to human entries using the Mascot search engine (version 2.38). Allowed mass
windows were 10 ppm and 600 mmu for parent and fragment mass to charge values,
respectively. Variable modifications included in searches were oxidation of methionine,
pyro-glu (N-term) and phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine. Results were
filtered to include those with a potential for false discovery rate less than 1% by comparing
with searches against decoy databases. Quantification was performed by obtaining peak
areas of extracted ion chromatographs (XICs) for the first three isotopes of each peptide ion
using Pescal 36,37. To account for potential shifts in retention times, these were recalculated for each peptide in each LCMS/MS run individually using linear regression based
on common ions across runs (a script written in python 2.7 was used for this retention time
alignment step). Mass and retention time windows of XICs were 7 ppm and 1.5 minutes,
respectively.

Toray miRNA array—Initial sample quality control was performed using a Bioanalyzer
2200 system in conjunction with the Total RNA Nano chip (Agilent, Cheadle UK). 250 ng
total RNA were labelled using the miRCURY LNA microRNA Hy5 Power labelling kit
(Exiqon, Vedbæk Denmark) according to the Toray array protocol. Samples were hybridized
to the Human/Mouse/Rat miRNA 4-plex miRBase v17 array (Toray, London UK) and
subsequently scanned using the 3D-Gene Scanner 3000 (Toray) according the
manufacturer’s instructions. Data was normalized according to instructions provided by
Toray. Briefly, presence or absence of signals was determined using a cut off defined as the
mean of the middle 90% of the blank control intensities (background average intensity)
+ 2σ. Positive control signals were removed and the background average intensity subtracted
from the signal intensities to give the background subtracted signal intensities (y).
Normalised signal intensities (NSI) were then calculated as follows: NSI = 25y/(y). Raw
data are presented in SI Table 4.
Mass spectrometry-based analysis of methylated DNA of HLRCC tumours—
DNA from healthy and tumour tissue was extracted using DNeasyKit (Qiagen) following
manufacturer’s instructions. 0.5-1 µg of DNA resuspended in 25 µL of water was first
denatured at 100°C for 30 seconds, cooled on ice, and then added of 2 µL of 20 mM ZnSO4.
DNA was digested at 50°C for 16 hours using 1 µL Nuclease P1 (200 units x mL-1, Sigma
Aldrich) and dephosphorylated at 65°C for 2 hours by adding 1 µL of Bacterial alkaline
phosphatase BAP (150 U x µL-1, Life Technology). pH was then adjusted using 30 µL of 0.5
M Tris-HCl pH 7.9 for one hour at 37°C.

Analysis of global levels of C, 5hmC and 5mC was performed on a QExactive Orbitrap mass
spectrometer coupled to a Dionex UltiMate 3000 Rapid Separation LC fitted with an
Acquity UHPLC HSS T3 column (100 x 2.1 mm, 1.8 µm particle size). The mobile phase
consisted of 0.1% aqueous formic acid (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile
(solvent B) at a flow rate of 300 µl x min-1. Calibration curves were generated using
synthetic standards for 2’-deoxycytidine, 5-methyl- and 5-hydroxymethyl-2’-deoxycytidine
(Berry&Associates). The mass spectrometer was set in a positive ion mode and operated in
parallel reaction monitoring. Ions of masses 228.10, 242.11, and 258.11 were fragmented
and full scans were acquired for the base fragments 112.0505, 126.0661, and 146.0611
± 5ppm (corresponding to C, 5mC and 5hmC, respectively). The extracted ion
chromatogram (EIC) of the corresponding base-fragment was extracted using the XCalibur
Qual Browser and XCalibur Quan Browser software (Thermo Scientific), and used for
quantification. Quantification was performed by comparison with the standard curve
obtained from the pure nucleoside standards running with the same batch of samples. The
level of 5hmC present in the sample was expressed as a percentage of total cytosine content.

Immunohistochemistry on HLRCC tumours—Specimens were formalin fixed and
embedded in paraffin wax; 3-μm serial sections mounted on Snowcoat X-tra slides
(Surgipath, Richmond, IL) were dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated using graded ethanol
washes. For antigen retrieval, sections were immersed in preheated DAKO target retrieval
solution (DAKO) and treated for 90 seconds in a pressure cooker. Sections analysed
contained both tumour and adjacent normal renal parenchyma acting as an internal control;
in addition, substitution of the primary antibody with antibody diluent was used as a
negative control. Antigen/antibody complexes were detected using the Envision system
(DAKO) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sections were counterstained with
hematoxylin for 30 seconds, dehydrated in graded ethanol washes, and mounted in DPX
(Lamb, London, United Kingdom). Antibodies used were: E-cadherin (HECD1, CRUK) and
vimentin (clone V9, Dako). TET1 (SAB 2501479) and TET2 (HPA 019032) antibodies were
purchased by Sigma Aldrich.
miRNA expression on HLRCC tumours—Total RNA was extracted from tumour and
healthy tissue using miRCURY kit (Exiqon, Denmark) following manufacture’s protocols.
RNA reverse-transcription and real-time qPCR were obtained as described above. Data are
normalised to healthy tissue using both SNORD61 and RNU6B as endogenous controls.
Clinical details of HLRCC patients—The patients consented to use of tissues for study
approved by the National Research Ethics Committee London (REF number 2002/6486 and
03/018). FH mutations in HLRCC Patient A is c.1300T>C, and in Patient B is c.1189G>A
Bioinformatics and statistical analyses—Volcano plots were generated using the

The TCGA RNA-seq and miRNA-seq data-sets for clear cell (KIRC) and papillary (KIRP)
renal carcinoma were downloaded from the Broad Firehose webpage (http://
gdac.broadinstitute.org/). Differential analysis was performed with R package Limma38
using voom40 to transform the RNA-seq counts. Cancer patients were ranked according to
FH expression and survival analysis was performed by comparing the overall survival time
of upper vs. lower quartile of the FH-ranked list of patients. Kaplan Meier curves were built
using in-house R scripts and significance was calculated using the R package Survival by
applying a χ2 test. Hive plots were generated using the R package “HiveR”.
Graphpad Prism 6 was used to generate graphs and perform statistical analysis (one-way
ANOVA test with Tukey’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons was used unless otherwise
indicated). ChIP statistical analysis was generated using Excel (Microsoft). Except for
metabolomic experiments, no randomization or blinding was performed. No statistical
method or power analysis was used to predetermine sample size.

leading to their epigenetic suppression. As a consequence, Zeb1/2 are de-repressed, eliciting
a signalling cascade that leads to EMT.
