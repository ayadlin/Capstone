Abstract
The role of vasculogenesis as opposed to angiogenesis in tumor formation has been little explored genetically. Endothelial cells that lack the MEK kinase MEKK3 cannot form vessels. In this study, we employed mice
with hematopoietic deletions of the Mekk3 gene to evaluate the importance of vasculogenesis in the formation
of Ewing's sarcoma tumors. Bone marrow cells (BM) from LacZ+ Mekk3-deficient conditional knockout mice
(Mekk3Δflox/- mice) were transplanted into irradiated nude mice before injection of Ewing's sarcoma cells.
Because the grafted Mekk3Δflox/- BM cells cannot contribute to vessel development in the same way as the
host Mekk3+/+ endothelial cells, angiogenesis is normal in the model whereas vasculogenesis is impaired. Four
weeks after BM transplant, Ewing's sarcoma TC71 or A4573 cells were injected, and tumor growth and vessel
density were compared. Strikingly, chimeric mice transplanted with Mekk3Δflox/- BM exhibited a reduction in
tumor growth and vessel density compared with mice transplanted with Mekk3Δflox/+ BM cells. Mekk3Δflox/cells that were LacZ positive were visualized within the tumor; however, few of the LacZ+ cells colocalized with
either CD31+ endothelial cells or desmin+ pericytes. Quantification of double-positive LacZ+ and CD31+ endothelial cells or LacZ+ and desmin+ pericytes confirmed that chimeric mice transplanted with Mekk3Δflox/- BM
were impaired for tumor vessel formation. In contrast, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Mekk3 in TC71 Ewing's
sarcoma cells had no effect on tumor growth or vessel density. Our findings indicate that vasculogenesis is critical
in the expansion of the tumor vascular network. Cancer Res; 70(4); 1334–43. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
New blood vessel formation is critical for tumor growth
and metastasis (1). Endothelial cells play an essential role
in this process (2–5). We previously showed that in addition
to angiogenesis, the migration of bone marrow (BM) cells into the Ewing's sarcoma tumor and their subsequent differentiation into endothelial cells and pericytes (vasculogenesis)
contributes to the growth of Ewing's sarcoma (6, 7). It is well
established that inhibiting angiogenesis suppresses tumor
growth (8, 9). However, the consequences of blocking vasculogenesis are unclear. Evaluating the importance of BM cells
and vasculogenesis to tumor growth requires an in vivo model in which vasculogenesis is selectively blocked but local angiogenesis can occur. Mitogen-activated protein kinases are
common mediators in the signal transduction pathways from
membrane to nucleus. These kinases sequentially activate
the downstream kinases and relay signals from extracellular
agonists to the designated targets. Mekk3 is a Ser/Thr protein
kinase of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase

gene family (10, 11). Mekk3 is involved in early embryonic
cardiovascular and blood vessel development. Deletion of
Mekk3 is embryonically lethal at embryonic day (E) 9.5 (12).
The Mekk3-deficient yolk sacs have few or no vessels, indicating that this gene plays an essential role in embryonic blood
vessel formation. Moreover, cells that lack Mekk3 do not
form normal vessels.
To evaluate the importance of vasculogenesis in the growth
and development of Ewing's sarcoma, we used Mekk3-deleted
BM cells from Mekk3Δflox/− conditional knockout mice as the
donor cells to reconstitute irradiated Mekk3+/+ nude mice before tumor injection. Our rationale was that Mekk3-deleted
(Mekk3Δflox/−) BM cells cannot participate in vasculogenesis,
yielding a model in which vasculogenesis is blocked in the
experimental group but angiogenesis in both the experiment
and control groups is equal. If vasculogenesis is critical, tumor
growth in the Mekk3Δflox/− BM–transplanted mice will be smaller
compared with tumors from Mekk3Δflox/+ BM–transplanted
mice. Here, we show that Mekk3Δflox/− BM cells do not participate
in tumor vessel formation and that tumor growth is significantly
impaired when vasculogenesis is inhibited.

Tie2-GFP-Mekk3+/− mice were set up for time mating to get
Tie2-GFP-Mekk3+/− or Tie2-GFP-Mekk3−/− day 9.5 embryos.
Mekk3 flox/+-Cre-ERTM -R26R mice. Rosa26R mice (14)
were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Mekk3flox/−
mice (15) were crossed with Rosa26R mice to generate
Mekk3flox/−/Rosa26R mice. Mekk3+/− mice were crossed with
Cre-ER mice to generate Cre-ER/Mekk3+/− mice. These mice
were then crossed with Mekk3flox/− Rosa26R mice to yield
Mekk3flox/+-Cre-ERTM-R26R and Mekk3flox/−Cre-ERTM-R26R
mice. Before BM transplantation, these mice were injected
i.p. with tamoxifen (2 mg) in 100 μL corn oil every 48 h for
14 d to delete the floxed-Mekk3 gene, generating Mekk3Δflox/+
and Mekk3Δflox/− mice. The Cre recombinase activation after
tamoxifen was monitored by lacZ expression resulting from
the deletion of a loxp-flanked DNA STOP sequence upstream
of the lacZ gene at the Rosa26 locus (14, 16).
Isolation of Mekk3+/−Tie2-GFP and Mekk3−/−Tie2-GFP
Endothelial Cells from E9.5-10.5 Embryos and Yolk Sacs
To obtain Tie2-GFP-Mekk3+/− and Tie2-GFP-Mekk3−/− embryos and yolk sacs, Tie2-GFP-Mekk3+/− female mice were set up for
time mating with Tie2-GFP-Mekk3+/− male mice (12). Vaginalplugged female mice were sacrificed on day 9.5-10.5. Embryos
and yolk sacs were dissected to remove decidu and Reichert's
membrane. A small piece of yolk sac was removed from each
embryo for immediate PCR genotyping. After PCR genotyping,
Tie2-GFP-Mekk3+/− and Tie2-GFP-Mekk3−/− yolk sacs were
minced into small pieces by repetitive pipetting before incubating with 1 mL of digestion cocktail containing 2 μg/mL collagenase A and 25 μg/mL DNase A (Sigma Chemical) in DMEM
(Invitrogen/Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 1 mmol/L sodium
pyruvate, 2× MEM vitamins, 1× nonessential amino acids,
and 2 mmol/L glutamine (Invitrogen/Life Technologies). The
cells were cultured for 1 wk. Endothelial cells and endothelial
precursor cells were isolated by sorting for GFP+ cells (17).
Vessel Formation Assay In vivo
GFP+ endothelial cells (5 × 105) isolated from Tie2-GFPMekk3+/− or Tie2-GFP-Mekk3−/− embryos and yolk sacs were
placed in 0.5 mL of Matrigel (BD Biosciences-Discovery Labware). This Matrigel was injected s.c. into nude mice. Mice
were sacrificed 4 wk later. Matrigel plugs were removed,
frozen, and analyzed by immunohistochemistry using rat
anti-mouse CD31 (BD Bioscience Pharmingen).
Western Blot Analysis
BM cells, heart, lung, kidney, and liver from the Mekk3Δflox/+
and Mekk3Δflox/− mice were homogenized in Triton X-100 lysis
buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and supernatants were harvested. The protein content of each lysate
was determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad Lab).
Tissue lysate (30 μg) was resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gels
were then electroblotted onto Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose
membranes (Amersham). Specific protein bands were detected with monoclonal mouse anti-Mekk3 antibody (BD
Transduction Laboratories). Protein loading was assessed
with the monoclonal β-actin antibody (Sigma Chemical)

using chemiluminescence and Western blotting analysis
(Amersham).
PCR Analysis for Mekk3 Genotypes
Genomic DNA from 7-day-old mice tails or BM from donor
and recipient mice were isolated and amplified by PCR. The
PCR primers used were as follows: P1 (5′-TCGCAGCGCATCGCCTTC-3′), P2 (5′-ATGTGAAGCTTGGGGATTTTG3′), P3 (5′-TGGTTAGACTCACTGGTCAGAGAC-3′), and
P4 (5′-TTGTGCATCGGGACATCA-3′). Primer combination P1, P2, and P3 yields amplified fragments of 1,000
bp (Mekk3 floxed), 900 bp (Mekk3 wild-type), and 830 bp
(Mekk3 knockout). Primer combination P3 and P4 yields
amplified fragments of 1,500 bp (Mekk3 floxed), 1,300 bp
(Mekk3 wild-type), and 650 bp (Mekk3 Δfloxed), which represents the deleted allele following tamoxifen treatment. Two
separate PCR assays are necessary because one assay cannot
detect all four alleles.
Matrigel Plug Assay
Mekk3Δflox/+ and Mekk3Δflox/− mice were injected s.c. at the
abdominal midline with 0.6 mL of Matrigel (BD BiosciencesDiscovery Labware). Tamoxifen (2 mg) was administered daily for 14 d. Mice were sacrificed, and the Matrigel plugs were
removed, frozen, fixed with acetone and chloroform, incubated in 4.5% fish gelatin (Aurion) for 20 min to block nonspecific protein, and then analyzed by immunohistochemistry.
Blood vessels were visualized by immunohistochemistry using rat anti-mouse CD31 as the primary antibody and goat
anti-rat Texas red (Jackson Immunoresearch Lab) as the secondary antibody. Hoechst 33342 (1:10,000 in PBS; Molecular
Probes) was used for nuclear staining. The mean vessel density (MVD) was determined by averaging the number of
CD31+ vessels in five random high-power microscopic fields
from different Matrigel sections.
Cell Lines and Lewis Lung Carcinoma 3LL Mouse
Tumor Model
TC71 and A4573 human Ewing's sarcoma cells and Lewis
lung carcinoma 3LL cells were cultured as previously described (6, 7, 18). 3LL cells (105 in 0.1 mL) were injected into
the right and left flanks in Mekk3Δflox/+ Cre-ER-R26R and
Mekk3Δflox/− Cre-ER-R26R mice from the same litter.
Ewing's Sarcoma Mouse Model and BM Transplantation
BM cells from the Mekk3flox/+ Cre-ER-R26R and Mekk3flox/−
Cre-ER-R26R mice are LacZ+. These mice were treated with
2 mg of tamoxifen every 48 h for 14 d to achieve deletion of
the floxed Mekk3. BM from Mekk3Δflox/+ and Mekk3Δflox/−
mice were obtained by flushing the femur and tibia with
PBS containing 5% fetal calf serum. Freshly isolated BM cells
(5 × 106 in 100 μL PBS) were injected into the lateral tail vein
of 6-wk-old female nude mice that had been irradiated with
8.0 Gy using an external cesium source (137Cs Mark 1 irradiator, J.L. Shepherd & Associates).
Four weeks after BM transplantation, mice were injected
s.c. with 2 × 106 TC71 or A4573 cells in 100 μL of PBS.
Mekk3Δflox/+ and Mekk3Δflox/− BM–transplanted mice were

injected with 2 mg of tamoxifen every 48 h to maintain deletion of floxed Mekk3, thereby maintaining the Mekk3Δflox/+
genotypes and Mekk3Δflox/− genotypes. Tumor diameter was
measured every other day with calipers. Tumor volumes were
calculated as v = 1/2ab2, in which a is the longer diameter and
b is the shorter diameter. The chimeric mice were euthanized
3 wk after tumor cell injection. Tumor tissue was analyzed by
immunohistochemistry.
Immunohistochemistry and LacZ Staining
Tumor specimens from Mekk3Δflox/+ and Mekk3Δflox/− BM–
transplanted mice were fixed and cryoprotected in sucrose
(35%) overnight, embedded in Tissue-Tek optimum cutting
temperature compound, and frozen. LacZ staining was done
(19–21). Immunohistochemistry using anti–PECAM-1/CD31
antibody (clone MEC13.3; Pharmingen) or anti-desmin (Abcam) on LacZ-stained tissues was performed followed by
counterstaining with nuclear fast red (17, 22). The MVD and
mural cell density was determined by averaging the number of
CD31 or desmin and LacZ double-positive cells in five random
high-power microscopic fields from different tumors.
Expression Plasmids and Transfection
siRNA expression vector pSilencer2.1-U6 hygro was purchased from Ambion. siRNA-expressing plasmids targeting
human Mekk3 mRNA GTGCAGAAAATTCCTTGTC (23) were
annealed at 90°C for 3 min, cooled to 37°C, and incubated
for 1 h. The annealed dsDNA oligonucleotides were ligated
between BamHI and HindIII sites on the pSilencer2.1-U6
hygro vector. The control vector (si-) was constructed by

inserting a sequence that expresses an siRNA with limited homology to sequences in the human and mouse genomes.
Transfection of TC71 cells was performed with Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen/Life Technologies). Transfected clones were
selected in 400 μg/mL hygromycin B (Invitrogen/Life Technologies). Human Mekk3 expression in the stable clones was
quantified by Western blot.
In vivo Experiments Using TC71/Mekk3 si-transfected
Clones
TC71, TC71/si-control, TC71/Mekk3 si-clone 8, or TC71/
Mekk3 si-clone 10 cells (2 × 10 6 ) were injected s.c. into
four groups of nude mice. Tumor growth was quantified every other day. All the tumors were harvested on day 27
and frozen sections were stained using rat anti-mouse
CD31 (primary antibody) and goat anti-rat Texas red (secondary antibody). Hoechst 33342 (1:10,000 in PBS) was
used for nuclear staining. The MVD was determined by averaging the number of CD31+ cells in five random high-power
microscopic fields. Apoptotic cells were quantified using
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick
end labeling.

typical round vessels (Fig. 1A), whereas Mekk3−/− endothelial
cells failed to form vessel structures (Fig. 1B).
Because deletion of Mekk3 is embryonically lethal (12), we
elected to use tamoxifen-dependent, Cre-mediated Mekk3 deletion in Mekk3flox/− Cre-ER-R26R mice to obtain Mekk3deleted (Mekk3Δflox/−) BM cells. Mekk3Δflox/+ BM cells from
tamoxifen-treated Mekk3flox/+ Cre-ER-R26R mice were used
as the control. To confirm Mekk3 deletion, mice were sacrificed 2 weeks after tamoxifen treatment. Western blotting
showed no Mekk3 in BM cells, heart (Fig. 2A), lung, kidney,
and liver (data not shown) from the Mekk3Δflox/− mice. By
contrast, MEKK3 was present in the cells and organs taken
from the Mekk3Δflox/+ mice.
Having confirmed that we can successfully create
Mekk3Δflox/− mice with no cellular expression of MEKK3, we
next evaluated whether new blood vessel formation could be
induced. Anti-CD31 staining was assessed 2 weeks after Matrigel implantation. Matrigel plugs excised from Mekk3Δflox/−
mice showed a significant decrease in vessel density compared with those from Mekk3Δflox/+ control mice (Fig. 2B).
These data confirm that the ability of endothelial cells to

form vessels is impaired following deletion of Mekk3.
To confirm that tumor vessel formation was also impaired
in mice in which Mekk3 was deleted, we injected 3LL lung
cancer cells into Mekk3 Δflox/− and Mekk3 Δflox/+ control
mice. Rapid tumor growth was seen in the Mekk3Δflox/+ control mice. By contrast, no tumor growth was seen in the
Mekk3Δflox/− mice, confirming that this gene is also critical
for tumor vessel formation (Fig. 2C). This Mekk3 Δflox/−
mouse model, however, could not be used to assess the importance of vasculogenesis in tumor vessel development
because both angiogenesis and vasculogenesis are inhibited.
Furthermore, no assessment could be performed with regard
to Ewing's sarcoma, as human tumor cells will not grow in
immunocompetent mice.
Deletion of Mekk3 in BM cells inhibits vasculogenesis
and tumor growth. We showed that Mekk3-deficient cells
do not form blood vessels and that Mekk3-deficient mice
do not support tumor growth. We next used our previously
described Ewing's sarcoma transplant model (6) to selectively inhibit vasculogenesis to determine the importance of BM
cells in the formation of tumor blood vessels. Recipient nude

Figure 3. Confirmation of engraftment 4 wk after transplant. LacZ+ Mekk3Δflox/+ or LacZ+ Mekk3Δflox/− BM cells were injected into lethally irradiated nude
mice. To confirm engraftment, BM cells from the Mekk3Δflox/+ and Mekk3Δflox/− BM–transplanted mice were obtained 4 wk following transplantation and
analyzed by Western blot (A) and genotyping (B and C). B, PCR primers P1, P2, and P3 were used to detect the floxed Mekk3 allele (flox, 1,000 bp), wild-type
Mekk3 allele (wt, 900 bp), and Mekk3 germline knockout allele (KO, 830 bp). C, primers P3 and P4 were used to detect wild-type (1,300 pb), floxed
(1,500 bp), and the loxp-deleted Mekk3 allele (Δflox, 650 bp). Primer design necessitates using two separate PCR reactions to confirm the presence of the
Mekk3 Δflox allele, which represents the deleted Mekk3 allele following tamoxifen treatment. Floxed allele is equivalent to the wild-type allele and the
Δflox allele is equivalent to the knockout allele.

mice were lethally irradiated and then transplanted with BM
cells from either the Mekk3Δflox/+ or Mekk3Δflox/− mice. The
absence of Mekk3 in the Mekk3Δflox/− BM cells was confirmed
as described in Fig. 2A before transplant. Mekk3Δflox/+ BM
cells were positive for Mekk3 and served as the control transplant cells. Engraftment was confirmed 4 weeks after transplant by demonstrating the absence of Mekk3 in the BM cells
of the Mekk3Δflox/− BM–transplanted mice (Fig. 3). Mice were
then injected with TC71 or A4573 cells, and tumor growth
was monitored. Because nude mice are Mekk3+/+, the local
endothelial cells can participate in vascular expansion. However, because the Mekk3Δflox/− BM cells lack Mekk3, their ability to contribute to tumor vessel formation (vasculogenesis) is
impaired. This experimental design results in selective inhibition of vasculogenesis. Both TC71 and A4573 tumor growth
were impaired in the Mekk3Δflox/− BM–transplanted mice
compared with the mice transplanted with Mekk3 Δflox/+
BM cells (Fig. 4A and C). The tumors from the Mekk3Δflox/−
BM–transplanted mice remained small and stable over 17 to
21 days, and seemed to be less vascular in addition to being
smaller (Fig. 4B and D).
Because the BM cells from the donor mice were LacZ+, βgal staining was used to distinguish cells of donor origin from
cells of the host. Colocalization of LacZ and CD31 on tumor
vessels was seen in tumors excised from the Mekk3Δflox/+
BM–transplanted mice (Fig. 5A). Whereas Lac Z+ cells were vi-

1338

sualized within the tumor in the Mekk3Δflox/− BM–transplanted
mice, very few of these cells colocalized with the CD31+ cells
(Fig. 5A). Quantification of double-positive LacZ and CD31 cells
confirmed that BM cell contribution to tumor vessel formation
was impaired following deletion of Mekk3 (Fig. 5A). These data
indicate that whereas the Mekk3-deficient BM cells were able
to migrate to the tumor area, their contribution to tumor vessel
formation was minimal.
To confirm that angiogenesis was at a similar level in
Mekk3Δflox/+ and Mekk3Δflox/− BM–transplanted mice, we
quantified the number CD31+/LacZ− vessels in the tumors.
CD31+/LacZ− represent tumor vessels with no BM-derived
cells and thus can be used as a way to quantify local angiogenesis.
There was no difference in the number of CD31+/LacZ− vessels
(Fig. 5B). These data indicate that the angiogenesis process
was similar in the two groups, confirming that the inhibition
in tumor growth was secondary to the defect in vasculogenesis.
Deletion of Mekk3 inhibits the contribution of BMderived mural cells/pericytes to Ewing's sarcoma vasculature. Interaction between endothelial cells and mural cells/
pericytes plays an important role in vascular formation (24).
We showed that BM-derived mural cells/pericytes contribute
to Ewing's sarcoma vessel development (7, 25). Tumors were
therefore analyzed by immunohistochemistry for the presence of BM-derived mural cells/pericytes. Colocalization of

cells/pericytes in tumor vessels and assess whether deleting
Mekk3 affected the ability of BM-derived mural cells/
pericytes to contribute to the tumor vascular structure

tumors from control Mekk3Δflox/+ BM–transplanted mice
(Fig. 5C) confirmed our previous findings that BM-derived

mural cells/pericytes contribute to tumor vessel formation
(7, 25). Deletion of Mekk3 inhibited this process. Very few

Effect of downregulating Mekk3 in TC71 cells on tumor
growth and tumor vessel formation. We have shown that
deletion of Mekk3 in BM cells impairs their ability to participate in tumor vessel expansion, resulting in decreased tumor vascular density and mural cells/pericytes coverage.
To determine whether tumor cell expression of Mekk3 is required for tumor-induced vessel expansion, Mekk3 in TC71
cells was knocked down using siRNA. Two stable clones
were isolated (TC71 clone 8 and TC71 clone 10; Fig. 6A).

The downregulation of Mekk3 in the TC71 cells had no effect
on the ability of these cells to form tumors or stimulate
neovascularization. Tumor growth and MVD were similar
to the control-transfected cells (Fig. 6B and C). Tumors were
harvested on day 25 to confirm that the Mekk3 downregulation had been maintained (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
Tumor vessels are formed through at least two different

BM Cells Are Critical for Tumor Vessel Expansion

proliferation from the preexisting vasculature, and vasculogenesis (2, 3, 27), defined as the recruitment of BM-derived
precursors into the tumor area with subsequent differentiation into endothelial cells. The contribution of vasculogenesis
varies considerably depending on the tumor type. We have
shown that vasculogenesis, in addition to angiogenesis, contributes to the expansion of the Ewing's tumor vascular network
with 10% of the vessels containing BM-derived as opposed to
locally derived cells (6, 7, 28). Using a transplant mouse model
with GFP+ BM cells, we showed that both locally derived and
BM-derived cells make up the tumor vessel wall and the surrounding pericyte population (7, 28). Our previous studies (6,
7, 28) support the concept that BM cells contribute to the endothelial and peri-endothelial components that form the Ewing's tumor vasculature. Inhibiting BM cell chemotaxis into
the tumor area resulted in the formation of significantly smaller and less vascular tumors (28). Furthermore, stimulating the
migration of BM cells into vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF)–inhibited Ewing's tumors in vivo enhanced the neovasculature development and rescued tumor growth (29). Taken together, these data indicated that the vasculogenesis
process is vital in the formation of tumor vessels.
Recent studies have questioned the importance of vasculogenesis to tumor development and growth (20). Proving

that vasculogenesis is a critical process in tumor vessel expansion requires a model in which angiogenesis is intact
but vasculogenesis is impaired. In the study presented here,
we elected to take advantage of the recent finding that the
Mekk3 gene is required for blood vessel development (12).
We first confirmed that Mekk3−/− cells failed to form vessels.
Next, we transplanted Mekk3Δflox/− BM cells into lethally irradiated nude mice, thereby creating a mouse that had
Mekk3+/+ cells in the peripheral organs (cells that could participate in angiogenesis) and Mekk3Δflox/− cells in the BM
(cells that could not participate in vasculogenesis). The absence of Mekk3 did not affect engraftment. Mice survived
the irradiation procedure and engraftment was confirmed
4 weeks after transplant. BM cells from the Mekk3Δflox/−
BM–transplanted mice were negative for Mekk3, as assessed
by both genotyping and Western blot (Fig. 3). Mice transplanted with Mekk3Δflox/+ BM cells were positive for Mekk3
and served as the controls. Tumor growth was significantly
impaired in the Mekk3Δflox/− BM–transplanted mice (Fig. 4).
Although tamoxifen was used to generate and maintain
the Mekk3Δflox/− status in the BM cells, tamoxifen treatment played no role in this tumor suppression as both the
Mekk3Δflox/− and Mekk3Δflox/+ BM–transplanted mice received identical tamoxifen treatment. The tumors from the

Figure 6. Downregulation of Mekk3 in TC71 cells did not affect tumor growth or tumor vessel formation. TC71 cells were transfected with Mekk3 siRNA. Several
clones were isolated following transfection. A, downregulation of Mekk3 was confirmed by Western blot in clone 8 and clone 10. B, mice were injected
with TC71, TC71 control siRNA transfected (si-control), clone 8, or clone 10 cells. Tumor growth was monitored for 4 wk. C, tumors were excised on
day 25 and analyzed by immumohistochemistry using CD31 staining. The average number of vessels was quantified by counting five random high-power
microscopic fields from different tumor sections. Error bars represent SD. D, excised tumors were also analyzed by Western blot for Mekk3 expression.

Mekk3Δflox/− BM–transplanted mice remained small for over
2 weeks (Fig. 4A and C). These tumors were less vascular
with a significant decrease in MVD and pericyte coverage (Fig. 5). Chemotaxis of the Mekk3Δflox/− BM cells into
the tumor area was not impaired. The Mekk3 Δflox/− and
Mekk3Δflox/+ cells were LacZ+, allowing us to identify BMderived cells in the tumor tissue using β-gal staining. Tumor
sections from the BM-transplanted mice showed LacZ+ cells
with significant numbers of LacZ+/CD31+ double-positive
cells, indicating that BM cells were migrating into the tumor
area, differentiating into endothelial cells, and participating
in tumor vessel formation. Whereas LacZ + cells were
also identified in tumor sections from the Mekk3 Δflox/−
BM–transplanted mice, the number of LacZ+/CD31+ double-positive cells was significantly diminished (Fig. 5). These
data suggest that the Mekk3Δflox/− BM cells were able to
migrate to the tumor but unable to participate in vessel formation. This resulted in few BM-derived tumor vessels, confirming the selective inhibition of vasculogenesis. The vessels
that were present were derived from the host cells in the
surrounding tumor area as they were LacZ−. Our data show
for the first time that selectively inhibiting vasculogenesis
severely compromised tumor growth.
The transplant model used to selectively inhibit BM cell
participation in tumor vessel formation required wholebody irradiation. Radiation has been shown to inhibit
local angiogenesis to some degree (30). Although we
cannot exclude the fact that the level of angiogenesis may
have been decreased in the mice after radiation, the level
of angiogenesis was the same in the Mekk3 Δflox/+ and
Mekk3Δflox/− BM–transplanted mice. Therefore, radiation
effect cannot explain the decreased tumor growth rate seen.
We confirmed this by quantifying the number of tumor
vessels that contained no BM-derived cells. This was
done by identifying the CD31+/LacZ− tumor vessels. Both
the Mekk3Δflox/+ and Mekk3Δflox/− BM cells were LacZ+.
Therefore, a vessel that contained no LacZ + cells was
derived by the local endothelial cells or angiogenesis. Vasculogenesis contributed to the LacZ+ vessels. The number
of CD31+/LacZ− vessels was not significantly different in
the Mekk3Δflox/+ and Mekk3Δflox/− BM–transplanted mice
(P > 0.05). These data confirmed that the decreased tumor
growth rate seen in the Mekk3Δflox/−–transplanted mice using both the TC71 and A4573 models was a direct effect of
defective vasculogenesis and the inability of BM cells to
participate in tumor vessel formation. Although our model
may favor vasculogenesis, this does not lessen the importance of our finding. Exponential tumor growth was seen
in the irradiated mice transplanted with Mekk3Δflox/+ BM
cells that can participate in vasculogenesis, whereas the
tumors in the Mekk3Δflox/−–transplanted mice remained
unchanged in size (Fig. 4). If anything, this shows that
vasculogenesis may provide a mechanism for tumor cells
to circumvent the negative effect of radiation on angiogenesis, thereby rescuing tumor growth.
Our studies indicate that tumor vessel expansion and tumor growth are compromised when BM cells are unable to
participate in tumor vascular formation. Altering Mekk3 ex-

pression in the TC71 tumor cells had no effect on tumor
growth. This is not surprising because altering the status of
Mekk3 in tumor cells does not affect VEGF production or the
ability of cells in the microenvironment to form vessel (31).
Both the local endothelial cells and the BM cells in this model are Mekk3+/+ and can therefore participate in tumor vessel
formation. These data indicate that the status of Mekk3 in
the tumor cell itself is of no consequence to the development
of the tumor vasculature.
Others have shown that the growth of Mekk3 deficient tumor-like embryonic stem cells was similar to Mekk3+/+ embryonic stem cells (31). MVD was also not affected. This
supports our findings that the status of Mekk3 in tumor cells
does not affect tumor-induced vessel formation. However,
this study did not examine whether Mekk3 deletion in the
microenvironment affected tumor growth or tumor vessel
formation. Our current study examined both.
In summary, we have shown that MEKK3 plays a key role
in the ability of BM stem cells to participate in the formation
of tumor vessels, which subsequently significantly affect tumor growth. We also showed that MEKK3 may control
critical signaling pathways that are involved in pericyte differentiation and interaction with the vascular endothelium.
Finally, we showed for the first time that vasculogenesis
and BM cells not only contribute to, but play a critical role
in, the development and the expansion of the tumor vascular
network that supports the growth of Ewing's tumors. The importance of BM-derived vasculogenesis has also been shown
in other tumor models (32, 33). Inhibiting this process suppresses the ability of Ewing's sarcoma cells to grow. These
are important new findings particularly for Ewing's sarcoma,
as cure rates have remained stagnant for >20 years. In addition, the long-term effects associated with intensive chemotherapy and radiation underscores the need for more
targeted approaches. Targeting the vasculogenesis process
may therefore offer novel therapeutic opportunities.
