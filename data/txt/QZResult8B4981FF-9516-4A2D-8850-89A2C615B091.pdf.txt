Abstract
S-phase kinase protein 2 (SKP2), an F-box protein, targets cell
cycle regulators including cycle-dependent kinase inhibitor
p27Kip1 via ubiquitin-mediated degradation. SKP2 is frequently overexpressed in a variety of cancers. We investigated
the role of SKP2 and its ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in
colorectal carcinoma using a panel of cell lines, clinical
samples, and the NUDE mouse model. Using immunohistochemical analysis on a large tissue microarray of 448 samples,
an inverse association of SKP2 expression with p27Kip1
protein levels was seen. A colorectal cancer (CRC) subset with
high level of SKP2 and low level of p27Kip1 showed a
decreased overall survival (P = 0.0057). Treatment of CRC cell
lines with bortezomib or expression of small interfering RNA
of SKP2 causes down-regulation of SKP2 and accumulation of
p27Kip1. Furthermore, treatment of CRC cells with bortezomib causes apoptosis by involving the mitochondrial pathway
and activation of caspases. In addition, treatment of CRC cells
with bortezomib down-regulated the expression of XIAP,
cIAP1, and survivin. Finally, treatment of CRC cell line
xenografts with bortezomib resulted in growth inhibition of
tumors in NUDE mice via down-regulation of SKP2 and
accumulation of p27Kip1. Altogether, our results suggest that
SKP2 and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway may be potential
targets for therapeutic intervention for treatment of CRC.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is still a cause of high morbidity and
mortality rates. Significant improvements have been made in the
management of this disease mainly through the introduction of
adjuvant chemotherapy agents like flurouracil and oxaliplatin (1).
More recently, advances in the understanding of tumor biology
have led to the development of targeted therapies (2), allowing
progress in the treatment of CRC (3).
The proteasome is an intracellular multicatalytic complex, which
together with the two regulators, PA28 (also called proteasome 11S)
and PA700 (also called proteasome 19S), forms the 26S proteasome
(4, 5). This constitutes the ubiquitin-proteasome system and

regulates a number of intracellular proteins that govern cell cycle
tumor, growth, and survival by degrading a number of different
polypeptides important for cell cycle progression and apoptosis
(6–8). The main rate-limiting regulator for p27Kip1 degradation
has been recently identified as an SCF-type ubiquitin ligase
complex that contains S-phase kinase protein 2 (SKP2) as the
specific substrate recognition subunit (9–11). SKP2 specifically
binds p27Kip1 and targets it for degradation by the ubiquitin
proteolytic system. Recently, it has been shown that overexpression
of SKP2 in mantle cell lymphoma decreased the p27Kip1
expression level, whereas inhibition of SKP2 by small interfering
RNA (siRNA) increased p27Kip1 and p21waf1 levels (9–12). The
important role of SKP2 in controlling p27Kip1 levels have been
reported in a number of human cancer, including colorectal, breast,
prostate, and oral squamous cell carcinomas (13–15).
The main mechanism of action of antineoplastic agents is their
ability to induce apoptosis. Evidence is mounting to indicate that
proteasome inhibitors, such as the peptide aldehyde PSI, selectively
inhibit the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome and
suppress the proliferation of human cancer cells by causing
apoptosis and/or cell cycle arrest (16–19). The proteasome
inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade) has been approved by the Food
and Drug Administration for the treatment of multiple myeloma
and mantle cell lymphoma patients who had received at least one
prior therapy and many clinical trials are ongoing to examine the
efficacy of bortezomib for the treatment of other malignancies (20).
In this study, we first show, using immunohistochemical analysis
on a large tissue microarray of 448 samples, that low expression of
p27Kip1 and high expression of SKP2 can identify a clinically
aggressive subgroup of CRC. We then show that bortezomib
treatment of CRC cell lines can interfere with SKP2-mediated
p27Kip1 turnover by stabilizing or up-regulating the expression of
p27Kip1 and increase the degradation of SKP2 protein in vitro and
in vivo . Furthermore, CRC cells treated with this specific
proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, show cell growth arrest and
apoptosis via activation of the caspase cascade and disruption of
the mitochondrial equilibrium. Finally, our data show that the
growth of CRC cell line xenografts is inhibited by bortezomib
treatment due to down-regulation of SKP-2 and up-regulation of
p27Kip1. Altogether, these results suggest that proteasome
inhibitors may have a great utility in the treatment of CRC.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. CRC cell lines Colo320, HCT15, and SW480 cells
were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine
serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 units/mL streptomycin at 37jC in
humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. All experiments were performed
in RPMI 1640 containing 5% serum.

Reagents and antibodies. Bortezomib (Velcade) was a gift from
Millenium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. MG132 was purchased from Calbiochem.
Antibodies against cleaved caspase-3 and BID antibodies were purchased
from Cell Signaling Technologies. Cytochrome c, h-actin, caspase-3 and
poly(ADP)ribose polymerase (PARP) antibodies were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. XIAP, cIAP1, and caspase-8 antibodies were
purchased from R&D. Annexin V was purchased from Molecular Probes.
Apoptotic DNA-ladder kit was obtained from Roche.
In vivo tumor xenograft studies. Six-week-old NUDE mice were
obtained from The Jackson Laboratory and maintained in a pathogen-free
animal facility at least 1 wk before use. All animal studies were done in
accordance with institutional guidelines. For xenograft study, mice were
inoculated s.c. into the right abdominal quadrant with 5 million Colo320
cells in 200 AL PBS. After 1 wk, mice were randomly assigned into two
groups receiving either bortezomib or 0.9% saline. Treatment with
bortezomib (1 mg/kg) was given i.p. twice weekly. The control group
received the vehicle alone at the same schedule. The body weight of each
mouse was monitored weekly and tumor volume was measured as
described previously (21). After 4 wk of treatment, mice were sacrificed
and individual tumors are weighed then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for
storage.
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
assays. Cells (104) were incubated in triplicate in a 96-well plate in the
presence or absence of indicated test doses of bortezomib in a final volume
of 0.20 mL for 24 h. The ability of bortezomib to suppress cell growth was
determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) cell proliferation assays, as previously described (22). Replicates of
three wells for each dosage, including vehicle control, were analyzed for
each experiment.
DNA laddering. DNA laddering assay was performed as described earlier
(23). Briefly, cells (2  106) were treated with and without bortezomib for
24 h. The cells were then harvested and resuspended in 200 AL 1 PBS.
Then, 200 AL lysis buffer containing 6 mol/L guanidine HCl, 10 mmol/L
urea, 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, and 20% Triton X (v/v; pH 4.4), were added to the
cells and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Isopropanol (100 AL)
was added and shaken for 30 s on a vortex. Then, samples were passed
through a filter and spun at 4,500  g for 1 min, and the supernatant
was discarded. The pellets were washed thrice with wash buffer containing
20 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L Tris-HCl, and 80% ethanol. The pellets were
then transferred into a new 1.5-mL tube and eluted with 200 AL prewarmed
elution buffer. After measuring the DNA, 2 Ag DNA were electrophoresed on
a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide at 75 V for 2 h and
visualized using a UV light source.
Annexin V/propidium iodide dual staining. Colorectal carcinoma
cell lines were treated with the indicated concentrations of bortezomib.
The cells were harvested and the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis
was measured by flow cytometry after staining with fluorescein-conjugated
Annexin V and propidium iodide (Molecular Probes) as previously described (23).
Gene silencing using siRNA. SKP2 siRNA and scrambled control siRNA
were purchased from Qiagen. For transient expression, cell lines were
transfected by using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. After incubating the cells for 6 h, the lipid
and siRNA complex was removed and fresh growth medium was added.
Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection and specific protein levels were
determined by Western blot analysis with specific antibodies against the
targeted proteins and actin as a loading control.
Cell lysis and immunoblotting. Cells were treated with proteasome
inhibitor as described in the legends and lysed as previously described (24).
Proteins (15–20 Ag) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Immobilon, Millipore).
Immunoblotting was done with different antibodies and visualized by the
enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham) method.
Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential. Cells were
treated with bortezomib for 48 h, washed twice with PBS, and suspended in
mitochondrial incubation buffer. JC1 was added to a final concentration of
10 Amol/L and cells were incubated at 37jC in dark for 15 min. Cells were

then washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 500 AL of mitochondrial
incubation buffer and mitochondrial membrane potential (% of green
and red aggregates) was determined by flow cytometry as described previously (25).
Assays for cytochrome c release. The release of cytochrome c from the
mitochondria was assayed as described earlier (25). Briefly, cells were
treated with and without proteasome inhibitor as described in figure
legends, harvested, and resuspended in hypotonic buffer. Cells were
homogenized, and cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were isolated by
differential centrifugation. Twenty to 25 Ag of protein from cytosolic and
mitochondrial fractions of each sample were analyzed by immunoblotting
using an anti–cytochrome c antibody.
Patient selection and tissue microarray construction. Four hundred
forty-eight patients with CRC diagnosed between 1990 and 2006 were
selected from King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center. All
samples were analyzed in a tissue microarray format. Tissue microarray
construction was performed as described earlier (26). Briefly, tissue
cylinders with a diameter of 0.6 mm were punched from representative
tumor regions of each donor tissue block and brought into recipient
paraffin block using a homemade semiautomatic robotic precision
instrument. An overview of CRC tissue microarray section is shown in
Fig. 1B. Three 0.6-mm cores of CRC were arrayed from each case. Clinical
and histologic data were available for all these patients. The Colorectal Unit,
Department of Surgery, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center
provided long-term follow-up data for these patients. The institutional
review board of the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center
approved the study.
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical studies on formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were performed as described in
earlier studies (27). Tissue microarray slides were processed and stained
manually. The streptavidin-biotin peroxidase technique with diaminobenzidine as chromogen was applied. For antigen retrieval, Dako Target
Retrieval Solution (pH 9.0) was used, and the slides were microwaved at 750
W for 5 min and then at 250 W for 30 min. The sections were incubated
overnight with SKP2 (monoclonal clone 1G12E9, 1:100; Invitrogen), p27Kip1
(monoclonal clone 57, 1:300; Invitrogen), and Ki-67 (monoclonal, clone
MIB1, 1:50; Dako), and the Dako Envision Plus System kit was used as the
secondary detection system with 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine as chromogen. All
slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, cleared, and
coverslipped with Permount. Grading of nuclear protein staining was based
on proportion or percentage of cell nuclei staining and was semiquantified
as high or low. Nuclear protein expression of epithelial cells only was scored
as high if 50% or more of the nuclei were stained or low if <50% were
stained, as has been reported previously (28). Intensity of staining can vary
between cases due to different tissue preservation, and, therefore, was not
included as a variable in the final scoring.
Statistics. The software used for statistical analysis was Statview 5.0 (SAS
Institute, Inc.). The correlation of coefficients between pairs of variables was
performed using Pearson’s correlation. Survival curves were constructed by
the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate analysis by Cox regression;
P values <0.05 were considered significant. Two-sided tests were used
throughout the analyses.

Results
Overexpression of proteasomal protein SKP2 is inversely
associated with p27Kip1 in CRC. Levels of SKP2 and p27Kip1
were examined by immunohistochemistry in a series of 448
colorectal adenocarcinomas. A typical case, shown in Fig. 1A,
illustrates the decrease in nuclear staining of p27Kip1, increased
levels of SKP2 and Ki-67 in tumor sample compared with low SKP2,
and Ki-67 and high p27Kip1 expression in another CRC tumor
sample. Loss of p27Kip1 expression was seen in 61.8% (243 of 393)
and SKP2 overexpression was seen in 27.6% (112 of 406) of the CRC
cases. Representative information was available in 393 of 448 spots
for p27Kip1 and 406 of 448 spots for SKP2 expression. Expression of

analyzed by stratifying the patients in two groups: normal SKP2/normal p27 group versus Skp2 overexpression and low p27Kip1 expression. n, number of patients.

SKP2 protein was inversely related to p27Kip1 levels (P < 0.0001),
similar to previous findings (28). SKP2 and p27Kip1 expressions
were not associated with patients’ age or gender. In addition,
neither SKP2 nor p27Kip1 expression was associated with disease
stage at presentation. Thus, the expression of these proteins was
not significantly different between early disease (stages I and II)
and advanced disease (stages III and IV). We further stratified all
our CRC cases into two groups depending on the presence of SKP2
expression and p27Kip1 expression status: normal SKP2/normal
p27Kip1 group (n = 137) and CRC with SKP2 overexpression and
low p27Kip1 expression (n = 93). The clinicopathologic and the
immunohistochemical analyses of the above subset of patients are
summarized in Table 1. Such stratification showed significant

group with nodal metastasis (P = 0.0147) and overexpression of
proliferative marker Ki-67 (P < 0.0001). Poorly differentiated tumors
showed a trend toward higher SKP2 and low p27Kip1 levels
compared with well-differentiated tumors (P = 0.0625). Furthermore, such stratification showed a significant correlation with
overall survival (P = 0.0057) and remained significant even in
multivariate analysis that included American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) stage and the above-mentioned two groups (Fig. 1C).
The relative risk for death was 2.4 for the CRC group with SKP2
overexpression and loss of p27Kip1 expression (95% confidence
interval, 1.3-5.1; P = 0.0029) and 2.5 for AJCC stage group III and IV
(95% confidence interval, 1.3-6.4, P = 0.0040).

Proteasomal inhibition induces G2-M cell cycle arrest and
caspase-mediated apoptosis in CRC cell lines. We used a panel
of CRC cell lines to determine whether inhibition of proteasome
pathways by specific inhibitor leads to growth inhibition of these
cancer cell lines. CRC cells were treated with various doses of
bortezomib for 48 hours and cell proliferation was determined by
MTT assays. As shown in Fig. 2A, bortezomib caused a dosedependent growth inhibition in all the cell lines.
To test whether the reduced growth of CRC cell lines by
proteasome inhibition is associated with cell cycle dysregulation,
Colo320 cells were treated with various doses of bortezomib and
the cell cycle status was analyzed by flow cytometry after staining
with propidium iodide. As shown in Fig. 2B, after 24 hours of
treatment with bortezomib, the percentage of cells in the G0-G1
phase was reduced to >50% compared with control, with the
treated cells accumulating in the G2-M phase, suggesting that
proteasome inhibition induces cell cycle arrest rather than
apoptosis after 24 hours of treatment. To confirm these findings,

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

we analyzed cells after 24-hour treatment with bortezomib with
Annexin V/propidium iodide dual staining and we were not able to
detect appreciable amount of apoptosis when compared with the
untreated control sample (data not shown). However, after
48 hours of treatment with different doses of bortezomib, we
detected a shift of cells to the sub-G1 phase compared with the
control sample. The sub-G1 population of cells increased from
1.52% in the untreated control sample to 26.99% after 50 nmol/L
treatment, 26.43% after 100 nmol/L treatment, and 29.36% after
500 nmol/L treatment in Colo320 cells. This increase in the sub-G1
population was accompanied by a dose-dependent decrease in the
percentage of cells in the G2-M phase. It has been reported that
cells with these features are dying of apoptosis (22, 23).
To further confirm that this increase in the sub-G1 is indeed
apoptosis, CRC cell lines were treated with various doses of
bortezomib for 48 hours and the cells were stained with FITCconjugated Annexin V and propidium iodide to assess apoptosis
and IC50 of CRC cell lines were obtained (Supplementary Fig. S1).

SKP2 and Colorectal Carcinoma

As shown in Fig. 2C, there was a dose-dependent increase in the
apoptotic cells in the Colo320 cell line as seen by an increase of
cells in the upper right quadrant depicting apoptotic cells. The
same data were obtained for other cell lines after 48 hours of
treatment (HCT-15 and SW-480). One additional method, which is
the hallmark of apoptosis, DNA laddering after 48 hours of
treatment with various doses of bortezomib, as shown in Fig. 2D,
confirmed that the cells are actually dying of apoptosis.
Progression through the phases of cell cycle is regulated by
periodic activation of several cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK)
whose levels are controlled through ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (29–31). In particular, levels of CDK inhibitors
(CDKI) p27Kip1 have been previously shown to be dysregulated
following proteasomal inhibition (32–35). There are a number of
studies that show SKP2 playing an essential role in degradation of
p27Kip1 (9–11). In view of these findings, we sought to determine
whether bortezomib-induced apoptosis is due to degradation of

SKP2. CRC cell lines were treated with 100 and 500 nmol/L
bortezomib for 48 hours. Cells were lysed and proteins were
separated on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with SKP2. As shown
in Fig. 3A, bortezomib treatment caused down-regulation of SKP2
in all three cell lines and up-regulation of p27Kip1. LOVO and HCT116 CRC cell line (Supplementary Fig. S2) showed similar response
after bortezomib treatment. A strong inverse relation was found
between SKP2 and p27Kip1 after bortezomib treatment. Similar
results were obtained with MG132, another inhibitor of proteasome. Bortezomib treatment of DLD-1 CRC cell line failed to
induce apoptosis, and no effect was seen on the expression of SKP2
and p27kip1 (Supplementary Fig. S2), suggesting that bortezomibmediated down-regulation of SKP2 is an important mechanism to
induce apoptosis in CRC cell line via up-regulation of p27Kip1. To
provide direct evidence whether down-regulation of SKP2 upregulates p27Kip1, we attempted to inhibit SKP2 expression in
Colo320 and HCT-15 cells by the siRNA strategy. For this purpose,

cytometry as described in Materials and Methods. C, bortezomib-induced apoptosis detected by Annexin V/propidium iodide dual staining. Colo320, HCT-15,

propidium iodide. D, Colo320 cells were treated with bortezomib as indicated for 48 h, and DNA was extracted and separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gel.

treatment down-regulated expression of SKP2 and increased level of p27Kip1. Colo320, HCT-15, and SW-480 cells were treated with and without 100 and 500 nmol/L

were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon membrane, and immunoblotted with antibodies against SKP2, p27Kip1, and h actin as indicated. B, SKP2
siRNA expression down-regulates SKP2 and accumulated p27Kip1. Colo320 and HCT-15 cells were transfected with scrambled siRNA (100 nmol/L) and SKP2
siRNA (50 and 100 nmol/L) with Lipofectamine as described in Materials and Methods. After 48 h of transfection, cells were lysed and equal amounts of proteins were
separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon membrane, and immunoblotted with antibodies against SKP2, P27Kip1, and h actin as indicated.

SKP2 activity was blocked by expression using siRNA against SKP2.
As expected in Fig. 3B, transfection of siRNA against SKP2 resulted
in SKP2 protein depletion as well as concomitant accumulation of
p27Kip1 in colon cell lines. Finally, when CRC cells were treated
with lower doses of bortezomib (25 and 50 nmol/L) in combination
with 0.1 and 0.5 Amol/L 5-fluorouracil, it induced an appreciable
amount of apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B) and caused
down-regulation of SKP-2 leading to accumulation of p27kip1 (data
not shown). These results suggest that proteasome inhibition in
CRC cell lines stabilized p27Kip1 via down-regulation of SKP2.
The apoptotic signaling cascade starts with activation of
caspase-8 and truncation of BID that translocates to the
mitochondrial membrane, allowing activation of proapoptotic
proteins and release of cytochrome c. Therefore, we sought to
determine whether down-regulation of SKP2 signaling involves the
mitochondria. Activated caspase-8 is capable of cleaving caspase-3
either directly or by digesting BID to its active form (tBID), which
leads to the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria.
Bortezomib treatment resulted in activation of caspase-8 leading to
truncation of BID in Colo320 and SW-480 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S4A) as inferred by the decreased intensity of the full-length
BID band. We then tested the effect of bortezomib on the

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

mitochondrial membrane potentials in these cells. Cells were
treated with bortezomib for 48 hours and labeled with JC1 dye and
the mitochondrial membrane potential was measured by flow
cytometry. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S4B, inhibition of
proteasome resulted in loss of mitochondrial membrane potential
in CRC cells as measured by JC1 stained green fluorescence
depicting apoptotic cells. We then studied cytochrome c release
from the mitochondria in cells treated for 48 hours with
bortezomib. Cytochrome c was released to the cytosol after
bortezomib treatment in Colo320 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
On the other hand, the level of cytochrome c decreased in
mitochondrial fraction of Colo320 cells. These results suggest that
inhibition of proteasome pathways disrupts the mitochondrial
membrane potential leading to the release of cytochrome c to the
cytosol. We then sought to determine whether bortezomib-induced
release of cytochrome c is capable of activation of caspase-9,
caspase-3, and PARP. Figure 4A shows that bortezomib treatment
resulted in the activation of caspase-9, caspase-3, and cleavage of
PARP in Colo320 and SW-480 cells. These results are consistent
with the data on cytochrome c release and indicate that activation
of effectors caspases participate in bortezomib-induced apoptosis
in CRC cells. In addition, pretreatment of Colo320 cells with

80 Amol/L z-VAD-fmk, a universal inhibitor of caspases, abrogated
apoptosis and prevented apoptosis and caspase-3 and PARP
activation induced by bortezomib (Fig. 4B and C), clearly
indicating that caspases play a critical role in bortezomib-induced
apoptosis in colon cancer cells.
Inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAP) have been shown to have
direct effects on caspase-9 and caspase-3 (36). We therefore also
examined whether bortezomib induces cell death by modulating
the expression of IAP family members that ultimately determine
the cell response to apoptotic stimuli. Colo320 cell line was treated
with 100 and 500 nmol/L bortezomib for 48 hours and expression

of cIAP1, XIAP and survivin were determined using Western
blotting. As shown in Fig. 4D, bortezomib treatment caused downregulation of cIAP1, XIAP, and survivin. These results implicate that
these survival proteins may be modulated by proteasomal
inhibition for the survival of CRC cells.
In vivo activity of proteasome inhibitor bortezomib against
CRC xenograft. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib/Velcade has
shown efficacy for the treatment of multiple myeloma as well as
other hematologic and solid tumors (37, 38). Our observation that
CRC cancer cells, like multiple myeloma, exhibit enhanced
sensitivity to proteasome inhibitor-induced apoptosis in vitro

suggests the potential for therapeutic responses to treatment of
colon cancer with proteasome inhibitors in vivo. Therefore, the
ability of proteasome inhibitor bortezomib to inhibit CRC tumor
growth was examined with a mouse xenograft model of CRC
cancer. NUDE mice were inoculated s.c. in the right abdominal
quadrant with 5 million Colo320 cells. After 1 week, mice were
randomly assigned in two groups. Mice were then treated with
bortezomib treatment group (1 mg/kg; n = 5) or 0.9% normal
saline-treated control groups (n = 5) and treated by i.p. injection
twice weekly. After 4 weeks of treatment, mice were sacrificed and
tumors were collected. As shown in Fig. 5A, bortezomib treatment
causes a time-dependent regression of Colo320-xenograft tumor in
mice compared with vehicle-treated mice. The regression reached
significance (P < 0.05) at the end of 4th week of treatment by
bortezomib. A significant reduction in tumor weight (Fig. 5B) was
observed in mice treated with bortezomib versus the control group
(P < 0.05). Additionally, images of tumor before and after necropsy
showed that bortezomib treatment resulted in shrinkage of tumor
size (Fig. 5C). Because our in vitro data showed that bortezomib
treatment down-regulated SKP2 and subsequently induced the
expression of p27Kip1 in Colo320 cell line, we tested whether
proteasome inhibition in vivo altered the expression of these

proteins. We analyzed the SKP2 and p27Kip1 level in primary
tumors derived from vehicle-treated mice and tumors treated with
bortezomib mice by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 5D, the
level of SKP2 was markedly decreased in mice treated with
bortezomib compared with vehicle-treated mice; on the other
hand, the level of p27Kip1 was increased. Densitometry analysis
indicated that the expression of SKP2 was significantly (P < 0.05)
decreased whereas the expression of p27Kip1 was significantly
increased (data not shown). It is also worthy to note that animal
treated with proteasome inhibitors did not exhibit weight loss.

Discussion
Recent studies have clearly shown that SKP2 play an essential
role in degradation of p27Kip1 (39). SKP2 protein enables efficient
transfer of ubiquitin of p27Kip1, resulting in rapid proteasomemediated degradation (9). Previous studies using purified extract
from primary colon cancer tissue suggested that increased
degradation of p27Kip1 by SKP2-dependent mechanism correlated
with increased aggressiveness of the respective tumor. The
interaction between these proteins was evident in a significant
proportion of the study tumor samples, whereby the expression of

SKP2 was inversely associated with p27Kip1 protein levels (40). We
therefore determined the role of both SKP2 and p27Kip1 as
prognostic markers and found that those CRC that exhibit
deregulation of SKP2 and p27Kip1, i.e., high level of SKP2 and
low level of p27Kip1, have decreased overall survival. These clinical
data as well as recent findings in cell lines and mice that suggest a
potential role of SKP2 mediated p27Kip1 turnover have increased
tendency of intestinal tumors to progress to a more malignant state
(41). Altogether, these findings have prompted us in analyzing
p27Kip1 regulation in CRC cell lines. Interestingly, we observed that
CRC cell lines that displayed lower levels of p27Kip1 are showing
increased level of SKP2. Proteasome inhibitors have been shown to
stabilize a multiple number of cellular proteins, initially inducing
arrest at G2-M transition and ultimately leading to programmed
cell death. Our data showed that bortezomib treatment of CRC
cells down-regulated the expression of SKP2 with reciprocal upregulation of p27Kip1, a well-known target of proteasome (42).
Inhibition of SKP2 expression by specific SKP-2–siRNA increased
p27Kip1 levels strongly, suggesting that bortezomib-mediated
down-regulation of SKP2 and up-regulation p27Kip1 likely play
significant roles in the induction of apoptosis in CRC cell lines.
Apoptosis is a multistep process and increasing numbers of genes
that are involved in the control or execution of apoptosis have been
identified (43). Our study show that proteasomal inhibition by
bortezomib in CRC cells caused apoptosis via activation of
caspase-8 and truncation of BID that translocates to the
mitochondrial membrane, allowing activation of proapoptotic
proteins and release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. Released
cytochrome c results in the formation apoptosome by interaction
with apaf1 and caspase-9, leading to the activation of caspase-3,
eventually resulting in cleavage of PARP in apoptotic cells, a
hallmark of apoptosis by various antitumor agents (44). Furthermore, pretreatment of CRC cells with a broad-spectrum caspase
inhibitor abrogated the bortezomib-induced apoptosis. These data
suggest that inhibition of ubiquitin-proteasome in CRC induced
apoptosis via caspase-cascade activation. Our in vivo studies
further validate our hypothesis that treatment of mice bearing
palpable CRC xenograft with bortezomib cause retarded tumor

growth via down-regulation of SKP2 and increased level of P27Kip1
consistent with the in vitro effect of the proteasome inhibitors.
Bortezomib represent a novel class of myeloma therapy; several
studies have shown the efficacy of the proteasome inhibitor
bortezomib in variety of tumor cell lines and its synergistic
antitumor activity has been shown in combination with other
chemotherapy (45–47). Previous studies have shown that proteasome inhibitors induce up-regulation of tumor suppressor genes
p21 and p27 via inhibition of other survival proteins, including
nuclear factor-nB (7). Furthermore, bortezomib treatment showed
synergistic antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects when combined with mitogen-activated protein kinase and EFGR inhibitor in
in vitro studies (48, 49). Our in vitro data confirm the sensitivity of
CRC cells to proteasomal inhibition. Furthermore, the apoptotic
response is significantly enhanced after combination treatment
with 5-fluorouracil and bortezomib. These data suggest that
proteasome inhibitors may be new candidate chemotherapeutic
agents for CRC treatment alone or in combination with other
conventional chemotherapeutic agents.
Together, our results establish that the SKP2 ubiquitin-proteasome plays a role in the growth and survival of CRC cells. Downregulation of SKP2 expression leads to accumulation and
stabilization of p27Kip1, leading to the induction of apoptosis in
CRC cells through release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria
and activation of downstream caspases. In addition, CRC subgroup
of patients with high SKP2 expression and low level of p27Kip1
show a poor overall survival. These studies may have important
implications for future preclinical and clinical studies in CRC.
Indeed, they may pave the way for investigations aimed at
determining the usefulness of a novel strategy for treating CRC
with inhibitors of proteasome pathways, either alone or in
combination with other agents.
