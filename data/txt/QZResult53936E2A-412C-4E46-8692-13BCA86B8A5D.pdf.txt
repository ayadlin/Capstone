Abstract
In mammalian cells, the aurora kinases (aurora-A, -B, and -C) play essential roles in regulating cell division.
The expression of aurora-A and -B is elevated in a variety of human cancers and is associated with high
proliferation rates and poor prognosis, making them attractive targets for anticancer therapy. AMG 900 is an
orally bioavailable, potent, and highly selective pan-aurora kinase inhibitor that is active in taxane-resistant
tumor cell lines. In tumor cells, AMG 900 inhibited autophosphorylation of aurora-A and -B as well as
phosphorylation of histone H3 on Ser10, a proximal substrate of aurora-B. The predominant cellular response
of tumor cells to AMG 900 treatment was aborted cell division without a prolonged mitotic arrest, which
ultimately resulted in cell death. AMG 900 inhibited the proliferation of 26 tumor cell lines, including cell lines
resistant to the antimitotic drug paclitaxel and to other aurora kinase inhibitors (AZD1152, MK-0457, and PHA739358), at low nanomolar concentrations. Furthermore, AMG 900 was active in an AZD1152-resistant HCT116
variant cell line that harbors an aurora-B mutation (W221L). Oral administration of AMG 900 blocked the
phosphorylation of histone H3 in a dose-dependent manner and significantly inhibited the growth of HCT116
tumor xenografts. Importantly, AMG 900 was broadly active in multiple xenograft models, including 3 multidrugresistant xenograft models, representing 5 tumor types. AMG 900 has entered clinical evaluation in adult
patients with advanced cancers and has the potential to treat tumors refractory to anticancer drugs such as the
taxanes. Cancer Res; 70(23); 9846–54. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Somatic cell division is a complex and highly coordinated
process that ensures faithful segregation of duplicated chromosomes into 2 daughter cells. Deregulation of the cell cycle is
a hallmark of cancer, characterized by uncontrolled proliferation and defects in chromosome segregation. Antimitotic
drugs that block tumor cell division are a proven intervention
strategy in the treatment of cancer. However, the clinical
benefits of classical antimitotic drugs may be hampered by
development of multidrug resistance (MDR) and collateral
damage to nondividing cells, including peripheral neuropathy
(1). Aurora kinases are essential mitotic regulators and their

potential role in tumorigenesis makes them attractive targets
for anticancer therapy (2–4).
In mammalian cells, the aurora family of serine/threonine
protein kinases is composed of 3 paralogous genes (aurora-A,
-B, and -C). Aurora-A and -B are essential regulators of mitotic
entry and progression, whereas aurora-C function is primarily
restricted to male meiosis during spermatogenesis (5–10).
Aurora-A can function as an oncogene and is amplified in
a subset of human tumors. The expression of aurora-A and -B
is frequently elevated in human cancers and is associated with
advanced clinical staging (11).
The mitotic checkpoint, also referred to as the spindle
assembly checkpoint (SAC), is a surveillance mechanism
responsible for controlling proper alignment, microtubule–
kinetochore attachments, and segregation of duplicated chromosomes (12). In tumor cells, genetic depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of aurora-A results in abnormal spindle
formation and SAC activation. In constrast, depletion or
inhibition of aurora-B inactivates the SAC, resulting in aborted
cell division without a mitotic arrest. Importantly, dual suppression of aurora-A and -B phenocopies the effects of inhibiting aurora-B alone (13, 14). The silencing of the SAC leads to
an accumulation of tumor cells that contain 4N DNA content
in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Continued suppression of

AMG 900, a Novel Pan-Aurora Kinase Inhibitor

aurora-B activity leads to further rounds of genome replication without division, a process referred to as endoreduplication, which ultimately results in tumor cell death (15, 16). This
mechanism of action is distinct from that of microtubulebinding antimitotic drugs (e.g., taxanes, vinca alkaloids, and
epothilones) in that death of tumor cells is primarily driven by
continued cell-cycle progression rather than by SAC activation
and prolonged cell arrest in mitosis (16, 17).
Drug resistance is a major problem limiting the efficacy of
many current anticancer therapies. The underlying mechanisms of clinical resistance to microtubule-binding agents are
multifactorial and not fully understood (18). In cultured tumor
cells, 2 prominent mechanisms of resistance to the taxanes are
overexpression of drug efflux pumps and tubulin modifications (19–21). One strategy to overcome susceptibility to the
effects of MDR would be to design a novel antimitotic drug
candidate whose activity is not influenced by drug efflux,
mediated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters such
as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (ABCB1) and BCRP (ABCG2) (22).
Moreover, a small molecule inhibitor that is equipotent
against 2 essential mitotic kinases may reduce the potential
for resistance driven by target-modifying mutations (23, 24).
Currently, a variety of ATP-competitive inhibitors that
target 1 or more of the aurora kinases and that have varying
degrees of kinase specificity are in early clinical development
(25). This report describes the preclinical activities of AMG
900, an orally bioavailable, potent, and selective pan-aurora
kinase inhibitor with activity in MDR tumor cell lines. In
contrast to paclitaxel and 3 well-characterized aurora kinase
inhibitors (AZD1152, MK-0457, and PHA-739358), AMG 900
showed uniform potency across tumor cell lines, including Pgp and BCRP-expressing cell lines. Furthermore, AMG 900 was
active in an HCT116 cell line adapted to grow in the presence
of AZD1152. This HCT116 variant cell line carries a missense
mutation in 1 allele of the aurora-B gene, resulting in an amino
acid substitution (W221L) in its activation loop. In vivo, AMG
900 blocks the phosphorylation of histone H3, a proximal
substrate of aurora-B (26), and inhibits the growth of multiple
tumor xenografts, including 3 MDR xenograft models resistant
to paclitaxel or docetaxel. Our data provide compelling evidence that AMG 900 may be active in tumors resistant to
taxanes and 3 other well-characterized inhibitors that target
aurora-B. AMG 900 is presently under clinical evaluation in
adult patients with advanced cancers.

Materials and Methods
Chemistry
AMG 900 N-(4-((3-(2-amino-4-pyrimidinyl)-2-pyridinyl)
oxy)phenyl)-4-(4-methyl-2-thienyl)-1-phthalazinamine) was
synthesized at Amgen (WO 2007087276). The molecular
structures have been disclosed for the following compounds:
paclitaxel and docetaxel (18), MLN8054 (25), MK-0457 (4),
AZD1152 (25), and PHA-739358 (25).
Cell lines
Tumor cell lines were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) unless otherwise specified. Cell

lines were grown under recommended conditions. The
HCT116 p21þ and p21 cell lines were obtained from Johns
Hopkins University under a licensing agreement. The CAL51
cell line was obtained from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (Brunswick, Germany). The
MCF-7 p53þ and p53 cell lines were generated as previously
described (27). The MDA-MB-231-PTX and NCI-H460-PTX cell
lines were established by growing the cells in the presence of
increasing concentrations of paclitaxel over a period of 6
months. The HCT116 AZD1152-resistant cell line was established by growing the cells in the presence of AZD1152 at 80
nmol/L. The histone H2B-GFP (BD Biosciences) HeLa cell line
was established at Amgen.
Animals
All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance
with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and U.S.
Department of Agriculture regulations. Four- to six-week-old
female athymic nude mice (Harlan Sprague Dawley) were
housed in sterilized cages and maintained under aseptic
conditions. Eight-week-old female BDF1 mice (Charles River
Laboratories) were housed 5 per filter-capped cage under
pathogen-free conditions. The laboratory housing the animals
provided alternating light and dark cycles (12 hours each) and
met the standards of the Association for Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care specifications. Food,
water, and nutritional supplements were offered ad libitum.
All drugs were administered on the basis of individual body
weight of each mouse.
Western blot analysis
Cell lysates were processed for Western blot analysis as
previously described (27). Immunoblots were probed with the
following antibodies: anti-aurora-A, anti-aurora-B (BD Biosciences), anti-p-aurora-A Thr288, anti-p-aurora-B Thr232, anticleaved caspase-7 Asp198, and anti-total p53 (Cell Signaling),
anti-b-actin (Sigma), and anti-p21Cip1 (Santa Cruz). Next, the
immunoblots were probed with either anti-rabbit or antimouse IgG (Vectastain kit; Vector Laboratories) and the
protein bands were detected using the Lightning-Enhanced
Chemiluminescence kit from PerkinElmer.
Details regarding enzyme assays, nocodazole block, cell
imaging assays, colony formation assays, flow cytometry
assays, aurora kinase gene analysis, pharmacodynamic assays,
tumor xenograft models, neutrophil assessment study, and
statistical analyses are described in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Results
AMG 900 is a potent and highly selective pan-aurora
kinase inhibitor
The discovery of a novel class of ATP-competitive phthalazinamine small molecule inhibitors of aurora kinases led to
the identification of AMG 900 (S. Geuns-Meyer, manuscript in
preparation). AMG 900 inhibits the enzyme activity of all 3
aurora kinase family members with IC50 values of 5 nmol/L or
less (Fig. 1A). To determine the specificity of AMG 900 across

the kinome, a panel of 26 kinases was screened and only p38a
and TYK2 enzymes were inhibited (>50%) at concentrations of
less than 500 nmol/L (Fig. 1A). Further screening was performed against a panel of 353 distinct kinases, using an ATP
site–dependent competition binding assay (28). AMG 900
exhibited low nanomolar binding affinity for aurora kinases
as well as interactions (Kd < 50 nmol/L) with DDR1, DDR2, and
LTK receptor tyrosine kinases (Fig. 1A).
To investigate the inhibition of aurora kinase activity in
cells by AMG 900, the levels of phosphorylated aurora-A
Thr288, aurora-B Thr232, and histone H3 Ser10 (p-histone
H3) were determined using Western blotting and quantitative
cell imaging techniques. In HeLa cells, AMG 900 inhibited
autophosphorylation of aurora-A and -B in a concentrationdependent manner (Fig. 1B). MLN8054 (aurora-A inhibitor)
and AZD1152 (aurora-B inhibitor) selectively blocked the
autophosphorylation of aurora-A Thr288 and aurora-B Thr232,
respectively. In the cell imaging assay, HeLa cells treated with
AMG 900 for 6 hours showed a concentration-dependent
decrease in p-aurora-A Thr288 and p-histone H3 immuno-

fluorescence staining with IC50 values of 6.5 and 8.2 nmol/L,
respectively (Fig. 1C). Next, the effects of AMG 900 on
chromosome dynamics and cell-cycle progression were
examined by live-cell imaging of HeLa cells that express a
histone H2B-GFP fusion protein. The top image panel of
Figure 1D shows a representative DMSO-treated cell entering and exiting mitosis to yield 2 daughter cells. In contrast, a
representative AMG 900–treated cell entering mitosis failed
to properly congress chromosomes to the metaphase plate,
which subsequently resulted in aborted cell division (bottom
panel of Fig. 1D). These data demonstrate that AMG 900 does
not induce a prolonged cell arrest in mitosis, consistent with
inhibition of aurora-B and SAC silencing.
Effects of AMG 900 on proliferating cells are consistent
with inhibition of aurora-B activity
Suppression of aurora-B activity in mitosis is known to
induce polyploidy in tumor cells as a consequence of cytokinesis failure. To confirm this, we first determined the concentration of AMG 900 that completely suppressed p-histone

H3 in HCT116 cells (Fig. 2A). Treatment of HCT116 cells
with 50 nmol/L of AMG 900 for 48 hours resulted in polyploidy
and suppressed the formation of colonies after cell replating
(Fig. 2B and C). Several reports have established that
inhibition of aurora-B activates the postmitotic G1 checkpoint
mediated by the p53 tumor suppressor protein (29, 30).
Consistent with these findings, AMG 900 induced a significant
increase in p53 and p21Cip1 proteins that correlated with a
corresponding decrease in 5-bromo-20 -deoxyuridine (BrdUrd)
incorporation, a direct measure of DNA synthesis (Supplementary Fig. S1). To assess the kinetics of cell death induction
by AMG 900, HCT116 cells were treated with the compound
for 48 hours, washed twice, and then cultured in complete
media lacking the compound for 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours.
Treatment with AMG 900 induced a time-dependent increase
in apoptosis measured by the induction of cleaved caspase-7
(Fig. 2D). Other mechanisms of cell death (e.g., mitotic catastrophe, multipolar cell division, and giant-cell necrosis) may
also contribute to the loss of tumor cell viability after treatment with AMG 900 (unpublished observations; 31). Consistent with the highly selective profile of AMG 900, Jurkat cells
treated with the compound for 48 hours over a 5,000-fold
concentration range (0.0012–5 mmol/L) maintained a stable
polyploidy phenotype, indicating that the dominant phenotype of AMG 900 inhibition is through inhibition of aurora-B
(data not shown). AMG 900 had no obvious toxic effects on
noncycling human foreskin fibroblast cells up to a concentration of 25 mmol/L; however, it did inhibit cell-cycle progression
(without endoreduplication) and induced cell death in proliferating human bone marrow mononuclear cells at low

AMG 900 blocks the proliferation of multiple human
tumor cell lines including cell lines resistant to
paclitaxel, AZD1152, MK-0457, and PHA-739358
To investigate the antiproliferative effects of AMG 900, a
panel of 26 cell lines from diverse tumor types were treated
with the compound for 24 hours, washed twice in complete
media lacking AMG 900, and then cultured for an additional 48
hours. Concentration–response curves and corresponding cell
count EC50 values were established for each cell line (Fig. 3A
and B). The results show that AMG 900 inhibited cell proliferation, with EC50 values ranging from 0.7 to 5.3 nmol/L.
Importantly, 4 of these AMG 900-sensitive cell lines (HCT-15,
MES-SA-Dx5, 769P, and SNU449) are resistant to paclitaxel
and other anticancer agents (32–34). To further investigate the
activity of AMG 900 in MDR cells, 4 tumor cell lines expressing
P-gp were compared with 3 non-P-gp–expressing parental cell
lines. As shown in Figure 3C, in a colony formation assay, there
was a profound decrease in the number of detectable colonies
in all of the cell lines treated with AMG 900 at 5 or 50 nmol/L.
In contrast, paclitaxel failed to inhibit colony formation in all 4
of the P-gp–expressing tumor cell lines at concentrations
effective in the parental cell lines. Intrigued by this potentially
important finding, we sought to understand whether this was
a common property of aurora kinase inhibitors. We, therefore,
evaluated 3 well-characterized aurora kinase inhibitors
(AZD1152, MK-0457, and PHA-739358) in a subset of MDR
tumor cell lines expressing either P-gp or BCRP drug efflux

resistant to paclitaxel. A and B, fluorescence-based cell count imaging assay (ArrayScan VTi) was performed on a panel of 26 tumor cell lines treated with

transporters. Interestingly, AMG 900 inhibited p-histone H3 or
induced polyploidy across all the cell lines tested irrespective
of P-gp or BCRP status with uniform potency (IC50 or EC50
values ranging from 2 to 3 nmol/L). In contrast, the other
aurora kinase inhibitors were less potent in 1 or more of the
MDR cell lines compared with the matched sensitive tumor
cell lines (Table 1). Inhibition of P-gp and BCRP drug pumps
with GF120918 (21) sensitized HCT-15 and RPMI-8226 cells to
AZD1152, suggesting that the loss of potency in the MDR cell
lines was due to drug efflux (data not shown).
To investigate alternative mechanisms of resistance to
aurora kinase inhibitors (35), HCT116 cells were adapted to
grow in the presence of AZD1152. The activity of AMG 900 was
then evaluated in the HCT116 parental and AZD1152-resistant
cell lines. The cellular 4N or greater DNA content EC50 values

for AMG 900 were 2 and 5 nmol/L compared with 34 and
672 nmol/L for AZD1152, respectively (Supplementary
Fig. S2A). AMG 900 inhibited the colony formation in both
HCT116 cell lines at concentration levels 5 nmol/L or greater,
whereas the variant subline was insensitive to AZD1152 at
50 nmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Both of the HCT116 cell
lines were equally sensitive to paclitaxel and were negative for
the expression of P-gp and BCRP (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
Interestingly, the HCT116 variant subline harbors a missense
mutation in 1 allele of the aurora-B gene (TGG ! TTG;
W221L), whereas no mutations were detected in the aurora-A
and -C genes. These results suggest that AMG 900 maintains
activity in tumor cells carrying a heterozygous mutation in
aurora-B that may be responsible for resistance to AZD1152.

vivo, mice bearing established HCT116 tumors were administered a single oral dose of vehicle alone or AMG 900 at
3.75, 7.5, or 15 mg/kg. As shown in Figure 4A and B,
administration of AMG 900 resulted in significant dosedependent inhibition of p-histone H3 in tumors compared
with the vehicle-treated control group (P  0.008). Furthermore, the degree of p-histone H3 suppression in tumors
correlated with plasma drug concentrations. AMG 900 also
inhibited p-histone H3 in mouse bone marrow cells at
comparable doses and plasma drug concentrations (data
not shown). In a separate multiple dose study using the
HCT116 tumor xenograft model, AMG 900 induced a marked
increase in the percentage of tumor cells with 4N or greater
DNA content (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Next, we compared the inhibition of aurora-B activity,
as measured by the degree and duration of p-histone H3
inhibition, with suppression of tumor growth in vivo. Mice
bearing established HCT116 tumors were orally administered vehicle alone or AMG 900 at 3.75, 7.5, or 15 mg/kg twice
daily (b.i.d.) for 2 consecutive days per week for 3 weeks. As
shown in Figure 4C, intermittent administration of AMG 900
resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth
compared with the vehicle-treated control group [3.75 mg/kg
(40%), 7.5 mg/kg (64%), 15 mg/kg (75%); P  0.0001]. The
main adverse effects observed with AMG 900 at the highest
dose were moderate body weight loss (average of 7%; Sup-

plementary Fig. S4A) with transient and reversible myelosuppression (data not shown). An alternative schedule based
on daily dosing was also tested. Mice with established
HCT116 tumors were orally administered vehicle alone or
AMG 900 at 1.5, 2.25, or 3 mg/kg b.i.d. for 3 weeks (Fig. 4D).
This continuous schedule with lower doses of AMG 900
resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition (TGI) when
compared with the vehicle-treated control group [2.25 mg/
kg (51% inhibition), P ¼ 0.0019; and 3 mg/kg (74% inhibition), P < 0.0001). Daily dosing with AMG 900 was well
tolerated with no adverse effect on body weight (Supplementary Fig. S4B), although a decrease in neutrophil counts
was observed at the end of the study (data not shown).
The effect of AMG 900 on tumor growth was further
evaluated in a panel of human xenografts, including 3 MDR
xenograft models, from 5 different tumor types (breast, colon,
lung, pancreatic, and uterine). Mice bearing established
tumors were orally administered AMG 900 at 15 mg/kg b.i.d.
for 2 consecutive days per week or at 3 mg/kg b.i.d. every
day for the duration of the study. As shown in Figure 5A,
AMG 900 exhibited significant antitumor activity in all
9 xenograft models tested (50%–97% TGI compared with
the vehicle-treated control group, P < 0.005, P < 0.0005).
Importantly, AMG 900 was active in the MES-SA-Dx5 (84%
TGI,
P < 0.0001) and NCI-H460-PTX (66% TGI, P < 0.0001)
xenograft models that were resistant to either docetaxel or
paclitaxel administered at their respective maximum tolerated
doses (Fig. 5B and C). Together, these in vivo data provide
evidence that AMG 900 inhibits the activity of aurora-B in
HCT116 tumors and suppresses the growth of multiple
xenografts that represent diverse tumor types. Notably,
our data indicate that AMG 900 has the potential to treat
tumors resistant to standard-of-care antimitotic drugs.
Because inhibition of aurora-B activity is known to cause
myelosuppression (11, 25), studies were conducted to examine
the effects of PEGylated-granulocyte colony-stimulating factor

Mice were treated with AMG 900 at 15 mg/kg b.i.d. for 2
consecutive days alone or with SD/02 at 1 mg/kg, 1 day
subsequent to the first day of AMG 900 treatment. Administration of AMG 900 alone showed a marked reduction in
neutrophils by day 4 after treatment followed by a full recovery
of neutrophils by day 8. Mice administered SD/02 1 day after
the initiation of AMG 900 treatment showed a significant
decrease in the duration of neutropenia compared with AMG
900 treatment alone [days 6, 7, and 8 (P < 0.0001) and day 11
(P < 0.0018); Supplementary Fig. S5].

Discussion
Targeting the structural components of the mitotic machinery is a proven intervention strategy in the treatment of
cancer. Microtubule-binding agents such as the taxanes and
vinca alkaloids are highly active against a variety of human
cancer types, although MDR and peripheral neuropathy
remain persistent problems. Consequently, there is a need
for novel antimitotic drugs that target nonmicrotubule proteins such as the mitotic kinases (38, 39). In the past decade,
aurora-A and -B have gained prominence as essential regulators of somatic cell division and represent promising mitotic
targets for anticancer therapy.

Cancer Res; 70(23) December 1, 2010

In this report, we have described the preclinical activities of
AMG 900, a novel potent and highly selective pan-aurora
kinase inhibitor. The predominant response of tumor cells
to AMG 900 treatment was aborted cell division without a
protracted mitotic arrest, resulting in polyploidy-specific lethality. AMG 900 induces p53 and p21Cip1 proteins, which may
act to regulate the rate of endoreduplication. Remarkably,
AMG 900 is active in all of the tested tumor cell lines at low
nanomolar concentrations, suggesting that it can inhibit the
proliferation of tumor cells irrespective of genomic alterations
or tumor origin. It is possible that the underlying profile of
genetic and epigenetic modifications in tumor cells may play
an important role in determining the fate of remnant cells that
survive AMG 900 treatment. Because cells must pass through
G2/M phase of the cell cycle in order for AMG 900 to inhibit
aurora kinase activity, other factors such as mitotic and
proliferation indices may impact tumor cell response. Further
efforts will be required to define potential susceptibility
markers to help identify the most AMG 900 vulnerable tumors
as well as determining whether combinatorial approaches
lead to durable tumor regression.
Despite the ongoing debate regarding the relevance of drug
efflux–mediated clinical resistance, the consistent potency of
AMG 900 against tumor cells irrespective of P-gp or BCRP
status may circumvent a mechanism by which tumor cells

could otherwise escape the activity of this experimental agent.
Furthermore, we found that AMG 900 is active in an AZD1152resistant cell line harboring a missense mutation in aurora-B,
resulting in an amino acid substitution (W221L) in its kinase
domain activation loop. A recent report has shown that other
aurora-B mutant alleles (Y156H, G160V) located in the ATPbinding pocket confer resistance to multiple aurora inhibitors
(35). It will be of interest to test whether AMG 900 inhibits
aurora-B activity in these catalytic domain mutants.
Consistent with our in vitro observations, AMG 900 inhibits
the phosphorylation of histone H3 and growth of multiple
human tumor xenograft models, using either intermittent or
continuous dosing schedules. Most relevant to our goal of

www.aacrjournals.org

developing an antimitotic agent that is effective against drug
resistant tumors, AMG 900 shows promising antitumor activity in tumor xenografts resistant to taxanes. As anticipated,
treatment of mice at efficacious doses of AMG 900 leads to a
transient loss of body weight and reversible myelosuppression.
In summary, AMG 900 is an orally bioavailable, potent, and
highly selective pan-aurora kinase inhibitor with activity in
taxane-resistant tumor cell lines. Together, these features
distinguish AMG 900 from other antimitotic drugs as well
as 3 other aurora kinase inhibitors (AZD1152, MK-0457, and
PHA-739358). These key attributes contribute to the profile of
this attractive clinical candidate; AMG 900 has entered phase 1
evaluation in adult patients with advanced cancers.
