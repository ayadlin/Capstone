Abstract
Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are caused by oncogenic KIT or platelet-derived growth factor
receptor activation, and the small molecule kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate is an effective ﬁrst-line therapy for
metastatic or unresectable GIST. However, complete remissions are rare and most patients ultimately develop
resistance, mostly because of secondary mutations in the driver oncogenic kinase. Hence, there is a need for novel
treatment options to delay failure of primary treatment and restore tumor control in patients who progress under
therapy with targeted agents. Historic data suggest that GISTs do not respond to classical chemotherapy, but
systematic unbiased screening has not been performed. In screening a compound library enriched for U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved chemotherapeutic agents (NCI Approved Oncology Drugs Set II), we
discovered that GIST cells display high sensitivity to transcriptional inhibitors and topoisomerase II inhibitors.
Mechanistically, these compounds exploited the cells' dependency on continuous KIT expression and/or intrinsic
DNA damage response defects, explaining their activity in GIST. Mithramycin A, an indirect inhibitor of the
SP1 transcription factor, and mitoxantrone, a topoisomerase II inhibitor, exerted signiﬁcant antitumor effects
in mouse xenograft models of human GIST. Moreover, these compounds were active in patient-derived
imatinib-resistant primary GIST cells, achieving efﬁcacy at clinically relevant concentrations. Taken together,
our ﬁndings reveal that GIST cells have an unexpectedly high and speciﬁc sensitivity to certain types of FDAapproved chemotherapeutic agents, with immediate implications for encouraging their clinical exploration.

Introduction
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are the most
common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract
and the most common sarcomas in some geographic
regions. Most GISTs are caused by activating mutations of
the KIT or PDGFRA (platelet-derived growth factor receptor

alpha) receptor tyrosine kinase genes (1–4) and can be
effectively treated with the small molecule tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; refs. 1–4). However, complete remissions are rare, and up to 50% of patients
with GIST develop resistance during the course of the ﬁrst 2
years of systemic treatment (5). Because the approved
multikinase inhibitors sunitinib malate (Sutent; ref. 6) and
regorafenib (Stivarga; ref. 7) offer only limited additional
beneﬁt for the majority of patients (8), novel therapeutic
options are needed to prolong disease stabilization, achieve
symptomatic beneﬁt, and delay the occurrence of therapy
resistance. It is known from a number of studies that
resistance to kinase inhibitors is mainly caused by secondary mutations of the driver oncogenic kinase (9, 10). Treatment strategies that do not focus on kinase inhibitors may
therefore be advantageous, but have remained largely unexplored in GISTs.
It is widely believed that GISTs respond poorly to chemotherapeutic agents commonly used to treat mesenchymal
malignancies (5, 11). This notion, however, is mainly based
on clinical studies that were carried out before the characterization of the KIT/PDGFRA driver mutations in GIST and the
introduction of speciﬁc diagnostic markers, such as KIT
immunohistochemistry. Taking into account that GISTs and

Unexpected Novel Treatment Options for GISTs

intraabdominal leiomyosarcomas (LMS) are histopathologically very similar, it is possible that earlier clinical trials
included gastrointestinal leiomyosarcomas (11), a tumor entity
that is known to be highly resistant to chemotherapy. Therefore, a reassessment of the response of GISTs to chemotherapeutic agents is warranted. Additional support for this notion
stems from the fact that histone H2AX, a component of the
DNA damage and repair machinery, has recently been found to
play a role in GIST cell viability and apoptosis (12, 13).
In this study, we performed a compound screen of U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved chemotherapeutic
agents [National Cancer Institute (NCI) Approved Oncology
Drugs Set II; ref. 14] in GIST cell lines. Unexpectedly, GIST cells
were highly sensitive to drugs targeting gene transcription or
inhibiting topoisomerase II. Two compounds, mithramycin A
and mitoxantrone, were chosen for further investigation and
proved to be active in both imatinib-sensitive and imatinibresistant GIST cell lines, patient-derived primary GIST cells,
and 2 xenograft mouse models. Mechanistically, our results are
explained by cellular dependence on oncogenically activated
KIT, which is substantially downregulated on the transcriptional level by mithramycin A, as well as high expression levels
of topoisomerase II and/or downregulation of topoisomerase I,
which sensitize GIST cells to mitoxantrone-induced DNA
damage.
Taken together, our results show that unbiased drug screens
can identify novel and unexpected drug sensitivities in GISTs
caused by the underlying biologic alterations of the tumor (15).
This approach will facilitate the development of novel treatment options and biomarkers of response with a goal toward a
personalized approach even for patients with TKI-resistant
GIST.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
The imatinib-sensitive human GIST cell lines GIST882 (kindly
provided by J.A. Fletcher, Brigham and Women's Hospital,
Boston, MA) and GIST-T1 (16) were derived from untreated
metastatic GISTs (12, 17). GIST882 cells carry a homozygous
mutation in KIT exon 13 (K642E; ref. 18), whereas GIST-T1 cells
carry a heterozygous KIT exon 11 deletion (V560_Y578del;
ref. 16). Imatinib-resistant GIST cell lines GIST430, GIST48, and
GIST48B (kindly provided by J.A. Fletcher; ref. 19) were grown as
previously described (13). These cells were derived from human
GISTs that developed clinical resistance to imatinib therapy.
GIST430 carries a heterozygous primary KIT exon 11 deletion
(V560_L576del) and a secondary KIT exon 13 point mutation
(V654A), whereas GIST48 cells are characterized by a homozygous primary KIT exon 11 mutation (V560D) and a secondary
KIT exon 17 mutation (D820A). GIST48B cells are derived from
GIST48 cells, with which they share the KIT mutational status,
but have no detectable KIT protein expression (19).
Leiomyosarcoma cell lines (SK-UT1, SK-LMS; American
Type Culture Collection) and normal human dermal ﬁbroblasts (Lonza) were maintained according to manufacturer's
recommendations.
A short-term culture was established from a patient with a
clinically imatinib- and sunitinib-refractory GIST that

www.aacrjournals.org

underwent surgery for removal of a progressing lesion at
UPMC Presbyterian Hospital (Pittsburgh, PA; Institutional
Review Board protocol no. 0509050) as previously described
(13).
In vitro apoptosis and proliferation assays
Apoptosis and cell viability studies were performed using
Caspase-Glo and CellTiter-Glo luminescence-based assays
(Promega; ref. 13). Cells were plated in 96-well ﬂat-bottomed
plates (Perkin Elmer), cultured for 24 hours, and then incubated for 48 hours (Caspase-Glo) or 72 hours (CellTiter-Glo)
with the respective compounds at indicated concentrations or
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-only solvent control. Luminescence was measured with a BioTek Synergy 2 Luminometer
(BioTek). Data were normalized to the DMSO-only control
group.
Compound screen and inhibitor treatments
The NCI Approved Oncology Drugs Set II compound
library was obtained from the NCI under a material transfer
agreement. It contains 89 FDA-approved anticancer drugs
dissolved at 10 mmol/L concentration in DMSO. The full list
of drugs is available from the NCI (14) and is also shown in
Supplementary Table S1. Cells were cultured in 96-well
plates and each screen was performed in triplicate at 2 drug
concentrations, 1 and 10 mmol/L, to allow for some therapeutic range. Treatment with DMSO, the KIT inhibitors
imatinib and sunitinib (both at 1 mmol/L in DMSO) as well
as the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (0.01 mmol/L in
DMSO; all from LC Laboratories) was included in each set of
experiments (in triplicate) as negative and positive controls,
respectively. Cellular viability and apoptosis were assessed
by using luminescence-based assays.
Results from the triplicate screens were averaged and normalized to their respective average DMSO control. These
results were then combined into a "response score" using the
ðapoptosisÞþð1=viabilityÞ

formula (drug-response score ¼
) to
2
reﬂect the fact that luminescence values for increased apoptosis were >1 and values for decreased cell viability were <1.
Hits were deﬁned as having a response score 2-fold over
DMSO-treated cells (i.e., 2). Very similar results were
obtained when a response score greater than the imatinib (in
imatinib-sensitive cells) or sunitinib (in imatinib-resistant
cells) score was considered as hit.
For follow-up studies, cells were incubated in imatinib (1
mmol/L), mithramycin A (at various concentrations in DMSO
as indicated; Sigma), mitoxantrone (at various concentrations
in DMSO as indicated; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc), a-amanitin (1
mg/mL in dH2O; Sigma), or mock treated with 0.1% DMSO or
dH2O for up to 72 hours as indicated.
Immunologic and cell staining methods
Protein lysates of cells growing as monolayer were prepared
as described previously (20). Xenograft specimens were minced
on ice in the presence of lysis buffer and homogenized using a
Tissue Tearor (BioSpec; ref. 20). Thirty micrograms of protein
were loaded on a 4% to 12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and
blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane.

Unexpected Novel Treatment Options for GISTs

Immunoﬂuorescence analysis for phosphorylated RNA polymerase II and CREB binding protein (CBP) was performed as
described previously (12). To assess the cellular localization of
pATM S1981, pH2AX S139, MRE11 and 53BP1, Alexa Fluor 488-,
or Cy3þ-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen and
Jackson Immunoresearch, respectively) were used (30 minutes
at room temperature in the dark). Cells were analyzed using an
Olympus AX70 epiﬂuorescence microscope equipped with a
SpotRT digital camera.
Immunohistochemic staining of parafﬁn-embedded mouse
xenograft sections was done as described previously (21).
Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting, immunoﬂuorescence, and immunohistochemistry were the following:
actin (Sigma); ATM and pATM S1981 (both Epitomics); pATM
S1981 (Rockland); CBP (Santa Cruz A); cyclin A (Novocastra);
cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling); H2AX (Bethyl); pH2AX S139
(Millipore); pH3 S10, pKIT Y719 (both Cell Signaling); KIT
(DakoCytomation); MRE11 (Novus); PARP (Invitrogen/Zymed
Laboratories); RNA polymerase II, pRNA polymerase II S2,
and pRNA polymerase II S5 (all Covance); Topoisomerase I
(Abcam); Topoisomerase II (Cell Signaling); p27Kip1 (BD Biosciences Pharmingen); and 53BP1 (Calbiochem).
Apoptotic cells were visualized using the In situ Cell Death
Detection Kit (Roche Applied Sciences) according to manufacturer's recommendations (12).
Reverse transcriptase-PCR and quantitative real-time
reverse transcriptase-PCR
Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and quantitative real-time
RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) were performed as described previously
(13, 22). Exon-overlapping, mRNA/cDNA-speciﬁc primers were
used to amplify KIT (forward: 50 -TCATGGTCGGATCACAAAGA30 , reverse: 50 -AGGGGCTGCTTCCTAAAGAG-30 ; Operon) and
b-actin (forward: 50 -CCAAGGCCAACCGCGAGAAGATGAC-30 ,
reverse: 50 -AGGGTACATGGTGGTGCCGCCAGAC-30 ). b-Actin
served as reference gene for relative quantiﬁcation in qRT-PCR
experiments.
Comet assay
DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) were detected by using the
CometAssay Kit from Trevigen under neutral conditions (23).
In brief, cells were treated with DMSO or mitoxantrone for the
indicated amount of time. Apoptotic cells were excluded from
the assay by removing the supernatant before trypsinising.
Cells were then washed in ice-cold PBS, diluted to 75,000 cells/
mL, and added to molten LMAgarose. After spotting onto 2well CometSlides and solidifying, slides were immersed in lysis
solution and electrophoresed in chilled TBE buffer (21 V, 10
minutes). Slides were then ﬁxed in 70% ethanol and dried. DNA
was labeled with SYBR Green and slides were viewed under a
Nikon ECLIPSE 50i epiﬂuorescence microscope (Nikon). Com-

et tails were analyzed using CometAssay IV v4.2 software
(Perceptive Instruments). At least 100 cells were analyzed per
sample.
GIST xenograft models
GIST882 or GIST-T1 cells were bilaterally injected in the
ﬂank of female adult athymic nude mice (NMRI, nu/nu; Janvier
Laboratories; refs. 21 and 24). When tumors were 1 cm in
diameter, mice were randomized into groups of 4 animals each
for each treatment regimen. Mithramycin A (0.5 mg/kg in PBS)
or mitoxantrone (1.5 mg/kg in 0.9% NaCl) was administered
intraperitoneally (i.p.) 3 times a week or every 4 days, respectively, for 2 weeks (25, 26). Mice receiving PBS (150 mL, i.p.) were
used as negative control. Tumor volume, weight, and general
health of the mice were recorded (21). After the mice were
sacriﬁced, tumors were excised and divided for fresh-frozen
samples and histopathologic examination. The animal experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee of KU Leuven
(Leuven, Belgium).
Histopathologic grading of the response to the compounds was performed (21, 27) and was based on the
microscopic amount of necrosis, myxoid degeneration, or
ﬁbrosis with grade 1 representing a minimal response (0–
10%) and grade 4 representing a maximal response (>90%).
Apoptotic and mitotic cells were visualized by immunohistochemical staining for cleaved caspase-3 and phosphorylated histone H3 S10, respectively (21). The number of
positive cells was counted per 10 high power ﬁelds (HPF)
at 400-fold magniﬁcation.
Statistics
Statistical signiﬁcance was assessed using the Student t test
for independent samples and the Mann–Whitney U test for not
normally distributed samples (VassarStats, http://vassarstats.
net). P values  0.05 were considered signiﬁcant. Unsupervised
hierarchical clustering analysis was performed using Cluster
3.0 (28) and visualized using MapleTree (http://www.eisenlab.
org/eisen).

Results
A compound screen identiﬁes inhibitors of transcription
and of topoisomerase II as active agents against GIST
cells
To determine the sensitivity of GIST cells to chemotherapeutic agents, we performed a screen using the NCI/NIH
Approved Oncology Drugs Set II (14), which consists of 89
FDA-approved compounds (Supplementary Table S1).
Two imatinib-sensitive (GIST882 and GIST-T1) and 3 imatinib-resistant (GIST430, GIST48, and GIST48B) human
GIST cell lines were tested. Because it is conceivable that
historically GISTs were frequently misclassiﬁed as

abdominal leiomyosarcoma, 2 leiomyosarcomas cell lines
(SK-LMS and SK-UT-1) were analyzed in direct comparison.
A total of 37 compounds were identiﬁed that had antitumor
activity in at least 1 GIST cell line for at least one of the
concentrations tested (Supplementary Table S1). Many of the
active compounds had response scores that were substantially
higher than the response scores of imatinib or sunitinib.
Importantly, a 2-way unsupervised hierarchical clustering
analysis separated GIST and leiomyosarcoma cells (Fig. 1).
Although 1 GIST cell line (GIST430) clustered close to the SKLMS and SK-UT-1 cells, this unbiased analysis underscores a
trend toward the different drug sensitivities of these 2 tumor
entities. Compounds that showed activity in GIST cells clustered according to their mode of action (Fig. 1). The most
effective compound classes were transcriptional inhibitors and
inhibitors of topoisomerase II, especially those with intercalating properties.
The most effective compound in our screen was the
proteasome inhibitor bortezomib with strong activity in all
GIST cell lines tested. This conﬁrms our previous study that
had identiﬁed bortezomib as an effective compound against
GIST cells (13). The compounds that ranked second and
third in antineoplastic efﬁcacy were the transcriptional
inhibitors mithramycin A and dactinomycin, which showed
activity in all GIST lines tested (Fig. 1 and Supplementary
Table S1). Remarkably, bortezomib has previously been
shown to function in part through blocking ongoing gene
transcription in GIST (13) and these 3 compounds, mithramycin A, dactinomycin, and bortezomib, were found to
cluster (Fig. 1).
Additional agents with high antitumor activity in GIST
cells were topoisomerase II inhibitors, especially those with
an additional intercalating property, such as mitoxantrone,
daunorubicin, doxorubicin, and valrubicin (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S1). GIST cells were resistant to most
alkylating agents as well as estrogen receptor modulators,
aromatase inhibitors, photo-activated drugs, and immunomodulatory agents (Supplementary Table S1). Microtubule
poisons showed some sensitivity in GIST48 and its derivative
GIST48B (Supplementary Table S1) but not in other GIST
cell lines.
Taken together, our screen of a library of FDA-approved
compounds in GIST cells showed signiﬁcant antitumor activity
of 2 main drug classes, inhibitors of gene transcription and
inhibitors of topoisomerase II.
Mithramycin A and mitoxantrone are effective inducers
of apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in imatinib-sensitive
and imatinib-resistant GIST cells
Having identiﬁed inhibitors of gene transcription and topoisomerase II inhibitors as 2 main drug classes with activity in
GIST cells, we selected one compound of each class, mithramycin A and mitoxantrone, for further validation. These studies were carried out in 1 imatinib-sensitive (GIST882) and 1
imatinib-resistant (GIST430) cell line.
Treatment of GIST882 and GIST430 cells with increasing
concentrations of mithramycin A (0.001–10 mmol/L) induced a
statistically signiﬁcant proapoptotic and growth-suppressive

1204

Cancer Res; 74(4) February 15, 2014

effect that was seen in both cell lines beginning at concentrations of 0.1 mmol/L (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Likewise, concentration-dependent cleavage of PARP and
caspase-3 was detected by immunoblotting in both cell lines
starting at 0.1 mmol/L, indicating the onset of apoptosis
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). At the same time, expression of the
S-phase marker cyclin A decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. Based on these results, the lowest effective
concentration of mithramycin A was deﬁned as 0.1 mmol/L
and was used in all further experiments.
For mitoxantrone, a statistically signiﬁcant increase in
apoptosis and reduction of cell viability was seen starting at
0.1 mmol/L in GIST882 (Fig. 2B), whereas these effects were
only seen at concentrations of 1.0 and 10.0 mmol/L in GIST430
(Fig. 2B). A terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay conﬁrmed the higher
sensitivity of GIST882 to mitoxantrone when compared with
GIST430 (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Immunoblot analysis
showed strong apoptosis-associated PARP and caspase-3
cleavage after 1.0 mmol/L mitoxantrone in GIST882, whereas
the effect was less pronounced in GIST430 at these concentrations (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Protein expression of the
S-phase marker cyclin A was completely lost at 10 mmol/L in
both GIST882 and GIST430 (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Based on
these results, the minimum effective concentrations for mitoxantrone was deﬁned as 1 mmol/L for GIST882 and 5 mmol/L in
GIST430.
It is important to note that the minimal effective concentrations deﬁned in our study (0.1 mmol/L mithramycin A and 1
to 5 mmol/L mitoxantrone) are clinically achievable in humans.
Plasma levels of mithramycin have been reported to reach peak
concentrations of 0.30 to 0.35 mmol/L after a 2-hour continuous
infusion of the standard dose of 25 mg/kg (29). The standard
dose of mitoxantrone in humans (10–14 mg/m2) produces
peak plasma concentrations in the range of 1.0 mmol/L (30–32),
but high-dose regimens using up to 80 mg/m2 have been tested
extensively and have been deemed safe (33). In summary, these
results demonstrate that mithramycin A and mitoxantrone
exert their antineoplastic activities in GIST cells at concentrations that are relevant for the clinic and can be achieved in the
sera of patients with cancer (32, 34).
The response to mithramycin A and mitoxantrone is time
dependent
To ascertain the time dependency of the effects of mithramycin A and mitoxantrone in GIST cells, we treated GIST882
and GIST430 cells at the minimal effective concentrations for 1
to 72 hours (Fig. 2C–E).
Mithramycin A caused an apoptotic response starting after
24 hours in GIST882 and GIST430 cells (Fig. 2C and D). Levels of
the S-phase marker cyclin A decreased in parallel with apoptosis induction (Fig. 2C).
Mitoxantrone induced a more rapid onset of apoptosis in
GIST882 starting after 8 hours of treatment (Fig. 2E). In
GIST430 cells, an apoptotic response was detected after 24
hours (Fig. 2E). There was a very strong apoptotic effect in
GIST430 after 72 hours as reﬂected by nearly complete PARP
and caspase-3 degradation (Fig. 2E and F). Mitoxantrone also

(8 hours in GIST882 and 24 hours in GIST430) that may reﬂect
distinct mechanisms of action.
Mithramycin A leads to loss of KIT expression,
transcriptional inhibition, and activation of a DNA
damage response
We next sought to conﬁrm the mechanism of action of the
proapoptotic and growth inhibitory activities of mithramycin
A and mitoxantrone in GIST cells.
Mithramycin A has DNA-binding properties that lead to an
inhibition of gene transcription mediated by SP1 (35, 36), one of
the major transcriptional activators of the KIT gene (37).
Because expression of oncogenically activated KIT is a
tumor-speciﬁc, crucial driver of GIST pathogenesis and survival, GIST cells are critically dependent on the expression of
mutant KIT (12, 13, 38). We therefore tested ﬁrst whether
mithramycin A treatment causes a downregulation of KIT
transcription. We found a substantial downregulation of KIT
mRNA expression levels in mithramycin A–treated GIST cells
by RT-PCR and qRT-PCR (Fig. 3A). The effect was comparable
with cells treated with the RNA polymerase (pol) II inhibitor
a-amanitin (Fig. 3A). Importantly, reduced KIT mRNA levels
after mithramycin A treatment led to a complete abrogation of
KIT protein expression and activation starting at 8 hours after
treatment in both GIST882 and GIST430 cells (Fig. 3B). The
effect on KIT transcription and expression was speciﬁc for
mithramycin A, because it was not seen in cells treated with
mitoxantrone (Fig. 3A).
To further characterize the effects of mithramycin A on
ongoing gene transcription, we determined expression and
activation of the core transcriptional machinery. Mithramycin
A led to a loss of active RNA pol II from chromatin both in its
initiating form (S5 phosphorylation of the RNA pol II carboxylterminal repeat domain, CTD) and elongating form (S2 phosphorylation of the CTD; Fig. 3C; ref. 39). Immunoblotting
demonstrated a loss of pRNA pol II S5 and S2 as well as total
RNA pol II in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3D), a ﬁnding that
has been described to occur during prolonged transcriptional
stalling (40). In addition, mithramycin A induced a redistribution of the transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein
(CBP) into a coarsely speckled pattern in the nucleus (foci) that
is associated with inactive gene transcription (Fig. 3E; ref. 39).
These results underscore that reduced KIT mRNA levels after
mithramycin A may be the result of 2 mechanisms: inhibition
of SP1-mediated transcription and a more general attenuation
of ongoing gene transcription. Furthermore, it is likely that
both processes affect additional vital gene products thereby
adding to the effectiveness of the drug.
It has been shown that a prolonged transcriptional block can
cause DNA damage (41). In addition, direct binding of mithramycin A to DNA can potentially lead to DNA replication fork
stalling (35, 36). We therefore asked whether mithramycin A
treatment would also induce a measurable DNA damage
response. We found that mithramycin A led to an increase of
phosphorylated ATM S1981 after approximately 24 hours (Fig.
3F). This DNA damage response effect was somewhat delayed
when compared with the measurable onset of transcriptional
inhibition (approximately 8 hours), suggesting that the induc-

1206

tion of DNA damage is a secondary effect that may be cell-cycle
dependent. In line with this notion, a proportion of cells is still
expressing S-phase markers at 24 hours after mithramycin A
treatment (Fig. 2C). The fact that pATM S1981 and pH2AX S139
nuclear foci that colocalized with MRE11 and 53BP1, respectively, were detected (Fig. 3G) underscored the induction of a
DNA DSB response.
Taken together, mithramycin A has a dual mechanism of
targeting GIST cells for apoptosis by inhibiting ongoing gene
transcription and inducing DNA damage.
Mitoxantrone induces a rapid DNA DSB response in GIST
cells
As expected, based on its known mode of action (42),
mitoxantrone rapidly induced phosphorylation of the DNA
DSB response protein ATM at S1981 in both GIST882 and
GIST430 cells (1 hour; Fig. 4A). In addition, mitoxantrone led to
the formation of DSB-associated nuclear pH2AX S139 foci in
GIST882 and GIST430 (Fig. 4B).
To prove that the rapid ATM phosphorylation induced by
mitoxantrone indeed represents the induction of DNA DSBs, a
Comet assay was performed. Mitoxantrone treatment caused
DNA fragmentation as evidenced by so-called Comet tails in
GIST882 and GIST430 cells (Fig. 4C). This effect was quantiﬁed
by analyzing Comet tail intensity and tail moment, both of
which were signiﬁcantly altered after mitoxantrone treatment,
indicating DNA breakage (Fig. 4C, right).
Topoisomerase expression levels have been shown to correlate with sensitivity to topoisomerase II inhibitors, including
mitoxantrone (43). In particular, low expression levels of
topoisomerase II have been reported to confer drug resistance,
whereas high levels can sensitize to topoisomerase II inhibition
(44). Moreover, low levels of topoisomerase I were found to
correlate with increased sensitivity to topoisomerase II inhibitors (44). We hence analyzed topoisomerase I and II protein
expression in GIST882 and GIST430 by immunoblotting
(Fig. 4D). We found a markedly decreased expression of
topoisomerase I in GIST882 cells in comparison with controls
as well as increased levels of topoisomerase II expression in
GIST430, which can explain the sensitivity of these cells to
mitoxantrone. However, this ﬁnding does not readily explain
the lower sensitivity of GIST430 to the drug when compared
with GIST882.
To further explore this perplexing ﬁnding, we decided to
further dissect the DNA DSB response in GIST430 cells in
comparison with GIST882 cells after mitoxantrone treatment.
As shown by immunoﬂuorescence microscopy, GIST430 cells
had a severe defect in the proper formation of DNA damage–
associated nuclear foci that contain pATM S1981 and 53BP1
(Fig. 4E). This ﬁnding correlated with the inability of GIST430
cells to maintain ATM phosphorylation (Fig. 4A) despite the
presence of broken DNA (Fig. 4C).
Taken together, our results show that mitoxantrone induces
DNA breakage in both GIST882 and GIST430 cells. Although
GIST882 cells mount a rapid DNA damage response and start
to undergo apoptosis after 8 hours of drug treatment, GIST430
show a defective DNA damage response and a delayed but
massive apoptosis induction (Fig. 2F). Apoptosis in these cells

Unexpected Novel Treatment Options for GISTs

is therefore most likely not because of a coordinated DNA
damage-induced activation of proapoptotic pathways (as in
GIST882), but rather because of a mechanism that involves
transition into a different cell-cycle stage, such as mitotic
catastrophe (45).
Inhibitors of transcription and of topoisomerase II are
effective in patient-derived imatinib and sunitinib
double-resistant GIST cells
Having shown that mithramycin A and mitoxantrone have
signiﬁcant activity in permanent imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant GIST cell lines, we aimed to corroborate our
results in patient-derived primary GIST cells. As expected,
treatment of clinically imatinib- and sunitinib-resistant primary GIST cells with imatinib or sunitinib had no effect on
tumor cell viability (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Of 5 compounds
tested in these primary cells, only treatment with mithramycin
A led to signiﬁcant caspase-3 cleavage and almost complete
degradation of PARP, indicating a strong apoptotic response.
Mithramycin A and treatment with the topoisomerase II
inhibitor etoposide (5 mmol/L) led to a substantial reduction
of cell proliferation as measured by decreased levels of cyclin A
and an increase in p27Kip1 levels. Of note, the proteasome
inhibitor bortezomib also induced apoptosis as detected by a
PARP cleavage fragment in these cells.

Mithramycin A and mitoxantrone are effective in GIST
xenograft models
Finally, we tested the antitumor activity of mithramycin A
and mitoxantrone in vivo using GIST xenograft models (21, 24).
Both mithramycin A and mitoxantrone had a signiﬁcant
effect on apoptosis induction and cell-cycle inhibition as
detected by immunoblotting of proteins extracted from
excised GIST882 xenografts (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Both
compounds also induced major histopathologic changes in
this model (Fig. 5A). Mithramycin A treatment led to a dramatic response according to a previously deﬁned histopathologic response score (21, 27). Importantly, these morphologic
ﬁndings, which included a central necrosis surrounded by a
zone of myxoid degeneration, phenocopy the in vivo response
to imatinib treatment (21). The histopathologic response to
mitoxantrone was remarkably different and resulted in extensive intratumoral hemorrhage and single cell death (Fig. 5A).
Both mithramycin A or mitoxantrone treatment caused a
signiﬁcantly increased intratumoral apoptosis as detected by
immunohistochemical staining for cleaved caspase-3 (464 and
327 apoptotic cells per 10 HPF in mithramycin A- and mitoxantone-treated cells, respectively, compared with 66 apoptotic
cells/10 HPF in placebo-treated controls; P < 0.0003 and
<0.0001, respectively; Fig. 5B). Furthermore, treatment with
mithramycin A or mitoxantrone signiﬁcantly reduced the

number of mitotic cells as measured by positivity for phosphorylated histone H3 S10 (from 155/10 HFP in controls to 100
and 82/10 HPF in mithramycin A- and mitoxantrone-treated
cells, respectively; P < 0.023 and <0.009; Fig. 5C). These results
were conﬁrmed in a second xenograft model (GIST-T1; ref. 24),
in which mithramycin A and mitoxantrone also signiﬁcantly
reduced the number of histone H3 S10-positive mitotic cells
(from 381/10 HPF in controls to 158 and 132/10 HPF in
mithramycin A- and mitoxantrone-treated cells, respectively;
both P < 0.0001; Supplementary Fig. S3C).
Although there was no objective reduction in tumor size
after mithramycin A or mitoxantrone, the growth of the
xenografts was attenuated when compared with control-treated animals (Supplementary Fig. S3D and S3E). Importantly
however, mithramycin A or mitoxantrone treatments did lead
to signiﬁcant intratumoral changes as described above, thereby clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of the treatment
(Fig. 5A). It is of note that such changes would not necessarily
result in a reduction of tumor size, which is in line with the
typical clinical response to imatinib as well as imatinib-treated
xenografts (21).
Taken together, both mithramycin A and mitoxantrone
treatment showed signiﬁcant antitumor activity in vivo using
GIST xenograft mouse models.

Discussion
Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) has revolutionized treatment
and prognosis of patients with GIST (2). Nevertheless, the
majority of patients develops resistance to imatinib as well
as the only FDA-approved second- and third-line therapies,
sunitinib malate (Sutent) and regorafenib (Stivarga), over time
(5, 7, 8). Novel therapeutic strategies are hence urgently
needed.
To effectively identify active compounds and to be able to
rapidly move candidate drugs into the clinic, we screened
compounds of the NCI Approved Oncology Drugs Set II (14)
for their antitumor activity in a panel of GIST cell lines. We
identiﬁed a number of highly active compounds that mostly
belonged to 2 distinct drug classes, inhibitors of gene transcription and topoisomerase II inhibitors.
The notion that GISTs are not sensitive to conventional
chemotherapy originates from earlier clinical trials (11) that
may have been biased by the inadvertent inclusion of histopathologically similar, but highly chemoresistant tumors, such
as abdominal leiomyosarcomas. As a result, the actual
response rate of GISTs to chemotherapy may have been
underestimated. Neither mithramycin A nor mitoxantrone,
the 2 compounds that were chosen for further follow-up in
our study because of their high activity in GIST cells in vitro and
in vivo, have systematically been tested for systemic treatment
of GIST.
Nevertheless, it is of note that mitoxantrone yielded favorable results when used intraperitoneally to prevent local
recurrence of abdominal sarcomas (46). It is worth mentioning,
however, that this study did not record the clinical effect of the
treatment by histopathologic tumor entity. In addition, data
were obtained during the early 1990s, when an unequivocal
identiﬁcation of GISTs was difﬁcult because of the lack of

1210

Cancer Res; 74(4) February 15, 2014

reliable diagnostic markers. Yet, there is more recent evidence
for the clinical activity of topoisomerase II inhibitors in GIST.
When treated with doxorubicin in combination with imatinib,
36% of imatinib-resistant patients were reported to have had
clinical beneﬁt, especially a subgroup of patients without
detectable KIT/PDGFRA mutations (47). Conversely, our compound screen highlighted a remarkable resistance of GIST cells
to alkylating agents. These results are supported by clinical
ﬁndings from a study that tested the alkylator temozolomide in
patients with GIST and found a very low response rate to this
treatment (48). Taken together, our systematic approach to
revisiting chemotherapeutic agents for GIST therapy resulted
in the identiﬁcation of highly effective but also inactive compounds that, to a certain extent, are reﬂected by anecdotal
clinical evidence. Interestingly, a recent study reported activity
of another FDA-approved compound, auranoﬁn, an oral, goldcontaining agent used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, in GIST
cells (49).
Mithramycin A has recently gained attention in the treatment of Ewing sarcoma (25). This compound was the top hit in
a 50,000 compound screen to identify inhibitors of the EWSFLI1 transcription factor, the hallmark of the Ewing sarcoma
family of tumors (25). Similar to the results presented here, the
minimally active concentration of mithramycin A was relatively low (0.1 mmol/L), an activated DNA damage response
was detected, and the compound was effective in a xenograft
model. A study testing the clinical activity of mithramycin in
patients with Ewing sarcoma has been initiated and is currently recruiting patients (NCT01610570; ref. 50). Thus, mithramycin A seems to be particularly effective in sarcomas and
other malignancies, including GIST, that critically depend on
ongoing gene transcription.
Mithramycin A competitively binds to GC-rich promoter
regions thereby replacing the transcription factor SP1 (35, 36).
Through this mechanism, mithramycin A inhibits the transcription of many SP1-regulated genes such as MYC and SRC
(51, 52). Interestingly, SP1 is also a major transcriptional
activator of the KIT gene (37) and its inhibition in GIST cells
by mithramycin A thus led to a substantial decrease of KIT
mRNA and protein expression and hence reduced KIT activation. Because of the essential role that expression of oncogenic
KIT plays for GIST cell survival, these changes provide a
compelling mechanistic explanation for the induction of apoptosis in these cells. Moreover, inhibition of SP1-mediated
transcription of SRC family kinase (SFK) expression could
have an additive effect of mithramycin A treatment in GIST
as SFKs have been shown to play important roles in GIST cell
biology (52, 53). Because of its role as inhibitor of SP1, it has
been postulated that mithramycin A leads to a relatively genespeciﬁc downregulation of transcription. However, in our
study we detected displacement and loss of active RNA polymerase II and the transcriptional coactivator CBP from chromatin after treatment with mithramycin A, indicating a more
global inhibition of cellular transcription that may affect
additional vital gene products. In addition to the direct effect
on gene transcription, we could show that mithramycin A
triggered a DNA damage response in GISTs, as indicated by the
formation of DNA damage-associated nuclear foci. This

Unexpected Novel Treatment Options for GISTs

response was delayed when compared with DNA DSB inducers
(such as mitoxantrone) as well as the onset of downregulation
of KIT expression by mithramycin A, indicating that it is a
secondary effect that occurs after prolonged transcriptional
stalling and/or when a stalled DNA replication fork at the site
of mithramycin A binding to DNA is converted to a DSB. Taken
together, mithramycin A may be speciﬁcally effective in GIST
through several mechanisms: competitive displacement of SP1
from the KIT promoter leading to rapid downregulation of KIT
expression and activation, transcriptional downregulation of
cellular oncoproteins other than KIT, such as SRC, global
inhibition of cellular transcription, and the induction of a DNA
DSB response. All mechanisms are independent of direct KIT
kinase inhibition and therefore irrespective of a secondary
mutation as mechanism of resistance meaning that mithramycin A is effective in imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant GIST.
Topoisomerase II inhibitors, such as mitoxantrone, are
known to induce DNA breakage by stabilizing a usually transient DSB that is catalyzed by topoisomerase II to relieve
conformational and topologic changes in DNA during replication. Mitoxantrone has been shown to rapidly induce these
breaks in vitro (54), a ﬁnding that we conﬁrmed in GIST cells by
showing a rapid activation of ATM as well as by the detection of
fragmented DNA in a Comet assay. Although protein expression levels of topoisomerase I (low in GIST882) and II (high in
GIST430) could explain the sensitivity of GIST882 cells, they
failed to explain the lower sensitivity and delayed apoptosis
induction in GIST430 cells. However, we discovered that
GIST430 cells have a defective DNA damage response and fail
to assemble proper DNA damage foci and maintain ATM
activation despite DNA damage. It is hence possible that
GIST882 cells rapidly undergo apoptosis in response to DNA
damage by activating proapoptotic signaling pathways. In
contrast, GIST430 cells seem to contain damaged DNA without
a proper DNA damage response, which could trigger alternative forms of cell death that require a longer time interval, such
as mitotic catastrophe, where cells have to move to a different
cell-cycle stage before they undergo cell death.
One possibility of achieving an enhanced therapeutic effect
is to use drugs in combination. In an attempt to do so, we
have tested several combinations of imatinib with either
mithramycin A or mitoxantrone in both imatinib-sensitive
and imatinib-resistant GIST cells in vitro. These preliminary
experiments did not show evidence for synergy (data not
shown). Interestingly, similar results were obtained in a study
by Lee and colleagues when simultaneously treating breast
cancer cells with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib and the topoisomerase II inhibitor doxorubicin (55). Time-staggered,

sequential treatments, however, signiﬁcantly sensitized these
cells to undergo apoptosis, presumably because of extensive
network rewiring. Addressing this question in GIST cells will be
subject of future studies.
In summary, we have shown that an unbiased compound
screen can identify novel drug sensitivities in GIST that can be
exploited clinically. Importantly, we were able to link drug
activities to intrinsic molecular requirements and defects, such
as continued KIT transcription, differences in topoisomerase
expression, or defects in the cellular DNA damage response.
Our study provides a framework for the future development of
mono- or combination therapies and biomarkers predicting
the individual response of patients with GIST with an aim
toward more complete remissions and improved long-term
disease control.
