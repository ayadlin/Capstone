Abstract
The oncoprotein MDM2, a major ubiquitin E3 ligase of tumor
suppressor p53, has been suggested as a novel target for
human cancer therapy based on its p53-dependent and p53independent activities. We have identified curcumin, which
has previously been shown to have anticancer activity, as an
inhibitor of MDM2 expression. Curcumin down-regulates
MDM2, independent of p53. In a human prostate cancer cell
lines PC3 (p53 null ), curcumin reduced MDM2 protein and
mRNA in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and enhanced
the expression of the tumor suppressor p21Waf1/CIP1 . The
inhibitory effects occur at the transcriptional level and seem
to involve the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mammalian
target of rapamycin/erythroblastosis virus transcription factor
2 pathway. Curcumin induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of PC3 cells in culture, but both MDM2 overexpression and knockdown reduced these effects. Curcumin
also inhibited the growth of these cells and enhanced the
cytotoxic effects of gemcitabine. When it was administered to
tumor-bearing nude mice, curcumin inhibited growth of PC3
xenografts and enhanced the antitumor effects of gemcitabine
and radiation. In these tumors, curcumin reduced the
expression of MDM2. Down-regulation of the MDM2 oncogene
by curcumin is a novel mechanism of action that may be
essential for its chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic
effects. Our observations help to elucidate the process by
which mitogens up-regulate MDM2, independent of p53, and
identify a mechanism by which curcumin functions as an
anticancer agent. [Cancer Res 2007;67(5):1988–96]

Introduction
MDM2, the cellular ubiquitin E3 ligase of the tumor suppressor
p53, is considered to be an oncoprotein because of its activity in
promoting p53 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (1).
Further, MDM2 binds to the NH2 terminus of p53 and blocks its
transactivational activities (1). The activation of p53 target genes
induces apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and senescence, which are
important to tumor suppression (2, 3). Recently, p53-independent
tumorigenic mechanisms for MDM2 have been identified (4).
MDM2 also binds to other proteins with a wide range of functions

(4). For example, MDM2 promotes cell cycle progression by binding
to and modulating the activities of p21Waf1/CIP1 (5, 6) and E2F1
proteins (7). Both animal studies with transgenic mice and clinical
observations have established the role of MDM2 in cancer
development and the response to treatment, both dependent and
independent of p53 (8, 9).
Because overexpression of MDM2 in human cancers is
associated with a poor prognosis (10), MDM2 is considered to be
a target for human cancer therapy (11–13). To test this hypothesis,
we have developed a second generation of antisense oligonucleotides specifically targeting human MDM2. These oligonucleotides
have anticancer, chemosensitization, and radiosensitization effects
in vitro and in vivo in a wide range of human cancer models,
regardless of their p53 status (14–20).
Cancer prevention has been stressed increasingly because
human cancers are frequently at late stages and are incurable
when detected. Considering the role of MDM2 in the development
and treatment of cancer, we evaluated various dietary components
for inhibition of MDM2. Our initial studies identified genistein, an
isoflavone from soybeans, as having anticancer effects through
down-regulation of MDM2 expression (21). We have now found
that another dietary component reduces MDM2 levels in human
cancer cells.
Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a component of the spice
tumeric, has numerous medicinal properties and seems to be
useful in the prevention and treatment of cancer (22, 23). This
compound has the capacity to reduce proliferation of a variety of
malignant and normal cells; to induce apoptosis; and to suppress
tumor initiation, promotion, and metastasis. It also has antiangiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant properties. Although
inhibition of tyrosine kinases, sensitization to tumor necrosis
factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand–mediated apoptosis, and
other mechanisms have been implicated in the biological effects
of curcumin (22, 23), its primary molecular target and mechanism
of action remain to be clarified.
In the present study, we have shown that curcumin downregulates MDM2 expression in cells with either wild-type (WT) or
nonfunctional p53 and that this effect is at the transcriptional
level. MDM2 transcription is regulated by the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/erythroblastosis virus transcription factor 2 (ETS2) pathway, which is
modulated by curcumin. Further, curcumin has anticancer,
chemosensitization, and radiosensitization effects in human cancer
models in vitro and in vivo, independent of p53. Inhibition of
MDM2 expression seems to be important for these effects of
curcumin. Our studies help to elucidate the nature of regulation
of MDM2 expression and the mechanism by which curcumin
functions as an anticancer agent.

Curcumin Inhibits MDM2

Figure 1. Changes in expression of
MDM2 and related genes in cells exposed
to curcumin. A, PC3, LNCaP, MCF-7
(p53 +/+), and MCF-7 (p53 KD) cells were
exposed to various concentrations of
curcumin for 24 h, and target proteins
(MDM2, p21, Bcl2, E2F1, Bax, and h-actin)
were detected by immunoblotting with
specific antibodies. B, PC3 cells were
exposed to curcumin (15 Amol/L) for
various times, and the protein expression
levels of MDM2 and p21 were assessed.
C, PC3 cells were exposed to various
concentrations of curcumin for 24 h, and
the expression levels of various proteins
were assessed. D, human normal breast
cells, MCF10A, were exposed to various
concentrations of curcumin for 24 h, and
MDM2 and p21 levels were determined.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals, plasmids, animals, and cell culture. Curcumin and
gemcitabine were purchased from LKT Laboratories (St. Paul, MN) and
Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN), respectively. ( )-Deguelin, PD98059, rapamycin,
wortmannin, propidium iodide, and crystal violet were obtained from Sigma
(St. Louis, MO). ETS2 overexpression plasmids and control plasmids were
provided by Dr. D.K. Watson (Hollings Cancer Center, Charleston, SC;
ref. 24). ETS2 double-stranded small interfering RNA pool, control
nontargeting siRNA pool, and the transfection reagent DharmaFECT 1
were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). WT, constitutive-active,
and dominant-negative Akt vectors were gifts from Dr. A. Nicolin
(University of Milan, Milan, Italy; ref. 25). The control vector of Akt
expression plasmids, pUSEamp(+), was purchased from Upstate (Lake
Placid, NY). Male athymic nude mice (nu/nu), 4 to 6 weeks old, were
obtained from Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center
(Frederick, MD). Human prostate cancer PC3 cells were obtained from
the American Type Tissue Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and cultured
in Ham’s F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillinstreptomycin. Stable PC3 cell lines with MDM2 overexpression or
knockdown were described previously (21).
Reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), quantified by UV spectrophotometry, and used
to create cDNA with the SuperScript reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) kit
from Invitrogen. The PCR coamplification of MDM2 with h-actin was
accomplished by a method described previously (19).

Real-time quantitative PCR. Expression levels were determined using
an ABI 7900 Sequence Detection System as previously described (26). The
real-time quantitative PCR primers and fluorophore-labeled probe
(Hs00234753_m1) were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City,
CA). The sequence for the primers and probes for human S9 ribosomal have
been described previously (26). Expression levels were calculated using the
relative standard curve method (26). All reactions were run in triplicate, and
standard curves with correlation coefficients <0.98 were repeated. Control
reactions confirmed that no amplification occurred when yeast total RNA
was used as a template or when no-template-control reactions were done.
Luciferase assay. With the Renilla luciferase reporter as an internal
control, cells were cotransfected for 12 h with full-length or deleted human
MDM2 promoter vectors. The cells were then exposed to curcumin for 24 h.
The luciferase activity of the MDM2 promoter reporters was determined
with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. MDM2 reporter activity was normalized to that
for the Renilla luciferase reporter.
Assays for apoptosis, cell proliferation, and clonogenicity. The
methods used were described previously (19, 21).
Evaluation of curcumin as a chemotherapeutic, chemosensitizing,
and radiosensitizing agent in vivo. The PC3 xenograft model was
established by methods described previously (17, 19). Briefly, cultured cells
were washed with and resuspended in serum-free medium. Portions of the
suspension (5  106 cells in 0.2 mL) were injected into the left inguinal area
of nude mice. The mice were monitored by measuring tumor growth and
body weight and by general clinical observation (16, 19). Mice bearing

tumors of f100 mg were randomly divided into multiple treatment and
control groups ( five mice per group). Curcumin, dissolved in cottonseed oil,
was given by p.o. gavage at doses of 5 mg/d, 5 days per week for 4 weeks.
The control group received cottonseed oil only. Alone or in combination
with curcumin, gemcitabine (160 mg/kg) was given by i.p. injection on days
7, 14, and 21, and radiation (3 Gy) was administered on days 4, 6, and 10.
Tumor monitoring and body weight data were expressed as mean and SD of
tumor mass, and the significance between various treatment groups was
analyzed by ANOVA.

Results
Curcumin inhibits MDM2 expression in both normal and
cancerous human cell lines, independent of p53 activity. In the
PC3 human prostate cancer cell line, MDM2 levels were decreased
by curcumin in a dose-dependent (Fig. 1A) and time-dependent
(Fig. 1B) manner. Consistent with the idea that the activity was not
through p53, curcumin inhibited MDM2 in cell lines with either
WT p53 (LNCaP and MCF-7) or with p53 knockdown (p53 KD;
MCF-7 p53 KD; ref. 21; Fig. 1A). In addition, p21Waf1/CIP1 and Bax
were induced, whereas E2F1 and Bcl2 were decreased in PC3 cells,
likely as a result of MDM2 inhibition (Fig. 1C). These results are
similar to those observed with other MDM2 inhibitors (19, 21). The
inhibitory effect of curcumin on MDM2 was also noted in the
human normal breast cell line MCF10A (Fig. 1D).
Curcumin inhibits MDM2 through the transcription factor
ETS2 by modulation of the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway. The
expression of MDM2 mRNA in PC3 cells, measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR, was decreased by curcumin in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 2A1). The expression changes of the MDM2 gene were
also confirmed by real-time PCR (Fig. 2A2). There was, however,
no appreciable difference in MDM2 protein stability between PC3
cells exposed to curcumin and those exposed only to the solvent,
DMSO (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the p21 protein was stabilized,
probably as a result of MDM2 down-regulation (5, 6).
To establish how curcumin affects MDM2 transcription, a
human full-length MDM2 P2 promoter reporter (Luc01; ref. 27)
was transfected into PC3 cells. These cells were then exposed to
curcumin (15 Amol/L), which decreased the MDM2 transcriptional
activity (Fig. 2C1). This activity generally decreased with time of
exposure to curcumin (Fig. 2C2).
To characterize the curcumin-responsive element in the MDM2
promoter, a series of deletions of Luc01 (Fig. 2C3; ref. 27) were
evaluated. The shortest segment ( 132 to +33, Luc03) still retained
the capacity to respond to curcumin (Fig. 2C4). Interestingly,
Luc03 is the fragment that responds best to curcumin among

the MDM2 promoter fragments, suggesting that additional cis- or
trans- elements in the full-length MDM2 promoter modulate the
response of the MDM2 promoter to curcumin. There are several
response sites for transcription factors in this region of the MDM2
promoter, including those for ETS, activator protein-1 (AP1),
myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2), and nuclear factor for activated
T-cells (NFAT). The composite ETS/AP1 site is responsible for
activation of the promoter by growth factors dependent on the
ras–raf–extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)–
mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (27, 28).
To define the site involved in the effects of curcumin more
specifically, four luciferase vectors with ETSa, AP1, MEF2, and
NFAT mutations were transfected into PC3 cells, which were then
exposed to curcumin. Those with mutations at the MEF2 and
NFAT sites retained the capacity to respond to curcumin (Fig. 2C5).
Mutations at the AP1 and ETSa sites eliminated the response
of the promoter to curcumin, and a Luc01 promoter with a
mutation in the composite AP1/ETSa site was also not responsive
(Fig. 2C6).
The involvement of transcription factor ETS2 in the transcription of MDM2 and the inhibitory effects of curcumin on MDM2
expression were then confirmed. Curcumin inhibited ETS2
expression in PC3 cells in a concentration-dependent manner
(Fig. 2D1); overexpressed ETS2 resulted in the accumulation of
MDM2 (Fig. 2D2). Reconstituted ETS2 rescued MDM2 expression
in PC3 cells exposed to 15 Amol/L curcumin (Fig. 2D3). With
the highest concentration of curcumin (30 Amol/L), however, the
ectopically expressed ETS2 was reduced and, as a result, the
inhibition of MDM2 was not reversed (Fig. 2D3). To confirm this
observation, ETS2/control plasmid–transfected PC3 cells were
treated with curcumin (30 Amol/L) for a shorter period (3 h). As
shown, with the compensation of ETS2 expression, MDM2
inhibition by curcumin was reversed (Fig. 2D4). To further
establish the role of ETS2 in the curcumin-mediated MDM2
inhibition, ETS2 was transiently knocked down by doublestranded siRNA (Dharmacon; Fig. 2D5). Under these conditions,
curcumin did not down-regulate the MDM2 level any further
(Fig. 2D5).
Several signaling pathways activated by growth factors have
been implicated in the p53-independent regulation of MDM2
(27–34). To determine the mechanism(s) by which curcumin downregulates MDM2, PC3 cells were exposed to ( )-Deguelin, an
inhibitor of Akt; PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK; wortmannin, an
inhibitor of PI3K; or rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, for 60 min.
The cells were then exposed to curcumin for 24 h. Down-regulation

Figure 2. Curcumin down-regulates MDM2 transcription through the ETS2 transcription factor, independent of p53. A, PC3 cells were exposed to curcumin (0, 15,
or 30 Amol/L) for 24 h and then total RNA was extracted. MDM2 mRNA was coamplified with h-actin mRNA (A1) or quantified by real-time PCR (A2). B, PC3 cells were
exposed to curcumin or solvent (DMSO) followed by addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX , 10 Ag/mL). At selected times after cycloheximide
exposure, cell lysates were collected for determination of the MDM2 and p21 protein levels by immunoblotting. C, curcumin acts on the ETS2 site in the MDM2
promoter. C1, PC3 cells were transfected with the MDM2 P2 promoter luciferase construct, Luc01, or with the corresponding control vector, pGL3-Basic, for 12 h,
followed by incubation with curcumin (15 Amol/L) for an additional 24 h, at which time luciferase activities were measured. Columns, mean; bars, SD. C2, PC3

Curcumin Inhibits MDM2

of MDM2 was not affected by ( )-Deguelin or PD98059 (Fig. 3A1
and A2), suggesting that inhibition of Akt or MEK is not
responsible for the effect of curcumin on MDM2. Wortmannin
and rapamycin, inhibitors of PI3K or mTOR, the downstream target
of PI3K, however, eliminated the effects of curcumin on MDM2
expression (Fig. 3A3 and A4). The expression levels of p21 were not
greatly affected by either of the kinase inhibitors.
To evaluate the involvement of PI3K/mTOR in the activity of
curcumin, PC3 cells were pretreated with wortmannin or its
solvent (DMSO) followed by exposure to various concentrations
of curcumin. Curcumin inhibited PI3K activity, as manifested
by changes in the phosphorylation status of Akt (Fig. 3B1).
Pretreatment with wortmannin, however, blocked the effects of
curcumin on PI3K activity (Fig. 3B1). In contrast, curcumin had no
effects on the activities of MEK and c-Jun-NH2-kinase, as
represented by the phosphorylation status of ERK and c-Jun,
respectively (Fig. 3B1). Additionally, blocking the activity of PI3K
by wortmannin resulted in decreases in ETS2 and MDM2 (Fig. 3B2);
this effect was reversed by overexpression of ETS2 (Fig. 3B3).
Because wortmannin is not a specific PI3K inhibitor, a more
specific PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 (35), was included to confirm the
involvement of PI3K in MDM2 regulation. Similar to above results,
MDM2 inhibition by curcumin was abrogated by PI3K blockade
when PC3 cells were pretreated with various doses of LY294002
(Fig. 3B4). Consistently, blocking the activity of PI3K by LY294002
resulted in a decrease in MDM2 expression (Fig. 3B5). The ensuing
knockdown experiment in PC3 cells suggested that the downstream target of PI3K responsible for regulating MDM2 expression
is ETS2 (Fig. 3B6).
To confirm that Akt was not involved in the MDM2 regulation,
WT, constitutively active, and dominant-negative Akt were overexpressed in PC3 cells; no appreciable changes in MDM2 expression were evident (Fig. 3C1). Consistently, overexpression of WT,
constitutively active, or dominant-negative Akt did not reverse the
effects of curcumin in inhibiting MDM2 expression (Fig. 3C2).
Similarly, short time exposure (4 h) of dominant-negative Akt–
transfected PC3 cells to curcumin resulted in apparent MDM2
down-regulation.
In contrast, inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin decreased cellular
levels of ETS2 and MDM2 (Fig. 3D1), and the blockade of mTOR
by pretreatment of PC3 cells with rapamycin abrogated MDM2
down-regulation resulting from LY294002 treatment (Fig. 3D2).
Similarly, a knockdown experiment indicated that ETS2 was the
downstream mediator of rapamycin in its inhibition of MDM2
expression (Fig. 3D3).
The p53-independent anticancer effects of curcumin are
related to MDM2. Control PC3 cells, PC3 cells with stable
knockdown of MDM2, PC3 cells with stable overexpression of
MDM2, or cells exposed to the corresponding control vector
(pCMV) were incubated with curcumin (0, 15, or 30 Amol/L) for
24 h followed by immunoblotting for MDM2, p21, and h-actin
(Fig. 4A). In control cells, curcumin decreased the expression of
MDM2; this effect was blocked in PC3 cells with MDM2 overexpression. In all cells exposed to curcumin, there was increased
expression of p21.
Curcumin reduced viability (Fig. 4B) and proliferation (Fig. 4B)
of PC3 cells in a dose-dependent manner. It also induced
apoptosis (Fig. 4B) and reduced the surviving fraction of cells
(Fig. 4B). Cells with MDM2 knockdown or overexpression,
however, were less susceptible to the anticancer effects of
curcumin than control cells.

Curcumin sensitizes human cancer cells to chemotherapy
and radiation through MDM2, independent of p53. PC3 cells
were exposed to 0 or 15 Amol/L of curcumin for 24 h followed by
exposure to 10 Gy of g-irradiation. Although levels of MDM2 were
decreased initially after irradiation, the expression of MDM2 was
increased in later time points (Fig. 5A). This irradiation-related
increase of MDM2 was blocked by curcumin (Fig. 5A). Likely
resulting from the inhibition of MDM2, combining curcumin and
irradiation had potent effects on the expression of p21, Bax, and
E2F1 proteins (Fig. 5A). Similar results have been observed in
studies with other MDM2 inhibitors, such as MDM2 antisense
oligonucleotides (19, 20) and genistein (21).
In separate studies, control PC3 cells and PC3 cells with MDM2
knockdown or overexpression were exposed to curcumin (5 Amol/L)
for 24 h, then irradiated with various doses of radiation (0, 5, or
10 Gy). Combining curcumin and irradiation led to lower viability

overexpression (OE ) of MDM2 were exposed to various concentrations of
curcumin for 24 h followed by Western blot analyses for MDM2, p21, and h-actin.
B, the stable PC3 cell lines were exposed to various concentrations of curcumin
for 48 h followed by MTT assay for cell viability, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation
assay for cell proliferation, and apoptosis assay or clonogenic assay.

compared with cells exposed to irradiation alone (Fig. 5B and C).
Cells with MDM2 overexpression or knockdown were less sensitive
to the effects of curcumin and radiation (Fig. 5B and C).
To evaluate the possible chemosensitization effects of curcumin, PC3 cells were incubated with various concentrations of
curcumin for 24 h and then exposed to gemcitabine for an
additional 24 h. In accordance with the previous studies, 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assays showed that curcumin (1 or 5 Amol/L) plus gemcitabine
had more potent cytotoxic effects than gemcitabine or curcumin
alone (Fig. 5D).
When administered by p.o. gavage to tumor-bearing nude mice,
curcumin (5 mg/d) inhibited the growth of PC3 xenografts by
f50% (Fig. 6A and B). Curcumin also enhanced the antitumor
effects of gemcitabine (Fig. 6A) and irradiation (Fig. 6B). Analysis of
tumors collected at the end of the experiment showed that
curcumin reduced the expression of MDM2 in xenografts treated
with curcumin alone, and in xenografts treated with combinations
of curcumin plus gemcitabine or irradiation (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
Our observations suggest that a novel signaling pathway, PI3K/
mTOR/ETS2, regulates MDM2 transcription, independent of p53.
Although MDM2 is transactivated by p53 and regulates p53 (1), the
mechanism by which MDM2 expression is regulated independent
of p53 is not clear. Because overexpression of MDM2 is observed

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

in human cancers and is related to a poor prognosis (10), and >50%
of human cancers harbor nonfunctional p53, the mechanism by
which MDM2 is regulated in the absence of p53 needs to be
defined. Our finding that PI3K/mTOR/ETS2 signaling is involved in
MDM2 regulation has implications for carcinogenesis and cancer
progression. First, the described p53-independent up-regulation
of MDM2 by growth factors through PI3K may result in p53
repression; this process could be a critical step in tumorigenesis.
Moreover, in the majority of human cancers, mutant p53 is present
at high levels and is incapable of transactivating MDM2. Under
these circumstances, p53-independent pathways regulate the
expression of MDM2.
PI3K-mediated signaling is one of the most frequently targeted
pathways in human cancers (36). Activated PI3K promotes cell
survival and proliferation through mechanisms that are not fully
understood (36). mTOR, a highly conserved serine/threonine
kinase activated by PI3K, is involved in cancer initiation and
progression (37). Again, the mechanisms are not clear. PI3K/Akt
has been implicated in MDM2 protein stabilization and subcellular
localization (29, 33, 34). Here, we provide evidence that PI3K
induces MDM2 transcription through mTOR/ETS2, suggesting that
these proteins may govern the mechanisms by which mitogens
promote cell proliferation and inactivate p53. Because MDM2 is
tumorigenic even in the absence of p53, the presented results
provide a mechanism by which mitogens promote cancer
progression independent of functional p53. Moreover, our findings
could facilitate development of more rational and effective therapy

Curcumin Inhibits MDM2

for human cancers. A remaining concern is the fact that cells have
redundant mechanisms for PI3K-mediated regulation of MDM2.
This can be explained by the Akt-mTOR feedback loop (37). In
this loop, activated Akt leads to stabilized MDM2 and activated
mTOR, which, in turn, inhibits Akt. Thus, the level of MDM2 would
decrease over time if mTOR were incapable of inducing MDM2 upregulation. Future studies clarifying the differential regulation of
Akt and mTOR with respect to MDM2 would be informative.
Although we have shown that the transcription factor ETS2 is
important for MDM2 transcription, the involvement of other ETS
family members cannot be excluded. For example, ETS transcription factor Fli-1 regulates MDM2 transcription (38). The
transcription of the MDM2 P2 promoter through the composite
AP1-ETS responsive site requires the cooperation of both
activated members of the AP1 and ETS families. These families
have multiple members, which form heterodimers with other
family members. Further studies are needed to determine
whether other members, in addition to ETS2 and Fli-1, are
capable of up-regulating MDM2. Results of such studies would
help in understanding the p53-independent regulation of MDM2
expression.
In rodent model systems, curcumin, a dietary component,
inhibits the formation of carcinogen-induced cancers of the colon
(39), oral cavity (40), forestomach (41), esophagus (42), stomach
(43), lung (44), liver (45), and skin (46). In a small clinical study, p.o.
administered curcumin had beneficial effects on several types of
premalignant lesions (47). Although several oncogenes and tumor

suppressors have been suggested to be modulated by curcumin
(22, 23), the main cellular target(s) of curcumin is not known. Our
present study identified a novel activity of curcumin, inhibition of
MDM2 expression.
MDM2 has been suggested as a drug target for human cancer
therapy (14–20). To target MDM2, we have generated a secondgeneration antisense oligonucleotide that showed effective and
efficient knockdown of MDM2 in vitro and in vivo. This inhibition
of MDM2 led to substantial in vitro and in vivo activity against
human cancer cells and tumors (14–20). In our continuing search
for MDM2 inhibitors, we have found that genistein, a component of
soybeans, inhibits MDM2 expression, and this inhibition is at least
partially responsible for the anticancer activities of genistein (21).
We now show that another dietary component with antitumor
activity, curcumin, down-regulates MDM2. This compound has
entered clinical trials for certain human cancers (47, 48). Our
studies help to elucidate the mechanism by which curcumin acts as
an anticancer agent and thus substantiates the role of curcumin in
cancer therapy. Future studies focused on the structure-activity
relationship of known MDM2-inhibiting compounds, including
genistein and curcumin, could allow for development of more
potent molecules for cancer therapy.
In conclusion, our observations support the finding that PI3K/
mTOR/ETS2 is a previously unrecognized pathway, leading to upregulation of MDM2 transcription (Fig. 6D). Considering the
numerous activities of MDM2 in cancer growth and progression,
we propose that curcumin can be used as a therapeutic agent,

Figure 6. In vivo antitumor activity of
curcumin administered alone or in
combination with gemcitabine (A) or
radiation (B ) to nude mice bearing PC3
xenografts, and a simplistic model for
MDM2 regulation through the PI3K/mTOR/
ETS2 pathway, which is modulated by
curcumin (D). Curcumin treatment (5 mg/d
by p.o. gavage) was initiated on day 0 and
continued 5 d/wk for 4 wk. The mice were
dosed with gemcitabine (160 mg/kg) i.p.
on days 7, 14, and 21; radiation (RT; 3 Gy)
was administered on days 4, 6, and 10.
C, at the end of the experiment, tumors
were removed and proteins (MDM2 and
h-actin) present in tumor homogenates
were measured by immunoblotting. D1,
growth factors activate ETS2 through PI3K
and mTOR. Activated ETS2 transactivates
the MDM2 gene, the products of which
promote cell proliferation and/or inhibit
apoptosis through both p53-dependent and
p53-independent pathways. D2, curcumin
down-regulates MDM2 expression by
acting on PI3K, which leads to inhibition of
cell proliferation and/or apoptosis.
