Abstract
The C-28 methyl ester of the oleane triterpenoid 2-cyano-3,12dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO-Me) induces apoptosis of human cancer cells by disrupting redox balance and is in
clinical trials. CDDO-Me contains A,B-unsaturated carbonyl
groups that form reversible adducts with thiol nucleophiles.
The present studies show that CDDO-Me blocks interleukin-6
(IL-6)–induced and constitutive activation of the Janusactivated kinase 1 (JAK1) in cells. In support of a direct
mechanism, CDDO-Me forms adducts with JAK1 at Cys1077 in
the kinase domain and inhibits JAK1 activity. In concert with
these results, CDDO-Me blocked IL-6–induced and constitutive
activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
(STAT3). Moreover, we show that CDDO-Me (a) binds directly
to STAT3 by a mechanism dependent on the alkylation of
Cys259 and (b) inhibits the formation of STAT3 dimers. These
findings indicate that CDDO-Me inhibits activation of the
JAK1!STAT3 pathway by forming adducts with both JAK1 and
STAT3. [Cancer Res 2008;68(8):2920–6]

Introduction
The synthetic oleanane triterpenoids are a new class of agents
that have antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity (1). One of the
synthetic oleanane triterpenoids, C-28 methyl ester of 2-cyano-3,12dioxooleana-1,9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO-Me), is under study in
phase I and II clinical trials for the treatment of patients with
hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. In this regard, CDDOMe and other derivatives with modifications at the C-28 position
induce apoptosis of human myeloid leukemia (2–6), multiple
myeloma (7–9), osteosarcoma (10), lung cancer (11, 12), breast
cancer (13, 14), and pancreatic cancer (15). The synthetic oleanane
triterpenoids activate the phase II response of cells at low
nanomolar concentrations and thereby protect against oxidative
stress by decreasing levels of reactive oxygen species (1). By
contrast, at low micromolar concentrations, CDDO-Me and related
derivatives induce apoptosis in vitro by increasing reactive oxygen
species and decreasing intracellular glutathione (5, 7, 15, 16). How
the synthetic oleanane triterpenoids disrupt redox balance and
induce apoptosis at low micromolar concentrations is not known.
However, structure-activity analysis has shown that a,h-unsaturated carbonyl groups on rings A and C confer Michael addition with
a nucleophilic target (17, 18). In this context, nuclear factor nB
activates the transcription of diverse genes that regulate cell

survival (19), and CDDO directly inhibits the InB kinase h and
thereby the nuclear factor-nB pathway by interacting with Cys179 in
the InB kinase h activation loop (20, 21). These findings have
indicated that CDDO-Me induces apoptosis, in part, by alkylating
critical cysteines in proteins that regulate survival.
Members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription
(STAT) family of transcription factors have, like nuclear factor nB,
been implicated in transformation, tumor cell survival, invasion,
and metastasis (22). Activation of STAT3, in particular, has been
detected in diverse hematologic malignancies and solid tumors
(22–24) and induces transformation (25). STAT3 is also constitutively activated in immune cells in the tumor microenvironment
(26). STAT3 is activated by Janus-activated kinase ( JAK)-1
phosphorylation of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor, recruitment
of STAT3, and, in turn, phosphorylation of STAT3 (27). STAT3 then
forms dimers that translocate to the nucleus and activate STAT3
target genes, which encode regulators of cell cycle progression
(cyclin D1 and c-Myc) and inhibitors of apoptosis (survivin and
Bcl-xL; refs. 28, 29). The pattern of STAT3-induced gene expression
is regulated by diverse signals that converge on JAK1 and STAT3
(27), indicating that both proteins are targets for inhibiting this
pathway. Importantly, small-molecule inhibitors of the STAT3
pathway are effective as anticancer agents in vitro and in animal
models (30, 31). Other studies have shown that the triterpenoids
decrease pSTAT3 levels (9, 32, 33); however, the mechanistic basis
for this response is not known.
The present results show that CDDO-Me directly inhibits IL-6–
induced and constitutive JAK1 activity. The results also show that
CDDO-Me directly blocks STAT3 signaling and the induction of
growth and survival genes.

analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.
Binding of CDDO-Me-biotin to JAK1 and STAT3. CDDO-Me and

addition of streptavidin-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) for 1 h.
Alternatively, intact cells were pretreated with CDDO-Me for 2 h and then

to immunoblotting with anti-JAK1 or anti-STAT3. In other studies,
recombinant GST-JAK1 kinase domain (KD; amino acids 870–1,152), GSTSTAT3 or GST-JAK1-KD(C1077A), and GST-STAT3(C259A), generated by
site-directed mutagenesis, were cleaved with thrombin to remove the GST
moiety. The purified JAK1-KD and STAT3 proteins were incubated with

CDDO-Me inhibits JAK1 activity. To determine whether
CDDO-Me affects JAK signaling, we first studied HeLa cells that
were stimulated with IL-6. Phospho-JAK1 levels were low to
undetectable in control HeLa cells and were increased with IL-6
stimulation (Fig. 1A). Notably, treatment of the HeLa cells with
CDDO-Me suppressed IL-6–induced JAK1 activation (Fig. 1A). IL-6
stimulation was also associated with increases in phospho-JAK2
levels (Fig. 1B). However, in contrast to JAK1, CDDO-Me treatment
had no apparent effect on JAK2 activation (Fig. 1B). There was no
detectable activation of JAK3 in the IL-6–stimulated HeLa cells
(data not shown). In contrast to HeLa cells, JAK1 is constitutively
activated in human MDA-MB-468 cells (Fig. 1C). Treatment of
MDA-MB-468 cells with CDDO-Me was associated with downregulation of phospho-JAK1 levels (Fig. 1C). Moreover, the effect of
CDDO-Me on phospho-JAK1 was detectable within 2 hours of
treatment (Fig. 1D). These findings indicate that CDDO-Me inhibits
JAK1, but not JAK2, activation.
CDDO-Me interacts directly with JAK1. To further assess the
effects of CDDO-Me, we immunoprecipitated JAK1 from control
and IL-6–stimulated HeLa cells and performed in vitro kinase
assays with GST-STAT3 as substrate. IL-6 stimulation was associated with increases in JAK1-mediated phosphorylation of STAT3
(Fig. 2A, left). However, addition of CDDO-Me to the reactions
blocked STAT3 phosphorylation, indicating that CDDO-Me directly
blocks JAK1 activity (Fig. 2A, left). In vitro kinase assays with
constitutively activated JAK1 immunoprecipitated from MDA-MB468 breast cancer cells also showed that addition of CDDO-Me
to the reactions blocks JAK1-mediated phosphorylation of STAT3
(Fig. 2A, right). To confirm these findings, we expressed GFP-tagged
JAK1 in MDA-MB-468 cells. Analysis of anti-GFP precipitates
showed that phosphorylation of GST-STAT3 is inhibited by CDDOMe (Fig. 2B). To determine whether CDDO-Me interacts with JAK1,
lysates from HeLa cells were incubated with CDDO-Me conjugated
to biotin. Analysis of the adsorbates by immunoblotting with antiJAK1 showed binding to CDDO-Me and not biotin (Fig. 2C, left). By
contrast, there was no detectable binding of CDDO-Me to JAK2
(Fig. 2C, left). Incubation of intact MDA-MB-468 cells showed
binding of JAK1 to CDDO-Me-biotin and not biotin (Fig. 2C, right).
In addition, pretreatment of intact cells with CDDO-Me competitively blocked binding of JAK1 to CDDO-Me-biotin (Fig. 2C, right).
JAK1 contains a cysteine residue at position 1077 in the kinase
domain that is not present in JAK2. Binding of CDDO-Me-biotin
was detectable with purified recombinant JAK1-KD (Fig. 2D). By
contrast, the formation of adducts was substantially decreased
when recombinant JAK1-KD mutated at Cys1077 was incubated
with CDDO-Me-biotin (Fig. 2D). These findings indicate that
CDDO-Me interacts directly with JAK1 on Cys1077 and inhibits JAK1
activity.
CDDO-Me inhibits the IL-6–induced STAT3 pathway. JAK1
phosphorylates and thereby activates STAT3 for targeting to the
nucleus (22, 27). In this context, IL-6 stimulation of HeLa cells was
associated with increases in phospho-STAT3 levels (Fig. 3A).
Treatment of the HeLa cells with CDDO-Me blocked IL-6–induced
phospho-STAT3 (Fig. 3A). In addition, CDDO-Me blocked IL-6–
induced targeting of STAT3 to the nucleus (Fig. 3B). Transfection of
HeLa cells with a pSTAT3-luciferase (Luc) reporter showed that IL-6

stimulates STAT3-mediated transcription and that CDDO-Me inhibits this response (Fig. 3C). STAT3 activates transcription of the
cyclin D1 and survivin genes. Consistent with inhibition of STAT3mediated transcription, IL-6–induced increases in cyclin D and survivin expression were inhibited by CDDO-Me treatment (Fig. 3D).
These results and our findings with JAK1 indicate that CDDO-Me
blocks IL-6–induced activation of the JAK1!STAT3 pathway.
CDDO-Me blocks constitutive activation of the JAK1!STAT3
pathway. The JAK1!STAT3 pathway is constitutively activated in
MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells (37). Consistent with the results
obtained in IL-6–stimulated HeLa cells, treatment of MDA-MB-468
cells with CDDO-Me down-regulated constitutive phosphorylation
of STAT3 (Fig. 4A, left). Analysis of the kinetics of this response
showed decreases in phospho-STAT3 levels within 2 hours of
CDDO-Me treatment (Fig. 4A, right). Furthermore, CDDO-Me
inhibited the constitutive nuclear localization of STAT3 in MDAMB-468 cells (Fig. 4B). Constitutive activation of the pSTAT3-Luc
reporter was inhibited by CDDO-Me (Fig. 4C). In addition, CDDOMe treatment was associated with down-regulation of cyclin D1
and survivin expression (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that
CDDO-Me blocks constitutive activation of the JAK1!STAT3
pathway in MDA-MB-468 cells.
CDDO-Me blocks STAT3 dimerization. JAK1-mediated phosphorylation of STAT3 is associated with the targeting of phosphoSTAT3 dimers to the nucleus for activation of STAT3-dependent
genes. Thus, IL-6 stimulation of HeLa cells results in the formation
of STAT3 dimers (Fig. 5A). To determine if CDDO-Me affects STAT3
dimerization, lysates from IL-6–stimulated HeLa cells were
incubated with CDDO-Me. The results show that CDDO-Me disrupts the STAT3 dimers (Fig. 5A). Constitutive STAT3 dimerization

in MDA-MB-468 cells was also disrupted by CDDO-Me (Fig. 5B). To
confirm these results, we transfected MDA-MB-468 cells with HAtagged STAT3 (HA-STAT3) and Flag-tagged STAT3 (Flag-STAT3).
Immunoblot analysis of anti-HA precipitates with anti-Flag showed
the formation of Flag-STAT3-HA-STAT3 dimers (Fig. 5C). Moreover,
incubation of the anti-HA precipitates with CDDO-Me resulted in
disruption of the Flag-STAT-HA-STAT3 dimers (Fig. 5C). These
results indicate that CDDO-Me blocks STAT3 dimerization.
CDDO-Me forms adducts with STAT3 that are dependent on
Cys259. Incubation of HeLa cell lysates with CDDO-Me-biotin
showed that CDDO-Me forms complexes with STAT3 (Fig. 6A, left).
Incubation of intact MDA-MB-468 cells showed binding of STAT3
to CDDO-Me-biotin and not biotin (Fig. 6A, right). In addition,
pretreatment of intact MDA-MB-468 cells with different concentrations of CDDO-Me showed inhibition of the binding of CDDOMe-biotin to STAT3 (Fig. 6A, right). We also incubated recombinant
STAT3 with CDDO-Me-biotin. Analysis of the adsorbates with antiSTAT3 showed that CDDO-Me interacts directly with STAT3
(Fig. 6B). The parent compound CDDO similarly formed direct
complexes with recombinant STAT3 (Fig. 6B). By contrast, the
interaction was blocked when recombinant STAT3(C259A) was
incubated with CDDO-Me-biotin (Fig. 6C). These findings indicate
that CDDO-Me inhibits STAT3 by direct alkylation of Cys259.

Discussion
The synthetic oleanane triterpenoids disrupt redox balance and
thereby induce apoptosis at low micromolar concentrations (5, 7,
15, 16). The mechanism(s) responsible for such activity remain
unclear. However, certain insights are being obtained from the

findings that the synthetic oleanane triterpenoids can confer
Michael addition with nucleophilic targets (17, 18). In this regard, a
direct interaction of a synthetic oleanane triterpenoid was found
spectroscopically with thiol groups of the Keap1 sensor (18).
Subsequent studies have shown that CDDO and its C-28 derivatives
interact directly with InB kinase h at Cys179 in the activation loop
(20, 21). Otherwise, to our knowledge, there are no reports of CDDO
or its derivatives forming adducts with other protein targets. The
cyclopentenone prostaglandins also contain an a,h-unsaturated
carbonyl moiety and react with the InB kinase h Cys179 residue (38).
However, few targets of the cyclopentenone prostaglandins have
been identified to date, even when using an unbiased proteomic
approach (39). Nonetheless, the findings that the cyclopentenone
prostaglandins react with H-Ras (40), heat shock protein 90 (39),
and estrogen receptor a (41) provide potential leads for additional
targets of the synthetic oleanane triterpenoids.
Constitutive activation of STAT3 contributes to tumorigenesis by
promoting proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis (42). Tyrosine
phosphorylation of STAT3 confers dimerization through binding of
the SH2 domain of one monomer to a P-pY-LKTK motif on the
other STAT3 monomer (31, 43–45). The present results show that
CDDO-Me inhibits IL-6–induced and constitutive JAK1 activity.
The results support a model in which CDDO-Me binds directly to
JAK1 at Cys1077 in the kinase domain and thereby blocks JAK1 as an
upstream effector of STAT3 phosphorylation (Fig. 6D). The triterpenoids have been shown to decrease pSTAT3 levels (9, 32, 33)
and the present findings show that this response is associated with
the direct inhibition of JAK1.
Dimerization of STAT3 is necessary for its activation and
oncogenic function (25). STAT3 target genes confer diverse

processes of transformation, including proliferation, apoptosis,
angiogenesis, and metastasis (46). In this regard, agents that
inhibit STAT3 dimerization and activation exhibit antitumor
activity (30, 31). Previous studies have shown that STAT3
dimerization is also mediated by interchain disulfide bridging
involving Cys259 (37). Notably, the present results show that
CDDO-Me disrupts STAT3 dimers. Moreover, we show that
CDDO-Me binds directly to STAT3 by forming adducts with
Cys259 (Fig. 6D). Thus, CDDO-Me–mediated disruption of STAT3
dimerization is consistent with alkylation of Cys259 and thereby
loss of interchain bridging. CDDO-Me treatment was also
associated with down-regulation of cyclin D1 and survivin, both
encoded by STAT3 target genes. Notably, the inhibition of JAK1
would be sufficient to decrease STAT3 phosphorylation and
dimerization. However, the results also show that CDDO-Me
directly inhibits STAT3. These findings thus collectively indicate
that CDDO-Me blocks the JAK1!STAT3 pathway by directly
inhibiting both JAK1 and STAT3 (Fig. 6D).
