BACKGROUND: We recently reported that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g agonists target chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML) quiescent stem cells in vitro by decreasing transcription of STAT5. Here in the ACTIM phase 2 clinical trial, we asked whether
pioglitazone add-on therapy to imatinib would impact CML residual disease, as assessed by BCR-ABL1 transcript quantification.
METHODS: CML patients were eligible if treated with imatinib for at least 2 years at a stable daily dose, having yielded major molecular response (MMR) but not having achieved molecular response 4.5 (MR4.5) defined by BCR-ABL1/ABL1IS RNA levels  0.0032%. After
inclusion, patients started pioglitazone at a dosage of 30 to 45 mg/day in addition to imatinib. The primary objective was to evaluate
the cumulative incidence of patients having progressed from MMR to MR4.5 over 12 months. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were included (age range, 24-79 years). No pharmacological interaction was observed between the drugs. The main adverse events were
weight gain in 12 patients and a mean decrease of 0.4 g/dL in hemoglobin concentration. The cumulative incidence of MR4.5 was 56%
(95% confidence interval, 37%-76%) by 12 months, despite a wide range of therapy duration (1.9-15.5 months), and 88% of 17 evaluable
patients who were still on imatinib reached MR4.5 by 48 months. The cumulative incidence of MMR to MR4.5 spontaneous conversions
over 12 months was estimated to be 23% with imatinib alone in a parallel cohort of patients. CONCLUSION: Pioglitazone in combination with imatinib was well tolerated and yielded a favorable 56% rate. These results provide a proof of concept needing confirmation

INTRODUCTION
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder associated with the t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) translocation and
its cytogenetic hallmark, the Philadelphia chromosome (der22). This translocation results in a BCR-ABL1 fusion gene that
codes for a BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein (p210BCR-ABL) with enhanced tyrosine kinase activity. BCR-ABL1 is present in all cells
of the leukemic clone, including leukemic hematopoietic stem cells.1 The ability of BCR-ABL1 to induce a similar disease in
mice resulted in the design of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), a new class of anticancer agents, the first of which was

imatinib (Gleevec, Novartis Pharmaceuticals).2 Efficacy
and tolerability were determined in the phase 3 IRIS trial,3
and 15 years later, the long-term survival rate of CML
patients in chronic phase receiving continuous TKI therapy
closely matches that of the non-CML population.4
Residual disease in CML patients is detected by
quantifying the BCR-ABL1 transcripts (BCR-ABL1/
ABL1) by way of real-time quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (RTQ-PCR).5 Definitions of molecular
responses have evolved over the years. Molecular response
4.5 (MR4.5) corresponds to a 4.5-log reduction from a
standardized baseline (BCR-ABL1/ABL1  0.0032% on
the International Scale) and represents a reproducible assessment of deep molecular response. Residual CML disease remains detectable above the level of MR4.5 in 40%
to 90% of patients in spite of sustained imatinib therapy.6
Patients achieving stable and durable MR4.5 may participate in treatment free remission studies. In that patient
population, discontinuation of imatinib resulted in molecular relapse in 40% to 60% of patients, depending on
the chosen definition of molecular relapse.7-9 Although
their clinical significance is unclear, BCR-ABL1 positive
progenitor cells are found in virtually all patients treated
with imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib, emphasizing the
need to target and control the residual CML stem cell
pool in an effort to eradicate the disease.10-14
We reported recently that peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor (PPAR)-c agonists, including the drug
pioglitazone, are capable of eroding the CML leukemia
stem cell pool in biological assays and 3 anecdotal clinical
cases treated for associated type 2 diabetes or off-label.15
PPAR-c agonists are currently used as antidiabetic drugs
that are not hypoglycemogenic in healthy individuals.
Whereas CML stem cells in quiescence resist TKI toxicity,
pioglitazone is capable of pulling them out quiescence,
thereby sensitizing them to imatinib toxicity.15 To evaluate
the potential therapeutic value of PPAR-c agonists in
CML, we initiated a proof of concept phase 2 study termed
ACTIM (actos 1 imatinib) to score the cumulative incidence of progression from major molecular response
(MMR) to MR4.5 over 12 months in CML patients who
were given pioglitazone in addition to imatinib.

with no dose modification within the last 3 months, and
3) in MMR, defined by BCR-ABL1/ABL1IS  0.1% without MR4.5 at study initiation (see detailed methods in the
Supporting Information).
The planned therapy consisted in the continuation of
imatinib at the same daily dose per patient (400 mg to
800 mg) with the addition of pioglitazone 30 mg/d during
the first 2 months and 45 mg/d thereafter. The study was
amended in June 2011 in order to limit the duration of
pioglitazone therapy to 12 months and to stop recruitment
after completion of the first step of the study. This amendment was requested by the French health regulatory agency
(ANSM) after their decision to withdraw pioglitazone
from market on the basis of results of epidemiologic studies that suggested an increased risk of bladder carcinoma in
patients with diabetes who have had long-term exposure to
pioglitazone, although ANSM had granted us a special authorization to continue pioglitazone for ACTIM.16,17
Response Definition and Primary Endpoint

The primary endpoint, referred to hereafter as the
“molecular response,” was the percentage of patients
achieving MR4.5 by 12 months at 1 or more scheduled
determinations, as defined by a BCR-ABL1/ABL1 ratio
of  0.0032% on the International Scale according to the
European Leukemia Net recommendations for minimal
residual disease quantification.18 Polymerase chain reaction analysis was centralized at study entry and then molecular assessments were performed in hospital
laboratories of the French Quality Control Network for
BCR-ABL1 Quantification (Groupe de Biologie Moleculaire des Hemopathies Malignes).
Biomarker Analyses and Secondary Endpoints

Secondary endpoints included 1) safety and efficacy analyses at different time points, 2) measurement of STAT5
RNA levels, and 3) colony-forming cell (CFC) assays before and during the study (months 6 and 12) (see detailed
methods in the Supporting Information). Measurement
of BCR-ABL1/ABL1IS RNA levels was performed every 2
months during the 12 months of study. One patient was
lost from follow-up after the study period, and long-term
follow-up data were collected.

was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method and conducted on an intent-to-treat principle. Additional sensitivity analyses at different time points were then added.
Secondary endpoints regarding patient characteristics and biomarker evolution over time were investigated
with the use of paired-sample tests. Cumulative incidences of molecular response rate within subgroups were estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method and compared
using the Wilcoxon test. Confidence intervals were estimated at the 95% confidence level, and 2-sided P values < .05 were considered to indicate statistical
significance. Statistical analyses were performed using
SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NJ) and R (The R
Foundation for Statistical Computing).

was already in MR4.5 at the screening visit, 1 patient was
not in MMR, and 1 patient withdrew consent. None of
these patients received pioglitazone. Twenty-four patients
were eligible and evaluable (Fig. 1) and were classified on
the basis of age, sex ratio, Sokal risk score,19 time since diagnosis, and quantitative criteria of imatinib therapy (Table 1). Fourteen patients were in MMR without achieving
MR4 (58%) and 10 patients were in MR4 without achieving MR4.5 (42%). Of note, 12 patients were treated with
imatinib more than 400 mg/d at inclusion reflecting previous dose adaptations. All these patients were in stable response before inclusion and did not achieved MR4.5
previously.
Pioglitazone Administration

All eligible patients started pioglitazone at a dosage of
30 mg/d and increased the dose to 45 mg/d after 2 months
of therapy. A total of 9 patients (37.5%) discontinued
pioglitazone before month 12. Eight of them did so because their physician–investigator decided to stop pioglitazone administration after France’s ANSM issued a

All patients were monitored with bladder ultrasonography every 6 months during the study period and every 12 months thereafter. No case of bladder carcinoma
was reported. Only 1 grade 3 adverse event was recorded
(hypokalemia). As expected, no episode of hypoglycemia
was recorded. HbA1C and total cholesterol levels were
not modified during the 12-month follow-up (Supporting Table 1). Overall, weight was stable over time (median, 81.5 kg at inclusion vs 82 kg at month 12, P 5 .27
[paired t test]), although 12 patients experienced a weight
gain (grade 1). One patient stopped because of G2 edema.
Compared with baseline adverse events before pioglitazone initiation, no significant increase in other adverse
events was observed (Supporting Table 2).

report of a possible increased risk of bladder carcinoma.
Despite this early termination of pioglitazone, 5 patients
achieved MR4.5 during the 12-month follow-up period.
The first 2 patients included in the study received pioglitazone for longer than 12 months (14.5 and 15.5 months)
before the limitation of pioglitazone treatment duration
to 12 months. As a result, the median duration of pioglitazone therapy was 11.2 months (range, 1.9-15.5 months).
The median cumulative dose of pioglitazone for each patient was 13,957 mg (range, 1710-19,815 mg), which corresponds to a median daily dose of 40 mg; dosage
intensity during the 12-month follow-up period for all
patients was 32 mg/d (Table 1). No patient had to reduce
the dosage of imatinib during the study. Levels of imatinib were not statistically different at inclusion (median
dosage, 890 ng/mL [range, 437-2436 ng/mL]) and after 1
month of combined therapy (median dosage, 846 ng/mL
[range, 395-2665 ng/mL]; P 5 .46).

Molecular efficacy

Thirteen patients (54%) achieved MR4.5 during the 12month follow-up period (Table 2). Out of the13 patients
in MMR and not in MR4, 4 (30.7%) achieved MR4.5 by
12 months. The estimated cumulative incidence of molecular response was 56% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3776) by 12 months (3 nonresponding patients were evaluated at month 11) (Fig. 2A). Early discontinuation of pioglitazone was not considered a competitive event for
molecular response achievement. At 12 months, 7 patients
(29.1%) remained in MR4.5, whereas 6 patients presented
fluctuations of the BCR-ABL1 transcript around the level
of MR4.5 before they stabilized (Table 2). Twenty-three
out of 24 eligible patients were followed in the long term
(median follow-up period, 5.1 years [range, 4.5-5.8 years]).
One patient aged 66 years died from multiple myeloma diagnosed after CML 4.5 years after inclusion. At 48 months
since inclusion, 14 patients (58.3%) continued to be in
MR4.5. Focusing on the 17 patients who were evaluable
during the follow-up period and who were never switched
to another TKI, most of the 12-month nonresponders
were able to reach molecular response after the study, so
that 15 of those 17 evaluable patients (88.2%) reached
MR4.5 by 48 months after pioglitazone priming.

Safety

Exploratory analyses were conducted on safety data. A
modest decrease in the median value of hemoglobin concentration was observed between inclusion and month 12
(12 g/dL [range, 9.3-14.7 g/dL] vs 11.6 g/dL [range, 9.315.1 g/dL]; P 5 .03 [paired t test]). The median neutrophil and platelet counts were not different at inclusion
compared with month 12 (neutrophils, 2.6 giga/L vs 2.7
giga/L; P 5 .11 [paired t test]; platelets, 209 giga/L vs 218
giga/L; P 5 .72 [paired t test]).

Estimation of MMR to MR4.5 conversion rates with
imatinib alone

Although without the probative value of prospective studies, we estimated the spontaneous rate of MMR to MR4.5
conversions in a parallel cohort of CML patients not included in the ACTIM trial with similar characteristics
(Supporting Table 3). The cumulative incidence of
MR4.5 conversions over a 12-month period in this patient

Associated biological markers

We evaluated biomarkers reflecting pioglitazone exposure.
STAT5 RNA expression levels were assessed in
CD34 1 cells from bone marrow at inclusion in 18 evaluable patients and during follow-up in 20 patients, including 15 patients with paired analysis at inclusion and at 6
months. STAT5 RNA levels were expressed relative to
GAPDH, and median values were 0.129 (range, 0.0980.266) before and 0.066 (range, 0.016-0.129) 6 months after pioglitazone initiation, showing a reduction in STAT5
RNA levels after pioglitazone treatment (P < .0001 [paired

CD34 1 cells were performed at inclusion, at 6 months after pioglitazone initiation, and at 12 months after pioglitazone initiation in 20, 19, and 5 patients, respectively. The
median numbers of colonies were 429 (range, 269-619) at
inclusion, 279 (range, 120-566) at 6 months, and 279
(range, 187-300) at 12 months. Paired comparisons at inclusion and at 6 months showed a reduction in clonogenicity (P 5 .0003) (Fig. 3B). We observed a trend for

DISCUSSION
We report here the ACTIM phase 2 trial on the use of the
PPAR-c agonist pioglitazone in addition to imatinib in
CML patients not achieving MR4.5 with imatinib alone.
Pioglitazone was administered at 30 to 45 mg/d, a dose
commonly used in type 2 diabetes patients. Overall,
patients were exposed to a lower dosage intensity of
32 mg/d. Therapy with pioglitazone was not prolonged
over 12 months, as requested by the regulatory agency of
France, and some patients interrupted the treatment prematurely. Despite this limitation, progression from
MMR to MR4.5 was observed in 13 patients (54%),
resulting in a cumulative incidence of molecular response
of 56% by 12 months. During follow-up after pioglitaCancer

zone priming, 88% of 17 evaluable imatinib patients
reached MR4.5 by 48 months, suggesting that the effects
of pioglitazone may be delayed.
Because pioglitazone and other PPAR-c agonists are
already approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, we
anticipate that the biological results we reported recently
may influence the management of CML patients by clinicians outside the setting of a clinical trial.15 This is why
we launched the ACTIM phase 2 trial as a proof-ofprinciple study, although in the absence of a control group
of patients, the benefit of pioglitazone in combination
with imatinib observed here needs to be confirmed by
subsequent randomized studies. However, 2 lines of evidence tend to support the overall conclusion, pending
randomized trials. First, patients on ACTIM had a median duration of imatinib therapy of 73 months without
having reached MR4.5 despite a median daily dose of
500 mg/d; second, our own estimate of the spontaneous
rate of MMR to MR4.5 progressions in a parallel cohort of
CML patients with characteristics closely similar to those
of ACTIM was 23%. In agreement with the expected biological effects of pioglitazone,15 a significant decline in
STAT5 transcription and CFC numbers was evidenced in
normal bone marrow from CML patients of the ACTIM
trial. Interestingly, decreasing CFC levels were positively
correlated with favorable kinetics of MR4.5 conversions.
Because pioglitazone is well tolerated in most diabetic patients and is not hypoglycemogenic in normal
individuals, the only substantial safety concern regarding
the use of pioglitazone was the slight increased risk of
bladder cancer reported in type 2 diabetes patients with
long-term exposure to the drug. However, the increased
risk was deemed sufficiently small by the US Food and
Drug Administration and other foreign bodies to not suspend the drug’s market authorization in light of its
expected benefit for the treatment of diabetes.16,17 Even
in France, where the drug has been withdrawn by the regulatory authority, a special authorization was granted to
pursue the first step of the ACTIM trial to completion.
Importantly, 2 recent epidemiologic studies are now
questioning this previous alert by concluding that pioglitazone exposure was not associated with an increased risk
of bladder cancer.20,21 No bladder tumor was detected
during follow-up in the ACTIM study.
Other approaches are currently tested in an effort to
eliminate CML stem cells. The Hedgehog pathway was
targeted by means of smoothened (SMO) inhibitors. Two
inhibitors were tested in the clinic, LDE225 and BMS833923. Their safety profile was not favorable, and no evidence of efficacy was reported.22,23 Preclinical data on
1797

animal models suggest that inhibiting the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway may also be of interest.24 Ongoing studies
have highlighted targets that are “drugable” with repositioned commercially available compounds such as interferon, arsenic trioxide, or JAK2 inhibitors. The
combination of pegylated interferon 2a or 2b to imatinib
in patients with newly diagnosed chronic phase CML
resulted in higher rates and deeper molecular responses in
2 prospective randomized trial.25,26 Combined interferon
and arsenic treatment was shown to prolong the survival
of primary CML mice and to impair severely CML engraftment into untreated secondary recipients, thereby
showing a major decrease in CML leukemia initiating cell
activity.27,28 Another approach that targets JAK2 with
ruxolitinib together with nilotinib has been reported to
enhance the elimination of primary human CML stem
cells in vitro, and ongoing clinical investigations are
attempting to achieve disease eradication.29
In conclusion, the results of the ACTIM study
reported here suggest that pioglitazone together with imatinib increases the proportion of CML patients who
achieve MR4.5, further suggesting that the ability of
PPAR-c agonists to erode the CML stem cell pool may be
of clinical benefit for CML patients.15 The combination
was well tolerated and may be continued as long as the
BCR-ABL1 signal remains detectable. The corroborating
ACTIW randomized trial is currently recruiting to address the questions that remain, such as the optimal duration of the combination and the ideal PPAR-c agonist to
be used. Discontinuation of both PPAR-c agonist and
TKI while obtaining a high rate of sustained treatmentfree remission is currently being tested and would be the
ultimate proof of the possibility of CML eradication and
cure using this approach.
