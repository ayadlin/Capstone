ABSTRACT
Inhibitors of JAK2 kinase are emerging as an important treatment modality for
myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). However, similar to other kinase inhibitors,
resistance to JAK2 inhibitors may eventually emerge through a variety of mechanisms.
Effective drug combination is one way to enhance therapeutic efficacy and combat
resistance against JAK2 inhibitors. To identify potential combination partners for JAK2
compounds in MPN cell lines, we performed pooled shRNA screen targeting 5,000
genes in the presence or absence of JAK2 blockade. One of the top hits identified
was MYC, an oncogenic transcription factor that is difficult to inhibit directly, but
could be targeted by modulation of upstream regulatory elements such as kinases.
We demonstrate herein that PIM kinase inhibitors efficiently suppress MYC protein
levels in MPN cell lines. Overexpression of MYC restores the viability of PIM inhibitortreated cells, revealing causal relationship between MYC down-regulation and cell
growth inhibition by PIM compounds. Combination of various PIM inhibitors with a
JAK2 inhibitor results in significant synergistic growth inhibition of multiple MPN
cancer cell lines and induction of apoptosis. Mechanistic studies revealed strong
downregulation of phosphorylated forms of S6 and 4EBP1 by JAK2/PIM inhibitor
combination treatment. Finally, such combination was effective in eradicating in vitro
JAK2 inhibitor-resistant MPN clones, where MYC is consistently up-regulated. These
findings demonstrate that simultaneous suppression of JAK2 and PIM kinase activity
by small molecule inhibitors is more effective than either agent alone in suppressing
MPN cell growth. Our data suggest that JAK2 and PIM combination might warrant
further investigation for the treatment of JAK2-driven hematologic malignancies.

INTRODUCTION

[11, 27], and clinical trials have been initiated based on
such findings. Similarly, an HSP90 inhibitor enhances
the anti-proliferative effects of JAK2 inhibitors by
destabilizing JAK2 proteins [28, 29]. Importantly, the
latter combination was able to overcome resistance to
JAK2 inhibitors in vitro [28, 29]. However, since both
HDAC and HSP90 inhibitors have pleiotropic effects,
their toxicity in combination with JAK2 suppression might
neither be easily predictable nor manageable.
To identify potent combination partners for JAK2
inhibitors, we utilized loss-of-function genomics approach
to search for targets that, when knocked down, could
synergize with JAK2 inhibition. This was achieved
through a pooled shRNA screen in the presence of various
concentrations of JAK2 inhibitor SAR302503 (also known
as TG101348 [12-14]) or DMSO control. We report
here that shRNA-mediated depletion of MYC strongly
synergizes with SAR302303 in suppressing viability of
MPN cell lines. Since direct pharmacological targeting
of MYC remains challenging, we pursued an orthogonal
approach to reduce MYC protein levels using pan-PIM
kinase inhibitors. As demonstrated herein, JAK2 and
PIM inhibitors strongly synergize to inhibit the growth
and induce apoptosis in MPN cell lines SET2 and UKE1,
as well as in JAK2 inhibitor-resistant clones. Our data
suggest that a combination of JAK2 and PIM inhibitors
might warrant further investigation for the treatment of
JAK2-driven hematologic malignancies.

JAK2 is one of important members of Janus kinase
family, which mediates cytokine signal transduction to
regulate cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation [1].
JAK2 is known to play a significant role in hematopoiesis
and immune responses, and is often involved in cytokine
dependent cancers. JAK2 fusions have been identified in
a variety of blood cancers in which JAK/STAT signaling
cascade is constitutively activated [2-5]. In 2005, V617F
point mutations in JAK2 were identified in a subset of
myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patients. This mutant
was later shown to induce MPN like phenotypes in mouse
models [6-11]. It is believed that V617F mutation enables
JAK2 to be constitutively active by reliving the negative
regulatory interaction between its kinase and pseudokinase domains.
It has been further demonstrated that JAK2 blockade
results in the inhibition of growth of MPN cells harboring
JAK2(V617F) mutant [12-14]. As a result, several JAK2
inhibitors have entered clinical trials for hematologic
malignancies. Ruxolitinib® (Jakafi) was the first JAK2
inhibitor to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of
intermediate and high risk myelofibrosis. While many
JAK2 inhibitors are able to achieve normalization of
leukocytosis and thrombocytosis, as well as improve
symptoms in cancer patients [15, 16], they are less
effective in achieving consistent hematologic remissions
and reducing JAK2(V617F) allelic burden [15, 17-20].
It is known that JAK-STAT pathway activation
in MPN may be caused by mechanisms other than
JAK2(V617F) mutation [21]. For example, genetic
alterations in the transmembrane domain of MPL can
also contribute to JAK-STAT activation and cytokine
independent growth [21]. Thus, it is doubtful that
JAK2 inhibitors alone would be able to achieve durable
responses in all MPN patients. This has prompted further
research into more effective therapeutic strategies to
combat MPN, specifically combination therapies. Potent
combination therapies might not only enhance the efficacy
of JAK2 inhibitors, but also limit the unwanted side
effects by lowering the dose of JAK2 inhibitors required
to achieve the overall therapeutic effect. Importantly,
combination therapies have greater chance of preventing
early resistance to targeted JAK2 therapy. Although no
additional JAK2 mutations have been detected thus far
in MPN patients undergoing JAK2 inhibitor treatment,
results of several in vitro studies suggest that JAK2
inhibitors may in fact be prone to resistance mediated by
novel point mutations in JAK2 itself as well as through
activation of other pathways [22-26].
Several combinations with JAK2 inhibitors have
been reported recently with beneficial effects on growth
inhibition of cells with JAK2 mutations. For example,
JAK2 inhibitors work synergistically with HDAC
inhibitor panobinostat in inhibiting JAK2 mutant cells

RESULTS
MYC is the top hit in a pooled shRNA library
screen to identify combination partners for JAK2
inhibitor
We undertook a systematic shRNA screening
approach to identify combination partners for JAK2
inhibitor SAR302503 using SET2 cells, an MPN cancer
cell line harboring JAK2 V617F mutation. SET2 cells
were infected with a pooled lentviral shRNA library
targeting 5,000 disease related genes (Fig. 1A, also
see Materials and Methods). Infection was kept at a
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 in order to deliver
approximately one shRNA per cell. In our experience,
such low MOI can greatly enhance the quality of the
screening results. Following infection, SET2 cells were
selected with puromycin for three days and re-plated at
low density before initiating treatment with DMSO or
JAK2 inhibitor at 0.2 and 0.35 µM, which are the IC25
and IC50 of SAR302503, respectively (Supplementary
Fig.1). Cells were harvested at 0, 7 and 14 days post drug
treatment and cellular genomic DNA was subjected to
amplification and deep sequencing to determine shRNA
copy number. Lethal shRNAs, which showed greater than

10 fold decrease in abundance in DMSO treated samples
on day 7 or day 14 versus day 0, were excluded from
further analysis. The combinational effects were revealed
by comparing the quantity of each shRNA in the sample
treated with JAK2 inhibitor versus the sample treated
with DMSO. To be statistically significant “sensitizer” in
this particular screen, each shRNA had to show at least
1.5-fold difference between the treatments, meaning that
it sensitized the cells to JAK2 inhibition by at least 1.5fold. After the shRNAs passing the above criteria were
identified, they were further ranked by the number of
shRNAs present per gene. MYC was ranked as a top hit

with four out of five shRNAs scoring as sensitizers to
JAK2 inhibitions at three different concentrations at day
14 (Fig. 1B, supplementary Fig.2). Additional hits with
2-3 shRNAs per gene were shown in Supplementary
Fig. 3. To validate MYC as a hit, SET2 cells were stably
infected with inducible MYC shRNA. Doxycycline
inductions depleted MYC shRNA efficiently, and led to
about 2-fold sensitization of SET2 cells to JAK2 inhibitor
SAR302503, as measured by cell viability (Supplementary
Fig.4). Taken together, our results identify MYC oncogene
as potential combination partner for JAK2 inhibitors.

SAR302503 at 0.2 and 0.35 μM. Cells were harvested at 0, 7 and 14 days post drug treatment and cellular genomic DNA was subjected to
amplification followed by deep sequencing to determine shRNA copy number. (B) The phenotype of combinational effects was revealed

levels at relatively low compound concentration (Fig 2A,
B). In addition, PIM1/2/3 proteins were stabilized in the
presence of PIM kinase inhibitors, consistent with the
inhibition of PIM autophosphorylation and suppression of
negative feedback loop of PIM itself.
MYC is one of several substrates of PIM kinases.
We therefore sought to establish that suppression of MYC
protein levels by PIM inhibitors is a key determinant of
their anti-proliferative activity in MPN cells. To this end,
MYC was cloned into a doxycycline-inducible vector
and stably transfected into UKE1 cells. UKE1 stable cell
line was then treated with increasing concentrations of
PIM inhibitor compound C, in the presence or absence
of doxycycline. Expression of MYC was confirmed by
immunoblot 24 hours and 72 hours after doxycycline
induction (Fig. 2C). When MYC was expressed,
we observed significant rescue of anti-proliferative
phenotype of PIM inhibitors (Fig. 2D). The effect was

Since MYC druggability remains a significant
challenge, we decided to focus on potential upstream
modulators that control MYC protein abundance. One
group of such regulators is the PIM family kinases which
directly phosphorylate MYC on Ser329 resulting in MYC
stabilization [30]. Knock-down of PIM isoforms has been
shown to dramatically reduce MYC protein levels [30]. To
test our hypothesis that PIM kinase inhibition might destabilize MYC protein and thus recapitulate the effect of
MYC shRNA, we treated two MPN cell lines, SET2 and
UKE1, with three pan-PIM inhibitors representing distinct
chemical classes (Supplementary Fig. 5). Strikingly, all
three PIM inhibitors significantly reduced MYC protein

PIM compound. These results highlight the critical role
of MYC downregulation in the overall anti-proliferative
effect of PIM inhibitors.

formally assess synergy between the two compounds
tested, isobologram analysis was performed and a
combination index (CI) was computed for each drug
combination according to Chou-Talalay’s method [31].
Combination index values below 1.0 usually signals
synergy, values around 1.0 represent additivity and those
above 1.0 represent antagonism between the two drugs
tested. All three PIM inhibitors tested herein demonstrated
strong synergistic effects with SAR302503, with CI values
around 0.2 in both SET2 and UKE1 cells (Fig. 3). Similar,
although weaker, synergistic effects were also observed
when Ruxolitinib® (JAKafi) was combined with the same
PIM inhibitors (data not shown), indicating that PIM and
JAK2 inhibitors form a synergistic combination to inhibit
the growth of MPN cell lines.
To confirm and extend these observations, we

We next asked if, similar to MYC shRNA, PIM
inhibitor could indeed be a good combination partner
for JAK2 inhibitor. To test this, SET2 and UKE1 cells
were treated with a combination of the JAK2 inhibitor
SAR302503 and three distinct PIM1/2/3 inhibitors,
utilizing nine concentrations for each compound. To

repeated drug combination experiments, now holding the
concentration of JAK2 compound constant and below
the IC50 value, while titrating in PIM inhibitors at five
different concentrations. As can be seen in figure 4,
JAK2 inhibitor alone inhibited proliferation of SET2 and
UKE1 cells by approximately 25% at the concentration
tested. PIM inhibitors caused dose-dependent reduction

in cell viability, which was significantly potentiated by
the addition of the JAK2 inhibitor. Most importantly,
JAK2/PIM combination appeared to have reduced the cell
number below initial plating density implying that active
cell death, rather than inhibition of cell proliferation, was
taking place. This phenotype was more pronounced in
UKE1 cells (Fig. 4B).

(CTGbefore) and after 3 days of drug treatment (CTGafter). Effects of drug treatments were calculated as a ratio of (CTGafter-CTGbefore)/ CTGbefore.

To further investigate the impact of combined
JAK2/PIM blockade on the induction of apoptosis in MPN
cell lines, SET2 and UKE1 cells were treated with a fixed
concentration of JAK2 inhibitor and an increasing amount
of each of the three PIM inhibitors. Caspase activity was
used as a read-out for apoptosis induction. As shown in
figure 5, neither JAK2 nor PIM inhibitor alone induced
apoptosis at the doses tested. However, apoptosis was
greatly increased in both cell lines and in a dose dependent
manner when JAK2 compound was combined with either

PIM inhibitor (Fig. 5). Taken together with cell viability
data, these results strongly suggest that JAK2 and panPIM inhibitors act synergistically to induce caspase
activation and cell death in MPN cell lines.

types [32]. In turn, PIM controls cellular survival and
proliferation through a plethora of downstream targets,
including transcription factors (MYC), components of
protein translation machinery (4EBP1), regulators of
apoptosis (BAD) and cell cycle (CDC25A/C) and many
others [33-35]. Therefore, in order to obtain additional
mechanistic insights into synergistic activity of JAK2 and
PIM inhibitors, we examined key biochemical readouts
that are known to be regulated by JAK/STAT/PIM
signaling. Phosphorylation of pro-survival P70 S6 kinase
(pP70S6K), ribosomal protein S6 (pS6) and a key mediator
of protein translation 4-EBP1 (p4EBP1) were significantly
reduced by the combination of JAK2 and PIM inhibitors
in both SET2 and UKE1 cells, while each agent alone
exerted only modest effects (Fig. 6). Importantly, all three
PIM inhibitors displayed similar synergistic activity with
the JAK2 inhibitor on downstream signaling, suggesting
that the observed effects are not compound-specific. These
results solidify our earlier phenotypic observations and
offer mechanistic basis for strong combinatorial effects of
JAK2 and PIM inhibitors in suppressing MPN cell growth.

undermine clinical utility of these agents in the treatment
of cancer patients. Therefore, effective drug combinations
are urgently needed to combat such resistance. We set
out to generate JAK2 inhibitor-resistant clones and test
JAK2/PIM drug combination in this setting. To induce
resistance, SET2 cells were continuously cultured in the
presence of IC90 of JAK2 inhibitor (2 µM) for 8 weeks.
Four individual clones were isolated and characterized for
sensitivity to JAK2 compound. As demonstrated in figure
7A, resistant clones were significantly less sensitive to
JAK2 inhibitor than parental SET2 cells. All resistant
clones consistently exhibited upregulation of MYC, PIM1
and PIM2, while maintaining similar protein levels of
PIM3. In addition, phospho-STAT3/5 and phospho-JAK2
were significantly increased in JAK2 inhibitor resistant
cells (Fig. 7B). Survival of all four resistant clones
was substantially reduced by the combination of JAK2
and PIM inhibitors. Furthermore, we again detected a
reduction in relative cell number below the initial plating
density, suggestive of cell killing rather than suppression
of cell proliferation (Fig. 7C). Our data imply that JAK2/
PIM inhibitor combination could be beneficial in the
context of resistance to JAK2 monotherapy.

combination partners for JAK2 inhibitors in MPN
cell lines. Utilizing unbiased screening approach, we
discovered that MYC knock-down enhances antiproliferative effects of JAK2 compound, with four out
of five MYC shRNAs meeting the “sensitizer” criteria. It
is worthy to note that multiple other hits are known to
be involved in MYC network, such as Notch1, Arrb2,
Mlh1, Mvd, Nfyc, Tgif2 and others [36]. To circumvent
significant druggability challenges associated with direct
targeting of MYC, we turned to PIM kinase inhibitors
to downregulate MYC protein levels in MPN cells.

Incidentally, deep biological connections between MYC
and PIM have already been well established. For example,
tumorigenesis in transgenic mice co-expressing both Eμ–
Pim1 and Eμ–Myc is vastly accelerated, thus highlighting
strong synergism between these two oncogenes [37].
In addition, PIM1/2 is able to phosphorylate MYC and
dramatically increases MYC protein stability, thereby
promoting oncogenic transcriptional activity of MYC [38].
On the other hand, MYC has been shown to upregulate
PIM1 in certain tumors [39], further reinforcing the
intricate interplay between these two proteins. It should

be noted however, other pharmacological agents are
capable of downregulating MYC. For example, CDK/
CK1 inhibitors have been shown to suppress MYC levels
in human neuroblastoma cell lines [40]. It remains to be
determined if these inhibitors would behave similarly in
MPN cells.
JAK2/PIM inhibitor combination described herein is
likely to be one of several strategies to enhance therapeutic
efficacy of JAK2 compounds. For instance, combination
of JAK1/2 and pan-histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors
has already been shown to be well-tolerated in mouse
models of JAK2V617F-driven disease and resulted in
improved efficacy compared with single agents [27].
Signaling nodes along the JAK2 signaling pathway have
also been interrogated for potential combination partners
[1, 41]. Co-treatment with mTOR and JAK2 inhibitors
had synergistic activity against the proliferation of
JAK2V617F mutated cell lines [42]. In another study, a
series of serine/threonine kinase inhibitors were tested in
combination with JAK2 compounds in BaF3 TpoR JAK2
V617F cells. The strongest synergy was observed with
the pan PI3K inhibitors GDC0940 and dual PI3K/mTOR
inhibitor BEZ235 [43]. Thus both HDAC and PI3K/
mTOR inhibitors may represent examples of additional
combination partners for JAK2 compounds. However,
our data convincingly show that JAK/PIM combination
not only enhances the efficacy of JAK2 inhibitors in
“naïve” MPN cells, but can also eradicates MPN cells
that have become resistant to JAK2 monotherapy The
increased MYC protein levels observed in the resistant
cells described in this work might be the underlying
or a contributing resistance mechanism, and MYC
destabilization via PIM inhibition a means to resensitize
these cells to JAK2 inhibition. In addition, the safety
profile of pan-PIM inhibitors is likely to be more favorable
than other combination partners since PIM1/2/3 knock-out
mice are viable and fertile [44].
Our data suggest that JAK2/PIM, as well as other
JAK2 combinations, might be converging on essential
signaling nodes in MPN cells, including pP70S6K and
p4EBP1, both of which are mTORC1 substrates [45].
4EBP1 is essential for cap-dependent mRNA translation
[46], and was recently identified as a druggable target in
tumors with MYC activation [47]. Downregulation of
p4EBP1 was observed when JAK2(V617F)-expressing
cells were treated with the combination of JAK2 inhibitor
and pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 [28]. Thus,
downregulation of 4EBP1 function might represent
an important determinant of efficacy of JAK2/PIM
combination therapy.
In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that
simultaneous suppression of JAK2 and PIM kinase
activity by small molecule inhibitors is more effective than
either agent alone in inhibiting the growth of MPN cells.
This combination is also effective in eradicating JAK2
inhibitor-resistant MPN clones in vitro. If translated into

clinical practice, combined JAK2/PIM blockade may be
able to enhance the efficacy of current JAK2 inhibitors and
combat the threat of emerging resistance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and culture conditions
SET2 cell line was purchased from DSMZ
(Braunschweig, GERMANY). UKE1 cell line was a kind
gift from Dr. Ross Levine at MSKCC (New York, USA).
SET2 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium (Gibco,
Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 20% fetal
bovine serum (FBS, Gibco). UKE1 cells were cultured
in IMEM (Gibco) medium supplemented with 10% FBS.
Both cell lines were kept in a 37˚C humidified incubator
containing 5% CO2.

Compounds
Structures of the compounds used in this study are
shown in Supplementary Figure 5. Compound A-2 and
Compound B-2 are PIM inhibitors identified from Sanofi
internal drug discovery efforts. These compounds inhibit
all three PIM isoforms, PIM1, PIM2 and PIM3 with
biochemical IC50 ranging from 0.1-30nM. Compound
C is a comparably potent PIM inhibitor developed by
Novartis [48]. JAK2 inhibitor SAR302503 is also known
as TG101348 that inhibits JAK2 with an IC50 of 6nM.
All compounds were internally synthesized and stock
solutions were diluted in dimethylsulfoxide. (DMSO,
Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis, MO, USA)

Immunoblot
SET2 or UKE1 cells were treated with either
single inhibitor or a combination of PIM inhibitor and
JAK2 inhibitor respectively for 4 hours at indicated
concentrations. The compounds were then washed off
by PBS. The cell pellets were collected and lysed with
RIPA buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, Texas
USA) supplemented with HaltTM phosphatase, protease
inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL USA,)
and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride solution (PMSF,
Sigma-Aldrich). Lysates were resolved on a 4-12% BisTris gel (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes
were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature with 5%
milk, then incubated with the indicated primary antibodies
at 1:1000 dilution at 4°C overnight. All primary antibodies
were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA):

packaging plasmids and MYC expression plasmid or
an empty vector were transiently co-tranfected into
HEK293T cells and lentiviral supernatants were collected
and concentrated using Lenti-X concentrator (Clontech,
Mountain View, CA USA). UKE1 cells were infected with
lentivirus in the presence of 8μg/ml polybrene (Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA) with the concentrated lentiviruses
at different MOI. The transduced cells were cultured in
selection medium including 1μg/ml puromycin.

Cell viability/proliferation assay and synergism
assessment
Log growth phase cells were suspended in growth
medium and seeded into 96-well plates at density of
1.6x104 per well and treated with either single inhibitor
or combinations of PIM inhibitor and JAK2 inhibitor
respectively for 72 hours at 37°C. Serially diluted
compounds (up to 10μM) were used in all studies. Cell
viability/proliferative expansion was assessed by addition
CellTiter-Glo® reagent (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin,
USA, G7573) for 10 minutes, and endpoint readings
were collected using a SpectraMax Pro V5 plate reader
(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).  The intensity
of the luminescence signal was directly proportional to
the number of live cells. The IC50 of single compound
was determined with XLfit and Biost@t-SPEED.
The combination index (CI) was used to evaluate the
interaction between PIM inhibitor and JAK2 inhibitor.
Synergy was described using an isobologram, which
compared the doses needed to reach 50% inhibition (IC50,
calculated with Xfit) along an equal-effect contour to
those along a predicted straight line based on a model of
dose additivity effect. Combination index was calculated
using the formula CI = CX/IC50X + CY/IC50Y, where
CX or CY is the concentration of compound X or Y in
a 50% effective mixture of the most potent combination,
and IC50X or IC50Y is the IC50 of either compound
when applied as single agent. CI values of <1 indicate
synergism, CI =1 indicate additivity and CI>1 indicate
antagonism.

JAK2 inhibitor-resistant SET2 cell lines
SET2 cells were continuously cultured in the growth
medium containing 2 µM of SAR302503 for 8 weeks to
generate resistant clones. Four individual clones (B9, C10,
D7, E11) were chosen for further analysis and routinely
maintained in the culture medium containing 2 µM of
SAR302503.
