Abstract
While patients with advanced prostate cancer initially respond favorably to androgen ablation therapy, most
experience a relapse of the disease within 1–2 years. Although hormone-refractory disease is unresponsive to
androgen-deprivation, androgen receptor (AR)-regulated signaling pathways remain active and are necessary for
cancer progression. Thus, both AR itself and the processes downstream of the receptor remain viable targets for
therapeutic intervention. Microarray analysis of multiple clinical cohorts showed that the serine/threonine
kinase Ca2þ/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase b (CaMKKb) is both highly expressed in the prostate
and further elevated in prostate cancers. Using cellular models of prostate cancer, we have determined that
androgens (a) directly increase the expression of a CaMKKb splice variant and (b) increase functional CaMKKb
protein levels as determined by the phosphorylation of both CaMKI and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK),
two of CaMKKb's primary substrates. Importantly, inhibition of the CaMKKb-AMPK, but not CaMKI, signaling
axis in prostate cancer cells by pharmacological inhibitors or siRNA-mediated knockdown blocks androgenmediated migration and invasion. Conversely, overexpression of CaMKKb alone leads to both increased AMPK
phosphorylation and cell migration. Given the key roles of CaMKKb and AMPK in the biology of prostate cancer
cells, we propose that these enzymes are potential therapeutic targets in prostate cancer. Cancer Res; 71(2); 528–37.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men
and is second only to lung cancer in terms of cancer mortalities (1). If diagnosed early, most localized prostate tumors
are successfully treated by surgery alone. However, as with
many cancers, the treatment of the advanced disease state
requires a systemic approach to inhibit the growth and spread
of secondary metastases. Prostate cancers express the androgen receptor (AR) and rely on androgens for growth and

survival (2). Subsequently, androgen ablation therapies are
the standard of care for late-stage disease. Although 80% of
patients with prostate cancer respond favorably to initial
androgen ablation therapy, most patients experience a relapse
of the disease within 1–2 years (2). Despite the unresponsiveness of the hormone-refractory disease to androgen-deprivation therapy, AR-regulated signaling pathways remain active
and are necessary for cancer progression (3). Consequently,
AR and the processes downstream of the receptor remain
viable targets for therapeutic intervention.
Several approaches are currently used to target the AR
signaling axis in prostate cancer. Current therapies focus on
decreasing the levels of circulating androgens and/or competitively blocking the AR transcriptional complex. Specifically,
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are used to
suppress the testicular production of testosterone whereas
antiandrogens, such as bicalutamide, function by competitively inhibiting the interaction of androgens with AR. The
initial response to either form of androgen deprivation is very
high. However, the rapid onset of resistance to these interventions has highlighted the need for novel strategies to target
the hormone-independent activities of AR. In this regard, our
group and others have shown that the targeting of specific
signaling pathways downstream of AR represents a potential
new modality for the treatment of prostate cancer (4–7).
Most of the studies on the role of androgens in prostate
cancer have focused on defining the mechanisms underlying

the mitotic actions of this hormone (8). However, there is a
growing body of evidence that AR signaling also influences
tumor cell migration and invasion. Of note, different clinical
trials of goserelin (a GnRH analog) in prostate cancer patients
show reduced incidences of distant metastases (9, 10).
Furthermore, it has recently been reported that MDV3100,
a second-generation AR-antagonist, decreases the number of
circulating tumor cells in approximately half of the treated
castration-resistant patients (11). Cumulatively, these data
suggest that androgen ablation therapy not only inhibits
the growth of the primary tumor, but also reduces progression
to metastatic disease. The onus is now on researchers to
identify what specific cellular processes regulated by AR
contribute to the pathogenesis of prostate cancer and ultimately, whether they represent realistic therapeutic targets.
To identify potential new points of intervention in ARdriven prostate cancer, we focused on candidate target proteins that are a) expressed in the prostate, b) regulated by AR,
c) track with disease outcome, and d) likely to be druggable.
We also included in our criteria the requirement that the
target be expressed in various cellular models of prostate
cancer. Using these criteria, the Ca2þ/calmodulin-dependent
protein kinase kinase b (CaMKKb) was identified as a protein
of interest. Subsequently, we carried out a comprehensive
analysis of its role in prostate cancer and showed that
CaMKKb is likely to be a useful target for the treatment of
this disease.

Materials and Methods
A description of the chemicals, antibodies, plasmids, and
stable cell lines used in this study can be found in the
Supplementary Materials.
Cell culture and RNA
The LNCaP and VCaP human prostate carcinoma cell lines
were obtained from ATCC and maintained as recommended.
All experiments were carried out with cells of passage less
than 25. These cells were authenticated by morphological
inspection and mycoplasma testing by the ATCC. Furthermore, their response to androgens was authenticated using
growth and reporter gene assays. RNA from placenta, skeletal
muscle, cerebellum, whole brain, and normal prostate was
from Clontech. RNA from glioblastoma cell lines was a generous gift from Valerie Curtis.
RNA isolation, cDNA preparation, and quantitative and
standard reverse transcription (RT)-PCR
RNA isolation, cDNA preparation, and quantitative RT-PCR
(qPCR) were carried out as previously described using 36B4 as
a control (12). Standard RT-PCR was carried out using the
Advantage GC 2 Polymerase Mix and PCR Kit (Clontech). All
qPCR and RT-PCR primers used in this study are listed in
Supplementary Table 1.
Western blot analysis
Western blots were conducted as previously described (12)
with the exception that a modified radioimmunoprecipitation

NaCl, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/L EGTA,
10% glycerol, 50 mmol/L NaF, 2 mmol/L Na3VO4 and protease
inhibitors] was used. Results shown are representative blots.
For each sample, protein levels were determined by densitometry using the ImageJ software (NIH) and normalizing to the
indicated controls.
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection of human
prostate cells
Stealth siRNA (Invitrogen) transfections were carried out as
previously described (5). The sequences of all siRNAs used in
this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was conducted as
previously described (4). All primers used for ChIP qPCR
analysis are listed in Supplementary Table 1.
Transient transfections and reporter gene assays
Transient transfections and reporter gene assays were
carried out as previously described (4).
Cell proliferation assay
Proliferation assays were carried out as previously
described (12) by measuring the cellular DNA content using
the FluoReporter Blue Fluorometric double-stranded DNA
Quantitation Kit (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's protocol.
Migration and invasion assays
Boyden dual-chamber migration assays were carried out as
previously described (4). Invasion assays were carried out the
same as migration assays except that inserts were layered with
100 mL of Matrigel extracellular matrix (BD Biosciences) prior
to reseeding of cells.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using 1-way ANOVA and post hoc
Dunnett's test with GraphPad Prism, Version 4 (GraphPad
Software, Inc.). Unless otherwise noted, significance was
determined at the P < 0.05 level.

Results
Androgens increase CaMKKb mRNA and protein levels
in an AR-dependent manner
In an effort to identify novel prostate cancer therapeutics,
we have focused on defining key regulators downstream of AR
action that contribute to prostate pathobiology and that may
be amenable to pharmacological exploitation. As a first step in
this process, we analyzed the expression level of mRNAs
encoding targetable signaling molecules using microarray
data derived from androgen-treated LNCaP prostate cancer
cells (13). These studies suggested that one such candidate,
CaMKKb, was upregulated by androgens. To confirm the
significance of this observation, CaMKKb mRNA levels were
analyzed by qPCR following treatment with the synthetic

lines, CaMKKb mRNA levels increased in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, western immunoblot analysis
revealed a corresponding dose-dependent increase in
CaMKKb protein levels in both cell lines (Fig. 1B). The
specificity of the antibodies used in this study was verified
using 3 different siRNAs targeting CaMKKb mRNA (Fig. 1C). In
addition, analogous immunoblot results were obtained using a
second antibody (clone 1A11) directed against CaMKKb
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Finally, androgen-mediated induction, but not the basal expression, of CaMKKb mRNA was
abrogated in cells in which AR expression was inhibited using
a validated siRNA (4) directed against the AR mRNA (Fig. 1D).
Taken together, these data show that androgens, acting
through AR, increase both CaMKKb mRNA and protein levels
in multiple cellular models of prostate cancer.

human samples. Analysis of the clinically annotated prostate
cancer data sets accessible through Oncomine revealed that
CaMKKb expression increases with grade (14–17) (Supplementary Figs. S2A and B). Interestingly, this analysis also
revealed that CaMKKb was consistently overexpressed in
prostate tumors, but not other malignancies (Supplementary
Fig. S2C) (18). Importantly, approximately 80% of metastatic
prostate cancers from noncastrated patients overexpress
CaMKKb, whereas fewer than 15% of castrated patients show
elevated levels of CaMKKb, indicating AR regulation of
CaMKKb in an in vivo clinical setting (19).
The full-length CaMKKb protein is encoded by an mRNA
composed of 18 exons. Interestingly, the majority of commercially available CaMKKb antibodies target the C-terminus of the
protein that is absent in some functionally active splice variants
(20). Thus, given that the expression of CaMKKb in the prostate
has not been reported previously, we hypothesized that the
prostate, and prostate cancers, may express a functionally
important splice variant(s) of CaMKKb that was not recognized
by the most commonly used antibodies. To test this hypothesis,
we carried out RT-PCR analysis using primers spanning various
exon boundaries to examine the splice variant repertoire in the

CaMKKb is necessary and sufficient for AR-mediated
prostate cancer cell migration and invasion
Given that the expression of CaMKKb is upregulated by
androgens and is elevated in prostate cancer, we next wanted
to assess its potential role(s) in processes of pathological
importance in this disease. As a first step, we evaluated the
ability of the CaMKK antagonist STO-609 to inhibit the
androgen-mediated cellular growth of prostate cancer cells.
However, at a concentration that suppressed CaMKKb activity
(Supplementary Fig. S4A), this drug had no significant effect
on LNCaP and VCaP cell number over the 7-day period of this
assay (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S4B).
In addition to proliferation, androgens increase the migration of prostate cancer cells (4, 21). Since CaMKKb has
recently been implicated in cell migration during neuronal

normal prostate and in prostate cancer cells. In this manner, it
was shown that unlike in brain, which expresses a longer variant,
both normal prostate and prostate cancer cells predominantly
express shorter variants of CaMKKb (Figs. 2A and B and
Supplementary Fig. S3). The variants found are equivalent to
the previously described CaMKKb splice variants 2 and 7 that
lack exon 16 (of note, splice variants 2 and 7 make identical
protein products) (20). Interestingly, these shorter variants were
also found in brain tumors (Fig. 2B). A complete analysis of the
additional variants expressed in the prostate/prostate cancer is
described in Supplementary Figure S3. Importantly, phosphorylation of the classical CaMKKb target CaMKI was observed in
both androgen-treated LNCaP and VCaP cells (Fig. 2C), indicating that the CaMKKb variant expressed in prostate cancer cells
is functionally active.

development (22, 23), we next asked whether CaMKKb is
important for AR-meditated prostate cancer cell migration
and/or invasion. Using Boyden dual-chamber migration
assays, treatment with the CaMKK antagonist STO-609
blocked the androgen-mediated migration of both LNCaP
(Fig. 3B, top) and VCaP prostate cancer cells (Supplementary
Fig. S4C). Importantly, STO-609 also inhibited androgenmediated invasion of LNCaP cells through a Matrigel extracellular matrix (Fig. 3B, bottom). Furthermore, knockdown of
CaMKKb suppressed, whereas its overexpression increased,
both basal and androgen-stimulated cell migration (Figs. 3C,
3D and Supplementary Figs. S4D, S4E). These findings highlight a heretofore unrecognized role for CaMKKb in prostate
cancer cell migration and invasion.
Definition of the molecular mechanism for ARmediated CaMKKb mRNA expression
Using a knockdown/replacement strategy, it was shown
that expression of wild-type AR, but not a transcriptionally
inactive DNA binding mutant (C562S), was able to complement the knockdown of endogenously expressed AR in an
LNCaP cell migration assay (Supplementary Fig. S5). Furthermore, at a concentration that inhibits the expression of
secondary androgen target genes (ex. CXCR4 (4)), cycloheximide treatment did not block the R1881-mediated increase in
CaMKKb mRNA levels (Fig. 4A). Together, these data indicate
that CaMKKb is a primary AR target gene.
By mining our previously published ChIP on Chip data
(24), we identified a putative AR binding region located
approximately 2.3 kb upstream of the CaMKKb transcriptional start site (Fig. 4B, top). No other AR binding was

CaMKIV is not expressed in the prostate (data not shown), we
tested whether AR-CaMKKb signaling led to increased CaMKI
and/or AMPK signaling. Western blot analysis revealed that
androgens increased the phosphorylation of both CaMKI and
AMPK at their CaMKKb activation loop target sites (T177 and
T172, respectively) in both LNCaP and VCaP cells, an effect
that was reversed by pretreatment with STO-609 (Fig. 5A and
Supplementary Fig. S7A). Interestingly, we found that overexpression of CaMKKb alone was sufficient to increase the
phosphorylation/activity of AMPK, but not CaMKI (Fig. 5B).
These findings indicated that AMPK, rather than CaMKI,
could be regulating cell migration because CaMKKb overexpression alone was also sufficient to increase migration
(Fig. 3D). To verify this, we used our most efficacious siRNAs
(Supplementary Fig. S7B) to knockdown both isoforms of the
catalytic subunit of AMPK (Fig. 5C, bottom and Supplementary Fig. S7C) or CaMKI (Fig. 5D, bottom and Supplementary
Fig. S7D). In this manner, it was shown that loss of AMPK, but
not CaMKI, resulted in decreased prostate cancer cell migra-

tion (Figs. 5C and D). Similarly, siRNA-mediated knockdown of
AMPK decreased both basal and CaMKKb-driven migration,
indicating that either the residual AMPK activity left after
siRNA transfection is sufficient to promote migration or an
additional downstream target, unknown at this time, exists for
CaMKKb (Supplementary Fig. S8). In support of the results
observed upon CaMKKb mRNA knockdown, cotreatment of
cells with the AMPK antagonist compound C, at a concentration that inhibited its kinase activity, completely abolished
androgen-mediated cell migration (Supplementary Figs. S9A
and B). However, in addition to inhibiting AMPK, we have
determined that compound C also exhibits indirect inhibitory
actions on AR-mediated transcription, a finding that makes it
difficult to use the drug alone to implicate AMPK as the sole
target of CaMKKb (Supplementary Fig. S9C). Nevertheless,
treatment of LNCaP cells with the AMP mimetic AICAR alone
was sufficient to increase cell migration (Supplementary
Figs. S9A and D). These data highlight a central role for AMPK
in prostate cancer cell migration. Definition of the mechanism

CaMKKb as a Therapeutic Target in Prostate Cancer

(s) by which AMPK interfaces with the cellular processes
responsible for migration and invasion is currently under
investigation.

Discussion
The androgen-signaling axis constitutes the primary and
most successful therapeutic target in prostate cancer (26).
Regardless, the mechanism(s) by which AR impacts processes
of pathological importance and the signaling pathways it
modulates to accomplish these activities remain largely
unknown. It is of significance, therefore, that we show that
the CaMKKb-AMPK signaling pathway is downstream of AR
and mediates the effects of androgens on prostate cancer cell
migration and invasion. Importantly, both CaMKKb and
AMPK are druggable targets that potentially can be exploited
to generate new prostate cancer therapeutics.
CaMKKb is highly expressed in the brain, where it functions
to regulate axonal outgrowth, dendritic maturation, and the
formation of dendritic spines and synapses (27). These processes are regulated by the CaMKKb-initiated phosphorylation and activation of CaMKI and CaMKIV, two of its known
primary substrates. Recently, AMPK has been identified as a
third substrate of CaMKKb (28–30). AMPK coordinates energy
balance, fatty acid oxidation, autophagy, and CO2 sensing in
both neuronal and nonneuronal tissues. It is composed of an a
catalytic subunit and b and g regulatory subunits. Our data
show that CaMKKb-induced prostate cancer cell migration
requires AMPK and, more specifically, the a1 catalytic kinase
subunit of AMPK (Fig. 5). These findings are not completely
surprising as 1) the a1 subunit, but not the a2 subunit, has a
predominately cytoplasmic cellular localization and thus,
would be the more likely target for the cytoplasmically localized CaMKKb protein (31) and perhaps more importantly 2)
the a2 subunit is not highly expressed in the prostate (32) or in
prostate cancer cells (data not shown). Regardless, our data
show an additional role for the CaMKKb-AMPK-signaling axis
in prostate cancer cell migration.
The role of AMPK in prostate cancer pathogenesis has
been controversial. Studies have shown that AMPK is frequently activated in human prostate cancers and inhibition
of its activity, using the antagonist compound C, has inhibitory effects on cell growth (33). Conversely, several laboratories, including our own (data not shown), have shown that
AICAR and the antidiabetic drugs metformin and rosiglitazone, activators of AMPK, also inhibit prostate cancer cell
growth (34–36). These discrepancies could be attributed to
the pleiotropic effects of the various small molecule modulators. For example, AMPK-activators, such as AICAR,
function by mimicking cellular stress and therefore, may
potentiate other stress responses and activate all cellular
AMPK. Hence, small molecule AMPK activators may block
cell growth through a variety of indirect mechanisms. Nonetheless, it is possible that the role of AMPK as a master
regulator of metabolism includes sensing cellular starvation,
halting cellular growth and the subsequent induction of cell
motility, thus allowing cells to migrate toward more nutrient-rich environments.

AMPK signaling has been implicated in angiogenesis and
specifically in endothelial cell migration (37). At this time,
however, it is unclear how AMPK controls prostate cancer cell
migration. In both neuronal and endothelial cells, CaMKKb
and/or AMPK have been shown to potentiate the activity of
Rac1 (23, 38, 39), a master regulator of cellular migration (40).
Thus, the CaMKKb-AMPK signaling pathway may augment
prostate cell migration and invasion through activation of
Rac1. Indeed, preliminary data in our laboratory suggests
androgens increase Rac1 activity (data not shown). Additionally, elevated Rac1 activity has been shown to increase the
aggressiveness of prostate cancer cells (41, 42). Thus, Rac1
may function as a conduit for cellular signaling pathways, such
as CaMKKb-AMPK to control aspects of prostate cancer
pathogenesis.
The enzymatic activity of CaMKKb is regulated by Ca2þ/
calmodulin. Recently, augmented calcium intake has been
correlated with increased prostate cancer incidence (43).
Furthermore, calcium influx promotes the migration and
metastasis of both prostate and breast cancers (44, 45). The
data presented here may provide a mechanistic link between
calcium uptake and cell migration. Our studies also show
that overexpression of CaMKKb alone was sufficient to
increase AMPK activity and cellular migration. This suggests
that the basal levels of calcium present in the prostate
cancer cells were sufficient to result in CaMKKb activation
(Figs. 3 and 5). Hence, the observation that the levels of
CaMKKb alone dictate cellular processes (Fig. 3) underscores the importance of AR's regulation of CaMKKb expression (Figs. 1 and 4).
Although various upstream signaling pathways have been
shown to regulate the activity of CaMKKb, to our knowledge,
this is the first exhibited regulation of CaMKKb expression by
any signaling pathway. This strongly implicates a role for
genomic androgen signaling in cellular migration. Other
laboratories have suggested that androgens, through rapid
nongenomic mechanisms, alter cytoskeletal reorganization
and, in this manner, may impact migration (46, 47). In our
hands, only prostate cancer cells expressing a wild-type AR,
but not an AR containing a DNA-binding domain mutation
that abrogated its transcriptional activity, could convey
androgen-mediated cell migration (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Additionally, androgens did not promote significant levels of
cell migration a) within 6 hours of hormone treatment or b) in
the presence of the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D
(data not shown), indicating that androgen-mediated migration is not rapid and likely requires the genomic actions of AR.
Thus, although androgens may increase cellular migration in
part through nongenomic signaling, this work underscores the
importance of the genomic actions of androgens in this
process.
This study advocates the inhibition of the AR-CaMKKbAMPK pathway as a novel therapeutic approach for the
treatment of prostate cancer. In particular, CaMKKb represents a practical target for future drug development because
of its restricted expression and the exhibited ability of
small molecules to block its activity (ex. STO-609). Additionally, CaMKKb-/- mice display no overt developmental

prostate abnormalities and do not exhibit fertility problems
(data not shown). In subsequent studies, it will be
interesting to cross these knockout animals with various
prostate cancer mouse models to determine if CaMKKb is
required for their pathogenesis. Given what is currently
known about CaMKKb biology and considering the results
of the studies reported here, we believe that in regards to
prostate cancer therapeutics, an ideal inhibitor of this
enzyme should exhibit selectivity for CaMKKb over the
related and more ubiquitous CaMKKa isoform and should
not be able to cross the blood-brain barrier. This would
isolate the actions of the drug and prevent it from interfering
with CaMKKb-regulated processes in the brain. Taken
together, the data presented here indicate that a next-generation CaMKKb antagonist displaying the above-described

pharmacological properties is likely to find utility as a
treatment for prostate cancer.
