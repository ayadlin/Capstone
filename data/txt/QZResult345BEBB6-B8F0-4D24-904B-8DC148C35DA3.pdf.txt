Abstract
Kaposi’s sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is associated
with three different human malignancies, including Kaposi’s
sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric
Castleman’s disease. The KS lesion is of endothelial cell in
origin and is highly dependent on autocrine and paracrine
factors for survival and growth. In this study, we show that
KSHV infection of endothelial cells induces the activation of
the prosurvival phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/
mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. KSHV infection of
endothelial cells augmented cell survival in the presence of
apoptotic inducers, including etoposide and staurosporine,
and under conditions of serum deprivation. We found that
KSHV infection of endothelial cells also increased the ability
of these cells to form an in vitro tubular network under
conditions of stress and growth factor deprivation. Finally,
we show that the nuclear factor-KB and PI3K pathways are
also required for endothelial tubular network formation.
Collectively, these results suggest that KSHV infection of
endothelial cells modulates cell signaling pathways and
induces cell survival and angiogenesis, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis induced by KSHV. [Cancer Res 2008;
68(12):4640–8]

Introduction
Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS)–associated herpesvirus (KSHV/HHV-8) is
a gammaherpesvirus first identified from KS biopsies (1). Since its
discovery, KSHV has been found in all epidemiologic forms of KS,
and viral genomic DNA is present in AIDS-associated KS as well as
HIV-negative classic and transplant-associated KS (2). KSHV is also
linked to two lymphoproliferative diseases: primary effusion
lymphomas (PEL) and multicentric Castleman’s disease (3, 4).
Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels from a
preexisting microvascular network. Angiogenesis is important for
many normal physiologic processes such as organ development
and wound healing (5). Many tumors usurp this process, and
angiogenesis is central for tumor growth and metastasis.
KS is a highly inflammatory and angiogenic vascular tumor with
characteristic spindle cells that are of endothelial origin. The KS
lesion has been shown to express high levels of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (bFGF/FGF-2),
which are necessary for the maintenance of the lesion (6).
Furthermore, antiangiogenic therapies are currently being used
for treatment of KS (7).

The angiogenic potential of several genes of KSHV has also been
investigated. KSHV G protein–coupled receptor (vGPCR) is a
homologue of human interleukin-8 (IL-8) receptor and can induce
constitutive, ligand-independent signaling activity. Signaling by
vGPCR results in elaboration of many mitogenic and angiogenic
cytokines that are vital to KSHV biology and KSHV-driven
malignancies. vIL6, a homologue of human IL-6, has also been
implicated in the development of tumorigenesis and angiogenesis
(8). Our recent studies have shown that the K1 protein of KSHV
induces the secretion of VEGF, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and
also enhances angiogenesis and tumor size in vivo (9).
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway
plays an important role in cell growth and survival. PI3K is a
heterodimer composed of a catalytic subunit (p110) and an adaptor/
regulatory subunit (p85), which are activated by receptor activation.
PI3K activation leads to Akt activation and phosphorylation on
threonine 308 and serine 473 (10). Akt is a critical regulator of PI3Kmediated cell survival and it phosphorylates and inactivates several
proapoptotic proteins, including members of the forkhead family of
transcription factors (FKHR/FOXO) and glycogen synthase kinase3h (11, 12). Activated Akt also enhances protein synthesis by
increasing the phosphorylation of the mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR; ref. 13). As a serine/threonine protein kinase,
mTOR has been shown to regulate cell growth, proliferation,
motility, survival, protein synthesis, and gene transcription (14).
Akt can activate mTOR in different ways. First, Akt has been shown
to directly phosphorylate and activate mTOR (15). Second, it
can activate mTOR through phosphorylation and inhibition of
tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC 2), which is a negative regulator
of mTOR (16). Third, Akt can modulate mTOR activity through the
regulation of cellular ATP levels, which leads to the inactivation of
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and TSC 2 (17).
We have previously shown that the KSHV K1 protein activates
the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in B cells and endothelial cells (9, 18).
Similarly, KSHV vGPCR has also been found to up-regulate the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway (19–21). These studies were performed
with individual KSHV viral genes, and in this article, we examined
the role of PI3K/Akt/mTOR activation on endothelial cell survival
in the context of the whole virus.
Here, we report that KSHV infection of endothelial cells
enhances angiogenesis, activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway,
and inactivates AMPK. We find that this activation of the PI3K/Akt
cell survival pathway in endothelial cells infected by KSHV confers
a survival advantage and protects infected cells from apoptosis.

resistance gene as a selectable marker. The insect SF9 cells were grown in
Grace’s insect medium (Life Technologies) supplied with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) at 28jC in a 5% CO2 incubator. Three days after BacK50
infection, the baculovirus-containing supernatant was separated from SF9
cells by centrifugation (3,500 rpm for 10 min). KSHV-Vero cells were
infected with BacK50 and treated with 1 mmol/L sodium butyrate. At 65 to
72 h postinfection, the medium was harvested and cells were removed by
centrifugation (3,500 rpm for 10 min). Supernatants were passed through a
0.45-Am filter.
Infection of endothelial cells. Primary human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVEC) from Clonetics were cultured in sterile
endothelial growth medium (EGM-2, Clonetics) with 10% FBS and were
maintained at 37jC in a 5% CO2 environment. Immortalized HUVEC were
made by infecting primary HUVEC with a hTERT-encoding retrovirus that
also expressed the hygromycin resistance gene as previously described (23).
rKSHV.219 produced from KSHV-Vero cells was used to infect immortalized
HUVEC in the presence of 0.8 mg/mL polybrene. After 3 d, the cells were
selected in medium containing 0.5 Ag/mL puromycin for f2 wk to select
for stable KSHV-HUVEC.
Serum starvation assay. Primary immortalized HUVEC and KSHVHUVEC (1  105) were plated in each well of a six-well plate and cultured in
EGM-2 with 10% FBS at 37jC. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with PBS
and cultured in endothelial basic medium, EBM-2 (Clonetics), with no
serum or supplements in a 37jC incubator for up to 5 d. The images were
taken with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted fluorescence microscope. The
number of cells in 10 different fields were counted and averaged after
trypan blue staining.
Caspase-3 activation assay and poly(ADP)ribose polymerase-1
activity assay. HUVEC and KSHV-HUVEC cells (1  106) were seeded in
100-mm dishes. After 24 h, the cells were washed twice with PBS and then
treated with EBM-2 medium containing one of the following: DMSO vehicle
control, 500 ng/mL tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa; Sigma), 100 Amol/L
etoposide (Sigma), or 20 nmol/L staurosporine (Sigma) for 24 h (24, 25). The
cells were harvested and a caspase-3 activation assay was performed using
the ApoAlert caspase-3 Fluorescent Assay kit (Clontech). A poly(ADP)ribose
polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activity assay was also performed using the Universal
Colorimetric PARP Assay kit (Trevigen). In addition, the caspase-3 inhibitor,
Z-VAD-FMK (Sigma), was used in the caspase-3 activation and PARP-1
assays. In this case, cells were grown in EGM-2 complete medium with 10%
FBS and treated with one of the following: DMSO vehicle control, 100 Amol/L
etoposide, 100 Amol/L etoposide plus 50 Amol/L Z-VAD-FMK (26), 20 nmol/
L staurosporine, or 20 nmol/L staurosporine plus 50 Amol/L Z-VAD-FMK
(26) for 24 h. Caspase-3 and PARP-1 activity was measured in the cells using
the ApoAlert caspase-3 Fluorescent Assay kit and the Universal Colorimetric
PARP-1 Assay kit, respectively.
Western blots. HUVEC and KSHV-HUVEC were seeded and grown in
EGM-2 medium, and after 48 h, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS
containing 1 mmol/L Na3VO4 and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Cells
were lysed in Triton/NP40 lysis buffer. Western blots were performed with
the following antibodies: phospho-PI3K p85 antibody (1:2,000 dilution),
rabbit phospho-Akt (Ser473) antibody (1:1,000 dilution), rabbit phosphomTOR (Ser2448) antibody (1:2,000 dilution) and phospho-AMPK (Thr172)
antibody (1:1,000 dilution). All of these antibodies were from Cell Signaling
Technology.
Tubule formation assays. A KSHV-negative lymphoma cell line, BJAB,
and the body-cavity–based lymphoma cell line BCBL-1 were grown in RPMI
medium (Cellgro) with 10% FBS. Cells were washed with PBS twice and then
incubated in serum-free plain RPMI medium for 48 h at 37jC. The
conditioned medium from BJAB and BCBL-1 cells was harvested by
centrifugation at 3,500 rpm for 10 min. Growth factor–reduced Matrigel (BD
Biosciences) was added to the wells of a prechilled 24-well plate (0.25 mL/
well). The plate was placed in a 37jC incubator for 30 min and the Matrigel
was allowed to solidify. To determine whether the cells could form tubules
in B-cell conditioned medium, 3  104 immortalized HUVEC and KSHVHUVEC were resuspended in either 1 mL plain RPMI medium or
conditioned medium from BJAB or BCBL-1 cells and were then plated on
the solidified Matrigel. The plate was incubated in a 37jC incubator for

www.aacrjournals.org

different time points, and images were taken with a Nikon T200
fluorescence microscope. To determine whether the cells could form
tubules in the absence of VEGF and FGF, the cells were resuspended in
VEGF minus EGM-2 medium or FGF minus EGM-2 medium, plated on the
solidified Matrigel and incubated at 37jC for up to 4 d. For the VEGF
antibody experiments, HUVEC and KSHV-HUVEC were resuspended in
EBM-2 medium or EBM-2 medium containing 20 Ag/mL VEGF antibody
(Sigma) as previously described (27). The cells were then seeded on Matrigel
and incubated at 37jC incubator for16 h. Images were taken with a Nikon
T200 fluorescence microscope.
For drug treatment experiments, 3  104 immortalized HUVEC and
KSHV-HUVEC treated with EBM-2 medium overnight were resuspended in
1 mL EGM-2 medium containing either 50 nmol/L rapamycin (mTOR
inhibitor, Calbiochem; ref. 28), 150 Amol/L ciglitazone (AMPK activator,
Calbiochem), 2.5 Amol/L SU6656 (Src inhibitor, Sigma; ref. 29), 20 Amol/L
piceatannol (Syk inhibitor, Calbiochem; ref. 30), 5 Amol/L Bay11-7085
[nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) inhibitor, Calbiochem; ref. 31], or 20 Amol/L
LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor, Calbiochem; ref. 32). The cells were then plated on
the solidified Matrigel. The plate was put in a 37jC incubator for 4 h. The
angiogenic index was calculated as the number of branch points in a field
for a particular treatment. Five different fields were counted for each
treatment and the number of branch points was averaged.

Results
KSHV infection of endothelial cells induces activation of the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and inactivation of AMPK. To obtain
KSHV-infected endothelial cells, HUVEC were infected with a
recombinant KSHV virus containing a green fluorescent protein
(GFP) expression cassette and a puromycin expression cassette
(22). After selection with 0.5 Ag/mL puromycin for several weeks,
we obtained a 100% KSHV-infected stable HUVEC cell line, which is
denoted as KSHV-HUVEC.
To determine whether the KSHV-infected endothelial cells
displayed an activated PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, equal micrograms of HUVEC and KSHV-HUVEC cell lysate were loaded on
SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies
directed against components of the PI3K/Akt pathway. KSHV
infection of HUVEC resulted in increased phosphorylation of the
p85 subunit of PI3K (Fig. 1), indicative of its activation. We also
found that there was increased phosphorylation of Akt on serine
473, concomitant with its activation (Fig. 1). mTOR, a downstream
target of Akt, also seemed to be more activated in KSHV-infected
HUVEC compared with uninfected HUVEC, as evidenced by
phosphorylation of serine 2448. Interestingly, AMPK, a negative
regulator of mTOR, showed decreased phosphorylation on
threonine 172 in KSHV-infected HUVEC (Fig. 1), suggesting that
AMPK is less activated in KSHV-infected HUVEC compared with
uninfected HUVEC. Thus, the net effect of KSHV infection of
endothelial cells is activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and
inactivation of AMPK (Fig. 1).
KSHV infection augments endothelial cell survival upon
serum deprivation. Because we observed that the PI3K/Akt
pathway was activated in KSHV-HUVEC and because this pathway
has been associated with cell survival (33, 34), we determined
whether the KSHV-infected cells were more resistant to apoptosis
induced by serum starvation. We subjected uninfected HUVEC
versus KSHV-infected HUVEC to serum starvation using EBM-2
medium without serum or cytokine supplements for various time
points. Twenty-four hours after serum starvation, there was no
significant difference between the two cell lines, but by 48 hours,
some of the uninfected HUVEC died and most of the uninfected
HUVEC appeared to be undergoing apoptosis. In contrast, the
KSHV-HUVEC appeared healthy (Fig. 2). By 72 hours, >60% of the

Figure 1. KSHV infection induces activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.
HUVEC and KSHV-HUVEC were harvested 48 h postseeding, and equal
micrograms of cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel was
transferred to nitrocellulose and Western blots were performed with the indicated
antibodies. KSHV infection of endothelial cells increased phosphorylation of the
p85 subunit of PI3K, phosphorylation of Akt, and mTOR. We also found that
KSHV-HUVEC displayed a decrease in the phosphorylation of AMPK.

uninfected HUVEC died and had come off the plate. At this time
point, most of the KSHV-infected HUVEC still appeared healthy
and were attached to the dish. At 96 hours (day 4), there were only
a few surviving uninfected HUVEC compared with KSHV-HUVEC.
By 120 hours (day 5), almost all of the uninfected HUVEC died. In
contrast, f40% of KSHV-HUVEC remained alive at day 5 and
maintained normal endothelial cell morphology and behavior (Fig.
2). These results have been repeated four times. Our results suggest
that KSHV infection protects endothelial cells under serum
starvation conditions.
KSHV infection suppresses etoposide- and staurosporineinduced apoptosis. Next, we determined the ability of uninfected
versus KSHV-infected HUVEC to counteract various apoptotic
stimuli. HUVEC and KSHV-HUVEC were treated with DMSO
(control) or apoptosis inducers, including 500 ng/mL TNF-a, 100
Amol/L etoposide, or 100 nmol/L staurosporine for 24 hours.
Caspase-3 is a cysteine protease that has been identified as a key
mediator of cell apoptosis and its activation is often used as a
hallmark of apoptosis (35). The HUVEC and KSHV-HUVEC cells
were harvested and lysed. Equal micrograms of cell lysates were used
to perform caspase-3 activation assays using a colorimetric assay

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (12). June 15, 2008

that measures the cleavage of the caspase-3 peptide substrate,
DEVD–7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (DEVD-AFC), resulting
in AFC, which could be detected at an emission of 505 nm.
Etoposide inhibits DNA synthesis (36) and staurosporine is a
relatively nonselective inhibitor of several protein kinases, including protein kinase C and protein kinase A (37, 38). Both of these
drugs have previously been shown to induce cellular apoptosis (24,
25). As shown in Fig. 3A, with the treatment of 100 Amol/L
etoposide, the activity of caspase-3 in the uninfected HUVEC was
more than twice that of the KSHV-HUVEC, suggesting that KSHV
infection of endothelial cells confers a protective effect against
etoposide-induced apoptosis. Similarly, activation of caspase-3 in
staurosporine-treated KSHV-HUVEC was lower than that seen in
staurosporine-treated uninfected HUVEC (Fig. 3A). Together, these
data suggest that KSHV infection inhibits endothelial cell apoptosis
induced by either etoposide or staurosporine.
Interestingly, TNF-a treatment of either HUVEC or KSHV-HUVEC
did not seem to induce much apoptosis in either cell line as
measured by caspase-3 activity (Fig. 3A). This has been previously
reported for TNF-a exposure of HUVEC (39). A20, a TNF-a–
inducible early response zinc finger protein, has been shown to
down-regulate NF-nB signaling in HUVEC and also inhibit
apoptosis of endothelial cells induced by TNF-a (40, 41). Thus,
endothelial cells seem to be resistant to the effects of TNF-a.
Further, to determine whether the apoptosis we observed with
etoposide and staurosporine was caspase-3 dependent, we
performed caspase-3 activity assays with HUVEC and KSHVHUVEC in the presence of the caspase-3 inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK. As
shown in Fig. 3B, apoptosis induced by both etoposide and
staurosporine was caspase-3 dependent because almost no
apoptosis was induced in either HUVEC or KSHV-HUVEC with
etoposide or staurosporine in the presence of the caspase-3
inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK (Fig. 3B).
We also performed PARP-1 activity assays to measure apoptosis.
PARP-1 catalyzes the NAD-dependent addition of poly(ADP)-ribose
to adjacent nuclear proteins (42). During apoptosis, PARP-1 is
specifically cleaved from its enzymatically active form to an
inactive form, and the cleavage of PARP has been shown to be a
reliable marker for apoptosis in a wide variety of cell types (43). We
performed a PARP-1 activity assay using lysates from HUVEC or
KSHV-HUVEC treated with etoposide or staurosporine. Higher
PARP-1 activity corresponds to lower apoptosis, and, conversely,
lower PARP-1 activity corresponds to a higher degree of apoptosis.
We found that the PARP-1 activity in HUVEC treated with
etoposide or staurosporine was lower than the PARP-1 activity
seen in KSHV-HUVEC treated with these same drugs (Fig. 3C). This
is consistent with the caspase-3 activity data shown in Fig. 3A.
Finally, we also performed the PARP-1 activity assay in the presence
of the caspase-3 inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK (Fig. 3D). The presence of
Z-VAD-FMK greatly increased PARP-1 activity in the etoposide- and
staurosporine-treated HUVEC and KSHV-HUVEC. In summary, our
data indicate that caspase-3–mediated apoptosis by etoposide and
staurosporine is much reduced in KSHV-infected HUVEC compared with uninfected HUVEC.
KSHV-infected endothelial cells form tubular networks
under conditions of cell stress. The tubule formation assay is an
in vitro assay for monitoring the formation of capillary-like tubules by
endothelial cells and is used to model and measure cell angiogenesis (44). We used growth factor–reduced Matrigel as the basement matrix to induce endothelial cell tubule formation under
various conditions. Unlike standard Matrigel, growth factor–reduced

Figure 3. KSHV infection suppresses apoptosis induced by etoposide and
staurosporine. A, HUVEC and KSHV-HUVEC were treated with endothelial
medium, EBM-2, containing 500 ng/mL TNFa, 100 Amol/L etoposide, or 20
nmol/L staurosporine for 24 h. Cells were then harvested and caspase-3 activity
was measured using the caspase-3 substrate, DEVD-AFC. Etoposide and
staurosporine, but not TNFa, induced caspase-3 activation in the HUVEC and
KSHV-HUVEC. However, caspase-3 activity induced in KSHV-infected
HUVEC was lower than that induced in uninfected HUVEC. B, HUVEC and
KSHV-HUVEC were incubated in EGM-2 medium containing 10% FBS, with
either 100 Amol/L etoposide, 100 Amol/L etoposide plus 50 Amol/L Z-VAD-FMK,
20 nmol/L staurosporine, or 20 nmol/L staurosporine plus 50 Amol/L Z-VAD-FMK
for 24 h. Cells were then harvested and caspase-3 activity was measured as
above. Z-VAD-FMK, a caspase-3 inhibitor, dramatically suppressed caspase-3
activity induced by etoposide and staurosporine in HUVEC and KSHV-HUVEC.
C, HUVEC and KSHV-HUVEC were incubated in EBM-2 medium, containing
either 100 Amol/L etoposide or 20 nmol/L staurosporine for 24 h. Cells were then
harvested and PARP-1 activity was measured using a colorimetric PARP assay
kit (Trevigen). KSHV-HUVEC treated with etoposide maintained higher PARP-1
activity compared with uninfected HUVEC. D, HUVEC and KSHV-HUVEC
were incubated in EGM-2 medium containing 10% FBS, with either 100 Amol/L

staurosporine, or 20 nmol/L staurosporine plus 50 Amol/L Z-VAD-FMK for 24 h.
Cells were then harvested and PARP-1 activity was measured as above. Z-VADFMK dramatically increased PARP-1 activity in HUVEC and KSHV-HUVEC
stimulated with etoposide and staurosporine.

Matrigel contains significantly lower levels of stimulatory cytokines
and growth factors, which allowed us to compare infected and
uninfected HUVEC without the complications of high levels of
cytokines in the medium. HUVEC and KSHV-HUVEC were plated on
Matrigel and allowed to form tubule networks. We found that the
KSHV-infected HUVEC formed more tubule structures than uninfected HUVEC within a 24-hour period (Fig. 4A).
KSHV is associated with KS, a tumor of endothelial origin, and PEL,
a tumor of B-cell origin. We wanted to investigate whether the
medium from KSHV-positive B-cell lymphomas could sustain
endothelial tubule formation of KSHV-infected HUVEC. BJAB is a
KSHV-negative B-cell lymphoma and BCBL-1 is a KSHV-positive
B-cell lymphoma. We cultured the two cell lines in plain medium
without serum for 48 hours and then harvested the medium for
endothelial tubule formation assays to see whether HUVEC and
KSHV-HUVEC could form tubules in the presence of the conditioned
medium from these two B cells. We found that uninfected HUVEC
could not form any tubule networks in either plain medium without
serum or the conditioned medium collected from BJAB cells (Fig. 4B
and C). In contrast, KSHV-HUVEC formed a branching network of
tubules to a significantly greater extent than uninfected HUVEC
in BJAB conditioned medium (Fig. 4B and C). Furthermore, the
conditioned medium from the KSHV-positive PEL (BCBL-1) amply
supported capillary-like tubule formation of KSHV-HUVEC (Fig. 4B
and C). The KSHV-HUVEC tubules formed in the conditioned BCBL-1
medium were also more intact compared with KSHV-HUVEC tubules
formed in either plain medium without serum, or the conditioned
medium from BJAB cells. The uninfected HUVEC formed a couple of
tubular structure in the presence of BCBL-1 cells but to a significantly
lesser degree than KSHV-HUVEC. This suggests that KSHV-positive
BCBL-1 cells secrete proangiogenic cytokines and growth factors that
enhance the angiogenesis associated with endothelial cells, and to a
greater degree with KSHV-infected endothelial cells.
KSHV-infected endothelial cells form tubules in the absence
of exogenous VEGF and bFGF. VEGF and bFGF are two important
growth factors involved in endothelial cell proliferation and
angiogenesis. Many groups have reported that infection of
endothelial cells with KSHV results in increased production of
VEGF (45, 46). We have also found that KSHV-HUVEC secreted more
VEGF than uninfected HUVEC (data not shown). We performed
tubule formation assays in the absence of VEGF or FGF to determine
if deprivation of these growth factors affects endothelial cell tubule
formation over a 4-day time course. We found that at 24 hours after
seeding the cells on Matrigel, both HUVEC and KSHV-HUVEC
formed networks of tubules in complete EGM-2 medium, VEGFminus EGM-2 medium, and bFGF-minus EGM-2 medium (Fig. 5A).
By day 2, some of the tubules formed by HUVEC and KSHV-HUVEC
in complete medium were broken; however, most of them were
maintained very well, and there was no significant difference
between the two cell lines (Fig. 5A). However, in the VEGF-minus
EGM-2 medium and the FGF-minus EGM-2 medium, there were a
significantly greater number of uninfected HUVEC tubules that were
broken. In contrast, more intact tubules could still be visualized in
the KSHV-HUVEC cells incubated in VEGF-minus EGM-2 medium
or FGF-minus EGM-2 medium (Fig. 5A). By the 3rd day, most of the
uninfected HUVEC died and almost all of the tubules were
disintegrated. In contrast, we still found some intact tubular
structures in the KSHV-HUVEC sample (Fig. 5A). Finally, on day 4,
almost all of the uninfected HUVEC were dead but a proportion of
the KSHV-HUVEC cells were still expressing GFP and formed tubules
to some extent (Fig. 5A). Thus, KSHV infection of HUVEC confers a

network under conditions of growth factor deprivation.
Because we and others have previously reported that KSHV
infection of endothelial cells results in VEGF up-regulation, we next
determined whether VEGF production by KSHV-HUVEC contributes to the increased angiogenesis seen with these cells. Hence, we
performed the above tubule assays with HUVEC and KSHV-HUVEC
in serum-free EBM-2 medium containing a blocking anti-VEGF
antibody (20 Ag/mL). We found that in the presence of the antiVEGF antibody, there were hardly any tubules formed by the
uninfected HUVEC (Fig. 5B). Although significantly inhibited, the
KSHV-infected HUVEC still managed to form a very small number
of tubules in the presence of the VEGF blocking antibody (Fig. 5B),
suggesting that KSHV-HUVEC continuously secrete more VEGF and
all of it is not completely blocked by the antibody.
NF-KB and PI3K pathways are essential for tubule formation
by KSHV-HUVEC. We next determined the cellular pathways that are
important for KSHV angiogenesis in vitro. We used a series of drug
inhibitors to treat the endothelial cells in our tubule assays to
determine which signaling pathways may play a key role in endothelial cell tubule formation and angiogenesis. In the presence of
DMSO vehicle control, 2.5 Amol/L SU6656 (Src inhibitor; ref. 29), or
20 Amol/L piceatannol (Syk inhibitor; ref. 30), both HUVEC and
KSHV-HUVEC formed tubule networks (Fig. 6A), implying that the Src
and Syk signal transduction pathways are not necessary for HUVEC
or KSHV-HUVEC angiogenesis in vitro under these conditions.
We also tested the importance of AMPK and mTOR signaling in
tubule formation (Fig. 6A). We found that activation of AMPK by 150
Amol/L ciglitazone or inhibition of mTOR by 50 nmol/L rapamycin
completely disintegrated the HUVEC cells and reduced the number
of tubules formed by the KSHV-HUVEC (Fig. 6A and B). The same
was true when we used 1 Amol/L rapamycin (data not shown).
Interestingly, 5 Amol/L Bay11-7085 (NF-nB inhibitor) treatment
killed the HUVEC and KSHV-HUVEC and did not support tubule
formation in either cell type (Fig. 6A and B). Furthermore,
20 Amol/L LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) treatment resulted in a
modest effect on the tubule formation of uninfected HUVEC,
although most of the cells seemed unhealthy. In contrast, most of
the KSHV-HUVEC died and could not form intact tubules with
LY294002 treatment (Fig. 6A and B). These data suggest that the
KSHV-HUVEC cells are more sensitive to inhibition of the PI3K
signaling pathway than uninfected HUVEC. Thus, the NF-nB,
PI3K, mTOR, and AMPK proteins are important for the viability
and angiogenic properties of endothelial cells.

activate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in B cells and
endothelial cells, and immortalize primary HUVEC (9, 18, 20, 21).
Because activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway has been linked to
cell survival events, we investigated whether the KSHV-infected

Discussion
To proliferate in an uncontrolled fashion, many cancer cells not
only bypass cell cycle checkpoints but also inhibit apoptotic pathways, thereby ensuring their survival (see review by Bocchetta and
Carbone in ref. 47). KSHV is associated with three different
malignancies in the human population. In this report, we have
evaluated the ability of KSHV to protect endothelial cells from
different apoptotic stimuli.
It is well established that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway
regulates cell proliferation and cell survival (33). Here, we report
that KSHV infection of endothelial cells induces activation of the
PI3K and Akt kinases compared with uninfected cells. KSHVinfected cells also show a decreased activation of AMPK and an
increase in phosphorylation and activation of mTOR. Previous
studies have shown that two KSHV oncoproteins, vGPCR and K1,

and KSHV-HUVEC in endothelial cell complete medium, medium without VEGF, or medium without bFGF for 4 d. Images of the HUVEC and KSHV-HUVEC cells
were taken under bright field microscopy. Additionally, images of the KSHV-HUVEC (which express GFP) were taken under fluorescence microscopy. The following
time points were taken: 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h. Images were taken at 10 magnification. The tubules formed by KSHV-HUVEC were maintained on Matrigel
for a longer period of time compared with those formed by HUVEC. B, tubule formation assays were performed with HUVEC and KSHV-HUVEC in serum-free EBM-2
medium, with or without anti-VEGF antibody. Images were taken after 16 h at 4 magnification. Uninfected HUVEC could not form tubules in the presence of the
blocking VEGF antibody. Although overall numbers of tubules were greatly reduced, KSHV-infected HUVEC could still form a few tubules in the presence of the
blocking antibody.

KSHV Confers a Survival Advantage to Endothelial Cells

cells had a cell survival advantage over uninfected cells under
conditions of cell stress. We found that the KSHV-infected HUVEC
were protected from serum starvation for a longer period of time
compared with uninfected HUVEC and a significantly higher
proportion of the KSHV-infected cells were alive 5 days after serum
starvation compared with uninfected cells. Furthermore, the KSHVHUVEC were more resistant to etoposide- and staurosporineinduced cell death compared with uninfected HUVEC as measured
by caspase-3 and PARP-1 activity assays.
We also evaluated the ability of KSHV-infected cells to mediate
angiogenesis under suboptimal conditions using in vitro tubule
formation assays. In all experiments, KSHV-infected cells could
form more tubules in the absence of serum, or in conditioned spent
medium from KSHV-negative BJAB cells and KSHV-positive BCBL1 cells, than uninfected HUVEC. This is likely because several KSHV
viral proteins have been shown to increase VEGF expression and
secretion (20, 23) and, hence, KSHV-infected cells may be less
dependent on external growth factors than uninfected cells.
Interestingly, in the presence of conditioned medium from BCBL1 cells (and no exogenous growth factor addition), both uninfected
HUVEC and KSHV-infected HUVEC could form tubules, with the
latter forming a significantly higher number of tubules. KSHVinfected PEL have previously been shown to secrete cytokines and
growth factors such as VEGF and IL-6 (8, 28) in the supernatant
that likely facilitates this endothelial tubule formation.
Additionally, the KSHV-infected HUVEC could also form more
tubules than uninfected cells when either VEGF or bFGF was removed
from the endothelial cell medium or when a blocking VEGF antibody
was added to the medium. Moreover, the KSHV-HUVEC maintained
their tubule structures in the absence of VEGF or bFGF for a longer
period of time (up to 4 days) compared with uninfected cells. It has
previously been shown that KS lesions have high levels of expression
of VEGF and bFGF and this suggests that VEGF secreted from infected
cells contributes to endothelial cell survival and angiogenesis.
Finally, it seems that the PI3K and NF-nB pathways are critical for
KSHV-induced tubule formation. We performed tubule formation
assays in the presence of inhibitors of Syk, Src, PI3K, mTOR, and
NF-nB, as well as an activator of AMPK. The Src and Syk inhibitors
did not show any effect on the ability of the KSHV-HUVEC or
uninfected HUVEC to form tubules. However, inhibitors of PI3K
(LY294002), NF-nB (Bay11-7085), mTOR (rapamycin), and an AMPK
activator (ciglitazone) either inhibited or reduced the ability of
KSHV-HUVEC from forming tubules. NF-kB inhibition completely
obliterated the KSHV-HUVEC and uninfected HUVEC from forming
tubules, suggesting that this pathway is essential for angiogenesis.
Interestingly, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 reduced the ability of
uninfected HUVEC to form tubules, but the KSHV-infected HUVEC
were much more susceptible to PI3K inhibition, suggesting that
these cells are highly dependent on PI3K activation. Weinstein and
colleagues originally proposed the concept of oncogene addition in
which cancer cells often rely on the activation of a specific signaling
pathway. They suggest that inhibition of this specific pathway leads
to preferential death of the cancer cell over a normal cell (48). A
similar situation may be occurring in the KSHV-infected endothelial
cells where they are more sensitive to PI3K inhibition than normal
cells. This implies that therapeutic targets that inhibit members of
the PI3K signaling pathway may be beneficial in the clinic against KS.
Indeed, sirolimus (Rapamycin), which targets mTOR, the downstream effector of the PI3K and Akt kinases, has been shown to be
efficacious against KS (28, 49). Further, we have recently published
that rapamycin is also effective against PEL and can inhibit PEL cell

(mTOR inhibitor), 150 Amol/L ciglitazone (AMPK activator), 2.5 Amol/L SU6656
(Src inhibitor), 20 Amol/L piceatannol (Syk inhibitor), 5 Amol/L Bay11-7085
(NF-nB inhibitor), or 20 Amol/L LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor). Images of the HUVEC
and KSHV-HUVEC cells under bright field were taken at 4 h. KSHV-HUVEC
were also imaged under fluorescence microscopy. Images shown were taken
at 4 magnification. B, the angiogenic index, which reflects the number of

growth in vitro and tumor formation in immunocompromised mice
(28, 49). The data presented here show that the rapamycin inhibition
of mTOR reduces the number of tubules formed by KSHV-infected
HUVEC by 50%. Further, inhibition of the upstream kinase PI3K
using LY294002 completely inhibited KSHV-HUVEC tubule formation. This suggests that inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway
may prove efficacious against a broad spectrum of KSHV-associated
cancers, including PEL and KS.
Taken together, our results provide compelling evidence that
KSHV infection activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in
endothelial cells and confers a cell survival and angiogenic
advantage to these cells.
