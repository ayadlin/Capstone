Abstract
Development of targeted therapeutics required translationally relevant preclinical models with well-characterized cancer
genome alterations. Here, by studying 52 colorectal patientderived tumor xenografts (PDX), we examined key molecular
alterations of the IGF2–PI3K and ERBB–RAS pathways and
response to cetuximab. PDX molecular data were compared
with that published for patient colorectal tumors in The Cancer
Genome Atlas. We demonstrated a signiﬁcant pattern of mutual
exclusivity of genomic abnormalities in the IGF2–PI3K and
ERBB–RAS pathways. The genomic anomaly frequencies
observed in microsatellite stable PDX reproduce those detected
in nonhypermutated patient tumors. We found frequent IGF2
upregulation (16%), which was mutually exclusive with IRS2,
PIK3CA, PTEN, and INPP4B alterations, supporting IGF2 as a

potential drug target. In addition to maintaining the genomic
and histologic diversity, correct preclinical models need to
reproduce drug response observed in patients. Responses of
PDXs to cetuximab recapitulate also clinical data in patients,
with partial or complete response in 15% (8 of 52) of PDXs and
response strictly restricted to KRAS wild-type models. The
response rate reaches 53% (8 of 15) when KRAS, BRAF, and
NRAS mutations are concomitantly excluded, proving a functional cross-validation of predictive biomarkers obtained retrospectively in patients. Collectively, these results show that,
because of their clinical relevance, colorectal PDXs are appropriate tools to identify both new targets, like IGF2, and predictive biomarkers of response/resistance to targeted therapies.

to metastasis development. Comprehensive molecular characterization of colorectal cancer has identiﬁed key gene and pathway
alterations important for initiation and progression of colorectal
cancer, including alterations in the PI3K and ERBB–RAS pathways
(1, 2). Some genetic anomalies have been also shown to predict
response to speciﬁc therapies, such as activating mutations in
KRAS, which predict resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (MAb; ref. 3). For efﬁcient development of new therapies
and companion biomarkers, preclinical models mimicking the
molecular epidemiology and drug sensitivity of human tumors
are needed.
In colorectal cancer, tumor-speciﬁc patient-derived xenograft
(PDX) models have shown to retain the intratumoral clonal
heterogeneity, chromosomal instability, and histology of the
parent tumor through passages in mice (4–7). To extend these
observations, we investigated here a collection of 52 colorectal
PDXs (6), composed of 48 microsatellite stability (MSS) and four
microsatellite instability (MSI) tumors, for the presence and
prevalence of molecular features reported in large colorectal
cancer patient cohorts (1, 2, 8). In particular, we studied key
alterations in IGF2–PI3K and ERBB–RAS pathways and the role of
these alterations in predicting response to cetuximab.

IGF2–PI3K and ERBB–RAS Alterations in Colorectal Tumorgrafts

engraftment in immunodeﬁcient CB17-SCID mice (Charles River
Laboratories). Xenografts, passage P6-P9, were harvested from 3
mice for each model, when they reached around 150 to 300 mm3
in size for RNA and DNA extraction. For in vivo pharmacological
studies, cetuximab (Imclone) was given at 12.5 mg/kg/adm,
(Q3D2) 2 i.p.), mice bearing 100 to 200 mm3 tumors at start
of therapy (n ¼ 8–10 per group) as already described (6). All
experimental procedures were approved by Sanoﬁ Laboratory
Animal Care and Use committee.
MSI status
MSI testing was performed according to the National Cancer
Institute guidelines using a ﬁve-microsatellite consensus panel
(6).
DNA sequencing
Next-generation sequencing and mutation calling were performed at Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI). Library preparation was performed using exome capture Agilent SureSelect All
Exon 50M. Libraries were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq
platform. Quality single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling criteria have been applied: SNP quality is equal or greater
than 20; the minimum sequencing depth is 4 and the mean is
100, with 99% of coverage target region. To evaluate and
eliminate the false-positive SNPs calls generated by cross
hybridization with mouse DNA, we have detected and ﬁltered
out reads aligned to mouse reference sequences before doing
human whole-exome sequencing analysis; by this way, only
speciﬁc human calling are considerate. Besides, KRAS, BRAF,
and PIK3CA mutations were validated by Sanger method in a
different tumor sample.
CGH array analysis
Evaluation of genome-wide, gene copy number was performed
using the 250k and 400k oligonucleotide CGH array Agilent
technology using two biologic duplicates and two independent
experiments. Oligonucleotide array CGH processing was performed as detailed in the manufacturer's protocol (version 6.2
October 2009; http://www.agilent.com). The log2 ratio and segmentation were generated using Array Studio software. Array
Studio, Array Viewer, Array Server, and all other Omicsoft products or service names are registered trademarks or trademarks of
Omicsoft Corporation.
Gene expression proﬁling
The analysis of gene expression was done using U133 Plus
Affymetrix microarrays with biologic triplicate (three tumor tissues removed from three distinct mice for each model, passage
P6-P9).
Real-time RT-PCR
Affymetrix data of candidate genes were conﬁrmed by qRT-PCR
using previously described methodology (9).
Immunohistochemistry
PTEN and INPP4B expression were determined on 4-mmthick AFA-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded sections. Antigen retrieval
was done by incubating tissue sections in an 850-Watt microwave oven for 36 minutes in Tris–EDTA or in citrate buffer for
INPP4B and PTEN staining, respectively. Tissue sections were

then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with primary
antibodies (anti-INPP4B, clone EPR3108Y, dilution 1:50, rabbit mAb, LSBio; anti-PTEN, clone SP218, dilution 1:50, rabbit
mAb, Spring). Staining was revealed by using OmniMap HRP
anti-Rabbit (Ventana Medical Systems) and diaminobenzidine
(Dako) as chromogen.

Results and Discussion
Comprehensive molecular characterization of tumor samples
from colorectal cancer patients has identiﬁed a handful of recurrent mutated genes within critical pathways (1, 2, 10). Among
these, the PI3K and ERBB–RAS signaling, accurately dissected by
the Cancer Genome Atlas Network (TCGA; ref. 2), provide promising therapeutic targets.
To gain more insight into the genomic abnormalities within the
PI3K and ERBB–RAS signaling pathways, a large cohort of 52
colorectal PDXs established by the CReMEC consortium (48 MSS
and four MSI tumors; ref. 6) was analyzed.
We ﬁrst examined six genes identiﬁed as key upstream elements
in the PI3K pathway (2): IGF2, IRS2, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PTEN, and
INPP4B (Fig. 1A, Table 1). Several lines of evidence underline the
importance of IGF2 in colorectal cancer. IGF2 is the single most
overexpressed gene in colorectal neoplasia relative to normal
colorectal mucosa (11) and loss of imprinting of IGF2, one
mechanism for its frequent overexpression, is also a risk factor
for colorectal cancer (12). More recently, TCGA revealed IGF2 as
an important node in the PI3K pathway with mutual exclusion
between IGF2, IRS2, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, and PTEN genomic alterations. Here, gene expression analyses identiﬁed IGF2 overexpression in seven PDXs. As reported in patients (1, 2), IGF2 overexpression in PDXs (5 out of 7) is mainly due to focal IGF2
ampliﬁcation (Fig. 1A and B).
The binding of IGF2 to IGF1R activates the intrinsic tyrosine
kinase activity of IGF1R, which results in the phosphorylation
of the insulin receptor substrates (IRS), leading to PI3K activation. Gene expression analysis of IRS1 and IRS2 revealed no
alterations in IRS1. However, overexpression of IRS2 (n ¼ 5)
was detected in mutually exclusive pattern with IGF2 ampliﬁcation or overexpression (Fig. 1A). All PI3KCA aberrations
(n ¼ 12) were oncogenic mutations, affecting all functional
domains of the enzyme but with preferential mutation hotspots within exons 9 and 20, as previously described in colorectal cancer (13). PIK3R1 mutations have been rarely reported
in colorectal cancer (2) and none were detected in the present
PDX collection.
Two PDXs showed PTEN homozygous deletion associated
with loss of protein expression, whereas no PTEN mutation was
detected (Fig. 1C). Recently, another lipid phosphatase, inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B), has
emerged as a potential tumor suppressor in prostate, breast,
and ovarian cancers (14). Downregulation of INPP4B gene
expression was detected here in two PDXs, with concomitant
loss of protein expression. Immunohistochemical analyses
conﬁrmed mutual exclusion between PTEN and INPP4B downexpression (Fig. 1C).
Interestingly, a pattern of mutual exclusion in the PI3K pathway
also exists between IGF2, IRS2, PIK3CA, PTEN, and INPP4B
alterations. These data imply that therapeutic targeting of the
IGF2 pathway could inhibit PI3K activity and suggest INPP4B as a
tumor suppressor gene in colorectal cancer.

Molecular alterations of the IGF2–PI3K and ERBB–RAS pathways in MSS and MSI colorectal cancer xenografts. A, genomic alterations of the IGF2–PI3K and
ERBB–RAS pathways. Mutations were determined by NGS. Tumors were considered to be ampliﬁed if the gene copy number was >3 using CGH array analysis. Gene
overexpression is deﬁned by an expression superior to average in all PDX panel þ 1 SD. B, correlation of expression levels with copy-number changes for
IGF2. Ampliﬁcation, >3 gene copy; focal ampliﬁcation, <10 genes. C, in situ expression of PTEN and INPP4B proteins. Anti-PTEN and INPP4B immunohistochemistry
results for representative negative (blue staining) and positive (brown staining) PDXs. Magniﬁcation, 40.

Mutations or gene ampliﬁcation of candidate genes in the
ERBB–RAS pathway was then analyzed. EGFR displayed no mutations but gene ampliﬁcation associated with gene overexpression
in two MSS PDXs. No mutation was identiﬁed in ERBB2, but one
PDX showed ERBB2 ampliﬁcation, accompanied by overexpression. Two PDXs displayed a T389I ERBB3 mutation, probably
damaging (PolyPhen prediction software). No gene alteration
was present in ERBB4.
We found that 69% (33 of 48) of MSS tumors and 100% (4 of
4) of MSI tumors have oncogenic alterations in KRAS, NRAS, or
BRAF with a signiﬁcant pattern of mutual exclusion (Fig. 1A). In
accordance with published data, KRAS missense mutations in
codons 12, 13, and 61 were the most frequent KRAS mutations
(observed mutated in 18, 5 and two PDX models, respectively).
Two additional PDXs showed two oncogenic KRAS mutations,
K117N and A146T, previously reported in colorectal cancer with
similar low frequencies (1, 15). Six PDXs displayed NRAS muta-

tions, with all mutations occurring in codon 61. Six PDXs displayed BRAF mutations: four of these were the frequent hot-spot
V600E mutation and two were less frequent mutations, D594N
and G469A, already reported in colorectal cancer (16). BRAF
V600E mutations were associated with MSI, as this mutation was
present in 75% (3 of 4) of MSI tumors compared with 2% (1 of
48) of MSS tumors, (P < 0.0001, Yates x2 test). BRAF V600E
mutations were mutually exclusive from KRAS and NRAS mutations as usually described (16).
Finally, we observed no signiﬁcant association of alterations in
the RAS and PI3K pathways, suggesting that simultaneous inhibition of the RAS and PI3K pathways might be necessary for
successful therapy in the subgroup displaying cooccurrence of
these molecular alterations.
These genomic analyses enable an assessment of the diversity
and the frequency of genomic changes altering these two major
signaling pathways in our colorectal cancer PDX models and

Figure 2.
Diversity and frequency of genetic changes leading to deregulation of
IGF2–PI3K and ERBB–RAS signaling pathways in the colorectal cancer
patient-derived xenograft panel compared with published human tumors.
MSS xenografts were analyzed for somatic mutations (ERBB2, ERBB3, KRAS,
NRAS, BRAF V600E, PIK3CA, PIK3R1), homozygous deletion (PTEN),
ampliﬁcations (IGF2, ERBB2), and signiﬁcant gene overexpression
(IGF2, IRS2). Alteration frequencies are expressed as a percentage of the
50 MSS xenografts in blue. Data obtained in nonhypermutated patient tumor
samples reported by TCGA (2) are noted in red.

comparison with TCGA data (Fig. 2). TCGA has reported that 77%
(23 of 30) of hypermutated tumors are MSI tumors (2). As the
present PDX collection displays a low frequency of MSI tumors (4
of 52, 8%) close to that of patient tumors (23 of 224, 10%; ref. 2),
we focused on MSS PDX and patient tumors. The frequency of
studied molecular epidemiology data from these two groups
showed remarkable concurrence, suggesting that the PDX bank
represents a useful set of preclinical models for testing new
therapies and emphasizing the potential therapeutic value of
targeting IGF2 in colorectal cancer. In the same way, recent
analyses by the Bodmer laboratory have shown that in vitro
colorectal cancer cell lines provide useful preclinical tools because
of well represented genetic diversity of patient tumors in cell lines
(17, 18). It led us to an analysis of gene abnormalities speciﬁcally
within IGF2–PI3K pathway in a large panel of 62 human colorectal cancer cell lines using the Broad–Novartis Cancer Cell Line
Encyclopedia data (http://www.broadinstitute.org/ccle/home).
We carefully separated MSS and MSI cell lines because of overpresentation of MSI cell lines, which could interfere with mutation frequencies. IGF2–PI3K pathway alterations appear almost
mutually exclusive within the 36 MSS cell lines with some
redundancy between PIK3CA activating mutations and IRS2 overexpression (Supplementary Fig. S1). Whereas PIK3CA, PTEN, and
PIK3R1 aberration proﬁles recapitulate the patient tumor observation, the frequencies of IGF2 and IRS2 upregulation in MSS
colorectal cancer cell lines are under- and overrepresented,
respectively.
In addition to maintaining the genomic and histologic
heterogeneity, translationally relevant preclinical models need
to reproduce drug response observed in patients. Although
KRAS mutations had been identiﬁed as a strong predictive

1564 Cancer Res; 75(8) April 15, 2015

biomarker of resistance to cetuximab and panitumumab (3),
only a subset of KRAS wild-type (WT) patients respond to antiEGFR MAbs, underlining that additional predictive biomarkers
exist within KRAS WT tumors. The characterization of alterations occurring in additional candidate genes (NRAS, BRAF,
PIK3CA, PTEN) increased indeed the negative predictive value
up to 70%, but it is not sufﬁcient to identify all resistant cases
(19).
To assess drug response prediction in our PDX models,
cetuximab response was analyzed in the PDX panel. To be
consistent with clinical criteria, we considered responders the
PDXs displaying partial or complete response and nonresponders the PDXs displaying growth stabilization or progression
(Supplementary Fig. S2). With these scoring criteria, eight out
of 52 PDXs (15%) were responders to cetuximab, with complete tumor disappearance in three PDX models. The all eight
responders were WT KRAS tumors (Figs. 1A and 3), outlining
the requirement of WT KRAS genotype for clinical beneﬁt. This
low proportion of PDX responders in an unselected population
(15%) is highly concordant with patient data (8) and PDX data
from an independent metastatic colorectal cancer xenograft
series (7). Noteworthy, cetuximab has been shown to be active
against KRAS-mutated xenografts (6), leading to a statistically
signiﬁcant reduced tumor growth but with no tumor shrinkage.
This kind of PDX response means nevertheless progressive
disease from a clinical point of view. Therefore, assessment
parameters have to be carefully analyzed to avoid over- or
misinterpretation of drug efﬁcacy.
The majority of nonresponder PDXs (27 of 44) showed
canonical activating mutations in KRAS (codons 12, 13, 61,
117, and 146). The Trusolino group reported similar results
involving KRAS mutations in codons 61, 117, and 146 in
primary resistance to cetuximab in a large and independent
colorectal PDX series (7). While most clinical studies limited
KRAS mutation assessment to codons 12–13, KRAS codon 61
and 146 mutations, in addition to NRAS and BRAF mutations,
have also been shown in retrospective studies to predict resistance to cetuximab or panitumumab in WT KRAS codon 12 and
13 metastatic colorectal cancer (19, 20). The European Medicines Agency recently updates and restricts the indication for
cetuximab to WT RAS metastatic colorectal cancer (not only WT
KRAS codon 12–13).
Likewise, none of the four BRAF V600E–mutated, four NRASmutated, and four KRAS (codon 61, 117 or 146) mutated PDXs
responded to cetuximab with tumor shrinkage. Therefore, exclusion of these mutations enables an improved selection of PDXs
likely to respond to cetuximab, increasing the response rate from
28% (8 out of 29 12–13 codons KRAS WT) to 53% (8 of 15) in
PDXs that are fully wild-type for all three genes, as reported
retrospectively in patients (19, 20). This study functionally cross
validates a recent clinical stratiﬁcation based on combination of
predictive biomarkers obtained retrospectively in patients (19).
These data support the utility of our PDX panel for identifying
predictors of drug response in metastatic colorectal cancer
patients.
As for PTEN and PIK3CA impact, clinical data are more
conﬂicting (8, 13, 19). In the present preclinical work, only
PTEN homozygous deletion, leading to absolute PTEN inactivation, has been taken into account. This PTEN loss occurred
within KRAS-mutated xenografts, displaying lack of response to
cetuximab. Individual contribution of PIK3CA mutations to the

absence of response is difﬁcult to assess because of the PIK3CA
mutation diversity in different protein domains and coexistence of these mutations with KRAS and BRAF mutations (13).
Moreover, one PDX with IGF2 activation and two other PDXs
with PIK3CA mutation respond to cetuximab. Among the ﬁve
IGF2-overexpressed KRAS WT tumors, only one responds to
cetuximab. Taken together, these data suggest that IGF2–PI3K
components are not biomarkers of resistance to anti-EGFR
therapies and underline the interest to combine anti-IGF2 and
anti-EGFR treatment.
Within the group of 15 KRAS/BRAF/NRAS wild-type PDXs,
further investigation has been performed for additional putative
predictive biomarkers of resistance to anti-EGFR (8, 21): EGFR
gene ampliﬁcation, overexpression and mutation; gene overexpression of two EGFR ligands (epiregulin and amphiregulin),
MET gene ampliﬁcation and overexpression, KRAS gene ampliﬁcation and HRAS mutation (Supplementary Table S1). Noteworthy, none of the patients with colorectal cancer, from whom
the triple wild-type PDXs were derived, had been exposed to antiEGFR therapy before surgery, ruling out the possibility of acquired
resistance in the pretreated PDXs. The analysis of these parameters
did not allow to statistically discriminating between the responder and nonresponder groups (Fisher exact test, P > 0.05). Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that cetuximab treatment was ineffective
in mice engrafted with the three PDX models carrying KRAS
ampliﬁcation.
Collectively, the present data demonstrate the relevance of
colorectal PDXs as models for preclinical drug development. The
PDX models remarkably ﬁt the molecular epidemiology and the
cetuximab drug response proﬁles of colorectal cancer patient
populations, justifying the growing use of mouse clinical trials
in cancer drug development and decision making (5). More
importantly, these data support the identiﬁcation of KRAS (exon
2, 3, and 4)/NRAS/BRAF wild-type patients for treatment with
cetuximab, and IGF2 as an attractive novel cancer drug target in a
large subset of colorectal cancer patients.
