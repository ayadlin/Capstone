ABSTRACT
Breast cancer is a common malignancy in women. Acquisition of drug resistance
is one of the main obstacles encountered in breast cancer therapy. Long non-coding
RNA (lncRNA) has been demonstrated to play vital roles in both development and
tumorigenesis. However, the relationship between lncRNAs and the development of
chemoresistance is not well established. In the present study, the high expression
of lncRNA H19 was identified as a powerful factor associated with paclitaxel (PTX)
resistance in ERα-positive breast cancer cells, but not in ERα-negative breast cancer
cells. LncRNA H19 attenuated cell apoptosis in response to PTX treatment by inhibiting
transcription of pro-apoptotic genes BIK and NOXA. H19 was further confirmed to
suppress the promoter activity of BIK by recruiting EZH2 and by trimethylating the
histone H3 at lysine 27. Interestingly, our data showed that lncRNA H19 was one
of the downstream target molecules of ERα. Altered ERα expression may therefore
change H19 levels to modulate the apoptosis response to chemotherapy in breast
cancer cells. Our data suggest that the ERα-H19-BIK signaling axis plays an important
role in promoting chemoresistance.

INTRODUCTION

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is a type of
non-coding transcript [1, 2]. Increasing evidence supports
a vital role for lncRNA in tumor formation. It could
regulate multiple cancer-associated signaling pathways
involved in cell cycle, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and
migration [3–8]. The H19 gene, which transcribes a long
non-coding RNA, is a maternally expressed imprinted
gene that plays a vital role in mammalian development
[9–11]. H19 is highly expressed in a majority of human
cancers, including breast cancer, colorectal cancer,
hepatocellular carcinoma, and gastric cancer [12–15],
and overexpression of H19 is often correlated with
poor prognosis of tumor patients [16, 17]. Despite its
importance, H19 expression has been poorly studied in
terms of cell apoptosis and chemoresistance. Our research

Breast cancer is a common malignancy in women
around the world. Chemotherapy has been an effective
treatment plan for most breast cancer patients, however,
the emergence of chemoresistance now severely restrains
the efficacy of this therapy. One hallmark of cancer is the
disruption of apoptosis, which facilitates both tumorigenesis
and chemoresistance. Consequently, most anticancer agents
kill tumor cells by activating apoptotic pathways, but how
this activation is circumvented in chemoresistant tumors
is poorly understood. Improvements in cancer treatments
therefore require a greater understanding of the molecular
events that either make tumors susceptible to drug-induced
apoptosis or allow them to evade apoptotic death.

LncRNA H19 contributed to drug resistance in
breast cancer

has revealed that high expression of H19 in breast cancer
attenuates cell apoptosis normally seen in response to
chemotherapy. Other studies have reported that H19
promotes the progression and metastasis of tumors in
different ways, by serving as a miRNA sponge, by altering
DNA methylation, and by controlling mRNA decay
[10, 18, 19]. In the present paper, we have demonstrated
an epigenetic inhibition of pro-apoptotic gene BIK by the
association of H19 with the histone methyltransferase
EZH2. This is the first confirmation of a role for H19 in
breast cancer drug resistance.
The progression of breast cancer is regulated at least
in part by the estrogen receptor α (ERα). About 65% of the
human breast cancers are estrogen dependent and express
ERα [20]. Accumulating data from clinical trials now
suggest an involvement of ERα in the sensitivity of breast
cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents. For example,
patients with ERα-positive breast cancers reportedly gain
little benefit from the administration of PTX [21, 22].
Improving the efficacy of chemotherapy as a breast cancer
treatment therefore requires a better understanding of its
underlying molecular mechanisms. We have shown here
that the lncRNA H19 is one of the downstream molecules
of ERα in breast cancer cells, and that upregulation of H19
by ERα modulates the apoptosis response to chemotherapy
in breast cancer cells. Based on these findings, we propose
that the ERα-H19-BIK signaling axis is involved in the
promotion of PTX resistance.

The contribution of lncRNA H19 to PTX resistance
in breast cancer was verified by transfecting the MCF-7R
and ZR-75-1R cells with H19-targeting siRNA.
The  interference  efficiency was confirmed by real-time
PCR (Figure 2A). These transfected cells were treated with
a series of PTX concentrations for 48 h, and then harvested
for viability tests using the MTT assay. The MCF-7R cells
showed markedly decreased viability when treated with 100,
1000, and 10000 nM PTX (Figure 2A). The IC50 values for
the MCF-7R cells were reduced from 4172 ± 567 nM to 982
± 289 nM in the H19 knockdown group. The results were
similar for the ZR-75-1R cells, which showed a decrease in
the IC50 values from 12791 ± 4703 nM to 5189 ± 3153 nM
(Supplementary Table S1).
We further evaluated the role of H19 in breast cancer
chemoresistance by ectopic expression of H19 in the
parental cell lines MCF-7S and ZR-75-1S. The transfection
efficiency was confirmed by qPCR (Figure  2B). At 24 h
after transfection, the cells were treated with PTX at different
concentrations for 48 h, and then their viability was assessed by
the MTT assay. Cells that expressed higher levels of lncRNA
H19 showed resistance to PTX treatment. This phenomenon
was observed in both MCF-7S and ZR-75-1S cell lines
(Figure 2B). The IC50 values increased from 684 ± 201 nM to
2313 ± 817 nM in MCF-7S cells, and from 2563 ± 1358 nM to
6693 ± 2781 nM in ZR-75-1S cells (Supplementary Table S1).
H19 has been reported to induce P-glycoprotein
expression under hypoxic conditions [27]. P-glycoprotein,
a transmembrane protein encoded by the MDR-1 gene,
functions as a pump that promotes the efflux of specific
drugs, including PTX. We determined whether the H19related drug resistance was dependent on P-glycoprotein by
using the MTT assay to test the drug response of MCF-7R
to two other chemotherapy agents, epirubicin (EPI) and
cisplatin (DDP). EPI is another P-glycoprotein substrate,
but DDP is not. Introduction of H19 into MCF-7S cells
significantly increased their resistance to both EPI and
DDP, whereas H19 knockdown attenuated their resistance
to both EPI and DDP (Figure 2C and 2D), in accordance
with the PTX results. The IC50 values were shown in
Supplementary Tables S2 and S3. Cell survival following
the stress of chemotherapy drug exposure was therefore
promoted by H19 independent of any P-glycoproteinmediated drug efflux from the cells.

RESULTS
The expression level of lncRNA H19 was
positively correlated with PTX resistance in
ERα-positive breast cancer cells
The expression of lncRNA H19 has been reported
in various cancers, where H19 is thought to take part in
tumorigenesis and metastasis [23–25]. For this reason, the
high expression of H19 in PTX-resistant breast cancer cells
attracted our attention. The Oncomine platform (http://www.
oncomine.org) is a free online bioinformatics resource of
cancer transcriptome data. We analyzed data from Barretina’s
research, filtered from the Oncomine databases [26], and
determined that the expression of H19 increased in parallel
with growing resistance to PTX in different breast cancer
cell lines (Figure 1A). Real-time PCR confirmed that the
H19 RNA level was increased in the PTX-resistant MCF-7
and ZR-75-1 cells (MCF-7R and ZR-75-1R). In Figure 1B,
H19 showed dramatically upregulation in MCF-7R and ZR75-1R cells when compared with the parental MCF-7S and
ZR-75-1S cells. However, no upregulation of lncRNA H19
was observed in MDA-MB-231 resistant cells (Data not
shown), which are ERα-negative breast cancer cells. The
table shows the IC50 for each pair of cell types (Figure 1C).
A positive correlation was evident between H19 transcription
and PTX resistance in the ERα-positive breast cancer cells.

H19 attenuated the apoptosis response by
inhibiting transcription of BIK and NOXA
Most chemotherapy agents exert their effects by
activating apoptosis. We evaluated the involvement of
apoptosis in H19 mediated chemoresistance by flow
cytometry of H19 knockdown cells. The apoptosis rates
of MCF-7R cells transfected with H19 siRNA and treated

with PTX were evaluated by Annexin V/PI staining and
FACS analysis. The H19 knockdown notably increased the
apoptotic ratio of the cells treated with PTX (Figure 3A).
We further investigated the mechanism of H19
mediated apoptosis by selecting nine pro-apoptotic genes
in the Bcl2 family as the hypothetical H19 targets. As
shown in Figure 3B, knockdown of H19 in MCF-7R
cells notably upregulated the BIK and NOXA at the
transcriptional level, while introduction of H19 into
MCF-7S cells significantly suppressed BIK and NOXA
expression (Figure 3C). The protein levels of BIK and
NOXA were similarly elevated by H19 knockdown and
decreased by H19 overexpression (Figure 3D).
Following this confirmation of BIK and NOXA
as targets of H19, we evaluated their roles in the drug
resistance of breast cancer cells by restoring the expression
of BIK and NOXA in MCF-7R cells. The transfection
efficiency was confirmed by Western blot analysis
(Figure 4A). As expected, overexpression of BIK or NOXA
decreased cell survival in the presence of PTX, endowing
the MCF-7R cells with higher drug sensitivity (Figure 4B).
Overexpression of BIK or NOXA also enhanced apoptosis

in the MCF-7R cells in response to PTX treatment
(Figure 4C), indicating that BIK or NOXA could attenuate
the drug resistance phenotype of MCF-7R cells.
We further addressed whether BIK and NOXA were
downstream molecules of H19 by co-transfecting H19
and BIK or NOXA expression plasmids into MCF-7S
cells. Overexpression of BIK partly restrained the effect
of H19 overexpression and sensitized MCF-7S cells
to PTX (Figure 4D). A similar result was observed in
MCF-7S cells co-transfected with H19 and NOXA
expression vectors (Figure 4D). These overexpression
and knockdown studies all validated BIK and NOXA as
important downstream targets of H19, and confirmed a
strong involvement of both genes in the H19-mediated
PTX resistance of breast cancer cells.

H19 was responsible for the epigenetic silencing
of BIK in an EZH2 dependent manner
We previously confirmed that H19 inhibits
transcription of BIK and NOXA in breast cancer,
however, the underlying mechanism is still unknown.

included ZR-75-30, MDA-MB-436, BT-474, and CAL-85-1. The PTX sensitive group consisted of HCC1395, SK-BR-3, CAMA-1,
HCC1954, HCC1187, EFM-19, MB157, HMC-1-8, AU565, BT-549, HCC70, HCC1806, BT-20, HDQ-P1, etc. The sensitivity of these
cells to PTX was identified by 8-point dose response curves [26]. (B) Real-time PCR analysis of H19 expression level in two pairs of

A previous study reported that lncRNA H19 suppressed
the expression of the target gene by associating with EZH2
in bladder cancer [25]. The polycomb protein EZH2 is a
histone methyltransferase that generates trimethylation at
lysine 27 of histone H3. A high level of H3K27me3 in
the promoter region is recognized as an epigenetic marker
indicating the suppression of gene transcription. The
modification status of H3K27me3 at the BIK and NOXA
promoter regions was therefore checked with ChIP assay
to confirm that H19 was responsible for the epigenetic
silencing. As shown in Figure 5A and 5B, the BIK
promoter region showed a dynamic modification pattern
in response to the alteration of H19 expression. High
expression of H19 facilitated H3K27me3 modification of
the BIK promoter region rather than the NOXA promoter
in MCF-7 cells.
We then confirmed the requirement for H19 in EZH2
occupancy of the NOXA and BIK promoters by Q-ChIP
analysis of H19-overexpressing MCF-7S cells. As shown in
Figure 5C, EZH2 binding onto the BIK promoter was higher
when H19 was abundant. By contrast, overexpression
of H19 did not increase the occupancy of EZH2 on the

NOXA promoter. Corresponding results were observed in
H19 knockdown MCF-7R cells. The attenuation of H19
expression reduced the occupancy by EZH2 on the BIK, but
not the NOXA, promoter (Figure 5D). We also confirmed
that H19 bound to EZH2 in breast cancer cells. As shown
in Figure 5E, the endogenous H19 was enriched in the
anti-EZH2 RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) fraction, but
showed no enrichment in the IgG fraction.
We further investigated the EZH2 dependence
of epigenetic inactivation of BIK by lncRNA H19 by
examining whether EZH2 could reverse the H19-induced
BIK inactivation. Introduction of H19 into MCF-7S cells
significantly decreased BIK expression, while EZH2
knockdown abrogated the effect of H19-induced BIK
inhibition (Figure 5F). The H19-induced upregulation of
EZH2 binding occupancy and the H3K27me3 modification
at the BIK promoter region were reversed by concomitant
knockdown of EZH2 (Figure 5G).
We then confirmed that the H19-BIK mediated
chemoresistance was dependent on EZH2 by transfecting
MCF-7S cells with H19 expression plasmids, together
with EZH2 targeting siRNAs, and treating these cells with

different concentrations. (C) MTT results obtained from MCF-7S cells transfected with H19 overexpression plasmids or control vectors

EZH2 knockdown partly restrained the effect of H19 and
sensitized the MCF-7S cells to PTX (Figure 5H). Taken
together, these results revealed that epigenetic silencing
of BIK by H19 was dependent on EZH2.

with 129 samples [28] showed a higher expression
of H19 in ERα-positive (n = 76) than ERα-negative
(n = 53) breast cancers (Figure 6A), which suggested a
possible involvement of ERα in the upregulation of H19
in chemoresistant cancer cells. Overexpression of ERα
in MCF-7S upregulated H19 and down-regulated BIK
transcription (Figure 6B). Conversely, inhibition of ERα
by the ERα inhibitor ICI significantly decreased H19 and
increased BIK expression (Figure 6C).
ERα is reportedly a powerful chemoresistance factor
[29]. We therefore examined the possible involvement
of H19 in ERα-mediated drug resistance pathways.
Specifically, we tested whether knockdown of H19
could rescue ERα-induced drug resistance. As shown in
Figure 6D, suppression of H19 expression restrained the

H19 mediated ERα-induced PTX resistance in
breast cancer
Elevated expression of H19 was only observed in
ERα-positive PTX-resistant breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7
and ZR-75-1) in our study; therefore, we proposed that
ERα could activate H19 expression. We evaluated the
relationship between ERα and H19 by analyzing published
patient data using Oncomine. Lu’s breast cancer dataset

the potential roles of lncRNA in drug resistance. Our
findings in the present study indicate that high expression
of lncRNA H19 may reduce the sensitivity of breast
cancer cells to chemotherapy through inactivation of
pro-apoptosis pathways.
Cell apoptosis is the most commonly activated
pathway during chemotherapy. Consequently, disruption
of apoptosis facilitates multidrug resistance. The Bcl2
family members are the key regulators of cell apoptosis.
We identified BIK and NOXA, two members of the
Bcl2 family, as targets of H19 (Figure 3B), by showing
that ectopic expression of BIK or NOXA reversed H19mediated PTX resistance (Figure 4D). Both BIK and
NOXA are BH3 only pro-apoptotic proteins located
on the outer mitochondrial membrane and appear to
be critical effectors of apoptosis  [30, 31]. Inhibition

DISCUSSION
Acquisition of drug resistance is one of the
main obstacles preventing successful cancer therapy.
Previous studies investigating the molecular basis of
chemoresistance have tended to focus on coding genes and
the functions of their protein products. However, recent
research is now increasingly emphasizing the importance
of lncRNAs as integral components of gene regulatory
networks. Therefore, more studies are needed to elucidate

of BIK and NOXA by H19 reduced apoptosis in breast
cancer cells and their subsequent sensitivity to drugs. A
previous study reported that blocking H19 expression
induced cell apoptosis [15], indicating that H19 is a
direct regulator of apoptosis pathways. Besides that, H19
related chemoresistance in hepatocellular carcinoma cells
was associated with induction of MDR1 [14]. However,
in the present study, knockdown of H19 significantly
reversed resistance even to drugs that were not substrates
of P-glycoprotein (Figure 2D), indicating H19 induced
breast cancer chemoresistance through regulation of basic
cellular activities rather than by drug efflux.
Epigenetic alterations are a hallmark of cancer, and
aberrant histone modification patterns lead to abnormal
silencing of tumor suppressor genes. EZH2 is a critical
component of Polycomb-Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2),
which is a type of histone methyltransferase (HMT).
EZH2 is responsible for generating histone H3 lysine 27
trimethylation, a modification that always correlates with
transcriptionally repressed chromatin. Some lncRNAs
have been reported to recruit PRC2 complexes to specific
loci and repress target gene expression [32–34]. In the
present study, we demonstrated that H19 could recruit
EZH2, catalyze trimethylation of H3K27 in the promoter
region of BIK, and suppress gene transcription.

BIK, a member of the Bcl2 family, is a tumor
suppressor, and its expression is prevented by chromosomal
deletions encompassing the  BIK  locus or by DNA
methylation in several human cancers [35–37]. We revealed
that BIK could also be silenced by H3K27me3 histone
modification induced by H19 and EZH2. Restoration of
BIK expression by removal of epigenetic markers via
inhibition of these lncRNAs or by DNA methyltransferases
(DNMTs) / Histone methyltransferases (HMTs) inhibitors
could therefore represent a potential therapeutic strategy for
treatment of refractory breast cancer.
The molecular mechanism of lncRNA-mediated
transcriptional regulation is complex. LncRNAs can
downregulate gene expression in a variety of ways,
including the establishment of repressive chromatin
states by associations with HMTs or DNMTs, thereby
changing histone modification and DNA methylation, and
by regulation of target mRNA stability or translational
efficiency through RNA-RNA interactions [38–41].
NOXA, another target of lncRNA H19, also encodes a
pro-apoptosis protein of the Bcl2 family, but we found
no repression of NOXA transcription due to H19induced H3K27me3 modification. We propose that H19
inhibits NOXA transcription by other not yet identified
mechanisms. Further work is needed to determine the

reason for down-regulation of NOXA in breast cancer
chemoresistance.
Aberrant H19 expression in breast cancer
could arise through various mechanisms, including
chromosomal abnormalities, transcription factor
binding, and epigenetic alterations. Here, we found that
H19 was upregulated by ERα. Previous reports have
shown that ER-positive tumors were more vulnerable to
resistance to chemotherapy agents. Several mechanisms
have been proposed to explain ERα-mediated drug
resistance, including inhibition of apoptosis and enhanced
P-glycoprotein expression [21, 42]. Previous research
has even determined that BIK mRNA and protein were
strongly induced by estrogen starvation or fulvestrant
treatments [43]. We propose that the ERα-H19-BIK
axis may be a novel therapeutic target for treatment
of patients with ERα-positive, chemoresistant breast
cancer. Despite the identification of ERα as the upsteam
molecular of H19, we also concerned the expression of

ERβ and progesterone receptor (PR) in chemoresistant
breast cancer cells. Western blot analysis showed
the expression of ERβ was not changed in MCF-7R
compared with MCF-7S cells, while PR was up regulated
in drug-resistant cells (Supplementary Figure S1A
and S1B). It suggested PR might also be involved in breast
cancer chemoresistance in related to H19. It will be very
interesting to investigate the potential contribution of PR
to the transcriptional regulation of lncRNA H19 further.
The aim of the present study was to identify new
mechanisms underlying chemoresistance in order to
lay the foundation for therapies that could have greater
efficacy. Collectively, we showed that H19 was an
important factor contributing to drug resistance in breast
cancer, and that epigenetic regulation mediated by H19 and
EZH2 participates in the acquisition of chemoresistance.
Therefore, therapies that target the regulatory signaling
axis ERα-H19-BIK may increase the overall effectiveness
of breast cancer chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Western blot assay

Cell culture
Human MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 breast cancer cell lines
were obtained from ATCC. The PTX-resistant MCF-7R
and ZR-75-1R cell lines were established by pulse
selection of MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 cells with paclitaxel; the
parental cell lines were named MCF-7S and ZR-75-1S.
The MCF-7S and MCF-7R cells were cultured in MEM
supplemented with 10% FBS, insulin (0.2 U/ml), 100 U/ml
penicillin, and 100 U/ml streptomycin, whereas ZR75-1S and ZR-75-1R cells were cultured in DMEM
containing 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 U/ml
streptomycin.

Total protein extracts were obtained by lying cells in
ice-cold lysis buffer. The proteins were separated on SDSpolyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes
(Bio-Rad). After blocking in 5% skimmed milk for 1 h,
the membranes were incubated with a primary antibody
overnight at 4°C. Membranes were washed 3 times for
10 min in TBST and incubated with an HRP-conjugated
secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After
washing 3 times for 10 min in TBST, the proteins were
visualized with an ECL detection system. The EZH2
antibody was purchased from Millipore, the ERα antibody
was from Santa Cruz, and the β-actin antibody was
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.

for the target genes and negative control (si-con) were
purchased from Invitrogen. The ERα expression vector
was described in our previous work [42]. The BIK and the
NOXA expression vectors containing their respective full
length coding sequences were cloned into a pEGFP-N3
vector for expression of EGFP-BIK or EGFP-NOXA
fusion proteins. The H19 expression vector was cloned
into pcDNA3.0.

Cells were seeded at a density of 8000 cells per well
in 96-well plates. On the following day, cells were treated
with graded concentrations of PTX, EPI, or DDP for 48 h.
At the end of the culture, cell viability was measured
using the MTT assay as previously described [44]. All
measurements were done in triplicate.

Apoptosis assay
An apoptosis detection kit (Keygentech) was used
for apoptosis analysis, following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, cells were collected, washed twice with
PBS, and gently resuspended in 500 μl binding buffer. After
addition of 5 μl Annexin V-FITC and 5 μl propidium iodide
(PI), the cells were incubated in the dark for 15 min at
room temperature, followed by immediate flow cytometry
analysis on a FACScan instrument (Becton Dickinson).

RNA extraction and qRT-PCR assay
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The cDNA was prepared by reverse-transcribing
1  μg of total RNA, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Vazyme). The sequences of primers designed
specifically for real-time PCR were as follows: H19-F,
ATCGGTGCCTCAGCGTTCGG; H19-R, CTGTCCTC
GCCGTCACACCG; PUMA-F, ATGGCGGACGACCT

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays
were performed using the ChIP assay kit, essentially as
described in the manufacturer (Millipore). Briefly, 1 × 107
cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde at 37°C for 10 min.
The cells were then lysed, sonicated to generate 200–1000
bp fragments, and incubated with antibody overnight at
4°C. Reversal of cross-linking was carried out at 65°C for
5 h, followed by DNA isolation. Quantitative analysis of
the ChIP products was carried out by real-time PCR using
the SYBR Green real-time PCR Master Mix (Vazyme)
according to the provided instructions. The EZH2
antibody was from Abcam and the H3K27me3 antibody
was from Millipore. The sequences for qChIP were as
follows: NOXA-F, GTTGCCTAAGGTTTGTAGCCAG;
NOXA-R, TCCAGGCTCATTTTGACTTACC; BIK-F,
CAAGCTTGCAGAACAGCAGG; BIK-R, TGGCATTGG
CAACAGAACC.
