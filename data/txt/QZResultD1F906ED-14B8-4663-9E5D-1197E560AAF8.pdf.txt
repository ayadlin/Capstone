Abstract
The poor prognosis of pancreatic cancer and poor sensitivity
to current therapeutics, associated with resistance to apoptosis, urge the search for new drugs. We previously described the
induction of caspase-independent mithochondrial death in
leukemia cells by Bobel-24 (AM-24) and derivatives. Here, we
explored whether these compounds induce a similar cytotoxicity in human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines (NP18, NP9,
NP31, and NP29). Bobel-24 or Bobel-16 induced cytotoxicity
and DNA synthesis inhibition in all cell lines and apoptosis in
all lines, except for NP9. Caspase and/or poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activity inhibition experiments showed
that cytotoxicity was mainly induced through apoptosis in
NP18 and through a caspase-independent process in NP9.
Moreover, in NP29 or NP31 cell lines, both caspase-dependent
and caspase-independent cell death mechanisms coexisted.
Cell death was associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production, mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome c and
apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) release, AIF nuclear translocation, and lysosomal cathepsin release. Inhibition of ROS
production, mitochondrial pore permeability, PARP-1, or
phospholipase A2 partially prevented cell death. Moreover,
cathepsin B inhibition or down-regulation by small interfering
RNA partially blocked cell death. In conclusion, Bobel-24 and
derivatives trigger caspase-independent lysosomal and mitochondrial death in all tested human pancreatic cancer lines,
irrespective of their degree of apoptotic sensitivity, becoming
the only active cytotoxic mechanism in the apoptosis-resistant
NP9 line. This mechanism may overcome the resistance to
apoptosis observed in pancreatic carcinoma when treated
with current genotoxic drugs. [Cancer Res 2008;68(15):6313–23]

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers (1). A small
group of patients are cured by surgery; however, most patients are
candidates to systemic chemotherapy. Nevertheless, pancreatic
cancer is exceptionally resistant to the genotoxic therapy that
efficiently treats other tumors (2). Gemcitabine, the standard drug

for advanced pancreatic cancer, provides clinical benefit in 20% to
30% of patients, whereas 1-year survival rate is only 18% (2).
Pancreatic carcinoma presents mutations or amplification of
oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressors that lead to
invasiveness and deregulation of cell cycle and apoptosis (2, 3).
Indeed, the levels of some bcl-2 family members that regulate the
mitochondrial pathway have prognostic value in pancreatic cancer
patients (2, 4) and play a crucial role in mediating intrinsic or
acquired cell resistance to gemcitabine or death receptors (3, 5).
Moreover, the overexpression of some members of the extrinsic
apoptotic pathway (FAP-1, FLIP) is also associated with resistance
to death receptor–induced apoptosis in pancreatic carcinoma
patients and cell lines (2, 3).
Because the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways are both
dependent on caspase activation (2, 3), the development of novel
compounds able to induce caspase-independent cell death is likely
to improve the therapeutic outcome in this tumor. We previously
identified a series of cycloxygenase and 5-lypoxigenase inhibitors
(Bobel-24 and derivatives) that are cytotoxic on leukemia cells;
however, we did not observe an association between their
antitumor effect and the inhibition of these enzymes (6); thus,
their mechanism of action is still currently unknown. Nevertheless,
we decided to evaluate their antitumor activity in human
pancreatic cancer cell lines on the basis of (a) our finding
that these compounds induced bcl2-independent and caspaseindependent cell death in leukemia cells (6) and (b) on the
knowledge of the association between intrinsic resistance to
current therapy and inhibition of apoptotic (caspase-dependent)
pathways in pancreatic cancer. We reasoned that if a caspaseindependent mechanism, similar to that found in leukemia cells,
was in place in pancreatic cancer cells, Bobel-24 and derivatives
could induce cell death regardless of the apoptotic blockade
present in pancreatic cancer.
Different organelles and proteins mediate caspase-independent
cell death (7). Thus, the mitochondrion plays a central role in
caspase-dependent (apoptotic) cell death through cytochrome c
release; nevertheless, this organelle also induces reactive oxygen
species (ROS), apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF; ref. 8), and
endonuclease G mediated caspase-independent death (9, 10).
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activation, after DNA
damage or oxidative stress, also triggers mitochondrial dysfunction
and AIF release leading to caspase-independent death (11). On the
other hand, the lysosome, through the release of cathepsin B and
cathepsin D, also mediates caspase-independent cell death (7, 12).
Production of ROS and phospholipase-A2 (PLA2) activation prompt
lysosomal permeabilization and cathepsin release (13), which, in
turn, lead to enhanced mitochondrial oxidant production and
dysfunction (7, 12).

with vehicle (control ), 100 Amol/L Bobel-24, or 30 Amol/L
Bobel-16 for 24 h. NP9 line was treated with vehicle,
150 Amol/L B-24 or 100 Amol/L Bobel-16 for 24 h. NP31 and
NP29 lines were exposed to vehicle, 100 Amol/L Bobel-24, or
Bobel-16 for 24 h.

On this basis, we tested whether Bobel-24 and derivatives could
induce caspase-independent cell death in a panel of human
pancreatic carcinoma cell lines, which display different capacities
of activating an apoptotic program after genotoxic exposure. To
that purpose, we evaluated the role of the mitochondria or the
lysosome and their cell death mediators in the induction of
caspase-independent cell death by these compounds.

Our results show that Bobel-24 and derivatives produce caspaseindependent cell death in all tested human pancreatic carcinoma
cell lines and a different degree or an absence of apoptosis,
depending on the cell line genetic background. Moreover, this
death is associated with ROS production, cathepsin B release from
lysosome to cytosol, enhanced PLA2 activity, PARP-1 activation,
mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and AIF release from the

(Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA) at room temperature for 30 min, followed by
DNA staining with 5 Ag/mL PI. Cells were then analyzed on FACScan using
CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).
Mitochondrial membrane potential (#W) assays. DW was determined using JC-1 probes (BD MitoScreen kit, BD Bioscience). Cell lines
(106 cells in 10 mL) were harvested after 16 h exposure to Bobel-24, Bobel16, or vehicle and centrifuged, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 0.5 mL
of JC-1 solution and incubated at 37jC for 10 min. After rinsing, cells were
analyzed by flow cytometry (BD FACScan). A dot plot of red fluorescence
(FL2, living cells with intact DW) versus green (FL1) fluorescence (cells with
lost DW) was recorded.
ROS detection. A time course for ROS production was done plating 6,000
to 8,000 cells per well in 100 AL culture medium on 96-well black plates with
clear bottom (Costar). After 12 h of seeding, the evaluated compound or
vehicle was added to the final indicated concentration. As a positive control
for ROS production, cells were exposed to 6 mmol/L H2O2. After 30-min
treatment, cells were incubated with 10 Amol/L DHE probe in complete
medium at 37jC and 5% CO2 and then analyzed at 485 nm excitation and 620
nm emission wavelength over the indicated time periods using FluorStar
Optima microplate reader. ROS production was expressed as relative
fluorescent units, obtained by subtracting control from treated cells.
Western blot analysis. Western blot was done using whole protein
lysates of floating plus adherent cells, as described (14). Blots were
incubated with primary antibodies against PARP, caspase-3, caspase-7,
caspase-8, cytochrome c , Bid (BD PharMingen); caspase-9, Bcl-xL
(Cell Signaling Technology); actin, AIF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology);
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Bax, Bcl-2 (BD Transduction);
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Chemicon International); and COXII (Molecular Probes).
Preparation of cytosolic and nuclear-enriched fractions. To determine cytochrome c and AIF release from the mitochondria to the cytosol,
floating and adherent cells (106/10 mL) obtained after Bobel treatment were
collected at 400  g for 5 min, proceeding as described (6). Western blot
was done using the cytoplasmic fraction.
To determine AIF translocation from the mitochondrion to the nucleus,
Bobel-treated cells were washed with PBS. The adherent cells were then
scrapped with buffer-A [10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2,
1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane;
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, 5 Ag/mL pepstatin-A, 1 Ag/mL leupeptin, and 2 Ag/mL aprotinin]
and collected together with the floating cells. The cell pellet, obtained
after centrifugation at 300  g for 10 min, was gently resuspended in
buffer-A + 0.1% Triton X-100, kept on ice for 10 min, centrifuged at
12,000  g for 10 min, and washed again in the same buffer. The nuclear pellet
was, afterwards, resuspended in buffer-B [20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8), 420
mmol/L NaCl, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L DDT, 25%
glycerol, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl-fluoride, 5 Ag/mL pepstatin-A,
1 Ag/mL leupeptin, and 2 Ag/mL aprotinin], kept under agitation for 30 min at
4jC, and centrifuged at 20,200  g for 10 min. We finally analyzed AIF nuclear

mitochondrion and its nuclear translocation. Our findings show
that, in pancreatic carcinoma cells, these compounds activate a
type of caspase-independent mitochondrial cell death that kills
cells irrespective of the degree of sensitivity to apoptosis.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents. NP18, NP29, NP31, and NP9 pancreatic
cancer cell lines were established from Sant Pau Hospital patients. NP9 and
NP29 lines were maintained in DMEM/F-12 (Ham), whereas NP18 and NP31
lines were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies-Bethesda Research
Laboratories), all supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine
(2 mmol/L), and penicillin/streptomycin (50 units/mL).
The synthesis of Bobel-24/AM-24 (2,4,6-triiodophenol), Bobel-4
(2,6-diisopropyl-4-iodophenol), Bobel-16 (4-phenyl-2,6-diiodophenol), and
Bobel-30 (3-chloro-2,4,6-triiodophenol) was previously described (6). BEL,
H2O2, CsA, Tiron (ROS scavenger), and DPQ were purchased from Sigma.
zVAD-fmk and zFK-mbmk were purchased from Bachem. CA-074 Me was
from Calbiochem. DHE was from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen).
For cytotoxicity assays, cells were grown exponentially at a density of
100,000 cells/mL and then exposed to the indicated concentrations of
Bobel-24 or its derivatives for 24 h collecting floating and adherent cells for
analysis. Control cells were treated with vehicle.
Cytotoxicity assays. We used the Cell Proliferation Kit II for viability
[2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide
inner salt (XTT) assay], following the recommended protocol (Roche). Cells
were plated at 5,000 cells per well in 100 AL of culture medium on 96-well
plates. After 12 h, the tested compound was added to a final concentration in
the 1 to 150 Amol/L range and incubated for 48 h or as indicated in figure
legends. Control cells were incubated with 0.5%DMSO (vehicle). In all assays,
we included blanks containing the compound dissolved in media with no
cells and subtracted their absorption from the experimental samples.
Annexin assays. For Annexin V binding versus propidium iodide (PI)
staining, we treated cells for 24 h with Bobel, harvested and incubated them
with Annexin V–FITC and PI for 10 min at room temperature, and
immediately analyzed by flow cytometry according to BD Biosciences
protocol. See figure legends for experimental detail.
Phase contrast and fluorescent microscopy. Cells were pretreated
with 0.1 Ag Hoescht 33342/mL medium for 24 h and plated in 96-well plates,
at 8,000 cells per well in 100 AL of medium, for 12 h. Then, cells were
incubated with different concentrations of tested compound for 6 to 48 h.
Cell and nuclear morphology were recorded at 20 magnification by
contrast (bright field) and fluorescent microscopy over the same surface
using an Axiovert-200M microscope (Zeiss).
Cell cycle analysis. Exponentially growing cells, exposed to Bobel-24 or
Bobel-16 for 12, 24, or 48 h, were harvested and incubated in a 10 Amol/L
BrdUrd solution in medium at 37jC for 1 h. Cells were then fixed in 70%
ethanol at 4jC, permeabilized and stained with FITC-anti-BrdUrd antibody

nuclear fraction. We used anti-GAPDH (cytosolic marker) and anti-PCNA
(nuclear marker) antibodies to assess the purity of the cytosolic and nuclear
fractions, and the anti-COXII (mitochondrial marker) antibody to verify the
lack of mitochondrial contamination of these fractions.
Immunofluorescence analysis. Cells were plated in eight-well chamber
slides (BD Falcon, CultureSlides) at 10,000 to 24,000 per well in 400 AL of
medium for 12 h and were then treated with different compound
concentrations for 12 to 16 h. Immunofluorescence analysis of AIF and
cathepsin B were done in adherent cells and/or floating cells. Cells were
rinsed with PBS and fixed with methanol for 1 min at 20jC. They were
rinsed again and blocked for 1 h in 1% bovine serum albumin on PBS at
room temperature, washed with PBS, and incubated with anti-AIF antibody
(1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti–cathepsin B (Ab-1) monoclonal
antibody (1:100; Calbiochem) for 1 h. Then, cells were washed with PBS and
incubated with the secondary antibody (anti-mouse-TRITC, 1:100) and
Hoescht dye (50 ng/mL). Finally, cells were washed with PBS and coverslips
were mounted using Fluoprep (Biomérieux).

Small interfering RNA transient transfections. NP9 cells were mock
transfected or individually transfected with two different duplexes of
21-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNA) of human cathepsin B with
two 3¶-overhanging TT (Ambion) or nonsilencing siRNA (Silencer Negative
Control #1 siRNA, Ambion) to provide similar transfection conditions. The
5¶!3¶ sense strand sequences of the human cathepsin B siRNA were
GAGUUAUGUUUACCGAGGAtt and GCUGGUCAACUAUGUCAACtt for the
validated (ID 105579) and the predesigned (ID 105578) siRNAs, respectively.
Transfection was done in 96-well plates to a final density of 8  103 cells per
well and 30 nmol/L final siRNA concentration, as described in the Silencer
siRNA Starter manual using the reverse transfection method with SiPORT/
NeoFX reagent (Ambion). Briefly, healthy growing NP9 cells were trypsinized and resuspended in normal growth medium to 1  105 cells/mL. On
the other hand, 0.5 AL of SiPORT NeoFX diluted in Opti-MeM I medium
were combined with 1.5 AL of the corresponding 2 Amol/L siRNA in OptiMeM I medium to a final volume of 20 AL per well according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. siRNA/SiPORT NeoFX transfection complexes
(20 AL) were dispensed into each 96-well followed by plating 80 AL of the

cells prepared to 1  105 cells/mL. Transfection mixtures were incubated at
37jC and 5% CO2 for 24 h and then replaced with fresh growth medium
before performing cathepsin B silencing analysis, Bobel exposure, and
measurement of cytotoxic effect. Optimization of transfection for siRNA
was done using the Silencer siRNA Starter kit (Ambion); transfectionassociated toxicity was always lower than 10%.
Quantitative reverse transcriptase–PCR. Knockdown of cathepsin B
expression was assessed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription–
PCR (RT-PCR). Total RNA analyzed was extracted with Rneasy Micro kit
(Qiagen GmbH) from two wells of transfected NP9 cells into 96-well plates.
Briefly, transfected cells were incubated for 24 or 48 h, supernatants were
removed, and cells were lysed with 75 AL per well of a buffer containing
guanidine-isothiocyanate (RLT buffer, Qiagen) per well. The lysates from
two 96-well plates were collected into the same microcentrifuge tube and
then processed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Reverse
transcription was done with the High Capacity cDNA Archive kit (Applied
Biosystems Incorp), and mRNA expression was determined using an
ABIPrism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) as
described (15). Predesigned Taqman Gene Expression Primer and Probe
assays (Applied Biosystems) were available for human cathepsin B
(HS00157194_m1) and the housekeeping gene hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HS99999909_m1; endogenous control). Supplementary
Table S1 describes the sequence and location of their hybridization regions.
All probes were FAM labeled. Gene expression results were calculated
applying the comparative CT method, as previously described (15), using
nontransfected NP9 cells as calibration sample.
Statistical analysis. Data on cell viability, with or without specific
inhibitors, were obtained in triplicates and expressed as mean F SE.
Significant differences between groups were established at a P < 0.05
determined using an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test.

Bobel-24 and its derivatives induce morphologic and

To analyze the mechanisms of antitumor activity induced by Bobel24 and derivatives, we assessed cell cycle distribution, Annexin V
binding, and in vivo Hoechst staining. We focused cellular and
molecular studies mostly on the effect of the leader compound,
Bobel-24, and Bobel-16, because Bobel-4 was significantly more

Results
Bobel-24 and its derivatives show cytotoxicity in all
pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. We tested the antiproliferative
activity of the leader compound Bobel-24, also named AM-24, and
three derivatives (Bobel-16, Bobel-4, and Bobel-30; Fig. 1A) on four
human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines (NP9, NP18, NP31, NP29)
obtained from pancreatic carcinomas, previously characterized for
their mutations (16) and degree of apoptotic induction by diverse
genotoxic agents (gemcitabine, 5-fluorouracil, aplidin; refs. 17, 18).
We treated these cell lines with Bobel-24 and its derivatives or
vehicle and analyzed cell viability using the XTT assay (Fig. 1B). All
compounds were cytotoxic within the micromolar range in all
tested cell lines (Table 1). The antiproliferative IC50 for Bobel-16
and Bobel-4 were the lowest in all cell lines, whereas Bobel-24
showed the highest IC50. The dose-dependent cell proliferation
curves showed a cell-dependent sensitivity to Bobel-24 and
derivatives; the NP18 or NP31 cell lines showed higher sensitivity
than the NP9 or NP29 cell lines (Fig. 1B).

synthesis, as shown by S-phase reduction (detected by anti–
BrdUrd-FITC) after 12, 24, or 48 h of exposure (Fig. 1C, left and
Supplementary Fig. S1). In agreement with this, expression of
cyclin-D1 and cyclin-B decreased upon Bobel treatment, whereas
the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 increased in NP9-treated
cells (not shown).
The level of apoptotic induction by Bobel-24 or Bobel-16 was cell
dependent. NP9 cells displayed low levels of early (f2% Annexin+/
PI) or late (f3% Annexin+/PI+) apoptotic events, as measured by
Annexin V binding, after 24 h of Bobel exposure (Fig. 1C, right). In
contrast, Bobel-24–treated NP18 cells showed classic apoptosis
(16% early and 31% late apoptotic cells).
Both drugs induced nuclear condensation and chromatin
fragmentation by Hoechst staining after 24-hour treatment in all
cell lines, except for NP9 line, which did not show chromatin
fragmentation (Fig. 1D). In contrast, NP18 line showed the highest
level of fragmentation, whereas NP31 line and NP29 line showed
intermediate levels of chromatin fragmentation. We also observed
cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, and cell detachment from the
plate after Bobel treatment in all cell lines by brightfield (Fig. 1D).
Therefore, Bobel-treated cell features were absent in necrosis (19)
and have to be attributed to caspase-dependent and/or caspaseindependent cell death.
Bobel-24 and Bobel-16 induce caspase-dependent and/or
independent cell death in a cell-dependent manner. We also
explored Bobel-induced death analyzing the level of activation of
the initiator caspase-8 and caspase-9, the executor caspase-3 and
caspase-7, and the cleavage of PARP, a caspase substrate (Fig. 2A).
Both Bobel-24 and Bobel-16 induced different degrees of caspase-3,
caspase-7, caspase-8, or caspase-9 activation and of PARP cleavage
in the NP18, NP29, and NP31 cell lines. In contrast, exposure to
Bobel-24 or Bobel-16 did not activate the executor caspases nor
cleaved PARP in the NP9 line. Whereas the expression of
proapoptotic Bid decreased in treated NP18, NP29, and NP31 cells,
its apoptotic truncated form (t-Bid) was not apparent. In contrast,
Bid was not regulated in NP9 cells. Moreover, we did not observe
significant changes in the expression of the antiapoptotic proteins
Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL or in the proapoptotic protein Bax in any of the cell
lines (Supplementary Fig. S2). These results suggest a marginal or
negligible participation of Bcl-2 family members in Bobel-induced
cell death and are consistent with overexpression of Bcl-2 not
altering cytotoxicity by Bobel-24 or derivatives in leukemic cells (6).
We next explored whether Bobel-16–induced death was
dependent on caspase or PARP-1 activity. PARP-1 activation is
involved in caspase-independent cell death (10, 11). To that
purpose, we measured cytotoxicity after preincubating the cells for
1 h with zVAD-fmk (pancaspase inhibitor) and/or DPQ (PARP-1

inhibitor) and then exposed to Bobel-16 for 16 h (Fig. 2B). Treated
NP18 cells showed increased cell viability, after their preincubation
with zVAD-fmk alone (P < 0.05), or with zVAD-fmk plus DPQ
(P < 0.01), but their viability remained unaltered when cells were
preincubated with DPQ alone. Therefore, the main mechanism of
Bobel-induced death in NP18 cells seems to be caspase-dependent,
although some contribution of a caspase-independent pathway
may exist. In contrast, treated NP9 cells showed increased cell
viability after incubation with DPQ (P < 0.001), but not with zVADfmk, suggesting that, in these cells, Bobel-induced cell death is
caspase independent. Moreover, in the NP31 or NP29 cell lines,
preincubation with either zVAD-fmk or DPQ significantly increased
cell viability (P < 0.001 to P < 0.01), suggesting the coexistence of
both death processes in these cells.
Bobel-24 and Bobel-16 induce mitochondrial membrane
depolarization and ROS-dependent cell death in all cell lines.
Since we have previously shown induction of caspase-independent
cell death and mitochondrial membrane depolarization by Bobel24 or its derivatives in leukemia cells (6), we also explored, here,
whether these compounds induced these effects in pancreatic
carcinoma cells. We stained cells with the JC1 dye to measure
mitochondrial membrane potential because of its potentialdependent accumulation in this organelle. We found that
Bobel-24 or Bobel-16 induced mitochondrial depolarization
(DW) after 16 hours of exposure in all four cell lines (Fig. 3A),
which prompted our search for ROS as possible upstream or
downstream mediators of cell death. Thus, we measured ROS
production staining Bobel-exposed cells with DHE (6), a cellpermeable fluorescence dye that reacts with a broad spectrum of
ROS. H2O2-treated cell line was used as a positive control. Bobel24–treated or Bobel-16–treated NP18 and NP9 cell line showed
ROS production after 16 and 24 h exposure by flow cytometry
(not shown). Moreover, a time course analysis of ROS production,
with the same compounds in the same two cell lines (Fig. 3B),
showed an increase in ROS production in a concentration and
time–dependent manner. At high Bobel concentrations, maximal
ROS production occurred after 5 to 10 hours of treatment. These
results indicate that ROS production may mediate the mitochondrial dysfunction associated with Bobel-induced death. Consistently, pretreatment of NP9 cells for 2 hours with the free radical
scavenger Tiron (a ROS scavenger) blocked ROS generation after 3
to 5 hours of exposure to Bobel (Fig. 3C, top) and reduced its
cytotoxic effect (Fig. 3C, bottom), suggesting that ROS generation
could mediate cell death.
Bobel-24 and Bobel-16 induce cytochrome c and AIF release
from the mitochondrial membrane and AIF nuclear translocation. Mitochondrial membrane depolarization was a common

Bobel-24/Bobel-16 Induce Caspase-Independent Cell Death

finding in caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pancreatic
carcinoma cell death induced by Bobel-24 or its derivatives, as we
have previously described in caspase-independent cell death in
leukemic cells (6). Consequently, we explored whether pancreatic
carcinoma cell death by Bobel-24 or Bobel-16 was mediated by
cytochrome c release (common in caspase-dependent death) and/
or mitochondrial release and nuclear translocation of AIF (common
in caspase-independent death). Bobel-24 or Bobel-16 exposure
induced cytochrome c and AIF release to the cytosol because both
proteins accumulated in the cytosolic fractions (Fig. 4A, left).
Moreover, analysis of AIF localization by immunofluorescence
showed a granulose (mitochondrial) distribution in control vehicle–
treated NP18 cells, whereas treatment with Bobel-24 or Bobel-16 led
to a lost of the granulose pattern in the cytosol (red) and to AIF
detection in the nucleus (orange or yellow; Fig. 4B, left). Similarly, in
untreated NP9 cells (Fig. 4B, right), AIF showed a filamentous
pattern in the mitochondria, which, after Bobel exposure became
diffused and localized in both the cytosol and the nucleus (yellow or
orange). Nuclear translocation was less evident at lower Bobel-24
concentrations (Fig. 4B, right, second line). We confirmed the
nuclear translocation of AIF, by Western blot in nuclear-enriched
fractions of NP9-treated cells (Fig. 4A, right).
Inhibition of the mitochondrial pore permeability or PLA2
activity block Bobel cytotoxicity in all cell lines. Loss of DW
associated with Bobel-induced cell death prompted the analysis of
its requirement in this process. Thus, we preincubated NP9 or
NP18 cells with an inhibitor of the mitochondrial pore permeability
(MPP), CsA, before exposure for 6 or 16 h to Bobel-16 (Fig. 4C). Its
inhibition delayed and partially rescued cell death induced by
Bobel-16 (Fig. 4C), suggesting the involvement of the mitochondrial
depolarization through the alteration of MPP in Bobel-induced cell
death.
PLA2 activity may mediate nuclear shrinkage in caspaseindependent death by various stimuli (20), producing arachidonic
acid (AA) and ROS, which may also mediate this type of death (21).
Therefore, we tested if the PLA2 inhibitor BEL could block the
nuclear shrinkage, in the absence of fragmentation, that occurred
during the Bobel-16–induced death of NP9 cells. Cell pretreatment
with BEL did not inhibit nuclear shrinkage in NP9 line, but partially
inhibited Bobel-induced death in NP9 and NP29 cell lines (Fig. 4D,
top). We also observed that the preincubation of NP9 cells with BEL
plus AA, a product of PLA2 activity, before their exposure to Bobel16, reversed the protective effect of BEL on Bobel cytotoxicity
(Fig. 4D, bottom). This suggests that both PLA2 activity and AA
production mediate Bobel-16–induced cell death. In summary, the
alteration of the mitochondrial membrane permeability, PLA2
activity, and AA production seem to mediate Bobel-induced cell
death.
Bobel-induced cell death is dependent on cathepsin B
activity and release from the lysosome. Lysosomal cathepsin B
has been proposed as a possible initiator of cell death (7, 22).
Moreover, ROS production and PLA2 activation may also induce
permeabilization of the lysosome (12, 13, 23). To explore the
possible role of this organelle in Bobel-16–induced cell death, we
analyzed by immunofluorescence if the compound induces the
release of cathepsin B from the lysosomes and whether the use of
specific inhibitors of cathepsin B activity reverts its cytotoxicity.
Cathepsin B release from the lysosome occurred after 12 hours of
exposure to Bobel in adherent cells before their detachment.
Cathepsin B (red) showed a granulose (lysosomal) distribution in
control NP18 (Fig. 5A, top) or NP9 (Fig. 5A, bottom) cells; whereas

www.aacrjournals.org

after exposure to Bobel-16, cathepsin B diffused to the cytosol
(red), losing this granulose pattern. Moreover, preincubation with
low concentrations of the highly specific cathepsin B inhibitors,
zFK-mbmk (Fig. 5B, top) or CA-074Me (Fig. 5B, bottom) partially
blocked Bobel-induced cell death in all four cell lines, individually.
To further confirm the importance of cathepsin B release and
activity in Bobel-induced cell death, we silenced cathepsin B
expression in NP9 cells. We chose the NP9 cell line because it
shows a type of cell death that is exclusively caspase independent.
The expression of cathepsin B in NP9 cells achieved a 90%
inhibition, as determined by real-time RT-PCR at 24 (Supplementary Fig. S3) or 48 hours (Fig. 5C, top) after transfection of the
validated or of the predesigned cathepsin B siRNA in these cells.
Moreover, down-regulation of cathepsin B expression by each of
these siRNAs partially abolished cytotoxicity induced by Bobel-16
in NP9 cells, compared with cells transfected with a nontargeting
siRNA (negative control; Fig. 5C, bottom). These results indicate the
requirement of cathepsin B release from the lysosomes and
cathepsin B activity for Bobel-induced cell death in pancreatic
carcinoma cell lines.

Discussion
We describe the induction of caspase-independent cell death by
Bobel-24 (AM-24) and its derivative Bobel-16 in all tested
pancreatic carcinoma cell lines, bearing different genetic backgrounds, regardless of a concomitant and cell line–dependent
degree of apoptotic induction.
Cell line–dependent induction of apoptosis. We observed
wide differences in apoptosis induction by Bobel-24 or derivatives
depending on the tested cell line despite their potent cytotoxic
effect in all lines. Thus, NP18 showed maximal induction of
chromatin condensation and fragmentation, phosphatidyl-serine
exposure, activation of caspases and PARP proteolysis, and partial
reversion of cytotoxicity by a pancaspase inhibitor, suggesting that
cytotoxicity occurred mainly by classic apoptosis. In the NP29 or
NP31 cell lines, the less intense caspase activation and PARP
proteolysis indicated an intermediate level of apoptosis. In
contrast, Bobel-induced cytotoxicity was not apoptotic in the
NP9 cell line because the pancaspase inhibitor was unable to
reverse cell death, which occurred without phosphatidyl-serine
exposure, chromatin fragmentation, caspase activation, or PARP
cleavage despite the alteration of mitochondrial potential and
cytochrome c release. The disconnection between mithocondrial
alteration and caspase activation in the NP9 line is consistent with
its inability to enter apoptosis by genotoxic treatment (17, 18) and
with growth rate changes, by implantation site in an animal model,
depending on cell cycle rather than on apoptotic regulation (14).
Activation of caspase-independent cell death in all pancreatic cell lines. Despite wide differences in apoptosis among the
tested cell lines, Bobel-24 or Bobel-16 induced mediators of
caspase-independent death in all tested cell lines. ROS generation
was an early (peak at 5–10 h) event in Bobel-induced cell death,
in all lines, occurring earlier than other mediators of cell death
and it may be a critical inductor of cell death because the free
radical scavenger Tiron blocked both ROS generation and
cytotoxicity.
Lysosomal permeabilization and cathepsin B activity were also
important in Bobel-mediated cytotoxicity, as inhibition of its
activity with specific inhibitors or down-regulation of cathepsin B
expression by siRNA partially prevented cell death. This is in

agreement with ROS-induced lysosomal permeabilization (13, 24)
triggering cathepsin B release, mitochondrial dysfunction, and AIF
release (12, 13) leading to caspase-independent death. PARP-1
activation contributed also to cytotoxicity, since a specific inhibitor
partially reversed Bobel-induced cell death. Consistently, ROS is
able to activate PARP-1, a nuclear sensor of DNA damage (which
agrees with our observation of S-phase reduction), generating the
PAR polymer that triggers mitochondrial dysfunction, AIF release,
and caspase-independent death (11, 25).
In addition, Bobel-induced ROS may activate PLA2 and generate
its product AA, which could mediate cytotocixity, because PLA2
inhibition partially prevented cell death, whereas AA restored
cytotoxicity. This is in agreement with oxidative stress activating
PLA2 and producing AA (22, 26), PLA2 activation destabilizing
lysosomes and mitochondria (13, 23), and AA inducing mitochondrial damage and permeabilization (21, 26, 27). Moreover, Bobel
inhibition of LOX and COX (6) could increase the available AA,
enhancing lysosomal permability.
Therefore, Bobel-24 and derivatives seem to induce redox
damage in several organelles, in all pancreatic cancer cell lines,
activating the following caspase-independent mitochondrial cell
death pathway (Fig. 5D): ROS generation triggers lysosomal
permeabilization and cathepsin B release to the cytosol, PARP-1
activation in the nucleus, and PLA2 activation in the cytosol, all
leading to dissipation of mitochondrial potential and permeabilization and release and nuclear translocation of AIF.
Based on previous reports that high levels of oxidative stress
trigger lysosomal membrane permeabilization, leading to caspaseindependent cell death (28) or to autophagy (29), we believe
autophagy is a possible mechanism for the caspase-independent
lysosomal and mitochondrial cell death we have observed.
However, the confirmation of this proposal will require a functional
evaluation of the involvement of the pathways known to regulate
autophagy in cell death induced by Bobel-24 and derivatives.
Hierarchical activation of cell death mechanisms in pancreatic cancer? Bobel-24 and derivatives seem to induce
concomitantly caspase-dependent and caspase-independent death
in pancreatic carcinoma cells. However, there may be a hierarchy of
cell death mechanisms: when apoptosis is not blocked, it is the
preferred and almost exclusive mechanism, despite of also showing
features of caspase-independent death (e.g., NP18); when it is
partially blocked (e.g., NP29 or NP31), it coexists with caspaseindependent death; and when it is completely blocked (e.g., NP9
apoptotic resistance), cell death is only induced by a caspaseindependent mechanism. Caspase and PARP-1 inhibition experiments support this argument. This is consistent with the faster

apoptotic death being dominant over caspase-independent death
(30) when several death programs coexist (7, 12) and with our
observation that CsA inhibition of MPP reverts NP18 apoptosis
sooner than NP9 caspase-independent death.
In addition, our results agree with the selection for antiapoptosis
that occurs during tumor progression (31), relating to K-ras
activation and p53 and p16 inactivation in pancreatic carcinoma
(2), since NP18 (Kras wt, p16 wt, p53 mut; ref. 32) dies by apoptosis,
NP9 (Kras mut, p16 mut, p53 mut; ref. 32) is resistant to apoptosis,
and the NP29 or NP31 cell lines (both Kras mut, p16 mut, p53 wt;
ref. 32) die by apoptotic and nonapoptotic mechanisms.
The introduction of this type of compounds in the clinic for the
purpose of treating pancreatic cancer could be feasible, especially
for Bobel-24, because dosage regimens of this compound, achieving
therapeutic concentrations, are well tolerated in humans. Thus, a
phase I study conducted to develop the drug as antiinflammatory
found no moderate or serious adverse events (only mild, transient,
and subclinical hypothyroidism) in healthy volunteers when given
at dose schedules yielding 250 to 300 Amol/L plasma concentrations (see ref. 33). These concentrations are twice to thrice
higher than those needed to induce cell death in human pancreatic
carcinoma cell lines (IC50 range, 55–111 Amol/L; see Table 1). In
summary, Bobel-24 and its derivatives induce mitochondrial and
caspase-independent death, mediated by ROS, cathepsin B, PARP-1,
PLA2, and AIF, in all tested human pancreatic cancer cell lines,
irrespective of their degree of sensitivity to apoptosis. This
represents a distinct cell death mechanism that has been proposed
to overcome apoptosis resistance (12, 27), either intrinsic (2, 3) or
acquired by genotoxic treatment (2, 5), which seems to associate
with its high rate of K-ras mutations (34).
