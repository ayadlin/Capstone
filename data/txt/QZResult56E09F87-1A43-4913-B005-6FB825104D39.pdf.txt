Abstract
Metastasis and drug resistance are major problems in cancer chemotherapy. The purpose of this work was
to analyze the molecular mechanisms underlying the invasive potential of drug-resistant colon carcinoma
cells. Cellular models included the parental HT-29 cell line and its drug-resistant derivatives selected after
chronic treatment with either 5-fluorouracil, methotrexate, doxorubicin, or oxaliplatin. Drug-resistant invasive
cells were compared with noninvasive cells using cDNA microarray, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR,
flow cytometry, immunoblots, and ELISA. Functional and cellular signaling analyses were undertaken using
pharmacologic inhibitors, function-blocking antibodies, and silencing by retrovirus-mediated RNA interference. 5-Fluorouracil– and methotrexate-resistant HT-29 cells expressing an invasive phenotype in collagen
type I and a metastatic behavior in immunodeficient mice exhibited high expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4. Macrophage migration-inhibitory factor (MIF) was identified as the critical autocrine CXCR4 ligand promoting invasion in drug-resistant colon carcinoma HT-29 cells. Silencing of CXCR4 and impairing the
MIF-CXCR4 signaling pathways by ISO-1, pAb FL-115, AMD-3100, monoclonal antibody 12G5, and BIM-46187
abolished this aggressive phenotype. Induction of CXCR4 was associated with the upregulation of two genes
encoding transcription factors previously shown to control CXCR4 expression (HIF-2α and ASCL2) and maintenance of intestinal stem cells (ASCL2). Enhanced CXCR4 expression was detected in liver metastases resected from patients with colon cancer treated by the standard FOLFOX regimen. Combination therapies
targeting the CXCR4-MIF axis could potentially counteract the emergence of the invasive metastatic behavior
in clonal derivatives of drug-resistant colon cancer cells. Cancer Res; 70(11); 4644–54. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Distinct classes of cytotoxic drugs have been developed
in cancer chemotherapy, including antimetabolites, DNA
alkylating and intercalating agents, mitotic inhibitors, and
other molecular interventions targeting oncogenic signaling
pathways (1). A major limitation in the clinical efficacy of
anticancer chemotherapy is drug resistance (2, 3). Drug resistance is associated with the activation of oncogenic pathways inducing survival pathways and convergent inhibitors

brought to evidence the activation of epidermal growth factor receptor, hedgehog, and Wnt/β-catenin pathways and
alterations in ceramide metabolism. Such properties are
essential features of metastatic cancer cells and cancer cell
progenitors (2).

mice (4). A comparative transcriptome analysis showed that
the gene transcripts encoding the chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) were upregulated 11-fold in MTX-resistant
HT-29 5M21 cells versus parental HT-29 cells. CXCR4 is the
receptor of stromal cell–derived factor-1 (CXCL12/SDF-1α).
CXCR4 promotes tumor progression at different levels of
malignancy including tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastatic dissemination, and homing in CXCL12-enriched cellular niches in metastasis target tissues (5–10). CXCR4
expression is a prognostic marker in various types of cancer
including acute myelogenous leukemia, breast, and colon
carcinomas (11–14).
The purpose of this work was to identify the major mechanisms responsible for the emergence of invasive and aggressive drug-resistant human colon cancer cells HT-29
selected by chronic treatment with the cytotoxic drugs
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and MTX, with special reference to
CXCR4 (4, 15). We have extrapolated our data by subsequent
studies on chemotherapeutic resistance observed in HT-29
cells exposed to the clinical anticancer agents oxaliplatin
(OXA) and doxorubicin (DOX).

Materials and Methods
Human colorectal carcinoma cell lines and patient
tissue samples
Parental HT-29 cell line, 5-FU (10 μmol/L) and MTX
(10 μmol/L)–resistant HT-29 cell subpopulations (HT-29 FU
and HT-29 MTX) and their 5-FU–resistant (5F7 and 5F31),
and MTX-resistant (5M21) clonal derivatives were cultured
as described (16, 17). HT-29 cell subpopulations resistant to
DOX (HT-29 DOX, 30 nmol/L; ref. 18) and OXA (HT-29 OXA,
2 μmol/L; ref. 19) were from Dr. A. Bosia and Dr. LM. Ellis,
respectively. Liver metastases of colon adenocarcinoma from
23 patients who underwent surgical resection of metastases
were processed by the tumor cell and tissue bank of the
Regional Reference Cancer Center of Lille. After hepatic resection, fragments were taken from macroscopic metastases
and adjacent hepatic tissue, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen,
and stored at −80°C. The whole remaining tissue was fixed
in 10% formalin and several other fragments were taken from
the fixed metastases and adjacent hepatic tissue and embedded in paraffin. Hematoxylin, eosin, saffron, and astra blue–
stained sections were examined by an expert pathologist to
establish the histologic diagnosis and the morphologic characteristics of the frozen fragments. Fragments used in this
study contained at least 60% malignant cells. Informed consent was obtained from all patients.
Collagen invasion assay
Invasion assays were performed as previously described
(4). Invasion index is expressed as the percentage of invading
cells versus total number of cells. Data are means ± SD, and
significance was assessed by the unpaired Student's t test.
Immunohistochemistry
Paraffin-embedded sections were pretreated in CC1 buffer
(pH 8) at 98°C for 36 minutes for macrophage migration-

inhibitory factor (MIF) labeling and 8 minutes for CXCR4
labeling and processed with the MIF antibody (dilution
1:200, incubation 32 minutes) or the CXCR4 antibody (dilution
1:100, incubation 28 minutes) using a Benchmark XT Ventana
equipment. Labeling was visualized by the Ultraview-DAB
system and slides were counterstained with hematoxylin.
Specificity was checked by control staining performed in the
absence of primary antibody and with several positive tissue
controls. Staining intensity was evaluated as low (+), moderate
(++), and high (+++). The Ki-67 proliferation index was
assessed in 1,000 cells at the tumor periphery, i.e., in areas
associated with the highest Ki-67 nuclear signal.
DNA microarray analysis
Human and mouse Whole Genome Agilent 44K 60-mer oligonucleotide Microarrays were performed according to the
Two-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression protocol
(Agilent Technologies). Microarrays were scanned using the
Agilent scanner G2505C and Feature Extraction software
(v10.5). Data were processed with the GeneSpring (v10) for
normalization, filtering, and statistical analysis. The genes
upregulated or downregulated with statistical significance
(P < 0.05) were sorted using asymptotic P value computation
and Benjamini Hochberg FDR multiple testing corrections.
Microarray data are available through GEO (accession no.
GSE20147).
Flow cytometry and Western blot
Cells were detached with trypsin-EDTA, rinsed, resuspended at 106 cells per milliliter in PBS-1% bovine serum albumin, incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature with
anti–CXCR4-PE and analyzed using a Beckman-Coulter Epics
XL-MCL4 cytometer. Immunoblotting was performed as previously described using purified membrane fractions for
CXCR4 (20).

Results
HT-29 clones selected for 5-FU and MTX resistance
differ in their invasive metastatic behavior and CXCR4
expression
According to our previous report (15), the HT-29 5M21
clone, selected by MTX resistance, displayed a constitutive
invasive phenotype in type I collagen, whereas parental
HT-29 cells were not spontaneously invasive in this extracellular matrix component (Fig. 1A). To further address the
effect of drug resistance on the aggressive phenotype and
expression of CXCR4, we analyzed the invasive potential of
four HT-29 clones selected for resistance to 5-FU, the most
commonly used anticancer drug. As shown in Fig. 1A,
collagen gels were invaded by 5-FU–resistant 5F7 cells
(P < 0.0001). In contrast, 5-FU–resistant 5F31 cells were
not invasive. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRTPCR) showed that CXCR4 mRNA levels were increased
135 ± 21-fold and 41 ± 11-fold in 5F7 and 5M21 cells versus
5F31 cells, respectively (Fig. 1B). Flow cytometry confirmed
a weak CXCR4 expression in 5F31 cells, as compared with

5F7 and 5M21, the highest CXCR4 expression being detected
in 5F7 cells (Fig. 1C). The two other 5-FU–resistant clones
(5F35 and 5F12) showed a constitutive invasive behavior and
enhanced expression of CXCR4 relative to parental HT-29
cells (data not shown).
The 5F7 and 5F31 clones were then examined for their metastatic behavior, using the metastatic 5M21 xenografts as
control (4). Cells were first injected s.c. in the flank of nude
mice and the primary tumors were reimplanted into severe
combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice for the analysis
of metastasis (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). 5F7 and
5M21 xenografts developed lung micrometastases (four of
four mice), whereas 5F31 xenografts were ineffective at
spreading into the lungs (zero of four mice). These data revealed that chronic treatment of the parental HT-29 cell line
by the anticancer drugs 5-FU and MTX led to the emergence
of invasive cell populations characterized by a strong expression of CXCR4.
Transcriptome analysis of the 5-FU– and MTX-resistant
HT-29 clones and their corresponding tumor xenografts
We compared the invasive clones 5M21 and 5F7 to the
noninvasive 5F31 clone, using the 44K Whole Human
Genome Oligo Microarray (Table 1; Supplementary Table S1).
In coherence with our data (Fig. 1), CXCR4 seemed strongly expressed in invasive cells with a very high fold change
(123.5). Other genes highly expressed in the invasive clones
5F7 and 5M21 were BAMBI (99.8-fold), GRB10 (96.1-fold),
and SYT13 (93.7-fold). We also observed a higher expression of several ABC transporters, i.e., ABCC2 (8.4-fold),
ABCC8 (6.9-fold), ABCC6 (6.9-fold), ABCC5 (4.5-fold), ABCA2
(2.5-fold), and ABCC3 (2.4-fold), and of the receptor activator of
nuclear factor-κB TNFRSF11A/RANK (7.4-fold). The transcrip-

tion factors Achaete scute-like 2 (ASCL2) and hypoxiainducible factor EPAS1 (encoding HIF-2α), known to induce
CXCR4 transcription, are upregulated in the invasive 5F7 and
5M21 clones versus the noninvasive 5F31 clone (3.8-fold and
2.3-fold, respectively; Supplementary Table S1). Next, we analyzed the corresponding tumor xenografts to incriminate
CXCR4 in metastasis. CXCR4 overexpression persisted in the
metastatic 5F7 and 5M21 tumor xenografts (by 61-fold;
Table 2). Transcripts highly expressed in invasive 5F7 and
5M21 cells in vitro were also overexpressed in their
corresponding xenografts, including BAMBI (118.1-fold),
IGFBP2 (63.9-fold), GRB10 (47.2-fold), and SYT13 (19.4-fold).
In addition, some transcripts showing low variations in invasive versus noninvasive cells (Table 1; Supplementary Table
S1) seemed highly overexpressed in the metastatic versus
nonmetastatic tumor xenografts (Table 2; Supplementary
Table S2). These transcripts included the matrix metalloproteases MMP1 (19.6-fold) and MMP10 (8.3-fold), the membrane serine protease hepsin (11.4-fold), and endothelin 2
(18.8-fold), all involved in invasive tumor growth and metastasis (Table 2; Supplementary Table S2; refs. 21–23). In metastatic tumor xenografts, we also noticed a stronger induction
of human ASCL2 (12-fold).
Because these microarrays were established from tumor
xenografts containing human cancer cells and murine tumor stroma cells, we performed a comparative mouse pangenomic microarray on the same RNAs using the 44K
Whole Mouse Genome Oligo Microarrays. Comparison of
metastatic 5M21 and 5F7 xenografts versus nonmetastatic
5F31 xenografts did not produce overexpressed genes with
high fold change as obtained with the human microarray
(Table 2). Concerning murine Cxcr4, only a 5-fold increase
was observed, supporting the notion that the transcripts

detected in the metastatic 5F7 and 5M21 xenografts are
mainly associated with CXCR4 hyperexpression in human
colon cancer cells.
Implication of CXCR4 in the invasive and metastatic
behavior of 5-FU–resistant HT-29 clones
As shown in Fig. 2A, the constitutive invasive phenotype of
5F7 cells in collagen type I gels was abolished by the antiCXCR4 12G5 antibody and the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100.
Downstream of CXCR4, receptor-activated G-protein subunits
Gαi, Gαq, and Gα13 are directly involved in the regulation of

several signaling effectors, including the ras oncogene, the
phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ)/calcium/PKC cascade, and the
Rho-Rho-kinase (ROK) axis, respectively (24). Additionally,
Gβγ subunits released from CXCR4-activated heterotrimeric
subunits were shown to signal with PLCβ. It is well known
that these signaling networks are involved in cancer cell
invasion and metastasis. In agreement, the 5F7 invasive
phenotype was alleviated by the Gαi inhibitor PTx, the
new G protein signaling inhibitor BIM-46187 targeting Gα
subunits downstream activated G protein–coupled receptor
(GPCR; ref. 25), and by pharmacologic inhibitors targeting

PLCβ (U73122) and PKA (KT5720). In addition, collagen
invasion was inhibited by pharmacologic inhibitors targeting phosphoinositide-3-kinase (wortmannin), PKC (Gö6976),
and the Rho-ROCK axis (C3T and Y27632). Conversely, this
invasion was insensitive to the mitogen-activated protein
kinase inhibitors PD098059 and SB203580 targeting p42/
44 and p38, respectively. Our data are coherent with the
notion that CXCR4-mediated migration of carcinoma cells
is controlled by phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt–dependent
and p42/44–independent pathways (26).
Next, we examined whether CXCR4 plays a direct role
in the tumorigenicity and metastatic behavior of 5-FU–
resistant HT-29 cells. We silenced CXCR4 in invasive 5F7
cells by RNA interference (Supplementary Methods).
CXCR4-silenced subclones were selected by qRT-PCR and
flow cytometry (Fig. 2B and C). CXCR4 mRNA levels were
reduced by 83% to 96% in CXCR4-silenced XN6 and XN3
cells, respectively, as compared with 5F7. Flow cytometry
confirmed that CXCR4 protein levels were depleted by

CXCR4 abrogated the invasive potential of the XN6 and
XN3 subclones, whereas the nonsilenced XP6 clone remained invasive (data not shown). Next, the two CXCR4silenced subclones XN3 and XN6 and the control XP6 were
inoculated in SCID mice. The depletion of CXCR4 had no

significant effect on tumor growth as the median volume
of the tumors at day 62 postinjection was 1,331 mm3 in
control 5F7 xenografts versus 1,338 and 1,130 mm3 in
the CXCR4-depleted XN3 and XN6 xenografts, respectively.
At the histologic level (Fig. 2D), tumors appeared as carcinomas with cell rows and glands containing mucus in
their lumen. The Ki-67 cell proliferation marker was found
at comparably high levels in xenografts established from
parental 5F7 cells (77%) and their CXCR4-depleted clonal
derivatives XN3 (83%) and XN6 (78%). Metastases and/or
micrometastases in lungs were observed in four of four
mice injected with the CXCR4-positive control XP6 xenografts, in zero of four mice inoculated with the CXCR4silenced XN6 cells, and only in one of four mice inoculated
with CXCR4-silenced XN3 cells (Fig. 2D). Thus, inactivation of CXCR4 by RNA interference impaired the ability of
the 5-FU–resistant 5F7 clone to promote lung metastases
in mice.
Enhanced expression of CXCR4 in drug-resistant human

To substantiate the relationship between drug resistance
and CXCR4, we analyzed CXCR4 expression in HT-29 cell
subpopulations resistant to clinical anticancer drugs. Flow

a higher percentage of CXCR4-positive cells (Fig. 3A).
The percentage of CXCR4-positive cells was 3% in parental
HT-29 cell population. This percentage increased to 17%
and 49% in OXA- and DOX-resistant cells, and to 68% and
73% in 5-FU– and MTX-resistant cells, respectively. Western
blot analysis confirmed the higher expression levels of
CXCR4 in drug-resistant cancer cells, especially in the
DOX-, 5-FU–, and MTX-resistant HT-29 cells (Fig. 3B).
The increase in CXCR4 protein was paralleled by an
increase in CXCR4 transcript, as shown by qRT-PCR
(Fig. 3B). Of note, OXA- and DOX-resistant HT-29 cells
also display an invasive behavior (ref. 19; data not shown).
Next, we examined CXCR4 expression in established liver
metastases from colon cancer patients under the FOLFOX
regimen (27) within the 6-month period prior to liver metastasis resection. Control patients were not exposed to any

anticancer drug within the 6-month period prior to surgery.
This control group includes patients who never received
any chemotherapy and patients previously treated with a
5-FU–based chemotherapeutic regimen before the 6-month
preoperative period. Quantification of CXCR4 expression
by qRT-PCR showed enhanced CXCR4 mRNA levels in
FOLFOX-treated patients (median ratio, 3.8; P < 0.05;
Fig. 3C). CXCR4 expression was further analyzed by immunohistochemistry in human liver colon metastases from
FOLFOX-treated and untreated patients (Fig. 3D). In
all cases, CXCR4 staining was detected in cancer epithelial cells and tumor stroma cells. In metastases from untreated patients, CXCR4 staining in cancer cells was
weak/moderate and localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus.
In FOLFOX- treated patients, the CXCR4 signal in cancer
cells was strong and mainly localized in the nucleus. It is

noteworthy that CXCR4 nuclear localization is associated
with metastasis (28, 29). Consistently, a nuclear localization
sequence mediates the transfer of CXCR4 to the nucleus
after interaction with its ligand CXCL12/SDF-1 (30).
MIF is an autocrine proinvasive factor in 5-FU and
MTX-resistant HT-29 cells
CXCL12 is the canonical CXCR4 ligand involved in different malignant processes, including tumor cell growth, angiogenesis, and metastatic spread (10, 14). However, CXCL12
was not detected in the native and concentrated (CM, 20×)

conditioned culture media prepared from parental HT-29 cells
and the 5-FU–resistant clones (data not shown), in agreement
with CXCL12 promoter hypermethylation in this model (31).
The expression of the MIF was therefore investigated. This
cytokine produced by intestinal cells (32) was recently
described as a functional CXCR4/CXCR2 ligand (33). High
MIF levels were detected by immunoblotting in cell lysates
and CM prepared from parental and drug-resistant HT-29
cells (Fig. 4A; data not shown). These CM contained high
levels of vascular endothelial growth factor whereas tumor

the indicated drugs, and then numbered. Treatments with AMD3100, ISO-1, and 5-FU as single agents did not bring any significant difference in cell
number as compared with 5-FU–resistant cells cultured under control conditions (without any drug). In contrast, significant decreases in cell number were
observed when 5-FU was combined with AMD3100, ISO-1, or their association, as compared with control conditions (*, P < 0.05).

consolidate the possible contribution of MIF in the invasive
phenotype of 5-FU–resistant HT-29 cells, we investigated
the effect of MIF neutralizing antibody and pharmacologic
inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 4C, the spontaneous invasive
phenotype of 5F7 cells was strongly reduced by the MIF
inhibitor ISO-1 and the anti-MIF antibody (P < 0.001).
Next, we studied the role of the MIF-CXCR4 axis in the proliferation of drug-resistant cells. The subpopulation of
5-FU–resistant HT-29 FU cells was cultured in the presence

AMD3100 or the MIF inhibitor ISO-1 (Fig. 4D). Whereas
AMD3100, ISO-1, and 5-FU were ineffective as single agents,
combinations of 5-FU with AMD3100 or ISO-1 led to a
significant decrease in cell number as compared with
5-FU–resistant cells cultured in control conditions. Simultaneous addition of AMD3100 and ISO-1 with 5-FU did not
have an additive or synergistic effect on cell growth. Consistently, both MIF and CXCR4 acted as upstream activators
and integral components of the same signaling pathway.
In all conditions tested, flow cytometry showed that the
percentage of cells at the sub-G1 fractions was below 1%,
suggesting that the MIF/CXCR4 axis plays a role in the proliferation of established 5-FU–resistant colon cancer cells,
without affecting their survival. Of note, a strong amplification of the TYMS gene encoding thymidylate synthetase was
detected in the CXCR4-negative noninvasive variant 5F31
(8.8-fold in 5F31 cells versus 2.2-fold in 5F7 cells; data
not shown). Therefore, amplification of the TYMS gene
might be involved at different degrees in the resistance of
HT-29 cells to 5-FU.

Discussion
An important advance at the origin of this work was the
emergence and characterization of drug-resistant CXCR4positive and invasive HT-29 colon cancer cells selected by
the clinical anticancer agents 5-FU, OXA, DOX, and MTX.
We report that induction of the GPCR CXCR4 acts as a major
mechanism underlying the aggressiveness of 5-FU–resistant
HT-29 cells in vitro and in vivo. Consistently, silencing of
CXCR4 and treatments by several inhibitors targeting canonical CXCR4 and GPCR pathways (25) markedly reversed cellular invasion and the development of lung metastases
induced by 5-FU–resistant xenografts.
We identified the human colon cancer cell–derived MIF
as the critical autocrine CXCR4 ligand promoting the invasion of several drug-resistant colon carcinoma HT-29 cells.
The receptor for MIF signaling was identified as a molecular scaffold involving CD74 (MHC class II invariant chain)
and CD44 coreceptor (34, 35). Both CD74 and CXCR2, as
well as the CXCR4 agonist CXCL12, were not expressed
in the 5-FU–resistant clones 5F7 and 5M21 (data not
shown), thus supporting the activation of a MIF-dependent
autocrine loop via CXCR4 in the present study. MIF, originally known as a key mediator in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses, exerts a pivotal role in
oncogenic transformation and tumor progression. The generation of MIF knockout mice showed that MIF-deficient
cells exhibit a resistance to oncogenic transformation (36).
In the APCMin/+ mouse model of intestinal tumorigenesis,
homozygous MIF deletion was associated with a reduced tumorigenesis (37). High MIF levels were found in tumors and
sera of patients with different types of cancer, and consistently, MIF production has been associated with aggressiveness and metastatic potential of human tumors (38–40). MIF
was reported to promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis through the induction of metalloproteases and vascular endothelial growth factors (40, 41).

Cancer Res; 70(11) June 1, 2010

Both MIF and vascular endothelial growth factors are constitutively expressed in parental HT-29 cells and their
drug-resistant derivatives. MIF exerts a tautomerase activity in vitro (42). We found that the invasive phenotype of
5-FU–resistant HT-29 cells is inhibited by the MIF neutralizing antibody and the MIF tautomerase inhibitor ISO-1.
Although the tautomerase activity might be dispensable in
the biological functions of MIF (43), its inhibition reduced
tumor progression in murine CT26 colon carcinoma models
(40). We have therefore shown that chemokine receptor
CXCR4 functions as a dominant invasion promoter and
metastasis progression signal in 5-FU– and MTX-resistant
cells, in a MIF-dependent manner. It is likely that the invasive and metastatic phenotype of CXCR4-positive and
drug-resistant cancer cells is also regulated in a paracrine
manner by MIF and CXCL12/SDF-1 derived from tumor
stroma cells. In the present study, the CXCR4 antagonist
AMD3100 and the MIF inhibitor ISO-1 significantly decreased
the growth of 5-FU–resistant HT-29 cells maintained under
the 5-FU pressure, suggesting that CXCR4 and its noncognate
ligand MIF are also connected with cell proliferation signaling
pathways in this model of drug resistance.
CXCR4 expression is known to be downregulated by
the translation inhibitor miR-146 (44). Specific qRT-PCR
revealed that miR-146a was downregulated in all drugresistant HT-29 cells, independently of their CXCR4 status
and invasive potential (data not shown). CXCR4 expression is also induced at the transcriptional level by the
oncogenic nuclear factor-κB pathways, the transcription factors ASCL2 and the hypoxia-inducible factors, HIF-1α and
HIF-2α (45–47). Recent lines of evidence indicate that a
small population of cancer cells harboring several traits
inherent to cancer progenitor stem cells may be more resistant to chemotherapy (2). Interestingly, ASCL2 was recently
identified as a critical factor involved in the maintenance of
intestinal stem cells (48). In 5-FU–resistant HT-29 cells,
CXCR4 induction was associated with EPAS1 and ASCL2
upregulation. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that
miR-146a depletion and ASCL2 overexpression could contribute, together with other mechanisms, to the aggressive
phenotypes observed in CXCR4-positive drug-resistant
HT-29 cells. The selective nuclear factor-κB inhibitor
GS143, which inhibits IκBα ubiquitinylation (49), decreased
the ability of CXCR4-positive 5F7 cells to invade collagen
gels (data not shown). It is therefore conceivable that
chronic drug pressure on parental HT-29 cells leads to the
selective survival and selection of CXCR4-proficient HT-29
cell subpopulations characterized by a constitutive invasive
phenotype and metastatic behavior. Finally, a recent report
established that CXCR4 transcripts are upregulated in tumors from patients with rectal cancer treated with the vascular endothelial growth factor antibody bevacizumab (50),
associating CXCR4 upregulation to treatment by another
class of therapeutic agents.
We believe that transient or chronic induction of the
CXCR4 signaling cascades by MIF autocrine and paracrine
loops might account for the important mechanisms associated with drug resistance, invasion, and metastasis in human

colon cancer cells. Consistently, human liver metastases established in colon cancer patients treated with the FOLFOX
standard regimen prior to surgery also exhibited higher
levels of CXCR4 transcripts. Thus, targeting the MIF/CXCR4
pathways in combination therapies might exert beneficial
effects to overcome the deleterious emergence of CXCR4 in
clonal derivatives of drug-resistant cancer cells. Improved
clinical outcome might be obtained in subsets of colon cancer patients that exhibit constitutive or transient activation
of the MIF-CXCR4 axis associated with intrinsic or acquired
resistance to chemotherapeutic agents during adjuvant and
neoadjuvant therapies.
