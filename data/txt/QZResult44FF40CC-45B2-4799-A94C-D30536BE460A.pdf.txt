Abstract
Slowly cycling tumor cells that may be present in human tumors may evade cytotoxic therapies, which
tend to be more efﬁcient at destroying cells with faster growth rates. However, the proportion and growth
rate of slowly cycling tumor cells is often unknown in preclinical model systems used for drug discovery.
Here, we report a quantitative approach to quantitate slowly cycling malignant cells in solid tumors, using
a well-established mouse model of Kras-induced lung cancer (KrasG12D/þ). 5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine
(BrdUrd) was administered to tumor-bearing mice, and samples were collected at deﬁned times during
pulse and chase phases. Mathematical and statistical modeling of the label-retention data during the chase
phase supported the existence of a slowly cycling label-retaining population in this tumor model and
permitted the estimation of its proportion and proliferation rate within a tumor. The doubling time of the
slowly cycling population was estimated at approximately 5.7 weeks, and this population represented
approximately 31% of the total tumor cells in this model system. The mathematical modeling techniques
implemented here may be useful in other tumor models where direct observation of cell-cycle kinetics is
difﬁcult and may help evaluate tumor cell subpopulations with distinct cell-cycling rates. Cancer Res; 73(12);

Major Findings
Mathematical modeling of label-retention data from a mouse
model of lung cancer provides quantitative evidence for the
presence of two populations of tumor cells with distinct cell-cycling
kinetics.

Introduction
Normal adult stem cells are thought to be relatively
quiescent, a property that protects them from proliferative
exhaustion (2). Because of this property, "label-retention"
studies have been used to identify and characterize tissue-

speciﬁc stem cells for decades, following the pioneering work by
Potten and colleagues in the intestine (3). The existence of labelretaining cells has been proposed to be important for radiation
response (3, 4). Label-retention approaches have also been used
to identify stem cells in the interfollicular epidermis (5–9) and
the hematopoietic system (10–12). In the hematopoietic stem
cell (HSC) compartment, some studies have suggested the
existence of a slowly cycling stem cell population (9, 10, 12),
whereas other investigators have not found label retention in
this compartment (11). In cancer research, increasing attention
has focused on the heterogeneity of tumor cells present within
the tumor mass (distinct from the heterogeneity of nontumor
cells due to the presence of a tumor microenvironment) due to
the hypothesis that certain subpopulations of tumor cells have
increased capacity to propagate. These "cancer stem cells"
(CSC) or "tumor-initiating cells (TIC) share with normal stem
cells the ability to self-renew and "differentiate" into committed
cell types with more limited proliferative capacity (13). Cancer
stem cell populations have been identiﬁed and extensively
characterized in several solid tumors (14–17). However, it is
not clear whether these CSC populations share the property of
"label retention" that has been ascribed to some normal stem
cells. Recent data in glioblastoma and in skin cancer suggest
that indeed such slowly cycling CSCs may exist (18, 19).
However, whether this is true for other tumor types remains
to be determined. A limitation to carrying out a rigorous
analysis of the cell-cycle kinetics of solid tumor populations
is the lack of robust and rigorous quantitative methods.

Quick Guide to Equations and Assumptions
Equations
The two mathematical models compared in the analysis of the chase data are the following:
1. Exponential model (1-compartment model):
W ¼ lnðAeat Þ þ "

ðAÞ

Where W is the natural logarithm of the percentage of BrdUrdþ cells within a tumor, and "  Nð0; sÞ.
2. Biexponential model (2-compartment model)
W ¼ lnðAeat þ Bebt Þ þ "

ðBÞ

Where W is the natural logarithm of the percentage of BrdUrdþ cells within a tumor and "  Nð0; sÞ.
The ﬁrst equation uses an exponential decay function to model the percentage of tumor cells that are BrdUrdþ. The
parameters A and a are non–negative constants, and e is an error term from a normal distribution with mean zero and SD s. The
second equation models the same data as a biexponential decay function. The parameters A, a, B, and b are non-negative
constants, and e is an error term from a normal distribution with mean zero and SD s.
Parameter descriptions and interpretation
The parameter t denotes the time elapsed from time zero (after all BrdUrd administration ended) during chase phase.
The parameters a and b model how fast the cycling cells lose BrdUrd labeling.
The parameters A and B give the initial percentage of BrdUrdþ cells for each population.
The parameter ratio A/B gives the relative ratio of fast- and slow-cycling population in tumors.

Major Assumptions of the Model
1) Proliferation rates are proportional to the number of cells present;
2) Each tumor cell has a cross-sectional area of approximately 121 mm2 (measurements of cell counts and areas of a random
sample of 10 tumors gave a median value of 121 mm2, with a SD of 25 mm2; Supplementary Table S1);
3) Cell death rates are negligible for the time period of the experiment (we previously conﬁrmed that cell death rates as
determined by caspase-3 staining are indeed quite low (<1%) in this setting) (ref. 1; also Supplementary Fig. S1,
Supplementary Table S2);
4) The variance of the residuals of the log-transformed data is approximately constant;
5) Proportional error structures best characterize the residual errors for both models (based on tests of proportional and
additive error structures);
6) During BrdUrd pulse, every cell that undergoes cell division takes in enough BrdUrd to be detectable after only one cell
division;
7) The incorporation of BrdUrd has negligible effect on the survival of cells and their rate of cycling;
8) All cells require the same number of cell divisions to reach undetectable label levels (which can actually undercount cells
that slowly cycle);
9) The rate of loss of BrdUrd label is proportional to the rate of proliferation of labeled cells;
10) All cells in the region labeled as tumor are actual tumor cells;
11) Tumors at the same time point but from different mice are comparable in age and size distributions;
12) Tumor measurements at the same time point are independent from one sample to another whether from the same mouse
or from different mice;
13) Selection of tumor slices to sample is random; and
14) Tumor growth favors cells that cycle quickly over cells that cycle more slowly, in that any cells that cycle more slowly will
become a smaller proportion of the total number of cells over time (for this analysis, the implication is that any
population of slowly cycling cells that is detected at later time points was likely a larger proportion of all cells at earlier
time points).

CSCs in solid tumors are traditionally identiﬁed by differential cell sorting with speciﬁc cell surface markers (20). The
operational "stemness" property is deﬁned as an increased
ability to transplant tumors into an immunocompromised
host. However, this deﬁnition of CSCs remains controversial,

3526

as transplantation success rates can vary widely depending on
a wide range of technical factors (21). In human lung cancer,
several reports have suggested that a CSC population can be
enriched using cell surface markers, yet the cell-cycle kinetics
of these subpopulations (or indeed, whether slowly cycling

Mathematical Modeling of Tumor Cell Proliferation Kinetics

cells are synonymous with cancer stem cells deﬁned by transplantation assays) has not been explored (22, 23).
The KrasG12D/þ mouse model has been well validated for the
study of lung cancer initiation and progression in vivo (24).
Previous work has shown that this model closely recapitulates
the molecular changes seen in human non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC; ref. 25). In this model, an oncogenic Kras allele
is expressed only after delivery of Cre recombinase. Cre
recombinase is delivered via nasal instillation using an adenoviral vector (AdCre). Thus, timing of tumor initiation can be
well controlled. After Cre delivery, the lung epithelium begins
to proliferate and over time the lung parenchyma is occupied
by multiple adenomas, some of which then progress to adenocarcinoma. In the studies described here, BrdUrd incorporation was measured in tumors within the lungs in this
KrasG12D/þ model. Previous work using this model identiﬁed
a population of CD45PECAMSca1þ cells enriched for double-positive SPC/CC10 cells [bronchioalveolar stem cells
(BASC)] that are activated after lung injury and thus thought
to be CSCs (26). However, this population was not enriched for
transplantation ability into immunocompromised mice in the
KrasG12D/þ model (27). The fact that only a small percentage of
cells in the KrasG12D/þ model can transplant tumors suggests
that there is a subpopulation of cells with CSC characteristics.
"Label retention" of slowly cycling cells provides an alternative method for ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting of surface
markers to identify populations of cells within tumors with
important biological properties that may bypass the limitations of the transplantation approach. An advantage of labelretention studies is that they allow for rigorous testing of the
hypothesis that a slowly cycling population exists without the
need for complex crosses with lineage-tracing reporters and
other genetic tools (18, 19, 28). A priori, it cannot be assumed
that CSCs are label retaining. However, if a label-retaining
population can be identiﬁed by label-retention studies, this
could justify further experimentation to allow for isolation of
these cells. In addition, it may be important in some settings to
determine whether the CSC population is synonymous with
the slowly cycling population or whether these are overlapping
but distinct entities. Recent data isolating and characterizing a
label-retaining population in breast tissue supports this
approach (29).
A commonly used method to identify label-retaining cells is to
mark proliferating cells using the thymidine analogue 5-bromo2-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd). After administration of BrdUrd ends,
cycling cells will lose this DNA label as it will be diluted by half
of each complete cell cycle. Therefore, both BrdUrd uptake
("pulse") and BrdUrd dilution ("chase") data are useful in quantifying cell turnover rates. A key element of such an approach is
to develop appropriate statistical and mathematical modeling
techniques to show the presence of "label-retaining" cells. Mathematical modeling of BrdUrd label incorporation and retention
can quantify the behavior of the labeled cells and enable
identiﬁcation of populations with different cell-cycle kinetics.
Rigorous mathematical approaches have been developed that
use BrdUrd label retention to determine cell-cycle kinetics in
other settings. For example, Bonhoeffer and colleagues used a
mathematical model of BrdUrd incorporation to describe the

www.aacrjournals.org

kinetics of CD4þ and CD8þ lymphocytes circulating in uninfected and simian immunodeﬁciency virus–infected macaques
(30). The model was used to estimate proliferation and death
rates of these speciﬁc lymphocyte subsets. Similarly, Kiel and
colleagues modeled BrdUrd incorporation and retention data
from mice to test the "immortal strand" hypothesis of asymmetric chromosome segregation during division of HSCs and
concluded that asymmetric segregation of chromosomes does
not occur in the division of HSCs (11). Here, we use mathematical and statistical analysis of in vivo BrdUrd labeling data to
determine whether tumors in a mouse model of lung cancer
contain a population of slowly cycling tumor cells. Our results
strongly suggest that a population of slowly cycling tumor cells
does exist in the KrasG12D/þ model. These studies establish the
necessary justiﬁcation for further analysis of this slowly cycling
population in this model. More generally, we propose that the
mathematical analysis of BrdUrd labeling in tumor models
applied here may be broadly useful for other similar tumor
models to elucidate the heterogeneity of tumor cell kinetics.

Materials and Methods
Mice
For all studies, the KrasG12D/þ mouse model was used. Mice
were genotyped as previously described (24). AdCre was delivered by intranasal instillation between 4 and 6 weeks of age.
Mice were then allowed to age for 12 weeks before BrdUrd
administration. All animal experiments were approved by the
Stanford University School of Medicine Administrative Panel
on Laboratory Animal Care (APLAC; Stanford University,
Stanford, CA).
BrdUrd labeling
BrdUrd (Sigma-Aldrich) was administered to the mice for up
to 15 days for the pulse experiment and 7 days for the chase
experiment. Administration was done simultaneously both
through drinking water (1 mg/mL) and daily intraperitoneal
injections (100 mg per kilogram body weight) to maximize
delivery.
Immunohistochemistry and immunoﬂuorescence
After sacriﬁce, mouse lungs were removed, ﬁxed with Z-ﬁx
(Anatech Inc), and embedded in parafﬁn. Immunohistochemical or immunoﬂuorescence staining was conducted on 4-mm
sections. For primary antibodies, anti-BrdUrd (BD Pharmigen
clone 3d4, 1:200 dilution), anti-TTF1 (Abcam, 1:200 dilution),
anti-E-cadherin (BD Transduction Laboratories, clone 36,
1:200 dilution), and anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling,
1:300 dilution) were used. Detection was conducted with goat
anti-rat Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen), donkey anti-mouse Alexa
Fluor 488 (Invitrogen), and donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488
(Invitrogen) for immunoﬂuorescence, or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and ABC goat-anti-rabbit kit
for immunohistochemistry.
Quantiﬁcation of immunohistochemistry
The area of each tumor cross-section was measured using
Bioquant software, and the number of BrdUrd-positive
(BrdUrdþ) cells within each tumor was assessed by manual

Results
Determination of minimal sufﬁcient length of labeling
phase
To determine how long the BrdUrd labeling period should be
for the chase experiment, an extended pulse experiment was
conducted. KrasG12D/þ mice were treated with AdCre to initiate
expression of oncogenic Kras. Twelve weeks after introduction
of AdCre, when tumors were well established, mice were given
BrdUrd to label proliferating tumor cells. To determine the
minimal sufﬁcient length of the labeling phase, an initial
"pulse" of BrdUrd was delivered to mice for up to 15 days (see
Materials and Methods). Mice were sacriﬁced on days 2, 3, 5, 7,
9, 11, 13, and 15 during the labeling period and BrdUrd label
incorporation was assessed by immunohistochemistry using
an anti-BrdUrd antibody in parafﬁn-ﬁxed sections of lung. As
shown in Fig. 1, the cell population was effectively fully labeled
by day 7 (chase time "0 week"), with a median day 7 level of
29.4%. Therefore, for the chase data collection, a pulse phase of
7 days was used for the labeling of the mice.

Mathematical modeling
At the end of the 12 weeks of the chase, labeled cells were
still detected. This suggested the possibility of a labelretaining subpopulation with a slower cycling time than
other cells. To test this hypothesis, we ﬁt 2 mathematical
models to the chase data and compared the goodness-of-ﬁt
of the models. The ﬁrst was an exponential decay model,
which assumes that there is a single cell-cycling rate. The
second was a biexponential decay model, which assumes
that there are 2 distinct cell-cycling rates. Each model
included an error structure that was selected to give the
best ﬁt for that particular model to account for residual
variability. Different error structures were tested on each
model, and a 2-sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was conducted to conﬁrm that a proportional error structure
resulted in residuals that were indistinguishable from a
normal distribution for each of the models.
Because of the random selection of the slices and tumors for
analysis (described above), we assume that the %BrdUrd values
from a single mouse form a random sample. This is also
supported by Supplementary Fig. S2, which shows chase data
plotted by mouse. Supplementary Fig. S2 also provides graphical evidence that at each time point, the distributions of the
%BrdUrdþ values are similar between mice. In addition, the
Kruskal–Wallis test, an analogue of the ANOVA test for non–
normally distributed data, was conducted to compare the
median %BrdUrdþ values for all of the mice at a given time
point. With a signiﬁcance level of 0.05, 5 of the 9 time points
showed no signiﬁcant difference between those median values.
For the remaining 4 time points, there was at least one mouse
whose median differed from those of the other mice (although
only one of those time points would have shown a difference at
a signiﬁcance level of 0.01). To further investigate possible
differences between mice, we used the Wilcoxon rank sum test,
a nonparametric analogue of the t test, to compare the median
%BrdUrdþ values for each pair of mice at a time point. A
Bonferroni correction was used to account for the multiple
pairwise tests conducted at each time point. For 118 of the 119
possible comparisons, the median values for mice at a given
time point were not pairwise different at a signiﬁcance level of
0.05 (for the other comparison, the P value was 0.045). On the
basis of all of these results, we assume that all %BrdUrdþ values
at a given time point form a random sample.

Goodness-of-ﬁt testing
Both mathematical models were ﬁt to the data using
nonlinear regression. In both cases, a natural logarithm transformation of the data was used to account for the heteroscedasticity (nonuniform variance) of the data. Additive and
proportional error structures were then tested on the models.
For both models, proportional error structures gave the best
ﬁt and were used throughout the analysis. Goodness-of-ﬁt
comparisons of the 2 models were made using mean square
error (MSE) and Akaike information criterion (AIC) values.

counting. The number of BrdUrdþ cells per tumor crosssectional area was recorded. A manual count of 10 randomly
selected tumors gave an estimate of 121 mm2 area per tumor
cell (SD 24.9 mm2). This estimate was used to convert BrdUrdþ
cells per area into units of BrdUrdþ cells per total tumor cells.
Two mice at each time point were used to generate the pulse
data. At each time point in the chase period, approximately 5 or
6 mice were selected at random (one time point had 7 mice, and
another had 3). For each selected mouse, multiple slices of the
tumor-bearing lung were obtained and placed at random
positions on slides. Approximately 5 tumors were selected
randomly from the available slices for each mouse for analysis
(1 mouse with 1 tumor, 1 mouse with 2 tumors, 9 mice with 4
tumors, and 39 mice with 5 tumors).

tumor initiation (n ¼ 50). After 7 days of BrdUrd "pulse," mice
were sacriﬁced at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 (Fig. 2).
Four to 6 mice from this cohort were sacriﬁced at each
speciﬁed time, and the remaining number of BrdUrdþ cells
was determined again by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2A).
To conﬁrm that BrdUrd label-retaining cells, and particularly those present at the end of the chase experiment, were
indeed lung tumor cells and not cells from the surrounding
stroma, we used double labeling with immunoﬂuorescence
with an anti-BrdUrd antibody and an antibody against lung
epithelial marker E-cadherin or TTF-1 (Fig. 2B). The results
show that the vast majority of BrdUrdþ cells are indeed of
epithelial origin and therefore are likely to be lung tumor
cells.
Mathematical modeling supports the existence of a
distinct, slow-cycling population
At the end of the 12 weeks of the chase, labeled tumor
cells were still detected (Fig. 2A, 12 weeks; and Fig. 2B). This

suggested the possibility of a label-retaining tumor cell
subpopulation with a slower cycling time than that of other
tumor cells. To test this hypothesis, we ﬁt 2 mathematical
models to the chase data and compared the goodness-of-ﬁt
of the models (Fig. 2C and Table 1). The ﬁrst was an
exponential decay model, which assumes that there is a
single cell-cycling rate (Eq. A). The second was a biexponential decay model, which assumes that there are 2
distinct cell-cycling rates (Eq. B). Each model included an
error structure (as described in Materials and Methods)
that was selected to give the best ﬁt for that particular
model to account for residual variability. Different error
structures were tested on each model, and a 2-sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was conducted to conﬁrm that a
proportional error structure resulted in residuals that were
indistinguishable from a normal distribution for each of the
models.
We considered a few reﬁnements for these 2 models but
ﬁnally used the simple models described above:

NOTE: Percent relative standard error (%RSE) for each parameter estimate is included in parentheses on the left. Measures of
"goodness-of-ﬁt" on the right are derived from either MSE or AIC method.

1) One reﬁnement considered was allowing cells to take
differing numbers of cell divisions to reach an
undetectable level of label. Kiel and colleagues (11)
estimated that approximately 3 rounds of cell division are
needed to decrease the level of BrdUrd present in a cell
below the threshold of detection after full labeling.
Bonhoeffer and colleagues (30) estimated that the number
of cell divisions needed to have the BrdUrd level drop
below the lower limit of detection to be 5 to 6 divisions. We
assumed that all cells require the same number of
divisions during the chase phase to reach an undetectable
level of label, which allowed us to use the simple models.
This is a reasonable assumption if all cells begin the chase
phase with equally high levels of label. However, if there are
slower cycling cells, they could begin the chase phase with
lower levels of label than other cells owing to fewer cell
divisions during the labeling period. Because BrdUrd is
taken up into DNA during the S-phase of cell division, the
number of times a cell divides during the BrdUrd pulse
phase affects the amount of BrdUrd incorporated at the
end of the pulse phase. Cells that divide more rapidly can
take up more label per time period than cells that divide
more slowly (31). If the label period is not sufﬁciently long,
slower-cycling cells may require fewer divisions for the
label to become undetectable. This could lead to an
undercounting of slower-cycling cells at later times during
the chase phase, if such cells exist.
2) In contrast with the situation in normal tissues, the size
of the compartment for solid tumors changes over time.
To account for this, we normalized counts of BrdUrdþ
cells by an area-based estimate of the total number of
cells in each tumor sample. We did not include cell death
in our mathematical models because tumors in the
KrasG12D/þ model are highly proliferative and yet show
very few apoptotic cells. Cell death rates as determined by
caspase-3 staining are indeed quite low (<1%) in this
setting (1). Therefore cell death was not included in the
mathematical models.
3) We also ﬁt exponential and biexponential models to the
pulse data and compared the goodness-of-ﬁt of the
models. However, the data were insufﬁcient to be able to
distinguish one model as signiﬁcantly better than the
other. Therefore we did not include a model for the pulse
data in our results.
MSE and AIC were used to compare the models. Both MSE
and AIC are measures of goodness-of-ﬁt, with a smaller value

3530

Cancer Res; 73(12) June 15, 2013

indicating a better ﬁt. However, AIC penalizes for extra parameters, taking into account that a model with more parameters has more degrees of freedom and will give a better ﬁt to
data for this reason.
As shown in Table 1, the MSE values were 0.476 and 0.456 for
the exponential and biexponential models, respectively. The
AIC values were 496.46 and 490.25 for the exponential and
biexponential models, respectively. Therefore the mathematical model that assumed 2 distinct cycling periods gave a
measurably superior ﬁt to the data than the model with a
single cycling period using either criterion. Both models incorporated variability, as described in Materials and Methods,
so the difference was not simply due to random variability
favoring a model with multiple cycling periods. In addition, a
Lowess ﬁt was made for the residuals with a proportional error
structure for each model, and visual comparison conﬁrmed
that the residuals for the biexponential model were more
uniformly distributed than the residuals for the exponential
model (Fig. 3A and B).
Cross-validation supports that the 2-compartment
model is a superior model
To further verify that the biexponential model was indeed a
better ﬁt to the data, a number of cross-validation tests were
conducted. The cross-validations give a measure of the sensitivity of the models to the data by testing whether the models
overﬁt the data. For each cross-validation, a subset of data (the
validation data) was removed from the full data set. The
remaining data (the training data) were ﬁt with the 2 models
described in the Quick Guide to Equations and Assumptions.
The structure of the training data sets for the various crossvalidations is described below.

was formed by removing all data taken from a single mouse.
This procedure was repeated so that each mouse was left out
once, for a total of 50 cases. The ﬁtting algorithm for the
biexponential model did not converge in one of these cases, so
there were only 49 cases in which the 2 models could be
compared.
Cross-validation 2 (omit 1 mouse per time point). A
training set of data was formed by removing all data from
one mouse at each time point. This was done 1,000 times, with
a random selection of the mice.
Cross-validation 3 (omit 1 tumor per mouse). Each
training set of data was formed by randomly removing all of
the data from one tumor from each mouse. This was done 1,000
times.

The red curve is a Lowess ﬁt.

Cross-validation 4 (omit 2 tumors per mouse). Training
sets were formed by removing 2 samples at random from the
data from each mouse. This was done 1,000 times.
Cross-validation 5 (omit 20% of data per time point).
Training sets were formed by removing approximately 20% of
the samples at each time point at random. This was done 1,000
times.
The MSE and the AIC were computed for each of the models
when they were ﬁt to a training data set. The percentages of
times the biexponential model gave a superior ﬁt (as measured
by lower MSE or AIC) are recorded in Table 2. For all 5 types of
cross-validations conducted, the biexponential model gave a
better ﬁt than the exponential model as determined by both
MSE and AIC. The MSE was lower for the biexponential model
in 100% of cases. The AIC was lower for the biexponential model
in more than 75% of cases for each of the 5 cross-validations.
For each of the ﬁtted models derived from the training data,
the MSE was computed for the validation data. The percentages of cases in which the MSE value was better (lower) for the
biexponential function than the exponential function are
recorded in Table 2. In each of the cross-validation methods
conducted, the biexponential model had lower MSE values
than the exponential model for the majority of cases (more

Predictive checks supported selection of the
biexponential model
As further model validation, 2 predictive checks were conducted for the models. The best-ﬁtting exponential and biexponential models to the full data set were used to produce
simulated data.
Predictive check 1. The same number of data points at each
time point as contained in the original data set were simulated for
each time point, and this was done 1,000 times to give 1,000 full
datasets of simulated data for each of the 2 models.
Predictive check 2. A total of 500 data points were simulated at each time point. This was repeated 1,000 times to give
1,000 simulated data sets (each with 500 data points at each
time) for each of the 2 models.
For each predictive check, the distributions of the simulated and real data at each time point were compared. The 2sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was applied to determine
statistical signiﬁcance for differences between the distributions, with the null hypothesis being that any 2 distributions
being compared cannot be distinguished (with a signiﬁcance
level of 0.05). Table 3 summarizes the results of the tests,
with the entries giving the percentages of cases (out of 1,000
simulations) in which the null hypothesis was rejected and

We conducted mathematical modeling and statistical analyses of BrdUrd label-retention data in tumors using a mouse
model of human lung cancer. In every test conducted, a model
with 2 distinct cycling rates was found to ﬁt the data better
than a model with a single cycling rate. Multiple methods of
cross-validation and predictive checks conﬁrmed this conclusion. Residuals for both models were ﬁt by Lowess curves (Fig.
3A and B), visually showing a more uniform distribution of
residuals for the biexponential model. The modeling and
analysis provide quantitative evidence for the existence of a
label-retaining population of cells and thus indicate that there
are likely 2 distinct proliferation rates in this solid tumor

Mathematical modeling was applied to BrdUrd-labeled
tumor cells in a mouse model of lung cancer. Measures of
goodness-of-ﬁt for the competing mathematical models
showed that 2 distinct proliferation rates are more likely than
a single proliferation rate, providing quantitative evidence of a
population of "label-retaining" tumor cells. The mathematical
modeling also allowed us to estimate the proliferation rate of
this label-retaining population as well as to estimate the
proliferation rate of the faster-cycling, non–label-retaining

Discussion

Conclusions

Predicted % of slow-cycling cells

Predicted values
The parameter estimates for the 2-compartment model
in Table 1 indicate that approximately 31% of the cells were
initially in the slow population and that the mean turnover
rates for the fast and slow populations were 1.8 and 5.7
weeks per cell, respectively. Figure 4 shows the biexponential
function prediction of the slowly cycling population over the
course of the chase experiment. It was created by ﬁrst
bootstrapping the data sets to create 1,000 new datasets
and ﬁtting each data set to get a new set of parameter
estimates. Those 1,000 sets of parameter estimates were
then used to calculate the fraction of slowly cycling cells at
each experimental time point. The 2.5, 50, and 97.5 percentiles of those values were plotted.

whether these label-retaining cells are indeed tumor-initiating

the 2 distributions being compared were distinguishable
according to the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. In addition to
the comparisons of simulated and real data, comparisons
were made between simulated data sets for the 2 different
models. Those results are included in the tables as well. In
both predictive checks, for the majority of the points, the
biexponential model was indistinguishable from the data
more often than the exponential model was. This was true
for 6 of 9 time points in the ﬁrst test (Table 3, top) and 8 of 9
time points in the second test (Table 3, bottom).

determination of the fraction of tumor cells that are label
retaining at various times during the chase phase. This provides an upper bound on the fraction of tumor cells in the
samples that may have stem cell–like properties and an
estimate of their proliferation rate. The parameter estimates
for the 2-compartment model in Table 1 indicate that approximately 31% of the cells were initially in the slow population
and that the mean turnover rates for the fast and slow
populations were 1.8 and 5.7 weeks per cell, respectively.
