Abstract
The aim of this study was to discover a small molecule activator BL-AD008
targeting AMPK/ZIPK and inducing apoptosis in cervical cancer. In this study, we
systematically constructed the global protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and
predicted apoptosis-related protein connections by the Naïve Bayesian model. Then,
we identified some classical apoptotic PPIs and other previously unrecognized PPIs
between apoptotic kinases, such as AMPK and ZIPK. Subsequently, we screened a
series of candidate compounds targeting AMPK/ZIPK, synthesized some compounds
and eventually discovered a novel dual-target activator (BL-AD008). Moreover, we
found BL-AD008 bear remarkable anti-proliferative activities toward cervical cancer
cells and could induce apoptosis by death-receptor and mitochondrial pathways.
Additionally, we found that BL-AD008-induced apoptosis was affected by the
combination of AMPK and ZIPK. Then, we found that BL-AD008 bear its anti-tumor
activities and induced apoptosis by targeting AMPK/ZIPK in vivo. In conclusion, these
results demonstrate the ability of systems biology network to identify some key
apoptotic kinase targets AMPK and ZIPK; thus providing a dual-target small molecule
activator (BL-AD008) as a potential new apoptosis-modulating drug in future cervical
cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

to mediate cell death by activating core apoptotic
pathways, as well as to remodel the structure of apoptotic
network [5]. Therefore, a comprehensive knowledge of
protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks may provide
a basic framework for better understanding of apoptosis
as an integrated system [6, 7]. With increasing genomewide data of genetic, functional and physical interactions,
a robust mathematical model which is well-suited for
integrating disparate types of data, seems to be imperative
for inferring the apoptotic process [8]. Moreover,

Apoptosis is a complex but highly defined cellular
program of demolition with numerous links to many
pathological processes, such as cancer [1, 2]. Complexity
of apoptosis may inspire systems biology approaches
to uncover its inner mechanisms by some mathematical
models, such as ordinary differential equations, Petri nets,
Bayesian networks, and Boolean model [3, 4]. Hitherto,
new emerging therapeutic strategies have been considered

biological process (SSBP) (Figure 1D), respectively.
Subsequently, we used LR cutoff as 117 and achieved the
global PPI network with 12,809 binary PPIs by combining
the prediction set and the positive set (Figure 1E). Using
the lunched Naïve Bayesian model, we found that STS
containing 12,809 interacting protein pairs conformed
by 4,818 unique proteins was input the network model,
resulting the area under ROC curve (Figure 1F). As
a result, we got the global PPI network, and further
modified this network into the apoptotic PPI network
(Figure 2A). We identified hub proteins implicated in
core apoptotic pathways according to the four golden
standards (the degree of each protein, the link number
of apoptotic protein, network topology, and significance
analysis of microarrays analysis). Thus, combination of
the four standards that can be integrated into a well-suited
approach to decrease the false-positive PPIs on some
level; thereby, confirming apoptotic hub proteins (Figure
S1).

inactivation of pro-apoptotic proteins or up-regulation of
anti-apoptotic proteins may result in unchecked growth of
cells and thus ultimately leading to carcinogenesis [9-11].
Carcinogenesis is a multi-step process caused by
genetic alterations involving mutations of some oncogenes
or other tumor suppressors that may drive the progressive
transformation of normal cells into malignant ones [12].
At systems level, genetic mutations may alter translated
proteins and thus disrupting downstream signaling
pathways and even the PPI network; ultimately resulting
in resistance to apoptosis [13]. Recently, protein kinases
has been reported to orchestrate the activation of signaling
cascades in response to extracellular and intracellular
stimuli to control cell growth, proliferation, survival and
apoptosis [14, 15]. Hitherto, cancer drug discovery has
significantly benefited from a rapid progress for further
understanding how to target the key protein kinases
with small molecule compounds in cancer therapy [16].
However, complexity of the apoptotic kinase network
may inspire more systems biology approaches to uncover
novel kinase targets for cancer drug design [16]. Thus,
these findings would provide a key clue for the discovery
of novel anti-tumor candidate drugs targeting some key
apoptotic kinases.
In this study, we demonstrated the ability of systems
biology network to identify some key apoptotic kinase
targets, such as AMPK and ZIPK in cervical cancer, and
thus provided a small molecule activator (BL-AD008) as
a new potential anti-tumor drug in cervical cancer therapy.

Identification of two key apoptotic kinase targets
AMPK and ZIPK
Then, we identified a few of apoptotic hub proteins
and their relevant signaling pathways that could be further
integrated into the predicted core apoptotic network
which composed of 109 proteins (3,767 protein pairs)
(Figure 2B) (Table S2). From the core apoptotic network,
we identified not only classical hub proteins such as
caspases (CASP1/2/3/8), DR family (FAS, TNFR1 and
NGFR), Bcl-2 family (BAK, BCL2 and BCL2L1) and
p53 family, but other previously seldom recognized/
unrecognized apoptotic proteins, such as AMPK, DAPK3
(ZIPK), CDK7, MAPK11, β-ARK, MAPK3, RASK, and
RFXK (The unrecognized standards were confirmed by
the consensus results from GO annotation and PubMed
search). Thus, the core apoptotic network involved in
classical and novel hub proteins may provide not only
a high-priority list of the key apoptotic regulators, but
potential new drug targets (Figure 2B). Next, we identified
several classical hub proteins such as caspases, DRs, Bcl-2
family and p53 family that have been well-characterized
to play their pivotal roles in apoptosis. According to
different subcellular localizations, we could divide them
into secreted, nucleus, cytoplasm, multiple and unknown
localizations (Figure 2B). In addition, we found that these
classical hub proteins could interact with some previously
unrecognized (other) hubs in the context of apoptosis
(Figure 2C).
Besides the novel interactions among classical
proteins, we focused on exploring the interactions between
classical and other hub proteins (other hub proteins were
defined by themselves with unexpectedly high levels of
connectivity to apoptotic proteins) (Figure 2D). Based on
757 apoptotic hub proteins, we demonstrated that AMPK

RESULTS
Construction of core apoptotic kinase network
Based upon some online databases, we
computationally constructed the global PPI network. To
construct the set of true-positive gene pairs, we manually
derived physical PPIs. A total number of 85,083 unique
PPIs among 13,128 proteins were prepared as data sources
for our Golden Standard Positive (GSP) set. We generated
a Golden Standard Negative (GSN) set that could be
defined as all the possible pair-wise combinations, in
which one protein is assigned to the plasma membrane
and the other to the nucleus according to GO cellular
component annotation, resulting in 23,169,177 pairs in our
GSN (Table S1). Moreover, we integrated four different
types of biological datasets and chose the likelihood
ratio (LR) =117 as the reliability of individual dataset for
inferring the apoptotic PPIs. Each dataset could be divided
into several bins due to their intrinsic characters, and LR
for each bin was calculated, indicating the corresponding
results of cross-species interolog mapping (Figure 1A),
gene co-expression profiles (Figure 1B), domain-domain
interaction (DDI) (Figure 1C) and smallest shared

(the top one with the number of links to other hub proteins)
could interact with 87 hub proteins and ZIPK (the top two
with the number of links to other hub ones) could interact
with 76 (see in Table S3 and Table S4). Interestingly, they
could regulate the common 67 hub proteins (occupying
about 72.04% of all the hub proteins they interact with) in
the apoptotic kinase subnetwork (occupying about 12.29%
of all hub proteins in the apoptotic kinase network),
suggesting AMPK and ZIPK may be regarded as the
common double targets in cancer.

structures. Then, we screened the structure-based candidate
small molecules that could target AMPK and ZIPK based
on the FDA-approved and ongoing experimental drugs
from Drugbank and ZINC, respectively. Subsequently,
we achieved the top ten small molecule compounds from
Drugbank and ZINC that could bind their target AMPK
stably (Figure S2). In addition, we achieved the top ten
small molecule compounds from Drugbank and ZINC that
could also bind their target ZIPK stably (Figure S3). Thus,
we used the top ten compounds from Drugbank and ZINC
for further analyses. Then, we obtained 10 compounds by
the commercial purchase or chemical synthesis named
A1-A10. Then, the MTT assay was carried out in the
context of HeLa and C4-I cells. Amongst all the candidate
small molecules, compound A1 bear remarkable antiproliferative activity toward these two types of cervical
cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner.

Modeling, docking and anti-proliferative activities
of candidate compounds targeting AMPK/ZIPK
We firstly constructed the molecular modeling
of AMPK and ZIPK based upon their crystallographic

activator (BL-AD008)

(Figure 3). The synthesis process of candidate compounds
(AD001-BL-AD008) was described (see in Table S5).
Substituted indolones could react with chloracetyl
chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride, substituted
indolones could react with chloracetyl chloride to produce
Friedel–Crafts reaction product 5-(2-chloroacetyl)
indolinones. And, the yielding product was condensed with
sodium borohydride and trifluoroacetic acid to give the
reduced products 5-(2-chloroethyl) indolinones in a total

Through comparing the two receptor affinity,
we found that the C3-position of indole ring needed
more hydrophobic interaction. Therefore, the structural
modification was mainly focused on the C-3 position
of indole ring using bioisostere replacement strategy

In refluxing, dioxane gave the adduct, which was finally
purified by silica-gel column chromatography using
hexane and ethyl acetate as an eluent to obtain the
final products AD001-AD005 (yield: 45-57%) (Figure
S4, Scheme 1). The syntheses of AD006-BL-AD008
were similar to the aforementioned steps with different
starting materials (Figure S4, Scheme 2&3). The high
degree of symmetry in these molecules enabled facile
confirmation by NMR techniques. For example, in the

was clearly distinguishable from the resonances arising
from the carbon linkers at 2.64 (m) and 2.47 (m) ppm.

Molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD)
stimulations of BL-AD008 with AMPK/ZIPK
Molecular docking calculations were first performed
for BL-AD008 without explicit active site water molecules.
The ligand structures with the most favorable binding free
energies and reasonable orientations were selected as the
optimal docked conformations. 5ns MD simulations were

was mainly focused on C-3 position of indole ring using bioisostere replacement strategy. The synthesis process of candidate compounds

successfully performed on AMPK–BL-AD008 and ZIPKBL-AD008 complexes (Figure 4A). To gauge whether the
MD simulations were stable and whether they converged,
energetic and structural properties were monitored during
the course of MD simulation. The low root-mean-square
deviation (RMSD) fluctuations and the convergence of
the energies, temperatures, and pressures of the systems
observed indicated well-behaved systems. The RMSDs
between the complexes and ligand structures obtained
during the trajectories and the initial structures were
shown (Figure 4B). The averaged RMSD during the last 3
ns for AMPK–BL-AD008 and ZIPK-BL-AD008 are 0.18
and 0.16 nm, respectively, suggesting the overall stable
structures after approximately 3 ns simulation. In this
study, we showed that compound A1 could bind to AMPK

stably. The benzene ring of compound form interaction
with residue LYS-31, and also form hydrophobic
interaction with VAL-11, LEU-18, PHE-90 and ILE-46.
For compound BL-AD008, there are two hydrogen bonds
formed by residue ASN-48 and LYS-31., Cl atom of BLAD008 could form interaction with PHE-90.. BL-AD008
can form hydrophobic interaction with residue VAL-11,
LEU-18, PHE-90, ILE-46 and VAL-24. Thus, the binding
energy of BL-AD008 is much lower than A1 (Figure 4).
Moreover, we showed that compound A1could bind
to ZIPK stably. And, there are two hydrogen bonds formed.
The first one is N atom from compound A1 with carbonyl
group of residue GLU-94, the other one is carbonyl
group of compound A1 with N atom from main chain of
residue VAL-96. A1 also form significant hydrophobic

interaction with residue ILE-160, MET-146, VAL-27,
VAL-96, LEU-93 and LEU-19. These residues form a
hrdrophic pocket. BL-AD008, as the same as A1, two
hydrogen bonds also could be found from BL-AD008 with
carbonyl group of residue GLU-94 and carbonyl group of
compound BL-AD008 with N atom from main chain of
residue VAL-96. But comparing with A1, except form
the hydrophobic interaction with the hydrophobic pocket
formed by residue ILE-160, MET-146, VAL-27, VAL-96,
LEU-93 and LEU-19, benzene ring of BL-AD008 formed
additional more hydrophobic interaction with residue
LEU-93 and LEU-68 (Figure 4). Further insights into
the forces involved in substrate binding can be obtained
by analyzing the MM/GBSA free-energy contributions.
The binding free energies of two complex systems were
calculated by MMPBSA.py program in AMBER 12 at the
atomic level. A total of 300 snapshots were taken from
the last 3ns of MD simulations for analysis. We present
the predicted and experimental binding energies, together
with their respective entropic contributions (Table S6).
As displayed, the ranking of the predicted binding free
energies are in good agreement with the experimental data.
It should be noted that the binding free energies might not
reproduce the absolute experimental values accurately,
but they correlate with the experimental values well. The
order of the preferentially favorable binding free energy
contribution was AMPK > ZIPK, with the corresponding

ΔGbind values -40.12 and -34.18 kcal/mol, respectively. In
the two studied protein-ligand systems, the van der Waals
(
) contributions and the nonpolar solvation energies (
) are main form for favorable binding free energies.
The favorable Coulomb interactions within the systems
are counteracted by the unfavorable electrostatics of
de-solvation. The resulting balance of the electrostatic
interaction contributions in vacuum and solvent, namely
+
is unfavorable in binding for all the systems.

BL-AD008 induces apoptosis via the death
receptor and mitochondrial pathways in cervical
cancer cells
We found that BL-AD008 caused a remarkable antiproliferative effect on HeLa and C4-I cell growth in dosedependent manner, and the treatment with 600 nM BLAD008 for 24h resulted in almost 50% inhibition in the
HeLa cells (Figure 5A). To characterize the BL-AD008induced HeLa cell apoptosis, we observed the morphologic
changes in the cells. When the cells were cultured with
600nM BL-AD008 for 24 h, the apoptotic alterations were
also observed under the inverted microscopy. And, the
marked apoptotic morphologic alterations were observed
by Hoechst 33258 staining under fluorescence microscopy
(Figure 5B). In addition, apoptosis was further evaluated

by Annexin-V/PI double staining. BL-AD008 markedly
induced the increase of apoptotic ratio in HeLa cells
(Figure 5C).
To assess whether Fas-mediated pathway was
activated in BL-AD008-treated HeLa cells, the levels of
Fas, FasL, Fas-Associated protein with Death Domain
(FADD) and caspase-8 were determined by Western
blot analysis. The levels of Fas, FasL and FADD were
markedly elevated and then there was obvious increase in
the cleavage of caspase-8 after BL-AD008 administration
(Figure 6A). Therefore, death receptor pathway is involved
in BL-AD008-induced apoptosis. Next, we found that Bax
expression was increased whereas Bcl-2 expression was
decreased in HeLa cells. Moreover, we detected decrease
of mitochondrial membrane potential by Rhodamin 123
staining in BL-AD008-treated HeLa cells (Figure 6B).
It clearly indicates that BL-AD008-induced apoptosis
in HeLa cells is mediated by a mitochondrial pathway.
Then, we investigated the involvements of caspase-9 and
caspase-3 in BL-AD008-induced apoptosis. Caspase-9
activation was determined by measurement of the active
forms of caspase-9. The active form of caspase-3 was
observed during BL-AD008 treatment (Figure 6B). These
results suggest that mitochondrial pathway is also involved
in BL-AD008-induced apoptosis. Moreover, we showed

that the ratio of p-AMPK expression was increased in BLAD008-treared HeLa cell apoptosis, and the ratio of ZIPK
expression was also increased in this context. Thus, these
results suggest that BL-AD008-induced apoptosis can be
mainly affected by AMPK and ZIPK in HeLa cells (Figure
6C).

BL-AD008-induced apoptosis is mainly affected
by AMPK and ZIPK
To examine whether BL-AD008 is targeted AMPK/
ZIPK activator, we showed that AMPK expression was
remarkably decreased in BL-AD008+AMPK siRNAtreated HeLa cells compared with BL-AD008-indcued
HeLa cells. In addition, we examined the expressions of
caspase-8, caspase-9 and caspase-3 between BL-AD008treated and BL-AD008+AMPK siRNA-treated conditions.
Caspase-8, caspase-9 and caspase-3 expressions were
partially decreased in BL-AD008+AMPK siRNA-treated
than BL-AD008-treated HeLa cells. It suggests that
AMPK activation may have more effects on the activation
of caspase-8, caspase-9 and caspase-3 in BL-AD008induced apoptosis (Figure 7A).
Next, we showed that ZIPK was almost not

expressed in BL-AD008+ZIPK siRNA-treated HeLa
cells; whereas ZIPK was expressed in BL-AD008-indcued
context. Then, we examined the different expressions
of caspase-8, caspase-9 and caspase-3 between BLAD008-treated and BL-AD008+ZIPK siRNA-treated
conditions. Caspase-8 expression abruptly decreased in
BL-AD008+ZIPK siRNA-treated than BL-AD008-treated
HeLa cells. This result is similar with BL-AD008+AMPK
siRNA-treated HeLa cells (Figure 7B). Then, we found
that caspase-8, caspase-9 and caspase-3 could not be
expressed in BL-AD008+ZIPK siRNA + AMPK siRNAtreated HeLa cells; whereas they could express in BLAD008-indcued HeLa cells, suggesting that BL-AD008
may be a targeted AMPK/ZIPK activator (Figure 7C).

(Figure 8C).

BL-AD008 induces apoptosis in vivo
For better understanding of the mechanism of
the therapeutic efficacy of BL-AD008 in our in vivo
model, we examined the caspase-3, caspase-8, Bcl-2,
Bax, p-AMPKα and ZIPK expressions in tumor samples
immunoreactivity. Active form of caspase-3 and caspase-8
were observed in the tumor. And, Bcl-2 was inhibited
by BL-AD008 while Bax expression was increased
(Figure 9A). They were determined in tumor xenografts
as parameters for the apoptosis levels. Western blotting
assay further demonstrated that all their expression
in BL-AD008-treated tumor samples were consistent
with immunohistochemical results and caspase cascade
activating. And we also tested the p-AMPKα and ZIPK for
their regulation by BL-AD008. In addition, DNA repairing
protein PARP-1 were sheared significantly (Figure 9B).
The increase of the expression levels of p-AMPKα and
ZIPK confirmed the efficacy of BL-AD008 in tumor
tissues. Moreover, immunohistochemical and western
blotting results suggesting the apoptosis induced by BLAD008 in tumor tissues.

BL-AD008 displays a potent anti-tumor activity
in vivo
Based upon the anti-proliferative efficacy of BLAD008 on HeLa cells in vitro, we proceeded to assess
its efficacy on inhibiting tumor growth in an orthotopic
xenograft mouse model of cervical cancer. In this
experiment, we used three different doses of BL-AD008.
Compared with the control group, high dose of BL-AD008
can induce the significant body weight loss in nude mice.
As a result, high doses of BL-AD008 induced 15.6%
loss of mice weight during the 10 days of treatment.
The toxicity of low and median dose BL-AD008 were
not obvious (Figure 8A). At the end of the experiment,
the tumor weights decreased remarkably in median and
high dose groups (P<0.001). For more toxicity study, the
liver weights decrease of mice in high dose group were
measured (P<0.001). And spleen and kidney weights
also affected by high dose of BL-AD008 (P<0.01), no
other obvious toxicity was observed in low and median
dose groups. We obtained identical results by directly
measuring the tumor volumes. In all three BL-AD008
groups, the tumor volumes were much smaller than the
control group (Figure 8B). In according to the balance
between anti-tumor efficacy and toxicity, the median dose
was used as the optimum dose for treatment of tumor
growth. To test whether BL-AD008-mediated inhibition
of HeLa xenograft growth in vivo was associated with
reduced cell proliferation and/or increased apoptosis,
tumor tissues from control and BL-AD008-treated mice
were processed for immunohistochemical analysis of Ki67 expression and TUNEL staining. Immunoreactivity
for Ki-67, a marker of proliferation, was localized to the
cell nuclei. BL-AD008 treatment significantly reduced
the number of Ki-67-positive HeLa cells compared to the
control treatment. In addition, BL-AD008 administration
resulted in a statistically significant increase in number
of apoptotic bodies in the tumor as visualized by TUNEL
assay, suggesting that BL-AD008-induced tumor cell

DISCUSSION
Previous studies reported that the cancer-perturbed
PPI network was well-characterized by a nonlinear
stochastic model, maximum likelihood parameter
estimation, and akaike information criteria for the
discovery of novel apoptotic targets, based upon the gene
co-expression profiling [17]. Other reports demonstrated
that the central apoptotic pathways and their connections
were built by a large-scale literature-based Boolean
model, which may assume that the apoptotic pathways are
either present or absent (on/off) [18]. These mathematics
models can uncover some core pathways s in the apoptotic
process; however, the PPI network is actually complex,
non-linear and not simply composed of on/off connections
or depends on solely biological evidence. The PPI network
is typically complicated for its nature, with multiple
connections amongst numerous signaling pathways; thus,
it is necessary to represent this network by using the Naïve
Bayesian model that can integrate disparate data types
into an advantageous platform [19]. We developed Naïve
Bayesian model, which was well-suited to integrate these
high-throughput data such as SSBP, gene co-expression
profiles, DDI and cross-species interolog mapping for
predicting protein functional connections; thereby,
constructing the apoptotic PPI network. Moreover, we
used a multiple analysis method which could integrate
four golden standards such as degree, GO annotation,
network module and microarray analysis for identifying
our apoptotic hub proteins. Compared to previous studies

for the discovery of novel apoptotic targets based on sole
evidence [17, 18], we used our multiple analysis which
may include more biological characteristics and thus
being more accurate for apoptotic hub protein/target
identification.
Previous studies have demonstrated that a
mechanistic mathematical model can describe the
temporal evolution of caspase activation, indicating the
key elements of receptor-modulated caspase activation
[20, 21]. Another study has reported that prediction of
caspase cleavage sites can be carried out by Bayesian
bio-basis function neural networks [22]. In this study,
we computationally predicted that caspase-3 and -8 were
involved in the core apoptotic network, and subsequently
confirmed that caspase-8, -9 and -3 played their roles in
BL-AD008-treated HeLa cells. Apoptosis is triggered by
the extrinsic (death receptor) or intrinsic (mitochondrial)
pathway. Death receptor pathway can be initiated by
stimulations of members of DR family such as CD95/
Fas, TRAIL, and TNF [20]. Previous studies have shown
that a model can characterize apoptosis initiation at the
CD95 DISC, considering activation of procaspase-8

at the DISC and inhibition of procaspase-8 activation
by c-FLIP proteins. CD95 signaling defines a threshold
activation behavior, and the decisions to undergo apoptosis
depend on the ratio between procaspase-8 and c-FLIP
proteins [23]. Another model of the cross-talks between
CD95-mediated apoptotic and non-apoptotic signaling
have been reported that life/death decision is taken at
the DISC and defined by DED protein concentrations
and c-FLIP cleavage product generation [24]. Other
studies have demonstrated that death receptors play the
key roles in deciding the apoptotic network and adding
to signal processing capabilities attributed to receptor
clustering [25, 26]. Besides, caspases are linked to Bcl-2
family which is the key regulator of apoptosis and often
over-expresses in cancer [27, 28]. Therefore, we showed
the close relationships among caspases, DRs and Bcl2 family, indicating that the apoptotic PPI network is
high-dependable; thus, providing a basic framework of
apoptosis. Recently, a model of mitochondrial pathways
has been reported that apoptosome-dependent caspase
activation depends on the concentration of XIAP,
indicating the key roles of procaspase-9 and caspase-3, as

Figure 10: A schematic model of network prediction and experimental validation of a novel AMPK/ ZIPK activator
BL-AD008 in cervical cancer. (A) We systematically constructed the global protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and integrated
four different biological evidence to predict apoptosis-related protein connections by the Naïve Bayesian model; (B) Utilizing the Naïve
Bayesian model and four golden standards, we identified some key apoptotic kinase targets, such as AMPK and ZIPK in cancer; (C) We
screened many candidate compounds, synthesized some compounds and eventually designed a novel dual-target activator (BL-AD008) that
induced the death-receptor and mitochondrial apoptosis, which was affected by AMPK and ZIPK in cervical cancer in vitro and in vivo.

siRNA experiments, suggesting that apoptosis may be
main target for BL-AD008 in cervical cancer therapy.
In conclusion, we demonstrate the ability of our
Naïve Bayesian model-based network for identifying the
key double targets AMPK and ZIPK, and provide the dualtarget activator (BL-AD008) as a potential new apoptosismodulating drug for cervical cancer therapy (Figure 10).
Therefore, these findings would lead to a comprehensive
mechanistic insights into identification of more ideal dual
targets as well as discovery of more new kinase activators.
Moreover, it would also provide a basis for developing
more new systems biology network-based approaches and
more promising strategies for future cancer therapeutics.

well as of a positive feedback loop between caspase-3 and
caspase-9 [29]. In this study, we computationally predicted
some death receptors and Bcl-2 family members that were
both involved in the apoptotic subnetwork. Subsequently,
we experimentally validated that BL-AD008-induced
apoptosis was dependent on both death receptor and
mitochondrial pathways.
Interestingly, we identified not only the
aforementioned classical hub proteins such as caspases,
DR family and Bcl-2 family that can be implicated in core
apoptotic pathways, but some ‘novel’ hub proteins/targets,
such as AMPK and ZIPK in core apoptotic pathways.
Accordingly, we screened the above-mentioned hub
proteins that may provide a ranked list of high-priority,
new kinase targets. Previous study has reported that
targeting PI3KCI/Akt/mTOR signaling with inhibitors
such as ATP-competitive compounds can improve cancer
therapeutic effect because the catalytic sites of PI3KCI
and mTOR share a high degree of sequence homology
[30]. In addition, other report has demonstrated that the
dual PI3KCI/mTOR inhibitor PI-103 and the Mdm2
inhibitor Nutlin-3 is a combination strategy aimed at
inhibiting PI3KCI/Akt/mTOR signaling and activating
p53 signaling in AML [31]. Moreover, a recent report
has shown that ZD6474 can evaluate the feasibility and
efficacy of combined VEGFR2 and EGFR in breast cancer
cells, which may be an alternative approach to the ongoing
conventional cancer radiotherapy [32]. Distinctive from
these dual-target strategies, we decided to target both
AMPK and ZIPK by systems biology network prediction,
which provided the clue that the two kinase could interact
with many apoptotic kinases and thus play their crucial
roles in the apoptotic kinase subnetwork of cancer. It is
well-known that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
is a serine/threonine protein kinase, serving as an energy
sensor, and its activation strongly suppresses cancer cell
proliferation. Zipper interacting protein kinase (ZIPK),
also known as death associated protein kinase 3, is a
serine/threonine kinase that mediates apoptosis in cancer
cells. Of note, resisting cell death and deregulating cellular
energetics are the two hallmarks of cancer. Besides, they
have high similarity (54.3%) in their kinase domains.
But, there are differences in some amino acid sites
which make their difference in the tertiary structures.
Thus, simultaneously targeting the two kinases may be a
promising avenue for killing two birds with one stone.
Based upon the two target identification and their
similarity in kinase domains, we synthesized a series of
candidate compounds and found a novel small molecule
activator (BL-AD008), and identified this activator could
induce cervical cancer cell apoptosis by the death-receptor
and mitochondrial pathways. Moreover, in our study, we
found that BL-AD008 bear the good anti-tumor activities
without remarkable toxicities, and also induced apoptosis
by targeting AMPK/ZIPK in vivo. In our study, we found
that ZIPK may play more important role than AMPK by

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Retrieving functional genomics data
Diverse sets of biological evidence were collected
from several online databases to build the global PPI
network. To predict pair-wise protein–protein relationship,
all the data were preprocessed into pair-wise scores,
reflecting the similarity between protein pairs. And,
five online databases included protein interaction data
from Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD)
[33], Biomolecular Object Network Databank (BOND)
[34], IntAct [35], HomoMINT [36] and BioGRID [37].
Thus, Gold Standard Positive (GSP) interaction set was
constructed by these online databases. Gold Standard
Negative (GSN) interaction set was defined through
protein pairs in which one protein was from the plasma
membrane cellular componentand the other was from the
nuclear cellular component, as assigned by Gene Ontology
(GO) Consortium. 23,169,177 unique pairs, in total, were
identified except for 5,275 overlapping pairs with GSP.
Additionally, the data in Standard Test Set (STS) were
retrieved from Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP) [38]
and matched randomly by these proteins, and apoptotic
proteins were from GO annotation. Raw data were
constructed by randomly matching amongst all the human
proteins in UniProt database.

Multiple sources of biological data
Gene co-expression profiles: Proteins that can
interact with each other often possess similar gene
expression patterns; thereby, genes that can co-express
should be more likely to interact than genes that cannot
co-express. To identify genes that are co-expressed, we
used microarray data of HeLa cells and primary human
lung fibroblasts treated with 2.5mM DTT to measure the
pair-wise co-expression level of related genes in apoptosis
[39]. The co-expression level is calculated as Pearson

n

ρ X ,Y =

∑ ( X i − X )(Yi − Y )
i =1

LR( E1 ,..., En ) =

(n − 1)σ X σ Y

then Oposterior = Oprior*LR. As Naive Bayesian
model supposes that each of the evidence is
conditional independent, we can simplify LR as

Where X and Y are expression level data vectors of

length n for two genes, X and Y are means, and σX and
σY are the standard deviations.
Domain-domain interaction (DDI): Because
protein interactions involve physical associations
between protein domains, it is proposed that novel protein
interactions may be predicted by identifying the pairs of
domains enriched amongst known interacting proteins. To
test this logic into the context of our GSP and GSN sets,
domain-domain interaction relationships were downloaded
from Pfam [40].
Cross-species interolog mapping: The human
orthologs of model organism proteins often retain similar
function; therefore, pair of human orthologs that interact
in a model organism are likely to interact in human. Model
organisms [Caenorhabditis elegans (4,649), Drosophila
melanogaster (5,527), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2,154),
Rattus norvegicus (15,306), Mus musculus (16,376), and
Escherichia coli (541)] were mapped into human protein
pairs, by gene orthologs defined in the Inparanoid database
by clustering into orthologous groups.
Smallest shared biological process (SSBP):
Interacting proteins often function in the same biological
process, and proteins functioning in small, specific
processes should be more likely to interact than proteins
functioning in large, general processes. The procedure
was used to quantify functional similarity between two
proteins: 1) to identify all biological process terms shared
by two proteins; 2) to count how many other proteins
were assigned to each of the shared terms; 3) to identify
the shared biological process term with the smallest
count. In general, the smaller and the more specific is
the biological process term, which indicates the greater
functional similarity between two proteins. Protein pairs
were binned by this measure of functional similarity and
then the degree of similarity was tested for its ability to
predict PPIs.

n

LR( E1 ,..., En ) = ∏ LR( Ei )

As the prior odds is a constant,
the composite LR corresponding to a type of specific
biological evidence can be used to measure the predictive
power or confidence degree for predicting functional
links. A cutoff of likelihood ratio (LR cut) is represented
as an indicator whether a protein pair bears the functional
relation. Then, we filter the initial networks through Naïve
Bayesian model by selecting the pairs with composite LR
above the cutoff. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve can elucidate the relationship between the sensitivity
and specificity of a binary classifier system for different
cut points [42]. The ROC curve can be represented
equivalently by plotting the fraction of true positive rate
(TPR) versus the fraction of false-positive rate (FPR).
Sensitivity and specificity can measure the ability of a
classifier to identify true positives and false positives in
a test, and calculated as sensitivity= TP/positives, and
specificity = 1 – (FP/negatives), where TP and FP are the
number of true positives and false positives identified by a
classifier, respectively; whereas positives and negatives are
the total number of positives and negatives in a test. The
area under the ROC curve is an indicator of the efficacy of
the assessment system. Thus, the performances of different
classifiers appear to be comparable by measuring the ROC
curves, suggesting that the larger the ROC curve is; the
better the performance is.
i =1

Hub protein identification in apoptosis
We identified hub proteins implicated in core
apoptotic pathways according to the following four
golden standards: 1) the degree of each protein: we
selected the number of degrees which is bigger than or
equal to 300. 2) The link number of apoptotic protein:
we choose the number of links to other known apoptotic
proteins that are bigger than or equal to 300 (the standard
of classical hub proteins) or 200 (the standard of novel hub
proteins) respectively. 3) Network topology: we suggest
that hub proteins often enrich in the “dense area” rather
than “sparse area” in cancer. 4) Significance analysis of
microarrays (SAM) analysis is performed on data from
expression microarray in apoptotic stress to identify genes
with greatly divergent expressions between normal and
cancer cells; thus, we indicated that the proteins, identified
as divergent expression proteins that were extracted as
functional hub protein.

Integration and evaluation of biological data into
the Naïve Bayesian model
We develop a Naive Bayesian model to integrate
diverse data and make the final interaction predictions in
an integrated way [41]. Following the Bayesian theorem,
we compute the posterior odds given n evidence as
follows:

ο posterior =

P( positive | E1 ,..., En )
P(negative | E1 ,..., En )

Where positive means that two proteins are

The initial three dimensional geometric coordinates
of the X-ray crystal structure of AAPK1 (AMPK, PDB
code: 2V8Q) and DAPK3 (ZIPK, PDB code: 3BHY)
were downloaded from the Protein Databank (PDB),
respectively. And, we constructed the screening library for
them containing all the small molecule compounds from
the latest version of Drugbank (http://www.drugbank.
ca/) and ZINC (http://zinc.docking.org/), respectively.
The activators were constructed using the Accelrys
Discovery Studio (version 3.5; Accelrys, SanDiego, CA,
USA) molecular modeling software and were energy
minimized with the CHARMm force field. Docking and
MD simulation were performed according to our previous
reports [43, 44]. The CDOCKER protocol was employed
as docking approach to conduct semi-flexible docking.
5 ns MD simulations were carried out for AMPK-BLAD008 and ZIPK–BL-AD008 complexes. The protein–
ligand binding free energy was calculated based on 300
snapshots taken from 2 to 5 ns MD simulation trajectories
of the complex.

Cell viability assay
The HeLa and C4-I cells were dispensed in 96-well
flat bottom microtiter plates at a density of 5×104 cells/
ml. After 24 h incubation, they were treated with different
concentrations of A1 and BL-AD008 for the indicated
time periods, respectively. Cell viability was measured by
the 3-(4, 5-dimetrylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay.

Apoptosis assay
The HeLa cells were seeded into 6-well culture
plates with or without BL-AD008 and cultured for 24 h,
then incubated with 500 μL hoechst 33258 or rhodamin
123 staining solution in the dark at 37 °C for 30 min and
observed under fluorescence microscope. Apoptotic ratio
was measured by Annexin-V-FLUOS Staining Kit (Roche,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s protocol
followed by FACScan flow cytometry analysis (Becton
Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ).

Chemical synthesis of candidate compounds
All reactions requiring anhydrous conditions were
performed under an Ar or N2 atmosphere. Chemicals and
solvents were either A.R. grade or purified by standard
techniques. Thin layer chromatography (TLC): silica gel
plates GF254; compounds were visualized by irradiation
with UV light and/or by treatment with a solution of
phosphomolybdic acid (20% wt. in ethanol) followed by
heating. Column chromatography was performed by using
silica gel with eluent given in parentheses. 1H NMR and
13
C-NMR analysis was determined on a Bruker Avance
III 400MHz spectrometer and performed using CDCl3 or
DMSO-d6 as a solvent at room temperature. The chemical
shifts are expressed in relative to TMS (=0 ppm) and
the coupling constants J in Hz. The purity of compound
screened in biological assays was determined to be ≥97%
by HPLC (Agilent 1100 HPLC system) analysis with a
photodiode array detector, An atlantis C18 (150 mm × 4.6
mm, i.d. 5μm) (Waters, Milford, Mass, USA) was used
with a gradient elution of methanol and HPLC-grade water
as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. HRMS data
were obtained using Bruker micro-TOF-Q instrument or
TOF-MS instrument.

Western blot analysis
The HeLa cells were treated with 600nM BL-AD008
for 0, 12, 24, 36 and 48h respectively. Both adherent
and floating cells were collected, and then western blot
analysis was carried out by the method as follow. The
cell pellets were resuspended with lysis buffer consisting
of Hepes 50 mmol/L pH 7.4, Triton-X-100 1%, sodium
orthovanada 2 mmol/L, sodium fluoride 100 mmol/L,
edetic acid 1 mmol/ L, PMSF 1 mmol/L, aprotinin 10
mg/L and leupeptin 10 mg/L and lysed at 4°C for 1 h. After
14,000×g centrifugation for 15 min, the protein content of
supernatant was determined by the Bio-Rad DC protein
assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Equal
amounts of the total protein were separated by 10-15 %
SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes, the
membranes were soaked in blocking buffer (5 % skimmed
milk). Proteins were detected using primary antibodies,
followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and
visualized by using ECL as the HRP substrate.
