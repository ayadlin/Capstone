ABSTRACT
Lycorine, a natural alkaloid extracted from the Amaryllidaceae plant family, has
been reported to exhibit a wide range of physiological effects, including the potential
effect against cancer. However, the anti-prostate cancer (PCa) efficacy of Lycorine
remains unrevealed. In this context, we figured out Lycorine’s anti-proliferative and
anti-migratory properties for PCa treatment. Lycorine inhibited proliferation of various
PCa cell lines, induced cell apoptosis and cell death. Here we showed that Lycorine
decreased proliferation, migration, invasion, survival and EMT of prostate cancer cell
lines. Subcutaneous and orthotopic xenotransplantations by ectopic implantation of
the human hormone-refractory PC-3M-luc cells were used to confirm in vivo anticancer
effects of Lycorine. Lycorine inhibited both growth and metastasis in multiple organs
(liver, lung, kidney, spleen and bone) in vivo and improved mice survival. Lycorine
prevented EGF-induced JAK/STAT signaling. Importantly, anti-cancer effects of
Lycorine were dependent on STAT expression. We suggest that Lycorine is a potential
therapeutic in prostate cancer.

medicinal plant-derived phenanthridine Amaryllidaceae
alkaloid [4], seems to possess such properties for PCa
drug research and development.
Lycorine is a pyrrolo[de]phenanthridine ringtype alkaloid extracted from Amaryllidaceae genera
and possesses various biological effects including
anti-tumor [5], antiviral [6], antimalarial [7] and
antiinflammation [8]. Although Lycorine does not have a
defined target or mechanism of action, it is a candidate
anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer drug. For instance, the
drug, which contains Lycorine as effective component,
has been clinically used in Russian as an expectorant to
treat chronic and acute inflammatory processes in lungs
and bronchial diseases [9]. Recently, a new function of
Lycorine in promoting hematopoietic stem and progenitor
cell (HSPC) niche colonization has been reported.
Lycorine increases HSPC lodgement during development
and ultimately leads to a sustained increase in the size of
the stem cell pool into adulthood [10]. Several studies
have shown that Lycorine exhibits anti-cancer activities.
For example, it has selective cytotoxicity effects on

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the principle malignant
tumor threatening the health of senile male all over the
world. According to the latest statistics, PCa accounts
for 27% of all cancer incidences and ranks the second
leading cause of cancer-related mortality among men
in the US  [1]. PCa first manifests as an androgendependent (AD) disease and can be treated with androgen
deprivation therapy, but it will eventually progresses
from AD to androgen independent (AI). The hormonerefractory PCa is the end stage of AI and causes the
majority of PCa patient deaths [2]. It is estimated that by
January 1, 2024, the whole cancer survivors in American
will increase to nearly 19 million and PCa will still be
the most prevalent cancer among males. The massive
survivorship indicates that the treatment of PCa is an
encouraging cancer research direction [3]. With the
increasing incidence, mortality, and survivorship, there
is an urgent need for novel drugs that can radically cure
PCa, especially the hormone-refractory PCa. Lycorine, a

leukemia, cervical cancer and multiple myeloma [11–16].
However, so far, there is no research about Lycorine’s
effects in PCa. Accumulating evidences indicate that
abnormalities in JAK/STAT pathway are involved in the
oncogenesis of several cancers [17]. Many researches
confirm STAT3 as a causal role in oncogenesis, and
provide validation of STAT3 as an oncotarget for cancer
drug discovery [18]. Also, several studies propose that
abnormalities in STAT3 pathway causes the oncogenesis
of PCa [19]. Furthermore, recent studies identify STAT3
as a direct transcriptional activator of Twist, which is
one of the most important drivers promoting epithelial
mesenchymal transition (EMT) [20]. Moreover, the
activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
signaling pathway induces cancer cell EMT via STAT3mediated Twist gene expression. Epidermal growth
factor (EGF) increases Twist transcripts and protein in
EGFR-expressing lines. Continuously activated STAT3
significantly promotes Twist transcription. EGFR
cooperates with STAT3 to induce EMT in cancer cells
via increasing Twist gene expression [21]. Overall, the
impairment of STAT3 activation can inhibit tumor growth
and metastasis. Therefore, targeting STAT3 is a valid
strategy for cancer therapy [22]. Currently, some STAT3
inhibitors, including small molecular compounds,
peptides, and oligonucleotides, have been developed to
combat PCa, and it is rational to anticipate their potential
therapeutic value in clinic [23–25].
In our study, we demonstrate that Lycorine is a
novel inhibitor of the growth and metastasis of hormonerefractory PCa. We present that Lycorine inhibits
proliferation, migration, invasion and survival of various
PCa cell lines, induces cell apoptosis and cell death, and
reverses EMT process of prostate cancer cell lines. In vivo
experiments show that intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration
of Lycorine reduces both weight and volume of ectopically
PC-3M subcutaneous xenografts by about 80% while
exhibiting no obvious toxicity. Lycorine also inhibits
PCa growth and metastasis when tested in the PC-3Mluc orthotopic xenograft model. Lycorine inhibits the
activation of EGF induced JAK/STAT signaling and
multiple STAT3 downstream targets, such as cyclin D1,
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), and
the EMT promoter Twist. Importantly, these anti-cancer
effects of Lycorine are dependent on STAT3 expression.
In conclusion, our findings suggest that Lycorine is a
potential therapeutic in prostate cancer.

the hormone-refractory PCa, 4 typical malignant
hormone-refractory PCa cell lines, PC-3M, DU145,
LNCaP and 22RV1, as well as a human normal prostate
epithelium immortalized cell line PNT1A, were subjected
to the MTS assay. Fig. 1A showed the chemical structure
of Lycorine. As shown in Fig. 1B, Lycorine inhibited
cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in the
abovementioned 4 PCa cell lines, and the IC50 ranged
from 5 μM to 10 μM. Fig. 1B also showed Lycorine had
little effects on PNT1A cell’s proliferation. Collectively,
Lycorine had appreciable selectivity between normal human
epithelial cells and cancer cells. Furthermore, Fig.  1C
illustrated that Lycorine inhibited PCa proliferation in a
time- and dose-dependent manner on these 4 PCa cell lines.
To determine the effects of Lycorine on PCa metastasis,
we performed cell migration and invasion assays using cell
line PC-3M with highly malignant mobility. Lycorine, in a
dose-dependent manner, significantly inhibited PC-3M cell
wound healing (Fig. 1D), migration (Fig. 1E), and invasion
(Fig. 1F).

Lycorine retards PCa cell growth in vitro
through inducing apoptosis
To further determine the function of Lycorine’s antiproliferation activity to PCa cells, the colony formation
assay was conducted. Results showed that Lycorine (5 μM)
significantly inhibited 4 PCa cell lines, PC-3M, DU145,
LNCaP and 22RV1’s colony formation (Fig. 2A). Statistical
results of these 4 cell lines’ colony formation under the
treatment of Lycorine were shown in Supplementary
Fig. S1A. In addition, the live/dead staining was used to
test Lycorine’s toxicity to PCa cells. As shown in Fig. 2B,
Lycorine potentiated PC-3M cell death. Lycorine did not
induce cell-cycle arrest (Supplementary Fig. S1B, left)
and the statistical result showed no significant difference
between the cell-cycle distributions (Supplementary
Fig. S1B, right), but  Lycorine caused a dose-dependent
induction of apoptosis in PC-3M cells. Apoptotic
cells raised from 10.04% to 54.08% with the Lycorine
concentration increased from 0 μM to 50 μM after 48-hour
treatment (Fig. 2C). Similarly, Lycorine also induced cell
apoptosis in DU145 and LNCaP cells (data not shown)
and Fig. 2D illustrated the statistical results of Lycorine’s
apoptotic effects to 3 PCa cells. And clear cleavages of
PARP and caspase-3 occurred when treated with Lycorine
(Fig.  2E). All these results suggested that Lycorine
suppressed PCa cell growth through its proapoptotic effects.

could be concluded that Lycorine significantly suppressed
the tumor growth of PCa. The average tumor volume of

bioluminescence was detected in the whole parts of mice
abdomen and increased remarkably with day number
increase (Fig. 3D). Treatment with Lycorine statistically
reduced the photo flux indexes (Fig. 3D). Administration of
10 mg/kg/day of Lycorine almost completely blocked tumor
growth. As Fig. 3E showed, at the day 30 the nude mice
were sacrificed and the orthotopic xenografts were stripped
for photograph. The average normalized photon  flux of
the 5 mg/kg/day Lycorine treated group and 10 mg/kg/day
Lycorine treated group was (41 ± 2.34) × 105p/sec/cm2/sr
and (23 ± 4.01) × 105p/sec/cm2/sr, respectively, while that
of vehicle control group was (82 ± 5.78) × 105p/sec/cm2/sr
(Fig. 3D). Supplymentary Fig. S1D showed the statistical
result of final volumes of orthotopic xenografts. At day 30,
for the whole 20 mice in each group, 6 mice died in the
control group, while the number was 4 and 2 for the 5 mg/
kg/day Lycorine treated group and 10 mg/kg/day Lycorine

treated group, respectively (Fig. 3F). When referring to
Lycorine’s biosafety, treatment of Lycorine at the given
concentration had little effect on mice body weights
(Fig. S1E), and this finding confirmed to previous published
results that Lycorine had low toxicity to mouse at the
curative dose [16]. The anatomy results of sacrificed mice
in the 10 mg/kg/day group showed no obvious pathological
change on main organs, when compared to the control
group (Fig. S1F). In addition, Lycorine inhibited PCa tumor
metastasis in the orthotopic tumor growth and metastasis
model. After dissection, photo signals were detected in
typical metastatic target organs (liver, lung, kidney, spleen
and bone), as well as orthotopic prostate and lymph node
(Fig. 4A). And Lycorine significantly decreased metastatic
nodes numbers in target organs (Fig. 4B). Together, our data
indicated that administration of Lycorine therapeutically
blocked PCa tumor growth and metastasis.

Lycorine reverses EGF-induced EMT
in PCa cells

Interestingly, when we explored the growth and
metastasis related signal pathways by H&E staining
and immunohistochemistry analysis, we found the
expression of E-cadherin and CL-caspase 3 increased,
while the expression of p-STAT3 and Ki-67 decreased in
Lycorine-injected mice tumors in a dose of 10 mg/kg/
day, compared to the control group (Fig. 4C). This
finding suggested that Lycorine might suppress the
STAT3 pathway and have relationship with the reversal
of EMT in vivo. Fig. 4D exhibited the statistical
results of these four tumor progression markers.
In summary, these in vivo immunohistochemistry
results are in agreement with our in vitro results and
indicate that Lycorine therapeutically suppresses
PCa tumor growth and metastasis in orthotopic
xenograft model.

Tumor cell migration and invasion are dependent on
epithelial cells increasing their ability to migrate through a
process named EMT, and EMT is strongly induced by EGF
signaling in PCa and other cancer types [26–29]. As one of
the most important EMT markers and a master regulator
of morphogenesis, Twist plays an essential role in tumor
metastasis, and can be considered as an oncotarget [30].
Previous reports have revealed that EGF directly stimulates
Twist transcription [21, 23] and Twist is a direct target gene
of STAT3 [31]. Therefore, we examined whether Lycorine
had inhibitory effects on EGF-induced EMT. After exposed
to EGF, PC-3M cells became polar and polygen, from the
pebble shape or fusiform to multiple antenna in morphology

(Fig.  5A), decreased the expression of an epithelial cell
marker (E-cadherin), and increased the expression of
mesenchymal cell markers (N-cadherin, vimentin and
fibronectin) (Fig. 5C). In contrast, cells exposed to Lycorine
had a dose-dependent decrease in expression of N-cadherin,
vimentin and fibronectin and a corresponding increase in
E-cadherin expression (Fig. 5C) and the morphology change
had been largely reversed to the epithelial cell like stage
(Fig. 5A). Because in previous studies STAT3 decreased
E-cadherin expression and stimulated EMT by repression
of the transcriptional factor Twist, we have assessed
both protein and RNA levels of Twist in PC-3M cells.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We observed a significant decrease in Twist mRNA level in
response to Lycorine (Fig. 5B). This result was consistent
with the increased E-cadherin expression (Fig. 5C). Our
results clearly demonstrate that Lycorine promotes the
epithelial cell characteristics and suppresses mesenchymal
features in PC-3M cells. RT-PCR result (Fig. 5B)
confirmed that EGF -induced EMT was significantly
blocked by Lycorine through inhibiting the expression of
Twist, whereas N-cadherin, vimentin and fibronectin levels
were decreased by Lycorine (Fig. 5B and 5C). Because
Lycorine caused EMT reversal in PC-3M cells, it was rea­
sonable to expect a decreased migration potential as well.

Our data showed that Lycorine significantly suppressed the
expression of migration markers, MMP2 and MMP9, as well
as the activated STAT3 levels under the stimulation of EGF
(Fig. 5D). All these results suggest that Lycorine suppresses
EGF-induced EMT.

STAT3, we used the 3 cell line models, DU145, LNCaP,
PC-3M, that expressed different amounts of STAT3 and
p-STAT3 (Fig. 5E), and tested their response to Lycorine.
Fig. 5F showed that in PC-3M cell, which had the most
amount of STAT3/p-STAT3 level, exhibited the largest
response to Lycorine in the migration assay. Using a
standard procedure to measure cell migration, we observed
a significant decrease in the percentage of migrated cells
due to STAT3 expression as compared between these
3  cell lines (Fig. 5F). For DU145 and LNCaP cells,
although their migration were also abrogated by Lycorine,

the inhibition effect was less than that in PC-3M. Besides,
for further investigation whether STAT3 is involved in
Lycorine’s inhibition in PCa cells growth and metastasis,
PC-3M cells were treated with 10 μM or 25 μM Lycorine
for 48 hours following transient transfection with STAT3
siRNA, and Western blotting was performed (Fig. 5G).
PC-3Ms transfected with STAT3 siRNA displayed reduced
levels of endogenous STAT3 expression (Fig. 5G, upper).
Lycorine induced a dramatic decrease in cell viability in
STAT3 high- expression cells transfected with control or
STAT3 sramble siRNA, whereas no significant decrease
of cell viability was observed in STAT3 knockdown cells
(Fig. 5G, bottom). Taken together, all these data indicate
that STAT3 is involved in Lycorine induced inhibition
to PCa cells and the anti-cancer effects of Lycorine are
dependent on STAT3 expression.

Lycorine suppressed DNA-binding activity of STAT3 by
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Our results
showed that Lycorine decreased STAT3 DNA-binding
activity to its typical target genes such as Bcl-xL, cyclin
D1 and Twist in a concentration-dependent manner,
with effective concentrations around 10 μM (Fig.  6B).
Lycorine effectively regressed STAT3’s translocation
from cytoplasm to nuclei under the stimulation of EGF
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). Q-PCR analysis confirmed
that STAT3 target genes were down-regulated by Lycorine
(Supplementary Fig. S2B and S2C). To further address
such a possibility, we examined the inhibitory effect of
Lycorine on STAT3 in its target genes’ protein levels and
similar results were observed (Supplementary Fig. S2D).
In summary, as Fig. 6C sketched, all these results prove
that Lycorine blocks tumor growth and metastasis by
suppressing STAT3 transcriptional activity in PCa cells.

Lycorine suppresses STAT3 transcriptional
activity in PCa cells

DISCUSSION

It’s well-known that activation of STAT3 culminates
in the transcription of its target genes and that EGF
signaling relevant to tumor growth and metastasis
is partially mediated by JAK1/2 phosphorylation.
Therefore, we tested the action of Lycorine on these
critical receptor tyrosine kinases. We found that Lycorine
significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3
(Tyr705) under the stimulation of EGF (Fig.  6A).
And such inhibitory action was in parallel with a rapid
dephosphorylation of upstream kinases of STAT3,
including JAK1 (Tyr1, 022/1, 023) and JAK2 (Tyr1,
007/1, 008) (Fig. 6A). STAT3 translocation to the nucleus
results in a specific DNA binding that in turn increases
target gene transcription; we next determined whether

Men with hormone-refractory PCa are at high
risk for developing distant metastasis, which results
in clinically significant disability and mortality [32].
Although great therapeutic advances in hormonerefractory PCa has been made, it’s still inevitable came
along with the treatment failure [33]. Chemotherapy
is useful currently in metastatic castrate-resistant PCa.
The key drugs are docetaxel and cabazitaxel since
two randomized trials have proven their efficacy  [34].
Several agents, such as selenium, lycopene, soy
products, green tea, pomegranate phenolics, apigenin,
and vitamins D and E, are effective in the prevention of
PCa [35–38]. However, there is still a limited number of
agents that are effective and selective in the prevention

and/or treatment of late-stage hormone-refractory PCa.
Our principle findings in this study show that the antitumor activity of Lycorine toward PCa at physiologically
achievable concentrations is moderate. We present
that Lycorine induces apoptosis and inhibits migration
and invasion of hormone-refractory PCa cells (Fig. 1).
Administration of Lycorine delays tumor growth and
metastasis and reduces both tumor weight and volume
and distant metastasis (Fig. 3 and 4). In addition, Lycorine
abrogates the expression of p-STAT3 (Fig. 4C). All these
results provide a characterization of the unique anti-tumor
properties of Lycorine as a potential candidate for the
treatment of hormone-refractory PCa.
Another significant result in this study is that
Lycorine reverses EMT through STAT3 mediated
Twist decrease, thus exhibits a novel mechanism
that Lycorine inhibits cancer metastasis. PCa cells in
metastasized tumors are known to display both epithelial
and mesenchymal phenotypes including morphology and
gene expression profiles, and metastatic prostate tumors
are likely comprised of heterogeneous populations of
both epithelial and mesenchymal cells. With regard to
the mechanism of interconversion between epithelial
and mesenchymal phenotypes through EMT and MET,
it is interesting to notice the induction by growth factor
engagement [39]. Previous reports imply EGFR signaling
are implicated in PCa progression and EGF promotes
disassembly of cell–cell junctions, decrease of E-cadherin
and increase of Twist. These effects are dependent on
activation of STAT3 as a mediator of EGF/EGFR-driven
cell migration and EMT. Knockdown of endogenous
STAT3 also prevents EGFR-mediated EMT and cell
migration [40]. Additionally, some reports declaimed
that targeting PCa cell EMT could be an attractive new
therapeutic direction for the inhibition of PCa [41]. Our
research for the first time uncovered this links between
Lycorine, STAT3 and EMT. Because many types of cancer
cells express STAT3 and EMT is a typical phenomenon
upon metastatic stimuli, such as growth factor, Lycorine
may have functions in inhibiting other tumor metastasis
via the same mechanism that revealed in our research.
Lycorine has been suggested to exert its antitumor activity in leukemia and in solid tumors through
pro-apoptotic effects [11–14]. In this study, Lycorine
provides significant therapeutic benefit in mice bearing
grafts of the PC-3M model at non-toxic doses. Thus,
Lycorine may be an excellent candidate to combat PCa.
Besides, a previous report declares Lycorine is able to
cross the blood brain barrier and induces no CYP3A4
inhibitory activity [42]. All of these properties make
Lycorine potential for clinic application. Indeed, treatment
with Lycorine inhibited tumor xenograft growth and
metastasis and increased the overall health and survival
of nude mice implanted with PC-3M-luc cells. However,
these effects were measured in tumors obtained from
only one cancer cell lines. To better utilize Lycorine’s

therapeutic potential, further investigations are needed to
be performed on other types of xenografts using different
PCa cell lines. Furthermore, researches to determine
Lycorine’s underlying mechanisms besides STAT3 in PCa
are warranted.
Conclusively, this study is the first research to
examine Lycorine’s anti-cancer mechanistic role of JAK/
STAT3 signaling in PCa tumor growth and metastasis
and identify a perturbance in a plethora of JAK/STAT
signaling proteins in PCa. Our results support Lycorine as
a potent candidate for drug repositioning with advantages
of toxicity and pharmacokinetics profiles already known as
well as time-and cost-saving. To finish, our study proves
evidences that STAT3 is a potential therapeutic target for
PCa treatment and strengthens the possibility of Lycorine
as a natural product drug in anticancer therapy and shows
promise for future clinical translation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture, animals and reagents
Hormone-refractory PCa cell line PC-3M, LNCaP,
22RV1 and DU145 were purchased from ATCC. PNT1A
(a human normal prostate epithelium immortalized cell
line) was a kind gift from Professor Hanyi Zhuang of
Shanghai Jiaotong University. PC-3M cells and DU145
cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle
Medium (Gibco). PNT1A, 22RV1 and LNCaP cells were
maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco). Both mediums
were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Wisent).
In addition, PC-3M cells were transfected with pGL4
vector (Promega) which stably expressed luciferase and
selected in G418 to screen the stable PC-3M-luc cell line.
All cells were incubated at 37°C of 5% humidified CO2.
Mice were obtained from National Rodent Laboratory
Animal Resources, Shanghai Branch of China. All animal
experimental protocols were approved by the Animal
Investigation Committee of the Institute of Biomedical
Sciences, East China Normal University. Lycorine
(purity >98%) was purchased from Shanghai Winherb
Medical Science. A 50 mM stock solution was prepared in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma), stored at −20°C and
diluted as needed in cell culture medium. Recombinant
human EGF was obtained from BD Biosciences. Most
appropriate antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology, unless otherwise specified.

Cell viability assay
Cell viability of corresponding cells was determined
by MTS assay according to previous methods [43]. PCa
cells and PNT1A (5 × 103 cells/well) were treated with
various concentrations of Lycorine for 48 h or indicated
time. The Aqueous One Solution (Promega) was used
according to manufacturer instructions, and the absorption

of 490 nm was measured. Three independent experiments
with triplicate were carried out.

The live or dead status of cells was determined by
live/dead reagent (Invitrogen), which was used to measure
intracellular esterase activity and plasma membrane
integrity [45]. The cell-permeable green fluorescent dye
Calcein AM (Ex/Em = 488/518 nm) is used to stain
live cells. Dead cells can be easily stained by EthD-II,
a cell non-permeable red fluorescent dye (Ex/Em =
488/615 nm). Stained live and dead cells can be visualized
by fluorescence microscopy using a band-pass filter
(detects FITC and rhodamine).

Migration assay
The inhibition of tumor cell migration by Lycorine
was determined by wound-healing migration assay
and chamber migration assay. Briefly, tumor cells were
allowed to grow into full confluence in 6-well plates, then
the “wounds” were created by a sterile pipette tip. Fresh
medium containing 10% FBS and various concentrations
of Lycorine was added. After 12 h incubation at 37°C,
cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and
photographed. The migrated cells were manually
quantified. The percentage inhibition of migrated cells
was expressed using the untreated group as 100%.
Besides, cell migration assay by Transwell/Boyden
chambers (8 μm; BD Biosciences) was also conducted.
Serum-starved PCa cells (5 × 104 cells) in 100 μL medium
with 0.5% FBS were pretreated with Lycorine (from
0 μM to 10 μM) for 30 minutes. Cells were then seeded
on the upper chamber of Transwell and migrated to the
lower chamber with 600 μL medium. After 5 to 7 hours
incubation, non-migrated cells were removed with
cotton swabs, and migrated cells were fixed with cold
3.7% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal
violet. Images were taken with an inverted microscope
(Olympus; magnification, × 100), and migrated cells in
4 random fields were quantified by manual counting. Three
independent experiments with triplicate were carried out.

Cell cycle analysis
Cell cycle analysis was conducted as described
[44]. PCa cells were treated with Lycorine for 36 hours
followed by PBS washes. Cells were then fixed with cold
70% ethanol at 4°C for at least 12 hours. PI working
solution was added before flow cytometry analysis (FACS
Calibur, BD biosciences).

Apoptosis assay
Apoptosis was measured using the Apoptosis
Detection Kit (BD Biosciences) as described [44].
PCa cells were treated with Lycorine for 48 hours then
collected, washed, and stained with annexin V–FITC and
PI for 15 minutes before evaluation by flow cytometry
(FACS Calibur, BD biosciences).

Invasion assay

Western blotting

Invasion assay was also performed using Transwell/
Boyden chambers coated with Matrigel as described
previously [44]. In brief, after 12 hours pretreatment
with indicated concentrations of Lycorine in 6-well plate,
tumor cells were detached with trypsin and resuspended
as signal cells. A total of 5 × 104 cells in 100 μL of serumfree medium were added in the upper chamber, and 600 μL
of complete medium were added at the bottom. Different
concentrations of Lycorine were added to both chambers.
The cells were allowed to invade for 12 h at 37°C. Invaded
cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet and counted
manually. The percentage of inhibition was expressed with
control as 100%.

PCa cells were treated with Lycorine for indicated
time and concentration; then lysed in RIPA buffer.
Primary tumors were well minced, and also lysed with
RIPA buffer. Protein concentration was determined using
a Bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo Scientific). Protein
samples were run on 8% to 12% SDS-PAGE gels and
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes
(Gibco). The membranes were incubated overnight using
specific antibodies. The signals were visualized via the
Odyssey Western blotting detection system.

Immunofluorescence staining assay
For immunofluorescence staining of tumor cells,
human PCa cells were plated onto gelatin-coated cover
slips. After treatment with or without Lycorine (as
indicated in the figures) for 24 hrs, cells were fixed with
3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature,
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and
then blocked with 1% BSA for 1 hr. Cells were incubated
with STAT3 antibody (as indicated in the figures)
overnight. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated
with the appropriate secondary antibody for 1 hr.
4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was further used

Tumor cell clonogenic assay
To mimic individual cell development into
macroscopic cell clones, the cell clonogenic assay was
performed as previously described [44]. Tumor cells were
seeded into 6-well plate and allowed to grow for 24 h.
Cells were then treated with different concentrations of
Lycorine. On the 8th day, colonies were fixed in 3.7%
paraformaldehyde, stained with 0.1% crystal violet and
counted manually.

externalized and extended with a cotton swab to reveal
the seminal vesicles and the dorsum of the prostate.
All procedures were performed in sterile environment.
PC-3M-luc cells (5 × 105 in 0.02 mL PBS per mouse)
were orthotopically transplantated into the dorsa lope of
prostate of nude mice after anaesthetized by pentobarbital
sodium. Seven days later, based on photon flux indexes
detected by Xenogen IVIS 2000 Luminal Imager, all mice
bearing tumor were divided into three groups (n = 20 per
group) randomly and from that day on, the luminal photos
were taken and photon flux indexes which could represent
the orthotopic tumor sizes were recorded every 5 days.
Lycorine (5 mg/kg/day per mouse and 10 mg/kg/day per
mouse) was injected intraperitoneally every day. The
control group was treated with DMSO. 30 days later, mice
were sacrificed, and tumors in prostates were removed and
images were recorded. To assess metastasis, the residual
fluorescence of multiple organs (liver, lung, kidney, spleen
and bone) was measured. The growth rate curve of the
tumor xenograft was evaluated by determining the photon
flux indexes. The mouse body weight was measured every
2 days. Prostate tumor xenografts were fixed and prepared
for immunohistochemistry.

Real time PCR
RNA was reverse transcribed with miScript II RT
Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The resulting cDNA was used for real time
PCR analysis. For individual mRNA quantification we
used miScript Primer Assays. For polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) analysis, the reactions were performed in a
Thermal iCycler (Biorad, Hercules, CA). The primers and
probes for Bcl-2, Bax, cyclin D1, β-Actin [45], E-cadherin
and Twist [31] were used as previously described. All
primers were synthesized by Invitrogen and checked for
specificity before use.

Quantitative real-time PCR
The RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR
were performed as described previously [46]. Cells were
harvested by brief centrifugation directly after cell sorting
or after treatment with Lycorine, and pellets were stored
for RNA isolation. Primers sequences were as previously
reported [45]. All primers were synthesized by Invitrogen
and checked for specificity before use.

Immunohistochemistry analysis
Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously
reported [44]. Primary tumors and mets were excised,
fixed and embedded in paraffin. To investigate the effect of
Lycorine on tumor cells proliferation and apoptosis in vivo,
sections (4 μm) were stained with anti-proliferation cell
nuclear antigen (Ki-67), cleaved caspase-3, p-STAT3 and
E-cadherin. Images were obtained with Leica microscope
(Leica, DM4000b). The results were analyzed using
Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software.

STAT3 siRNA assay
Interference of STAT3 by small interfering RNA
was performed as previously described [47]. Briefly, PCa
cells were plated onto a 3.5-cm dish and allowed to adhere
for 16 h. Cells were transiently transfected with either the
recombinant STAT3-siRNA or the non-targeting scrambled
siRNA in complete medium for 48 h. Cells were washed
and transferred to complete medium for another 48 h and
then harvested for the subsequent experiments.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay

PC-3M subcutaneous xenograft animal model

PC-3M cells were treated with various
concentrations (0, 1, 5, 10, and 25 μM) of Lycorine for
48 hours, fixed with 1% formaldehyde, and lysed as
described previously [45]. Chromatin samples were
immunoprecipitated with antibodies against STAT3
or with normal rabbit IgG antibody and examined by
quantitative PCR using the SYBR Premix Ex Taq Kit
(TaKaRa Biotechnology).

PC-3M cells (1 × 10 in 0.1mL PBS per mouse)
were inoculated subcutaneously on the right back sides of
the mice. After the tumors reached about 100 mm3, mice
were divided into 3 groups and received i.p injection either
with DMSO or Lycorine (5 mg/kg/day per mouse and
10 mg/kg/day per mouse) every day for 18 days. During
the administration of Lycorine, the body weight and the
tumor size of the mice were monitored every 2 days. Mice
were continually observed until they were sacrificed.

Statistical analysis
Results were statistically analyzed using the
Student’s t test with Microsoft Excel except for
the survival curve and mets statistical result, which
were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 4.02 for
Windows. All experiments were repeated at least three
times. A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

PC-3M-luc orthotopic transplantation
