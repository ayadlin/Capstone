BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) have shown
modest clinical benefit in patients with relapsed nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Down-regulation of
Akt appears to correlate with the antitumor activity of EGFR-TKIs. Akt activates nuclear factor kappa B
(NF-jB), which transcribes genes important for cell survival, invasion, and metastasis. The authors hypothesized that genistein, through the inhibition of NF-jB, could enhance the activity of EGFR-TKIs in NSCLCs.
METHODS: Three NSCLC cell lines with various EGFR mutation status and sensitivities to EGFR-TKIs were
selected: H3255 (L858R), H1650 (del E746-A750), and H1781 (wild-type EGFR). Cells were treated with
erlotinib, gefitinib, genistein, or the combination of each of the EGFR-TKIs with genistein. Cell survival and
apoptosis were assessed, and expression levels of EGFR, pAkt, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), E-cadherin,
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and NF-jB were measured. RESULTS: Both EGFR-TKIs demonstrated growth inhibition and apoptosis in each of the cell lines, but H1650 and H1781 were much less sensitive. Genistein demonstrated some antitumor activity in all cell lines, but enhanced growth inhibition and apoptosis when
combined with the EGFR-TKIs in each of the cell lines. Both combinations down-regulated NF-jB significantly more than either agent alone in H3255. In addition, the combinations reduced the expression of
EGFR, pAkt, COX-2, and PGE2, consistent with inactivation of NF-jB. CONCLUSIONS: The authors concluded that genistein enhances the antitumor effects of EGFR-TKIs in 3 separate NSCLC cell lines. This
enhanced activity is in part because of greater reduction in the DNA-binding activity of NF-jB when EGFRC 2009 American Cancer Society.

Original Article

Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer1

related mortality in the United States. The 5-year survival of lung cancer patients is only 15%; therefore, there
is a great need to evaluate novel agents for the management of this disease. The current focus of clinical research
in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as in other areas of
oncology, is toward critical molecular pathways that are
involved in tumor cell proliferation, survival, invasion,
and angiogenesis.2
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a receptor
tyrosine kinase, is expressed in many NSCLCs, and is supposed to be involved in tumor cell proliferation, invasion,
angiogenesis, and survival.2-4 Deregulation of EGFR signaling during lung cancer progression are caused by gene
mutations, gene amplification, and formation of autocrine
loops.5 On the basis of promising preclinical data, the
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) erlotinib
and gefitinib were evaluated in patients with NSCLC. The
clinical benefit from these agents in patients with relapsed
NSCLC is modest, with a response rate of 8% to 9%, and
median survival of 6 months to 7 months.6,7
Retrospective analyses of tumors of patients enrolled
in trials with EGFR-TKIs revealed that presence of activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR
gene predicted response and clinical benefit from EGFRTKIs.2,8,9 Subsequently, other investigators have suggested
that increased EGFR gene copy number, EGFR expression,
or presence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
features in tumors may be more predictive of clinical benefit
from EGFR-TKIs.10-12 Induction of EMT may contribute
to the decreased efficacy of therapy in primary and acquired
resistance to gefitinib.13 Thus, the importance of each of
these factors in predicting benefit from these agents remains
to be determined in prospective clinical trials.
The activity of EGFR-TKIs in NSCLCs appears to
be related to their ability to down-regulate Akt.14,15 Akt is
1 of the primary antiapoptotic pathways activated by the
EGFR pathway, and Akt in turn activates nuclear factor
kappa B (NF-jB), leading to the transcription of genes
such as cyclooxygenase 2, survivin, Bcl-xl, and Bcl-2,
which are known to regulate various aspects of cellular
growth, apoptosis, invasion, and angiogenesis.16,17 Li et al
reported that the ratio of p-EGFR to p-Akt was 10-fold
higher in erlotinib-sensitive cells than in erlotinib-resistant cells containing wild-type EGFR gene, suggesting a
predictive parameter for clinical response in NSCLC
2166

tumors.18 The NF-jB activation has been associated with
the initiation and progression of several human cancers.19
Recently, Tang et al evaluated the expression of NF-jB by
immunohistochemistry in tumor specimens of 394
NSCLC patients.20 They found that the majority of tumor specimens had a high level of NF-jB expression. In
addition, higher expression of NF-jB was found more frequently in EGFR and K-ras mutant tumors. These investigators also found that NF-jB expression was much
higher in preneoplastic tissues as compared with normal
bronchial epithelium, and therefore NF-jB activation
may be an early event in lung cancer carcinogenesis.
It is well recognized that the activation of the Akt
pathway, which in turn activates NF-jB, can occur by
EGFR-independent mechanisms, and such activation
may limit the antitumor efficacy of EGFR-TKIs. It is
therefore speculated that the addition of Akt/NF-jB inhibitor to EGFR-TKIs may be more effective in inhibiting the EGFR signaling pathway, and thus may yield
greater antitumor effect.
Genistein is a naturally occurring isoflavone present
in soybeans and, as such, is nontoxic to humans.21 We
have previously shown that genistein, through the inhibition of Akt and NF-jB, can enhance the effects of erlotinib, an EGFR-TKI in pancreatic cancer cell lines.22 In
addition, genistein also enhanced the apoptotic effect of
chemotherapy drugs in H460, a lung cancer cell line,
through the inactivation of NF-jB.23 On the basis of our
previous observations that genistein can inhibit NF-jB in
NSCLC cell lines and can potentiate the antitumor effect
of erlotinib in pancreatic cancer cell lines, we decided to
evaluate whether the addition of genistein has a similar
effect on the antitumor activity of EGFR-TKIs in
NSCLC cell lines. Our results show that the addition of
genistein to EGFR-TKIs enhances the antitumor effect in
NSCLC cell lines. This potentiation effect of genistein is
in part because of down-regulation of the DNA-binding
activity of NF-jB.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture and Reagents
Three NSCLC cell lines with various EGFR mutation status and sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs were used: H3255
(L858R), H1650 (del E746-A750), and H1781 (wild

type). H3255 was a generous gift from the Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts and was grown in
ACL-4 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum.
H1650 and H1781 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Virginia, and grown in RPMI1640 containing 4.5 mg/mL D-glucose, L-glutamine,
2.38 mg/mL HEPES buffer, 1.5 mg/mL sodium bicarbonate, 0.11 mg/mL sodium pyruvate, supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum. Gefitinib and erlotinib were generous gifts from AstraZeneca (Wilmington, Del) and OSI
Pharmaceuticals (Melville, NY), respectively. Cell culture
media were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif).
Cell Growth Inhibition by MTT Assay
The 3 NSCLC cell lines H3255, H1650, and H1781 were
seeded at a density of 3000 to 5000 cells/well in 96-well
plates for 24 hours. Cells were treated with either erlotinib
or gefitinib, (various concentrations of 2.5 nM to 15 lM
based on cell line sensitivity), genistein (12.5 lM to
37.5 lM), and the combination of gefitinib and genistein
or erlotinib and genistein for 72 hours; this was repeated 3
times. Cell survival was determined by a standard MTT
assay by the addition of 100 lL of MTT (1 mg/mL) for 2
hour. The supernatant was removed, and 100 lL of isopropanol was then added. The color intensity was measured by
microplate fluorometer (TECAN, Research Triangle Park,
NC) at 595 nm. Combination index and isobologram for
combination treatment were calculated and plotted using
CalcuSyn software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK).
Quantification of Apoptosis by
Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay
The Cell Death Detection ELISA kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, Ind) was used to detect apoptosis in
untreated and treated H3255, H1650, and H1781 cells.
The assay is based on a photometric enzyme-immunoassay for the qualitative and quantitative determination of
cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments (monoand oligonucleosomes). The assay uses antihistone biotin
antibodies that bind to H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histones, and anti-DNA peroxidase (POD) antibodies that
react with single- and double-stranded DNA. Cells
seeded in 6-well plates were treated with genistein (25
lM), erlotinib (100 nM or 10 lM), or gefitinib (5 nM
or 10 lM) and the combination of gefitinib and genisCancer

tein or erlotinib and genistein. It is important to note
that different concentrations of drugs were used in different cell lines based on their sensitivities to various drugs.
The cells were trypsinized, and approximately 10,000
cells were added to 200 lL of lysis buffer and incubated
at room temperature for 1=2 hour. The cells were centrifuged at 20,000 g for 10 minutes, and 100 lL of the supernatant was transferred into antihistone-coated
microtiter plate and incubated at room temperature for
90 minutes. The plate was washed twice with 200 lL of
washing solution provided with the kit. A solution containing 100 lL of anti-DNA POD dissolved in incubation buffer was added to the same plate and incubated
for 90 minutes. After removal of the unbound antibodies, the nucleosomes were quantified by the POD reaction using ABTS (2,20 -Azino-di[3-ethylbenzthiazolinsulfonat]) as substrate. A microplate fluorometer
(TECAN) was used to measure color intensity at 405
nm. The assay was repeated at least 3 times.

Protein Extraction and Western
Blot Analysis
On the basis of our previous study24 showing the basal level
of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), EGFR and prostaglandin
E2 (PGE2), we decided to determine the baseline expression
of NF-jB by DNA-binding activity. It is known that
EGFR is overexpressed in cancer cells and activates NF-jB,
which in turn activates COX-2, leading to the production
of PGE2. We studied COX-2, EGFR, and pAkt genes
treated with genistein, erlotinib, or gefitinib because these
genes are transcriptionally regulated by NF-jB. H3255,
H1650, and H1781 cells were treated with different concentrations of drugs in different cell lines based on their
sensitivities with erlotinib (100 nM or 10 lM), or gefitinib
(5 nM or 10 lM) or genistein (25 lM) and the combination of gefitinib and genistein or erlotinib and genistein for
72 hours to evaluate the effects of treatment on COX-2,
EGFR, pAkt, E-cadherin, and b-actin expression. Cells
were harvested by scraping from culture plates and collected
by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer
consisting of 250 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5),
5 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS), 50 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium
orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride

(PMSF), 1 lg/mL pepstatin, and protein inhibitor that
contained a broad spectrum of serine, cysteine, and metalloproteases (Roche Applied Science) for 30 minutes on ice.
Cell lysates were centrifuged for 20 minutes. Protein concentration was then measured using the BCA Protein Assay
Kit (Pierce, Rockford, Ill). The samples were loaded on 7%
to 12% SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for separation, and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane. Each membrane was incubated with monoclonal antibody against COX-2 (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, Mich), EGFR (NeoMarkers, Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Fremont, Calif), E-cadherin (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif), p-Akt (Cell Signaling,
Danvers, Mass), and b-actin (Sigma, Saint Louis, Mo).
Blots were washed with phosphate buffer containing
0.05% Tween and incubated with secondary antibodies
conjugated with peroxidase. The signal intensity was then
measured using a chemiluminescent detection system
(Pierce). Autoradiograms of the western blots were scanned
with HP Scanjet (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, Calif) and
bands were quantified using AlphaEaseFC software tool
(Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, Calif).
PGE2 Immunoassay for Quantification
of Prostaglandin E2
On the basis of the basal level of PGE2 from previous studies,24 we tested the effect of treatment on PGE2 level on
H3255 only because this cell line contained the highest level
of PGE2 compared with H1781 and H1650. Gefitinib
(1 nM), erlotinib (10 nM), and genistein (1 lM) were chosen at the lowest concentration possible to see the effect individually and also with both the combinations. The drugs
were added for 4 hours, and the culture medium was collected, measured, and analyzed for PGE2 concentration
according to manufacturer’s protocol using a PGE2 highsensitivity immunoassay kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
Minn). The optical density was measured at 450 nm, and
concentration of PGE2 was calculated from the standard
curve. Results were expressed as PGE2 in pg/106 cells.
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay
for NF-jB Activation
To evaluate the effect of gefitinib and erlotinib on the 3
NSCLC cell lines H3255, H1650, and H1781, the cells
were either untreated or treated with different concentrations of drugs in different cell lines based on their sensitiv2168

ities to gefitinib (5 nM or 10 lM), erlotinib (100 nM or
10 lM), genistein (25 lM), or the combination with the
experiment repeated at least 3 times for 72 hours. The cells
were suspended in 400 lL of ice cold lysis buffer containing
1 M Hepes (pH 7.9), 1 M KCl, 0.5 M ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.1 M ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid
(EGTA), 0.1 M dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mg/mL aprotinin, 1 mg/mL
leupeptin, and 250 mg/mL benzamidine for 15 minutes.
About 12.5 lL of 10% NP-40 was added to every 400 lL
of cell suspension, vortexed, and centrifuged for 1 minute at
4  C. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 25 lL of nuclear extraction buffer containing 1 M Hepes (pH 7.9), 5 M
NaCl, 0.5 M EDTA, 0.1 M EGTA, 0.1 M DTT, 0.1 M
PMSF, 1 mg/mL aprotinin, 1 mg/mL leupeptin, and
250 mg/mL benzamidine on ice for 30 minutes and then
centrifuged at 10,000 g for 20 minutes at 4  C. The supernatant was quantified using BCA Protein assay kit (Pierce).
EMSA was performed using the Odyssey Infrared
Imaging System (LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, Neb) with NFjB IRDye-labeled oligonucleotide (LI-COR). The
DNA-binding reaction was set up using 5 lg of the nuclear extract mixed with oligonucleotide and gel shift
binding buffer consisting of 20% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2,
2.5 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM DTT, 250 mM NaCl, 50 mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.5, and 0.25 mg/mL polydeoxyinosinicdeoxycytidylic acid. The reaction was incubated at room
temperature in the dark for 30 minutes. Two microliters
of 10X Orange Loading Dye was added to each sample,
loaded on the prerun 8% polyacrylamide gel, and run at
30 mA for 1 hour. The gel was scanned using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System. Supershift assay using NFjB p65 antibody was also performed to confirm the specificity of NF-jB DNA-binding activity.
Statistical Methods
Comparisons of treatment outcome were tested for statistical differences by the t test for paired data. Statistical significance was assumed at a P value of <.05.

between genistein and gefitinib/erlotinib in the growth inhibition of all the lung cancer cell lines tested (Fig. 2). The

Induction of Apoptosis by Erlotinib,
Gefitinib, and Genistein and the
Combination
Apoptosis assays were performed in H3255, H1650, and
H1781 cell lines to determine the mechanism of the
observed growth inhibition. Erlotinib and gefitinib
induced apoptosis in all the cell lines, but at much higher
concentrations (100 fold) in H1650 and H1781 cells
compared with H3255 cells (Fig. 3A and B). Genisteininduced apoptosis in each of the cell lines was tested. The
2170

addition of genistein to erlotinib or gefitinib significantly
enhanced apoptosis in all of the cell lines, but to a much
greater extent in the H3255 cell line (Fig. 3A and B) compared with the other 2 cell lines. Because genistein is
known to down-regulate many genes, we therefore used
western blot analysis for assessing the effects of treatments
on protein expression of several genes.

(25 lM), and their combinations (Fig. 4C & D). In
H1650 cells, pAkt level was not detected at baseline,
and therefore no change could be detected with either
single agents or the combinations. In H1781 cells, a significant decrease in the expression of pAkt was observed
with both combinations compared with either of the
single agents. Again, the expression of E-cadherin
remained unchanged in both the cell lines under our experimental conditions. Because we found down-regulation of COX-2, we investigated the levels of the
enzymatic end product of COX-2 under our experimental conditions.

E-cadherin.

Treatment Effects on the Levels of PGE2

Effect of Treatments on NF-jB

PGE2 assay was performed in H3255 cells only because
the basal level of PGE2 was very low in H1781 cells and
undetectable in H1650 cells compared with H3255
cells.24 Assay was performed with gefitinib (1 nM), erlotinib (10 nM), genistein (1 lM), or the combination of
erlotinib with genistein or gefitinib with genistein treatments (Fig. 5A & B). The concentrations of all 3 drugs
chosen for PGE2 assay were very low compared with either growth inhibition assay or protein level to assess the
immediate biological effects and their differences in drug
combinations. We found that the lowest concentration of
all 3 drugs caused a significant decrease in the PGE2 levels
with each of the single agents and both the combinations
in H3255 cells. These results suggest that COX-2 is a
legitimate target of these treatments. To further assess the
mechanism by which genistein enhances the activity of either erlotinib or gefitinib, we evaluated the DNA-binding
activity of NF-jB.

Figure 6A demonstrates the basal level of the DNA-binding activity of NF-jB in H1650, H1781, and H3255 cell
lines. NF-jB activity was high in the H3255 cells and low
in H1650, and almost negligible in H1781 cell lines, and
this correlates with the baseline expression of EGFR,
pAkt, and COX-2 in these cell lines.24 Modulation of
NF-jB activity in response to genistein and EGFR-TKIs
and the combination could not be assessed in the H1781
cell line because the baseline activity of NF-jB was very
low in this cell line. Supershift assay showed that the NFjB band was shifted because of the formation of a bigger
complex after addition of anti-NF-jB p65 antibody (Fig.
6). In H3255 cell line, all the single agents reduced the
levels of NF-jB but significantly greater reduction in the
levels of p65 NF-jB protein was observed with both combinations than any of the single agents (Fig. 6B). A significant reduction in combination compared with single
agent alone could not be detected in H1650 cells (data

baseline expression of NF-jB itself is very low in the
H1650 cell line, as stated earlier.

DISCUSSION
The clinical benefits of EGFR-TKIs are modest in most
NSCLC patients, with only a small proportion of patients
having dramatic antitumor effects. Thus, NSCLCs have
differential sensitivities to EGFR-TKIs. Many tumor factors are currently being evaluated for their ability to predict benefit from EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC patients.
It is accepted that the ability of EGFR-TKIs to
down-regulate Akt in a tumor correlates with their ability
to induce apoptosis and/or growth inhibition in preclinical studies. Akt can be activated in NSCLCs through
EGFR-independent mechanisms such as K-ras activation,
and such independent activation of Akt can be associated
with resistance to EGFR-TKIs. One of the downstream
effects of Akt is activation of NF-jB through I kappa B kinase.25 Because NF-jB regulates the transcription of several genes that regulate growth, angiogenesis, and survival,
continued activation of Akt/NF-jB despite EGFR inhibition by EGFR-TKIs could result in resistance to these
agents.
Previous in vitro studies, including combination
studies, have shown that the growth inhibitory effects of
genistein were linked to the inhibition of PI3K, leading to
the inhibition of Akt, and eventual inhibition of NFjB.22,23,26 We therefore conducted the current experiments to evaluate the effect of the addition of genistein to
EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC cell lines. Because the activity of
EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC differs based on the EGFR mutation status of the tumor, we selected 3 different cell lines
with various EGFR mutation status and various sensitivities to EGFR-TKIs to test our hypothesis. H3255, a cell
line with EGFR mutation27 in exon 21, and H1781 with
wild-type EGFR were studied in 1 of the original reports
regarding EGFR mutations and its influence on the activity of EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC.9 In addition, we also
selected H1650, because it is a cell line with EGFR mutation but is much less sensitive to EGFR-TKIs than
H3255 cells. We have demonstrated that in these 3
different NSCLC cell lines with different sensitivities to
EGFR-TKIs, addition of genistein enhanced the growth
inhibitory and apoptotic effects. The isobologram analysis
2174

demonstrated that these enhanced effects are not just
additive but synergistic. We observed this synergy not
only in EGFR-TKIsensitive NSCLC cell lines, but also
in EGFR-TKIresistant cell lines. These results strongly
suggest that this combination strategy of the addition of
genistein to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC needs to be further
investigated.
To further understand the possible mechanisms of
the enhanced effect with the addition of genistein, we
assessed the effect of each of the EGFR-TKIs and genistein and the combinations on specific protein levels in the
NSCLC cell lines. The combinations had a greater effect
in reducing EGFR and phospho-Akt than either agent
alone. In addition, the combination had a greater effect in
reducing NF-jB levels than any of the single agents. We
also assessed the effect of the individual drugs and the
combinations on COX-2 expression and PGE2, because
NF-jB is known to regulate transcription of the COX-2
gene. Consistent with the observation that the combination significantly reduced NF-jB levels, we found significant reduction in COX-2 expression and PGE2 levels
with both combinations. All these effects were documented in the H3255 cell line, but alterations in all the
above proteins could not be observed in the other 2 cell
lines because of significantly lower expression of some of
these proteins.
Because previous experiments have shown that the
antitumor activity of genistein is related to its ability to
reduce NF-jB levels, it is possible that the enhanced effect
observed with the addition of genistein may be related to
the greater inhibition of NF-jB by the combinations. In
addition, the greatest effect of the combination was
observed in H3255, a cell line with the highest baseline
expression of NF-jB, and greatest inhibition of NF-jB
by the combinations. However, further studies will be
needed to define the true relevance of NF-jB inhibition
in the potentiation of antitumor effects with the addition
of genistein to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC cell lines.
Recent studies have suggested that EMT, characterized by a shift from epithelial phenotype to a highly motile
mesenchymal phenotype, may play a role in resistance to
EGFR-TKIs.12,13,28 EMT phenotype is characterized by
loss of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and overexpression of genes characteristic of mesenchymal phenotype such as vimentin.13 Witta et al demonstrated that
restoring E-cadherin expression could make resistant cells

sensitive to EGFR-TKIs.28 The expression of known
repressors of E-cadherin such as ZEB1 and Snail are regulated by NF-jB.29,30 We therefore speculated that the
enhanced antitumor effect of the addition of genistein
may be through increased expression of E-cadherin in
NSCLC cells through the inhibition of NF-jB. However,
we did not observe any significant increase in E-cadherin
levels with the addition of genistein, suggesting that the
enhanced activity of EGFR-TKIs by genistein could be
because of a complex mechanism involving NF-jB
inactivation, but may not be through increased expression
of E-cadherin.
In conclusion, our results showed that genistein
enhanced the antitumor effects of EGFR-TKIs in 3
NSCLC cell lines with different EGFR gene mutation status and various sensitivities to EGFR-TKIs. We have also
shown that the combination of genistein and EGFR-TKIs
reduces the levels of NF-jB. We hypothesize that the
enhanced antitumor activity observed with the combination of genistein and EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC cell lines
may be related to greater inhibition of NF-jB. Further
studies to better define the correlation between the inhibition of NF-jB and the enhanced antitumor effect with
the addition of genistein to EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC cell
lines are required.
