Abstract
Aurora A kinase (AURKA) is overexpressed in 96% of human cancers and is considered an independent
marker of poor prognosis. While the majority of tumors have elevated levels of AURKA protein, few have
AURKA gene ampliﬁcation, implying that posttranscriptional mechanisms regulating AURKA protein levels
are signiﬁcant. Here, we show that NEDD9, a known activator of AURKA, is directly involved in AURKA
stability. Analysis of a comprehensive breast cancer tissue microarray revealed a tight correlation between
the expression of both proteins, signiﬁcantly corresponding with increased prognostic value. A decrease in
AURKA, concomitant with increased ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation, occurs due to
depletion or knockout of NEDD9. Reexpression of wild-type NEDD9 was sufﬁcient to rescue the observed
phenomenon. Binding of NEDD9 to AURKA is critical for AURKA stabilization, as mutation of S296E was
sufﬁcient to disrupt binding and led to reduced AURKA protein levels. NEDD9 confers AURKA stability by
limiting the binding of the cdh1–substrate recognition subunit of APC/C ubiquitin ligase to AURKA.
Depletion of NEDD9 in tumor cells increases sensitivity to AURKA inhibitors. Combination therapy with
NEDD9 short hairpin RNAs and AURKA inhibitors impairs tumor growth and distant metastasis in mice
harboring xenografts of breast tumors. Collectively, our ﬁndings provide rationale for the use of AURKA
inhibitors in treatment of metastatic tumors and predict the sensitivity of the patients to AURKA inhibitors
based on NEDD9 expression. Cancer Res; 73(10); 3168–80. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
The serine/threonine kinase, AURKA, is a proto-oncoprotein
that is overexpressed in most cancers (1–3). High AURKA
expression is strongly associated with decreased survival and
is an independent prognostic marker (4). AURKA overexpression disrupts the spindle checkpoint activated by paclitaxel or
nocodazole, inducing resistance to these compounds (5).
Inhibition or depletion of AURKA protein may therefore
improve the survival of patients resistant to paclitaxel (5).
While 94% of the primary invasive mammary carcinomas have
elevated AURKA protein levels (6), only 13.6% show AURKA
gene ampliﬁcation (1, 3). Thus, posttranscriptional mechanisms of AURKA stabilization are important in breast cancer.

AURKA is polyubiquitinated by the anaphase-promoting
complex/cyclosome (APC/C) complex and targeted for degradation by the proteasome (7). APC/C-dependent degradation of AURKA requires cdh1, which acts as a substrate
recognition subunit for a number of mitotic proteins, including
Plk1 and cyclin B. Overexpression of cdh1 reduces AURKA
levels (8), whereas cdh1 knockdown or mutation of the AURKA
cdh1–binding site results in elevated AURKA expression (7–9).
AURKA is ubiquitinated through the recognition of a carboxylterminal D-box (destruction box) and an amino-terminal Abox, speciﬁc for the destruction of AURKA (10, 11). Phosphorylation of AURKA on Ser51 in the A-box inhibits cdh1-APC/C–
mediated ubiquitination and consequent AURKA degradation
(9).
Cancer cells express high levels of AURKA independently of a
cell cycle, which suggests that there are additional mechanisms
of AURKA stabilization. Recently, a number of proteins were
documented to be involved in the regulation of AURKA stability either by direct deubiquitination of AURKA (12) or
through interference with AURKA ubiquitination by APC/C
(PUM2, TPX2, LIMK2; refs. 13–15.)
NEDD9 is a member of metastatic gene signature identiﬁed in breast adenocarcinomas and melanomas (16–18).

NEDD9 Stabilizes AURKA

of AURKA by NEDD9 in interphase is tightly controlled by a
limited amount of NEDD9 in cytoplasm. Overexpression of
NEDD9 leads to the activation of AURKA resulting in centrosomal ampliﬁcation and aberrant mitosis (19). NEDD9
undergoes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation by
APC/C. Like typical APC/C substrates, NEDD9 has D-box
motifs and cdh1 binds to a D-box located within the carboxyl-terminal domain (20, 21).
The strong link between increased AURKA expression and
cancer progression has stimulated development of AURKA
inhibitors for cancer therapy. PHA-680632 (22, 23), MLN8054,
and MLN8237 (24, 25) are potent small-molecule inhibitors of
AURKA activity. These compounds have signiﬁcant antitumor
activity in various animal tumor models with favorable pharmacokinetics (23). However, clinical trials with MLN8054 as a
single agent failed to show tumor growth inhibition (25, 26). In
the present study, using human breast cell lines and xenografts,
we have identiﬁed NEDD9 as a critical regulator of AURKA
protein stability and sensitivity to AURKA inhibitors. Depletion
of NEDD9 via short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) decreases AURKA
protein, sensitizes tumor cells to AURKA inhibitors, and eliminates metastasis in xenograft models of breast cancer. Combination therapy using NEDD9 shRNAs and AURKA inhibitors
might prove to be an effective treatment strategy for solid
tumors with NEDD9 overexpression.

Materials and Methods
Plasmids and reagents
shRNAs, siRNAs against human NEDD9, AURKA, and control expressed in pGIPZ or in doxycycline-inducible pTRIPZ
vectors (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). Lentiviral particles were
prepared as previously described (26). Wild-type, Ser296Ala-A,
S296/298-AA, Ser296Glu-E, and S296/298-EE cDNAs of murine
NEDD9 were subcloned into pLUTZ lentiviral vector under
doxycycline-inducible promoter. pcDNA3.1-myc-Ubiquitin
and pcDNA3.1-HA-NEDD9 were used for ubiquitination
studies. Induction of shRNA or cDNA was done by addition
of 1 mg/mL doxycyline.
Cell lines and culture conditions
The cell lines MDA-MB-231, BT-549, BT-20, ZR-75-1, MCF7,
and MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H2LN (MDA-MB-231LN) expressing
luciferase (Caliper Life Sciences) were purchased and authenticated by American Type Culture Collection. After infection
(or transfection) of shRNAs (or siRNAs), cells were selected
for puromycin resistance and tested by Western blotting.
Protein stability studies
Approximately 2 107 cells were plated; 12 hours later, fresh
medium containing cycloheximide (50 mg/mL) or MG132 (10
mmol/L) was added for 12 hours. At indicated time intervals,
cells were lysed in protein Triton-based cell lysis buffer (19)
with ubiquitin aldehyde (1–2 mmol/L), protease inhibitors
(Sigma).
Cell-cycle analysis by ﬂow cytometry
The ﬂuorescence-activated cell-sorting (FACS) analysis was
done according to a previously published protocol (19). Cell-

cycle distribution was analyzed by FACSCalibur equipped with
Cell Quest software.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Quantitative PCR (qPCR: ref. 27) was carried out in an ABI
7500 Real-Time PCR Cycler and analyzed using Applied Biosystems SDS software.
Immunohistochemical analysis
High-density breast cancer tissue microarrays BR2082
(Supplementary Table S1) were collected with full donor
consent. Immunohistochemical (IHC) procedures were
done according to the manufacturer's recommendations
(US Biomax Inc.) in duplicates. Manual scoring of staining
intensity [negative (0), weak (1þ), moderate (2þ), or strong
(3þ)], as well as location and cell types was completed by
an independent pathologist from US Biomax, Inc. Each
core was scanned by the Aperio Scanning System at 20.
The total number of positive cells and the intensity of
anti-NEDD9 staining were computed by Aperio ImageScope10.1 software based on the digital images taken from
each core.
Western blot procedure and antibodies
Western blotting procedures were previously described
(26). Primary antibodies included anti-NEDD9 monoclonal
antibody (mAb; 2G9; ref. 19), anti-NEDD9 (p55, custom
made using NEDD9 1–394 aa as an antigen), anti-b-actin
mAb, or anti-GAPDH (Sigma); anti-AURKA (BD Biosciences);
anti-AURKA (AurA-N, custom made using 1–126 aa
N-terminal fragment of AURKA), anti-phospho-T288 Aurora
A (Cell Signaling); and anti-histone H3, and anti-phosphoSer10 histone H3 and anti-ubiquitin (Millipore, BD
Biosciences). Blots were developed by the HyGLO HRP
Detection Reagent (Denville Scientiﬁc, Inc.). Bands were
digitized and quantiﬁed using a digital electrophoresis documentation and image analysis system (G-box, Syngene
Corp.).
Protein expression, GST pull-down, and
immunoprecipitation
In vitro pull-down and immunoprecipitation protocols were
previously published (19, 26). Immunoprecipitation samples
were incubated with anti-AURKA (AurA-N) or anti-NEDD9
(p55), immobilized on the A/G-protein Sepharose or 4B-Glutathione agarose for GST pull-down (G&E Healthcare Life
Sciences) at 4 C, washed and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Histagged cdh1 protein (Novus International, Inc.), 50 ng of
recombinant AURKA and GST-HEF1 in AURKA buffer were
used in the cdh1 titration pull-down.
Animal studies
NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) immunodeﬁcient
mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (stock
5557). Animals were housed in the WVU Animal Facility
(Morgantown, WV) under pathogen-free conditions; protocol
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Primary tumor and organs with metastases were collected,

processed, and analyzed by the WVU Department of Pathology
Tissue Bank Core Facility.
Animal bioluminescence imaging
Mice were injected with luciferase-expressing MDA-MB231LN cells and imaged weekly for quantitative evaluation of
tumor growth and dissemination. About 150 mg/kg D-luciferin
(Caliper Life Sciences) was injected into the peritoneum.
Images were obtained using the IVIS Lumina-II Imaging
System and Living Image-4.0 software.
1. Mammary fat pad injections: For animal studies, cells
were grown, trypsinized, resuspended in DPBS (1  107
cells/mL), and 0.1 mL was injected into the fourth
inguinal mammary gland of female mice 6 to 8 weeks of
age and followed by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) up to
6 weeks.
2. Tail vein injections: Males were intravenously injected
with 1  105 cells and followed by BLI once a week for 2 to
3 weeks total. Total radiance of lungs was calculated at
each time point in control and treated animals. Lungs
were imaged, ﬁxed in formalin at the end point of study,
and analyzed for number and size of metastases by a
pathologist.
Tumor volume measurement
Tumor size was assessed by Vevo2100 Micro-Ultrasound
System. A 40 or 50 mHz transducer was used, depending on the
tumor size, and a 3-dimensional image (3D) was acquired with
0.051 mm between images. Using the integrated software, the
images were reconstructed to create a 3D image of the tumor.
AURKA inhibitors application
Cell line studies. Cells were treated with MLN8054 (0–100
nmol/L) or PHA-680632 (0–400 nmol/L) inhibitors (Selleckchem) for 2 to 12 hours, disrupted in protein Triton-based cell
lysis buffer (19) processed for Western blotting or immunoﬂuorescence staining.
Xenograft studies. Compound administration began (i)
when primary tumors reached 150 to 200 mm3 in female mice
or (ii) 24 hours postintravenous injection of tumor cells in male
mice. MLN8237 is an improved analog of MLN8054 compound
with increased stability suitable for in vivo studies. MLN8237
was dissolved in 10% 2-hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin, 1% sodium bicarbonate in water. About 20 mg/kg/dose was administered via oral gavage twice daily for 4 days/week for 2 weeks.
MLN8237 was tested against a placebo control consisting of
drug vehicle.
Statistical analysis
Unpaired t test, nonlinear regression, or 1- or 2-way ANOVA
with Tukey's multiple comparisons were used for statistical
analysis of the results. Experimental values were reported as
SEM. Differences in mean values were considered signiﬁcant at
P < 0.05. Rates of tumor growth were established by linear
regression of the bioluminescence data with time and cohort
membership as covariates. Statistical calculations were conducted using the GraphPad InStat software package.

Results
Increased NEDD9 expression tightly correlates with
expression of AURKA protein in breast cancer
AURKA and NEDD9 are independently overexpressed in
many human cancers (1–3, 16–18). We have previously shown
that NEDD9 binds to and activates AURKA in cancer cells (19),
and expression of AURKA alone was found to be an independent prognostic marker of poor survival. To determine whether
the expression of both proteins could facilitate the diagnosis of
certain types or stages of breast cancer, we conducted IHC
staining for NEDD9 and AURKA in 120 cases of breast cancer.
Cases screened from a tissue microarray consisted of 4 groups
of progressive disease stages: (i) normal tissue, (ii) intraductal
carcinoma (IC), (iii) invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), and (iv)
metastatic IDC (MIDC; Supplementary Table S1). Representative images of IHC staining for each group are shown in Fig.
1A. Statistical analysis of staining intensity suggests that
NEDD9 and AURKA expression positively correlate. The lowest
expression and intensity of either protein was found in normal
tissue, whereas a 10- to 20-fold increase in expression was
observed in tumor samples (Fig. 1B). Signiﬁcant correlation
between NEDD9 and AURKA expression was noted for all 4
evaluated tissue types (Fig. 1C). The Spearman correlation
coefﬁcients for the normal, IC, IDC, and MIDC groups are 0.85,
0.67, 0.63, and 0.59, respectively, indicating a positive correlation (Fig. 1C). A random forest ﬁt of NEDD9 and AURKA
positivity staining, which achieved an out-of-bag error rate of
0.508, indicates that by using NEDD9 and AURKA positivity
scores, one can double the predictive power over chance (Fig.
1D). To deﬁne the molecular mechanisms underlying NEDD9
and AURKA correlative expression proﬁles, we used a panel of
human breast cancer cell lines where the levels of NEDD9 can
be manipulated and controlled.
Depletion of NEDD9 leads to dramatic decrease of
AURKA protein in cells lines and animal models
The expression proﬁles of AURKA and NEDD9 in a panel of
human breast cancer cell lines followed a pattern similar to
that observed in the tissue microarray analysis. Invasive MDAMB-231 (or highly invasive lymph node–derived MDA-MB231LN), MDA-MB-453, and ZR-75-1 cell lines had the highest
levels of expression of NEDD9 and AURKA, followed by BT-549,
and noninvasive MCF7 and BT-20 lines (Fig. 2A). We next
evaluated AURKA protein levels in mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts derived from NEDD9 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT)
animals. AURKA expression levels were reduced in KO cells
compared with WT cells (Fig. 2B). Similar results were
obtained by IHC analysis of tissue sections (Fig. 2C), suggesting
that maximal expression of AURKA is dependent on NEDD9.
Depletion of NEDD9 by 2 different shRNAs or siRNAs
reduced the levels of AURKA protein by 60% to 80% (Fig.
2D; Supplementary Fig. S1A). To determine whether the
reduced levels of AURKA were due to transcriptional mechanisms or nonspeciﬁc siRNA depletion, we carried out qRT-PCR
analysis for NEDD9 and AURKA. The NEDD9-targeting siRNAs
did not affect the levels of AURKA mRNA (Supplementary Fig.
S1B), indicating that NEDD9 regulates AURKA at the protein
level. Moreover, we were able to restore AURKA protein levels

in shNEDD9 cells via reexpression of doxycycline-inducible
WT-NEDD9 cDNA (Fig. 2E).
Protein levels of NEDD9 and AURKA are tightly regulated
during the cell cycle (28); therefore, we examined the effects of
NEDD9 depletion on the cell cycle. FACS analysis of cells
treated with siRNA targeting NEDD9 did not show signiﬁcant
difference in cell-cycle distribution when compared with siCon
(Supplementary Fig. S1C). These results indicate that the
decrease in AURKA protein level is NEDD9-dependent and is
posttranscriptionally regulated.

NEDD9 regulates the stability of AURKA
To further evaluate how NEDD9 governs AURKA expression,
we examined AURKA levels in shCon- and shNEDD9-MDAMB-231LN cells treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor
cycloheximide. Cycloheximide treatment led to an abrupt
decrease in the amount of AURKA in shNEDD9 cells during
the ﬁrst 3 hours (Fig. 3A). shCon cells had elevated AURKA
levels for 6 hours and followed NEDD9 protein decay dynamics
(Fig. 3A). The half-life of AURKA was 6 and 3 hours in shCon
and shNEDD9, respectively (Fig. 3B). The delayed decrease in

AURKA protein levels in control cells compared with shNEDD9
indicates that AURKA protein stability is dependent on
NEDD9.
Decreased AURKA protein in NEDD9-deﬁcient cells is
caused by enhanced proteasome-dependent degradation
NEDD9 and AURKA undergo ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in a cell-cycle–dependent manner (9, 20). To
test whether the decrease in AURKA protein levels is associated
with increased proteasome-based degradation, cell lines with
depleted NEDD9 were treated with the proteasome inhibitor
MG132 (Fig. 3C). Inhibition of proteasomal activity restored
levels of AURKA in shNEDD9 cells to that of control cells (Fig.
3C and D), suggesting that NEDD9 protects AURKA from
ubiquitination- and proteasome-dependent degradation. To
directly test this, AURKA was immunoprecipitated from
shNEDD9 and control cells and analyzed by immunoblotting

with anti-AURKA and antiubiquitin antibodies. Depletion of
NEDD9 increased the amount of ubiquitinated AURKA (Fig. 3E
and F). Similar results were obtained with original MDA-MB231 cells. Moreover, reexpression of wild-type NEDD9 was able
to rescue this phenotype and decrease ubiquitination of
AURKA (Supplementary Fig. S1E and S1F).
NEDD9-dependent decrease in AURKA ubiquitination could
be caused by steric hindrance of bound NEDD9 or by titration
of ubiquitination machinery components, as both proteins use
the APC/C–cdh1 complex (8, 20). To distinguish between these
2 possibilities, the levels of other APC/C–cdh1 targets, including Plk1 and Cdk1, in shNEDD9 cells were evaluated by
immunoblotting. No difference in Plk1 and Cdk1 expression
was detected between shNEDD9 and controls cells (Supplementary Fig. S1D), indicating that NEDD9 speciﬁcally targets
AURKA and does not affect stability of other APC/C–cdh1
substrates. We have previously shown that NEDD9 binds to the

N-terminal domain of AURKA containing the A-box motif (19),
which is required for cdh1 binding and ubiquitination by
APC/C (7, 8). To test this hypothesis, we used recombinant
NEDD9, cdh1, and AURKA in in vitro GST pull-down assay and
examined whether the presence of NEDD9 imposes its inhibitory action on cdh1 directly. We conﬁrmed that NEDD9 was
able to bind AURKA in vitro in the presence of excess cdh1 and
titrated cdh1 from the complex with AURKA in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3G and H). Thus, the presence of
NEDD9 potentially increases AURKA protein levels by protecting AURKA from binding cdh1 resulting in reduced AURKA
ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation.
NEDD9 binding to AURKA is necessary for protein
stabilization
Phosphorylation of NEDD9 at S296 and S298 by AURKA
impedes formation of the NEDD9/AURKA complex (19). To
determine the impact of NEDD9 binding on AURKA protein
levels, individual and dual phosphorylation null S296A-(A),
S296A/S298A-(AA) and mimetic S296E-(E), S296E/S298E-(EE)
forms of NEDD9 were generated. Indicated mutants were
transfected in HEK293T cells followed by immunoprecipitation of AURKA (Fig. 4A). Immunoprecipitation analysis
showed a reduction in binding to AURKA by the NEDD9
phosphomimetic (E, EE) mutants, whereas phosphorylation
null (A, AA) NEDD9 mutants showed increase in AURKA
binding (Fig. 4A and B), in agreement with our previously
published observations (19). The increase in binding by phosphorylation-null mutants in this setting is expected because of
overexpression of NEDD9 in HEK293T cells and inability of
AURKA/NEDD9-AA complex to dissociate. To test the ability of
these mutants to rescue the levels of AURKA in shNEDD9 cells,
the 2 NEDD9 mutants (AA, EE) were overexpressed in an
inducible manner and AURKA levels were measured by Western blotting (Fig. 4C and D). Reexpression of the AA mutant
was sufﬁcient to restore the levels of AURKA protein, meanwhile, the EE mutant failed to restore the levels of AURKA to
control levels due to its inability to bind AURKA. Therefore,
binding of NEDD9 to AURKA is necessary to stabilize AURKA.
NEDD9 binding to AURKA decreases the efﬁcacy of
AURKA inhibitors in vitro and in in vivo xenografts
Because of the structural proximity of the ATP-binding
pocket to the NEDD9-binding domain on AURKA (23), we
hypothesized that NEDD9-AURKA binding could potentially
interfere with binding of AURKA inhibitors, in addition to
preventing cdh1 binding. MLN8054 and PHA-680632 are ATPcompetitive AURKA inhibitors that are currently in phase II
clinical trials that have shown some efﬁcacy against hematopoietic malignancies but have minimal effects against solid
tumors (29–31). To evaluate the impact of NEDD9 expression
on therapeutic outcome, NEDD9 was knocked down in breast
cancer cell lines with high NEDD9 expression before treatment
with PHA-680632 or MLN8054. NEDD9 depletion increased the
efﬁcacy of both inhibitors (Fig. 5A), decreasing the IC50 of PHA680632 from 150 nmol/L in control cells to 50 to 100 nmol/L in
shNEDD9 cells (Fig. 5B), as determined by the amount of active
phT288-AURKA. Similar results were obtained with MLN8054,

3174

Cancer Res; 73(10) May 15, 2013

where the IC50 value decreased from 200 nmol/L (shCon) to 20
nmol/L (shNEDD9; Fig. 5C and D). Inhibition of AURKA
function was further conﬁrmed by analysis of histone H3
phosphorylation in treated shCon and shNEDD9 cells. Inhibition of AURKA leads to accumulation of cells in mitosis
characterized by phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 (Fig.
5B and D and Supplementary Fig. S2E). The concentration of
PHA-680632 was limited to 400 nmol/L to avoid targeting
AURKB, which might lead to decrease in phosphorylation of
histone H3.
NEDD9 depletion alone or in combination with AURKA
inhibitors reduces tumor burden and lung metastasis
To examine the validity of our ﬁndings in in vivo xenograft
models of human breast cancer, we used MDA-MB-231LN cells
and shRNAs targeting NEDD9 or control. Tumor cells were
injected into the mammary fat pad of NSG female mice and the
tumor growth was assessed using BLI (Fig. 6A and B). The
original MDA-MB-231LN cell line was tested and showed
similar NEDD9 expression, tumor growth, and metastasis
kinetics when compared with MDA-MB-231LN-shCon cells
(Fig. 6A and B and Supplementary Fig. S1F). On the basis of
these results, we have concluded that the MDA-MB-231LNshCon cell line is a proper control and we used it in the
subsequent experiments. Depletion of NEDD9 alone reduced
tumor burden by 15% to 20% (Fig. 6B) and reduced the number
of metastases in lungs by 25% to 50% (Fig. 6D and E shCon-V,
shN2-V and Supplementary Fig. S2A).
Next, we combined shNEDD9 and AURKA inhibitor
(MLN8237, a more stable analog of MLN8054) to test whether the combination will increase the efﬁcacy of MLN8237
against primary tumor and metastasis (Fig. 6C–E). Treatment was initiated when primary tumor volume reached 150
to 200 mm3, based on ultrasound measurements in each
cohort (30). Representative images and quantiﬁcation of
tumor volume is shown in Supplementary Fig. S2B and
S2C. Difference in the rates of tumor growth among the 4
groups was assessed by BLI and pathology measurements
using linear regression analysis with time, cell line, and
treatment as covariates. Application of MLN8237 alone did
not lead to a decrease in primary tumor growth, but in
combination with shNEDD9, efﬁcacy was improved 2-fold
(Fig. 6C). Surprisingly, treatment with MLN8237 alone signiﬁcantly decreased the number of lung metastases with a 2fold greater response in shNEDD9-expressing cells (Fig. 6D
and E; Supplementary Fig. S2D).
Next, we used intravenous injection of breast cancer cells in
NSG male mice to determine the impact of AURKA inhibitor
on colonization by circulating tumor cells. On the basis of BLI
data (Fig. 7A–C) and study endpoint pathology reports on
dissected lungs (Supplementary Fig. S2F), shNEDD9-expressing cells were extremely sensitive to MLN8237 and were not
capable of initiating tumor growth in lungs when compared
with vehicle-treated cells. In summary, depletion of NEDD9
sensitizes human xenografted tumors and circulating tumor
cells to AURKA inhibitors and eliminates metastasis to
the lungs. Collectively, our data suggest a model (Fig. 7D)
in which overexpression of NEDD9 renders AURKA less

Our data indicate that NEDD9 expression levels correlate
positively with oncogenic AURKA expression and activation.
Both proteins were correlated with pathologic parameters in
human breast cancer cell lines and breast cancer patient

cancer stage invasiveness is possible when screening for
expression of both proteins.

AURKA inhibitors have recently entered phase II clinical
trials for cancer treatment. However, the best response
achieved in advanced tumors is disease stabilization, as
tumor regression has not been reported (29–32). The knowledge of the molecular factors that inﬂuence AURKA stability
and, therefore, sensitivity and resistance to AURKA inhibitors remains limited. With a few exceptions, such as TPX2
and PUM2 (13, 14), the role of AURKA activators in the
stability of AURKA and their impact on sensitivity to AURKA
inhibitors is unknown.
We show here that NEDD9 is a critical component in AURKA
activation and stability. Furthermore, the molecular mechanism by which NEDD9/AURKA signaling functions to increase
breast tumor cell resistance to AURKA inhibitors has been
elucidated. Overexpression of NEDD9 in breast cancer cells
prevents proteolytic degradation of AURKA and results in
upregulation of AURKA protein level. AURKA activation cor-

relates with protein stabilization, which in turn directly
depends upon APC/C complex and its substrate recognition
subunit, cdh1. Direct binding of NEDD9 to AURKA hampers
the ability of the APC/C complex to ubiquitinate AURKA by
preventing cdh1 binding. A NEDD9-dependent increase in
AURKA protein and activity is critical for G2–M transition.
Interestingly, the majority of proteins activating and/or stabilizing AURKA reside in the nucleus (Bora, TPX2, Ajuba, etc.)
or require prior modiﬁcations (TPX2/AURKA binding is stimulated by the GTPase Ran) including phosphorylation by
AURKA for binding (33–36). Nevertheless, a NEDD9-driven
increase in the total amount of AURKA would be less noticeable in mitosis due to the inactivity of cdh1 (8). The excess of
NEDD9 protein might promote the binding of known AURKA
partners such as Ajuba, TPX2, and Bora (33, 34) leading to
increased loading of AURKA on microtubules and Plk1 activity
(37) and cancer progression. Direct binding of NEDD9 at the N-

the ability AURKA inhibitors to access ATP packet.

NEDD9 Stabilizes AURKA

terminal domain decreases the efﬁcacy of AURKA inhibitors
in cell culture and in mammary tumor xenografts. Deletion
or mutation of NEDD9 dramatically decreases AURKA protein level and kinase activity. Phosphorylation of NEDD9 by
AURKA at Ser296 serves as a negative feedback loop to
regulate the levels of active AURKA. The abundance of
NEDD9 in epithelial cancers and dephosphorylation by PP2A
(21) creates a constant supply of unphosphorylated NEDD9
that would stabilize and activate AURKA. We found that
depletion of NEDD9 reduces tumor cell proliferation and
lung metastases of orthotopic human tumor xenografts.
Finally, we have established that treatment with AURKA
inhibitors is particularly efﬁcient against metastasis. In
combination with shNEDD9 RNAs, MLN8237 abolishes lung
metastases from orthotopic xenograft models as well as in
lung colonization assays. No signiﬁcant changes in animal
weight and no apparent toxicity were noticed, suggesting a
favorable toxicity proﬁle.
The correlation of AURKA and NEDD9 expression in cancer
patient biopsies could be critical for diagnostic purposes. It
could potentially be used to predict the sensitivity of these
patients to AURKA inhibitors. In addition, our results advocate
the development and investigation of new NEDD9-targeting
compounds as a novel therapeutic strategy against metastatic
breast cancer.
