ABSTRACT
Chemoresistance to anticancer drugs substantially reduces survival in epithelial
ovarian carcinoma (EOC). Here, microarray analysis showed that collagen type XI
alpha 1 (COL11A1) is a chemotherapy response-associated gene. Chemoresistant
cells expressed higher COL11A1 and c/EBPβ than chemosensitive cells. COL11A1
or c/EBPβ downregulation suppressed chemoresistance, whereas COL11A1
overexpression  attenuated sensitivity to cisplatin and paclitaxel.The c/EBPβ
binding site in the COL11A1 promoter was identified as the major determinant of
cisplatin- and paclitaxel-induced COL11A1 expression. Immunoprecipitation and
immunofluorescence showed that in resistant cells, Akt and PDK1 were highly
expressed and that anticancer drugs enhanced binding activity between COL11A1
and PDK1 binding and attenuated PDK1 ubiquitination and degradation. Conversely,
chemosensitive cells showed decreased activity of COL11A1 binding to PDK1 and
increased PDK1 ubiquitination, which were reversed by COL11A1 overexpression.
Analysis of 104 EOC patients showed that high COL11A1 mRNA levels are significantly
associated with poor chemoresponse and clinical outcome.

response to chemotherapy. Among the 30 upregulated genes
selected (Table 1), collagen type XI alpha 1 (COL11A1) was
the most highly elevated. COL11A1 belongs to the collagen
family, which is a major component of the interstitial
extracellular matrix. COL11A1 overexpression has been
shown to be associated with progression in several cancers,
including ovarian cancer [7–11]. Our previous findings also
identified COL11A1 as a disease progression-associated
gene that is linked to EOC recurrence and poor survival [7].
In addition, COL11A1 is preferentially elevated in cisplatinresistant ovarian cancer cells [12, 13]. However, the
mechanisms by which COL11A1 increases chemoresistance
are poorly understood. In this study, the molecular
mechanisms underlying COL11A1-increased cancer drug
resistance were elucidated, providing an understanding of
the mode of action.

INTRODUCTION
Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) is the most
lethal gynaecologic malignancy [1]. Despite cytoreductive
surgery followed by combination cisplatin and paclitaxel
chemotherapy, many EOC patients eventually relapse,
develop chemoresistant tumours, and die from the disease
[2]. Therefore, it is important to identify markers that
predict responsiveness to chemotherapy, which may allow
for the development of therapeutic biomarkers aimed at
overcoming chemoresistance.
Several studies have used gene microarrays to identify
distinct genes expressed in chemoresistant EOC patients
[3–6]. In this study, we analysed the expression profiles
of 60 epithelial ovarian cancer tissue samples obtained at
first cytoreductive surgery to identify genes associated with

with various concentrations of cisplatin or paclitaxel for 72 h, and then cell sensitivity to anticancer drugs was measured by the MTT assay.

our expression data and identified COL11A1 as the most
highly elevated transcript linked to chemoresistance, with
an 8-fold increase compared to that of the control. For
four of the five genes, we found a significant difference
in gene expression levels between the chemosensitive and
chemoresistant cell line pairs (Fig. 1B). Therefore, we
selected COL11A1 for further experimental analysis.

COL11A1 is preferentially activated by anticancer drugs,
especially in cells with pre-existing chemoresistance.
To test this, A2780 and A2780CP70 cells were treated
with cisplatin, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, or pegylated
liposomal doxorubicin (LipoDox®). Our data show that
in A2780CP70 cells, COL11A1 was induced by both
cisplatin and paclitaxel in a dose- (Fig. 1C) and timedependent (Fig. 1D) manner. In contrast, COL11A1
expression was not induced by gemcitabine or LipoDox®
treatment (Supplementary Fig.1A). In addition, COL11A1
expression levels in A2780 cells were basically not
activated by these four drugs (Fig. 1C, 1D, and
Supplementary Fig. 1A).
To examine whether COL11A1 confers
resistance to anticancer drugs, a small interfering

RNA specific for the COL11A1 gene (shCOL11A1)
was introduced into A2780CP70 cells, and a COL11A1
cDNA plasmid was introduced into COL11A1-low
expressing A2780 cells to induce its overexpression.
As expected, COL11A1 expression decreased in
COL11A1-knockdown A2780CP70 cells and increased
in COL11A1-overexpressing A2780 cells. The halfmaximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of cisplatin
and paclitaxel was lower in COL11A1-knockdown
A2780CP70 cells than in shcontrol cells. Conversely, the
sensitivity of COL11A1-overexpressing A2780 cells to
cisplatin and paclitaxel was decreased compared to that
of vector control cells (VC) (Fig. 1E). The gemcitabine
and LipoDox® IC50 values were not changed
by COL11A1 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 1B).
Collectively, these data demonstrate that COL11A1 is
involved in the regulation of cisplatin and paclitaxel
responsiveness in chemoresistant A2780CP70 cells but
not in chemosensitive A2780 cells.

sites were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. The
activity of the COL11A1 promoter reporter plasmids
containing p300 or c-Rel binding site mutations was
enhanced by cisplatin and paclitaxel, while the activity of
reporter plasmids carrying a c/EBPβ binding site mutation
was nearly unchanged (Fig. 2C). ChIP analysis showed
that c/EBPβ binding to the COL11A1 promoter region was
stimulated by cisplatin and paclitaxel in A2780CP70 cells
but not in A2780 cells (Fig. 2D). Silencing of EBPβ by shc/
EBPβ suppressed the increase in COL11A1 expression
induced by cisplatin and paclitaxel and increased sensitivity
to cisplatin and paclitaxel in A2780CP70 cells (Fig. 2E).
These results indicated that the c/EBPβ binding site in the
COL11A1 promoter is the major determinant of COL11A1
activation by anticancer drugs in chemoresistant ovarian
cancer cells.
c/EBPβ expression has been shown to be increased
by activation of the Akt pathway [14]. To examine the
involvement of Akt signalling, A2780CP70 cells were treated
with cisplatin or paclitaxel plus the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002. We found that the
expression levels of p-Akt, c/EBPβ, and COL11A1 were
enhanced by cisplatin and paclitaxel (Fig.3A) and that this
elevated expression was inhibited by LY294002 (Fig.3B).
Then, the COL11A1–541/–203 promoter constructs were
transiently transfected into A2780CP70 cells, which were
then treated with cisplatin or paclitaxel along with various
signalling pathway inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 3C, the
increase in luciferase activity induced by cisplatin or
paclitaxel in the COL11A1–541/–203 promoter fragmenttransfected cells was not decreased by inhibitors of
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK; PD98059), p38
(SB203580), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK; SP600125),
or TGF-β1 (Supplementary Fig. 2); however, the increase
was almost completely inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor
LY294002. ChIP analysis showed that c/EBPβ binding to
the COL11A1 promoter region was stimulated by cisplatin
and paclitaxel and inhibited by LY294002 (Fig. 3D).
Sensitivity of COL11A1-overexpressing A2780 cells
to cisplatin and paclitaxel also increased after treatment
with LY294002 (Fig. 3E). These results indicated that the
Akt signalling pathway is involved in COL11A1-induced
chemoresistance of ovarian cancer cells, which occurs
through activation of c/EBPβ.

The Akt/c/EBPβ signalling pathway is involved
in cisplatin- and paclitaxel-induced COL11A1
upregulation in chemoresistant ovarian
cancer  cells
To further explore the mechanism by which the
anticancer drugs cisplatin and paclitaxel increase COL11A1
transcription, a fragment spanning positions -541 to -1
relative to the COL11A1 transcription start site was amplified
by PCR, sequenced, and cloned into a luciferase reporter
plasmid. Then, a series of COL11A1 promoter constructs
containing various deletions (as shown in Fig. 2A) were
constructed and transiently transfected individually into
A2780 and A2780CP70 cells. These cells were then
treated with anticancer drugs for 8 h. The data showed
that COL11A1 promoter activity was higher in cisplatinresistant A2780CP70 cells than in cisplatin-naive A2780
cells (Fig. 2A). In addition, the luciferase activity of the
transfectants containing the COL11A1−541/−203 promoter
fragment was significantly enhanced by both cisplatin and
paclitaxel in a dose-dependent manner. The luciferase
activity of the COL11A1–541/+1 promoter fragment was
weakly induced by both cisplatin and paclitaxel treatment,
while that of the COL11A1–202/+1 promoter fragment
was relatively unaltered by the treatments (Fig. 2B).
In contrast, the activity of the COL11A1 promoter was
not stimulated by either gemcitabine or LipoDox®
treatment (Supplementary Fig. 1C). These results indicate
that the region between−541 and−203 of the COL11A1
promoter is important for transcriptional regulation
by cisplatin and paclitaxel.

Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) has been
identified as the activator of Akt [15–17], and the kinase
domain of PDK1 is ubiquitinated [18]. We then examined
the expression of PDK1, p-Akt, and c/EBPβ and found

that their expression was inhibited in shCOL11A1 cells
(Fig. 4A). Therefore, we hypothesized that PDK1 protein
stability could be enhanced by COL11A1. A2780CP70
cells transfected with shCOL11A1 or shcontrol were
treated with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein
synthesis. Western blotting showed that the half-life of
PDK1 protein was significantly reduced in shCOL11A1transfected cells compared to that in shcontrol-transfected
cells (Fig. 4B, upper panel). Because PDK1 protein
stability is reduced in shCOL11A1 cells, we next
investigated the major route of PDK1 degradation, i.e.,
the proteasome, lysosome, or protease protein-degradation
pathway. Fig. 4B shows that more PDK1 protein was
present following treatment with a specific inhibitor of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the proteasome pathway (MG132), whereas no significant
change in PDK1 protein levels was observed after
treatment with a lysosome inhibitor (NH4Cl) or protease
inhibitor (PI). In addition, after MG132 treatment, PDK1
was degraded faster in shCOL11A1 cells than in shcontrol
cells (Fig. 4B, lower panel). Therefore, the proteasome
pathway is the major pathway involved in COL11A1
silencing-induced degradation of PDK1. Notably, after
MG132 treatment, the pattern of PDK1 ubiquitination in
A2780 cells was more extensive than that in A2780CP70
cells, and it could be rescued by exogenous overexpression
of COL11A1. Conversely, COL11A1 silencing facilitated
ubiquitination of PDK1 in A2780CP70 cells (Fig. 4C).
Immunoprecipitation assays showed that the binding

between COL11A1 and PDK1 was enhanced by
treatment with anticancer drugs (Fig. 4D), which was
in agreement with the suppressed PDK1 degradation
observed in A2780CP70 cells (Fig. 4E). These changes
were not observed in A2780 cells (Figs. 4D and 4E).
The relationship between COL11A1 and PDK1 was
further examined by immunofluorescence in A2780 and
A2780CP70 cells treated with cisplatin (Fig. 4F). In
A2780 cells, COL11A1 staining was minimal or absent,
and the intensity and nuclear localization of PDK1
were not increased by cisplatin treatment. In contrast,
A2780CP70 cells contained both cytoplasmic and nuclear
clusters of COL11A1 and PDK1 immunoreactivity.

Cisplatin treatment enhanced COL11A1 and PDK1
staining at 6 h. COL11A1-PDK1 colocalization was
primarily detected in the perinuclear region (Fig. 4F).
Collectively, these results indicate that PDK1 stabilization
in chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells could be increased
by COL11A1.
In order to elucidate the mechanism underlying the
emergence of chemoresistance in ovarian cancer cells,
we established cisplatin- and paclitaxel-resistant strains
by chronic exposure of IGROV1, ES2, and OVCAR4
cells to increasing doses of cisplatin (up to 1 μM for
IGROV1 and up to 0.5 μM for OVCAR4) and paclitaxel

independent resistant IGROV1 clones were isolated
at various times. The IC50 values for the CP1 (1  μM

increased (Fig. 5A). Notably, crossresistance to cisplatin

cycloheximide pulse-chase experiment indicated that
the half-life of PDK1 protein was significantly lower in
shCOL11A1 cells than in shcontrol cells (Fig. 5D). In
addition, the pattern of PDK1 ubiquitination observed after
MG132 treatment was also more extensive in shCOL11A1
cells than in shcontrol cells (Fig. 5E). Immunoprecipitation
assays indicated that the binding between COL11A1
and PDK1 was elevated by treatment with anticancer
drugs in cells that acquired chemoresistance, but not
in the parenteral cells (Fig. 5F). Similar phenomena
were observed in OVCAR4 cells that acquired

chemoresistance (Supplementary Figures 4A and 4B;
Fig. 5G). To determine whether PDK1 was required
for the decrease in p-Akt levels induced by COL11A1
knockdown, PDK1 shRNA was introduced into various
COL11A1-overexpresing cells to knockdown PDK1. The
elevated p-Akt and C/EBPβ levels induced by COL11A1
transfection were reduced by introduction of PDK1
shRNA (Fig. 5H). These results indicate that COL11A1
increases the levels of phosphorylated Akt by stabilizing
PDK1 protein, which promotes chemoresistance.

staining of COL11A1 protein in tumour tissue sections
from two EOC patients with chemoresistant disease showed
that the percentage of tumour cells stained positive for
COL11A1 and the intensity of COL11A1 staining markedly
increased after chemotherapy compared to those at initial
diagnosis (Fig. 6B).

also demonstrated in chemoresistant cells derived from
different subtypes of EOC. Resistant cells exhibited higher
expression of COL11A1, c/EBPβ, Akt, and PDK1 than
chemosensitive cells. We also found that drug sensitivity in
chemosensitive cells could be reduced by overexpression
of COL11A1 and that chemoresistance could be
overcome by downregulation of COL11A1 or c/EBPβ.
In a non-stressed state in chemosensitive cells, binding
activity between COL11A1 and PDK1 was minimal and
was unaltered by treatment with anticancer drugs, which
in fact resulted in PDK1 ubiquitination and degradation.
In chemoresistant cells, cisplatin enhanced c/EBPβ- and
COL11A1-induced Akt-PDK1 binding, resulting in
attenuation of PDK1 ubiquitination and degradation and
protection of the cells from cytotoxic insults. Based on
these findings, we propose that COL11A1 increases cancer
chemosensitivity (Fig. 5I) and could serve as a therapeutic
biomarker for EOC.

DISCUSSION
We identified COL11A1 as a candidate biomarker
of chemoresistance in ovarian cancer. The principal
finding of our study is that EOC patients with COL11A1
overexpression had a higher rate of resistance to
chemotherapy and shorter survival after first-line
platinum-based regimens, indicating that elevated
COL11A1 expression is an important chemoresistance
marker of poor long-term survival. This finding was

molecular mechanisms underlying chemoresistance in
patients with aggressive cancers such as EOC might aid
the design of new treatment strategies. Our results suggest
that although cisplatin and paclitaxel exert their killing
effects on ovarian cancer cells, they simultaneously
induce the emergence of a subpopulation of cancer cells
with activated Akt/c/EBPβ/COL11A1 signalling, which
confers chemoresistance. In our study, ovarian cancer
cells resistant to cisplatin or paclitaxel showed similar
molecular changes, and cross-resistance between cisplatin
and paclitaxel occurred in our cell models. This finding
should alert clinicians to the possibility of cisplatin and
paclitaxel cross-resistance and provide an explanation for
the high recurrence rate following standard combination
cisplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy. However, crossresistance was not observed between cisplatin/paclitaxel
and gemcitabine/LipoDox®, and neither gemcitabine nor
LipoDox® treatment activated the Akt/c/EBPβ/COL11A1
signalling pathway. Gemcitabine and LipoDox® are the
most commonly used second-line therapy for EOC.
This suggests that chemoresistance to anticancer drugs
might be increased through distinct signalling pathways.
Further research is needed to explore the mechanisms
underlying cisplatin and paclitaxel cross-resistance and
how chemoresistance to gemcitabine or LipoDox® is
decreased.
EOC is a highly heterogeneous disease that consists
of four major histologic subtypes: serous, endometrioid,
clear cell, and mucinous carcinoma. Our data show that
COL11A1 is induced by cisplatin and paclitaxel through
Akt/c/EBPβ in various ovarian cancer cell lines, including
A2780CP70 (endometrioid), IGROV1 (mixed), ES2
(serous), and OVCAR4 (serous) [36, 37]. These findings
suggest that regulation of COL11A1 transcription by
cisplatin and paclitaxel via the Akt/c/EBPβ pathway is a
relatively common phenomenon in EOC. One limitation
of this study is the sample size for each of the EOC
subtypes examined. Further investigation with a largesample cohort is warranted to determine not only the
COL11A1 alterations that occur during treatment but
also the usefulness of COL11A1 for monitoring treatment
responses compared with serial serum CA125 levels.
Furthermore, more investigative efforts are needed to
answer certain unresolved questions by determining the
expression of COL11A1 and Akt-PDK1 in clinical tumour
specimens from our cohorts.
We previously investigated the importance
of COL11A1 in EOC. The results of our previous
studies indicated that COL11A1 may promote cell
aggressiveness  via the TGF-β1/Ets-1/MMP3 axis and
that the NF-YA binding site in the COL11A1 promoter
is the major determinant of TGF-β1-induced COL11A1
expression [7]. In the present study, we elucidated the
mechanisms by which COL11A1 promotes cancer cell
sensitivity to anticancer drugs, and we observed that,
in ovarian cancer cells, chemoresistance developed via
activation of the Akt/c/EBPβ pathway in concert with

This study demonstrated that the c/EBPβ binding
site in the COL11A1 promoter (−541/−203) is necessary
for activation of transcription by cisplatin and paclitaxel
in chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells. The importance of
c/EBPβ also stems from the finding that it functions as a
mediator of cell survival and tumorigenesis [18, 19]. In
addition, c/EBPβ expression is increased by activation of
the Akt pathway [20]. Therefore, we identified Akt as a
potential upstream regulator of c/EBPβ in chemoresistant
ovarian cancer cells.
Overexpression and/or activation of the PI3K/
Akt survival pathway have been shown to be associated
with carcinogenesis in several tissue types [21–25]. One
of the main downstream effectors of PI3K is the potent
oncogenic serine/threonine kinase Akt, also known
as protein kinase B (PKB) [26, 27]. Akt is activated
by phosphorylation of Thr308 by the phosphoinositidedependent kinase 1 (PDK1) [15, 16] and phosphorylation
of Ser473 by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex
2 (mTORC2) [28]. Activated Akt functions to regulate
several important molecular pathways, including
those associated with cell survival, proliferation, and
apoptosis. In the present study, we showed that the level
of phosphorylated Akt was elevated in chemoresistant
ovarian cancer cells and that treatment with an Akt
inhibitor enhanced sensitivity to anticancer drugs.
These findings are consistent with previous studies
showing that Akt is a determinant of cisplatin sensitivity
in chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells [29–35]. Here,
we further showed that COL11A1 could increase
phosphorylated Akt in chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells
by stabilizing PDK1 protein. Further evidence of these
observations is provided by the reduced PDK1 protein
expression observed in COL11A1-knockdown cells, the
marked increase in PDK1 protein in the presence of the
26S proteasome inhibitor MG132, and the proteasomal
degradation of PDK1 observed in the presence of
COL11A1 defects. We also observed that phosphorylated
Akt levels in chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells were
increased by COL11A1 via increased binding activity
between PDK1 and COL11A1. Collectively, our results
showed that overexpression of COL11A1 leads to
chemoresistance, possibly by binding to PDK1-akt, and
subsequently preventing PDK1 degradation. This binding
may prevent cisplatin- and paclitaxel-induced PDK1
ubiquitination and degradation in these cells. To our
knowledge, this study is the first report on the binding
activity of COL11A1 and PDK1-akt in ovarian cancer
cells under cisplatin and paclitaxel challenge. The results
of this study suggest that COL11A1 may be an important
determinant of chemoresistance that acts by sequestering
PDK1 and preventing its ubiquitination and proteasomal
degradation. Further studies using GST pull-down assays
and/or X-ray crystallography analysis are needed to
explore the binding activity of PDK1 and COL11A1.

increased PDK1 degradation (Fig. 6C). The findings
from our cell-based models were further supported by
clinical evidence in EOC patients. Collectively, our
findings highlight the importance of COL11A1 in EOC
tumour progression and chemoresistance, and suggest
that future therapies targeting COL11A1 or the Akt
signalling pathway [38] might provide new opportunities
for therapeutic intervention in chemoresistant EOC.

Total RNA (5 μg) was used as the template in the
cDNA synthesis reaction with random primers using
Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems).
The resultant cDNA was used (at a 1:20 dilution) to
detect the expression of endogenous COL11A1 mRNA
by qPCR. Accurate quantitation was achieved through
the generation of standard curves by serially diluting a
known amount of RNA from an in vitro transcription
reaction and performing TaqMan qPCR on the series
alongside the patient samples. Quantitative analysis
of mRNA expression was performed using the Light
Cycler® 2.0 System (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). The
primers and TaqMan probes used for the analyses were
designed according to the manufacturer’s software, Primer

(no-RT) control reactions were performed using 100 ng
of total RNA from each individual sample as a template
to ensure that the amplification was not due to DNA
contamination. No signal was detected in the no-RT
controls. Target gene mRNA expression was assessed
by real-time RT-PCR. The housekeeping gene GAPDH
was used as the internal control for RNA quality. All of
the quantitative analyses were performed in duplicate to
assess the consistency of the results. The relative levels of
the target gene, normalized to GAPDH, were expressed as
ΔCt = Ct (target)−Ct (GAPDH). The ratio of the number of
copies of the target gene mRNA to the number of copies
of GAPDH was then calculated as 2 −ΔCt × K (K = 106,
a constant).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
For the microarray analysis, we obtained tissue from
60 patients with FIGO stage I–IV EOC who underwent
comprehensive staging surgery or cytoreduction at our
hospital between 2002 and 2010 [7]. Ovarian cancer
specimens were intra-operatively collected following the
standard protocol. We included a total of 104 EOC patients
in the study. Review of medical records and pathologic
slides for these patients provided clinical characteristics,
pathologic diagnoses, and outcome information. The
patients were followed up after treatment, and the date
of the latest record retrieved was May 31, 2014. Both OS
and PFS were calculated from the date of diagnosis, and
PFI was measured to the date of last contact. EOC patients
with PFIs ≤ or > 6 months were divided into “resistant”
and “sensitive” to platinum-based chemotherapy groups,
respectively. This study was approved by the institutional
review board at our hospital (A-EX-102–015), and
informed consent was obtained from all study subjects.

Microarray data analysis for the identification
of genes associated with chemoresponse in
ovarian cancer
Gene expression arrays were generated from a
subset of ovarian cancer patients who were described in
our previous report [7]. The gene expression profiles of the
samples were assessed using GeneChip® Human Genome
U133 2.0 Plus 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara,
CA, USA), and the raw data from the arrays have been
made available to the public through Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO; accession number GSE44104). Samples
from patients with stable disease (SD) or progressive
disease (PD) after chemotherapy were defined as the
chemoresistant group, and samples from patients with a
complete response (CR) after chemotherapy were defined
as the chemosensitive group. A gene was considered
significantly differentially expressed if the fold change
(up- or down-regulation) between the two groups was
greater than 2-fold and the t-test p-value was less than
0.01. The fold change of a gene was calculated as the
average expression in the chemoresistance samples
divided by the average expression in the chemosensitive
samples.

We included 2 chemoresistant patients who
experienced secondary cytoreductive surgery to relieve
bothersome symptoms when their disease progressed
during paclitaxel-carboplatin doublet chemotherapy.
Cancerous tissues from the ovarian site at diagnosis and
peritoneal tumours at disease progression were fixed
in  formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned
(4 μm thick). The sections were mounted on microscope
slides, dried (16 h, 37°C), deparaffinized in xylene,
rehydrated in graded alcohol, and rinsed with tap water.
The sections were examined to confirm the histopathology
after routine staining with hematoxylin and eosin. Briefly,
IHC staining of COL11A1 protein was performed on
deparaffinized tissue sections of formalin-fixed material
after microwave-enhanced epitope retrieval based on the
standard automated procedure (Ventana XT autostainer;

Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at a 1:20 dilution. In
the negative control, the primary antibody was replaced
with phosphate-buffered saline. Intensely COL11A1positive normal hepatocytes were used as positive
controls. The investigator (C-C Chen) was blinded to the
clinical outcome of the specimens examined. The staining
intensity was categorized as follows: negative = grade 0,
weak = grade 1, moderate = grade 2, and strong = grade 3.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software
program (Version 11.0; SPSS Inc.). Frequency
distributions between categorical variables were compared
using Pearson chi-square test and Fisher’s exact method.
Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method
and compared by log-rank tests.
