read with interest the article by Spiess et al. in this issue of
Cancer. Patients who present with widely metastatic germ cell
tumors (GCTs) are characteristically treated with cisplatin-based
chemotherapy. Depending on the patient population selected,
approximately 70% of these patients will obtain a complete clinical response, with normalization of serum tumor markers and
the complete resolution of all metastatic disease. The policy at
Indiana University has been to observe these patients because
only 3% to 5% will develop disease recurrence.2 Those patients
not achieving a complete clinical response, with residual radiographic tumor and serum tumor marker normalization, routinely
undergo postchemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (PC–RPLND). Pathology of the residual tumor mass at postchemotherapy surgery consists of necrosis in 45% of cases,
teratoma in 45% of cases, and cancer in 10% of cases.
The surgical resection of necrotic tissue after chemotherapy
offers no therapeutic beneﬁt to the patient. Therefore, postchemotherapy surgery with the ﬁnding of necrosis is a staging procedure
only. The rate of disease recurrence in this population is <5% and we
would not typically reimage the retroperitoneum and follow the
patient only with physical examination, chest imaging, and serum tumor markers. Donohue and Foster reported a 93% progression–free
survival rate for patients harboring ﬁbrosis only at the time of
PC%RPLND.3 Researchers at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center recently reported recurrence rates for resected ﬁbrosis in 150
patients treated between 1989 and 1997 and 113 patients treated
between 1998 and 2003.4 The 5-year disease–free survival rate was
83% and 95%, respectively, for men treated between these 2 time periods. Ideally, patients with known residual ﬁbrosis would be excluded
from surgery although currently we are unable to accurately predict
necrosis with the use of clinical parameters. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Medical Research Council
(EORTC/MRC) recently assessed the external validity of a prediction
rule developed to predict the probability of retroperitoneal metastases being necrosis only after chemotherapy.5 Patients with a high
probability of necrosis might be offered surveillance as opposed to
surgery. Criteria used to calculate the probability of benign histology
included: the absence/presence of teratoma in the primary tumor,

prechemotherapy serum tumor marker levels, and
maximum transverse dimension of the retroperitoneal
mass as measured on computed tomography scan
(CT) before and after chemotherapy. In the validation
set, only 4% of residual masses were classiﬁed as benign and these patients would have received surveillance in lieu of surgery. Although the prediction rule
accurately identiﬁed benign histology, so few patients
met the classiﬁcation criteria that the clinical usefulness of this tool remains limited.
Surgical resection of residual tumor or teratoma is
rational and well–accepted because both entities may
grow and metastasize and lead to signiﬁcant patient
morbidity and even death. Teratoma is not sensitive to
chemotherapy and therefore surgical resection is the
only therapeutic option. The rate of disease recurrence
for patients with resected teratoma is 10%, with a
greater possibility of local (retroperitoneal) disease recurrence the larger the volume of disease.6 Donohue
and Foster reported a progression–free survival rate of
89% for 273 patients harboring residual teratoma at the
time of surgery.3 In an international study, Stenning
et al. reported similar results in a cohort of 153 patients
undergoing PC–RPLND.7 The 2-year progression free
survival rate for patients with resected mature and
immature teratoma was 86% and 89%, respectively. The
Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center recently
reported the outcomes of 210 men with residual retroperitoneal teratoma after induction chemotherapy.8
With a median follow-up of 37 months for survivors,
disease recurrence was noted in 30 patients. The
patients’ probability of remaining disease free at 5 years
and 10 years was 83% and 80%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, size of the residual mass and International Germ Cell Consensus Classiﬁcation (IGCCC) risk
category were found to be predictive of disease recurrence. The median postchemotherapy tumor size in
this group was 3.0 cm (interquartile range, 1.5–5.3 cm).
We recently evaluated the recurrence rate for resected,
large–volume teratoma after chemotherapy. The 2–year
and 5-year DFS rates for 99 patients with residual postchemotherapy teratoma measuring >10 cm were 86%
and 75%, respectively, at a mean follow-up of 42
months.9 Typically in the postchemotherapy setting after resection of residual teratoma, we would recommend CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis periodically
in addition to serial chest imaging, physical examination, and serum tumor markers.
Active cancer is identiﬁed in 10% of patients after
standard postchemotherapy surgery. Donohue and
Foster reported a recurrence–free survival rate of 70%
in this population, all of whom received adjuvant
chemotherapy. Fizazi et reported on 238 patients with
viable residual disease after ﬁrst-line chemotherapy.10
The 5-year progression–free survival rate was 64%.

Three variables found to be signiﬁcant on multivariate
analysis were used to risk–stratify this population and
included incomplete surgery, viable malignant cells
>10%, and a poor–risk or intermediate–risk IGCCC
category. Patients with no adverse factors experienced
a 5-year progression–free survival rate of 90% compared with 41% for patients with 2 risk factors.
The ﬁnding of viable nonseminomatous germ cell
tumor (NSGCT) in the postchemotherapy resected
specimen is associated with a higher risk of disease recurrence. In 1981, Einhorn et al. reported on 22
patients with cancer in their postresection specimens.11 Of these 22 patients, only 2 were long-term
survivors. However, only 4 patients received postoperative cisplatin–based chemotherapy, and both
long-term survivors were in that group. The International Study Group compared progression–free survival and overall survival in patients found to have
viable NSGCT at postchemotherapy surgery receiving
and those not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.10 The
5-year recurrence–free survival rate for 166 patients
receiving adjuvant chemotherapy was 69% compared
with 52% for the 65 patients not receiving postoperative chemotherapy (P < .001). On multivariate analysis, postoperative chemotherapy was found to be
associated with a signiﬁcantly better progression–free
survival (P < .001), but overall survival was not
improved (P ¼ .26). It appears that the presence of
viable NSGCT portends a poor prognosis and, as such,
it has been standard practice to administer 2 courses
of adjuvant chemotherapy in this population.
In the current study, the group from the University
of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center evaluated the
risk of disease recurrence and death in patients with
viable GCT at PC–RPLND.1 The cohort included 41
patients with a median follow-up of 3.9 years. Eighteen
patients (44%) developed disease recurrence and 12
patients (29%) died of disease. Predictors of disease recurrence included risk classiﬁcation only, whereas predictors of death included postoperative disease recurrence
and an elevated serum a–fetoprotein (AFP) level.
From the authors’ tumor registry, a total of 236
patients undergoing postchemotherapy surgery were
identiﬁed between 1980 and 2003. Of these, 41
patients (17%) with active cancer comprised the current series.1 Twenty–ﬁve patients received ﬁrst-line
chemotherapy, 8 patients received second-line chemotherapy, and 8 patients underwent ‘‘desperation’’
RPLND, deﬁned by this group as elevated serum tumor markers after second-line or salvage chemotherapy. The authors noted a decline in the incidence of
active cancer from 34.6% in the 1980s to 18% from
1990 through 2003 (P ¼.02).1 Because the incidence of
active cancer is greater at salvage or ‘‘desperation’’ surgery, the time period when such patients underwent

Editorial/Beck

postchemotherapy surgery may explain the observed
decline in residual cancer. Alternatively, as Spiess et al.
noted, this observation may have resulted from the use
of more effective chemotherapeutic regimens.1
Although not predictive of disease recurrence, an
elevated serum AFP level was found to be predictive of
disease–speciﬁc survival. The 5-year disease–speciﬁc
survival rate for the 32 patients with a serum AFP level
<5.3 ng/mL was 84%, versus 29% for the 9 patients
with a serum AFP level >5.3 ng/mL (P ¼ .0007).1 This
data demonstrates the prognostic signiﬁcance of
elevated serum tumor markers at the time of postchemotherapy surgery. The authors do state that preoperative chemotherapy should be offered until
normalization of the serum tumor markers before surgery. Indiana University recently reviewed its experience of RPLND in patients with preoperatively
elevated serum tumor markers.12 This study included
114 patients, all of whom had elevated serum tumor
markers after either induction chemotherapy alone
(50 patients) or salvage chemotherapy (64 patients).
The 5-year overall survival rate was 54%. At the time of
last follow–up, 61 patients (53.5%) were alive with a
median follow-up of 5 years. Fifty-three patients died
of disease, with a median time to death of 8.0 months.
Retroperitoneal pathology revealed GCT in 53.5%, teratoma in 34.2%, and ﬁbrosis in 12.2% of patients, with
5-year survival rates of 31%, 77%, and 86%, respectively. The decision to proceed with surgery in lieu of
second–line or third–line chemotherapy despite elevated serum tumor markers includes identifying both
those patients believed to be unlikely to obtain a complete response with systemic therapy (and thus require
surgery) and those patients with resectable tumors
that are potentially curable with surgery. The rationale
for surgery in this clinical setting is 3-fold. One, the
patient may be cured with surgery alone, thereby
avoiding the morbidity of additional chemotherapy.
Second, if disease progression does occur after surgery, salvage or high–dose chemotherapy may still be
administered in hopes for cure. However, third, if salvage or high–dose chemotherapy is administered initially and the patient develops disease progression and
now has unresectable disease, the opportunity of cure
with surgery is lost. As such, with appropriate patient
selection, forgoing additional chemotherapy despite
elevated serum tumor markers and proceeding with
surgery is potentially curable while simultaneously
avoiding the toxicity of additional systemic therapy.
It is interesting to note that in the current study
from the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center, of the 5 patients with active cancer in the
resected specimen who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy, none developed a disease recurrence.1 This is

2603

in contrast to the recurrence rate of 50% observed in the
36 patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. This seemingly contradictory ﬁnding may be simply patient
selection or may be secondary to the heterogeneity of
the cohort as 10 different chemotherapeutic regiments
were administered over the 23–year period.
The study by Spiess et al.1 re-emphasizes the important role of surgery in managing testicular cancer
and demonstrates that PC–RPLND can be curative in
patients harboring active disease.
