ABSTRACT
This study aimed to evaluate plasma concentration of selected cancer-associated
inflammatory and immune-modulated cytokines in HIV+ patients with advanced
Kaposi sarcoma (KS), and to explore candidate biomarkers capable of predicting
clinical outcome in response to chemotherapy (CT) plus combination antiretroviral
therapy (cART).
Thirty-seven plasma cytokines/chemokines were assessed by Luminex
technology in 27 consecutive HIV+ KS patients, followed-up during CT and cART of
maintanence (m-cART). Associations between plasma concentration of biomarkers
and patient clinical response to m-cART were evaluated by means of Hazard Ratios
(HRs) and corresponding 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs).
Plasma baseline concentration of Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF),
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and endoglin were found to be associated with m-cART
clinical response (HR:1.56, 95%CI:1.09–2.22, p = 0.01; HR:0.32, 95% CI:0.10–0.99,
p = 0.05; HR:0.72, 95% CI:0.54–0.96, p = 0.03, respectively). The multivariate
analysis confirmed the associations of baseline plasma G-CSF and HGF concentration
with m-cART clinical complete remission response (HR:1.78, 95% CI:1.15–2.74,
p = 0.009; HR:0.19, 95% CI:0.04–0.95, p = 0.04).
Our exploratory study suggested that plasma G-CSF, HGF and endoglin may be
novel predictors of clinical response during m-cART in HIV+ KS patients. Nonetheless,
these findings should be further validated in an independent population study.

cytokines and chemokines, possibly up-regulated by
the Tat protein of HIV or the Kaposi sarcoma related
herpesvirus (KSHV) infection, induce the expression
of growth factors and act synergistically in promoting
and sustaining cell proliferation [3, 4]. These involved
biological factors can be released and they are detectable
in the blood, mirroring the tumour microenvironment. The
measurement of candidates prognostic disease soluble
biomarkers is rapidly evolving. Luminex multiparametric

INTRODUCTION
Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is the most frequent malignant
lesion in patients with AIDS, even after the widespread
use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), and it
is characterized by spindle cell proliferation, inflammatory
cell infiltration, angiogenesis, edema, and invasiveness
[1, 2]. The complex aspect of this disease is probably
supported by multiple concomitant pathogenetic factors.
Today, the most favoured model is that inflammatory

HIV infection and related tumours and for the prediction
of patient’s clinical outcome [5, 6, 7].
KS treatment choice considers the tumour extent and
growth, the patient’s symptoms, the immunological and
virological conditions, the opportunistic co-infections,
and the related complications [8, 9]. The use of cART
and effective control of HIV viremia may represent
the first treatment choice in case of slowly progressive
disease, while chemotherapy (CT) plus cART is indicated
for visceral and/or rapidly progressive disease [8].
Maintenance (m)-cART after debulking CT has been
described as an effective anti-KS treatment [10, 11].
Although the survival of HIV+ patients on cART has
substantially improved, long-term and cumulative CTrelated immunodeficiency play a critical role in the
long-term management of patients with KSHV-related
advanced diseases [12], with an increased risk of death.
Moreover, KSHV infection cannot be eradicated but longterm remission is possible, especially in patients whose
immune system can be modulated by cART. Improved and
innovative therapies are urgently needed along with new
and non-invasive biomarkers to help in the identification
of patients with poor clinical response who could be
candidates for different or additional treatments.
In this exploratory clinical study, circulating
cytokines and other signalling molecules, involved in
angiogenesis, inflammation and tumour growth, were
measured among HIV+ advanced KS patients before
CT and during maintenance therapy. The study tested
the hypothesis that candidate non invasive biomarkers
were associated with KS patients clinical response to
m-cART.

3/27 patients (11.1%) showed new PR, and 8/27 patients
(30%) showed rapid disease progression.

Plasma biomarkers and clinical patient’s
response to m-cART
To evaluate the association between plasma
concentrations of the 37 biomarkers and patient’s clinical
response to m-cART, HRs and 95% CIs were calculated
for continuous variations of these immunological
parameters assessed at baseline, before starting CT (T0).
Plasma concentrations of 3 out of 37
immunological biomarkers were found to be significantly
associated to m-cART clinical response of KS HIV+
patients (Table 2). In particular, a statistically significant
association with unfavourable clinical response to
m-cART was found for G-CSF plasma concentration
(HR:1.56, 95% CI:1.09–2.22; p = 0.01). Plasma
concentrations of HGF (HR:0.32, 95% CI:0.10–0.99;
p = 0.05) and of endoglin (HR:0.72, 95% CI:0.54–0.96;
p = 0.03) were associated to favourable clinical response
to m-cART.
The associations of plasma G-CSF and HGF
concentrations with patient’s complete remission response
during m-cART were further confirmed by the multivariate
analysis (HR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.15–2.74, p = 0.009;
HR: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.04–0.95, p = 0.04) (Table 2).
Plasma
concentrations
of
the
other
cytokines/chemokines, angiogenesis/growth factors
or metalloproteinases assessed at T0 did not show any
statistically significant association with patient’s response
to the treatment.
Plasma concentrations of G-CSF and HGF were
plotted and represented in Figure 1. The HRs for patient
response to m-cART decreased continuously, without
a precise identified threshold value, with HGF plasma
concentration increases (with the upper limit of the
95% CI constantly below 1.0), whereas HRs increased
continuously with G-CSF plasma concentration increases.
Further, the overall median duration of response to
m-cART was 45.9 months (not shown). Median responses
to m-cART according to the concentration of the three
plasma biomarkers measured at baseline and found to
be statistically significant were: 52.1 months for G-CSF
<157 pg/ml (vs. 24.3 months for ≥157 pg/ml), 54.2 months
for HGF ≥111 pg/ml (vs. 11.3 months for <111 pg/ml),
54.2 months for endoglin ≥1113 pg/ml (vs. 10.2 months
for <1113 pg/ml). All Log-rank tests were statistically
significant (Table 3).
Moreover, when evaluating, at T1 or T2, plasma
concentrations of G-CSF, endoglin, HGF, no statistically
significant changes emerged between patients who were
clinically responders to m-cART and those who were not
(data not shown), likewise for HIV RNA or KSHV DNA
viral loads or CD4 cell counts.

RESULTS
Patients characteristics
Blood samples for the 27 KS HIV+ patients before
starting debulking CT were available; baseline plasma
concentrations for the 37 immunological biomarkers
and routinely evaluated HIV RNA, KSHV DNA and
CD4/CD8 cell counts are shown in Table 1. At baseline,
KSHV DNA was detectable in 17/27 patients with a
median viral load of 50 (range: 0–8247) copies/ml, and
HIV RNA in 12/27 patients with a median viral load
of 170 (range: 49–257267) copies/ml. The evaluated
baseline immunological status was as follows: CD4 cell
counts 16.9 (range: 1.7–42.8) %, with median value of
188 (range: 7–1036) cells/mm3; CD8 cell counts 53.9
(range: 38.9–74.5) %, with median value of 860 (range:
279–2205) cells/mm3.
Tumour clinical responses observed, considering
clinical maximum response to m-cART (at T2), were:
complete remission (CR) in 13/27 patients (48.2%), 3/27
patients (11.1%) were on stable partial remission (PR),

DISCUSSION

Consortium study on rapamycin with HAART,
no significant changes in IL-6 and VEGF plasma
concentrations, viral load and CD4 counts were observed
during KS monitoring [14]. In a phase I trial of the MMP
inhibitor COL-3, a significant decline in plasma levels of
MMP-2 and MMP-9 was reported in AIDS related KS
responders [15]. In a recent phase II trial of Imatinib,
no correlation was found between KS-AIDS treatment
response and changes in any of the different evaluated
cytokines [16].
The specific roles of each biomarker are complex
and multifactorial, considering that the cytokines involved
in KS disease modulate multiple immune, inflammatory
and other kind of responses. They are provided by
chronically activated cells of the immune system or
in autocrine/paracrine manner by the neoplastic cells
themselves. Nonetheless, the biomarkers found to be
correlated with HIV+ KS patients clinical outcome were
three well defined growth factors with emerging biological
roles.
Endoglin is a membrane glycoprotein, co-receptor
for the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)
superfamily, which preferentially binds TGF- β1 and

Identification of predictive and prognostic
biomarkers for patients with different diseases and
undergoing different therapeutic options is a very active
area of investigation. Multiplex cytokines, chemokines,
angiogenetic and growth factors were evaluated in a group
of consecutive HIV+ patients with advanced KS, who
were treated with CT plus cART followed by m-cART.
Baseline plasma concentrations of G-CSF, HGF and
endoglin were associated to clinical treatment response.
At the multivariate analysis, G-CSF and HGF baseline
plasma concentrations were confirmed to be associated to
clinical complete remission response to m-cART.
For KSHV-related diseases, measurement of
circulating biomarkers for the prediction of clinical
outcome is still at an early stage but rapidly evolving
[7]. We previously identified KSHV viral load as a
prognostic factor of clinical outcome in KSHV-related
lymphoproliferative disorders [13]. In contrast, in this
KS group of patients on m-cART, neither KSHV DNA
nor CD4/CD8 cell counts were associated with patient’s
clinical outcome. Similarly, in an AIDS Malignancy

TGF- β3. This protein is highly expressed by activating
proliferating cells with a key function in angiogenesis
[17]. In AIDS KS patients, endoglin stains were positive
in the endothelium of tumour associated vessels of most
KS biopsies [18]. Membrane endoglin is cleaved in the
juxtamembrane region by the membrane anchored matrix
metalloprotease MMP14 to release soluble endoglin [19].
Increased levels of circulating soluble endoglin were
linked to poor prognosis in different human tumours
[20, 21, 22, 23]. However, the function of soluble endoglin
in carcinogenesis is still debated, though an antiangiogenic
role in the tumour microenvironment was suggested, based
on its in vitro capability of reducing both spontaneous
and VEGF-induced angiogenesis [19]. Disturbance in
the balance between membrane-localized and soluble
form may occur in pathologic conditions, such as tumour
characterized by angiogenic activity, like KS. The local
regulation of endoglin shedding, mediated by regulation
of endothelial MMP-14 expression, could result in
remarkable changes in soluble endoglin concentration in
the tumour microenviroment, with consequent effects on
the angiogenic potential of tumour-associated endothelial
cells. We could, therefore, speculate that plasma endoglin
concentration of AIDS KS patients may result from an
increased endoglin cleavage from membrane endoglin of
the tumour cells and decreased membrane localization. The
associated complete remission response during m-cART
could be then related to the inhibition of angiogenesis
induced by soluble endoglin, thus supporting, also in KS
setting, its proposed anti-angiogenic action [19].
HGF and its Met receptor are involved in
the pathogenesis of KS whose biological features
are compatible with the biological properties of
HGF for invasive growth, tumour proliferation, and
neovascularisation [24, 25, 26]. Moreover, multiple and
more complex events with different biological effects
are controlled also by the cooperative interaction of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the biomarkers. A recent report proposed an intriguing
interaction between endoglin and HGF, showing that
soluble endoglin inhibited baseline and HGF stimulated
Met signalling, impairing proliferation, migration
and invasion of spindle cells, in mouse tumour model
[27]. According to this hypothesis, high plasma levels
of endoglin and HGF detected in HIV+ KS patients
associated with better outcome may behave as suppressors
of KS malignancy, with consequent diminished
proliferation and angiogenesis. Then again, our HIV+ KS
patients might be characterised by a down regulation of
Met receptor in relation to the HIV status or according to
the type of KS lesion and progression stage [28]; therefore,
it resulted in an impaired receptor interaction despite the
high baseline HGF plasma levels.
G-CSF belongs to the family of glycoprotein
molecules that stimulate the production of white blood
cells, particularly granulocytes, and also mobilizes
hematopoietic stem cells into peripheral blood [29].
Moreover, G-CSF acts as promoter of tumour growth
through stimulation of tumour-associated angiogenesis, by
increasing mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells into
peripheral circulation from the bone marrow [30, 31]. This
action may in part support the prognostic negative role of
the high baseline plasma G-CSF concentration of HIV+
advanced KS patients. The pharmacological administration
of G-CSF after chemotherapy, in the setting of HIV-related
diseases, mostly with pre-existing myelosuppression, has
shown clinical benefit with partial restoration of immune
response [32]. However, in the current era of specific
antineoplastic treatment for KS, therapy is well tolerated
and usually no colony stimulating factors are required to
support neutrophil counts in these patients. On the other
hand, the indications that G-CSF can recruit potential KS
progenitors and induce spindle cell differentiation and
proliferation, indeed, open a new scenario in the cellular
origin of malignant cell phenotype, pathobiology, and KS

based therapies [33]. Plasma high levels of this growth
factor may also be related to the cytokines alterations
and to switching profiles that may influence HIV-related
disease progression and also contribute to the severity
of CD4 cell depletion. A tolerable ratio CD4/CD8
characterized the study patients, but a negative correlation
of plasma G-CSF concentration to CD4 cell counts (data
not shown) was found, though not statistically significant,
similar to the inverse association reported by Shebl
et al. [34].
The small sample size and length of patient followup represent the main weakness of our exploratory study.
In addition, although several biomarkers were screened,
we could not array matched healthy donors and/or HIV+
non KS patients to be evaluated in parallel. Despite these
limits, our results showed that multiplexed analysis
of plasma biomarkers is useful for the evaluation of
prognostic markers of clinical outcome and of potential
predictive markers of treatment response that may
support the clinical management of HIV+ KS advanced
patients. Being this a small pilot study designed to
assess feasibility, our findings are suggestive rather than
definitive. Nonetheless, the observed association of three
plasma biomarkers justifies the validation of these findings
in a large population study.

no CR patients (e.g., patients with partial remission/stable
disease or progressive disease).
After each patient provided written informed
consent, peripheral blood samples were collected at
consecutive visits: before starting (baseline, T0) and after
debulking CT (T1), and at the time of maximum clinical
response during m-cART (T2).

Laboratory methods
Whole blood was processed immediately for
cytofluorimetric analysis and T lymphocyte CD4
and CD8 subsets were evaluated by a single platform
whole blood lysing technique (EPICS XL flow
cytofluorimeter). Plasma HIV RNA viral load was
assessed by RealTime HIV-1 assay (Abbott Molecular
Diagnostics, Rome, Italy). Plasma KSHV DNA viral
load was measured by a TaqMan real-time PCR home
made method. Our molecular assay reported a good
sensitivity, with consistent and comparable KSHV
DNA viral loads detected in both plasma and PBMCs
specimens from patients with different KSHV-related
diseases [36, 37]. Therefore, we chose the plasma
method, which is also more feasible as compared to
the PBMCs one, as it requires a simpler preparation of
the sample and the beta globin standard curve does not
need to be run. Stored plasma samples were assessed
by using four different multiplex panels of cytokines/
chemokines, angiogenetic, and growth factors and
matrix metalloproteinases (Human Cytokine/Chemokine
magnetic bead panel kit, Human Angiogenesis/Growth
Factor magnetic bead panel kit, Human MMP Panel 1
and 2 magnetic bead kit, EMD Millipore Corporation,
Billerica, MA). Multiplex and different experiments
were performed using the Luminex-200 (Luminex
Co., US), following manufacturer’s instructions and as
already described [5].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
Twenty seven consecutive HIV+ patients with
advanced KS stage (≥T1), according to the AIDS Clinical
Trials Group (ACTG) classification [35], were considered
in this study. All patients were of Caucasian ethnicity,
all males, except for one female, with a median age of
41 (range: 35–52) years. They were followed-up at the
Department of Oncology & AIDS at our Institute, during
the period 1997–2012. Since then, they all received
Protease Inhibitors (PI)-based cART. They were part of an
ongoing phase II study and received 6 cycles of Liposomal
Doxorubicin plus CT, followed by cART as maintenance
anti-KS treatment (m-cART).
Clinical evaluation of treatment response was
performed after the end of debulking CT and every two
months during m-cART. Study endpoint for the evaluation
of clinical and biological correlations was set at the
maximum response to m-cART.
Clinical response to the therapy was recorded
according to ACTG criteria [35] in the following
categories: patients with complete remission (CR), partial
remission (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive
disease. De novo CR developing during m-cART was
arbitrarily defined as new CR.
In particular, for the statistical analysis, patients
were categorized into two main groups: CR patients versus

Statistical analysis
Survival probabilities were estimated by means
of the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared using
the log-rank test. Median response to m-cart was also
calculated. The association between immunological
and virological biomarkers and disease progression was
estimated by means of the Cox proportional hazards
model. Hazard Ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for continuous
variations of the considered biomarker concentration.
Analyses were firstly adjusted for HIV RNA and KSHV
DNA levels. Biomarkers with a statistically significant
association with clinical response to the treatment were
thereafter included in a multivariate model and were then
plotted. Analyses were performed by means of SAS,
version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, 2002–2008).
All statistical tests were two-sided and p-value < 0.05
