ABSTRACT
The aim of this prospective study was to assess the ability of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose
( FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scanning to
predict pathological complete response (pCR) in breast cancer, and to investigate
whether timing of the scan and trastuzumab treatment influence the accuracy of pCR
prediction in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer
patients. We treated 81 locally advanced breast cancer patients with four cycles of
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). HER2-negative breast cancer patients received NAC
alone, while HER2-positive breast cancer patients received NAC plus trastuzumab.
18
FDG PET/CT scans were scheduled at baseline and after the second cycle of NAC.
Axillary lymph node (ALN) dissection was performed after the last cycle of neoadjuvant
therapy. Relative changes in standardized uptake values (SUV) between the two PET/
CT scans (∆SUV) in primary tumors and ALN metastases were calculated. There were
75 patients with 150 PET/CT scans in the final analysis, including 41 HER2-negative
and 34 HER2-positive cases. In the HER2-negative group, the ∆SUV predicted overall
and ALN pCR; the receiver operating characteristics-areas under curve (ROC-AUC) were
0.87 and 0.80 (P = 0.0014 and 0.031, respectively) and the negative predictive values
were 94% and 89% respectively. However, in the HER2-positive group, ∆SUV could
predict neither overall nor ALN pCR; the ROC-AUCs were only 0.56 and 0.53, with P =
0.53 and 0.84, respectively. Hence, the ∆SUV after two cycles of neoadjuvant therapy
could predict pCR in HER2-negative patients treated with NAC alone, but not in HER2positive patients treated with NAC plus trastuzumab.

tool for evaluating NAC response [4–6]. Relative change
in the standardized uptake value (∆SUV) after one or two
cycles of NAC was reported to be a strong indicator of
pathological response [7]. However, treatment options
and responses to therapy differ greatly among various
phenotypes. These differences complicate the utilization
of ∆SUV as a predictor of pathological responses [8–12].
This prospective study investigated the predictive
reliability of 18FDG uptake change in patients with human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative and
HER2-positive phenotypes, particularly with respect to
axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis.

In all 75 patients, 18FDG PET/CT was performed
before and after two cycles of neoadjuvant therapy.
The SUVpeak obtained at these times could not predict
overall pCR for primary lesions or ALN metastases. The
∆SUVpeak of the primary lesion had a moderate predictive
value with a receiver operator characteristics-area under
the curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.75 (95% confidence interval
[CI] 0.65–0.86, P = 0.001); the sensitivity and specificity
were 78% and 69%, respectively.
Of all cases, 34 were in the HER2-positive group
that was treated with NAC and trastuzumab. ROC
analysis showed that the ∆SUVpeak could not effectively
predict the overall pCR because the ROC-AUC was
only 0.56 (95% CI 0.36–0.76, P = 0.53). However, for
the 41 patients of the HER2-negative group treated with
NAC alone, ROC analysis showed that the ∆SUVpeak
accurately predicted the overall pCR because the ROCAUC was 0.87 (95% CI 0.75–0.98, P = 0.0014). The
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative
predictive value, and accuracy were 75%, 85%, 60%,
94%, and 83%, respectively (Figure 1A, 1B).
In the HER2-negative group, we predicted 75% of
pCRs (6/8) and 88% of non-pCRs (29/33) by applying a
cutoff value of ∆SUVpeak > 80%. However, in the HER2positive group, the ∆SUVpeak could not predict pCR
accurately because a clear cutoff could not be defined
(Figure 2A, 2B).

RESULTS
Patients and pathologic response
Eighty-one breast cancer patients were recruited: 3
were excluded because they missed follow-up (1 triplenegative breast cancer (TNBC) and 2 HER2-positive) and
3 HER2-positive patients underwent NAC only (including
1 luminal with HER[3+]) and 2 HER2-positive). Ultimately,
75 patients were included in the final analysis. Breast cancer
was confirmed through core needle biopsy. Patients’ tumor
characteristics and treatments are listed in Table 1.
A majority of tumors were luminal (52.0%; 39/75),
followed by HER2-positive (30.6%; 23/75), and TNBC
(17.3%; 13/75). pCR occurred more often in patients with
HER2 positive tumors (52.1%) than in those with TNBC and
luminal tumors (30.7% and 28.2%, respectively). Furthermore,
the HER2-positive group treated with NAC plus trastuzumab
showed higher pCR rates than the HER2-negative group
treated with NAC alone (55.8% and 19.5%, respectively).

∆SUVpeak of ALN metastasis predicts pCR
There were 53 patients with ALN metastasis
confirmed by both core needle biopsy and 18FDG PET/
CT. Neither the baseline nor post two-cycle SUVpeak
alone could predict ALN pCR. The ∆SUVpeak of the
ALN metastases had a moderate predictive value with
an ROC-AUC of 0.74 (95% CI 0.60–0.88, P = 0.0021).
The sensitivity and specificity were 87% and 61%,
respectively.
Of all 75 cases, 28 were HER2-positive and were
treated with NAC and trastuzumab. ROC analysis showed
that the ∆SUVpeak of ALN metastasis could not predict
the ALN pCR effectively because the ROC-AUC was
only 0.53 (95% CI 0.20–0.86, P = 0.84). However, in the
HER2-negative group of 25 cases treated with NAC alone,
the ∆SUVpeak accurately predicted the ALN pCR, as the
ROC-AUC was 0.80 (95% CI 0.60–0.99, P = 0.031). The
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative
predictive value, and accuracy were 67%, 89%, 67%,
89%, and 84%, respectively (Figure 1C, 1D).
In the HER2-negative group, we could predict 66%
of pCRs (4/6) and 89% of non-pCRs (17/19) by applying a
cutoff value of ∆SUVpeak >80%. However, in the HER2positive group, the ∆SUVpeak could not accurately predict
pCR because a clear cutoff value could not be defined
(Figure 2C, 2D).

∆SUVpeak in primary lesions and metastatic
lymph nodes
A total of 150 PET/CT scans from 75 patients were
eligible for analysis. Among them, 53 had ALN metastasis
confirmed by both core needle biopsy and 18FDG PET/CT.
In the baseline PET/CT scan, the SUV peak of the primary
lesions ranged from 22.2 to 1.60 (mean = 8.14 ± 4.54). The
SUVpeak of ALN metastasis ranged from 15.87 to 1.20 (mean
= 6.35 ± 4.02). On follow-up PET/CT scans after two cycles
of neoadjuvant therapy, the SUVpeak of the primary lesions
ranged from 9.60 to 0 (mean = 2.88 ± 2.92), and that of ALN
metastases ranged from 7.79 to 0 (mean = 1.67 ± 1.76).
In the HER2-positive group, the SUVpeak of primary
lesions fell from a baseline of 7.95 ± 4.65 to 2.06 ± 3.01 in
the subsequent scan, a decrease of 73% ± 32%. Moreover,
the SUVpeak of ALN metastasis fell from a baseline of 6.46
± 3.75 to 1.19 ± 1.70, a decrease of 84% ± 18%.
In the HER2-negative group, the SUVpeak of the
primary lesions fell from a baseline of 8.28 ± 4.49 to 3.55
± 2.63, a decrease of 52% ± 33%. The SUVpeak of ALN
metastasis fell from 6.23 ± 4.30 to 2.20 ± 1.70, a decrease of
60% ± 31%. The P values were 0.005 and 0.001, respectively.

DISCUSSION

others suggest it be performed after the first cycle of
chemotherapy [15, 16].
HER2-positive breast cancers usually undergo
notable SUV changes during therapy, compared to other
phenotypes. A 60% change in SUV is easily achievable
after the first cycle of chemotherapy. This degree of change
ought to be sufficient for pCR prediction; therefore, some
researchers suggest conducting 18FDG after the first cycle

The use of 18FDG PET/CT imaging as an early
predictive tool for breast cancer pCR has recently been
encouraged. However, there has been controversy
regarding the optimal timing of 18FDG PET/CT scanning.
Most researchers advocate performing 18FDG PET/CT
scanning halfway through chemotherapy [13, 14], while

of chemotherapy to determine whether switching the
therapeutic regimen is warranted [17].
We showed that ∆SUV after two cycles of
neoadjuvan therapy accurately predicted the response
in HER2-negative, but not HER2-positive patients. This
appears to contradict existing studies. Actually, our result
reveals the same view point on scanning timing for HER2positive from another aspect. The average degree of SUV
change in the HER2-positive group was 73% ± 32%,
which was much greater than the 52% ± 33% observed in
the HER2-negative group (P = 0.005 for primary lesions
and P = 0.001 for ALN metastases). This suggests that
the optimal 18FDG PET-CT timing for the HER2-positive
group, for purposes of predicting pCR, was missed.
Another reason is that the inflammation reaction
caused by trastuzumab influences predictive accuracy.
Firstly, in addition to directly inhibiting intracellular
signaling in HER2-positive tumor cells, the combination
with trastuzumab induces antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity (ADCC), which also contributes to changes
in SUV [14]. Secondly, the decrease in 18FDG uptake in
patients receiving trastuzumab is not a pure reflection of
cell killing but also reflects other specific effects on glucose
metabolism, such as reductions in GLUT1 and hexokinase
II activity [18, 19]. As a result, breast lesion and ALN
metastasis shrink and FDG uptake decrease greatly after

two cycles of NAC due to higher sensitivity for NAC in
HER2-positive group. At the same time, inflammation
reaction caused by trastuzumab appears, causing the SUVs
of residual lesions to increase and ΔSUVs to therefore
decrease. In cases with lower SUV baselines in particular,
slight increases in SUV caused by inflammation could
easily generate false negatives (Figure 3A–3D).
The response of breast cancer ALN metastases after
NAC is of greater concern than that of the primary foci. In
previous studies of HER2-positive cancers, the complete
response rates of both primary foci and lymph nodes were
quite high; hence, overtreatment can be avoided if ALN
metastases show early pCR. Roussean et al. reported that
the sensitivity and accuracy of therapeutic effect prediction
for axillary lymph node metastases after chemotherapy were
96% and 84%, respectively, with an SUV decrease of 50% set
as the threshold [11]. Similarly, Koolen et al. reported that the
specificity and positive predictive values were 95% and 86%,
respectively, if the SUV decrease was greater than 60% and
the ROC-AUC was 0.80 [10]. There were also contradictory
reports; Jung et al. reported that there was no correlation
between SUV decrease and the pCR rate of lymph node
metastasis [20]. In these reports, the breast cancer phenotypes
were not considered, nor were the influences of therapies.
In our study, ∆SUV was shown to be a more
valuable predictor for HER2-negative patients who

of >80% predicted 88% of overall non-pCRs A. and 89% of axillary lymph node (ALN) non-pCRs C. in the HER2-negative group,
displaying higher negative predictive values of 94% and 89%, respectively. In the HER2-positive group, ∆SUVpeak could not predict

underwent NAC alone (ROC-AUC = 0.80, P = 0.031),
while the ROC-AUC of the ∆SUV decreased to 0.53 (P =
0.84) in HER2-positive patients who received NAC plus
trastuzumab. Determining a cutoff value of ∆SUVpeak >
80% can predict 66% of pCR and 89% of non-pCR in
HER2-negative patients. However, ∆SUVpeak did not
accurately predict pCR in HER2-positive patients because
a clear cutoff could not be established.
The main limitation of our study is the absence of
SUV values after the first cycle of NAC; having multiple
time points can better determine the best 18FDG PET-CT
timing for assessment.
In conclusion, this study shows that response
monitoring of breast cancer patients with 18FDG PET-CT
during neoadjuvan therapy is dependent on both phenotypes,
therapeutic regimens and scan timing. For HER2- negative
patients treated with NAC alone, the optimal timing is after
tow cycles. ∆SUV can accurately predict pCR. Application
of a cutoff ∆SUVpeak of >80% predicted 88% of overall
non-pCRs and 89% of ALN non-pCRs , displaying higher
negative predictive values of 94% and 89%, respectively.
The clinical benefit of this study is that 18FDG PET-CT could
offer the opportunity to switch to a different regimen for an
individual patient who is likely to be non-pCR to NAC.

informed consent was obtained from all patients. Enrolled
were patients with newly diagnosed, non-inflammatory,
and locally advanced (stage II and III) breast cancer
who accepted neoadjuvant therapy. Clinical stage was
determined according to the American Joint Committee on
Cancer 6th edition. Tumor size and T stage were assessed
by clinical examination, ultrasonography, and/or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). Diagnoses of invasive breast
carcinoma and ALN metastasis were confirmed by core
needle biopsy and fine needle aspiration, respectively,
in all patients. Clinical stages were determined by
mammography, ultrasonography, and MRI according to the
TNM (tumor-node-metastasis) classification. Exclusion
criteria were pregnancy, breast surgery, chemotherapy
or radiotherapy history, diabetes, age younger than 18
years old, no 18FDG uptake at baseline, or ineligibility for
surgery.

FDG PET/CT Protocol

18

FDG was produced by the Cyclotron (Siemens
CTI RDS Eclipse ST) and Explora FDG4 modules at
our center. All patients were required to fast for at least 6
hours to ensure glucose blood levels below 10 mmol/L
(180 mg/dL), which was a prerequisite for undergoing the
procedure. As long as the patient’s blood glucose level was
over 10 mmol/L(180 mg/dL), the PET/CT exam should be
cancelled. Before and after injection, patients lay comfortably
in a quiet, dimly lit room. Scanning was initiated 1 hour after
administration of the tracer (7.4 MBq/kg or 0.2 mCi/kg).
The data acquisition procedure was as follows: CT scanning
was first performed from the proximal thighs to head with
120 kV, CARE dose 4D mode, 80–250 mA, pitch 3.6.
Intravenous or oral contrast was not used in CT scans.

show that the size of the right axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis is 2.3 × 1.3 cm A. with high FDG uptake and a baseline SUVpeak
of 5.16 B. After NAC plus trastuzumab treatment, the right ALN shrank C.; FDG uptake decreased and the SUVpeak was 2.72 D. The
ΔSUVpeak is − 47% (from 5.16 to 2.72), less than the threshold of − 80%, but the result of ALN dissection was pathological complete
response. ∆SUVpeak refers to the difference in standard uptake values between baseline and after two NAC cycles.

Immediately after CT scanning, a PET emission scan that
covered the identical transverse field of view was obtained.
Acquisition time was 2–3 min per table position. PET image
data sets were reconstructed iteratively by applying the CT
data for attenuation correction, and co-registered images were
displayed on a workstation.
The baseline 18FDG PET/CT scans were scheduled
prior to initiation of neoadjuvant therapy, at least ten days
after core biopsy. The second scans were scheduled after the
completion of the second cycle of neoadjuvant therapy just
before commencing the third cycle. The same acquisition
parameters were used for baseline and halfway studies.
All the patients’ PET examinations were done at the same
center with the same equipment and methods. The PET/CT
data was interpreted by two nuclear physicians blinded to
clinical, radiologic, and pathologic findings.

PET/CT, and the hottest spot in the tumor foci was noted
as the peak values of SUV (SUVpeak). After evidence of
the initial 18FDG hyper-metabolism subsided on the PET/
CT acquisition during neoadjuvant therapy, the VOI was
copied onto the images of the second scans. The lesion
with the highest initial uptake was assessed. The ALN
to evaluate was defined as that having the most intense
activity (SUVpeak ≥ 2.5) in the axilla [21]. Relative
changes in SUVpeak between two PET/CTs (∆SUVpeak)
were calculated according to the following formula:
∆SUVpeak = [(SUVpeak of second PET/CT –
SUVpeak of baseline PET/CT) / SUVpeak of baseline
PET/CT] × 100%.

Image analysis

Breast cancer diagnosis was performed via core-needle
biopsy. Tumor grade was determined using the modified
Scarff-Bloom-Richardson classification. Estrogen receptor
(ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 status was
determined on representative paraffin sections from each
tumor using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. ER and
PR expression was considered positive if the number of
positive nuclei was > 1%. Cytoplasmic staining was not

evaluated for consistency with the literature [22]. Positivity
for the HER2 protein was evaluated according to the criteria
of the HercepTest [22, 23]. The HER2 membrane staining
intensity and pattern were evaluated using the 0 to 3+ scale.
Scores of 0 and 1+ (weak immunostaining in less than
10% of tumor cells) were defined as negative (HER2[–]),
2+ (complete membrane staining in at least 10%, but less
than 30%, of tumor cells) as equivocal, and 3+ (uniformly
intense membrane staining in at least 30% of tumor cells)
as positive (HER2[+]). Tumors with IHC scores of 3+ and
tumors with 2+ that were further tested by fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) were reclassified as HER2(+) . Tumors
with IHC scores of 0 or 1+ and tumors with IHC scores of 2+
that were FISH-negative were classified as HER2(–).
Using IHC, the tumors were further classified into
three subtypes:
•	 Luminal: ER and/or PR positive, HER2(–) or HER2(+)
(n = 39).
•	 HER2(+): ER and PR negative, HER2(+), (n = 23).
•	 TNBC: ER, PR, and HER2(–) (n = 13).
Different therapeutic regimens were administered
according to subtypes and HER2 status:
•	 HER2(+) group: Luminal with HER2(3+) or HER2(2+)
that were FISH-positive and HER2-positive (n = 34).
For HER2-positive patients, four weekly cycles of
paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 and carboplatin at AUC of 2 in
combination with trastuzumab 2 mg/kg (on days 1, 8,
15, and 22; loading dose 4 mg/kg for week 1) were
administered, and ALN dissection was performed less
than 4 weeks after the last cycle of chemotherapy.
•	 HER2(–) group: Luminal with HER2(0), HER2(1+),
or HER(2+) that were FISH negative and TNBC (n
= 41). Patients with HER2-negative breast cancer received four weekly cycles (12 doses over 16 weeks)
of paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 and carboplatin at AUC of 2
(both on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle) followed
by ALN dissection surgery.
