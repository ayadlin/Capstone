ABSTRACT
Arginine starvation has the potential to selectively treat both primary tumor
and (micro) metastatic tissue with very low side effects. Arginine deiminase (ADI;
EC 3.5.3.6), an arginine-degrading enzyme, has been studied as a potential antitumor drug for the treatment of arginine-auxotrophic tumors. Though ADI-PEG20
(pegylated ADI by PEG 20,000) already passed the phase I/II clinical trials [1], it is
just used as adjuvant therapy because of its low efficiency and less targeting. Then,
this paper discussed the efficiency of arginine starvation mediated by ADI expressed
in cytoplasm for liver cancers. In order to guarantee the tumor targeting, human
telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter was used to drive the expression
of ADI in vivo. To access the anti-tumor efficiency of ADI, p53 gene was used as the
positive control. Thus, ADI displayed obvious cytotoxicity to BEL7402 and HUH7 cell
lines in cytoplasm. The apoptosis rates rose from 15% to nearly 60% after changing
the expression vectors from pcDNA4 plasmid to adenovirus. Compared with p53adenovirus, ADI-adenovirus showed the higher oncolytic activity in the intratumoral
injection model of mice. Tumor disappeared after the treatment of ADI-adenovirus
for two weeks, and the mice pulled through all. Therefore, ADI is an ideal anti-tumor
gene for caner targeting therapy with the help of hTERT promoter.

toxicity, advances in approaches for manipulating DNA
expression and delivery in a target-specific manner [3].
Cancer has already become one of the major disease
targets for gene therapy over the past decades. However,
there are still some impediments to intervene cancer
therapeutic effects, such as correct choice of optimal
cancer-suppressing gene, precise utility of efficacious
doses, potential toxicity from the overexpress of
endogenous therapeutic gene, and so on.
ADI is a potential cancer therapy agent for the
treatment of arginine-auxotrophic tumors, such as

INTRODUCTION
Cancer is the most common cause of death in the
world, which is a group of diseases involving uncontrolled
growth and spread of abnormal cells. Cancer gene therapy
is the method to introduce therapeutic genes into cancer
cells for the treatment of cancer. As a consequence, there
have been over 1800 clinical trials of gene therapy already
conducted or currently ongoing worldwide [2] with an
increased understanding of the genetic basic of many
diseases, improvement of vectors to minimize unwanted

hepatocellular carcinomas and melanomas [4]. ADI
originally derived from Mycoplasma bacteria, has high
immunogenicity that could limit its clinical utility. But
Phase I trial indicated that ADI-PEG20 just had reasonable
toxicity in combination with docetaxel [5]. So ADI-PEG20
is used as an effective anticancer medicine. However, ADI
needs 4 days to make tumor cells apoptosis [6]. Compared
with tumor targeting medicines, its tumor-suppressing
efficiency is a little bit lower.
Our group adopted a new strategy to improve
the tumor-suppressing efficiency of ADI. ADI was
expressed directly in tumor cells to exhaust endogenous
and exogenous arginine. As an exogenous protein, the
enzyme activity of ADI expressed in cytoplasm will not be
interrupted theoretically by any other intracellular factors
through interaction or competitive inhibition. Hence, the
tumor-suppressing efficiency of ADI will be improved
quickly and directly. Compared with other gene delivery
systems, adenovirus was chosen as the gene-transfer
vector because of its virtues [7]. In order to enhance the
tumor-targeting ability of ADI, hTERT promoter was
used to replace the CMV promoter in adenovirus vector
and drive the expression of ADI in cancer cells. In this
paper, we discussed the activity of hTERT promoter in
the different cancer cells. What’s more, we investigated
the tumor-suppressing efficiency of ADI expressed in
cytoplasm as an exogenous gene.

Then we checked the fluorescence of the cell-lines on an
inverted fluorescence microscope after 48h cell-cultured
time. As shown in Figure 1C, there wasn’t the green
fluorescence in two normal cell-lines, L-02 and RWPE-1.
But other four positive cell-lines emitted the strong green
fluorescence. The expression results of EGFP protein in
Figure 1B corresponded to the fluorescence results in
Figure 1C. There weren’t the expressions of EGFP protein
in L-02 and RWPE-1 cell lines under the regulation of the
phTERT promoter. 293T, PC3, HUH7 and BEL7402 cell
lines displayed the obvious expressions of EGFP protein.
Compared with pCMV promoter in the pEGFP-N1vector,
phTERT promoter has the relative lower transcription
efficiency which resulted in the relative weaker
fluorescence of the cell lines. These results indicated
that the exogenous phTERT promoter didn’t present the
enough efficiency though it could effectively launch the
expression of EGFP protein in the cancer cells maintaining
the high activity of endogenous hTERT promoter.
It is an effective way to add a suitable enhancer at
the 5’-end of phTERT promoter in order to improve the
activity of phTERT promoter. We chose the enhancer of
pCMV promoter after investigating several enhancers
[11, 12]. phTERTe promoter was synthesized, including
the pCMV enhancer and phTERT promoter. phTERTepEGFP-N1 plasmid was constructed and transfected
into cell-lines. As shown in (Figure 1D, 1E and 1F),
phTERTe promoter resulted in the stronger fluorescence
and the higher expression of EGFP protein than phTERT
promoter, but still was relative weaker than pCMV
promoter. In addition to the tumor-targeting specialty, the
activity of phTERTe promoter is enough to ensure the
moderate expression of cancer suppressor genes in cancer
cells. Therefore, phTERTe promoter is an ideal promoter
for cancer gene therapy.

RESULTS
The activity assay of the endogenous hTERT
promoter in the different cell lines
The activity of phTERT promoter was verified in
different cell lines. The cell lines were chosen according
to the results from the luciferase report gene driven by
phTERT promoter [8–10]. Some cell lines possessing
the higher activity of endogenous hTERT promoter
were selected for further tests. The expression levels of
endogenous hTERT protein were detected by fluorescence
quantitative real-time PCR in different cell lines. The
mRNA of hTERT gene was used as PCR target. As
shown in Figure 1A, the mRNA levels of hTERT gene
were lower in the cell-lines of A549, Hela, L-02, H7721,
HepG2 and SK-hep1, which indicated that hTERT protein
was not expressed in all of the cancer cells. But several
cell-lines still possess the higher level of hTERT obviously
as shown in Figure 1A, such as 293T, BEL7402, PC3,
HUH7. Therefore, these four cell-lines were used to test
the activity of exogenous phTERT promoter.
GFP gene is an ideal report gene for testing the
activity of exogenous promoters. The vector of pEGFP-N1
was chosen for the tests. pCMV promoter was replaced by
phTERT promoter in the pEGFP-N1vector. The restriction
enzymes, Ase I and Bgl II, were used as the cutting sites.
New constructed plasmid, phTERT-pEGFP-N1, was
transfected into endogenous phTERT-positive cell-lines.

Tumor-targeting effects and cytotoxicity assay of
ADI expression plasmid driven by phTERTe
ADI gene is an unexceptionable tumor-targeting
gene for cancer gene therapy. To test its cytotoxicity for
tumor cells and normal cells, we transferred ADI gene into
different cell-lines to induce cell death.
Firstly, pcDNATM4/TO/myc-His vector was used as
the transfection vector. Its pCMV promoter was replaced
by phTERTe promoter. Restriction enzymes were Mlu
I and Afl II. ADI gene and p53 gene were inserted into
its multiple cloning sites. Its c-myc tag was kept and
fused with the fragments inserted. Cloning details were
displayed in Table 1. p53 gene is known as an effective
tumor suppressor gene [13], which has been researched
for nearly 30 years [14]. p53 gene was used as the positive
control.
Secondly, having built and verified the hepatic
cancer cell model, we just focused on the hepatoma
cytotoxicity of ADI. Then new constructed plasmids,
phTERTe-pcDNA4-ADI-cmyc and phTERTe-pcDNA437695

Oncotarget

p53-cmyc, were transfected into L-02, BEL7402 and
HUH7 cell-lines. After 48h of cell culture time, cell
apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometer. At the same
time, 10 mIU/ml−1 ADI-PEG20 [1, 5] were used as
the positive control. As shown in Figure 2A and 2B,
BEL7402 cell-line displayed about 15% of apoptosis
rate after induced by ADI and p53. HUH7 cell-line
got almost 12% of apoptosis rate. L-02 cell line as the
negative control only had nearly 6% of apoptosis rate.
Thus it can be seen that ADI gene also has the ability
to induce the cell apoptosis as p53 gene. By contrast,
the apoptosis rate induced by ADI-PEG20 was only
about 10% in BEL7402 and HUH7 cell lines, which
was lower than the rates aroused by the cytoplasmexpressed ADI. Then, the cytoplasm-expressed ADI
possessed the higher cytotoxicity against the hepatoma
cells. But due to the different activity of phTERTe
promoter in the different cell-lines, BEL7402 cell-line
had the highest expression level of ADI and p53 protein
(as shown in Figure 2C) which directly led to its highest
apoptosis rate.

Based on above results, we can see that ADI gene
is a significant anticancer gene for cancer gene therapy,
which can successfully induce cell death and presented
lower cytotoxicity on normal cell-line L-02 as shown
in Figure 2A and 2B. The tumor-targeting efficiency of
phTERTe promoter is also very excellent. L-02 cell line as
the normal cell control didn’t almost have cell death. But
expression quantity and time were not so ideal. It follows
that expression plasmid is not a good expression vector in
vivo because its expression efficiency will be determined
by its transfection efficiency.

Tumor-targeting effects and cytotoxicity assay of
ADI-adenovirus driven by phTERTe promoter
Adenovirus has been developed into very excellent
vectors for gene therapy in the past few years. As the
fifth generation adenovirus vector, pacAd5/CMV/K-N/
pA vector has many advantages, such as easy operation,
easy modification, high transfection rate, high expression,
and so on. So it was used as our gene therapy vector.

Plasmids were named as the type of promoter(p)-vector-gene-tag.

Firstly, pCMV promoter was replaced by phTERTe
promoter in pacAd5/CMV/K-N/pA vector. Sbf I and
Kpn I were used in phTERTe-Ad5 plasmid construction.
Secondly, ADI-cmyc gene fragment was amplified
from phTERTe-pcDNA4-ADI-cmyc plasmid and was
inserted into multiple cloning site of phTERTe-Ad5
plasmid. Then, phTERTe-Ad5-ADI-cmyc plasmid was
constructed successfully. phTERTe-Ad5-p53-cmyc was
also constructed as the positive control in the same way.
Thirdly, the recombinant adenoviruses were packaged out
and were used to infect tumor cells. The apoptosis results
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

from flow cytometry were shown in Figure 3A and 3B.
ADI-adenovirus was more efficient than ADI plasmid to
induce cancer cell death. It was only 48h that death rate
raised to nearly 60% in BEL7402 and HUH7 cell-lines.
But L-02 cell-line also had approximate 30% of death rate,
which implied that ADI-adenovirus is also toxic to normal
cells. But the toxicity for normal cells should be resulted
from adenovirus itself, not from ADI gene, because there
was no big difference of apoptosis rates between ADI/
p53-adenovirus-treated L-02 cells and empty adenovirustreated L-02 cells.

Oncolytic efficiency of ADI-adenovirus driven by
phTERTe promoter

Therefore, it can be concluded that ADI-adenovirus
has very strong oncolytic activity. The strange thing is
that the oncolytic activity of ADI-adenovirus is higher
than one of p53-adenovirus, but their cancer cytotoxicity
is almost same. Then, we took out the tumors treated for
six days to check the expression of exogenous proteins
by immunohistochemistry. As the HE-dyed results shown
in Figure 5A, the tumor cells treated by ADI- or p53adenovirus became atrophic and sparse. There were more
red-dyed areas between the ADI-treated cells, which
suggested that a large amount of cytoplasm was released
from dead cells. As the immunohistochemistry results
shown in Figure 5A and 5C, the expression of ADI was
higher than that of p53. ADI expressed in cytoplasm
quickly led to the death of the tumor cells. Large amounts
of ADI were released into tumor microenvironments and
made the tumors vesiculate inside.
Some pathological phenomenon was observed
during the injection of virus, such as spasm, shiver,
apocleisis, and so on. These symptoms were very obvious
during the initial eight days. The pus was found to exude
from the injection position at the surface of the tumors in
this period. Then, we always helped to extrude all of the
pus before the next injection. The mice started to recover
after the treatment for eight days. The mice began to drink
and eat, and not to cramp or shiver any more.

The animal model was constructed by injecting
BEL7402 cell-line into the mice. BEL7402 cell-line is
an ideal cell-line for our cancer-model based on its high
activity of endogenous hTERT promoter. Another reason
is that the wild type p53 and myc protein [15, 16] are less
expressed in BEL7402 cell-line. So we can use the c-myc
tag to detect the expression of ADI and p53 proteins, then
compare their oncolytic efficiency in the mice model.
BEL7402 cells were injected into the right
subcutaneous axillary of each mouse to form tumors.
When palpable tumors developed into almost 50 mm3,
recombinant adenoviruses were injected into the tumors.
As shown in Figure 4A, Tumors dismissed completely
after treated by ADI-adenovirus for two weeks. The
tumors treated by p53-adenovirus just decreased the
sizes, not disappeared thoroughly. The sizes of negative
control tumors were almost the same as the sizes before
the injection of empty-adenovirus. What really interested
us was that the tumor sizes reduced faster when the mice
were treated by ADI-adenovirus for eight days, as shown
in Figure 4B. The tumors from other mice reduced their
sizes very slowly. The weight of mice also decreased
very faster when treated by ADI-adenovirus. But after the
injection of ADI-adenovirus for 6 days, the mice weight
increased faster than others as shown in Figure 4C.

DISCUSSION

T cell receptor and permit targeting of T cells towards
virtually any tumor [21]. In contrast to donor T cells,
CAR-engineered NK cells possess higher cytotoxicity
against resistant cancer cells and made more achievements
in clinical trials [22]. However, cellular immune therapy
still has some scientific and clinical problems to be
resolved, such as dangerously high fevers and precipitous
drops in blood pressure caused by cytokine-release
syndrome, lower activity of immune cells separated from
the blood of old patients, short-term persistence leaded by
too expensive cellular therapy price and lower cell dosage
[23].
In October 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approved the first oncolytic virus therapy
to treat melanoma. The virus used in the treatment is
called talimogene laherparepvec (Imlygic), or T-VEC [24].
Oncolytic virus therapy is a new type of immunotherapy
that uses genetically modified viruses to only kill cancer
cells except healthy cells [25]. The viruses are injected
into the tumors and make copies of itself in cancer cells.
As a result, the cancer cells burst and die, then release
cancer antigens. This triggers the patient’s immune system
to launch an attack on all cancers cells in the body [26].
We constructed our oncolytic virus in a different
way. Our oncolytic virus relies on transferring tumor
suppressor gene to kills cancer cells, then makes cancer
cells burst and release cancer antigens. Adenovirus vector
pacAd5 from Cell Biolabs Inc was chosen as our gene-

Compared with radiotherapy and chemotherapy,
cancer gene therapy is accepted by more and more
clinicians and patients, which highly become the trend of
cancer therapy. The rapidly development of gene therapy
arouses a number of innovative treatments for cancer
patients. The genetic modification of cancer and immune
cells led to numerous successful clinical trials. The use
of oncolytic virus and bacteria already obtained several
impressive products. But some of the key scientific and
regulatory issues still existed in clinical trials, including
tumor targeting, safety of transgene vectors, long-term
persistence, necessity of integrating into genome, shedding
of a virus, immunogenicity of a virus, and so on.
Tumor targeting was the most important factor for
gene therapy medicines. Targeted cell immunotherapy
will become the future to fight against cancers [17].
Donor nature killer (NK) cell therapy for cancers made
very little achievements in clinic due to its poor in vivo
survival and lack of specificity [18]. Donor cytokineinduced killer (CIK) cell therapy also couldn’t eliminate
tumors efficiently without combination therapy with
chemotherapy in clinic because it had no tumor targeting
[19]. However, CAR-T cell is driving the road from
laboratory to the clinic [20]. Chimeric antigen receptors
(CARs) endow T cell populations with defined antigen
specificities that function independently of the natural

transferred vector, based on Adenovirus advantages in
clinical trials. Adenoviruses are well studied and can be
grown into high titer stocks. They can infect different
body tissues and be maintained in vivo as an episome [27].
More than 400 gene therapy trials have been or are being
conducted with human adenovirus vectors [28]. Most of
these trials are for treatment of cancers. Nearly all clinical
trials have indicated that adenovirus vectors are safe and
well tolerated [28].
We applied two strategies to keep the tumor
targeting of our oncolytic virus. One was the utility of
phTERT promoter, and the other was the utility of ADI
gene. hTERT protein has been identified as a major protein
involved in aberrant cell proliferation, immortalization,
metastasis and stemness maintenance in a majority of
tumors, yet it has little or no expression in the normal
somatic cells, which makes hTERT promotor become an
ideal regulatory element in cancer gene therapy [29]. Over
past decades, the therapies based on phTERT promoter
such as soft tissue sarcoma [30], leukemia [31], urothelial
cancer [32], have developed to be critical and specific for
eradicating all types of cancer [33]. Meanwhile, ADIPEG20 as a potential antineoplastic drug already passed
the phase I/II clinical trials [1, 5]. Many tumors need take
the arginine from microenvironment due to the deficiency

of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS). ADI protein can
use up the arginine in the tumor microenvironment, then
leads the tumors to the starvation. But the normal tissues
will not be affected because of the presence of ASS in
the normal tissue cells [34]. However, ADI protein doesn’t
possess the enough efficiency to starve tumor cells to die
fast, which needs 4 days to make tumor cells apoptosis
[6, 35].
In order to improve the anti-tumor efficiency of ADI
protein, we tried to express ADI protein in the tumor cells
transferred by adenovirus. Compared with p53 gene, ADI
gene regulated by phTERT promoter displayed stronger
oncolytic activity in the mice model as shown in Figure 4
and 5. So we inferred that, ADI protein expressed in vivo,
as an exogenous protein, will not theoretically be limited
by interaction with other intercellular factors. ADI protein
can keep the high efficiency to maintain its tumor-targeting
specificity in tumor cells. However, p53 protein as an
endogenous protein, has too many interactions with other
intercellular proteins in vivo, which decreases the antitumor activity of p53. Moreover, p53 has no selectivity
to induce the apoptosis of cancer cells or normal cells.
Therefore, ADI gene is an ideal anti-tumor gene for cancer
gene therapy.

We had also tried to delivered ADI-adenovirus by
both intravenous and intraperitoneal injection. To our
disappointment, the injected mice appeared serious spasm
and shiver symptoms both. The injected mice started to die
after four days of intravenous or intraperitoneal injection.
Obviously, this ADI-adenovirus was not fit for intravenous
or intraperitoneal injection at the current stage. There
are no tumor ligands on the surface of ADI-adenovirus,
which makes ADI-adenovirus unable to target the tumors
in blood vessel or peritoneum. On the other side, ADIadenovirus will arouse serious immunogenicity reaction as
other p53-adenovirus in clinics [36]. Therefore, our ADI-

adenovirus is more suit for the intratumoral injection in
cancer gene therapy.
Therapeutic schemes of cancers will be determined
based on a patient’s tumor specifics, genetics, host immune
status, and so on [37]. Hybrid tumor treatments will make
cancer a manageable disease [2]. Our ADI-adenovirus
doesn’t possess the replicating ability in other tissue cells,
which will decrease its side-effects in clinic. Our ADIadenovirus will be suited to treat the tumors which can’t be
executed by surgery. Perhaps, a suitable schedule of virus
injection will be helpful to melt those tumors in clinic,
which still needs be verified by vast quantities of animal

ADI-adenovirus, it may be used alone or in combination
with other current treatments.
Right now, the apoptosis mechanism induced by
ADI expressed in the cells is studying in our research
group. Next stage, we will describe the molecular details
of cell dysfunction aroused by arginine starvation.

performed using the CsCl gradient centrifugation. Titers
of recombinant virus were determined by TCID50 (Tissue
culture infective dose).

Quantitative PCR analysis for the endogenous
hTERT
The expression of endogenous hTERT protein
was assayed by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Briefly, total
RNA for each cell line was extracted using TRIzol (Life
Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
for monolayer cells in a 6-well plate format. Reverse
transcription was performed from 3 μg total RNA using
oligo(dT) and RevertAid Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo
Scientific) according to the supplier’s instructions.
Quantitative PCR was performed with SuperReal PreMix
SYBR Green (TIANGEN) using an Applied Biosystems
7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies).
2-ΔΔCt in relative quantification analysis method was used
to calculate the change fold of hTERT mRNA among
the different cell lines. PCR primers included (5′ to 3′)
hTERTsense (CGTACAGGTTTCACGCATGTG) and
hTERTantisense (ATGACGCGCAGGAAAAATG).

epithelioid carcinoma), A549 (from human Caucasian
lung carcinoma), HepG2 (from human hepatocellular
carcinoma), 293T (from human embryonic kidney),
BEL7402 (from human hepatocellular carcinoma), H7721
(from human hepatocellular carcinoma), SK-Hep1 (from
human endothelial hepatocellular carcinoma) and HUH7
(from human hepatocellular carcinoma). The adenovirus
proliferation cell line 293 was grown in DMEM medium
supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100
μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine. All cells
were cultured in a humidified atmosphere containing 5%
CO2 at 37°C. All culture reagents were purchased from
Life Technologies LLC.

phTERT promoter activity assays
The resulting GFP reporter vectors, phTERTpEGFP-N1 and phTERTe-pEGFP-N1, were transfected
with lipo2000 (invitrogen) into individual tumor cell lines
followed by GFP analysis. Briefly, GFP activity Detection
by fluorescence microscope was normalized to the activity
of phTERT promoter after 24-28h. Western blot analysis
was processed to verify the expression level of GFP
protein at the same time.

Plasmid construction and generation of
phTERT-Ad5-ADI
The core promoter of hTERT gene was synthesized
by Genscript LIC, which contained 284bp from -279 to
5 (numbered from start code ATG). The core promoter
of hTERT gene was named as phTERT promoter here.
phTERT promoter was inserted into pEGFP-N1 vector
to replace the whole pCMV promoter. New plasmid
was called phTERT-pEGFP-N1. An enhanced phTERT
promoter named phTERTe promoter was also synthesized,
which included the enhancer of pCMV and phTERT
promoter. Other plasmids were constructed in the same
way, such as phTERTe-pEGFP-N1, phTERTe-pcDNA4ADI-cmyc, phTERTe-pcDNA4-p53-cmyc, phTERTeAd5-ADI-cmyc, phTERTe-Ad5-p53-cmyc, and so on.
Thereinto, pcDNATM4/TO/myc-His vector and pacAd5/
CMV/K-N/pA vector were used for constructing above
plasmids. Table 1 displayed all of the information about
the plasmid construction including restriction enzymes
and primers.
The shuttle plasmids of recombinant Ad5 were cotransfected into 293A cells with adenovirus backbone
plasmid pacAd5 from Cell Biolabs INC. The recombinant
adenoviruses were packaged out by homologous
recombination in the cell. Purification of the virus was

Western blot analysis
Five micrograms of protein were electrophoresed
in 10% SDS-PAGE gels and blotted to polyvinylidine
difluoride membranes. Specific primary antibodies
(ProteinTech Group Inc.) were detected with peroxidaselabeled secondary antibodies (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ)
using SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate
(Pierce Chemical) per manufacturer’s instructions.

Determination of apoptosis by flow cytometry
The extent of apoptosis was determined by the
flow cytometric measurement through Annexin V-FITC
apoptosis detection kit (Beyotime, China). Cells were
divided into untreated, p53-adnovirus--treated, and
ADI-adenovirus-treated groups. After 48 h, cells were
harvested and washed twice with PBS. Then, cells were
stained in 1 mL Annexin V binding buffer with 10 μL of PI
solution and 5 μL of Annexin V-FITC for 10 min at room
temperature and analyzed by flow cytometry.

China.

For the intratumoral injection model, 5 ×106 of
BEL7402 cells were inoculated into the hind flank of
4-week-old male Kunming mice. BEL7402 cells were
digested from the culture plates by the trypsin, and then
diluted into 3×106/ml after trypan blue staining and
microscopic count. 0.2 ml of cells was injected into the
right subcutaneous axillary of each mouse. The soya-bean
size tumors grew up after 1-3 weeks. What’s more, the
tumors didn’t subside during the rest life of mice. So the
heap-tumor model was established successfully.
When palpable tumors developed into almost 50
mm3, mice were randomly divided into three groups.
Each group had 6 mice and was injected with one kind
of adenovirus, such as ADI-adenovirus, p53-adenovirus
and blank adenovirus. Adenovirus titer was l×109 pfu/
ml. 100ul virus was injected into tumors every two days.
Tumor’s sizes and mice weights were measured at the
same time.

Immunohistochemistry
Tumors were taken away from mice and made
into paraffin sections. Sections were treated as the usual
procedures. After deparaffinized, dehydrated, inactivated
and blocked, sections were processed with hematoxylineosin staining (HE staining) firstly. Hematoxylin was
used to show the nuclear morphology. Eosin was used to
stain cytoplasm. Then, immunohistochemistry staining
was carried out with anti-MYC tag (mouse monoclonal
antibody IgG1a, CA: BM0238, BOSTER LTD, Wuhan,
China.) (dilution 1:100) to detect the expression
of exogenous proteins transferred by adenovirus.
Diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) was
developed to show the yellow color. Hematoxylin was also
utilized to stain cellular nucleus.
