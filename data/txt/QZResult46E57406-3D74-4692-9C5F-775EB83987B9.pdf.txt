Abstract
Aberrant expression of B-tubulin isotypes is frequently
described in tumor tissues and tubulin-binding agent
(TBA)–resistant cell lines. There is limited understanding of
the role of specific B-tubulin isotypes in cellular sensitivity to
TBAs, and to gain insights into the functional role of BII- and
BIVb-tubulin, we examined these isotypes in lung cancer cell
lines NCI-H460 (H460) and Calu-6. Drug-treated clonogenic
assays revealed that small interfering RNA–mediated knockdown of either BII- or BIVb-tubulin hypersensitized the lung
cancer cell lines to Vinca alkaloids, with the effects more
pronounced following BIVb-tubulin knockdown. In contrast,
there was no change in paclitaxel sensitivity following
knockdown of either isotype. Cell cycle analysis revealed a
greater propensity for the BII- and BIVb-tubulin knockdown
cells to undergo G2-M cell cycle block following 5 nmol/L
vincristine treatment, with the BIVb knockdown cells being
more sensitive than the BII-tubulin knockdown cells compared with control. In contrast to BII-tubulin knockdown,
BIVb-tubulin knockdown cells showed a significant increase in
the sub-G1 population (cell death) following treatment with
both 5 and 40 nmol/L of vincristine compared with controls.
Importantly, BIVb-tubulin knockdown in H460 cells caused a
significant dose-dependent increase in Annexin V staining in
response to vincristine but not paclitaxel. Therefore, increased
sensitivity to induction of apoptosis is one mechanism
underlying the Vinca alkaloid hypersensitivity. This study
provides direct evidence that BII- or BIVb-tubulins have
functionally distinct roles and expression of these isotypes
may serve as strong predictors of Vinca alkaloid response and
resistance. [Cancer Res 2008;68(23):9817–24]

Introduction
Tubulin-binding agents (TBA) disrupt microtubule dynamics by
binding to the h-tubulin subunit on a/h-tubulin, inducing mitotic
arrest and cell death (1). Clinically important TBAs can be
subdivided into two broad groups, microtubule-stabilizing agents
(e.g., paclitaxel, docetaxel, and epothilones) and microtubuledestabilizing agents (e.g., vincristine, vinblastine, and vinorelbine),
all of which are used to treat a range of hematologic and solid
tumors. Despite the success of TBAs in the clinic, chemoresistance
can be a significant barrier to cure. Drug resistance is multifactorial

and the development of resistance to TBAs has been associated
with increased expression of ATP-binding cassette transporters,
alterations in apoptosis pathways, and alterations in tubulin/
microtubule proteins (2, 3).
Altered expression of specific h-tubulin isotypes has been
reported in tumors and is associated with resistance to TBAs
(2, 3). Despite strong correlational evidence, the functional
significance of differential expression of h-tubulin isotypes on
microtubule morphology, cell cycle, and response to TBAs is not
well understood. The cellular target of TBAs is h-tubulin and there
are at least seven h-tubulin isotypes, encoded by multiple genes
that display tissue-specific expression. For example, hI-tubulin is
constitutively expressed in many tissues; hII-tubulin is found at
high levels in brain and low levels in various tissues; hIII-tubulin is
expressed in neurons and Sertoli cells; and hIV-tubulin consists of
two isotypes, hIVa and hIVb, with hIVa restricted to brain and
hIVb found in most tissues (4). The h-tubulin isotypes are highly
homologous and conserved across species and differ predominately in their last 15 amino acids at the COOH-terminal end (4). The
differential tissue expression and highly conserved sequences of
h-tubulin isotypes across all species suggest that each isotype may
provide unique characteristics that impart functional differences to
microtubules. The potential role of h-tubulin isotypes is supported
by evidence from in vitro studies using purified bovine brain
tubulin that showed that microtubules composed of different
tubulin isotypes contribute to differences in assembly properties,
microtubule dynamics, and drug binding (5–8). Although the
in vivo significance of this remains uncertain, inherent functional
differences among isotype classes could potentially alter the
cellular response to TBAs. Addressing this issue is of clinical
importance as it could provide a means to predict the response of
tumors to TBAs.
We have recently shown that in addition to mediating sensitivity
to diverse classes of TBAs, hIII-tubulin also mediates sensitivity to
DNA-damaging agents by behaving as a cellular survival factor (9).
Previous studies have reported altered patterns of h-tubulin isotype
expression in cell lines, which have been selected for resistance to
TBAs (reviewed in refs. 10, 11). To date, studies have largely focused
on the role of hIII-tubulin in clinical resistance to paclitaxel or
vinorelbine in epithelial tumors (reviewed in refs. 3, 12).
Nevertheless, the relevance of other non-hIII-tubulin isotypes, such
as hII- and hIVb-tubulin, in response to TBAs remains to be
determined.
Increased expression of hII-tubulin has been associated with
resistance to paclitaxel (13, 14). We have previously identified
decreased expression of a hII-tubulin isoform by two-dimensional
gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry in both vincristine- and
vinblastine-resistant leukemia cell lines, although total hII-tubulin
protein levels were unchanged (15, 16). To date, however, there is
limited functional evidence that altered hII-tubulin expression is a
major determinant of cellular sensitivity toward paclitaxel and/or

Vinca alkaloids. Stable overexpression of hII-tubulin in Chinese
hamster ovary (CHO) cells and NIH 3T3 cells did not confer
resistance to paclitaxel (17, 18). Several clinical studies have
assessed the prognostic or predictive value of hII-tubulin in breast
(19, 20) and ovarian cancer (21). In a study involving 41 advanced
breast cancer patients, hII-tubulin expression was correlated with
lower docetaxel response rates (19), whereas hII-tubulin has been
found in both normal and tumor breast tissues (20). More recent
investigations have shown that the ratio of hII/hV-tubulin gene
expression is higher in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumor
samples compared with normal lung tissues (22), suggesting that
the broad distribution of hII-tubulin in tumor tissues may
potentially suggest its relevance in disease progression and cellular
response to TBAs.
Increased expression of hIV-tubulin has also been described in
TBA-resistant cancer cell lines (14, 23–27). We have also previously
reported overexpression of hIVa-tubulin in ovarian tumors (14).
However, in many cases, there is no clear distinction between hIVaand hIVb-tubulins about their specific role in microtubule
functions and drug response, with investigation in this area being
hampered by the lack of specific antibodies to distinguish hIVaand hIVb-tubulin isotypes. Similar to hII-tubulin, overexpression of
hIVb-tubulin in CHO cells does not affect paclitaxel sensitivity (17).
Data on the contribution of hIVb-tubulin to Vinca alkaloid
response are again limited.
To understand the functional significance of hII- and hIVbtubulin isotypes in drug response, we used RNA interference (RNAi)
technology to specifically knock down the expression of these
isotypes in NSCLC cell lines and characterize the effects on
morphology, cell cycle, and drug-induced apoptosis.

treated with vincristine for 1 h at 10 nmol/L. Cells were then fixed and
processed for staining as previously described (29). Slides were viewed and
images were captured using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 Immunofluorescence
Microscope (Zeiss) fitted with a cooled charge-coupled device camera and
Image-Pro Plus 4.1 software (Media Cybernetics, L.P.).
Drug-treated clonogenic assay. Briefly, cells were transfected with
siRNA (25–100 nmol/L) for 24 h and 600 cells (Calu-6) or 150 cells (H460)
were seeded into each well of a six-well plate and allowed to attach for 4 to
6 h before drug treatment. Drug-treated clonogenic assays were performed
as previously described (9). The colonies were manually counted, and the
results were presented as a surviving fraction (9). Dose-response curves
were plotted for each drug-cell line combination and inhibitory dose (ID50)
values were extrapolated from this curve using GraphPad Prism program
(version 4; GraphPad Software). ID50 was defined as the concentration of the
drug required to reduce the number of colonies in drug-treated wells to 50%
to that of the relevant untreated controls. The ID50 values were the means of
at least three independent experiments.
Accumulation of [3H]vincristine and Annexin V-FITC staining. These
assays were performed as previously described (9).
Cell cycle analysis. Distribution of DNA content in siRNA-transfected
H460 cells was determined by flow cytometry (9). After 72 h of siRNA
transfection, cells were exposed to vincristine at the indicated concentrations for 24 h. On the day of analysis, both adherent and floating cells
were harvested, washed with PBS, and then stained with a solution
containing 0.4% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 Ag/mL propidium iodide
(Sigma-Aldrich), and 2 Ag/mL DNase-free RNase (Roche) for 15 min at 37jC
in the dark. DNA content was measured by a FACSCalibur flow cytometer
(Becton Dickinson) and analyzed using CellQuest program as described (9).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using the
GraphPad Prism program. Results were expressed as means of at least
three independent experiments F SE. A two-tailed Student’s t test was used
to determine the statistical differences between various experimental and
control groups, with P < 0.05 considered statistically significant.

Materials and Methods

Results

Cell culture and small interfering RNA transfection. Human NSCLC
cell lines Calu-6 and H460 were maintained as previously described (9).
For gene knockdown studies, cells were transfected with hII-tubulin
small interfering RNA (siRNA) ON-Target plus SMARTpool reagent
( final concentration, 25 nmol/L; Dharmacon) or hIVb-tubulin siRNA ( final
concentration, 100 nmol/L; Dharmacon) using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. All experiments
involved the use of a Lipofectamine only control (mock-transfected) and a
nonsilencing control siRNA (negative control; Qiagen) transfected at
equivalent concentrations as the target siRNA.
Cytotoxic drugs. Cytotoxic drugs were obtained as previously described
(9). Vinblastine (vinblastine sulfate; David Bull Laboratories) was prepared
at a stock concentration of 1.1 mmol/L in saline [0.9% (w/v) NaCl].
Vinflunine (kindly provided by Dr. B. Hill, Division of Experimental Cancer
Research, Pierre Fabre Research Centre, Castres, France) was solubilized in
water at a stock concentration of 2 mmol/L.
Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of B-tubulin isotypes. Total RNA
was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. RNA samples were DNase treated and reverse transcribed for
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis using methodology and
specific primers as described (14). For Hb9 (hII), H5b (hIVa), and Hb2
(hIVb) genes, semiquantitative RT-PCR–based assay involved setting up two
separate PCR tubes for target (h-tubulin) and control (h2-microglobulin)
gene sequences. PCR amplifications were performed in triplicate using two
independently prepared cDNA preparations.
Western blotting. Total cellular proteins from siRNA-transfected cells
(10 Ag) were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to
nitrocellulose membrane as described previously (28). Western blot analyses
and antibodies used have been reported previously (9).
Immunofluorescence staining. siRNA-transfected Calu-6 cells were
grown on sterile chamber slides until 60% to 70% confluent. Cells were

Specific knockdown of BII- and BIVb-tubulins in NSCLC cell
lines. To gain insight into the functional significance of hII- and
hIVb-tubulins in drug response, we used the siRNA method to
knock down their expression in two NSCLC cell lines, Calu-6 and
H460. As shown in Fig. 1A, when transfected with specific siRNA,
hII-tubulin (Hb9) mRNA expression was significantly reduced in
both cell lines at the gene level, with complete knockdown of
hIVb-tubulin (Hb2) mRNA expression observed in hIVb-tubulin
siRNA–transfected cells. At 72 hours, Western blot analysis
indicated that levels of hII-tubulin and hIV-tubulin proteins were
markedly reduced in cells transfected with siRNA against hII- or
hIVb-tubulin, respectively, but not in control siRNA–transfected
cells (Fig. 1B). The specificity of the siRNAs was shown by probing
with specific antibodies against other h-tubulin isotypes. As shown
in Fig. 1C and D, knockdown of either hII-tubulin (Fig. 1C) or
hIVb-tubulin (Fig. 1D) did not affect the endogenous levels of other
h-tubulin isotypes.
Knockdown of either BII- or BIVb-tubulin does not affect
microtubule organization but does enhance vincristineinduced microtubule depolymerization. To assess the qualitative effects of hII- and hIVb-tubulin knockdown on microtubule
organization, hII- and hIVb-tubulin siRNA–transfected cells were
stained with an antibody to a-tubulin. As shown in Supplementary
Fig. S1, neither untreated hII-tubulin nor hIVb-tubulin knockdowns showed obvious changes to microtubule morphology.
However, after incubation with 10 nmol/L vincristine for 1 hour,
both hII- and hIVb-tubulin knockdowns showed marked depolymerization of the microtubule cytoskeleton compared with the

control siRNA–treated cells. Microtubules were largely depolymerized and most of the cells were rounded with small remnants of
microtubules occasionally observed. In contrast, no gross depolymerization of the microtubules was observed in the control siRNA–
transfected cells at a comparable vincristine concentration. Thus,
although the morphology of microtubules was unchanged in both
hII- and hIVb-tubulin knockdowns in the absence of vincristine,
low concentrations of vincristine caused extensive microtubule
depolymerization in these cells compared with the controls.
Knockdown of BII- and BIVb-tubulin significantly enhances
sensitivity of NSCLC cells to Vinca alkaloids. To investigate the
effects of hII- and hIVb-tubulin knockdowns on the response of

NSCLC cells to TBAs, drug-treated clonogenic assays were
performed. Knockdown of hII-tubulin in H460 cells resulted in
significant increased sensitivity to Vinca alkaloids when compared
with mock-transfected cells as determined by its lower ID50 to
vincristine (P < 0.001; Table 1; Supplementary Fig. S2A), vinblastine
(P < 0.01; Table 1), vinflunine (P < 0.001; Table 1), and vinorelbine
(P < 0.01; Table 1). In contrast, there was no statistically significant
difference in drug sensitivity between control siRNA–transfected
cells and mock-transfected cells cultured in the presence of
these TBAs. Interestingly, knockdown of hII-tubulin did not
significantly increase paclitaxel sensitivity in H460 cells (Table 1;
Supplementary Fig. S2B). Similar results were obtained with

hII-tubulin knockdown Calu-6 cells with increased sensitivity to
vincristine (P < 0.001; Supplementary Fig. S2A; Supplementary
Table S1) but no change in paclitaxel sensitivity compared with
mock-transfected Calu-6 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B; Supplementary Table S1). The results obtained for other Vinca alkaloids
examined (including vinblastine, vinflunine, and vinorelbine)
were consistent in both NSCLC cell lines, and the results for hIItubulin knockdown in Calu-6 cells are presented in Supplementary
Table S1.
Clonogenic survival showed that knockdown of hIVb-tubulin
significantly increased the sensitivity of H460 cells to vincristine
(2.7-fold at ID50; P < 0.001) compared with mock-treated cells
(Fig. 2A; Table 1). Interestingly, the knockdown of hIVb-tubulin
expression in Calu-6 cells led to a marked drop in surviving
colonies when treated with vincristine (Fig. 2A). This represents a
9.7-fold (P < 0.001) increase in sensitivity in the ID50 concentration
compared with mock-transfected cells (Supplementary Table S1).
No significant change in sensitivity to vincristine was observed in
the control siRNA–treated cells compared with mock-treated cells
(Fig. 2A; Supplementary Table S1). Similar to hII-tubulin,
knockdown of hIVb-tubulin expression did not significantly change
paclitaxel sensitivity in these cells (Fig. 2B; Table 1 for H460 cells
and Supplementary Table S1 for Calu-6 cells). Additional Vinca
alkaloids were also tested to ascertain whether the hypersensitivity
effects observed with vincristine were specific to this agent or to
other members of this drug class. Consistent with hII-tubulin,
knockdown of hIVb-tubulin expression resulted in enhanced
sensitivity to Vinca alkaloids in H460 cells (Table 1) and Calu-6
cells (Supplementary Table S1). In summary, specific knockdown of
either hII- or hIVb-tubulin expression hypersensitized both H460
and Calu-6 cells to all Vinca alkaloids tested, with greatest
sensitization observed in the hIVb-tubulin knockdown.
Vinca alkaloid hypersensitivity is not due to increased drug
accumulation. To determine whether changes in drug accumula-

tion were contributing to drug hypersensitivity, the accumulation
of [3H]vincristine was measured in hIVb-tubulin knockdown cells.
There was no significant difference in intracellular [3H]vincristine
levels between hIVb-tubulin knockdown and controls in both Calu6 and H460 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). These results suggest that
enhanced sensitivity to vincristine in hIVb-tubulin knockdown
cells is not attributable to changes in drug accumulation.
Knockdown of BIVb-tubulin affects vincristine-induced
G2-M cell cycle arrest and enhances cell death. To determine
whether silencing of specific h-tubulin isotypes affects cell cycle
progression, cell cycle analysis was performed on hII- or hIVbtubulin knockdown H460 cells (Figs. 3 and 4, respectively).
Knockdown of hII-tubulin alone caused a small but significant
decrease in G1 ( from 62.56 F 2.07% in control to 55.64 F 1.13% in
hII-tubulin knockdown; P < 0.05; Fig. 3) and a concomitant
increase in S phase ( from 16.88 F 0.10% in control to 20.41 F
0.49% in hII-tubulin knockdown; P < 0.01; Fig. 3). In contrast, the
only variable altered in the hIVb-tubulin knockdown cells was a
small but significant increase in sub-G1 levels ( from 5.00 F 0.71%
in control to 10.60 F 1.10% in hIVb-tubulin knockdown; P < 0.05;
Fig. 4). Following 24-hour incubation with 5 nmol/L vincristine, the
hII-tubulin knockdown cells had a significantly higher G2-M
population compared with the control siRNA–treated cells
(P < 0.05; Fig. 3). Both hII-tubulin siRNA–treated and control
siRNA–treated cells had similar levels of sub-G1 content compared
with untreated samples. At the higher concentration of vincristine
(40 nmol/L), both hII-tubulin siRNA–treated and control siRNA–
treated cells showed a marked G2-M block, a hallmark effect of
TBAs. There was a small but significant increase in the G1 content
of the hII-tubulin knockdown cells. The sub-G1 content was,
however, not significantly different compared with control-treated
cells at this concentration (Fig. 3).
The hIVb-tubulin knockdown, on the other hand, had a higher
sub-G1 content when compared with the control siRNA–treated

cells at 5 nmol/L vincristine (P < 0.001; Fig. 4). The G1 population
was also significantly decreased (P < 0.001; Fig. 4) with a
concomitant increase in the G2-M population (P < 0.01; Fig. 4)
when compared with control siRNA–treated cells. A greater
difference was observed with 40 nmol/L vincristine, with the
control siRNA–treated cells showing a marked G2-M block
(P < 0.01; Fig. 4), whereas the hIVb-tubulin knockdown displays
an increase in the sub-G1 population reflective of cell death
(P < 0.05; Fig. 4). However, the extent of changes was relatively
small between 5 and 40 nmol/L vincristine, suggesting that at a
concentration as low as 5 nmol/L, knockdown of hIVb-tubulin
significantly induced a marked G2-M block and an increase in the
sub-G1 populations reflective of cell death, thereby confirming the
increase in sensitivity of these cells to vincristine.
Knockdown of BIVb-tubulin increases sensitivity of cells to
apoptosis in the presence of vincristine but not paclitaxel. The
cell cycle data suggested that knockdown of hII-tubulin expression
caused a vincristine-induced G2-M block and that hIVb-tubulin
knockdown sensitized cells to vincristine-induced cell death. To
determine if knockdown of hII- or hIVb-tubulin enhanced
apoptotic cell death, Annexin V-FITC staining was performed in
the siRNA-transfected cells following 48 hours of drug treatment.
Consistent with the cell cycle analysis, knockdown of hII-tubulin
did not significantly increase the percentage of apoptotic cells in a
dose-dependent manner in the presence of vincristine or paclitaxel

(Supplementary Fig. S4A and B ). Instead, treatment with
vincristine inhibited cell proliferation of the hII-tubulin knockdown
cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Supplementary
Fig. S4C). In contrast, paclitaxel treatment did not result in growth
inhibition of hII-tubulin knockdown cells (Supplementary
Fig. S4D). However, results presented in Fig. 5A clearly reveal that
hIVb-tubulin knockdown cells undergo vincristine-induced apoptosis at significantly higher levels than control siRNA–treated
cells in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that increased
apoptosis induction might serve as one of the mechanisms
involved in hypersensitivity to Vinca alkaloid treatment. To address
this possibility, hIVb-tubulin knockdown cells were treated with
paclitaxel followed by Annexin V-FITC staining. Consistent with the
drug-treated clonogenic data showing that levels of hIVb-tubulin
did not affect sensitivity to paclitaxel, the percentage of apoptotic
cells was comparable between the control and hIVb-tubulin
knockdown cells (Fig. 5B), suggesting that hIVb-tubulin silencing
did not enhance paclitaxel-induced apoptosis.

Discussion
Differential expression of h-tubulin isotypes in tumors may
provide unique characteristics that impart functional differences to
microtubules and mediate response to TBAs. Herein, we show for

mediate sensitivity to Vinca alkaloids but not the taxanes in NSCLC
cells. The finding that knockdown of hIVb-tubulin expression has a
marked effect on increasing Vinca sensitivity by enhancing
apoptotic cell death suggests that expression of this isotype may
serve as a strong predictor of vincristine response.
Increased expression of hII- and/or hIV-tubulin has been
described in lung (14), ovarian (14), breast (23, 27), and prostate
cancer (26) cell lines selected for resistance to a variety of TBAs,
including paclitaxel, docetaxel, and estramustine. However, detailed analysis of the role of these two isotypes in response to TBAs,
and in particular Vinca alkaloids, in cancer cells has been scarce.
Many of the above studies are correlative and there is little direct
evidence that hII- and hIVb-tubulin can affect cellular sensitivity to
TBAs. Despite a clinical correlation between increased hII-tubulin
expression and lower response rates for docetaxel in breast cancer
(19), and a higher ratio of hII/hV-tubulin in lung cancer (22), we
found that neither hII-tubulin nor hIVb-tubulin influenced
paclitaxel response in our NSCLC cell lines. In agreement, two
previous studies using stable overexpression of hII- or hIVb-tubulin
isotypes in CHO cells and the hII-tubulin isotype in NIH 3T3 cells
failed to confer resistance to paclitaxel (17, 18). Taken together,
hII- and hIVb-tubulin do not seem to play a direct role in
sensitivity and resistance to paclitaxel.
Microtubule morphology following knockdown of hII- and hIVbtubulin isotypes was not altered and is similar to the finding that
overexpression of either of these isotypes in CHO cells does not
affect microtubule morphology (17). However, on exposure to

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (23). December 1, 2008

vincristine, microtubule morphology was consistent with increased
sensitivity to microtubule disruption in both hII- and hIVb-tubulin
knockdown cells compared with control siRNA–treated cells. These
findings were subsequently validated with quantitative analysis,
where knockdown of hII- and hIVb-tubulin significantly increased
sensitivity to Vinca alkaloids (i.e., vincristine, vinblastine, vinorelbine, and vinflunine), with hIVb-tubulin knockdown exhibiting
more potent effects in the drug-treated clonogenic assays than hIItubulin. The NSCLC cells used in the current study have not been
selected for drug resistance and changes in sensitivity mediated by
specific tubulin isotypes represent changes in intrinsic sensitivity
to Vinca alkaloids and potentially predict resistance to these
agents. A potential explanation for increased sensitivity to Vinca
alkaloids is that knockdown of either hII- or hIVb-tubulin may lead
to alterations in drug-binding affinity. However, because Vinca
alkaloids (including vincristine, vinblastine, and vinorelbine) all
bind to h-tubulin isotypes with similar affinity (30, 31), it is unlikely
that alterations in drug-binding affinity due to knockdown of either
hII- or hIVb-tubulin is the underlying mechanism.
Tubulin can undergo complex autoregulation (32). To ensure the
specificity of siRNA targeting hII- and hIVb-tubulin, we confirmed
by Western blotting that knockdown was specific to each isotype
and the cells did not compensate by altering the expression of
other h-tubulin isotypes expressed in the NSCLC cells used in this
study. These findings highlight that the changes in sensitivity to
Vinca alkaloids following knockdown of either hII- or hIVb-tubulin
are specific to these isotypes. Neuronal hIVa-tubulin and

ubiquitously expressed hIVb-tubulin are encoded by the H5b and
Hb2 genes, respectively, and share a high degree of amino acid
homology (33). Although it is possible to specifically distinguish
hIVa (H5b) and hIVb (Hb2) at the gene level, there are no
commercially available antibodies to differentiate hIVa- and hIVbtubulin protein expression. We found approximately 40% to 50%
H5b gene reduction in Calu-6 cells transfected with hIVb-tubulin
siRNA (data not shown) but no significant changes in the H460
hIVb-tubulin knockdown cells. Because both cell lines showed
similar responses in drug-treated clonogenic assays, the results
obtained can be attributed to hIVb-tubulin suppression rather than
hIVa-tubulin.
Although hIVb-tubulin shares a high degree of amino acid
homology with the neuronal-specific hIVa-tubulin isotype, these
two isotypes exhibit distinct effects in drug response. In a recent
study, hIVa-tubulin overexpressing CHO cells displayed increased
sensitivity to colcemid, vinblastine, and nocodazole (34). Their
response to paclitaxel, however, changed with levels of expression
of the protein. Low hIVa-tubulin expression caused increased
sensitivity to paclitaxel (34). Whereas the level of expression
increased, the sensitivity to paclitaxel was lost (i.e., cells exhibited
normal sensitivity to paclitaxel). Overexpression of hIVb-tubulin in
the same study, however, did not affect sensitivity to colcemid,
vinblastine, and paclitaxel. In contrast, our results clearly show that
knockdown of hIVb-tubulin mediates sensitivity to all four Vinca
alkaloids tested, including vinblastine. The differences in response

to vinblastine between the two studies may be due to several
factors. The hIVb-tubulin overexpression study used CHO cells and
our study used NSCLC cells. The endogenous repertoire of tubulin
and microtubule proteins within each of these cell types is likely to
differ and may have influenced the response to vinblastine.
Modulating expression of h-tubulin may lead to compensatory
changes in other tubulin isotypes and in turn influence TBA
response. Although we addressed this possibility in the current
study, it is unclear whether this issue was examined in the hIVbtubulin overexpression study.
To address the mechanisms underlying the chemosensitivity to
Vinca alkaloids following hII- and hIVb-tubulin knockdown in
NSCLC cells, we examined the propensity of the cells to undergo
drug-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis of
h-tubulin isotype expression has previously been examined in
leukemic and sarcoma cell lines (35). Both hIVa- and hIVb-tubulin
gene levels were found to be expressed at twice the levels in
dividing cells than in resting cells. In contrast, no change in hIItubulin levels was observed. Our data showing that knockdown of
hIVb-tubulin does not markedly affect the cell cycle profile
compared with control cells suggest that expression of this isotype
may not be playing a critical role in cell division or other isotypes
may be compensating for the suppression of hIVb-tubulin. The
effects of hII- or hIVb-tubulin knockdown were most noticeable
following 24-hour vincristine treatment. At concentrations as low
as 5 nmol/L vincristine, hII-tubulin knockdown cells display
enhanced sensitivity to G2-M cell cycle arrest compared with
controls. At the concentrations and time tested, the cells were
arrested but not yet undergoing cell death. In contrast, hIVbtubulin knockdown cells were more sensitive to vincristine-induced
cell death as shown by the increased sub-G1 populations following
5 and 40 nmol/L of vincristine treatment. This finding is reflective
of their heightened sensitivity to vincristine in clonogenic assays.
Interestingly, unlike hIVb-tubulin, hII-tubulin knockdown did
not enhance apoptosis induction on exposure to vincristine at
equivalent concentrations, suggesting that these two isotypes differ
in their behavior when exposed to the drug. We found that
incubation with vincristine inhibited cell proliferation of the hIItubulin knockdown cells in a concentration-dependent manner
compared with increased apoptosis induction seen in the hIVbtubulin knockdown cells, thus potentially explaining the heightened sensitivity to Vinca alkaloids in these cells compared with the
hII-tubulin knockdown cells. Similar effects were not observed with
paclitaxel treatment (neither growth inhibition nor apoptosis
induction) following knockdown of either hII- or hIVb-tubulin.
One notable aspect of our findings is that hII- and hIVb-tubulin,
which display functionally distinct roles in drug response, are
present in relatively small amounts. Using quantitative RT-PCR,
Nicoletti and colleagues (36) showed that hI-tubulin isotype is the
most abundant (88.8%), followed by hIII (7.8%) and hIVa (2%),
with hII and hIVb representing only 1% and 0.2%, respectively,
of all h-tubulin isotypes present in H460 cells. Manipulation of the
expression of these minor isotypes produces significant changes in
Vinca alkaloid response, suggesting that they are functionally
distinct.
Microtubule function relies on the interaction of microtubules
with other cellular proteins, and thus, specific h-tubulin isotypes
may play an equally important role in modulating these
interactions. The dramatic increase in vincristine sensitivity
observed in hIVb-tubulin knockdown cells is of interest because
this isotype is constitutively expressed in low amounts in all tissues

(4). It is conceivable that differences in h-tubulin composition may
influence the interactions of microtubules with other elements of
the cytoskeletal network and hence dictate tumor cell behavior,
including the cellular response to TBAs. There is high structural
homology between the various h-tubulin isotypes and within the
Vinca-binding domain of tubulin (amino acids 175–215; ref. 37),
with hII- and hIVb-tubulin sharing 100% identity within this region
(33). Therefore, differences in cell cycle and Vinca response cannot
simply be explained by h-tubulin isotype structural differences. The
greatest diversity occurs in the COOH-terminal region of h-tubulin,
a region known to bind microtubule-associated proteins (MAP)
and interact with other cellular factors (reviewed in ref. 38). It is
possible that by decreasing specific h-tubulin isotypes, the ratio of
specific MAP binding is altered, which in turn affects the dynamic
nature of the microtubules and hence accessibility and/or efficacy
of Vinca alkaloids in cells expressing hII- or hIVb-tubulin.
Collectively, our recent demonstration that hIII-tubulin mediates
sensitivity to Vinca alkaloids and taxanes (9), and the current study
showing that knockdown of hII- and hIVb-tubulin increases
sensitivity to Vinca alkaloids but not the taxanes, proposes that
each isotype is unique in terms of drug-target interactions and
isotype composition of a cell affects its response to TBAs. The
clinical relevance of various h-tubulin isotypes is still being
unraveled. The functional significance of hII- and hIVb-tubulin in
