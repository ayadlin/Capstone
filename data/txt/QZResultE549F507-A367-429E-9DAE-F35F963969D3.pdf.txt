Enhanced Radioresponse after Coordinate Targeting of
Integrin α5β1 and Fibronectin

Abstract
Tactics to selectively enhance cancer radioresponse are of great interest. Cancer cells actively elaborate and
remodel their extracellular matrix (ECM) to aid in survival and progression. Previous work has shown that β1integrin inhibitory antibodies can enhance the growth-inhibitory and apoptotic responses of human breast
cancer cell lines to ionizing radiation, either when cells are cultured in three-dimensional laminin-rich
ECM (3D lrECM) or grown as xenografts in mice. Here, we show that a specific α heterodimer of β1-integrin
preferentially mediates a prosurvival signal in human breast cancer cells that can be specifically targeted for
therapy. 3D lrECM culture conditions were used to compare α-integrin heterodimer expression in malignant
and nonmalignant cell lines. Under these conditions, we found that expression of α5β1-integrin was upregulated in malignant cells compared with nonmalignant breast cells. Similarly, we found that normal and oncofetal splice variants of fibronectin, the primary ECM ligand of α5β1-integrin, were also strikingly upregulated
in malignant cell lines compared with nonmalignant acini. Cell treatment with a peptide that disrupts the
interactions of α5β1-integrin with fibronectin promoted apoptosis in malignant cells and further heightened
the apoptotic effects of radiation. In support of these results, an analysis of gene expression array data from
breast cancer patients revealed an association of high levels of α5-integrin expression with decreased survival.
Our findings offer preclinical validation of fibronectin and α5β1-integrin as targets for breast cancer therapy.

Introduction
Cancer cells have the ability to co-opt their microenvironment to create the necessary conditions for growth and survival by eliciting processes such as neoangiogenesis, and
actively remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM). ECM
has profound effects on cellular behavior and can facilitate
cancer progression (1). In addition, specific ECM components such as fibronectin have been associated with poor
prognosis in patients with breast cancer (2).
The primary receptors for ECM ligands are the integrins.
Integrins are a large family of heterodimeric ECM receptors
that consists of 18α and 8β subunits (3). Each individual
member of the integrin family of receptors binds multiple

ECM ligands, such as fibronectin, laminin, and collagen,
which then activate intracellular signaling pathways (3, 4).
The α subunit typically confers specificity for the ligand,
whereas the β subunit couples to the downstream signaling
pathways (3). In our previous studies, we have shown that
the three-dimensional laminin-rich ECM (3D lrECM) culture
model allows rapid discrimination between breast cancer
cells and nonmalignant epithelial cells, which undergo acinar
development in 3D lrECM, but not two-dimensional cultures
(5). We applied this model to show that β1-integrin inhibitory antibody, AIIB2, leads to selective apoptosis and decreases
proliferation in human breast cancer cells in 3D lrECM and
in vivo (6) without toxicity to normal tissues. In addition, we
found that combining β1-integrin inhibition with ionizing radiation (IR) allowed for the reduction of IR dose necessary to
achieve growth inhibition in vivo.
The present study addresses whether a specific β1-integrin
heterodimer is more potent in prosurvival signaling in cancer
compared with normal cells and whether this could be more
specifically targeted. Although β1-integrin and its downstream signaling have been implicated in resistance to IR
(7–9), specific α subunit partners of β1-integrin and the molecular mechanisms involved in survival signaling after IR have
not been fully investigated.
In this study, we show that α5β1-integrin is a major β1
heterodimer that is upregulated in 3D lrECM and after IR exposure in malignant T4-2 and other breast cancer cells. We

α5β1-Integrin and Fibronectin Targeting in Breast Cancer

found that its preferred ECM ligand, fibronectin, is also dramatically upregulated, coincident with the increase in α5β1integrin. In addition, several malignant cell lines in 3D lrECM
preferentially upregulate protein of the fibronectin splice variant, EDA+, compared with nonmalignant cells. Demonstrative of its therapeutic potential, inhibition of α5-integrin and
fibronectin interaction by ATN-161 (Ac-PHSCN-NH2) induces
apoptosis and enhances IR efficacy in T4-2 and MDA-MB-231
malignant breast cancer cell lines. Finally, we found that high
α5-integrin gene expression is associated with decreased survival, providing a potential clinical context for α5β1-integrin
inhibition for therapy.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
HMT-3522 mammary epithelial cells were originally derived from a woman with fibrocystic breast disease and were
propagated as described in the Supplementary Data. HMT3522-T4-2 wild-type cells that were either stably transfected
with a constitutively active myristoylated Akt (T4-2 myr-Akt)
or empty vector control (T4-2 vc) were previously described
(10). 3D lrECM cultures consisted of cells trypsinized from
monolayer cultures and plated on top of commercially available growth factor–reduced Basement Membrane Extract
(Trevigen) as previously described (6, 11). Cultures were treated with ATN-161 or ATN-163 (kind gifts from Dr. Andrew
Mazar, Attenuon, San Diego, CA) or anti–α5-integrin antibodies on day 4 of culture for malignant cell lines. All cultures were analyzed 72 hours after the first treatment.
Real-time PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted using NucleoSpin RNA II
(Macherey-Nagel). cDNA was synthesized with the SuperScript
first-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen) from 0.5 to 1.0 μg RNA.
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed with the
LightCycler System using LightCycler FastStart DNA Master
SYBR GreenI (Roche). The primers, the protocol used to amplify total fibronectin and EDA+ fibronectin, and 18S rRNA
are described in the Supplementary Data.
Cell surface labeling
After releasing cells from 3D lrECM, cell colonies were incubated with 0.2 mg/mL sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (ThermoScientific) in PBS for 30 minutes at 4°C, and then the supernatant
was replaced with 50 mmol/L glycine/PBS for 15 minutes at
4°C. After washing, cell pellets were lysed in 1% radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. Cell lysates were subjected to
immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE using nonreducing
conditions and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Proteins labeled on the cell surface were detected
with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate
(GE Healthcare) at a 1:500 dilution.
Survival analysis
A gene expression data set including the microarray profiles of 295 human breast cancers and the associated clinical
data (12) was obtained from Rosetta Inpharmatics. All pa-

tients had stage I or II breast cancer and were younger than
53 years (12). Among the 295 patients, 151 patients had
lymph node–negative disease and 144 had lymph node–
positive disease (12). For survival analysis, patients were
stratified into upper, lower, and interquartiles for the expression of ITGA5. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were calculated
and shown using SigmaPlot (version 11.0). Statistical significance was determined by the log-rank test; a P value of <0.05
was considered statistically significant.
Statistical analysis
Results referred to in the remaining text, in Figs. 1 through

<0.05 were considered significant. Significant differences are
indicated by * for P < 0.05, ** for P < 0.01, *** for P < 0.001, and

Lysis from 3D lrECM, immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, immunostaining, apoptosis assay, Akt kinase assay, and
antibodies are described in the Supplementary Data.

Results
α5β1-Integrin heterodimers are strikingly upregulated
in malignant T4-2 cells compared with nonmalignant
S1 cells in 3D lrECM
We have shown previously that β1-integrins are important
potential targets for cancer therapy alone and in combination with IR (6, 13). However, whether a specific β1-integrin
heterodimer preferentially mediates tumor survival and/or
resistance to radiation is not known. To investigate which
β1-integrin heterodimer plays a dominant role in malignant
breast cells, we compared the expression level of several
α-integrin subunits between malignant T4-2 cells and their
nonmalignant counterpart, S1 cells. We found that the α5integrin subunit was dramatically upregulated in T4-2 compared with S1 cells in 3D lrECM (Fig. 1A). We also confirmed
that the α5β1-integrin complex is upregulated by the
immunoprecipitation of β1-integrins (Fig. 1B) Interestingly,
α5-integrin expression was significantly higher in T4-2 cells
compared with S1 cells only in 3D lrECM cultures, but not on
two-dimensional tissue culture plastic (two-dimensional data
not shown).
Elevated α5-integrin gene expression is associated with
significantly decreased long-term survival in patients
with breast cancer
We previously showed that high β1-integrin and fibronectin expression detected by immunohistochemistry was
associated with significantly decreased survival in patients
with early-stage invasive breast cancer (2). To our knowledge, no reported studies have found significant correlations
between α5β1-integrin and clinical outcome in breast
cancer. To investigate whether α5-integrin expression is associated with survival in breast cancer, we queried a gene
expression data set that included the microarray profiles of

α5-integrin gene expression is associated with significantly decreased long-term survival in patients with breast cancer. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of

survival. P values (log-rank) between upper and lower or interquartile are <0.007.

295 patients with clinical follow-up (12). We found that high
α5-integrin gene expression is significantly associated with
decreased survival (Fig. 1C), and of this group, 61.6%
were estrogen receptor–positive. These data indicate that
α5-integrin is a potentially important target for breast
cancer therapy.
Upregulation of fibronectin and its splice variant
EDA+ are associated with coordinate upregulation
of α5β1-integrin in malignant breast cancer cells in
3D lrECM
Fibronectin is the main ECM ligand of α5β1-integrin, which
interacts with α5β1-integrin through its Arg-Gly-Asp and
Pro-His-Ser-Arg-Asn synergy sequences (14). α5β1-Integrin
and its interaction with fibronectin have been shown to
mediate diverse roles in cancer cell survival, proliferation,
and invasion (15–18). We previously found that fibronectininhibitory antibodies induced the phenotypic reversion of
tumorigenic T4-2 cells, leading to the formation of normal
acinar structures with correct basal polarity in 3D lrECM

(19). Here, we further investigated the relationship between
fibronectin and α5β1-integrin expression in T4-2 malignant
cells. We found that like α5β1-integrins, total fibronectin
was significantly upregulated in T4-2 cells in 3D lrECM.
In addition, we did not observe enhanced α5-integrin expression in two-dimensional cultures despite the addition
of exogenous fibronectin (Fig. 2A).
We reasoned that malignant T4-2 cells, but not nonmalignant S1 cells, may be producing endogenous fibronectin in
3D lrECM cultures, which could effectively interact with
the upregulated α5β1-integrin. When we measured total fibronectin protein levels in the conditioned medium of T4-2
cells in 3D lrECM compared with S1 cells, we found that fibronectin was secreted by T4-2 cells at a 9.4-fold higher level
than S1 cells (Fig. 2B). In addition, fibronectin is known to
contain several alternatively spliced domains. One species,
EDA+ fibronectin, in particular, is expressed during embryogenesis and wound healing (20, 21). Remarkably, we found
that this EDA+ segment is upregulated 22-fold in the conditioned medium of T4-2 cells in 3D lrECM, compared with S1

α5β1-Integrin and Fibronectin Targeting in Breast Cancer

Figure 2. Upregulation of fibronectin and its splice variant EDA+ are associated with coordinate upregulation of α5β1-integrin in malignant breast
cancer cells in 3D lrECM. A, upregulation of α5-integrin is not dependent on activation by ECM ligands on two-dimensional culture but required
three-dimensional culture conditions. B, fibronectin (FN) secretion is upregulated in T4-2 cells compared with S1 cells in 3D lrECM. Twenty microliters of
conditioned-medium (CM) from S1 or T4-2 cells were subjected to immunoblotting using fibronectin antibodies. The signals of immunoblotting were

cells (Fig. 2B). We also confirmed that mRNA levels of total
fibronectin and EDA+ segment are upregulated in T4-2 cells
compared with S1 cells (Fig. 2C).
To investigate whether the upregulation of α5-integrin,
β1-integrin, total fibronectin, and EDA+ fibronectin in malignant breast cancer cells is a general phenomenon, we measured their expression levels in several additional breast
cancer cell lines. We found that highly aggressive metastatic
breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-231, and
Hs578T), which are of the basal molecular phenotype (22),
showed a robust coordinate upregulation of α5-integrin and
β-integrin, total fibronectin, and EDA+ fibronectin (Fig. 2D).
Interestingly, by contrast, MCF-7, SKBR-3, MDA-MB-361 cell
lines, all of luminal phenotype, did not display a similar robust
upregulation of α5β1-integrins or fibronectin in 3D lrECM.
These results indicate that malignant breast cells of the basal
phenotype preferentially upregulate the fibronectin-α5β1integrin ligand-receptor pair in 3D lrECM, and synthesize
and secrete predominantly the fibronectin EDA+ variant,
which is known to play a role in tumorigenesis (23).
Specific inhibition of the α5β1-integrin-fibronectin
interaction by ATN-161 induces apoptosis in malignant
breast cancer cells in 3D lrECM
α5β1-Integrin interacts with the Arg-Gly-Asp and Pro-HisSer-Arg-Asn sequences of fibronectin (14). ATN-161 is a small
peptide that was previously shown to decrease angiogenesis
by disrupting the α5β1-integrin or αvβ3-integrin interaction
with the Pro-His-Ser-Arg-Asn synergy region of fibronectin
(24–26). We asked whether α5β1-integrin interaction with fibronectin is essential for survival and could be targeted to
enhance therapeutic effect in T4-2 cells. We previously found
that inhibition of β1-integrin by AIIB2 for 72 hours was effective in killing cancer cells, with little or no effect in nonmalignant S1 colonies (6). Examination of the consequences of
specifically inhibiting α5β1-integrin-fibronectin interactions
using ATN-161 in the 3D lrECM assay (Fig. 3A) revealed that
the growth of T4-2 colonies—but not S1 colonies—was significantly reduced (Fig. 3B). ATN-161–induced apoptosis of
T4-2 cells was measured by counting terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL)–positive nuclei at concentrations of 0.5 mg/mL
(mean = 8.3%, P < 0.001) or 2.0 mg/mL (mean = 23.4%, P <
0.001) ATN-161 (Fig. 3C). In keeping with its effect on inhibiting α5β1-integrin signaling, ATN-161 treatment also induced
the downregulation of α5β1-integrin protein expression in
T4-2 cells cultured in 3D lrECM (Fig. 4B). Consistent with
previous results using β1-integrin inhibitory antibodies,
ATN-161 did not significantly affect apoptosis in nonmalignant S1 cells in 3D lrECM (Fig. 3B and C). Of note, the scrambled peptide, ATN-163, did not affect apoptosis in T4-2 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
It has been reported that ATN-161 can also target other
integrin heterodimers, specifically αvβ3-integrin (24). We
also detected a modestly elevated level of αv-integrins in
T4-2 cells compared with S1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2).
To validate α5β1-integrin as a specific target, we tested two
separate clones of α5- integrin inhibitory antibodies, IIA1 and

5242

Cancer Res; 70(13) July 1, 2010

P1D6. Consistent with ATN-161 results, inhibition of α5β1integrin by these inhibitory antibodies effectively induced apoptosis of T4-2 cells, but not S1 cells, in 3D lrECM (Fig. 3D).
Akt activity mediates survival downstream of α5β1integrin pathway in malignant T4-2 cells in 3D lrECM
We previously showed that Akt played a role in conferring
resistance to apoptosis post-IR and in response to β1integrin inhibitory antibodies, which could be overcome by
administering increasing concentrations of inhibitory antibodies (13). Akt serine/threonine protein kinase activity is mediated through the phosphorylation of serine 473 and has
been implicated in cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis (27).
Here, we verified that Akt kinase activity and Akt phosphorylation were downregulated by α5β1-integrin inhibition
(Fig. 4A and B). Akt phosphorylation was not affected by
ATN-161 on S1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Furthermore, we tested α5β1-integrin and fibronectin inhibition on T4-2 myr-Akt cells, which express constitutively
active Akt (13), and confirmed that T4-2 myr-Akt cells were
resistant to ATN-161–induced apoptosis (Fig. 4C). These data
indicate that sustained malignant growth and survival in the
context of 3D lrECM is mediated at least in part by Akt
downstream of α5β1-integrin, and cellular death may be targeted directly through ECM signaling pathways.
α5β1-Integrin heterodimer is upregulated after IR
exposure in malignant T4-2 cells in 3D lrECM
β1-Integrin expression has previously been shown to be
upregulated by IR in lung cancer cell lines and breast epithelial cells (28, 29), and to mediate cellular resistance to apoptosis after IR (7). In addition, α5β1-integrin interaction with
fibronectin has been shown to play an important role in cell
survival, including that of breast cancer cells (30–32). Thus,
we hypothesized that α5β1-integrins at the cell surface after
IR exposure could potentially increase survival signaling by
enhanced interaction with fibronectin and thus could be
targeted to enhance therapy. The surface expression of α5integrins was measured by biotin labeling of cell surface
proteins on T4-2 cells cultured in 3D lrECM. Total protein
lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation by anti–α5integrin antibody, followed by immunoblotting using HRPconjugated streptavidin. Surface expression of α5-integrins
was most prominent after 2 Gy, and upregulation also occurred after 4 Gy IR on T4-2 cells cultured in 3D lrECM
(Fig. 5A). Consistent with this result, localization of α5integrins was observed also at the plasma membrane after
IR by confocal immunofluorescence (Fig. 5B). These data indicate that α5β1-integrin is upregulated significantly by IR
exposure, and that enhanced expression was reflected in
the level of surface expression, which could potentially be
targeted to enhance IR efficacy.
IR exposure in combination with α5β1-integrin
inhibition enhances apoptosis in T4-2 and
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines in 3D lrECM
We previously reported that β1 integrin inhibition enhances IR efficacy in several breast cancer cell lines cultured

treated with IR alone, those treated with ATN-161 post-IR
showed a significant increase in apoptosis (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, treatment with ATN-161 pre-IR in this case was not

effective (Fig. 6C). These data indicate that inhibition of
α5β1-integrin enhances the IR effect on the apoptosis of malignant breast cancer cells, and that sequencing may be an
important factor in determining the optimal treatment.

Discussion
We previously reported on the therapeutic potential of targeting β1-integrins showing that β1-integrin inhibitory antibodies could selectively enhance apoptosis and cytostasis in
malignant breast cancer cells in 3D lrECM and in vivo, and
increase the efficacy of IR without toxicity to normal tissues
(6, 13). In the present work, we provide a more in-depth investigation of the α5β1-integrin heterodimer and reveal a
novel relationship between expression of the α5β1-integrin
receptor and its ligand, fibronectin. We show that the
α5β1-integrin heterodimer is specifically and strikingly upregulated in malignant T4-2 breast cancer cells in 3D lrECM
and after IR, and that total fibronectin as well as the oncofetal EDA+ variant of fibronectin are coordinately upregulated
in aggressive breast cancer cell lines of the basal molecular
phenotype. We further show that the α5β1-integrin-fibronectin
interaction can be specifically targeted using a specific small
peptide inhibitor, ATN-161, and α5-integrin inhibitory antibodies to induce apoptosis through an Akt-mediated mechanism. Importantly, we also find that high α5-integrin gene
expression is associated with significantly decreased survival
in patients with invasive breast cancer, providing a potential

versal function in progression in several cancer types. We
found that α5β1-integrin and fibronectin, its primary ligand,
are coordinately upregulated in several aggressive breast cell
lines of the basal phenotype. The addition of exogenous fibronectin has been previously shown to upregulate α5-integrin
expression in Caco2-BBE human intestinal cells in twodimensional culture (36). In the present study, we found that
upregulation of α5β1-integrin in T4-2 cells is observed only in
the 3D lrECM context and that coating flat surfaces with ECM
components was not sufficient to elicit the increased response. Others have shown that a three-dimensional environment is important for α5β1-integrin localization and α5β1integrin–mediated matrix assembly in fibroblasts (37, 38).
Our results highlight the importance of α5β1-integrin–
mediated ECM remodeling in tumor progression and the dependence of three-dimensional architecture on this process.
We also found that the EDA+ variant of fibronectin was
specifically overexpressed in these cells. Others have shown
that EDA+ fibronectin is overexpressed in wound healing
and some tumors, although it is poorly represented in the
ECM of adult normal tissues (21, 39). In breast cancer,
EDA+ fibronectin is expressed in the normal-appearing stroma of ductal carcinoma in situ lesions and strongly elaborated in invasive breast cancer (40). It has been proposed
that the EDA domain inclusion may mediate a conformational change in the whole molecule, hence increasing
cell-ECM interaction through the binding to α5β1-integrin

(41). Thus, we hypothesize that malignant cells increase
EDA+ fibronectin to enhance survival signaling through
α5β1-integrin. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms
of the upregulation of α5β1-integrins and its relation to fibronectin in malignant breast cancer cells are still unknown.
Molecular phenotyping has led to the increased understanding of the developmental origins of some breast cancers and has provided tools to more accurately assess
individual risk for metastasis (42). The basal phenotype is
more aggressive in patients and is associated with significantly decreased survival (43). We found that the cell lines

that showed significant coordinate upregulation of α5β1integrin and EDA+ fibronectin were of the basal phenotype
(22). Interestingly, none of the luminal cell types tested
showed the same upregulation. We confirmed that 61.6%
of ITGA5-high population in the survival analysis is estrogen
receptor positive, which corresponds to the luminal subtype.
These results indicate that the association between ITGA5
expression and outcome in breast cancer is independent of
molecular subtype. Further investigations to validate these
results and investigate the potential underpinnings of these
correlations are ongoing.

α5β1-Integrin and Fibronectin Targeting in Breast Cancer

Previous studies with ATN-161 had focused on its ability
to suppress tumor growth by inhibiting angiogenesis in vivo
(25, 44) primarily by targeting α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins.
Others have previously found that inhibition of αv-integrins
may affect primary tumor growth and increase sensitivity to
IR (45). Our study indicates that the primary tumor cell survival signaling may also be targeted using ATN-161, resulting
in downregulation of α5β1-integrin through the suppression
of Akt activity, which has been implicated in cell survival by
inhibiting apoptosis (46). In addition, we and others have
shown previously that Akt activity is a promising target in
cancer cells downstream of β1-integrin signaling post-IR
(13, 47). In the present study, our extended findings support
the role of Akt in mediating survival through α5β1-integrin
signaling specifically.
β1-Integrin expression is aberrantly upregulated post-IR
and has been implicated in survival and resistance to IR in
several cancer cell types (7, 48). However, the nature of the
specific β1-integrin heterodimers that are upregulated post-IR
or their relationship with IR dose has not been well studied.
Here, we found that both total and cell surface expression of
α5β1-integrin were increased after IR in T4-2 cells, suggesting
that the increase in α5β1-integrin signaling contributes to survival signaling post-IR in 3D lrECM. The peak upregulation of
α5β1-integrin occurred after 2-Gy exposure, and the degree of
upregulation decreased with increasing radiation dose. Others
have shown that upregulation of β1-integrins occurs after a
single dose of 6 Gy in lung cancer cell lines (29). Upregulation
of endothelial αvβ3-integrin was observed after 2 Gy, reaching
a plateau at 15 Gy (49), and αIIbβ3-integrin with doses ranging
between 0.5 to 2.5 Gy in melanoma cells (50). Onoda and colleagues (50) showed a dose-dependent increase in B16 melanoma cells' adhesion to fibronectin post-IR; they also showed
that maximum increase in adhesion occurs after exposure to
0.5 Gy. Thus, our current findings are within the range of
dose-response reported by others. However, the nature of response of integrin levels to dose of radiation and the relationship to tissue specific integrin heterodimers need
further investigation.
In our study, we found that the addition of ATN-161 treatment following 2 Gy IR resulted in a significant increase in
apoptosis of both T4-2 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells compared with single treatments. The sequencing of biological
agents with IR can be an important factor in optimizing
treatment. To test the effect of sequencing, we treated cultures with ATN-161 before IR exposure. We found that in

T4-2 cells, reverse sequencing was not distinguishable from
treatment with ATN-161 post-IR. However, when MDA-MB231 cells were treated with IR following ATN-161, an enhanced apoptotic effect was not observed. We hypothesize
that the effect of ATN-161 or IR may be influenced by several
factors, such as expression level of α5β1-integrin in tumor
cells, or the availability of fibronectin in tumor microenvironment, which will be important areas of future investigation.
In summary, in the context of 3D lrECM, malignant breast
cancer cells of the basal phenotype strikingly upregulate
α5β1-integrin coordinately with its primary ligand, fibronectin in its oncofetal form. Inhibition of α5β1-integrin and fibronectin interaction using ATN-161 and anti–α5-integrin
inhibitory antibodies results in apoptosis in malignant T4-2
cells in 3D lrECM. In addition, α5β1-integrins are upregulated in malignant T4-2 cells after IR, and the combination
of ATN-161 and 2 Gy IR enhanced apoptosis compared with
single treatments in breast cancer cells. Finally, we found
that α5-integrin gene overexpression is associated with decreased survival in breast cancer patients. Together, our findings indicate that α5β1-integrin and its ligand fibronectin
are important for survival signaling in breast cancer and
are important targets for therapy.
